Mortality in single fathers compared with single mothers 
and partnered parents: a population-based cohort study
Maria Chiu, Farah Rahman, Simone Vigod, Cindy Lau, John Cairney, Paul Kurdyak
Summary
Background Single parent families, including families headed by single fathers, are becoming increasingly common 
around the world. Previous evidence suggests that single parenthood is associated with adverse health outcomes and 
increased mortality; however, most studies have focused on single mothers, with little known about the health of 
single fathers. This study aimed to examine mortality in a large population-based sample of Canadian single fathers 
compared with single mothers and partnered fathers and mothers.
Methods We used a representative sample of 871 single fathers, 4590 single mothers, 16 341 partnered fathers, and 
18 688 partnered mothers from the Canadian Community Health Survey (cycles 2001–12; earliest survey date: 
Sept 5, 2000; latest survey date: Dec 24, 2012). We anonymously linked survey participants to health administrative 
database records to ascertain health status at baseline and mortality from survey date up to Oct 28, 2016. We included 
individuals who were aged 15 years or older, living in a household with one or more biological or adopted child 
younger than 25 years, and living in Ontario, and we excluded those who left Ontario during the study period or had 
data discrepancies. Single parents were defined as those who were divorced, separated, widowed, or single, never-
married, and non-cohabitating, and partnered parents were defined as those who were married or common-law 
partners. We investigated differences in mortality using Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for 
sociodemographic, lifestyle, and clinical factors.
Findings Median follow-up was 11·10 years (IQR 7·36–13·54). Mortality in single fathers (5·8 per 1000 person-years) 
was three-times higher than rates in single mothers (1·74 per 1000 person-years) and partnered fathers (1·94 per 
1000 person-years). Single fathers had a significantly higher adjusted risk of dying than both single mothers 
(hazard ratio [HR] 2·49, 95% CI 1·20–5·15; p=0·01) and partnered fathers (2·06, 1·11–3·83; p=0·02).
Interpretation In this first head-to-head comparison of mortality across single and partnered parent groups, we found 
that single fathers had the least favourable risk factor profile and greatest risk of mortality. Social histories might help 
physicians identify these high-risk patients. Further work is needed to understand the causes of this high mortality 
risk and how clinical and public health interventions can improve lifestyle and behavioural risk factors.

Introduction
Single-parent families headed by fathers are a growing 
demographic in many regions of the world, which is 
largely due to increasing rates of divorce, separations, 
and non-marital childbearing.1–3 In 2011, more than 
2·6 million households in the USA (a nine-times increase 
since the 1960s) and approximately 330 000 (3·5%) of all 
census households in Canada were headed by single 
fathers.4,5 There are nearly 3 million single parent families 
in the UK, of which approximately 10% are single fathers 
with dependent children.6 Although parental status might 
not be directly modifiable by clinicians, single parenthood 
is readily ascertainable and is an important social factor 
that has been shown to adversely affect health.7–9 To date, 
research on single parents has largely focused on 
single mothers. Single mothers generally have lower 
socioeconomic status, poorer self-rated health and mental 
health, higher levels of psychological distress, and more 
health-related problems and hospital admissions than 
the general population.7–10 Emerging evidence shows 
that single fatherhood is also associated with some of 
these sociodemographic and health-related disparities.9,11 
Findings from an earlier study11 by our group showed that 
single fathers were twice as likely to report poor self-rated 
health and mental health than single mothers, but were 
only half as likely to access health services. However, data 
on the health profiles and mortality risk in single fathers 
are scarce. Such information could be relevant to 
physicians, who are often aware of their patient’s marital 
and parental status as part of their social history.
Previous studies7,8,10 have shown that single mothers have 
a 1·2 to 1·7-times greater mortality than partnered mothers 
when followed up for up to two decades, which might be 
associated with inadequate household resources, social 
assistance, and employment status. Only one study11 has 
examined the association between single fatherhood and 
mortality, and found that single fathers had a 30% greater 
risk of mortality than partnered fathers. However, it

remains unclear how mortality in single fathers compare 
with single mothers and whether any difference can be 
explained by socioeconomic factors, lifestyle factors, health 
services, and other determinants of mortality.
The objectives of this study were to estimate mortality 
in a population-based sample of single fathers compared 
with partnered fathers and single and partnered mothers; 
and to explore whether any observed differences could be 
explained by measured determinants of health.
Methods
Study population
Our study population was derived from Statistics 
Canada’s cross-sectional Canadian Community Health 
Survey (CCHS) pooled cycles from 2001 to 2012 (response 
rate 67·0–84·7%; earliest survey date: Sept 5, 2000; latest 
survey date: Dec 24, 2012).12 Details about the CCHS 
methodology have been described elsewhere.13,14 Briefly, 
the CCHS is a nationally representative survey, which 
uses a consistent, multistage, stratified cluster sampling 
strategy to collect self-reported sociodemographic and 
health-related information from a representative sample 
of people in private dwellings. This study was approved 
by the research ethics board at Sunnybrook Health 
Sciences Centre. Informed consent was obtained from 
all study participants for administrative data linkages.
Exposures and outcomes
The CCHS defined single parents as divorced, separated, 
widowed, or single never married, non-cohabitating men 
(single fathers) or women (single mothers) aged 15 years 
or older living in a household with one or more biological 
or adopted child younger than 25 years and no 
other adults. Partnered parents were defined as married 
or common-law men (partnered fathers) or women 
(partnered mothers) aged 15 years or older living in a 
household with one or more biological or adopted child 
younger than 25 years.
Using unique encoded identifiers (encrypted health 
card numbers), we anonymously linked the CCHS 
respondents to Ontario health administrative databases 
held at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences. We 
obtained vital statistics and death dates from the Ontario 
Registered Persons Database and cause-specific mortality 
from the Office of the Registrar General Vital Statistics 
Death Database. We grouped causes of death into 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 classifi 
ca-
tions: neoplasms, diseases of the circulatory system, 
external causes of injury and poisoning, mental health-
related causes, diseases of the respiratory system, and 
other causes.
Sociodemographic characteristics included in this study 
were age, urban dwelling, white ethnicity, marital status, 
and education. Psychosocial stressor variables included 
were household income (<CAN$30 000, $30 000–59 999, 
≥$60 000), unemployment in the past year, not owning a 
home, living with at least one child younger than 6 years, 
living with at least one child between 6 and 11 years, and 
household size of three people or higher. Lifestyle factors 
included were current smoking, low fruit and vegetable 
consumption (<3 times per day), physical inactivity 
(energy expenditure <1·5 kcal/kg per day), obesity (body-
mass index ≥30 kg/m²), and monthly binge drinking 
(≥5 drinks in a sitting at least once a month). We also 
examined an indicator of social support, categorised as 
somewhat weak or very weak sense of belonging to a local 
community and very strong or somewhat strong sense of 
belonging (reference group). We linked the survey data to 
administrative databases to ascertain baseline prevalent 
medical conditions (cardiovascular disease, cancer, 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Much research has investigated the health outcomes of single 
mothers; however, the impact of single fatherhood on 
mortality remains unclear. On Feb 26, 2017, we searched 
Embase, MEDLINE, PsychInfo, and PubMed for articles with the 
search terms “mortality”, “death”, “single mother”, “single 
father”, “lone mother”, “lone father”, “single parent”, and 
“lone parent”. The search results found numerous studies 
showing that single mothers have a greater risk of mortality 
than partnered mothers; however, only one study examined 
the association between single fatherhood and mortality. 
Although single fathers had a greater risk of mortality than 
partnered fathers, evidence on their risk of mortality compared 
with single mothers is scarce.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the first population-based cohort study 
to investigate the risk of mortality associated with single 
fatherhood compared with single mothers, partnered mothers, 
and partnered fathers. Our study shows that single fathers had 
the least favourable risk factor profile and a mortality rate 
three-times higher than that of single mothers and partnered 
fathers. Single fathers also had a two-times higher adjusted 
hazard of death compared with both single mothers and 
partnered fathers.
Implications of all the available evidence
We found that single fathers, a growing population that has 
been largely understudied, have a poor behavioural and lifestyle 
risk factor profile, and higher risk of mortality than single 
mothers, partnered mothers, and partnered fathers. 
This research highlights single fathers as a high-risk group 
requiring close monitoring and management of lifestyle factors. 
Public health policies and clinical strategies might be needed to 
help identify and manage risk factors in single fathers. Further 
research is needed to understand the causes of their higher risk of 
mortality and to evaluate differences across study settings to 
help mitigate risk in this vulnerable population.

previously validated algorithms,15–20 health-service use 
data (outpatient visits, emergency department visits, and 
hospital admissions in the past year), and cancer 
registries.
Statistical analysis
We compared the baseline characteristics of single fathers 
with partnered fathers and single and partnered mothers 
and using χ² tests. We assessed continuous variables 
using one-way ANOVA for means and SDs and Kruskal-
Wallis test for the median and IQR. We included 
individuals living in Ontario and excluded those who left 
Ontario during the study period or had data discrepancies 
(eg, date of death earlier than survey date). Respondents 
were followed up from the date of the survey and censored 
at loss of provincial health coverage, which would censor 
those who emigrated out of the province, or end of study 
(Oct 28, 2016). We initially ran a model with an interaction 
term for single parent status and sex, which was found to 
be statistically significant (p=0·02), confirming that sex 
was an effect modifier. We then estimated mortality for 
single and partnered fathers and mothers and produced 
unadjusted cumulative incidence curves, which were 
compared using pairwise log-rank tests. We used Cox 
proportional hazards models to examine the associa 
tion 
between single parenthood and mortality. For multi-
variable, adjusted hazards models, we added covariates 
sequentially in the following blocks: socio 
demographics 
(age, urban dwelling, marital status, ethnicity, and 
education), psychosocial stressors (household income, 
employment, home ownership, living with child younger 
than 6 years, living with child aged 6–11 years, and 
household size), lifestyle factors (smoking status, fruit 
and vegetable consumption, physical inactivity, body-
mass index, and monthly binge drinking), chronic 
conditions (cardiovascular, cancer, respiratory conditions, 
hypertension, and diabetes), health-service use in the past 
year (any outpatient visit, emergency department visit, 
and hospital admission), and sense of belonging. All 
covariates were retained in the adjusted model on the 
basis of their clinical significance, irrespective of statistical 
significance. We also created cumulative incidence curves 
adjusted for all covariates using the group prognosis 
method.21 To ensure that findings were generalisable to 
the population of Ontario, all estimates were weighted by 
the sample weights provided by Statistics Canada and 
bootstrap methods using 500 bootstrap weights were 
used to calculate 95% CIs and p values.
To ensure that we adequately adjusted for age, we 
controlled for this variable in two ways: as a linear term 
in the main analysis, and as a restricted cubic spline with 
three knots to account for the potential non-linear 
relationship between age and death in a sensitivity 
analysis.22 Most covariates had up to 1% missing with the 
exception of household income, which had at most 
11% missing; missing values were excluded from 
analyses. As a sensitivity analysis, we adjusted the fully 
adjusted models for household income with imputed 
values derived with multiple imputations based on all 
covariates in the study, using SAS procedure PROC MI 
with a default of five imputed datasets.23 We regarded 
p<0·05 as significant, and did not adjust for multiple 
testing.

Results
The pooled CCHS cycles had a total of 200 922 respondents, 
of which 40 521 were single or partnered parents. We 
excluded six individuals because of data discrepancies 
and 25 individuals who were ineligible for provincial 
health care, resulting in our study population of 871 single 
fathers, 4590 single mothers, 16 341 partnered fathers, 
and 18 688 partnered mothers. Single fathers were 
significantly older than single mothers, partnered 
fathers, and partnered mothers and were more likely to 
be separated, divorced, or widowed than single mothers 
(table 1). Single fathers had significantly lower income 
and were more likely to be unemployed in the past year 
than partnered fathers, but not single mothers. Single 
fathers were more likely to be white, had lower fruit and 
vegetable consumption, and were more likely to monthly 
binge drink than single mothers and partnered fathers

Data are from Canadian Community Health Survey years 2001–12, respondents were followed up for a median of 11·10 years (IQR 7·36–13·54). All estimates are weighted by 
the survey weights and 95% CIs were estimated using bootstrap methods.

and mothers. At baseline, cancer was more prevalent in 
single fathers than in the other three study groups and 
cardiovascular diseases were more prevalent in single 
fathers than single mothers and partnered mothers. A 
greater proportion of single fathers had an emergency 
department visit and hospital admission in the past year 
than partnered fathers (table 1).
Each group was followed up for a maximum of 15 years, 
totalling 425 073 person-years. Median follow-up was 
11·10 years (IQR 7·36–13·54) and was similar across the 
four exposure groups, as was the degree of censoring. 
Partnered mothers had the lowest mortality, followed by 
similar rates between single mothers and partnered 
fathers, and single fathers had the highest mortality 
(5·81 per 1000 person-years), three-times greater than 
single mothers and partnered fathers (table 2, figure 1). 
This higher rate corresponded to unadjusted hazard 
ratios [HRs] of 3·34 (95% CI 1·78–6·25) versus single 
mothers, and 3·02 (1·75–5·24) versus partnered fathers 
(figure 2, appendix).
The HRs decreased, but remained significant after 
adjustment for age and other sociodemographic 
characteristics, stressors, lifestyle factors, chronic 
conditions, health-service use, and sense of belonging 
(HR 2·49, 95% CI 1·20–5·15; p=0·01 for single fathers vs 
single mothers, and 2·06, 1·11–3·83; p=0·02 for single 
fathers vs partnered fathers; figures 2, 3, appendix). 
Incidence of death was more similar between single and 
partnered mothers than between single and partnered 
fathers (figure 3).
Neoplasms were the leading cause of death in partnered 
parents, whereas the most likely cause of death was “other 
causes” (most of which were listed as unknown in the 
Vital Statistics Death Database) followed by neoplasms in 
single parents (appendix). External causes of injury and 
poisoning were also substantial contributors to mortality 
among single mothers. Low numbers of deaths resulted 
in wide, overlapping confidence intervals, and categories 
with fewer than six deaths were not reported (to 
reduce risk of de 
anonymisation) precluding further 
categorisation of other causes of death (appendix).
HRs for single fathers remained consistently elevated 
after adjustment for age using restricted cubic splines 
(HR 2·48, 95% CI 1·19–5·18, p=0·02 compared with 
single mothers, and 2·06, 1·11–3·82, p=0·02 compared 
with partnered fathers; appendix). The results were 
similar to the main analysis after adjustment for the 
imputed household income values, irrespective of 
whether age was included as a linear term or restricted 
cubic splines. We also ran the final model with 
20 imputations, which produced similar results as those 
run with five imputed datasets (appendix).
Discussion
In this population-based study of single and partnered 
parents followed up for a median of 11 years, we found 
that single fathers had several risk factors that were

associated with premature mortality, including lower fruit 
and vegetable consumption and greater monthly binge 
drinking. Single fathers had by far the highest mortality 
and after adjustment for age, other sociodemographic 
factors, stressors, lifestyle, chronic con 
ditions, health-
service use, and sense of belonging, the risk of mortality 
remained significantly higher than both single mothers 
and partnered fathers.
To our knowledge, only one earlier study11 by 
Ringbäck Weitoft and colleagues using Swedish national 
register and census data has assessed the risk of mortality 
in single fathers. Findings from the study,11 which analysed 
mortality data from 1991–2000, showed that single fathers 
had a significant 30% higher risk of mortality than 
cohabiting fathers after controlling for health selection 
effects (eg, previous inpatient history) and socioeconomic 
circumstances. Although both our study and the study 
from Sweden showed an elevated risk in single fathers 
compared with partnered fathers, the difference in the 
effect sizes might be explained by the different populations 
and settings and the use of more contemporary data and 
longer follow-up in our study. No previous study has 
directly compared mortality risk in single fathers and 
single or partnered mothers. Our mortality estimates in 
both single and partnered mothers, however, are similar 
to 
those 
observed 
in 
previous 
population-based 
research.7,8,10 Similar to our study showing that single 
mothers had a higher mortality for external causes of 
injury and poisoning compared with partnered mothers, 
Ringbäck Weitoft and coll 
eagues8 found that single 
mothers were at highest risk of death from injuries and 
poisoning than any other causes of death compared with 
partnered mothers. Only one previous study11 has 
examined cause of death in single fathers; this study 
showed that long-term lone custodial fathers were at the 
highest risk of death from ischaemic heart disease and 
traffic injury compared with other lone and cohabiting 
males. Given the different definitions for causes of death 
and single and partnered fathers, we were unable to make 
direct comparisons with our findings and those from the 
earlier study.
Studies on social support in the single father population 
are scarce. However, research has shown that single 
fathers are significantly less likely to have relationships 
and connections within and between social networks that 
could help to enhance their health, productivity, and 
wellbeing in society.24 Having fewer trusted companions 
to rely on and confide in could have a substantial effect 
on the risk of mortality in single fathers. Growing 
evidence in the medical literature suggests that loneliness 
and social isolation are important risk factors for early 
death and could be just as important as smoking and 
obesity in predicting premature mortality.25,26 Loneliness 
has also been associated with disrupted sleep patterns, 
higher levels of stress hormones, altered immune 
system, accelerated cognitive decline, and increased risk 
of heart disease.25–28 Nevertheless, further research is 
needed to establish a causal relationship between 
loneliness and premature mortality. Furthermore, given 
that there are more single mothers than fathers,4 support 
(eg, financial assistance, educational grants, and support 
groups) is more commonly available for single mothers 
and structural barriers, either real or perceived, might 
prevent men from accessing these community services. 
Other potential explanations for why single fathers fare 
worse than single mothers could be sex differences in 
occupational choices and the underuse of safety nets, 
such as social assistance and child support,11,29–31 which 
warrant future investigation.
Additionally, differences in the pathways into single 
parenthood for men and women might affect social risk 
and protective factors (eg, stress exposure and coping 
resources), resulting in differing health effects. For 
example, common pathways into single parenthood 
include divorce and separation.32 However, in our study, 
spousal bereavement was more common in single 
fathers than in single mothers, which could add sources 
of stress such as grief to their experiences.33 Although 
incomes of single fathers are higher than those of single 
mothers, largely due to higher rates of employment in 
men than women,34 the dual burden of working and 
being primary caregiver puts increased stress on men,

who traditionally do not find themselves in sole-parenting 
roles and might find it difficult to cope.35 Furthermore, 
parental conflict after separation worsens parental and 
child health.36 As such, children typically reside with 
their mothers after divorce or separation, so paternal 
custody might be an indicator of mental health and social 
functioning issues among the mother, which can further 
complicate matters and distress the single father.
Marriage has long been shown to have a protective 
effect on men’s health and social behaviours, in that 
married men are less likely to engage in risky activities 
and behaviours, such as risky driving and sexual 
behaviour, cigarette smoking, poor diet, alcohol 
consumption, and drug use, or delay seeking help.37,38 
Differences in access to care might also explain the 
disadvantage observed in single fathers compared with 
single mothers. Although Ontario has the benefit of a 
universal health-care system, men are less likely to seek 
care than women.39 Research has shown that men have 
poorer engagement with primary care and substantially 
fewer consultations with general practitioners than 
women. Specifically, lower awareness of symptoms, 
behavioural paradigms related to masculinity, and a 
general reluctance to access services could make men 
 
unwilling to overcome practical barriers to accessing 
health services, such as unpredictable waiting times and 
absence of extended clinic opening hours.40 Nevertheless, 
our study found that single fathers were more likely to 
have health-care encounters than partnered fathers. 
These encounters are opportunities for physicians to 
learn more about the social and life circumstances of this 
high-risk group and assess patients’ social environments.41 
A common dilemma experienced by doctors is the 
constraint on time spent talking with patients and the 
need to better understand the personal circumstances 
experienced by the patient. Research has shown that 
high-quality time spent talking to the patient and 
collecting information (eg, social histories) can help 
motivate patients to adhere to treatment plans, make 
better decisions about their health, and influence their 
behaviour and recovery.42 A detailed social history could 
allow physicians to ask about single fathers’ lifestyles and 
give advice on behavioural and lifestyle changes. 
Standard social history questions taught to medical 
students and implemented within daily health-care 
routines, such as “What do you do for a living?”, “Are you 
single or married?”, “Do you have children?”, and “Do 
you smoke or drink?” could promote the development of 
tailored strategies and help to identify struggling single 
fathers.
To our knowledge, this study is the first to compare the 
risk of mortality in single fathers with that of single 
mothers and partnered fathers. The use of survey and 
health administrative data collected under Ontario’s 
single-payer health-care system allowed us to study the 
profile of single fathers and follow up individuals 
longitudinally for up to 15 years to assess mortality, while 
adjusting for a comprehensive list of social, demographic, 
lifestyle, behavioural, chronic conditions, and health-
service factors. Our survey sample of single and 
partnered parents was also representative of the census 
population.4
This study has some limitations. First, we did not have 
information about the length of time individuals were 
single or partnered parents; however, there is no reason to 
believe that the arbitrary survey date created any 
differential bias between the single fathers and the 
reference groups. Second, some baseline data such as 
smoking, monthly binge drinking, and fruit and vegetable 
consumption were self-reported; however, we used 
administrative databases where possible to ascertain 
factors such as baseline chronic medical conditions and 
health-service use. Third, we had information only about 
the exposure and covariates at baseline and we were not 
able to track changes over time. Fourth, although our 
analysis adjusted for key risk factors, such as smoking, 
fruit and vegetable consumption, and monthly binge 
drinking, there might be nuances in the lifestyle and 
behavioural profile of single fathers (eg, pack-years of 
cigarettes smoked, other dimensions of social support, 
occupational type, other measures of alcohol consumption 
to adequately capture differences in exposure to alcohol 
across groups, or other risky behaviours) that the study 
was not able to capture. Fifth, we relied on the survey 
definitions of single parents and children in a given 
household. The CCHS survey defines a single parent as 
someone who is divorced, separated, widowed, or single 
and never married, but some single parents are separated 
and still married. Similarly, 25 years is a high age cutoff
 
for the definition of children in the household. Sixth, 
given the low number of deaths in our study, there is 
uncertainty as to the degree of the increase in mortality 
risk in single fathers compared with the other groups, as 
well as our interpretation of cause-specific death. Further 
research is needed to understand the causes of death and 
the causal pathways between single fatherhood and death, 
including when all study participants are healthy at cohort 
inception. Future research should also investigate 
different living arrangements, because improved health 
outcomes in parents and children have been shown when 
children spend time equally between separated parents.43
In conclusion, in this population-based study 
comparing single fathers to single mothers and 
partnered fathers, we found that single fathers had a 
poor profile of behavioural and lifestyle risk factors and 
the highest mortality, which was only partly explained by 
sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. Our study 
highlights that single fathers, a growing demographic 
that is largely neglected, represent a particularly high-
risk group in terms of mortality. Given the trend towards 
patient-centred care and a growing recognition of the 
effect of social isolation and loneliness on premature 
death, close monitoring of risk factors in single fathers 
could provide physicians with opportunities to better

manage lifestyle and behavioural factors and intervene 
in a timely manner. Further work is needed to 
understand the causes of the increased mortality in 
single fathers and initiatives that might help support 
and mitigate risk.
