BACKGROUND
Romosozumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds sclerostin, increases bone for-
mation and decreases bone resorption.
METHODS
We enrolled 7180 postmenopausal women who had a T score of –2.5 to –3.5 at the 
total hip or femoral neck. Patients were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous 
injections of romosozumab (at a dose of 210 mg) or placebo monthly for 12 months; 
thereafter, patients in each group received denosumab for 12 months, at a dose of 
60 mg, administered subcutaneously every 6 months. The coprimary end points 
were the cumulative incidences of new vertebral fractures at 12 months and 24 
months. Secondary end points included clinical (a composite of nonvertebral and 
symptomatic vertebral) and nonvertebral fractures.
RESULTS
At 12 months, new vertebral fractures had occurred in 16 of 3321 patients (0.5%) 
in the romosozumab group, as compared with 59 of 3322 (1.8%) in the placebo 
group (representing a 73% lower risk with romosozumab; P<0.001). Clinical frac-
tures had occurred in 58 of 3589 patients (1.6%) in the romosozumab group, as 
compared with 90 of 3591 (2.5%) in the placebo group (a 36% lower risk with 
romosozumab; P 
= 
0.008). Nonvertebral fractures had occurred in 56 of 3589 patients 
(1.6%) in the romosozumab group and in 75 of 3591 (2.1%) in the placebo group 
(P 
= 
0.10). At 24 months, the rates of vertebral fractures were significantly lower in 
the romosozumab group than in the placebo group after each group made the 
transition to denosumab (0.6% [21 of 3325 patients] in the romosozumab group 
vs. 2.5% [84 of 3327] in the placebo group, a 75% lower risk with romosozumab; 
P<0.001). Adverse events, including instances of hyperostosis, cardiovascular 
events, osteoarthritis, and cancer, appeared to be balanced between the groups. 
One atypical femoral fracture and two cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw were ob-
served in the romosozumab group.
CONCLUSIONS
In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, romosozumab was associated with 
a lower risk of vertebral fracture than placebo at 12 months and, after the transi-
tion to denosumab, at 24 months. The lower risk of clinical fracture that was seen 
with romosozumab was evident at 1 year. (Funded by Amgen and UCB Pharma;

Romosozumab in Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis
O
steoporosis can lead to fragility 
fractures, which result in clinical burden 
and increased mortality.1,2 Even after a 
fracture, fewer than 25% of patients receive phar-
macologic treatment for osteoporosis.3-5 After the 
discovery that sclerostin deficiency causes rare 
genetic conditions that are characterized by high 
bone mass and resistance to fracture,6,7 sclerostin 
became a therapeutic target for the treatment 
of osteoporosis. Sclerostin, a negative regulator 
of bone formation that is secreted by osteocytes,8 
inhibits Wnt signaling, down-regulating this stim-
ulus for osteoblast development and function.9
Romosozumab (Amgen and UCB Pharma) is 
a monoclonal antibody that binds and inhibits 
sclerostin, with a dual effect of increasing bone 
formation and decreasing bone resorption.10,11 In 
a phase 2 trial involving postmenopausal women 
with low bone mass, treatment with romosozu-
mab for 1 year (at a dose of 210 mg, adminis-
tered subcutaneously monthly) significantly in-
creased bone mineral density, with increases in 
levels of bone-formation markers over the first 
6 to 9 months of treatment and persistent de-
creases in levels of bone-resorption markers.10 
On the basis of those results, we undertook a 
phase 3 trial that evaluated the effects of 1 year 
of romosozumab treatment on the risk of frac-
ture among women with postmenopausal osteo-
porosis. Given evidence that bone mineral den-
sity is maintained or potentially increased after 
the transition from treatment with a bone-
forming agent to treatment with an antiresorp-
tive agent,12,13 we also assessed follow-on therapy 
with denosumab as sequential treatment for 
osteoporosis.
Methods
Trial Design
The Fracture Study in Postmenopausal Women 
with Osteoporosis (FRAME) was an international, 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group trial. Women were randomly as-
signed, in a 1:1 ratio, with the use of an inter-
active voice-response system, to receive romosozu-
mab in a blinded fashion at a dose of 210 mg or 
placebo. Randomization was stratified according 
to age (<75 years vs. ≥75 years) and prevalent 
vertebral fracture (yes vs. no). Romosozumab or 
placebo was administered subcutaneously once 
monthly for 12 months, followed by open-label 
denosumab at a dose of 60 mg (Prolia, Amgen), 
which was administered subcutaneously every 6 
months for an additional 12 months (Fig. 1). 
Patients, investigators, and sponsors remained 
unaware of the initial treatment assignment.
Trial Oversight
The trial protocol, available with the full text of 
this article at NEJM.org, was approved by an ethics 
committee or institutional review board at each 
trial center. Patients provided written informed 
consent. Amgen and UCB Pharma designed the 
trial, and Amgen was responsible for trial over-
sight. An external independent data and safety 
monitoring committee monitored unblinded safe-
ty data. Amgen conducted the data analyses ac-
cording to a prespecified statistical analysis plan.
Three of the authors (one academic author 
and two employees of Amgen) vouch for the ac-
curacy and completeness of the data and analy-
ses reported and for the fidelity of the trial to 
the protocol. The authors had access to the data, 
with agreements relating to data confidentiality. 
The first two authors wrote the first draft of the 
manuscript, with assistance from professional 
medical writers who were funded by Amgen. All 
the authors contributed to subsequent drafts and 
made the decision to submit the manuscript for 
publication.
Patients
Ambulatory postmenopausal women, 55 to 90 
years of age, with a T score of −2.5 to −3.5 at the 
total hip or femoral neck were eligible for par-
ticipation. Patients had to have at least two ver-
tebrae in the L1 through L4 region and at least 
one hip that could be evaluated by means of 
dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Women who 
had a history of hip fracture, any severe or more 
than two moderate vertebral fractures, a history 
of metabolic bone disease or conditions affect-
ing bone metabolism, osteonecrosis of the jaw, 
a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of less than 20 ng per 
milliliter, current hypercalcemia or hypocalcemia, 
or recent use of drugs affecting bone metabolism 
(within defined washout periods; see the protocol) 
were excluded. For patients in whom the base-
line serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was 40 ng 
per milliliter or less, a loading dose of 50,000 to 
60,000 IU of vitamin D was administered at the

time the trial regimen was started. All patients 
received daily calcium (500 to 1000 mg) and vi-
tamin D3 or D2 (600 to 800 IU).
Procedures
Lateral radiographs of the spine were obtained 
at scheduled visits (Fig. 1) or if back pain oc-
curred that was suggestive of vertebral fracture. 
Radiographs were assessed with the use of the 
Genant grading scale (grades range from 0 to 3, 
with higher grades indicating greater severity)14 
(see the Supplementary Appendix, available at 
NEJM.org) at a central imaging vendor (BioClinica). 
Patients were considered to have new vertebral 
fractures if there was an increase of at least one 
grade in previously normal vertebrae; determina-
tion that preexisting fractures had worsened also 
required an increase of at least one grade. The 
staff at the central imaging vendor, who were 
unaware of the treatment assignments, con-
firmed nonvertebral fractures by diagnostic im-
aging or by review of the radiologist’s report. 
Fractures of the skull, facial bones, metacarpals, 
fingers, and toes, pathologic fractures, and frac-
tures that were associated with severe trauma 
were excluded.
In a substudy involving 128 patients, the bone 
mineral density at the lumbar spine and proximal 
femur was evaluated by means of dual-energy 
x-ray absorptiometry (Lunar or Hologic) at base-
line and every 6 months (Fig. 1). Serum concen-
trations of the bone-turnover markers procolla-
gen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) and 
β-isomer of C-terminal telopeptide of type I 
collagen (β-CTX) were measured in a substudy 
involving 129 patients (Fig. 1).
Adverse events were reported by trial-site physi-
cians. Serious adverse events that were potentially 
cardiovascular-related, including deaths, and po-
tential cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw and 
atypical femoral fracture were identified with 
the use of prespecified search strategies and 
adjudicated by independent committees. Adverse 
events of interest included those that were rele-
vant to the injection of a monoclonal antibody or 
to calcium homeostasis and events that were 
Figure 1. Trial Regimens and Assessments.
Women were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive subcutaneous injections of 210 mg of romosozumab or 
placebo once monthly for 12 months during the double-blind phase of the trial. Patients then received open-label 
denosumab, administered subcutaneously at a dose of 60 mg every 6 months for an additional 12 months; the ini-
tial group assignment was still blinded. Patients were stratified according to age (<75 years vs. ≥75 years) and preva-
lent vertebral fracture (yes vs. no). In a substudy of the overall population that involved 128 patients, bone mineral 
density was assessed at baseline and every 6 months. In a substudy of the overall population that involved 129 pa-
tients, the levels of bone-turnover markers were assessed at baseline, at day 14, and at months 1, 3, 3+14 days, 6, 
6+14 days, 9, 12, 13, 18, and 24. After the 24-month trial period, patients continue to receive open-label denosumab 
in a 1-year extension study (data not shown).

Romosozumab in Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis
considered to be potentially related to hyperos-
tosis (as seen with excessive bone growth in 
genetic syndromes of sclerostin deficiency).6,15 
Anti-romosozumab antibodies were assessed at 
baseline and at months 1, 3, 6, 12, 15, and 24.
Primary and Secondary End Points
The coprimary end points were the cumulative 
incidences of new vertebral fracture at 12 months 
and at 24 months. Prespecified secondary end 
points included the cumulative incidence of clini-
cal fracture (a composite of nonvertebral fracture 
and symptomatic vertebral fracture), nonverte-
bral fracture, major nonvertebral fracture, new 
or worsening vertebral fracture, hip fracture, 
major osteoporotic fracture, and multiple new or 
worsening vertebral fractures at 12 months and 
at 24 months.
Statistical Analysis
Assuming an incidence of vertebral fracture of 
2.1% in the placebo group, we calculated that 
the trial would have more than 99% power to 
detect a 65% lower risk of new vertebral fracture 
in the romosozumab group over a period of 
12 months and a 62% lower risk in the romosozu-
mab group over a period of 24 months. Assum-
ing an incidence of clinical fracture of 3.9% and 
an incidence of nonvertebral fracture of 3.5% in 
the placebo group, we calculated that the trial 
would have 94% power to detect a 40% lower 
risk of clinical fracture and 91% power to de-
tect a 40% lower risk of nonvertebral fracture in 
the romosozumab group at 12 months. A fixed-
sequence testing procedure was used for the co-
primary end points and selected secondary end 
points to adjust for multiple comparisons and 
maintain an overall significance level of 0.05 
(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). If sta-
tistical significance was not reached at any point 
in the sequence, the remaining end points would 
be considered to be exploratory, and both the 
nominal and adjusted P values would be reported.
We used an intention-to-treat approach for all 
the analyses for the assessment of the treatment 
effect. Analyses of vertebral-fracture end points 
included all the patients who underwent ran-
domization and had a baseline radiograph and 
at least one radiograph obtained after the base-
line visit. When a radiograph assessment after 
baseline was missing, the status was imputed 
with the status from the last nonmissing visit 
after baseline; a post hoc multiple-imputation 
approach to handle missing data was also un-
dertaken as a sensitivity analysis.
For vertebral fracture, the risk ratio was de-
termined on the basis of the Mantel–Haenszel 
method, and the treatment comparison was as-
sessed with the use of a logistic-regression 
model that was stratified according to age (<75 
years vs. ≥75 years) and prevalent vertebral frac-
ture (yes vs. no). Analyses of other fracture end 
points included all the patients who underwent 
randomization. The cumulative incidence was 
summarized with the use of Kaplan–Meier esti-
mates, and treatment comparisons were based 
on a Cox proportional-hazards model that was 
stratified according to age and prevalent verte-
bral fracture.
A total of 11 subgroup categories, including 
those defined according to age, history of frac-
ture, T score, and geographic region, were pre-
specified for assessment of new vertebral, clinical, 
and nonvertebral fracture end points at 12 months 
and at 24 months. Treatment-by-subgroup inter-
actions were assessed with the use of the same 
statistical approach that was used to test the 
main treatment effect, without adjustment for 
multiple comparisons.
Percentage changes from baseline in bone 
mineral density and in the levels of bone-turn-
over markers were assessed in patients who had 
a baseline measurement and at least one assess-
ment after the baseline visit. Bone mineral den-
sity was analyzed with the use of an analysis-of-
covariance model with adjustment for baseline 
bone mineral density, machine type, and interac-
tion between baseline bone mineral density and 
machine type. We imputed missing values by 
carrying forward the last observation, and a sen-
sitivity analysis was performed with the use of a 
repeated-measures model. A Wilcoxon rank-sum 
test was used to assess the treatment difference 
with regard to the percentage change from base-
line in the levels of bone-turnover markers.
The safety analysis included all the patients 
who underwent randomization and received at 
least one dose of placebo or romosozumab in 
the 12-month double-blind period. Incidence rates 
at 24 months were cumulative and included all 
the events in the double-blind period and all the 
events in the open-label period that occurred in 
patients who received at least one dose of den-
osumab.

Romosozumab in Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis
mean bone mineral density T scores were −2.72 
at the lumbar spine, −2.47 at the total hip, and 
−2.75 at the femoral neck. A total of 1317 pa-
tients (18.3%) had a prevalent vertebral fracture 
(the majority of which were mild in severity), and 
1560 (21.7%) had a previous nonvertebral frac-
ture. The geographic regions with the highest 
enrollment were Latin America (3084 patients) 
and Central or Eastern Europe (2093 patients).
12-Month Fracture Efficacy
Romosozumab was associated with a risk of 
new vertebral fracture that was 73% lower than 
the risk with placebo at 12 months (incidence, 
0.5% [16 of 3321 patients] in the romosozumab 
group vs. 1.8% [59 of 3322] in the placebo 
group; risk ratio, 0.27; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], 0.16 to 0.47; P<0.001) (Fig. 2A, and Table S2 
in the Supplementary Appendix). By 6 months, 
Figure 2. Incidence of New Vertebral, Clinical, and Nonvertebral Fractures.
The coprimary end points were the cumulative incidences of new vertebral fracture at 12 months and at 24 months (Panel A). The risk 
ratio was assessed among patients in the romosozumab group as compared with those in the placebo group at 12 months (end of the 
double-blind period) and at 24 months (by which time patients in both groups had received open-label denosumab for 12 months). 
Data from patients who underwent randomization and had a baseline radiograph and at least one radiograph obtained after the base-
line visit are included here. Kaplan–Meier curves of the first clinical fracture (Panel B) and the first nonvertebral fracture (Panel C) from 
the time-to-event analysis are shown, including the double-blind period through 12 months and the period with open-label denosumab 
from 12 to 24 months. The insets show the same data on an enlarged y axis. Data from patients who withdrew from the trial or who 
reached the end of the reporting period without having a fracture were censored at the last observation time. P values are for results at 
12 months and 24 months and are based on a Cox proportional-hazards model with adjustment for age and prevalent vertebral fracture, 
adjusted for multiple comparisons.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
new vertebral fractures had occurred in 14 patients 
in the romosozumab group and in 26 in the pla-
cebo group. Between 6 months and 12 months, 
fractures occurred in 2 additional patients in the 
romosozumab group, as compared with 33 addi-
tional patients in the placebo group. Romosoz-
umab was also associated with a risk of clinical 
fracture that was 36% lower than the risk with 
placebo at 12 months; fractures occurred in 58 
of 3589 patients (1.6%) in the romosozumab 
group vs. 90 of 3591 (2.5%) in the placebo group 
(hazard ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.89; 
P 
= 
0.008) (Fig. 2B, and Table S2 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
Nonvertebral fractures constituted the major-
ity (>85%) of clinical fractures. Nonvertebral 
fractures occurred in 56 patients (1.6%) in the 
romosozumab group and in 75 (2.1%) in the 
placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.53 
to 1.05; P 
= 
0.10) (Fig. 2C, and Table S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Owing to the lack of 
statistical significance for the nonvertebral end 
point and the prespecified testing sequence, all 
other 12-month fracture end-point analyses were 
considered to be exploratory (Table S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
The treatment effect in prespecified sub-
groups was consistent with regard to new verte-
bral, clinical, and nonvertebral fractures (data not 
shown), except with regard to clinical and non-
vertebral fractures across geographic regions, for 
which significant treatment-by-region interactions 
were observed (P 
= 
0.03 and P 
= 
0.04, respective-
ly). These findings were evaluated in a post hoc 
analysis that showed that the incidence of non-
vertebral fracture in the region of Latin America 
was 1.5% (24 of 1550 patients) in the romosoz-
umab group versus 1.2% (19 of 1534) in the 
placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.68 
to 2.27). By contrast, among the patients outside 
the region of Latin America, the incidence was 
1.6% (32 of 2039) in the romosozumab group 
versus 2.7% (56 of 2057) in the placebo group, 
representing a risk that was 42% lower in the 
romosozumab group (hazard ratio, 0.58, 95% CI, 
0.37 to 0.89; P 
= 
0.04 for the treatment-by-region 
interaction). The corresponding baseline 10-year 
risk of major osteoporotic fracture, as assessed 
by the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX; 
developed by the World Health Organization 
[www

ica and 17.0% elsewhere.
24-Month Fracture Efficacy
All the patients made the transition to denosu-
mab in the second year. The cumulative 24-month 
incidence of new vertebral fracture was lower in 
the group that had originally received romosoz-

month 9, P = 0.95; month 12, P = 0.006; month 18, 
P = 0.74; and month 24, P = 0.81. For the comparisons 
of the mean percentage change from baseline in β-CTX 
levels: P<0.001 for the comparisons at 14 days and at 
months 1, 6 plus 14 days, 9, and 12; and at month 3, 
P = 0.25; month 3 plus 14 days, P = 0.005; month 6, 
P = 0.08; month 13, P = 0.82; month 18, P = 0.06; and 
month 24, P = 0.04. For P1NP and β-CTX levels, the 
comparisons were calculated with the use of the Wilcox-
on rank-sum test.

significant difference in the risk of clinical frac-
ture between the group that had originally re-
ceived romosozumab and the group that had 
originally received placebo (99 patients and 147 
patients, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 
0.52 to 0.87; nominal P

0.002; adjusted P 
=

(Fig. 2B). Details are provided in Table S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
Bone Density and Markers of Bone Turnover
Romosozumab increased bone mineral density 
by 6 months, and at 12 months the percentage 
change from baseline was greater with romosoz-
umab than with placebo at the lumbar spine, by 
13.3 percentage points (95% CI, 11.9 to 14.7), at 
the total hip, by 6.9 percentage points (95% CI, 
5.6 to 8.1), and at the femoral neck, by 5.9 per-
centage points (95% CI, 4.3 to 7.4) (P<0.001 for 
all comparisons) (Fig. 3A, 3B, and 3C). Bone 
mineral density continued to increase in the ro-
mosozumab group after the transition to denos-
umab (P<0.001 for all comparisons between the 
group that had originally received romosozumab 
and the group that had originally received pla-
cebo) (Fig. 3A, 3B, and 3C).
The levels of the bone-formation marker 
P1NP increased rapidly in the romosozumab 
group (maximum peak on day 14) and returned 
to baseline levels by 9 months. The levels of the 
bone-resorption marker β-CTX decreased early 
during treatment (maximum decline on day 14) 
and remained below the levels in the placebo 
group at 12 months (Fig. 3D and 3E). At pre-
specified time points when the levels were also 
measured 14 days after dosing of romosozumab 
or placebo, transient increases in the P1NP level 
and decreases in the β-CTX level in the romosoz-
umab group were observed. Denosumab treat-
ment reduced the levels of P1NP and β-CTX 
similarly in each group.
Adverse Events and Safety
The incidence of adverse events and serious ad-
verse events was balanced in the two groups, as 
was the incidence of events that were catego-
rized as osteoarthritis, hyperostosis, cancer, hy-
persensitivity, and adjudicated serious cardiovas-
cular events (Table 2). Serious adverse events 
that were potentially indicative of hypersensitiv-
ity occurred in 7 patients in the romosozumab 
group in the first year. Injection-site reactions, 
which were mostly mild in severity, were re-
ported over the 12-month period in 187 patients 
(5.2%) in the romosozumab group and in 104 
(2.9%) in the placebo group.
Two events that occurred in patients in the 
romosozumab group were adjudicated as being 
consistent with the definition of osteonecrosis 
of the jaw. One event occurred after 12 months 
of romosozumab treatment in the context of ill-
fitting dentures, and the other event occurred 
after 12 months of romosozumab treatment and 
one dose of denosumab after a tooth extraction 
and subsequent osteomyelitis of the jaw. One 
event that was adjudicated as being consistent 
with the definition of atypical femoral fracture 
occurred 3.5 months after the first dose of romo-
sozumab; the patient had reported a history of 
prodromal pain at the site of fracture beginning 
before enrollment.
During the first 15 months of the trial, bind-
ing anti-romosozumab antibodies developed in 
646 patients in the romosozumab group (18.0%), 
and neutralizing antibodies developed in 25 pa-
tients in the romosozumab group (0.7%), with no 
detectable effect on efficacy or safety (Tables S4 
and S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
median albumin-corrected serum calcium levels 
were lower at 1 month in the romosozumab 
group than in the placebo group (median change 
from baseline, −2.2% vs. 0.0%).
Discussion
In this phase 3 trial involving patients with os-
teoporosis, romosozumab was associated with a 
lower risk of new vertebral fractures than pla-
cebo at 12 months. The effect of romosozumab 
on the risk of vertebral fracture was rapid, with 
only 2 additional vertebral fractures (of a total of 
16 such fractures in the romosozumab group) 
occurring in the second 6 months of therapy. 
The risk of clinical fracture (a composite of non-
vertebral fracture and symptomatic vertebral frac-
ture) was also significantly lower in the romosoz-
umab group within 12 months after the start of 
treatment than in the placebo group. Because 
vertebral and clinical fractures are associated 
with increased morbidity and considerable health 
care costs,16-18 a treatment that would reduce this 
risk rapidly could offer appropriate patients an 
important benefit.

Romosozumab in Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis
Although all patients made the transition to 
denosumab in the second year of the trial, the 
risk of fracture was lower in the group that had 
received romosozumab in the first year than in 
the group that had received placebo. Fewer addi-
tional vertebral fractures occurred in the second 
year in patients who had been originally as-
signed to romosozumab than in those who had 
been originally assigned to placebo (5 vs. 25 frac-
tures) — a pattern that was also observed across 
other fracture types. These findings imply that 
romosozumab was associated with a lower un-
derlying fracture risk even after the transition to 
denosumab.
In the trial population, the rate of nonverte-
bral fracture in the placebo group was lower 
than expected, which was driven by a geo-
graphic region with high enrollment (Latin

America) in which the incidence in the placebo 
group at 12 months was one third the expected 
rate, with no detectable treatment effect. The 
regional-subgroup data warrant cautious inter-
pretation owing to a lack of adjustment for 
multiple comparisons and the possibility of 
type I error. However, the low rate of nonverte-
bral fracture in the placebo group in the Latin 
American geographic region is consistent with 
the low mean baseline FRAX score that was 
observed in the patients enrolled in that region 
and with recent epidemiologic reports.19,20 In a 
post hoc analysis that included patients outside 
Latin America, a higher rate of nonvertebral 
fracture was observed in the placebo group 
(2.7%, vs. 1.2% in the placebo group in Latin 
America), and 12 months of romosozumab 
treatment resulted in a risk of fracture that was 
42% lower than the risk with placebo. These 
findings merit further evaluation.
The results regarding bone-turnover markers 
confirm those reported previously10 and support 
the dual effect of romosozumab in increasing 
bone formation and decreasing bone resorp-
tion by means of sclerostin inhibition. Sclerostin 
blocks canonical Wnt signaling, which results in 
decreased osteoblast-mediated bone formation21,22 
and increased bone resorption,23 both of which 
are counteracted by romosozumab.11,24 The tran-
sient increases in the P1NP level after repeated 
dosing may provide insight into the observed 
gains in bone mineral density over the treatment 
period. This effect of romosozumab on bone 
formation and resorption translated into large 
increases in bone mineral density at the spine 
and hip, and clinically significant increases were 
seen as early as 6 months, as reported previ-
ously.10 Additional gains were observed after the 
transition to denosumab.
Adverse events were balanced in the two 
groups. Serious adverse events of hypersensitiv-
ity reactions were observed in the romosozumab 
group, although these events were uncommon. 
Cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw and an atypical 
femoral fracture were observed, albeit rarely, in 
patients with confounding factors that may have 
contributed to the event or that raise questions 
about causality.
In conclusion, romosozumab is a monoclonal 
antibody that increases bone formation and de-
creases bone resorption. One year of romosozu-
mab treatment in postmenopausal women with 
osteoporosis resulted in a lower risk of vertebral 
and clinical fractures than the risk with placebo. 
Substantial gains in bone mineral density at the 
spine and hip with romosozumab provided a 
foundation for an ongoing reduction in the risk 
of fracture during sequential treatment with 
denosumab.
