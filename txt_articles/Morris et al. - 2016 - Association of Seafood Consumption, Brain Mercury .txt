IMPORTANCE Seafood consumption is promoted for its many health benefits even though its
contamination by mercury, a known neurotoxin, is a growing concern.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether seafood consumption is correlated with increased brain
mercury levels and also whether seafood consumption or brain mercury levels are correlated
with brain neuropathologies.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional analyses of deceased participants
in the Memory and Aging Project clinical neuropathological cohort study, 2004-2013.
Participants resided in Chicago retirement communities and subsidized housing. The study
included 286 autopsied brains of 554 deceased participants (51.6%). The mean (SD) age at
death was 89.9 (6.1) years, 67% (193) were women, and the mean (SD) educational
attainment was 14.6 (2.7) years.
EXPOSURES Seafood intake was first measured by a food frequency questionnaire
at a mean of 4.5 years before death.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Dementia-related pathologies assessed were Alzheimer
disease, Lewy bodies, and the number of macroinfarcts and microinfarcts. Dietary
consumption of seafood and n-3 fatty acids was annually assessed by a food frequency
questionnaire in the years before death. Tissue concentrations of mercury and selenium were
measured using instrumental neutron activation analyses.
RESULTS Among the 286 autopsied brains of 544 participants, brain mercury levels were
positively correlated with the number of seafood meals consumed per week (ρ = 0.16;
P = .02). In models adjusted for age, sex, education, and total energy intake, seafood
consumption (� 1 meal[s]/week) was significantly correlated with less Alzheimer disease
pathology including lower density of neuritic plaques (β = −0.69 score units [95% CI, −1.34 to
−0.04]), less severe and widespread neurofibrillary tangles (β = −0.77 score units [95% CI,
−1.52 to −0.02]), and lower neuropathologically defined Alzheimer disease (β = −0.53 score
units [95% CI, −0.96 to −0.10]) but only among apolipoprotein E (APOE ε4) carriers. Higher
intake levels of α-linolenic acid (18:3 n-3) were correlated with lower odds of cerebral
macroinfarctions (odds ratio for tertiles 3 vs 1, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.27 to 0.94]). Fish oil
supplementation had no statistically significant correlation with any neuropathologic marker.
Higher brain concentrations of mercury were not significantly correlated with increased levels
of brain neuropathology.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In cross-sectional analyses, moderate seafood consumption
was correlated with lesser Alzheimer disease neuropathology. Although seafood
consumption was also correlated with higher brain levels of mercury, these levels were not
correlated with brain neuropathology.

N
umerous studies have found protective associations
between seafood consumption and dementia.1-7
Little is known about the relationship between sea-
food consumption and brain neuropathology. Seafood is high
in the long-chain n-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA),
which has established properties for normal neuronal
function.8,9 However, seafood is also a source of mercury, a
neurotoxin that impairs neurocognitive development.10
Mercury toxicity is reduced by selenium, an essential nutri-
ent present in seafood that has high binding affinity to
mercury.11 In this study, we examined the associations of
dementia neuropathologies with dietary n-3 fatty acids and
with brain levels of mercury and selenium.
Methods
Study Population
The analytic sample comprised autopsied cases of deceased
participants in the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) who
died between November 2004 and November 2013 and who
completed a dietary assessment before death. MAP is an on-
going clinical-neuropathological cohort study of older adults
that began in 1997 and includes Chicago residents of retire-
ment communities and subsidized housing.12 At enrollment,
participants were dementia free and agreed to undergo an-
nual clinical neurological evaluations and brain autopsy at
death. Annual dietary assessments of MAP participants be-
gan in February 2004. Written informed consent was ob-
tained from all study participants, and the study was ap-
proved by the institutional review board of Rush University.
Brain Neuropathology
The methods for brain autopsies and pathologic evaluations
are described in detail elsewhere.13 Briefly, slabs from 1 cere-
bral hemisphere were placed in a −80°C freezer and used for
metal analyses. Slabs from the contralateral hemisphere were
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and then dissected tissue
samples from brain regions were embedded in paraffin
blocks, cut into 6-micron sections, and mounted onto slides.
Alzheimer disease neuropathologies, including diffuse and
neuritic amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, were
identified using modified Bielschowsky silver-stained
6-micron sections in multiple cortical regions. Raw counts
(greatest density in 1-mm2 area) of the neuritic and diffuse
plaques and tangles were standardized in each region and
averaged across regions to create 3 summary scores that were
then averaged for a global measure of Alzheimer disease
pathology. We also analyzed 2 semiquantitative measures of
Alzheimer disease pathology: CERAD (Consortium to Estab-
lish a Registry for Alzheimer Disease; [for neuritic plaque
density])14 and Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage.15 CERAD
scores ranged from 1 (no neuritic plaques) to 4 (frequent neu-
ritic plaques). Braak staging scores ranged from 0 (no tangles
in any region) to 6 (frequent tangles across multiple regions).
Another variable described the level of Alzheimer disease
pathology based on National Institute on Aging (NIA) and
the Ronald and Nancy Reagan Research Institute of the
Alzheimer’
s Association criteria16 with scores ranging from 1
(low Alzheimer disease pathology) to 4 (high Alzheimer dis-
ease pathology). A board-certified neuropathologist, blinded
to participant ages and clinical data, determined the neuro-
pathology diagnoses.
Counts of chronic macroscopic cerebral infarctions and
microinfarcts were made as previously described.17 Macro-
infarcts were identified through visual inspection and were
histologically confirmed. Multiple regions were examined
for microinfarcts using hematoxylin and eosin stain.
Lewybodystagingwasassessedin6regionsthroughstain-
ing with antibodies to α-synuclein.13,18
Mercury and Selenium Analyses
Brain metal concentrations were measured in 2 cortical
regions (inferior temporal and midfrontal) involved in
Alzheimer disease neuropathology and the cerebellum
(a region unaffected by Alzheimer disease neuropathology)
to facilitate the interpretation of study findings. Brain tis-
sue was cut into 100-g samples using a ceramic blade (to
avoid metal contamination) and sent to the University of
Missouri Research Reactor to be assessed for selenium and
mercury by instrumental neutron activation analysis.19
Samples were loaded into cleaned, high-purity quartz vials,
lyophilized, and then irradiated for 50 hours in a neutron flux
of 6.5 × 1013 n/cm2∙s and allowed to decay for 20 to 40 days
before being counted using a high-purity germanium detec-
tor system. Measured concentrations of the metals in refer-
ence materials were analyzed for consistency with accepted
standards and agreed well with certified values. For analyses,
we first transformed (log10) the highly skewed metal concen-
trations and then computed z scores of these values for each
brain region. Mean z scores for each region were then aver-
aged across the 2 cortical regions and across all 3 regions.
Dietary Consumption
Dietary intake was assessed by a semiquantitative food fre-
quency questionnaire that was validated for use in older
Chicago residents.20 The questionnaire included 4 seafood
items (tuna sandwich; fish sticks, cakes, or sandwich; fresh
fish as a main dish; and shrimp, lobster, or crab) that were
used to compute weekly seafood consumption. Daily intakes
of long-chain n-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA,
20:5 n-3] + DHA [22:6 n-3]) and α-linolenic acid (18:3 n-3)
were obtained by multiplying the nutrient content of all food
items by frequency of consumption and summing over all
items. Nutrient intakes were energy adjusted by the regres-
sion residual method.21 The questionnaire also included a
query about intake of fish oil supplements. Dietary intake
levels were averaged over all valid food frequency question-
naires obtained during the years before death. Evaluators of
neuropathological measures and brain concentrations of
metals were blinded to dietary intake data.
Statistical Methods
We used linear regression models to investigate the associa-
tions of the dietary variables and brain metal concentrations
with Alzheimer disease neuropathology (general Alzheimer

disease pathology [log transformed] and CERAD, Braak, and
NIA and Reagan Institute scores). We examined the diet/
metal associations with Lewy bodies, macroinfarcts, and
microinfarcts in logistic regression models with outcomes
modeled present or absent because of the highly skewed dis-
tributions. Model assumptions were investigated graphically
and statistically, and findings were confirmed through
reanalyses using proportional hazards models. Analyses were
conducted using SAS version 9.3. Models were adjusted for
established predictors of neuropathology including age at
death, sex, and education, and for the seafood model only,
adjustment was made for total energy intake (kcal/d). Statis-
tical interactions were tested in adjusted models with a mul-
tiplicative term between the diet/metal variable and the
potential effect modifier. The level of statistical significance
for all tests, including those for interactions, was 2-sided
(P ≤ .05). We investigated both linear and nonlinear correla-
tions of the diet and metal exposures to neuropathologic out-
comes. Consistent with previous studies,1,3,5,7,22 seafood con-
sumption was not linearly correlated with the Alzheimer
disease outcomes, and only the findings with seafood mod-
eled as an indicator variable (≥1 meal[s] per week vs less) are
presented. To make the data presentation succinct, we pre-
sent only the linear model coefficients for analyses stratified
by apolipoprotein E (APOE ε4). We examined the associa-
tions of brain metal concentrations to neuropathologic out-
comes with the z score metal concentrations averaged over
the 2 cortical regions and also the cortical and cerebellum
regions. Because the findings were similar, we present aver-
aged concentrations from the 3 brain regions.
Results
The study was conducted among 286 MAP participants who
completed a dietary assessment, died between November
2004 and 2013 (n = 554), and had a brain autopsy per-
formed (n = 447); thus representing 51.6% of all deceased
MAP participants. The mean (SD) postmortem time interval
was 8.3 (7.4) hours. Of the analyzed sample, 43.7% (125)
completed 1 food frequency questionnaire, 20.3% (58) com-
pleted 2, and 36% (103) completed 3 or more. The correla-
tion between the reported number of seafood meals con-
sumed at the first and last obtained food frequency
questionnaires was the Spearman rank-order correrelation
coeffecient (ρ = 0.57; P < .001). The mean time interval
between administration of the first questionnaire and death
was 4.5 years, and there were 2.4 years between the last
questionnaire and death. Participants were coded as fish oil
supplement users if they reported taking the supplements
in at least 1 dietary assessment (n = 49); most (n = 31)
reported use at only 1 visit.
The analytic sample had a mean (SD) age of 89.9 (6.1)
years at death, was largely composed of women (67%;
n=193), had mean (SD) educational attainment of 14.6 (2.7)
years, and 22.7% (65) were positive for the APOE ε4 allele.
These characteristics were comparable with those of the total
number of deceased participants (89.2 [6.2] years at death,
68% were women, 14.2 [3.0] years of education, and 23.6%
were APOE ε4 positive). These and other characteristics were
similar over the tertiles of dietary n-3 fatty acid intake levels
with the exception that participants in the highest tertile of
intake were more likely to be women and those in the lowest
tertile more likely to be APOE ε4 positive (Table 1). Partici-
pants in the lowest n-3 fatty acid tertile also had somewhat
higher levels of neuropathology.
Thesubsampleof203autopsiedcasesforwhichbraincon-
centrations of metals were analyzed had similar characteris-
tics to the larger sample (Table 1). Brains of participants in the
highest tertile of mercury concentrations were more likely to
be older at death, to be women, and to have lower levels of
global Alzheimer disease neuropathology and higher brain se-
lenium concentrations.
Mean (SD) levels for brain mercury concentrations were
0.26 (0.87) μg/g in the midfrontal region, 0.25 (0.78) μg/g
in the inferior temporal region, and 0.87 (1.80) μg/g in
the cerebellum The levels were correlated across regions
(Spearman ρ, 0.65 to 0.76 [P < .001]). Brain selenium con-
centrations were comparable across the brain regions
(Table 2). Brain cortical mercury levels were positively cor-
related with cortical selenium levels (ρ, 0.35 [P < .001]) and
with the number of seafood meals consumed per week
(ρ, 0.16 [P = .02]).
Brain Neuropathology and Dietary n-3 Fatty Acids
We first analyzed the data in the entire sample of 286
deceased participants. Dietary intake of α-linolenic acid was
correlated with decreased odds of cerebral macroinfarcts and
microinfarcts in models adjusted for age at death, sex, and
education but was not correlated with other neuropathologi-
cal markers (Table 3). Dietary intake of long-chain n-3 fatty
acids had a nonlinear correlation with cerebral macroinfarcts
in the adjusted model but was not correlated with microin-
farcts or other neuropathologic markers. Seafood consump-
tion and fish oil supplement use were not correlated with any
brain neuropathology in the total sample.
Based on observed statistical interactions between APOE
ε4 genotype and seafood or n-3 fatty acid intakes on cogni-
tive decline in previous studies,23-30 we investigated this
potential effect modification on brain neuropathology. We
observed significant interactions with APOE ε4 status and
dietary intakes of seafood and long-chain n-3 fatty acids on
every measure of Alzheimer disease neuropathology
(all P ≤ .04) except for n-3 fatty acids and neurofibrillary
tangle severity (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Tests for inter-
action effects between APOE ε4 and either α-linolenic acid or
fish oil supplement use on the neuropathologic outcomes did
not reach the significance threshold (P > .25), with the excep-
tion of macroinfarcts (P for interaction = .05) for which fish
oil supplement use was correlated with lower risk in APOE ε4
carriers.
Further analyses examined correlations between the
dietary variables and brain neuropathology stratified by
APOE ε4 status (Table 4). Individuals who were APOE ε4
positive and consumed at least 1 seafood meal per week or
had higher intakes of long-chain n-3 fatty acids had less

Alzheimer disease neuropathology compared with those
who consumed lower amounts. For example, among the
APOE ε4 carriers who consumed seafood weekly, the likeli-
hood score for Alzheimer disease was lower by 0.53 score
units (Table 4). By contrast, there was no correlation
between seafood consumption and neuropathology among
those who were APOE ε4 negative. There were no material

for vegetable consumption except that the correlation

Alzheimer disease diagnosis. The β-coefficients increased
in magnitude and remained statistically significant be-
tween seafood consumption and global Alzheimer disease
pathology (β, −0.88 score units [95% CI, −1.74 to −0.02])
and neuritic plaques (β, −0.83 score units [95% CI,
−1.56 to −0.10]), were unchanged for Alzheimer disease
diagnostic score (β, −0.53 score units [95% CI, −0.99 to
−0.07]), and no longer statistically significant for neurofi-
brillary tangle severity (β, −0.73 score units [95% CI, −1.54
to 0.08]).
Brain Neuropathology and Brain Metal Concentrations
In further analyses, we examined whether brain concentra-
tions of the neurotoxin mercury or the antioxidant trace ele-
ment selenium were correlated with brain neuropathology
in separate models adjusted for age at death, sex, education,
and seafood consumption (Table 5; eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment). There was no significant correlation between brain
mercury levels and Alzheimer disease neuropathology.
Brain mercury levels were significantly correlated with
lower odds of macroinfarcts and microinfarcts. Brain sele-
nium levels were not correlated with the neuropathologic
markers except for neurofibrillary tangle severity in which
higher selenium levels were correlated with higher tangle
severity. Tests for statistical interaction by APOE ε4 status
on the brain metals and neuropathology did not reach sta-
tistical significance (P > .26).
We also investigated the possibility of statistical interac-
tion between brain concentrations of mercury and selenium
(an antagonist to mercury toxicity) on the neuropathologic
markers.31 Tests for interaction between these 2 biometals
on brain neuropathologies in the adjusted models did not
reach statistical significance (P > .14).
Discussion
In this cross-sectional study of older Midwestern residents,
weekly consumption of seafood and dietary intake of
long-chain n-3 fatty acids were inversely correlated
with Alzheimer disease neuropathology but only among
APOE ε4 carriers. Dietary intakes of seafood and long-chain
n-3 fatty acids were not correlated with brain infarcts or
with Lewy bodies. Higher intake of α-linolenic acid, the
shorter-chain n-3 fatty acid found in plants, was correlated
with decreased risk of cerebral infarcts; however, there
was no evidence of effect modification by APOE ε4 status.
Although seafood consumption was correlated with

higher brain levels of mercury, the higher mercury levels
were not significantly correlated with increased brain
neuropathology.
In a large epidemiological study of middle-aged Dutch
adults, dietary α-linolenic acid was associated with 35% to
50% reduction in incident strokes.32 A large number of epi-
demiological studies reported protective relations between
seafood consumption and n-3 fatty acids with cognitive
decline22,27,33-37 and incident dementia.1-5,7 Of those that
investigated effect modification by APOE ε4 status, the
findings are inconsistent. Some reported protective associa-
tions with APOE ε4 carriers,5,25 others with APOE ε4
noncarriers,2,27 and still others with no effect modification
by APOE ε4.35,38,39 Of 3 randomized controlled trials of fish
oil supplementation, 2 observed positive effects on cogni-
tive change in healthy older adults who were APOE ε4
carriers,28,29 and the third observed positive effects in Alz-
heimer disease patients who were APOE ε4 noncarriers.24
We did not observe a correlation between fish oil supple-
ment use and brain neuropathology although use was very
limited and not consistent over time. DHA, the primary
lipid in the brain, decreases with age as a result of lipid
peroxidation.40 DHA metabolism may be affected by a host
of factors including age, APOE genotype, body mass index,
sex, and alcohol consumption, which may explain the
inconsistencies across studies.41
Protection against Alzheimer disease neuropathology
from dietary n-3 fatty acids in APOE ε4 carriers was also
reported in an animal study that measured the effects of a
fish oil diet vs control diet in APOE ε4- and APOE ε3-targeted
mice.42 The study demonstrated the APOE ε4 phenotype of
increased Aβ42 (the abnormal protein characteristic of Alzhei-
mer disease pathology), impaired synaptic function, and
decreased learning and memory, and that these were pre-
vented by a fish oil diet.42
To our knowledge, this is the first study to report on the
relationship between brain concentrations of mercury and
brainneuropathologyordiet.Thefindingofnodeleteriouscor-
relations of mercury on the brain is supported by a number of
case-control studies that found no difference between
Alzheimer disease patients and controls in mercury concen-
trations in the brain,19,43,44 serum,45or whole blood.46 A cross-
sectional population study observed no association between
blood concentrations of mercury and cognitive test scores.47
In the MAP study, brain mercury levels trended in the protec-
tive direction with the neuropathologic markers. One cohort
study reported a statistically significant inverse association be-
tween blood mercury levels and incident Alzheimer disease.38
There is a vast literature on the benefits of n-3 fatty
acids on neurocognitive development.48 One study found
that the cognitive benefits in early childhood associated
with maternal fish consumption in utero were offset by
higher erythrocyte mercury levels in the mothers.10,48 We
did not observe a similar interaction between mercury and
seafood consumption on brain health in the aged brain.
The study findings were from a cohort of individuals
initially free of dementia who were observed until death.
The design minimizes the chance of selection bias that
occurs in case-control studies. It also provides a wide spec-
trum of disease pathology from which to observe associa-
tions with environmental exposures. The comparatively
large number of brains analyzed decreases the likelihood
that the findings are due to chance and increased our ability
to observe modifications in the correlations by APOE ε4 sta-
tus. Nevertheless, insufficient statistical power may have
prevented detection of small correlations of n-3 fatty acids
on neuropathology in APOE ε4 noncarriers. Other strengths
of the study include the validated and/or standardized mea-
surements of diet, metal concentrations, and neuropatho-
logical measures. The measurements were based on aver-
aged assessments over multiple years (diet) and brain
regions (metal concentrations and neuropathologies), which
help to minimize bias due to measurement error.
A major limitation of the study is the observational
study design, which precludes causal interpretation of the
data. In addition, the measurement of brain pathologies and
mercury levels at the time of death prevents the assessment
of temporality in relation to dietary intake levels. This limi-
tation is mitigated by our finding in a previous study that
weekly seafood consumption was associated with slower
cognitive decline over a mean 4.9 years among 915 MAP
participants.49 Another limitation of the study is the subjec-
tive measure of dietary intake, although the dietary tool was
validated in older adults.20,50 Further testament to the
validity of the diet assessment is the positive correlation
between brain mercury concentrations and seafood con-
sumption. Another study limitation is that only half of the
deceased MAP participants had both autopsy and dietary
intake data for analyses. Concerns of sample bias are allayed
by the fact that the analyzed sample was comparable with
all deceased participants in age, sex, education, and APOE
ε4 status. Seafood intake in the MAP study population was
moderate, and therefore the findings cannot be generalized
to populations with higher seafood consumption or with
high mercury exposure. It is likely that types of fish con-
sumed in this study reflect the top 10 consumed species in
the United States, which have low-to-moderate levels of
mercury.51 Nevertheless, the levels of mercury in the MAP
study population were comparable with levels previously
reported for cortical brain regions.19
The study findings were from a very old, largely
non-Hispanic white cohort and may not be generalizable to
younger adults or other racial or ethnic groups.12 Brain con-
centrations of DHA decrease with older age because of lipid
peroxidation,52 which is higher among APOE ε4 carriers.53
Thus, fish consumption may be more beneficial with older age.
Conclusions
In cross-sectional analyses, moderate seafood consumption
was correlated with lesser burden of brain Alzheimer
disease neuropathology in APOE ε4 carriers. Although
seafood consumption was correlated with higher brain lev-
els of mercury, these levels were not correlated with brain
neuropathology.
