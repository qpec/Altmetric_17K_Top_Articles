SUMMARY
Recent epidemics of Zika virus (ZIKV) have been asso-
ciatedwith congenitalmalformationduring pregnancy
and Guillain-Barre
´ syndrome. There are two ZIKV line-
ages (African and Asian) that share >95% amino acid
identity. Little is known regarding the ability of neutral-
izing antibodies elicited against one lineage to protect
against the other. We investigated the breadth of the
neutralizing antibody response following ZIKV infec-
tion by measuring the sensitivity of six ZIKV strains
to neutralization by ZIKV-confirmed convalescent hu-
man serum or plasma samples. Contemporary Asian
and early African ZIKV strains were similarly sensitive
to neutralization regardless of the cellular source of
virus. Furthermore, mouse immune serum generated
after infection with African or Asian ZIKV strains was
capable of neutralizing homologous and heterolo-
gous ZIKV strains equivalently. Because our study
only defines a single ZIKV serotype, vaccine candi-
dates

neutralizing
antibody

sponsesshould inhibit infection of both ZIKV lineages,
including strains circulating in the Americas.
INTRODUCTION
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that has
emerged from relative obscurity to cause an epidemic of great
public health concern. During the half-century that followed its
discovery, ZIKV was rarely linked to disease in humans, despite
considerable transmission (Dick, 1953; Petersen et al., 2016).
The emergence of epidemic ZIKV was first reported in Yap island
in 2007, followed by outbreaks in French Polynesia in 2013 and
2014 and regularly thereafter in other islands of the Pacific.
ZIKV was introduced into the western hemisphere in 2014–
2015 and spread rapidly to 40 or more countries and territories.
Historically,
symptomatic
ZIKV
infection
of
humans
was
described as a self-limiting mild febrile illness associated with
rash, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis (Petersen et al., 2016). How-
ever, recent ZIKV infections also have been associated with
neurological complications, including Guillain-Barre
´ syndrome
and meningoencephalitis (Brasil et al., 2016a, 2016b; Cao-Lor-
meau et al., 2016; Oehler et al., 2014). Of greatest concern,
ZIKV infection is now linked causally to microcephaly and intra-
uterine growth retardation in the fetuses of women infected with
the virus while pregnant (Hazin et al., 2016).
Flaviviruses are spherical virus particles that incorporate two
structural proteins, premembrane/membrane (prM/M) and enve-
lope (E), into their lipid envelope. High-resolution structures of the
mature ZIKV virion and ectodomain of the E protein have been
solved (Dai et al., 2016; Kostyuchenko et al., 2016; Sirohi et al.,
2016). Similar to other flaviviruses, mature ZIKV virions are rela-
tively smooth particles that incorporate 180 copies each of the
E and M proteins. Neutralizing antibodies play a critical role in
protection against flaviviruses and bind epitopes located in all
three E protein structural domains (Heinz and Stiasny, 2012).
Additionally, potently neutralizing flavivirus antibodies have
been isolated that bind surfaces composed of more than one
domain or E protein (Screaton et al., 2015). Because neutralizing
antibody titers correlate with protection by licensed vaccines for
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and
tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) (Belmusto-Worn et al.,
2005; Heinz et al., 2007; Mason et al., 1973; Monath et al.,
2002), eliciting neutralizing antibodies is a desired feature of
candidate vaccines for related flaviviruses, including ZIKV.
Flaviviruses circulate as genetically distinct genotypes or line-
ages. ZIKV strains have been grouped into two lineages, African
and Asian, which differ by <5% at the amino-acid level, including
within the E protein gene (Haddow et al., 2012). The African line-
age includes the historical MR-766 strain originally identified
in 1947, whereas virus strains from the Asian lineage have
been implicated in the recent outbreaks in Yap, French Polyne-
sia, and the Americas. Understanding how sequence variation
among ZIKV strains impacts antibody recognition is of particular
importance to vaccine development. DENV, for example, circu-
lates as four distinct serotypes that differ by 25%–40% at the

 amino acid level within the E protein. The challenges of eliciting a
protective neutralizing antibody response against all four DENV
serotypes have delayed vaccine development significantly
(Guy et al., 2016). Desirable ZIKV vaccine candidates should
provide equivalent protection against both Asian and African
lineages.
In this study, we investigated the breadth of the humoral im-
mune response elicited by ZIKV infection. The ability of eight
convalescent ZIKV-immune human serum or plasma samples
collected during the current outbreak to neutralize multiple
ZIKV strains was evaluated. Our results demonstrate that
antibodies elicited after infection with contemporary Asian line-
age strains potently inhibit infection of both homologous Asian
and heterologous African strains. Similarly, immune sera from
mice infected with either Asian or African lineages inhibited
infection of homologous and heterologous ZIKV strains. Our
studies indicate that the different lineages of ZIKV exist as a
single serotype. These findings will be of particular importance
in the ongoing effort to rapidly develop a ZIKV vaccine.
RESULTS
Broadly Neutralizing Activity of ZIKV-Immune Sera
To evaluate the breadth of the neutralizing antibody response eli-
cited by ZIKV infection, sera or plasma were obtained from eight
ZIKV-infected individuals (Table S1). We first evaluated the
neutralization activity of each sample with Vero-cell-derived
stocks of three different ZIKV strains representing both African
and Asian lineages. The African lineage strain MR-766 used in
this study was originally isolated in Uganda in 1947. Contempo-
rary Asian lineage isolates were collected during the 2013 French
Polynesian outbreak (H/PF/2013) (Baronti et al., 2014) and the
recent Brazilian epidemic (Paraiba/2015). Amino acid variation
among viruses is detailed in Tables S2 and S3. Dose-dependent
inhibition curves with virus and human-immune sera and plasma
were generated using Raji cells expressing DC-SIGNR. Neutral-
ization curves of all three viruses revealed a similar profile with
serum from subject NIH.1 (Figure 1A). The EC50 values from in-
dependent neutralization studies for serum NIH.1 (Figure 1B)
Figure 1. Neutralization of Multiple Strains of Infectious ZIKV by Immune Human Sera
The sensitivity of three ZIKV strains to neutralization by sera from ZIKV-infected individuals was compared. Stocks of MR-766, H/PF/2013, and Paraiba/2015
ZIKV strains were produced in Vero cells and used in neutralization experiments. ZIKV was mixed with serial 4-fold dilutions of serum for 1 hr at 37�C prior to being
added to Raji-DCSIGNR cells. Infection was measured 20 hr post-infection by staining cells for intracellular E protein expression followed by flow cytometry. The
dilution of sera at half-maximal neutralization of infection (EC50) was estimated by non-linear regression analysis.
(A) Neutralization curves for a representative experiment are shown for serum NIH.1. Error bars represent the range of duplicate technical replicates.

reflect the range or SE of two to three experiments. Statistical differences in mean EC50 were identified using ANOVA with a multiple comparisons correction; the
fold difference in sensitivity relative to MR-766 and multiplicity-adjusted p values are displayed when significant (only F).

Cell Reports 16, 1485–1491, August 9, 2016
 and seven additional ZIKV convalescent samples (Figures 1C–1I)
confirmed that all three ZIKV strains were similarly sensitive to in-
hibition by sera or plasma derived from individuals infected with
contemporary ZIKV strains. Differences in the mean neutraliza-
tion titer were uniformly less than 4-fold and, with one exception
(Figure 1F), failed to reach statistical significance.
The efficiency of the virion maturation process varies among
cell types used to produce viruses. For example, flaviviruses
grown in insect cells are less efficiently processed than mamma-
lian cell-derived viruses (Dejnirattisai et al., 2015; Vogt et al.,
2011). For many antibodies, inefficient cleavage of the prM
structural protein results in increased neutralization potency
due to enhanced accessibility of epitopes on partially mature vi-
rions (Pierson and Diamond, 2012). The prM content of virions
also contributes to cell-type-dependent patterns of antibody
neutralization (Mukherjee et al., 2014a). To determine whether
the cellular substrate used for virus production impacts neutral-
ization sensitivity among the ZIKV strains studied, we repeated
neutralization studies with viruses produced in C6/36 insect
cells (Figure 2). When assayed on Raji-DCSIGNR cells, neutral-
ization titers obtained with these insect cell-derived stocks were
similar among different ZIKV strains (Figures 2A and 2C) and to
titers obtained with the same virus strains propagated in Vero
cells (Figures 1B and 1C). The effect of using Vero cells as tar-
gets in neutralization assays also was evaluated and found to
be minimal; the EC50 values were virtually unchanged in com-
parison to experiments performed with Raji-DCSIGNR cells (Fig-
ures 2B and 2D versus 2A and 2C, respectively). Taken together,
these data suggest that the similar sensitivity of multiple ZIKV
strains to serum neutralization was not dependent on assay
format.

The sensitivity of ZIKV strains MR-766, H/PF/2013,
and Paraiba/2015 produced in C6/36 insect cells
to neutralization by sera NIH.1 (A and B) and NIH.2
(C and D) was assessed. ZIKV was mixed with
serial 4-fold dilutions of serum for 1 hr at 37�C prior
to being added to Raji-DCSIGNR (A and C) or Vero
(B and D) cells. Infection was measured 20 hr post-
infection by staining cells for intracellular E pro-
tein expression followed by flow cytometry. The
dilution of sera at half-maximal neutralization of
infection (EC50) was estimated by non-linear
regression analysis. The average EC50 neutraliza-
tion titers obtained from independent neutraliza-
tion studies are presented. Error bars reflect the
range of two experiments. No statistical differ-
ences in mean EC50 were identified using ANOVA
with a multiple comparisons correction.
Neutralization of ZIKV Reporter
Virus Particles by Human Sera
Reporter
virus
particles
(RVPs)
are
pseudo-infectious flaviviruses produced
by complementation of a self-replicating
sub-genomic flavivirus RNA with the
structural genes provided in trans. We and others have used
RVPs extensively to study the functional properties of neutral-
izing monoclonal antibodies (Pierson et al., 2007; Shrestha
et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2016) and to evaluate the immunoge-
nicity of candidate flavivirus vaccines in humans (Martin et al.,
2007; VanBlargan et al., 2013). To confirm and extend the re-
sults of our studies with infectious ZIKV, we created RVPs that
incorporate the structural proteins of five ZIKV strains repre-
senting African (MR-766 and ArB7701) and Asian (H/PF/
2013, PHL/2012, and THA/2014) lineages. Studies with serum
from subject NIH.2 revealed all five RVPs were neutralized
equivalently (Figure 3A). More comprehensive studies were
performed with MR-766 and H/PF/2013 RVPs and the entire
panel of sera. The average EC50 neutralization titers for multi-
ple independent experiments are shown (Figures 3B–3I). These
data confirm studies with fully infectious virus, demonstrating
that strain-dependent differences in neutralization sensitivity
are small, if they are present at all. Furthermore, comparison
of the mean EC50 for all samples evaluated with both RVPs
and infectious virus revealed remarkable agreement (Fig-
ure S1). Limited studies with RVPs produced with the struc-
tural proteins of DENV and WNV revealed cross-reactive
neutralization

Analysis of ZIKV Strain-Dependent Neutralization in
Mice
Mice lacking key components of the type I interferon signaling
system have been defined as useful models of lethal ZIKV infec-
tion or in utero transmission (Aliota et al., 2016; Dowall et al.,
2016; Lazear et al., 2016; Miner et al., 2016; Rossi et al., 2016).
Cell Reports 16, 1485–1491, August 9, 2016
1487
 Because these systems may have value in preclinical vaccine
studies, we investigated whether mice, like humans, mount an
antibody response to ZIKV infection capable of equivalently
neutralizing multiple strains. Studies in mice additionally allowed
for assessment of the neutralizing activity of ZIKV-immune sera
without any possibility of prior flavivirus exposure or pre-existing
cross-immunity. Irf3�/� mice, which allow ZIKV replication yet
survive infection (Lazear et al., 2016), were infected with ZIKV
strains MR-766 or H/PF/2013. Sera were collected and evalu-
ated for neutralization using ZIKV RVPs displaying the homolo-
gous or heterologous structural proteins (Figures 4A and 4B).
Sera from mice infected with either Asian or African ZIKV strains
equivalently neutralized MR-766 and H/PF/2013 RVPs. These
data confirm the broadly neutralizing activity of ZIKV-immune
sera and suggest that strain selection or multi-antigen formula-
tions will not be a critical parameter for the design of a ZIKV vac-
cine as long as strongly neutralizing antibody responses are
elicited.
DISCUSSION
The rapid spread of ZIKV throughout South America and its link-
age to birth defects in infants born to women infected during
pregnancy has created a public health emergency that could
be mitigated by vaccination. Vaccines have proven effective at
blunting the impact of flavivirus infection on public health, most
notably for YFV. The antiviral activity of convalescent and vac-
cine-induced antibodies reflects their capacity to bind to and
neutralize virion infectivity, as well as mediate other effector
functions (Burton, 2002; Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2008).
Serum-neutralizing activity has proven to be a useful correlate
of protection following vaccination against the related flavivi-
ruses YFV, JEV, and TBEV. Phylogenetic analyses of ZIKV reveal
that African and Asian lineages share >95% identity in amino
acid sequences encoding the structural protein E targeted by
neutralizing antibodies (Haddow et al., 2012). How amino acid
variation among ZIKV strains impacts immunogenicity and

ZIKV RVPs were produced by complementation of a GFP-expressing WNV replicon with a plasmid encoding the structural proteins of ZIKV strains MR-766, H/PF/
2013, ArB7701, THA/2014, and PHL/2012. RVPs were mixed with serial 4-fold dilutions of serum for 1 hr at 37�C prior to being added to Raji-DCSIGNR cells. After
48 hr, GFP-positive infected cells were detected by flow cytometry. The dilution of sera at half-maximal neutralization of infection (EC50) was estimated by non-
linear regression analysis.

 whether all ZIKV strains are sensitive to neutralization by anti-
bodies elicited by heterologous antigens remained unknown.
In this study, we investigated the breadth of the neutralizing
antibody response elicited by natural infection with ZIKV. Conva-
lescent human sera or plasma obtained from individuals infected
during the recent ZIKV epidemic were tested for their ability
to neutralize infection of multiple strains of infectious ZIKV or
ZIKV RVPs. This panel of human-immune sera or plasma neutral-
ized contemporary Asian and historical African ZIKV strains
equivalently, which suggests that ZIKV circulates as a single
serotype. To extend these findings, we also investigated how
the infecting ZIKV strain impacted the specificity of neutralizing
antibodies. We demonstrate that mice infected with strain MR-
766 or H/PF/2013 produced antibodies that neutralized both
strains with equivalent potency. Our findings suggest antigens
produced from African lineage viruses, such as the inactivated
MR-766 vaccine candidate developed by Bharat Biotech, will
elicit antibodies capable of neutralizing contemporary circulating
strains.
Although the existence of a single serotype was suggested by
conservation of E protein sequences among ZIKV strains, fac-
tors that define the sensitivity of flaviviruses to neutralization
remain incompletely understood (Pierson and Diamond, 2015).
A recent study of the functional complexity of DENV vaccine-im-
mune sera demonstrated that changes at only two amino acids
were sufficient to render DENV1 and DENV2 RVPs equally sen-
sitive to neutralization by monovalent DENV1 immune sera (Van-
Blargan et al., 2013). These findings suggest the extent of amino
acid variability required for distinct viral serotypes cannot be pre-
dicted, and may be modest in number and dependent on viral
background, an area that merits further study (Katzelnick et al.,
2015). Beyond variation in amino acids in direct contact with
antibody molecules, E protein variation may impact both struc-
tural heterogeneity and conformational dynamics of the virus
particle, resulting in considerable changes to its overall antigenic
structure (Kuhn et al., 2015; Pierson and Diamond, 2012).
Although additional studies are required to obtain a detailed un-
derstanding of the antigenic structure of infectious ZIKV, our
data suggest that differences in sequence, structural heteroge-
neity or dynamics among ZIKV strains have a minimal impact
on sensitivity to the mixture of antibodies present in ZIKV-im-
mune sera from convalescent patients or mice.
Overall, our results define a single ZIKV serotype and suggest
that infection or vaccination with a single ZIKV strain can
elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies against multiple strains,
providing a direct path for the development of an effective
vaccine.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Clinical Samples
ZIKV convalescent sera or plasma were collected with informed consent at the
NIH Vaccine Research Center and the Hope Clinic of the Emory Vaccine Cen-
ter. Additional details and clinical protocol numbers related to the collection of
these samples are provided in Table S1 and the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
Reporter Virus Particle Production
RVPs were produced by complementation of a WNV replicon with the struc-
tural proteins of WNV, DENV, or ZIKV using previously described methods.
The ZIKV structural gene constructs described here were produced by cloning
C-prM-E sequences from infectious virus or gene synthesis as described in the
Supplemental Experimental Procedures as well as Tables S2 and S3.
Virus Neutralization Studies
Detailed protocols for neutralization studies with viruses and RVPs are pro-
vided in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Figures 1–3 and
have been described in detail recently (Mukherjee et al., 2014b). Serial dilu-
tions of sera or plasma were mixed with virus or RVPs and incubated for
1 hr at 37�C in order to ensure steady-state binding. Immune complexes
were added to cells and incubated for one or two days for infectious viruses
and RVPs, respectively. RVP infection was scored as a function of GFP
expression, whereas infectious virus detection was measured by intracellular
staining with an E-protein-specific mAb. The resulting data were analyzed by
non-linear regression to estimate the dilution of sera required to inhibit 50% of
infection. The lower limit at which neutralization could be measured with con-
fidence was determined to be a 1/60 dilution of sera based on experiments
with normal human sera collected prior to the ZIKV outbreak in South America
(n = 29).

with ZIKV Strains H/PF/2013 or MR-766
Irf3�/� mice were infected with 103 FFU of ZIKV strain MR-766 or H/PF/2013.
Neutralization studies with mouse sera and both H/PF/2013 and MR-766 RVPs
were performed as described for Figure 3. The average EC50 neutralization
titers obtained from independent neutralization studies of five mice infected
with strain H/PF/2013 (A) and MR-766 (B) are shown. Error bars reflect the SE
of three to five experiments. Statistical differences in mean EC50 were identi-
fied for each mouse using ANOVA with a multiple comparisons correction; the
fold difference and multiplicity-adjusted p values are displayed when signifi-
cant (only A, mouse #1).

 Mouse Studies
This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations in the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the NIH, and protocols
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at
the Washington University School of Medicine (assurance no. A3381-01).
ZIKV-immune sera used in neutralization studies were generated by infection
of Irf3�/� mice with a non-lethal 103 FFU dose of ZIKV strain H/PF/2013 or
MR-766. Additional details can be found in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
Statistical Methods
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software. Mean
EC50 values were compared using an unpaired t test or ANOVA with Tukey’s
method for multiple comparisons correction and reported as p values or mul-
tiplicity-adjusted p values, respectively, when significant (%0.05).
