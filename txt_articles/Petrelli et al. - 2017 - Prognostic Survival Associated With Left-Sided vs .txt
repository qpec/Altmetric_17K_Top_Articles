IMPORTANCE Primary tumor location is emerging as an important prognostic factor owing to
distinct biological features. However, the side of origin of colon cancer (CC) still does not
represent a prognostic parameter when deciding for adjuvant or palliative chemotherapy.
OBJECTIVE To determine the prognostic role of left vs right-sidedness of primary tumor
location in patients with CC.
DATA SOURCES We searched PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science,
LILACS, CINAHL, and SCOPUS for prospective or retrospective studies reporting data on
overall survival for left-sided colon cancer (LCC) compared with right-sided colon cancer
(RCC).
STUDY SELECTION Studies were selected if: (1) side of CC was reported among variables
entered into survival analysis, (2) survival information was available (overall survival [OS] was
reported in the article as hazard ratio (HR) according to multivariate analysis, (3) articles were
published in the English language.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were pooled using HRs for OS of LCC vs RCC
according to fixed or random-effects models. Subgroup analysis and multivariate
random-effects model meta-regression was also implemented adjusting for stage
distribution, sample size, race, year of publication, type and quality of studies, and adjuvant
chemotherapy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES HRs for OS (the primary outcome measure) were pooled to
provide an aggregate value. In this analysis, all HRs with 95% CIs were pooled to obtain
prognostic information on the location of the primary tumor (left vs right location site of CC)
independent of other common clinicopathological covariates.
RESULTS An analysis was made from the 66 studies conducted. It included 1 437 846 patients
with a median follow-up of 65 months. Left sided primary tumor location was associated with
a significantly reduced risk of death (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.79-0.84; P < .001) and this was
independent of stage, race, adjuvant chemotherapy, year of study, number of participants,
and quality of included studies.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Based on these results, CC side should be acknowledged as a
criterion for establishing prognosis in all stages of disease. It should be considered when
deciding treatment intensity in metastatic settings, and should represent a stratification
factor for future adjuvant studies.

A
ccordingtotherecentEUROCARE5analysis,1colonand
rectal cancer presented a minimal but significant in-
crease in 5-year survival across years by about 4 to 6%,
with worst survival with increasing age. In particular, colon
cancer (CC) cases diagnosed with screening colonoscopy have
lower stage disease at presentation but also have better out-
comes independent of their staging.2 Standard clinicopatho-
logical risk factors for disease progression and death that lead
totheprescriptionofpostsurgicaltherapyarestage(nodeposi-
tive disease), grade, obstructing and/or perforating presenta-
tion, vascular invasion, and pT4 classification. All these vari-
ables are taken into account for selecting patients for adjuvant
chemotherapy in stage II and III disease, according to major
guidelines. In metastatic CC, the extent of cancer and aim of
therapy (operable vs inoperable metastases), RAS mutation,
and performance status guide the choice of systemic therapy.
There are suggestions that localization of CC (right CC
[RCC]3,4 sided up to splenic flexure and left CC [LCC], includ-
ing descending, and sigmoid and/or rectosigmoid cancers) po-
tentially influences prognosis owing to differing biological fea-
tures. Clinical presentation is also different: iron deficiency
anemia from occult blood loss is more prevalent in patients
with right-sided CCs; conversely, hematochezia and change in
bowel habits is a more common presenting symptom for left-
sided CCs.3 From a molecular point of view, RCC and LCC are
2 different entities, with RCC associated with defective mis-
match repair (MMR) genes, mutations of KRAS and BRAF, and
microRNA-31, whereas LCC is associated with CIN, p53, NRAS,
microRNA-146a, microRNA-147b, and microRNA-1288.4 Lo-
cation of primary tumor seems to influence the outcome with
adjuvant therapy and the survival with palliative chemo-
therapy or targeted therapy in stage IV disease. In fact, in the
phase III N0147 trial5 comparing FOLFOX and FOLFOX plus ce-
tuximab LCC was associated with an overall better disease-
free survival as compared with RCC. Similarly, Weiss et al6
showed a better outcome for left-sided compared with right-
sided diseases in stage III but not in stage II CCs. In the same
manner,metastaticLCCsexhibitedabetteroutcomethanRCCs
in previously untreated patients.7
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we evalu-
ated the independent prognostic value of site of primary tu-
mor(left-sidedvsright-sidedprimarylocation)inpatientswith
cancer of the colon.
Methods
We performed this systematic review and meta-analysis in ac-
cordance with PRISMA guidelines and the Cochrane Hand-
book for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.
Search Strategy
References for this systematic review and meta-analysis were
identified through searches of PubMed, the Cochrane Li-
brary, SCOPUS, Web of Science, EMBASE, LILACS, and CINAHL
from inception to February 2016. A manual update of meet-
ing abstracts presented at 2016 American Society of Clinical
Oncology was also performed. Searches included the terms:
“colon or colorectal” “cancer or carcinoma” and “right or left
or site or side or descending or sigmoid or proximal or distal
or cecum” and “hazard ratio” and “multivariate or Cox regres-
sion”. Manual selection of relevant studies was carried out
based also on the related articles function. The citation lists
of all retrieved articles were analyzed to identify other poten-
tially relevant reports.
Study Selection and Data Extraction
The following criteria for eligibility among studies were set be-
fore collecting the articles: (1) site of CC was reported (right vs
left side or as other subsites), (2) survival information (OS or
cancer-specific survival [CSS]) at specific follow-up was re-
ported in the article as HRs according to multivariate cox re-
gression analysis, after primary tumor location was associ-
ated with significant results in univariate analysis, (3) articles
were published in the English language, (4) when several ar-
ticles were published by the same authors or group, the new-
est or most informative single article was selected. Exclusion
criteria were the following: (1) no information on OS was pro-
vided, (2) letters to editor and/or commentary, reviews, ar-
ticles published in a book, or papers published in a nonEng-
lish language, (3) clinical studies reporting odds ratios or risk
ratios, or only univariate analyses, and (4) studies comparing
colon cancer with rectal cancer. If studies compared RCC with
LCCincludingsomerectalandrectosigmoidcancers,theywere
included, provided that rectal cancer was the minority of
presented cases.
Two authors (F.P. and G.T.) conducted the search and iden-
tification independently, and the selection of an article was
reached by consensus with a third author (S.B.). The follow-
ing information was extracted from each report by the 2 au-
thors independently: author, year of publication, country, pa-
tient number, type of study, side of primary tumor rates (right
vs left CCs, %), chemotherapy exposure (rate), survival data
(HRs), and covariates investigated in multivariate analysis.
Statistical Analysis
For analysis of survival results, HRs were pooled to provide an
aggregate value. In this analysis, all HRs with 95% CIs ob-
tained from multivariate analysis (adjusted for the maximum
number of covariates significantly associated with OS in uni-
variate analysis) and available in the articles were combined
Key Points
Question What is the prognostic role of primary tumor location
(left vs right) in patients with colon cancer?
Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis which
included 66 studies with more than 1.4 million patients, a
significant prognostic impact of tumor site on overall survival was
found with a 20% reduced risk of death for cancers arising on the
left side.
Meaning Based on these results, colon cancer primary tumor
sidedness should be acknowledged as a criterion for establishing
prognosis in both earlier and advanced stages of disease.

to obtain prognostic information on the location of the pri-
mary tumor (left vs right side of CC) independent of other clini-
copathological covariates. Sensitivity analysis was per-
formed according to race of participants (Asian vs nonAsian
origin, the number of patients > vs < of the median number),
stage (I-III vs IV), year of publication (<2006 vs 2006-2016),
quality (high vs low quality papers), and type of study (retro-
spective vs prospective). To explore the impact of interstudy
variability in the inclusion of different stages of CCs, we also
conducted a multivariate random-effects model meta-
regression of OS adjusted for the proportion of patients with
stage I, II, III, and IV disease, the rate of patients that received
chemotherapy in stage II disease, and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale
(NOS) assessment. Data were entered into the Comprehen-
sive Meta-Analysis software (version 3.3.070, Biostat). The
Cochran’
s test was used to assess the heterogeneity of in-
cluded studies. For heterogeneity tests, P values less than .05
were considered to indicate significance. If the test of hetero-
geneity was significant (P < .05 or I2 > 50%), the random-
effectsmodelwasusedtopooltheestimateacrossstudieswith
the Der Simonian-Laird method. Otherwise, the fixed-effects
model was used. By convention, an observed HR of <1
implied better survival for patients with left-sided cancers.
We used the NOS for risk of bias assessment.8,9 This scale
assesses the likelihood of bias in 3 domains: (1) selection of the
study groups; (2) comparability of groups; and (3) ascertain-
ment of exposure and outcome. Studies with scores of 7 or
higher were considered as having a low risk of bias, scores of
4 to 6 as having a moderate risk of bias, and scores less than 4
as having a high risk of bias. We assessed that follow-up was
adequate if the median follow-up was more than 5 years for
early stages of CC and more than 3 years for stage IV CC.
We finally investigated the publication bias for OS meta-
analyses with a visual inspection of funnel plots and with the
Begg-Mazumdar Kendall’
s τ10 and Egger’
s bias test.11 More-
over, in the presence of publication bias for the primary analy-
sis, we conducted a trim and fill adjusted analysis12 to re-
move the most extreme small studies from the positive side
of the funnel plot, and recalculated the effect size at each it-
eration, until the funnel plot was symmetric about the (new)
effect size. This analysis was performed including in the main
analysis those studies with a nonsignificant association of side
with OS from univariate analysis.
Results
A total of 1938 potentially relevant citations were reviewed
(Figure 1). Among them, 29 reported OS data either as risk ra-
tios, odds ratios, or not provided multivariate analysis, or they
did not report 95% CI for inclusion in the final analysis. Ulti-
mately, 66 studies6,7,13-76 published from 1995 to 2016, that re-
ported the prognostic value of CC site were analyzed. The total
number of patients included was 1 437 846 ranging from 87 to
279 623 patients per study (median, 880). The major charac-
teristics are shown in eTable 1 and 2 in the Supplement.
In 59 publications, a retrospective analysis of patients with
CC was presented; all other papers reported a prospective
cohort series or studies of surgically treated patients with CC.
According to race, the majority of patients were white (n = 56);
the remaining 10 publications included Asian participants.
Twenty studies reported on stage IV disease and 25 reported
on stages I to III. Twenty papers included all stages of disease
and in 1 study stages were not reported. Rates of RCCs ranged
from 17.6% to 67% and LCCs from 10% to 71% of all included
patients (data not available only in 3 articles). The quality of
article expressed by the NOS scale ranged from 5 to 9, with 75%
includingstudiesofhighquality(NOSscoresrangingfrom7-9).
Meta-Analysis of Overall Survival
Because the heterogeneity test showed a high level of hetero-
geneity (I2 = 93%; P < .001) between the studies, a random-
effects model was used for the analysis. A pooled HR of 0.82
(95%CI,0.79-0.84;P < .001)frommultivariateanalysisshowed
that patients with LCC were associated with an increased sur-
vival rate (Figures 2 and 3).
Subgroup Analysis and Meta-Regression
The subgroup analysis performed according to the number of
patients(> or < ofthecalculatedmediannumber),showedthat
in the largest studies (>880 participants), the effect size was
inferior to the smallest studies (<880 participants) with HRs
of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.81-0.87) and 0.7 (95% CI, 0.65-0.76), re-
spectively (P < .001 for subgroups difference). Analysis ac-
cording to race (Asian vs nonAsian race of included patients)
leads to a similar effect on OS for LCCs: HRs of 0.8 (95% CI,
0.71-0.89) and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.79-0.85; P < .001), respec-
tively. Both studies with prospective (HR, 0.82; 95% CI; 0.73-
0.91) and retrospective design (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.78-0.84)
and higher vs lower quality (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.78-0.84 and
HR,0.82;95%CI,0.75-0.88respectively;P < .001andP < .001,
respectively) gave identical results. Results did not change ac-
cording to year of publication (1995-2005 and 2006-2016).

Meta-regression showed that the effect size did not de-
pend on stage (P = .35, 0.48, 0.41 and 0.41 after adjustment
for stage I, II, III and IV, respectively). When meta-regression
was performed according to the rate of patients that received
adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II (virtually all stage III and
IV received systemic treatment and none received it for stage
I disease) the results remained significant even after adjust-
mentforadjuvanttreatment(coefficient,−0.36;P = .11).There-
fore, the high heterogeneity could be partially explained by the
different population included in the meta-analysis, with both
early and metastatic tumors and with similar effect in stages
II, III, and IV.
Under the random-effects model, the pooled HR ob-
tained from both multivariate and univariate HRs (the latter

Discussion
An increasingly large amount of evidence is accumulating
showing that colon tumors proximal and distal to splenic flex-
ure are distinct clinical and biological entities. Apart from hav-
ing a different embryological origin—proximal colon from mid-
gut and distal colon and rectum from hindgut—the right colon
displays peculiar differences in mucosal immunology, prob-
ably owing to differences in gut microbiota.77 A higher con-
centrationofeosinophilsandintraepithelialTcellsintheproxi-
mal colon compared with the distal colorectum has been
reported.78-80 It has been hypothesized that this could be the
result of the delicate balance that immune cells have to main-
tain between immunogenicity against pathogens and toler-
ance for the commensal microbiota, which is much more rep-
resented in the distal colorectum. This observation could also
explain the differences in immunological response to tumors
developing in the proximal colon characterized by an in-
creased immune activity and, in turn, reflect the specific dif-
ferences in pathogenesis and outcome. Tumors arising on the
right side of the colon, in fact, seem to follow different mo-
lecular pathways of oncogenesis. These RCCs more com-
monly are diploid and characterized by mucinous histology,

high microsatellite instability, CpG island methylation, and
BRAF mutations.81-85 Conversely, LCCs were found to have fre-
quently p53 and KRAS mutations.86
In stage II completely resected CC, the presence of MSI has
been associated with a more favorable prognosis and a lack of
benefit from fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy.84
More recently, Sinicrope et al5 evaluated the prognostic im-
pact of deficient DNA MMR in patients with stage III enrolled
in a randomized trial of FOLFOX-based adjuvant chemo-
therapy and found that among deficient MMR cancers only
proximal tumors had favorable outcome.
Results from our analysis clearly demonstrate that pri-
mary tumor location has a critical role in determining CC prog-
nosis, being a surrogate of different and poor biology. This
analysis included 66 published studies and analyzed 1 437 846
CC patients with overall survival data available. To our knowl-
edge, this is the first meta-analysis that describes the site of
colon cancer (right vs left) as an independent prognostic fac-
tor in both early and advanced disease. Specifically, bearing a
tumor originating in the left side of the colon was signifi-
cantly associated with an absolute 19% reduced risk of death.
Such a survival benefit was independent of race, stage (II, III,
and IV), year of publication, and type of studies, and deeper
for smallest (<880 patients) compared with largest series. As
a possible consequence of the higher representation of MSI-
positive cases in proximal cancers and of the associated bet-
ter prognosis, the difference, although again significant, was
less pronounced for early stages as compared with the ad-
vanced ones. When meta-regression was performed, side re-
mained prognostic in patients with stage II disease after ad-
justing for adjuvant chemotherapy received. Finally, the
prognostic information of side remained significant after ad-
justmentforallstages.Ourworkconfirmsandemphasizespre-

tumor location in clinical decision-making processes.6,45,87 In
particular, the prognostic impact of CC side of origin, has been
recently assessed in about 2000 patients with previously un-
treated metastatic CC receiving first-line chemotherapy plus
bevacizumab in 3 independent cohorts: a prospective phar-
macogenetic study (PROVETTA) and 2 randomized phase 3
trials, AVF2107g and NO16966.7 In all cohorts considered, pa-
tients with left-sided tumors showed superior OS. Finally, at
multivariate analysis, right-sided location was confirmed to
beanegativeprognosticvariableindependentofmucinoushis-
tology and BRAF mutational status. Unfortunately, our data
did not allow an analysis according to histology and muta-
tional status.
Apartfromintrinsicbiologicaldifferences(ie,higherrateof
BRAFmutantcases)relatedtoamoreaggressiveclinicalbehav-
ior, we believe that several other factors must be taken into ac-
counttoexplaintheworseoverallprognosisforpatientswithRCC.
The first possible reason may involve the surgical tech-
nique. Similar to total mesorectal excision (TME), which was
the cause of a significant decline in the incidence of local re-
currenceafteritsintroductionasstandardapproachinmidand
low rectal cancer, complete mesocolic excision (CME) has been
advocated by many as the better option for tumors arising in
the right colon. Complete mesocolic excision consists of com-
plete removal of the intact mesentery and high ligation of the
vascular supply at its origin.88 The rationale behind this pro-
cedure is that a more extensive surgery, by reducing the risk
of local recurrence, might guarantee superior disease-free and
overall survival. A retrospective study88 analyzed 1329 pa-
tients who had undergone CME in a single center and showed
verypromisingresultswith5-yearcancerspecificsurvivalrates
of 91.4% in patients with stage II and 70.2% in patients with
stage III disease. More recently, a case-control study89 from
Denmark confirmed that CME represents a valid and poten-
tiallybetteroptionassociatedwithsignificantdisease-freesur-
vival benefit in patients with stages I to III CC compared with
conventional surgery. However, in the absence of prospec-
tive randomized trials, a consensus conference agreed that
there are sound oncological reasons for recommending a more
radical surgical approach.90
Further hypotheses can be advanced to explain the bet-
ter outcomes of LCCs. Among these, a different sensitivity to
chemotherapy has been postulated. As reported from a FIRE3
and CALGB/SWOG 80405 trial subgroup analysis, it has been
suggested that anti-EGFR therapy has a decreased benefit in
patientswithright-colontumors.76,91SinceRASmutationalsta-
tus is the only accepted predictor of effectiveness from such
treatments so far, these provocative results suggest that other
biomarkers and clinical parameters deserve to be investi-
gated. Again, beyond the higher rate of BRAF mutations, right-
colon tumors are more likely to have MSI or to display a CpG
island methylator phenotype. In fact, worsened PFS for pa-
tients with CpG island methylator phenotype-high RAS-wt
and/or BRAF-wt tumors treated with anti-EGFR therapy, has
been recently reported.92 Moreover, a meta-analysis of 463
RAS-wtand/orBRAF-mutcolorectalpatientsshowedthatanti-
EGFR drugs, when added to standard therapy or best support-
ive care, do not confer any significant advantage in response
rate, PFS, or OS, as compared with control regimens.93
In addition to the need for improving molecular selection
of patients with CC to achieve better outcomes, patients with
right-sided tumors may deserve more aggressive treatments,
especially in advanced settings and, potentially, in stage II tu-
mors, when there are no other adverse prognostic factors. In-
deed,asdescribedintheclinicalsubgroupanalysisoftheTRIBE
trial,94 a trend toward a PFS benefit from the intensification
of the chemotherapy backbone in patients with RCC emerged
(HR, 0.66 for RCC vs HR, 0.82 for LCCs; P = .20). Therefore,
one may speculate that the corresponding worse prognosis of
proximal tumors in advanced stages could also be related to
the use of suboptimal systemic treatment.

ing 13 trials with HRs derived from univariate analysis only, the
main analysis would have not changed significantly the effect
size. The strength of our analysis is represented by the overall

CC),theindependentprognosticsignificanceofCCsideaccord-
ing to multivariate analysis, and the lack of significant and
obvious biases with funnel plot and Egger’
s test.
Conclusions
Based on the results of this study, the side of origin of CC
(left vs right) should be acknowledged as a criterion
