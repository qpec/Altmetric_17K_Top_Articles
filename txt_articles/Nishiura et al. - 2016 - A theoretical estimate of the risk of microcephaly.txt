Objectives:
 There  has  been  a
 growing
 concern
 over  Zika  virus  (ZIKV)
 infection,
 particularly
 since  a  probable
link
 between
 ZIKV  infection
 during  pregnancy
 and
 microcephaly
 in  the  baby  was identified.
 The  present
study
 aimed
 to estimate
 a theoretical
 risk
 of
 microcephaly
 during  pregnancy
 with  ZIKV
 infection
 in
Northeastern
 Brazil  in  2015.
Methods:
 Temporal
 distributions
 of  microcephaly,
 reported
 dengue-like
 illness
 and  dengue  seropositive
in
 Brazil  were  extracted
 from  secondary
 data
 sources.
 Using  an  integral
 equation
 model  and  a  backcal-
culation
 technique,
 we  estimated
 the  risk
 of  microcephaly
 during  pregnancy
 with  Zika  virus infection.
Results:
 If  the  fraction
 of  Zika  virus  infections
 among
 a  total  of
 seronegative
 dengue-like
 illness  cases
 is
30%,
 the  risk  of  microcephaly
 following
 infection
 during
 the  first  trimester
 was  estimated
 at 46.7% (95%
CI:
 9.1,  84.2),  comparable
 to  the  risk  of congenital
 rubella
 syndrome.
 However,
 the  risk  of  microcephaly
was
 shown
 to vary  widely
 from  14.0%
 to  100%.
 The  mean  gestational
 age  at  delivery  with  microcephaly
was
 estimated
 at 37.5  weeks
 (95%
 CI:  36.9,  39.3).
Conclusions:
 The  time  interval
 between
 peaks
 of  reported
 dengue-like
 illness
 and
 microcephaly
 was
consistent
 with  cause–outcome
 relationship.
 Our modeling
 framework
 predicts
 that  the  incidence
 of
microcephaly
 is
 expected
 to  steadily
 decline
 in  early  2016,  Brazil.

 Introduction
There
 has
 been
 a
 growing
 concern
 over
 Zika
 virus
 (ZIKV)
 infec-
tion
 (Musso
 et
 al.,
 2015;
 Ventura
 et
 al.,
 2016),
 particularly
 since
a
 probable
 link
 between
 ZIKV
 infection
 during
 pregnancy
 and
microcephaly
 was
 identified
 (Schuler-Faccini
 et
 al.,
 2016).
 Clini-
cal
 symptoms
 of
 ZIKV
 are
 self-limiting
 in
 general
 and
 the
 infection
is
 sometimes
 even
 sub-clinical,
 but
 severe
 complications
 including
microcephaly
 and
 Guillain–Barré
 syndrome
 justify
 global
 effort
 to
actively
 monitor
 and
 control
 the
 spread
 of
 this
 disease.
 The
 trans-
mission
 potential
 of
 Zika
 virus
 infection
 in
 the
 South
 Pacific
 has
been
 shown
 to
 be
 comparable
 to
 dengue
 and
 chikungunya
 viruses
(Nishiura
 et
 al.,
 2016a).

Brazil
 has
 experienced
 a
 large
 ZIKV
 epidemic
 with
 the
 noti-
fication
 of
 a
 substantial
 number
 of
 microcephaly
 cases,
 which
have
 increased
 almost
 20-fold
 compared
 to
 the
 recent
 years.
 In
particular,
 Northeastern
 Brazil
 has
 notified
 more
 than
 85%
 of
 all
microcephaly
 cases
 that
 have
 been
 reported
 in
 Brazil,
 2015
 as
of
 the
 end
 of
 2015.
 Considering
 that
 the
 risk
 of
 microcephaly
 is
a
 substantial
 public
 health
 concern,
 it
 is
 fruitful
 to
 quantify
 the
risk
 of
 contracting
 microcephaly
 given
 ZIKV
 infection
 during
 early
gestational
 period
 of
 pregnancy.
 Elucidating
 the
 epidemiological
mechanism
 of
 microcephaly
 could
 also
 shed
 light
 on
 future
 course
of
 the
 ongoing
 epidemic.
The
 present
 study
 estimated
 the
 risk
 of
 microcephaly
 during
pregnancy
 with
 ZIKV
 infection,
 analyzing
 epidemiological
 datasets
of
 reported
 dengue-like
 illness
 and
 microcephaly
 in
 Northeastern
Brazil
 in
 2015.

 Materials
 and
 methods
2.1.
 Epidemiological
 data
We  analyzed
 the
 epidemiological
 datasets
 of
 microcephaly
 and
dengue-like
 illness,
 retrieved
 from
 publicly
 available
 secondary
data
 sources.
 Both
 of
 them
 are
 reported
 as
 the
 cumulative
 number,
and
 we
 focused
 on
 the
 dataset
 from
 Northeastern
 Brazil
 (Ministério
da
 Saúde,
 2016a).
 Microcephaly
 is
 defined
 as
 a
 head
 circumference
of
 more
 than
 2
 SDs
 below
 the
 mean
 for
 age
 and
 gender,
 and
 can
 be
caused
 by
 a
 variety
 of
 reasons
 including
 infection
 with
 Zika
 virus
(suspected),
 syphilis,
 toxoplasmosis,
 rubella,
 cytomegalovirus
 and
other
 infectious
 agents.
 Dengue-like
 illness
 is
 collected
 as
 a
 part
 of
syndromic
 surveillance
 (Ministério
 da
 Saúde,
 2016b),
 and
 is
 clini-
cally
 defined
 as
 a
 patient
 who
 has
 acute
 febrile
 illness
 accompanied
by
 at
 least
 two
 of
 the
 following
 symptoms:
 headache,
 retro-orbital
pain,
 myalgia,
 arthralgia,
 prostration
 and
 rash
 (Ministério
 da
 Saúde,
2009).
 The
 latest
 time
 at
 which
 the
 data
 were
 collated
 for
 the
 study
was
 20th
 February,
 2016.
 Accessible
 data
 of
 microcephaly
 have
been
 available
 from
 week
 47
 of
 2015
 for
 6
 weeks
 (Ministério
 da
Saúde,
 2016a).
 Due
 to
 increased
 awareness,
 the
 reporting
 cover-
age
 is
 likely
 to
 have
 been
 considerably
 elevated
 from
 2016
 and
 the
validity
 of
 microcephaly
 diagnoses
 has
 been
 questioned
 elsewhere
(Victora
 et
 al.,
 2016).
 For
 this
 reason,
 we
 focused
 on
 microcephaly
data
 within
 2015
 only.
In
 addition,
 the
 following
 three
 pieces
 of
 information
 were
retrieved.
 First,
 the
 number
 of
 serological
 samples
 and
 the
 outcome
of
 serological
 testing
 for
 dengue
 virus
 over
 time
 were
 also
 collected,
focusing
 on
 Northeastern
 Brazil
 (Ministério
 da
 Saúde,
 2016b).
 Sec-
ond,
 a
 point
 estimate
 of
 the
 proportion
 of
 pregnant
 women
 among
a
 total
 population
 was
 calculated
 using
 Brazilian
 census
 (United
Nations
 Population
 Division,
 2016).
 Third,
 gestational
 age
 distribu-
tion
 of
 delivery
 in
 Brazil
 was
 extracted
 to
 calculate
 the
 variance
of
 the
 time
 from
 pregnancy
 to
 delivery
 (Pereira
 et
 al.,
 2013).
 Due
to
 scarcity
 of
 the
 dataset,
 gestational
 ages
 of
 22–29
 weeks
 and
 43
weeks
 and
 longer
 were
 omitted
 from
 the
 distribution
 during
 the
implementation
 of
 statistical
 estimation.
2.2.
 Statistical
 analysis
Using
 the
 following
 integral
 equation
 model,
 we
 estimate,
 �,
the
 conditional
 risk
 of
 microcephaly
 given
 ZIKV
 infection
 during
 the
first
 trimester
 of
 pregnancy.
 Using
 the
 weekly
 incidence
 of
 dengue-
like
 illness,
 ct
 −s+a,
 which
 occurred
 between
 a1 and
 a2 weeks
 of
gestation
 (i.e.,
 between
 times
 t
 −
 s
 +
 a1 and
 t
 −
 s
 +
 a2),
 the
 expected
number
 of
 microcephaly,
 E(mt),
 at
 time
 t,
 is
 written
 as
E(mt)
 = �zb
qr
∞
�
s=1
a2
�
a=a1
(1
 −
 pt−s+a) ct−s+agafs(�,
 �2),
 
(1)
where
 pt is
 the
 time-dependent
 proportion
 of
 seropositive
 for
dengue
 virus
 infection
 among
 all
 serological
 samples,
 and
 q
 is
the
 proportion
 of
 ZIKV
 cases
 who
 sought
 medical
 treatment.
 z
represents
 the
 fraction
 of
 ZIKV
 infections
 among
 seronegative
dengue-like
 illness
 cases.
 b
 is
 a
 point
 estimate
 of
 the
 proportion
of
 pregnant
 women
 among
 a
 total
 population.
 r
 is
 the
 proportion
 of
actual
 microcephaly
 cases
 among
 all
 notified
 cases
 of
 microcephaly.
ga is
 the
 frequency
 of
 successful
 infection
 in
 fetus
 given
 an
 expo-
sure
 at
 gestational
 age
 a,
 and
 fs is
 the
 probability
 density
 function
 of
the
 time
 from
 pregnancy
 to
 delivery.
 ga was
 assumed
 be
 uniformly
distributed
 during
 the
 first
 trimester
 of
 pregnancy,
 because
 this
 is
the
 period
 when
 there
 appears
 to
 be
 a
 high
 risk
 of
 microcephaly
 (de
Paula
 Freitas
 et
 al.,
 2016).
 Different
 sources
 define
 different
 lengths
of
 the
 time
 for
 the
 first
 trimester
 ranging
 from
 12
 to
 16
 weeks,
 how-
ever
 the
 default
 parameterization
 was
 taken
 to
 be
 a1 =
 1
 and
 a2 =
 12.
In
 a
 sensitivity
 analysis,
 it
 was
 assumed
 that
 a2 ranges
 from
 12
 to
16.
 fs was
 assumed
 to
 follow
 a
 gamma
 distribution
 as
 the
 visual
assessment
 of
 fit
 to
 term
 delivery
 data
 was
 satisfactory.
 Since
 the
variance
 of
 gestational
 age
 at
 delivery
 appeared
 not
 to
 be
 devi-
ated
 from
 term
 delivery
 in
 Brazil
 (De
 Araujo
 et
 al.,
 2016),
 and
 thus,
the
 variance
 of
 fs was
 fixed
 at
 3.78
 weeks2 (Pereira
 et
 al.,
 2013).
However,
 considering
 that
 microcephaly
 could
 lead
 to
 delivery
 at
an
 early
 gestational
 age,
 the
 mean
 (�)
 was
 jointly
 estimated
 with
other
 parameters.
Tables
 1
 and
 2
 list
 estimated
 and
 known
 parameters
 and
 vari-
ables,
 respectively.
 This
 formulation
 is
 close
 to
 the
 idea
 used
 for
congenital
 rubella
 syndrome
 (Gao
 et
 al.,
 2013;
 Cutts
 and
 Vynnycky,
1999),
 calculating
 the
 risk
 of
 fetus
 infection
 using
 epidemiological
data
 and
 risk
 parameters
 governing
 infection
 in
 pregnant
 women.
A
 maximum
 likelihood
 method
 was
 employed
 to
 estimate
unknown
 parameters,
 �,
 pt,
 q,
 r
 and
 �
 (among
 which
 pt was
 dealt
with
 as
 varying
 with
 time).
 Assuming
 that
 the
 weekly
 count
 of
microcephaly
 cases
 follows
 a
 Poisson
 distribution,
 the
 correspond-
ing
 likelihood
 function
 to
 estimate
 parameters
 based
 on
 the
 dataset
from
 week
 47
 to
 52
 is
L1(�,
 pt,
 q,
 r,
 �;
 ct,
 xt)
 =
52
�
t=47
E(mt;
 ct)xt exp (−E (mt;
 ct))
xt!
,
 
(2)
where
 xt is
 the
 observed
 incidence
 of
 microcephaly
 in
 week
 t.
The
 conditional
 risk
 of
 medical
 attendance
 given
 ZIKV
 infection,
q
 was
 assumed
 to
 follow
 a
 binomial
 distribution.
 Supposing
 that
l
 cases
 attended
 clinics
 among
 a
 total
 of
 k
 estimated
 number
 of
infections,
 the
 likelihood
 function
 to
 estimate
 q
 is
L2(q;
 k,
 l)
 =
�
k
l
�
ql(1
 −
 q)k−l,
 
(3)
Since
 there
 was
 no
 dataset
 that
 permitted
 us
 to
 explicitly
 esti-
mate
 q
 in
 Brazil,
 we
 used
 Yap
 Island
 seroepidemiological
 data
 in
2007
 and
 compensated
 the
 estimate
 from
 Eq.
 (3)
 into
 the
 informa-
tion
 as
 a
 part
 of
 the
 right
 hand
 side
 of
 Eq.
 (1).
In
 addition
 to
 the
 syndromic
 data,
 serological
 testing
 has
 been
performed
 for
 a
 small
 fraction
 of
 dengue-like
 illness
 cases
 over
time.
 We  assume
 that
 empirically
 examined
 seroepidemiological
samples
 are
 representative
 of
 all
 reported
 dengue-like
 illness
 cases.
The
 probability
 of
 seropositive
 becoming
 a
 confirmed
 dengue
 case
given
 dengue-like
 illness
 status
 (i.e.,
 given
 clinical/syndromic
 diag-
nosis)
 was
 also
 similarly
 calculated
 from
 binomial
 distribution.
Assuming
 that
 there
 were
 it positive
 samples
 among
 a
 total
 of
 ht
serological
 samples,
 we
 have
L3(pt;
 ht,
 it)
 =
�
t
�
ht
it
�
ptit (1
 −
 pt)ht−it ,
 
(4)
Similarly,
 referring
 to
 an
 epidemiological
 study
 that
 assessed
diagnostic
 accuracy
 of
 reported
 microcephaly
 (and
 emphasized
that
 more
 than
 half
 of
 reported
 microcephaly
 cases
 did
 not
 satisfy
the
 clinical
 criteria
 of
 microcephaly)
 (Victora
 et
 al.,
 2016),
 a
 bino-
mial
 sampling
 process
 of
 actual
 microcephaly
 cases
 b
 given
 a
 total
of
 c
 reported
 microcephaly
 cases
 was
 modeled
 as
L4 (r
 ;
 b,
 c) =
�
c
b
�
rb(1
 −
 r)c−b
(5)
Thus,
 the
 total
 likelihood
 is
 calculated
 as
 L
 =
 L1L2L3L4.
 The
 max-
imum
 likelihood
 estimates
 of
 �,
 pt,
 q,
 r
 and
 �
 were
 identified
by
 minimizing
 the
 negative
 log-likelihood.
 The
 95%
 confidence
interval
 (CI)
 was
 computed
 by
 using
 the
 profile
 likelihood.
 The
parameter
 z
 was
 not
 estimated
 from
 empirical
 data
 due
 to
 its
 cor-
relation
 with
 �.
 Instead,
 we
 varied
 z
 from
 0
 to
 1.0,
 examining
 the
sensitivity
 of
 �
 to
 the
 value
 of
 z.

Northeastern

 was

 by
 ZIKV
 infec-
tion
 (Table
 3),
 as
 is
 observed
 from
 microcephaly
 notifications,
 and
in
 this
 Federal
 Unit,
 the
 fraction
 of
 dengue
 seropositive
 has
 been
as
 low
 as
 17.1%
 (Secretaria
 de
 Vigilancia
 em
 Saúde,
 2016),
 imply-
ing
 that
 reported
 dengue-like
 illness
 cases
 were
 contaminated
 by
substantial
 number
 of
 ZIKV
 infections
 (Nishiura
 et
 al.,
 2016b).
In
 fact,
 a
 strong
 positive
 correlation
 can
 be
 identified
 between
microcephaly
 incidence
 and
 estimated
 dengue
 seronegative
 cases,
which
 were
 originally
 notified
 as
 dengue-like
 illness
 (Fig.
 1A;
 Pear-
son’s
 r
 =
 0.788,
 p
 =
 0.012).
 Assuming
 that
 these
 dengue
 seronegative
cases
 represented
 ZIKV
 infections
 and
 using
 a
 family
 of
 backcal-
culation
 techniques,
 we
 estimated
 the
 risk
 of
 microcephaly
 given
infection
 during
 the
 first
 trimester
 of
 pregnancy.
 Since
 the
 fraction
of
 infections
 leading
 to
 medical
 attendance
 is
 not
 very
 well
 known
in
 Brazil,
 the
 risk
 of
 medical
 attendance
 given
 infection
 derived
from
 Yap
 island
 epidemic
 data
 in
 2007
 was
 jointly
 estimated
 (Duffy
et
 al.,
 2009).
Fig.

 compares
 the
 observed
 and
 estimated
 weekly

 of

 which
 were

 to
 have
 taken
 place
 in
 week
46,
 a
 few
 weeks
 before
 first
 recognition
 of
 clinical
 link
 between
microcephaly
 and
 ZIKV
 infection.
 The
 proportion
 of
 medical
 atten-
dance
 among
 a
 total
 of
 ZIKV
 infections
 was
 estimated
 at
 3.4%
 (95%
confidence
 intervals
 (CI):
 3.1,
 3.6).
 Assuming
 that
 z
 =
 1,
 the
 lowest
bound
 of
 the
 risk
 of
 microcephaly
 following
 infection
 during
 the
first
 trimester
 was
 estimated
 at
 14.0%
 (95%
 CI:
 2.7,
 25.3).
 The
 mean
gestational
 age
 at
 delivery
 with
 microcephaly
 was
 estimated
 at
 37.5
weeks
 (95%
 CI:
 36.9,
 39.3).

 while
(ii)
 the

 Discussion
The
 conditional
 risk
 of
 microcephaly
 given
 ZIKV
 infection
 during
the
 first
 trimester
 of
 pregnancy
 was
 estimated,
 and
 it
 was
 shown
that
 the
 estimate
 is
 variable
 with
 the
 fraction
 of
 ZIKV
 infections
 that
account
 for
 seronegative
 dengue-like
 illness
 cases
 (Fig.
 3).
 The
 inte-
gral
 equation
 model
 was
 shown
 to
 capture
 the
 temporal
 pattern
 of
the
 microcephaly.
 Not
 only
 did
 this
 fit
 well
 to
 the
 observed
 data,

 elsewhere
 (Rodrigues
 Faria
et
 al.,
 2016).
 The
 epidemic

 is
 coincided
 with
 the
 minimum
 estimate
 of
 dengue
seroprevalence.
but
 also
 the
 model
 predicted
 the
 incidence
 of
 microcephaly
 before
intensified
 surveillance
 for
 microcephaly
 began
 (week
 45
 and
 ear-
lier)
 and
 offered
 a
 short-term
 prediction
 of
 future
 incidence
 (week
5,
 2016
 and
 later).
 The
 model
 reasonably
 yielded
 predictions
 based
on
 exposures
 that
 had
 occurred
 more
 than
 8
 months
 ago.
 The
 pre-
diction
 has
 indicated
 that
 the
 epidemic
 of
 microcephaly
 in
 Brazil,
2016
 is
 likely
 to
 steadily
 decline
 soon
 in
 the
 future
 course.
 If
 the
 frac-
tion
 ZIKV
 infections
 among
 seronegative
 dengue-like
 illness
 cases
is
 as
 small
 as
 30%,
 the
 risk
 of
 microcephaly
 during
 pregnancy
 with
ZIKV
 infection
 would
 be
 46.7%,
 comparable
 to
 the
 risk
 of
 congenital
rubella
 syndrome
 (Cutts
 and
 Vynnycky,
 1999).
The
 estimate
 is
 likely
 useful
 for
 a
 variety
 of
 epidemiologi-
cal
 purposes.
 First,
 ZIKV
 infection
 involves
 substantial
 number
of
 asymptomatic
 and
 mild
 cases,
 and
 the
 estimated
 risk
 enables
us
 to
 calculate
 the
 total
 number
 of
 infections
 based
 on
 micro-
cephaly
 data.
 Second,
 using
 the
 backcalculation
 technique,
 a
short-term
 prediction
 of
 microcephaly
 occurrence
 can
 be
 achieved.

For
 instance,
 the
 prediction
 can
 show
 that
 the
 increased
 notification
of
 microcephaly
 from
 December
 2015
 to
 January
 2016
 is
 certainly
expected
 to
 steadily
 decline
 in
 the
 near
 future.
 Third,
 once
 an
 effec-
tive
 vaccine
 is
 developed,
 the
 expected
 impact
 of
 introducing
 ZIKV
vaccine
 into
 a
 population
 could
 be
 calculated,
 explicitly
 account-
ing
 for
 the
 disease
 burden
 associated
 with
 the
 infection
 during
pregnancy.
Our
 modeling
 exercise
 is
 not
 free
 from
 limitations,
 and
 espe-
cially,
 it
 must
 be
 remembered
 that
 the
 estimation
 involved
 a
 key
assumption
 that
 a
 certain
 fraction
 of
 seronegative
 dengue-like
 ill-
ness
 cases
 had
 been
 ZIKV
 infections
 (Rodrigues
 Faria
 et
 al.,
 2016).
Due
 to
 uncertainty
 associated
 with
 this
 assumption,
 we  have
 exam-
ined
 the
 sensitivity
 of
 the
 estimated
 risk
 of
 microcephaly
 during
pregnancy
 to
 different
 values
 of
 the
 fraction
 ZIKV
 infections
 (Fig.
 3).
Despite
 this
 strong
 assumption,
 it
 must
 be
 noted
 that
 the
 time
interval
 between
 peaks
 of
 reported
 dengue-like
 illness
 and
 micro-
cephaly
 (Fig.
 1B)
 was
 consistent
 with
 cause–outcome
 relationship,
and
 the
 estimated
 mean
 duration
 of
 pregnancy
 with
 microcephaly
(37.5
 weeks)
 was
 only
 slightly
 shorter
 than
 our
 knowledge
 of
gestational
 age
 at
 term
 delivery
 (Pereira
 et
 al.,
 2013).
 Moreover,
we
 successfully
 varied
 pt,
 the
 proportion
 seropositive
 among
 all
dengue-like
 illness
 cases
 and
 the
 estimated
 timing
 of
 minimum
seroprevalence
 coincided
 with
 the
 timing
 of
 Zika
 virus
 epidemic
peak
 as
 reported
 elsewhere
 (Rodrigues
 Faria
 et
 al.,
 2016).
 Another
limitation
 is
 the
 reporting
 coverage
 of
 microcephaly
 might
 have
been
 erroneously
 elevated
 (Ministério
 da
 Saúde,
 2009),
 especially
after
 the
 declaration
 of
 Public
 Health
 Emergency
 of
 International
Concerns
 on
 1
 February,
 2016.
 We  have
 fitted
 our
 model
 only
by
 using
 the
 dataset
 in
 2015
 before
 considerable
 increase
 in
awareness.
 Better
 estimates
 for
 Brazil
 and
 other
 countries
 at
 risk
from
 ZIKV
 infection
 could
 be
 derived
 from
 improved
 surveillance
systems
 with
 laboratory
 testing
 capacity.
 Moreover,
 we  had
 to
 com-
promise
 the
 data
 gap.
 The
 incidence
 of
 dengue-like
 illness
 was
complemented
 by
 fitting
 a
 spline
 curve
 to
 an
 observed
 cumula-
tive
 number,
 because
 the
 direct
 calculation
 of
 weekly
 incidence
sometimes
 yielded
 a
 negative
 value.
Despite
 the
 existence
 of
 reporting
 bias
 and
 a
 data
 gap,
 our
 mod-
eling
 study
 certainly
 provides
 predictions
 which
 are
 in
 agreement
with
 the
 reported
 trend
 of
 microcephaly
 in
 Brazil,
 and
 the
 cur-
rent
 epidemic
 of
 microcephaly
 in
 Brazil
 is
 expected
 to
 steadily
decline
 in
 the
 early
 part
 of
 2016.
 Considering
 the
 severe
 disease
burden
 of
 ZIKV
 infection,
 it
 is
 highly
 recommended
 that
 intensified
surveillance
 is
 introduced
 and
 that
 ZIKV
 infection
 using
 serological
samples
 from
 dengue-like
 illness
 is
 examined
 for
 early
 and
 accurate
detection
 of
 possible
 future
 ZIKV
 outbreaks.
