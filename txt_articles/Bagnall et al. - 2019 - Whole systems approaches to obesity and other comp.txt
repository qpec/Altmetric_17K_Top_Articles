Abstract
Background: Increasing awareness of the complexity of public health problems, including obesity, has led to
growing interest in whole systems approaches (WSAs), defined as those that consider the multifactorial drivers
of overweight and obesity, involve transformative co-ordinated action across a broad range of disciplines and
stakeholders, operate across all levels of governance and throughout the life course. This paper reports a systematic
review of WSAs targeting obesity and other complex public health and societal issues, such as healthy lifestyles for
prevention of non-communicable disease.
Methods: Seven electronic databases were searched from 1995 to 2018. Studies were included if there had been an
effort to implement a WSA. Study selection was conducted by one reviewer with a random 20% double checked. Data
extraction and validity assessment were undertaken by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Narrative
synthesis was undertaken.
Results: Sixty-five articles were included; 33 about obesity. Most examined multicomponent community approaches,
and there was substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity. Nevertheless, a range of positive health outcomes
were reported, with some evidence of whole systems thinking. Positive effects were seen on health behaviours, body
mass index (BMI), parental and community awareness, community capacity building, nutrition and physical activity
environments, underage drinking behaviour and health, safety and wellbeing of community members, self-efficacy,
smoking and tobacco-related disease outcomes.
Features of successful approaches reported in process evaluations included: full engagement of relevant partners and
community; time to build relationships, trust and capacity; good governance; embedding within a broader policy
context; local evaluation; finance.
Conclusions: Systems approaches to tackle obesity can have some benefit, but evidence of how to operationalise a
WSA to address public health problems is still in its infancy. Future research should: (a) develop an agreed
definition of a WSA in relation to obesity, (b) look across multiple sectors to ensure consistency of language
and definition, (c) include detailed descriptions of the approaches, and (d) include process and economic
evaluations.

 Background
In recent years, in response to the increasing awareness
of the complexity of many public health problems,
there has been growing interest in the role of systems-
based approaches in public health. In 2007, the UK
Foresight map [1] presented a pioneering portrayal of
the complex web of obesity causation. In the same year
the American Journal of Community Psychology de-
voted an edition to systems-thinking. In 2008 Mabry et
al. [2] outlined the strategic vision of the Office of Be-
havioural and Social Sciences Research at the National
Institutes of Health, listing systems science as one of
four key programmatic directions, and the importance
of systems thinking was also noted in the 2011 and
2015 Lancet Series on Obesity [3, 4].
In 2010 a number of evidence reviews were under-
taken for the National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence (NICE) [5–7], intended to inform the de-
velopment of NICE guidelines on the prevention of
obesity using a whole system approach (WSA) (note
that the scope of the work was changed and instead
resulted in the development of NICE guidelines on
whole of community approaches) [5, 8].
The Garside et al. [5] review - one of those commis-
sioned by NICE – which aimed to identify key elements
of a WSA to obesity, reported that an “authentic” WSA
draws on complexity science and complex adaptive sys-
tems. Although there is no consensus on a formal def-
inition of “complex adaptive systems”, there is broad
acceptance they contain: heterogeneous interacting ele-
ments; an emergent effect that is different from the ef-
fects of the individual elements; and persisting effects
over time that adapt to changing circumstances [9].
The NICE reviews [5–7] did not find any “authentic”
WSAs, and the definition was therefore widened to
include those programmes that were designed to work
at multiple levels among multiple agencies in a locality.
Using this definition, they identified ten features of a
WSA to tackle obesity [5] (Table 1).
Aims & objectives
The aim was to undertake a systematic review of na-
tional and international published evidence on WSAs
targeting obesity, other public health areas and areas
outside public health (such as social care, crime and
justice), to understand what is known about WSAs and
how they can be implemented in practice.
Review questions
1. What has been done in terms of a WSA to obesity,
and other complex public health problems, and how
effective have these been?
2. What elements of a WSA are effective or not
effective in (a) obesity (b) other areas of public
health (c) areas other than public health?
3. What are the barriers and facilitators to implementing
a WSA in (a) obesity (b) other areas of public health
(c) areas other than public health?
4. What is the evidence on cost-effectiveness of WSAs
in (a) obesity (b) other areas of public health (c) areas
other than public health?
Methods
This systematic review follows standard methodological
guidelines [10, 11].
Search strategy
A broad, sensitive search strategy was designed. The fol-
lowing databases were searched from January 1995 to
Table 1 10 features of a systems approach to tackle public health problems, adapted from NICE [9] and Garside et al. [5]
Identifying a system.
Explicit recognition of the public health system with the interacting, self-regulating and evolving elements of a
complex adaptive system. Recognition given that a wide range of bodies with no overt interest or objectives
referring to public health may have a role in the system and therefore that the boundaries of the system may
be broad.
Capacity building
An explicit goal to support communities and organisations within the system.
Creativity and innovation
Mechanisms to support and encourage local creativity and/ or innovation to address public health and
social problems.
Relationships
Methods of working and specific activities to develop and maintain effective relationships within and
between organisations.
Engagement
Clear methods to enhance the ability of people, organisations and sectors to engage community members in
programme development and delivery.
Communication
Mechanisms to support communication between actors and organisations within the system.
Embedded action and policies
Practices explicitly set out for public health and social improvement within organisations within the system.
Robust and sustainable
Clear strategies to resource existing and new projects and staff.
Facilitative leadership
Strong strategic support and appropriate resourcing developed at all levels.
Monitoring and evaluation
Well-articulated methods to provide ongoing feedback into the system, to drive change to enhance effectiveness
and acceptability.

 September 2015 using a combination of text and Medical
Subject Headings (MeSH terms): MEDLINE, CINAHL,
Social Science Citation Index, The Cochrane Library (in-
cludes CENTRAL, DARE, NHSEED, HTA and INAHTA
databases), PsycLIT/ PsycINFO, DoPHER, TRoPHI and
IDOX.
In February 2017 an additional update search was run
in MEDLINE, using the same search strategy applied
from January 2015 to February 2018.
Key search terms included:
(i) “whole systems approach” and related terms such
as holistic; cross-sector; systems-based approach;
multi-strategy approaches etc.
OR
(ii) Terms related to relevant initiatives such as:
Healthy Cities; Healthy Towns; Together Let’s
Prevent Childhood Obesity (EPODE);
Change4Life etc.
We also manually searched the websites of relevant
organisations such as: Department of Health; Public
Health England (PHE); Local Government Association
(LGA); World Health Organisation (WHO); National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE); Asso-
ciation for the Study of Obesity (ASO); National Obes-
ity Forum etc.
The full search strategy is available as Additional file 1.
Study selection
Titles and abstracts from electronic database searches
were transferred to EPPI-Reviewer 4 [12], and screened
against the inclusion criteria (Table 2). A random 20% of
titles and abstracts were screened by all the review team,
and once good agreement (80% or more) was reached,
the remaining 80% were allocated to a single reviewer.
Any queries were discussed within the review team and
if agreement could not be reached, were referred to the
local steering group for decisions. Records which poten-
tially met the inclusion criteria, including those found
on organisational websites, were retrieved in full and
assessed for inclusion.
Data extraction
Data were extracted from included articles by one re-
viewer into a piloted electronic form, and checked by
the lead reviewer. Queries were resolved as above. We
extracted data into the following fields: study details;
study design; setting; population (including PROGRESS-
Plus indicators [14]); public health or other issue;
intervention; comparator (if appropriate); outcomes;
findings; reviewer comments.
We also assessed all included studies against the ten
features for WSAs for obesity, in the working definition
prepared by Garside et al. for the NICE guidance [5].
Validity assessment
Two reviewers carried out validity assessment of in-
cluded articles using checklists developed for quanti-
tative and qualitative study designs of public health
interventions [15]. These were adapted from the Na-
tional Institute for Health and Care Excellence Public
Health methods guidance, and the Critical Skills Appraisal
Programme [16, 17]. Studies were given a quality rating
based on how many criteria they met on the appropriate
checklist.
Synthesis
Due to the substantial clinical and methodological het-
erogeneity of included studies, a narrative approach to
synthesis was chosen [18]. Evidence on health and non-
health outcomes is presented as a descriptive thematic
summary, grouped within each review question accord-
ing to whether it relates to obesity, other public health
or non-health issues, with the most methodologically ro-
bust evidence presented first.
We also looked at whether there was any association or
pattern between the direction of reported health effects
and the number of WSA features [5] that a study met,
using the cross-tabulation function in EPPI-reviewer and
carrying out a Fisher’s exact test in IBM SPSS 24 statistical
software.
Qualitative evidence on barriers and facilitators to im-
plementation and delivery of WSAs was summarised
using a framework synthesis approach, allowing themes
to emerge inductively from the included studies, within
the framework of ‘barriers’ and ‘facilitators’. The frame-
work was agreed within the review team, and data were
aggregated according to the major themes.
Results
Study selection process
Nine thousand seven hundred seventy-seven records
were screened at title and abstract stage, 860 were re-
trieved in full and a total of 65 articles were included in
the review [19–83]. Figure 1 depicts the study selection
process and Additional file 2: Table S1 presents key
characteristics of the included studies.
Description of included studies
Table 3 gives an overview of public health issues ad-
dressed by study design and country that the research
was carried out in. It is important to note that some
studies sought to address more than one issue and many
of the included studies were assessed as having more
than one study design, for example Copeland et al. [25]

 combined mixed method evaluation techniques with a
case control study nested within a prospective cohort
study. The majority of the evidence was from the USA
and Canada, though a substantial proportion also came
from the UK, and from the Global WHO Healthy Cities
network. Obesity and healthy lifestyle promotion were
the dominant public health issues tackled, along with al-
cohol, smoking and drugs.
Population
Forty-three studies included adults [19–22, 26, 32–36,
38, 39, 43–50, 52, 54–56, 58–66, 69–74, 78, 80, 81, 83]
and 51 included children [19–23, 25–27, 30–32, 34–36,
38–40, 42–48, 50–53, 55, 56, 58–65, 68–73, 76, 78–83].
Fourteen focused on areas of socioeconomic deprivation
[23, 44, 48, 50, 58, 61, 66, 68, 69, 73–76, 83] and ten on
people in black or minority ethnic groups [23, 40, 49, 50,
56, 57, 66, 74, 76, 83]. Nine studies specified that they
included older people [20, 22, 24, 34, 40, 45, 61, 66, 71].
Four studies targeted socially excluded groups [24, 66,
74, 75], two looked at women only [37, 74], two targeted
people with disabilities [24, 74] and one targeted a spe-
cific religious or cultural group [45].
Results of validity assessment
Quantitative studies
Methodological details were on the whole poorly reported.
Twenty of the 44 quantitative studies did not have a
comparator group. The comparator group was judged
to be appropriate in 14 of the remaining 24 studies,

Intervention
WSAs, defined as those that:
• Consider, in concert, the multifactorial drivers of overweight
and obesity, as outlined by Foresight [1], public health or the
social determinants of health [13];
• Involve transformative co-ordinated action (including policies,
strategies, practices) across a broad range of disciplines and
stakeholders, including partners outside traditional health sectors;
• Operate across all levels of governance, including the local level
so that such approaches are reinforced and sustained, and
• Identify and target opportunities throughout the life course
(from infancy to old age)
• Multiagency partnership working across sectors e.g.
health & social care, but not at more than one level;
case management initiatives focused on individuals or
individual families;
• Studies which looked at only one part of a WSA (i.e. one
specific intervention delivered as part of a wider approach).
Comparator
interventions
Any or none
Outcomes
Review questions 1 and 2:
• Health outcomes, e.g. weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), type 2
diabetes, diet and nutrition, physical activity, psychological
well-being & quality of life; co-morbidities related to obesity,
reductions in health inequalities, reductions in premature morbidity
and mortality, cardiovascular disease and obesity-related cancers.
• Organisational outcomes e.g. cross-sector collaboration; new
partnerships; environmental changes; resource allocation;
leadership etc.
• Process outcomes, e.g. what each project aimed to achieve and
barriers and facilitating factors associated with achieving or not
achieving those aims.
Outcomes may be at individual, local, regional or national/ federal/
principality level.
Review question 3
Process and implementation outcomes e.g. training, recruitment,
sustainability, people’s views on barriers and facilitators to
implementation of WSAs.
Review question 4:
Cost, cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit or cost-utility.
Study
designs
Review questions 1 and 2: primary research or evaluation studies.
These may be randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or non-RCTs,
natural experiments, before and after studies, or mixed methods
evaluations (including case study approaches).
Review question 3: process evaluations (qualitative or
mixed method studies).
Review question 4: cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit or
cost-utility studies.

 and in 10 studies there was judged to be baseline
equivalence between the groups. Eleven studies re-
ported
randomised
assignment
of
participants
to
groups. Fourteen studies allocated interventions at
the
right
level
(e.g.
cluster
randomisation
for
school-level interventions); ten studies did not report
sufficient information to judge allocation. Intention
to treat analysis was reported in two of the three
RCTs. The intervention was considered to have been
described adequately in almost all the studies (n =
39). Unbiased intervention delivery (i.e. intervention
and comparator groups treated the same, apart from
the
intervention)
was
reported
in
20
of
the
44
studies. The sample was judged to be representative
of the population in 17 of the included studies,
while in 28 studies the sample size was judged to be
large enough. Potential confounding factors were ad-
justed for in 11 studies. Due to the nature of the in-
terventions, blinded assignment to groups did not
occur
in
any
of
the
included
studies,
nor
was
blinded outcome assessment reported. Nine studies
reported on attrition rates. In 29 studies, the analysis
methods were judged to be appropriate, and a fur-
ther 14 studies did not provide enough detail about
the methods of analysis for the review team to assess
whether they were appropriate.

 Qualitative studies
Of the 30 studies with a qualitative design, the design
was judged to be appropriate in 28 studies, with the
remaining two providing insufficient detail. Seventeen
studies provided a clear statement of findings, six pro-
vided insufficient detail, and the remaining seven did not
provide a clear statement of findings. Fifteen studies used
appropriate strategies for data collection (and 13 did not
provide enough information), and 13 recruited partici-
pants appropriately (with 16 not providing enough infor-
mation). Seven studies undertook rigorous data analysis,
with three failing on this criterion and the remaining 20
providing insufficient information. Only three studies
showed evidence of reflexivity regarding the relationship
of the researcher to the participants, 18 failed on this cri-
terion and the remaining 9 did not provide enough infor-
mation. Nine studies provided enough information to
satisfy the review team that ethical issues had been consid-
ered, while 21 did not provide enough information.
Review question 1: What has been done in terms of a
WSA to obesity, and other complex public health
problems, and how effective have these been?
Studies meeting all ten guidance features for WSA
Thirteen included studies met all ten of the Garside et
al. [5] features for a WSA [25, 29, 39, 46, 47, 53, 64, 65,
67, 75–77, 80]. Five of these 13 studies reported health
or wellbeing outcomes [25, 29, 53, 75, 80], two reported
outcomes associated with the social determinants of
health [29, 80], and eleven reported process outcomes
[25, 29, 39, 46, 47, 64, 65, 75–77, 80]. Three of these
were UK initiatives, which all aimed to address obesity
and healthy lifestyle promotion: a poor to moderate
mixed methods evaluation of Change 4 Life [25], which
reported positive outcomes for social determinants of
health and mixed outcomes for health and wellbeing; a
poor quality before and after study of Health Heroes
[53], which reported positive health and wellbeing out-
comes, and a poor quality case study of Public Health
England’s paths to public health and wellbeing [65],
which reported on process outcomes. Of the remaining
10 articles, seven were about the WHO Healthy Cities
initiative [29, 39, 46, 47, 64, 67, 77] and all reported on
process outcomes only. One of these was of poor to
moderate quality [47], one was of moderate to good
quality [39], one was good quality [46],and the remaining
four were poor quality [29, 64, 67, 77]. The remaining
three articles were: a poor quality mixed methods
evaluation of the Central California Regional Obesity
Prevention Program [75], which reported positive health
outcomes; a poor quality case study of the San Diego
Healthy Weight Collaborative [76], which reported process
outcomes only, and a moderate to good quality ran-
domised controlled trial of “Communities mobilizing
for change on alcohol” [80], which also reported positive
health outcomes.
All included studies
The following sections briefly summarise the findings
of the included studies, with evidence of the highest
methodological quality presented first. For further details,
refer to Additional file 2: Table S1.
(a) Obesity
Positive effects on BMI and health behaviour were re-
ported in two good quality non-RCTs of Be Active Eat
Well (BAEW) in Australia, which met 7 out of the 10
WSA features [44, 69]; on BMI in a moderate to good
quality non-RCT of “Shape up Somerville” in the USA
[35], which met 8 out of the 10 NICE guidance features;
on parental health behaviour & awareness in a mixed
methods evaluation of moderate quality of the first year
of the UK social marketing initiative Change 4 Life
(C4L) [32], which met 8 out of the 10 WSA guidance
features; on fitness and obesity in a moderate quality
prospective cohort study of Healthy Living Cambridge
Kids [23] in the USA, which met 4 of the 10 WSA guid-
ance features; on BMI, parental awareness and commu-
nity capacity building in two moderate to poor quality
mixed methods evaluations of Romp and Chomp in
Australia, which met 9 out of the 10 WSA guidance
features [27, 31]; and on nutrition and physical activity
environments in an evaluation (of unclear design or
quality) of the Central California Regional Obesity
Prevention Program (CCROPP) [75], which met all 10
WSA guidance features.
Mixed effects on health and wellbeing outcomes,
with no reduction in obesity prevalence, were seen
in a moderate to poor quality nested case control
study of “Healthy Towns” in the UK [25], which met
all 10 of the WSA guidance features; and mixed ef-
fects were reported for obesity prevalence in a mod-
erate quality non-randomised trial of Travis County
CATCH in the USA [42], which met none of the 10
WSA guidance features.
A poor quality mixed methods evaluation of LIVE 5–
2–1-0 reported early indications of improvements in
community awareness and action to promote healthy
childhood behaviours, from stakeholder interviews.
(b) Other public health issues
Positive effects on underage drinking behaviour and
health, safety and wellbeing of community members
were reported in a moderate to good quality RCT of the
USA initiative Communities Mobilising for Change on
Alcohol (CMCA), which met all 10 WSA guidance
Bagnall et al. BMC Public Health            (2019) 19:8 
Page 7 of 14
 features [80]; on self-efficacy and intentions in a moder-
ate quality non-RCT of a community-based interven-
tion in Indigenous populations in the Canadian Arctic
[57], which met 9 out of the 10 WSA guidance features;
in smoking and tobacco-related disease outcomes in a
cross-sectional survey of moderate quality, and a before
and after study of poor quality, of the California To-
bacco Control Program (CTCP) [56, 63], which met 2
out of the 10 WSA guidance features; on smoking preva-
lence in a prospective cohort study of moderate to poor
quality [50] of the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to
Community Health (REACH) project, in the USA,
which met 8 out of the 10 NICE guidance features; in
healthy eating behaviour in a non-RCT of moderate to
poor quality of The Isfahan Healthy Heart programme
evaluation in Iran [59], that met 6 out of 10 WSA guid-
ance features; on smoking rates, home smoking bans
and support for smoke-free policies in a repeated
cross-sectional survey of poor quality of Put it Out
Rockland (PIOR) in the USA [51], which met 3 out
of the 10 WSA guidance features; and on access to
health and medical services for managing diabetes,
and access to fresh food in a poor quality case study
on community-based participatory diabetes preven-
tion [74], which met only one of the 10 WSA guid-
ance features.
Mixed health effects were reported on risk factors
for cardiovascular disease in a moderate quality pro-
spective cohort study of a community intervention
in the Netherlands [73], which met 7 of the 10 WSA
guidance features; and on BMI in a moderate to
poor quality non-RCT [43] of the Minnesota Heart
Health Programme (MHHP), which met 4 of the 10
WSA guidance features.
Review question 2: What elements of a WSA are effective
or not effective in (a) obesity (b) other areas of public
health (c) areas other than public health?
Studies of interventions which met a large number
(8–10)
of
the
WSA
guidance
features
frequently
reported positive health effects when looking at the
descriptive statistics (see Fig. 2 and Table 4). The
Fisher’s exact test determined that the association
between WSA feature categories (0–3 features, 4–7
features, or 8–10 features) and the health effects was
not
statistically
significant
(df
4,
chi-square
value
6.645, p = 0.094). All of the 10 individual WSA guid-
ance features were associated with positive health out-
comes (see Fig. 3) but the overall association was not
statistically significant (df 40, chi-square value 45.20,
p = 1.000). These statistical findings should be inter-
preted with caution given the small number and het-
erogeneous
nature
of
the
studies,
and
that
only
studies that reported on health outcomes could be in-
cluded in this analysis (34 out of a total of 65 studies
included in this review). Furthermore, only five of the
13 studies that met all 10 WSA guidance features re-
ported health outcomes; the remaining nine were
process evaluations and therefore not included in this
analysis.
Review question 3: What are the barriers and facilitators
to implementing a WSA in (a) obesity (b) other areas of
public health (c) areas other than public health?
Key themes that emerged from the included process
evaluations were as follows (with evidence of the
highest methodological quality which met 6 or more
of the WSA features (e.g. Healthy Cities) presented
first):

 1. Strong leadership and full engagement of all
partners is key for success: Senior leadership
buy-in was important to the effective development
and delivery of a number of initiatives [65, 77].
Evaluations of the Healthy Cities initiative [39, 22]
reported that effective organisational change required
core principles to be integrated into an organisation’s
mainstream activity, and recognised the need to have
a genuine consortium of partners who were actively
engaged rather than a single main driving force.
2. Engaging the local community is an important
component of a successful approach: Several
evaluations showed that projects were successful
because of effective community involvement in
identifying their needs and actively participating
in local solutions [47, 49–51, 57, 74, 75, 77, 80, 82].
Capacity building through coalitions, targeted
actions and community and system change were
also identified as important [49, 50].
3. Creating successful outcomes requires time to
build relationships, trust and community
capacity: Local authority action built up good
working relationships based on mutual trust,
shared vision, aims and values, which were of
central importance to developing and delivering
effective work. A Public Health England report
[65] suggested that where such partnerships were
not already in place, it was worth investing time
and effort to develop them.
4. Good governance and shared values:
Distinguishing features of the WHO European
Healthy Cities Network are shared vision and
values and an explicit commitment to good
governance by local councils and their executive
arms [29, 39]. The evaluations showed that the
emphasis on good governance resulted in better
participation, policy-making and intersectoral
action. This happened across the designated cities
and was not limited to a certain class (in terms
of population or geographical location) [28].
5. Appropriate partnerships are important to
create sustainable multilevel environmental
change: Building an effective and sustainable
collaborative team was found to be key [46, 65,
76, 83]. Identifying key stakeholders and securing
their early participation was considered important, as
was building an appropriate network of collaborators
[22, 27, 32, 65, 82]. Strong relationships between
stakeholders was identified as one of the factors
influencing effectiveness [62], whilst engaging
non-traditional partners can expand reach [51].
6. Consistency in language used across
organisations: The creation and use of a
common language can overcome the fact that
most organisations have their own beliefs and
structures, for example by using consistent and
authorised messages and materials, based on
insights gained through prior research in the
target community [32].
7. Embedding initiatives within a broader policy
context: It is important to ensure agendas focus
on the principles of what the organisations wish
to achieve, and to integrate or align initiatives so

 they are not seen as additional to mainstream
activity [39, 51].
8. Local evaluations: A number of studies reported
that local evaluations to inform effectiveness of
local level interventions from the outset were
important [25, 51, 62].
9. Sufficient financial support and resources:
Access to relevant resources, including funding,
was identified as important in several process
evaluations, and lack of resource was identified as
a barrier to successful implementation of WSAs
[27, 39, 46, 51, 62, 64, 65, 82, 83].
Review question 4: What is the evidence on cost-
effectiveness of WSAs in (a) obesity (b) other areas of
public health (c) areas other than public health?
We found very little evidence relating to cost effective-
ness of a WSA. Only one study, a cross-sectional survey
of moderate to poor quality of Put it Out Rockland [51],
reported an apparent cost-benefit comparison, although
the methods used were not clear: with an estimated re-
turn of $4 to $5 for every dollar spent on tobacco con-
trol, Rockland’s total $6 million investment between
2000 and 2010, added to the state’s investment, trans-
lated to a potential $24 million to $30 million savings in
tobacco- related costs for Rockland County. However
the cross-sectional study design means that conclusions
about impact cannot be drawn.
Discussion
Although 65 studies met the broad inclusion criteria, the
heterogeneity of studies in terms of different outcomes,
research designs, populations and interventions, pre-
vented the data from being analysed statistically. It is
also worth noting that most of the included studies did
not set out to implement or evaluate a WSA. Further-
more, reporting of intervention and approaches in pub-
lished articles was usually brief and lacked detail. This
underlines the lack of robust evidence in this area and
the need for further research to expand and support the
suggested associations, in order to increase our under-
standing of how WSAs can be implemented. Neverthe-
less, it does seem reasonable that programmes in a
community setting that adopt the principles of the ten
features identified by Garside et al. [5] such as develop-
ing relationships and engaging stakeholders, ensuring
the approach is robust and sustainable and having sup-
portive leadership, are more likely to be successful than
programmes that do not adopt these principles. Simi-
larly, it is also feasible that all ten of the features [5] are
associated with positive health effects, however in rela-
tion to current thinking around systems approaches,
these ten features do not comprehensively describe a
WSA.
The review also found consistent evidence from process
evaluations that ownership and commitment, strong rela-
tionships between stakeholders, and allowing sufficient
time to build relationships, trust and community capacity
are all key to building a successful WSA.
There is recognition in the literature that several
public health problems, including obesity, are complex
issues requiring system-based approaches [84, 85].
However, although the concepts and terminology have
existed for some decades the degree to which the field
has progressed is debatable, partly due to the multitude
of ways in which the language surrounding systems ap-
proaches is used.
Systems science “refers to a range of methods, com-
posed largely of mathematical or computational model-
ling and simulation, that enable the user to explore
complex problems by addressing both interactions be-
tween components of a system and the behaviour of the
system over time” [2]. On the one hand, there have been
significant advances in the application of a range of sys-
tems science approaches to a variety of obesity-related
public health issues using techniques such as micro-
simulation, social network analysis, agent-based model-
ling and system dynamics modelling. On the other hand,
Garside et al. (2010) reported that the term “whole sys-
tem approach” was found to represent approaches in-
formed by theory about complex systems which propose
new ways of organising, managing and evaluating activ-
ities, and also as terminology within a long list of
approaches which referred to cross-disciplinary, multi-
agency, multi-level community activities aimed at address-
ing health concerns affected by complex socio-economic
conditions [5] and which rarely, if ever, encompass the use
of the system science methods as described above.
Similarly to Garside et al. [5], this review found little evi-
dence of systems science or systems thinking in included
studies. Few programmes had been explicitly designed and
delivered with an a priori recognition of the public
health issue as a system and thus rarely approached im-
plementation from a perspective encapsulating a systems
approach – the implications of which are significant for
the reporting and evaluation of interventions. Further-
more, because interventions to date have not been under-
taken with a systems-thinking lens or set out to take a
WSA at the outset, there has been little recognition of
properties inherent in a complex system (e.g. nonlinear re-
lationships, feedback loops, dynamic interacting elements)
and little attention afforded to the reporting of the central
underlying operational mechanisms (e.g. improving net-
works, developing a common agenda, developing relation-
ships), as suggested by Allender et al. [86]. Hawe et al.
[85] noted that although the majority of health promotion
programmes claim to take an ecological approach, in real-
ity this is realised as multiple interventions at multiple
Bagnall et al. BMC Public Health            (2019) 19:8 
Page 10 of 14
 levels with “little theory put forward about how these levels
impact the unfolding of the intervention or how they affect
intervention outcomes”. Moreover, several authors have
noted that implementation of a suite of activities across
multiple-settings or multiple-levels is not necessarily the
same as taking a “systems approach” [5, 85, 87]. Systems
approaches focus on the context into which the interven-
tion is introduced [85] and relate to intervening directly
on the feedbacks, structures and goals of a system [87].
Considered in this light the evidence highlights the limited
progress that has been made in the practical implementa-
tion and evaluation of WSAs to public health issues to
date. What is needed a framework to incorporate the
complexity of systems approaches into public health re-
search, policy and practice [88].
Garside and colleagues in 2010 also looked for examples
of a whole system in action, finding only eight articles on
the effectiveness of community wide programmes display-
ing features of a WSA to prevent obesity, none of which
were undertaken in the UK and all of which targeted chil-
dren below 14 years of age [6]. Most findings favoured the
interventions but improvements were found to be small
and not always statistically significant. The inconclusive
evidence relating to the 10 NICE guidance features in the
present review may be because these emerged from a sys-
tematic review with the aim of providing a working defin-
ition of a WSA to obesity prevention, which did not find
any “authentic” WSAs, and the definition was therefore
widened to include those programmes that were designed
to work at multiple levels among multiple agencies in a lo-
cality [5]. So, meeting all ten of these criteria still does not
indicate an “authentic” WSA. In addition, although studies
may have met many or all of the 10 NICE guidance fea-
tures in their description of their proposed intervention,
in studies which presented effectiveness outcomes there
was little evidence of whether these interventions had
been implemented with fidelity to the WSA framework.
Limitations
Our search strategy was designed to look as widely as
possible to minimise the risks of missing valuable ma-
terial. Although 20% of titles and abstracts were double
screened, screening of the remaining 80% was limited
to a single reviewer, an “acceleration strategy” recom-
mended for rapid reviews [89]. While this was a prag-
matic necessity, it does potentially introduce bias and
human error, which may have resulted in some relevant
studies being missed.
Methodological details of included studies were, on
the whole, poorly reported, which limits our confidence
that the findings are not at significant risk of bias.
Only 11 of the included studies were UK-based, how-
ever their findings might be expected to be generalisable
to the UK context and three of these [32, 53, 65] met all
ten of the NICE criteria for a WSA.
Few studies targeted population groups known to be
at higher risk of obesity and other public health issues,
such as black and minority ethnic groups and people
with low levels of education or low socioeconomic sta-
tus. This limits the usefulness of the findings.
Thirteen of the 65 included studies were judged to
meet all ten of the criteria for a WSA proposed by Gar-
side et al. [5] in an earlier review. However, the hetero-
geneity of studies in terms of interventions, outcomes,
research designs, and populations prevented the data
from being analysed statistically.
Conclusions
Using a broad lens, this systematic review aimed to ob-
tain a greater insight on the effectiveness of WSAs and
how they can be implemented in practice. Evidence exists
to demonstrate promise with interventions working to-
wards systems approaches. This was most clearly demon-
strated through a suite of WHO Healthy Cities process
evaluations and evidence from whole of community ap-
proaches. A range of positive health outcomes were re-
ported, but there was little evidence of an association
between specific WSA features and health impacts. Evi-
dence of systems science and systems thinking was less
clear, even in the most “joined up” approaches, similar to
the findings of the series of reviews carried out for NICE
in 2010.
Recommendations
It is important to note that most of the included studies
did not report that they set out to implement or evaluate
a WSA, and reporting of interventions and approaches
in published articles was usually brief and lacked detail.
This underlines the lack of evidence in this area and the
need for further research. Whilst several learnings on
multi-level, community wide interventions have been
obtained which are likely to be relevant to the imple-
mentation of a true WSA (e.g. evidence about barriers
and facilitators to implementing such approaches), it is
also evident that evidence of how to operationalise a
whole systems approach to address public health prob-
lems is still in its infancy. We recommend that future
researchers and policy makers develop consistency in
language and an agreed definition of what a WSA should
be in relation to obesity. Future research studies into the
effectiveness of WSAs should look across sectors and
should include detailed descriptions of interventions
including
approaches,
and
embedded
process
and
economic evaluations, as recommended by existing
guidance on developing and evaluating complex inter-
ventions [90, 91].
