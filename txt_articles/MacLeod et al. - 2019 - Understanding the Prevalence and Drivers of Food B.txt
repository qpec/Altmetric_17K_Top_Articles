Abstract 
This article provides quantitative analysis of a self-reported measure of food bank use in the 
UK, adding to a sparse evidence base. Evidence from fifteen deprived communities in 
Glasgow is used to examine the scale of food bank use and to consider its relationship with 
socio-demographic, health, and financial variables.  Being affected by welfare reforms was 
found to increase the likelihood of food bank use. Young men and those with mental health 
problems were found to be more likely than others to have used a food bank.  Food banks 
appear to be used by groups who are being under-served by the welfare state and suffering 
the most acute impacts of austerity. The very low prevalence of food bank use among those 
who struggle to afford food points to their inadequacy as a response to food insecurity.  
Key words: food banks; welfare reform; food insecurity.

Introduction 
In response to the global financial crisis of 2008, the UK Government pursued an austerity 
agenda involving significant cuts to public services and reforms to the social security system. 
Austerity measures and welfare reforms have been implemented against a backdrop of 
stagnant incomes, rising unemployment, and increased costs of living. Recent analysis of the 
European Quality of Life Survey published in this journal found that food insecurity had risen 
across many European Countries since the crisis and that the UK and Ireland had 
experienced the sharpest post-2008 rise (Davis & Baumberg Geiger, 2016). In this context 
emergency food aid has greatly expanded as a reaction by church and charitable groups to 
the growing numbers of people struggling to afford enough food.  
The rapid growth of food banks in the UK over recent years has received considerable public 
attention and prompted much debate as to its causes (Lambie-Mumford, 2017). While the 
matter remains politically contested, there is a growing evidence base which links austerity 
measures and changes to the social security system – which include cuts to Housing Benefit, 
reassessments of disability benefit claims, reductions in tax credits for working families, and 
an overall benefit cap (Church Urban Fund, 2013) - to the rise in food bank use (Loopstra et 
al, 2015; Garrat et al., 2016; Dowler & Lambie-Mumford, 2015; Perry et al., 2014). Part of 
the challenge in seeking to engage policy makers on this issue is the lack of consistent, 
reliable data on the prevalence of food bank use in the UK, both in aggregate terms and 
among different social and client groups. This article addresses this gap by estimating the 
prevalence of food bank use by households living in deprived areas and comparing this to a 
measure of food insecurity.

Food insecurity and food bank use 
The rapid expansion of charitable food aid in the UK has stimulated particular interest in the 
issue of household food insecurity in the UK. Food insecurity is recognised as the inability to 
access adequate quality or sufficient quantity of food in socially acceptable ways, or the 
uncertainty that one will be able to do so (Radimer, 2002, also Dowler et al., 2001). The 
value of this definition is that it frames the issue as a social one and provides a multi-
dimensional conceptual framework for understanding it. Food insecurity is identified not 
only in relation to the quantity and quality of food one has access to, but also its 
psychological and social implications. One can be considered food insecure if one is not able 
to access food in ways which are common and acceptable in a society, such as “resorting, 
e.g. to emergency food supplies, scavenging, stealing and other coping strategies’’ 
(Anderson, 1990). The concept of ‘insecurity’ is also  helpful  in that it recognises the 
temporal nature and duration of the issue:   while someone may have sufficient food to feed 
themselves and their family today, they can be considered food insecure if they are anxious 
or uncertain about their future ability to do so.  The implication is that food bank use, whilst 
a result of acute food need, may not be a good indicator of the extent of food insecurity.  
Food insecurity is important because it is recognised as a potent indicator of material 
deprivation (Loopstra & Lalor, 2017). It captures the experience of having insufficient and 
insecure financial resources to meet one’s basic needs. Research evidence highlights the 
financial drivers of food insecurity. The ‘Food and You’ Survey in 2016 identified that adults 
in England, Wales and Northern Ireland with incomes in the bottom quartile and those who 
were unemployed or economically inactive were significantly more likely to be food 
  
4 
 
insecure (Bates, 2017). Analysis of survey data from countries where it is routinely 
monitored also shows low-income as a predictor of food insecurity (Che & Chen, 2001).  
 
Food bank use and food insecurity measurements 
Existing quantitative evidence on the scale and drivers of food bank use in the UK is largely 
reliant on data published by the Trussell Trust (TT), the biggest UK provider of food banks. 
They are a Christian organisation and operate a franchise model of food banking which 
currently number over 1235 centres (Trussell Trust 2017a). Their food banks provide parcels 
of non-perishable food which are accessed via a voucher referral system, issued by service 
providers including social workers and health care professionals. The most recent figures 
from the Trussell Trust report that they provided over 1.1 million food parcels in 2016-17 
across the UK. Of those 145,865 were in Scotland – a 9 per cent increase from the previous 
year (Trussell Trust 2017b). However, these figures do not reflect the true scale of food aid 
use. Other food banks exist, and vary in their scale and mode of operating:  some will allow 
self-referrals and others not; the size and number of parcels they will provide to an 
individual over a given period also varies. While it has been noted that the informal nature 
of much provision means it is difficult to comprehensively map services (Sosenko et al., 
2013), on-going research by the Independent Food Aid Network has so far identified over 
700 providers in the UK which are not members of the Trussell Trust.  
It is also important to note that TT figures reflect the number of parcels provided and are 
therefore not a measure of how many individuals are using food banks.  Indeed, Davis and 
Baumberg Geiger (2016) highlight  common concerns over the validity of food bank statistics 
  
5 
 
and the risk of errors such as double counting. While a good barometer of the growing issue 
of food bank use, reliance on TT data alone provides a limited picture of the prevalence of 
food bank use in the population. Furthermore, in the absence of a systematic measurement 
of household levels of food insecurity in the UK, available data on food bank use is often 
used uncritically as an indicator of the scale of the problem of food insecurity. Yet doing so 
is likely to underestimate the scale of food insecurity and mask problems of precariousness 
related to difficulties affording food (Lambie-Munford & Dowler, 2015).  
Analysis which draws on food insecurity data and food bank data in Canada has suggested 
that while food bank use tends to be indicative of food insecurity, non-use does not indicate 
an absence of food insecurity (Loopstra & Tarasuk, 2015: 240). Indeed, in Canada only 20-30 
per cent of food insecure households use food banks (Loopstra & Tarasuk, 2015), and 
studies have shown that food banks are most commonly used by those facing the most 
extreme level of food insecurity (Loopstra & Tarasuk, 2012). Recent UK research has also 
reported food bank use to be a strategy of last resort for people facing acute financial 
difficulties and that many experiencing food insecurity will not present at a food bank 
(Lambie-Mumford et al., 2014; Douglas et al., 2015). It has therefore been widely 
acknowledged that food bank use is an inadequate indicator of food insecurity (Loopstra & 
Tarasuk, 2015; Douglas et al., 2015). As discussed previously in this journal (Lambie-
Mumford & Dowler, 2015), there is a need to develop systematic measurement and 
monitoring of both food bank use and household food insecurity as separate but connected 
phenomena, in order to enable   “individual analyses of the causes and consequences of 
these experiences” (Loopsta et al., 2016: 9) .  
  
6 
 
In addition, reasons for non-use of food banks by those who might otherwise experience 
varying degrees of food need are worthy of further investigation. A study of food insecure 
households in Canada identified that most who did not use a food bank had chosen not to 
do so for reasons including the unsuitability of the food available, and the stigma associated 
with accessing such services (Loopstra & Tarasuk, 2012). Physical access barriers were less 
common reasons given for non-use. Until now there has been limited research  on non-use 
of food banks in the UK, and yet this requires better understanding if food insecurity is to be 
addressed effectively. 
 
Drivers of food bank use 
Several recent studies have sought to better understand the reasons for food bank use in 
the UK.  Such evidence highlights that food banks are used by people with a wide range of 
backgrounds, yet also consistently points to issues of delays and errors in the administration 
of social security payments, as well as the imposition of benefit sanctions, as common 
triggers for food bank use (Sosenko et al., 2013; Cooper et al., 2014; Lambie-Mumford & 
Dowler, 2015; Sims, 2016). Analysis of changes in food bank use across  local authority areas 
in England between 2009 and 2013 found that the highest levels of food bank use had 
occurred where there have been the highest rates of benefits sanctioning, unemployment, 
and cuts in central welfare spending (Loopstra et al., 2015). Further research has identified a 
robust, dynamic relationship between the number of sanctions applied and the number of 
adults receiving emergency food parcels (Loopstra et al., 2016).  
  
7 
 
Research carried out with food bank users found immediate income crisis, leaving a 
household with no or dramatically diminished income, to be a common trigger of food bank 
use (Perry et al. 2014). Identified causes of such crises included sudden life events such as 
bereavement or redundancy, yet the  operation of the benefit system was found to have 
been the most common cause (Perry et al., 2014).  Existing research therefore suggests key 
drivers of food bank use in the UK to be unemployment, the impact of welfare reforms 
(sanctioning in particular), and the experience of major life events. 
The relationship between food bank use and ill health has been identified as an important 
yet under-researched issue. Garthwaite et al. (2015) in their ethnographic study of food 
bank use in the North East of England found that people accessing a food bank often 
suffered from chronic health conditions and mental health problems. NHS Health Scotland 
research into food insecurity also raised concerns regarding the need to better understand 
the health implications of food bank use and the extent to which it might exacerbate 
existing chronic health conditions (Douglas et al. 2015). Both studies called for further 
research into the relationship between health and food bank use. 
While several case studies have  described food bank users, there has been little systematic 
data available in the UK which offers demographic details on those who access food banks. 
A recent survey of a representative sample of TT food bank users provides the first evidence 
to fill this gap, with  . the most common household type being single males, followed by 
lone mothers with children (Loopstra & Lalor 2017). The study also found that people with 
disabilities were over-represented among food bank users compared to the general 
population, and that mental health problems were particularly common – affecting 1 in 3 of 
the survey respondents (Loopstra & Lalor, 2017). Importantly, the study also examined 
  
8 
 
clients’ economic status and income sources. All households reported incomes well below 
the threshold of low income in the UK, and 78 per cent were found to be severely food 
insecure. Most food bank users in the study were in receipt of benefits (69.3 per cent), with 
Employment and Support Allowance (paid to people unable to work due to illness or 
disability) the most common source of income. The findings point to the financial 
vulnerability of benefit claimants, with 39 per cent of food bank users in the study waiting 
for a benefit decision or payment.  
 
The current study 
Our article builds on the previous examination of food bank users from within food banks by 
looking at food bank use as a self-reported measure within a wider study of deprived 
communities in a major UK city, Glasgow. It also goes beyond descriptive information to 
consider which health, financial and socio-demographic factors are associated with food 
bank use.    
This is important as existing evidence relies upon data provided by the Trussell Trust, which 
offers an incomplete picture of the scale of food bank use, limited information on the 
characteristics of those accessing food banks, and no assessment of the relationships 
between food bank use and key health and financial factors. Most existing evidence is 
qualitative and therefore able to identify factors and processes present among food bank 
users interviewed, but not the scale of use or the relative importance of those factors 
beyond the individuals. This article therefore focuses on the scale of food bank use in 
deprived neighbourhoods and offers three other important considerations.   
  
9 
 
First, it compares the scale of food bank use with the incidence of food affordability 
difficulties among households. While the survey was not initially designed to measure 
household food insecurity as it is defined above, given that the problem is recognised to be 
determined by lack of financial resources, the survey’s question on experiences of difficulty 
affording food was considered an adequate proxy indicator. 
Importantly, the survey also considers who is not using food banks - for reasons other than 
not needing to - so as to investigate the wider perceived relevance of food banks and 
highlight the issue of non-access amongst those who may be in need.  Lastly, the article 
examines the relationship between food bank use and a range of other factors, and assesses 
the relative importance of demographic, health and financial factors. In this way, the article  
contributes to the on-going debate as to the suitability of food banks as a response to food 
insecurity in the UK. 
 
Methods 
Research aims  
The aim of this research was to examine who uses food banks and why, or why not, among 
residents of deprived neighbourhoods.  The research questions being addressed are as 
follows: 
How prevalent is food bank use in deprived communities? 
How well does food bank use equate to those facing food insecurity? 
Which socio-demographic, personal, health and financial factors are associated with food 
bank use?

Study context 
Glasgow, as a UK city experiencing considerable deprivation, has been disproportionately 
affected by austerity compared with more prosperous parts of the country (Beatty & 
Fothergill 2014). Glasgow is Scotland’s largest city with a population of approximately 
600,000. This post-industrial city contains the largest share of deprived areas of any town or 
city in Scotland. According to the 2012 Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD), over 
one third of Glasgow’s residents live in areas which fall within the 10 per cent most deprived 
neighbourhoods in Scotland, and almost half live in the 20 per cent most deprived. 21.5 per 
cent of Glasgow’s population were income deprived in 2012, compared with the Scottish 
average of 13.4 per cent (Scottish Government, 2012a). As with other places which have 
been identified for research on food bank use (see Garthwaite et al 2015), Glasgow is also 
noted for its significant health inequalities, with a 15-year gap in life expectancy between 
residents of the richest and poorest parts of the city (McCartney, 2011).  
 
Study communities and data source 
The quantitative analysis presented in this article is based on data from interviews with 
householders conducted in 2015 as part of the Glasgow Community Health and Wellbeing 
Study (GoWell). This was the fourth wave of a household survey conducted across fifteen 
communities in Glasgow, each of which lie within the 15 per cent most deprived in Scotland 
(Scottish Government, 2012b).  The 2015 survey comprised a follow up survey at addresses 
randomly selected from the Postal Address File in previous survey waves and at which a 
  
11 
 
prior interview had been conducted; newly constructed dwellings in the study areas were 
also included in the survey (Egan et al., 2010).  The 2015 survey achieved a response rate of 
47 per cent (n=3,614), with the survey data weighted by age, gender and housing tenure so 
as to reflect the composition of the fifteen study communities and control for non-response 
bias. Non-participation in the survey, without weighting correction, is most likely among 
those with higher levels of education and in employment, although this group are relatively 
small in number in deprived areas.  For the first time the survey included a question on 
frequency of food bank use in the past year, with a follow up question on reasons for not 
having used a food bank. This provides a unique opportunity to examine the scale of food 
bank use, as a self-reported measure.  
 
Measure of food bank use 
In the 2015 survey, respondents were asked: ‘How often have you used a food bank, or 
similar service, in the last year?’ Response categories were: I have not used a food bank; at 
least weekly; about once or twice a month; less than once a month; don’t know; prefer not 
to say.  To those who answered that they had not used a food bank, a follow-up question 
was asked about the reasons for not using one: ‘Was that because you have not…needed to 
use a food bank; wanted to use a food bank; been able to use or access a food bank; don’t 
know; prefer not to say’.  
Respondents were classified into one of three groups depending upon their answers to 
these two questions.  
  
12 
 
• 
Food bank users are those who said that they had used a food bank in the last year 
(weekly; once or twice a month; or less than once a month).  
• 
Non-accessors are those who said that the reason they had not used a food bank 
was that they ‘had not wanted to use a food bank’ or ‘had not been able to use or access a 
food bank’.  
• 
Non-users are those who reported that they had not used a food bank in the past 
year and that the reason for this was that they ‘had not needed to use a food bank’. 
 
Independent variables  
Predictor variables of interest examined in this study included key socio-demographic 
variables including: gender; age; household type; housing tenure; citizenship status (as 
migrants have different access to welfare support than British citizens); and employment 
status.  The categories used for these variables are shown in Table 5 below. Other variables 
which have been shown in the literature to be important in relation to food bank use were 
also examined in terms of to life events, health and financial factors.  Survey respondents 
were asked whether they had experienced nine different life events in the past four years: a 
new job or promotion; unemployment, redundancy or reduced working hours; becoming a 
parent; serious health event; relationship break-up; bereavement; marriage or partnership; 
victim of a crime; moving home. 
In relation to their health, respondents were asked whether they had a problem of stress, 
anxiety or depression lasting twelve months or more. Elsewhere in the survey they were 
asked if they had spoken to a GP in the past twelve months about being anxious or 
  
13 
 
depressed or about a mental, nervous or emotional problem (including stress). A single 
variable for ‘mental health problems’ was constructed from these two questions where the 
presence of mental health problems was defined as an affirmative answer to either 
question.   General health was measured according to whether respondents indicated that 
in general their health was: excellent, very good, good, fair or poor.  Long-standing illness or 
disability is a binary variable based on responses to the yes/no question: “Do you have any 
longstanding illness, disability or infirmity?”  
To assess their level of financial difficulty in relation to different items, respondents were 
asked ‘How often do you find it difficult to meet the costs of the following things?: rent or 
mortgage; repairs, maintenance or factor charges for your home; gas, electricity or other 
fuel bills; food; council tax; clothes and shoes; accessing the internet; credit card or store 
card bills; purchase arrangements for white goods.  
In order to determine the extent to which a range of recent changes to the UK benefits and 
tax credit system have impacted respondents, they were asked: “Over the last four years, 
has your income been affected by any of these welfare reforms?  Under-Occupation 
Deduction (“Bedroom Tax”); Other Housing Benefit changes; Personal Independence 
Payment/Disability Living Allowance changes (PIP/DLA)1; Working Tax Credit changes; 
Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) changes; Benefit sanctions.” A summary variable 
was created denoting whether a respondent reported their income having been affected by 
none, one, or more than one of these reforms.  
 
Analysis 
  
14 
 
Initially the prevalence of food bank use was determined from the two main variables 
(frequency of food bank use, and reason for not using food banks).  Distinguishing ‘non 
accessors’ at this point and including this group in the next phase of the analysis enabled us 
to consider whether food bank users are a distinct group, and whether some of those who 
do not access food banks share characteristics with those who do. 
The relationships between food bank use and the range of independent variables were 
investigated using chi-square statistics, and the results presented in three groupings: socio-
demographic variables; health variables; and financial factors.   Those variables found to 
have a statistically significant association with food bank use were then included in the 
regression analysis.  In relation to affordability difficulties, food and fuel have been included 
in the analysis given that meeting the costs of these are identified in the literature as being a 
particular challenge among food bank users and the ‘heat or eat’ dilemma considered to be 
a key factor in causing people to turn to food banks (Lambie-Mumford and Snell, 2016).  To 
determine the relationship between food bank use and the independent variables of 
interest, a logistic regression model was developed in four stages. 
Using food bank use [user vs. non-user (combining non-accessors and non-users)] as the 
outcome variable, first key demographic variables were included as predictor variables: 
gender; age; and household structure. Given the small numbers involved in several of the 
age groupings, this variable was collapsed into a binary variable comparing those under and 
those over 40 which represents two similar sized groupings. Similarly, for household 
structure ‘older single adult’ was merged with ‘single adult’ and ‘older couple/multiple 
person’ with ‘couple/multiple person’. Second, to evaluate the potential relationship 
between health and food bank use, the presence of long-standing illness or disability; 
  
15 
 
mental health problems; and self-reported mental health were added to the model. Third, 
citizenship status; employment status; and experience of a number of different life events 
were added to the model. Finally, to determine the role of financial factors on food bank 
use, food affordability difficulties and fuel affordability difficulties [difficulty v no difficulty] 
were added, as well as a binary variable indicating whether or not a respondent’s income 
had been impacted by welfare reforms. All analyses were carried out using SPSS 22. 
 
Results 
Rate of food bank use 
Table 1 indicates the frequency of food bank use in the previous year as reported by the 
survey respondents, while Table 2 shows the reasons for non-use given by those who said 
they had never used a food bank. Using these findings, respondents are grouped into 
‘users’, ‘non-users’ and ‘non-accessors’ (as described above) in Table 3.  This shows that 4.2 
per cent of the survey respondents reported having used a food bank in the past year.   
While most people do not use a food bank because they say they do not need to use one, 3.8 
per cent of respondents reported not having used a food bank in the past year because they 
either did not want to, or were not able to do so. The majority of this ‘non-accessor’ group 
had elected not to do so – only 0.5 per cent reported that they had not used a food bank 
because they had not been able to use or access one (Table 2). 
 
  
16 
 
Comparing rates of food bank use from Table 3 with those of food affordability difficulties, 
presented in Table 4, 17.3 per cent of the survey respondents said that they occasionally, 
quite often or very often have difficulty meeting the cost of food.  Thus, the group of food 
bank users and non-accessors is approximately half the size of the group who report food 
insecurity on financial grounds. 
 
Socio-demographic characteristics of food bank users, non-accessors and non-users 
Table 5 shows the socio-demographic characteristics of respondents according to food bank 
use. Food bank use was found to be higher among men, younger age groups, single person 
households, social renters, refugee and asylum seekers, and those out of work.  
 
Life events and food bank use 
All of the life events, except for becoming a parent and a new marriage or partnership, 
showed associations with food bank use (based on chi-squared tests).  Table 6 shows the 
proportion of each group of food bank users who had also experienced life events. Food 
bank users were four times more likely to have been a victim of a crime that non-users, and 
three times more likely to have experienced a reduction in employment, including 
unemployment, redundancy or reduced working hours.  Approximately twice the proportion 
of food bank users (39.3 per cent) had experienced a serious health event, illness, or 
disability compared with non-users (19.4 per cent) and over twice as many food bank users 
as non-users had experienced relationship breakdown. 
  
17 
 
Almost half of food bank users (47.6 per cent) had moved home in the previous year, many 
more than the number of non-users and non-accessors who had done so.  This may be 
related to the fact that asylum seekers and refugees, who are concentrated in regeneration 
areas where house moves occur at a higher rate, are a group more likely to use food banks 
(see above), or simply due to the coincidence of poverty and home insecurity. 
Health and food bank use 
44.2 per cent of food bank users reported a longstanding illness or disability, compared with 
28.4 per cent of non-users and 42.1 of non-accessors. Two-thirds (66.4 per cent) of those 
who had used a food bank reported a mental health problem, compared with 31.6 per cent 
of non-users and 57.3 of non-accessors. 
Financial factors and food bank use 
Each of the welfare reforms included in the survey affected between 3.8 and 5.4 per cent of 
respondents.  Welfare reforms were far more common among  food bank users than non-
users (Table 8). Changes to Employment and Support Allowance, changes to housing 
benefit, and benefit sanctions are the most common welfare reforms experienced by those 
who report food bank use.  A high proportion (22.1 per cent) of non-accessors, i.e. people 
who said they did not want to use a food bank or had not been able to, had also 
experienced a benefit sanction. The stigma of food banks may be a barrier to use in these 
cases (Garthwaite, 2016; Purdnam et al., 2015).  
Table 9 shows the rate of food bank use according to the number of welfare reforms 
respondents reported having been affected by. Whilst only 5.3 per cent of those not 
affected by welfare reforms were either food bank users or non-accessors, 18.2 per cent of 
  
18 
 
those affected by one welfare reform were either accessing or not able to access a food 
banks, rising to 29.9 per cent of those affected to two or more welfare reforms.   Thus, 
where multiple welfare reforms affected a household, the likelihood of food bank use was 
higher.  
In terms of financial difficulties, difficulty affording each of the items included in the survey, 
with the exception of household repairs, had a significant relationship with food bank use 
(p<0.01). Among food bank users, affording clothes was the most common financial 
difficulty reported by two-thirds of users (67.4 per cent) followed by fuel (61.8 per cent) and 
food (61.4 per cent). Moreover, only 15.3 per cent of those reporting difficulty affording 
food had used a food bank. Among those who report frequent difficulty2 affording food (7 
per cent of respondents), 22.6 per cent had used a food bank and 13 per cent had not used 
one because they had not wanted to or had not been able to do so. 
This descriptive analysis of the survey data has identified associations between food bank 
use and a number of socio-demographic; health; and financial variables. Particularly striking 
is the relationship with ill health, and the high prevalence of mental health problems among 
food bank users. In many instances, the characteristics of non-accessors lie somewhere 
between those of non-users and users, though more often closer to the latter than the 
former. 
While these findings are helpful for understanding the common characteristics of food bank 
users, many of the factors described above may be interconnected. Further analysis used 
logistic regression to control for other factors when examining the impact of independent 
variables on food bank use.  To address issues of multi-collinearity the logistic regression 
analyses were undertaken in blocks. 
  
19 
 
Regression results:  predictors of food bank use 
Table 11 shows the results of the logistic regression for food bank use.   After controlling for 
all other variables women were less likely (OR 0.546, 0.336-0.885) than men to have used a 
food bank. Similarly, those over 40 were less likely than those under 40 to have used a food 
bank (OR 0.601, 0.369-0.981) after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, as well 
as health and financial variables. The profile of food bank users is likely to be in part due to 
the protective impact of retirement on incomes – pensioners have not been adversely 
affected by welfare reforms (Mason, 2016) and are not as vulnerable to disruptions to their 
income such as sanctioning as those claiming other forms of social security.  Household 
structure and citizenship status did not have a significant relationship with food bank use, 
once other factors were controlled for.  
Self-reported general health was associated with food bank use, with those with worse 
health more likely to use a food bank (OR 1.321, 1.076-1.622), but this association became 
weaker upon inclusion of financial variables.  Having a long-standing illness or disability did 
not have a significant relationship with food bank use.   Those with a mental health problem 
were over three times more likely to have used a food bank than others, the odds falling to 
a little under twice as likely upon the inclusion of life events, status and financial variables in 
the model (OR 1.845, 1.113-3.058).  Those of working age who were not working and those 
who classified themselves as long-term sick or disabled were several times more likely to 
have used a food bank than those in full-time work (OR 5.626, 2.359-13.417  and OR 3.086, 
1.096-8.690), respectively).   Similarly, those who had lost their job were twice as likely to 
have used a food bank as others (OR 2.012, 1.214-3.337), with this effect attenuated by the 
inclusion of financial factors in the model.   The only other life event bearing a significant 
  
20 
 
association with food bank use was moving home, (OR 1.765, 1.115-2.794).  Having difficulty 
affording food, and having been affected by welfare reforms approximately doubled the 
odds of someone having used a food bank, all other factors considered (OR 2.242, 1.246-
4.035 and 2.293, 1.459-3.604, respectively)

Discussion 
Our findings from a survey of deprived neighbourhoods in Glasgow found that one-in-
twenty-five participant households had used a food bank in the past year. A similar sized 
group identified as non-accessors, who reported not having used a food bank for reasons 
other than not needing to. The findings also highlight the very low prevalence of food bank 
use among those who struggle to afford food. A little over  one-in-six of those who had 
experienced difficulty paying for food had used a food bank, including less than a quarter of 
those who frequently struggle to afford food.  These results challenge perceptions that food 
banks are a ready and utilised resource by those unable to afford sufficient food.  
These findings also build on existing evidence from the UK and elsewhere which suggests 
that food bank use is a strategy of last resort.  The majority of the ‘non-accessors’ group in 
this study had chosen not to use a food bank, as opposed to being unable to do so, possibly 
due to perceptions of stigma and unsuitability of the food (Loopstra & Tarasuk, 2012). 
Comparison of the characteristics across the three groups (non-users, non-accessors, and 
non-users) suggests that there are similarities between food bank users and non-accessors 
but that the former group may face greater difficulties (for example while a third of non-
accessors had been affected by welfare reforms, this was the case for almost half of food 
bank users). This result appears to confirm suggestions elsewhere that food banks are 
avoided other than in cases of extreme need.  Indeed, a quantitative study of food bank use 
among food insecure households in Toronto, Canada found that while choosing not to use a 
food bank was the most common reason for non-use among those with lower levels of food 
insecurity,  those with most severe food insecurity were far more likely than others to 
report barriers to accessing food banks as their reason for non-use (Loopstra & Tarasuk, 
  
22 
 
2012). The results of our study therefore develop the UK evidence of resistance to food 
bank use among residents of deprived communities, further challenging the argument that 
food bank use is supply-driven (Williams, 2013), and questioning the appropriateness of 
food banks as a policy response to food insecurity.  
We found rates of food bank use to be highest among single people compared with other 
household types.  This finding is consistent with evidence from Citizens Advice Scotland, 
where 60 per cent of clients given advice about food banks are single adults and 26 per cent 
are families with dependent children (Sims, 2016).  Similarly, a recent representative survey 
of TT food bank users found single male households to be the most common household 
type (Loopstra & Lalor, 2017). The large proportion of single adults among food bank users 
is potentially due to the lack of variety of income sources available to someone living alone, 
who is therefore more vulnerable to changes in income, resulting in acute income crises.  A 
lack of family or social support could also be a reason for greater food bank use among 
those living alone.  
Binary logistic regression modelling sought to identify the characteristics which are 
significantly associated with food bank use, after controlling for other variables. A striking 
finding is the role of mental health, whereby mental ill health was associated with food bank 
use after controlling for employment status, difficulty affording food and fuel, and impact of 
welfare reforms. Our analysis confirms a suggested relationship between poor health (poor 
mental health particularly) and food bank use (Garthwaite et al., 2015). While it is not 
possible through our data to determine the direction of the relationship between food bank 
use and mental ill health, the appropriateness of food banks as a response to food 
insecurity, particularly for those with mental health and other conditions, is called into 
  
23 
 
question, given the stigma of food bank use reported elsewhere (Garthwaite, 2016; 
Purdnam et al., 2016). The extent to which food bank use might exacerbate existing health 
conditions has been identified as a potential issue of concern particularly in relation to 
nutritional needs and physical health (Douglas et al., 2015), but our study also raises the 
possibility of negative effects of food bank use upon mental health and this requires further 
research.   Given widely reported cuts to mental health services during the recent period of 
austerity (BMA, 2017), it also raises questions about the level and suitability of care being 
provided for those with mental health conditions.  
We found that being male and being younger than 40 increased the odds of food bank use, 
independent of other socio-demographic and financial factors. These results build on 
findings from a recent study by Citizens Advice Scotland which identified that clients seeking 
advice on food banks were more likely to be male (63 per cent) and younger than the 
average client (average age was 41 for those seeking food bank advice) (Sims, 2016).  This 
demographic has also been identified as having been disproportionately affected by benefit 
sanctions in Scotland (Scottish Government, 2014).  Whilst our basic analysis showed that 
crude rates of food bank use and non-access were similar between those in their 30s, 40s 
and early 50s, the rate of use dropped among those aged mid-50s or older.  In addition, as 
noted earlier, pensioners have been largely protected from the kind of income crises caused 
by operations of the benefits system which often prompts food bank referrals.  
The relationship between major life events and food bank use suggests the complex 
challenges which people face, and the often traumatic experiences, such as bereavement, 
which may compound existing issues and lead to crises (Perry et al., 2014). In particular, our 
analysis found that having moved house in the past year almost double the odds of food 
  
24 
 
bank use. This is likely to be because of the financial costs associated with moving and 
settling into a new home, and the impact of moving on other areas of household budgets 
for people on very low incomes.  
The relationship between recent welfare reforms and food bank use identified in the study 
is particularly striking, with those impacted by the reforms being more than twice as likely 
to have used a food bank as other people in deprived areas.  The vulnerability of those out 
of work due to long-term illness or disability to food bank use, a group historically better 
protected by the social security system, is perhaps also indicative of the extent to which the 
roll-back of the safety net function of the welfare state for this group is having detrimental 
impacts on food security. These findings echo those of Loopstra and Lalor’s (2017) study of 
TT food bank clients which found that most Employment and Support Allowance claimants 
among food bank users were in, a group more likely to have experienced a benefit change 
following a work capability assessment, and now subject to increased welfare conditionality.   
Limitations 
Our self-report measure of food banks use is a useful alternative to counts of food parcels, 
but it is also limited in that it relies on recall and may be open to under-reporting because of 
stigma or social desirability bias – people may not report food bank use. The survey is also 
limited because the financial variables are asked for at a point in time which may not 
coincide with the food bank use so some of our comparisons may be affected.  In addition, 
we cannot make claims about the prevalence of food bank use in the population as a whole 
as the survey is concentrated in deprived communities, likely to be experiencing higher 
levels of need.

Conclusion  
The low rates of food bank use among those who report difficulty affording food and the 
extent of resistance to food bank use offer an important challenge to presumptions that 
food banks are an appropriate and utilised response to food insecurity. It is concerning that 
problems of food insecurity are much greater than the figures on  increasing food bank 
usage would suggest. This finding warrants further investigation of the interface between 
food insecurity and food bank use. There is a need for systematic measurement and 
monitoring of both food insecurity and food bank use in the UK in order that this wider issue 
might be better understood.  
The strength of the association between mental health problems and food bank use should 
be of particular concern to policy makers and practitioners, raising questions as to the 
adequacy of mental health services available to people facing destitution, thus expanding 
existing concerns about the ability of mental health services to cope with those in crisis 
(Care Quality Commission, 2015). The findings also suggest that the difficulties people face 
which lead to food bank use may extend beyond the financial to other aspects of wellbeing 
and associated support service requirements.  The associations with life events add further 
weight to the argument that those using food banks are living in precarious conditions and 
that food banks may be a last resort, rather than a solution to rising issues of food 
insecurity.   
These results highlight areas for policy attention with a view to the development of 
preventative and supportive policy and practice responses for public health gain (Eyler et al., 
  
26 
 
2016).  Further research is required to better understand the role of food bank use within 
the experience of household-level food insecurity. Finally, given the relationship between 
welfare reforms and food bank use identified in this and other studies (Loopstra et al., 2015; 
Perry et al., 2014), the ways in which charitable food aid might be challenging and changing 
the nature and purpose of the welfare state also requires further investigation.
