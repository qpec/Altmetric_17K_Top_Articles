Background. Most Lyme disease cases in the Midwestern United States are reported in Minnesota and Wisconsin. In recent years, 
however, a widening geographic extent of Lyme disease has been noted with evidence of expansion eastwards into Michigan and 
neighboring states with historically low incidence rates.
Methods. We collected confirmed and probable cases of Lyme disease from 2000 through 2014 from the Michigan Department 
of Health and Human Services, entering them in a geographic information system. We performed spatial focal cluster analyses to 
characterize Lyme disease expansion. We compared the distribution of human cases with recent Ixodes scapularis tick distribution 
studies.
Results. Lyme disease cases in both the Upper and Lower Peninsulas of Michigan expanded more than 5-fold over the study 
period. Although increases were seen throughout the Upper Peninsula, the Lower Peninsula particularly expanded along the Indiana 
border north along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan. Human cases corresponded to a simultaneous expansion in established I 
scapularis tick populations.
Conclusions. The geographic distribution of Lyme disease cases significantly expanded in Michigan between 2000 and 2014, 
particularly northward along the Lake Michigan shore. If such dynamic trends continue, Michigan—and possibly neighboring areas 
of Indiana, Ohio, and Ontario, Canada—can expect a continued increase in Lyme disease cases.
Keywords.  Borrelia burgdorferi; Ixodes scapularis; Lyme disease; Michigan; geographic information systems.
Lyme disease is a multisystem bacterial infection caused by 
Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted by Ixodes species ticks. With 
approximately 30 000 reported cases and an estimated 300 000 
cases per year, it is the most common vector-borne infectious 
disease in the United States [1, 2]. Approximately 90% of all con-
firmed cases in the United States are acquired along the northeast 
coast, with most of the remainder in Minnesota and Wisconsin. 
Between these eastern and Midwestern foci, locally acquired 
Lyme disease has been comparatively rare. Michigan has a histor-
ically low incidence of Lyme disease compared with neighboring 
Wisconsin, particularly in the Lower Peninsula of the state. This 
paucity of cases is corroborated by acarological studies between 
1985 and 2006, demonstrating the rarity of B burgdorferi-infected 
Ixodes scapularis ticks in Michigan’s Lower Peninsula [3, 4].
Recent epidemiologic and entomologic surveillance from 
2000 to 2014 have revealed an overall increase in Lyme disease 
cases in Michigan, including the emergence of the disease in 
the Lower Peninsula. In this study, we report the results of 
spatial and spatiotemporal analyses of Lyme disease case data 
from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services 
(MDHHS) over this period, indicating that the expanding dis-
tribution of human cases is geographically concordant with 
expansion of I scapularis populations in Michigan.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was exempted from institutional review board (IRB) 
review by the Duke University Human Subjects Committee, 
and the protocol was approved by the MDHHS IRB.
Data Sources
Human case data were made available by data use agreement with 
the MDHHS. The MDHHS provided case records of probable and 
confirmed Lyme disease cases from 2000 through 2014. These cases 
were aggregated by zip code according to each patient’s address of 
residence. In addition, MDHHS also provided annual aggregate 
data on the county of Lyme disease exposure. These exposure 
data were collected by interview from patients. Spatial data layers 
included zip code centroid points, zip code polygons, and county 
polygons; these layers included United States Census data (eg, 2010 
census population and population per square mile). These were 
obtained through esri (Redlands, CA) online data services.

Case Definitions
Cases of Lyme disease were classified by the MDHHS according 
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sur-
veillance definitions. Three case definitions were active during 
this period: the 1996 definition (for 2000–2007 cases), the 2008 
definition (for 2008–2010 cases), and the 2011 definition (for 
2011–2013 cases) [5–7]. Until 2008, the CDC only classified 
cases as “confirmed”; the subsequent definitions have classified 
cases as “suspected,” “probable,” or confirmed. For this study, 
we pooled probable and confirmed cases, but we excluded sus-
pected cases.
Ixodes scapularis Distribution
To document the expansion of I scapularis in Michigan during 
the period of interest, field reports on these ticks were collated 
and used to map counties where this species was detected in 
2001, 2007, and 2014. The 2001 and 2007 datasets were based 
on the county status reported in Dennis et al [8], supplemented 
by the results of additional field reports undertaken since that 
publication. The 2014 dataset was based on field reports col-
lated by Eisen et al [9]. The Dennis et al [8] county records were 
obtained from published reports, unpublished reports by CDC 
and other experts, the US National Tick Collection database 
[10], and questionnaire surveys sent to public health officials, 
acarologists, and Lyme disease researchers. Ixodes scapularis 
was categorized as “reported” in a Michigan county if at least 
1 tick of any life stage had been found there; and I scapularis 
populations were categorized as “established” if at least 6 indi-
viduals or 2 life stages had been found within 1 year.
From the late 1990s until the present, Michigan State 
University (MSU) and MDHHS field teams undertook 5 field 
surveys for I scapularis populations in various counties. The 
most common survey method was to collect questing adult 
ticks in the spring or fall, by “dragging” a 1-m2 corduroy cloth 
through vegetation transects [11]. Each tick was identified to 
species, life stage, and sex using dichotomous keys [12, 13]. 
Surveys undertaken before 2008 were used to identify Michigan 
counties that had changed status since 1998. Surveys under-
taken from 2008 onwards were used to make equivalent updates 
to the maps in Eisen et al [9] (described below).
In 2016, Eisen et al [9] updated the Dennis et al [8] data-
base by collating studies published since the original, by visiting 
individual state health department web sites to identify coun-
ty-level tick surveillance data, and by recontacting public health 
officials, acarologists, and Lyme disease investigators who had 
information on ticks in Michigan. The surveys by MSU and 
MDHHS, described above, provided much of the new Michigan 
data reported by Eisen et al [9]. If a county had been classified 
as established at a prior time point, it retained this designation 
in the 2007 and 2014 classifications, unless more recent collec-
tion records changed that county’s classification from reported 
to established.
Geoprocessing
We used ArcGIS 10.3.1 (ESRI, Redlands, CA) for all geopro-
cessing operations. We appended case data to a zip code pol-
ygon and county polygon layers in ArcGIS, using 5-digit zip 
code and county name as common fields, respectively. We used 
cartographic and layout features in ArcGIS to produce all map 
figures in this paper.
Spatial Cluster Analysis
We performed a focal cluster analysis using the spatial scan-
ning statistic in SaTScan (www.satscan.org) [14]. SaTScan uses 
circular scanning windows, comparing case counts to popula-
tion values, to identify areas where observed numbers of cases 
exceed those expected under a Poisson distribution. The advan-
tage of this technique is it inherently accounts for geographic 
heterogeneity in the underlying population at risk. Our analysis 
parameters specified a maximum spatial cluster size up to 5% 
of the population at risk, and to limit overlapping clusters we 
did not allow cluster centers to fall within other clusters. We 
performed our analysis for 3 intervals of 5 years: 2000–2004, 
2005–2009, and 2010–2014. We analyzed the Upper and Lower 
Peninsulas of Michigan separately because of their spatial 
discontinuity. Population figures were obtained from 2010 
United States Census data. We retained only clusters with a P 
value below 0.01. The circular clusters were then geometrically 
clipped to the boundaries of underlying zip code areas in order 
that the cluster shape conform to the underlying geography. We 
removed from the clusters any zip code in which there had been 
no Lyme disease cases during that 5-year interval.
RESULTS
Between 2000 and 2014, there were 1057 confirmed and probable 
cases of Lyme disease reported by the MDHHS; 1045 of these 
could be mapped to zip codes. Of these, 612 cases were from res-
idents of the Lower Peninsula and 433 from the Upper Peninsula. 
There were fewer than 30 Lyme disease cases reported in Michigan 
in any year between 2000 and 2004 (Figure 1). Notwithstanding 
some year-to-year variation, the total case count began expand-
ing in 2005; by 2009, the case count surpassed 90, and in 2013 
there were 166 cases. This increase in case volume occurred 
simultaneously in both the Upper and Lower Peninsulas.
From 2000 to 2004, there were 108 total Lyme disease cases 
reported statewide. The heaviest single concentration occurred 
in the Upper Peninsula, with 27 total cases in the southern part 
of Menominee County (Figure 2A). During these 5 years, no sig-
nificant concentration of cases was seen in the Lower Peninsula. 
Only a single zip code in Ann Arbor recorded more than 2 total 
cases between 2000 and 2004. However, this pattern changed 
in the subsequent 5 years. The primary concentration of Lyme 
disease cases in the Upper Peninsula expanded into neighbor-
ing Dickinson and Delta Counties, and a second concentra-
tion appeared in Gogebic County along the western border

with Wisconsin. At the same time, cases began to accumulate 
in the southwestern Lower Peninsula near the border with 
Indiana and along the Lake Michigan shore. This was true for 
population-weighted maps of cases mapped by residential zip 
code (Figure 2A) and for cases mapped by county of exposure 
(Figure 2B). Cases were more scattered elsewhere in the Lower 
Peninsula, particularly in urban centers such as Ann Arbor and 
Grand Rapids. The next 5-year interval, between 2010 and 2014, 
saw further extension of transmission in the Upper Peninsula, 
particularly along the Lake Superior coast. Cases in the Lower 
Peninsula accumulated farther north along the Lake Michigan 
coast during these years. The county of acquisition (Figure 2B) 
bore a close geographic resemblance to our cluster analysis in 
Figure 2A.
In 1998, Dennis et al [8] indicated that I scapularis had 
been reported from 22 Michigan counties and was established 
in 5 (only 1 of which was in the Lower Peninsula; Figure 3). 
By 2007, 7 additional counties (all in the Lower Peninsula) 
were known to have established populations, and 4 additional 
counties had reported ticks. By 2016, the totals had increased 
to 24 counties with established populations and an additional 
18 with reports of ticks. This expansion of tick populations is 
geographically concordant with the expanding distribution of 
human cases.

DISCUSSION
From 2000 through 2014, Michigan saw both a numerical and 
geographic expansion of its total Lyme disease case volume. 
Early during this period, Lyme disease cases were largely con-
fined to 1 county in the Upper Peninsula bordering Wisconsin. 
In the subsequent years, the endemic range expanded within 
the Upper Peninsula. At the same time, cases began to emerge 
in the Lower Peninsula along the Lake Michigan shore and the 
Indiana border and subsequently extended farther northward 
and inland.
Standard case reporting for Lyme disease records location of 
patient residence, and this may differ from location of exposure. 
As a consequence, Lyme disease cases were identified in pop-
ulous areas, such as Ann Arbor and Grand Rapids. However, 
our cluster analyses were adjusted for the underlying popula-
tion distribution, allowing us to highlight regions where the 
observed cases exceeded expectation. This analysis closely cor-
roborated the subset of cases in which the location of exposure 
was known.
In the Upper Midwestern United States, I scapularis popula-
tions have been reported throughout Wisconsin and Minnesota 
since the late 1960s and have since expanded [8, 9]. In Michigan, 
initial passive and active surveillance suggested that the only 
established population of blacklegged ticks was in Menominee 
County in the western Upper Peninsula [8], although there had 
been sporadic reports of I scapularis ticks on humans and dogs 
in many other counties since the late 1980s [4].
By applying a blacklegged tick habitat suitability model 
developed in Wisconsin to Michigan’s landscape, Foster [15] 
made the first detections of established populations of I scap-
ularis in southwestern Lower Peninsula Michigan. A multiyear 
surveillance (2004–2009) documented progressive northward 
spread of I scapularis populations along the coast of Lake 
Michigan, but less so at inland sites [16]. Blacklegged ticks had 
become established at 3 of 4 inland sites by 2010 [17] and at all 
4 inland sites by 2014 [9]. Borrelia burgdorferi has been detected 
in ticks at sites in the Upper Peninsula [4, 16, 17], western coastal 
Lower Peninsula sites [15–17], and inland Lower Peninsula sites 
(J. T., unpublished data, 2014). The spread of blacklegged ticks 
across the Lower Peninsula of Michigan supports predictions of 
a recent spatial study mapping the environmental risk of Lyme 
disease [3, 18].
Our study is primarily limited by challenges and biases in 
current Lyme disease surveillance. Physicians report only a 
small minority of Lyme disease cases, perhaps as little as 10% in 
some states, and underreporting is most likely not spatially uni-
form. On the other hand, surveillance definitions leave room 
for false-positive misclassification of cases due to a variety of 
factors. Finally, the ability of a state public health program to 
address these biases can be strongly influenced by resource allo-
cation and labor.
CONCLUSIONS
Although we acknowledge these limitations, our approach uses 
data from more than 1000 Lyme disease cases over a 15-year 
period. These data illustrate (1) a trend of northeastward expan-
sion around the shore of Lake Michigan into the Lower Peninsula 
of Michigan as well as (2) expansion within the Upper Peninsula. 
These trends are consistent with both national and local trends 
demonstrating expansion of the endemic range for Lyme disease 
in other geographic regions. These trends are also supported 
by recent expansion in the national distribution of seropositive

and biological factors that have facilitated spread of this tick and 
pathogen nor which factors may ultimately constrain it. In the 
meantime, further study is needed to optimize both ecological 
and case surveillance methods to best understand these changes 
in geographic range of this common disease.
