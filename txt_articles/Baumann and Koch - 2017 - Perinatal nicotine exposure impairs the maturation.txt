Key points
r Chronic perinatal nicotine exposure causes abnormal auditory brainstem responses and
auditory processing deficits in children and animal models.
r The effect of perinatal nicotine exposure on synaptic maturation in the auditory brainstem
was investigated in granule cells in the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, which receive a
single calyx-like input from the cochlear nucleus.
r Perinatal nicotine exposure caused a massive reduction in the amplitude of the excitatory input
current.
r This caused a profound decrease in the number and temporal precision of spikes in these
neurons.
r Perinatal nicotine exposure delayed the developmental downregulation of functional nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors on these neurons.
Abstract Maternal smoking causes chronic nicotine exposure during early development and
results in auditory processing deficits including delayed speech development and learning
difficulties. Using a mouse model of chronic, perinatal nicotine exposure we explored to what
extent synaptic inputs to granule cells in the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus are affected
by developmental nicotine treatment. These neurons receive one large calyx-like input from
octopus cells in the cochlear nucleus and play a role in sound pattern analysis, including speech
sounds. In addition, they exhibit high levels of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, especially
during early development. Our whole-cell patch-clamp experiments show that perinatal nicotine
exposure causes a profound reduction in synaptic input amplitude. In contrast, the number
of inputs innervating each neuron and synaptic release properties of this calyx-like synapse
remained unaltered. Spike number and spiking precision in response to synaptic stimulation
were greatly diminished, especially for later stimuli during a stimulus train. Moreover, chronic
nicotine exposure delayed the developmental downregulation of functional nicotinic acetyl-
choline receptors on these neurons, indicating a direct action of nicotine in this brain area. This
presumably direct effect of perinatal nicotine exposure on synaptic maturation in the auditory
brainstem might be one of the underlying causes for auditory processing difficulties in children
of heavy smoking mothers.

Introduction
Maternal smoking during pregnancy causes auditory
processing deficits in babies and children throughout
adolescence resulting in difficulties in speech perception
and learning (McCartney et al. 1994). Perinatally
nicotine exposed newborns and babies exhibit decreased
orientation behaviour in response to auditory stimuli and
distorted auditory brainstem responses (Key et al. 2007;
Kable et al. 2009; Peck et al. 2010). Similarly, auditory
processing deficits have been observed in neonatally
nicotine exposed rats (Sun et al. 2008). Although
millions of children are affected by nicotine exposure
during embryonic development, the question how brain
circuits in the ascending auditory pathway are altered by
it has received little attention.
Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), the main
binding site of nicotine, are present throughout the
ascending auditory pathway. Functional nAChRs mostly
of the α9 and α10 subtype are expressed around birth
on inner and outer hair cells and on the descending
olivocochlear fibres to the hair cells of the inner ear
(Roux et al. 2011; Simmons & Morley, 2011), where
they promote synaptic maturation and stabilization
during early development (Vetter et al. 1999; Murthy
et al. 2009). Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors also exist
throughout the auditory brainstem, midbrain and cortex.
Particularly during early pre- and postnatal development
the highly Ca2+ permeable α7 nAChR subtype is expressed
throughout the ascending auditory pathway (Happe &
Morley, 2004). This receptor subtype has been implicated
in the maturation of neural circuits during early brain
development (Liu et al. 2007). During this period post-
synaptic α7 nAChR activity leads to glutamate receptor
accumulation and stabilization in the membrane (Lozada
et al. 2012; Halff et al. 2014) thereby contributing to map
formation (Morishita et al. 2010).
The ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL),
an auditory brainstem nucleus which faithfully encodes
the temporal pattern of sounds, contains one of the
highest expression levels of α7 nAChRs during early post-
natal development (Happe & Morley, 2004). The globular
cells in the VNLL, the most abundant cell type in the
ventral part of the VNLL, receive a calyx-like single and
powerful glutamatergic input (Berger et al. 2014; Caspari
et al. 2015) that originates from octopus cells in the
cochlear nucleus (Glendenning et al. 1981; Schofield &
Cant, 1997). Octopus cells initiate action potentials with
extreme temporal fidelity (Golding et al. 1995; Oertel &
Wickesberg, 2002). Hence, these VNLL neurons provide
a strong and well-timed inhibition to neurons in the
auditorymidbrain(SaintMarie&Baker,1990;SaintMarie
et al. 1997; Riquelme et al. 2001) and have been suggested
to be important for sound pattern analysis including
speech perception (Adams, 1997; Oertel & Wickesberg,
2002; Spencer et al. 2015). These neurons are thus
likely to contribute to the observed temporal processing
deficits in response to chronic developmental nicotine∗
exposure.
The present study explores the effect of perinatal
nicotine exposure on synaptic maturation of the calyx-like
auditory brainstem synapse in globular cells of the
VNLL. These neurons developmentally express high
levels of nAChRs (Happe & Morley, 2004), which
are likely to regulate the maturation of glutamatergic
inputs. We also addressed the question to what extent
nicotine exposure alters the input–output relationship
of these neurons. To obtain a more complete view
of
the
physiological
mechanisms
underlying
these
changes, we analysed the functional distribution of
nAChRs and characterized developmental changes in
nAChR function induced by nicotine exposure in these
neurons.
Methods
Ethical approval
All experiments were performed in accordance with
German animal welfare legislation and approved by the
Landesamt f¨
ur Gesundheit und Soziales (LAGESO, Berlin,
Germany). The authors understand the ethical principles
under which The Journal of Physiology operates and the
experiments conform to the principles and regulations
outlined in The Journal (Grundy, 2015).
Animals and chronic nicotine treatment
Experiments were performed on C57/Bl6 mice bred in
our departmental animal facility. Mice were exposed to
100 μg ml−1 nicotine (free base in 2% saccharin) via
the drinking water for 3 weeks prior to mating, during
pregnancy, and until weaning. Control groups included
mice receiving 2% saccharin in the drinking water or
plain drinking water. Drinking solutions were changed
twice a week. All animals had ad libitum access to standard
laboratory food pellets and drinking water at all times. The
nicotine dose was chosen based on other studies showing
that oral doses between 10 μg ml−1 and 200 μg ml−1
have effects on sensory processing and behaviour in
rodents (Sparks & Pauly, 1999; Pauly et al. 2004; Huang
et al. 2008; Horst et al. 2012; Zhu et al. 2012). However,
perinatal nicotine exposure to similar doses had no or
only little effect on hearing thresholds, pup survival and
body weight (Liang et al. 2006; Sun et al. 2008; Zhu
et al. 2012).
In the experiments with nicotine exposure, we used no
more than two offspring from any given litter to mini-
mize the contribution of litter effects to the data. We used
3–5 litters and 3–7 mice from each experimental group

to achieve an n value of 9–21 neurons for each type of
analysis. For the analysis of short-term depression, only
2–4 mice from 2 litters were used for each condition to
achieve an n value of 5 to 6.
Slice preparation
All agents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Germany)
and Biotrend (Germany) unless otherwisew indicated.
Slices were obtained from male and female pups
of nicotine-treated (nic), saccharin-treated (sac) and
untreated (ctr) C57/Bl6 dams. Patch-clamp recordings
were performed from neurons of pups at postnatal
day 8/9 (P8), 14/15 (P14) and 22/23 (P22). Animals
were decapitated under isoflurane inhalation anaesthesia
(5%). Brains were removed in ice-cold oxygenated
(95% O2–5% CO2) sucrose replacement solution (in
mM: 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 0.5 CaCl2,
6 MgCl2, 25 glucose and 200 sucrose, pH 7.4). Trans-
verse brainstem slices (180 μm) were cut with a vibratome
(VT1200S; Leica, Germany), incubated at 32°C for
15 min in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF)
containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4,
26 NaHCO3, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2 and 25 glucose, and
then maintained at room temperature. For recordings,
slices were transferred to a recording chamber, which was
perfused continuously with oxygenated ACSF at 32°C, and
visualized with an upright microscope (Axioscope, Zeiss,
Germany) using infrared-differential interference contrast
optics.
Electrophysiology
Current and voltage clamp recordings were made from
visually identified VNLL neurons using a Multiclamp
700A amplifier (Axon Instruments, USA). All experiments
were performed at a near-physiological temperature of
32°C. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass
capillaries (BioMedical Instruments, Germany) on a
DMZ Universal Puller (Zeitz Instruments, Germany).
When filled with electrode solution, patch pipettes had
a resistance of 2–4 M�.
For current clamp recordings the pipette solution
contained (in mM): 125 potassium gluconate, 5 KCl,
10 Hepes, 1 EGTA, 2 Na2ATP, 2 MgATP, 0.3 Na2GTP and
10 sodium phosphocreatine, pH 7.25 with KOH. To record
synapticcurrentspatchelectrodeswerefilledwith(inmM):
99 CsMeSO4, 41 CsCl, 10 Hepes, 10 EGTA, 2 Na2ATP,
2 MgATP, 0.3 Na2GTP, 5 TEA-Cl and 1 CaCl2, and
5 QX314, pH 7.25 with CsOH.
During current clamp experiments, the bridge balance
was adjusted to compensate for artifacts arising from
electrode resistance. During voltage clamp recordings,
whole-cell capacitance was compensated. The series
resistance (<10 M�) was compensated to a residual of
2–2.5 M� and was not allowed to change more than 20%
during recordings.
Neurons were selected to be ventrolateral VNLL
neurons (Caspari et al. 2015) based on the following
criteria: visual guided identification of area in the
ventral VNLL lateral of the lemniscal fibre bundle
with medium-sized, round neurons, extremely fast rise
(<0.3 ms) and decay kinetics (<0.8 ms) of excitatory
postsynaptic currents (EPSCs; voltage clamp condition),
and onset response pattern to depolarizing current
step injections (current clamp condition) and little
hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) activation
upon hyperpolarization.
Synaptic
currents
were
evoked
stimulating
the
ascending fibres with a glass electrode filled with
2 M NaCl. Stimulation electrodes were placed in the fibre
bundle about 20–50 μm ventral to the recorded neuron.
EPSCs were isolated by addition of 1 μM strychnine and
10 μM SR95531. EPSCs were evoked by brief biphasic
pulses (100 μs, stimulation intensities 5–100 V) triggered
by an analogue stimulus isolation unit (BSI-950, Dagan
Corporation, USA). Threshold for synaptic responses
was usually around 20 V. For the analysis of input
number, the stimulation intensity was gradually increased
in increments of 5 V up to 50 V and thereafter in
increments of 10 V up to 100 V. The number of input
fibres was determined by visually identifying groups
of similar EPSC amplitudes. Each group presumably
reflects the activation of an individual input fibre (Kim
& Kandler, 2003; Walcher et al. 2011). 10–90% rise time
and tau decay (fitting a double-exponential function for
P8 VNLL neurons or a single-exponential function for
P14 and P22 VNLL neurons) of synaptic currents were
assessed from responses evoked by minimal stimulation
which was defined as the stimulation strength where a
stepwise increase of 2 V resulted in the first measureable
EPSC. In about 20% of the neurons recorded under
both experimental conditions no EPSC could be evoked,
which was most likely due to cut fibres in the brain
slice. These neurons were excluded from the analysis. To
estimate short-term plastic changes of excitatory inputs to
repetitive stimulations (50, 100, 200 and 300 Hz, 15 pulses,
10 repetitions), EPSC amplitudes were normalized to the
first amplitude. Steady state depression was obtained by
calculating the mean value of the last three normalized
EPSC amplitudes.
The membrane resting potential was corrected by the
junction potential of −10.5 mV. Input resistance was
assessed from the peak hyperpolarization triggered by
−100 pA current injection according to Ohm’s law.

Puff application experiments
Membrane
potential
changes
and
inward
currents
mediated by nAChRs were evoked by locally applying
1 mM acetylcholine (ACh) under constant perfusion of
the recording chamber with ACSF. Atropine, but no
other receptor blockers, was applied throughout the
experiments to block muscarinic AChRs. ACh was applied
with short pressure pulses (200 ms, �7 psi, 10 s interval)
through a micropipette identical to the patch pipette using
a pneumatic drug ejection system (PDES-2L, npi electro-
nic GmbH, Tamm, Germany). The tip of the puff pipette
was positioned within 10–20 μm of the somata of the
neurons. Mecamylamine (MEC) and methyllycaconitine
(MLA) were used as specific nAChR antagonists. Stock
solutions of all drugs were prepared in distilled water.
Stock solutions were diluted to their final concentration
in ACSF on the day of the experiment. The antagonists
were applied by bath perfusion. The ACh-induced
depolarization of the membrane was calculated as the peak
of voltage deflection from the average of three consecutive
traces. ACh-induced currents were determined as the
peak of the current deflection from the average of
five consecutive traces. To distinguish between the
fast-activating, MLA-sensitive and the slow-activating
MEC-sensitive peak current we set a time window. The
initial MLA-sensitive current amplitude was calculated at
the peak between 0 and 0.2 s. The residual MEC-sensitive
current amplitude was determined at the peak of the
remaining current after application of the MLA. The
ACh-induced charge was calculated as the area under
the curve.
Data acquisition and statistical analysis
Stimulus generation and recordings were done with
pCLAMP
(Version
10.2,
Axon
Instruments).
Both
voltage and current signals were low-pass filtered at
10 kHz with a four-pole Bessel filter and sampled
at a rate of 20 kHz. Traces were digitally filtered at
2 kHz. All electrophysiological data were analysed in
IGOR Pro (Version 6.22, Wavemetrics, USA) using the
custom-written package Neuromatic (Jason Rothman,
UCL, London, UK) or in Clampfit (Version 10.0, Axon
Instruments).
Results are expressed as means ± standard error of the
mean(SEM).Statisticalsignificancewasdeterminedbythe
ANOVA test statistic followed by the appropriate post hoc
test or by applying Student’s paired or unpaired two-tailed
t test with significance thresholds of P < 0.05 (∗), P < 0.01
(∗∗) and P < 0.001 (∗∗∗). For non-parametric distributions
the Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test followed
by Games Howell or Dunn’s multiple comparison were
used.
Results
Perinatal nicotine exposure drastically reduces
excitatory synaptic transmission in VNLL neurons
Weinvestigatedtheeffectofperinatalnicotineexposureon
synaptic maturation in the VNLL, a nucleus that expresses
a large number of nAChRs during development and
plays a prominent role in the processing of the temporal
acoustic pattern (Oertel, 1999; Spencer et al. 2015). Using
whole-cell electrophysiology in acute auditory brain-
stem slices we analysed excitatory postsynaptic currents
(EPSCs) in neurons of the ventrolateral VNLL from
untreated (ctr) and nicotine-treated (nic) animals at post-
natal day 22 (P22). We focused on globular neurons
in the ventrolateral VNLL, since this group of neurons
display distinct physiological properties (Caspari et al.
2015), and respond with high temporal precision to the
temporal pattern of sounds (Recio-Spinoso & Joris, 2014).
To estimate the number of fibre inputs (step number)
and the strength of the excitatory inputs we systematically
increased the stimulation intensity (see Methods). As
previously reported (Caspari et al. 2015) almost all
VNLL neurons exhibited all-or-none EPSC responses with
extremely large amplitudes irrespective of stimulation
strength in both control and nicotine-treated animals
(Fig. 1A and B). This implies that under both experimental
conditions in most cases only one excitatory fibre input
is contacting each postsynaptic neuron (ctr 1.20 ± 0.11,
n = 15, nic 1.32 ± 0.11, n = 19, Mann-Whitney
U test, P = 0.567, Fig. 1C). However, in nicotine-treated
animals the EPSC amplitude from one input fibre (min.
EPSC) was almost 50% smaller than in control mice
(min. EPSC amplitude: ctr 8.9 ± 1.2 nA, n = 17;
nic 4.6 ± 0.9 nA, n = 19, Mann-Whitney U test, P = 0.012,
Fig. 1C). Similarly, the maximal EPSC amplitude, the
excitatorycurrentevokedbyallinputs,wasgreatlyreduced
in nicotine-treated animals (max. EPSC amplitude: ctr
10.0 ± 1.2 nA, n = 15; nic 6.2 ± 1.0 nA, n = 19,
Student’s unpaired t test, P = 0.023, Fig. 1C). In contrast,
EPSC kinetics was only minimally affected by the nicotine
treatment (tau decay: ctr 0.30 ± 0.01 ms, n = 17,
nic 0.38 ± 0.05 ms, n = 19, Mann-Whitney U test, P =
0.384,Fig.1D,right;10–90%risetime:ctr0.18±0.004ms,
n = 17, nic 0.21 ± 0.01 ms, n = 18; Mann-Whitney
U test, P = 0.025, Fig. 1D, left). Saccharine-only treatment
had only minor effects on the synaptic input properties
of VNLL neurons during the entire developmental
period investigated (Fig. 2). We therefore compared the
nicotine-treated VNLL neurons only with the control
VNLL neurons.
To elucidate whether this nicotine-induced prominent
reduction in EPSC amplitude was due to a postsynaptic
or a presynaptic effect we further studied short-term
plasticity of this large synapse with various stimulation

All
excitatory inputs to VNLL neurons showed pronounced
synaptic short-term depression varying with stimulation
frequency (Fig. 3A and B). Nicotine exposure had no
effect on the steady state depression for all stimulation
frequencies tested (Fig. 3C). To estimate the effect of
nicotine treatment on the quantal size at this synapse we
analysed spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) in both control
and nicotine-treated mice. Again, nicotine treatment
caused a significant reduction in sEPSC amplitude
(ctr −60.5 ± 3.8 pA, n = 19, nic −49.7 ± 3.2 pA,
n = 19; Mann-Whitney U test, P = 0.034, Fig. 3E).
Nevertheless, the nicotine effect on sEPSC amplitude
was much smaller compared to the nicotine-induced
reduction of evoked EPSCs. Again, sEPSC tau decay
of both control and nicotine-treated VNLL neurons
remained similar (ctr 0.22 ± 0.01 ms, n = 19,
nic 0.23 ± 0.01 ms, n = 19, Mann-Whitney U test,
P = 0.872, Fig. 3F). Also, sEPSC frequency did not differ
significantly between treatments (ctr 3.9 ± 0.8 Hz, n = 13,
nic 2.7 ± 0.5 Hz, n = 13, Mann-Whitney U test, P = 0.700,
Fig. 3G).
Taken together, our data demonstrate that perinatal
nicotine exposure leads to a profound reduction of evoked
EPSC amplitudes and a smaller reduction of spontaneous
EPSC amplitudes, whereas short-term plasticity and
sEPSC frequency remained unchanged. This indicates
that perinatal nicotine treatment impairs synaptic trans-
mission via a postsynaptic effect rather than a presynaptic
effect.

Developmental remodelling of excitatory synaptic
transmission is impaired in nicotine-treated mice
To determine at what developmental stage nicotine
exposure had its strongest effect we additionally recorded
evoked EPSCs in control and nicotine-treated pups just
before (P8) and several days after hearing onset (P14).
Just before hearing onset VNLL neurons of control
animals received around three inputs. Within a few
days after hearing onset (at P14) the number of inputs
impinging on one VNLL neuron was reduced to one
input in most cases (Fig. 4A and D; Table 1). This
developmental refinement was similar but slightly delayed
in nicotine-treated mice, where the pruning was only
completed by P22 (Fig. 4D). At P8 the single fibre EPSC
amplitude (min. EPSC) did not statistically differ between
control and nicotine-treated VNLL neurons. Yet, at P22
this amplitude had increased more than twofold in control

natal nicotine exposure did not affect the pronounced
developmental acceleration of evoked EPSCs, which also
occurred during the first weeks after hearing onset (Fig. 4E
and F; Table 1).
Our data show that at P8, just before hearing onset,
properties of excitatory inputs to VNLL neurons were
rather similar in nicotine-treated and control mice.
However, the developmental refinement and the increase
in total excitatory synaptic strength around and after
hearing onset are affected by the nicotine treatment. This
indicates that perinatal nicotine exposure disturbs the
maturation of this excitatory synapse only around and
after, but not before hearing onset.
Chronic nicotine exposure does not affect intrinsic
membrane properties
Activation of nAChRs may also lead to changes in the
ion channel composition of neurons. To test whether
prenatal nicotine exposure affects the intrinsic membrane
properties of neurons we applied depolarizing and hyper-
polarizing current injections and recorded the voltage
responses of VNLL neurons of control, saccharin- and
nicotine-treated animals just before (P8), a few days (P14)
and several days after hearing onset (P22). Depolarization
of the neurons resulted predominantly in an onset-type
firing pattern with one or only a few spikes at the
onset of supra-threshold depolarizing current injections.
Hyperpolarization of the neurons resulted in a minor
depolarizingvoltagesagindicativeofonlylittleIh (Fig.5A).
These results are in accordance with those of Caspari et al.
(2015) showing a similar response pattern in adult-like
mice. Perinatal nicotine exposure did not change the firing
pattern of the VNLL neurons at all developmental stages
tested. Moreover, neither resting membrane potential,
input resistance nor membrane time constants were
affected by the nicotine treatment. Also, action potential
half-width, amplitude and latency were not changed
(Fig. 5B–G, Table 2). This shows that chronic activation
of nAChRs in these neurons has no effect on the intrinsic
membrane properties in VNLL neurons.
Nicotine treatment decreases spiking fidelity and
increases action potential jitter in VNLL neurons
Next, we were interested in discovering to what extent this
considerable reduction in EPSC amplitude affects spiking

as minimal stimulation plus 15 V to reliably evoke
action potentials in the presynaptic fibre. Experiments
were conducted in the presence of 10 μM SR95531
and 1 μM strychnine to block inhibition. At P21–24
spikes are reliably produced at 50 Hz stimulation in
both, control and nicotine treated animals. For higher
frequencies (>100 Hz) the probability of spiking dropped
considerably throughout the train in both control and
nicotine-treated VNLL neurons (Fig. 6A). For frequencies
of 200 Hz and 333 Hz the decrease in spike rate was more
pronounced in VNLL neurons of nicotine-treated animals
compared to control animals (200 Hz: ctr 95.6 ± 2.7%,
n = 9, nic 70.7 ± 11.0%, n = 9, Mann-Whitney
U test, P = 0.043; 333 Hz: ctr 72.8 ± 8.0%, n = 9, nic
42.1 ± 11.3%, n = 9, Student’s unpaired t test, P = 0.042;
Fig. 6B). To further examine the temporal precision of
the APs, we analysed the distribution of the timing of
the spikes (jitter) for the 100 Hz stimulation train as the
number of failures was almost zero in both experimental
groups under this condition. The timing of the APs was
very similar for the first stimuli of the train but the jitter of
the spiking response to later stimuli in the train was greatly
enhanced in nicotine-treated VNLL neurons compared to
control neurons (Fig. 6C and D). Interestingly, the jitter of
EPSC peaks for 100 and 200 Hz train stimulation did not
change after nicotine treatment (data not shown). Hence,
there was a loss in temporal precision only of the spike
signal after chronic nicotine treatment. This indicates
a detrimental effect of perinatal nicotine exposure on
spike timing and precision in auditory brainstem neurons
renowned for their extremely low jittered spike response.
Both α7-type and non-α7-type nicotinic AChRs are
present in VNLL neurons before hearing onset
Next, we were interested to discover whether ventro-
lateral VNLL neurons possess functional nicotinic acetyl-
choline receptors (nAChRs) during this period of synaptic
remodelling. We therefore examined the effects of local
application of acetylcholine (ACh) on VNLL neurons
in slices obtained from mice before hearing onset at
P8 while blocking muscarinic AChRs with atropine.
The application of ACh (1 mM) with short pressure
pulses (200 ms) to the somata of ventrolateral VNLL
neurons resulted in a transient depolarization of the
membrane potential ranging between 5 and 11 mV.
The change in membrane potential consisted of a very
fast rising depolarization followed by a slowly decaying
repolarization lasting more than 1 s (Fig. 7A). The mean
voltage deflection elicited by puff application of ACh was
7.34 ± 0.84 mV (n = 7) (Fig. 7B).
The majority of nAChRs in the brain are either α7
homomers or α4β2 heteromers, which differ in their
kinetics and their calcium permeability and play different
functionalroles(Gottietal.2009).Tocharacterizethesub-
unit composition of the nAChRs whole-cell patch clamp
recordings were performed in voltage clamp mode in the
presence of atropine to block mAChRs. Puff-applying ACh
onto the somata of ventrolateral VNLL neurons resulted
in a small and transient inward current. Application of the
α7-type nAChR antagonist MLA, which binds to neuronal
α-bungarotoxin sites and is highly selective for the α7-type
nAChR (Alkondon et al. 1992), blocked the initial rapidly
activating component of the inward current as indicated
by a red arrow in Fig. 6C (ctr −128.7 ± 30.2 pA, MLA:
−19.7 ± 2.0 pA, n = 9, Student’s paired t test, P = 0.007,
Fig. 7C and D). Nevertheless, a considerable current
component was still left, indicating that the ACh-induced
current was also mediated via MLA-insensitive nAChR
subtypes. This residual current displayed a much slower
time course. We therefore applied the general nAChR
antagonist MEC (25 μM), a non-specific blocker for all
nAChR subtypes, which completely blocked the residual
current in all cases (ctr −72.5 ± 22.0 pA, MEC:
−13.3 ± 1.0 pA, n = 7, Student’s paired t test, P = 0.040,
Fig. 7C and D). MLA almost completely eliminated the
initial current but only abolished 49% of the charge
flowing through the membrane (ctr −99.5 ± 36.5 pC,
+MLA:−50.8±15.0pC,+MLA/MEC:−0.075±0.94pC,
ANOVA, F(2,22) = 3.84, P = 0.037, Fig. 7E). As MLA

blocked the entire initial current, the rise time of the
pre-drug trace will give a good estimate for the rise
time of the fast MLA-sensitive current component. The
rise time of the MLA-sensitive fast current component
differed significantly from the rise time of the slow residual
current component (ctr 15.9 ± 4.0 ms, n = 8, residual:
189.3 ± 48.8 ms, n = 9, Student’s unpaired t test,
P = 0.007, Fig. 7F). Taken together, our pharmacological
study suggests that ventrolateral VNLL neurons possess
functional α7- and non-α7-type nAChRs during this
period of synaptic remodelling. Note, however, that an
increase in presynaptic activity levels was never detected
during our experiments, which suggests that functional
nAChRs are missing on the presynaptic site at this
synapse.
Developmental decline of nicotinergic currents
is delayed in nicotine-treated mice
The expression of nAChRs especially of the α7-subtype is
developmentally regulated and drops profoundly during
the first 3 postnatal weeks in auditory brainstem neurons
(Happe & Morley, 2004). On the other hand, there
is evidence that chronic nicotine exposure upregulates

nAChRs (Molinari et al. 1998; Buisson & Bertrand,
2001; Kawai & Berg, 2001). We therefore determined the
developmental profile of functional nAChRs in VNLL
neurons of control and nicotine-treated animals. At P8
puff application of ACh induced a small but pronounced
inward current in both control and nicotine-treated
animals(ctr−74.8±15.2pA,n=24,nic−64.5±14.5pA,
n = 16, Kruskal-Wallis test, P > 0.99, Fig. 8A and B).
For both experimental conditions this current consisted
of two current components, a rapidly activating current
component and a slowly activating current component.
At P14 this current was greatly diminished in control
animals, whereas in nicotine-treated animals the ACh
induced current persisted (ctr −19.8 ± 3.9 pA, n = 24, nic
−76.3 ± 16.4 pA, n = 18, Kruskal-Wallis test, P = 0.0014,
Fig. 8A and B). However, at P22 the Ach-evoked current
had almost disappeared for both experimental groups
(ctr −21.7 ± 8.9 pA, n = 18, nic −22.4 ± 5.4 pA,
n = 19; Kruskal-Wallis test, P > 0.99, Fig. 8A and B).
Not only the current amplitude but also the proportion
of neurons with responses to ACh decreased with age.
Almost �80% of the neurons responded to ACh at P8,
whereas at P14 only �30% of the neurons in control
animals, but still more than �80% of the neurons in
nicotine-treated animals displayed ACh-induced currents.
At P22 ACh-evoked inward currents could be elicited
in �17% of the control VNLL neurons while �47% of
nicotine-treated VNLL neurons still responded to ACh
with a small inward current (Fig. 8B and C).
This parallel decline in functional nAChRs and
synaptic remodelling indicates that the reduction in EPSC
amplitude might be a direct effect of chronic activation
of nAChRs on VNLL neurons and not an indirect affect
by altering neural activity levels at the preceding neural
circuits.
Discussion
Developmental

exposure
causes
deterioration of temporal auditory processing in humans
and in animal models (McCartney et al. 1994; Sun et al.
2008; Kable et al. 2009; Peck et al. 2010). We therefore
investigated the effect of perinatal nicotine exposure on
synaptic transmission and integration in the VNLL, an
auditorybrainsteminvolvedintheanalysisofthetemporal
pattern of sounds. We show that excitatory synaptic
strength in VNLL neurons is profoundly reduced by peri-
natal nicotine exposure. As a consequence, both efficacy
and the timing of action potential initiation deteriorate,
suggesting maladapted transmission of information
during sound processing. In contrast, nicotine exposure
had little or no effect on synaptic pruning and the
maturation of intrinsic neuronal properties. We also
show that these neurons express functional postsynaptic
α7-type and non-α7-type nAChRs only during this critical
period. Nicotine exposure delays this developmental
decline of nAChR expression, arguing in favour of a direct
effect of nAChR activation. These results provide evidence
for a prominent developmental effect of nAChR activation
on synaptic maturation in the VNLL.
nAChR activation may directly modulate synaptic
transmission and maturation in the VNLL
An important question arising during our study was
whether nicotine acts directly on the synapse under
investigation or whether neural circuits upstream of VNLL
neurons are altered and mediate an activity-dependent
effect on the development of VNLL synapses. We showed
that nAChRs of the α7 subtype are functional in post-
synaptic VNLL neurons during early development and

This is in agreement with anatomical studies, which show
that the prominent labelling of the α subunit of the nAChR
aroundhearingonsetgreatlydiminishesthereafter(Happe
& Morley, 2004). These receptors are highly permeable
for calcium and activation of these receptors results in
plastic changes of neural circuits and ultimately leads to
the remodelling and refinement of input maps (Aramakis
et al. 2000; Liu et al. 2007; Abreu-Villac
¸a et al. 2011). It
is thus likely that excessive perinatal nicotine signalling
modifies synaptic development directly in the VNLL.
But how do postsynaptic nAChRs directly interact
with the development of the excitatory inputs? In our
study the amplitude of excitatory synaptic transmission
was greatly reduced by developmental nicotine exposure,
while the kinetics of the synaptic currents remained
unchanged. Excitatory synaptic transmission in VNLL
granule cells of mature animals is mediated via a single
calyx-like synapse, which results in an all-or-nothing
response to stimulation of the incoming ascending fibres
(Berger et al. 2014; Caspari et al. 2015). Thus a reduction
in input strength might be a reflection of fewer pre-
synaptic release sites, a change in release probability or a
decrease in postsynaptic receptor density. Since neither the
frequency of sEPSCs nor short-term synaptic depression
was altered, but sEPSC amplitude was reduced after
nicotine exposure, a decrease in AMPA receptor density
at the postsynaptic membrane might at least partially
explain this reduction in synaptic strength. Indeed, direct
and acute activation of nAChRs increases the diffusion
of GluR1 subunits of AMPA receptors to the postsynaptic
site and strengthens AMPA receptor-mediated currents by
changing the phosphorylation state of the receptor (Halff
et al. 2014; Tang et al. 2015). Both of these processes
are dependent on Ca2+ influx and involve interaction
with several other postsynaptic proteins. In contrast,
chronic developmental activation of nAChRs may have
more diverse effects on synaptic transmission. Previous
studies show that developmental nicotine exposure may
either increase or decrease the strength of synaptic trans-
mission depending on brain area, age and receptor sub-
type investigated (Huang et al. 2008; Pilarski et al.

2011; Wang et al. 2011; Jaiswal et al. 2015). One
possible explanation for these diverse effects is the strong
and rapid desensitization of the α7-containing nAChRs
(Albuquerqueetal.2009),leadingtodiminishedsignalling
through this receptor when nicotine is applied chronically.
It is most likely that α7-containing nAChRs in VNLL
neurons are permanently desensitized during nicotine
application and, as a consequence, these receptors are
upregulated.
To our surprise the pruning of excitatory inputs to
VNLL neurons was not diminished in nicotine-treated
mice. A direct link between nAChRs and synaptic
remodelling has been suggested for a number of cortical
neural circuits (Liu et al. 2007; Lozada et al. 2012;
Ramanathan et al. 2015). However, these experiments
mostly relied on the deletion of specific nAChR sub-
types or on disruption of cholinergic inputs to the target
cells which in both cases reduces cholinergic signalling. As
pointed out above, we do not know whether cholinergic
signalling is enhanced or diminished or just altered in
timing during chronic nicotine administration. Thus we
cannot rule out a possible contribution of cholinergic
signalling to synaptic refinement in the VNLL at the
moment.
Possible indirect effect of nicotine on VNLL neurons
via activity-dependent mechanisms
Since the VNLL synapse undergoes massive changes
just after hearing onset, when activity levels surge, an
activity-dependent component in the maturation of this
synapse cannot be ruled out. It is therefore possible
that besides these direct effects of nAChRs activation
on VNLL synapse maturation, indirect, nicotine-induced
changes in activity levels and timing upstream of this
synapse might also play a role. For example, inner and
outer hair cells receive prominent descending cholinergic
inputs as early as embryonic day 16 (Simmons & Morley,
2011). Activation of the corresponding receptors, which
mostlycomprisetheα9andα10subunits,regulatesynapse
stabilization and maturation of the cochlea (Vetter et al.
1999; Murthy et al. 2009; Turcan et al. 2010). It is also
known that a deletion of the α9 subunit in the cochlea
modifies the temporal pattern of spontaneous activity in
the auditory nerve fibre and impairs synaptic refinement
in an auditory brainstem projection before hearing onset
(Clause et al. 2014). Nonetheless, to what extent perinatal
nicotine exposure affects physiology and activity levels in
the cochlea is unknown at the moment.

Nicotine exposure disturbs maturation of synaptic inputs
3587
In the ascending auditory pathway, octopus cells of
the cochlear nucleus, which provide the large calyx-like
input to the VNLL granule cells, are under cholinergic
regulation during early postnatal development. Right
around hearing onset, between P3 and P12, these neurons
receiveabundantcholinergicinputs,acetylcholineesterase
levels are elevated and α7-containing nAChRs are found
in this region during the same time period (Morley et al.
2004). This indicates that nicotine might regulate activity
levelsinoctopuscellswhichcouldleadtoaberrantsynaptic
development at its output, the excitatory synapses in the
VNLL (Happe & Morley, 2004).
Functional consequences of nicotine-mediated
impaired synaptic transmission in the VNLL
Our experiments show that the nicotine-mediated
reduction in synaptic strength also leads to spike failures
and increased jitter in VNLL neurons. For two reasons
these observed changes might be even larger in the in vivo
situation compared to our recordings in acute brain slices.
First, spontaneous spiking activity, which is generally
missing in the acute brain slices preparation of the
auditory brainstem, leads to a chronically depressed state
of synapses in different parts of the auditory brainstem
with generally much reduced synaptic currents (Hermann
et al. 2007; Lorteije et al. 2009; Kuenzel et al. 2011).
Since our experiments show that state spike failure and
jitter was greatly augmented in nicotine-treated animals,
especially later during train stimulation when synaptic
depression had reached steady state levels, spike failure
and jitter might be more pronounced in vivo. Second,
we pharmacologically blocked inhibitory inputs, which
are prominent in these neurons (Caspari et al. 2015), since
we could not reliably evoke coincident excitatory and
inhibitory input activity. We also do not know whether
sound stimulation evoked coincident excitatory and
inhibitory input activity in these neurons. Nevertheless,
coincident inhibitory and excitatory input activity might
increase spike failures, especially later in the stimulus train
as previously shown in cochlear nucleus neurons (Chanda
& Xu-Friedman, 2010).
But what would an increase in spike failure and
deterioration of spike timing in VNLL neurons mean for
the perception of acoustic signals? The granule neurons in
the VNLL provide a powerful and short latency inhibitory
input to neurons in the VNLL and the inferior colliculus
(Nayagam et al. 2005, 2006; Spencer et al. 2015). This
inhibition arrives a few milliseconds before the excitation
in these neurons. Since octopus cells, the input to the
VNLL neurons, and VNLL neurons themselves, respond
besttobroadbandsoundstimuli(Rhode etal.1983;Rhode
& Smith, 1986), a depression of spectral splatter that
occurs at the start of a sharp onset sound was proposed
as a function of this circuit during sound processing
(Spencer et al. 2015). Other proposed functions of pre-
cedinginhibitionaretheshapingofselectivityoffrequency
modulations and the determination of first spike latency
(Gittelman & Pollak, 2011; Pollak et al. 2011). In all
cases, a maladapted preceding inhibition as observed after
developmental nicotine exposure may degrade temporal
processing of sounds including speech. This proposed
mechanism of perinatal nicotine exposure on neuro-
nal activity in the inferior colliculus is supported by
measurements of auditory brainstem responses in infants
of heavy-smoking and non-smoking mothers. In two
independent studies, wave V latency, corresponding to
inferior colliculus activity, was significantly shorter in
infants of smoking mothers compared to non-smoking
mothers (Kable et al. 2009; Peck et al. 2010). Weaker onset
inhibition in the inferior colliculus induced by unreliable
spiking of VNLL neurons could be an underlying cause of
this observation.
Since nAChRs are broadly expressed in the ascending
auditory pathway, perinatal nicotine exposure may not
exclusively affect the maturation of VNLL synapses but
could lead to alterations in neural circuits throughout
the ascending auditory system. Cortical circuits, including
the auditory cortex, are especially affected by changes in
nicotinic activity levels (Aramakis et al. 2000; Liang et al.
2006). Nonetheless, our study provides the first evidence
for a profound effect of perinatal nicotine exposure on
the development of neural circuits in the auditory brain-
stem possibly involved in the temporal sound analysis
important for speech processing.
