IMPORTANCE Depression is a common cause of morbidity and disability worldwide. Parental
depression is associated with early-life child neurodevelopmental, behavioral, emotional,
mental, and social problems. More studies are needed to explore the link between parental
depression and long-term child outcomes.
OBJECTIVE To examine the associations of parental depression with child school performance
at the end of compulsory education (approximately age 16 years).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Parental depression diagnoses (based on the
International Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision [ICD-8], International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9], and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases,
10th Revision [ICD-10]) in inpatient records from 1969 onward, outpatient records beginning
in 2001, and school grades at the end of compulsory education were collected for all children
born from 1984 to 1994 in Sweden. The final analytic sample size was 1 124 162 biological
children. We examined the associations of parental depression during different periods
(before birth, after birth, and during child ages 1-5, 6-10, and 11-16 years, as well as any time
before the child’
s final year of compulsory schooling) with the final school grades. Linear
regression models adjusted for various child and parent characteristics. The dates of the
analysis were January to November 2015.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE Decile of school grades at the end of compulsory education
(range, 1-10, with 1 being the lowest and 10 being the highest).
RESULTS The study cohort comprised 1 124 162 children, of whom 48.9% were female.
Maternal depression and paternal depression at any time before the final compulsory school
year were associated with worse school performance. After covariate adjustment, these
associations decreased to −0.45 (95% CI, −0.48 to −0.42) and −0.40 (−0.43 to −0.37) lower
deciles, respectively. These effect sizes are similarly as large as the observed difference in
school performance between the lowest and highest quintiles of family income but
approximately one-third of the observed difference between maternal education of 9 or less
vs more than 12 years. Both maternal depression and paternal depression at different periods
(before birth, after birth, and during child ages 1-5, 6-10, and 11-16 years) generally were
associated with worse school performance. Child sex modified the associations of maternal
depression with school performance such that maternal depression had a larger negative
influence on child school performance for girls compared with boys.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Diagnoses of parental depression throughout a child’
s life
were associated with worse school performance at age 16 years. Our results suggest that
diagnoses of parental depression may have a far-reaching effect on an important aspect of
child development, with implications for future life course outcomes.

D
epression is a leading cause of morbidity and disabil-
ityworldwide,1withadverseconsequencesnotjustfor
affected persons but also for family members, espe-
cially children. The results of studies2-7 have suggested the as-
sociations of parental depression with child neurodevelop-
mental, behavioral, emotional, and psychiatric problems.
While parental depression has been linked with child out-
comes, the findings of only a few studies have suggested an as-
sociation between parental depression and poorer school
performance.8-13 For example, the results of a cross-sectional
study8 of 248 children aged 4 to 6 years suggested that chil-
dren with depressed fathers were 9 times more likely to have
language development problems than those children without
depressedfathers.Astudy11of132womeninsouthLondon,En-
gland, found that children of mothers with postnatal depres-
sion had lower IQ scores at age 11 years, as well as lower math-
ematical reasoning and greater special educational needs.
However, questions remain as to whether parental depression
hasanimportanteffectonschoolperformanceorwhethersuch
associations are due to confounding because few investiga-
tions have the sample size and available covariates to robustly
examine this issue. Notably, Evans et al12 examined more than
5000 mother-child pairs in a United Kingdom birth cohort and
foundnoassociationofmaternalpostnataldepressionwithchild
IQ at age 8 years. They also observed that an apparent effect of
prenatal depression on child IQ (approximately a 3-point re-
duction) disappeared after covariate adjustment for maternal
health and sociodemographic characteristics.
Poor school performance is a powerful predictor of future
healthoutcomes,includingpoorerself-ratedhealth,underweight
oroverweightstatus,bingedrinking,psychiatricmorbidity,and
even suicide.14-18 Moreover, by its influence on educational at-
tainment and subsequent occupation and income, school per-
formance affects adult social position, one of the strongest
predictors of future health and mortality.19,20 The mechanisms

Methods
Study Population
This investigation was a nationwide cohort study of children
born in Sweden from 1984 to 1994 (n = 1 196 929). Exclusion
criteria were adopted children, children who could not be
linked to their biological mother or father, and children with-
out data on school grades at the end of compulsory educa-
tion (because of death, emigration, lack of completion, intel-
lectual disability, or administrative error). In the analysis,
children missing data on key covariates were excluded. The fi-
nal analytic sample consisted of 1 124 162 individuals (93.9%
of the persons born in Sweden during this period) (eFigure in
the Supplement). Characteristics of excluded individuals are
listed in eTable 1 in the Supplement. In this national sample,
depression diagnoses are based on data from national regis-
ters primarily covering inpatient admissions.
We conducted a subsample analysis in children who had
ever resided in Stockholm County, Sweden, during the study
period.39 The subsample analysis examined whether a broader
definition of parental depression influenced the results. In this
subsample, ascertainment of depression is based on both the
national register data and regional register data from outpa-
tient, specialist, and treatment centers in Stockholm County.40
This Stockholm County subsample consisted of 214 668 indi-
viduals (19.1% of the national sample). This study was ap-
proved by the institutional review board at Drexel University
(Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) and by the research ethics com-
mittee at Karolinska Institutet (Stockholm, Sweden). Follow-
ingSwedishregulation,theuseofregisterdataforresearchpur-
poses does not require informed consent. The dates of the
analysis were January to November 2015.
School Performance
Data on school grades were collected from the national school
register.41,42 Compulsory education in Sweden lasts until age
16 years on average. On completion of compulsory schooling,
studentsareassignedafinalschoolgradecalculatedasthesum
of the 16 best subject grades in the final year. For every sub-
ject, students are assigned a grade ranging from 0 to 20, in
which 0 is failing, 10 is E, 12.5 is D, 15 is C, 17.5 is B, and 20 is
A. Therefore, the final school grade can range from 0 to 320.
Because the distribution of the final grade was skewed, as well
as to increase interpretability, decile of performance (range,
1-10, with 1 being the lowest and 10 being the highest) was used
as the outcome of interest.
Parental History of Depression
For the national sample, depression diagnoses were col-
lected from the national patient register, which recorded in-
patient contacts (since 1969) and outpatient contacts (since
2001), with follow-up through 2011. We identified parental de-
pression as any registered diagnosis of a depressive episode
ormooddisorder.UsingtheNordicversions,InternationalClas-
sification of Diseases, Eighth Revision (ICD-8) code 300.4 was
used for depression diagnoses between 1969 and 1986; Inter-
national Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes

300.4, 296.2, 296.3, and 311 were used from 1987 to 1996; and
International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revi-
sion (ICD-10) codes F32 through F39 were used since 1997. The
national patient register has moderately high validity for vari-
ous psychiatric conditions, including bipolar disorder and
schizophrenia.43,44 A validation study45 of more than 3000 in-
dividualscomparedregisterdiagnosesofdepressionwithacri-
terion standard of clinical diagnoses from court-ordered in-
patient evaluations and found 88% agreement.
For the Stockholm County subsample, we identified pa-
rental depression as any diagnoses in the national patient reg-
ister or in the Stockholm County adult psychiatric outpatient
register, which records any contact with specialist outpatient
psychiatric services in Stockholm County since 1997. We used
DSM-IVcodes317to319until2008andICD-10until2009,con-
sistent with prior studies.39,46
To ensure proper temporal ordering, only parental depres-
sion diagnoses occurring before the start of the child’
s final
compulsory year were considered. Initially, we examined
whether any history of parental depression before the start of
the child’
s final year was associated with school perfor-
mance. We then examined whether depression diagnoses dur-
ing specific periods were associated with school perfor-
mance, including any history of depression before the birth of
the child, after birth (child ages 0 to <1 year), and during child
ages 1 to 5 years, 6 to 10 years, and 11 to 16 years.
Other Characteristics
Covariates of interest, identified in the literature or in prelimi-
nary analyses as associated with school performance,37,41,47
were collected from the registers. Child characteristics in-
clude sex, birth year, birth order, and whether the child was
part of a multiple birth. Pregnancy characteristics include ma-
ternalage(<20,20-24,25-29,30-34,35-39,40-44,or≥45years)
and paternal age (<20, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-
49, or ≥50 years) at the birth of the child, and maternal smok-
ing during pregnancy (yes, no, or missing) was assessed via
midwife interview at the first prenatal visit.48 Family charac-
teristics include parental education (≤9, 10-12, or ≥13 years),
quintileofdisposablefamilyincomeadjustedforyearandfam-
ily size, parental region of birth (Sweden, other Nordic coun-
tries,oroutsideofNordiccountries),andparentalalcoholabuse
before the birth of the child (ICD-8 codes 291 and 303; ICD-9
codes 291, 303, and 305.0; and ICD-10 code F10).
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were conducted using statistical software (R, ver-
sion 3.1.3; R Foundation). In descriptive analyses, we calcu-
lated the mean decile of school grades among different sub-
groups, with 95% CIs calculated using bootstrap resampling.
Generalized linear mixed models were used to assess the as-
sociations of parental depression and school performance. A
random intercept was specified for the mother, and all other
variables were considered as fixed effects. In addition to ma-
ternal and paternal depression, model 1 included child char-
acteristics (sex, multiple births, and birth year). Model 2 in-
cluded model 1 covariates and pregnancy characteristics
(maternal age at birth, birth order, and maternal smoking dur-
ing pregnancy). Model 3 included model 2 covariates and fam-
ily characteristics (paternal age, parental education, parental
alcohol abuse before the birth of the child, family income, and
parental region of birth).

Results
Table 1 lists school grades in relation to study sample charac-
teristics. Girls had better grades than boys, while younger ma-
ternal and paternal age was associated with poorer school per-
formance. Maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated
with worse school performance. Higher family income, pa-
rental education, and parental origin from Sweden were as-
sociated with better school performance.

Parental Depression and School Performance
Both crude and adjusted models indicated that parental de-
pression was associated with worse academic performance
(Table 2), although the associations decreased after covariate
adjustment.Inunadjustedanalysisofthenationalsample,ma-
ternal history and paternal history of depression at any time
before the final year of compulsory schooling were associ-
ated with −0.80 (95% CI, −0.83 to −0.77) and −0.73 (95% CI,
−0.77 to −0.69) lower deciles of school grades, respectively.
After covariate adjustment (model 3), the associations of ma-
ternal depression and paternal depression with school perfor-
mance decreased to −0.45 (95% CI, −0.48 to −0.42) and −0.40
(95% CI, −0.43 to −0.37) lower deciles, respectively.
Analysis of the Stockholm County subsample, with most
depression cases identified from outpatient care, showed ad-
verse associations with school performance on the same or-
der of magnitude. While estimates of maternal depression as-
sociations in the subsample were virtually identical to those
of the national sample, the paternal depression estimate was
approximately 33% smaller (Table 2). The Stockholm County
subsample differs from the national sample in many re-
spects, with older and better educated parents, more first-
born children, more parents born outside of Sweden, and more
families in the highest quintile of income (eTable 2 in the

Supplement). To maintain generalizability, we focus the rest
of the analyses on the national sample.
The coefficients of parental depression and key covari-
ates are compared in the Figure. For example, the magnitude
of the association between maternal depression and child
schoolperformance(−0.45deciles)waslargerthanthatforlow
family income with child school performance (−0.36 deciles
for quintile 1 vs quintile 5) but was smaller than that for low
maternal education (−1.62 deciles for ≤9 vs ≥13 years).
Timing of Maternal and Paternal Depression
We investigated whether timing of parental depression diag-
nosis influenced child school performance. There was mod-
erate recurrence of depression in the sample. Of depression
cases identified during a particular period, 13.1% to 21.5% of
parents with depression had previous diagnoses in earlier pe-
riods. For example, 6944 of the 32 824 parents (21.2%) diag-
nosed during child ages 11 to 16 years had a depression diag-
nosis in an earlier period.
In general, paternal depression and maternal depression
in all periods were independently associated with worse
school performance (Table 3, models 3a-e), although pater-
nal depression during the postnatal period did not attain
statistical significance at P < .05. Even after adjustment for
parental depression in earlier periods, the associations in
later periods remained, suggesting that parental depression
in each period was independently associated with worse
school performance.

Maternal vs Paternal Depression
In the national sample, maternal and paternal depression had
similarly large associations with school performance overall
(Table 2) and in most periods assessed (Table 3). In the Stock-
holm County subsample with a broader definition of depres-
sion, maternal depression had a larger effect than paternal de-
pression overall (Table 2) and in many periods of interest
(eTable 3 in the Supplement). For example, during the period
of child ages 11 to 16 years, the association of maternal depres-
sionwithschoolperformancewas1.6timeslarger(−0.41decile)
than that for paternal depression (−0.26 decile).
Boys vs Girls
There was evidence that the associations of maternal depres-
sion with child school performance were different for boys and
girls, but the associations of paternal depression were similar
for boys and girls (Table 4). Likelihood ratio testing of nested
models showed that a model with interaction terms of sex and
maternal depression had significantly better fit than the model
without (P < .001), but interaction terms of sex and paternal
depression did not improve the fit (P = .16). Analyses strati-
fied by sex suggested that maternal depression episodes be-
fore birth and during child ages 6 to 10 and 11 to 16 years were
more associated with school performance in girls than in boys.
For example, maternal depression at child ages 11 to 16 years
was associated with lower deciles of school performance of
−0.51 in girls compared with −0.34 in boys.
Discussion
In this study of more than 1 million children from a nation-
wide cohort in Sweden, maternal depression and paternal de-
pression were both independently associated with lower aca-
demicperformanceatchildage16years.Adjustmentforawide
range of covariates attenuated the associations, suggesting the
presence of confounding, although evidence of a parental de-
pression effect remained. Parental depression during mul-
tiple periods of child development was independently asso-
ciated with worse school performance. Magnitudes of the
associations appeared to be modest but of potential signifi-
cance. For example, the effect sizes of parental depression on
school performance are similarly as large as the observed dif-
ference in school performance between the lowest and high-
est quintiles of family income. Finally, child sex modified the
associations of maternal depression such that maternal de-

a Estimates are derived from generalized linear mixed models with a random
effect for birth mother and can be interpreted as the expected difference in
decile of school performance (with 1 being the lowest and 10 being the
highest) associated with any parental depression diagnosis before the
academic start of the child’
s final compulsory education year conditional on
covariates. Model 1 adjusted for child characteristics (sex, multiple births, and
birth year). Model 2 adjusted for model 1 and pregnancy characteristics
(maternal age at birth, birth order, and maternal smoking at the first prenatal
visit). Model 3 adjusted for model 2 and family characteristics (paternal age,
parental education, parental alcohol abuse before the birth of the child,
quintile of annual family income adjusted for year and family size, and parental
region of birth).

pression had a larger negative influence on school perfor-
mance for girls than for boys.
Our findings suggest that both longer-term and shorter-
term pathways may link parental depression with child out-
comes, consistent with prior studies.21,33,49-53 For example,
even after adjusting for depression in later periods, parental
depression before the birth of the child was associated with
worse school performance. This finding supports the conten-
tion that a shared genetic liability may be an important link be-
tween parental depression and child adverse outcomes.21,52,53
Notably, parental depression in all periods after the birth of the
child was associated with worse school performance, suggest-
ing that social pathways also may be involved.
In comparing relative effects of maternal and paternal de-
pression, analysis of the national sample (with half of the cases
identified from inpatient care) suggested that maternal de-
pression and paternal depression had similar associations with
school performance. However, with depression assessed
mostly from outpatient care in the subsample, maternal de-
pression outweighed paternal depression in adverse effects.
This finding suggests that less severe parental depression may
be more detrimental to the child when it occurs in the mother
than in the father, consistent with previous studies.54-56
Our study showed that, on average, maternal depression at
childages6to10and11to16yearshadalargerinfluenceonchild
school performance for girls compared with boys. This finding
isconsistentwiththeresultsofpriorstudies57-59thatsuggestthat

sion. However, we did not find a similar difference of effect by
sex for paternal depression. This finding suggests that parental
depression effects on child school performance are not wholly
duetogeneticliabilitybecauseeffectsshouldbesimilarformoth-
ers and fathers regardless of child sex. One explanation is that
relationships of mothers-daughters and fathers-daughters are
different. The results of a previous study60 suggested that per-

jective assessment of depression without recall bias in a uni-
versal health care system that minimizes disparities in access
to care. This strength is an improvement over prior investiga-
tions that have only examined parental depression diagnoses
during limited periods.
Several limitations must be noted. A substantial limita-
tion is the underdiagnosis of depression because register
diagnoses based on service use always underestimate the
true extent of depression in the population that remains
undiagnosed and untreated. However, it is reassuring that
the subsample analysis (with better ascertainment) also
showed similar adverse effects of parental depression on
school performance. Although we adjusted for multiple
covariates, the fact that the associations were attenuated
after adjustment is a cautionary note that the results may be
affected by residual confounding. In addition, we could not
identify if children were living with the birth parents for the
duration of the study. In Sweden, three-quarters of children
aged 0 to 17 years have a registered address at the same
address as both parents, and 80% of children living in single-
parent households are registered with the mother.62 How-
ever, parents need not be living with the child in order for
parental depression to affect a child. For example, if genetic
mechanisms are at play, then the child does not need to be
exposed to household parental depression in order for
parental depression to influence school performance. In the
case of environmental mechanisms, frequent contact (de-
spite living apart) could equally affect the child, or simply
the knowledge that a parent has mental health issues may
cause worry in a child. Finally, limitations of the data pre-
vented further exploration of mechanistic hypotheses. There
were too few depression diagnoses captured in our data dur-
ing the pregnancy period to assess the effect of prenatal
depression. Similarly, there was insufficient capture of child
psychiatric disorders in the registers to allow for assessment
of potential mediation by child psychiatric health.
Conclusions
Our results suggest that diagnoses of parental depression may
have a far-reaching effect on child development. Because pa-
rentaldepressionmaybemoreamenabletoimprovementcom-
pared with other influences, such as socioeconomic status, it
is worth verifying the present results in independent co-
horts. If the associations observed are causal, the results
strengthen the case even further for intervention and
support among children of affected parents.
