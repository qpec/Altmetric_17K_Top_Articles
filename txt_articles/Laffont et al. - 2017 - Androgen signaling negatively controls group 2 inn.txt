T
ype 2 immune responses are characterized by the secretion of 
IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13. This specific cytokine signature is 
crucial to control parasitic infection but is also associated with 
allergic reactions. 
These responses involve the coordinated ac-
tion of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) andTh2 lym-
phocytes. The ILC2s are rapid and potent producers of the 
type 2 cytokines representing an early source of mediators 
responsible for the initiation of Th2-dependent immune re-
sponses and the rapid elimination of intestinal parasites (Eberl 
et al., 2015; 
Tait 
Wojno and 
Artis, 2016). Indeed, they are widely 
distributed at mucosal surfaces, where they can be activated 
by epithelial stress signals such as thymic stromal lymphopoi-
etin, IL-25, and IL-33 (Schmitz et al., 2005; Bartemes et al., 
2012; Barlow et al., 2013; Imai et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2013; 
Salimi et al., 2013). In response to these stimuli, ILC2s secrete 
large amounts of IL-5, IL-13, and IL-9. The secretion of IL-5 
by ILC2s leads to the recruitment and activation of eosino-
phils and mast cells, whereas IL-13 activates goblet cells and 
mucus production by epithelial cells (Tait Wojno and Artis, 
2016). Moreover, IL-13 production by ILC2s is determinant 
to mount an effective 
Th2 cell response by instructing DCs to 
prime Th2 cells in draining lymph nodes (Halim et al., 2014). 
ILC2s have therefore recently emerged as critical cells in the 
initiation of allergic inflammatory responses such as asthma or 
atopic dermatitis (Halim et al., 2012, 2014; Salimi et al., 2013). 
They also play a key role in protective immunity against par-
asitic helminth infection (Moro et al., 2010; Neill et al., 2010) 
and are associated with metabolic homeostasis (Molofsky et 
al., 2013). Besides cytokines, additional mediators including 
the arachidonic acid metabolites leukotriene D4 (LTD4) and 
prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) appear to be potent regulators of 
ILC2 function (Doherty et al., 2013; Tait Wojno et al., 2015). 
However, our current understanding of the homeostatic reg-
ulation of ILC2 is limited, and whether other endogenous 
factors, such as sex steroid hormones, also influence ILC2 re-
sponses is currently unknown.
Asthma is a hallmark of type 2 immune response– 
mediated disease causing chronic inflammation of the air-
ways (Lambrecht and Hammad, 2015). Both clinical obser-
vations and murine models revealed that asthma incidence, 
prevalence, and severity differ according to sex (Townsend 
Prevalence of asthma is higher in women than in men, but the mechanisms underlying this sex bias are unknown. Group 
2 innate lymphoid cells (ILc2s) are key regulators of type 2 inflammatory responses. Here, we show that ILc2 develop-
ment is greatly influenced by male sex hormones. Male mice have reduced numbers of ILc2 progenitors (ILc2Ps) and 
mature ILc2s in peripheral tissues compared with females. In consequence, males exhibit reduced susceptibility to aller-
gic airway inflammation in response to environmental allergens and less severe IL-33–driven lung inflammation, cor-
relating with an impaired expansion of lung ILc2s. Importantly, orchiectomy, but not ovariectomy, abolishes the sex 
differences in ILc2 development and restores IL-33–mediated lung inflammation. ILc2Ps express the androgen receptor 
(Ar), and Ar signaling inhibits their differentiation into mature ILc2s. Finally, we show that hematopoietic Ar expres-
sion limits IL-33–driven lung inflammation through a cell-intrinsic inhibition of ILc2 expansion. thus, androgens play a 
crucial protective role in type 2 airway inflammation by negatively regulating ILc2 homeostasis, thereby limiting their 
capacity to expand locally in response to IL-33.

et al., 2012). Although males are more susceptible to asthma 
than females in childhood, the onset of puberty reverses that 
trend for most allergic disorders (Carey et al., 2007; Almqvist 
et al., 2008). The drop in asthma incidence observed in and 
around the time of puberty in males is suggestive of a pro-
tective action of male sex hormones (Carey et al., 2007; 
Almqvist et al., 2008). Along the same line, hypogonadism 
has been associated with enhanced susceptibility to asthma 
when compared with men with normal testosterone levels 
(Mulligan et al., 2006). Although these observations support 
a protective role for androgens in the susceptibility to aller-
gic asthma, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this 
 
effect are unknown.
Based on the role of ILC2s in the induction of airway 
inflammation (Halim et al., 2012, 2014; Gold et al., 2014), 
we investigate whether ILC2s could be influenced by sex 
hormones. In this study, we have unraveled a novel level of 
regulation of ILC2 responses. Analysis of multiple tissues from 
both sexes revealed a significantly increased presence of ILC2s 
in females compared with males. Interestingly, this difference 
was not caused by an enhancing effect of estrogens in females, 
but rather to the inhibition of ILC2 maintenance and local 
expansion in males mediated by androgens. As a consequence, 
females developed exacerbated lung inflammation in response 
to house dust mite (HDM) extract or to IL-33 administration. 
Our results demonstrate that androgen receptor (AR) signal-
ing exerts a critical cell-intrinsic role in inhibiting ILC2 dif-
ferentiation and the development of ILC2-dependent type 2 
inflammatory responses in response to IL-33.
resuLts And dIscussIon
Males are less susceptible than females to 
allergic airway inflammation
In an experimental model of ovalbumin-induced asthma, 
airway inflammation is more severe in female mice than 
in male mice (Melgert et al., 2005). We first investigated 
whether such a sex bias was also observed in the more phys-
iological setting of HDM-induced allergic airway inflam-
mation, where the initial immunological challenge occurs 
in the lung in the absence of an adjuvant (Lambrecht and 
Hammad, 2015). Inflammatory leukocyte numbers found in 
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, particularly eosinophils, were 
higher in female mice than in male mice (Fig. 1 A). 
This was 
correlated with enhanced inflammatory infiltrates in the 
lung of female mice (Fig. 1 B). A similar trend was observed 
for all the immunological parameters examined. Serum IgE 
and IgG1 concentrations were strongly up-regulated upon 
HDM challenge. This effect was more robust in female mice 
than in male mice, suggesting that exacerbated type 2 im-
munity preferentially developed in a female sex environ-
ment (Fig. 1 C). Indeed, the numbers of Th2 lymphocytes 
(Fig. 1 D) were markedly higher in the inflammatory lung 
tissues of female mice than in males. Thus, these data re-
vealed a strong female sex bias for all the cardinal features of 
HDM-induced airway inflammation.
sex bias in steady-state ILc2 numbers is controlled 
by male androgen hormone
As ILC2s have been previously reported to play a critical 
role in priming Th2 responses in the HDM-induced asthma 
model (Gold et al., 2014), we next examined whether the 
ILC2 distribution in various organs was subjected to sex dif-
ferences at steady-state. In the lungs, the frequencies and total 
numbers of ILC2s were twofold higher in females than in 
males (Fig. 2 A). These differences in ILC2 numbers were 
accompanied with changes in the expression of phenotypic 
markers. ILC2s from male mice showed an increase in the 
expression of KLRG1 and IL-33 receptor (ST2; Fig. 2, B and 
C), whereas CD25, the high-affinity α chain of the IL-2 re-
ceptor, was similarly expressed between both sexes (Fig. 2 A). 
KLRG1 interactions with E-cadherin expressed on epithe-
lium have been shown to alter ILC2 function and act as a 
suppressive mechanism to dampen down the ILC2 responses 
(Salimi et al., 2013). 
Thus, our data suggest that both develop-
mental and phenotypic differences occur between sexes. Fur-
thermore, these differences in ILC2 extended to other tissues 
in which ILC2 dominate such as the visceral adipose tissues 
(VATs; Fig. 2 D) and mesenteric lymph nodes (Fig. 2 E). In 
VATs, ILC2s are critical regulators of metabolic homeostasis, 
and their loss leads to adiposity and insulin resistance when 
animals are placed on a high-fat diet (Molofsky et al., 2013). 
Our results showing reduced ILC2 numbers in male 
VATs are 
compatible with the observation that males are more vulner-
able to high-fat diet–induced weight gain in terms of onset or 
magnitude (Hwang et al., 2010).
We next investigated the mechanisms that might un-
derpin these sex differences in ILC2s and determined 
whether endogenous estrogens and estrogen receptor (ER) 
signaling were involved in lung ILC2 up-regulation. In ova-
riectomized mice, we could not detect significant changes 
in the frequency of lung ILC2s (Fig. 2 F). T
o exclude any 
potential role of estrogen signaling on ILC2 development or 
maturation, we analyzed the presence of ILC2s in mice that 
specifically lack ERα expression in the hematopoietic lin-
eages. We found similar frequencies of lung ILC2s between 
 
ERαflox/flox × Tie2-Cre mice and their ERαflox/flox control lit-
termates (Fig. 2 G). In contrast, a significant up-regulation in 
ILC2 frequency was observed in the lungs of castrated (Cx) 
males (Fig. 2 H), indicating that male androgen hormones, 
rather than estrogens, were involved in the homeostatic regu-
lation of ILC2 at mucosal surfaces.
Male sex hormones blunt IL-33–driven ILc2 expansion and 
lung inflammation in vivo
Systemic administration of IL-33 induces the proliferation 
of ILC2 and secretion of cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13, 
resulting in lung inflammation (Neill et al., 2010). We there-
fore examined whether sex differences exist in lung inflam-
mation induced by administration of human IL-3395–270, as 
described previously (Lefrançais et al., 2014). In this setting, 
IL-33 strongly increased the number and frequency of ILC2s 
 1583

in the lungs of treated mice compared with PBS-injected 
control mice (Fig. 3, A and B). ILC2 frequencies and num-
bers were however approximately twofold higher in female 
mice than in male mice. The frequency of lung ILC2s that 
positively stained with dead cell–discrimination dye and/or 
Annexin 
V was also determined in control and IL-33–treated 
mice (Fig. S1). As expected, the numbers of dead cells and 
apoptotic cells were significantly increased in lung ILC2s from 
IL-33–treated mice as compared with untreated controls (Fig. 
S1). However, no differences in cell death and apoptosis were 
observed between lung ILC2s isolated from female or male 
mice, both at steady state or upon IL-33 administration (Fig. 
S1). Thus, enhanced apoptosis and/or impaired survival does 
not seem to account for the sex differences in ILC2s at steady 
state and during inflammation.
Interestingly, Cx males responded as intact females, in-
dicating that endogenous male sex hormones act as critical 
regulators of IL-33–driven ILC2 expansion in vivo (Fig. 3, 
A and B). In IL-33–injected mice, there was a marked 
up-regulation (>10-fold) in the frequency of IL-5+IL-13+ 
ILC2s as compared with control mice (Fig. 3 C). Despite 
the lack of significant differences in the proportion of cyto-
kine-producing ILC2s among males, females, and Cx males 
(Fig. 3 C), the absolute numbers of IL-5+IL-13+ ILC2s 
were dramatically increased in females and Cx males com-
pared with intact male mice (Fig. 3 D). This exacerbated 
ILC2 response was correlated with a massive infiltration of 
inflammatory cells around the bronchi and pulmonary ves-
sels (Fig. 3 E). The histological scores in females were sig-
nificantly higher than in intact males. This difference was 
abrogated in Cx males, in which disease scores were sim-
ilar to females (Fig. 3 F). Collectively, these results show 
that ILC2-mediated lung inflammation is more severe in 
female mice than male mice and that orchiectomy abol-
ishes these differences.
Androgens restrain ILc2 development at steady state
As ILC2s develop from the ILC2 progenitor (ILC2P) in the 
bone marrow (Hoyler et al., 2012), we compared ILC2P fre-
quency between sexes. The absolute number and proportion

two- to threefold higher in females than in males (Fig. 4, A

were similar between both sexes (not depicted). Thus, the in-

bone marrow. Contrasting with the lack of differential expres-
sion of CD25 between male and female tissue-resident ILC2s, 
ILC2Ps from female mice expressed a significantly higher 
level of IL2Rα than ILC2Ps from male mice (Fig. 4 C). T
o 
test whether sex-linked factors affect ILC2 proliferation at 
steady state, we examined intracellular expression of Ki67 in 
ILC2Ps and lung ILC2s isolated from male or female mice. 
Whereas Ki67+ cells were detected at low frequency in 
 
ILC2Ps and ILC2s from male mice (ranging from 1–5%), a 
significantly higher proportion of ILC2Ps (Fig. 4 D) and lung 
ILC2s (Fig. 4 E and Fig. S2) positively stained for Ki67 in 
female mice (7–15%). As male sex hormones, rather than es-
trogens, were shown to negatively control ILC2s (Fig. 2), we 
measured the expression profile of sex-steroid hormone re-
ceptors. Accordingly, ILC2Ps primarily expressed transcripts 
encoding for AR, whereas those encoding for the ER (Esr-1 
or Esr-2) genes were almost undetectable (Fig. 4 F). T
o test 
whether androgen signaling influences ILC2 development, 
ILC2Ps were cultured with IL-33 in the absence or presence 
of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or the AR antagonist flut-
amide (Fig. 4, G and H). Interestingly, addition of DHT to the 
culture inhibited ILC2 differentiation after 10 d (Fig. 4 H). 
On the contrary, flutamide increased the numbers of ILC2 
(∼1.3–1.7-fold) that differentiated after 7 to 10 d of culture 
(Fig. 4 H). Of note, KLRG1 expression on developing ILC2 
was down-regulated in flutamide-treated cultures (Fig. 4 I), 
indicating that AR-signaling controls KLRG1 expression in 
male ILC2 as shown in Fig. 2. Thus, androgen actively re-
presses ILC2 development through AR-signaling in ILC2Ps.
Ar negatively controls IL-33–driven ILc2 
expansion and lung inflammation
To evaluate the role of the AR in hematopoietic cells on the 
sex bias in ILC2-mediated lung inflammation, we generated 
bone marrow chimeras. Lethally irradiated C57BL/6 mice, 
from either sex, were engrafted with bone marrow cells from 
WT or AR-deficient (ARKO) littermate male mice, and lung 
inflammation induced by IL-33 injection was monitored as 
described in Fig. 3. The absence of AR in the hematopoietic 
compartment abolished the sex differences in the total num-
bers of inflammatory cells, including eosinophils, in broncho-
alveolar lavage fluid (Fig. 5 A). Lung-infiltrating cells were 
significantly reduced in WT chimeric males compared with 
females, but this sex difference was absent in AR-deficient 
bone marrow chimeras (Fig. 5 B). ILC2 numbers were higher 
in the lungs of male mice engrafted with bone marrow cells 
from ARKO rather than WT mice (Fig. 5 C). KLRG1 expres-
sion was again significantly down-regulated on AR-deficient 
ILC2s, confirming that the differences observed between 
males and females in ILC2 development and phenotype are 
dependent on AR signaling (Fig. 5 D), in agreement with 
the in vitro data in Fig. 4 I. This enhanced responsiveness to 
IL-33–driven lung inflammation in AR-deficient males was 
further confirmed by histological evaluation (Fig. 5, E and 
F). In contrast, AR deficiency in hematopoietic cells had no 
significant impact on lung inflammation in female chimeric 
mice (Fig. 5, E and F). T
o determine whether the deficiency 
in ILC2-driven lung inflammation observed in ARKO male 
was cell intrinsic, mixed bone marrow chimera experiments 
were performed. Lethally irradiated CD45.1 male mice were 
transplanted with an equal mixture of bone marrow cells from 
CD45.1 WT and CD45.2 ARKO mice. After 6 wk of recon-
stitution, the ratio between CD45.1+ (WT) and CD45.1neg 
(ARKO) lung ILC2s was examined after IL-33 injection 
(Fig. 5, G and H). We observed a significant deficiency in the 
proportion of WT ILC2s (CD45.1+) compared with ILC2s 
derived from ARKO progenitors (CD45.1neg; Fig. S3 A), result-
ing in a WT/ARKO ILC2 ratio <0.2 (Fig. 5 G). For compar-
ison, the WT/ARKO ratios for total CD45+ lung infiltrating 
cells or lung eosinophils were >0.7 (Fig. 5 G and Fig. S3 C), 
yet the frequencies of Ki67+ cells and dead cells were similar 
between WT and AR-deficient ILC2s (Fig. S3, B and D). In-
terestingly, in agreement with results in Fig. 5 D, the reduced 
expression of KLRG1 in AR-deficient ILC2s was maintained 
in the mixed chimeras (Fig. 5 H). Altogether, these results 
indicate that endogenous androgens signal through hemato-
poietic ARs in a cell-intrinsic manner to control the level of 
ILC2 responsiveness in the lung. As ILC2 survival and pro-
liferation were not affected by AR deficiency, these results 
suggest a major effect of androgen signaling on the regulation 
of tissue-resident ILC2 numbers at steady-state.
The prevalence of asthma is consistently reported to be 
higher in boys than in girls (Carey et al., 2007; Almqvist et 
al., 2008). This pattern changes during adolescence, where 
the onset of asthma becomes much less prevalent in males 
than in females. However, the mechanism underpinning 
this transition is unknown. Our results indicate that andro-
gen-mediated regulation of ILC2-dependent Th2 responses 
to environmental allergens could contribute to this switch 
around puberty. At steady-state, we observed a strong sex bias 
in ILC2 numbers, with an increased representation of ILC2s 
in various tissues, including lung, fat, and mesenteric lymph 
nodes. This was associated with a strong up-regulation of 
 
ILC2Ps in the bone marrow of female compared with male 
mice. Accumulating evidence indicates that male androgens 
are immunosuppressive, whereas female estrogens may pro-
mote innate and adaptive immunity (Markle and Fish, 2014). 
We excluded a positive impact of estrogens in this sex bias, 
as ovariectomy or selective ablation of Esr-1 gene in the he-
matopoietic compartment had no effect on the number and 
phenotype of lung ILC2s at steady state. In contrast, orchi-
ectomy abolished this sex difference, indicating that endog-
enous androgens may negatively regulate ILC2 development 
and/or expansion in vivo. Analysis of sex hormone receptor 
expression in ILC2Ps demonstrated a selective expression of 
Ar gene mRNA, whereas those encoding for the ERs Esr-1 
or Esr-2 were barely detected. This observation is in agree-
ment with recent studies showing that Ar is highly expressed 
in tissue-resident ILC2s and has been classified as a prototypic 
ILC2 signature gene (Robinette et al., 2015), highly conserved 
 1587

during evolution (Vivier et al., 2016). In favor of a unique 
role for the male sex hormone androgen in the regulation 
of ILC2-dependent responses, we showed that orchiectomy 
or AR deficiency in hematopoietic cells both abolished all 
phenotypic changes in IL-33–mediated lung inflammation. 
These results strongly suggest that ligand-induced activation 
of AR within ILC2s is the main signaling pathway contribut-
ing to the sex differences in this model. Indeed, we provided 
evidence for AR-dependent regulation of IL-33–driven ILC2 
differentiation and expansion in vitro and demonstrated using 
mixed chimeras the cell-intrinsic requirement of AR for the 
inhibition of IL-33–mediated ILC2 expansion in vivo.
Although previous studies suggested that female sex 
hormones might contribute to the sex differences in aller-
gic asthma (Keselman and Heller, 2015), our results are the 
first to establish that male androgen hormones protect from 
ILC2-driven lung inflammation. Developing ILC2s them-
selves or their progenitors seems to represent the direct target 
of androgens. Cell-intrinsic 
AR signaling in ILC2Ps appears to 
promote the development of KLRG1hi ILC2s, which are less

frequent in female mice or Cx males. 
These cells, however, are 
unlikely to represent the KLRG1hi inflammatory ILC2 popu-
lation, which is mobilized by IL-25 or infection, as these cells, 
unlike steady-state ILC2s, lacked ST2 and did not proliferate 
in response to IL-33 (Huang et al., 2015). Thus, we propose 
that androgen signaling may directly regulate the develop-
ment of natural ILC2s. However, as very few ILC2s develop 
from bone marrow progenitors in adult mice (Gasteiger et al., 
2015), we believe that most of the sex differences observed in 
the IL-33–driven inflammation model are already imprinted 
by the preexisting sex bias in tissue-resident ILC2s reflected 
in the steady-state numbers. Enhanced CD25 expression in 
female ILC2Ps correlated with an increased frequency of 
proliferating (Ki67+) cells, suggesting that greater sensitiv-
ity to IL-2 in female ILC2Ps could promote ILC2 seeding 
in nonlymphoid tissues during ontogeny. This hypothesis is 
however not supported by recent findings demonstrating that 
CD25-deficient tissue-resident ILC2s proliferated to a similar

extent as WT ILC2s in bone marrow chimeric mice, both at 
steady state and during acute helminth infection (Gasteiger 
et al., 2015). Although the environmental cues that orches-
trate the sex bias in tissue-resident ILC2 at steady-state still 
need to be identified, we cannot exclude that androgen sig-
naling might also act by altering the IL-2/CD25-dependent 
regulation of ILC2 effector function during inflammation 
(Gasteiger et al., 2015).
AR is a ligand-dependent transcription factor, which 
could directly or indirectly regulate the expression of key tran-
scription factors or molecules involved in the maintenance of 
ILC2Ps or essential for their differentiation into ILC2s. Such 
specific downstream targets of ARs in ILC2Ps remain to be 
identified. Alternatively, AR signaling may regulate the IL-33 
signaling machinery via the down-regulation of NF-κB or 
AP-1 pathways, resulting in reduced cell proliferation. Studies 
of the T cell differentiation pathways suggested that testos-
terone inhibited CD4 T cell differentiation by up-regulating 
the phosphatase Ptpn1, which dephosphorylates T
yk2, the 
upstream kinase responsible for IL-12–induced Stat-4 phos-
phorylation, thereby inhibiting Th1 polarization (Kissick et 
al., 2014). Whether altered IL-33 signaling occurs in andro-
gen-stimulated ILC2s will require further investigation.
Our study suggests that androgen therapy could be use-
ful to protect against allergic diseases through its inhibitory 
action on ILC2s. Androgen replacement therapy is currently 
used for the treatment of subjects with deficient testicular 
function, and administration of dehydroepiandrosterone, a 
weak androgen with fewer virilizing side effects, has shown 
some beneficial actions in the treatment of allergic asthma 
in humans (Shah, 2004; Wenzel et al., 2010) and mice (Liou 
and Huang, 2011). Understanding further how AR signals in 
ILC2s or their progenitors may provide new therapeutics or 
downstream targets for the treatment of allergic diseases while 
minimizing the side effects of androgen therapy.
MAterIALs And MetHods
Mice
Female and male C57BL/6JRJ (B6) mice were purchased from 
the Centre d’Elevage R. Janvier or the Walter and Eliza Hall 
Institute of Medical Research. Congenic C57BL/6-Ly5.1 
(CD45.1) mice were purchased from Charles River. Mice 
were used at 8–12 wk old unless otherwise stated. Bilateral 
orchiectomy and ovariectomy were performed in anesthe-
tized 4–5-wk-old mice. Mice were then rested for a period 
of 5–6 wk before use. Mice selectively lacking ERα in the 
hematopoietic compartment (ERαfl/fl × Tie2-Cre) have been 
described elsewhere (Lélu et al., 2011). Mice lacking AR have 
been described previously (Sato et al., 2004). ARL−/+ females 
on a B6 background, bearing one AR-null allele, were bred 
with WT B6 males to produce ARKO (ARL−/y) and AR+/y 
male mice. ARL−/+ and ERαfl/fl mice were provided by S. 
Kato (Iwaki Meisei University, Iwaki, Japan) and P
. Chambon 
(IGB 
MC, Illkirch-Graffenstaden, France), respectively. For 
the generation of irradiation bone marrow chimeras, mice 
were γ-irradiated (11 Gy, 137Cs source) and engrafted with 5 
× 106 to 10 × 106 bone marrow cells/mouse. Mice were used 
6–8 wk after reconstitution. Mice were housed in specific 
pathogen–free conditions and handled in accordance with 
the Animal Care and Use of Laboratory Animal guidelines 
of the French Ministry of Research (study approval number 
05187.01), the National Health and Medical Research Coun-
cil Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Sci-
entific Purposes guidelines and were approved by the Walter 
and Eliza Hall Institute Animal Ethics Committee.
HdM-induced allergic asthma and IL-33 injection
HDMs (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus extracts; Greer 
Laboratories) were used to induce allergic airway inflam-
mation. Mice were sensitized intranasally with 1 µg HDM 
extracts on day 0 and subsequently challenged with 10 µg/
mouse on days 7–11. Six days after the last challenge, lungs, 
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and serum were collected for 
flow cytometry, histological analysis, and ELI 
SA. Human re-
combinant IL-33 injections were performed as described pre-
viously (Lefrançais et al., 2014), with some modification. In 
brief, mice were treated intraperitoneally with 4 µg recom-
binant human IL-3395–270 for two consecutive days and then 
left untreated for 2 d and injected again for three consecutive 
days. 24 h after the last injection, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 
and lungs were collected for flow cytometry and histological 
analyses. Recombinant human IL-3395–270 was produced as 
described previously (Lefrançais et al., 2014).
tissue preparation
Lungs were cut into small fragments and digested for 30 min at 
37°C with 1 mg/ml Collagenase III (Worthington Biochem-
ical Corporation) and 200 µg/ml DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich). 
Red blood cells were lysed by treatment with hypotonic solu-
tion and then filtered. Perigonadal adipose tissue was used as 
representative 
VAT. Adipose tissue was finely dissected with a 
scalpel blade and digested in 3 ml PBS containing 0.2 mg/ml 
Collagenase III (Worthington Biochemical Corporation) and 
4% BSA at 37°C for 30 min with gentle agitation. Digests were 
filtered through 70-µm sterile cell strainers and centrifuged at 
800 g for 15 min to enrich for immune cells in stromal vas-
cular fractions. Single-cell suspensions were blocked with PBS 
containing 5 µg/ml anti-CD16/CD32 (2.4G2) and stained 
for 30 min on ice with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies. 
The following antibodies, purchased from BD, were used for 
the identification and purification of ILC2s: CD19 (ID3), 
B220 (RA3-6B2), CD3 (145-2C110), CD4 (GK1.5), CD11b 
(M1/70), CD11c (HL3), Gr-1 (RB6-8C5), 
TCRβ (H57-597), 
NKp46 (29A1.4), NK1.1 (PK136), CD45.1 (A20), CD45.2 
(104), CD117 (2B8), CD127 (A7R34), Sca1 (E13-161.7), 
KLRG1 (2F1), Thy1.2 (30H12), and ST2 (DJ8 or RMST2-
2). Intracellular staining was performed using the Transcrip-
tion Factor Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience) and monoclonal 
antibodies to Gata-3 (TWAJ), IL-13 (eBio13A), and IL-5 
(TRFK5). Intracellular cytokine staining for IL-13 and IL-5

was performed after stimulation for 4 h with 50 ng/ml PMA 
and 100 ng/ml ionomycin in the presence of 1 µg/ml Brefel-
din A. Ki67-staining analysis (BD) and Annexin V staining 
analysis (eBioscience) were performed according to the man-
ufacturer’s protocol. Cells were analyzed using a Fortessa (BD), 
and FlowJo software (Tree Star) was used for analysis. Flow 
cytometric sorting was performed with a FACS Aria (BD).
ILc2 differentiation
To induce ILC2 differentiation in vitro, cell-sorted ILC2Ps 
from female bone marrow cells were cultured for 7 d in 
α-MEM complete medium (10% heat-inactivated FCS) on 
OP9-DL1 with 10 ng/ml each of SCF
, IL-7, and IL-33. 5-α 
DHT (Sigma-Aldrich) or the AR antagonist flutamide (Sig-
ma-Aldrich) were diluted in methanol, respectively at 10−2 M 
and 10−3 M, to generate a stock solution and then added at 
the indicated concentration on day 0, +4, and +7 of culture.
Hormone receptor expression 
determined by rnA sequencing
RNA was isolated from ex vivo ILC2Ps from female WT 
bone marrow using the QIA 
GEN RNeasy Micro kit. Librar-
ies were generated using the Illumina Truseq RNA sample 
preparation kit following the manufacturer’s instructions and 
subjected to a transcriptome 75-bp paired-end sequencing 
on an Illumina Next-Seq instrument. Sequence reads were 
aligned to the GRCm38/mm10 build of the Mus musculus 
genome using the Subread aligner (Liao et al., 2013). Only 
uniquely mapped reads were retained. Genewise counts were 
obtained using featureCounts (Liao et al., 2014). RNA se-
quencing data have been deposited in the National Center 
for Biotechnology Information’s Gene Expression Omnibus 
and are accessible under accession number GSE97354.
Lung histology and May–Grünwald–Giemsa (MGG) staining
Lung tissue was fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 24 h and 
then placed in ethanol 70% before embedding in paraffin. 
4-µm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin 
(H&E). Histological disease scores from 0 to 3 were attributed 
based on the severity of peribronchial, perivascular, and inter-
stitial immune cell infiltration, together with thickening of 
peribronchial epithelium, resulting in a maximum score of 12. 
MGG staining of BAL cells were performed using a standard 
procedure. All scores were attributed on a blinded basis.

For serum IgG1 quantification, rat anti–mouse IgG1 (LO-
MG1-13; AbD Serotec) antibody was used for coating and 
rat anti–mouse/HRP (LO-MK-1; AbD Serotec) was used 
for the secondary detection step. For IgE, rat anti–mouse 
IgE (LO-ME-3; Serotec) antibody was used for coat-
ing. Biotin-conjugated rat anti–mouse IgE mAb (BD) and 
streptavidin–HRP conjugate (GE Healthcare) were used for 
detection. Quantification standards were established using 
mouse IgG1 and IgE mAb (Serotec).
statistical analysis
For all experiments, the difference between two groups was 
calculated with the Student t test using GraphPad Software 
Prism 4. ANO 
VA and Bonferroni’s test were used for multi-
ple comparisons (*, P ≤ 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ns,
