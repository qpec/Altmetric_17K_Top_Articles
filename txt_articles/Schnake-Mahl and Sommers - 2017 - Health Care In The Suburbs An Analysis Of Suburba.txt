ABSTRACT 
 
There are 16.9 million Americans living in poverty in the suburbs—more than in cities or rural 
communities. Despite recent increases in suburban poverty, the perception of the suburbs as 
areas of uniform affluence remains, and there has been little research into health care barriers 
experienced by people living in these areas. The objectives of this study were to compare 
patterns of insurance coverage and health care access in suburban, urban, and rural areas using 
national survey data from 2005 to 2015 and to compare outcomes by geography before and after 
the Affordable Care Act took effect. We found that nearly 40 percent of the uninsured population 
lived in suburban areas. Though unadjusted rates of health care access were better in suburban 
areas, compared to urban and rural communities, this advantage was greatly reduced after 
income and other demographics are accounted for. Overall, a substantial portion of the US 
population residing in the suburbs lacked health insurance and experienced difficulties accessing 
care. Increased policy attention is needed to address these challenges for vulnerable populations 
living in the suburbs.

INTRODUCTION 
To many people, “suburbs” suggest sprawling post–World War II neighborhoods of 
predominantly white middle- and upper-class communities.1 This narrative persists, despite some 
heterogeneity in suburban populations and community types that has always existed in the 
suburbs2 and despite recent shifts in the geography of poverty and affluence in the 
United States.3,4 In fact, while rates of poverty are higher in cities, more poor Americans live in 
the suburbs than in cities or rural communities.4 In the 2000s the number of poor residents in the 
suburbs of the largest metropolitan areas rose by 6.7 million, and by 2014 their number had 
reached 16.9 million—3 million more than the number of poor residents in urban areas.5 
In the latter half of the twentieth century, the suburbs were home to predominantly white 
and relatively affluent populations. These residential patterns arose largely as a result of 
discriminatory housing policies and practices that incentivized whites’ suburban homeownership 
and residence, to the exclusion of other racial groups.1 However, in recent years the suburbs have 
become home to populations of increasing economic and racial/ethnic diversity, because of 
several factors: economic restructuring during and after the great recession, a “return to the city” 
trend among Millennials and empty nesters and subsequent pricing out of lower-income families, 
more affordable suburban housing options, and direct international immigration to suburban 
communities.2  
Historically, rates of health insurance coverage have been higher in suburban areas than 
urban or rural areas,6 but the recent rapid uptick in suburban poverty has likely affected 
uninsurance rates in the suburbs, as people living below poverty are at high risk of being 
uninsured.7 
  
4 
Additionally, substantial suburban unemployment and the rising number of immigrants in 
suburbs may contribute further to coverage challenges among suburbanites.7,8 Yet these issues 
have received little attention from health services researchers and policy makers. 
Suburban residents, particularly those with lower incomes, may face unique barriers to 
health care access beyond simply lacking cover-age. Research has shown that residential context 
affects well-being and community health by shaping access and exposure to education, housing, 
social networks, transportation, employment, and health care.9 However, knowledge of how 
suburban poverty affects health is limited. While suburban poverty has become an area of 
increased policy interest, its implications for health remain unclear. To our knowledge, there has 
been limited research on the implications of the increasingly poor suburban population for health 
care access. 
Other studies have highlighted the challenges of suburban poverty for social services, 
governance, institutions, and community-based programs.10,11 In particular, organizational 
resources targeted to the poor are more limited in suburban areas than elsewhere.12 While 
suburban social service providers have to cover larger delivery service areas than in urban areas, 
they now also face increased demand for services, which has risen rapidly since the recession.13 
Additionally, despite substantial research on the impacts of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for 
insurance and health care access,14,15 studies have not examined recent changes in these out-
comes in suburban areas. 
The objectives of this study were to compare patterns of insurance coverage and health 
care access in suburban, urban, and rural areas using national survey data from 2005 to 2015, and 
to compare outcomes by geography before and after the ACA took effect. We also conducted a 
subgroup analysis of these changes among low-income populations in these different 
  
5 
geographies. We hypothesized that contrary to wide-spread assumptions about residents of 
suburbs, health care coverage and access to care are not substantially better in suburban areas 
than in rural or urban areas, though we hypothesized that these outcomes have improved in all 
three areas since the ACA’s implementation.14,15 
 
 
METHODS 
STUDY POPULATION AND METHODS  
Our study used data from the 2005–15 waves of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance 
System (BRFSS), an annual national cross-sectional telephone survey of non institutionalized 
adults over age eighteen.16 With support from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
and conducted at the state level, the BRFSS is the only publicly available, nationally 
representative survey that has both state and sub-state geographic identifiers and questions on 
health insurance and access to health care. Details about its methodology are available 
elsewhere.16  
 
SUBURBAN DEFINITION 
There is no gold standard or official definition of the suburbs. The Census Bureau defines 
suburbs as municipalities with more than 2,500 people in a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) 
but located outside of census-identified “principal cities.” Other research on suburban poverty 
has used variations of this definition.2,3,17 Across definitions, the finding of a general trend of 
increasing suburban poverty at the national level holds.3 However, there are substantial inter 
suburban differences in levels of poverty, even in neighboring areas.2  
  
6 
The BRFSS data set includes an indicator for Metropolitan status code, which is based on 
MSAs, or regions that generally include a central city, its suburbs, and other economically or 
socially linked communities. The Metropolitan status code indicator includes the following 
categories: center city of an MSA; outside the center city of an MSA but inside the county 
containing the center city; inside a suburban county of the MSA; in an MSA that has no center 
city; and not in an MSA. Our definition, referred to as Definition 1, is similar to the census 
definition, defining urban as the center city only. Suburban includes areas outside the center city 
of an MSA but inside the county containing the center city, as well as areas inside a suburban 
county of the MSA. Rural areas are those not within an MSA. 
 
SAMPLE  
Our sample contained nonelderly adults ages 18–64 (n = 3,259,300) in all fifty states. We 
excluded elderly adults because 98.9 percent are covered by Medicare. Additionally, we 
excluded 1,929 observations (<0:001 percent) from 2005 to 2011 that were missing Metropolitan 
status codes, since it is the main variable of interest. Finally, we included only the landline 
sample from the 2011–15 waves, excluding 555,851 cell-phone observations. In 2011 the 
BRFSS changed its sampling methodology to include cell phones, but cellphone observations 
lack a geographic indicator for Metropolitan status code. The 2015 BRFSS wave contains 1,906 
observations collected in early 2016, which we included as part of our 2015 estimates; all other 
estimates refer to the year in which the survey was conducted.  
 
OUTCOME VARIABLES  
Following previous research using data from the BRFSS,18 we assessed access to health 
  
7 
insurance coverage and access to health care using four measures: being uninsured, having no 
usual source of care (defined as lacking one or more personal doctors or health care providers), 
having an unmet care need due to cost in the past year, and having no receipt of a routine 
checkup in the past year. We modeled all of these outcomes as dichotomous, and all were 
defined so that higher values were worse (for example, percentage uninsured or without a usual 
source of care). 
 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
We first compared the basic demographics of urban, suburban, and rural areas. Then we 
assessed changes over time in coverage and access for the three types of areas. Finally, we used 
logistic regression models to examine the association between the outcomes (access measures) 
and the three geographic areas, before and after adjustment for demographic factors (age, sex, 
race, ethnicity, marital status, education), employment, household income, survey year, and state 
of residence. 
To estimate differential effects of the ACA associated with each of the three types of 
areas, we compared outcomes in the areas pre (2005–13) and post ACA (2014–15), also 
adjusting for a linear time trend and the additional covariates described above. For all regression 
analyses, we reported the odds ratio (OR) and p value. Analyses with associated 95% confidence 
intervals are in online Appendix Exhibits A1 and A2.19 We also produced predicted probabilities, 
calculated using Stata’s “margins” command, for ease of interpretation. We stratified adjusted 
estimates into poor and nonpoor individuals (as described below), to assess for differential 
patterns by geography and poverty status. 
We conducted additional analyses to test the sensitivity of our results to alternative 
  
8 
definitions of suburban, as described in Appendix Exhibit A3.19 Family income was calculated as 
a percentage of the federal poverty level, based on annual income and the number of people in 
each family. We created the following income categories: poor (under 100 percent of poverty), 
near-poor (100–199 percent), middle class (200–299 percent), upper middle (300–399 percent), 
upper (400 percent or more), and income missing (12.2 percent of the data set). Observations 
with missing outcome responses were omitted from the sample for that particular analysis. 
For all analyses, urban geography was the reference group. 
The data were analyzed using Stata/SE 13.1. Analyses accounted for the BRFSS’s 
complex survey design and used nationally representative survey weights. We also tested the 
effect of using robust standard errors clustering at the level of state-geography (for example, 
suburban areas in Massachusetts would be one cluster) in lieu of BRFSS survey-based standard 
errors. 
 
Limitations  
Although our study provides important comparisons of health care access in 
suburban, urban, and rural areas, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, our sample 
included only nonelderly adults, while other research in this area has not been age restricted. 
This limits comparison of our work with other reports. 
Second, though the study relied on survey data, previous research has found high levels 
of reliability and validity for the BRFSS health care access questions.18 Third, our household 
income measure was imprecise, since it was self-reported and measured in income categories 
rather than exact amounts; in addition, 12.2 percent of our sample did not provide any response 
to the income question. In our data, those with those with missing income were significantly 
  
9 
more likely than others to be uninsured and have no usual source of care (p < 0:001); thus, if 
anything, this omission may have led us to underestimate the suburban health care barriers in our 
sample. 
Fourth, we excluded cell-phone respondents from our sample because data on our 
primary exposure, the geographic indicator, is lacking for this group. Fortunately, even after we 
excluded cell-phone respondents, the overall trend in the insurance rate in our data was similar to 
those found in other surveys of national insurance rates.7 Cell-phone use is more prevalent 
among low-income households.20 Therefore, our use of the landline-only sample may also 
have led to an underestimate of poverty rates and barriers to care. 
Fifth, our assessment of changes after ACA implementation in 2014 are largely 
descriptive. We could not determine whether these changes in coverage rates were related 
directly to the ACA’s coverage expansions or were due to unmeasured confounders. However, 
we did control for several potential confounders, including income, age, state, and the pre-2014 
time trend. 
Finally, the percentage of Asian respondents in the BRFSS is smaller than their 
representation in the US population, and the BRFSS does not include questions for nativity or 
immigration status. This is a potentially important factor, given that the share of suburban 
immigrants living in the largest metro areas increased from 56 percent to 61 percent between 
2000 and 2013— more than a 30 percent increase in the number of immigrants in the 
suburbs21—and that immigrants experience greater access challenges than their native-born 
counterparts.8 Though controlling for race, ethnicity, and other demographic factors should 
partially account for selective migration effects, future research on access challenges 
for immigrants in the suburbs would be informative.

RESULTS 
Our final data set included 2,701,520 observations. Exhibit 1 presents our descriptive 
analyses for suburban, urban and rural areas. Most demographic characteristics were similar 
across geographic area types. The largest portion of the population lived in the suburbs, and the 
smallest in rural areas. Educational attainment was highest in suburban areas, followed by urban. 
Our data show a greater percentage of non-Hispanic whites in suburban and rural locations, a 
lower rate of married individuals in urban areas, and a lower poverty rate in the suburbs. 
 
URBAN, SUBURBAN, AND RURAL LEVELS OF COVERAGE AND ACCESS  
We found that the suburbs were home to 43.9 percent of the population (Exhibit 1) and 
38 percent of the uninsured population, based on an uninsurance rate of 15 percent. Exhibit 2 
presents time trends of the mean uninsurance rate in the three geographic area types. Across all 
three, the trend was essentially flat from 2005 to 2010, after which the rate decreased. The 
uninsurance rate was initially lower in the suburbs, though the gap narrowed over time; by 2015 
the rate in suburban areas was essentially the same as in urban areas. 
Appendix Exhibits A4–A6 contain the time trends for three of the four access measures: 
having no usual source of care, having an unmet care need due to cost in the past year, and not 
receiving a routine checkup in the past year.19 For all three of these outcomes, the rates decreased 
across all geographic areas after 2014; by 2015 the gaps between urban and suburban areas had 
been eliminated for the first two measures.  
 
REGRESSION RESULTS 
  
11 
Exhibit 3 presents our unadjusted, adjusted, and income-stratified regression estimates. 
Unadjusted rates for the suburbs were significantly lower in three of the four outcomes—being 
uninsured, having no usual source of care, and delaying care because of cost—than in urban 
areas. Across most outcomes, outcome rates were highest (worst) in rural areas. Access rates and 
the size of the disparity between suburban and other geographic areas differed by outcome; for 
example, the absolute difference between urban and rural areas was 4.5 percentage points for 
lacking a usual source of care, compared to 2.4 percentage points for delaying care because of 
cost. 
The adjusted predicted probability of being uninsured was high across all geographic 
areas: over 15 percent overall and over 40 percent among the poor. The adjusted probability of 
having no usual source of care in the suburbs was 20.1 percent, and for no receipt of a routine 
checkup in the suburbs it was 34.7 percent. The suburban advantage for these outcomes 
was greatly attenuated after adjustment for income and other demographics; in fact, the odds 
of being uninsured were significantly higher for suburbs than urban areas after adjustment (OR: 
1.027; p < 0:05).  
Meanwhile, not surprisingly, access and coverage barriers were more common for poor 
adults than for higher-income adults, with odds ratios on “poor” ranging from 1.7 for no checkup 
to 8.14 for being uninsured. Among poor adults, the odds of the outcomes were close to 1.0 
across geographic area types and were significantly higher in suburban areas for being uninsured. 
Thus, poor adults in the suburbs fared similarly to their poor counterparts in urban and rural 
areas. Overall, this indicates that sizable barriers to coverage and access exist among people in 
different income categories. After adjustment, 36.4 percent of low-income suburbanites had 
an unmet need due to cost, and 42.4 percent had not had a recent check-up, compared to 
  
12 
15.7 percent and 34.7 percent for the full suburban population, respectively. 
Exhibit 4 compares outcomes in each type of geographic region before and after 
implementation of the ACA. In all three types of areas, our coverage and access outcomes 
significantly improved in the post-ACA period. For suburban areas, there was a 3.8-percentage-
point drop in the uninsurance rate in the post ACA period compared to the pre-ACA trend; for 
urban areas, the comparable estimate was 4.6 percentage points, and for rural areas, it was 4.2 
percentage points.  
Sensitivity analyses with alternative definitions for suburban are in Appendix Exhibits 
A7 and A8, and analyses with standard errors clustered by state-geography are in Appendix 
Exhibit A9.19 Across these models, rates of coverage and access challenges remained high 
among low income adults in suburban areas, similar to those in urban and rural areas. 
 
DISCUSSION 
In this national study of patterns of health care access and insurance coverage, we found 
that people living in suburban areas encounter substantial barriers to care. Although the suburbs 
do have a small advantage over urban and rural areas for our unadjusted study measures, overall 
uninsurance rates there were not low, and access barriers were quite common, particularly for 
low-income adults. After adjustment for demographic differences by area, rates of access to care 
were similar across all geographic areas. This implies that living in the suburbs provides little if 
any protective effect, after income and other demographic features are taken into account. 
Overall, nearly 40 percent of the uninsured population in the United States lives in the 
suburbs, and though the uninsurance rate is lower in suburban areas than in urban and rural 
locations, they are nonetheless substantial: Nearly one of every seven suburban residents is 
  
13 
uninsured. Furthermore, as the overall uninsurance rate in the United States decreased and access 
improved in recent years, in large part because of the ACA,14,15 we found that the coverage and 
access gaps between urban and suburban areas essentially disappeared by 2015. Our analysis 
comparing the pre- and post-ACA periods appears to show differential change post ACA 
across these geographic areas, wherein coverage gains were greater in urban than suburban areas 
for some access measures. Despite improvements in access and coverage after the ACA took 
effect, our results also suggest that sizable barriers remain and that, if anything, gains may 
have been more limited in suburban areas. 
 
IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY 
Our results show a large affordability gap based on income, with substantially worse 
access rates for the poor than the nonpoor across all geographies. Poverty in the suburbs likely 
poses unique challenges and consequences for residents, particularly for low-income and 
uninsured residents who seek care from the health care safety-net. Safety-net providers deliver 
care to uninsured, low-income, and other vulnerable populations, and as these populations 
increase in a geographic area, local need for these services also likely rises. Though our results 
do not enable us to comment directly on this issue, there is reason to suspect that unique 
nonfinancial barriers to care may exist in the suburbs, which may require different solutions than 
those needed in urban or rural areas. Previous research shows that even after area poverty rates 
are controlled for, services and publicly funded infrastructure targeted to the poor are scarce in 
many suburban areas.22 For instance, there are important gaps in the availability of health care 
services such as mental health, substance abuse treatment, and hospitals in suburban areas.23 And 
though care systems and provider networks are often and increasingly located in high-income 
  
14 
suburban areas with large privately insured populations,11 many suburban physicians are less 
willing than their urban counterparts are to treat the uninsured and Medicaid beneficiaries, 
leaving poor suburban residents with limited options for physician care.23 
Most policy approaches to bolster the health care safety net overlook the suburbs, 
focusing on urban and rural areas, which historically have had the greatest need. Many expansive 
suburban areas with large poor populations have few community health centers (CHCs) and 
small free clinics available.23 While some federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) are in some 
suburban areas, expanding FQHC capacity in areas with growing needs can be difficult. Location 
and funding for these health centers are dependent on Medically Underserved Area/Population 
(MUA/MUP) designation from the Health Resources and Services Administration, which 
is determined based on a metric combining area-level percentage of residents living in poverty 
and other indicators of care access and need. There are reports that some suburban areas 
attempting to gain MUA/MUP designation or establish FQHCs have been unable to do so 
because poor areas were balanced out by more affluent areas in the same census tract or because 
there were several large hospitals in the areas, giving the statistical appearance of sufficient 
provider capacity.23,24 
Given the lack of health centers in suburban areas, emergency departments are often the 
Even accessing hospital or emergency care can be difficult for this population because of 
insufficient availability of safety-net hospitals, especially in high-poverty suburbs.11 Because 
fewer suburban providers appear to be willing to treat uninsured patients, suburban patients often 
must travel long distances to urban safety-net providers.25 On a broader scale, limited public 
transportation systems and sprawl in the suburbs may present unique barriers to low-income 
patients, given the long distances they must travel to obtain care. 
  
15 
Current policies that identify areas of medical need and determine safety-net location 
have not adapted to shifts in the geography of poverty, which makes it difficult to locate services 
and providers in suburban areas with high levels of need for free or low-cost care. Recent 
proposals by some states to limit medical transportation services in Medicaid26 in particular 
could hamper access to care for suburban populations. 
More generally, access and insurance gains post ACA were more limited in states that 
chose not to expand Medicaid.15 We found that 68 percent of the suburban population resided in 
expansion states, compared to 54 percent among rural populations and 42 percent among urban 
populations. The larger representation of suburban areas in expansion states indicates the 
importance of the ACA Medicaid expansion for the suburban population, along with the 
potential coverage and access losses if the expansion is repealed. Despite this disproportionate 
presence of suburbanites in expansion states, our findings indicate that the ACA has not 
differentially improved coverage and access for those in the suburbs. 
 
IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH 
Most studies and reports on geographic disparities present urban-rural differences in 
health care access and outcomes, lumping suburban areas in with urban areas. For instance, a 
2017 study comparing urban versus rural coverage rates in Medicaid expansion and non- 
expansion states found that expansion increased the likelihood of insurance for low-income 
populations in both areas.27 Our study points to the need to consider suburban populations as 
well, particularly if the suburban poor population continues to increase. The potential technical 
differences in definition of suburban did not have a major impact on the trends identified in our 
analysis. Thus, which definition is used appears to be less critical than ensuring the identification 
  
16 
of the suburbs as a geography independent of urban or rural areas. Such disaggregation by 
geography in survey design and data analysis is imperative for identifying, monitoring, and 
attempting to eliminate health disparities between populations living in different types of 
geographic areas. Given the heterogeneity that exists between types of suburbs, and the 
importance of census tract or area poverty level on service availability,22 future research should 
also consider how differences in income levels within suburbs may affect access to care. 
Given our data set, our analysis was able to examine only family-level poverty in assessing 
barriers to care. But poor neighborhoods themselves have critical implications for health and care 
access. Areas of concentrated poverty (that is, with poverty rates exceeding 40 percent) are 
beginning to present challenges to suburbia.28 Patterns of racial inequality typically seen in cities 
are being replicated in the suburbs, with suburban low-income communities of color facing low-
performing schools, poor public transport, limited economic opportunity, and minimal municipal 
capacity or motivation to address poverty.4 These worrisome patterns reveal that more research is 
needed on the implications of concentrated suburban poverty and differential effects of suburban 
poverty by individual and community racial/ethnic composition. 
 
Conclusion 
This article contributes to a preliminary understanding of patterns of insurance coverage 
and access to care across suburban, urban, and rural areas of the United States. Our findings that 
nearly 40 percent of the uninsured live in the suburbs and that almost one in seven suburban 
residents is uninsured highlight the need for additional research in this area. We have shed 
some light on the large and growing number of poor Americans living in the suburbs, many 
of whom lack health insurance and experience difficulty gaining access to care. Overlooking the 
  
17 
challenges faced by some residents of suburban areas—in particular, those with low incomes— 
ignores a large segment of the population. Increased attention to these issues will be critical to 
identifying the unique features of the suburbs that may present challenges to the health care 
safety net in serving vulnerable populations.

Appendix Exhibit A3: Alternative Definitions of Suburban Areas 
Definition 2:  
• “Urban” includes both the center city and area within a county with a center city that is 
urban. “Suburban” includes only suburban counties of an MSA (similar to definition 
by Allard and Roth). Rural” is defined as not within a MSA.  
Definition 3:  
• Urban” is limited to the center city of an MSA, while the suburbs are divided into two 
categories – the inner suburb that is beyond the city center but with the county 
containing the center city, and the outer suburb, which is any suburban county of the 
MSA. Rural” is defined as not within a MSA.
