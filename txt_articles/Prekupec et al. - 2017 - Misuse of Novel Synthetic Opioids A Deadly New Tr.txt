 Misuse of Novel Synthetic Opioids: A Deadly New Trend
Matthew P. Prekupec, MD, Peter A. Mansky, MD, and Michael H. Baumann, PhD
Novel synthetic opioids (NSOs) include various analogs of fentanyl
and newly emerging non-fentanyl compounds. Together with illic-
itly manufactured fentanyl (IMF), these drugs have caused a recent
spike in overdose deaths, whereas deaths from prescription opioids
have stabilized. NSOs are used as stand-alone products, as adulter-
ants in heroin, or as constituents of counterfeit prescription medi-
cations. During 2015 alone, there were 9580 deaths from synthetic
opioids other than methadone. Most of these fatalities were associ-
ated with IMF rather than diverted pharmaceutical fentanyl. In
opioid overdose cases, where the presence of fentanyl analogs
was examined, analogs were implicated in 17% of fatalities. Recent
data from law enforcement sources show increasing confiscation of
acetylfentanyl, butyrylfentanyl, and furanylfentanyl, in addition to
non-fentanyl compounds such as U-47700. Since 2013, deaths from
NSOs in the United States were 52 for acetylfentanyl, 40 for
butyrylfentanyl, 128 for furanylfentanyl, and 46 for U-47700. All
of these substances induce a classic opioid toxidrome, which can be
reversed with the competitive antagonist naloxone. However, due to
the putative high potency of NSOs and their growing prevalence, it is
recommended to forgo the 0.4 mg initial dose of naloxone and start
with 2 mg. Because NSOs offer enormous profit potential, and there
is strong demand for their use, these drugs are being trafficked by
organized crime. NSOs present major challenges for medical pro-
fessionals, law enforcement agencies, and policymakers. Resources
must be distributed equitably to enhance harm reduction though
public education, medication-assisted therapies, and improved
access to naloxone.

N
ew psychoactive substances (NPS) are defined as ‘‘sub-
stances of abuse, either in pure form or a preparation,
that are not controlled by the 1961 Convention on Narcotic
Drugs or the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances,
but which may pose a public health threat (UNODC, 2013;
Madras, 2017).’’ In the context of this definition, the term
‘‘new’’ does not necessarily refer to new chemical entities, but
rather those compounds that have recently become available
in the recreational (ie, nonmedical) drug market. Many NPS
are created by modifying the chemical structures of illegal
drugs or prescribed medications to generate substances which
circumvent existing drug control laws. As governments pass
legislation to render specific NPS illegal, new replacement
analogs are synthesized and marketed to stay 1 step ahead of
regulators and law enforcement. In recent years, there has
been explosive growth in the market for NPS, fueled by
entrepreneurs and organized crime groups who have exploited
both the manufacturing capacity in Asian countries and the
emergence of globalized trade (Brandt et al., 2014).
Phenethylamines
and
piperazine
derivatives
were
present in the recreational drug market during the 1990s
and early 2000, but it was not until synthetic cannabinoids
(eg, ‘‘incense’’ or ‘‘spice’’) appeared around 2004 that misuse
of NPS became widespread (Vardakou et al., 2010; UNODC,
2013). The emergence of synthetic cannabinoids was fol-
lowed by the appearance of synthetic cathinones (eg, ‘‘bath
salts’’) in 2010 (Baumann et al., 2013). When the United
Nations (UN) Office on Drugs and Crime released its report
on NPS in 2013, synthetic cannabinoids and cathinones
accounted for the vast majority of new street drugs, and
the only opioids mentioned were O-desmethyltramadol and
kratom (UNODC, 2013). Since then, illicitly manufactured
fentanyl (IMF) and a number of novel synthetic opioids
(NSO) have appeared in the recreational drug market in the
United States and elsewhere. Fentanyl is a prescribed opioid
medication which is 50 to 100 times more potent than
morphine, but IMF is synthesized in Asian laboratories and
marketed via the Internet much like other NPS. Figure 1
depicts the chemical structures of fentanyl, morphine, and
some commonly encountered NSOs. For the purposes of this
review, the term NSO includes emerging analogs of fentanyl
and various non-fentanyl compounds. At present, IMF and

REVIEW
 NSO are causing an alarming spike in overdose deaths. This
increase in fatalities seems partially due to the fact that many
users are unknowingly consuming these compounds as adul-
terants in products sold as heroin, or as counterfeit pain killers
(Amlani et al., 2015; DEA, 2016b). It is estimated that a single
kilogram of NSO can be used to manufacture hundreds of
thousands of counterfeit prescription tablets, which can pro-
duce millions of dollars in revenue for traffickers (DEA,
2016b). The substances are usually imported through the
mail, but the small quantities of compounds being shipped
are difficult to detect and intercept when compared with
typical illicit drug freight. There is incredible financial incen-
tive for traffickers and counterfeiters to import and sell these
substances, so the trend is expected to continue or even
intensify.
This article will present a brief review of the epidemi-
ology of use, pharmacology and toxicology, clinical manage-
ment, forensic detection, and regulatory issues associated with
NSOs. Recent data from the National Forensic Laboratory
Information System (NFLIS) will also be presented. NFLIS
collects data pertaining to the psychoactive constituents of
drug products confiscated by local, state, and Federal law
enforcement agencies in the United States. This review is
intended to inform healthcare providers of this dangerous new
class of drugs, and serve as a starting point for basic scientists
and policymakers looking to explore this problem further.
EPIDEMIOLOGY OF USE
The widespread availability of NPS is a global phenom-
enon, but the prevalence of use remains enigmatic (UNODC,
2013). With regard to NSOs, information about the prevalence
of misuse is scarce, because the drug landscape is constantly
changing, the substances are not detected by standard toxi-
cology screens, and users are often unknowingly exposed to
the drugs. In the United States, trends in availability and use of
NPS can be inferred from information about confiscated drug
products such as the NFLIS database, and from overdose
death data provided by the Center for Disease Control (CDC).
Table 1 depicts the number of drug encounters for fentanyl
and selected NSOs as reported from 2011 to 2016 by NFLIS.

 Before 2015, fentanyl was the main synthetic opioid encoun-
tered by law enforcement, but more recently, fentanyl analogs
and non-fentanyl compounds have appeared.
In 2015, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)
and CDC both issued nationwide alerts identifying fentanyl,
particularly IMF, as a threat to public safety (Peterson et al.,
2016). In a study which examined synthetic opioid overdose
deaths in 27 states from 2013 to 2014, the number of con-
fiscated drug products containing fentanyl (ie, fentanyl sub-
missions) increased by 426%, whereas the number of deaths
due to synthetic opioids increased by 79% (Gladden et al.,
2016). Importantly, the increase in synthetic opioid deaths
was strongly correlated with the rise in fentanyl submissions
(r ¼ 0.95), but not correlated with fentanyl prescriptions
which remained stable (Gladden et al., 2016). Eight states
carry particularly high synthetic opioid death burdens includ-
ing 3 in the Northeast (Massachusetts, Maine, and New
Hampshire), 4 in the South (Florida, Kentucky, Maryland,
and North Carolina), and 1 in the Midwest (Ohio). The
increase in synthetic opioid deaths is disproportionately
affecting the same demographic associated with heroin use,
namely non-Hispanic white men aged 25 to 44 years. Drug
products containing fentanyl increased a further 160%
between 2014 and 2015 to 13,822, and deaths from synthetic
opioids other than methadone increased 72% to 9580 over that
same time interval (Rudd et al., 2016).
Whereas pharmaceutical fentanyl is diverted for abuse
in the United States at low levels, the recent rise in synthetic
opioid overdose deaths is largely due to IMF (DEA, 2016e). It
is estimated the true numbers of synthetic opioid-related
deaths could be much higher than noted above, because many
medical examiners and state crime laboratories do not test for
fentanyl or NSOs unless given a specific reason to do so. IMF
is often mixed with heroin and then sold as a heroin product in
the illicit market. Thus, the role of fentanyl adulterants in
purported heroin-overdose deaths could be underestimated.
More recently, a trend of counterfeit prescription pills con-
taining IMF or NSO has been observed (DEA, 2016b; Green
and Gilbert, 2016; Armenian et al., 2017). A single kilogram
of IMF or NSO can be used to produce hundreds of thousands
of counterfeit prescription pills, yielding tens of millions of
dollars for traffickers. In 1 recent study where the presence of
fentanyl analogs was examined in forensic cases, fentanyl
analogs were implicated in 17% of fentanyl-related deaths
between January and June 2015 (Peterson et al., 2016).
The DEA reports that the current fentanyl crisis is being
fueled by fentanyl and fentanyl precursor chemicals coming
from Asian laboratories, principally in China (DEA, 2016b).
Seizures of fentanyl, pills containing NSOs, and clandestine
pill press operations from across North America indicate that
the availability of NSOs is becoming a trend, rather than just
isolated incidents. The 2015 National Survey on Drug Use
and Health estimates 12.5 million Americans misused pain
relievers in the past year (SAMHSA, 2016). This high
demand, combined with the tremendous profit potential,
provides strong incentives for traffickers to produce counter-
feit pills to meet market needs. The DEA reports the pattern of
abuse of fentanyl analogs mirrors that of heroin and prescrip-
tion opioid analgesics misuse (DEA, 2016b).
PHARMACOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY
Morphine is the prototypical opioid receptor agonist,
and the standard to which all other opioid analgesics are
compared (Pasternak and Pan, 2013; Schumacher et al.,
2015). Opioid agents include not only the natural and semi-
synthetic alkaloid derivatives from opium, but also synthetic
surrogates and other opioid-like drugs whose actions are
blocked by the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. It is
well-established that opioid drugs can interact with 3 major
opioid receptor subtypes in the brain and spinal cord (ie, m, d,
and k subtypes), and receptor selectivity influences in vivo
drug actions (Law et al., 2000). The discovery of m-d opioid
heteroreceptors (Fujita et al., 2015) and m-opioid receptor
gene splice variants (Pasternak, 2014) adds tremendous com-
plexity to the endogenous opioid system. Nevertheless, sev-
eral lines of evidence, including studies with opioid receptor
knockout mice, confirm the major pharmacologic actions of
morphine such as euphoria, analgesia, respiratory depression,
and dependence are all due to agonist actions at the m-opioid
receptor (Williams et al., 2013; Charbogne et al., 2014).
Among the major classes of m-opioid receptor agonists,
4-anilidopiperidines (ie, fentanyl analogs) have a prominent
place in clinical usage because of their high potency, low
cardiovascular toxicity, rapid onset, and short duration of
action (Vuckovic
´ et al., 2009). These properties arise from
their high lipophilicity, which allows them to distribute
rapidly across the blood-brain barrier (Williams et al.,
2013). Fentanyl is the prototypic 4-anilidopiperidine, and a
large number of fentanyl analogs have been synthesized since
the 1960s (Vuckovic
´ et al., 2009). The same properties
which give fentanyl its therapeutic attributes can lead to
life-threatening adverse effects when the drug is consumed
illicitly, especially at high doses.
In this section, we review the pharmacology and toxi-
cology of specific NSOs including fentanyl analogs and non-
fentanyl m-opioid agonists that have entered the recreational
drug marketplace in recent years. A detailed discussion of
structure–activity relationships (SAR) is beyond the scope of
this review, but it should be noted that subtle alterations in
chemical structure can markedly affect drug potency, duration
of action, and receptor selectivity (Vardanyan and Hruby,
2014). It is also well-known that many opioid drugs exhibit
stereo-selectivity in their interactions at opioid-binding sites
(Law, 2011). Because none of the newly emerging NSOs has
been studied in controlled clinical settings, their pharmaco-
logical properties in humans can only be inferred from animal
experiments, or from studies of related compounds in man and
toxicological case reports. Most opioid analgesics are well-
absorbed when given by subcutaneous, intramuscular, and
oral routes (Schumacher et al., 2015). However, due to first-
pass metabolism, the effective oral dose may need to be much
higher than the parenteral dose. There is significant interin-
dividual variability in both first-pass and subsequent metab-
olism related to variety of factors including genetics and
history of drug or medication exposure.
For opioid drugs, the demonstration of pain relief (ie,
antinociception) in laboratory animals is usually indicative of
analgesic actions in man (Cox, 2011). With respect to the
NSOs discussed here, estimating effective drug doses in

 humans based on animal studies presents significant chal-
lenges because: various opioid drugs have been tested using
diverse antinociception assay methods that are not always
comparable; drugs have been administered via different routes
of administration or in different species across studies; there is
significant variability in antinociceptive dose–effect curves
even among different strains of the same species (Elmer et al.,
1998). Thus, extrapolation of data from rodents to man is not
straightforward. In Table 2, ED50 values for various NSOs in
mouse antinociception assays are compared with correspond-
ing values for morphine and fentanyl, where appropriate.
Keeping in mind the caveats noted above, these ratios could
be cautiously applied to estimate dosing in humans.
Acetylfentanyl
Acetylfentanyl
(IUPAC
name:
N-phenyl-N-[1-(2-
phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl]acetamide)
is
an
analog
also
known as des-methylfentanyl, since its chemical structure
is characterized by the removal of a single methyl group from
the N-propionyl of fentanyl. The synthesis of acetylfentanyl
was first described in 1964 by Janssen and Gardocki (Janssen
and Gardocki, 1964). In the mouse acetic acid writhing assay,
acetylfentanyl is approximately 1/3 the potency of fentanyl
and 16 times more potent than morphine. Importantly, the
drug has a narrow therapeutic index with LD50/ED50 ratios 23
times and 3 times less than fentanyl and morphine, respect-
ively (Higashikawa and Suzuki, 2008). The first submission of
acetylfentanyl to NFLIS was recorded in Maine in April 2013
(DEA, 2015). Concurrently, in March to May 2013, a series of
fatal intoxications in the region was reported (Lozier et al.,
2015). Since its initial appearance, the DEA reports at least 52
confirmed fatalities, and numerous acetylfentanyl overdose
cases are described in the forensic literature (DEA, 2015;
McIntyre et al., 2015; Poklis et al., 2015; Cunningham et al.,
2016). Clinical presentation of acetylfentanyl intoxication and
overdose is similar to that of other opioid analgesics, and the
drug was placed into temporary schedule I control in the
United States in May 2015.
Butyrylfentanyl
Butyrylfentanyl
(IUPAC
name:
N-phenyl-N-[1-(2-
phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl]butanamide), or butyrfentanyl, is
an analog with a methyl group added to the N-propionyl of
fentanyl. It was first mentioned in the scientific literature in
the late 1980s, where it was tested for opioid activity in variety
of assays (Woods et al., 1988). In the acetic acid writhing
assay, butyrylfentanyl displays 1/8 the potency of fentanyl and
is about 7 times more potent than morphine (Higashikawa and
Suzuki, 2008). The drug first appeared in the NFLIS database
in March 2014 when it was seized in Kansas (DEA, 2016f). To
date, the DEA confirmed at least 40 deaths related to butyr-
ylfentanyl, and several fatal cases with post mortem drug
concentrations have been described in the literature (McIntyre
et al., 2016; Poklis et al., 2016). Its clinical presentation is
similar to other fentanyls, and the drug was placed into
temporary schedule I control in the United States in
May 2016.
Furanylfentanyl
Furanylfentanyl
(IUPAC
name:
N-phenyl-N-[1-(2-
phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl]-2-furamide) is an analog charac-
terized by the presence of a furan ring on the carboxamide
moiety. The drug was initially described in 1986 patent
literature by scientists at the BOC group (Huang et al.,
1986). Based on the limited data available from mice,
furanylfentanyl
displays
an
antinociceptive
potency
of
0.02 mg/kg after i.v. administration; however, this potency
value is difficult to compare with other studies summarized in
Table 2, which employed different assay methods and routes
of drug administration. The first report of furanylfentanyl in
NFLIS was in January 2016 in Ohio; however, it was reported
in toxicological data as early as 2015 (DEA, 2016g). There
have been at least 128 confirmed fatalities associated with
furanylfentanyl according to the DEA. Mohr et al. (2016)
recently described a series of fatal furanylfentanyl cases, with
post mortem tissue concentrations. The drug was placed into
temporary schedule I status in November 2016.

 AH-7921
AH-7921 (IUPAC name: 3,4-dichloro-N-{[1(dimethyla-
mino)cyclohexyl]methyl} benzamide) was initially described
in 1974 by a drug discovery team from Allen & Hanburys Ltd,
and belongs to a series of compounds known as cyclohexyl-
amines (Harper et al., 1974; Harper and Veitch, 1976). The
drug exhibits similar potency to morphine in the mouse hot
plate and phenylquinone writhing assays (Brittain et al.,
1973). AH-7921 was first noted in NFLIS during 2013,
but has been encountered by American law enforcement only
a few times (Table 1). There has been 1 confirmed fatality
from AH-7921 in the United States, but a number of deaths
have been associated with the drug in Europe (Karinen et al.,
2014; Kronstrand et al., 2014). It should be noted that AH-
7921 is 1.7-fold more potent than morphine at inducing
respiratory depression in mice, suggesting greater risk for
adverse effects in man (Hayes and Tyers, 1983). The sub-
stance was placed into schedule I control in May 2016.
U-47700
U-47700 (IUPAC name: 3,4-dichloro-N-[(1R,2R)-2-
(dimethylamino)cyclohexyl]-N-methylbenzamide) was dev-
eloped by research scientists at the Upjohn Company in the
late 1970s (Szmuszkovicz, 1978). In the recreational drug
market, U-47700 is sometimes referred to as ‘‘pink,’’ because
impurities in its synthesis cause the drug powder to be slightly
pink in color. The drug is also known as ‘‘U4.’’ It is a structural
isomer of AH-7921 that contains 2 chiral centers, 1 at each of
its nitrogen atoms (Szmuszkovicz, 1999), and the trans-
racemic mixture is the form being sold online (Elliott
et al., 2016). U-47700 has much higher binding affinity for
the m-opioid receptor when compared with its affinity for the
d and k-opioid receptors (Loew et al., 1988). In the mouse tail
flick assay, U-47700 is about 1/10 as potent as fentanyl, but
7.5 times more potent than morphine (Cheney et al., 1985;
Narita et al., 2002). U-47700 was first reported to NFLIS in
October 2015. Since then, there has been an uptick in con-
fiscated products and at least 46 overdose deaths in the United
States (DEA, 2016h). The majority of deaths took place in
New York or North Carolina, and a number of overdose cases
are reported in the literature (Mohr et al., 2016; Ruan et al.,
2016; Jones et al., 2017). Online reports from users indicate
U-47700 induces significant euphoria, which is short-lived
and causes an urge to keep ‘‘re-dosing’’ (Elliott et al., 2016).
As of November 14, 2016, U-47700 is placed under temporary
schedule I status (DEA, 2016h).
MT-45
MT-45(IUPACname: 1-cyclohexyl-4-(1,2-diphenylethyl)-
piperazine) was developed in the 1970s as an analgesic agent
at the Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co. in Japan (Nishimura
et al., 1976). It is an N,N-di-substituted piperazine that was
part of a series of chemicals investigated as alternatives to
morphine for analgesia (Natsuka et al., 1987). MT-45 is a
chiral molecule with 1 asymmetric center. The S(þ) enan-
tiomer is responsible for most of the analgesic activity of the
racemic mixture (Nakamura and Shimizu, 1976), which is the
form most often seized by law enforcement (EMCDDA,
2014). In the mouse tail pinch assay, MT-45 is 3.5 times
more potent than morphine (Fujimura et al., 1978). It was first
reported in NFLIS during 2013, but there have been few
seizures of the drug and only isolated fatalities in the United
States (Papsun et al., 2016). By contrast, MT-45 has been
associated with many reports of fatal intoxications in Europe,
with Sweden reporting 28 analytically confirmed deaths
between November 2013 and July 2014 alone (EMCDDA,
2014; Siddiqi et al., 2015).
When compared with other NSOs, MT-45 displays
unique pharmacological properties including long-term oto-
toxicity and a deep level of unconsciousness (Helander et al.,
2014). It produces a low mitotic effect, which could lead
to misdiagnosis and compromised treatment (Coppola and
Mondola, 2014). MT-45 exhibits significant agonism at both d
and k-opioid receptors, which might explain its unique effects
(EMCDDA, 2014). Reports from online forums indicate a
slow onset of action, greater than 1 to 2 hours when taken
orally, which may increase the risk of toxic overdose from re-
dosing before peak effect is reached (Helander et al., 2014).
Taken intravenously, it is 11 times more lethal than morphine
on the basis of LD50 data in mice (EMCDDA, 2014). It is
currently unregulated in the United States.
INTOXICATION AND MANAGEMENT
Intoxication with all of the aforementioned NSOs is
characterized by a reduced level of consciousness, ranging
from drowsiness to stupor, which resembles that produced by
more classic opioid agents (Fareed et al., 2011). Under
conditions of overdose, NSOs induce an opioid toxidrome
associated with loss of consciousness, bradycardia, respirat-
ory depression, cyanosis, and miosis (Holstege and Borek,
2012; Zimmerman, 2014). Additional clinical features may
include hypotension, pulmonary edema, ileus, nausea, vomit-
ing, and pruritus. Death is usually from respiratory depres-
sion. Because many NSOs display chemical structures that are
closer to fentanyl rather than morphine, it is expected that
properties of these substances would be more akin to fentanyl
as well. Thus, one would predict low oral bioavailability, high
potency, and short duration of action, especially with the
fentanyl analogs (MacKenzie et al., 2016). All routes of
administration including oral, sublingual, nasal insufflation,
nasal spray, inhalation via burning powder on aluminum foil,
inhalation via a ‘‘vaporizer,’’ and rectal and intravenous
injection have been reported (Helander et al., 2014; WHO,
2015; Papsun et al., 2016; WHO, 2016). Diagnosis of opioid
overdose is made by characteristic clinical findings, exposure
history, qualitative urine toxicology assay, and response to
naloxone (Zimmerman, 2014). Immediate priorities in opioid
toxicity are support of ventilation, correction of hypotension,
and reversal of toxic effects with an opioid antagonist. If
reversal of respiratory depression cannot be accomplished
quickly, intubation may be required.
Naloxone is a competitive m-opioid receptor antagonist,
which serves as an effective antidote for opioid overdose.
The recommended initial dose of naloxone is 0.4 to 2 mg
(Zimmerman, 2014; Kim and Nelson, 2015). However, it is
known that doses of 10 to 20 mg may be required to reverse
the effects of potent synthetic opioids. Emergency department
data from a fentanyl outbreak in Chicago during 2005 to 2006

 revealed that the standard 0.4 mg naloxone dose was only
successful in reversing 15% of cases, and the mean naloxone
dose required for rescue was 3.36 mg (Schumann et al., 2008).
Despite initial naloxone doses exceeding 2 mg, no withdrawal
symptoms or other adverse effects were noted in this study.
Given these data and the increasing prevalence of IMF and
NSO, it seems logical to increase the standard initial naloxone
dose from 0.4 to 2 mg. Currently, there are 2 forms of
naloxone available for emergency use in community set-
tings—an intramuscular autoinjector manufactured by Kale
´o
Pharma and a 4 mg nasal spray manufactured by Adapt
Pharma (Traynor, 2016b). Kale
´o received US FDA approval
on October 19, 2016, to begin manufacturing a 2 mg auto-
injector, and this has recently replaced its 0.4 mg formulation
(Traynor, 2016a). Concerns have been raised regarding the
efficacy of intranasal naloxone in reversing overdose from
synthetic opioids (Zuckerman et al., 2014). However, the basis
for such concerns involved a 2 mg dosage, and the current
formulation for intranasal delivery is 4 mg. A randomized
controlled trial comparing intranasal and intramuscular nalox-
one of the same dosage for suspected heroin overdose con-
cluded similar efficacy, and both routes could be used as first-
line treatment (Kerr et al., 2009).
FORENSIC DETECTION
The detection of NSOs presents challenges for clinical
toxicologists and forensic scientists. When new substances
first appear in the recreational drug marketplace, they must be
identified and quantified in confiscated drug products, and in
biological specimens from patients exposed to the drugs
(Smith et al., 2015). Standard urine toxicology screens use
antibody-based methods, such as enzyme-mediated immuno-
assays, to detect misuse of heroin (Tenore, 2010; Rogers et al.,
2016). Such methods recognize morphine, its metabolites, and
related semisynthetic analogs, but do not detect structurally
distinct opioids such as fentanyl. On the contrary, fentanyl can
be detected using a separate enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) (eg, Ruangyuttikarn et al., 1990), but dis-
tinguishing fentanyl from its various structural analogs
requires more sophisticated analytical methods such as gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Because of
the cross-reactivity between fentanyl and its analogs in ELISA
tests, the presence of fentanyl analogs often goes unnoticed
(Stogner, 2014). Numerous case reports describe opioid over-
dose patients who displayed positive ELISA results for fen-
tanyl, but did not have fentanyl present when specimens were
assayed by GC-MS (McIntyre et al., 2015; Fort et al., 2016;
McIntyre et al., 2016). Acetylfentanyl, butyrylfentanyl, and
possibly other analogs cross-react with fentanyl ELISA, so the
presence of these fentanyl-related NSOs requires additional
analytical confirmation.
To date, no antibody-based methods are commercially
available to detect non-fentanyl analogs such as AH-7921,
U-47700, or MT-45. Given the rapid increase in number and
variety of NSOs, the cumbersome process of developing
immunoassays probably cannot keep pace with the appear-
ance of new substances. The lack of specificity for immuno-
assays can be problematic as well. In 1 case report, U-47700
caused a false-positive for the presence of benzodiazepines
using immunoassay methods (Schneir et al., 2017). Con-
sequently, alternative analytical methods such as GC-MS,
liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS), high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), Fourier trans-
form infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), or nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectrometry are required to definitively
verify the presence of many NSOs (UNODC, 2013; Elliott
et al., 2016; Mohr et al., 2016; Papsun et al., 2016). Since
analytical methods like GC-MS and LC-MS are not routinely
available in many clinical settings, the true prevalence of use
for NSOs is difficult to ascertain and most likely under-
reported. Even when sophisticated instrumentation is avail-
able, forensic specialists face serious impediments to method
development and validation, because there is a time lag
between drug identification and availability of reference
material from commercial suppliers (Brandt et al., 2014).
LEGAL AND REGULATORY ISSUES
The rapid emergence of NPS, combined with the inter-
net as an efficient mechanism for global marketing and sales,
is creating a challenge for regulators (Seddon, 2014). As
mentioned previously, the current IMF and NSO crisis is
being fueled by drug and precursor supplies coming from
Asian laboratories, especially those located in China (DEA,
2016b). China is actively collaborating with US partners like
the DEA, but addressing the issue of NSO is complicated by
the high potency of the substances, which engenders small
masses to intercept and the use of freight forwarding by
traffickers. The problem of NPS has led to a call for action
by 2 general strategies. The first strategy aims to find faster
and more efficient mechanisms for banning those NPS that are
dangerous enough to merit prohibition, whereas the second
seeks to leverage the NPS problem to revisit the possibility for
creating alternatives to criminalization, and rekindling old
debates about drug policy reform. The former topic will be
reviewed briefly below; regarding the latter topic, the reader
may refer to the 2014 London School of Economics review
entitled ‘‘Ending the Drug Wars’’ for a detailed examination
of this stance (Collins, 2014).
Three UN treaties, the oldest from 1961, seek to
‘‘advance the health and welfare of mankind’’ by prohibiting
the nonmedical use of certain drugs (Godlee and Hurley,
2016). If the UN decides to schedule a substance, each
Member State must regulate that substance with at least as
much stringency (Coulson and Caulkins, 2012). Many gov-
ernments, including those of China, Russia, Sweden, and the
United States, are strongly in favor of tougher law enforce-
ment (Farrell, 2014). In 2016, there was an unprecedented
degree of collaboration between the US DEA and the Chinese
counterpart—the Narcotics Control Bureau, part of the Min-
istry of Public Security. In personal communications with
Russell Baer of the DEA’s National Media Affairs, it was
relayed that China is collaborating with the United States to
stem the flow of fentanyl and its analogs. He reports that this
collaboration reaches to the highest levels of international
government, with the topic being discussed by President
Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping during the Septem-
ber 2016 G20 summit in Hangzhou. Within the United States,
the DEA is expanding its 360 Strategy which leverages

 partnerships at federal, state, and local levels on 3 different
fronts: law enforcement, diversion control, and demand
reduction (DEA, 2016c).
With regard to US government expenditures for drug
policy, it should be noted that two-thirds of expenditures are
currently spent on law enforcement and supply reduction
(Farrell, 2014). Recently, there has been a call for a more
equitable distribution of resources to fund prevention, treat-
ment, and harm reduction. Multiple strategies, including
targeted education interventions for primary prevention,
greater access to medication-assisted therapies, and increased
availability of naloxone to prevent overdose deaths, are
currently being explored (Hawk et al., 2015; Wolfe et al.,
2016).
OTHER EMERGING THREATS
Carfentanil (IUPAC name: 4-[{1-oxopropyl}-phenyl-
amino]-1-[2-phenylethyl]-4-piperidinecarboxylic acid methyl
ester) is a fentanyl analog which was first synthesized by
Janssen in 1974, and introduced as a veterinary anesthetic for
large animals in 1986 (Stanley et al., 2008). It is reportedly
10,000 times more potent than morphine, and 100 times
stronger than fentanyl. On September 22, 2016, the DEA issued
a warning to police and the public about carfentanil being
present in the recreational drug markets in multiple commun-
ities, often disguised as heroin (DEA, 2016a). Whereas the
lethal dose of carfentanil in humans is not known, relative
potency estimates suggest that 20mg of carfentanil could cause
death. The chief medical examiner in Broward County, FL,
reported on November 3, 2016, that carfentanil was the sus-
pected culprit in at least 53 overdose deaths during the year.
Carfentanil was also reported as an adulterant in the heroin
supply in several regions of Ohio (Samet, 2016). In Canada,
carfentanil has been linked to 15 deaths in Alberta, and the drug
was found in blotter form in Manitoba (CBC News, 2016;
Ziegler and Laville, 2016). For the purposes of the present
review, we decided not to include carfentanil along with other
NSOs, because the drug is not novel, being used in veterinary
medicine since 1986. Nevertheless, the reported misuse of
carfentanil as an adulterant in heroin, and the possibility of
its presence in other drug products or counterfeit pills, presents
a serious public health threat.
W-18 (IUPAC name: 4-chloro-N-[{2Z}-1-[2-{4-nitro-
phenyl}ethyl]piperidin-2-ylidene]benzene-1-sulfonamide)
was developed in 1981 at the University of Alberta and is part
of a class of compounds referred to as the W-series (Knaus
et al., 1984). Despite data from the 1984 patent showing
analgesic potency 10,000 times greater than morphine, recent
studies reveal no activity for W-18 or any of its metabolites at
opioid receptors, or any other target of psychoactive drugs
(Knaus et al., 1984; Huang et al., 2016; Kroll, 2016). How-
ever, W-18 is still considered an emerging threat as it has been
seized by traffickers in Florida and Alberta (CCENDU, 2016).
W-18 is schedule I in Canada as of June 1, 2016, and in
personal communication with Russell Baer of the DEA, the
United States is considering temporary scheduling of W-18.
Finally, starting in the second quarter of 2016, valer-
ylfentanyl (IUPAC name: N-phenyl-N-[1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-
piperidinyl]pentanamide) has been reported in NFLIS seizure
data (DEA, 2016d). At present, there are no data available on
possible fatalities associated with valerylfentanyl, or descrip-
tions of pharmacological effects in humans or animals.
Extrapolating from known SAR for fentanyl compounds,
which show analgesic potency decreases with increasing
length of carboxamide substituents, it can be inferred that
valerylfentanyl would be less potent than butyrylfentanyl
(Vuckovic
´ et al., 2009).
CONCLUSIONS
Novel synthetic opioids have been responsible for
hundreds of analytically confirmed deaths in the past 2 years,
and this number is likely an underestimate. If deaths from IMF
are included, the total number of fatalities over the 2-year
period exceeds 15,000. As deaths from natural and semi-
synthetic opiates are stabilizing, deaths from synthetic opioids
are rising at an alarming rate (Rudd et al., 2016). This scourge
of opioid-related fatalities affects a demographic that is
traditionally associated with use of heroin and other illicit
opioids, but also impacts those who misuse prescription pain
medications. The latter demographic is now being targeted by
unscrupulous counterfeiters who are creating pain medi-
cations containing IMF and NSO. Many of the drugs dis-
cussed here are several times more potent than morphine,
approaching the strength of fentanyl. Based on the increasing
prevalence of synthetic opioids of unknown origin and
potency, we recommend foregoing the 0.4 mg naloxone dose
in cases of suspected opioid overdose and proceeding directly
to 2 mg. Some NSOs, such as MT-45, have unique clinical
features—bilateral hearing loss and low miotic effect,
whereas others such as U-47700 are short-acting and lead
to a strong urge for re-dosing. No controlled clinical studies
have been carried out to examine the pharmacology of NSOs,
and few animal studies have examined the biological effects
of NSOs using in vitro receptor assays or in vivo paradigms.
Clearly, more basic research on the pharmacology and toxi-
cology of these compounds is warranted.
The true prevalence of NSO misuse is difficult to
determine. In most cases of opioid overdose, naloxone is
administered to ameliorate symptoms, and confirmatory ana-
lytical testing is not performed. When the presence of fentanyl
analogs was examined in overdose death cases, analogs were
implicated as the cause of death in 17% of cases that were
initially thought to be due to fentanyl (Peterson et al., 2016).
Thus, there should be increased efforts by clinical toxicolo-
gists and forensic scientists to detect the presence of NSOs in
heroin and fentanyl-related intoxications and deaths, to deter-
mine the precise role of novel substances in the growing
overdose epidemic (Mohr et al., 2016). Like other NPS,
synthetic opioids present extraordinary challenges for regu-
lators and law enforcement. In recent times, most of the NSOs
mentioned in this review were placed into schedule I control
as a means to reduce demand. We suggest that expenditures on
regulation and law enforcement be balanced by efforts to
decrease demand though education, medication-assisted treat-
ment, and easier access to naloxone (Farrell, 2014; Hawk
et al., 2015; Wolfe et al., 2016). Overall, IMF and NSO
represent a significant threat to public health. As great prog-
ress has been made in stabilizing deaths from prescription

 opioids, much work is now needed to address the rise in deaths
caused by illicitly manufactured synthetic opioids.
