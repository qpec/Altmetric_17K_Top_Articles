Background: This study aims to determine the role of patient expectations as potentially modifiable factor of side-
effects, quality of life, and adherence to endocrine treatment of breast cancer.
Patients and methods: A 2-year prospective clinical cohort study was conducted in routine primary care with post-
operative patients with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer, scheduled to start adjuvant endocrine treatment.
Structured patient-reported assessments of side-effects, side-effect expectations, quality of life, and adherence took
place during the first week post-surgery and after 3 and 24 months of endocrine treatment.
Results: Of 111 enrolled patients, at 3 and 24 months, 107 and 88 patients, respectively, were assessed. After 2 years
of endocrine treatment, patients reported high rates of side-effects (arthralgia: 71.3%, weight gain: 53.4%, hot flashes:
46.5%), including symptoms not directly attributable to the medication (breathing problems: 28.1%, dizziness: 25.6%).
Pre-treatment expectations significantly predicted patient-reported long-term side-effects and quality of life in multivariate
models controlling for relevant medical and psychological variables. Relative risk of side-effects after 2 years of endocrine
treatment was higher in patients with high negative expectations at baseline than in those with low negative expectations
(RR = 1.833, CI 95%, 1.032–3.256). A significant interaction confirmed this expectation effect to be particularly evident in
patients with high side-effects at 3 months. Furthermore, baseline expectations were associated with adherence at 24
months (r = −0.25, P = 0.006).
Conclusions: Expectations are a genuine factor of clinical outcome from endocrine treatment for breast cancer.
Negative expectations increase the risk of treatment-specific side-effects, nocebo side-effects, and non-adherence. Yet,
controlled studies are needed to analyze potential causal relationships. Optimizing individual expectations might be a
promising strategy to improve side-effect burden, quality of life, and adherence during longer-term drug intake.

introduction
Drug-related side-effects are a major public health concern.
They frequently cause unfavorable health and treatment out-
comes, including pre-mature drug termination [1]. Current re-
search suggests that adverse side-effects are in part caused by
non-pharmacological factors such as negative expectations [2].
The nocebo effect, which refers to the side-effects reported by
people taking placebo, exemplifies psychological influences on
treatment tolerability [3, 4]. Research on the nocebo effect
showed that side-effects can also occur to a comparable degree
in the placebo group of a trial [5]. Moreover, drug-specific side-
effects have been documented in placebo groups of double-blind
randomized trials [6]. Verbal suggestion and negative treatment
information such as disclosure of side-effects can induce adverse
side-effects in people not taking placebo but active medication,
thereby eliciting nocebo-related responses during active drug
treatments [7, 8].
Adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) is the standard of care
for hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer, associated with
improved disease-free survival and time to recurrence [9].
While the optimal duration of endocrine therapies, alone or se-
quential, remains an area of active investigation, latest evidence
demonstrated incremental benefits of 10 years of tamoxifen

 compared with a 5-year regimen [10]. However, non-adherence
during the 5-year intake period ranges from 22% to 55% [11,
12]. Adverse side-effects that negatively affect quality of life con-
stitute the main reason for non-adherence. Thus, research into
potentially modifiable determinants of side-effects such as
patient expectations seems promising to promote quality of life
and adherence in breast cancer survivors undergoing AET.
Individual expectations of side-effects have been associated
with cancer treatment side-effects [13], specifically with the
non-specific toxic effects of chemotherapy such as nausea, pain,
and fatigue [14]. However, implications are restricted because
only few studies controlled for a prior history of symptoms or
examined long-term effects. Further limitations include homo-
geneity of samples from randomized trials, a lack of real-world
studies, and underreporting of non-serious side-effects, especial-
ly regarding patient-reported outcomes [15]. Until now, no
study has analyzed the influence of expectations on side-effects
of AET. This is particularly surprising since AET is the most fre-
quently prescribed oral anti-cancer agent worldwide [16].
This study aims to quantify the impact of side-effect expecta-
tions on actual side-effects, quality of life, and adherence within a
naturalistic 2-year prospective cohort study of AET for breast
cancer. Patient-reported side-effects are assessed adopting the
recommended terminology for reporting and grading drug
adverse effects [17, 18] controlling for relevant factors such as
baseline symptoms. A deeper understanding of patients’ expecta-
tions about the side-effects of AET might lead to new strategies to
ameliorate side-effects and promote adherence, ultimately redu-
cing morbidity and mortality for breast cancer survivors.
materials and methods
subjects
Eligible patients were identified by the hospitals’ patient-registry and
tumor board review. Inclusion criteria were: diagnosis of primary breast
cancer, estrogen-hormone-receptor-positive, surgery for breast cancer, rec-
ommendation for AET, female, 18–80 years, literate, no comorbid severe
mental disorders (addiction or schizophrenia), or life-threatening physical
impairments.
study design
Consecutive recruitment took place during routine primary care at a
University Breast Cancer Center from January 2011 to March 2012; follow-
ups were collected from May 2011 to May 2014. Eligibility was assessed
within 7 days following breast surgery. Consented patients received standar-
dized verbal and written information on mechanisms, benefits, and potential
side-effects of AET before treatment start. An information leaflet depicting
explicit benefit and risk information, including natural frequencies of the 18
most common and most serious side-effects of AET, was handed out and
discussed [19]. Treatment information was conducted face to face by trained
professionals using a script. One-time sessions lasted ∼15 min. They were
aimed at homogenizing pre-treatment information to avoid uncontrolled
influences on side-effect expectations and were conducted in an encouraging
manner. The primary investigator (YN) did trainings and supervision with
audio records. Assessments took place at the hospital before start of AET
and 3 and 24 months after start of AET via mailed questionnaires. Drop-
outs were contacted to assess adherence status. Ethical approval was given by
the ethics committee for medical research of the University of Marburg.
assessment
Side-effects and baseline symptoms were assessed using the modified General
Assessment of Side-effects Scale (GASE) [17]. Patients rated the severity of
44 symptoms during the last week on a Likert scale (0, not present; 1, mild;
2, moderate; 3, severe), including 21 AET-specific [9, 20], and 23 non-
specific symptoms, not directly attributable to the pharmacologic action of
AET. Cronbach’s α ranged between α = 0.87 and α = 0.91.
Side-effect expectations were measured with a modified GASE, assessing
expected intensities for each potential side-effect on visual analog scales
(length = 50 mm), from ‘not at all’ to ‘maximum intensity’. Overall expect-
ation was measured on a Likert scale (0, not expected; 1, expected side-
effects mild intensity; 2, moderate; 3, severe). Cronbach’s α was α = 0.96.
Health-related
Quality of
Life
(HrQoL)
was
measured
with
the
Questionnaire of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of
Cancer (EORTC/QLQ-C30). A total score for all 30 items was calculated
and transformed linearly to a range from 0 to 100, with high values indicat-
ing better HrQoL [21]. Cronbach’s α ranged from α = 0.93 to α = 0.95.
Adherence was measured with a pre-validated patient self-report score
[12].
Anxiety and depression were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety
and Depression Scale. Cronbach’s α was α = 0.82 (anxiety) and α = 0.86
(depression).
sociodemographic and medical characteristics.
Age, weight, height,
education, marital, and employment status were obtained in semi-structured
interviews. Stage of cancer (UICC), menopausal status, primary, and
adjuvant treatments were collected from medical charts. Comorbid chronic
medical illnesses during the last year were assessed with the revised
Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry and verified with
medical charts.
Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 20.0. No item had a rate of
missing values higher than 1.9%. Missings were distributed completely at
random (Little’s MCAR test P > 0.05) and imputed with multiple imputa-
tions using NORM 2.03. Hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses
were computed with a priori hypothesized sociodemographic and medical
variables, baseline symptoms, and psychological parameters entered within
the first three steps, and baseline side-effect expectations within the fourth
step. Power calculations for the specific increase in R2 in a multiple regres-
sion with 9 predictors resulted in 103 patients, given moderate effects,
α = 0.05, and ß = 0.80. To test the interaction of expectations and side-effects
over time, an ANCOVA of side-effects at 24 months was calculated using
baseline expectations and side-effects at 3 months as fixed factors.
Expectations and side-effects were dichotomized by categorizing none or
mild versus moderate or severe intensities. Relative risks, relative risk reduc-
tion, and numbers-needed-to-treat were calculated from crosstabs.
results
participants
Of 270 patients screened, 191 met inclusion criteria. A total of
n = 111 signed informed consent and were enrolled (Figure 1).
Three and 24 months after start of AET, n = 107 and n = 88
patients were assessed, with respective attrition rates of 3.6%
and 17.8%. Reasons for drop-out were exhaustion (n = 8), un-
availability (n = 7), stop of AET (n = 3), medical reasons (n = 3),
and death (n = 2). Comparisons of drop-outs and completers
revealed no significant differences in sociodemographic or clin-
ical characteristics. Baseline characteristics of the analyzed
sample (n = 111) are given in Table 1.

 expectations of side-effects
At baseline, nine patients (8.1%) reported to expect no side-
effects from AET. Mild side-effects were expected by 70 patients
(63.1%); 32 patients (28.8%) expected moderate to severe side-
effects. Drop-out was significantly higher in patients with mod-
erate or severe side-effect expectations than in patients reporting
none or mild expectations [χ2(1,111) = 3.034, P < 0.05]. The
overall intensity of expected side-effects was rated mild to mod-
erate (range = 0–3, M = 1.23, SD = 0.6).
side-effects and HrQoL at follow-up
Baseline-controlled event rates for side-effects at 24 months were
highest for arthralgia (71.3%), weight gain (53.4%), and myalgia
(50.6%). Notably, a number of non-specific symptoms such as
back pain (31%), breathing problems (24.7%), and palpitations
(20.7%) were reported (Figure 2). Supplementary Table S1, avail-
able at Annals of Oncology online, depicts rates for all time-points.
The mean number of moderate or severe symptoms increased
significantly from baseline (M = 3.55, SD = 3.96) to 3 months
[M = 6.07, SD = 6.10, t3 months(106) = −5.292, P < 0.01] and to
24 months [M = 6.81, SD = 7.28, t24 months(87) = −3.277, P < 0.01).
At 3 months, patients who dropped out later on (n = 19)
reported significantly more side-effects than completers (n = 88)
[t(105) = 3.398, P < 0.001]. Serious adverse events were recorded
for seven patients (cardiopulmonary syndromes, bleeding pro-
blems). HrQoL increased from baseline (M = 69.91, SD = 18.59)
to 3 months [M = 74.31, SD = 20.70, t(106) = −2.532, P < 0.05]
and remained stable until 24 months (M = 78.33, SD = 20.03).
adherence to AET
At 24 months, 68 women (61.3%) reported full adherence.
Eighty percent adherence was reported by 11 patients (9.9%).
Seventeen patients (15.3%) reported non-adherence, of these, 15
had discontinued completely. Owing to patient drop-out and
unavailability, adherence-status remained unknown in 13
patients (11.7%). Two patients were deceased (1.8%).

 correlates of side-effects and expectations (only
significant correlations of r ≥ 0.3 are reported)
Side-effects at 3 months were significantly correlated with base-
line side-effect expectations [r = 0.336 (107), P < 0.001], anxiety
[r = 0.477 (107), P < 0.001], and depression [r = 0.464 (107),
P < 0.001]. Side-effects at 24 months were correlated with base-
line expectations [r = 0.340 (88), P = 0.001]. No associations
with other clinical variables such as staging, type of AET, or ad-
juvant chemotherapy resulted.
Adherence at 24 months was correlated with side-effects at
3 months [r = −0.407 (93), P < 0.001], and small but significantly
with baseline side-effect expectations [r = −0.254 (96), P = 0.006].
prediction models of side-effects and HrQoL
Significant regression models resulted for baseline expectations on
long-term side-effects (Table 2). Patients’ age, menopausal status,
cancer stage, type of AET, depression, and anxiety did not con-
tribute significantly, comorbid conditions were significant pre-
dictor at 3 months. Baseline symptoms resulted as significant
predictor at 3 and 24 months. Patients’ baseline expectations pre-
dicted significant incremental variance components at 3 months
(ΔR² = 0.03, P = 0.023) and 24 months (ΔR² = 0.06, P = 0.018).
Higher expectations predicted a higher occurrence of side-effects
(β3 months = 0.19, P = 0.023; β24 months = 0.26, P = 0.018). The
final models explained 40% [F3 months(9,97) = 8.856, P < 0.001]
and 17% of variance [F24 months (9,78) = 2.905, P = 0.006].
The same analysis plan was used to predict HrQoL, with base-
line HrQoL as control variable. Age, menopausal status, staging,
comorbid conditions, anxiety, and depression did not contribute
significantly. Baseline EORTC scores resulted as significant
predictors in both models. Side-effect expectations explained
an additional 4% of HrQoL at 3 months. At 24 months, a
trend emerged. Higher expectations of side-effects predicted
lower HrQoL (β3 months = −0.22, P = 0.007; β24 months = −0.19,
P = 0.101). The final models explained 42% [F3 months(9,97) =
9.579, P < 0.001] and 19% of variance [F24 months(9,77) = 3.224,
P = 0.002].
relative risk of side-effects
Side-effects at 24 months were significantly higher in patients
with highly negative expectations at baseline (M = 10.64, SE = 1.25)
than in those with low negative expectations (M = 6.62, SE = 0.375).
An ANCOVA revealed this difference to be significant after con-
trolling for baseline symptoms and anxiety [F(1,82) = 7.565;
ηp
2 = 0.08] (Figure 3). Side-effects at 24 months were significantly
higher in patients with high side-effects at 3 months (M = 12.85,
SE = 1.15) than in patients with low initial side-effects [M = 4.41,
SE = 0.93; F(1,82) = 31.245; ηp
2 = 0.28]. Furthermore, there was a
significant interaction of expectations and 3 months side-effects
[F(1,82) = 5.507; ηp
2 = 0.06].
Crosstab analysis resulted in significant relative risks of side-
effects at 3 months (RR = 1.672, CI 95% 1.073–2.605) and 24
months (RR = 1.833, CI 95% 1.032–3.256) corresponding to
moderate to large relative risk reductions (RRR3 months = 0.40;
RRR24 months = 0.45) and a number-needed-to-treat of 4.4.
discussion
This was a prospective cohort study with high external validity
and a 2-year follow-up. Results confirmed that the incidence of
side-effects over 2 years of AET was prospectively influenced by
patients’ side-effect expectations as opposed to medical factors.

 Nocebo-related effects accounted for a risk reduction of 45%. In
other words, women holding negative or highly negative expec-
tations about the side-effects of AET before treatment start
experienced almost twice the side-effects than those with posi-
tive or low negative expectations. This expectation effect
increased over time and was particularly evident in patients
reporting high rates of side-effects after the first 3 months.
Furthermore, expectations about side-effects of AET predicted
HrQoL and were associated with adherence, although only with
a small effect. This finding is of high clinical relevance since
non-adherence to AET predicts lower survival [22].
Event rates for arthralgia, menopausal, and gynecologic
symptoms from this study were higher than those documented
in randomized, controlled trials of AET [20, 23]. Yet, compar-
able or even higher rates for gynecologic symptoms and sexual
dysfunction were reported from other real-life studies using pre-
specified patient-reported outcomes [24, 25]. Interestingly, the
women in this study reported considerable rates of non-specific

 side-effects such as breathing problems, palpitations, and rash.
This substantiates the conclusion that psychological mechan-
isms like expectation-related nocebo effects play a significant
role in AET for breast cancer survivors. Negative expectations,
formed by patients before the start of AET, seem to have a pro-
nounced influence on patient-reported long-term tolerability,
once they are confirmed by initially high side-effects. Whereas
negative baseline expectations that are violated by contrasting
experiences of low side-effects after the first 3 months of AET
seem to cease their negative impact. Hence, expectation-modifi-
cation interventions might be especially promising for patients
with negative expectations who initially report high side-effects.
Expectations as iatrogenic factors can be modified by psycho-
logical interventions [2, 5]. Therapeutic strategies aimed at redu-
cing nocebo-related side-effects might include psychoeducation
using beneficial information framing methods [26], optimizing
coping expectations, and symptom reattribution such as encour-
aging patients to view potential side-effects not as purely bother-
some complaints but as a signal that the therapy starts to exert
its beneficial effect [27, 28].
With regard to limitations, this naturalistic cohort did not
include a control group. Although confounding factors like
symptoms introduced by medical comorbidities, concurrent
treatments, age, or cancer staging were controlled statistically,
future studies might strengthen causal implications by experi-
mentally inducing expectations about cancer treatments. The
standardized AET-information was used to harmonize patients’
informational status. However, we were unable to control add-
itional sources like the Internet, friends, and families who might
have provided information about AET and shaped expectations.
The AET-information might have fostered adherence [19],
thereby restricting generalizability to other samples. Furthermore,
generalizability might be limited by the fact that nearly 40% of
eligible patients declined participation. Specifically, patients with
dysfunctional expectations about AET or low adherence might
have declined participation, since they were more likely to drop
out of the study. Thus, in an unselected sample, side-effect expec-
tations might result more negative and adherence rates lower
than reported here. Lastly, the relationship of expectations and
adherence warrants replication.
This study showed that a significant proportion of reported
side-effects from AET is determined by patients’ expectations

Figure 3. Reported side-effects after 24 months of AET of patients with
high and low expectations and high and low initial side-effects at 3 months.
Side-effects at 24 months = mean number of moderate or severe side-effects
after 24 months of endocrine treatment. Main effect expectation: side-effects
of endocrine treatment at 24 months are significantly higher in patients with
highly negative expectations at baseline, than in patients with low negative
expectations [F(1,83) = 7.797; ηp
2 = 0.09]. Main effects initial side-effects:
side-effects of endocrine treatment at 24 months are significantly higher in
patients with high initial side-effects (3 months response), than in patients
with low initial side-effects [F(1,83) = 39.096; ηp
2 = 0.32]. Interaction: side-
effects are higher in patients with negative expectations and initially high
side-effects [F(1,83) = 7.385; ηp
2 = 0.08]. Baseline symptoms and anxiety were
used as covariates. **P < 0.01.

 and therefore attributable to non-pharmacological mechanisms
like the nocebo effect. This raises the question how expectations
are formed and whether they can be remediated. Future studies
should target expectations and explore their longitudinal rela-
tionship to side-effects and adherence, possibly including non-
self-report measures. Furthermore, research is needed to quan-
tify the effects of treatment information on cancer patients’
expectations, and to evaluate how best to communicate possible
side-effects in order to prevent nocebo-related symptoms [29].
