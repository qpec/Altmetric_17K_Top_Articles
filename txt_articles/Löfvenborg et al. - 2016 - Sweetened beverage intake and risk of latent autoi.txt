Abstract
Objective: Sweetened beverage intake is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes, but its association with 
autoimmune diabetes is unclear. We aimed to investigate sweetened beverage intake and risk of latent autoimmune 
diabetes in adults (LADA); autoimmune diabetes with features of type 2 diabetes.
Design/methods: Data from a Swedish population-based study was used, including incident cases of LADA (n = 357) 
and type 2 diabetes (n = 1136) and randomly selected controls (n = 1371). Diabetes classification was based on 
onset age (≥35), glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GADA) and C-peptide. Sweetened beverage intake 
information was derived from a validated food frequency questionnaire. ORs adjusted for age, sex, family history of 
diabetes, education, lifestyle, diet, energy intake and BMI were estimated using logistic regression.
Results: Daily intake of >2 servings of sweetened beverages (consumed by 6% of participants) was associated  
with increased risk of LADA (OR: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.11–3.56), and for each 200 mL daily serving, OR was 1.15 (95% 
CI: 1.02–1.29). Findings were similar for sugar-sweetened (OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.00–1.39) and artificially sweetened 
beverages (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 0.95–1.32). Similarly, each daily serving increment in total sweetened beverage 
conferred 20% higher type 2 diabetes risk (95% CI: 1.07–1.34). In type 2 diabetes patients, high consumers displayed 
higher HOMA-IR levels (4.5 vs 3.5, P = 0.0002), but lower HOMA-B levels (55 vs 70, P = 0.0378) than non-consumers. 
Similar tendencies were seen in LADA.
Conclusions: High intake of sweetened beverages was associated with increased risk of LADA. The observed 
relationship resembled that with type 2 diabetes, suggesting common pathways possibly involving insulin resistance.
Introduction
Sugar-sweetened beverage intake has been linked to 
increased risk of type 2 diabetes in numerous studies 
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6); the most recent meta-analysis found 
that the risk increases by 13% for an increment of each 
serving per day in intake (7). Suggested routes by which 
sugar-sweetened beverages may influence diabetes risk 
are through glycemic or insulinemic responses or by 
contributing to excessive energy intake (8, 9). Artificially 
sweetened beverages have also been associated with an 
increased risk of type 2 diabetes (1, 10), although they 
contain no calories and are thus adding neither to the 
glycemic load nor to the total daily energy intake (11). 
Suggested mechanisms related to artificially sweetened 
beverages include enhanced appetite by distortion of

satiety signaling (11) and deteriorated glucose tolerance 
provoked by alterations in gut microbiota (12).
The association between sweetened beverages and 
autoimmune diabetes is less clear (13, 14), but a recent 
study suggests that intake of sugar-sweetened beverage 
may increase the risk of type 1 diabetes in genetically 
susceptible 
individuals 
(13). 
Possible 
mechanistic 
pathways for its involvement in autoimmune processes 
include induced beta cell apoptosis (15), which could be 
due to toxic levels of glucose (16), induced oxidative stress 
(17) or an overloaded beta cell possibly leading to it being 
more visible to the immune system (18).
Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is 
a hybrid form of diabetes with features of both type 1 
and type 2 diabetes. In addition to sharing autoimmune 
markers (typically glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies 
(GADA)) with type 1 diabetes patients, LADA patients 
also present with (mild to moderate) insulin resistance, 
a feature shared with type 2 diabetes (19). Thus, it is 
possible that intake of sweetened beverages may influence 
the risk of LADA through mechanisms related to either 
autoimmune processes or insulin resistance, but this 
remains to be explored. LADA accounts for 9% of all adult-
onset diabetes (20) and therefore constitutes an important 
part of the diabetes spectrum. Still, potential risk factors 
remain largely unexplored.
We aimed to investigate the risk of LADA and type 2 
 
diabetes in relation to intake of sugar-sweetened and 
artificially sweetened beverage and to explore how it 
relates to markers of insulin resistance, beta cell function 
and autoimmunity.
Subjects and methods
Study population and design
Analyses were based on data from the ESTRID study 
(Epidemiological Study of Risk Factors for LADA and Type 
2 Diabetes), a Swedish population-based case-control 
study initiated in 2010 (Supplementary Fig. 1, see section 
on supplementary data given at the end of this article) 
(21). ESTRID is a sub-study to ANDIS (All New Diabetics 
in Scania; http://andis.ludc.med.lu.se), which is a large 
study aiming to characterize all new diabetes cases within 
the county of Scania (southern Sweden, 1.3 million 
inhabitants) with regard to diabetes type, clinical features 
and genotype. LADA constitutes 5% of all diabetes in the 
ANDIS Registry, all ages included (22). All newly diagnosed 
cases of LADA identified in ANDIS since 2010 have been 
invited to participate in the ESTRID study, together with a 
random sample of incident type 2 diabetes cases in ANDIS 
(4:1 ratio to LADA cases). Since 2012, ESTRID has also 
recruited cases of LADA and type 2 diabetes from ANDiU 
(All New Diabetics in Uppsala; http://www.andiu.se/), 
a study using the ANDIS setup but covering the county 
of Uppsala (in mid-Sweden, 350 
000 inhabitants). The 
Swedish Population Register was used to select a random 
sample of controls who was free of diabetes, aged ≥35 years 
and matched to the cases based on participation date and 
county (incidence density sampling (23)) in a 6:1 ratio to 
LADA cases. A self-administered questionnaire including 
a large number of questions on health and lifestyle factors 
was sent by mail to all cases and controls. Participants 
included in this study were recruited in ESTRID between 
September 2010 and July 2015. The participation rate was 
81% for cases and 66% for controls.
The current analysis excluded those with incomplete 
information on exposure (n 
= 
26) or any of the main 
covariates (family history of diabetes, education, physical 
activity, smoking, alcohol intake and BMI; n 
= 
53). We 
further excluded individuals with reported total daily 
energy intake that deviated more than 3 s.d. from the 
loge-transformed sex-specific mean energy intake (n 
= 
7 
women and n 
= 
11 men). After exclusions, 357 cases of 
LADA, 1136 cases of type 2 diabetes and 1371 controls 
remained for analysis (96% of included cases were 
recruited from ANDIS and 4% from ANDiU). Informed 
consent was provided by all participants. The study has 
been approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board at 
Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.
Serological assays
C-peptide was measured by the Cobas e 601 analyzer 
(Roche Diagnostics) or IMMULITE 2000 (Siemens 
Healthcare Diagnostics Product). GADA was quantitatively 
determined using ELISA (enzyme immunoassay; RSR 
Limited, Cardiff, UK). ELISA gives a maximum value of 
250 
IU/mL and has a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 
98% for a cutoff level of 10.7 
IU/mL (24).
Case definition
All diabetes cases were diagnosed by a physician within 
the regional health care system. Classification into 
diabetes subtype was based on fasting blood samples 
collected at the time of diagnosis. Criteria for LADA 
diagnosis were age ≥35 years, GADA positivity (≥10 IU/
mL) and serum C-peptide exceeding the lower limit

for the normal range as specified by the manufacturer 
(≥0.2 nmol/L for IMMULITE and ≥0.3 nmol/L for 
Cobas). Type 2 diabetes criteria were ≥35 years, GADA 
negativity (<10 IU/mL) and C-peptide levels above 
>0.6 nmol/L (IMMULITE) or >0.72 nmol/L (Cobas). 
There are no unified criteria for LADA diagnosis and 
classification, but the criteria used in this study are 
in line with previous literature (19). The exception is 
C-peptide, which in this study is used as an indicator 
of remaining insulin production to separate LADA from 
type 1 diabetes. It replaces the insulin therapy criterion 
(i.e. no insulin therapy within 6–12 months of diagnosis) 
that is commonly used, but to some extent, open to 
subjectivity because it reflects the assessment made by 
the treating physician. Homeostatic Model Assessment 
for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and beta cell function 
(HOMA-B) were calculated based on fasting plasma 
glucose and C-peptide levels at diagnosis (25).
Dietary assessment
Information on sweetened beverage intake was obtained 
from a semi-quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire 
(FFQ) consisting of 132 items. The participants were asked 
to report their habitual food intake during the preceding 
year. The cases were specifically instructed to report their 
average intake during the year before diagnosis. Four 
questions were asked about sweetened beverage intake: 
cola, other soft drinks/soda, diet cola and other diet soft 
drinks/soda. The participants were asked to report their 
average number of 200 
mL servings per day or per week. 
‘Other soft drink/soda’ also refers to other sweetened 
beverages such as nectars and diluted syrups. The FFQ 
includes a separate question on 100% fruit juice, which 
was not evaluated in this study.
Information on potentially confounding dietary 
factors was also derived from the FFQ. Nutritional data 
from the Swedish National Food Agency database were 
used to estimate the average daily intakes of total energy 
and nutrients based on the FFQ.
The FFQ has been validated against 24-h recall 
interviews (26), diet records (27) and dietary biomarkers 
(28). Validation of individual food items against four 
1-week diet records in a subsample of 129 women indicated 
a correlation of 0.6 for FFQ-reported sweetened beverage 
intake (A Wolk, unpublished results). The FFQ-based 
nutrient estimates have been validated in comparison 
with the mean of fourteen 24-h recall interviews in 248 
men, and showed Spearman correlation coefficients 
ranging from 0.44 (protein) to 0.81 (alcohol) (26).
Other covariate assessment
BMI at age 20 and at present was calculated based on 
self-reported height and weight. Education was assessed 
with a question of the highest attained level of education 
and categorized into elementary school, high school or 
university. Family history of diabetes was categorized as 
yes/no for any type of diabetes in first-degree relatives. 
Leisure time physical activity during the preceding year 
was assessed by a question with four response options 
ranging from sedentary to regularly active. Smoking 
habits were categorized as never smoker, former or current 
smoker. Estimated total alcohol intake was categorized 
into non-consumption, 0.01–4.9 
g/day, 5.0–14.9 
g/day 
and ≥15.0 
g/day.
Statistical analysis
Conditional logistic regression model was used to estimate 
the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) 
of LADA and type 2 diabetes in relation to sweetened 
beverage intake. We analyzed not only the total intake but 
also performed separate analysis for sugar-sweetened and 
artificially sweetened beverages. One serving was defined 
as 200 
mL, and exposure was assessed as continuous as 
wells as categorical (<1, 1–2 and >2 servings per day) 
with non-consumers as reference. ORs are presented after 
adjustment for age and sex (model 1), and with additional 
adjustment for education, family history, physical activity, 
smoking, alcohol intake, total energy intake (kcal/
day) and the following dietary factors in grams per day: 
vegetables, fruit, whole grain, fatty fish, red/processed 
meat, biscuits/sweets/salty snacks and coffee (servings/
day) (model 2). Current BMI was considered to potentially 
be in the causal pathway and was included separately in 
the model (model 3). Results of model 3 are presented in 
the text, unless otherwise specified. Stratified analyses 
were performed using BMI and GADA levels (LADA) 
respectively. Sensitivity analyses included restricting the 
analysis to cases who participated within six months of 
diagnosis and to those not being on dietary treatment 
to minimize reverse causation. To investigate whether 
the association between highly sweetened beverage 
consumption and diabetes reflects increased thirst before 
diagnosis, we assessed the association between water 
consumption and risk of LADA/type 2 diabetes.
Because of the incidence density sampling design, 
the estimated ORs could be interpreted as incidence 
rate ratios (23). Two-sided P values were calculated 
using χ2 (proportions) or Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test

(means and medians). All analyses were performed using 
SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Clinical characteristics
Mean age was 58.8 years for LADA patients, 63.2 years 
for type 2 diabetes patients and 58.5 years for controls 
(Table 1). Patients with LADA had lower BMI and were 
less insulin resistant, but had worse beta cell function 
and were more often treated with insulin after diagnoses 
compared with type 2 diabetes patients. Family history of 
diabetes was almost as common in LADA (45%) as in type 
2 diabetes (50%), but less frequent among controls (24%). 
Median diabetes duration on the date of participation was 
7.5 months for LADA and 5.3 months for type 2 diabetes 
(data not shown in table).
Lifestyle characteristics by category of sweetened 
beverage consumption
The proportion of participants (irrespective of case/
control status) who were non-consumers of both sugar-
sweetened and artificially sweetened beverages was 
63%. High consumers of total sweetened beverages 
(>2 servings per day of sugar-sweetened beverages and 
artificially sweetened beverages) had considerably higher 
BMI than other consumers and the largest annual weight 
gain (1.05% vs 0.72% in non-consumers) since age 20 
(Table 2). In addition, they had generally less favorable 
lifestyle compared with those consuming little or no 
sweetened beverages, including higher prevalence of 
smoking, low physical activity, lower consumption of 
vegetables, fruit, fatty fish and whole grains and higher 
consumption of red/processed meat and biscuits/sweets/
salty snacks. Comparing high consumers of sugar-
sweetened vs artificially sweetened beverages suggests 
that the latter group reported lower total energy intake 
but tended to have higher BMI both at present and at age 
20 (Supplementary Table 1).
LADA and sweetened beverage consumption
The risk of LADA was increased 2-fold (OR: 1.99, 95% 
CI: 1.11–3.56) for the group consuming more than 
two servings of sweetened beverages per day compared 
with non-consumers (Table 3), whereas no excess risk 
was seen in consumers of up to two servings per day. 
At consumption levels exceeding five servings per day 
 
(7 cases/6 controls), an OR of 4.47 (95% CI: 1.21–16.47) 
was observed. Each increment of daily serving conferred 
a 15% increased risk (OR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.02–1.29). The 
results were similar in a more refined analysis of sugar-
sweetened and artificially sweetened beverage intake 
separately, with an OR of 1.18 (95% CI: 1.00–1.39) 
and OR of 1.12, (95% CI: 0.95–1.32) respectively, per 
 
daily serving.
Stratifying the analyses by sex, age, family history of 
diabetes, BMI and median GADA levels (191 
IU/mL) of 
the LADA patients indicated that the excess risk in high 
consumers of sweetened beverages was consistent across 
most subgroups (Supplementary Fig. 2). However, the 
increased risk of LADA was primarily seen in men, but 
analysis of women was based on a very limited number of 
high consumers (6 cases/19 controls).

Type 2 diabetes and sweetened beverage 
consumption
The OR of type 2 diabetes was increased by 2.39 (95% CI: 
1.39–4.09) in those consuming more than two servings 
of sweetened beverages per day compared with non-
consumers (Table 3). Consumption of more than five 
servings per day (18 cases/6 controls) was associated 
with an OR of 10.53 (95% CI: 2.75–40.33). The risk of 
type 2 diabetes was increased by 20% for each daily serving 
increment (OR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.07–1.34). Similar findings 
were seen when assessing sugar-sweetened (OR: 1.21, 95% 
CI: 1.05–1.41) and artificially sweetened beverages (OR: 
1.18, 95% CI: 1.01–1.38) separately. The excess risk in high 
consumers was seen across subgroups of sex, age, family 
history of diabetes and BMI (Supplementary Fig. 3).
HOMA-IR, HOMA-B and GADA
Median HOMA-IR tended to be higher among high 
consumers of sweetened beverages (>2 servings per day) 
compared with that among non-consumers for LADA 
(3.7 vs 2.5, P 
= 
0.0561), and more clearly shown for type 
2 diabetes patients (4.5 vs 3.5, P 
= 
0.0002). In contrast, 
there was a tendency of lower HOMA-B levels among high 
consumers compared with that among non-consumers in 
the LADA patient group (20 vs 48, P 
= 
0.0588 for median). 
This difference was more pronounced among type 2 
diabetes patients (55 vs 70, P 
= 
0.0378). No difference in 
GADA levels was observed in high consumers compared 
with that in non-consumers (250 vs 204, P 
= 
0.6511) 
among LADA patients.
Sensitivity analyses
The results were unchanged when using occupation 
instead of education as an indicator for socioeconomic 
status. Sensitivity analysis conducted to explore reverse 
causation indicated similar results; when restricting the 
analysis to patients responding to the questionnaire within 
six months of diagnosis, the excess risk among high (>2 
servings per day) consumers persisted for both LADA 
(OR: 2.74, 95% CI: 1.16–6.47) and type 2 diabetes (OR: 
2.02, 95% CI: 1.09–3.74). For type 2 diabetes in which 
we had larger number of cases, we could further restrict 
the analysis to cases responding within three months 
and observed a similar association (OR: 3.18, 95% CI: 
1.13–8.95). Exclusion of patients reporting that they were 
on dietary treatment while filling out the questionnaire 
indicated similar results for LADA (OR: 2.01, 95% CI: 
 
1.07–3.78) and type 2 diabetes (OR: 2.15, 95% CI: 1.21–3.83).

between

consumption (as an indicator of excessive thirst during the 
year before diagnosis caused by hyperglycemia) and risk 
of neither LADA (OR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.94–1.02 per daily 
serving) nor type 2 diabetes (OR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.96–1.03).
Discussion
High intake of sweetened beverages was associated with an 
increased risk of LADA; a two-fold increased risk was seen 
in consumers of more than two 200 
mL servings per day, 
and each daily serving increment in sweetened beverage 
intake conferred a 15% increased risk. High consumers also 
experienced a two-fold increased risk of type 2 diabetes 
and a 20% risk increase per serving, which is consistent 
with findings in a recent meta-analysis of prospective data 
(7). The associations were similar in separate analyses of 
sugar-sweetened and artificially sweetened beverages for 
the risk of LADA as well as type 2 diabetes, which has also 
been previously suggested for type 2 diabetes (8).
Proposed mechanisms by which sugar-sweetened 
beverage 
intake 
may 
increase 
diabetes 
risk 
are 
predominantly related to induced insulin resistance (29) 
and include decrease in hepatic insulin sensitivity (30), 
adverse effects of increased insulin demand due to high 
intermittent spikes in blood glucose levels (16) and increase 
in inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (31). 
Another possibility is that the increased risk is mediated by 
increases in overweight (32). In line with previous studies 
on type 2 diabetes (1, 3, 5, 7, 8), the observed positive 
association remained after adjustment for BMI, possibly 
suggesting a direct adverse effect of sweetened beverage 
intake on glucose homeostasis. However, it could be that 
the BMI does not fully indicate the level of visceral fat, 
which is a predictor of type 2 diabetes (33). An effect 
on the development of autoimmunity is also possible. 
Sugar-sweetened beverages have previously been linked 
to type 1 diabetes (13) as well as rheumatoid arthritis 
(34), with suggestions of sugar being involved in causing 
infections and/or inflammation (34). In this study, high 
consumption of sweetened beverages was associated 
with insulin resistance and low beta cell function in type 
2 diabetes patients, with similar tendencies in LADA, 
whereas no association with GADA levels was observed. 
A link between sugar-sweetened beverage intake and 
HOMA-IR was previously reported in adolescents (35, 36). 
Hence, the most plausible explanation may be that the 
excess risk of LADA among high consumers of sweetened 
beverages is related to mechanisms involving insulin 
resistance or other pathophysiological features shared 
with type 2 diabetes. The findings are also supportive of 
the accelerator hypothesis, in which it is postulated that 
beta cell stress caused by insulin resistance activates the 
immune system and consequently accelerates beta cell 
apoptosis leading to manifest diabetes. The intensity 
of the immune response, and hence the tempo of beta 
cell destruction, is suggested to be modulated by genetic 
susceptibility conferred by HLA genes (37).
We also found an excess risk in high consumers of 
artificially sweetened beverages, which is in line with 
previous studies in type 2 diabetes (1, 7). Although not 
containing sugars and thus not contributing to caloric 
intake, it has been suggested that artificially sweetened 
beverages may stimulate appetite, which may lead to 
positive energy balance and weight gain (38). Further, 
artificial sweeteners have also been hypothesized to have 
adverse effects on abdominal fat (39) and gut microbiota 
(12), which may induce glucose intolerance. Alternatively, 
one could speculate that consumers of artificially 
sweetened beverages may have swapped from sugar-
sweetened beverages to prevent further weight gain (39). 
In that case, we may actually be assessing diabetes risk 
related to previous high consumption of sugar-sweetened 
beverages. In line with this explanation, we found the 
highest BMI, both at present and age 20, in the group 
reporting high intakes of artificially sweetened beverages.
The main strength of this study is the population-
based design, with a large number of incident LADA 
patients, and the use of a FFQ that has been thoroughly 
validated against both biomarkers (28) and 24-h recall 
interviews (26), together with information on a wide 
variety of potential confounding factors. For sweetened 
beverage intake, correlation with diet records showed 
good agreement (A Wolk, unpublished results), but 
unfortunately there is no biomarker of such intake. 
Validation of the FFQ questions has been performed in 
another setting, and a number of years ago, however, 
the validation studies included both men and women 
who were all within the same age range as participants 
of this study.
The main limitation is the retrospective design 
that may lead to recall bias. However, for a rare disease 
like LADA, the case–control design is far more efficient 
than the corresponding prospective study, which would 
have required an unrealistically large sample and/or 
follow-up time to yield the same number of cases. In 
this study, patients were meticulously instructed to 
report their dietary habits as they were before diabetes 
diagnosis, but some patients may have reduced their

consumption of sweetened beverages since diagnosis 
and report accordingly. Still, this would not lead us to 
overestimate the risk in high consumers, but rather the 
opposite. The fact that the patients were asked to recall 
their consumption of sweetened beverages as they were 
before diagnosis, whereas the controls were asked to recall 
their intake during the year directly before participation 
date, may introduce bias. In an attempt to minimize 
such recall bias, analysis were run separately for patients 
filling out the questionnaire within six months and 
three months of diagnosis, and excluded those who 
were treated by diet modification, but the results were 
similar. Some controls may have undiagnosed diabetes. 
This would make controls more similar to the cases with 
regard to lifestyle and hence dilute the true associations 
between intake of sweetened beverages and diabetes risk. 
Bias would be introduced if the participating controls are 
not representative of the population generating the cases, 
i.e. inhabitants of the counties of Scania and Uppsala, 
with regard to both sweetened beverage intake and other 
covariates. In a comparison using data of the general 
population, we found that the participating controls are 
equivalent with regard to educational level (data from 
Statistics Sweden, www.scb.se).
One could also speculate that the high consumption 
of sweetened beverages reported by patients reflects 
greater thirst in the period preceding diagnosis due to 
hyperglycemia. This is difficult to assess, but we noted 
that these patients did not report excess intake of water. 
Finally and most importantly for the credibility of these 
findings with regard to type 2 diabetes, our results were 
in line with previous reports based on prospective data 
with diet reported a several years before diagnosis (1, 3). 
False-positive LADA patients, i.e. truly type 2 diabetes 
(i.e. GADA negative) patients, but misclassified as LADA, 
could drive the results for LADA in the same direction as 
that of type 2 diabetes. However, this is unlikely to fully 
explain the observed association for LADA considering 
the high specificity of the GADA assay and the fact that 
the same magnitude of association was also observed 
among LADA patients with high GADA levels. Another 
explanation for our findings could be that high intake 
of sweetened beverages simply is a marker of an overall 
poor lifestyle leading onto the trajectory toward diabetes 
onset. We did observe that high consumers had an 
unhealthier lifestyle in general, and the highest BMI, 
both currently and at age 20, and the greatest weight gain 
since age 20. The excess risk in high consumers did persist 
after adjustment for a wide range of dietary and lifestyle 
factors including BMI, but we cannot rule out residual 
confounding due to unmeasured or imprecisely measured 
factors, such as BMI, energy intake or socio-demographic 
factors, as an explanation for our results. The group of 
high consumers constitutes 6% of the study participants, 
but it is noteworthy that among participants below age 
50, 12% consume such high levels.
In conclusion, these findings add support to the 
accumulating evidence suggesting that high intake 
of sweetened beverages, both sugar-sweetened and 
artificially sweetened, is a potential risk factor for type 
2 diabetes. Importantly, these findings indicate that the 
adverse health effects seen with high sweetened beverage 
intake also encompass autoimmune forms of diabetes. 
The excess risk seems not to be fully explained by 
caloric intake or BMI, opening up for other explanations 
possibly including direct adverse effects of sweetened 
beverages on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. 
The suggested positive association between artificially 
sweetened beverages and diabetes risk remains to be 
further explored. This study supports the notion that 
dietary factors may influence LADA development (21, 40, 
41). This is important as the identification of modifiable 
risk factors could aid in preventing autoimmune diabetes. 
It is especially urgent in times when diabetes prevalence 
is on the rise (42) and sweetened beverage consumption 
continues to be high (43).
