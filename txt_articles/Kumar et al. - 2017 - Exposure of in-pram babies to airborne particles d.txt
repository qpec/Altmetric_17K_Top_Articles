Abstract 
In-pram babies are more susceptible to air pollution effects, yet studies assessing their exposure 
are limited. We measured size-resolved particle mass (PMC; 0.25-32 µm) and number (PNC; 
0.2–1 µm) concentrations on a 2.7 km route. The instruments were placed inside a baby pram. 
The route passed through 4 traffic intersections (TIs) and a bus stand. A total of ~87 km road 
length was covered through 64 trips, made during school drop-in (morning) and pick-up 
(afternoon) hours. The objectives were to assess PMC and PNC exposure to in-pram babies at 
different route segments, understand their physicochemical characteristics and exposure 
differences between in-pram babies and adults carrying them. Over 5-fold variability (14.1–
78.2 µg m-3) was observed in PMCs. Small-sized particles, including ultrafine particles, were 
always higher by 66% (PM1), 29% (PM2.5) and 31% (PNC) during the morning than afternoon. 
Coarse particles (PM2.5-10) showed an opposite trend with 70% higher concentration during 
afternoon than morning. TIs emerged as pollution hotspots for all the particle types. For 
example, PM2.5, PM2.5-10 and PNCs during the morning (afternoon) at TIs were 7 (10)%, 19 
(10)% and 68 (62)% higher, respectively, compared with the rest of the route. Bus stand was 
also a section of enhanced exposure to PNC and PM2.5, although not so much for PM2.5-10. EDX 
analyses revealed Cl, Na and Fe as dominant elements. Road salt might be a source of NaCl 
due to de-icing during the measurements while Fe contributed by non-exhaust emissions from 
brake abrasion. The respiratory deposition rates imitated the trend of PMC, with higher doses 
of coarse and fine particles during the afternoon and morning runs, respectively. Special 
protection measures during conveyance of in-pram babies, especially at pollution hotspots such 
as traffic intersections and bus stands, could help to limit their exposure.  
Capsule  
Exposure assessment of in-pram babies showed much higher fine and ultrafine particles at 
traffic intersections and bus stands during morning (drop-in) than afternoon (pick-up) hours.

Introduction 
The negative effects of air pollution exposure on the public health are clearly evident 
(Heal et al., 2012). A large number of epidemiological studies have associated the exposure to 
air pollutants to a wide range of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (among others) and an 
increase in mortality (Atkinson et al., 2015). For example, Lim et al. (2012) quantified the 
global burden of disease and attributed 3.2 million premature deaths and 3.1% of global 
disability-adjusted life years to ambient particulate matter (PM).  
Children are considered to be the population group that is most susceptible to environmental

exposures, because of their immature and developing systems, higher inhalation rates and 
lower body weight with respect to adults (Ashmore and Dimitroulopoulou 2009; Goldman 
1995; Peled 2011). Past studies reported the association of increased risk of respiratory diseases 
and infant mortality with the exposure to air pollutants (Landrigan and Etzel 2014). Some 
studies have also observed an association of early-life exposure (including the first year of life) 
to air pollutants with the childhood asthma (Deng et al., 2015; Clark et al., 2010), allergic 
rhinitis (Deng et al., 2016) and an impaired cognitive development (Basagaña et al., 2016; 
Sunyer et al., 2016). However, studies showing exposure levels of the infants to particle 
number (PNC) and mass (PMC) concentrations (Table 1) are still sparse and therefore 
considered as a part of our investigation in this work.    
The urban environments are characterised by appreciable particle number and mass emissions 
from road traffic and the other anthropogenic sources (Kumar et al., 2016; Kumar et al., 2011; 
Kumar et al., 2015a). Traditionally, exposure to air pollutants has been assessed through fixed-
site air quality monitoring stations measuring at the background or traffic hotspots (Goel and 
Kumar 2014), but these stations might not be representative of the actual air pollution exposure 
(Kumar et al., 2015b; Steinle et al., 2013). This is particularly true during commuting since this 
activity results in an increased exposure when compared to other daily activities and is 
characterised by a high exposure to time ratio (Buonanno et al., 2013a; Dons et al., 2011; Rivas 
et al., 2016,  2017), especially in high vehicle density areas (Goel and Kumar 2015a). The 
reasons for this intense exposure is the proximity to the source (with levels of most air 
pollutants being particularly high along the busy roads) and the peak concentrations being 
usually observed during the peak traffic hours (Al-Dabbous and Kumar 2014; Kaur et al., 2005; 
Morawska et al., 2008; Rivas et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2002). Particularly high PNC are to be 
expected on the signalised traffic intersections (TI) due to delay and stop-start conditions of 
the road vehicles (Goel and Kumar 2015a, b).    
Pollutant concentration may vary both horizontally and vertically across the city (Goel and 
Kumar 2016; Kumar et al., 2008c). Because of their height, children during commuting are 
relatively closer to the traffic emissions than adults since vehicle tailpipes are usually at a height 
around 30-60 cm above the ground level. Previous studies observed an exponential decrease 
with height in concentrations of particle numbers and gaseous pollutants (Goel and Kumar 
2016; Kumar et al., 2008b; Kumar et al., 2008c; Vardoulakis et al., 2002). These studies build 
a generic understanding that much higher concentrations are expected close to the road and 
thus in the breathing zone of the children.  
A few studies have reported exposure assessments at a different height within the first 2 m 
above the ground that might capture the differences between the children and adults (Table 1). 
For example, Buzzard et al. (2009) reported that short-term (1.5s, 2.5s) averaged maximum

concentrations of PM at adult head height (~1.65 m at the mouth level) were on average half 
of those observed at the corresponding height of an infant in a pram (~0.85 m). Likewise, other 
studies showed PNCs to be about 10% higher at 0.55 m (pram height) than at 1.70 m, which 
corresponds to an adult face height (Garcia-Algar et al., 2014). Another study by Burtscher and 
Schüepp (2012) observed 35% higher concentrations of ultrafine particles in a bicycle trailer 
where a child was located compared with those observed at the breathing height of the bicycle 
driver. On the contrary, Galea et al. (2014) concluded that children in buggies are exposed to 
lower PM2.5 concentrations than the adults pushing the pram. The morphological and chemical 
composition of particles is of great importance since these parameters are determinants of the 
toxicity (De Vizcaya-Ruiz et al., 2006; Decan et al., 2016).  Hence, health impairments and 
their degree might diverge among inhaled materials; although epidemiological studies are still 
scarce in assessing the effects of individual PM components (Bell 2012; Bilenko et al., 2015; 
Wyzga and Rohr 2015). Off-line samples can be analysed in the laboratory using microanalysis 
techniques such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to determine morphology and energy 
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to characterise elemental composition, as used in several 
environmental studies (Azarmi et al., 2015; Chithra and Shiva Nagendra 2013; Moreno et al., 
2015a; Mouzourides et al., 2015; Slezakova et al., 2011). 
Besides a limited amount of literature on exposure of babies in the prams, the datasets used in 
these studies was very limited. Therefore, due to high vulnerability of children (and especially 
for babies during their first month and years), the assessment of exposure of babies to traffic 
emissions is of extreme importance and form part of the objectives of this work. 
The objectives of this study are to assess exposure to PMC and PNC in various size ranges 
while travelling in their prams during the morning and afternoon school pick-up/drop-in times. 
In particular, we aim to (i) determine the concentrations measured inside the baby prams and 
identify the main pollution hotspots of air pollution, (ii) quantify the PM and UFP exposure 
and associated particles dose of the babies, (iii) assess the physicochemical characteristics of 
the particles inhaled by the babies, and (iv) compare the difference in exposures between the 
babies in the pram and the adult pushing it.

 Methodology 
2.1 
Site description 
 
The experiment was carried out on a fixed route starting from the University of Surrey 
to the Sandfield Primary School in the town centre of Guildford, UK (Figure 1). Most parents 
carry their babies when dropping-off (morning) and picking-up (afternoon) their school 
children. The route was selected within the school catchment area so that it is representative of 
a possible typical route. Only weekdays were considered for monitoring since no school 
activities take place during the weekend. A total of 64 one-sided runs, giving a total of 32 round 
trips (University of Surrey – Sandfield Primary School – University of Surrey), were made for

personal exposure monitoring of in-pram babies; of which 17 runs took place in the morning 
(starting 0800 h, local time) and 15 in the afternoon (starting at 1500 h, local time). The total 
length of the route was 2.7 km and it took an average of 36.2±2.4 min to walk. The time spent 
on the route was similar during both the morning (35.6±2.3 min) and the afternoon (36.9±2.3 
min) runs.  
The route was designed to cross the maximum number of TIs and a central bus stand in order 
to understand the spatial variability in personal exposure.  The selected routed passed through 
the Guildford Bus Station and 5 signalised TIs (Figure 1). The area surrounding the University 
of Surrey has a low traffic density since none of the main streets passes across the campus. 
However, local buses frequently cross the campus which may lead to intermittent increments 
of air pollutants concentrations. The rest of the route goes through a high congested traffic 
zone. After leaving the University, the route goes on a parallel road to the train railways, passes 
in front of the Guildford main train station, through the bus station and across some residential 
area (Figure 1). The Sandfield Primary School is located on a busy street, and it was the final 
destination of the route. 
2.2  
Instrumentation and data collection 
 
A GRIMM EDM 107 (GRIMM Technologies Inc.) aerosol spectrometer was used for 
measuring particles in the 0.25–32 µm diameter range. The flow of the instrument was 
controlled by an internal pump and kept at 1.2 l min-1. The instrument reported PM 
concentrations at a time resolution of 6 sec. It was calibrated just before the measurements and 
has been successfully deployed in our previous mobile measurements (Azarmi and Kumar 
2016; Kumar and Goel 2016). 
A P-Trak 8525 (TSI Inc.) was employed for measuring PNC in the 0.2–1 µm size range. P-
Trak is not able to measure particles in the nucleation mode (<20 nm), what might lead to an 
underestimation of the actual PNC measured in our study (Mishra et al., 2012; Rivas et al., 
2017). Actually, previous studies in urban environments (including street canyons) have shown 
that traffic emissions contribute importantly to the nucleation mode, with a peak below 0.02 
µm (Gidhagen et al., 2005; Kumar et al., 2008a; Wehner et al., 2002). 
A Dylos DC1700 (Dylos Corp.) particulate matter monitor was used for PNC measurements 
of small (0.5-2.5 µm in aerodynamic diameter) and large (>2.5 µm) particles. It is a particle 
counter based on light-scattering technology (laser beam operating at 650 nm wavelength) that 
was initially developed for indoor air quality monitoring (Dylos 2016). The output of the Dylos 
is particle counts per cubic foot (28.38 lit) of air. The upper concentration limit has been found 
out by Semple et al. (2013) in chamber experiments to be 65,356 particles per 0.01 cubic foot 
(equivalent to approximately 1,000 µg m-3 for PM2.5), which is an unlikely concentration to be

reached in a typical urban environment, except if being very close to a combustion source such 
as vehicle tailpipes (Kumar et al., 2009). Previous studies have evaluated the performance of 
the Dylos, both in indoor and outdoor environments, and indicated that the Dylos is able to 
accurately determine particle size and operate at a wide range of particle concentration while 
providing similar results to other available monitors (Northcross et al., 2013). However, Steinle 
et al. (2015) indicated that Dylos (as a low-cost air pollution monitor) is not aimed to deliver a 
precision similar to the reference monitors, but to offer an indication of exposure to PM.  
The position of both the pram and the instruments was continuously recorded on a second basis 
(i.e. 1 Hz) using a Global Positioning System (GPS; Garmin Oregon 550). The instruments 
were placed inside a baby pram to mimic the exposure that a baby would receive while being 
strolled in a pram. The instruments inside the pram were placed at a height of 0.7 m above the 
floor. The pram was always pushed in the sidewalk, within a varying distance from the road 
traffic (between 0.3 and 2 m distance, depending on the sidewalk width). 
The Dylos was placed inside the pram for about one-quarter of total runs together with the 
GRIMM particle spectrometer in order to develop a correlation with their measured PMC in 
real-world operational conditions, as seen in Supplementary Information, SI, Figure S1; we 
then used this correlation to make Dylos data comparable to the GRIMM instrument for the 
rest of the runs at the adult height. From run 17 onwards, the Dylos was carried by the pushing 
adult in order to quantify the exposure of the adult pushing the baby and compare it with the 
exposure received by the baby in the pram. The Dylos was placed close to the adult breathing 
zone between 1.40 and 1.60 m by means of Velcro straps with the inlet looking at the front. A 
protective cover was placed over the buttons to prevent accidental switch-off of the instrument.  
A total of 32 round mobile runs resulted in a 6 sec averaged 22594 data points (37.7h) for 
GRIMM, 1 sec averaged 129583 data points (36.0h) for P-Trak, and 1 min averaged 22594 
data points (10.6h) for the Dylos in the adult position. 
2.4   
SEM and EDS analysis 
Total PM mass was collected on PTFE filters with a diameter of 47mm and a nominal 
thickness of ≈1000 µg cm-2 using GRIMM 1.107. A total of 3 samples were collected, all of 
them corresponding to the same route but different days of collection as described in Table S1. 
A blank filter was also included in the analysis for setting up a reference case. 
After carbon coating of the sample surface, particles from all samples were characterised using 
a JEOL SEM (model JSM-7100F, Japan) with a spatial resolution (depending on the sample) 
of 1.2 nm at 30 kV and 3.0 nm at 1kV. The JEOL SEM was equipped with EDS, thus being 
able of obtaining information on morphology and elemental composition (semi-quantitative 
analysis) of the particles collected on the filters. The analyses were carried out at the

Exposure assessment 
 
The respiratory deposition dose (RDD) is the product of PMC, deposition fraction (DF) 
and ventilation rate (VR). The PMC depends only on the outside environment, the DF on 
particle characteristics (size in particular) and, finally, the VR depends on the age, sex and the 
activity a subject is performing. The DF varies according to the particle diameter and hence is 
usually not directly proportional to the mass concentration.  The RDD is estimated according 
to Eq. (1), which is adapted from ICRP (1994) and has been used extensively in the literature 
(Azarmi and Kumar 2016; Goel and Kumar 2015a).

Where VRj is the ventilation rate for the jth individual; DFi and PMi are the DF and PMC for 
each of the ith PM fraction, respectively. DFs were calculated with the mass median diameter

Results and discussions  
3.1 
In-pram PMC during mobile measurements  
Figure 2 shows the different fractions of PMC during the morning and afternoon runs. 
A large variability of concentrations was observed between the runs, showing differences up 
to a factor of 7 between the runs averaged concentrations (Figures 2a-b, Table S2). Run 
averaged PM10 ranged from 14.1 to 78.2 µg m-3 during morning runs compared with 18.3 to 
120 µg m-3 during afternoon runs (Figures 2a-b, Table S2).  
The t-test was performed on the data to assess statistically significant differences. A run-wise 
average of on-road afternoon PM10 concentrations (44.0±26.3 µg m–3) was 16% higher than 
during the morning (37.8±16.8 µg m–3; significant p-value <0.001; Figure 2). This difference 
was in the opposite direction and much more marked for PM2.5 and PM1, having 31 and 47% 
higher concentrations during the morning (PM2.5 = 21.5±14.7 µg m–3, PM1= 15.4±15.7 µg m–
3, p-value <0.001 in both cases) than in the afternoon runs (PM2.5 = 16.4±11.8 µg m–3; PM1 = 
10.5±10.7 µg m–3; Figure 2). This results in the PM2.5-10 being significantly higher (70%) in 
afternoons (27.6±17.6 µg m–3) compared with morning runs (16.3±8.5 µg m–3; p-value 
<0.001). Coarse particles are mainly primary particles generated by mechanical processes 
(Heal et al., 2012) and vehicles can importantly contribute to this fraction by the resuspension 
of road dust and tyre and brake wear emissions (Amato et al., 2009a; Kumar et al., 2013). On 
the other side, exhaust emissions contribute more importantly to the fine fraction (Viana et al., 
  
Cite this article as: Kumar, P., Rivas, I., Sachdeva, L., 2017. Exposure of in-pram babies to airborne particles during 
morning drop-in and afternoon pick-up of school children. Environment Pollution, doi:10.1016/j.envpol.2017.02.021

2008).  The lower concentration of coarse particles during the morning runs might be due to 
the moisture content of the pavement during early morning (owing to the overnight 
condensation of water due to cold temperatures), which drops the mobility and resuspension 
of road dust (Amato et al., 2012; Omstedt et al., 2005). Although having a higher traffic 
intensity during the morning, re-suspension was kept to a minimum owing to the settling of 
particles because of the wetness of the pavement from the overnight dew. Therefore, higher re-
suspension of coarser particles was observed during the afternoon when drier road conditions 
persisted. However, fresh exhaust emissions are responsible for the higher PMC in the fine 
fraction during the morning runs. This resulted in about 10% higher total PMCs during the 
afternoon runs. In fact, this also explains the much higher proportion of the coarse fraction to 
the total PMC during the afternoon (63%) than during the morning (43%) runs.  
A handful of literature is available on exposure to in-pram babies (Table 1). One study on this 
topic is of Galea et al. (2014) who measured PM2.5 measurements in the city of Edinburgh 
(UK). They performed 6 runs in each of their three selected routes obtaining a range of 
geometric mean (GM) between 5.9 and 46.6 µg m-3, which is similar to the range between 4.8 
and 63.5 µg m-3 of GM that we obtained. 
3.2 
Effect of pollution hotspots on enhanced PMC exposure to babies 
In order to understand the spatial variability of coarse and fine particles at different 
parts of the route, Figure 3 shows the spatial variation of PM2.5-10 (corresponding to the 
afternoon run #12 up) and PM2.5 (morning run #25 down). Run #12 up and #25 down were 
selected because their corresponding average PMC (PM2.5-10 in #12 up as 21.8 µg m-3 and PM2.5 
in run #25 down as 19.3 µg m-3; Table S2) that were closest to the overall average 
concentrations (21.6 and 19.1 µg m–3, respectively). High concentrations were observed at 
different points of the route, owing to traffic congestion and the surrounding built-up 
environment. However,  high concentrations were consistently observed next to TIs (Figure 3) 
which has also been reported in previous studies involving pedestrians (Kumar and Goel 2016; 
Moreno et al., 2015b).  
Figure 4 shows the concentrations at different sections of the route: TIs, bus stand and rest of 
the route (i.e., excluding TIs and bus stand) During the morning runs, the average concentration 
of PM2.5-10 and PM2.5 at TIs (18.8±12.2 and 22.5±15.9 µg m-3) were 19 and 7% significantly 
higher than at the rest of the route (p-value <0.001 from the t-test in both cases), which had 
corresponding values as PM2.5 (and PM2.5-10) as 21.0±14.3 (15.8±7.9) µg m-3, respectively 
(Table S3). In the afternoons at TIs, PM2.5-10 (30.1±17.2 µg m-3) and PM2.5 (17.5±12.3 µg m-3) 
were both by about 10% higher than the corresponding values (27.5±18.1 and 16.0±11.8 µg m-
3; p-values for PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 were <0.001 and 0.03, respectively) at the rest of the route. 
Therefore, concentrations of both coarse and fine particles were slightly higher at the TIs

compared with the rest of the route (Figure 4). These higher concentrations can be explained 
due to abrupt changes in driving conditions (e.g., braking, acceleration/deceleration), 
temporary accumulation of vehicles (Kim et al., 2013; Kumar and Goel 2016) and an increase 
in fuel consumption due to the acceleration of vehicles (Goel and Kumar 2015a).  
Taking a deeper look into PMCs around the TIs, we can observe the highest average 
concentrations at TI1 and TI2 (boxplots in Figure S2, values in Table S3). TI1 is surrounded by 
buildings that greatly limit the dispersion of pollutants (Ai and Mak 2015; Weber et al., 2006) 
while TI2 is the busiest intersection in the route but located in a more open area that favours 
the dispersion. This explains why TI1 has 11% higher concentrations for PM2.5 than the rest of 
TIs and showing usually higher concentrations than TI2. Generally, TIs also followed the 
overall trend in which respective concentrations of PM2.5 are relatively higher during the 
morning than the afternoon but an opposite trend was seen for PM2.5-10 for the similar reasons 
discussed in Section 3.1.  
At the bus stand, coarse particles were by about 5% (15.0±9.0 µg m-3) and 25% lower than the 
rest of the route during the morning (no significant differences, p-value = 0.36) and afternoon 
(significant differences, p-value <0.001) hours, respectively. On the other hand, fine particles 
were by about 12% (23.5±13.7 µg m-3) and 21% significantly higher than the rest of the route 
during the morning (p-value = 0.027) and afternoon (p-value = 0.013) hours, respectively. The 
higher concentrations of fine particles can be explained from exhaust emissions by the running 
engines of idling buses when passengers get on and off the buses (Figure 4a). Conversely, these 
stationary idling buses limit the re-suspension of coarse particles explaining their lower 
concentrations at the bus stands (Figure 4b).  
3.3 
In-pram PNC during mobile measurements 
  Figure 5 shows the average PNC for the morning and afternoon trips. The run-wise 
average PNC was 10155±6030 cm-3 and 7739±5004 cm-3 during the morning and afternoon 
runs, respectively (Figure 5a–b). The average PNC was 31% significantly higher during the 
morning than afternoon runs (p-value <0.001), similar to what was observed for PM2.5. These 
results were the expected since the traffic emissions are an important source of ultrafine 
particles (Kumar et al., 2014; Morawska et al., 2008) and the highest traffic intensities took 
place during the morning runs.  The average PNCs inside the baby pram were much lower than 
those reported by roadside measurements in different cities of the UK (Agus et al., 2007; 
Kumar et al., 2014; Longley et al., 2003; Reche et al., 2011; von Bismarck-Osten et al., 2013), 
although these studies included smaller particles in their measured PNCs. Since traffic 
emissions substantially contribute to the nucleation mode particles, especially below 20 nm 
(Gidhagen et al., 2005; Kumar et al., 2008a; Wehner et al., 2002), an underestimation from the 
P-Trak is expected because of its detection limit being 20 nm. Garcia-Algar et al. (2015; Table 
1) also measured PNC concentrations in the same range (with P-Trak) in different roadside

routes in a baby pram in the city of Barcelona, obtaining an average PNC of 48198±25296 cm-
3. Their value is about 5-times higher than the average PNCs we measured in Guildford. This 
difference can be explained by the higher background PNC found in Barcelona than in other 
UK cities which are busier than Guildford (Kumar et al., 2014) and also that their routes were 
entirely monitored in street canyons characterised by heavy traffic. 
Following the methodology used in Section 3.2, we plotted the run (#24 down) that has the trip 
average PNC closest to the overall average of all runs for assessing the spatial variability 
(Figure 6). A large variability in average concentrations was noted, showing up to a factor of 
8 during the morning (2965-23014 cm-3) and a factor of 14 during the afternoon (1819-25079 
cm-3). PNC at the route section within the University campus were low because of low traffic 
volume. Thereafter the concentrations started to increase to high levels when approaching the 
city centre. PNC was found to be consistently higher near the traffic intersection and bus stand 
compared with the rest of the route (Figure 6d). For example, PNC at TIs during the morning 
(14908±8982 cm-3) and afternoon (11031±6683 cm-3) runs were 68% and 62% significantly 
higher than the corresponding values at the rest of the route (8890±5682 cm-3 and 6813±4850 
cm-3; p-value <0.001 in both cases; Table 2). As previously observed for PM2.5 in Section 3.2 
(Figure S3), TI1 showed the highest concentration among the rest of TIs (around 50% higher) 
owing to the higher vehicle density in this section of the route and the hindered dispersion by 
the surrounding buildings. Regarding the influence of the bus stand, PNCs were also much 
higher in this route section. In line with the PM2.5 (Section 3.2), PNC during the morning 
(14396±9690 cm-3) and the afternoon (11534±6809 cm-3) were 62 and 69% significantly higher 
at the bus stand than at the rest of the route (p-value <0.001 in both cases), respectively, 
maintain their reputation as zones of high pollution exposure (Goel and Kumar 2014, 2015b). 
3.4 
Comparison of babies and adult exposure 
We measured PM2.5 concentrations at adult heights to compare with those measured 
simultaneously inside the baby pram (Figure S4). A huge variability in mean concentration was 
noted during the morning (9.6–36.3 µg m-3) and afternoon (9.1–19.6 µg m-3) runs for babies. 
The corresponding range was comparatively smaller for adults during the morning (9.6–46.1 
µg m-3) and afternoon runs (8.3–16.7 µg-m-3). The mean concentration for overall runs was 
found out to be nearly identical for babies (16.4±9.3 µg m-3) and adults (16.9±10.6 µg m-3, p-
value = 0.102). However, PM2.5 concentrations for babies were about 5% significantly lower 
than adults during the morning (p-value = 0.016) runs as opposed to 10% higher for babies 
during the afternoon runs (p-value <0.001). Although a different instrument was used for adults 
and babies, the correlation between them was fairly good (R2 = 0.94; Figure S1). We can only 
compare these results to another study assessing PM2.5 concentrations in a baby pram (Galea et 
al., 2014). Their results indicate that adults were exposed to higher concentrations than babies. 
However, their monitoring was limited to only 6 days; they obtained the opposite result (i.e.,

-11- 
 
babies exposed to higher concentrations) on one of their six days of monitoring. More long-
term studies could further help to establish an exposure gradient between the in-pram babies 
and adults.  
Further inspection of the data for the different parts of the route (Figures 9c-d) showed the 
mean PM2.5 concentration for babies was 5.0 (significant, p-value <0.045), 6.0 (not 
significantly different, p-value <0.290) and 5.7% (not significantly different, p-value  <0.515) 
lower than adults during the morning hours for the rest of the route, traffic intersection and bus 
stand sections, respectively. For example, average PM2.5 during morning hours were 17.2±9.8 
µg m-3 (rest of route), 17.6±8.7 µg m-3 (traffic intersection) and 19.4±16.5 µg m-3 (bus stand) 
for babies compared with 18.1±11.4 µg m-3 (rest of the route), 18.6±12.3 µg m-3 (traffic 
intersection) and 20.5±10.1 µg m-3 (bus stand) for adults. The trend changed during the 
afternoon hours when the mean PM2.5 concentrations for babies were 12.5 (significant, p-value 
<0.001), 1 (not significantly different, p-value <0.724) and 7.7% (not significantly different, 
p-value <0.508) higher during the rest of the route (13.2±5.6 µg m-3), traffic intersections 
(14.0±5.5 µg m-3) and bus stand (14.0±4.7 µg-m-3), respectively, compared with the adults 
experiencing 11.7±3.8 µg m-3, 13.8±3.1 µg m-3 and 13.0±3.2 µg-m-3 during the rest of the route, 
traffic intersections and bus stand, respectively. While our results indicate relatively higher 
exposure to PM2.5 to babies during the afternoon runs and lower during the morning hours, past 
studies also show similar kind of mixed results. For example, Galea et al. (2014) compared the 
PM2.5 concentrations inside a baby pram and at the adult height at 3 different routes over the 6 
days of measurements. They generally observed higher exposures of the adults for most days 
when adult to baby ratios varied between 1.10 and 1.76. They observed an exception on one 
day when an opposite trend was seen, with an adult to baby ratios being between 0.84 and 0.87; 
no particular reason for this reversed trend was provided.  
Exploring the differences between babies and adults at the different TIs (Table S4) showed no 
consistent results; sometimes higher exposures for babies than for adults and vice-versa, with 
most of the TI showing a difference <5% (and always no statistically significant differences). 
For example, adult to baby ratios at the TIs ranged from 0.97–1.18 during the morning, which 
changed to 0.88–1.14 during the afternoon. This is expected given that the first few meter 
height of the TIs is highly affected by the traffic-induced turbulence due to stop-start, 
acceleration/deceleration conditions (Di Sabatino et al., 2003; Kumar et al., 2008a) and so is 
the case with the varied emissions and their dispersion (Goel and Kumar 2014, 2015a) 
contributing to the observed trend.   
3.5 
Physicochemical properties of the particles 
The morphology and the chemical composition was characterised using SEM (Figure 
7) and EDS techniques (Table S5). These analyses were performed on the bulk mass of total

-12- 
 
PM collected on 3 different filter samples (Table S1). The particles show a wide range of 
morphologies under the SEM, from agglomerates (related to vehicle exhaust emissions), crustal 
forms (related to mineral components), as well as the presence of some fibres, probably coming 
from the fabric of the pram (Figure 7). As expected, the EDS analysis of the blank PTFE filters 
showed the filter composition, being 88.9 wt% fluorine (F) and 10.8 wt% carbon (C); Table 
S5. Analysis through SEM-EDS are semi-quantitative, and only the relative contribution of 
each element was quantified for a specific section of the filter. In Samples 1 and 3, the dominant 
elements are chlorine (Cl), sodium (Na), iron (Fe), and oxygen (O); excluding F and C that are 
affected by the filter composition. Road salt can be considered an important contributor to PM 
in form of sodium chloride (NaCl, characterised by a crystal form) since the measurements 
were carried out in the winter time when salt is commonly used for de-icing or anti-icing of the 
roads, especially in the early morning. Fe is a typical crustal element, which is usually found 
in the form of iron oxides (Fe2O3). However, its higher proportion with respect to other crustal 
elements (Si, Al, Mg) suggests a clear contribution from road traffic, being Fe a tracer of non-
exhaust emissions from brake abrasion and commonly found in city dust profiles (Amato et al., 
2009b). In Sample 3, the EDS analysis also revealed the presence of Cu in a low wt% (Table 
S5), which is also a tracer for brake wear (Thorpe and Harrison 2008). Sample 3 corresponds 
to the sample with the highest bulk mass, mainly due to a higher number of runs, and therefore 
Cu might have become detectable for the EDS.  
3.6 
Exposure assessment  
The RDD provides the net influx of the PM into the respiratory system and is often 
cited as the most important factor in determining the ability to adversely affecting the human 
body. The deposition fraction varies according to the particle diameter and therefore is usually 
not directly proportional to the mass concentration. We estimated the RDD of different PM 
fractions for male and female babies during morning and afternoon runs in different parts of 
the route (Figure 8). As stated in Section 2.5, the RDD is a product of mass concentration, DF 
and VR (Eq. 1). The former two depends only on the outside environment whereas the 
ventilation rate depends on the age, sex and the activity, a person is performing. The ventilation 
rate for the male and female babies of age (<1 year) in sedentary condition is taken as 3.18 and 
3.00 lit min-1 (US EPA 2009). Since the outside environment is same for both male and female 
babies during the calculation, the ratio of RDD of the male to the female babies will be fixed 
as 1.06 at any particular location during any period of the day. Therefore, we only discussed 
the results for female babies in the subsequent text and the RDD for male babies can be 
obtained by multiplying the above-noted factor for female babies. 
The total RDD rates, which is a sum of fine and coarse particles, for female babies were found 
to vary substantially from run to run (Figure 8), within a range of 1.2–11.6 µg h–1 and 3.0–20.4 
µg h–1 during the morning and afternoon runs, respectively. The separation of the data

suggested showed around 41% lower average RDD for coarse particles during morning runs 
(2.8±1.4 µg h–1) compared with afternoon runs (4.7±2.9 µg h–1; significant, p-value <0.001). 
The corresponding difference reduced to 10% for fine particles, with 1.1±0.6 µg h–1 during 
morning compared with 1.0±0.6 µg h–1 during the afternoon (significant, p-value <0.001). This 
effect was also reflected in the fraction of RDD that changed from 72% (morning) to 83% 
(afternoon) for coarse particles and from 28% (morning) to 17% (afternoon) for fine particles 
(Figure 8). The RDD rates mimic the trend of PMC. The abundance of fine particles during the 
morning hours was expected due to higher vehicle density, as discussed in Section 3.1. 
Moreover, the wetness of road pavement due to overnight dew and the higher relatively 
humidity during the morning (84.9±6.5%) compared with afternoon (71.4±12.5%) might have 
contributed to limit the re-suspension of coarse particles during morning runs, as also reported 
by previous studies (Kumar and Goel 2016). The studies quantifying the RDD for babies are 
scarce for direct comparison. We used a study that estimated RDD for walking along the urban 
roadsides to put our results in perspective.  For example, Nyhan et al., (2014) determined the 
RDD for 8 adult pedestrians in Dublin and obtained an RDD of 27.6 µg h–1 for PM2.5 and 40.8 
µg h–1 for PM10, which are much higher than the ones we obtained for in-pram babies. Various 
factors might explain these differences. Firstly, our average concentrations were lower (overall 
PM2.5 = 19.1 µg m–3; PM10 = 40.7 µg m–3) than theirs (PM2.5 = 28.2 µg m–3; PM10 = 45.8 µg m–
3). Secondly, a major effect might be due to the different inhalation rates, which depend on age 
and intensity of physical activity. The pedestrians assessed by Nyhan et al. (2014) were adults 
undergoing a moderate exercise (walking) while the in-pram babies were considered in resting 
position.  The ventilation rate for a male adult (30-40 years old) is 30.30 lit min-1 compared 
with 3.08 lit min-1 for a baby in a sedentary condition (sedentary condition; <1 yr) (US EPA 
2009), giving an order of magnitude difference and explaining the low RDD in our case for in-
pram babies.  
In order to assess the spatial variability in the exposure doses over the route, we further 
analysed the data by dividing our route into traffic intersections, bus stand, rest of the route, 
and overall route average. As expected, the RDD rates were found to be the highest at the TIs 
(Figure S5). For example, the mean RDD for coarse particles at the TIs during the morning 
runs (3.2±2.1 µg h–1) were about twice of those during the afternoon runs (5.1±2.9 µg h–1), 
demonstrating the dominance of coarse particles during the afternoon runs (significant, p-value 
<0.001). The similar trend was evident for bus stand during the morning (2.6±1.5 µg h–1) and 
afternoon (3.5±1.8 µg h–1) runs (significant, p-value <0.001). However, the mean RDD for fine 
particles showed a reverse trend, as was seen for the PMCs (Section 3.1), with 1.2±0.6 µg h–1 
and 1.0±0.6 µg h–1 at TIs (significant, p-value <0.001) and 1.3±1.0 µg h–1 and 1.2±0.9 µg h–1 
at the bus stands (not significantly different, p-value <0.269) during the morning and afternoon 
runs, respectively. An important finding is that in-pram babies experience relatively larger 
doses of fine particles during the morning while the doses are higher for coarse particles during

the afternoon runs. Fine particles show larger health impacts compared to their larger 
counterparts (Heal et al., 2012) and at the young age children are more susceptible to particulate 
pollution due to their immature system, higher inhalation rates and lower body weight 
(Heinrich and Slama 2007), suggesting a clear need for precautionary measures to limit their 
exposure during their transport along the busy roadsides. 
4. 
Conclusions  
Personal exposure of in-pram babies for both PMC and PNC were assessed along with 
the concurrent measurements of adult exposure to PM2.5. The objectives were to quantify the 
in-pram babies exposure of airborne particles when the parents drop-in and pick-up their 
children during morning and afternoon hours. The specific contribution of traffic intersections, 
bus stand was also studied. 
The following conclusions were drawn: 
 
PM2.5, PM1 and PNC concentrations were 47, 31 and 31% higher during the morning runs 
than those during the afternoon hours, reflecting the influence of traffic emissions during 
the morning peak hours. Conversely, coarse particles were 70% higher in the afternoons, 
indicating that re-suspension was importantly affected by the wetness of road pavement 
due to overnight dew in the early mornings. A similar trend was reflected by the fraction 
composition showing the proportion of coarse particles as 43% and 63% during morning 
and afternoon runs, respectively. 
 
TIs were hotspots of enhanced exposure for PM2.5-10 (19 and 10% higher during morning 
and afternoon, respectively), PM2.5 (7 and 10% higher) and PNC concentrations (68% and 
62% higher) compared with the rest of the route.  TI1 showed the highest PM2.5 and PNC 
concentrations since it was one of the busiest TIs on the route and the pollutant dispersion 
here may have been limited by the surrounding buildings. The section crossing the bus 
stand also showed higher concentrations for PM2.5 (12 and 21% higher during morning 
and afternoon, respectively) and for PNC (62 and 69%) compared with the rest of the route 
due to the fresh emissions of idling buses, but were lower for PM2.5-10 (5 and 25% lower 
during morning and afternoon, respectively).    
 
A comparative analysis between the babies and adults showed trivial differences in overall 
average PM2.5 concentrations. Our results showed 5% lower concentrations of PM2.5 for 
babies during morning drop-in hours as opposed to 10% higher concentrations during the 
afternoon pick-up hours compared with adults.  
 
A wide range of morphologies was observed under SEM, from exhaust agglomerates to 
mineral crustal forms and cloth fibres. Non-exhaust elements which are traces of brake 
abrasion were identified by means of EDS as well as mineral components from road dust 
re-suspension. Salting the roads might be an important source of NaCl. 
 
The RDD rates imitated the trend of PMC. A considerable variability was observed

between the hourly RDD estimated for female babies, which were between 1.2-11.6 µg h–
1 and 3.0-20.4 µg h–1 during the morning and afternoon runs, respectively.   
This study provides hitherto missing knowledge on the exposure of in-pram babies during the 
morning and afternoon pick-up periods of children from school. The findings clearly suggest 
much higher concentrations of fine PMC and PNC during the morning peak hours, especially 
on the traffic intersections and bus stand. While our exposure assessment and SEM/EDS 
analyses provided information on respiratory doses and various chemical species, further 
studies assessing the toxicity of particles in various size ranges are recommended to understand 
their impact on infant children.

Figure 8. Respiratory deposition doses of in-pram babies during (a, b) morning, and (c, d) 
afternoon up and down runs. Please note that each run presents two bars for up and down 
measurements of the route, respectively. Each run numbers presents a return trip between the 
origin and destination points. The runs #24 and #29 did not show data because of the rain 
during these run periods. Sub-figure (e) and (f) show the RDD of fine and coarse particles, 
inside the baby pram during the morning and afternoon runs, respectively; overall represents 
the average of morning and afternoon runs. The whiskers show the 5% and the 95% percentile 
whereas the average values are shown by the cross signs.
