IMPORTANCE Observational studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation is associated
with benefits for knee osteoarthritis, but current trial evidence is contradictory.
OBJECTIVE TocomparetheeffectsofvitaminDsupplementationvsplaceboonkneepainand
kneecartilagevolumeinpatientswithsymptomatickneeosteoarthritisandlowvitaminDlevels.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A multicenter randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled clinical trial in Tasmania and Victoria, Australia. Participants with
symptomatic knee osteoarthritis and low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (12.5-60 nmol/L) were
enrolled from June 2010 to December 2011. The trial was completed in December 2013.
INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomly assigned to receive monthly treatment with oral
vitamin D3 (50 000 IU; n = 209) or an identical placebo (n = 204) for 2 years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes were change in tibial cartilage volume
(assessed using magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and change in the Western Ontario and
McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain score (0 [no pain] to 500 [worst pain])
from baseline to month 24. Secondary outcomes were cartilage defects and bone marrow
lesions (assessed using MRI).
RESULTS Of 413 enrolled participants (mean age, 63.2 years; 50% women), 340 (82.3%)
completed the study. The level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D increased more in the vitamin D group
(40.6 nmol/L) than in the placebo group (6.7 nmol/L) (P < .001) over 2 years. There were no
significant differences in annual change of tibial cartilage volume or WOMAC pain score.
There were no significant differences in change of tibiofemoral cartilage defects or change in
tibiofemoral bone marrow lesions. Adverse events (�1 per patient) occurred in 56
participants in the vitamin D group and in 37 participants in the placebo group (P = .04).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis and
low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, vitamin D supplementation, compared with placebo,
did not result in significant differences in change in MRI-measured tibial cartilage volume or
WOMAC knee pain score over 2 years. These findings do not support the use of vitamin D
supplementation for preventing tibial cartilage loss or improving WOMAC knee pain in
patients with knee osteoarthritis.

S
ymptomatic knee osteoarthritis occurs among 10% of
men and 13% of women aged 60 years or older.1 World-
wide, knee osteoarthritis, together with hip osteoar-
thritis, are the 11th leading cause of global disability, account-
ing for 2.2% of total years lived with disability.2 Medical costs
of osteoarthritis account for 1% to 2.5% of the gross domestic
product in developed countries.3 Currently there are no
disease-modifying therapies for osteoarthritis; therefore,
there is a need to develop cost-effective approaches to pre-
vent the development and progression of osteoarthritis.
Vitamin D can reduce bone turnover and cartilage degra-
dation, thus potentially preventing the development and
progression of knee osteoarthritis.4,5 Epidemiological studies
showed that low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were
associated with greater knee pain,6,7 a higher prevalence of
radiographic knee osteoarthritis,8 and higher risk of pro-
gression.9,10 However, observational studies are subject to in-
herent bias and confounding factors such as physical activity
and sun exposure.11 In addition, 2 small existing randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) reported contradictory results.5,12 The
inconsistencies are likely because of variations in inclusion cri-
teria,outcomemeasures,follow-uptime,andsamplesize.13An
updated systematic review called for further larger well-
designed RCTs to determine whether vitamin D supplementa-
tion can slow disease progression.14 Therefore, we conducted
anRCTofparticipantswithclinicallyrelevantinclusioncriteria,13
to evaluate the effects of 2 years of vitamin D supplementation
vs placebo on knee pain and knee cartilage volume in patients
with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis combined with low
25-hydroxyvitaminDlevels.Effectsonotherkneestructuralab-
normalities, including cartilage defects and bone marrow le-
sions, were also assessed.
Methods
Trial Design
TheVitaminDEffectonOsteoarthritis(VIDEO)studywasaran-
domized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, which was
conducted between June 2010 and December 2013.15 Partici-
pants were recruited from June 2010 to December 2011 in
Tasmania and Victoria, Australia, through advertisements in
local media and community groups, as well as referrals from
general practitioners, rheumatologists, and orthopedic sur-
geons. A telephone prescreening was conducted to inquire
about knee pain status, comorbidities, participation in other
studies, and whether the survey recipient anticipated knee or
hip surgery within next 2 years. Potentially eligible partici-
pants were subsequently assessed during a clinic visit that in-
cluded a physical examination, knee radiography, and assess-
ment of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. The trial protocol
appears in Supplement 1.
Participants
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were described in the pub-
lished protocol.15 In brief, eligible participants were aged 50
to 79 years, had symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (assessed ac-
cording to American College of Rheumatology [ACR] criteria16)
foratleast6months,andhadpainof20to80mmona100-mm
visual analog scale. In addition, participants had an ACR func-
tion class rating of I, II, or III (I [complete ability to perform
usual activities of daily living] to III [ability to perform usual
self-care activities but limited in vocational and avocational
activities])andrelativelygoodhealthscoreof0to2ona5-point
Likert scale (0 [very good health] to 4 [very poor health]) ac-
cording to the investigator assessment of disease status. Par-
ticipants were included if their serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
levels were between 12.5 nmol/L and 60 nmol/L. Ethics ap-
proval was received from the Tasmania Health and Human
MedicalResearchEthicsCommittee(referencenumberH1040)
and Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee
(reference number CF10/1182-2010000616). Informed writ-
ten consent was obtained from all participants.
Exclusion criteria included grade 3 radiographic changes
according to the Altman and Gold atlas,17 severe knee pain on
standing (more than 80 mm on a 100-mm visual analog scale),
contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), rheu-
matoid or psoriatic arthritis, lupus, cancer, severe cardiac or
renal impairment, hypersensitivity to vitamin D, conditions af-
fecting oral drug absorption, anticipated knee or hip surgery
within the next 2 years, history of significant trauma of knees
(eg, arthroscopy or injury to ligaments or menisci <1 year pre-
ceding the study), and history of taking vitamin D or an inves-
tigational drug within the last 30 days.
The knee that met the previously described inclusion and
exclusion criteria was selected as the study knee for outcome
measures. When both knees met the criteria, the study knee
was defined as the one with worse pain assessed using the vi-
sual analog scale.
Randomization and Masking
Participants were allocated to either the vitamin D or placebo
group at a ratio of 1:1 based on computer-generated random
numbers. Allocation concealment was confirmed by a central
automated allocation procedure that was independent of the
investigators. Treatment assignment was masked from all par-
ticipants, research coordinators, and investigators and main-
taineduntilalldatawerecollected,confirmedforaccuracy,and
cleaned, and statistical analyses were performed.
Interventions
Participants in the treatment group were given a monthly cap-
sule of 50 000 IU (1.25 mg) of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) for
24 months (Nationwide Compounding Pharmacy).18 Partici-
pants in the control group received an identical inert placebo
provided by the same company.
Outcomes
Knee pain was added as an additional primary end point to the
protocol on June 6, 2012, after comments were received from
reviewers of the methods article.15 The secondary outcomes

In this article, only the primary outcomes and a subset of
secondary outcomes (as listed in the study protocol
[Supplement 1]) are reported. Primary outcome measures
were change in knee pain assessed using the Western
Ontario and McMaster University Index of osteoarthritis
(WOMAC) score19 and change in tibial cartilage volume on
MRI from baseline to month 24. There were 5 prespecified
secondary outcomes (cartilage defects; tibial plateau bone
area; subchondral bone marrow lesion; meniscal tear and
extrusion; and lower limb muscle strength), but only the
outcomes for cartilage defects and bone marrow lesions on
MRI are reported in this article. Post hoc analysis outcomes
include 20% and 50% improvement rates in WOMAC pain
score, WOMAC function and stiffness scores, visual analog
scale knee pain, and the responder criteria developed by the
Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Arthritis Clinical Trials-
Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OMERACT-
OARSI) criteria.
Assessment of Pain
Knee pain was assessed at baseline and at months 3, 6, 12, and
24. Five items of WOMAC pain scale in 100-mm visual analog
format were used to assess pain during walking, using stairs,
in bed, sitting or lying, and standing. Items were summed to
create a total pain score (range, 0-500).20 Knee pain in most
days of the previous month was assessed using a 100-mm vi-
sual analog scale.
Explanation of WOMAC Scoring
The total WOMAC score indicates the sum of subscale scores
including pain, stiffness, and physical function. Missing re-
sponses were managed according to the WOMAC user guide.21
TheWOMACpainscorewasconsideredvoidifmorethan1item
was missing. In the event of a missing item, the remaining 4
items were averaged and then multiplied by 5.
OMERACT-OARSI Responder Criteria
TheOARSIStandingCommitteeforClinicalTrialsResponseCri-
teriaInitiativedevelopedasetofrespondercriteria(OMERACT-
OARSI) to categorize individual response to treatment as a
single variable for clinical trials.22 Response using the exact
OMERACT-OARSI criteria could not be directly evaluated be-
cause patient global assessment was not recorded in this trial;
therefore, we used a modified OMERACT-OARSI responder
definition without patient global assessment. OMERACT-
OARSI responders in this study were defined as participants
with (1) at least 50% improvement and an absolute change of
at least 20 points in the mean WOMAC pain score or mean
WOMAC function score; or (2) at least 20% improvement and
an absolute change of at least 10 points in both the mean
WOMAC pain score and the mean WOMAC function score.
MRI Assessment of Knee Structural Changes
MRI scans of the study knee were obtained according to a stan-
dardized protocol using a 1.5 T whole-body MRI unit with a
commercial transmit-receive extremity coil. The sequences
used for cartilage volume assessment were sagittal fat satu-
rated (FS) T1-weighted spoiled gradient echo (GRE). Cartilage
defects and bone marrow lesions were assessed using
T2-weighted/proton density–weighted fast spin echo (FSE)
sequences. MRIs were assessed by trained readers blinded to
treatment allocation according to methods described
previously.15
Cartilage Volume | Cartilage volume was determined using the
previously described image processing techniques.8 The vol-
umes of individual cartilage plates (medial tibial and lateral
tibial) were isolated by manually drawing disarticulation con-
tours around the cartilage boundaries on a section-by-
section basis then resampled by means of bilinear and cubic
interpolationforfinal3-dimensionalrenderingusingOsiriXLite
imaging software (32-bit version 5.9, Pixmeo SARL). The co-
efficient of variation was 2.1% for medial tibia and 2.2% for lat-
eral tibia.23
Cartilage Defects | Cartilage defects (0-4) were graded on T2-
weighted images using a modified Outerbridge classification24
at medial tibial, medial femoral, lateral tibial, and lateral fem-
oral sites (described in the protocol).15 A total score was cal-
culated as the total of subregional scores. Intraobserver reli-
ability expressed as an intraclass correlation coefficient ranged
from 0.77 to 0.94.
Bone Marrow Lesions | Bone marrow lesions, defined as dis-
crete areas of increased signal adjacent to the subcortical bone,
were measured using a modified Whole-Organ Magnetic Reso-
nance Imaging Score (0 = none, 1 ≤ 25% of the subregion,
2 = 25%-50%, and 3 ≥ 50%).25 A total score of the tibiofemo-
ral compartment was calculated as the total of 13 subregional
scores (0-39). The intraclass correlation coefficient of this bone
marrow lesion ranged from 0.93 to 0.98.
25-Hydroxyvitamin D Assays
Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was assayed at screening, month
3, and month 24 using direct competitive chemiluminescent
immunoassays (DiaSorin Inc). The intraassay and interassay
coefficients of variation were 3.2% and 6.0%.
Sample Size
Quantification of cartilage volume loss has been used to
monitor the progression of knee osteoarthritis.26 Previous
studies reported that mean annual loss of medial tibial carti-
lage volume loss in patients with knee osteoarthritis was
4.5%.27 Monthly intake of 50 000 IU of vitamin D would
achieve serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels greater than
60 nmol/L28 and this change was estimated to lead to an
absolute reduction in medial tibial cartilage loss of 2.2%
annually,8 which was expected to translate into a risk reduc-
tion of 44% for total knee replacement over 4 years.29 Sample
size calculation assumed α = .05 and β = .20 and was per-
formed based on the Cohen formula.30 We calculated that
400 participants at baseline (200 in each group), allowing
20% for dropouts, would have at least 80% power to detect a
2.2% between-group difference in medial tibial cartilage loss.
For change in WOMAC pain, we anticipated a standard devia-
tion of 70.5 on a score from 0 to 500.12 With 400 partici-

pants, a difference between groups of 20 units on the score is
detectable with 80% power.
Statistical Analysis
WOMAC and visual analog scale knee pain scores were ana-
lyzed using a repeated-measures mixed model with terms for
age, sex, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms
divided by height in meters squared), treatment, month, and
trial center. The correlation within the repeated measures was
addressed by using an individual participant identification as
a random effect. The effect of treatment was evaluated by the
month × treatment interaction. In a post hoc analysis, the pro-
portion of participants who achieved at least 20% and 50% im-
provement in WOMAC pain score was evaluated, which has
been shown to be clinically relevant.31
The independent t test was used to compare annual
changes in cartilage volume and absolute changes of carti-
lage defects and bone marrow lesions between groups. An in-
crease in cartilage defects and bone marrow lesions was de-
fined as a change of more than 1 unit in score. Presence of an
increase in cartilage defects or bone marrow lesions was com-
pared between the 2 groups using logistic regression.
Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were
used. Per-protocol analysis was defined as achieving a
25-hydroxyvitamin D level of greater than 60 nmol/L at the
month 3 visit. Multiple imputation by chained equations was
used to address missing data caused by loss to follow-up and
nonresponses.Imputationswereperformedseparatelyforeach
treatment group and each outcome using baseline values, age,
sex, body mass index, and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level.
All statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 13.0
(Stata Corporation) and a 2-sided P value of .05 was consid-
ered statistically significant.
Results
Participants
Figure 1 shows the flow of study participants. A total of 599
participants were screened for eligibility from June 5, 2010,
to December 1, 2011, and 413 participants were randomly
assigned to receive either vitamin D (n = 209) or placebo
(n = 204). The mean age of participants was 63.2 years, 208
(50%) were women, and mean body mass index was 29.6.
Participants’demographic characteristics were comparable at
baseline between 2 groups (Table 1). Seventy-three partici-
pants withdrew from the study (28 [13.4%] in the vitamin D
group and 45 [22.1%] in the placebo group [P = .02]) and 340
participants (82.3%) completed the trial. There were no sig-
nificant differences between participants who completed the
study vs those who did not, except that among those who
withdrew, more were women and had lower tibial cartilage
volume (eTable in Supplement 2). Fewer participants discon-
tinued treatment in the vitamin D group (8) than the placebo

group (21). The major reason for a higher drop-out rate
in the placebo group was that participants had their
25-hydroxyvitamin D levels checked by a primary care physi-
cian and started taking vitamin D after finding low vitamin D
levels. Consequently, they were withdrawn from the study.
All available data from the randomized participants were
included in the intention-to-treat analyses.
Primary End Points
The mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level increased by
40.6 nmol/L in vitamin D group and by 6.7 nmol/L in placebo
group over 2 years. Overall, 165 (79%) participants in the vi-
tamin D group and 88 (43%) participants in the placebo group
reacheda25-hydroxyvitaminDlevelofgreaterthan60nmol/L
at month 3.
Changes in WOMAC knee pain are presented in Table 2. At
baseline,themean(SD)ofWOMACpainscoreswere137.9(88.8)
in the vitamin D group and 134.7 (83.4) in the placebo group
(difference, 3.2 [95% CI, −13.5 to 19.8]; P = .71). Total WOMAC
pain decreased over 24 months in both groups (Figure 2A). At
month 24, the mean (SD) of WOMAC pain scores were 87.0
(90.1) in the vitamin D group and 97.2 (87.5) in the placebo
group (difference, −10.2 [95% CI, −28.8 to 8.4]; P = .28). There
was no difference in change in WOMAC pain between groups
in the mixed-effect model in which all time points were in-
cluded (−49.9 for the vitamin D group vs −35.1 for the placebo
group; between-group difference, −14.8 [95% CI, −32.5 to 2.9];
P = .10).
Tibial cartilage volume (mean [SD]) at baseline was not
different between the vitamin D group (3466 mm3 [1038])
and the placebo group (3640 mm3 [1036]) (between-group
difference, −174 mm3 [95% CI of difference, −375 to 27];
P = .09). At month 24, tibial cartilage volume was also not
different between the vitamin D group (3238 mm3 [989])
and the placebo group (3398 mm3 [1030]) (between-group
difference, −160 mm3 [95% CI of difference, −369 to 49];
P = .13). Change in tibial cartilage volume (Table 2) was not
different between the groups (−242.6 mm3 for the vitamin D
group vs −301.4 mm3 for the placebo group [between-group
difference, 58.8 mm3 {95% CI, −13.9 to 131.4}]; P = .11). Per-
protocol analysis comparing participants who achieved a
25-hydroxyvitamin D level of greater than 60 nmol/L at their
month 3 visit (n = 253) with those who did not (n = 146) (14
participants withdrew within 3 months) showed similar
results (−261.9 mm3 vs −284.8 mm3 [between-group differ-
ence, 22.9 mm3 {95% CI, −51.5 to 97.3}]; P = .55).
Secondary End Points
The results for tibiofemoral cartilage defects and bone mar-
row lesions are shown in Table 2. The difference in cartilage
defect score was not different between groups. Bone marrow
lesion scores decreased in both groups and no significant dif-
ference was observed.
Post Hoc Analyses
In post hoc analyses (Table 2), participants in the vitamin D
group had statistically significant improvements in visual
analog scale knee pain (Figure 2E) scores when compared
with the placebo group. The vitamin D group had more
improvement in the total WOMAC score (Figure 2B) and
WOMAC function (Figure 2C) but not WOMAC stiffness
(Figure 2D). There were 115 (64%) participants in the vitamin
D group and 95 (57%) participants in the placebo group
(P = .16) who achieved a 20% improvement in WOMAC knee
pain score over 2 years. There were 90 (50%) participants in
the vitamin D group and 65 (39%) participants in the placebo
group (P = .04) who showed at least a 50% improvement in
WOMAC pain score. There were more OMERACT-OARSI
responders in the vitamin D group (74/209 [35%]) than the
placebo group (52/204 [25%]) (P = .03). The proportion of
participants who had an increase in bone marrow lesions
was lower in vitamin D group (44/183 [24%]) than in the pla-
cebo group (61/175 [35%]) (P = .03).
Adverse Events
Fifty six of the 209 participants (27%) in the vitamin D
group reported at least 1 adverse event vs 37 of the 204 par-
ticipants (18%) in the placebo group (Table 3). Four partici-
pants developed hypercalcemia in the vitamin D group vs 2
in the placebo group. One participant in the vitamin D group
had symptoms of hyperparathyroidism (eg, muscle cramps,

Discussion
The purpose of this RCT was to determine whether vitamin
D supplementation could reduce knee pain and cartilage
loss and also prevent progression of other knee structural
abnormalities in patients with knee osteoarthritis and low
25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Results showed that even
among study participants with low 25-hydroxyvitamin D,
supplementation did not slow cartilage loss or improve
WOMAC-assessed pain. These data suggest a lack of
evidence to support vitamin D supplementation for
slowing disease progression or structural change in knee
osteoarthritis.

Although epidemiological studies suggest that knee os-
teoarthritis is more prevalent among individuals who are de-
ficientinvitaminD,andvitaminDdeficiencyisassociatedwith
cartilage loss8-10 and knee osteoarthritis symptoms,6,7,32 the
results from 2 prior RCTs were mixed. In one study, supple-
mentation of vitamin D3 (2000 IU/day) over 2 years showed
no benefit for symptoms and structural changes in patients
withkneeosteoarthritis,regardlessoftheir25-hydroxyvitamin
D levels.5 The other study reported a small but statistically
significant benefit on symptoms in patients with vitamin D
insufficiency over 1 year.12 Both studies have limitations.
The first study included patients without vitamin D defi-
ciency who may not benefit from vitamin D supplementa-
tion and patients whose disease was too severe to respond
to vitamin D treatment. Also, it had a small sample size (146
participants).13 The second study did not examine structural
changes and had a 1-year follow-up, which may be too short
to observe disease progression.33 Our study addressed these
limitations by recruiting patients without severe knee
osteoarthritis with low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and pro-
vided follow-up for 2 years. Nonetheless, our results are
largely consistent with the prior 2 trials.
Structural changes in cartilage and noncartilaginous joint
tissue assessed using MRI, are now recommended outcomes
for clinical trials in osteoarthritis.34 An observational study
showed that lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were as-
sociated with greater cartilage volume loss over 2.7 years.8 In
the current study, the amount of tibial cartilage volume loss
in the placebo group is consistent with the findings of a pre-
vious RCT.5 We did not find significant effects on change in
knee cartilage defects and bone marrow lesions.
Adverse effects of vitamin D use may include hypercalce-
mia. Although intermittent use of very high-dose vitamin D
(eg,500 000IU/year)maynotbesafe,35ourstudysuggeststhat
a monthly regimen at a dosage of 50 000 IU is safe in elderly
patients, even though the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels
of long-term users are at the upper limit of the normal range.36
The key strength of this RCT is the inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria. This study included only adult patients with knee
osteoarthritiswhohadavitaminDinsufficiency—patientswho
may be the most likely to benefit from vitamin D supple-
ments. We also used a predefined range of knee pain to pre-
vent a ceiling or floor effect in the statistical analyses. Pa-
tients with late-stage knee osteoarthritis were excluded
because of very little cartilage remaining; thus, any possible
benefits of therapy on cartilage would be difficult to identify.
By using these criteria, we studied a patient population in
whom the likelihood of demonstrating an effect (if truly
present) of vitamin D supplementation was maximized.
This study also had limitations. First, WOMAC pain as a
second primary outcome was added during the recruitment
period at the time the protocol was published. However, this
change was made before the trial was completed, before any
data analyses, and the original sample size had sufficient
power to detect the expected difference in WOMAC pain.
Second, loss to follow-up was 17.7% and was less in the vita-
min D group (28 participants) than in the placebo group (45
participants) (P = .02). There were fewer participants who
withdrew from their assigned intervention in the vitamin D
group (n = 8) than in the placebo group (n = 21). Participants
who did not adhere to their assigned intervention could be
expected to have a worse outcome than those who did.
Although this could bias the result toward the null, similar
results were seen in per-protocol analysis, suggesting the dif-
ferential dropout rate had minimal effects on our results.
Last, this study did not prespecify clinical outcomes such as
visual analog scale knee pain and WOMAC physical function
as primary or secondary end points.
Conclusions
Among patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis and low
serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, vitamin D supplementa-
tion, when compared with placebo, did not result in signifi-
cantdifferencesinchangeinMRI-measuredtibialcartilagevol-
ume or change in WOMAC knee pain score over 2 years. These
findings do not support the use of vitamin D supplementa-
tion for preventing tibial cartilage loss or improving WOMAC
knee pain among patients with knee osteoarthritis.
