TGF-b Contributes to Impaired
Exercise Response by Suppression
of Mitochondrial Key Regulators
in Skeletal Muscle
Diabetes 2016;65:2849–2861 | DOI: 10.2337/db15-1723
A substantial number of people at risk of developing
type 2 diabetes could not improve insulin sensitivity by
physical training intervention. We studied the mechanisms
of this impaired exercise response in 20 middle-aged
individuals at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes who
performed 8 weeks of controlled cycling and walking
training at 80% individual VO2 peak. Participants iden-
tified as nonresponders in insulin sensitivity (based on
the Matsuda index) did not differ in preintervention pa-
rameters compared with high responders. The failure
to increase insulin sensitivity after training correlates
with impaired upregulation of mitochondrial fuel oxida-
tion genes in skeletal muscle, and with the suppression
of the upstream regulators PGC1a and AMPKa2. The
muscle transcriptomes of the nonresponders are further
characterized by the activation of transforming growth
factor (TGF)-b and TGF-b target genes, which is asso-
ciated with increases in inflammatory and macrophage
markers. TGF-b1 as inhibitor of mitochondrial regula-
tors and insulin signaling is validated in human skeletal
muscle cells. Activated TGF-b1 signaling downregulates
the abundance of PGC1a, AMPKa2, the mitochondrial
transcription factor TFAM, and mitochondrial enzymes.
Thus, the data suggest that increased TGF-b activity
in skeletal muscle can attenuate the improvement of
mitochondrial fuel oxidation after training and contribute
to the failure to increase insulin sensitivity.
Type 2 diabetes has become an epidemic, with more than
350 million affected people worldwide. The importance of
physical activity to prevent or ameliorate the diabetic met-
abolic state and its consequences is well accepted, and
regular exercise is recommended in both the prevention
and treatment of type 2 diabetes (1–3). When performed
regularly, it increases whole-body fat oxidation and insu-
lin sensitivity (4–6). However, evidence is accumulating
that differences exist in the individual response to exer-
cise training. On average, approximately 15–20% of peo-
ple failed to improve their glucose tolerance and insulin
sensitivity after exercise training interventions (7); this
nonresponse is not restricted to a specific type of exercise
(endurance or resistance training or combinations), al-
though differences are reported (8–11).
The molecular basis for this individual response to ex-
ercise intervention is unclear. Genome-wide linkage scans
performed in the HERITAGE family study underline the
importance of genetic factors for the individual response
of metabolic parameters to exercise (12,13). We hypothesize

METABOLISM
 that the individual response is related to specific tran-
scriptional signatures after training intervention that elu-
cidate the relevant changes in muscle gene expression
pattern that are linked to the improvement of insulin sen-
sitivity. Moreover, whole-genome expression signatures
can indicate the molecular mechanisms responsible for
the lack of improvement in metabolic parameters after
exercise training. To this end, we studied the training
intervention outcome of 20 individuals at high risk for
type 2 diabetes. We assessed insulin sensitivity using the
surrogate Matsuda insulin sensitivity index (ISI) (14), an-
thropometric and clinical parameters, and physical fitness
before and after 8 weeks of supervised endurance training.
Insulin sensitivity high responders (HREs) and nonre-
sponders (NREs) were determined based on the fold
change in insulin sensitivity before and after the inter-
vention. Whole-genome microarray analysis of skeletal
muscle biopsies obtained before and after training was
performed. These data suggested that enhanced trans-
forming growth factor (TGF)-b1 signaling can be a negative
regulator of exercise response, and this role was further
investigated in primary human skeletal muscle cells.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Study Participants and Phenotyping
Twenty middle-aged (mean 46.4 6 11.0 years; Supple-
mentary Table 1) and sedentary (,2 h habitual physical
activity per week; mean VO2peak (bike) 22.9 6 5.1 mL/min/kg;
Supplementary Table 1) individuals at high risk for type 2
diabetes were recruited. They met at least one of the
following inclusion criteria: BMI .27 kg/m2, family his-
tory (first-degree) of type 2 diabetes, or former gestational
diabetes. Severe diseases were excluded using routine lab-
oratory tests and physical examination. Insulin sensitivity
(ISI) before and after the intervention was determined
using a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test and calculated by
the method described by Matsuda and DeFronzo (14). Rou-
tine clinical chemical parameters were measured with
the ADVIA 1650 clinical chemical analyzer; insulin was
analyzed with the ADVIA Centaur immunoassay system
(both Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Fernwald, Germany).
Body fat mass and distribution were determined by mag-
netic resonance imaging (15). Informed written consent
was given by all individuals; the study protocol was ap-
proved by the ethics committee of the University of
Tübingen and was in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki.
Exercise Test and Training Intervention
Before and after the training period, all participants un-
derwent lactate diagnostics and maximal spiroergometry,
an incremental cycling test using an electromagneti-
cally braked bicycle ergometer (Excalibur Sport; Lode BV,
Groningen, the Netherlands), and an incremental walking
test on a motor-driven treadmill ergometer (Saturn 2.0 and
Pulsar 4.0; HP-Cosmos, Traunstein, Germany) to determine
individual lactate threshold (individual anaerobic threshold
[IAT]) and VO2peak (Table 1). The test was terminated at
volitional exhaustion or muscular fatigue. IAT was defined
according to Roecker et al. (16). Peak VO2 was defined
as the mean VO2 over the last 20 s before the cessation
of exercise and was assessed by metabolic gas analysis
(MetaLyzer 3B and MetaMax 3B; Cortex Biophysics GmbH,
Leipzig, Germany).
The training program lasted 8 weeks and consisted of
three supervised exercise sessions per week. Each training
session consisted of 30 min of bicycle ergometer exercise
and 30 min walking on a treadmill. The training intensity
was individually set at 80% of the VO2peak determined in
the performance test before the intervention and was not
changed throughout the training period. Training inten-
sity was controlled by heart rate and estimated as energy
expenditure (kilojoules per kilogram per minute) accord-
ing to Péronnet and Massicotte (17).
Muscle Biopsies and Microarray Analysis
Muscle biopsies were taken from the lateral portion of
the vastus lateralis of the quadriceps femoris after local
anesthesia (2% Scandicaine; AstraZeneca, Wedel, Ger-
many) before and after the training period, under sterile
conditions using a fine-needle punch biopsy technique
(Peter Pflugbeil GmBH, Zorneding, Germany). Snap-frozen
human muscle biopsies were homogenized using a
TissueLyser II (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Total RNA was
isolated, including DNase digestion, using the miRNeasy
Mini kit (Qiagen). The Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer was used
to assess RNA quality, and only high-quality RNA (RNA
integrity number .7) was used for microarray analysis.
Total RNA (30 ng) was amplified using the Ovation Pico
WTA System V2 in combination with the Encore Biotin
Module (Nugen). Amplified cDNA was hybridized on
Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 (Affymetrix,
Santa Clara, CA). Staining and scanning were done accord-
ing to the Affymetrix protocol, including minor modifica-
tions as suggested in the Encore Biotin protocol. RNA
was not available of one subject of the NRE group. One
sample (from the HRE group) was excluded from the
analysis because of low-quality data. Array data have
been submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus
(GSE72462).
Materials and Reagents
Recombinant TGF-b1 protein, and TGF-b1 and platelet fac-
tor 4 (PF4) ELISAs, were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis,
MN), TGF-b–inducible protein (TGFBI) ELISA was from
Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Cell culture media and supplements
were from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland); chicken embryo extract
was from Seralab (West Sussex, UK). Antibodies against
ATP5A (ab110273) and GAPDH (ab8245) were from

nology (Lake Placid, NY); against phospho-Ser-473 and
phospho-Thr-308 of Akt (9271 and 9275) and RPS6
(2217), from Cell Signaling Technology (Frankfurt, Germany);
and against Akt (610861), from BD Biosciences (Heidelberg,
Germany).

 Human Skeletal Muscle Cell Experiments
Skeletal muscle cells were obtained from six randomly
selected donors, including four participants of the current
study. Cells were grown from satellite cells obtained from
percutaneous needle biopsies performed on the lateral por-
tion of the quadriceps femoris (vastus lateralis) muscle.
The donors gave informed written consent to the study.
The Ethical Committee of the Tübingen University Med-
ical Department approved the protocol. CD56-positive
myoblasts were isolated using MACS microbeads (Milteny
Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and grown on six-
well plates coated with Geltrex (Life Technologies, Frank-
furt, Germany) in a 1:1 mixture of a-minimum essential
medium and Ham’s F-12 supplemented with 20% FBS, 1%
chicken extract, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL strepto-
mycin, and 0.5 mg/mL amphotericin B until 70–80% con-
fluence. TGF-b1 treatment was started at day 1 (for 7 days)
or day 4 (for 3 days) of fusion; cells were fused in a-minimum
essential medium containing 5.5 mmol/L glucose with 2%
FBS, 2 mmol/L glutamine, 125 mmol/L palmitate, 125
mmol/L oleate, 100 mmol/L L-carnitine, 100 U/mL penicillin,
100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 0.5 mg/mL amphotericin B.
RNA and proteins were isolated using the NucleoSpin miRNA
Kit (Macherey Nagel, Düren, Germany).
Quantitative PCR Analysis
RNA was transcribed by RT-PCR, with random hexamer
and oligo-dT primers mixed using the Transcriptor First
Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).
Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed on a
Roche Lightcycler 480 using QuantiTect Primer Assays
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) (Table 2).
Western Blotting
Protein concentration was quantified with the protein
quantification assay (Macherey Nagel, Düren, Germany).
Proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate poly-
acrylamide (7.5–15%) gradient gel electrophoresis and
were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by semi-
dry electroblotting. Immunodetection was performed as
recently described (18).
Immunostaining
Cells grown on cover slips were washed with PBS, fixed in
PBS containing 4% formaldehyde (pH 7.4) for 20 min,
quenched with 150 mmol/L glycine in PBS for 10 min,
and treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min. Blocking
was performed in 1% normal goat serum, 0.05% Tween
20 in PBS for 30 min. Cover slips were incubated with
antibodies recognizing CD56 (5.1H11; Developmental
Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA), major histocom-
patibility complex–fast (M4276), or major histocompati-
bility complex–slow (M8421; Sigma-Aldrich, Deisenhofen,
Germany) diluted 1:100 in blocking solution for 1 h at
room temperature, washed three times in PBS, and in-
cubated with the Alexa 488–labeled secondary antibody
(Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) diluted 1:250 in block-
ing solution for another 2 h and washed again. Nuclei
were stained using TO-PRO3 (Invitrogen) before mount-
ing in PermaFluor (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany).
ELISA
TGF-b1 and TGFBI were determined in plasma samples
obtained by ELISA after an overnight fast. To correct
for acute platelet activation during sample preparation,
platelet factor 4 (PF4/CXCL4) was measured in parallel
(19).
Statistical Analysis
For clinical data, statistical analysis was done using JMP11
(SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). If not stated otherwise, a
two-sided homoscedastic t test was performed. For time 3
group interaction, multivariate ANOVA was performed. A
P value ,0.05 was considered statistically significant. For
some variables, participants had to be excluded because
of incomplete data sets (before/after the intervention);
if so, the number of analyzed participants was stated.
If outliers were detected (using Grubbs’ test [maximum
normed residual test]; available from http://graphpad
.com/quickcalcs/grubbs1/), the number of individuals in-
cluded was stated. Differential gene regulation between
HRE and NRE samples was done by applying the limma t test
on log2 ratios (after intervention vs. before intervention; P ,
0.05). To reduce background signals, data were filtered for
linear arbitrary expression .8 in at least half of the samples.
The microarray data set was analyzed by the statistical pro-
gramming environment R implemented in CARMAweb (20)
developed for microarray data analysis. Gene-wise testing for
differential abundance at baseline or after the intervention
between ISI HREs and NREs was done by the paired limma
t test and Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction
(false discovery rate ,10%; average abundance .8 in at least
one group). Enriched KEGG pathways and gene ontology
(GO) terms were identified using InCroMAP (21). Upstream

RESULTS
Individual Response to Exercise Training
After 8 weeks of supervised training, the entire middle-aged
study group achieved an increase in the IAT and oxygen
uptake (VO2peak [bike]), and a decrease in BMI, total adi-
pose tissue, blood pressure, resting heart rate, plasma
triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol (Supplementary Table 1).
Insulin sensitivity (ISI) did not increase significantly among
the entire study group (8.3 6 6.4 vs. 9.5 6 7.8; P = 0.1),
with a high variability in the change of ISI, ranging from
2.7-fold to 0.6-fold after the intervention. Two groups
with the largest difference in the fold change of ISI
(8 HREs and 8 NREs) were each stratified by the two
outermost quintiles (Table 1). In the following, the terms
high responder and nonresponder are used according to the
different response in ISI, although NREs showed changes
in other parameters after the intervention (Table 1). The
HRE group had an average 1.6-fold increase in ISI, whereas
the NRE group had even a small decrease of ISI (0.9-fold)
after the exercise intervention (Supplementary Fig. 1). A
significant interaction of response group and interven-
tion was found for ISI, glucose (measured at 120 min),
and plasma triglycerides (Table 1, P1 value). IAT was
increased similarly in both groups (Table 1). Preinterven-
tion parameters—for example, insulin sensitivity, fit-
ness, and age—were not different between the groups
(Table 1, P2 value), and both groups trained with the
same intensity (HRE vs. NRE: cycling, 0.33 6 0.11 vs.
0.31 6 0.09 kJ/kg/min [P = 0.8]; treadmill, 0.39 6 0.10
vs. 0.35 6 0.06 kJ/kg/min [P = 0.5]).
Impaired Upregulation of Mitochondrial Energy
Metabolism Genes in ISI NREs
Transcriptome analyses of the muscle biopsies from the
HRE and NRE groups taken before and after the 8-week
training intervention revealed the differential regulation
of 469 genes after training (P , 0.05; ratio of fold changes,
.1.2 times). Significantly enriched GO terms were dom-
inated by cellular functions and components related to
mitochondria and metabolic pathways located in the mi-
tochondrial matrix, in particular fatty acid b-oxidation,
tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and
respiratory electron transport chain (Fig. 1A). The tran-
scripts of these mitochondrial enzymes and carriers located
in the inner mitochondrial membrane showed impaired
upregulation in the NRE group compared with the HRE
group, for example, the b-oxidation enzymes carnitine
palmitoyltransferase (CPT1B) and hydroxyacyl-CoA dehy-
drogenases (HADH) and ATP synthase (ATP5). Similarly,
GLUT4 (SLC2A4) and enzymes of glucose catabolism were
not upregulated in the NRE group compared with the HRE
group (Fig. 1A), suggesting not only impaired improvement
of fatty acid oxidation capacity and ATP production after the
intervention in NRE but also reduced upregulation of glu-
cose uptake and oxidation. Before the intervention, the
abundance of these transcripts was not different between
HREs and NREs, except for CPT1B (0.82-fold lower in NREs;
P = 0.03).
Ingenuity software was used to search for upstream
regulators that could explain the differences in gene reg-
ulation between NREs and HREs. The data indicate im-
paired activation of several regulators of exercise-dependent
gene expression in the skeletal muscle of NREs, namely
peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor g coactivator
PGC1a (gene name PPARGC1), peroxisome proliferator–
activated receptor transcription factors, estrogen recep-
tors (ESRRA, ESR), and an AMPKa2 subunit (gene name
PRKAA2) (Fig. 1B). PPARGC1A transcript abundance was
slightly increased in the HRE group after training but re-
duced in the NRE group (Fig. 1C). The NRE group also showed
a reduced abundance of PRKAA2 after the intervention (Fig.
1C). The fold change in transcripts of PPARGC1 and PRKAA2
correlated with the fold change in insulin sensitivity in the
entire study group (Fig. 1D and E). Abundance of transcripts
was also quantified by qPCR and gave comparable results
(Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Protein abundance of
AMPKa2 and of the ATP synthase subunit a (ATP5A) was
significantly increased in the HRE group, whereas the increase
was attenuated in the NRE group (Fig. 1F–H).
Increased Upregulation of Immune Response
and Inflammatory Genes and TGF-b Target Genes
in ISI NREs
In addition, GO terms related to immune response, in-
flammatory processes, and Toll-like receptor signaling
were significantly enriched among differentially regulated
genes in the HRE/NRE comparison. These differentially
regulated transcripts were upregulated in the NRE group
after the intervention and unchanged or even reduced in
the HRE group (Fig. 2A and B). The transcripts are known
to be highly expressed in macrophages (CD68, CXCR2,
CD14, TLR4) and neutrophils (CD97, CYBB, NCF1), or to
act as chemoattractants (RARRES2). The data suggest in-
creased infiltration of macrophages and neutrophiles and
enhanced inflammation in skeletal muscle of NREs after
the intervention, since no difference in the abundance of
transcripts was found before the intervention when com-
paring HREs versus NREs (P , 0.05; ratio, .1.2-fold).
Candidate upstream regulators specifically activated
in the NRE group are mitogen-activated protein kinases,
inflammatory cytokines, and TGF-b1 (gene name TGFB1)
(Fig. 2C). Several TGF-b1 target genes were upregulated
after the intervention and showed a negative correlation
with the change in insulin sensitivity in the entire group:
TGF-b-inducible protein TGFBI, collagens, and matrix
metallopeptidases (Fig. 2D–F and Supplementary Fig. 2A–C).
TGF-b1 itself was the only upstream candidate with a
differential transcript abundance after the intervention;
the NRE group showed slightly increased TGFB1 abundance
compared with the HRE group (1.25-fold; P , 0.05).

TGF-b and Mitochondrial Adaptation to Exercise
Diabetes Volume 65, October 2016
 Moreover, increased upregulation of the TGF-b receptor
2 was associated with ISI nonresponse (Fig. 2G). These
data point to an activation of TGF-b signaling in the muscle
of NREs, resulting in altered regulation of TGF-b target
genes. Plasma TGF-b1, also after relation to PF4, and
TGF-b-inducible protein levels were not changed after
training and were not different between the HRE and
NRE groups (Fig. 2H–J). Thus it is possible that the dif-
ferent activation of TGF-b signaling is restricted to the
skeletal muscle of HREs and NREs.
TGF-b1 Suppresses Mitochondrial Regulators
and Enzymes in Human Skeletal Muscle
TGF-b1 activity is not only dependent on its protein
abundance; after secretion, the bioavailability of the active
protein is regulated at multiple steps. The increase in the
expression of the TGF-b1-inducible protein TGFBI showed
a strong correlation with the upregulation of other TGF-b1
target genes in the muscle biopsies, as shown for FN1 and
COL1A2 (Supplementary Fig. 2D and E), and thus behaves
as a good readout of active TGF-b1 in skeletal muscle.
Notably, the increased expression of the TGF-b1-inducible
protein TGFBI correlated inversely with the downregula-
tion of PPARGC1A and PRKAA2 (Fig. 3A and B). Thus
the muscle transcriptome data suggest a negative regula-
tion of PPARGC1A and PRKAA2 expression by TGF-b1.
We tested this hypothesis in human skeletal muscle
cells. When differentiated myotubes were incubated with
TGF-b1 for 24 h, we found a significant decrease in
mRNA abundance in PPARGC1A, PRKAA2, the mitochon-
drial transcription factor TFAM, and key regulators of
b-oxidation, HADHA and CPT1B (Fig. 3C–G). This de-
crease was prevented by cotreatment with the TGF-b re-
ceptor 1 antagonist SB431542. Treatment with SB431542
alone increased the expression of PPARGC1A and CPT1B.
This effect can be a result of the inhibition of autocrine
TGF-b1 activity, which is also visible as reduced expres-
sion of the TGF-b1 target gene TGFBI in the presence of
SB431542 (Fig. 3H). TGF-b1 treatment of myotubes had
also an inhibitory effect on insulin signaling since it re-
duced insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt/protein
kinase B (Fig. 3I–K). When the cells were treated with
TGF-b1 for 3 or 7 days, a marked downregulation of
PPARGC1A was observed, whereas treatment with the
TGF-b receptor 1 antagonist SB431542 alone increased
the expression approximately fivefold (Fig. 4A). TGF-b1-
induced inhibition was also found for PRKAA2, TFAM,
HADHA, and CPT1B expression, with an opposite effect of
the antagonist SB431542 (Fig. 4B–E). Moreover, TGF-b1
reduced the protein abundance of both AMPKa2 and
ATP5A (Fig. 4F–H). TGF-b1 treatment also blocked the
increase in mRNA abundance of MYH2 and MYH7 and
muscle cell differentiation (Fig. 4I–K). Notably, cells ob-
tained from donors identified as ISI HREs and NREs did
not differ in their response to TGF-b1 (Supplementary
Fig. 3). To conclude, these data indicate that TGF-b1
downregulates the abundance of mitochondrial regulators
and mitochondrial enzymes in skeletal muscle cells. This
inhibitory effect is found in differentiated myotubes and
during cell differentiation.
DISCUSSION
In this study we provide evidence for a molecular mecha-
nism that can contribute to the failure to improve insulin
sensitivity after an exercise intervention. Given the enor-
mous relevance of physical activity in the prevention and
therapy of type 2 diabetes, and a notable number of in-
dividuals who showed no beneficial effects of training on
metabolic parameters (7), it is important to understand
the molecular basis of this exercise nonresponse.
All subjects in our study improved their IAT, but they
showed a huge variability in their fold change in insulin
sensitivity after the eight weeks of supervised endurance
training. We clearly defined a group of responders that
could increase their insulin sensitivity after the training
intervention and a group of NREs. Using whole-genome
microarray analyses of the muscle biopsies taken before
and after the intervention, we gained unbiased insight
into the training-induced molecular changes in muscle of
the responders and NREs.
We identified specific transcriptional profiles in the
muscle of the NRE group and provide evidence from cell
culture studies for a role of TGF-b1 as one negative regu-
lator of mitochondrial activators and enzymes potentially
preventing a beneficial metabolic adaptation to training.
The NREs showed increased expression of TGF-b1, of the
receptor TGFBR2, and of several target genes of TGF-b.
Notably, the transcripts that indicate higher TGF-b activity
were not different before the intervention. Thus this dif-
ferent transcriptional profile is caused by a different re-
sponse to training.
In addition, the failure to improve insulin sensitivity is
associated with impaired upregulation of genes that are
important for glucose and fatty acid oxidation and mito-
chondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The transcriptional
coactivator PGC1a and AMPK were identified as relevant
upstream regulators that are implicated in this exercise
nonresponse. Importantly, the mRNA abundance of genes
encoding for PGC1a and AMPKa2 was downregulated in
fold changes in transcripts (n = 18). F–H: Immunoblots of protein lysates of muscle biopsies using indicated antibodies. Detection of
GAPDH serves as the loading control for separate blots. Relative band intensity values normalized to GAPDH are shown (n = 4–7, mean 6

detectable ATP5a or AMPKa2 signal; hence it was excluded from quantification.

 the muscle of NREs after the intervention. We proved a
causal relationship of the increased TGF-b1 activity and
the suppression of PGC1a and AMPKa2 in human skel-
etal muscle cells. TGF-b1 downregulated and blockade
of TGF-b signaling upregulated the expression of PGC1a
and AMPKa2, and consequently of the mitochondrial tran-
scription factor TFAM, which is regulated by PGC1a (22).
Moreover, TGF-b1 downregulated key regulators of mito-
chondrial fatty acid oxidation—what is likely to be a con-
sequence of the negative effect on PGC1a and AMPK. Both
proteins are key players in the exercise-dependent regula-
tion of enzymes involved in fuel oxidation (23). Thus the
cell culture data provide clear evidence for the molecular
mechanism suggested by the transcriptome analyses of the
muscles of responders and NREs.
On a molecular level, activation of TGF-b1 signaling
leads to phosphorylation of SMAD3, which can act as a
transcriptional repressor at the PGC1a promoter (24).
The importance of the TGF-b/SMAD3 pathway for met-
abolic control in humans is suggested by a close associa-
tion of BMI and circulating TGF-b1 levels (25), and the
association of elevated plasma TGF-b1 and higher risk for
type 2 diabetes (26). A rat model with insulin resistance
and a low aerobic response to exercise shows increased
activation of SMAD3-dependent gene expression after an
acute exercise bout when compared with rats with a high
aerobic response (27). Although the causal relationship
needs to be proven in vivo, these data point to chronically
elevated TGF-b1 activity as a negative regulator in the
adaptation of fuel oxidation in response to training, dem-
onstrated for the first time in a human exercise interven-
tion study. The TGF-b-mediated inhibition of skeletal
muscle differentiation, as shown in the human muscle cells
in our study and described earlier (28), can play an addi-
tional role here.
While all participants in our study were untrained and
overweight, only some of them showed an adverse response
to the training intervention. The increased expression of
markers of macrophages, neutrophils, and inflammation
suggests local inflammatory processes in the muscle of
these NREs, even though increased recruitment of im-
mune cells was not investigated by immunohistochem-
istry in our study. Activated resident macrophages and
infiltrated immune cells release TGF-b, which is a physio-
logical response of the skeletal muscle to mechanical load-
ing and is involved in the synthesis and reorganization of
extracellular matrix components (29). The recruitment of
macrophages and neutrophils is often associated with acute
eccentric or resistance exercise (30), but it can also occur
after endurance exercise (31). TGF-b then activates fibroblasts
in the muscle to produce extracellular matrix proteins and
TGF-b itself (32), while muscle satellite cells and myofibers
may contribute to the enhanced production of TGF-b and
extracellular matrix proteins (33,34). This process possi-
bly took place in all participants of our study after the
first training sessions, as part of the normal regeneration
program of an untrained muscle (32,35). Since the train-
ing intensity was comparable between the HRE and NRE
groups, higher intensity cannot explain the increased ex-
pression of inflammatory markers and TGF-b target genes
in the muscle of NREs. It is more likely that the adapta-
tion process after the unaccustomed physical activity is
different. This indicates the importance of carefully
designed, individualized training protocols for physically
inactive subjects to avoid the possible consequences of
unaccustomed skeletal muscle activity. On the other hand,
we cannot rule out the possibility that the duration or in-
tensity of our training protocol was not conducive for the
metabolic improvement of some of our study participants.
Extension of the training period with reduced exercise in-
tensity or a combination of high-intensity training and re-
sistance training might be a way to overcome the lack of
metabolic improvement. A limitation of our study is the
self-determined order of the exercise type (walking/cycling)
in each training session. The order was not recorded and
might have influenced the training outcome. Moreover, we
do not know whether the muscle used for the biopsies was
similarly recruited during walking and cycling in all subjects.
Clearly, increased TGF-b activity is only one potential
contributor to the individual exercise response. An inter-
esting upstream regulator candidate with a high activa-
tion score in the NRE group compared with HRE group,
which we did not further investigate in this study, is the
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase
4 (MAP4K4). MAP4K4 deficiency in skeletal muscle of
mice improves insulin sensitivity and protects from obesity-
induced insulin resistance (36), and genetic polymorphisms
in the MAP4K4 locus have been associated with insulin
resistance (37). Thus activation of this kinase in skeletal
muscle may be another regulator of the individual differ-
ences in the metabolic response to training interventions.
Our data underline the importance of PGC1a for the
beneficial effects of exercise on metabolic control. PGC1a
is considered as an important upstream regulator of
training-induced metabolic adaptations because of its po-
tency to activate mitochondrial biogenesis and the forma-
tion of oxidative muscle fibers (22,38,39). In addition, genetic
variations in the PPARGC1A gene were associated with the
change in insulin sensitivity and fitness after a 9-month life-
style intervention (40). Our results are also well in accordance
with a recent study that showed that only individuals who
achieved normalized glucose tolerance after exercise training
the plasma concentration of PF4 (I), and TGFBI (J) in HRE samples (n = 8) and NRE samples (n = 8) before (pre) and after (post) 8 weeks
of training intervention. Individual concentrations are shown as black dots. The bar graphs identify the mean 6 SD of each group.

while expression levels remained unaltered in individuals
who could not improve their glucose control. Although the

 intervention vs. a 2 months of supervised endurance train-
ing), the responders in that study and our HRE group show
very similar changes in the expression of metabolic and
mitochondrial markers in skeletal muscle.
In conclusion, our data suggest a causal relationship of
enhanced TGF-b1 activity in skeletal muscle after training and
the suppression of key mitochondrial regulators. The results
can contribute to our understanding of the failure of the
skeletal muscle to participate in the improvement of insulin
sensitivity after exercise intervention. Since skeletal muscle
accounts for approximately 30–40% of total body weight in
nonobese humans and for more than 85% of insulin-
dependent glucose uptake (42), this tissue plays a major
role in whole-body metabolic control. Our data underline
the importance of personalized training strategies and can,
for the first time, open perspectives to target exercise non-
response by the prevention of dysregulated TGF-b1 signal-
ing in skeletal muscle.
