IMPORTANCE The degree to which patients are empowered by written educational materials
depends on the text’
s readability level and the accuracy of the information provided. The
association of a website’
s affiliation or focus on treatment modality with its readability and
accuracy has yet to be thoroughly elucidated.
OBJECTIVE To compare the readability and accuracy of patient-oriented online resources for
pancreatic cancer by treatment modality and website affiliation.
DESIGN An online search of 50 websites discussing 5 pancreatic cancer treatment modalities
(alternative therapy, chemotherapy, clinical trials, radiation therapy, and surgery) was
conducted. The website’
s affiliation was identified. Readability was measured by 9
standardized tests, and accuracy was assessed by an expert panel.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Nine standardized tests were used to compute the median
readability level of each website. The median readability scores were compared among
treatment modality and affiliation categories. Accuracy was determined by an expert panel
consisting of 2 medical specialists and 2 surgical specialists. The 4 raters independently
evaluated all websites belonging to the 5 treatment modalities (a score of 1 indicates that
<25% of the information is accurate, a score of 2 indicates that 26%-50% of the information
is accurate, a score of 3 indicates that 51%-75% of the information is accurate, a score of 4
indicates that 76%-99% of the information is accurate, and a score of 5 indicates that 100%
of the information is accurate).
RESULTS The 50 evaluated websites differed in readability and accuracy based on the focus
of the treatment modality and the website’
s affiliation. Websites discussing surgery (with a
median readability level of 13.7 and an interquartile range [IQR] of 11.9-15.6) were easier to
read than those discussing radiotherapy (median readability level, 15.2 [IQR, 13.0-17.0])
(P = .003) and clinical trials (median readability level, 15.2 [IQR, 12.8-17.0]) (P = .002).
Websites of nonprofit organizations (median readability level, 12.9 [IQR, 11.2-15.0]) were
easier to read than media (median readability level, 16.0 [IQR, 13.4-17.0]) (P < .001) and
academic (median readability level, 14.8 [IQR, 12.9-17.0]) (P < .001) websites. Privately owned
websites (median readability level, 14.0 [IQR, 12.1-16.1]) were easier to read than media
websites (P = .001). Among treatment modalities, alternative therapy websites exhibited the
lowest accuracy scores (median accuracy score, 2 [IQR, 1-4]) (P < .001). Nonprofit (median
accuracy score, 4 [IQR, 4-5]), government (median accuracy score, 5 [IQR, 4-5]), and
academic (median accuracy score, 4 [IQR, 3.5-5]) websites were more accurate than privately
owned (median accuracy score, 3.5 [IQR, 1.5-4]) and media (median accuracy score, 4 [IQR,
2-4]) websites (P < .004). Websites with higher accuracy were more difficult to read than
websites with lower accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Online information on pancreatic cancer overestimates the
reading ability of the overall population and lacks accurate information about alternative
therapy. In the absence of quality control on the Internet, physicians should provide guidance
to patients in the selection of online resources with readable and accurate information.

P
atientsincreasinglyusetheInternettolearnmoreabout
diseases and treatment options.1-4 Online medical in-
formation is accessible and relatively inexpensive and
empowers patients to make decisions.5,6 It is often used in lieu
of formal medical consultations, particularly among patients
with financial limitations.4,7-9 However, online materials may
be too difficult for the average patient to comprehend.1,6 Fur-
thermore, the accuracy of online information can vary widely.
Online information may be biased, motivated by underlying
commercialinterests,takenoutofcontext,orincomplete.This
has the potential to lead to unfavorable downstream effects.
Particularly for complex and aggressive diseases such as pan-
creatic cancer, misinformation or perceptions of dismal out-
comes can hinder patients from seeking appropriate care.10
Compounding this problem is the fact that reading mate-
rials are rarely written at the recommended sixth-grade read-
ing level.11-15 A patient’
s health literacy or ability to compre-
hend written health information can impact clinical outcomes.
Elderly patients with low health literacy are at greater risk of
all-cause mortality.16 Patients with low health literacy and ad-
vancedcolorectalcancerarealsolesslikelytoreceivestandard-

It has been reported that patients believe searching the In-
ternet empowers them to make decisions about their
health.4,7,18-20 However, it has been found that online informa-

various treatment options for pancreatic cancer.
Methods
Data Collection
This study was approved by the institutional review board at
the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center in Boston, Massachu-
setts. Online searches using Google, the search engine most
commonly used in the United States and throughout the
world,21 were limited to 1 location (the United States) and 1 lan-
guage(English).DatawerecollectedduringMay2014usingthe
following search terms, which are also the 5 treatment mo-
dalities: (1) pancreas cancer alternative therapies, (2) pancreas
cancerchemotherapy,(3)pancreascancerclinicaltrials,(4)pan-
creascancerradiotherapy,and(5)pancreascancersurgery.Web-
sites had to meet the following eligibility criteria: they were
designed for public consumption and not for health care pro-
fessionals; they were specific to pancreatic cancer treatment,
at least 100 words in length, and written in English. Websites
meeting the following criteria were excluded: general news-
paper reports that did not discuss treatment information, ac-
cessrestrictedbysubscriptionsorfees,duplicatewebsites,and
websites presenting videos only. Websites were classified into
5 affiliation categories using the following method: (1) web-
sites with “.org” domains that were not affiliated with aca-
demic hospitals were treated as nonprofit organizations; (2)
websites with “.edu” domains were treated as academic web-
sites; (3) websites with “.gov” domains were treated as gov-
ernment websites; (4) websites with news portals were treated
as communication media websites; and (5) websites that did
not disclose affiliation or that disclosed affiliation to a private
holder were treated as private. Affiliation was confirmed by
use of the WHOis.net database.22
Analysis and Definition of Terms
The first 10 eligible websites appearing for each treatment cat-
egorywereanalyzedforaccuracyandreadability.Accuracywas

not evaluated in this study.
Assessment of Readability
Readability was analyzed using the Readability Studio Profes-

The 9 tests were used to compute the median readability level
of each website. The median readability scores were compared
among treatment modality and affiliation categories. Table 1

Key Points
Question Are there differences in the accuracy and readability of
online resources discussing pancreatic cancer?
Findings In this study of 50 websites on pancreatic cancer
treatment options, all of the websites overestimated the reading
ability of the intended population. Most of the websites, except for
those discussing alternative therapies for pancreatic cancer, were
accurate. Nonprofit, academic, and government websites
presented more accurate information than media and privately
owned websites.
Meaning Physician guidance is critical in the selection of
appropriate online resources to empower patients’decision
making through receipt of readable and accurate information.

Statistical Analysis
Data were treated as nonparametric. Readability level was
treated as a continuous variable and analyzed by use of the
Kruskal-Wallis test. Accuracy level was treated as an ordinal
variable and analyzed with the Kruskal-Wallis test. Pairwise

significance set at P ≤ .005. Small Stata 13 software (Stata-
Corp) was used for all analysis.
Results
Readability and Treatment Modality
All5treatmentmodalitieshadmedianreadabilitylevelshigher
than the recommended sixth-grade reading level. Readabil-
ity level ranged widely between 3.8 and 19.0 (Table 2). The me-
dian readability level was statistically different among the 5
treatment modalities (14.2 for alternative therapies, 14.5 for
chemotherapy,15.2forclinicaltrialsandradiotherapy,and13.7
for surgery [P = .03]). Websites discussing surgery (with a me-
dian readability level of 13.7 and an interquartile range [IQR]
of 11.9-15.6) were easier to read than websites discussing clini-
cal trials (median readability level, 15.2 [IQR, 12.8-17.0])
(P = .002)andradiotherapy(medianreadabilitylevel,15.2[IQR,
13.0-17.0]) (P = .003) (Table 2). No statistically significant dif-
ferences were found among other categories.
Accuracy and Treatment Modality
Interrater correlation for absolute agreement was 0.836 (95%
CI, 0.746-0.899). Median accuracy scores ranged between 2
and 5, and were statistically different among treatment groups
(P < .001) (Table 3). Websites on alternative therapies had the
lowest accuracy (median accuracy score, 2 [IQR, 1-4]), reach-
ing statistical significance when compared with websites on
chemotherapy (median accuracy score, 4 [IQR, 3-5]) (P < .001),
clinical trials (median accuracy score, 5 [IQR, 4-5]) (P < .001),
and radiotherapy (median accuracy score, 4 [IQR, 4-5])
(P < .001). Websites on clinical trials were found to be more ac-
curate than websites on chemotherapy (P = .003) and sur-
gery (median accuracy score, 4 [IQR, 3-4]) (P < .001). A sensi-

tivity analysis weighting the 2 surgeons’accuracy ratings was
performed owing to concerns of bias when rating websites of
different modalities. Reported findings remained significant
(P < .001).
Accordingtotheraters’observationsaccruedviathemeth-
ods already described, there were concerns about websites by
treatment modality. Several alternative therapy websites de-
scribed topics using anecdotes and suggested therapies and
imaging techniques that were not standard practice as if they
were standard practice. Several radiotherapy and chemo-
therapy websites contained inaccuracies in their descrip-
tions of the risks and adverse effects of therapy. Several ra-
diotherapy websites omitted information considered by the
experts to be fundamental to the description of the treat-
ment, timing/indication for therapy, and/or treatment goals.
Some of the chemotherapy websites provided outdated infor-
mation, and some of surgery websites used outdated descrip-
tions of the surgical intervention.
Readability Level and Accuracy Score
Websites with an accuracy score of 5 had the highest median
readability (16 [IQR, 14-17]). The readability levels of websites
having accuracy scores of 4, 3, 2, and 1 were 14.4 (IQR, 13.0-
16.1), 14.25 (IQR, 13.3-15.6), 14.9 (IQR, 13.3-16.7), and 14 (IQR,
14-16), respectively. The readability levels were different
among the websites with different accuracy scores (P = .01).
Significant differences in reading ease were found when web-
sites with an accuracy score of 5 were compared with those
with an accuracy score of 1 (P = .003), 3 (P = .003), and 4
(P = .002).
Readability Level and Website Affiliation
Median readability levels are shown in Table 4. There was a
statistically significant difference in readability levels among
the affiliation categories (P < .001). Websites owned by non-
profit organizations (median readability level, 12.9 [IQR, 11.2-
15.0]) were easier to read than websites owned by the media

Discussion
Internet use has increased dramatically in the past 2 decades.
Over 80% of the US population uses the Internet,26 including
53% of people older than 65 years of age.27 Forty percent of
Americans use the Internet to search for health information.28
Onlinehealthresourceshavethepotentialtobecomepow-
erful tools to help patients become better informed and to en-
able them to have meaningful discussions with health care
professionals.5,6,14,29 However, unguided health-related
searchesbypatientsmayhaveanegativeeffectonpatientcare,
decision making, and outcomes.3,5-8,19,20,30,31
Arecentreport4foundthatonly55%ofthosewhosearched
the Internet for health inquiries ultimately pursued profes-
sionalhealthcarebecauseoffinanciallimitations.Amongthose
who search the Internet, 92% believe that health searches em-
power them to make health care decisions, and 70% are
strongly influenced by the Internet when choosing a course of
treatment.4,7,18-20 However, half of surveyed oncologists re-
port that Internet searches have a negative effect on their pa-
tients owing to the inaccuracy of content and information
overload.20,30
According to the 2014 population-level survey data, 99%
of the US population has completed 5 to 6 years of formal
education.32 The American Medical Association therefore rec-
ommends a sixth-grade reading level for patient-oriented edu-
cation materials targeting the general population. Within our
sample, the median readability level of all website categories
was higher than recommended, requiring at least 13 years of
educationtobecomprehended.Only58%oftheadultUSpopu-
lation has attained this level of education (Table 1). These data
indicate that online information on pancreatic cancer is geared
to more educated groups. The general population and vulner-
able groups with particularly low health literacy will likely
struggletounderstandthisinformation.Thisisconsistentwith
Friedmanetal,33whostudiedonlineresourcesoncolon,breast,
and prostate cancer. Like Friedman et al,33 we found that gov-
ernment-affiliated websites were written at a collegiate read-
ing level, targeting the most educated 29% of the population
(Table 1). Unlike Friedman et al,33 we found university-based
websites were harder to read; they exhibited the second high-
est median readability level after media-owned websites.
Interestingly, this study found that accuracy was associ-
atedwithadifficultreadinglevel.Thisillustratesoneofthechal-
lenges incurred in the creation of accurate, yet understandable
online information about a complex disease and its treatment
options.Thislimitationmaybeatleastinpartovercomebycon-
veying information in visual forms, which are known to in-
creaseattention,improvecomprehension,andencouragesearch-
ing for more information, especially among patients with low
literacyskills.34,35Thedesignofeducationalmaterialsofthehigh-
est accuracy should involve the continuous evaluation of the
readabilityleveltoensurethatpatients’comprehensionwillnot
be compromised. When there are known high readability lev-
els, visual aids should be used to aid the reader.
Overall, websites discussing treatment modalities for pan-
creatic cancer were reasonably accurate, except for those dis-
cussingalternativetherapies.Alternativetherapywebsitescon-
tained more noticeable inaccuracies and contained seemingly
incorrect information, as reported by the raters. Low accuracy
in online resources discussing alternative therapies has been
documented before.1 Previous reports have shown the associa-
tion of the domain “.org” with more relevant and unbiased
information.1 This domain has been reported to acknowledge
areas of uncertainty, address treatment choices more thor-
oughly, and provide more support for shared decision making
compared with the “.com,
” “.edu,
” and “.gov” domains.33 Al-
thoughtheacquisitionofan“.org”domainisnotrestricted,such
domains are mostly used by nonprofit organizations, whereas
the“.com”domainispreferredbyprivatecompanies;the“.gov”
and “.edu” domains are restricted to government entities and
postsecondary institutions, respectively. In our sample, non-
profit, government, and academic websites were found to be
largely accurate. Martin-Facklam et al36 reported that the ab-
senceofafinancialinterestandtheinclusionofcitationsforsci-
entific facts were associated with higher accuracy. Websites in
these categories (ie, nonprofit organizations, government, and
academic) may be more likely to comply with an expected edu-
cational goal and to be patient-centered.7 On the other hand,
websites of private holders and communication media may be
more diverse in terms of quality. For example, it has been re-
portedthatmediaresourcesattractthereader’
sattentionbyfo-
cusing on controversy, which created confusion among
readers.37 Some websites may be genuinely committed to the
patient’
s well-being, whereas others will present biased infor-
mation influenced by commercial or audience interests.
Notably, none of the 10 websites discussing alternative
therapies had an academic or government affiliation. Four of
the websites were privately owned, 4 belonged to the media,
and 2 were for nonprofit organizations. Conversely, the web-
sites discussing clinical trials (7 websites) and radiotherapy (5
websites) were academic websites of high accuracy. This
implies that accurate sources of online information tend to
overlook the role of alternative therapies in pancreatic can-
cer. Consequently, the information gap is dominated by web-
sites of lower accuracy. Government and academic websites
should be comprehensive in providing accurate information
about all treatment modalities.

Patients may benefit from recommendations by physi-
cians of websites pertaining to their disease. A survey of 330
patients showed that 62.1% of respondents believe their phy-
sicians should recommend specific websites to learn more
about their health condition.38 In particular, patients who are
most vulnerable to poor cancer outcomes (ie, those with low
socioeconomic status, low education levels, and weak sup-
port networks) might be most likely to benefit from guidance
in the selection of sources of alternate information. Online re-
sources could represent a powerful instrument for health care
professionalstostrengthenpatient-physicianrelationshipsand
to stimulate active patient participation in the decision-
making process.
Thereareseverallimitationstothisstudy.Readabilitylevel
does not assess the role of previous knowledge, motivation to
learn, illustrations, use of active voice, use of examples, and
organization of text in relation to comprehension.24,39 In ad-
dition, standard readability tests may be inherently limited by
the challenge of analyzing complex medical conditions with
inherently longer words. This may lead to higher reading level
results regardless of the effort to write at an accessible read-
inglevel.Futurestudiesareneedtoevaluatehowreadingease,
assessed through widely used readability tests, correlates with
subjective patient comprehension of complex diseases such
as pancreatic cancer.
Based on the modern multidisciplinary approach to the
treatment of pancreatic cancer, we assumed that the 4 raters
wereexpertsinevaluatingtheonlineeducationalmaterialsdis-
cussing the 5 treatment options. When evaluating accuracy,
they compared information with the best available evidence
on current practice. To reduce subjectivity in scoring, we de-
termined that websites should be 100% accurate; if inaccura-
cies were present, the raters scored the websites in terms of
the proportion of the inaccuracies contained. The adaptation
of printed materials for scoring systems would not have been
ideal. We are unaware of the existence of validated scoring sys-
tems to evaluate accuracy of patient-targeted online re-
sources addressing therapy options; however, we believe that
our scoring system was adapted to answer our primary re-
search question. Our study did not analyze “completeness” as
a distinct entity. In Internet resources, the evaluation of com-
pleteness is questionable given that websites may be de-
signed to address one specific topic, in particular, and still be
accurate, although not complete.2,18 We did not assess the im-
pactofgraphictoolsordiagramsusedtocomplementandsum-
marizeinformation.Thenumberofwebsitesevaluatedissmall
but was selected to match Internet use practices.
Finally, non-English websites were excluded from this
study. Owing to the growing number of non-English–
speaking patients, studying and improving online educa-
tional materials in other languages would be important. De-
spite these limitations, this is the first study to our knowledge
to evaluate the readability and accuracy of online resources
discussing pancreatic cancer treatment.
Conclusions
Two conclusions arise from this study. We demonstrated that
onlineinformationonpancreaticcanceroverestimatestheread-
ing ability of the overall population. This may have its greatest
impact among those with low literacy and limited access to
health care. We also documented appreciable differences
among websites discussing treatment modalities and among
websiteaffiliations.Nonprofit,academic,andgovernmentweb-
sites had the highest accuracy, particularly websites relating to
clinical trials and radiotherapy. In the absence of an Internet
librarian, health care professionals should acknowledge that
online information on aggressive diseases such as pancreatic
cancer could be misleading and potentially harmful, and, thus,
they should assume an active role in the evaluation and rec-
ommendation of online resources, selecting readable and ac-
curate online resources for their patients, as an instrument to
empower patients in the shared decision-making process.
