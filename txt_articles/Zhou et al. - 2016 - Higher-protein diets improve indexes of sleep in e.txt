ABSTRACT
Background: Limited and inconsistent research findings exist about
the effect of dietary protein intake on indexes of sleep.
Objective: We assessed the effect of protein intake during dietary
energy restriction on indexes of sleep in overweight and obese
adults in 2 randomized, controlled feeding studies.
Design: For study 1, 14 participants [3 men and 11 women; mean 6 SE
age: 56 6 3 y; body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2): 30.9 6 0.6] consumed
energy-restricteddiets(a750-kcal/d deficit)with either beefandpork(BP;
n = 5) or soy and legume (SL; n = 9) as the main protein sources for 3
consecutive4-wk periodswith 10%(control),20%,or30%oftotalenergy
from protein (random order). At baseline and the end of each period, the
global sleep score (GSS) was assessed with the use of the Pittsburgh Sleep
Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. For study 2, 44 participants (12 men
and32women;age:526 1y;BMI:31.460.5)consumeda3-wkbaseline
energy-balance diet with 0.8 g protein $ kg baseline body mass21 $ d21.
Then,study2subjectsconsumedeitheranormal-protein[NP(control);n=
23] or a high-protein (HP; n = 21) (0.8 compared with 1.5 g $ kg21 $ d21,
respectively) energy-restricted diet (a 750-kcal/d deficit) for 16 wk. The
PSQI was administered during baseline week 3 and intervention weeks 4,
8, 12, and 16. GSSs ranged from 0 to 21 arbitrary units (au), with a higher
value representing a worse GSS during the preceding month.
Results: In study 1, we showed that a higher protein quantity improved
GSSs independent of the protein source. The GSS was higher (P ,
0.05) when 10% (6.0 6 0.4 au) compared with 20% (5.0 6 0.4 au)
protein was consumed, with 30% protein (5.4 6 0.6 au) intermediate. In
study 2, at baseline, the GSS was not different between NP (5.2 6 0.5
au) and HP (5.4 6 0.5 au) groups. Over time, the GSS was unchanged
for the NP group and improved for the HP group (P-group-by-time
interaction , 0.05). After intervention (week 16), GSSs for NP and
HP groups were 5.9 6 0.5 and 4.0 6 0.6 au, respectively (P , 0.01).
Conclusion: The consumption of a greater proportion of energy from
protein while dieting may improve sleep in overweight and obese adults.
This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01005563 (study 1)
and NCT01692860 (study 2).

INTRODUCTION
Sleep is essential to health. Indexes of sleep including dura-
tion, quality, and patterning are related to obesity, type 2 diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, hypertension, worsened lipid metabo-
lism, and premature death (1–6). All of these morbidities and
mortality are also affected by diet (7–11). The 2015 Dietary
Guidelines Advisory Committee recognized “an insufficient
body of evidence” in the “emerging area” of “associations be-
tween sleep patterns, dietary intakes, and obesity risk” and that
“a paucity of research exists on the potential impact of diet on
sleep-related outcomes” (12). Currently, the majority of research
has assessed the influence of sleep on energy balance (13–15) or
dietary choices (15–18). Limited research exists on the effects of
dietary energy and macronutrients, especially protein intake, on
indexes of sleep (19).
Cross-sectional studies have shown that dietary protein intake
was associated with sleep duration, quality, and patterns. Habitual
protein intake was positively correlated with sleep duration
(except for adults who slept .9 h) (20), and normal sleepers
consumed more protein than did people with insomnia (21).
Also, higher protein intake was associated with an earlier mid-
point of sleep (22), indicating that protein intake may influence
the timing of sleep. More generally, middle-aged adults who
consumed a moderate protein intake showed a lower OR for
poor sleep-wake regularity than that of adults with low protein
intake (23). In contrast, other research has shown that protein
intake was negatively associated with sleep duration (24). Col-
lectively, these epidemiologic studies provide support that di-
etary protein intake may be an important moderator of indexes
of sleep, but evidence of how that moderation works has been
inconsistent or not understood.

 Intervention studies that have investigated dietary protein ef-
fects on sleep have been mostly relatively short-term (4–21-d)
studies. In 1978, Lacey et al. (25) reported that, after a 7-d dietary
intervention, consumption of higher (.100 g/d) and lower
(,15 g/d) protein diets increased restlessness in sleep more than
a normal protein diet did, whereas slow-wave sleep was not dif-
ferent in the interventions. More recently, a 4-d intervention study
showed that the ingestion of a very high–protein diet (56% of
energy from protein) reduced wake episodes more than did
a normal-protein diet (15% of energy from protein) (26). A 21-d
study showed that no difference in sleep outcomes existed in
3 protein-intake trials (2.4 compared with 1.6 compared with
0.8 g $ kg body weight21 $ d21) during weight loss (a 40% energy
deficit) in normal and overweight healthy military individuals
(27). Collectively, these short-term studies that included extreme
protein intakes and energy deficits have provided inconsistent
findings on whether protein intake affects indexes of sleep.
The purpose of the current research was to assess the effect of
sustained protein intake on indexes of sleep during weight loss in
middle-aged overweight and obese adults in 2 randomized,
controlled intervention studies. Study 1 was designed to assess
the effects of the protein source and quantity on appetite re-
sponses, and study 2 aimed to investigate the effects of higher
protein intake on body composition and metabolic health. In-
dexes of sleep were measured as part of these studies as sec-
ondary outcomes. We hypothesized that indexes of sleep would
improve with higher protein intake.
METHODS
Studies 1 and 2: ethics and protocol registration
Both study protocols received approval from the Institutional
Review Board at Purdue University. The studies complied with the
Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 2013. Each participant signed
an informed consent document and received a monetary stipend for
participation. Studies 1 and 2 were registered at clinicaltrials.gov
as NCT01005563 and NCT01692860, respectively.
Study 1: participants
Thirty-four healthy, overweight and obese adults from the
greater Lafayette, Indiana, region completed the intervention
study (Figure 1). Inclusion criteria were as follows: $21 y of
age; BMI (in kg/m2) range from 27.0 to 37.9; nonsmoking;
weight stable (63 kg) and habitual or stable activity patterns
3 mo before the study; and the absence of acute or chronic dis-
eases or use of medications known to influence protein or energy
metabolism. A subset of 14 participants [n = 5 in the beef and
pork (BP)6 group, and n = 9 in the soy and legume (SL) group]
were assessed for indexes of sleep with the use of the Pittsburgh
Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (28).
To document responses to the designed protein intakes,
postprandial plasma amino acid profiles were assessed in
a separate subset of 10 participants (n = 5 for BP, and n = 5 for
SL; of these 10 participants, 7 subjects also completed the
PSQI (n = 4 for BP, and n = 3 for SL).
Study 1: experimental design
The randomized crossover study included an initial 2-wk
baseline period and 3 consecutive 4-wk periods of energy re-
striction (ER) (750-kcal/d deficits from each individual’s energy
need). Randomizer.org [Research Randomizer (Version 4.0)] was
used to create a balanced block design. First, participants were
randomly assigned to BP and SL groups (separate for men and
women). Then, for each group, participants were randomly as-
signed to the 6 combinations of 10%, 20%, and 30% protein in-
takes. During baseline and day 28 of each intervention period,
body composition measurements and the PSQI were completed. In
addition, postprandial plasma concentrations of amino acids were
measured on day 28 of each intervention period.
Study 1: diet
Each participant’s total energy requirement was estimated
with the use of the sex-specific equations for overweight and
obese adults published by the US Institute of Medicine (29). The
10%, 20%, and 30% of energy intakes from dietary protein were
chosen because they approximately spanned the Acceptable
Macronutrient Distribution Range for protein (10–35% of
energy intake). Participants consumed their habitual diets dur-
ing the 2-wk baseline period. Macronutrient compositions of
intervention diets were 25% fat; 10%, 20%, or 30% protein; and
65%, 55%, or 45% carbohydrate; respectively. The protein
sources were as follows: 30% SL (SL group) or 30% BP (BP
group); 20% dairy; 5% egg; 20% grains, breads, and flours;
and 25% other (i.e., vegetables, fruit, nuts, and beverages).
Participants were given shopping lists to self-purchase most of
the foods and beverages with the use of a 3-d rotating menu with
BP and SL foods provided. Each participant met with the
registered dietitians weekly for dietary counseling and was given
instructions on the amount (e.g., cups, teaspoons, tablespoons,
and grams) of each food and beverage to consume. A sample
menu is shown in Supplemental Table 1A. Fasting blood (se-
rum) urea nitrogen (BUN), which was measured at baseline and
on day 28 of each 4-wk period, was used as a crude index of
dietary protein intakes during the study (30, 31) and as a mea-
sure of dietary compliance.
Study 2: participants
We recruited 69 overweight or obese adults (BMI range: 25–
38) from the greater Lafayette, Indiana, region, of whom 48
adults completed the study, and 44 adults were included in the
data analyses (Figure 2). Inclusion criteria were as follows:
either male or female; age: 35–65 y; weight stable (63 kg) 3 mo
before the study; no acute illness; not diabetic, pregnant, or
lactating; not currently (or #3 mo before the study) following an
exercise or weight-loss program; nonsmoking; lactose tolerant;
natural waist circumference $102 cm for men and $88 cm for
women; fasting serum glucose concentration ,110 mg/dL;
systolic and diastolic blood pressures ,140/90 mm Hg; serum
total cholesterol concentration ,260 mg/dL; LDL-cholesterol con-
centration ,160 mg/dL; triacylglycerol concentration ,400 mg/dL;
and clinically normal serum albumin and prealbumin concentrations.

 Study 2: experimental design
Study 2 was a 20-wk randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled,
double-blind study (with a 1-wk prestudy measurement, a 3-wk
baseline, and a 16-wk ER intervention). The week before
baseline, participant habitual diet intakes and general health
status were accessed via 3-d dietary recalls and blood samples,
respectively. During a 3-wk baseline period, subjects consumed
an energy-balanced diet with 0.8 g protein $ kg baseline body
mass21 $ d21. Then, subjects were randomly assigned with the
use of the first generator (6 participants/block with separate
random assignment; 10 blocks for women and 4 blocks for men)
on Randomization.com and assigned to either a normal-protein
(NP; n = 23) or a high-protein (HP; n = 21) diet (0.8 compared
with 1.5 g $ kg21 $ d21) with ER (a 750-kcal/d deficit) during
a 16-wk intervention period.
Study 2: diet
Each participant’s total energy requirement was estimated
with the use of the sex-specific equations for overweight and
obese adults published by the US Institute of Medicine (29).
During the 3-wk baseline period, all participants consumed
a weight-maintenance diet with 0.8 g protein $ kg21 $ d21 and
selected food and beverage items (breakfast: biscuit, gravy, and
pancake; lunch: ham and cheese casserole, chowders, and pizza
crust; and snack: muffins and smoothies) with 0.7 g $ kg21 $ d21
of the carbohydrate powder maltodextrin (Muscle Feast LLC)
mixed in. During the 16-wk intervention period, participants
were randomly assigned to either the NP group (total protein
intake: 0.8 g protein $ kg21 $ d21) or the HP group (total protein
intake: 1.5 g protein $ kg21 $ d21). The NP group continued to
consume the selected food and beverage items that contained
maltodextrin, whereas the HP group switched to the consump-
tion of these selected food and beverage items that contained
0.7 g protein $ kg21 $ d21 with the use of milk protein isolate-85
(MPI-85; Idaho Milk Products Inc.). The energy deficit was
achieved by removing 750 kcal of nonprotein foods and
beverages/d from each participant’s menus. Participants were
counseled with 7-d rotating menus and shopping lists to self-
purchase most foods and beverages and provided with the
selected foods and beverages that contained the carbohydrate
or MPI-85 powders. Each participant met with a registered
dietitian weekly for dietary counseling and was given in-
structions on the amount (e.g., cups, teaspoons, tablespoons,
and grams) of each food and beverage to consume. A sample
menu is shown in Supplemental Table 1B. Fasting BUN was
measured every 4 wk to indicate the compliance with protein
intake.
Studies 1 and 2: body composition
BMI was calculated from the fasting-state body mass mea-
sured to the nearest 0.01 kg with the use of a digital platform scale
(model ES200L; Ohaus Corp.), and standing height without shoes

 was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm with the use of a wall-
mounted stadiometer. The fasting-state body mass was measured
monthly (study 1) or weekly (study 2) during the intervention to
document the effectiveness of and compliance with the energy-
restricted diets.
Studies 1 and 2: PSQI
The PSQI questionnaire is a clinical sleep-behavior ques-
tionnaire that has been validated for use in patients with insomnia,
cancer, Parkinson disease, and the general population (28). The
questionnaire is designed to assess indexes of sleep during the
preceding 1-mo interval and contains 19 questions that use Likert
scales from 0 to 3. All questions are categorized into the fol-
lowing 7 subvariables: duration of sleep, sleep disturbance, sleep
latency, day dysfunction because of sleepiness, sleep efficiency,
subjective sleep quality, and use of a sleeping medication. Each of
these 7 variables is scored between 0 and 3 arbitrary units (au),
which generates a summed total score of 0–21 au. This total
score is termed the global sleep score (GSS) with .5 au asso-
ciated with a poor sleep condition and #5 au associated with
a good sleep condition. The PSQI also has a question that in-
dicates the routine sleep duration in hours (numerical).
In study 1, the PSQI questionnaire was completed by 14
participants at baseline and at the end of each 4-wk intervention
period. In study 2, the PSQI questionnaire was completed by 48
participants at baseline week 3 and at intervention weeks 4, 8, 12,
and 16.
Study 1: plasma free amino acid analyses
On day 28 of each of the 3 intervention periods, participants
reported to the clinical laboratory after fasting overnight. Par-
ticipants consumed a test meal that provided 25% of their in-
dividualized daily energy intakes, which corresponded to their
assigned diets during the period. Fasting and postmeal (25-, 60-,
120-, 180-, and 240-min) blood samples were collected into
plasma separator tubes, centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 3 g and
48C, transferred into 1-mL aliquot tubes, and stored at 2808C
until they were thawed for analysis. Plasma free amino acids for
a subsample of participants (5 women in the BP group; 1 man
and 4 women in the SL group) were quantified with the use of
cation-exchange chromatography–HPLC coupled with post-
column ninhydrin derivatization and quantitation (32) by the
Agricultural Experimental Station Chemical Laboratories, Uni-
versity of Missouri-Columbia. We present data for all 10 of
these participants instead of the 7 subjects who completed the
PSQI questionnaire. The purpose was to document postprandial
plasma amino acid responses to the dietary interventions but not
to correlate the data to the sleep data. Results are expressed as

PROTEIN INTAKE AND INDEXES OF SLEEP

 the total AUC (with 0 mg/mL as the baseline) for 240 min after
an acute meal with the use of the trapezoidal rule (33). Because
the brain uptake of tryptophan (Trp) and tyrosine (Tyr) depend
on the plasma availabilities of other large neutral amino acids
(LNAAs) (i.e., Trp, Tyr, phenylalanine, leucine, valine, and
isoleucine) (34, 35), we also calculated the Trp AUC, Tyr AUC,
Trp AUC:LNAA AUC ratio (Trp:LNAAs), and the Tyr AUC:
LNAAs AUC ratio (Tyr:LNAAs).
Studies 1 and 2: power calculations and statistical analyses
Although the indexes of sleep are secondary measurements for
both studies 1 and 2, we conducted effect-size calculations for
both studies before implementing the PSQI questionnaire.
Study 1
For the within-subject, crossover-designed study, an a priori
power calculation was completed for 2 dependent means (cor-
relation was set at 0.5) to detect a difference equal to 1 SD in
protein-quantity interventions (a = 0.05; 80% power; 2 tailed).
The effect size was one, and the total number of participants
needed was 10. Baseline characteristics were assessed with
the use of an independent Student’s t test between BP- and
SL-protein–source groups. We first assessed the effects of time
(repeated variable) and protein source on body mass, BUN,
GSS, and subvariables in the PSQI. Second, the effects of the
protein quantity (repeated variable) and source on postprandial
plasma amino acid concentrations, the GSS, and subvariables in
the PSQI were assessed. The baseline GSS (or subvariables) and
body mass change from the previous period were used as co-
variates for analyses of the GSS (or subvariables). Post hoc
analyses between protein-quantity interventions were conducted
with the use of Bonferroni correction.
Study 2
For the between-subject parallel designed study, an a priori
power calculation was completed for 2 independent means to
detect a difference equal to 1 SD in protein-quantity interventions
(a = 0.05; 80% power; 2 tailed). The effect size was one, and the
number of participants needed was 34 (n = 17/group). Baseline
characteristics were assessed with the use of an independent
Student’s t test between HP- and NP-diet groups. The effects of
diet and time on the dependent variables (body mass, BUN, the
GSS, and 7 subvariables in the PSQI) were determined via a
2-factor ANOVA with repeated measures of time. Age, sex, and
baseline values were used as covariates in all analyses. Residual
plots were used to check model assumptions. Post hoc analyses
were conducted with the use of Bonferroni correction between
the 2 groups and from baseline to the end of intervention for
each group.
All data analyses were completed with the use of the Proc
Mixed procedure with SAS 9.3 for Windows software (SAS
Institute Inc.). Results are presented as least-square means 6 SEs
unless otherwise noted. Least-square means 6 SEs are the
model-adjusted means (adjusted on the basis of the covariates
and an unbalanced study design) and SEMs from SAS outputs
that reflect the statistical results. Significance was determined at
P , 0.05.
RESULTS
Participant characteristics at baseline
Study 1
Of 14 participants, the mean 6 SE age was 56 6 3 y, and BMI
was 30.9 6 0.6. There were no differences in these variables
between BP and SL groups (data not shown). Baseline indexes
of sleep that were measured with the use of the PSQI are shown
in Supplemental Table 2.
Study 2
Among the 44 participants who completed the study and were
included for data analyses, mean 6 SE age was 52 6 1 y and
BMI was 31.4 6 0.5. No differences were observed in age, BMI,
habitual energy and macronutrient intakes, and indexes of sleep
between the HP and NP groups (Supplemental Table 2, Sup-
plemental Table 3).
Dietary compliance
Participants in both studies were apparently compliant with the
designated diets on the basis of the serum BUN for total protein
intake and reduced body mass for ER.
Study 1
According to the prescribed energy-restricted diet (mean 6
SE: 1614 6 74 kcal/d), 10%, 20%, and 30% of energy intakes
from protein would provide w40, 81, and 121 g protein/d, re-
spectively. With the use of calculations of protein intakes that
were determined on a baseline body mass basis (mean 6 SE:
85.3 6 2.8 kg), intakes were w0.47, 0.95, and 1.42 g $ kg21 $ d21,
respectively.
Fasting serum BUN was not different between BP and SL
groups at baseline or at the end of the 10%, 20%, or 30% protein
feeding periods (Supplemental Figure 1A). At the end of the
three 4-wk feeding periods, BUN was progressively higher
with higher protein intake. Body mass progressively decreased
over time independent of the dietary protein source (Supple-
mental Figure 2A).
Study 2
Fasting serum BUN was not different between HP and NP
groups at baseline but was higher in the HP group during the
16-wk period of ER (Supplemental Figure 1B). Both groups
lost body mass over time with no difference in responses
between HP and NP groups (Supplemental Figure 2B).
Postprandial plasma amino acids concentrations (study 1)
Overall, a higher dietary protein intake increased circulating
Trp and Tyr concentrations (Supplemental Table 4). For Trp,
consumption of a meal with 30% protein resulted in a higher
composite postprandial response than when meals with 20% or
10% protein were consumed. However, there were no differ-
ences in postprandial Trp:LNAAs between protein-intake trials.
For Tyr, higher protein consumption resulted in higher post-
prandial responses. The Tyr:LNAA ratio was not influenced
by protein intake. The protein source did not influence these
variables.

 GSS
The consumption of a higher quantity of protein during ER
resulted in lower (better) GSSs in both studies.
Study 1
At baseline, 8 participants (57%) were classified as poor
sleepers (GSS .5 au), but 7 (50%), 7 (50%), and 2 (14%)
subjects were classified as poor sleepers at the end of the 10%,
20%, and 30% protein–intake periods, respectively.
There was no difference in GSSs between BP and SL groups
(data not shown). In all participants, the GSS was higher when
10% protein was consumed than when 20% protein was con-
sumed (Figure 3A). The consumption of 30% protein did not
further improve the GSS.
Study 2
At the end of baseline and intervention weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16,
the numbers of poor sleepers in the HP group were 8 (38%),
6 (29%), 5 (24%), 5 (24%), and 4 (19%), whereas in the NP group,
7 (30%), 9 (39%), 12 (52%), 10 (43%), and 9 (39%) participants
were poor sleepers.
At baseline, GSSs were comparable between HP and NP
groups. However, during the period of weight loss, the GSS
response was different between groups (Figure 3B) (P-group-by-
time interaction = 0.035). Post hoc analyses indicated that GSSs
were lower in the HP group than in the NP group at intervention
weeks 12 (3.9 6 0.5 compared with 6.0 6 0.5 au, respectively)
and 16 (4.0 6 0.6 compared with 5.9 6 0.5 au, respectively).
Other variables from the PSQI
Protein intake did not influence other variables except for the
use of sleeping medication in study 2.
Study 1
Sleep duration was not influenced by the protein source or
intake. The 7 subvariables of PSQI were not influenced by the
protein source or intake (Supplemental Table 5A).
Study 2
Sleep duration was not influenced by ER or protein intake
(Supplemental Table 3B). The use of sleeping medication changed
over time differently between groups (Supplemental Table 3B)
(P-group-by-time interaction = 0.033). Compared with at baseline,
the use of sleeping medication increased in the NP group (P =
0.003) and did not change in the HP group. The other 6 sub-
variables of the PSQI were not influenced by protein intake
(Supplemental Table 5B).
DISCUSSION
Because two-thirds of the US population are overweight or
obese (36), an understanding of the effects of dietary energy and
macronutrients on sleep quality or duration in groups of people
with excess weight may prove clinically important. Indexes of
sleep have been suggested to be associated with numerous
metabolic dysfunctions including obesity, type 2 diabetes, hy-
pertension, and cardiovascular diseases (1–6). A subjective sleep
score by the PSQI was also suggested to be associated with the
metabolic syndrome (37). Our studies provide evidence to
strengthen the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee
statements that “indices of sleep” may be a “mediator or mod-
erator” (12) of dietary effects on metabolic health risks and
emphasize the importance of including sleep-variable measure-
ments in dietary studies that aim for weight loss or an im-
provement of metabolic health to elucidate proper mechanisms.
In both studies 1 and 2, as was consistent with our hypothesis,
the GSS was lower (better) after the higher-protein diets were
consumed than after the lower-protein diets were consumed
during ER-induced weight loss. To our knowledge, the results
from study 2, which is the longest-term (16-wk) randomized
controlled trial to assess the effect of protein intake on sleep,
concur with those from study 1 and provide novel information on
the time course of the improvements in sleep after higher dietary
protein was consumed. Strengths of the 2 studies included
controlling and objectively documenting adherence to the pre-
scribed diets both for energy intake (body mass changes) and total
protein intake (differences in BUN concentrations).
Our results are inconsistent with those of Karl et al. (27) who
reported that young normal and overweight military personnel
did not have improved sleep quality after the consumption of 2.4
(high; n = 12) compared with 1.6 (moderate; n = 14) compared
with 0.8 (low, n = 13) g protein $ kg21 $ d21 during a 21-d period
of weight loss (30% ER and 10% physical activity). Our study

PROTEIN INTAKE AND INDEXES OF SLEEP

 1 protein-specific intervention periods were conducted in about
the same time frame (4 wk) as in this parallel-design study but
used a within-subject crossover design that may have had more
statistical power. Indeed, the changes in the sleep quality index
(measured with the use of the Karolinska Sleep Diary, whereby
a lower score represents better sleep quality) were 0.5 compared
with 0.1 compared with 20.3 au in the groups with low-,
moderate-, and high-protein intakes, respectively, which sug-
gested that high protein intake may be beneficial. However,
caution is warranted when our results are compared with those
of Karl et al. (27) because of the weight-status and age differ-
ences of the participants in the 2 studies. Sleep problems are
generally more likely to occur in people with higher BMI (38)
and older age (39). Thus, we studied groups of people who may
have been more likely to have had poor sleep quality (supported
by a group mean GSS ,5 au at baseline) and to have been
positively affected by interventions [such as higher protein in-
take (23)] to improve sleep. In addition, except for ER, Karl
et al. (27) designed a 10% energy deficit as physical activity.
This designation may have masked the effect of protein intakes
on sleep because acute and regular physical activity were sug-
gested to improve both subjective sleep and objective sleep (40).
In both studies 1 and 2, the energy contents of the diets with
different amounts of protein were equalized by manipulating
carbohydrate intakes but keeping fat intakes the same. Thus, we
could not exclude the possibility that lower carbohydrate
intake in the trials with 20% protein (1.5 g $ kg21 $ d21) may
have contributed to better GSSs than the trials with 10% protein
(0.8 g $ kg21 $ d21). We described both studies with respect to
protein intake because the magnitude of protein intake doubled
from 10% to 20%, but carbohydrate only decreased about one-
seventh from 65% to 55%. Results from an acute-feeding study
showed that more carbohydrate consumption before bedtime
may increase postprandial insulin secretion, which preferentially
assists Trp rather than LNAAs being transported through the
blood-brain barrier (41). This implies greater synthesis of se-
rotonin and melatonin and, thus, better sleep (6, 19, 42, 43).
However, short-term dietary studies have not provided consis-
tent results. Afaghi et al. (44) reported that healthy adults had
increased slow wave sleep and decreased rapid eye movement
sleep when they consumed a very low carbohydrate diet (,1%
of energy from carbohydrate) for 1 or 2 d than when a control
diet (72% of energy from carbohydrate) was consumed (44).
Whether a shift from rapid eye movement sleep to slow-wave
sleep translates into better sleep or not is unclear. The common
understanding is that slow-wave sleep is restorative and pro-
motes anabolic processes of the body (45).
Although higher protein intake resulted in greater postprandial
plasma amino acid responses, these results are not intended to
infer on the mechanisms by which higher protein intake may
improve sleep. The mechanism of the effect of protein on sleep
after acute feeding may be related to Trp, Tyr, and the synthesis of
brain neurotransmitters (serotonin, melatonin, and dopamine)
(19, 46–50). Plasma Trp:LNAA and Tyr:LNAA ratios have been
predictors of brain Trp and Tyr concentrations, respectively, in
rat studies (51–53). It was previously shown that high-protein
diets produce more LNAAs than Trp and Tyr. The higher
LNAAs compete with Trp or Tyr for the blood-brain barrier
transporter, thereby leading to reduced brain serotonin or do-
pamine synthesis (41). Therefore, it was proposed that the
consumption of higher-protein meals may not promote sleep
acutely. Our results showed otherwise; 30% compared with 20%
compared with 10% protein intakes did not change the Trp:
LNAA and Tyr:LNAAs ratios after an acute meal. In a 4-wk
intervention study conducted in rhesus monkeys, the authors
reported that a higher-protein diet induced higher 24-h plasma
and cerebrospinal fluid Trp and serotonin metabolites (54).
Thus, acclimated protein intake may have modified the
body’s ability to produce or remove brain Trp and serotonin
in a yet-to-be-determined way. To assess the long-term ef-
fects of protein intake on the plasma amino acids profile and
synthesis of brain neurotransmitters, measurements during
sleep are needed.
Another study-design factor to consider is the predominant
protein source. In study 1, we did not observe differences in sleep
quality and duration between BP and SL groups. In study 2, milk-
protein concentrate was used to achieve higher protein intake.
Milk protein contains mainly casein (80%) and whey (20%)
proteins (55). The whey-derived a-lactalbumin was suggested to
improve sleep quality or related outcomes in both animals and
humans because of its high content of Trp (56–58). In both study
1 and 2, we observed consistent improvements in indexes of
sleep, which inferred that the consumption of a higher protein
quantity from a variety of protein sources improves sleep, but
more research is warranted.
The results from the 2 studies presented have clinical rele-
vance for sleep problems. First, the improvements in sleep with
higher-protein diets occurred as a large percentage of partici-
pants shifted from being categorized by the PSQI questionnaire
as poor sleepers to good sleepers. Second, as regards weight
loss, the general consensus is that weight loss increases sleep
duration and improves sleep quality (59–61). However, in study
2, sleep only improved in the HP group, whereas it was
unchanged in the NP group after weight loss. These results
suggest that the composition of a diet may affect weight-loss-
induced improvements in sleep and that, for overweight and
obese adults, the consumption of 0.8 g protein $ kg21 $ d21 is
not enough to promote weight-loss–induced improvements in
sleep. Finally, in study 2, the observation that the use of
a sleeping medication increased over time in the NP group but
was not changed in the HP group may have indicated that
higher protein intake not only improved sleep but the means
used to promote sleep. We make this statement cautiously
because our studies did not include objective measurements
of sleep quality (e.g., actigraphy or polysomnography) or
sleep-related medication use.
There were limitations of these 2 randomized controlled trials.
First, for study 1, sleep measurements were only made in
a subgroup of 14 participants, which limited our ability to detect
differences between protein sources. Second, indexes of sleep
were secondary measurements in both studies. Therefore, we did
not set inclusion and exclusion criteria that were specific for
sleep. Third, self-reported measures such as the PSQI are subject
to biases. Results from this study need to be confirmed with the
use of objective measurements of sleep. In addition, the habitual
dietary intakes reported for study 2 were also self-reported, which
may not have been accurate (62). However, the habitual dietary
intake data were presented for descriptive purposes only and did
not affect the outcomes of interest, which were measured after the
subjects had acclimated to the prescribed, controlled diets.

 Finally, as previously mentioned, we did not have plasma amino
acid measurements during sleep, which prevented us from ex-
ploring relations to sleep variables.
In conclusion, the results from these 2 randomized controlled
diet studies indicate the middle-aged and older overweight and
moderately obese adults may improve sleep by maintaining
higher protein intakes when dieting to lose weight.
