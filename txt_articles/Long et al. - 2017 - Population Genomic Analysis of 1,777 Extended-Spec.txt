ABSTRACT
Klebsiella pneumoniae is a major human pathogen responsible for high
morbidity and mortality rates. The emergence and spread of strains resistant to mul-
tiple antimicrobial agents and documented large nosocomial outbreaks are espe-
cially concerning. To develop new therapeutic strategies for K. pneumoniae, it is im-
perative to understand the population genomic structure of strains causing human
infections. To address this knowledge gap, we sequenced the genomes of 1,777
extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae strains cultured from
patients in the 2,000-bed Houston Methodist Hospital system between September
2011 and May 2015, representing a comprehensive, population-based strain sample.
Strains of largely uncharacterized clonal group 307 (CG307) caused more infections
than those of well-studied epidemic CG258. Strains varied markedly in gene content
and had an extensive array of small and very large plasmids, often containing anti-
microbial resistance genes. Some patients with multiple strains cultured over time
were infected with genetically distinct clones. We identified 15 strains expressing the
New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) enzyme that confers broad resistance
to nearly all beta-lactam antibiotics. Transcriptome sequencing analysis of 10 phylo-
genetically diverse strains showed that the global transcriptome of each strain was
unique and highly variable. Experimental mouse infection provided new information
about immunological parameters of host-pathogen interaction. We exploited the
large data set to develop whole-genome sequence-based classifiers that accurately
predict clinical antimicrobial resistance for 12 of the 16 antibiotics tested. We con-
clude that analysis of large, comprehensive, population-based strain samples can as-
sist understanding of the molecular diversity of these organisms and contribute to
enhanced translational research.
IMPORTANCE
Klebsiella pneumoniae causes human infections that are increasingly
difficult to treat because many strains are resistant to multiple antibiotics. Clonal
group 258 (CG258) organisms have caused outbreaks in health care settings world-
wide. Using a comprehensive population-based sample of extended-spectrum beta-
lactamase (ESBL)-producing K. pneumoniae strains, we show that a relatively uncom-
mon clonal type, CG307, caused the plurality of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae
infections in our patients. We discovered that CG307 strains have been abundant in
Houston for many years. As assessed by experimental mouse infection, CG307 strains

 were as virulent as pandemic CG258 strains. Our results may portend the emergence of
an especially successful clonal group of antibiotic-resistant K. pneumoniae.
K
lebsiella pneumoniae is a major human pathogen responsible for high morbidity
and mortality rates (1–3). Numerous studies have investigated the genetic epide-
miology of K. pneumoniae infections in hospitalized patients in the United States and
elsewhere (3–8). These studies have often used low-resolution molecular typing
such as multilocus sequence typing (MLST) or have studied relatively small collec-
tions of organisms. Studies of hospitalized patients in the United States commonly
have reported a predominance of clonal group 258 (CG258) strains (9–12). CG258 was
first identified in 2009 as a single-locus variant of sequence type 11 (ST11) from
Hungary (13) and has since been reported worldwide. Data suggest that CG258
diverged from its most recent common ancestor in 1995, after acquisition of the
K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) gene (14).
K. pneumoniae strains producing KPC carbapenemase were first identified in North
Carolina in 1996 (15) and now cause multidrug-resistant hospital-acquired infections
globally (16). Evidence suggests that there is circulation of K. pneumoniae clones within
hospitals, with transmissible resistance plasmids shared between Klebsiella spp. and
other pathogens (5, 17–20). This sharing of resistance elements is believed to have
contributed to the emergence of multidrug resistance in K. pneumoniae and large,
hospital-based outbreaks. The increasing reports of these nosocomial outbreaks are of
great clinical concern (21, 22).
To develop new therapeutics and control strategies for K. pneumoniae, it is imper-
ative to understand the population genomic structure of strains causing human
infections. To begin filling this knowledge gap, we sequenced the genomes of 1,777
extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing K. pneumoniae strains (Table 1;
see Table S1A to C in the supplemental material) cultured from patients in the 2,000-bed
Houston Methodist Hospital system between September 2011 and May 2015. These
strains were all positive for ESBL production, which accounted for an average of 40% of
the K. pneumoniae strains in our laboratory during the study period. The Houston
Methodist Hospital system serves patients in the greater Houston metropolitan area
(population of approximately 6,000,000), now the most ethnically diverse population
center in the United States (23). In addition to our large and diverse local population,
patients routinely travel for treatment to Houston Methodist Hospital from across the
United States and internationally. The genome sequence data identified unexpectedly
high diversity. Strains varied markedly in gene content and had an extensively diverse
assortment of large plasmids. These transmissible plasmids often contain antimicrobial
resistance genes and represent important elements contributing to the dissemination
of resistance markers.
RESULTS
Whole-genome sequencing of 1,777 ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae strains
identified extensive genomic diversity within and between major clades. We
sequenced the genome of 1,777 ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae strains (Table 1 and

from infected patients in the 2,000-bed Houston Methodist Hospital system. The
sample represents virtually all of the ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae strains recovered
during this time period. Over half of the strains were cultured from urine (927 strains,
52.2%). The remainder were cultured from respiratory (384 strains, 21.6%), blood (147
strains, 8.3%), and other tissue, wound, and miscellaneous specimens (319 strains,
18.0%).
Much of the literature describing nosocomial outbreaks or hospital strain samples in
the United States and elsewhere has reported a predominance of CG258 strains,
regardless of the population studied (17, 24–29). In striking contrast, on the basis of
genome-wide phylogenetic analysis, our strains were broadly classified into three major
genetic clades (Fig. 1; Table 1). Approximately one-fourth (474 strains, 26.7%) were
assigned to CG258. These organisms represent progeny of a globally disseminated
epidemic clone reported to be the major cause of K. pneumoniae infections in the
United States (1, 13, 14, 30–32). The average minimum pairwise genetic distance (a
measure of genomic diversity in a population of related strains) between the CG258
strains in our sample was 346 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). More than
one-third of the strains (635, 35.7%) were assigned to CG307. These organisms were
cultured from patients at all of the hospitals in our system; that is, no single hospital
was responsible for the abundance of CG307 infections (Fig. 2). Similarly, CG258 strains

 caused infections in patients at all of our hospitals (Fig. 2). CG307 and CG258 strains
were common in our population throughout the study period (Fig. 3).
Although strains of CG307 have been identified sporadically in diverse locations
globally in recent years (10, 33–40), they have not been reported to be abundant causes
of infections in a large unbiased population over a multiyear period. The average
minimum pairwise genetic distance between the CG307 strains was 948 SNPs. Com-
pared to CG258 organisms that have been extensively studied, very little is known
about strains of CG307. The remaining strains (668 strains, 37.6%) in our sample were
a genetically heterogeneous array of multilocus STs reported to cause infections
worldwide. The average minimum pairwise genetic distance among these 668 strains
is 6,580 SNPs, reflecting the far greater diversity present in these strains than in CG258
and CG307 organisms. There were 99 unique previously defined STs present in the
strains sequenced (1,430 strains, 80.4%) (see Table S2). An additional 51 strains (2.9%)
had novel combinations of known ST alleles, whereas the remaining 296 strains (16.7%)
have novel ST alleles resulting in previously undefined ST types. After CG258 and
CG307, the three more common STs were ST16 (92 strains, 5.2%), ST15 (49 strains,
2.8%), and ST280 (32 strains, 1.8%).
Closure and annotation of five new K. pneumoniae reference genomes. Five
strains were sequenced to closure using PacBio long-read sequencing (see Table S3).
This allowed the annotation of new reference strains to aid our studies of K. pneu-
moniae population genomics and pathogenesis. The five strains were chosen to
represent regions of the phylogenetic tree for which existing reference genomes
deposited in publically available databases were lacking. In addition, genomes con-
taining the blaNDM-1 and OXA-48 genes (see below) were chosen to allow more in-depth
analysis of these important strains.
KPN11 is representative of the CG307 strains in our patient population. KPN528 was
chosen for PacBio sequencing and closure because it was the first K. pneumoniae strain
in our sample identified with the blaNDM-1 metallo-beta-lactamase. KPN1481 (ST906)
was chosen because it was one of the last strains in our sample containing the blaNDM-1
metallo-beta-lactamase gene, and a closed reference genome has not been reported
for this clonal type. Similarly, KPN1482 (ST37) is a clonal type for which a closed
reference genome is not available. BK13043, a representative CG258 strain collected in
New York City in 2004, was chosen to provide a historical CG258 reference genome.
Each new closed genome contained two to five plasmids (see Table S3). The
plasmids matched previously identified reference plasmids in GenBank with sequence
coverage ranging from 21 to 100%. The blaNDM-1 containing plasmids present in
KPN528 and KPN1481 differed. KPN528 had a 292-kb plasmid that had 99% coverage
of the pPKPN1 plasmid of reference strain PittNDM01, whereas strain KPN1481 had a

period.

 342-kb plasmid that had 74% coverage of the pNDM-MAR plasmid (41, 42). Strain
KPN528 contained a second plasmid (76 kb) with 99% coverage of plasmid 3 present
in strain PittNDM01. The PittNDM01 K. pneumoniae strain is an ST14 organism isolated
from a patient in Pittsburgh, PA, in 2013 (41). Of note, KPN528 also is an ST14 strain and
was isolated in December 2012. Taken together, these results suggest that these
Pittsburgh and Houston strains are lineally descended from a common ancestor
organism.
Strains of CG307 are unexpectedly abundant. KPC-producing K. pneumoniae
were initially described in the Houston region in 2009 (43). That initial report was
followed by the identification of multiple clonal types in 2010, including CG258 and
CG307 (10). The CG307 clade of K. pneumoniae was first identified in a Dutch teaching
hospital in 2008 (44). Since then, CG307 strains have been identified periodically in
Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Central and South America, and New York City (20,
33–40, 45–47), and a hospital-based outbreak was recently reported in South Korea
(48). However, they have not been documented to be of great abundance in any of
these areas. Thus, in our genomic data set based on comprehensive, population-based
sampling of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae strains, we demonstrate the existence of a
numerically highly successful but poorly characterized genetic group (CG307) with
disease prevalence exceeding that of the well-known epidemic CG258 organisms. We
identified no statistically significant difference between the observed in-hospital mor-
tality rate of all patients infected with CG307 strains and that of patients infected with
the CG258 clonal type (chi-square test) (Fig. 2). Similarly, the mortality rate did not differ
statistically significantly between patients with bloodstream infections caused by
CG307 and CG258 strains (chi-square test). Furthermore, no significant differences
between CG307 and CG258 strains were identified in any clinical feature (see Ta-
ble S1A), including the hospital of origin, organ transplant status, infection type (urinary
tract versus invasive infection), and number of episodes of care (single versus multiple
strains recovered longitudinally from the same patient).
Comparison of CG258 and CG307 genomes: abundant variation in gene content.
The CG258 reference genome (NJST258_2; NCBI GenBank accession no. CP006918.1)
has 5,188 annotated genes. Comparison of these genes to our assembled CG307
reference genome (KPN11) by bidirectional BLAST analysis found that 429 of the
annotated NJST258_2 genes do not have a significant homolog present in the KPN11
CG307 genome (Fig. 4). Most of these genes (253 out of 429) are annotated as
hypothetical proteins. Many of the others are associated with phage, secretion systems,
or metabolism. Of the 5,237 annotated genes in the KPN11 CG307 reference assembly,
there are 414 annotated genes that lack a homolog in NJST258_2, most of which (281
of 414) are annotated as hypothetical proteins. Most of the other genes that are missing
are associated with phage, transduction elements, or metabolism. Some of the genes
present in or absent from either clonal type are related to the capsule gene locus.
Genetic variation in this locus is well established (17, 49, 50). A summary of the
annotated genes present in or absent from NJST258_2 compared to KPN11 CG307 is
presented in Tables S4 and S5. Variations in yersiniabactin locus, antimicrobial resis-
tance gene content, and capsule locus are discussed in more detail below.
Presence of yersiniabactin and colibactin loci in ESBL-producing K. pneu-
moniae. Recent studies have emphasized the important contribution of siderophore
gene acquisition to severe Klebsiella invasive disease (51, 52). Holt et al. reported that
the yersiniabactin locus (ybt) was present in 40.0% of the CG258 and 32.2% of the
overall K. pneumoniae genomes analyzed (52). In contrast, we found that only 274 of
our 1,777 strains (15.4%) had the ybt locus. Only 13 of the 644 CG307 strains (2.0%)
and 85 of the 474 CG258 strains (17.9%) contained the ybt locus. Of the 474 CG258
strains, 76 (16.0%) had both the colibactin synthesis locus (clb) and the ybt locus. In
contrast, none of the CG307 strains carried a clb locus. The presence or absence of
the yersiniabactin and colibactin loci is shown in Fig. 2 and presented in Table S1A. In
contrast to results from other studies using smaller strain collections (51, 52), the
presence of the yersiniabactin and colibactin loci was not significantly associated with

 genes and multiple replicons. The genome data identified extensive plasmid diversity
among the 1,777 strains. The average number of plasmid replicons per isolate was 4.5
(standard deviation, 2.5; range, 0 to 16). Six replicons were each present in more than
25% of the 1,777 strains, i.e., FIBk (1,327 strains), FIIk (1,237 strains), FII (693 strains), R
(667 strains), ColRNAI (660 strains), and FIBpQil (494 strains).
The distribution of the replicons across the phylogenetic tree is shown in Fig. S1 and
Table S1C. The FIBk and FIIk replicons are present in strains of diverse clonal back-
grounds, with some clustering in CG307 organisms. The FII, ColRNAI, and FIBpQiL
replicons appear to cluster predominantly with CC258 strains, whereas the R replicons
are associated with the CG307 organisms. The most common combination of replicons
in a single isolate was FIBk, FII, ColRNAI, and FIBpQil (248 strains), followed closely by
FII and FIBpQil (244 strains) and FIBk and FIBpQiL (228 strains). The only replicon of the
top six to be found in the absence of any of the other five was FIBpQiL (177 strains).
Diversity of ESBL genes. Our analysis identified an extensive array of ESBL genes
in the 1,777 genomes, including those encoding carbapenemases. Genes in the SHV-
LEN-OKP family of ESBLs were most common, being present in 1,442 of the 1,777
strains. The second most common ESBL gene was blaCTX-M, which was present in 1,161
of 1,777 strains (see Table S1B). Among the eight blaCTX-M alleles identified, blaCTX-M-15,
was the most abundant. Other ESBL-encoding genes identified included a member of
the TEM family (797 strains) and the KPC gene (581 strains). OXA genes characterized
as encoding ESBLs (OXA-23, OXA-24, OXA-48, and OXA-83) were far less common,
being present in only 23 strains. blaNDM-1-positive strains were cultured from six
patients, two of whom had strains that also had the OXA-48 gene. Some of the
antimicrobial resistance genes detected in these strains, such as TEM30, TEM33, and
SHV26, are known to be inhibitor resistant.
Overall, KPC alleles were present in 64.6% of the CG258 strains (306 strains)
compared to 34.3% of the CG307 strains (221 strains). Among all of our strains with a
blaKPC carbapenemase gene (581 strains), blaKPC-2 was the dominant allele (572 strains,
98.4%), including 293 CG258 strains (96.4%) and 197 CG307 strains (93.4%). Our results
differ from those of other studies reporting that both blaKPC-2 and blaKPC-3 are found in
CG258 K. pneumoniae (10, 13, 17, 20, 45, 53) and that CG307 was strongly associated
with blaKPC-3 (39). CG307 strains expressing blaKPC-2 have been recently reported in
Korea and Colombia (34–36). In our sample, no CG258 strains and only three CG307
strains had the blaKPC-3 allele. The difference between blaKPC-2 and blaKPC-3 is one
nonsynonymous SNP (C814T) that results in an H272Y amino acid replacement.
Whereas both blaKPC-2 and blaKPC-3 are very efficient at hydrolyzing penicillins, cepha-
losporins, and carbapenems, blaKPC-3 has increased enzymatic activity against and
confers higher resistance to cephamycins and ceftazidime (15).
Four newer KPC variants (blaKPC-7, blaKPC-8, blaKPC-9, and blaKPC-10) likely derived from
blaKPC-3 have a second nonsynonymous SNP that confers greater catalytic activity
against ceftazidime than blaKPC-2 (54). That is, the use of ceftazidime worldwide may be
selecting for KPC variants with increasing levels of resistance. Of these newer blaKPC
variants, there are four CG258 strains in our collection with blaKPC-8. Although the
reason for the predominance and persistence of blaKPC-2 in our hospital system is
unclear, it may be related in part to the relatively conservative use of ceftazidime and
ceftazidime-avibactam compared to other beta-lactam antibiotics. The potential for a
shift from a CG258-centered K. pneumoniae epidemic to a polyclonal epidemic was first
reported in Italy in 2014, and concern has been raised in Korea (33–36).
Analysis of blaNDM-1-carrying patient strains suggests horizontal transfer of a
blaNDM-1-containing plasmid from a classic Indian blaNDM-1-positive clone into the
Houston CG307 population. The identification of the gene encoding New Delhi
metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (blaNDM-1) in our patient strains is concerning because that
enzyme confers very broad resistance to nearly all beta-lactam antibiotics and can
be readily transferred between strains by plasmids. Since its discovery in 2009, the
blaNDM-1 gene has spread globally among members of the family Enterobacteriaceae;
however, the number of reported human infections remains relatively low. As of

 6 January 2017, only 175 cases have been reported in the United States, including 2 in
Texas (https://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/cre/TrackingCRE.html). To identify strains
with blaNDM-1 in our strain sample, assembled contigs were mapped to a custom
database of all published blaNDM-1-bearing plasmids. We identified 15 strains from six
patients with the blaNDM-1 gene (Table 2; see Fig. S2). All contigs containing the
blaNDM-1 gene are 100% identical to published plasmid sequences, indicating that no
novel blaNDM-1 sequences have been introduced into or evolved de novo in Houston
patients. Contigs from three strains were identical. Consistent with the idea that strains
with the blaNDM-1 gene were imported to Houston, the majority of the blaNDM-1-
containing strains belong to ST14 and ST37, two STs endemic in India, Pakistan, and
elsewhere in southern Asia (55). Unexpectedly, the blaNDM-1 gene was detected in one
CG307 strain. It is possible that this strain acquired the blaNDM-1 plasmid while circu-
lating locally in Houston. Consistent with this idea, the blaNDM-1-containing plasmid in
our CG307 strain (Table 2, patient F) is closely similar to a blaNDM-1-containing plasmid
in two Houston patients (Table 2, patients A and B).
Extensive diversity in the capsule locus. K. pneumoniae capsule is an important
virulence factor, and the capsule synthesis locus has considerable diversity in gene
content between clonal groups (17, 49–51). Diverse associations among different wzi
genotypes, blaKPC genotypes, and STs have been reported, and some clonal groupings
have been identified (45, 53). Recently, Holt et al. (44) proposed a new nomenclature
for capsule locus genotyping (KL type) that encompasses the diversity of the known
locus and described a software tool (Kaptive) for capsule locus genotyping. Using
Kaptive, we identified 72 unique KL capsule locus types and potential novel variants
(see Table S1A). The two most common KL capsule locus types among CG258 strains
were KL106 (n � 259) and KL107 (n � 117). KL107 has the wzi154 gene allele. Although
previous studies reported that the wzi154 allele in CG258 strains was associated with
the blaKPC-3 gene, this was not the case in our strain sample. We found that almost all
of our CG258 strains with a KPC gene contain blaKPC-2. The CG307 strains we studied
had less diversity in the capsule locus. We found that 524 of 526 strains had the KL102
capsule locus, including all 119 ST307 strains with the blaKPC-2 gene.
In general, a given clonal group had a predominant KL capsule locus type, although
some exceptions were observed (see Table S1A). CG258 is notable for having two
capsule gene loci common in the group. Other clonal types with notable capsule locus
diversity include ST15 (49 strains, four KL capsule locus types) and ST37 (18 strains,
eight KL capsule locus types).
K. pneumoniae clinical strains recovered over time from the same patient. Many
Houston Methodist patients (n � 357) had two or more K. pneumoniae strains cultured
from different specimens, in some cases more than 3 years apart (Fig. 5). To investigate
whether these different episodes in the same patient represent infections caused by

 the same or a different clone, we used the whole-genome sequence data to determine
the relatedness of the organisms recovered. For this analysis, a second episode was
defined as a strain isolated more than 35 days after the prior infection event. The
�35-day-criterion was selected by using the Infectious Diseases Society of America
definition of a late cure of cystitis (cystitis was the most common infection type in our
collection) (56). Of the 196 patients with multiple strains recovered in different epi-
sodes, we found that 42 (21.4%) were infected with different clones during the study
period (Fig. 5A). Similarly, 10 patients had two genomically distinct strains recovered on
the same day (Fig. 5B). Consistent with the hypothesis that CG307 strains are as virulent
and able to cause recurrent or chronic infections as CG258 strains, the frequency of
CG307 and CG258 strains recovered from patients with multiple episodes did not differ
significantly (Fisher exact test, no statistically significant difference). Of note, no simple
pattern of change in capsule locus or antimicrobial resistance genes was identified
among the multiple-episode patients.
Extensive transcriptome diversity among and within clades. Whole-genome
phylogenetic analysis revealed that the ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae strains causing
infections in our health care system could be broadly classified into three major genetic
clades. To begin investigating the effect of the extensive genomic diversity on global
gene expression, 10 rationally selected strains were analyzed by genome-wide tran-
scriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. The 10 strains were selected to broadly
represent the overall population structure, including the year of collection, phage
content, antimicrobial resistance gene content, and numerical dominance of CG (see
Table S6). Given the extensive genomic variation present, we hypothesized that each
strain would have a unique transcriptome. The 10 strains had nearly superimposable
growth curves, suggesting that observed differences in global transcriptome were
attributable to genetic differences among strains rather than growth characteristics
(Fig. 6A).
Transcript libraries were prepared by standard methods and sequenced to very
deep coverage (mean, 22.2 [range, 14.8 to 33.6] million reads per replicate) to minimize
the false discovery of significantly altered gene expression. Transcripts were counted
relative to CG258 reference strain NJST258_2. Consistent with our hypothesis, principal-
component analysis showed differences in the transcriptomes of these strains, both
within and between the CGs (Fig. 6B). On average, each strain differentially expressed
427 genes compared to the reference strain (Fig. 6C). In the aggregate, the maximum
number of differentially expressed genes was 617, indicative of the substantial diversity
in these strains (Fig. 6D). Also consistent with gene content differences identified
among the 10 strains, approximately half of the reads for each strain did not map to the
NJST258_2 reference chromosome (mean, 46.3% reads unmapped per duplicate strain
pair; range, 42.2 to 53.5%). BLAST analysis revealed that most unmapped reads derived
from plasmid-borne genes, insertion sequences, and other mobile elements. Similar

 results were generated when reads were mapped to CG307 strain KPN11 (see Fig. S3A)
or CG14 strain KPN528 (see Fig. S3B). Also, the RNA-Seq data confirmed expression of
the genes encoding NDM-1, OXA-48, KPC, and yersiniabactin by strains carrying these
genes (Table 2; see Fig. S3C to F and Table S6). That is, among these 10 strains, mobile
gene content contributed to nearly half of all differentially expressed gene transcripts.
After accounting for differences in gene content, we identified no simple patterns of
transcriptome differences, either within or between the CGs.
Mouse model of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae pneumonia. A very unexpected
finding from the whole-genome sequence data was that CG307 organisms were very
abundant among the ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae strains recovered from patients in
our Houston Methodist Hospitals. To test the hypothesis that CG307 strains are as
virulent as the globally disseminated and numerically common CG258 clone, refer-
ence strains KPN1411 (CG307) and KPN113 (CG258) were compared using a mouse
model of pneumonia. Mice were inoculated by intranasal instillation and necropsied at
24 h, and the numbers of CFU recovered from the infection site (lung) and a site of
dissemination (spleen) were determined. CFU were recovered from the lungs of all of
the mice. There was no significant difference in the number of CFU cultured from
the lungs of mice infected with CG307 strain KPN1411 and CG258 strain KPN113
(mean, 1.22 � 105 CFU for KPN1411 compared to 8.98 � 104 CFU for KPN113; data
not shown). Similarly, there was no significant difference in dissemination to the

 spleen (four of five mice for KPN1411 compared to three of five mice for KPN113;
data not shown).
To further investigate host-pathogen interactions, the host immune response was
examined in infected mice. Mice were inoculated by intranasal instillation, monitored
for 7 days, and sacrificed, and flow cytometry analysis of immune cells recovered from
their lungs and spleens was conducted (Fig. 7). Compared with uninfected control mice,
animals infected with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae had significantly more total
CD45� leukocytes in their lungs, including neutrophils (9.04-fold; Fig. 7A), monocytes
(4.06-fold; Fig. 7B), T cells (2.63-fold; Fig. 7C), and �� T cells (25.21-fold; Fig. 7D). There
was no significant difference in the numbers of B lymphocytes or alveolar macrophages
(Fig. 7E and F). K. pneumoniae-infected lungs also had significantly more �� and CD4 T
cells expressing IL-17 (9.50- and 12.07-fold, respectively, Fig. 7G and H). However,
compared to the CG258 strain, the CG307 strain elicited a significantly smaller fraction
of IL-17-producing �� T cells (Fig. 7I). IL-17-expressing CD4� T cells were also increased
in the spleens of K. pneumoniae-infected animals, likely representing a reservoir of
proliferating reactivated memory cells (4.78-fold; Fig. 7J). Taken together, the mouse
pneumonia data demonstrate that the CG307 reference strain was as virulent as the
epidemic CG258 reference strain in this disease model.
Prediction of resistance to antimicrobial agents based on whole-genome se-
quence data. The large number of genome sequences generated for this study of
drug-resistant organisms gave us the opportunity to use machine learning-based
classifiers to predict resistance to antimicrobial agents. To test the ability to use
whole-genome sequence data to predict antimicrobial resistance phenotypes, we used
the AdaBoost algorithm (57, 58) to generate classifiers for 16 agents commonly used to
treat human K. pneumoniae infections. Results of the classifier prediction strongly
correlated with the clinical phenotype, as measured by the area under the curve (AUC)
and the F1 score (Fig. 8). Importantly, the prediction data generated the three highest
scores for the carbapenem antibiotics.
DISCUSSION
In the aggregate, our data demonstrate that ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae strains
causing infections in our large hospital system over several years have substantial
genomic diversity. Analysis of large, comprehensive, population-based strain samples

 can assist our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of these organisms and
thereby contribute to enhanced translational research.
We identified the heretofore unrecognized numerical success of CG307 strains in the
Houston region (Fig. 1). CG307 strains caused more infections than the pandemic
CG258 strains throughout the study period (Fig. 3). We confirmed that CG307 strains
continue to be an abundant cause of infections in our hospital system by sequencing
an additional 96 ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae strains recovered in 2017 (S. W. Long,
unpublished data). Although CG307 strains have been previously identified in our area,
the extent to which this clonal type has successfully coexisted with CG258 to achieve
a state of codominance in our region was a very unexpected discovery. The reason(s)
the CG307 clone has become abundant in Houston but not other parts of North
America is not understood. CG307 strains have not been reported previously to be a
prominent cause of infections in a large, unbiased population over a multiyear period.
The relatively recent success of CG307 progeny in Italy and Korea has caused alarm (33,
34, 36, 47). By all measures, including the in-hospital mortality rate, the CG307 strains
causing infections in Houston appear to be as virulent as CG258 strains. Over the
45-month course of our study, the incidence of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae steadily
increased from approximately 18 to 28 strains recovered per month (Fig. 3). There was
no preferential increase in CG258 or CG307 strains compared to other ST types during
the study period. This increasing incidence mirrors a trend reported elsewhere and
stresses the detrimental impact of multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae on human health.
The use of whole-genome sequence data to infer antimicrobial resistance pheno-
types is an area of intense interest (59, 60). Two very different approaches have been
pursued. The most common strategy attempts to predict phenotypes by identifying the
presence or absence of genes and gene mutations conferring antimicrobial resistance
(61). Although modestly successful, this strategy has two major disadvantages. First, it
requires the curation of a comprehensive database that is updated as new discoveries
are made. Second, this strategy is likely to fail to accurately predict resistance if
the molecular mechanism is multifactorial or unknown. Since this study provides a
very large, well-annotated data set, we sought an alternative approach using machine
learning-based classifiers to predict antimicrobial resistance (Fig. 8). We have recently
used this method to build accurate predictors of antimicrobial resistance phenotypes
for several important human pathogens, including Acinetobacter baumannii, Mycobac-
terium tuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (62). Machine

 learning approaches are advantageous because they require no a priori knowledge of
the underlying molecular mechanism of resistance and may potentially identify new
antimicrobial resistance-related genomic features. The results of this study suggest that
for many antibiotics, it may be possible to build diagnostically valid classifiers for
the prediction of antimicrobial resistance directly from the genome sequence data.
Paired with new rapid sequencing technologies, these classifiers could provide clini-
cally actionable data (63). We also attempted to build classifiers for the prediction of
other clinical phenotypes. No classifiers could be generated to accurately predict the
site of infection, length of stay, chronic or repeated infection, or death. The lack of
predictive classifiers for these clinical phenotypes may reflect the extensive genomic
and transcriptomic diversity present in the Houston strains or the complex comorbidi-
ties present in patients with K. pneumoniae infections.
Our data from the mouse model of pneumonia demonstrated that the host immune
response to K. pneumoniae is multifaceted. We found a significant infiltration of
neutrophils, monocytes, and T cells in infected lungs. We also detected IL-17 produc-
tion by two different T-cell subsets, CD4� and �� T cells. IL-17 is well known to play a
key role in innate immunity to extracellular pathogens, particularly in patients with
chronic disease or immune compromise. Chen et al. recently reported that IL-17
secretion by CD4� T cells provided protection against eight strains of K. pneumoniae
belonging to three different capsular serotypes (STs not reported) recovered from
patients in Southeast Asia, an area where very few CG307 strains have been reported
(64). Herein, we are the first to suggest that IL-17 production by �� T cells may also
contribute to immunity to K. pneumoniae. Compared to the globally pandemic CG258
strain, the locally prominent CG307 strain elicited a significantly diminished IL-17
response by �� T cells. In addition, the lack of a yersiniabactin locus in the great
majority of CG307 strains may, in part, be related to this diminished IL-17 production.
Nearly all K. pneumoniae produce their own siderophore, enterobactin, that binds iron
in the body (52). Enterobactin is susceptible to inactivation by lipocalin 2 (Lnc2), which
also stimulates an inflammatory response (65). K. pneumoniae may acquire the yersini-
abactin locus to produce a siderophore that does not bind Lnc2, providing a survival
benefit in exchange for the energy required to express yersiniabactin (52, 66). By
limiting IL-17 production in the immune response, CG307 K. pneumoniae may be
enhancing the effectiveness of the enterobactin siderophore system, negating the need
for yersiniabactin loci in CG307 organisms for survival and success in the host. These
discoveries provide one potential explanation for the numerical success of CG307
strains among patients in Houston. That is, the CG307 clone circulating in Houston,
through an undetermined genomic or transcriptomic mechanism, may elicit a different
innate immune response than CG258 strains. Additional studies are under way to
investigate this idea.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Strain sample. Strains were cultured from patient specimens submitted to the Diagnostic Microbi-
ology Laboratory at Houston Methodist Hospital between September 2011 and May 2015. The Diag-
nostic Microbiology Laboratory serves as the central diagnostic laboratory for the 2,000-bed Houston
Methodist Hospital system. Strains were collected by the research team after routine microbiology
diagnostics were completed. All of the strains collected were ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, as deter-
mined by automated methods (Phoenix ESBL test; BD). A summary of the isolate collection dates and
sources is provided in Table S1A. Strains were collected and patient data were examined under human
subjects protocol IRB1010-0199 as approved by the Institutional Review Board, Houston Methodist
Research Institute.
DNA extraction and whole-genome sequencing. Genomic and plasmid DNA was extracted in
accordance with the Gram-negative protocol of the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen). DNA was
quantitated with the Qubit (Invitrogen) instrument, and whole-genome sequencing libraries were
prepared with NexteraXT reagents (Illumina). Libraries were sequenced with Illumina MiSeq and NextSeq
500 instruments.
Bioinformatic analysis. Initial bioinformatic analysis was performed on the high-performance
computer cluster in the Houston Methodist Research Institute, a Beowulf cluster with 336 CPU cores and
1.8 TB of RAM. FASTQ files were processed with Trimmomatic (v 0.35) to remove adapter sequence
contamination and Musket (v 1.1) to correct short-read sequence errors (67, 68). SMALT (v 0.7.6) was used
to align reads, and FreeBayes (v 0.9.20) was used to identify variants (69). The in-house-developed scripts

 prephix and phrecon were used to generate multi-FASTA files of SNPs for phylogenetic tree generation
(https://github.com/codinghedgehog/). Phylogenetic trees were generated with FastTreeMP (v 2.1.8)
using double precision and annotated with CLC Genomics workbench 9.5.2 (Qiagen) (70). Short-read
sequence typing for bacterial pathogens (SRST2) (71) was used to identify the MLST assignment of each
strain with the K. pneumoniae database of 2,470 STs available on 4 November 2016 curated at the Institut
Pasteur (http://bigsdb.web.pasteur.fr/klebsiella/). SRST2 was also used to identify antibiotic resistance
gene content and plasmid replicon content by using the SRST2 gene database files ARGannot.r1.fasta
and PlasmidFinder.fasta. Reads were assembled into contigs with SPAdes v.3.6.2 (72). Kaptive was used
to identify the capsule locus genotype and capsule locus gene content from assembled contigs (50).
Kleborate was used to identify yersiniabactin, colibactin, and other siderophore locus content from
assembled contigs (52). MEGA7 and MEGA-CC were used to generate distance matrices for pairwise
distance analysis (73, 74). Gene content analysis was performed with the Proteome Comparison tool in
PATRIC (75).
Pacific Biosciences genome sequence data. Strains were sequenced to closure by the Pacific
Biosciences SMRT long-read strategy in the laboratory of C. Mason at Weill Cornell Medical College. This
technology permitted closed assembly of the core chromosome and plasmid DNA sequences from the
target strains. Polished contigs were generated with HGAP. The plasmid sequences were compared to
the NT database at NCBI with BLAST.
Genome-wide RNA transcript analysis. RNA-Seq analysis was conducted as previously described
(76). Briefly, 10 strains were selected to be broadly representative of our population, on the basis of the
year of collection, phage type, CRE type, blaNDM-1 type, and numerical dominance of CGs (see Table S6).
Two of these 10 strains were previously sequenced to closure (17), and 1 was sequenced to closure in
this study with PacBio as described above. Duplicate cultures of each strain were inoculated into prewarmed
LB medium and grown at 37°
C to the mid-exponential phase (optical density at 600 nm [OD600] of 0.60 to
0.65). Total RNA was extracted with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’
s instructions, and
RNA-seq libraries were prepared with an Epicenter ScriptSeq kit (Illumina). The libraries were sequenced by
using a 75-bp single-end protocol with a high-output v 3 reagent kit (Illumina). To generate a sufficient
number of sequence reads for transcript analysis (average of 12 million reads per library), two runs were
performed with one MiSeq instrument at the default software settings for the Generate FASTQ on
instrument workflow. The two FASTQ files generated for each library were concatenated, and the number
and quality of sequence reads were determined with FastQC (Babraham Bioscience Technologies,
Cambridge, United Kingdom). The RNA transcripts were quantified from the concatenated FASTQ files
with the default software settings relative to the chromosome of strain BK30684 with CLC Genomics
Workbench v 9.5.2 (Qiagen). Differences of �1.5-fold by Baggerly’
s test and a P value of �0.05 after
applying Bonferroni’
s correction for multiple comparisons were considered significant. Strain BK30684
was selected as the chromosome reference because the genome has been sequenced to closure, it is
genetically representative of the globally disseminated CG258 clone, and it has been used in previous
pathogenomic studies (17). To confirm that the many differences in gene expression observed between
strains were due to differences in gene content, RNA-Seq reads were also mapped to CG307 reference
strain KPN11 and CG14 reference strain KPN528 (see Table S3). To confirm expression of the KPC gene,
reads were mapped to reference plasmid pNFST258C2 (GenBank accession no. CP006919.1). To confirm
expression of the blaNDM-1 and OXA48 genes, reads were mapped to reference plasmids pPKPN1
(GenBank accession no. CP006799.1) and pKP112 (GenBank accession no. LN864819.1).
Mouse model of pneumonia. A mouse model of pneumonia was used to compare the virulence of
reference CG307 and CG258 strains KPN1411 and KPN113, respectively. C57BL/6 mice were inoculated by
intranasal instillation of 1 � 108 CFU in 30 �l (15 �l in each naris). At 24 h postinoculation, mice were
sacrificed. The lungs and spleens were removed, homogenized (Omni), serially diluted in sterile phosphate-
buffered saline, plated on tryptic soy agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood, and incubated overnight at
37 C. CFU were counted, graphed as the mean � the standard error of the mean, and statistically
compared by using the Mann-Whitney test (GraphPad). Similarly, mice were infected and sacrificed after
7 days and their lungs were harvested for flow cytometry analysis by standard methods (77).
Preparation of genomic data for antimicrobial resistance prediction. Antimicrobial susceptibility
testing for each strain was performed as part of the routine clinical workup. Machine learning-based
classifiers for antimicrobial resistance phenotype prediction were created as previously described (62), by
using the genomic data and clinical antimicrobial susceptibility data generated in this study. Briefly, the
1,777 genomes were assembled by using the PATRIC Full SPAdes assembly strategy and annotated by
using the PATRIC annotation service (75). For each antimicrobial agent, the genomes were evenly divided
into resistant and susceptible sets, matrices were built with 15-bp k-mers, and 10 iterative rounds of the
AdaBoost algorithm were performed. Tenfold cross validation was applied to the data set for each
classifier (62). The final set of classifiers generated for each antimicrobial agent is accessible in the PATRIC
and RAST annotation services.
Accession number(s). The whole genome sequence FASTQ files, RNAseq FASTQ files, and genomes
of the strains sequenced by PacBio (see Table S3) have been deposited in the NCBI database under
BioProject no. PRJNA376414.
