SUMMARY
Hippocampal dentate gyrus is a focus of enhanced neurogenesis and excitability after traumatic brain injury. Increased neurogenesis has
been proposed to aid repair of the injured network. Our data show that an early increase in neurogenesis after fluid percussion concussive
brain injury is transient and is followed by a persistent decrease compared with age-matched controls. Post-injury changes in neurogen-
esis paralleled changes in neural precursor cell proliferation and resulted in a long-term decline in neurogenic capacity. Targeted pharma-
cology to restore post-injury neurogenesis to control levels reversed the long-term decline in neurogenic capacity. Limiting post-injury
neurogenesis reduced early increases in dentate excitability and seizure susceptibility. Our results challenge the assumption that
increased neurogenesis after brain injury is beneficial and show that early post-traumatic increases in neurogenesis adversely affect
long-term outcomes by exhausting neurogenic potential and enhancing epileptogenesis. Treatments aimed at limiting excessive neuro-
genesis can potentially restore neuroproliferative capacity and limit epilepsy after brain injury.
INTRODUCTION
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a growing epidemic with
significant long-term neurocognitive disorders including
impaired memory processing and epilepsy (Pitkanen et al.,
2014). TBI is characterized by several cellular and circuit
changes (Atkins, 2011; Cohen et al., 2007), which shape
the long-term neurological sequelae (Herman, 2002). In
addition to the well-documented dentate neuronal loss
(Gupta et al., 2012; Neuberger et al., 2014), there is an
increase in the generation of new neurons in the dentate gy-
rus within days after TBI (Dash et al., 2001; Kernie and
Parent,2010; Yuetal.,2008).How thesenewlybornneurons
modify functional outcomes after brain injury is not fully
understood.
The subgranular zone of the adult dentate gyrus has been
proposed as a niche region for neural stem cells that sup-
ports constitutive neurogenesis throughout postnatal life.
However, the rate of neurogenesis can be altered physio-
logically with aging and in disease such as temporal lobe
epilepsy, TBI, ischemia, and stroke (Connor, 2012). Since
dentate neurogenesis is proposed to replace lost neurons
(Yu et al., 2008), the increase in neurogenesis after TBI
may promote recovery (Sun et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2016b).
However, a rapid expansion of stem cell populations in
certain pathological conditions can deplete stem cells
(Jacob and Osato, 2009) due to cell death, fate change, or
cellular senescence (Artegiani and Calegari, 2012). Thus
an expansion in neurogenesis could paradoxically deplete
neural precursor cell populations over time and limit the
normal capacity to replace damaged cells and repair the
network. Whether the post-injury increase in neurogenesis
is sustained or undermines the long-term capacity for neu-
rogenesis remains to be examined.
While prior studies have examined outcomes after
ablating both normal and injury-induced neurogenesis
(Blaiss et al., 2011), targeting mechanisms that augment
neurogenesis after injury is a promising strategy to examine
the consequence of excess neurogenesis without elimi-
nating physiological neurogenesis. In the adult dentate,
vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), acting
through VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) localized in neural pre-
cursor cells (Kirby et al., 2015; Segi-Nishida et al., 2008), has
been shown to increase proliferation, survival, and integra-
tion of newborn neurons (Louissaint et al., 2002; Shen et al.,
2004). Recent studies have identified increased VEGF-A
levels after TBI and demonstrated that blocking VEGFR2
signaling reduces post-injury increases in neurogenesis
(Lu et al., 2011; Shore et al., 2004). Thus, VEGFR2 could
be targeted to limit enhanced post-traumatic neurogenesis
without eliminating physiological neurogenesis.
Apart from effects on neurogenic capacity, whether
excessive neurogenesis after TBI may contribute to lasting
pathology is an open question. In experimental epi-
lepsy, a population of granule cells born after seizures
gives rise to aberrant connections, which could increase
network excitability and promote epilepsy (Cha et al.,
2004; Parent et al., 1997). Development of epilepsy after
a latent period is a major consequence of brain injury,
raising the possibility that post-injury increase in neuro-
genesis may render the hippocampus more excitable
and susceptible to seizures. By systematically evaluating

test the prevailing assumption that increased neurogene-
sis after TBI is beneficial.
RESULTS
Transient Increase in Neurogenesis after TBI is
Followed by Long-Term Decline
Immature granule cells (IGCs) expressing doublecortin
(DCX) are known to increase within days after brain injury
(Kernie and Parent, 2010; Sun et al., 2007). We determined
whether this increase is sustained by systematically quanti-
fying DCX-expressing IGCs 3, 7, 30, and 90 days after
fluid percussion injury (FPI) and sham injury. Consistent
with previous studies, IGCs on the injured side almost
doubled 3 days after injury (Figure 1E; DCX cells/section,
sham: 370 ± 22; FPI: 638 ± 59; n = 4 rats, p < 0.05) while
IGCs on the uninjured contralateral side were unchanged
(Figure S1A). However, IGC counts were significantly
reduced (Figures 1C–1E) 30 days after FPI and were less
than half that of age-matched sham controls 90 days after
injury (Figure 1E; DCX cells/section, sham: 225 ± 32, n = 4
rats; FPI: 96 ± 2, n = 5 rats; p < 0.05). The data demonstrate
that despite early increases 3–7 days post FPI, neurogenesis
in the injured dentate declines by 30 days. These findings
raise the possibility of a progressive loss of IGCs and neural
progenitor cells or an exhaustion of NPC proliferative ca-
pacity after brain injury.
Altered NPC Proliferation Drives Post-injury Changes
in Neurogenesis
We sought to determine whether the biphasic post-trau-
matic changes in IGC numbers resulted from progressive

 changes in NPC proliferation or early accumulation
of maturation-incompetent IGCs followed by enhanced
degeneration. Hippocampal sections from rats 3 and
90 days after FPI and sham injury were labeled for Tbr2
(T-box brain protein 2), a marker for NPCs, and Ki67 ex-
pressed in proliferating cells. Both the total number of
Tbr2-positive NPCs and Ki67-expressing proliferating cells
were increased 3 days after injury (Figures 2A–2D, S2A, and
S2B; Tbr2+ cells/section, sham: 206 ± 5, n = 4 rats; FPI: 339 ±
10, n = 5 rats; p < 0.05; Ki67+ cells/section, sham: 98 ± 5,
n = 4 rats; FPI: 204 ± 4, n = 5 rats; p < 0.05). The proportion
of NPCs co-labeled for Ki67 increased 3 days after FPI,
indicating enhanced NPC proliferation (Figure 2E; %

p = 0.024; time: F(1, 14) = 742.891; p < 0.001) and proliferation (injury: F(1, 14) = 60.263; p < 0.001; time: F(1, 14) = 902.173; p < 0.001).
Interaction between injury and time was also significant for both NPCs (F(1, 14) = 346.370; p < 0.001) and proliferation (F(1, 14) = 422.151;

 decreased 90 days post injury (Figures 2C and 2D; Tbr2+
cells/section, sham: 152 ± 5, n = 4 rats; FPI: 52 ± 1, n = 5
rats; p < 0.05; Ki67+ cells/section, sham: 63 ± 3, n = 4 rats;
FPI: 15 ± 2, n = 5 rats; p < 0.05). Crucially, the percentage
of proliferating NPCs was significantly reduced 90 days
post injury (Figure 2E; %NPCs expressing Ki67, sham:
44.4% ± 3.4%, n = 4 rats; FPI: 32.4% ± 4.4%, n = 5 rats;
p < 0.05). Examination of type I neural stem cells, co-
labeled for Sox-2, a marker for type 1 and type 2 stem cells,
and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for type I
neural stem cells, revealed no differences between groups at
3 or 90 days (Figures 2F–2H; Sox2/GFAP+ cells/section,
3 days: sham: 96 ± 4, FPI: 104 ± 7; p > 0.05; 90 days:
sham: 79 ± 3, FPI: 85 ± 4, n = 4 rats each; p > 0.05). There
was, however, significant reduction in type I stem cells
between 3 and 90 days, which is consistent with a decline
in stem cells with age. Overall, the type I stem cells were
unchanged and the proportion of proliferating NPCs
increased to 62.4% ± 3.6% 3 days after FPI and declined
to 32.4% ± 4.4% at 90 days while proliferation levels in
controls was unchanged, suggesting that changes in NPC
proliferation rates may underlie the biphasic alterations
in neurogenesis after TBI.
Newborn Neurons Generated after TBI Survive and
Mature into Granule Cells
We
examined
whether
progressive
degenerative
loss
could contribute to long-term decline in IGC numbers after
FPI. Although we have demonstrated dentate neuronal
degeneration 4 hrs after FPI (Neuberger et al., 2014), Flu-
oro-Jade C staining of sections 3, 7, 30, and 90 days after
FPI failed to reveal degenerating cells (data not shown,
n = 3 rats/group/time point). Similarly, the number of
TUNEL-stained apoptotic cells in the subgranular zone
did not differ between sham and FPI groups at 3 and
7 days (Figures S3A and S3B). Thus, IGC or NPC degenera-
tion is unlikely to underlie a decline in IGCs after FPI.
To determine the fate of IGCs born early after FPI, we
pulse-labeled proliferating NPCs with bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdU) 0–4 days after injury and quantified their survival
and maturation 45 days post injury (Figure S4A). Sections
from rats sacrificed 45 days after FPI showed more BrdU-
positive profiles than shams, indicating that IGCs born af-
ter injury survive. Co-labeling for BrdU and Prox-1, a
marker for mature granule cells, identified a 64% increase
in co-labeled cellular profiles after FPI compared with
shams, demonstrating that proliferating cells born after
injury mature into granule cells (Figures S4B–S4D). While
not all hilar BrdU cells expressed Prox-1, all BrdU-labeled
cells in the granule cell layer expressed Prox-1 and a major-
ity were located in the inner third of the granule cell layer.
Unlike observations in experimental epilepsy (Parent et al.,
1997), BrdU-Prox-1 co-labeled cells were not present in
ectopic locations including the hilus. These data indicate
that the increase in IGCs early after injury results in mature
neurons, which survive and integrate into the granule cell
layer.
VEGFR2 Antagonist Eliminates Early Increases in
Neurogenesis after TBI
The biphasic change in post-traumatic neurogenesis is
reminiscent of stem cell exhaustion observed in hemato-
logical pathologies (Jacob and Osato, 2009) whereby there
is a causal association between increased NPC proliferation
and subsequent decline. To assess whether post-traumatic
neurogenesis follows a similar trend, we sought to reduce
injury-induced increases in neurogenesis without ablating
NPCs or suppressing physiological neurogenesis. It has
been shown that increases in VEGF-A acting through its
receptor VEGFR2, selectively expressed in dentate neural
stem and precursor cells (Kirby et al., 2015), regulates neu-
rogenesis after TBI and that VEGFR2 antagonists suppress
neurogenesis after TBI (Lu et al., 2011). Therefore, we
tested whether the selective VEGFR2 antagonist, SU1498
(5 mg/mL; 2-mL bolus intracerebroventricularly [ICV], 2 hr
post injury) (Lu et al., 2011) could reduce FPI-induced neu-
rogenesis to control levels. SU1498- and vehicle-treated
rats were sacrificed 3 days after FPI to quantify DCX expres-
sion (Figure 3A). SU1498 reduced neurogenesis in both
sham (Figure 3B; DCX cells/section, sham: 375 ± 27, n =
4 rats; sham-SU1498: 245 ± 6, n = 4 rats; p < 0.05) and
FPI rats (Figure 3B; DCX cells/section, FPI: 643 ± 20, n = 4
rats; FPI-SU1498: 399 ± 5, n = 5 rats; p < 0.05). IGC counts
in vehicle-treated FPI rats were not different from those in
untreated FPI rats (Figure 3B; DCX cells/section, FPI-
DMSO: 623 ± 19, n = 3 rats; FPI: 643 ± 20, n = 4 rats; p >
0.05). Importantly, VEGFR2 antagonist returned FPI-
induced neurogenesis at 3 days post injury to levels compa-
rable with untreated sham controls (Figure 3B; DCX cells/
section, sham: 375 ± 27, n = 4 rats; FPI-SU1498: 399 ± 5,
n = 5 rats; p > 0.05). SU1498 also reduced post-FPI neuro-
genesis compared with both untreated and vehicle-treated
FPI (Figure 3B; DCX cells/section, FPI: 643 ± 20, n = 4 rats;
FPI-DMSO: 623 ± 19, n = 3 rats; FPI-SU1498: 399 ± 10, n =
5 rats; p < 0.05). Immunostaining for Tbr2 and Ki67 re-
vealed that blocking VEGFR2 restores NPC proliferation
rates 3 days post injury to levels comparable with untreated
shams (Figure 3C; Tbr2/Ki67+ cells/section, sham: 97 ± 5;
FPI-SU1498: 107 ± 7; n = 4 rats each; p > 0.05). As with
injury, SU1498 treatment did not alter neurogenesis in
the contralateral dentate (Figure S1A). These data suggest
that VEGF-A/VEGFR2 signaling contributes to the early
post-injury neurogenic burst. Although prolonged VEGFR2
antagonist infusion was shown to increase dentate neuro-
degeneration after FPI (Lee and Agoston, 2009), Fluoro-
Jade (not shown) and TUNEL labeling of sections 3 days

975
 after FPI revealed no difference between SU1498- and
vehicle-treated rats (n = 4 rats/group, Figure S3A).
Since VEGFR2 is expressed by multiple cell types (Cao
et al., 2004; Lee and Agoston, 2009), we tested the potential
for non-specific effects of VEGFR2 independent of neuro-
genesis. However, VEGFR2 treatment did not alter the
pattern of dentate hilar neuronal loss examined by Nissl
stain (Figures S5A–S5D) or astrogliosis revealed by GFAP la-
beling (Figures S5E and S5F) in sections 3 days after FPI. For
our purpose, these data demonstrate that VEGFR2 antago-
nism reduces early post-FPI neurogenesis to control levels
without increasing neurodegeneration or modifying early
hilar neuronal loss or astrogliosis, and validates the use of
SU1498 to test the causal association between the post-
FPI increase in neurogenesis and the ensuing decline.
Suppressing Post-injury Excess Neurogenesis Prevents
Long-Term Decline in Neurogenesis
Next, a cohort of SU1498- and vehicle-treated rats were
sacrificed after 90 days and examined for DCX immuno-
staining (Figure 3A). As predicted, SU1498 treatment
restored IGCs in rats 90 days after FPI to levels comparable
with age-matched controls (Figure 3D; DCX cells/section,
sham: 229 ± 15, n = 4 rats; sham-SU1498: 269 ± 32, n =
4 rats; FPI-SU1498: 234 ± 8, n = 5 rats; p > 0.05). The
number of IGCs in SU1498-treated rats 90 days after FPI
was significantly higher than in age-matched untreated
FPI rats (Figure 3D; DCX cells/section, FPI: 99 ± 4, n =
5 rats; FPI-SU1498: 234 ± 8, n = 5 rats; p < 0.05). IGCs in
vehicle-treated and untreated FPI rats were not different
at 90 days (Figure 3D; DCX cells/section, FPI: 99 ± 4, n =
5 rats; FPI-DMSO: 102 ± 3, n = 3 rats; p > 0.05 by t test).
In sections obtained 90 days post injury, labeling for Tbr2
and Ki67 demonstrated that SU1498 treatment restored
the number of proliferating NPCs to control levels (Fig-
ure 3E; TBR2/Ki67+ cells/section, sham: 56 ± 5, n = 3 rats;
FPI: 16 ± 2, n = 4 rats; FPI-SU1498: 53 ± 4, n = 4 rats; p >
0.05). In contrast, co-labeling for Sox2 and GFAP revealed
no significant effect of SU1498 on type I stem cells 3 or
90 days post TBI (Figures S1B and S1C). These data imply
that the long-term decrease in IGCs observed 30 and
90 days after FPI is a consequence of the early post-injury

 neurogenic burst and the resulting exhaustion of NPC
proliferative capacity.
Post-traumatic Decline in Neurogenic Potential is
Rescued by Limiting Early Increases in Neurogenesis
To directly evaluate the effect of injury-induced neurogen-
esis on NPC proliferative capacity, we challenged vehicle
and SU1498-treated FPI and sham rats with a subconvul-
sive dose of kainic acid (KA) (2.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally
[i.p.]) 30 days after FPI when neurogenesis is reduced. At
this dose KA increases neurogenesis, providing a measure
of NPC proliferative capacity (Sierra et al., 2015). Rats
were observed for 3 hr after injection to rule out behavioral
seizures and sacrificed 3 days after KA challenge to quantify
DCX-positive IGCs (Figure 4A). KA challenge increased
neurogenesis in untreated, vehicle-treated, and SU1498-
treated controls (Figures 4A–4F; DCX cells/section, sham:
565 ± 31, n = 3 rats; sham-DMSO: 514 ± 26, n = 3 rats;
sham-SU1498: 568 ± 34, n = 4 rats after KA versus
sham and 336 ± 22, n = 4 rats without KA). Data from un-
treated and vehicle-treated shams were not statistically
different and were combined for further analysis. As pre-
dicted, brain-injured rats challenged with KA had fewer
IGCs than shams that received the same treatments (Fig-
ure 4F; DCX cells/section, sham: 565 ± 31, n = 3 rats; FPI:
261 ± 30, n = 4 rats; p < 0.05), demonstrating that FPI
reduces the long-term neurogenic response. Importantly,
SU1498 treatment augmented the number of IGCs gener-
ated in injured rats in response to the KA challenge (Fig-
ure 4F; DCX cells/section, FPI: 261 ± 30, n = 4 rats; FPI-
SU1498: 477 ± 19, n = 4 rats; p < 0.05), restoring neurogenic
capacity to control levels. Together, these data demonstrate
that the early increase in neurogenesis after TBI results in
exhaustion of the neuroproliferative capacity and under-
lies long-term deficits in neurogenesis.
Limiting Early Post-injury Neurogenesis Reduces
Dentate Excitability and Seizure Susceptibility
Experimental FPI is known to enhance dentate network
excitability at 1 week and contribute to long-term increase
in seizure susceptibility and temporal lobe epilepsy (Gupta
et al., 2012; Kharatishvili et al., 2006). While VEGFR2
antagonist reduces early post-injury increases in neurogen-
esis, VEGFR2 signaling has been shown to acutely reduce
neuronal excitability (McCloskey et al., 2005; Sun and
Ma, 2013), raising the possibility that our treatment may
augment network excitability. To examine the effects of
the brief SU1498 treatment on excitability, we sacrificed
vehicle and SU1498-treated rats 1 week after FPI or sham
injury and examined perforant path-evoked granule cell
field responses ex vivo (Figure 5A). Consistent with earlier
studies (Neuberger et al., 2014), afferent-evoked granule
cell population spike amplitude was enhanced in vehicle-
treated FPI rats (Figures 5B and 5C; amplitude at 0.5 mV
stimulation, in mV: sham-DMSO: 0.30 ± 0.07, n = 5 rats;
FPI-DMSO: 0.73 ± 0.15, n = 5 rats; p < 0.05). Curiously, pop-
ulation spike amplitude in SU1498-treated FPI rats was
decreased compared with vehicle-treated FPI rats (Figures
5B and 5C; amplitude at 0.5 mV stimulation, in mV: FPI-
DMSO: 0.73 ± 0.15, n = 5 rats; FPI-SU1498: 0.27 ± 0.06,
n = 5 rats; p < 0.05) and were not different from sham con-
trols. Thus, the bolus VEGFR2 antagonist treatment used

 here does not enhance network excitability. Rather, it
is possible that the reduction in dentate excitability is a
consequence of previously unrecognized contribution of
enhanced neurogenesis to early post-traumatic dentate
hyperexcitability.
Brain injury can increase seizure susceptibility by a
convergence of mechanisms that are not fully understood
(Hunt et al., 2013). While increases in network excitability
could augment seizure susceptibility, enhanced neurogen-
esis in experimental epilepsy has been implicated in the
formation of abnormal circuits that promote the develop-
ment of epilepsy (Danzer, 2008). However, whether neuro-
genesis contributes to enhanced seizure susceptibility after
TBI has not been examined. Previous studies have shown
that FPI leads to spontaneous seizures after a prolonged
latent period (Kharatishvili et al., 2006) and have used
latency to chemically evoked seizures to assess risk for epi-
lepsy (Echegoyen et al., 2009). We performed video-EEG
(electroencephalographic) recordings in rats 1 month after
FPI or sham injury to determine the latency to develop
seizures following a convulsive dose of KA (5 mg/kg, i.p.).
Injured rats developed electrical seizures significantly earlier
than shams (Figures 5D–5H; latency in seconds, sham:
963.4 ± 150.1, n = 5; FPI: 153.8 ± 58.3, n = 4; p < 0.05), consis-
tent with enhanced seizure susceptibility after FPI (Eche-
goyen et al., 2009). Vehicle treatment failed to alter seizure
latency (Figures 5E–5H; latency in seconds, FPI: 153.8 ±
58.3, n = 4; FPI-DMSO: 207.7 ± 33.9, n = 3; p > 0.05 by

 t test). Although SU1498 did not alter seizure latency in
shams (Figures 5E–5H; latency in seconds, sham: 963.4 ±
150.1, n = 5; sham-SU1498: 1,111.5 ± 125.5, n = 4; p >

(Figures 5E–5H; latency in seconds, FPI: 153.8 ± 58.3, n = 4;
FPI-SU1498: 1,143.8 ± 118.6, n = 5; p < 0.05). These data
demonstrate that blocking the initial increase in neurogene-
sis improves functional outcomes by reducing susceptibility
to chemically evoked seizures.
DISCUSSION
Adult neurogenesis is considered beneficial, replacing
lost neurons, enhancing plasticity, and supporting mem-
ory formation (Sun, 2014). However, whether augmenting
neurogenesis is equally beneficial under pathological con-
ditions is unresolved (Yu et al., 2016b). This study exam-
ined the cellular processes underlying the neurogenic burst
after brain injury and its effect on long-term outcomes.
We demonstrate that the post-injury increase in dentate
neurogenesis is transient and gives way to a marked reduc-
tion by 30 days. As summarized in Figure 6, we identify that
brain injury transiently enhances NPC proliferation and
augments the generation of newborn neurons, which sur-
vive and mature into granule cells. We find that the neuro-
genic burst depletes proliferating NPCs, precipitating a
long-term decline in both basal and stimulus-evoked neu-
rogenesis. Suppressing the post-injury neurogenic burst
to control levels reduced the early increase in dentate excit-
ability after brain injury and reversed the long-term in-
crease in susceptibility to chemically evoked seizures.
These findings indicate that granule cells born early after
injury contribute to abnormal network excitability and
could support epileptogenesis after brain injury. Together
our data demonstrate that excess post-injury neurogenesis
contributes to subsequent decline in neuroproliferation
and enhanced risk for seizures, and suggest that blocking
rather than enhancing neurogenesis will improve long-
term neurological outcome.
Although the post-traumatic burst in DCX-expressing
IGCs is well documented (Kernie and Parent, 2010), we

Graphical representation of the early (3–7 days) and long-term (30–90 days) changes in neuronal precursors, immature and mature granule
cells, and network excitability in sham controls, post-FPI-treated, and post-SU1498-treated FPI rats. Note the increase in neural precursors
and IGCs early after injury accompanied by increases in dentate field excitability (red trace) compared with control. Neural precursor and
IGC numbers show a later decline accompanied by an increase in mature granule cells derived from maturation of the IGCs born during the
early neurogenic burst and seizure susceptibility. VEGFR2 antagonist treatment after FPI reverses the post-injury changes in early
NPC proliferation and reverses early and long-term changes in neurogenesis and excitability after brain injury. n = 3–5 animals for all
experiments performed. Original artwork and schematic design was by Deepak Subramanian.

 demonstrate that the increase in IGCs results from an
increase in the number of actively dividing NPCs. IGCs
born after injury mature into granule cells (Villasana
et al., 2015) (Figure S4), eliminating the possibility that
maturation-incompetent IGCs underlie the observed in-
crease. The post-injury IGC burst is early and transient:
IGCs almost double 3 days after injury and are pro-
gressively reduced by 30 days. The long-term decrease in
DCX-positive neurons after brain injury is consistent
with an earlier report (Atkins et al., 2010) and is associated
with reduced NPC proliferation and a diminished capacity
to enhance neurogenesis in response to excitotoxic chal-
lenge. Notably, both reduction in NPC proliferation and
neurogenic response were restored when the post-trau-
matic NPC proliferative burst was reduced to control levels,
revealing a causal link between the early increase in NPC
proliferation and the delayed decrease in neurogenesis.
Thus, brain injury results in exhaustion of the ‘‘stem cells’’
of the subgranular neuroproliferative zone in a manner
similar to aging (Encinas et al., 2011) or leukemia (Jacob
and Osato, 2009). Our findings demonstrating exhaustion
of neuroproliferative capacity inform current controversies
regarding the true ‘‘stem cell’’ capacity of the hippocampal
neurogenic niche (Walker et al., 2008) and support the pro-
posal that dentate neurogenesis is maintained by precursor
cells with finite proliferative capacity (Bull and Bartlett,
2005; Encinas et al., 2011). Consequently, brain injury
may precipitate an ‘‘accelerated aging’’ with depletion of
NPCs, resulting in near exhaustion of the proliferative ca-
pacity and long-term cognitive deficits after TBI (Whiting
et al., 2006).
Our study used SU1498, a VEGFR2 antagonist previously
reported to provide selective mechanistic suppression of
post-injury increase in IGCs (Lu et al., 2011). In the adult
subgranular zone, VEGFR2 is expressed exclusively in neu-
ral stem and precursor cells where it regulates proliferation
(Kirby et al., 2015). Brain injury rapidly increases hippo-
campal expression of VEGFR2 and its ligand VEGF-A (Lu
et al., 2011; Marti et al., 2000) with VEGF-A increasing
within 12 hr and returning to basal levels by 14 days (Lu
et al., 2011). Consistent with the role for VEGF2 in
increasing NPC proliferation after injury (Lu et al., 2011),
the temporal changes in VEGF signaling correlate with
the early increase in neurogenesis at 3–7 days followed
by decline by 30 days (Figure 1), and SU1498 eliminated
the post-traumatic increase in IGCs without affecting
hilar cell loss or astrogliosis. The ability of both VEGFR2
antisense oligodeoxynucleotide and SU1498 to similarly
reduce the post-traumatic neurogenic burst in earlier
studies (Lu et al., 2011) indicates that SU1498 on neurogen-
esis are specific to VEGFR2 antagonism. Interestingly, at
levels used in our study, SU1498 reduced post-traumatic
NPC proliferation without altering proliferation rates
of Tbr2/Ki67-expressing NPCs in controls (Figure 3C),
implying a minimal role for VEGFR2 signaling in baseline
NPC proliferation. Yet SU1498 reduced DCX-positive IGC
numbers in controls (Figure 3B). The paradoxical reduction
in IGCs following SU1498 treatment in controls despite the
lack of drug effect on NPC proliferation suggests a possible
role for VEGFR2 signaling in altering the time course of IGC
maturation. The selective VEGFR2-dependent regulation
of NPC proliferation after TBI provided a powerful experi-
mental opportunity to suppress excess NPC proliferation
without perturbing basal proliferation as occurs with irradi-
ation or anti-mitotic agents (Sun et al., 2015; Winocur
et al., 2006). Recently, a study demonstrated that precise
ablation of actively dividing neural precursors prior to
experimental seizures reduced the development of sponta-
neous seizures (Cho et al., 2015). Our work complements
the study by Cho et al. (2015) by using a non-terminal
suppression rather than ablation of actively dividing
cells, enabling us to assess the role of excess neurogenesis
in subsequent loss of neurogenic potential. We show that
VEGFR2 suppression after TBI reduces seizure susceptibility
without adversely affecting basal neuroproliferation. In
contrast to reports that prolonged VEGFR2 antagonist infu-
sion promotes neurodegeneration after TBI (Lee and Agos-
ton, 2009), we observed no evidence for ongoing neurode-
generation following the treatment paradigm used in our
study. Furthermore, SU1498 treatment in vivo failed to
enhance dentate excitability in controls, indicating that
VEGF-A-mediated suppression of neuronal excitability,
identified in earlier studies (McCloskey et al., 2005; Sun
and Ma, 2013), is not compromised by the treatment.
Thus, mechanistic suppression of injury-induced neuro-
genic burst with SU1498 offers the ability to examine the
consequences of increased neurogenesis without impairing
basal NPC proliferation rates.
Our finding that the post-injury neurogenic burst gives
rise to mature granule cells is consistent with published
reports (Villasana et al., 2015). This raises the question
of how the cohort of ‘‘excess’’ neurons affects network
function and long-term outcomes. In murine cortical
impact injury, granule cells born after trauma show normal
intrinsic physiology (Villasana et al., 2015). An attractive
proposal argues that enhanced neurogenesis replaces de-
generating neurons after TBI and stabilizes the network
(Sun, 2014). In contrast, our findings that suppressing the
post-injury neurogenic burst prevents both early increases
in dentate network excitability and susceptibility to seizure
suggest that the cohort of granule cells developed after
injury may form abnormal networks and contribute to
long-term pathology. This is not surprising, as brain injury
leads to loss of hilar inhibitory and excitatory neurons and
not granule cells (Santhakumar et al., 2000; Toth et al.,
1997). Since newborn neurons are excitatory, develop
980
Stem Cell Reports j Vol. 9 j 972–984 j September 12, 2017
 into granule cells, and do not migrate ectopically to the
hilus, they are unlikely to compensate for the loss of hilar
inhibitory regulation after TBI. Instead, they add excitatory
neurons to the network and could contribute to the
early post-injury increase in dentate excitability (Gupta
et al., 2012; Neuberger et al., 2014). Additionally, these
neurons develop in an altered network with reduced
hilar inhibitory neurons and mossy cells that innervate
and regulate functional maturation of newborn neurons
(Chancey et al., 2014). Thus the neurogenic burst after
brain trauma is fundamentally different from ‘‘physiologi-
cally’’ enhanced states of neurogenesis in exercise and
learning, which can enhance cognitive outcomes without
promoting pathology.
The ability of the VEGFR2 antagonist treatment to reduce
long-term seizure susceptibility is consistent with aberrant
network connectivity or function of the cohort of neurons
born after injury. However, the ability of the treatment to
suppress early dentate excitability 7–9 days after injury is
surprising as under physiological conditions, proliferating
cells take more than a week to integrate into the network
(Kempermann et al., 2015). VEGF-A/VEGFR2 signaling is
known to suppress and not to enhance excitability,
yet we find that VEGFR2 antagonist reduced excitability
in the dentate. Therefore, direct SU1498 modulation of
cellular excitability cannot account for the ability of the
treatment to reduce dentate excitability after FPI. Since
SU1498 has been shown to increase neuronal excitability
and did not alter excitability in controls, it is unlikely
that the ability of SU1498 to reduce excitability after brain
injury results from non-specific effects. The most parsimo-
nious explanation is that the post-injury neurogenic burst
contributes to enhanced dentate excitability, suggesting
the possibility of accelerated IGC maturation after brain
injury. Thus, treatments suppressing excess neurogenic
burst may reduce the risk for post-traumatic epileptogene-
sis by limiting early increases in network excitability and by
reducing a cohort of neurons that contribute to lasting
changes to the network. It should, however, be noted
that post-traumatic epileptogenesis is a complex process
involving multiple pathways (Guo et al., 2013; Herman,
2002; Hunt et al., 2013; Pitkanen et al., 2014), and targeting
neurogenesis is only one of the strategies used to limit
epilepsy after brain injury.
At concentrations used in our study, a single focal injec-
tion of SU1498 2 hrs after injury can eliminate excess neu-
rogenesis and restore IGCs to control levels. However, it
is possible that limited increases in neurogenesis after
TBI may aid in early recovery of circuit function. Previous
studies have reported that neurogenesis after TBI aids
in improved cognitive performance due to integration of
newborn neurons into the dentate circuit (Sun et al.,
2007; Yu et al., 2016b). Future work should investigate
whether suppression, rather than ablation, of post-injury
neurogenic burst affects the recovery of early and long-
term memory function and if the post-traumatic loss of
neurogenic capacity, identified here, accelerates long-
term neurocognitive decline. In addition, the duration
after injury during which suppressing NPC proliferation
improves outcomes needs to be examined. While we adop-
ted SU1498 ICV injection to ensure localized drug action
in the brain, non-invasive brief systemic treatments with
SU5416, a novel small-molecule inhibitor of VEGFR-2, or
ramucirumab, an anti-VEGFR2 antibody under clinical trial
for cancer therapy (Rosen, 2001), could be an option for
translation to a clinical setting. Thus it is attractive to pro-
pose that the neurogenic potential can be therapeutically
harnessed to support long-term memory performance
and limit epileptogenesis.
In conclusion, we find that the massive increase in NPC
proliferation after brain injury may be doubly detrimental
by depleting NPCs and their proliferative capacity reminis-
cent of accelerated aging and by supporting enhanced
excitability and epileptogenesis. Targeted suppression of
the early post-injury increase in neurogenesis may improve
long-term outcomes after brain injury.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School
(Newark, NJ) and are in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines.
Datasets are available from the corresponding author on reason-
able request.
Fluid Percussion Injury
Juvenile male Wistar rats (23–25 days old) were subject to moderate
(2.0–2.2 atm) lateral FPI or sham injury using established methods
(Gupta et al., 2012).
Animals from the same litter were randomly assigned to con-
trol or FPI groups. Similarly, FPI and sham rats were randomly
assigned to drug or saline groups. FPI rats were excluded from
further studies if the injury peak pressure was below 2.0 atm,
if the waveform lacked a smooth rise, or if the injured rats
showed <10 s apnea.
In Vivo Treatments
Two hours after FPI or sham injury, randomly selected rats under-
went stereotaxic injection (26-gauge needles, Hamilton) of either
VEGFR2 antagonist, SU1498 (2 mL of a 5 mg/mL solution in 20%
DMSO; Calbiochem) or 20% DMSO (vehicle) into the lateral
ventricle (anteroposterior [AP]: �1.8; lateromedial [LM]: +2.5;
dorsoventral [DV]: �3.5) on the injured side under ketamine
(80 mg/kg)-xylazine (10 mg/kg) anesthesia (i.p.). Thirty days after
FPI, a subset of vehicle or SU1498-treated rats were challenged with
a subconvulsive dose of KA (2.5 mg/kg, i.p., Tocris) and perfused
3 days later.

 Histology and Immunohistochemistry
Immunostaining was performed on free-floating sections (40 mm)
of FPI and age-matched sham rats perfused with 4% paraformalde-
hyde 3–90 days after injury. Sections were washed and blocked in
10% normal donkey serum with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 hr. For
DCX staining, sections were incubated overnight in anti-double-
cortin primary antibody (1:100, goat polyclonal; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) in 0.3% Triton X-100 and 2% normal donkey
serum. Double staining for Tbr2 and Ki67 was performed by
sequential labeling with anti-Tbr2 (1:200, rabbit polyclonal, Milli-
pore) for 1 hr followed by addition of anti-Ki67 (1:150, rat mono-
clonal, eBioscience) and overnight incubation. Sections were then
labeled with fluorescent secondary antibodies: donkey anti-goat
Alexa 594 (1:500; Thermo Scientific) to reveal DCX, donkey anti-
rabbit Alexa 488 (1:500; Abcam) to reveal Tbr2, and donkey anti-
rat Alexa 594 (1:500; Thermo Scientific) to reveal Ki67, and
mounted using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Controls omit-
ting primary antibody were routinely included.
Quantification was performed using randomized systematic sam-
pling protocols, selecting every 10th section along the septo-tempo-
ral axis. Cell counts were performed with the Optical Fractionator
probe of Stereo Investigator V.10.02 (MBF Bioscience) at 3100 (oil
objective) on an Olympus Bx51 microscope. In each section, the
subgranular zone was outlined by a contour traced under an 310
objective (Figure 1F) and the number of labeled cells was estimated
based on planimetric volume calculations (Li et al., 2014).
Field and In Vivo Electrophysiology
VEGFR-2 antagonist or vehicle-treated FPI and sham-injured rats
were sacrificed 7–9 days after injury for preparation of acute hippo-
campal slices (400 mm) for examination of perforant path-evoked
dentate population responses (Neuberger et al., 2014) by an inves-
tigator blinded to treatments. Twenty-five days after injury, a sec-
ond group underwent stereotaxic surgical implantation of hippo-
campal depth electrodes (twisted-wire electrode; Plastics One) on
the injured side (AP: �3.0; LM: +3.5; DV: �3.7) under surgical iso-
flurane anesthesia. Rats were allowed to recover for 5–6 days and
connected to a custom tethered EEG system (Pinnacle Technolo-
gies) interfaced with video monitoring (Yu et al., 2016a). Following
10 min of baseline EEG recordings, rats received a single convulsive
dose of KA (5 mg/kg, i.p.) and were continuously monitored
by video-EEG for 3 hrs. Electrographic seizures were defined as:
(1) repetitive spike- and sharp-wave discharges with a frequency
of >1 Hz; (2) amplitude of activity more than 2-fold over baseline
activity; and (3) duration >3 s. The EEG signal was processed as
described previously (Yu et al., 2016a) and analyzed by an investi-
gator blinded to treatments.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using two-tailed Student’s t test, mixed-design
ANOVA, and two-way ANOVA (TW-ANOVA) followed by pairwise
multiple comparison by Holm-Sidak method or mixed-design
ANOVA as appropriate, using SigmaPlot 12.3 or SPSS. Significance
was set to p < 0.05. Sample size for histology is number of animals.
Sample size was determined prior to experiments to achieve a po-
wer of 0.80 and a probability of type I error (a) of 0.05 (Sigma Plot
12.3). Test for normality and equal variance was routinely per-
formed and appropriate statistical tests determined based on
outcomes. Unless stated otherwise, averages of counts from 6 to
8 serial sections were used as an individual data point for each
animal. Data are shown as mean ± SEM.
