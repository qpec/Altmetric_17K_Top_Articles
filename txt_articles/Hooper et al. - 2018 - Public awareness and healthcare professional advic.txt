ABSTRACT
Background Overweight and obesity is the second biggest preventable cause of cancer after smoking, causing ~3.4 million deaths worldwide.
This study provides current UK data on awareness of the link between obesity and cancer by socio-demographic factors, including BMI, and
explores to what degree healthcare professionals provide weight management advice to patients.
Methods Cross-sectional survey of 3293 adults completed an online survey in February/March 2016, weighted to be representative of the UK
population aged 18+.
Results Public awareness of the link between obesity and cancer is low (25.4% unprompted and 57.5% prompted). Higher levels of
awareness existed for least deprived groups (P < 0.001), compared to more deprived groups. Most respondents had seen a healthcare
practitioner in the past 12 months (91.6%) and 17.4% had received advice about their weight, although 48.4% of the sample were
overweight/obese.
Conclusion Cancer is not at the forefront of people’s minds when considering health conditions associated with overweight or obesity. Socio-
economic disparities exist in health knowledge across the UK population, with adults from more affluent groups being most aware. Healthcare
professionals are uniquely positioned to provide advice about weight, but opportunities for intervention are currently under-utilized in
healthcare settings.
Keywords cancer, obesity, socio-economic factors
Background
Overweight and obesity is a contributor to diseases such as
diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke and cancer.1 In 2010
these conditions were estimated to have caused 3.4 million
deaths and 4% of years of life lost worldwide.2 Latest data
has found that 63% of the English3 and 67% of the Scottish
adult population are overweight or obese.4
Obesity is associated with thirteen types of cancer,5
including
breast
(postmenopausal),
kidney,
bowel,
and
womb. In the UK 18 100 cancer cases are attributable to
obesity, ~5% of all cancers.6 A recent study estimated that if
current overweight and obesity trends continue in the UK
there could be an additional 670 000 cancer cases by 2035.7

 In the UK, few studies have explored public knowledge
of the risks of obesity and associations with cancer.
Reported levels of awareness have varied, perhaps due to
differences in study design and recruitment approaches. One
UK survey conducted in 2014 found that when asked an
unprompted question only 10% of respondents recalled that
being overweight is a risk factor for cancer.8 Latest WCRF
data found 62% Britons to be aware of obesity as a risk fac-
tor for cancer.9
Research into cancer risk awareness amongst the UK
population has shown differences in understanding between
groups based on factors such as socio-economic status and
ethnicity.10–12 However, there are few studies that examine
how differences in body mass index (BMI) are related to
awareness of overweight and obesity as a risk factor for can-
cer. In addition, few studies have examined cancer risk aware-
ness and weight in the context of whether individuals have
been given advice by healthcare professionals about the
importance of maintaining a healthy weight. Previous research
has suggested that overweight and obese adults are more
likely to want to weigh less and attempt to lose weight after
having received healthcare practitioner advice.13 Despite this,
only a minority of patients report receiving advice on weight
loss.13 Both patients and healthcare professionals have
expressed frustrations with discussing advice regarding weight
loss.14 Healthcare professionals may not be fully equipped15,16
to engage with patients about why weight is an important risk
factor for a range of health conditions,17 including cancer.
Given these gaps in the literature this study aimed to
investigate: public knowledge of health conditions linked to
overweight and obesity, particularly cancer and the factors
that influence this; and to determine whether adults in the
UK who access healthcare services had been given advice
about their weight.
Methods
An online cross-sectional survey exploring knowledge of
health risks associated with being overweight or obese was
conducted in February 2016. A total of 3490 adults aged 18
and over were recruited by market research company,
YouGov. The survey was weighted to be representative of
the UK population. Geographically targeted over-samples of
an additional 500 participants were obtained from Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland to provide data relevant to
these jurisdictions. There were 3293 complete responses to
the survey (response rate = 94%). Participants were credited
with 50 points (equivalent to 50p) to their YouGov account
once the survey was completed.
Measures
Questions included in the survey were informed by previous
research conducted by Buykx et al.18 in Australia. Additional
items were incorporated from other survey tools and
adapted where necessary. Where no existing tools could be
found, new questions were developed and tested for clarity,
content and style of questions using Cancer Research UK’s
patient panel group and health professionals from the
Scottish Cancer Prevention Network.
Key demographic information held by YouGov included
gender, age and region lived, including nine English regions,
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Socio-economic sta-
tus (SES) was calculated by YouGov based on the National
Readership Survey (NRS) system and grouped into four: AB
(higher and intermediate managerial, administrative, profes-
sional occupations), C1 (supervisory, clerical and junior
managerial, administrative, professional occupations), C2
(skilled manual occupations), DE (semi-skilled and unskilled
manual occupations, unemployed and lowest grade occupa-
tions). BMI was calculated using self-reported height and
weight: weight (kg)/(height (m2)). BMI categories were
grouped:
underweight
(<18.5 kg/m2),
normal
weight
(18.5–24.9 kg/m2),
overweight
(25–29.9 kg/m2),
obese
(>30 kg/m2).19 Any cancer diagnosis was also recorded.
Cancer risk awareness was explored using an unprompted
open-ended question: ‘Which, if any, health conditions do
you think can result from being obese/ overweight?’; and a
prompted question: ‘Which, if any, of the following health
conditions do you think can result from being overweight/
obese?’ Prompted response options included diabetes, heart
disease, stroke, cancer and arthritis. Unprompted and
prompted cancer awareness were both coded into dichotom-
ous variables (aware of obesity as a risk factor for cancer
versus not). Participants were provided with a list of thirteen
cancer types and asked to select whether a person would be
at increased risk of developing each cancer through being
overweight or obese. ‘Yes’, ‘No’ and ‘Don’t know’ response
options were provided. The four most prevalent cancer
types in the UK associated with body weight were selected
for analysis: breast (postmenopausal), kidney, bowel and
womb. Responses were coded into two variables: ‘Yes’ if
participants had selected the correct response, and ‘No’ if
they incorrectly selected the cancer type. Don’t know
responses were re-coded as ‘No’ responses.
Respondents were asked, ‘In the past 12 months, has a
doctor, nurse, or other healthcare professional given you
advice about your weight?’. Response options included:
‘No’, ‘Yes, lose weight’, ‘Yes, gain weight’, ‘Yes, maintain
current weight’, ‘Not applicable, have not seen a healthcare

 professional in the past 12 months’, ‘Don’t know/can’t
remember’. Advice to gain weight, other advice, not applic-
able and don’t know/can’t remember responses were coded
as missing for the analysis.
Analysis
Data were analysed using IBM SPSS Version 23 and
Statacorp Stata Statistical Software release 13. Weights were
applied to age, gender, SES and region to ensure the results
were representative of the population. Weighted results are
presented here, unless otherwise specified. Univariable chi
squared analysis was undertaken to explore the relationship
between cancer awareness and socio-demographic factors
and BMI. Age, SES, gender, BMI and the cancer diagnosis
variables were then entered into a multivariable logistic
regression
model,
with
step-wise
elimination
of
non-
significant variables. Ordinal regression was carried out to
explore factors associated with receiving healthcare practi-
tioner advice. As we are interested in advice given to over-
weight and obese people, the underweight BMI category was
coded as missing for the regression analysis. Response cat-
egories: advice to gain weight; other advice; not applicable;
and don’t know/can’t remember responses were coded as
missing for the analysis.
Results
A nationally representative sample of 3293 people from
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland completed
the survey. Of these, 51.3% were females and 48.7% were
males. The proportion in each of the SES categories were:
AB 22%; C1 30%; C2 15%, DE 33% (Table 1).
Unprompted, only 25.4% of respondents listed cancer as
a health condition that could result from being overweight
or obese. When prompted with a list of potential health con-
ditions, 57.5% selected cancer. Arthritis was the least
selected health condition (50%) and diabetes was the most
selected condition (93.6%).
For cancer types known to be associated with overweight
and obesity, knowledge was wide-ranging with responses
ranging from 21.5% for womb cancer to 60.1% for bowel
cancer.
The vast majority of participants (3018/3293, 91.6%) had
seen a seen a doctor, nurse or healthcare professional in a
healthcare setting in the past 12 months and recalled
whether or not they had received advice about their weight.
Of these, 74.2% did not receive any advice and 17.4% had
received some form of advice about their weight. Twelve
percent had been told to lose weight; 4% to maintain their
current weight; 1% to gain weight and the remaining 1%
were given ‘other advice’. As the proportion of the sample
given advice to gain weight or other advice was so small,
they were excluded for the next stage of the analysis. The
majority of the unweighted sample (52.1%) and just under
half of the weighted sample (48.4%) were overweight or
obese. Results examining the relationship between the weight
of respondent and receipt of advice are outlined below.

 Univariate analysis
For the unprompted cancer awareness question, it was
found that SES (30.1% AB versus 22% DE P < 0.001) and
having ever had a cancer diagnosis were significant factors
in cancer awareness (34.5% ever diagnosed versus 24.7%
never diagnosed P = 0.008). Gender also had a small but
significant association with awareness (26.9% females versus
23.8% males P = 0.041).
Prompted awareness was significantly associated with SES
and BMI. AB respondents were more likely to be aware of
being overweight or obese as a risk factor for cancer than all
of the other social grades (66.6 versus 50.6% P < 0.001).
Respondents of normal weight were the most likely to be
aware of overweight/obesity as a risk factor for cancer and
respondents who were obese were the least likely to be
aware (63.6 versus 52.3%, P < 0.001).
Of the four cancer types examined, awareness of their
association with overweight/obesity was greatest from the
highest SES group (AB) across all cancer types (P < 0.001).
People who were normal weight were most likely to know of
the relationship between all cancer types and obesity (P <
0.001) apart from womb cancer (P = 0.065) Highest aware-
ness was found among 18–39 year olds for kidney and
womb cancers (P < 0.001) and there was greater awareness
among females for postmenopausal breast cancer (34 versus
28.1%, P < 0.001) and males for kidney cancer (46.2 versus
42%, P = 0.008).
All demographics listed: age, gender, SES, including BMI
and cancer diagnosis were significant factors in receiving
advice to lose or maintain weight. Around twice as many
people aged over 60 received advice to lose weight com-
pared to 18–39 year olds (16.1 versus 7.8% P < 0.001).
Obese and overweight respondents were significantly more
likely to receive advice to lose weight than those who were
normal weight (obese: 38.3% and overweight: 11.7% versus
normal weight 2.3% P < 0.001).
Multivariate analysis
The logistic regression models for unprompted cancer
awareness showed that the highest SES group (AB) were
more likely to be aware of the links between overweight and
cancer than those from the lowest two SES groups (C2 P <
0.001, OR = 0.532 and DE P < 0.001, OR = 0.638) as
were males (compared to females) (P = 0.012, OR = 1.233).
Having ever been diagnosed with cancer was also shown to
be significant contributor to unprompted cancer awareness
of obesity risk (P = 0.017, OR = 0.648) (Table 2).
For prompted cancer awareness, the only factor inde-
pendently associated with awareness was SES. Those from
the highest social grade (AB) showed greatest awareness
compared to all other SES groups (C1 P = 0.11, OR =
0.77, C2 P < 0.001, OR = 0.573, DE P < 0.001, OR =
0.515) (Table 3).
Gender was an independent predictor for cancer type
awareness for postmenopausal breast and kidney cancer
with females (P < 0.001, OR = 0.746) and males (P =
0.022, OR = 1.177) more likely to be aware of body weight
association, respectively. Those from the highest SES group
(AB) were most likely to be aware of each cancer type, com-
pared to all other groups (postmenopausal breast: C2 P =
0.006 OR = 1.436, DE P < 0.001, OR = 1.506; kidney: C1
P = 0.021, OR = 1.259, DE P < 0.001, OR = 1.634; bowel:
DE P < 0.001 OR = 1.836; womb: C1 P = 0.040. OR =
1.291, C2 P = 0.012, OR = 1.469). Those aged 18–39 years
old were most likely to know that kidney (40–59 P < 0.001,
OR = 1.722, 60 + P < 0.001 OR = 1.759) and womb
(40–59 P = 0.002, OR = 1.384, 60 + P < 0.001, OR =
1.757) cancers are associated with overweight and obesity
compared to all other age groups (Table 3).
Ordinal regression analysis for healthcare practitioner
advice found all factors were significant apart from age and
having previously received a cancer diagnosis. Normal
weight respondents were significantly less likely to receive
advice to lose weight, but were more likely to be told to
maintain weight than overweight or obese respondents (P <
0.001 OR = 5.844) (Table 4).
Discussion
Main finding of this study
Awareness of being overweight or obese as a risk factor for
cancer was generally low with only 25.4% of respondents
listing cancer when asked an unprompted question. This
shows that cancer is not at the forefront of people’s minds
when considering health risks associated with body weight.
When asked a prompted question, 57.5% of the sample
recognized overweight/obesity as a risk factor for cancer;
however, awareness of the association between overweight
and diabetes was much greater (93.6%). In both instances,
SES played a significant role with those from the highest
SES group being more aware than the other SES groups.
There were misconceptions about cancer types linked to
overweight and obesity. Greater levels of awareness were
found for cancers of the digestive system organs such as,
bowel and kidney, but not for reproductive organs, such as
womb or postmenopausal breast.
The majority of respondents (91.6%) had seen a health-
care practitioner in the past 12 months. However, only one
in five respondents had been given any advice about their

 weight and if advice was provided, it was focused on losing
weight. It is positive that the group receiving advice to lose
weight most often self-reported as being obese (38.3%) but
this was not the case individuals who were overweight
(11.7%). It is important that advice on weight is provided by
health professionals to individuals who are overweight and
therefore at higher risk of becoming obese. It is estimated
that average weight gain in adulthood is around 400 g per
annum and this may be greater with increasing age.20
What is already known about this topic
Although previous studies have collected data on aware-
ness of obesity as a risk factor for cancer,8,9,11,12,21 there
are limited data available for unprompted responses and
particularly data exploring knowledge of risks related to
specific cancer types. Public awareness of disease risk is
considered important as it has an influence on behavioural
intentions.22
A recent study reported that 17% of overweight and 42%
of obese people had received advice to lose weight from a
healthcare practitioner.13 A 2013 literature review and meta-
analysis of survey data found physician advice had a
significant impact on intention to change behaviour and lose
weight.23 Healthcare settings are favourable environments
for receiving weight loss advice13,24 and effecting behaviour
change23,25,26 as well as raising cancer risk awareness.22
However, such opportunities are currently under-utilized.27
What the study adds
This is the first study to explore factors associated with
knowledge of obesity as a risk factor for cancer using both
prompted and unprompted response options. Additionally,
data on public awareness of the link between overweight/
obesity and cancer for the four most prevalent cancer types
linked to overweight and obesity has been explored. Those
from lower SES groups are more likely to be overweight or
obese (64% males and 51% females in highest SES group
compared to 67% males and 63% females in lowest SES
group).28 Modelled projections show overweight and obesity
trends will increase by 2035 (76% males and 69% females)
and the gap between the highest and lowest income quintile is
expected to widen further.7 This study lends support to the
concept of providing targeted programmes for vulnerable
populations. Whilst there is concern over health education

 increasing health inequalities this has not been demonstrated
in weight loss programmes.29
The data reported here show that there are public mis-
conceptions of cancer types associated with overweight and
obesity. These are of particular interest as in the UK breast
cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers,30 yet there are
poor levels of public awareness of its link to body weight. In
addition, there has also been an increase in cancers of the
womb that has been linked to increases in population obesity
rates.31 The proportion of kidney cancer cases are also
increasing and are projected to continue.30 It is therefore
vital that population measures to halt and ultimately reduce
rates for overweight and obese are implemented in the UK.
This study reiterates similar data from earlier research13,27
exploring healthcare practitioner advice about body weight,
therefore building the evidence base further in this area. The
data has shown that whilst most of the population see a
health practitioner, a small proportion are given any advice
about their weight. As there is a real need to prevent people
from becoming overweight or obese, attendance at health-
care settings provide significant opportunities to advise peo-
ple about their weight.13,23,25,26 However, these are currently
being missed.27 There is a need for healthcare practitioners
to be sufficiently equipped and trained to provide weight
loss advice.15,16,32
Limitations of this study
Limitations include the sampling method which was an online
survey where a panel was used to recruit participants and
therefore a self-selected group. As with any cross-sectional
survey, data cannot be collected over a period time to analyse
behaviour change. When comparing the study data to Health
Survey for England (HSE) data, the levels of obesity, as calcu-
lated by self-reported BMI, are lower in this study than those
seen in the latest HSE (2015) data (20 versus 27%).28 This
could be due to 9% of participants not providing their weight
and that the data was self-reported. HSE use an objective
method of measuring weight and height at the time of collect-
ing survey data and is therefore a more validated approach. A
priority for future research should be to explore what kind of
advice healthcare practitioners are giving to patients about
their weight, whether these are in line with official guidance
and what the barriers are to giving advice.
Summary
Only a quarter of adults in the UK are aware of cancer as a
health condition associated with being overweight or obese.
Differences in awareness exist between socio-economic groups
and weight status, as those from more affluent groups have
higher levels of awareness and generally lower BMI than those

care professionals to advise about weight loss, but these appear
to be under-utilized—in this study only 38.3% of respondents
who were obese were advised to lose weight.
