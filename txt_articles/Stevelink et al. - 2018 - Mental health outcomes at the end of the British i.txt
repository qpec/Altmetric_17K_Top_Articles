Background
Little is known about the prevalence of mental health outcomes
in UK personnel at the end of the British involvement in the Iraq
and Afghanistan conflicts.
Aims
We examined the prevalence of mental disorders and alcohol
misuse, whether this differed between serving and ex-serving
regular personnel and by deployment status.
Method
This is the third phase of a military cohort study (2014–2016;
n = 8093). The sample was based on participants from previous
phases (2004–2006 and 2007–2009) and a new randomly
selected sample of those who had joined the UK armed forces
since 2009.
Results
The prevalence was 6.2% for probable post-traumatic stress
disorder, 21.9% for common mental disorders and 10.0% for
alcohol misuse. Deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan and a combat
role during deployment were associated with significantly worse
mental health outcomes and alcohol misuse in ex-serving
regular personnel but not in currently serving regular personnel.
Conclusions
The findings highlight an increasing prevalence of post-traumatic
stress disorder and a lowering prevalence of alcohol misuse
compared with our previous findings and stresses the import-
ance of continued surveillance during service and beyond.

Since 2001, more than 280 000 UK service personnel deployed to
Iraq and Afghanistan, some on multiple occasions.1 Many of
those who deployed are likely to have been exposed to potentially
traumatic events. It is essential to ensure long-term follow-up of
these individuals to understand the consequences of deployment,
including once personnel have left military service.2–5 Research con-
ducted among Vietnam veterans highlighted how concerns emerged
about the mental health impact in the years following the conflict.6–9
The passage of time provides the opportunity to study what has hap-
pened to those who have left military service. More than 19 000
trained regular personnel leave the UK armed forces annually to
resume civilian life.10 Research examining psychosocial outcomes
for UK ex-serving personnel suggests that the majority transition
with few difficulties;11–13 however, those who experience mental
health difficulties during service appear to be at risk of developing
social,
occupational
or
health-related
problems
after
leaving.11,14,15 In the UK, veterans are referred to as those who
have left military service whereas in the USA, the term veteran is
also applied to those who have served in a particular campaign
(for example ‘Iraq veterans’). To prevent confusion, we will use
the term ‘ex-serving personnel’ throughout to indicate former
members of the UK armed forces.
In 2003, the King’s Centre for Military Health Research estab-
lished a cohort study to examine the potential impact of deployment
to Iraq on the health and well-being of UK service personnel.5 So
far findings have been reported on two waves of data collection
(2004–2006 and 2007–2009) indicating that, at a population level,
there was no overall excess of mental health consequences arising
for those who deployed compared with other members of the

 armed forces who had not deployed to those conflicts.4,5 However,
particular subgroups were found to be at an increased risk of mental
ill health and alcohol misuse, namely reserves and those who experi-
enced direct combat exposure. We now provide the main outcomes
of the third wave of the cohort study. We describe the prevalence of
mental disorders and alcohol misuse; investigate whether mental
disorders differed between serving and ex-serving personnel and
examine the association with deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan.
Method
Study design and participants
The cohort study started in June 2004, initially comparing the health
of two randomly selected samples: individuals who had deployed to
the initial conflict in Iraq (termed Op TELIC) were compared with
individuals who were serving but who at that time had not deployed
to Iraq (termed the Era group), despite being deployable. The study
sought to recruit 17 698 individuals. Of the 17 499 actively followed
up, 10 272 participated (a 59% response rate; these 10272 were
included in the paper reporting on the outcomes of phase one5
and subsequently 37 responded late and were included in the
follow-up).
Of the 9395 phase one participants who consented to further
contact, 6429 (68%) completed phase two of the study that took
place between November 2007 and September 2009. The original
design had been based on the premise that this would be a replication
of our previous studies on the impact of the 1991 Gulf War,16 but
events made it necessary to modify this. The war in Iraq had contin-
ued, and UK troops had also been deployed to Afghanistan (termed
Op HERRICK); two additional samples were needed in phase two. A
random sample of personnel deployed to Afghanistan between April
2006 and April 2007 along with a new sample of trained regular and
reserve personnel who had joined the service since April 2003 (the
phase two replenishment sample). The final HERRICK sample com-
prised 1789 regular and reserve personnel of whom 896 (50%)
responses were received. The final sample size of the replenishment
sample was 6628 and of whom 2665 (40%) individuals responded.
Overall, 9990 (56%) personnel responded at phase two. Full details
of sampling and response rates have been reported previously.4
Subsequently, a short version of the phase two questionnaire was
sent to all non-responders (n = 3109) and 300 (9.7%) responses
were received.
Phase three re-contacted participants who consented to further
contact in phases one or two, including those who completed a short
version of the phase two survey (termed the follow-up sample). The
follow-up sample comprised 12 280 individuals; 10 148 regular and
2132 reserve personnel. A replenishment sample of trained regular
and reserve personnel who joined the military on or after 1 August
2009 and were still in service on the 31 March 2013 was also selected
for sampling. This phase three replenishment sample comprised
8581 individuals, 6915 regular and 1666 reserve personnel (supple-
mentary Fig. 1 available at https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2018.175).
Procedures
Participation in phase three of the study involved completing a self-
administered questionnaire that was available in both hard copy and
electronic versions. Both versions of the questionnaire were piloted
at an Army garrison to ensure that the questions were acceptable
and understood. The questionnaire had sections covering (a) socio-
demographics; (b) service information (which was completed by ex-
serving personnel too), for example service branch, current or last
rank, type of engagement, deployment status; (c) experiences
during last deployment (for example duty, duration of deployment
and combat exposure); (d) experiences of transition from deploy-
ment and home coming; (e) current mental and physical health;
and (f) relationships and lifestyle (for example marital status,
smoking and drinking behaviour).
Health questions enquired about symptoms of common mental
disorders (CMD), using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire
(GHQ-12);17 probable post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), using
the 17-item National Centre for PTSD Checklist (PCL-C);18 and
alcohol use, using the 10-item World Health Organization Alcohol
Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT).19 Binary outcome vari-
ables were defined using the following cut-off scores for ‘caseness’:
4 or more for the GHQ-12 (scores range from 0 to 12),20 50 or
more for the PCL-C (scores range from 17 to 85)18 and 16 or more
for the AUDIT (scores range from 0 to 40)21 (usually defined as haz-
ardous use that is also harmful to health, which we have termed
alcohol misuse).
Data collection
Data collection took place between October 2014 and December
2016. Invitations were sent to individuals using addresses supplied
by participants at earlier phases, or the address supplied by the
UK Ministry of Defence if the person was in service or was newly
sampled at phase three. Individuals were sent a postal invitation
to complete the online survey along with a participant information
leaflet. Non-responders to the postal invitation were sent a repeat
invitation by email. Subsequently, all non-responders were sent a
paper version of the questionnaire along with log-in details for
the online version and a postage paid return envelope.
An intensive period of follow-up and tracing of non-responders
began in September 2015 and continued until August 2016. For
those who were still serving, key administrative personnel within
the parent unit were approached to ask for assistance in distributing
invitation packs and ascertaining new contact details for those who
had moved unit. It was requested that, where possible, the potential
participants be given allocated work time to complete the question-
naire. The voluntary nature of the study was emphasised; if indivi-
duals did not wish to take part they could return a blank
questionnaire to the research team. A 5-day visit to a single large
garrison was carried out in which a series of sessions were organised
to enable participants to meet the members of the research team and
complete a paper version of the questionnaire.
Those who had left service and reserves were contacted by tele-
phone if they had provided home contact details before. Repeat invi-
tation packs were mailed or emailed if an individual indicated that
they were willing to take part. Where telephone numbers were
incorrect, alternative numbers were sought from directory enqui-
ries. Updated addresses were sought for individuals who were
uncontactable by 25 August 2016 via the National Health Service
Personal Demographics Service but only for those who had previ-
ously given consent to be re-contacted.
Analyses
All samples were combined; sample weights were generated to
account for the different sampling groups used. Sample weights
were calculated as the inverse probability of an individual being
sampled from a specific subpopulation (TELIC, Era, HERRICK,
phase two replenishment, phase three replenishment) and specific
engagement type (regular or reserve). Response weights were gener-
ated to account for non-response and calculated as the inverse prob-
ability of responding once sampled, driven by factors shown
empirically to predict response (gender, age, rank, service, engage-
ment type, serving status, sample and the interaction between
sample and engagement type). The sample weights and response
weights were multiplied together to make a single weight. The

 weighted analyses provided valid results under the assumption that
the data were missing at random and that the observed variables
modelled to drive non-response were correctly identified.
The sociodemographic, military and health characteristics of
our sample were described first using the full sample of the
cohort, after which univariable and multivariable logistic regres-
sions were carried out examining the association between deploy-
ment experiences and each mental disorder on subgroups of
interest. The main analyses assessed the association between
mental disorder (PTSD, CMD and alcohol misuse) and deployment
experiences, stratified by engagement (regular or reserve personnel)
and serving status (currently serving or ex-serving regular person-
nel). The primary exposure variables were deployed to Iraq and/
or Afghanistan or not, role on last deployment (combat role or
combat (service) support) and number of deployments. Self-
reported deployment data were used. Weighted percentages and
odds ratios (ORs) are presented in the tables along with unweighted
cell counts. Multivariable analyses were adjusted for predefined
sociodemographic (gender, age, marital and educational status)
and military factors (rank, service, engagement type). All statistical
analyses were performed using the statistical package Stata (version
14.2), with survey commands used to account for weighting.
Ethical approval
Ethical approval for the study was granted by the UK Ministry of
Defence Research Ethics Committee (reference: 448/MODREC/13)
and the King’s College London Psychiatry Nursing and Midwifery
Research Ethics Subcommittee (Reference: PNM/12/13–169).
Results
The overall adjusted response rate was 57.8% for the follow-up
sample (n = 6346) and 24.0% for the replenishment sample
(n = 1747) (overall response rate 44.3%) (supplementary Fig. 1).
The features of non-response have not changed since the start of
this cohort study: responders were significantly more likely to be
older, women, regulars, hold officer rank, in the Royal Air Force
rather than the Royal Navy and Royal Marines (henceforth together
termed Naval Services) and the Army. An important finding is that
poorer mental health at phase two did not predict response at phase
three, suggesting that response was not biased by the main outcome
except for those who reported symptoms of alcohol misuse at phase
two who were less likely to respond (supplementary Table 1).
Table 1 describes the sociodemographic and military character-
istics of those included in the study by deployment status. Of the
8093 participants included in the study, 61.9% had deployed to
Iraq or Afghanistan. Those in the deployed group were in general
more likely to be men, in the Army, regular personnel and currently
serving. These factors are characteristic of the ground combat units
and their supporting elements that make up the bulk of personnel
during land deployments.
Prevalence of mental disorders and alcohol misuse
Overall 21.9% (95% CI 20.75–23.01; n = 1739) of participants reported
symptoms of CMD, 6.2% (95% CI 5.49–6.89; n = 417) reported prob-
able PTSD and 10.0% (95% CI 9.20–10.90; n = 733) reported alcohol

 misuse. The prevalence of mental health outcomes varied by socio-
demographic and military characteristics (supplementary Table 2).
Type of engagement (regulars versus reserves)
As in phase one and phase two of the cohort study, there was a sig-
nificant interaction between deployment status (not deployed to
Iraq/Afghanistan or deployed to Iraq/Afghanistan) and engagement
type (regular or reserve status) on CMD (P = 0.002) indicating
a higher prevalence of CMD in deployed reserves compared
with deployed regulars.4,5 No significant interaction was found
for probable PTSD (P = 0.47) or alcohol misuse (P = 0.94). Still,
because of the interaction we found for CMD, the impact of
deployment was examined separately for regulars and reserves
(Table 2). Compared with reserves who did not deploy to Iraq
and/or Afghanistan, those reserves who had deployed continued
to report significantly more symptoms of CMD, probable PTSD
and alcohol misuse. Raised levels of PTSD were found among
deployed regulars compared with those who had not deployed.
Higher levels of alcohol misuse were reported in deployed regular
personnel compared with those who had not deployed although
the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.063).
As the majority of personnel who deployed constitute regulars
and the number of reserves in our sample is relatively small, our ana-
lyses focused on the mental health of regulars in the next sections.
Serving status (serving versus ex-serving)
In contrast to previous phases of the cohort study, our sample com-
prised a large number of ex-serving personnel. Table 3 shows the
association between mental health outcomes according to serving
status (currently serving and ex-serving). Findings showed that
probable PTSD was lower among serving personnel than ex-
serving personnel. After adjustment, probable PTSD and alcohol
misuse were significantly associated with serving status: the odds
were significantly higher in ex-serving personnel (adjusted OR =
1.73, 95% CI 1.25–2.40 and adjusted OR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.08–1.70,
respectively). No difference was found in the prevalence of CMD
by serving status.
We found a significant interaction between deployment status
(not deployed to Iraq/Afghanistan or deployed to Iraq/Afghanistan)
and serving status (serving or ex-serving) for probable PTSD
(P<0.001) and alcohol misuse (P<0.01) indicating that the effect of
deployment on PTSD and alcohol misuse differed in those still
serving compared with those who had left service. There was no sig-
nificant interaction for CMD (P = 0.09). So, because of the interaction
for probable PTSD and alcohol misuse, the impact of deployment
was examined separately by serving status (supplementary Table 3).
Deployment was not statistically significantly associated with any of
the mental health outcomes in serving regulars; the adjusted OR of
alcohol misuse was slightly raised, but did not reach statistical signifi-
cance (adjusted OR = 1.43, 95% CI 0.99–2.07; P = 0.06). In ex-serving
regulars, probable PTSD remained significantly associated with
deployment following adjustment (adjusted OR = 1.55, 95% CI
1.03–2.34). Alcohol misuse was no longer associated with deployment
among ex-serving personnel in the adjusted analyses (adjusted
OR = 1.19, 95% CI 0.86–1.64).
Military role, number of deployments and time since
deployment
To assess whether there was an association between experience of
combat duties and mental health, further analysis was conducted
among regular personnel who had been deployed to Iraq or
Afghanistan, stratified by serving status. Overall around one-third
held a combat role, whereas the majority were in a combat

 (service) support role such as medical, logistics, signals and aircrew.
In contrast to previous results from the cohort study, no association
was found between self-reported role and the mental health out-
comes or alcohol misuse among serving regulars (Table 4). PTSD
was higher in those with combat exposure, but not sufficiently
robust for statistical inference.
For ex-serving regulars, unadjusted analyses suggested that
those who held a combat role were more likely to report symptoms
of CMD, probable PTSD and alcohol misuse compared with those
who deployed in a combat (service) support role. After adjustment,
these associations remained significant for CMD and PTSD
(adjusted OR = 1.70, 95% CI 1.28–2.41 and adjusted OR 2.53, 95%
CI 1.60–3.99, respectively) (Table 4).
No association was found between the number of deployments
and mental health problems, irrespective of serving status among
Army and Royal Marines, who provide the majority of personnel
during land combat operations (supplementary Tables 4 and 5).
Comparison across cohort study phases
The adjusted prevalence estimates of mental health outcomes and
alcohol misuse across the three phases of the cohort study among
serving regular and ex-serving regular personnel can be found in
supplementary Tables 6 and 7.
A reduction in alcohol misuse is apparent in both regular
serving and ex-serving personnel, especially when comparing
rates in deployed personnel from phase three with phase two.
Over time, rates of probable PTSD seem to be relatively stable in
serving personnel. However, increased rates are found in ex-
serving regular personnel, irrespective of whether they have been
deployed or not. Levels of CMD symptoms have decreased over
time in ex-serving regulars whereas CMD are now more common
among serving personnel in phase three, compared with the other
two phases, with the highest levels found among those not deployed.
Discussion
The third phase of this UK military cohort study showed that of the
three main mental health problems measured, CMD and alcohol
misuse continue to be the most common mental health problems
reported by UK service personnel. Ex-serving regulars were report-
ing higher levels of PTSD and alcohol misuse than serving regulars.
Further, past deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan was associated
with higher rates of probable PTSD among ex-serving regulars.
The highest levels of PTSD and CMD were found in ex-serving
regulars who had deployed in a combat role. Rates of alcohol
misuse were comparable, irrespective of serving status. Neither
history of deployment nor last deployment in a combat role was
associated with adverse mental health outcomes or alcohol misuse
in serving regulars.
Strengths and limitations
First, non-response rates and characteristics have not changed since
the start of the study, and are intrinsic to all studies of this type of
population.22 The response rate of the replenishment group was
disappointing in contrast to the follow-up group. We made exten-
sive efforts using multiple methods of tracing and recruiting parti-
cipants, but this group was more reluctant to participate than the
rest of the cohort. We applied adequate weighing procedures to
mitigate this potential source of bias as explained in the methods
section. We are not alone in reporting difficulties to recruit military
personnel in large studies. The response rate of the US Millennium
Cohort was 77 058 (30%) out of a total sample of 256 400. The
RAND report Invisible Wounds of War also received a very
limited response, however, the actual rate was difficult to estimate
because the sampling frame included many telephone numbers
that were not working.23,24 Poor mental health at phase two did
not predict response at phase three, with the exception of alcohol
misuse and even for alcohol misuse this association was mild.
Second, individuals with probable mental disorders were identified
using self-report measures, still these have been validated and used
extensively in general population studies. Further, these measures
have been used in the previous phases of the cohort study and
hence enable comparisons over time. Third, the analyses presented
here are cross-sectional and therefore causal interpretations cannot
be drawn. Nevertheless, the results of this study are based on large,
randomly selected samples of deployed and not deployed UK mili-
tary serving personnel representing the UK armed forces participa-
tion in Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts throughout the whole period,
i.e. from 2003 until 2015.
Differences in mental health outcomes and alcohol
misuse among serving and ex-serving regular personnel
The prevalence of probable PTSD in previously deployed ex-serving
regular personnel was found to be more than twice the rate found
among previously deployed serving regulars (9% versus 4%) (sup-
plementary Table 3). The differential impact of deployment on
mental health outcomes in current and former personnel becomes
even more pronounced when examined in relation to deploying
in a combat role. In contrast to the previous phases of the cohort
study, no association was found between combat role and poorer
mental health in serving regular personnel; however among ex-
serving regulars symptoms of probable PTSD (17% versus 6%)
and CMD (31% versus 19%) were significantly elevated.4,5 A pos-
sible explanation is that personnel who are mentally unwell either
elect to leave service or are more likely to be discharged for
medical reasons and also have poorer outcomes after leaving
service.11,25 Self-reported role during the last deployment was
used as a proxy for combat exposure. We admit that those who
reported being in a combat (service) support role may still have
been exposed to combat, for example those working in medical ser-
vices or counter-improvised explosive device teams.26 A systematic
review suggested that combat-related PTSD was most strongly asso-
ciated with having experienced combat, discharging a weapon and
having seen someone wounded or killed.27–29 Although, self-
reported combat role may not have been totally reflective of the
range of specific combat experiences personnel may have been
exposed to, it is a good summary measure of combat exposure
during deployment. Further, we have used the same measure
when describing the results of the previous phases of this cohort

 study thereby allowing the comparison of findings.4,5 Although in a
military context combat exposure is the main factor under consid-
eration, other factors could be associated with the development of
PTSD that may not be related to deployment such as childhood
adversity, traffic road accidents, sexual abuse and other additional
life stresses.30
A recent international systematic review indicated that a minor-
ity of personnel who leave the Services experience hardship in a
range of life domains such as homelessness, financial difficulties, psy-
chological difficulties, substance misuse and lack of social support.31
It is possible that, for some, the transition from military service to
civilian life triggers additional stresses that can have a negative
impact on mental health. In addition, personnel may be more reluc-
tant to disclose their symptoms during service, as they may fear being
stigmatised or the possibility of negative occupational consequences
should they report mental health symptoms.32,33
As shown in the previous phases of the cohort study, for Army
and Royal Marine regular personnel, no association was found
between the number of deployments undertaken to Iraq or
Afghanistan and any mental health outcomes, irrespective of
remaining in Service or leaving.4,5 This finding could be attributed
in part to the healthy warrior concept; a selection effect whereby
those who are unwell are less likely to deploy again or are more
likely to leave Service.34 Alternatively, the lack of association
between number of deployments and poorer mental health may
represent a positive effect arising from adherence to the UK
Armed Forces Harmony Guidelines that recommend both limiting
the cumulative frequency of deployment and adhering to the sug-
gested length of time between deployments.35 However, we did
not account for length of deployment in our analyses or the time
between deployments. The reason for this decision was that we
have published two papers that examined this specifically.35,36
The cohort study primarily examined the health and well-being
legacy of deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan; it is possible that
various other concurrent operations may have contributed to the
mental health impact of deployment.
Differences in mental health outcomes and alcohol
misuse among deployed and non-deployed reserves
Mental health symptomatology of deployed reserves is comparable
with that of deployed regulars. However, when we compare
deployed reserves with reserves who did not deploy, they reported
worse health outcomes. These findings have been replicated over
the duration of the cohort study. There are various explanations
why we see a deployment effect for reserves, for example more prob-
lematic homecoming experiences and more limited support or
understanding from reserve families and close friends about
aspects of military life and deployment than that found among reg-
ulars.37 Furthermore, reserves tend to deploy as singletons or small
specialist units and as such do not have access to the supportive
structure of formed units pre- and post-deployment.
Prevalence rates of CMD, PTSD and alcohol misuse
across cohort phases
The overall prevalence of CMD remained similar across the three
phases of the cohort study whereas the prevalence of alcohol
misuse declined at each phase, irrespective of serving status.4,5 In
contrast to phase two results of the cohort study, alcohol misuse
was no longer associated with deployment at phase three. There
are three major factors that could account for the decline: first,
there has been a comparable decline in alcohol consumption in
the UK general population;38 second, alcohol misuse becomes less
frequent with age and, although a replenishment sample was
recruited to minimise this effect, the average age of cohort

 participants has increased over time; third, alcohol misuse at phase
two was associated with non-response during phase three; however,
this association was mild.
Probable PTSD remained the least common outcome compared
with CMD, but the overall prevalence of probable PTSD increased
from 4 to 6% between phase one/two and phase three. In previous
phases of the cohort study, rates of PTSD in the military population
were overall similar to the general population, but now appear to be
elevated by comparison.39 This seems to be mainly driven by the
higher rates found in ex-serving personnel, particularly those who
deployed in a combat role. However, the levels found in the UK
military have yet to reach the levels seen in the US military40–42
and do not as of yet seem to justify ‘bow wave’, ‘tsunami’ or ‘time
bomb’ metaphors commonly reported in the popular press,
although of course this can always change.
Levels of PTSD have repeatedly been shown to be lower in the
UK military compared with the USA and various explanations
have been put forward concerning deployment characteristics,
such as possible higher levels of combat exposure among US
troops, differential demographics of those deployed (US personnel
more likely to be younger, of lower rank and reservists), and
length of deployment as well as cultural differences such as access
to healthcare and attitudes towards trauma reporting.26 Still, the
increase of PTSD rates in ex-serving personnel stresses the import-
ance of continued surveillance.
The latest Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (APMS) com-
pleted in 2014, a household survey investigating the mental health
of the UK adult population, suggests that general population
levels of PTSD are around 4.4%. Rates remained stable for men,
whereas a sharp decrease was found in women after the age of
24.43 This is contrary to the findings among UK military personnel,
as we found higher rates of PTSD in ex-serving personnel, who tend
to be older than those currently serving; this could represent a
deployment effect that would not be found among the general popu-
lation. Further, men reported higher levels of alcohol misuse than
women. This finding is in line with the APMS study that indicated
that men were drinking at more hazardous levels compared with
women.43 Women reported greater symptoms of CMD (24.3%
versus 21.6%) than men but this difference did not reach statistical
significance (supplementary Table 2). This is in contrast with
previous studies investigating gender differences related to mental
health outcomes among military personnel and in the general
population, whereby CMD are found to be more prevalent in
women than men.44,45
Implications
Alcohol misuse and CMD continue to be the most common mental
health conditions among UK serving and ex-serving personnel. In
general, the prevalence of PTSD has increased from 2004/6. This
appears to be related to higher rates of PTSD among ex-serving per-
sonnel in the latest cohort phase. In addition, ex-serving personnel
are experiencing higher rates of CMD compared with serving per-
sonnel, suggesting that the risk of mental ill health is carried by
those who have left the service. Therefore, our results support the
current focus on providing and improving veteran mental health
services. The UK Ministry of Defence seeks to ensure that, after per-
sonnel join, train and work well, they also leave well, transition
smoothly to civilian life and live well after service.46 The study
data suggests that transition and civilian life may be particularly
problematic for an important minority of UK Service personnel.
As seen previously with regards to mental health legacy issues,
such as those from the Vietnam War, these have taken some time
to reveal themselves. These results reiterate the importance of
taking a lifelong approach to the health and well-being of the
armed forces to ensure that both serving and ex-serving personnel
receive optimal care.
