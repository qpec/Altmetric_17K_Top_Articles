SUMMARY
Sex differences in brain structure and function are of
substantial scientific interest because of sex-related
susceptibility to psychiatric and neurological disor-
ders. Neuroinflammation is a common denominator
of many of these diseases, and thus microglia, as
the brain’s immunocompetent cells, have come into
focus in sex-specific studies. Here, we show differ-
ences in the structure, function, and transcriptomic
and proteomic profiles in microglia freshly isolated
from male and female mouse brains. We show that
male microglia are more frequent in specific brain
areas, have a higher antigen-presenting capacity,
and appear to have a higher potential to respond to
stimuli such as ATP, reflected in higher baseline
outward and inward currents and higher protein
expression of purinergic receptors. Altogether, we
provide a comprehensive resource to generate and
validate hypotheses regarding brain sex differences.
INTRODUCTION
In mammals, sex is defined as a combination of direct effects of
sex chromosomes Y and X and effects of gonadal hormones,
which can be shaped by gene dose and epigenetic processes
(Arnold et al., 2012; Dewing et al., 2003). Sex is an important
biologic variable in preclinical research (Executive Summary of
the Institute of Medicine Report, 2001).
Recognizing this fact is vital because preclinical data inform
the premise and design of clinical studies. Historical reliance
on male rodents in preclinical research (Zucker and Beery,
2010; Landis et al., 2012) has resulted in the generation of incom-
plete data available to guide clinical trials that include female
participants. This is particularly problematic in view of current
knowledge that sex affects health status, including disease
presentation, pathophysiology, and therapeutic response. Sex
steroids regulate the transcription of genes relevant to the devel-
opment and maturation of immune cells, immune responses,
and immune signaling (van Lunzen and Altfeld, 2014). As a result,
the basic inflammatory response differs between the sexes. The
exact nature of these differences and how these differences
contribute to disease incidence and its progression are quite
complex, depending on a multitude of factors, including age,
genetics, and environment. In brain diseases involving an
inflammatory component, the microglial cells—the brain resident
macrophages and phagocytes—play a pivotal role (Wolf et al.,
2017).
Microglia influence brain development, including sexual differ-
entiation (Schafer et al., 2013; Lenz and McCarthy, 2015; Garden
and Campbell, 2016). Recent evidence has demonstrated that
microglia differ in quantity and phenotype between female and
male rodents in some regions of the brain, including hippocam-
pus (Mouton et al., 2002; Schwarz et al., 2012; Lenz et al., 2013;
McCarthy et al., 2015). It was also shown that masculinization of
the brain is dependent upon microglial activation (Lenz et al.,
2013; Welberg 2013). Several studies investigated the sex differ-
ence in response to the immunomodulatory lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) of male and female microglia in vitro and in vivo (Hanamsa-
gar et al., 2017). Hanamsagar et al. (2017) recently reported
transcriptomic data of isolated male and female hippocampal
microglia derived from different developmental stages up to
P60. It was also shown that the absence of the microbiome
has a sex- and time-specific impact on microglia (Thion et al.,
2018). Although global transcriptome analysis is a powerful tech-
nique that can reveal insights into a phenotype of a given cell,
organ or region, RNA levels of a given gene may differ from the
protein expression and eventually might only partially reflect

 the functional phenotype of a cell (Jovanovic et al., 2015;
Schwanha
¨ usser et al., 2011). The predictive value of transcript
expression for corresponding proteins is variable in human brain
samples, reflecting the complex regulation of protein expression
(Bauernfeind and Babbitt, 2017). We therefore provide here
structural, functional, transcriptomic, and proteomic data from
freshly isolated microglia derived from adult (13 weeks old)
brains of male and female mice. Where feasible, we analyzed
hippocampal and cortical microglia separately to capture the
known brain region specificity.
RESULTS
Sex-Specific Structural Differences
Microglial Cell Density Differs between Male and Female
Microglia Depending on Brain Regions
To characterize the effect of sex on microglia density, we labeled
these cells with anti-Iba1 (ionized calcium-binding adaptor mole-
cule 1) antibody and compared male and female mice at 3 and
13 weeks of age in five different brain regions: cortex, hippocam-
pus, amygdala, striatum, and cerebellum (representative micro-
graphs for hippocampus in Figure 1A). In 3-week-old males,
microglia density in the hippocampus (as determined in a defined
plane) was significantly decreased, whereas it was increased in
the amygdala compared with females (Figure 1B, male versus
female, 1-way ANOVA, F[4, 60] = 7.199, p < 0.0001). Several
structures, such as cortex, striatum, and cerebellum, did not
show any differences in microglia density between males and
females. In 13-week-old males, density of microglia in the cortex,
hippocampus, and amygdala was significantly higher compared
with female mice (Figure 1C, male versus female, 1-way ANOVA,
F[1, 52] = 35.56, p < 0.0001), while there was no difference in the
striatum and cerebellum.
Soma Size Differs between Male and Female Microglia
Furthermore, we analyzed the soma size at both developmental
stages in the five brain regions described above (representative
micrographs in Figure 1D). We did not observe significant
differences between 3-week-old males and females (Figure 1E).
In 13-week-old males, the soma size of microglia was larger in
the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala compared with the
females (Figure 1F, male versus female, 1-way ANOVA,
F[1, 52] = 23.9, p < 0.0001), while it was similar in the cerebellum
and striatum (Figures 1E and 1F).
Sex-Specific Functional Differences
Microglia Show Sex-Dependent Differences in Their
Basic Membrane Properties
To compare the basic membrane properties between male and
female microglia, we recorded membrane currents from micro-
glial cells in acute brain slices of the somatosensory cortex

 (layers 2–6) and the hippocampus using the patch-clamp tech-
nique. The microglial cells were identified by green fluorescence
in the transgenic Csf1R-EGFP mouse line (Sasmono et al., 2003).
Figure 2A shows representative current profiles of a female
and male microglia from cortex. On the basis of these record-
ings, we determined the current density-to-voltage relationship
of the measured inward and outward currents (Figure 2B). It is
apparent that male microglia display significantly higher baseline
inward and outward conductance (p < 0.05). Furthermore, mi-
croglia derived from female mice showed a significantly lower
reversal potential, which is indicative of the resting membrane
potential (Student’s t test with Welch’s correction; males:
�43.69 mV, SEM = 1.511, n = 61; females: �48.87 mV, SEM =
2.098, n = 61; p = 0.047) (Figures 2C and S1E).
We did not observed differences between cortical microglia
derived from male or female mice in membrane capacitance
(Figures S1D and S1E, top) or in membrane resistance of the
patched cells (Figure S1F, top). By taking the changes in the
reversal potential into account, both findings indicate a differen-
tial resting state for male and female cortical microglia.
Differences in the Electrophysiological Response to ATP
in Male versus Female Microglia
We tested purinergic signaling by recording membrane current
responses to application of ATP in microglial cells from acutely
isolated cortical and hippocampal brain slices. As previously
described, ATP triggered increases in inward and outward cur-
rents with different kinetics and varying frequency (Figure 2D;
Boucsein et al., 2000). ATP-induced outwardly rectifying cur-
rents were consistently observed and not different in male and
female microglia. They had similar reversal potentials close to
the K+ equilibrium potential, indicative of an activation of a K+
conductance (Figure 2E).
Inward currents often occurred with a delay and were more
frequently observed in male compared with female cortical mi-
croglia. In male microglia, 16 of 27 cells (59%) showed this
response, while in female microglia, 8 of 19 cells showed such
a response (42%). These currents had a reversal potential of
about 0 mV and an average amplitude measured between
voltage steps �80 to �140 mV of 0.970 pA/pF (SEM = 0.210)

Figure 2. Sex-Dependent Membrane Properties
(A) Membrane currents recorded from microglia located in layers 2–6 of the
somatosensory cortex in acute slices. The membrane was clamped to po-
tentials between �170 and 60 mV in 10 mV increments from a holding potential
of �70 mV, with duration of 50 ms for each pulse. Microglia were identified by
their intrinsic GFP fluorescence under the Csf1R promoter.
(B) The graph illustrates the average current density (pA/pF) to voltage (mV)
relationship obtained from 123 microglial cells. Microglia derived from male
mice show significantly higher baseline inward and outward conductance
compared with female mice (p < 0.05 between �170 and �70 and between
�20 and +60 mV).
(C) Distribution of reversal potentials from male (n = 61) and female (n = 62)
microglial cells. Microglial cells derived from female mice showed a signifi-
cantly lower reversal potential compared with male mice (p = 0.048). Average
values indicated at the bottom.
(D) ATP-induced membrane currents were recorded while clamping the
membrane every 5 s to a series of de- and hyperpolarizing voltage steps
ranging from �140 to +60 mV in 20 mV increments, 100 ms in duration. ATP
(1 mM) was applied via the bathing chamber for 1 min as indicated by the bar.
(E) To construct the current density-to-voltage relationship (pA/pF to mV) of the
ATP-activated current component, values before ATP application (C filled
circles) were subtracted from currents at the peak of the response of the
induced inward current (- filled squares) and the peak of the induced outward
current (: filled triangles) as indicated in the recording in (D). No significant
differences in the reversal potential were observed between sexes concerning
outward conductance upon ATP application.
(F) Microglia derived from male mice showed a significantly higher inward
conductance compared with female at the voltage steps between �140 and
�80 mV (p < 0.05).
At least three animals per group were used, and the number of recorded mi-
croglia was 28 for males and 19 for females (Student’s t test with Welch’s
correction, *p < 0.05).

 in males and �0.450 pA/pF (SEM = 0.148) in females (Student’s t
test with Welch’s correction; p < 0.05, between voltage steps be-
tween �140 and �80 mV; Figure 2F). On the basis of their delay,
these delayed activated currents are most likely due to P2X7
activation on microglia (Ousingsawat et al., 2015). These findings
suggest different functional expression of the P2X system be-
tween male and female microglia in the cortical region.
In hippocampal acute slices, we observed no difference in the
passive membrane properties (Figures S1A, S1B, and S1D–S1F,
bottom) or in P2X- or P2Y-mediated membrane current changes
(Figure S1C) between male and female microglia.
Basal In Situ Phagocytosis Is Similar in Male and Female
Microglia
Another important function of microglia is their phagocytic activ-
ity. Therefore, we quantified the engulfment of fluorescent beads
by microglia on acute brain slices. We compared the phagocytic
activity of microglia in cortical slices of 13-week-old male and
female mice. We used the previously established in situ phago-
cytosis assay analyzed by confocal microscopy and three-
dimensional (3D) reconstruction, which allowed us to calculate
the baseline phagocytic index of microglia (Figure 3A; Video
S1). As shown in Figure 3B, baseline microglial phagocytosis in-
dex was not different between males and females in cortical sli-
ces. The same was true for the phagocytosis activity of microglia
in hippocampal slices (data not shown).
Male Microglia Show Higher Antigen-Presenting
Potential
Microglia are the major immune cell population in the brain,
which processes and presents antigen peptides via major histo-
compatibility complex (MHC) molecules. We investigated the an-
tigen-presenting potential of microglia freshly isolated from male
and female cortex and hippocampus using flow cytometry. The
dye-coupled monoclonal anti-mouse antibodies against CD45
and CD11b served to identify microglia as CD11b+, CD45low
cells (Figure 3C). In this population, we characterized the expres-
sion of MHCI and MHCII. MHCI expression was higher in male
microglia in cortex and hippocampus (Figure 3D; Student’s
t test, male versus female, hippocampus: 645.3 ± 31.72 versus
442.1 ± 35.74; cortex: 752.2 ± 64.85 versus 506.8 ± 30.28).
Higher MHCII expression in male microglia was observed only
in the cortex (Figure 3D; Student’s t test, male versus female,
cortex: 698.5 ± 92.74 versus 390.6 ± 39.29). Altogether, our
data suggest that naive male microglia have a higher antigen-
presenting capacity.
Sex-Specific Transcriptional Difference
Here we compared the transcriptomic profile of freshly isolated
microglia from male and female hippocampus and cortex. Using
next-generation sequencing, we sequenced polyA-selected
mRNAs from microglia isolated from hippocampus and frontal
lobe with four replicates for females and three replicates for
males. In total �223.2 million paired end reads with 82%–95%
unique fragment mappability were generated. We found good
reproducibility between the replicates (Figure S2A). Principal-
components analysis (PCA) showed a very clear separation of
expression between the two brain regions and the two sexes
(Figure S2C).
First, we noted that there was quite a difference in the expres-
sion profile in males and females between the two brain regions.
We found 1,109 genes differentially expressed between males

 and females exclusively in hippocampus and 55 genes differen-
tially expressed exclusively in the cortex, whereas 46 genes were
differentially regulated in both regions between males and fe-
males (Figure 4A; adjusted p < 0.01, jlog2 fold change (LFC)j >
0.5). The scatterplot shows a high correlation of sex-specific
fold changes in the two regions (Figure 4B, plot in front). The
four Y chromosome-specific genes show the high dynamic
range of our data (Figure 4B, plot in back).
For the cortex, we detected 72 genes expressed at a higher
level and 27 expressed at a lower level in male compared with fe-
male microglia. In the hippocampus, the difference in the tran-
scriptomic profile was much more pronounced, and we found
324 genes expressed at a higher level and 867 genes at a lower
level in male compared with female microglia. The heatmaps
(Figures 4C and 4D) show the top 50 differentially regulated
genes between male and female microglia for both regions.
We also confirmed our transcriptomic data with qRT-PCR from
an additional ten animals with five selected differentially ex-
pressed genes in hippocampus and cortex (Figure S2D).
To identify the biological processes differentially regulated in
both sexes, we subjected the genes expressed at higher and
at lower levels to Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. In the cortex,
we restricted the GO enrichment analysis only to the genes ex-
pressed at higher levels in males because of the small number
of lower expressed genes. In male microglia, ‘‘transcription fac-
tor activity’’ (GO 0000982, 989, 977) and ‘‘histone demethylation
and deacetylation’’ (GO 0071557/8 and GO 0016575) were
among the 30 GO terms overrepresented in the genes expressed
at higher levels in the cortex (Figure 5A). The GO analysis of mi-
croglia from hippocampus revealed among others the following
GO terms overrepresented in the genes expressed at higher
levels in male microglia: ‘‘regulation of defense response to bac-
teria’’ (GO 1900424), ‘‘insulin receptor pathway’’ (GO 0008286),
and ‘‘glia cell differentiation’’ (GO 0010001) as well as ‘‘ATP bind-
ing’’ (GO 0005524) (Figure 5B). The GO terms ‘‘GABA and
Glutamate receptor activity’’ (GO 0007214/5 and 0004890),
‘‘ubiquitin protein activity’’ (GO 006130/1) and ‘‘magnesium ion
transport’’ (GO 0015095/15693) were overrepresented in the fe-
male microglia gene set (Figure S3A). For the complete datasets,
see Table S1.
Because a transcriptomic profile of male versus female hippo-
campal microglia was recently published for P60 (Hanamsagar
et al., 2017), we took the opportunity to add another develop-
mental time point. We found a strong correlation between our
13-week-old mice/microglia (polyA-enriched mRNAs) and the

 published P60 data (total RNA), with a correlation coefficient of
0.79 for male hippocampal microglia (Figure S4A). About 1,500
protein coding genes were detected with more than a 16-fold dif-
ference between the two experimental approaches. It is possible
that some of the differences stem from technical or actual bio-
logical differences. To further evaluate the two datasets, we
analyzed the length distribution and functions of the genes that
differ between the two datasets. Figure S4B shows that the
polyA-exclusive genes (dark blue) form longer transcripts. GO
terms overrepresented in the genes expressed at a higher level
in 13 weeks versus P60 related these changes among others
to the GO terms ‘‘startle response,’’ ‘‘learning,’’ ‘‘memory,’’ and
‘‘synaptic plasticity’’ (Figure S4C).
Finally, we also analyzed the transcriptomic differences be-
tween hippocampus- and cortex-derived microglia in males
and females separately. We expected a regional difference to
dominate over sex differences. In the heatmaps (Figures S3B
and S3C), we show the 50 most significant differential regu-
lated genes in male and in female microglia derived from cortex
and hippocampus. More than half of the genes (64%) came up
in both male and female datasets (e.g., c1qc2, sema5a, gpr161,
prox1), showing the similarity in the transcriptomic profile. In
addition, when we performed GO enrichment analysis, we
found that 30%–50% of the significant GO terms are the

Sex-Specific Translational
Difference
To determine the steady-state protein
levels in microglia from both sexes,
we estimated protein composition of
the microglial cells by mass spectrom-
etry (MS)-based proteomics and label-
free quantification (LFQ) analysis. We
analyzed the differences of protein abun-
dance, comparing the normalized inten-
sity on distinct proteins from four different
samples per group. We pooled �500,000 microglial cells from
three brains in order to obtain enough material for MS for one
sample. Because of the lower sensitivity of proteomics versus
genomics applications, microglia cells taken from the whole
brain were analyzed. Therefore, we could perform the proteo-
mic analysis only on whole-brain microglia. We identified
5,500 proteins per sample on average in a single-shot anal-
ysis. In total there were 6,208 proteins identified among all
samples. We performed quantification in a label-free format
using the Max Quant algorithms, using the normalized inten-
sity values (LFQ intensity). We included only proteins that
were quantified in at least three experiments in one condition.
Analysis of the MS data resulted in 4,627 proteins for statisti-
cal quantification. Pairwise comparison of all the samples
against each other resulted in high Pearson coefficients,
indicating

accuracy

(Figure S2A).
Applying Student’s t test comparison, 268 proteins were found
to be expressed at significantly higher levels in male microglia
and 96 proteins at significantly higher levels in female microglia
derived from whole brain (almost 10% of the dataset) (Table
S2; adjusted p < 0.01, jLFCj > 1).

analysis of the proteins with a higher expression level in male
microglia revealed that they belong to interconnected pathways
implicated into regulation of cellular functions (Figure S5A).
A number of proteins highly expressed in male microglia are
myosin
related
(Myh14,
Myh9,
Myo18a,
Myo1b,
Myo1c,
Myo1f, and Myo1g) proteins that contribute to cell stability, traf-
ficking, shape, and size. This might be reflected on a pheno-
typic level by the increase in soma size of male microglia
(Figures 1E and 1F) and higher motility as shown by others
(Yanguas-Casa
´ s et al., 2018). We also found P2X purinoceptors
4 and 7 and P2Y purinoceptor 12 (P2RX7, P2RX4, and P2YR12,
respectively), which are related to purinergic receptor signaling
and mediate current responses to ATP, expressed at signifi-
cantly higher levels in male microglia. The electrophysiological
recordings suggest that the P2Y7-mediated response to ATP
is more pronounced in male microglia. We also found proteins
related with Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways expressed at
higher levels in male microglia such as TLR2, 3, 7, 9, S100a8
and S100a9, Prkdc, and Xrccr5, which suggest higher respon-
siveness of male microglia to immunological stimuli. One of the
proteins enriched in female microglia was Irf3, which would hint

toward a higher potential to respond to

and IFN-beta) related processes. More-
over, other proteins of the same pathway
are expressed at higher levels in male
microglia (Prkdc and Xrccr5; pathway
analysis, Figure S5B). Taken together
this might be a prominent example that
differences in male and female microglia
can originate from a different temporal
expression of molecules belonging to the same pathway
(Figure S5C).
The differentially expressed proteins were used for further GO
analysis (Table S3).
How Are the Functional Differences between Male and
Female Microglia Reflected in Their Transcriptomic and
Proteomic Profiles?
Because we had the chance to perform transcriptomic and pro-
teomic analysis within the same experimental setting using the
same strain of mice, we felt confident to analyze how much
they are reflected within each other. Because of technical and lo-
gistic limitations (cell number required for proteomics versus cell
number required for transcriptomics), we performed proteomics
from whole brain and transcriptomics from hippocampus and
medial prefrontal cortex separately. We sought to investigate
whether the differences in the sex-specific RNA signature of
either brain region would also be reflected in the sex-specific
whole-brain proteomic profiles. Although technical replicates
for both RNA and protein datasets correlated highly, we could
not find a striking correlation between the datasets (Figure S2A).
A search of GO terms and genes and proteins within the datasets
revealed only a few common ones in the proteomic and tran-
scriptomic analysis. For example, the GO term ‘‘Rho GTPase
Cell Reports 24, 2773–2783, September 4, 2018
2779
 binding’’ (GO 0017048) was overrepresented in the dataset from
male microglia proteome and male microglia hippocampal tran-
scriptome. Also, one Y-linked gene, Ddx3y (DEAD-box helicase
3, Y-linked), was at a higher expression level in the male tran-
scriptome of both cortical and hippocampal microglia and in
the male proteome of whole-brain microglia, confirming its mi-
croglial origin in males. When we compared the top 30 genes
with higher expression levels in male microglia in the proteomics
and transcriptomic analysis, we found S100a8 at a higher level in
both male microglia proteome and male microglia cortical tran-
scriptome. Pkn1 was found to be at a higher level in the male pro-
teome and in male hippocampal and cortical transcriptome.
However, most of the genes and proteins and GO terms were
only present either in the proteome or the transcriptome dataset
and did not show up in both datasets at all. In addition, we iso-
lated CD11b cells from the whole brain and performed RNA
sequencing. However, the correlation between transcriptome
and proteome was equally low comparing whole-brain microglia
mRNA and protein profile (data not shown). The purity of the iso-
lated cells was tested using CD11b, CD45, Ly6G, and Ly6C la-
beling and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis
(gating strategy, Figure S6). We monitored gene expression
values in different cell-type specific modules defined by Fried-
man et al. (2018), and our dataset revealed a high correlation
only in the microglia module (Table S1; Figure S2B). This was
confirmed by an independent FACS analysis: only approximately
0.5%–1.8% of the CD11b population also expressed Ly6G,
which is a neutrophil marker (Figure S6B). In conclusion, the
contamination rate was very low in all the samples from males
and females alike. We therefore conclude that the differences
between male and female datasets are indeed based on the
98% CD11b-positive microglial population.
DISCUSSION
In the present study, we aimed to provide a comprehensive over-
view of the transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of male and fe-
male microglia and compare them with cellular characteristics
and function. We provide a comprehensive data source to the
scientific community for future studies in this field.
Overall, male microglia are more frequent in specific brain
areas such as the hippocampus and cortex at 3 and 13 weeks,
have bigger somata at 13 weeks, and appear to be more respon-
sive to stimuli or ‘‘ready to go.’’ This is reflected for example by a
higher expression of MHCI and MHCII on cortical and hippocam-
pal male microglia. Moreover, male microglia had higher base-
line outward and inward currents as well as a higher response
to ATP in a P2X-dependent manner measured in cortical slices.
In addition, proteomic analysis of whole-brain microglia revealed
a higher expression of the P2X4, P2X7, and P2Y12 receptors in
males.
A few studies have addressed sex differences in microglia
density in different brain regions. Schwarz and Bilbo (2012) re-
ported that female Sprague-Dawley rats have higher number of
microglia in juvenile and adult stages. On the contrary, Acaz-
Fonseca et al. (2015) indicated that females have lower density
of Iba1+ cells with a nonreactive morphology in the cortical brain
injury mouse model. We show that in the healthy brain, microglia
density is increased in male hippocampus at both develop-
mental stages (3 and 13 weeks). These data indicate that the
sex difference in microglia density and soma size is dependent
upon brain region, age, and species.
Microglial phagocytic activity was previously shown to be
more pronounced in female compared with male mice at P0 in
hippocampus (Nelson et al., 2017). Perez-Pouchoulen et al.
(2015) also suggested that there was no sex difference in fre-
quency of phagocytic cups in the cerebellar layers at the P17
developmental stage. We show that the phagocytic activity of
microglial cells in the adult brain was not different between males
and females, indicating that microglial phagocytosis is constant
after P17 or at least in adult males and females. Microglia ex-
presse several P2Y receptors, which are involved in phagocy-
tosis and motility (Hidetoshi et al., 2012). Phagocytosis is
controlled by P2Y6 receptor signaling, which was not differently
expressed between male and female microglia. In contrast,
P2Y12 receptor expression, which controls microglia motility
(Wu et al., 2007), was expressed at a higher level in males
compared with females in the proteomics analysis, implying
that male microglia may have higher motility capacity. ATP stim-
ulation triggered larger inward K+ currents in male microglia,
which indicates enhanced P2X receptor-mediated signaling.
Indeed, proteomic analysis showed that P2X4 and P2X7 recep-
tors are highly expressed in male microglia compared with fe-
male. A very recent study showed that female microglia display
a neuroprotective phenotype and that transplanted female mi-
croglia protected male brains from ischemic stroke (Villa et al.,
2018). This is in line with our finding that male microglia seem
to be more reactive already under physiological conditions.
One such example is the higher baseline level of S100a8 in
male microglia in both datasets (mRNA in the cortex, protein in
whole brain). S100a8 is a calcium- and zinc-binding protein,
which plays a prominent role in the regulation of inflammatory
processes and immune response. In microglia, S100a8/a9 is
known to be a TLR4-binding protein and regulates the secretion
of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Ma et al., 2017). Dysregulation of
S100a8/a9 on microglia has been shown in different disease
conditions (Erny et al., 2015; Foster et al., 2006; Gonzalez-
Pena et al., 2016), indicating that S100a8/a9 is expressed by mi-
croglia and of functional importance. Interestingly a recent study
using micro array on microglia isolated from adult C57BL/6 mice
showed higher expression of S100a8 mRNA in females (Thion
et al., 2018). The isolation and sorting of the cells was different
(FACS versus magnetic-activated cell sorting [MACS] in our
study) as well as RNA isolation and preparation. More important,
the authors discuss that sexual dimorphism in adult microglia
showed some variability across housing facilities within their
own study. This highlights the importance of the microbiome
as a microglia-modulating factor, as they demonstrate in their
study.
Pattern recognition molecules such as TLR2, 3, 7, and 9 are
higher expressed in male versus female microglia, as revealed
by the proteomics analysis, but did not show up in the transcrip-
tomic analysis. We showed by FACS analysis that MHCI and II
are highly expressed on male microglia. The MHC expression
modulations were not present in proteomic or transcriptomic
analysis. On the RNA level, we showed enrichment of genes in
2780
Cell Reports 24, 2773–2783, September 4, 2018
 the male dataset that belong to biological processes such as
transcription factor activity, histone demethylation, and deacety-
lation as well as ATP binding and regulation of defense response
to bacteria. Our combined findings from proteome, transcrip-
tome, and functional analyses support the previously reported
findings of higher immune response of male microglia after an
immune challenge with LPS (Loram et al., 2012). On the other
hand, we found indications toward a shorter lifespan of male mi-
croglia related to the higher expression of Inpp5d and mTOR (GO
term ‘‘determination of adult lifespan’’) paralleled by lower
expression of Ercc1 both found in the proteomic dataset. This
might be in line with the reported developmental index of micro-
glia on the basis of transcriptomic data, where male microglia are
described as developmentally delayed compared with female
microglia (Hanamsagar et al., 2017). Here we propose that the
suggested delayed developmental program in male microglia
could also be attributed to a shorter lifespan of these cells.
Although we emphasize here the sex differences, we would
like to highlight that similarities with regard to developmental
stage and brain regions are also evident and possibly highly
conserved between sexes to ensure similar proper functionality
of executive processes. More than half of the top 50 genes
and 30% of the top 30 GO terms were differentially regulated
in both male and female microglia when we compared the brain
regions hippocampus and cortex using transcriptomic analysis.
When we compared our 13-week dataset with the published P60
dataset of hippocampal male microglia, we found a high correla-
tion between the datasets. However, we also detected a signifi-
cant number of genes differently regulated. With our conservative
cut-off, we identified only 6 significantly differentially regulated
genes between males and females in the data set of Hanamsa-
gar et al. (2017) (of which 3 were from chrY and 4 had also
been identified as differentially expressed in our data). We
detected 1,369 genes with 16-fold higher transcripts per million
(TPM) in our data, while in the study of Hanamsagar et al. (2017),
only 118 were detected. We also detected 138 highly expressed
genes in our data that had read counts of zero in P60. In the P60
study, only 2 genes were highly expressed and had no read
counts in our study. Noticeably, a major difference between
the two experiments is the RNA enrichment/depletion strategy
(polyA mRNAs versus total RNA with rRNA depletion). Further-
more, we used paired end sequencing and approximately double
the amount of fragments. However, it is likely that the differences
between the P60 and 13-week datasets do not stem solely from
different protocols and data quality. For example, the GO term
‘‘startle response’’ is overrepresented in the 13-week dataset,
and it was shown in behavior studies that the response to a star-
tle is age dependent (Young et al., 2010; Shoji et al., 2016). More-
over, the estrus cycle has an impact on gene expression.
Because we did not control for estrus cycle, we cannot rule
out that at least part of the difference between the studies could
also stem from a different estrus cycle state (Yagi et al., 2017).
When interpreting transcriptomic results, the assumption is
frequently made that the expression level of a transcript should
correspond to the respective protein level. However, the rela-
tionship between these two aspects of molecular phenotype
has yet to be fully understood. In fact, the correlation between
transcript expression levels and their protein products has
generally been found to be quite low and may vary across tissues
and cell types (de Sousa Abreu et al., 2009; Maier et al., 2009;
Nagaraj et al., 2011; Vogel and Marcotte, 2012; Payne, 2015)
and is lowest in the brain (Schwanha
¨ usser et al., 2011).
Proteomic and transcriptomic data are a great resource to test
and generate hypotheses. However, functional data are needed
to ensure meaningful conclusions. We provide here a sex-spe-
cific transcriptomic dataset for hippocampal and cortical micro-
glia as well as a sex-specific proteomic dataset for whole-brain
microglia. We also show that our data are a great resource for
the scientific community to generate new hypotheses. We
have already supported some of these hypotheses with func-
tional and structural data; others will be tested in future studies
to explore gender-based therapeutic strategies targeting micro-
glia cells in neuroinflammatory, neurodevelopmental, and neuro-
degenerative diseases.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Animals
All mice used for the present study were on a C57BL/6J genetic background of both sexes and animals were handled according to
governmental (LaGeSo) and internal (MDC) rules and regulations. For the electrophysiological study, C57BL/6J background Csf1R-
EGFP expression mice were used to allow detection of microglial cells by their fluorescence. The mice were kept in our animal facility
with 12 hours of light and dark cycle with food and water ad libitum.
Ethics Statement
All procedures involving the handling of living animals were performed in strict accordance with the German Animal Protection Law
and were approved by the Regional Office for Health and Social Services in Berlin (Landesamt f€
ur Gesundheit und Soziales, Berlin,
Germany, Permit Number T0014/08, X9023/12). Adult mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation or intraperitoneal injection of
pentobarbital (Narcoren, Merial GmbH, Hallbergmoos, Germany) for following experiments. All efforts were made to minimize
suffering.

 METHOD DETAILS
Iba1 Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy
Animals were perfused with 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% PFA in PBS, decapitated and sectioned in the
coronal plane at 40 mm thickness. Free-floating 40mm thick sections were incubated in 5% donkey serum and 0.1% triton-X in
tris-buffered saline solution (TBSplus). Iba1 primary antibody was prepared in TBSplus at the following dilution: rabbit anti-Iba1
(Wako chemicals GmbH, Neuss, Germany, product code: 019-19741) 1:400 and sections were incubated with the primary antibodies
over-night at 4�C. Secondary antibodies were also prepared in TBSplus at the following dilutions: donkey anti-rabbit Cy3 (Dianova,
Hamburg, Germany) 1:200, cell nucleus were stained using 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Dianova, Hamburg, Germany)
1:500 and sections were incubated with secondary antibodies at room temperature for two hours. Images were acquired with a
confocal microscope equipped with a 10X objective using LASAF software. Pictures were taken throughout the entire thickness
of the slice by Z stack analysis (8 mm z-step size, 10 steps), covering the surface of the respective region. The number of microglia
cells per/mm2 were quantified using Fiji ImageJ software (NIH, Maryland, USA). A total of four slices per animal we sampled for the
analysis.
Acute brain slice preparation for electrophysiological recordings
Acute cortical brain slices were prepared as described earlier (Boucsein et al., 2003). In brief, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislo-
cation and the brain was removed and cooled down in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM): NaCl, 134; KCl,
2.5; MgCl2, 1.3; CaCl2, 2; K2HPO4, 1.25; NaHCO3, 26; D-glucose, 10; pH 7.4; gassed with 95% O2/ 5% CO2. Brains were mounted on
a vibratome (HM650V, Thermo Scientific, Massachusetts, USA) and 250 mm thick coronal brain slices were made and kept at room
temperature for experiments for up to 5 h.
Electrophysiological recordings
For electrophysiological recordings, conventional patch-clamp amplifiers were used (EPC9 and EPC10, HEKA Elektronik,
Lambrecht, Germany). Microglia in layers 2 – 6 of the somatosensory cortex and the hippocampus were identified by their green
fluorescence on an epifluorescent microscope. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glasses and had resistances of 4 to
6 MU. The following intracellular solution was used (in mM): KCl, 130; MgCl2, 2; CaCl2, 0.5; Na-ATP, 2; EGTA, 5; HEPES, 10 and
sulforhodamine 101, 0.01 (Sigma Aldrich) and had an osmolarity of 280 - 290 mOsm/L adjusted to a pH of 7.3 with KOH. As extra-
cellular solution the following ACSF was used (in mM): NaCl, 134; KCl, 2.5; MgCl2, 1.3; CaCl2, 2; K2HPO4, 1.25; NaHCO3, 26;
D-glucose, 10; pH 7.4; with an osmolarity of 310 - 320 mOsm/L and gassed with 95% O2/ 5% CO2. Experiments with series re-
sistances less than 50 MU were used for data analysis. All experiments were performed in voltage-clamp configuration. To obtain
current-voltage curves during continuous recordings, the membrane was clamped every 5 s from a holding potential of 40 mV to a
series of de- and hyperpolarizing voltage pulses (100 ms) ranging from �140 mV to +60 mV with 20 mV increments. For evaluation
of baseline microglial membrane properties, we clamped the membrane from a holding potential of �70 mV to potentials
between �170 mV and +60 mV with 10 mV increments and a duration of 50 ms for each pulse. All currents were online Bes-
sel-filtered at 2.9 kHz. Capacitive transients from the pipette were compensated online via the patch clamp amplifier (Cfast)
whereas membrane capacity and series resistance (Cslow) were not compensated. The liquid junction potential between intra-
and extracellular solutions was – 3 mV calculated by Patchers Power Tools (Mendez & Wurriehausen, Gottingen, Germany)
and Igor Pro 7 software (Wavemetrics, Portland, OR, USA). Membrane capacitance was quantified based on an exponential fit
of the current decay in response to a 10 mV test pulse. The same pulse was used to quantify series resistance from the peak
amplitude of the membrane capacitance currents. Comparison of membrane currents between different groups were always
normalized to the membrane capacitance. The data for male microglia have been published as control for 5xFAD male microglia
in a recent paper with focus on Alzheimer’s disease (Wendt et al., 2017).
In situ phagocytosis assay
Quantification of microglial phagocytic activity in acute cortical and hippocampal brain slices of 130 mm thickness was conducted
in male and female wild-type C57BL/6 mice. We analyzed randomly chosen fields of views from cortical (layers I - II and cortical layers
III – VI) and hippocampal areas. 13 week old male and female wild-type C57BL/6 mice were analyzed (n = 3 each sex, respectively).
Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the brain was removed and cooled down in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid
(ACSF) containing (in mM): NaCl, 134; KCl, 2.5; MgCl2, 1.3; CaCl2, 2; K2HPO4, 1.25; NaHCO3, 26; D-glucose, 10; pH 7.4; gassed
with 95% O2/ 5% CO2. Brains were mounted on a vibratome (HM650V, Thermo Scientific, Massachusetts, USA) and 130 mm thick
coronal brain slices were sliced. After dissection, cortical sections were kept at room temperature for experiments for 2 h. Next, acute
brain slices were incubated with a suspension of FCS-coated Bright Blue fluorescent carboxylated microspheres (4.5 mm diameter,
Polysciences). Prior to incubation, the bright blue fluorescent carboxylated microspheres were opsonized with FCS by shaking at
1,000 rpm (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5417R- Rotor FA45-30-11; rotor radius metric: 9.5 cm) for 30 min at RT. After centrifugation of
opsonized beads for 2 min at 3,000 rpm, supernatant was removed, and microspheres were washed in PBS and resuspended in
HBSS. Cortical and hippocampal sections were incubated with 2.45 3 106 microspheres (in a volume of 500 ml of HBSS) at 37�C
for 1 h. Lastly, sections were intensively washed with 0.1 M PBS (3 3 20 min) and finally fixed with 4% PFA for 1 h. After fixation,
e3
Cell Reports 24, 2773–2783.e1–e6, September 4, 2018
 immunostainings for microglia using an anti-Iba1 antibody (Wako Pure Chemicals) was conducted. At first, a permeabilisation buffer
containing 2% Triton X-100, 2% bovine serum albumin and 10% normal donkey serum in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was
applied for 4 h, which was followed by the incubation with the donkey anti-goat Iba1 antibody (1:600; Wako Pure Chemicals) in a
dilution buffer (1:10 of permeabilisation buffer in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4) at 4�C overnight. Thereafter, sections were incubated with
the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor� 488-labeled donkey anti-goat antibody (Dianova, Germany; 1:200 in dilution buffer) for 2h at
RT. After washing, slices were mounted in Aqua-Poly/Mount (Polysciences). Confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed
on a Leica TCS SPE using a 20X oil immersion objective. We acquired 20 mm thick z stacks at 1 mm intervals beginning from the sur-
face of the slices.
Data analysis to assess microglial phagocytic activity was performed using Imaris 6.3.1 (Bitplane, Z€
urich, Switzerland). The Iba1-
positive volumes of high-resolution SPE confocal microscopy stacks were 3D surface rendered by application of a threshold value of
40 and a background subtraction value of 90 mm. Adjustments of the settings were done with blinded samples. Microspheres were
detected as spots and counted automatically by the ‘‘Split into surface object’’-plugin. All beads having their center located within a
given rendered Iba1 volume were considered to be phagocytosed by microglia. The phagocytic index was calculated as followed:
nPM*104/ VIba-1 where nPM is the total number of phagocytosed microspheres and VIba-1 the Imaris-rendered volume of Iba1 fluores-
cence in mm3. For statistical analysis, GraphPad Prism 6 (La Jolla, USA) was used. We performed statistical analysis applying one-
way ANOVA followed by a posthoc Tukey test for multiple comparisons of both sexes. To illustrate the method, we added a video in
the supplementary material section.
Flow cytometry analysis
13 week old male and female animals were perfused under deep anesthesia transcardially with 1x Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)
and brains were removed. The hippocampus and frontal cortex were extracted and homogenized in dissection buffer (1x HBSS
(Thermo Scientific), 45% glucose, 1M HEPES) and cell pellets were resuspended in 25 mL of 22% Percoll (GE Healthcare, Little Chal-
font, UK). 5 mL PBS was added as a layer on top. Centrifugation was performed for 20 min at 950 g with full acceleration and no
breaks. Myelin cloud and rest of the supernatant were removed. Pellets were resuspended in ice-cold FACS buffer and filtered
with 70 mm cell strainer. The cell pellet was resuspended at 106 cells/ml and stained with dye-coupled monoclonal anti-mouse
antibodies: CD45, CD11b, MHCI, and MHCII. (eBioscience, San Diego, USA) for 20 min at 4�C. After the incubation, cells were imme-
diately acquired on a LSRII flow cytometer (BD Bioscience, San Jose, USA) and data was analyzed using FlowJo v10 software (Tree
Star). Statistical analysis were performed applying two-way repeated-measures ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test for
comparisons of both sexes. Significance was defined as * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001.; **** p < 0.0001. All error bars are given
as the standard error of the mean.
Magnetic cell sorting (MACS) of microglial cells
Under deep anesthesia, animals were transcardially perfused with ice-cold PBS. After decapitation, the brains were removed and
frontal cortex and hippocampus were dissected in ice-cold Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS, GIBCO, Invitrogen, Karlsruhe,
Germany). Single cell suspension of hippocampus and frontal cortex were homogenized in dissection buffer (1x HBSS (Thermo
Scientific), 45% glucose, 1M HEPES) and the pellets were resuspended in ice-cold percoll solution composed of percoll (GE Health-
care, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK) and myelin gradient buffer, a layer of PBS was applied on top and centrifuged at 950 g,
4�C no brake and full acceleration. The cells were washed in ice-cold MACS-buffer (PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 2 mM EDTA)
and stained with anti-mouse CD11b magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) at 4�C for 20 minutes. Due to
limitation of cell number, three hippocampi were pooled and total cells were passed through large-sized MACS columns (Miltenyi
Biotech, Bergisch Glabdach, Germany). The flow through was discarded and the cells were flushed out of the column in MACS buffer
and pulled down by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in either 1 mL TRIzol (Thermo Scientific, Schwerte, Germany) and snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at �80�C for subsequent lysis for RNA extraction or put into PBS and subjected to protein extrac-
tion for the Proteomic analysis.
Purity analysis of CD11b+ MACS sorted cells using Flow Cytometry
CD11b+ MACS sorted brain and blood cells (see method section: MACS sorting of microglia) were resuspend in FACS buffer (2%
FCS in PBS) and stained with dye-coupled monoclonal anti-mouse antibodies: CD45, CD11b, Ly6G, and Ly6C. (eBioscience, San
Diego, USA) for 20 min at 4�C. After the incubation, cells were immediately acquired on a LSRII flow cytometer (BD Bioscience, San
Jose, USA) and data was analyzed using FlowJo v10 software (Tree Star).
mRNA library preparation and sequencing
In order not to compromise the results just by mere cell number, the same amount of cells for each sex were used for RNA extraction.
Total RNA integrity and quality was assessed with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using an RNA 6000 Nano LabChip kit (Agilent Technol-
ogies, Ltd). In total, 16 strand-specific polyA enriched RNA libraries were prepared (four biological replicates for each treatment)
using the KAPA Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington
MA, USA). Briefly, mRNA molecules were enriched from 50-250ng of total RNA using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads
(Kapa Biosystems). Obtained mRNA was subsequently fragmented and the first-strand cDNA was synthesized using a reverse

 transcriptase and random hexamers. Second cDNA synthesis was performed to generate double-stranded cDNA (dsDNA). Adeno-
sines were added to the 30 ends of dsDNA and adapters were ligated (adapters from NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). Following the adaptor
ligation, uracil was digested by USER enzyme from NEB (Ipswich, MA, USA) in a loop structure of adaptor. Adapters containing DNA
fragments were amplified by PCR using NEB starters (Ipswich MA, USA). Library evaluation was done with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer
using the Agilent DNA High Sensitivity chip (Agilent Technologies, Ltd.) Mean library size was 300bp. Libraries were quantified using a
Quantus fluorometer and QuantiFluor double stranded DNA System (Promega). Libraries were run in the rapid run flow cell and were
paired-end sequenced (2x100bp) on HiSeq 1500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA 92122 USA).
qRT-PCR validation of selected genes
For qRT-PCR validation of selected genes, CD11b+ MACS sorted cells were used for RNA extraction (see method section of MACS
sorting and RNA extraction). After RNA extraction, first stranded cDNA synthesis was done with the SuperScript II reverse transcrip-
tase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) using oligo-dT primers12-18 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Quantitative real-time PCR reactions were performed in a 7500 Fast Real-Time thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad,
USA) using the SYBR Select Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, USA). The expression data was normalized to TBP gene
expression for each sample. Following Primers were used for analysis: S100a8 forward 50-CCGTCTTCAAGACATCGTTTGA-30,

Protein extraction and Mass spectrometry analysis
Microglia primary cells from four different male/female mice were pelleted in PBS. The samples were solubilized in Laemmli buffer
(LB) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteome was focused in one gel band and was processed as described elsewhere (Shev-
chenko, Tomas et al., 2006, Kanashova, Popp et al., 2015), with the modification of using an automated HTS PAL system (CTC An-
alytics, Switzerland). Peptides were extracted, purified and stored on reversed-phase (C18) StageTips (Rappsilber et al., 2007). After
elution, the peptides were lyophilized and resuspended in 0.1% Formic Acid / 3% Acetonitrile. Protein analysis by label-free quan-
tification (LFQ). Peptides were then separated in a nano EasyLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a 0.1 3 200 mm MonoCap C18
HighResolution Ultra column (GL Sciences, Japan) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min with a gradient from 5 to 95% B in 360 min. The
UHPLC was coupled online to an Orbitrap Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for mass spectrometry analysis.
The mass spectrometer was set to acquire full-scan MS spectra (300–1700 m/z) at a resolution of 17,500 after accumulation to an
automated gain control (AGC) target value of 1 3 106 and maximum injection time of 20 ms, and was operated in a data-dependent
acquisition mode, selecting the ten most abundant ions for MS/MS analysis, with dynamic exclusion enabled (20 s). Charge state
screening was enabled, and unassigned charge states, and single charged precursors were excluded. Ions were isolated using a
quadrupole mass filter with a 2 m/z isolation window. A maximum injection time of 60 ms was set. HCD fragmentation was per-
formed at normalized collision energy (NCE) of 26%. The recorded spectra were searched against a mouse database from Uniprot
(January 2017) using the MaxQuant software package (Version 1.5.2.8) (Cox and Mann 2008) with fixed modifications set to carba-
mylation of cysteines and variable modifications set to methionine oxidation. Peptide tolerance was 20 ppm and the minimum ratio
for LFQ was set to 2. The false-discovery rate was set to 1% on protein and peptide level. Statistical analysis of the dataset was per-
formed using both R-statistical software package (version 3.4.1) and Perseus software (version 1.6.0.7). For data analysis, first, pro-
teins that were only identified by site or were potential contaminants were excluded. Only those proteins that were found in at least
three biological replicates for either female or male microglia were used for column wise imputation from a normal distribution and
subsequent statistical analysis. For this a two-sample t test was performed with a permutation based FDR < 0.01. Abundance
changes with a p value < 0.05 and a minimum fold change of 2 were considered significant (Table S4). The GO analysis was carried
out as described above (for mRNAs): significantly, differentially regulated proteins (corresponding Ensembl gene IDs) were used as
target and all other proteins captured by proteomics experiment were considered as a background. Protein IDs that matched several
gene IDs were removed from the analysis.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Bioinformatic analysis of the RNA seq data
Paired-end RNA-Seq reads were mapped to the mouse reference genome GCRM38/mm10 with STAR (2.4.2a-foss-2015a) using the
following parameters ‘—outFilterMultimapNmax 20 —alignSJoverhangMin 8 —alignSJDBoverhangMin 1 –outfilterMismatchNmax
999 —outFilterMismatchNovelLmax 0.04 —alignIntronMin 20 —alignIntronMax 10^6 —alignMatesGapMax 10^6’ (Dobin, Davis
et al., 2013). Mapped read pairs were assigned to genes with featureCounts (subread/1.4.6-p5) using ‘-t exon -g gene_id -s 20.
We used gencode version M6 (Ensembl 81) mouse genome annotation (Liao, Smyth et al., 2014). Alternative scaffolds were removed
from the analysis. To identify differentially expressed genes within different conditions, we used R/Bioconductor DeSeq2 ((Love,
Huber et al., 2014) version 1.16.1). The analysis was carried out with DeSeq2 default parameters, using raw read counts. Gene
ontology (GO) analysis for differentially expressed mRNAs was performed with topGO (version 2.28.0), gene ontology tool, using

 the ‘elim’ algorithm and nodes = 5. Significantly (adj. P value < 0.01) differentially regulated (jLFCj > 0.5) genes were used as target
and all other protein coding genes as a control. For the comparison with P60 data, we downloaded all available fastq files from ENA
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena): SRR5642466, SRR5642467, SRR5642468, SRR5642469, SRR5642470, SRR5642471, SRR5642472,
SRR5642497, SRR5642498, SRR5642499, SRR5642500, SRR5642501. All samples were processed in exact same way as our
13-week data.
Statistical Analysis
To assess statistical differences, we used Prism 6 for Windows (Graphpad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). For the Density and soma
size analysis, a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test was performed. For the electrophysiolog-
ical analysis we used students’ t test with Welch’s correction; for the Phagocytosis Analysis we used one-way-ANOVA with Turkeys
post hoc test and for the FACS data analysis we used a Students t test. Significance was defined as * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p <
0.001.; **** p < 0.0001. All error bars are given as the standard error of the mean.
