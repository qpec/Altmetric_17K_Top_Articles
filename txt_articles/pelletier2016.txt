ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND “Gender” reflects social norms for women and men, whereas “sex” defines biological characteristics.
Gender-related characteristics explain some differences in access to care for premature acute coronary syndrome (ACS);
whether they are associated with cardiovascular outcomes is unknown.
OBJECTIVES This study estimated associations between gender and sex with recurrent ACS and major adverse cardiac
events (MACE) (e.g., ACS, cardiac mortality, revascularization) over 12 months in patients with ACS.
METHODS We studied 273 women and 636 men age 18 to 55 years from GENESIS-PRAXY (GENdEr and Sex
determInantS of cardiovascular disease: from bench to beyond-Premature Acute Coronary SYndrome), a prospective
observational cohort study, who were hospitalized for ACS between January 2009 and April 2013. Gender-related
characteristics (e.g., social roles) were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire, and a composite measure of
gender was derived. Outcomes included recurrent ACS and MACE over 12 months.
RESULTS Feminine roles and personality traits were associated with higher rates of recurrent ACS and MACE compared
with masculine characteristics. This difference persisted for recurrent ACS, after multivariable adjustment (hazard ratio
from score 0 to 100: 4.50; 95% confidence interval: 1.05 to 19.27), and was a nonstatistically significant trend for MACE
(hazard ratio: 1.54; 95% confidence interval: 0.90 to 2.66). A possible explanation is increased anxiety, the only
condition that was more prevalent in patients with feminine characteristics and that rendered the association between
gender and recurrent ACS nonstatistically significant (hazard ratio: 3.56; 95% confidence interval: 0.81 to 15.61). Female
sex was not associated with outcomes post-ACS.
CONCLUSIONS Younger adults with ACS with feminine gender are at an increased risk of recurrent ACS over 12 months,
independent of female sex. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2016;67:127–35) © 2016 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.

ender reflects social norms and ex-
pectations ascribed to women and
men, in contrast to biological char-
acteristics that are captured by sex. Gender
can be referred to as the nonbiological aspects
of being male or female (e.g., social roles, per-
sonality traits) (1–4). The increased risk of
mortality in young females compared with
males after acute coronary syndrome (ACS)
(5,6) may relate to gender-related characteris-
tics (7–9). For example, hours of paid work
have increased significantly among women
in the past 20 to 30 years, which in addition
to child care responsibilities, may lead to increased
psychosocial stress (7,8,10). This stress may be exacer-
bated post-ACS and may even be a trigger of poor out-
comes (11,12).
Consistent with this idea are the results from the
Variation in Recovery: Role of Gender on Outcomes of
Young AMI Patients study, demonstrating that women
with premature ACS have a worse pre-event mental
and physical health status, and a worse quality of life
than men, regardless of their history of cardiovascular
(CV) disease (13). However, traits typically ascribed to
men, including denial of weakness and vulnerability,
are thought to undermine health promotion activities
(14). Unlike sex characteristics, gender-related char-
acteristics, such as personality traits and social roles,
can be present at different levels in both women and
men. Therefore, it is possible that there are gender-
related attitudes and roles that are important to
health behaviors apart from biological sex.
We previously observed that poorer access to care
for young women compared with men with ACS was
partly explained by gender-related attitudes and roles
traditionally ascribed to women (15). Whether atti-
tudes and social roles traditionally ascribed to women
are
associated
with
adverse
CV
outcomes
after
premature ACS is unknown. Our objectives were to
determine whether gender-related attitudes and roles
and/or sex are associated with recurrent ACS over
12 months following hospital discharge for the index
ACS and/or major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and
all-cause mortality over 12 months post-ACS, and to
explore pathways of these associations. We hypoth-
esized that gender-related attitudes and social roles
traditionally ascribed to women would be positively
associated with recurrent ACS, MACE, and all-cause
mortality at 12 months. We also hypothesized that
such patient health behaviors, clinical risk profiles,
and medical management characteristics are plau-
sible pathways for these associations.
METHODS
STUDY DESIGN. GENESIS-PRAXY (GENdEr and Sex
determInantS of cardiovascular disease: from bench to
beyond-Premature Acute Coronary SYndrome) is a
multicenter prospective follow-up of young patients
(age #55 years) with ACS. Between January 2009 and
April 2013, a total of 24 centers across Canada, 1 in the
United States, and 1 in Switzerland participated in the
recruitment of patients. Participants were followed for
a 12-month period post-ACS. A detailed description of
the design and methods of GENESIS-PRAXY has pre-
viously been published (16). The reporting of the pre-
sent analyses follows the STROBE (Strengthening the
Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology)
guidelines for observational studies (17).
ETHICS. In
Quebec,
a
multicenter
ethics
review
allowed for the McGill University Heath Centre to act
as the central review board and coordinate ethics
approval for all centers. All other centers received
ethics approval from their respective hospital ethics
review boards.

 informed consent, and admitted to the hospital with a
diagnosis of ACS. On recruitment (within 24 h of
admission), participants were asked to complete a
self-administered questionnaire (discussed in later
text) and anthropometric measurements were ob-
tained. Medical chart reviews undertaken by the
research nurse and the self-administered question-
naires were used to collect participants’ medical his-
tory, health behaviors, and index ACS characteristics;
clinical risk profile; and medical management data. At
12 months following ACS, participants’ outcome data
were reported based on medical chart reviews, and a
telephone interview was conducted by the research
nurse to complement and/or confirm data. For the
present analyses, 909 patients with baseline and
follow-up data were included.
GENDER-RELATED
FACTORS. According
to
the
Women Health Research Network of the Canadian
Institutes of Health Research, the concept of gender
includes 4 interrelated aspects that encompass the
gender construct: gender roles (e.g., child care),
gender identity (e.g., personality traits), gender re-
lationships (e.g., social support), and what is termed
“institutionalized
gender”
(e.g.,
education
level,
personal income) (1). As part of the GENESIS-PRAXY
study, several gender-related variables relevant to
cardiovascular disease (CVD) research were measured
to cover most of these 4 aspects. These variables were
initially hypothesized to be gender-related as tradi-
tionally defined (i.e., historically different in men and
women).
The
following
variables
were
therefore
measured using a self-administered questionnaire:
household’s primary earner status (assessed using the
question:
“Are
you
the
primary
earner
in
your
household?”); employment status; number of hours
of work per week; level of responsibility for caring for
children
(assessed
using
the
question:
“For
the
children that live with you, to what level are you
responsible for caring for them” on a scale from
0 to 6); level of responsibility for child discipline
(using the same question as the previous but replac-
ing “caring” by “disciplining”); number of hours per
week spent doing housework; status of household’s
primary
responsibility;
gender-related
personality
traits
assessed
using
masculinity
and
femininity
scores on the BEM Sex Role Inventory (18); stress
level at work, at home, and overall (on a scale from
1 to 10); level of confidence in stress management
abilities (assessed using the question: “How confi-
dent do you feel in managing your stress?”; partici-
pants
chose
between
“Not
confident,”
“A
little
confident,”
“Moderately
confident,”
“Very
confi-
dent”); social support-related variables, found in the
items of the ENRICHD Social Support Instrument (19);
civil status; personal income; level of education;
perceived social standing within patient’s community
and country, assessed using the MacArthur Perceived
Social Standing Scale (20); and job value and job
quality
deficit-related
variables,
assessed
using
a
previously
modified
version
of
the
Canadian
Policy Research Network–Ekos Changing Employ-
ment Relationships Survey Questionnaire (21).
GENDER-RELATED
SCORE. A detailed description
of methodology used to construct the gender index has
been published (22). Briefly, a composite measure of
the
gender-related
characteristics
was
created,
whereby
the
previously
named
variables
were
included in a principal component analysis. To deter-
mine which variables were actually gender-related in
our cohort, the 17 variables identified on the retained
components from the principal component analysis
(23,24) were included in a logistic regression using
biological sex as the dependent variable. This choice of
dependent
variable
was
made
because
to
date,
gender-related
characteristics
have
mostly
been
defined historically based on social norms and expec-
tations typically ascribed to men and women (1–4).
These norms and expectations are likely to evolve with
time, and to differ between subpopulations. We
therefore aimed to define objectively the variables that
were associated with the reality of being biologically
female or male in the GENESIS-PRAXY cohort. For this
purpose, a first logistic regression was conducted,
including sex as the dependent variable and the vari-
ables retained from the principal component analysis
as the independent variables.
The 7 variables that were independently associated
with biological sex and included in the gender-related
score (according to their own weight based on their
coefficient
estimate)
are:

 primary earner; 2) personal income; 3) number of hours
per week spent doing housework; 4) status of primary
person responsible for doing housework; 5) level of
stress at home; 6) Bem Sex Role Inventory masculinity
score; and 7) Bem Sex Role Inventory femininity
score (Online Tables 1 and 2). The gender-related
score represents the probability, between 0% and
100%, for each patient to be a “woman.” The lower the
score, the more the patient reported characteristics
traditionally ascribed to men; and vice versa, the
higher the score the more the patient reported char-
acteristics traditionally ascribed to women. Interme-
diate scores represent patients with an equivalent
level of characteristics traditionally ascribed to women
and men.
OUTCOME
MEASURES. The primary outcome was
recurrent ACS over 12 months, and the secondary
outcome
measures
included
MACE
and
all-cause
mortality over 12 months, determined using medical
chart review and complemented by a telephone inter-
view conducted by the research nurse. The first
occurring event between hospital discharge following
the index ACS and 12 months was included in the an-
alyses. MACE included recurrent ACS, cardiac mortal-
ity, and revascularization procedures (percutaneous
coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass
grafting).
POTENTIAL PATHWAYS OF THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN
SEX, GENDER-RELATED SCORE, AND OUTCOMES. Par-
ticipants’ behavior-related variables included cocaine
and
recreational
drug
use,
alcohol
consumption,
physical activity, and cigarette smoking. Clinical risk
profile-related
variables
included
anxiety
and
depression symptoms, diabetes, dyslipidemia, family
history of CVD, hypertension, obesity, previous CVD
events, having been diagnosed with an ST-segment-
elevation
myocardial
infarction
as
opposed
to
a
non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction or
unstable angina, and the GRACE (Global Registry of
Acute Coronary Events) score (a validated score used
to predict in-hospital and long-term mortality or
reinfarction). Depression and anxiety symptoms pre-
sent before the index ACS were assessed using the
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (25). Body mass
index was calculated from measured height and
weight, and obesity was defined as a body mass
index $30 kg/m2. Previous CVD events included
myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial dis-
ease, coronary artery bypass grafting, and percuta-
neous coronary intervention. The GRACE score was
calculated using chart review data and the Risk
Calculator for 6-Month Postdischarge Mortality After
Hospitalization for Acute Coronary Syndrome (26).
Medical management-related variables included delay
between the onset of chest pain and presentation to
the emergency department; number of medical visits
as outpatient at 12 months; discharge referral for
smoking cessation, diet, and cardiac rehabilitation
counseling; and discharge medication prescriptions.

 STATISTICAL ANALYSES. Descriptive statistics were
used to compare baseline characteristics among pa-
tients in the different tertiles of the gender-related
score. Tertile 1 included the third of patients (0% to
33.3%) with the highest level of gender-related char-
acteristics traditionally ascribed to men; tertile 2
included the third of patients (33.4% to 66.6%) with
an equivalent level of gender-related characteristics
traditionally ascribed to women and to men; and
tertile 3 included the third of patients (66.7% to
100%) with the highest level of gender-related char-
acteristics traditionally ascribed to women. Rates of
recurrent ACS, MACE, and all-cause mortality at
12 months were also compared among tertiles of the
gender-related score and between sexes. Continuous
variables were compared using Student t tests or
Wilcoxon
tests
as
appropriate,
and
dichotomous
variables
were
compared
using
chi-square
tests.
Tertiles of the gender-related score were used to
compare patients in descriptive analyses, whereas the
gender-related score as a continuous variable was
used in the Cox proportional hazards regression
models.
To assess the relationship of sex and gender-related
characteristics with recurrent ACS and MACE, Cox
proportional hazards models were constructed. The
multivariable models included the gender-related
score, sex, age, GRACE score, previous CVD events,
and
the
number
of
traditional
CV
risk
factors
(including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, dyslipide-
mia, cigarette smoking, and family history of CVD).
Regression analyses were not conducted for all-cause
mortality because of insufficient statistical power.
To explore potential pathways of the association
between gender-related characteristics and recurrent
ACS, only the health behaviors, clinical risk profile,
and medical management characteristics that were
associated with the gender-related score in univariate
analyses were used. These variables included anxiety;
depression; family history of CVD; smoking; dyslipi-
demia; hypertension; diabetes mellitus; and pre-
scription of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor,
antiplatelet,
and
statin
medications
at
hospital
discharge. As such, 10 Cox regression models were
conducted, where each of the previous 10 variables
were included, in rotation, in the initial multivariable
model (see previous paragraph). In these models,
changes in the effect size of the gender-related score
that were induced by the inclusion of each potential
pathway-related variable were assessed.
Statistical
analyses
were
performed
using
SAS
version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).
Statistical
tests
were
2-sided;
differences
with
p # 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS. Our study population
included 273
(30%)
women and 636 (70%)
men
(Online Figure 1), for whom the gender-related score
distribution is presented in Figure 1. In our cohort, the
mean gender-related score was 30.5 � 30.2, and
the median age was 48 years (interquartile range:
6 years). Recurrent ACS at 12 months occurred in 35
(3%) patients, and 75 (8%) and 9 (<1%) patients sus-
tained a MACE and died, respectively. Patients with
characteristics
traditionally
ascribed
to
women
(tertile 3 of the gender-related score) were more likely
to be women, unmarried, to report high levels of
anxiety and depression, to be smokers, have diabetes,

ascribed to women were also less likely to be pre-

SEX, GENDER, AND OUTCOMES. The proportions of
men and women with recurrent ACS (3% for both),
MACE (8% for both), and all-cause mortality (<1% for
both) at 12 months were similar. The risk of events
according to sex in adjusted Cox proportional hazards
regressions for recurrent ACS (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.93;
95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45 to 1.92; p ¼ 0.85)
and for MACE (HR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.41 to 1.23; p ¼ 0.22)
was inconclusive.
In contrast, when patients were categorized ac-
cording to tertiles of the gender-related score, the
rate of recurrent ACS in patients with characteristics
traditionally ascribed to women was 5% compared
with 2% in the other 2 groups. Results of the multi-
variable Cox regression analysis adjusted for sex, age,
ethnicity, previous CV events, the GRACE score, and
the number of traditional CV risk factors further
supported the univariate results: patients with char-
acteristics traditionally ascribed to women were more
likely to experience a recurrent ACS than patients
with characteristics traditionally ascribed to men
(HR: 4.50; 95% CI: 1.05 to 19.27; p ¼ 0.04) (Figure 2A,
Table 2).
The rate of MACE was 9% in patients in tertiles
3 and 2 of the gender-related score, whereas it was 6%
in patients from tertile 1. Results of the multivariable

than
patients
with
characteristics
traditionally ascribed to men (HR: 1.54; 95% CI: 0.90

rate was 1% in patients in tertile 3 and in tertile 2 of
the gender-related score, whereas it was 0% in
patients in tertile 1. No multivariable analyses were
conducted because of insufficient statistical power.
POTENTIAL
PATHWAYS
OF
ASSOCIATION
BETWEEN
GENDER-RELATED CHARACTERISTICS AND OUTCOMES.
Results of our exploratory analyses indicated that
higher levels of anxiety decreased the effect size of
the gender-related score by over 10%, and rendered
its association with recurrent ACS nonstatistically
significant. No other variables had a notable decre-
mental effect on the effect size (range of decrease for
other plausible pathways, 0% to 3%). This result in-
dicates that elevated anxiety may be a pathway

 through which personality traits and social roles
traditionally ascribed to women increase the risk of
recurrent ACS (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
This study suggests that personality traits and social
roles traditionally ascribed to women are associated
with adverse CV outcomes in young patients with
ACS. Specifically, event rates at 12 months were
higher in patients with personality traits and roles
traditionally ascribed to women compared with pa-
tients with personality traits and roles traditionally
ascribed to men. In contrast, event rates did not differ
between sexes (Central Illustration). This study also
indicates that reported increased anxiety may repre-
sent a means by which gender-related characteristics
are associated with adverse CV outcomes.
The
reason
why
characteristics
traditionally
ascribed to women increase the risk of adverse CV
outcomes after a premature ACS independent of bio-
logical sex is likely multifactorial. One possibility is
that in younger adults, personality traits, family, and
institutional roles influence CV health more sub-
stantively than biological/anatomic sex characteris-
tics.
An
association
between
gender
roles
and
coronary heart disease incidence has previously been
reported in middle-aged women (27). In this study,
Japanese women living with both a spouse and chil-
dren had a 2.1-fold higher risk of coronary heart dis-
ease compared with women living with a spouse but
no children. It is noteworthy that the expectations
with regards to family roles may differ between Jap-
anese and American culture. Nonetheless, results of
this
Japanese
study
suggest
that
an
increased
children-related burden may
adversely affect CV

 health. Previous studies have further shown that be-
ing married is associated with a better prognosis after
myocardial
infarction
in
men,
whereas
married
middle-aged women have a greater fatality risk than
unmarried women (28,29). The discrepancy between
married women and men is thought to be partly
explained by men enjoying social support and control
provided by the wife, because women have the ten-
dency to take greater responsibility over organizing
health care and providing care (30). However, such
feminine gender roles (i.e., the organizing and care
tendency
toward
the
husband)
may
represent
a
burden and a daily stress for married cardiac women.
Moreover, in the last decades, there has been a
continuous increase in women’s economic participa-
tion and opportunities, and educational attainment
(7,9). Nevertheless, in today’s high-performance and
consumer-focused
era,
most
women
continue
to
retain
some
of
the
traditional
“feminine”
re-
sponsibilities (e.g., child care) even when employed
outside the home. Similarly, men whose wives work
outside the home are also likely to be faced with
increased household and childcare responsibilities
(7). Middle-aged men and women also often face
divorce and have to deal with single parenting, debts,
and/or lack of resources (31). These gender-related
characteristics are present at different levels in both
women and men, and in the present study, they
adversely affect health processes, independent of
biological sex.
In our cohort, characteristics traditionally ascribed
to females seemed to adversely affect health out-
comes potentially through increased levels of anxi-
ety.
Previous
studies
have
shown
that
anxiety
increases the risk of CVD via excessive activation of
the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
axis
and
the
sympathetic nervous system, and via poor health
behaviors (32). There are likely multiple and various
reasons to explain the presence of increased anxiety
in men and women with characteristics traditionally
ascribed to women in our sample. For example,
marital strain as described previously, and financial
difficulties and/or the need to manage housework,
child care, and work may represent a daily burden
and chronic anxiety may result.
STUDY
LIMITATIONS. This
study
contains
some
methodological limitations. First, the low mortality
rate at 12 months led to low statistical power. This
limitation may explain why we did not observe
significant associations between sex and adverse
CV
outcomes,
which
is
in
contrast
to
previous
studies with higher ACS rates and comparable pro-
portions of men and women (1). Second, given the
limited numbers of recurrent ACS, the interpretation
of the stepwise analyses is limited. Insufficient sta-
tistical power may be a reason why anxiety was
not associated with the outcome in the multivari-
able model. As such, we hypothesized that increased
anxiety may represent a pathway for the association
between gender-related characteristics and recurrent
ACS, but larger studies are needed to replicate this
finding. Third, a small proportion of our patients
were
recruited
in
the
United
States
and
in
Switzerland. Despite the fact that gender-related
characteristics are culturally sensitive, only 19 (2%)
and
42
(5%)
patients
were
recruited
in
the
United States and in Switzerland, respectively, and
thus
it
is
unlikely
that
our
results
have
been
affected. We still cannot exclude possible cultural
differences within Canada. Fourth, participants who
did not complete follow-up were more likely to
be diabetic, smokers, depressed, obese, and nonwhite
than those with follow-up data who were included
in the analyses. Three of these variables (diabetes,
depression,
and
cigarette
smoking)
were
associ-
ated with gender-related characteristics traditionally
attributed to women in our study. As such, the in-
clusion of patients with missing follow-up data would
have likely increased the outcomes risk in the group
of patients with more feminine gender-related score
and would have likely strengthened even more the
association we observed between the gender-related
score and the risk of recurrent ACS. Finally, there
exists no gold standard for a measure of gender
and as such, our gender-related score is internally
derived without external validation.
CONCLUSIONS
Overall, our study allowed the assessment of the role
of variables that are traditionally ascribed to each sex
in society, and may shed light on unexplained sex
differences in ACS. Specifically, this study shows that
personality traits, such as being shy and sensitive to
the needs of others, and social roles, such as being
responsible for housework, which are traditionally
ascribed to women, increase the risk of adverse CV
outcomes in young patients with ACS. Gender-related
characteristics might impact adverse CV outcomes
through increased anxiety.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Gender-
related characteristics like personality traits and social
roles (psychosocial sex) may be as important as biological
sex in predicting adverse cardiovascular outcomes in
young patients with acute coronary syndromes. Both
women and men with personality traits and social roles
traditionally attributed to women are at increased risk of
subsequent adverse events.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Further studies in larger
cohorts are needed to confirm these findings and explore
the mechanisms responsible for the associations between
feminine gender scores and adverse cardiovascular
outcomes.
