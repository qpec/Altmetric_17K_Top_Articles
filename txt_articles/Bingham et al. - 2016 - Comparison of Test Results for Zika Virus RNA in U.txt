On May 10, 2016, this report was posted as an MMWR Early 
Release on the MMWR website (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr).
In May 2015, Zika virus was reported to be circulating in 
Brazil. This was the first identified introduction of the virus in the 
Region of the Americas. Since that time, Zika virus has rapidly 
spread throughout the region. As of April 20, 2016, the Florida 
Department of Health Bureau of Public Health Laboratories 
(BPHL) has tested specimens from 913 persons who met state 
criteria for Zika virus testing. Among these 913 persons, 91 met 
confirmed or probable Zika virus disease case criteria and all cases 
were travel-associated (1). On the basis of previous small case stud-
ies reporting real time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reac-
tion (RT-PCR) detection of Zika virus RNA in urine, saliva, and 
semen (2–6), the Florida Department of Health collected multiple 
specimen types from persons with suspected Zika virus disease. 
Test results were evaluated by specimen type and number of days 
after symptom onset to determine the most sensitive and efficient 
testing algorithm for acute Zika virus disease. Urine specimens 
were collected from 70 patients with suspected Zika virus disease 
from zero to 20 days after symptom onset. Of these, 65 (93%) 
tested positive for Zika virus RNA by RT-PCR. Results for 95% 
(52/55) of urine specimens collected from persons within 5 days 
of symptom onset tested positive by RT-PCR; only 56% (31/55) 
of serum specimens collected on the same date tested positive by 
RT-PCR. Results for 82% (9/11) of urine specimens collected 
>5 days after symptom onset tested positive by RT-PCR; none 
of the RT-PCR tests for serum specimens were positive. No cases 
had results that were exclusively positive by RT-PCR testing of 
saliva. BPHL testing results suggest urine might be the preferred 
specimen type to identify acute Zika virus disease.
Criteria for Zika virus testing included persons who expe-
rienced two or more of the following symptoms: rash, fever, 
arthralgia or conjunctivitis during or within 2 weeks of return 
from an area with Zika virus activity, or who had an epidemio-
logic link to a Zika virus–infected traveler (sexual partner, house-
hold member, etc.). RT-PCR was routinely performed on urine, 
serum, or saliva specimens collected within 21 days of symptom 
onset. Clinicians were informed that only the serum RT-PCR 
and antibody tests were to be used for diagnostic purposes. Urine 
and saliva RT-PCR tests were only used for surveillance purposes. 
Serologic testing was performed on all serum specimens included 
in this analysis. The probable case definition criteria for Zika 
virus disease, based on serology, required Zika virus–specific 
IgM antibodies and no dengue virus–specific IgM antibodies 
detected in serum or cerebrospinal fluid.
Zika virus RT-PCR was performed at BPHL using a laboratory-
developed test based on a previously published protocol using 
two RT-PCR targets (7) (this is not the CDC Trioplex rRT-
PCR assay authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug 
Administration (8)). Specimens were tested in a primary assay, in 
duplicate in the same run, with a primer and probe set that detects 
all known genotypes of Zika virus, ZIKV 1086/1162c/1107FAM 
(later renamed ZIKV 1087/1163c/1108FAM). If detected in 
at least one of the duplicates, the same extract was tested with a 
secondary assay, in duplicate in the same run, with a primer and 
probe set that detects the Asian genotype currently circulating 
in the Western Hemisphere, ZIKV 4481/4552c/4507cFAM 
(unpublished Zika real time RT-PCR protocol, RS Lanciotti, 
Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, CDC, Fort Collins, 
Colorado, updated January 14, 2016).
Specimens reported as positive had cycle threshold (Ct) values 
≤38 for at least one of the replicates in both the primary and 
secondary RT-PCR assays. Specimens reported as equivocal 
had a Ct value ≤38 in the primary assay, but not the second-
ary assay. For the purpose of this analysis, equivocal specimens 
were considered as negative. Specimens reported as negative had 
Ct values >38 in the primary assay and were not tested further. 
Zika virus and dengue virus IgM antibody testing was performed 
at BPHL using a laboratory-developed IgM antibody capture 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA) based on 
a CDC flavivirus MAC-ELISA protocol (9). In March 2016, 
BPHL transitioned to the Food and Drug Administration’s 
Emergency Use Authorization Zika MAC-ELISA developed 
by CDC (8). Zika virus antigen and positive control material 
were provided by CDC. A positive/negative (P/N) ratio was 
calculated from results of the MAC-ELISA for each specimen 
tested and was interpreted as the following: P/N ratios <2 were 
reported as negative, P/N ratios 2–<3 were reported as equivo-
cal, and P/N ratios ≥3 were reported as presumptive positive, 
as defined in the emergency use authorization.

FIGURE. Results of RT-PCR testing for Zika virus RNA in urine specimens of 70 persons with travel-associated Zika virus disease, by number of 
days after onset of symptoms — Florida, 2016*
Abbreviation: RT-PCR = reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
* Four persons included in figure did not contribute to the 66 persons with urine and serum specimens collected on the same day; each of these four persons had 
Zika virus RNA detected in their urine specimens, which were collected on days 3, 7, 12, and 13, respectively.
As of April 20, 2016, 91 cases of travel-associated Zika virus 
disease had been reported in Florida. Urine specimens were 
collected from a total of 70 persons with Zika virus disease, 
and in 65 (93%) of the cases, the urine specimen was positive 
by RT-PCR (Figure). The five specimens that were negative 
by RT-PCR testing were collected on days 2, 5, 5, 7, and 14 
after symptom onset. Viral RNA was detectable in urine as 
early as the 1st day of symptoms and as late as 20 days after 
onset of symptoms. Ten of 12 urine specimens (83%) collected 
7–20 days after symptom onset were positive. Among 62 of 
the 65 cases with positive urine specimens by RT-PCR testing, 
both primer and probe sets were positive in duplicate reactions. 
For two of the three remaining cases, a saliva specimen also 
tested positive by RT-PCR.
In 66 cases, persons had urine and serum specimens col-
lected on the same day. The majority of these persons were 
female (64%), white (77%), and Hispanic (71%), with a 
median age of 46 years (range = 23–76 years). In two cases, 
female patients were pregnant. Approximately twice as many 
persons had RT-PCR positive test results for Zika virus RNA in 
urine specimens compared with serum specimens, 61 persons 
(92%) versus 31 (47%), respectively. One person had positive 
test results in serum alone (2 days after symptom onset) and 
31 persons had positive test results only for urine specimens.
Among the 55 persons with urine and serum specimens 
collected within the first 5 days of symptom onset, 52 (95%) 
had urine specimens that tested positive for Zika virus RNA 
by RT-PCR testing and 31 (56%) had serum specimens that 
tested positive (Table 1). Forty percent (22/55) of the serum 
specimens had detectable Zika virus IgM antibodies, including 
two specimens collected 1 day after symptom onset. Among the 
11 cases with specimens collected >5 days after symptom onset, 
nine persons (82%) had urine specimens that tested positive by 
RT-PCR; none had serum specimens that tested positive (Table 1).
Three specimen types collected on the same day were available 
for 53 of the 66 cases and were tested by RT-PCR: 92% of urine 
specimens, 81% of saliva specimens, and 51% of serum speci-
mens tested positive. Viral RNA was detected in saliva as early 
as 1 day and as late as 20 days after symptom onset (Table 2). 
All cases with saliva specimens that tested positive for Zika virus 
RNA by RT-PCR testing also had at least one other specimen 
type that tested positive by RT-PCR testing.
Of the 66 serum specimens that also had paired urine speci-
mens, five (8%) tested positive for both Zika virus RNA and IgM 
antibody (the five specimens were collected 1, 2, 3, 5, and 5 days 
after symptom onset) (Table 1). Among the 31 cases in which 
urine specimens tested positive by RT-PCR, but serum specimens 
tested negative, Zika virus IgM antibody was detected in serum

in 23 (74%). Of the remaining eight cases in which neither IgM 
antibodies nor viral RNA were detected in serum, Zika virus RNA 
was detected in saliva as well as urine in five cases (the five cases 
had all three specimens collected on days 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9 after 
symptom onset, respectively), and in three cases (serum and urine 
specimens collected days 0, 2, and 3, respectively) saliva specimens 
were not collected for testing. Overall, Zika virus IgM antibodies 
were detectable in the serum specimens from 48% of the 66 cases. 
Four of the 66 cases had serum and urine specimens that tested 
negative by RT-PCR testing, but positive (serum specimens only) 
by IgM antibody testing (specimens collected 5, 5, 7, and 14 days 
after symptom onset, respectively).
Discussion
Results of testing conducted at BPHL suggest that urine might 
be the preferred specimen type to identify acute Zika virus disease. 
Rates of detection from urine were higher than from serum, even 
during the first few days after symptom onset and continuing after 
day five, when no serum specimens tested in this evaluation had 
detectable RNA. Assays used for diagnostic purposes need to be 
validated for the specific specimen type being tested. The ability 
to confirm that a recent illness is caused by Zika virus and not 
another flavivirus by detection of Zika virus RNA in a clinical 
specimen is important, given the limitations in interpretation of 
results from serology testing in persons who have had previous 
flavivirus infection or vaccination. Among pregnant women, 
this ability to confirm Zika virus is important because close 
monitoring during pregnancy is recommended for women 
with confirmed Zika virus disease. The ease of collection of 
urine specimens is an additional advantage. This report also 
demonstrates that saliva specimens (another specimen that is 
easily obtained) can also yield a higher rate of RNA detection 
than serum even during the first 5 days; the detection rate in 
saliva also approaches the detection rate in urine. However, no 
cases were identified through saliva testing alone.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. 
First, eight patients from the group with serum and urine tested by 
RT-PCR who had RNA detected in their urine specimen but not 
in their serum specimen did not have Zika virus IgM antibodies 
detected in their serum to provide an independent confirmation 
of Zika virus infection. However, five of these eight patients had 
a saliva specimen available, and all five had viral RNA detected in

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Limited data suggest Zika virus is excreted in multiple body 
fluids, including urine and saliva. Urine and saliva might be 
appropriate specimens for evaluating Zika virus disease.
What is added by this report?
A comparison of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) test results for urine and serum specimens from 
66 persons with Zika virus disease with both specimens collected 
on the same date indicated that approximately twice as many 
urine specimens (61) than serum specimens (31) tested positive. 
No results from RT-PCR testing of serum specimens were positive 
>5 days after symptom onset; results from testing nine of 
11 urine specimens were positive. A further comparison of 
53 persons with Zika virus disease with urine, saliva, and serum 
specimens collected on the same date found positive results from 
testing in 49 (92%) urine specimens, 43 (81%) saliva specimens, 
and 27 (51%) serum specimens.
What are the implications for public health practice?
These results suggest urine might be a useful specimen for 
identifying acute Zika virus disease.

saliva. The lack of IgM antibodies in some of the cases might be 
explained by the early timing of the serum collection; Zika virus 
IgM antibody might be detectable in serum specimens collected 
as early as 4–5 days after symptom onset, and is usually present 
by 7 days after symptom onset (7). However, convalescent serum 
specimens were not obtained to help confirm Zika virus disease 
by serology. Second, only five urine specimens came from patients 
>7 days after symptom onset; therefore the RNA detection rate 
in urine specimens from this period is not well characterized. 
However, the limited data available demonstrate that testing of 
some specimens can have positive results as far out as 20 days. 
Third, date of symptom onset can be difficult to ascertain, 
particularly in symptoms with mild symptoms. Therefore, 
the absolute rate of RNA detection for a particular day after 
symptom onset might be imprecise, but the relative detection 
rate across specimen types should not be impacted by this limi-
tation. Finally, real-time RT-PCR results should be carefully 
interpreted to account for the possibility of false-negative and 
false-positive results, particularly at the lower limits of detec-
tion of the assay, when reproducibility is low and results are 
not confirmed with both primer/probe sets in replicate tests.
