Abstract
Background: In line with calls for action from international health organizations, Chile implemented in June 2016 a set
of regulations to tackle the obesity epidemic. The new regulation includes the mandatory use of front-of-package
warning labels on packaged foods/beverages high in energy, sugars, saturated fats and sodium. Additionally, such
foods cannot be sold nor offered in daycares/schools and cannot be promoted to children under 14yo. The law is
targeted to children; thus, this study examined mothers’ understanding, perceptions, and behaviors associated with the
regulation one year after its implementation, using a qualitative approach.
Methods: Nine focus groups of mothers (7–10 people each) of children (2-14yo) were conducted in July 2017 in
Santiago-Chile. They were stratified by socioeconomic status (SES) and children’s age. Macrocodes were developed by
three researchers, combining an iterative process of deductive and inductive thematic analyses. Quotations
representing each category were selected.
Results: Mothers understood the new regulation as a policy to fight child obesity and were aware that products
with more labels were less healthy than products with fewer labels. Attention and use of labels in the buying
decision-making process ranged from participants who did not pay attention to others who relied on them as a
quick shortcut (mostly from middle and upper-SES); many mothers indicated changing their purchase habits only
when buying new products. Mothers declared that young children accepted school environment changes while
teens/preteens resisted them more. Many mothers agreed that schools have become key promoters of food
behavioral change. Mothers were less aware about the food marketing regulations. Mothers declared that they
perceived that the regulation was changing the perceptions, attitudes and behaviors toward healthier
eating patterns.
Conclusion: After the first year of implementation, the regulation was well known by mothers of diverse SES and
different children ages. The degree of use of warning labels was heterogeneous among participants, but most of them
agreed that their children, particularly the youngest have positive attitudes toward the regulation and have become
promoters of change in their families. Many mothers also expressed that they perceived an important shift toward
healthier eating, which may lead to a change in eating social norms. This information contributes to better understand
how regulatory actions may influence people’s consumer behaviors.

 Background
Obesity has become a worldwide epidemic and public
health authorities have urged countries to implement pol-
icies that address the increasing obesity and related
non-communicable diseases, particularly among children
[1, 2]. As a result, several strategies have been discussed
and attempted, including mandatory easy-to-understand
nutrition labels (e.g., Ecuador has a traffic light system)
[3], marketing restrictions of unhealthy foods in child-
targeted media (e.g., United Kingdom) [4], taxes on
sugar-sweetened beverages
and non-essential energy-
dense foods (e.g., Mexico) [5] and policies that target
school-food environments (e.g., Canada and Brazil) [6].
In Chile, obesity and diet-related diseases reach epi-
demic proportions. One out of four school children
(24.6% 6-7yo old) and a third of adult population
(31.2% in >15yo) present obesity [7, 8], while high body
mass index and diet-related risk factors are the main
cause of premature death and disability in the country.
As a response, a comprehensive food regulation was in-
troduced in June 2016 which combined several initia-
tives
(front-of
package
(FOP)
labeling,
marketing
restrictions, and school regulations) to promote health-
ier food environments through a multifactorial, struc-
tural approach [9, 10]; children were the intended
primary beneficiaries.
Given the paucity of policy interventions, there is scarce
evidence on their impact, especially when regulations are
installed in combination such as in the case of the Chilean
Law of Food Labeling and Advertising. A key component
of the success of the policies is based on the perceptions
that people may have of the different actions and how reg-
ulations influence their attitudes and behaviors. In Chile,
mothers are a key stakeholder of the new policy because
they are primarily responsible for food purchase decisions
and serve as gatekeepers for food availability in the house-
hold [11], thus, understanding their perceptions is particu-
larly relevant. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to
examine mothers’ understanding, perceptions, and behav-
iors associated with Chile’s food regulation using a qualita-
tive approach. We explored how each of the three key
areas of the law—FOP labeling, school regulations, and
marketing restrictions—are related to family eating and
food purchase decisions and how they interact with each
other. It is especially important to understand whether the
implementation of a package of measures improves results
observed
with single actions
[12]. Thus,
our
find-
ings should inform future regulations in Chile as well as in
other countries.
Methods
Study design
We conducted qualitative focus groups in Chile’s cap-
ital city, Santiago, where over one third of the country’s
population live. Nine focus groups of 7–10 mothers of
children aged 2–14 were conducted in July 2017, one
year after the introduction of the regulation. Focus
groups
allowed
a
deeper
comprehension
on
how
mothers understood, received and experienced the new
policy as well as observing how they discussed about it.
In focus groups, participants can interact, explore each
other’s arguments and express topics that they deem
important [13, 14]. The 9 focus groups allowed a 3 × 3
stratification according to socioeconomic status (lower,
middle, upper) and children’s age (2–6; 7–10; 11–14).
This stratification was based on previous research [15]
and intended to obtain a diversity of views and experi-
ences based on mothers’ SES background and their
children’s development stage.
Chilean law of food labeling and advertising
Details of the law have been described elsewhere [10,
11]. Briefly, the Chilean law of food labeling and adver-
tising applies multiple marketing and sales restrictions
to foods and beverages with high levels of energy, satu-
rated
fats,
sodium
and
sugars
(HEFSS
hereafter).
Thresholds to be considered high in critical nutrients
have become more restrictive according to three phases
of implementation of the law (see the thresholds for
June 2016, June 2018 and June 2019 in Table 1).
Due to the law implementation, HEFSS products
must include a front-of-package label (FOP, a black
stop sign) that announces the high critical nutrient, for
example, “high in sugar” or “high in sodium,” such that
a product could have four labels if all four critical nutri-
ents exceed the regulation’s thresholds. In addition,
HEFSS products cannot be sold, distributed or pro-
moted in daycares or schools, nor can these products
be advertised in child-targeted media on the radio, tele-
vision, cinema and internet. HEFSS marketing also can-
not include strategies that appeal to youth up to 14yo,
such as the presence of children, characters, celebrities,
athletes, toys, or school references [10].

 Participants and recruitment
Mothers (n = 84) were recruited from 20 out of 35 dis-
tricts of Santiago. A focus group recruiting company
was hired to get access to mothers from different
neighborhoods and socioeconomic profiles, to make
sure they did not know each other. The filter question-
naire included participants’ age, marital status, district
where they live, children’s age, type of daycare or
school (public, semi-private, private), occupation, level
of education, education and occupation of head of
household, family income and possession of material
goods (i.e., car, house, current bank account, house-
keeping
service,
internet
connection
and
type
of
healthcare system). People who had worked in the
marketing and food-related industries (e.g., supermar-
kets, restaurants, retail companies) were excluded from
the study.
Socioeconomic status (SES) was identified by the follow-
ing variables: family income, possession of material goods,
type of school attended by their children and district of
residence. Lower-SES included mothers with monthly
family incomes of US$750 or less, who did not own a
house or a car and did not have household internet con-
nection and were registered in the public healthcare sys-
tem. Their children attended public schools and lived in
districts with a high proportion of poverty, according to
the Chilean National Socioeconomic Characterization
Survey (CASEN) (e.g., El Bosque, Conchalí, Puente Alto,
Cerro Navia) [16]. Middle-SES included mothers with
monthly family income that ranged US$750-US$3800,
owned a car (but not necessarily a house) and had
household internet connection. They were registered
in
the
private
healthcare
system,
their
children
attended either semi-private or private schools and
lived in districts with lower levels of poverty (e.g.,
Ñuñoa, Peñalolén, Huechuraba, and Santiago Centro).
Finally, upper-SES included mothers with monthly
family incomes over US$3800, owned at least one car,
a house and had household Internet connection. They
were registered in the private healthcare system, their
children attended private schools and lived in districts
with very low proportion of poverty (e.g., La Reina,
Las Condes) (see Table 2 for a description of the so-
cioeconomic profiles of mothers who participated in
the study).
Procedures
Focus groups questions guiding the discussion were
elaborated by an interdisciplinary group of scholars
from epidemiology, nutrition, public health and com-
munication who have been evaluating the regulation
from a variety of angles. Thirty questions covered the
evolution of eating routines, buying decision-making
processes, opinions and behaviors regarding FOP labels,
school regulation and marketing strategies; we also
asked
participants
about
some
of
the
marketing

 techniques that food industry has used to counteract
the message of the labels. Focus groups were led by
one of the investigators and two research assistants in
the communication department of Diego Portales Uni-
versity in Chile and lasted 90 min on average. Partici-
pants' names were changed to ensure anonymity. IRB
approval was obtained from INTA’s and University
Diego Portales' Ethics Committee. Signed informed
consents for each of the participants were obtained by
the investigators facilitating the focus groups before
starting the sessions.
Transcription and analysis
Sessions were audio taped and then transcribed by two
trained research assistants. By relying on a hybrid process
that combined deductive and inductive thematic analyses
[17], the first author, corresponding author and a trained
research assistant developed macrocodes based on the re-
search questions that tackled the different aspects of the
law and previous literature [18]. Then, transcripts were
subjected to an iterative process of careful reading and re-
reading [19] conducted by these three people independ-
ently, who revised the original template and developed a
coding scheme based on the previous questions of the
focus groups (i.e. deductive process) and the new themes
that were generated from the transcripts (i.e. inductive
process). Then, all the transcripts were assigned specific
codes according to the main categories and subcategories
and the quotations that best represented each category
were selected, translated into English and revised by the
team of three bilingual researchers.
Results
The report of results is organized according to three
key areas covered by the new law: FOP labeling, regula-
tion in schools and marketing strategies. Within each
section, we described the different themes that were
generated based on the analyses. Also, because the ana-
lyses revealed that the different aspects of the regula-
tion are closely interrelated and interact with each
other, we included a fourth section that analyzes the
cross-cutting effects.
FOP labeling
Results showed that in all the focus groups mothers
understood that the new regulation, including FOP la-
bels, was a policy to fight the high levels of child obes-
ity and related diseases in the country. For example,
one mother of a 5yo girl (Gina) gave the following re-
sponse: “Because of the high levels of obesity, hyperten-
sion and diabetes” and “Some kids are very chubby. So
(…) you can think that the alimentary habits need to
be changed.”
Awareness and uncovering
Everybody were aware that a product can be labeled with
four signs maximum and that products with more labels
are less healthy than products with fewer labels. Many
mothers said they use the number of labels as guidance.
For instance, Soledad, secretary at an educational institu-
tion with a 6yo boy, explained:
“The good thing is that my son likes cookies a lot, so
I tell him (in the supermarket) ‘look for the cookies
that have the fewest labels and that one you can
take. So, it is useful for me that he, by himself,
realizes what is bad. He tells me,‘Mom, look, this
one has three (labels)” No, too much. Look for
another that has one.
The appearance of warning labels also “uncovered”
many products, according to the mothers. Some admit-
ted that they were surprised, saying that their “eyes
were opened.” For instance, Dafne, homemaker (with
13yo and 23yo sons), who participated in the lower-SES
group asserted: “I didn’t think these things were so bad.”
Some said that they felt “cheated” by products they
considered healthy such as breakfast cereals, cereal bars
or yogurts. For instance, Constanza, homemaker from
lower-SES (13yo son and 8yo daughter) explained that
she used to buy a chocolate breakfast cereal but now
she is changing it for an oat breakfast cereal. She also
said: “(…) regarding the cereal bars, I used to believe
they were healthy and used to give them as a snack (to
the kids), but they have too much sugar.” Disappoint-
ment was even stronger in brands that were advertised
and named as healthy and nutritious. For example,
Dominique (5yo boy), used to buy muffins of the brand
Nutrabien (Goodnutrition) as school snack:
I associated that the brand Nutrabien (Goodnutrition)
was very healthy, until those black labels came out. I
realized that it had high levels of everything, and I felt
very cheated (…) I really had no idea, I never paid
attention. Now, I do pay attention.
Despite that mothers were aware that the more labels,
the unhealthier the product, they indicated that they do
not understand well the principles that define when the
packages have to carry labels. Regardless of partici-
pants’ SES, they said that they would like to have more
information about the process of assigning labels to a
product. For instance, one participant said: “I would
really like (…) more information (about FOP labels), be-
cause I’m not an expert in this topic” (Anita, children
4yo and 10yo). “It could be clarified (…) how much per-
centage of an ingredient a certain product should have”
(Gina, daughter of 5yo).

 Gradational attention and use of labels
Analyses also revealed that there are gradations of atten-
tion and use of FOP labels in the buying decision-making
process. While some mothers admitted they do not pay at-
tention to them (e.g., “I practically don’t see them,” “I don’t
pay attention,” “I don’t use them”), others explained that
they rely on them as a quick shortcut: “I don’t read them
like this (very closely) but when I see too many, I don’t buy
it.” (Delia, cashier, children of 6 m, 4yo and 13yo). Many
said that they changed their purchase habits only when
they buy new products. For instance, Patricia, dance in-
structor (mother of two children, 5yo and 8yo), explained:
“I tend to buy the same things as always. I only pay atten-
tion to these labels when I want to try out something new,
I want to make sure that it doesn’t have a lot of sodium
and sugar.”
Other mothers, however, particularly from middle and
upper-SES, asserted that they pay very close attention.
Dominique (business administrator, 5yo son) said: “The
thing of labeling food products, I tell you… it did change
my shopping decisions. Before, I used to buy thinking that
everything was good and I didn’t read the nutritional
table, now I do look at it.” These changes were, many
times, led by children. Mabel, homemaker from upper-
SES (19yo daughter and 13yo son), explained:
To be honest, I started to notice them [the labels] not
by myself, but because my children, or their friends
(…) now that this thing of the black labels started,
start to read and be like ‘Mom, the yogurt has zero
fats’ or… I don’t know how this is called… fat free.
Despite the awareness and use of black labels, partici-
pants warned about the potential negative effects that
might cause the omnipresence of the labels because
many packages carry them. In a middle-SES focus
group, the following dialogue was sustained: “Some-
times [these labeling measures] I feel they’re invasive.
The information can cause the reverse effect.” (Claire,
midwife,
4yo
daughter).
“It
(can
cause)
rejection.”
(Daisy, 6yo boy). “Right, it’s rejection because in the end
everything has labels…” (Claire). “It’s like that you don’t
see the labels anymore.” (Daisy).
Regulation in schools
HEFSS foods cannot be sold at schools. Therefore, the
on-site school kiosks –usually used to buy food during
school breaks- have had to adjust what food they offer.
Consuelo (veterinarian, two children of 4yo and 5yo)
remembered that in her old school “everything was
fried. Now you go and it’s full of fruits, veggies, natural
stuff.” The analyses revealed that these changes have
not been questioned by young children, however, they
have been more challenging for teens and preteens,
many of whom do not want to buy food at school. For
instance, Maribel, a mother of a 13yo child, asserted:
“My son didn’t agree when the school started to put
restrictions on the things that couldn’t be sold, because
he used to take cash to the school and would buy a
hot dog and a soda (…) When they took everything
away from the kiosk, [I’d ask] ‘what did you buy?’
‘Nothing because everything was boring.’ ‘What was
boring?’ ‘There were fajitas with veggies but there
wasn’t ketchup and mayonnaise to put it in the fajita.
They also sold fruits, and I didn’t like that.’ ‘So, what
did you buy?’ ‘Nothing.’ So, he prefers to bring the
money back home.”
Other participants indicated that their children de-
cided to change their diet. Paula (artisan) explained that
her 13yo son “used to buy fries with the money he took
to the school. Then, I didn’t give him money anymore be-
cause he is tall and overweight, so he wouldn’t be able to
buy fries and stuff like that. After that, the woman that
sells food at my kid’s school started to sell fruits, sand-
wiches with avocado, with ham or cheese. Then my son
started to take money back again, and he buys for him-
self a juice and a sandwich.”
School as an agent of change
Despite the fact that the regulation at schools only estab-
lished restrictions in terms of promotion and selling, in
every focus group, mothers said that the school has be-
come a key promoter of food behavioral change by
explaining what is healthy or unhealthy. According to the
mothers, teachers use the FOP labels as a shortcut by say-
ing, for example, “don’t bring food with more than two la-
bels.” Furthermore, they described that in elementary
schools, it is no longer allowed to buy HEFSS food, and
teachers are the ones that suggest what snacks are healthy
enough to be acceptable. Some schools even organized a
list with a day-by-day suggested healthy morning snack.
Some of these participants, particularly from lower-
SES, explained that before this law, schools allowed and
promoted special events (such as the last day of class)
that involved the whole class in sharing snacks that were
usually unhealthy (e.g., chips, sugar-sweetened bever-
ages). But, within this past year, these gatherings and
special events have no longer included unhealthy food
because teachers do not allow these products in the
classroom anymore. Instead, “these gatherings with food
for special events are now healthier at school.” (Patricia,
lower-SES focus group). “They have fruit and sand-
wiches” (Vania), “olives” (Patricia), “carrot sticks” (Vania).
Some participants agreed with this new policy, but
others found it “boring” because the kids “don’t eat, they
leave everything on the table” (Solange, 13yo daughter).
Correa et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity           (2019) 16:21 
Page 5 of 10
 Another mother explained that the family has been
adjusting to the changes. For the shared-snack days and
other parties hosted at the school, “we may not bring
fruit kebobs because they may not eat them, but we
bring yogurt and [breakfast] cereal (…) or ham and
cheese sandwiches.”
Parents’ resistance vs. young children’s commitment
In lower-SES groups, a few participants expressed uneasi-
ness about the new school food environment and rejected
these changes. Some moms complained that their freedom
to choose products for their children was diminished,
some saying that they had to stop giving their children
“junk food” for school snacks because those snacks could
be taken away from their children at school. One partici-
pant acknowledged that now they were surrounded by a
healthier environment, so she asserted that sometimes it
is good to spoil children with “junk food”: “Playground:
healthy, home: healthy, TV: healthy. Sometimes it is good
to spoil them. It is not like it’s going to happen every day. If
almost everyone eats [junk food], why should we forbid
them?” (Vania, mother of a 5yo girl).
Despite the rejection of some mothers from lower-SES,
their own children seem to be more committed with this
law, especially children under 8yo, who started to ask for
healthier snacks, replace juice and soda with water and
consume more vegetables. This pattern was witnessed in
every focus group, but it was more relevant and pervasive
in the middle- and lower-SES. For instance, Gina (mother
of a 5yo daughter) explained:
Because of this new law, my daughter has been taught a
lot about these black logos. ‘No mom, you can’t buy me
that, my teacher won’t accept it because it has those
labels’. And she requests me salads, she doesn’t accept
snacks that have black labels. And because I have
adapted to that as well, when we go grocery shopping, I
see a product and I’m like… ‘No, she won’t accept that if
I buy it to her’
, so I have to search for a product that at
most contains 2 logos. But three, there is no way.
Marketing strategies
Unnoticed strategies
Although mothers were aware that the law involved the
FOP labels and restrictions in schools of unhealthy prod-
ucts, they were less aware that the law also regulated
food marketing and advertising in the media or on prod-
uct packages. Only a few participants had noticed that
some of the front packaging on breakfast cereals no lon-
ger included cartoons or animals, such as the bunny
from the Trix Cereal [10].
Following the mandatory FOP labels, a few compan-
ies have attempted to decrease the warning effects by
including other labels on the same package. To offer an
example of this marketing strategy, a package of cook-
ies can include labels such as: Suggested portion = 3
cookies → 101 cal; 100 g. = 15 cookies → 3 logos ‘high
in sugars,’ ‘high in saturated fats,’ ‘high in calories.’ The
focus group participants had barely noticed these sug-
gested additional labels. Some mothers thought that
these suggestions were part of the regulation and were
not aware that were a marketing response from the in-
dustry. Furthermore, some mothers stated that they did
not understand what the label was suggesting. For
instance,
“I think it is not clear. People see so many labels (...)
but they don’t understand that this happens (being
high in critical nutrients) if you eat the whole package,
but if you eat two or three (cookies), it does not affect
you” (Patricia, 5yo and 8 yo children).
In addition, the industry also used the reduction or lack
of FOP labels as a marketing strategy, which elicited con-
fusion and affected the credibility of FOP labels among a
few participants. For instance, a dairy brand advertised
that all its products were free of labels, including caramel
and chocolate-based puddings. In addition, a chocolate
breakfast cereal also reformulated its ingredients and was
free of labels. Some participants explained that they were
skeptical and suspicious when they noticed that some
products had no labels because they had anticipated that
these products would receive at least one label. Therefore,
they wondered about reformulation and the nutritional
composition that the industry was using to be qualified as
a label-free product. Regarding this discussion, Paulette,
psychologist, said: “I really don’t believe this thing of black
labels. I don’t even believe in light products. I don’t believe
in that stuff because I think… ‘what are they putting [into
the food]’ because now everything is processed, everything.”
Cross-cutting effects
Focus groups revealed that the different aspects of the
law are closely interrelated and interact with each other.
In the focus group discussion people integrated different
areas of the law (i.e., FOP labels, regulation at school,
marketing on TV) as a package of measures that fos-
tered a change of attitudes and behaviors toward healthy
eating. For instance, Adela (2yo daughter), said: “I be-
lieve that there is a change of culture in a short time, a
change that has been promoted by schools, (and) in tele-
vision.” In a similar vein, another participant asserted
that this change toward healthier eating “is promoted on
TV, on the radio, and also informed at school. Now at
school they won’t sell that much of junk food. It started
to become massive.”

 Daycares and elementary schools are becoming more
restrictive with the snacks that are allowed, and children,
particularly younger children from lower-SES, have em-
braced this new healthier culture, discussing about the
“black labels” at home and requesting their mothers to
buy them healthier snacks. This is related to the appear-
ance of FOP labels and campaigns promoted by the
Ministry of Health in public and state-funded schools.
As a result, many mothers admit that they have changed
their children’s diet, especially school snacking. For in-
stance, Carla, mother of a 9yo child, explained: “My son
eats at school. He, by his own, started to decide what he
can eat and what not, this because of these black logos
that are in the packaging.”
Camelia, mother of a 13yo girl, clearly explained how
the different aspects are intertwined:
This topic about food diet and healthy snacks has
been on the rise. First, we saw a flurry of information
on TV, and then in schools. And let’s say that your
children, because of all the information they receive at
school, then they transmit it to you at home. Because
of that, you have to change the option of what you give
them as snack. For example, the thing that happens
with cookies, now you give your kid cookies to take to
school, and you’ll be like ‘what kind of mother am I.’ It
appeared on the news and everywhere that the worst
that you can give your children are cookies.
Mothers admitted they felt a pressure from the school –
and society in general—about their children’s healthy eat-
ing. Participants, particularly from middle and upper-SES,
expressed that they felt “guilty” and “bad mothers” if they
did not send healthy snacks to school:
P1: When they [the children] got home with all these
[information about healthy snacks] from school, I had
to assume… all their classmates will take healthy
snacks, so they cannot take chips.
I: How did you feel? Observed?
P1: No, you feel [being] bad mother.
P2: Yes, I feel being terrible mom when I see her eating
chips. I let her do it sometimes because in a party I
won’t say ‘don’t eat’ but I know it’s not good for her.
Discussion
In this qualitative study, we explored how Chilean
mothers of young children understand and perceive the
new regulation of food labeling and advertising. We found
that mothers were aware that the more stop signs, the
unhealthier the product and that many of them declare
using FOP labels, particularly when purchasing new prod-
ucts. We also found that mothers perceive that school
environments have become healthier as a result of the
implementation of the law, although other aspects of
the marketing restrictions are rarely perceived or no-
ticed. Interestingly, the mothers’ discourses reflect that
the effects of the different aspects of the law (FOP,
school environments and marketing regulation) are all
interrelated and operate in coordination to promote
healthier behaviors. They also show that children, par-
ticularly young children from lower- and middle- SES,
have become key disseminators of the messages under-
lying this regulatory effort.
FOP labels have been indicated as a key measure for the
prevention of obesity [12, 20, 21]. Evidence suggests that
the simpler the message, the higher the impact on con-
sumer’s behavior [22]. Furthermore, research has also
found that warning monochromatic FOP labels that flag
products high in key critical nutrients improve consumers’
abilities to identify unhealthy food compared to Guideline
Daily Amounts (GDA) and traffic-light systems [23, 24].
The results of this study are in line with this evidence.
Chile has implemented a simple warning message (i.e.,
directive FOP) that aims to decrease the consumption of
unhealthy foods. We found that mothers of different SES
understand well the intended message (i.e., the more stop
signs, the unhealthier the product), although one potential
risk is that they understand that a product with one label
corresponds to a healthy product. Mothers did not com-
prehend the underlying principles that explain in which
cases a certain product should be labeled. Given that the
process of purchase takes place in seconds, this is an
intended outcome of a directive FOP like the one imple-
mented in Chile [25, 26].
We also found that the implementation of the logo
allowed “uncovering” some products. That is, it has
helped in clarifying the lack of healthiness of some food
products that had been traditionally advertised as
healthy food. Oatmeal cookies, breakfast cereals, cereal
bars, among other food categories have traditionally use
healthiness as their marketing strategy and mothers
were surprised when they found that the products had
warning labels. In addition, the level of attention and
use was gradational: mothers reported that the presence
of warning labels influenced their purchase decision
mostly when deciding about new food products. This
result is in line with current FOP label research, which
suggests that the impact on behaviors is less strong for
products in which there is a consumer loyalty [27]. Fi-
nally, regarding FOP labels, mothers’ discourses also re-
vealed that they sometimes felt that the pervasive
presence of them was overwhelming and may not end
up contributing to better decision making. Although it

 is not possible to rule out this possibility in the short
term, future research could explore whether the omni-
presence of warning labels may desensitize people in
the long run.
Regulation at schools established restrictions in terms of
promotion and selling of unhealthy foods and this was
clearly perceived by mothers who participated in the focus
groups. Many of them declared that these restrictions are
“forcing” healthier children’s behavior because they do not
have the option of buying unhealthy food products, particu-
larly in the case of adolescents that bring money to the
school; some mothers thought this was something desirable
for shaping individual’s behaviors but other mothers, par-
ticularly those from low SES, declared that they found re-
strictions were unwarranted. From the mothers’ accounts,
the analyses also revealed that the schools are going beyond
the regulation because teachers are promoting that children
should bring healthier snacks from home. Promoting
healthier food environments at schools has also been iden-
tified as a key area of action in obesity prevention [28, 29]
because there is evidence that shows how influential the
food environment is, particularly among young children
[30, 31]. This environment has a very important impact on
their food routine behavior, considering that about one
third of their total daily energy is consumed at educational
establishments [32, 33]. This is why some governments
have decided to take responsibility by becoming stricter
with dietary routines within schools and banning HEFSS
food from being sold inside the schools [6, 34].
In line with this evidence, mothers of young children de-
clared that their children are strongly influenced by the
teachers’ promotion of healthier diets, particularly with re-
spect to school snacks. In fact, some of the mothers of
young
children
felt
that
there
was
some
kind
of
demonization of those bringing unhealthy snacks and, in
some cases, they found that this healthy fashion was ex-
cessive. Among middle-SES mothers, there was a clear so-
cial pressure regarding healthiness of food to the point
that they declared feeling guilty when giving unhealthy
snacks to their kids. These discourses revealed both a
change in eating patterns and a certain resistance to this
new environment, which is expected according to research
on behavioral change [35]. Overall, as a result of the
healthier supply at schools and the role of teachers as
health promoters, in every focus group, mothers assured
that the school has become the main agent of food behav-
ioral change, highlighting the key role of schools on obes-
ity prevention [36].
In the case of marketing restrictions, the results showed
that for many mothers the changes were unnoticed. The
persuasion literature suggests that information is proc-
essed through two routes: the central route requires high
cognitive elaboration and effort and the peripheral route –
which requires lower involvement and thinking—also has
an impact based on simple associations and cues [37].
Marketing
strategies,
such
as
child-targeted
figures,
likeable character or celebrity endorsements, are proc-
essed through peripheral routes, which means that the
person does not invest much thinking about the object.
Nonetheless, marketing has an impact on the consumer
because strategies can make the product -in this case the
food- attractive, eliciting a positive feelings through associ-
ations. Therefore, it is not surprising that the mothers of
young children have not noticed the changes in marketing
strategies, which does not necessarily imply that market-
ing restrictions have not had an impact on consumer’s
behaviors.
Besides the marketing restrictions, the industry has
responded with several advertising strategies that include
competing FOP labels that suggest ideal portion sizes of
consumption. Many of them had gone almost unnoticed
by participants or cause some confusion. A few people
thought that they were part of the regulation. In
addition, messages about being a logo-free product or a
logo-free brand elicited skepticism among mothers –
they did not believe that some products that looked un-
healthy were not subject to be labeled- and triggered a
negative halo effect, in which a few participants extrapo-
lated the skepticism toward a specific product and be-
came suspicious about the global regulation [38].
Finally, the focus groups revealed cross-cutting effects,
that is, the different aspects of the law are closely inter-
twined. Currently, schools not only restrict the selling of
“labeled” products inside their facilities, but they have be-
come key promoters of healthier food and snacks. The (lack
of) warning labels are also present in the marketing strat-
egies employed by the food industry, particularly on televi-
sion. Thus, the discourses about the importance of
healthier food environments are more pervasive. Young
children have been receptive to these messages and changes
in the discourses and behaviors and use the labels as a use-
ful shortcut to categorize healthy vs. unhealthy food. As a
result, they have become change agents in their families by
forcing or persuading their mothers to change some food
consumption habits. In some cases, there has been resist-
ance, skepticism and criticisms about possible oversatura-
tion, but the fact that people think and discuss about these
issues mean that the discourses about health and food are
pervading different sectors of society and may have
long-term effects through changes in social norms.
A key strength of this study was the use of focus
groups, which provided the opportunity to understand
the complexities of how a new policy is received, dis-
cussed and experienced by one of the groups impacted
by the regulation. Particularly, focus groups allowed ob-
serving how mothers of young children –a key stake-
holder of the new policy—discussed and expressed their
ideas
about
the
perceived
opportunities,
strengths,

Page 8 of 10
 challenges and shortcomings of the regulation and even-
tually understand more clearly their discourses, attitudes
and self-reported behaviors after the law was imple-
mented. Although the dynamics of focus groups may be
led by a few dominant voices and participants may tend
to acquiesce in front of the researcher, the investigator
explicitly stated that “there were no right or wrong opin-
ions or answers.” Then, with the help of a research as-
sistant, purposefully asked questions that avoided social
desirability and acquiescence response bias and encour-
aged the participation of all the members in each section
of questions. To avoid group thinking, they used follow-
up questions to clarify consistencies or inconsistencies
with participant’s previous opinions. Another limitation
is that the law itself could have increased social desir-
ability bias and might have altered the answers mothers
gave with regards to their food habits and beliefs in a so-
cial group. To avoid social desirability, future research
could also use on participant observations in the house-
holds and schools. These results should be contrasted
and complemented with quantitative research that exam-
ines family food habits. Finally, we recruited mothers be-
cause the evidence shows that they are the main food
gatekeepers in the household [11]. In addition, most sin-
gle-parent households are led by women and only 1,6% by
men [39]. Although a very small percentage are led by
men, future studies might include their perspective.
Conclusions
After the first year of implementation, the focus groups
revealed that the regulation was well known by mothers
who belonged to lower, middle and upper SES and had
children of different ages. The degree of use of warning
labels was heterogeneous among participants, but most
of them agreed that their children, particularly the youn-
gest ones, had positive attitudes toward the regulation
due to its high dissemination in schools and daycares.
Many mothers also expressed that they perceived an im-
portant shift toward a healthier dietary pattern, which
may lead to a change in eating social norms. We believe
the present study contributes to better understanding
how regulatory efforts can modify people’s behaviors and
what are the potential pathways implicated in the posi-
tive and negative responses of consumers. This type of
information results critical for understanding the impact
of regulations as well as for guiding future adaptations
or complementary actions.
