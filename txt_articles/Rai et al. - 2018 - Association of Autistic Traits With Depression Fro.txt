IMPORTANCE Population-based studies following trajectories of depression in autism
spectrum disorders (ASD) from childhood into early adulthood are rare. The role of genetic
confounding and of potential environmental intermediaries, such as bullying, in any
associations is unclear.
OBJECTIVES To compare trajectories of depressive symptoms from ages 10 to 18 years for
children with or without ASD and autistic traits, to assess associations between ASD and
autistic traits and an International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10)
depression diagnosis at age 18 years, and to explore the importance of genetic confounding
and bullying.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Longitudinal study of participants in the Avon
Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children birth cohort in Bristol, United Kingdom, followed
up through age 18 years. Data analysis was conducted from January to November 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Short Mood
and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) at 6 time points between ages 10 and 18 years. An
ICD-10 depression diagnosis at age 18 years was established using the Clinical Interview
Schedule–Revised. Exposures were ASD diagnosis and 4 dichotomized autistic traits (social
communication, coherence, repetitive behavior, and sociability). An autism polygenic risk
score was derived using the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium autism discovery genome-wide
association study summary data. Bullying was assessed at ages 8, 10, and 13 years.
RESULTS The maximum sample with complete data was 6091 for the trajectory analysis
(48.8% male) and 3168 for analysis of depression diagnosis at age 18 years (44.4% male).
Children with ASD and autistic traits had higher average SMFQ depressive symptom scores
than the general population at age 10 years (eg, for social communication 5.55 [95% CI,
5.16-5.95] vs 3.73 [95% CI, 3.61-3.85], for ASD 7.31 [95% CI, 6.22-8.40] vs 3.94 [95% CI,
3.83-4.05], remaining elevated in an upward trajectory until age 18 years (eg, for social
communication 7.65 [95% CI, 6.92-8.37] vs 6.50 [95% CI, 6.29-6.71], for ASD 7.66 [95% CI,
5.96-9.35] vs 6.62 [95% CI, 6.43-6.81]). Social communication impairments were associated
with depression at age 18 years (adjusted relative risk, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.05-2.70), and bullying
explained a substantial proportion of this risk. There was no evidence of confounding by the
autism polygenic risk score. Analysis in larger samples using multiple imputation led to similar
but more precise results.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Children with ASD and ASD traits have higher depressive
symptom scores than the general population by age 10 years, which persist to age 18 years,
particularly in the context of bullying. Social communication impairments are an important
autistic trait in relation to depression. Bullying, as an environmental intermediary, could be
a target for interventions.

 A
utism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by
impairments in reciprocal social interaction and by re-
petitive and stereotyped interests and behaviors.1 The
autism spectrum is a heterogeneous construct, and its com-
ponent traits are distributed across the population,2,3 with po-
tentially distinct etiologies4,5 and outcomes. Despite increas-
ing recognition in recent years,6 there are substantial gaps in
our understanding of the outcomes of children with ASD as
they transition into adulthood.
DepressionisdisablingandiscommoninchildrenwithASD,
but few longitudinal population-based studies have followed
thenaturalhistoryofdepressioninASDoritscomponenttraits.7
Because family members of children with ASD also have an in-
creased risk of depression,8-10 a genetic overlap between ASD
anddepressionispossible.However,depressioninfamilymem-
berscouldalsorelatetodifficultiesassociatedwithhavingachild
with greater needs or behavioral difficulties.
Regardless of a genetic basis, it is possible that there are
modifiable factors that could be targeted by interventions to
reduce the risk of depression in individuals with autism. In
clinical practice, individuals with autism seen with depres-
sion often report histories of traumatic experiences, particu-
larly bullying. Bullying is strongly associated with depres-
sion, an effect that may endure into adulthood,11 and could
thus be important in the association between autism and
depression.12 For instance, bullying could be a mediator on the
causal pathway between autism and depression. It is also pos-
sible that the negative effect of bullying on depression may be
amplified in the context of the social impairments in autism.
Toourknowledge,nolongitudinalstudieshaveexploredthese
potential mechanisms.
This study used data from a large population-based cohort
in England. Our objectives were to (1) compare trajectories of
depressive symptoms from ages 10 to 18 years for children with
or without ASD or high scores on autistic trait measures, (2) as-
sess whether children with ASD and autistic traits were at in-
creased risk of depression at age 18 years, (3) explore the role
ofgeneticconfoundingintheseassociations,and(4)explorethe
importance of bullying in any associations.
Methods
Study Cohort
The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children
(ALSPAC) is a birth cohort study that enrolled mothers in early
pregnancy in Bristol and surrounding areas in 1990 to 1992 in
England.13,14 It has detailed information on parents and chil-
dren, collected prospectively at multiple times during preg-
nancy and throughout childhood. Data sources include self-
reportquestionnaires,clinicalassessments,biologicalsamples,
and birth, medical, and educational records. The study web-
site contains details of all the data available in a fully search-
able format (http://www.bris.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/data-
access/data-dictionary/). We used all available data for each
combinationofexposureandoutcome,andweimputedvalues
for missing covariate data using multiple imputation (details
are shown in eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
Ethical approval for all data collected in the ALSPAC was
obtained from the ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee and the
local research ethics committees. Participants provided writ-
ten informed consent for all clinic assessments, and consent
was implied if questionnaires were returned. Participants were
followed up through age 18 years. Data analysis was con-
ducted from January to November 2017.
Ascertainment of Autism and Autistic Traits
We identified children with ASD using a multisource ap-
proach,includingareviewofclinicalrecordsofallchildrenwho
had multidisciplinary assessment for a developmental disor-
der (validated against International Statistical Classification of
Diseases, 10th Revision [ICD-10] criteria by a consultant
pediatrician15), educational records of special education sup-
port provided for ASD, and parental reports of an autism or
Aspergersyndromediagnosis.16TheASDcaseshavebeencross-
validated against the ASD trait measures,16,17 and as reported
below in the Results section, they are associated with a poly-
genic risk score (PRS) for autism.
By age 11 years, the ALSPAC had collected 93 measures re-
lated to autistic features.18 Of these, the following 4 individual
measureswerethestrongestpredictorsofASD18:theSocialCom-
munication Disorders Checklist (SCDC) at 7 years, the coher-
ence subscale of the Children’
s Communication Checklist at 9
years, a repetitive behavior scale at 5 years, and the sociability
subscale of the Emotionality Activity and Sociability tempera-
ment measure at 3 years.16 To define high-risk groups for these
autistictraits,wedichotomizedindividualsclosesttotheworst
10% of distributions of each ASD trait measure.17
Ascertainment of Depression and Depressive Traits
The Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ),19 de-
signed to measure depressive symptoms in children and ado-
lescents, was administered at 6 time points between ages 10
and 18 years via postal questionnaires or in clinics. It has 13
items relating to low mood during the past 2 weeks, each with
scores of 0 to 2. Individual item scores were summed, pro-
ducing a 0 to 26 score range.20
The computerized version of the Clinical Interview Sched-
ule–Revised (CIS-R)21 is a fully structured psychiatric inter-
view widely used in community samples. It was adminis-
Key Points
Question Are children with autism and autistic traits at greater
risk of depression at age 18 years, and are genetic confounding
and bullying important in these associations?
Findings Among 6091 participants in this longitudinal study,
children with autism and autistic traits had higher depressive
symptom scores than the general population at age 10 years,
remaining elevated in an upward trajectory until age 18 years.
Social communication impairment was associated with depression
at 18 years and was substantially mediated by bullying.
Meaning Social communication impairments are an important
autistic trait in relation to depression; bullying may be an
environmental intermediary and a target for interventions.

diagnosis of depression.
Potential Confounders
Weincludedthefollowingvariablesinourmodels:(1)childsex,
(2) parity (≤1 child vs ≥2 children), (3) maternal occupational
class (manual vs nonmanual), (4) mother’
s highest educa-
tional attainment, (5) financial problems (occurrence vs non-
occurrence of major financial problems), (6) maternal age at
delivery (in years), (7) maternal Crown-Crisp anxiety score at
18 weeks’gestation and 8 weeks after delivery,22 (8) maternal
antenatal (18 and 32 weeks’gestation) and postnatal (8 weeks
and 8 months) depression measured with the Edinburgh Post-
natal Depression Scale (EPDS score ≥13),23 and (9) accommo-
dation type (detached house vs semidetached house vs flat).
We included these variables because they are associated with
both autism and depression, apart from being predictors of at-
trition in the ALSPAC.
Bullying in Late Childhood and Early Adolescence
Relational and overt bullying was assessed as separate yes or
no items at ages 8, 10, and 13 years using the modified Bully-
ing and Friendship Interview Schedule.24 We created a latent
construct of bullying based on 6 binary measures (relational
and overt bullying assessed at ages 8, 10, and 13 years) using
factor analysis to identify the common variance in the items.
Conceptually, this latent construct represents the tendency of
childrentobebulliedpersistentlythroughoutchildhoodorado-
lescenceandwasusedforthemediationanalysisdescribedbe-
low in the Statistical Analysis subsection. We also created a bi-
nary variable to capture no vs any overt or relational bullying
at any time, which we used for testing interactions described
below in the Statistical Analysis subsection.
PRS for Autism
We examined potential genetic confounding of associations
between ASD and depression using autism PRSs, calculated
for genotyped ALSPAC children using summary data from
the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium autism discovery
genome-wide association study (GWAS) (eMethods 1 in the
Supplement).25 We created a set of scores based on single-
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were associated with
an ASD diagnosis at a range of GWAS P value thresholds (.5 to
1e−7)andusedPRSsgeneratedusingSNPsmeetinga0.05GWAS
P value threshold in our main analysis because it maximally
captured autism liability within our sample (eFigure 2 in the
Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
We conducted analyses using Stata/MP (version 14; StataCorp)
and Mplus (version 8; Muthén & Muthén). We examined tra-
jectoriesofdepressivesymptoms(continuousSMFQscores)be-
tween ages 10 and 18 years among those with or without ASD
and each autistic trait using mixed-effects linear growth mod-
els.Toaccommodateindividualdifferencesintrendsofdepres-
sive symptoms with age, we included random effects for inter-
ceptandslopecoefficientsandaddedquadraticandcubicterms
to accommodate potential nonlinear trends.
We then used modified Poisson regression to estimate the
relative risk (RR) of an ICD-10 depression diagnosis at age 18
years in individuals with ASD and each autistic trait vs those
without, with robust 95% CIs.26 We estimated crude risks, fol-
lowed by adjustment for all potential confounders. We fur-
ther adjusted these models for the autism PRS in the sample
with genetic data.
We used path analysis to assess mediation of associa-
tions between autistic traits and depression at age 18 years
by the experience of being bullied in late childhood or early
adolescence using latent constructs of bullying and depres-
sion. Details are provided in eMethods 2 and eMethods 3 in
the Supplement.
Finally,toseparatetheassociationofASDdiagnosisortraits
with depression within and outside the context of bullying, we
created categories representing 4 groups by the presence or ab-
sence of ASD or ASD traits and the presence or absence of any
experiencing of bullying; we compared trajectories of depres-
sive traits between ages 10 and 18 years using mixed-effects
linear growth models as described above in the Statistical
Analysis subsection. To statistically test moderating associa-
tions of bullying, we compared models that included the ASD
and bullying variables with those that included only the ASD
variable; we then compared models that included the statis-
tical interaction between the ASD and bullying variables with
models that included only the main effects of these variables
using likelihood ratio tests.
Missing Data
Missingdatainourtrajectoryandage18yearsanalysisarelisted
in eTable 4 in the Supplement. We imputed missing data for
covariates and outcome using multiple imputation (eFigure 1,
eMethods 4 in the Supplement). The availability of extensive
auxiliary socioeconomic and clinical data (including 7 mea-
sures of depression between ages 10 and 18 years) enabled us
toaccountforfactorsthatmayexplainattrition,providingsup-
port to the missing-at-random assumption.27 We repeated our
analyses, estimating average associations across 100 im-
puted data sets and calculated standard errors using the rule
by Rubin.28
Results
The maximum sample available with complete data on expo-
sures, outcomes, and covariates was 6091 for the trajectory
analysis (48.8% male) and 3168 for analysis of depression di-
agnosis at age 18 years (44.4% male) (eFigure 1 in the Supple-
ment). The characteristics of our study sample by the pres-
ence of ASD and autistic traits are listed in eTable 1 in the
Supplement (with an abridged version in Table 1). Mothers of
children scoring highest on all autistic trait measures except
sociability had a greater prevalence of screening positive for
depression and had higher mean anxiety scores in pregnancy
and the early postnatal period than the general population, al-
though this pattern was not observed in children with ASD.
Children with ASD and those scoring highest on all the autis-
tic traits had a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms at

 age 10 years, a pattern that was also observed at other time
points,albeitinconsistently(eTable2intheSupplement).Chil-
dren with ASD and those scoring highest on the autistic trait
measures had a consistently greater prevalence of overt and
relational bullying at ages 8, 10, and 13 years than the com-
parison population, although the statistical evidence for such
differences varied (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
The autism PRS was associated with the ASD diagnosis and
with measures of social communication and repetitive behav-
ior (eFigure 2 in the Supplement), while being in the top decile
of the autism PRS was associated with ASD and all 4 autism
trait measures, with the exception of coherence (eFigure 3 in
theSupplement).Resultsweregenerallyconsistentwhenusing
autism PRSs generated using SNP inclusion P value thresh-
olds exceeding .001. There was no evidence of associations be-
tween the autism PRS and depression or bullying variables
(eFigure 4 and eFigure 5 in the Supplement).
Examining trajectories, children with ASD and autistic
traits had higher average SMFQ depressive symptom scores
than the general population at age 10 years (eg, for social com-
munication 5.55 [95% CI, 5.16-5.95] vs 3.73 [95% CI, 3.61-
3.85], for ASD 7.31 [95% CI, 6.22-8.40] vs 3.94 [95% CI, 3.83-
4.05], remaining elevated in an upward trajectory until age 18
years (eg, for social communication 7.65 [95% CI, 6.92-8.37]
vs 6.50 [95% CI, 6.29-6.71], for ASD 7.66 [95% CI, 5.96-9.35]
vs 6.62 [95% CI, 6.43-6.81]) (Figure 1). Most pronounced were
differences between those with or without social communi-
cationdifficulties.Analysesusingimputeddatasetsledtosimi-
lar but more precise estimates (eFigure 6 in the Supplement).
Children with social communication impairments at age
7 years were at increased risk of a diagnosis of depression at
age 18 years (adjusted RR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.05-2.70). These as-
sociations were almost unchanged after adjustment for the au-
tism PRS (Table 2) and were estimated with greater precision
in the sample without genetic data (eTable 5 in the Supple-
ment) and after multiple imputation (eTable 6 in the Supple-
ment). No evidence of an association between ASD and a de-
pression diagnosis at age 18 years was observed, although the
95% CIs were wide in our main (adjusted RR, 0.50; 95% CI,
0.08-3.38) and imputed (adjusted RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.23-
2.81) analyses.
Children with ASD and autistic traits who also reported
being bullied had the highest depression symptom scores at
age 10 years, which remained elevated throughout adoles-
cence (Figure 2). There was statistical evidence that the model
thatincludedtheASDandbullyingvariablesexplainedthedata
better than one that included only ASD diagnosis (likelihood
ratio χ2 = 454.75, P < .001) and that models with interaction
termsforASDandbullyingexplainedthedatabetterthanmod-
els that included only the main effects of these variables (like-

most apparent for children with social communication diffi-
culties and were least apparent for worst scores on sociability
temperament.Intheabsenceofbullying,thedepressivesymp-
tom trajectories of children with or without ASD or autistic
traits appeared broadly similar. Analyses using imputed data
sets led to similar results (eFigure 7 in the Supplement).
Finally, we assessed for mediation of associations be-
tween social communication difficulties at 7 years and diag-
nosed depression at age 18 years by the experience of being
bullied in late childhood and early adolescence (Table 3). Both
before and after adjustment for potential confounders, there
was strong evidence of an indirect pathway leading from so-
cialcommunicationdifficultiesinearlychildhoodtobeingbul-
lied in late childhood or early adolescence to a depression di-
agnosis at age 18 years. We estimated that this indirect
association accounted for 50.5% (95% CI, 5.5%-95.5%) of the
total association of social communication difficulties with risk

 of depression after accounting for potential confounders. Fur-
thermore, there was no evidence of a direct association of so-
cial communication difficulties with depression risk after ac-
counting for the indirect association via bullying. Repeating
these analyses using imputed data led to similar results (eTable
7 in the Supplement), with a more precise estimate of the in-
direct association accounted for by bullying (31.5%; 95% CI,
17.3%-45.7%).
Discussion
In this detailed longitudinal study, we found that children with
ASD and those with higher scores on all autistic trait mea-
sures had more depressive symptoms at age 10 years than the
general population, and these remained elevated in an up-
ward trajectory until age 18 years. Social communication im-
pairments had the strongest association with a depression di-
agnosis at age 18 years. Findings were robust to adjustment for
a range of confounders, including maternal depression and
anxiety and the child’
s polygenic risk for autism. We found evi-
dence of a substantial role of bullying in contributing to and
explaining a higher risk of depression in individuals with ASD
and autistic symptoms.
Previousreportsonthistopichavebeencontradictory,with
results of some studies29,30 suggesting an improvement in de-
pressivesymptomsinchildrenwithautismovertimeandother
findings suggesting worsening,31 possibly because of se-
lected and heterogeneous populations and different meth-
ods. The lack of a general population group in previous stud-
ies makes it difficult to conclude whether the trajectories of
depressive symptoms in the autistic population differ from
those of the general population,29-32 a limitation in the litera-
ture that our study attempted to address. Our findings sug-
gesting that difficulties in social communication may have
stronger associations with future depression than other au-
tistic traits have also been reported for outcomes of suicidal
thoughts and behaviors33 and are consistent with the con-
cept of fractionation of component features of the autism
spectrum.4 However, although social communication diffi-
culties are an important feature of autism, they may occur in-
dependently in the population or within the context of other
psychiatric diagnoses. Therefore, the association between so-
cial communication difficulties and depression may be im-
portant within and outside the context of ASD.
We report a significant contribution of bullying as a po-
tential environmental intermediary between childhood autis-
tic features and later depression. Previous work has shown
strong links between the experience of bullying and later
depression34,35; although confounding could have a role,36 the
association is considered to be at least partially causal.11 In our
study, children with social communication impairments were
more likely to report being bullied, and the mediation analy-
sis suggests that this explained a substantial proportion of the
variance of depression at age 18 years, possibly due to re-
ducedself-esteemorsocialisolationafterthebullying.Therisk
of depression in children with greater autistic symptoms may
also be amplified in the context of bullying because of preex-
isting underlying vulnerabilities in children with autistic fea-
tures, such as impaired social skills and decreased ability to
adapt to adverse or stressful events, such as being bullied. This
could explain the elevated trajectories of depressive symp-
tomsinchildrenwithASDandautistictraitswhoreportedbeing
bullied. In the absence of bullying, these children appeared to
follow trajectories of depressive symptoms similar to those of
the general population. However, such interactions could sim-
ply suggest that bullying and autism sometimes co-occur in
causal models of depression, as might be expected for any out-
come of multifactorial etiology.37
Although it is impossible to identify the exact nature of the
underlying mechanisms, our results highlight the need for fur-
ther research on the role of bullying in this association and the
potential for preventive interventions. Furthermore, other rel-
evant characteristics, including comorbidities with neurode-
velopmentalconditions(eg,attention-deficit/hyperactivitydis-
order) and classroom placement could be important in this
association within or outside the context of bullying and war-
rant future study.
The main strengths of this study were the population-
based design with prospectively collected data and repeated

 Limitations
This study has limitations. Like all cohort studies, there was
significant attrition, and we used multiple imputation to
limit any potential bias; however, selection bias related to
missing data remains a possibility. While the use of PRSs was
an advantage, they only capture common variation and were
based on a small GWAS, so genetic confounding in the asso-
ciations is still possible. We had insufficient numbers with
an ASD diagnosis also meeting the diagnostic criteria for
depression at 18 years, possibly due to selective attrition of
individuals with autism with more severe depressive symp-
toms. This is likely to have led to the imprecise result
because of a lack of statistical power. Furthermore, atypical
presentations of depression are common in ASD, and our
study has the potential for outcome measurement error
because we used scales (eg, the CIS-R) that have not been
adapted for autism.38 Individuals with ASD may also have
difficulties in expressing and communicating their emotions
and may not have sufficient verbal skills to express changes
in their mood or feelings.38
Conclusions
Our results suggest that ASD and autistic traits are associated
with higher depressive symptom scores by age 10 years, which
persist to age 18 years, particularly in the context of bullying.
Socialcommunicationimpairmentsareimportantinrelationto
alaterdiagnosisofdepression,andbullyinginadolescencecould
have an important role in this association. These findings add
totheevidencehighlightingahigherburdenofdepression,and
also suggest a potentially modifiable pathway, through bully-
ing. However, gaps remain in our understanding of the mea-
surementandphenomenologyofdepressioninindividualswith
autism, which could be a priority for future research. Further
work could also focus on improvements in psychological39 and
pharmacological40 management of depression in ASD. Finally,
further research into the role of traumatic experiences, such as
bullying, and the utility of interventions to reduce bullying or
address its adverse effects could have the potential to reduce
the burden of depression in this population.
