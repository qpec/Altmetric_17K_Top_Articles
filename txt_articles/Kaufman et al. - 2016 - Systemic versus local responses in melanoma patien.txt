Abstract
Background: We previously reported that talimogene laherparepvec, an oncolytic herpes virus encoding
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), resulted in an objective response rate of 26 % in
patients with advanced melanoma in a phase II clinical trial. The response of individual lesions, however, was
not reported. Since talimogene laherparepvec is thought to mediate anti-tumor activity through both direct
tumor cytolysis and induction of systemic tumor-specific immunity, we sought to determine the independent
response rate in virus-injected and non-injected lesions.
Methods: Fifty patients with stage IIIC or IV melanoma were treated with talimogene laherparepvec in a
multi-institutional single-arm open-label phase II clinical trial. In this study patients were treated until a complete
response was achieved, all accessible tumors disappeared, clinically significant disease progression, or unacceptable
toxicity. This report is a post hoc analysis of the systemic effects of talimogene laherparepvec in injected lesions and
two types of uninjected lesions—non-visceral lesions and visceral lesions.
Results: Eleven of 23 patients (47.8 %) had a ≥ 30 % reduction in the total burden of uninjected non-visceral lesions,
and 2 of 12 patients (16.7 %) had a ≥ 30 % reduction in the total burden of visceral lesions. Among 128 evaluable
lesions directly injected with talimogene laherparepvec, 86 (67.2 %) decreased in size by ≥ 30 % and 59 (46.1 %)
completely resolved. Of 146 uninjected non-visceral lesions, 60 (41.1 %) decreased in size by ≥ 30 %, the majority of
which (44 [30.1 %]) completely resolved. Of 32 visceral lesions, 4 (12.5 %) decreased in size by ≥ 30 %, and 3 (9.4 %)
completely resolved. The median time to lesion response was shortest for lesions that were directly injected (18.4 weeks),
followed by uninjected non-visceral lesions (23.1 weeks) and visceral lesions (51.3 weeks), consistent with initiation of a
delayed regional and systemic anti-tumor immune response to talimogene laherparepvec.
Conclusions: These results support a regional and systemic effect of talimogene laherparepvec immunotherapy in
patients with advanced melanoma.

 Background
The therapeutic landscape for the treatment of metastatic
melanoma has been changing dramatically over the last
few years driven by progress in the clinical application of
targeted therapy and tumor immunotherapy [1]. Immuno-
therapy has gained considerable attention, in part because
of high response rates with some monotherapy and com-
bination therapy regimens (such as immune checkpoint
inhibitors), evidence of overall survival benefit in random-
ized clinical trials, and the durability often obtained with
immunotherapy agents [2–4]. There is now emerging evi-
dence that lymphocyte-predominant tumors, character-
ized with high numbers of effector T cells (and a weighted
effector T cell/regulatory T cell ratio), may be more sus-
ceptible to immunotherapy and strategies to increase the
lymphocytic infiltration to tumors are a high priority for
improving clinical responses to immunotherapy.
Talimogene laherparepvec, an oncolytic herpes simplex
virus type 1 (HSV-1) [5], was gene modified to elicit in-
creased selectivity and rescue replication in tumors as well
as improved tumor antigen presentation. It contains dele-
tions of the neurovirulence factors ICP34.5 and a factor
that blocks peptide loading onto the major histocompati-
bility complex (MHC) called ICP47. These changes reduce
the pathogenicity of the virus. Talimogene laherparepvec
also contains an insertion of the human granulocyte-
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene se-
quence at the deleted ICP34.5 coding sequence sites to
enhance systemic immune response [6]. We previously
reported that in a multi-institutional, single-arm, open-
label, phase II clinical trial, intralesional injection of tali-
mogene laherparepvec resulted in an ORR of 26 % in
patients with stage IIIC and stage IV melanoma. The ma-
jority of responding patients had a durable remission in
both injected and uninjected non-visceral lesions (with
MART-specific CD8+ T cells observed in both subsets) [7]
including visceral sites for 7–31 months, indicating a pos-
sible systemic effect [8]. Recently, a randomized phase III
clinical trial confirmed this objective response rate and
demonstrated an especially high durable response rate for
patients with stage IIIB/C and IV M1a disease [9]. This
trial led to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approval of talimogene laherparepvec for local treatment
of unresectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, and nodal le-
sions in patients with melanoma recurrent after initial sur-
gery. Talimogene laherparepvec has not been shown to
improve overall survival in patients with visceral metasta-
ses [10]. Talimogene laherparepvec has been associated
with a tolerable safety profile and provides a new strategy
for directly killing tumor cells, promoting local lympho-
cyte infiltration, and use in combination regimens to im-
prove clinical responses to tumor immunotherapy. The
ability of talimogene laherparepvec to mediate systemic
clinical anti-tumor activity compared to exerting a more
local effect on lymphocyte responses has been previously
described [8] but not fully quantified.
This report is a post hoc analysis from a phase II study in
melanoma of potential systemic effects of talimogene laher-
parepvec based on an analysis of individual virus-injected
lesions and two types of uninjected lesions—non-visceral
lesions and visceral lesions. We sought to determine the
independent response rate as well as median time to lesion
response in these different types of lesions. The results pro-
vide insight into the level of systemic activity possible with
talimogene laherparepvec in patients with melanoma and
provide support for combination studies in which talimo-
gene laherparepvec-induced anti-tumor immunity can be
enhanced with other agents known to expand or inhibit
suppression of antigen-specific T cells.
Methods
Study design
The full details of the overall design and methods for the
phase II clinical trial have been previously reported [8].
Briefly, patients received up to 8 doses of talimogene laher-
parepvec over a 15-week period. Talimogene laherparep-
vec was administered at an initial dose of 106 plaque-
forming units (PFU)/mL and injected into 1 or more skin
or subcutaneous lesions (up to 4 mL total). Subsequent
doses began 3 weeks after the first dose and consisted of
talimogene laherparepvec at 108 PFU/mL (up to 4 mL
total) every 2 weeks. The volume of talimogene laherpar-
epvec delivered to each lesion depended on the size of the
lesion measured on the day of virus administration. In this
study, at least 1 lesion was to be left uninjected to assess
systemic response. Uninjected lesions were to be at least
5 cm from the nearest injected lesion. Tumor responses
were derived based on modified Response Evaluation Cri-
teria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0.
If indications of biological activity were observed after
the initial 8 doses (stable disease or better, inflammatory
response in an uninjected non-visceral lesion, and/or in-
jection site reaction) and patients did not have evidence of
clinically symptomatic disease progression or unacceptable
toxicity, treatment could be continued for an additional
16 doses unless the investigator determined that another
therapy was appropriate.
The protocol was approved by the site investigational
review boards (see Acknowledgements) and by the U.S.
FDA under an investigational new drug application. All
patients provided written informed consent.
Response analysis in injected and uninjected lesions
To evaluate the systemic effect of talimogene laherpar-
epvec (ie, beyond local effects in injected lesions), the
following endpoints were evaluated by lesion type: pa-
tient incidence of overall lesion-type response, incidence
of lesion response, maximum decrease in tumor burden
Kaufman et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2016) 4:12 
Page 2 of 8
 (individual lesion and overall by lesion type) and the
time to individual lesion response. Analyses of systemic
effects were based on baseline or new measurable lesions
from patients in a pre-planned safety analysis popula-
tion. Evaluable lesions were defined as those with mea-
surements recorded at ≥ 2 visits (with a measurable
lesion size noted in the earliest assessment). All ana-
lyses were based on investigator assessment of lesion
measurements and lesion injection status.
Statistical analysis
For this study descriptive statistics were used. Measur-
able lesion characteristics were displayed by lesion
type (injected, uninjected non-visceral, and visceral),
and the patient incidences of measurable lesion loca-
tions were tabulated by lesion type. Overall lesion-type
burden was calculated as the sum of the longest diam-
eters of all lesions of the same type at a study visit.
The patient incidence of overall lesion response was
reported as the proportion of patients with a ≥ 30 %
decrease in overall lesion burden by lesion type.
Graphical presentations of the maximum decrease in
overall lesion-type burden were produced using water-
fall plots. The maximum decrease in the size of indi-
vidual lesions (based on the longest diameter) was
categorized (>0 %, ≥ 30 %, 100 %) and presented by le-
sion type. The incidence of lesion response was reported
as the proportion of lesions with a ≥ 30 % decrease in size.
Graphical presentations of the maximum decrease in
baseline or new measurable lesions were produced using
waterfall plots.
The time to lesion response by lesion type was ana-
lyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method for all evaluable
lesions of the same lesion type. Kaplan-Meier estimates
of event quartiles and the corresponding 95 % confi-
dence intervals, when estimable, were based on a sign
test [11]. Time to lesion response was evaluated from
the date of the baseline measurement to the date of first
response (for new lesions, the first appearance of the
lesion was considered the baseline measurement).
Results
Measurable lesion characteristics
Evaluable patients for the lesion-level analyses (patients
with at least 1 lesion with measurements at ≥ 2 visits) and
overall lesion-type burden analyses (patients with ≥ 2 visits
with measurement of all lesions of the same type) are sum-
marized in Table 1. Of the 50 patients who received talimo-
gene laherparepvec injected into a lesion in the phase II
clinical trial, 48 patients (96.0 %) also had at least 1 unin-
jected lesion (Table 1). This included 26 patients (52.0 %)
with only uninjected non-visceral lesions at baseline and 22
patients (44.0 %) with at least 1 visceral lesion at baseline.
Of 400 baseline or new lesions, 306 were evaluable (i.e., had
measurements at ≥ 2 visits), including 146 (47.7 %) unin-
jected non-visceral lesions and 32 (10.5 %) visceral lesions).
The most common anatomic locations of uninjected, non-
visceral lesions were lymph nodes, cutaneous metastases,
or subcutaneous nodules. Visceral lesions were most com-
monly located in the lungs and liver (Table 2).
Patient incidence of overall lesion-type response
Of the 23 evaluable patients with baseline uninjected
non-visceral disease, 11 patients (47.8 %) had a ≥ 30 %
reduction in the total burden of uninjected non-visceral
lesions (Table 3). Of the 12 evaluable patients with vis-
ceral disease, 2 patients (16.7 %) had a ≥ 30 % reduction
in the total burden of visceral lesions. In general, the ob-
served response rate per investigator was consistent with
the rate of overall lesion-type response (derived from the
tumor burden change within a lesion subset; see Table 3).
The overall tumor response rate for patients with only
uninjected non-visceral lesions was 43.5 % per investiga-
tor and 47.8 % based on the change in the total patient
burden of uninjected non-visceral lesions. The overall
tumor response rate for patients with visceral-only le-
sions was 16.7 %, both per investigator and based on the
change in the total patient burden of visceral lesions.

ual lesions is shown in Fig. 1a. Among 128 evaluable

 lesions directly injected with talimogene laherparepvec,
86 (67.2 %) decreased in size by ≥ 30 %, and 59 (46.1 %)
completely resolved (Fig. 1a). Responses were also ob-
served in baseline and new uninjected lesions, including
both non-visceral and visceral lesions as shown in the
waterfall plot for baseline and new measurable lesions that
appeared during the course of study treatment (Fig. 1b). Of
146 uninjected non-visceral lesions, 60 (41.1 %) decreased
in size by ≥ 30 %, the majority of which (44 [30.1 %]) com-
pletely resolved. The 44 uninjected non-visceral, non-
visceral baseline or new lesions that completely resolved
were in 6 of 24 patients with a baseline or new uninjected
non-visceral lesion that had a CR. Of 32 visceral lesions, 4
(12.5 %) decreased in size by ≥ 30 %, the majority of which
(3 [9.4 %]) completely resolved (Fig. 1c). The 3 baseline or
new visceral lesions that completely resolved were in 1 of 12
patients with baseline or new visceral lesions that had a CR.
Time to lesion response
The median time to lesion response (baseline or new le-
sions) is shown in Fig. 2 and was shortest for lesions that
were directly injected (18.4 weeks) compared to all unin-
jected non-visceral lesions (29.1 weeks). On further ana-
lysis of uninjected lesions, uninjected non-visceral lesions
responded at a median of 23.1 weeks compared to visceral
lesions which responded at a mean of 51.3 weeks. These
results are consistent with initiation of a delayed regional
and systemic anti-tumor immune response to talimogene
laherparepvec.
Discussion
Talimogene laherparepvec is an oncolytic herpes virus en-
coding GM-CSF and was designed to exert anti-tumor ef-
fects through both a direct oncolytic effect in injected
lesions and through induction of systemic anti-tumor im-
munity. In a multi-institutional phase II clinical trial, an
objective response rate of 26 % was reported and evidence
of systemic anti-tumor immunity was also seen with
MART-specific CD8+ T cells observed in both injected
and uninjected lesions of responding patients [8]. In this

 post hoc analysis, we confirmed the total tumor burden
reduction in both types of uninjected lesions—uninjected
non-visceral and visceral lesions—as evidence of both re-
gional and systemic immune response elicited by talimo-
gene laherparepvec. However, the regional response rate
was higher than systemic responses when analyzing both
total tumor burden and individual tumor lesions. While
this could relate to a slowly expanding T cell response
primed close to the site of virus injection, it may also sug-
gest that direct injection and oncolysis are important for
maximizing therapeutic response of individual tumor le-
sions. Interestingly, the majority of lesions that had
≥ 30 % reduction in size went on to complete resolution,
and this was seen across all types of lesions—injected,
uninjected non-visceral, and visceral lesions. This supports
the possibility that talimogene laherparepvec can success-
fully induce an effective systemic anti-tumor response
with only a local, intratumoral, injection and immunother-
apy mechanism as an important component of the mech-
anism of action for talimogene laherparepvec.

 Numerous attempts to incite or modulate systemic im-
mune responses via intralesional immunotherapy have been
reported over the last 50 years. One of the earliest studies
dates back to the 1970s when Dr. Donald Morton at the
John Wayne Cancer Institute reported the effect of intrale-
sional Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) in a cohort of
patients with unresectable melanoma [12], although a subse-
quent randomized phase III trial failed to prove the systemic
efficacy of this approach in 2004 [13]. Nevertheless, a num-
ber of phase I/II studies with intralesional cytokines (eg,
GM-CSF, IL-2, interferons), viruses (eg, HSV-1, Coxsackie-
virus, Poxviruses), and plasmids (eg, Allovectin) have been
conducted but their use has remained sporadic, and they
have not progressed to become established treatments
[14–17]. Talimogene laherparepvec was designed to increase
both oncolytic effects through modulation of the HSV-1 vec-
tor for tumor-specific HSV-1 and to generate enhanced sys-
temic response through deletion of the viral ICP47 gene and
expression of GM-CSF [5]. The herpes ICP47 gene product
blocks antigen presentation and normally prevents immune
recognition of viral antigens. When this gene product is
deleted, it is hypothesized that both viral-specific and
pre-formed tumor-specific antigens are more likely to be
presented by major histocompatibility complexes (MHC)
and thus, generate T cell responses. GM-CSF expression
within the local tumor microenvironment following injection
of talimogene laherparepvec serves as a patient-specific, in
situ, method of maturing dendritic cells and, hence priming
local cytotoxic T cell responses. These results are consistent
with other GM-CSF expressive immunotherapies [18–21]
supporting systemic clinical effect. Further studies need to be
done to better define whether viral- or tumor antigen-
induced T cell repertoires are responsible for tumor rejection
with talimogene laherparepvec and other oncolytic viruses.
In this study, we found a higher response rate of talimo-
gene laherparepvec in the control of uninjected non-
visceral lesions compared to the control of visceral lesions.
This could relate to local spread of virus, which could
mediate oncolytic effects on uninjected lesions, or it could
be due to intrinsic differences in the therapeutic effective-
ness of talimogene laherparepvec in various sites. Effector
T cells are likely primed close to the injected tumors, likely
in regional draining lymph nodes, and must be released
into the systemic circulation, where they must survive and
traffic to other sites of tumor growth. Expression of cer-
tain chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules on
T cells are essential in this homing process. T cells primed
in one location generally result in homing to a similar tis-
sue compartment [22]. For example, native herpes simplex
virus infection preferentially primes lymphocytes that
express CCR4 and CCR10, chemokine receptors that pro-
mote trafficking to the skin [23]. In contrast, gut-tropic
T cells express a high level of the chemokine receptor
CCR9 and migrate preferentially to the lamina propria of
the small intestine [24]. Dendritic cells (DCs) play an in-
structive role in efficient T cell priming and influence their
function in a tissue-specific fashion by imparting variable
chemokine receptor expression following priming [25].
DCs are also responsible for the imprinting of tissue-
specific homing potential [26, 27]. Thus, DCs from the
injected lesion may specifically prime effector T cells tar-
geting tumors in similar locations, which could explain
why uninjected non-visceral lesions were more susceptible
to rejection after talimogene laherparepvec was injected
into other skin-associated tumors. Further, the role of viral
infection, local inflammation, and delivery of GM-CSF on
the formation of resident T cells responding to tumor an-
tigens is not fully understood. Resident memory CD8+

 T cells (TRM) primed in the skin afford global protection
within the skin, but do not circulate to other sites [28–30].
Their generation in this context, along with decreased
induction of tissue-circulating effector memory T cells
(TEM) or secondary lymphoid tissue-circulating central
memory T cells (TCM), could serve as an explanation for
the increased resolution of uninjected non-visceral lesions
compared to visceral lesions.
Another possible explanation for the better response of
uninjected non-visceral lesions may be that these lesions
are simply closer to TVEC-injected lesions compared to
visceral lesions and it may be easier and faster for activated
T cells to migrate to these lesions due to the shorter dis-
tance. An alternative explanation involving distance from
the injection lesion may be that uninjected non-visceral le-
sions are likewise infected during infection of nearby
injected lesions. However, animal studies in which New-
castle Disease Virus was injected into one lesion failed to
detect virus in contralateral lesions within the same tissue
[31]. Further investigation is needed to better understand
how tumors are rejected with talimogene laherparepvec
treatment and the nature and activity of tumor-reactive
T cells need to be more fully defined. Future clinical studies
will examine the impact of direct injection of talimogene
laherparepvec into visceral tumors and this may provide an
opportunity to better understand if local injection can over-
come the more limited visceral lesion response observed
with injection of accessible skin and soft tissue lesions,
which has characterized most oncolytic virus clinical trials
to date. Another strategy in clinical development is to com-
bine oncolytic viruses with other T cell promoting im-
munotherapy agents, most notable T cell and other
immune checkpoint inhibitors. These agents may enhance
the activation status of talimogene laherparepvec-primed
T cell responses and would be expected to increase the
therapeutic activity at both a local and systemic level.
Overall, we observed that in 12 out of 23 patients with
evaluable visceral lesions, only 2 out of 12 patients had
evaluable visceral lesion responses and only 4 out of 32
total evaluable visceral lesions had an objective response.
In the pivotal phase III clinical trial, a higher response
rate was observed in patients with unresectable stage
IIIB/C and IV M1a disease, suggesting this population
may be better suited for treatment with talimogene
laherparepvec. A major limitation of our study was the
relatively small sample size, which may have obscured
the significance of the systemic response elicited by tali-
mogene laherparepvec. An evaluation of lesion responses
in patients treated on the much larger phase III clinical
trial may help resolve this issue [9]. Other limitations of
this study include the need to rely on investigator assess-
ment, different methods of lesion measurement (e.g.
clinical calipers for skin and soft tissue lesions vs. CT-
guided imaging for visceral lesions), lack of immune
response data and time bias since different lesion types
were measured at different time points and immuno-
therapy may result in a delayed kinetics of therapeutic
response. Nonetheless, these data provide some insight
into the mechanism of talimogene laherparepvec activity
and help identify appropriate patients for treatment with
talimogene laherparepvec.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the ability of talimogene laherparepvec to
initiate regional and systemic anti-tumor activity is sup-
ported by responses in both uninjected non-visceral and
some visceral melanoma lesions. The time to lesion re-
sponse was shortest for lesions that were directly injected,
followed by uninjected non-visceral lesions and visceral
lesions, consistent with initiation of a delayed systemic
anti-tumor immune response following talimogene laher-
parepvec treatment. Given the recent FDA approval of tali-
mogene laherparepvec for the treatment of melanoma,
further studies are needed to better understand how tali-
mogene laherparepvec mediates anti-tumor activity. New
studies are planned to evaluate therapeutic responses
through direct injection of visceral tumors and combina-
tions with other T cell enhancing immunotherapy agents.
These studies should provide new insight into the optimal
patient selection for talimogene laherparepvec treatment
and will likely guide further improvements in the thera-
peutic effectiveness of oncolytic viruses as a new class of
