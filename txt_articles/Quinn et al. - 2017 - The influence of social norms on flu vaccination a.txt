Abstract
Adult
influenza
vaccination
rates
remain
suboptimal,
particularly
among
African
Americans. Social norms may influence vaccin-
ation behavior, but little research has focused on
influenza vaccine and almost no research has
focused on racially-specific norms. This mixed
methods investigation utilizes qualitative inter-
views and focus groups (n ¼ 118) and national
survey results (n ¼ 1643) to assess both descrip-
tive and subjective norms surrounding influenza
vaccination. Qualitative results suggest a per-
ceived descriptive norm that ‘about half’ of the
population gets vaccinated. Participants describe
differing norms by race and vaccine behavior.
Quantitative results confirm a perceived descrip-
tive norm that 40–60% of the population gets
vaccinated.
Both
African
Americans
and
Whites accurately identified race-specific vaccin-
ation rates relative to the general population.
Individuals who report that a majority of
people around them want them to be vaccinated
were significantly more likely to be vaccinated,
suggesting subjective norms are influential for
both White
and
African
American
adults.
While perceived descriptive norms are somewhat
accurate (mirroring the actual influenza vac-
cination
rate),
emphasizing
a
suboptimal
vaccination rate may not be beneficial. Health
promotion efforts, particularly those targeting
African Americans, may benefit from focusing
on subjective norms and encouraging friends
and family members to talk about the benefits
of influenza vaccination.
Introduction
Although influenza vaccination is a low-cost pre-
ventive measure that can reduce illness, hospitaliza-
tion and mortality, the majority of American adults
do not get vaccinated. Healthy People 2020 sets a
target objective of 70% uptake for annual immun-
ization against seasonal immunization for adults [1].
During the 2015–16 flu season, only 41.7% of
American adults were immunized for flu [2].
Racial disparities in vaccination rates exacerbate
this problem with only 37% of African American
adults compared to 45% of Whites [2]. Social
norms—which include both perceived and observed
rules, and the customs and practices of others—are
powerful tools to encourage behavior change, but
are understudied when it comes to vaccines in gen-
eral, and flu vaccine, in particular.
Social psychologists posit that group identity is a
major influence on attitudes and behaviors, and that
belonging to a group drives individuals to conform

 to its expected standards [3]. The innate desire by an
individual to fit into the group best explains the
power of social norms while the reciprocal expect-
ation of individuals within the group reinforces its
social norms [3]. Comparisons are made to a refer-
ent group, comprised of people whose expectations
are valuable to the individual, whether family,
friends, neighbors, co-workers or ‘society’ in gen-
eral, it can be further defined by race, ethnicity,
gender, religion, political ideology, sexual orienta-
tion, culture or even shared interests. More simply,
social norms are the acceptable beliefs by people
belonging to a particular group, both explicit and
implicit [3].
Scholars have categorized social norms in various
ways, making replication imprecise, but two cate-
gories have appeared in many studies: descriptive
norms (what others do) and subjective norms (what
others think one should do) [3]. These two types of
norms may be actual or perceived by an individual
[4]. For example, if studies show a majority of col-
lege students average at least 8 h of sleep, that is an
actual descriptive norm; if someone believes the ma-
jority of college students average only 4 h of sleep,
that is a perceived descriptive norm, whether or not
it is accurate.
Norms are used in multiple theoretical frame-
works including the Theory of Reasoned Action
and its extension, the Theory of Planned Behavior,
which posit that intentions are the best predictors of
a behavior and that subjective norms are one of three
major predictors of behavior, along with attitude to-
wards the behavior and perceived behavior control
[5, 6]. The subjective norm is determined by the
normative belief multiplied by the motivation to
comply with what other people expect [7].
Social Norms Theory posits that widely held
misperceptions
between
perceived
and
actual
norms are strongly connected to risky behaviors
[8]. Descriptive norms can explain a person’s per-
ception of the willingness of members of a group to
engage in risk behavior. Injunctive norms can ex-
plain a person’s perception of the approval of mem-
bers of a group to engage in risk behavior [9]. The
Theory of Social Normative Behavior addresses the
failures of norms to highlight the underlying
cognitive mechanisms in the relationship between
descriptive norms and behavioral intentions [10].
The theory posits that three normative mechan-
isms–injunctive norms, outcome expectations and
group identity–affect descriptive norms [10].
Social norms have been used to develop programs
to promote behavior changes. Social norms market-
ing, a system of marketing designed to alter com-
munity perceptions about desirable attitudes and
behaviors, has been applied to reduce gender vio-
lence and sexual violence [11, 12]. Much norms re-
search has focused on understanding risk behaviors
among college students, and social norms marketing
has had some success in reducing these behaviors;
however, evidence suggests that the long-term
effectiveness of these campaigns is quite limited
[13–20]. One area of concern is the ‘boomerang ef-
fect’ where individuals who may be exhibiting
desired behavior, above and beyond the norm,
may move back towards the norm after being
exposed to a norm [21]. Social norms marketing
approaches have been most successful when they
have
identified
appropriate
reference
groups,
ensured that data are credible to target populations
and have followed best practices for basic marketing
principles [21].
Social norms have also been utilized in promoting
vaccination behavior. Several studies of HPV vac-
cination have found that social norms have a signifi-
cant influence on vaccine uptake among female
college students [22, 23] and on parents deciding
to immunize their daughters [24, 25]. Another
study found that social norms messaging increased
Hepatitis B vaccine intentions among men who have
sex with men [26]. Fewer studies have looked at the
influence of norms on influenza vaccination, but evi-
dence suggests that young parents are more likely to
vaccinate their children against seasonal influenza if
they view vaccination to be widespread [27] and a
study of healthcare workers in Europe found that
strong professional norms towards vaccination
were a significant predictor of vaccination [28].
While almost all studies of social norms and vac-
cination account for race as a demographic variable,
we could find no study that specifically asked
respondents about descriptive or subjective norms

 using their own race as the referent group. However,
same-race norms have been shown to be an import-
ant influence on such diverse health issues as drinking
among college students [29], condom use among men
who have sex with men [30] and obesity among
women [31]. We, therefore, hypothesize that same-
race norms may be more important than generalized
norms when it comes to vaccination.
In this article, we highlight our findings on social
norms, developed as part of a larger mixed methods
investigation of racial disparities in influenza vaccin-
ation. First, we conducted formative research using
semi-structured interviews and focus groups with
White and African American adults (n¼ 118), from
which we established several key research questions.
Those findings informed a national survey, con-
ducted in March 2015, of African American and
White adults (n¼ 1643). Throughout the study, we
examined whether social norms seemed to exist
around vaccination, how influential they are and
whether social norms could be harnessed to reduce
vaccine racial disparities. We posed these research
questions, all of which examined racial differences:
Q1: What are the perceived descriptive norms
around flu vaccination?
Q2: What are the perceived subjective norms
related to flu vaccination?
Q3: What influence do perceived social norms
have on flu vaccine behavior?
Materials and methods
Below we describe the methods and findings for
both research phases. All study procedures were re-
viewed and approved by the Institutional Review
Board at the University of Maryland (367080).
Qualitative methods
From 2012–14, we gathered and analysed qualita-
tive data following a Grounded Theory approach,
interspersing three rounds of data collection with
intensive data analysis [32]. Our participants were
from rural, suburban and urban areas of Georgia
and Maryland. They were recruited through a com-
bination of convenience sampling, community en-
gagement with partners and advertisements (see
Quinn et al. 2016, for greater detail) [33]. The over-
all sample (n ¼ 118) included native-born, English-
speaking adults of diverse age, gender and income,
who self-identified as White (n ¼ 39) or African
American (n ¼ 79). Respondents were purposively
selected for variation by vaccine behavior, age,
gender, education and income (Table I). We con-
ducted 12 semi-structured exploratory interviews,
9 focus groups (n ¼ 90) divided variously by race
and vaccine status and 16 in-depth individual inter-
views to explore topics that emerged in focus groups
(Table II). Interviews averaged about 1 h in length
and focus groups averaged about 90min; trained,
same-race moderators led the focus groups.
Questions included attitudes about vaccines and
disease, past experience with the healthcare system,
trust in institutions such as government agencies and
the pharmaceutical industry, cultural and racial
identity and past history of discrimination. Our
intention was to go beyond questions that are trad-
itionally asked in survey research about vaccination
by listening carefully to conversational threads
introduced by participants. For social norms, we
simply asked their impressions of how many
people get vaccinated for flu, who they are and why.
We simultaneously engaged in data collection,
analysis and theory development throughout the
course of the project [32]. All interviews and
focus
groups
were
professionally
transcribed
and imported into Atlas.ti Qualitative Analysis
Software. Using two team members who coded in-
dependently, we examined our data through empir-
ically-based, inductive and deductive analysis,
including coding, memo writing and theory building
[32]. After identifying 121 codes, a second round of
broad-brush coding identified larger themes, which
were summarized in memos around major concepts,
including illustrative quotes from the transcript.
Some of the major themes included trust in the flu
vaccine, trust in the process and agencies that pro-
duce the vaccine, balancing perceived disease risk
against perceived risk of vaccine side effects, the
influence of social norms, the use of ‘natural’

 remedies, the role of history in shaping attitudes and
also the role of conspiracy theories related to vac-
cines [33]. Our research continues to move towards
incorporating these themes into an overarching
theory of flu vaccine hesitancy and acceptance, but
this manuscript will be focused exclusively on our
findings related to social norms.
Qualitative results
Our initial probes explored whether clear descriptive
social norms existed for flu vaccination. When asked
about their perceptions of whether others in the com-
munity were getting flu vaccines, many participants
reported little awareness of social norms, ‘It’s not
something we really talk about, no’ (WFT) [Coding
to identify quotes: (W) White, (AA) African
American, (F) Female, (M) Male, (T) Vaccine
Taker, (NT) Vaccine Non-Taker]. Some people
related this to the flu vaccine’s success, because
when it works, people do not get sick and its
impact is unrecognized, ‘Generally, people don’t
tell you when they don’t catch it’ (AAM). Some
people noted a lack of advertisements and media
coverage: ‘There haven’t been any signs saying
‘There’s an outbreak!’ or ‘Go get the flu vaccine.’
It’s not advertised at all’ (WFT).
Our first objective was to determine whether clear
descriptive or subjective norms existed. When asked
how many people get the flu vaccine, many respond-
ents answered, ‘50–50’. For some, this reflected a
belief that the population is polarized:
And then I would say it’s pretty 50/50, people
have pretty strong feelings about it. Either
they get it like clockwork every year or they’re
very against it (WFT).
I think it’s 50/50. I think that some people are
all for it. They got to get it every year because
they just swear by it. And then others are like,

 ‘Well, I’ve never gotten one. So I’m just going
to chance it (WFNT).
For others, it’s simply a guess:
I would say it’s probably half and half
(AAFNT).
I’m making this up, 50%. I don’t know .. .
Because some people have real fears about
getting it and other people don’t have fears,
and 50% is half of them fears and half– I
mean I know there is stuff out there that
would keep people from getting it, and the
stuff I don’t believe to be true and other
people do believe it’s true (WMT).
I have no idea. I’m guessing half. I don’t know
(WMNT).
I would put it at less than 50 is my guess, but
I’ve never heard anything, so I’m really just
guessing, but I’m just thinking that there have
got to be a whole lot of people who–I mean I
know there are a lot of people who don’t go to
the doctor regularly until its emergency time. I
mean we hear about that on the news all the
time. So there is a good chance that they are
not getting the flu vaccine (WMNT).
Individuals let their own vaccine behavior influence
their attitudes about others. For instance, vaccine
takers were more likely to see other vaccine takers
as more health conscious and considerate:
They take care of themselves first, they take
care because a lot of us have grandchildren
and a lot of neighbors with children or other
people who are older. And I don’t know, it’s
just a sense of you’re doing a right thing by
not contributing to more flu going around
(WFT).
I think they’re [vaccine takers] just more pre-
vention, I think they’re more conscious. As I
see myself, as not wanting to either get it or
spread it, so if there is a way that we can do
that we’ll take that option (AAFT).
They viewed non-takers negatively, as indifferent,
lazy and uncaring:
The two people I don’t think would get the
vaccine are mostly because they are not
really interested in seeking things out. I
think if a doctor showed up at their door
with a needle they would probably get a flu
shot, but I don’t think that they would be very
proactive, and they’re not proactive about
anything really, like social life or health
stuff (WFT).
In contrast, non-takers tended to view fellow non-
takers as having made a rational decision to not
vaccinate.
[Non-takers are] Probably people that need to
spend that money on other things, people that
just aren’t too, I guess people like me that I
doubt I’m going to get the flu anyways, so I
don’t want to mess with it, people that are
more philosophically opposed to pharmaceut-
icals and that sort of thing, which I doubt is a
lot of people, but occasionally I’m sure,
people for whom it’s just not an issue for
whatever reason (WMNT).
Non-takers viewed vaccine takers as different from
themselves, identifying several characteristics that
set them apart including greater risk for disease
due to sickness or old age, having health insurance
and/or easy access to healthcare or needing a flu
vaccine as part of a work requirement:
I think older people are more likely to, pro-
vided they have access. I think they are
strongly encouraged to (WMNT).
Like I said, when you go into CVS or Rite Aid
it’s there, especially with the elderly, I think
the elderly population probably do (AAFNT).
My guess is they are much more likely to have
health insurance and regular visits to their
physician for health, a physical, a checkup
maybe once a year or close to once a year,
that are attentive to that, and people that are
older
will
be
more
focused
on
health
(WMNT).
Maybe a couple of elderly people, and prob-
ably some of my age range or young adults
S. C. Quinn et al.

 would have gotten it, because a lot of them
also work in the medical field or are police
officers and stuff like that (AAFNT).
Others are less positive, as some non-takers view
vaccine takers as being more easily influenced by
‘experts’:
Probably, I mean people that want to put more
faith in experts as kind of a way of achieving
truth and enlightenment, people that have
gotten the flu really badly before, or people
that have a history of other people in their
family
being
really
serious
about
that,
people that do have other chronic illnesses
that the flu would sort of enhance. Those
would be my guesses. (WMNT).
However, both takers and non-takers recognized
that mistrust was a significant influence for non-vac-
cine-takers, particularly among African Americans:
I think there are people who doubt that the
vaccine works. I think that there are a
number of people who have trust issues. I
think some don’t do it because of cost, because
everybody thinks it’s not going to be them, ‘I
won’t get it. I haven’t gotten it yet.’ That’s
what I would go with. (AAFNT).
I hadn’t thought about that, why some do and
some don’t. I mean clearly it’s the trust factor
again. I think it’s some that are stuck on– oh,
you’re going to make me say it again– their
awareness of the Tuskegee study (AAMNT).
I do think African Americans have a different
attitude about getting healthcare and getting
vaccines than others (AAMNT).
Participants were asked to describe the role of
friends and family in shaping vaccination norms.
Nearly everyone, white and black, takers and non-
takers, described family as an important influence on
their vaccine decisions. In fact, family was second
only to personal physicians as the most trusted
source of information related to vaccines.
Mod: Whose information would you trust the
most?
A: Besides the doctor’s?
Mod: Yeah.
A: My mom’s.
Mod: Can you tell me why?
A: She’s very wise. She knows a lot of things
that I don’t know. And it’s your mom, you
know. (WFT).
Mod: So it doesn’t matter where the message,
whether it comes from the government or it
comes from the news media, it’s no different to
you?
S: The most important person is parents,
family, and friends. That’s it.
Mod: The people that you know.
S: That’s right. If they’re doing it then I’m
more likely to do it (WMNT).
However, a subset of older participants made their
decision independent from their family.
And what my friends and family do, that
doesn’t influence me. It’s what I’m going to
do and I’m kind of at an age now where it’s
like I don’t care what you do, this is what I’m
doing, this is what is best for me, so I really
don’t let that influence me that much (WFNT).
And in terms of what family and friends do, for
the most part I tend not to be swayed by, par-
ticularly if I have–I will say if I have a strong
feeling about something or just not in a cat-
egory of undecided about something then
what friends and family say won’t weigh too
heavily (AAFNT).
Most participants described a kind of ‘family cul-
ture’ surrounding vaccination that was shaped by
their childhood experiences and continued to influ-
ence their decisions as adults. There were clear dif-
ferences between vaccine takers and vaccine non-
takers and differences by race. Family practices
could encourage vaccination:
So, maybe that’s why I’m so used to it. And
growing up with my dad being a physician, it
was always prioritized that we should get the
vaccinations because he always said it was
good and we shouldn’t–he has his MPH, too,

 so it’s like very much–so does my sister–it’s
very much like promoted in our family (WFT).
Again I did grow up with understanding the
importance of vaccines. So, that influenced,
and my folks being, my dad is a doctor, my
mom is a nurse, it wasn’t so much discussion
of vaccines, but I understood (AAMT).
They could also discourage vaccination:
I grew up with my mother, grandmother,
father,
great-grandmother,
everybody
around me, ‘No, I’m not taking that. It ain’t
gonna give me the flu.’ I mean, that’s always
what I’ve heard, so when I became an adult,
‘Well no, not going to give me the flu either.’
So huh-uh, don’t do it (AAFNT)
Mod: So you feel like this was something that
was part of the family’s behavior?
F: Oh yeah, we’ve never voluntarily gotten a
shot, none of us, none of the family at all for as
long as I can remember (AAFNT).
Any kind of flu, we just never got it vaccinated,
which is interesting because it’s probably one
of those things that passes down. You’re going
to ask, like who do you ask? Well, the first
person you’re going to ask is probably not
your doctor; you’re going to ask your parents,
you’re going to ask your grandparents
(WMNT).
African Americans were more likely to describe an
active debate over vaccination. Both vaccine takers
and non-takers could point to friends or family
members that held an opposing view on vaccination.
The idea of a ‘family divided’ was quite common in
both focus groups and interviews.
Mod: And what is your family talking about?
What are they saying about getting the
vaccine?
M: Very divided, my family.
Mod: Very divided. Tell me about that division.
M: Pretty much half is for and the other half is
against. And the younger side is more for. The
older side is more against (AAMNT).
In African American families in particular, there
was a significant push back against ‘selling out’ or
becoming a ‘guinea pig.’ There were also significant
debates over the severity and likelihood of side
effects:
I can only go by what I’ve seen people that
actually have gotten the shot and what hap-
pens to them. Other than that I don’t actually
know, because I haven’t taken it, but just to
see most of them when they get it they get sick,
it deters me from taking it. So I haven’t even
tried even going about it (AAFNT).
A few [friends] that would begin to question
me, ‘Have you researched this? We don’t
know what’s coming down the pipe with it
(AAFNT).
White participants were less likely to describe dis-
cussion among their families, instead describing
families quietly supportive of vaccination, or
families that were ambivalent but didn’t engage in
a debate.
I think I may actually have talked to my mom
briefly about it before, like ‘Oh I got the flu
shot this week’ and she will say, ‘Oh yeah, I
got mine last month.’ And that is the end of the
conversation. So I think that she gets it, but we
don’t really go into depth (WFT).
The exception was among a small group of non-
takers with no family history with flu vaccination.
I mean no one in my family gets vaccinated for
the flu. I asked my mom about it. She says she
doesn’t see a real benefit in getting vaccinated
for the flu. I don’t know if anyone in my family
has ever had the flu. I mean I’m sure they’ve
had the flu, but I can’t think of actually anyone
in my family who has ever been vaccinated,
but this year I did go to the doctor’s office to at
least talk about it for the first time, just be-
cause I had heard it’s probably a good idea
(WMNT).
Among our participants, family culture proved to be
a strong and lasting influence on social norms

 surrounding vaccination but racial differences were
evident in their discussion.
Quantitative methods
In 2015, we contracted with GfK to conduct a na-
tionally representative online survey with a target
sample of 800 U.S. Black and 800 White adults
over age 18 selected from GfK’s Knowledge
Panel, a probability-based web panel that utilizes
an Addressed Based Sampling methodology to cap-
ture a representative sample of the U.S. For Whites,
839 completed the survey for a rate of 63.1%. For
African Americans, 819 completed the survey for a
completion rate of 51.2%. Of the 1657 respondents
who completed the survey, 1643 were determined to
be valid and included in the final analysis (See Table
II for sample description). GfK provided sample
weights for both Black and White samples utilizing
benchmarks from the 2014 Current Population
Survey, such as gender by age, census region, metro-
politan status, education level, household income
and internet access. The survey consisted of both
standard vaccine-related items as well as novel
items developed in response to our qualitative find-
ings (see Quinn et al., 2017 for full measures) [34].
The survey was also pre-tested, utilizing 16 cogni-
tive interviews with volunteers who explained their
thought-processes as they went through each item so
we could ensure the reliability and validity of our
novel measures [35].
The constructs of perceived descriptive norms
and perceived subjective norms were both measured
with single questions. The perceived descriptive
norms variable was assessed with two different ref-
erent groups. The first used the entire U.S. popula-
tion as a referent group asking, ‘Thinking about
people in the U.S., how many of them do you
think get a flu vaccine each year?’ and the second
used the respondent’s own racial group as a referent
group asking, ‘Thinking about people of your own
race, how many of them do you think get a flu vac-
cine each year?’ The subjective norms question
asked, ‘Of the people close to you, what proportion
want you to get a flu vaccine?’ All three items were
answered on a 5-point scale ranging from ‘few
(0–20%)’ to ‘most or nearly all (81–100%).’ The
vaccine behavior question asked, ‘Did you get a
flu vaccine this season?,’ which was coded either
no or yes (0 and 1), respectively. The relations
among social norms variables, vaccination and
race were assessed using contingency tables and
chi-square tests of independence to determine
whether the variables appeared to be statistically
associated. All analyses were weighted by the
post-stratification weights such that the results
were nationally representative.
Quantitative results
Research questions 1 and 2 focused on describing
perceived descriptive and subjective norms, includ-
ing racial differences (Table III). Overall, the largest
proportion of respondents (43%) answered that be-
tween 40% and 60% of Americans get a flu vaccin-
ation, and the second largest group (35%) believed

 that between 20% and 40% of people get flu vaccin-
ations. On the extreme ends, about 6% believed that
fewer than 20% of Americans get a flu vaccine, and
about 2% believed that most people get vaccinated.
For the subjective norm, ‘how many of the people
close to them would want them to get a flu vaccin-
ation’, most respondents fell into the extreme ends:
about 36% felt that fewer than 20% of the people
close to them would want them to get a flu vaccin-
ation, whereas about 26% felt that more than 80% of
people close to them would care. In the middle,
about 13% felt that slightly less than half of their
close loved ones would care, 16% guessed that be-
tween 40 and 60% would and about 12% said some-
what more than half would want them to get the flu
vaccine.
There were significant racial differences for both
descriptive norms and the subjective norm. For the
general population norm, African Americans per-
ceived more people getting vaccinated overall than
Whites did (P < 0.001); however, both groups over-
estimated vaccination rates for the general popula-
tion. For the race specific descriptive norm, 51.9%
of African Americans correctly perceived that fewer
African Americans were vaccinated, and Whites
correctly perceived that more Whites were vacci-
nated (P < 0.001). Whites perceived a stronger sub-
jective norm for vaccination than did African
Americans (P < 0.001).
In Table IV, we see that regardless of race, adults
who got flu vaccine this season perceived higher
levels of vaccination evidenced in their descriptive
norms than those who did not get the flu vaccine. For
those who perceived half of the U.S. population
got vaccinated, Whites were more likely to get
vaccinated than African Americans. For African
Americans, the chi-square test shows that there
was no statistically significant association between
perceived descriptive norms and vaccine behavior.

 population. Whites who got the flu vaccine were
associated with perceiving higher racially-specific
descriptive norms. For African Americans, the ra-
cially-specific descriptive norm and vaccine behav-
ior were not statistically associated.
The racial differences between the subjective
norms and flu vaccine behavior are shown in
Fig. 1. About 49% of our respondents had already
received a flu vaccination, and about 51% had not.
For both African Americans and Whites, getting a
flu vaccine was positively associated with the per-
ception that more family and friends wanted them to
be vaccinated. This was statistically significant for
both groups.
Discussion
Our first research question examined the existence
of perceived descriptive norms for both racial
groups. Our qualitative research on perceived
norms around flu vaccination indicate respondents
believe about half of the population receives a flu
vaccine while the other half does not. Our quantita-
tive findings also support this perception, with the
largest proportion of survey respondents indicating
that between 40% and 60% of the general popula-
tion gets vaccinated. While these estimates reflect
the actual descriptive norm of about 42%, our re-
search suggests that rather than an informed esti-
mate, it appears this ‘50–50’ response represents
little more than a guess for most people. Flu vaccin-
ation may be the topic of private conversation with
friends, family and co-workers, but is infrequently
discussed in wider society, and therefore people do
not have any basis for knowledge about the general
vaccination rate. Further, most promotion of flu vac-
cination simply encourages flu vaccination without
describing the actual rates of uptake. Often, in inter-
views, when people reasoned aloud about norms,
they based their ideas about frequency of flu vaccine
on other factors, such as people’s tendency to avoid
medical care. Participants were also not especially
confident about their guesses. Because this descrip-
tive norm is not definitive in terms of vaccination
behavior, it is not likely to exert social pressure or
influence on people in either direction–vaccination
or non-vaccination. From the perspective of Social
Norms Theory, the misconception between actual

 norms and perceived norms would typically be seen
as an opportunity to correct the misconception and
change behavior. Current influenza vaccination
rates are not ideal, and yet respondents are actually
overestimating vaccine uptake. However, from a
public health viewpoint, there is a risk that empha-
sizing this perceived norm based on mediocre vac-
cination rates, may normalize non-vaccination and
could trigger the ‘boomerang effect’ where some
vaccinators may realize they are already exceeding
the norm.
We also explored the role of different referent
groups in shaping descriptive norms. While our ini-
tial item asked about the general population without
specifying further, both groups appear to have an-
swered the question in ways that suggest they were
mirroring their own group’s actual vaccination rates.
In survey results, we see this in the ways both White
and African American respondents could accurately
differentiate their own racial group’s vaccination
rates when compared to the national average. In
our qualitative research, many African American
respondents
introduced
racially-specific
factors
that influenced their vaccination decisions, particu-
larly the history of African Americans’ distrust of
medical care.
We were also interested in understanding the role
of subjective norms for both groups. While the sub-
jective norm appeared to be more influential in shap-
ing vaccine behavior among African Americans in
the qualitative research, survey results found sub-
jective norms to be a significant influence on both
White and African American vaccine behavior.
Over 60% of Whites and 50% of African
Americans who did not get vaccinated reported
that few people close to them wanted them to
get
the
vaccine.
Conversely,
over
40%
of
Whites and over 30% of African Americans who
took the vaccine reported that most or nearly all
wanted them to get the vaccine (Fig. 1). This
speaks to the dramatic impact of subjective
norms on vaccine behavior.
Similarly, in our qualitative work, many spoke of
an importance of a family culture around vaccin-
ation. From the perspective of the Theory of
Planned Behavior, health communicators may
wish to focus on increasing perceived subjective
norms within the African American group as a
way to increase intention and actual vaccine
uptake, thereby decreasing the disparity between
the two groups. Several approaches may be effective
in doing so: focusing on changing the family culture
around vaccination by emphasizing family needs
and expectations, particularly in families where
members experience chronic diseases that put
them at higher risk of complications from influenza,
and secondly, seizing opportunities to reach African
American families through family reunions, other
holiday gatherings and trusted venues, such as
barber/beauty shops or faith communities, with mes-
sages that encourage conversations with loved ones
about the importance of flu vaccinations.
While the Theory of Social Normative Behavior
suggests that group identity affects descriptive
norms, and we see some consistency between
racial group and norms, a central tenet of our re-
search approach has been to recognize that African
Americans are not a monolithic group. Therefore,
we encourage future research to explore differences
within the African American group to determine
characteristics in addition to race that may contrib-
ute to the influence of descriptive and subjective
norms. The influence of subjective norms in any
group–including
African
Americans–may
vary
with age, education, geography, health status or
other characteristics.
Conclusions
Perceived descriptive norms about flu vaccination
are weak, but realistic, reflecting the reality that
just under half of all adults receive a flu vaccination,
with even lower uptake among African Americans.
More importantly, we identified a greater associ-
ation between subjective norms and vaccination be-
havior, extending across both races. This finding
suggests that increasing communication among
loved ones about flu vaccine may be an effective
tactic to increase flu vaccination.
