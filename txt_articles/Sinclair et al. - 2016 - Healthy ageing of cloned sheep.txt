The health of cloned animals generated by somatic-cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) has been of
concern since its inception; however, there are no detailed assessments of late-onset,
non-communicable diseases. Here we report that SCNT has no obvious detrimental long-
term health effects in a cohort of 13 cloned sheep. We perform musculoskeletal assessments,
metabolic tests and blood pressure measurements in 13 aged (7–9 years old) cloned sheep,
including four derived from the cell line that gave rise to Dolly. We also perform radiological
examinations of all main joints, including the knees, the joint most affected by osteoarthritis
in Dolly, and compare all health parameters to groups of 5- and 6-year-old sheep, and
published reference ranges. Despite their advanced age, these clones are euglycaemic, insulin
sensitive and normotensive. Importantly, we observe no clinical signs of degenerative joint
disease apart from mild, or in one case moderate, osteoarthritis in some animals. Our study is
the first to assess the long-term health outcomes of SCNT in large animals.

 T
he 20th anniversary of the birth of the first animal (‘Dolly’)
to be derived from adult cells1, celebrated in July 2016,
marks a milestone in the progress of somatic-cell nuclear
transfer (SCNT), which has since been undertaken in more than
20 mammalian species including, quite recently, work involving
human cells2–4. The pioneering study of Wilmut et al.1 was
significant, however, because it demonstrated the potential to
induce pluripotency in terminally differentiated cells. Indeed,
although alternative approaches now exist for the generation of
pluripotent stem cells5, it is generally recognized that SCNT
remains the most effective way to reprogram somatic cells to a
pluripotent state6,7. Nevertheless, despite technological advances
in recent years8 efficiency of SCNT remains low. This is best
exemplified
by
the
well-documented
losses
of
partially
reprogrammed embryos occurring throughout gestation and
immediately
following
birth9–12.
Although
detailed
clinical
studies are lacking, the general consensus is that cloned
offspring that survive beyond the neonatal period are healthy
and reproductively fit13–17; although in some studies cloned mice
tended to be obese, hyperinsulinaemic18 and were shorter lived19.
Longevity and healthy ageing among SCNT clones have been
contentious issues from the outset20,21, with much made of the
fact that Dolly had been undergoing treatment for osteoarthritis
(OA) for some time before her death in 2003, aged 6½ years22–24.
However, to the best of our knowledge, no formal, comprehensive
assessment
has
been
conducted
of
age-related,
non-
communicable diseases such as metabolic syndrome, hyper-
tension and OA (three major comorbidities in aged human
populations25) in cloned offspring of any species. This is
significant because it is now well established that relatively
subtle alterations to the periconceptional environment, either
during natural mating or following assisted reproduction, can
lead
to
heritable
alterations
to
the
epigenome
linked
to
subsequent development and late-onset chronic diseases26–29.
Given that SCNT requires the use of assisted reproductive
procedures
to
generate
donor
oocytes
and
to
culture
reconstructed zygotes to the point of transfer, it is important to
establish whether similar comorbidities exist in apparently
healthy aged cloned offspring, using a long-lived and precocial
mammalian species.
To this end we recently undertook detailed assessments of
glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, ambulatory- and stimulated-
blood pressure, together with musculoskeletal investigations,
including clinical and radiological examination of all main joints,
in 13 cloned sheep aged between 7 and 9 years (natural lifespan
typically o10 years). In addition, magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) was undertaken of the stifle joints (the joint between the
femur and tibia). These animals originated from studies under-
taken between 2005 and 2007 that sought to improve the
efficiency of SCNT by addressing issues related to mitochondrial
heteroplasmy and chromatin remodelling at the point of nuclear
transfer. Pregnancy outcomes for some of the clones derived from
primary fetal fibroblasts were reported previously30,31. In addition
to reporting the health status of aged clones derived from those
studies we also report on the health of four 8-year-old Finn-
Dorset clones (Fig. 1) derived from the mammary gland cell line
that gave rise to Dolly1. That is they are clones (genomic copies)
of Dolly. Reference is made to the health status of contemporary
groups of 5-and 6-year-old sheep, and published values for
specific
health-related
parameters
in
sheep.
Despite
their
advanced age, the clones were found to be euglycaemic, insulin
sensitive and normotensive. Although most showed radiographic
evidence of mild osteoathritis in one or two joints, no animal was
lame and none have required treatment. We could find no
evidence, therefore, of a detrimental long-term effect of cloning
by SCNT on the health of aged offspring among our cohort.
Results
Origin and genetic identity of cloned offspring. Microsatellite
analyses confirmed that sheep within each clonal group were
genetically identical to their respective parental-donor cell line
for all 21 markers (Supplementary Table 1). The oldest clone
(A089; male) was born in July 2006 and was derived from the
primary fetal-fibroblast cell line SFF1 (Supplementary Table 1) as
reported previously31. As part of that study the donor cell that gave
rise to A089 had undergone mtDNA depletion before NT. Six of
the female Lleyn clones were born in June 2008 and were derived
from the primary fetal-fibroblast cell line LFF4 as reported
previously30. Four of these clones (that is, 382, 385, 386 and 387)
were derived from permeabilized fetal fibroblasts incubated with
Xenopus oocyte extract with a view to enhancing epigenetic
remodelling
of
chromatin
before
NT.
The
remaining
two
clones (that is, 388 and 389) were derived from permeabilized
fibroblasts that were not exposed to extract. A seventh female
Lleyn clone (2265) was also derived from LFF4 cells but was born
in the previous year (August 2007) along with clone 2264
(derived from fetal-fibroblast cell line SFF5, breed unknown).
These two clones formed part of a pilot study designed to assess
the suitability of these two cell lines for SCNT using standard
in-house protocols30,31.
The four female Finn-Dorset clones (2260, 2261, 2262 and
2263; Fig. 1) were born in July 2007. Data from these animals have
not been reported previously. They were derived from the mammary
gland cell line that gave rise to Dolly1 (Supplementary Table 1).
The study that produced these four ewes (Supplementary Table 6)
was an extension of that of Choi et al32. which used fetal fibroblasts
as nuclear donors. Both studies investigated the effects of treating
ovine oocytes during the latter stages of in vitro maturation,
before nuclear transfer, with caffeine. We now report that 10 lambs
derived from these nuclear donor cells were born (derived from
seven caffeine-treated and three control oocytes), seven lived
beyond 1 week of age (derived from five caffeine-treated and
two control oocytes), but only four survived to adulthood (all derived
from caffeine treated oocytes).

energy ¼ 11.0 MJ kg � 1 DM; crude protein ¼ 130 g kg � 1 DM)
ad libitum (equivalent to B2 � maintenance33)) for a 28-week
period to attain a body condition score (BCS) of 4.0 units (1[thin]
to 5[obese] scale34), equivalent to B40% total body fat35 for female
sheep. This was in line with our reference population of 6-year-
old females conceived by embryo transfer (ET-controls). Mean

 (±s.e.m.) BCS of 4.0±0.1 and 4.1±0.2 units were attained for
Lleyn and Finn-Dorset clones at the time of body composition
assessment by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Body
condition scores for clones 2264, 2265 and A089 at this time were

fed the same diet ad libitum for an extended period (28 weeks),
and BCS were similar. This probably reflects differences in body
fat (that is, subcutaneous versus intra-abdominal fat) distribution

Figure 2 | Body fat, glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in aged cloned sheep and contemporary embryo transfer (ET) controls. Percentage body
fat (determined by DEXA) revealed differences between clonal groups (n ¼ 11 ET-Controls, 6 Lleyn and 4 FD clones) (a). Finn-Dorset (FD) clones were
subsequently placed on a diet to reduce body fat percentage from 46% (FD46) to 36% (FD36). Initial glucose tolerance tests revealed modest differences
in glucose tolerance (b) and large differences in insulinaemia (c) between clonal groups that probably reflected genotype differences in body fat percentage
and body fat distribution. Insulin sensitivity did not differ between clonal groups and ET-controls (d). Although glucose tolerance was unaltered (e),
insulinaemia was significantly reduced when Finn-Dorset clones lost body fat (f). Glucose was infused i.v. at 0.4 g � kg � 1 body weight and insulin at

 between genotypes36. Corresponding levels of body fat for clones
2264, 2265 (both female) and A089 (male) were 42%, 38% and
23%, respectively (Supplementary Table 2).
Non-fasted plasma glucose concentrations at the onset of the
initial glucose tolerance test (GTT), 4 h after the morning meal,
were all within the normal fasting range for well-fed sheep
of moderate body condition (3.25 to 4.50 mmol/L (ref. 37)). The
lower (ANOVA; Po0.001; SED ¼ 0.24) glucose concentrations
(mmol/L) found in ET-Controls (3.20) than in either Finn-Dorset
(3.70) or Lleyn (4.20) clones (Fig. 2b) are therefore of no clinical
significance. The Finn-Dorset and Lleyn clones, nevertheless,
appeared less tolerant to glucose infusion (400 mg kg � 1) than the
ET-Controls, as evident from the incremental area under the
curve (Fig. 2b). Resting plasma insulin (mIU ml � 1) was also
greater (ANOVA; Po0.001) for the Finn-Dorset clones (81.5)
than for either the Lleyn clones (34.1) or ET-controls (15.7) at the
onset of the initial GTT, and a hyperinsulinaemic state was
confirmed in these animals following glucose infusion (Fig. 2c).
Compared with fasted basal plasma insulin concentrations in lean
and obese sheep from previous studies (Supplementary Table 3),
these values for the Finn-Dorset clones appear high. However,
neither percentage decline in plasma glucose per minute
following insulin administration (0.75 IU kg � 1) (K4–16), nor the
half-time for glucose clearance t(1/2), differed between these
animal groups (Fig. 2d), indicating that peripheral tissue insulin
sensitivity was similar. To get a better sense of the contribution of
body fat to insulin sensitivity, the four Finn-Dorset ewes
were
subsequently
placed
on
an
energy-restricted
diet
(0.7 � maintenance (ref. 33)) for 20 weeks during which time
their level of body fat declined from B46 to B36% (Fig. 2a).
Although glucose tolerance was not altered (Fig. 2e), both resting
(29 mIU ml � 1) and glucose-stimulated plasma insulin concentra-
tions were markedly reduced (ANOVA; Po0.05) in the leaner
Finn-Dorset clones (Fig. 2f), indicating that a major factor
contributing to hyperinsulinaemia in these animals was level of
body fat.
Corresponding non-fasting plasma glucose concentrations for
the other three clones were close to or slightly above the normal
fasting range (Supplementary Table 2). At B38% body fat, the
8-year-old clone 2265 was fatter than her 7-year-old fellow Lleyn
clones, but otherwise her indices of glucose and insulin tolerance
were similar. The 9-year-old male clone was also euglycaemic,
with glucose indices similar to that of ET-control males during
the GTT. Although glucose tolerance was normal for this animal,
insulin secretion (DMax) was low and peripheral tissue insulin
sensitivity (that is, K4–16 and half-life) was reduced relative to
ET-Control males of similar body composition. Parameters for
this animal, however, do not indicate a diabetic state.
Ambulatory and stimulated blood pressure. After recovery from
telemeter implantation, resting blood pressure and heart rate were
monitored over the next 4 days. No sheep exhibited any clear
circadian rhythm of pressure (for example, nocturnal dipping
analysed by non-linear regression using Fourier curves). Hence,
Fig. 3 reports a composite pressure trace recorded over 4 days in
which sheep were group-housed and exposed only to routine
husbandry procedures. Mean arterial (MAP) and diastolic (DBP)
blood pressure over the study period were similar among clones
(MAP, 111±7 versus 102±8 mm Hg, P ¼ 0.18; DBP, 96±6
versus 90±7 mm Hg, ANOVA; P ¼ 0.24; Finn-Dorset versus
Lleyns, respectively) and when compared with ET-controls
(MAP, 114±6: DBP, 106±7 mm Hg). Systolic blood pressure
was similar between clones and to ET-controls (Fig. 3a,b), but
resting heart rate in ET-controls was lower (average HR, 76±8
versus 91±11 (Finn-Dorset) and 92±6 (Lleyns) beats per min;
ANOVA; Po0.001, Fig. 2c,d). Spikes in pressure and heart rate
were noted in all sheep at morning feed time (B08:00 hours,
Fig. 3a,c). Cardiovascular parameters recorded in the elderly
clones were within the established normal range of pressures
reported for aged sheep in the literature (Supplementary Table 4).
The pressor response to incremental Angiotensin II (Ang II) was
chosen as a cardiovascular challenge, as comparison with data
from ET-controls and other studies conducted by us in
sheep38 were available for reference. Also, Ang II is a potent
vasoconstrictor, often targeted as a cardiovascular therapy
through the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.
Step-wise (every 10 min) doubling of intravenous (i.v.) Ang II
delivery incrementally increased BP in all sheep (Fig. 3e,f), the
effect size being identical between clones (Finn-Dorset, 62±12
versus
Lleyn,
62±12 mm Hg)
and
similar
to
ET-controls
(58±10 mm Hg). Heart rate tended to decrease with increasing
Ang II infusion in Lleyn clones, but was refractory to the
depressor effect of high blood pressure in Finn-Dorset clones
(Fig. 3g), which was in keeping with the ET-controls (Fig. 3h).
Musculoskeletal assessments. Only two cloned sheep were
identified as having an abnormal gait on clinical examination,
scoring 1 and 2 on the six-point scale of Kaler et al39.
(Supplementary Table 5). However no animal showed obvious
signs of pain on manipulation of any joint. Radiographic
assessment revealed that most sheep had either normal hip
joints or mild grade 1 osteophytosis (Fig. 4). The only sheep with
significant degenerative joint disease was the Finn-Dorset clone
2262, with moderate to severe osteophytosis (scoring 2–3 on the
modified scale of Kellgren and Lawrence40) of the majority of
joints (Figs 5 and 6a). MRI of the stifles demonstrated the
degenerative
changes
apparent
in
the
radiographs,
with
periarticular osteophytosis primarily on the trochlear ridges and
caudal tibia (Fig. 6b,c). The severity of the changes was greatest in
clone 2262. In addition, clones 2262 and 2263 had evidence of
mild bilateral synovitis, while clones 2260 and 2261 had mild
bilateral synovial effusions.
Discussion
This study represents the first detailed and comprehensive
assessment of age-related, non-communicable diseases in adult
cloned offspring of large animals. Working with sheep, four of
which were cloned from the cell line that gave rise to Dolly, we
undertook assessments of metabolic, cardiovascular and muscu-
loskeletal
health.
Importantly,
despite
their
advanced
age
(7–9 years), none of the clones showed any clinical signs of
disease, being euglycaemic, insulin sensitive and normotensive.
No animal was lame despite most showing radiographic evidence
of mild OA in one or two joints, as would be expected in sheep of
that age. None have required treatment for OA. In the absence of
perfectly matched (by age, genotype and environment), naturally
conceived controls, these conclusions were reached with reference
to (a) a contemporary group of six-year-old sheep that were
managed alongside the clones, and underwent the same metabolic
and cardiovascular assessments, (b) published reference ranges
for blood glucose, (c) pelvic radiographs of eight 5-year-old
healthy sheep, and (d) the available scientific literature. Whilst
contemporaneous controls would have been ideal, our data are
nevertheless compelling, indicating no detrimental long-term
adverse effects of SCNT on the health of aged adult offspring.
Because cloning by SCNT can lead to obesity and hyperinsu-
linaemia in aged mice18, and a single case of Type I (insulin
dependent) diabetes was reported in a cloned calf41, we decided to
measure glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in our aged
cloned offspring. There are (infrequent) reports of naturally

 occurring type I diabetes in sheep42, where glucose concen-
trations for affected animals range between 16 to 19 mmol l � 1.
However, we are unaware of cases of type II (non-insulin
dependent)
diabetes,
although
insulin
resistance
has
been
extensively studied in this species43 where it is known, for
example, that deficiencies in maternal periconceptional diet can
lead to insulin resistance in adult offspring44. In humans, risk
factors for insulin resistance leading to type II diabetes include
advanced age and obesity; the latter risk factor is also related to
enhanced insulin resistance in sheep43,45. Hence the current study
sought to create an obese state in our experimental animals to
fully test the extent of glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity46.
Hyperinsulinaemia in the four Finn-Dorset clones (Fig. 2c) was
certainly influenced by the level of body fat, as weight loss
reduced plasma insulin concentrations (Fig. 2f), consistent with
improved peripheral insulin sensitivity which can be expected
following weight loss in sheep46. However, peripheral insulin
sensitivity is negatively related to visceral fat and intrahepatic
lipid accumulation in humans47,48, which varies between ethnic
groups49. It follows that genotype differences in regional fat
distribution in sheep36 may at least partially account for the large
difference
in
insulin
response

infusion
observed between Finn-Dorset clones and ET-controls, which
had a similar proportion of total body fat (Fig. 2a). Although this
awaits final confirmation following post-mortem examination,
previous studies indicate that the Finn-Dorset genotype has larger

Consistent with observations for cloned offspring from other
species9,14,52,
perinatal
losses
of
cloned
sheep
have
been
associated with structural defects of the kidneys and heart, and
with
pulmonary
hypertension10.
Enlarged
and
abnormally
developed kidneys were also evident in some of the six live-
born Finn-Dorset clones that failed to survive to 3 months of age
in the current study (Supplementary Table 6). We hypothesized
that if subtle renal defects in surviving offspring were to persist
late into adult life then this could lead to increased blood
pressure, known as reno-vascular hypertension53. Hypertension
has been described to ‘follow-the-kidney’ in cross-transplantation
studies, suggesting factors intrinsic to the kidney mediate
increases
in
blood
pressure54–56.
The
renin–angiotensin–
aldosterone system is a major target for long-term anti-
hypertensive
treatment
as
elevated
intra-renal
renin–
angiotensin–aldosterone system action and/or sensitivity may
directly cause increased blood pressure57,58. Here, for the first
time using radiotelemetry blood pressure probes, we recorded
circadian cardiovascular parameters continuously for individual
cloned and ET-control sheep kept as a group in a stress-free
environment. Ambulatory blood pressure of these cloned animals
was similar to ET-controls and within the normal range for other
sheep reported in the literature (that is, B120/80 mmHg;
Supplementary Table 4). It was also similar to adult blood
pressure in healthy humans. Classification of ‘hypertension’ in
humans begins at a systolic blood pressure Z140 mmHg (ref. 59)
or B20 mmHg above resting. The elderly cloned sheep in this
study could not, therefore, be considered to be hypertensive.
Direct i.v. infusion of angiotensin II, to further challenge
cardiovascular responsivity, failed to induce a greater pressor
response than in ET-controls. We therefore conclude that cloning
by SCNT had no detrimental, latent effect on the cardiovascular
system of sheep in this study that survived into late adulthood.
Detailed musculoskeletal investigations were undertaken of all
sheep, as Dolly had required treatment for OA from around 5
years of age, raising concerns over premature ageing in cloned
animals22–24. Radiographs taken of Dolly showed OA in the left
stifle (knee), however OA was evident in both stifles at post-
mortem examination 18 months later (TJ King, Roslin Institute,
personal communication). The consensus at that time was that,
because the OA was localized rather than generalized, it was more
likely of traumatic aetiology. However, the aetiopathogenesis of
OA is accepted to be multifactorial, involving both genetic and
acquired factors (such as joint trauma/overloading, and obesity).
The prevalence increases with age (the strongest risk factor), but
the course of the disease varies greatly between individuals60,61.
Clinical examination of cloned sheep in the present study
revealed only mild lameness in the left foreleg of one animal,
which may have been associated with her slightly abnormal
forelimb conformation. None of the Finn-Dorset clones had an
abnormal gait or showed lameness. Several clones had soft tissue

acetabulae, with minimal remodelling and no obvious osteophytosis. A mild
increase in bone density (white) is evident around both acetabular rims

acetabulum or femoral head and neck regions. This sheep therefore has
minimal radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis. The circular opacity is a

 swelling or fibrous thickenings of various parts of their limbs, as
would be expected in a random sample of sheep. However, these
did not appear to be associated with any discomfort. Subsequent
radiography revealed mild OA in various joints in several sheep.
It is not surprising that no sheep showed marked lameness, as
radiographic changes indicative of OA do not necessarily
correlate with the extent of clinical disease62. Mild OA (scored
by two independent reviewers) was seen most often in the hip
(13 of 13 sheep) and stifle (12 of 13 sheep) joints. Scott63 reported
that the stifle and elbow joints are most commonly affected by
joint trauma. However in the present study, only 5 of 13 sheep
showed elbow OA, which was bilateral in most cases. Only Clone
2262 had significant OA in multiple, but not all, joints. The
majority of sheep appeared to have a mild increase in bone
density of the acetabular rim, however none had significant
osteophytosis or remodelling of the acetabulum or femoral head
and neck as would be expected with OA. Similar findings were
apparent in pelvic radiographs of eight healthy 5-year-old sheep
(Supplementary Fig. 2), enroled in an unrelated study, made
available courtesy of Professors Allen Goodship and Gordon
Blunn (University College London). Thus it may be a normal
radiographic finding in healthy ageing sheep, and not, in
isolation, indicative of OA. This will be further assessed when
post-mortem examination of the present cohort is undertaken at
a future time.
Radiographic changes appear relatively late in the disease
process and so MRI of the stifles (knees) of the four Finn-Dorset
clones was undertaken, as MRI is more sensitive in detecting early
structural changes60. To minimize the duration of sedation
required, MRI scans were taken only of the stifle joints, because
these were among the most commonly affected joints in our
population, and were affected in Dolly23. T2* and proton density,
fat-saturated MRI images provided the most useful diagnostic
information, showing periarticular osteophytosis primarily on the
trochlear ridges and caudal tibia. However, the extent of the
disease remained mild, and not unexpected in aged sheep.
Reports of OA in non-experimental sheep are rare in the
literature. A case series was reported by Scott64, describing elbow
OA in 10 sheep (aged 2 to 5 years) that had shown forelimb
lameness of at least 3 months duration. A post-mortem study of
the stifle joints of 65 clinically normal sheep aged 6 months to 11
years by Vandeweerd et al.65 identified cartilage defects in 66% of
the sheep, the severity of the lesions increasing with age. These
authors proposed that OA exists in normal ageing sheep, and is
not always associated with clinical signs. Pathological changes
were also found in the femoral head cartilage of clinically normal
2.5- to 3-year-old sheep by Zilkens et al66. Thus there is no
evidence of an increased incidence or severity of OA in the clones
in this study. However, a single cloned sheep in the present study
had obvious OA in multiple joints, although it varied in severity
between joints, and not all joints were affected. It is not surprising
that the joints were variably affected, as studies in humans have
shown, for example, that a factor such as obesity increases the risk
of knee OA by a factor of three, but has less effect on hip OA60.
As discussed previously, a more homogenous distribution might
have been expected, both within and between sheep, if cloning by
SCNT was a direct causative factor in the development of OA.
From the current series of assessments we conclude that there
are no long-term detrimental health effects of cloning by SCNT
for a long-lived species such as the sheep. This conclusion is
consistent with less detailed longevity studies in cattle17, and
suggests that the ageing process in surviving clones of large
animal species is not accelerated. On initial inspection, our data
in sheep may appear at odds with the health status of Dolly and
predictions of premature ageing, which were based on terminal
restriction fragment analyses of her genomic DNA20. While
telomere length was reduced in SCNT clones relative to
age-matched controls in that and subsequent studies in sheep67,
these effects did not manifest following SCNT in cattle21. Further
inconsistent reports of shorter telomeres in cloned offspring from
other species68 have led to the consensus that telomere length is
generally restored during nuclear reprogramming69. The extent of
telomere restoration in turn is dictated by intricate epigenetic
alterations to telomeric and sub-telomeric chromatin, variation in
which could explain discrepancies between species and donor cell
types within species. It follows that the relationship between
telomere length, health and longevity in multicellular organisms
is complex and, for our current cohort of animals, awaits organ-
specific cell enrichment and analysis following post-mortem at a
future date.

 In conclusion, although the efficiency of SCNT has improved
in recent years, its overall efficiency remains low, with high
embryonic and gestational losses compared to natural mating and
assisted reproduction. A relatively high proportion of clones also
fail to successfully make the transition to extra-uterine life, some
harbouring congenital defects, such as observed in the kidney. For
those clones that survive beyond the perinatal period, however,
the emerging consensus, supported by the current data, is that
they are healthy and seem to age normally.
Methods
Animal work. Animal work was conducted under the authority of the United
Kingdom Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, and approval was obtained
from the University of Nottingham Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Board
before commencement of these studies.
Genetic identity of cloned sheep. This was confirmed using 21 microsatellite
markers including those recommended by the International Society of Animal
Genetics (Supplementary Table 1). Sheep blood samples and cell lines were sub-
mitted for PCR and fragment analysis to an independent genetic Company
(VHL Genetics, The Netherlands). PCR amplification and fragment analysis was
conducted in an ABI PRISM 3130XL automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems),
and the amplified fragments were classified using the GENESCAN 3.7 software
(Applied Biosystems). We undertook a blinded pairing of cloned sheep and
parental cells, and all clones matched their cells of origin for all 21 markers
(CERVUS v.3.0 software70).
Reference population (ET-controls). This consisted of a group of 6-year-old
virgin male (n ¼ 6) and female (n ¼ 11) Suffolk x Scottish Blackface sheep gener-
ated as part of the study of Sinclair et al.44. These animals were the offspring of the
control group of normally fed ET donors in that study, and were accommodated in
pens adjacent to the cloned offspring where they were fed the same diet. Health
assessments were originally reported for these animals at two years of age44.
Further assessments of body composition, glucose and insulin tolerance, and blood
pressure were undertaken again for these animals at 6 years of age using protocols
described herein.
Whole animal body composition. Glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity are
each challenged in the obese state43, which is why we endeavoured to create this
condition in both our reference population of ET-controls and clones. Animals
were fed a proprietary concentrate (Manor Farm Feeds, Owston, Leicestershire,
UK) consisting 60 g kg � 1 oil, 145 g kg � 1 crude protein, 80 g kg � 1 fibre and
65 g kg � 1 ash, in a mixed diet with meadow hay (dry matter (DM), 830 g kg � 1;
metabolizable energy, 8.5 MJ kg � 1 DM; crude protein, 95 g kg � 1 DM). This diet
was fed on an ad libitum basis. To standardize body composition, body condition
scores (BCS) (1[thin] to 5[obese] scale34), were obtained at fortnightly intervals for
these animals with the aim of attaining a BCS of 4.0 units at the time of metabolic
assessments, equivalent to approximately 40% total body fat in mature female
ewes35. Formal assessments of body composition were assessed by DEXA using
a validated in-house protocol71. Animals were sedated (intramuscular (i.m.)
0.1 mg kg � 1 Xylazine; i.v. 4 mg kg � 1 Ketamine) and scanned transversally along
the longitudinal axis using a Norland XR-800 DXA scanner. The scan lasted
B15 min after which animals were returned to the barn.
Glucose and insulin tolerance tests. Glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity
were determined using standard in-house protocols44,71. Briefly, for the GTT, basal
plasma insulin and glucose concentrations were established 4 h after the animals’
morning meal. Infusion of sterile glucose (i.v. 0.4 g � kg � 1 body weight given as a
single bolus) was followed by blood sample collection from indwelling jugular
catheters into K þEDTA vacutainers at 5, 10, 20, 30 40, 60, 90 and 120 min. The
insulin tolerance tests were carried out before the morning meal. Infusion of insulin
(0.75 IU kg � 1) was followed by blood collection into K þ EDTA vacutainers at
two-minute intervals up to 16 min, and then again at 30 and 60 min. Plasma
glucose concentrations were determined on a Cobas Miras Plus autoanalyzer
(ABX Diagnostics); the kit for glucose was supplied by Randox Laboratories
(catalogue no. GL2623). Plasma insulin concentrations were determined using
an ovine specific insulin ELISA kit (Mercodia AB, Uppsala, Sweden).
Radiotelemetric assessments of heart rate and blood pressure. Sheep were
anaesthetised for general surgery using i.v. ketamine (2.0 mg kg � 1) and midazolam
(0.3 mg kg � 1), dosed to effect for intubation. Anaesthesia was maintained with
isoflurane (1–2% in O2). Solid-state pressure radiotelemeters designed for large
animal use (TRM84PB; Telemetry Research, NZ and distributed in the UK by
Millar Inc, Oxon, UK) were inserted (10 cm) into the carotid artery with the body
of the transmitter secured subcutaneously in the neck (Supplementary Fig. 1).
The incision site was closed and the animal recovered to a pen. Post-operative
antibiotics were administered (i.m. long-acting amoxycillin) and analgesia
maintained with a fentanyl (0.2 mg kg � 1) patch fixed to the forelimb. Sheep (4 on
each occasion) were recovered to a floor pen and wireless recording of individual
cardiovascular parameters (for example, blood pressures, heart rate) began
immediately for 3–4 days for each sheep. Continuous recording at a sampling
rate of 2 kHz was pre-programmed for 10 min of each hour, all day and night
for all four sheep in each batch using an automated scheduler pod linked
to data acquisition software (LabChart 7; AD Instruments, Oxon, UK). On the
final day, all sheep were challenged with a step-wise incremental Angiotensin II
(0–60 ng kg � 1 min � 1; Sigma-Aldrich, UK) infusion, delivered into the jugular
vein after earlier venipuncture and restraint in a metabolic crate. Recording at this
time was of individual sheep on a second-by-second basis. Sampled data were
stored, analysed and minute means derived (after exclusion of artefacts) using
LabChart 7 and MS Excel. Telemeters were surgically removed from all sheep
under general anaesthesia the following day, following similar protocols as
described above. The solid-state telemeters were used (after recalibration and
sterilization) on three separate occasions, to obtain cardiovascular data for ten
sheep (n ¼ 4, Finn-Dorset clones; n ¼ 6, Lleyn clones). Cardiovascular protocols
were successfully completed in all sheep.
Clinical examination and diagnostic imaging of joints. All sheep underwent a
full musculoskeletal examination by a veterinary orthopaedic specialist (co-author
SC) involving visual assessment of gait, followed by palpation and manipulation of
the limbs and spine. Palpation assessed for evidence of muscle atrophy, swelling,
heat or pain in the limb. Manipulation assessed individual joints for range of
motion, pain or crepitus. The feet were also examined for pathology. Assessment of
gait was made using the seven-point scale (0 to 6) developed by Kaler et al39.
All sheep were subsequently sedated (i.m. 0.1 mg kg � 1 Xylazine; i.v. 4 mg kg � 1
Ketamine) for 10 to 15 minutes to obtain mediolateral radiographs of both hocks,
stifles, elbows and carpi, and a ventrodorsal view of the pelvis, including both hips
and the lumbosacral junction. Shoulders were radiographed but the images found
to be of inconsistent quality for valid interpretation. Radiographs were taken using
a portable Tru-DR Digital Radiography System, with laptop (R8-51D45) and plate
(50-C907-08B) (BCF Technology Ltd, Strathclyde, UK), and analysed using OsiriX
Lite (http://www.osirix-viewer.com/download_form/download_form.php). Images
were assessed for evidence of OA, and graded using a modified Kellgren and
Lawrence40 scale. Assessment of joint space width was not undertaken as the sheep
were sedated and recumbent (that is, non-weight-bearing) when the radiographs
were taken. Radiographs were scored independently by two veterinary orthopaedic
specialists (co-author SAC, and Malcolm Ness, independent) who were unaware
of sheep identity. OA was graded based on the presence of osteophytes and
bone remodelling, where 0 ¼ no evidence, 1 ¼ questionable, mild osteophytosis,
2 ¼ moderate osteophytosis and minor bone remodelling, and 3 ¼ severe
osteophytosis with definite bone remodelling. The four Finn-Dorset clones
underwent MRI of their stifle joints, using a mobile MRI scanner (Burgess
Diagnostics Ltd. Earnshaw Business Centre, Hugh Lane Leyland PR26 6PD), with a
high-field 1.5Tesla magnet (Philips Medical Systems, Achieva). Sheep were induced
using i.v. ketamine (2.0 mg kg � 1) and midazolam (0.3 mg kg � 1), dosed to effect
for intubation. Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane (1–2% in O2). Scans
were obtained using a SENSE Flex-S receiver coil and Body Transmit Coil, with a
130mm Field of View. Transverse T1, Saggital T2*, PD and PDFS protocols used to
obtain images extending from 2 cm proximal to the patella, to 5 cm distal to the
tibial plateau. Images were transferred in DICOM format on CD and subsequently
analysed using OsiriX Lite.
Statistical analyses. Because the six Lleyn clones were derived from a study
that assessed the effects of Xenopus oocyte extract before nuclear transfer on
pregnancy outcomes30, we initially investigated if this had any influence on our
measurements of body composition, glucose metabolism and blood pressure by
ANOVA. As the extract had no effect we treated these animals as a single cohort in
all subsequent analyses. Glucose and insulin tolerance tests were subsequently
analysed by repeated-measures ANOVA (with Bonferroni correction for
comparisons between means) where clone identity (Finn-Dorset, Lleyn) and time
formed the fixed effects. Single values for incremental areas under the response
curves were generated for each individual using the trapezoid rule in Prism 6
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) and were analysed by one-way ANOVA
with Bonferroni correction for comparisons between means. For cardiovascular
analyses, data were either analysed as summary measures (e.g. minute means of
sec-sec radiotelemetry pressures or heart rate) and analysed similarly to metabolic
data or, to test for any circadian effects, by incorporating all recorded
cardiovascular datapoints (B2,500–4,500 for each animal) into a non-linear
regression model fitting a Fourier-curve (Y ¼ a þ �sin(2p(X þ e)/w) to derive four
parameters a, set-point; b, amplitude; w, wavelength and e, offset. No sheep
exhibited any circadian cardiovascular rhythm (pressure or heart rate) and
therefore only baseline (average for each variable) or minute means of responses
(for example, to angiotensin II infusion) are presented. All data were analysed
using Genstat v18 (VSNi, Rothampsted, UK) and are presented as means±s.e.m.
or s.e.d. (standard error of the differences between means, for a more conservative
estimate of the contrast variance).
