Background: Dupuytren's disease is a common fibrotic condition of the hand that causes irreversible flexion con-
tractures of the fingers, with no approved therapy for early stage disease. Our previous analysis of surgically-
excised tissue defined tumour necrosis factor (TNF) as a potential therapeutic target. Here we assessed the
efficacy of injecting nodules of Dupuytren's disease with a TNF inhibitor.
Methods: Patients were randomised to receive adalimumab on one occasion in dose cohorts of 15 mg in 0.3 ml,
35 mg in 0.7 ml, or 40 mg in 0.4 ml, or an equivalent volume of placebo in a 3:1 ratio. Two weeks later the injected
tissue was surgically excised and analysed. The primary outcome measure was levels of mRNA expression for α-
smooth muscle actin (ACTA2). Secondary outcomes included levels of α-SMA and collagen proteins. The trial was
registered with ClinicalTrial.gov (NCT03180957) and the EudraCT (2015-001780-40).
Findings: We recruited 28 patients, 8 assigned to the 15 mg, 12 to the 35 mg and 8 to the 40 mg adalimumab cohorts.
There was no change in mRNA levels for ACTA2, COL1A1, COL3A1 and CDH11. Levels of α-SMA protein expression in
patients treated with 40 mg adalimumab (1.09 ± 0.09 ng per μg of total protein) were significantly lower (p =
0.006) compared to placebo treated patients (1.51 ± 0.09 ng/μg). The levels of procollagen type I protein expression
were also significantly lower (p b 0.019) in the sub group treated with 40 mg adalimumab (474 ± 84 pg/μg total
protein) compared with placebo (817 ± 78 pg/μg). There were two serious adverse events, both considered unre-
lated to the study drug.
Interpretation: In this dose-ranging study, injection of 40 mg of adalimumab in 0.4 ml resulted in down regulation of
the myofibroblast phenotype as evidenced by reduction in expression of α-SMA and type I procollagen proteins at
2 weeks. These data form the basis of an ongoing phase 2b clinical trial assessing the efficacy of intranodular injec-
tion of 40 mg adalimumab in 0.4 ml compared to an equivalent volume of placebo in patients with early stage
Dupuytren's disease.

1. Introduction
Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a common fibrotic disease confined to
the hand that affects approximately 4% of the general UK and US popu-
lations [1]. The early stages of the disease are manifest as nodules that
are typically quiescent for a period and then become active, progressing
to cords and flexion deformities of the fingers in approximately 50% of
patients [2] and result in loss of hand function [3]. Whilst the mainstay
of treatment remains surgical excision (fasciectomy) of the diseased tis-
sue or cords [4], approximately 40% of patients in the USA are treated by
disruption of the cords using collagenase or needle fasciotomy [5].
Generally patients undergo these treatments when digits are flexed to
30° or more and hand function is impaired [6]. The recurrence rate
following surgery is 21% within 5 years [7] and these individuals may
require more extensive surgery involving excision of the diseased tissue
and overlying skin (dermofasciectomy). Post-operatively, some pa-
tients require prolonged hand therapy and splintage. Complications
occur in approximately 20% of patients undergoing surgery [8]. Alterna-
tive, less invasive techniques to disrupt the cords with a needle or colla-
genase digestion are associated with rapid recovery of hand function
with minimal therapy. However, recurrence rates are high, affecting

 85% of patients treated with percutaneous needle aponeurotomy [7]
and 32% of those treated with collagenase [9] at 5 years. The complica-
tion rate is 20% following needle aponeurotomy [8] and over 70% after
collagenase injection, the majority being minor and mostly transient
[10].
The ideal therapy would be directed towards patients with early
stage disease to prevent progression to development of cords and sub-
sequent flexion contractures of the digits. Our systematic review [11]
highlighted the lack of robust evidence for treatments proposed for
early stage DD for which there is currently no approved therapy. Studies
reporting the efficacy of intranodular injection of steroids or radiother-
apy are limited by a lack of quality, with no blinding or randomisation
and the use of subjective outcome measures [11]. Fifty percent of pa-
tients receiving steroid therapy developed transient subcutaneous atro-
phy or depigmentation. Approximately 20–30% of patients receiving
radiotherapy developed long-term adverse effects, including dry skin,
desquamation, skin atrophy, telangiectasia, erythema, and altered heat
and pain sensation. A recent trial reported that injection of collagenase
resulted in nodules becoming smaller and softer, with approximately
50% of patients experiencing bruising and pain [12]. Therefore, there is
a need to develop an effective therapy to retard progression of early
DD and also prevent the development of recurrent disease following
surgery, needle fasciotomy or collagenase injection in patients with
established finger contractures.
The cell responsible for deposition of the excessive collagenous
matrix and contraction in all fibrotic conditions, including DD, is the
myofibroblast [13, 14], which is characterised by the expression of α-
smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) [15]. Unlike the fibrotic diseases of
visceral organs such as the kidney, lung and liver, tissue from patients
with DD is readily accessible, allowing identification of potential novel
therapeutic targets [16]. Using surgically excised tissue from patients
we found that the myofibroblasts in DD are aggregated in nodules in
the vicinity of the affected joints, and nodules were absent in patients
with more advanced stage disease [17]. Interspersed through the nod-
ule are immune cells, including macrophages, T cells and mast cells,
and the nodular cells secrete a variety of cytokines [18]. Comparison
of the effects of each of these cytokines showed that only tumour necro-
sis factor (TNF) converted palmar fibroblasts from patients with DD into
myofibroblasts at the low concentrations seen ex vivo, but not non-
palmar fibroblasts from the same patients or palmar fibroblasts from
normal individuals. In contrast, TGF-β indiscriminately converts all fi-
broblasts into myofibroblasts [18]. This is important as the fibrotic pro-
cess seen in DD is limited to the palm of genetically susceptible
individuals. Genome-wide association studies have highlighted the
role of Wnt signalling in DD [19, 20] and we found that TNF acted via
the Wnt signalling pathway only in palmar dermal fibroblasts from pa-
tients with DD [18]. Myofibroblasts from DD showed a dose-dependent
reduction in contractility on treatment with anti-TNF, with a concomi-
tant reduction in expression of α-SMA [18]. All the clinically approved
anti-TNF agents assessed were effective in down regulating DD
myofibroblast contractility in vitro, with the two fully human IgG mole-
cules, adalimumab and golimumab being the most efficacious at the
doses tested [18].
Here we report the effects of injection of escalating doses of
adalimumab or corresponding volume of placebo directly into the nod-
ules of patients who then underwent surgery two weeks later. Markers
of myofibroblast phenotype and collagen production were assessed in
the excised samples.
2. Methods
2.1. Study Design and Patients
Repurposing anti-TNF for Dupuytren's disease (RIDD) is a two-part
phase 2 randomised, double-blinded placebo-controlled dose response
study to assess the efficacy of local injection of adalimumab in patients
with DD. The protocol was reviewed by the South Central Oxford B
Research Ethics Committee (Reference number 15/SC/0259) and the
Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (EudraCT no:
2015-001780-40) and has been published [21] (details of subsequent
amendments in appendix). The phase 2a dose escalation study reported
here was performed at a single centre in the UK at the Edinburgh De-
partment of Plastic Surgery at St John's Hospital, NHS Lothian. Patients
referred to the hand surgery service at St John's Hospital by their general
practitioner with a diagnosis of DD were screened for entry to the trial.
Eligibility criteria included no prior treatment for Dupuytren's disease to
the affected hand, a clinically distinct nodule of DD, suitability for injec-
tion of adalimumab and fasciectomy. All potential participants were
screened for TB, HIV, hepatitis B and C using serological testing and
chest X-ray in accordance with local standard procedures for anti-TNF
screening.
During the study a new preparation of adalimumab became avail-
able with 40 mg formulated in 0.4 ml. The lower volume and absence
of excipients including citrate was expected to result in reduced pain
and improve participant acceptability. Therefore, the trial design was
modified to include a cohort at a dose of 40 mg using this preparation.
The 40 mg in 0.4 ml formulation is currently only available in a pre-
filled single use syringe and so only the full syringe dose of 40 mg
could be administered with this formulation. Therefore, the trial design
was modified to include a cohort of 40 mg in 0.4 ml. Since publication,
the protocol has been amended to introduce an endpoint to assess
whether adalimumab affects the healing of the surgical incisions or
subsequent scarring. This visual assessment of the surgical wounds
was carried out by blinded review of the hand photographs taken at
baseline and then at 2 and 4 weeks post-surgery.
2.2. Procedures
Patients were randomised (3:1) to receive either adalimumab or sa-
line in 3 dose cohorts (15 mg in 0.3 ml, 35 mg in 0.7 ml), both using the
40 mg in 0.8 ml preparation, or 40 mg in 0.4 ml using the more recently
introduced formulation, or an equivalent volume of placebo (normal sa-
line) on one occasion by intra-nodular injection two weeks (±3 days)
prior to scheduled surgery. Nodule hardness was measured using a du-
rometer (RX-1800-00, Rex Gauge Company, Illinois, USA) and nodule
size was assessed using an ultrasound scan before injection and again
before surgery. Blood was collected at baseline and again immediately
before surgery, and the serum stored at -80 °C prior to analysis. ELISA
kits from Promonitor were used according to the manufacturer's in-
structions to measure serum levels of adalimumab (Cat. No. 728552)
and anti-adalimumab (Cat. No. 728533). All samples were measured
in duplicate and repeated on 3 plates using a FLUOstar Omega Spectro-
photometer (BMG Labtech) and MARS™ software. Pain related to the
adalimumab injection was rated by the participant and the injection
site assessed by visual inspection. Following surgery, the excised
Dupuytren's tissue was transported to the lab, where the nodule was
dissected to retain a central piece for histological examination whilst
the remainder was frozen and pulverised. The resulting powder was
split in two for protein or RNA extraction and stored at −80 °C. RNA
was extracted and following the generation of cDNA, absolute levels of
ACTA2, COL1A1, COL3A1 and CDH11 were determined using the standard
curve method (appendix). Procollagen 1A1 protein levels were deter-
mined by DuoSet ELISA reagents (DY6220-05, R&D systems, Oxon,
UK) in triplicate following the manufacturer's instructions. α-SMA
protein levels were determined using a custom developed MSD® plate
(appendix 2). Tissue samples for histology were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde, longitudinally bisected, embedded in paraffin wax
and 7 μm sections obtained from the cut surface. Sequential sections
were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, mouse anti–α-SMA antibody
(Abcam 7817) or a mouse isotype control. Antibodies were detected
using biotinylated anti-mouse antibody and avidin/biotin/HRP complex
reagent (Vectastain ABC, Vector Lab, UK). Patients completed their

 standard care following surgery, returning at 2 weeks (±1 week) for as-
sessment of the wound, change of dressing and commencement of hand
therapy. Final clinical assessment was at 12 weeks (±4 weeks), when a
photograph was obtained for final blinded assessment of wound healing
and scarring.
2.3. Outcomes
The primary outcome was mRNA expression of ACTA2 (α-SMA). Sec-
ondary outcomes comprised mRNA expression for COL1A1, COL3A1 and
CDH11, and protein levels of α-SMA. Protein levels of type I procollagen,
type III procollagen, acid and pepsin soluble and insoluble collagen,
alongside nodule hardness and size of the nodule on ultrasound scan
were also assessed. Adverse events were assessed using visual inspec-
tion of the injection site and site of surgery, photographs and laboratory
reports. Tertiary outcomes comprised circulating levels of adalimumab,
antibodies to adalimumab and participant injection experience
recorded as pain during injection using a 5-level Likert scale (1 =
Not at all), and immediately after injection also using a Likert scale
(1–10, 1 = no pain).
2.4. Randomisation and Masking
Participants were randomised for treatment with placebo or
adalimumab using a 1:3 ratio with a block size of four. The dose cohort
was determined by the progression of the trial, with initial patients allo-
cated to the lowest dose cohort (15 mg adalimumab) and doses esca-
lated (35 mg then 40 mg adalimumab) following a review of patient
wound healing two weeks after surgery. The volume of saline solution
for the placebo treatment matched the relevant volume associated
with the dose cohort to ensure blinding. The allocation log, generated
by the trial statistician, using the statistical software STATA version
13.0, was stored securely within the hospital pharmacy. Due to the dis-
tinctive packaging of the 40 mg in 0.4 ml preparation of adalimumab in
pre-filled syringes, blinding of the person administering the injection
was not feasible and therefore this healthcare professional was inde-
pendent and not involved with routine patient care, recruitment, out-
come assessment, surgery or follow-up. A shield prevented patients in
this dose cohort from seeing the syringe. For all cohorts, participants,
healthcare and laboratory professionals involved in recruitment, sur-
gery, follow-up and outcome assessment were blinded to treatment
allocation.
2.5. Statistical Analysis
This study was designed as a phase 2a clinical trial to enable
estimation of potential dose and efficacy of adalimumab in inhibiting
progression of DD. As no previous studies have explored the effect of
adalimumab on in vivo expression of ACTA2 mRNA, sample size was de-
termined using in vitro findings and inflated to account for the non-
clinical nature of the research upon which estimation was performed.
Descriptive statistics, complemented using exploratory data analyses,
were used to assess the demographics across intervention groups for
each dose based on an intention-to-treat population. Additional
analyses were performed using either linear mixed modelling or nested
analysis of variance to account for trial structure, which included a
random-effects component to allow for the values from three plates
and duplicates per participant. Where appropriate, Tukey's HSD adjust-
ment for multiplicity was applied when assessing contrasts. For the
basis of most contrasts the patients allocated to placebo were pooled.
The validity of samples for circulating levels of adalimumab could not
be verified for three patients. To address this, a per-protocol approach
was adopted and the corresponding patients were excluded from
analysis.
2.6. Role of the Funding Source
The study was funded by the Health Innovation Challenge Fund
(Wellcome Trust and Department of Health). Funding for purchase of
the adalimumab was provided by 180 Therapeutics LLP. The funders
had no involvement in study design or data analyses. The study was
sponsored by the University of Oxford. Raw unblinded data were
analysed by the trial statisticians (WS and SD) and subsequently made
available to the remainder of the trial team. The corresponding author
drafted the manuscript in conjunction with all the other authors and
all share the responsibility for submission for publication.
3. Results
3.1. Patient Demographics
Between November 2015 and November 2016, 85 participants were
screened and 28 were randomised to successive dose escalation cohorts,
8 to the 15 mg adalimumab cohort, 12 to the 35 mg adalimumab cohort
and 8 to the 40 mg adalimumab cohort. In each cohort, patients were
randomised in a ratio of 3:1 to receive either adalimumab or an equiva-
lent volume of placebo (saline) (Fig. 1). Baseline characteristics were
similar between different cohorts (Table 1).
3.2. Outcomes
There was no difference between any of the groups, including pla-
cebo, in mRNA levels for genes that encode ACTA2, COL1A1, COL3A1 or
CDH11 (Fig. 2). Levels of α-SMA protein expression in patients treated
with 40 mg adalimumab (1.09 ± 0.09 ng per μg of total protein) were
statistically significantly lower (p = 0.006) compared to placebo treated
patients (1.51 ± 0.09 ng per μg of total protein) and compared to those
treated with 15 mg (1.60 ± 0.09 ng per μg of total protein; p b 0.001) or
35 mg (1.44 ± 0.08 ng per μg of total protein; p = 0.024) adalimumab,
whilst 35 mg and 15 mg adalimumab cohorts showed no difference
compared to placebo (Fig. 3). Qualitative assessment of immunohisto-
chemical staining for α-SMA showed reduced intensity for the re-
sponders in the 40 mg cohort compared to placebo (appendix,
Supplementary Fig. 1).
The levels of procollagen type I protein expression were significantly
lower (p = 0.019) in the subgroup treated with 40 mg adalimumab
(474 ± 84 pg/μg total protein) compared with placebo (817 ±
78 pg/μg total protein) (Fig. 4). Pro-collagen type I levels were below
the minimum limit for quantification of 250 pg/μg in three patients
injected 35 mg adalimumab and two injected with 40 mg adalimumab.
Tissue from nodules surgically excised two weeks after injection was
also assessed for levels of procollagen type III and collagen using the
Biocolor (UK) Sircol Soluble and Insoluble Collagen Assays. There were
no differences between treatment groups and placebo for either assay.
Plasma levels of adalimumab and antibodies to adalimumab were
assayed prior to intra-nodular injection of adalimumab and repeated
2 weeks (±3 days) after injection, prior to surgery. Prior to nodule injec-
tion, circulating blood adalimumab levels were below the minimum de-
tectable limit for all patients. At two weeks after injection, patients
within the placebo treatment group had undetectable levels of blood
adalimumab whilst all patients within adalimumab treatment groups
demonstrated detectable levels (appendix, Supplementary Table 1).
Two weeks after treatment, no antibodies to adalimumab were detected
amongst placebo treated patients, demonstrating assay specificity and
the absence of cross reactivity. Antibodies were detected in one patient
treated with 15 mg adalimumab, 5 patients treated with 35 mg
adalimumab and two patients treated with 40 mg adalimumab. How-
ever, antibody levels only exceeded the minimum threshold for clinical
significance [22] of 12 AU/ml in two of the three repeat measurements
(mean±SD, 12.4±0.63 AU/ml) in one patient treated with 35 mg
adalimumab.
284
J. Nanchahal et al. / EBioMedicine 33 (2018) 282–288
 Ultrasound scans performed prior to injection and two weeks later
prior to surgery showed no significant changes in any of the dose
cohorts in nodule size based on the area of the nodule, the length of
the perimeter and the feret (maximum length across the nodule)
(appendix, Supplementary Fig. 2). Similarly, there was no change in
nodule hardness measured using a durometer in any of the dose cohorts
when comparing before and two weeks after injection (appendix,
Supplementary Fig. 3).
All but one patient reported pain during the injection, with higher
levels of pain experienced with larger volumes and with the more dilute
formulation of adalimumab. The Likert scores immediately after injec-
tion showed that high volume of injection (0.7 ml) was associated
with more pain than lower volumes (0.3–0.4 ml) and that the 40 mg
in 0.4 ml adalimumab formulation was associated with lower pain
scores (appendix, Supplementary Fig. 4).
3.3. Adverse Events
Two patients suffered serious adverse events (SAE) after injection.
One patient fell two months before injection of placebo whilst running
and presented 5 days after surgery for DD with impaired motor function
due to bilateral subdural haematomas that were treated non-
operatively. He made a full recovery with spontaneous resolution of

 the haematomas. A patient with type 2 diabetes who received an injec-
tion of 35 mg of adalimumab into a nodule situated over the proximal
phalanx of the little finger presented four days after surgical fasciectomy
with a suture abscess at the distal palmar crease in the axis of the ring
finger. He was initially treated with oral antibiotics by his general prac-
titioner but due to lack of improvement after 5 days he was admitted to
hospital for i.v. antibiotics. Inspection of the wounds revealed erythema
around the sutures and a small amount of pus was expressed following
suture removal. He was discharged home the following day on oral
antibiotics and the wound healed uneventfully. Blinded assessment of

 showed well-healed mature scars in all patients except the patient who
developed the post-operative wound infection, where the scars were
more prominent. Both events were considered by the local investigator
and an independent reviewer not to be related to the investigational
medicinal product and the second SAE was considered to be related to
the surgical procedure.
Swelling at the injection site was only apparent in 3 patients receiving
35 mg adalimumab and two receiving 0.7 ml saline. Transient redness
was noted at the injection site in 7 patients distributed across the differ-
ent treatment groups. No patient experienced blistering, haematoma,
bruising, local itching or signs of nerve injury. No patient reported any ad-
verse events one week after injection.
4. Discussion
Our results show that two weeks following administration of 40 mg of
adalimumab in 0.4 ml into Dupuytren's nodules there was down regula-
tion of the myofibroblast phenotype as evidenced by lower expression of
α-SMA and pro-collagen type I proteins. These findings represent the
clinical translation of our in vitro data based on human tissue where we
showed that tumour necrosis factor (TNF) selectively converts precursor
palmar fibroblasts from Dupuytren's patients to myofibroblasts via the
Wnt signalling pathway, and anti-TNF is inhibitory [18]. Like all fibrotic
conditions, Dupuytren's disease is characterised by the deposition of ex-
cessive collagenous extracellular matrix which is remodelled and
contracted by α-SMA-expressing myofibroblasts [15], that aggregate in
nodules [17]. Collagen is synthesised and secreted in the precursor state
as procollagen and the N- and C-terminal globular domains are cleaved
at the plasma membrane to produce tropocollagen that self-aggregates
to form fibrils, which grow and are eventually cross-linked by lysyl oxi-
dase to form insoluble collagen [23]. The soluble Sircol assay detects all
the uncross-linked forms and the insoluble assay only detects the cross-
linked collagens. The short half-life of procollagen due to its rapid conver-
sion to fibrillar collagen may explain the reduction in type I procollagen
we observed at the two-week primary endpoint and it is possible that
soluble and insoluble collagens may also change but at later time points.
Although type III collagen comprises 35–49% of the total [24] in
Dupuytren's nodules, which represent the earlier stages of disease, we
were unable to detect any changes in type III procollagen due to the
poor sensitivity of the only commercially available assay, with levels fall-
ing below the threshold of detection in half of samples in all treatment
groups. The downregulation of both procollagen and the contractile pro-
tein α-SMA by local inhibition of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) provides
the first successful proof of concept for targeted treatment of the patho-
logical mechanisms underlying this common localised fibrotic disease
of the hand that affects 4% of the general UK and US populations [1].
There was no change in the levels mRNA levels for genes that encode
for ACTA2, COL1A1, COL3A1 and CDH11. The most likely explanation for
the down regulation in protein expression for α-SMA and type I
procollagen without a concomitant change in the respective mRNA is
that expression of these proteins is predominantly regulated at the
post-transcriptional level. We have previously shown to be the case
for α-SMA in Dupuytren's myofibroblasts [25], but did not select α-
SMA protein levels as the primary outcome measure as the assay for
the protein was optimised over the course of the trial. Collagen 1 ex-
pression is also mainly regulated post translationally in fibrotic condi-
tions [26]. Another potential but less likely explanation would be
different half-lives of mRNA and collagen proteins of hours and days re-
spectively [26], which would potentially allow mRNA levels to recover
at 2 weeks whilst corresponding protein levels remained suppressed.
The downregulation of α-SMA and procollagen type I only occurred
in patients where 40 mg of adalimumab in 0.4 ml was injected directly
into the nodule, but not following administration of 35 mg in 0.7 ml.
This could be explained by some of the adalimumab in the more dilute
preparation extravasating out of the nodule and hence not available to
act at high concentrations locally on the aggregates of myofibroblasts
and immune cells. An alternative but less likely explanation is that the
excipients in the more dilute preparation of adalimumab rendered it
less efficacious for this application. Our data would suggest that only
high local concentrations of adalimumab are effective in down regulat-
ing the myofibroblast phenotype in DD and it is unlikely adalimumab or
other anti-TNF drugs would be efficacious if administered systemically.
This would be consistent with the low-grade inflammation that is con-
fined to the nodules of DD [18]. The half-life of adalimumab is 2 weeks
[27], and trough levels at this time for patients on regular systemic ther-
apy of 40 mg every 2 weeks averaged ~5μg/ml in patients with rheuma-
toid arthritis and 6–10μg/ml in patients with psoriatic arthropathy not
treated with concomitant methotrexate [27]. This would suggest that
the kinetics of absorption of adalimumab when injected into the nod-
ules of DD may be similar to when the drug is administered subcutane-
ously. We would postulate that formulations that retard dissipation of
adalimumab from the site of injection are likely to be more effective
and may need to be administered less frequently for the treatment of
localised fibrotic conditions characterised by low-grade inflammation
such as DD. Neutralising antibodies to adalimumab are likely to result
in reduced efficacy [28]. Only one patient, who received 35 mg in
0.7 ml, had antibody levels (12.4±0.63 AU/ml) just above the threshold
of significance of 12Au/ml [22], which are unlikely to be of clinical sig-
nificance. Neutralising antibodies may occur more commonly after re-
peated administration of adalimumab, especially in patients who are
not on concomitant methotrexate.
Whilst almost all patients reported pain during injection, pain scores
immediately after injection were higher in participants receiving volumes
of either placebo or adalimumab N0.3–0.4 ml and in those injected with
the formulation of adalimumab comprising 40 mg in 0.8 ml of carrier
that was used for the 15 mg and 35 mg cohorts. This formulation differs
significantly from the more concentrated form of 40 mg in 0.4 ml in
that it contains a variety of excipients [27], including citrate, which is as-
sociated with higher pain scores when injected subcutaneously [29]. The
40 mg in 0.4 ml formulation was not available commercially when the
trial opened to recruitment and therefore the study was initially based
on dose cohorts using the 40 mg in 0.8 ml formulation. Transient swelling
at the injection site was apparent in some patients receiving 0.7 ml of ei-
ther placebo or adalimumab, most likely due to extravasation of the
injected material outside the confines of the nodule. The safety profile
of adalimumab is well-known and the commonest adverse events in
patients with autoimmune disorders on long-term therapy are related
to infection [30]. One patient in our study, who suffered from type 2
diabetes mellitus received 35 mg of adalimumab developed a wound
infection 4 days following surgery that resolved following removal of
sutures and antibiotics. The infection was considered to be unrelated to
the adalimumab injection as it was a localised suture abscess away
from the site of the injected nodule. Wound infection has been reported
to occur in approximately 3.6% of patients undergoing Dupuytren's
fasciectomy [8].
Unsurprisingly, there was no difference in nodule hardness or size as
assessed by tonometry and ultrasound scan respectively at 2 weeks post
injection. This trial enabled us to optimise the methods for obtaining the
data and analysing them in preparation for follow up studies.
5. Conclusions
This phase 2a randomised trial shows that a single intranodular
injection of 40 mg adalimumab in 0.4 ml in patients with Dupuytren's
disease is safe and leads to down regulation of the myofibroblast
phenotype as evidenced by reduced expression of α-SMA and type I
procollagen proteins. Having defined the most efficacious dose and
preparation and based on these positive proof of concept data we are
now proceeding with a phase 2b trial in 138 patients with early
stage Dupuytren's disease randomised 1:1 to receive 4 injections of
adalimumab or placebo at 3 month intervals and followed for a total
of 18 months from baseline [21]. Our study also illustrates the utility

 of using early stage fibrotic human tissue to elucidate novel therapeutic
targets [18] that can be translated to the clinic.
