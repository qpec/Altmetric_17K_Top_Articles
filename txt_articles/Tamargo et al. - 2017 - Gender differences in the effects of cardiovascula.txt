Although sex-specific differences in cardiovascular medicine are well known, the exact influences of sex on the effect of cardiovascular drugs
remain unclear. Women and men differ in body composition and physiology (hormonal influences during the menstrual cycle, menopause, and
pregnancy) and they present differences in drug pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) and pharmacodynamics,
so that is not rare that they may respond differently to cardiovascular drugs. Furthermore, women are also less often treated with evidence-
based drugs thereby preventing optimization of therapeutics for women of all ages, experience more relevant adverse drug reactions than
men, and remain underrepresented in most clinical trials. Thus, current guidelines for prevention, diagnosis, and medical treatment for cardio-
vascular diseases are based on trials conducted predominantly in middle-aged men. A better understanding of these sex-related differences is
fundamental to improve the safety and efficacy of cardiovascular drugs and for developing proper individualized cardiovascular therapeutic strat-
egies both in men and women. This review briefly summarizes gender differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cardiovas-
cular drugs and provides recommendations to close the gaps in our understanding of sex-specific differences in drug efficacy and safety.

Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of morbidity
and mortality in both sexes.1–6 In the past, the risk of CVD was
underestimated in women due to a misperception that females were
protected against CVD.1–6 Furthermore, women develop coronary
artery disease (CAD) around 10 years later than men and at that
time present a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, so
they were more likely to be excluded from clinical trials.5–9 Even
nowadays CVD are commonly perceived to be a health problem
only for men, leaving women with an inadequate prevention vulner-
able to CVD. However, even when women during the fertile period
have a lower risk of cardiovascular events, this protection decreases
after menopause, so that CVD is the major cause of death in women
older than 65 years of age.1–10 In Europe, CVD cause a greater pro-
portion of deaths among women (51%) than men (42%) overall, i.e.
they kill twice as many women as all forms of cancer combined.1,2
Men and women differ in the anatomy and physiology of the cardi-
ovascular system (body composition, role of hormonal changes dur-
ing menstrual cycle/pregnancy/menopause) and in risk factors,
prevalence, symptoms, management, and outcomes of CVD.11–22
There are also gender-related differences in the pharmacokinetics
(PK) (i.e. the way drugs are absorbed, distributed, biotransformed,
and excreted) and pharmacodynamics (PD) (the relationship
between drug effect and drug concentration at the site of action) of
some widely used cardiovascular drugs12,13 (Figure 1). Thus, it would

not be a surprise that efficacy and safety of these drugs can differ
between men and woman.13–21 However, the reported clinical rele-
vance of these differences in PK/PD is moderate or remains uncer-
tain, mainly because women are underrepresented in clinical trials.14
Thus, current guidelines for CVD are based on studies conducted
predominantly on middle-aged men. As expected, the lack of evi-
dence on the gender difference in the efficacy and safety of cardiovas-
cular therapeutic interventions leads to poor appropriateness.
For these reasons, there has been growing attention of the European
Society of Cardiology on the gender-related differences in the effects
of cardiovascular drugs.1,2,4,13,20 Taking into account these issues,
the aims of this review are to summarize the effects of gender on PK/
PD of cardiovascular drugs; to identify the scientific gaps that exist
regarding to cardiovascular therapy in women; and to improve
the treatment of CVD from a gender perspective. Throughout the
text the terms ‘sex’, which is genetically determined, and ‘gender’,
which refers to the socially constructed characteristics of women
and men (such as norms, roles and relationships of and between
groups of women and men), will be used as synonyms.
Gender differences in
pharmacokinetics
Sex-based differences in PK may arise from differences in body com-
position, drug absorption, plasma and tissue distribution, metaboliz-
ing enzymes and transporters, and drug excretion12–19,23–29 (Table 1).
Oral drug absorption is influenced by gastric pH, gastrointestinal
transit times, blood flow and presystemic gut, and hepatic metabo-
lism. Gastric acid secretion is lower and gastrointestinal transit times
are slower in women, whereas gut metabolism does not consistently
vary by sex.15–19,23–30 A prolonged gastrointestinal transit can
decrease the absorption of metoprolol or verapamil and drugs
requiring an acidic environment for absorption may have lower oral
bioavailability in women and they should wait longer after eating
before taking drugs that should be administered on an empty stom-
ach.27 Formulations designed to be absorbed in the duodenum
(i.e. enteric-coated aspirin) may exhibit reduced/delayed absorption
in women, particularly after a meal.31 However, transdermal absorp-
tion is similar in both sexes.12,15,29
Drug distribution depends on body composition, plasma volume,
organ blood flow, and tissue and plasma protein binding.15,18,24,25 Sex
hormones modulate drug plasma protein binding but limited data sup-
port that these gender differences significantly affect pharmacological
effects. Women have higher percent of body fat and lower body
weight, plasma volume and organ size, and blood flow. This explains
the faster onset, higher volume of distribution (Vd), and longer effects
of lipophilic drugs (anaesthetics, benzodiazepines, neuromuscular
blockers) (Table 2), while the Vd of hydrophilic drugs is smaller, reach-
ing higher peak plasma levels (Cmax) and greater effects as compared
with men.15–18,24,25 Therefore, drugs requiring loading-dosages [i.e.
some antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, lidocaine, procainamide), digoxin,
heparin, thrombolytics] can reach higher Cmax and produce a higher
risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in women.27,29 In patients with
obesity or marked increases in extracellular volume (e.g. heart failure),
differences in body composition may alter drug distribution.29,32
Drug elimination from the body occurs by two processes: biotrans-
formation and excretion. Hepatic clearance is a function of cardiac
output and liver blood flow, which are lower in women, and sex-
based differences in drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters
(Table 1), which play a greater role in PK variability than any of the
other parameter.15–19,23–25,33–39 CYP3A and the transporter P-glyco-
protein (P-gp) present appreciable substrate overlap so that the
increased clearance of CYP3A4 substrates in women might be the
result of their lower hepatic P-gp activity.12,15,17,35–39 Renal clearance
depends on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and tubular secretion and
reabsorption. GFR is 10–25% lower in women, mostly older women,
and drugs primarily excreted unchanged in the urine are cleared more
slowly in women, but sex-related differences in renal excretion disap-
pear after normalization for body weight or GFR.12,17,18,26,40
Differences in body composition and PK parameters may affect drug
disposition leading to differences in drug efficacy and safety. However,
only a few sex-based differences in PKs may lead to clinically relevant
changes in drug efficacy or safety as most of the differences disappear
after adjusting drug dosages for total body weight/size or GFR.29 Sex-
based differences in PK and weight-dosing recommendations may be
warranted for drugs with a narrow therapeutic margin (e.g. antiarrhyth-
mics, digoxin, anticoagulants, antithrombotics, and thrombolytics) to
avoid an increase in the incidence of ADRs.12,15–21,23–26
Gender differences in
pharmacodynamics
Prospective and mainly retrospective analysis of clinical trials
revealed sex-related differences in the efficacy and safety of sev-
eral widely used cardiovascular drugs (Tables 3 and 4).1,12,15–20,23–
29,41 PD differences have not been studied as extensively as the PK
differences and can be difficult to quantify as women are often
underrepresented in trials and differences can be partly modu-
lated by sex hormones [e.g. oral contraceptives (OCs) and hor-
mone
replacement
therapy
(HRT)].41

cardiovascular drugs routinely used in clinical practice. Next, we
shall review several sex-related PD differences.
Antithrombotic drugs
Antithrombotic therapy, including anticoagulants and antiplatelet
drugs, is the cornerstone for prevention and treatment of arterial
thrombosis
(e.g.
myocardial
infarction
and
stroke),
venous
thromboembolic disorders, and the complications of atrial fibrillation
(AF).42 Women with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) have a higher
risk of major bleedings than men, probably due to their smaller body,
older age, reduced creatinine clearance, higher prevalence of comor-
bidities (hypertension, diabetes, renal dysfunction), higher risk of
antithrombotics overdosing, and, perhaps, differences in response to
antithrombotics between women and men.42–45

Anticoagulants
Indirect thrombin inhibitors
In men, unfractioned heparin (UFH) distributes into plasma volume,
which is proportional to body weight, and is eliminated more rapidly;
so, higher doses are required in heavy patients46,47 Women treated
with UFH for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) achieve higher acti-
vated partial thromboplastin time than men, a finding associated with
an increasing bleeding risk, even after weight-adjusted dosing.48 The
main suggested risk factors for bleeding included a smaller body size,
older age, reduced creatinine clearance, higher prevalence of comor-
bidities, and an increased sensitivity to heparin.46,48,49
A post hoc analysis of the TIMI 11A study showed similar PK/PD
profiles of enoxaparin in men and women with non-ST-segment ele-
vation ACS (NSTEMI-ACS).50,51 The meta-analysis of two large trials

Sex-related differences in drug pharmacokinetic parameters
Drug class
Outcomes in females
Anaesthetics: propofol
Plasma propofol levels decline more rapidly in W at the end of infusion
Alcohol
Lower gastric alcohol dehydrogenase activity in W. Higher plasma concentrations in W as compared with
M following an equivalent drink
Antidepressants
Higher AUC and Cmax in W
H1-antihistamines
Slower metabolism and elimination in W
Antipsychotic drugsa
Higher plasma levels and Vd and lower Cl in W. Reduce the dosage in W or increase dosage in M.
Olanzapine is more rapidly eliminated in M than in W
Aspirin
Bioavailability and plasma levels of aspirin and salicylate are higher in W possibly due to lower activity of
aspirin esterase, larger Vd and lower Cl in W than in M. Differences disappear with OCP
Benzodiazepines
Lower initial plasma levels due to larger Vd, and possibly higher Cl, in W. OC reduce their Cl. Higher
plasma levels of free diazepam in W
Beta-receptor agonists
W are less sensitive
Beta blockers: metoprolol, propranolol
W have higher plasma levels due to a smaller Vd and slower Cl. Drug exposure to metoprolol increases by
OC
Renal Cl of atenolol and metoprolol increases during P due to enhanced hepatic metabolism
Calcium channel blockers
Faster Cl of verapamil, and nifedipine in W. Increased bioavailability and decreased clearance of oral vera-
pamil in W compared with M
Digoxin
W have higher serum digoxin concentrations due to reduced Vd and lower Cl. Drug Cl increases during P
Glucocorticoids
Oral Cl and Vd of prednisolone are higher in M. Prednisolone clearance was reduced by OC
Heparin
W had higher plasma levels and APTT values than M due to a lower Cl
Iron
Oral absorption of iron is greater in W than in M
Isosorbide mononitrate
W had significantly higher serum plasma concentrations compared with men, probably due to the lower
body weights in females
Labetalol
Labetalol concentrations are 80% higher in W
Lidocaine
W has a larger Vd and may require a higher i.v. bolus dose than M. Higher free plasma levels in W receiving
OCP, as alpha 1-acid glycoprotein levels are reduced by oestrogens
l-opioid (OP3) receptor agonistsb
Slower onset and offset of action in W
Neuromuscular blocking drugsc
Lower Vd, higher plasma levels, faster onset and prolonged duration in W due to the higher body fat and
lower Vd
Paracetamol
Lower plasma levels and higher Cl in M due to increased activity of the glucuronidation pathway. OCP
increase drug clearance
Procainamide
Plasma levels are higher (30%) in W due to a lower BMI and Vd
Quinidine
Plasma protein binding decreases during P
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitorsd
W present higher plasma levels, probably related to sex-related activity of various CYP enzymes
Statins
Higher plasma levels of lovastatin and simvastatin in W
Theophylline
Metabolism is faster and half-life is shorter in W than in M. Plasma protein binding decreases and the Vd
increases during P
Torasemide
Higher Cmax and lower Cl in W than in M
Tricyclic antidepressants
Free plasma concentrations of imipramine, clomipramine, and nortriptyline are higher during pregnancy
Verapamil
W display faster Cl of verapamil after i.v. administration probably due to the higher activity of CYP3A4 or
lower activity of P-gp; lower Cl in W after oral administration
Vorapaxar
Cmax and AUC are 30% higher in women but no dose adjustment is required
Warfarin
Higher free plasma levels in W

(ESSENCE and TIMI 11B) reported that enoxaparin was more effec-
tive than intravenous (i.v.) dose-adjusted UFH in reducing the risk of
death, MI, or recurrent angina prompting urgent revascularization,
but the benefit was greater in women.52 In the FRISC study, dalte-
parin reduced the risk of death and MI in patients with ACS, but
women showed larger absolute and relative reduction of the primary
endpoint compared with men.53 However, minor bleeding was more
frequent and anti-Xa activity during the acute phase treatment was
higher in women.54 The ExTRACT-TIMI 25 study randomized ST-
segment elevation MI (STEMI) patients with planned fibrinolysis to
enoxaparin or UFH. Women had a similar relative benefit and greater
absolute benefit than men when treated with enoxaparin, despite
they presented higher baseline risk and increased short term mortal-
ity.55 In the SYNERGY study, enoxaparin was not superior but also
non-inferior to UFH across multiple subgroups, including those strati-
fied by sex, with a modest increase in the risk of major bleeding.56
Direct thrombin inhibitors
Clearance of argatroban is faster in women, but no sex-related differ-
ences in anticoagulant response were reported.57,58 In the pooled
analysis of REPLACE-2, ACUITY, and HORIZONS-AMI trials men
and women undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI)
experience similar safety benefits of bivalirudin in reducing bleeding
complications, but women experienced a more pronounced benefit
of bivalirudin in reducing 12-month mortality than men.59,60 In the
ACUITY trial, no differences were observed in rates of 1-year com-
posite ischaemia or mortality in women who received bivalirudin vs.
heparin plus GPI.61 Bleeding complications were higher in women,
likely because of comorbidities, as they were older and had more dia-
betes,
hypertension,
and
renal
impairment.59,60,62–64
In
the
REPLACE-2 trial, female gender was associated with higher rates of
death and bleeding complications in univariate analyses, but multivari-
ate analyses eliminated nearly all outcome differences between
sexes.60,65,66 Similar results were observed in another study.67
Parenteral anti-factor Xa inhibitors
In the OASIS-5 trial, fondaparinux and enoxaparin showed similar
efficacy in reducing the composite endpoint (death, MI, or refractory
ischaemia at 9 days) or major bleeding in men and women with

Outcomes
Alcohol
Higher vulnerability of W to acute and chronic complications of alcoholism
Anaesthetics: propofol
W are less sensitive to propofol. W wake up faster and require higher doses than M for the same
effect
ACEIs
No mortality benefit in W with asymptomatic LV systolic dysfunction
Antidepressants
W respond better to selective serotonin/noradrenaline uptake inhibitors. M respond better to
TCA and MAO inhibitors than W
Antipsychotic drugs
More effective in W. They require lower doses to control symptoms
Aspirin
Higher protective effect against stroke in W and against MI in M. Aspirin is more active in male pla-
telets. Aspirin resistance is more frequent in W
Benzodiazepines
Diazepam impairs psychomotor skills to a greater extent in W. They should be initiated at lower
dosages in W
Beta blockers
Greater reduction in blood pressure and heart rate in W treated with metoprolol and propranolol
Digoxin
W with HF have an increased risk of mortality on digoxin therapy. W require lower doses and
lower plasma levels (< 0.8 ng/mL)
Glucocortioids
Females are more sensitive to the effects of methylprednisolone
Heparin
W had increased partial thromboplastin time, even after weight-adjusted dosing, suggesting an
increased sensitivity
Ibuprofen
Less effective in W
Lidocaine
W may require a higher i.v. bolus doses to achieve the same plasma levels
l-opioid (OP3) and j* (OP2) receptor agonistsa
W experience more pain and are more sensitive to opioid receptor agonists. M require 30–60%
greater dose of morphine and j receptor agonists for the same pain relief
Neuromuscular blocking drugsb
W are more sensitive and require lower (20–30%) doses than M due to a smaller Vd. If a rapid
onset of action is required the dose should be increased in M
Paracetamol
W displayed lower Cl and Vd compared with M. OCP increase drug Cl
rt-PA
W with acute ischaemic stroke obtain more benefit from rt-PA than M
SSRIsc
W respond better than M, being the preferred therapy
Verapamil
Greater reduction in blood pressure and heart rate in W
Warfarin
W need less warfarin per week than M. Doses should be modified to reduce the risk of excessive
anticoagulation in W
Zolpidem
The recommended initial dose is lower in W

ACS.68 In the OASIS-6 trial, fondaparinux reduced the primary com-
posite endpoint (death or reinfarction at 30 days) with a non-
significant trend towards fewer severe haemorrhages in men and
women with STEMI treated with primary PCI, thrombolysis, or no
reperfusion therapy.69,70
Oral anticoagulants
Warfarin is equally effective in reducing the risk of thromboembolism
in men and women and did not pose a greater risk of major haemor-
rhagic complications in women.29,71–73 In five randomized trials, war-
farin consistently decreased (68%) the risk of stroke in patients with
AF with virtually no increase in the frequency of major bleeding.74
However, women had more minor bleeding complications than
men75,76 and they require less mg per week than men to maintain a
therapeutic International Normalized Ratio (INR), older women
requiring the lowest doses.73 Thus, starting and maintenance doses
should be modified to reduce the risk of inadequate therapy in young
females,
and
excessive
anticoagulation
in
elderly
patients.77
Surprisingly, there is little and contradictory information regarding
the possible interactions of OCs and HRT and oral anticoagulants.
Thus, it is recommended frequent monitoring of INR when this com-
bination is used.78
Novel anti-factor II and anti-factor X antagonists
Gender had no significant influence on the PK of rivaroxaban,79–81
apixaban,82 and edoxaban83. Dabigatran exposure is �30% higher in
females, but no sex-related interactions were observed.84–86 Major
phase three trials in patients with non-valvular AF (NVAF) recruited
approximately 30-40% of women.84,87–90 Dose adjustments were
made according to weight and renal function in some trials, which
implies some correction for smaller female patients. There were
small trends towards reduction of stroke and systemic embolism for
dabigatran 150mg84 and reduction of major bleedings for edoxaban
60 mg90 and apixaban88 in women compared with men. An analysis
of RELY, ARISTOTLE, and ROCKET AF trials (17 336 women)
showed that compared with warfarin, novel anti-factor II and anti-
factor X antagonists (NOACs) reduced the event rate in both sexes,
but women suffered significant lower bleeding rates with NOACs

compared with warfarin, while men had similar bleeding rates with
both drugs. Thus, women appear to derive more benefits in terms of
increased efficacy and improved safety from NOACs compared with
men.91 In a secondary analysis of the ARISTOTLE trial, women
(35.3%) had a similar rate of stroke or systemic embolism, but among
patients with previous history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack,
women had a lower risk of recurrent stroke compared with men.
Women also had a lower risk of all-cause death and cardiovascular
death and a trend towards less major bleeding and major or non-
major clinically relevant bleeding than men.92
In a meta-analysis of 13 studies (> 100000 patients) NOACs
appeared to have a similar efficacy and safety compared with vitamin
K antagonists in females and males treated for NVAF and acute
venous thromboembolism (VTE).93,94 However, in another two
meta-analysis women with acute VTE presented more bleeding com-
plications than men when treated with NOACs, although all-cause
mortality was not reported by sex in these patients.94–96 Finally, in a
meta-analysis of six trials women with NVAF treated with warfarin
have a greater residual risk of cerebrovascular accidents/systemic
embolisms (CVA/SE) and an equivalent major bleeding risk, whereas
those treated with NOACs deemed superior to warfarin are at
equivalent residual risk of CVA/SE and less major bleeding risk com-
pared with men.97 These results suggested an increased net benefit
of NOACs compared with warfarin in treating women with AF.
Antiplatelet drugs
Women have longer bleeding times, higher baseline platelet reactiv-
ity, and stronger spontaneous and adenosine diphosphate- or
collagen-induced aggregation and their glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa
receptors are more prone to be activated by multiple stimuli as com-
pared with men.42,98–104 Differences in platelet reactivity may result
from direct platelet effects of sex hormones or indirect effect on the
vasculature. Oestrogens via oestrogen receptor a decrease platelet
aggregation and stimulate prostacyclin and NO synthesis and release
from vascular endothelial cells105–107 and decrease the levels of fibri-
nogen, antithrombin III, protein S, and plasminogen activator inhibitor
1.42,108 Conversely, testosterone increases the production of throm-
boxane A2 and the expression of TXA2 receptors.42,109,110 These
changes may explain why platelets from premenopausal women are
less prothrombotic than platelets from age-matched men, although
post-menopausal HRT does not exert cardioprotective effects111,112
and OCs increase the risk of thrombotic events.113
Acetylsalicylic acid
Low-dose aspirin has been the cornerstone of treatment for patients
with various atherosclerotic disease manifestations.114,115 Its antipla-
telet effect is similar in both sexes when COX-1 direct pathways are
considered, but pathways indirectly related to COX-1, i.e. those
stimulated by collagen, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and epi-
nephrine are less inhibited in female subjects.116 In vitro, aspirin produ-
ces a greater inhibition of platelet aggregation in men, while women
retained a higher prevalence of ‘aspirin resistance’ because of
increased baseline platelet reactivity.98,116–118 In ex vivo platelet aggre-
gation studies, aspirin was less effective at inhibiting platelet aggrega-
tion in women with a history of ischaemic stroke or transient
ischaemic attack.119 Thus, inhibition of platelet aggregation in women
treated with aspirin may be insufficient, and females might benefit
from higher maintenance dosages or the use of alternative antiplate-
let drugs. There are some potential explanations for these gender-
specific differences, including (i) PK differences. Oral bioavailability,
area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC), and elimina-
tion half-life of aspirin are significantly greater in women, probably
because men conjugate more aspirin with glycine and glucuronic acid,
while salicylic acid clearance is higher in males due to enhanced activ-
ity of the glycine conjugation pathway.116,120–122 These differences in
biotransformation disappear in women taking OCs.122 (ii) The role of
sex hormones. The inhibitory effect of aspirin is not affected by
oestrogens,42,123 but it is reduced in orchiectomized males and
restored by testosterone, which confirms its role in aspirin-mediated
antiaggregant effects.123,124 (iii) Sex-related differences in platelet and
vascular functions and disease pathogenesis. Men with stable ischae-
mic heart disease are more likely to respond to mental stress increas-
ing blood pressure (BP), while women exhibit higher platelet
aggregation.125
In a primary prevention trial in 39 876 women, subgroup analyses
showed that aspirin significantly reduced the risk of major cardiovas-
cular events, ischaemic stroke, and MI only among women 65 years
of age or older.126 In a sex-specific meta-analysis of six primary pre-
vention trials (51 342 women), aspirin reduced the risk of cardiovas-
cular events in both sexes.127 Women derived benefit from a
reduction in the risk of ischaemic stroke, without an increase in hae-
morrhagic stroke or a significant effect on MI, cardiovascular, and all-
cause mortality. In men, benefit derived from a reduction in MI, but
there was no significant effect on stroke (haemorrhagic strokes
increased), cardiovascular, and all-cause mortality. However, aspirin
also increased the risk of major bleeding (�70%) in both sexes; thus,
the overall benefit and risk requires careful consideration by the
physician and patient before initiating aspirin for primary prevention
of CVD. In 14 trials enrolling 107 686 participants without pre-
existing CVD low-dose aspirin reduced major cardiovascular events,
MI, ischaemic stroke, and all-cause mortality, but increases haemor-
rhagic stroke and major bleedings in both sexes.128 In subgroup analy-
sis, aspirin use reduced MI among men and ischaemic stroke among
women. Aspirin had no significant effect on CVD in the diabetic pop-
ulation, but reduced the risk of MI among diabetic men.128
The benefits of aspirin in secondary prevention trials are well docu-
mented in both sexes. The meta-analyses of 287 trials, comprising pre-
dominantly studies with aspirin, showed that aspirin reduces serious
cardiovascular events (non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or vascular
deaths) by �25% in high-risk patients although the absolute risk reduc-
tion mainly depends on the individual’s absolute risk without
treatment.129 In 23 trials (n= 113 494 participants) aspirin reduced
(27%) the risk of non-fatal, but not of fatal MI. Trials that recruited pre-
dominantly men demonstrated the largest risk reduction (38%), while
trials that recruited predominately women failed to demonstrate any
benefit.130 Another meta-analyses compared long-term aspirin treat-
ment on serious vascular events (MI, stroke, or vascular death) and
major bleeds in 6 primary prevention trials (95 000 individuals at low-
average risk) and 16 secondary prevention trials (17 000 individuals at
high-average risk).115 In primary prevention trials, aspirin produced a
12% reduction in serious vascular events, due to mainly a reduction of

about a fifth in non-fatal MI; the net effect on stroke and vascular mor-
tality was not significant. In secondary prevention trials, aspirin yielded
a greater absolute reduction in serious vascular events with a non-
significant increase in haemorrhagic stroke but reductions of about a
fifth in total stroke and in coronary events. In both primary and secon-
dary prevention trials, the proportional reductions in the aggregate of
all serious vascular events seemed similar for men and women.
However, aspirin also increased (�70%) the risk of major bleeding in
both sexes to a similar degree. Thus, for secondary prevention, the net
benefits aspirin substantially exceed the bleeding hazards, irrespective
of age or sex, while the balance of beneficial effects and bleeding haz-
ards in primary prevention was less clear.
Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors
In a meta-analysis of 6 randomized trials in >31 000 patients with
NST-ACS undergoing PCI, i.v. glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPIs)
reduced 30-day rate of death or MI at 30 days in males, but not in
females,131 apparently because a higher percentage of men with posi-
tive baseline troponins. Once patients were stratified according to
troponin levels, there was no evidence of a sex difference in treat-
ment response.131 A pooled analysis from EPIC, EPILOG, and
EPISTENT trials (6595 patients) found that women and men obtain
equivalent short- and long-term benefit in clinical outcomes from
abciximab during PCI.132 In the ESPRIT trial, eptifibatide reduced to a
similar extent the rates of death, MI, or urgent target vessel revascula-
rization in both sexes.133
Women had higher rates of both major and minor bleeding after
PCIs than men,131–134 but after adjustment for weight, age, and
comobidities, differences in bleeding between men and women were
non-significant. In the CRUSADE study, women with NSTE-ACS
experienced more bleeding than men whether or not they were
treated with GPIs. However, because of frequent excessive dosing in
women, �25% of this excess bleeding risk is avoidable by appropriate
dose adjustment.44 In STEMI patients, early administration of abcixi-
mab use improved patency of the infarct-related artery before pri-
mary PCI and improved epicardial flow and reduced mortality after
primary PCI in women.135 The frequency of bleeding events was simi-
lar in both women and men.
Adenosine diphosphate P2Y12receptor antagonists
Although ex-vivo studies found that women are more often hypores-
ponsive to clopidogrel, there are no differences in the plasma levels
of its active metabolite between sexes.12,136–138 In a sex-specific
meta-analysis of 5 randomized trials (79 613 patients, 30% women),
clopidogrel reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events in both
women and men.139 In women, the overall effect of clopidogrel was
driven by a reduction of MI; in men, by a significant reduction in MI,
stroke, and all-cause mortality. Additionally, clopidogrel increased
the risk of major bleeding in both men and women.
Another meta-analysis of 20 trials (233 285 participants) con-
firmed that cardiovascular risk (defined as MI, stroke, or cardiovascu-
lar death) reduction with clopidogrel did not significantly differ by
gender. Results for other inhibitors were comparable, although avail-
able data were sparse.140
Systemic exposure of prasugrel and its active metabolite are not
appreciably affected by gender.141,142 In the TRITON-TIMI 38 study
which compared prasugrel with clopidogrel in patients with ACS and
scheduled PCI unadjusted data showed a higher incidence of primary
efficacy endpoints (cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal
stroke, individually and in combination) in women, but this difference
disappeared after adjustment for baseline characteristics.143,144
Similarly, in the PROMETHEUS study comparing outcomes in
patients with ACS treated with clopidogrel and prasugrel, 1-year
major adverse cardiac events (MACE) was significantly higher in
women, but differences were no longer significant after adjustment
for baseline risk.145 In both trials, female gender was the strongest
independent predictor of non-CABG-related serious bleeding, possi-
bly due to some extent to lower body weight.144,145
Ticagrelor exposure was higher and its elimination half-life slightly
longer in women, but dose adjustment is not required.146 In a pre-
specified analysis of the PLATO trial, female sex was not an inde-
pendent risk factor for adverse clinical outcomes in moderate-to-
high risk ACS patients and ticagrelor showed similar safety profile in
men and women.147,148 In a pre-specified subgroup analysis of the
CHAMPION PHOENIX trial, cangrelor reduced the odds of major
adverse cardiovascular events and stent thrombosis in women and
men and appeared to offer greater net clinical benefit than
clopidogrel.149
Beta blockers
Oestrogens and progesterone inhibit the cardiac expression of b1-
adrenoceptors and reduce b-adrenergic-mediated stimulation exert-
ing cardioprotective effects.150,151 Thus, gender-specific differences in
the PDs of b-blockers might be expected.
Women present higher Cmax and AUC to metoprolol and propra-
nolol than men due to an enhanced absorption, lower Vd, and slower
clearance via CYP2D6, leading to a greater reduction in heart rate
and systolic BP during exercise.12,152–155 Drug exposure to metopro-
lol is further increased by OCs,153,156 while increased expression of
CYP2D6 by testosterone can lead to faster drug clearance in
men.12,153 Surprisingly, metoprolol might exert a greater effect on
stress-induced angina pectoris in men than in women in spite of
higher plasma levels in females.157
Some trials found that b-blockers improved survival in males, but
not in females, with hypertension152 or CAD158 or heart failure with
reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).159,160 However, the post hoc analy-
sis of several trials confirmed a similar and significant survival benefits
of b-blockers (bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol) on all-cause mor-
tality/all-cause hospitalizations in women and men with HFrEF.161–164
Similarly, pooling total mortality data by sex from MERIT-HF, CIBIS-II,
and COPERNICUS showed similar and significant survival benefits in
women and men with HFrEF.165 In the BEST trial, the survival advant-
age was confined to women with non-ischaemic aetiology, while in
the ischaemic group, there was a trend for a better survival in
men,166 while the meta-analysis of 5 studies (CIBIS-II, COPERNICUS,
MERIT-HF, BEST, and U.S. Carvedilol) recruiting 2134 women with
HFrEF confirmed a similar reduction in mortality in both sexes.167
These contrasting results were attributed to the fact that b-blockers
were underused in females with MI, the underrepresentation of
women in these trials (<25%), and women were older and sicker
than the male cohort. In a recent a meta-analysis of 11 trials enrolling
13 833 patients (24% women) with HFrEF in sinus rhythm b-blockers

reduced all-cause mortality and HF admissions for HF, irrespective of
age or sex.168 Thus, b blockers should not be withheld from women
with HFrEF.
Calcium channel blockers
Gender-specific PK differences have been described for verapa-
mil169,170 and nifedipine,171 but not for amlodipine.172 Women dis-
play faster clearance and lower plasma levels for nifedipine171 and
faster clearance of verapamil after i.v. administration; however, after
oral administration women showed slower clearance than men,169
which may be attributed to the lower body weight, higher activity of
CYP3A4 and/or lower activity of P-gp compared with men.170,173
Verapamil clearance decreases with age in women, which explains
why older women show a greater antihypertensive response.174 In
an 18-week open study, amlodipine produced a greater BP reduction
and incidence of oedema in women than in men.175 However, major
hypertension trials with calcium channel blockers (ALLHAT,
INSIGHT, STOP-Hypertension-2, NORDIL) found no evidence for
gender-specific differences in outcomes.11 In a subanalysis of the
HOT trial, the incidence of acute MI was significantly less in women
with a lower diastolic BP target (<85 mmHg); a non-significant trend
was found in men.176
Digoxin
A post hoc analysis of the DIG study found that digoxin increased all-
cause mortality among women, but not men, with HFrEF.177
However, another retrospective analysis of the DIG trial reported a
beneficial effect of digoxin on morbidity and no excess mortality in
women at serum concentrations between 0.5 and 0.9 ng/mL, while at
concentrations >
_1.2ng/mL was harmful.178 Thus, recommended
digoxin plasma concentrations should be 0.5–0.9ng/mL in wom-
en.179,180 Similarly, the SOLVD trial enrolling patients with HFrEF did
not find differences in mortality between men and women treated
with digoxin.181 However, in this study digoxin was not randomly
assigned and women represented only 20% of the population.
The increased mortality reported in the DIG trial was related to:
(i) supratherapeutic plasma levels (>2.0ng/mL) due to the reduced
Vd and slower renal clearance in women.25,179 However, no sex-
based differences in digoxin PK were found when actual or ideal
body weight was used.182 (ii) Women present fewer Naþpumps in
erythrocytes and skeletal muscle than men, which may predispose to
fatal arrhythmias.183 (iii) Hormone replacement therapy, because a
subgroup analysis of the HERS trial found a higher incidence of coro-
nary events only in women on HRT treated with digoxin.184 Thus, it
was speculated that progestin inhibits P-gp increasing serum digoxin
concentrations. However, in this study digoxin was not randomized
and women on digoxin were sicker.
Diuretics
Women experience more frequent electrolyte disturbances (e.g.
hyponatraemia and hypokalaemia).185 The Cmax and AUC of torase-
mide are 30–40% higher due to a reduced elimination in women than
in men, which may explain why in the German Pharmacovigilance
Project the majority of hospitalizations occurred in women.186
However, no dose adjustments are recommended for torasemide.
Ivabradine
This is a selective and specific inhibitor of the hyperpolarization-
activated mixed Naþ/Kþ inward If current, the primary modulator of
the spontaneous diastolic depolarization in the sino-atrial node.187
No differences in the efficacy or safety of ivabradine were observed
in patients with stable angina pectoris,188–190 with stable CAD and
left-ventricular systolic dysfunction191 or with symptomatic chronic
HF, LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF <
_ 35%), and heart rate >
_ 70
bpm.192
LCZ699 (entresto)
This angiotensin II receptor/neprilysin inhibitor results in systemic
exposure to sacubitril (inactive prodrug of LBQ657), LBQ657 (nepri-
lysin inhibitor), and valsartan (angiotensin II receptor blocker).193

sartan) are similar in men and women.194 In patients with chronic HF
(New York Heart Association class II-IV) and LVEF <
_ 40% (amended
later to<
_35%), the PARADIGM-HF trial found that the risk reduction
of death or HF hospitalizations remain consistent in both men and
women.195,196
Nitrates
The Cmax and AUC of isosorbide-5-mononitrate are higher in
women, probably due to their lower body weight.197 Thus, dosing
should be based on dose/kg or titrated to the required clinical effect.
PCSK9 inhibitors
Alirocumab and evolocumab bind selectively to proprotein conver-
tase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and prevent circulating PCSK9
from binding to the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on the
hepatocyte surface. Thus,
PCSK9 inhibitors prevent PCSK9-
mediated LDLR degradation leading to a reduction in serum LDL-
cholesterol (LDL-C). Gender has no impact on the PK of alirocu-
mab198 and evolocumab,199 and a similar reduction in LDL-C levels is
observed in both men and women with primary hypercholesterolae-
mia and mixed dyslipidaemia.200–202
Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
inhibitors
Oestrogens increase angiotensinogen synthesis and angiotensin II
plasma levels, but down-regulate renin, angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) activity and angiotensin II type-1 receptors expres-
sion, while androgens up-regulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system (RAAS).203–205 Thus, the premenopausal cardioprotective
effects of oestrogens may result in part from RAAS inhibition12,203
No sex-differences have been described in the PK or the antihyper-
tensive effects of ACE-inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor block-
ers (ARB), and aliskiren.12,19,206,207 A post hoc analysis of an Australian
trial showed a significant reduction of cardiovascular events with
ACEIs in men, but not in women, despite similar reductions in BP in
both sexes,208 but this result has not been confirmed. Hypertensive
men are treated more frequently with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system inhibitors (RAASIs), while diuretics are more frequently pre-
scribed in women.209 The lower use of RAASIs in young women may
be related to their potential teratogenic effects.210–212 However, this
lower use persists in women in all age groups, possibly due to the

higher incidence of ADRs, including renal dysfunction and ACEI-
induced cough.213–215 This gender bias may contribute to persistent
HF symptoms in women.180
Early trials (CONSENSUS-1, SAVE, SOLVD)216–218 suggested that
the reduction in mortality and HF hospitalization with enalapril and
captopril were observed in men, but not in women, which can be
explained by the small percentage of women enrolled.7 However,
the AIRE and HOPE trials found a significant benefit for women, espe-
cially in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in high-
risk patients.219,220 A meta-analysis of 30 studies (5399 men; 1991
women) confirmed comparable benefits of ACEI on total mortality
and the combined endpoint of mortality or HF hospitalization for HF
in males and females with HFrEF.221 Another meta-analysis found a
similar reduction in death, MI, and HF admissions in patients with LV
dysfunction after MI in both genders.222 However, women with
asymptomatic LV dysfunction may not achieve a mortality benefit
with ACEIs.167 The large studies (CHARM, LIFE, ELITE, VALHEFT,
VALUE, VALIANT, OPTIMAAL) showed that ARBs produced a simi-
lar reduction in mortality or HF hospitalization in women and men
with HFrEF.7,19,223–230 In patients with acute MI and LV dysfunction,
the EPHESUS trial showed a trend towards greater benefit for 30-
days all-cause mortality in women treated with eplerenone,231 but
no
differences
were
observed
in
the
RALES

spironolactone.232
Statins
Dyslipidaemia has the highest population-adjusted risk among
women
compared
with
all
other
known
risk
factors
for
atherosclerotic CVD.233 This greater atherosclerotic risk is typically
not observed before menopause when the prevalence of hypercho-
lesterolaemia is lower in women compared with men, even if choles-
terol levels are elevated.5 However, after menopause total
cholesterol, LDL-C and triglyceride levels increase, while HDL-C lev-
els decrease, so that women are at higher cardiovascular risk.234
Despite this evidence, women are less likely than men to have LDL-C
levels < 100mg/dL or to receive evidence-based high-intensity statin
therapy as recommended in the guidelines, although the use of statins
remains low in both sexes.5,235 This could reflect the perception of a
lower risk of recurrent cardiovascular events in females with CVD
despite they have a higher calculated cardiovascular risk than men
men,1–6 although the risk of higher incidence of real (i.e. new-onset
diabetes) or perceived ADRs could drive these differences.236–239
Plasma concentrations of statins are 15–40% higher in women, but
dose adjustment is unnecessary.12,240
In secondary prevention trials, statins are equally effective in
women and men for reducing coronary events, strokes, and all-cause
mortality with no increase
in
non-coronary
mortality.241–244
Interestingly, recent evidence confirmed their beneficial effects in pri-
mary prevention trials in women.242,243,245–249 In a meta-analysis of
27 trials (174 000 participants, 47 000 women), the relative risk
reductions in major coronary events, coronary revascularizations,
stroke, and all-cause mortality did not differ significantly between
men and women, showing that statin therapy is of similar effective-
ness in both sexes.243 The NICE guidelines recommended statin
therapy for primary prevention in people with a predicted 10-year
risk of a cardiovascular event of at least 10%250 and the 2013 ACC/
AHA guidelines recommended statin use in asymptomatic adults
Table 5
Suggestions to improve our understanding of gender differences in the effects of cardiovascular drugs
1. Increase the number of women recruited in all phases of clinical trials
• Include an adequate number of women unless adequately justified or enrol only woman when indicated
• Limit the exclusion criteria to facilitate the extrapolation of the results to the general population
• Gender-specific power calculations should be conducted and published
2. When designing and analysing the results of clinical trials gender-related cardiovascular endpoints should include outcomes important for women
3. Gender-specific PD/PK differences have not been investigated for many CV drugs and the clinical relevance of many gender-related differences
remains unproven.
a.
Preclinical studies should consider sex differences in expression and function of target receptors, both for efficacy and safety
b.
Prospective clinical studies should be designed to better understand:
• Sex differences in the pathophysiology and prevalence risk factors of CVD
• Sex-related differences in the efficacy and safety of cardiovascular therapy and the mechanisms involved
• The role of sex–gender on the PD/PK variations induced by pathological conditions
• The potential interactions of CV drugs with endogenous or therapeutically supplied sex hormones
• All this information should be correlated with the incidence of ADRs
c.
Gender-specific analyses should be conducted and cost-effectiveness analysis should be conducted and published for both efficacy and safety.
d.
Quality-of-life measures should be part of outcomes evaluated by gender
e.
Reasons for nonadherence to therapy and/or interventions should be documented according to gender
4. Disseminate the results regarding significant gender differences in CV drug efficacy/safety
• Gender differences in PK/PD of CV drugs should be part of medical education and should be presented as an intrinsic characteristic of many drugs
• Develop educational programmes to increase awareness of sex-specific differences in PD/PK of CV drugs
• Sex-specific dosage recommendations for CV drugs should be included on their labels
• Provide sex-specific data on drug efficacy and safety in all guidelines on CVD
5. Gender differences in dosing, efficacy, and safety of CV drugs are the first step to design safer and more effective personalized treatments

aged 40–75 years without a history of CVD who have (i) LDL-C lev-
els> 189 mg/dL, (ii) LDL-C levels of 70–189mg/dL, if they also have
DM (moderate-to-high dose statin use is recommended, depending
on 10-year CVD event risk), or (iii) an estimated 10-year CVD event
risk of >
_ 7.5%, as calculated on the pooled cohort equation risk
calculator.251
Female sex and advanced age are recognized risk factors for statin-
associated ADRs, i.e. muscle symptoms and new-onset diabe-
tes.7,236,237,239,252–255 The lower metabolism, body mass index, and
plasma volume and the reduced muscle mass of women compared
with
men,
predispose
to
statin-induced
myalgias.7,236–239,252
However, the risk of diabetes is low both in absolute terms and
when compared with the reduction in coronary events.237,256
Thrombolytic agents
There are no gender differences in drug PK and women with STEMI
obtain a similar reduction in morbidity and mortality with fibrinolytic
therapy as men. However, women have an increased risk of major
bleeding and haemorrhagic stroke42,257–266 probably because women
enrolled in clinical trials were generally older and more often had co-
morbidities, i.e. they were at greater risk, which may partly explain
the
observed
higher
rates
of
mortality
compared
with
men.259,260,266–273 The finding that the increased risk of bleeding can
only be partly reduced by adjusting the dose for body weight and
renal function suggests an involvement of PD mechanisms.264,274 In a
pooled analysis of randomized clinical trials, women with acute
ischaemic stroke appear benefit more from recombinant tissue plas-
minogen activator (rtPA) than men and the usual gender difference in
outcome favouring men was not observed in the thrombolytic ther-
apy group.275
Gender differences in adverse
drug reactions
Women present a greater (1.5–1.7-fold) incidence of ADRs and they
tend to be more severe than in men requiring more often hospital
admissions.7,23,26,36,276–282 Specifically, women have a higher risk of
drug-induced torsades de pointes (TdP), hepatotoxicity and skin dis-
eases, bleeding complications with anticoagulants, platelet antiaggre-
gants and thrombolytics, electrolyte abnormalities with diuretics,
myopathy with statins and cough, and rise in creatinine with
ACEIs12,17,26,36,42,44,61,185,186,237,263,276–282 (Table 4). This is in line with
the evidence that 8 of 10 drugs dropped out from US market between
1997 and 2000 posed greater health risks for women than for men.283
The reasons for the higher incidence of ADRs are unclear, but may
result from (i) increased polypharmacy, as women consume more
drugs than men, including over-the-counter medications and herbal
remedies, which increases the risk of ADRs from drug–drug interac-
tions11,36; (ii) differences in prescribing guideline-based drug therapy2;
(iii) sex-related differences in PD (alterations in drug-target expression
and/or in signal transduction pathways), immunological and hormonal
factors.26 However, sex-related differences can be explained simply
because women present higher drug plasma levels than men due to
lower clearance and/or smaller Vd and if doses are not corrected for
body weight, women are more frequently overdosed than men.18,19
Thus, when interpreting clinical trials, it is important to analyse whether
the dose was given on a mg/kg basis or the same total dose was given
to all subjects irrespective of body weight.
Drug-induced torsade de pointes
A prolonged heart-rate corrected QT interval (QTc) is a marker for
an increased risk of polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias, specif-
ically TdP. Even after careful dosing based on body weight and creati-
nine clearance, equivalent drug plasma concentrations and men-
predominance in the use of class I and III antiarrhythmics two-thirds
of the TdP induced by cardiovascular or non-cardiovascular QT-pro-
longing drugs occurred in women.284–291
Women have longer QTc intervals and female gender is an inde-
pendent risk factor for TdP, particularly when taking QT-prolonging
drugs, as compared with men.286 The greatest QTc prolongation is
observed during menstruation and ovulatory phase of the menstrual
cycle, while shorter QT intervals are observed during the luteal phase
which was correlated with the increase in serum progesterone.292–
295 This observation and the finding that the QT shortens after pub-
erty in men, but not in women,295 suggest that sex hormones can
modulate cardiac Ca2þand Kþchannels involved in ventricular
repolarization.288,294–300 Female hearts show reduced expression of
several cardiac Kþchannel subunits (Kv1.4, HERG, minK, KChiP2,
SUR2, Kir2.3, Kir6.2), L-type Ca2þchannels, connexin-43 and phos-
pholamban.294,296–298 Testosterone increases the rapid (IKr) and slow
(IKs) components of the delayed rectifier and the inward rectifier
Kþcurrents (IK1) that may account for the shorter QTc interval
in
men.288,294,297,299,300
Progesterone
decreases
the
L-type
Ca2þcurrent (ICaL) and IKr.294,297,300 However, in post-menopausal
women HRT did not modify the QTc interval, suggesting that oestro-
gens and/or progesterone did not explain the gender differences in
myocardial repolarization299 and that other unrecognized mecha-
nisms, may be important in determining sex-related differences in the
risk of developing drug-induced QT prolongation.301
Gender differences treatment
There are important differences in the prescription, adherence, and
response to cardiovascular drugs between men and women, but
translation of this information into clinical practice is slow.302,303
A recent study in �30 million American adults found that women
were prescribed more medications than men but were less adherent
(possibly related to the higher incidence of ADRs).1–4,10,11,21
Particularly, women with CVD are less likely to receive preventive
treatments or guidance and treated less aggressively with guideline-
recommended medication than men at similar cardiovascular risk
and are less likely to undergo cardiac procedures.1–5,10,11,304–306
Women receive diuretics more often, but less nitrates, antiplatelets,
lipid-modifying agents, ACEI, ARB, or beta blockers than men even
after adjusting for all known variables.381,307–309 Sex differences in the
treatment of CVD may be related to the gender of the physician
(male physicians used significantly less medications and lower doses
in female patients), differences in physicians’ interpretation of wom-
en’s symptoms and time of treatment with respect to the progression
of CVD.11,304,310 Sometimes the reason is that women are older,
forgetting that they live longer than men. These differences in

cardiovascular treatment and care further suggest the need for inter-
ventions tailored to address gender disparities. An evidence-based
pharmacotherapy in women is therefore auspicabile for women’s
health.
Different gender representation in
cardiovascular clinical trials
Women have been underrepresented in clinical trials, particularly in
early phases, possibly due to hormonal changes during menstrual cycle
and menopause, the influence of OCs and HRT on drug PK/PD, the
fear related to drug administration during childbearing age or lactation,
the underestimation of cardiovascular risk, the misconception of symp-
toms of CAD, and the lower occurrence of outcomes.1–5,8–14,26,305,311
This underrepresentation has important implications. First, it is a key
factor contributing to limited recognition of sex-based differences in
prescription, adherence, and responses to cardiovascular drugs,
thereby preventing optimization of therapy for women of all ages.
Second, quite often clinical trials are not powered to draw sex-specific
conclusions and post hoc analyses are often used or simply data
obtained in men are often extrapolated to women. Because translation
of evidence into clinical practice only occurs in populations adequately
represented in clinical trials, current guidelines for prevention and
treatment for CVD are based on trials conducted predominantly in
middle-aged men.6 Third, inadequate inclusion of female cells/animals
in preclinical research and inadequate analysis of clinical data by sex
might contribute to the lack of reproducibility of biomedical
research.312 Thus, gender-based analyses are essential to elucidate pos-
sible differences in cardiovascular drug efficacy and safety.
On the regulatory end, there are continued efforts by regulatory
agencies to increase the enrolment of both sexes in all phases of drug
development, from preclinical studies to large-scale phase III trials.
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Revitalization Act of 1993
required the inclusion of women in NIH-funded clinical reseach.313
The guidelines for implementation, amended in 2001, required
researchers to address inclusion of women in funding proposals and
stated that phase III drug trials must be designed and carried out to
allow for the valid analysis of differences between women and men
when prior research has indicated that it may be important.314 The
Office of Research on Wome�
ns Health plays a critical role in funding
basic and clinical research to study the role of sex and gender in
health and disease and sets NIH research priorities in diseases, disor-
ders, and conditions that primarily affect women. The Women at
Heart Initiative launched by the ESC highlights the growing burden
and under-appreciation of women’s heart disease and promotes
improved handling of women at risk of CVD in clinical practice.
Unfortunately, inclusion of women and sex-specific analysis and
reporting remain low. In a Cochrane Review of 258 clinical trials,
women comprised only 27% of the population. In 196 trials that
included both men and women, only 33% examined outcomes by gen-
der and in trials that performed a gender-based analysis, 20% reported
significant differences in cardiovascular-related outcomes by gender.315
When analysed by year of publication, before or after 1993, there was
no difference in the frequency of gender-based analyses. In another
analysis of mixed-gender NHLBI-sponsored randomized controlled
trials with primary outcomes of stroke, MI, or death published
between 1997 and 2006 the median enrolment of women was 27%
and only 13 out of 19 studies reported gender-based outcomes.311
Another study analysed the current level of compliance with the NIH
guidelines in 56 federally funded randomized controlled trials. The
median enrolment of women in trials including both sexes was 37%
and 75% of the studies did not report any outcomes by sex.316 Even in
recent large-scale trials with NOACs, women accounted for only 25–
40% of the recruited patients.81,84,87–90
Conclusions
The response to cardiovascular drugs may differ among women and
men because of differences in body composition, PK/PD properties
of some drugs and fluctuations in endogenous sex hormone levels
(menstrual cycle, pregnancy), or the administration of OCs or HRT.
Additionally, women present a higher incidence of ADRs and ADRs
tend to be more severe in women, probably as a result of administra-
tion of fixed doses, not adapted to body weight, leading to higher
plasma levels and potential over dosage as compared with men. The
identification of sex differences in dosing, efficacy, and safety of cardi-
ovascular drugs is an essential first step in personalizing treatment.
Gender-specific PD/PK differences have not been investigated for
many drugs and the clinical relevance of many sex-related differences
remains unproven. This should stimulate basic and clinical research
to better understand sex-related differences in the efficacy and safety
of cardiovascular drugs and the role of sex on the PD/PK variations
induced by pathological conditions. Table 5 lists some recommenda-
tions for the design and dissemination of future CVD trials in women.
Future trials should enrol an adequate number of females depending
on the question being addressed and the design should include the
analysis of sex-specific cardiovascular endpoints important for
women. Cost-effectiveness analysis should be conducted and quality-
of-life measures should be part of outcomes evaluated by gender. All
this information would allow a better understanding of sex-related
differences in the efficacy and safety of cardiovascular drugs and a
more personalized drug selection for CVD prevention and treat-
ment, particularly for those syndromes (i.e. diastolic dysfunction) that
are more prevalent in women. Finally, sex-related differences in car-
diovascular drug efficacy and safety should be part of medical educa-
tion and presented as an intrinsic characteristic of the drugs on their
labels. Nowadays, even among drugs with a greater than 40% differ-
ence in PK between men and women, sex-related recommendations
for drug dosages are not included on their labels.25 Nevertheless, the
most effective strategy to minimize the higher incidence of ADR in
women is the development and implementation of sex-specific phar-
macological guidelines.
