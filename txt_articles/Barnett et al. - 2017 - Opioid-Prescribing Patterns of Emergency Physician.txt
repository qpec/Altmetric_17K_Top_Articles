EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
Introduction 
 
The United States is in the midst of an unprecedented drug overdose epidemic. Drug overdose 
death rates have increased five-fold since 1980.1 By 2009, drug overdose deaths outnumbered 
deaths due to motor vehicle crashes for the first time in the U.S. Prescription drugs, especially 
opioid analgesics, have been increasingly involved in drug overdose deaths.2 Opioid analgesics 
were involved in 30% of drug overdose deaths where a drug was specified in 1999, compared to 
nearly 60% in 2010. Opioid-related overdose deaths now outnumber overdose deaths involving 
all illicit drugs such as heroin and cocaine combined.3 In addition to overdose deaths, emergency 
department visits, substance treatment admissions and economic costs associated with opioid 
abuse have all increased in recent years.  
 
The problem of prescription drug abuse and overdose is complex and multi-faceted. There are 
multiple drivers of the problem, such as provider clinical practices; insufficient oversight to curb 
inappropriate prescribing; insurance and pharmacy benefit policies; and a belief by many people 
that prescription drugs are not dangerous, which is associated with increased use. An effective 
response therefore requires a multi-pronged, targeted, and sustained approach that can only be 
achieved through a coordinated effort among public health, clinical medicine, public safety, and 
other stakeholders. Additionally, because opioid analgesics are centrally involved in prescription 
drug abuse and overdose, the situation is further complicated because of the often unmet need for 
adequate pain treatment. Therefore, any strategy to address prescription drug abuse must also 
balance the legitimate needs of patients and ensure that access to pain treatment is not 
unnecessarily restricted.  
 
HHS has been at the forefront on this issue, working with partners at the federal, state, and local 
levels to implement policies and programs to reduce prescription drug abuse and improve public 
health. HHS routinely coordinates with the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) 
and the Departments of Justice, Education, Veterans Affairs, and Defense on this issue. 
  
Purpose of the Report 
 
This report was prepared in response to a congressional directive (Section 1122 of the Food and 
Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012,4)  to the Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS) to improve the understanding of current prescription drug abuse 
activities and produce a report which provides a review of current initiatives and identifies 
opportunities to ensure the safe use of prescription drugs with the potential for abuse and the 
treatment of prescription drug dependence.

Findings in the Report 
 
Although other prescription drugs are involved in abuse and overdose, the findings in this report 
primarily focus on opioid analgesics due to the significant role these drugs play in abuse and 
overdose. As described in this report, current HHS prescription drug abuse activities fall within 
the following eight domains: 1) surveillance, 2) drug abuse prevention, 3) patient and public 
education, 4) provider education, 5) clinical practice tools, 6) regulatory and oversight activities, 
7) drug abuse treatment, and 8) overdose prevention. Each of these areas contributes to ensuring 
the safe use of prescription drugs and the treatment of prescription drug dependence.  
Although significant efforts are already underway, a review of current activities along with a 
review of the prescription drug abuse literature, identified opportunities to enhance policy and 
programmatic efforts as well as future research are presented. Below are the overarching 
opportunities to enhance current activities identified in this report. 
 
 Strengthen surveillance systems and capacity 
 Build the evidence-base for prescription drug abuse prevention programs 
 Enhance coordination of patient, public, and provider education programs among federal 
agencies 
 Further develop targeted patient, public, and provider education programs 
 Support efforts to increase provider use of prescription drug monitoring programs 
(PDMPs) 
 Leverage health information technology to improve clinical care and reduce abuse 
 Synthesize pain management guideline recommendations  and incorporate into clinical 
decision support tools 
 Collaborate with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers to implement robust claims 
review programs 
 Collaborate with insurers, and pharmacy benefit managers to identify and implement 
programs that improve oversight of high-risk prescribing.   
 Improve analytic tools for regulatory and oversight purposes 
 Continue efforts to integrate drug abuse treatment and primary care 
 Expand efforts to increase access to medication-assisted treatment 
 Expand Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment services 
 Prevent opioid overdose through new formulations of  naloxone 
 
Described more fully in Section III of the report, the opportunities listed above serve to 
strengthen programs and policies to reduce prescription drug abuse and overdose in the U.S. 
HHS has been at the forefront of the response to this serious public health issue and is committed 
to working with our federal, state, local governmental and non-governmental partners to further 
the actions included in this report.

BACKGROUND 
 
Introduction 
 
The problem of prescription drug abuse and its related health consequences is a significant public 
health concern in the U.S.  Drug overdose death rates in the U.S. have increased five-fold since 
1980.5 In 2009, for the first time in the U.S., drug overdose deaths outnumbered deaths due to 
motor vehicle crashes. Prescription drugs, especially opioid analgesics, have been increasingly 
involved in overdose deaths over the last decade.6 Opioid analgesics were involved in 30% of 
drug overdose deaths where a drug was specified in 1999; by 2010, this had increased to nearly 
60% of overdose deaths. In 2010 alone, opioid analgesics were involved in 16,651 deaths – far 
exceeding deaths from any other drug or drug class, licit or illicit.7  
 
Morbidity associated with prescription drug abuse has also increased. Rates of prescription drug 
abuse related emergency department visits and treatment admissions have risen significantly in 
recent years.8,9 Additional adverse health consequences that may result from prescription drug 
misuse and abuse include transitions to injection drug use with resulting risk for infections such 
as hepatitis C and HIV10,11, falls and fractures in older adults12,13, and neonatal opioid withdrawal 
syndrome14,15. Moreover, the economic costs of prescription drug abuse are substantial. It is 
estimated that the abuse of opioid analgesics results in over $72 billion in medical costs alone 
each year.16 This is comparable to costs related to other chronic diseases such as asthma and 
HIV.17,18  
 
The problem of prescription drug abuse and overdose is complex and multi-faceted. The 
prevalence and type of health consequence varies depending on age, gender, race, ethnicity, 
geography, socioeconomic factors, and diagnosed medical conditions. There are multiple drivers 
of the problem, such as provider clinical practices; insufficient oversight to curb inappropriate

prescribing; insurance and pharmacy benefit policies; and a belief by young people that 
prescription drugs are not dangerous, which is associated with increased use.  An effective 
response therefore requires a multi-pronged, targeted, and sustained approach that can only be 
achieved through a coordinated effort among public health, clinical medicine, public safety, and 
other stakeholders. Any such strategy must also balance the legitimate needs of patients and 
ensure that access to pain treatment is not unnecessarily restricted.    
  
Over several years, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has undertaken a 
range of activities to better understand the patient and clinical practice risk factors contributing to 
prescription drug abuse and overdose. HHS is a strong partner in the implementation of the 
Administration’s National Drug Control Strategy and Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention Plan, 
leading or supporting 53 of the 90 action items in the Strategy and 29 of the 35 action items in 
the Prevention Plan. This is in addition to long-standing coordination with the Departments of 
Justice (DOJ), Education (ED), Veterans Affairs (VA), and Defense (DOD), among others.  
These activities have led to the identification, development, and implementation of promising 
interventions and partnerships with a number of stakeholders, and significant advances in efforts 
to reduce the health consequences associated with prescription drug abuse. 
 
Purpose of the Report 
 
 
This report was developed pursuant to Section 1122 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety 
and Innovation Act of 2012 (hereafter, referred to as FDASIA). Section 1122 of FDASIA 
requires the Secretary of HHS, in coordination with other federal agencies, as appropriate, to 
review current federal initiatives and identify gaps and opportunities with respect to 1) ensuring 
the safe use of prescription drugs with the potential for abuse; and 2) the treatment of 
prescription drug dependence.19  
 
The report provides information on current prescription drug abuse activities and future 
opportunities to enhance activities within HHS. A brief review of the evidence to support 
interventions is included where appropriate. Federal initiatives conducted outside of HHS are 
referenced throughout the document, when appropriate, but are not reviewed comprehensively. 
Non-federal activities are not discussed unless they specifically involve collaboration with HHS. 
The findings in the report are intended to help strengthen programs and policies and future 
research on prescription drug abuse and overdose.  
 
Structure and Approach of the Report 
 
Following the Executive Summary, the first section of the report contains the purpose, structure, 
and methods of the report. The second section describes the epidemiology and drivers of 
prescription drug abuse in the U.S. The third section highlights current HHS activities to address 
prescription drug abuse within eight domains: 1) surveillance, 2) drug abuse prevention, 3) 
patient and public education, 4) provider education, 5) clinical practice tools, 6) regulatory and 
oversight activities, 7) drug abuse treatment, and 8) overdose prevention initiatives. In addition,

this section describes opportunities to enhance current activities. The fourth section of the report 
contains conclusions and next steps.  
 
The report is grounded in the epidemiological data on prescription drug abuse. The eight 
domains in the report were selected because they each address specific drivers of the problem. 
Specifically, surveillance is discussed because it is essential for understanding the problem and 
targeting the most heavily impacted populations. Drug abuse prevention, patient and public 
education, and provider education and clinical practice tools are included because preventing 
dangerous or inappropriate use of prescription drugs is the most effective way to avert negative 
consequences such as overdose deaths. Regulatory and oversight activities are leveraged to 
promote product safety and assure that clinical practices occur within appropriate standards of 
care. Finally, drug abuse treatment and overdose prevention activities are included because they 
target interventions to the populations at greatest risk for overdose. In addition, although other 
prescription drugs are involved in abuse and overdose, the findings in this report primarily focus 
on opioid analgesics due to the significant role they play in abuse and overdose. 
 
Methods 
 
This report was developed by the HHS Behavioral Health Coordinating Committee’s (BHCC) 
Prescription Drug Abuse Subcommittee (Subcommittee). Formed in 2010 and co-chaired by the 
Assistant Secretary for Health and the Administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration (SAMHSA), the BHCC is charged with coordinating behavioral health 
activities across HHS and promoting collaborations in five topic areas – prescription drug abuse, 
behavioral health communications, primary care/behavioral health integration, trauma and early 
intervention, and underage drinking and alcohol policy. The Subcommittee is comprised of staff 
from 13 HHS operating and staff divisions20  and is co-chaired by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) National Institute on Drug 
Abuse (NIDA).  
 
To identify current HHS prescription drug abuse activities, representatives of the Subcommittee 
completed a survey identifying activities for their operating or staff division within the eight 
domains outlined above. Opportunities to enhance these activities were identified based on the 
review of current activities and a review of the prescription drug abuse literature. Further, the 
Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Interagency Working Group on Prescription 
Drug Abuse was used as a forum to discuss the current progress of prescription drug abuse 
activities conducted by other federal agencies and to identify additional opportunities for activity 
enhancement. The Working Group consists of representatives from HHS, DOJ, DOD, and VA, 
and meets regularly to discuss progress toward attaining the Administration’s prescription drug 
abuse prevention goals.21  
                                                            
20 Operating and staff divisions represented on the subcommittee include: Administration for Community Living, Agency for Healthcare 
Research and Quality, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Food and Drug Administration, 
Health Resources and Services Administration, Indian Health Service, National Institutes on Drug Abuse, Office of the Assistant Secretary for 
Health, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, 
Office of the Secretary, and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

II. 
EPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRIVERS OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE IN THE 
UNITED STATES 
 
This section provides a review of the epidemiology and drivers of prescription drug abuse in the 
United States. The first part of this section contains an overview of the public health 
consequences, demographic and socioeconomic factors, clinical factors, and economic burden. 
The second part describes the drivers of prescription drug abuse. Understanding both the 
epidemiology and drivers of the problem are critical for tailoring interventions to best address the 
problem.   
 
Epidemiology of Prescription Drug Abuse 
 
Public Health Consequences 
Drug overdose death rates have increased five-fold since 1980. This dramatic increase in deaths 
made poisoning deaths, of which nearly 90% are drug overdoses, the leading cause of injury 
death in the United States in 2008.22 By 2009, drug overdose deaths in the U.S. outnumbered 
deaths due to motor vehicle crashes for the first time. That trend continued in 2010, the latest 
year for which national data are available. (Figure 1) The majority of these deaths are 
unintentional (78.3%); suicide and deaths of undetermined intent account for a much smaller 
percentage of drug overdose deaths (13.8% and 7.7%, respectively).23

involved in overdose deaths.24 Opioids, alone or in combination with other drugs or alcohol, 
were involved in 30% of drug overdose deaths where a drug was specified in 1999, compared to 
nearly 60% in 2010. In 2010 alone, opioid analgesics were involved in 16,651 deaths – far 
exceeding deaths from any other drug or drug class, licit or illicit.25 In addition to opioid 
analgesics, other prescription drugs are involved in overdose deaths. Benzodiazepines were 
involved in 6,497 overdose deaths and antidepressants were involved in 3,889 overdose deaths in 
2010, often in combination with opioid analgesics.26,27,28,29  
 
Morbidity associated with prescription drug abuse also has been increasing. Rates of emergency 
department (ED) visits associated with pharmaceutical misuse or abuse increased 114% between 
2004 and 2011. In 2011, more than 1.4 million ED visits annually were due to the misuse or 
abuse of pharmaceuticals, with 420,000 involving opioid analgesics and 425,000 involving 
benzodiazepines. In approximately 18% of the pharmaceutical misuse or abuse ED visits, alcohol 
also was involved. 30 Substance abuse treatment admission rates for opioid analgesic abuse 
increased six-fold between 1999 and 2010.31 Additional adverse health consequences that may 
result from prescription drug misuse and abuse include transitions to injection drug use with 
resulting risk for infections such as hepatitis C and HIV32,33, falls and fractures in older 
adults34,35, and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome36,37.  
 
Underlying the morbidity and mortality is the large number of people who report nonmedical use 
of prescription drugs – use without a prescription or use for the feeling or experience the drug 
caused. In 2011, more than 14 million people reported nonmedical use of prescription drugs in 
the past year, with 11 million reporting nonmedical use of opioid analgesics.38 Moreover, chronic 
nonmedical use of opioid analgesics (i.e. nonmedical use on 200 days or more in the past year) 
increased roughly 75% between 2002-2003 and 2009-2010 (Table 1). This increase means that

Costs 
The economic consequences of prescription drug abuse are substantial. It is estimated that opioid 
analgesic abuse results in over $72 billion in medical costs each year.40 Other studies estimate 
the cost of opioid abuse to be between $53-$56 billion annually, accounting for medical and 
substance abuse treatment costs, lost work productivity, and criminal justice costs.41,42 This is 
comparable to the costs related to other diseases such as asthma and HIV.43,44 In many instances, 
public payers are responsible for covering the costs of prescription drug abuse.45,46

Demographic, Socioeconomic, Geographic and Clinical Factors 
Discussed below are the known demographic, socioeconomic, geographic, and clinical factors 
underlying prescription drug abuse and overdose. Understanding these factors is important to 
enable the identification of the populations at highest risk for abuse and overdose as well as for 
the development of interventions that target these high-risk groups.  
 
The rate of chronic nonmedical use of opioids among men is nearly twice that of women,47 yet 
more women are prescribed drugs prone to abuse.48,49 Rates of ED visits for misuse or abuse are 
roughly equal among men and women.50  More men die of prescription drug overdoses than 
women.51 In 2010, men accounted for a greater percentage of opioid-related substance abuse 
treatment admissions (53.9% compared to 46.1% for women).52  
 
Rates of chronic nonmedical use of opioids are highest among 18-25 year olds, followed by 26-
34 year olds, and 35-49 year olds.53  Rates of ED visits due to misuse or abuse of opioids or 
benzodiazepines are highest among 21-29 year olds followed by 30-44 and 45-54 year olds.54 
Substance abuse treatment admissions for opioid analgesics are highest for 25-34 year olds, 
followed by 18-24 year olds, and 35-44 year olds.55 Drug overdose death rates for opioids are 
highest among people aged 45-54 years old, followed by 35-44, 25-34, and 55-64 year olds.56 
 
There is significant variation in abuse and overdose death rates by race and ethnicity.  American 
Indians/Alaska Natives and Whites report the highest rates of nonmedical use of opioids and also 
have the highest rates of opioid overdose deaths.57 Whites also have some of the highest rates for 
ED visits and substance abuse treatment admissions associated with opioid analgesics.   
 
Socioeconomic Factors 
The relationship of opioid overdose risk to socioeconomic status has not been well studied.  
People who are eligible for Medicaid are more likely to be prescribed opioid analgesics and to be 
prescribed them at higher doses and for longer periods of time compared to other patient 
populations.58,59,60 Overdose deaths are also more common among Medicaid-eligible 
populations.61,62

Geographic Factors 
In general, the highest rates of death, opioid sales, and nonmedical use are clustered in the 
Southeast, especially the Appalachian region, and the Northwest.63,64 Overdose rates also vary by 
urban-rural county type, based on information from death certificates – with more rural areas 
having higher overdose death rates for prescription opioids compared to urban areas.65,66,67,68,69 
 
Clinical Factors 
Fifty to eighty percent of people dying from prescription opioid overdoses have a history of 
chronic pain.70,71 Further, studies have found that the risk of overdose increases with increasing 
doses of opioids.72,73,74,75 Having a history of mental health and substance abuse problems is also 
common among people dying from prescription drug overdoses. Studies have found that people 
with mental health disorders and/or substance use disorders are at increased risk for overdose 
death.76,77,78 Studies also indicate that people with mental health or substance use disorders are 
more likely to be prescribed higher opioid doses and are at increased risk for nonmedical 
use.79,80,81,82

Having a history of seeing multiple prescribers and pharmacies to obtain controlled substances is 
also a marker of increased overdose risk.83,84 Consistent with overdose risk, having a greater 
number of prescriptions and/or going to a greater number of providers or pharmacies have been 
identified as predictors of opioid misuse or abuse.85,86  
 
The sources of prescription drugs involved in abuse and overdose are a mix of medical and 
nonmedical sources.  Among nonmedical users of opioid analgesics, most report getting them for 
free from a friend or relative; few bought them from a drug dealer.  However, most of the friends 
or relatives got them from a single doctor.87 Among high-risk individuals entering methadone 
treatment, the most common source is a drug dealer.88 Several studies have underscored the role 
diversion plays in drug overdose deaths with between 25% and 74% of overdose decedents 
lacking a prescription for at least one of the drugs that contributed to their death.89,90,91  
 
Drivers of the epidemic  
 
Prescribing Trends 
Coinciding with the rise in opioid-related morbidity and mortality is an increase in opioid 
analgesic prescribing, primarily for chronic non-cancer pain.92,93,94 Since at least 1991, the 
number of opioid prescriptions dispensed by retail pharmacies has increased each year.95 Not 
only has the number of opioid prescriptions increased, the amount prescribed per prescription, 
the days supply, and the cumulative dose prescribed to individuals has increased too. A study 
examining national prescribing trends found the average amount of opioid per prescription, in 
morphine milligram equivalents, increased 69.7% for oxycodone, 69.4% for hydrocodone, and

20.9% for fentanyl nationally between 2000 and 2009.96 Other studies have also documented an 
increase in either daily opioid dose or cumulative opioid dose over time among different 
populations including privately insured, Medicaid, and workers compensation.97,98,99,100,101,102  
 
An analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that opioid 
analgesic sales increased four-fold between 1999 and 2010, and this was paralleled by an 
increase in opioid overdose deaths and substance abuse treatment admissions during the same 
time period.103  (Figure 2) A similar trend was noted for rates of chronic nonmedical use of 
opioids, opioid sales, opioid overdose deaths, and substance abuse treatment admissions between 
2002 and 2010.104 Other studies have reported an association between opioid prescribing, 
nonmedical use, and ED visits.105,106,107

High-Volume Prescribing 
Multiple studies have shown that a small percentage of prescribers are responsible for 
prescribing the majority of opioids. Eighty-two percent of controlled substance prescriptions 
written in Kentucky in 2009 came from the top 20% of prescribers.108 An examination of 
Oregon’s prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) found that 2,000 of the state’s 49,330 
prescribers (4.1% of all prescribers) were responsible for 60% of all schedule II-IV controlled 
substance prescriptions dispensed during a six-month period.109 
 
Multiple other studies conducted confirm the high concentration of prescribing by a relatively 
small subset of providers.110111 Considering there were less than 4,000 pain specialist board-
certified in the U.S. between 2000 and 2009,112 pain specialists represent only a fraction of these 
high-volume prescribers.   
 
General Prescribing 
Providers who are not high-volume prescribers may also contribute to opioid abuse and overdose 
because of a lack of education and awareness about appropriate opioid prescribing. The majority 
of opioid analgesics in the U.S. are prescribed by primary care physicians and internists113 and 
most were not trained in pain management or addiction.114  Further, new formulations of opioids, 
revised clinical guidelines and new information on opioid risks such as increased overdose risk at 
higher doses, have only emerged in the last few years. Without up-to-date information and 
training, providers may be unwittingly contributing to community risk by failing to monitor 
whether their patient’s treatment is improving function, failing to determine whether patients are 
seeing multiple providers, prescribing at too high a dose, and prescribing more than patients will 
use – making medication available for diversion and nonmedical use.  Even when sufficient 
information exists, studies show that some providers do not follow risk mitigation strategies even 
for patients known to be at high risk for abuse.115,116,117 
 
Pill Mills 
The problem of unethical pain clinics, or “pill mills,” was particularly egregious in Florida, 
where over 1,000 pain clinics operated until recently. In 2010, 90 of the top 100 oxycodone

purchasing practitioners in the US were in Florida.118 These pain clinics typically operated as 
cash-only establishments, and providers only performed a cursory physical exam, if any at all, 
prior to dispensing or prescribing large quantities of opioids, often in combination with 
benzodiazepines. Similar problems have been seen in a number of other states.  
 
Emergency Departments and Hospital Providers 
Approximately 10% of opioid analgesic prescriptions for people 20‐39 years of age are written in 
EDs.119 Among people entering treatment for opioid abuse, 13% cite EDs as a source for 
drugs.120 ED providers are often unaware of the full prescription history of patients requiring or 
requesting pain treatment in EDs. Prescribing practices in EDs identified as potentially 
problematic include prescriptions for  high daily doses of opioids, overlapping ED prescriptions 
for opioids or opioids and benzodiazepines, and receiving long‐acting/extended release opioids 
for acute pain conditions.121 
 
Pharmacies 
Almost all prescription drugs involved in abuse come from prescriptions originally.122 However, 
once they are prescribed and dispensed, prescription drugs are frequently diverted to people 
using them without prescriptions. There are instances where pharmacies are dispensing large 
quantities of opioids as part of an illegal distribution scheme as well as pharmacists who fail to 
meet their obligation to determine that a prescription was issued for a legitimate medical 
purpose.123 The majorities of pharmacists, however, are attempting to practice appropriately, but 
may not have complete information to identify illegal or problem prescribing or doctor- or 
pharmacy-shopping. 
 
Insurers and Pharmacy Benefit Managers 
Insurer and pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) policies such as covering methadone as a first‐line 
agent for pain because it is inexpensive, not covering non‐opioid and non‐pharmacological 
therapies, and not reimbursing for screening and risk mitigation activities likely contribute to 
abuse and overdose.124,125 
 
People at High-Risk for Overdose  
Similar to the small percentage of prescribers who prescribe the majority of opioids, a small 
percentage of patients receive a disproportionately large amount of opioid analgesics. A recent

analysis by CMS found that roughly 220,000 Part D beneficiaries, or 0.7% of all beneficiaries, 
were receiving prescriptions totaling 120 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) or more for at 
least 90 consecutive days in 2011.126 Among a large commercially insured population, the top 
5% of opioid users accounted for 70% of the total MME.127 Similarly, the top 1% of workers 
compensation patients receiving schedule II opioids in California accounted for 25% of all 
morphine equivalents.128 A 2012 study by CDC found that on average over 2 million Americans 
report using opioid analgesics nonmedically for 100 days or more in the past year. This group 
likely represents those at greatest risk for overdose.129  
 
General Patients and the Public 
Opioid analgesic use is common and growing in the U.S.  In 2011, over 200 million prescriptions 
were dispensed for opioid analgesics – a nearly 200% increase since 1991.130 In fact, enough 
opioid analgesics were sold in the U.S. in 2010 to give every adult the equivalent of 5mg of 
hydrocodone every 4 hours for a month.131 According to the 2011 NSDUH, approximately 70% 
of people who used a pain reliever nonmedically in the past year say they got the drug from a 
friend or relative – with most saying they got it for free.132 Patients receiving legitimate 
prescriptions for opioids and other prescription drugs prone to abuse may be knowingly or 
unknowingly contributing to prescription drug abuse by sharing medications with people who 
abuse them or not storing or disposing of them properly leaving them available for diversion. 
 
Conclusion 
The problem of prescription drug abuse is complex. Many factors have contributed to the 
increase in prescription drug abuse and its associated morbidity and mortality over the last 
decade.  In general, the data indicate that a small percentage of providers are responsible for 
prescribing the majority of opioids. Similarly, a small percent of patients are responsible for 
consuming the majority of opioids and this group represents those at greatest risk for overdose. 
Further, high-volume prescribers are more likely to write prescriptions for patients who overdose 
on opioids.  Although any strategy must address all of the drivers of the problem, taken in 
aggregate, these data support the need for a strategy that particularly focuses on addressing the 
minority of providers and patients that account for the majority of risk, while balancing the 
legitimate needs of patients for pain treatment.

III. 
CURRENT HHS PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE ACTIVITIES AND 
OPPORTUNITIES TO ENHANCE ACTIVITIES  
 
This section of the report highlights current HHS prescription drug abuse activities within the 
following eight domains: 1) surveillance, 2) drug abuse prevention, 3) patient and public 
education, 4) provider education, 5) clinical practice tools, 6) regulatory and oversight activities, 
7) drug abuse treatment, and 8) overdose prevention initiatives. These domains were selected 
because they each play a role in addressing the drivers of prescription drug abuse and include 
interventions that reach the high-risk populations in the U.S. Moreover, they represent central 
tenets of the Administration’s approach to addressing prescription drug abuse and its related 
health consequences. Plans and opportunities to enhance current activities are also included for 
each domain based on an assessment of current activities as well as a review of the prescription 
drug abuse literature.  
 
1. SURVEILLANCE 
 
The CDC has defined public health surveillance as the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, 
interpretation, and dissemination of data regarding a health-related event for use in public health 
action to reduce morbidity and mortality and to improve health.133   
 
Surveillance data underpins all efforts to address prescription drug abuse because it is used to:  
 
 
Measure the burden of prescription drug abuse 
 
Identify populations at risk for abuse and overdose 
 
Identify new or emerging prescription drug abuse issues 
 
Guide the planning, implementation, and evaluation of programs to prevent prescription 
drug abuse 
 
Identify areas in clinical practice that need to be changed and the effects of these changes 
 
Prioritize the allocation of resources 
 
Provide a basis for epidemiologic research 
 
Inform policy/regulatory decision making.134 
 
Key Surveillance Activities 
 
HHS manages essential surveillance systems that track indicators of prescription drug abuse and 
its related health consequences in the U.S. Primary among these are the  National Survey on 
Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), which tracks nonmedical use of prescription drugs in addition 
to the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco; the Monitoring the Future Survey (MTF) survey, 
which measures alcohol, cigarette, and drug, including prescription drug, use and related 
attitudes among 8th, 10th, and 12th grade students nationwide; the Drug Abuse Warning Network 
(DAWN), which monitors ED visits associated with misuse and abuse of pharmaceuticals and

illicit drugs; the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS), which provides information about the 
national flow of substance abuse treatment admissions; and the National Vital Statistics System 
(NVSS) which tracks deaths based on death certificates filed by states and territories in the U.S.  
 
HHS also conducts and funds surveillance-related research to better understand prescription drug 
abuse patterns, examine clinical practices that may contribute to abuse, and evaluate the impact 
of interventions. In addition, CDC provides technical assistance to over 20 states as part of 
ongoing projects with the National Governors Association (NGA), Association of State and 
Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), and CDC’s Core Violence and Injury Prevention 
Programs in state health departments.  
 
Opportunities to Enhance Surveillance Activities 
  
Opportunities identified to enhance current surveillance activities include strengthening 
surveillance systems and conducting additional surveillance-related research to better understand 
prescription drug abuse and overdose. Proposed actions are to: 
  
 Review current surveillance systems to identify ways to better detect changing patterns of 
abuse and health outcomes, and inform policy decisions and programmatic interventions.   
 Explore the predictive value of potential measures of abuse such as doctor-shopping 
metrics in claims data and other data sources.  
 Examine the role of prescriber dispensing in prescription drug abuse and overdose. 
 Better understand the relationship of opioid dose and duration that increases the risk of 
abuse and overdose. 
 Explore risk factors for addiction among patients receiving opioids for legitimate medical 
purposes.  
 Examine potential unintended consequences that may result of interventions aimed at 
reducing prescription drug abuse, such as a decrease in legitimate access to pain 
treatment.  
 
2. DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION 
 
Preventing drug use before it begins is a common-sense, cost-effective approach to promoting 
safe and healthy communities.135 Preventing drug abuse, including prescription drug abuse, 
increases people’s chances of living long, healthy, and productive lives; improves quality of life, 
academic performance, and lowers health care costs for acute and chronic conditions.136  
 
Research has shown that the most effective drug abuse prevention programs are those that help 
individuals to develop the intentions and skills to act in a healthy manner, and those that create 
an environment that supports healthy behaviors.137 Until recently, there had been little research

specifically examining the impact of prevention programs on prescription drug abuse. However, 
a review of three recent randomized controlled trials, funded by NIH, suggests that brief 
universal prevention interventions conducted during middle school led to reductions in 
prescription drug misuse during adolescence and young adulthood.138 These findings provide the 
basis for future efforts to identify and evaluate existing prevention programs and to develop 
prevention programs specifically aimed at reducing or preventing prescription drug abuse.  
 
Another potential drug abuse prevention strategy is medication disposal. Medication disposal 
programs are intended to reduce easy access to opioid analgesics and other abused prescription 
drugs for nonmedical use.  The increasing popularity of these programs presents an opportunity 
to evaluate their utility in preventing prescription drug abuse and overdose. To date, no 
evaluations assessing the impact of these programs have been conducted. 
 
Key Drug Abuse Prevention Activities 
 
Some HHS-funded drug abuse prevention and technical assistance programs are specific to 
prescription drug abuse prevention, while others focus on the prevention of prescription drug use 
in addition to other substances such as alcohol and illicit drugs. Highlighted below are examples 
of HHS drug abuse prevention activities that have broad reach across the U.S. or strong potential 
to impact specific populations.  
 
SAMHSA’s Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant, Strategic Prevention 
Framework – Partnerships for Success II (SPF-PFS II) cooperative agreements, and the Drug 
Free Communities (DFC) support program (in partnership with ONDCP), are the primary 
sources of funding for state and community drug abuse prevention programs and serve as the 
infrastructure for drug abuse prevention programs across the U.S. In both the SPF-PFS II and 
DFC programs, grantees/coalitions utilize SAMHSA’s Strategic Prevention Framework (SPF), a 
five-step, data-driven process, which includes the implementation of a comprehensive, evidence-
based prevention approach.  The use of the SPF process helps ensure that states and their 
communities work together to use data-driven decision making to develop effective prevention 
strategies and sustainable prevention infrastructures. 
 
HHS also provides technical assistance and funds research to inform drug abuse prevention. 
SAMHSA’s Prevention of Prescription Drug Abuse in the Workplace broadens the 
understanding of workplace-based prevention of prescription drug misuse and abuse and 
provides assistance and resources including occupational-specific screening tools, training, and 
informational products to SAMHSA grantees, employers, unions, and other communities. The 
Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) has provided technical assistance to help 
build community capacity to address substance abuse in the Appalachian Region – a region 
particularly impacted by prescription drug abuse. NIH is supporting research to inform the 
development of effective prescription drug abuse approaches, including resources to help school 
personnel implement policies and procedures to reduce prescription drug abuse, studying the

impact of environmental policies on prescription drug abuse, and development and testing of 
prevention interventions.  
 
Opportunities to Enhance Drug Abuse Prevention  
 
Opportunities to strengthen drug abuse prevention activities focus on additional research to build 
the evidence base for drug abuse prevention programs targeting prescription drug abuse, improve 
understanding of prescription drug abuse initiation, and evaluate the impact of medication 
disposal programs. Proposed actions are to: 
 
 Evaluate the effectiveness of drug abuse prevention programs to reduce prescription drug 
abuse in order to inform the implementation of evidence-based programs. 
 Conduct social science research to understand the initiation of prescription drug abuse 
and to identify risk and protective factors to prevent initiation.  
 Evaluate the impact of medication disposal programs on prescription drug abuse and 
overdose. Evaluations should include sampling to determine the proportion of returned 
drugs that are controlled substances.  
 
3. PATIENT AND PUBLIC EDUCATION 
 
Patient and public education are necessary to counteract a potent driver of abuse – the 
misperception about prescription drug risks and subsequent abuse of these drugs. Studies show 
that teens and young adults perceive prescription drug abuse as safer, less addictive, and less 
risky than using illicit drugs, and that drugs obtained from a medicine cabinet or pharmacy are 
believed to be less risky than drugs obtained from a drug dealer, and that such perceptions result 
in subsequent abuse.139,140,141,142  
 
The evidence supporting patient and public education program is limited but shows some 
promise.  An evaluation of Utah’s public education campaign, “Use Only As Directed”, found 
that the campaign may have contributed to a reduction in overdose deaths in Utah.143  A small 
pilot study testing a patient-tailored, brief, web-based intervention designed to improve 
knowledge of safe medication use, storage and disposal found that such knowledge improved 
significantly after the intervention and that these changes were sustained at follow-up.144  
Additional research and evaluation are needed to inform the development of effective patient and 
public education interventions.

22 
 
Key Patient and Public Education Activities 
 
HHS offers a number of web-based and print materials to educate patients and the public about 
prescription drug abuse. Select examples of these programs are included below. These examples 
were chosen because they have wide reach to educate patients about the risks of opioid 
analgesics or have broad applicability to various audiences.  
 
Among the most wide-reaching, yet targeted educational materials for patients are FDA’s Risk 
Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for extended-release/long-acting (ER/LA) opioid 
analgesics and CDC’s Vital Signs series. Under FDA’s REMS program, drug companies are 
required, among other things, to develop a one-page Medication Guide that is given to patients 
when they obtain their opioid prescription at the pharmacy. The Medication Guide contains 
consumer-friendly information on the safe use and disposal of these medications. Through its 
monthly Vital Signs series, CDC has produced a variety of patient education materials including 
fact sheets, podcasts, and social media tools to raise awareness about the abuse of opioid 
analgesics and other prescription drugs.  
 
Examples of programs developed for a general audience include SAMHSA’s Not Worth the Risk, 
Even If It’s Legal campaign and NIH’s PEERx initiative. The Not Worth the Risk, Even If It’s 
Legal campaign, developed in partnership with the National Council on Patient Information and 
Education, includes a range of educational and outreach messages encouraging parents to talk to 
their teens about preventing prescription drug abuse. NIH’s PEERx initiative reaches out to 
teens, providing factual information about the harmful effects of prescription drug abuse on the 
brain and body and encouraging them to spread the word. NIH also has a Prescription Drug 
Abuse Mind Over Matter magazine developed for youth in grades five through nine as well as a 
number of resources to educate people of all ages about prescription drug abuse, including a 
Prescription Drug Research Report which provides information on the latest research. 
 
The selected programs above along with other patient and public education programs developed 
by HHS  complement those programs offered by other federal agencies such as ONDCP’s 
National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign and the Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) 
Get Smart About Drugs, and public education associated with DEA’s National Take-Back 
Initiative.  
 
Opportunities to Enhance Patient and Public Education  
 
Opportunities to enhance patient and public education include strengthening the coordination of 
patient and public education activities among federal agencies and furthering the development of 
targeted patient and public education programs. Proposed actions are to:  
 
 Convene federal agencies to assure that patient education activities and messaging is 
evidence-based and consistent across agencies. 
 Leverage DEA’s National Take Back Days, International Overdose Awareness Day, 
National Substance Abuse Prevention Month, National Drug Facts Week, and other 
special occasions as opportunities to highlight the dangers of prescription drug abuse to 
patients across the U.S. 
  
23 
 
 Partner with professional societies, patient education organizations, and others to expand 
targeted patient education programs, focusing on the addiction risks of medications, the 
dangers of mixing medications or mixing them with alcohol, and what patients can do to 
safeguard their medications.  
 Work with public and private insurers and pharmacy benefit managers to include targeted 
educational information to beneficiaries receiving opioid analgesics and other 
prescription drugs prone to abuse based on demographics, medications prescribed, and 
conditions being treated. 
 Conduct research to determine the effectiveness of patient education programs and use 
the findings to inform future educational programs. 
 
4. PROVIDER EDUCATION 
 
Education and training in both pain management and substance abuse, especially how to identify 
patients who may be at risk for abuse and ensure patients treated with opioids receive the 
appropriate dose and quantity of medication for their condition, are important to address the 
significant percentage of providers who may be contributing to abuse and overdose because of a 
lack of training in these areas.  Such activities are important to meet the dual goal to reduce 
abuse of and overdose from opioid analgesics and to maintain legitimate and appropriate access 
to these drugs.  
 
Surveys of healthcare providers indicate that they receive inadequate training on pain 
management, and often feel uncomfortable managing patients with pain.145,146,147 Significant 
gaps and fragmentation in pain education in medical schools have also been identified.148 A 
recent study found that primary care providers do not adequately perform or interpret opioid risk 
assessments, resulting in misestimated risk, and that physicians and pharmacists often omit key 
messages about safe use and storage of opioids when counseling patients.149 Education for 
healthcare providers on substance abuse, like education for pain management, is limited. A 
national survey of medical residency programs in 2000 found that, of the programs studied, only 
56% required substance use disorder training, and the number of curricular hours in the required 
programs varied between 3 and 12 hours.150  
 
There is little information assessing the impact of provider education on prescription drug abuse 
or on the best types and way of providing education.  A study in Utah employed an individual-
level intervention to educate providers about opioid prescribing, and found reductions in

inappropriate prescribing after the intervention.151 Another study examining the impact of 
continuing education on buprenorphine diversion found that physician knowledge and practice 
behaviors significantly improved, at least through the short-term follow up, after the educational 
intervention.152 Additional research is needed to help tailor provider education programs for 
maximal benefit.  
 
Key Provider Education Activities 
 
HHS has taken significant strides to improve education across the spectrum of health 
professional training. Discussed below are examples of innovative provider education activities 
that were selected because they stand to change how pain education is taught in health 
professional schools or have the ability to reach a wide and diverse group of providers.  
To improve education among health professional students and residents, NIH’s Centers of 
Excellence for Physician Information has developed five curriculum resources focusing on 
prescription opioid abuse. In addition, the NIH Pain Consortium has selected 12 health 
professional schools as designated Centers of Excellence in Pain Education (CoEPEs). The 
CoEPEs act as hubs for the development, evaluation, and distribution of pain management 
curriculum resources for medical, dental, nursing and pharmacy schools to improve how 
healthcare providers are taught about pain and its treatment, while minimizing the risk of abuse. 
 
HHS also provides a number of educational programs for clinicians already in practice. These 
programs are offered in a variety of formats (in-person, web-based, paper format, etc.) to 
increase access to the largest number of providers possible. Examples include FDA’s ER/LA 
opioid analgesic REMS, which requires manufacturers to make available continuing education 
(CE) courses that contain key concepts on appropriate opioid prescribing. It is expected that 
nearly 200,000 prescribers of ER/LA opioids will be trained through the REMS within three 
years. NIH, in partnership with ONDCP and Medscape, developed two innovative, video-based 
Opioid and Pain Management CE modules that provide practical guidance to physicians and 
other clinicians on prescription drug abuse and pain management. More than 50,000 providers 
have completed these CE courses since they were launched in October 2012.  
 
SAMHSA offers an in-person CE course, Clinical Challenges in Prescribing Controlled Drugs: 
Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. The course, targeted to primary care providers, typically 
provides specific knowledge and skills associated with safe prescribing of opioids for chronic 
pain and clinical strategies for managing challenging patient situations. SAMHSA also has 
partnered with Medscape in developing a video-based version of this course titled Prescribing 
Opioids for Chronic Pain with a special emphasis on methadone.  In addition, SAMHSA’s 
Prescribers’ Clinical Support System for Opioid Therapies (PCSS-O) provides support, training, 
and mentoring services to a variety of healthcare providers on the safe and appropriate 
prescribing of opioids. CMS has also developed and distributed to states a Medicaid Education 
Toolkit targeted to pharmacy staff which discusses drug diversion, prevention, benefits of 
PDMPs, and the consequences for providers and patients involved in drug diversion activities.

25 
 
 
In addition to offering multiple educational programs to meet the needs of a wide variety of 
providers, HHS conducts research to inform future provider education activities. CDC is funding 
an evaluation of a state-wide, community-level response that includes a focus on educating 
providers about appropriate opioid prescribing and overdose prevention. FDA is supporting an 
analysis that examines the impact on prescribing after distributing educational materials to 
prescribers who regularly prescribe high doses of opioids (e.g., ≥ 100 morphine milligram 
equivalents per day) or prescribe opioids in combination with benzodiazepines.  
 
Opportunities to Enhance Provider Education  
 
The two main opportunities identified to enhance provider education focus on strengthening 
coordination among federal agency provider education programs, and continuing to develop and 
refine targeted educational materials for different types of providers. Proposed actions are to: 
 
 Convene federal agencies to further coordinate the development and dissemination of 
provider education programs to ensure maximum reach and benefit.  
 Partner with health professional schools, educational accrediting bodies and professional 
societies to continue development of targeted educational programs to meet the needs of 
different types of providers and practice settings.  
 Evaluate educational programs to determine the most effective programs with respect to 
changing provider behavior, improving prescribing, and reducing abuse and overdose. 
 Conduct research to determine the most effective ways to provide educational programs 
and training to providers. 
 
5. CLINICAL PRACTICE TOOLS  
 
Equipping clinicians with clinical tools, such as ready access to prescription drug monitoring 
program (PDMP) data, prescribing guidelines, and electronic health records with integrated 
clinical decision support can address several drivers of prescription drug abuse.  Specifically, 
such tools can improve care through the rapid identification of high-risk patients, provide 
complete prescription history information to emergency department providers, and convey 
current and accurate information to guide appropriate clinical decision making.  
 
Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs 
One of the most promising clinical tools to address prescription drug abuse are state PDMPs. 
These programs are designed to monitor prescribing and dispensing of controlled substances and 
can provide a prescriber or pharmacist with critical information regarding a patient’s prescription 
history. This information can have a direct impact on reducing a patient’s risk for overdose and 
provide an opportunity to intervene with patients who are abusing medications.  As of July 2013, 
47 states had operational PDMPs.  However, they are significantly underutilized by providers. A 
number of factors contribute to this underutilization, including the cumbersome nature of 
accessing current systems and privacy concerns.153

http://www.pewhealth.org/uploadedFiles/PHG/Content_Level_Pages/Reports/PDMP%20Update%201-31-2013.pdf 
  
26 
 
 
Research suggests PDMPs reduce the prescribing of Schedule II opioid analgesics, lower 
substance abuse treatment admission rates, and result in lower annual increases in opioid misuse 
or abuse in states with PDMPs compared to those without them.154,155,156,157 In a study examining 
the impact of PDMPs on changes in clinical practice, clinician review of PDMP data changed 
clinical management in 41% of cases. Of these cases, 61% percent received fewer or no opioids 
than the clinician originally planned to prescribe prior to reviewing the PDMP data, and 39% 
received more opioid medication than previously planned because the clinician was able to 
confirm the patient didn’t have a recent history of opioid use. 158   Other tools such as clinical 
decision support tools and use of electronic health records that incorporate PDMP and other 
pertinent clinical data show promise for improving prescribing behaviors and reducing adverse 
events.159,160,161 
 
Prescribing Guidelines 
Prescribing guidelines for the use of opioids in the treatment of pain have been issued by various 
medical societies.162 In recent years, a growing number of states have issued guidelines. They are 
intended to help providers identify patients who are appropriate candidates for opioids and 
provide information on treating and monitoring them. If followed and universally implemented, 
including integrating them into EHRs, guidelines may help reduce inappropriate prescribing of 
drugs commonly involved in overdose deaths. There is limited research assessing the impact of 
prescribing guidelines. A recent study of workers compensation patients in Washington State 
found a 27% decline in the mean dose for long-acting opioids, a 35% decline in the percentage of 
patients receiving 120 morphine milligram equivalents per day or more, and a 50% reduction in 
opioid-related overdose deaths among injured workers after introduction of the voluntary opioid 
guidelines in 2007.163 More study is needed to best understand how to implement and 
operationalize guidelines to improve care and reduce abuse. 
 
Key Clinical Practice Tools 
 
HHS is engaged in a number of initiatives aimed at equipping providers with tools to improve 
clinical practice and reduce prescription drug abuse.  These activities encompass systematic

practice changes and technological advancements to facilitate provider behavior change. HHS 
also conducts research to inform clinical practice and the development of tools to assist 
providers.  Highlighted below are examples of current activities that show the greatest promise to 
impact clinical practice.  
 
The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), in 
collaboration with SAMHSA, CDC, and ONDCP, launched the Enhancing Access to 
Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs using Health Information Technology project in 2011. 
This project is designed to facilitate the implementation of technologies that provide timely 
access to PDMP data for primary care and emergency department providers, and pharmacists by 
integrating existing technologies like electronic health records (EHRs), health information 
exchanges (HIEs) and pharmacy systems to securely connected state PDMPs. In addition, a 
resource center, PDMPConnect, was created under the project to serve as a forum to connect 
interested stakeholders and to share information, advancements, and lessons learned.  
 
Expanding on the innovations of the Enhancing Access project, the PDMP Electronic Health 
Record Integration and Interoperability Expansion and the Electronic Health Record and PDMP 
Data Integration Cooperative Agreements, are providing funding to states to further improve 
real-time access to PDMP data by integrating PDMPs into existing technologies like EHRs 
and/or strengthening state PDMP interoperability. Nine states were provided funding for the 
former program in 2011; the latter program was announced in May 2013and SAMHSA expects 
to fund approximately eight additional states. NIH, through its NIDAMED initiative, developed 
a variety of clinical decision support resources and tools for assessing and treating patients, 
including an interactive online (and mobile) drug use screening tool and procedures for 
screening, brief intervention, and/or treatment referral for patients at risk of developing a 
substance use disorder.  
 
In addition, HHS is conducting research to examine the effectiveness of PDMPs,  determine the 
effectiveness of Patient Prescriber Agreements and urine drug testing, and evaluate two state-
wide opioid prescribing guidelines. This important research will improve the current 
understanding of clinical practice tools and help to inform future efforts.    
 
Opportunities to Enhance Clinical Practice Tools 
 
Building on current efforts, opportunities for enhancement include the continuation of efforts to 
increase provider use of PDMPs; leveraging health information technology to improve clinical 
care and reduce abuse; and synthesizing pain management guideline recommendations and 
incorporating them into clinical decision support tools. Proposed actions are to:  
 
 Convene professional societies to identify barriers and potential incentives to increase 
provider use of PDMPs.    
 Partner with EHR/HIT stakeholders to expand the ongoing work of the Health eDecisions 
(HeD) project to identify, define, and harmonize standards to transmit data for use in 
clinical decision support, including incorporating data from state PDMPs, screening tools 
such as Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment clinical decision support, 
and other relevant clinical information.  
  
28 
 
 Work with stakeholders to harmonize the data standards necessary for the interoperable 
exchange of PDMP data with EHRs.  
 Support pilot projects focused on the use of EHRs and health information exchanges 
(HIEs) to improve clinical decision making through real-time access to intrastate and 
interstate PDMP data.   
 Support efforts to integrate clinical tools into EHRs and other electronic media to provide 
just in time information to improve clinical decision-making.  
 Convene professional societies and subject matter experts to synthesize information from 
available pain management guidelines and the published literature to develop a set of 
prescribing recommendations that can be incorporated into clinical decision support 
tools.        
 Conduct research to determine the impact of opioid prescribing guidelines on prescribing 
behaviors and health outcomes such as opioid abuse and overdose.  
 Test the effectiveness of clinical decision support tools designed to improve care and 
reduce prescription drug abuse and overdose.  
 Partner with health information technology developers and healthcare providers to 
validate electronic screening tools and clinical decision support tools in EHRs. 
 
6. REGULATORY AND OVERSIGHT ACTIVITIES 
 
Regulatory actions at the Federal, state, and local level can be powerful levers for behavior 
change among providers and patients. Primary regulatory functions residing within HHS at the 
federal level include FDA’s oversight of drug approval and post-market monitoring, CMS’s 
oversight and management of Medicaid and Medicare, and SAMHSA’s oversight of opioid 
treatment programs (OTPs).   
 
States regulate the practice of the health professions and can foster the implementation of 
evidence-based guidelines for the safe and effective use of opioid analgesics and other 
prescription drugs prone to abuse. In addition, states can enact and enforce laws to prevent the 
operation of rogue pain clinics or “pill mills,” doctor shopping, and other laws to reduce 
prescription drug diversion and abuse while safeguarding legitimate access to pain management.  
 
Through the operation of state Medicaid and other public insurance programs, states can 
implement requirements that improve oversight of prescriptions for high risk patients.  For 
example, the majority of state Medicaid programs have implemented Patient Review and 
Restriction Programs (PRRs), also called Lock-In Programs. These programs require patients 
with patterns of inappropriate use of medical and pharmacy services to receive controlled 
substance prescriptions from one provider and one pharmacy in an effort to improve the 
coordination of care and reduce overutilization of medical services for patients at high risk for 
overdose.   
 
The evidence base supporting regulatory and oversight interventions such as Patient Review and 
Restriction programs, pill mill and doctor shopping laws, and insurer or pharmacy benefit 
mechanisms is limited. Most available evaluations or reports on PRRs report cost savings and/or 
  
29 
 
reductions in the numbers of prescriptions and providers among patients subject to the PRR 
program.164,165,166,167,168,169,170 Washington State provides the most recent evaluation of a PRR. An 
initial evaluation of their PRR showed a 37% decrease in physician visits, a 33% decrease in ED 
visits, a 24% decrease in numbers of prescriptions, and a decrease in total MMEs, from 312 
MME/day to 185 MME/day after enrolling in the PRR.  Total savings associated with this state 
PRR from 2005 through 2012 are estimated at $120 million.171 
 
Policies such as pill mill laws are promising approaches to reduce abuse and overdose. As of 
May 2013, approximately 10 states had enacted a pill mill law.172 No published evaluations of a 
state pill mill law are available, but non-academic reports suggest they have an impact on the 
number of pain clinics and the supply of opioid analgesic, potentially reducing abuse and 
overdose. Louisiana reported a decline in the number of pain clinics operating in the state after 
passage of their pain clinic law in 2005.173  In Texas, prescriptions for the 3-drug combination of 
hydrocodone, alprazolam, and carisoprodol associated with their pill mills declined, but the 
impact on overdoses has not yet been reported.174 In Florida, enactment of their law was 
followed by a 29% reduction in the volume of oxycodone purchased by state pharmacies and the 
closure of over 400 clinics.175,176 Data on 2011 overdose deaths show a decline in deaths 
involving oxycodone and alprazolam, the two drugs most commonly associated with Florida pill 
mills.177 
 
Key Regulatory and Oversight Activities 
 
HHS agencies are applying their regulatory and oversight authority to address prescription drug 
abuse and providing technical assistance to states to improve their regulatory and oversight 
efforts.  In addition, HHS is conducting research to better understand the impact of regulatory 
and oversight interventions. These regulatory activities complement the regulatory activities 
conducted by the DEA. Highlighted below are selected high-impact activities currently being 
conducted by HHS.  
 
FDA is supporting efforts to reduce prescription drug abuse through public meetings, scientific 
exchange, revising drug labeling, and requiring a REMS for long-acting/extended-release opioids

to ensure the benefits of these drugs outweigh their risks. To assist the development of abuse-
deterrent products, FDA published a draft Guidance for Industry: Abuse-Deterrent Formulations 
Opioids – Evaluation and Labeling in January 2013. In April 2013, FDA approved updated 
labeling for abuse-resistant extended-release OxyContin tablets that indicates it has physical and 
chemical properties that are expected to make abuse via  injection  difficult and to reduce abuse 
via the intranasal route. FDA is also engaged in ongoing public-private partnerships aimed at 
improving the science that underlies the use of opioids in pain. 
 
In 2012, CMS implemented a new policy in Medicare Part D that identifies minimum standards 
for plan sponsors to manage the use of opioid analgesics in their prescription drug plans through 
improved drug utilization controls and case management. CMS provided guidance on data 
sharing between Part D plans for patients who overutilize opioids and move from one Part D 
plan to another. To ensure a robust program, CMS continues to develop systems to identify 
beneficiaries who are at-risk for opioid overutilization, follow-up with their plan sponsors, and 
monitor the impact of this program.  
 
In addition, CMS issued a National Bulletin entitled, Drug Diversion in the Medicaid Program: 
State Strategies for Reducing Prescription Drug Diversion in Medicaid, and held drug diversion 
webinars for State Medicaid Educational Coordinators and Program Integrity Directors that 
included train-the-trainer presentations to 164 attendees from 40 states. CMS developed 
prescriber education focused on FDA-approved dosage guidelines and promoted best practices 
for five therapeutic drug classes that have high potential for improper payments and has now 
posted these guidelines on the CMS website. CMS has also developed and distributed to states a 
Medicaid Education Toolkit targeted to pharmacy staff which discusses drug diversion, 
prevention, benefits of PDMPs, and the consequences for providers and patients involved in drug 
diversion activities. 
Under its regulatory authority, SAMHSA provides oversight of opioid agonist therapy by 
reviewing applications for OTPs, and conducts site visits to assess program compliance with 
federal regulations. SAMHSA also is responsible for reviewing physician requests for Drug 
Addiction Treatment Act, 2000 waivers to provide medication assisted treatment with 
buprenorphine for opioid dependence in the outpatient office setting. 
 
To assist states with their regulatory and oversight efforts, CDC conducted an environmental 
scan of seven types of laws – pill mill and doctor shopping laws, physical exam, photo 
identification, and tamper-resistant form requirements, prescription limits, and immunity from 
prosecution laws – among all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Based on the scan, a state 
laws website was developed to provide a state-by-state picture of the some of the legal and 
regulatory strategies that have been used to address prescription drug abuse and overdose.  
 
In addition, CDC convened a meeting in August 2012 with representatives from state Medicaid 
programs, private insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and other experts to discuss current 
practices among Medicaid PRR programs and to develop a set of best practices to help move 
these programs forward. CDC and CMS are now developing a set of technical assistance 
documents to help states implement robust PRRs.  
 
Opportunities to Enhance Regulatory and Oversight Activities 
  
31 
 
 
The primary opportunities to enhance regulatory and oversight activities include improving 
analytic tools to identify high-risk providers and patients, collaborating with insurers and 
pharmacy benefit managers to implement robust claims review programs, and furthering efforts 
to identify and implement effective strategies to improve oversight of prescriptions for high-risk 
patients. Proposed actions are to: 
 
 Convene partners to develop indicators of inappropriate prescribing and patient abuse 
that can be applied in regulatory and oversight settings.  
 Encourage insurers and pharmacy benefit managers to regularly review claims data and 
PDMP data, where available, to identify and address healthcare providers prescribing 
outside of accepted medical standards and patients at high-risk for overdose.   
 Collaborate with state Medicaid programs, other public and private insurers, and 
pharmacy benefit managers to identify and implement robust programs that improve 
oversight of high-risk prescribing.   
 Collaborate with stakeholders to research the effectiveness of insurer benefit designs 
aimed at reducing prescription drug abuse, and pill mill and doctor shopping laws, 
including unintended consequences of these laws.  
 
7. DRUG ABUSE TREATMENT 
 
Although effective drug abuse treatment exists, the majority of people who need treatment do not 
receive it. Primary reasons for not receiving treatment include: inadequate accessibility or 
availability of treatment; a belief on the part of patients that they can handle the problem without 
treatment; not being ready to stop using; and lack of health insurance coverage; privacy 
concerns; and inability to afford treatment.178,179,180 Additionally, healthcare providers often lack 
adequate training and knowledge to refer or treat patients once they are identified as needing 
treatment for a substance use disorder.  
 
Increasing access to substance abuse treatment, including medication-assisted treatment with 
methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone, is essential to effectively address the prescription 
drug abuse problem in the U.S. Because most people do not seek treatment on their own, primary 
care providers are in a unique position to identify people in need and refer them to treatment. 
Studies have also shown that the most effective treatments are those that include a set of 
comprehensive medical, social, psychological and rehabilitative services that address all the 
needs of the individual.181 Therefore, integrating substance abuse and mental health services into 
primary care is a high priority.

Investing in drug abuse treatment is cost-effective. According to several conservative estimates, 
every $1 invested in addiction treatment programs yields a return on investment of between $4 
and $7 in reduced drug-related crime, criminal justice costs, and theft alone. When savings 
related to health care are included, total savings can exceed costs by a ratio of 12 to 1. Savings to 
the individual and to society also come from significant drops in interpersonal conflicts, 
improvements in workplace productivity, and reductions in drug-related accidents.182,183,184 
 
Key Drug Abuse Treatment Activities 
 
HHS provides funding and technical assistance to strengthen the provision of drug abuse 
treatment services in the U.S. These activities include grants to fund treatment services at the 
state and local level, the direct provision of treatment services to specific populations, providing 
technical assistance to states, local governments, and other stakeholders, and conducting research 
to inform drug abuse treatment. Highlighted below are those activities that have broad reach 
across the U.S., target specific high-risk populations, or describe innovative activities designed to 
improve the understanding and effectiveness of drug abuse treatment. Some programs 
specifically target prescription drug abuse, while others focus on substance abuse treatment in 
general.  
 
SAMHSA is the major funding source for state drug abuse treatment through the Substance 
Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant. SAMHSA also funds screening, brief 
intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) programs in states, territories, and medical school 
residency programs in the U.S. SBIRT is a public health approach to identify individuals with 
harmful or hazardous substance use behaviors or who have already developed substance use 
disorders and refer them to treatment.185,186  
 
HRSA funds the direct provision of SBIRT services within Health Centers and continues to 
encourage adoption by including SBIRT as an allowable and reportable service under HRSA’s 
Health Center Section 330 grants. In addition, HRSA supported the development of the 
Integrating Buprenorphine Therapy into HIV Primary Care Settings Monograph and curriculum 
to assist Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program grantees and others to design or refine the delivery of 
public health services that include the integration of buprenorphine medication- assisted 
treatment into HIV treatment services/programs. IHS provides drug abuse treatment services to 
the American Indian and Alaska Native population at its healthcare facilities throughout the U.S.  
In addition, SAMHSA’s Physician Clinical Support System – Buprenorphine (PCSS-B) provides

immediate mentor resources, guidance documents, and training to physicians prescribing 
buprenorphine to patients for opioid addiction.  
 
HHS is providing technical assistance to help improve and expand drug abuse treatment services. 
In conjunction with NIH, SAMHSA developed and funds a network of Addiction Technology 
Transfer Centers (ATTCs). The ATTCs assess the training and development needs of the 
treatment workforce and develop and conduct training and technology transfer activities to meet 
identified needs. The ATTCs have developed and disseminated a suite of treatment and training 
products on the use of buprenorphine with one devoted to use for the treatment of prescription 
opioid addiction.  In addition, SAMHSA/HRSA’s Center for Integrated Health Solutions is 
promoting SBIRT and medication assisted treatment services in health centers and providing 
guidance that can assist other health centers in developing and implementing these services.   
 
Research to improve future drug abuse treatment services is also an important component of 
HHS activity in this area. NIH is funding an extensive research portfolio to evaluate the 
effectiveness of current treatment options, examine how best to provide treatment services, and 
identify new treatments for prescription drug addiction. For example, a recent NIH funded study 
demonstrated the efficacy of buprenorphine for the treatment of prescription opioid addiction. As 
a result, the NIH’s NIDA-SAMHSA Blending Initiative developed the Prescription Opioid 
Addiction Treatment Study (POATS) Blending Product to help treatment providers incorporate 
study findings into their practice. 
 
Opportunities to Enhance Drug Abuse Treatment 
 
HHS has established a strong foundation for drug abuse treatment in the U.S. Opportunities for 
enhancement include continuing efforts to integrate drug abuse treatment and primary care and 
expand access to medication assisted treatment and SBIRT services. Proposed actions are to:  
 
 Partner with professional societies to identify barriers and promote the integration of drug 
abuse treatment, including SBIRT and medication assisted treatment, and primary care.  
 Collaborate with states, national associations, insurers, and PBMS to assure standard 
benefit packages cover medication-assisted treatment and SBIRT, and to develop 
reimbursement strategies that will increase the number of primary care providers offering 
such treatment in a variety of medical settings.  
 Partner with public and private insurers to develop and disseminate materials to inform 
healthcare providers about SBIRT billing codes and other administrative information. 
 Work with researchers and drug manufacturers to develop additional medical treatments 
for opioid addiction and new medical treatments for addiction to other abused 
prescription drugs.  
 Support the development and testing of behavioral interventions for screening and 
treating prescription drug abuse, including interventions targeting youth and pregnant 
women. 
 
8. OVERDOSE PREVENTION 
 
  
34 
 
Overdose from opioid analgesics is a potential risk for patients who are prescribed these 
medications for pain-related conditions and for those who misuse or abuse them. Naloxone, an 
opioid antagonist that can reverse respiratory depression associated with opioid overdose,187 has 
been used for many years by healthcare and emergency medical services providers.  Some 
providers are now prescribing naloxone to patients taking high doses of opioids as an overdose 
risk mitigation intervention. Educating individuals on overdose prevention, including how to 
recognize and respond to an overdose and how to obtain and administer an opioid overdose 
reversal medication, is an important public health intervention to reduce mortality.  
  
In recent years, community-based programs that provide naloxone and train at-risk individuals 
and their loved ones on overdose prevention have been implemented. At least 188 programs 
were operating in the US in 2010.188   A growing evidence base supports naloxone’s use and 
cost-effectiveness to reduce opioid overdose deaths.189,190 An evaluation of Massachusetts’ 
overdose education and nasal naloxone distribution program found that opioid overdose death 
rates declined in communities where the program was implemented.191 
 
In addition to developing overdose prevention programs, some states have passed immunity from 
prosecution laws to encourage people to seek help during an overdose emergency. These laws 
provide legal protection to an individual seeking help for themselves or for another person 
experiencing an overdose. Studies show that people witnessing an overdose may not call 
emergency services because of a fear of arrest for drug use or sale.192 An initial evaluation of 
Washington’s Good Samaritan law found that drug users in Seattle were more comfortable 
calling 911 after implementation of the law.193 As of April 2013, 11 states had immunity from 
prosecution laws.194 To date, no evaluations of the health impacts of immunity from prosecution 
laws in the U.S. have been conducted.195  
 
Key Overdose Prevention Activities 
 
Reducing the number of people dying from prescription drug overdoses is a top priority for HHS. 
In this report, overdose prevention activities are defined as those activities related to the 
education, training, and safe and effective response to or treatment of an acute overdose event. 
Highlighted below are some key activities.

In April 2012, FDA, in collaboration with OASH, NIH, SAMHSA, and CDC, held a public 
meeting to discuss the regulatory pathways available to expand access to naloxone that do not 
require needles or syringes, making them potentially safer and easier to use.  FDA and NIH are 
working with drug manufacturers to support the development of new formulations of naloxone, 
such as nasal spray or autoinjector formulations.  
 
In addition, HHS is providing funding and technical assistance to increase awareness of overdose 
prevention and to expand the number of people able to respond to an overdose, including certain 
first responders not traditionally trained in overdose prevention and response. CDC is conducting 
research to understand the circumstances and risk factors for overdose. NIH is funding a Small 
Business Innovation Research Grant to develop a comprehensive, low-cost, easily accessible, 
computer-assisted training curriculum on overdose for public safety personnel (PSP), including 
police, firefighters and emergency medical technicians.  
 
Opportunities to Enhance Overdose Prevention 
 
Expanding current efforts to improve access to and use of naloxone is the primary opportunity 
identified among overdose prevention activities.196,197 Proposed actions are to:  
 
 Expand efforts to support the development of new formulations of naloxone, such as 
nasal spray or auto-injector formulations. 
 Partner with national, state and local EMS and other first responder organizations to 
disseminate information on the use of naloxone.  
 Evaluate naloxone programs to better understand how and under what conditions it is 
most effectively being used.   
 Examine the impact of immunity from prosecution laws.

IV. 
CONCLUSIONS  
 
HHS recognizes that prescription drug abuse is a serious public health issue in the U.S.  The 
burden of prescription drug abuse not only impacts individuals but communities, employers, the 
healthcare system, and public and private insurers. Addressing this complex problem requires a 
multi-faceted approach and collaboration between public health, clinical medicine, and public 
safety at the federal, state, and local level.  
 
As outlined in this report, current HHS efforts span eight domains that address the primary 
drivers of abuse and overdose: surveillance, drug abuse prevention, patient and public education, 
provider education, clinical practice tools, regulatory and oversight activities, drug abuse 
treatment, and overdose prevention. In addition to activities underway, overarching opportunities 
to enhance current efforts were identified and are listed below. 
 
 Strengthen surveillance systems and capacity 
 Build the evidence-base for prescription drug abuse prevention programs 
 Enhance coordination of patient, public, and provider education programs among federal 
agencies 
 Further develop targeted patient, public, and provider education programs 
 Support efforts to increase provider use of PDMPs 
 Leverage health information technology to improve clinical care and reduce abuse 
 Synthesize pain management guideline recommendations  and incorporate into clinical 
decision support tools 
 Collaborate with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers to implement robust claims 
review programs 
 Collaborate with insurers, and pharmacy benefit managers to identify and implement 
robust programs that improve oversight of high-risk prescribing.   
 Improve analytic tools for regulatory and oversight purposes 
 Continue efforts to integrate drug abuse treatment and primary care 
 Expand efforts to increase access to medication-assisted treatment 
 Expand Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment services 
 Prevent opioid overdose through new formulations of  naloxone 
 
HHS has been at the forefront of the response to this public health issue and is committed to 
implementing a coordinated strategy among its agencies to address prescription drug abuse and 
continuing to collaborate with federal, state, local governmental and non-governmental partners.
