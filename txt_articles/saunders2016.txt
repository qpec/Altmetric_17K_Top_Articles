We report a quality effects meta-analysis on studies from the period 1966–2016 measuring
either (a) lucid dreaming prevalence (one or more lucid dreams in a lifetime); (b) frequent
lucid dreaming (one or more lucid dreams in a month) or both. A quality effects
meta-analysis allows for the minimisation of the influence of study methodological quality
on overall model estimates. Following sensitivity analysis, a heterogeneous lucid dreaming
prevalence data set of 34 studies yielded a mean estimate of 55%, 95% C. I. [49%, 62%] for
which moderator analysis showed no systematic bias for suspected sources of variability.
A heterogeneous lucid dreaming frequency data set of 25 studies yielded a mean estimate
of 23%, 95% C. I. [20%, 25%], moderator analysis revealed no suspected sources of variability.
These findings are consistent with earlier estimates of lucid dreaming prevalence and
frequent lucid dreaming in the population but are based on more robust evidence.

1. Introduction
Dreams in which the dreamer becomes aware they are dreaming are known as ‘lucid dreams’ (LaBerge & Rheingold,
1990). Hearne (1978) and LaBerge (1980) demonstrated that lucid dreams represent an objectively verifiable altered-state
of consciousness when showing participants could signal their lucid state during dream periods using pre-agreed
eye-movement signals. While this shows that certain people under certain conditions can achieve awareness during dream
states, it tells us little about their occurrence in situ among the general public. Knowledge of this is important; if it can be
established that lucid dreaming is a common experience for individuals then this may act as an impetus for increased
research investigating the causes of its occurrence and stimulate a greater consideration of the ways in which the experience
of lucid dreaming may be utilised as a practical tool.
The most recent review of estimates of lucid dreaming incidence (Snyder & Gackenbach, 1988) distinguishes between
lucid dreaming prevalence (the number of individuals experiencing at least one lucid dream) and frequent lucid dreamers
(those reporting one or more lucid dreams per month). In summarising survey data, Snyder and Gackenbach report
‘‘conservative” estimates for lucid dreaming prevalence of 58% of the population with a further 21% of individuals as frequent
lucid dreamers. Unfortunately it is not clear how these estimates were calculated, since the method of analysis is not
described—a weighted mean would be the most likely estimation technique—and we assume that a study reporting 100%
prevalence was omitted from their calculation. Weighted means for two studies (Gackenbach et al., 1987 cited in Snyder
& Gackenbach, 1988; LaBerge, 1985) could not be calculated by us as sample sizes were not reported. In an attempt to verify
their findings weighted means were calculated with these studies omitted, which produced rates of 62% for prevalence and
19% for frequency. Snyder and Gackenbach (1988) do not report confidence intervals for their estimates, which cannot be
calculated via secondary analysis without information of the total sample size (Cumming, 2011). Of concern is the high
variation amongst effect size estimates in Snyder and Gackenbach’s review, which the authors attribute to methodological
inconsistencies between studies and differences in sample characteristics, though they do not subject this speculation to any
empirical test. Since their paper was published statistical methods have been developed which enable a reduction in the
impact of poor methodological features upon pooled effect size estimates. The primary aim of the current study is therefore
to provide an updated meta-analytic review of studies reporting incidence data for the occurrence of lucid dreams, including
additional analyses to identify sources of the variance in outcomes.
One of the potential sources of variability identified by Snyder and Gackenbach (1988) is an inconsistency in how lucid
dreams are defined or exemplified when asking people about their experience of them; unclear definitions have been
demonstrated to lead to participant error that can affect as much as a fifth of a sample (Gackenbach, 1988). Whereas
Green and McCreery (1994) argue that lucidity is sufficiently defined as the dreamer being aware they are dreaming, Tart
(1988) argues for the earlier conceptualisation of lucid dreams as presented by Van Eeden (1913) which requires that the
dreamer has complete memory of their waking life and is able to exert control over aspects of the dream. This latter
definition is problematic because Voss, Frenzel, Koppehele-Gossel, and Hobson (2012) found only 37% of lucid dreamers
in their sample reported they could manipulate the dream. Mota-Rolim et al. (2013) also report only 25.2% of their sample
claimed very frequent or consistent control within lucid dreams. Despite control being highlighted as a key element of
lucidity alongside disassociation and insight (Voss & Hobson, 2015) these findings suggest that control is not in itself a
qualifying criterion necessary to determine whether a lucid dream has been experienced. Tart and Van Eeden’s definition
with its emphasis on control may therefore be useful in differentiating between ‘degrees’ or ’depths’ of lucidity, however
using it as a definitive definition to the exclusion of dream experiences which lack control but retain other characteristics
such as insight and disassociation may provide impoverished estimates of lucid dreaming incidence. Therefore in this paper
the broader definition of lucid dreaming shall be adopted in an effort to provide the most valid estimates of lucid dreaming
incidence.1
Additionally, Snyder and Gackenbach (1988) report prevalence rates are reduced (i.e. false positives are avoided) in
studies where an example dream narrative—a written verbatim account of a dream from the perspective of the dream
experient—is given alongside the definition of lucidity. This approach has been more recently recommended as good practice
(Schredl, Henley-Einion, & Blagrove, 2012) and has been adopted by a number of researchers (e.g., Erlacher, Schredl,
Watanabe, Yamana, & Gantzert, 2008; Voss et al., 2012). Others have asked participants to produce an example narrative
1 Here we focus on the simple definition of lucid dreaming for ease of participant understanding in incidence studies, proposing insight as the principle lucid
dream defining criteria. However the authors wish to acknowledge this is a more complex debate (please see Kühle, 2015; Noreika, Windt, Leggenhager, &
Karim, 2010; Windt & Metzinger, 2007).

 of their own lucid dreams (Gackenbach, Heilman, Boyt, & LaBerge, 1985) which can be used to identify misunderstandings.
Here LaBerge (1985) reports a drop in prevalence rates from 85% to 77% while Gackenbach et al. (1985) reduced their lucid
dreamer sample from 707 to 360 after an analysis of participant-provided dream narratives demonstrated 347 were either
clearly or arguably not lucid.
A third factor identified by Snyder and Gackenbach (1988) is the method of data collection, with the most common
approach using self-report being susceptible to errors common in retrospective recall (Hassan, 2005; Schacter, 1999). Here
the format of the response scale can also be problematic, given that a range of Likert-scales have been utilised for
investigating lucid dreaming frequency, that range from 3 to 9 point scales. Providing a wide enough response range for
participants is important so subtle differences between frequency estimates are distinguishable; Lozano, García-cueto,
and Muñiz (2008) show reliability and validity of psychometric scale responses are directly affected by the sensitivity of
the scale used, with a seven point scale being considered optimal. These are all key characteristics for which the
methodological quality of a study in this area can be judged and must be considered as potential influencing factors on
any final estimates provided.
Additionally, with the introduction of new data collection methods in recent decades the method of data collection was
considered a potential factor influencing estimates, particularly with the increasing utilisation of online data collection
methods (Benfield & Szlemko, 2006). Manual and electronic survey collection methods have been examined for potential
issues of comparable validity and reliability. Studies have found test-retest reliabilities to be nearly equal, internally consis-
tent, with high predictive validity and comparable socio-demographic recruitment trends between the two formats (Banov,
Kongsved, Bech, & Hjollund, 2009; Berrens, Bohara, Jenkins-Smith, Silva, & Weimer, 2003; Lewis, Watson, & White, 2009;
Schillewaert & Meulemeester, 2005; Sethuraman, Kerin, & Cron, 2005; Vosylis, Malinauskiene, & Zukauskiene, 2012) with
internet surveys in some instances providing greater diversity of respondents (Lewis et al., 2009). This indicates that both
formats are generally reliable, assuming the questions posed are valid and participants are truthful in their responses.
Overall the method of data collection used (electronic or manual) does not appear to impact on the type of respondent
recruited, nor does it impact on the quality of data provided by that respondent. To test this assumption, a comparison of
study estimates via forest plot for data collection method was conducted (see Supplementary material) which demonstrated
little difference between a pooled prevalence estimate of online studies (65%, 95% C. I. [55%, 75%]) in comparison to postal
surveys (60%, 95% C. I. [51%, 68%]), surveys completed with the researcher present (57%, 95% C. I. [47%, 57%]) and surveys
where participants were given the measure in person to complete in their own homes and return at a later date (59%,
95% C. I. [29%, 87%]). Thus despite online studies on the whole providing higher pooled estimates, the degree of overlap with
estimates of other methods highlights this is not a factor pertinent to a quality-assessment criterion. Information regarding
each studies data collection method is provided in Table 1.
The current meta-analysis further provides an opportunity to identify participant characteristics associated with the
propensity to experience lucid dreams. It has been found that children and adolescents report dreaming lucidly more often
than other age groups (Blackmore, 1984; Palmer, 1979; Schredl & Erlacher, 2004, 2011; Voss et al., 2012; Watson, 2001). In
an effort to explain this Voss et al. (2012) proposed the brain maturation hypothesis, postulating that lucid dreaming is a
disassociated, hybrid neurobiological state which occurs as an epiphenomenon of the brain’s natural maturation processes,
such that higher frequency of lucid dreams would be reported from adolescence until the early years of adulthood at which
point frequency would decline for the majority of people.
Additionally, it has been suggested that lucid dreaming represents a specialised form of mental imagery. Mental imagery
can be defined as ‘‘a symbolic sensory experience that may occur in any sensory mode” (Hardy, Jones, & Gould, 1996). Lucid
dreaming has been linked to waking imagery vividness as measured by the Betts Inventory (Gackenbach, Prill, & Westrom,
1983), to visual and auditory imagery (Hearne, 1983), to gustatory, kinaesthetic, olfactory and tactile waking imagery tasks
(Kueny, 1985), and also has some overlap with the mental training of motor-imagery, as commonly experienced by
professional athletes (Erlacher & Schredl, 2008, 2010; Tholey, 1990). Motor-imagery (the mental rehearsal of physical skills,
without the motor-execution of the actions involved) is the variant of mental imagery most frequently applied to sports and
the frequency with which sports professionals utilise these techniques is shown to be between 70% and 90% (Cumming &
Hall, 2002) making many athletes adept at mental imagery. Athletes may therefore be more likely to experience lucid
dreams due to their regular immersion in imaginary environments as an aspect of their day-to-day training. Furthermore,
athletes may receive practical gains from lucid dreaming experiences, an online survey found 21.3% of 301 frequent lucid
dreamers report utilising their lucidity to practise waking skills (Schädlich & Erlacher, 2012). Exploratory research has also
shown lucid dreaming practice may improve waking task performance (Erlacher & Schredl, 2010; Stumbrys, Erlacher, &
Schredl, 2016). This evidence implies that actions performed within lucid dreams correspond to physiological arousal within
the body, supporting the notion of some shared central neural structures between imagined, dreamed and executed motor
actions (Erlacher & Schredl, 2008). Athletes may therefore be particularly motivated to cultivate lucidity for the practical
benefits it potentially provides. They also possess the necessary commitment levels and mental toughness (Crust, 2007)
to succeed in their sport professionally, which may make them cognitively well equipped to succeed in the application of
lucid dreaming induction techniques.
Culture, as the shared beliefs, attitudes, norms, role perceptions and values of a group of individuals (Triandis, 2002) may
also have an influence on lucid dreaming incidence. Differences in dream content (Nielsen et al., 2003; Schredl, Ciric, Gotz, &
Wittmann, 2004; Yu, 2008) and its interpretation (Spaulding, 1981; Lohmann & Dahl, 2014) have been observed between
cultures. An individual belonging to a culture that ascribes importance to dreams may spend a greater amount of time

199
 recording and reflecting upon them; important prerequisites of high dream recall (Condron, 1994), and subsequently dream
lucidity (LaBerge & Rheingold, 1990). Cultural awareness of lucid dreaming may also determine whether a lucid dream is
correctly identified. For example, racial differences in lucid dreaming frequency between African-American and Caucasian
participants have been reported by Palmer (1979). Erlacher et al. (2008) also highlights clear differences in incidence
estimates for Japanese and Chinese samples when compared with European samples. Furthermore similarities have been
drawn between the phenomenal aspects of lucid dreams, out-of-the-body experiences (Levitan & LaBerge, 1991) alien
abductions and near death experiences (Gackenbach, 1991). In some cases individuals may incorrectly interpret a lucid
dream as one of these experiences due to a limited knowledge of dream lucidity. This is not to say that the associated
experiences above can be comprehensively explained as misinterpreted lucid dreams (see Gackenbach, 1991; Rogo, 1978,
1985; Salley, 1986) but may provide an explanation for some of the variance between sample estimates.
Culture may also play a role in the engagement in/avoidance of activities associated with lucidity (Laughlin, 2011;
Lohmann & Dahl, 2014). Certain meditative states, such as mindfulness meditation, share commonalities with lucid
dreaming, where attention is focused upon one’s current state of consciousness (Kühle, 2015; Pagal, 2014; Schredl, 2010).
Hunt (1987, 1989) argues that lucid dreaming contains elements of detached receptivity and enhanced self-awareness
reflective of the desired goals of meditative practice. Drawing on his own lucid experiences, and those of Gillespie (1984),
Sparrow (1976) and Van Eeden (1913), Hunt argues lucid dreams and meditation both correspond closely in their
experiential qualities. In addition, eastern spiritual traditions which address lucid dreaming, such as the practices of ‘‘dream
yoga” or ‘‘Milam” in Tibetan Buddhism (Chang, 1963; Wangyal, 1998) ‘‘dream witnessing” from Hindu transcendental
meditative practice (Alexander, Cranson, Boyer, & Orme-Johnson, 1986) and the Dzogchen meditative approach of Zen
Buddhism (Pagal, 2014), provide practitioners with the tools for experiencing lucid dreams as a meditative technique to
attain spiritual growth. Lucid dreaming frequency and degree of meditational practice have been shown to be significantly
related (Gackenbach, 1990; Gackenbach, Cranson, & Alexander, 1986; Hunt, 1987, 1991; Hunt & McLeod, 1984; Reed, 1981)
strengthening the proposed correspondences between the two experiences. Therefore individuals from cultures where med-
itative practice is widespread may be more inclined to induce lucid dream experiences (however, see Gackenbach, 1978).

 Additionally, cultures where video-games are popular may also have higher reported lucid dreaming prevalence and
frequency rates, as frequent video game play has been associated with lucid dreaming incidence (Gackenbach, 2006,
2009; Gackenbach & Kuruvilla, 2008). Gackenbach and Hunt (2014) have proposed this may be due to significant parallels
between game play and meditation and ultimately lucid dreaming. Lucid dreaming and video-game play are both grounded
in similar spatial skills (Gackenbach et al., 1985; Greenfield, Brannon, & Lohr, 1996), require resilience to motion sensitivity
(Gackenbach, 1982; Gackenbach, Snyder, Rokes, & Sachau, 1986; Preston, 2007) and focused attention (Gackenbach &
Bosveld, 1989; Maynard, Subrahmanyam, & Greenfield, 2005). Gackenbach and Hunt (2014) classify individuals as
‘‘hard-core” gamers if they play video games an average of several times a week, typically for periods of over two hours,
if they have played video games since or prior to the third grade and have played a total of 50 or more video games over
their lifetime. These hard-core gamers have a familiarity with waking immersion in virtual worlds (Calleja, 2007) which
may transfer to their dream virtual worlds (Schredl, 2003) leading to an increased likelihood of experiencing lucid dreams.
Any contemporary review of the incidence literature must utilise methods that take methodological quality and
participant characteristics into consideration in order to present robust estimates of lucid dreaming incidence. An updated
review, incorporating all available incidence studies (including several studies that were overlooked in the 1988 review:
Blackmore, 1982a, 1983, 1984, 1985; Green, 1966) and utilising the meta-analytic method (Glass, 1976) is necessary.
Meta-analysis aims to pool results of primary studies to provide a quantitative review of existing empirical evidence. The
most frequently used method in psychology is the random effects meta-analysis, but this is considered inappropriate for syn-
thesising studies that vary in methodological quality, because they can result in as biased pooled estimates and associated
confidence intervals (Khalaf, Thalib, & Doi, 2011). The Quality-Effects model (Doi & Thalib, 2008, 2009) attempts to avoid this
biasing of the pooled estimate by taking individual studies’ methodological quality into account when calculating statistical
parameters. This makes the quality effects model more appropriate for the current purpose, where clear differences in study
methodological quality appear to have an influence upon a study’s final estimate. Additionally, effect size estimates collected
across studies from either the same participants, same settings or same researchers are commonly found to correlate and can
have an inflationary influence on the effect size average (Malle, 2006). As several researchers have published more than one
study in the current review, authors are to be incorporated as a moderator variable, grouping studies from the same
researcher together so that potential systematic biases in reported results can be identified.
The aim of the present study is therefore to conduct a quality effects meta-analysis of the self-reported rates of lucid
dreaming incidence for frequent lucid dreamer prevalence. Study methodological quality shall be assessed and reflected
in the weights ascribed to each study estimate. In addition, three moderator variables will be investigated as potential
sources of heterogeneity: participant characteristics, nationality and researchers contributing more than one study. For
estimates of both lucid dreaming prevalence and frequent lucid dreaming, it is expected that samples with children, athlete
and video gamer participant characteristics will report higher estimates of lucid dreaming than other participant
characteristic groups. Potential cultural differences on the basis of participant nationality for lucid dreaming incidence will
also be explored.
2. Method
2.1. Search strategy
A search for studies investigating lucid dreaming incidence was conducted. No publication date restrictions were applied,
thus identified studies ranged from 1966 to 2016. Computer-based literature indexes were searched (PsychNET, Swetswise,
Lexscien, IngentaConnect and WebofScience) using a combination of lucid dreaming specific terms. The terms Lucid⁄ AND
Dreaming⁄ OR Dream⁄ were searched, as well as terms relating to associated experiences which have been investigated in
combination with lucid dreams (e.g. OBE⁄ OR Altered-state⁄ OR ASC⁄ OR NDE⁄). Terms directly related to the occurrence of
lucidity (Incidence⁄ OR Prevalence⁄ OR Frequency⁄) and terms of common research methodologies (e.g. Survey⁄ OR
Collection⁄ OR Self-Report⁄) were also searched. Identified abstracts were read to assess a paper’s relevance before moving
to a careful hand search of appropriate reference lists, books and other relevant resources. Once these sources were
exhausted correspondence was attempted with all primary authors to identify grey literature on the topic, see Fig. 1 for a
flow diagram of the identification process.
2.2. Inclusion/Exclusion criteria
For inclusion in the meta-analysis, studies had to meet the following criteria: (1) Studies provided at least one measure of
lucid dreaming incidence. (2) Studies were written in English. (3) Data collection was by self-report measure or interview. (4)
Studies did not select participants on the basis of pre-determined characteristics such as high dream recall frequency or
experience of lucid dreaming. Of the initial 679 papers identified, 653 were not relevant, did not meet inclusion criteria
or lacked sufficient details to allow proportions to be calculated. A further 9 papers were identified through hand searching
and these were augmented by a further six ‘grey literature’ studies provided via e-mail correspondence sent to every author
who had published a study included in the review, requesting any unpublished manuscripts/data. Seven papers were then
rejected due to failing to meet the inclusion criteria or lack of detail, leaving a total of 34 papers included in the analysis.

 2.3. Data extraction
Data on sample nationality; the definition of lucidity used; sampling method; sample size; measurement protocol;
measurement instrument; measurement of moderators; methodological controls and relevant participant characteristics
were taken from every study included in the meta-analysis. When reporting for any of the above was unclear
correspondence with the authors was attempted for clarification.
2.4. Quality assessment and coding procedure
No available scale was appropriate for the task of assessing methodological quality; two of the most effective quality
assessment scales (Deeks et al., 2003) the Downs and Black scale (Downs & Black, 1998) and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale
(Wells et al., 2014), lacked items which sufficiently addressed internal validity dimensions relevant to the lucid dreaming
incidence literature. Therefore a 12-item scale, the Lucid Dreaming Incidence Methodological Quality inventory (LDIM-Qi)
was devised with questions addressing the three broad dimensions of reporting quality, external validity and internal
validity (see Appendix A). The total available points on this scale are 18 with the majority of questions being scored 0 or
1. Questions 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 & 12 have a maximum score of two, with one point being awarded for limited coverage. Items
within the reporting and external validity subsections are general and concern clarity of hypothesis/aims/objectives,
representativeness of sample, etc. The internal validity scale considers specific issues, devised from a consideration of the
methodological differences that exist between studies and the relative impact these may have on the accuracy of findings.
Quality scoring for the studies was completed by the primary author, then a random selection of studies were assessed by
a second, blinded judge, these scores were then correlated. The degree of correspondence between judges was shown by a
Spearman’s ranked correlation coefficient (rs = 0.928, 95% C. I. [0.80, 0.97] p < .001, n = 17). Please see the Supplementary
material of this paper for Qi scores for each study.
Once studies were scored on the quality assessment measure separate quality effects analyses were run for studies
reporting rates of either lucid dreaming prevalence or frequent lucid dreaming, studies reporting both appear in both
analyses. Potential sources of heterogeneity were investigated by the arrangement of studies into groups dependent on
the

 3. Results
The final sample included 34 studies spanning five decades of research with a total n of 24,282 comprised of differing
sample types (student n = 3355; representative = 7300; children = 4162; interest groups (individuals who have engaged with
the research due to an explicit interest in the topic area) = 6252; Research groups (samples comprising individuals belonging
to research societies such as the Society for Psychical Research; the Association for Research and Enlightenment) = 886;
Athletes = 2235;
Video
gamers = 92).
These
participants
also
represented
diverse
nationalities
(British = 6393;
Brazilian = 3427;
German = 3190;
American = 1842;
Japanese = 1476;
Austrian = 1000;
Spanish = 254;
Chinese = 348;
Swiss = 214; Dutch = 189) the remaining 5949 participants were from online survey studies where no data for nationality
was collected/reported (Hess, Schredl, & Göritz, 2016; Schredl, Berres, Klingauf, Schellhaas, & Göritz, 2014; Stumbrys,
Erlacher, & Malinowski, 2015). Simple means for lucid dreaming prevalence and frequent lucid dreamers are reported in
Table 1 as 63.25% and 23.27% respectively. Alongside this data collection method, sample characteristics, participant
nationality and final Quality index score (Qi) ranging from 0 (meeting no methodological quality criteria) to 1 (fully meeting
all criteria) is provided for each included study. The mean overall Qi score is shown as 0.46, in order to assess if study quality
improved over time, a Spearman’s correlation was conducted between year of publication and Qi score, this was shown as
non-significant (rs = 0.146, p = 0.409, n = 34) suggesting study quality has not improved significantly over time.
3.1. Lucid dreaming prevalence
Estimates of lucid dreaming prevalence were reported by all 34 studies (see Table 1). The quality effects meta-analysis of
these studies give a pooled estimate of 59.48%, 95% C. I. [51%, 67%] with estimates ranging from 26% to 92% and with
heterogeneity significantly greater than zero amongst them (Q = 2511.47, p < .001, I2 = 99%).
3.1.1. Publication bias
There was evidence of minor levels of asymmetry in the lucid dreaming prevalence study estimates. With both Doi and
Funnel plots (Fig. 2) showing a greater frequency of higher estimate studies. The Doi (left) and Funnel (right) plots for lucid
dreaming prevalence studies identify potential asymmetry amongst estimates. In the presence of symmetry, the Doi plot is
expected to have symmetrical right and left limbs, with comparable numbers of studies on either limb.
This is also shown by the greater number of estimates to the right of the model in the Funnel plot, where the lines of the
funnel represent the 95% C. I. of the model estimate (already corrected for methodological quality), as the standard error
increases (i.e. studies decrease in sample size), less precise estimates are expected. These plots show that minor asymmetry
exits with a larger proportion of studies on the right limb (higher estimates). With an LFK index score of +1.83 indicative of
minor asymmetry of the estimates this suggests that publication bias or small study effects may lead pooled estimates to
lean towards the higher percentiles. However, this asymmetry is not substantial and may be attributable to the high levels
of heterogeneity among effects (for detailed rationale of the LFK index and Doi plot, see Barendregt & Doi, 2015).
Due to heterogeneity, a sensitivity analysis was conducted, which identified four studies as large contributors (Alvarado &
Zingrone, 2007; Mota-Rolim et al., 2013; Stepansky et al., 1998; Yu, 2008). Although not unique to them, three of these stud-
ies investigated lucid dreaming alongside other sleep experiences and this broader focus may explain why no additional
steps were taken to ensure participant understanding of what constitutes a lucid dream. Mota-Rolim et al. (2013) is the only
study for which this does not apply, it is also the only study conducted on a Brazilian sample. With a large sample size, their
findings may reflect a cultural difference for the prevalence of lucid dreaming; however, as the sample was self-selected it is
possible that many participants were motivated to complete the study due to their own lucid dream experiences, making the
prevalence rates of lucid dreaming over represented within the sample. Alvarado and Zingrone (2007) also may have this
issue, recruiting from among readers of a Spanish new age magazine whose interest in paranormal and consciousness topics
may have been prompted by spontaneous anomalous experiences that could inflate their prevalence figure compared with
Fig. 2. Doi & Funnel plots of lucid dreaming prevalence estimates.

203
 other samples. Overall excluding these four studies reduced total heterogeneity, though it remained significant (Q = 1134.78,
p < .001, I2 = 98%). With their removal the pooled estimate was reduced from 60% to 58%, with 95% confidence interval
estimates becoming more precise, changing from 51–68% to 51–65%. In an attempt to provide explanations for remaining
heterogeneity, moderator analyses were conducted on the variables of researcher/research group, participant nationality
and participant characteristics.
3.2. Researcher/Research group moderator analysis
Because of concerns about violation of the independence assumption, researchers contributing more than a single study
were included in a moderator analysis (Fig. 3). Overall this analysis strongly indicates no researcher systematic bias, going
some way to ameliorate concerns about the violation of the independence assumption.
3.3. Nationality moderator analysis
Moderator analysis, organising the sample estimates by participant nationality (Fig. 4), showed British samples provide
the largest weight to the final model (30.5%) and 5 of the 9 estimates (Alvarado & Zingrone, 2003; Blackmore, 1982a, 1985;
Green, 1966) are above the pooled estimate. However due to methodological quality and sample size these studies are
weighted as the smallest individual contributors to the model estimate. Overall the British samples pooled estimate is lower
Fig. 3. Quality effects moderator analysis for lucid dreaming prevalence by researcher/research group.
204
D.T. Saunders et al. / Consciousness and Cognition 43 (2016) 197–215
 (51%, 95% C. I. [36%, 66%]) than the model pooled estimate (58%, 95% C. I. [51%, 65%]) and with a wider confidence interval
due to the subgroup having the highest heterogeneity (Q = 297.42, p < .001, I2 = 97%) suggesting methodological quality and
sample characteristics are most different for this nationality. Of the seven studies in the German sub-group, the three most
weighted studies demonstrate substantial overlap with one another (Erlacher, Stumbrys, & Schredl, 2012; Schredl & Erlacher,
2011; Voss et al., 2012). Japanese samples are the only homogeneous sub-group (Q = 2.24, p = 0.13, I2 = 55%) their group
estimate is also the largest observed deviation from the model estimate, being lower than the model by 15% (43%, 95%
C. I. [37%, 48%]). Overall the two Japanese samples produced the only divergence from the pooled estimate on the basis of
participant nationality, though their influence on the final model is small (7% weight) suggesting that no great effect of
systematic bias by nationality on the final prevalence estimate is observed.
3.4. Participant characteristic moderator analysis
The next moderator analysis organises estimates by dominant participant characteristics (Fig. 5). All moderator groupings
contain significant heterogeneity, with student sample estimates making up the largest sub-group with a total of 13 out of 30
Fig. 4. Quality effects moderator analysis for lucid dreaming prevalence by participant Nationality.

205
 studies. The majority of higher estimates are found within this group (n = 7). Representative samples contribute the largest
weight to the model, from five studies and have the second lowest heterogeneity compared with other groups. Children are
the second largest contributor to the model estimate, although only comprising two studies (Schredl et al., 2012; Voss et al.,
2012) a combination of large samples and good methodological quality ratings account for this. The children studies group
estimate (45%) is the only divergence from the model estimate of 58% however there is still overlapping 95% confidence
intervals between the two.
Despite intra-group heterogeneity, only interest group study point estimates consistently deviated from the overall
model estimate. As these studies include individuals with a marked interest in lucid dreams, and consistently presented
higher estimates, these were removed resulting in a reduction in the remaining significant heterogeneity (Q = 794.53,
p < .001, I2 = 97%) resulting in an overall pooled estimate (Fig. 6) of 55% [49%, 62%] for lucid dreaming prevalence, contributed
from the remaining 27 studies included within the final model.

206

 3.5. Frequent lucid dreaming
Frequent lucid dreaming (one or more lucid dreams per month) rates were reported by 25 of the 34 studies included
within the prevalence analysis, with study estimates ranging from 8% to 50%. Studies included in the analysis of frequent
lucid dreamers are reported in Table 1. An initial pooled estimate of 22%, 95% C. I. [19%, 27%] was calculated, with significant
heterogeneity observed in the model (Q = 553.99, p < .001, I2 = 96%).
3.5.1. Publication bias
There was no evidence of asymmetry for the frequent lucid dreamer study estimates, with both Doi and funnel plots
(Fig. 7) showing symmetry amongst estimates. With an LFK index score of +0.59 this indicates no evidence of publication
bias for estimates of frequent lucid dreaming, despite the existence of significant heterogeneity.
A sensitivity analysis was performed to identify these sources of heterogeneity, for which two papers were identified as
being primary sources (Schredl, Henley-Einion, & Blagrove, 2016; Stumbrys, Erlacher & Malinowski, 2015). With these

207
 studies removed, a large reduction in heterogeneity was observed, despite remaining significant (Q = 178.2, p < .001,
I2 = 88%). This removal lowered the pooled estimate and made its interval estimate more precise (23%, 95% C. I. [20%,
25%]). Any further moderator analyses were conducted with these two studies omitted.
3.6. Frequent lucid dreaming: Moderator analyses
Moderator analysis investigating researcher/research group showed no evidence of systematic bias; the independent
study group estimate of 22%, 95% C. I. [18%, 26%] was 1% below the overall model estimate and with slightly wider confidence
intervals.
For participant nationality as a moderator variable, every nationality (Fig. 8) except single Dutch and Swiss samples over-
lap with the model estimate, suggesting no systematic differences in frequent lucid dreaming for participant nationality.
For the participant characteristic moderator analysis (Fig. 9) the largest weight is contributed by studies utilising student
samples (48.02%). The children sub-group diverge the furthest from the model estimate, with a moderator group estimate of
26%, 95% C. I. [23%, 29%]. Despite this and the lack of homogeneity within all sub groups, overall participant characteristics do
not substantially contribute to the heterogeneity observed within the model.

 None of the three moderator analysis revealed obvious sources of the remaining heterogeneity, thus all 23 studies were
retained following sensitivity analysis and are included in the final model estimate for frequent lucid dreaming, shown in
Fig. 10.
4. Discussion
This quality effects meta-analysis shows the proportion of individuals who have experienced at least one lucid dream in
their lifetime is 55% [49%, 62%] and that 23% [20%, 25%] report experiencing lucid dreams once a month or more. Despite the
existence of heterogeneity, study asymmetry was not a large issue for both lucid dreaming prevalence and frequent lucid
dreamer analyses. Greater confidence can be had in the estimates provided by the frequent lucid dreamer analysis due to
their consistency; though heterogeneity is still an issue, it is much more widespread for prevalence estimates and thus con-
clusions made regarding prevalence must be more cautious.
The final estimates we have presented are similar to those reported by Snyder and Gackenbach (1988) in their narrative
review (58% and 21% respectively), suggesting there has been little change in reported lucid dreaming incidence rates over
the last three decades and increases confidence in these estimates being an accurate reflection of lucid dreaming incidence in
the population. If so, then the incidence of frequent lucid dreamers in the population is twice that of left-handedness
(McManus, 2009), demonstrating that lucid dreams are indeed a frequent experience for many people; it also highlights
the necessity for further research to identify what differentiates these individuals from those who infrequently or never
experience lucid dreams. That 55% of the population has experienced at least one lucid dream in their lifetime suggests
the capacity for lucid dreaming is widespread; an understanding of the underlying differences between these two groups
may lead to many more individuals experiencing lucidity on a more frequent basis in the future. This will greatly benefit
research and improve understanding by allowing larger samples for research studies looking into the experience of lucid
dreaming and exploring its potential practical applications such as its use as a psychological tool for overcoming phobias
(LaBerge & Rheingold, 1990), developing the ability to control and overcome nightmares (Spoormaker, van den Bout, &
Meijer, 2003; Spoormaker & van den Bout, 2006; Zadra & Phil, 1997) or as a psychophysiological tool for the refinement
of motor-skills (Erlacher & Schredl, 2010; Stumbrys et al., 2016).
In exploring the sources of heterogeneity, for participant nationality, all group estimates were in line with the model
estimate apart from the lower values presented by two homogeneous studies using Japanese samples (Erlacher,
Stumbrys, Fujii, & Schredl, 2014; Erlacher et al., 2008) both of which have comparably good methodological quality index
(Qi) ratings (see Table 1). Given the small number of studies included in this group, it remains to be seen whether this
represents a real difference for lucidity rates in Japan. Notwithstanding this subgroup, frequent lucid dreaming estimates
for different nationalities demonstrated a consistent pattern, indicating that overall nationality does not appear to be a
significant influencing factor in lucid dreaming incidence.
Similarly, the moderator analysis for researcher/research group demonstrates no overall systematic biases, indicating that
violations of the independence assumption were unlikely to be consequential in the overall estimates arrived at.
The current study also highlights useful insights into the incidence of lucid dreaming for different participant types and
may help inform future theory generation or refinement for both the how and why of lucid dreaming.
The maturation hypothesis claims that studies utilising child and adolescent samples would show higher reported
prevalence rates and have a higher proportion of frequent lucid dreamers than adult samples. This was supported for
frequent lucid dreaming but not for prevalence, where child and adolescent sample estimates were lower than adult groups.
This implies that as people age they are increasingly more likely to report having experienced spontaneous lucid dreams.
Indeed, Voss et al. (2012) reports that prevalence rates increased steadily with age, and were highest (70%) for the oldest
in their sample (18 and 19 year olds) similar trends were also demonstrated by Schredl et al. (2012).
For frequent lucid dreaming, the estimate contributed by Voss et al. (2012) is higher than the final model estimate, in line
with the maturation hypothesis; this is also supported by student samples overall providing a higher pooled estimate at 25%.
However, student studies did not fare well in terms of methodological quality (Table 1), in part reflecting the fact that the
majority of higher estimate studies were published prior to the methodological recommendations proposed by Snyder and
Gackenbach (1988). Later research utilising some of these controls on the whole show lower estimates for student samples,
suggesting that rates of lucid dreaming may steadily increase throughout adolescence and plateau at the prevalence rates
reflective of those seen in representative samples. Further research is needed to ascertain if estimates provided by adolescent
and student samples are methodological artefacts or reflect real differences which may be attributable to age.
Lucid dreaming prevalence estimates were also at the higher end of the distribution for interest groups (70%) and
video-gamers (85%). The former finding is unsurprising given the potential for tautology, with members of special interest
groups being members potentially due to experiencing a lucid dream which may have occurred to them spontaneously,
leading them to join the group in pursuit of an explanation for their experience. Also, such groups can provide a forum that
encourages attempts to induce lucidity and so can become self-fulfilling. The estimate from the video-gamer sample is above
both the model estimate and all other participant characteristic categories, in line with predictions from Gackenbach’s
hypothesis (Gackenbach, 2006; Gackenbach & Hunt, 2014).
Aside from student samples, estimates from athletes were the most heterogeneous; though with only three studies it is
unclear if incidence rates for athletes differed from other sample types. The estimate from Erlacher et al. (2014) is below the
210
D.T. Saunders et al. / Consciousness and Cognition 43 (2016) 197–215
 overall model estimate; however, this sample comprised of Japanese athletes, so may be confounded by nationality
differences, as Japan were the only nationality to have a lower group estimate than the pooled model estimate for lucid
dreaming prevalence estimates. The other two athlete estimates suggest they are either as likely as the general population
to experience a spontaneous lucid dream or more so. This at present does not support the proposition that athletes utilise
lucid dreaming more regularly due to potential practical benefits from a motor-skill enhancement effect. Evidence from the
frequent lucid dreaming estimates suggests that athletes who experience frequent lucid dreams are proportionate to
representative samples (21%) suggesting an increased use of mental imagery in waking life (Cumming & Hall, 2002) alone
does not lead to a greater propensity for frequent lucid dreams. In light of the inconsistency of estimates for this sample type,
further studies are required in order to determine if the proposed benefits suggested by Erlacher and Schredl (2008) and
Tholey (1990) of lucid dreaming for motor-action translates into athlete groups being more likely to experience lucid dreams
and experience them with a greater frequency when compared to representative samples.
Regarding study methodology, a key finding from this paper is the average Qi rating of studies presented as 0.46, suggest-
ing lucid dreaming incidence study methodologies can be improved for future research. It is recommended that researchers
wishing to investigate lucid dreaming incidence ensure the necessary methodological steps are in place to increase confi-
dence in their findings. These steps include; the provision of a clear definition of what constitutes a lucid dream, with no
stipulation that dream control is a necessity (however, additional information on the degree of disassociation, control and
insight experienced would be useful); this definition should be supplemented by an example dream narrative and a request
for a written account of one of their own experiences, which should be judged for characteristic signs that demonstrate the
dream account is clearly of a lucid dream, questionable accounts should not be qualified. In self-report studies, questions
regarding lucid dream frequency should provide no less than a 7 point response scale. Here it is recommended a standard-
ised measurement protocol is utilised so direct comparisons across samples can be made. Due to providing the respondent
with eight options, the scale presented by Schredl and Erlacher (2004) was the most sensitive measure of frequent lucid
dreaming we reviewed. By measuring the frequency of lucidity from less than once a year up to once a week or more, it
clearly determines the frequency of lucid dream experiences, unlike some other scales which have been used (e.g.
Blackmore, 1983, 1985; Mota-Rolim et al., 2013). Furthermore Erlacher and Schredl’s scale has been shown by Stumbrys,
Erlacher, and Schredl (2013) to have good test-retest reliability r = 0.89 (p < .001). Therefore it is recommended over other
previously adopted self-report scales of lucid dreaming frequency for utilisation in future research in this area. Finally, a con-
sideration of potential confounding variables is recommended as in the procedure presented by Voss et al. (2012) in order to
control for issues of suggestibility and social desirability in self report studies.
It is further recommended that all data regarding suspected relevant sample characteristics be recorded alongside inci-
dence measures to aid in the identification of sources of variability amongst estimates. By adhering to these recommenda-
tions, researchers can be confident that the data gathered is a valid reflection of lucid dreaming incidence in the population.
The quality effects meta-analysis method utilised is a new technique which was initially developed for epidemiological
research (Doi & Thalib, 2008). In this paper we have shown it can be usefully applied to other topic areas in place of a random
or fixed effect analysis, particularly where clearly identifiable differences exist in study methodological quality, in order to
provide additional control for this source of potential bias. The degree to which this is effectively controlled rests on the
development of an effective quality assessment scale, the scale developed for this study (LDIM-Qi) attempts to incorporate
all methodological considerations which have been highlighted as problematic in the literature. The scale is scored in a way
that reduces subjective judgement on the part of the assessor, with many items being binary decisions. Thus we believe it is
an effective and reliable tool for measuring the methodological quality of studies in this area.
A limitation of this study is that despite attempts to be as inclusive as possible papers may have been missed by our
search of the literature. Additionally, we were unable to gain contact with several primary authors, despite emails being sent
no replies were received, thus it is likely that additional grey literature exists which was not included within this paper.
Furthermore, the sources of heterogeneity across both analyses were not effectively identified, though it seems interest
group estimates and studies that do not focus on lucid dreaming specifically are certainly contributors to the observed
heterogeneity. The findings from this analysis do go some way to informing us of what are not sources of heterogeneity
and also correct the model estimates in light of methodological quality, where the tendency appeared for poorer quality
studies to provide higher incidence estimates.
In conclusion, the findings imply the original estimates presented by Snyder and Gackenbach (1988) were not
influenced by the kinds of bias this analysis controls for and thus this study lends support to the earlier conclusions while
providing more robust point and interval estimates by taking study methodological quality and potential moderator
variables into account. Overall this review can serve to inform future research by contributing to the confidence that
can be had in our knowledge of how common lucid dreaming is and how many of the population experience them at least
once a month.
