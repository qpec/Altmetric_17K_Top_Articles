Glucose and glycolysis are important for the proinflammatory functions of many immune
cells, and depletion of glucose in pathological microenvironments is associated with defective
immune responses. Here we show a contrasting function for glucose in dendritic cells (DCs),
as glucose represses the proinflammatory output of LPS-stimulated DCs and inhibits
DC-induced T-cell responses. A glucose-sensitive signal transduction circuit involving the
mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), HIF1a and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) coordinates
DC metabolism and function to limit DC-stimulated T-cell responses. When multiple T cells
interact with a DC, they compete for nutrients, which can limit glucose availability to the DCs.
In
such
DCs,
glucose-dependent
signalling
is
inhibited,
altering
DC
outputs
and
enhancing T-cell responses. These data reveal a mechanism by which T cells regulate the
DC microenvironment to control DC-induced T-cell responses and indicate that glucose is an
important signal for shaping immune responses.

ellular metabolism has emerged as an important regulator
of immune cell function not only through facilitating the
energy and biosynthetic demands of the cell but also
through directly controlling important immune cell functions1.
Glycolysis is important for the proinflammatory functions of
multiple immune cell subsets; glycolytic enzymes and metabolites
can
regulate
immune
signalling
and
effector
functions2,3.
The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is
described in many immune cells as a central regulator of immune
cell metabolism that promotes elevated levels of glycolysis
through promoting the activity of the transcription factors
cMyc and hypoxia-inducible factor 1a (HIF1a), which induce
the expression of glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes4–7.
mTORC1 is important in controlling the differentiation and
function of immune cells, and it is becoming clear that this is
achieved in part through the regulation of cellular metabolic
pathways4,8,9.
Although
the
mTORC1-specific
inhibitor
rapamycin
was
originally
characterized
as
a
potent
immunosuppressant required for the generation of effector
T-cell responses, inhibition of mTORC1 in myeloid cells
actually
results
in
increased
inflammatory
outputs10,11.
Therefore, mTORC1 signalling can be either proinflammatory
or anti-inflammatory depending on the immune cell subset,
although it is not clear whether mTORC1-controlled metabolic
alterations are important for these differential effects.
Dendritic cells (DCs) undergo substantial changes in function
following immune activation to adopt an important role in
stimulating immune responses, and these functional changes are
associated with altered metabolism. In DCs differentiated from
bone marrow in the presence of the growth factor granulocyte
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (GM-DCs),
rates of cellular glycolysis are rapidly increased, within minutes,
once activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Then over the
course of 18 h, GM-DCs switch to a highly glycolytic metabolism;
GM-DCs display increased glycolytic rates and an inactivation of
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)12,13. At this
point postactivation (18 h), DCs would normally have reached
the draining lymph node where they would be interacting with
T cells. The balance between glycolysis and OXPHOS is an
important effector of immune cell differentiation and the
modulation of inflammatory responses14–16. Although there is
some evidence that OXPHOS levels affect DC function, the
relationship between DC metabolism and DC-induced T-cell
responses is not well defined17.
As the flux through cellular metabolic pathways is controlled
by the supply of nutrients, there is renewed interest in nutrient
levels in immune microenvironments and how they affect
immune responses. For instance, reduced glucose levels in the
tumour microenvironment can directly impact upon T-cell
receptor signalling and inhibit antitumour T-cell responses3.
It is likely that nutrient levels will also be important for immune
cell function at sites of bacterial and viral infections where there is
considerably increased demand for nutrients, such as glucose18,19.
DCs experience diverse microenvironments within tissue, at
inflammatory sites and as they migrate to the draining lymph
nodes where they activate T cells, often interacting with
numerous T cells at a time20,21. It is not clear how the
availability of nutrients within these microenvironments affects
DC metabolic pathways to control DC function and the induction
of T cells’ responses.
Here
we
establish
that
glucose
represses
DC
inflammatory outputs and thus DC-induced T-cell proliferation
and interferon-g (IFNg) production. A complex glucose-sensing
mTORC1/HIF1a/inducible
nitric
oxide
synthase
(iNOS)
signalling circuit integrates information about glucose levels in
the local microenvironment to coordinate DC metabolism and
function. Competitive uptake of glucose by activated T cells can
starve DCs of glucose, inactivate this glucose-sensing signalling
circuit and promote proinflammatory DC outputs to enhance
T-cell responses.
Results
Glucose deprivation enhances DC-induced T-cell responses.
Increased glycolysis is required immediately following LPS
activation of DCs to facilitate an expansion of the biosynthetic
machinery, that is, the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum
apparatus22. However, elevated glycolysis is also a feature of DC
metabolism for prolonged periods after activation at points
when DCs interact with T cells and promote T-cell responses.
To establish the role that glucose and increased rates of glycolysis
play for DC-induced T-cell responses, GM-DCs were switched
from glucose into galactose 8 h after LPS stimulation. Galactose
is an alternative cellular fuel to glucose that can be metabolized
by glycolysis and OXPHOS to provide energy for the cell but
galactose can only maintain low rates of glycolysis in GM-DCs
(Fig. 1a)2,23. Removing glucose and limiting the rate of glycolysis
in this way affected the expression of the costimulatory molecules
CD80 and CD86 on activated GM-DCs. LPS-induced expression
of CD80 and CD86 peaked at 24 h and then declined 48 and 72 h
after stimulation when GM-DCs are cultured with glucose
(Fig. 1b,c). In contrast, glucose deprived GM-DCs, that is, cells
cultured in galactose, maintained high levels of CD80 and CD86
for the duration of the 72 h post LPS stimulation (Fig. 1b,c).
During this time course, there were no differences in GM-DC
viability (Fig. 1d). Levels of another costimulatory molecule CD40
were unchanged in the absence of glucose (Fig. 1e). Cytokines
produced by DCs are another important signal for shaping
the
T-cell
immune
response.
Glucose-deprived
GM-DCs
expressed elevated levels of Il12a mRNA but normal levels of
Il10 mRNA (Fig. 1f). Similar increases in Il12a mRNA were
observed
when
GM-DC
were
cultured
in
decreasing
concentrations of glucose (Fig. 1g). Next, the impact of these
functional changes on DC-stimulated T-cell responses was
investigated. GM-DCs were LPS-stimulated, pulsed with the
peptide SIINFEKL and cultured in the presence of glucose or
galactose for up to 72 h. At the indicated time points after LPS
activation, GM-DCs from each condition were washed, placed
into glucose-containing media and then co-cultured with purified
CD8 þ OTI T cells for a further 48 h. CD8 þ OTI transgenic T
cells express a single T-cell receptor that recognizes major
histocompatibility

expression (Fig. 2a,b). However, distinct differences in the
nature of the T-cell response were observed in the absence of
glucose. The capacity of glucose-cultured GM-DCs to induce OTI
T-cell clonal expansion declined at 48 h and was lost at 72 h post
LPS stimulation (Fig. 2c,d). In contrast, GM-DCs cultured in
galactose retained the ability to induce T-cell clonal expansion for
the duration of the 72 h stimulation (Fig. 2c,d). Glucose-deprived
GM-DCs also induced increased IFNg production in T cells
72 h post LPS stimulation (Fig. 2e–g). A direct effect of galactose
on the phenotype of LPS-stimulated GM-DC was excluded
as GM-DCs cultured in glucose or glucose plus galactose were
phenotypically
identical
and

responses (Supplementary Fig. 1). Overall, the data show that

impacts
upon

responses.

 GM-DCs undergo glycolytic reprogramming, the increased
expression of glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes
(Fig. 3a). A key observation was that in addition to directly
limiting the rate of glycolysis, switching GM-DCs from glucose
to
galactose
also
prevented
glycolytic
reprogramming
of
LPS-stimulated GM-DCs (Fig. 3b). These data argue that glucose
affects metabolic signal transduction pathways. The transcription
factors cMyc and HIF1a are both described to promote the
expression of glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes in
immune cells5,6,24. As cMyc is not expressed in DCs25, we
investigated whether glucose is required for the activity of HIF1a
in LPS-stimulated GM-DCs. LPS stimulation of GM-DCs resulted
in the increased expression of HIF1a protein but not that of Hif1a
mRNA (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 2a). Increased HIF1a protein
corresponded to elevated HIF1a transcriptional activity, based
on the expression of prolyl hydroxylase 3 (Phd3) mRNA, an
established HIF1a target gene (Fig. 3c). The specificity of these
assays was confirmed using HIF1a-null GM-DC (Hif1a � / �)
from Hif1aflox/flox Vav-Cre mice; these GM-DCs do not express
HIF1a protein or Phd3 mRNA (Fig. 3c). LPS-induced HIF1a
activity was observed 16 h after stimulation and so correlated with
LPS-induced glycolytic reprogramming (Fig. 3a, Supplementary
Fig. 2b). To determine whether HIF1a expression or activity was
sensitive to glucose availability, LPS-stimulated GM-DCs were
cultured in decreasing concentrations of glucose and HIF1a
protein levels and Phd3 mRNA levels ascertained. Reducing the
concentration of glucose from 10 to 2 mM was sufficient to
prevent LPS-induced HIF1a protein expression and activity
(Fig. 3d,e). A second complementary approach that involved
replacing glucose with galactose also prevented LPS-stimulated
HIF1a expression and activity (Fig. 3e,f). However, interestingly,
these two approaches regulate HIF1a protein expression through
distinct mechanisms. Decreased glucose concentrations activated
the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), as measured by
increased phosphorylation of the AMPK substrate acetyl-CoA
carboxylase (ACC; Fig. 3e). AMPK is a kinase that is activated
when cells are experiencing energy stress. In CD8 T cells, glucose
deprivation activates AMPK to result in the inhibition of

 mTORC1 signalling26. Indeed, mTORC1 is also inactive in
GM-DCs
cultured
in
low
glucose,
as
measured
by
the
phosphorylation
of
the
mTORC1
substrate
p70
S6-kinase
(pS6K) and the S6K substrate S6 ribosomal protein (pS6)
(Fig. 3e). As our previous work in CD8 T cells showed that
mTORC1 activity is essential for HIF1a expression, it was
reasoned that mTORC1 inactivation in these GM-DCs leads to
loss of HIF1a activity5. Indeed, as predicted the mTORC1
inhibitor rapamycin abolishes HIF1a protein expression and
activity
in
LPS-stimulated
GM-DCs
(Fig.
3g).
Therefore,
decreasing
glucose
levels
inhibits
HIF1a
activity
via
the
inactivation of mTORC1 signalling. In contrast, replacing
glucose with galactose does not activate AMPK nor does it
inactivate mTORC1 signalling (Fig. 3e). This is because, while
culturing GM-DCs in galactose only maintains low levels of
glycolysis, it results in increased rather than decreased rates of
OXPHOS coupled to ATP synthesis, which is sufficient to avoid
energy crisis and AMPK activation (Fig. 3h). Therefore, an
alternative mTORC1-independent mechanism must underpin the
lack of HIF1a protein expression under these conditions.
Hif1a � / � GM-DCs were then analysed to establish whether
HIF1a is required for LPS-induced glycolytic reprogramming.
LPS-stimulated
Hif1a � / �
GM-DCs
had
reduced
rates
of
glycolysis and failed to upregulate the expression of glycolytic
genes (Fig. 4a,b). Similarly, inhibition of mTORC1, which blocks
HIF1a expression, was shown to prevent elevated glycolysis and
glycolytic reprogramming in LPS-activated GM-DC (Fig. 4c,d).
Therefore, the data show that glucose is required for LPS-induced
glycolytic reprogramming because it facilitates the expression and
activity of the HIF1a transcription factor.
HIF1a and iNOS signalling coordinates DC metabolic pathways.
Our metabolic analysis of LPS-stimulated GM-DCs revealed
that glucose is required for the inactivation of OXPHOS;
galactose-cultured GM-DCs failed to downregulate OXPHOS
(Fig. 5a). Previous reports have shown that nitric oxide (NO)
produced by iNOS is responsible for the inactivation of OXPHOS in
LPS-stimulated GM-DCs13. Therefore, we considered whether
glucose is required for iNOS expression and NO production in
LPS-activated GM-DCs. The data showed that LPS-induced NO
production was completely blocked in galactose-cultured GM-DCs,
as determined by measuring nitrite levels in the culture medium
(Fig. 5b). Given that galactose-cultured GM-DCs have lost HIF1a
expression, we investigated whether the loss of iNOS expression
may be related to defective HIF1a activity. iNOS expression and
activity was measured under multiple experimental conditions that
inhibit HIF1a expression. Rapamycin-treated GM-DCs that do not
express HIF1a (Fig. 3g) are also deficient for iNOS expression, NO
production and they do not inactivate OXPHOS (Fig. 5c,d).
Hif1a� /� GM-DC have greatly reduced levels of Nos2 mRNA and
protein and produce reduced levels of NO (Fig. 5e,f). Therefore, the
data argue that HIF1a activity is required for iNOS expression in
LPS-stimulated GM-DCs. We next considered whether HIF1a
expression is sufficient to promote iNOS expression. A family of
prolyl
hydroxylases
target
HIF1a
for
ubiquitin-mediated
proteasomal degradation, thus repressing HIF1a protein levels.
HIF1a protein levels increase when these prolyl hydroxylases are
inhibited. While GM-DCs lacking mTORC1 activity do not express
HIF1a or iNOS (Fig. 5c), promoting the stabilization of HIF1a
protein with the prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor dimethyloxaloylglycine
(DMOG) is sufficient to induce Nos2 mRNA and protein

 expression and to increase NO production (Fig. 5g,h). Interestingly,
experiments that disrupted iNOS activity in LPS-stimulated GM-
DCs revealed that HIF1a protein expression is also dependent on
iNOS activity. Direct inhibition of iNOS, using the specific inhibitor
S-ethylisothiourea (SEITU), prevented HIF1a protein expression
and activity in LPS-stimulated GM-DCs (Fig. 6a). NO production
by iNOS requires the substrate arginine. Depriving GM-DCs of
arginine prevented NO production in LPS-stimulated GM-DC and
inhibited HIF1a activity (Fig. 6b,c). Arginine deprivation did not
inhibit mTORC1 signalling arguing that reduced HIF1a activity was
due to decreased NO production (Fig. 6c). Consistent with
decreased HIF1a activity, arginine deprivation prevented LPS-
induced glycolysis and glycolytic reprogramming (Fig. 6d,e). Finally,
GM-DCs were generated from iNOS knockout mice; these cells did
not express HIF1a protein or Phd3 mRNA in response to LPS
stimulation (Fig. 6f). Reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen
species are known inhibitors of the prolyl hydroxylases that target
HIF1a for degradation. Therefore, the data suggest that NO is
required for HIF1a stabilization. The data show that HIF1a and
iNOS have a reciprocal relationship, and each molecule is required
for the expression of the other. A time course analysis of Nos2
mRNA expression and HIF1a activity (Phd3 mRNA expression)
revealed that Nos2 mRNA expression but not HIF1a activity is
increased 4h after LPS activation. There is an additional increase in
Nos2 mRNA expression observed after 16h that coincides with the

 (Supplementary Fig. 2b,c). These data support a model where
iNOS-dependent NO initially promotes HIF1a protein stabilization
and then a feed-forward loop ensues where HIF1a promotes iNOS
expression and NO production stabilizes HIF1a protein, leading to
elevated levels of both iNOS and HIF1a. Nos2 mRNA expression
only becomes sensitive to rapamycin once HIF1a is active, after
16h, arguing that mTORC1 controls the HIF1a-iNOS signalling
axis by regulating the expression of HIF1a (Supplementary
Fig. 2b,c).
Given that classical DC subsets do not express iNOS, we next
considered whether NO from exogenous sources, such as from
activated macrophages, would be sufficient to stabilize HIF1a
within activated GM-DCs that lack iNOS expression. The
addition of a NO donor to LPS-stimulated Nos2 � / � GM-DCs
for 4 h was sufficient to induce the expression of HIF1a protein
and activity (Fig. 6f). Co-culture experiments were also performed
using a transwell system where molecules such as NO, but not
cells, can be exchanged between the chambers. The addition of
transwells containing LPS/IFNg-activated bone marrow-derived
macrophages
(BMDMs)
to
wells
containing
LPS-activated
Nos2 � / � GM-DCs for 4 h was sufficient to induce HIF1a
protein expression and activity in the Nos2 � / �
GM-DCs
(Fig. 6g). This effect was dependent on BMDMs expressed iNOS
as the HIF1a protein expression in Nos2 � / � GM-DC was lost
when the iNOS inhibitor SEITU was added to the coculture
(Fig. 6h). These data demonstrate that a complex signalling
circuit involving mTORC1, HIF1a, iNOS and NO coordinates the
LPS-induced metabolic shift from OXPHOS to glycolysis.
HIF1a
negatively
affects
DC-induced
T-cell
responses.
To prove that the anti-inflammatory effect of glucose is mediated
by
HIF1a/iNOS
signalling,
the
functions
of
Hif1a � / �
and
Nos2 � / �GM-DCs
were
investigated.
LPS-stimulated
Hif1a � / �
and Nos2 � / �GM-DCs sustained elevated levels
of costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 as seen in galactose-
cultured GM-DCs (Fig. 7a–d, Supplementary Fig. 3c). The
addition of exogenous NO to Nos2 � / �GM-DC cultures, which is
sufficient to induce HIF1a protein expression (Fig. 6f), prevented
these elevated levels of CD80 and CD86 expression (Fig. 7c,d,
Supplementary Fig. 3b,c). Hif1a � / � and Nos2 � / � GM-DCs
also had increased expression of IL12a and TNF mRNA but
normal IL10 mRNA expression (Fig. 7e–g). Similar increases in
IL12a mRNA levels were observed under other experimental
conditions that resulted in reduced HIF1a expression: GM-DCs
treated with rapamycin or SEITU (Supplementary Fig. 3d,e)
or GM-DCs deprived of glucose (Figs 1f and 3f). Exposing
LPS-stimulated Nos2 � / � GM-DCs to exogenous NO for just 4 h
was sufficient to inhibit the expression of IL12a and TNF mRNA
(Fig. 7f,g). Additionally, pharmacologically increasing HIF1a
protein levels in Nos2 � / � GM-DCs using DMOG was sufficient
to inhibit IL12a mRNA expression, thus confirming that HIF1a
negatively regulates the production of this proinflammatory
cytokine (Fig. 7h).
Consistent with these observed differences in GM-DCs proin-
flammatory functions, Hif1a� /� and Nos2 � / � GM-DCs had
enhanced capacity to induce OTI T-cell proliferation (Fig. 7i–l).
Exogenous NO reversed the enhanced T-cell proliferation induced
by Nos2� /� GM-DCs (Fig. 7k,l). Together, these data argue that
glucose-controlled HIF1a represses GM-DCs proinflammatory
functions and limits DC-dependent T-cell responses.
T cells can deplete glucose from the DC microenvironment.
This study has characterized a complex signalling circuit in
GM-DCs that is sensitive to the available levels of glucose but
also to the availability of other nutrients (Fig. 8a). Amino acid
availability can also impact upon this signalling circuit through
inhibiting
NO
production
or
mTORC1
activity
(Fig.
6b,
Supplementary Fig. 4a). Systemic levels of glucose are tightly
controlled and glucose levels do not drop to low levels even in the
starved state; this is not surprising given the importance of glu-
cose as a cellular fuel. However, there is a growing appreciation
that
glucose
levels
can
become
limiting
in
discrete
microenvironments,
such
as
the
tumour
or
inflammatory
microenvironments. Close interactions with T cells are central to
the function of DCs to stimulate T-cell responses. Given that
during immune activation T cells have a substantially increased
demand for glucose and the fact that multiple activating T cells
can form clusters around a single DC20,21, we reasoned that these
circumstances could result in glucose becoming limiting within
the immediate DC microenvironment. To investigate whether
activating T cells could limit the nutrient levels available to DCs,
we measured the uptake of the fluorescent glucose analogue
2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-2-deoxyglucose

 (NBDG) into T cells and GM-DCs in co-culture experiments.
SIINFEKL-pulsed GM-DCs were co-cultured with increasing
numbers of purified CD8 OTI T cells for 20 h and NBDG uptake
analysed by flow cytometry. Increasing the ratio of T cells to DCs
resulted in decreased levels of NBDG uptake into GM-DCs
(Fig. 8b). In contrast, the level of NBDG uptake into the T cells
was equivalent for all DC:T-cell ratios, indicating that there was
not a global deficit in NBDG in these cultures (Fig. 8b,
Supplementary Fig. 4b). These data argue that T cells can limit
glucose uptake into GM-DCs due to competitive uptake. Given
that glucose deprivation can result in the inhibition of mTORC1
signalling (Fig. 3e)26, we considered whether mTORC1 signalling
was altered in GM-DCs in these co-culture experiments.
Increasing numbers of T cells resulted in decreased levels of
pS6
within
the
GM-DCs
but
not
in
T
cells
(Fig.
8c,
Supplementary Fig. 4c). pS6 levels were also investigated in
GM-DCs by confocal microscopy. LPS-stimulated GM-DCs
cultured at a 1:2 DC:T-cell ratio were observed to have high
levels of pS6 (white arrows), as compared to the rapamycin-
negative control (Fig. 8d,e). In contrast, when cultured at a 1:10
DC:T-cell ratio, T cells were observed to cluster around GM-DCs
and pS6 levels within the GM-DCs were comparable to the
rapamycin control (yellow arrows; Fig. 8d,e). The T cells within
these DC:T-cell clusters maintained high levels of pS6, indicating
that the T cells were nutrient replete (Fig. 8d,e). Within the 1:10
DC:T-cell ratio cultures, there were a minority of GM-DCs that
were only interacting with a small number of T cells and these
GM-DCs had high levels of pS6 (white arrow compared to yellow
arrow; Fig. 8f). Therefore, the data suggest that local nutrient
depletion in the GM-DC microenvironment results in the loss of
mTORC1 signalling as opposed to a global deficit of nutrients in
the cultures (Fig. 8d–f). According to the signalling circuit
identified in this study (Fig. 8a), reduced mTORC1 signalling
would be predicted to result in decreased HIF1a and iNOS
activity. As CD8 T cells do not produce NO, we determined
the level of NO production in these cultures as a measure of
HIF1a/iNOS
signalling
in
the
GM-DCs.
There
was
a
clear decrease in NO production in the co-cultures with
increased CD8 T cells (Fig. 8g). Consistent with a role
for glucose and mTORC1/HIF1a/iNOS signalling in repressing
DC-induced
T-cell
responses,
there
was
increased
IFNg
production in OTI T cells activated under conditions where
nutrient
availability
to
GM-DCs
was
limited
(Fig.
8h,
Supplementary Fig. 4d,e). Numerous studies have demonstrated
that pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1, using the inhibitor
rapamycin, increased the proinflammatory outputs of human and
murine DC subsets that do not express iNOS27–30. This suggested
to us that the inhibition of mTORC1 due to nutrient deprivation
in iNOS-negative DC would also lead to enhanced T-cell
responses. To test this hypothesis, Nos2 � / � GM-DCs were
co-cultured with different ratios of OTI T cells, as above, and
IFNg expression in the T cells was assessed. As predicted,

 increasing the numbers of T cells interacting with the Nos2 � / �
GM-DCs resulted in elevated levels of IFNg production in CD8 T
cells (Fig. 8i,j), though the magnitude of the differences were less
than those observed in GM-DCs that express iNOS (Fig. 8h,
Supplementary Fig. 4d,e).
Next, we investigated whether activating T cells can deprive
DCs of nutrients within a lymph node in vivo. An experiment was
designed to manipulate DC–T-cell interactions within a draining
lymph node using an adoptive transfer-based approach. LPS- and
SIINFEKL-pulsed GM-DCs were injected into the lateral tarsal
region of host mice, and then 4 h later purified CD8 OTI were
injected intravenously into the same mice. To manipulate the
ratio of T cells to DC, the number of OTI T cells injected was
varied. Using this approach, the transferred DC and OTI T cells
would arrive at the draining popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes
via physiological routes from the tissue and blood, respectively.
The draining lymph nodes were harvested, the numbers of
transferred GM-DCs and OTI T cells determined and the level of
pS6 in the transferred GM-DCs analysed. The ratio of GM-DCs
to OTI T cells in each individual lymph node was determined. In
lymph nodes containing o10 OTI T cells per GM-DC, pS6 levels
within the GM-DCs were significantly higher than those
measured in GM-DCs from lymph nodes where the T-cell–DC
ratio was 410 (Fig. 8k,l). These data argue that increased
numbers of activating OTI T cells can deprive GM-DCs of
glucose in vivo to result in the inactivation of mTORC1 signalling.
Importantly, the levels of pS6 in activated OTI T cells was not
affected by the DC-to-T-cell ratio, indicating that nutrients were
not generally limiting within the lymph node (Fig. 8m).
Taken together, these data argue that competitive uptake of
glucose is not just a feature of pathological microenvironments
but has a role during the induction of normal immune responses
to shape the T-cell response.
Discussion
The present study explores the signalling pathways that link
glucose in the local microenvironment to changes in DC

 metabolism and function. A key finding was that glucose
represses the proinflammatory functions of GM-DCs, inhibiting
the induction of T-cell proliferation and IFNg production.
Glucose does not prevent DC-induced T-cell activation but it
changes the course of the T-cell response. Glucose-deprived
GM-DCs show increased costimulatory molecule and IL12
expression, signals known to be important for the induction of
T-cell
proliferation
and
the
acquisition
of
T-cell
effector
functions31,32. Therefore, the observed changes in the T-cell
response correlate to the functional changes in glucose-starved
GM-DCs. These data argue that glucose represents an important
signal that can impact upon the outcome of the T-cell response.
This study shows that a complex signalling circuit involving
mTORC1, HIF1a and iNOS relays signals from the local DCs
microenvironment regarding glucose availability to coordinate
the metabolic and functional changes in LPS-stimulated DCs.
This circuit is also sensitive to the levels of amino acids such as
leucine and arginine that are required for mTORC1 and iNOS
activity, respectively. NO that originates from exogenous sources
such as local macrophages will also regulate this signalling
circuit33.
Numerous
studies
have
demonstrated
that
the
mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin increases the proinflammatory
outputs of DCs: increased IL12 and costimulatory molecule
expression27–30. Indeed, inhibition of mTORC1 in human or
mouse DCs during TLR stimulation augments the proliferation
of effector CD4 þ T cells in vitro29,34,35. All these studies
inhibited mTORC1 pharmacologically, but we now present a
model where this can occur physiologically due to nutrient
deprivation. Importantly, the data show that nutrient deprivation
of Nos2 � / �
GM-DCs also enhances CD8 T-cell priming,
indicating that this model is likely to be applicable to multiple
DC subsets. Taken together, this represents a new regulatory axis
for the control of DC proinflammatory functions and T-cell
responses.
iNOS and mTORC1 have previously been shown to be
important for the metabolic shift from OXPHOS to glycolysis
in DCs13,17. This study now reveals the transcription factor
HIF1a as the key molecular link required for the sustained
induction of glycolysis in LPS-stimuated DCs. The data show that
HIF1a and iNOS activities are closely connected in LPS-activated
GM-DCs with the expression of each reliant on the activity of the
other. In non-immune cells, hypoxia-induced HIF1a has been
shown to bind to DNA elements in the Nos2 promoter and
increase gene expression, while NO has been reported to induce
HIF1a protein expression, though the exact mechanisms involved
are not clear36–38. While this signalling circuit will certainly be
different in DC subsets that do not express iNOS, it is likely that
HIF1a will still be central to the control of cellular glycolysis.
Indeed, splenic DCs stimulated in vivo in mice following
poly(I:C) injection increase glycolysis and inactivate OXPHOS
in a HIF1a-dependant manner even though they do not express
iNOS39. The question arises as to how these cells inhibit
OXPHOS in the absence of iNOS expression. Herein we
demonstrate that HIF1a protein expression is induced in
GM-DCs that lack the expression of iNOS in response to
exogenously derived NO from sources such as proinflammatory
macrophages. Additionally, another study demonstrated that
iNOS knockout GM-DCs can inhibit OXPHOS normally in
response to LPS but only when co-cultured with wild-type
GM-DCs, thus demonstrating that NO-dependent inhibition of
OXPHOS can be a cell-extrinsic effect17. Therefore, it seems likely
that exogenously derived NO has an important regulatory role
for DC metabolism and function. Certainly, NO produced by
phagocytes has been shown to diffuse across membranes to act
upon multiple cells in the local microenvironment33. Therefore,
DC expression of HIF1a appears to be essential for the metabolic
changes that occur in activated DCs, while NO can originate
from iNOS expressed within the DCs or may originate from other
cells in the local microenvironment.
This
study
reveals
that
in
GM-DCs,
there
are
two
glucose-sensing mechanisms. The AMPK/mTORC1 signalling
axis can sense decreasing glucose concentrations to result in the
loss of HIF1a protein expression and activity and leading to
decreased iNOS expression and NO production. This finding is
consistent with our previous work in CD8 T cells that showed
glucose withdrawal inhibits mTORC1 signalling following the
activation of AMPK26. Additionally, the data show that HIF1a
protein expression is directly sensitive to glucose deprivation in
GM-DCs independently of mTORC1 activity. Recently, it was
demonstrated that glucose is required for the protein expression
of cMyc in CD8 T cells because glucose feeds the glucosamine
pathway that is required for GlcNAcylation of proteins, the
reversible addition of UDP-GlcNAc to serine or threonine
residues40.
Therefore,
one
potential
mTORC1-independent
mechanism
for
promoting
HIF1a
stabilization
is
through
protein GlcNAcylation. Indeed, GlcNAcylation has been linked
to HIF1a protein expression by one study in tumour cells41.
Further work is required to identify mTORC1-independent
mechanisms linking glucose availability to HIF1a expression in
DCs.
Multiple lines of evidence have described cellular glycolysis as
having
proinflammatory
functions
in
immune
cells24,42,43.
However, a number of studies have described examples where
glycolysis can have immunosuppressive functions; glycolysis is
important for certain regulatory T cells subsets both in mice and
humans44,45; glycolysis is required for the maintenance of DC
tolerance in a vitamin D-induced DC tolerance model46.
Additionally, it is becoming clear that HIF1a can also promote
anti-inflammatory effects under certain conditions. For example,
under conditions of hypoxia HIF1a has been directly linked to
the expression of the immunosuppressive molecules PD-L1
and miR-210 in myeloid cells47,48. While most studies to date
in T cells and macrophages suggest that HIF1a plays a
predominantly proinflammatory role, the data in DCs are less
clear. Several papers have shown that HIF1a is required for
DC migration, particularly in a hypoxic environment and for IFN
production49–51. However, an understanding of the role HIF1a
plays in DC-induced T-cell responses is still developing. Early
reports suggested that HIF1a was required for costimulatory
molecule and proinflammatory molecule expression in DCs, as
knock down of HIF1a reduced their expression in a hypoxic
environment52. In contrast, a report suggests that hypoxia affects
costimulatory
molecules
and
cytokine
production
in
DCs
independently of HIF1a49. Overall, the available data support
multiple roles for HIF1a in DCs that may differ dependent on the
presence or absence of oxygen. More recently, an elegant study of
DCs function during Leishmania infection found that HIF1a in
DCs promoted a regulatory T-cell response and deleting HIF1a
resulted in enhanced DC-dependent IL12 production and
increased CD8 T-cell proliferation53. This study is consistent
with the data presented herein showing an anti-inflammatory role
for normoxic HIF1a in DCs to limit the induction of CD8 T-cell
responses.
While competitive glucose uptake in pathological situations
such as within tumours is now becoming established as a
mechanism utilized by tumour cells to alter the course of immune
response, the data presented in this study argue that competitive
glucose uptake is also a feature of normal immune responses. In
fact, in addition to glucose, several amino acids will impact
upon mTORC1/HIF1a/iNOS signalling including leucine and
glutamine, which are important for mTORC1 activity, and
arginine, the fuel for iNOS dependent NO production7. The data

approaches
demonstrates
that
activating
T
cells
interacting
with
the
antigen-presenting
DC
can
deplete
nutrients
from
the
immediate DC microenvironment resulting in the inhibition of
this nutrient-sensitive mTORC1/HIF1a/iNOS signalling circuit.
During a robust immune response, DC present multiple T-cell
antigens and can encourage multiple simultaneous interactions
with T cells resulting in the formation of DC–T-cell clusters of up
to 12 T cells21,54. Given that activated T cells dramatically
upregulate rates of glucose and amino acid uptake5,7, it is perhaps
unsurprising that the immediate microenvironment surrounding
a DC in such a T-cell cluster becomes nutrient deprived.
Therefore, competition for glucose or amino acids will allow
these closely interacting cells to adopt contrasting signalling and
metabolic states, glycolytic T cells compared to non-glycolytic
DCs engaging in oxidative metabolism; both metabolic states that
maximize the proinflammatory functions of the respective
immune subset. This innovative mechanism allows T cells to
promote the proinflammatory functions of the antigen-presenting
DC to enhance and prolong the T cell response.
Methods
Mice. Male C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Harlan (Bicester, UK) and
maintained in compliance with EU regulations. Permission to perform mouse
experiments was granted by the Animal Research Ethics Committee (AREC),
Trinity College Dublin and the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA),
Ireland. Bones from Hif1aflox/flox VavCre mice and Hif1aWT/WT VavCre mice
(males and females) were obtained from the Cantrell laboratory in the University of
Dundee. OTI transgenic mice were initially purchased from Harlan (Bicester, UK)
and then bred in house. Male Nos2 knockout mice were imported from The
Jackson Laboratories. All mice were on the C57BL/6J genetic background and were
used between the ages of 6 and 20 weeks.
DC culture. Bone marrow derived DCs (GM-DC) were generated by culturing
bone marrow-derived haematopoietic cells in the presence of 20 ng ml � 1 GM-CSF
for 10 days55. Bone marrow was isolated from the femur and tibia-fibula bones of
C57/BLJ male mice, followed by RBC lysis. The haematopoietic cells were then
counted and cultured at a concentration of 0.4–0.6 � 106 million cells per ml. The
cells were supplemented with 20 ng ml � 1 GM-CSF (PeproTech) on days 1, 3, 6
and 7 in the course of the 10-day culture. GM-DCs were then cultured in normal
RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% Pen/Strep and plated at a
concentration of 1 � 106 cells ml � 1, unless otherwise stated in the presence of
2 ng ml � 1 GM-CSF, and stimulated with 100 ng ml � 1 LPS (Enzo Life Sciences
serotype R515 TLRgrade) in the presence of the following compounds where
indicated: rapamycin (20 nM), DMOG (200 mM) (Cambridge Bioscience),
S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (250 mM) (Sigma), and SEITU (500 mM) (Cayman
Chemical). For glucose-deprivation assays, DCs were stimulated for 8 h in normal
RPMI, washed with glucose free RPMI and cultured in glucose-free RPMI
supplemented with 1 � concentration of MEM Vitamin Cocktail, 1 �
concentration of selenium/insulin/transferrin Cocktail (Invitrogen/Biosciences)
and 10% dialysed FCS (Fisher). Glucose and/or galactose was also added as
indicated. Nitrite levels in the GM-DCs culture media was determined using the
Griess reaction (Promega, Cat#: G2930).
BMDM culture. BMDMs were differentiated from bone marrow-derived
haematopoietic cells. Bone marrow was isolated from the femur and tibia-fibula
bones of C57/BLJ male mice, followed by RBC lysis. Bone marrow-derived
haematopoietic cells were then cultured in 10 cm Petri dishes at a concentration of
1 � 106 cells ml � 1 in a volume of 10 ml in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS,
1% penicillin/streptomycin for 6–9 days. The media was supplemented with 20% of
supernatant from the M-CSF-secreting L929 mouse fibroblast cell line.
BMDM/GM-DC transwell co-culture. For the co-culture experiments, WT or
Nos2 � / � GM-DCs were plated at a concentration of 2 � 106 cells in the presence
of 2 ng ml � 1 GM-CSF and stimulated with 100 ng ml � 1 LPS for 20 h before
analysis. WT BMDMs were cultured at a concentration of 1 � 106 ml � 1 in
Transwells (Corning Inc.) and were stimulated with 100 ng ml � 1 LPS and
10 ng ml � 1 IFNg. After 12 h of stimulation, BMDMs were treated with another
dose of IFNg (10 ng ml � 1). The transwells were then transferred into the wells
containing GM-DCs. GM-DCs and BMDMs were co-cultured for 4 h before the
GM-DCs were lysed for analysis.
T-cell responses. DCs were stimulated with LPS (100 ng ml � 1) and pulsed with
OVA 257–264 (SIINFEKL) 1 mg ml � 1 as indicated and washed extensively in
normal media before the addition of magnetic bead (Miltenyi biotech) sorted CD8
OTI T cells. T cells were added at a 5:1 T-cell/DC ratio unless indicated otherwise.
T-cell responses were analysed 48 h after addition to GM-DCs unless stated
otherwise. Proliferation of T cells was analysed by carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl
ester dilution. T cells were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-actetate
20 ng ml � 1 and ionomycin 1 mg ml � 1ml for 4 h before being fixed and permea-
bilized for intercellular staining of IFNg. For 2-NBDG uptake in T-cell/DC
co-culture experiments 2-NBDG was added directly to the co-culture wells for the
last hour of the experiment, at a final concentration of 35 mM. Cells were then
removed from wells, washed extensively and analysed by FACS following surface
staining.
Quantitative real-time PCR. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy RNA
Purification Kit (QIAGEN, cat #: 74106). Purified RNA was reverse transcribed
using qScript cDNA synthesis kit (Quanta Biosciences, cat #: 95047). Real-time
PCR was performed in triplicate using iQ SYBR Green-based detection on a ABI
7900HT fast qPCR machine. The derived mRNA levels were normalized using
RpLp0 mRNA levels. For primer sequences, see Supplementary Table 1.
Metabolic flux analysis. Mature BMDCs were plated (4 � 105 cells per well) in
Seahorse culture plate (precoated with Poly-L-Lysine to adhere cells) in 0.25 ml
culture media with GM-CSF at 2 ng ml � 1. After 1 h, a further 0.25 ml culture
media was added to wells to stimulate cells with media also containing reagents as
required with 2 ng ml � 1 GM-CSF. After 20 h stimulation, media was removed and
replaced with XF media (Seahorse Bioscience) supplemented with GM-CSF
(2 ng ml � 1) and glucose (10 mM). The cell plate was kept at 37 �C for 30 min in a
non-CO2 maintaining incubator before insertion into the Seahorse XFe24. The
Seahorse XFe24 takes measurements of the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR)
and the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) every 7.5 min. Over the course of analysis,
four inhibitors are added to determine which processes in metabolism are
responsible for the ECAR and OCR rates. The inhibitors, added in the listed
order, are oligomycin (2 mM) (inhibits the F0/F1 ATPase), p-trifluoromethoxy
carbonyl cyanide phenyl hydrazine (an uncoupling agent) (500 nM), antimycin A
(4 mM) and rotenone (100 nM) (inhibit complex 3 and 1, respectively) and
2-deoxy-D-glucose (30 mM; inhibits glycolysis). Metabolic rates were calculated
as follows: OXPHOS—basal OCR minus OCR after the addition of antimycin
A/rotenone; OXPHOS coupled to ATP synthesis—basal OCR minus OCR after the
addition of oligomycin; glycolysis—basal ECAR minus ECAR after the addition of
2DG.
In vivo DC–T-cell interaction. GM-DCs were stimulated for 1 h with LPS
(100 ng ml � 1) and SIINFEKL OVA peptide (1 mg ml � 1), washed extensively and
stained with Cell Tracker Violet (Biosciences Life Technologies). In all, 1 � 106
GM-DCs (optimized to give 30–200 GM-DCs in the draining lymph node) were
injected into the lateral tarsal region of C57/Bl6 mice. Four hours later, different
numbers of purified, carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester-stained CD8 OTI T
cells (1 � 105–5 � 106) were introduced by intravenous injection. After 18 h
draining, popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes were harvested. Lymph node cells
were fixed and analysed for the levels of pS6 in transferred GM-DC and OTI T cells
by flow cytometry.
Immunoblot analysis. Cells were lysed at 1 � 107 ml � 1 in Tris lysis buffer
containing 10 mM Tris pH 7.05, 50 mM NaCl, 30 mM Na pyrophosphate, 50 mM
NaF, 5 mM ZnCl2, 10% (v/v) Glycerol, 0.5% (v/v) Triton, 1 mM dithiothreitol and
protease inhibitors. Lysates were separated by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electro-
phoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were probed with the
following antibodies for 4 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 �C: phospho-S6
ribosomal proteinS235/236 (dilution 1:5,000), phospho-S6KT389 (108D2), total S6K,
Total PKB(11E7) (1:2,000), phospho-Acetyl-CoA CarboxylaseS79, total Acetyl-CoA

1:200 Santa Cruz Biotech), HIF-1a (dilution 1:2,500; Novus Technologies), and
SMC1 (dilution 1:5,000 Bethyl Laboratories) and then incubated with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG for 1 h at
room temperature. Original immunoblot scans can be seen in Supplementary
Fig. 7.
