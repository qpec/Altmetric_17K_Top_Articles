Summary
Background Retrospective studies provide conflicting interpretations of the effect of inherited genetic factors on the 
prognosis of patients with breast cancer. The primary aim of this study was to determine the effect of a germline 
BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation on breast cancer outcomes in patients with young-onset breast cancer. 
Methods We did a prospective cohort study of female patients recruited from 127 hospitals in the UK aged 40 years 
or younger at first diagnosis (by histological confirmation) of invasive breast cancer. Patients with a previous 
invasive malignancy (except non-melanomatous skin cancer) were excluded. Patients were identified within 
12 months of initial diagnosis. BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were identified using blood DNA collected at 
recruitment. Clinicopathological data, and data regarding treatment and long-term outcomes, including date and 
site of disease recurrence, were collected from routine medical records at 6 months, 12 months, and then annually 
until death or loss to follow-up. The primary outcome was overall survival for all BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation 
carriers (BRCA-positive) versus all non-carriers (BRCA-negative) at 2 years, 5 years, and 10 years after diagnosis. 
A prespecified subgroup analysis of overall survival was done in patients with triple-negative breast cancer. 
Recruitment was completed in 2008, and long-term follow-up is continuing.
Findings Between Jan 24, 2000, and Jan 24, 2008, we recruited 2733 women. Genotyping detected a pathogenic 
BRCA mutation in 338 (12%) patients (201 with B RCA1, 137 with BRCA2). After a median follow-up of 8·2 years 
(IQR 6·0–9·9), 651 (96%) of 678 deaths were due to breast cancer. There was no significant difference in overall 
survival between BRCA-positive and BRCA-negative patients in multivariable analyses at any timepoint (at 
2 years: 97·0% [95% CI 94·5–98·4] vs 96·6% [95·8–97·3]; at 5 years: 83·8% [79·3–87·5] vs 85·0% [83·5–86·4]; at 
10 years: 73·4% [67·4–78·5] vs 70·1% [67·7–72·3]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·96 [95% CI 0·76–1·22]; p=0·76). Of 
558 patients with triple-negative breast cancer, BRCA mutation carriers had better overall survival than 
non-carriers at 2 years (95% [95% CI 89–97] vs 91% [88–94]; HR 0·59 [95% CI 0·35–0·99]; p=0·047) but not 
5 years (81% [73–87] vs 74% [70–78]; HR 1·13 [0·70–1·84]; p=0·62) or 10 years (72% [62–80] vs 69% [63–74]; HR 
2·12 [0·82–5·49]; p= 0·12).
Interpretation Patients with young-onset breast cancer who carry a BRCA mutation have similar survival as 
non-carriers. However, BRCA mutation carriers with triple-negative breast cancer might have a survival advantage 
during the first few years after diagnosis compared with non-carriers. Decisions about timing of additional surgery 
aimed at reducing future second primary-cancer risks should take into account patient prognosis associated with the 
first malignancy and patient preferences.

Introduction
Although only 5% of breast cancers are diagnosed in 
women aged younger than 40 years, a high proportion of 
deaths from breast cancer occur in this age group, which 
includes a higher number of patients who carry a 
pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation compared with 
patients with onset of breast cancer at an older age.1–3 
Second primary breast cancers are more frequent in 
high-risk gene carriers, and this higher frequency drives 
early genetic testing to inform surgical decision making; 
however, whether a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation 
has independent prognostic implications after an initial 
cancer diagnosis is unclear.
BRCA1 loss of function mutations are associated 
with high-histological-grade, oestrogen-receptor-negative, 
progesterone-receptor-negative, and HER2-negative (triple 
negative) breast cancer with a basal-like gene expression 
profile.4 BRCA2-associated breast tumours are usually 
high-grade, oestrogen-receptor positive, and HER2-
negative.5,6 BRCA1 mutation carriers have been reported 
to have enhanced sensitivity to neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
with cytotoxic drugs.7

Published studies and meta-analyses have reported 
better, worse, and similar outcomes for patients with a 
BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation compared with patients with 
sporadic breast cancer.8–14 A comprehensive meta-analysis 
of 66 studies of breast cancer survival in patients with a 
BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation compared with non-carrier 
patients or the general breast cancer population, which 
assessed study quality as well as outcome data, concluded 
that “it is not yet possible to draw evidence based 
conclusions about the association between BRCA1 [or] 
BRCA2 
mutation 
carriership 
and 
breast 
cancer 
prognosis”.12 We undertook the Prospective Outcomes in 
Sporadic versus Hereditary breast cancer (POSH) study, 
the primary aim of which was to determine the effect of 
inherited BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations on outcomes in 
patients with young-onset breast cancer.15,16
Methods
Study design and participants
We did a prospective cohort study at 127 hospitals in the 
UK (appendix pp 1–2). We recruited young women (aged 
18–40 years) diagnosed with primary breast cancer in the 
UK. Patients were eligible if they were diagnosed with 
invasive breast cancer aged 40 years or younger. Potential 
recruits were identified by local breast cancer clinicians, 
nurses, or research clinical trial practitioners within 
12 months of initial diagnosis of invasive breast cancer 
and the date of diagnosis was defined as the first 
histological confirmation of invasive breast cancer. All 
histological subtypes, disease stages (I–IV), comorbidities, 
and performance statuses were permitted. Patients with a 
previous invasive malignancy (with the exception of non-
melanomatous skin cancer) were excluded. 
Written informed consent was obtained from all 
participants. Ethical approval was granted in 2000 (MREC 
00/6/69) and the study was approved for recruitment as 
part of the UK National Cancer Research Network 
(NCRN) portfolio in 2002, subsequently the NIHR 
portfolio. The protocol was published in 2007
.15
Procedures
All patients received treatment according to local 
protocols. Details of personal characteristics, tumour 
pathology, disease stage, and surgical and cytotoxic 
treatment data were collected from medical records at 
study entry. Family history was collected by questionnaire. 
The BOADICEA algorithm, without adjustment for 
pathological subtype, was used to estimate the probability 
that an individual might carry a BRCA1 or BRCA2 
pathogenic variant.17 Pathology and imaging data were 
verified with copies of the original reports from sites. For 
patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the 
initial diameter of the tumour was derived from 
radiological reports.
The oestrogen-receptor, progesterone-receptor, and 
HER2-receptor status of the primary tumours was 
determined from reports of local routine pathology 
testing of diagnostic core biopsies or tumour resections 
for clinical use. Hormone-receptor concentrations 
equivalent to an Allred score of 3 or more were 
categorised as positive. Immunohistochemical staining 
of tissue microarrays in some cases enabled clinical 
source data for oestrogen-receptor, progesterone-receptor, 
and HER2-receptor statuses to be corroborated; tissue 
microarray scores were used to supplement missing 
datapoints for these receptors.16
Research in context
Evidence before this study
At the initiation of this cohort study (Dec 3, 1999), we searched 
the PubMed database using the search terms [BRCA1 OR 
BRCA2] AND [breast cancer or breast neoplasm] AND [survival 
OR prognosis OR mortality] and identified a few published 
retrospective studies reporting prognosis in BRCA mutation 
carriers. On Dec 5, 2016, we did another PubMed search for 
studies of patients who carried a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and 
their prognosis, using the following search terms: “(BRCA) AND 
(survival or prognosis or outcome or mortality) AND (breast 
neoplasms or breast neoplasm or breast cancer or breast 
tumour)”. Our search was not limited by date or language. We 
also hand-searched references cited in review papers for 
additional papers. Previous studies and meta-analyses have 
reported inconsistent effects of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations 
on the outcomes of early breast cancer with better, worse, and 
similar outcomes for patients with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation 
compared with patients with sporadic breast cancer. These 
conflicting results might be explained by methodological issues 
with ascertainment biases introduced by retrospective and 
selective identification of cases, incomplete genetic testing, 
small numbers, an absence of adjustment for clinical variables, 
including treatment, and short follow-up.
Added value of this study
POSH is, to our knowledge, the largest prospective cohort study 
to compare breast cancer outcomes of patients with a BRCA1 or 
BRCA2 mutation with patients with sporadic cancer. Our 
findings showed that patients with young-onset breast cancer 
who have a BRCA mutation have a similar overall survival to 
non-carriers. However, in patients with triple-negative breast 
cancer, BRCA mutation carriers might have a survival advantage 
compared with non-carriers during the first few years after 
diagnosis. Our study was strengthened by unbiased recruitment, 
universal and central genetic testing at the end of the study, and 
comprehensive pathological, clinical, and follow-up data.
Implications of all the available evidence
Decisions about timing of risk-reducing surgery should take 
into account primary tumour prognosis and patient 
preference.

DNA for genotyping was extracted from whole blood 
samples 
submitted 
at 
recruitment. 
A 
multiplex 
amplicon-based library preparation system, Fluidigm 
Access Array (Fluidigm UK, Cambridge, UK), targeted a 
panel of breast-cancer-susceptibility genes (including 
BRCA1, BRCA2, and TP53) for sequencing using an 
Illumina HiSeq2500 Next Generation Sequencing 
Platform (Illumina, Little Chesterford, UK; appendix 
pp 20–21). Targeted-sequence capture cannot reliably 
identify large exonic deletions or duplications, therefore 
multiplex ligation probe analysis was used for patients 
who met current UK guideline thresholds for clinical 
genetic testing.17,18 Predicted protein truncating variants 
(frameshift, nonsense, and canonical-splice site and large 
rearrangements) plus other variants (mainly mis-sense) 
unequivocally defined as pathogenic on the basis of 
multiple lines of evidence and expert review were 
assigned 
to 
the 
BRCA-mutation 
carrier 
group 
(BRCA-positive). All pathogenic variants were confirmed 
by Sanger sequencing. All other patients, including those 
with BRCA1 or BRCA2 variants of uncertain significance 
or very low penetrance, were assigned to the same group 
as no mutation found (BRCA-negative) or excluded if 
they were found to carry a pathogenic variant of TP53. 
For the purposes of this analysis, mutations in other 
breast cancer genes were not curated.
The study protocol and patient information specified 
that patients would not be informed of the research 
genetic-testing results; however, patient information 
sheets gave information about seeking clinical genetic 
referral. Clinical referrals for genetic testing were made 
by the treating physician according to local protocols. 
Genetic test reports for the study patients generated by 
UK 
National 
Health 
Service 
(NHS) 
diagnostic 
laboratories were collected as part of the medical record.
Detailed clinical follow-up data, including date and site 
of disease recurrence, were obtained from medical 
records at 6 months, 12 months, and annually thereafter, 
until death or loss to follow-up. Patients were flagged in 
the NHS medical research information service for 
automatic notification of date and cause of death.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was overall survival, defined as the 
time from first diagnosis to death from any cause. The 
secondary outcomes were distant disease-free survival, 
defined as time from first diagnosis to first distant 
disease excluding local (in breast) recurrence. 
Statistical analysis
The original study sample size of a minimum of 
2000 patients was estimated based on a prevalence of 
BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic mutations of 10%, and an 
absolute difference in event rate at 2 years between 
mutation carriers and non-carriers of 10% (20% in 
mutation carriers compared with 10% in sporadic 
cases).15 We also considered a prevalence of BRCA1 or 
BRCA2 mutations of 5% and 15%, and larger sample 
sizes. Good recruitment and data returns enabled us to 
continue study recruitment beyond 2000 participants 
providing sufficient power for multivariable analyses.
We did the statistical analyses according to a prespecified 
plan (appendix pp 22–31).19 The analysis population 
included all eligible patients recruited to the cohort who 
had available data for the primary tumour and genotyping, 
were aged 40 years or younger at the date of diagnosis, did 
not carry a TP53 gene, and who did not present with 
metastatic 
disease 
at 
presentation 
(M1 
stage). 
A prespecified subgroup of the analysis population was 
patients with triple-negative breast cancer (ie, oestrogen-
receptor-negative, HER2-negative, and progesterone-
receptor-negative or unknown). All analyses were done 
for both the overall analysis population and the triple-
negative breast cancer subgroup population, unless 
specified otherwise. Key patient data were described by 
BRCA mutation status, and formal comparisons by 
BRCA mutation status were done using Mann-Whitney 
tests (for continuous variables) and Pearson χ² tests (for 
categorical variables) for patients with complete data. We 
used Kaplan-Meier plots to show survival data by BRCA 
status at 2, 5, and 10 years. The 2-year comparison was 
chosen because this timepoint was specified for the 
original sample size; the 5-year and 10-year comparisons 
were chosen because they are commonly used in such 
studies and are clinically relevant timepoints. Patients 
who did not have an event were censored at the date of 
their last follow-up. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for

and time-dependent effect were explored to obtain the 
best-model fit. All missing data were assumed to be either 
missing at random or missing completely at random, and 
censoring 
was 
assumed 
to 
be 
non-informative. 
Prespecified sensitivity analyses included the generation 
of corresponding complete-case multivariable analysis 
model results. 
Post-hoc sensitivity analyses were done to explore the 
possible reasons for some of the results in the 
triple-negative breast cancer group. Additionally, to 
investigate the degree of potential bias from time of 
diagnosis to blood draw for genetic testing at 
registration, a multivariable analysis model adjusting 
for the time from diagnosis to blood draw was 
generated accordingly for the analysis population only. 
We considered if the longer survival of BRCA mutation 
carriers with triple-negative breast cancer could be due 
to a beneficial effect of risk-reducing surgery in BRCA

carriers, so we repeated the analysis in this subgroup 
excluding 
patients 
who 
underwent 
bilateral 
mastectomy within the first year after diagnosis. A 
further sensitivity analysis was done to compare the 
pattern of improved survival at an early timepoint with 
apparently worse survival in the long term by excluding 
patients who developed a new primary breast or 
ovarian cancer.
We did all analyses with Stata, version 14.2, and 
multiple 
imputation 
was 
incorporated

the

Results
Between Jan 24, 2000, and Jan 24, 2008, we recruited 
3021 eligible women, of whom 2733 (91%) were included 
in the analysis population, and 288 (9%) were excluded 
(figure 1; appendix p 11). We included all data received 
until July 26, 2016. Of 2721 patients for whom 
presentation was recorded, 45 (2%) were recorded as 
being enrolled in a surveillance programme, and 33 (1%) 
were recorded as having screen-detected breast cancer. 
Screening was offered according to local protocols; 
national guidelines were not formally established until 
after recruitment ended.
338 (12%) of 2733 patients included in the analysis 
population had either a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, of 
whom 44 (13%) had large-copy-number variants 
(appendix pp 3–7). 75 (22%) of 338 patients did not 
meet current family history or pathology based genetic-
testing guidelines.18 Referral for a clinical genetics 
consultation and BRCA testing occurred for 388 
patients (14%), of whom 182 (47%) had a pathogenic 
mutation. Immuno 
histo 
chemical staining of tissue 
microarrays in 1336 cases, during 2012 and 2016, 
enabled clinical source data for oestrogen-receptor, 
progesterone-receptor, and HER2-receptor statuses to 
be corroborated.
The median time from breast cancer diagnosis to study 
registration blood draw was 5·5 months (IQR 3·2–10·7). 
There 
were 
several 
significant 
clinicopathological 
differences between BRCA-positive and BRCA-negative 
patients, and between BRCA1 mutation carriers and 
BRCA2 mutation carriers (table 1). The most commonly 
used chemotherapy regimen was anthracycline with or 
without taxanes. Of the 2733 patients in the analysis 
population, 558 (20%) had triple-negative breast cancer. 
BRCA mutations were identified in 136 (24%) of patients 
with triple-negative breast cancer, of whom 123 (90%) had a 
BRCA1 mutation. Differences in tumour characteristics 
between BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers were also 
noted in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (table 2).
Median follow-up was 8·2 years (IQR 6·0–9·9); 
91 (3%) patients were lost to follow-up. Contralateral 
breast tumours occurred in 151 (6%) patients: in 
37 (18%) of 201 BRCA1 mutation carriers, 17 (12%) of 
137 BRCA2 mutation carriers, and 97 (4%) of 
2395 
BRCA-negative 
patients. 
Median 
time 
to 
contralateral breast cancer was 3·0 years (IQR 1·5–4·8) in 
BRCA-positive patients and 2·7 years (1·2–5·3) in BRCA-
negative patients. 752 (28%) women developed a distant 
recurrence. Of 678 deaths, 651 (96%) were due to breast 
cancer. Deaths due to non-breast malignancies included

six (3%) of 201 new primary cancers in BRCA1 mutation 
carriers (three ovarian, one primary peritoneal, one oeso-
phageal, and one pancreatic) and 12 (<1%) of 
2395 malignancies in BRCA-negative patients (four 
haema 
tological, three lung, and one each of brain, 
colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, and sarcoma; appendix p 8). 
There were no deaths attributed to second primary 
cancers among BRCA2 mutation carriers.
Overall survival was 97·0% (95% CI 94·5–98·4) in 
BRCA-positive patients versus 96·6% (95·8–97·3) in 
BRCA-negative patients at 2 years; 83·8% (79·3–87·5) 
versus 
85·0% 
(83·5–86·4) 
at 
5 
years; 
and 
73·4% (67·4–78·5) versus 70·1% (67·7–72·3) at 10 years 
(figure 2). There was no difference in overall survival 
between groups either before or after adjusting for known 
prognostic factors, including adjustments for ethnicity 
and body-mass index (BMI; univariable analysis negative 
vs positive HR 0·99 [95% CI 0·78–1·24], p=0·90; 
multivariable analysis HR 0·96 [0·76–1·22], p=0·76). 
Similar results were noted when comparing distant 
disease-free 
survival 
between 
BRCA-positive 
and 
BRCA-negative groups (appendix p 12). Additionally, 
comparison of overall survival in BRCA-negative patients 
versus BRCA1 or BRCA2 carriers separately showed 
similar results (appendix pp 13–14).
In the subgroup of 558 patients with triple-negative 
breast cancer, 159 (28%) women developed a distant 
recurrence, 153 (27%) died, and all deaths were due to 
breast cancer. The estimated hazard for death after 
diagnosis of triple-negative breast cancer varied over 
time (appendix p 32). In the triple-negative breast cancer 
subgroup, overall survival was significantly better at 
2 
years 
for 
BRCA-positive 
patients 
than 
for 
BRCA-negative patients (95% [95% CI 89–97]) vs 
91% [88–94]; multivariable analysis flexible parametric 
survival model HR 0·59 [95% CI 0·35–0·99], p=0·047). 
Overall survival at 5 years was 81% (95% CI 73–87) versus 
74% (70–78; multivariable analysis flexible parametric 
survival model HR 1·13 [95% CI 0·70–1·84], p=0·62); 
and at 10 years was 72% (62–80) versus 69% (63–74; 
multivariable analysis flexible parametric survival model 
HR 2·12 [95% CI 0·82–5·49], p=0·12; figure 3). For 
distant disease-free survival, however, the difference 
between BRCA-positive and BRCA-negative patients was 
not significant (appendix p 15). Inclusion of time from 
diagnosis to registration blood draw in multivariable 
analyses did not affect the results (appendix p 16). For 
analyses of both the overall population and the subgroup 
of patients with triple-negative breast cancer, results with 
imputation were almost identical to complete case results 
(appendix pp 9–10). Results from tests of proportional 
hazards are also in the appendix (p 17).
A post-hoc, multivariable sensitivity analysis of overall 
survival in patients with triple-negative breast cancer 
excluding 31 (6%) patients (21 BRCA-positive and ten 
BRCA-negative) who underwent bilateral mastectomy 
within the first year after diagnosis showed a significant 
difference in overall survival at 2 years for BRCA-positive 
versus BRCA-negative patients (95% [95% CI 89–98] vs 
91% [88–94]; HR 0·52 [95% CI 0·29–0·91], p=0·023). 
However, there was no significant difference for 5-year 
overall survival (83% [95% CI 74–89] vs 74% [69–78]; 
HR 0·98 [95% CI 0·58–1·65], p=0·94; appendix p 18).

multivariable analysis was adjusted for age, body-mass index (BMI; kg/m²), grade, tumour size, HER2 status, 
oestrogen-receptor status, ethnicity, and use of taxane chemotherapy. Groups without a reference were assessed 
as a continuous variable. The dashed line separates the univariable analysis (UVA) from the multivariable analysis

We also repeated the primary analysis in patients with 
triple-negative breast cancer excluding 37 (7%) patients 
who developed a new primary breast or ovarian cancer. 
Overall survival at 10 years for BRCA-positive versus 
BRCA-negative patients was 78% (95% CI 69–85) versus 
69% (64–74; HR 1·24 [95% CI 0·39–3·96], p=0·73; 
appendix p 19).
Discussion
The POSH prospective cohort study showed no 
significant difference in overall survival or distant 
disease-free survival between patients carrying a BRCA1 
or BRCA2 mutation and patients without these mutations 
after a diagnosis of breast cancer. These results did not 
vary between unadjusted or adjusted analyses, including 
adjustments for ethnicity and BMI.21,22 Following a 
diagnosis of early breast cancer, BRCA mutation carriers 
are frequently offered additional management options 
including 
bilateral 
mastectomy. 
Any 
prognostic 
implication of carrying a BRCA mutation for primary 
treatment is important to clarify to facilitate clinician and 
patient decisions around the optimum timing of 
additional surgery. Furthermore, clinical trials of 
treatments that are specifically targeted toward BRCA 
mutation carriers might need to take into account any 
effect of BRCA mutational status on primary treatment 
outcomes.
To our knowledge, this is the largest prospective study 
to report the prognostic implication of germline BRCA 
mutations and the only one with a preplanned analysis of 
patients presenting with triple-negative tumours. Our 
results are in broad agreement with more recent 
studies,8–10,23 but others have reported conflicting 
results.24–26 Ascertainment biases introduced by retro-
spective and selective identification of cases, incomplete 
genetic testing, small numbers, absence of adjustments 
for clinical variables including treatment, and short 
follow-up probably explain many discrepancies, although 
some studies have generally used stronger methods.11–14
The 
percentage 
of 
BRCA-positive 
patients 
in 
POSH (12%) was higher than anticipated from historical 
studies of patients diagnosed aged 40 years and younger, 
perhaps because of more sensitive mutation-testing 
options.1 However, only 14% of all patients had clinical 
genetic testing. The ratio of patients with BRCA1 to 
BRCA2 mutations was 1·5 to 1, which is similar to that 
reported in other large western population-based 
cohorts.2,23 Deaths due to other malignancies were low in 
frequency in all groups reflecting the young age group; 
however, causes of deaths in patients who were 
BRCA1-positive included potentially preventable ovarian 
cancers at age 41–46 years. Bilateral risk-reducing 
mastectomy is not a necessary part of treating a unilateral 
breast cancer but unilateral mastectomy might enable 
breast radiotherapy to be omitted. Discussion about 
future primary cancer prevention during primary breast 
cancer treatment should take into account individual 
circumstances, including the likely tumour prognosis 
and the physical and psychological implications of more 
extensive surgery. In the POSH cohort, immediate 
bilateral mastectomy was not associated with improved 
survival, although the reported use of risk-reducing 
surgery was low; bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was 
recorded in 32 patients and bilateral mastectomies in 
107 patients.27 This probably reflects the low level of 
clinical testing at the time of the study. Although risk-
reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is highly 
effective at reducing ovarian cancer incidence, the risk of

primary peritoneal cancer is not reduced and studies 
indicate that the previously reported effect of this 
procedure on future breast cancer risk in BRCA1 and 
BRCA2 mutation carriers might have been overestimated 
because of uncorrected bias.28
Our analysis of the 558 patients with triple-negative 
breast cancer in our cohort showed an intriguing 
difference in overall survival over the first few years after 
diagnosis. BRCA mutation carriers were less likely to die 
from early breast cancer than non-carriers. This early 
survival advantage has also been observed among 
patients with ovarian cancer who are BRCA mutation 
carriers.29,30 If real, this advantage might reflect greater 
sensitivity 
of 
BRCA-mutant 
breast 
cancers 
to 
chemotherapy or the greater visibility of BRCA-mutant 
cancers to host immune attack.31 One theory that could 
explain the slight survival advantage for BRCA mutation 
carriers not undergoing immediate bilateral mastectomy 
is that a major surgical intervention might compromise 
host immunity at a time when this is particularly 
important 
for 
eradicating 
micrometastases. 
This 
hypothesis would need further exploration due to the 
small number of patients in this subgroup.
Results from several published studies have suggested 
that the DNA repair deficiency associated with BRCA 
mutations results in enhanced sensitivity to many 
chemotherapy agents, particularly higher response 
rates to platinum-based drugs, have occurred in both 
metastatic and neoadjuvant settings.4,7 Only 13 patients 
in our cohort were treated with platinum-based 
adjuvant regimens for early breast cancer, including 
one patient with a BRCA1 mutation and one with 
BRCA2.
Our study illustrates the high breast cancer mortality in 
this unscreened young population and the effect of 
known tumour and patient-prognostic characteristics  on 
mortality. Inevitably, there have been substantial changes 
in the management of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation 
carriers since the recruitment period of this study, 
including the exploration in trials of systemic therapies 
that exploit BRCA-null tumours, including platinum-
based drugs and PARP inhibitors. The association of 
BRCA mutations with improved early outcomes related 
to breast cancer in patients with triple-negative breast 
cancer has the potential to affect early results from clinical 
trials. As advanced genomic investigations increasingly 
become a part of routine oncological care, many patients 
with breast cancer now learn their BRCA mutation status 
close to the time of diagnosis. In many cancer centres, 
immediate or post-chemotherapy bilateral mastectomy 
has become an almost routine recommendation for 
BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers regardless of the 
size or focality of the presenting tumour. In the longer 
term, risk-reducing surgery, particularly for BRCA1 gene 
carriers is an appropriate management; in our analysis, 
the rising hazard for death in BRCA carriers over time 
was negated by removing from the analysis all patients 
who developed a second new primary breast or ovarian 
cancer during the follow-up period.
Clinicians need to consider short-term and long-term 
risks and benefits in discussing risk-reducing bilateral 
mastectomy with patients. The number of patients with 
triple-negative breast cancer who had immediate bilateral 
mastectomy in our cohort was small but our analysis 
suggests it is unlikely that the early bilateral mastectomy 
accounted for the early survival advantage in the 
BRCA mutation carriers with triple-negative breast 
cancer. With modern MRI-based breast screening, we 
conclude that patients who choose to delay additional 
surgery for 1 or 2 years until they are psychologically and 
physically recovered from their cancer treatment can be 
reassured that this choice is unlikely to lead to any 
substantial survival disadvantage. The importance of 
appropriately timed risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-
oophorectomy, for BRCA1 mutation carriers in particular, 
is clear, but should take plans for further pregnancy into 
account. Furthermore, risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-
oophorectomy in very young women will have negative 
health consequences as a result of oestrogen deprivation 
from an early age.
The strengths of the POSH study include the large 
cohort size, few missing data, and inclusion of patients 
with young-onset breast cancer, which led to a large 
number of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers and a 
high number of events, ensuring that the study was well 
powered for the main outcome analysis. Our study 
minimised many of the biases present in other studies 
by recruiting patients within the first year after diagnosis 
from oncology clinics nationally to minimise survival 
and selection bias and by establishing BRCA mutation 
status for all patients included in the analysis. POSH 
participants recruited from England represented 23% of 
the available population during the recruitment period 
and comparison with cancer registry data confirmed that 
the POSH cohort is representative of the wider 
population.16 Comprehensive details of pathology 
enabled us to do a separate analysis of outcome in 
patients with triple-negative breast tumours; a unique 
contribution to this field. We have previously reported 
the significant and independent prognostic effects of 
obesity and ethnicity on long-term outcomes in this 
young patient group, and this study is the only 
prospective study to date to include these host factors in 
multivariable analyses.21,22
Limitations of this study included the non-universal 
use of multiplex ligation probe analysis; we therefore 
cannot exclude the possibility that some structural BRCA 
variants were not identified. However, even clinical 
diagnostic mutation testing is not 100% sensitive because 
of occult mutations not amenable to current methods 
(eg, deep intronic splice variants); the investigation of 
BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene sequences in this cohort was 
more comprehensive than in most other publications. 
All participants were tested for TP53 mutations and

carriers were excluded from this analysis because of the 
high risk of non-breast malignancies. We acknowledge 
that other breast cancer susceptibility gene variants were 
not excluded; however, these were expected to be very low 
in frequency or low penetrance, and there is no evidence 
that they specifically affect prognosis. We had national 
outcome data up to a median 8·2 years. The treatments 
given reflected modern oncological practice with almost 
90% of patients receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant 
chemotherapy; in more than 95% of cases this was an 
anthracycline or anthracycline plus taxane combination 
regimen.
Other limitations of this study included restricting the 
main cohort to patients aged 40 years or younger at the 
time of diagnosis to enrich for BRCA mutation carriers. 
It is possible that observations in young-onset breast 
cancer patients might not translate to older ages at 
diagnosis. Progesterone-receptor testing was not done 
routinely in many UK centres during the period of 
recruitment and supplementary data were derived from 
tissue microarrays rather than full tumour sections. The 
relevance of triple-negative breast cancer in terms of 
biology and treatment has only become apparent since 
the POSH study was designed, so the study was not 
powered for this as the primary outcome; notably, the 
only difference in overall survival in this study was seen 
between mutation carriers and non-carriers in this 
subgroup. Recommendations for adjuvant treatment in 
the UK changed over the course of recruitment, with 
taxanes being recommended for node-positive disease 
from 2006 and adjuvant trastuzumab for HER2-positive 
breast cancer routinely available only from 2006. 
Although we specifically collected information at 5 years 
about risk-reducing surgery, we cannot exclude the 
possibility 
that 
risk-reducing 
mastectomy 
and 
oophorectomy might have been done at different 
hospitals from the recruiting cancer centre (eg, at 
specialist plastic surgery or gynaecological units).
This study confirmed that patients diagnosed with 
invasive breast cancer aged 18–40 years have a high 
breast-cancer-specific mortality, and a high proportion 
are BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. We found no 
clear evidence that either BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline 
mutations significantly affect overall survival with breast 
cancer after adjusting for known prognostic factors. 
Decisions about timing of risk-reducing surgery should 
take into account primary tumour prognosis and patient 
preference. BRCA mutation carriers presenting with 
triple-negative breast cancer might have an improved 
survival during the first few years after diagnosis 
compared with non-carriers, although immediate 
bilateral mastectomy did not account for this advantage. 
Finally, analysis of early outcome data from trials 
exploring BRCA-deficient tumour treatment in patients 
with triple-negative breast cancer should be interpreted 
with caution in view of the possible early survival 
advantage for BRCA mutation carriers.
