 Sex Differences in the Association Between Measures of General and
Central Adiposity and the Risk of Myocardial Infarction: Results From
the UK Biobank
Sanne A. E. Peters, PhD; Sophie H. Bots, MSc; Mark Woodward, PhD
Background-—There are substantial differences in the distribution of adipose tissue between women and men. We assessed the
sex-specific relationships and their differences between measures of general and central adiposity and the risk of incident
myocardial infarction (MI).
Methods and Results-—Between 2006 and 2010, the UK Biobank recruited over 500 000 participants aged 40 to 69 years across
the United Kingdom. During 7 years of follow-up, 5710 cases of MI (28% women) were recorded among 265 988 women and
213 622 men without a history of cardiovascular disease at baseline. Cox regression models yielded adjusted hazard ratios for MI
associated with body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-height ratio. There was an approximate log-
linear relationship between measures of general and central adiposity and the risk of MI in both sexes. A 1-SD higher in body mass
index, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-height ratio, respectively, were associated with hazard ratios
(confidence intervals) for MI of 1.22 (1.17; 1.28), 1.35 (1.28; 1.42), 1.49 (1.39; 1.59), and 1.34 (1.27; 1.40) in women and of 1.28
(1.23; 1.32), 1.28 (1.23; 1.33), 1.36 (1.30; 1.43), and 1.33 (1.28; 1.38) in men. The corresponding women-to-men ratios of hazard
ratios were 0.96 (0.91; 1.02), 1.07 (1.00; 1.14), 1.15 (1.06; 1.24), and 1.03 (0.97; 1.09).
Conclusions-—Although general and central adiposity measures each have profound deleterious effects on the risk of MI in both
sexes, a higher waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio conferred a greater excess risk of MI in women than in men. Waist-to-hip
ratio was more strongly associated with the risk of MI than body mass index in both sexes, especially in women. (J Am Heart

Key Words: adipose tissue • men • myocardial infarction • women
E
xcess adipose tissue is a major, and increasingly
common, risk factor for chronic diseases, including
myocardial infarction (MI), the leading cause of death
worldwide.1,2 In 2016, the World Health Organization esti-
mated that more than 40% of women and 39% of men
worldwide were overweight (defined as a body mass index
[BMI] of >25 kg/m2) and that over 15% of women and 11% of
men were obese (BMI >30 kg/m2).3
BMI is the most widely used measure to assess the
prevalence of overweight and obesity across populations and
to quantify the detrimental effects of excess adipose tissue on
the risk of MI in later life. However, BMI is a measure of
general adiposity and does not discriminate between adipose
tissue present in visceral and subcutaneous areas. Yet, as
compared with subcutaneous adipose tissue, visceral adipose
tissue is more metabolically active, is closely related to insulin
resistance, and may be more strongly associated with
cardiometabolic risk.4,5 Measures of central adiposity and
body composition, including waist circumference, waist-to-hip
ratio, and waist-to-height ratio, may, therefore, be better
suited than BMI for quantifying the etiological relationship
between adiposity and cardiovascular disease. Although some
studies have reported that measures of central adiposity are
more strongly related to cardiovascular risk than BMI,6-10
others have found minimal differences across anthropometric
measures and reported that each measure was similarly
associated with the risk of future MI.11,12

 There are substantial sex differences in body fat distribu-
tion, with a predominance of subcutaneous fat in women and
visceral fat in men.13,14 Although the association between
BMI and the risk of MI is broadly similar between women and
men,15 it is conceivable that there is a sex differential in the
effects of central adiposity on the risk of MI—with potentially
stronger effects in women than men. However, most previous
studies did not report the associations between measures of
general and central adiposity and the risk of MI separately for
women and men. Even when sex-specific results on multiple
anthropometric measures were available, direct comparisons
between measures for women and men separately were
lacking.
The aim of this study was, thus, to directly assess the sex-
specific relationship between measures of general and central
adiposity and the risk of incident MI among women and men
without a prior history of cardiovascular disease included in
the UK Biobank.
Methods
Transparency
This research has been conducted using the UK Biobank
Resource (Application Number: 2495). Researchers can apply
to use the UK Biobank resource by making their own
application. The analytic methods and study materials will be
made available to other researchers for purposes of repro-
ducing the results or replicating the procedure on request.
Study Population
The UK Biobank is a large prospective, population-based
cohort study.16,17 Between 2006 and 2010 UK Biobank
investigators sent postal invitations to over 9 million individ-
uals registered with the UK’s National Health Service who
were aged 40 to 69 years and lived within �25 miles (40 km)
of at least one of 22 assessment centers located throughout
England, Wales, and Scotland. Over 500 000 women and men
(5.5% response rate) consented to participate in the study and
visited an assessment center between 2006 and 2010.
Although the cohort is not representative of the general
population, it is well designed to reliably detect generalizable
associations between a wide range of baseline characteristics
and health outcomes due to the sufficiently large numbers of
participants across the full distribution of exposures. Partic-
ipants provided informed consent electronically and com-
pleted questionnaires on their lifestyle, environment, and
medical history, had physical and functional measures
performed, and had samples of blood, urine, and saliva
collected. UK Biobank has obtained Research Tissue Bank
approval from its governing Research Ethics Committee, as
recommended by the National Research Ethics Service. No
separate ethics approval was required. Participants with a
history of cardiovascular disease at baseline (n=20 100) or
BMI <15 or >60 kg/m2 were excluded (n=2918).
Adiposity Measures
Trained staff used standardized procedures and regularly
calibrated equipment to obtain the body size measurements.
Waist circumference at the level of the umbilicus was
measured using a Wessex nonstretchable sprung tape
measure. Hip circumference was measured using the same
tape
measure.
Standing
height
was
measured
with
a
Seca 202 height measure after participants had removed
their shoes. Body weight was measured using the Tanita BC-
418 MA body composition analyzer after shoes and heavy
outer clothing were removed. BMI was calculated by dividing
weight (kilograms) over height (meters) squared; waist-to-hip
ratio was calculated by dividing the waist circumference by
the
hip
circumference;
and
waist-to-height
ratio
was
calculated by dividing the waist circumference by standing
height.
Study Outcomes
The study end point was the incidence of fatal or nonfatal MI,
as defined by the UK Biobank. Follow-up started at inclusion
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Measures of central adiposity, but not of general adiposity,
were more strongly associated with the risk of myocardial
infarction in women than in men.
• Measures of central adiposity, particularly waist-to-hip ratio,
were more strongly associated with the risk of myocardial
infarction than general adiposity, especially among women.
• Thus, this study suggests that the sex dimorphism in the
quantity and distribution of adipose tissue not only results in
differences in body shape between women and men but
may also have differential implications for the risk of
myocardial infarction in later life.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Compared with body mass index, measures of central
adiposity may be a better indicator of the risk of myocardial
infarction associated with adiposity in women and also in
men.
• Insight into the sexual dimorphism in adiposity will yield
insights into the biological mechanisms and could inform
sex-specific interventions to treat and halt the obesity
epidemic.

 in the UK Biobank study (the baseline) and ended on March 1,
2016 or on the first fatal or nonfatal MI for all participants.
Outcome adjudication involved linkage with hospital admis-
sions data in England, Scotland, and Wales and national death
register data to identify the date of the first known MI after
baseline. Incident MI was defined by codes I21, I22, I23, I24.1
or I25.2 in the 10th revision of the International Classification
of Diseases (ICD-10).
Statistical Analyses
Baseline characteristics are presented as means (standard
deviation) for continuous variables and as percentages for
categorical variables. Pearson correlation coefficients were
obtained for each pair of adiposity measures. Repeat body
size measures, which were collected on average 4 years
after the baseline assessment in a reasonably representative
sample of 20 277 individuals, were used to obtain the sex-
specific mean differences (standard deviation) in body size
measures between the baseline assessment and first repeat
assessment. Cox regression models were used to obtain
hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals using MI
associated with each of the adiposity measures, separately
for
women
and
men.
Models
were
adjusted
for
age
(continuous), Townsend deprivation index (continuous), and
smoking status (categorical). The first 2 years of follow-up
were excluded from the analyses to minimize the effect of
latent disease. HRs were derived in fifths of the distribution
of the adiposity measure, apart from BMI, where predefined
categories were used. In each case the reference group was
chosen to be women in the second lowest adiposity
measure group. Confidence intervals were estimated using
floating absolute risks for comparisons involving more than
2 groups.18 Given that the relationships were approximately
log-linear, further analyses were conducted as the sexes-
combined HR per 1-SD higher adiposity (for each measure).
The sexes-combined SDs were 4.76 for BMI, 13.4 for waist
circumference, 0.09 for waist-to-hip ratio, and 0.08 for
waist-to-height ratio. An interaction term was added to each
model to evaluate whether the HRs differed between the
sexes. Estimated differences in the ratios of HRs between
measures of adiposity were computed, by sex, with 95%
confidence intervals of the differences derived through
bootstrapping with 500 replicates. Subgroup analyses were
conducted to obtain the sex-specific HRs and their ratios by
age group (<60 years versus ≥60 years), socioeconomic
status (Townsend deprivation index > �0.56 [“lower”] versus
Townsend deprivation index ≤ �0.56 [“higher”]), and BMI
(<25 kg/m²
versus
≥25 kg/m2).
Differences
across
subgroups were tested by adding, for the sex-specific HRs,
2-way interaction terms, and, for the women-to-men ratios,
3-way interaction terms to the model. All analyses were
performed using R version 3.3.1 (R Foundation, Vienna,
Austria).
Results
In total, 479 610 (55% women) individuals with a mean age of
56 years at recruitment were included (Table 1). The mean
BMI was 27 kg/m2 in women and 28 kg/m2 in men. The
mean waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-
height ratio, respectively, were 85 cm, 0.82, and 0.52 in
women and 97 cm, 0.93, and 0.55 in men. Correlation
coefficients among BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-
height ratio were 0.88 and above for both sexes. Correlations
with waist-to-hip ratio were 0.46 in women and 0.59 in men
for BMI, 0.75 in women and 0.80 in men for waist
circumference, and 0.75 in women and 0.80 in men for
waist-to-height ratio (Table 2). Mean differences in body size
measures between the baseline and repeat assessment were
small and similar between the sexes (Table S1).
During a mean follow-up of 7.1 years, 5710 cases of MI
(28% women) were recorded, including 1292 (25% women)
events that occurred within 2 years of follow-up. In both
women and men there was an approximate log-linear
relationship between all measures of general and central
adiposity and the risk of incident MI, notwithstanding a

 flattening of the association at lower levels of adiposity
(Figure 1 and Table S2).
A 1-SD higher BMI was associated with a HR for MI of 1.22
(1.17; 1.28) in women and 1.28 (1.23; 1.32) in men
(P for interaction=0.15), with no evidence for differences in
strengths or direction of the association by age or socioeco-
nomic status (Table S3 and Figure 2). A 1-SD higher waist
circumference was more strongly associated with the risk of
MI in women than in men, although the difference just
reached statistical significance; the HR was 1.35 (1.28; 1.42)
in women and 1.28 (1.23; 1.33) in men (P for interac-
tion=0.048). The corresponding women-to-men ratio of HRs
was 1.07 (1.00; 1.14). Although this sex difference was also
observed among those aged <60 years at recruitment, those
with a higher socioeconomic status, and in individuals with a
BMI of 25 kg/m2 or above, but not among their counterparts,
there was no statistical evidence for a 3-way interaction
between sex, waist circumference, and these subgroups
(Figure 2). A 1-SD higher waist-to-hip ratio was associated
with a HR of MI of 1.49 (1.39; 1.59) in women and 1.36 (1.30;
1.43) in men (P for interaction=0.001), with a corresponding
women-to-men ratio of HRs of 1.15 (1.06; 1.24). Although
there was some variation in the magnitude of this sex
difference across subgroups, these differences did not reach
statistical significance. The association between a 1-SD
higher waist-to-height ratio and the risk of MI was similar
between the sexes and did not vary materially by age,
socioeconomic status, and BMI; the HR was 1.34 (1.27; 1.40)
in women and 1.33 (1.28; 1.38) in men (P for interac-
tion=0.38).
In women, higher values of central adiposity (ie, waist
circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-height ratio)
were associated with a 10% to 20% greater risk of MI than
were higher values of BMI. Of these, waist-to-hip ratio was
more strongly associated with MI than waist circumference
and
waist-to-height
ratio
(Figure 3). Differences
in
the
strength of the association with MI across measures of
adiposity were smaller in men. However, waist-to-hip ratio
was also significantly more strongly associated with MI than
BMI and waist circumference but not waist-to-height ratio.
Discussion
This large prospective study among 480 000 women and men
demonstrates that higher levels of measures of central and
general adiposity are each associated with an increased risk
of MI in later life. Waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio,
but not BMI and waist-to-height ratio, however, were more
strongly associated with the risk of MI in women than in men.
Moreover, measures of central adiposity, particularly waist-to-
hip ratio, were more strongly associated with the risk of MI
than BMI, especially among women. These findings were
consistent across age and socioeconomic groups.
General and central adiposity have been well established
as major modifiable risk factors for MI. However, studies have
reported conflicting findings on the comparative association
between different anthropometric measures and the risk of
MI, with conflicting results for women and men. Analyses from
the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration among 222 000
individuals showed that BMI, waist circumference, and waist-
to-hip ratio have similar strengths of association with
coronary heart disease, with no evidence for sex differences
in the relationships.11 Moreover, findings from the Physician’s
Health Study and the Women’s Health Study have indicated
that, although waist-to-height ratio was most strongly asso-
ciated with the risk of cardiovascular disease, differences with
BMI were small and were not considered as clinically
meaningful in either sex.12 In contrast, the INTERHEART
(Effect of Potentially Modifiable Risk Factors Associated with
Myocardial Infarction) case-control study including 12 500
cases of MI showed that, for both women and men, waist-to-
hip ratio was strongly associated with the risk of MI, whereas
the association of BMI with MI was considerably weaker and
less consistent.7 Results from a study among 12 European
cohorts and 2 Swedish studies each also suggested that

 measures of central obesity were more strongly associated
with cardiovascular mortality than BMI, with some indication
that the magnitude of the difference in the strength of the
association across measures was greater in women than
men.9,10 Furthermore, the EPIC-Norfolk (European Prospec-
tive Investigation of Cancer and Nutrition)
study among
24 000 individuals showed that waist-to-hip ratio was more
consistently associated with the risk of coronary heart
disease than waist circumference or BMI in both women
and men.8 The EPIC study including 360 000 individuals
demonstrated that higher waist circumference (both sexes)
and waist-to-hip ratio (women only) were associated with a
higher risk of coronary death, independent of BMI.6 The
findings from the present analyses complement and extend
these previous studies in several important ways. First, using
the same adiposity cut points in women and men in a single
model facilitated direct comparisons of the risk of MI
associated with adiposity measures in both sexes. Second,
in addition to exclusively reporting sex-specific effects,
estimation of the magnitude of any potential sex differences
revealed that waist-to-hip ratio and waist circumference,
respectively, were 15% and 7% more strongly associated with
the risk of MI in women than men. Third, direct quantitative
comparisons among several measures of adiposity demon-
strated that, for example, compared with BMI, waist-to-hip
ratio was an 18% stronger predictor of MI in women and a 6%
stronger predictor of MI in men. Waist-to-hip ratio may
therefore be a more comprehensive indicator of the risk of MI
associated with adiposity, especially in women but also in
men.
This study suggests that the sex dimorphism in the
quantity and distribution of adipose tissue not only results in
differences in body shape between women and men but may
also have differential implications for the future risk of MI.

 Body composition and fat distribution differ markedly between
women and men, with a predominance of fat mass and
subcutaneous fat in women and of lean mass and visceral fat
in men.13,14 These sex differences can, at least in part, be
attributed to the influence of sex hormones on fat distribution.
Although the major structural and functional differences
between subcutaneous and visceral fat are well characterized,
evidence for potential sex differences in the functionality of
each type of adipose tissue is more limited.13,14 However,
genome-wide
association
studies
of
markers
of
fat
distribution, but not of BMI, have identified several sexually
dimorphic variants, most of which conferred stronger effects
in women than men.19,20 The loci demonstrated to have a
stronger effect in women than men included several genes
known
to
be
associated
with
lipid
traits
and
insulin
resistance,20 providing some biological basis for women’s
greater excess risk of MI associated with waist circumference
and waist-to-hip ratio as seen in this study. Women develop
diabetes mellitus at a higher level of BMI and are at a greater
excess risk of stroke and coronary heart disease compared

 with men with diabetes mellitus.21–24 Differences in the waist-
to-hip ratio between individuals with and without diabetes
mellitus, however, are broadly similar between women and
men in the UK Biobank, providing further evidence that
markers of fat distribution may be a better indicator of
cardiometabolic risk among women than BMI.25
Our study has several strengths, including the prospective
design, large sample size, and direct measurement of general
and central adiposity on all participants. However, the UK
Biobank is a largely white population, and further analyses are
needed to determine the generalizability to other populations.
Imaging-derived measurements of body fat distribution and
body composition will become available in the UK Biobank in
due course26 and, combined with genetic data, will provide
unique and detailed insights into the sex-specific roles of
different aspects of adiposity and the risk of MI and several
other obesity-related conditions. Further disentangling the
sexual dimorphism in adiposity will yield insights into the
biological mechanisms and could inform sex-specific inter-
ventions to treat and halt the obesity epidemic worldwide.
In conclusion, although several measures of general and
central adiposity each have profound deleterious effects on
the risk of MI in both sexes, a higher waist-to-hip ratio and
waist circumference conferred a greater excess risk of MI in
women than men. Waist-to-hip ratio was more strongly
associated with the risk of MI than BMI in both sexes,
especially in women.
