Abstract
We previously described two donors in whom the extracellular domain of LAIR1, a collagen-
binding inhibitory receptor encoded on chromosome 191, was inserted between the V and the DJ 
segments of an antibody. This insertion generated, through somatic mutations, broadly reactive 
antibodies against RIFINs, a type of variant antigen expressed on the surface of Plasmodium 
falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IEs)2. To investigate how frequently such antibodies are 
produced in response to malaria infection, we screened plasma from two large cohorts of

 individuals living in malaria-endemic regions. We report that 5-10% of malaria-exposed 
individuals, but none of the European blood donors tested, have high levels of LAIR1-containing 
antibodies that dominate the response to IEs without conferring enhanced protection against 
febrile malaria. By analyzing the antibody-producing B cell clones at the protein, cDNA and 
gDNA level, we characterized additional LAIR1 insertions between the V and DJ segments and 
discovered a second insertion modality whereby the LAIR1 exon encoding the extracellular 
domain and flanking intronic sequences are inserted into the switch region. By exon shuffling, this 
mechanism leads to the production of bispecific antibodies in which the LAIR1 domain is 
precisely positioned at the elbow between the VH and CH1 domains. Additionally, in one donor 
the gDNA encoding the VH and CH1 domains was deleted, leading to the production of a camel-
like LAIR1-containing antibody. Sequencing of the switch regions of memory B cells from 
European blood donors revealed frequent templated inserts originating from transcribed genes 
that, in rare cases, comprised exons with orientation and frame compatible with expression. 
Collectively, these results reveal different modalities of LAIR1 insertion that lead to public and 
dominant antibodies against IEs and suggest that insertion of templated DNA represents an 
additional mechanism of antibody diversification that can be selected in the immune response 
against pathogens and exploited for B cell engineering.
LAIR1-containing antibodies were initially isolated from two Kenyan donors who were 
selected from a large cohort of more than 500 individuals for their capacity to produce 
broadly reactive antibodies to P. falciparum-IEs2. To establish the prevalence of LAIR1-
containing antibodies among malaria-exposed individuals, we screened plasma samples 
from two large cohorts in Tanzania3 and Mali4. To identify LAIR1-containing antibodies 
irrespective of their specificity for parasite isolates, we developed a two-determinant 
immunoassay using beads coated with anti-LAIR1 or a control antibody. Six out of 112 
Tanzanian donors (5.4%) and 57 out of 656 Malian donors (8.7%) had detectable levels of 
LAIR1-containing IgG (Fig. 1a). In addition, 2-4% of African donors had LAIR1-containing 
IgM, with no or variable levels of LAIR1-containing IgG (Fig. 1b, c). In contrast, only 3 and 
4 out of 1043 European blood donors showed a low positivity in the IgG and IgM LAIR1 
assay, respectively. The presence of LAIR1-containing antibodies was confirmed by the 
isolation of 52 immortalized B cell clones from seven East and West African donors 
(Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1), while we were not able to isolate 
LAIR1-containing monoclonal antibodies from four European donors that showed serum 
reactivity. The finding that 5-10% of individuals living in malaria-endemic regions produce 
LAIR1-containing antibodies is suggestive of a public antibody response.
To investigate the contribution of LAIR1-containing antibodies to the response to IEs, we 
dissected this response at the polyclonal and monoclonal level. Staining of IEs with plasma 
from selected individuals with LAIR1-containing antibodies revealed that the majority of 
IEs was recognized by the LAIR1 antibodies, while only a minority of IEs was recognized 
by conventional IgG (see examples in Fig. 1d). Furthermore, when the immortalized 
memory B cell clones from four donors were analyzed for reactivity to IEs and for the 
presence of LAIR1, all of the anti-IE monoclonal antibodies from three donors and most of 
the antibodies from the fourth donor contained the LAIR1 insert (Fig. 1e). These findings 
suggest that in certain individuals circulating antibody and memory B cell responses are

 dominated by LAIR1-containing antibodies, a finding that may be explained both by their 
breadth and by clonal expansion.
To investigate the nature of the LAIR1 insertion, we sequenced cDNA and gDNA from B 
cell clones isolated from different individuals. As previously reported for the first two 
Kenyan donors2, the B cell clones isolated from four Malian and Tanzanian donors (E, F, O 
and Q) contained an insertion of the LAIR1 exon with flanking intronic sequences between 
the V and DJ segments, positioning the LAIR1 domain in the CDR3 loop (Fig. 2a and 
Extended Data Fig. 1). The size of the insert and the partial splicing of the upstream intronic 
region differed between donors, but were identical in the sister clones isolated from each 
individual, indicating that in each donor the LAIR1-containing antibody response is 
monoclonal.
Strikingly, B cell clones from three additional donors showed a different insertion modality 
(Fig. 2b-d). The cDNA of clones isolated from donors M (Malian) and J (Tanzanian) 
contained only the LAIR1 exon, which was precisely located between the JH and CH1. In 
both cases, gDNA analysis revealed that a DNA fragment comprising the LAIR1 exon 
flanked by intronic sequences was inserted into the switch μ region (Extended Data Fig. 2) 
and, by alternative splicing, gave rise to two mRNA variants with or without the LAIR1 
insert. This was confirmed by the production of antibodies with or without LAIR1 in similar 
proportions by a single B cell clone (Fig. 2e). Another example of LAIR1 insertion into the 
switch region was observed in donor B (Kenyan), from whom we isolated a B cell clone 
(MGB47) producing a truncated LAIR1-containing IgG3 heavy chain without an attached 
light chain (Fig. 2f, g). In this clone, the gDNA carried multiple deletions that removed most 
of the VDJ and the entire CH1 region, leading to the production of a camel-like antibody5 
(Fig. 2d). Taken together, the above findings highlight a new modality of exon insertion in 
the switch region that can add an extra domain to an antibody.
The two insertion modalities result in the production of antibodies with non-conventional 
structures in which an additional domain is inserted in the CDR3 or in the elbow between 
the VH and CH1 (Fig. 3a). To investigate the effect of the insert position on antibody 
specificity, we designed different constructs in which unmutated LAIR1, mutated LAIR1 or 
other Ig-like domains were inserted into the CDR3 or into the elbow region of an antibody 
of known specificity that was used as a scaffold (Fig. 3b). Antibody constructs carrying 
LAIR1 stained IEs and were recognized by an anti-LAIR1 antibody, independent of the 
LAIR1 position in the scaffold. While insertion of LAIR1 into the CDR3 of an antibody 
specific for the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)6 abolished 
binding to GM-CSF, insertion of LAIR1, programmed cell death-1 (PD1), or signaling 
lymphocytic activation molecule family member (SLAM) Ig-like domains into the elbow 
region did not affect binding to GM-CSF. This indicates that the VH-CH1 elbow is 
permissive for insertions of different domains without affecting the original antibody 
specificity and may therefore be suitable for the generation of bispecific antibodies.
To analyze the role of somatic mutations we aligned and compared the LAIR1 sequences of 
52 antibodies (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Extended Data Table 1). LAIR1 inserts between the 
V and DJ segments carried several amino acid substitutions clustering at hot spots around

 positions 67, 77 and 102 that determined distinct patterns of reactivity with parasite isolates, 
as well as loss of collagen binding (Fig. 3c). In contrast, LAIR1 inserted into the switch 
region carried only a few substitutions, which were however sufficient to abolish collagen 
binding. In particular, the camel-like antibody MGB47, which had the highest level of amino 
acid substitutions among those with inserts in the switch region, showed a considerable 
breadth since it stained 8 out of the 9 parasites tested. Interestingly, we found that unmutated 
LAIR1 bound to a few isolates when tested at 1 μg ml-1 and to all parasites when tested at a 
100-fold higher concentration (Fig. 3c). We conclude that the unmutated LAIR1 domain 
binds with low affinity to most parasite isolates and that mutations can increase affinity and 
modify the spectrum of cross-reactivity. Furthermore, the finding that collagen binding is 
lost even in cases where the somatic mutation mechanism is less effective, as in the case of 
insertions into the switch region, suggests that there is strong pressure to “redeem” this BCR 
from autoreactivity7.
The insertion of an extra exon in the switch region represents a new modality of antibody 
diversification, analogous to exon shuffling8,9, that has the potential to generate a panoply 
of bispecific antibodies. To ask how generally and how frequently templated DNA 
sequences are inserted in the switch region, we isolated gDNA from switched memory B 
cells of European blood donors, amplified the switch regions and sequenced them using the 
Illumina platform (Extended Data Fig. 4). Using a bioinformatics pipeline, we identified 
templated inserts at a frequency of approximately one in >103 B cells, with the length of the 
inserts ranging from <100 to >1000 nucleotides (Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 5 and 
Supplementary Tables 2–4). Switch region inserts could also be detected using long-read 
MinION sequencing of intact amplicons, which provided a suitable platform for insert 
identification, in spite of its high error rate10. Using MinION, we confirmed the identity of 
several inserts using biological replicates and estimated a higher frequency of templated 
inserts in the range of one in a few hundred switched memory B cells (Fig. 4a and Extended 
Data Fig. 6). In contrast, no insert was detected in the switch region of naïve B cells (Fig 
4c). Interestingly, most of the inserts were derived from genic regions from all chromosomes 
and in particular from genes expressed in B cells, such as PAX5 and EBF1 (Fig. 4b,e,f and 
Extended Data Fig. 7). The genic inserts, which account for 75% of all inserts, were derived 
from introns, exons and, in some cases, comprised an entire exon with preserved splice sites 
(Fig. 4d). A fraction of the latter had the correct frame and orientation for the potential 
expression of an extra protein sequence in the Ig elbow (Extended Data Fig. 8). Taken 
together, the above findings indicate that templated inserts derived from transcribed genes 
are frequently found in the switch regions of memory B cells.
We have shown that LAIR1-containing antibodies are produced by two insertion modalities 
and have a prevalence of 5-10% of individuals exposed to malaria infection, suggesting that 
they may contribute to acquired immunity to blood-stage parasites. However, in spite of their 
breadth and opsonizing activity2, the presence of LAIR1-containing antibodies did not 
confer improved protection against febrile malaria (Extended Data Fig. 9), a finding that 
may be explained by the fact that the LAIR1-containing antibodies recognize only a fraction 
of cultured parasites and may allow the selection of escape mutants. A thorough 
investigation of the role of the LAIR1-containing antibodies in vivo will require the isolation 
of autologous parasites from the individuals who possess these antibodies.

 It is unusual that in all cases observed so far, the LAIR1-containing antibodies are produced 
by a single expanded B cell clone that dominates the antibody response to IEs in these 
individuals. The finding that unmutated LAIR1 has the inherent ability to bind to IEs 
explains how the insertion of this domain results in the generation of public antibodies with 
a common specificity. Furthermore, the fact that this domain binds to all parasite isolates 
tested, albeit with low affinity, suggests a mechanism for the extraordinary clonal expansion 
and selection of mutated antibody variants with improved affinity and breadth by repeated 
infections with different P. falciparum parasites. These findings illustrate, in a biologically 
relevant system, the power of clonal selection driven by both antigen binding and loss of 
self-reactivity. Furthermore, the binding of IEs to LAIR1 suggests the possibility that the 
parasite might target this inhibitory receptor to modulate the host immune response.
The LAIR1 insertion in the switch region resulting in the expression of a new domain in the 
elbow between the VH and CH1 domains represents a new and possibly general example of 
protein engineering by exon shuffling8,9, as suggested by the frequent occurrence of 
templated inserts. While insertions in the CDR3 loop result in monospecific antibodies, 
insertions in the switch region do not affect the specificity of the original antibody but rather 
add a second specificity which is found in approximately half of the antibodies produced due 
to alternative splicing. We are not aware of deliberate attempts to engineer the antibody 
elbow, and in this context, nature has shown considerable ingenuity by taking advantage of 
the exon shuffling principle.
It has been reported that in mice, chronic P. chabaudi infection promotes genomic instability 
leading to chromosomal translocations involving the switch region11. Although we cannot 
exclude that the LAIR1 insertions in the switch region observed in African donors may have 
been promoted by malaria infection, the frequent templated insertions found in European 
blood donors would be consistent with a general mechanism that does not necessarily rely 
on malaria infection. Nevertheless, the data suggest that it is the exposure to the malaria 
parasite that selects the rare B cells with a LAIR1 insertion in the VDJ or switch region. 
Finally, it remains to be established whether chromosomal translocations and templated 
insertions share a common mechanism.
The finding of templated inserts in the switch region of switched memory B cells, but not 
naïve B cells, suggests that the insertions occur in germinal centers as a consequence of 
unconventional repair of AID-induced double-strand DNA breaks. Similarly, repair of RAG-
induced double-strand breaks during B cell development in the bone marrow may give rise 
to insertions in the CDR3. Our finding that switch region inserts are derived from 
transcribed genes suggests an involvement of nascent RNA as an insert template and recent 
publications have shown that nascent RNA12,13 as well as foreign RNA14,15 can be used to 
repair double-strand DNA breaks. Furthermore, multiple templated inserts from transcribed 
genes have been observed in engineered double-strand breaks in a human cell line and 
mouse pro-B cells14,16. However, we cannot exclude accessible DNA as a primary 
substrate. The possibility of inducing human naïve B cells to switch in vitro offers an 
opportunity to study the mechanism of templated insertions and to engineer B cells by 
manipulating the factors involved in DNA repair and by offering different substrates.

 Materials and Methods
Serum and plasma samples
Kenyan plasma samples were obtained from adults living in a malaria-endemic region within 
Kilifi County. Tanzanian serum and plasma samples were obtained from healthy male 
volunteers, malaria negative at study enrolment and during PBMC collection, HIV and 
Hepatitis B and C negative, age 25.4 ± 2.8 (mean +/- SD)3. The Mali study was conducted 
in the rural village of Kalifabougou where intense P. falciparum transmission occurs from 
June through December each year. 610 individuals (310 males and 300 females) were 
enrolled, age ranging from 1 to 26 years (mean 9). The cohort has been described in detail 
elsewhere4. Smaller numbers of sera were also obtained from adults in the Fulani and 
Dogon ethnic groups in Mantéourou, Mali. 48 individuals (28 males and 20 females) were 
enrolled, age ranging from 21 to 57 years (mean 39.7).
Ethics approval
In all cases, written informed consent was obtained from the participants (or guardians of 
participating children) before inclusion in the study. The acquisition and use of the Kenyan 
plasma samples were approved by the Kenya Medical Research Institute Scientific and 
Ethics Review Unit (protocol number: KEMRI-SERU 3149), as well as the Oxford Tropical 
Research Ethics Committee. The Tanzanian samples were obtained with informed consent 
from the trial participants. The clinical trial was conducted according to Good Clinical 
Practices and with authorization from the Institutional Review Boards of the Ifakara Health 
Institute, the National Institute for Medical Research Tanzania, the Tanzanian Food and 
Drugs Authority and the Commission cantonale d'éthique de la recherche sur l'être humain 
du canton de Vaud, Switzerland. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: 
NCT01949909. The Mali study was approved by The Ethics Committee of the Faculty of 
Medicine, Pharmacy and Dentistry at the University of Sciences, Technique and Technology 
of Bamako, and the Institutional Review Board of the National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health. Written informed consent was obtained 
from participants or parents or guardians of participating children prior to inclusion in the 
Mali study.
Parasite culture
P. falciparum parasites were initially obtained from children who were diagnosed with 
malaria in Kilifi County, Kenya. The parasites were adapted to in vitro culture and cultivated 
using standard protocols17. The P. falciparum laboratory line 3D7 was also cultured under 
the same conditions. 3D7D21 is derived by enrichment of 3D7 parasites reactive with the 
LAIR1-containing monoclonal antibody MGD21. Parasites were cryopreserved at the late 
trophozoite stage in small aliquots for subsequent use in assays.
Screening of sera or plasma with bead-based immunoassay
Sera or plasma were tested for the presence of LAIR1-containing antibodies using a two-
determinant bead-based immunoassay. Anti-goat IgG microbeads (Spherotech) were coated 
with goat anti-human LAIR1 (R&D Systems, AF2664) and 40× SYBR Green I

 (ThermoFisher Scientific) or with goat anti-human EGF (R&D Systems, AF-259-NA) 
without SYBR Green I for 20 min at room temperature. The beads were washed, mixed, and 
incubated with the sera at a 1/30 dilution for 1 h at room temperature under shaking 
conditions. Beads coated with anti-LAIR1 were differentiated from control beads coated 
with anti-EGF based on SYBR Green staining. Serum antibody binding was detected using 
2.5 μg ml−1 Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated donkey anti-human IgG (Jackson 
ImmunoResearch, 709-606-098) or Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated donkey anti-human IgM 
(Jackson ImmunoResearch, 709-606-073). FACS Diva (version 6.2) was used for acquisition 
of samples and Flow-Jo (version 10.1) was used for FACS analysis. Delta MFI (median 
fluorescence intensity) was calculated by subtracting the MFI of the anti-EGF control beads 
from that of the anti-LAIR1 beads in the IgG or IgM channel.
B-cell immortalization and isolation of monoclonal antibodies
IgM or IgG memory B cells were isolated from frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs) by magnetic cell sorting with anti-CD19-PECy7 antibodies (BD, 341113) and 
mouse anti-PE microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-048-081), followed by FACS sorting using 
goat Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 109-606-170) 
or anti-human IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 109-606-129) and PE-labeled anti-human 
IgD (BD, 555779). As previously described18, sorted B cells were immortalized with 
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and plated in single cell cultures in the presence of CpG-DNA 
(2.5 µg ml−1) and irradiated PBMC-feeder cells. Two weeks post-immortalization, the 
culture supernatants were tested (at a 2/3 dilution) for the presence of LAIR1-containing 
antibodies using the bead-based immunoassay described above. For several donors, the 
culture supernatants were also tested for the ability to bind to IEs from a mixture of four 
parasite isolates (3D7-MGD21+, 9106, 9605 and 11019) by flow cytometry. Briefly, 
cryopreserved IEs were thawed, stained with 10× SYBR Green I for 30 min at room 
temperature, and incubated with the B-cell supernatants for 1 hour at 4°C. Detection of 
antibody binding was done with 2.5 μg ml−1 Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-human 
IgG.
Sequence analysis of antibody cDNA
cDNA was synthesized from selected B-cell cultures and both heavy chain and light chain 
variable regions (VH and VL) were sequenced as previously described19. The usage of VH 
and VL genes and the number of somatic mutations were determined by analyzing the 
homology of VH and VL sequences of monoclonal antibodies to known human V, D and J 
genes in the IMGT database20. Antibody-encoding sequences were amplified and 
sequenced with primers specific for the V and J regions of the given antibody. Sequences 
were aligned with Clustal Omega21.
Mutation analysis of LAIR1 inserts
The number of somatic mutations in the LAIR1 inserts was obtained by analyzing the 
homology of the inserts to the original LAIR1 genomic sequence (sequence from Ensembl 
genome database: ENSG00000167613). Amino acid sequences of LAIR1 inserts of all the 
antibodies discovered were grouped for each donor and aligned to the original unmutated 
LAIR1 sequence using Clustal Omega21. The replacement to silent mutation ratio (R/S)

 values were calculated at each codon for each donor. Mean (R/S) values above 2.9, 
indicative of positive selection, were used to highlight hot spots in the LAIR1 extracellular 
domain (PDB 3RP1) using the BioLuminate software (Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, 
2016 v2.4).
Production of recombinant antibodies, antibody variants and fusion proteins
Antibody heavy and light chains were cloned into human IgG1, Igκ and Igλ expression 
vectors and expressed by transient transfection of Expi293F Cells (ThermoFisher Scientific) 
using polyethylenimine (PEI). Cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma 
contamination. The antibodies were affinity purified by protein A chromatography (GE 
Healthcare). Variants of the GCE536, MGD21, MGM1 and MGJ5 antibodies were produced 
by inserting or exchanging the mutated or unmutated LAIR1 sequences or by substituting 
these sequences with the Ig-like domains of PD1 and SLAM genes (sequences from 
Ensembl genome database: ENSG00000188389 and ENSG00000117090, respectively). The 
antibody constructs were tested for staining of 9215 IEs and binding values (%) at 1 μg ml−1 
antibody concentration were calculated by interpolation of binding curves fitted to a 
sigmoidal curve model (Graphpad Prism 7).
Amplification of antibody gDNA
Genomic DNA was isolated from B-cell clones with a commercial kit (QIAGEN). For 
analysis of the camel-like antibody MGB47, 3’RACE22 with the CH2-γ-REV1 primer 
(gagaccttgcacttgtactccttgcc) was used for amplification of truncated heavy chain mRNAs. 
Heavy-chain variable to constant gDNA of MGB47 was amplified using an upstream 5’ 
VH3-21 primer (gggtccatattgtgatcctgagtctggg) and CH2-γ-REV1 as the reverse primer. 
After PCR amplification with LongAmp Taq Polymerase (New England Biolabs), the 
6000bp amplicon was cloned into a vector using the TOPO XL PCR cloning kit 
(ThermoFisher) and sequenced by plasmid-NGS-sequencing (Microsynth, Switzerland). All 
other LAIR1 switch and V-DJ inserts were analyzed by PCR amplification of gDNA and 
Sanger Sequencing using donor-specific forward and universal reverse primers: donE_FW 
(cctggagggtcttctgcttgctggc), donF_FW (cctcctgctggtggcagctccc), donJ/M_FW1 
(atggagtttgggctgagctgggttttcc), donJ_FW2 (gtgagtgaacacgagtgagagaaacagtgg), donM_FW2 
(gagtgaacatgagtgagaaaaactggatttgtgtgg), donO/Q_FW (atgaaacatctgtggttctt), 3’J6_REV 
(ggcatcggaaaatccacagaggctcc), IgG_CH1_REV1 (tcttgtccaccttggtgttgct), IgG_CH1_REV2 
(gtagtccttgaccaggcagc), IgM_CH2_REV1 (ggacacctgaatctgccggggactgaaaccc), and 
IgM_CH2_REV2 (ctggtcaccttgtaggtcgtgggcccag).
Switch region PCR and Illumina sequencing
Genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from FACS-sorted human naïve (CD19+ CD27- IgM+) 
or memory B cells (CD19+ CD27+ IgG+/IgA+) using a commercial kit (QIAGEN). Switch 
region PCRs on memory B cell gDNA were performed using LongAmp Taq Polymerase 
(New England Biolabs) in 50 µl reaction volumes with incubation for 3 min at 95°C, 
followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 40 s, 60°C for 30 s, 65°C for 3 min and a final extension 
for 10 min at 65°C. The upstream switch-µ forward primer S-µ-FW 
(cacccttgaaagtagcccatgccttcc) was combined with different reverse primers. IgG-switched B 
cell DNA was amplified using S-γ-REV (cctgcctcccagtgtcctgcattacttctg)23 , which binds 3’

 of switch-γ-regions, or CH2-γ-REV1, which binds in the IgG-CH2 constant region, to allow 
amplification of alleles carrying a CH1 deletion. DNA deriving from IgA+ sorted cells was 
amplified with primer S-α-REV (ctcagtccaacacccaccactcc). All reverse primers mentioned 
were designed to allow amplification of various IgG and IgA subclasses. The switch-µ 
region of naïve B cell gDNA was amplified combining the S-µ-FW primer with S-µ-REV 
(ggaacgcagtgtagactcagctgagg). The PCR reaction was performed using Herculase II Fusion 
DNA Polymerases (Agilent) with 1 M betaine and 3% DMSO in a 50 µl volume at 98°C for 
4 min followed by 30 cycles of 98°C for 40 s, 58°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 4 min, with a 
final extension for 10 min at 72°C. Size-selected, purified switch amplicons were sent to 
GATC Biotech (Germany) for library preparation, barcoding, and Illumina MiSeq 
sequencing.
MinION sequencing
Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) was used to generate biological and technical 
replicates of Illumina MiSeq sequencing runs. For biological replicates, barcodes (BC) were 
introduced by the addition of recommended BC-sequences to S-µ and S-γ primers and PCR 
amplification. The sequencing library was prepared using the Nanopore 2D sequencing kit 
SQK-LSK207, followed by loading onto Nanopore flow cells FLO-MIN106 and sequencing 
with the MinION Mk1B sequencer for up to 20 h.
IE binding assays
Recombinant monoclonal antibodies were produced in 293 Expi cells and tested for the 
ability to stain 3D7-MGD21+ and eight Kenyan parasite isolates2 by flow cytometry. 
Cryopreserved IEs were thawed, stained with 10× SYBR Green I for 30 min at room 
temperature, and incubated with serial dilutions of the recombinant antibodies for 20 min at 
room temperature. Antibody binding was detected with 2.5 μg ml−1 goat Alexa Fluor 647-
conjugated anti-human IgG.
Selected sera were screened for the presence of LAIR1-containing antibodies that could bind 
to IEs. A mixture of four parasite isolates (3D7-MGD21+, 9106, 9605 and 11019) was 
stained with 10 μg ml−1 DAPI for 30 min at room temperature and incubated with test sera 
at a 1/30 dilution for 20 min at room temperature. The IEs were then incubated with goat 
anti-human LAIR1 (R&D Systems, AF2664) for 20 min at room temperature. The binding 
of LAIR1-containing antibodies to the IE surface was detected by the simultaneous addition 
of Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 
705-546-147) and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated donkey anti-human IgG (Jackson 
ImmunoResearch, 709-606-098).
ELISA
Total IgGs were quantified using 96-well MaxiSorp plates (Nunc) coated with goat anti-
human IgG (SouthernBiotech, 2040-01) using Certified Reference Material 470 (ERMs-
DA470, Sigma-Aldrich) as a standard. To test specific binding of antibody constructs, 
ELISA plates were coated with 2 μg ml−1 of type I recombinant human collagen (Millipore, 
CC050), 2 μg ml−1 of an anti-human LAIR1 antibody (clone DX26, BD Biosciences 
550810), 1 μg ml−1 of recombinant human GM-CSF (Gentaur), 2 μg ml−1 of an anti-PD1 or

 an anti-SLAM antibody (R&D Systems, AF1086 and AF164). Plates were blocked with 1% 
bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated with titrated antibodies, followed by AP-
conjugated goat anti-human IgG, Fcγ fragment specific (Jackson Immuno Research, 
109-056-098). Plates were then washed, substrate (p-NPP, Sigma) was added and plates 
were read at 405 nm.
Western blots
B cell supernatants containing secreted antibodies were diluted in H2O, 4x sample loading 
buffer (Life Technologies) and 10x sample reducing agent (Life Technologies) and loaded 
onto precast gels with a 4-12% acrylamide gradient (Invitrogen). The iBlot2 apparatus (Life 
Technologies) was used for protein transfer to PVDF membranes followed by blocking for 1 
h at room temperature with 3% BSA in TBS. The membrane was incubated with different 
combinations of primary and secondary antibodies diluted in TBS/1% BSA for 1 h at room 
temperature with 2 sequential TBS incubations to wash the membrane between incubations. 
For detection of IgG, anti-human IgG-biotinylated antibody (Southern Biotech, 2040-08) 
was used at 1 µg ml-1, followed by 25 ng ml-1 streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) 
(Jackson ImmunoResearch, 016-030-084). IgM isotypes were stained with 10 µg ml-1 
unlabeled goat anti-human IgM (Southern Biotech, 2020-01) and 8 ng ml-1 donkey anti-goat 
HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 705-036-147). To detect LAIR1-containing antibodies, a 
polyclonal goat anti-human LAIR1 antibody (R&D) at 2 µg ml-1 was combined with 
secondary donkey anti-goat HRP. Membranes were developed with ECL-substrate on a 
Las4000 imager (General Electric Company).
Surface staining of B cell lines
EBV immortalized B cells were stained with different fluorescently labeled antibodies to 
detect surface immunoglobulin expression and LAIR1 co-staining (Alexa Fluor 647-
conjugated anti-human IgG, Jackson ImmunoResearch, 109-606-170; FITC-conjugated anti-
human kappa, DAKO, F0434, PE-conjugated anti-human lambda, DAKO, R0437; PE-
conjugated anti-human LAIR1 clone DX26, BD Bioscience, 550811). Cells were analyzed 
by flow cytometry and FlowJo software. Dead cells were excluded from the analysis by 4',6-
Diamidine-2'-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) staining. The time point of the analysis 
was selected for optimal BCR expression levels and for downregulation of the original 
LAIR1 receptor, because EBV cell lines downregulate the inhibitory receptor LAIR1 at an 
early time point after immortalization but may also decrease surface-Ig levels after certain 
passages.
Genomic insertion analysis after Illumina sequencing
We generated a computational pipeline to analyze targeted amplicons of 300 bp paired-end 
(PE) reads obtained by MiSeq Illumina sequencing methodology (Extended Data Fig. 5). 
Raw sequences reads were trimmed to remove adapter contamination and poor-quality base 
calls using Trim Galore (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/, 
v0.4.2, parameters --Illumina --paired -q 20 --length 99). In addition, assessment of the PE 
reads was performed by average quality score per base position, using FastQC (http://
www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Trimmed reads were aligned in 
paired-end mode to the GRCh37 human genome assembly using Burrows-Wheeler

 Alignment tool (v0.7.12, parameters: bwa mem)24 . The switch region of the IgH locus was 
defined on GRCh37, with the following coordinates: chr14:106050000-106337000. To find 
insertions in the IgH switch region locus, we selected genomic ranges when sequence 
coverage was above 2 reads and/or above 40 reads, thus, generating two respective and 
separated workflows, with a sequence length comprises between 50 bp and 2000 bp. 
Genome coverage was processed by Bedtools (http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
index.html, v2.26.0) and a dedicated python script using pysam (https://github.com/pysam-
developers/pysam) was written to identify potential insert. Briefly, in both workflows (2 and 
40 reads), potential inserts were assigned if they fulfilled the following criteria: (i) one 
mapping read in 5’ end is chimeric with the switch region (ii) one mapping read in 3’ end is 
chimeric with the switch region (iii) two discordant reads have their mates read mapped in 
the switch region. Afterwards, inserts coming from 2 and 40 minimum reads coverage were 
merged according to the following rule: if the difference between two inserts that overlap 
was equal or below 10 bp, we kept the shortest one, otherwise the longest one is kept. The 
list of potential inserts was annotated using GENCODE v1925 and BEDOPS tools26 and 
individually validated by a de novo assembly of the contig sequence. Non-chimeric, but 
properly paired reads mapping the insert coordinates and chimeric reads corresponding to 
the encompassing mate pairs and spanning mate pairs, were extracted using SAMtools27. 
Reads mapping to the switch region were extracted only if they were spanning mate pairs 
related to the insert coordinates. Selected reads were uniquely mapped to the region of 
interest (no XA tag), with a minimum mapping quality of 5. Original reads sequences were 
retrieved, pull together and used as input files to perform a de novo assembly using the 
Trinity software28. Finally, to validate a contig sequence for each insert, we used BLAST29 
(command-line version, v2.5.0+). The consensus insert sequences were “blasted” against the 
switch region and we removed the inserts that had an alignment with at least half of their 
sequence length at a minimum 80 % identity (parameters: -task megablast -dust no -
perc_identity 80). Then, we blasted each contig sequence against the switch region sequence 
and the consensus insert sequence (parameters: -task blastn -dust no -perc_identity 70) to 
confirm if the contig was made of the complete insert sequence and if the contig contained 
two flanking sequences of at least 50bp that matched the switch region. The shortest contig 
that fulfilled the criteria mentioned above was selected for each insert.
Bioinformatic analysis of MinION sequencing
To analyze targeted amplicon 2-4 kb reads obtained by ONT sequencing methodology, we 
developed a pipeline (Extended Data Fig. 6). Raw sequences reads were quality-filtered 
using Metrichor basecaller (https://metrichor.com/s/). 2D reads with a sequence length above 
1000bp (or 2000bp depending on the primers used for the amplification) were aligned 
against GRCh37 human genome assembly with LAST software30 (parameters: last-train 
and lastal -p ONT_fasta_sequences.par last-split -m1e-6). Then we parsed LAST output and 
selected reads that contain an insert (minimum 50 bp length), two flanking regions of 
minimum 100 bp mapping to the switch region (switch locus defined as 
chr14:106050000-106337000) and allowing a gap of 100 bp maximum between the insert 
and the switch region. Finally, we merged the insert coordinates of the overlapping inserts 
with bedtools and annotated the inserts list with GENCODE v1925 using BEDOPS tool26. 
Scripts are available at MinION and Illumina inserts coordinates were merged with Bedtools

 (merge command with default parameter). The circular genomic representation of the inserts 
has been generated using the Circos software31. Switch inserts with genic (intron or exon-
intron) origin were subjected to an enrichment analysis using EnrichR and the Human Gene 
Atlas as the gene-set library32,33.
Statistical analysis
The number n described in the figure legends refers to the number of independent 
experiments. The analysis of the relationship between the presence of LAIR1-containing 
antibodies and protection from malaria was performed in the R statistical environment 
(v3.2.5). Two-tailed Fisher’s exact tests were performed to investigate the association 
between LAIR1-containing antibodies and protection from febrile malaria.

regions.
a, b, Prevalence of LAIR1-containing IgG and IgM in African individuals living in malaria-
endemic regions and in European blood donors. Donors from whom LAIR1-containing 
antibodies were isolated are named and highlighted in red. c, Comparison between LAIR1-
containing IgG and IgM values. MFI, median fluorescence intensity. Data points with a delta 
MFI value below -2000 are not shown. d, Staining of IEs by LAIR1-containing IgG and 
conventional IgG from three representative donors. e, Dominance of LAIR1-containing B 
cell clones among memory B cells specific for IEs. Monoclonal antibodies isolated from 
immortalized memory B cells were classified based on their ability to bind to IEs and the 
presence of a LAIR1 insert. Bars show number of IgG or IgM monoclonal antibodies 
isolated from each donor. For gating strategy, see Supplementary Figure 1. nd = not 
determined.

a, Schematic representation of LAIR1-containing antibodies produced by different insertion 
modalities. b, Scheme of the constructs (C1-C10) containing LAIR1 or other Ig-like 
domains in different positions which were tested for binding to a set of antigens or anti-
domain antibodies by ELISA or FACS. The construct domains and their binding values to 
the cognate ligands are color coded as depicted in the figure. The V and J segments that do 
not contribute to any binding are not colored. BKC3, in grey, is a negative control. 
LAIR1D21, LAIR1M1 and LAIR1J5 are the exons from MGD21, MGM1 and MGJ5 
antibodies. LAIR1gen is the unmutated genomic sequence of LAIR1 encoded on 
chromosome 19. MGDUCA = unmutated common ancestor of donor D antibodies; GL = 
germline. Data are from one experiment out of two. c, Binding of LAIR1-containing 
antibodies to erythrocytes infected with nine parasite isolates and to human collagen (n=1). 
Values refer to binding at a concentration of 1 μg ml-1. The MGDUCA was also tested at 100 
μg ml-1. The number of amino acid substitutions is reported in brackets next to the antibody 
names.

 Figure 4. Frequent occurrence of templated inserts in the switch region.
a, Inserts in the switch region were detected by amplification and Illumina MiSeq 
sequencing (left) of 6 polyclonal samples of primary B cells from European donors and of 
the MGB47 monoclonal cell line as a control. Biological replicates were analyzed with 
MinION technology (right). Shown are the size distribution of all detected inserts and the 
estimated number of B cells that need to be analysed to detect one insert. For each 
technology, two independent experiments with 2-3 donors were performed. Red lines show 
mean values. b, Circos plot showing the origin of the inserts from different chromosomes. c, 
Insert frequencies in switch-µ regions of naïve B cells and in µ-γ joint regions of IgG 
memory B cells. d, Frequency of intergenic and different types of genic inserts. The red bar 
shows the number of exon-containing inserts with preserved splice sites in anti-sense and 
sense orientation. Inserts with the correct orientation and frame of the coding sequence 
(CDS) are highlighted in pink. e, EnrichR analysis on the Human Gene Atlas reveals 
significant enrichment for B cell genes. f, List of B cell-specific genes donating inserts.
