ABSTRACT
Background: Cashews are the third most-consumed tree nut in the
United States and are abundant with monounsaturated fatty acids
and polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are associated with reduced
cardiovascular disease risk. Although a qualified Food and Drug
Administration health claim exists for nuts and heart health,
cashews have been exempt from its use because cashews exceed
the disqualifying amount of saturated fatty acids. Approximately
one-third of the saturated fat in cashews is stearic acid, which is
relatively neutral on blood lipids, thereby suggesting that cashews
could have effects that are similar to those of other nuts. However,
clinical data on cashews and blood lipids have been limited.
Objective: We investigated the effect of reasonable intakes of
cashews on serum lipids in adults with or at risk of high LDL
cholesterol.
Design: In a randomized, crossover, isocaloric, controlled-feeding
study, 51 men and women (aged 21–73 y) with a median LDL-
cholesterol concentration of 159 mg/dL (95% CI: 146, 165 mg/dL)
at screening consumed typical American diets with cashews (28–
64 g/d; 50% of kilocalories from carbohydrate, 18% of kilocalories
from protein, and 32% of kilocalories from total fat) or potato chips
(control; 54% of kilocalories from carbohydrate, 18% of kilocalo-
ries from protein, and 29% of kilocalories from total fat) for 28 d
with a $2-wk washout period.
Results: Consumption of the cashew diet resulted in a significantly
greater median change from baseline (compared with the control,
all P , 0.05) in total cholesterol [23.9% (95% CI: 29.3%, 1.7%)
compared with 0.8% (95% CI: 21.5%, 4.5%), respectively], LDL
cholesterol [24.8% (95% CI: 212.6%, 3.1%) compared with 1.2%
(95% CI: 22.3%, 7.8%), respectively], non-HDL cholesterol [25.3%
(95% CI: 28.6%, 2.1%) compared with 1.7% (95% CI: 20.9%,
5.6%), respectively], and the total-cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol ratio
[20.0% (95% CI: 24.3%, 4.8%) compared with 3.4% (95% CI:
0.6%, 5.2%), respectively]. There were no significant differences be-
tween diets for HDL cholesterol and triglyceride.
Conclusions: In comparison with a control diet, the incorporation
of cashews into typical American diets decreases total cholesterol
and LDL cholesterol. Results from this study provide support that
the daily consumption of cashews, when substituted for a high-
carbohydrate snack, may be a simple dietary strategy to help man-
age total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. This study was registered
at
clinicaltrials.gov
as
NCT02769741.

INTRODUCTION
Elevated LDL cholesterol is a major independent risk factor
for cardiovascular disease (CVD)5 (1), and diet and lifestyle
measures are the primary approach for healthy individuals to
maintain optimum LDL-cholesterol concentrations. Nuts are one
dietary component that has been identified as being beneficial
for heart health through the management of blood lipids. Indeed,
the 2010 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) re-
viewed the evidence on the health effects of nuts (2) and showed
that general nut consumption had a favorable impact on CVD
risk factors, particularly on serum lipid concentrations. Thus, the
2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans incorporated nuts into
its policy recommendations for foods to increase as part of a
healthy eating pattern. Similarly, the 2015 DGAC noted that
nuts are associated with reduced CVD risk (3), and the recent
2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans continued to recom-
mend the consumption of nuts as part of a healthy diet (4). In
addition, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) qualified
health claim also exists for nuts (5). However, the FDA excluded
cashews from the claim because of 1) the lack of specific re-
search data regarding a lipid-lowering effect of cashews, and 2)
the SFA content of cashews exceeded the disqualifying amount
(4 g/50 g serving of nuts).
Cashews (Anacardium occidentale tree nut) are the fourth
most-produced tree nut globally behind almonds, walnuts, and
pistachios (6). In the United States, cashews are the third most-
consumed tree nut per capita at 0.42 kg/y behind almonds

 (0.84 kg/y) and walnuts (0.47 kg/y) (6). Nutritionally, 1
serving of cashews (28 g) contributes 4.3 g protein and also
provides appreciable amounts of magnesium and potassium
[74 mg Mg (19% of the daily value) and 160 mg K (5% of the
daily value)] (7). Of the fat in cashews (w73% of total kilo-
calories), 60% is from MUFAs, and w18–20% is from PUFAs
(7). Although cashews provide .4 g SFA/50-g serving, one-
third of this total is from stearic acid (18:0), which is consid-
ered cholesterol neutral when used to replace carbohydrate or
beneficial when replacing cholesterol-raising SFAs (e.g., 12:0–
16:0) (8).
When the FDA health claim for nuts was reviewed and pub-
lished, little research had been done to assess whether all SFAs
would increase plasma lipid concentrations equally. Now, it is
generally accepted that stearic acid should not be included with
other SFAs when considering the effect of fatty acids on plasma
lipids (9, 10). Moreover, because the majority of the fat in cashews
is MUFAs and PUFAs, it is predicted that cashews would have a
favorable effect on LDL cholesterol.
To our knowledge, the only published study that investigated
the effects of cashews on blood lipids in adults was in metabolic
syndrome and normal cholesterol concentrations (11). The intent
of the current study was to address this research gap by exploring
the effect of cashews at reasonable intakes in adults with high or
at risk of high LDL cholesterol. We hypothesized that, compared
with an isocaloric control, the consumption of cashews for 4 wk
would lower LDL cholesterol in a consistent magnitude and
direction that have been shown for other nuts included in the
FDA-authorized qualified health claim.
METHODS
Study design
The study was conducted at Biofortis Inc. (Addison, IL) be-
tween January 2016 and June 2016. The study protocol and
relevant documents were approved by an institutional review
board (IntegReview) before initiation of the trial, and subjects
provided written informed consent and authorization for the
disclosure of protected health information before enrolling in the
study. The study was conducted according to Good Clinical
Practice Guidelines, the Declaration of Helsinki (2006), and the
United States 21 Code of Federal Regulations and was registered
at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02769741.
The study was conducted as a randomized, crossover, isocaloric,
controlled-feeding study, with two 28-d intervention periods and a
2-wk washout period between interventions. During each in-
tervention period, subjects were provided with roasted, salted
cashews (w11% of total kilocalories; 28–64 g/d), or baked potato
chips (Lays Baked Chips; PepsiCo) (w11% of total kilocalories;
32–64 g/d) within a weight-maintenance dietary program. The
nutrient composition of the study products are shown in Table 1.
Subjects reported to the clinic every day on Monday through
Friday during both intervention periods, at which times they were
served breakfast (between 0630 and 0930) and received lunch,
dinner, and snacks, including 1 serving of the study product, for
consumption away from the clinic on that day. Meals for Satur-
days and Sundays were dispensed on Fridays for consumption
outside the clinic. A statistician generated a randomization list for
the intervention sequence with the use of the SAS PROC PLAN
with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Numbered, opaque, and sealed enve-
lopes that concealed the allocation sequence were opened se-
quentially by a staff member only after a subject was confirmed to
be eligible for the study, and the randomization number and test
sequence were recorded with the subject’s source documentation.
Controlled diet
A range of menu plans in 300-kcal increments from 1800 to
3300 kcal/d was created. Diets were designed to reflect typical
intakes of US adults and provided w49% of total kilocalories per
day from carbohydrate (15–20 g total fiber intake/d), w16% of
total kilocalories per day from protein, and w33% of total ki-
localories per day from fat (w11% SFAs) (12). Daily energy
and nutrient intakes for the rotating menus were calculated with
the use of a combination of nutrition facts of packaged foods
and Food Processor SQL Nutrition Analysis and Fitness Soft-
ware (version 10.4.0; ESHA Research) (Table 2).
Randomly collected menu samples (n = 12) that covered all 6
energy intake concentrations for both diets were analyzed for
their nutrient compositions (M´
erieux NutriSciences Corp.) with
the use of FDA-accepted analyses for nutrient labeling. Planned
and analyzed compositions of the diets that were adjusted to
represent amounts for a 2000-kcal/d diet are shown in Table 2.
Nutrient compositions of the diets were modeled on the basis of
published studies that investigated the effects of nuts on blood
lipids (11, 13). As planned for and confirmed by the analysis, the
contribution of fat to total energy was greater in the cashew diet
than in the control diet. The incorporation of cashews into the
controlled diet resulted in greater MUFA intake than with the
control diet and without any differences in SFAs and PUFAs. To
account for the greater caloric contribution of fat from cashews, a
greater amount of carbohydrate was provided during the control
diet than during the cashew diet that did not affect the dietary
fiber. There were no differences in the amount of protein provided
during the 2 interventions. The fatty acid compositions of each
diet, which were obtained from a nutrient composition analysis,
are shown in Supplemental Table 1.
Meal plans were assigned to subjects on the basis of energy
needs that were calculated with the use of the Mifflin-St. Jeor
equation (14), which provided an estimate of the resting energy
expenditure and the mean estimated energy that was expended
doing physical activity as assessed with the use of the Stanford

 7-d activity questionnaire (15). Subjects were instructed to
consume all study foods in their entirety and to avoid consuming
any additional food or nonspecified beverage items. In the event
that a subject consumed a nonstudy food or caloric beverage, he
or she was instructed to record intake of the food or beverage item
in a provided notebook and to return the uneaten portion of the
nonstudy food or the label of the nonstudy item to the clinic.
Compliance with study-product consumption was documented
by the percentage of scheduled study-product intakes over each
28-d intervention. Compliance with the overall diet was evaluated
by the study staff according to the returned food items from the
lunch and dinner meals as well as from snacks. Body weight was
assessed during each visit throughout the intervention period, and
meal plans were adjusted, as needed, to ensure each subject
maintained a stable body weight. Subjects were also instructed to
maintain their usual physical activity levels and other habits
throughout the trial, and queries regarding compliance with these
instructions were made at each visit.
Subjects
Eligible subjects were normally active men and women
(nonpregnant and nonlactating) aged 21–79 y, inclusive, with
BMI (in kg/m2) $18.0 and ,32.0, fasting LDL-cholesterol
concentrations
$130
and ,200
mg/dL, and fasting
tri-
glyceride concentrations #350 mg/dL. A medical history and
standard chemistry and hematology profile were obtained at
screening to rule out the presence of conditions that may have
affected the outcome of the study including CVD, diabetes
mellitus, and uncontrolled hypertension. Subjects were also
excluded if they had a .20% risk of developing a coronary heart
disease event within 10 y as assessed with the use of the Fra-
mingham Risk Score. In addition, subjects were also required to
have a calculated energy need of $1800 and #3300 kcal/d.
Demographics and selected baseline characteristics of subjects
who were randomly assigned to the study are shown in Table 3.
Individuals who reported the use of medications that were
intended to alter the lipid profile or of weight-loss drugs or pro-
grams within 4 wk of their screening visits were not included.
Individuals who reported the use of dietary supplements that might
alter lipid metabolism within 2 wk of screening were also not
included. If a subject had an active infection or used antibiotics
within 5 d of any of the scheduled lipid blood draws, the visit was
rescheduled and, when applicable, was extended until $ 5 d after
the infection resolved or antibiotic use had been completed.
Laboratory measurements
All blood samples were collected after an overnight (12 6 2 h)
fast. Baseline blood samples were collected at day 0 of each in-
tervention, and postintervention samples were collected on 2
separate days at the end of each 28-d consumption period. Serum
chemistry and hematology profiles were measured at screening.
After separation by centrifugation, plasma was aliquoted and
stored immediately at 2808C until it was analyzed. Except for
plasma fatty acids, all laboratory measurements were conducted
by the Elmhurst Hospital Reference Laboratory. The LDL-
cholesterol concentration (milligram per deciliter) was calculated
according to the Friedewald equation (16): LDL cholesterol =
total cholesterol 2 HDL cholesterol 2 (triglyceride/5), only if

 the triglyceride concentration was ,400 mg/dL. Non-HDL cho-
lesterol was calculated as total cholesterol – HDL cholesterol.
Plasma fasting concentrations of total fatty acids were
assessed at baseline and the end of each 28-d intervention period
and were analyzed with the use of gas chromatography (GC)
with flame ionization detection by OmegaQuant LLC. Briefly,
plasma was transferred to a screw-cap glass vial that contained
1,2-diheptadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine as in inter-
nal standard (di-17:0 phospholipid) (Avanti Polar Lipids) and the
methylation reagent (methanol containing 14% boron trifluoride,
toluene, methanol; 35:30:35 volume:volume:volume; Sigma-
Aldrich) was added. The vial was briefly vortexed and heated
in a hot bath at 1008C for 45 min. After cooling, hexane (EMD
Chemicals) and HPLC-grade water were added and the tubes
were recapped, vortexed, and centrifuged to separate layers. An
aliquot of the hexane layer was transferred to a GC vial. GC was
carried out with the use of a GC-2010 Gas Chromatograph
(Shimadzu Corp.) that was equipped with an SP-2560, 100-m
fused silica capillary column (0.25-mm internal diameter,
0.2-mm film thickness; Supelco). Fatty acids were identified by
comparison with a standard mixture of fatty acids (GLC OQ-A;
Nu-Check Prep), which was also used to determine individual
fatty acid calibration curves. The di-17:0 phospholipid was used
to calculate the recovery efficiency of the assay and was applied
to all fatty acids. The fatty acid composition was expressed as a
percentage of total identified fatty acids.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted with the use of SAS for
Windows software (version 9.1.3; SAS Institute Inc.). A sample
of 42 subjects was expected to provide 80% power (a = 0.05;
2 tailed) to detect a difference between treatments of 4% in the
change in LDL cholesterol (the primary outcome variable) from
baseline to the end of the intervention period with the assump-
tion of a 9% pooled SD. A sample of 51 subjects was randomly
assigned to allow for attrition and noncompliance.
The primary analysis was completed for the intent-to-treat
sample, which included all subjects who were randomly assigned
into the study. In addition, analyses were conducted on subjects who
completed both intervention periods and were compliant with the
overall diet [per protocol (PP)]. All analyses of study samples were
identified before locking the database. The statisticians who per-
formed the analysis and the scientific investigators remained blinded
to the intervention sequence until after the completion of all sta-
tistical analyses.
Unless otherwise stated, tests of significance were 2 sided and
were performed at a 5% level of significance. The baseline
comparability of intervention-sequence groups for lipid and
blood pressure variables was assessed with the use of paired t test
or Wilcoxon’s signed rank test. A chi-square test or Fisher’s
exact test was used, as appropriate, for the demographic vari-
ables. The primary outcome variable was the percentage of
change from baseline (day 0) to the end of each intervention
period (mean of values on days 25 and 28) in the LDL-cholesterol
concentration. Other outcome variables included the percentage
of changes from baseline in total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol,
non-HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride; the total-cholesterol:HDL-
cholesterol ratio; and the change in plasma fatty acids. Outcome
variables were assessed with the use of repeated-measures
ANCOVA via the SAS Proc Mixed procedure (SAS Institute
Inc.). Initial repeated-measures ANCOVA models contained
terms for the intervention, intervention sequence, and test pe-
riod, in which the intervention was specified as a repeated
effect with the subject nested within the sequence and the
baseline value included as a covariate. Models were reduced with

 the use of a backward-selection method until only significant
terms or the intervention remained. Adjustments for multi-
ple comparisons were not performed on secondary outcome
variables.
An assumption of normality of residuals was investigated for
each response measurement. If the normality assumption was
rejected at the 5% level of significance with the use of a
Shapiro-Wilk test, an analysis, on the basis of rank-transformed
data, was performed. Finally, missing data were not imputed;
thus, only observed data were analyzed. Data are presented as
means 6 SEMs or medians (95% CIs).
RESULTS
Subjects
Of 96 subjects who were screened, 51 individuals met the
inclusion criteria and were randomly assigned (Figure 1) to 1
of the following 2 sequences: a cashew and control sequence
(n = 25) or a control and cashew sequence (n = 26). All 51
subjects were included in the intent-to-treat sample, and n = 42
were included in the PP sample. Two subjects withdrew
from the study before completing any of the intervention diets
because of adverse events or an unwillingness to comply with
the study diet. Three subjects withdrew after completing 1 in-
tervention diet (2 subjects completed the cashew diet, and 1
subject completed the control diet) because of scheduling
conflicts. After completing the cashew diet, 1 subject with-
drew because of an unwillingness to comply with the diet
protocol. and 2 subjects withdrew because of adverse events.
Mean compliance rates with the consumption of study products
during the cashew and control diets was 99.6 6 0.3% and
99.5 6 0.2%, respectively (1 subject was determined to have
been noncompliant with the planned menu and showed signif-
icant deviations from the planned menu for 15 of 28 d). Of 8
subjects who terminated the study early, 1 individual returned to
provide an end-of-study lipid sample. Finally, there were no
significant (P = 0.098) differences in body weight changes
between diets, which suggested that the meal-plan design and
monitoring were generally successful at assuring the mainte-
nance of stable body weights.
Serum lipids
Values for serum lipids at baseline and at the end of each diet
for the PP sample are shown in Table 4. For 5 subjects who had
LDL-cholesterol concentrations $130 mg/dL at screening,
LDL-cholesterol concentrations dropped to ,130 mg/dL
(118–128 mg/dL) at the baseline visit. However, these subjects
were still included in the study because they met the inclusion
criteria. There were no significant differences in baseline lipid
values between control and cashew diets at the start of each
diet (i.e., at baseline and after the washout period). Compared
with the control diet, the cashew diet significantly decreased
concentrations of LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, and non-
HDL cholesterol (P , 0.05) without significant changes to
HDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. One subject
had an increase of 101% in LDL cholesterol (3.4 times the
IQR) and was identified as an outlier. When data from this
subject was excluded, the median change in LDL cholesterol

the intervention, baseline, intervention sequence, and test period. Models were reduced with the use of a backward-selection method until only significant terms or the intervention remained in the model. P
values for total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol were obtained from a final ANCOVA model that contained the baseline and intervention, and P values for HDL cholesterol, triglyceride,
and the total-cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol ratio were obtained from a final ANCOVA model that only contained the intervention. Comparisons were also done for end-of-intervention values between diets, and
these results corresponded to those for the percentages of change such that values that were significantly different for the percentage of change were also significantly different for the end-of-intervention data
and vice versa.
3 Change in the ratio was not significantly different (P = 0.126) between the control diet and cashew diet in the intention-to-treat sample [3.46% (0.62%, 5.16%) compared with 0.05% (23.18%, 5.57%),
respectively]. There were no other differences between intention-to-treat and per-protocol sample populations.

 remained significantly different (P = 0.011; PP sample) between
the cashew diet (25.9%; 95% CI: 214.37%, 6.41%) and the
control diet (1.10%; 95% CI: 24.91, 8.93).
Values for plasma fatty acids at baseline and at the end of each
dietary intervention are shown in Table 5. Oleic acid was the
most abundant MUFA in both the control and cashew diets
(Supplemental Table 1) and in plasma (Table 5). Oleic acid is
also one of the most abundant fatty acids in cashews and
comprises .50% of the total fatty acids that are present (7).
Not surprisingly, of all detectable MUFAs in plasma, oleic acid
showed the greatest increase after the cashew diet, and this
change was significantly different (P , 0.05) compared with
that of the control diet. Despite similar intakes of SFAs between
diets, the change in plasma SFAs was significantly different
(P , 0.05) between the control and cashew diets such that
plasma SFAs increased to a greater extent after the control diet
than after the cashew diet.
Adverse events
Adverse events were reported during both diets. During the
control diet, 3 adverse events were classified as being possibly
related to the study product, whereby 2 adverse events were
reported by one subject (fatigue and mild constipation), and 1
adverse event was reported by another subject (weight loss).
During consumption of the cashew diet, 8 adverse events were
classified as possibly or probably related to the consumption of
cashews, and these events included constipation, bloating, and
fatigue (reported by 1 subject), worsened arthritis (reported by 1
subject), gout flare-up (reported by 1 subject), weight gain
(reported by 1 subject), and constipation and general malaise
(reported by 1 subject). All adverse events were deemed mild to
moderate in severity by a study physician.
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this randomized, controlled
feeding study is the first report of the effect of cashews on blood
lipids in adults with high LDL cholesterol or who were at risk of
high LDL cholesterol while consuming a typical American diet.
The results of this study show that the incorporation of cashews
(28–64 g/d) into an average American diet for 4 wk improves
the serum lipid profile of adults with high LDL cholesterol or
who are at risk of high LDL cholesterol. Compared with the
control diet, the cashew diet significantly decreased LDL cho-
lesterol by 4.8% (5.9% with one outlier excluded), total cho-
lesterol by 3.9%, and non-HDL cholesterol by 5.3% without
affecting HDL cholesterol and triglyceride.
In an earlier study, subjects with metabolic syndrome were
randomly assigned into 3 groups who received an 8-wk controlled-
intake diet that included walnuts, unsalted cashews, or no nuts (11).
The consumption of the cashew diet (66–115 g/d; 37% of total
energy from fat) had no significant beneficial effect on the lipid
profile compared with the effect of the control diet that was lower
in fat (33% of total kilocalories from fat) and higher in carbo-
hydrate (47% of total kilocalories from carbohydrate). Note that
the walnut group in the current study also failed to show any
changes in blood lipids, which was inconsistent with other studies
that showed decreases in LDL cholesterol after walnut con-
sumption (weighted mean difference: 29.23 mg/dL from 11
studies) (17). The authors speculated that the low baseline con-
centration of LDL cholesterol in the study [medians: for walnuts,
116 mg/dL (95% CI: 102, 127 mg/dL); for cashews, 102 mg/dL
(95% CI: 90, 122 mg/dL), and for the control, 124 mg/dL
(95% CI: 108, 147 mg/dL)] may have contributed to the null
results. The authors observed nonsignificant increases in LDL
cholesterol in all groups [+7.0 mg/dL (+6.0% from baseline) in
the walnut group; +4.6 mg/dL (+4.5% from baseline) in the
cashew group, and +7.3 mg/dL (+5.9% from baseline) in the
control group]. It is possible that the increase in LDL cholesterol
was a result of the background diet and inadvertently masked the
possible LDL-cholesterol–lowering effect of walnuts and cashews.
In contrast, the control diet in the current study resulted in a
smaller, nonsignificant increase in LDL cholesterol of 1.2%
(Table 4).
One reason why cashews were not included in the qualified
health claim for nuts and coronary heart disease is that they
exceed the SFA disqualifying amount of #4 g/50 g serving.
Indeed, for every 50-g serving, cashews contribute w4.6 g
SFAs, which represent 20% of the total fat in cashews (7).
Overall, SFAs are known to be more hypercholesterolemic
than are MUFAs and PUFAs, although not all SFAs increase
cholesterol concentrations (8). The top 3 most-abundant SFAs
in cashews are palmitic acid, stearic acid, and lauric acid, each
of which consists of 48%, 32%, and 9% of total SFAs (weight:
weight) (7). Palmitic acid is generally regarded as hypercho-
lesterolemic although with less potency compared with that of
myristic acid (8), which is shown in smaller quantities (,5%
of total SFAs) in cashews. In contrast, stearic acid signifi-
cantly lowers plasma total-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol
concentrations when substituted for palmitic, lauric, or myris-
tic acid (18). In their review of the effect of stearic acid on
LDL cholesterol, the 2010 DGAC concluded that the impact
of stearic acid on LDL cholesterol and CVD risk is unclear
and recommended that stearic acid not be categorized with
known hypercholesterolemic fats, which include lauric acid,
myristic acid, palmitic acid, and trans fatty acids (2). Con-
sistent with this observation, and despite providing slightly
more SFAs than in control diet, the cashew diet decreased total
cholesterol and LDL cholesterol to a greater extent than the
control diet did in the current study. Moreover, plasma total
SFAs increased to a greater degree after the control diet than
after the cashew diet. This result was not surprising because of
the possible de novo synthesis of most SFAs from carbohy-
drate, which was provided at a greater amount in the control
diet than in the cashew diet.
Cashews also contribute MUFAs (60% of total fat) and PUFAs
(18–20% of total fat) (7). The incorporation of cashews into the
diet resulted in greater intake of dietary MUFAs, which are
associated with improved blood lipids (19). The change in
plasma MUFAs was significantly different between cashew and
control diets such that there was a greater increase in plasma
MUFAs after the cashew diet than after the control diet. This
increase in plasma MUFAs was largely driven by the greater
increase in plasma oleic acid after the cashew diet. Oleic acid
represents 98% of total MUFAs and 58% of total fatty acids in
cashews (7), thereby making it the most abundant fatty acid in
cashews. Epidemiologic studies have suggested that diets with a
high proportion of MUFAs in the form of oleic acid, such as in
the Mediterranean diet, reduce CVD risk (20, 21). Various

 intervention studies that have used good sources of oleic acid,
such as canola oil (22) and almonds (23), have shown favorable
effects on markers of CVD. However, these studies were limited
in that other components of these intervention foods may have
contributed to the favorable effects observed.
It has been suggested that nuts, in general, may contain bio-
active components besides fat that may affect LDL cholesterol
and other CVD risk factors (24). The decreases in LDL cho-
lesterol that were observed in our study were greater than those
that were estimated from the fatty acid composition of the diets
with the use of predictive equations (10). This outcome suggests
that the nonlipid components of cashews may play a role in
lowering serum lipids. Similar to other tree nuts, cashews are a
source of phytosterols. The total amounts of phytosterols in
cashews differ on the basis of extraction and analytic methods and
have been reported to range from 54 mg/100-g edible portion (25)
to 158 mg/100-g edible portion (7, 26) with b-sitosterol being the
major phytosterol (75–89% of total phytosterol) (25, 26). Phy-
tosterols have been shown to alter intestinal cholesterol metab-
olism through several mechanism, including competition with
cholesterol for incorporation into mixed micelles and the mod-
ulation of effects of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 transporters and
scavenger class B type 1 receptors to lower intestinal sterol
uptake. Also, the absorption of sterols into enterocytes triggers
the upregulation of ATP-binding cassette G5 and G8 trans-
porters, thereby increasing the efflux of sterols into the intestinal
lumen for excretion (27). Our study was not designed to in-
vestigate the specific components of cashews that contribute to
the lowering of LDL cholesterol, and future studies should be
geared toward identifying and characterizing the various bio-
active components of cashews that may contribute beneficial
cardiovascular effects.
In the current study, subjects had good compliance with the
consumption of study products and meals. Body weight changes
between diets were similar, which suggested that the meal-plan
design and monitoring were generally successful at assuring the
maintenance of stable body weights. Our study was not designed
to determine the effectiveness of cashew consumption in the
modulation of the lipid profile and other cardiometabolic markers
under self-selected dietary conditions. However, noncontrolled-
consumption studies that have provided different types of nuts
under self-selected dietary conditions have shown improvements
in blood lipid profiles (28), thereby suggesting that similar
beneficial effects would be expected for cashews. To better
understand the effect of cashews on CVD risk, future studies
should investigate the changes in lipoprotein particle concen-
trations such as the apolipoprotein B and LDL particle numbers
(29–31) after cashew consumption.
In conclusion, this study shows that the consumption of
cashews as part of an average American diet by men and women
with high LDL cholesterol or who are at risk of high LDL
cholesterol results in decreases in total cholesterol, LDL cho-
lesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol, consistent with the effects of
other tree nuts. Because cashews are the third most-popular tree
nut in the United States, the results are of significant public-health
importance because they fill in a knowledge gap and may provide
guidance for future dietary recommendations that are specifically
aimed at improving heart health. Future studies are needed to
confirm these findings and to further investigate the bioactive
components of cashews that contribute to cardiovascular health.
