Global, regional, and national life expectancy, all-cause 
mortality, and cause-specifi
 c mortality for 249 causes of 
death, 1980–2015: a systematic analysis for the Global 
Burden of Disease Study 2015
GBD 2015 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators*
Summary
Background Improving survival and extending the longevity of life for all populations requires timely, robust evidence 
on local mortality levels and trends. The Global Burden of Disease 2015 Study (GBD 2015) provides a comprehensive 
assessment of all-cause and cause-specifi
 c mortality for 249 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2015. 
These results informed an in-depth investigation of observed and expected mortality patterns based on 
sociodemographic measures.
Methods We estimated all-cause mortality by age, sex, geography, and year using an improved analytical approach 
originally developed for GBD 2013 and GBD 2010. Improvements included refi
 nements to the estimation of child and 
adult mortality and corresponding uncertainty, parameter selection for under-5 mortality synthesis by spatiotemporal 
 
Gaussian process regression, and sibling history data processing. We also expanded the database of vital registration, 
survey, and census data to 14 294 geography–year datapoints. For GBD 2015, eight causes, including Ebola virus 
disease, were added to the previous GBD cause list for mortality. We used six modelling approaches to assess cause-
specifi
 c mortality, with the Cause of Death Ensemble Model (CODEm) generating estimates for most causes. We used 
a series of novel analyses to systematically quantify the drivers of trends in mortality across geographies. First, we 
assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specifi
 c mortality as they relate to the Socio-demographic 
Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. 
Second, we examined factors aff
 ecting total mortality patterns through a series of counterfactual scenarios, testing the 
magnitude by which population growth, population age structures, and epidemiological changes contributed to shifts 
in mortality. Finally, we attributed changes in life expectancy to changes in cause of death. We documented each step 
of the GBD 2015 estimation processes, as well as data sources, in accordance with Guidelines for Accurate and 
Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER).
Findings Globally, life expectancy from birth increased from 61·7 years (95% uncertainty interval 61·4–61·9) in 1980 
to 71·8 years (71·5–72·2) in 2015. Several countries in sub-Saharan Africa had very large gains in life expectancy from 
2005 to 2015, rebounding from an era of exceedingly high loss of life due to HIV
/AIDS. At the same time, many 
geographies saw life expectancy stagnate or decline, particularly for men and in countries with rising mortality from 
war or interpersonal violence. From 2005 to 2015, male life expectancy in Syria dropped by 11·3 years (3·7–17·4), to 
62·6 years (56·5–70·2). Total deaths increased by 4·1% (2·6–5·6) from 2005 to 2015, rising to 55·8 million 
(54·9 million to 56·6 million) in 2015, but age-standardised death rates fell by 17·0% (15·8–18·1) during this time, 
underscoring changes in population growth and shifts in global age structures. The result was similar for non-
communicable diseases (NCDs), with total deaths from these causes increasing by 14·1% (12·6–16·0) to 39·8 million 
(39·2 million to 40·5 million) in 2015, whereas age-standardised rates decreased by 13·1% (11·9–14·3). Globally, this 
mortality pattern emerged for several NCDs, including several types of cancer, ischaemic heart disease, cirrhosis, and 
Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. By contrast, both total deaths and age-standardised death rates due to 
communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional conditions signifi
 cantly declined from 2005 to 2015, gains largely 
attributable to decreases in mortality rates due to HIV
/AIDS (42·1%, 39·1–44·6), malaria (43·1%, 34·7–51·8), 
neonatal preterm birth complications (29·8%, 24·8–34·9), and maternal disorders (29·1%, 19·3–37·1). Progress was 
slower for several causes, such as lower respiratory infections and nutritional defi
 ciencies, whereas deaths increased 
for others, including dengue and drug use disorders. Age-standardised death rates due to injuries signifi
 cantly 
declined from 2005 to 2015, yet interpersonal violence and war claimed increasingly more lives in some regions, 
particularly in the Middle East. In 2015, rotaviral enteritis (rotavirus) was the leading cause of under-5 deaths due to 
diarrhoea (146 000 deaths, 118 000–183 000) and pneumococcal pneumonia was the leading cause of under-5 deaths 
due to lower respiratory infections (393 000 deaths, 228 000–532 000), although pathogen-specifi
 c mortality varied by 
region. Globally, the eff
 ects of population growth, ageing, and changes in age-standardised death rates substantially 
diff
 ered by cause. Our analyses on the expected associations between cause-specifi
 c mortality and SDI show the 
regular shifts in cause of death composition and population age structure with rising SDI. Country patterns of

Introduction
Comparable information about deaths and mortality 
rates broken down by age, sex, cause, year, and geography 
provides a starting point for informed health policy 
debate. However, generating meaningful comparisons of 
mortality involves addressing many data and estimation 
challenges, which include reconciling marked dis-
crepancies in cause of death classifi
 cations over time and 
across populations; adjusting for vital registration system 
data with coverage and quality issues; appropriately 
synthesising mortality data from cause-specifi
 c sources, 
such as cancer registries, and alternative cause of death 
identifi
 cation tools, such as verbal autopsies; and 
developing robust analytical strategies to estimate cause-
specifi
 c mortality amid sparse data.1–6 The annual Global 
Burden of Disease (GBD) analysis provides a standardised 
approach to addressing these problems, thereby 
enhancing the capacity to make meaningful comparisons 
across age, sex, cause, time, and place.
Previous iterations of the GBD study showed 
substantial reductions in under-5 mortality, largely 
driven by decreasing rates of death from diarrhoeal 
diseases, lower respiratory infections, malaria, and, 
in 
several 
countries, 
neonatal 
conditions 
and 
premature mortality (measured as years of life lost [YLLs]) and how they diff
 er from the level expected on the basis of 
SDI alone revealed distinct but highly heterogeneous patterns by region and country or territory. Ischaemic heart 
disease, stroke, and diabetes were among the leading causes of YLLs in most regions, but in many cases, intraregional 
results sharply diverged for ratios of observed and expected YLLs based on SDI. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, 
and nutritional diseases caused the most YLLs throughout sub-Saharan Africa, with observed YLLs far exceeding 
expected YLLs for countries in which malaria or HIV/AIDS remained the leading causes of early death.
Interpretation At the global scale, age-specifi
 c mortality has steadily improved over the past 35 years; this pattern of 
general progress continued in the past decade. Progress has been faster in most countries than expected on the basis 
of development measured by the SDI. Against this background of progress, some countries have seen falls in life 
expectancy, and age-standardised death rates for some causes are increasing. Despite progress in reducing age-
standardised death rates, population growth and ageing mean that the number of deaths from most non-
communicable causes are increasing in most countries, putting increased demands on health systems.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
In 2012, the Global Burden of Disease 2010 study was published, 
providing results from the fi
 rst complete revision of the Global 
Burden of Disease (GBD) since the fi
 rst assessment in 1993. The 
study reported on mortality and causes of death between 1990 
and 2010 in 187 countries. In response to demand for up-to-date 
information on the health of populations to inform health policy 
debates, annual updates of the GBD study are now prepared, 
with the fi
 rst of these, the GBD 2013 study, published in 2015. 
For the fi
 rst time, collaborative teams undertook subnational 
assessments for China, Mexico, and the UK as part of this study. 
Added value of this study
The GBD 2015 assessment of mortality and causes of death 
provides new and more robust evidence on the health of 
populations worldwide through the inclusion of subnational data 
from an expanded group of countries, including Brazil, India, 
Japan, Kenya, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Sweden, and the USA, in 
addition to updates for China, Mexico, and the UK. This study 
complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health 
Estimates Reporting (GATHER) recommendations. Estimation of 
mortality levels, patterns, and distribution for several new causes, 
including Ebola virus disease, further disaggregations of 
carcinoma and leukaemia, motor neuron disease, and mortality 
attributable to environmental heat and cold exposure have been 
added for the GBD 2015 study. Furthermore, this analysis extends 
the concept of sociodemographic status fi
 rst reported in GBD 
2013, with important changes to computational methods, 
resulting in a new Socio-demographic Index (SDI) for a more 
robust positioning of countries and territories on the 
development continuum.
Implications of all the available evidence
This study provides the most comprehensive assessment to date 
of patterns and levels of mortality worldwide, expanding on 
previous analyses by further investigating the main determinants 
of epidemiological patterns and trends across geographies and 
over time. The GBD 2015 study entails a complete reanalysis of 
trends for each cause of death from 1990 to 2015; the time series 
published here supersedes the results of the GBD 2013 study. The 
expansion of geographic units, from 296 in GBD 2013 to 519 for 
GBD 2015, is envisaged to continue so as to sustain comparability 
over time and across all geographies. The comparison of 
estimates of observed mortality levels with patterns expected 
based on the SDI provides an in-depth understanding of national 
health challenges and priority areas for intervention.

malnutrition.7–11 Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) 
and injuries claimed increasingly more lives throughout 
the world, although age-standardised death rates fell 
for many causes and countries.7 Examination of 
epidemiological 
convergence 
among 
high-income, 
middle-income, and low-income countries showed the 
importance of evaluating both absolute and relative 
changes in mortality, as solely focusing on absolutes can 
mask rising relative inequality among certain age groups 
and causes. The GBD 2015 study expands on these 
analyses by further evaluating the drivers of epi-
demiological patterns across countries and over time. 
Such mortality trends are generally shaped by a 
combination of factors, including changes in income per 
capita, educational attainment, fertility, shifts in clinical 
care and health system responsiveness, emergent health 
threats such as disease outbreaks or increasing rates of 
obesity, and geography-specifi
 c health contexts. An in-
depth understanding of national health gains and priority 
areas for intervention can be provided by comparing 
estimates of expected mortality patterns. These results 
are of particular importance amid debates on fi
 nancing 
and policy options for the newly adopted Sustainable 
Development Goals, which include both ambitious 
targets for maternal and child health and a much broader 
health agenda also encompassing NCDs and injuries.

greater than 50 000 in the year 2000.12 In the GBD 2013 
study, 
collaborative 
teams 
produced 
subnational 
assessments for the UK, Mexico, and China, expanding 
the number of geographies included in the GBD 
analysis to 296.7,13–15 The value of such subnational 
assessments to local decision makers16 has driven 
further geographical disaggregation for GBD 2015 
including in Brazil, India, Japan, Kenya, Saudi Arabia, 
South Africa, Sweden, and the USA, in addition to 
updates for China, Mexico, and the UK. The expansion 
of the geographical units in the GBD studies will 
continue in a way that will sustain the comparability 
over time for the period 1990 to present and across all 
geographic entities.
As with all revisions of the GBD, the GBD 2015 study 
provides an update for the entire time series from 
1990 to 2015 based on newly identifi
 ed data sources 
released or collected since GBD 2013. In response to 
published commentaries and unpublished seminars 
and communications about GBD methods, various 
methodological refi
 nements have been implemented.17,18 
Additionally, in the GBD 2015 cycle, a major eff
 ort 
towards data and code transparency has been made. As 
with each GBD cycle, the full time series published here 
supersedes previous GBD studies. This detailed 
assessment of causes of death allows the exploration of 
key questions including what are the leading causes of 
deaths in each geography, which causes are increasing or 
decreasing, what is the expected pattern of change in 
causes of death with the epidemiological transition and 
how does this expected pattern over time diverge across 
geographies.
Methods
Overview
GBD employs various analytical tools and a diverse set of 
data sources to generate comparable estimates of deaths 
and mortality rates broken down by age, sex, cause, year, 
and geography. Multiple publications show more detail 
on the various aspects of the methods.7,8,12,19 Part 1 of the 
methods appendix (pp 4–51) is a structured and succinct 
explanation of each step. Figure 1 shows all of the inputs, 
analytical processes, and outputs from the analysis of all-
cause mortality and HIV/AIDS mortality, included 
because of its important eff
 ects on all-cause mortality in 
countries with large HIV epidemics, and fi
 gure 2 does 
the same for cause-specifi
 c mortality. Each input or 
process is numbered for reference, with part 2 of the 
methods appendix (pp 52–70) providing explanation for 
each step. The GBD analytical approach to estimation is 
guided by standardised solutions to some general 
analytical problems: inconsistent case defi
 nitions or 
coding over time or across geographies; missing data; 
confl
 icting data for the same year and geography; 
and population groups (eg, the poor, minorities, 
and vulnerable groups) who are often missed in 
administrative data sources. In this Article, we provide 
only a very high-level summary. This analysis adheres to 
the new Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health 
Estimates Reporting (GATHER) proposed by the World 
Health Organization (WHO) and others, which includes 
recommendations on documentation of data sources, 
estimation methods, and statistical analysis.20 Table 1 
shows the precise ways in which we have adhered to each 
element of the GATHER agreement.
Geographic units
We have organised geographies into a set of hierarchical 
categories: seven super-regions; 21 regions nested 
within the seven super-regions; and 195 countries and 
territories nested within the 21 regions (table 2). Details 
on the classifi
 cation of each geographical unit into each 
level of this hierarchy are provided in the methods 
appendix (pp 670–83). Compared with GBD 2013, we 
have 
added 
seven 
territories—American 
Samoa, 
Bermuda, Greenland, Guam, the Northern Mariana 
Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands—because 
of the availability of high-quality vital registration data. 
These territories were not previously included in the 
national totals of the USA, UK, or Denmark, and were 
included only in GBD 2013 regional totals. We have 
further disaggregated data for selected countries or 
territories into subnational units: 26 states and one 
district for Brazil, 34 provinces and municipalities for 
China, 31 states and union territory groupings for India 
that include 62 rural and urban units, 47 prefectures for 
Japan, 47 counties for Kenya, 32 states and districts 
for Mexico, 13 regions for Saudi Arabia, nine provinces 
for South Africa, two regions for Sweden, 13 regions for 
the UK (Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, England, 
and nine subregions of England), and 51 states and 
districts for the USA. At the fi
 rst subnational unit level, 
we have 256 geographic units. Subnational level 1 
geographies in the GBD 2015 analysis include countries 
that have been subdivided into the fi
 rst subnational 
level, such as states or provinces. The subnational 
level 2 category applies only to India and England. In 
this Article we present national, territory, and previously 
published subnational units in the UK.13

GBD cause list
The GBD cause list is the crucial organising framework 
for the analysis of causes of death and premature 
mortality, as well as disease incidence and prevalence 
and years lived with disability.21 The GBD cause list has 
evolved during the 25 years of the GBD study to become 
a list of causes that have public health and medical care 
importance either because they are major causes of lost 
health or because of policy relevance.7,21–24 Because 
diff
 erent levels of cause aggregation are appropriate for 
diff
 erent purposes and users, the GBD cause list is 
organised hierarchically (table 2). At each level of the 
cause hierarchy, the set of causes is mutually exclusive 
and collectively exhaustive.21 At the fi
 rst level of the 
cause list, there are three broad causes: communicable, 
maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases; NCDs; 
and injuries. At the second level of the hierarchy, these 
three causes are broken down into 21 cause groups 
such as neoplasms (cancers) or cardiovascular diseases. 
Levels 3 and 4 of the cause list provide more 
disaggregated causes. Based on policy interest and by 
approval of the GBD Scientifi
 c Council, we have added 
eight causes to the GBD cause list: Ebola virus disease, 
motor neuron disease, environmental heat and cold

exposure, squamous-cell carcinoma, acute lymphoid 
leukaemia, chronic lymphoid leukaemia, acute myeloid 
leukaemia, and chronic myeloid leukaemia. Bulimia 
nervosa has also been added as a cause of death. In 
total, there are now three causes at Level 1, 21 at Level 2, 
166 at Level 3, and 261 at Level 4. Some causes, such as 
acne, medication overuse headache, and cutaneous 
leishmaniasis, are not considered causes of death 
according to the rules of the International Classifi
 cation 
of Diseases (ICD), so the number of causes included in 
this analysis of causes of death is three at Level 1, 21 
at Level 2, 144 at Level 3, and 200 at Level 4. The 
full GBD cause list, including those for which we 
estimate deaths, is available in the methods appendix 
(pp 684–90).
Time periods
Because of the greater availability of data on all-cause 
mortality than cause-specifi
 c mortality, the all-cause 
mortality analysis for GBD 2015 covered 1970 to 2015. 
The cause of death analysis of GBD 2015 covered 1980 to 
2015. A complete set of age-specifi
 c, sex-specifi
 c, cause-
specifi
 c, and geography-specifi
 c death numbers and rates 
were generated. We present results covering diff
 erent 
periods. However, for the main global and national 
results, we have focused on trends in the past decade, 
from 2005 to 2015, and detailed fi
 ndings in 2015. Data 
visualisation tools are available online and provide results 
for each year from 1990 to 2015.
All-cause mortality and HIV/AIDS mortality
Because of the very large and changing eff
 ects of 
HIV/AIDS on all-cause mortality in several countries 
with large HIV epidemics and scarce data on all-cause 
mortality, especially in eastern and southern Africa,11 the 
estimation of HIV/AIDS mortality and all-cause mortality 
are closely linked and presented jointly in fi
 gure 1. We 
divided 
the 
estimation 
eff
 ort 
into 
fi
 ve 
distinct 
components: estimation of under-5 mortality rate (5q0); 
estimation of the adult mortality rate (45q15); age-specifi
 c 
mortality estimation; HIV
/AIDS mortality estimation; 
and addition of the eff
 ects of events such as wars, 
pandemics, and disasters, which can cause abrupt 
discontinuities in death numbers (fatal discontinuities). 
Because of the interdependencies in the estimation of 
HIV
/AIDS incidence, prevalence, and mortality and all-
cause mortality, the estimation steps shown in fi
 gure 1 
were repeated, with the HIV
/AIDS crude death rates 
produced in step 4.7 used as covariates in steps 1.5, 1.11, 
2.4, and 3.3 in the fl
 ow diagram.
Under-5 mortality estimation
Seven types of primary data contributed to the 
estimation process (oval shapes in fi
 gure 1). The most 
important set of inputs were the data for estimating the 
overall level of under-5 mortality (5q0) that were 
obtained from vital registration systems, surveys, and 
censuses. Figure 3A provides information about the 
proportion of the 519 geographies included in the 
analysis for which data were available in each year from 
1980 to 2015. Because of lags in reporting of both vital 
registration data and the release of household survey or 
census data, the availability of data was much lower for 
2014 and 2015 than for previous years. Diff
 erent data 
types, such as summary or complete birth histories, 
were processed to yield estimates for each year of the 
under-5 death rate; country-specifi
 c and year-specifi
 c 
details of the measurements are provided in the 
methods appendix (pp 4–19). Figure 3B shows the 
nature of the data and estimation process for under-5 
mortality using the example of Zambia, as well as the 
uncorrected and bias-adjusted datapoints for each

source. We used spatiotemporal Gaussian process 
regression to synthesise the sources and simultaneously 
correct for biases in specifi
 c source types.8 Bias 
corrections were made by comparison to reference 
sources, which for Zambia were the Demographic and 
Health Surveys. Further details of this estimation 
process are provided in the methods appendix (pp 4–19).
Because there are many sources for measuring under-5 
mortality, such as summary birth histories from censuses 
and surveys, that do not provide sex and specifi
 c age 
group detail, we fi
 rst estimated under-5 mortality and 
then split it into mortality for four age groups: early 
neonatal (0–6 days), late neonatal (7–28 days), post-
neonatal (29–364 days), and ages 1–4 years. Splitting into 
these age groups was based on a statistical model using 
the analysis of available data that provide breakdowns 
by age and sex. Figure 3C shows the availability by 
country–year of data used to build the model to estimate 
mortality for specifi
 c age–sex groups younger than age 
5 years. We modelled the ratio of male-to-female 
probability of death from birth to age 5 years as a function 
of both sexes’ combined under-5 mortality rate and 
country and regional random eff
 ects. We further 
disaggregated sex-specifi
 c probability of death between 
birth and age 5 by modelling the ratio between age-and-
sex-specifi
 c probability of deaths in the early neonatal, 
late neonatal, post-neonatal, and 1–4 year age groups and 
sex-specifi
 c probability of death between birth and age 
5 years. This model allowed for the association between 
these age-and-sex-specifi
 c probabilities and the under-5 
death rate to be non-linear, and included other covariates 
consisting of the death rate due to HIV
/AIDS in children 
younger than 5 years, average years of schooling among 
females of reproductive age, and country and regional 
random eff
 ects. More details, including the equations are 
provided in the methods appendix (p 18). Figure 3D 
shows an example of the empirical fi
 t for the post-
neonatal period for Bangladesh. This model was applied 
to all countries to generate the under-5 estimates for each 
geography–year.
With the estimated mortality by detailed age group, we 
generated both deaths and population estimates for the 
respective age groups for each location, sex, and year.
Adult mortality estimation
Measurements of adult mortality (45q15) were mainly 
derived from vital registration data and household surveys 
that ask about the birth and death of siblings.25 In a 
smaller set of cases, information was obtained from 
censuses or surveys about household deaths in a defi
 ned 
interval before the interview. Figure 4A shows the number 
of geographies for which data in each year were available 
for adult mortality estimation. Vital registration data were 
assessed for completeness with death distribution 
methods optimised for performance.26,27 We generated a 
best estimate of the completeness of vital registration in 
each geography over time by combining estimated 
completeness of registration for under-5 deaths with the 
results for diff
 erent intercensal periods of the application 
of three death distribution methods. These sources were 
combined by use of spatiotemporal Gaussian process 
regression—details are provided in the methods appendix 
(p 21). Data from sibling histories were corrected for 
known biases, including selection bias, zero reporter bias, 
and recall bias.7,25 Our sibling history method can also 
deal with data sparsity in many sibling survival modules 
(ie, sibling history questions and variables from surveys). 
The predictive validity of the sibling history analytical 
methods has been assessed with simulated data and 
shown to be unbiased.25 Additionally, we compared 
estimates of adult mortality rates from sibling survival 
data with completeness-adjusted vital registration data in

Nations and territories includes countries, territories, and non-sovereign states. 
Subnational level 1 includes countries that, in the GBD analysis, have been 
subdivided into the fi
 rst subnational level such as states or provinces. Subnational 
level 2 applies only to India and England. In India, states have been divided into 
urban and rural units. England has been divided into nine regions. For each level, 
the number of geographies includes the geographies at that level plus the number 
of most-detailed geographies at each higher level such that at each level of the 
hierarchy, all geographies create a collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive 
set covering the world. Likewise, the GBD cause list is mutually exclusive and 
collectively exhaustive. The three Level 1 GBD causes consist of communicable, 
maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders; non-communicable diseases; and 
injuries. Level 2 causes consist of 21 cause groups, such as neoplasms and 
cardiovascular diseases. Levels 3 and 4 consist of disaggregated causes, such as 
liver cancer and cerebrovascular disease (Level 3), and liver cancer due to 
hepatitis C and ischaemic stroke (Level 4). GBD=Global Burden of Disease. 
YLD=years lived with disability. YLL=years of life lost.

countries from which both sources are available and 
found no systematic biases from sibling survival method 
(methods appendix p 292).7,25,26 We synthesised vital 
registration data corrected for completeness and adjusted 
sibling history data into a best time series estimate of 
adult 45q15 using spatiotemporal Gaussian process 
regression. Examples of the application of these steps in 
three types of settings are shown in fi
 gure 4.
The spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression 
method used to fi
 t the model to the available data 
included lag distributed income per capita, educational 
attainment, and the estimated HIV
/AIDS death rate as 
covariates. Because the estimation of the HIV
/AIDS 
death rate used the estimate of HIV-free mortality rate by 
age and sex as an input, the entire estimation loop was 
repeated once, which dealt with this interconnection. 
Step 2.9 in fi
 gure 1 deals with situations in which 
an inconsistency exists between the spatiotemporal 
Gaussian process regression-estimated adult mortality 
rate and the separately estimated crude death rate due to 
HIV
/AIDS. When the HIV
/AIDS death rate as estimated 
from the natural history model is too high compared 
with demographic sources, there is a risk that HIV-free 
death rates are depressed to implausibly low levels. In 
step 2.9, we scaled the HIV
/AIDS crude death rate by 
imposing a maximum proportion of deaths that can be 
attributed to HIV
/AIDS, as shown in our version of 
UNAIDS’ Spectrum model, which estimates HIV
/AIDS 
prevalence and deaths by age and sex. Our adult mortality 
estimation is for ages 15–60 years (45q15), but other adult

children aged 0–4 years in locations covered by available under-5 mortality data by the total global under-5 population. Because of lags in reporting of both vital registration data and the release of

age groups that can be calculated for other purposes 
include 35q15 (ages 15–50 years, corresponding to the 
reproductive age period), and 20q50 (ages 20–70 years).
Age-specifi
 c mortality
In demographic estimation, measures of child mortality, 
adult mortality, or both are used alongside a model life 
table system to predict age-specifi
 c mortality.27–30 The UN 
mostly still uses the Coale-Demeny model life tables, 
which were based on 192 empirical tables gathered 
before 1963, and in a few cases they use the 33-year-old 
UN Model Life Table for Developing Countries.31,32 
Murray and colleagues33 developed the Modifi
 ed Logit 
Model Life Table system that is used by WHO to estimate 
age-specifi
 c mortality, which captures a much wider 
range of age patterns of mortality through the year 2000. 
The GBD approach uses three inputs to generate age-
specifi
 c mortality: 5q0, 45q15, and a relevant empirical 
reference pattern of mortality by age.7 The reference in 
the GBD system was selected on the basis of empirical 
age patterns that are closest to the population in space 
and time.7 The reference was developed with a database 
of 16 507 age patterns of mortality from settings that meet 
explicit inclusion criteria as described in the methods 
appendix (pp 34–42). Table 3 shows a summary of the 
availability of empirical age–sex patterns of mortality in 
the GBD database.
To account for the eff
 ect of HIV/AIDS on the age 
pattern of mortality, the GBD model life table system 
for locations aff
 ected by HIV/AIDS and without high-
quality vital registration data used a two-step process 
whereby we fi
 rst estimated an HIV-free age pattern of 
mortality assuming that deaths due to HIV/AIDS were 
removed. This was accomplished by use of the HIV-
free and without-fatal-discontinuity 5q0 and 45q15 
estimates, crude death rates due to HIV/AIDS in age 
Figure 4: Examples of adult mortality data availability and estimation
(A) Percentage of global adult population covered by adult mortality data from vital registration systems, sibling survival surveys, sample registration systems, or censuses, 1980–2015. 
The percentage of available data was calculated by dividing the population of adults aged 15–59 years in locations covered by available adult mortality data by the total global population aged 
15–49 years. Because of lags in reporting both vital registration data and the release of household survey or census data, the availability of data was much lower for 2014 than for previous years, 
and no data existed for 2015. Country-specifi

groups 0–4 and 15–59 years, and the methods detailed 
in the methods appendix (p 44), which reconcile the 
potential disconnect between HIV/AIDS mortality 
implied in the spatiotemporal Gaussian process 
regression estimates of all-cause mortality and those 
estimated by the Estimation and Project Package (EPP)-
Spectrum. We then added the excess mortality due to 
HIV/AIDS to specifi
 c age groups to match the with-
HIV/AIDS 5q0 and 45q15 by using the estimated age 
pattern of excess mortality due to HIV/AIDS for 
generalised and concentrated epidemics. These age 
patterns of excess mortality were based on ICD-10-
coded vital registration data from various countries, 
including high-income countries with good-quality vital 
registration data and other middle-income nations that 
are aff
 ected by HIV/AIDS such as South Africa, 
Thailand, and Trinidad and Tobago. A list of country–
years for which we obtained the empirical age pattern 
of HIV/AIDS excess mortality rate is shown in the 
methods appendix (p 313).
Figure 5 shows examples of the life table system 
estimates of age-specifi
 c mortality compared with 
observed patterns for males and females in France in 
2011. There was a very close fi
 t between the estimated 
age-specifi
 c mortality and the observed mortality.
HIV/AIDS estimation
Because HIV/AIDS estimation is so closely connected 
to all-cause mortality estimation, we discuss HIV/AIDS 
estimation separately here rather than in the later 
section about estimating other causes of death. We 
divided geographies into two broad groups: countries 
with larger epidemics and incomplete or non-existent 
vital 
registration 
systems 
and 
the 
remaining 
geographies. For the fi
 rst group of geographies for 
which we had necessary information about the 
transmission of HIV/AIDS among adults and children 
and other programme information, we fi
 tted a modifi
 ed 
version of EPP-Spectrum11,34 to the data on prevalence 
collated by UNAIDS from antenatal clinic sero-
surveillance and household surveys. EPP-Spectrum is a 
natural history model of the HIV/AIDS epidemic that 
has two distinct components. In the EPP component, 
data on the prevalence of HIV are used to back-estimate 
incidence of HIV. In the Spectrum component, the 
estimated incidence and a set of assumptions are used 
to estimate prevalence and deaths by age and sex. These 
assumptions are informed by published or unpublished 
cohort studies on the initial CD4 distribution of new 
HIV infections, rates of decline in CD4 counts, death 
rates

and

accurately refl
 ect published cohort data on CD4 
progression and death rates on and off
  ART.
At this point in the estimation process for the fi
 rst 
group of geographies, we generated two estimates of 
HIV
/AIDS. One is informed by available data on all-cause 
mortality and the statistically related association between 
all-cause mortality and the HIV
/AIDS crude death rate; 
the other is the EPP-Spectrum natural history model. In 
some locations, these estimates can be quite diff
 erent. 
Given the inherent uncertainties in both methods, for 
GBD 2015 we have adopted an ensemble model which is 
the average of HIV
/AIDS deaths for each age–sex–year 
from the two approaches. Figure 6 shows the results of 
this process using Zimbabwe as an example for incidence, 
prevalence, and deaths from HIV
/AIDS. For comparison, 
we provide prevalence data from surveys and the UNAIDS 
estimates from their 2014 round of estimation.35,36
For the second group of geographies, we estimated 
mortality due to HIV
/AIDS on the basis of vital 
registration data if available. Estimates of incidence and 
prevalence for HIV were based on calibrating Spectrum 
to match the observed numbers of HIV
/AIDS deaths after 
accounting for under-registration of the vital registration 
system. This calibration method is based on tracking 
incidence cohorts through Spectrum and adjusting 
incidence to fi
 t the observed deaths for that cohort in each 
year in a specifi
 c age group (methods appendix p 44). 
Using the methods discussed in the age-specifi
 c mortality 
section, with-HIV
/AIDS all-cause mortality was estimated 
for these countries. Depending on the subgroup 
categorisation within the second group of geographies 
(methods appendix pp 44–45), we generated the 
HIV
/AIDS-specifi
 c mortality either by applying spatio-
temporal Gaussian process regression to HIV
/AIDS 
cause-specifi
 c data from the vital registration system if 
the quality of vital registration was deemed high 
(methods appendix pp 21–26) or by using cohort incidence 
bias-adjusted mortality estimates from Spectrum.
Fatal discontinuities
The fi
 fth stage of estimation (fi
 gure 1) re-estimates 
all-cause mortality by incorporating the eff
 ects of 
HIV/AIDS and fatal discontinuities. To incorporate 
fatal discontinuities from natural disasters (eg, the 2011 
Japan earthquake and tsunami), wars, pandemics, 
wildfi
 res (eg, the Australian bushfi
 res in 2009), or 
major transportation accidents (eg, the Al Ayyat train 
accident in Egypt in 2002), we used death counts 
reported in a wide range of international databases 
such as the International Disaster Database, the 
Uppsala Confl
 ict Data Program, the International 
Institute 
for 
Strategic 
Studies 
Armed 
Confl
 ict 
Databases, the Robert S Strauss Center, and various 
internet sources for more recent events such as the 
ongoing Syrian and Yemeni confl
 icts (databases are 
listed in the methods appendix [p 270], and additional 
sources are downloadable from the online source 
tool).37–40 When multiple sources for the same fatal 
discontinuity event exist, we prioritised data from vital 
registration systems if it had the highest estimate, and 
gave least priority to data from internet searches. We 
constructed uncertainty on the basis of high and low 
estimates when available. We generated regional and 
cause-specifi
 c uncertainty intervals in relative terms 
and applied them to fatal discontinuities when only the 
mean estimate was provided by a specifi
 c source. The 
fatal discontinuity section of the methods appendix 
(pp 270–73) provides more detail on how we assigned 
fatal discontinuity deaths to diff
 erent GBD causes as 
appropriate and how we applied a cause-specifi
 c age–
sex splitting model to arrive at age-and-sex-specifi
 c 
deaths due to specifi
 c fatal discontinuity events.
Given that all-cause mortality analysis requires estimates 
of crude death rates from HIV
/AIDS as initial inputs and 
that the ensemble model changes the HIV
/AIDS-specifi
 c 
and with-HIV
/AIDS age-specifi
 c mortality rates, the all-
cause mortality and HIV
/AIDS estimation processes were 
performed twice. Crude death rates due to HIV
/AIDS and 
under-5 population estimates were generated in the fi
 rst 
run of the processes and propagated the second run of the 
processes to make the HIV
/AIDS-specifi
 c and all-cause 
mortality processes more consistent.
Causes of death estimation
The GBD cause list relies on categorical attribution of 
deaths to a single underlying cause in accordance with 
the principles outlined in the ICD. The core principle of 
the ICD is to assign each death to only the underlying 
cause of death; ie, the cause that initiated the series of 
events leading to death. We used the ICD principle of 
underlying cause of death for the primary tabulations in 
this Article. Data from vital registration sources, verbal 
autopsy studies, and other sources all adhere to the same 
principle that one death can only have one cause. The 
categorical attribution of causes of death diff
 ers from a 
counterfactual approach, which answers the question “in 
the absence of the disease of interest how many deaths 
would not have occurred?”, similar to how we estimate 
burden due to risk factors in GBD. The categorical 
attribution of causes of death also diff
 ers from excess 
mortality in people with a disease followed up over time 
in a cohort study or through linkage of a disease registry 
to vital registration data. The excess mortality in such 
studies might contain deaths that are assigned as the 
underlying cause, those that are causally related to the 
disease, and those that are due to confounding, such as 
by a common underlying risk that predisposes to the 
disease but where there are also additional pathways 
to death. These counterfactual and excess mortality 
relationships are important and need to be quantifi
 ed by 
considering the underlying risk, such as elevated fasting 
plasma glucose.
Figure 2 shows the steps in the estimation of causes of 
death, which are divided into seven categories: cause of

through vital registration systems are available from 
governments and coded to diff
 erent variants of the ICD 
including various national ICD variants. Multiple sources 
were used in addition to vital registration data, including 
verbal autopsy data, cancer registries, maternal mortality 
surveillance, census and survey data on maternal death, 
census and survey data on selected injuries, and police 
records for some injuries. Figure 2A shows how each 
type of data were processed to deal with the challenges of 
diff
 erent coding schemes, diff
 erent age group reporting, 
variation in certifi
 cation, misclassifi
 cation of HIV
/AIDS 
deaths, misclassifi
 cation of maternal HIV
/AIDS deaths, 
and incorporation of population-based cancer registry 
data. The fi
 rst and second steps in the cause of death 
database development were standardisation of multiple 
data formats to a single GBD standard, then the mapping 
of each ICD or verbal autopsy variant to the GBD cause 
map. Figure 7A shows the number of deaths captured for 
each year in the GBD causes of death database by coding 
version. In step 3, we split a small subset of data reported 
in non-GBD-standard age formats into GBD age 
categories using the global relative age pattern of 
mortality for each cause as estimated from the pooled 
data that provide full age detail. In step 4, based on expert 
judgment, some causes were not allowed for certain age–
sex groups, for example, male uterine cancer.
In step 5, deaths assigned to causes that cannot be 
underlying causes of death (ie, garbage coded) were 
reassigned to their likely underlying cause of death.4,7 
These redistribution algorithms are based on three 
approaches. For some garbage codes, such as senility or 
old age, deaths were proportionately reassigned to all 
causes that are not garbage codes for a country–age–sex–
year. For HIV/AIDS in many countries, deaths from 
HIV/AIDS have been misclassifi
 ed as opportunistic 
infections, tuberculosis, cancer, digestive diseases, and 
immune defi
 ciencies. In step 6, using methods developed 
by Birnbaum and colleagues,41 these deaths were 
identifi
 ed and reclassifi
 ed as HIV
/AIDS in select 
countries with evidence of misclassifi
 cation. In step 7, 
data from the China Center for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) vital registration system were 
re-weighted to take into account potential selection bias 
caused by a larger fraction of deaths being captured in 
hospital than out of hospital in some locations.14 Step 8 
ensured that the process of redistributing garbage codes 
or identifying misclassifi
 ed HIV
/AIDS deaths would not 
assign deaths to causes in an age–sex–country–year that 
violated age–sex or other restrictions.
Step 9 excluded vital registration sources that were less 
than 50% complete in a given geography from the 
database, because of the potential for selection bias in 
highly incomplete sources. Sources estimated to be 
50–70% complete were identifi
 ed as non-representative, 
which was information that we used in the building of 
the cause of death statistical model to increase the 
estimated data variance for these datapoints. All included 
sources were corrected to be 100% complete by 
multiplying the cause fraction in a source for a country–
age–sex–year by the estimate of all-cause mortality for 
that country–age–sex–year. Step 10 aggregated causes of 
death from most to least detailed levels of the GBD 
hierarchy, ensuring deaths for a given cause were 
representative of all branches of the hierarchy that fall 
beneath it. In step 11, deaths due to HIV
/AIDS and 
various types of fatal discontinuities were removed before 
cause fractions were computed. Because of the very large 
eff
 ects of fatal discontinuities, such as wars and natural 
disasters in some cases, and the impact of HIV
/AIDS in 
countries with large epidemics, we converted cause 
fractions to be cause fractions excluding HIV
/AIDS and 
fatal discontinuities in the denominator. Deaths from 
HIV
/AIDS and the fatal discontinuities were added back 
during the fi
 nal stages of the modelling process. Because 
many sources on maternal mortality identify deaths 
during pregnancy and the post-partum period and not 
maternal deaths, the separation of HIV
/AIDS deaths 
during pregnancy and HIV
/AIDS deaths aggravated by 
pregnancy was more complicated (methods appendix p 66).
Figure 7B provides information about the fraction of 
the 519 geographies in the analysis for which cause of 
death data were available in each year from 1980 to 2015 
for any cause, including maternal death and injuries. 
Data availability by geography–year by cause is shown in

Diseases used for reporting. Cause of death data have been reported in national variants of ICD-8, ICD-9, and ICD-10 during the interval 1980–2015. Because of lags in 
reporting of both vital registration data and the release of household survey or census data, the availability of data was much lower for 2014 than for previous years and 
no data existed for 2015. (B) Percentage of global population covered by cause-specifi

 gure is computed 
using vital registration, verbal autopsy, maternal, cancer, and injury sources. (C) Overall classifi
 cation of each GBD subnational level 1 geography by availability and 
quality of cause of death data for the period 1980 to 2015. Countries have been assigned on the basis of the available time series of data into one of six categories. The 
fi
 gure uses GBD subnational level 1 geographies because subnational level 2 cannot be easily seen on a map. Extensive complete representative vital registration was 
defi
 ned as 25 total years or more of vital registration data with an estimated 95% completeness or above. All geographies that do not meet the threshold for extensive 
complete representative vital registration are classifi
 ed as one of the following: limited years of complete representative vital registration, defi
 ned as 5 years or more of 
vital registration data with an estimated 95% completeness or above; incomplete representative vital registration, defi
 ned as at least 1 year of vital registration data 
with an estimated 70% completeness or above; more than 200 cause-years VA or non-representative VR, defi
 ned as more than 200 cause-years of verbal autopsy or at 
least 1 year of vital registration with an estimated 50% completeness or above; less than 200 cause-years of VA; or no data. Cause-years are defi

understanding of the range of quality and availability of 
data for each geography, we classifi
 ed geographies into 
six categories: extensive complete representative vital 
registration (vital registration data that are 95% complete 
and cover more than 25 years); moderate data (vital 
registration data that are 95% complete but cover fewer 
than 25 years); incomplete representative vital registration 
(all other geographies with some representative vital

sources (covering more than 20% of cause-years); limited 
verbal autopsy or other data (all others with some data 
available); and no data for any cause (methods appendix

Figure 2B shows the analytical fl
 ow chart for modelling 
diff
 erent causes of death and combining them into 
internally consistent estimates of cause-specifi
 c mortality 
that sum to all-cause mortality with uncertainty levels. 
167 individual causes of death were modelled using 
CODEm. Developed for GBD 2010,5 CODEm tests a large 
number of model specifi
 cations, comparing diff
 erent 
functional forms and permutations of relevant covariates 
for each cause of death. Models that met requirements for 
direction and signifi
 cance of the regression coeffi
  cients 
were then evaluated for out-of-sample predictive validity 
through multiple iterations of cross-validation testing. We 
then combined these models into an ensemble, weighting 
them such that top performing models (in terms of out-
of-sample prediction error on levels and trends) 
contributed the most to the fi
 nal prediction. Out-of-sample 
predictive validity testing was also used to select the psi 
parameter that determines the number of models and 
their weight in the fi
 nal ensemble (fi
 gure 8). 
For each cause of death, we ran independent CODEm 
models by sex and for countries with extensive complete 
vital registration representation and all other countries. 
We included all datapoints for the other categories of 
geographies, whereas for countries with extensive 
complete vital registration representation, we included 
only 
datapoints 
from 
those 
countries, 
so 
that 
heterogeneous data from other countries did not infl
 ate 
the uncertainty interval. 
Negative binomial models
For ten causes of death, the number of events are so low, 
including many zero counts in countries with high 
income per capita or high educational attainment, that 
CODEm out-of-sample predictive validity testing was 
unstable. For these rare causes of death, which included 
other intestinal infectious diseases, upper respiratory 
infections, diphtheria, varicella and herpes zoster, 
malaria, schistosomiasis, cysticercosis, cystic echino-
coccosis, ascariasis, and iodine defi
 ciency, we used 
negative binomial regression to develop simple models to 
predict deaths. More details are available in the methods 
appendix (pp 185–200; negative binomial models).
Natural history models
For some causes, deaths are rarely recorded in either vital 
registration data or verbal autopsy data. Partly, this is 
because of the geographical location of the deaths or 
because of the potential for systematic bias in vital 
registration data or verbal autopsy data. For 14 causes, we 
have developed natural history models in which 
incidence and case-fatality rates are modelled separately 
and combined to yield estimates of cause-specifi
 c 
mortality. We developed natural history models for 
typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, whooping cough, 
measles, visceral leishmaniasis, African trypanosomiasis, 
yellow fever, syphilis (congenital), and acute hepatitis A, 
B, C, and E. Additionally, for malaria in sub-Saharan 
Africa, we have used a natural history model based on 
the incidence estimated by the Malaria Atlas Project and 
age–sex-specifi
 c case-fatality rates estimated from 
available data. Further details on the development of 
these natural history models are available in the methods 
appendix (pp 201–26; natural history models).
Subcause proportion models
For meningitis, maternal disorders, liver cancer, cirrhosis, 
and chronic kidney disease, we estimated detailed causes 
for each of these cause groupings by modelling the 
proportion of the cause grouping (parent cause) due to 
each of the component causes. We used this approach 
because the available data on the specifi
 c causes can come 
from sources other than vital registration, such as end-
stage renal disease registries, or from too few places to 
model the death rates directly. For these causes, the 
parent cause was fi
 rst estimated with CODEm and the 
fraction of the parent due to each component cause for 
Figure 8: Distribution of out-of-sample model performance for CODEm models used for GBD 2015

each age–sex–geography–year was generally estimated 
with DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression method 
developed for the GBD studies.42,43 Details for each cluster 
of causes analysed in this way are shown in the methods 
appendix (pp 233–52; subcause proportion models).
Prevalence-based models
For Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias and atrial 
fi
 brillation and fl
 utter, there is evidence of marked 
changes over time in the propensity of individuals who 
completed death certifi
 cates to list these causes as 
underlying causes of death.44,45 These changes created 
increases in the reported death rates. Conversely, 
prevalence surveys do not show a matching increase 
in age-specifi
 c disease prevalence. Garbage code 
redistribution algorithms used in the development of the 
cause of death database have so far not accurately 
captured this shift over time in the certifi
 cation of 
underlying causes of death. For these two causes, we 
based our estimates on prevalence surveys and estimates 
of excess mortality based on deaths certifi
 ed in countries 
with the greatest proportion of deaths allocated to the 
correct underlying cause of death in recent years. In both 
cases, more detail is available in the methods appendix 
(pp 227–32; prevalence-based models). We developed 
models for prevalence and excess mortality using 
DisMod-MR 2.1.
CodCorrect
Depending on the specifi
 c data availability and details of 
individual causes, we adopted diff
 erent modelling 
strategies for each cause. We generated a set of underlying 
cause of death estimates, with uncertainty intervals, that 
equalled all-cause mortality, with uncertainty intervals, 
for each age–sex–year–geography and cause and all-cause 
mortality at the individual draw level.24 In CodCorrect, for 
each draw from the posterior distribution of each cause, 
the sum of cause-specifi
 c estimates is rescaled to equal 
the draw from the all-cause distribution (methods 
appendix p 285).
Pathogen counterfactual analysis
We used a counterfactual analysis approach to estimate 
aetiology-specifi
 c population attributable fraction for 
mortality due to lower respiratory infections and 
diarrhoeal diseases. This approach involved analysing 
changes in mortality on the basis of the estimated 
prevalence of each pathogen and relative risk of 
developing disease given pathogen exposure.
The prevalence of each pathogen in diarrhoeal cases 
was extracted from a systematic literature review and 
modelled with DisMod-MR 2.1. The odds ratios of an 
episode of diarrhoea given exposure to the pathogen 
were estimated from a reanalysis of the Global Enteric 
Multicentre Study (GEMS) that used the TaqMan Array 
Card (TAC), which is based on a quantitative polymerase 
chain reaction diagnostic (qPCR).46,47 We attributed 
mortality to all pathogens, even if the odds ratio was not 
signifi
 cant in all age groups. We corrected the estimated 
prevalence for each pathogen on the basis of conventional 
laboratory techniques, such as bacterial culture or 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), to be 
consistent with the new qPCR method. Cholera mortality 
was estimated by modelling the under-reporting to the 
WHO cholera case notifi
 cation system and applying this 
correction factor to estimate the number of cholera cases 
and deaths (methods appendix p 281). The incidence and 
mortality of Clostridium diffi
  cile was modelled with 
natural history and incidence data in DisMod-MR 2.1.
We estimated attributable mortality due to respiratory 
syncytial virus and infl
 uenza with a similar approach to 
that for diarrhoea. We used a counterfactual approach 
whereby the prevalence in patients with lower respiratory 
infection was extracted from a systematic literature review 
and modelled with DisMod-MR 2.1. The odds ratios of 
lower respiratory infections given pathogen presence were 
obtained from a meta-analysis by Shi and colleagues.48 We 
adjusted the population attributable fraction for lower 
respiratory infection mortality due to respiratory 
syncytial virus and infl
 uenza for the relative case-fatality 
rate of viral to bacterial pneumonia episodes by age. 
Haemophilus infl
 uenzae type b and pneumococcal 
pneumonia (Streptococcus pneumonia) were estimated 
with a vaccine probe approach whereby the attributable 
fraction was calculated as the ratio of vaccine effi
  cacy 
against non-specifi
 c pneumonia to vaccine effi
  cacy against 
pathogen-specifi
 c 
and 
serotype-specifi
 c 
pneumonia. 
Studies that report vaccine effi
  cacy against vaccine-type 
invasive pneumococcal disease were adjusted for the 
relative effi
  cacy against vaccine-type clinical pneumococcal 
pneumonia using a uniform distribution of uncertainty 
around this ratio.49,50
Socio-demographic Index and epidemiological 
transition analysis
In this Article, we built on GBD 201351 concepts by 
improving the interpretability of sociodemographic status 
and characterising and describing this relationship in 
more detail for years of life lost due to premature mortality 
(YLLs), as well as highlighting changes in age-standardised 
death rates, population age structure, and YLL rates. We 
have made two important changes to the GBD 2013 
computation. First, we have used only lag-dependent 
income per capita, average educational attainment in the 
population over age 15 years, and the total fertility rate. We 
excluded the mean age of the population because it is 
directly aff
 ected by death rates. Second, we have applied 
the methods used to compute the Human Development 
Index to generate an interpretable scale, resulting in 
the Socio-demographic Index (SDI).52 The Human 
Development Index method weights each component 
equally and rescales each component on a zero-to-one 
scale with zero being the lowest value observed in the time 
period 1980 to 2015 and 1 being the highest value observed.

The fi
 nal composite SDI value is the geometric mean of 
each of the components. The SDI ranges from 0·060 in 
Mozambique in 1987 to 0·978 in Washington, DC, USA, 
in 2015. The correlation of the SDI with the socio-
demographic status principal component analysis used in 
GBD 2013 was 0·982. The very high correlation is because 
the principal component analysis yields weights that are 
nearly equal across components. The advantage of the 
index is that 1 can be interpreted as the level of SDI at 
which a geography has the highest observed log income 
per capita and educational attainment and lowest fertility 
rate. We tested whether alternative lags of the components 
of SDI would provide a better predictor of outcomes such 
as life expectancy and age-specifi
 c probabilities of death. 
Using lag distributed income per capita, educational 
attainment, and the total fertility rate in the current year 
was the most predictive of these mortality outcomes 
(methods appendix p 286).
To report on aggregate results, we divided geographies 
into SDI quintiles in 2015. Quintile cutoff
 s were based 
on the entire distribution of geography–years from 1980 
to 2015, excluding populations smaller than 1 million. 
Figure 9 shows a map of the SDI level in 2015 categorised 
into fi
 ve groups including subnational geographies. 
Because SDI includes educational attainment and the 
total fertility rate, some countries which have very high 
income, such as Saudi Arabia, are classifi
 ed in the second 
quintile of SDI because of lower educational attainment 
and higher fertility rates.53
To capture the average relationships for each age–
sex–cause group, we used spline regression of death 
rates on SDI (methods appendix pp 285–86). To ensure 
a coherent set of estimated death rates for Levels 1, 2, 
and 3 in the GBD cause hierarchy for each level of SDI, 
the Level 2 death rates were rescaled such that for each 
age–sex–cause bin, the sum of Level 2 death rates 
equalled the Level 1 death rate. This procedure was 
repeated for Level 3 and Level 2 causes. These rates 
were used as the expected death rates by age–sex–cause 
and SDI. Various summary measures have been 
computed on the basis of the age–sex–cause-specifi
 c 
predictions based on SDI, including age-standardised 
death rates, age-standardised YLL rates, and life 
expectancy at birth.
To further characterise how patterns of crude death rates 
and death numbers change with SDI, we have computed 
the average population age structure associated with each 
SDI level. These population age structures have then been 
used to estimate how crude death rates and death numbers 
by cause are expected to change with rising SDI.
Decomposition of changes in global deaths
To analyse the drivers of change in the numbers of deaths 
by cause or geography, we decomposed change from 
2005 to 2015 into three explanatory components: change 
due to growth of the total population; change in the 
population structure by age or sex; and change in 
age-specifi
 c, sex-specifi
 c, and cause-specifi
 c rates. We 
refer to all changes in age-specifi
 c, sex-specifi
 c, and 
cause-specifi
 c death rates not explained by demographic 
change (population growth and ageing) as the 
epidemiological change. The observed change in the total 
number of deaths equals the net change of these three 
components.
Decomposition analyses for 1980 to 2015 and 2000 to 
2015 are shown in the results appendix (pp 6–7). The 
decomposition analysis uses methods developed in 
demographic research by Das Gupta.54 As an example, we 
describe our approach to decomposition for the 2005 to 
2015 period. We used counterfactual scenarios to 
calculate two diff
 erent sets of numbers for death. In the 
fi
 rst scenario, for population growth, the number of 
deaths in 2015 was the number expected if the total 
population increased from 2005 as observed, but the 
age–sex-specifi
 c population structure and rates of death 
were the same in 2015 as in 2005. In the second scenario, 
for population growth and ageing, the number of deaths 
in 2015 was the number expected according to the 2015 
age–sex-specifi
 c population structure, but with the 
age–sex-specifi
 c rates of death held constant to 2005. The 
diff
 erence between the number of deaths observed in 
2005 and those estimated for 2015 with the population 
growth scenario is the change in the number of deaths 
exclusively from population growth. The diff
 erence 
between the scenario for population growth alone and 
the scenario for population growth and ageing is the 
change in the number of deaths exclusively attributable 
to population ageing.
Attribution of changes in life expectancy to changes in 
causes of death
When considering the estimated levels and changes in 
all-cause and cause-specifi
 c mortality rates for each 
geographical area covered by GBD 2015, it is important 
to understand the relative contribution of changes in 
mortality due to each cause to the overall changes in life 
expectancy at birth during the same period. To examine 
the changes in life expectancy at birth between 2005 and 
2015, we have applied the state-of-the-art life expectancy 
cause-specifi
 c decomposition method developed by 
Beltran-Sanchez, Preston, and Canudas-Romo.55
YLL computation
We computed YLLs using the standard GBD methods 
whereby each death is multiplied by the normative 
standard life expectancy at each age. The normative 
standard life expectancy at birth is 86·59 years, which is 
based on the lowest observed death rates for each 5-year 
age group in populations larger than 5 million. For 
GBD 2015, we computed age-standardised mortality 
rates and YLL rates from the updated world population 
age standard developed for GBD 2013.7 Details of the 
GBD world population age standard are available in the 
methods appendix (pp 286–287 and 314).

Uncertainty analysis
To account for uncertainties that arise from sample sizes 
of data, adjustments to sources of all-cause mortality, 
model specifi
 cations in spatiotemporal Gaussian process 
regression and model life table systems, and cause-
specifi
 c model specifi
 cations and estimation, we have 
estimated uncertainty intervals in key steps of the all-
cause mortality and cause-specifi
 c mortality estimation 
processes. We have produced 1000 draws of all mortality 
metrics, including under-5 mortality rate, adult mortality 
rate, age-specifi
 c mortality rate and envelope, and 
cause-specifi
 c mortality rates and death numbers for 
each location by sex for all years covered by each 
analytical step from the posterior distribution in the 
estimation process. This allowed the quantifi
 cation and 
propagation of uncertainty into the fi
 nal quantities of 
interest. Because of computational time limitations, we 
have not propagated uncertainty in covariates used in 
cause of death models, nor have we been able to 
propagate uncertainty in garbage code redistribution 
algorithms into the fi
 nal results. Our tests on the 
estimation of under-5 mortality rates show that the 
incorporation of uncertainty for included fi
 rst stage 
model covariates such as crude death rate due to 
HIV/AIDS does not have a signifi
 cant impact on the 
fi
 nal estimates (data not shown).

Results
Global life expectancy and mortality
Global life expectancy at birth increased by 10·2 years, 
rising from 61·7 years (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 
61·4–61·9) in 1980 to 71·8 years (71·5–72·2) in 2015 
(table 4), equating to an average gain of 0·29 years per 
year. By 2015, male life expectancy had risen by 9·4 years, 
increasing from 59·6 years (59·3–60·0) in 1980 to 
69·0 years (68·6–69·4), whereas female life expectancy 
improved by 11·1 years, climbing from 63·7 years 
(63·3–64·1) to 74·8 years (74·4–75·2). On average, an 
additional 0·27 and 0·32 years of life were gained per

SDI is calculated for each geography as a function of lag-dependent income per capita, average educational attainment in the population older than age 15 years, and the total fertility rate. SDI units 
are interpretable; a zero represents the lowest level of income per capita and educational attainment and highest total fertility rate observed during 1980–2015, whereas a one represents the highest 
income per capita and educational attainment and lowest total fertility rate observed in the same period. Cutoff

year for males and females, respectively, since 1980. 
Global gains in life expectancy were generally gradual 
but steady, although catastrophic events, including the 
Rwandan genocide and North Korean famines, and 
escalating mortality due to HIV
/AIDS, had worldwide 
eff
 ects on longevity. Slower gains were achieved for life 
expectancy at 50 years, or the average number of 
additional years of life 50 year olds can anticipate at a 
given point in time. On average, 50-year-old females saw 
an increase of 4·5 additional years of life since 1980, and 
50-year-old males experienced an increase of 3·5 years. 
Annual estimates of life expectancy, by sex and geography 
are shown in the results appendix (pp 36–47).
Global mortality trends showed a 16·4% (95% UI 
14·3–18·5) increase in total deaths between 1990 and 
2015, whereas age-standardised rates of mortality fell by 
28·5% (27·3–29·8) during this time. The trend was 
similar from 2005 to 2015, with total deaths increasing by 
4·1% (2·6–5·6) and age-standardised death rates 
decreasing by 17·0% (15·8–18·1). In 2015, 55·8 million 
deaths (55·0 million to 56·6 million) occurred worldwide, 
an increase of 7·9 million deaths since 1990 and 
2·2 million deaths since 2005 (table 4). From 1990 to 
2015, total deaths rose by 21·9% (19·1–24·8) for males 
and 10·3% (7·6–13·1) for females, whereas age-
standardised death rates fell by 26·2% (24·5–27·9) for 
males and 32·1% (30·4–33·8) for females. In 2015, 
30·9 million (30·3 million to 31·5 million) males and 
24·9 million (24·5 million to 25·5 million) females died, 
representing an increase of 5·6 million male deaths and 
2·3 million female deaths since 1990. Diff
 erences in total 
deaths by sex widened over time, with increasingly more 
males dying than females; this gap grew from 2·7 million 
in 1990 to 4·1 million in 2005 and 6·0 million in 2015.
Age-standardised rates of YLLs per 100 population, a 
measure of premature mortality, fell 34·1% (95% UI 
32·5–35·6) for males and 42·1% (40·6–43·5) for females 
between 1990 and 2015. Notably, the pace of decline in 
YLL rates was faster from 2005 to 2015 (19·9%, 95% UI 
18·3–21·5 for males and 26·3%, 24·6–27·9 for females) 
than from 1990 to 2005 (17·7%, 16·2–19·2 for males and 
21·4%, 20·0–22·7 for females).
Evolution of global and super-region life expectancy, 
probabilities of death, and SDI
The diff
 erences between observed life expectancy and 
mortality rates and those expected on the basis of SDI 
 
show the complex interactions between gains in SDI and 
improved health over time. Figure 10 summarises the 
trends in observed and expected life expectancy or 
mortality at the global level and for each GBD super-region 
from 1980 to 2015. Some regions have higher than expected 
levels, whereas others have lower levels than expected.
By 2015, global life expectancy had increased faster 
than expected based on changes in SDI for both sexes, 
equating to an increase of an additional 3·06 years for 
males and 2·78 years for females (fi
 gure 10A); however, 
before 2005, gains in life expectancy were lower than 
expected, particularly for females. Observed life 
expectancy consistently exceeded expected levels over 
time in southeast and east Asia and Oceania; Latin 
America and the Caribbean; and north Africa and the 
Middle East. Furthermore, for the latter two super-
regions, gains for male life expectancy improved 
following the 1980s and 1990s, when observed levels of 
longevity were closer to expected life expectancy based

generally lower than expected based on SDI in high-
income countries and central Europe, eastern Europe, 
and central Asia. For high-income countries, however, 
observed male life expectancy converged with expected 
levels around 2005, whereas the gap between observed 
and expected life expectancy based on SDI widened for 
females in this super-region. In south Asia, where 
average SDI more than doubled between 1980 and 2015, 
observed male life expectancy consistently met or 
slightly exceeded expected levels, whereas female life 
expectancy gradually moved closer to expected levels 
based on SDI. Amid its escalating HIV/AIDS epidemic, 
sub-Saharan Africa recorded widening gaps between 
observed and expected life expectancies for both sexes 
between 1988 and 1999. From 2001 to 2015, during which 
the region’s average SDI rose by 31%, observed life 
expectancy quickly increased, particularly among 
females, nearing expected levels.
Overall, global and regional trends for observed under-5 
mortality steadily moved closer to expected levels, based 
on rising SDI, and in some super-regions, such as Latin 
America, the Caribbean, and north Africa and the 
Middle East, observed rates of under-5 mortality became 
lower than expected (fi
 gure 10B). Substantial progress 
occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, with the gap between 
observed and expected 5q0 decreasing from 0·055 in 
1980 to 0·006  in 2015. Observed under-5 mortality was 
consistently lower than expected, given rising SDI, in 
southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania, whereas the 
opposite was seen for central and eastern Europe and 
central Asia, with observed under-5 mortality exceeding 
expected levels from 1980 to 2015. With the exception of 
south Asia, super-region under-5 mortality trends did not 
substantially diff
 er by sex. Observed levels of male 
under-5 mortality in south Asia gradually neared expected 
rates of under-5 mortality over time, whereas female 
under-5 mortality remained above expected levels 
between 1980 and 2000; by 2015, however, this gap had 
narrowed considerably.
Regional trends for observed and expected 35q15, 
which represents the probability of dying between the 
ages of 15 and 50 years, were much more variable than 
life expectancy at birth or 5q0 (fi
 gure 10C). The 35q15 
age band corresponds to the reproductive period; for the 
analysis of changes in mortality with SDI, we include 
results for these age groups because of their very strong 
association with mortality from HIV/AIDS during the 
reproductive age period. Except for three super-regions 
(high income; sub-Saharan Africa; and central Europe, 
eastern Europe, and central Asia), observed levels of 
35q15 remained lower than would be expected based on 
SDI between 1980 and 2015. However, relative trends, in 
terms of proximity to expected levels of 35q15 over time 
and by sex, shifted considerably. Although observed 
rates of female 35q15 were lower than expected from 
1980 to 2015 in three super-regions (Latin America and 
the Caribbean; north Africa and the Middle East; and 
southeast and east Asia and Oceania), each super-region 
registered improvements in 35q15 over time and moved 
closer to expected levels by 2015. In sub-Saharan Africa, 
observed 35q15 for both sexes increased to well above 
expected levels between 1988 and 2000, a trend largely 
attributable to HIV/AIDS. By 2004, however, gains in 
SDI quickened in sub-Saharan Africa, and observed 
35q15 began to fall closer to expected levels at a similar 
pace. Central and eastern Europe and central Asia 
experienced the most divergent patterns for 35q15 by 
sex. For males in this super-region, observed 35q15 
remained far above expected levels of mortality based on 
SDI from 1980 to 2015, but observed 35q15 climbed 
between 1986 and 1994. This rapid rise in observed male 
mortality between the ages of 15 and 50 years, relative to 
SDI, occurred in tandem with the collapse of the Soviet 
Union and the widespread economic hardships that 
followed. The gap between observed and expected male 
35q15 began to gradually narrow during the late 1990s, 
corresponding with rises in SDI; nonetheless, gains 
stalled by 1999. For females in central and eastern 
Europe and central Asia, observed 35q15 closely followed 
expected levels from 1980 to 1990, after which observed 
mortality jumped and remained higher than expected 
35q15, based on SDI, through to 2015.
Results were similarly heterogeneous for observed and 
expected trends for 20q50, or the probability of dying 
between the ages 50 and 70 years, particularly by sex and 
rising SDI (fi
 gure 10D). First, based on gains in SDI alone, 
expected levels of 20q50 diff
 ered substantially by sex. For 
males, expected reductions for 20q50 were quite gradual 
relative to improvements in SDI, until the 80th percentile, 
after which expected 20q50 steeply fell. For females, 
expected 20q50 followed a fairly linear trend with rising 
SDI. Two regions—Latin America and the Caribbean and 
north Africa and the Middle East—experienced observed 
levels of 20q50 that were lower than expected from 1980 to 
2015 for both sexes; however, for females in north Africa 
and the Middle East, observed 20q50 shifted closer to 
expected levels of mortality after 1999. After largely 
following expected rates of 20q50 from 1989 to 1998, 
southeast and east Asia and Oceania saw observed male 
20q50 drop below expected levels. Observed female 20q50 
generally remained lower than expected for this super-
region, although observed levels approached expected 
rates from 2000 to 2003 before declining again. Although 
south Asia recorded large gains in SDI over time, from an 
average of the 25th percentile in 1980 to the 54th in 2015, 
observed rates of 20q50 remained higher than expected 
for both sexes over time. Aside from a jump in observed 
20q50 rates between 1995 and 2007, in sub-Saharan Africa, 
observed 20q50 for both sexes mainly followed the 
expected rates given rising SDI. Similar to the results for 
35q15, observed levels of male and female 20q50 in central 
and eastern Europe and central Asia followed a dissonant 
pattern over time. For males, although observed 20q50

Figure 10: Co-evolution of life expectancy and probabilities of death with SDI globally and for GBD super-regions, 1980 to 2015
(A) Life expectancy at birth and SDI; (B) under-5 death rate (5q0) and SDI; (C) probability of death between 15 and 50 years of age (35q15) and SDI; and (D) 
probability of death between 50 and 70 years of age (20q50) and SDI. Coloured lines show global and super-region values. Each point in a line represents 1 year, 
starting at 1980 and ending at 2015. In all super-regions, SDI has increased year on year so progress in SDI is associated with later years for a given super-region. 
Black lines show trajectories expected for each geography on the basis of SDI alone. GBD=Global Burden of Disease. SDI=Socio-demographic Index. 
5q0=probability of death from birth to age 5 years. 35q15=probability of death from age 15 years to 50 years. 20q50=probability of death from age 50 years to

surpassed expected rates between 1980 and 2015, observed 
20q50 escalated from 1986 to 1994, rapidly increasing the 
gap between observed and expected rates of mortality for 
several years. The diff
 erence between observed and 
expected 20q50 widened for females in central and eastern 
Europe and central Asia during this time, albeit with a 
much smaller magnitude of change. Notably, observed 
levels of male 20q50 consistently exceeded expected rates 
for high-income countries between 1980 and 1997 before 
converging. Conversely, observed 20q50 for females in 
high-income countries remained higher than expected 
from 1980 to 2015.
Global causes of death
Table 5 shows the global estimates of total deaths and 
age-standardised death rates by cause for 2005 and 2015, 
as well as the percentage change in mortality from 2005 
to 2015. Annual mortality estimates from 1990 to 2015 
and more detailed age–sex results can be viewed online.
Broadly, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and 
nutritional diseases, known as Group 1 causes for GBD, 
accounted for 20·2% (95% UI 19·7–20·7) of global deaths 
in 2015 (11·3 million, 95% UI 10·9 million to 11·6 million), 
NCDs caused 71·3% (70·9–72·0) of deaths (39·8 million, 
39·2 million to 40·5 million), and injuries resulted in 
8·5% (7·9–8·5) of deaths (4·7 million, 4·4 million to 
4·9 million). Between 2005 and 2015, Group 1 causes saw 
signifi
 cant reductions for both total deaths (decrease of 
19·7% [17·8–21·6]) and age-standardised rates (decrease of 
29·6% [27·9–31·3]). For NCDs, total deaths rose by 14·3% 
(12·6–16·0), an increase of 5·0 million deaths (4·4 million 
to 5·6 million) since 2005, but age-standardised rates 
decreased from 719·1 deaths (711·9–727·3) per 100 000 in 
2005 to 624·7 deaths (615·8–634·5) per 100 000 in 2015 
(decrease of 13·1%, 11·9–14·3). Injuries caused about 
4·7 million deaths in both 2005 and 2015, but the age-
standardised rates due to injuries signifi
 cantly declined 
during this time, decreasing by 15·8% (12·4–18·7) from 
78·6 deaths (73·5–80·8) per 100 000 in 2005 to 66·2 deaths 
(61·5–68·7) per 100 000 in 2015.
Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional 
diseases
Marked reductions in total deaths and age-standardised 
death rates were achieved for many of the world’s most 
important communicable diseases. Total HIV
/AIDS 
deaths fell 33·4% (95% UI 30·0–36·2), from 1·8 million 
(95% UI 1·7 million to 1·9 million) in 2005 to 1·2 million 
(1·1 million to 1·3 million) in 2015, and age-standardised 
death rates dropped even more rapidly (reduction of 
42·1%, 39·1–44·6). Globally, HIV
/AIDS mortality peaked 
in 2005, underscoring the continued expansion of ART 
and PMTCT. Malaria deaths decreased by 37·4% 
(27·8–47·0), falling to 730 500 (555 800–904 000) in 2015. 
Age-standardised death rates due to malaria fell slightly 
more rapidly (43·1%, 34·7–51·8) during this time; 
nonetheless, this rate of decline only partly represents the 
sustained gains against malaria, given that mortality 
peaked in 2003, claiming 1·2 million lives (1·0 million to 
1·4 million) that year. Age-standardised death rates due to 
diarrhoeal diseases fell 32·2% (27·7–36·5) from 2005 to 
2015, although total deaths fell more slowly (20·8%, 
15·4–26·1) to 1·3 million deaths (1·2 million to 1·4 million). 
Other communicable diseases that had signifi
 cant 
reductions in mortality included tetanus (decreased by 
47·5% [95% UI 39·0–54·6], to 56 700 deaths [48 200–80 000]), 
measles (decreased by 75·0% [58·8–84·5], to 73 400 deaths 
[26 100–161 400]), and African trypanosomiasis (decreased 
by 75·3% [67·9–81·4], to 3510 deaths [1790–5660]).
Amid these gains, less pronounced progress occurred 
for several communicable diseases, and fatalities climbed 
rapidly for others, such as Ebola virus disease. 
Tuberculosis, which killed fewer people than HIV/
AIDS in 2005 (1·3 million, 95% UI 1·2 million to 
1·7 million), essentially matched HIV
/AIDS’s toll by 
2015, causing 1·1 million deaths (0·91 million to 
1·4 million). Deaths due to tuberculosis decreased by 
17·4% (11·3–24·4) between 2005 and 2015; however, age-
standardised tuberculosis death rates dropped by 33·8% 
(28·7–39·6). Total mortality due to lower respiratory 
infections remained fairly constant from 2005 to 2015 
(between 2·8 million and 2·7 million deaths), although 
age-standardised death rates fell by 19·5% (16·9–22·3); 
a similar trend was observed for meningitis. Deaths due 
to hepatitis and age-standardised death rates decreased 
(deaths 
fell 
by 
14·0% 
[10·0–17·9], 
to 
106 000 
[101 000–111 000], and death rates fell by 28·0% 
[24·7–31·1]), which was mainly driven by signifi
 cant 
reductions in deaths due to acute hepatitis A (decrease of 
34·0% [24·2–43·5], to 11 000 [7000–16 000]) since 2005. 
Mortality due to other types of hepatitis improved less 
rapidly. Dengue deaths increased by 48·7% (15·1–90·9), 
resulting in 18 400 deaths (11 800–22 700) in 2015, and 
Chagas disease, which largely aff
 ects populations in 
Latin America, claimed 8000 lives (7500–8600) that year. 
Deaths due to leishmaniasis increased, albeit not 
signifi
 cantly, 
between 
2005 
and 
2015, 
causing 
24 200 deaths (17 100–32 500) in 2015. The peak of the 
west African Ebola virus disease outbreak occurred in 
2014, causing 12 800 deaths (10 300–15 300) that year. In 
2015, 5500 people (4400–6600) died from Ebola virus 
disease, mainly in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.
Among the leading causes of global maternal mortality, 
most showed signifi
 cant reductions in both total deaths 
and age-standardised death rates between 2005 and 2015. 
Deaths due to maternal haemorrhage decreased by 16·6% 
(95% UI 3·2–28·8), claiming 16 600 (3300–29 800) fewer 
lives in 2015, and deaths due to abortion, miscarriage, 
and ectopic pregnancies dropped by 23·1% (11·1–33·9), 
to 32 000 (25 000–40 000); age-standardised death rates fell 
by 25·0% (12·9–35·9) for maternal haemorrhage and by 
30·7% (19·8–40·4) for abortion, miscarriage, and ectopic 
pregnancies. For neonatal disorders, total deaths fell by 
18·5% (16·4–20·4) and age-standardised death rates fell

by 22·8% (–24·6 to –20·9)  from 2005 to 2015, to 
2·2 million (2·1 million to 2·2 million). Preterm birth 
complications caused 282 200 (215 000–353 500) fewer 
deaths in 2015 than in 2005 (reduction of 25·9%, 
20·6–31·3) and age-standardised rates dropped by 29·8% 
(24·8–34·9). Total deaths and age-standardised death 
rates due to neonatal encephalopathy also decreased 
signifi
 cantly during this time, albeit at a more moderate 
pace. Overall, these trends probably refl
 ect a combination 
of decreasing fertility rates, improved maternal care, and 
safer delivery practices in many settings.
Notably 
less 
progress 
occurred 
for 
nutritional 
defi
 ciencies, which caused 405 700 deaths (95% UI 
331 700–495 600) in 2015. In 2015, iron-defi
 ciency anaemia 
led to 54 200 deaths (35 100–72 900) and protein-energy 
malnutrition caused 323 200 deaths (264 900–400 800); in 
combination, nutritional defi
 ciencies accounted for 3·6% 
(2·7–4·1) of lives lost to Group 1 disorders. Age-
standardised death rates signifi
 cantly decreased for 
nutritional defi
 ciencies (decreased by 24·3%, 14·3–32·9).
Non-communicable diseases
In 2015, the leading causes of NCD deaths were 
cardiovascular disease (17·9 million, 95% UI 17·6 million 
to 18·3 million), cancers (8·8 million, 8·6 million to 
8·9 
million), 
and 
chronic 
respiratory 
diseases 
(3·8 million, 3·7 million to 3·9 million). The global death 
toll due to cancers increased by 17·0% (95% UI 14·8–19·3) 
between 2005 and 2015, although age-standardised rates 
of death fell by 10·0% (8·3–11·6). Tracheal, bronchus, 
and lung cancer (total deaths 1·7 million, 1·7 million to 
1·8 million) were the leading causes of cancer deaths, and 
also had the highest age-standardised death rate 
(26·6 deaths [25·9–27·4] per 100 000) among cancers in 
2015. For several cancers, total deaths increased by 20% 
or more between 2005 and 2015, including tracheal, 
bronchus, and lung cancer (20·1% [16·7–24·0], to 1·7 
million deaths [1·7 million to 1·8 million); colon and 
rectum cancer (23·2% [20·6–26·0], to 832 000 deaths 
[811 700–854 500]); malignant skin melanoma (27·2% 
[20·0–32·6], to 59 800 deaths [47 600–72 700]); pancreatic 
cancer 
(30·8% 
[28·3–33·6], 
to 
411 600 
deaths 
[403 600–420 700]); 
and 
prostate 
cancer 
(31·9% 
[28·2–35·4], to 365 900 deaths [303 500–459 600]). Breast 
and ovarian cancers, which largely, if not exclusively, 
aff
 ect females, caused signifi
 cantly more deaths in 2015 
than in 2005 (breast cancer increased by 21·3% 
[14·9–27·2], to 534 000 deaths [502 000–553 000]; ovarian 
cancer increased by 20·4% [16·5–24·4], to 161 000 deaths 
[157 000–167 000]); however, age-standardised death rates 
for both cancers signifi
 cantly declined during this time 
(breast cancer decreased by 6·8% [2·5–11·5] and ovarian 
cancer decreased by 7·9% [4·9–10·8]). The largest 
reductions in death rates from 2005 to 2015 were recorded 
for oesophageal cancer, which fell by 26·8% (22·9–30·3) 
and Hodgkin’s lymphoma, which fell by 23·9% 
(20·1–27·7). At the same time, signifi
 cant increases 
occurred in age-standardised death rates due to non-
melanoma skin cancer (increased by 7·6%, 3·4–11·1) and 
mesothelioma (increased by 7·8%, 3·6–11·6).
Global cardiovascular disease deaths rose by 12·5% 
(95% UI 10·6–14·4) between 2005 and 2015, whereas 
age-standardised rates of death due to cardiovascular 
disease fell 15·6% (14·2–16·9). These reductions were 
largely driven by declining mortality rates due to 
cerebrovascular disease (ie, stroke; decreased by 21·0%, 
19·2–22·8) since 2005. Globally, deaths due to ischaemic 
heart disease increased by 16·6% (14·6–18·6) from 2005 
to 2015 to 8·9 million deaths (8·8 million to 9·1 million), 
whereas age-standardised mortality rates for ischaemic 
heart disease decreased at a more moderate pace (fell by 
12·8%, 11·4–14·2). Ischaemic heart disease and stroke 
accounted for 15·2 million deaths (15·0 million to 
15·6 million) in 2015, equating to 85·1% (84·7–85·5) of 
all deaths due to cardiovascular disease that year. Among 
respiratory conditions, age-standardised death rates fell 
by 22·9% (20·0–25·4) for chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) and by 31·3% (19·4–38·9) for asthma; 
total deaths due to these causes did not signifi
 cantly 
diff
 er from 2005 to 2015. By contrast, for interstitial lung 
disease and pulmonary sarcoidosis, signifi
 cant increases 
occurred in total deaths, which rose by 51·5% (37·9–60·5) 
to 121 800 deaths (94 100–135 200), and age-standardised 
rates, which rose by 14·1% (4·1–20·9) from 2005 to 2015.
Mortality patterns were similar for other leading NCD 
causes of death. Age-standardised mortality rates decreased 
for all subtypes of cirrhosis, yet total deaths increased to 
1·3 million in 2015 (95% UI 1·2 million to 1·4 million). 
Total mortality also increased from 2005 to 2015 for 
diabetes, which rose by 32·1% (95% UI 27·7–36·3), to 
1·5 million deaths (1·5 million to 1·6 million), and chronic 
kidney disease, which rose by 31·7% (27·7–35·6), to 
1·2 million deaths (1·1 million to 1·3 million); by contrast, 
changes in age-standardised death rates due to diabetes 
and chronic kidney disease were not statistically signifi
 cant. 
Chronic kidney disease due to diabetes mellitus caused 
signifi
 cantly more deaths in 2015 than in 2005 (an increase 
of 39·5% [35·4–43·5], to 418 000 deaths [389 000–441 000]), 
and age-standardised death rates also rose 6·4% (3·3–9·3). 
Global deaths due to Alzheimer’s disease and other 
dementias increased by 38·2% (36·2–40·1), to 1·9 million 
deaths (1·6 million to 2·2 million), which was largely 
driven by population ageing, given that age-standardised 
mortality decreased by 2·7% (1·7–3·7). Notably, both total 
deaths and age-standardised death rates due to alcohol use 
disorders signifi
 cantly dropped from 2005 to 2015, falling 
by 12·6% (7·0–16·7), to 138 000 deaths (131 000–144 000), 
and 29·2% (24·7–32·4), respectively. However, drug use 
disorders claimed increasingly more lives, resulting in a 
rise of 31·8% (20·4–39·4; rising to 170 000 deaths, 
152 000–179 000) since 2005. Deaths due to opioid use 
disorders accounted for 71·9% (69·5–73·3) of these drug-
related deaths in 2015, increasing by 29·6% (18·2–37·2) to 
a total of 122 100 deaths (109 500–129 700) that year.

Injuries
In 2015, transport injuries caused 1·5 million deaths 
(95% UI 1·4 million to 1·5 million), unintentional injuries 
resulted in 1·8 million (1·6 million to 1·9 million), and 
intentional injuries, including self-harm and interpersonal 
violence, led to 1·2 million (1·1 million to 1·3 million). 
Although total deaths did not signifi
 cantly change between 
2005 and 2015, age-standardised death rates fell by 16·2% 
(11·8–20·8) for transport injuries, 17·8% (13·4–20·4) for 
unintentional injuries, and 16·3% (12·6–20·1) for 
intentional injuries. Age-standardised death rates for road 
injuries and most types of road injuries, including 
pedestrian, cyclist, and motor vehicle injuries, signifi
 cantly 
decreased from 2005 to 2015. Notably, deaths due to falls 
increased by 20·9% (14·6–27·2) between 2005 and 2015 
(to 527 000 deaths, 468 000–555 000), which probably 
refl
 ects global shifts in ageing rather than a rise in injury 
risk given that age-standardised death rates fell by 5·5% 
(0·8–10·1). For drowning, there were signifi
 cant 
reductions in both total deaths (decreased by 19·7% 
[14·2–23·6], to 324 000 deaths [286 000–347 000]) and age-
standardised death rates (decreased by 28·5%, 23·8–31·8). 
Total deaths due to self-harm and interpersonal violence 
remained relatively unchanged since 2005, but age-
standardised deaths fell by 16·3% (11·2–21·5) and 16·4% 
(13·1–19·1), respectively. Assault by fi
 rearms, which 
accounted for 42·4% (40·4–43·9) of all interpersonal 
violence deaths, claimed 173 100 lives (149 300–183 200) in 
2015, and in contrast with all other causes of interpersonal 
violence, total deaths signifi
 cantly increased since 2005 
(rose by 6·3%, 2·4–11·0).
Mortality trends due to natural disasters and war were 
 
highly irregular (fi
 gure 11). By decade, the numbers of 
war deaths were higher in the 1970s and 1980s, then fell 
in the 1990s and in the fi
 rst decade of the 21st century. 
Conversely, between 2010 and 2015, mortality due to war 
(collective violence and legal intervention) increased, 
rising to 171 300 (88 100–251 100) in 2015. More than 
40·6% (34·8–45·1) of these deaths occurred in Syria and 
Yemen (70 000 deaths, 33 000–107 000). These numbers 
of war fatalities remain much lower than those recorded 
in 1993 and 1994, when more than 626 000 lives were lost 
to the Rwandan genocide, the Iraq civil war, ongoing 
armed confl
 ict in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and other

occurrences of collective violence; nonetheless, the rising 
number of casualties in the Middle East represents the 
largest increase in war deaths since 1995. Because of 
deaths in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, war 
deaths have increased during 2014–15. Between 2004 and 
2010, natural disasters claimed thousands of lives, 
including 226 000 from the Indonesian earthquake and 
tsunami in 2004; 74 700 from earthquakes in India and 
Pakistan, as well as 1870 from Hurricane Katrina in the 
USA in 2005; 87 900 from an earthquake in China and 
138 000 from a cyclone in Myanmar in 2008; and 223 000 
from the earthquake in Haiti in 2010. In 2015, natural 
disasters caused 11 800 deaths (7160–16 400), mainly due 
to the Nepal earthquake and fl
 oods in India.
In general, age-standardised death rates for males and 
females by cause are highly correlated at the global level 
(fi
 gure 12). For most causes, male age-standardised 
death rates are higher than for females. Death rates are 
notably higher in males for many cancers including 
tracheal, bronchus, and lung, liver, oesophageal, bladder, 
and larynx cancer, and mesothelioma. Male age-
standardised death rates are also higher for many 
injuries including road injuries, self-harm, falls, and 
interpersonal violence. For a small number of causes, 
female age-standardised rates are higher than for males, 
including breast cancer, rheumatic heart disease, 
gallbladder and biliary cancer, whooping cough, 
rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid cancer, and multiple 
sclerosis, and other musculoskeletal disorders.
Decomposition analysis of changes in global mortality
Drivers of global changes in mortality—population 
growth, ageing, and changes to age-standardised rates of 
cause-specifi
 c mortality—varied substantially by cause 
from 2005 to 2015 (fi
 gure 13). Among the leading 30 causes 
of death worldwide, changes in total death tolls ranged 
from a reduction of 37·4% (95% UI 27·8–47·0) for malaria 
to an increase of 38·2% (36·2–40·1) for Alzheimer’s 
disease and other dementias. Population growth accounted 
for increases in numbers of deaths across all 30 causes, but 
its contribution ranged from less than 9% for several types 
of cancer, including lung cancer and liver cancer, to 22·9% 
for malaria. In fact, for malaria, as well as a subset of other 
Group 1 causes (ie, preterm birth complications, neonatal

encephalopathy, and meningitis), population growth was 
the only factor that hindered further reductions in 
mortality. Population ageing led to increasing mortality for 
most causes, but its relative contribution ranged from less 
than 4% for interpersonal violence and diarrhoeal diseases 
to 29·6% for Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. 
Shifts in population age structures also accounted for 
more than 23% of increased mortality due to cardiovascular 
disease (ischaemic heart disease and stroke), 24·2% for 
COPD, and at least 20% for several types of cancer (eg, 
pancreatic cancer and oesophageal cancer). Conversely, for 
some causes, namely neonatal conditions and causes that 
largely aff
 ect children, such as malaria, population ageing 
contributed to decreasing levels of mortality. Except for 
pancreatic cancer, changes in age-specifi
 c and cause-
specifi
 c rates of death drove reductions in deaths due to 
the 28 other leading causes. Declines attributable to 
changes in age-specifi
 c and cause-specifi
 c mortality rates 
markedly diff
 ered, with several causes experiencing 
reductions of more than 40% (eg, malaria [58·2%], 
HIV
/AIDS [54·8%], tuberculosis [41·9%], and diarrhoeal 
diseases [41·0%]) and others showing much smaller 
decreases (eg, chronic kidney disease [2·4%] and diabetes 
[3·1%]). Notably, patterns were less distinct for most 
injuries because population growth and shifts in age-
specifi
 c and cause-specifi
 c mortality rates had relatively 
similar contributions to changes in deaths due to road 
injuries, self-harm, and interpersonal violence. Falls were 
the exception, with a combination of population growth 
and ageing mainly driving its rising death toll.
Global YLLs
From 2005 to 2015, changes in the relative ranks of YLLs, 
emphasised the increasing complexity of global mortality 
patterns (fi
 gure 14). The top three causes of YLLs—
ischaemic heart disease, stroke (which includes both 
ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke), and lower 
respiratory infections—all saw reductions in age-
standardised rates between 2005 and 2015, but changed 
minimally in rankings. In 2005, the causes ranked fourth 
to eighth were all communicable diseases (HIV/AIDS 
[fourth], diarrhoeal diseases [sixth], and malaria 
[seventh]) 
or 
neonatal 
disorders 
(preterm 
birth 
complications [fi
 fth] and neonatal encephalopathy 
[eighth]). By 2015, both total and age-standardised rates 
of YLLs had signifi
 cantly decreased for all of these causes, 
but their relative rankings did not substantially change; 
the exceptions were HIV
/AIDS, which fell to seventh, 
and malaria, which dropped to ninth. Road injuries, 
COPD, and congenital anomalies, ranked as ninth, tenth, 
and 11th leading causes of YLLs in 2005, remained largely 
the same in terms of ranks in 2015, with only road 
injuries moving up by one spot to rank eighth. YLLs due 
to road injuries fell signifi
 cantly between 2005 and 2015, 
both in terms of total YLLs, which decreased by 8·1% 
(95% UI 3·3–13·3), and age-standardised rates, which 
decreased by 18·5% (14·3–23·1). Among the top 
ten leading causes, premature mortality due to malaria 
decreased the most, with total YLLs falling by 40·1% 
(29·4–50·2) and age-standardised rates dropping 44·7% 
(34·9–54·1).
More pronounced shifts in YLL ranks and percentage 
changes between 2005 and 2015 occurred beyond the 
leading 11 causes, particularly for several NCDs. Total 
YLLs due to diabetes rose 25·4% (95% UI 20·4–30·0) 
and diabetes advanced from being ranked 18th to 15th. 
Similar increases occurred for chronic kidney disease 
(18·4% [13·8–23·1] for total YLLs and rising from 21st to

17th) and Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias 
(30·5% [28·6–32·4] for total YLLs and increasing from 
30th to 25th). Several types of cancer, including colon 
and rectum cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and 
brain cancer, showed signifi
 cant increases in total YLLs 
and relative ranks by 2015; however, none of these 
cancers had signifi
 cant increases in age-standardised 
rates of YLLs. Among NCDs, only asthma (ranked 32nd 
in 2005 and 37th in 2015) and rheumatic heart disease 
(ranked 41st in 2005 and 43rd in 2015) had signifi
 cant 
reductions for both total YLLs and age-standardised 
rates. By contrast, larger declines for total YLLs 
and age-standardised rates occurred for several 
leading 
Group

causes, 
including 
tuberculosis 
(20·5% [14·9–26·0] and 33·7% [29·1–38·3], respectively); 
protein-energy malnutrition (22·9% [4·8–38·1] and 
29·4% [13·0–43·0], respectively); and most notably, 
measles (75·0% [58·9–84·4] and 76·7% [61·8–85·5], 
respectively). In general, changes in total YLLs and age-
standardised rates due to injuries suggested reduced 
levels of premature mortality; the main exception was 
early deaths due to war, which climbed from the 
92nd leading cause of YLLs in 2005 to 38th in 2015, and 
increased more than 350% for total YLLs and age-
standardised rates of early death. Additional comparisons 
for changes in YLLs across diff
 erent years between 1990 
and 2015 can be explored online.
Causes of child death
Globally, under-5 deaths decreased by 27·2% (95% UI 
25·2–29·0) between 2005 and 2015, reaching 5·8 million 
deaths (95% UI 5·6 million to 6·0 million). Group 1 
causes, which include communicable, maternal, neonatal, 
and nutritional conditions, led to 80·8% (79·5–82·3; 
4·7 million deaths, 4·6 million to 4·8 million) of under-5 
deaths, NCDs caused 13·8% (12·6–14·9; 804 000 deaths, 
733 000–868 000), and injuries accounted for 5·4% 
(4·6–6·0; 313 000 deaths, 265 000–348 000) of deaths. Of 
the selected causes shown in table 6, neonatal disorders, 
which can aff
 ect children beyond the neonatal period 
(ie, infants younger than 1 month), caused 37·2% 
(36·0–38·3) of under-5 deaths, equating to 2·2 million 
deaths (2·1 million to 2·2 million) in 2015; these 
causes included preterm birth complications, neonatal 
encephalopathy, neonatal sepsis, and other neonatal 
disorders. 62 Group 1 causes of under-5 deaths were 
lower 
respiratory 
infections 
(12·1% 
[11·2–13·1], 
703 000 deaths [651 000–763 000]); diarrhoeal diseases 
(8·5% [7·7–9·5], 499 000 deaths [447 000–558 000]); 
malaria (8·1% [5·7–10·7], 474 000 deaths [333 000–624 000]); 
nutr

[147 000–248 000]); and meningitis (3·0% [2·3–3·9], 
173 000 deaths [137 000–229 000]). Congenital anomalies, 
which include congenital heart anomalies, led to 8·5% 
(7·7–9·5) of under-5 deaths in 2015 (497 000 deaths,

444 000–555 000), and other NCDs, such as sudden infant 
death syndrome, accounted for 9·0% (8·1–9·9) of under-5 
deaths that year (522 000 deaths, 470 000–580 000).
Neonatal 
deaths, 
which 
accounted 
for 
45·0% 
(44·9–45·2) of total under-5 deaths in 2015, decreased by 
20·3% (95% UI 18·7–21·8), falling from 3·3 million 
(3·2 million to 3·3 million) in 2005 to 2·6 million 
(2·6 million to 2·7 million) in 2015. Neonatal 
causes, mainly preterm complications and neonatal 
encephalopathy, accounted for 77·5% (76·0–79·5) of 
deaths among neonates (766 000 deaths, 700 000–854 000), 
followed by neonatal sepsis, congenital anomalies, and 
lower respiratory infections. Tetanus had the largest 
reduction in neonatal deaths between 2005 and 2015, 
falling 57·7% (50·0–64·2) to 19 900 deaths (17 000–23 400), 
followed by malaria, which fell by 55·9% (41·1–67·8) to 
13 900 deaths (8 930–19 800). Smaller improvements were 
achieved in the reduction of neonatal deaths from sepsis 
and congenital anomalies.
Among children aged 1–59 months, total deaths fell by 
32·1% (95% UI 29·7–34·2) from 2005 to 2015, with 
1·5 million (1·2 million to 1·8 million) fewer children in 
this age group dying in 2015. Lower respiratory infections, 
diarrhoeal diseases, and malaria caused 57·0% (49·7–64·6) 
of deaths among children aged 1–59 months, leading to a 
total of 1·8 million deaths (1·6 million to 2·1 million). 
Other leading causes of death for this age group included 
congenital anomalies (254 000 deaths, 224 000–297 000), 
nutritional defi
 ciencies (193 000 deaths, 147 000–248 000), 
and meningitis (147 000 deaths, 117 000–196 000). Deaths 
due to measles fell by 75·1% (59·6–84·5), the largest 
reduction among this age group, to 62 600 deaths 
(22 400–136 000), followed by tetanus, which fell by 55·2% 
(39·3–66·4) to 5560 deaths (4140–7760), and HIV
/AIDS, 
which fell by 51·9% (49·6–54·2), to 88 900 deaths 
(84 300–93 700). Nearly all of these leading causes of death 
showed some form of reduction from 2005 to 2015; 
neonatal sepsis and congenital anomalies were exceptions, 
both of which had, albeit not signifi
 cant, increases in 
deaths since 2005.
Lower respiratory infections and diarrhoea by 
pathogens
In 2015, we estimated that 1·3 million deaths (95% UI 
1·2 million to 1·4 million) were caused by diarrhoeal 
diseases, including 499 000 (447 000–558 000) in children 
younger than 5 years, representing 8·6% (7·7–9·5) of all 
deaths in this age group. Reductions in under-5 deaths 
due to diarrhoeal diseases exceeded the rate of change for 
all other age groups. Rotaviral enteritis (rotavirus) was 
the leading cause of diarrhoeal death in children younger 
than 5 years globally (29·3% [24·6–35·9%], 146 500 deaths 
Figure 13: Global decomposition of changes in leading 30 causes of death, 2005 to 2015
Changes due to population growth, population ageing, and changes in age-specifi
 c mortality rates are shown. Causes are reported in descending order by total 
number of deaths for all ages and both sexes combined in 2015. The black circle shows the overall median percentage change in global deaths from 2005 to 2015. 
Causes with increases in overall death rates have a circle to the right of the zero, whereas a circle to the left of the zero denotes causes with decreases in overall death 
rates. The contributions of population growth, ageing, and change in age-specifi
 c death rates sum to the total change in numbers of deaths.

[118 000–183 500]) in 2015 followed by cryptosporidiosis 
(Cryptosporidium; 12·1% [2·8–26·9], 60 400 deaths 
[13 700–134 500]) 
and 
shigellosis 
(Shigella; 
11·0% 
[5·5–18·7], 54 900 deaths [27 000–94 700]). Rotavirus was 
also the leading cause of mortality due to diarrhoea in all 
ages (15·2% [12·9–18·1], 199 200 deaths [165 500–241 200]), 
followed by Shigella (12·5% [6·4–21·2], 164 300 deaths 
[85 000–278 700]) and other Salmonella infections (6·9% 
[2·7–13·9], 90 300 deaths [34 100–183 100]; table 7). 
Adenovirus was an important cause of mortality due to 
diarrhoea in children younger than 5 years, accounting 
for nearly 10% of such deaths in this age group (9·2 
[3·3–19·7], 46 000 deaths [16 200–97 700]). Mortality due 
to Clostridium diffi
  cile was the lowest among all diarrhoea 
causes, but was a major cause of diarrhoea mortality in 
high-income countries. Moreover, it was the only cause 
for which the attributable fraction increased from 2005 to 
2015 (increased by 36·3%, 11·3–65·6). During this same 
time period, the only attributable fraction to signifi
 cantly 
decrease was for rotavirus (decreased by 14·1%, 
6·3–20·5; table 7).
We estimated that 2·7 million (95% UI 2·5 million to 
2·9 million) deaths occurred in 2015 due to lower 
respiratory infections, of which 704 000 (651 000–763 000) 
occurred among children younger than 5 years, 
representing 12·1% of deaths in this age group. From 
2005 to 2015, the number of deaths due to lower respiratory 
infections decreased by 3·25% (−0·45 to 6·94) globally in 
all age groups, but decreased by 36·9% (31·6–42·0) in 
children younger than 5 years. Pneumococcal pneumonia 
and H infl
 uenzae type b together accounted for nearly 65% 
of deaths due to lower respiratory infections in children

Causes are connected by lines between time periods. For the time periods 1990 to 2005 and 2005 to 2015, three measures of change are shown: percent change in the number of YLLs, percent change 
in the all-age YLL rate, and percent change in the age-standardised YLL rate. Statistically signifi
 cant changes are shown in bold. YLLs=years of life lost. COPD=chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

younger than 5 years (table 7). The attributable fraction of 
deaths due to lower respiratory infection caused by 
pneumococcal pneumonia was highest in children 
younger than 5 years (55·8%, 32·5–75·0) and all ages 
(55·4%, 31·5–79·1). The percentage of under-5 deaths due 
to H infl
 uenzae type b decreased by 60·7% (56·8–65·7), 
from 13·4% (−0·8 to 24·7) in 2005 to 8·3% (−0·5 to 15·9) 
in 2015, with 58 700 deaths (−3130 to 115 000) recorded in 
2015. Respiratory syncytial virus (5·2% [2·9–8·6], 
36 400 deaths [20 400–61 500]) and infl
 uenza (1·4% 
[0·8–2·4], 10 200 deaths [5700–16 800]) together accounted 
for less than 10% of deaths due to lower respiratory 
infections in children younger than 5 years, and the 
remaining 29% of such deaths in this age group remain 
unattributed.
Expected changes in disease profi
 le with higher SDI
Figure 15 shows the changes in patterns of premature 
mortality as they relate to age-standardised rates of 
YLLs, population age structure, and total YLLs per 
100 000 population. With increasing SDI, age-standard-
ised YLL rates narrowed (fi
 gure 15A), from a total of 
98 742 YLLs per 100 000 for males and 96 381 YLLs 
per 100 000 for females at low SDI, to a low of 9172 YLLs 
per 100 000 and 6239 YLLs per 100 000, respectively, at 
high SDI. The cause composition of YLLs substantially 
shifted as well. At lower SDI, premature mortality 
was largely due to communicable diseases that 
disproportionately aff
 ect children, such as diarrhoeal 
disease and lower respiratory infections, measles, and 
meningitis, but with increasing SDI, YLLs due to these 
causes markedly decreased. Age-standardised YLL rates 
due to HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, neglected tropical 
diseases and malaria, neonatal disorders, and maternal 
disorders also rapidly decreased as SDI increased. 
Nonetheless, the gains achieved for neglected tropical 
diseases and malaria with rising SDI were somewhat 
attenuated because the rates of premature mortality due 
to dengue and Chagas disease increased. For a subset of 
NCDs, several causes had reductions in age-standardised 
YLL rates amid improving SDI, including chronic 
respiratory 
diseases; 
digestive 
diseases; 
diabetes, 
urogenital, 
blood, 
and 
endocrine 
diseases; 
and 
unintentional injuries. However, for other causes, the 
relationship between increasing SDI and premature 
mortality was less obvious. Age-standardised YLL rates 
due to cardiovascular disease gradually increased for 
both sexes until SDI reached 0·40, after which rates 
declined slowly until an SDI of 0·7, and more rapidly 
thereafter. For cancers, age-standardised rates of YLLs 
rose steadily between SDI levels of 0·60 and 0·72, and 
then largely plateaued. Notably, changes in age-
standardised YLL rates and SDI aff
 ected the relative ratio 
of early death by sex for a subset of causes. Cancers, for 
example, began to exact a larger toll for males than 
females at SDI levels of about 0·40; this was mainly 
associated with rising mortality due to lung cancer. 
A similar trend occurred for cardiovascular disease, with 
the age-standardised YLL rates of males exceeding those 
of females beyond an SDI of 0·27
. Injuries generally 
caused higher rates of age-standardised YLLs among 
males than females across all levels of SDI, but the 
largest imbalance occurred between SDI levels of 0·35 
and 0·72.
Increases in SDI had sizeable implications for 
population age structure (fi
 gure 15B), and in combination 
with age-standardised rates of cause-specifi
 c YLLs, these 
factors shape the magnitude—and types—of early deaths 
worldwide (fi
 gure 15C). At the lowest levels of SDI (where 
SDI equals 1), 49·8% of the population was younger than 
15 years and 0·23% was older than 80 years, whereas 
11·3% were younger than 15 years and 9·3% were older 
than 80 years at the highest levels of SDI (where SDI 
equals 100). Diff
 erences by sex with increasing SDI were 
minimal, except for in the oldest age groups starting 
from SDI of 0·40. At highest SDI, the 80 years and older 
age group consisted of far more females (10·9%) than 
males (6·2%). Below an SDI of 0·50, Group 1 causes, 
especially infectious diseases such as diarrhoeal diseases 
and lower respiratory infections, accounted for most 
premature mortality (as much as 72·5%, or roughly 
141 513 YLLs per 100 000). Between SDI levels of 0·32 and 
0·58, premature mortality from communicable causes, 
nutritional defi
 ciencies, and maternal disorders sharply 
decreased, whereas YLLs per 100 000 due to NCDs and 
injuries remained relatively unchanged or slowly 
increased; notably, as SDI increased, early death due to 
neonatal disorders decreased at a much slower pace than 
did other Group 1 causes. At SDI of 0·50 and above, 
NCDs and injuries accounted for a larger portion of total 
YLLs per 100 000 than did communicable, maternal, 
neonatal, 
and 
nutritional 
causes. 
With 
further 
improvements in SDI, YLLs per 100 000 generally 
plateaued—or even increased for some causes—as 
population age structures began to shift faster than the 
falls in age-standardised rates of death. The stark contrast 
between the absolute and relative causes of YLLs 
per 100 000 for SDI levels lower than 0·40 and higher 
than 0·60 accentuates the complex disease profi
 le of the 
remaining levels of SDI: relatively high levels of 
premature mortality due to a broad mixture of causes, 
ranging from neonatal disorders to cardio 
vascular 
disease.
Attribution of change in life expectancy to changes in 
major causes of death
Figure 16 shows changes in life expectancy from 2005 to 
2015, as attributable to changes in Level 2 causes of death, 
for each country, territory, and subnational geography. In 
2015, Andorra had the highest life expectancy at birth for 
males (81·2 years, 95% UI 80·8–81·6) and females 
(88·4 years, 88·1–88·7), whereas Lesotho experienced the 
lowest life expectancy at birth for both sexes (44·1 years, 
38·6–51·8 for males and 50·4 years, 43·6–58·5 for

females). Overall, several countries in sub-Saharan Africa 
had the largest gains in longevity since 2005. By 2015, 
Zimbabwe had the fastest progress for both sexes, with life 
expectancy increasing by 11·7 years (5·5–18·3) to 56·3 years 
(51·1–62·6) for males and 17·0 years (10·1–23·3) to 
62·5 years (56·3–68·3) for females. Furthermore, female 
life expectancy increased by more than 10 years for eight 
countries in sub-Saharan Africa (South Africa, Ethiopia, 
Botswana, Zambia, Swaziland, Namibia, Zimbabwe, and 
Malawi); this progress was largely attributable to marked 
reductions in mortality from HIV
/AIDS. Death rates due to 
HIV
/AIDs peaked from 2003 to 2005 for many of these 
countries, after which sizeable gains in prolonged life 
occurred through to 2015. For some countries, including 
Laos, decreases in death rates from various communicable 
diseases, such as diarrhoeal diseases and lower respiratory 
infections, were related to improved life expectancy, 
whereas several countries in central and eastern Europe

recorded gains in longevity that were mainly associated 
with relative reductions in cardio 
vascular disease deaths.
Nonetheless, seven countries and territories had higher 
life expectancies for both sexes combined (nine for males 
only, four for females only) in 2005 than in 2015 and 
many others had minimal progress due to rising 
numbers of war-related causalities. By 2015, average life 
expectancy for both sexes fell by 1·3 years (−0·3 to 2·8) 
in Libya, 1·1 years (−0·2 to 2·4) in Dominica, and 
7·3 years (1·8–12·1) in Syria; however, these reductions 
were far more pronounced among males in these 
countries, with male life expectancy reduced by 11·3 years 
(3·7–17·4) in Syria, 2·5 years (0·2–4·9) in Libya, and 
1·6 years (−0·3 to 3·6) in Dominica. For Syria and Libya, 
rising mortality due to war was the main driver of such 
losses in longevity, whereas NCDs, including cancers 
and cardiovascular disease, led to reduced male life 
expectancy in Dominica. Six other geographies also had 
decreases in male life expectancy since 2005, with losses 
of 0·9 years (−0·6 to 2·5) in Jamaica, 1·6 years 
(−1·2 to 4·2) in Guam, 0·5 years (−2·4 to 3·2) in 
Palestine, 0·4 years (–1·3 to 2·0) in the Northern Mariana 
Islands, 0·6 years (−0·7 to 2·0) in the Virgin Islands, and 
0·5 years (−1·2 to 2·1) in Venezuela. Increased mortality 
from cancers, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and 
chronic kidney disease was associated with reduced life 
expectancy among males in Jamaica and Guam, whereas 
increased death rates due to interpersonal violence 
largely contributed to reduced longevity for males in 
Venezuela. For several countries and territories, overall 
life expectancy increased from 2005 to 2015, but 
heightened

deaths resulted in reductions in life expectancy of 
1·5 years for males and 1·0 years for females, attenuating 
further improvement in life expectancy. Similar results 
emerged for other countries in which war has claimed 
increasingly more lives, including Afghanistan, Iraq, 
Somalia, and South Sudan. The 2015 earthquake in Nepal 
largely contributed to the 0·7 years lost for females and 
0·8 years for males; nonetheless, overall life expectancy 
improved by 2·1 years (−0·4 to 4·6) and 2·4 years 
(0·0–4·6) for males and females in Nepal, respectively—
gains mainly attributable to reductions in mortality from 
diarrhoeal diseases and lower respiratory infections.
Inequalities in life expectancy by sex generally 
increased over time. In 2005, the diff
 erence between 
male and female life expectancy was 5·0 years (65·7 years, 
95% UI 65·5–65·9 for males and 70·7 years, 70·5–71·0 
for females), which widened to 5·8 years in 2015 
(69·0 years, 68·3–69·4 for males and 74·8 years, 
74·4–75·2 for females). For several countries, including 
Russia, Estonia, and Latvia, diff
 erences between male 
and female life expectancy narrowed more rapidly; these 
gains could be attributed to reduced mortality due to 
cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and injuries. Yet, 
inequalities in life expectancy grew in many countries 
and territories, often driven by uneven progress in health 
by sex and increasing male deaths due to a subset of 
NCDs. For example, Georgia recorded a widening gap 
between male and female life expectancy, rising from 
8·6 years (7·7–9·6) in 2005 to 10·2 years (8·9–11·4) in 
2015. In other places (eg, Syria), rising mortality from 
interpersonal violence or war disproportionately aff
 ected 
males.
Leading causes of YLLs and deviations from expected 
levels based on SDI
Distinct, yet notably varied, patterns emerged across and 
within GBD regions when we compared observed YLLs 
due to leading causes with the levels of premature 
mortality expected on the basis of SDI. Figure 17 shows 
the ratios of observed and expected YLLs for the 
ten leading causes by geography in 2015, colour coded by 
the magnitude of diff
 erences between observed and 
expected YLLs. 
Globally, ischaemic heart disease and stroke were the 
leading two causes of premature mortality in 2015; 
119 countries and territories also had ischaemic heart 
disease or stroke as the leading cause of YLLs that year. 
Three geographical regions featured countries that 
largely diverged from this trend: Latin America and the 
Caribbean, where interpersonal violence or lower 
respiratory infections frequently accounted for the most 
YLLs; north Africa and the Middle East, where war was 
the primary cause of early death in several countries; 
and sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV/AIDS or malaria 
was the leading cause of YLLs in 28 countries. 
Furthermore, lung cancer consistently ranked among 
the top three causes of YLLs in high-income countries; 
road injuries were a major cause of early death in Latin 
American countries; and neonatal disorders were 
frequently among leading fi
 ve causes of YLLs in south 
Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
Of the ten leading causes of premature mortality 
globally, lower respiratory infections resulted in the 
most countries (122) recording observed YLLs lower 
than those expected on the basis of SDI. This fi
 nding 
was particularly prevalent in east Asia, where China and 
North Korea had YLL ratios less than 0·40. Other leading 
causes for which observed YLLs were much lower than 
expected included stroke in Andean Latin America and 
neonatal preterm birth complications in Oceania. By 
contrast, HIV/AIDS led to the highest discrepancies for 
observed and expected YLLs, particularly aff
 ecting 
southern sub-Saharan Africa. Diarrhoeal diseases, 
particularly in southern sub-Saharan Africa, and 
neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and 
trauma, particularly in southern Asia, also resulted in 
large diff
 erences for observed and expected YLLs.
Regional, country, territory, and selected subnational 
results
For many high-income countries, observed YLLs due to 
stroke—a cause consistently among the leading three 
causes of early death—fell below the levels expected on 
the basis of SDI in 2015. Spain, France, Malta, and Israel 
had particularly low ratios for observed versus expected 
YLLs from stroke, all falling below 0·45; 26 countries, 
including Portugal, Argentina, and Uruguay had ratios 
lower than 0·80. A subset of countries, including Japan, 
South Korea, and Chile, also had lower observed YLLs 
from ischaemic heart disease than expected on the basis 
of SDI. Early death due to drug use disorders exceeded 
expected levels in the USA (5·71), Scotland (5·08), and 
Norway (3·44), and a similar pattern was found for YLLs 
due to alcohol use disorders in Denmark (10·50) and 
Finland (9·61). Within the GBD high-income super-
region, Brunei, Greenland, and the USA had some of the 
largest deviations between observed and expected YLLs 
across causes. Within the UK, observed YLLs from self-
harm and stroke were often substantially lower than 
expected for most regions, whereas observed levels of 
premature mortality due to COPD were higher than 
expected.
Throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, 
observed YLLs due to interpersonal violence far exceeded 
those expected on the basis of SDI, with 19 countries 
and territories recording ratios higher than 3·00. 
Furthermore, interpersonal violence ranked as the fi
 rst 
or second leading cause of early death for seven of 
11 countries in central and Tropical Latin America. For 
these two geographical regions, discrepancies between 
observed and expected YLLs from interpersonal violence 
were highest in Venezuela (9·91) and Brazil (4·88), 
respectively. Observed YLLs were also higher than 
expected for diabetes, especially in the Caribbean;

Figure 16: Attribution of changes in life expectancy at birth to changes in major groups of causes of death, 2005 to 2015
Changes are shown for countries and territories (and subnational units in the UK) for females (A) and males (B). Locations are ordered by decreasing life expectancy at birth in 2015. Blue lines show life 
expectancy at birth in 2005 and black lines show life expectancy at birth in 2015. Causes to the left of the 2005 life expectancy values refl
 ect causes that contributed to reductions in life expectancy 
from 2005 to 2015. Causes to the right of the 2005 life expectancy values contributed to increases in life expectancy from 2005 to 2015.

chronic kidney disease, particularly in Mexico (3·22); 
and prostate cancer for several Caribbean islands and 
territories. Although ischaemic heart disease was a 
leading cause of early death for many Latin American 
countries, several had ratios of observed and expected 
YLLs lower than 0·60, including Peru (0·33), Panama 
(0·50), and Colombia (0·51). Similar results were found 
for stroke (eg, a ratio of 0·26 for Costa Rica); road injuries 
(eg, Honduras [0·37] and Cuba [0·48]); and for preterm 
birth complications (Haiti [0·43] and Guatemala [0·32]).
In 2015, leading causes of early death, as well as 
their observed and expected levels, were markedly 
heterogeneous in southeast and east Asia and Oceania. 
For many countries and territories, lower respiratory 
infections ranked among the ten leading causes of 
premature mortality, but observed YLLs fell below the 
levels expected on the basis of SDI (eg, 0·22 in the 
Maldives, 0·34 in China, and 0·46 in the Solomon 
Islands). For others, such as Malaysia and Laos, observed 
YLLs due to lower respiratory infections were higher than 
expected. Within the region, 18 countries and territories 
had ischaemic heart disease as their leading cause of 
YLLs in 2015, but their ratios of observed versus expected 
YLLs ranged from less than 0·50 in Thailand to more 
than 4·00 in Guam. Particularly in Oceania, observed 
levels of YLLs due to diabetes and chronic kidney disease 
consistently exceeded expected YLLs, and premature 
mortality due to liver cancer was higher than expected in 
Taiwan (province of China), Thailand, China, North 
Korea, Vietnam, and Tonga. Observed YLLs due to 
communicable diseases were at least twice as high as 
expected for some countries, including measles in Papua 
New Guinea (3·61) and tuberculosis in Indonesia (6·53) 
and the Philippines (4·11). At the same time, several 
countries and territories recorded cause-specifi
 c YLLs 
that were substantially lower than expected, such as 
preterm birth complications in Papua New Guinea (0·35); 
road injuries in Sri Lanka (0·47) and Samoa (0·31); and 
self-harm in Malaysia (0·52) and China (0·51).
Patterns of early death in south Asia refl
 ect the region’s 
diversity of countries and their relative stages of 
development. Although lower respiratory infections, 
diarrhoeal diseases, and congenital anomalies remained 
among the leading causes of premature mortality 
throughout south Asia, observed levels of YLLs were 
generally lower than those expected on the basis of SDI. 
However, for most countries in south Asia, observed 
YLLs due to neonatal encephalopathy were more than 
twice as high as expected (eg, 2·94 in Pakistan and 
2·13 in India). Notably, observed YLLs from intestinal 
infections, such as typhoid fever, were above expected 
levels in Bangladesh (6·07). Observed levels of YLLs 
exceeded expected levels for a subset of NCDs, including 
ischaemic heart disease in Pakistan (1·81), and COPD in 
India (2·44). In 2015, an earthquake claimed more than 
8700 lives in Nepal, and since the occurrence of 
earthquakes has minimal linkages to SDI, the ratio for 
observed and expected YLLs was extremely high for 
natural disasters. At the same time, Nepal and Bangladesh 
had substantially fewer than expected YLLs due to 
preterm birth complications (0·25 and 0·40, respectively). 
Observed levels of early death from stroke were also 
lower than expected in Bhutan (0·49) and Nepal (0·49).
In central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia, 
except for a subset of causes and countries, observed 
YLLs generally met or exceeded the levels expected on 
the basis of SDI. YLL ratios due to ischaemic heart 
disease and hypertensive heart disease were more 
than 2·00 for 17 countries, and observed premature 
mortality due to cardiomyopathy and myocarditis was at 
least three times higher than expected levels in Russia 
(10·86), Latvia (7·93), and Bosnia and Herzegovina 
(5·65). Alcohol and drug use disorders were among the 
ten leading causes of early death throughout the region, 
and observed levels often exceeded expected YLLs (eg, 
24·53 for drug use disorders in the Ukraine and 17·95 for 
alcohol use disorders in Russia). Early death from 
cirrhosis due to alcohol use was more common than 
expected in several countries, including Moldova (4·24) 
and Hungary (3·40), whereas levels of YLLs due to 
interpersonal violence far exceeded expected levels in 
Russia (12·78) and Kazakhstan (5·65). Group 1 causes 
often led to higher levels of observed YLLs than expected 
in central Asia, such as neonatal encephalopathy in 
Azerbaijan (8·26) and lower respiratory infections in 
Turkmenistan (6·81). Notably, several countries had 
much lower than expected observed YLLs due to road 
injuries, including Albania (0·38) and Macedonia (0·47).
In north Africa and the Middle East, large discrepancies 
occurred between observed YLLs and those expected on 
the basis of SDI, underscoring the region’s rapid 
development and inequalities in wealth. Furthermore, 
because of the region’s escalating rates of war-related 
mortality, which is not strictly related to SDI, ratios of 
observed versus expected YLLs from war were extremely 
high. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Afghanistan 
had the most causes for which observed levels of YLLs 
exceeded expected YLLs; these causes ranged from 
ischaemic heart disease to interpersonal violence for 
Afghanistan, and included chronic kidney disease, COPD, 
diabetes, and road injuries for the UAE. Many countries 
in the region recorded substantially lower YLLs than 
expected for several causes: 13 had ratios less than 0·60 
for lower respiratory infections, including Iraq (0·40) and 
Palestine (0·25); eight countries had ratios less than 0·60 
for stroke, including Lebanon (0·45) and Turkey (0·42); 
and six had ratios less than 0·60 for preterm birth 
complications, including Egypt (0·47) and Syria (0·19).
For every country in sub-Saharan Africa, the leading 
cause of early death was one of four communicable 
diseases—HIV
/AIDS, 
malaria, 
lower 
respiratory 
infection, or diarrhoeal diseases—yet patterns in 
observed and expected levels of YLLs strikingly diff
 ered 
within the continent. In southern sub-Saharan Africa,

HIV
/AIDS was the leading cause of premature mortality 
and resulted in exceedingly more YLLs than expected 
given SDI; Namibia, with a YLL ratio for HIV
/AIDS 
of 7·97, was the lowest among these countries, whereas 
Swaziland had the highest ratio (19·98). Early death due 
to tuberculosis also surpassed expected levels, especially 
in South Africa (19·05), as did observed YLLs due to 
violence (eg, 7·41 in South Africa). Observed YLLs due to 
preterm birth complications were somewhat lower than 
expected in southern sub-Saharan Africa (eg, 0·58 in 
Botswana), but such levels were largely surpassed by 
countries in western and eastern sub-Saharan Africa. In 
2015, 13 countries in western sub-Saharan Africa and 
14 countries in eastern sub-Saharan Africa had YLL ratios 
lower than 0·60 for preterm birth complications. 
In western sub-Saharan Africa, observed premature 
mortality due to malaria was at least twice as high as 
expected in 13 of 19 countries in the region, with the 
highest YLL ratios in Nigeria (108·21) and Ghana (78·2). 
Neonatal sepsis caused more YLLs than expected based 
on SDI in several western sub-Saharan African countries, 
including Ghana (5·51). Despite the fact that the Ebola 
virus disease epidemic claimed more lives in 2014 than 
in 2015, Ebola virus disease remained among the leading 
cause of YLLs in Sierra Leone and Liberia. Although still 
among the leading causes of early death in western 
sub-Saharan Africa, YLLs due to lower respiratory 
infections and diarrhoeal diseases were much lower than 
expected for most countries, with YLL ratios as low as 
0·29 in Mali and 0·28 in The Gambia, respectively. 
Similar trends emerged for eastern sub-Saharan Africa, 
although the toll of HIV
/AIDS was generally higher; 
observed levels of premature mortality due to HIV/AIDS 
were at least fi
 ve times higher than expected in Zambia 
(6·21) and Mozambique (7·75). Within eastern sub-
Saharan Africa, eight of 15 countries had YLL ratios less 
than 0·60 for YLLs due to diarrhoeal diseases (eg, 
Rwanda [0·40] and Uganda [0·47]), emphasising the 
region’s rising SDI. Furthermore, every country in 
eastern sub-Saharan Africa had observed YLLs due to 
preterm birth complications that were below expected 
levels, including Ethiopia (0·36) and Kenya (0·46). 
Nonetheless, YLL ratios for malaria were quite high for 
several countries, particularly Zambia (41·28) and 
Tanzania (11·54). Among countries in central sub-
Saharan Africa, malaria resulted in many more YLLs 
than expected based on SDI, with Angola, Congo 
(Brazzaville), Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon reporting

ratios that exceeded 20·00. Neonatal sepsis consistently 
caused more early deaths than expected within the 
region. Observed YLLs due to preterm birth complications 
fell below expected levels in Angola (0·39), Congo 
(Brazzaville; 0·43), and the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo (0·47). Notably, the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, which had the world’s sixth-highest death toll due 
to diarrhoeal diseases in 2015, had far fewer YLLs due to 
diarrhoea than expected (0·27).
Discussion
Main fi
 ndings
Over the past 35 years, global life expectancy, age-
standardised death rates, and age-standardised YLL rates 
have all substantially improved year on year, with the 
single exception of 1994 (high mortality from the 
Rwandan genocide, the Iraq civil war, and ongoing 
armed confl
 ict in Bosnia and Herzegovina that year was 
enough to change the trend in global life expectancy). 
During 2005–15, life expectancy increased in 188 of 
195 countries and territories and those increases were 
faster than expected on the basis of SDI improvements 
in 120 countries and territories. Such gains were mainly 
driven by marked reductions in mortality due to HIV
/
AIDS, malaria, infectious diseases such as lower 
respiratory infections and diarrhoea, neonatal disorders, 
cardiovascular disease, and cancers. Running counter to 
the general improvement, age-standardised death rates 
for 13 causes increased signifi
 cantly in the past decade. 
In addition to these causes with increases, for some 
leading causes of death such as diabetes and chronic 
kidney disease, age-standardised death rates have 
stagnated globally and increased in some countries. 
Since 2011, global deaths from war have risen massively 
due to confl
 icts in Syria, Yemen, and Libya. Furthermore, 
gains in life expectancy were reversed for a subset of 
countries, with Syrian men bearing the largest toll (a 
12·1 year reduction in life expectancy from 2010 to 2015).
Our analysis of the average relationships between age, 
sex, and cause-specifi
 c mortality and SDI suggest that 
the epidemiological transition does not aff
 ect all causes 
uniformly. Not all causes of death or YLLs improve 
as SDI increases. In fact, some causes such as 
cardiovascular disease and a subset of cancer types, 
initially tend to increase with rising SDI and then decline. 
This inverted U pattern might be related to changes in 
risk factors that initially increase disease incidence and 
then, with rising SDI, risk factor management and 
disease treatment might act to reduce age-specifi
 c 
mortality. The change in death numbers and population 
rates with the epidemiological transition was driven by 
both expected changes in age-specifi
 c rates and the 
highly regular shifts in population age structure that 
occur with rising SDI. Previous attempts to characterise 
the shifts in disease pattern with development56–58 have 
not been as comprehensive and have not been based on a 
comprehensive database such as that provided by GBD.
Across causes and within geographical regions, we found 
huge country-level heterogeneities when observed levels 
of premature mortality were compared with those 
expected on the basis of SDI. The average patterns of age-
specifi
 c mortality associated with a given level of SDI are 
a useful starting point for benchmarking a country’s 
mortality pattern, but many other factors, including 
public health programmes, access to medical care, and 
inequalities could account for deviations from the pattern 
expected on the basis of SDI alone.
Nearly 40 years ago, Samuel Preston observed a shifting 
relationship between life expectancy and income per 
capita;58 in a series of subsequent analyses, the crucial 
role of technological change has been supported by this 
changing relationship.58–61 With global life expectancy or 
other mortality metrics improving faster than expected 
on the basis of SDI, this general trend was tempered by 
stagnant or increasing mortality rates due to a subset of 
causes such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and 
some types of cancer. The overall shift in life expectancy 
masked larger gains for children and minimal progress 
for older adults compared with that expected on the basis 
of SDI. In fact, fi
 gures 10C and 10D show that global 
progress has been much less impressive for the 
probability of death from ages 15–50 years than for 
children and that progress in reducing the probability of 
death from ages 50–70 years only seems to be noticeable 
at high levels of SDI. In the younger adult age groups, 
temporal patterns over the past 25 years were profoundly 
shaped by the unfolding of the HIV epidemic in eastern 
and southern sub-Saharan Africa and roll-out of ART 
and PMTCT and the rise and subsequent fall in adult 
mortality in eastern Europe and central Asia. This is an 
important diff
 erence from previous notions of the 
inevitability of technological shifts driving up levels of 
health faster than expected on the basis of income and 
education alone.58–62 This fi
 nding comes at a time when 
two very diff
 erent views of the future of health can be 
envisioned: rising threats such as climate change, food 
insecurity, water shortages, pandemics, human security, 
continued increases in obesity, or antimicrobial 
resistance that could undermine past health gains; and 
the realisation of the huge potential of new medical and 
public health breakthroughs driven by genomics, 
nanotechnology, and other technical developments.63–68 
Future health scenario construction will crucially depend 
on how the balance of these forces is played out.
The analysis of trends in numbers of global deaths by 
cause broken down into changes due to population 
growth, population ageing, and changes in age-
standardised 
death 
rates 
highlights 
the 
critical 
importance of ageing in changing the mixture of causes 
of death and disease that health systems will have to 
manage. Likewise, the marked diff
 erence in patterns 
between age-standardised rates to crude rates of YLLs 
shows how ageing amplifi

communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional

diseases to NCDs. The combination of demographic and 
epidemiological change can also lead to extremely rapid 
changes in disease profi
 les in some countries. China is a 
clear example of having an accelerated change in disease 
profi
 les: from 1990 to 2015, the percentage of YLLs due to 
NCDs increased from 50·0% (48·5–53·0) to 77·3% 
(76·5–78·1). The potential rapidity of these changes 
presents challenges to many ministries of health in 
terms of human resources for health planning and policy 
formulation. Understanding where this potential is 
about to unfold will be aided by systematic demographic 
and epidemiological forecasts grounded in the patterns 
recorded in GBD.
Communicable diseases
Although our methods for the assessment of HIV
/AIDS 
mortality changed substantially from GBD 2013, our 
general fi
 ndings at the global level have remained similar 
across iterations of GBD.11 With the global epidemic of 
HIV
/AIDS mortality peaking in 2005, at 1·8 million 
deaths (95% UI 1·7 million to 1·9 million), deaths due to 
HIV
/AIDS had decreased by 2015, dropping to 1·2 million 
(1·1 million to 1·3 million). Yet despite major progress, 
especially amid the scale-up of ART and PMTCT in 
sub-Saharan Africa, HIV
/AIDS remains the leading 
cause of YLLs in 16 countries and among top fi
 ve causes 
of mortality in 38 countries. Large numbers of individuals 
continue to die from HIV
/AIDS each year in eastern and 
southern sub-Saharan Africa, where many countries still 
experience large-scale epidemics, even with the rapid 
scale-up of ART. We estimate that 17·8% (13·6–20·6) of 
these HIV
/AIDS deaths in 2015 were due to tuberculosis 
in HIV-positive people, but little data exist for the 
immediate causes of other HIV
/AIDS deaths. Continued 
high death rates in sub-Saharan Africa highlight the 
critical importance of improved quality of care and early 
initiation of therapy, irrespective of disease progression.69 
In the face of calls for the end of HIV
/AIDS by 2030, 
more rapid progress is urgently needed.70–73 Stagnating 
development assistance for health for HIV
/AIDS 
programmes amplifi
 es the challenge of reducing 
HIV
/AIDS mortality.74,75
Our results suggest a notable decrease in malaria 
mortality in sub-Saharan Africa since 2003, consistent 
with 
documented 
reductions 
in 
incidence 
and 
prevalence, as well as observed increases in eff
 ective 
treatment and preventive interventions.76 We found that 
malaria mortality peaked in 2003, which is slightly 
earlier than reported in previous GBD estimates. 
However, the timing of peak malaria mortality varied 
across countries (eg, 2005 in Angola and 2000 in 
Uganda), which might refl
 ect a combination of factors. 
Estimates presented here for sub-Saharan Africa are 
based on an estimation method that maps from all 
untreated cases to mortality and will be refi
 ned in further 
iterations of GBD (eg, the introduction of an intermediate 
step of severe malaria).
The population attributable fraction of diarrhoeal 
aetiologies increased for most aetiologies compared with 
GBD 2013. This is mainly because of two factors. First, 
we used the new TAC diagnostic for the detection of 
pathogens in GEMS compared with the conventional 
laboratory diagnostic methods used in GBD 2013. The 
TAC method is more sensitive and specifi
 c than the 
conventional methods, such as bacterial culture or 
ELISA, which tends to increase the odds ratios used in 
the attributable fraction estimation by correcting for 
the pathogen misclassifi
 cation.77,78 Second, we used a 
correction factor to adjust for false negatives and false 
positives of the prevalence of pathogens in patients with 
diarrhoea and to make it comparable with the odds ratios 
from the TAC diagnostic method. We corrected our 
modelled prevalence estimates for the imperfect 
sensitivity and specifi
 city of the laboratory diagnostic 
results compared with TAC because most studies 
reported diarrhoea based on previous diagnostics. 
Therefore, the correction for the prevalence of the 
pathogens widened our uncertainty of the fi
 nal estimates. 
Although qPCR is a well established diagnostic for 
diarrhoeal pathogens, the application of TAC remains a 
novel approach and further testing of the appropriate 
cutoff
 s for continuous measures of pathogen presence is 
needed.
The attributable fractions for Aeromonas, amoebiasis 
(Entamoeba histolytica), and H infl
 uenzae type b were not 
signifi
 cant in children younger than 5 years at the global 
level. Indeed, this is biologically implausible given that 
these pathogens do not have a protective eff
 ect against 
mortality. The odds ratios of diarrhoea given the presence 
of Aeromonas and amoebiasis were not signifi
 cant in 
children aged 0–1 years and 1–2 years but were signifi
 cant 
in the 2–5-year age group, highlighting that these 
pathogens might not be signifi
 cant contributors across 
all age groups. The attributable fraction for H infl
 uenzae 
type b is based on a meta-analysis of randomised 
controlled trials of vaccine effi
  cacy where the CI of the 
pooled estimate was not statistically signifi
 cant. This is a 
potential limitation and future analyses could use 
alternative meta-analytical methods, such as log-log 
meta-analysis or imposition of a non-negative population 
attributable fraction prior, to prevent negative population 
attributable fraction estimates.
Our estimation of the fraction of deaths due to lower 
respiratory infection attributable to pneumococcal 
pneumonia relies on data from vaccine effi
  cacy studies 
that show a decrease in all pneumonia and among 
invasive (bacteraemic) pneumococcal disease in children 
and adults. However, at least one study that used a urine 
antigen test in elderly adults found that the relative 
vaccine effi
  cacy of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 
against invasive pneumococcal disease was 66% greater 
than against pneumococcal pneumonia.49 For GBD 2015, 
we corrected the estimated pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine  effi
  cacy against invasive pneumococcal disease

1523
by this ratio in both child and adult age groups. This is a 
change in our GBD 2015 methods, although no studies 
have used this diagnostic test to detect non-invasive 
pneumococcal pneumonia in children. To refl
 ect the 
uncertainty of this adjustment, we used a uniform 
distribution around the point estimate of the ratio. This 
adjustment contributed to an increase in our estimates of 
pneumococcal pneumonia mortality because the vaccine 
effi
  cacy against pneumococcal pneumonia could be 
lower than has previously been estimated.49 Given the 
much larger attributable fraction after the adjustment 
was made and wide uncertainty of the fi
 nal estimates, 
further studies to confi
 rm and precisely quantify the 
diff
 erence in vaccine effi
  cacy between invasive and non-
invasive disease are needed. Data availability limitations, 
particularly for vaccine effi
  cacy data across age groups, 
hindered our ability to conduct pathogen attribution 
analyses for H infl
 uenzae type b among populations aged 
5 years and older; a similar lack of data made estimating 
population attributable fractions and pathogen-specifi
 c 
mortality for neonates analytically infeasible.
While mortality rates from most infectious diseases 
fell, dengue emerged as a notable counterexample. The 
combination of new data and an improved dengue trend 
covariate (methods appendix p 82) enabled our model to 
better capture these trends. Compared with GBD 2013 
estimates, our GBD 2015 dengue mortality estimates are 
higher for the most recent decade, yielding a pronounced 
upward trend that is more consistent with case reports, 
GBD 2013 incidence estimates, and expert consensus.79 
The increasing geographic range of dengue and, in some 
areas (eg, Latin America) increasing transmission 
intensity, contribute to growing concerns about other 
viruses that are transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, 
including the chikungunya and Zika viruses.80 Progress 
in dengue vaccine development, including the licensure 
of the CYD-TDV vaccine in 2015,81 is promising, but the 
eventual impact of such vaccines remains unclear.
In GBD we follow the ICD principles of underlying 
cause of death. According to this principle, a single 
underlying cause is assigned to each death. In some 
cases, somewhat arbitrary rules are used to deal with 
interactions between pathogens or disease processes—
eg, all deaths from opportunistic infections, such as 
fungal infections, in HIV-positive patients are assigned 
to HIV/AIDS as the underlying cause. Underlying cause 
assignment is distinct from the notion of excess mortality, 
whereby a condition or disease can be associated with 
increased risk of death from other pathophysiological 
processes. In some cases, the underlying cause of death 
rules embedded in the ICD could lead to lower death 
estimates for some neglected tropical diseases. For 
example, anaemia is a sequela of various diff
 erent 
conditions, some of which are parasitic. Hookworm 
infections can cause iron-defi
 ciency anaemia,82 which is 
then recorded as the underlying cause of death. Similarly, 
infections by Clonorchis spp have been associated with 
increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma83 and are classifi
 ed 
as a Group 1 carcinogen by the International Agency for 
Research on Cancer (IARC);84 however, the cause of death 
will be listed as cholangiocarcinoma and will be captured 
within the total cancer estimates. Alternative post-hoc 
analyses might be useful for some of these neglected 
tropical diseases to characterise the excess mortality that 
could be related to the disease.
Pandemics were incorporated into GBD as fatal 
discontinuities in the same way as armed confl
 icts and 
natural disasters.7,85 In late 2013 an epidemic of Ebola 
virus disease started in west Africa. Slow national and 
international responses allowed the virus to spread 
throughout 2014 and to become a Public Health 
Emergency of International Concern,86 which was 
eventually brought under control in 2015 after a sustained 
multilateral eff
 ort. These estimates of mortality are of the 
direct deaths attributable to Ebola virus disease and do 
not account for the full eff
 ects of mechanisms such as 
the breakdown of health systems or critical infrastructure 
and their subsequent potential health repercussions.87,88 
Previous estimates of mortality86 combined with these 
destabilising eff
 ects on wider health-care provisioning 
within the three most aff
 ected countries have already 
resulted in appropriate introspection among the 
international community on the ability of institutions to 
cope with pandemic threats.89 Correctly establishing 
the relative public health importance of pandemic 
preparedness investments is non-trivial, because even if 
there are no deaths in a year from a potential pandemic 
cause, such as pandemic infl
 uenza, substantial excess 
mortality risk remains.90 The need for better surveillance 
and preparedness infrastructures to help to mitigate the 
risk posed by potential pandemic infectious diseases has 
been strongly advocated91 and has been underscored 
again in 2016 with the rapid spread of Zika virus across 
the Americas and the declaration of another Public 
Health Emergency of International Concern.92
In GBD 2015, we have not estimated the burden of 
drug-resistant tuberculosis as a cause distinct from 
overall tuberculosis. Nor have we estimated deaths 
related to drug-resistant bacteria or malaria. The 
challenge that antimicrobial resistance poses both to 
current and future health-care systems is becoming 
increasingly documented and quantifi
 ed,93 with an 
estimated 3·3% of new tuberculosis cases and 20% of 
previously treated cases having multidrug resistance.94 
Incorporating the proportion of cases caused by 
pathogens with drug resistance therefore represents a 
signifi
 cant, but increasingly important, objective for 
future estimates.95 Within the GBD framework, drug 
resistance might be best assessed by examining 
antimicrobial resistance as a risk factor rather than 
estimation of subtypes of each pathogen.
Researchers have long foreseen health eff
 ects caused by 
changes in the environment, with a particular focus on 
climate change.96 To date, our results do not show these

trends being realised. Instead they show a substantial 
global trend of improvement in SDI and notable 
improvements in many of the infectious disease causes 
that would be most sensitive to climate change such as 
malaria,76 in a process known as the environmentalist’s 
paradox.97 This lack of any association so far could be 
related to time lags between global environmental change 
and health outcomes and is widely hypothesised to be at 
the expense of degradation of ecosystem services.98 
It might also simply be much harder to detect changes 
against the backdrop of rapid improvements that are 
expected with SDI. The value expected from SDI might 
therefore help to identify which countries or subnational 
areas are improving at rates that are slower than expected.
Non-communicable diseases
From 2005 to 2015 age-standardised death rates due to 
most types of cancer decreased, a refl
 ection of risk factor 
reduction, as well as improvements in some settings of 
health systems equipped for early diagnosis and eff
 ective 
treatment of cancers. With respect to YLLs due to cancer, 
lung cancer remains the leading cause globally and for 
most countries, with YLLs increasing by almost 15% 
over the past decade. Given that most cases of lung 
cancer can be prevented,99 this observation stresses the 
importance of tobacco and air pollution control. For 
other types of cancer, the geographic pattern is more 
diverse and refl
 ects the vast diff
 erences in risk factors, as 
well as health system capacity. Whereas colorectal, 
breast, and pancreatic cancer are the leading causes of 
cancer YLLs for most high-income countries, stomach, 
liver, and oesophageal cancer dominate in countries 
with low SDI. It is encouraging that global YLLs due to 
stomach cancer have decreased over the past decade, 
with the substantial decrease in age-specifi
 c death rates 
counterbalancing population growth and ageing. 
Oesophageal cancer is the other example for which YLLs 
decreased from 2005 to 2015, with the decrease in age-
specifi
 c death rates off
 setting the increase due to an 
ageing and growing population. Translating the observed 
changes in liver cancer mortality into public health 
planning and policy requires knowledge of the 
underlying aetiologies, as risk factors diff
 er substantially 
between locations. This has become an even higher 
priority now that eff
 ective treatment for hepatitis C is 
available.100 The increase in numbers of liver cancer 
deaths due to hepatitis B from 2005 to 2015 was not 
signifi
 cant, which contrasted with the signifi
 cant 
increases in deaths, often 20–30%, observed for many 
other types of cancer: this relative progress might be at 
least partly attributable to hepatitis B vaccination. 
A similar development for liver cancer due to hepatitis C 
can be achieved in the coming decades if hepatitis C 
treatment, which currently has high costs per patient,100 
becomes accessible in high prevalence populations.
Data newly available to GBD 2015 improved our 
understanding of global patterns of cardiovascular 
disease. High proportions of death due to cardiovascular 
disease have been observed in Oceania. Previously, very 
few data sources were available from Kiribati and Fiji,101 
but with additional data from Tonga, Guam, American 
Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands, it seems that 
27–30% of deaths in this region were due to cardiovascular 
disease causes. Newly available data from India show 
that, similar to surveillance data previously available 
from Bangladesh, cardiovascular disease accounts for a 
large and increasing proportion of deaths. Updated data 
from China now show a clear trend toward decreasing 
risk of cardiovascular disease death in all age groups 
since 2010, when comprehensive vital registration 
became available. In GBD 2015 we examined age-
standardised YLL rates by level of SDI. YLL rates for 
ischaemic heart disease were lowest in countries with the 
lowest SDI when country populations were examined by 
SDI, rising steadily at higher levels of SDI, and only 
reduced for populations in the quarter of countries with 
the highest SDI. This pattern was more pronounced 
among males than females and diff
 ers from that seen for 
stroke, where YLL rates decrease gradually at higher 
levels of SDI and then fall steeply for the highest SDI 
populations. The result is that for overall cardiovascular 
disease, YLL rates were lowest in both the lowest and 
highest sociodemographic groups with an increase for 
those in the middle of the sociodemographic rankings. 
One hypothesis is that medical care in the highest SDI 
populations might have increased life expectancy to the 
point where cardiovascular disease is most prevalent, 
while people in the lowest sociodemographic group are 
dying from other conditions before reaching an age 
where they would develop ischaemic heart disease and 
stroke.102 In this scenario, people living in countries 
categorised in the middle range of the sociodemographic 
rankings are surviving long enough to develop ischaemic 
heart disease but might not have access to optimal 
medical or surgical treatment.
Deaths due to cirrhosis increased globally from 2005 to 
2015, whereas age-standardised cirrhosis mortality rates 
fell during the same period. Underlying the global picture, 
though, are notably distinct regional trends, with 
substantial reductions in cirrhosis mortality in east Asia 
and central Europe, for example, and increases in cirrhosis 
mortality in central Asia and north Africa and the Middle 
East. These trends largely refl
 ect changes in the major risk 
factors for the disease, with some cirrhosis risk factors, 
such as chronic hepatitis B infection, decreasing in the 
face of widespread vaccination, and other risk factors, such 
as alcohol consumption and chronic hepatitis C, increasing 
in some parts of the world.103 The decades-long lag between 
hepatitis B infection and cirrhosis death, and the increasing 
use of the hepatitis B vaccine, suggest that the potential 
eff
 ect of vaccination on cirrhosis mortality is only 
beginning to become apparent, and hepatitis B-attributable 
cirrhosis deaths should continue to fall. Notably, with 
nearly a quarter of cirrhosis deaths being due to chronic

1525
hepatitis C infection, improvements in blood screening 
and new short-course oral treatments for hepatitis C have 
the potential to reduce cirrhosis mortality in the future.103,104
Globally, total deaths from Alzheimer’s disease and 
other dementias increased by almost 40% from 2005 to 
2015. This increase is due to population increases and 
ageing accompanied by a small but signifi
 cant decrease 
in age-standardised death rates from Alzheimer’s disease 
and other dementias, possibly refl
 ecting the reduced 
burden of cardiovascular disease and the contribution of 
vascular brain injury to the dementia syndrome.105 
A small reduction in mortality rates is consistent with 
reports of a fall in the prevalence of dementia from two 
cross-sectional surveys a decade apart in the UK and a 
decline in incidence of dementia reported from the 
Framingham Cohort Study in the USA.106,107 There is also 
evidence that increased education and healthier lifestyles 
can reduce disease incidence and delay disease 
onset,105,107,108 partly refl
 ecting the reduced burden of 
cardiovascular disease and the contribution of vascular 
brain injury to the dementia syndrome. Although the 
reductions in rates are welcome news, the substantial 
increase in the number of deaths from Alzheimer’s 
disease and other dementias and the associated increase 
in prevalence present challenges for health systems and 
social support systems that need to address the needs of 
these patients and their families.
We estimate small numbers of death due to mental 
disorders as the underlying cause. We include 
schizophrenia as a cause of death because high-quality 
vital registration data every year show a stable, small 
number of deaths from this cause. Many more deaths 
occur in people with schizophrenia in excess of what 
would be expected on the basis of general population 
mortality rates. These deaths are certifi
 ed and coded to 
other diseases and injuries as the underlying cause, such 
as self-harm, unintentional injuries, infectious diseases, 
substance use, cardiovascular disease, and cancers, for 
which excess mortality in people with schizophrenia has 
been reported.109–111 Most deaths from self-harm can be 
attributed to underlying mental and substance disorders 
such as depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, 
bipolar disorder, and alcohol and drug use disorders, as 
has been quantifi
 ed based on GBD 2010 estimates.112 
In future iterations of GBD, it might be useful to more 
systematically and regularly quantify the excess mortality 
associated with several mental disorders.
The estimate of 1·5 million deaths (95% UI 1·5 million 
to 1·6 million) due to diabetes, plus 418 000 deaths 
(389 000–441 000) from chronic kidney disease due to 
diabetes mellitus, still underestimates the full impact of 
diabetes on all-cause mortality because of the increased 
risk of ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and tuberculosis 
associated with diabetes.113–115 In the GBD framework, 
computation of deaths attributable to elevated fasting 
plasma glucose more comprehensively captures the 
eff
 ects of diabetes and pre-diabetes on mortality—see the 
GBD comparative risk assessment for 2015.116 Given the 
strong association between diabetes and obesity and the 
global rise of obesity, the fi
 nding that age-standardised 
death rates for diabetes, including chronic kidney disease 
due to diabetes mellitus, are not increasing suggests that 
other protective factors such as treatment might have an 
eff
 ect.117,118 Spatial patterns show marked variation in 
death rates, even in places with relatively similar 
prevalence such as Mexico and the USA.119 These 
variations in death rates could be related to variation in 
cause of death certifi
 cation, with some medical 
communities more likely than others to list diabetes as 
the underlying cause of death, or they might be due to 
treatment eff
 ects. Given the importance of diabetes as a 
cause of death already, and the likely global rise in 
prevalence of diabetes, more research is needed to 
understand the determinants of variation in diabetes 
death rates.119
In this analysis we have estimated that there were 
more deaths due to chronic kidney disease than in 
previous analyses because of improved estimates within 
countries with large populations such as China, India, 
and Russia. We have also improved our chronic kidney 
disease subtype estimation strategy by implementing 
consistent data source inclusion, as well as estimation 
strategy across the four subtypes. A further improvement 
is that we have narrowed the defi
 nition of deaths due to 
“chronic kidney disease other” so that deaths formerly 
included in this category are now attributed to original 
disease cause, such as polycystic kidney disease. Thus 
chronic kidney disease subtype mortality results will 
diff
 er notably from those of previous analyses. Our 
results indicate that, globally, deaths from chronic 
kidney disease increased among both males and females, 
but age-standardised death rates remained relatively 
unchanged in the past decade. Likely contributors 
include an increase in the burden of chronic kidney 
disease risk factors such as diabetes mellitus and 
hypertension. In 2015 Latin America had the highest 
chronic kidney disease death rates in the world. Within 
Mexico, the country with the highest chronic kidney 
disease death rate, more than half of patients with 
incident end-stage renal disease have an underlying 
diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.120 Unique aetiological 
contributors, such as those suspected in chronic kidney 
disease due to other causes, have been shown to cause 
chronic kidney disease deaths mostly in younger adults 
in El Salvador and Nicaragua, as well as Sri Lanka.121 
Eff
 orts to delay deaths due to end-stage renal disease 
currently depend on renal replacement therapy in 
the form of either maintenance dialysis or renal 
transplantation. These costly interventions require 
appropriate 
medical 
infrastructure, 
as 
well 
as 
government subsidisation, to be accessible to the general 
population. Therefore, these interventions are currently 
accessible mainly to populations in high-income 
countries.122 If deaths due to chronic kidney disease 
 Articles
1526 
www.thelancet.com   Vol 388   October 8, 2016
continue to increase globally, further research into 
possible ways to prevent chronic kidney disease, such as 
with population-level or individual-level approaches, is 
warranted. Given that many chronic kidney disease risk 
factors overlap with cardiovascular risk factors,123–125 
closer collaboration between these two specialties could 
foster preventive strategies in the future.
Injuries and fatal discontinuities
Experience and evidence from studies on intervention 
suggest that there is a potential to reduce road injury 
deaths through a range of interventions. Drunk driving 
bans, seat belt laws, road engineering including traffi
  c 
calming, safety devices in vehicles, speed limits, 
mandatory helmet usage, bans on mobile phone use 
while driving, and separation of vulnerable road users 
from vehicles have all been shown to be eff
 ective.126–130 
Progress in reducing road injury can be rapid. From 2005 
to 2015, western European countries such as Spain 
(43·8%, 
95% 
UI 
39·9–47·3), 
Portugal 
(39·6%, 
35·4–43·6), and Switzerland (18·8%, 11·8–25·4), had 
signifi
 cant reductions in total deaths. Such rapid 
decreases indicate that not only are there specifi
 c 
interventions that can work,131,132 but also that population-
level reductions are possible in a short period. A reverse 
trend is apparent in low-income and middle-income 
countries, partly because the growth in motorisation and 
traffi
  c density is outpacing the reductions associated 
with infrastructural development and levels of law 
enforcement. This trend is particularly the case for major 
fast-growing BRICS economies (Brazil, Russia, India, 
China, and South Africa).133–135
Global death rates due to interpersonal violence have 
decreased since 2005, but regional trends were much more 
diverse. Reductions were largest in Asian and European 
countries, but rates of deaths due to interpersonal violence 
in Latin America and southern sub-Saharan Africa 
remained quite high. Interpersonal violence can often be 
mitigated or reduced by addressing underlying drivers or 
risks, such as the accessibility of weapons and use of 
alcohol and psychoactive drugs.136–139 In 2015, self-harm was 
the second-leading cause of death from injury. Nearly half 
of all self-harm deaths occur in India and China, but the 
trends in these countries have reversed, decreasing 
signifi
 cantly in China but rising in India from 1990 to 
2015. Over the past two decades China and India have both 
experienced rapid economic growth and urbanisation, and 
therefore the opposing trends might be explained by other 
factors. Evidence from previous research has shown that a 
combination of preventive approaches addressing multiple 
factors, such as increased public awareness, programmes 
based on behavioural change and coping strategies, 
physician education, and decreased access to means of 
self-harm is needed.140–143
Age-standardised death rates from drowning fell by 
nearly 30% globally during the past decade, with greatest 
reductions occurring in China, southeast Asia, central 
Asia, and eastern and central Europe. The highest rates of 
death due to drowning in 2015 were in island nations of 
Oceania and in the Indian Ocean, southeast Asia, 
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and sub-Saharan African 
countries. Globally, drowning is a leading cause of death 
in children younger than 5 years. There is potential to 
reduce drowning deaths by preventive measures such as 
installing barriers, controlling access to water, education, 
swimming lessons and safe boating practices, and 
shipping and ferry regulations.144–146 However, change in 
access to open water with increasing urbanisation might 
be a more important factor driving down drowning deaths 
than specifi
 c prevention measures.
For GBD 2015 we systematically collected data on 
major transport accidents, natural and man-made 
disasters, wildfi
 res, pandemics, and wars. Although the 
accuracy of the death numbers due to some of these 
causes vary by country (ie, they are usually more accurate 
in stable or higher income countries), they tend to be 
more reliable than are the estimates for wars. Indeed, it 
has been challenging to accurately document the number 
of casualties from wars and deaths resulting from 
malnutrition, infections, or disruption in health services 
during wars.147–150 The challenge is due to scarcity of vital 
statistics during wars, the increase in refugee populations 
who are displaced internally or externally, and the fact 
that surveys can only capture mortality rates among 
those who have remained in their households during the 
time of interviews. Unfortunately, these estimates can 
also be challenging to capture with a future census 
because refugees might have settled in other countries. 
For example, it is estimated that more than 3 million 
Syrians have settled in neighbouring countries or 
elsewhere.151,152 Nonetheless, we believe that providing 
such estimates, even with a wide UI, will draw attention 
to the devastating eff
 ects of war on health and hopefully 
lead to better methods to estimate morbidity and 
mortality from wars.
Measurement challenges and opportunities
The assessment of all-cause mortality in GBD 2015 includes 
important innovations that have substantially increased 
uncertainty for adult mortality in some countries. We 
believe this is a much more accurate refl
 ection of our 
knowledge of age-specifi
 c mortality in countries without 
vital registration or sample registration systems. The most 
important changes included processing of sibling history 
data using single years rather than pooling data for 5-year 
intervals, and the propagation of uncertainty in HIV
/AIDS 
crude death rates used in the fi
 rst stage of the spatiotemporal 
Gaussian process regression model into the estimation of 
45q15. In addition to these changes, we have greatly 
improved our parameter selection process for both 5q0 and 
45q15 Gaussian process regression to refl
 ect data density 
and quality of data partly represented by the data variance. 
Combined, these changes led to an increased uncertainty 
interval for 45q15. In many countries in Africa, the width of 
 Articles
www.thelancet.com   Vol 388   October 8, 2016 
1527
the uncertainty interval for 45q15 more than doubled. The 
increase in the uncertainty interval for 45q15 directly leads 
to higher uncertainty intervals for our age-specifi
 c mortality 
rate estimates. This partly helped with the removal of an 
arbitrary matching algorithm from GBD 2013, which 
picked the pairs of draws of all-cause mortality and HIV-
specifi
 c mortality estimates that were consistent. With the 
widened uncertainty interval in all-cause mortality 
estimates, we are able to apply the ensemble model to 
combine 
draw-level 
HIV
/AIDS 
mortality 
estimates 
from the demographic estimation process and the 
epidemiological model of EPP-Spectrum for all 1000 draws.
Cause of death data for low SDI countries in 
sub-Saharan Africa were limited to a small number of 
mostly local verbal autopsy data often with small sample 
size. Members of the INDEPTH network of demographic 
surveillance systems have been collecting verbal autopsy 
data in some sites for many years.153 In the development 
of the GBD cause of death database, we have been able to 
make only limited use of INDEPTH verbal autopsy data 
collected in multiple sites. Some INDEPTH members 
like Matlab routinely release physician-certifi
 ed verbal 
autopsy data in full detail whereas others have published 
periodic results in journal articles. In 2015, 22 INDEPTH 
sites published INTERVA model predictions of individual 
causes of death for the period 1992 to 2012.153 No primary 
data from the verbal autopsy interviews have been 
released to date. Unfortunately, INTERVA model 
predictions are highly inaccurate. The only validation 
study comparing INTERVA to an objectively defi
 ned 
cause of death standard at the individual level found it 
accurately assigned the cause of death in 23·8% of adult 
deaths, 30·3% of child deaths, and 19·4% of neonatal 
deaths; at the population level, estimated cause-specifi
 c 
mortality fractions were not better than random 
guessing.154,155 This potentially important resource for 
global health estimation is being underused because of 
the limitations of current versions of the INTERVA tool 
for cause ascertainment. Given that injury death 
assignment might (although there are no objective 
validation data on this issue) be more plausibly established 
from INTERVA, we have chosen to use the INTERVA 
results from INDEPTH for eight types of injuries: 
transport injuries; falls; drowning; fi
 re, heat, and hot 
substances; poisonings; venomous animal contact; self-
harm; and interpersonal violence. Hopefully, a large 
number of deaths from INDEPTH verbal autopsies will 
be assessed using physician-certifi
 ed verbal autopsy or 
more robust computer algorithms in the future.
In GBD 2013, for select causes, we developed separate 
CODEm models for countries with long series of 
complete vital registration data in order that UI estimation 
in these settings was not aff
 ected by UI in settings with 
either less complete or lower quality data. For GBD 2015, 
we standardised this approach. We defi
 ned countries with 
extensive complete vital registration representation as 
those with vital registration equal to or more than 95% 
complete for more than 25 years. We also modifi
 ed the 
ranges of psi used in testing diff
 erent ensemble models 
to be higher, eff
 ectively allowing CODEm to evaluate out-
of-sample ensembles made up of fewer models. In 
countries with nearly complete high-quality time series, 
smaller numbers of models in the ensemble allow the 
models to follow the data more closely with narrower UIs 
for many but not all causes.
It is extremely diffi
  cult to properly inform national and 
global policy responses to reduce mortality when 
available cause of death information is very sparse, 
outdated, or unreliable. Fortunately, there is now 
evidence of increased investment and technical support 
being off
 ered to countries to improve their vital 
registration systems. Important new partnerships have 
been formed between major bilateral donors and 
philanthropic organisations,156 building on earlier eff
 orts 
of the Health Metrics Network and the Australian 
development assistance program, AusAID.157,158 Regional 
UN-led partnerships, particularly in Africa and the Asia-
Pacifi
 c region, are also helping governments to 
understand the essential role of good vital registration 
systems in development, and advocating for change. The 
interventions now being off
 ered in many countries 
include targeted and strategic training of doctors to 
correctly fi
 ll out death certifi
 cates that identify the 
underlying cause of death; improving practices and 
exploiting information technology advances to more 
eff
 ectively register deaths, consolidate and validate data, 
and transfer information more effi
  ciently to policy-
relevant destinations; and, perhaps most importantly, 
facilitating the widespread adoption of automated verbal 
autopsy methods to cost-eff
 ectively provide information 
on causes of death in populations for which these data 
are unavailable.2 Although the initial focus of these 
eff
 orts is on improving data systems, a substantial impact 
on data quality and availability can be reasonably expected 
within the next 3–5 years.159 This will not only improve 
the evidence base for guiding local policy decisions, but 
will also lead to reduced uncertainty in global comparative 
mortality assessments, such as the GBD study.
WHO led the process of developing new guidelines for 
reporting on global health estimation.20 For GBD 2015, 
we invested substantial resources to ensure that the 
GBD 2015 studies, including this Article, are compliant 
with the GATHER recommendations. Figures 1 and 2 
provide detailed workfl
 ow diagrams. In appendices and 
the Global Health Data Exchange, we also provide 
detailed documentation of all sources used in the 
analysis. For each step in the workfl
 ow diagrams, 
computer code is either on GitHub, such as CODEm 
2015 and DisMod-MR 2.1,160,161 or available on the IHME 
website for download. Enhanced transparency and 
documentation highlight the multiple interconnections 
between analyses, for example, the strong connections 
between HIV
/AIDS incidence, prevalence, and mortality 
estimation and all-cause mortality estimation in 
 Articles

countries with large epidemics. Across this assessment, 
there are hundreds of separate analytical steps; for each 
we documented input data, code, and information on 
model development and performance.
Limitations
Here we highlight some broad cross-cutting limitations 
to the GBD mortality and cause of death analysis. The 
analysis of all-cause mortality in countries without vital 
registration systems is critically dependent on the validity 
of sibling history data for measuring adult mortality. 
Although we show, with appropriate corrections for 
survivor bias (methods appendix pp 21–24), that sibling 
history data are unbiased when compared with vital 
registration data, these comparisons are not available for 
sub-Saharan Africa, where sibling history data are of key 
importance. Sibling histories in some African countries 
might underestimate mortality due to the practice of 
adoption in some countries, but empirical studies in 
these settings have not confi
 rmed any consistent 
underestimation of adult mortality.162
All-cause mortality in settings with vital registration is 
corrected for under-registration using the three available 
demographic methods for the detection of under-
registration: generalised growth balance, synthetic 
extinct generations, and a hybrid approach of these two 
methods. However, these methods, as shown in 
simulation studies,26 are unbiased but imprecise. To 
further stabilise our estimates of vital registration 
completeness over time, we synthesise raw estimates of 
completeness from death distribution methods and 
implied child death registration completeness by 
comparing vital registration to GBD under-5 mortality 
estimates into one coherent time series. Despite these 
eff
 orts, estimates of completeness can change between 
GBD revisions as new census data become available or 
new surveys are released. We propagate uncertainty into 
the all-cause mortality in the analysis of completeness, 
but these UIs might be underestimates in some settings 
because of the scarcity of available data.
Because of the close connection between the estimation 
of all-cause mortality and HIV
/AIDS incidence, 
prevalence, and mortality in countries with large 
epidemics, all limitations pertaining to HIV modelling 
also apply to our estimates of all-cause mortality. For 
GBD 2015, we used an ensemble model for HIV in which 
the demographic model and the natural history model of 
HIV
/AIDS death are combined. Despite these attempts 
to triangulate on the magnitude of the HIV
/AIDS 
epidemic, we assume that the CD4 progression rate, 
off
 -ART death rates, and on-ART death rates for 
age–sex–CD4 categories are the same throughout sub-
Saharan Africa. Because of other factors, such as co-
infections with tropical diseases or nutritional status, 
CD4 progression rates can vary across populations. It is 
also likely that the quality of and access to ART 
programmes varies across communities, and thus 
on-ART death rates might well vary. Because of the 
strong assumptions made in the natural history models 
(assumptions also made by UNAIDS163) about the 
consistency of these parameter values across countries, 
we might be underestimating the true variation in 
HIV
/AIDS death rates and all-cause mortality.
Our cause of death analysis depends substantially on 
the validity of medical certifi
 cation of causes of death and 
physician-certifi
 ed verbal autopsies. Although eff
 orts to 
redistribute garbage codes to likely underlying causes of 
death help to enhance comparability, our fi
 ndings are 
aff
 ected by systematic bias in medical certifi
 cation of 
causes of death. We see in the rapid increase in certain 
causes of death on death certifi
 cates—such as 
Alzheimer’s and other dementias, or atrial fi
 brillation—
evidence of diagnostic trends that are generally 
incompatible with time series data even after garbage 
code redistribution. For these reasons, we used other 
methods to estimate these particular causes of death. 
However, these patterns suggest that garbage coding 
practices not only vary by country but also across time.
Our results depend critically on the validity of our 
approach to garbage code redistribution. As we further 
utilised statistical methods to establish redistribution 
algorithms over the development of the GBD 2015 results, 
we saw sizeable changes in major causes of death. For 
example, changes in how left-sided heart failure and right-
sided heart failure are analysed substantially changed 
the number of deaths reassigned to pneumoconiosis, 
haemoglobinopathies, or COPD. We believe these changes 
refl
 ect improvements in our methods, but they also show 
how some causes of death, even though they result in lower 
absolute levels of mortality, can be profoundly aff
 ected by 
the redistribution of large garbage codes such as heart 
failure or sepsis. The sensitivity of our fi
 ndings to how 
major garbage codes, such as heart failure, sepsis, or 
ICD-X59 (exposure to unspecifi
 ed factor), are redistributed 
emphasises the importance of more systematic research on 
garbage code practices and improvements in primary data 
collection to avoid deaths being certifi
 ed to garbage codes.
We used CODEm to model all causes for which 
suffi
  cient numbers of deaths are observed in vital 
registration, sample registration, or verbal autopsy 
datasets. For these 167 causes, we conducted rigorous 
out-of-sample validation exercises and documented 
prediction error and UI coverage. However, for the 
remaining causes, particularly those modelled with 
natural history models, the design of validation tests was 
severely limited by data sparseness. In the absence of 
better data collection, particularly for causes of death that 
mostly occur in data-sparse geographies, our options for 
more robust model validation will remain limited. The 
analysis of causes of death in India also has important 
ramifi
 cations for global estimates. The three major 
sources of cause of death information for India are the 
Medical Certifi
 cation of Causes of Death (MCCD), largely 
collected in urban areas; the Survey of Causes of Death

(Rural; SCD[R]); and verbal autopsy data collected for 
deaths recorded in the Sample Registration System (SRS) 
from 2001 to 2013. All three systems are or 
were maintained by the Registrar-General of India. 
Unfortunately, whereas the MCCD and SCD(R) data 
have been released in considerable age, sex, and cause 
detail for states in India, the SRS data have been released 
only for large aggregates and not at the state level, 
although various academic works using data for 2002–04 
have been published for specifi
 c causes with varying 
levels of detail. The rich resource of the SRS verbal 
autopsy data could be much more informative if the 
standard WHO table of ICD code, age, and sex were 
publicly released.
Available data from some countries in sub-Saharan 
Africa pose substantial challenges for cause of death 
analysis. Only extremely scarce verbal autopsy data are 
currently 
available 
for 
large 
populations. 
Given 
substantial gradients in mortality within Nigeria, for 
example, there is substantial risk of over-interpreting the 
limited verbal autopsy data. Civil registration data are 
collected in Nigeria, but the completeness is low and the 
level of garbage coding is very high. New data for 
countries in the sub-Saharan African region would 
substantially narrow a major source of uncertainty in 
sub-Saharan African causes of death.
It is possible that some of the heterogeneity reported in 
observed and expected causes of early death in diff
 erent 
geographies has been artifi
 cially created by variations in 
data quality and the use of diff
 erent methods. The GBD 
group makes extensive eff
 orts to try to reduce the eff
 ects 
of variable data quality, and we have used standardised 
methods for each cause that are the same for all countries.
Lastly, although our estimates of uncertainty intervals 
refl
 ect multiple sources of uncertainty, they do not 
include every possible source of uncertainty. For all-cause 
mortality, we include uncertainty due to the following: 
sampling error in the underlying data; non-sampling 
error associated with particular child or adult mortality 
data types; HIV/AIDS crude death rate; and reference 
age pattern of mortality used in the GBD model life table. 
We do not, however, include uncertainty in the 
measurement of income per capita or educational 
attainment, and we do not include uncertainty from the 
choice of our model specifi
 cation for the fi
 rst stage of the 
spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression analysis. 
For causes of death, we capture sampling uncertainty, 
 
model specifi
 cation uncertainty through the creation of 
CODEm ensembles, and non-sampling error from 
subnational or non-representative datasets. We do not, 
however, capture uncertainty due to garbage code 
redistribution, uncertainty in the covariates used in the 
models, or uncertainty due to cause of death assignment 
in verbal autopsy data. With each iteration of the GBD we 
have sought to include more comprehensively diff
 erent 
sources of uncertainty, and we expect this evolution to 
continue in the future.
Comparison of diff
 erent global health estimates
The GBD 2015 estimates for under-5 deaths due to 
diarrhoea and lower respiratory infection diff
 er from 
estimates by other agencies, such as the WHO 
Department of Evidence, Information, and Research and 
the Maternal and Child Epidemiology Estimation 
(MCEE) group (results appendix pp 3985–89).164 In 2015, 
we estimated the number of under-5 deaths as 
5·8 million (95% UI 5·7 million to 6·0 million), which 
was lower than the MCEE’s estimate of 5 945 000 (95% 
CI 5 707 000–6 395 000) for that year.165 Our estimates of 
under-5 deaths due to diarrhoea for 2015 were also lower, 
at 499 000 (447 000–558 000), than those of the MCEE 
group (526 000), although we attributed more diarrhoeal 
deaths among neonates. For 2015, our results for under-5 
lower respiratory infection deaths were notably lower 
than the estimates produced by MCEE, especially 
for children aged 1 to 59 months (ie, 557 000 
[488 000–633 000]) from GBD 2015 and 760 000 from 
MCEE. Based on the latest estimates for aetiologies of 
diarrhoea and lower respiratory infection produced by 
the Child Health Epidemiology Research Group 
(CHERG), which is now known as MCEE,166 we found 
that our estimates for rotavirus are similar for the year 
2010. However, in GBD 2015, the estimates for 
Cryptosporidium were fi
 ve times higher than those of 
CHERG, and the estimates for Shigella were 2·5 times 
higher. These diff
 erences might arise from variations in 
estimation approaches, as well as the use of various 
sources and types of data. For example, CHERG 
generated estimates of pathogen-specifi
 c diarrhoea 
based on the proportion of hospitalised cases of 
diarrhoea that tested positive for each pathogen,167 
whereas the GBD study uses a counterfactual approach 
that includes odds ratios of disease given exposure and 
corrects pathogen prevalence estimates using the results 
from a PCR analysis of samples from GEMS.78 Estimates 
of deaths due to rotavirus in GBD 2015 and CHERG 
were similar, which is not surprising given the good 
diagnostic validity of ELISA for rotavirus. However, GBD 
2015 estimates for bacterial pathogens were generally 
higher, which refl
 ects the relatively low sensitivity and 
specifi
 city of conventional diagnostic methods for these 
pathogens.77 For pneumonia, estimates for bacterial 
aetiologies from GBD 2015 were similar to those from 
CHERG in terms of total lower respiratory infection 
deaths and generating similarly large wide uncertainty 
intervals. However, H infl
 uenzae type b estimates were 
lower than the CHERG results for GBD 2015, and our 
estimates for under-5 deaths due to pneumococcal 
pneumonia deaths were higher than the CHERG 
estimates. These diff
 erences probably stem from our 
eff
 orts to correct for vaccine effi
  cacy against bacteraemic 
pneumococcal disease to instead represent the effi
  cacy 
against pneumococcal pneumonia. This correction 
greatly 
increases 
the 
attributable 
fraction, 
and 
uncertainty, for pneumococcal pneumonia.

IARC last produced cancer estimates by country, age, 
sex, and cancer site for 2012 (GLOBOCAN).168 GBD 
and GLOBOCAN defi
 nitions are compatible for 
25 cancer types. For these cancer sites, the total estimated 
number of deaths from GLOBOCAN is 7 498 760 in 2012. 
By comparison, the GBD 2015 estimate was 7 823 429 
(7 374 053–8 241 385) for 2012. Worldwide, the largest 
diff
 erences between estimates were for larynx cancer, 
other pharynx cancers, thyroid cancer, nasopharynx 
cancer, and myeloma, with diff
 erences of 20–85%. 
GLOBOCAN has been a source for descriptive global 
cancer epidemiology for many years. However, GBD 
analyses 
have 
some 
advantages 
over 
the 
past 
GLOBOCAN estimates. One advantage is that the 
annual GBD updates allow for the incorporation of new 
data rapidly. We expect the availability of cancer registry 
data in low-income and middle-income countries to 
increase due to the Global Initiative for Cancer Registry 
Development, which is led by IARC. These data, in 
addition to increasing the availability of cause of death 
data, will lead to improvements in cancer estimates, 
especially for regions with sparse data, and will allow 
policy makers to adjust health-care strategies in 
accordance with the latest evidence. The GBD study also 
provides the unique opportunity for direct comparison 
of the cancer burden with that of other diseases and 
therefore for health system investments guided 
by objective, comprehensive estimates rather than 
incomplete, unreliable data and advocacy. Furthermore, 
the GBD 2015 study is compliant with the GATHER 
guidelines, including reporting uncertainty intervals for 
each cancer estimate.
A comparison of GBD 2013, GBD 2015, and the two 
most recent UNAIDS assessments of global HIV
/AIDS 
mortality over time is shown in the results appendix p 4). 
Although, as noted, GBD methods have changed 
substantially, our results at the global level are fairly 
consistent with previous iterations of GBD analyses. 
UNAIDS, in their latest revision, noticeably changed 
their assessment of peak global HIV
/AIDS mortality 
from 2·24 million deaths in 2005 to 2·0 million deaths,169 
rendering increased consistency between the latest 
UNAIDS statistics and GBD 2015. Although it is 
encouraging that thoughtful analyses of the epidemic 
and its mortality consequences are converging, additional 
analysis is needed to discern the diff
 erences between the 
estimates from GBD and UNAIDS, and the changes that 
occurred in the estimation series by GBD or UNAIDS. 
It is important to understand diff
 erences and changes in 
models and underlying assumptions such as on-ART 
and off
 -ART mortality and their eff
 ects on the metrics of 
HIV
/AIDS incidence, prevalence, and mortality provided 
by GBD and UNAIDS. GBD 2015 mostly used 
epidemiological and programmatic data provided by 
UNAIDS in its 2015 iteration. The signifi
 cant diff
 erence 
between GBD and UNAIDS might mark the important 
diff
 erence in assumptions for on-ART and off
 -ART 
mortality, CD4 progression ratio, and background 
mortality rates. In the GBD studies, we have also found 
that results are highly sensitive to the assumptions of 
initial CD4 count used in both the analysis of pre-ART 
cohort data and the initial population distribution of CD4 
count for new infections.11
The other major eff
 ort to estimate age-specifi
 c 
all-cause mortality and life expectancy other than the 
annual GBD is the biennial United Nations Population 
Division assessment published in the World Population 
Prospects.170 Although the UN calculates estimates for 
each age–sex–country–year, the UN Population Division 
publishes data for most metrics only in 5-year intervals. 
The UN has yet to publish since the introduction of the 
new WHO GATHER guidelines and, in most cases, the 
statistical method used to generate estimates of 
age-specifi
 c mortality is unclear for any given country 
and hard to reproduce with no codes made available. 
A comparison of GBD 2015 life expectancy estimates 
and the UN Population Division estimates for the 
midpoint of 2010–15 is available in the results appendix 
(p 5). For the 189 countries for which both series provide 
estimates, GBD 2015 tends to have higher estimates of 
life expectancy at birth for both males (111 countries) 
and females (112 countries). The diff
 erences are even 
more prominent for the time period 1980–85, for which 
GBD life expectancy is higher for 139 countries and 
territories for males and 134 for females. Although the 
correlation between the two sets of estimates is 0·94 for 
males and 0·97 for females for the period 1980 to 2015, 
there are systematic diff
 erences in all four GBD 
geographical regions in Africa, north Africa and the 
Middle east, south Asia, and Oceania, for which the 
correlation coeffi
  cient is less than 0·9. In southern sub-
Saharan Africa, the UN Population Division estimates 
are 0·1 year (95% UI −3·9 to 3·6) lower for males and 
1·7 years (−6·3 to 3·3 years) lower for females on 
average in these countries around the peak of the 
HIV/AIDS epidemic in 2002. This diff
 erence exists 
mainly because their estimates are based on estimated 
under-5 death rates and model life tables, based on 
patterns of mortality in the Coale-Demeny model life 
table system and the United Nations Model Life Tables 
for Developing Countries, that are in turn based on 
observations of age patterns of mortality before 
1980.31,32,170 Unlike UN estimates, GBD estimates of adult 
mortality rates take into account corrected sibling 
history data collected in household surveys, which 
provide direct measurements of adult mortality. The 
empirical information about adult mortality, used as an 
entry parameter to GBD’s model life table system, 
certainly helps to improve the accuracy of our mortality 
age pattern assessment, even in countries aff
 ected by 
the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
Another important diff
 erence emerged between the 
GBD and UN Population Division assessments: 
mortality and population numbers among youths.

For the period 2010–14, the UN Population Division 
estimates that 6·3 million deaths occurred globally 
among people aged 5–14 years, whereas GBD estimates 
this number at 4·6 million.170 The diff
 erence is mostly 
driven by the diff
 erences between the Coale-Demeny 
life tables used by the UN compared with our life tables, 
which use much more recent empirical patterns of 
mortality, and diff
 erent assessments of under-5 
mortality rate that come from diff
 erences in both 
treatment of data and data synthesis methods. Hill and 
colleagues171 reported that, based on complete birth 
histories in the Demographic and Health Surveys 
(DHS), which are mostly based in low-income and 
middle-income countries, mortality among youths 
might also be much higher than was estimated in 
GBD 2010. As a data source, long-term recall by mothers 
of their 5–14-year-old children’s deaths, using complete 
birth histories, has not been validated. We examined the 
estimates of mortality in India in the 5–14 years age 
groups from the SRS, which directly measures 
age-specifi
 c mortality in a sample of 7597 villages in 
rural areas and census enumeration blocks in urban 
areas in India. We compared these estimates with those 
from the GBD 2015 and found that estimates from the 
two series are highly concordant, with a correlation 
coeffi
  cient of 0·95 for the 5–14 years age group and a 
mean relative diff
 erence of −2·2% for the probability of 
death between the ages of 10 and 14 years in the period 
1980 to 2012. Our estimated age pattern of mortality for 
India is mainly informed by data from the SRS, with 
exceptions in children younger than 5 years, for whom 
our under-5 mortality rate data synthesis takes into 
account under-5 mortality rate estimates from other 
sources, including the India DHS. As shown in the 
methods appendix (pp 293–96), for the 5–9 years age 
group, GBD 2015 estimates of probability of death are 
mostly consistent with those extracted from the DHS. 
For the 10–14 years age group, GBD estimates are 
consistent with both DHS and SRS.
In 2014, WHO published cause-specifi
 c mortality 
estimates at global, regional, and country levels for the 
years 2000 and 2012.172 WHO used GBD 2010 mortality 
results for all but 12 cause groups, for which WHO and 
UN agencies have historically produced estimates.172–174 
These 12 causes are tuberculosis, HIV
/AIDS and other 
sexually transmitted infections, malaria, whooping 
cough, measles, schistosomiasis, maternal disorders, 
cancers, alcohol and drug use disorders, epilepsy, confl
 ict 
and natural disasters, and road traffi
  c accidents.172,173 
WHO has also generated estimates of YLLs, but 
comparisons of WHO estimates with those of GBD are 
limited because WHO chose to use the highest projected 
life expectancy for 2050—91·9 years—rather than the 
GBD 2010 normative standard life expectancy of 
86·0 years for 2010.172 GBD 2010 did not include mortality 
estimates for the year 2012, so WHO estimates for that 
year were interpolated.
Conclusion
A key goal, if not the fundamental goal, of a health 
system is to prolong life, especially healthy life, into 
old age. To do so, decision makers in health need 
comprehensive and disaggregated evidence on com-
parative mortality levels in populations, particularly for 
causes of death that are largely preventable through 
political action, either through improving health services 
or strengthening prevention programmes. Traditionally, 
this evidence has been limited to the fi
 ndings of 
relatively conventional and straightforward mortality 
analyses. As our results show, more novel approaches 
can provide much more detailed and systematic 
descriptions of how survival status and cause of death 
patterns vary according to measures such as SDI, which 
are becoming increasingly relevant for policy as overall 
mortality levels fall. Overall population health is likely to 
improve more rapidly in places where the relationships 
between determinants of health and cause-specifi
 c 
mortality patterns are understood—especially areas 
where addressing of these gradients is a key priority for 
health and development policy. Our analyses provide 
important new evidence on where such gradients in 
survival among populations are greatest, and for which 
causes of death. Thus, although we found continued 
reductions in major communicable diseases such as 
HIV/AIDS and malaria in response to concerted global 
action, and further, albeit more modest reductions in the 
risk of death from NCDs and injuries, the comprehensive 
analysis of the eff
 ect of SDI on health, across and among 
countries, is likely to be much more relevant for 
accelerating global health progress.
