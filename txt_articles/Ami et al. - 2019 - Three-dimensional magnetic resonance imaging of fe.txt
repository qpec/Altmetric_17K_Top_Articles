Abstract
To demonstrate and describe fetal head molding and brain shape changes during delivery,
we used three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 3D finite element
mesh reconstructions to compare the fetal head between prelabor and the second stage of
labor. A total of 27 pregnant women were examined with 3D MRI sequences before going
into labor using a 1 Tesla open field MRI. Seven of these patients subsequently had another
set of 3D MRI sequences during the second stage of labor. Volumes of 2D images were
transformed into finite element 3D reconstructions. Polygonal meshes for each part of the
fetal body were used to study fetal head molding and brain shape changes. Varying degrees
of fetal head molding were present in the infants of all seven patients studied during the sec-
ond phase of labor compared with the images acquired before birth. The cranial deforma-
tion, however, was no longer observed after birth in five out of the seven newborns, whose
post-natal cranial parameters were identical to those measured before delivery. The chang-
ing shape of the fetal brain following the molding process and constraints on the brain tissue
were observed in all the fetuses. Of the three fetuses presenting the greatest molding of the
skull bones and brain shape deformation, two were delivered by cesarean-section (one after
a forceps failure and one for engagement default), while the fetus presenting with the great-
est skull molding and brain shape deformation was born physiologically. This study demon-
strates the value of 3D MRI study with 3D finite element mesh reconstruction during the
second stage of labor to reveal how the fetal brain is impacted by the molding of the cranial
bones. Fetal head molding was systematically observed when the fetal head was engaged
between the superior pelvic strait and the middle brim.

 Introduction
Humans have a pelvis that is less conducive to easy delivery of the large fetal head than other
mammals. Factors related to a safe vaginal delivery include an adequately sized and shaped
maternal bony pelvis, soft tissue shaping of the birth canal during delivery, sufficient uterine
contractions, and a fetal head of the proper size and ability to mold. Labor dystocia most often
results from a combination of these fetal and maternal factors. Even when vaginal delivery is
possible, the birth process can be traumatic to the infant, with asymptomatic brain hemor-
rhages[1] and retinal hemorrhages[2] occurring in up to 43% of vaginally delivered neonates
[3].
A minor degree of pelvic dystocia, asynclitism and molding of the fetal head can precipitate
a difficult vaginal delivery [4]. A prediction before onset of spontaneous or induced labor of
the final route of delivery–vaginal or cesarean (C)-section–is desired by mother and physician.
[5]. Unfortunately, most pelvic dystocia cases are not diagnosed until labor is well advanced.
Little is known about the possible causes or mechanisms of labor dystocia and brain and reti-
nal hemorrhage. Predictive models, such as the three-dimensional (3D) birth simulation soft-
ware Predibirth (Olivier Ami, France), require study of the process of birth with 3D imaging
[6].
With this in mind, we performed sequential Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) imaging
and 3D reconstruction of the fetal skull and brain in a series of normal pregnancies with
planned vaginal deliveries before the onset of labor and then during the second stage of labor.
The study’s aim was to describe fetal head molding during the birthing process.
Materials and methods
Seven pregnant women were examined with 3D MRI before going into labor and during the
second stage of labor [6]. This prospective biomedical observational study (IMAGINAITRE)
was approved by the French ethical Institutional Review Board "Ile de France II" (ID-RCB
2012-A01469-34) and by the French National Agency for Drug and Medical Product Safety
(Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament et des Produits de Santé) and promoted by the
University of Clermont-Ferrand Medical Center. All the women agreed to participate and
signed an informed consent.
Clinical protocol
Women recruited for the study were pregnant, aged 21–39 years, had an effective epidural dur-
ing labor, were primipara, secundipara or tertipara, and had no known factors that could
impair vaginal delivery. Exclusion criteria included not strictly cephalic presentation at the
time of delivery, scarred uterus, more than three prior pregnancies, maternal or fetal medical
conditions known to require or requiring urgent care, abnormal fetal heart rate requiring
treatment within half an hour, contraindications to MRI, a minor or incompetent adult
patient, no prior obstetrical care during pregnancy, or a Magnin score less than 22 cm.
Pre-labor MRI was performed between 36 and 39 weeks of gestation. Imaging during the
second stage of labor was performed no more than 10 minutes before the onset of expulsive
efforts. Entry into the second phase of labor was marked by complete cervical dilation accom-
panied by descent of the fetal head, with engagement between the superior pelvic strait and the
middle of the pelvic brim verified by clinical examination. The patients were imaged in the
dorsal decubitus position for both studies and were at rest during the MRI scans, just before

 pushing. The attending obstetrician examined the newborn cranial anatomy for the presence
of molding.
Special considerations were made for the safety of mother and child as previously described
[6]. Briefly, patients were cared for during the study by dedicated teams consisting of an obste-
trician, radiologist, midwife, and pediatrician. Patient transportation time from the MRI suite
to the delivery room in the same building, bed to bed, was less than 3 minutes. All patients
received the same attention, monitoring and standard of safety as patients undergoing routine
delivery.
Patient population
The physical characteristics of these seven women and their birthing processes have been
described [6]. The women were 23–34 years of age, beyond 39 weeks gestation, and had a Mag-
nin score of 25.1 to 27.5. The fetuses descended a range of 23.1 to 53.8 mm and had an angle of
progression ranging from 17. 6˚ to 48. 5˚, according to Dietz et al.[7]. Membranes were rup-
tured in 6 of the 7 women.
Newborn weight ranged from 3095 to 4525 g. One patient had a 1-minute Apgar score of 4
and all the other 1-minute and all 10-minute Apgar scores were 10. Five children were born by
vaginal delivery without instrumentation and two by emergency C-section (one of these after
forceps failure).
Imaging protocol
The same protocol was used for the tests, both before and during the second stage of labor,
with the same sequences, the same coils, and the same conditions of maternal position.
The sequences used were fast and contiguous, lasting approximately 30 seconds each, with-
out any contrast injection. The duration of data acquisition never exceeded 12 minutes.
The protocol included a localization sequence, acquisition of contiguous frontal, sagittal
and axial T1-weighted, 3D gradient echo, as well as a T2-weighted acquisition of fetal brain
volume and a dynamic acquisition for one minute sagittally centered on the birth canal.

The imaging was performed in an open 1-T Philips Panorama MRI, located in the same
building as the maternity ward.
Image analysis
The image analyses were performed by two radiologists experienced in the field of perinatal
MRI. Inter-observer agreement was obtained after a discussion of the findings.

 Images and 3D reconstructions were reset to fixed points of the maternal pelvis (acetabulum,
pubis, iliac crests, the promontory of the sacrum, coccyx) in order to facilitate comparison.
The height reached by the fetal presentation during labor was evaluated according to imag-
ing criteria proposed by Dietz et al. [7] and correlated in MRI by Bamberg et al. [8] (Fig 1).
Post-processing of 3D imaging
The Predibirth software (Olivier Ami, France) [10,11] was used to perform 3D vector recon-
structions. Computer-aided vectorization of the contours was performed, and the results were
evaluated by obstetricians and radiologists.
Statistical analysis
Fisher’s exact test was used to test the null hypothesis of independence between fetal descent
and the observed changes. The statistical difference between head measurements before and
during second stage of labor was assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
Fig 1. Measure of the height reached by the fetal presentation during labor. The height reached by the fetal
presentation during labor was evaluated according to imaging criteria proposed by Dietz et al. The measurement
method consisted of the definition of a perpendicular reference to the major axis of the symphysis pubis in the sagittal
plane through the lower edge of the pubis, and the measurement of the height of the descent of the lowest point of the
fetal head compared to this reference line (A), as well as measuring the difference in height between prelabor and the
second stage of labor. The angle of progression was also measured (B). This angle was described by Barbera et al. [9],
and represents the angle between a line placed through the midline of the pubic symphysis and a line running from the
inferior apex of the symphysis perpendicular to the pubic midline, and to the most anterior part of the fetal skull.

 A P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical tests were
2-sided.
Results
I) Fetal head molding and brain shape changes
The MRI prior to labor did not demonstrate overlapping fetal sutures in any of the fetuses. In
contrast, all seven fetuses exhibited fetal head molding with overlapping cranial sutures during
the second stage of labor (Figs 1 and 2). Physical examination of the newborns revealed
deformed head contours in only two of the seven infants (patients 1 and 7, Table 1), proving
the flexibility of the molding system.
Overlapping of the cranial sutures was most marked in the anterior-posterior direction, at
the coronal and lambdoid suture. In all cases, at least one of the parietal bones was shifted to a
position below the corresponding frontal bone (coronal suture). There was variable shifting of
the left and right parietal bones in relation to each other (left below right, n = 1; right below
left, n = 4; no overlap, n = 2). Similar variability was observed with overlap of the occipital
bone and the parietal bone at the lambdoid suture (Table 1). Together these changes led to the
characteristic molding of the bones (Fig 3) and brain (Fig 4) observed at childbirth in the ante-
roposterior direction, so-called "sugarloaf" head molding.
There was variable shifting of the left and right frontal bones (metopic suture) relative to
each other (left below right, n = 1; right below left, n = 3; no overlap, n = 3). Less overlap was
observed at the sagittal and metopic sutures (Table 1). No correlation was found between the
side of overlap of the metopic and coronal sutures. The bregmatic and lambdoid fontanelles
markedly decreased in size in all patients upon entering the middle pelvic brim during the sec-
ond stage of labor.
The sphenotemporal, sphenofrontal, sphenoparietal, sphenobasioccipital, and occipitomas-
toid sutures never showed overlap of related bones in any of the seven imaged fetuses. The
sphenoid fontanel was enlarged in all fetuses during delivery.
The relationship between fetal descent and fetal head shape was evaluated. Fetuses during
the second stage of labor had a significantly higher incidence of "sugarloaf" deformation of
skull and brain than those before labor (Fig 5) (Table 2, Fisher’s exact test, p = .00058).

bone (green) is shown to slightly overlap the occipital bone (red). There is also slight overlap of the frontal bone (blue)
over the parietal bone (green). A characteristic "sugarloaf" deformation of the fetal head was observed on MRI. Similar
findings were observed in all fetuses. Suture overlapping was greater in the anterior-posterior direction, especially at
the coronal and lambdoid suture, and less important at the sagittal and metopic sutures (Table 1). The head of this
fetus kept the “sugar loaf” shape after birth.

 II) Correlation between imaging findings and clinical outcome
Fetal head molding was observed mostly on the anteroposterior axis (Table 2). The largest
change associated with molding was the reduction in fronto-occipital diameter (FOD) from
before labor to during the second stage of labor (p = .035, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). This
finding correlated with Magnin score and the distance of fetal descent into the pelvis according
to the model proposed by Dietz et al. [7]
Patients were selected before delivery on the presumption that if their pregnancies and
labors were normal, their deliveries would also be normal. However, two of the seven patients
developed clinical cephalopelvic dystocia requiring C-section for delivery (patients 3 and 7,
Table 2). One of the patients was found to have the fetal head at the middle of the pelvic brim
on clinical exam, while MRI showed the fetal head to be between the superior pelvic strait and
the middle brim (patient 7, Table 2). These two fetuses had two of the three greatest FOD
reductions from prelabor to the second stage of labor. These findings reinforce the difficulty
that can occur when using pelvimetry alone to predict the feasibility of vaginal delivery.

Frontal bones are marked in pink, parietal bones in green, and the occipital bone in blue. In the anterior view (A, B) the bregmatic fontanelle was observed to decrease in
size during delivery. In the lateral view (C, D) the skull bones were shown to change in relative orientation and amount of overlap. On the superior view (E,F) the
bregmatic and lambdoid fontanels were seen to decrease in size during delivery.

 The greatest reduction in FOD (patient 4, Table 2) occurred in the tertipara patient. She
had the largest fetus (4525 g) and had a spontaneous vaginal delivery requiring a minimal
amount of expulsive effort lasting approximately 15 minutes. Fetal rhythm abnormalities were
only observed during the last 15 minutes of expulsion. The 1-minute Apgar score was 4 and
the 5-minute Apgar score was 10. The newborn’s umbilical cord pH was 7.29, and lactate levels
were 4 mmol/L (normal range: 2.5 to 3.7 mmol/l [12]). These cases show that the degree of
head molding shown on MRI alone is not itself predictive of the type of delivery.
Bregmatic and lambdoid fontanelles presented a sharp reduction in their opening at the
middle brim in all fetuses during the second phase of labor compared with prelabor. This
deformation of the head suggests the shape of a "sugarloaf" (Figs 3 and 4).
Discussion
Progress beyond knowledge
Fetal head molding is known to occur sometime during birth, but imaging of this physiological
process has only been reported once [13]. All the fetuses imaged here demonstrated some
degree of fetal head molding on MRI, but only two of the seven kept a characteristic
Fig 5. Three-dimensional fetal brain MRI reconstruction before labor (shown in purple in A, C, E) and during the second stage of labor (shown in
orange in B, D, F). In all patients, the fetal brain was observed to change in shape in the second stage of labor. This change in fetal brain shape mirrored the
shifting of fetal skull bones observed during the second phase of labor.

 “sugarloaf”-shaped skull [14] on clinical exam after birth. These findings could be related to
different elasticities of the skull bones, the supporting fibrous structure, or the synchondroses
at the base of the skull. These MRI findings suggest that the fetus is subjected to greater stress
than previously thought, which could explain the high incidence of asymptomatic brain hem-
orrhages and retinal hemorrhages found after normal vaginal delivery [1,3,15–18]. The fact
that one of the children in our series showed the biggest deformation of its skull during the
birthing process, was born easily after only a few maternal efforts, and showed signs of fetal
distress despite continuous normal monitoring until the expulsion phase, raises the question
of the relevance of our actual definition of a normal birth. It is actually considered normal
childbirth when a parturient gives birth by natural means, with only a few maternal expulsive
efforts. This definition does not take into consideration the ability of the fetal head to deform
(compliance). If the fetal head’s compliance is high, the skull and brain may undergo signifi-
cant deformation as the birth canal is crossed, and the child’s condition at birth may not be
good. Consequently, childbirth should perhaps be considered normal when a parturient gives
birth naturally with only a few expulsive efforts, and her child is fine and has no consequences
due to the shape changes of its brain during the process.
Previous 3D biomechanical assessments of birth
Lapeer et al. [19] had simulated a fetal skull subjected to pressures exerted by the uterine cervix
during the first stage of labor using a non-linear model of deformation of the fetal skull. Our
study confirmed the molding of the fetal skull that was predicted by the Lapeer biomechanical
model, both in terms of its shape after deformation and the degree of deformation. These find-
ings highlight the critical role of cervical dilation on fetal head molding during the first stage of
labor. Our findings differed from those of Lapeer et al. in that we observed the parietal bones
sliding below the frontal bones. We found no correlation between fetal head rotation inside
the birth canal and parietal-frontal bone shifts. Further analysis is required to determine

 whether there is a correlation between various fetal cranial bone subluxations and the direction
of fetal head rotation. Buttin et al. [20] used a spherical model to study deformation of the fetal
head during delivery without cervical resistance. This model did not include factors critical to
delivery and was not corroborated by our findings.
A literature review found previous studies based on 3D biomechanical simulations of the
anatomy of the birthing process; but however, none had been based on imaging involving
actual patients and none had demonstrated opportunities for intervention during the process.
3D MRI imaging allowed us to better evaluate biomechanical phenomena occurring during
the birthing process and to diagnose the presence of multiple overlaps of the sutures. The eval-
uation of the degree of fetal head molding by imaging is an important issue to consider in cal-
culating the stiffness modulus of the fetal skull bones and the combined forces which lead to
this deformation. These observations allowed us to determine more accurate settings for our
computerized delivery simulation models and to better understand the limitations of 3D
modeling programs. The Predibirth software (Olivier Ami, France), [10,11] is a 3D post-pro-
cessing software using MRI, dedicated to studying the process of birth by cephalopelvic con-
frontation, with libraries of models and fetal behaviors inside the birth canal.
The greatest head molding was observed in two of the three fetuses that required C-section
for delivery. It is important to note that even when significant fetal molding occurs, the patient
might not have the ability to achieve an uncomplicated birth via vaginal delivery, as found in
patient 4. This patient had a Magnin score of 25 and an adequate pelvis for vaginal delivery.
However, the newborn had an Apgar score of 4 in the first minute of life, and emitted meco-
nium during the expulsion phase. The Apgar score quickly rose to 10 at 10 minutes of age, and
there was no metabolic acidosis. The role of ease of delivery and of fetal molding in this risky
clinical presentation is not clear.
Strengths
To our knowledge, this study is the first time a series of parturient women have been delivered
inside an MRI in a reproducible way, which allows us to consider performing further research
protocols in the future, with sequences both morphological and functional. MRI modalities
allowed us to observe soft tissues that are not correctly visible with ultrasound, and to put into
perspective the deformation of the skull, brain, and movement of maternal soft tissues around
them. We used high-performance sequences at 1 Tesla to obtain successful imaging in a mini-
mum of time with minimal discomfort, while maintaining a high level of safety, compatible
with obstetrics.
Limitations
For evident safety reasons, we limited our study to physiological labor during this protocol. To
explore pathological labor, the MRI machine should preferably be located inside the labor
ward. All MRI sequences are not suitable for such protocols, because some take too long to
perform. Given childbirth is a dynamic phenomenon, changes occur quickly over time, espe-
cially during uterine contractions and releases. Short sequences can be made between contrac-
tions, and dynamic sequences can be made on a small number of slices during contractions.
The main constraint was the availability of a dual team of maternity (obstetrician, pediatrician,
anesthetist, midwife, pediatric nurse) and radiology (radiologist, radio manipulator) 24 hours
a day, including a team dedicated to the protocol. We did not observe any fetal brain
impairment during or after delivery because the protocol did not include diffusion sequences
to detect ischemia or T1 FATSAT to observe the onset of hemorrhage.

 Conclusion and future studies
This study demonstrates the value of 3D MRI assessment using 3D finite elements mesh
reconstruction during the second stage of labor to reveal how the fetal brain is impacted by the
molding of the cranial bones. Fetal head molding was observed on MRI in all seven patients
during the second phase of labor. The cranial deformation observed on MRI was not observed
on clinical exam in five of the seven newborns. Overlapping of the cranial sutures was most
marked in the anterior-posterior direction, at the coronal and lambdoid suture. These findings
need to be confirmed in a larger series.
The observations made on the modeling capabilities of the fetal head and brain during the
second stage of labor also allow us to consider a more realistic simulation of delivery in order
to develop a virtual trial of labor that can detect and prevent biomechanical risks linked to
childbirth.
