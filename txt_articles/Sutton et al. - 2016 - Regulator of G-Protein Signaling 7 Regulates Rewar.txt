Abstract
 Background—Morphine mediates its euphoric and analgesic effects by acting on the μ-opioid 
receptor (MOR). MOR belongs to the family of G protein coupled receptors, whose signaling 
efficiency is controlled by the Regulator of G protein Signaling (RGS) proteins. Our understanding 
of the molecular diversity of RGS proteins that control MOR signaling, their circuit specific 
actions and underlying cellular mechanisms is very limited.
 Method—We used genetic approaches to ablate RGS7 both globally and in specific neuronal 
populations. We used conditioned place preference and self-administration paradigms to examine 
reward-related behavior and a battery of tests to assess analgesia, tolerance and physical 
dependence to morphine. Electrophysiology approaches were applied to investigate the impact of 
RGS7 on morphine-induced alterations in neuronal excitability and plasticity of glutamatergic 
synapses. At least 3 animals were used for each assessment.
 Results—Elimination of RGS7 enhanced reward, increased analgesia, delayed tolerance and 
heightened withdrawal in response to morphine administration. RGS7 in striatal neurons was 
selectively responsible for determining the sensitivity of rewarding and reinforcing behaviors to 
morphine, without affecting analgesia, tolerance and withdrawal. In contrast, deletion of RGS7 in 
dopaminergic neurons did not influence morphine reward. RGS7 exerted its effects by controlling 
morphine induced changes in excitability of medium spiny neurons in Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) 
and gating the compositional plasticity of AMPA and NMDA receptors.
 Conclusion—This study identifies RGS7 as a novel regulator of MOR signaling by dissecting 
its circuit specific actions and pinpointing its role in regulating morphine reward by controlling the 
activity of NAc neurons.

 INTRODUCTION
The mesolimbic system is a major reward circuit in the brain consisting of projections from 
the dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens 
(NAc) (1). The majority of the NAc is composed of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that 
serve as the central output of the circuit (2, 3). As a result, changes in the activity of the 
MSNs have profound impact on reward behavior (4). The activity of MSNs is controlled by 
multiple neurotransmitters, many of which are acting on their cognate G protein coupled 
receptors (GPCRs), located on various neurons in the circuit. One such prominent system 
with a profound role in regulating the mesolimbic pathway is the endogenous opioid system, 
which underlies rewarding effects driving behavioral reinforcement for drugs of abuse such 
as opiates, alcohol and cannabinoids (5, 6). Pharmacological and genetic studies have shown 
that the central role in mediating the rewarding effects belongs to the μ-opioid receptor 
(MOR), which also serves as a direct target for abused opiates such as morphine and heroin 
(7–9).
The canonical model of reward and motivational action of opiates is described by a 
dopamine-dependent mechanism whereby activation of MOR on the GABAergic 
interneurons in the VTA leads to their diminished activity and results in the disinhibition of 
the dopaminergic VTA neurons facilitating the regulation of MSNs by dopamine (10, 11). 
MOR is also present on dopaminergic VTA neurons, directly modulating their activity and 
thus possibly contributing to dopamine-dependent effects of opioids (12, 13). However, 
strong evidence also points to significant role of dopamine-independent mechanisms in 
mediating morphine reward (14). Indeed, the MOR is prominently expressed directly on the 
MSNs in NAc (15) where it is involved in morphine reward-driven behaviors (16). Thus, a 
more encompassing model is now emerging that suggests that multiple synaptic mechanisms 
are likely contributing to the MOR-mediated reward behavior.
At the molecular level, strength and duration of GPCR signaling are potently regulated by 
members of the Regulator of G-protein Signaling (RGS) family (17, 18). RGS proteins act 
as GTPase-activating proteins (GAP) for G protein Gα subunit, thereby promoting their 
deactivation to result in faster termination of GPCR signaling. More than 30 individual RGS 
proteins are differentially expressed across the brain and several RGS proteins have been 
previously implicated in the overall regulation of opioid actions (19). Identifying which 
individual RGS proteins regulate MOR signaling within a specific neuronal population may 
help to distinguish their contributions in vivo. However, examples of the differential 
contribution to behavioral effects with the circuit level specificity of their action are limited. 
Here, we identify a novel role of RGS7 acting postsynaptically in MSNs of the NAc to 
specifically control rewarding and reinforcing effects of opioids.

  MATERIAL AND METHODS
 Animals and Viral Mediated Gene Transfer
All studies were carried out in accordance with the National Institute of Health guidelines 
and were granted formal approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of 
the Scripps Research Institute. The generation of Rgs7−/− mice was described earlier (20). 
Conditional knockout mice were generated by crossing homozygous Rgs7loxP/loxP with 
heterozygous DATcre (B6.SJL-Slc6a3tm1.1(cre)Bkmn/J; Jackson Labs stock ID: 006660) or 
Rgs9cre mice (21) to generate Rgs7loxP/loxPDATcre and Rgs7loxP/loxPRgs9cre knockout mice 
and their wildtype littermate controls, Rgs7loxP/loxP mice. The Rgs9cre mice were bred with 
tdTomato reporter mice (B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm9(CAG-tdTomato)Hze/J; Jackson Labs stock 
ID 007909). Mice were housed in groups on a 12 hr light–dark cycle with food and water 
available ad libitum. Males aged 2–5 months were used for all experiments except for the 
hotplate analgesia experiments where female mice were utilized. Details are provided in 
Supplement 1.
 Western blotting and In Situ Hybridization
Western blotting was carried out according to published protocols (Supplement 1). For In 
Situ Hybridization ViewRNATM 2-plex In Situ Hybridization Assay (Panomics; Santa Clara, 
USA) was used (Supplement 1).
 Behavioral Tests
Standard behavioral paradigms were applied to assess locomotor activity, drug induced 
reward, analgesic effects of acute and repeated morphine treatment and physical withdrawal. 
Full description of all behavioral tests can be found in Supplement 1.
 Electrophysiology
Patch clamp recordings from ventral and dorsal striatal neurons in brain slices were used to 
measure neuronal excitability and determine AMPAR/NMDAR ratios in drug-naïve and 
morphine dependent mice. See Supplement 1 for a full description of protocols used.
 Data Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (Prism 6.0, GraphPad, San Diego, 
CA). Groups were compared using one- or two-way ANOVA or Student’s t-test where 
appropriate except for time-course experiments that used a repeated measures two-way 
ANOVA. Post hoc test consisted of Tukey’s or Bonferroni as appropriate.
 RESULTS
 RGS7 regulates a broad spectrum of behavioral responses to morphine
We began by examining RGS7 expression in the mesolimbic system focusing on the VTA 
and the NAc (Fig. 1A, D). Using in situ hybridization technique at a single-cell resolution, 
we found an abundance of RGS7 mRNA in the majority of neurons in the VTA (Fig. 1B, C) 
and in the NAc (Fig. 1E, F). Co-labelling studies revealed that RGS7 and MOR were co-

 expressed in the same neuronal populations in the VTA (Fig. 1B, C) and in the NAc (Fig. 
1E, F).
To study the role of RGS7 in regulating opiate action with circuit-level resolution we 
generated several mouse lines using a conditional Cre-loxP strategy. We started with the 
phenotypic evaluation of mice with the brain-wide deletion of RGS7 (Rgs7−/−) generated by 
crossing Rgs7loxP/loxP mice with a global germ-line EIIaCre-driver (Fig. 2A). Analysis of 
protein expression in the whole brain by western blotting, revealed no detectable RGS7 
protein in the Rgs7−/− mice, indicating that RGS7 is completely eliminated using this 
strategy (Fig. 2B). This manipulation did not affect the expression of other closely related 
RGS proteins RGS9-2 and RGS6 but significantly reduced levels of RGS7 subunits: Gβ5 
and R7BP (Fig. 2B).
To understand the overall contribution of RGS7 to opiate actions we performed behavioral 
characterization of Rgs7−/− mice. In the open filed, both Rgs7−/− mice and their wild-type 
littermates (Rgs7+/+) displayed similar habituation to novel environment (Fig. 2C). However, 
Rgs7−/− mice demonstrated significantly lower levels of spontaneous locomotor activity 
during initial exploratory phase compared with Rgs7+/+ mice (Fig. 2C) resulting in overall 
hypoactivity (Fig. 2D). Next, we examined the psychomotor activation of mice in response 
to morphine administration. Rgs7−/− mice showed increased sensitivity to morphine-induced 
locomotion, as these mutant mice showed enhanced locomotor activity at a lower dose than 
Rgs7+/+ mice (Fig. 2E). At a dose that caused increased locomotor activity in both 
genotypes (10 mg/kg), morphine induced a maximal response at the same time (30 min), and 
the effect lasted for the same duration (~160 min) in both genotypes (Fig. 2F). However, 
locomotor response in Rgs7−/− mice was enhanced as compared to Rgs7+/+ mice.
To assess possible changes in the rewarding effects of morphine, we used a place preference 
paradigm where mice are conditioned to prefer a drug-paired environment. Lack of RGS7 
increased the sensitivity to morphine reward as Rgs7−/− mice exhibited a significant place 
preference at 1 mg/kg that was not observed in Rgs7+/+ mice (Fig. 2G). As expected, a 
higher dose of morphine (10 mg/kg) induced comparable place preference in both Rgs7+/+ 
and Rgs7−/− mice. No difference between genotypes in distance traveled during the test 
period was observed at any of the doses of morphine used (Fig. 2H).
We next examined responses of mutant mice to morphine analgesia. In a hot plate test, 
Rgs7−/− and Rgs7+/+ mice exhibited comparable nociception threshold at a temperature of 
either 52°C or 56°C (Fig 3A). In contrast, following morphine treatment (5 mg/kg and 15 
mg/kg) Rgs7−/− mice showed a substantially enhanced analgesic response compared to its 
Rgs7+/+ controls (Fig. 3B). Pretreatment with naloxone, a MOR antagonist eliminated the 
analgesic effect of morphine in both genotypes. Furthermore, the duration of analgesic 
response to morphine (15 mg/kg) lasted longer in Rgs7−/− mice (Fig. 3C) as evidence by a 
significant decrease in morphine effectiveness at 90 min in Rgs7+/+ mice and 150 min in 
Rgs7−/− mice.
Repeated opiate use leads to tolerance and a physical dependence that manifests in 
withdrawal and drug craving. Tolerance was measured by monitoring the morphine response

 on the hotplate paradigm daily for 5 consecutive days. Rgs7−/− mice displayed a delayed 
tolerance to morphine compared with Rgs7+/+ mice over the time course but both genotypes 
developed tolerance to morphine (Fig. 3D). We further examined the dependence of animals 
on morphine during a chronic administration regimen by scoring symptoms of physical 
withdrawal upon injection of an opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone. Rgs7−/− mice display 
more severe withdrawal symptoms as weight loss, diarrhea, wet dog shakes, tremors and 
ptosis are significantly increased compared to Rgs7+/+ mice (Fig. 3E). Overall, these data 
show that mice lacking RGS7 exhibit enhanced rewarding and analgesic effects to morphine, 
greater dependence and delayed tolerance, thus demonstrating an essential role for RGS7 in 
opiate action.
 RGS7 in dopaminergic neurons does not influence morphine reward
In order to determine the neuronal population responsible for the effect of RGS7 on 
morphine reward, we first tested the behavioral consequences of RGS7 elimination in 
dopamine neurons, a major neural substrate for the rewarding actions of opiates. We crossed 
the Rgs7loxP/loxP mice with DATcre driver line that expresses Cre recombinase in 
dopaminergic neurons (Figure S1A,B in Supplement) and compared the resulting 
Rgs7loxP/loxPDATcre mice to their littermate controls Rgs7loxP/loxP. In naïve mice, 
Rgs7loxP/loxPDATcre and Rgs7loxP/loxP had similar locomotor activity habituation pattern in 
the open field (Figure S1C in Supplement). We further observed no differences in 
psychomotor activation between genotypes in response to morphine (Figure S1D in 
Supplement). Both genotypes showed an increase in locomotor activity to 10 mg/kg and 20 
mg/kg morphine injections as compared to saline. Finally, we examined rewarding effects of 
morphine in the place preference paradigm. Both Rgs7loxP/loxPDATcre and Rgs7loxP/loxP 
showed a significant place preference at 10 mg/kg but not at 1 mg/kg (Figure S1E in 
Supplement). No significant difference between the genotypes was observed for either 
morphine dose. These results indicate that dopaminergic neurons are not responsible for the 
effect of RGS7 on morphine-driven reward or psychomotor activation.
 RGS7 in striatal neurons regulates morphine reward and reinforcement but not 
psychomotor activation, tolerance or withdrawal
To explore the possibility that post-synaptic RGS7 in the mesolimbic pathway is responsible 
for morphine-reward driven behaviors, we targeted RGS7 in striatal neurons. This was 
achieved by crossing the Rgs7loxP/loxP mice with the striatal specific driver line Rgs9cre, 
where expression of Cre recombinase is restricted to post-synaptic neurons in the striatum 
(Fig. 4A,B; Figure S2 in Supplement). Evaluation of the resulting Rgs7loxP/loxPRgs9cre mice 
in the open field under drug-naïve conditions revealed no difference compared with their 
Rgs7loxP/loxP controls (Fig. 4C). Administration of morphine resulted in significant increases 
in locomotor activity in both genotypes at both 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg with no difference 
between the genotypes (Fig. 4D). Next we investigated the rewarding effects of morphine in 
a CPP paradigm and found that only Rgs7loxP/loxPRgs9cre mice showed a significant place 
preference towards the drug paired side at a low dose (1 mg/kg) of morphine (Fig. 4E). At a 
10 mg/kg dose both Rgs7loxP/loxP and Rgs7loxP/loxPRgs9cre exhibited a significant increase 
in time spent in the drug-paired side. At this higher dose, Rgs7loxP/loxRgs9cre mice again 
showed an increased preference for the morphine-associated chamber as compared to 
Sutton et al.

 Rgs7loxP/loxP littermates. Next, we determined the contribution of ventral striatum in the 
actions of RGS7 by viral approach. Delivering AAV virus expressing Cre recombinase, but 
not control GFP expressing AAV, to the NAc significantly enhanced the of Rgs7loxP/loxP 
mice for the morphine-paired chamber at 1 mg/kg (Fig. 4F). Overall, the CPP data shows the 
involvement of RGS7 in the NAc in the rewarding properties of morphine.
We further performed a series of behavioral assays evaluating analgesia, morphine tolerance 
and withdrawal because the neuronal population where RGS9cre driver is active has been 
previously shown to contribute to these behaviors (22). Rgs7loxP/loxPRgs9cre and 
Rgs7 loxP/loxP mice did not show any difference in nociceptive threshold in the hot plate test 
at either 52°C or 56°C (Fig. 4G). Furthermore, the analgesic responses to acute morphine 
administration were similar in both genotypes (Fig. 4H). Both Rgs7loxP/loxPRgs9cre and 
Rgs7loxP/loxP mice also developed similar tolerance to daily injections of 15 mg/kg morphine 
on day 3 (Fig. 4I). Neither did we find any differences in withdrawal upon naloxone-
precipitated morphine withdrawal (Fig. 4J). These findings suggest that rewarding properties 
of morphine are selectively affected by eliminating RGS7 in the striatum.
To confirm this conclusion we investigated the reinforcing properties of morphine using a 
morphine self-administration procedure which models drug reinforcing responses such as 
drug seeking and taking behavior. First, Rgs7loxP/loxPRgs9cre mice and their littermate 
controls were trained in a two-lever operant task to respond to food reward (Fig. 5A). While 
both genotypes learned food self-administration to the set criteria, the Rgs7loxP/loxPRgs9cre 
mice established this behavior earlier than their wild type littermates. Once responding for 
food reinforcement was established, mice were implanted with intravenous jugular catheters 
and assessed for lever pressing behavior that resulted in morphine infusions. Although both 
genotypes readily self-administered morphine at dose of 0.3 mg/kg/infusion, 
Rgs7loxP/loxPRgs9cre mice exhibited an increased number of active lever presses compared 
with Rgs7loxP/loxP mice with no change on inactive lever pressing (Fig. 5B). This experiment 
demonstrates that Rgs7 loxP/loxPRgs9cre mice have a greater sensitivity to the reinforcing 
effects of morphine. Analysis of the dose-response relationship revealed that 
Rgs7loxP/loxPRgs9cre mice earn a greater number of morphine infusions compared to 
Rgs7 loxP/loxP mice at doses of 0.3 and 0.6 mg/kg/infusion (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, while 
both genotypes responded with increased morphine intake at higher doses (mg/kg/session), 
there was still a significant genotype difference (Fig. 5D). This upward shift of the dose-
response relationship is thought to reflect the reinforcing effects of consumed morphine 
(23), supporting the hypothesis that deletion of RGS7 in striatum potentiates the rewarding 
effects of morphine thereby leading to an increase in morphine infusions.
 RGS7 gates morphine-induced changes in intrinsic excitability and synaptic properties 
of striatal neurons
To determine the mechanisms by which striatal RGS7 regulates the rewarding effects of 
morphine we examined changes in the biophysical properties of MSN neurons in the NAc 
by whole cell patch clamp recordings. In drug naïve mice, we found no difference in several 
measures of intrinsic neuronal properties (Fig. 6A). In the basal state, NAc neurons of 
Rgs7loxP/loxPRgs9cre mice and their Rgs7loxP/loxP littermates exhibited similar resting

 membrane potentials (RMPs), input resistance and firing patterns in response to current 
injection (Fig. 6A, C–E). Next, we compared the same neuronal properties in mice that 
established stable morphine intake in self-administration paradigm one day following the 
last reinforced session. In contrast to naïve subjects, intrinsic excitability of NAc neurons 
was significantly diminished in self-administering Rgs7loxP/loxPRgs9cre mice relative to their 
control littermates as evident from the reduction in the number of action potentials (Fig. 6B) 
and elevation in the firing threshold (Fig. 6C). There was no difference in the RMP or input 
resistance across the genotypes (Fig. 6D,E). Similar changes in electrical properties were 
observed when morphine injections (10 mg/kg for 7 days) were delivered by an investigator 
(Figure S3 in Supplement), indicating that differences in neuronal excitability resulted from 
morphine effects rather than circuit entrainment associated with an operant behavior. 
Interestingly, these alterations were specific to NAc and no changes in the properties of 
neurons in the dorsal striatum were seen (Figure S4 in Supplement). Overall, these data 
suggest that differences in MSN excitability between Rgs7loxP/loxP and Rgs7loxP/loxPRgs9cre 
mice emerged in response to morphine administration.
In addition to regulating excitability, drugs of abuse are known to influence synaptic 
properties of neurons in the reward circuit, thus contributing to long-term plasticity that 
ultimately underlies drug-taking behavior. Thus, we next examined the role of RGS7 in 
regulating the composition of postsynaptic glutamate receptors, a well-known form of 
synaptic plasticity at glutamatergic synapses, influenced by addictive drugs and reward 
states (24). Under basal, drug naïve conditions afferent stimulation evoked comparable 
EPSCs in both Rgs7loxP/loxP and Rgs7loxP/loxPRgs9cre neurons in NAc (Fig. 7A). Dissection 
of individual receptor components using pharmacological blockade strategy revealed that the 
response is mediated by approximately equal contributions of AMPA and NMDA receptors 
with no difference in AMPAR/NMDAR ratio between genotypes (0.96 ± 0.14, n = 7 for 
Rgs7loxP/loxP and 0.93 ± 0.13, n = 7 for Rgs7loxP/loxPRgs9cre). However, when measured in 
animals self-administering 0.3 mg/kg/infusion morphine, we detected a significant 
difference between the groups. Rgs7loxP/loxRgs9cre mice showed a significant increase in 
AMPAR/NMDAR ratio (1.5 ± 0.2, n = 6) as compared to Rgs7loxP/loxP littermates (1.1 ± 0.1, 
n = 9) when recorded one day following the last reinforced session (Fig 7B). Consistent with 
the post-synaptic nature of the manipulation with RGS7, we observed no change in the 
short-term pre-synaptic plasticity as evidenced examining paired pulse ratio (Fig 7C). 
Overall, these results suggest that loss of post-synaptic RGS7 selectively influences 
morphine-induced adaptation of intrinsic properties and glutamatergic receptor plasticity in 
NAc neurons.
 DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates that RGS7 acts as a negative regulator of acute and chronic 
morphine actions. The behavioral experiments show that the lack of RGS7 results in a 
greater sensitivity to the rewarding and analgesic effects of morphine, as well as an 
increased somatic withdrawal response. Our data further dissociate the contribution of RGS7 
within the neurons of the mesolimbic circuit specifically for reward and motivation. Using a 
conditional-knockout strategy, we report that RGS7 in the striatal MSNs but not in 
dopaminergic neurons of the midbrain regulates rewarding effects of morphine. We further

 found that RGS7 was responsible for regulating morphine-induced glutamate receptor 
plasticity in NAc neurons and that adaptation of their intrinsic excitability in response to 
morphine drives an increased motivation of mice to engage in drug-taking behavior.
RGS7 is a member of the R7 family of RGS proteins, which negatively regulates GPCR 
signaling via inhibitory G proteins of the Gi/o class. As a classical Gi/o-coupled receptor, 
MOR is expected to be influenced by RGS7 activity. Indeed, our direct biochemical 
measurements indicate that RGS7 can potently regulate MOR signaling to Gαi and Gαo in 
reconstituted cellular system (25). Thus, enhanced morphine effects seen in knockout mice 
reported in this study, as well as earlier observations that antisense knockdown of RGS7 in 
the mouse brain enhanced morphine analgesia (26) are consistent with the mechanism that 
RGS7 acts by attenuating MOR signaling via Gαi/o.
The results of the present study reveal an underappreciated complexity of MOR regulation in 
vivo, as it is becoming increasingly apparent that the function of this receptor is 
differentially shaped by several RGS proteins across different brain regions. In addition to 
RGS7, depletion of RGS4 and RGS9 in the NAc also lowers the threshold for the rewarding 
effects of morphine producing a similar leftward shift in the CPP paradigm (27–29). Despite 
the diversity of RGS proteins regulating MOR in the NAc, all three RGS proteins appear to 
play non-redundant function as loss of one cannot be compensated by others. Furthermore, 
elimination of individual RGS in NAc neurons produce distinct phenotypes. For example, 
elimination of RGS9-2, also results in a greater analgesia, delayed tolerance and more severe 
somatic withdrawal symptoms (22). The genetic strategy that we used in this study afforded 
a unique opportunity to compare related RGS proteins, RGS7 and RGS9-2 in the regulation 
of morphine responses in the same neuronal populations. Strikingly, elimination of RGS7 in 
the same NAc neurons selectively affects reward with no impact on nociception, tolerance or 
withdrawal, despite the observations that globally RGS7 is involved in controlling all of 
these behaviors. The observation that RGS7 and RGS9-2 while acting in the same neurons 
produce distinct behavioral profiles suggests the existence of mechanisms that specify RGS 
action on MOR at the molecular level. While more work needs to be done to clarify such 
mechanisms, the realm of possibilities includes differential interactions of RGS proteins 
with their auxiliary regulatory subunits (30) and/or assembly of selective complexes with the 
G protein subunits (31). These mechanisms may work separately or together to bias different 
signaling outcomes downstream from MOR activation.
Using an operant self-administration task we determined that RGS7 affects the rewarding 
aspects of drug taking and seeking behaviors as animals lacking RGS7 showed increased 
morphine intake. In addition, when tested in the food self-administration paradigm mice 
lacking RGS7 in the striatum responded to the food reward earlier than their wildtype 
littermates suggesting that RGS7 may have a role beyond morphine-reward responses. The 
opioid system plays a fundamental role in the hedonic responses to natural rewards as well 
as in the learning processes that mediate goal-directed actions (32). We do not think that 
accelerated acquisition of operant responses to food upon deletion of RGS7 is associated 
with enhanced learning, as we previously found that Rgs7−/− mice exhibit deficits in 
learning and memory (33). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that by controlling

 endogenous opioid signaling through MOR, striatal RGS7 may be also involved in 
regulating hedonic properties of natural rewards.
One of the major observations of this work is that RGS7 controls morphine induced 
adaptation in the activity and synaptic plasticity of NAc neurons. Drugs of abuse, including 
morphine are well known to produce a variety of changes including structural alterations in 
the morphology of dendritic spines, as well as functional adaptation of firing properties and 
synaptic plasticity (34). It is thought that collectively these neuroadaptive changes underlie 
the induction of the lasting modifications of the mesolimbic circuit responsible for 
rewarding and reinforcing effects of drugs that contribute to the development of drug 
addiction (35). One prominent form of such adaptive effects triggered by opioids in the 
striatum is modulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission (36). Ample evidence points to 
the extensive cross-talk between the opioid and glutamate systems through several 
mechanisms that include modulation of glutamate release (37, 38) and composition of 
postsynaptic AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptors (39). The common theme behind these 
alterations seems to be an increase in the synaptic strength of NAc neurons that occurs as a 
result of either potentiating AMPA or inhibiting NMDA receptors. This is typically reflected 
in the increase in the AMPA/NMDA receptor ratio, a commonly used measure of the 
synaptic grading (40). Changes in AMPAR/NMDAR ratio is a hallmark adaptation triggered 
by many addictive drugs linked to increased motivated drug seeking behavior or relapse (24, 
41). However, the mechanisms and molecular players that control the induction of this form 
of the synaptic plasticity are largely unknown. In this context, our observation that 
elimination of RGS7 specifically promotes the increase in AMPAR/NMDAR ratio induced 
by chronic morphine-taking behavior with no influence seen in the drug-naïve mice 
indicates that RGS7 gates the induction of this form of the synaptic plasticity. It is likely that 
RGS7 does so by controlling the extent of the G protein signaling by MOR, which leads to 
either enhanced inhibition of NMDA receptors or increased activity through AMPA 
receptors. Regardless of the exact mechanism, the use of selective genetic drivers allowed us 
to conclude that RGS7 acts directly in the postsynaptic striatal neurons in a cell autonomous 
manner without affecting the major dopaminergic input.
Another major adaptation caused by opioids is changes in neuronal excitability (42). Indeed, 
repeated morphine exposure induce a decrease in the intrinsic excitability of NAc neurons 
(43), while long-term withdrawal from repeated morphine elicits an increase intrinsic 
excitability of MSNs (44, 45). Consistent with these effects and the role of RGS7 in 
regulating the extent of G protein signaling by MOR, we find that elimination of RGS7 leads 
to a pronounced decrease in intrinsic excitability of NAc neurons in response to chronic 
morphine administration. Again, this effect was specifically induced by chronic morphine 
administration and not observed in naïve mice. While opioids appear to affect both intrinsic 
excitability and synaptic plasticity, it is not well understood how these effects are linked. 
Generally, molecular elements that affect excitability are located away from the synapse 
(e.g. voltage-gated ion channels and inward rectifiers), while AMPA and NMDA receptors 
adjust synaptic properties. Thus, RGS7 may contribute to regulation of two molecularly 
distinct processes associated with the activation of MOR receptors.

 Taken together, we show that RGS7 is responsible for the neuronal adaptation associated 
with rewarding and reinforcing effects of morphine by regulating intrinsic excitability and 
plasticity of synaptic glutamate receptors. These findings may provide a better

 Figure 3. Global knockout of RGS7 affects analgesia, tolerance and withdrawal responses to 
morphine
(A) Rgs7−/− mice have comparable nociceptive threshold at 52°C and 56°C in the hot plate
