Abstract
Purpose: There is a paucity of biomarkers to predict failure in
human papillomavirus–positive (HPVþ) oropharyngeal squa-
mous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) following curative therapy.
E6/E7 viral oncoproteins are constitutively expressed in HPVþ
tumors and highly immunogenic, resulting in readily detected
serum antibodies. The purpose of this study is to determine
whether serum E6 and E7 antibody levels can potentially serve
as a biomarker of recurrence in patients with HPVþOPSCC.
Experimental Design: We evaluated E6/E7 antibody levels in
patients with previously untreated, advanced stage (III, IVa-b),
HPVþOPSCC receiving definitive chemoradiation under a uni-
form protocol from 2003 to 2010. Baseline and longitudinal
serum samples were obtained from our archived repository.
E6/E7 serum levels were measured using a glutathione-S-trans-
ferase capture ELISA and quantified by approximating the area
under the dilution curve, and were analyzed using ANOVA and
linear mixed model for longitudinal analysis.
Results: We compared 22 HPVþOPSCC patients who devel-
oped recurrence with 30 patients who remained disease-free.
There were no differences in T classification, N classification,
disease subsite, or smoking status between the groups. In a
longitudinal
analysis,
recurrent patients
had
significantly
higher E6 and E7 serum antibody levels than the nonrecurrent
patients over the follow-up period (P ¼ 0.02 and P ¼ 0.002,
respectively). Patients who recurred had a lower clearance of
E7 antibody than patients who remained disease-free (P ¼
0.0016).
Conclusions: Patients with HPVþOPSCC whose disease recurs
have a lower clearance of E6 and E7 antibodies than patients who
do not have recurrence. The ratio of E7 antibody at disease
recurrence compared with baseline is potentially a clinically
significant measurement of disease status in HPVþOPSCC.

Introduction
Over the past three decades, the incidence of oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has steadily increased in the
United States (1, 2). With decline in tobacco consumption, this
increase in OPSCC is largely attributable to an increase in high-
risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection (3, 4). Patients with
HPV-positive OPSCC typically have a more favorable prognosis
than patients with HPV-negative OPSCC, with distinct oncologic
mechanisms and epidemiologic profiles associated with this
subtype of cancer (5–8).
Despite the better prognosis associated with HPV-positive
OPSCC, approximately 15% to 20% of patients still experience
treatment failure and succumb to their disease (9, 10). Many
groups have published on clinical risk factors related to disease
recurrence in HPV-positive OPSCC, including a combination of
advanced T and N classification (11), active smoking status (12),
and matted cervical lymph nodes (13, 14). However, there is a lack
of predictive biomarkers that can identify patients who will fail
standard therapy.
Previous studies have demonstrated that levels of pretreatment
serum antibodies against the HPV-related E6 and E7 oncoproteins
predict disease-free survival in HPVþ OPSCC, suggesting that a
highly immunogenic response to these proteins before treatment
can be readily detected and may provide insight to a patient's
immune status (15). However, the detection of E6 and E7 anti-
bodies in a post-treatment setting with longitudinal measure-
ments of E6/E7 antibody status is needed to understand the
dynamics of serum antibodies and survival in these patients.
Thus, the purpose of our study was to determine if serum E6 and

 E7 antibody levels can potentially serve as a biomarker of
recurrence in patients with HPVþ OPSCC. We hypothesized
that patients who develop recurrence will have higher pretreat-
ment serum antibody levels, and that antibody levels will
be persistently elevated after treatment when compared with
nonrecurrent patients.
Materials and Methods
Patient eligibility
All patients were treated under a uniform clinical protocol
[University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center (UMCC)
protocol 2002–2021], designed to evaluate the toxicity and
efficacy of weekly concomitant carboplatin and paclitaxel with
intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for advanced stage
(III, IV) OPSCC from 2003 to 2010. This study was approved by
the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board. Patients
were enrolled and informed consent was obtained for all patients.
Patients were eligible if they had previously untreated, advanced-
stage (III, IVa-b), pathologically confirmed OPSCC, were HPV
positive, and had serum samples available in the University of
Michigan Head and Neck Cancer Program biorepository.
Tumor staging was routinely performed by clinical examina-
tion and direct laryngoscopy in the operating room along with
pretreatment staging computed tomography (CT) or CT/positron
emission tomography (PET) correlation within 4 weeks prior to
starting treatment. All patients were staged based on the 2002
American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system. Patients
were excluded whether they had previous surgery or radiation
therapy to the upper aerodigestive tract or neck.
Patient population
There were 171 patients with advanced HPV-positive OPSCC
who were treated uniformly under this paradigm. Thirty patients
developed recurrence in this cohort, and 22 of 30 patients had
baseline serum available for analysis. A control group of 30
patients was selected from patients who were treated under the
same clinical protocol who did not recur after at least 2.5 years of
follow-up and had available serum. When compared with the
recurrent cohort, nonrecurrent patients who were selected for the
analysis were similar in age, T classification, N classification, and
tobacco status (Table 1). Baseline samples ranged from 26 days
prior to 63 days after diagnosis and were collected before starting
treatment. Longitudinal samples were obtained at 3 month inter-
vals for 24 months from date of diagnosis. The mean time to
recurrence (measured as time from end of treatment) within the
recurrent group was 13 months. Smoking status and other epi-
demiologic variables were determined by health history ques-
tionnaire administered at the time of diagnosis.
Treatment protocol
Radiation therapy was delivered using daily fractionated IMRT,
5 days per week over 35 fractions. The doses were 70 Gy at 2.0 Gy
per fraction to gross disease and then 59 to 63 Gy at 1.7 to 1.8 Gy
per fraction to low-risk and high-risk subclinical regions, respec-
tively. This was done concomitantly according to published
methods (16, 17). Chemotherapy consisted of weekly carboplatin
(area under the curve 1) by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes
and paclitaxel (30 mg/m2) by intravenous infusion over 1 hour.
HPV status determination
Isolation of DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tissue samples was performed using the QIAamp DNA FFPE
Tissue Kit (Qiagen). DNA concentration and purity were con-
firmed via NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).
HPV status was determined by an ultrasensitive method using
real-time competitive polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass
spectroscopy with separation of products on a matrix-loaded
silicon chip array, as previously described (18). In addition,
p16 staining was available for 49 of 52 patients and was positive
in all 49 patients.
Translational Relevance
Despite superior disease-specific and overall survival in
human papillomavirus–positive (HPVþ) oropharyngeal squa-
mous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), there is a distinct and non-
trivial subset of patients who respond poorly to treatment.
Biomarkers of recurrence are lacking in these patients, and
would potentially allow early detection and treatment of
recurrent disease. In this study, we are the first to report the
significance of serum E6 and E7 antibodies that are persistent
after treatment. Recurrent patients had significantly higher E6
and E7 serum antibody levels than the nonrecurrent patients,
and the ratio of E7 antibody at disease recurrence compared
with baseline is potentially a clinically significant measure-
ment of disease status. Regular monitoring of these antibody
levels from time of diagnosis may allow for earlier detection of
recurrent disease, which could improve overall survival and
expand treatment options for patients who develop recurrent
HPVþ OPSCC.

 E6/E7 antibody
Detection of E6 and E7 serum antibodies was performed using
a modified version of a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) capture
ELISA, as previously described and validated (19). Blood drawn
from patients was centrifuged at 1,500 � g for 15 minutes. The
resulting serum component was aspirated and stored in 0.5 mL
aliquots at �80�C. For the ELISA assay, wells were incubated at
4�C for 1 hour with 100 mL of purified GST-E6-Tag, GST-E7-Tag, or
GST-Tag recombinant antigens. The recombinant antigens had
been previously generated using high-quality genomic DNA
isolated from the commercially available HPV16 positive Ca Ski
cervical cancer cell line, which was submitted to the University of
Michigan Center for Structural Biology where full length coding
sequences for HPV 16-related E6 and E7 oncoproteins were
generated by PCR followed by large-scale purification. Simulta-
neously, human sera samples were serially diluted in assay diluent
containing 10 ng/mL of GST-Tag recombinant antigen and incu-
bated in conical tubes for 1 hour at 4�C to eliminate background
reactivity of serum components. Antigen-coated wells were then
incubated at room temperature for 1 hour with 100 mL of each of
the diluted and pre-incubated human sera samples in duplicate.
Wells were washed with PBS-T followed by 100 mL of a goat anti-
human IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugate antibody
(SC2453, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), diluted 1:20, 000 in assay
diluent to remove any unbound serum components and recom-
binant GST-Tag. 100 mL of Supersensitive Tetramethylbenzidine
Liquid Substrate for ELISA (T4444, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to
each well and allowed to incubate in the dark for 5 minutes at
room temperature. Absorbance readings for each well were mea-
sured at 450 nm. Absorbance readings for wells coated with the
GST-Tag recombinant peptide represented background reactivity
and were subtracted from the absorbance readings for specific
reactivity with the GST-E6-Tag and GST-E7-Tag for each serum
sample dilution. For antigen detection during optimization of
purified GST-E6-Tag, GST-E7-Tag, and GST-Tag plate coating, a
mouse monoclonal anti-SV40 KT3 Tag primary antibody
(SC58664, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at a 1:1,000
dilution in conjunction with a goat anti-mouse IgG HRP-conju-
gate secondary detection antibody (SC2005, Santa Cruz Biotech-
nology) at a 1:20,000 dilution.
Statistical analysis
This study was designed to test differences in E6 and/or E7
antibody levels between recurrent and nonrecurrent patients
with advanced stage, HPVþ OPSCC. Both overall level of antibody
and change over time between groups were explored. When
designing the study from the availability of samples (30 nonre-
current and 22 recurrent), we calculated the power to detect a
mean difference in E6/E7 of at least 1 SD to be >90% for a two-
sample t test, with that power being slightlyless because we use the
nonparametric Wilcoxon test. Other clinical characteristics of
interest were age, T classification, N classification and smoking
status at diagnosis. We also explored the type of recurrence
(locoregional versus distant). Smoking status was defined cate-
gorically as never, prior (quit >6 months before diagnosis), or
current use of cigarettes.
Serial dilutions of each serum sample were summarized for E6
and E7 antibody levels separately by approximating the area
under the dilution curve (AUDC). We performed standard bivar-
iate comparisons between E6 and E7 at baseline, at treatment
completion, and at the latest time point with clinical covariates
using Wilcoxon tests (categories: e.g., smoking, Stage III vs IV, T
classification, N classification, recurrence status) and Spearman
correlation coefficients (continuous measures: age).
Linear mixed effects models were used to analyze patterns
of longitudinal E6 and E7 antibody levels over time. Each
model included fixed effects for time and recurrence status.
Correlated measurements within subject were assumed to have
a compound symmetric correlation structure. The interaction
between time and recurrence was explored as well as T classi-
fication, N classification, and current smoking status in multi-
variable models. Separate models were analyzed for E6 anti-
body and E7 antibody. In addition, we derived a measure
of change from baseline level to last clinically relevant time
point for comparison of antibody clearance across recurrence
status groups by a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. We defined this
clinically relevant time point as the sample nearest recurrence
(within 3 months) for the recurrent group and last available
sample from follow-up for the nonrecurrent group. Important-
ly, the samples taken from the nonrecurrent patients for the
clinically relevant time point were drawn within a mean dif-
ference of 36.8 days from the recurrent samples as to not have
time bias as the cause of the decrease in antibody level. The
extent of antibody clearance was defined as the ratio of the
latest/pretreatment antibody level.
Results
E6/E7 baseline and 3 months post-CRT antibody measurements
Serum from a total of 52 patients was measured at baseline
and at 3 months post-CRT (22 recurrent and 30 nonrecurrent).
Lower levels of baseline E7 antibody were seen in current
smokers (P ¼ 0.05, Table 2). Larger tumors had lower baseline
E7 antibody levels (T3/4 vs. T1/2, P ¼ 0.016, Table 2) and there
was a trend for higher baseline E7 antibody levels by N
classification (N0 vs. N1/2 vs. N3, P ¼ 0.09, Table 2). There
was no association with pretreatment antibody levels and
recurrence (E6, P ¼ 0.61, E7, P ¼ 0.17). There was no associ-
ation between the type of recurrence (locoregional vs. distant)
and pretreatment E6 and E7 antibody levels.
We next characterized the association between E6 and E7
antibody levels in the immediate post-treatment (within 3
months of completing treatment) and the development of
recurrence. There was no association between 3 months
post-treatment antibody levels and recurrence (E6, P ¼ 0.23;
E7, P ¼ 0.27, Table 2), nor evidence of significantly different
clearance (ratio) between the recurrent and nonrecurrent
patients (E6, P ¼ 0.54; E7, P ¼ 0.38, Table 3). In addition,
there was no difference between the 3 months post-treatment
absolute antibody levels or clearance (ratio) when stratifying by
type of recurrence (locoregional vs. distant).
Longitudinal analysis of serum E6/E7 antibody levels
The change in E6/E7 antibody levels was analyzed over time
in a linear mixed model. Both recurrent and nonrecurrent
patients had decreases in antibody levels over time (P ¼ 0.01
and P ¼ 0.005 for E6 and E7, respectively). In addition, patients
who developed recurrence had significantly higher E6 and E7
antibodies than nonrecurrent patients (P ¼ 0.02 and P ¼ 0.002,
respectively, Table 4). When controlling for T classification, N
classification and smoking status in a multivariable linear mixed
model, patients who developed recurrence continued to have

 significantly higher E6 and E7 antibodies than nonrecurrent
patients (P ¼ 0.03 and P ¼ 0.001, respectively).
The finding that patients who develop recurrence have higher
E6 and E7 antibody levels in the linear mixed model was then
expanded to look for time points that were particularly predictive
of recurrence. This would allow a clinician to determine whether
there is a significant time point or change in antibody level that
could be used to determine whether a patient is at risk for
recurrence. Figure 1 shows E6 and E7 antibody levels with Lowess
curves fit to the recurrent and nonrecurrent groups separately. The
patterns observed support the results of the linear mixed model
that both E6 and E7 decline over time and that the recurrent group
has measurably higher E6 and E7 in serial measurements. A
vertical line at 13 months (day 390) in each plot was added and
represents the mean recurrence time among the recurrent patients.
Particularly, when measuring E7 antibody ratio over time,
patients who developed recurrence displayed an inflection point
in their serial measurements of E7 antibody before the average
recurrence time.
E6/E7 antibody clearance from pretreatment to recurrence
There were 17 patients who had serum samples pretreatment
and at a time-point near their recurrence. These recurrent patients
were compared with the 30 nonrecurrent patients with follow-up
samples. Samples used for recurrence were drawn within 3
months of clinical detection of recurrence and ranged from
1.5 months prior to 2.7 months after recurrence diagnosis. The
mean (range) time to recurrence was 13 months (3–28 months).
Samples taken from the nonrecurrent patients for the clinically
relevant time point were drawn within a mean difference of
36.8 days from the recurrent samples as to not have time bias
as the cause of the decrease in antibody level.
A quantification of the extent of antibody clearance was
defined as the ratio of the latest/pretreatment antibody level
(Table 3). Figure 2 shows E6 and E7 antibody clearance by
recurrent status. Patients who did not recur cleared more E7
antibodies at the latest time point than recurrent patients (P ¼
0.0016). The median amount of E7 clearance at last time point
measured for the recurrent and nonrecurrent patients was 30%
and 60%, respectively. We did not observe a statistically signif-
icant difference by recurrence status in E6 antibody clearance.
When stratifying by type of recurrence, patients who developed a
locoregional recurrence had less E7 antibody clearance than
patients who did not recur (P ¼ 0.004). We also saw this trend
for patients who developed a distant recurrence (P ¼ 0.06).
Discussion
Our study demonstrates that patients with advanced stage,
HPVþ OPSCC who recur have higher levels of E6 and E7 anti-
bodies with serial measurements. We also demonstrate that
recurrent patients clear less E7 antibodies than patients who do
not recur, and that the ratio of E7 antibody at the time of
recurrence compared with baseline appears to be an important
measure of recurrence in this patient population. The pattern of
decline in E7 antibody relative to individual baseline shows

 promise as an important measure to consider when monitoring
patients for recurrence after treatment. This is the first study to
report the significance of the clearance of E6 and E7 antibodies
after treatment, and these biomarkers have the potential to
identify patients at risk of treatment failure.
Despite the superior overall survival and recurrence out-
comes in HPVþ OPSCC, there is a distinct and nontrivial subset
of patients (15%–20%) who respond poorly to treatment.
Although we have tools to diagnose a recurrence, we do not
have predictive biomarkers to anticipate a recurrence. Matted
nodes on the pretreatment imaging have been shown to confer
an increased risk for distant metastasis but are not useful for
monitoring for disease recurrence (13, 14). Because recurrent
disease in HPVþ OPSCC often recurs at distant sites and is
associated with a high mortality rate, it is important to develop
predictive biomarkers to detect recurrence post-definitive ther-
apy. Ultimately, detecting recurrent disease earlier in these
patients may allow for earlier and novel interventions aimed
at improving survival.
We investigated the utility of HPV E6 and E7 antibody testing as
a screening modality for tumor recurrence in HPVþ OPSCC
patients. Our findings are suggestive of a novel biomarker (E7
antibody clearance) as a useful screening tool for recurrent disease
in these patients. In addition, given the ease of a liquid biopsy for
cancer (blood draw), it may afford an opportunity for more
comprehensive tumor recurrence monitoring.
Fakhry and colleagues (15) have previously examined the
role of E6 and E7 antibody levels in 60 patients with
HPVþOPSCC patients. In agreement with our data, their group
also showed declining levels of E6 and E7 antibody level over
time after the completion of treatment. In this cohort, only 6
patients recurred, limiting the power to detect an association,
but showed higher baseline levels of E6 antibody in recurrent
patients compared to the nonrecurrent patients. They failed to
show differences in antibody levels between recurrent and
nonrecurrent patients in a longitudinal analysis. The important
difference in our study is that longitudinal analysis in this
nested case–control study allowed us to demonstrate associa-
tions between recurrence and pattern of E7 antibody clearance.
We believe these findings could contribute to improved sur-
veillance in the post treatment period. In addition, locoregional
failures seemed to be better predicted by our assay (E7 clear-
ance, P ¼ 0.004), which has the potential for future treatment
(surgery, re-irradiation) options as salvage therapy.
Other investigations into predictive biomarkers of recurrence in
HPVþ OPSCC have been limited to predictors of HPV status
(20, 21), or use of single time point of pretreatment biomarkers
(22). The examination of post-treatment oral rinses by Rettig and
colleagues (23) has specific merit, as this study showed the ability
to detect HPV16 DNA in the oral rinses of 5 patients who
developed recurrence of their cancer. They showed high specificity
for local disease recurrence (median time from earliest post-
treatment detection to recurrence: 7 months), suggesting that this
biomarker be used in subsequent surveillance protocols. One
limitation is that patients who develop regional or distant disease
did not have HPV16 in their oral rinses, which may be a limitation
to this technique.
The biological importance of circulating antibodies against
HPV E6 and E7 has scientific merit. Maintenance of elevated
antibody levels may correlate with a continued source of immu-
nogenicity (e.g., an active tumor), or defects in the immune
system's ability to clear tumor. If an HPVþ tumor (and thus HPVþ
E6/E7 tumor antigen) is cleared, there is no continued immuno-
genic driver for a host's immune system to continue to make
E6/E7 antibodies. As a result, patients who have cleared their
disease would have a drop in E6/E7 antibodies whereas those with
persistent or recurrent disease may have continued generation of
E6/E7 antibodies.
Of note, smoking status appears to have an effect on circulating
E6/E7 antibody levels. Whether smokers with HPVþ OPSCC
comprise a distinct immunogenic and prognostic population has
been highly investigated (6). There may be confounding factors in
this population as it may be difficult to ascertain the underlying
primary driver in HPVþ tumors in smokers (survival for HPVþ
smokers is between those of HPVþ non-smokers, and HPV�

recurrence at approximately 200 days, which occurred before the detection of
their recurrence.

 smokers). Further elucidation into the potential confounding
effect of smoking needs to be performed.
There are a few considerations in interpreting these data. Our
cohort size is limited, and although samples were collected in a
prospective manner, the study design is retrospective in nature
and requires prospective analysis. In addition, we only enrolled
patients with Stage III/IV disease in this prospective clinical trial,
so patients with T1/2 without cervical metastasis would not be
included. This finding will need to be validated in early stage I/II
HPVþ OPSCC. Further validation of our E6/E7 antibody detection
methods should be performed to determine the reproducibility
and large-scale applicability of this assay across blood samples of
varying quality and age. Nevertheless, we believe these prelimi-
nary findings suggest a potential novel and valuable screening
tool for HPVþ OPSCC cancer patients. A larger HPVþ cohorts,
involving multiple institutions and accounting for potential con-
founders (e.g., smoking status), will be crucial to determine the
utility of E7 antibody clearance as a predictive biomarker. Given
this data, a prospective study would be possible with as few as 100
patients to detect a mean difference in E6/E7 levels of at least 1 SD
with a power of >90% for a two-sample t test assuming a 15%
recurrence rate in the cohort.
Patients with HPVþ OPSCC whose disease recurs have higher
E6 and E7 antibodies in serial measurements. Recurrent patients
clear less E7 antibodies than patients who have lived at least
2.5 years without a recurrence. The ratio of E7 antibody at disease
recurrence compared with baseline appears to be a clinically
significant measurement of disease status. These findings merit
validation in a prospective clinical trial.
