Background. Infection is the most important cause of treatment-related morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients treated 
for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Although routine in adults with leukemia, antibacterial prophylaxis is controversial in 
pediatrics because of insufficient evidence for its efficacy or antibiotic choice and concerns about promoting antibiotic resistance 
and Clostridium difficile infection.
Methods. This was a single-center, observational cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed ALL, comparing prospectively 
collected infection-related outcomes in patients who received no prophylaxis, levofloxacin prophylaxis, or other prophylaxis during 
induction therapy on the total XVI study. A propensity score–weighted logistic regression model was used to adjust for confounders.
Results. Of 344 included patients, 173 received no prophylaxis, 69 received levofloxacin prophylaxis, and 102 received other 
prophylaxis regimens. Patients receiving prophylaxis had longer duration of neutropenia. Prophylaxis reduced the odds of febrile 
neutropenia, likely bacterial infection, and bloodstream infection by ≥70%. Levofloxacin prophylaxis alone reduced these infections, 
but it also reduced cephalosporin, aminoglycoside, and vancomycin exposure and reduced the odds of C. difficile infection by >95%. 
No increase in breakthrough infections with antibiotic-resistant organisms was seen, but this cannot be excluded.
Conclusions. This is the largest study to date of antibacterial prophylaxis during induction therapy for pediatric ALL and the 
first to include a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone. Prophylaxis prevented febrile neutropenia and systemic infection. Levofloxacin 
prophylaxis also minimized the use of treatment antibiotics and drastically reduced C. difficile infection. Although long-term anti-
biotic-resistance monitoring is needed, these data support using targeted prophylaxis with levofloxacin in children undergoing 
induction chemotherapy for ALL.

Infections remain the most frequent cause of serious treat-
ment-related morbidity and mortality in children and adoles-
cents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); currently, up to 
4% of children with ALL die of infection [1–4]. Even nonfatal 
infections can result in permanent end-organ damage, contrib-
ute to chemotherapy delay or modification, and increase anti-
biotic exposure [5]. Most serious infections occur during the 
relatively short induction phase of chemotherapy [2].
Primary antibacterial prophylaxis during chemotherapy-re-
lated neutropenia in adults reduces clinically documented 
infection, microbiologically documented infection, and infec-
tion-related mortality [6]. The US National Comprehensive 
Cancer Network recommends antibacterial prophylaxis with 
levofloxacin, a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone, for adult 
patients with acute leukemia. In addition, findings of animal 
studies suggesting that colonization with Clostridium difficile 
might be reduced by replacing β-lactam antibiotics with fluoro-
quinolones [7] are intriguing because hospital-acquired C. dif-
ficile infection is associated with a 6.7-fold increase in the odds 
of mortality in hospitalized children [8]. However, no clinical 
studies have shown that fluoroquinolone prophylaxis can pre-
vent C. difficile infection in high-risk patients.
In the pediatric ALL population, primary antibacterial 
prophylaxis is controversial, because data supporting its efficacy 
and safety are sparse. There are 2 published studies of antibac-
terial prophylaxis with fluoroquinolones for pediatric ALL. An 
unadjusted retrospective analysis, from Saudi Arabia, reported 
reduced bloodstream infection (BSI) and other infections with 
ciprofloxacin prophylaxis during delayed intensification [9]. 
However, a randomized controlled trial of ciprofloxacin proph-
ylaxis during induction therapy in Indonesia found a marked 
increase in the risk of fever, BSI, and death [10]. No published 
studies to our knowledge conducted in the pediatric population 
have evaluated the use of broad-spectrum fluoroquinolones 
(which may have greater efficacy than narrow-spectrum agents

such as ciprofloxacin), compared fluoroquinolones with other 
prophylaxis regimens, or assessed the impact of antibacterial 
prophylaxis on C. difficile infection. The current study aimed 
to identify the effects of antibacterial prophylaxis during induc-
tion therapy for pediatric ALL on antibiotic exposure, infection, 
and febrile neutropenia, and on C. difficile infection.
METHODS
This was an observational cohort study of patients receiving 
induction therapy for newly diagnosed ALL. Infection-related 
adverse event data were collected prospectively by the study team 
and evaluated by cross-referencing with the electronic medical 
record and institutional microbiology and pharmacy databases. 
Data describing prophylaxis prescribing and antibiotic expo-
sure were collected retrospectively. The study was approved by 
the St Jude Children’s Research Hospital Institutional Review 
Board (XPD04-070).
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Eligible for inclusion were all patients enrolled in the total XVI 
study for newly diagnosed ALL (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: 
NCT00549848) at St Jude Children’s Research Hospital from the 
opening of the trial (29 October 2007) who completed induc-
tion therapy before 6 January 2016. Similarly to a previous 
study, total XV [11], induction therapy was administered over 
42 days and comprised 4 weeks of prednisone, 4 doses of weekly 
vincristine, 2 doses of weekly daunorubicin, and 1 or 2 doses 
of PEG-asparaginase, followed by 2 weeks of cyclophospha-
mide, cytarabine, and thioguanine, plus intrathecal chemother-
apy according to risk category (Supplementary Table S1). The 
induction phase could be modified or prolonged in response to 
infection or other complications. Participants with clinically or 
microbiologically documented infection before induction ther-
apy initiation or who had fever before induction therapy requir-
ing prolonged antibiotic therapy (>4 days) were excluded from 
this analysis to avoid misclassification of antibacterial treatment 
as prophylaxis. Similarly, patients who developed febrile neutro-
penia or suspected infection during the first 7 days of induction 
or after <2 days of neutropenia were excluded because there was 
insufficient opportunity to initiate primary prophylaxis.
Definition of Primary Prophylaxis
Primary prophylaxis was defined as the administration of sys-
temic antibacterial agents during induction therapy, before the 
first episode of suspected or proven infection or febrile neutro-
penia, with the intent to prevent infection. Appropriate peri-
operative or Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis and empiric 
short courses of antibiotic given for fever at presentation or 
for clinical events other than infection or febrile neutropenia, 
such as vomiting, headache, or vertigo, were not considered 
prophylaxis. From 2007 until July 2014, antibacterial prophy-
laxis was provided at the discretion of the treating clinician. It 
typically consisted of cefepime, ciprofloxacin, or vancomycin 
plus cefepime or ciprofloxacin and was initiated after the first 
documented neutropenia after chemotherapy. From August 
2014, institutional guidelines recommended levofloxacin 
prophylaxis during all episodes of neutropenia expected to last 
≥7 days.
Management of Febrile Neutropenia and Suspected Infection
The recommended febrile neutropenia treatment was cefepime 
(or ceftazidime plus vancomycin if cefepime was unavailable), 
with addition of vancomycin or an aminoglycoside for speci-
fied indications [12, 13] and substitution of meropenem for 
cefepime in patients who had recently received cefepime or had 
suspected intra-abdominal or Bacillus cereus infection [13]. 
These guidelines did not change during the study period.
Definitions Related to Infection
The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, ver-
sion 3.0 [14], were used to capture all infection-related adverse 
events in the study database, and standard definitions were used 
to further categorize episodes (Table 1). Antibiotic exposure 
was quantified as “antibiotic days,” “specific antibiotic days,” 
and “cumulative antibiotic exposure.” Antibiotic days were cal-
culated for each patient as the simple proportion of induction 
days on which ≥1 systemic antibacterial antibiotic was admin-
istered (excluding Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis), and 
specific antibiotic days were calculated as the proportion of 
induction days on which a specific antibiotic was administered 
(cefepime and ceftazidime were combined). Cumulative antibi-
otic exposure was calculated as the sum of all specific antibiotic 
days divided by the number of induction days, accounting for 
the potential additive effect of coadministered antibiotics.
Statistical Methods
Fisher’s exact test was used to compare proportions, and 
Kruskal-Wallis or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests were used to 
compare medians. Associations between primary antibacterial 
prophylaxis and clinical outcomes were assessed using multiple 
logistic regression, and Firth’s penalized likelihood approach 
was used to address the problem of complete separation [20]. 
Propensity to receive prophylaxis was estimated with a multi-
nomial logistic regression model including age, sex, race, Down 
syndrome, and leukemia type as predictors. Then, a logistic 
regression model was used to model prophylaxis groups and 
duration of profound neutropenia as predictors, with inverse 
probability weighting based on the propensity score. Kaplan-
Meier estimates of disease-free survival were used to graph the 
time to first event for infection events in prophylaxis groups 
and were compared using the log-rank test. Statistical analysis 
was performed with SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute), and differ-
ences were considered significant at P < .05 (2 tailed). No power 
calculation was performed.

RESULTS
Of 505 patients assessed for eligibility, 161 were excluded because 
of the onset of suspected infection before induction therapy 
 
(n = 64), within the first 7 days of induction (n = 41), or after <2 
days of neutropenia (n = 19), or because of fever at presentation 
requiring prolonged treatment (n = 37). Of the remaining 344 
patients, 173 received no primary prophylaxis, 69 received levo-
floxacin prophylaxis, and 102 received other prophylaxis (Table 
2 and Supplementary Figure S1). Other prophylaxis regimens 
comprised cefepime, ciprofloxacin, or vancomycin plus cefepime 
or ciprofloxacin (Supplementary Table S2). The median dura-
tions of neutropenia and profound neutropenia were longer in 
patients receiving prophylaxis (Table 2), so duration of profound 
neutropenia was included with propensity score in multivariate 
analyses. Analyses related to C. difficile infection also included 
duration of meropenem exposure, because this drug was tar-
geted by antimicrobial stewardship interventions.
Total antibiotic days and cumulative antibiotic exposure were 
significantly increased in patients who received prophylaxis 
(P < .001) (Figure 1). The pattern of antibiotic use in patients 
receiving levofloxacin differed from that in patients receiving 
no prophylaxis; levofloxacin exposure increased, but there was 
a concomitant reduction in exposure to cefepime/ceftazidime, 
vancomycin, meropenem (P < .001 for all comparisons), and 
aminoglycosides (P = .002) (Figure 1).
Table 3 shows the incidence of infection-related adverse events 
in this population. After adjustment for other covariates, patients 
receiving any antibacterial prophylaxis were significantly less 
likely than those receiving no prophylaxis to have febrile neu-
tropenia, clinically documented infection, microbiologically 
documented infection, enterocolitis, C. difficile infection, likely 
bacterial infection, or BSI (Table 4) [12]. Reductions in C. difficile 
infection and enterocolitis occurred only in patients receiving 
fluoroquinolone prophylaxis; patients receiving cefepime-based 
prophylaxis had a higher risk of both (Supplementary Figure S2 
and Supplementary Table S3). Multiple logistic regression analy-
sis (Supplementary Table S4) and Kaplan-Meier analysis showed 
similar results (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S3).
Levofloxacin prophylaxis alone was associated with a sim-
ilar, statistically significant reduction in febrile neutropenia, 
microbiologically documented infection, and likely bacterial 
infection. (Table 5) There was also significantly less enterocolitis 
and C. difficile infection (Table 5). Multiple logistic regression 
analysis (Supplementary Table S4) and Kaplan-Meier analysis 
showed similar results (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S4).
Compared with patients receiving other prophylaxis reg-
imens, patients receiving levofloxacin prophylaxis had a simi-
lar risk of febrile neutropenia, clinically documented infection, 
microbiologically documented infection, likely bacterial infec-
tion, and BSI (Table 5). However, levofloxacin prophylaxis was 
associated with a significantly lower rate of C. difficile infec-
tion (adjusted odds ratio, 0.04; 95% confidence interval, <.01 to 
.36; P < .001) (Table 5). There was some heterogeneity among 
alternative regimens: Pooled ciprofloxacin-based regimens, 
predominantly ciprofloxacin plus vancomycin, seemed to be 
superior for some outcomes, but no individual regimen was 
significantly superior to levofloxacin (Supplementary Figure S2 
and Supplementary Table S3). Multiple logistic regression analy-
sis (Supplementary Table S4) and Kaplan-Meier analysis (Figure 
2 and Supplementary Figure S4) again showed similar results.

There were 28 episodes of bacterial BSI in 28 patients dur-
ing the study period (Supplementary Table S5). Although BSI 
was less common in patients receiving prophylaxis, the caus-
ative organisms were similar (Supplementary Table S5), and 
the proportions of BSI episodes complicated by severe sepsis 
or requirement for urgent intervention did not differ between 
patients receiving prophylaxis and those receiving none (2 of 9 
[22.2%] vs 4 of 19 [21.1%], respectively; P > .99). One patient 
receiving levofloxacin prophylaxis developed bacteremia caused 
by an extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Escherichia 
coli strain that was resistant to levofloxacin and cefepime.
DISCUSSION
In this largest study to date, primary antibacterial prophylaxis 
during induction therapy for ALL was associated with markedly 
reduced rates of febrile neutropenia, clinical or microbiologi-
cally documented infection, likely bacterial infection, and BSI. 
Although prophylaxis increased overall antibiotic exposure, 
patients receiving levofloxacin prophylaxis had less exposure 
to cefepime/ceftazidime, vancomycin, and aminoglycosides. 
Unexpectedly, prophylaxis with levofloxacin drastically reduced 
the risk of C. difficile infection and all-cause enterocolitis.
The observed reduction in infection and febrile neutropenia 
extends data obtained from adult populations. A meta-analysis 
of antibacterial prophylaxis in predominantly adult patients 
showed that prophylaxis reduced febrile episodes, documented 
infection, infection-related mortality, and all-cause mortal-
ity [6]. Few studies of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis in children 
with leukemia have been published; most showed a reduc-
tion in infection-related adverse events [9, 21–24], but some 
showed a paradoxical increase in these complications [10, 25]. 
Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis can also reduce 
bacterial infection [26] but was routine in all groups in this study.
The current study provides new information by comparing 
prophylaxis with levofloxacin, a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone, 
to alternative prophylaxis regimens and by excluding patients who 
had no opportunity to receive prophylaxis, carefully controlling 
for potential confounders and examining C. difficile infection. 
Our study has several strengths related to the institutional setting 
and study design. All patients were treated according to a single 
protocol at a single institution and were provided with high-qual-
ity supportive care [2, 27, 28]. We used prespecified standard 
definitions of febrile neutropenia, clinically or microbiologically 
documented infection (which includes nonbacterial infections), 
and BSI [15]. We added the category of likely bacterial infection, 
comprising infections typically attributed to bacteria. 
Patients with early infection or febrile neutropenia were 
excluded from analysis because they might falsely raise the

apparent rate of infection in the no-prophylaxis group. Similarly, 
excluding patients who had an infection before receiving 
chemotherapy or who received prolonged treatment for fever 
at presentation ensured that only potentially preventable out-
comes were analyzed. Not all patients with fever at presentation 
were excluded, because fever occurs in about 59% of patients 
and is rarely related to infection [29]. Detailed chart review 
ensured appropriate classification of prophylaxis regimens. 
Although observational studies of this type can be subject to 
selection bias, we aimed to ameliorate such bias by applying a 
propensity score–weighted logistic regression model to account 
for differences between groups.
The observed reduction in enterocolitis and C. difficile infec-
tion associated with levofloxacin prophylaxis is important 
because these conditions can cause serious illness, malnutri-
tion, chemotherapy delay, or poor absorption of medications 
for cancer treatment, all of which can reduce the chance of 
cure [8, 30–33]. Furthermore, 2 studies found that C. difficile 
infection in hospitalized children markedly increased the risk 
of all-cause mortality [8, 34]. Patients receiving levofloxa-
cin prophylaxis were protected from this infection, despite an 
incongruous increase in their total antibiotic exposure [30, 32]. 
A recent study in children with ALL found that exposure to 
antipseudomonal cephalosporin and β-lactam antibiotics, espe-
cially cefepime, was the most important contributor to the risk 
of C. difficile infection, but this study did not assess the effects 
of quinolone exposure [30]. 
In an animal model, fluoroquinolone antibiotics did not 
impair resistance to colonization with C. difficile, whereas 
β-lactam antibiotics did [7]. Therefore, using fluoroquinolone 
prophylaxis to reduce exposure to other antibiotics might pre-
vent C. difficile infection, but this is the first study to show such 
a benefit. Previous studies of quinolone prophylaxis in adults 
showed no such effect on C. difficile infection [6], and some 
studies have even identified fluoroquinolone exposure as a risk 
factor for C. difficile infection [35]. The difference in the cur-
rent study may be related to the marked reduction in the use 
of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy or to predominance of 
quinolone-susceptible C. difficile [2, 35]. 
Other potentially confounding variables that affect the risk of 
C. difficile infection in children with leukemia include shorter 
hospital stay and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor admin-
istration [36], but there was no change in discharge guidelines 
during the study period, and granulocyte colony-stimulating 
factor was not used in this protocol. Importantly, the institu-
tional rate of C. difficile infection did not change during the 
Figure 1. Antibiotic exposure during induction for each antibiotic prophylaxis group. Data are shown in a box plot; each box plot illustrates the upper and lower quartile 
(box), median (line inside box), adjacent values (whiskers), and outliers (open circles). Antibiotic exposure and cumulative antibiotic exposure were significantly greater in 
patients receiving levofloxacin or other prophylaxis than in those receiving no prophylaxis (P < .001 for all comparisons). However, patients receiving levofloxacin prophylaxis 
had less exposure to cefepime/ceftazidime, vancomycin, meropenem, or aminoglycosides (data not shown) when compared with those receiving no prophylaxis (P < .001, 
 
P < .001, P < .001, and P = .002, respectively) or other prophylaxis (P < . 001, P < .001, P < .001, and P = .04, respectively).

study period (Supplementary Figure S5). The effect of prophy-
laxis during induction on C. difficile infection in postinduction 
chemotherapy cannot be determined from this study.
The study has some limitations. Grouping alternative 
prophylaxis regimens provides a robust comparison group 
but can mask differences between heterogeneous regimens 
(Supplementary Figure S2 and Supplementary Table S3). The 
study was not powered to detect a difference in outcomes 
between different fluoroquinolones, and the reduction in C. 
difficile infection was seen in both levofloxacin and ciproflox-
acin-based prophylaxis regimens (Supplementary Table S3). 
Until 2014, antimicrobial prophylaxis was provided at the 
discretion of the treating physician, so the potential for con-
founding is an important issue, especially in the context of a 
single-center study, which can amplify the effects of confound-
ers. Clinicians may have preferentially prescribed prophylaxis 
to patients at higher risk of infection, but this confounding by 
indication would be expected to mask, rather than inflate, the 
benefits of prophylaxis. 
Other than neutropenia duration, risk factors for infection 
did not differ significantly between groups (Table 2); known 
variables were addressed by a propensity score–weighted mul-
tivariate logistic regression analysis (Tables 4 and 5). Another 
potential confounder is the time period, because routine lev-
ofloxacin was introduced in 2014 and the other groups were 
treated in 2008–2014. There is no evidence that this explains 
the differences between groups, because there were no trends 
in infection rates in study patients who received no proph-
ylaxis before 2014 (Supplementary Figure S6) and no sig-
nificant decrease in institutional rates of hospital-acquired 
infection or C. difficile infection during the entire study period 
(Supplementary Figure S5). 
Antimicrobial stewardship interventions introduced dur-
ing the study period included prospective audit with feedback 
for meropenem and linezolid use; however, no intervention 
aimed at reducing the use of vancomycin, cefepime/ceftazi-
dime, or aminoglycosides. Meropenem exposure was included 
as a covariate in the analysis of C. difficile infections to reduce

aThe propensity score of prophylaxis groups was estimated using a multinomial logistic regression model with age, sex, race, Down syndrome, and leukemia type as predictors; a logistic 
regression model was then used to model prophylaxis groups and exposure to profound neutropenia during induction as predictors of clinical outcomes, with inverse probability weighting 
using the propensity score.

the risk of confounding by these stewardship interventions. In 
2015, a 2-month nationwide shortage of cefepime necessitated 
a temporary modification of institutional guidelines to include 
ceftazidime plus vancomycin as first-line therapy for febrile 
neutropenia. Accordingly, ceftazidime and cefepime exposure 
were merged in the final analysis to avoid a spurious reduction 
in cefepime exposure during the shortage. Despite these efforts 
to address and ameliorate the effects of identified variables, 
confounding of the study by unidentified variables remains 
possible.
The prolonged neutropenia in patients receiving proph-
ylaxis might be related to the indication for prophylaxis 
and was, therefore, included in the multivariate analysis. 
However, a lower neutrophil nadir was seen in an Indonesian 
study of children receiving ciprofloxacin prophylaxis, raising 
the possibility of neutropenia as an adverse effect of fluoro-
quinolones [10]. A related consideration is that infection-re-
lated mortality during leukemia therapy is more common 
in low-income countries and malnourished patients, so our 
findings may not be generalizable to those settings [10].
The implementation of antibacterial prophylaxis has 
been limited by concerns regarding possible adverse conse-
quences, especially the development of antibiotic resistance 
[37]. Although antibiotic-resistant infections did not signifi-
cantly increase in this study, the sample size and time period 
were inadequate to measure the medium- or long-term risk. 
Studies of antibacterial resistance after levofloxacin proph-
ylaxis have yielded mixed results. A meta-analysis found 
no significant increase in quinolone-resistant infection 
(relative risk, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, .8–1.7), but the 
Figure 2. Kaplan-Meier analysis of time to infectious complications during induction for each antibiotic prophylaxis group. Patients receiving levofloxacin prophylaxis dur-
ing induction therapy for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia had a lower cumulative incidence of C. difficile infection (A) than those receiving no prophylaxis (P = .008) or 
other prophylaxis regimens (P = .01) and a lower cumulative incidence of enterocolitis (B) than those receiving no prophylaxis (P = .03). Patients receiving any prophylaxis had 
a lower cumulative incidence of febrile neutropenia (C) (P < .001) and likely bacterial infection (D) (P < .001), but there was no significant difference in the cumulative incidence 
of febrile neutropenia or likely bacterial infection between patients receiving levofloxacin and those receiving other prophylaxis regimens (P = .52 and P = .36, respectively).

follow-up period in these studies was insufficient to address 
the question of long-term resistance [6]. Other groups have 
reported increased resistance, including cross-resistance, 
after extended use of quinolones [38, 39], although this did 
not necessarily negate the benefit of prophylaxis [38]. In the 
current study, exposure to antipseudomonal β-lactam anti-
biotics, aminoglycosides, and vancomycin was reduced. This 
suggests that fluoroquinolone prophylaxis might shift antibi-
otic use away from agents less crucial for treating infection, 
thereby balancing the overall increase in exposure. Large-
scale long-term investigations are needed to assess this pros-
pect [39].
Ours is the first study to examine the effects of primary anti-
bacterial prophylaxis with levofloxacin on serious infections 
and antibiotic exposure in children undergoing induction ther-
apy for ALL. Although all prophylaxis regimens, including lev-
ofloxacin, reduced the risk of febrile neutropenia and systemic 
infection, levofloxacin prophylaxis also shifted antibiotic use 
away from agents typically used to treat infection and dramat-
ically reduced the risk of enterocolitis and C. difficile infection. 
There was no documented increase in breakthrough infections 
with resistant organisms, but this remains possible. These find-
ings support the targeted use of levofloxacin prophylaxis in chil-
dren and adolescents with ALL who are undergoing induction 
therapy, with close long-term monitoring of antibiotic resist-
ance patterns.
