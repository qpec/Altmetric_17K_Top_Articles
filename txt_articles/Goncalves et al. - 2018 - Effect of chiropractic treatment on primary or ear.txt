Effect of chiropractic treatment on primary
or early secondary prevention: a systematic
review with a pedagogic approach

, Christine Le Scanff1,2 and Charlotte Leboeuf-Yde1,2,3
Abstract
Introduction: The chiropractic vitalistic approach to the concept of ‘subluxation’ as a cause of disease lacks both
biological plausibility and possibly proof of validity. Nonetheless, some chiropractors purport to prevent disease in
general through the use of chiropractic care. Evidence of its effect is needed to be allowed to continue this practice.
The objective of this systematic review was therefore to investigate if there is any evidence that spinal manipulations/
chiropractic care can be used in primary prevention (PP) and/or early secondary prevention in diseases other than
musculoskeletal conditions.
Method: We searched PubMed, Embase, Index to Chiropractic Literature, and some specialized chiropractic journals, from
inception to October 2017, using terms including: “chiropractic”, “subluxation”, “wellness”, “prevention”, “spinal
manipulation”, “mortality”. Included were English language articles that indicated that they studied the clinical
preventive effect of or benefit from manipulative therapy/chiropractic treatment in relation to PP and/or early treatment
of physical diseases/morbidity in general, other than musculoskeletal disorders. Also, population studies were eligible.
Checklists were designed in relation to the description of the reviewed articles and some basic quality criteria.
Outcomes of studies were related to their methodological quality, disregarding results from those unable to answer
the research questions on effect of treatment.
Results: Of the 13.099 titles scrutinized, 13 articles were included (eight clinical studies and five population studies).
These studies dealt with various disorders of public health importance such as diastolic blood pressure, blood test
immunological markers, and mortality. Only two clinical studies could be used for data synthesis. None showed any
effect of spinal manipulation/chiropractic treatment.
Conclusion: We found no evidence in the literature of an effect of chiropractic treatment in the scope of PP or early
secondary prevention for disease in general. Chiropractors have to assume their role as evidence-based clinicians and
the leaders of the profession must accept that it is harmful to the profession to imply a public health importance in
relation to the prevention of such diseases through manipulative therapy/chiropractic treatment.

 Abstract
Introduction: Une partie des chiropracteurs ayant une conception vitaliste fondent leur approche sur le diagnostic et le
traitement des « subluxations ». Dans cette optique, ces dernières pourraient être à l’origine de troubles non musculo
squelettiques. Ce postulat n’est. pas plausible et semble manquer de validité. Malgré cela, certains chiropracteurs proposent
de prévenir certaines maladies à travers des soins chiropratiques. L’objectif majeur de cet article est. de recenser les preuves
concernant la prévention primaire (PP) ou la prévention secondaire précoce des maladies (autres que les troubles neuro
musculo squelettiques) en chiropraxie.
Méthode: Une recherche bibliographique a été effectuée jusqu'en octobre 2017 via PubMed, Embase, Index to
Chiropractic Literature, et d’autres journaux chiropratiques spécialisés. Les termes suivants ont été utilisés: « chiropractic »,
« subluxation », « wellness », « prevention », « spinal manipulation », « mortality ». Les articles publiés en anglais et indiquant
étudier les effets ou bénéfices des thérapies manuelles/de la chiropraxie dans le cadre de la PP/de la prévention
secondaire précoce des maladies et/ou de la morbidité en générale ont été inclus, ainsi que les études
effectuées sur des registres de populations. Des checklists ont été créées afin de décrire et de critiquer de manière
simplifiée la qualité des études. Les résultats des études ont été pris en compte en fonction de leur qualité
méthodologique. Ceux provenant des études ayant un design non adapté aux questions de recherche concernant les
effets ou bénéfices du traitement chiropratique n’ont pas été pris en compte.
Résultats: Sur les 13,099 titres recensés, 13 articles ont été retenus (huit études cliniques et cinq études sur des
registres de populations). Ces études traitent de différents sujets d’importance en santé publique: hypertension
artérielle, troubles immunologiques, mortalité, etc. Seulement deux études ont pu être utilisées pour l’analyse de leurs
résultats. Aucunes d’entre elles n’objectivent un effet suite aux manipulations vertébrales/ traitements chiropratiques.
Conclusion: Aucune preuve dans la littérature sur l’effet ou bénéfice des manipulations vertébrales/traitements
chiropratiques dans le cadre de la PP ou de la prévention secondaire précoce des maladies en général n’a pu être mis
en évidence. Les chiropracteurs doivent adopter une pratique evidence based, et les dirigeants de la profession
devraient accepter qu’il soit dangereux d’affirmer avoir un rôle dans la prévention des maladies non musculo-
squelettiques par la thérapie manuelle.

Introduction
Primary and early prevention
From a public health perspective, it is always relevant to
consider whether it is possible to prevent a disease from
occurring rather than to treat it when it is present. How-
ever, primary prevention (PP) or early secondary preven-
tion is not always successful or suitable. This can only
be applied to conditions with known and avoidable
causes. There are also other obvious ‘rules’ for applying
a preventive approach, such as it having to be both less
costly and less likely to cause adverse effects than the
treatment.
Primary prevention in chiropractic practice
Some medical conditions are well documented for being
successfully prevented through PP or early secondary pre-
vention, such as polio through vaccination [1] and dental
caries through oral hygiene and fluoride exposure [2]. Ac-
cording to a recent systematic review, chiropractors are
interested in providing PP both in relation to several gen-
eral public health issues and for musculoskeletal condi-
tions [3]. In fact, some chiropractors have adopted the
‘dental model’ in their practice, proposing to prevent
spinal problems through treatment of spinal subluxations
before symptoms arise although patients do not seem to
be particularly interested in this aspect of chiropractic care
[3]. In addition, some chiropractors even offer to help pre-
venting disease in general and advocate their services also
to people who wish to maintain good health, basing this
on a ‘vitalist’ approach which includes a belief in the ‘sub-
luxation concept’ [4, 5]. This alternative approach offers
chiropractic care (possibly in conjunction with other mo-
dalities if needed) to prevent disease in general also for
disorders outside the usual chiropractic scope of practice
and is therefore sometimes beyond the legal boundaries
for chiropractic legislation [6].
The definition of absence of disease, for this group of
chiropractors, could be the World Health Organisation
definition of health, as “a state of complete physical,
mental and social well-being and not merely the absence
of disease or infirmity” [7]. In order to obtain this
complete healthy state, according to proponents of this
approach, chiropractic treatment offers some consider-
able possibilities, because, according to Hannon in a re-
view of the chiropractic literature: “It is plausible that
chiropractic care may be of benefit to every function of
Goncalves et al. Chiropractic & Manual Therapies  (2018) 26:10 
Page 2 of 20
 the body and have the potential for long-term, overall
health benefit to those receiving chiropractic care” [8].
Challenging the subluxation model
Beliefs that a spinal subluxation can cause a multitude of
diseases and that its removal can prevent them is clearly
at odds with present-day concepts, as the aetiology of
most diseases today is considered to be multi-causal,
rarely mono-causal. It therefore seems naïve when chiro-
practors attempt to control the combined effects of
environmental, social, biological including genetic as
well as noxious lifestyle factors through the simple treat-
ment of the spine. In addition, there is presently no
obvious emphasis on the spine and the peripheral ner-
vous system as the governing organ in relation to most
pathologies of the human body.
The ‘subluxation model’ can be summarized through
several concepts, each with its obvious weakness. Ac-
cording to the first three, (i) disturbances in the spine
(frequently called ‘subluxations’) exist and (ii) these can
cause a multitude of diseases. (iii) These subluxations
can be detected in a chiropractic examination, even
before symptoms arise. However, to date, the sublux-
ation has been elusive, as there is no proof for its exist-
ence. Statements that there is a causal link between
subluxations and various diseases should therefore not
be made [9]. The fourth and fifth concepts deal with the
treatment, namely (iv) that chiropractic adjustments can
remove subluxations, (v) resulting in improved health
status. However, even if there were an improvement of a
condition following treatment, this does not mean that
the underlying theory is correct. In other words, any im-
provement may or may not be caused by the treatment,
and even if so, it does not automatically validate the
underlying theory that subluxations cause disease.
The duty to test non-plausible clinical activities
If PP of all sorts of diseases through chiropractic care
were possible, it would of course be highly relevant both
on a personal level and from a public health perspective.
However, if this is not the case, chiropractors promoting
this paradigm would be fooling their patients in an
unethical manner. Also, when health care practitioners
promote non-plausible clinical models, the burden of
evidence is surely much higher than when they deal with
plausible and generally acceptable concepts [10]. There-
fore, it is urgently necessary to review the literature for
evidence that chiropractic adjustments have an all-
embracing effect on the human body, as this is not based
on a plausible model.
Confidence in poor quality research
During our readings of the literature in this domain we
came
across
the
previously
mentioned
review
of
chiropractic research [8] that had used a non-systematic
and
non-transparent
approach
in
terms
of
search
methods, inclusion and exclusion criteria, quality assess-
ment, and synthesis of results. The author, nevertheless,
concluded that chiropractic adjustments “confer measur-
able health benefits to people regardless of the presence
or absence of symptoms” and “the notion that there is
no evidence of chiropractic care being of benefit to indi-
viduals without musculoskeletal complaints appears er-
roneous”. With such a publication in hand, many
research-naïve chiropractors would consider themselves
‘evidence-based’
, when giving chiropractic adjustments
with the intent to prevent disease from occurring.
Pedagogic dimension
Presumably authors of methodologically weak reports
are unlikely to perform low quality studies on purpose.
It is our belief that such studies are the result of an in-
complete understanding of the basic criteria for ‘good’
research and lack of assistance from the accepted
research community. There is also the problem of the
lack of any ‘good’ research in existence. So it becomes
also a dual issue of reviewers not understanding good re-
search and the lack of good research for them to ‘under-
stand’. Therefore, it would be important not only to
uncover the evidence level for the use of chiropractic
care in PP and early secondary prevention in a literature
review but also to add a pedagogic dimension to the re-
port, in case some of the articles reviewed would be
methodologically unacceptable. This expectation is not
unreasonable, as – in our experience – this type of arti-
cles often seems to end up in the grey literature and in
journals of lesser standard.
Objectives
The research questions of our review were:
– For which physical, non-musculoskeletal diseases
has the effect/benefit of chiropractic treatment been
studied in the chiropractic literature?
And within those studies:
– Which study designs have been used?
– Were the designs appropriate to uncover effect of
intervention?
– Was the basic methodological quality sufficient to
make results credible?
– What evidence is there that chiropractic treatment
can prevent disease or stop it in its early stage?
Method
The review was registered in PROSPERO, with the reference
CRD42017074245.

 Identifying relevant studies
We performed a number of systematic searches, scrutin-
izing both the ‘normal’ indexed scientific literature and
the more ‘grey’ literature to which we had access. A li-
brarian was consulted for the search of articles in
journals that could be traced through PubMed and
Embase. MeSH terms (PubMed) and Emtree terms
(Embase)
were
not
used
because
they
would
not
necessarily exist or be helpful for this topic. Instead, we
did a free text search using terms in relation to chiro-
practic
and
prevention/wellness,
accepting
that
we
would have to screen a large number of irrelevant texts
in order to capture the few studies on this topic that
might exist. Additional searches were performed using the
Index of Chiropractic Literature, Journal of Chiropractic
Medicine, Journal of Vertebral Subluxation Research, and
the journal Functional Neurology, Rehabilitation, and
Ergonomics. The equations and search terms are available
in Table 1 (col. 1 and 2). In addition, we scrutinized the
reference list of the previously mentioned review by
Hannon [8] for studies on effect or benefit of treatment. A
hand search was also done consulting texts and reference
lists of relevant articles. We accepted only articles written
in English and there was no limitation for year of
publication.
Article selection
Two authors (GG and CLY) independently selected the
peer-reviewed articles from the titles on PubMed, Embase,
Index of Chiropractic Literature, and the articles obtained
through our other sources. They also screened all the is-
sues of the: Journal of Vertebral Subluxation Research and
the Journal of Chiropractic Medicine. In addition, GG
screened the Functional Neurology, Rehabilitation and
Ergonomics journal twice and blindly, and the reference
lists of relevant articles were searched by the same author.
Potentially interesting articles were scrutinized independ-
ently by GG and CLY for inclusion and exclusion criteria
using abstracts and, if in doubt, full texts.
Inclusion criteria
We included published research articles that suggested
or specifically stated that they studied the clinical pre-
ventive effect of or benefit from manipulative therapy/
chiropractic
treatment
(with
or
without
adjunctive
measures) in relation to PP and/or early treatment of
physical diseases/morbidity in general, other than mus-
culoskeletal
disorders.
Also,
studies
including
early
markers of ill health were included. Included were also
studies
of
prevention
of
early
death.
Clinical
and
epidemiological studies were eligible. Chiropractic treat-
ment was defined as any treatment provided by a chiro-
practor. Outcome had to be studied in a clinical context,
meaning that purely experimental studies with baseline
and immediate post-treatment measurements were not
of interest.
We referred to some case studies but did not include
them in our formal analysis because we did not classify

 them as ‘research articles’. The reason for their inclusion
was that they gave the impression to the reader that they
studied some type of prevention and we wanted to deal
with this from a pedagogic angle. However, they were not
included in our PRISMA chart, as they had not been ob-
tained in an exhaustive search procedure; they were rather
papers that happened to be found whilst we searched for
our ‘proper’ studies and were allowed to remain. Reviews,
discussion papers, abstract proceedings, comments, letters
to the editor, and animal studies were not included.
Exclusion criteria
In addition to the case study exclusion we excluded
studies on risk of falling, improved sport performance,
infertility and pregnancy. We excluded also studies on
‘wellness’ and general well-being as measured exclusively
through questionnaires and we did not take these as-
pects into account if they were included as a part of an
otherwise relevant study.
Charting the data
Checklists
Five checklists were designed in relation to the description
of the reviewed articles and some basic quality criteria.
A preliminary read of some of these articles indicated
that it would not be possible to perform a formal
Cochrane type review for effect of treatment, due to the
generally poor methodological quality. The quality con-
trol of articles was therefore simple, concentrating
mainly on the study design to establish if it were at all
possible to answer questions on effect of treatment in a
scientifically acceptable manner. The quality checklist
for the clinical studies was basic, consisting only of the
major methodological points expected to be present in
randomized controlled clinical trials, as this is the study
design one would expect when searching for effect of
treatment/intervention. Another simple checklist was
used for population studies.
Our checklists have been described in Tables 2, 3, 4, 5
and 6.
1. Descriptive checklist for clinical studies (Table 2):
� First author, year of publication, name of journal,
affiliation, country;
� Research question(s)/purpose of the study;
� Type of manipulative therapy/chiropractic
treatment;
� Outcome variables for studied condition;
� Authors’/author’s conclusion in relation to effect/
benefit of chiropractic treatment.
Quality checklist for clinical studies (Table 3):
� Methodological considerations
� Design
� Comparison with non-treated (placebo) or an other-
wise treated group;
� Random and concealed allocation to treatment
groups;
� Main outcome variable(s) validated in some way;
� Assessor blinded to treatment group.
� Were differences between groups tested for
statistical significance in relation to effect/benefit of
treatment?
� Comments by reviewers in relation to major
methodological improvements needed to test effect/
benefit of intervention.
2. Descriptive checklist for population studies (Table 4):
� First author, year of publication, name of journal,
affiliation, country;
� Research question(s)/purpose of the study;
� Design;
� Study population;
� Outcome variables;
� Which factors associated with cause were included?
� Authors’/author’s conclusion in relation to effect/
benefit of chiropractic treatment.
Quality checklist for population studies (Table 5):
� Selection of study subjects (whole population,
random selection, convenience sample);
� Response/Non response comparison;
� Definition of chiropractic treatment;
� Outcome variables validated in some way;
� Control for other variables that could have an effect
on outcome;
� Comments by reviewers in relation to major
methodological improvements needed to test effect/
benefit of intervention.
Finally, a descriptive checklist (Table 6) was designed for
case studies on this subject in order to have an overview
of the diseases studied in the chiropractic literature.
The items were:
– First author, year of publication, name of journal,
affiliation, country;
– Disorder studied;
– Type of treatment;
– Authors’/Author’s conclusion in relation to effect/
benefit of chiropractic treatment.

randomized controlled clinical trial
design or (possibly) b) be tested for
outcome in a sufficiently large non-
controlled prospective outcome study
that allows for subgroup analyses. The
diagnosis of predominantly sympathetic
and parasympathetic subjects must be
valid and/or reproducible. The assessment
should be done with valid/reproducible
methods by assessors that are blinded to
classification group.

To test if chiropractic care and dose of

this could have been done for different

tested in a similar way, i.e. a group of
patients receiving short-term and one
long-term treatment in a random fashion.
The results in this study relate only to

To examine if chiropractors as opposed to
medical practitioners have a real effect on
health outcomes on a public health level,
a more sophisticated type of analysis would
be needed, taking into account a large
number of variables that are linked to both
the relative presence of chiropractors and
the development of disease. This would
have to be tested in multivariate models
as it is not enough to investigate such
variables one by one holding them up
against the outcome variables (e.g. disease
or mortality rates).

 case of continued disagreement. Data interpretation was
done through discussions. Each article was discussed in
view of its checklist findings and any methodological
weaknesses. Agreement had also to be reached on which
major remedial action would have been relevant for the
various types of studies, if their quality was considered

Results
Descriptive information
Of the 13.099 titles scrutinized, we retained 13 full text
articles for the final review (Fig. 1). Of these, five articles
came from our PubMed/Embase searches, whilst eight
were found in the Journal of Vertebral Subluxation
Research. As described in Tables 2 and 3, eight were pro-
spective clinical studies [11–18] published between 1997
and 2016. Seven originated in America and six were
published
in
the
Journal
of
Vertebral
Subluxation
Research. Five register studies [19–23] were included
(Tables 4 and 5), published between 2007 and 2013 by
the same author. Three out of these five articles were
published in the Journal of Vertebral Subluxation Re-
search. Finally, we included five case reports [24–28]
that were found in the reference list of Hannon’s review
(Table 6). These all originated in America and were also
published in the Journal/Annals of Vertebral Sublux-
ation
Research.

 included the word ‘effect’. The provenance of all the se-
lected articles and the case studies is illustrated in Table 8.
Reasons for inclusion in the review
Words used to indicate that the investigator or reader
would have in mind effect or benefit of treatment when
reading these articles were: “influence”, “relationship”,
“increase...after care”, “assess effect”, “possible links to ...
improved aspects of”, “change”, “produces additional
benefits”, and “treatment effect”.
For which physical, non-musculoskeletal diseases has the
effect/benefit of chiropractic treatment been studied in
the chiropractic literature?
Disorders studied in the clinical studies were: lung func-
tion (n = 2), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (n = 2),
visual acuity, and three proxies for/markers of good
health: salivary pH, plasma serum thiol, and blood test
immunological markers (Tables 2 and 3).
The five population studies (Tables 4 and 5) dealt with
various disorders of public health importance, such as
obesity, infectious disease, but also mortality.
The five case reports dealt with diabetes mellitus,
cholesterol levels, multiple conditions with dyslipidae-
mia, cardiovascular disease risk factors. Heart rate vari-
ability was studied as a proxy for/marker of a healthy
state (Table 6).
Which study designs have been used and were they
relevant to uncover effect or benefit of intervention?
Although most clinical studies were prospective in design
(Tables 2 and 3) they were mainly simple descriptive

 outcome studies without control group. Three in-
cluded a control group but only two used a prospect-
ive two-arm randomized controlled study design; one
including two identically treated groups with spinal
manipulation added to one of these (studying added
benefit of treatment) [17], and one consisting of a
treated and a placebo group (studying effect of treat-
ment) [18]. The third study with a control group used
a retrospective case-control study design in relation
to the influence of chiropractic treatment on DNA re-
pair [14]. Probably, only clinical studies using a pro-
spective two-arm approach would be able to compare
outcomes between different treatments.
Also, properly conducted population studies could be able
to cast some light on the benefit of chiropractic care from a
public health perspective. The five included population
studies obtained their data from N. American national
registers, which might be interesting depending on the
origin, completeness, contents, and quality of data of these
registers.
The case reports (Table 6) consisted of particular pa-
tients encountered in clinical practice probably with
retrospective data collection. Case reports are usually
not suitable to answer research questions relating to
treatment effect.
Therefore, theoretically, seven or possibly eight of the
articles would be able to provide answers relating to
effect and/or benefit of manipulative therapy/chiroprac-
tic care in the area of prevention and early treatment of
disease,
namely
two
or
three
clinical
studies
that
included a control group [14, 17, 18] and five population
studies [19–23]. Nevertheless, a further look at the study
approach of the retrospective clinical study and the
population studies revealed considerable weaknesses.
Was the basic methodological quality sufficient to make
results credible?
Clinical studies
Three of the clinical studies included a control group,
whether placebo or other treatment. However, the study
that was retrospective in design was unlikely to have in-
cluded objectively studied and similar patients, which
makes comparisons of treatment outcomes non-credible.
Therefore, only the prospective studies had the potential
of providing correct answers to their research questions
on effect and benefit. Both these studies included also
important aspects such as blinding of patients (in the
effect-study) and blinding of assessors (in both studies)
and described carefully their study methods and results
in a transparent manner, allowing for reproduction of
their studies. The retrospective study was not set up as
an experiment and therefore did not use blinded asses-
sors. In addition, methodological information was miss-
ing and confusing in the report.
Population studies
None of the register studies described clearly the origin
and quality of these registers (Tables 4 and 5) and, in the
analysis, did not take into account the complex correla-
tions between potential and known moderating and con-
founding factors in real life that have an effect on
morbidity and mortality and were therefore not able to
account for the potential independent influence that
medical and/or chiropractic practitioner density could
have on health outcomes.
Case reports
As previously mentioned, case-reports are not suit-
able
to
describe
effect
or
benefit
of
treatment.
Despite this, one of the authors [26] wants to pro-
mote the idea that subluxation-based chiropractic
care may help prevent heart disease and various
other conditions.
What evidence of effect is there?
In sum, we found no evidence of effect of manipulative
therapy/chiropractic treatment based on these included
articles. Only one article can be used to draw conclu-
sions on ‘effect’. The prospective two-armed randomized
controlled clinical trial compared a real treatment on a
‘treated group’ (i.e. toggle recoil) with a sham treatment
in a ‘placebo group’
, on subjects diagnosed with prehy-
pertension or stage 1 hypertension. According to this
article, there was an absence of effect of spinal manipu-
lation therapy.
The other methodologically acceptable article reported
on a prospective two-armed randomized controlled
clinical that was suitable to determine if manipulative
therapy had an ‘added benefit’ in patients with primary
dysfunctional
breathing, who all
received
breathing
retraining. No such benefit was noted.
None of the other articles were considered suitable to
establish effect or benefit of chiropractic treatment.
Discussion
Summary
Of the approximatively 13.000 articles initially identified
as potentially suitable for our review only 13 were in-
cluded. Although their authors usually avoided to state
explicitly that they were studying effect of treatment,
they would imply somehow in their text that this was
the case, which earned them a place in our review. A
wide variety of diseases were examined but, according to
the only two studies with a suitable research design to
answer our research questions, there was no effect or
benefit of chiropractic care in the prevention/early treat-
ment of high blood pressure and no extra benefit was
found for manipulative therapy on dysfunctional breath-
ing. In sum, we could not find any evidence in favour of
Goncalves et al. Chiropractic & Manual Therapies  (2018) 26:10 
Page 15 of 20
 the argument that manipulative therapy/chiropractic
care can prevent or stop early disease.
General methodological considerations
Although at first look there appears to be a literature on
this subject, it is apparent that most authors lack know-
ledge in research methodology. The two methodologic-
ally acceptable studies in our review were found in
PubMed, whereas most of the others were identified in
the non-indexed literature. We therefore conclude that
it may not be worthwhile in the future to search exten-
sively the non-indexed chiropractic literature for high
quality research articles.
One misunderstanding requires some explanations;
case reports are usually not considered suitable evidence
for effect of treatment, even if the cases relate to patients
who ‘recovered’ with treatment. The reasons for this are
multiple, such as:
� Individual cases, usually picked out on the basis of
their uniqueness, do not reflect general patterns.
� Individual successful cases, even if correctly
interpreted must be validated in a ‘proper’ research
design, which usually means that presumed effect
must be tested in a properly powered and designed
randomized controlled trial.
� One or two successful cases may reflect a true but
very unusual recovery, and such cases are more
likely to be written up and published as clinicians do
not take the time to marvel over and spend time on
writing and publishing all the other unsuccessful
treatment attempts.
� Recovery may be co-incidental, caused by some
other aspect in the patient’s life or it may simply re-
flect the natural course of the disease, such as nat-
ural remission or the regression towards the mean,
which in human physiology means that low values
tend to increase and high values decrease over time.
� Cases are usually captured at the end because the results
indicate success, meaning that the clinical file has to be
reconstructed, because tests were used for clinical
reasons and not for research reasons (i.e. recorded by
the treating clinician during an ordinary clinical session)
and therefore usually not objective and reproducible.
� The presumed results of the treatment of the disease
is communicated from the patient to the treating
clinician and not to a third, neutral person and
obviously this link is not blinded, so the clinician is
both biased in favour of his own treatment and
aware of which treatment was given, and so is the
patient, which may result in overly positive
reporting. The patient wants to please the
sympathetic clinician and the clinician is proud of
his own work and overestimates the results.
� The long-term effects are usually not known.
� Further, and most importantly, there is no control
group, so it is impossible to compare the results to
an untreated or otherwise treated person or group
of persons.
Nevertheless, it is common to see case reports in some
research journals and in communities with readers/prac-
titioners without a firmly established research culture it
is often considered a good thing to ‘start’ by publishing
case reports.
Case reports are useful for other reasons, such as indi-
cating the need for further clinical studies in a specific
patient population, describing a clinical presentation or
treatment approach, explaining particular procedures,
discussing cases, and referring to the evidence behind a
clinical process, but they should not be used to make
people believe that there is an effect of treatment. In
fact, there are ‘rules’ for how to deal with case reports,
such as the CARE guidelines by Gagnier et al. [29].
All clinical studies but two suffered from serious
methodological problems.
� The main problem was that five out of the eight
prospective outcome studies did not have a control
group. Clearly, in order to find out if a treatment
has an effect, a comparison to no treatment must be
made or a comparison to another treatment that is
known to have an effect. Further, this ‘no treatment’
group must be masked into a sham treatment, to
allow for the placebo effect that probably always
plays a role in clinical practice.
� Interestingly, only two of the five prospective studies
without a control group mentioned this as a
problem. Nevertheless, instead of discussing this
lack of control group, the authors of three articles
mentioned that there would be a need for larger
studies. However, larger studies will not remedy this
fundamental flaw in the study design.
� When comparing outcomes between different types
of treatment approach, the sham group is not relevant
but the study subjects should not have a preference
for one type of treatment or the other. Therefore, it is
difficult to perform such studies on chiropractors,
chiropractic patients and chiropractic students, as
study participants should be ‘naïve’. To account for
expectation bias, study subjects’ preferences should be
elicited prior to the start of the study and taken into
account during the analysis.
� When establishing effect or benefit of treatment, it
is also necessary that the study subjects are captured
at about the same period of time, as the disease, the
treatment and study subjects may change over time.
It is usually not a good idea to simply compare one
Goncalves et al. Chiropractic & Manual Therapies  (2018) 26:10 
Page 16 of 20
 type of treatment with the results of another type of
treatment carried out x number of years ago or at
the same time in some other clinic. The reasons why
the study subjects should be captured in the same
place is that they should be fairly representative of
that patient group, and different countries, areas of a
country, clinics and clinicians may attract
fundamentally different types of patients with
inherently different prognoses.
� The allocation into one study group or another
should be done in a random fashion, in such a way
that nobody can guide different patient types into a
specific group because they seem more suitable in
that group. Random allocation usually avoids
clustering of certain patient types in one group,
which may have an effect on treatment outcome if
these groups react differently to treatment.
� Other important aspects are that the person who
assesses the outcome should not be the person who
treats the patient and should also be blind to which
study group the person assessed belongs to. The
outcome variables should be objective and relevant
in relation to measuring whether the disease
improved or not. Further, tests should be reliable
when carried out by different examiners and also
consistent (reproducible) within the study subject if
the test is carried out over several times, to ensure
that any changes occurring over time are due to the
treatment and not to the instability of the test or
inability of the tester.
Theoretically, it would be possible in population-based
studies to compare patterns of disease and mortality in rela-
tion to various factors, such as the density of various health
practitioners in the population. This could be done in epi-
demiologic studies of randomly selected people from the
general population, ecological studies in which people live
through a so-called ‘natural experiments’
, and data bases
from the health insurance industry or those holding socio-
economic, morbidity and mortality data.
However, to observe the ‘effect’ of chiropractic care,
through a comparison of an area with access to chiroprac-
tic care versus an area with less or no such access, as was
the attempt in the five reviewed population studies, it
would be necessary to take into account factors that might
incite chiropractors to settle in a specific area. In poorer
areas there would be fewer chiropractors because of the
difficulty to run a successful practice but poor people are
also sicker and die younger than more financially comfort-
able people [30, 31]. Therefore, increased morbidity or
mortality that seems to be linked with the number of chi-
ropractors would instead depend on other more funda-
mental factors. None of the five register studies included
in this review took into account, properly, the moderating
or confounding influence that such variables could have
on their initial results. They simply reported the links be-
tween chiropractor density and various other predictive
factors vs. disease or mortality in independently reported
analyses, such as comparing the number of deaths in rela-
tion to a) the mean age of the study sample, b) the type of
social class in the area, c) the proportion of chiropractors
vs. general practitioners but did not combine these using
appropriate statistical methods.
In comparison, we reviewed a population-based study
on the elderly population in N. America [32] but could
not include it because the outcome was established
through questionnaires, not through objective measure-
ments. This study collected a large number of variables
at baseline on community dwelling persons who went
through a clinical trial. They then compared health out-
comes for those who consulted chiropractors and those
who did not, and found that there seemed to be a better
health profile for the chiropractic subgroup. However,
when they statistically controlled on a number of base-
line variables which indicated that the two groups were
somewhat
different
(in
relation
to
age,
strenuous
physical activity, health status, and arthritis status), the
difference between the chiropractic group and the other
disappeared. The explanation for this is that these add-
itional factors were associated to both the choice of
practitioner and the health outcome. However, they were
the reasons for health and disease, not the health practi-
tioner. Therefore, the link between the use of chiroprac-
tors and better health was only an apparent one. This
example is given to illustrate the importance of includ-
ing relevant ‘competing’ factors when looking at cause-
effect in population studies.
Methodological consideration of the review process
The screening of so many titles may result in errors due
to fatigue but it was done blindly by two of the authors
to avoid mistakes and it was never necessary to consult
the third author. In relation to the journal Functional
Neurology, Rehabilitation and Ergonomics, in which all
published articles were screened, this was done by only
one of the authors but it was done blindly at two separ-
ate occasions. Although some studies could not be
found, it is unlikely that they would have brought any
positive evidence for chiropractic care and PP or early
secondary prevention, as they were published in the
‘non-indexed’ literature in PubMed.
We designed our own checklists to meet the specific
needs of this review. It was not considered appropriate
to employ the Cochrane checklist, for example, as pre-
liminary readings of some of this literature indicated that
the quality problems would become apparent with a
much less sophisticated scrutiny. Another research team
would probably have designed a somewhat different list
Goncalves et al. Chiropractic & Manual Therapies  (2018) 26:10 
Page 17 of 20
 of items. However, this would undoubtedly have identi-
fied the glaring methodological problems apparent in
most of this literature. Our checklists were easily
completed, and the third reviewer was, again, not re-
quired to act as a referee, indicating the checklists were
user-friendly. The results were interpreted in a narrative
way, no meta-analysis has been done, because this was
not appropriate.
We reviewed only 13 relevant articles but there is, in
fact, a literature on the experimental effects of spinal
manipulation in relation to various physiological out-
come variables. These were not included, as we were in-
terested in the clinical picture only. Also, the review
approach to such articles would have to be different and
should therefore be done in separate reviews.
Future considerations
The need for evidence
For
groups
of chiropractors, prevention of disease
through chiropractic treatment makes perfect sense, yet
the credible literature is void of evidence thereof. Still,
the majority of chiropractors practising this way prob-
ably believe that there is plenty of evidence in the litera-
ture. Clearly, if the chiropractic profession wishes to
maintain credibility, it is time seriously to face this issue.
Presently, there seems to be no reason why political
associations and educational institutions should recom-
mend spinal care to prevent disease in general, unless
relevant
and
acceptable
research
evidence
can
be
produced to support such activities. In order to be
allowed to continue this practice, proper and relevant re-
search is therefore needed. However, such activities need
to be guided by some fundamental concepts, as dis-
cussed below.
First, the concept of biological plausibility
In order to proceed to a research study, there must be a
credible anatomical, physiological, and/or biological ra-
tionale for the link between the treatment and the PP or
early secondary prevention of the disease under scrutiny.
Second, the concept of quality of research
In order to show effect of intervention, properly con-
ducted randomized controlled trials should be carried
out, as described above. This usually requires the partici-
pation of independent and professional researchers and
they are costly and therefore require funding. Further, it
is unethical to conduct poor quality studies because:
they inconvenience subjects on studies with no conse-
quences, they are a waste of money that could have been
used on quality projects, and they can be misleading for
both chiropractors and their patients. High quality, hon-
est studies evoke admiration and acceptance in scientific
and health care environments and will have a good effect
on the chiropractic profession, for everybody to enjoy,
regardless if the results are ‘positive’ or ‘negative’.
The concept of the three pillars of evidence based practice
The three pillars of evidence-based medicine are often
described as (i) the scientific evidence, (ii) the practi-
tioner’s experience, (iii) and the patient’s preference.
However, the practitioner’s experience is not objective
(please see the description of the problems with case
reports above), in particular in relation to ‘effect’ of
treatment.
It is therefore not enough to say that ‘it works’. The
clinical experience is important in many other ways but
not for judging effect of treatment. Therefore, as it has
been stated before [33], “it is important to keep a hum-
ble attitude to one’s own clinical experience and not to
think that it overrides the evidence obtained in a good
quality RCT”.
The need for educating chiropractors on how to read and
evaluate research
All chiropractors who want to update their knowledge
or to have an evidence-based practice will search new
information on the internet. If they are not trained to
read the scientific literature, they might trust any article.
In this situation, it is logical that the ‘believers’ will
choose ‘attractive’ articles and trust the results, without
checking the quality of the studies. It is therefore im-
portant to educate chiropractors to become relatively
competent consumers of research, so they will not as-
sume that every published article is a verity in itself.
Prevention in chiropractic practice
The desire to improve health in general for patients [3]
indicates a common idealistic streak in large groups of
the chiropractic profession. In relation to illness in
general, all clinicians have a duty to inform and assist
patients to avoid preventable disorders, and chiroprac-
tors can provide inspiration in this area and also
monitor lifestyle changes, as back pain is a recurring dis-
order that often results in long term clinical relationships.
However, prevention of disease through spinal adjustment
is, until further notice, futile.
Conclusion
We could find no evidence in the literature for chiroprac-
tic care as a credible approach to primary prevention or
early secondary prevention in general health.
Chiropractors should therefore assume their responsi-
bilities as an evidence-based, mature health care profes-
sion and seize such activities until, if ever, new evidence
emerges.
Prevention can still be an important part of the chiro-
practic scope, if it is aimed at well researched and
Goncalves et al. Chiropractic & Manual Therapies  (2018) 26:10 
Page 18 of 20
 acceptable approaches such as the management of life-
style factors to prevent co-morbidities so often found to-
gether with spinal problems.
Back problems are highly prevalent in the population
and as they are usually recurring disorders there is a
need for a knowledgeable and realistic profession to care
for people during acute episodes and to guide them
through the various periods of back pain.
It is unclear why some chiropractors feel the need to ex-
tend their scope of practice into implausible areas, when
there is so much to do in the musculoskeletal field.
