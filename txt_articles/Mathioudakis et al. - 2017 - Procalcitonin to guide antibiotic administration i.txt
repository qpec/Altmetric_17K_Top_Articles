ABSTRACT
Challenges in the differentiation of the aetiology of acute exacerbations of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) have led to significant overuse of antibiotics. Serum
procalcitonin, released in response to bacterial infections, but not viral infections, could possibly identify
AECOPD requiring antibiotics. In this meta-analysis we assessed the clinical effectiveness of procalcitonin-
based protocols to initiate or discontinue antibiotics in patients presenting with AECOPD.
Based on a prospectively registered protocol, we reviewed the literature and selected randomised or
quasi-randomised trials comparing procalcitonin-based protocols to initiate or discontinue antibiotics
versus standard care in AECOPD. We followed Cochrane and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations,
Assessment, Development and Evaluation) guidance to assess risk of bias, quality of evidence and to
perform meta-analyses.
We included eight trials evaluating 1062 patients with AECOPD. Procalcitonin-based protocols
decreased antibiotic prescription (relative risk (RR) 0.56, 95% CI 0.43–0.73) and total antibiotic exposure
(mean difference (MD) −3.83, 95% CI (−4.32–−3.35)), without affecting clinical outcomes such as rate of
treatment failure (RR 0.81, 0.62–1.06), length of hospitalisation (MD −0.76, −1.95–0.43), exacerbation
recurrence rate (RR 0.96, 0.69–1.35) or mortality (RR 0.99, 0.58–1.69). However, the quality of the available
evidence is low to moderate, because of methodological limitations and small overall study population.
Procalcitonin-based protocols appear to be clinically effective; however, confirmatory trials with rigorous
methodology are required.

REVIEW
COPD
 Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a prevalent chronic debilitating disease, is expected to be
the fourth leading cause of death by 2030, according to World Health Organization projections [1]. Acute
exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) determine disease morbidity, mortality, healthcare utilisation and
associated costs [2]. Prior studies have described different types of exacerbations, such as those driven by
bacteria, viruses or by enhanced eosinophilic inflammation [3]. These findings provided a better
understanding of the mechanisms of AECOPD and should have led to a more personalised approach in
their pharmacological management, which traditionally comprises the combination of bronchodilators and
oral corticosteroids with or without the administration of antibiotics [4]. However, the lack of simple tests
to aid the distinction between different types of exacerbations in the acute phase has been a significant
hindrance. As a result, both oral steroids and antibiotics are administered lavishly in a large proportion of
exacerbations, regardless of their cause [5], posing significant and possibly avoidable risks to individual
patients and, in the case of antibiotics, to society as well [6].
Procalcitonin, the prohormone of calcitonin, is released in different tissues in response to bacterial, but not
viral, infections or nonspecific inflammation [7]. For this reason, procalcitonin is a promising biomarker,
which is currently used in the diagnosis of bacterial infections in different settings [8–11]. Such a
biomarker could be very useful in the differentiation between COPD exacerbations caused by bacteria and
exacerbations with other aetiologies. Nevertheless, its use in COPD could be more challenging, due to the
chronically elevated baseline inflammatory status and the chronic bacterial colonisation of the airways [12],
and therefore needs to be assessed carefully. Some randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been
conducted to evaluate procalcitonin-based versus standard protocols to guide the decision to initiate or
discontinue the administration of antibiotics in patients presenting with AECOPD [13, 14]. The aim of
this study was to identify all available RCTs and yield overall effect estimates of different measures of
clinical effectiveness of procalcitonin-based protocols to guide the administration of antibiotics in patients
with AECOPD.
Methods
This systematic review and meta-analysis is based on a protocol which was prospectively registered in the
PROSPERO register for systematic reviews (www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.asp?ID=CRD4
2016036938) [15]. The present report follows the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement [16].
Eligibility criteria
Eligible studies comprised randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing procalcitonin-
based versus standard protocols to guide the initiation or discontinuation of antibiotics in patients
presenting with AECOPD. In addition, we evaluated trials focusing on patients with lower respiratory tract
infections or respiratory tract infections in general, and we included subgroups of patients recruited with
AECOPD, provided that they included ⩾30 patients and we were able to acquire adequate data regarding
the baseline characteristics and outcomes of these subgroups. We only accepted procalcitonin-based
protocols if they included a recommendation to initiate or continue antibiotics for serum procalcitonin
levels above a prespecified cut-point and to discontinue or not to initiate for lower levels. Any other
protocol used in clinical practice was acceptable as a comparator, provided that the clinicians were
unaware of the participants’ procalcitonin levels. A previous clinical diagnosis of COPD was considered
adequate; AECOPD was defined as a deterioration of the patients’ respiratory symptoms that is beyond the
normal day-to-day variations and leads to a change in medication. Only studies of patients seeking
medical advice in a primary care facility or hospital emergency, respiratory or internal medicine
department were accepted. Studies focusing on hospital-acquired infections or studies performed in the
intensive care unit (ICU) were excluded. In addition, patients with immunodeficiencies or receiving
immune-suppressants (apart from corticosteroids administered for the management of COPD), patients
with chronic infections requiring chronic antibiotic therapy and patients with medullary thyroid
carcinoma were excluded.
Outcome measures
The primary outcomes of this meta-analysis included 1) treatment failure for the index exacerbation,
defined as deterioration of symptoms, non-improvement or death (within 1–4 weeks) and 2) length of
hospitalisation for the index exacerbation. The secondary outcomes included 1) antibiotic exposure for the
index exacerbation (including the proportion of patients who were prescribed antibiotics and the duration
of the course of antibiotics) and at longest follow-up; 2) antibiotic prescription after an opposite initial
decision; 3) re-exacerbation rate at longest follow-up; 4) re-admission rate at longest follow-up; and
5) mortality at longest follow-up.

 The aim of this meta-analysis was to examine whether procalcitonin-guided protocols are associated with a
significant decrease in the antibiotic exposure (secondary outcome 1), without significantly affecting any of
the clinically important outcomes of an exacerbation (remaining outcomes).
Search strategy and study selection
We systematically reviewed the electronic databases of Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register
of Controlled Trials, using appropriate controlled vocabulary and free search terms to identify studies
assessing procalcitonin in patients with COPD (detailed search strategy is described in online
supplementary appendix 1). In addition, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials
Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal, as well as the online registries of abstract proceedings of the
European Respiratory Society and the American Thoracic Society and the reference lists of all included
trials and all previous relevant systematic reviews that we identified were screened for additional ongoing or
completed trials. All databases and online registries were searched from inception to July 19, 2016. Two
authors independently screened the titles, abstracts and full text (when appropriate) of all identified articles.
Disagreement was resolved through discussion or adjudication by a third investigator when necessary.
Data abstraction
Two authors independently extracted the following information from each eligible article: full reference
and study identifiers, study design, eligibility criteria, predefined outcomes, number and characteristics of
the participants and details on the outcomes of interest. Missing data were requested from the authors of
the primary studies via e-mail.
Risk of bias and quality of evidence
Risk of bias of each included study was assessed by two authors independently and discrepancies were resolved
through discussion, according to Cochrane guidance. A domain-based evaluation was used, which included
the following domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel,
blinding of outcome assessment, attrition, selective reporting bias and other sources of bias. Explicit judgments
were made about the overall risk of bias according to the Cochrane guidance [17]. Risk of bias was assessed
separately for different outcomes of interest when that was considered appropriate by the investigators. We
were not able to assess the risk of publication bias, due to the small number of included trials (<10).
Quality of evidence for each outcome was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations
Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology, which incorporates risk of bias as well as
imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness and publication bias of the body of evidence, using the outcomes
as units of analysis [18]. All decisions to downgrade or upgrade the quality of evidence were justified and
presented in evidence profile and summary of evidence tables, in accordance with the GRADE guidance.
GRADEPro Software (2014; www.gradepro.org) was used in the development of these tables.
According to GRADE working group evaluation, “high quality” evidence suggests that further research is very
unlikely to change the confidence in the estimate of effect; “moderate quality” that further research is likely to
have an important impact on the confidence in the estimate effect and may change the estimate; “low quality”
evidence suggests that further research is very likely to have an important impact on the confidence in the
estimate effect and it is likely to change the estimate; and “very low quality” evidence that we are very
uncertain of the estimate.
Heterogeneity
I2 statistic was used to assess statistical heterogeneity within the trials included in each analysis. Substantial
heterogeneity (I2 >50%) was explored by prespecified subgroup analyses (see later).
Data synthesis
Data were pooled using the fixed or random effect models in cases where heterogeneity, assessed using the
I2 statistic, was found to be <50% or 50–75%, respectively. Meta-analyses were not performed in cases of
significant unresolved heterogeneity (I2 >75%). Results are presented in the form of relative risk (RR) (95%
CI) for dichotomous data and in the form of mean differences (MD) (95% CI) for continuous data.
Meta-analyses were performed using Review Manager 5 (RevMan; http://community.cochrane.org/tools/
review-production-tools/revman-5) software.
Sensitivity and subgroup analyses
In different prespecified sensitivity and subgroup analyses for all outcomes we included 1) only studies with
low risk of bias; 2) only studies with high adherence to the procalcitonin-guided protocols; 3) only studies
using procalcitonin to guide the initiation of antibiotics; and 4) only studies using procalcitonin to guide the
discontinuation of antibiotics. Furthermore, for outcomes measured at longest follow-up, we grouped studies

 with duration of ⩽3 months versus >3 months. Finally, in an additional sensitivity analysis, we repeated the
meta-analyses performed using the fixed effects model using the random effects model and vice versa.
Results
Details of the search results and study selection process are provided in a PRISMA flowchart (online
supplementary appendix 2).
Characteristics of the included trials
Characteristics of the included trials are presented in online supplementary appendix 3. Briefly, eight
completed trials evaluating 1062 patients with AECOPD met the inclusion criteria. All were conducted in a
hospital setting and recruited patients who had an emergency visit or admission. Five recruited only patients
attending with an AECOPD [13, 14, 19–21], while the rest recruited patients with lower respiratory tract
infections in general, but included well-characterised and presented subsets of patients who were recruited with
an AECOPD [22–24]. Four trials had a follow-up duration of 6 months [13, 14, 20, 22], one only followed the
patients during the period of their hospital admission [23] and the rest between 4 and 6 weeks. No significant
differences in the baseline characteristics of the patients included in each study arm were reported.
The procalcitonin-based protocols used in all included trials were similar. Antibiotics were recommended
for procalcitonin levels >0.25 μg·L−1 and discouraged for levels <0.25 μg·L−1 in seven out of eight studies
(NANGIA and GANDHI [21] used a different cut-point, as they recommended antibiotics for procalcitonin
levels >0.5 μg·L−1). In addition, in some of the studies antibiotics were strongly discouraged for levels
<0.1 μg·L−1 and/or strongly recommended for levels >0.5 μg·L−1. All studies were open labelled or single
blinded and the final decision to administer or withhold antibiotics was left to the responsible clinician,
who could deviate from the protocol. In three of the included trials procalcitonin levels were used to guide
the initiation of antibiotic treatment [13, 21, 22]; in two of the trials, procalcitonin levels guided early
discontinuation of antibiotics [14, 23]; and in three trials, procalcitonin levels guided both initiation and
discontinuation [19, 20, 24]. Adherence to the procalcitonin-based protocols was reported in four trials
and it varied significantly, between 61.3% and 98.1% [19, 20, 23, 24].
The strategies used in the control group were similar in all trials but one. VERDURI et al. [14] administered
a 10-day course of antibiotics to all participants who were randomised to the control group, while in all
other studies the responsible physician, who was unaware of the procalcitonin levels of the participants,
had to decide on the administration (or not) of antibiotics, based on the severity of the presentation,
clinical signs and symptoms and biochemical and radiological results.
Risk of bias assessment
Detailed assessment of the risk of bias is depicted in figure 1 and online supplementary appendices 3 and
4. In brief, overall risk of bias was considered high for all included studies, mainly due to performance and
detection bias, as none of the included studies was double blinded and the outcomes assessment was only
blinded in two studies [13, 24]. Furthermore, three of the included trials were quasi-randomised, and
consequently at high risk of selection bias [19, 20, 22]. Finally, target study population was not reached in
one of the trials due to slow recruitment rate [14], while power studies were not reported in two others
[20, 21]. Publication bias was not assessed, because of the relatively small number of studies that
contributed to each of the preselected outcomes.

 Data synthesis and quality assessment
Overall effect estimates for each outcome are presented in figure 2 and online supplementary appendix
5. Detailed assessment of the quality of evidence is included in the evidence profile table in online
supplementary appendix 6. A summary of findings is presented in table 1.
Five studies assessed the rate of treatment failure for the index exacerbation, which was defined as symptom
deterioration, non-improvement, admission to ICU or death within 1–4 weeks of recruitment [13, 14, 19,
21, 24]. Treatment failure was observed in 163 out of 834 included patients and no difference was found
between the treatment groups (RR 0.81, 0.62–1.06; I2=0%, low quality). Only one study, based on a very
small number of observations, assessed the proportion of patients who required antibiotic prescription after
an initial opposite decision and it did not detect any between-group difference (RR 0.92, 0.21–4.12) [13].
The length of hospital stay for the index exacerbation was reported in all included trials (1062
participants). The mean length varied between 4.5 and 16.06 days in the procalcitonin-guided groups and
between 5 and 19.41 days in the control groups. Overall, no significant between-group difference was
observed (MD −0.76, −1.95–0.43; I2=59%, moderate quality).
Antibiotic exposure for the index exacerbation was assessed by the proportion of patients who were
prescribed antibiotics on admission (or patients who did not discontinue early) and the mean duration of the
antibiotic courses. The proportion of patients who received full courses of antibiotics, including patients who
were prescribed antibiotics on admission or patients who were not discontinued early, in accordance with
each study protocol, was reported in seven of the included trials [13, 14, 19, 21–24], which evaluated 984
patients in total and suggested a 44% decrease in the antibiotic prescription rate with procalcitonin-guided
protocols (RR 0.56, 0.43–0.73; I2=84%, moderate quality). Heterogeneity is resolved by excluding the studies
by NANGIA and GANDHI [21] and VERDURI et al. [14], in which antibiotics were administered to all participants
in the control group. The exclusion of these studies had no impact on the overall estimate.
The length of antibiotic exposure for the index exacerbation in days was assessed by six studies [14, 19, 21–24],
with an overall study population of 776 participants. A significant decrease of ∼4 days in length of antibiotic
exposure was demonstrated in the intervention group compared to standard care (MD −3.83, −4.32–−3.35;
I2=58%, moderate quality). This corresponds to a 43% decrease in antibiotic exposure, given that the mean
length of antibiotic exposure in standard care groups was 6.68 days. Two trials assessed the total antibiotic
exposure at longest follow-up. STOLZ et al. [13] found a reduction in the proportion of patients who received
antibiotics during 6 months of follow-up (RR 0.76, 0.64–0.92), while NANGIA and GANDHI [21] found a decrease
in the overall length of antibiotic exposure during 6 weeks of follow-up (MD −4.92, −5.94–−3.90).
The re-exacerbation and re-hospitalisation rates at the longest follow-up did not differ significantly
between the treatment arms. Three studies, including 496 patients, presented the proportion of the
participants who had at least one exacerbation during follow-up (RR 0.96, 0.69–1.35; I2=0%, low quality)
[14, 20, 24]; no between-group difference was found. Three trials (n=398 participants) assessed the
re-hospitalisation rate at longest-follow-up and suggested a trend towards increased rate in the intervention
group (RR 1.45, 0.92–2.29; I2=0%, low quality) [14, 19, 21]. However, two of these trials also assessed the
rate of re-hospitalisation due to an exacerbation at longest follow-up and this was similar between groups
(RR 1.22, 0.71–2.09; I2=0%, low quality) [14, 19].
Finally, mortality at longest follow-up was presented in all included trials (1062 participants). No
significant difference was found between study arms (RR 0.99, 0.58–1.69; I2=0%, moderate quality).
Sensitivity analyses
All studies included were deemed to be at high risk of bias, and as such we were not able to perform
sensitivity analyses using studies with low risk of bias. However, the trial by LIU and ZHANG [20] was found
to be at a significantly higher risk of bias compared to the other included trials (high risk of bias in five
out of seven domains assessed and questionable risk of bias for one additional domain). Thus, in an
additional analysis, we excluded data from LIU and ZHANG [20]; this did not affect any of the results.
Our results proved robust to each of the remaining predefined sensitivity analyses. Finally, we repeated all
analyses excluding data from the trial by NANGIA and GANDHI [21], who used a different cut-point value of
procalcitonin (0.5 μg·L−1) compared to the remaining trials, but this did not affect any of the results.
Discussion
The use of procalcitonin-based protocols to guide the decision to administer antibiotics has been evaluated
previously in infections of different origins and in different settings [8–10]. A well-conducted systematic
review supported the effectiveness of procalcitonin-guided protocols in lower respiratory tract infections,
based on evidence of moderate quality according to GRADE assessment [11]. However, these results do not

 necessary imply that such protocols would also be effective in patients presenting with AECOPD, since the
chronically elevated baseline inflammatory status and the chronic bacterial colonisation of the airways of
patients with COPD [12] could possibly affect the serum procalcitonin levels. We conducted a systematic
review and meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of procalcitonin-based protocols in patients
presenting with AECOPD. Our findings suggest that procalcitonin-based protocols may be superior to
standard care in these patients. More specifically, we showed that procalcitonin guidance significantly limits
and targets the antibiotic exposure, without any obvious impact on the clinical outcomes (such as treatment
success, re-exacerbation, re-hospitalisation or mortality). However, the quality of available data is low to
moderate, suggesting that additional appropriately powered confirmatory trials with rigorous methodology
are required before recommending introducing such strategies in daily clinical practice.
Such an intervention could make a significant difference in the management of patients with AECOPD.
Currently, owing to the challenges of distinguishing bacterially induced AECOPD from AECOPD with
other aetiology in the acute phase, both antibiotics and oral corticosteroids are administered to most
patients presenting with what is regarded a moderate or severe AECOPD. Nevertheless, the aetiology of
AECOPD varies and bacterial infections, where antibiotics are indicated, appear to account for
approximately half of them [3]. This suggests that antibiotics are significantly overused in AECOPD,
posing significant risks to individual patients and society [6]. Importantly, COPD patients are more prone
to the risks associated with overuse of antibiotics, because of chronic airway colonisation with bacterial
strains which tend to progressively become less sensitive to antibiotics. In addition, some of these patients
may be more prone to infections, due to defects in their immune system [25], and this will expose them to
frequent administration of antibiotics in any case.
The majority of patients with moderate or severe AECOPD also receive courses of oral corticosteroids.
Previous studies have shown that oral corticosteroids confer mild or moderate advantage over placebo when
administered in unselected patients with AECOPD [26, 27]. However, they are also associated with numerous
well-known adverse events, such as the risk of pneumonia. It has been hypothesised that oral steroids may be
efficacious in patients with inflammatory, non-infective exacerbations, and not in AECOPD induced by
bacteria [28]. However, this has not yet been evaluated in an RCT, probably due to the challenges of the
identification of the type of exacerbation in the acute phase. All in all, it appears that procalcitonin-based
protocols could contribute to the personalisation of the management of COPD exacerbations, decrease the
use of both antibiotics and oral corticosteroids and may enable the design and conduct of new clinical studies
that will provide new insights into the mechanisms and management of AECOPD.
A number of previous studies failed to demonstrate clinically significant benefits of the administration of
antibiotics in AECOPD, leading some experts to question their usefulness [29]. However, well-conducted
meta-analyses of RCTs suggested small but significant decreases in treatment failure and mortality rates and
time to recovery [30, 31]. Moreover, all these trials and meta-analyses included unselected exacerbations, and
only half of them are anticipated to have been induced by bacteria and responsive to antibiotics. This suggests
that the real magnitude of effects in bacterially induced exacerbations has been significantly underestimated.
Others proposed that a sensible and strict antibiotic stewardship policy alone might effectively reduce
antibiotic administration in patients presenting with AECOPD. However, previous extensive campaigns
against inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in respiratory tract infections led to only modest decrease in
the prescription rates [32, 33]. In addition, a subanalysis of the extensive European COPD Audit [5]
reported that 61.4% of the included (hospitalised) AECOPD were fulfilling Global Initiative for Chronic
Obstructive Lung Disease criteria for antibiotic administration. In our meta-analysis, only 45.6% of the
participants who were hospitalised for AECOPD received antibiotics following procalcitonin-guided
protocols; this suggests procalcitonin guidance might confer an additional decrease in antibiotic
prescription (⩽15%), compared to effective stewardship.
Recent cross-sectional studies noted significant discrepancies between procalcitonin levels and sputum
culture results and raised concerns regarding the effectiveness of procalcitonin protocols to guide antibiotic
administration in patients with COPD [34, 35]. However, this study design is not appropriate to assess
procalcitonin protocols, and, more importantly, the sensitivity and specificity of sputum cultures to
recognise AECOPD induced by bacteria is far from ideal. First, the airways of COPD patients are
frequently colonised with bacteria, which may result in false positive results [36]. Second, the sensitivity of
sputum cultures is limited in patients with COPD [37].
An additional relevant RCT did support our findings, although it did not meet the eligibility criteria. WANG
et al. [38], in a blinded RCT involving 194 patients presenting with AECOPD and procalcitonin levels
<0.1 μg·L−1, compared antibiotics versus control and found similar success rates and similar safety
outcomes 30 days after discharge. These results oppose the use of antibiotics in patients with AECOPD and
low procalcitonin levels.

 A meta-analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of the use of serum procalcitonin to guide antibiotic
therapy in other infections and estimated the cost of procalcitonin to be ∼£11 (€14) per measurement in
the United Kingdom [26]. We consider this an acceptable cost, given the expected net benefits in the
management of patients with an AECOPD.
We recognise that our meta-analysis has some limitations. First, a high risk of bias is introduced by the fact
that none of the included trials were double blinded. The reasons probably include challenges in the design
of a double-blinded trial to assess a biomarker-guided protocol (complexity in the allocation of appropriate
treatment for each patient, challenges in blinding clinicians to laboratory results, etc.), significant associated
costs and, for the earlier studies, lack of adequate safety data to support a double-blinded design (clinicians
could deviate from the protocol in all included studies). Second, our results are imprecise, due to the low
overall study population and event rates. Imprecision was judged using the optimal information size
criterion, the study population generated by conventional power calculation for a single, adequately
powered trial, in accordance with the GRADE guidance [18]. For all clinically important outcomes of
exacerbations, we used narrow non-inferiority margins (2% for mortality and 5% for other outcomes) in the
calculation of the optimal information size. Most trials use less strict criteria (i.e. 5% and 10%, respectively)
and such criteria would have not resulted in downgrading the quality of evidence for imprecision. However,
we consider strict margins more appropriate in the setting of a meta-analysis and we wanted to account for
the relatively low adherence to the procalcitonin-based protocols that was observed in some of the included
trials. Consequently, our results are of low-to-moderate quality, according to GRADE, suggesting that
additional, well-designed and conducted trials are required to confirm our findings.
However, all outcomes support the intervention and all included studies presented consistent results.
These observations can reassure that procalcitonin protocols are very unlikely to be associated with
significant risks and highlight the need for further more rigorous research with the aim of introducing this
intervention to clinical practice in the near future.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that procalcitonin-based protocols to guide the initiation (or discontinuation) of
antibiotics in patients presenting with acute exacerbations of COPD appear to be clinically effective and
safe. The quality of the available evidence is low to moderate, because of the methodological limitations and
small study populations of the available trials. Given the potential impact on the management of these
patients, the need for additional appropriately designed and powered confirmatory randomised controlled
trials cannot be stressed enough.
