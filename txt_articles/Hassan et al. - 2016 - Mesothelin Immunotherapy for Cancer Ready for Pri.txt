Mesothelin is a tumor antigen that is highly expressed in many human cancers, including malignant
mesothelioma and pancreatic, ovarian, and lung adenocarcinomas. It is an attractive target for cancer
immunotherapy because its normal expression is limited to mesothelial cells, which are dispensable.
Several antibody-based therapeutic agents as well as vaccine and T-cell therapies directed at mesothelin
are undergoing clinical evaluation. These include antimesothelin immunotoxins (SS1P, RG7787/LMB-100),
chimeric antimesothelin antibody (amatuximab), mesothelin-directed antibody drug conjugates (anetumab
ravtansine, DMOT4039A, BMS-986148), live attenuated Listeria monocytogenes–expressing mesothelin
(CRS-207, JNJ-64041757), and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies. Two antimesothelin agents are
currently in multicenter clinical registration trials for malignant mesothelioma: amatuximab in the first-line
setting and anetumab ravtansine as second-line therapy. Phase II randomized clinical trials of CRS-207 as
a boosting agent and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibition for pancreatic cancer are nearing
completion. These ongoing studies will define the utility of mesothelin immunotherapy for treating cancer.

INTRODUCTION
Mesothelin (MSLN) is a tumor-differentiation
antigen discovered by Ira Pastan and Mark
Willingham at the National Cancer Institute
more than 20 years ago.1,2 It is a cell-surface gly-
coprotein with normal expression limited to me-
sothelial cells lining the pleura, peritoneum, and
pericardium but is also highly expressed in many
cancers, including malignant mesothelioma,
pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, lung adeno-
carcinoma, endometrial cancer, biliary cancer,
gastric cancer, and pediatric acute myeloid leu-
kemia.3-11 There are few tumor-specific antigens
that are used to therapeutically target solid tu-
mors, because most of them are also expressed
on critical tissues. Because MSLN is expressed
only on dispensable tissues, the risk of nonspecific
toxicity is decreased. Since our initial report
in 1999 that indium-111–labeled anti-MSLN
monoclonal antibody K1 localizes to MSLN-
expressing tumor xenografts in mice, it has been
shown that anti-MSLN monoclonal antibodies
do localize to MSLN-positive solid tumors in
patients.12-14 In addition, preclinical studies as well
as results from initial clinical trials have validated
MSLN as an attractive target for cancer therapy
with antibody-based approaches as well as tumor
vaccines.15
The first patient to receive an MSLN-targeted
therapy was a patient with ovarian cancer treated
by Raffit Hassan in 2000 with the anti-MSLN
agent SS1P.16 Since then, there has been a re-
markable proliferation of drugs targeting MSLN.
Many are in advanced stages of clinical testing,
including randomized trials for mesothelioma
and pancreatic cancer. The discovery of MSLN
and its validation as a target for cancer therapy
have been previously described.15 This review will
focus on important therapeutic approaches as
well as ongoing clinical trials and discuss the
broad implications of targeting MSLN for cancer
therapy.
MSLN
MSLN is a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) –linked
cell-surface glycoprotein. It is synthesized as a 71-kD
precursor protein and is then cleaved by the
endoprotease furin to release the secreted N-terminal
region, called megakaryocyte potentiating factor
(MPF), whereas the 41-kD mature MSLN remains
attached to the membrane.2,17 The remaining GPI-
linked mature MSLN can also be shed from the cell
through the action of the tumor necrosis factor
a–converting enzyme protease.18 The normal
physiologic distribution of MSLN identifies it as

 a differentiation factor for mesothelial cells, but the biologic role
that MSLN plays in these cells remains unclear. Database searches
reveal that MSLN is remotely homologous to two inner ear pro-
teins of unknown structure and contains no conserved consensus
domains.19 Three-dimensional structure prediction programs have
determined that MSLN consists of a superhelical structure with
armadillo-type repeats.20 No crystal structure has yet been de-
termined for the whole protein, but the structure of an N-terminal
fragment bound to a Fab of the SS1 antibody has been obtained.21
Furthermore, MSLN knockout mice grow and reproduce normally
and have no detectable phenotype.22
MSLN is expressed by many solid tumors, with particularly
robust expression in mesothelioma, epithelial ovarian cancer, and
pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Table 1).23-46 Higher expression of
MSLN has been correlated with poorer prognosis for patients with
ovarian cancer,35 cholangiocarcinoma,41,42 lung adenocarcinoma,8,9
triple-negative breast cancer,10,45 and resectable pancreatic
adenocarcinoma.32,33 In the neoplastic setting, MSLN is known
to bind to the ovarian cancer antigen MUC16 (cancer anti-
gen 125).47 The two proteins are frequently coexpressed, and
binding of MSLN and MUC16 has been shown to induce cell-to-
cell adhesion in these cell types.48 MUC16 expressed on cancer
cells can also facilitate cancer cell attachment to the MSLN-
expressing serosal surfaces in the pleura and peritoneum, possibly
contributing to peritoneal seeding and metastatic spread. In
addition, signaling mediated by MSLN and MUC16 binding
has been reported to increase cellular resistance to anoikis,49
upregulate matrix metalloproteinases important in cellular in-
vasion and metastasis,50-52 and induce secretion of autocrine
growth factors by constitutively activating nuclear factor kappa
B (NF-kB).53,54 However, it seems that MSLN expression may
also trigger signaling events independent of MUC16 binding.51
The exact mechanics of these pathways and how MSLN interacts
with components of the tumor microenvironment, including stromal
cells, the extracellular matrix, and immune-cell populations, are not
known.
Why MSLN, a glycoprotein normally restricted to serosal cells
of the pleura, peritoneum, and pericardium, is expressed in a wide
variety of adenocarcinomas is not clear at this time. However,
regulation of MSLN expression in tumors has been assessed in
several studies and seems to be cell-type specific. At the epigenetic
level, it was found that hypomethylation did not correlate with
MSLN expression in ovarian or endometrial cancer specimens44 or
in mesothelioma.27 However, hypomethylation of the promoter
was noted in MSLN-expressing pancreatic cancer specimens, and
treatment of a nonexpressing pancreatic cancer cell line with
demethylating agents could induce expression of MSLN, sug-
gesting that epigenetic mechanisms may regulate MSLN expression
in this cell type.55 Transcription of MSLN is driven by a TATA-less
promoter located upstream of the transcriptional start site. En-
hancers responsible for initiating strong expression in normal
serosal cells and cancers derived from them (eg, mesothelioma and
ovarian cancer) are unknown. Cancer-specific ectopic upregula-
tion in pancreatic and cervical cancers has been attributed to the
transcriptional enhancer factor 1 (TEF-1) transcription factor
binding to a conventional MCAT sequence within an upstream
enhancer region called CanScript. However, TEF-1 expression
itself is necessary but not sufficient to induce MSLN expression,

 suggesting an unknown cofactor is also required.56 Similarly, the
yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) transcription factor binds to an
SP-1 motif within the CanScript and is also required but in-
sufficient for MSLN expression.57 Further study will be required to
delineate this mechanism. More recently, it was discovered that
MSLN is reciprocally regulated at the post-transcriptional level by
mIR-198 as part of a feedback loop that involves NF-kB and the
homeobox transcription factors octamer transcription factor 2
(OCT-2), pre–B cell leukemia homeobox 1 (PBX-1), and valosin-
containing protein (VCP).58
STRATEGIES TO TARGET MSLN
The high cell-surface expression of MSLN in many cancers lends
itself to tumor-specific targeting using monoclonal antibodies,
by themselves or carrying protein toxins or low–molecular weight
cytotoxic agents, as well as by chimeric T cells containing Fv frag-
ments that recognize MSLN (Fig 1). Other approaches in advanced
clinical trials include vaccines that can induce T-cell immune re-
sponse to MSLN.
Immunotoxins
SS1P is a recombinant protein therapeutic that consists of
a high-affinity disulfide-bonded Fv that targets MSLN fused to
a Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) payload.59,60 SS1P binds to MSLN
and is internalized by the cell through endocytosis. The toxin is
delivered to the cytosol, where it irreversibly modifies elongation
factor-2 to halt protein synthesis and induce apoptosis.61 SS1P
has been tested as a single agent as well as in combination with
chemotherapy.16,62,63 The dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are cap-
illary leak syndrome, which is a class effect of immunotoxin ther-
apies, and pleuritis, from on-target, but off-tumor, SS1P binding to
mesothelial cells causing inflammation of the normal pleura. The
single-agent maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) is 45 mcg/kg when
administered as a bolus infusion on days 1, 3, and 5.16 Additive
toxicity was not observed in combination with cisplatin plus
pemetrexed chemotherapy.63 Efficacy of SS1P is limited by antidrug
antibody formation, which typically occurs by the end of the first
cycle (three doses) of treatment. For this reason, SS1P is now being
administered in combination with a lymphocyte-depleting condi-
tioning regimen of pentostatin and cyclophosphamide. This delays
antidrug antibody formation and allows patients to receive multiple
effective cycles of SS1P
.64
LMB-100 (previously RG7787 and Ro6927005) is a recently
developed recombinant immunotoxin that also targets MSLN. It
consists of a humanized anti-MSLN Fab fragment with a newly
designed PE (PE24) engineered to be less immunogenic than SS1P.65
It also has decreased toxicity in animal models and shows broad
activity against different MSLN-expressing cancers.66-68 Phase I
clinical trials of LMB-100 have recently opened for treatment of
patients with mesothelioma and pancreatic cancer.
Vaccine
Elizabeth Jaffee’s laboratory at Johns Hopkins was the first
to identify MSLN as a vaccine-induced CD8+ T-cell target using
immunized lymphocytes from patients responding to granulocyte-
macrophage colony-stimulating factor–secreting whole pancre-
atic tumor cell vaccine (GVAX), which expresses multiple anti-
gens. Using an unbiased genomics-based screening approach,
they identified MSLN as a target of vaccine-induced T cells in
patients who were treated with GVAX who also demonstrated
long-term disease-free survival.69,70 Subsequently, in collabora-
tion with scientists at Aduro Biotech, they developed a Listeria
monocytogenes vaccine expressing MSLN (LM-mesothelin) and
demonstrated in preclinical models that GVAX was the best
priming vaccine and LM-mesothelin was the best boosting vaccine
for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. These studies led to the clinical
development of an LM-mesothelin for other cancers expressing
MSLN.

Mesothelin Immunotherapy for Cancer
 CRS-207 is a recombinant live-attenuated, double-deleted L
monocytogenes engineered to secrete MSLN into the cytosol of
infected antigen presentation cells.71 The bacteria retain the po-
tency of the fully virulent pathogen but have vastly reduced toxicity
as compared with wild-type Listeria because of the selective de-
letion of two virulence factors: ActA (DactA) and internalin B
(DinlB). This blocks the direct internalin B–mediated infection of
nonphagocytic cells, such as hepatocytes, and the indirect ActA-
mediated infection by cell-to-cell spread from adjacent phagocytic
cells. LM provides potent stimulation of innate immunity and also
stimulates an adaptive immune response through recruitment and
activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells specific for encoded heter-
ologous antigens. Listeria DactA/DinlB-based vaccines were rapidly
cleared from mice after immunization and induced potent and
durable effector and memory T-cell responses with no measurable
liver toxicity. In a phase I study, CRS-207 was well tolerated at doses
up to a maximum planned dose of 1 3 1010 colony-forming
units.72 Immune activation and induction of MSLN-specific T-cell
responses were observed.
Chimeric Monoclonal Antibody
Amatuximab (previously MORAb-009) is a chimeric high-
affinity monoclonal immunoglobulin G1/k antibody targeting
MSLN.73 In vitro, amatuximab mediates inhibition of MSLN-
dependent cell adhesion and antibody-dependent cellular cytotox-
icity. Although it has moderate antitumor activity as a monotherapy
against MSLN-expressing tumor xenografts in vivo, this effect is
markedly increased in combination with chemotherapy. In a phase I
trial, the DLTs were transaminitis and serum sickness; the MTD was
determined to be 200 mg/m2.74
Antibody–Drug Conjugates
Anetumab ravtansine (previously BAY 94-9343) is an
antibody–drug conjugate consisting of a human anti-MSLN an-
tibody conjugated to the maytansinoid tubulin inhibitor DM4 via
a disulfide-containing linker. In preclinical studies, anetumab rav-
tansine was shown to be both potent and highly selective in killing
MSLN-expressing tumor cells compared with MSLN-negative
cells.75 The drug is bound and internalized by MSLN-expressing
tumor cells75; degradation of the BAY 94-9343 disulfide-based
linker releases a cell-permeable DM4 metabolite with bystander
killing potential. In vivo, anetumab ravtansine localizes specifi-
cally to MSLN-expressing tumors and inhibits tumor growth in
pancreatic, ovarian, and mesothelioma cancer models. The MTD
of anetumab ravtansine in a phase I trial was 6.5 mg/kg administered
once every 3 weeks intravenously.76 DLTs were keratitis and pe-
ripheral neuropathy. These adverse events were reversible and not life
threatening, but they required dose reduction in approximately
half of all patients. DMOT4039A, a humanized immunoglobulin
G1 anti-MSLN monoclonal antibody conjugated to the antimi-
totic agent MMAE has completed phase I testing in patients
with pancreatic and ovarian cancers (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
NCT01469793). The MTD was found to be 2.4 mg/kg when
administered once every 3 weeks and 1 mg/kg when administered
on a once-per-week schedule. DLTs were hyperglycemia, hypo-
phosphatemia, and ileus.77
Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells
To make anti-MSLN chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells,
autologous patient T cells are modified to express an MSLN-
binding T-cell receptor linked to appropriate cosignaling mole-
cules, such that binding of these modified T cells to MSLN on
cancer cells activates the cells to attack the tumor.78,79 Given
concerns that targeting MSLN could cause serositis, as is seen with
the immunotoxin SS1P, an mRNA electroporation technique was
used to engineer the anti-MSLN CAR T cells used in the initial
clinical study, because this method produces only transient ex-
pression of the CAR (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT1355965).
Data from two patients in this study have been reported; both
patients experienced transient responses, and neither developed
serositis.80 Given these promising results, two trials of anti-MSLN
CAR T cells engineered by typical viral transduction methods have
been initiated (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT01583686 and
NCT02159716). More recently, it was also shown in preclinical
studies that intrapleural infusion of anti-MSLN CAR T cells could
enhance cell persistence and induce more durable responses81;
a clinical trial of this delivery method is now open (ClinicalTrials.
gov identifier NCT02414269). Because there have been recent
reviews describing results from ongoing clinical trials as well as
future directions of these therapeutics,78,79 CART-cell clinical trials
are not discussed in the remainder of this review.
CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT OF MSLN-TARGETED THERAPIES
Multiple clinical trials are currently evaluating different anti-MSLN
agents for cancer therapy. Most of the efforts thus far have focused
on malignant mesothelioma, pancreatic cancer, and ovarian cancer
(Table 2).
Mesothelioma
Because a majority of malignant mesotheliomas have high and
uniform cell-surface expression of MSLN, this disease is an es-
pecially good target for MSLN-directed therapies. However, sar-
comatoid mesotheliomas, which constitute approximately 10%
to 15% of all mesotheliomas, are not eligible for these therapies,
because they lack MSLN expression. There are currently more than
10 clinical trials of anti-MSLN agents for treating mesothelioma,
including one first-line registration trial and one registration trial
in the second-line setting.
SS1P clinical trials. The anti-MSLN immunotoxin SS1P has
been extensively evaluated in this tumor type. In the phase I clinical
trials of SS1P, patients with mesothelioma were treated on an
every-other-day bolus schedule16 and on a continuous-infusion
schedule.62 These studies established the safety of MSLN as a target
for cancer therapy. The DLT was pleuritis because of expression of
MSLN on mesothelial cells lining the pleura. Surprisingly, patients
did not develop pericarditis. However, antitumor activity was
limited because most patients developed neutralizing antibodies
against the toxin portion of SS1P and could not receive additional
effective treatment cycles. On the basis of laboratory studies, two
different approaches were pursued to increase the efficacy of SS1P.
Given the remarkable antitumor synergy between SS1P and
chemotherapy in vivo, SS1P was tested in combination with

 pemetrexed and cisplatin as first-line therapy for pleural meso-
thelioma.63 Patients who were not candidates for curative surgical
resection received pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2
on day 1 of a 21-day cycle for a maximum of six cycles; SS1P 45 mg/kg
was administered on days 1, 3, and 5 during cycles one and two only.
This study demonstrated the safety of the combination. The most
common SS1P-related toxicities included hypoalbuminemia, fatigue,
hypotension, and edema. Of the 20 evaluable patients treated in this
study, 12 (60%) experienced objective tumor responses, and three
had stable disease. This study also showed that serum MSLN and
serum MPF levels correlated with radiologic tumor response.
However, the addition of chemotherapy did not delay the for-
mation of anti-SS1P neutralizing antibodies.
Because neutralizing antibodies to immunotoxins limited
their clinical efficacy, strategies were developed to circumvent this.
Single-agent immunosuppressive agents, such as steroids, cyclo-
sporine, and rituximab, were not successful.82 A preclinical study
showed that coadministration of pentostatin and cyclophospha-
mide ended anti-SS1P antibody formation in immunocompetent
mice.83 On the basis of these results, a pilot study was designed in

Mesothelin Immunotherapy for Cancer
 which patients with mesothelioma for whom standard therapies
had failed received pentostatin and cyclophosphamide before SS1P.
Using this approach, only two of 10 patients developed anti-SS1P
antibodies after the first cycle compared with 88% of patients in
prior studies of SS1P alone.64 This regimen induced lymphopenia
without neutropenia, and none of the patients developed oppor-
tunistic infections. More importantly, three of 10 evaluable patients
experienced major cancer regressions that were long lasting. To
avoid use of an immunosuppressive regimen with immunotoxin
therapy, a less immunogenic anti-MSLN immunotoxin, LMB-100
(RG7787), was developed and is now being evaluated in a clin-
ical trial for treatment of patients with mesothelioma for whom
prior chemotherapy has failed (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
NCT02798536).
Amatuximab for pleural mesothelioma. On the basis of the
phase I study of amatuximab in patients with advanced solid
tumors that established its safety74 and laboratory data showing
synergy with chemotherapy in preclinical in vivo models, a phase II
study of amatuximab was initiated in patients with mesotheli-
oma.84 In this nonrandomized trial, 89 patients with malignant
pleural mesothelioma who had received no prior chemotherapy
and were not candidates for surgical resection were treated with
pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1 of a once-
every-3-weeks cycle for six cycles. Amatuximab 5 mg/kg was
administered on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. The primary end
point of this study was improvement of progression-free survival
(PFS). The objective response rate by independent radiologic
review was 40%, and 51% of patients had stable disease, for an
overall disease control rate of 91%. Although the study did not
meet its primary end point of a 6-month PFS response rate of 62%,
the overall survival of patients was 14.8 months, which is better
than historical controls with pemetrexed and cisplatin alone.
Analysis of the pharmacokinetic data showed that serum ama-
tuximab trough concentrations greater than the population me-
dian of 38.2 mg/mL were associated with significant improvement
of both PFS as well as overall survival. Overall survival was 583 days
for patients with amatuximab trough concentrations greater than
38.2 mg/mL versus 375 days for patients with amatuximab trough
concentration less than 38.2 mg/mL.85 Pharmacodynamic mod-
eling shows that administering amatuximab 5 mg/kg once per week
will allow 80% of patients to achieve amatuximab trough con-
centrations greater than 38.2 mg/mL. On the basis of these data,
a randomized phase II registration clinical trial of amatuximab plus
pemetrexed and cisplatin versus pemetrexed and cisplatin for
patients with newly diagnosed unresectable mesothelioma has been
initiated (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02357147).
Anetumab ravtansine trials. Anetumab ravtansine was eval-
uated in a phase I clinical trial in patients with MSLN-expressing
cancers that included an expansion cohort of patients with me-
sothelioma.76 In this trial, anetumab ravtansine was administered
to patients in increasing doses once every 3 weeks; the MTD of
anetumab ravtansine with this schedule was 6.5 mg/kg. The DLTs at
7.5 mg/kg were keratitis and neuropathy. The activity of anetumab
ravtansine in patients with MSLN-positive malignant mesotheli-
oma was evaluated in an expansion cohort. Of 16 patients with
mesothelioma treated at the MTD, five patients (31%) experienced
objective tumor responses, and seven (44%) had stable disease.
However, in patients with pleural mesothelioma who received
anetumab ravtansine as second-line therapy, five (50%) of 10 ex-
perienced objective partial responses, and four (40%) had stable
disease. These results have led to a randomized phase II trial of
anetumab ravtansine as second-line therapy for patients with
mesothelioma (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02610140). In this
registration clinical trial, patients are randomly assigned to ane-
tumab ravtansine 6.5 mg/kg once every 3 weeks versus vinorelbine
30 mg/m2 once per week, with progression-free survival as the
primary end point.
CRS-207 study in pleural mesothelioma. On the basis of
a phase I study showing the safety of CRS-207 and induction of
MSLN-specific T-cell immune response in patients with meso-
thelioma,72 a phase Ib clinical trial of CRS-207 plus pemetrexed
and cisplatin was initiated in patients with pleural mesothelioma
who were not candidates for surgical resection. Patients received
two doses of intravenous CRS-207 2 weeks apart, followed 2 weeks
later by standard doses of pemetrexed and cisplatin for four to six
cycles. Patients achieving a response or stable disease received two
more doses of CRS-207 once every 3 weeks as maintenance. As of
December 2015, 38 patients had been enrolled in the study. The
most common CRS-207 toxicities were similar to those seen in the
phase I trial, consisting mostly of grade 1 fever (79%) and chills or
rigor (82%). Of the 34 evaluable patients treated in the study,
20 (59%) experienced objective partial responses, and 12 (35%)
had stable disease, for a disease control rate of 94%.86
Pancreatic Cancer
Because several studies have shown high expression of MSLN
in pancreatic cancer, different approaches to targeting it are being
evaluated in the clinic, including MSLN vaccine, chimeric anti-
body, and antibody–drug conjugate.
Clinical trials of CRS-207 in pancreatic cancer. A heterologous
prime–boost strategy using cyclophosphamide with GVAX pan-
creas followed by CRS-207 was tested in previously treated patients
with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Cyclophosphamide was ad-
ministered the day before GVAX to inhibit regulatory T cells.
Patients in the comparator arm received cyclophosphamide plus
GVAX alone. Despite a heavily pretreated patient population, there
was an overall survival benefit favoring the prime–boost arm (6.1 v
3.9 months; hazard ratio, 0.59; P = .02).87 A follow-up study
comparing the efficacy of CRS-207 alone versus prime–boost
vaccine versus chemotherapy in patients who had received two or
more prior regimens for metastatic disease was recently completed
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02004262). The primary end
point examining overall survival was not reached, with a median
overall survival of 3.8 months for patients treated with CRS-207
plus GVAX pancreas, 5.4 months for patients treated with CRS-207
alone, and 4.6 months for patients treated with chemotherapy
(D. Le, personal communication, September 2016). Ongoing and
future strategies are aimed at combinatorial strategies with other
immune modulators. A second study testing the prime–boost
strategy with or without programmed death 1 (PD-1) inhibition
is almost complete (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02243371).
Results of these studies will inform further development of these
agents.

 that included patients with previously treated advanced pancreatic
cancer. In this study, MSLN expression was not prospectively
assessed in the majority of enrolled patients; however, the last
10 patients enrolled were required to have 2+ or 3+ expression to
join. Responses were seen in two of 26 patients treated at the
recommended phase II dose.77
On the basis of antitumor efficacy of the antimesothelin
immunotoxin SS1P administered in combination with pentos-
tatin and cyclophosphamide in patients with malignant meso-
thelioma, one study is currently enrolling patients with advanced
previously treated pancreatic cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
NCT01362790). In addition, based on preclinical studies showing
remarkable synergy between nab-paclitaxel and LMB-100, a phase I
clinical trial of this combination has just started accrual for patients
with previously treated pancreatic cancer with progressive disease
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02810418).
Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer
MSLN mRNA and protein are present in a substantial number
of lung adenocarcinomas.8,9,25,30,36 Recent studies have identified
MSLN expression in more than 50% of both early-stage and
advanced lung adenocarcinomas. Kachala et al9 found MSLN
expression in 69% of early-stage (stages I to III) lung adenocar-
cinomas, with approximately 20% of patients strongly expressing
MSLN. Thomas et al8 observed MSLN expression in 53% of ad-
vanced (stages IIIB to IV) lung adenocarcinomas, with high ex-
pression found in approximately 25% of patients. The studies also
indicated that MSLN expression might be an independent driver
of an aggressive tumor phenotype; in both series, high MSLN
expression was independently associated with inferior overall
survival. Tumors with high MSLN expression were also more
likely to have KRAS mutations, compared with tumors with low
MSLN expression. Given its frequent expression and possibly im-
portant role in lung adenocarcinoma growth and dissemination,
MSLN is being actively investigated as a potential therapeutic target
in patients with therapy-resistant lung adenocarcinoma. A phase I
study is evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of JNJ-
64041757, a live attenuated L monocytogenes vaccine in patients
with non–small-cell lung cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
NCT02592967).
Ovarian Cancer
The antibody–drug conjugate DMOT4039A was recently
tested in a phase I study that included patients with platinum-
resistant ovarian cancer.77 In this study, MSLN expression was
prospectively assessed, and 3+ expression by immunohistochemistry
was required for eligibility. Responses were seen in three of 10 patients
treated once every 3 weeks and one of 12 patients treated on the once-
per-week administration schedule.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
There has been substantial progress in the development of different
approaches to target MSLN for cancer therapy. Although there was
initial concern that pericardial toxicity could be limiting in the
development of MSLN-targeted agents because of mesothelin
expression on mesothelial cells lining the pericardium, this has not
been seen in patients. Because MSLN is highly expressed in many
cancers, these therapies could have broad implications for treat-
ment of patients with solid tumors. In the case of malignant
mesothelioma, two drugs are currently in multicenter registration
clinical trials. These include amatuximab plus pemetrexed and
cisplatin versus chemotherapy alone in untreated patients with
unresectable pleural mesothelioma. In the second-line setting,
a randomized clinical trial of anetumab ravtansine versus vinor-
elbine is currently ongoing in patients with pleural mesothelioma
who experienced progression with prior pemetrexed and cisplatin
therapy. Clinical trials of anti-MSLN immunotoxins are also on-
going for previously treated patients with mesothelioma. In the
case of pancreatic cancer, a randomized clinical trial of GVAX
pancreas vaccine and CRS-207 with or without nivolumab is
ongoing in patients with metastatic disease. In addition, the
combination of LMB-100 with nab-paclitaxel is being evaluated in
patients with locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancers
for whom prior therapies have failed. A new clinical trial of an
attenuated L monocytogenes–expressing MSLN is currently ongoing
in lung cancer.
Because some of the MSLN-directed therapies may have
nonoverlapping toxicity with chemotherapy and immunotherapy
agents and could potentially result in synergistic activity, combi-
nation clinical trials have just been initiated. These include ane-
tumab ravtansine with chemotherapy for treatment of patients
with mesothelioma and lung cancer and clinical trials of CRS-207
plus immune checkpoint inhibitors for pancreatic cancer. How-
ever, with regard to combination therapy trials, it will be important
to have good scientific rationale before conducting large-scale
clinical trials. For example, in the case of lung adenocarcinoma, to
combine MSLN-directed agents with immune checkpoint therapy,
it would be important to have a good understanding of coex-
pression of MSLN as well as programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1).
Furthermore, additional clinical trials for some of the agents we
have described are being planned for assessment in additional
cancers with MSLN expression, such as gastric cancer, endometrial
cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, and triple-negative breast cancer.
Finally, it is imperative to identify and validate companion assays
to detect tumor MSLN expression.
