Abstract
Objective: The hormones glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), peptide YY3-36 (PYY3-36), ghrelin, glucose-dependent 
insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon have all been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity. However, it is 
unknown whether they exhibit adaptive changes with respect to postprandial secretion to a sustained weight loss.
Design: The study was designed as a longitudinal prospective intervention study with data obtained at baseline, after 
8 weeks of weight loss and 1 year after weight loss.
Methods: Twenty healthy obese individuals obtained a 13% weight loss by adhering to an 8-week very low-calorie 
diet (800 kcal/day). After weight loss, participants entered a 52-week weight maintenance protocol. Plasma levels of 
GLP-1, PYY3-36, ghrelin, GIP and glucagon during a 600-kcal meal were measured before weight loss, after weight 
loss and after 1 year of weight maintenance. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated as total AUC (tAUC) and 
incremental AUC (iAUC).
Results: Weight loss was successfully maintained for 52 weeks. iAUC for GLP-1 increased by 44% after weight loss 
(P < 0.04) and increased to 72% at week 52 (P = 0.0001). iAUC for PYY3-36 increased by 74% after weight loss (P<0.0001) 
and by 36% at week 52 (P = 0.02). tAUC for ghrelin increased by 23% after weight loss (P<0.0001), but at week 52, 
the increase was reduced to 16% compared with before weight loss (P = 0.005). iAUC for GIP increased by 36% after 
weight loss (P = 0.001), but returned to before weight loss levels at week 52. Glucagon levels were unaffected by 
weight loss.
Conclusions: Meal responses of GLP-1 and PYY3-36 remained increased 1 year after weight maintenance, whereas 
ghrelin and GIP reverted toward before-weight loss values. Thus, an increase in appetite 
inhibitory mechanisms and a partly decrease in appetite-stimulating mechanisms appear to 
contribute to successful long-term weight loss maintenance.
Introduction
Weight regain after weight loss represents an unsolved 
challenge (1, 2). Thus, identification of hormonal 
changes associated with maintained weight loss is 
important as they may support or counteract successful 
long-term weight loss maintenance. The gut-derived 
incretin hormone, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), may – 
together with peptide YY3-36 (PYY3-36) – be a key mediator 
in postmeal satiety and thus the limitation of energy 
intake (3). The effect involves both peripheral and central 
mechanisms (4, 5). The postprandial GLP-1 response 
is attenuated in obese individuals (6, 7, 8), and recent 
studies have indicated that the impairment may be an 
early feature of obesity, as low GLP-1 responses are seen 
in overweight people independent of glucose tolerance

status (9). In obesity, an inverse relationship between 
postprandial GLP-1 and insulin levels has been proposed, 
suggesting that insulin resistance may promote further 
weight gain through an impaired GLP-1 response (7). 
The observations regarding the effect of weight reduction 
on meal-induced GLP-1 responses in obesity are mainly 
derived from studies of obese subjects investigated after 
bariatric surgery, showing that postprandial GLP-1 levels 
are higher after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) than 
after laparoscopic assisted gastric bypass (10, 11). This 
observation may in part explain the higher degree of 
weight loss in RYGB compared with adjustable gastric 
banding patients (12). The secretory GLP-1 response to 
a meal after long-term weight reduction (up to a year) 
is unknown, and only few studies have examined the 
acute effect of diet-induced weight loss on basal and 
postprandial GLP-1 levels. Verdich et al. demonstrated an 
attenuated postprandial GLP-1 response in obese subjects, 
which was significantly increased after a 6-month 15% 
diet-induced weight loss and appeared to be intermediate 
between the GLP-1 responses for obese and lean subjects, 
pointing toward a gradual normalization of GLP-1 
responses with weight loss (7). However, other weight 
loss intervention studies have reported decreased (13, 14, 
15) and unaltered (16) postprandial GLP-1 levels after a 
diet-induced weight loss.
PYY3-36 is another gut-derived satiety hormone, and 
postprandial levels are attenuated in obesity (17), perhaps 
in agreement with the finding that it is secreted together 
with GLP-1 from the intestinal L cells (18). The effect of 
weight loss on PYY3-36 levels is, however, less clear, and 
both decreased (15) and unchanged (19) levels have been 
reported. Both fasting (20) and postprandial levels (21) 
increase after gastric bypass, and again, the effect seems 
to be larger after RYGB than after gastric banding.
The incretin hormone, glucose-dependent insulin-
otropic polypeptide (GIP), is secreted from the upper 
small intestine (22). In mice, GIP has been shown to 
promote energy storage via direct actions on adipose 
tissue by enhancing the activity of lipoprotein lipase 
(LPL) and to promote insulin-dependent free fatty 
acid uptake in adipocytes (23). Furthermore, a study 
has shown that GIP receptor knockout mice have 
reduced subcutaneous adipose tissue, improved insulin 
sensitivity, and were resistant to diet-induced obesity 
(24). However, a recent study examining 1405 individuals 
at low to high risk of developing type 2 diabetes found 
that high fasting GIP levels were associated with lower 
LDL levels, independent of insulin, indicating that 
high GIP levels may promote lipid clearance from the 
blood (25). GIP probably does not possess any appetite-
regulating properties, but levels have been suggested to 
be exaggerated in obesity and diabetes (26). The effect 
of weight loss on GIP levels is not well established in 
obesity, and both lower (7) and higher postprandial 
levels (27) have been reported.
The orexigenic hormone, ghrelin, is primarily secreted 
from the stomach and duodenum (28), and responds 
rapidly to a negative energy balance. Thus, after diet-
induced weight loss, fasting ghrelin concentrations and, 
in parallel, feelings of hunger, increase (29). Therefore, 
ghrelin has been suggested to be involved in both short-
term (meal initiation and termination) and long-term 
regulation of appetite and body weight (30).
Finally, the pancreatic hormones, glucagon and insulin, 
have also been suggested to be involved in satiety (31). 
Early studies have shown that administration of glucagon 
may reduce appetite in humans (32), but the physiological 
relevance of these findings has not been confirmed. 
However, combined administration of low doses of GLP-1 
and glucagon inhibited food intake significantly and 
induced c-fos expression in the area postrema and amygdala 
in mice (33), and co-infusion of GLP-1 and glucagon has 
been shown to reduce food intake in humans (34).
Thus, the responses of appetite-regulating hormones 
after diet-induced weight loss remain unclear, and most 
studies have only assessed short-term effects of weight 
reduction. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess 
meal-induced responses of the gastrointestinal hormones: 
GLP-1, GIP, PYY3-36, ghrelin as well as the pancreatic 
hormones glucagon and insulin, both acutely and after 
1 
year of diet-induced weight loss maintenance in order 
to identify hormonal changes associated with maintained 
weight loss.
Subjects and methods
Twenty obese non-type 2 diabetic individuals (BMI: 
30.0 
– 
39.9 kg/m2) aged 18–65 years were recruited for the 
study. Participants suffering from acute or chronic illnesses 
(including diabetes) or participants taking any form of 
medical treatment with known effects on glucose and 
lipid metabolism were excluded before entering the study. 
See previously published article (35) for a detailed study 
description.

of 810 kcal/day for 8 weeks. Products were provided by 
the Cambridge Diet (Cambridge Weight Plan, Corby, 
UK) (36). The low-calorie diet program consisted of a 
powdered formula mixture dissolved in skimmed milk or 
water. The program met all recommendations for daily 
intake of essential amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, and 
minerals. During the weight loss phase, the participants 
had weekly consultations with the dietician who assisted 
them in achieving a body weight loss above 7.5%, which 
was required in order to continue into the 52-week weight 
loss maintenance program.
Weight loss maintenance phase
After 8 weeks on the low-calorie diet, the study 
participants 
followed 
Cambridge 
Weight 
Loss 
Maintenance Program with Cambridge Weight Plan 
products. Study participants were instructed to restrict 
calorie intake after calculation of their estimated daily 
energy need (from the Schofield equation (37) multiplied 
with the individual physical activity level score) and 
subsequently subtracted by 600 kcal (mean daily energy 
requirement subtracted by 600 kcal was 1395 ± 31 kcal, 
 
95% CI (1267 – 1893). During the 52 weeks, the 
participants attended 13 consultations with the 
clinical dietician in which they received education 
on diet and lifestyle changes and were encouraged to 
follow the ‘Nordic Nutrition Recommendations’ (38). 
The participants kept track on their energy intake by 
recording this in a diet calendar which they brought 
to the consultations. In case of weight gain, up to 
 
two meals a day during the weight loss maintenance 
period were allowed to be replaced by Cambridge 
Weight Plan products to ensure a stable maintenance 
of weight loss. 
Meal test
The study participants completed a 3-h meal test before 
weight loss, after weight loss, and after 52 weeks of weight 
loss maintenance. After an overnight fast (10 
– 
12 
h), 
participants were placed resting in a recumbent position, 
and a cannula was inserted into a cubital vein for blood 
sampling. After fasting blood samples were drawn, the 
participants ingested an energy-dense nutrient drink 
(Fresubin; Fresenius Kabi Deutschland GmbH, Bad 
Homburg, Germany) of 600 kilo calories (20% protein, 
30% fat, and 50% carbohydrate). The meal was consumed 
over a period of 15 min. For each meal test, venous blood 
samples were drawn 10, 5, and 0 min before (fasting state) 
and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min after meal intake.
Outcome measures
Plasma PYY3-36 and total plasma ghrelin were measured 
by radioimmunoassay (Millipore). All quality controls 
were within the prespecified limits. Radioimmunological 
determinations of total plasma GLP-1, total plasma 
GIP (total 
= 
sum of the active hormone and the primary 
metabolites, GLP-1 (9-36 amide), and GIP (3-42), 
respectively), and plasma glucagon were performed as 
described (39, 40, 41). The assays have a detection limit 
of less than 2 
pmol/L and an intra-assay and inter-assay 
coefficients of variation of less than 6 and 15% respectively. 
Plasma glucose was measured with the glucose oxidase 
technique (YSI 2300 STAT Plus; Yellow Springs Instrument, 
Yellow Springs, OH, USA). Serum insulin concentrations 
were 
measured 
using 
Immulite 
2000 
solid-phase 
chemiluminescent immunometric assays (Immulite 2000; 
Siemens). Body composition (fat and lean body mass) was 
assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning 
(Hologic discovery A, Bedford, MA, USA).
Ethical issues
The study was approved by the ethical committee in 
Copenhagen (reference number: H-4-2010-134) and was 
performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration 
II and with The International Council for Harmonisation 
of Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP). Participation in the 
investigation was voluntary, and the individuals could at 
any time retract their consent to participate (ClinicalTrials.
gov Identifier: NCT02094183).
Statistical analysis
Within-subject variances from before to after weight 
loss and from before weight loss to week 52 were 
analyzed with paired t-tests, and linear regression 
analyses were made with log-transformed values (SPSS 
statistics version 22; IBM). Total and incremental areas 
under the curve (AUC) were calculated using Prism 
Version 5.04 (GraphPad) by the trapezoidal method, 
which is a validated tool for postprandial assessments 
(42). Incremental AUC (iAUC) was defined as the area 
above the baseline (defined by mean hormone levels 
at t = −15, −5, and 0 min before meal ingestion), thus 
covering time points 0 – 180 min.

Incremental AUC was used when there were no 
differences in fasting (from baseline to week 52) whereas 
total AUC was used when there were differences in fasting 
levels in order to account for relevant hormone response.

A two-tailed P-value less than 0.05 was considered 
significant.
Data were tested for normal distribution with the 
Shapiro–Wilk test.
Results
Weight change and body mass composition
After the very-low calorie diet, the study participants 
achieved a total weight loss of 12.5 kg equivalent to 13% 
of initial body weight, P < 0.0001. After 1 year, the study 
participants had maintained their weight loss, with no 
significant weight difference from after initial weight 
loss to week 52 (weight difference: 2.2 kg (95% CI: −1.2 
to 5.6), P = 0.2). Fat mass decreased by 6.3% from before 
to after weight loss (P < 0.0001), and by week 52, the 
total fat mass decrease was 8.3% (P = 0.002) compared 
with before weight loss. Lean body mass (calculated 
without bone mass) increased by 3.8% from before to 
after weight loss (P < 0.0001), and after 52 weeks of 
weight loss maintenance, the lean body mass increased 
additionally by 1.4% to a total of 5.2% (P < 0.0001) from 
before weight loss (Table 1).
Hormonal changes
The incremental area under the GLP-1 response curve 
increased by 44% (P 
= 
0.04) from before to after weight 
loss and increased by additional 28% at week 52, that is, 
a total increase of 72% compared with before weight loss 
(P 
= 
0.0001). Fasting GLP-1 levels remained unchanged 
(Fig. 1A).
Incremental area under the GIP response curve 
increased by 36% (P 
= 
0.001) from before to after weight 
loss, but at week 52, GIP levels had returned to before-
weight loss values (P 
= 
0.9). Fasting GIP levels remained 
unchanged (Fig. 1B). 
The incremental area under the PYY3-36 response 
curve increased by 74% (P 
< 
0.0001) from before to after 
weight loss, and by week 52, the incremental area under 
the curve was increased by 36% from before-weight loss 
values (P 
= 
0.02). Fasting plasma levels of PYY3-36 decreased 
by 13% from before to after weight loss (P 
= 
0.03) but 
reverted to before-weight loss values at week 52 (P 
> 
0.05) 
 
(Fig. 1C). 
Total area under the ghrelin response curve increased 
by 23% from before to after weight loss (P 
< 
0.0001), but 
by week 52, the total increase from before weight loss 
was reduced by 7% to a total of 16% (P 
= 
0.005). Fasting 
ghrelin levels increased by 25% from before to after weight 
loss (P 
< 
0.0001), but at week 52, the increase was reduced 
to 17% from before weight loss (P 
= 
0.01) (Fig. 1D). Meal-
stimulated as well as fasting glucagon levels remained 
unchanged throughout the study period (Fig. 1E).
Total area under the insulin response curve decreased 
by 19% from before to after weight loss (P 
= 
0.02) and 
remained significantly lower throughout the weight loss 
maintenance period (17% lower than before weight loss, 
P 
= 
0.04). Fasting insulin levels decreased by almost 40% 
immediately after weight loss (P 
< 
0.0001) and remained 
low throughout the weight loss maintenance phase, 
although tended to revert toward before-weight loss values 
(17% lower than before weight loss, P 
= 
0.002) (Fig. 
1F).
HOMA-IR decreased significantly from before weight 
loss to after weight loss (estimated difference: −0.96 (95% 
CI: 0.5 – 1.4), P 
< 
0.0001) and remained lower than before 
weight loss after 52 weeks (estimated difference: −0.4 
(95% CI: 0.1 – 0.7), P 
= 
0.01) (Table 2).
The Matsuda index of insulin sensitivity improved 
after weight loss (estimated difference: 0.5 (95% CI: 
0.1 – 0.9), P 
= 
0.016 and tended to remain elevated at week 
52, although not significantly (estimated difference: 0.4 
(95% CI: 0.04 – 0.8), P 
= 
0.08) (Table 2).
Discussion
In this study, we were able to demonstrate that after 1 
year of successful 13% body weight loss maintenance,

Hormonal adaptations to 
weight loss
GLP-1 and PYY3-36 remain significantly increased, whereas 
the orexigenic hormone ghrelin and the lipid-regulating 
hormone GIP after an initial increase revert toward before-
weight loss values. Glucagon levels were not affected by 
weight loss. 
In 1997, Näslund et al. described elevated levels 
of both fasting and postprandial GLP-1, PYY3-36, and 
cholecystokinin (CCK) 20 years after jejunoileal bypass 
surgery. However, it was unsettled whether this increase 
was associated with the weight loss or the operation, 
which in itself induced a change in gut hormone 
secretion due to increased exposure of the terminal ileum 
to food components (45). Today, it is well recognized that 
postprandial GLP-1 and PYY3-36 secretion is increased in 
obese patients after bypass surgery (20). Thus, in patients 
receiving RYGB surgery, the increase in GLP-1 and PYY3-36 
is evident before significant weight loss and is thought to 
be due to the altered transit of nutrients through the gut 
(46). However, it is of notice that in studies of good and 
poor RYGB responders (with larger and smaller weight 
losses, respectively), PYY3-36 and GLP-1 responses were 
associated with the magnitude of the weight loss (47, 48). 
Additionally, it was shown that suppression of GLP-1 and 
PYY3-36 with somatostatin was associated with the return 
of appetite and food intake (48), and it was suggested that 
poor weight loss maintenance might be associated with 
attenuated postprandial responses of PYY3-36 and GLP-1 
compared with patients with sustained weight losses (47, 
48). Thus, these studies might suggest that the ability of 
the patients to secrete the appetite inhibitory hormones 
would predict the resulting weight loss.
Based on the current results, we propose that the 
ability to maintain weight loss depends on the restoration 
of the secretion of the appetite-regulating hormones. 
Furthermore, weight gain may be associated with a 
gradual impairment in the secretion of these hormones, 
initiating a vicious cycle with progressively deteriorating 
appetite regulation. The changes we observe do not seem 
compatible with decreased secretion of the appetite-
regulating hormones as a primary cause of obesity, because 
a primary deficiency would not be expected to disappear 
after weight loss. Thus, the increase in GLP-1 and 
 
PYY3-36 responses after long-term weight loss supports 
 
the concept of decreased hormone responses in obesity 
 
and therefore secondary to the obese state. Accordingly, 
lifting of obesity (and especially reducing fat mass) 
ameliorates impairment of secretion and facilitates 
maintenance of a weight loss. 
We observe a significant improvement in both 
HOMA-IR and the Matsuda index of insulin sensitivity

Hormonal adaptations to 
weight loss
immediately after weight loss, and HOMA-IR remained 
low after 1 year of weight loss maintenance. This supports 
the hypothesis that the GLP-1-secreting L cells exhibit 
insulin sensitivity and thus develop some degree of insulin 
 
resistance in the obese state (49). Accordingly, the 
observed improvement in insulin sensitivity after acute 
and maintained fat mass loss could explain the sustained 
increase in GLP-1 release, supporting the notion of an inverse 
correlation between GLP-1 and insulin (7). PYY3-36 secretion 
showed similar increases along with changes in fasting basal 
secretion, making the pattern less clear. However, it is now 
known that not all L cells secrete both PYY3-36 and GLP-1 – 
 
many particularly proximal L cells secrete only GLP-1 – 
and this may explain the discrepant findings of weight loss 
effects on fasting PYY3-36 and GLP-1 levels (50)
It is well known that obese individuals display 
lower levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin (51) and 
that concentrations rapidly increase during dietary 
restriction and exercise (29, 52). Furthermore, it has been 
suggested that ghrelin plays a role in long-term weight 
maintenance (30). Our results demonstrate that ghrelin 
levels respond rapidly to acute energy restriction, but 
gradually return to before-weight loss values after 1 year 
of weight loss maintenance, indicating that ghrelin is a 
short-term regulator of appetite. Furthermore, that the 
acute ghrelin-mediated appetite stimulation that occurs 
 
during acute weight loss is transient and that long-term 
adaptation to a new weight level does not necessarily 
involve increased ghrelin-mediated appetite stimulation.
The early increased ghrelin levels might be viewed 
as a compensatory mechanism to preserve body 
weight even if excessive. However, after long-term 
weight 
loss 
maintenance, 
ghrelin 
concentrations 
have almost returned to before-weight loss levels, 
which may be viewed as an adaptation response 
and actually helps to facilitate maintenance of the 
new body weight especially combined with the 
sustained increase in the appetite hormones GLP-1 
 
and PYY3-36.
We report a temporary increase in the intestinal 
hormone GIP in acute response to weight loss. Our 
results are in contrast to those of Verdich et al., who 
reported an impaired postprandial GIP response after 
weight loss (7), leading to a hypothesis of exaggerated 
levels in obesity, which become normalized when 
excess body weight is lost (26). Our findings are in 
agreement with the observations by Raben et al., who 
reported an increase in postprandial GIP levels in

Hormonal adaptations to 
weight loss
post-obese women compared with obese controls 
(27). The obesogenic effect of postprandial GIP is well 
described and is probably attributed to the anabolic 
effect of the hormone on adipose tissue rather than a 
centrally mediated effect on appetite regulation (53). 
Although not verified, it could be speculated that, as 
for ghrelin, the acute increases in postprandial GIP 
following weight loss are part of the body’s acute 
compensatory mechanisms to avoid depletion of 
energy stores, and increasing postprandial GIP levels 
represent an attempt to facilitate fat storage. However, 
as for ghrelin, the response is only temporary – when 
weight loss is sustained, postprandial GIP returns to 
before-weight loss levels, thereby, with time, facilitating 
weight maintenance.
Glucagon levels did not change throughout the 
study period, and besides a few early studies (32, 54), 
no documentation for a direct appetite-regulating effect 
in humans has been demonstrated. Thus, we conclude 
that glucagon does not seem to be involved in weight 
loss mechanisms in humans, although it may act 
synergistically in combination with GLP-1 (34).
Finally, a surprising finding in the study was an 
increase in lean body mass during the weight loss program. 
However, the composition of the diet (more protein) 
combined with a possibly increased level of exercise may 
have led to an increase in muscle mass and therefore lean 
body mass.
Strengths and limitations
We were able to introduce and maintain a large fat 
mass loss over 1 year, which made it possible to analyze 
any accompanying changes in hormonal response 
during maintained fat loss uninfluenced by fat regain. 
We performed meal tests in this study, which is the 
golden standard for evaluating GLP-1, PYY3-36, ghrelin, 
and GIP responses, and also provides information 
about glucagon secretion. We used well-documented 
assay methods with high specificity and sensitivity for 
analyzing the plasma samples (39, 40, 41). Many studies 
of hormone secretion have been carried out with various 
commercially available kits, although the specificity 
and sensitivity of these kits for hormonal analysis may 
vary considerably (55). For instance, measurements 
of peripheral circulating levels of the intact GLP-1 
molecular form, GLP-1-(7–36)NH2/GLP-1-(7–37), only 
reflect the small fraction of the hormone that reaches 
its targets via the classical endocrine route after having 
exerted the predominant part of its actions via the

nervous system (56); such assays therefore are not 
suitable for measurements of GLP-1 secretion, which 
requires determination of the sum of the intact form 
and its primary, N-terminally truncated metabolites. 
Finally, we have measured total ghrelin that comprises 
both the acylated and the deacylated forms and thus 
represents total ghrelin secretion (57, 58).
Conclusions
Collectively, we show that after 1 year of weight loss 
maintenance, meal responses of the appetite-inhibiting 
hormones GLP-1 and PYY3-36 remain significantly 
increased, whereas levels of the orexigenic hormone 
ghrelin and the lipid-regulatory hormone GIP tend to 
revert toward before-weight loss values, indicating that 
an increase in appetite-inhibiting mechanisms and a 
partly decrease in appetite-stimulating mechanisms 
appear to contribute to successful long-term weight loss 
maintenance.
