BACKGROUND: Discrimination in health care settings is
associated with poor health outcomes and may be espe-
cially harmful to individuals with chronic conditions, who
need ongoing clinical care. Although efforts to reduce dis-
crimination are growing, little is known about national
trends in discrimination in health care settings.
METHODS: For Black, White, and Hispanic respondents
with chronic disease in the 2008–2014 Health and Retire-
ment Study (N = 13,897 individuals and 21,078 reports),
we evaluated trends in patient-reported discrimination,
defined based on frequency of receiving poorer service or
treatment than other people from doctors or hospitals
(Bnever^ vs. all other). Respondents also reported the per-
ceived reason for the discrimination. In addition, we eval-
uated whether wealth predicted lower prevalence of dis-
crimination for Blacks or Whites. We used generalized
estimating equation models to account for dependency
of repeated measures on individuals and wave-specific
weights to represent the US non-institutionalized popula-
tion aged 54+ .
RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of experiencing dis-
crimination in health care among Blacks with a major
chronic condition was 27% (95% CI: 23, 30) in 2008 and
declined to 20% (95% CI: 17, 22) in 2014. Reports of
receiving poorer service or treatment were stable for
Whites (17%, 95% CI: 16, 19 in 2014). The Black–White
difference in reporting any health care discrimination de-
clined from 8.2% (95% CI: 4.5, 12.0) in 2008 to 2.5% (95%
CI: −1.1, 6.0) in 2014. There was no clear trend for His-
panics. Blacks reported race and Whites reported age as
the most common reason for discrimination.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest national declines in
patient-reported discrimination in health care among
Blacks with chronic conditions from 2008 to 2014, al-
though reports of discrimination remain common for all
racial/ethnic groups. Our results highlight the critical
importance of monitoring trends in reports of discrimina-
tion in health care to advance equity in health care.

INTRODUCTION
Multiple forms of discrimination, or unfair treatment, have
been linked to health. Encounters with discrimination, defined
as differential treatment stemming from negative attitudes,
beliefs, and judgments about members of a socially defined
group1–3 are an established correlate of negative mental and
physical health outcomes,1, 4–6 including a variety of chronic
conditions such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer.7,
8 Discrimination may be especially impactful in health care
settings. For patients with major chronic conditions, discrim-
inatory experiences may reduce engagement with the medical
care system. Therefore, an understanding of the proportion of
patients reporting experiences of discrimination in health care
and the routine monitoring of trends is important for providing
informed health care.
It is well accepted that the interaction and ongoing relation-
ship between patients and providers can support or hinder
health promotion and chronic disease management. Provider
bias and other elements of the doctor–patient relationship have
been associated with patient satisfaction, utilization of health
care services, and patient outcomes.9–11 A 2003 Institute of
Medicine (IOM) report reviewed hundreds of studies and
concluded that provider bias, prejudice, and stereotyping of
patients may contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in
health care.12
Studies indicate that these perceptions and beliefs may, in
turn, affect physicians’ behaviors and health care decision-
making.13, 14 For example, internal medicine and emergency
department residents were presented with a vignette of a
patient with chest pain, where the patient’s race was randomly
assigned as Black or White. The residents also completed the
Implicit Association Test (IAT) to measure implicit race pref-
erence and perceptions of cooperativeness. As implicit anti-
Black bias increased, recommendations for thrombolysis for
Black patients decreased.15

health and health care disparities and discrimination within

 health care settings, including the Healthy People 2010 pro-
motion,16 may have helped to reduce the frequency of dis-
crimination in health care settings. In response to the 2003
IOM report documenting health care disparities, medical
schools have developed new curricula with the goal of elim-
inating physician contribution to inequality in health care.17
Starting in 2015, the Medical College Admissions Test
(MCAT) included new sections focused on social determi-
nants of health.18 Efforts are also being made to revise medical
curricula to incorporate training in cultural humility19 and
structural competency.20 However, little is known about the
effectiveness of changes in medical school training or other
national efforts in reducing discrimination in the health care
setting.
Although discrimination in health care has been established
as common and detrimental for patient health, there is no
national surveillance system to describe the frequency or
trends in the prevalence of health care discrimination among
patients with chronic diseases in the United States. Chronic
disease management requires ongoing encounters with various
facets of the health care system. Further, those with chronic
diseases are particularly vulnerable given their increased need
for timely ongoing care, where both differential treatment and
decreased patient engagement due to provider mistrust may
lead to adverse health events. This paper provides national
estimates of changes over time in patient-reported discrimina-
tion in health care in representative samples of older Ameri-
cans with chronic disease. A critical aspect of measuring
health care quality is patient-reported experiences.21 Examin-
ing trends and the current state of patient-reported discrimina-
tion in health care will aid in quantifying the pervasiveness of
these experiences among US populations and in setting targets
for intervention.
Prior evidence suggests that reports of discrimination vary
by race, and that race and socioeconomic status (SES) may
interact in shaping reports of discrimination. For example,
Blacks are more likely than Whites to report racial discrimi-
nation.22–24 Further, Blacks reporting racial discrimination are
more likely to report higher levels of educational attainment
and income than those reporting no discrimination.25 Among
Whites, the inverse pattern holds: Whites with less education
and income are more likely to report racial discrimination.25
These findings suggest the need for race-specific data on
discrimination and testing for interactions between race and
SES. To address these gaps, we present race-specific trends in
the reporting of health care discrimination. We also test for
interactions between race/ethnicity and wealth in examining
predictors of reports of health care discrimination.
Understanding the attributed reason for the discrimination
may also provide more specificity and inform efforts to reduce
discrimination within the health care system. In this paper, we
use nationally representative data on US adults aged 54+ with
major chronic conditions to evaluate trends in reports of
discrimination in health care, including attribution of discrim-
ination by race/ethnicity.
METHODS
Sample
We use data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a
nationally representative study of US adults aged 54+, to
examine patient-reported discrimination in health care over
time among those reporting a history of chronic disease.
Participants were identified as having a chronic condition if
they reported that their doctor had ever informed them that
they had hypertension, diabetes, cancer, lung disease, heart
condition, or stroke. HRS was initiated in 1992, but to main-
tain representativeness, new cohorts of individuals who have
aged into HRS eligibility are added every 6 years; such a
cohort was enrolled in 2010. The current analyses use data
from 2008 to 2014 (years when questions on discrimination in
health care were included in the survey). Questions on dis-
crimination were fielded in each biennial wave to a rotating,
random sample of 50% of HRS participants who completed
the in-person interview during that wave. Data were collected
from the other half of the core participants in alternate waves.
Thus, every 4 years, we have repeated measurements on
patient-reported discrimination for the same half sample
(N = 13,897 individuals with information on health care dis-
crimination, for a total of 21,078 reports). This study was
approved by the University of California, San Francisco,
Institutional Review Board.
Health Care Discrimination. In HRS, discrimination is
assessed using the Everyday Discrimination Scale (short
version) to determine chronicity of discrimination in six
different social situations.26 For this analysis, we examined
responses to the item regarding how frequently, in their day-to-
day lives, respondents received poorer service or treatment
than other people from doctors or hospitals. Response options
included Balmost every day,^ Bat least once a week,^ Ba few
times a month,^ Ba few times a year,^ Bless than once a year,^
and Bnever.^ Discrimination in health care was coded as a
dichotomous variable as those reporting any frequency of
discrimination in health care compared to those reporting
Bnever.^ As an alternative categorization, we also compared
the prevalence of reporting discrimination Ba few times a
year^ or more (coded as 1) to those reporting discrimination
Bless than once a year^ or Bnever^ (coded as 0) to examine
trends in higher frequency of reported health care
discrimination.
Participants who reported any frequency of discrimination
were asked a follow-up question about the potential reasons
for the discrimination. Response options were collapsed and
categorized as (1) race/ancestry/national origin, (2) gender, (3)
age, (4) religion, (5) weight/physical appearance, (6) physical
disability, (7) sexual orientation, (8) financial status, or (9)
other, with participants marking all that applied. Attribution
patterns were very similar throughout the period 2008–2014.
For simplicity, we present attribution results for 2008 in the
main text and 2010–2014 results in the online supplementary
materials.

 Covariates. We examined the following sociodemographic
variables as predictors of health care discrimination: age,
gender, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic vs.
non-Hispanic White [reference]; note that non-Hispanic
Whites and non-Hispanic Blacks are hereafter referred to as
BWhites^ and BBlacks,^ respectively), educational attainment
(continuous years of schooling), log-household size-adjusted
wealth (with negative wealth recoded as 0 and log values
centered at 10.13, or approximately $25,000), current employ-
ment status (yes/no), marital status (married/partnered vs. not
married/partnered), and indicators for year of interview. Ap-
proximately 90% of the analytic sample had health insurance.
Health insurance status was excluded based on a priori deci-
sions. However, it was included as a covariate in sensitivity
analyses (eTable 1 in the supplement). The results remained
very similar and conclusions did not change with adjustment
for insurance status. As time-varying covariates, marital status,
employment status, and wealth were updated with each wave
of data; however, because data on these covariates were not
yet available for 2014, we carried forward the previous wave’s
(2012) covariate data.
Statistical Analyses. We estimated the national prevalence of
patient-reported discrimination in health care in 2008, 2010,
2012, and 2014, applying the HRS wave-specific sampling
weights to represent the US non-institutionalized population
aged 54+. We tested for race/ethnicity-specific linear trends in
reports of discrimination in health care by fitting generalized
estimating equation (GEE) models with a continuous linear
term for year, specifying an exchangeable working correlation
structure to take account of the fact that some individuals
contributed to two waves of data.
To examine associations between sociodemographic char-
acteristics and reports of health care discrimination, we built
three nested GEE models, adjusting for additional covariates
in each model. In model 1, we adjusted for age, gender,
race/ethnicity, and indicators for year of interview. In model
2, we additionally adjusted for years of schooling and time-
varying confounders: log-household size-adjusted wealth, cur-
rent employment (yes/no), and marital status (married/
partnered yes/no). In model 3, we tested for the presence of
interaction between race/ethnicity and wealth. As sensitivity
analyses, we examined interactions between race/ethnicity and
education (eTable 2 in the supplement).
RESULTS
The mean age of respondents across waves was 69 years
(Table 1). Almost half were male (45–46%), and the majority
were White (79–82%). Reports of discrimination in health
care were common among Blacks in all years, but showed
an overall decline between 2008 and 2014 (Fig. 1). The largest
decrease in reports of any health care discrimination among
Blacks occurred in the beginning of this period, with 27%
reporting receiving poorer service or treatment from doctors or
hospitals in 2008, declining to 21% in 2010, and more mod-
estly to 20% in 2014. Among White participants, reports of
receiving poorer service or treatment remained nearly constant
at 18% in 2008 and 17% in 2014 (Fig. 1). The Black–White
difference in report of any health care discrimination declined
from 8.2% (95% CI: 4.5, 12.0) in 2008 to 2.5% (95% CI: −1.1,
6.0) in 2014. Tests for a linear trend of reports of any discrim-
ination in health care were statistically significant for Blacks

 (p = 0.01) but not for Whites (p = 0.24) or Hispanics (p = 0.91)
(Table 2).
In 2008, attribution of discrimination varied markedly by
race and ethnicity. Among Whites, age (29%), weight or other
physical appearance characteristic (16%), gender (10%), and
financial status (10%) were the most frequently reported rea-
sons for discrimination in 2008 and were fairly constant across
years (Fig. 2). Among Blacks, race or ancestry (48%), age
(29%), and financial status (20%) were the most frequently
reported in 2008. The top reported reasons for discrimination
for Hispanics were age (27%), race or ancestry (23%), weight/
physical appearance (14%), and financial status (14%; Fig. 2).
These attribution patterns were similar for the 2010–2014
period (eFigures 1–3 in the supplement).
In model 1, adjusting for age, gender, and year indicators,
Blacks were more likely than Whites to report any discrimina-
tion in health care (OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.14, 1.48). In the fully
adjusted model (model 2), men were more likely than women to
report any heath care discrimination (OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.06,
1.30), while age (OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.97, 0.98), log-household
size-adjusted wealth (OR:0.97, 95% CI: 0.96, 0.98), current
employment (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.98), and being married
(OR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.76, 0.94) were all associated with lower
odds of reporting any health care discrimination (Table 3).
Socioeconomic status variables including education, wealth,
and employment status, which correlate with race/ethnicity,
were added in model 2; this may explain why the Black–White
estimate became non-significant in model 2. However, the
estimated effect of being Black becomes significant again once
we allow for interactions between race/ethnicity and wealth
(model 3). Results were largely similar when examining reports
of receiving poorer service or treatment a few times a year or
more (eTable 4 in the supplement).
The statistically significant Black*ln(wealth) interaction
indicates that the association between wealth and discrimina-
tion differed between Blacks and Whites (model 3; Table 3).
Figure 3 presents the predicted probabilities of reporting any
discrimination in health care using estimates from model 3,
and indicates that although the predicted probability tended to
decline with increasing wealth for Whites, it remained nearly
the same regardless of wealth for Blacks. These results suggest
that although higher wealth was associated with fewer reports
of discrimination among Whites, it had no benefit for Blacks.
A similar Black-by-wealth interaction was found for reports of
discrimination at least a few times a year (eTable 4 in the
supplement).
DISCUSSION
Patient reports of discrimination in health care were common
in all racial/ethnic groups in this nationally representative
sample of older adults with chronic disease. Findings suggest
a declining prevalence of reports of discrimination in health
care from 2008 to 2014 for Blacks, though reports of discrim-
ination in the health care setting remain frequent for Blacks
and all other racial/ethnic groups.
This paper examines patient-reported discrimination in
health care. We did not examine objective indicators of receipt
of care. Patient-reported discrimination in the health care

 setting has been associated with worse health,27 lower satis-
faction with health care,28 and lower utilization of health
services.29 Patient-reported discrimination is of intrinsic im-
portance, since internal appraisal is associated with behavioral
responses and is a critical component in predicting biological
stress responses.30–33 Provider–patient encounters are likely to
be affected by patients’ past experiences with discrimination,
regardless of objective indicators of care processes. One lim-
itation of self-reports of discrimination, however, is that indi-
viduals may appraise an event as threatening but use coping
strategies (e.g., denial, ignoring it, reinterpretation of events)
that limit their ability or inclination to report the event.34, 35
Additionally, discrimination in health care was assessed using
one item from a six-item scale assessing everyday experiences of
discrimination. Future research intended to replicate or expand
upon these findings should consider using validated scales mea-
suring health care discrimination36 to better assess reported
discrimination in this setting. The current paper employed an
individual-level analysis. Multi-level studies evaluating regional
or hospital-level variation in reported discrimination may be
valuable as well. New cohorts were also added every 6 years,
with a new cohort added in 2010. Although we used restrictions
in each case to maintain the same age range and applied
weighting to achieve a nationally representative sample for
people of that age group, it is nonetheless possible that some
observed fluctuations in the reports of discrimination were due to
the addition of a new cohort. This may be one explanation for
the larger drop in reports of discrimination among Blacks from
2008 to 2010 and slower declines in 2010–2014, although we
saw no such change for Whites or Hispanics. The restriction to
participants who were informed by their doctor that they had
hypertension, diabetes, cancer, lung disease, heart conditions, or
stroke may have excluded participants who had these chronic
conditions but were unaware of their status due to low health
care utilization. The current analyses also did not account for
selective mortality, because we wished to describe trends only
among living patients.
To our knowledge, there is no previous literature on national
trends in reports of discrimination in health care among adult
patients with chronic conditions, who may have more

 continuous interactions with the health care system. Previous
studies have tended to examine discrimination in localized
settings using select patient samples.23, 37–39 A prior study
utilizing data from HRS examined discrimination in the health
care setting in 2008 only.40 Our finding that reports of discrim-
ination are common, especially for Blacks, is consistent with
prior literature.22–24 These results, along with previous findings,
highlight the pervasiveness of patient-reported discrimination
in the health care setting. Patients with chronic conditions rather
than acute medical issues require more routine follow-up care,
potentially exacerbating health effects associated with patient–
provider interactions, where providers may refer to the health
care provider or interactions that occur within the health care
setting more generally. The focus on patients with major chron-
ic conditions—conditions for which there are effective and
appropriate medical management strategies—makes the preva-
lence of discrimination in health care particularly meaningful.
Our finding that wealth was inversely associated with re-
ports of discrimination in health care among White patients
but not Black patients is consistent with prior literature. In
previous studies, higher education and income have been
positively associated with reports of racial discrimination
among African Americans, but for Whites the opposite is
true.24, 25 Studies show that lower-SES groups are more likely
to minimize attributions to discrimination, engage in self-
blame, and use more passive coping strategies (e.g., denial,
suppression) relative to their higher SES counterparts.34, 41–43
We aimed to establish a baseline examination of discrimi-
nation in the health care setting for older US adults with
chronic disease. Providers should be aware that a large fraction
of patients will have experienced some form of discrimination
in a health care setting, which may impact satisfaction with
and utilization of care and patient–provider relationships more
broadly. Given the various ways in which discrimination and
bias may operate, providers and other staff within health care
settings should consider how bias may impact the receipt of
care. The current study indicates that reports of discrimination
in the health care setting remain common. Continual monitor-
ing of trends is important in order to track changes in reports of
discrimination and to determine whether reported discrimina-
tion among Blacks continues to decline. Additionally, simply
recognizing how common these experiences are for patients
may help clinicians provide more appropriate, patient-
centered care. Ongoing efforts are needed to eliminate dis-
