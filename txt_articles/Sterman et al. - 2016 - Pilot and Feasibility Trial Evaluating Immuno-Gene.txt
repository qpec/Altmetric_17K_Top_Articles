Abstract
Purpose: "In situ vaccination" using immunogene therapy has
the ability to induce polyclonal antitumor responses directed by
the patient's immune system.
Experimental Design: Patients with unresectable malignant
pleural mesothelioma (MPM) received two intrapleural doses of a
replication-defective adenoviral vector containing the human
IFNa2b gene (Ad.IFN) concomitant with a 14-day course of
celecoxib followed by chemotherapy. Primary outcomes were
safety, toxicity, and objective response rate; secondary outcomes
included progression-free and overall survival. Biocorrelates on
blood and tumor were measured.
Results: Forty subjects were treated: 18 received first-line peme-
trexed-based chemotherapy, 22 received second-line chemother-
apy with pemetrexed (n ¼ 7) or gemcitabine (n ¼ 15). Treatment
was generally well tolerated. The overall response rate was 25%,
and the disease control rate was 88%. Median overall survival
(MOS) for all patients with epithelial histology was 21 months
versus 7 months for patients with nonepithelial histology. MOS in
the first-line cohort was 12.5 months, whereas MOS for the
second-line cohort was 21.5 months, with 32% of patients alive
at 2 years. No biologic parameters were found to correlate with
response, including numbers of activated blood T cells or NK cells,
regulatory T cells in blood, peak levels of IFNa in blood or pleural
fluid, induction of antitumor antibodies, nor an immune-gene
signature in pretreatment biopsies.
Conclusions: The combination of intrapleural Ad.IFN, cel-
ecoxib, and chemotherapy proved safe in patients with MPM.
OS rate was significantly higher than historical controls in
the second-line group. Results of this study support proceed-
ing with a multicenter randomized clinical trial of chemo-
immunogene therapy versus standard chemotherapy alone.

Introduction
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rapidly progres-
sive thoracic neoplasm with high mortality that typically responds
poorly to standard medical regimens (1). The current front-line
standard-of-care chemotherapy regimen is pemetrexed and cis-
platin (or carboplatin), resulting in a median overall survival
(MOS) of 12 to 13 months (Supplementary Table S1). Patients
with progressive disease may be offered additional agents, includ-
ing drugs such as gemcitabine or vinorelbine, but second-line
treatments for MPM have not demonstrated significant response

 rates or improvements in survival and have not been approved by
the FDA for this indication (1, 2). For patients with MPM receiving
second-line chemotherapy, the MOS is approximately 9 months
(Supplementary Table S1).
Giventhesesuboptimalresults,ourgrouphasexploredtheuseof
in situ immunogene therapy to treat MPM using first-generation,
replication-deficientadenoviruses (Ad)administered intrapleurally
(3). Our recent work focused on Ad vectors encoding type I IFN
genes (initially IFNb, then subsequently IFNa; refs. 4–6). Although
type I IFNs have been used with some success in certain tumors (7),
and intrapleural IFNg showed some efficacy in early-stage meso-
thelioma (8), the high doses required and associated systemic side
effects have limited the utility of this approach, a problem poten-
tially overcome by localized delivery of cytokine genes.
After intrapleural injection, Ad.IFN efficiently transfects both
benign mesothelial and malignant mesothelioma cells, resulting
in the production of large concentrations of IFN within the pleural
space and tumor (4–6). Mesothelioma cell transduction with Ad.
IFN results in tumor cell death and a powerful stimulus to the
immune system, as type I IFNs augment tumor neoantigen
presentation/processing in dendritic cells (DC), induce TH1
polarization, and augment cytotoxic CD8þ T-cell function, as
well as that of natural killer (NK) cells, and M1 phenotype
macrophages (7, 9). The inflammatory response to the Ad viral
vector itself also elicits additional "danger signals," further poten-
tiating antitumor immune responses (10). This multipronged
approach alters the tumor microenvironment, kills tumor cells,
and stimulates the innate and adaptive immune systems.
We previously showed safety, feasibility, and induction of
antitumor humoral and cellular immune responses in phase I
intrapleural Ad.IFN trials (4–6). We also identified an MTD and
demonstrated that two doses of Ad.IFNa2b administered with a
dose interval of 3 days resulted in augmented gene transfer without
enhanced toxicity. In some patients, this approach appeared to
"break tolerance," engendering a long-lasting response (presum-
ably immunologic) characterized by tumor regression at distant
sites over months without further therapy. A trial using the same
Ad.IFNa2b vector via intravesical instillation in bladder cancer
patients has also demonstrated promising results (11).
Although encouraging, the percentage and degree of tumor
responses in our phase 1 studies were limited. We attempted to
enhance the efficacy of adenoviral immunogene therapy in pre-
clinical models by adding COX-2 inhibition (mitigating the
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by decreasing
PGE2 and IL10 production; ref. 12) and by concomitant/adjuvant
administration of chemotherapy (13). This latter approach fits
well with the emerging consensus that immune stimulation by
certain forms of chemotherapy, by exposure of tumor neoantigens
to DCs and depletion of regulatory T cells (Treg), among other
mechanisms, is crucial to therapeutic efficacy (14–17). Accord-
ingly, we designed a pilot and feasibility study in patients with
MPM who were not candidates for surgical resection to assess the
safety and activity of two doses of intrapleural Ad.hIFNa2b (given
in combination with high-dose celecoxib), followed by standard
first-line or second-line chemotherapy.
Materials and Methods
Study design and patients
In this single-center, open-label, nonrandomized pilot and
feasibility trial, there were two primary outcome measures: (i)
safety and toxicity and (ii) tumor response (by modified RECIST).
Secondary outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS),
OS, and biocorrelates of clinical response and multiple immu-
nologic parameters.
The vector used in this trial, originally called SCH 721015
(Ad.hIFNa2b), is a clinical grade, serotype 5, E1/partial E3-delet-
ed replication-incompetent adenovirus with insertion of the
human IFNa2b gene in the E1 region of the adenoviral genome
(6). It was provided by the Schering-Plough Research Institute
(Kenilworth, NJ).
Eligibility stipulated: (i) pathologically confirmed MPM; (ii)
ECOG performance status of 0 or 1; and (iii) accessible pleural
space for vector instillation. Exclusion criteria included pericardial
effusion, inadequate pulmonary function [FEV1 < 1 L or <40% of
predicted value (postpleural drainage)], significant cardiac, hepat-
ic, or renal disease, or high neutralizing anti-Ad antibody (Nabs)
titers (>1:2,000).
The stopping criteria and detailed description of adverse events
that served as dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) are described in the
Supplementary Methods. In brief, DLTs were defined (using NIC
criteria) by any grade 4 toxicity, grade 3 hypotension or allergic
reaction, grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity persisting for more
than 7 days, persistent cytokine release syndrome, or grade 3
hematologic toxicity persisting for >7 days.
The protocol was approved by the Penn Institutional Review
Board (IRB; UPCC 02510), the FDA (BB-IND 13854), and
the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee. Written
informed consent was obtained from patients at the time of
screening, and the study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov
(NCT01119664).
Study design
Eligible patients with MPM underwent tunneled intrapleural
catheter insertion under local anesthesia or via thoracoscopy (6).
On study days 1 and 4, a dose of 3 � 1011 viral particles Ad.
hIFNa2b, diluted in 25 to 50 cc of sterile normal saline, was
instilled into the pleural space. Patients were observed in the
Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC) of the
Translational Relevance
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rapidly pro-
gressive thoracic neoplasm with high mortality that typically
responds poorly to standard medical regimens. The recent
success of cancer immunotherapy makes it important to
explore this novel strategy in mesothelioma. This trial
describes an approach called "in situ immunogene therapy"
in which a nonreplicating adenoviral vector (Ad) expressing
the immune-activating cytokine IFNa was injected intrapleu-
rally into mesothelioma patients, followed by first- or second-
line chemotherapy. Ad.IFN transfects both benign mesothelial
and malignant mesothelioma cells, resulting in viral "danger
signals" and the production of large concentrations of IFN
within the pleural space, providing a powerful stimulus to the
immune system. This study demonstrates that this approach
was safe, feasible, and well tolerated in patients with MPM.
Overall survival rate was significantly higher than historical
controls in the second-line group. These results support val-
idation with a larger, multicenter randomized clinical trial.

 University of Pennsylvania Medical Center (Philadelphia, PA) for
at least 24 hours after vector instillation. The vector was admin-
istered concomitant with a 14-day course of oral celecoxib (400
mg twice daily starting 3 days prior to vector instillation).
Fourteen days after the first dose of vector, patients initiated
outpatient chemotherapy in one of two treatment groups: treat-
ment-na€
�ve patients received standard-dose front-line chemother-
apy with pemetrexed and a platinum agent (either cisplatin or
carboplatin). Those undergoing second-line chemotherapy pri-
marily received gemcitabine � carboplatin (Table 1). In addition,
the second-line cohort included patients who had undergone
pemetrexed-based chemotherapy at least 6 months previously
with disease stability or response. These subjects were retreated
with pemetrexed, as has been reported in the medical literature
(Supplementary Table S1).
Patients were monitored as outpatients through day 190 and
thereafter by telephone or electronic medical record. Patients were
assessed for antitumor responses every 6 weeks after initial treat-
ment using chest CT scans up until 6 months. If progression was
documented at the initial follow-up CT scan (approximately 2
months postvector dosing), then subjects proceeded with other
therapeutic options but continued to be followed (Supplemen-
tary Table S2). After 6 months, patients were tracked in return
visits, by communications with local physicians, and by phone
conversations. Times of death and progression were recorded;
subsequent treatments and the causes of death were determined
where possible.
Radiographic analysis was performed by a board-certified tho-
racic radiologist (S.I. Katz) blinded to the patients' medical history
and other clinical trial results. Modified RECIST measurements
were recorded at each exam (18).
Biocorrelates
ELISAs were used to measure IFNa2b levels (PBL Biomedical
Laboratories),aswellasserummesothelin–relatedprotein(SMRP)
levels (Fujirebio, Inc). Nabs were assessed as described previously
(5). To detect induced humoral responses against tumor antigens,
we performed immunoblotting against purified mesothelin and
extracts from allogeneic mesothelioma cell lines using pre- and
posttreatment serum as described previously (4–6). See Supple-
mentary Methods and Supplementary Fig. S1 for details.
Cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
were collected prior to treatment, 2 days after Ad.IFN instillation
(before the second dose) and 15 days after the first dose (just prior
to chemotherapy administration). PBMCs were studied from a set
of six patients who responded to therapy and six patients who
progressed with treatment (Supplementary Table S3). PBMCs
were thawed, and the activation of NK cell and T cells was assessed
using flow cytometry as detailed in the Supplementary Methods
(see also ref. 19).
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections from original sur-
gical biopsies or previous surgery were available from 18 patients
and stained with anti-CD8, anti-CD68, or anti-PDL1 antibodies.
Tissue sections were also assessed for RNA levels using NanoString
analysis (see Supplementary Methods for details).
Immunogene score. To evaluate the basal "immune activation"
state of the tumors, we adapted the recently described "immuno-
score" derived from studies used to predict immune responses of
melanoma and lung cancer patients to an anticancer MAGE
vaccine (20). This study identified 84 genes (mostly related to
CD8 T cells and IFN responses) that correlated with response. We
had information on 27 of the 61 PCR-validated genes in our
NanoString data (see Supplementary Table S4). The sum of the
intensity ofeach of these 27genes was determined and each tumor
ranked from highest expression to lowest expression.
Statistical analysis
Our original Penn IRB approval was for enrollment of 10 to 15
patients in each of the two cohorts: first- and second-line chemo-
therapy. With a minimum of 11 patients in a treatment stratum,
we had 90% power to identify any unanticipated toxicity with
prevalence of �19%; we were ultimately provided with enough
vector to treat 40 patients, so we subsequently received IRB
approval for a study amendment allowing for a total number of
40 patients, allowing us to treat 18 first-line and 22 second-line
patients. This provided us with 90% power to identify any
unanticipated toxicity with prevalence of approximately 12%.
Efficacy was determined by estimating objective response rates
and distributions of times to progression and death. We summa-
rized the distributions of PFS and OS by Kaplan–Meier curves,
comparing curves across strata by the log-rank test.
Statistics used for the flow cytometry data are described in the
Supplementary Methods.
Role of funding source
This study was sponsored by the University of Pennsylvania
(Philadelphia, PA), with funding provided by an NCI Program
Project grant (NCI P01 CA66726). The academic authors were
fully responsible for the design, conduct, and analysis of the trial.
Results
Forty patients with MPM were enrolled on the trial between
March 2011 and October 2013. Patient demographics are sum-
marized in Table 1.
Thirty-two patients received two intrapleural doses of Ad.
hIFNa2b. Eight patients received only one dose of vector because
of: (i) low serum albumin (n ¼ 1); (ii) shortness of breath (n ¼ 2);
(iii) increased serum transaminases (n ¼ 1); (iv) supraventricular
tachycardia (n ¼ 1); or (v) decreased absolute neutrophil count
(n ¼ 3). In several of the eight cases, wherein patients received a

 single dose and were ineligible for repeat dosing, the adverse
effects that precluded repeat dosing were at least in part attribut-
ableto expectedadverseeventssecondaryto theinitialvectordose.
All 40 patients were able to begin chemotherapy treatment
14 days after initial vector instillation. Eighteen of 40 patients
(45%) received first-line chemotherapy. Twenty-two patients
(55%) received second-line chemotherapy with either peme-
trexed (n ¼ 7) alone or gemcitabine � carboplatin (n ¼ 15). At
least four cycles of chemotherapy were delivered to all but 10 of
the 40 patients. Chemotherapy was stopped in nine of these
10 patients due to disease progression after one cycle [n ¼ 1
(first-line)], two cycles [n ¼ 6 (one first line, five second-line)], or
three cycles [n ¼ 2 (both second-line)]. In the 10th patient,
chemotherapy was stopped after one cycle due to development
of an acute respiratory decompensation subsequently determined
to be unrelated to the protocol.
The study protocol was generally well tolerated. Most patients
experienced only expected mild toxicities from the vector and
transgene expression, including cytokine release syndrome, nau-
sea, fatigue, anemia, lymphopenia (grade 3–4), and hypoalbu-
minemia (Table 2). These toxicities typically resolved within 24 to
48 hours of completion of vector dosing and predominantly
occurred after the initial vector infusion. We identified 11 patients
who had mild symptoms, including temporary malaise, loss of
appetite, nausea, and persistent low-grade fevers, for a few days
after vector instillation, presumably due to systemic IFN effects.
Serious adverse events included pleural catheter infection (n ¼ 2);
hypoxia (n ¼ 2); supraventricular tachycardia (n ¼ 1); and
esophagitis (n ¼ 1); none was directly attributable to the instil-
lation of the vector (Table 2). Local infection related to catheter
placement was certainly associated with the study protocol, in
which the majority of patients underwent catheter insertion
specifically for enrollment in this clinical trial, but adverse effects
from the catheter were not directly related to the administration of
rAdIFN into the pleural space via the catheter or to the rAdIFN
vector itself. The one patient with transitory hypoxia experienced a
presumed congestive heart failure exacerbation on the day of
repeat vector dosing related to planned withholding of diuretics in
anticipation of possible hypotension related to vector instillation.
The hypoxia rapidly resolved after diuresis. The episode of sup-
raventricular tachycardia was seen a single patient with massive
tumor burden in the right hemithorax and mediastinum com-
pressing both his left and right atria. The esophagitis was noted in
a patient who required stereotactic radiotherapy for palliation of a
focal region of her left-sided malignant pleural mesothelioma that
was compressing her distal esophagus.
There were no treatment-related deaths. Adverse events during
the chemotherapy portion of the study were expected and com-
parable with historical controls (Table 3).
Response rates using modified RECIST1.1 are shown in Fig. 1A
and Table 4. For both cohorts combined, we noted stable disease
in 62.5% of patients and partial responses in 25% of patients; no
complete responses were observed. Only 12.5% had progressive
disease following cycle 2. The overall disease control rate (DCR)
was 87.5%. Partial responses were seen in 9 of 25 (36%) evaluable
patients with pemetrexed-based chemotherapy and 1 of 15 (7%)
with gemcitabine-based treatment.
Figure 1B and C show the changes in modified RECIST
measurements and SMRP levels, respectively, compared with
baseline. For SMRP, 12 of the 27 patients showed more than a
20% increase in SMRP level (Fig 1C, top), whereas 15 of the 27
patients showed a greater than 20% decrease at some time
point (Fig. 1C, bottom). Both modified RECIST and SMRP
responses were durable.
At the time of submission of this manuscript, 6 of 40 patients
remained alive with a minimum follow-up of 24 months. All but
two of the deceased patients died from progressive disease, with
one patient dying from esophageal perforation status post proton-
beam radiotherapy (5 months) and another from a BAP-1
deficiency–related metastatic uveal melanoma (40 months).
Figure 2A shows the Kaplan–Meier curve of the entire group. The
MOS was 13 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 9–12];
however, we noted a significant "tail" to the curve, revealing a
subset of patients with prolonged survival. The survival of the
entire cohort at 12 months was 55% (95% CI, 0.38–0.69), at 18
months 40% (95% CI, 0.55–0.25), and at 24 months 25% (95%
CI, 0.39–0.13). The PFS was 5.3 months.

 A number of subgroups were analyzed. Figure 2B shows a
significant (log rank, P ¼ 0.004) difference in MOS for the 30
patients with epithelial histology (19 months) versus the 10
patients with nonepithelial histology (6.5 months). The 18 treat-
ment-na€
�ve patients treated with front-line chemotherapy had a
MOS of 12 months (95% CI, 6–15; Fig. 2C) with a median PFS of
6.5 months (95% CI, 5.5–11.5). Figure 2D shows survival in the
22 patients treated with second-line therapy. The MOS for the
second-line cohort was 17 months (95% CI, 6.5–26). Figure 2E is
a subgroup analysis of the second-line cohort. In the second-line
pemetrexed group (n ¼ 7), the MOS was 26 months (the
24-month survival rate was 62% with 3/7 patients still alive)
with a median PFS of 8 months (95% CI, 3–¥). In the second-
line gemcitabine group (n ¼ 15), the MOS was 10 months (95%
CI, 4–21) and the median PFS 3.5 months (95% CI, 1.5–5.5).
MOS was not significantly associated with gender or age (data
not shown).
All potential patients were screened for baseline adenoviral
Nab titers. Sixteen percent of the screened patients had titers above
our predetermined cut-off value of 1:2,000 and were thus deemed
ineligible. Of the 40 patients who participated in the trial, the
median titer was 1:100; the distribution of titers is shown in
Supplementary Fig. S2.
Biocorrelates
Serum levels of IFNa were measured pre-vector infusion
(day 1). Serum IFN was undetectable or very low at baseline in
39 patients; one subject had high circulating levels before therapy
(2,100 pg/mL). Roughly, half of the patients (n ¼ 21) had
detectable levels of serum IFN (15–1,608 pg/mL) on day 2 after
vector infusion (Supplementary Fig S3A). Of these patients, the
median value was 470 pg/mL. Levels of IFNa in the pleural fluid
or the pleural lavage were measured at baseline in 38 patients. No
patients had detectable baseline intrapleural IFNa. Pleural levels
were much higher than seen in the serum after initial dosing
(Supplementary Fig. S3B). We saw no correlation of survival times
with the serum or pleural IFN levels (Supplementary Fig. S3C).
Expression of antitumor antibodies in the serum of posttreat-
ment patients was available for analysis in 39 of the 40 patients. In
11 patients, we observed no changes in the number or intensity of
antitumor immunoblot bands, in 14 there were minimal changes
in tumor bands, and in the remaining 14, there were clear
increases in antitumor bands. However, there were no significant
differences in survival or in radiographic response rates among
these groups (Supplementary Table S5).
We conducted flow cytometry from PBMC in six patients who
had good responses (average survival ¼ 23.5 months) and
compared results with six patients with poor responses (average
survival ¼ 7.2 months; Supplementary Table S3). In previous
studies, we had observed increases in the expression of the
activation marker CD69 in NK cells after Ad.IFN administration
in some patients, suggesting this could be a marker of systemic
release of IFNa resulting in activation of the NK cells. Although we
observed increases in the percent of NK cells and T cells expressing
CD69 3 days after Ad.IFNa instillation in the majority of patients,
we detected no significant correlation with clinical responses (Sup-
plementary Table S6). We observed no increases in the NK activa-

 RNA that was interrogated for 600 immune response–related
genes using NanoString technology. We had information on 27
of the 61 PCR-validated genes from a recently published
immune response gene signature (20). These markers are pri-
marily T-cell and IFN-induced genes (see Supplementary Table
S4). When the MPM specimens were ranked for intensity of
expression of these genes, there was no significant correlation
with survival (Supplementary Fig. S6).
Discussion
The rationale for this trial was to induce antitumor immune
responses using an approach called "in situ vaccination," a strategy
where the tumor site itself is used as a target and becomes the
source of antigen. We used the strong immune-potentiating activ-
ity of an adenoviral vector expressing an activating transgene
(IFNa) to both induce immunogenic cell death and change the
tumor microenvironment towards an immunostimulatory state.
In addition, we attempted to further alter the tumor microenvi-
ronment by inhibiting the potent immunosuppressive molecule
PGE2 (26) by administering a COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib. Most
cancer vaccines, however, require multiple administrations of
antigen ("boosts") for optimal efficacy (27, 28). As the induction
of neutralizing Ad antibodies prevented us from giving more than
two, closely spaced doses of vector, we provided our "boost" by
taking advantage of the observations that certain types of

 chemotherapy can cause cell death in an immunogenic context,
thus stimulating a primed antitumor response (14–17). This is,
therefore, one of the first clinical trials to formally employ a
combinationofinsitu geneticimmunotherapyandchemotherapy.
Our multipronged combination approach proved to be both
feasible and safe in the majority of patients enrolled. In our study,
32 of 40 patients tolerated the combination therapy without
evidence of serious adverse events; the majority of adverse events
related to vector dosing were attributable to the initial dose; and
seven of the eight patients who had serious adverse events after
initial dosing were able to safely complete the course of celecoxib
and chemotherapy. Only a single patient did not proceed with
further chemotherapy dosing, and this was because of the esoph-
agitis related to radiotherapy, as described previously.
On the basis of our prior clinical trials involving repeated
intrapleural dosing of recombinant Ad vectors expressing type I
IFN genes (AdIFNb and AdIFNa; refs. 4–6), the majority of the
observed toxicities were related to cytokine release syndrome
secondary to the initial vector dose. In this study, one of the
primary outcome measures was the safety of sequential therapy
with rAdIFN/celecoxib and chemotherapy. We did not believe
that there would be substantial differences between the combi-
nation of one dose of rAdIFN and chemotherapy and that of two
doses. As we had seen radiographic responses with single doses of
AdIFN in prior phase I clinical trials (4–6), it was reasonable from
both a safety and efficacy perspective to allow patients to proceed
in the study after only the initial rAdIFN dose.
In terms of clinical efficacy in first-line patients, our response
rate, median PFS, MOS, and 1-year survival were similar to those
previously reported in the literature with combination chemo-
therapy alone (See Supplementary Table S1). However, our
disease control rate was higher than reported with chemotherapy,
and there was a "tail" on the Kaplan–Meier curve, representing a
subset of patients with prolonged survival. This was observed

 despite the fact that only 11 of the 18 patients (61%) in our first-
line cohort had the more favorable epithelial histology [a pro-
portion lower than any of the reported trials (Supplementary
Table S1)]. Although the numbers are small, the MOS in the
epithelial, front-line group was 15 months versus only 8 months
in the nonepithelial patients (P < 0.05).
We believe that the lack of improvement in MOS seen in the
front-line pem/plat/rAdIFN group compared with historical con-
trols was due to several factors, including higher percentage of
nonepithelioid tumors, pretreatment with surgery and/or pallia-
tive radiotherapy, and selection of late-stage patients as early-stage
patients with mesothelioma were shunted into concurrent trials of
radical pleurectomy and photodynamic therapy at our institution.
Surgery for mesothelioma was not nearly as well established in
2003 at the time of publication of the study by Vogelzang and
colleagues, and therefore, many of the patients receiving chemo-
therapy in that trial would have been considered for surgical
intervention at the present time.
Although the response rate and median PFS in second-line
patients were similar to those from previously reported trials, the
DCR and MOS were almost double those reported in similar
second-line chemotherapy trials (Supplementary Table S1). Sim-
ilar to the front-line patients, we found a "survival tail" on the
Kaplan–Meier plots. Approximately 20% of second-line patients
receiving gemcitabine-based chemotherapy were alive at 24
months, suggesting a prolonged immunologic phenomenon. Of
special interest, however, was the finding that the seven second-
line patients undergoing retreatment with pemetrexed had an
especially impressive DCR of 100%, response rate of 28%, a PFS
of 8 months, and an MOS of greater than 25 months. For a
comparison with this specific patient population, we were able
to find data from three clinical trials (which included a total of 103
patients) that administered pemetrexed as second-line therapy in
patients who had previously responded to pemetrexed (Supple-
mentary Table S1). Although this group clearly has especially
good response characteristics (with average reported response
rates of 18%, PFS of 5.1 months, and MOS of 11.7 months), the
patients in this trial responded to a much more impressive degree
(see above).
The presence of patients with durable stable or slowly progres-
sive disease resulting in prolonged survival has been observed in
other immunotherapy trials (29). For example, recent studies
using anti-CTLA antibodies have shown this pattern in melanoma
and mesothelioma (30, 31). This pattern is consistent with
observations that the effects of immunotherapy are frequently
delayed, can show mixed patterns of response, and may not result
in increased PFS or MOS while still engendering improved long-
term survival rates (29, 32). Our long-term response data using
radiographic measurements and SMRP levels, and the prolonged
"stable disease" seen in many of our patients, are similar to other
immunotherapy trials.
Despite our extensive investigations, we were unable to identify
potential biomarkers that might provide prognostic and/or mech-
anistic information. This may be due to the fact that circulating
cells or factors may poorly reflect processes within tumors, the
implication being that the most useful biomarkers will need to be
found from tumor biopsy specimens. This may be especially true
for types of immunotherapy (such as ours) that generate poly-
clonal responses against unknown antigens, compared with vac-
cines where responses against a known specific antigen can be
measured in the blood.
It is of interest to speculate on how Ad.IFN therapy might
interface with checkpoint inhibitory blockade, an approach show-
ing promise in mesothelioma (31). In contrast to checkpoint
blockade therapy with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies, the
expression of PD-L1 and the preexisting immune signature of the
tumor did not predict response to Ad.IFN. Given that in situ
vaccination presumably works by inducing immune responses
rather than simply amplifying existing endogenous immunity,
Ad.IFN may be especially useful in those patients with minimal
endogenous immune responses or low expression of PD-L1 and
might be even more efficacious when combined with anti-CTLA4
oranti-PD1 antibodies. Preclinical studies totest these hypotheses
are underway.
As our study was relatively small, nonrandomized, and con-
ducted at a single center, it is important to recognize several
potential limitations to the interpretation of the results. There is
substantial heterogeneity in the clinical course of mesothelioma.
A recently published registry study detailing the survival of
patients with MPM posited that the MPM population can be
divided into two groups: one with a short survival time (9–12
months) and another small group that survives considerably
longer (33). Any early-stage clinical trial, such as ours, is subject
to possible selection bias, including bias towards a good ECOG
performance status and a clinical status sufficient to tolerate access
to the pleural cavity for intrapleural delivery of the Ad.IFN vector.
Importantly, many of our patients received subsequent therapies
with uncertain impact on ultimate survival (see Supplementary
Table S2). In addition, with the limitations of our study design, we
cannot differentiate the individual effects of PGE2 inhibition with
celecoxib and induction of antitumor immune responses by
intrapleural delivery of rAdIFN. Although there are independent
effects of each intervention in preclinical models, we demonstrat-
ed synergy in antitumor effects with the combination of celecoxib
and adenoviral gene therapy (ref. 16 and unpublished data).
Given the rarity of malignant pleural mesothelioma, the urgent
need to rapidly test new approaches, and the challenges of
accruing patients into large, randomized clinical trials, particu-
larly into a four-armed clinical trial (chemo alone, chemo þ
rAdIFN, chemo þ celecoxib, and chemo þ rAdIFN/celecoxib),
we chose to study the rAdIFN/celecoxib combination as a "single"
experimental intervention. We have also observed in pilot studies
that celecoxib administration can mitigate some of the symptoms
of cytokine release syndrome that can be seen in some patients
receiving rAdIFN; thus, there is an additional rationale for a brief
period of celecoxib administration in future trials even in the
absence of effects upon the tumor microenvironment.
As our trial was nonrandomized, our results can only be
interpreted in the context of previously published studies with
the presumption that the smaller second-line trials had the same
sort of patient populations and similar biases as our trial. Using
this admittedly imperfect comparator, a particularly interesting
finding in our study was that patients with mesothelioma who
received second-line chemotherapy (especially second-line peme-
trexed) did extremely well when the chemotherapy was given
subsequently to a priming protocol of immunogene therapy via
Ad.IFN in situ vaccination plus targeted blockade of immunosup-
pression by concomitant administration of celecoxib. As for the
second-line pemetrexed patients, it is clear that this group fared
better in terms of MOS than the second-line gemcitabine cohort
(and, ironically, even better than first-line pemetrexed recipients).
We were likely selecting patients with more favorable tumor

 biology, given that they had a durable (at least 6-month) initial
response to pemetrexed prior to disease progression. In addition,
those patients who failed to respond to pemetrexed/platin and
then received gemcitabine likely had a worse overall tumor
biology than the treatment-na€
�ve patients in the first-line cohort.
Therefore, there were selection biases in both directions in the
second-line arm of the trial. Perhaps most importantly, these
same biases are present in every second-line chemotherapy trial in
mesothelioma, and our reported OS rates in second line are
superior to prior reports of retreatment with pemetrexed as well
as with gemcitabine (see Supplementary Table S1).
These results raise several interesting, but as yet unanswered
questions: (i) why did second-line patients respond so much
better than first-line recipients? (ii) why do patients receiving a
repeat course of pemetrexed perform better than those on the
second line gemcitabine? (iii) is it possible that the patients who
initially responded to pemetrexed and were then retreated have
been preselected as long-term stable disease? and (iv), if the
immune response is to be credited with the difference in survival,
then why are there no markers of immune responsiveness that
correlate with this outcome? A biopsy subsequent to therapy
would have been helpful in determining intratumoral markers
of immune responsiveness but was not included in this clinical
protocol. Hopefully, some of these questions can be answered in
future studies.
We do not yet know the optimal chemotherapy regimen for
"immunologic priming" in mesothelioma. The potential role of
chemotherapy in combination with immunotherapy is multifold
and includes tumor cell death resulting in presentation of tumor
neoantigens to DCs; decreased numbers of myeloid-derived sup-
pressor cells and Tregs; overall T-cell depletion allowing increased
space in the existing T-cell repertoire for tumor-specific cytotoxic T
cells; and increased T-cell trafficking into the tumor microenvi-
ronment (14–17). Our laboratory has spent considerable effort in
evaluating these characteristics of both pemetrexed and gemcita-
bine in syngeneic, immunocompetent murine models of malig-
nant mesothelioma and has demonstrated significant synergy for
both chemotherapy agents with murine versions of rAdIFN. We
selected pemetrexed for first-line therapy in this clinical trial in
large part because of its accepted role as the standard-of-care
chemotherapy agent for front-line therapy in mesothelioma;
gemcitabine is a well-accepted second-line agent for mesotheli-
oma. It is possible, however, that gemcitabine may be a more
effective agent to use in front-line therapy with rAdIFN than
pemetrexed, and we hope to answer this question in future human
clinical trials.
In conclusion, our study shows that the combination of intra-
pleural Ad.IFNa2b vector, celecoxib, and systemic chemotherapy
proved to be safe, feasible, and well tolerated in patients with
MPM. Disease control and survival rates observed in this study,
especially in the second-line therapy, compared favorably with
historical data. Obviously, the value of our approach needs to be
validated with a larger, multicenter randomized clinical trial. Such
a study is being planned in the second-line setting, where no
therapy has yet been shown to enhance survival in patients with
mesothelioma.
