ABSTRACT
Objective To summarise the literature on the 
economic burden of physical inactivity in populations, 
with emphases on appraising the methodologies and 
providing recommendations for future studies.
Design Systematic review following the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses guidelines (PROSPERO registration number 
CRD42016047705).
Data sources Electronic databases for peer-reviewed 
and grey literature were systematically searched, 
followed by reference searching and consultation with 
experts.
Eligibility criteria Studies that examined the 
economic consequences of physical inactivity in a 
population/population-based sample, with clearly stated 
methodologies and at least an abstract/summary written 
in English.
Results Of the 40 eligible studies, 27 focused on direct 
healthcare costs only, 13 also estimated indirect costs 
and one study additionally estimated household costs. 
For direct costs, 23 studies used a population attributable 
fraction (PAF) approach with estimated healthcare costs 
attributable to physical inactivity ranging from 0.3% 
to 4.6% of national healthcare expenditure; 17 studies 
used an econometric approach, which tended to yield 
higher estimates than those using a PAF approach. For 
indirect costs, 10 studies used a human capital approach, 
two used a friction cost approach and one used a value 
of a statistical life approach. Overall, estimates varied 
substantially, even within the same country, depending 
on analytical approaches, time frame and other 
methodological considerations.
Conclusion Estimating the economic burden of 
physical inactivity is an area of increasing importance 
that requires further development. There is a marked 
lack of consistency in methodological approaches 
and transparency of reporting. Future studies could 
benefit from cross-disciplinary collaborations involving 
economists and physical activity experts, taking a societal 
perspective and following best practices in conducting 
and reporting analysis, including accounting for potential 
confounding, reverse causality and comorbidity, applying 
discounting and sensitivity analysis, and reporting 
assumptions, limitations and justifications for approaches 
taken. We have adapted the Consolidated Health 
Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist as 
a guide for future estimates of the economic burden of 
physical inactivity and other risk factors.
InTRODuCTIOn
Physical inactivity is a global pandemic. Every 
year, physical inactivity causes more than 5 million 
deaths1 and costs billions of dollars to societies 
around the world.2 To date, many countries have 
developed national physical activity plans; however, 
few have been fully implemented.3 The substantial 
gap between policy and implementation may be 
due to a lack of resources, cross-sectoral partner-
ship and clear strategies. Public health responses to 
address the pandemic of physical inactivity remain 
inadequate, uncoordinated and underfunded.3
Economic analysis is essential to bridging the 
policy–implementation 
gap, 
increasing 
polit-
ical engagement and motivating actions. Around 
the world, governments are addressing many 
competing priorities with finite resources. Making 
an economic case for physical activity may help 
galvanise public support, inform decision making 
and prioritise funding allocation to develop and 
implement interventions to reduce physical inac-
tivity in the population.4 Estimating the economic 
burden of physical inactivity is a critical first step 
because it can provide comprehensive information 
regarding the burden of the pandemic and the costs 
of not taking action.2 Conducting economic evalu-
ation of interventions designed to mitigate physical 
inactivity is the key to identify strategies that are 
the best value for money to fully inform resource 
prioritisation.
It is important that studies adopt robust, stan-
dardised and transparent methods when assessing 
the economic burden of risk factors, such as phys-
ical inactivity. Methodological consistency between 
studies enables valid comparisons regarding the 
absolute and relative burden of physical inactivity 
compared with other risk factors. This can be 
expected to increase the confidence of decision 
makers to commission and use such analyses in 
decision making. To date, a range of studies have 
been published on the economic burden of physical 
inactivity at local, state or national levels, mostly in 
developed countries. In 2016, as part of the Lancet 
Physical Activity Series, we published the first global 
estimate that included 142 countries.2 However, 
prior estimates, even for the same country, vary 
substantially across studies. For example, Carlson 
et al estimated that physical inactivity accounted 
for 11.1% of the healthcare expenditure in the 
USA5 while Colditz estimated the proportion to be 
2.4%.6 The difference between 11.1% and 2.4% is 
enormous. Understanding and perhaps resolving 
such divergent estimates is crucially important to 
enhance the overall credibility of economic burden 
estimates in decision making.
The purpose of this paper is to undertake a 
systematic review of the current literature on the

Data sources and searches
The protocol for this systematic review was registered with 
the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews 
(PROSPERO; registration number CRD42016047705, avail-
able at http://www.

CRD42016047705). This systematic review follows 
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.7
We identified studies through searching electronic databases, 
including Medline (via OvidSP; 1946–present), Scopus and 
Global Health (via OvidSP; 1910–present) for peer-reviewed 
papers, and Web of Science conference proceedings (1900–
present), ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, Google 
Scholar and Google for grey literature. The literature search 
was conducted from database inception to October 2016, using 
search terms outlined in supplementary file 1. Additional arti-
cles were identified through searching the references of eligible 
articles and consultation with experts in the field (authors of 
the global estimate paper by Ding et al2 and experts listed in the 
Acknowledgements section of that paper).
Eligibility criteria
A study was considered eligible if it: (1) examined physical inac-
tivity as a risk factor; (2) examined the economic burden of 
physical inactivity in any format, such as an estimated amount, 
a percentage (eg, of healthcare expenditure) or the differential 
costs between those who were physically inactive and those who 
were not; (3) provided estimates based on a population (eg, 
Canadian adults) or a population-based sample (eg, the Austra-
lian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health); (4) provided suffi-
cient methodological details to allow for data extraction; and (5) 
included an English abstract or summary. No additional restric-
tions regarding the date of publication, language or peer-review 
status were imposed.
A study was excluded if it was based on a workplace sample 
only,8 if it provided little information on methodologies or used 
a patented technique or tool9 or if it included physical inac-
tivity as a component of an overall lifestyle index or factor.10 
Finally, publications that did not include original analysis, such 
as reviews and commentaries, were also excluded.
Study selection
Eligibility of identified studies was assessed independently by 
two authors (DD and TLK-A) following a standard protocol that 
involved reading the title, abstract and full-text articles. Uncer-
tainty was discussed after reading the full text, and any disagree-
ment was resolved by consensus. A PRISMA flow diagram 
presents the summary of the study selection process (figure 1).
Data extraction
The outcomes of the studies included direct (ie, healthcare 
expenditure) and indirect costs (eg, productivity losses). Studies 
estimating the direct healthcare costs of physical inactivity 
generally used two approaches: (1) a PAF-based approach,

which calculates healthcare costs attributable to physical inac-
tivity by applying a PAF (interpreted as the proportion of disease 
that would not exist if physical inactivity was eliminated) to 
disease-specific costs; and (2) an econometric approach, which 
uses data linking physical inactivity and healthcare expenditure 
at the individual level. Data were extracted separately for direct 
and indirect costs and for studies that used a PAF-based and an 
econometric approach.
One author (DD) extracted data from studies, and two other 
authors (TLK-A, BN) each independently re-entered 30% of 
the extracted data for quality assurance. Any disagreement was 
resolved by consensus. Extracted data elements included country, 
data sources, physical activity measures (eg, minimal risk coun-
terfactual or physical activity categories), time frame (eg, 1 
year vs lifetime) and perspective of the analysis (eg, ‘healthcare 
payer’, ‘household’, ‘economy’ or ‘societal’).11 Various other

Review
methodological considerations were extracted. Specifically, for 
studies that estimated direct healthcare costs using a PAF-based 
approach, we extracted data on the diseases or health conditions 
included in the cost estimates (eg, diabetes and stroke), whether 
the PAF was based on crude or adjusted relative risks (RRs) and 
whether comorbidity among diseases was accounted for. For 
studies using an econometric approach, we extracted data on 
the study design (eg, longitudinal and cross-sectional), sample, 
the types of costs included (eg, inpatient and outpatient) and 
adjustment for covariates. Finally, we also extracted information 
on the reported funding sources and conflict of interest.
For studies that estimated indirect costs, we extracted the 
type of costs included (eg, productivity losses from absenteeism, 
presentism and others) and the methodology used. Three main 
approaches were used. The friction cost approach (FCA) takes an 
‘employer perspective’ to estimate productivity losses during the 
‘friction period’, which is the time before an employer replaces 
the worker lost to death or disability.12 The human capital 
approach (HCA) takes an ‘employee perspective’ and estimates 
the productivity losses over an expected working lifetime, irre-
spective of whether an individual dies from the risk factor and/or 
an employer can replace the worker.13 Finally, a value of a statis-
tical life (VSL) approach monetises an average or ‘statistical’ life 
lost.14 The key difference of a VSL approach is that it seeks to 
value life lost as opposed to estimating the productivity costs 
incurred. Overall, the estimates produced differ across methods, 
increasing from FCA to HCA to VSL.
For studies that involved an estimate of the economic burden 
over time, we extracted information on whether discounting 
was applied. Discounting is a process where all present and 
future costs are converted to a single net present value (NPV). 
Discounting is an essential practice in robust economic analysis.15
Finally, we extracted information on any uncertainty anal-
ysis/sensitivity analysis regarding the estimates produced. We 
searched for whether studies investigated statistical uncertainty 
and/or structural uncertainty. Statistical uncertainty concerns 
input parameters to the model and corresponding estimates of 
the economic burden the model produced. Statistical uncertainty 
is typically represented by means and standard errors/confidence 
intervals, and statistical sensitivity analysis explores sampling 
from the distributions to understand how the economic burden 
varies. Possibilities include, for example, multiway sensitivity 
analysis and probability sensitivity analysis. Structural uncer-
tainty concerns the nature of the model (eg, uncertainty in the 
econometric assumptions used) and/or parameters included (eg, 
using FCA, HCA or VSL when estimating indirect costs). Struc-
tural sensitivity analysis explicitly investigates such uncertainties 
if relevant, by varying the model as appropriate (eg, different 
parameters and functional forms) and reporting the corre-
sponding change in the economic burden estimates produced.
In the case of lacking specific information (eg, types of cost 
included), we examined the references provided by the authors 
to obtain relevant information. If the information was not avail-
able, we coded it as ‘not specified’, and when the information 
provided was ambiguous, we coded it as ‘unclear’.
Risk of bias assessment
Due to the lack of risk of bias assessment tools or established 
methodological guidance on how to conduct a high-quality 
analysis of the economic burden of physical inactivity (or other 
lifestyle risk factor), we did not perform a formal risk of bias 
assessment according to an existing instrument, nor did we 
exclude studies based on low quality. Instead, we extensively 
discussed methodological and presentation issues throughout 
the paper and developed a checklist that could be used for future 
original studies and quality assessment.
Data synthesis
General characteristics of the selected studies, including country, 
perspective, methodology for estimating direct healthcare costs, 
whether indirect costs were estimated and type of publication, 
were summarised in a table. Additional specific information 
extracted from each study (see ‘Data extraction’) was synthe-
sised separately by the type of costs (direct vs indirect costs) and 
the methodological approaches to estimating direct healthcare 
costs (PAF-based vs econometric).
To facilitate comparison of estimates across studies, we 
presented the percentage of overall healthcare expenditure 
attributable to physical inactivity. When the percentage was 
not reported by the study but the overall physical inactivity-re-
lated healthcare expenditure was available, we calculated the 
percentage based on the overall healthcare expenditure data 
for that year from the WHO website (http:// 
apps. 
who. 
int/ 
nha/ 
database/ 
Select/ 
Indicators/ 
en). Additionally, to facilitate compar-
ison of national estimates from different years and in different 
currencies, we inflated the national estimates (point estimates 
only) in local currency units from the year of data to 2013, as 
the common year, using the annual consumer prices inflation 
indicators from the World Bank (http://

power parity (PPP) international dollars using conversion factors 
provided by the World Bank (http://

cator/ 
PA. 
NUS. 
PPP). This approach, similar to that used in our 
recent global estimates,2 allows for comparison across countries 
using a common currency taking PPP into account. Finally, when 
the authors presented incorrect information (eg, using incorrect 
exchange rate and inappropriately calculated healthcare expen-
diture percentages), we attempted to present corrected informa-
tion in summary tables and noted the correction in footnotes.
RESulTS
Selection of studies
As shown in figure 1, a total of 516 studies were identi-
fied, of which 445 were unique records. After excluding 368 
records based on reading the title and abstract, full texts of the 
remaining 77 studies were examined. A total of 46 studies were 
excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. In 
total, 40 studies were qualitatively synthesised and appraised 
(see online supplementary file 2).
Study characteristics
Table 1 demonstrates characteristics of the 40 studies. Nearly 
half of the identified studies were conducted in North America 
(10 in the US and eight in Canada), five studies were conducted 
in Australia, three in the UK, two were across multiple coun-
tries and the rest of the studies were conducted in Brazil, China, 
Czech Republic, Japan, Korea, Switzerland, New Zealand and 
Taiwan. Overall, 35 studies were peer-reviewed and five were 
grey literature reports.
Perspective
T
wo-thirds of the studies (n=27) took the sole perspective of the 
healthcare payer and estimated the direct healthcare expenditure 
only. Of the 13 studies that also estimated the indirect costs of 
physical inactivity, 12 combined the perspectives of the health-
care payer and the economy, by additionally estimating costs of

productivity losses.2 16–26 Only one study took a comprehensive 
societal perspective by estimating direct healthcare costs, indi-
rect costs of productivity losses and those of home-based and 
leisure-based production.27
Estimates of direct costs
All studies included some estimates of the direct heathcare costs 
of physical inactivity. Of those, 23 studies used a PAF-based 
approach, while 17 used an econometric approach.
Converted national estimate: we inflated the national esti-
mates in local currency units from the year of data to 2013 using 
the annual consumer prices inflation indicators from the World 
Bank

and then converted to PPP international dollars using conver-
sion factors provided by the World Bank (http://

PA. 
NUS. 
PPP). However, the estimate was not 
converted for Martin et al25 due to the lack of Swiss franc (SFr) 
to PPP international dollar conversion factor from the World 
Bank.
Studies using a PAF-based approach
As shown in table 2, although the 23 studies did not use a stan-
dardised minimal risk counterfactual for calculating the PAF, 
most used a definition that was equivalent to approximately 
 
150 min of moderate-intensity physical activity per week as 
recommended by current physical activity guidelines.28 Almost 
all studies included a broad range of healthcare expenditure, 
such as inpatient, outpatient, pharmaceutical and physician care 
costs. One study included inpatient costs only.29 In estimating 
direct healthcare costs, studies included between four and eight 
health conditions, nearly all of which included ischaemic heart 
disease, diabetes, breast cancer and colon cancer. Some studies 
included additional conditions, such as stroke, hypertension and 
 
osteoporosis.
Regarding the PAF used for estimating direct healthcare costs, 
most studies did not specify whether the PAF was based on 
adjusted or unadjusted RR. After checking the cited references 
about the PAF, we could only confirm that nine studies used PAF 
based on adjusted RR.2 18 19 21–23 26 29 30 All studies took an addi-
tive approach by summing costs attributable to physical inac-
tivity across multiple diseases/conditions. This could potentially 
lead to double counting among those with multiple conditions, 
commonly known as comorbidity. Only two studies explicitly 
described efforts to address comorbidity. One study estimated 
the potential overlaps among ischaemic heart disease, stroke, 
and type 2 diabetes and subtracted the overlapped proportions 
from the sum.2 The other study used data that could identify 
comorbidity through individual hospital records.24
All studies provided an overall amount for the healthcare costs 
of physical inactivity for a one-year time frame. Nineteen of the 
23 studies provided a national level estimate, most of which was 
presented as or converted to a percentage of national health-
care expenditure. The percentages ranged from around 0.3% in 
the Czech Republic31 and England32 to 4.6% in New Zealand,24 
with the majority of the estimates ranging between 1% and 2.5% 
(Supplementary figure 1). T
welve studies provided some sensi-
tivity analysis.2 6 18 20–25 30 33 34 Of those, four included structural 
sensitivity analysis, by taking into account different physical 
activity prevalence and/or PAF.2 25 30 34
Studies using an econometric approach
Of the 17 studies that used an econometric approach, three 
applied a longitudinal design,35–37 one used a retrospective 
cohort design,38 and the remainder were cross-sectional studies 
(table 3). The sample size of studies ranged from 250 to 51 
165. 
The measurement and categorisation of physical activity varied 
across studies and often included multiple levels. In most cases, 
healthcare cost data were measured objectively, based on health 
insurance claims or data from other healthcare systems. Only 
three studies used self-reported health expenditure data.39–41 
In most cases, health cost data included comprehensive types 
of expenditure, including both inpatient and outpatient care. 
However, two studies did not include inpatient services,42 43 
and one study primarily included inpatient services.44 The types 
of expenditure included in each study depended on the data 
sources, such as public systems versus private health insurance 
companies.
Findings from these studies were presented in heteroge-
neous formats. For example, some studies presented exces-
sive healthcare costs among those who were less active (or 
cost savings among those who were active), in terms of abso-
lute or proportional difference,5 38–40 43–45 some presented the 
magnitude of association between physical activity and health-
care expenditure42 46 47 and a number of studies extrapolated 
findings from the sample to the population at the national 
level.5 35 36 40 41 43 48 49 Overall, based on the converted nation-
al-level estimates of the proportion of healthcare expenditure 
associated with physical inactivity, studies that applied an econo-
metric approach produced much higher estimates than those 
applying a PAF-based approach (Supplementary Figure 1). Only 
two econometric studies included structural sensitivity analyses 
by taking into account alternative model forms.5 35
Estimates of indirect costs
All of the 13 studies provided estimates of productivity losses 
in the workforce (table 4). Of those, the majority of the studies 
applied HCA and estimated cumulative productivity losses over 
a working lifetime of population affected (including current 
and future costs).16–23 25 26 T
wo studies used FCA to estimate 
productivity losses during the replacement period.2 27 In studies 
where both HCA and FCA were used, in the form of sensitivity 
analysis, FCA yielded much lower costs than HCA.2 22 27 One 
study used a VSL approach and had much higher estimates of 
indirect costs than studies applying HCA and FCA.24 Although 
at least 10 studies provided lifetime estimates by incorporating 
costs that will occur in the future, only four explicitly described 
discounting future costs,18 20 24 27 another five were identified 
as applying discounting on checking their references or data 
sources.16 19 21–23 Most studies included some form of statis-
tical sensitivity analysis.2 18 20–25 27 Five studies conducted struc-
tural sensitivity analysis by varying the model using alternative 
approaches/parameters.2 22 24 25 27
DISCuSSIOn
To our knowledge, the current systematic review is the first to 
comprehensively summarise findings and methodological consid-
erations of studies estimating the economic burden of physical 
inactivity in populations. Although 40 studies were included in 
our review, the current estimates stem disproportionately from a 
small number of countries. Specifically, 38 single-country studies 
represented only 12 countries, of which 10 were high-income 
countries. At the global level, estimating the economic burden 
of physical inactivity remains an important yet underdeveloped 
area, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries.4
Based on the findings from the studies reviewed, it is evident 
that physical inactivity is a costly pandemic that is associated

Review
with a substantial disease burden in almost every country where 
estimates exist. However, because of large variation in method-
ologies, health systems and the prevalence of physical inactivity 
over time, it is problematic to compare estimates of the cost of 
physical inactivity across studies and countries. As demonstrated 
by the current review, there is important variation in the perspec-
tive taken (eg, healthcare payer only vs societal perspective), 
type of costs included, specific costing approaches, measurement 
of physical activity, adjustment for covariates/confounding, time 
frame (eg, 1 year vs lifetime) and whether sensitivity analysis 
was undertaken and in what form. These all contributed to the 
substantial variations in the estimates of economic burden.
Study perspective
The perspective refers to the viewpoint from which an economic 
analysis is conducted, which influences the types of information 
included.50 Both the original and second Panels on Cost-Effec-
tiveness in Health and Medicine recommended taking a societal 
perspective as the most comprehensive approach because it esti-
mates the total impact on society, including the health sector, 
non-health sector and households.50 51 Economic burden of 
disease studies should ideally be aligned with this guidance for 
consistency. Specifically, studies should collect information on 
costs to the healthcare sector (ie, direct costs to public/private 
healthcare providers and patient costs), non-health sectors (indi-
rect costs or productivity losses) and household economy (eg, 
impact on usual activities and carers, where appropriate). Most 
existing studies on physical inactivity take a narrower healthcare 
sector perspective with the rationale that the key decision maker 
in addressing inactivity is the health sector. While studies on 
healthcare costs are necessary, we argue that it is not sufficient, 
and it is straightforward to estimate non-health sector produc-
tivity losses and the impact on the household economy. Taking 
such wider impacts into account can help make the economic 
case for additional healthcare resources. Furthermore, policies 
and interventions that impact on physical activity may reside 
outside of the healthcare sector (eg, transportation) and may 
involve cross-sectoral partnership.
It is important to note that this approach estimates the 
‘production costs’ resulting from physical inactivity to society, 
regarding the increase in healthcare production and the reduc-
tion in economy and household production. As discussed previ-
ously, it is possible to build on this to ‘value’ the impact of 
inactivity on health, rather than only estimating cost. There are 
alternative methods to do so, such as willingness to pay and VSL; 
however, these methods can be expensive to undertake. There-
fore, in an effort to proceed incrementally and pragmatically, and 
to attempt to bring some initial alignment of future economic 
burden of disease studies, we reiterate our recommendation to 
take a societal approach concentrated on production costs and 
to disaggregate results into healthcare sector (direct costs), the 
wider economy or productivity impacts (indirect costs) and the 
household economy.

wo main approaches were used for estimating the direct health-
care costs of physical inactivity: a PAF-based approach and an 
econometric approach. Usually, an econometric approach leads 
to higher estimates. The marked differences in estimates using 
the two approaches may be explained in part by the following. 
First, a PAF-based approach focuses on capturing costs averted 
if certain diseases were prevented. Econometric models could 
additionally take into account potentially higher treatment 
intensity and costs, and possibly other ancillary costs among 
those with a disease/condition.52 Second, although the US Phys-
ical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Report28 concluded 
that there is moderate to strong evidence for the effects of phys-
ical activity on more than 20 diseases/conditions, most studies 
using a PAF-based approach included only a small subset of 
these. For example, no study reviewed included more than eight 
conditions (table 2). Therefore, using a PAF-based approach may 
underestimate the real healthcare costs associated with physical 
inactivity. Third, econometric analyses may capture differences 
in healthcare expenditure resulting from the fundamental differ-
ences between physically active and inactive individuals, such as 
overall health-seeking behaviour and health status. For example, 
according to Carlson et al’s cross-sectional analysis, adjusting for 
body mass index and excluding those with difficulty walking led 
to a 40% reduction in the estimated healthcare costs of phys-
ical inactivity.5 Fourth, while studies using a PAF-based approach 
were mainly based on overall adult populations, most studies 
using an econometric approach were based on samples of older 
participants, where physical inactivity-related diseases and condi-
tions were more likely to occur. Furthermore, in the longitudinal 
analysis by Andreyeva and Sturm, adjusting for baseline health 
led to 45% lower healthcare cost estimates.35 Although most 
econometric analyses adjusted for covariates, which should be 
standard practice, without longitudinal data and careful meth-
odological considerations, it is likely that econometric models 
could overestimate the actual healthcare costs of physical inac-
tivity because of residual confounding and reverse causality.
The choice of applying a PAF-based approach versus an econo-
metric approach depends mainly on data availability. Econo-
metric analyses require data on physical inactivity and healthcare 
expenditure linked at the individual level. Regression models 
are usually performed to estimate the excess healthcare expen-
diture among those who are physically inactive, which could 
then be extrapolated to a population. Econometric analyses 
also provide opportunities to estimate healthcare costs within 
a particular population subgroup, for example, those who were 
‘downhearted and blue’.49 However, it is important to ensure the 
generalisability of a sample before extrapolating findings to an 
entire population.
Studies using a PAF-based approach require data on healthcare 
costs for each of the diseases/conditions associated with physical 
inactivity. By applying PAF, one can estimate the proportion of 
healthcare costs attributable to physical inactivity. Several meth-
odological aspects should be considered. First, the calculation 
of PAF should be based on adjusted RR. Unfortunately, more 
than half of the studies tabulated in table 2 did not adjust for 
covariates for PAF calculation. In our previous international 
study, we conducted a sensitivity analysis by applying PAF based 
on unadjusted RR. We found that this nearly doubled the esti-
mates from the main analysis that was based on adjusted PAF.2 
Second, ideally for calculating PAF, RR and the prevalence of 
physical activity should be based on the same population using 
the same definition of physical activity. However, this is chal-
lenging because the current epidemiological evidence of physical 
activity mostly stemmed from a small number of countries using 
heterogeneous definitions and measurement of physical activity. 
Third, summing physical inactivity-related costs of each disease/
condition may result in double counting due to comorbidity. 
Current studies rarely address this issue, leaving comorbidity an 
ongoing challenge for future methodological advancement.
Although the decision for methodological approaches is prac-
tically driven by data availability, it is vital that for whatever 
approach chosen, care is taken to address the methodological

Review
issues raised above and to report all key assumptions, limitations 
and justifications for approaches taken.
Estimates of indirect costs
Only one-third of studies estimated the indirect costs in addi-
tion to direct costs. Studies varied depending on whether an 
FCA, HCA or VS approach was taken, which naturally results 
in different estimates produced. For example, according to 
the 1998 Economic Burden of Illness in Canada report, which 
applied an HCA, indirect costs of cardiovascular disease repre-
sented 171% of its direct costs.53 However, the same ratio was 
merely 3.1% according to the 2008 report,54 which applied an 
FCA.22
It is important to recognise that the existence of the FCA, 
HCA and VSL approach is not a weakness of economic analysis. 
Each approach involves different value judgements regarding 
what the analysis should consider, such as the cost of replace-
ment (to employers), lifetime (to employees) or the value of life 
itself. These are ethical and contestable concepts. We recom-
mend that a transparent economic analysis should explicitly state 
the value frame used and assumptions made and calibrate the 
analysis to the intended decision makers/end-users. As part of 
this process, we recommend structural sensitivity analyses that 
adopt different approaches, similar to the study by Cadilhac 
 
et al27 to enable readers to fully understand the impact of adopting 
different value judgements. Equally, it is important that those 
who interpret the estimates understand the differences between 
methods to avoid erroneous comparisons between studies and 
to avoid needless confusion. It is important that economists are 
part of research teams to guide the analysis undertaken and help 
communicate the methods and results.
Time frame
The economic burden of physical inactivity could occur at 
present and in the future. For example, deaths and disability 
due to illnesses could incur future costs in terms of losses of 
income and other production. Almost all studies reviewed used 
a 1-year time frame for direct costs to capture healthcare expen-
diture occurring in the year of analysis. Studies that included 
indirect costs adopt a lifetime approach by default, by valuing 
productivity losses in the present period and also in the future 
(for the FCA this is conditional on the replacement period). It is 
important that studies explicitly describe the time frame of the 
analysis and apply discounting to estimate the NPV of all current 
and future estimates. The NPV is a single estimate designed 
to create a consistent comparison across studies that may use 
different time periods.15 50 A number of studies estimated life-
time costs did not use or explicitly mention discounting. This is 
poor practice that can be easily avoided.
Sensitivity analysis
Estimating the economic burden of physical inactivity, or any 
other risk factor, involves both inevitable statistical uncer-
tainty and making various choices regarding which modelling 
approaches/methods (eg, FCA vs HCA) are included in the 
study. Therefore, it is imperative to clearly state assumptions 
for the main analysis and conduct comprehensive sensitivity 
 
analyses.11 50 51 Sensitivity analysis is an integral component of 
any robust and transparent economic analysis.55 Based on the 
current review of the literature, sensitivity analysis was not 
included in all studies. Again, this should be standard practice.
Study presentation
Most studies presented the results with sufficient information 
regarding the source of data, sampling frame (if applicable), 
measures of physical activity, type of costs, diseases/conditions 
included and year and currency. However, presentation of other 
methodological details was insufficient and often ambiguous, 
such as how the PAF was derived (eg, whether based on adjusted 
RR), perspectives, approaches, time frame, discounting and 
sensitivity analysis. Several studies presented the proportion of 
total healthcare expenditure attributable to physical inactivity, 
which is meant to facilitate comparison across studies and coun-
tries/regions. However, some studies presented such information 
in a misleading way by summing direct and indirect costs as the 
numerator, which inflated the percentage by several fold.17 18 
Future studies should clearly and accurately present key infor-
mation to improve transparency and integrity.
The need for economic evaluation of interventions to address 
physical inactivity
Estimating the economic burden is a vital first step in understanding 
the overall burden of physical inactivity and the consequences of 
inaction, which helps galvanise policy efforts. However, burden of 
disease studies should not be the sole consideration in the prior-
itisation process. For instance, large problems may be addressed 
relatively inexpensively and vice versa. Therefore, it is vital that 
economic evaluation is undertaken to assess both the costs and 
benefits of interventions to reduce the economic burden and to 
identify interventions that are the greatest value for money. In this 
way, resource-constrained decision makers can best prioritise soci-
etal resources to increase population health. There are guidelines 
that should be followed when conducting and reporting economic 
evaluations.56
Future directions
Overall, estimating the economic burden of physical inactivity 
is an area of increasing research and policy importance. We 
recommend that future cross-disciplinary collaborations involve 
economists to ensure that best practice is adopted, and phys-
ical activity experts to ensure that analyses are valid. Specifically, 
we recommend that a societal perspective is adopted to include 
direct, indirect and household costs, with the overall estimate 
reported and then disaggregated to these three levels. Further-
more, it is vital to carefully consider potential confounding, 
reverse causality and comorbidity. Discounting (when future 
impacts are included) and sensitivity analysis should be under-
taken routinely. Overall, it is vital that studies are transparent 
in reporting the objectives, rationale and intended end-users/
decision makers and that they align with assumptions made with 
the objectives. Finally, studies should transparently report any 
funding sources and conflict of interest.
There are currently no guidelines specifically for studies that 
estimate the economic burden of risk factors; therefore, we have 
summarised what we have discussed above in a new checklist 
(table 5), adapted from the Consolidated Health Economic 
Evaluation Reporting Standards.56 It is important to acknowl-
edge that it is impossible to completely standardise methodol-
ogies because economic analysis is often conducted to address 
the needs of specific stakeholders. Hence, our newly developed 
checklist should be used as a guide for improving methodolog-
ical rigour and reporting quality for future economic analysis 
that is set up to appropriately address specific objectives.
Assessing the economic burden of physical inactivity is 
important; however, there is a need for general improvement in

What are the new findings?
 
► Among the current economic burden estimates, there is 
important variation in the perspective taken, type of costs 
included, specific costing approaches, measurement of 
physical activity, adjustment for covariates/confounding, time 
frame and whether sensitivity analysis was undertaken and in 
what form. These all contributed to the substantial variations 
in the estimates of economic burden.
 
► Two main approaches were used for estimating the direct 
health care costs of physical inactivity: a population 
attributable fraction-based approach and an econometric 
approach. Usually, an econometric approach leads to higher 
estimates based on fundamental differences between the two 
approaches.
 
► Many prior studies did not follow best practice in economic 
analysis and did not present sufficient information in a 
transparent fashion.
 
► We developed a new checklist as a guide for improving 
methodological rigour and reporting quality for future 
economic burden analysis, adapted from the Consolidated 
Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist.

What is currently known?
 
► The pandemic of physical inactivity causes diseases and 
deaths and costs billions of dollars to societies around the 
world.
 
► Economic analysis is essential to bridging the policy–
implementation gap, increasing political engagement and 
motivating actions.
 
► A range of studies have been published on the economic 
burden of physical inactivity, mostly in developed countries. 
However, prior estimates, even for the same country, vary 
substantially across studies.
 
► There is no existing quality assessment tool or established 
methodological guidelines on how to conduct a high-quality 
analysis of the economic burden of physical inactivity or other 
lifestyle risk factor.
