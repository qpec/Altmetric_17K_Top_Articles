Oxidation of KCNB1 channels in the human
brain and in mouse model of Alzheimer’s
disease

Abstract
Oxidative modification of the voltage-gated K+ channel subfamily B member 1 (KCNB1, Kv2.1) is emerging as a
mechanism of neuronal vulnerability potentially capable of affecting multiple conditions associated with oxidative
stress, from normal aging to neurodegenerative disease. In this study we report that oxidation of KCNB1 channels is
exacerbated in the post mortem brains of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) donors compared to age-matched controls. In
addition, phosphorylation of Focal Adhesion kinases (FAK) and Src tyrosine kinases, two key signaling steps that follow
KCNB1 oxidation, is also strengthened in AD vs. control brains. Quadruple transgenic mice expressing a non-oxidizable
form of KCNB1 in the 3xTg-AD background (APPSWE, PS1M146V, and tauP301L), exhibit improved working memory along
with reduced brain inflammation, protein carbonylation and intraneuronal β-amyloid (Aβ) compared to 3xTg-AD mice
or mice expressing the wild type (WT) KCNB1 channel. We conclude that oxidation of KCNB1 channels is a mechanism
of neuronal vulnerability that is pervasive in the vertebrate brain.
Introduction
The imbalance between the production of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and the ability of the cells to
detoxify them, referred to as oxidative stress, is a hallmark
of aging and a number of pathologies1. One protein
known to undergo oxidation in the brain is the voltage-
gated K+ channel subfamily B member 1 (KCNB1)2. ROS
induce cross-linking of KCNB1 subunits to each other
(oligomerization) via the formation of disulfide bridges.
Once oxidized, KCNB1 channels do not conduct current
and accumulate in the plasma membrane from where they
activate an outside-in signaling pathway mediated by
integrins—with whom they form macromolecular com-
plexes—focal adhesion kinases (FAK), Src tyrosine kinases
and c-Jun N-terminal (JNK) kinases3,4. The concerted
action of these kinases stimulates the production of more
ROS and induces apoptosis. Traumatic brain injury (TBI)
has provided a good model to assess the consequences
of KCNB1 oxidation in vivo, because oxidative stress
is
extensive
in
this
condition5,6.
Transgenic
mice
overexpressing a non-oligomerizable variant of human
KCNB1 (Tg-C73A) exhibit reduced tissue damage and
improved behavioral outcome following TBI compared to
non-Tg mice or transgenic mice expressing the wild type
(WT) KCNB1 channel. Moreover, those effects can be
neutralized by Dasatinib, a Src inhibitor, which directly
impinges the downstream effectors of oxidized KCNB1
channels, the Src tyrosine kinases7. Given the significant
presence/role of oxidative stress in multiple disease states,
it is likely KCNB1 oxidation may be present in conditions
beyond TBI.
One such case is Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a dementia
characterized
by multiple
etiologies
and pathogenic
mechanisms. AD brains exhibit strong evidence of ROS-
mediated injury including abnormal levels of protein
oxidation, DNA oxidation and lipid peroxidation8. Indeed,

death through the cumulative action of multiple dama-
ging processes. It is not coincidental that KCNB1 chan-
nels undergo oxidation in the 3xTg-AD triple transgenic
mouse model of AD, where their amounts increase with
age2,9. Furthermore, non-conducting KCNB1 oligomers
cause enhanced calcium spike frequency and decreased
Fluo-4 intensity in primary 3xTg-AD neurons10. This
body of evidence underscores the potentially crucial role
of oxidation of KCNB1 channels for AD but also the need

 to elucidate the impact of this mechanism on AD
pathology.
Here, we investigate oxidation of KCNB1 channels in
the post mortem human hippocampus and in mouse
model of AD. The results of our studies indicate that
KCNB1 channels undergo extensive oxidation in the
human AD brain along with enhanced phosphorylation of
FAK and Src kinases. In the 3xTg-AD brain, KCNB1
oxidation is associated with inflammation and oxidative
stress which act in concert to increase intraneuronal
β-amyloid. These cellular injures correlate with behavioral
deficit,suggesting that oxidation of KCNB1 channels may
contribute to human AD pathology.
Results
KCNB1 undergoes oxidation in the human brain
KCNB1 forms macromolecular complexes with integ-
rins in the mouse brain4. These interactions are retained
during the formation of KCNB1 oligomers. In fact, it is
the oligomerization of KCNB1 channels that triggers
integrin signaling leading to the recruitment/activation of
Src tyrosine kinases via autophosphorylated FAK at
Tyr3974. To assess the mechanism of KCNB1 oxidation in
the human brain we obtained post mortem hippocampal
tissue of 6 AD donors (3 females and 3 males, average age
83.8 years) and 6 age-matched controls (3 females and
3 males, average age 82.5 years) from the Harvard Brain
Tissue
Resource
Center
through
the
Neurobiobank
repository of the NIH. Donors’ information including
neuropathology reports is listed in Table 1. To determine
whether KCNB1 and integrins form complexes in the
human brain, proteins were immunoprecipitated (IP) with
an antibody that detects integrin alpha chain V (integrin-
α5) and immunoblotted (IB) with an antibody that detects
KCNB1 or vice versa. Representative western blots (WB)
of co-immunoprecipitation experiments (co-IP, N = 3) in
the post mortem hippocampus of AD donors and age-
matched controls are shown in Fig. 1a. Integrin-α5 pulled
down KCNB1 channels and similarly, KCNB1 channels
pulled down integrin-α5 suggesting that KCNB1 and
integrins form stable complexes in the human hippo-
campus. A single KCNB1 subunit runs with a molecular
mass
∼110 kDa.
KCNB1
oligomers
typically
exhibit
molecular masses ∼200 kDa but they can range up to
∼400 kDa7. Notably, KCNB1 oligomers were present in
both normally aging and AD brains indicating that
KCNB1 undergoes oxidation in the human brain. To
quantify the extent of KCNB1 oxidation we calculated the
densitometric ratio between the monomeric and oligo-
meric bands (oxidation ratio) that we measured from
western blots of brain lysates stained with KCNB1 anti-
body (the oxidation ratio only depends on the relative
amounts of oligomerized and non-oligomerized protein in
the blot). This analysis underscored a significant 67%
increase in the oxidation ratio of the AD brain vs. control
(Fig. 1b). Furthermore, this increase correlated well with
the increase in oxidative stress that was assessed by
measuring protein carbonylation (64% increase in AD vs.
control, Fig. 1c). Thus, KCNB1 oxidation is a physiolo-
gical process which occurs in the normally aging human
brain and is exacerbated in AD, consistent with the ele-
vated oxidative stress associated with this condition.

from AD sample #12 and control sample #5 and total lysates were immunoblotted (IB) with Kv2.1 primary antibody. Total lysates were treated with
2% β-mercaptoethanol added in the sample buffer and thus do not show oligomers. Integrins pull down both single KCNB1 subunits (∼110 kDa) and
oligomers (∼200 to ∼400 kDa). In the lower western blots, KCNB1 and IgG IPs and total lysates were stained with integrin-α5 primary antibodies.

 FAK and Src phosphorylation are increased in the AD brain
The representative western blots in Fig. 2a show total
and phosphorylated FAK at Tyr397 and Src at Tyr416 in
the post mortem brains of an AD donor and of an age-
matched control. The fraction of activated FAK and Src
was increased by, respectively, 80% and 58% in AD vs.
control brains (Fig. 2b), in good agreement with the 67%
increase in KCNB1 oxidation/oligomerization.
KCNB1 is oxidized in mouse model of AD
To further elucidate the role of KCNB1 oxidation in AD
we studied it in the genetic background of the 3xTg-AD
mouse model of AD. This transgenic animal expresses three
dementia-related transgenes, namely APPSWE, PS1M146V,
and tauP301L and exhibits both plaque and tangle pathology,
as well as synaptic dysfunction9. We constructed 4xTg mice
by cross-breeding 3xTg-AD with transgenic mice that
expresses a non-oligomerizabe variant of KCNB1 obtained
by replacing Cys73 to Ala (Tg-C73A) or the WT channel
(Tg-WT) as control, in cortex and hippocampus which we
characterized previously7. We used 4xTg mice hetero-
zygous in either WT or C73A since homozygous Tg-WT
mice exhibit developmental delays7. Figure 3a summarizes
biochemical assessment of KCNB1 oxidation in mouse
model of AD. Consistent with results with post mortem
human brain tissue, KCNB1 oligomerization was robust in
the 3xTg-AD brain and was further increased in mice
overexpressing the WT channel. In contrast, KCNB1 oli-
gomerization was low in the brains expressing the C73A
variant as expected (we showed previously that exogenous
and endogenous KCNB1 subunits form heteromeric com-
plexes. The Cys to Ala mutation is dominant negative
and therefore the amounts of oxidized KCNB1 channels
are negligible in the Tg-C73A brain7). Furthermore,
the fractions of phosphorylated FAK kinases at Tyr397
(Fig. 3b) and Src kinases at Tyr416 (Fig. 3c) were sig-
nificantly increased in 4xTg-WT and 3xTg-AD compared
to 4xTg-C73A brains.
KCNB1 oxidation contributes to cognitive impairment in
mouse model of AD
To determine the impact of KCNB1 oxidation on the
cognitive function of the hippocampus, we assessed
1-year-old mice in the spatial working memory task in the
Morris Water Maze (MWM), which is one of the most
well-modeled aspects of the working memory deficits of
AD11. All mice behaved similarly during the acclimation
trials when the platform was visible (Fig. 4a), and there-
fore baseline adjustments were not performed. In con-
trast, during the training period (Fig. 4b) and in the
post-training assessment of memory consolidation with
the platform removed (Fig. 4c), 4xTg-C73A mice per-
formed significantly better than 3xTg-AD and 4xTg-WT.
The superior learning abilities of 4xTg-C73A mice were
already apparent at the beginning of the training. During
the first day, these mice learned to locate the platform
twice as much as fast than 4xTg-WT mice (gaining ∼14 s
per trial vs. ∼7 s per trial of the 4xTg-WT mice) even
though all mice performed similarly in the first trial,
irrespective of the genotype (Fig. 4d). Swimming speeds
were comparable in the various groups of mice (0.32 ±
0.02;
0.34 ± 0.02,
and
0.35 ± 0.02 m/s
for
3xTg-AD,
4xTg-WT, and 4xTg-C73A, respectively), suggesting that
the improved outcome in the 4xTg-C73A mice was not
due to increased activity and we also did not observe sex-
specific differences in the various genotypes12. In previous
studies we demonstrated that the only distinction between
the WT channel and the C73A variant is that the latter

 does not undergo oxidation in the brain. This leads us to
conclude that differences between the 4xTg and 3xTg
genotypes mainly depended on the oxidation of the
channel and not on other factors4,7 and thus that there is
a causal relationship between the extent of KCNB1 oxi-
dation and spatial working memory in mouse model
of AD.
Dasatinib ameliorates AD-like pathology in 3xTg-AD mice
The activation of Src tyrosine kinases is a key signaling
event following the formation of KCNB1 oligomers. In
previous studies we identified Dasatinib, a FDA-approved
specific inhibitor of Src kinases, blood–brain barrier
permeable and pharmacologically active in the brain, as a
means to neutralize the toxic effects of KCNB1 oxidation
in mouse model of TBI (the drug is also associated with
decreased KCNB1 oligomerization)7,13–23. Since in both
TBI and AD oxidation of KCNB1 channels leads to Src
activation Dasatinib should also be effective in the latter.
Two groups of 10- and 11-month-old 3xTg-AD mice
were daily injected with 25 mg/kg Dasatinib, delivered
intraperitoneally (ip), for 2 and 1 months respectively and
then tested in the MWM. The mice treated for 1 month
did not exhibit appreciable improvement compared to
vehicle mice (Fig. 4e). Mice that underwent the 2 months
treatment performed moderately better than vehicle mice
during the 6-day training period (Fig. 4f) and in the
memory consolidation test with the platform removed
(Fig. 4g). Overall, the drug was less effective in 3xTg-AD
mice than in TBI mice, where it could largely suppress the
effects of the injury7 probably because at the time of the
treatment, the AD-like pathology was already at an
advanced stage.
KCNB1 oxidation is associated to astrocytosis in the 3xTg-
AD brain
Astrocytosis is broad in AD, and glial fibrillary acidic
protein (GFAP) is a useful biomarker for the disease24–26.
We assessed the levels of GFAP in the brain by immu-
nohistochemistry (IHC, Fig. 5a) and western blot (Fig. 5b).

analysis. Similarly, the amounts of GFAP protein were
increased in post mortem AD brains compared to age-
matched controls, as expected (Fig. 5c)24,25.
Oxidation of KCNB1 contributes to inflammation and
oxidative stress in the 3xTg-AD brain
Astrocytosis generally accompanies inflammation, thus
GFAP provides indirect evidence for inflammation27,28.
We directly assessed inflammation by staining hippo-
campal sections with two antibodies (Abcam clone

 against allograft inflammatory factor 1 (Iba1). Reactive
microglia reactive for Iba1 were present in the hippo-
campus of 3xTg-AD mice (Fig. 6a, b). Reactive cells
were increased in 4xTg-WT sections and were sig-
nificantly decreased in 4xTg-C73A sections (Fig. 6c, d).
The antibodies stained accordingly to manufacturer’s
datasheets (clone ab5076: globular cells; clone 019–19741:
branched cells); however, due to the shared lineage of
microglia and macrophages, markers are common to
both cell types. Therefore we cannot rule out that
reactive cells are composed of both cell types, but
we
can
reasonably
conclude
that
inflammation
is
decreased in the 4xTg-C73A brain compared to the other
genotypes.
Oxidative stress is low in neurons expressing C73A
The pathway activated in response to KCNB1 oligo-
merization promotes oxidative stress, a hallmark of AD3,7.
Accordingly, protein carbonylation, which provides a
measure of oxidative stress, was markedly lessened in the
brains of 6-month-old 4xTg-C73A mice compared to
3xTg-AD and 4xTg-WT, where it was maximal (Fig. 6e).

compared to 4xTg-C73A mice (Fig. 7a, b). We assessed
amyloid precursor protein (APP), Aβ and Aβ(1–42) pro-
tein by Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) analysis, respectively, in the brains of
1-year-old mice. While the amounts of APP were similar
in all genotypes (Fig. 8a, b) the amounts of Aβ protein
(Fig. 8a, c), including the most neurotoxic Aβ(1–42) form
(Fig. 8d), were significantly lower in the C73A brains
compared to the 3xTg-AD and 4xTg-WT brains. Aβ
(1–42) was also moderately decreased (29% reduction) in
the brains of 3xTg-AD mice treated with Dasatinib for
2 months (3.4±0.4 and 2.4±0.1 pg/ml in the absence/
presence of Dasatinib, P < 0.043 one-tailed Student’s
t-test, N = 3 brains/group, data not shown). In addition,
the number of neurons reactive for Aβ was increased by
88% in 4xTg-WT brains between 6 and 12 months of age
but only by 46% in 4xTg-C73A brains (Fig. 7b) suggesting
that oxidation of KCNB1 exhibits an accelerating influ-
ence on the production of Aβ. Taken together, these data
underscore a mechanistic link between oxidation of
KCNB1 and the production of Aβ and further suggest that
KCNB1 oligomers impact the pathogenesis of Aβ early.
KCNB1 oxidation contributes to tauopathy
It has been proposed that Aβ may contribute to tau
hyperphosphorylation and evidence further shows that
oxidative stress is interlinked with tauopathy30–36. Since
oxidation of KCNB1 is associated to both amyloidosis and
oxidative stress, we assessed the levels of hyperpho-
sphorylated tau in the brains of 1-year-old mice by IHC,
using an antibody that detects phosphorylated tau at
Ser199 (Fig. 9a, b), and phosphorylated tau at Ser356
(Fig. 9c). The number of reactive neurons to both anti-
bodies was maximal in 4xTg-WT hippocampi and mini-
mal in 4xTg-C73A hippocampi. Tauopathy was less
advanced than amyloidosis or inflammation, consistent
with the fact that in the 3xTg-AD mouse it develops
around 1 year of age, which was the maximal age reached
by our animals9,33.
Discussion
Reactive oxygen species and K+ channels hold key roles
in both the physiology and pathology of the brain.
Evidence of oxidation of K+ channels in TBI as well as AD
is suggestive of a general mechanism of neuronal vul-
nerability
that
can
potentially
affect
all
conditions
characterized by oxidative stress, from normal aging to
neuropathies37,38. To address this fundamental question
we investigated oxidation of KCNB1 channels in AD, a
condition associated to massive oxidative stress. Our
studies reveal the presence of oxidation-induced KCNB1
oligomers in post mortem hippocampal tissue of aged
human donors and, to a significantly larger extent, of AD

 signaling events triggered by KCNB1 oxidation/oligo-
merization--are also markedly increased in the AD brains
compared
to
age-matched
controls.
The
possibility
exists that KCNB1 channels had undergone oxidation
during the preparation of the samples, for example, dur-
ing the time elapsed between the death of the donor
and the collection of the tissue. However, these technical
issues
should
have
affected
the
samples
randomly
and thus alone, cannot explain the significant differences
in the extent of KCNB1 oxidation, protein carbonylation,
FAK and Src phosphorylation and GFAP immunor-
eactivity that exist between control and AD brains. Fur-
ther, oxidized KCNB1 channels are detected in the
brains of normally aging mice and, in significantly
larger
quantities,
in
3xTg-AD
brains
where
these
technical issues are minimized2. We conclude that
oxidation of KCNB1 channels is a process that takes
place in the human brain under pathophysiological
conditions.
To gain mechanistic insight into the role of KCNB1
oxidation in AD, we engineered 3xTg-AD mice to over-
express either the C73A variant (low oxidation) or the
WT channel (high oxidation) in cortex and hippocampus.
Increased amounts of KCNB1 oligomers correlated with
increased amounts of GFAP and Iba1, two markers for
astrocytosis and inflammation, along with FAK and Src
phosphorylation and protein carbonylation. At the beha-
vioral level, 4xTg-C73A mice performed significantly
better
than
the
other
genotypes
in
the
working
memory task of the MWM. KCNB1 oxidation promotes
inflammation, oxidative stress, neuronal apoptosis, and
behavioral deficit in mouse model of traumatic brain
injury a condition that, likewise AD, is associated to
copious release of ROS7. Hence, oxidative stress con-
tributes to neurotoxicity via modification of K+ channels
irrespective of the specific pathology. We conclude that
oxidation of K+ channels is a general mechanism of
neuronal vulnerability that is conserved from worms to
humans37.
Previous studies have implicated oxidized KCNB1
channels in AD by showing that they induce hyperexcit-
ability
in
primary
3xTg-AD
hippocampal
neurons
(oxidized KCNB1 channels do not conduct current)2,10.
The work presented here adds new insight into the
molecular mechanisms underlying KCNB1′s neurotoxi-
city in AD. Thus, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress
are two well established factors that contribute to the
production of Aβ. In turn, elevated levels of Aβ can create
a positive feedback loop toward generating more oxidative
stress. Accordingly, in the 4xTg-WT brain, where KCNB1
oxidation is exacerbated, neuroinflammation and oxida-
tive stress are increased and intraneuronal Aβ is also
increased, whereas in the 4xTg-C73A brain, where
KCNB1 oxidation is diminished, intraneuronal Aβ is
decreased along with neuroinflammation and oxidative
stress. A significant reduction of the levels of intraneur-
onal Aβ can be already observed in 6 month-old
4xTg-C73A mice, an age in which plaque deposition is
still absent while oxidative stress and inflammation are
already elevated, suggesting that KCNB1 oxidation is an
early contributor to Aβ pathogenesis9,33. Aβ and oxidative
stress may also contribute to induce phosphorylation of
tau. Indeed, we observed neurons reactive to hyperpho-
sphorylated tau in all genotypes that following a well
established pattern, were more numerous in 4xTg-WT
and 3xTg-AD hippocampi compared to 4xTg-C73A.
However, the effects of KCNB1 oxidation on tauopathy
will need further scrutiny as in the 3xTg-AD mouse this
begins around 1 year of age, the maximal age reached by
the mice used in this study9,33. Overall, these results are in
agreement with previous studies. One of them in parti-
cular, from Rehamn and colleagues showed that inhibi-
tion of JNK kinases, which are one of the end-points of
Fig. 8 KCNB1 oxidation contributes to increase Aβ oligomers.

 the signaling pathway activated by oxidized KCNB1
channels results in marked reductions of Aβ production
and hyperphosphorylated tau along with inflammation,
apoptotic neurodegeneration and improved behavioral
outcomes3,39.
Dasatinib, which shows robust efficacy in mouse
model of TBI by directly impinging on the pathway
activated by KCNB1 oxidation and in the APP/PS1
mouse model of AD, had only modest effects in pre-
venting
the
AD-like
pathology
of
the
3xTg-AD
mouse7,18. It is likely that oxidation of KCNB1 occurs
during the early stages of the disease and thus treat-
ments that impinge on this mechanism need to be
started early. Accordingly, the drug exhibited increased
efficacy in younger animals subjected to longer treat-
ment. Dasatinib is blood-brain barrier permeable and is
the
first
line
drug
for
patients
with
Philadelphia
chromosome-positive Central Nervous System (CNS)
leukemia13–15,17
and
CNS
chronic
myeloid
leuke-
mia16,19,20,22,23. A factor that can limit Dasatinib’s
accumulation in the brain is P-glycoprotein (P-gp,
ABCB1), as ABCB1 knock out mice exhibit significantly
higher amounts of Dasatinib in the brain compared to
control40–43. However, P-gp function decreases in the
aging brain and is severely compromised in the AD
brain44–47. Thus, Dasatinib therapy may represent a
possible strategy for the treatment of AD.

Transgenic mice
We obtained 4xTg-AD transgenic mice heterozygous in
KCNB1 by cross-breeding 3xTg-AD mice with Tg-WT
(4xTg-WT) or Tg-C73A (4xTg-C73A) mice that we
previously characterized4,7. Briefly, Tg-WT and Tg-C73A
mice overexpress human WT or C73A KCNB1 tagged
to the human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag in the
C-terminus in cortex and hippocampus driven by the
thy1.2 cassette48. These mice have been donated to
the MMRRC repository of the NIH and are available from
them (MMRRC:43829 and MMRRC:43830). In hetero-
zygous mice, the amounts of human KCNB1 protein are
comparable in the two transgenic lines and are about half
the amounts of endogenous KCNB1 protein. Primary
hippocampal neurons express functional KCNB1 cur-
rents, whose steady-state amplitudes at +80 mV are
comparable in Tg-WT and Tg-C73A transgenic neurons
and roughly ~40% larger than in non-Tg neurons. The
Cys73 to Ala replacement in the C73A variant does not
affect channel’s functional attributes nor its ability to
cluster in the plasma membrane.
Biochemistry
The detailed biochemical procedure was previously
described4,49.
Immunoblots
Approximately 100 mg of human frozen hippocampal
tissue (a gift of the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center)
or half sagittal mouse brains of either sex were homo-
genized with a glass tissue grinder in lysis buffer [0.32 M
sucrose, 5 mM Tris-Cl pH 6.8, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM
PMSF, and protease inhibitor cocktail set I (Calbiochem,
San Diego, CA)]. Samples were centrifuged at 2000 rpm
for 10 min and the supernatant used for biochemical
analysis. Protein content was quantified with the Bradford
colorimetric assay (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and dissolved in
Laemmli buffer with or without reducing agents. Proteins
were resolved by 8–12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a
PVDF membrane that was incubated in a 5% solution of
nonfat milk in Tween 20-PBS (PBST) for 2 h at room
temperature. After overnight incubation at 4 °C with the
primary antibody, the membrane was washed for 20 min
and incubated at room temperature with the appropriate
secondary antibody.
Co-immunoprecipitations
Brain lysates were incubated at 4 °C overnight in the
presence of Kv2.1 or integrin-α5 or IgG antibodies. Then,
protein A agarose beads (30 μl of 50% bead slurry) were
added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Samples were
centrifuged for 30 s at 4 °C and the pellet was washed five
times in cell lysis buffer. The pellet was resuspended with
50 μl 2× SDS Laemmli buffer, heated at 100 °C for 10 min
and centrifuged for 1 min at 14,000 × g. The samples were
loaded on 8% SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted. The
blots were washed in PBST for 20 min and incubated for
5 min with chemiluminescence substrates and exposed.
Densitometry analysis was performed using ImageJ
(NIH) software.
Immunohistochemistry
Mice were transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline fol-
lowed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were extracted
and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose. Twenty micrometers
frozen sections were prepared throughout the cortex and
the hippocampus in a 1:20 series so that the same set of
tissue samples could be used for expression of different
makers. Slides were incubated overnight in with antibody
at 4 °C (GFAP 1:500, all other antibodies 1;100). Slides
were then incubated in the appropriate secondary anti-
body. All slides were mounted in VECTASHIELD Anti-
fade
Mounting
Medium
(Vector
Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA) and stored at 4 °C. Staining was visua-
lized on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope at ×40. Positive
were counted in coronal sections representing a 1:20 ser-
ies inclusive of the entire length of the hippocampus. CA1
and CA3 as well as the dentate gyrus was used for
quantitation of cells in the hippocampus.
Morris water maze
The detailed procedure for the MWM was previously
described7. Briefly, mice were acclimated to the paradigm
and tested for baseline response using a visible platform
test 4 days prior. The animals were placed in a circular
pool of water containing non-toxic white paint and a clear
platform for escape. To assess learning, mice were trained
using a hidden platform fixed in one of four quadrants for
6 consecutive days (4 trials/day). Black and white distal
cues were placed on the walls. The quadrant in which the
mouse
was
placed
was
pseudo-randomly
varied
throughout training and the time to locate the platform
was recorded. Maximum trial time was 60 s and the

 mouse remained or was placed on the platform for 15 sec
and warmed for 10 min between trials. To assess memory
retention, the day after the last training session the ani-
mals were be subjected to a 60 s probe trial with the
platform removed and the time spent in the target
quadrant was measured50. Data were recorded using a
video-tracking system (EthoVision XT; Noldus Informa-
tion Technology, Leesburg, VA).
Drug administration
Dasatinib (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA) was given
intraperitoneally (ip) at 25 mg/kg. Dasatinib was diluted
in vehicle solution (50 mM NaAc, pH = 5.0) from a
200 mg/ml stock in dimethyl sulfate (DMSO). Each
mouse was subjected to a daily dose of either vehicle or
Dasatinib solution via an ip injection.
Statistical analysis
Quantitative data are presented as mean ± standard
error of the mean (SEM). The level of significance,
assumed at the 95% confidence limit or greater (P < 0.05),
was
estimated
using
the
Student’s
t-test
(http://
studentsttest.com) and one-way ANOVA with a Tukey
post hoc test (http://vassarstats.net/anova1u.html).
