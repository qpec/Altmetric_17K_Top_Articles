Abstract
Background—Mutations in Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) enhance levels of 
autophosphorylated LRRK2 protein and are the most common known cause of inherited Parkinson 
disease (PD). LRRK2 has been further implicated in susceptibility to idiopathic PD in genetic 
association studies.
Objective—To compare autophosphorylated Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels from biobanked urine 
samples with clinical data in PD and controls.
Methods—Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels were measured from urine exosome fractions from 79 PD 
and 79 neurologically healthy controls enrolled into the Parkinson Disease Biomarker Program at 
the University of Alabama at Birmingham.
Results—Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels were higher in males than females (p<0.0001) and elevated 
in PD compared to controls (p=0.0014). Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels were higher in PD cases with 
worse cognition and correlated with poor performance in MoCA (r=−0.2679 [−0.4628, −0.0482]), 
MDS-UPDRS subscales 1 and 2 (r=0.2239 [0.0014, 0,4252], 0.3404 [0.1276, 0.5233] 
respectively), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (r=0.3215 [0.1066, 0.5077]), and Modified Schwab and 
England Activities of Daily Living Scales (r=−0.4455 [−0.6078, −0.2475]). Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 
levels predicted those with worse cognitive impairment in PD patients with some success (c=0.73).
Conclusions—Urinary exosome Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels are elevated in idiopathic PD and 
correlated with the severity of cognitive impairment and difficultly in accomplishing activities of 
daily living. These results implicate biochemical changes in LRRK2 in idiopathic PD.

Introduction
Genetic studies identified mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene as the 
most common known cause of autosomal-dominant PD1–5. The LRRK2 gene is also linked 
to idiopathic PD (i.e., cases without LRRK2 or other known genetic mutations) through 
genome-wide association studies6. LRRK2 protein includes two enzymatic domains proven 
to have GTPase and protein kinase activity. The kinase domain that harbors the most 
common LRRK2 mutation, G2019S, can direct intrinsic phosphorylation (i.e., 
autophosphorylation) in and nearby the GTPase domain7, 8. Pathogenic LRRK2 mutations 
including the R1441C, Y1699C, and G2019S mutation increase autophosphorylated LRRK2 
protein levels in model systems8–11. One of the most abundant sites of autophosphorylation 
is the Ser-1292 residue nearby the GTPase domain8. Treatment with LRRK2 kinase 
inhibitors diminish levels of Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 in model systems8, 12.
Our previous work demonstrated that LRRK2 protein can be purified from urinary exosomes 
in biobanked samples13. Recently we discovered that medicated PD patients with the 
G2019S-LRRK2 mutation show a ~5-fold elevation of autophosphorylated Ser(P)-1292 
LRRK2 protein in urinary exosomes compared to non-carrier controls and medicated PD 
patients without the G0219S-LRRK2 mutation11. LRRK2 autophosphorylation has not been 
previously evaluated in a larger series of idiopathic PD cases. Here, exosome Ser(P)-1292 
LRRK2 phosphorylation is measured in urine from both idiopathic PD cases and controls. 
Among PD cases, we assess the association between autophosphorylated LRRK2 levels and 
clinical motor and non-motor disease severity scales.
Methods
Study Subjects
Urine was obtained from study patients (81 diagnosed with PD [41 males] and 81 
neurologically healthy controls [40 males]) enrolled at the University of Alabama at 
Birmingham (UAB) Movement Disorder Clinic. Subjects were selected from the UAB 
cohort for this study based on frequency matching of age and gender between cases and 
controls. Inclusion criteria for cases were a diagnosis of PD based on the United Kingdom 
Parkinson’s Disease Society Brain Bank Criteria. Inclusion criteria for healthy controls were 
ages of 35–85 years, lack of PD in first-degree blood relatives, and a lack of positive 
responses on more than three items in the PD Screening Questionnaire15. Exclusion criteria 
for all patients included atypical features indicative of progressive supranuclear palsy, 
multiple system atrophy, corticobasal degeneration, cerebellar signs, supranuclear gaze 
palsy, apraxia, disabling autonomic failure, neuroleptic treatment at time of onset of 
parkinsonism, active treatment with a neuroleptic at time of study entry, history of repeated 
strokes with stepwise progression of parkinsonism, history of repeated head injury, history 
of definite encephalitis, dementia, known severe anemia, kidney disease as determined by 
Fraser et al.

 measurement of serum creatinine and/or medical records, urinary tract or bladder infection, 
or a serious comorbidity that would interfere with participation in the study. None of the 
participants carried a LRRK2 mutation (e.g., G2019S, R1441C/G, Y1699C) as determined 
with the NeuroX array following enrollment as described16. This study was approved by the 
UAB Institutional Review Board, and all subjects signed informed consents. All samples 
were processed by investigators blinded to PD status, and final curated datasets were 
achieved before associating clinical characteristics to sample values.
Clinical Evaluations
Demographics, PD characteristics, medications, medical history and family history of PD 
were collected. Levodopa equivalent daily dose was calculated as described17. Subjects were 
evaluated between 08:00 and 12:00 and PD patients were taking their usual medications. 
Motor assessment was conducted with the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s 
Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). Cognition was screened by the Montreal cognitive 
assessment (MoCA). Non-motor symptoms and performance were assessed by the Epworth 
sleepiness scale (Epworth SS), Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39), and 
modified Schwab and England v1.0 Activities of Daily Living (Mod. S&E ADL v1.0) scale. 
All assessments were conducted by a single rater (R.G.C.) throughout the duration of the 
study.
Sample Collection and Handling
Samples were collected between January 2013 and December 2014 in a cross-sectional 
study as part of the Parkinson’s Disease Biomarker Program14 (https://pdbp.ninds.nih.gov). 
Urine samples were procured during the subject visit along with blood samples. Within two 
hours of collection, urine was aliquoted into 50 mL polypropylene tubes and stored at −80 C 
for future processing and exosome isolation.
Exosome Isolation
Exosomes were isolated as previously described11. Briefly, 50 mL polypropylene tubes were 
quick-thawed at 42 C at 100 RPM in a water bath. Urine was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g 
for 30 min in Beckman JA-14 rotors and the supernatant then centrifuged at 100,000 × g in 
Beckman UltraClear tubes for 2 hours in a Beckman SW-32 Ti rotor. The resultant exosome 
pellet was washed in a saline-buffered solution, resuspended into lysis buffer, and stored at 
−80 C for further analysis. Supplementary Figure S1 includes a cryo-electron micrograph of 
these isolated urinary exosomes following saline-buffered solution wash prior to exosomes 
lysis.
Immunoblotting and Quantitation
Samples were analyzed onto TGX gels (7.5%) SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto PVDF 
membrane (Millipore Immobilon-FL PVDF). Antibodies were applied to membranes (anti-
TSG101 [Abcam poly rabbit], N241(anti-LRRK2) [Antibodies Inc], and MJFR-19 (anti-
pS1292-LRRK2) [Abcam]). Membranes probed with TSG101 and N241 were blocked using 
Odyssey blocking buffer (LiCOR) for 1 hour at room temperature and then incubated 
overnight in primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer at 4 C on a shaker (1:2500 TSG101,

 1:2000 N241, both ~1 μg mL−1 in solution). Membranes were washed 3 × 5 min in 1× tris-
buffered tween solution and then incubated overnight with secondary antibodies. LiCOR 
secondary antibodies were used at 1:20,000 dilutions and consisted of Goat-anti mouse or 
anti rabbit IRDye 800CW and IRDye 680LT.
Blots were developed using a LiCOR Odyssey Scanner. Signals were recorded with LiCOR 
Image Studio. An exosomal pellet and a corresponding exosome protein marker (TSG101 
protein) were detected in all specimens with the exception of two control subjects and two 
PD subjects where no protein could be measured for any of the markers. These four subjects 
were excluded from the study.
Exosome LRRK2 was therefore measured in 79 healthy controls and 79 PD patients (Table 
1). Expanded immunoblots utilizing Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2, total LRRK2, and TSG101 
antibodies in this study are included in Supplementary Figure S1. Total LRRK2 and 
Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 signal are within a range of detection where a linear relationship 
existed between signal and target concentration (Supplementary Figure S1 C–D). This 
allows for minimal technical variation with this assay. Representative western blot images 
used to calculate Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2, total LRRK2, and TSG101 levels in the cohort study 
are presented in Supplementary Figure S2. No correlation was identified between the time in 
the freezer for the urine and observed values for any of the exosome proteins including 
Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels (r = −0.0473 [−0.2035, 0.1111]).
Statistical Analysis
For continuous variables we compared controls and PD patients using Student’s t-test or 
Mann-Whitney U test when assumptions of a t-test may not be met. Fisher’s exact test was 
used to test the association between disease status and categorical variables. For assessing 
correlations, Pearson product-moment coefficients were calculated. As clinical measures of 
disease severity are highly correlated we report exact p-values as recommended by the 
Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals18. In addition, we 
also report adjusted p values to account for potential false discovery using the Benjamini and 
Hochberg method19. Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels were log10-transformed to better meet 
model assumptions and were included in an ANCOVA model adjusted for gender and total 
LRRK2 levels as model covariates (see Supplemental Table S2 for details on the gender 
relationship). PD cases alone, controls alone, and PD and controls combined, were stratified 
into quartiles based on Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels and differences in clinical measures of 
disease severity between quartiles were compared with Mann-Whitney U test. All statistical 
analyses and graphs were generated in JMP Pro 10 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) or 
GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Significance was ascribed 
to p-value < 0.05, and all significance levels presented are two-tailed.
Results
Characteristics of study participants where exosome proteins could be measured (79 cases 
and 79 controls) are summarized in Table 1. Demographic characteristics were similar 
between cases and controls. MoCA scores as low as 17 (with a median of 26) were recorded 
in the healthy control population. In this cohort, no significant differences were observed in

 frequencies of alcohol consumption, smoking, benzodiazepine use, antidepressant use, non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory use, or vitamin and supplement use, between cases and controls. 
In evaluation of exosome preparations from both cases and controls, TSG101 levels were 
similar in concentration (Mann Whitney U test, p = 0.2472), and in both males and females 
(Mann Whitney U test, p = 0.3048). These results indicate that exosome concentrations were 
similar between groups. In several control subjects, we evaluated Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels 
in urinary exosomes over the course of several weeks as well as in afternoon versus morning 
collections of urine, and we found good intra-individual stability for Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 
levels in these subjects (Supplementary Figure S1 E–F).
Unadjusted Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels in urinary exosomes were elevated in PD versus 
controls in the complete cohort (Figure 1, p = 0.0014). Gender affected Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 
levels (~3-fold higher median levels in males versus females, Supplementary Table S2). 
Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels were elevated in PD females compared to female controls (~7.5-
fold higher median values in PD, p = 0.0028, Mann-Whitney U). In contrast, there was a 
less-significant trend toward elevated Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels in male PD cases 
compared to male controls (~1.5-fold higher median values in PD, p = 0.0822, Mann-
Whitney U). We found no correlation between Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels and patient age (r 
= 0.0473, p = 0.5587) or disease duration among those with PD (r = −0.0172, p = 0.8813). 
Levels of total LRRK2 protein positively correlated with Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels (r = 
0.44, p < 0.0001). When adjusting for the effects of gender and total LRRK2 levels, 
Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels remained significantly elevated in the entire PD cohort compared 
to the entire control cohort (p = 0.0286).
The Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 to total LRRK2 ratio in urinary exosomes were calculated and also 
elevated in PD versus controls (~1.5-fold higher median values in PD, p = 0.0074). Gender 
affected the ratio value as well (~1.6-fold higher median levels in males versus females). 
The ratio of phospho- to total LRRK2 was also elevated in PD females compared to female 
controls (~2.9-fold higher median values in PD, p = 0.008, Mann-Whitney U). Similar to 
raw Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels, there was an elevated ratio in male PD cases compared to 
male controls but this was not significant (~1.6-fold higher median values in PD, p = 0.1907, 
Mann-Whitney U).
Table 2 summarizes correlations between Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels and clinical measures 
of PD. Non-motor aspects of PD captured with MDS-UPDRS part II, and Epworth SS were 
significantly and positively correlated with Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels after adjustment for 
false discovery (Table 2). Significant associations between Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels and 
Modified S&E v1.0 were also identified. There was no association between Ser(P)-1292 
LRRK2 levels and levodopa equivalent daily dose (r = 0.1512, p = 0.3933).
Patients with PD in the upper quartile of Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels had worse performance 
in the Modified S&E v1.0 and Epworth SS scores than those in the lower quartile 
Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 group, as well as a trending difference in MoCA scores (Table 3). 
However, worse performance in the MoCA was also detected in control subjects that had the 
highest levels of Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 (Table 3).

 Among PD patients, Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels predicted poor MoCA and S&E scores with 
some success (Figure 2). Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels predicted the lower quartile of poor 
MoCA performance with a ROC area under the curve c-statistic of 0.731 (Figure 2B). 
Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels were likewise elevated in PD patients with lower S&E scores (p 
= 0.0061, Figure 2C). Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels predicted the lower quartile of poorer S&E 
scores with a ROC area under the curve of 0.788 (Figure 2D). However, performance on 
MoCA did not predict S&E scores in our cohort (r = 0.0737 [−0.1514, 0.2914], p = 0.5216). 
Only half of the PD cases in the lower quartile of S&E scores were also in the lower quartile 
of MoCA scores. Thus Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels appear to predict several aspects of PD 
disease severity.
Discussion
This is the first study assessing Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels in a large group of idiopathic PD 
cases and controls. To evaluate Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 protein in idiopathic PD patients, we 
prioritized the collection of urine as a non-invasively derived biofluid in a typical medicated 
PD population. In a cross-sectional cohort of idiopathic PD patients enrolled in the 
Parkinson’s Disease Biomarker Program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, we 
found exosome Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels were significantly elevated in PD and evidence 
of correlation with multiple non-motor measures of PD including MoCA, MDS-UPDRS 
Part I and II, and Epworth SS, as well as global measures of successful daily living (Mod. 
S&E v1.0 and PDQ-39).
We did not detect significant associations between Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 and motor 
impairment despite demonstration in larger studies that motor impairment scores do worsen 
over time in PD patients. In our cohort, patients were on medication at the time of clinical 
evaluation and sample donation, and our power to separate mild from moderate motor 
impairment was efficiently masked by dopaminergic therapies. For example, in this cohort 
of 79 PD cases, we had a poor correlation of MDS-UPDRS III scores and disease duration 
(r=−0.0216, p = 0.8521). Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels may not successfully predict motor 
impairment in PD, or Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 may be useful to predict motor impairment in 
non-medicated PD cases. Future studies are required to test these hypotheses.
Given a possible correlation between Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 and MoCA performance, it would 
be of interest to determine if Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels correlate with measures of 
symptom severity in patients diagnosed with Diffuse Lewy Body disease. Levels of exosome 
Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 may generally predict cognitive impairment associated with α-
synuclein. Or, Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels may not be specific for predicting cognitive 
decline in α-synuclein linked disease. Specificity for Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 as a biomarker 
for cognitive impairment in PD versus other causes of impairment like Alzheimer disease 
can be determined in future studies.
We found no evidence of association between LEDD levels and Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels 
(or any other reported medication) that would alter the relationship between Ser(P)-1292 
LRRK2 and non-motor measures of PD severity. Recent observations in G2019S-LRRK2 
mutation carriers demonstrated that Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 was relatively insensitive to

 medication because levels of Ser(P)-1292 were not different between medicated groups and 
non-medicated groups compared to G2019S-LRRK2 mutation carriers11. However, future 
studies to evaluate Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 in de novo groups of PD patients that are not yet 
medicated as well as longitudinal series would be beneficial to better understand the 
relationship of Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 and measures of disease progression and severity.
LRRK2 has been genetically linked to neurodegenerative disease, and we have recently 
demonstrated that the G2019S-LRRK2 mutation elevates urinary exosome Ser(P)-1292 
LRRK2 levels ~5-fold above controls11. Here, we have identified some PD cases, as well as 
a few controls, that show comparable levels of Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 as G2019S-LRRK2 
mutation carriers with PD. Overall idiopathic PD with the highest levels of Ser(P)-1292 
LRRK2 also demonstrated worse performance on clinical assessments of daily living 
impairment and cognitive performance.
The biological source of urinary Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 in our exosome preparations has not 
been determined which is a limitation to interpretation of our results. LRRK2 is highly 
expressed in cells of the innate immune system and it has recently been demonstrated that 
inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide can induce increased levels of LRRK2 
autophosphorylation and exosomal release20. A possible explanation for increased 
Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels in PD patients with poorer scores on assessments of cognitive 
performance and activities of daily living may be increased inflammation in the patients with 
aggressive progression of disease. Elevations in several cytokines have been observed in the 
CSF of PD patients as well as increased plasma C-reactive protein levels with correlations to 
PD severity21–24. Multivariate modeling for most of these inflammation markers also 
observed significant gender effects, potentially in line with observations from this study.
In PD, there are currently no validated biochemical biomarkers for independently assessing 
PD diagnosis or prognosis, or measuring disease severity25. In Alzheimer disease (AD), CSF 
levels of Aβ42, in concert with total tau and phosphorylated tau levels, may have value in 
identifying prodromal AD26. However, levels of CSF Aβ42 and tau stabilize when a patient 
has clinically manifested AD and thus fail to inform on disease progression. In PD, CSF 
levels of Aβ42, total tau, phospho-tau, and α-synuclein have been proposed to have 
prognostic and diagnostic value in early-stage PD27. However, each study reported major 
limitations for practical diagnostic or prognostic utility of α-synuclein, tau, or phospho-tau 
in PD28–32. Here, we observed that Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels associated with several 
features of PD. As few viable biomarkers for PD exist, particularly for non-motor features33, 
Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 may be a promising candidate for further exploration.

 Figure 1. Elevated Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels in PD
Urinary exosomes were isolated from 79 healthy and 79 PD patients and quantities of 
Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 were determined relative to an exosome reference pool (defined as 1.0). 
Unadjusted values for Ser(P)-1292-LRRK2 are shown, ** p < 0.01, Mann-Whitney U-test.

 Figure 2. Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 changes as stratified by patient Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
and Modified Schwab and England v1.0 Score
(A) Exosomal Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 levels progressively increase with declining MoCA 
score in PD cases. Levels are significantly different across quartiles (p = 0.05, Kruskal-
Wallis) (B) Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve for Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 
prediction of the lower quartile of MoCA performance. Risk prediction is success is 0.731 
with a sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 89% at the optimum threshold. (C) Ser(P)-1292 
LRRK2 levels increase with declining S&E scores. Levels are significantly different across 
quartiles (p = 0.0061, Kruskal-Wallis). (D) ROC Curve analysis of Ser(P)-1292 LRRK2 
levels distinguishing lower S&E quartile. Area under the ROC curve is 0.788 with a 
sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 90% at optimum threshold.
