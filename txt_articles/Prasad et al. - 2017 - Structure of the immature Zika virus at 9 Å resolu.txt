Abstract
The current Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic is characterized by severe pathogenicity in both children 
and adults. Sequence changes in ZIKV since its first isolation, are apparent when comparing “pre-
epidemic” strains with those causing the current epidemic. However, the residues that are 
responsible for ZIKV pathogenicity are largely unknown. Here, we report the cryo-electron 
microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the immature ZIKV at 9 Å resolution. The cryo-EM map was 
fitted with the crystal structures of the precursor membrane and envelope glycoproteins and was 
shown to be similar to the structures of other known immature flaviviruses. However, the 
immature ZIKV contains a partially ordered capsid protein shell that is less prominent in other 
immature flaviviruses. Furthermore, six amino acids near the interface between pr domains at the 
top of the spikes were found to be different between the “pre-epidemic” and “epidemic” ZIKV, 
possibly influencing the composition and structure of the resulting viruses.
The current Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic, which started in Brazil in 2015, has given rise to 
reports of microcephaly in fetuses1 and Guillian Barre syndrome2 in adults. ZIKV is a 
member of the Flaviviridae family and, like some other flaviviruses, is transmitted by 
mosquitos. The flaviviruses include other significant human pathogens such as dengue virus 
(DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV) and Japanese encephalitis virus 
(JEV)3. Flaviviruses are enveloped viruses containing a single-stranded, positive-sense, 
RNA genome of ~11kb (ref. 3). The RNA genome is complexed with multiple capsid 
protein molecules, surrounded by a membrane, in virions4. The extracellular, mature form of 
the virus has an outer surface that forms an icosahedral shell with 90 dimers of the envelope 
(E) (~495 amino acids) and the membrane (M) (~75 amino acids) proteins, arranged in a

 “herring-bone” pattern5. The E glycoprotein is involved in receptor binding, attachment and 
virus fusion during cell entry4. The M protein is mostly unexposed and has a significant 
transmembrane component. The cryo-EM structures of different, mature flaviviruses5–7 
including ZIKV8, 9 are known and have a similar overall architecture (Fig. 1a and b). During 
infection of host cells, virions first assemble into an immature form of the virus in the 
endoplasmic recticulum3. The immature virus is composed of 60 trimeric spikes of the 
precursor membrane (prM) and E proteins where the pr domain (~90 amino acids) of the 
prM protein protects the fusion loop on the E protein from non-productive interactions 
within the cell10. In the low pH environment of the trans-Golgi network, the immature 
virions undergo proteolytic processing by furin, a cellular protease11, and the pr domain is 
cleaved from the prM protein during maturation. The virus then releases the pr domain to 
form the mature virion on exit from cells12.
Although only the mature form of the virus is considered infectious; due to varying 
efficiency of pr cleavage in flaviviruses3, the virus population secreted from host cells is a 
mixture of mature, partially mature and immature virions. Immature forms of flaviviruses 
such as DENV13 and WNV14 can become infectious through antibody dependent entry of 
host cells. ZIKV is no exception to this observation of a mixed population of virus 
maturation states on release from infected cells. It is, thus, probable that the immature form 
of ZIKV also plays a role in virus infection and spread.
Here, we report a cryo-EM structure of the immature ZIKV (H/PF/2013 strain of Asian 
lineage) at a resolution of 9 Å. This structure has been used to fit the crystal structures of the 
prM and E proteins into the cryo-EM map and compared with immature virion structures 
from other flaviviruses.
RESULTS
Cryo-EM structure of immature ZIKV
Mosquito C6/36 cells were infected with ZIKV (strain H/PF/2013) for 16hrs at 30°C 
followed by addition of NH4Cl to produce immature virions. The purified immature ZIKV 
was plunge frozen on grids and examined using an FEI Titan Krios electron microscope with 
a Gatan K2 Summit detector. Although the purified viruses were predominantly spiky, as 
expected for immature particles, they appeared to have some heterogeneity. A total of 9315 
particles were selected and used to generate a cryo-EM map at a resolution of 9.1 Å based 
on the 0.143 Fourier shell correlation criterion (Supplementary Fig. 1).
The cryo-EM reconstruction of the immature ZIKV has a spiky appearance with a diameter 
of approximately 600 Å (Fig. 1c and d). Densities for the individual prM-E heterodimers 
within the spikes are clearly visible in the immature ZIKV cryo-EM map. In addition, the 
individual transmembrane regions of the E and M proteins are easily recognizable. The 
crystal structure of the DENV-2 prM-E ectodomain heterodimer (PDB ID: 3C6E)15 was 
fitted into the immature ZIKV cryo-EM map at the three independent positions with one 
trimeric spike (Methods and Supplementary Fig. 2a–c). The transmembrane helices of the 
M and E proteins from the mature ZIKV were also fitted individually into the 
transmembrane densities in the immature ZIKV cryo-EM map (Supplementary Fig. 2d). A

 comparison of these fitted components in ZIKV to the complete trimeric prM-E spike of 
immature DENV-1 (ref.16) showed little difference in spatial arrangement.
Glycosylation in immature ZIKV
The fitting procedure showed that Asn 69 of the pr domain in ZIKV is glycosylated, as also 
in DENV (Supplementary Fig. 3a), but the glycosylation at Asn 67 position on the DENV E 
protein is not preserved in ZIKV (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Additional density was also 
found associated with each of the three Asn 154 residues in the immature ZIKV 
(Supplementary Fig. 3c), showing that Asn 154 is glycosylated as expected from the protein 
sequence. Similarly, Asn 154 on the E protein is glycosylated in the mature ZIKV and was 
found to cover the fusion loop in the adjacent E monomer, suggesting that this site maybe 
important for viral entry8.
Inner shell of capsid protein in immature ZIKV
Residual density is observed between the inner membrane layer and the RNA core (Fig. 1d). 
The density is immediately below the base of each of the spikes and has a volume and shape 
that matches that of dimeric capsid protein structure17, 18 (Fig. 1d and Fig. 2a–d). This 
potential capsid density is more evident in immature ZIKV than in immature DENV-1 (ref. 
16). Mature flavivirus structures5, 8 lack density in this region (Fig. 1b), suggesting a 
rearrangement of the capsid shell during maturation. The capsid density is in contact with 
the inner layer of the viral membrane and is close to the transmembrane domains of the E 
and M proteins, suggesting interactions that might be essential during virion assembly. The 
other benefit provided by the formation of an inner shell of capsid proteins is for recruitment 
of the viral genome. Moreover, the advantage of having a somewhat unstable inner core, as 
shown here for ZIKV, could be to facilitate transfer of the genome into a host cell during 
infection.
Interactions between prM-E heterodimers of the trimeric spikes
The three prM-E hetrodimers that form a spike in immature flaviviruses are not related by 
three-fold symmetry. Thus the interactions of any one of the three heterodimers with the two 
others in a spike is different. The trimeric spike in immature ZIKV is held together at its 
external tip through interactions between the pr domains and the fusion loop of one of the E 
proteins (Fig. 3a and b). The residues involved in these interactions between prM-E 
heterodimers within the spikes can be deduced from the DENV-2 prM-E crystal structure 
fitted into the trimeric spike density of ZIKV and the sequence alignment of prM-E for 
DENV-2 and ZIKV (H/PF/2013) (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 
1). Apart from these interactions at the top of the trimeric spikes, the base of the spike is 
stabilized by interactions between residues in domain III of the ZIKV-E protein in one spike 
to the domain II of E protein from an adjacent spike (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 4 and 
Supplementary Table 1).
Amongst flaviviruses, the prM protein has the lowest percentage identity (~40%) when 
compared to the other viral proteins. Even when comparing between different strains of 
ZIKV, the pr domain has the highest percentage of changes in its amino acid sequence 
compared to other ZIKV proteins19. There are six amino acid changes in the pr domain

 between pre-epidemic and epidemic ZIKV strains and all of these are contained in the ~40 
amino acids at the start of the pr domain19 (Fig. 3). These amino acid changes cluster near 
the interface between pr domains which are involved in the interactions within trimeric 
spikes (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 4). A few of these amino acid substitutions involve 
dramatic changes in the polarity of the residues, for example, Lys-21 and His-35 in pre-
epidemic ZIKV strains are substituted by Glu-21 and Tyr-35 in the epidemic strains. 
Similarly, change in Val-26 to Pro-26 between the pre-epidemic to epidemic ZIKV strains 
can potentially affect the local Cα backbone structure in the pr domain. Thus, these amino 
acid changes possess the ability to alter the nature of interactions within a trimer spike 
among the different strains of ZIKV.
DISCUSSION
Comparison between the residues near the interface within trimeric spikes in DENV to that 
in the epidemic ZIKV strains shows that the interface in DENV is more positively charged 
than in ZIKV (Supplementary Fig. 4). Lack of such closely positioned positively charged 
residues in ZIKV could imply comparatively more stable interactions within spikes in 
immature ZIKV. This would have an effect on the dynamics of conformational change 
between the immature and mature virion states, wherein the trimeric spikes have to break 
contacts to form the dimeric interactions seen in mature virions. Thus, ZIKV may have a 
tendency to have a higher proportion of partially immature virions in their populations than 
completely mature virions. This partial maturation of virions is seen in all flaviviruses, but 
the degree of heterogeneity of virion particles varies between flaviviruses3. A structurally 
heterogeneous virion population is advantageous to a viral pathogen, as it limits the uniform 
availability of neutralizing epitopes on the virion, making it more challenging for the host 
immune system to inhibit the virus. This phenomenon is not only observed with other 
flaviviruses, such as WNV20, 21, but also for other debilitating viruses such as HIV-1 (refs. 
22, 23). In addition, non-neutralizing antibody responses can be counteractively used by 
ZIKV for antibody-dependent entry of host cells24, 25. Thus, local differences between 
ZIKV strains, could modulate the sensitivity of ZIKV to antibodies and impact the potency 
of viral infection.
ONLINE METHODS
Virus preparation and purification
Approximately 1 × 109 C6/36 cells (ATCC CRL-1660) were infected with Zika virus (strain 
H/PF/2013) at a multiplicity of infection of 4 for 16hrs at 30°C. The inoculum was removed 
and cells were rinsed three times with phosphate buffered saline (pH 8.0) and incubated for 
two hours at 30°C in minimal essential media containing 2% fetal bovine serum, 25mM 
HEPES pH 7.3, and 30mM NH4Cl. The process was repeated two more times for a total of 
three incubations at 30°C in cell culture media containing 30mM NH4Cl. Media was 
collected 72 hours post infection and immature virus particles were purified according to 
previously described methods12. Briefly, virus particles were precipitated from the media by 
overnight mixing with 8% polyethylene glycol 8000 at 4°C. This mixture was then pelleted 
at 8900×g for 50 minutes at 4°C. Resuspended particles were pelleted through a 24%

 sucrose cushion, resuspended in 0.5mL NTE buffer (20mM Tris pH 8.0, 120mM NaCl, 
1mM EDTA) and purified with a discontinuous gradient in 5% intervals from 35% to 10% 
K-tartrate, 20mM Tris pH 8.0 and 1mM EDTA. Immature virus was extracted from the 
gradient, concentrated and buffer exchanged into NTE buffer.
Cryo-electron microscopy data collection
The purified immature ZIKV sample was plunge frozen on ultrathin lacey carbon EM grids 
(Electron Microscopy Sciences). The grids were examined using an FEI Titan Krios electron 
microscope with a Gatan K2 Summit detector. Cryo-EM images were collected at a 
magnification of 22,500× in the “super-resolution” data collection mode. The pixel size of 
the collected images was 0.65 Å. The total exposure time for producing one image 
composed of 38 frames was 7.6 s and required a dose rate of 4.7 electrons Å−2 s−1. A total of 
3341 images were collected and 14351 particles were boxed manually using the e2boxer 
program from the EMAN2 software26.
Three-dimensional reconstruction and data analysis
Non-reference two-dimensional classification was performed using the Relion software 
package27 resulting in the selection of 9315 particles. This dataset was split into two equal 
subsets as required by the “gold standard” for determining the quality of the cryo-EM 
reconstruction. The jspr program28 was used for initial model generation and refinement of 
the orientations of the selected particles. The selected particles were used to generate a cryo-
EM map at an average resolution of 9.34 Å based on the 0.143 Fourier shell correlation 
criterion. After the application of soft spherical masks, the resolution improved to 9.14 Å.
Fitting of crystal structures into the cryo-EM map
The crystal structure of immature dengue virus-2 prM-E heterodimer (PDB ID: 3C6E) was 
used for fitting into a trimeric spike in the immature ZIKV map. Sequential fitting of the 
three prM-E molecules into the trimeric spike density was carried out using the UCSF 
Chimera software29. The Cα backbone of the transmembrane helices of M and E proteins 
from the mature ZIKV structure (PDB ID: 5IRE) were also fitted into the transmembrane 
regions of the three prM-E heterodimers. The solution structure of DENV-2 capsid protein 
(PDB ID: 1R6R) was placed into the density between the inner layer of the viral membrane 
and the RNA core of immature ZIKV, according to previously suggested orientation of the 
capsid protein in the virion17. The mature ZIKV E protein’s ectodomain structure (PDB ID: 
5IRE)8 was split into two parts, with one molecule containing the domain I plus III and the 
second molecule containing domain II. These different parts were superposed independently 
on the immature dengue prM-E molecule for determining the interaction regions between E 
proteins from adjacent spikes. Interface regions between different protein partners were 
identified as residues with less than 6 Å distance between their corresponding Cα 
backbones.
Multiple sequence alignment
Sequence alignments of the pr domain and E glycoprotein amongst flaviviruses were carried 
out using the MAFFT program30 and rendered using the ESPript software31. The sequences

 for comparison were obtained from the ViPR resource database32. The representative 
flavivirus strains used in the comparison were Zika-Asian (H/PF/2013 strain), Zika-African 
(1968-Nigeria strain), West Nile virus (NY99 strain), Japanese encephalitis virus (SA14), 
yellow fever virus (Asibi strain) and the four dengue virus serotypes (Western Pacific, 
S16803, CH53489 and IND1979 strains). In the manuscript, the residue numbers for pr and 
E are used based on the ZIKV sequence and structure, though the numbers assigned to the 
residues during multiple sequence alignment may have slightly shifted in Supplementary 
Fig. 4.
