BACKGROUND: Since the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screen-
ing, there have been conflicting reports regarding the impact on the behavior of providers. This study analyzed real-world data on
PSA ordering and referral practices in the years surrounding the recommendation. METHODS: A whole-institution sample of entered
PSA orders and urology referrals was obtained from the electronic medical record. The study was performed at a tertiary referral cen-
ter with a catchment in the southern United States. PSA examinations were defined as screening when they were ordered by pro-
viders with appointments in internal medicine, family medicine, or general internal medicine. Linear and quadratic regression analyses
were performed, and joinpoint regression was used to assess for trend inflection points. RESULTS: Between January 2010 and July
2015, there were 275,784 unique ambulatory visits for men. There were 63,722 raw PSA orders, and 54,684 were evaluable. Primary
care providers ordered 17,315 PSA tests and 858 urology referrals. The number of PSA tests per ambulatory visit, the number of refer-
rals per ambulatory visit, the age at the time of the urology referral, and the proportion of PSA tests performed outside the recom-
mended age range did not significantly change. The PSA value at the time of referral increased significantly (P 5.022). Joinpoint
analysis revealed no joinpoints in the analysis of total PSA orders, screening PSA tests, or examinations per 100 visits. CONCLUSIONS:
In the years surrounding the USPSTF recommendation, PSA behavior did not change significantly. Patients were referred at progres-
sively higher average PSA levels. The implications for prostate cancer outcomes from these trends warrant further research into pro-
vider variables associated with actual PSA utilization. Cancer 2016;122:3785-93. V

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in US men.1 Since the 1990s, primary screening for prostate
cancer in the United States has relied on prostate-specific antigen (PSA),2 a serum marker of prostatic tissue identified at
the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in 1979.3 The PSA test for clinical use was first approved by the Food and Drug Admin-
istration in 1986 for monitoring recurrence and responses to treatment and later for the early detection of prostate cancer.4
Despite a 39% decline in prostate cancer–specific mortality since 1991, controversy about the benefits and harms of PSA-
based screening remain.1
The results of large randomized controlled trials of prostate cancer screening in the United States and Europe did
not resolve this controversy. In 2009, the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial reported no sig-
nificant difference in death due to prostate cancer between controls receiving the usual care and men randomized to annu-
al screening.5 A high rate of PSA-based screening in the control group has been noted as a factor in the failure to detect a
prostate cancer mortality difference between groups,5 and recent revelations about the severe nature of control group con-
tamination have called into question the findings of this study.6 Meanwhile, the European Randomized Study of Screen-
ing for Prostate Cancer and Goteborg screening trials reported that PSA-based screening significantly reduced prostate
cancer mortality.7,8 Although the European trials reported less PSA screening noncompliance in controls, the absolute re-
duction in prostate cancer mortality was modest, and the number-needed-to-treat statistics to prevent 1 cancer death were
highly variable. This supported concerns that PSA-based screening contributes to overtreatment and overdiagnosis.7,8

Original Article
 In May 2012, the US Preventive Services Task Force
(USPSTF) issued a grade D recommendation against the
use of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men of
all ages.9 It concluded that the harms of overtreatment
outweigh the benefits of early detection.9 In early 2013,
the American Academy of Family Physicians adopted the
USPSTF recommendation,10 and the American College
of Physicians published a guidance statement recom-
mending a shared decision-making approach with men
between the ages of 50 and 69 years and advising against
screening in all other age groups.11
Previous studies evaluating the impact of the
USPSTF recommendation on PSA-based screening prac-
tices were limited in their duration or level of detail.12-16
Moreover, they relied heavily on patient-reported survey
data, which are subject to both recall and attribution
biases, especially with respect to a topic discussed as con-
tentiously as PSA screening. We sought to evaluate the ef-
fect of the USPSTF recommendation on PSA testing and
urology referral behavior in a large tertiary care academic
medical center by evaluating behavior before and after the
recommendation in a whole-institution sample of PSA
orders and urology referrals.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
An institutional review board–approved, retrospective ad-
ministrative database of all ambulatory patient visits,
referrals, and PSA-based laboratory test results for ambu-
latory patients at a single tertiary care institution in the
United States was analyzed. Dates between January 1,
2010, and July 31, 2015, were included to determine be-
havior before and after the USPSTF recommendation.
PSA examinations were limited to male patients. No
exclusions to PSA examinations were made on the basis of
patient age, race, family history, or medical condition.
For raw PSA orders in 2015, the average number of
examinations per month was considered to continue after
July for trend analyses. PSA examinations included the to-
tal PSA and PSA panel (including free and total PSA), re-
gardless of the screening or diagnostic modifier. PSA tests
were excluded that were ordered but were not collected
(the patient did not provide a sample) or lacked a result
(the sample was inadequate for analysis). Patient age (by
decade) and referral status were features of the data set,
whereas the medical comorbidity status was not. The
screening status of a PSA order was determined by the aca-
demic department of the provider; specifically, providers
in internal medicine, family medicine, general internal
medicine, and related subdivisions who ordered PSA
examinations in an ambulatory care setting were consid-
ered to be performing screening behavior. We excluded
PSA tests ordered by providers appointed in the depart-
ments of urology, oncology, and radiation oncology and
other non–primary care specialties from this cohort. For
PSA tests performed in primary care environments, PSA
orders were linked to the supervising physician. A diagram
outlining the derivation of the data set is included as
Figure 1.
For the appropriateness of age-related PSA screen-
ing, the American Urological Association (AUA) guide-
lines’ recommendation of shared decision making for
men aged 55 to 70 years was used: men who were 50 years

 old or younger or were older than 70 years were consid-
ered outside the range, men who were 60 to 70 years old
were considered within the range, and men who were 50
to 60 years old were excluded. To analyze the effect of
PSA tests being rechecked by primary care providers be-
fore a urology referral, we assessed PSA tests ordered by
primary care providers for repetition within 90 days in the
same patient and defined these as PSA rechecks. Same-
provider ordering was not required so long as both pro-
viders were in a primary care field.
Patients
Identifying patient characteristics were blinded. Patients
were subdivided by the PSA level within set categories (0-
2.5, 2.5-4, 4-6.5, and �6.5 ng/mL), by the age by decade
(�50, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, and �80 y), and by referral
status. An elevated PSA level was considered a result
above 4 ng/mL; this was in keeping with the denomina-
tion in the electronic medical record (EPIC, Verona,
Wis). A referral was considered any electronically entered
referral to a urology provider, regardless of the charged
diagnosis.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis and curve estimation were performed
with SPSS 22 (IBM). Intergroup proportion comparisons
were performed as paired 2-tailed t tests with the level of
significance set at P 5 .05. For temporal trends, the total
number of PSA orders was divided by the yearly patient
visit volume to correct for changes in institutional growth.
Assessments of temporal trends were modeled with linear
and quadratic (second-degree polynomial) regression esti-
mations, and the statistical significance for trend was
assessed with a linear or quadratic analysis of variance
with the significance set at P 5 .05. Trends were assessed
as linear temporal trends because of the temporal evolu-
tion of the USPSTF statement on PSA and subsequent
coverage in the primary care literature and lay press as a
progressive event over the time period.
To assess for possible pre- and postrecommendation
changes in trends of PSA ordering and referral behavior, a
joinpoint regression analysis was performed over the en-
tire period for total PSA orders, PSA orders per ambulato-
ry visit, screening PSA tests, and referrals per PSA order.
Joinpoint is a method of regression analysis that screens
for an increased fit of straight regression lines when join-
points are introduced; this allows the identification of
changes in temporal trends.17 Joinpoints were examined
for data with 2 flanking points and at a single joinpoint.
We hypothesized that if a significant difference in trend
were observed because of the 2012 recommendation, then a
compound regression line with a joinpoint near 2012
would better fit the data than a straight line. Joinpoint anal-
ysis software was provided free of charge by the National
Cancer Institute’s Surveillance Research Program.18
RESULTS
The total number of male ambulatory care visits for the
study was 275,784 (annual range, 43,170-51,292), and
there was a trend toward progressively higher patient vol-
umes that was not statistically significant (P 5 .94). The to-
tal number of resulted PSA examinations (including same-
patient repeat examinations) for all providers similarly
ranged from 7869 to 10,919 annually with a positive trend
that was also insignificant according to an analysis of vari-
ance (P 5 .95). Primary care provider PSA orders ranged
from 2169 to 3226 and were not significant for any trend
(P5 .18). Annual urology referrals ranged from 132 to
167 and were not significant for any trend (P 5 .46). A to-
tal of 81 unique primary care providers ordered PSA
examinations during the time period. A detailed annual
breakdown of these figures is contained in Table 1.
The mean age at referral was 65.6 years in 2010,
63.1 years in 2011, 63.1 years in 2012, 63.1 years in

 2013, 64.8 years in 2014, and 64.7 years in 2015, and
there was no discernable trend (P 5 .96). The mean num-
ber of PSA examinations (including repeat same-patient
examinations) per ambulatory care visit (including repeat
visits) was 0.0687, 0.0631, 0.0618, 0.0622, 0.0808, and
0.0699 in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015
(through July), respectively (P 5 .39), and the mean num-
ber of urology referrals per visit was 0.00306, 0.00368,
0.00319, 0.00308, 0.00326, and 0.00229, respectively
(P 5 .19). These data are presented in Table 1 and are vi-
sualized in Figures 2 and 3. The mean PSA results at the
time of the urology referral were 2.49, 2.46, 2.56, 2.72,
3.06, and 3.84 ng/mL in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014,
and 2015 (through July), respectively, and this was signifi-
cant in both the linear regression analysis (P 5 .022) and
the quadratic regression analysis (P 5 .002). A visualiza-
tion of these data and a breakdown by patient age (greater
or less than 60 years) are included in Figure 4.
The proportions of PSA tests performed outside the
recommended range were 0.40, 0.42, 0.39, 0.39, 0.40,

ized in Figure 5. PSA examinations and referrals per PSA

 were significant for either PSA tests ordered per visit
(P 5 .65, P 5 .33, P 5 .89, P 5 .79, and P 5 .90, respec-
tively) or referrals per PSA examination by age (P 5 .23,
P 5 .49, P 5 .81, P 5 .18, and P 5 .49, respectively);
these data are represented in Figures 6 and 7. For detailed
rates and a summary of the analyses, please see Supporting
Table 1 in the online supporting information.
We found 420 total PSA rechecks (2.4% of all PSA
examinations ordered by primary care providers) with
incidences of 75, 100, 79, 79, 53, and 34 (projected 58.3)
in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 (through
July), respectively, and this was not significant for any
trend (R2 5 0.509, P 5 .11).
Joinpoint analysis demonstrated no additional join-
points when total PSA examinations, screening PSA exami-
nations, and PSA examinations per 100 visits were
examined (P> .05). Conversely, when urology referrals
per screening PSA examination were examined, a joinpoint
arose at 2013 (Fig. 8); this indicated that a compound line-
ar regression line incorporating the joinpoint better fit the
assessed data points (P < .05) and might signal a down-
ward trend after the recommendation. A summary of linear
regression analyses performed for the statistical significance
of each factor in the analysis of variance, including screen-
ing PSA examinations per outpatient visit (analyzed with-
out the identified joinpoint), can be found in Table 1. It
indicates that none of the aforementioned factors analyzed
by joinpoint analysis were significant for linear trends.

 PSA-based screening for prostate cancer is no exception.
The recommendation has raised concerns that a reduction
in PSA-based screening in the United States will lead to a
delay in diagnosis and an increase in the incidence of later
stage prostate cancer.12-14,20 The recommendation’s de-
gree of impact on PSA-based screening and prostate can-
cer outcomes remains an active area of investigation, with
multiple studies using national registry and survey data to
examine macroscopic trends in PSA usage.21,22
We did not identify a significant change in the use of
PSA-based screening as measured by the total annual
number of resultant PSA examinations or the average
number of PSA examinations per ambulatory care visit.
This differs from the results reported by earlier studies
showing a decline in PSA-based screening in the period
immediately following the publication of the USPSTF
recommendation.15,16,23 Cohn et al15 identified men be-
tween the ages of 40 and 79 years who were evaluated by
an internist or family physician during a 6-month period
before or after the USPSTF recommendation, and they
found that the proportion of men who had a PSA test per-
formed in the postrecommendation cohort was signifi-
cantly lower than that in the prerecommendation cohort
(7.6% vs 8.6%); this finding was driven in large part by
decreased screening in old men (>70 years) and young
men (<50 years) outside nearly all recommended screen-
ing age ranges. Using National Health Interview Survey
data, Drazer et al16 and Li et al23 found a significant de-
cline in PSA screening when they compared 2013 survey
results with survey data collected in years before the rec-
ommendation. These 2 studies were limited by the utiliza-
tion of survey data, which may not correlate with real-

 world practice, especially in the context of a public health
issue with significant public exposure and controversy.
Recall bias is of particular concern24 in studies evaluating
highly publicized issues. In the case of PSA testing specifi-
cally, patient self-reporting may be hindered because pro-
viders may order blood work panels including the PSA
test without prior discussion with the patient.25
A state-by-state breakdown of the impact of the rec-
ommendation has been recently presented by Abdollah
et al.26 This study also used survey data (the Behavioral
Risk Factor Surveillance System) and identified our state,
Texas, specifically in the quartile with the greatest decrease
in PSA screening (–5% to –7.5%). This provides our in-
stitution a unique perspective for evaluating the changes
in actual practice with respect to large reported survey
data changes.
Our data set encompasses more than 2 years of real-
world data spanning both sides of the USPSTF recom-
mendation. It also includes a specific subset of resultant
PSA tests ordered by noncancer (screening) providers in
an ambulatory care setting. We interpreted a provider or-
dering a PSA test in an ambulatory setting as an indication
that this provider may be serving as a de facto primary
care provider (eg, a patient with diabetes mellitus has reg-
ular follow-up visits most frequently with a diabetic spe-
cialist,
who
also
coordinates
the
patient’s
routine
screening tests for general health). We feel that this is
more reflective of the complexity seen in large referral cen-
ters and the realities of medical practice today. Our results
also reflect a cross-section of such providers, who are likely
influenced to varying degrees by statements from group-
specific guidelines such as those issued by the American
Academy of Family Physicians.
Besides the methodology of the data collection,
there may be additional factors explaining why no change
in PSA-based screening was found in this study. Although
studies have suggested that most primary care physicians
are knowledgeable of USPSTF guidelines on prostate can-
cer screening, the decision to order a screening PSA test is
multifactorial and includes other factors such as patient-
specific risk factors, including the family history, life ex-
pectancy, functional status, and overall health state.25,27
Patient preference plays an important role in prostate can-
cer screening decisions,28 and extensive media coverage of
the USPSTF recommendation19 may have bolstered
some patients to more actively resist cessation of PSA test-
ing. Given the controversy surrounding the recommenda-
tion, some providers may simply disagree with the
recommendation or find guidelines from expert organiza-
tions such as the AUA more compelling. Other providers
may simply continue to perform PSA-based screening out
of habit or because of training.
Despite finding no change in the utilization of PSA-
based screening, this study did find that the average PSA
result at the time of referral was significantly higher than
the average result measured in the period before the rec-
ommendation. Although the average PSA result at the
time of urology referral did increase, the highest average
(3.84 ng/mL in 2015) was still below the institutional lab-
oratory–indicated value of 4.0 ng/mL for elevated results.
Figure 8. A joinpoint analysis of urology referrals per screening PSA examination revealed a joinpoint at 2013 that better fit the
data than a straight regression line; this indicated a possible downturn in trend (P <.05). Joinpoint analyses for total PSA exami-
nations, screening PSA examinations, and PSA examinations per 100 visits did not reveal joinpoints (P >.05 for all). APC indicates
annual percent change; PSA, prostate-specific antigen.

 In practice, this difference may have limited clinical sig-
nificance. Our institution maintains cancer-specific data
on the stages of tumors treated. Over the time period, this
demonstrated no clear change in the stage of treated pros-
tate cancers (see Supporting Fig. 1 in the online support-
ing information); however, this must be viewed in the
context of the majority of patients with treated tumors
having been referred externally for either diagnosis or
management to a tertiary care center. A possible explana-
tion could be a simple mental adjustment of what a partic-
ular provider considers “elevated” to a higher cutoff. The
proportion of PSA tests ordered outside the AUA-
recommended age cutoffs did not change, and this sug-
gests that providers either were making highly patient-
centered decisions for screening or were otherwise not
influenced in their ordering (rather than referral) practices
by recommendations of external panels. Our observation
of no age-specific trends in PSA tests performed by the de-
cade of life or in the proportion of men with a PSA test re-
ceiving a referral bolsters these observations.
These results are more closely concordant with the
effect of other studied urology recommendations on actu-
al clinical practice.29 In general, the adoption of external
advisory recommendations is slow and incremental. Data
presented in prior studies of the effect of the USPSTF rec-
ommendation on screening and cancer incidences seem to
indicate a sharp, rapid change in both PSA screening and
prostate cancer incidence.16,22 The driving forces behind
these dichotomous results warrant a close examination of
the data sets from which they were derived.
A drop in PSA screening rates has been observed in
all studies that have used the National Health Interview
Survey data set, which relies on a single, self-reported, un-
intentionally gathered data point to assess whether
patients report having been screened for prostate cancer
with PSA. This data point is subject both to recall bias
and to the inadvertent bias of patients’ not knowing
whether a PSA test was performed, especially if it was per-
formed as part of a larger blood work panel. In a topic
that has generated significant controversy in the lay press,
these types of biases may be strong.
A drop in prostate cancer incidence since the
USPSTF recommendation has also been observed in stud-
ies using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
data. Although this data set is largely resistant to bias, the
drop-off in prostate cancer diagnoses began in 2007 (even
before the USPSTF recommendation against screening
older men), and there has been a steady downtrend since
then. Whether this is the result of early drafts of USPSTF
proposals even before the 2008 recommendation against
screening men older than 75 years is questionable.
The limitations of this study include its retrospective
nature, its lack of a nonintervention group of providers,
the limitations inherent in a single-site study (including
regional geographic variation), and a run-in period that
may have been influenced by prior USPSTF statements
leading up to the 2012 recommendation. A specific limi-
tation of the data set is the limitation of differentiating
physician and midlevel ordering provider actions because
PSA orders were linked to the supervising physician’s
name. We also examined referrals as a whole rather than
referrals for specific indications because many internal
referrals were for multiple indications such as elevated
PSA levels and voiding issues. It is not possible to deter-
mine whether a patient has been referred primarily for an
elevated PSA level or for another indication because
patients have multiple billed codes and the indication for
a referral is not specified in the electronic medical records.
These results, therefore, may not be generalizable to all
health care models or institutions. Study strengths include
the long run-in and run-out periods surrounding the
2012 recommendation, the large sample size of patients
and PSA examinations, and the ability to correlate the ac-
tual levels of serum PSA to provider actions such as refer-
rals and oncologic outcomes such as cancer stage, with the
aforementioned caveats.
In conclusion, in the years surrounding the USPSTF
recommendation, PSA behavior did not change signifi-
cantly. Patients were referred at progressively higher aver-
age PSA levels. The implications for prostate cancer
outcomes from these trends warrant further research into
provider variables associated with actual PSA utilization.
