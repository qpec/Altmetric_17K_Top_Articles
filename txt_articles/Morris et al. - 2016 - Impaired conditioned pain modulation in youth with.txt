Abstract
Functional abdominal pain (FAP) is associated with enhanced pain responsiveness. Although 
impaired conditioned pain modulation (CPM) characterizes adults with a variety of chronic pain 
conditions, relatively little is known about CPM in youth with FAP. The present study assessed 
CPM to evoked thermal pain in 140 youth (ages 10 to 17), 63 of whom had FAP and 77 of whom 
were healthy controls. Multilevel models demonstrated weaker CPM effects in FAP than healthy 
youth, as evident in slower within-person decreases in pain ratings during the conditioning phase. 
Weaker CPM effects were associated with greater somatic symptom severity and functional 
disability. Pain responses in FAP youth were heterogeneous, with 43% of youth showing an 
unexpected increase in pain ratings during the conditioning phase, suggesting sensitization rather 
than CPM-related pain inhibition. These findings highlight directions for future research on the 
emergence and maintenance of FAP in youth.

Functional abdominal pain (FAP) refers to either episodic or continuous abdominal pain that 
remains medically unexplained despite thorough physical examination [36]. According to a 
recent meta-analysis, FAP is common in youth, with a worldwide pooled prevalence rate of 
13.5% [18]. Many youth with FAP either meet current Rome III criteria for functional

 gastrointestinal disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia 
and abdominal migraine [2], or are at increased risk for developing functional 
gastrointestinal disorders over time [48]. FAP in youth is associated with significant 
functional disability, reflected in part by school absences [36], and is often persistent despite 
frequent utilization of health care services [13]. Although a variety of biological and 
psychosocial factors [48,49] have been implicated in the development and maintenance of 
FAP in youth, little is known about the impact of altered pain modulatory systems.
Experimental pain responses, which may index functioning in pain modulatory systems, 
have proven useful as biomarkers of risk for chronic pain by discriminating clinical pain 
populations from healthy controls, correlating with changes in clinical pain, and predicting 
the development of chronic pain [11]. Pro-nociceptive pain modulation profiles are 
characterized by decreased inhibition and/or increased temporal summation to evoked pain 
[53]. One experimental method used to detect dysfunction in descending inhibitory pain 
modulatory systems is conditioned pain modulation (CPM; previously termed diffuse 
noxious inhibitory controls or DNIC), which refers to a reduction in perceived pain intensity 
for a test stimulus during application of a conditioning stimulus to a remote area of the body 
[44]. Impaired CPM predicts chronic post-operative pain when assessed in pain-free 
individuals prior to surgery [55], highlighting its potential utility as a biomarker of risk for 
chronic pain. Diminished CPM (relative to control samples) has been observed in a variety 
of chronic pain conditions, including fibromyalgia [19,22], temporomandibular disorder 
[17], and chronic headache [32]. Impaired CPM has also been found in adults with IBS 
[14,17,31,51] and is linked to greater distress and discomfort in these individuals [15].
Few evoked pain studies have been conducted in healthy youth [4,26,28,34] and only two 
have examined CPM [29,42]. Relatively little is known about experimental pain responses in 
youth with FAP. Lower heat and pressure pain thresholds - but no differences in pain 
tolerance - were found in a large sample of adolescents with IBS compared to healthy 
controls [41]. Another study of school-age children found lower temporal summation to both 
thermal and mechanical stimuli in children with recurrent abdominal pain compared to 
healthy controls, but no group differences in abdominal pain sensitivity [57]. Finally, a 
recent study restricted to females found impaired CPM in girls with IBS (n = 22) compared 
to healthy girls (n = 21), with the IBS group showing no change in pain ratings after 
application of the conditioning stimulus [52]. The present study is the first, to our 
knowledge, to compare CPM effects between FAP and pain-free youth in a relatively large 
sample including both genders. Based on findings from predominantly adult samples, we 
hypothesized that FAP youth would exhibit impaired CPM compared to healthy controls.
Method
Participants
FAP Group—Participants included pediatric patients between 11 and 17 years of age who 
presented to the pediatric gastroenterology clinic at a large university-based children's 
hospital for their initial evaluation for abdominal pain. Pediatric patients were considered 
eligible for this study if they reported recurrent abdominal pain for at least the past two 
months and could read and write in English at or above sixth grade level. Exclusion criteria

 included: (1) presence of chronic disease (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes); and 
(2) hospitalization within the month prior to study enrollment. FAP patients were recruited 
as part of a larger, questionnaire-based study and a subset elected to complete the laboratory 
pain testing (n = 68). Through an examination of medical records from the clinic evaluation, 
one patient was excluded due to a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease. Four youth 
asked to discontinue the laboratory pain testing protocol and did not complete the CPM 
procedures. Thus, the final FAP sample was comprised of 63 youth.
Healthy controls—Controls (n = 77) were between 10 and 17 years of age and were 
recruited from a primary care clinic at a large university-based children's hospital and from 
the university's research recruitment website. As for the FAP group, the participants were 
required to read and write in English at sixth grade level or above. Exclusion criteria were as 
follows: chronic pain (defined as daily clinical pain ≥ three months in duration), use of 
prescription opioid analgesics, use of antidepressant or antianxiety medications, and learning 
difficulties requiring full-time special education services.
Additional exclusion criteria for both groups included sunburn or painful dermatological 
conditions at the time of the laboratory assessment and pregnancy. Study procedures were 
approved by the Institutional Review Board. All subjects and their parents provided written 
informed assent and consent, respectively, prior to beginning study procedures.
Measures
Demographic Information—Participants provided information on age, sex and race by 
self-report. Only youth with FAP completed sections A and B of the Questionnaire on 
Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms (QPGS-RIII) [47]. These sections of the QPGS-RIII 
assess pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders, specifically IBS and functional 
dyspepsia.
Somatic symptoms—The Children's Somatization Inventory - revised form (CSI) [45] 
was used to determine the perceived severity of somatic symptoms (e.g., headache, 
dizziness, nausea, back pain) in the past two weeks. All participants reported how much they 
were bothered by 24 somatic symptoms on a 5-point scale ranging from “not at all” (0) to “a 
whole lot” (4). Items were summed and total scores ranged between 0 and 96 (higher scores 
indicate greater perceived somatic symptom severity). In this sample, coefficient alpha for 
the CSI was .93.
Functional disability—The Functional Disability Inventory (FDI) [7,46] was used to 
determine the perceived impact of general physical health on psychosocial and physical 
functioning. All participants reported the degree of difficulty they would have performing 10 
specific activities due to their physical health on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 to 4. Items 
were summed and total scores ranged between 0 and 60 (higher scores indicate greater 
functional disability). In this sample, coefficient alpha for the FDI was .92.

 Evoked Pain Testing Procedures
The CPM procedure is described in Figure 1. FAP youth were instructed not to take any pain 
medications within 4 hours of their laboratory visit. The `test stimulus' for the CPM thermal 
pain protocol was a thermal pain stimulus delivered by a thermode (30 × 30 mm) applied to 
the ventral forearm of the participant's non-dominant arm and administered via a 
computerized Medoc TSA-II Neurosensory Analyzer using commercially available software 
(TPS-CoVAS version 3.19, Medoc Inc., Ramat Yishay, Israel). As in previously published 
work [29], the `conditioning stimulus' for the CPM protocol was a Boekel General Purpose 
Water Bath (Boekel Scientific, Feasterville, PA) maintained at a steady temperature of 
46.5°C in accordance with previously-established guidelines [55]. Perceived pain intensity 
was rated by participants on a 0 to 100 scale (0 = “no pain” and 100 = “worst imaginable 
pain”). Participants were trained in the use of the perceived pain intensity rating scale at the 
beginning of the pain protocol by providing examples of different pain stimuli; their 
understanding of the scale was checked through sample questions and during orientation to 
the pain testing equipment.
For each participant, the thermode temperature eliciting a pain rating between 50 and 70 was 
determined first (hereafter referred to as “P-60”). To determine the P-60 temperature, the 
thermode was applied to the non-dominant ventral forearm in sequences of 15 second pulses 
at 45 °C, 46 °C, and 47 °C, and at additional lower or higher temperatures as warranted until 
the P-60 was identified; thus, participants varied in the number of trials required to 
determine the P-60 temperature. Then, the thermode was moved to a non-overlapping 
location on the non-dominant ventral forearm, and the pre-conditioning test period was 
begun. The forearm thermal test stimulus was applied at the P-60 temperature continuously 
for a 30-second period, with three pre-conditioning pain ratings obtained at 10-second 
intervals. Next, participants took a 10-minute break from the pain testing protocol to 
complete height and weight measurements and to rest. After the break, participants began 
the conditioning portion of the protocol by immersing their dominant hand in the hot water 
bath (conditioning stimulus) for 60 seconds. During this immersion, participants provided 
three water bath pain ratings at 0, 10 and 20 seconds. At 30 seconds, the forearm thermal 
test stimulus was again applied at the P-60 temperature continuously for a 30-second period, 
with three conditioning pain ratings obtained at 40, 50 and 60 seconds.
Data Analytic Plan
Group differences in mean conditioning pain ratings controlling for mean pre-conditioning 
pain ratings (i.e., baseline corrected change) were examined using analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) in SPSS 22 for Windows (SPSS Inc. Headquarters, Chicago, Illinois, USA). For 
this analyses, the assumption of homogeneity of regression slopes was met. Recent evidence 
of mean differences in CPM between girls with and without IBS (d = 0.71) suggests that a 
minimum of 53 adolescents per group would be necessary to detect CPM effects [52]. Based 
on evidence of individual differences in pain rating changes across conditioning trials during 
CPM procedures [29], we examined within-individual changes in pain ratings from the mean 
pre-conditioning rating across the three conditioning trials. A multilevel model (MLM) was 
specified using hierarchical linear models (HLM 6) [37] consisting of a within-person (i.e., 
level-1) sub-model describing how each individual's pain ratings changed over successive

 trials, and a between-person (i.e., level-2) sub-model describing how these changes varied 
across individuals [5,39].
The Level 1 model was as follows:
The Level 2 model was as follows:
In this equation, Painti indicates the numerical pain rating (0 to 100) at trial t for person i, 
Trial denotes the pain rating (mean pre-conditioning, conditioning 1–3), and FAP denotes 
healthy controls (0) or functional abdominal pain (1). Of primary interest was the interaction 
between FAP and trial (β11). Significant interactions were probed, and simple slopes were 
calculated using Preacher and colleagues' online calculator.34 Demographic covariates (race, 
sex, age) were included as predictors of baseline pain ratings. The race X trial interaction 
(β12) was controlled for, based on evidence of racial differences in CPM in healthy youth 
[29]. Preliminary analyses examined potential sex and age differences in CPM effects (i.e., 
the sex X trial and age X trial interactions) and tested whether CPM effects were associated 
with somatic symptom severity and/or functional disability. Normality assumptions were 
checked using a Q-Q plot of residuals. Exploratory analyses examined the distribution of 
CPM effects in FAP and healthy youth based on prior work suggesting significant variability 
in the strength and direction of these effects [52,56]. Three FAP youth were taking selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors at the time of their laboratory visit; removing them from 
analyses did not significantly alter any results.
Results
Descriptive statistics regarding demographic and pain responses for FAP and healthy youth 
are presented in Table 1. The groups did not differ significantly on age or sex. The FAP 
group included a higher percentage of Caucasians than healthy youth. Within the FAP group, 
a significant proportion met criteria for a pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorder: 
IBS (n = 39), functional dyspepsia (n = 4), IBS and functional dyspepsia (n = 3). Compared 
to the healthy group, the FAP group reported higher levels of somatic symptoms and 
functional disability.
Preliminary MLM analyses revealed a significant within-individual decline across the three 
pre-conditioning pain ratings (b = −4.0, SE = 0.96, p < .001); however, FAP and healthy 
youth did not differ in the rate of pre-conditioning decline (b = 0.64, SE = 1.44, p = .659). 
Both the somatic symptom severity (CSI score) X trial (b = 1.30, SE = 0.53, p = .014) and 
functional disability X trial (b = 1.40, SE = 0.53, p = .009) interactions were significant: 
individuals with weaker CPM effects reported greater somatic symptom severity and

 functional disability. Neither the age X trial (b = 0.08, SE = 0.27, p = .782) nor the sex X 
trial (b = −0.63, SE = 1.04, p = .543) interactions were significant; that is, neither age nor 
sex influenced within-person changes in thermode pain ratings. Nevertheless, older youth 
had higher mean pre-conditioning thermode pain ratings (b = 2.54, SE = 0.95, p = .009).
There were no significant group differences in P-60 temperature (48.6°C for both FAP and 
healthy youth), mean pre-conditioning pain rating, or in the first CPM trial rating. However, 
FAP youth reported significantly higher pain ratings in the second and third CPM trials 
compared to healthy youth. Although there were no significant group differences in the first 
and second water bath pain ratings, FAP youth reported significantly higher water bath pain 
ratings on the third trial. Consistent with lower CPM-related pain inhibition in the FAP 
group compared to healthy youth, ANCOVA showed that the FAP group had significantly 
higher mean conditioning thermode pain ratings after controlling for mean pre-conditioning 
thermode pain ratings [F(1,129) = 16.1, p < .001, η2 = .11].
FAP and CPM effects
MLM analyses examined whether FAP influenced within-person changes in thermode pain 
ratings from mean pre-conditioning rating across the three conditioning trials, controlling for 
the race X trial interaction. The FAP X trial interaction was significant (b = 3.69, SE = 1.08, 
p = .001) (Table 2, Figure 2). Simple slope analyses revealed that thermode pain ratings 
declined more slowly for FAP youth (b = −4.19, SE = 1.15, p < .001) than for healthy youth 
(b = −7.79, SE = 0.83, p < .001). Thus, CPM effects consistent with activation of descending 
inhibitory mechanisms were observed to some degree in both groups, but were elicited more 
strongly and rapidly for healthy youth. The race X trial interaction was significant (b = 2.30, 
SE = 1.10, p = .037) and revealed weaker CPM effects in Caucasian compared to non-
Caucasian youth.
Distribution of CPM groups
Exploratory analyses examined the distribution of CPM effects within FAP and healthy 
youth. Overall, pain inhibition and pain facilitation were differentially distributed between 
FAP and healthy youth (χ2 = 8.56, p = .003). The percentage change from mean pre-
conditioning to mean conditioning thermode pain ratings was −19% in healthy youth 
(indicating pain inhibition) and +4% in FAP youth (indicating pain facilitation) (Figure 3). 
The median CPM effect in the FAP group was 0%, with 27 youth (43%) showing mean 
thermode pain rating increases from the pre-conditioning to the conditioning phase. Higher 
mean thermode pain ratings during conditioning than during pre-conditioning were observed 
in a smaller proportion of healthy youth (19%).
Discussion
Youth with FAP often exhibit functional impairment at school (absences, poor academic 
performance) and at home (less involvement in family activities) and are at increased risk for 
developing functional gastrointestinal disorders and psychiatric conditions [1,36,48]. The 
emergence of FAP is likely determined by complex interactions among social, 
environmental, psychological, biological and genetic factors [23]. The present study

 investigated one potential pathophysiological factor that has received relatively little 
attention in youth: altered function in pain modulatory systems. Specifically, we focused on 
CPM, an evoked pain response measure believed to reflect descending pain inhibitory 
function. Results revealed impaired CPM in FAP youth of both genders compared to healthy 
youth, which complements evidence of impaired CPM in adults with IBS [14,17,31,51] and 
extends recent evidence of impaired CPM in girls with IBS [52]. Impaired CPM was 
associated with both greater somatic symptom severity and functional disability. Of note, 
individuals suffering from organic abdominal pain conditions such as Crohn's disease, 
oesophagitis or peptic ulcers exhibit intact CPM [3,9,27]. Thus, impaired CPM appears to 
accompany functional – but not organic – abdominal pain. These findings add to a growing 
literature highlighting the potential utility of impaired CPM as a shared vulnerability 
mechanism across a variety of chronic pain conditions [17,10,22,32].
The median CPM reduction in healthy youth was 19%, which is similar to the 23% 
reduction reported by another study of healthy children and adolescents [42] but somewhat 
lower than the 29% reduction reported by a review of studies conducted in healthy adults 
[34]. These developmental differences are consistent with prior research suggesting that 
CPM effects strengthen from childhood to adolescence [42] but begin to weaken by middle 
age [10,21,38,50]. Strikingly, 43% of FAP youth showed a pro-nociceptive pattern – or pain 
facilitating pain - reflected in mean pain rating increases from the pre-conditioning to 
conditioning phase. Previous studies have described this counterintuitive pattern of results as 
either “pain facilitation” [52] or “less efficient CPM” [56]; the mechanisms that contribute to 
CPM-related sensitization require greater elucidation. Variability in both the strength and 
direction of CPM effects coupled with evidence of within-person changes in test stimulus 
pain ratings during the 30-second hot water bath immersion support the use of multilevel 
modeling over mean pain ratings derived from multiple test stimuli administrations. The 
latter can mask changes in CPM during the conditioning phase, which have previously been 
reported in healthy adults and adults with chronic fatigue syndrome using a variety of test 
and conditioning stimuli [16,25,43].
CPM effects in the present study could not be explained by demographic factors or other 
features of evoked pain responses. Despite higher rates of many functional gastrointestinal 
disorders in females [6] and evidence of enhanced temporal summation to second pain 
(TSSP) in women with a history of FAP compared to men [8], we did not find evidence of 
sex differences in CPM nor have other studies conducted in healthy youth [42]. Racial 
differences in CPM have been found in youth [29] and adults [35]; CPM differences 
between FAP and healthy youth in the present study remained even after controlling for the 
race X trial interaction. The pattern of weaker CPM effects in FAP youth is remarkable 
given that FAP and healthy youth had virtually identical mean pre-conditioning pain ratings 
(58.2 and 59.8, respectively) and P60 temperatures (46.8°C and 46.8°C, respectively). Prior 
work by our group has shown that a `high pain dysfunctional' profile in pediatric FAP 
patients, defined in part by greater perceived pain threat, lower perceived coping efficacy, 
elevated pain catastrophizing and negative affect, was associated with enhanced temporal 
summation of pain at follow-up 9 years later [48]. Future studies should determine whether 
impaired CPM similarly distinguishes individuals with high pain dysfunctional profiles from 
other FAP patient subgroups, and if impaired CPM may even precede and predict FAP onset.

 Growing evidence of impaired CPM in chronic pain conditions has prompted investigation 
into the plasticity of pain modulation. Patients with osteoarthritis exhibit impaired CPM but 
show a normalization of pressure pain modulation following surgical pain relief [20]. CPM 
efficiency may influence treatment outcome: patients with painful diabetic neuropathy and 
impaired CPM report greater efficacy of duloxetine than patients with intact CPM and also 
show stronger CPM effects following treatment [56]. CPM effects could be mediated, in 
part, by endogenous opioid release: administering the opioid antagonist naloxone appears to 
dampen functional connectivity between the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and regions 
implicated in descending pain control during a CPM task [40]. To our knowledge, no studies 
have yet examined whether psychotherapeutic interventions for FAP enhance CPM 
efficiency or if targeting impaired CPM can reduce risk for FAP onset.
Limitations of the present study provide directions for future research. First, we did not 
evaluate visceral sensitivity, which is more directly relevant to the clinical presentation of 
FAP in youth [49]. Examining relations between visceral sensitivity and CPM represents an 
important avenue for future research. Second, the pain testing protocol was only partially in 
line with recent recommendations for CPM assessment due to our reliance on one type of 
test stimulus [54]. Replication of findings across other test stimuli is critical given recent 
meta-analytic evidence that relations between psychosocial factors and CPM differ 
according to the pain modality [30]. Third, this study was cross-sectional; prospective 
studies are needed to determine whether impaired CPM is a risk factor for FAP. Fourth, we 
did not evaluate the impact of expectancies – which may influence CPM effects [12] - prior 
to the experimental protocol.
Despite these limitations, the current study adds FAP to a growing list of chronic pain 
conditions characterized by impaired endogenous pain inhibition [17,19,22,32]. That CPM 
effects – but not mean pre-conditioning pain ratings or P60 temperature – differentiated FAP 
from healthy youth provides further support for the importance of dynamic pain assessment 
modalities. Prospective evidence has shown that CPM efficiency – but not static pain 
assessments such as pain threshold - predict subsequent onset of chronic pain [55]. Youth 
with FAP exhibited heterogeneity in their responses to the CPM assessment and nearly half 
showed a counterintuitive increase in pain ratings during the conditioning phase; the 
mechanisms underlying this pattern of `pain facilitating pain' should be investigated as well 
as its potential clinical and prognostic relevance. Understanding whether impaired pain 
inhibition influences the onset and course of FAP - and if CPM can be modified - is critical 
given the enormous toll of FAP on the individual and society.
