address freshwater constraints in India: a modelling study

Summary
Background The availability of freshwater for irrigation in the Indian agricultural sector is expected to decline over the 
coming decades. This might have implications for food production in India, with subsequent effects on diets and 
health. We identify realistic and healthy dietary changes that could enhance the resilience of the Indian food system 
to future decreases in water availability.
Methods In this modelling study, we optimised typical dietary patterns in an Indian population sample to meet 
projected decreases in the availability of water per person for irrigation (blue water footprint) due to population 
growth (to 2025 and 2050). The optimised diets met nutritional guidelines and minimised deviation from existing 
patterns. Resulting changes in life-years lost due to coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancers were 
modelled using life tables, and changes in greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of diets were 
estimated. The primary outcomes of the model were changes in life-years per 100 000 total population over 40 years 
(to 2050).
Findings The optimised diets had up to 30% lower blue water footprints and generally contained lower amounts of 
wheat, dairy, and poultry, and increased amounts of legumes. In the 2050 scenario, adoption of these diets would on 
average result in 6800 life-years gained per 100 000 total population (95% CI 1600–13 100) over 40 years. The dietary 
changes were accompanied by reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The magnitude of the health and 
environmental effects varied between dietary patterns.
Interpretation Modest changes in diets could help to address projected reductions in the availability of freshwater for 
irrigation in India. These dietary changes could also simultaneously reduce diet-related greenhouse gas emissions 
and improve diet-related health outcomes.

Introduction
In many parts of the world, groundwater resources are 
being depleted faster than they can be replenished, with 
some of the highest rates of depletion in areas of high 
agricultural productivity.1 In India, the proportion of 
available freshwater used for agricultural production 
might already be unsustainably high,2 and water 
availability per person is projected to decline substantially 
over the coming decades.3 The potential effects of 
freshwater shortages on India’s ability to produce an 
adequate quantity and quality of food for its population 
are significant not least because India already has a large 
double burden of malnutrition. Although prevalence of 
undernutrition remains high, problems because of 
overweight and obesity are increasing, especially in 
wealthier, urban populations.4 India faces a growing 
challenge to shape a food system that is resilient to 
the combined effects of dietary and epidemiological 
transitions, population growth, and environmental 
change. One potential solution to support India’s food 
system tackle falling groundwater resources might be to 
modify existing dietary patterns.
A number of previous studies have quantified the 
health and environmental effects of population-level 
dietary modifications, commonly with the intention of 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions.5 Most previous 
work in this area has considered shifts in consumption 
of broad food groups, such as meat, and recently more 
advanced methods have been used to optimise dietary 
patterns to achieve health and greenhouse gas reduction 
targets.6 A broad consensus has emerged, typically from 
studies in high-income countries, that moderating 
consumption of animal-source foods and increasing 
consumption of fruits and vegetables, can reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions and has the cobenefit of 
improving population health.
Few studies have attempted to derive optimised diets 
that reduce water use in their production, and to our 
knowledge, no assessment of the potential effects of such 
optimised diets on health has been done.7 Here, we 
investigate the resilience of the Indian food system to 
future changes in the availability of groundwater for 
agricultural irrigation. Specifically, we optimise typical 
dietary patterns in India to limit agricultural groundwater

use in line with projected reductions in groundwater 
availability per person and assess the associated effects 
on greenhouse gas emissions and diet-related health in 
adults. We focus on ground and surface freshwater used 
for irrigation (blue water footprints) because irrigation is 
crucial to food production in India and the depletion of 
groundwater in food-producing regions is of concern.2,3
Methods
Scenarios of future water availability
The Ministry of Water Resources estimates the current 
national annual average volume of available water in 
India at 1869 billion cubic metres (BCM).3 Accounting 
for hydrological and topological constraints, only 
1123 BCM is considered to be useable.3 Current demand 
for irrigation is estimated to be 557 BCM per year,3 
representing 49·6% of the total useable water. Due to 
projected growth in population, by 2050, demand for 
irrigation is expected to increase to more than 70% of 
usable water unless production technologies or diets 
change.3
We modelled changes to Indian dietary patterns 
under two time scenarios, accounting for population 
growth, that would maintain total water used for 
irrigation (blue water footprint) at the current level 
(557 BCM per year) by reducing water levels per person. 
Scenario one (the 2025 scenario): with projected popu-
lation growth from 1·15 billion (2010) to 1·40 billion in 
2025, water per person will be reduced by 18·0%.3 
Scenario two (the 2050 scenario): with the population 
projected to reach 1·64 billion by 2050, water per person 
will be reduced by 30·3% compared with 2010.3 We 
accordingly reduced the average blue water footprints of 
Indian dietary patterns per person by 18·0% and 30·3% 
for the 2025 and 2050 scenarios, respectively.
Dietary patterns and associated environmental effects
Our dietary patterns were based on the Indian Migration 
Study (IMS), a large and diverse cross-sectional survey 
of adult factory-employed urban migrants in Bangalore, 
Hyderabad, Lucknow, and Nagpur and their rural 
siblings (n=7067) from 2005 to 2007
.8 Dietary intake was 
assessed using a semiquantitative food frequency 
question 
naire. We grouped IMS food items into 36 food 
groups based on compositional similarity and derived 
baseline average consumption (g/capita per day) for 
five distinct dietary patterns using finite mixture 
modelling. Briefly, the patterns were rice and low 
diversity—a rice-based pattern with low consumption of 
other food groups and relatively low total dietary energy; 
rice and fruit—a diet characterised by high consumption 
of rice and fruits; wheat and pulses—a diet containing 
higher than average levels of wheat, pulses, legumes, 
and vegetables but lower than average consumption of 
fruits; wheat, rice, and oils—a mixed pattern containing 
both wheat and rice and with the highest total dietary 
energy; and rice and meat—a rice-based pattern with 
greater than average consumption of meat and fish. Full 
details of the method and baseline dietary patterns are 
reported elsewhere.9
We linked each food group to data for blue water 
footprints and greenhouse gas emissions. The blue water 
footprint of crops represents the amount of water sourced 
from surface or groundwater resources used for irrigation 
during agricultural production.10 The blue water footprint 
of livestock products represents the water used to irrigate 
feed ingredients, and drinking and service water.11 Water 
footprint values were derived from the Water Footprint 
Network.10–12 The greenhouse gas emissions associated 
with agricultural production of crop and livestock products 
were estimated using the Cool Farm Tool based on 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We conducted informal searches of published literature and 
reports by relevant organisations and were unable to identify 
estimates of the environmental impacts of typical Indian dietary 
patterns. We have estimated and previously reported mixed 
environmental impacts of Indian diets and agricultural 
production—per person diet-related greenhouse gas emissions are 
low compared with western diets, but agriculture-related water 
use is high. National estimates suggest that per person availability 
of freshwater for agricultural irrigation is projected to fall in 
coming decades and some areas of India already have declining 
groundwater levels. To our knowledge, this study is the first to 
investigate the potential role of dietary modification as a solution 
to the increasing pressures on freshwater availability for 
agriculture in the coming decades.
Added value of this study
Optimisation modelling using India-specific food consumption 
and environmental data suggests that relatively minor dietary 
modifications could enable India to reduce per person 
freshwater requirements associated with irrigation in agriculture 
to 2025; larger changes to diets would be required to meet 
freshwater reduction targets to 2050. Our modelling 
demonstrates that the optimised diets that meet WHO 
nutritional guidelines would also deliver the co-benefits of 
reduced diet-related greenhouse gas emissions and improved 
population health.
Implications of all the available evidence
The Indian food system is likely to face increasing pressure 
throughout the 21st century to deliver healthy and nutritious 
diets as the population increases and groundwater availability 
declines. Agricultural improvements and technologies will 
contribute to meeting these challenges but dietary 
modifications that reduce the environmental impacts of 
Indian diets could also make substantial contributions to 
mitigation efforts.

farm-level activity data.13,14 Emissions associated with food 
processing, transport, preparation, and waste were based 
on previous scientific literature.15 Detailed methods used to 
calculate water footprints and greenhouse gas emissions 
of IMS diets can be found in the appendix and elsewhere.12,14
Dietary modelling
We optimised each dietary pattern to derive new diets 
that reduced blue water use to meet the 2025 and 
2050 targets on average across the five dietary patterns 
and achieved WHO nutritional guidelines for carbo-
hydrates, fats, free sugars, protein, sodium, fruits, and 
vegetables (appendix)15 with no change in total dietary 
energy. The optimisation process minimised deviation 
from existing dietary patterns (deviation was calculated 
as the sum of squared percentage changes between 
baseline and optimised consumption in each food 
group; the percentage changes were squared to account 
for both increased and decreased consumption levels). 
To achieve the overall blue water use reduction across 
all dietary patterns, equitable targets for each of the 
five patterns were defined accounting for their baseline 
blue water footprints (ie, greater levels of reduction per 
person were required for dietary patterns with higher 
baseline footprints). In each scenario, the method 
converged blue water use per person on the same level 
for each dietary pattern, though with different con-
tributions from each.
As a simplified measure of consumer preferences, 
each food group was weighted by the ratio of its share of 
dietary expenditure to its price elasticity (appendix) using 
published data for expenditure16 and price elasticities.17
The optimisations were done with R statistical software 
using the Alabama package, which uses an augmented 
Lagrangian method with an adaptive barrier function to 
optimise non-linear functions including constraints 
(the modelled constraints were requirements to reduce 
the diet’s blue water footprint, to meet nutritional 
guidelines, and to maintain dietary energy). The output 
was a set of optimised dietary patterns with new levels of 
consumption for each food group.
Modelling the health effects
We estimated the effect on mortality due to immediate 
adoption of each optimised dietary pattern using a life 
table method adapted from the IOMLIFET model coded 
in R.18 The model was set up using mortality and 
population data from the Indian Registrar General, the 
UN, and WHO, projected to 2050 by extrapolation of 
recent trends using second order polynomials.19–22
Guided by evidence from the Global Burden of Disease 
study23 and a previous review of meta-analyses,6 we 
assessed the effect of changes in consumption of red meat 
(largely mutton in the Indian setting), fruits, and 
vegetables on the following outcomes: coronary heart 
disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and cancers of the mouth, 
pharynx or larynx, oesophagus, lung, stomach, and colon 
or rectum. Exposure-response functions were assumed to 
be log-linear and, where multiple exposures affected a 
single outcome, risks were assumed to be multiplicative. 
S-shaped curves (cumu 
lative distribution functions of 
normally dis 
tributed variables), based on evidence on the 
effects of dietary interventions on mortality over time, 
were used to account for time lags in disease after dietary 
changes. The primary outcomes of the model were 
changes in life-years per 100 000 total population over 
40 years (to 2050). Further details of the health impact 
model can be found in the appendix and previous reports.24
Statistical analysis
We used a Monte Carlo simulation method with 
1000 repetitions to obtain a measure of the variability 
associated with our estimates of optimised dietary changes 
and associated environmental and health effects. For each 
repetition, we sampled randomly from the distribution of 
input parameters, assuming normal distributions. For 
baseline consumption of each food group in each dietary 
pattern, we used the SDs of individual-level consumption 
for survey participants assigned to that pattern. For water 
footprints, variations were based on spatial differences 
reflecting state-level blue water footprints. For expenditure, 
estimates were based on the SEs of the survey data, and 
for exposure-response coefficients, we used 95% CIs from 
the original published sources. Where we were unable 
to obtain full information (nutritional composition, 
greenhouse gas emissions, and price elasticities), we 
assumed uniform distributions of plus or minus 10% 
around the central estimates. To reduce the likelihood of 
locating local minima, within each simulation, the 
optimisation was performed 20 times and the best result 
(minimum objective value while meeting all constraints) 
was selected.

and low diversity) to 877 L/day (wheat, rice, and oils) 
and dietary greenhouse gas emissions ranged from 
1·93 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (kgCO₂e)/
day (wheat and pulses) to 3·33 kgCO₂e/day (rice and 
meat; table 1). The optimised diets achieved the 2025 and 
2050 blue water footprint reduction targets of 18·0% 
and 30·3%, respectively, across all patterns (table 2). 
These optimised diets generally featured increased 
consumption of fruits and vegetables and small 
increases from low baseline levels in mutton and other 
red meat consumption. Although the optimised diets 
remained distinct, common trends in the changes 
required to reduce overall blue water footprints were 
noted: large decreases in the amount of foods with the 
highest blue water footprints including wheat, dairy, 
eggs, poultry, nuts, and seeds; large increases in legumes 
(including red gram), which despite their relatively high 
blue water footprints are a good vegetable source of 
protein; switching from white meat (poultry) to mutton 
and other red meat with lower blue water footprints 
(largely due to the relatively lower water footprints of 
feed); and switching from fruits such as grapes, guava, 
and mango to those that have lower blue water footprints 
such as melon, orange, and papaya. Full details of the 
optimised diets can be found in the appendix.
The total amount of water used for irrigation (557 BCM 
per year) remained unchanged after optimisation but, 
because of population growth, the per person blue water 
footprints of the diets were reduced (figure 1). The mean 
per person reductions were largest for wheat-based diets 
with high baseline levels: up to 38·5% (95% CI 36·0–40·6) 
in the wheat and pulses pattern and 41·7% (39·4–43·9) in 
the wheat, rice, and oils pattern by 2050 (table 2). Conversely, 
the blue water footprint of the rice and low diversity pattern 
increased slightly in the 2025 scenario (to achieve the 
overall reduction across all dietary patterns) but decreased 
for the more stringent 2050 target (9·2%, 95% CI 3·4–14·7). 
The rice and fruit and rice and meat patterns were in the 
mid range of water footprint reductions.
The changes in dietary patterns following optimisation 
were accompanied by reductions in dietary greenhouse gas 
emissions. There were particularly large greenhouse gas 
reductions in the wheat and pulses pattern of up to 36·2% 
(95% CI 19·4–49·1) by 2050, due to large declines in dairy 
products. Changes in dietary green

the other patterns were smaller. No simulations in 
the Monte Carlo analysis showed increased emissions 
(appendix).
If these optimised diets were to be adopted within our 
studied Indian population, our model suggests that this 
would be broadly beneficial for health. Estimated health 
impacts under the two scenarios were relatively similar 
(figure 2, 3). Generally, the low blue water footprint diets 
would provide benefits for coronary heart disease, 
stroke, and cancer, of which the largest benefits would 
be for coronary heart disease. However, because of the 
switch from white meat to mutton and other red meat 
(especially in the rice and meat pattern), there would be 
some increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes.
In four of the five patterns, after optimisation the 
mean effect combined across all health outcomes 
would be positive (appendix). For example, under the 
2050 scenario, the net effect across all patterns was 
6800 life-years gained per 100 000 population (95% CI 
1600–13 100) over the 40-year follow-up period (rounded 
to the nearest hundred). The health benefits were largest 
in the rice and low diversity (13 500, 10 200–16 800) and 
wheat, rice, and oils (11 400, 800–26 300) patterns. The 
exception was the rice and fruit pattern that contained 
high levels of fruit consumption at baseline; reduced 
fruit consumption in the rice and fruit pattern would 
lead to increased risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, 
and some cancers, especially when vegetable con-
sumption was also reduced in the 2050 scenario, 
resulting in 2800 life-years lost per 100 000 population 
(–1500 to –6300) over 40 years.
The Monte Carlo analysis shows that some combinations 
of variability in the input parameters can result in overall 
adverse effects on health (figures 2, 3; appendix). However, 
broadly speaking, our results suggest that consumption of 
low blue water footprint diets would improve health in the 
study population.
Discussion
We show that modest changes to dietary patterns could 
reduce irrigation water requirements per person in a 
geographically diverse Indian sample and that these 
changes would also reduce diet-related greenhouse gas 
emissions and improve population health. These 
multiple benefits highlight the importance of dietary 
change as a means to tackle planetary health challenges. 
The broader picture is, however, more complex as some 
required dietary changes by 2050 would be relatively 
large (figure 1); some are contrary to current trends in 
diets; and some might have adverse effects on population 
health and nutrient intake (appendix).
Our study is theoretical and the results should be viewed 
as indicative. Our scenarios were based on projections of 
population growth only and did not account for other 
potential drivers with more complex and uncertain effects, 
such as climate change and aquifer depletion. We also did 
not account for non-food crop production, current dietary 
trends, temporal variation in water availability, or the

demand in India vary substantially, with some predicting 
supply to fall to only 50% of demand by 2030,25 although 
the estimates used for our scenarios are broadly consistent 
with others.26
Our dietary patterns were derived from a large and 
diverse population sample, but are not nationally 
representative. In particular, the IMS over-represents 
wealthier, urban dwellers relative to India as a whole and 
the sample does not include children. Our analysis also 
did not account fully for regional variations in water 
footprints, although these were included im 
plicitly in the 
distributions of blue water footprints used as input to the 
model. Additionally, we could not distinguish between 
renewable and non-renewable ground 
water or consider 
effects on green (rainfall) water use. Under climate 
change, rainfall is likely to become increasingly 
unpredictable in India,27 providing additional rationale 
for ensuring sustainable ground and surface water use. 
We also did not account for the potential effects of poor 
water quality on availability for irrigation,28 nor the 
additional strain on water resources from the need to 
produce more and diverse foods for malnourished 
population groups. There are also un 
certainties in our 
estimation of health effects as we assumed instantaneous 
adoption of the optimised diets and we only included a 
limited number of health outcomes to avoid potential 
double counting and confounded associations.
Studies on modification of diets to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions and improve health are increasing,5 but 
few previous studies have attempted to optimise diets to 
reduce water use. A multi-objective method used to 
optimise diets in Italy found that a sustainable diet 
(integrating environmental and eco 
nomic sustainability) 
used the least water.7 To date, studies have used only 
stochastic methods to examine uncertainties. To our 
knowledge, this study is the first of its type to combine 
dietary optimisation with an assess 
ment of potential 
variability, albeit with simplifying assumptions because 
of data limitations, and we provide an indication of the 
scale of probable variability in our estimates. An 
improved understanding of uncertainties is key for 
designing appropriate policies and interventions; our 
Monte Carlo simulations identified some potential 
adverse effects on health that would not have been 
captured by standard deterministic methods.
Future research on the nature and implications of 
sustainable and healthy diets will need to account for 
changing consumption trends, including transitions to 
more energy-dense and processed foods, that will have 
consequences for health, water availability, greenhouse 
gas emissions, and land use.4 The effect of environmental

uncertain and likely to vary regionally, must also be 
better understood.29 In India, for example, monsoon 
precipitation, which is projected to become more variable 
in the future as a result of climate change, has been 
shown to affect groundwater storage but with large 
geographical differences.30 From a policy perspective, our 
study focused only on demand-side solutions: realistic 
changes in a set of typical dietary consumption patterns. 
Policy action to tackle the effects of reduced water 
availability on food production could also exploit a range 
of supply-side opportunities that remain largely un-
explored, including improved agronomic and irrigation 
technologies, taxation, and international trade (including 
food imports). 
Despite these tensions and potential trade-offs, this 
study shows that, at least over coming decades, Indian 
dietary patterns could be modified in line with projected 
per person reductions in water availability in a way that 
protects the environment and enhances the health of the 
population. These changes could play an important part 
in the development of a resilient food system in India.
