Abstract
Background—Transcaval access may enable fully percutaneous transcatheter aortic valve 
replacement (TAVR) without the hazards and discomfort of transthoracic (transapical or 
transaortic) access.
Objectives—We performed a prospective, independently-adjudicated, multi-center, single-arm 
Investigational Device Exemption trial of transcaval access for TAVR in patients ineligible for 
femoral artery access and high or prohibitive risk of complications from transthoracic access.
Methods—100 subjects underwent attempted percutaneous transcaval access to the abdominal 
aorta by electrifying a caval guidewire and advancing into a prepositioned aortic snare. After 
exchanging for a rigid guidewire, conventional TAVR was performed through transcaval 
introducer sheaths. Transcaval access ports were closed with nitinol cardiac occluders. A core lab

 analyzed pre-discharge and 30-day abdominal CT. The STS predicted risk of mortality was 9.6 
± 6.3%.
Results—Transcaval access was successful in 99/100 subjects. Device success (access and 
closure with a nitinol cardiac occluder without death or emergency surgical rescue) was 98/99, 
except for one closed only with a covered stent. Inpatient survival was 96% and 30-day survival 
was 92%. VARC2 life-threatening bleeding and modified VARC2 major vascular complications 
possibly related to transcaval access were 7% and 13%, respectively. Median length of stay was 4 
(2–6) days. There were no vascular complications after discharge.
Conclusion—Transcaval access enabled TAVR in patients who were not good candidates for 
transthoracic access. Bleeding and vascular complications, using permeable nitinol cardiac 
occluders to close the access ports, were common but acceptable in this high risk cohort. 
Transcaval access should be investigated in patients who are eligible for transthoracic access. 
Purpose-built closure devices are in development that may simplify the procedure and reduce 
bleeding.

Introduction
Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVR) avoids the morbidity and mortality of 
surgical aortic valve replacement in high and intermediate risk patients (1–6). Transthoracic 
(transapical and transaortic) access is inferior compared with femoral-artery access (6), 
perhaps in part because of the clinical features precluding femoral artery access. Discomfort 
and morbidity are more pronounced from transthoracic access for TAVR, probably because 
of invasiveness and pulmonary insults. An alternative transfemoral access approach to TAVR 
might be desirable in these patients to reduce the hazards and discomfort of transthoracic 
access and because of the superior operator ergonomics.
We developed a technique of transfemoral venous access for retrograde TAVR by entering 
the abdominal aorta through the adjoining inferior vena cava, which is now called transcaval 
access (7) (Central Illustration). Animals tolerate the resulting acute aorto-caval fistula even 
without repair, because the retroperitoneal space appears to pressurize and cause aortic blood 
to return immediately through the corresponding hole in the vena cava (Figure 2). Patients 
tolerate transcaval access after implanting nitinol cardiac occluders to close the aortic port. 
Transcaval access and closure was uniformly successful in the first 19 patients, all of whom 
had no good TAVR access options (8).
We have refined the technique of transcaval access and closure (9) and tested the early multi-
center experience in a single-arm prospective Investigational Device Exemption trial in 
patients deemed to have high or prohibitive risk of complications from transthoracic access 
for TAVR. This paper describes 30-day outcomes in 100 patients.

 Methods
Patients and study design
The study evaluated success and complications of transcaval TAVR access and closure with 
a nitinol cardiac occluder device. It was designed as a prospective open-label multi-center 
single-arm study with on-site monitoring, independent endpoint adjudication, and central 
core laboratory analysis of follow-up images (NCT02280824).
Subjects were eligible to participate if (1) they had severe symptomatic native aortic valve 
stenosis or bioprosthetic aortic valve failure for which TAVR was indicated, (2) extreme risk 
or inoperability for conventional femoral artery, trans-apical, or trans-aortic access as 
determined by the institutional multi-disciplinary heart team, and (3) anatomic suitability for 
transcaval access according to a baseline CT scan analyzed by the NHLBI core laboratory. 
These are further detailed in the Online Appendix. Screening details on ineligible candidates 
were not collected.
The US Food and Drug Administration granted Investigational Device Exemption for this 
sponsor-investigator study, which had Institutional Research Boards approval from all 20 
participating sites and NHLBI. All subjects consented in writing. The NHLBI Data Safety 
Monitoring Board provided oversight, and pre-specified endpoints were independently 
adjudicated by Medstar Heart and Vascular Institute Clinical Events Committee. Sites 
received on-site proctorship by the principal investigator and/or sponsor.
The IDE was sponsored by the senior author on behalf of NHLBI, which was the data 
coordination center. Sites participated without NHLBI funding. The manufacturer of the IDE 
test article (Amplatzer nitinol occluder devices, St Jude Medical) allowed FDA to cross-
reference the device master file for the IDE but did not otherwise participate in the study. 
Subjects were concurrently enrolled into the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American 
College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapies (TVT) registry(10).
Technique of transcaval access and closure
The technique has been detailed previously (8,9). Briefly, the procedure is planned from the 
baseline TAVR CT (11,12) to identify a calcium-free target on the right aortic wall that 
allows safe passage of the TAVR sheath from the inferior vena cava to the abdominal aorta. 
The trajectory of the sheath should be free of interposed obstacles (bowel) and the area of 
aortic entry should be away from important arterial branches allowing for provisional 
covered stent bailout if necessary. After heparin anticoagulation, a loop snare was placed in 
the aorta to serve as a target. A coaxial crossing system consisting of a 0.014″x300cm 
coronary guidewire (Confienza Pro 12 or Astato XS20, Asahi, Abbott) inside a 
0.035″x145cm locking wire convertor (Piggyback, Vascular Solutions), inside a braided 
0.035″x90cm microcatheter, inside a 6–7Fr renal-length IMA or RDC1 guiding catheter 
(Figure 3), was positioned into the cava, aimed towards the aortic snare, and electrified using 
a monopolar electrosurgery pencil at 50W during brief guidewire advancement across 
vascular walls. Once the 0.014″ guidewire was snared, counter-traction allowed the wire 
convertor and 0.035″ microcatheter to be advanced successively across the aortic wall and 
then exchanged for a rigid 0.035″x260cm guidewire (Lunderquist, Cook). The TAVR

 introducer sheath — Retroflex 3 or eSheath(13) (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine CA) or extra-
large Check-Flo (Cook, Bloomington IN) for Edwards Sapien valves, or large Check-Flo 
18Fr × 40cm (Cook) for Medtronic Corevalve — was then introduced from the femoral vein 
into the aortic lumen over the rigid guidewire. Predilatation with a non-compliant coronary 
dilatation balloon (2–3mm × 20cm) was performed when necessary to advance the 
microcatheter. Retrograde TAVR was performed using standard transfemoral technique.
To close the access port after TAVR, heparin anticoagulation was fully reversed with 
protamine, and a nitinol cardiac occluder (Amplatzer Duct Occluder or Amplatzer 
Ventricular Septal Defect Occluder, St Jude Medical) was positioned in the aorta through the 
TAVR introducer sheath alongside a 0.014″ buddy guidewire, rotated sideways using a 
deflectable catheter (Agilis NxT SML curl, St Jude Medical), and deployed along the right 
aortic wall. Pigtail aortic angiography guided occluder device positioning. Aortocaval 
fistulas were accepted unless they caused heart failure from shunting. If retroperitoneal 
bleeding was evident, adjunctive balloon aortic tamponade or self-expanding covered stents 
(typically iliac limb extenders, Endologix or Trivascular, Irvine, CA) were deployed at 
physician discretion. Post-procedure antiplatelet and anticoagulation medications were 
administered according to local routine.
Data analysis
Clinical outcomes were entered into electronic case report forms and independently 
monitored. Follow-up CT scans, contrast enhanced when renal function permitted, were 
obtained before discharge and at 30 days. Angiograms and CT scans were analyzed in 
central NHLBI core laboratories. An independent clinical events adjudication committee 
classified all deaths, bleeding, vascular complication, major adverse cardiovascular events 
and their relatedness to transcaval access and closure according to a modification of 
VARC-2 (14) (Online Appendix). NHLBI has custody of all data; the sponsor and the 
principal investigator are responsible for data integrity.
The primary endpoint was device success, defined as successful transcaval access and 
deployment of a closure device without death or emergency open abdominal surgery. Data 
are reported as mean ± standard deviation or median (25tht, 75th percentile) as appropriate. 
Continuous and integer data were compared using a Student t test or Fisher exact test, 
respectively. To identify predictors of bleeding or vascular complications, we assessed 
association separately for each potential predictor (age, sex, closure device/sheath ratio, 
sheath aorta ratio, aortic diameter, fistula patency, balloon aortic tamponade, covered stent, 
transcaval procedure volume) and each discrete outcome by fitting a proportional-odds 
cumulative-logit model in SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC). Multivariable models were formed using a 
backwards stepwise selection of clinical and procedural factors (excluding those thought to 
be consequents of bleeding) until only factors with p<0.20 remained. Effects of transcaval 
experience were assessed by creating a dichotomous variable indicating the two highest-
enrolling sites.

 Results
Enrollment
100 subjects enrolled and underwent attempted transcaval TAVR at 17 of 20 sites between 
July 2014 and June 2016. 30-day follow-up data were obtained for all. Sites performed a 
median of 2 (0,4) transcaval procedures before this study was initiated.
Procedure Outcomes
Transcaval access and closure was successful in 99/100 attempts. A typical procedure is 
depicted in Figure 4. Baseline characteristics, including predictors of transthoracic access 
complications, are shown in Table 1. Procedure characteristics are shown in Table 2. In one 
subject the guidewire failed to cross, and the operator subsequently performed transfemoral 
artery TAVR complicated by iliac artery rupture. Device success, the primary endpoint of the 
study, was 98/100. This includes the failure to cross and another in whom the operator chose 
primary closure using a covered aortic stent instead of repositioning a fully-withdrawn 
nitinol occluder. All patients survived the immediate TAVR procedure, and none died as a 
direct consequence of transcaval access and closure, nor did any undergo emergency surgical 
rescue of the transcaval access site. Important TAVR complications included one case of 
THV-related coronary obstruction that was ultimately fatal, one case of aortic annular 
hematoma managed conservatively and successfully, no THV embolization, 16 new 
permanent pacemakers, and no case of endocarditis during the 30-day landmark analysis.
Inpatient and one-month follow-up data are shown in Table 3. Four patients died before 
hospital discharge, two each of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular causes. 30-day 
landmark survival was 92%. Seven deaths were adjudicated as cardiovascular, and one as 
non-cardiovascular. Specific causes of death are elaborated in the Online Appendix.
Bleeding and vascular complications are summarized in Table 4. Transcaval-related bleeding 
was adjudicated as VARC2 major or life-threatening in 12/99. Overall 35 patients received a 
median of 2.0 (2.0, 4.0) units of red cell transfusions during their transcaval TAVR 
admission. Transcaval-related vascular complications were adjudicated as modified VARC2 
major in 13/99, typically because of a retroperitoneal hematoma detected on mandatory CT 
scan combined with hemoglobin drop. Covered stents were placed in 8 subjects after 
transcaval access and closure, all but one during the same procedure. The indication was 
ongoing extravasation after deploying the transcaval closure device in the one patient who 
was receiving apixaban during the procedure, intolerable left-to-right shunt in two patients 
manifest as hemodynamic instability and deterioration in right ventricular function, and one 
used for primary closure of the transcaval access site after complete withdrawal of the nitinol 
occluder device. The indications for covered stent placement were less clear in the 
remaining four subjects: one had aortic root hematoma and the operator placed a covered 
aortic stent to reduce diagnostic ambiguity should hemodynamic instability ensue; one had 
unexplained hypotension not improved by covered stent that in retrospect was attributable to 
anesthesia medications; one was taken back to the cath lab in the evening after the transcaval 
procedure for hypotension and evident retroperitoneal hematoma, and a covered stent was 
placed out of caution even though there was no extravasation; and one in whom the operator

 planned a covered stent to treat a preexisting aortic dissection at the transcaval access site. 
Post-hoc multivariate analysis of clinical and procedural characteristics identified predictors 
of bleeding (Online Appendix), including small closure device/sheath diameter ratio, 
baseline hemodialysis, older age, larger aortas, and lower-enrolling sites. Post-hoc predictors 
of vascular complications included larger sheath/aorta diameter ratio, and lower-enrolling 
sites. The aorto-caval fistula was occluded immediately after transcaval TAVR in 36/99 
(36%). Among evaluable mandatory CT scans (Table 5), the fistula was occluded in 38/72 
(53%) upon hospital discharge and 48/66 (72%) at 30-days. Incorporating angiography, 
64/99 (64%) of tracts were occluded by 30 days.
Retroperitoneal hematoma (Table 5) was found by the core lab in 24% of subjects before 
discharge, and in 5% of subjects after 30 days. Most were graded small or moderate. There 
were no vascular complications after discharge.
No patient had a complication related to the transcaval closure device or closure site, nor 
aortic pseudoaneurysm, after hospital discharge.
There were two TAVR-related myocardial infarctions, one of which was fatal. There were 
five TAVR-related ischemic strokes. Three patients developed acute tubular necrosis 
classified as acute kidney index (AKI) scores of 3, including two who required 
hemodialysis. There were no cases of hemolytic anemia, nor of infected nitinol occluder 
device. Five had nadir platelet counts < 50×109/mL, four of whom had a patent aortocaval 
fistula on the final angiogram, and none of whom had evident sequelae.
There were fewer complications in the half of patients treated at centers with more 
transcaval experience, including VARC-2 30-day safety events (17% vs 36%, p=0.03), 
covered stents (6% vs 11%, p=0.32), major or life-threatening bleeding (13% vs 28%, 
p=0.01), major vascular complications (11% vs 28%, p=0.03), and AKI≥1 (7% vs 15%, 
p=0.22), although some differences did not meet statistical significance. There was no 
difference in outcomes between the first and second half of patients enrolled.
Discussion
Transcaval access and closure for TAVR was successful in a cohort of patients without good 
conventional access options. This is remarkable given that most participating centers had 
limited prior transcaval experience, that we employed a permeable closure device, and that 
the patients had extensive comorbidity. The observed 30-day mortality was 8%, although no 
patient died or required surgical bailout as a direct consequence of transcaval access. 
Adjudicated bleeding and vascular complications were common. From a patient-centered 
outcome perspective, the primary observed morbidity, of blood transfusions, compares 
favorably to the morbidity of surgical transthoracic access.
The included patients were not eligible for femoral artery access and were deemed poorly-
suited or ineligible for transthoracic access. 77% received contemporary low-profile THV 
devices. Eligibility for transthoracic access was a subjective clinical determination made by 
the local multidisciplinary heart team including cardiac surgeons. The included patients had 
high STS predicted risk of mortality (9.7 ± 6.3%) and a heavy burden of co-morbidities. We

 speculate that patients with fewer co-morbidities, who might be suitable for transthoracic 
access, might suffer fewer complications from transcaval access.
Despite fears of catastrophic hemorrhage, transcaval access appears well tolerated. We infer 
that the retroperitoneal space surrounding the aortic entry site pressurizes during and after 
closure, and that aortic bleeding decompresses into the nearby venous hole because 
retroperitoneal pressure exceeds venous pressure (Figure 2). In a small number of patients, a 
transiently unrepaired aorto-caval fistula was well tolerated after pull-through of a closure 
device (Figure 5), or during replacement of the introducer sheath or dilator. Even after 
device closure, asymptomatic residual aorto-caval fistulae persisted in two-thirds before 
discharge and one-third after the first month.
Life-threatening (also known as “disabling”) bleeding occurred in 12% of high or 
prohibitive risk patients after transcaval TAVR in this study (mean STS score 9.6), compared 
with 22.6% of intermediate-risk patients after transthoracic TAVR and 6.7% after 
transfemoral TAVR using the Sapien 3 THV in PARTNER-II (mean STS score 5.8)(6). In 
the other major pivotal TAVR trials for which data are available according to type of access, 
non-transfemoral access (transapical or transaortic) was associated with major vascular 
complication rates of 3.8–5.9% and life-threatening or major bleeding rates of 8.7–
22.6%(3,6,15). In large non-adjudicated single center and national TAVR registries, the rate 
of life-threatening and major bleeding with non-transfemoral access ranges from 3.6–37.3%, 
the rate of transfusion ranges from 8.9–25.4% and the rate of major vascular complications 
ranges from 0.6–2.4% (16–21).
Despite a paucity of randomized data on alternate extra-thoracic access such as trans-carotid, 
subclavian or trans-axillary, single center experience suggests these approaches compare 
favorably to transthoracic, with acceptable rates of bleeding and vascular access 
complications (17,22,23). None of these had systematic follow-up imaging or independent 
adjudication. Compared with carotid, subclavian, and axillary artery access, transcaval 
access may provide: (1) superior operator ergonomics, in that the operators work from the 
standard right groin puncture site; (2) less tortuous sheath trajectory; (3) less risk of brachial 
plexus injury; (4) no surgical dissection. That said, all of these extra-thoracic access methods 
appear to work well.
In this study, adjudicators classified transcaval-related vascular and bleeding complications 
according to modified VARC-2 standards (14). Because we obtained CT scans 
systematically before discharge, and because blood transfusions were common (35%), 
VARC-2 classified vascular complications as “major” even when patients had otherwise 
uneventful clinical courses. For example, a patient who had a small retroperitoneal blood 
collection on CT and who had a 2 unit blood transfusion without “an overt source of 
bleeding” would be classified as having major bleeding, yet would have been classified as 
having no bleeding had there not been systematic follow-up imaging.
Covered stents were employed in 8% of subjects, fewer than half for extravasation or 
intolerable shunt through the permeable nitinol occluder devices, and none for catastrophic 
aortic disruption or hemodynamic collapse. Covered stents are considered a “failure” only

 because this study was designed to evaluate the specific permeable nitinol cardiac occluder 
devices in the closure of transcaval access ports. By contrast, in clinical practice a 
provisional strategy of nitinol occluder implantation and bail-out covered stenting seems 
prudent and practical.
Outcomes after transcaval access have improved since the first human experience (8). 
Bleeding and vascular complications have declined because of technique refinements such 
as complete reversal of heparin anticoagulation before closure, consistent implantation of 
slightly oversized closure devices, use of a deflectable sheath to rotate the closure device 
horizontally during deployment, and liberal use of balloon aortic tamponade, even though 
the closure devices have not changed. In this prospective trial, centers with more transcaval 
experience trended toward fewer complications. Outcomes may improve further using a 
purpose-built closure device that is immediately hemostatic.
Limitations of this investigation include the absence of a control group, the inclusion of 
patients without other good options who have expected high morbidity and mortality not 
necessarily reflected in their risk score, the employment of a permeable nitinol occlude 
device, the participation of sites with little or no prior experience, the large proportion (18%) 
of missing follow-up CT, and limited data collection including cost, quality of life, and 
frailty. Some countervailing strengths include independent clinical event adjudication and 
data monitoring, and careful centralized analysis of follow-up CT. Compared with femoral 
artery access, transcaval procedures impart additional logistical complexity of planning, 
crossing, and closure. The extra expense of closure devices may possibly be offset by 
reduced morbidity and length of stay compared with transthoracic access.
Transcaval access may prove valuable for other clinical applications. It has been employed 
successfully as part of thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (24) and to introduce 5.0 L 
percutaneous left ventricular assist devices (Impella, Abiomed) (25). The transcaval 
approach may allow transcatheter implantation of other large devices, for example to treat 
aortic regurgitation.
Conclusion
Transcaval access is a realistic alternative for TAVR. These data support cautious clinical 
adoption in patients without good access options, and comparison against more established 
alternative access routes in lower risk patients. Outcomes and applicability might improve 
with more experience and using a purpose-built, impermeable closure device to achieve 
immediate hemostasis.

 Figure 2. Proposed mechanism of hemodynamic stability after transcaval access using permeable 
nitinol occluder devices
Higher pressure in the relatively confined retroperitoneal space exceeds venous pressure 
(Inset) and causes aortic blood to return to the venous circulation through a nearby hole in 
the IVC (inset). The result is aortocaval fistula rather than hemodynamic collapse. Courtesy

 Figure 4. A representative transcaval TAVR procedure
(A–E) A suitable target (yellow arrow) is identified on CT and displaced in axial (C) 
reconstruction to show crossing point, sagittal reconstruction (D) to show lumbar level, and 
coronal thick-slab projection to simulate fluoroscopy (E). Under fluoroscopy, the 
transvenous crossing catheter is aligned with the aortic snare in a lateral projection (F), and 
the guidewire is electrified during advancement into the aorta (G) and then snared (H) and 
exchanged for a stiff guidewire. The THV sheath is advanced from the femoral vein into the 
aorta (I). After TAVR, a nitinol cardiac occluder device is positioned across the aortic wall 
(J–L). In this case, completion angiography shows complete occlusion of the aorto-caval 
fistula (M). Predischarge CT (N–O) shows the device in position with a small retroperitoneal 
hematoma and an occluded tract.

 Figure 5. Unconstrained aorto-caval shunt after inadvertent pull-through of a closure device
A: This angiogram was performed while preparing a new closure device. The blood pressure 
was not changed. The arrow points to the unrepaired aorto-caval fistula. B: A fistula persists 
on the completion angiogram after a closure device was implanted. C–D: On pre-discharge 
CT, there is no retroperitoneal hematoma, and the fistula is reduced but persistent. It is 
occluded on follow-up CT (E–F)

 Central Illustration. Transcaval access technique
Transcaval access is obtained over an electrified guidewire directed from the IVC towards a 
snare in the abdominal aorta (A). After delivering a microcatheter to exchange for a stiff 
guidewire (B), the transcatheter heart valve introducer sheath is advanced from the femoral 
vein into the abdominal aorta for conventional transfemoral retrograde TAVR (C). The aorto-
caval access site is closed with a nitinol cardiac occluder (D). Courtesy of A Hoofring, NIH 
Medical Arts Branch.
