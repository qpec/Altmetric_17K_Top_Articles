Abstract
Objectives—We sought to evaluate the association of physical activity with chronic myocardial 
damage, assessed by elevated high sensitivity troponin T (hs-cTnT), in individuals with and 
without obesity.
Background—Physical activity is associated with reduced heart failure (HF) risk, particularly 
among individuals with obesity. The role of chronic myocardial damage in this association is 
uncertain.
Methods—We studied 9,427 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study 
without cardiovascular disease, with body-mass index >18.5 kg/m2. Physical activity was 
categorized per AHA guidelines as: recommended, intermediate, or poor. We evaluated cross-
sectional associations of physical activity and obesity with elevated hs-cTnT (≥14 ng/L). In 
prospective analyses, we quantified the association of elevated hs-cTnT with HF risk within cross-
categories of baseline physical activity and obesity.

 Results—Persons with poor physical activity were more likely to have elevated hs-cTnT than 
those with recommended (OR 1.39; 95% CI: 1.15–1.68). In cross-categories of physical activity 
and obesity, using the non-obese/recommended activity group as the reference, persons with 
obesity and poor activity were most likely to have elevated hs-cTnT (OR 2.46; 95% CI: 1.91–
3.19), whereas the obese/recommended activity group had a weaker association (OR 1.68; 95% 
CI: 1.28–2.21; p<0.001 for interaction between physical activity and obesity). In prospective 
analyses, elevated hs-cTnT was strongly associated (p<0.001) with incident HF in all obesity/
physical activity cross-categories (p>0.2 for interaction).
Conclusions—Physical activity is inversely associated with chronic subclinical myocardial 
damage. Physical activity may lessen the association between obesity and subclinical myocardial 
damage, which could represent a mechanism by which physical activity reduces HF risk.

Introduction
Physical activity is widely appreciated as a key component of strategies to reduce heart 
failure (HF) risk (1). Physical activity has been linked to a lower likelihood of HF among 
individuals with obesity, a group at particularly elevated HF risk (2,3). Notably, the reduced 
HF risk associated with physical activity among individuals with obesity is not fully 
explained by traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), suggesting the 
protective association of physical activity against HF may be partially mediated through 
non-traditional mechanisms.
Obesity has potent associations with abnormalities of myocardial structure and function and 
subsequent HF (4) via unclear pathways (5). An increasingly appreciated risk factor for the 
development of HF is subclinical myocardial damage, as reflected by levels of cardiac 
troponin T measured using novel high sensitivity assays (hs-cTnT) (6,7). Indeed, among 
individuals without prior CVD, obesity has been independently linked to elevated hs-cTnT 
levels, and the combination of obesity and elevated hs-cTnT is associated with markedly 
increased HF risk (8). It is presently unknown whether higher physical activity is associated 
with lower levels of subclinical myocardial damage in the presence or absence of obesity. 
Decreased myocardial damage could represent a pathway by which physical activity is 
related to lower HF risk.
We therefore tested the hypothesis that physical activity has an inverse association with 
elevated hs-cTnT in a community based population of men and women without clinical 
CVD, and that higher physical activity lessens the association between obesity and 
subclinical myocardial damage. To evaluate the clinical importance of these associations, we 
also assessed the link between elevated hs-cTnT and subsequent HF risk within groups 
defined by physical activity and obesity status.

 Methods
Study Population
The Atherosclerosis Risk in Community (ARIC) Study is a multicenter, prospective, 
observational cohort investigation of CVD and related conditions in middle-aged men and 
women. The study design has been previously described (9). Briefly, a total of 15,792 
individuals aged 45–64 years, were enrolled between 1987 and 1989 from 4 US 
communities. Participants were examined at baseline, at three subsequent visits occurring 
approximately every three years, and at a fifth visit conducted from 2011–2013. Physical 
activity was assessed in all participants at Visit 3 (1993–1995), whereas measurements of hs-
cTnT were obtained for all participants at Visit 4 (1996–1998). We therefore performed non-
concurrent cross-sectional analyses evaluating the associations of physical activity and 
obesity status at Visit 3 with prevalent hs-cTnT levels at Visit 4. In prospective analyses, we 
additionally assessed the risk of incident HF associated with elevated hs-cTnT within cross-
categories of physical activity and obesity.
Of 12,887 individuals who attended Visit 3, 9,427 were eligible for this study. We excluded 
individuals who were missing data on physical activity or BMI at Visit 3 (n=40) or hs-cTnT 
at Visit 4 (n=1,796), those with self-reported CVD, a CVD clinical event (HF or coronary 
heart disease, including coronary revascularization procedures), or silent myocardial 
infarction at or prior to Visit 4 (n=1,492), those not of black or white race (n=38) and those 
with a BMI <18.5 kg/m2 (n=94). All participants provided informed consent, and the study 
protocol was approved by the institutional review boards at each study site. Measurement of 
Study Variables
The primary exposure was physical activity, measured through a modified Baecke 
questionnaire (10) at Visit 3 (1993–1995). The questionnaire asked questions on 
participation in up to 4 sports or exercise physical activity within the previous year and the 
number of hours/week and months/year spent on each sport. As has been done in prior 
ARIC analyses (11,12), we converted the Baecke sports indices into minutes per week of 
moderate or vigorous exercise. Each activity was converted into metabolic equivalents of 
task (METS) based on the Compendium of Physical Activities. Moderate activities were 
defined as those involving a workload of 3–6 METS and vigorous activities were those 
involving a workload of >6 METS. We subsequently categorized physical activity according 
to the AHA guidelines as “recommended” (≥75 min/wk of vigorous intensity or ≥150 
min/wk of any combination of moderate + vigorous intensity), “intermediate” (1–74 min/wk 
of vigorous intensity or 1–149 min/wk of any combination of moderate + vigorous 
intensity), or “poor” (0 min/wk of moderate or vigorous exercise) (13). We also modeled 
physical activity as a continuous variable in METS*min/wk and used this continuous 
variable to generate quartiles of physical activity.
Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from measured height and weight at Visit 3 and 
categorized as non-obese (BMI 18.5 to < 30 kg/m2) and obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2). 
Information on additional covariates of interest was obtained through history, physical exam 
and laboratory data at Visit 3. Smoking status was categorized as current and non-current 
smoker, and alcohol consumption quantified in grams per week. Diabetes was defined as

 fasting glucose ge;126mg/dL, non-fasting glucose 200mg/dL, self-reported history of 
diabetes, or use of hypoglycemic agents. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured three 
times and the mean of the second and third measurements was used for analyses.
Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured 
using standardized enzymatic assays. Renal function was assessed using estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated based on serum creatinine at Visit 4 using the 
Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation (14). N-terminal 
pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) 
were measured from plasma collected at Visit 4, and frozen at −80° C.
The primary outcome in cross-sectional analyses was elevated hs-cTnT, defined as a level 
ge;14ng/L, a cut point that has been used in several prior analyses (6,7). Hs-cTnT levels 
were measured in 2011 from Visit 4 plasma samples that had been stored at −80oC, using a 
high sensitivity assay (Elecsys troponin T, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). As 
previously reported, the reliability coefficient for hs-cTnT measurements among the ARIC 
study participants was 0.94 (15). The between-assay coefficient of variation for control 
materials was 6.9% for mean hs-cTnT concentrations of 29 ng/l.
Incident Heart Failure
In prospective analyses, the outcome of interest was incident HF, defined as the first 
hospitalization or death related to HF. HF deaths were identified by hospital discharge codes 
and death certificates, with ICD-9 code 428 being used to identify hospitalizations and 
deaths early in follow up, and ICD-10 code I-50 for HF deaths in later follow-up. 
Information on hospitalizations was obtained from participants via yearly telephone calls, 
and vital records were examined for all deaths. HF events occurring from 2005 onwards 
were additionally adjudicated by an expert panel (16).
Statistical Analysis
We used multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate the adjusted associations of 
physical activity categories with myocardial damage, as assessed by elevated hs-cTnT. We 
used the highest (”recommended”) physical activity category (individuals performing ≥75 
min/wk of vigorous intensity or ≥150 min/wk of any combination of moderate + vigorous 
intensity exercise physical activity) as the reference group. We constructed two models, one 
with confounders and a second one also including potential mediators of the effects of 
physical activity on subclinical myocardial damage. Model 1 included age, sex, race, 
smoking status, and alcohol intake. Model 2 included all variables from Model 1 as well as 
SBP, anti-hypertensive medication use, diabetes mellitus, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, 
and triglycerides. We constructed a third adjustment model that included the variables in 
Model 2 as well as additional predictors of future HF such as heart rate, eGFR, NT-proBNP, 
and hsCRP. Covariates were selected a-priori, based on previously published data and known 
risk factors for HF. We conducted sensitivity analyses with physical activity modeled as 
quartiles. We additionally evaluated the continuous association of physical activity (in 
(MET*minute)/week) with elevated hs-cTnT by scaling per 1-SD and constructing restricted

 cubic spline models. We tested for multiplicative interactions with age (≥ or < 65 years), 
race and gender on the association between physical activity and hs-cTnT.
To evaluate the association between physical activity and hs-cTnT in the presence and 
absence of obesity, we conducted analyses stratified by obesity status (non-obese and obese), 
using regression models including the same covariates outlined above. We also created 
cross-categories of physical activity (recommended, intermediate, poor) and obesity status 
(non-obese, obese) to assess the combined association of these two exposure variables with 
elevated hs-cTnT, using a common reference group of non-obese individuals with 
recommended physical activity. We performed additional analyses using abdominal obesity, 
defined by World Health Organization criteria as a waist circumference of ≥ 88 cm for 
women and ≥ 102 cm for men, as an alternative measure of adiposity.
In prospective analyses, the baseline was ARIC visit 4 (the time point of hs-cTnT 
measurement) with follow up for incident HF through December 31st, 2012. We constructed 
Poisson and Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusting for covariates at Visit 3, 
to estimate the adjusted incidence rates and hazard ratios with associated 95% confidence 
intervals for incident HF within each cross-category of physical activity and obesity. To 
evaluate the clinical implications of the associations of physical activity and obesity with 
elevated hs-cTnT, we then constructed regression models to estimate the incidence rates and 
hazard ratios for HF associated with elevated hs-cTnT within each of the cross-categories of 
physical activity and obesity status. We created an interaction term and performed likelihood 
ratio tests to test for heterogeneity in the associations between elevated hs-cTnT and incident 
HF across the cross-categories.
Statistical analyses were performed with Stata version 13.1. All p-values presented are 2-
sided.
Results
Characteristics of the study population according to physical activity categories are 
presented in Table 1. Physical activity categories were fairly evenly distributed across the 
study population, with 43% of individuals reporting recommended, 23% intermediate, and 
34% poor levels of physical activity. Among those with and without obesity, 33% and 47%, 
respectively, performed recommended levels of physical activity. Compared to those with 
recommended physical activity, participants with lower levels of physical activity were more 
likely to be women, African-Americans, current smokers, had higher SBP, prevalence of 
diabetes and BMI. Lower physical activity was also associated with lower HDL-cholesterol 
levels, and higher heart rate, eGFR and hsCRP. There were no significant differences in NT-
proBNP levels across categories of physical activity.
Within the study population, 7.2% of individuals had elevated hs-cTnT levels. The 
prevalence of elevated hs-cTnT increased with lower physical activity levels, being found 
among 6.8%, 7.0%, and 7.7% of individuals with recommended, intermediate, and poor 
activity, respectively.

 In logistic regression analyses, lower categories of physical activity were associated with 
significantly higher odds of subclinical myocardial damage. Relative to those with 
recommended physical activity, persons with poor physical activity were more likely to have 
elevated hs-cTnT (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.15–1.68) after adjusting for confounders (Table 2, 
Model 1). Notably, a significant inverse association between physical activity and elevated 
hs-cTnT remained after additional adjustment for several potential CVD mediators (OR 
1.31; 95% CI: 1.08–1.59) (Table 2, Model 2). We noted similar trends, however of only 
borderline statistical significance after additional adjustment for heart rate, eGFR, NT-
proBNP and hsCRP (OR 1.21; 95% CI: 0.99–1.49) (Table 2, Model 3). When physical 
activity was modeled continuously, its association with elevated hs-cTnT remained 
significant (p=0.02). In analyses modeling physical activity as quartiles, we observed a 
significant association between lower physical activity quartiles and a higher likelihood of 
myocardial damage (Figure 1, Panel A). A graded association between lower levels of 
physical activity and higher odds of subclinical myocardial damage was also demonstrated 
in restricted cubic spline models (Figure 1, Panel B). Results were similar across age, race 
and gender subgroups, with no significant interaction between physical activity and these 
demographic variables on the outcome of elevated hs-cTnT.
We found similar results in analyses stratified by obesity status. A significant, inverse, 
relationship was observed between physical activity modeled continuously and elevated hs-
cTnT among both obese (p=0.01) and non-obese (p=0.02) participants. Each 1-SD lower 
physical activity level (781 (MET*min)/week) was significantly associated with a higher 
likelihood of elevated hs-cTnT, in persons who were obese (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.05–1.42) 
and non-obese (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02–1.27).
In analyses evaluating the association of cross-categories of physical activity and obesity 
status with elevated hs-cTnT after adjusting for confounders (Table 3, Model 1), using the 
non-obese and recommended activity group as the reference, we found that persons in the 
obese and poor physical activity group were most likely to have elevated hs-cTnT (OR 2.46; 
95% CI: 1.91–3.19). However, the combination of obesity and recommended physical 
activity levels had a weaker association with elevated hs-cTnT (OR 1.68; 95% CI: 1.28–
2.21). After further adjustment for CVD mediators (Table 3, Model 2), the combination of 
obesity and recommended physical activity levels was no longer significantly associated 
with elevated hs-cTnT (OR 1.20; 95% CI: 0.90–1.61). Similar trends were noted after 
additional adjustment for heart rate, eGFR, NT-proBNP, and hsCRP (Table 3, Model 3). 
Notably, a statistically significant interaction between physical activity and obesity on the 
outcomes of hs-cTnT was seen in all models. Analogous patterns were seen when waist 
circumference, categorized using World Health Organization criteria for abdominal obesity, 
was used as an alternative metric for adiposity (Supplemental Table 1).
In prospective analyses, we evaluated the association between elevated hs-cTnT and 
subsequent HF risk within each cross-category of physical activity and obesity status. Over a 
median 15 years of follow-up, there were 1,178 HF events in the study population. As shown 
in Supplemental Table 2, the adjusted incidence rates for HF (per thousand person years) 
were lowest in the subgroup that were non-obese with recommended activity (5.75), while 
the highest rates were seen in the obese/poor activity subgroup (14.09). A similar pattern

 was seen in Cox regression analyses (Supplemental Figure 1), with the highest HF risk 
among the cross-categories seen for those with obesity and poor activity (HR 2.55, 95% CI: 
2.14–3.04).
Within each cross-category of physical activity and obesity status, the presence of elevated 
hs-cTnT was strongly associated with higher incidence rates for HF relative to non-elevated 
hs-cTnT (Figure 2). Analogously, in multivariable Cox regression analyses, elevated hs-
cTnT was strongly associated with significantly increased HF risk compared to non-elevated 
hs-cTnT within each obesity-physical activity cross-category (Supplemental Table 3). A 
test for an interaction in the association between elevated hs-cTnT and incident HF across 
the cross-categories was not significant (p for interaction =0.21). Among those with obesity 
and poor physical activity, the subgroup with the highest likelihood of myocardial damage, 
elevated hs-cTnT was associated with a 3-fold higher risk of HF compared to non-elevated 
hs-cTnT (HR 3.19; 95% CI: 2.28–4.47).
Discussion
In this analysis of a bi-racial community-based sample of men and women without a history 
of CVD at baseline, we found that physical activity was inversely associated with chronic 
subclinical myocardial damage, as assessed by elevated hs-cTnT levels. This association was 
seen among individuals with and without obesity. Findings were consistent across 
demographic subgroups. When examining cross-categories of physical activity and obesity 
status, those with recommended physical activity and without obesity had the lowest 
likelihood of subclinical myocardial damage, while those with poor activity and obesity 
were most likely to have myocardial damage. Importantly, our results also suggest that 
recommended physical activity levels may lessen the association between obesity and 
myocardial damage. Furthermore, the presence of subclinical myocardial damage was 
significantly and similarly associated with incident HF within each cross-category of 
physical activity and obesity. The protective association of physical activity against 
subclinical myocardial damage may have implications for HF risk reduction, particularly 
among the high-risk group of individuals with excess weight.
Subclinical myocardial damage, as reflected by hs-cTnT is increasingly appreciated as a 
potent risk factor for the development of HF (6,7). In prior work, obesity has been linked to 
elevated hs-cTnT, and those individuals with both obesity and elevated hs-cTnT had a 9-fold 
higher risk of future HF than individuals with normal weight and undetectable hs-cTnT (8). 
While a prior study in an elderly population demonstrated an association between greater 
physical activity and lower hs-cTnT levels (17), there are limited data regarding how 
combinations of physical activity and obesity influence the likelihood of subclinical 
myocardial damage. Our study extends prior work by showing a graded inverse association 
between physical activity and hs-cTnT in a population that includes both middle-aged and 
elderly adults in the general community. Furthermore, we found a statistically significant 
interaction between physical activity and obesity on myocardial damage, indicating that this 
protective association may be stronger among individuals with obesity, a group at 
particularly high-risk for future HF.

 In the current study, the association between higher physical activity and a lower likelihood 
of elevated hs-cTnT was seen even after accounting traditional CVD mediators but 
attenuated after adjustment additional predictors of HF including hsCRP. This suggests the 
associations of physical inactivity with myocardial damage may be related to pathways 
beyond the effects of physical activity on risk factor levels, which might include decreased 
inflammation (18). The mechanisms by which physical activity may lead to lower 
myocardial damage are incompletely understood. Laboratory studies have shown 
modulatory effects of physical activity on several myocellular defense mechanisms, with 
improved cardiac antioxidant capacity and mitochondrial respiratory function, ultimately 
leading to improved myocardial tolerance to noxious stimuli (19,20). Physical activity also 
has favorable effects on cardiac structure and function (21). Further investigation will be 
needed to understand whether these and other pathways mediate the association between 
physical inactivity and myocardial damage.
Clinical Implications
Our study has several important clinical implications. Given the high morbidity and 
mortality associated with HF, as well as its growing prevalence, there is an emerging focus 
on the early detection of high risk individuals such as those with obesity, who would most 
benefit from targeted prevention strategies (13). Given prior data demonstrating a potent 
association between obesity and incident HF that is unlikely to be addressed by solely 
controlling adiposity-associated cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes 
and dyslipidemia (22), promoting increased physical activity may be a particularly important 
strategy for HF risk reduction among individuals with obesity.
Additionally, a dose-response relationship between physical activity and myocardial damage 
was observed, with those individuals with AHA recommended levels of physical activity 
having lower likelihood of elevated hs-cTnT than those with poor physical activity. 
However, only 43% of the study population performed guideline-recommended levels of 
physical activity, and this number was even lower among individuals with obesity (33%). 
Given the strong association of subclinical myocardial damage with incident HF, further 
studies should explore whether hs-cTnT might be used as a marker of cardiovascular health 
in association with changes in physical activity. This could be particularly relevant among 
individuals with obesity, a group known to have higher levels of subclinical myocardial 
damage and increased HF risk.
Our study does have certain limitations. Usual physical activity levels were assessed using a 
questionnaire at a single point in time. Self-reported activity levels are likely associated with 
some misclassification and may not fully capture the cumulative effect of regular physical 
activity on myocardial damage. Furthermore, we did not have information on fitness in the 
ARIC study. Hs-cTnT was measured from stored blood samples and degradation over time 
may have modestly affected the absolute values of hs-cTnT; however, given the high 
correlations observed in prior validity studies (15), relative measures of association should 
remain unbiased. The non-concurrence of physical activity and hs-cTnT measurements is 
also a limitation and we cannot establish temporality of the observed associations of 
physical activity with myocardial damage in this study. As with all observational studies, we

 cannot exclude the presence of residual confounding. Additionally, we cannot exclude 
possible false positive findings resulting from multiple testing in our multivariable analyses. 
Nonetheless, our findings within a large, well-characterized, community based bi-racial 
cohort offer new insights regarding the inter-relationship of physical activity and obesity 
with myocardial damage that are likely broadly generalizable.
In summary, among middle-aged and older adults without a history of clinical CVD, 
physical activity was inversely associated with subclinical myocardial damage. Additionally, 
higher physical activity may lessen the association between obesity and subclinical 
myocardial damage. These results may have important implications for HF prevention, 
particularly in persons with obesity.

 Clinical Perspectives
Obesity and subclinical myocardial damage are important risk factors for heart failure. 
Physical activity is associated with lower risk of heart failure among non-obese and obese 
individuals, through unknown mechanisms. In this analysis of ARIC, we found that 
physical activity was inversely associated with subclinical myocardial damage. 
Additionally, higher physical activity may lessen the association between obesity and 
subclinical myocardial damage. Given the strong association of hs-cTnT and heart 
failure, the current study supports promotion of physical activity as a key strategy for 
heart failure prevention, particularly among high-risk subgroups such as persons with 
obesity.

 Translational Outlook
Physical activity was inversely associated with subclinical myocardial damage among 
non- obese and obese individuals, which could represent a mechanism by which physical 
activity reduces heart failure risk. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms 
underlying the association of physical activity and heart failure.
