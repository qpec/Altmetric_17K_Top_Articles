Abstract
Background—HIV infected (HIV+) individuals may be more susceptible to alcohol-related 
harm than uninfected individuals.
Methods—We analyzed data on HIV+ and uninfected individuals in the Veterans Aging Cohort 
Study (VACS) with an Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption AUDIT-C score 
from 2008–2012. We used Cox proportional hazards models to examine the association between 
alcohol exposure and mortality through July, 2014; and linear regression models to assess the 
association between alcohol exposure and physiologic injury based on VACS Index Scores. 
Models were adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, smoking, and Hepatitis C infection.
Results—The sample included 18,145 HIV+ and 42,228 uninfected individuals. Among HIV+ 
individuals, 76% had undetectable HIV-1 RNA (<500 copies/ml). The threshold for an association 
of alcohol use with mortality and physiologic injury differed by HIV status. Among HIV+

 individuals, AUDIT-C score ≥4 (hazard ratio [HR] 1.25, 95% CI 1.09–1.44) and ≥30 drinks per 
month (HR, 1.30, 95% CI 1.14–1.50) were associated with increased risk of mortality. Among 
uninfected individuals, AUDIT-C score ≥5 (HR, 1.19, 95% CI 1.07–1.32) and ≥70 drinks per 
month (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.00–1.28) were associated with increased risk. Similarly, AUDIT-C 
threshold scores of 5–7 were associated with physiologic injury among HIV+ individuals (beta 
0.47, 95% CI 0.22, 0.73) and a score of 8 or more was associated with injury in uninfected (beta 
0.29, 95% CI 0.16, 0.42) individuals.
Conclusions—Despite antiretroviral therapy, HIV+ individuals experienced increased mortality 
and physiologic injury at lower levels of alcohol use compared with uninfected individuals. 
Alcohol consumption limits should be lower among HIV+ individuals.

1. INTRODUCTION
The health impact of alcohol use is well described (Dawson et al., 2008; Rehm et al., 2003; 
Saitz, 2005). While the impact of alcohol on cause-specific mortality can vary by condition, 
most large observational studies demonstrate a dose-dependent association between higher 
levels of alcohol consumption and all-cause mortality (Di Castelnuovo et al., 2006; Harris et 
al., 2010; Knott et al., 2015; Plunk et al., 2014; Rogers et al., 2015). However, alcohol use is 
common among those with HIV infection (HIV+ individuals) and may be uniquely harmful 
in this population (Braithwaite and Bryant, 2010; Braithwaite et al., 2008, 2005; Cook et al., 
2001). Among other effects, alcohol use is associated with poor adherence to life preserving 
combination antiretroviral treatment (ART; Braithwaite and Bryant, 2010; Braithwaite et al., 
2008, 2005; Cook et al., 2001; Samet et al., 2004) and increases risk for liver fibrosis (Lim 
et al., 2014), a leading cause of death. Further, compared with uninfected individuals, HIV+ 
individuals report fewer drinks required to experience intoxication (McGinnis et al., 2015). 
As a result, some have suggested that “safe limits” for alcohol use among those with HIV 
infection should be lower than among uninfected individuals (Samet et al., 2007, 2004).
Further, health effects of alcohol among HIV+ individuals appear to vary depending on 
whether viral suppression is attained. Given a unit dose of alcohol, HIV+ individuals 
experience higher blood alcohol concentrations before, compared to after, initiating ART 
(McCance-Katz et al., 2012). In addition, having a detectable HIV viral load is associated 
with a lower number of drinks to feel intoxicated among HIV+ individuals (McGinnis et al., 
2015). Since many the prior studies were dominated by HIV+ individuals who had not 
achieved viral suppression, it is important to determine whether differential harms from 
alcohol use persist among a more current sample of HIV+ individuals, most of whom have 
achieved HIV-1 RNA suppression on ART, compared with uninfected individuals.
Finally, all-cause mortality is an important health outcome, but it is not the only one of 
interest (Kinder et al., 2009). HIV+ individuals in care are aging (Justice, 2010) and 
experiencing increasing physiologic injury resulting in cumulative frailty or a greater 
vulnerability to stressors (Clegg et al., 2013). The Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS)

 Index incorporates weighted values of routinely available clinical biomarkers including age, 
CD4 count, HIV-1 RNA, hemoglobin, platelets, aspartate transaminase, alanine 
transaminase, creatinine, and Hepatitis C sero-status (Justice et al., 2013; Tate et al., 2013). 
The Index provides reliable estimates of five-year mortality in HIV + individuals (Tate et 
al., 2013) and has been shown to predict hospitalization (Akgun et al., 2013a), physical and 
cognitive performance (Marquine et al., 2014; Oursler et al., 2013), and fragility fractures 
(Womack et al., 2013). The Index also predicts hospitalization and mortality among 
uninfected individuals (Akgun et al., 2013a). As a result, the VACS Index is a clinically 
applicable measure of overall physiologic injury and may be a meaningful indicator of 
frailty (Akgun et al., 2013a; Escota et al., 2014; Shaper, 1990; Shaper and Wannamethee, 
1998; Womack et al., 2013). The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test - Consumption 
(AUDIT-C) is a commonly used tool to screen for alcohol use in large clinical populations 
(Bradley et al., 2007). We use mortality, the VACS Index, and self-reported alcohol data, to 
compare health outcomes associated with patterns of alcohol use among HIV+ and 
uninfected individuals. Our first aim is to determine whether level of alcohol use is 
associated with all-cause mortality and physiologic injury as measured by the VACS Index. 
Our second aim is to determine whether AUDIT-C thresholds for physiologic injury differ 
by HIV status.
2. METHODS
2.1 Data
We used data from the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS), a large electronic medical 
record (EMR) based cohort study of 47,805 HIV + and 99,061 uninfected patients receiving 
care in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) from fiscal years 1997 to 2014 
(Conigliaro et al., 2004; Justice et al., 2006a, 2006b). We identified those who reported 
alcohol use based on having a non-zero AUDIT-C score after enrollment into the cohort and 
from October, 2008 to March, 2012. Observations with an AUDIT-C score of zero were 
excluded since those who abstain from alcohol may be an inappropriate referent group 
(Knott et al., 2015) as they often include individuals who became abstinent due to 
comorbidities and other health issues (Fillmore et al., 2007; Shaper, 1990; Shaper and 
Wannamethee, 1998). We elected not to use alcohol-related diagnoses from the EMR for the 
current analysis due to concerns over low sensitivity (Kim et al., 2012; Quan et al., 2008). 
Women were excluded because they represent less than 3% of VACS subjects and 
sensitivity to the effects of alcohol varies by gender (Midanik, 1999).
2.2 Main Outcomes
Outcomes included: 1) all-cause mortality and 2) physiologic injury as measured by the 
VACS Index. Mortality rates were calculated using follow-up time starting with date of first 
AUDIT-C and ending with date of death or July 31, 2014, whichever came first. Deaths 
were identified from four sources: 1) the Patient Treatment File, which records hospital 
deaths in the VHA healthcare system, 2) the Beneficiary Identification Records Locating 
System, which tracks VHA death benefits, 3) the Medicare Vital Status File, and 4) the 
Social Security National Death Index. The VACS Index was calculated as previously 
reported using laboratory values from closest to (±90 days) date of AUDIT-C measurement.

 Of note, VACS Index is calculated for uninfected individuals by assuming a normal CD4 
count (i.e., greater than 500 cells/mm3) and an undetectable HIV-1 RNA VL (Akgun et al., 
2013a; Akgun et al., 2013b).
2.3 Main Predictor
Alcohol exposure was assessed based on self-reported responses to the AUDIT-C. AUDIT-
C data are collected nationally in the VHA using automated clinical reminders in the EMR 
that providers must complete on their patients on a regular basis (Bradley et al., 2006). For 
each of the 3 questions in the AUDIT-C, 0–4 points are assigned based on the response and 
summed for a total score ranging from 0–12. Item 1 is: “How often do you have a drink 
containing alcohol?” Choices (points) include: never (0), monthly or less (1), 2–4 times a 
month (2), 2–3 times a week (3); or 4 or more times a week (4). Item 2 is: “How many 
standard drinks containing alcohol do you have on a typical day?” Choices (points) include: 
0 (0), 1 or 2 (0); 3 or 4 (1); 5 or 6 (2); 7 to 9 (3); 10 or more (4). The original AUDIT-C Item 
2 had no option for 0 number of drinks; therefore, we combined the responses of 0 and 1 or 
2. Item 3 is: “How often do you have six or more drinks on one occasion?” Choices (points) 
include: never (0); less than monthly (1); monthly (2); weekly (3); daily or almost daily (4).
AUDIT-C has been evaluated using multiple cutoffs including 3+, 4+, and 5+ (Bradley et 
al., 2007; Bush et al., 1998; Gordon et al., 2001; Gual et al., 2002). Heavy episodic drinking 
(HED) has been assessed using a cutoff based on any positive response to AUDIT-C item 3 
(McGinnis et al., 2013). Further, recommended cutoffs for AUDIT-C vary based on the 
population (male vs. female, 65 years), the different modes in which the AUDIT-C is asked 
(face to face vs. confidential survey), and the purpose for using the AUDIT-C (initial 
screening prior to further assessment vs. the only assessment). Because of the diversity of 
cutoffs used in prior literature, we initially employed integer categories of AUDIT-C to 
evaluate multiple candidate cutoff(s) (1, 2, 3, 4, 5–7, and 8+) for predicting mortality and 
physiologic frailty.
Alcohol use is often evaluated using quantity-frequency measures (i.e., total number of 
drinks over a certain timeframe) and an average of more than 2 drinks per day is considered 
potentially unhealthy alcohol use for men (Saitz, 2005; NIAAA, 2005). Therefore, we also 
created a variable for estimated total number of drinks per month using the first two items in 
the AUDIT-C. Categories included 1–2, 3–7, 8–29, 30–69, and 70+ drinks per month. We 
also considered HED (Smith et al., 2009) frequency separately.
2.4 Covariates
Covariates assessed include HIV status, age, race/ethnicity, smoking status, drug 
dependence-related diagnosis, and Hepatitis C. HIV status is based on a previously validated 
group of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes. Like 
AUDIT-C for alcohol, smoking status (current/past/never) is an automated EMR-based 
clinical reminder; drug dependence-related diagnoses are based on ICD-9 codes, and 
Hepatitis C is based on a combination of ICD-9 codes and laboratory data. Age was 
measured at the time of AUDIT-C and used as a continuous variable for descriptive statistics 
and categorized as <50, 50–64 and 65 years and over for regression models.

 2.5 Analysis
We compared characteristics of participants by HIV status using chi-square tests, t-tests and 
Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. We compared number of participants identified with unhealthy 
alcohol use based on AUDIT-C 4+ vs. a combination of HED and 30+ drinks per month. 
Mortality rates were summarized and compared graphically by HIV status and alcohol use 
levels (AUDIT-C scores, estimated quantity-frequency, and HED) and using Cox 
proportional hazard (PH) models. Multivariate Cox PH models for time to death were 
adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, smoking status, and Hepatitis C infection. Interactions 
between HIV and alcohol use levels were tested. Drug dependence-related diagnoses were 
not associated with the outcomes in the multivariate models, nor did their exclusion change 
the association of interest, so they were not included in the final models. VACS Index 
Scores were summarized graphically by HIV status and alcohol exposure (AUDIT-C scores, 
estimated quantity-frequency, and HED). Ordinary least squares linear regression models 
were used to quantify the association between alcohol exposure and VACS Index Scores. 
Multivariate models were adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, smoking status, and Hepatitis C. 
Since sensitivity to alcohol varies with age, and recommended drinking limits are lower for 
those older than 65 years of age, we repeated all analyses excluding those over age 65.
3. RESULTS
3.1 Demographics and Characteristics
There were 18,145 HIV+ and 42,228 uninfected individuals with an AUDIT-C score greater 
than zero. Mean age was 52.5 years for HIV+ and 54.0 years for uninfected individuals. The 
distribution of race/ethnicity and AUDIT-C scores was generally similar by HIV status. 
Hepatitis C was more prevalent among HIV+ (31%) than uninfected individuals (16%, p<.
001). Among HIV+ and uninfected individuals, 16% and 13% had a drug dependence-
related diagnosis code (p<.001), respectively. Most HIV+ individuals (76%) had achieved 
HIV-1 RNA suppression demonstrating effective ART. Mean VACS index was 30 for HIV+ 
and 21 for uninfected individuals (p<.001) (Table 1). Among HIV+ individuals, considering 
HED and drinks per month as separate criteria results in identifying 30% with unhealthy 
alcohol use compared to 24% using the overall AUDIT-C threshold of 4 or higher.
3.2 Mortality
Median follow-up was 4.8 years (interquartile range (IQR) 3.6 to 5.3). Mortality per 100 
person-years was 2.7 among HIV+ and 1.8 among uninfected individuals (p<.001, Table 1). 
Mortality rates increased with increasing AUDIT-C scores for both HIV+ and uninfected 
individuals (Figure 1a). However, the difference in mortality rates between HIV+ and 
uninfected individuals widened with higher AUDIT-C scores (interaction term from Cox PH 
model: p=.02). Similar patterns and significant interactions were found using number of 
drinks per month (Figure 1b) or HED (Figure 1c) as the measure of alcohol exposure.
In multivariable models, based on hazard ratios (HRs), the association between AUDIT-C 
scores of one, two, and three with the outcomes were similar, so the categories were 
combined so that the AUDIT-C referent group contains individuals with an AUDIT-C of 1–
3. Among HIV+ individuals, adjusted HRs for mortality were significantly higher for those

 with AUDIT-C of 4, 5–7, and 8–12 compared to those with AUDIT-C of 1–3. Among 
uninfected individuals, HRs were significantly higher for those with AUDIT-C scores of 5–
12 (Table 2). In a combined model HIV infection was associated with mortality (HR 1.35: 
95% CI 1.26–1.45) and the interaction term for HIV and AUDIT-C was significant (p=.02). 
Age, smoking, and hepatitis C infection were also significant predictors of mortality in all 
three models.
Number of drinks per month and HED in the past 12 months were also important predictors 
of mortality. Among HIV+ individuals, HRs for mortality were significantly higher for those 
drinking an estimated 30 or more drinks per month compared to those drinking 1–2 drinks 
per month (Table 3). Among uninfected individuals, HRs were significantly higher for those 
drinking an estimated 70 or more drinks per month compared to those drinking 1–2 drinks 
per month. Notably, a “J-shaped” relationship between drinks per month and risk of 
mortality was only observed for the uninfected, whereby 3–7 drinks per month (compared to 
1–2 drinks per month) was found to be protective (HR 0.86: 95% CI 0.78–0.95). In 
combined models, HIV infection was associated with higher risk of mortality (HR 1.28: 
95% CI 1.18, 1.40). Both drinks per month and HED in the past 12 months were 
independently associated with mortality and the interaction term for HIV and drinks per 
month was significant (p<.001). Age, smoking, and Hepatitis C infection were also 
significant predictors of mortality in all three models.
3.3 Physiologic Injury
Among HIV+ individuals, physiologic injury, as measured by VACS Index, increased with 
increasing AUDIT-C scores (Figure 2a). Similarly, injury increased with increasing number 
of drinks per month and increasing frequency of HED (Figures 2b–c). Additionally, the 
difference in physiologic injury between HIV+ and uninfected individuals was greater as all 
three measures of alcohol use increased (Figures 2a–c). In linear regression models adjusting 
for the same factors as models predicting all-cause mortality, the levels of alcohol use 
associated with injury were lower among HIV+ than among uninfected individuals (Tables 4 
and 5). AUDIT-C scores of 5–7 and 8–12 were significantly associated with physiologic 
injury among HIV+ individuals compared to those with AUDIT-C 1–3 (beta 0.47: 95% CI 
0.22, 0.73; and beta 1.05: 95% CI 0.77, 1.34, respectively). In contrast, only a score of 8–12 
was associated with injury among uninfected individuals (beta 0.29: 95% CI 0.16, 0.42) 
(Table 4). Interestingly, after adjusting for HED (which was not independently associated 
with VACS Index), drinking between 3 and 29 drinks a month was protective against injury 
among uninfected individuals (beta −0.23: 95% CI −0.33- (−0.12) and beta −0.16: 95% CI 
−0.27-(−0.04), respectively) whereas no level of use was protective among HIV+ 
individuals. Drinking 70 or more drinks per month was associated with injury among HIV+ 
individuals (beta 0.99: 95% CI 0.68–1.29) and HIV uninfected individuals (beta 0.19: 95% 
CI 0.04–0.34). The J-shaped associated between alcohol and physiologic injury was only 
observed for the uninfected group.
4. DISCUSSION
Compared with uninfected individuals, mortality and physiologic injury associated with 
discrete levels of alcohol exposure were higher among HIV+ individuals. While we found

 evidence of a J-shaped association between alcohol use, mortality, and physiologic injury 
among uninfected subjects, there was little evidence suggesting a protective effect of alcohol 
at any level of use among HIV+ individuals. Further, lower levels of alcohol exposure were 
associated with more harm among HIV+ individuals. Thresholds for risk were also lower 
among HIV+ individuals when physiologic injury was estimated using the VACS Index. 
Based on our findings, HIV+ individuals consuming more than 30 drinks per month are at 
increased risk of all-cause mortality and physiologic frailty. This would translate to a 
recommended drinking limit for HIV+ individuals of no more than 1 drink containing 
alcohol per day. This is lower than the current limits by the National Institute on Alcohol 
Abuse and Alcoholism recommended for men, which is no more than 14 drinks per week 
(equivalent to 2 drinks per day), and similar to the recommendations for women and those 
over 65 years pf age (NIAAA, 2005). This is the first study to demonstrate an association 
between low levels of alcohol use and mortality or physiologic injury among HIV+ 
individuals in the modern antiretroviral treatment era.
This is the most comprehensive study of the question of unhealthy alcohol consumption 
among HIV+ individuals to date. The VHA benefits from one of the largest and most 
comprehensive electronic health information systems in the world with some of the longest 
follow up (Affairs, 2006; Corrigan et al., 2003; McQueen et al., 2004). Our group has 
developed and validated a national multisite cohort of HIV+ individuals engaged in HIV 
treatment with demographically matched uninfected comparators. Drawing from the VHA 
EMR, we have clinical data supporting careful adjustment for important confounders 
including tobacco exposure and Hepatitis C infection. We were able to use national AUDIT-
C data collected in the course of routine clinical care to assess varying levels and patterns of 
alcohol exposure.
There are several, likely overlapping, reasons why HIV+ individuals might be more 
susceptible to physiologic harm from alcohol. First, they may experience higher blood 
alcohol levels given a unit exposure. This has been demonstrated among those with 
untreated HIV infection (McCance-Katz et al., 2013, 2012). Recent analyses in VACS have 
demonstrated that HIV+ individuals with unsuppressed HIV-1 RNA report the lowest 
number of drinks required to feel intoxicated, HIV+ individuals with suppressed HIV-1 
RNA report a higher number to experience intoxication and uninfected individuals report an 
even higher number of drinks to experience intoxication (McGinnis et al., 2015). Further, 
even modest alcohol use is associated with poorer adherence to antiretroviral therapy 
(Braithwaite and Bryant, 2010; Braithwaite et al., 2008, 2010) which can in turn increase 
susceptibility to harm. Collectively, these data suggest that HIV+ individuals are more 
susceptible to physiologic harm from alcohol. Our results support this hypothesis.
The VACS Index, an integrated measure of physiologic injury, has been widely recognized 
as a means of estimating physiologic injury and risk of frailty related outcomes among HIV
+ individuals in care (Akgun et al., 2014; Escota et al., 2014; Womack et al., 2013). The 
VACS Index includes many biomarkers known to be directly or indirectly influenced by 
alcohol exposure. CD4 count and HIV VL are altered by non-adherence to antiretroviral 
therapy which is strongly associated with alcohol use (Braithwaite and Bryant, 2010; 
Braithwaite et al., 2008). Hemoglobin, platelets, aspartate transaminase and alanine

 transaminase are altered by direct toxicity of alcohol and by non-adherence to antiretroviral 
treatment (Anderson et al., 2014; Conigliaro et al., 2003; Lo et al., 2014; Schmitt et al., 
1999; Sullivan et al., 2008). Given this dual effect of alcohol among HIV+ individuals, we 
might expect the VACS Index to be sensitive to adverse health effects from increasing 
alcohol exposure in this population and that is what we observed. Importantly, 76% of HIV+ 
individuals had achieved HIV virus suppression, suggesting that this susceptibility to 
alcohol does not disappear once suppressed. HIV+ individuals, even those on ART, are 
more susceptible to physiologic harm from alcohol.
An AUDIT-C score of 4 or more is often considered consistent with unhealthy alcohol use 
(Gordon et al., 2001) and 24% of HIV+ individuals in our study had scores at or above this 
threshold. However we found that HED and drinks per month were also independently 
associated with mortality suggesting that these criteria should be considered individually. 
When these were considered as separate criteria, 30%, or an additional 6%, of HIV+ 
individuals in VACS were identified with unhealthy alcohol use.
4.1 Limitations
Accurate measurement of exposure to alcohol is challenging. While self-report has 
limitations, it remains the standard in clinical settings. We used the AUDIT-C from the 
VHA EMR. At most sites AUDIT-C is asked face to face by a healthcare provider or health 
technician who records the patient’s response, an approach that may be subject to social 
desirability bias. There may also be quality issues related to how screening is conducted in 
routine clinical settings (non-verbatim screening, assumptions/inferences being made about 
patient responses, and inputting responses not reported; Williams et al., 2015). When 
compared with responses on a confidential survey, clinical AUDIT-C data tends to under 
report alcohol exposure equally by HIV status (Bradley et al., 2011). In addition, we did not 
separate out patients with alcohol use disorder in the current analysis. Because detection of 
alcohol use disorder in routine clinical settings is poor we were not confident that separating 
out those assigned a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder based on ICD-9 codes would help 
(Kim et al., 2012; Quan et al., 2008). While higher AUDIT-C scores have been proposed for 
this purpose, the AUDIT-C is not intended as a diagnostic tool for alcohol use disorder 
(Johnson et al., 2013; McGinnis et al., 2013; Rubinsky et al., 2010). These limitations would 
introduce misclassification which would dampen observed associations suggesting that the 
differences we were able to observe by HIV status may be under estimated. Finally, these 
data reflect information available to the clinician in the course of care.
Another important limitation was the need to exclude those who reported no exposure to 
alcohol in the past 12 months. By excluding non-drinkers, we are not able to determine 
whether there is a level of alcohol exposure measured by AUDIT-C that is “safe”. All our 
analyses were compared with the lowest score on the AUDIT-C among those reporting 
current alcohol use (a score of 1). Non-drinkers were excluded because non-drinkers are 
often people who quit drinking because they experienced adverse outcomes related to 
alcohol (so called, “sick quitters”; Fillmore et al., 2007; Shaper, 1990; Shaper and 
Wannamethee, 1998). For instance, in a recent VACS survey, 29% of subjects reported that 
they stopped drinking because they had problems due to alcohol (data not otherwise shown).

System.
4.2 Conclusion
In conclusion, among HIV+ individuals on ART, lower thresholds of alcohol use are 
associated with mortality and physiologic injury than among uninfected individuals. In both 
groups HED and drinks per month are independently associated with mortality and 
considering each as separate criteria identifies more individuals with unhealthy alcohol use.
