Abstract
Objective. To evaluate sufentanil sublingual tablet
30 mcg (SST 30 mcg) for postoperative pain in an
older patient population with comorbidities.
Design. Multicenter, open-label, single-arm study.
Setting. Nine hospitals across the United States.
Subjects. Adults aged �40 years who had under-
gone a surgical procedure.
Methods. Patients with a postoperative pain inten-
sity score �4 on an 11-point numeric rating scale
(NRS) were allowed to enter the study and receive
SST 30 mcg as requested for pain (minimum 60-min-
ute redosing interval) over the 12-hour study period.
Efficacy was assessed by patient reports of pain in-
tensity on the NRS and a five-point pain relief scale.
Safety was monitored throughout the study; plasma
sufentanil concentrations were also measured. The
primary efficacy endpoint was the time-weighted
summed pain intensity difference (SPID) to baseline
over 12 hours (SPID12).
Results. Of the 140 patients enrolled, 69% were

(SD 5 9.9 years), and average baseline pain intensity
was 6.2 (SD 5 1.9). The most common surgeries
were abdominal (59%) and orthopedic (20%). The
mean SPID12 was 36.0 (standard error of the mean
5 2.2); mean scores were similar, regardless of age,

 postdose, and mean pain relief increased signifi-
cantly starting 15 minutes postdose, remaining rela-
tively stable through 12 hours (P < 0.001 at each
time point). Four (3%) patients discontinued due to
inadequate analgesia, and 45 (32%) patients had
one or more adverse events that were considered
possibly or probably related to the study drug.
Mean plasma sufentanil concentrations were gener-
ally similar regardless of age, sex, BMI, or organ im-
pairment status.
Conclusions. SST 30 mcg was effective and well tol-
erated for the management of moderate-to-severe
acute postoperative pain.

Introduction
Despite improvements in medical techniques and the
development of novel drugs to treat acute pain, postop-
erative
pain
remains
clinically
undermanaged
[1,2].
Intravenous (IV) morphine remains a common treatment
for postoperative moderate-to-severe pain control [3]. IV
morphine has been consistently shown to reduce pain
following a surgical procedure [4,5] and has similar effi-
cacy compared with other opioids in providing postop-
erative analgesia [6–8]. However, IV morphine and other
opioids with active metabolites, including hydromor-
phone, have the potential issue of increased side effects
(respiratory depression, sedation, and delirium), due to
the variability in metabolite clearance, that could poten-
tially limit their use in certain populations including the
elderly and those with renal or hepatic impairment [9–
13]. Not surprisingly, data from a retrospective study of
319 898 surgeries from a national hospital database
showed that patients who experienced adverse events
(AEs) related to opioids had longer hospitalizations, in-
curred greater costs, and were more likely to be read-
mitted after discharge compared with patients who did
not have any AEs [14].
Sufentanil is a synthetic opioid analgesic that, unlike
morphine and hydromorphone, has no active (ie, clini-
cally relevant) metabolites, and dosing does not need to
be adjusted with regard to age [15], liver, or kidney
function [16,17]. Compared with other opioids, earlier
clinical studies suggest that sufentanil produces fewer
respiratory depressive effects relative to its analgesic
effects [18–21]; however, these studies only included a
small number of patients. Sufentanil has recently been
investigated as a 15-mcg sublingual tablet in a multi-
dose cartridge for patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) in
phase III trials for the treatment of postoperative pain
[22–25], with fewer patients experiencing oxygen desa-
turation events than patients administering IV morphine
PCA [23].
The sufentanil sublingual tablet 30 mcg (SST 30 mcg;
DSUVIA, AcelRx, Redwood City, CA, USA), adminis-
tered by a healthcare practitioner via a single-dose ap-
plicator,
is
in
development
for
more
short-term
analgesia settings, such as the emergency department,
ambulatory surgical settings, and for battlefield use. SST
30 mcg has the above-mentioned advantages of sufen-
tanil while providing noninvasive pain management for
acute pain. In a phase III study of patients treated with
SST 30 mcg or placebo following outpatient abdominal
surgery, SST 30 mcg was well tolerated and showed
superior pain control compared with placebo, with
reductions in pain intensity as early as 15 minutes after
the start of drug dosing [22]. An earlier phase II
placebo-controlled study demonstrated favorable effi-
cacy and tolerability in patients following bunionectomy
[26]. However, these studies did not report on the safety
of at-risk populations, such as older patients or patients
with hepatic or renal dysfunction.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety
and efficacy of SST 30 mcg for the management of
postoperative pain in patients age �40 years, with an
emphasis on enrolling patients with comorbidities (e.g.,
organ impairment, body mass index [BMI] � 30 mg/kg2,
hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes).
Methods
This was a multicenter, single-arm, open-label trial con-
ducted at nine investigational sites across the United
States. The protocol was approved by the institutional
review board for each study site, and written informed
consent was obtained from all patients. This study was
conducted

tered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02662556) in January
2016.
Primary Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
All patients were approached for study participation and
consented and screened up to 30 days prior to surgery.
Male and nonpregnant female patients age �40 years
who were scheduled to undergo a surgical procedure
with general anesthesia or spinal anesthesia that did not
include intrathecal opioids during the operation, and
who
were
classified
as
American
Society
of
Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical class I–III [27], were eli-
gible for inclusion.
Patients were excluded if they were opioid tolerant
(>15 mg oral morphine sulfate-equivalent daily) or were
dependent on supplemental oxygen at home.

 Study Treatment and Rescue Medication
Before the study drug was administered, the patient
must have reported a pain intensity score �4 on an 11-
point numeric rating scale (NRS; 0 ¼ no pain; 10 ¼ worst
possible pain) just prior to administration of the first
dose of SST 30 mcg. Eligible patients received their SST
30 mcg dose sublingually by a healthcare practitioner,
and following administration patients were evaluated
over a 12-hour study period. The minimum re-dosing in-
terval for SST 30 mcg was 60 minutes (up to the end of
the 12-hour study period). Patients could also receive—
upon request—rescue medication (1 mg IV morphine) if
analgesia with the study medication was insufficient, but
no sooner than 10 minutes following SST 30 mcg
dosing.
Efficacy and Safety Assessments Included in the
Analysis
Efficacy was assessed by patient reports of pain inten-
sity on the NRS and a five-point categorical pain relief
verbal
rating
scale
(0 ¼ no
relief;
1 ¼ a
little
relief;
2 ¼ moderate relief; 3 ¼ a lot of relief; 4 ¼ complete relief)
[28]. Pain intensity was initially recorded at baseline (im-
mediately prior to dosing). Pain intensity and pain relief
scores were evaluated at 15-minute intervals for the first
60 minutes, followed by every hour (from 2–12 hours) af-
ter administration of the first dose of SST 30 mcg.
The primary efficacy endpoint was the time-weighted
summed pain intensity difference (SPID) to baseline over
the 12-hour study period (SPID12). Secondary efficacy
endpoints included total pain relief throughout the study
and individual pain intensity and pain relief scores over
each evaluation time point. Patient global assessments
(PGAs)
[29,30]
and
healthcare
professional
global
assessments (HPGA) [31] were used to evaluate the
overall satisfaction (indicated as “poor,” “fair,” “good,” or
“excellent”), with SST 30 mcg as a pain control method.
Other secondary efficacy endpoints included the per-
centage of patients requiring rescue medication, the to-
tal number of doses of study and rescue medication,
and the proportion of patients terminated from the study
due to inadequate analgesia.
Safety was monitored via periodic measurement of vital
signs (i.e., respiratory rate, radial pulse rate, and blood
pressure) and continuous monitoring of oxygen satura-
tion, as well as assessment of AEs and the use of any
type of concomitant medications (including those used
to treat AEs). AEs—per the Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities v. 11.0—were defined as any ill-
ness, sign, laboratory value, or symptom that appeared
or worsened during the study, regardless of causal rela-
tionship to SST 30 mg. AE severity (mild, moderate, or
severe) and relationship to SST 30 mcg was assessed
by
the
investigators.
AE
relatedness,
described
as
“possibly or probably related” was defined as having
drug
administration
and
AE
occurrence
being
reasonably related in time. Relatedness was further de-
fined as the AE being explained equally well by causes
other than SST 30 mcg (possibly related) or more likely
explained by exposure to SST 30 mcg than by other
mechanisms (probably related).
Respiratory rate and other vital signs could be checked
at additional times on an ad hoc basis per clinical judg-
ment. Oxygen saturation was measured continuously by
pulse oximetry, but only recorded at time points when
respiratory rates were measured and recorded. Patients
with oxygen saturation values that could not be main-
tained above 95% or with respiratory rates below
8 breaths per minute were discontinued from the study.
Plasma samples for determination of sufentanil concen-
trations were drawn 1, 4, 8, and 12 hours following the
first dose of SST 30 mcg, or at the time of patient with-
drawal from the study.
Classification
of
organ
impairment
was
based
on
prestudy laboratory values. Hepatic impairment was de-
termined by aspartate transaminase and alanine trans-
aminase levels (normal: �upper limit of normal [ULN];
mild: >1–3 � ULN; moderate: >3–5 � ULN; severe:
>5–20 � ULN) and total bilirubin levels (normal: �ULN;
mild: >1–1.5 � ULN; moderate: >1.5–3 � ULN; severe:
>3–10 � ULN), and classification of renal impairment
was determined by creatinine levels and estimated glo-
merular filtration rate (eGFR; normal: �ULN of the creat-
inine
test;
mild:
abnormally
high
creatinine
and
eGFR � 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; moderate: abnormally high
creatinine and eGFR 30 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; se-
vere: abnormally high creatinine and eGFR <30 mL/min/
1.73 m2).
Statistical Analysis
A sample size
of approximately 150 patients was
planned for this analysis. All enrolled patients were
those who were enrolled and received treatment. For
patients who used any rescue medication during the
study period, the last observed pain intensity score prior
to using each dose of rescue medication was carried
throughout a follow-up one-hour time interval. Any pain
intensity data collected one hour or less after the start
of any rescue medication was excluded from the deriva-
tion of the efficacy endpoint (SPID).
All enrolled patients were included in the descriptive
summaries of efficacy and safety data. The pain assess-
ment data, pain intensity and pain relief, were consid-
ered as continuous measurements. A two-sided paired t
test was used for the test of pain intensity difference
(i.e., change in pain intensity from baseline) and pain re-
lief at follow-up time points within the group. All tests
were performed at a significance level of a ¼ 0.05.

 Results
Baseline Demographics and Patient Disposition
The first patient enrolled March 4, 2016, and the final
patient completed the study June 22, 2016. A total of
140 patients were enrolled and received study drug. All
were included in the ITT population and efficacy and
safety analyses (Figure 1). One-hundred and thirty-two
(94%) patients completed the 12-hour study period, and
eight (6%) patients prematurely terminated the study.
Reasons for early termination were AEs (four patients,
3%) and lack of efficacy (four patients, 3%). Overall, 40
(29%) patients had prestudy renal and/or hepatic impair-
ment (renal: N ¼ 10; hepatic: N ¼ 37; renal þ hepatic:
N ¼ 7), and the average baseline pain intensity was 6.2
(on a scale from 0–10) (Table 1). Before the end of the
12-hour study period, four (3%) patients discontinued
the study due to inadequate analgesia.
Study Drug Doses
Over the 12-hour study period, the mean total number
of study drug doses used for all patients was 3.3

 (SD ¼ 1.8) and was similar, regardless of hepatic or re-
nal function (Table 2). The mean interdosing interval for
all patients was 193.2 (SD ¼ 106.6) minutes.
Rescue Medication
Overall, 20 (14%) patients required rescue medication
due to inadequate analgesia. The median (range) time
to take the first dose of rescue medication due to
inadequate analgesia for those patients was 36.5 (12–
650) minutes. Thirteen of the 20 patients required a
single dose of rescue medication, three patients re-
quired two rescue doses, and four patients required
three or more rescue doses.
Efficacy
SPID12 scores (primary endpoint), a cumulative mea-
sure of pain intensity over the duration of the study,
were assessed to analyze pain control. The mean
SPID12 for all patients was 36.0 (standard error of the
mean ¼ 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 31.7–40.4).

Patient and HealthCare Professional Global
Assessments of Methods of Pain Control
In the global assessments of method of pain control,
53%, 35%, 7%, and 5% of 135 patients (PGA) and
50%, 40%, 8%, and 2% of 123 healthcare professionals
(HPGA), responded “excellent,” “good,” “fair,” or “poor,”
respectively, at the 12-hour time point.
Safety
Adverse Events
Over the 12-hour study period, the majority (63%, 88/
140) of patients did not incur an AE. Forty-five (32%)
patients had one or more AEs considered possibly or
probably related to study drug. The most frequently
reported AEs overall were nausea (27%), headache
(6%), and dizziness (4%) (Table 4). Oxygen saturation
levels were decreased in three (2.1%) patients, and
respiratory rate was decreased in one (0.7%) patient.
Psychiatric disorders (i.e., confusional state, euphoria,
and nervousness) and memory impairment considered
related to study drug were reported infrequently (0.7%
for each AE). One patient had a serious AE of acute
stroke that was not considered related to treatment as
it occurred more than 12 hours after discontinuation.
Four patients had AEs that led to discontinuation of SST
30 mcg; these were mild oxygen saturation decrease
(two patients < 95%), mild pruritus (one patient), and
mild dizziness (one patient).
Overall, 37% (38/103) of patients with normal hepatic
function and 38% (14/37) of patients with impaired he-
patic function had one or more AEs (see Table 4).
Similarly, 38% (49/130) of patients with normal renal
function and 30% (3/10) of patients with impaired renal
function had one or more AEs. The number and types
of AEs were similar for patients with normal or impaired
renal or hepatic function. Data in patients with renal im-
pairment should be interpreted with caution due to the
small number of patients (N ¼ 10) in this subgroup.
There were no clinically meaningful changes in mean vi-
tal signs, and no patient required naloxone during the
12-hour study period.
Plasma Sufentanil Concentration
The
mean
plasma
sufentanil
concentrations
for
all
patients were 37.2 (SD ¼ 22.5), 44.1 (SD ¼ 35.1), 35.7
(SD ¼ 27.7), and 30.4 (SD ¼ 28.5) pg/mL at 1, 4, 8, and
12 hours, respectively, and they were generally similar at
the beginning and end of the study, regardless of pa-
tient age (�65 vs < 65 years), sex, BMI (<30 kg/m2

Discussion
SST 30 mcg was effective for the management of
moderate-to-severe postoperative pain in patients who
had undergone a wide variety of surgery types. Most
commonly, these included abdominal (e.g., laparoscopic
or open-abdominal) and orthopedic (e.g., knee or hip
replacement,
bunionectomy)
procedures.
Statistical
improvements in pain control were observed within 15
to 30 minutes, with increases observed up until two
hours, and maintained through the remainder of the 12-
hour study period. Clinically relevant changes in pain in-
tensity in the acute postoperative setting have been
shown to be a decrease of 1.3 on the 11-point NRS or
a 20% decrease from baseline pain intensity [32]. This
occurred at approximately the 30-minute time point in
this study. Clinically relevant acute postoperative pain
relief scores have not been adequately validated in
trials.
Mean SPID12 scores demonstrated that there were no
clinically meaningful differences in pain control due to
age, sex, race, or BMI. When considering the global as-
sessment of SST 30 mcg as a method of pain control,
more than 85% of patients and 90% of healthcare pro-
viders responded favorably (i.e., good or excellent).
The first plasma sample was drawn 60 minutes after the
first SST 30 mcg dose had been administered, thereby
reflecting plasma concentrations achieved with a single
dose. The mean sufentanil plasma concentrations at the
three other time points were similar to that of the first
dose, suggesting that analgesic sufentanil concentra-
tions are achieved with the first dose and, on average,
patients are redosing to maintain these plasma drug
concentrations. Sufentanil plasma concentrations were
similar between subgroups (age, sex, and BMI) and be-
tween patients with and without hepatic or renal impair-
ment, as compared between the one-hour and 12-hour
time points. A previous phase III study by Melson and
colleagues
compared
patient-administered
sublingual
sufentanil 15 mcg with patient-controlled IV morphine
and found no difference in sufentanil concentrations in
patients with or without renal or hepatic impairment at
24 or 48 hours [23]. In contrast, patients with renal im-
pairment had significantly increased concentrations of
active metabolites of morphine (morphine-3-glucuronide

 and morphine-6-glucuronide) compared with patients
with normal renal functioning at 24 (P < 0.01) and 48
(P < 0.01) hours.
Active metabolites of morphine, as well as hydromor-
phone [33], can contribute to opioid-related AEs, such as
nausea, sleep disturbance, neuroexcitation, cognitive im-
pairment, dysphoria, and agitation [34–44]. For example,
nausea has been reported in up to 68% and 64% [34,44]
of patients and sleep disturbance in up to 82% and 73%
of patients [44,45] treated with morphine and hydromor-
phone, respectively, for postoperative acute pain [44].
Delayed penetration of active glucuronide metabolites into
the CNS (equilibration half-life between the plasma and
CNS [t1/2ke0] is more than six hours for M6G, more than
twice as long as the t1/2ke0 of its parent compound)
[46,47], as well as the relatively slow equilibration for mor-
phine (t1/2ke0 ¼ 168minutes) [47] and hydromorphone
(t1/2ke0 ¼ 46 minutes) [48], creates a high likelihood of
“dose stacking” and delayed AEs. In comparison, drug
equilibration for the lipophilic opioids fentanyl and sufenta-
nil is relatively rapid, with a median t1/2ke0 of 6.6 and
6.2minutes [49], respectively, allowing for faster onset of
analgesia and less risk of dose-stacking, and eliminating
concern for delayed effects of active metabolites.
The types of AEs reported in this study were generally
as expected in this type of patient population in a post-
operative setting. Overall, approximately one-third of
patients experienced at least one AE, with nausea being
the most common. Whereas IV morphine and other
similar opioids require dose adjustments and careful
monitoring of patients with hepatic or renal impairment
due to decreased drug clearance [9,12], no dose ad-
justment was necessary within our small sample size,
and AEs were similar between patients with normal or
impaired hepatic function or between those with normal
or impaired renal function.
This was an open-label, single-arm study, and therefore
results must be interpreted with caution. In a previous
placebo-controlled study of younger patients recovering
from abdominal surgery, SST 30 mcg was well tolerated
[22], with similar safety results between the active and
placebo treatment groups, as well as similar rates of AEs,
as observed in the current study. Results of the renal im-
pairment subgroup in the current study should be inter-
preted with caution due to the low number of patients
(N¼ 10) with renal impairment in this study.
The results of this study demonstrate that the sufentanil
sublingual tablet 30 mcg was effective, with onset of an-
algesia within 15 to 30 minutes postdose, and that it
was well tolerated for the management of moderate to
severe acute pain in postoperative patients, the majority
of whom had comorbidities prior to surgery.
