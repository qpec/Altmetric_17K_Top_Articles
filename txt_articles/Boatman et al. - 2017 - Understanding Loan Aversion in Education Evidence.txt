As the college-going population becomes increasingly 
diverse and the cost of college continues to rise, it is critical 
that we better understand the underlying mechanisms by 
which prospective students make decisions about whether 
and how to finance their education beyond high school. 
Student loans are an increasingly necessary tool to help stu-
dents pay for postsecondary education. Though 35% of all 
undergraduate students and 55% of all graduate students 
receive some type of federal loan to help finance their post-
secondary education (Snyder & Dillow, 2015), there appears 
to be a subset of students who are averse to taking out loans 
and, thus, will choose not to borrow money to finance their 
college education (Callendar & Jackson, 2005; Cunningham 
& Santiago, 2008). Loan aversion, as it applies to postsec-
ondary education, is generally defined as “an unwillingness 
to take a loan to pay for college, even when that loan would 
likely offer a positive long-term return” (Cunningham & 
Santiago, 2008, p. 10). Loan-averse students are those inter-
ested in investing in higher education but not willing to take 
out loans to do so (Palameta & Voyer, 2010). Although a 
handful of studies have provided initial evidence that loan 
aversion may affect students’ decisions about investing in 
college, this study further tests the hypothesis that loan aver-
sion exists and is widespread in the United States among 
current and prospective college students.
Evidence of the existence of loan aversion has been found 
among students in various contexts (Burdman, 2005; 
Caetano, Palacios, & Patrinos, 2011; Callendar & Jackson, 
2005; Cunningham & Santiago, 2008; Goldrick-Rab & 
Kelchen, 2013; Palameta & Voyer, 2010), but much of the 
empirical work has been done outside the United States. 
Goldrick-Rab and Kelchen (2013) sampled students from 
Wisconsin to estimate the extent of loan aversion, but because 
their sample has already enrolled in college, their findings 
may not be generalizable to individuals who are not currently 
enrolled in higher education. The present study overcomes 
this limitation by obtaining samples from three different pop-
ulations: high school seniors, community college students, 
and adults who are not currently enrolled in higher education. 
We include high school students as we are interested in how 
attitudes about borrowing money for college might shape the 
decision to borrow and enroll in higher education. Community 
college students have already made a decision about borrow-
ing money for college and, as a result, may have attitudes 
about borrowing that differ from those of high school stu-
dents. In addition, community college students constitute an 
important population of students in higher education as 
almost 50% of undergraduates are enrolled in a public com-
munity college (College Board, 2011). Adults who do not 
have a college degree provide another, unique perspective 
into attitudes about borrowing given their experience in the 
labor market and managing their own finances. They may 
also be future college students.
Within any of these three populations, little quantitative 
evidence exists to identify how loan aversion varies by 
demographic characteristics. Cunningham and Santiago 
(2008) suggest Asian and Hispanic college students are less 
likely to borrow, but it is not clear if those preferences are a

Although prior research has suggested that some students may be averse to taking out loans to finance their college educa-
tion, there is little empirical evidence showing the extent to which loan aversion exists or how it affects different populations 
of students. This study provides the first large-scale quantitative evidence of levels of loan aversion in the United States. Using 
survey data collected on more than 6,000 individuals, we examine the frequency of loan aversion in three distinct populations. 
Depending on the measure, between 20 and 40% of high school seniors exhibit loan aversion with lower rates among com-
munity college students and adults not in college. Women are less likely to express loan-averse attitudes than men, and 
Hispanic respondents are more likely to be loan averse than White respondents.

result of loan aversion. In addition to contributing to the evi-
dence suggesting that loan aversion exists among students in 
the United States, our study also measures how loan aver-
sion varies by gender, income, parental education, and race.
Loan aversion may lead to negative outcomes for some 
students. Given that student loans are the primary policy 
mechanism by which to relieve credit constraints, a reluc-
tance to borrow implies loan-averse students could poten-
tially underinvest in higher education. This underinvestment 
could manifest itself in a variety of ways: working more 
hours while enrolled, enrolling in 2-year instead of 4-year 
colleges, enrolling part-time instead of full-time, delaying 
college enrollment after high school, or forgoing college 
altogether. These decisions may adversely affect enrollment, 
persistence, and success in college. For example, research 
suggests that too many hours of work may have a negative 
effect on students’ college grade point average (GPA; Scott-
Clayton, 2011; Soliz & Long, 2016; Stinebrickner & 
Stinebrickner, 2003), and lower- and middle-income stu-
dents engage in this behavior at higher rates than their upper-
income peers (authors’ calculations using Educational 
Longitudinal Study of 2002). Moreover, delaying enroll-
ment, enrolling less than full-time, or enrolling in a 2-year 
college rather than a 4-year college has also been shown to 
have a negative effect on students’ probability of persistence 
and degree completion (Attewell, Heil, & Reisel, 2012; 
DesJardins, Ahlburg, & McCall, 2006; Long & Kurlaender, 
2009; Monaghan & Attewell, 2014).
This study seeks to better understand loan aversion 
among students in the United States, drawing upon eco-
nomic and sociological theory to describe why loan aversion 
may exist. Through the collection and analysis of a unique 
data set of over 6,000 high school seniors, community col-
lege students, and adults without a degree who are not 
enrolled in college, we measure the extent of loan aversion 
among a diverse population in an effort to assess differences 
in loan aversion by gender, race, income, and first-genera-
tion college status. Within our survey, we replicate the ques-
tions of past studies in order to compare different measures 
of loan aversion used in the previous literature (Callendar & 
Jackson, 2005; Palameta & Voyer, 2010). Our three research 
questions are as follows:
1. 
To what extent is loan aversion present among high 
school students, community college students, and 
adults not enrolled in college?
2. 
What is the relationship between different measures 
of loan aversion?
3. 
Does loan aversion vary by individual characteris-
tics?
Someone who is loan averse may underinvest in higher 
education, likely leading to lower lifetime earnings and pos-
sibly reducing the educational attainment of his or her 
children. This behavior also has negative implications for 
society, as higher education is strongly correlated with 
healthier, more engaged citizens and provides a greater tax 
base for government funding (Baum, Ma & Payea, 2013). If 
loan aversion exists, our second research question addresses 
how to measure it. Finally, loan aversion may affect some 
potential students more than others. If, for example, loan 
aversion affects the college investment decisions of females 
more than males, this has implications for policy interven-
tions designed to ameliorate this problem.
Our study contributes to the extant literature in several 
ways. First, we replicate the survey questions of Callendar 
and Jackson (2005) and Palameta and Voyer (2010), who 
conducted their studies in England and Canada, respectively, 
in the context of the United States among three separate 
populations: high school seniors, community college stu-
dents, and adults without a college degree who are not 
enrolled in higher education. Second, by surveying popula-
tions who are not currently enrolled in higher education, we 
improve upon the existing literature. Studies limited to sam-
ples already enrolled in higher education may underestimate 
the effects of loan aversion if students who were averse did 
not initially enroll, and for this reason, we sample two groups 
(high school seniors and adults) prior to enrolling in college. 
Third, we demonstrate how three distinct measures of loan 
aversion, all of which exist in the literature, compare to each 
other within the same sample. Finally, we provide evidence 
of how the various definitions of loan aversion vary by 
respondent characteristics, which is notably absent in the 
literature.
Theory and Literature on Loan Aversion
Rational Economic Theory on Borrowing for Higher 
Education
According to standard economic theory, a student decides 
whether or not to enroll in college using a standard cost-
benefit analysis. A potential college student assesses the cost 
of enrolling by factoring in tuition and fees, room and board, 
and available financial aid. The student weighs those costs 
against the discounted future benefits associated with the 
degree, including greater earnings. Economic theory would 
suggest that a rational student will enroll in college when the 
benefits outweigh the costs (Avery & Hoxby, 2004).
Given the evidence on the significant financial returns 
to college credentials, investing in higher education is, on 
average, a smart economic decision for students (Avery & 
Turner, 2012; Carnevale, Rose, & Cheah, 2011; Hoekstra, 
2009; Kane & Rouse, 1995). The average benefit of earn-
ing a bachelor’s degree compared to a high school diploma 
has increased at a faster rate since the 1960s than the cost 
of a college education (Avery & Turner, 2012). However, 
not all students can afford the direct costs even if they want 
to enter college. Student loans are available to resolve this

credit constraint. Individuals must decide how much debt 
to take on relative to the potential payoffs in future earn-
ings. Although students are taking on more debt than in 
previous decades, the ratio of student loan payment to 
income has remained constant at between 9% and 11% 
(Baum & Schwartz, 2006). Even conservative estimates of 
the median value in lifetime earnings associated with a col-
lege degree (around $800,000 over a lifetime) far surpass 
the average national loan debt of $27,850 for those who 
earn a 4-year degree (Hershbein & Kearney, 2014; Institute 
for College Access and Success, 2015). These numbers 
suggest that borrowing for a college degree is, on average, 
a good decision.
Despite these average outcomes, some students may 
decide not to borrow or to borrow a small amount for ratio-
nal reasons. For example, if students carefully consider their 
degree, major choice, and labor market prospects and decide 
that they are unlikely to earn enough to repay their loan, then 
avoiding borrowing may be completely rational. Using stu-
dent loans to finance one’s postsecondary education also has 
potential negative implications. Among students who gradu-
ate with a degree, many report delaying buying a house 
(40%), buying a car (31%), having children (22%), moving 
out of their parents’ house (21%), and getting married (15%) 
due to educational loans (Baum & Saunders, 1998). Gladieux 
and Perna (2005) found that the negative ramifications of 
educational debt are particularly high for the approximately 
20% of student borrowers who drop out without earning a 
degree. Students who drop out experience fewer gains in 
employment and income, as well as higher loan default rates, 
than students who earn a degree (Gladieux & Perna, 2005). 
McKinnery and Burridge (2015) found that community col-
lege students with federal loans were over 2 times more 
likely to drop out over a 3- and 6-year period compared to 
nonborrowers. However, Gladieux and Perna demonstrate 
that the risk factors related to socioeconomic status best pre-
dict whether students will drop out, not their decision to 
borrow.
Aside from these rational reasons for not borrowing, 
some students may be unwilling to borrow even though 
investing in higher education would result in positive eco-
nomic returns. Traditional economic theory argues that these 
students are behaving irrationally. In this sense, loan aver-
sion may present a policy problem, making it important to 
measure the extent of this phenomenon within our samples. 
Although we present various measures of loan aversion, our 
study is not able to disentangle rational from irrational 
preferences.
Behavioral Economic and Sociological Explanations for 
Loan Aversion
Behavioral economics offers several potential explana-
tions for loan aversion.1 Previous literature has demonstrated 
that the complexity of the financial aid system prevents 
some prospective students from applying for aid (Bettinger, 
Long, Oreopoulos, & Sanbonmatsu, 2012; Dynarski & 
Scott-Clayton, 2006), and this complexity may deter stu-
dents from borrowing. Because the Free Application for 
Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) requires knowledge of prior-
year earnings and assets, individuals for whom this informa-
tion is not readily understood or accessible may elect not to 
apply for financial aid and, thus, not attend college. Similarly, 
there is evidence that many people living in poverty do not 
open bank accounts because of small obstacles, such as dis-
tance to the nearest bank (Bertrand, Mullainathan, & Shafir, 
2006). Some prospective students may be highly risk averse 
and, therefore, avoid any decision that could result in a nega-
tive outcome, such as defaulting on their student loans if 
they fail to secure a job or end up earning less than expected 
(Rabin & Thaler, 2001). This rationale is further supported 
by cumulative prospect theory (Tversky & Kahneman, 
1992), which suggests people tend to overweight extreme 
events even when their likelihood of occurrence is quite low. 
Student loan default may be viewed as such an event, and 
students averse to borrowing may be overweighting the risk 
inherent in borrowing.
In addition, behavioral economics suggests that framing 
and labeling effects matter. Typically, people make decisions 
based around a reference point (Tversky & Kahneman, 
1992), and individuals may make different decisions depend-
ing on the frame or the label of the reference point. For 
example, Caetano et al. (2011) demonstrate that students in 
Latin America differentially respond to financially equiva-
lent contracts to finance education depending on whether the 
contract is labeled a “loan.” In the United States, Field 
(2009) used an experimental design to explore the instances 
of loan aversion among law students at New York University. 
Students interested in careers in public service were ran-
domly assigned to receive one of two financially equivalent 
aid offers: a loan to pay tuition that would be paid back by 
the school if the student ended up in public service or tuition 
assistance in the form of grants that students would have to 
pay back if they did not end up in public service law. Students 
who were offered the grants were twice as likely to enroll as 
students who were offered the loans and were 36% more 
likely to enter public-interest law within 2 years after gradu-
ation. Collectively, these findings suggest that a subset of 
prospective students is averse to borrowing due to framing 
and/or labeling effects.
In addition to behavioral economics, there are several 
sociological explanations for loan aversion. Prior negative 
experience in credit markets by students and their families 
could deter potential borrowers from taking on student debt. 
Although we are not aware of any evidence linking parental 
student loan debt with borrowing decisions, there is evi-
dence that observed negative experiences with parental 
credit card debt is linked to negative perceptions of credit

card usage (Joo, Grable, & Bagwell, 2003). If students 
observed their family’s struggles with debt, especially fore-
closures during the 2007 housing market crash, they may 
wish to avoid future borrowing. This may also be true of 
adults who have had their own negative experiences in the 
credit market. Finally, it is possible that cultural differences 
in the preference for debt explain some of this difference. 
Research has found that Asian and Hispanic students are less 
likely to borrow for college than White students, suggesting 
possible racial differences in loan aversion (Cunningham & 
Santiago, 2008; ECMC Group Foundation, 2003; Hillman, 
2015), although researchers continue to explore the reasons 
behind these trends. These preferences may apply to more 
than student loan debt and could affect other forms of bor-
rowing as well. Our study attempts to shed light on this 
proposition by measuring borrowing attitudes generally and 
specific to higher education across a racially and socioeco-
nomically diverse population of respondents.
Loan Aversion in the Education Literature
Some previous studies have hypothesized that loan aver-
sion may affect students’ decisions about enrolling in college 
without providing empirical evidence that the phenomenon 
exists. St. John (1993) cites loan aversion as a possible expla-
nation for why low-income students’ college enrollment is not 
associated with borrowing, and Paulsen and St. John (2002) 
state, “Latinos choose to attend colleges with lower costs and 
are more loan averse than other ethnic groups” (p. 211). 
Despite these arguments, neither paper offers evidence of loan 
aversion. Many other papers have also cited loan aversion as 
a potential explanation for student borrowing behavior (Avery 
& Turner, 2012; Dowd & Coury, 2006; Malcom & Dowd, 
2012; Perna, 2008; Rothstein & Rouse, 2011), but none of 
these analyses have examined the extent of this phenomenon 
across different populations of respondents.
Only a handful of empirical studies help us understand 
how widespread the problem of loan aversion is or how it 
affects students’ decisions about college enrollment and 
financial aid. Qualitative studies have cited lower levels of 
borrowing among students as evidence of loan aversion 
(Burdman, 2005; Xue & Chao, 2015). This definition of loan 
aversion is unsatisfying as lower levels of borrowing could 
be explained by students attending lower-cost institutions or 
having unobserved resources used to finance higher educa-
tion. Goldrick-Rab and Kelchen (2013) offer evidence that 
loan aversion exists among a specific population of college 
students in the United States by examining nearly 700 first-
year Pell Grant recipients attending the public college sys-
tem in Wisconsin. They identify students as loan averse if 
they either did not accept a loan offered in a financial aid 
package or responded on a survey question that they would 
not choose any loan aid if offered and conclude that 48% of 
their sample is loan averse by these two definitions. Although 
these measures may capture some degree of loan aversion, 
they may be biased. The students surveyed may have other 
unobserved financial resources that obviate borrowing, in 
which case the students labeled loan averse might be willing 
to borrow but simply find it unnecessary, leading to esti-
mates biased upward. On the other hand, because the study 
samples only students who have already applied for finan-
cial aid and enrolled in college, it may underestimate loan 
aversion if it prevents potential students from enrolling in 
college entirely.
The two studies we rely upon most heavily in this paper 
use survey methods to explore loan aversion for students 
outside the United States. Callender and Jackson (2005) sur-
veyed 1,954 prospective college students in England to 
explore the relationship between students’ attitudes toward 
debt and their college enrollment decisions. They find that 
students from low socioeconomic classes are more debt 
averse than those from other social classes, and this aversion 
deters their pursuit of higher education. Palameta and Voyer 
(2010) present 1,248 Canadian students in their final year of 
high school or 1st year of college with the option of accept-
ing financial aid for college in the future versus accepting 
smaller amounts of cash in the present. Respondents chose 
between grants versus cash or combinations of grants and 
loans versus cash. The authors define loan aversion as the 
decision to take a grant only when it is stand-alone and not 
when it is offered in combination with an optional loan. 
Palameta and Voyer find that between 5% and 20% of the 
sample are loan averse, with a higher propensity among 
underrepresented groups (Aboriginals, boys, and students’ 
whose parents are not college educated).
Collectively, the empirical evidence on loans suggests 
somewhere between 5% and 50% of students or prospective 
students are loan averse and that loan aversion varies by 
individual characteristics, such as gender, race, and income, 
but not always in consistent ways. Furthermore, prior studies 
all use different measures of loan aversion and were con-
ducted either outside the United States, only on traditional 
students, or only on a group of students who had already 
made the choice to enroll in higher education. Our paper 
addresses these limitations and makes important additional 
contributions to the literature on loan aversion. Using survey 
methods, we gather a unique data set comprising samples 
from three distinct populations (high school seniors, com-
munity college students, and adults without a degree who are 
not enrolled in college) and explore the concept of loan aver-
sion using three different measures from the previous litera-
ture. By exploring respondents’ attitudes and choices about 
borrowing money generally and specifically for education, 
our study is the first to examine multiple measures of loan 
aversion in a variety of contexts for three distinct popula-
tions of potential and current college students.
 Understanding Loan Aversion

Conceptualizing and Operationalizing Loan Aversion
Unlike previous studies that rely on a single measure or a 
response to a single question, we assess loan aversion in 
three distinct ways, thereby enabling broader content valid-
ity across multiple dimensions of loan aversion. Our three 
measures of loan aversion are based on (a) respondents’ atti-
tudes toward borrowing, (b) respondents’ beliefs that it is 
acceptable to borrow money to pay for education, and (c) 
respondents’ preferences between cash and hypothetical 
financial aid packages that include grants alone or grants and 
loans combined. Below, we describe how we operationalize 
each of our three measures of loan aversion. For each mea-
sure of loan aversion, see online Appendix A for the specific 
question asked on the survey. Additional details about the 
survey instruments are available in the online Data Appendix.
Respondents’ Attitudes Toward Borrowing
A common hypothesis is that aversion to borrowing var-
ies across race in large part due to cultural differences in the 
perception and value of money (Cunningham & Santiago, 
2008; Lynn, 1991). If variation in attitudes can be explained 
by demographic characteristics, it lends support to this 
hypothesis. To measure these attitudes, we borrow directly 
from a survey used by Callender and Jackson (2005) to 
assess students’ debt attitudes in England. We include survey 
items that ask students to respond on a 5-poing Likert scale 
(strongly agree to strongly disagree) the extent to which they 
agree or disagree with three statements: “You should always 
save up first before buying something,” “Owing money is 
basically wrong,” and “There is no excuse for borrowing 
money.” These three statements vary in their severity, with 
the first allowing for a less aggressive stance on borrowing 
compared to the second and especially compared to the 
third. Therefore, answering strongly agree or agree for the 
last question should imply agreement with the earlier two. 
Indeed, we see a pattern of responses for these three ques-
tions that strongly suggest an ordered scale, with the coeffi-
cient of reproducibility for all three samples greater than 
98%. As a result, we use Guttman scaling to create a debt-
averse scale based upon the binary measures of answering 
strongly agree or agree on these three questions (hereafter 
termed Attitudes Scale). Responses are measured on a scale 
that ranges from 0 to 3, in which respondents who received 
a 0 displayed no loan-averse attitudes and respondents who 
received a 3 answered they agree or strongly agree with 
“There is no excuse for borrowing money,” the most severe 
statement.
A primary advantage of this measure is that it assesses 
general attitudes toward borrowing that can apply regardless 
of the scenario. This allows for a more holistic definition of 
loan aversion that is not specific to any one item or purchase. 
We also use a scaling technique to weight respondents’ 
answers, thus acknowledging the nuance in borrowing atti-
tudes that may exist. A downside of this measure is that it is 
not directly related to a specific borrowing decision. As we 
are especially interested in respondents’ attitudes toward 
borrowing money for education, our second measure pro-
vides a more direct test of this particular decision.
Respondents’ Beliefs That It Is Acceptable to Borrow 
Money to Pay for Education
To further gauge respondents’ attitudes toward borrowing 
money, we supplement Callender and Jackson’s (2005) debt 
attitude questions with questions similar to those the Federal 
Reserve has used to collect data on consumer behavior. 
Mortenson (1988) conducted an analysis of willingness to 
borrow for educational expenses using borrowing questions 
from a nationally representative survey collected by the 
Federal Reserve. Specifically, we ask, “Do you think it is 
okay to borrow for education?” To test loan aversion for 
educational expenses, we define a respondent as loan averse 
if he or she did not answer yes to this question, a measure 
similar to the one Mortenson uses to identify loan-averse 
students (hereafter termed Borrow for Education).
An advantage of this measure is that it provides a direct 
assessment of a respondent’s attitude toward borrowing 
money for education; however, it does not capture attitudes 
toward borrowing more broadly. Since aversion to borrow-
ing money for education is the specific phenomenon we 
strive to define and understand, the Borrow for Education 
definition is an important complement to Attitudes Scale.
Cash Versus Loans in Financial Aid Packages
Finally, we measure whether students avoid loans in 
financial aid packages. This measure has the advantage of 
identifying loan aversion specifically in the context of bor-
rowing for college. Instead of simply asking respondents 
their attitudes about borrowing money generally (Attitudes 
Scale) or borrowing money for college (Borrow for 
Education), we asked respondents to make a series of choices 
between taking different amounts of cash or various finan-
cial aid packages. Following Palameta and Voyer (2010), 
survey respondents were asked, for instance, to choose 
whether they would prefer $300 in cash or a $1,000 grant 
when they enroll in college. Some of the financial aid pack-
ages include only grants, whereas others are a combination 
of grants and loans. We identify loan-averse respondents as 
those who chose financial aid offers over cash when the 
financial aid package consisted only of grants but accepted 
cash over financial aid when the financial aid package 
included loans (hereafter termed Avoid Loan Packages). For 
example, we define a respondent as loan averse if he or she 
prefers $1,000 in grants over $300 in cash but prefers $300 
 Boatman et al.
6
in cash over a financial aid package of $1,000 grants and 
$1,000 in loans. If the respondent did not need the additional 
loan money, he or she could immediately repay the loan and 
still have the $1,000 in grant aid. Therefore, there must be a 
characteristic of his or her preferences that makes the finan-
cial aid package with a loan less desirable than one with the 
same amount of grant aid but without the loan. If respon-
dents change their preferences due to the inclusion of a loan, 
we define them as loan averse.
The advantage of this measure is that it is contextually 
situated in an actual decision people face when making 
choices about financial aid. The downside of this measure is 
that the question may be difficult to understand, casting 
doubt on its reliability. We observed 6.2% of the sample 
making unreasonable choices that suggest that they did not 
understand this question.2 These respondents prefer a lower 
amount of cash over an aid package but then prefer the same 
aid package over a higher cash amount. We exclude these 
respondents for our Avoid Loan Packages measure through-
out our analyses, although our findings are robust to their 
inclusion (results available upon request).
Methods and Data
Sample Selection and Data
We collected survey data from three different popula-
tions: high school seniors, community college students, and 
adults ages 20 to 39 without a college degree who were not 
currently enrolled in higher education. We sampled from 
three distinct populations because we hypothesize that the 
extent of loan aversion may vary by characteristics, includ-
ing age, experience with higher education, and experience 
with the credit market. For example, as individuals age and 
have more experience with the credit market, this could 
make them more or less willing to borrow for education, 
depending on whether these experiences are positive or neg-
ative. The high schools were selected randomly across all 
racially diverse public high schools in Texas, Kentucky, 
Tennessee, and Massachusetts and supplemented with a 
diverse sample of community college students and adults. 
Ultimately, we surveyed 2,140 high school students, 4,278 
community college students, and 843 adults.
To save time during the school day and reduce the survey 
burden on high school seniors, we used two different forms 
of the survey with slightly different question sets for the 
high school sample. Only one form measured our Borrow 
for Education loan aversion definition, so our sample for 
this measure is half the size of the others. We randomly 
assigned the two forms of the survey, thereby avoiding 
 
bias. Comparisons across 10 demographic characteristics 
between respondents from the two survey forms show only 
one statistically significant difference, reassuring us that the 
randomization process was successful. Additional details 
about the sampling methodology are available in the online 
Data Appendix (including an analysis of missing data).
Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics for each of our three analytic sam-
ples are displayed in Table 1. Our primary sampling goal 
was to reach a racially diverse set of respondents as well as 
a diverse sample based on gender, age, and other demo-
graphics to enable subgroup analysis of loan aversion. 
Although our high school sample includes an even distribu-
tion of male and female students, we had many more women 
complete the survey in the community college and adult 
samples (over 70% female for both). Our community col-
lege sample is also disproportionally White (45% compared 
to 35% for the high school students and 28% for the adults). 
This is not surprising because, although we chose commu-
nity colleges that had diverse populations, we did not explic-
itly sample on race among community college sites. Despite 
not sampling on race, the racial demographics of our com-
munity college sample are representative of community col-
leges nationwide. Our community college sample includes 
45% White respondents, 10% Black respondents, and 29% 
Hispanic respondents, compared to the national enrollment 
averages for American community colleges of 49% White, 
14% Black, and 22% Hispanic (National Center for 
Education Statistics, 2014). The racial breakdown of our 
high school and adult samples are also roughly reflective of 
national numbers, with lower rates of White and higher rates 
of Black respondents (53% White, 15% Black, 23% Hispanic 
for high school seniors nationally and 50% White, 16% 
Black, 28% Hispanic for 18- to 40-year-old adults without a 
college degree nationally).3
We also sought a sample of low-income students at least 
as socioeconomically disadvantaged as the national average. 
Respondents in the high school sample are defined as low 
income if they receive free or reduced-price lunch, and over 
46% of them did relative to 36% of all seniors nationally. 
Respondents in the community college and adult samples 
are defined as low income if they received any of the follow-
ing forms of federal public assistance within the past 2 years: 
Pell; Temporary Assistance for Needy Families; Special 
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and 
Children (WIC); or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 
Program. Nearly 55% of community college respondents 
were low income compared with 38% nationally who receive 
federal education grants, and approximately 42% of the 
adult sample is low income relative to 45% at 185% of the 
federal poverty line nationally (the qualifying level for 
WIC). All three samples have high aspirations to obtain 
postsecondary degrees. Although adults who are not enrolled 
in college are less likely to aspire to obtain a degree than the 
other two samples, over 68% hope to earn at least an associ-
ate’s degree. This indicates a high likelihood that some 
 7
portion of the adult sample will face the future decision to 
borrow for education. Parental education is similar across 
the high school and community college samples (60% to 
65% have a parent who attended college). The adult sample 
comes from families with noticeably less educational 
attainment.
Empirical Strategy
We first examine each of the above three measures of loan 
aversion (Attitudes Scale, Borrow for Education, and Avoid 
Loan Packages) individually across each of the three samples 
and use ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc tests to formally 
test whether loan aversion varies across these samples. We 
then explore the relationship across these measures to see if 
or how they might be related to one another by examining the 
correlation between each measure in each sample. We also 
explore whether the existence of loan aversion varies across 
student characteristics first by using t tests to compare each 
of the loan aversion measures by student characteristics. To 
simultaneously control for all of our demographic character-
istics, we then run the following regression model separately 
for each of the three populations:

Note. Sample size for high school borrowing for education loan-aversion definition is 823. Standard deviations are reported in parentheses for nonbinary vari-
ables. Low income is defined for high school seniors as those who reported being eligible for free or reduced-price lunch and for the community college and 
adult samples as having received a form of federal assistance within the past 2 years (Pell; Temporary Assistance for Needy Families; Special Supplemental 
Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children; or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program).

whether his or her parents graduated from college. Models 
for the high school sample also include the respondent’s self-
reported GPA to account for the fact that some loan aversion 
may be driven by poor academic performance reducing the 
likelihood of pursuing higher education. We did not collect 
this information for community college students, which is a 
limitation, but as they have already enrolled in higher educa-
tion, we do not believe it likely that academic performance in 
college is a strong driver of loan aversion. For the community 
college sample, we include several measures of financial aid 
dependency status, including binary measures for being mar-
ried, having children, having a dependent other than a child, 
being active-duty military, and being a veteran. These con-
trols are theoretically important given research suggesting 
that those with more children are more likely to have favor-
able attitudes toward credit, and married individuals are more 
likely to have installment loans, such as student loans or car 
loans (Chien & Devaney, 2001). Although we do not observe 
marital status, dependents, and military status for the high 
school and adult samples, these characteristics are unlikely to 
vary much for high school seniors. These variables serve as 
omitted variables for the adult sample; however, the inclu-
sion of these variables for the community college students 
only slightly attenuates the coefficients, so we believe any 
bias is very small (community college results available from 
the authors upon request). Fixed effects for high school or 
community college are included as γj. Regression standard 
errors are clustered at the high school level for the high school 
sample and the college level for the community college 
sample.
Results
To What Extent Is Loan Aversion Present Among High 
School Students, Community College Students, and Adults 
Not Enrolled in College?
In Tables 2, 3, and 4, we present the proportions of 
respondents who are loan averse by our three measures 
across each of the three samples. Our first measure, Attitudes 
Scale, is derived from the survey responses to three state-
ments about borrowing money generally. As shown in Table 
2, the majority of respondents in all three samples believe 
one should always save up first before buying something, 
the weakest of the three statements. A smaller but still sub-
stantial number of respondents in each sample (between 8% 
and 12%) agree with the most severe statement, that “there 
is no excuse for borrowing money.” When we use Guttman 
scaling to combine these three responses into a 0-to-3 scale 
score, we find that loan aversion, as defined by attitudes 
about borrowing money, exists for all three samples. By this 
definition, the adult sample is the most loan averse, followed 
by the high school respondents and the community college 
respondents. A one-way ANOVA demonstrates that the dif-
ferences between samples are statistically significant, and 
the Bonferroni post hoc tests demonstrate that the differ-
ences between each pairing are statistically significant.
Moving to a definition of loan aversion that centers on 
education (Borrow for Education), Table 3 demonstrates that 
loan aversion exists in all three samples but to varying 
degrees. Twenty-one percent of high school students do not 
think it is okay to borrow money to pay for education, com-
pared to 20% of adults and 9% of community college stu-
dents. We expected community college students to exhibit 
less loan aversion when asked explicitly about borrowing for 
education given that over half of the respondents (55%) 
reported on a separate survey question that they had bor-
rowed some amount of money to attend. Approximately one 
in every five high school seniors and adults who are not in 
college do not believe it is okay to borrow for education. 
ANOVA results allow us to conclude the community college 
sample has significantly lower loan aversion by this measure 
but that there is no difference between the high school and 
adult samples. The results of this question suggest that a sub-
stantial number of high school seniors and adults not in col-
lege may be deterred from investing in higher education 
because of their desire to avoid borrowing.

Table 4 demonstrates that an even larger percentage of 
each sample may be defined as loan averse when loan aver-
sion is defined by their choices between various financial aid 
packages and cash (Avoid Loans Packages). Given the com-
plexity of this question, we first examined whether any stu-
dents made sets of decisions that would suggest they did not 
understand the prompt. We examined how many students 
stated they preferred a smaller amount of cash to an aid 
package but that same aid package compared to a larger 
amount of cash. There were 175 high school seniors, 138 
community college students, and 72 adults who made these 
types of errors. When these respondents are excluded, the 
results suggest that nearly 39% of the high school sample, 
over 33% of the community college sample, and over 23% 
of the adult sample preferred a financial aid package to cash 
when the package included only a grant but switched to

an aid package but then preferring the same aid package over a higher cash amount.

preferring the cash when a loan was added to the aid pack-
age. ANOVA results suggest the differences between sam-
ples are all statistically significant.
By all three measures, loan aversion appears to exist and 
at quite high rates across all three samples of respondents.
What Is the Relationship Between Different Measures of 
Loan Aversion?
For this research question, we aim to demonstrate whether 
our various measures of loan aversion are related to one 
another. Table 5 shows the correlations across the three dif-
ferent measures of loan aversion for each of the three sam-
ples. In general, our measures of loan aversion are only 
weakly correlated with one another. The Attitudes Scale and 
Borrowing for Education are correlated, with ρ of between 
0.23 and 0.25 for the high school and community college 
samples but only a value of 0.09 for the adult sample. Avoid 
Loan Packages is poorly correlated with both other measures 
across all three samples.
We hypothesize that the three measures of loan aversion 
that we describe are not highly correlated because they mea-
sure different dimensions of loan aversion in different con-
texts. For example, the Attitudes Scale combines attitudes 
toward borrowing for multiple types of purchases, including 
borrowing to buy a home and borrowing for education. 
Some respondents may be averse to borrowing to finance 
higher education (as captured in the Borrow for Education 
measure) but may not be concerned about taking out a mort-
gage in order to purchase a home. Finally, for the third mea-
sure (Avoid Loan Packages), survey respondents who did 
not appear to be loan averse when asked in the abstract about 
their attitudes toward borrowing in the Attitudes Scale or 
Borrow for Education measure may be loan averse when 
faced with the actual prospect of taking out a loan. We 
discuss this phenomenon in greater detail in the Discussion 
section.
Does Loan Aversion Vary by Demographic 
Characteristics?
In Table 6, we examine the heterogeneity of our three 
loan aversion measures across demographic characteristics 
for each sample using t tests to compare the conditional 
means. The top panel of Table 6 shows the difference in 
means from tests of the hypothesis that there is no difference 
across these student characteristics for each of our three 
measures of loan aversion for the high school sample. The 
sign of the mean difference indicates the direction of loan 
aversion for the named category (i.e., a negative sign implies 
that group is less loan averse). The middle panel displays the 
results for the community college sample, and the bottom 
panel displays the results for the adult sample. These hypoth-
esis tests suggest that there are differences in loan aversion 
across student characteristics and that these differences are 
not necessarily consistent across measures or samples. For 
example, low-income high school seniors are more likely to 
be loan averse by our first measures (although only margin-
ally significant) but not by the second or third measures. We 
find no evidence of differences in loan aversion by income 
in the other two samples. By gender, the t tests suggest that 
females are less loan averse by the Attitudes Scale and 
Borrow for Education measures in the high school and com-
munity college samples but more loan averse by the Avoid 
Loan Packages measure. In the high school and community 
college samples, respondents who report having parents that 
attended college are less loan averse than those who do not 
by the Attitudes Scale and the Borrow for Education mea-
sure. White students are notably less loan averse than 
Hispanic students across all three scales in both the high

school and community college samples, but in the adult sam-
ple, White respondents are less loan averse than Hispanic 
respondents only on the Avoid Loan Packages measure.
Although Table 6 directly answers our third research 
question and demonstrates loan aversion differs across 
demographic characteristics, conducting a regression analy-
sis to account for the partial correlations across these multi-
ple demographic characteristics may lend additional insight. 
Perhaps the result that Hispanic respondents are more loan 
averse than White respondents is actually driven by lower 
parental education or citizenship status, leading us to the 
incorrect conclusion that race is a driving factor behind loan 
aversion. Or perhaps the high school results are driven by a 
group of poor academic performers who do not envision 
pursuing higher education. Controlling for GPA mitigates 
that concern. The regression analysis presented in Table 7 
enables us to determine which characteristics are associated 
with loan aversion while controlling for all other observed 
characteristics.
After adding the full set of controls, the conditional mean 
findings for low-income and citizenship observed for the 
high school sample are attenuated, and most become insig-
nificant, but other results largely hold with our findings from 
the t tests. Female respondents are less loan averse than 
males on the Attitudes Scale, those whose parents attended 
college appear less loan averse on the Borrow for Education 
measure in the high school and community college samples, 
and Hispanic respondents are generally more loan averse 
than White students. In the high school sample, respondents 
who report having parents who attended college are

approximately 7 percentage points less likely to be loan 
averse, on average, by the Borrow for Education measure, 
and in the community college sample, they are approxi-
mately 2.5 percentage points less likely to be loan averse, on 
average. This makes sense if respondents learn about finan-
cial aid for college from their parents’ experiences. In the 
high school sample, we find that Black respondents are 
approximately 7 percentage points more likely to be loan 
averse, on average, by the Avoid Loan Packages measure 
than White students.
Hispanic respondents are more loan averse by the Avoid 
Loan Packages measure across all three of our samples. 
Across our samples, Hispanic students are between 8 and 11 
percentage points more likely to be loan averse by the Avoid 
Loan Packages measure than White students, on average. In 
both the high school and community college samples, 
Hispanic respondents are also more loan averse by the 
Attitudes Scale measure. There is no difference in the 
Borrow for Education measure.
Across samples, females exhibit less loan aversion on the 
Attitudes Scale than male students. In the high school sam-
ple, females are also slightly less loan averse on the Borrow 
for Education measure. These collective findings suggest 
women may have less loan averse attitudes, but those do not 
play out in measures more closely related to actual borrow-
ing (Avoid Loan Packages).
We also broadly note that the adjusted R-squared for each 
regression is quite low despite the inclusion of institution 
fixed effects and a host of demographic controls. This sug-
gests that, although we find several important demographic 
predictors of loan aversion, most of the variation in loan 
aversion is idiosyncratic and not explained by our observed 
demographic variables.
Discussion and Conclusion
Although policymakers and researchers speak of the exis-
tence of loan aversion and its variation across racial groups 
(Cunningham & Santiago, 2008), there is little quantitative 
research on the topic of loan aversion in the United States. In 
this study, we provide the first large-scale quantitative evi-
dence of levels of loan aversion in three different popula-
tions within the United States. We rely on three different 
measures of loan aversion to assess how measures previ-
ously used in the literature relate to one another. We find that 
loan aversion is prevalent and varies by population and race, 
with Hispanic respondents more likely to exhibit loan aver-
sion than White respondents. We also find that the three dif-
ferent measures of loan aversion that we examined were not 
highly correlated with one other, suggesting that loan aver-
sion is a complex construct with multiple dimensions and 
that it varies by context.
Our findings both extend and add to those in the extant 
literature. Because we replicated survey questions from 
Callender and Jackson (2005), our definitions of loan aver-
sion are directly comparable to prior research, albeit in a dif-
ferent context (the United States vs. United Kingdom). The 
main finding of their study is that students from lower socio-
economic groups in the United Kingdom are more loan 
averse than middle- and upper-class students. In the United 
States, we find no evidence that low-income respondents 
express greater loan-averse attitudes after controlling for 
other factors. This remains true on both of the other mea-
sures of loan aversion we employ as well as across all three 
of our samples.
Directly replicating the Avoid Loan Packages questions 
that Palameta and Voyer (2010) used to explore loan aver-
sion among a sample of study participants in Canada allows 
for another direct comparison. These authors found between 
5% and 20% of their sample (Canadian high school students 
likely to enroll in college) were loan averse. We find a much 
larger portion of all three populations in our study is loan 
averse by this same measure (between 23% and 39%). This 
difference could be attributable to higher loan aversion rates 
in the United States or higher loan aversion rates among 
people less likely to enroll in college, although we find high 
rates among community college students who are already 
enrolled in college. It is important to recognize the radically 
different cost and financing structure of attending postsec-
ondary education in the United States relative to both the 
United Kingdom and Canada, which may explain why 
American respondents are more loan averse. In addition, for 
Canadian respondents, the survey was attached to actual 
financial outcomes, which presumably elicits more accurate 
responses. However, we think it is unlikely that respondents 
have an incentive to overestimate their true avoidance of 
loan packages in our survey.
The domestic study most similar to ours relies on a sam-
ple of students currently enrolled in college and measures 
loan aversion by assessing whether students did not accept a 
loan offered to them either on a survey or in an actual finan-
cial aid package (Goldrick-Rab & Kelchen, 2013). Forty-
eight percent of that sample exhibited loan aversion by the 
authors’ measures, whereas we find high but somewhat 
lower percentages using a more diverse sample. Thirty-three 
percent of our sample of enrolled community college stu-
dents are loan averse by the Avoid Loan Packages measure. 
This difference could be attributable to regional variation 
(Wisconsin vs. Tennessee and Texas), 4-year versus 2-year 
enrollees, low-income versus middle- and upper-income stu-
dents (although we find no evidence of differences by 
income), or the slight difference in measures. Regardless, 
our findings suggest that focusing only on enrolled students 
underestimates loan aversion. Using our most direct mea-
sure, Borrow for Education, about 20% of high school 
seniors and adults who have not attended college do not 
believe it is okay to borrow money for education, a rate dou-
ble that of students already enrolled in community colleges. 
 Boatman et al.

This attitude likely contributes to some students’ avoiding 
borrowing and, in some instances, underinvesting in higher 
education by not enrolling at all.
Although the goal of this paper is not to explain why 
respondents are loan averse, we can explore a few rationales 
offered in the prior literature. First, we provide empirical 
evidence that Hispanic respondents are more likely to be 
loan averse than White respondents, even after controlling 
for a host of other observed characteristics. As cited above, 
the prior literature has frequently hinted that the observed 
differences in borrowing by race is due to loan aversion, but 
our study is the first to document this empirically at scale. 
This finding suggests there is a cultural component to the 
borrowing decision that deserves further exploration.
One of our most interesting findings is that measures of 
loan aversion used in previous literature are not highly cor-
related with one another. This finding that our three mea-
sures of loan aversion are not well correlated has implications 
for loan aversion research. First, it suggests the loan aver-
sion papers in the existing literature may not be directly 
comparable to one another. It also suggests that future loan 
aversion studies should assess loan aversion through multi-
ple measures in an effort to sort out the distinctions between 
this construct’s dimensions and capture the full extent of the 
phenomenon.
Although this study contributes to our understanding of 
loan aversion among three populations of students or 
potential students in the United States, we acknowledge 
several limitations. First, there were no stakes attached to 
our survey. As a result, respondents may not have consid-
ered each question as carefully as they would have in a 
high-stakes situation. Although this may incorporate some 
error into our measures, it is unlikely that it systematically 
biases any of our estimates. Additionally, our survey may 
be subject to sources of bias that affect its reliability. For 
example, students may not have understood all the ques-
tions, although we did try to ameliorate this problem with 
the pilot tests, and there is evidence of only a small per-
centage of respondents who misunderstood the Avoid Loan 
Packages question. Another important limitation of this 
study is that we do not observe actual higher education out-
comes for our survey respondents. A promising avenue for 
future research is to connect loan aversion measures with 
college outcomes, such as debt load and college enrollment 
and persistence. Such data would allow researchers to 
determine whether student loan aversion affects college 
enrollment and persistence. We also acknowledge that 
although the community college and adult samples are 
diverse, they were not randomly selected and may not gen-
eralize to the larger population of community college and 
adults across the United States.
Despite these limitations, our findings have important 
implications for policies related to financing higher educa-
tion. To the extent that loan aversion is driven by excessive 
risk aversion, it may be alleviated by educating students 
about forms of income-based repayment. Income-based loan 
repayment programs dramatically reduce the risk of student 
loan default by limiting the repayment amount to a small por-
tion of disposable income. Although more students are enroll-
ing in forms of income-based repayment, such as the federal 
government’s Pay as You Earn program, information about 
these forms of repayment must be presented at the time stu-
dents are considering the borrowing decision, not only at the 
time of repayment. Knowing that loan aversion exists among 
Hispanic respondents, focusing communication efforts on 
income-based repayment programs could help these prospec-
tive student populations make more informed decisions 
regarding borrowing money for college, potentially leading 
to higher rates of college-going and degree attainment. 
Additionally, policymakers and administrators may consider 
adjusting the framing of student loans by, for instance, 
removing the principal balance of the loan and relying on 
income share agreements, such as Oregon’s proposed Pay It 
Forward plan. Because it no longer requires borrowing in the 
traditional sense, loan-averse students may prefer income 
share agreements as a way to finance higher education.
Finally, policymakers may wish to consider alternatives 
to the growing reliance on student debt to finance higher 
education. One avenue to reducing the need to borrow is 
increasing public expenditures on education either through 
tuition subsidies or grant aid so that a greater proportion of 
students can finance higher education without needing to 
borrow. Several wealthy institutions, such as Princeton and 
Vanderbilt Universities, have endeavored to minimize bor-
rowing through no-loan policies that commit large sums of 
institutional grant aid to replace loans in financial aid pack-
ages. An expansion of this commitment through either pub-
lic or private financing would simultaneously relieve the 
growing debt burden and resolve loan aversion.

Notes
1. We offer several potential behavioral economics explana-
tions in this paper but acknowledge that others, such as cognitive 
overload or hyperbolic discounting, may also play a role in the 
borrowing and repayment decision process. See Boatman, Evans, 
and Soliz (2014) for further application of behavioral economics to 
student loans.
2. We consider a response unreasonable if a student preferred 
a small amount of cash to the grant (i.e., prefers $25 cash relative 
to $1,000 grant) but in a subsequent choice prefers the grant to a 
larger amount of cash (i.e., then prefers the $1,000 grant over $300

or $700 in cash). This response pattern is irrational. If a student 
rejects the higher amount of the grant for $25 cash, they should 
prefer $300 or $700 over the $1,000 grant as well.
