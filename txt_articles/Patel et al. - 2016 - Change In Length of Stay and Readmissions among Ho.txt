BACKGROUND: Changes in the medium of communica-
tion from paging to mobile secure text messaging may
change clinical care, but the effects of these changes on
patient outcomes have not been well examined.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between inpa-
tient medicine service adoption of mobile secure text mes-
saging and patient length of stay and readmissions.
DESIGN: Observational study.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to medicine services
at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (interven-
tion site; n = 8995 admissions of 6484 patients) and Penn
Presbyterian Medical Center (control site; n = 6799 admis-
sions of 4977 patients) between May 1, 2012, and April
30, 2014.
INTERVENTION: Mobile secure text messaging.
MAIN MEASURES: Change in length of stay and 30-day
readmissions, comparing patients at the intervention site
to the control site before (May 1, 2012 to April 30, 2013)
and after (May 1, 2013 to April 30, 2014) the intervention,
adjusting for time trends and patient demographics, co-
morbidities, insurance, and disposition.
KEY RESULTS: During the pre-intervention period, the
mean length of stay ranged from 4.0 to 5.0 days at the
control site and from 5.2 to 6.7 days at the intervention
site, but trends were similar. In the first month after the
intervention, the mean length of stay was unchanged at
the control site (4.7 to 4.7 days) but declined at the inter-
vention site (6.0 to 5.4 days). Trends were mostly similar
during the rest of the post-intervention period, ranging
from 4.4 to 5.6 days at the control site and from 5.4 to
6.5 days at the intervention site. Readmission rates varied
significantly within sites before and after the intervention,
but overall trends were similar. In adjusted analyses,
there was a significant decrease in length of stay for the
intervention site relative to the control site during the
post-intervention period compared to the pre-
intervention period (−0.77 days ; 95 % CI, −1.14, −0.40;
P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the odds
of readmission (OR, 0.97; 95 % CI: 0.81, 1.17; P = 0.77).
These findings were supported by multiple sensitivity
analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to a control group over time,
hospitalized medical patients on inpatient services whose
care providers and staff were offered mobile secure text
messaging showed a relative decrease in length of stay
and no change in readmissions.

INTRODUCTION
Residents spend up to one-third of their time communicating
with other health care professionals,1 and inadequate commu-
nication can lead to errors and delays.2–4 Much of this com-
munication has shifted mediums from handwritten notes and
face-to-face conversations to mobile platforms such as email
and text messaging.5 These technologies offer ease, but their
effect on clinical outcomes is unknown.
The shift to mobile communication channels in the health
care setting have been spurred by the rapid adoption of
smartphones.5 However, many email clients and short mes-
sage services (SMS) send patient health information through
an unsecured cellular network, putting patient privacy at
risk.6,7 Many hospitals still require providers to use online
paging systems, which are also often not secure, have limited
mobile access, and require either a synchronous phone call or
face-to-face interaction in order to close the loop on the
intended communication. Mobile secure text messaging may
help to address these issues by encrypting messages and
allowing for rapid, asynchronous two-way (or larger group)
exchanges of information that may better fit within the clinical
workflow.
Several studies suggest that when mobile secure text mes-
saging is available, it is widely used and is perceived to
improve communication.8,9 However, its clinical impact has

 not been examined.9 We hypothesized that the use of mobile
secure messaging would improve the flow of communication
within the hospital, thereby leading to faster coordination of
care and shorter length of stay. If these discharges were ap-
propriate, we would then hypothesize that there should no
increase in readmissions. The objective of this study was to
evaluate the association between inpatient medicine service
adoption of mobile secure text messaging and changes in
length of stay and readmissions among hospitalized medical
patients.
METHODS
This study was approved by the University of Pennsylvania
institutional review board. Informed consent was waived be-
cause the study posed minimal risk to patients.
Study Sample
The sample comprised adults admitted between May 1, 2012,
and April 30, 2014, to two inpatient medicine floors at the
Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (intervention site)
and two inpatient medicine floors at Penn Presbyterian
Medical Center (control site) in Philadelphia. Each of these
floors was a teaching service with teams of attending physi-
cians, residents, and interns that admitted general medicine,
gastroenterology, infectious disease, nephrology, and pulmo-
nary patients. The two hospitals share the same house staff and
electronic record, and are located in the same ZIP code less
than a mile apart. Discharges against medical advice (n=329),
to hospice (n=325), or by death (n=60) were excluded from
the sample, because while they may impact outcome measure
values, they were not changing differentially between sites
over time.
Intervention
Prior to the intervention, providers in both hospitals used a
computer Internet browser to send one-way alphanumeric
messages through a paging system. Providers were not able
to directly acknowledge or reply to these text messages.
Instead, providers either had to log into a computer to send a
response or discuss via phone or face-to-face. This method
was continued at the control site during the intervention peri-
od. In May 2013, all providers and staff (attending physicians,
residents, nurses, pharmacists, social workers, clinical re-
source coordinators, and unit secretaries) on two inpatient
medicine floors at the intervention site were instructed to use
a smartphone-based secure text messaging application
(Cureatr Inc., New York, NY, USA) to communicate patient
information and to help facilitate medical decision making.
Providers could use an iPhone or Android smartphone to
access the application. Those without a smartphone were
given an iPhone or iPod touch to use while working on the
floor. The application was also accessible online from a
computer browser. The secure messaging application
encrypted text before it was sent via a cellular or wireless
Internet connection, and decrypted text before it was viewed.
Senders could see when their recipients read the message, and
recipients could reply directly using the application. This
technology was not offered at the control site, which continued
to use the one-way paging system.
Main Outcome Measures
The main outcome measures were inpatient length of stay and
30-day readmissions. Length of stay was defined as the time
from hospital admission to discharge either home or to another
institution (e.g. skilled nursing facility). Readmissions were
defined as unplanned readmissions, excluding scheduled visits
such as inpatient elective surgery and chemotherapy and un-
planned but anticipated admissions for childbirth and organ
transplantation. Data on admissions to other hospitals were not
available, and thus we were only able to assess readmissions to
the hospital of the initial admission.
Data
Patient information including admissions, discharges, demo-
graphics, comorbidities, and readmissions was obtained using
health insurance claims from the billing system at the
University of Pennsylvania Health System. Utilization of mo-
bile secure messaging was retrieved from the Cureatr platform,
which reveals the number of messages sent and received by
each role.
Statistical Analysis
We used a multiple time-series research design,10–13 also
known as difference-in-differences, to compare within-site
pre- and post-intervention outcomes between sites where the
secure messaging was offered and where it was not. While
some opportunity for residual confounding remains, this ap-
proach reduces potential biases from unmeasured variables
from three possible sources.11,14,15 First, a difference between
hospitals that is stable over time cannot be mistaken for an
effect of the intervention, because hospital fixed effects are
used to compare each hospital with itself before and after the
intervention. Second, changes affecting both hospitals similar-
ly, such as technological improvements or pay-for-
performance initiatives, cannot be mistaken for an effect,
because the regression models use time fixed effects. Third,
if the patient mix changes differently between hospitals, and if
these changes are accurately reflected in the measured risk
factors, this cannot be mistaken for an effect of the interven-
tion, because the regression models adjust for these measured
risk factors. In addition, if outcomes in the pre-intervention
period are changing in parallel, it allows us to evaluate diverg-
ing trends in the post-intervention period that might indicate
whether there was an association between the change in out-
come and the intervention.

 Similar to prior work,12,13 a multivariate logistic model
was fit to the binary outcome of 30-day readmissions,
and a multivariate linear regression model was fit to the
continuous outcome of length of stay in days using the
hospital admission as the unit of analysis. The models
used data from May 1, 2012, to April 30, 2014, and were
adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, insurance status,
and disposition. They were also risk-adjusted for patient
comorbidity severity using the Charlson Comorbidity
Index (CCI), which predicts 10-year mortality.16 We used
calendar-month fixed effects by creating a binary variable
for each of the 12 calendar months. Since there were
24 months during the study period, this ensured that a
change due to seasonal factors (e.g. in July when new
interns begin) could not be mistaken for an effect of the
intervention. Each patient visit was attributed to the
month in which the day of admission occurred. We
created a binary time variable to indicate either the pre-
intervention or post-intervention period and a binary site
variable to indicate either the control or intervention site.
The effect of the intervention was evaluated using inter-
action terms for each calendar month, time (post-
intervention period), and site. Standard errors in the
models were adjusted to account for clustering by pa-
tient.17,18 To assess the mean effect of the intervention in
the post-intervention period, we exponentiated the mean
of the monthly log odds ratios for the 30-day
readmissions measure and computed a linear combination
of monthly interaction estimates for length of stay.19,20
For both measures, a test of controls was conducted to
test the null hypothesis of parallel trends during the pre-
intervention period. We also tested the null hypothesis of
parallel trends in patient comorbidity severity between
the two sites before and after the intervention period

 using the CCI. An inability to reject the null hypothesis
in this test supports the notion that any effects observed
after the intervention were less likely to be due to dif-
ferential shifts in comorbidity severity between the two
sites. All hypothesis tests were two-sided and used a
significance level of P <0.05. All statistical analyses
were conducted using Stata version 12.1 software
(StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).
To evaluate the robustness of our model estimates, we
performed several independent sensitivity analyses. First,
we estimated the models using fixed effects by within-
hospital location to adjust for variability that may have
occurred within the same hospital but on different med-
icine floors. Second, we estimated the models using only
each patient’s first admission to ensure that a subset of
high utilizers was not driving the overall changes in
outcomes. Third, while the main models used the CCI
to adjust for patient disease severity, we also estimated
the models adjusting for changes in the rates of patient
comorbidities using a binary term for each condition.
Fourth, for the outcome of length of stay, we estimated
the model using a gamma regression, which may better
fit data with positive skew.21 Fifth, we estimated the
change in median length of stay using a quantile regres-
sion model.22,23 A change in median length of stay may
indicate that changes are not just attributable to decreases
in longer lengths of stay, but also to changes in shorter
lengths of stay.
RESULTS
The study sample comprised 4977 patients with 6799
admissions at the control site and 6484 patients with
8995 admissions at the intervention site. Table 1 shows
patient characteristics and comorbidities, which were
similar within sites before and after the intervention. A
test of the CCI could not reject the null hypothesis of
parallel trends in patient comorbidity severity between
hospital sites before and after the intervention (−0.10;
95 % CI: − 0.23, 0.02; P = 0.11).
During the intervention period, there were 446,342
secure messages sent, of which 377,347 were individual
messages and 68,995 were group (>1 recipient)

 messages. The highest volume was among residents
(167,405 messages; 37.5 % of all messages) and nurses
(177,184; 39.7 %), followed by social workers and clin-
ical research coordinators (35,594; 8.0 %), attending
physicians (34,926; 7.8 %), pharmacists (26,434;
5.9 %), and unit secretaries (4,799; 1.1 %).
Unadjusted monthly trends in mean length of stay are
displayed by hospital site in Figure 1. During the pre-
intervention period, the mean length of stay ranged from
4.0 to 5.0 days at the control site and from 5.2 to 6.7 days
at the intervention site. A test of controls for the pre-
intervention period could not reject the null hypothesis of
parallel trends in length of stay at the two sites
(0.01 days; 95 % confidence interval [CI], −0.73, 0.75,
P = 0.98). In the first month after the intervention, the
mean length of stay was unchanged at the control site
(4.7 to 4.7 days) but declined at the intervention site (6.0
to 5.4 days). Trends were largely similar during the rest
of the post-intervention period, ranging from 4.4 to
5.6 days at the control site and from 5.4 to 6.5 days at
the intervention site.
Unadjusted monthly trends in the readmissions rate are
displayed by hospital site in Figure 2. During the pre-
intervention period, the readmission rates ranged from 8.0 to
15.1 % at the control site and 11.1 to 19.0 % at the intervention
site. A test of controls for the pre-intervention period could not
reject the null hypothesis of parallel trends in readmissions at
the two sites (odds ratio [OR]: 1.11; 95 % CI, 0.72, 1.70,
P=0.65). During the post-intervention period, the readmission
rates ranged from 9.5 to 15.5 % at the control site and 11.8 to
17.9 % at the intervention site.
In adjusted analyses, the annual mean length of stay was
unchanged at the intervention site from before to after interven-
tion, whereas it increased at the control site in the post-
intervention period, representing a significant relative reduction
associated with implementation of mobile secure text messag-
ing (−0.77 days ; 95 % CI, −1.14, −0.40; P<0.001). Findings
were sustained in each of the sensitivity analyses, gamma
regression model, and quantile regression model (Table 2).
There was no significant difference in the odds of readmissions
(OR, 0.97; 95 % CI: 0.81, 1.17; P=0.77). Findings were
sustained in each of the sensitivity analyses (Table 3).

 DISCUSSION
It is important to recognize that changes to the medium of
communication—for example, moving from face-to-face to
telephone, or from telephone to mobile secure text
messaging—change the effects of the messages. Because
communication is so central to effective health care, the recent
transformation of communication more generally has the po-
tential to greatly affect clinical care, with the consequent need
to evaluate new communication methods in health care just as
we might evaluate new drugs, new insurance benefit designs,
or new payment policies. To our knowledge, this is one of the
first evaluations of patient care outcomes after the use of
mobile secure text messaging.
We found that adoption of this mobile technology was
associated with a significant relative reduction in length of
stay after adjusting for time trends and patient demographics,
comorbidities, insurance, and disposition. This result makes
sense, because texting is perceived to facilitate communica-
tion, and we hypothesized that improved communication
might accelerate care coordination. Based on the models, this
intervention resulted in about a 0.77-day or 14 % relative
decrease in length of stay.
The most significant comparative reduction in length of stay
occurred immediately after the intervention. In the first month,
mean length of stay was unchanged at the control site (from
4.7 to 4.7 days) but decreased at the intervention site (from 6.0
to 5.4 days). This observation of immediate effects suggest
that the mechanism was immediate—perhaps, as postulated,
because more effective communication among the care
team reduced delays in medical decision making or
helped expedite discharge plans. It should be noted that
mean length of stay at the annual level was unchanged
at the intervention site and increased at the control site.
While we were unable to adjust for staff and hospital
characteristics, there are several indications to suggest
this change may have been attributable to the interven-
tion. First, in the prior 12 months, mean length of stay
differed between the two sites but changed similarly, as
indicated by the parallel trends test. It was not until the
first month after the intervention that these trends di-
verged. Second, aside from mobile secure text messag-
ing, we know of no hospital or floor-based changes at
either site occurring in May 2013 that could have
accounted for such an effect on patient length of stay.
Finally, these changes occurred before the time of resi-
dent turnover (June to July), and our model used
calendar-month fixed effects, so these changes were
likely not due to seasonal trends. Thus, while the abso-
lute site-specific changes over time should be consid-
ered, it is important to interpret the findings according

intervention period versus the pre-intervention period

attributable to reductions in longer lengths of stay, but also to changes in shorter lengths of stay

 to the difference in changes in outcomes between the
two sites over time.
If shorter lengths of stays meant that patients were
discharged too early, we might expect to find an increase in
readmissions. The observation that mobile secure text mes-
saging is associated with substantially shorter length of stay
but no increase in readmissions suggests a relatively unqual-
ified benefit.24–26 These results were consistent across multi-
ple sensitivity analyses.
Our findings have important implications for hospitals and
residency programs. Many hospitals still rely on paging sys-
tems that allow for only one-way alphanumeric messaging,
have limited mobile capabilities, and may be less efficient
within clinical workflow. Many providers may still use mobile
channels for communication such as email and SMS text
messages, but these channels are often not secure and not
compliant with the standards set forth in the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).27,28
Mobile secure text messaging can address many of these
issues and allow for additional functionality to improve com-
munication, including message acknowledgment, the ability
to add or remove select individuals in a group message, or the
ability to send an urgent response to a message. Similar to
prior studies,8,9 we found high utilization of mobile secure
messaging. The engagement of both physicians and staff may
have created increased opportunities to improve communica-
tion towards more efficient workflow. Future studies to further
understand the relationship between mobile secure text mes-
saging and patient outcomes might use a prospective random-
ized intervention design and include qualitative analyses
among key stakeholders.
This study is subject to several limitations. First, any
observational study is susceptible to unmeasured con-
founders. However, the comparison of outcomes over time
between the intervention and control sites diminished the
potential bias from unmeasured confounding. While we
were not able to address serial correlation in our model,
the small number of groups and time periods suggests that
this was less likely to bias our results.29–31 Second, our
findings are from hospitalized medical patients at a single
health system, which may limit generalizability to other
settings. Third, we did not have data to evaluate
readmissions to hospitals other than those in this study.
Fourth, length of stay and readmissions—while closely
watched—are limited indicators of health care cost and
quality. We were unable to adequately evaluate changes in
mortality due to the low number of inpatient deaths in this
patient sample. Finally, we evaluated outcomes associated
with use of one mobile secure text messaging application.
While many of the features of this technology are similar
to those of other secure text messaging applications, more
study is needed using other forms of this technology.
In conclusion, compared to a control group over time,
hospitalized medical patients on inpatient services whose care
providers and staff were offered mobile secure text messaging
saw a relative decrease in length of stay and no change in
readmissions.
