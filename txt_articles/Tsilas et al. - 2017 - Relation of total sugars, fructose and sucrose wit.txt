S
ugars, particularly fructose-containing sugars, have been 
implicated as an important driver in the rise in incidence of 
type 2 diabetes.1,2 Sugar-sweetened beverages, which rep-
resent the greatest source of fructose-containing sugars in the 
diet,3 form most of the basis for this link.4,5 It remains unclear 
whether the association between beverages sweetened with sug-
ars and type 2 diabetes can be explained by the fructose that these 
beverages contain. Several high-quality systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses have assessed the relation of sugar-sweetened 
beverages with incident type 2 diabetes. Our objective was to con-
duct a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort 
studies to determine the role of fructose-containing sugars inde-
pendent of food form in the development of type 2 diabetes.
Methods
Our systematic review and meta-analysis followed the Cochrane 
Handbook for Systematic Reviews and Interventions,6 and 
reported results according to Meta-analysis of Observational Stud-
ies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guideline7 and PRISMA guideline 
(www.prisma-statement.org). The study protocol is registered 
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT01608620).

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Sugar-sweetened bever-
ages are associated with type 2 diabetes. 
To assess whether this association holds 
for the fructose-containing sugars they 
contain, we conducted a systematic 
review and meta-analysis of prospective 
cohort studies.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, 
Embase, CINAHL and the Cochrane 
Library (through June 2016). We included 
prospective cohort studies that assessed 
the relation of fructose-containing sugars 
with incident type 2 diabetes. Two inde-
pendent reviewers extracted relevant 
data and assessed risk of bias. We pooled 
risk ratios (RRs) using random effects 
meta-analyses. The overall quality of the 
evidence was assessed using the Grading 
of Recommendations Assessment, Devel-
opment and Evaluation (GRADE) system.
RESULTS: Fifteen prospective cohort stud-
ies (251 261 unique participants, 16 416 
cases) met the eligibility criteria, comparing 
the highest intake (median 137, 35.2 and 
78 g/d) with the lowest intake (median 65, 
9.7 and 25.8 g/d) of total sugars, fructose 
and sucrose, respectively. Although there 
was no association of total sugars (RR 0.91, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76–1.09) or 
fructose (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84–1.29) with 
type 2 diabetes, sucrose was associated 
with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes 
(RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80–0.98). Our confi-
dence in the estimates was limited by evi-
dence of serious inconsistency between 
studies for total sugars and fructose, and 
serious imprecision in the pooled esti-
mates for all 3 sugar categories.
INTERPRETATION: Current evidence does 
not allow us to conclude that fructose-
containing sugars independent of food 
form are associated with increased risk of 
type 2 diabetes. Further research is likely 
to affect our estimates. Trial registration:

Data sources and searches
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and the Cochrane 
Library databases through June 2016. The search strategy is pre-
sented in supplementary Table 1 (Appendix 1, available at www.
cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.160706/-/DC1). The 
search was restricted to human studies without language restric-
tions. Manual searches of the reference lists of included studies 
supplemented electronic searches.
Study selection
We included prospective cohort studies that assessed intake of 
fructose-containing sugars (total sugars, fructose, sucrose, high-
fructose corn syrup or added sugars) and incident type 2 diabe-
tes in participants who did not have diabetes.
Data extraction
Two reviewers (C.T. and R.T.) independently extracted relevant 
data from included studies. The main outcome was type 2 diabe-
tes risk expressed as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence inter-
vals (CI). Authors were contacted for missing data.
Risk of bias
The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the risk of 
bias in included studies, where up to 9 points were awarded 
based on cohort selection, comparability (adjustments) and 
ascertainment of the outcome.8 Owing to concerns regarding the 
use of cut-off scores,6 we did not use our prespecified cut-off 
score for NOS.9 Differences were reconciled by consensus.
Grading of the evidence
The quality and strength of the evidence was assessed using the 
Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and 
Evaluation (GRADE) system.10–22 Included observational studies 
started at low-quality evidence by default and then were down-
graded or upgraded based on prespecified criteria. Criteria to 
downgrade included study limitations (weight of studies showed 
risk of bias by NOS), inconsistency (substantial unexplained inter-
study heterogeneity, I2 > 50% and p < 0.10), indirectness (presence 
of factors relating to the population, exposures and outcomes 
that limit generalizability), imprecision (95% CIs were wide or 
crossed a minimally important difference of 10% [RR 0.9–1.1]) and 
publication bias (significant evidence of small-study effects). Cri-
teria to upgrade included a large size effect (RR > 2 or RR < 0.5 in 
the absence of plausible confounders), a dose–response gradient 
and attenuation by plausible confounding effects.
Statistical analysis
To obtain summary estimates, we natural log-transformed and 
pooled the RRs using the generic inverse variance method with 
random-effects models. We used RRs comparing extreme quan-

tiles and scaled RRs per 100 g/d for total sugars, 50 g/d for fruc-
tose and 50 g/d for sucrose to standardize the doses based on 
estimated average intakes in Canada.23 Heterogeneity was 
assessed (Cochran Q statistic) and quantified (I2 statistic). If I2 was 
greater than or equal to 50%, we interpreted this as indicating 
substantial heterogeneity.6,16 We investigated possible sources of 
heterogeneity. To assess whether any single study exerted an 
undue influence on the summary estimates, we performed sensi-
tivity analyses by systematically removing each study with recal-
culation of the summary estimates. We performed additional sen-
sitivity analyses by restricting pooled analyses to studies using 
validated measures of sugars intake to assess any influence of 
how the exposures were assessed. Prespecified subgroup analy-
ses were done by sex, follow-up, NOS and individual domains of 
NOS using meta-regression analyses. Linear and nonlinear dose–
response analyses were assessed by using generalized least 
squares trend (GLST) estimation models and spline curve model-
ling (MKSPLINE procedure). If 10 or more cohort comparisons 
were available, we investigated publication bias by visual inspec-
tion of funnel plots and using the Begg and Egger tests. Data were 
analyzed using Review Manager (RevMan) version 5.2 (The Nordic 
Cochrane Centre) and Stata version 12 (StataCorp).
Results
Figure 1 shows the flow of the literature search. Out of 8381 reports, 
we included 9 reports of 15 cohort studies involving 251 261 unique 
participants and 16 416 cases of type 2 diabetes:24–32 12 cohort com-
parisons (n = 105 846, 13 727 cases) for total sugars, 6 cohort compari-
sons (n = 107 972, 3833 cases) for fructose and 8 cohort comparisons 
(n = 192 332, 4535 cases) for sucrose. There were no cohort compari-
sons available for high-fructose corn syrup or added sugars.

ticipants were from 11 countries and had a median age of

52.6 years (interquartile range [IQR] 20–79 yr). There were more 
female than male participants, with 4 large female cohorts and 
11 smaller mixed cohorts. Median follow-up was 12 years (IQR 
4–12 yr), 6.3 years (IQR 6–12 yr) and 6.2 years (IQR 6–12 yr) for 
total sugars, fructose and sucrose, respectively. Ascertainment of 
incident cases was done by medical record linkage (60%), self-
report (27%) and physician diagnosis (13%).
Median intakes for total sugars, fructose and sucrose were 
65 g/d (IQR 25.8–100 g/d), 9.7 g/d (IQR 6–25.8 g/d) and 25.8 g/d 
(IQR 22.5–28.5 g/d), respectively, in the lowest quantile of intake. 
In the highest quantile of intake, median intakes for total sugars, 
fructose and sucrose were 137 g/d (IQR 57.2–194.4 g/d), 35.2 g/d 
(IQR 28.8–57.2 g/d) and 78 g/d (IQR 57.2–102 g/d), respectively. 
Dietary intake was assessed by food frequency questionnaires, 
semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires (47%), quantita-
tive dietary questionnaires (20%) or mixed methods (33%). No 
studies differentiated between added sugars and naturally 
occurring sugars.
Funding sources did not include industry funding. Thirteen 
studies reported funding from agency alone, whereas the other 2 
studies did not report funding sources.
Supplementary Table 2 (Appendix 1) shows the statistical 
adjustments performed in the included studies. All studies 
adjusted for the prespecified primary confounding variable (age) 
and adjusted for at least 4 of 5 secondary confounding variables 
(markers of overweight/obesity, family history of diabetes, 
energy intake, physical activity, sex).
Supplementary Table 3 (Appendix 1) shows the NOS scores 
for the included studies. Although several studies lost points for 
selection and outcome assessment, there was no evidence of 
serious risk of bias across the included studies.
Visual inspection of funnel plots (Supplementary Figure 18, 
Appendix 1), and formal testing with the Begg (p = 0.7) and Egger 
tests (p = 0.4) did not show evidence of publication bias for total 
sugars. Publication bias was not assessed for fructose and 
sucrose because there were less than 10 cohort comparisons.
Supplementary Table 4 (Appendix 1) shows a summary of the 
GRADE assessments for the association of total sugars, fructose 
and sucrose intake with incident type 2 diabetes. The evidence 
for a lack of harm was rated as very low quality for total sugars 
and fructose because of downgrades for serious inconsistency 
and imprecision, and low quality for sucrose because of a down-
grade for serious imprecision and an upgrade for a significant 
inverse dose–response gradient.

0.98) with no evidence of heterogeneity (I2 = 1%, p = 0.4) when we 
compared the highest and the lowest levels of intake. Risk ratio 
per 50 g/d intake was 0.91 (95% CI 0.83–1.00), with no evidence 
of heterogeneity (I2 = 12%, p = 0.34).
Additional analyses
The systematic removal of each study did not modify the lack of 
an association for total sugars or fructose. However, the removal 
of the study by Hodge and colleagues27 (I2 = 9%, p = 0.4) in the 
analysis of total sugars and the study by Ahmadi-Abhari and col-
leagues32 (I2 = 40%, p = 0.2) in the fructose analysis did explain 
away most of the evidence of heterogeneity. The inverse associa-
tion for sucrose was lost through the systematic removal of the 
studies by Colditz and colleagues24 (high body mass index cohort 
comparison; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79–1.01), Meyer and colleagues25 
(RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.81–1.04), Janket and colleagues26 (RR 0.91, 
95% CI 0.80–1.03), Schulze and colleagues30 (cohort comparison 
of males; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81–1.01) or Ahmadi-Abhari and col-
leagues32 (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79–1.01). However, the recalculated 
95% CI did not include evidence of clinically important harm.
Restricting analyses to studies in which sugars were assessed 
using validated measures neither modified the associations nor 
the evidence of heterogeneity for total sugars, fructose or 
sucrose (supplementary Figures 4–6, Appendix 1).
Supplementary Figures 7–12 (Appendix 1) provide the a priori 
subgroup analyses. There was no evidence of effect modification 
for the associations of total sugars, fructose and sucrose with 
incident type 2 diabetes in a priori subgroup analyses. Any evi-
dence of significant interstudy heterogeneity was not explained 
by a priori subgroup analyses.
There was no evidence of a dose–response gradient for total 
sugars or fructose using GLST estimation (supplementary Fig-
ures 13 and 14, Appendix 1). No dose–response gradient or dose 
thresholds for fructose was seen using the MKSPLINE procedure 
(supplementary Figure 15, Appendix 1), whereas total sugars 
could not be modelled because of insufficient data. Results of 
GLST estimation for sucrose showed evidence of a significant 
inverse relationship with incident type 2 diabetes per 25 g/d 
intake (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85–0.99, p = 0.03) (supplementary Figure 
16, Appendix 1), but this relation was not seen for results using 
the MKSPLINE procedure (supplementary Figure 17, Appendix 1).
Interpretation
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospec-
tive cohort studies of the relation between intake of sugars and 
incident type 2 diabetes. Pooled analyses showed that intakes of 
total sugars and fructose were not associated with type 2 diabe-
tes, whereas intake of sucrose was associated with an 11% 
decrease in type 2 diabetes.
Our results do not support a hypothesis that the positive 
association seen between sugar-sweetened beverages and dia-
betes is mediated by the fructose-containing sugars they con-
tain. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that 
sugar-sweetened beverages are associated with an increase in 
the risk of type 2 diabetes.4,5,33 Our pooled analyses failed to 
show a similar increase despite the inclusion of data from mostly 
the same set of cohorts.
The lack of an adverse association is difficult to reconcile with the 
biological mechanisms and ecological observations linking fructose-

containing sugars to type 2 diabetes.34–39 It is also difficult to reconcile 
with our earlier systematic review and meta-analysis showing a posi-
tive association between fructose intake and gout,9 given the emerg-
ing links between uric acid and diabetes.37 One possible explanation 
for the lack of agreement is residual confounding from reverse cau-
sality. People at high risk of type 2 diabetes may avoid sugars as a 
preventive strategy, which decreases the risk associated with intake 
of total sugars, fructose or sucrose. Another explanation may relate 
to the increased intake of healthier food sources of sugars other than 
sugar-sweetened beverages, which themselves show null or protec-
tive associations with type 2 diabetes.
Although sugar-sweetened beverages are sources of most 
fructose-containing sugars in Canadian and American diets, 
other sources contribute meaningfully to overall intake23,40 (e.g., 
grains and grain products, fruit and fruit products, and dairy and 
dairy products).23,40 Many of these other food sources, which tend 
to be sweetened with sucrose, have either shown no association 
(e.g., cakes and cookies,41 and sherbert42) or a protective associa-
tion (e.g., whole-grain cereals, fruit, yogurt and even ice cream42–
44) with type 2 diabetes (Appendix 2, available at www.cmaj.ca/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.160706/-/DC1). An inverse dose–
response gradient, similar to that for sucrose, has even been 
found for whole-grain cereals, fruit and yogurt.42–44 Taken 
together, lack of an adverse association between intakes of total 
sugars, fructose or sucrose and diabetes may reflect important 
contributions from these other food sources.
In the absence of a particular adverse association between 
 
fructose-containing sugars and incident diabetes, one must con-
sider alternative explanations for the observed association 
between sugar-sweetened beverages and diabetes. One explana-
tion may relate to uncompensated energy. Systematic reviews 
and meta-analyses of controlled feeding trials45–51 have shown 
that the adverse effect of sugars on cardiometabolic risk factors is 
mediated by excess energy, with a signal for harm largely 
restricted to comparisons in which sugars supplement back-
ground diets with excess energy. It is possible that the food form 
of sugar-sweetened beverages promotes the excess energy 
intake. Evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses of 
acute preload trials have shown that sugars in liquid form elicit a 
weaker satiety response and are less compensated by a decrease 
in energy intake at subsequent meals than sugars in solid form,52 
a mechanism that might contribute to weight gain and type 2 dia-
betes.53–55 Another possibility is that sugar-sweetened beverages 
are a marker of an unhealthy lifestyle.56–59 High consumers of 
sugar-sweetened beverages consume more energy, take less 
physical activity and smoke more,60–62 all of which may be difficult 
to measure and adjust for in observational studies.63
Strengths and limitations
The strengths of our study are that we identified all available pro-
spective cohorts through a systematic search strategy, performed 
quantitative syntheses and conducted an assessment of the quality 
and strength of the evidence by using the GRADE assessment.
Despite the inclusion of several large, high-quality cohorts, 
the inability to rule out residual confounding is a limitation inher-
ent in all observational studies, and a reason that observational 
studies start at low quality by GRADE. Sources of residual con-
founding include reverse causality, the reliability of self-report 
intake64 and measurement of the exposure to sugars, measured 
and unmeasured confounders included in statistical models, and 
important collinearity effects from related dietary and lifestyle 
patterns. Another important limitation is inconsistency between 
studies. Although the evidence for heterogeneity was partially 
explained by the removal of several individual studies during 
sensitivity analyses, residual inconsistency could not be ruled 
out for total sugars and fructose. A final limitation is the impreci-
sion in the estimates of pooled risk. The 95% CIs were wide and 
could not rule out clinically important benefit or harm for total 
sugars and fructose. In addition, there was some instability in the 
precision of the summary estimates for sucrose.
Balancing the strengths and weaknesses, the evidence was 
assessed as very low quality for total sugars and fructose, which 
was based on downgrades for inconsistency and imprecision, 
and low quality for sucrose, because of the combination of a 
downgrade for imprecision and an upgrade for an inverse dose–
response gradient. In comparison, the evidence for the associa-
tion between intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and type 2 
diabetes4,5 would similarly be assessed by GRADE as low quality 
based on the combination of a downgrade for inconsistency and 
an upgrade for a positive dose–response gradient.
Conclusion
Our systematic review and meta-analysis of available prospective 
cohort studies does not support an adverse association between 
intake of fructose-containing sugars independent of food form 
and risk of type 2 diabetes. Our confidence in the evidence for this 
conclusion is generally weak. Sources of uncertainty include the 
risk of residual confounding in observational studies that prevent 
causal inferences from being drawn, serious inconsistency 
between studies and imprecision in estimates of pooled risk for 
total sugars and fructose, and serious imprecision in estimates of 
pooled risk for sucrose. Although our observation of a negative 
dose–response gradient between sucrose and incident diabetes 
might strengthen our confidence in the lack of harm associated 
with sucrose, more research is likely to have an important effect 
on our estimates. In the absence of a clear signal for harm, sugars 
alone do not appear to explain the relation between sugar-sweet-
ened beverages and type 2 diabetes. More “food-based” research 
is needed to assess whether the same relation holds for other 
important food sources of sugars, such as grain and grain-based 
products, fruit and fruit products, and dairy and dairy products.
