The histiocytoses are rare disorders char-
acterized by the accumulation of macro-
phage, dendritic cell, or monocyte-derived
cells in various tissues and organs of chil-
dren and adults. More than 100 different
subtypes have been described, with a wide
range of clinical manifestations, presenta-
tions, and histologies. Since the first classi-
fication in 1987, a number of new findings
regarding the cellular origins, molecular
pathology, and clinical features of histio-
cytic disorders have been identified. We
propose herein a revision of the classifica-
tion of histiocytoses based on histology,
phenotype, molecular alterations, and clin-
ical and imaging characteristics. This re-
vised classification system consists of 5
groups of diseases: (1) Langerhans-related,
(2) cutaneous and mucocutaneous, and (3)
malignanthistiocytosesaswellas(4)Rosai-
Dorfman disease and (5) hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis and macrophage acti-
vation syndrome. Herein, we provide guide-
lines and recommendations for diagnoses
of these disorders. (Blood. 2016;127(22):
2672-2681)
Introduction
The histiocytoses are rare disorders characterized by the accumu-
lation of cells thought to be derived from dendritic cells (DCs)
or macrophages. Their clinical behavior ranges from mild to
disseminated and, sometimes, life-threatening forms. The first
classification of histiocytosis, published in 1987 by the Working
Group of the Histiocyte Society (HS),1 consisted of 3 categories:
Langerhans cell (LC) or non-LC-related, and malignant histiocy-
toses (MH). In light of recent insights, we propose to parsimoni-
ously gather the large number of categories of histiocytic disorders
into 5 groups (Figure 1; supplemental Methods, available on the
Blood Web site) based on clinical, radiographic, pathological,
phenotypic, genetic, and/or molecular features.
Histiocyte and dendritic cell lineages
DCs, monocytes, and macrophages are members of the mononuclear
phagocyte system,2 whereas a histiocyte is a morphological term refer-
ring to tissue-resident macrophages. Macrophages are large ovoid
cells mainly involved in the clearance of apoptotic cells, debris, and
pathogens. In contrast, DCs are starry cells that present antigens on
major histocompatibility complex molecules and activate naive
T lymphocytes.3 Human DCs are classified into 2 main groups:
plasmacytoid and myeloid (mDC). mDCs have been further subdi-
vided into 2 subsets on the basis of their expression of CD141 (mDC1)
and CD1c (mDC2). LCs are DCs localized within the epidermis,

 mucosae, or bronchial epithelium, expressing CD1a and containing
Birbeckgranules.Whenactivatedbylocalinflammation,LCsmigrateto
draining lymph nodes and differentiate into interdigitating cells (IDCs).
Blood monocytes are classified into 3 subgroups depending on
CD14 and CD16 expression. In vitro, monocytes may differentiate into
any cell type of the mononuclear phagocyte system, and probably also
in vivo, during inflammatory conditions. However, under normal
conditions, several macrophage and DC subpopulations, including
LCs, are self-renewing.
The “L” (Langerhans) group
TheLangerhans/non-Langerhansdichotomynotedinpriorclassificationof
histiocytoses has become questionable as nearly 20% of patients with
Erdheim-Chesterdisease(ECD)alsohaveLChistiocytosis(LCH)lesions.4
Furthermore, both diseases have clonal mutations involving genes of the
MAPK pathway in .80% of cases.5-8 Blood monocytes harboring the
same mutations as pathological histiocytes have been reported in both
diseases.7,8 In addition, both conditions may be associated with similar
clinical complications such as diabetes insipidus and/or neurodegenerative
disease. Thus, we propose to include LCH, ECD, and extracutaneous
juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG) in a single group (Table 1).
Langerhans cell histiocytosis
LCH includes a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations in children
and adults, ranging from self-healing lesions to life-threatening dis-
seminated disease. The diagnosis of LCH is based on clinical and
radiological findings in combination with histopathological analyses
identifying tissue infiltration by histiocytes with ultrastructural or im-
munophenotypic characteristics of LCs. It is recommended that biopsy
confirmation of suspected LCH be performed in all cases, especially
for patients requiring therapy (grade C2).
TheannualincidenceofLCHinchildrenyoungerthan15yearsofage
is around 5 to 9/106 and 1/106 in patients older than 15 years of age.9,10
Rare cases of familial LCH have been reported,11 but no genetic sus-
ceptibility has been identified to date. Lung LCH of the adult is strongly
associated with smoking.12

 LCH may affect any organ of the body, but those more frequently
affected in children are the bones (80% of cases), skin (33%) (Figure 2),
and the pituitary gland (25%), liver, spleen, hematopoietic system or
lungs (15% each) (Figure 2), lymph nodes (5%-10%), or the central
nervous system (CNS) (2%-4% excluding the pituitary).13 In adults,
lung involvement is more frequent than in children.
Biopsies should be fixed in buffered formalin ,72 hours, to allow
for histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and molecular analyses
(gradeB2).PathologichistiocytesinLCHaremononucleatedcellswith
coffee bean– or kidney-shaped nuclei. Detection of LC markers is
mandatory to confirm the diagnosis. In routine practice, detection of
Birbeck granules by electron microscopy has been widely replaced by
detection of CD1a and CD207 expression, which can be performed on
formalin-fixedsamples.14LCHcellsareoftenassociatedwithabundant
eosinophils and multinucleated giant cells.
In the diagnostic workup of LCH, several diagnoses should be
excluded, depending on the anatomic localization of the disease.15
Differentialpathologicaldiagnosiswithindeterminatecellhistiocytosis
(ICH) is based on the absence of CD207 expression on this latter entity.
ICH is a very rare entity, with similar clinical presentation, that may
have BRAF mutations.16 The recent discovery of ETV3-NCOA2
translocations in 3 cases of ICH suggests that (1) this fusion may be
highly specific for ICH and (2) ICH may represent a distinct clonal
neoplasm.17 Thus, the diagnosis of LCH should include CD1a and
CD207 immunostaining.18,19 In Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD),
S1001 histiocytes are often multinucleated with obvious emperipolesis
(erythrocytes, plasma cells, and lymphocytes being engulfed by
histiocytes) (Figure 1), and do not express CD1a or CD207. Mitotic
activity may rarely be high in LCH, but the diagnosis of malignant
histiocytosis should not be established in the absence of major nuclear
atypia and clinical evidence of rapid tumor progression (grade D2).
LCH has also been reported in association with other hematologic
diseases including RDD,20 Hodgkin disease,21 and acute leukemia.22
Extent of disease should be assessed in all patients according to
a standardized workup.15 Following the HS guidelines, 4 different
groups are defined, depending on the number of organs (or systems)
involved, lung involvement, and the involvement of 1 of the 3
following risk organs (ROs): liver, spleen, and bone marrow (ie,
dysfunction of the hematopoietic system). In addition, disease
activity score23 is a way to monitor the disease and predict outcome.
Sequelae can be evaluated according to published scale.24,25
Erdheim-Chester disease
The mean age at diagnosis of ECD is 55 to 60 years of age, but rare
pediatric cases have been reported.26 Male to female ratio is 3:1.
Diagnosis of ECD is made with histology and phenotype of histiocytes
in appropriate clinical and radiological context27 (grade C2).
Skeletal involvement occurs in .95% of ECD patients. Bilateral,
symmetric cortical osteosclerosis of the diaphyseal and metaphyseal
regions is highly suggestive of ECD,28 and positron emission
tomography (PET) with 18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (PET–
computed tomography [CT]) has a high specificity29 (grade C2)
(Figure 2). Cardiovascular involvement is frequently underdiagnosed,
and occurs in at least 50% of patients.30 One-third of patients will
develop retroperitoneal fibrosis, especially around the kidneys and

 ureters. CNS involvement,31 diabetes insipidus, and/or exophthalmos
occur in 20% to 30% of patients. Xanthelasma, generally involving
the eyelids or periorbital spaces, is the most frequent cutaneous
manifestation.
Biopsy is mandatory for the diagnosis of ECD (grade C2), but
histology is not specific for the disease. Histopathology is characterized
by infiltration of tissues by foamy mononucleated histiocytes with
smallnucleus. Afew multinucleated histiocytes or Touton cells are also
frequently observed. Fibrosis is present in most cases and sometimes
abundant. Reactive lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils are also
frequent. ECD histiocytes are positive for CD68 and CD163 and
negative for CD1a. Some histiocytes may be positive for S100 protein.
Some biopsies may lack lipid-laden histiocytes, but the presence of
fibrosis and few “peculiar” histiocytes will favor the diagnosis.
ECD can be distinguished from LCH on the basis of the immune-
histopathological characteristics of the histiocytes, which are CD1a
negative in ECD. However, 20% of patients with ECD also have LCH
lesions, sometimes within the same biopsy.4 A few S1001 cells with
emperipolesismaybepresentinECD,thereforeexclusionofRDDmay
be difficult.
An important issue concerns extracutaneous or disseminated JXG.
Indeed, histopathology and phenotype are not different from ECD, and
some ECD patients may not have typical bilateral and symmetric
involvement of long bones. Thus, we recommend performing
molecular analysis of these cases, and to consider as ECD all
extracutaneous or disseminated JXG with gain-of-function mutation
of BRAF, NRAS, KRAS, or MAP2K1 (grade D2). A few cases of
histiocytosis for which differential diagnosis of anaplastic lymphoma
was excluded have strong expression of ALK,32 some of which have
translocation involving ALK.8,32 Some of these cases had histology and
clinical characteristics of ECD. Thus, we recommend performing ALK
immunohistochemistry screening for all clinically progressive histio-
cytoses lacking BRAF and MAP2K1 mutations (grade D2).
ECDismarkedbyaheterogenousclinicalcoursewithsomepatients
having few symptoms, and others having progressive and lethal
disease. PET scans are useful for assessment of ECD activity.29 CNS
involvement is associated with poor prognosis (grade C2).31
Somatic mutations or translocations and cell pathways of
“L”-type histiocytoses
The detection of recurrent BRAF p.V600E mutations in LCH5,6,33-35
represents a critical recent breakthrough in understanding LCH
pathogenesis. These mutations result in constitutive activation of the
MAPK pathway, are known to be oncogenic in several human
cancers,36 and are present in approximately half of LCH samples.
Moreover, detection of BRAF mutations in CD341 bone marrow cells
of some patients with high-risk LCH provided evidence that LCH may
be derived from hematopoietic progenitor cells.34 Mutations in
MAP2K1 (or MEK1), the kinase just downstream of BRAF, were
also identified in 19% of cases37-39 and occur in a mutually exclusive
manner with BRAF mutations (Figure 1). Rare mutations in other
MAPK pathway members including ARAF and MAP3K1 have also
beenreported.39,40Finally,mutationsaffectingothersignalingpathway
such as PIK3CA, PICK1, and PICK3R2 have also been described in
LCH.37,41
The presence of BRAF mutations has been investigated in non-
LCHs. Approximately 50% of ECD patients have BRAF p.V600E
mutations.6 Detection of BRAF mutants in ECD and LCH requires
methods of higher sensitivity than for other neoplasia due to allele
fraction ,10% in some cases (grade C2).7,34 Mutations in MAP2K1,
NRAS, KRAS, and ARAF have also been detected in ECD samples.7,8,42
In a recent pangenomic analysis, all cases of ECD had at least 1
mutation activating the MAPK pathway.8 In addition, in-frame fusions
involving several kinases including BRAF, ALK, and NTRK1 were
identified in ECD patients without BRAF, MAP2K1, or N/KRAS point
mutations.8 Similarly, a few cases of histiocytosis harbor ALK
translocations.32 These data highlight the possibility that structural
alterations involving kinases known to activate the MAPK pathway
may be recurrent in L-type histiocytic neoplasms. As in LCH, MAPK
mutations have been detected inblood monocytes.7PIK3CAmutations
werealso detected inECD7andwere notexclusive of BRAFmutations.
BRAF mutations were absent or only rarely detected in other
histiocytoses.6,16,43-45
In our experience, the presence of BRAF mutation is useful to
confirm difficult diagnoses of LCH or ECD. BRAFV600E mutations
have been detected in cell-free DNA extracted from plasma in patients
with disseminated LCH46 or ECD.47 Moreover, treatment with BRAF
inhibitors was shown to have major antitumor effects in patients with
ECD48-50 or LCH.50,51 Therefore, we recommend looking for
BRAFV600E and MAP2K1 mutations in all samples with difficult
diagnosis and allpatientswithfailure offirst-line treatment (grade C2).
The “C” group: cutaneous and
mucocutaneous histiocytoses
Non-LCH localized to skin and/or mucosa surfaces include a wide
variety of entities. Some of them may be associated with systemic
involvement.52,53 In 2005, Weitzman and Jaffe proposed a practical
classification based on immunophenotypic and clinical features.54 We
adopted herein roughly this classification with some modifications
(Table 2), although some patients display overlapping features.55,56

 JXGarediscussedinLgroup.Adultxanthogranuloma(AXG)isusually
solitary and persistent. Solitary reticulohistiocytoma (SRH) is simply a
xanthogranuloma in which oncocytic macrophages and ground-glass
giant cells dominate. Histologically, JXG/AXG/SRH appear as well-
circumscribed dermal or dermohypodermal nodules sparing the
epidermis. Mature lesions contain foamy cells, foreign-body giant cells,
and Touton cells aswellas macrophages,lymphocytes,and eosinophils.
Older, regressing lesions show proliferation of fibroblasts and fibrosis
that replace part of the infiltrate.57 Immunohistochemistry may be
helpful in some cases.19 The clinical differential diagnosis, especially of
the early lesions, includes Spitz nevi, mastocytomas, and dermatofi-
bromas. Spindle cell xanthogranulomas are more likely to be mis-
diagnosed, usually as dermatofibromas or blue nevi.
Benign cephalic histiocytosis (BCH) is a self-healing eruption
occurring during the first 3 years of life, usually limited to the head and
neck. The lesions consist of red to yellow papules. BCH overlaps with
generalized eruptive histiocytosis, progressive nodular histiocytosis,
papular xanthomas, and multiple JXG.52
Generalized eruptive histiocytosis (GEH) is characterized by the
presence of innumerable flesh-colored to red macules and papules that
develop in crops, mainly occurring in adults. For some authors, GEH
may represent the initial stage of a variety of macrophages disorders
such as JXG, xanthoma disseminatum (XD), and progressive nodular
histiocytosis (PNH).58 GEH must be distinguished from the eruptive
histiocytomas associated with hyperlipidemia. Careful search for
microorganisms should exclude eruptive cases of leishmaniasis,
leprosy, or atypical mycobacterial infections.
PNH is a rare, clinically distinct disorder affecting elderly patients.
Patients typically have hundreds of lesions of 2 distinct types: super-
ficial xanthomatous papules to nodules of 2 to 10 mm in diameter
and deep larger fibrous nodules. Conjunctival, oral, or laryngeal lesions
may occur. Lesions regress rarely after many years.
XD affects young men. It characteristically has a prominent
mucosal and visceral component. The eruption is composed of
numerous widely disseminated, brown papules and nodules, mainly
located on the flexor areas and around the eyes. Mucosa sites are
affected in half of the cases. The course of the disease is chronic and
persistent. Diabetes insipidus is encountered in about 40% of cases.
The non-JXG family
Skin localizations of RDD are usually unique, but may rarely be
disseminated or reveal a systemic RDD. Histology is described with
other RDD localizations.
Necrobiotic xanthogranuloma (NXG) is a rare disorder usually
associated with paraproteinemia characterized by large, often yellow,
indurated plaques, accompanied by atrophy, telangiectasia, and
occasionally ulceration. The most common locations are periorbital
and thoracic. Systemic involvement includes a cardiomyopathy and
hematological malignancies. Most patients have a monoclonal
gammopathy sometimes related to a multiple myeloma. The periorbital
location and clinicopathologic correlation are helpful to distinguish
NXG from necrobiosis lipoidica.
Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis (MRH) usually affects 50- to
60-year-old women, with widespread cutaneous involvement and
destructive arthritis. Lesions are papules, nodules, or tumors and
predominate on the extremities. “Coral bead” periungual papules are a
pathognomonic sign of MRH. In about half of the patients, nodules are
present also on the oral or nasal mucosa. Polyarthritis is almost always
present and may destroy hand joints. MRH may be associated with a
variety of malignancies or autoimmune diseases. The disease tends to
wax and wane over years. The characteristic histologic feature is the
presence of numerous multinucleate giant cells and oncocytic
macrophages showing eosinophilic, finely granular cytoplasm. The
most challenging diagnosis is fibroblastic rheumatism, which is
considered by some authors as a variety of histiocytosis but by others
as a fibromatosis.59
The “M” groups: malignant histiocytoses
This group includes diseases previously reported as MH, and more
recentlydiagnosedashistiocytic,IDC,LC,orindeterminatecellsarcomas.
Follicular DC sarcomas are excluded from the present review.
Primary malignant histiocytoses
MH are tumors with anaplastic histology.60 Diagnosis is mainly based
on phenotypic analysis with exclusion of other tumors by negativity for
keratins, EMA, Melan-A, HMB45, B and T lymphocyte markers,
follicular DC markers, and expression of at least 2 of the following
histiocyte/DC markers: CD68, CD163, CD4, and lysozyme. Differen-
tial diagnosis between MH relies on staining with a few antibodies,
namely S100 protein, CD1a, and CD207. Some cases were shown to
have different phenotype in different biopsies,61 and some cases with
atypical phenotype cannot be classified. Provided that the differential
diagnosis of lymphoma has been excluded, we recommend reusing
the old-term “malignant histiocytosis” (grade D1), and refer to the
phenotype as a subtype (Table 3).
An important diagnostic problem is the absence of precise
diagnostic histologic criteria for malignancy. Both prominent mitotic
activity with atypical mitoses and cellular atypia are mandatory, but
MH diagnosis should only be confirmed in patients with rapidly
progressing tumors (grade D2). Indeed, we have encountered a few
patients with typical histology but nonprogressing or spontaneously
regressive tumors. Contrasting with LCH, which generally has a
normal karyotype and ,5 somatic mutations,37 MH usually has
frequent chromosomal gains or losses.62
Secondary malignant histiocytoses
Theseconditions occur after or sometimes simultaneously with another
hematologic neoplasm. Malignant cells have anaplastic morphology
and express markers of macrophages and/or DCs. MH have to be
distinguished from myeloid sarcomas, the latter being tissue infiltration
by leukemic cells with no or minor cytologic differences with blood or
bone marrow cells.

 Cases of MH are associated with lymphoproliferations such as
follicular lymphomas,63 hairy cell leukemia,44 chronic lymphoblastic
leukemia,64,65 acute lymphoblastic leukemia.66 Some were also
reported after chronic myelomonocytic leukemia67 and LCH.68
Clonal relationship with primary hemopathy has been established
by showing a common immunoglobulin rearangement,63,64 t(14;18)
translocation,63 BRAF mutation,44 or chromosomal alteration65 in
primary proliferation and MH. Thus, secondary MH could result either
from anaplastic progression with aberrant expression of some
histiocyte/DC markers, or from a trans-differentiation of a
hemoproliferation.
The “R” group: Rosai-Dorfman disease and miscellaneous
noncutaneous, non-Langerhans cell histiocytoses
Classical sporadic RDD (Table 4) involves lymph nodes.69,70 It is more
common in children and young adults, and more frequent in males of
African descent. The most common presentation is bilateral painless
massive cervical lymphadenopathy associated with fever, night sweats,
fatigue, and weight loss.69,70 Mediastinal, inguinal, and retroperitoneal
nodes may also be involved.
The diagnosis requires the presence of large histiocytic cells
displaying hypochromatic nuclei and pale cytoplasm, often with
abundantemperipolesiswithS1001,fascin1,CD6811,CD141,HLA-
DR1, CD1631 macrophages without CD1a or CD207 staining.
Involved tissues usually contain abundant polyclonal plasma cells. In
lymph nodes, the large S1001 histiocytes are mainly localized within
the sinuses, and the cortex usually contains numerous plasma cells and
activated B cells. Laboratory abnormalities are nonspecific with
elevated erythrocytesedimentation rateand leukocytosis,high ferritin,
hypergammaglobulinemia, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia.71
Extranodal involvement by sporadic RDD has been documented in
43% of cases with the mostfrequentsites being skin,nasal cavity,bone,
soft tissue, and retro-orbital tissue.71 Bone RDD may be responsible for
isolated lytic lesions, or associated with other localizations.72
Intracranial RDD usually occurs without extracranial localization, and
most lesions are attached to the dura.73 CNS disease can pre-
sent clinically and radiologically as meningioma, but the spinal fluid is
usually suggestive of RDD.71 Some patients may have pachymenin-
gitis and differential diagnosis with IgG4 disease may be difficult.74
RDD has to be distinguished from LCH; however, negativity for
CD1a, as well as the presence of large CD1a-negative histiocytes with
emperipolesis are in favor of RDD. Other histiocytoses, including LC
sarcomas and histiocytic sarcomas, may harbor some RDD-like cells
with emperipolesis, but usually are not predominant. In skin lesions,
histopathological differential diagnosis with JXG may be difficult as
RDD histiocytes may have a foamy aspect and be multinucleate, and
emperipolesis, which is a useful criterion is not specific for diagnosing
RDD.75
Finally, RDD frequently contains abundant IgG4-positive plasma
cells,76 and differential diagnosis with hyperIgG4 syndrome may be
difficult. Therefore, we recommend evaluating IgG41 plasma cell
infiltration in all RDD (grade D2). A RDD pattern has been associated
with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, systemic lupus erythematosus,
and juvenile idiopathic arthritis.77 Sporadic RDD is often self-limited
withagoodoutcome,especiallyinclassicalform.However,5%to11%
of patients may die of their disease.
Inherited conditions predisposing to RDD or RDD-like lesions
H syndrome is an autosomal genetic condition characterized by
hyperpigmentation, hypertrichosis, hepatosplenomegaly, hearing
loss, heart anomalies, hypogonadism, low height (short stature),
hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus, and hallux valgus/flexion contrac-
tures. It is related to mutation within the SLC29A3 gene. Lymph
nodes with RDD are present in 20% of patients.78 RDD lesions can
also be detected in skin or nasal localizations.79
A histopathological pattern of RDD was reported in the lymph
nodes of 41% of patients with autoimmune lymphoproliferative
syndrome (ALPS) type Ia, with TNFRSF6 heterozygous germ line
mutations affecting the gene encoding Fas.80 These patients tend to be
more often males, present at an earlier age, and have more severe
manifestations of ALPS. However, the RDD changes tend to be mainly
nodal and self-limited in these cases, and only in a small number of
patients contribute significantly to the clinical manifestations of ALPS.
Miscellaneous noncutaneous, non-Langerhans
cell histiocytoses
Histological diagnosis and classification of histiocytoses may be
difficult, and definitive diagnosis requires close collaboration between
pathologist, clinicians, and radiologist. Despite review by panels of
experts, some cases still could not be classified as a defined entity, and
thus may require the term of “histiocytosis not otherwise specified”.
The “H” group: hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis and macrophage
activation syndrome
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare, often-fatal
syndrome of intense immune activation characterized by fever,
cytopenias, hepatosplenomegaly, and hyperferritinemia.81 Although
HLH has various underlying causes, all subtypes of HLH are related
to immune dysregulation that leads to hypercytokinemia and an

 accumulation of activated macrophages in organs and tissues.82 HLH is
divided into primary (with known Mendelian inheritance) and
secondary or reactive HLH. In cases where a molecular diagnosis is
lacking, patients can be clinically diagnosed with HLH upon fulfillment
ofatleast5of8diagnosticcriteria.83First-linetreatmentofbothprimary
and secondary HLH is directed to control the hyperinflammation. For
primary HLH, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only
available cure.84,85
Primary HLH is associated with several Mendelian inherited im-
mune disorders, most of which induce impairment86 (Table 5; sup-
plementalTable1) or disturbance of theinflammasome.87,88However,
a proportion of suspected primary cases await molecular definition.89
The clinicalsymptomsusually become evident during the firstyears of
life, although onset into adulthood has been reported.90 Patients may
suffer from 1orseveralacuteepisodes thatmay be rapidlyprogressive.
Each acute episode may be triggered by infection (see Table 5) or
vaccination. In young children, HLH-like manifestations may also
occur inassociation with primary immunodeficiencies,especially with
primary T-cell deficiencies such as MAGT1, ITK, CD27, CTPS1,
MST1, Dock 8, Dock 2, ORAI1, STIM1, or Coroinin1A deficiencies.
These HLH-like syndromes are not to be considered as true primary
HLH, they are frequently triggered by Epstein-Barr virus infection
causing B lymphoproliferation.91
Secondary HLH may occur at any age, and the first clinical
symptomsare usually associated withaninfectious episode, rheumatic
condition, or malignancy.92 The clinical course may be severe, and the
mortality is still significant.93 Recently, some cases of “secondary”
HLH have been linked to mutations that confer a partial impairment of
cytolytic function.92 These findings make the distinction between
primary and secondary HLH increasingly difficult. Symptoms of HLH
developing in a patient with an underlying rheumatic condition are
historically called Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS). Sugges-
tions to replace the term MAS with “secondary HLH” first appeared in
theliteraturein2002.94,95WesuggestusingthetermMAS-HLHforthis
subset of HLH.
Conclusion
Herein, we have provided an overview of histiocytoses with a revised
proposed grouping of .100 subtypes of these rare entities in 5 groups
based on clinical and/or molecular relevance. Most cases of L group
diseases have clonal mutations activating MAPK pathways5-8,33-35,37
and are considered by some as inflammatory myeloid neoplasms.34
Major clinical responses have been obtained with MAPK inhibitors for
patients of this group.48-51 Several patientshave histiocytoses limited to
skin, the hallmark of which is solitary cutaneous JXG. Pathogenesis of
most cutaneous histiocytoses is still unknown. MH may be primitive
cancers or secondary to other hematologic neoplasia, and may be
subclassified based on primitive localization, and/or the expression of
macrophage and DC markers. RDD has characteristic histologic
features, but corresponds to several different inherited or sporadic
conditions,oftenassociated withIgG41plasma cellinfiltration. Finally,
histiocyte infiltration that is frequently but not always observed in HLH
has been shown to be reactive to an abnormal immune activation.
