Abstract
Rationale Alcohol and cannabis use have been implicated in
aggression. Alcohol consumption is known to facilitate ag-
gression, whereas a causal link between cannabis and aggres-
sion has not been clearly demonstrated.
Objectives This study investigated the acute effects of alcohol
and cannabis on subjective aggression in alcohol and cannabis
users, respectively, following aggression exposure. Drug-free
controls served as a reference. It was hypothesized that ag-
gression exposure would increase subjective aggression in
alcohol users during alcohol intoxication, whereas it was ex-
pected to decrease subjective aggression in cannabis users
during cannabis intoxication.
Methods Heavy alcohol (n = 20) and regular cannabis users
(n = 21), and controls (n = 20) were included in a mixed
factorial study. Alcohol and cannabis users received single
doses of alcohol and placebo or cannabis and placebo, respec-
tively. Subjective aggression was assessed before and after
aggression exposure consisting of administrations of the
point-subtraction aggression paradigm (PSAP) and the single
category implicit association test (SC-IAT). Testosterone and
cortisol levels in response to alcohol/cannabis treatment and
aggression exposure were recorded as secondary outcome
measures.
Results Subjective aggression significantly increased follow-
ing aggression exposure in all groups while being sober.
Alcohol intoxication increased subjective aggression whereas
cannabis decreased the subjective aggression following ag-
gression exposure. Aggressive responses during the PSAP
increased following alcohol and decreased following cannabis
relative to placebo. Changes in aggressive feeling or response
were not correlated to the neuroendocrine response to
treatments.
Conclusions It is concluded that alcohol facilitates feelings of
aggression whereas cannabis diminishes aggressive feelings
in heavy alcohol and regular cannabis users, respectively.

Introduction
Alcohol and cannabis are among the most frequently used
drugs worldwide (EMCDDA 2012). The elicitation of aggres-
sive behavior following alcohol consumption, also called
Bintoxicated aggression,^ has been frequently reported on a
global scale (Murdoch et al. 1990). Cannabis intoxication,
however, does not typically lead to aggression in most indi-
viduals (Hoaken and Stewart 2003), but it might increase or
facilitate aggression in certain subgroups (i.e., violent of-
fenders, clinical population) (Cherek et al. 1993). However,
not everybody who uses alcohol or cannabis engages in ag-
gressive behaviors (Heinz et al. 2001; Kopak et al. 2014;
Lammers et al. 2014). A clear relationship between alcohol,
drugs, and intoxicated aggression is neither linear nor invari-
ant. Some drugs can facilitate aggressive behavior through

 their direct pharmacological effects during intoxication,
through neurotoxic effects caused by chronic drug use over
time or through withdrawal effects during abstinence (Hoaken
and Stewart 2003).
The relation between alcohol consumption and aggression
has been well established. Experimental studies on aggression
have demonstrated that acute doses of alcohol facilitate ag-
gressive behavior in a dose-related manner as assessed by
vocal recordings and questionnaires (Bushman and Cooper
1990; Ito et al. 1996). Studies using laboratory-based mea-
sures of aggression have generally found that aggression
was higher in participants who were intoxicated compared to
those who received no alcohol (for a review see Giancola and
Chermack, 1998). Longitudinal and observational studies sug-
gest that acute episodes of heavy alcohol consumption are
more strongly related to aggressive behavior than chronic al-
cohol consumption (Chermack and Blow 2002; Fals-Stewart
2003). This indicates that alcohol-induced aggression is more
likely to occur in users who are consuming excessively within
a given drinking episode (Heinz et al. 2011), although it is
only a minority of people who become aggressive when under
the influence of alcohol (Beck and Heinz 2013).
The relation between cannabis use and aggression has also
been investigated in studies with animals and with humans. In
animals, studies have shown a decrease in aggressive behavior
of rodents and primates following cannabis administration
(Miczek and Barry 1977; Miczek 1978). In humans, experi-
mental findings on acute effects of cannabis on aggression are
mixed (Taylor et al. 1976; Moore and Stuart 2005). Some
studies indicate that cannabis intoxication is associated with
the elicitation of aggression (Cherek et al. 1993; Howard and
Menkes 2007). However, interpretation of these findings is
difficult as they are based on relatively small sample sizes
(Cherek et al. 1993; Howard and Menkes 2007) or only in-
cluded male participants with self-reported anti-social tenden-
cies (Cherek et al. 1993). Moreover, dose and route of admin-
istration differed considerably between studies. Cannabis ef-
fects on aggression are exerted in a dose-dependent manner.
Low doses (0.1 mg/kg) of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) slight-
ly increased the willingness of participants to increase shock
intensity given to opponents, were moderate to high doses
(0.25–0.4 mg/kg) decreased aggressive response during a
laboratory-based aggression study (Myerscough and Taylor
1985). In the latter study, however, participants were random-
ly assigned to one of the three dose conditions without a pla-
cebo condition or control group, making it difficult to assess
whether the effect was pharmacological, contextual, or due to
individual differences. One study monitored aggression in
long-term heavy cannabis users (Kouri et al. 1999) and report-
ed increased aggressive responses relative to controls when
tested 3 and 7 days into abstinence.
Aggressive behavior is modulated by neuroendocrine
mechanisms, and it is suggested that changes in cortisol and
testosterone are predictive of changes in aggression (Brown
and Dobs 2002; Brown et al. 2008; Terburg et al. 2009).
Fluctuations in cortisol levels can affect the relationship be-
tween testosterone and the expression of aggression (Popma
et al. 2007). It is unclear whether hormones could play a me-
diating role in the relationship between drugs and aggression.
Previous studies report significant changes in testosterone and
cortisol levels following acute alcohol and cannabis adminis-
tration (Ylikahri et al. 1974; Mendelson et al. 1977; Välimäki
et al. 1990; Lovallo et al. 2000; Sarkola et al. 2001; Brown and
Dobs 2002; Frias et al. 2002; Thayer et al. 2006). Suppression
of male testosterone levels has been reported after short-term
heavy drinking (Sarkola and Eriksson 2003), and a reduction
in cortisol reactivity was found in heavy drinkers compared to
light drinkers after a high (0.8 g/kg) alcohol dose (King et al.
2006). Studies on the effects of cannabis show decreased male
testosterone levels after both acute and chronic cannabis use
(Kolodny et al. 1974, 1976) and elevated cortisol levels in
occasional smokers (Cone et al. 1986); these findings were
not corroborated by subsequent studies however (Mendelson
et al. 1974; Schaefer et al. 1975; Block et al. 1991).
While aggression is defined objectively as any type of be-
havior aimed at harming another living being who is motivat-
ed to avoid such a behavioral act (Baron 1977), aggression in
humans could also be operationalized on a subjective level as
the increase in aggressive inclination that is triggered by an
aversive/aggressive stimulus or event underlying an
emotional-cognitive state. The present study investigated the
acute effects of alcohol and cannabis on subjective aggression
following aggression exposure in heavy alcohol and regular
cannabis users, respectively. Subjective aggression was direct-
ly measured by means of a visual analogue scale (VAS) that
allowed participants to rate their feeling of aggression on a
linear scale ranging from Bnot aggressive at all^ to Bvery
aggressive.^ Previous studies (Bond and Lader 1974; Cleare
and Bond 1995) that have used rating scales of subjective
aggression in human drug studies demonstrated that subjec-
tive feelings of aggression and hostility are positively corre-
lated to behavioral acts or measures of aggression. The rele-
vance of subjective aggression therefore lies in the notion that
it may predict or coincide with behavioral acts of aggression.
Aggression exposure consisted of two tasks developed to
evoke and measure aggressive responses: i.e. the single cate-
gory implicit association test (SC-IAT) and the point-
subtraction aggression paradigm (PSAP). Subjective aggres-
sion occurring in response to some perceived provocation can
be categorized as subjective affective/reactive aggression
(Anderson and Bushman 2002). A control group served as
between group reference in order to compare aggressive re-
sponses of alcohol and cannabis users with non-drug users.
Subjective aggression in alcohol and cannabis users was com-
pared with controls while sober and compared to placebo
while intoxicated. It was expected that aggression exposure
3332
Psychopharmacology (2016) 233:3331–3340
 would increase subjective aggression in alcohol users during
alcohol intoxication and decrease subjective aggression in
cannabis users during cannabis intoxication. It was further
expected that subjective aggression would increase after ag-
gression exposure in all groups when sober. Neuroendocrine
measures of cortisol and testosterone in response to alcohol/
cannabis treatment and after aggression exposure were record-
ed as additional, secondary outcome measures.
Experimental procedures
Participants
The present study included a group of heavy alcohol and
regular cannabis users, and a control group. Heavy alcohol
use was defined as using on average 21 to 50 alcoholic drinks
a week for males or 15 to 35 alcoholic drinks a week for
females during the last year (Cassisi et al. 1998). Regular
cannabis use was defined as having used cannabis at least 3
times a week but no more than 10 times a week, during the
previous year (Ramaekers et al. 2009).
Experimental use of cannabis in the alcohol group was
allowed only if it occurred more than a year ago. Alcohol
use between 1 and 14 units/week (for both males and females)
was allowed in the cannabis group. Controls were defined as
not currently using cannabis or other drugs; experimental use
of cannabis was allowed if it occurred more than a year ago
and incidental alcohol use was permitted (1–7 units/week for
women and 1–14 units of alcohol/week for men). Inclusion
criteria were as follows: (i) age 18–40 years, (ii) free from
psychotropic medication, (iii) good physical health, and (iv)
body mass index within 18.5–28 kg/m2. Exclusion criteria
included: (i) history of drug abuse as assessed by drug urine
screens and questionnaires, (ii) presence or history of psychi-
atric or neurological disorder as assessed by a medical ques-
tionnaire, (iii) pregnancy, (iv) cardiovascular abnormalities as
assessed by 12-lead ECG, (v) excessive smoking (>15 ciga-
rettes per day) and (vi) hypertension.
Five participants from the alcohol group and 2 participants
from the cannabis group dropped out due to personal circum-
stances. The dropouts were replaced, and the final dataset
consisted of 61 participants, i.e. 20 participants in the alcohol
and control group and 21 participants in the cannabis group.
Participants (35 male, 26 female) were aged between 18 and
28 (mean (SD) 22.5 (2.3) years) (Table 1). Participants’ age in
the alcohol and cannabis group were matched with controls.
The participants underwent a general medical examination
including routine laboratory tests, provided a written informed
consent, and filled out a questionnaire on history of drug use.
This study was part of a larger experiment and was conducted
according to the code of ethics on human experimentation
established by the declaration of Helsinki (1964) and amended
in Fortaleza (2013) and approved by the Medical Ethics
Committee of the Academic Hospital of Maastricht and
Maastricht University (Dutch Trial Register: trial number:
NTR3428). A permit from the Dutch drug enforcement ad-
ministration was acquired for obtaining, storing, and adminis-
tering cannabis. Participants received monetary compensation
for their participation in the study.
Design and treatments
Participants in the alcohol and cannabis group participated in a
double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject study involv-
ing two experimental conditions consisting of placebo and
alcohol or cannabis treatment for the alcohol and cannabis
group, respectively. An age matched control group of non-
drug users was included that received no treatment.
Alcohol (ethyl alcohol 96 %) was mixed with orange juice
to a total volume of 500 mL, divided into two beverages
(250 mL each). Alcohol doses were individually calibrated
using the formula of Watson et al. (1981) to achieve a total
blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.8 g/L, and was kept
constant at 0.8 g/L by means of booster doses with an interval
of approximately 1 h. The alcohol placebo consisted of
500 mL orange juice, divided into two beverages, which
contained a small amount of alcohol (3 mL) to provide an
alcohol scent when consuming the beverage. Participants’
BAC was measured at baseline (T0), before aggression expo-
sure (T1), and after aggression exposure (T2) by means of a
breathalyzer (Fig. 1).
The cannabis group received in total 300 μg THC/kg
bodyweight, divided over two successive doses of 200 and
100 μg THC/kg bodyweight with an interval of approximately
1 h. THC or placebo was administered using a Volcano vaporizer
produced by Storz-Bickel, Germany (http://www.storz-bickel.
com). Hot air would pass through the filling chamber holding
the cannabis (containing 12 % THC), which caused the THC or
placebo to vaporize and blend with the air. The THC molecules
or the placebo (vapor) was trapped in a valve balloon. The valve
of the balloon was put against participants’ lips, and they were
instructed to inhale deeply for about 10 s and then exhale. The
volume of the balloon was inhaled in 7 to 10 subsequent breaths,
and the balloon had to be emptied within 10 min.
Procedures
Participants were asked to refrain from drug use at least 1 week
prior to the start and during the study. Participants were not
allowed to use alcohol, tobacco, or caffeinated beverages on
the day before an experimental session and were requested to
arrive at experimental sessions well-rested. Drug and alcohol
screens were carried out upon arrival at our testing facilities.
Urine drug screens assessed for the presence of benzodiaze-
pines, opiates, cocaine, marijuana, MDMA, and

 (meth)amphetamine. Women were also tested for pregnancy.
Study treatments were only administered after negative preg-
nancy tests and negative drug screens, except for marijuana in
the cannabis group. For a detailed schematic representation of
a test day, see Fig. 1.
The experimental session included an aggression exposure
block, which consisted of the administration of the SC-IAT
and the PSAP. Subjective aggression was measured before
and after aggression exposure. Alcohol (or alcohol placebo)
or cannabis (or cannabis placebo) administration was com-
pleted at 30 and 15 min prior to aggression exposure, with
placebo conditions serving as reference. Conditions were sep-
arated by a minimum washout period of 7 days to avoid carry-
over effects. The control group received no treatment but the
test day was similar on all other aspects. All participants re-
ceived a training session before onset of the experimental
sessions in order to familiarize them with tests, procedures,
and in using the vaporizer.

 at the other end of the line. Participants had to rate how ag-
gressive they felt at two different time points (i.e., before and
after the aggression exposure block). The first time point was
aimed to assess the acute effects of alcohol and cannabis treat-
ment on subjective aggression in the alcohol and cannabis
group, respectively. The second assessment point followed
after a period of aggression manipulation, in which partici-
pants were exposed to aggressive stimuli during two labora-
tory tasks (SC-IAT and PSAP) in order to provoke aggression
in the participants. The second time point was aimed to assess
both the effects of alcohol and cannabis treatment and the
effects of the provocation on subjective aggression.
Aggression exposure
The single category implicit association test
The SC-IAT measures the strength of individuals’ affective
evaluative associations (positive vs. negative) with a single
attitude object (Greenwald et al. 2003; Karpinski and
Steinman 2006). In this task, positive and negative words
were coupled with an aggression stimulus. Aggression stimuli
were static pictures displaying aggressive acts carried out by
other individuals, e.g., violent protests, restrainment with a
weapon. Acts of aggression where both physical (i.e.,
punching, kicking) and verbal (i.e. provocation in traffic-
related aggression). The task was divided into a practice block
and 2 test blocks (Supplementary Table 1). During the practice
block (target discrimination), only the target concepts were
presented and participants had to respond using the corre-
sponding keys (i.e. press right button for positive words and
the left button for negative words or vice versa). In the first
block (compatible block), positive words and aggression stim-
uli were categorized on the right key and negative words were
categorized on the left key. In the second block (incompatible
block), negative words and aggression stimuli were catego-
rized on the left key and positive words were categorized on
the right key. A correct response was defined when a partici-
pant would react to a positive/negative word or an aggression
stimulus by pressing the corresponding key. The two blocks
were counterbalanced across treatments conditions.
The rationale behind this task is that when participants have
a positive association with aggressive behavior rather than a
negative association, they are quicker to respond when aggres-
sion stimuli are paired up with positive words compared to
blocks where aggression stimuli and negative words are
paired up. The dependent variable was the D-score, which
was calculated by subtracting the mean reaction time (RT) of
correct responses in the compatible block from the mean RTof
correct responses in the incompatible block, divided by the
standard deviation (SD) of all correct responses within the
compatible and incompatible block.
The point-subtraction aggression paradigm
The PSAP is a free-operant measure of human aggression
(Cherek 1981). It is a computer-based task where participants
are paired up with a fictitious (unbeknownst to the participant)
counterpart and could earn money by pressing buttons. A
counter indicating the net value of money earned was shown
on the screen. Three response buttons (labeled A, B, or C)
were presented to the participants on a row across a response
panel: a monetary-reinforced option (A), an aggressive option
(B), and an escape option (C). By pressing button A 100
consecutive times, 15 cents was added to the participants’
counter. By pressing button B 10 times, 15 cents was
subtracted from the counterpart at no gain to the participant.
Button C, the escape option, had to be pressed 10 times and
temporarily protected the participants’ money from being
subtracted by the fictitious counterpart. Participants were pro-
voked at random intervals throughout the session by having
15 cents subtracted from their counter, which was ostensibly
ascribed to the counterpart.
Participants were told that their counterpart was sitting at a
different location in the same building. The participants were
instructed to earn as much money as possible and had 20 min
to complete the task. Participants could freely decide which
buttons to press throughout the task and were aware that press-
ing button C would protect their money for a period of time.
Aggression was not mentioned in the instructions. In reality, a
computer program controlled all points subtracted by the fic-
titious counterpart. The dependent variable was the number of
times the B button (aggressive responses) had been pressed.
Neuroendocrine measures
Testosterone and cortisol levels were collected as neuroendo-
crine measures in response to alcohol and cannabis treatment
for the alcohol and cannabis group, respectively, and in re-
sponse to aggression exposure for all 3 groups. Blood samples
(8 mL) to determine cortisol and testosterone concentrations
were collected from the participants before (T1) and after ag-
gression exposure (T2) (Fig. 1). The blood samples were cen-
trifuged immediately and sent away for analysis after each test
day. Concentrations were determined by means of the Cobas
assay (Roche Diagnostics Limited, West Sussex, UK). The
quantification limit for testosterone and cortisol were 0.087
and 0.500 nmol/L, respectively.
Pharmacokinetic measures
In the cannabis group, blood samples (8 mL) to determine
cannabinoid concentrations (THC and metabolites OH-THC
and THC-COOH) were collected at 3 successive times during
each test day, i.e. at baseline (T0) before aggression exposure
Psychopharmacology (2016) 233:3331–3340
3335
 (T1) and after aggression exposure (T2) (Fig. 1). These blood
samples were centrifuged immediately; serum was transferred
into a tube and was stored at −20 °C. Cannabinoid concentra-
tions were determined by the Institute of Forensic Toxicology,
University of Frankfurt, using solid phase extraction and gas
chromatography with mass spectrometric detection with a
limit of quantification of 1.0 ng/mL.
Statistics
Two generalized linear models (GLM) were used to analyze
differences in subjective aggression and neuroendocrine mea-
sures between the 3 groups during abstinence (GLM1) and to
test how these measures were affected by acute cannabis and/
or alcohol intoxication following aggression exposure com-
pared to placebo (GLM2). VAS data for subjective aggression
were log-transformed to obtain a normal distribution.
GLM1 included Group (3 levels; alcohol group when so-
ber, cannabis group when sober, and controls) as the between-
subject factor and Aggression exposure (two levels; before
and after aggression exposure) as the within-subject factor.
These were followed by simple group contrasts with the con-
trol group as reference.
GLM2 included Group (2 levels; alcohol and cannabis
users) as the between-subject factor and Treatment (2 levels;
placebo and alcohol/cannabis) and Aggression exposure (2
levels; before and after aggression exposure) as the within-
subjects factors.
The same approach in GLM 1 and 2 was followed for the
SC-IAT and PSAP with the exclusion of the factor aggression
exposure. In case the sphericity assumption was violated, the
Greenhouse-Geisser correction was used. The alpha criterion
significance level was set at p = 0.05.
Spearman correlations were used to investigate associa-
tions between neuroendocrine measures, subjective aggres-
sion, and performance in the PSAP and SC-IAT when sober
and when intoxicated. All statistical tests were conducted with
SPSS version 21.
Results
Missing data
A total of 20 complete datasets for the alcohol and control
group and 21 datasets for the cannabis group entered the anal-
yses for the SC-IAT. Due to technical failures, complete data
sets were missing for the PSAP (4 participants) and aggression
VAS (2 participants) PSAP data of one participant was exclud-
ed from analysis due to extreme values. Due to difficulties
during blood sample collection, testosterone and cortisol
samples from 14 participants could not be collected during
both experimental sessions (see Supplementary Table 2).
Measures of aggression
GLM 1: comparisons across groups while sober
GLM analyses revealed a main effect of Aggression exposure
on subjective aggression (F2,58 = 28.31; p = .000) when sober.
Subjective ratings across groups were higher after aggression
exposure compared to before (Fig. 2). There was no effect of
Group or interaction with Aggression exposure when sober.
There was no main difference in aggressive responses be-
tween groups during the PSAP when sober (Fig. 3). Escape
response rates did differ across the 3 groups during sobriety
(F2,53 = 4.17; p = .021). Simple contrast revealed a difference
in escape response rates between the control group and alcohol
group (p = .006), but not between the cannabis group and con-
trols (p = .189). Escape response rates in the alcohol group was
lower compared to controls. A summary of mean (SE) mone-
tary, aggressive, and escape rates is given in Supplementary
Table 3.
Mean D-scores (SE) during the SC-IAT were negative and
did not differ between groups when sober (i.e., alcohol (−0.124
(.07)), cannabis (−0.118(.04)), controls (−0.195(.07))).
GLM analyses revealed no main effects of Group or
Aggression exposure nor the interaction between Group and
Aggression exposure on testosterone levels (Fig. 2). Analyses
revealed a main effect of Aggression exposure on cortisol
levels (F2,46 = 6.62; p = .013) when sober. Cortisol levels
across groups were lower after aggression exposure compared
to before. Cortisol levels in the control group before and after
exposure actually did not differ significantly from each other
(difference score 1.53 nmol/L.) There was no main effect of
Group (F2,46 = 3.09; p = .055) or interaction with Aggression
exposure on cortisol levels when sober.
There were no significant correlations between neuroendo-
crine measures, subjective aggression, and performance dur-
ing the PSAP and SC-IAT in the 3 groups when sober.
GLM 2: comparisons between treatments and placebo
GLM analyses revealed a main effect of Aggression exposure
(F1,37 = 17.05; p = .000) and Group (F1,37 = 4.19; p = .048) on
subjective aggression. Subjective aggression was generally
higher after aggression exposure compared to before, but dif-
fered between the alcohol and cannabis group. Subjective ag-
gression in the alcohol group was overall higher compared to
the cannabis group. Analysis revealed a significant interaction
between Treatment and Group (F1,37 = 7.08; p = .011) on
subjective aggression. Subjective aggression in the alcohol
group was higher in the alcohol compared to placebo condi-
tion, whereas subjective aggression in the cannabis group was
3336
Psychopharmacology (2016) 233:3331–3340
 lower in the cannabis conditions compared to placebo (Fig. 2).
There was no effect of Treatment or interaction with
Aggression exposure.
There was no effect of Treatment or Group on D-scores
during the SC-IAT. Mean D-scores (SE) following alcohol
(−0.160 (.07)) and cannabis (−0.229 (.06)) treatment did not
differ from placebo conditions or between groups.
GLM analyses revealed no main effects, but a significant
interaction between Treatment and group (F1,34 = 6.16;
p = .018) on aggressive responses in the PSAP. Aggressive
responses in the alcohol group were higher in the alcohol
compared to placebo condition, whereas aggressive responses
in the cannabis group were lower in the cannabis conditions
compared to placebo (Fig. 3). Both monetary response and
escape rates (i.e. A responses and C responses) during alcohol
or cannabis intoxication did not differ from placebo conditions
or between these two groups.
GLM analyses revealed no main effects of Treatment,
Aggression exposure, or Group, but a significant 3-way inter-
action of Treatment*Aggression exposure*Group on testos-
terone (F1,30 = 4.92; p = .034) and cortisol levels
(F1,31 = 6.32; p = .017) (Fig. 2). The alcohol group did not

 show a change in testosterone levels after alcohol treatment

nabis group on the other hand showed a decrease in testoster-
one levels after cannabis treatment, particularly after aggres-
sion exposure. Participants in the alcohol group had a small
decrease in cortisol levels after alcohol treatment whereas par-
ticipants in the cannabis group showed an increase in cortisol
levels after cannabis treatment, particularly prior to aggres-
sion, compared to placebo.
During alcohol and cannabis intoxication, subjective rat-
ings following aggression exposure positively correlated with
respectively aggressive responses (rs(13) = .637; p = .011) and
escape responses (rs(18) = .491; p = .028) in the PSAP.
There were no significant correlations between neuroendo-
crine measures and performance during the PSAP and SC-IAT
in the alcohol and cannabis group during intoxication.

centrations in serum for the alcohol and cannabis treatment

Discussion
The aim of the present study was to assess the acute effects of
alcohol and cannabis on subjective aggression in heavy alco-
hol and regular cannabis users after aggression exposure.
Alcohol users received alcohol or placebo and cannabis users
were given cannabis or placebo. A group of non-drug users
served as controls. Neuroendocrine measure of testosterone
and cortisol were collected as additional outcome measures
in response to acute alcohol and cannabis intoxication and
after aggression exposure.
Subjective aggression after aggression exposure was in-
creased across all 3 groups but did not differ between groups
when sober, indicating that the aggression manipulation was
successful. Aggressive responses of sober alcohol and canna-
bis users after aggression exposure did not differ from controls
during the PSAP. All groups had equal negative D-scores in
the SC-IAT when sober, indicating that all 3 groups had a
negative implicit association with aggression. Testosterone
levels did not change after aggression exposure or differ be-
tween groups. Cortisol levels, on the other hand, decreased to
similar degrees in all groups after aggression exposure. Taken
together, we did not record any difference in subjective ag-
gression and aggressive responses between sober alcohol and
cannabis users and drug-free controls.
Subjective experience of aggression exposure was modi-
fied by treatments as compared to placebo, as indicated by
significant Group × Treatment interactions. Alcohol intoxica-
tion increased subjective aggression in the alcohol group. The
cannabis group in contrast experienced a reduction in subjec-
tive aggression during cannabis intoxication. Although alco-
hol intoxication increased subjective feelings of aggression in
heavy alcohol users, the general increment was relatively
mild. Yet, the direction of the change suggests that alcohol
users might feel more aggressive with higher alcohol doses.
Likewise, alcohol increased the number of aggressive re-
sponses in the PSAP in the alcohol group, whereas cannabis
reduced the number of aggressive responses in the cannabis
group. These interactions between Treatment and Group point
to opposing effects of alcohol and cannabis on aggression.
These findings are generally in line with previous studies that
showed alcohol-induced aggression at higher doses. A study
conducted among healthy male and female social drinkers
showed that moderate (0.4 g/kg) to high (0.8 g/kg) alcohol
doses do not increase aggression (Gowin et al. 2010), while
others showed a dose-related increase in aggression for both
genders at the 0.75 and 1.0 g/kg alcohol doses (Duke et al.
2011). The cannabis group received a moderate to high can-
nabis dose which diminished aggressive responses during in-
toxication, which is in line with previous findings
(Myerscough and Taylor 1985). Subjective measures of ag-
gressive feelings in the alcohol group were positively corre-
lated to performance in the PSAP during intoxication, i.e.
aggressive responses increased in the PSAP with increased
feelings of aggression, which was not observed in the canna-
bis group. This indicates that subjective feelings of aggression
in heavy alcohol users coincide with behavioral outcome mea-
sures of aggression.
Neuroendocrine responses to alcohol and cannabis were
very minimal. We observed no main effects of Treatment,
Group, and Aggression exposure, but their 3-way interactions
reached significance. These indicated that cannabis reduced
testosterone levels following aggression exposure whereas

 alcohol did not. In addition, there were indications that can-
nabis increased cortisol levels whereas alcohol decreased cor-
tisol, particularly prior to aggression exposure. Attenuated
cortisol response in regular alcohol users following a high
alcohol dose have been reported before (Cone et al. 1986;
King et al. 2006). During sobriety, cortisol levels in the alco-
hol and cannabis group were decreased after aggression expo-
sure, whereas no changes in testosterone levels were observed.
It has been suggested that the elicitation of aggression is relat-
ed to fluctuations in testosterone and cortisol or their ratio
(Popma et al. 2007). More specifically, heightened levels of
testosterone are not enough to elicit aggression as sensitivity
to punishment and fear are still inhibiting behavior in the
presence of high cortisol levels. When high testosterone is
combined with low cortisol levels, aggression is not inhibited
and could lead to the expression of aggressive behaviors
(Terburg et al. 2009). The decrease in cortisol in the alcohol
and cannabis group could also be attributed to the passing of
time, but this decrease was not seen in controls. Cortisol levels
in the control group before and after exposure actually did not
significantly differ from each other. Furthermore, a previous
study was conducted that analyzed circadian cortisol levels in
a group of healthy participants (N = 33) to define the param-
eters of physiological cortisol secretion (Debono et al. 2009).
All participants had undergone detailed, 24-h, 20-min, cortisol
profiling and serum cortisol levels between 13 and 14 o’ clock
were approximately between 244.55–199.50 nmol/L, respec-
tively, indicating a decrease of 45.05 nmol/L in 60 min. In the
current study, serum cortisol level decreases in the alcohol
(88.81 nmol/L) and cannabis group (56.75 nmol/L) were larg-
er compared to the results of Debono et al. (2009) suggesting
that the decrease in cortisol levels after aggression exposure
was not exclusively due to the passing of time. In the current
study, changes in neuroendocrine measures and alcohol- or
cannabis-induced aggression did not significantly correlate,
which suggests that both phenomena are unrelated. Future
research however in larger samples of both males and females
is needed to investigate the relation between intoxicated ag-
gression and associated changes in testosterone and cortisol
levels in more detail. A further limitation of the current study
is that it did not assess the effect of higher doses of alcohol and
cannabis on aggression. As a final limitation, we note that the
sample sizes of the current groups may have been too low to
detect all potential but small effects of cannabis and alcohol on
behavioral measures of aggression.
The results in the present study support the hypothesis that
acute alcohol intoxication increases feelings of aggression and
that acute cannabis intoxication reduces feelings of aggression
following aggression exposure. Future studies examining the
drug-aggression relationship should investigate additional
variables, such as consumption patterns of alcohol and drug
use, different alcohol and/or drug doses, combined with neu-
roendocrine measures associated with aggression. A multi-
causal approach might be more effective in identifying healthy
individuals who are particularly at risk of engaging in intoxi-
cated aggression following exposure to aggression.
