Background. Many successful ultra-endurance athletes have switched from a high-
carbohydrate to a low-carbohydrate diet, but they have not previously been studied to
determine the extent of metabolic adaptations.
Methods. Twenty elite ultra-marathoners and ironman distance triathletes performed a
maximal graded exercise test and a 180 min submaximal run at 64% VO2max on a treadmill
to determine metabolic responses. One group habitually consumed a traditional high-
carbohydrate (HC: n = 10, %carbohydrate:protein:fat = 59:14:25) diet, and the other a low-
carbohydrate (LC; n = 10, 10:19:70) diet for an average of 20 months (range 9 to 36 months).
Results. Peak fat oxidation was 2.3-fold higher in the LC group (1.54 ± 0.18 vs 0.67 ±
0.14 g/min; P = 0.000) and it occurred at a higher percentage of VO2max (70.3 ± 6.3 vs 54.9 ±
7.8%; P = 0.000). Mean fat oxidation during submaximal exercise was 59% higher in the LC
group (1.21 ± 0.02 vs 0.76 ± 0.11 g/min; P = 0.000) corresponding to a greater relative
contribution of fat (88 ± 2 vs 56 ± 8%; P = 0.000). Despite these marked differences in fuel
use between LC and HC athletes, there were no significant differences in resting muscle
glycogen and the level of depletion after 180 min of running (−64% from pre-exercise) and
120 min of recovery (−36% from pre-exercise).
Conclusion. Compared to highly trained ultra-endurance athletes consuming an HC diet,
long-term keto-adaptation results in extraordinarily high rates of fat oxidation, whereas
muscle glycogen utilization and repletion patterns during and after a 3 hour run are similar.

Introduction
The concept that a diet high in carbohydrate is necessary for
optimizing exercise performance gained credence in the late
1960s when it was discovered that muscle glycogen depletion
was associated with fatigue, and that a high-carbohydrate
diet maintained muscle glycogen and performance [1–3].
Decades later, a great deal of evidence has accumulated in
support of consuming carbohydrate before, during and after
exercise [4,5]. Textbooks and position statements [6] reinforce
the supremacy of the high-carbohydrate fueling paradigm for
maximizing performance and recovery.
Less appreciated is the perspective that there is no
essential
requirement
for
dietary
carbohydrate
because
humans possess a robust capacity to adapt to low carbohy-
drate availability. Around the same time the importance of
glycogen was recognized in the 1960s, ground-breaking work
on the metabolic adaptations to starvation revealed an
elegant mechanism by which humans switch to using lipid-
based fuels [7]. After a few weeks of starvation when glycogen
levels
significantly
decrease,
hepatic
ketone
production
increases dramatically to displace glucose as the brain's
primary energy source, while fatty acids supply the majority
of energy for skeletal muscle. Glucose production from non-
carbohydrate sources via gluconeogenesis supplies carbons
for the few cells dependent on glycolysis. Similar metabolic
adaptations favoring near-exclusive reliance on lipid-based
fuels occur after several weeks of a ketogenic diet when
carbohydrate is restricted to very low levels, protein is kept
moderate, and dietary fat is emphasized [8–10].
A critical mass of experimental data on ketogenic diets and
ketone physiology has been generated in the last decade
demonstrating the safety and therapeutic efficacy in manag-
ing a range of clinical conditions [11–13]. Beyond the clinical
applications, it was demonstrated more than three decades
ago that consumption of a ketogenic diet with less than 10 g
of carbohydrate per day for 4 weeks did not compromise
endurance performance in elite cyclists [10]. These keto-
adapted cyclists derived >90% of their fuel from the oxidation
of fat while exercising at 64% maximal oxygen consumption,
corresponding to an average fat oxidation of 1.5 g/min.
Maximal rates of fat oxidation in humans are generally
thought to be much less, even in highly trained endurance
athletes with very high aerobic capacity. In the largest study
to date that examined peak rates of fat oxidation during
exercise, the highest reported value in any single individual
was 1.0 g/min [14], 50% lower than the mean value recorded
for five keto-adapted cyclists [10]. A handful of other studies
have examined diets lower in carbohydrate and higher in fat
on
metabolism
during
exercise
[15–18].
Although
these
studies consistently show greater fat oxidation, values are
well below previously reported maximal rates [10]. This is
likely due to a higher carbohydrate intake and insufficient
time to allow full keto-adaptation, thus resulting in less
pronounced shifts in fuel use.
There is a distinct lack of research on keto-adapted
athletes who have been restricting carbohydrate for several
consecutive months despite the fact that many endurance
athletes have adopted a low-carbohydrate lifestyle in the past
few years. Metabolic studies in this group may yield new
insights into human capacities to adapt and thrive under
different nutritional inputs. Therefore, we designed the
FASTER (Fat Adapted Substrate use in Trained Elite Runners)
study to compare metabolic differences between competitive
ultra-marathoners and ironman distance triathletes consum-
ing low-carbohydrate (LC) and high-carbohydrate (HC) diets.

Methods
2.1.
Experimental Approach
This was a cross-sectional study comparing two groups of
elite ultra-endurance athletes habitually consuming either an
LC or HC diet. Athletes were carefully matched for age,
physical characteristics, primary competition distance, and
competition times. With one exception, all athletes lived in
the United States and traveled via plane or car to our
laboratory for two consecutive days of testing. On Day 1,
participants performed a maximal oxygen consumption test
during which peak fat oxidation was determined. Day 2
consisted of a treadmill run at 64% of maximal oxygen
consumption for 3 hours to determine metabolic responses
before, during, and after exercise. Subjects were informed of
the purpose and possible risks of the investigation prior to
signing an informed consent document approved by the
institutional review board.
2.2.
Participants
We targeted male ultra-endurance runners 21–45 years of age
consuming an LC (n = 10) or an HC (n = 10) diet who were in
the top 10% of finalists competing in sanctioned running
events ≥50 km and/or triathlons of at least half ironman
distance (113 km). Several athletes had sponsors (55%), course
records (30%), national records (10%), international records
(10%), and national/international-level appearance for Team
USA (25%). Interested athletes completed questionnaires to
assess their medical, diet, training, and running competition
histories. As a pre-screening technique to determine if
participants
met
dietary
inclusion
criteria,
a
registered
dietitian had at least one phone call and email communica-
tion with each athlete about their habitual diet. Eligible
participants were required to measure and weigh all foods
consumed and provide a detailed description for 3 days
(2 weekdays and 1 weekend day). All subjects were contacted
through phone calls and emails to obtain home recipes, local
restaurant menus, and nutritional information as necessary
for determining accurate nutrient information. Habitual diet
information was entered into commercial nutrient analysis
software (Nutritionist Pro™, Axxya Systems, Stafford, TX).
Subjects consuming an LC diet, defined as <20% energy from
carbohydrate and >60% from fat, consistently for at least
6 months were eligible for the LC group. Subjects consistently
consuming >55% energy from carbohydrate were considered
for the HC group. Athletes were excluded if they did not
consume the appropriate diet for the allotted amount of time or
had any health issues, including, but not limited to diabetes,

 heart disease, kidney, liver, or other metabolic or endocrine
dysfunction, current injury, anti-inflammatory medication use,
anabolic drug use, or prone to excessive bleeding.
2.3.
Exercise Protocols
2.3.1.
Maximal Aerobic Capacity
Athletes were in racing condition but refrained from any
competitions for a minimum of 7 days prior to testing. They
were instructed to maintain their habitual diet leading up to
testing and to record their diet for the day before and the day
of travel (Testing Day 1). Subjects arrived at the laboratory
between 1600 and 1900 hours following a 4 hour fast. Upon
arrival, height and body weight were recorded, after which
athletes were familiarized with the equipment and proce-
dures prior to completing a maximal oxygen consumption
(VO2max) test on a motorized treadmill (956i Treadmill,
Precor, Woodinville, WA) using indirect calorimetry (TrueOne
2400, ParvoMedics, Sandy, UT). Subjects were fitted with a
facemask and headgear (7450 Series Silicone V2™ Oro-Nasal
Mask, Hans Rudolph, Shawnee, KS) with an adaptor ring to
attach the two-way air chamber and gas collection hose to the
mask (Adapter 7450 V2™, Hans Rudolph, Shawnee, KS). The
protocol involved a 3 min walking warm-up at 3.5 mph,
followed by 2 min stages that incrementally increased speed
and incline linearly to elicit ~5% increase in VO2 at each stage.
The test was considered complete when subjects voluntarily
stopped the treadmill, which occurred within 18 min. Ratings
of perceived exertion (RPE) on a 0–10 scale and heart rate were
measured at each stage.
Breath-by-breath gas exchange measurements of VO2 and
VCO2 were collected and recorded every 30 s and used to
calculate oxygen uptake, minute ventilation, carbohydrate
and fat oxidation rates, and respiratory exchange ratio (RER)
with the assumption that the urinary nitrogen excretion was
negligible. Peak fat oxidation was determined from the
highest recorded 30 s interval. Following testing, subjects
consumed a meal (dinner) consistent with the macronutrient
percentages of their habitual diet. After dinner, all subjects
were instructed to fast overnight, restrict caffeine and abstain
from
taking
over-the-counter
medications.
To
ensure
hydration, liberal consumption of water was strongly encour-
aged for the rest of the evening.
2.3.2.
Submaximal Exercise Protocol
Athletes returned to the laboratory for testing the following
morning at 0600 after a 10 hour overnight fast (Fig. 1). Each
subject provided a small urine sample to assess specific
gravity (Model A300CL, Spartan, Japan) as a measure of
hydration (all subjects had a USG <1.025). Body composition
was determined via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)
(Prodigy, Lunar Corporation, Madison, WI), height was mea-
sured to the nearest 0.1 cm and total body weight was
recorded to the nearest 0.1 kg on a digital scale (OHAUS,
Fordham Park, NJ). The facemask and headgear were used to
determine resting energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry
for 10 min after which a seated blood sample was obtained
from a forearm vein. Subjects were then moved to a hospital
bed for muscle biopsy preparation and acquisition.
After these baseline measures, subjects consumed a shake
(5 kcal/kg body mass) with a macronutrient distribution
(%carbohydrate:fat:protein) of 5:81:14 in the LC group and
50:36:14 in the HC group. On average, this translated into
shakes consisting of 343 kcal, 4.3 g carbohydrate, 31.3 g fat,
and 12.6 g protein for the LC group and 332 kcal, 42.7 g
carbohydrate, 13.7 g fat, and 12.4 g protein in the HC group.
Proportions varied, but both the LC and HC shakes were made
from heavy cream, olive oil, whey protein, walnut oil, and
strawberries. The HC shake also contained banana and agave
syrup. Subjects rested quietly for 90 min after ingestion of the
shake. Indirect calorimetry measurements were taken during
the last 10 min and a second pre-exercise blood sample
was taken.
Subjects then moved to the treadmill and began running at
an intensity equivalent to 64% VO2max for 180 min. Slight
adjustments to the pace were made during the first 10 min
based on real-time measurements of oxygen uptake. During
the endurance exercise test, subjects were allowed to drink
water ad libitum but no other nutritional supplementation
was consumed. The treadmill was stopped briefly at 60 and
120 min to obtain blood. Heart rate and RPE were recorded
every 30 min, and indirect calorimetry measurements were

 obtained for 10 min at the following intervals: 50–60, 110–120,
140–150, and 170–180 min.
After 180 min of running, subjects moved to a wheel chair
and blood was obtained immediately. Subjects were moved to
a bed and a second muscle biopsy was performed ~15 min
after completing the run. Subjects then consumed a shake
identical to the pre-run shake. Indirect calorimetry measure-
ments and blood were taken at 30, 60, and 120 min post-
exercise. A final muscle biopsy was taken 120 min post-
exercise. The entire day of testing lasted about 8 hours
finishing mid-afternoon (see Fig. 1), which is the primary
reason for including the shakes before and after exercise since
no other caloric intake was allowed during testing.
2.4.
Blood Draws and Muscle Biopsies
An indwelling Teflon cannula or a 21G butterfly needle was
inserted into an antecubital vein of the subject. The intravenous
line was kept patent with normal saline solution flushes. Prior
to each blood draw, 3 mL of blood was extracted and discarded
to avoid inadvertent saline dilution of the blood. During each
draw, blood was collected into appropriate tubes to allow
for whole blood, serum, and plasma analyses. Blood was
centrifuged at 1500g for 15 min and 4 °C, aliquoted into storage
tubes, and stored in ultra-low freezers for batch analysis.
Muscle biopsies were obtained from the superficial portion
of the vastus lateralis using the percutaneous needle tech-
nique with suction. The biopsy site was prepped and the skin
was anesthetized by a local subcutaneous injection of 2%
lidocaine hydrochloride. A small incision (~1 cm) was made
through the skin and muscle fascia and a 5 mm diameter
sterile
biopsy
needle
(Surgical
Instruments
Engineering,
Midlothian, United Kingdom) was introduced into the muscle
to a depth of ~2 cm. To ensure adequate sample sizes a
double-chop method combined with suction was used. The
muscle sample was removed from the needle and divided
into multiple pieces of roughly equal size. The specimens
were cleaned of connective tissue and blood, flash frozen in
liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C for later determination of
glycogen. The incision was covered with sterile gauze and
compression was applied to prevent bleeding. The incision was
then closed with a single suture. In order to avoid possible
impairment of glycogen synthesis resulting from microtrauma
in the area near the biopsy [19], we performed the immediate
post-exercise biopsy on the opposite leg, and the 2 hour post-
exercise biopsy 3 cm apart from the first incision site.

Biochemical Analyses
Frozen samples were thawed only once before analysis.
Plasma glucose and triglycerides were measured using a
Cobas C 111 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis IN).
Serum insulin was analyzed by ELISA (Calbiotech, Spring
Valley, CA). Serum glycerol (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor,
MI), ketones and total non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) (Wako
Diagnostics, Mountain View, CA) were analyzed by enzymatic
assays. Insulin, ketones, lactate, NEFA, and glycerol had intra-
assay
CVs
of
4.31%,
6.40%,
4.65%,
4.51%
and
5.31%
respectively. All samples were run in duplicate except for
those measured on Cobas. Glucose and insulin values were
used to calculate an index of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR;
calculated as glucose (mmol/L)∙insulin (μIU/mL)/22.5] from the
baseline resting sample [20]. Glycogen was determined from a
portion of muscle (10 mg) that was hydrolyzed in 500 μL of
2 N HCl by heating at 99 °C for 2 hours, with occasional
vortexing. Any weight lost to heating was replaced using
ddH2O. The solution was neutralized with 500 μL of 2 N NaOH
and 50 μL of Tris buffer (pH 6.5). 1 mL of glucose hexokinase
reagent (ThermoFisher), including 20 μL of supernatant of the
hydrolysis product was prepared, and the free glycosyl units
were then spectrophotometrically assayed in triplicate at
340 nm on a Nanodrop 2000c spectrophotometer [21]. Coeffi-
cient of variation was 4.2%.
2.6.
Statistical Analyses
Independent t-tests were used to examine differences be-
tween LC and HC groups for dietary intake and physical
characteristics. For biochemical responses to exercise, we
used a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance with
group (HC and LC) as a between factor and time (i.e., exercise-
induced responses) as a within factor. Fisher's least signifi-
cant difference post hoc was used to examine pairwise
comparisons when significant main or interaction effects
were observed. The alpha level for significance was set at
P ≤ 0.05.

Results
3.1.
Subject Characteristics and Habitual Diet
There were no significant differences between groups in
physical characteristics or aerobic capacity (Table 1). Two
athletes in each group were ironman distance triathletes
while the remainder competed primarily in running events
ranging from 80 to 161 km (50 to 100 miles). The main
difference between groups was their habitual diet (Table 2).
Average time on an LC diet was 20 months (range 9 to
36 months). In the LC group, an overwhelming majority of
energy intake was derived from fat (70%), primarily saturated
and monounsaturated fatty acids. Only ~10% of their energy
intake was from carbohydrate. Conversely, the HC group
consumed over half their energy as carbohydrate (59%).
Absolute protein was not significantly different between
groups, but LC athletes consumed a greater relative amount
than HC athletes (19 vs 14% of total energy). Daily nutrient
intake determined from food records of the 2 days prior to
testing showed similar dietary patterns as the habitual diet
and was not significantly different (Supplementary Table 1).

Peak Fat Oxidation
Peak fat oxidation was on average 2.3-fold higher in the LC
group (1.54 ± 0.18 vs 0.67 ± 0.14 g/min; P = 0.000), with every
subject in the LC group (range 1.15 to 1.74 g/min) exceeding the
highest value in the HC group (range 0.40 to 0.87 g/min) (Fig. 2A).

(70.3 ± 6.3 vs 54.9 ± 7.8%; P = 0.000) (Fig. 2B).
3.3.
Submaximal Substrate Oxidation
All 20 subjects completed 180 min of running. The average percent
maximum oxygen consumption during exercise was similar in the
LC (64.7 ± 0.0%) and HC (64.3 ± 0.0%) groups. Ratings of perceived
exertion over the 3 hour run were also similar between groups
gradually increasing from 3.0 ± 1.3 at the start of exercise to 5.1 ±
1.9 at the end of exercise in the LC group and from 2.9 ± 0.9 to
5.2 ± 2.9 in the HC group. Absolute energy expenditure during the
run was not different between the LC (12.4 ± 0.1 kcal/min) and HC
(12.2 ± 0.2) groups; however, substrate oxidation patterns at rest
and during exercise were significantly different (Fig. 3). At rest prior
to exercise, the RER was significantly (P = 0.000) lower in the LC
(0.72 ±0.05) than the HC (0.86 ± 0.08) group, indicating a contribu-
tion from fat of 95 vs 47%, respectively. During 3 hours of exercise,
RER fluctuated between 0.73 and 0.74 translating into relatively
stable and higher fat oxidation rates of ~1.2 g/min in the LC group,
whereas fat oxidation values were significantly lower in the HC
group at all time points (Fig. 3A). The rate of carbohydrate
oxidation in the LC group was stable during exercise and
significantly (P = 0.000) lower than the HC group (Fig. 3B). The
average contribution of fat during exercise in the LC and HC groups
were 88% and 56%, respectively.

Circulating Metabolites
Circulating

of
lipid
metabolism
indicated
a
significantly greater level of ketogenesis (Fig. 4A) and lipolysis
(Fig. 4B) in the LC athletes. Serum non-esterified fatty acids
were higher at the start of exercise in LC athletes, but peak
levels at the end of exercise were not significantly different
between groups (Fig. 4C). Plasma triglycerides were not
different between groups (Fig. 4D).
Plasma glucose and serum insulin were not significantly
different between groups at rest and during exercise but
increased during the last hour of recovery
in the HC
athletes, likely due to the greater amount of carbohydrate in
the shake (Fig. 5A and B). There was no significant difference
between groups in insulin resistance as determined by HOMA.
Serum lactate responses were variable, but were significantly
higher in LC athletes during the last hour of exercise (Fig. 5C).

Muscle Glycogen
Compared to baseline, muscle glycogen was significantly de-
creased by 62% immediately post-exercise and 38% at 2 hours
post-exercise in the HC group. The LC group exhibited a similar
pattern; muscle glycogen was decreased by 66% immediately
post-exercise and 34% at 2 hours post-exercise (Fig. 6A). There
were no significant differences in pre-exercise or post-exercise
glycogen concentrations between groups. There was a high
degree of variability in muscle glycogen concentrations pre-
exercise in both groups. In contrast, the depletion and resynthesis
patterns showed a more uniform response, especially the amount
of glycogen synthesized during the 2 hour recovery period in LC
athletes (44.8 ± 7.5; 95% CI 40.2–49.4 μmol/g w.w.), which was one-
third less variable than HC athletes (34.6 ± 23.9; 95% CI 19.8–
49.4 μmol/g w.w.) (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, in all ten LC athletes the
total amount of carbohydrate oxidized during the 3 hour run as
calculated from indirect calorimetry (mean ± SD; 64 ± 25 g) was
lower than the total amount of glycogen disappearance (mean ±
SD; 168 ± 65 g), assuming 10 kg of active tissue.

Discussion
We studied two groups of highly trained competitive ultra-
endurance athletes who were well matched in regard to
training status and physical characteristics. The main differ-
ence was that the LC athletes consumed 6-times less dietary
carbohydrate than LC athletes (82 vs 684 g/day) for an average
of 20 months. The most notable findings were that compared
to HC athletes, the LC keto-adapted runners showed: (1) two-
fold higher rates of peak fat oxidation during graded exercise,
(2) greater capacity to oxidize fat at higher exercise intensi-
ties, (3) two-fold higher rates of fat oxidation during sustained
submaximal running, and (4) no differences in pre-exercise
muscle glycogen concentrations, the rate of glycogen utiliza-
tion during exercise, and the rate of glycogen synthesis during
recovery. Thus, we show for the first time that chronic keto-
adaptation in elite ultra-endurance athletes is associated with
a robust capacity to increase fat oxidation during exercise
while
maintaining
normal
skeletal
muscle
glycogen
concentrations.
The whole body maximal fat oxidation rates in the LC
athletes were similar to those observed in elite keto-adapted
cyclists [10], which are noteworthy considering they are ~50%
higher than previously reported maximal rates of fat oxida-
tion in the literature [14]. During submaximal exercise, fat
contributed to 88% vs 56% of energy expended in LC and HC
athletes,
respectively.
Several
studies
have
consistently
reported that short-term consumption of a high-fat diet in
highly trained endurance athletes increases fat oxidation

 during submaximal exercise (reviewed in Ref. [22]). However,
no studies have showed the same degree of shift toward fat
oxidation as observed in LC athletes reported here. In the LC
ultra-endurance runners studied here, a combination of
greater degree of carbohydrate restriction and longer period
of adaptation likely resulted in a more robust capacity for fat
oxidation during exercise.
Serum glycerol and non-esterified fatty acid concentra-
tions increased rapidly during exercise and decreased during
recovery. Whereas fatty acids were similar between groups,
glycerol concentrations were ~2-fold higher in LC athletes.
Phinney et al. [10] also reported similar circulating fatty acids
concentrations
before
and
after
keto-adaptation.
Serum
glycerol is a better indicator of adipose tissue lipolysis
compared to fatty acids since adipose tissue and skeletal
muscles have lower glycerol kinase activity and thus are not
able to use glycerol as effectively. Still some reports suggest
that muscle can use circulating glycerol for intramuscular
triglyceride synthesis [23]. Previous studies have indicated a
greater capacity to transport circulating fatty acids into
muscle after a short-term low-carbohydrate/high-fat diet
[24,15]. Thus, these data indicate a higher rate of adipose
tissue lipolysis in LC athletes resulting in a greater release of
both glycerol and fatty acids into the circulation, with greater
overall uptake of fatty acids into skeletal muscle.
Carbohydrate oxidation was significantly lower in the LC
ultra-endurance runners, but unexpectedly muscle glycogen
concentrations were not different between groups. It was
previously reported that a 4 week ketogenic diet in elite
cyclists decreased resting muscle glycogen by half and the
rate of glycogen use during exercise by 4-fold [10]. Other
studies have shown that a low-carbohydrate/high-fat diet
decreases resting glycogen and the rate of glycogen use
during submaximal exercise [15,25]. The duration of the LC
diet was shorter (4 weeks) in the work by Phinney et al. [10],
suggesting that complete adaptations in glycogen homeosta-
sis and kinetics may take several months. The different
glycogen responses could also be due to lower carbohydrate
intake, which was <10 g/day in cyclists [10] versus 86 g/day in
the LC runners. A short-term glycogen loading effect is
unlikely since food logs were recorded for the two days
leading up to testing and indicated the average carbohydrate
intake was 64 g/day in LC athletes (Supplementary Table 1).
The small relative contribution of carbohydrate to energy
expenditure in LC athletes, but similar use of glycogen as HC
athletes, indicates a decreased reliance on circulating glucose
in the keto-adapted athlete.
The muscle glycogen responses in the LC athletes share
some similarities to that of highly trained Alaskan sled dogs
[26,27]. Sled dogs have an innately high endurance capacity

 and often perform several hours of running at submaximal
intensity while consuming a high-fat/low-carbohydrate diet.
Dogs running 160 km/day for 5 days showed no cumulative
muscle glycogen depletion despite eating a diet consisting of
only 15% carbohydrate [26]. In a subsequent study [27], dogs
ran 140 km/day for 4 days and showed a 66% reduction in
muscle glycogen after the first 140 km run (similar to the 64%
reduction in muscle glycogen in the LC athletes) and a
progressive increase in muscle glycogen over subsequent
days of running. A more recent study reported that trained
Alaskan sled dogs
eating a
16% carb diet
showed an
unexpected
high
rate
of
carbohydrate
oxidation
during
exercise that was associated with a significant increase in
gluconeogenesis from glycerol and increased lactate oxida-
tion [28]. Thus, highly trained high-fat adapted sled dogs
show very different fuel utilization patterns than would be
predicted based on studies done in trained humans eating a
high-carbohydrate diet.
A provocative finding was that LC athletes appeared to
break down substantially more glycogen (>100 g) than the
total amount of carbohydrate oxidized during the 3 hour run.
This was the case in all ten LC athletes. Why would athletes
with high rates of acetyl CoA generation from fatty acids
bother breaking down muscle glycogen if those carbons are
not terminally oxidized? Although speculative, we believe
that the reason may be to provide a source of glucose for the
pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and a source of pyruvate to
form oxaloacetate. The PPP generates important 5 carbon
sugars and reducing power (i.e., NADPH) for biosynthetic
reactions such as ribonucleic acid synthesis and maintaining
glutathione levels, respectively. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
and fructose 1,6 bisphosphate generated from the PPP can
also enter glycolysis after the energy input stage, thereby
generating ATP through substrate level phosphorylation and
increasing formation of pyruvate. Pyruvate may be necessary
in a keto-adapted athlete for two reasons. First, pyruvate can
be used as an anaplerotic substrate by pyruvate carboxylase
to generate oxaloacetate. At the onset of exercise several TCA
cycle
intermediates
increase
in
concentration
including
fumarate, citrate and malate, however oxaloacetate remains
low. Thus, in the keto-adapted athlete glycogen breakdown
may be necessary to ensure a constant source of oxaloacetate
for
optimal
TCA
functioning.
Second,
pyruvate
can
be
converted to lactate or alanine in muscle, which may then
serve as gluconeogenic substrate for the liver.
Rates of muscle glycogen synthesis in humans are highest
when large amounts of carbohydrate are consumed immedi-
ately post-exercise [29], yet the LC athletes had similar rates
of glycogen repletion compared to the HC athletes, despite
receiving a negligible amount of carbohydrate after exercise
(4 vs 43 g) and more fat (31 vs 14 g). When no carbohydrate or
energy is provided after prolonged exercise, a small amount
of muscle glycogen synthesis occurs [30] presumably due to
hepatic gluconeogenesis providing a source of glucose for
glycogen.
Horses
supplemented
with
fat
after
exercise
showed impaired glycogen synthesis, but 3 weeks of a high-
fat diet resulted in similar glycogen repletion as horses fed a
high-carbohydrate diet [31]. An obvious question that arises is
what is the carbon source for glycogen synthesis in the
absence of carbohydrate intake post-exercise?
Although
speculative, lactate and/or glycerol, which were two-fold
higher at the end of exercise in LC athletes and then
sharply decreased during recovery, may have provided a
source of carbons for glycogen synthesis during recovery
[32]. Lactate conversion to glycogen could occur directly
(lactate glyconeogenesis) or indirectly via the Cori cycle.
Interestingly, lactate and ketones are both transported
across
cell
membranes by monocarboxylic acid trans-
porters, which are upregulated after a ketogenic diet [33].
Lactate was shown to account for up to 18% of skeletal
muscle glycogen synthesized after high-intensity exercise
[34]. It could be that lactate rapidly replenished liver
glycogen and it has an ability to maintain hepatic glucose
output in the face of limited exogenous carbohydrate intake.
Regardless of the mechanism, these results suggest that
long-term consumption of a low-carbohydrate/high-fat diet
in highly trained ultra-marathoners results in adaptations in
the homeostatic regulation of muscle glycogen that acts to
preserve levels similar to those observed when exogenous
carbohydrate availability is high.

 LC athletes had ~3-fold higher levels of circulating beta-
hydroxybutyrate and total ketones at rest, during exercise, and
recovery. As expected, ketone levels increased progressively
during exercise and peaked 30 min into recovery consistent with
the previously reported post-exercise ketosis, also referred to as
the Courtice–Douglas effect [35]. When ketone levels exceed
0.5 mmol/L, they become a preferred fuel for the brain [36]. Since
ketones are derived from fatty acids, the keto-adapted athlete has
access to and an ability to utilize a stable, abundant source of fuel
in the form of beta-hydroxybutyrate. Beyond its role as a
metabolite, beta-hydroxybutyrate in the range of concentrations
observed in the LC athletes has recently been shown to be a
potent
inhibitor
of
histone
deacetylases,
which
in
turn
upregulates expression of antioxidant genes [37]. It has also been
observed that beta-hydroxybutyrate is associated with a reduc-
tion in the generation of reactive oxygen species by mitochondria
[38]. It remains to be demonstrated whether LC athletes derive
benefit in terms of cognitive function or recovery from these
unique metabolic and signaling effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate.
Since this was a cross-sectional study it is possible that LC
athletes had naturally higher rates of fat oxidation or were
somehow better suited to respond to a low-carbohydrate diet.
Long-term prospective diet intervention studies would be
helpful to better understand the time course and variability in
adaptations to a low-carbohydrate diet. While we showed
distinct differences in metabolic responses between LC and
HC athletes, we did not measure performance. It will be
important for future work to address a range of performance
outcomes from endurance to anaerobic capacity to strength/
power, as well as sport and/or military-specific tasks. All the
LC athletes were initially high-carbohydrate athletes. Thus,
they made the choice to switch to a very low-carbohydrate
diet and had enough self-perceived benefit to continue this
lifestyle. From a practical standpoint, these observations
broaden the dietary options available for endurance athletes
to include a very low level of carbohydrate.
In summary, these results provide the first documentation
of the metabolic adaptations associated with long-term con-
sumption of a very low-carbohydrate/high-fat diet in highly
trained keto-adapted ultra-endurance athletes. The enhanced
ability to oxidize fat during exercise across a range of intensities
is striking, as is the ability to maintain “normal” glycogen
concentrations in the context of limited carbohydrate intake.
Keto-adaptation provides an alternative to the supremacy of
the high-carbohydrate paradigm for endurance athletes.
