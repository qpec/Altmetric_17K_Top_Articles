Abstract When a human catches a ball, they estimate future target location based on the
current trajectory. How animals, small and large, encode such predictive processes at the single
neuron level is unknown. Here we describe small target-selective neurons in predatory dragonflies
that exhibit localized enhanced sensitivity for targets displaced to new locations just ahead of the
prior path, with suppression elsewhere in the surround. This focused region of gain modulation is
driven by predictive mechanisms, with the direction tuning shifting selectively to match the target’s
prior path. It involves a large local increase in contrast gain which spreads forward after a delay
(e.g. an occlusion) and can even transfer between brain hemispheres, predicting trajectories moved
towards the visual midline from the other eye. The tractable nature of dragonflies for physiological
experiments makes this a useful model for studying the neuronal mechanisms underlying the
brain’s remarkable ability to anticipate moving stimuli.

Introduction
A diverse range of animals are capable of visually detecting moving objects within cluttered environ-
ments. This discrimination is a complex task, particularly in response to a small target generating
very weak contrast as it moves against a highly textured background. The neural processing underly-
ing this behavior must enhance a localized, weak and variable signal, which may only stimulate one
or two photoreceptors in turn. Rather than simply respond reactively, some animals even anticipate
a target’s path by predicting its future location. In the vertebrate retina, high initial gain combined
with neuronal adaptation and sensitization allows responses from a network of overlapping ganglion
cells to ‘keep up’ with the current target location and account for sluggish neuronal delays
(Berry et al., 1999; Kastner and Baccus, 2013). This encoding anticipates targets moving in a
straight line, with trajectory reversals eliciting a synchronous burst of activity from a population of
ganglion cells (Schwartz et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2014). However, this anticipation does not use
the recent trajectory to extrapolate likely target locations at future times. Rather, the last observed
location remains sensitized after the target disappears. This differs from studies of human observers,
where a temporarily occluded target results in improved sensitivity at the extrapolated forward loca-
tion (Watamaniuk and McKee, 1995). This predictive encoding of future target locations indicates
the presence of additional processing mechanisms beyond the retina.
Like human ball players, dragonflies also estimate target location, capturing single prey in visual
clutter, even amidst a swarm of potential alternatives (Corbet, 1999). We recently described a ‘win-
ner-takes-all’ neuron in the dragonfly likely to subserve such competitive selection of an individual
target, whilst ignoring a distracter (Wiederman and O’Carroll, 2013). In other animal models, inhibi-
tory circuits drive the selection of salient stimuli (Mysore and Knudsen, 2013) and the direction of
attention towards targets is evidenced by modulation of contrast gain (Moran and Desimone,
1985; Reynolds et al., 2000). How prediction relates to the selection of salient stimuli is unknown

 (Zirnsak et al., 2014) and how selection, prediction and attention are encoded at the neuronal level
is an intense topic of scientific investigation.
Here we used intact, in vivo, recordings from the system of small target-selective neurons in pred-
atory dragonflies to reveal local changes in sensitivity elicited during target tracking. We show that
this involves a large increase in contrast gain just ahead of the target’s most recent location, with
suppression in the surround. We investigated the spatial extent, temporal persistence and direction
tuning within this region of enhancement. Our data shows that a local increase in gain spreads for-
ward after a delay, even anticipating the path of primers presented to the contralateral eye and
moved towards the visual midline. Moreover, the direction tuning shifts to match the prior path.
Such response attributes differentiate this neuronal processing from typical models of direction
selectivity and are ideally suited for a dragonfly’s predictive pursuit of prey (Mischiati et al., 2015).
Results
Receptive fields are modulated by stimulus history
‘Small target motion detector’ (STMD) neurons in the dragonfly, Hemicordulia tau, are tuned to tar-
get size and velocity and are highly sensitive to contrast (O’Carroll 1993, Wiederman et al., 2008,
2013). One identified STMD, CSTMD1, responds selectively to a small, moving target, even when
embedded within natural scenes (Wiederman and O’Carroll, 2011). CSTMD1 also exhibits a sophis-
ticated form of selective attention. The neuronal response to the presentation of two simultaneously
moving targets does not simply result in either neuronal summation or inhibition. Instead, CSTMD1
responds in a winner-takes-all manner, selecting a single target as if the distracter does not even
exist (Wiederman and O’Carroll, 2013).
We mapped CSTMD1’s receptive field by measuring spiking activity in response to a single,
black, square target (1.5˚x1.5˚) moving along trajectories at varying spatial locations in the visual
eLife digest Catching a ball requires a person to track the speed and direction of a small
moving target often against a cluttered and varying background. Predatory insects, like dragonflies,
face a similar challenge when they pursue their prey through the air. The task is made a little easier,
however, by the fact that most moving targets tend to follow predictable trajectories. Indeed,
animals are also better at tracking targets that follow smooth continuous trajectories, suggesting
that brains have evolved to exploit the normal behavior of visual stimuli to reduce their workload
To find out how this process works, Wiederman, Fabian et al. studied the brains of dragonflies as
they watched a black square intended to mimic prey. Brain cells called Small Target Motion
Detectors (or STMD neurons for short) became more active in response to the target. But rather
than simply following the target, the STMD neurons instead predicted its future location. In fact,
individual neurons were more sensitive to movements occurring just ahead of the target’s current
position, and less sensitive to movements occurring elsewhere.
If the target abruptly disappeared, the point in space where the neurons were most sensitive to
movement continued to gradually move forward over time. Given that real-life targets typically
disappear when they move behind other objects, this suggests that the brain is predicting where the
target is most likely to reappear. The STMD neurons became more sensitive to movement by
increasing their ability to detect differences in brightness between the target and its background. In
some cases, the neurons increased their sensitivity more than five-fold.
Insects and mammals last shared a common ancestor more than 500 million years ago, and, in
many respects, mammalian brains are substantially more complex than insect brains. Nevertheless,
the results of Wiederman, Fabian et al. show that the insect brain can perform visual tasks that were
previously associated only with mammals. Neuroscientists and engineers have used the insect brain
for decades to study the circuits that support biological processes. In the coming years, insects such
as the dragonfly may enable us to explore how visual regions of the brain predict future events. This
knowledge could ultimately be applied to artificial vision systems, such as those in self-driving cars.

Figure 1. CSTMD1’s receptive field mapped with drifting targets. (A) Small targets (black squares, 1.5˚x1.5˚) move along short trajectories (200 ms) that
are both vertically and horizontally offset on a 10 � 10 grid. Pictograms are illustrative and not to scale. The colormap reveals CSTMD1 responses to
these stimuli producing an ‘unfacilitated’ receptive field (50–150 ms analysis window). (B) Horizontally offset targets are drifted vertically up the monitor
display along long, continuous trajectories eliciting strong, facilitated responses (100 ms bins to corresponding spatial locations in A). (C) Separating
long paths into two components (primer followed by probe), allows us to examine the facilitatory effects within a short analysis window (before the
probe self-primes, green region). In a single neuron, we examined response time courses (mean of 140 replicates over two hours) to repeated probe
alone (blue line) and primer & probe (black line) conditions (D) We have previously described facilitated receptive fields in response to targets drifted
across the entire visual display. Targets moving rightwards (vertically offset) reveal inhibition in one eye’s visual field (in response to motion from the
periphery towards the frontal area) and excitation in the other (from frontal to periphery). (E) The facilitated receptive field mapped with upwards
moving targets (hot colors) is stronger than the weaker, though similarly shaped, unfacilitated receptive field in A. Targets moved upward in the other
visual hemifield inhibit responses to below spontaneous levels (data trace).

 responses at the same corresponding spatial
locations as the short paths in Figure 1A (mean
spike rate over 100 ms bins). This reveals higher
overall spiking activity in response to the long,
continuous target trajectories. Here we investi-
gate this effect of stimulus history by separating
trajectories into components; a primer and a
probe. Each elicit responses when presented
alone, however, the probe’s initial response is
affected by the gain induced by a preceding
primer (Figure 1C). We note that neuronal
responses build slowly over hundreds of millisec-
onds - a property we have previously termed
facilitation (Nordstro
¨m et al., 2011). For the
primer & probe condition (where a primer always
precedes the probe stimulus) responses to the
probe are facilitated (green region, cf. black with
blue time courses). This facilitatory effect is not
simply due to slow kinetics, as both responses
have a rapid decay time course when the stimu-
lus ends (Dunbier et al., 2012).
Previously, we have reported receptive fields
in their facilitated state (Dunbier et al., 2012),
mapped using targets moving along either long
horizontal (Figure 1D) or vertical trajectories (Figure 1E). These reveal CSTMD1’s excitatory recep-
tive field which extends from the dorsal, visual midline to the periphery. Spatial inhomogeneity
within this receptive field (interpolated to reduce binning artefacts) likely results from underlying
dendritic integration and local spatiotemporal tuning differences. In the other visual hemifield (mid-
line at 0˚ azimuth), a drifting target generates inhibition (Figure 1D,E), with activity suppressed to
below spontaneous levels (0 spikes/s from a spontaneous activity of 11 ± 4 spikes/s, mean ± std.).
What is the effect on a 2D array of ‘probe’ responses (short paths in Figure 1A) when a long
primer is presented along a single, constrained, trajectory immediately preceding each probe? Such
an experiment would provide us with a snapshot of the effect of stimulus history (the primer target)
on the current receptive field. Figure 2 provides examples of individual, neuronal responses to short
target trajectories (probes, blue arrows), both with and without a preceding 1 s duration target tra-
jectory (primer, black arrow). For each probe location (in a 10 � 10 grid), we measured the spike
rate within a 100 ms time window (the green shaded regions in Figure 2). The effect of priming was
calculated as the difference (D spike rate) between the probe response when preceded by the
primer (‘primer & probe’, black and blue arrows) and the probe alone (blue arrow) conditions. In this
paradigm, we changed the spatial offset (jumps) between primer and probe without any delay
(Figure 2A,B) or following a 300 ms pause (Figure 2C,D). We also tested a condition where the
primer target drifted toward the dragonfly’s midline, through the visual field of the other eye
(Figure 2E,F). By ensuring primers did not enter the region of binocular overlap, any changes eli-
cited in the probe locations (in the opposing eye) must have traversed brain hemispheres.
Predictive modulation of gain
Figure 3A shows the complete two-dimensional map of primer-induced gain modulation, averaged
across repeated intracellular recordings from CSTMD1 in different animals. Receptive fields are per-
spective-corrected from the dragonfly’s point of view to a dragonfly eye map (mirrored along the
vertical midline) and smoothed using bicubic interpolation to remove binning artefacts. The contour
lines in Figure 3A–C indicate the average unfacilitated responses to the probe alone condition. In
primer & probe trials, the primer target moved upwards (Figure 3A,B, Video 2) or rightwards
(Figure 3C) along different paths in each trial but constrained within a region 5˚ wide (indicated by
the white outlined box). To the CSTMD1 we recorded from (with its excitatory inputs located in the
right mid-brain), upward and rightward moving targets represent progressive stimuli (i.e. moving
from front-to-back). The small variation in primer path decreased local habituation from a repeating
Video 1. Visual stimulus for Figure 1. The receptive
field of CSTMD1 is mapped with a series of targets
drifted on short paths (Figure 1A), or a single target
drifting across the same location on a long path
(Figure 1B). Separating a long target path into two
components (a primer and a probe) allows us to
quantify the facilitation induced by a primer
(Figure 1C). All trials were presented in a randomised
order. In this video trials are presented without rest
periods, whilst in experiments trials were separated by
at least 7 s to minimize habituation.

 primer running over the exact same trajectory. Probe alone and primer & probe trials were randomly
interleaved. The color map reveals the average change in neuronal activity (D spike rate) elicited by
the spatially constrained primer for each probe location (primer & probe – probe alone). Figure 3A
reveals a pronounced ‘focus’ of increased sensitivity just ahead of the final location of the priming
target and an extensive region of suppression in surrounding locations (mean, n = 9 dragonflies).
Thus, what we have previously referred to as facilitation is a more complex phenomenon - local
enhancement with spike rate suppression elicited by probes jumped into the surround. Here we use
the term ‘focus’ to refer to both the local enhancement and widespread concomitant inhibition.
Such neuronal processing may be indicative of an attentional mechanism, rather than a global
arousal or sensitization (Slagter et al., 2016). In Figure 3A, we observed a large mean change in
spike rate – over 50% increase within the focus center (p=0.0007, n = 9) and up to 50% decrease in
surrounding locations (p=0.005, n = 9).
If the primer disappears for 300 ms before each probe, a similarly intense focus is still evident
(Figure 3B, Video 2), but now spread forward in spatial extent (p=0.005, n = 7 dragonflies). The
focus seems to account for the expected target location had it continued on its original trajectory
(to a position as indicated by the white cross-hair in Figure 3B,C), albeit with an increased uncer-
tainty given its broader spatial extent (mean, n = 7 dragonflies). Moreover, if we move a horizontal
primer toward the visual midline in the contralateral eye before it disappears for 300 ms, the focus
transfers across the brain to the ipsilateral hemisphere (Figure 3C). We then observed enhancement
(red) localized to a broad region ahead of the primer trajectory (p=0.004, n = 7 dragonflies), but
strong suppression (blue) at higher elevations (p=0.02, n = 7 dragonflies). Dragonflies have a small
area of binocular overlap between the two eyes corresponding to the frontal/dorsal visual field (Hor-
ridge, 1978). Our stimulus was carefully designed to avoid this region, disappearing just before
entering the area of overlap. Therefore, our result cannot be explained by facilitation being regener-
ated in the ipsilateral eye. Rather it must involve a localized, inter-hemispheric transfer of informa-
tion.

 suppression (red and blue regions in Figure 3C) cannot be explained by a simple global mechanism,
such as, a post-inhibitory rebound following a strong inhibitory stimulus (Bolzon et al., 2009). This
transfer of a predictive focus between brain hemispheres is likely to play a crucial role in the predic-
tion of target location during pursuit flights where the pursuer attempts to fixate the target frontally
(Mischiati et al., 2015). Prolonged pursuit flights of conspecifics involve highly convoluted paths in
which the target may readily cross from one visual field to the other (Land and Collett, 1974). In
Figure 3D, we show the effect sizes of the three maps (Figure 1A–C) at all spatial locations. These
Cohen’s d values are the mean differences between primer & probe and probe alone (D spike rate),
divided by the standard deviation of these differences. Cohen’s d values over 0.5 are considered
large effect sizes, thus our values of up to 1.8 in both excitatory and inhibitory directions are consid-
erable. For particular points in these maps (Figure 3D, +’s) we calculate the paired, two-tailed P-val-
ues, highlighting the statistically significant effect of the primer.
Figure 3E shows data from an additional 12 dragonflies, where we mapped the forward-spread-
ing focus following a delay of either 100 ms or 300 ms along a single dimension. These data (mean ±

Figure 3. A predictive focus facilitates responses to a moving target. (A) The probe receptive field in response to short, vertical trajectories is indicated
by contour lines (mean, n = 9 dragonflies). The color map shows change in spike rate (for each location) due to the immediately preceding primer
trajectory that is presented within the white outlined box. The change in spiking activity in the corresponding analysis window reveals >50%
enhancement in front of the moving target (red), but suppression in the surround (blue). (B) With a 300 ms delay introduced after the primer, the focus
spreads forward (color map, n = 7 dragonflies), estimating the theoretical future target location (white crosshairs). (C) The primer moves toward the
midline in the other eye’s visual field, whilst avoiding binocular overlap. The focus transfers between brain hemispheres, with a spatially-localized
enhancement in front of the target and suppression at higher elevations (color map, n = 7 dragonflies). (D) We examined the statistical significance of
all three mappings (Figure A-C) by calculating the effect size at each spatial location (Cohen’s d). We see values within the range ±1.8, well above those
considered as large effect sizes (>0.5). For spatial points of interest (+), we calculate the corresponding statistical significance (P value) between the
primer & probe and probe alone versions (E) There is a forward shift in the focus region (mean ± SEM, p=0.03, n = 12 dragonflies) following an
occlusion (cf. 100 ms pause, yellow line with 300 ms pause, green line). The expected target locations following occlusions are indicated with color
crosshairs (3˚ for 100 ms and 9˚ for 300 ms).

 SEM) show that a small (6˚) jump backwards pre-
cisely over the previously primed path already
resets the response magnitude to that of the
unfacilitated response (dashed line), whilst larger
jumps backwards (12˚) reveal potent suppression.
Considering that the largest jump in this case is
stimulating a part of the receptive field that last
saw the target up to 700 ms earlier, the profound
inhibition seen for this stimulus suggests that the
prior primer target exerts long-lasting effects on
the surrounding receptive field. Targets that
jump forward after a delay reveal a shift in facili-
tation, spreading further forward after 300 ms
(green line), compared to 100 ms (yellow line).
Examining the mean difference combined across
all forward jumps (6˚, 12˚ and 18˚) reveals a statis-
tically significant difference between 100 ms and
300 ms pauses (p=0.03, Cohen’s d = 0.7). Here
the probe target followed directly ‘on path’ to
the priming stimulus, without the small horizontal
offsets (up to 5˚, Figure 3A–C white priming
region) used previously to limit local habituation.
In another eight dragonflies, instead of con-
straining the position of our primer, we instead tested responses to probes that always landed at
the same location following different primers. This stereotyped probe followed either a jump in
space, a pause in time, or a combination of both tests. Figure 4A–D show normalized response
time-courses from individual CSTMD1 examples. The small 4˚ instantaneous jump ahead of the
primer leads to a response time course with a very rapid rise to a level similar to the fully facilitated
state (Figure 4A). However, a 12˚ instantaneous jump elicits a similar (slower) response time course
to the unfacilitated probe (grey line), confirming the limited extent to which facilitation initially
extends ahead of the target path. A large 20˚ jump ahead (Figure 4A) bypassing the focus-region
entirely, again reveals surround suppression, with a much slower response time course than the con-
trol. Instantaneous backwards jumps (Figure 4B) also reveal potent suppression.
Pauses without a jump (0˚), show that facilitation strength slowly decays over time at the last seen
location of the target (Figure 4C,E, Cohen’s d = 4.48). With no pause (0 ms), the strongest
responses occur 4˚ in front of the moving target (Figure 4E) as observed in the 2D receptive fields
(Figure 3A). Given that the target moves at 40˚/s, it would have traversed 4˚, 12˚ and 20˚ during
pause ‘occlusions’ of 100 ms, 300 ms and 500 ms respectively. When larger jumps are matched to
their respective pauses as might be expected during trajectory occlusions (12˚ and 300 ms; 20˚ and
500 ms) there is a statistically significant increase in the resultant spiking activity (Figure 4E, Cohen’s
d = 2.0 and 2.32 respectively).
Primers increase contrast sensitivity
The data presented so far make a strong case for a complex predictive mechanism working to boost
responses in a region where a target seen in the recent past is likely to move to in the near future. In
primates, one known effect of such attentional or expectation effects is an upregulation of local con-
trast sensitivity (gain control) (Reynolds et al., 2000; Carrasco et al., 2000). To quantify changes in
gain, we measured responses to varying contrast probes, preceded by either a low or high contrast
primer (Figure 5A,B, Video 3). Both primers induced a large increase in response, with a larger out-
put range (increased maximum response) and a greater than 5-fold increase in contrast sensitivity
(Figure 5C, contrast threshold reduced from 0.071 to 0.013 for near threshold stimuli, C50 from 0.36
to 0.13, n = 9 dragonflies). Lower contrast primers themselves induce less overall activity during the
priming stimulus (Figure 5D, Cohen’s d = 0.97), yet their effect on subsequent responses to stimuli
presented at the expected location is remarkably similar to high contrast primers (cf. pink with red
lines in Figure 5C). This suggests that the gain modulation is not elicited solely by the stimulus
Video 2. Visual stimulus for Figure 3. The unfacilitated
receptive field is mapped by a 10 � 10 grid of probes
moving on short paths (Figure 3A, contour lines, only
five trials shown in this video). A primer drifts on a long
trajectory towards the center of the screen, before
repeating presentation of each probe. Identical trials
are replicated with a 300 ms pause separating the
primer and probe (Figure 3B). All trials were presented
in a randomised order, separated by rest periods of at
least 7 s.

 contrast or the neuronal activity induced by the primer per se, but rather by target presence. This
may indicate a ‘switch’ process, such as that suggested for neural circuits in the auditory brain stem
of the barn owl (Mysore et al., 2011), rather than a simpler, activity-dependent gain control mecha-
nism. Another interesting feature of the facilitated contrast sensitivity is that the boost of response
gain is largest at mid-contrast, with softer saturation at high contrasts, extending the range of con-
trasts over which the response is modulated by a full order of magnitude. Both observations make
sense considering the natural context for target detection. During pursuit flights, resources could
thus be directed to the expected target location independent of its varying contrast as it moves
across a cluttered background. Moreover, the reduction in slope of the contrast sensitivity function
would reduce overall response variance to changes in the contrast of the selected target, a phenom-
enon also observed in humans (Avidan et al., 2002).
Our results also show that the increased contrast sensitivity is localized to the focus-region evi-
dent in Figure 3. A more distant primer displaced 20˚ to the side of the probe does not evoke facili-
tation of the contrast sensitivity function (Figure 5C). Instead, the contrast sensitivity function reveals

contrast experiments used a shorter primer duration (600 ms vs. 1 s), suggesting that suppression
could result in part from CSTMD1’s global activity, rather than presynaptic processing. Facilitating

Figure 4. Spatial jumps and temporal pauses in target trajectories. (A) CSTMD1’s normalized response to a short
probe trajectory builds over several hundred milliseconds (grey line) and is changed by the position and timing of
a 500 ms priming target. Probes jumped forward immediately following the primer, reveal kfacilitated responses
(4˚ ahead), unfacilitated responses (12˚ ahead) and suppression (20˚ ahead), indicative of the focus-region in
Figure 3. (B) A jump immediately back over the primer path exhibits unfacilitated (4˚ behind) or strongly inhibited
(12˚ or 20˚ behind) responses. (C) Inserting a temporal pause between primer and probe shows that weaker
facilitation persists at the primed location for over 500 ms, diminishing as the pause duration increases. (D)
Combining a short pause with a jump reveals a forward spread of facilitation that could account for an occlusion.
(A-D, n = 9 technical replicates from one dragonfly) (E) At the target’s last seen position (jump size 0˚), probe
responses decrease at times following the primer’s disappearance (p=0.0005). In comparison, responses to probes
jumped 12˚ and 20˚ ahead increase when matched to their corresponding occlusion durations of 300 ms (p=0.008)
and 500 ms (p=0.008). Asterisks indicate significance, n = 8 dragonflies.

 stimuli certainly increase the firing rate against a steadily hyperpolarizing membrane potential
(Figure 5D). Following a high contrast primer, this hyperpolarizing motion-after-effect (MAE) reaches
almost 4 mV and suppresses subsequent spiking activity for several hundred milliseconds
(Figure 5D,E), an attenuation that may compete with spatially-localized facilitation. Interaction
between the facilitation time course and longer-term suppression with slow kinetics may be analo-
gous to the ‘inhibition of return’ observed in human reaction time experiments (Posner and Cohen,
1984).

is presented before varying contrast probes (contrast sensitivity function). These either continue the path trajectory
or jump to a distant location. (B) Example data traces of responses to either low (grey) or high (black) contrast
primers that are presented before a series of varying contrast probes (light, medium and dark blue) (C) CSTMD1’s
sensitivity to varying contrast probes exhibits a sigmoidal function (grey), with the dashed line indicating a
detection threshold above spontaneous levels. Following either a nearby low contrast (pink) or high contrast (red)
primer, contrast sensitivity is substantially increased (n = 9 dragonflies, p<0.0001). A distant primer (yellow) does
not elicit facilitation, even though spiking activity during low and high contrast primers (final 100 ms) is significantly
different (inset, n = 9 dragonflies, p=0.02). (D) In response to an excitatory stimulus (e.g. high contrast stimulation),
the underlying membrane potential is hyperpolarized, a form of motion-after-effect (MAE). (E) The hyperpolarizing
motion-after-effect is related to the strength (e.g. target contrast) of the stimulus.

 Primers induce directionality
The facilitated response of CSTMD1 appears to
be only weakly direction-selective when stimu-
lated with targets moving along prolonged paths.
Within each hemifield, CSTMD1 has a weak pref-
erence for progressive motion upwards and away
from the midline (rightwards for the neurons
recorded here) (Nordstro
¨m et al., 2011). To test
whether the focus also anticipates the direction
of a moving target, we presented a primer mov-
ing along one of four cardinal directions, fol-
lowed by a probe that moves in eight possible
directions
(Figure
6A,B,
Video
4).
Probe
responses alone are both weak and weakly direc-
tion selective (Figure 6C, grey dots). But all four
primers facilitate
responses maximally in the
direction of the primer’s path, shifting the direc-
tion
tuning
to
match
that
of
the
primer
(Figure 6C). The b1/b0 ratio is a measure of the
strength of directionality which is similar for each
of the conditions (Figure 6D). However, the mag-
nitude of facilitation (Figure 6E) is considerably
larger in CSTMD1’s weak preferred, direction
(upwards and rightwards for this hemisphere’s
CSTMD1). Such targets would be those moving away from the dragonfly’s own heading
(Olberg, 1986) with the mirror-symmetric CSTMD1 expected to exhibit directional preference to
progressive targets moving upwards and to the left. This suggests that the preference of both the
underlying tuning and the recruitment of facilitation may be linked to a control role in downstream
processing of target trajectories for pursuit. Following a reversal of the target trajectory (Figure 6F,
blue and purple lines), CSTMD1’s response is strongly inhibited compared to the corresponding
probe alone response (grey lines). This contrasts with findings in the vertebrate retina, where a sub-
set of ganglion cells respond strongly and synchronously to motion reversals (Schwartz et al.,
2007).
Does the recruitment of enhanced responses in the direction of travel represent an alteration of
the direction selectivity in underlying local motion detectors, or does it result from the offset posi-
tion of the focus of gain modulation located just ahead of the most recent target location
(Figure 3A)? We tested this by jumping the probe stimulus 4˚ forward into the predicted center of
the focus region (Figure 7A, Video 5). This stimulus induced much weaker direction selectivity
(Figure 7B) than those that radiate away from the end of the same priming path (b1/b0 ratio of 0.32
vs. 0.50, p=0.04). Probes that reverse direction relative to the primer are not facilitated, except
when the probe jumps 4˚ into the focus center (Figure 7C, Cohen’s d = 3.90). Thus, the predictive
focus of gain modulation is a spatial phenomenon, established by the past trajectory. This suggests
that the apparent direction selectivity induced by primers is not due to any change in the local bias
of underlying motion detectors to any one stimulus direction, but rather from the overall displace-
ment of the focus ahead of the target location. Over a target’s developing trajectory, direction
selectivity (quantified here as vector magnitude) is established even more rapidly than the gain in
the facilitated response (Figure 7D). The emergence of directional tuning raises the intriguing possi-
bility that the modulation assists anticipation of target trajectories - promoting the expectation of a
continued path. How such tuning matches closed-loop pursuits of the hawking dragonfly with its
prey or conspecifics is not yet known.
Facilitation in earlier retinotopic neurons
CSTMD1 is a higher-order neuron with inputs in the anterior optic tubercle, a midbrain output desti-
nation of optic lobe interneurons. We also tested for the facilitatory component of the predictive
gain modulation in likely pre-cursor neurons: small-field (SF) STMDs located at an earlier stage of

primer that drifts at the same horizontal path as the

horizontal path - High Contrast Primed (distant).
Primed trials are also repeated with lower contrast
primers (Low Contrast Primed). All trials were
presented in a randomised order, separated by rest
periods of at least 7 s.

 visual processing (Barnett et al., 2007). Retinotopically organized SF-STMDs have inputs in the
outer lobula, a region akin to mammalian primary visual cortex (Okamura and Strausfeld, 2007;
O’Carroll 1993). They have properties similar to end-stopped (hypercomplex) cells (Nordstro
¨m and
O’Carroll, 2009), which are modulated by contextual stimuli presented outside their classical recep-
tive field (Polat et al., 1998). We presented primers outside SF-STMD receptive fields, that them-
selves induce no activity above spontaneous levels (Figure 8A,B, Video 6, n = 13 dragonflies), with
probe stimuli that are limited to the classical (excitatory) receptive field. Primers moving toward the
receptive field facilitate the probe responses by over 40%, whilst those heading away elicit no facili-
tation. This predictive gain modulation may be inherited and improved downstream, since we also
observe facilitation in other large-field STMD neurons, with an average gain of over 80% (Figure 8C,
Cohen’s d = 1.02). Individual responses of both small and large field STMDs vary in facilitation
strength, as well as overall activity. The retinotopic organization (Figure 8D) and facilitation

 observed in SF-STMD’s make them ideal candi-
dates for mediating an interhemispheric transfer
of localized predictive gain modulation. Support-
ing this hypothesis, at least one identified (dye-
filled) SF-STMD axon traverses the brain with an
output arborization located within a limited area
of the contralateral lobula (Figure 8D). Neurons

Discussion
Neuronal receptive fields are defined by their
excitatory and inhibitory responses to stimula-
tion. Populations of such responses elucidate net-
work function, for example, as control systems in
insect flight behavior (Gonzalez-Bellido et al.,
2013; Maisak et al., 2013). However, our results
show that in addition to stimulus selectivity (con-
trast, size, velocity), a neuron’s receptive field is
also a dynamic representation of the spatial (Wiederman and O’Carroll, 2013) and temporal con-
text. Here modulation of the dynamic receptive field represents anticipatory coding, a more complex
influence of history than simple neuronal adaptation, sensitization, habituation or fatigue. Indeed,
such complexity in processing is also evident in the ‘omitted stimulus response’ in the vertebrate

 retina, where an omitted component of a peri-
odic pattern predictively elicits robust neuronal
activity (Schwartz et al., 2007). These examples
highlight that the brain is a ‘predictive machine’
(Rao
&
Ballard
1999).
However,
instead
of
encoding novelty or the unexpected, STMD neu-
rons predict consistency of a selected target’s
trajectory, all whilst suppressing distracters.
Direction selectivity is, in effect, a simple form
of prediction. For example, the Hassenstein-
Reichardt correlator provides a nonlinear, facili-
tated response when an adjacent point is stimu-
lated within a future period (Hassenstein and
Reichardt, 1956). However, such direction selec-
tive models cannot explain the observation of a
traveling gain modulation that spreads further
forward, the longer the occlusion. Neither can
these models account for changes in preferred
direction, determined by the target’s previous
direction of travel. Such models do not result in a
contrast invariant ‘switch’ establishing the focus
strength, nor the presence of a large suppressive surround. Furthermore, the effects described here
are on larger scales either spatially (tens of degrees) or temporally (hundreds of milliseconds) com-
pared with local motion detection processes, such as optic flow analysis (tens of milliseconds,
Guo and Reichardt, 1987). Finally, our results show a local, predictive focus of facilitation that tra-
verses across brain hemispheres, which is an attribute more reminiscent of higher order attentional
networks, rather than local motion encoding circuitry.
Our findings of over a 400% increase in contrast sensitivity is consistent with studies that cue spa-
tial attention in vertebrates, albeit with a significantly larger increase. For example, the contrast gain
of human observers is increased by approximately 40% for stimuli presented at an attended location
(Carrasco et al., 2000), with concurrent decreased contrast gain for stimuli presented elsewhere
(Pestilli and Carrasco, 2005). Similar results are also observed in single unit recordings from
macaque V4, where gratings presented at attended locations elicit responses equivalent to a 51%
increase in stimulus contrast (Reynolds et al., 2000). Whilst there is ongoing debate over whether
attention modulates contrast gain (Reynolds et al., 2000) or response gain (Lee and Maunsell,
2010), the facilitation in CSTMD1 reveals a combination of both (Figure 5C). CSTMD1’s gain modu-
lation could be an inherent component of the prediction mechanism, or the result of the priming tar-
get acting as a cue directing attention to the targets predicted location.
We have previously reported that CSTMD1 selectively attends to one target when presented with
a pair of competing stimuli, completely ignoring the distracter (Wiederman and O’Carroll, 2013). In
repeated trials, the selected target was not always the same and even occasionally switched mid-
trial. This raises the intriguing possibility that the predictive focus ‘locks on’ to a single target, sup-
pressing distracters. The anticipatory gain control measured here provides a possible explanation for
this behavior – a positive feedback that allows the neuron to lock onto a single object while other
mechanisms, including global inhibition, may help suppress competing objects. Future experiments
will address the parameters of the stimuli (e.g. timing, salience) that permit the predictive focus to
switch between alternative targets. Furthermore, we are currently investigating whether the predic-
tive focus and competitive selection is elicited bottom-up by the stimuli (exogenous) or includes a
top-down component (endogenous). That is, for a dragonfly feeding in a swarm, are target saliency
attributes driving pursuit selection, or is the dragonfly choosing its prey from more complex internal
workings?
For decades, scientists studied the neuronal basis of ‘elementary motion detection’ in true flies
(Diptera). With morphological (Takemura et al., 2013) and physiological (Maisak et al., 2013)
experiments making significant progress at elucidating this circuitry, increasing attention is now shift-
ing towards other visual tasks such as feature discrimination (Aptekar et al., 2015; Keles
¸ and Frye,
2017). Until now, there has been a divide between such ‘simple’ visual operations and higher-order

toward (red) or away (yellow) from the classical receptive field (RF), preceding a probe target within the RF (mean,
n = 13 dragonflies). (B) Outside the receptive field, primer responses do not significantly differ from spontaneous
activity. Primers that move towards the receptive field increase probe responses by over 40% (p=0.0004, n = 13
dragonflies). (C) Individual STMDs, with either small or large receptive fields, exhibit varying degrees of facilitation
(blue). Mean facilitation (black) increase responses by over 40% in small-field (n = 13 dragonflies), 80% in large-

 were inserted through the neural sheath into the proximal lobula complex using a piezo-electric
stepper (Marzhauser-Wetzlar PM-10), with typical resistance between 50–150 MW. Intracellular
responses were digitized at 5 kHz with a 16-bit A/D converter (National Instruments) for off-line anal-
ysis with MATLAB.
Freshly penetrated cells were presented with small targets, bars and wide-field gratings for classi-
fication. Neurons were classed as STMDs when responding robustly to visual stimuli composed of
small, moving targets and not responsive to bars or gratings. CSTMD1 was identified by its charac-
teristic receptive field, response tuning and action potentials. STMD neurons were categorized into
small or large-field by mapping their receptive fields with drifting targets (a half-width either less
than, or greater than 25˚).
Visual stimuli and data analysis
We presented stimuli on high definition LCD monitors (120 Hz and above). The animal was placed
20 cm away and centered on the visual midline. Contrast stimuli were presented at screen center to
minimize off-axis artefacts. Stimulus scripts (https://github.com/swiederm/predictive-gain) were writ-
ten
using
MATLAB’s
Psychtoolbox
and
integrated
into
the
data
acquisition
system (Wiederman et al., 2017; a copy is archived at https://github.com/elifesciences-publica-
tions/predictive-gain). Unless stated otherwise all targets were 1.5˚x1.5˚ black squares drifted at 40˚/
s. A minimum of 7 s rest between trials was implemented to avoid habituation or facilitation from
prior trials. Data were only ever excluded due to pathological damage of the neuron or extensive
habituation (experiment cessation). All means are calculated from biological replicates (i.e. repeated
measurements from identified neurons in different animals). Each biological replicate represents the
mean of between 1 and 10 technical replicates.
Statistical tests
We report exact P (unless miniscule). Due to the small sample sizes, all tests are nonparametric, two-
sided and account for multiple comparisons. All box and whisker plots indicate median, interquartile
and full minimum-maximum range (whiskers).
Predictive focus of gain modulation: We mapped the spatial extent of this focus with a series of
200 ms probe targets randomly presented across a 10 � 10 grid of locations within CSTMD1’s excit-
atory receptive field. We calculated spike rate within an analysis window (50–150 ms) following
probe onset at each location. We randomly interleaved unprimed probe stimuli with (in 50% of trials)
corresponding probes that followed a 1 second-long primer target (n = 9 dragonflies). Priming tar-
gets moved vertically up the screen at 32˚/s, pseudo-randomly presented within a 5˚ wide region
(white outlined box) to minimize local habituation induced by the primer. For each spatial location
(100 in total), we calculated the difference between probe response (following primer) with probe
response (no primer). Inter-trial and inter-neuronal noise in the focus colormaps was reduced by
averaging across dragonflies interpolated and slightly smoothed (Gaussian, s = 0.5) matrices. This
noise-reducing method effectively portrays the result of adding the primer target, however, may
slightly blur the focus region due to averaging across samples. A second experiment followed the
same protocol except with a 300 ms pause inserted between primer and probe (n = 7 dragonflies).
A third experiment had the primer moving horizontally within the visual field of the contralateral eye
with care taken to avoid the frontal region of 10˚ binocular overlap. This experiment also included a
300 ms pause inserted between primer and probe (n = 7 dragonflies). To examine the significance of
these maps, we created Cohen’s d versions. For each spatial location (loc), we calculated the mean
difference (primer & probe – probe alone) across the sample size (n, number of dragonflies) and
divided by the standard deviation of these differences across the sample size. This effect size repre-
sents the mean observed change at each location (across dragonflies) normalized by the standard
deviation at each location (across dragonflies). Note that to avoid divide by zero errors, we did not
calculate the Cohen’s d values for the inhibitory hemifield (map for Figure 3C) which has no activity,
and thus minimal standard deviation. For specific locations of interest, we tested for statistical signif-
icance by calculating the paired t-statistic and two-tailed P-value.

Further experiments were conducted along a 1-dimensional path. Firstly, with a constrained loca-

onflies). For the time courses, we normalized responses by dividing by fully-facilitated controls
(corresponding spatial locations), thus accounting for spatial inhomogeneity in the receptive field.
Statistical comparisons applied either Wilcoxon or Friedman’s tests with multiple comparisons.
Contrast sensitivity
We varied the contrast (7 values) of a probe target drifted upwards through CSTMD1’s receptive
field (n = 9). Target contrast (Weber) was defined as:
cw ¼ Itarget � Ibackground
Ibackground
Probes drifted upwards for 600 ms at two possible locations separated horizontally by 20˚. For
each probe contrast, we measured responses in an analysis window (50–150 ms) following onset. Pri-
mers drifted upwards for 600 ms, either towards the probe location (primer) or displaced 20˚ to the
side (distant primer). Primer contrast was either 1.0 (high contrast) or 0.2 (low contrast). Primer
responses were quantified over the last 100 ms of primer motion. We inserted a 50 ms pause
between primer and probe and primer to ensure that the residual primer response was not attrib-
uted to the probe. Trial order across all contrast sensitivity experiments was randomized. The param-
eters (top, bottom, logIC50 and hill-slope) of each contrast sensitivity function were compared with
an extra sum-of-squares F test, whilst responses to primers were compared by Wilcoxon test. To
define a detectability threshold for estimating contrast sensitivity, we measured spontaneous activity
in the 1 s pre-stimulus period across all 630 trials (n = 9 dragonflies). For each neuron, responses
were binned (20 ms) before calculating the upper 95th percentile of binned responses.
Direction selectivity
We measured CSTMD1’s direction selectivity by drifting probes in 8 directions from a central point
in CSTMD1’s excitatory receptive field (n = 9). Primers drifted for 1 s in each of 4 cardinal directions
terminating at the probe location. In a separate experiment, vertically drifted primers terminated 4˚
below the probe location, placing all probes within the center of focus (n = 5). Probe responses
were analyzed in a window (40–100 ms) following probe onset. This window is shorter and earlier
than in other experiments to account for the rapid establishment of probe direction selectivity.
We quantify direction selectivity in two ways. We regress responses onto the sinusoidal model R
(�)=b0 +b1 sin(� + j), where R is the response at direction �, b0 is the offset, b1 is the directional
component of the response and j is the phase (preferred direction). We also quantify the mean
polar vector for each condition, calculating 95% confidence intervals for both vector direction and
vector magnitude across all cells.
Differences in b1/b0 ratio between trials that were primed upward, and upward following a for-
ward jump were compared with a Mann-Whitney test. The variance of responses to targets that turn
back in the opposite direction to the primer were analyzed by a Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by
Dunn’s multiple comparisons. We applied the Kruskal-Wallis test because the direction tuning data
with (Figure 7C, condition J) and without (Figure 7C, conditions P U R L D) a forward jump was
obtained from different independent samples.

 SF-STMD facilitation
Responses were elicited by 400 ms probe trajectories, commencing motion within the classical
receptive field and drifted in the neuron’s preferred direction. Primers were either drifted for 800 ms
‘towards’ the excitatory receptive field, or from within the excitatory receptive field moving ‘away’.
Primers terminated at least 8˚ away from the classical receptive field, and were followed by a 200 ms
pause before the appearance of the probe stimulus. Primer responses were analyzed in a window
300–800 ms following onset, whilst the probe was 50–150 ms following probe onset.
The remaining large-field and small-field experiments were performed across populations of neu-
rons with varying overall activity. To normalize, neuronal responses for a given neuron were divided
by a factor equal to the neuron’s mean response to probes across all priming conditions. To convert
responses back into spikes/s, we multiplied the normalized response by the mean factor for all neu-
rons in the dataset. As all conditions were paired across independent samples, we compare
responses across conditions by a Friedman test, followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons. All statis-
tical tests presented are two-tailed.
Dye filling
The morphology of an SF-STMD neuron was visualized by intracellular labelling with Lucifer Yellow.
Iontophoresis was achieved by passing 3nA negative current through electrodes tip-filled with 4%
Lucifer Yellow solution in 0.1M LiCl. Brains were then carefully dissected, fixed overnight in 4% para-
formaldehyde at 4˚C, dehydrated in ethanol series (70%, 90%, 100%, 100%), cleared in methyl salicy-
late and mounted on a cavity slide for fluorescence imaging.
