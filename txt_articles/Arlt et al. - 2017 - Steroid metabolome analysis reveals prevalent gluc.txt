BACKGROUND. Adrenal aldosterone excess is the most common cause of secondary hypertension 
and is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity. However, adverse metabolic risk in 
primary aldosteronism extends beyond hypertension, with increased rates of insulin resistance, 
type 2 diabetes, and osteoporosis, which cannot be easily explained by aldosterone excess.
METHODS. We performed mass spectrometry–based analysis of a 24-hour urine steroid 
metabolome in 174 newly diagnosed patients with primary aldosteronism (103 unilateral adenomas, 
71 bilateral adrenal hyperplasias) in comparison to 162 healthy controls, 56 patients with endocrine 
inactive adrenal adenoma, 104 patients with mild subclinical, and 47 with clinically overt adrenal 
cortisol excess. We also analyzed the expression of cortisol-producing CYP11B1 and aldosterone-
producing CYP11B2 enzymes in adenoma tissue from 57 patients with aldosterone-producing 
adenoma, employing immunohistochemistry with digital image analysis.
RESULTS. Primary aldosteronism patients had significantly increased cortisol and total 
glucocorticoid metabolite excretion (all P < 0.001), only exceeded by glucocorticoid output in patients 
with clinically overt adrenal Cushing syndrome. Several surrogate parameters of metabolic risk 
correlated significantly with glucocorticoid but not mineralocorticoid output. Intratumoral CYP11B1 
expression was significantly associated with the corresponding in vivo glucocorticoid excretion. 
Unilateral adrenalectomy resolved both mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid excess. Postoperative 
evidence of adrenal insufficiency was found in 13 (29%) of 45 consecutively tested patients.
CONCLUSION. Our data indicate that glucocorticoid cosecretion is frequently found in primary 
aldosteronism and contributes to associated metabolic risk. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist 
therapy alone may not be sufficient to counteract adverse metabolic risk in medically treated 
patients with primary aldosteronism.

Introduction
Primary aldosteronism is the most common form of secondary hypertension, affecting 3%–5% of the gen-
eral hypertensive population and 8%–10% of patients referred to specialist hypertension services (1–4). 
The main causes of primary aldosteronism are bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and unilateral aldosterone-
producing adrenal adenoma (1), whereas inherited forms of primary aldosteronism, such as familial hyper-
aldosteronism type 1 and 3, account for less than 1% of cases. In the majority of aldosterone-producing 
adenomas, somatic driver mutations in the KCNJ5, ATP1A1, ATP2B3, CACNA1D, and CTNNB1 genes have 
been identified (5–9). Differentiating unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma from bilateral adrenal 
hyperplasia as the cause of primary aldosteronism provides the basis for therapeutic stratification. Adeno-
mas are generally surgically removed, while patients with bilateral hyperplasia receive long-term treatment 
with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.
Hypertension is a strong predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (10). Patients with prima-
ry aldosteronism have an even higher cardiovascular risk than patients with essential hypertension (11–15). 
However, in addition, a number of reports have described an increased prevalence of insulin resistance, 
type 2 diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, as well as clinically relevant depression and anxiety in patients with 
primary aldosteronism (16–23). These conditions would be more logically attributable to glucocorticoid 
rather than mineralocorticoid excess. Current diagnostic work-up in primary aldosteronism, however, does 
not include assessment for hypercortisolism (1).
Here, we employed mass spectrometry to explore the steroid metabolome in a large cohort of primary 
aldosteronism patients who underwent detailed metabolic phenotyping, in addition to subtype specifica-
tion and genotyping. We compared the results of 24-hour urine steroid metabolite excretion, reflective of 
net steroid production, to those in healthy controls and patients with adrenal adenomas including subclini-
cal and overt adrenal Cushing’s syndrome.
Results
Demographics and clinical metabolic phenotype. We evaluated an exploratory cohort of 220 consecutively 
recruited patients with primary aldosteronism: an exploratory cohort comprising 103 patients with uni-
lateral aldosterone-producing adenoma, 71 patients with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, and a confirmatory 
cohort of 46 patients with unilateral adenoma. For comparison, we included 162 healthy control subjects 
and 3 additional patient groups: 56 patients with endocrine-inactive adrenal adenoma; 104 patients with 
subclinical, mild adrenal cortisol excess; and 47 patients with clinically overt adrenal Cushing syndrome. 
The clinical characteristics of all study subjects are summarized in Table 1. Following the analysis of the 
exploratory cohort results, we prospectively recruited a confirmatory cohort of 46 patients with primary 
aldosteronism; Figure 1 provides a flowchart showing the patient and comparator groups and the diagnos-
tic assessments they underwent.
Steroid metabolome analysis in primary aldosteronism. A heatmap visualization sorted in the order of 
increasing excretion of the major aldosterone metabolite tetrahydroaldosterone (Figure 2A) demonstrated, 
as expected, a clustering of the primary aldosteronism cases to the right of the heatmap, consistent with 
increased aldosterone production. Surprisingly, an equivalent heatmap visualizing glucocorticoid output, 
sorted in the order of increasing cortisol excretion, also demonstrated a clear clustering of primary aldoste-
ronism patients among those with the highest glucocorticoid output (Figure 2B).
As expected, 24-hour tetrahydroaldosterone excretion was significantly increased in primary aldoste-
ronism patients (healthy controls, median 30 [interquartile range 22–44] μg/24 h; primary aldosteronism, 
99 [interquartile range 60–159] μg/24 h; P < 0.001) (Supplemental Information [SI] Appendix and Supple-
mental Figure 1A; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.
insight.93136DS1). However, quantitative comparison of steroid excretion between primary aldosteronism 
patients and healthy controls also revealed 24-hour total glucocorticoid output as significantly increased in 
primary aldosteronism (11,306 [interquartile range 7,999–14,907] μg/24 h vs. 8,262 [6,337–11,070] μg/24 
h in healthy controls; P < 0.001), with similar findings for cortisol excretion (SI Appendix and Supplemen-
tal Figure 1, B and C).
Both primary aldosteronism subtypes, unilateral aldosterone-producing adrenal adenoma and bilateral 
adrenal hyperplasia, had significantly higher glucocorticoid output than controls, with no significant dif-
ference between the 2 disease groups (SI Appendix and Supplemental Figure 2). Similarly, comparison of 
glucocorticoid excretion in patients with adenomas harboring somatic KCNJ5 mutations (n = 31) did not

differ from those with non-KCNJ5 mutations (n = 23) and wild type (n = 34), with significantly increased 
glucocorticoid excretion in all 3 (data not shown).
Glucocorticoid output in primary aldosteronism and adverse metabolic risk phenotype. Correlation analyses 
adjusted for sex and age revealed 24-hour total glucocorticoid output as significantly correlated with body 
mass index and markers of insulin resistance (fasting insulin, insulin after oral glucose challenge; homeo-
stasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]) in both control subjects and primary aldoste-
ronism (all P < 0.01). However, in primary aldosteronism patients, total glucocorticoid output also signifi-
cantly correlated with additional parameters of adverse metabolic risk (waist circumference [P < 0.001], 
high-density lipoprotein [P < 0.001], and diastolic blood pressure [P < 0.01]; Supplemental Table 1). By 
contrast, tetrahydroaldosterone excretion only correlated with systolic blood pressure, albeit above our 
stringent level of significance (P ≤ 0.01), with a P value of 0.02 (Supplemental Table 1).
Steroid output in primary aldosteronism in comparison to Cushing’s patients. To put the extent of glucocor-
ticoid excess into context, we compared glucocorticoid output in the primary aldosteronism patients to 
that in patients with adrenocortical adenomas that were either endocrine inactive or fulfilled the diagnos-
tic criteria for subclinical and clinically overt Cushing’s syndrome (Figure 3, SI Appendix, and Supple-
mental Table 2). This revealed significantly increased cortisol output in primary aldosteronism that was 
at least as high as in patients with subclinical Cushing’s syndrome, a group with documented adverse 
cardiovascular and metabolic consequences due to mild cortisol excess (24–26). Furthermore, total glu-
cocorticoid excretion was significantly higher in primary aldosteronism (median 11,306 [interquartile 
range 7,999–14,907] μg/24 h) than in controls (8,262 [6,337–11,070] μg/24 h), while subclinical Cush-
ing’s patients did not significantly differ from controls (SI Appendix and Supplemental Table 2). The per-
centage difference in total glucocorticoid excretion relative to healthy controls was 25.0% (95% CI 14.4, 
35.6) in primary aldosteronism and only 3.4% (95% CI –21.4, 28.1) in patients with subclinical Cushing’s 
syndrome (SI Appendix and Supplemental Table 3).
A detailed pathway analysis of the steroid metabolome in the 4 different disease groups revealed 
distinct differences (SI Appendix and Supplemental Figure 3). The primary aldosteronism group showed 
significantly increased excretion of all metabolites of the mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid synthesis 
pathways. Their androgen production largely resembled those in controls but showed an increased excre-
tion of the major adrenal androgen metabolite 11β-hydroxyandrosterone (SI Appendix and Supplemental

Figure 3A). This was found in primary aldosteronism, but none of the other groups (Figure 3D). By 
contrast, the overt Cushing’s group (SI Appendix and Supplemental Figure 3B) showed decreased andro-
gen output in the presence of increased glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid precursor metabolites. The 
subclinical Cushing’s groups (SI Appendix and Supplemental Figure 3, C and D) showed a similar pattern 
to overt Cushing’s, albeit attenuated with only 2 of 9 glucocorticoid metabolites significantly increased.

Patients with primary aldosteronism and overt Cushing’s patients showed significant increases in all 9 
glucocorticoid metabolites (SI Appendix and Supplemental Figure 3, A and B).
Steroid output in primary aldosteronism due to unilateral adenoma before and after adrenalectomy. Comparing 
preoperative to postoperative steroid excretion in a cohort of 46 patients with primary aldosteronism due 
to unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma, we found that following surgical removal of the adeno-
ma, not only tetrahydroaldosterone but also total glucocorticoid output significantly decreased (Figure 
4, A–C). Similarly, excretion of 11β-hydroxyandrosterone, the metabolite of the major adrenal androgen 
precursor 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione, significantly decreased after surgery (Figure 4D, SI Appendix, 
and Supplemental Table 4). Heatmap visualization comparing pre- and postoperative urine steroid metab-
olomes revealed patient clusters with increased mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid production prior to 
surgery (SI Appendix and Supplemental Figure 4, A and B), but also demonstrated distinct, albeit smaller 
clusters of patients with preoperatively increased 11β-hydroxyandrosterone (SI Appendix and Supple-
mental Figure 4C). This suggested that the source of glucocorticoid and adrenal androgen excess in these 
patients was indeed the surgically removed adrenocortical adenoma.
Intratumoral steroidogenic enzyme expression and correlation with in vivo steroid output. We next carried out 
immunohistochemistry of a tissue microarray composed of surgical material from 57 of our aldosterone-
producing adrenal adenoma patients and quantified intratumoral steroidogenic enzyme expression by digital 
image analysis. We analyzed the expression of CYP11B1, which is required for the synthesis of cortisol and 
11β-hydroxyandrostenedione, and CYP11B2, which catalyzes aldosterone synthesis. Results showed that

CYP11B1 immunostaining was associated with the excretion of glucocorticoids (P < 0.05) and the major 
11β-hydroxyandrostenedione metabolite 11β-hydroxyandrosterone (P < 0.01), but not with tetrahydroaldo-
sterone. Vice versa, CYP11B2 was associated with tetrahydroaldosterone (P < 0.05), but not with glucocor-
ticoid or 11β-hydroxyandrosterone excretion (Table 2). Of note, tumor morphology consistently differed 
when comparing adenoma tissues in relation to glucocorticoid output, with a zona fasciculate–type pattern 
in tissues from patients with the lowest glucocorticoid excretion, and a pattern resembling zona glomerulosa 
architecture in tissue from patients with the highest glucocorticoid excretion (examples shown in Figure 5).
Glucocorticoid excess in primary aldosteronism and postoperative cortisol reserve. After the analysis of our 
results suggested that glucocorticoid excess represents a prevalent and highly relevant feature in primary 
aldosteronism, we prospectively assessed the pre- and postoperative adrenal function in a confirmatory 
cohort of 46 consecutively recruited patients with unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma. Interestingly, 
despite significantly increased urinary glucocorticoid output, very few patients showed results indicative 
of glucocorticoid excess, using either an overnight dexamethasone suppression test or late-night salivary 
cortisol. However, preoperatively, plasma corticotropin (andrenocorticotropic hormone, ACTH) was low 
normal, with a median of 14 [interquartile range 9–19] pg/ml, which increased significantly (P = 0.0012) to 
22 [interquartile range 16–39] pg/ml 2 weeks postoperatively (reference range 4–50 pg/ml).
Clinically relevant glucocorticoid excess due to an adrenal tumor is typically associated with post-
operative suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and hence suppression of function 
of the contralateral adrenal gland. This results in the need for hydrocortisone replacement in patients 
with subclinical and overt adrenal Cushing’s syndrome after curative adrenalectomy (27). Therefore,

46 consecutively recruited patients underwent a cosyntropin stimulation test to assess cortisol reserve 
10–14 days after removal of the aldosterone-producing adrenocortical adenoma. Consistent with the 
evidence of glucocorticoid excess in the steroid metabolome analysis, 13 of 45 (29%) patients failed 
to appropriately respond to cosyntropin stimulation (serum cortisol 30 minutes after 250 μg ACTH1–24 
< 15.6 μg/dl [<430 nmol/l]), with both baseline and stimulated serum cortisol significantly lower in 
primary aldosteronism than in 82 healthy controls (P < 0.01) (Figure 4, E and F).
Discussion
A number of previous case reports or small case series (28–35) have reported excess glucocorticoid secretion 
in primary aldosteronism patients, a phenomenon thought to represent a rarity. However, the current study 
provides evidence for the concomitant presence of glucocorticoid excess in a large proportion of patients 
with primary aldosteronism, an observation we found to be independent of primary aldosteronism subtype 
or tumor tissue genotypes. Of note, we found that glucocorticoid output in primary aldosteronism was at 
least similar to that in subclinical Cushing’s syndrome, a cohort widely reported to suffer from increased 
cardiovascular risk (24–26). Intriguingly, we found that glucocorticoid excess significantly correlated with 
several parameters indicative of adverse metabolic risk in primary aldosteronism, including waist circumfer-
ence, high-density lipoprotein, and diastolic blood pressure, in addition to body mass index and insulin resis-
tance that were influenced by obesity in both controls and primary aldosteronism patients. By contrast, there 
was no significant association of mineralocorticoid output with metabolic risk parameters. This suggests 
that the previously unrecognized glucocorticoid excess in primary aldosteronism is a major determinant of 
metabolic risk. This potentially novel biochemical characteristic of primary aldosteronism could provide an 
explanation for comorbidities that are observed but difficult to explain in the context of hyperaldosteronism, 
such as insulin resistance (16–20), osteoporotic fractures (21, 36), and depression (22, 23). Patients with pri-
mary aldosteronism who do not undergo surgery currently receive medical treatment with mineralocorticoid 
receptor antagonists. Our findings indicate that it should be investigated whether such patients might need 
additional, glucocorticoid-opposing treatment to mitigate persistent cardiovascular risk. That this is clinical-
ly highly relevant is further supported by a recent cohort study in 2,533 patients with primary aldosteronism, 
which found a particularly increased osteoporotic fracture risk in women with primary aldosteronism who 
were not treated surgically but medically with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (37).
In autonomous adrenal cortisol excess, i.e., adrenal Cushing’s syndrome, adrenal androgens are usually 
downregulated due to reduced hypothalamic-pituitary feedback to the adrenal glands in response to the glu-
cocorticoid excess. However, steroid metabolome analysis in our large primary aldosteronism cohort revealed 
not only glucocorticoid excess, but normal or increased androgen output. Intriguingly, steroid pathway anal-
ysis revealed evidence for additional autonomous production of 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione, which is a 
major product of adrenal steroidogenesis (38) and a direct precursor to potent androgens (39, 40). Steroid 
pathway analysis results were strongly corroborated by the results of quantitative immunohistochemistry in 
aldosterone-producing adenoma tissue, demonstrating a significant association of intratumoral expression of 
the CYP11B1 enzyme, required for the synthesis of both glucocorticoids and 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione,

with in vivo excretion of the corresponding steroid metabolites. Intriguingly, cosecretion of glucocorticoids 
could also potentially explain the recent finding that adrenal vein sampling performs less well than previously 
assumed in differentiating unilateral from bilateral adrenal causes of primary aldosteronism (41), as this test 
relies on the assumption of an increase in the aldosterone over cortisol ratio in unilateral disease, which may 
be diluted in adenomas with cosecretion.
Glucocorticoid excess in mild, subclinical adrenal Cushing’s syndrome is associated with overnight 
dexamethasone test results that are regularly abnormal, while 24-hour urine glucocorticoid excretion 
is often normal. By contrast, we found that glucocorticoid excess in primary aldosteronism regularly 
presented with increased 24-hour urine glucocorticoid output preoperatively and one-third of patients 
showed evidence of compromised cortisol reserve postoperatively. However, only a few patients failed 
the overnight dexamethasone test and at present the reason for this is unclear. Patients with primary

pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease, another adrenal cause of glucocorticoid excess, do not sup-
press after dexamethasone either, but have been shown to paradoxically increase glucocorticoid produc-
tion in response to dexamethasone (42).
The high rate of patients failing cosyntropin testing following surgical removal of their aldosterone-
producing adrenal adenoma, 29% of consecutively recruited subjects, was confirmed in direct compari-
son to healthy controls measured by the same mass spectrometry–based assay. Adrenal insufficiency has 
not been appreciated as likely to occur postoperatively in primary aldosteronism, which in light of our 
findings now will have to be reconsidered. In our current experience, postoperative adrenal insufficiency

is transient, mostly recovering after 3 to 6 months. However, during this period patients are exposed 
to the potentially fatal risk of adrenal crisis as they are not able to appropriately increase their cortisol 
production in case of major illness or surgery. A recent study (43) was the first to assess the impact of 
unilateral adrenalectomy itself on cortisol reserve, documenting normal responses to cosyntropin test-
ing in 30 live kidney donors tested on postoperative days 1 and 28. One would have anticipated these 
results, given that the physiological response to adrenalectomy will be a counter-regulatory upregulation 
of ACTH, stimulating cortisol production in the remaining adrenal gland. Therefore, those recent find-
ings further corroborate that the high rate of failed responses to cosyntropin in our primary aldosteron-
ism patients cannot be explained by mere loss of adrenal tissue volume, but will be a consequence of 
preoperative cortisol excess, resulting in reduced responsiveness of the contralateral adrenal and hence 
reduced cosyntropin-stimulated cortisol output.
Conclusions. Our findings demonstrate that glucocorticoid excess is a highly prevalent feature in pri-
mary aldosteronism and closely linked to adverse metabolic risk; we also show evidence of autonomous 
adrenal androgen production in primary aldosteronism. Steroid metabolome analysis also demonstrated 
increased mineralocorticoid output in the Cushing comparator cohort, suggesting that the traditional divi-
sion into Cushing’s and Conn’s is not as clear cut as previously assumed. Steroid metabolomics is a highly 
sensitive diagnostic and biomarker tool in adrenal disease (44, 45), including primary aldosteronism (46, 
47); our study now demonstrates the value of steroid metabolome analysis as a discovery tool for the dis-
section of disease mechanisms. Further studies will have to assess the clinical impact of the discovery of 
“Connshing” syndrome, including prospective randomized studies to clarify whether primary aldosteron-
ism patients should receive additional glucocorticoid-opposing treatment when treated medically with min-
eralocorticoid receptor antagonists to efficiently counteract adverse metabolic risk.
Methods
Patients and controls. Patients and controls were recruited at 5 centers participating in the European Network 
for the Study of Adrenal Tumors. All participants provided written informed consent, and the study was 
approved by the ethics committee at each participating institution.
At the time of diagnosis, all primary aldosteronism patients underwent systematic metabolic and car-
diovascular phenotyping. Metabolic phenotyping was also carried out in healthy controls and the other 
comparator cohorts. Primary aldosteronism patients were compared to 5 comparator cohorts (Table 1): 
healthy controls (n = 162); patients with endocrine-inactive adrenal adenoma (n = 56); patients with adre-
nal adenomas associated with mild, subclinical Cushing’s syndrome (n = 104); and patients with overt clin-
ical Cushing’s syndrome (n = 47) due to a cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma. In the latter 3 groups, imag-
ing, histopathology, and follow-up investigations had confirmed the benign nature of the adrenal lesion.
The diagnosis of corticotropin-independent adrenal Cushing’s syndrome was based on a combination 
of clinical and biochemical features of hypercortisolism. Patients were classified as suffering from overt 
Cushing’s syndrome if they had at least 3 abnormal biochemical test results indicative of Cushing’s, in 
addition to insufficiently suppressed serum cortisol levels (>5 μg/dl [>138 nmol/l]) after overnight admin-
istration of 1 mg of dexamethasone. Biochemical tests considered indicative of Cushing’s were increased 
urinary excretion of free cortisol, increased late-night salivary cortisol levels, and suppressed plasma corti-
cotropin levels (<10 pg/ml [<2.2 pmol/l]).
Overt Cushing’s syndrome was also diagnosed if the patients had at least 2 biochemical results indica-
tive of Cushing’s in the presence of typical catabolic signs of hypercortisolism (i.e., muscle weakness, skin 
fragility, osteoporosis). Patients without typical catabolic signs, nonsuppressible serum cortisol levels, and 
up to 2 other abnormal biochemical tests were diagnosed as subclinical Cushing’s. For the purposes of our 
analysis, we divided the subclinical Cushing’s patients into 2 groups, in line with recently published con-
sensus diagnostic criteria (48): possible autonomous cortisol excess, SC1, and autonomous cortisol excess, 
SC2, defined by serum cortisol after overnight administration of 1 mg of dexamethasone (SC1: > 1.8 and 
≤ 5.0 μg/dl [> 51 and ≤ 138 nmol/l]); SC2: > 5.0 μg/dl [>138 nmol/l]). Patients were considered to have 
endocrine-inactive adrenal lesions if they had normal biochemical test results and no catabolic signs.
To independently confirm the findings arising from the exploratory primary aldosteronism cohort, we 
prospectively recruited 46 consecutive patients diagnosed with lateralized aldosteronism undergoing unilat-
eral adrenalectomy. In addition to 24-hour urine steroid profiling, they underwent preoperative assessment 
for glucocorticoid excess including dexamethasone (1 mg) overnight suppression test, late-night salivary

cortisol, and morning plasma ACTH; all patients underwent a postoperative cosyntropin test (serum corti-
sol at baseline and 30 minutes after intravenous injection of 250 μg ACTH1–24, Synacthen) 10–14 days after 
unilateral adrenalectomy.
Genetic analysis. In 88 patients who underwent adrenalectomy for aldosterone-producing adenoma, 
DNA was extracted from tumor tissue as described previously (49). DNA was subjected to targeted sequenc-
ing of genes previously identified to harbor somatic mutations in aldosterone-producing adenomas (KCNJ5, 
ATP1A1, ATP2B3, CACNA1D, and CTNNB1), as described previously (49). Thereby, tumor tissues from 54 
patients were found to harbor somatic mutations in the following genes: KCNJ5 (n = 31), ATP1A1 (n = 8), 
ATP2B3 (n = 4), CACNA1D (n = 6), CTNNB1 (n = 1), PRKACA (n = 2) (50), and CACNA1D+CTNNB1 (n 
= 2). Tumor tissue in the residual 34 patients did not contain any of these 5 somatic candidate mutations.
Clinical and biochemical metabolic phenotyping. Baseline anthropometric assessment in the patients with 
primary aldosteronism included height, body mass index (kg/m2), and standardized blood pressure mea-
surement using an automatic sphygmomanometer validated for clinical use (according to list on www.
dableducational.org). For blood pressure, the mean of 3 measurements separated by 5 minutes was deter-
mined and used for calculations.
Blood samples were drawn for fasting plasma glucose and insulin, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), total cho-
lesterol, high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides. Most participants (n = 107) also underwent a 75-g oral 
glucose tolerance test with blood sampling at 30-minute intervals for 2 hours. Subjects were categorized 
as having normal glucose tolerance on the basis of 2-hour glucose values (normal glucose tolerance < 140 
mg/dl [<7.8 mmol/l], impaired glucose tolerance ≥ 140 mg/dl [≥7.8 mmol/l]). HOMA-IR was calculated 
using the following formula: [fasting glucose (mmol/l) × fasting insulin (mIU/l)]/22.5.
Urine steroid metabolome analysis. All patients collected a 24-hour urine at the time of diagnosis of prima-
ry aldosteronism for analysis by quantitative gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in selected-
ion-monitoring (SIM) analysis mode, as described previously (45). For urinary steroid metabolite excretion 
analysis by quantitative GC-MS in SIM analysis mode, urinary steroids were enzymatically released from 
conjugation, with subsequent recovery of the hydrolyzed steroids by C18 solid-phase extraction (SPE) 
using Sep-Pak columns (Waters), followed by chemical derivatization prior to GC-MS-SIM analysis. A 
subcohort of 46 patients also collected 24-hour urine 6 to 12 months after unilateral adrenalectomy.
Our method allows for identification and quantification of 32 different steroid metabolites derived 
from mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, androgens, and their precursors; details are summarized in Sup-
plemental Table 2. 3α,5β-Tetrahydroaldosterone (THAldo) represents the major mineralocorticoid metabo-
lite. Total glucocorticoid production was assessed as the sum of quantified metabolites of cortisol and cor-
tisone, comprising tetrahydrocortisol (THF), 5α-tetrahydrocortisol (5α-THF), tetrahydrocortisone, α- and 
β-cortol, α- and β-cortolone, 6β-hydroxycortisol, and urinary cortisol and cortisone.
Hormonal assessments. We used validated and established liquid chromatography-tandem MS assays to 
measure serum cortisol (51), serum dexamethasone (52), and salivary cortisol (53). Cosyntropin test results 
were compared to those obtained in 82 healthy controls measured with the same assay; the diagnostic cut-
off for diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency was defined as the 5th centile of the healthy control cohort and 
determined as 15.6 μg/dl (430 nmol/l). Plasma ACTH was measured in EDTA plasma samples using a 
commercially available, automated chemiluminescence immunoassay (Liaison, Diasorin).
Serum dexamethasone concentrations greater than 2.2 μg/dl (>5.6 nmol/l) were considered indicative 
of a valid overnight dexamethasone suppression test. Salivary cortisol assay reference ranges were 0.2–1.7 
μg/dl (5–46 nmol/l) in the morning and less than 0.1 μg/dl (<2.6 nmol/l) in the evening. Plasma ACTH 
was measured in EDTA plasma samples using the Liaison chemiluminescence immunoassay. The assay 
employs 2 monoclonal antibodies directed against the N- and C-terminal end. Cross-reactivity with ACTH 
precursors and fragments is negligible. In our hands, the limit of quantification is 4 pg/ml with a reportable 
range from 4 to 1,500 pg/ml. Intra-assay coefficients of variability (CVs) ranged from 1.2% to 15.0% at con-
centrations of 355 and 5.8 pg/ml, while interassay CVs were 7.3% at 195 pg/ml and 12.7% at 14 pg/ml.
Tissue microarrays, immunohistochemistry, and digital image analysis. Tissue microarrays were constructed 
by sampling 3 tumor tissue cores (1.0 mm in diameter) as previously described (54). Paraffin-embedded tis-
sue blocks from 57 of the aldosterone-producing adenomas were utilized, which were selected on the basis 
of representative H&E–stained tissue sections of each case by the same pathologist (AW).
The technical construction of the tissue microarrays was performed on a manual tissue arrayer 
(AlphaMetrix Biotech). A semi-automated rotation microtome (Microm HM 355S, Thermo Fisher

Scientific) was used to cut 3-μm tissue microarray sections that were transferred to glass slides for 
immunohistochemistry and H&E staining.
Immunohistochemical staining was performed under standardized conditions on a Discovery XT auto-
mated stainer (Roche Diagnostics/Ventana Medical Systems) employing monoclonal antibodies directed 
against human CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 (55), provided by Celso Gomez-Sanchez, University of Missis-
sippi Medical Center, Jackson, Mississippi, USA. The slides were incubated with primary antibodies (rat 
monoclonal anti-hCYP11B1 [1:20], clone 80-2-2 or mouse monoclonal anti-hCYP11B2 [1:100], clone 
41-17B in Dako REAL antibody dilution, catalog S2022), and detected by the Discovery DAB Map Kit 
(Roche Diagnostics/Ventana Medical Systems), including incubation with respective secondary antibodies 
(anti-rat, Vector, catalog BA 4001 [1:300]; anti-mouse, ready-to-use universal secondary antibody, Roche 
Diagnostics/Ventana Medical Systems, catalog 760-4205).
Following immunohistochemistry, stained tissue microarray slides were scanned at ×20 objective mag-
nification using a digital Mirax Desk slide scanner (Zeiss Microimaging) prior to import into the image 
analysis software Definiens Developer XD2 (Definiens AG), as previously described (56). Tumor areas 
were annotated manually and a rule set was defined to detect and quantify staining intensities in the anno-
tated tumor area, with operators blinded with regard to corresponding in vivo steroid output.
Statistics. Summary statistics, comprising mean (standard deviation) and median [interquartile range] 
(dependent on the presence of outliers), and heatmap visualization, were used to describe the clinical char-
acteristics and the steroid metabolome of the patients included in this study. Initial analysis was undertaken 
using Mann-Whitney U tests comparing patients with primary aldosteronism and healthy controls; patients 
with unilateral adrenal adenoma and bilateral adrenal hyperplasia; and patients with primary aldosteron-
ism, endocrine inactive adrenal adenoma, subclinical adrenal Cushing’s (SC1 and SC2) and overt adrenal 
Cushing’s, with healthy controls.
Further analysis used linear regression models to adjust for age and sex in comparisons between all 6 
groups, and additionally adjust for body mass index in comparisons of primary aldosteronism and healthy 
controls, using log-transformed outcome data to reduce the impact of high outliers. Estimates from the 
regression model are presented with 95% confidence intervals and interpreted as approximate percentage 
differences (57). For the primary aldosteronism patients and the control subjects, separately, the associa-
tion between patient characteristics and both tetrahydroaldosterone and total glucocorticoid metabolites 
adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index differences was assessed by fitting linear regression models. 
Log-transformed outcome data were used to reduce the impact of high outliers, and estimates interpreted 
as approximate percentage changes per unit change in the characteristic (57).
Comparisons of steroid excretion before and after unilateral adrenalectomy were made using Wil-
coxon’s signed-rank test. Linear models were also fitted comparing preoperative and postoperative log 
transformed steroid-metabolite measures to controls, adjusting for age and sex. For the 57 patients with 
aldosterone-producing adenoma immunohistochemistry data, analyses were performed to assess the asso-
ciation between total glucocorticoid metabolites, 11β-hydoxyandrosterone and tetrahydroaldosterone, and 
the level from image analysis. Again, linear regression with log-transformed outcome data was used and 
estimates can be interpreted as approximate percentage changes.
All tests were 2-sided and a stringent P value (P ≤ 0.01) was considered as indicative of statistical 
significance given the exploratory nature and number of comparisons made in the analysis. The software 
packages R, Stata version 13, and MATLAB were used for analysis.
Study approval. Patients and controls were recruited at 5 centers participating in the European Network 
for the Study of Adrenal Tumors. All participants provided written informed consent, and the study proce-
dures were approved by the ethics committee at each participating institution.
