Abstract
Background The phenomenon of allergy transfer from an allergic donor to a non-allergic recipient via hematopoietic
cell transplantation has been described by several reports. However, it could not yet been conclusively shown that aller-
gic reaction of the recipient is elicited by the donor’s cells.
Objectives In the case of a 46-year-old male patient who – for the first time in his life – had two episodes of oral allergic
syndrome upon kiwi consumption after having received myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT)
from his kiwi-allergic sister, we aimed to clarify the origin of allergen reactive cells in the donor. We not only intended to
demonstrate if allergy was transferred by HCT but also to present an experimental workup for the analysis of allergy
transfer by HCT.
Methods Allergic sensitization to kiwi in recipient and donor was proven by ImmunoCAP. Furthermore, origin of periph-
eral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was analyzed by chromosomal fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). To con-
firm allergic reaction and activation of hematopoietic cells by customized kiwi extract, we performed basophil activation
test from whole blood as well as T cell proliferation assays from purified PBMCs of both recipient and donor.
Results Basophil activation upon kiwi extract was demonstrated in both recipient and donor. Besides, we showed pro-
liferation of CD4+ T cells after incubation with kiwi extract. FISH analysis proved that hematopoietic cells of the male reci-
pient completely originated from the female donor.
Conclusion Exemplified in this patient, we show for the first time that allergy transfer is mediated by the donor’s cells.
Moreover, our experimental approach using customized kiwi extract to prove contribution of kiwi-specific T and B cells
in both kiwi-allergic recipient and donor could serve as a model approach for future studies.

Introduction
Transfer of allergic diseases after allogeneic hematopoietic cell
transplantation (HCT) is described by several reports of
patients who developed allergic diseases after HCT.1–3 How-
ever, a final proof of direct transfer of allergy has not been
given so far.
Here, we present a case of allergy transfer following HCT and
show for the first time that allergy is transferred and elicited by
the donor’s cells. Moreover, we propose a feasible experimental
approach to investigate allergy transfer via HCT.

 lymphocytic leukaemia. Three weeks after HCT and again sev-
eral months thereafter he experienced, for the first time in his
life, two episodes of oral allergic syndrome upon kiwi consump-
tion. Both, recipient and donor, reported itching and burning
sensation of lips and mouth as well as oral swelling upon kiwi
consumption and thus maintained dietary exclusion.
We first confirmed allergic sensitization to kiwi by routine
serum ImmunoCAP (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA)4 analysis of both HCT recipient and donor which showed
significantly upregulated IgE level for kiwi allergen (Fig. 1a). To
rule out the possibility that kiwi allergy was caused by residual
cells of the recipient, chromosomal FISH (Abbott, Wiesbaden,
Germany) was performed with probes for the centromeric
region of the X-chromosome and the heterochromatic region on
the long arm of the Y-chromosome respectively (Fig. 1b,c). All
PBMCs of the male recipient showed two signals for the X-chro-
mosome and none for the Y-chromosome confirming that
hematopoietic cells of the recipient completely originated from
the female donor.
To gain an extended insight into specific immune cell
responses causing the kiwi allergy beyond routine diagnostics,
further cell culture experiments were designed. Like Mempel
et al. who have successfully desensitized a patient with severe
kiwi
allergy
by
customized
sublingual
swallow
allergen
immunotherapy, we prepared kiwi extract by homogenization of
fresh kiwi fruit pulp.5 We then cleared the lysate by a centrifuga-
tion step and adjusted pH to 7.0. The kiwi extract was then
sterile filtrated and heat inactivated at 90 °C for 10 min to inac-
tivate potentially harmful proteases (Fig. S1a). Protein concen-
tration as measured by BCA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was
36 mg/mL. Before using in cell culture experiments, the extract
was titrated on PBMCs to define non-toxic concentrations by
Live/Dead staining. 1.44 mg/mL of the kiwi extract was defined
as non-toxic concentration (Fig. S1b,c) and used in all following
assays.
In a first step, Kiwi extract was used for basophil activation
test (BAT, B€
uhlmann, Sch€
onenbuch, Switzerland) with blood of
both, HCT recipient and donor as well as with blood of a non-
kiwi-allergic control (Fig. 2a,b). Robust basophil activation was
observed in recipient and donor (32.3% and 77.3% activated
basophils respectively), which is contrasted by absent basophil
activation in the non-allergic control (0.63% activated baso-
phils) confirming kiwi-specific effect. To detect IgE independent
contribution to kiwi allergy, we designed two different prolifera-
tion assays. Radioactive labelled Thymidine (3H) incorporation
of PBMCs after treatment with Kiwi extract showed increased
proliferation of cells from the recipient and the donor (6.9 and
3.4 fold respectively), whereas no proliferation could be detected
for the non-allergic control (Fig. 2c). We next investigated
CFSE-labelled PBMCs incubated with kiwi extract for 7 days.
FACS analysis was used to determine kiwi-specific proliferation
and to further characterize proliferating cells on single-cell level
(Fig. 2d,e). Increased percentage of proliferating CD3+ T cells
(CSFE low) (CFSElowCD3+) from the recipient as well as from
the donor after treatment with kiwi extract (3.3% and 9.7%
respectively, Fig. 2d) was consistent with the data from the Thy-
midine incorporation assay. Moreover, we found that the prolif-
erating T cell population was mainly CD4 positive (94.2% for
the recipient and 89.5% for the donor, Fig. 2e). Additionally, a
high percentage of T cells were positive for CD86 underlining
their memory phenotype6 (83.3% for the recipient and 77.3%
for the donor, Fig. 2e).
Discussion
The hypothesis that allergies may be transferred via HCT has
been proposed for long time.1 As food allergies and, in particu-
lar, kiwi allergy are less common than, for example, pollen
allergy7,8 the argument of spontaneous acquisition of allergy
seems unlikely in our patient. Moreover, we could clearly rule
out this possibility in our HCT recipient: Besides many reported
cases of allergy transfer by HCT, we could prove, for the first

 time, that allergy was definitely elicited by the donor’s cells as
the recipient showed complete chimerism and therefore kiwi-
reactive cells in the HCT recipient were fully derived from the
donor.
Transfer of IgE has been assumed to be responsible for allergic
reactions in the recipient; however, this mechanism is irrelevant
in our recipient. As IgE was shown to have a short half-life,9
transferred donor’s IgE cannot elicit allergic reactions several
months after HCT and can even less explain elevated IgE levels
for Kiwi allergen 20 years after HCT as in our recipient.1 In con-
trast, our data clearly show a contribution of kiwi-specific T and
B cells including a high percentage of memory T cells that are
derived from the donor.
Kiwi allergy has been shown to be reliably detectable via
prick-to-prick tests with fresh kiwi fruits. In contrast, commer-
cially available ImmunoCAP tests and skin prick test extracts for

Figure 2 Immune cell response of kiwi-allergic HCT donor and kiwi-allergic recipient. (a) BAT revealed increased basophil activation
(CCR3+CD63+) for the recipient (white bar) as well as for the donor (green bar) upon stimulation with kiwi extract compared to unstimu-
lated controls (control) and kiwi stimulation of cells from a non-allergic control (grey bar). a-FceR and fMLP served as positive controls
and showed proper basophil reactivity of recipient, donor and non-allergic donor. (b) Representative FACS plots of BAT from the recipient
upon kiwi stimulation (upper row) and background control (lower row) show gating strategy on activated basophils. (c) Proliferation of
PBMCs of the recipient as well as of the donor was observed upon kiwi stimulation after 7 days compared to unstimulated controls (con-
trol) and kiwi-stimulated cells from a non-allergic control as measured by radioactive labelled thymidine (3H) incorporation. PHA served as
a positive control and showed proper proliferation capacity of PBMCs from the recipient, the donor as well as from non-allergic control.
(d) Monitoring of CFSE-labelled PBMCs after 7 days by FACS analysis showed significant proliferation of kiwi-stimulated CD3+ T cells
(CD3+CFSE low) from the recipient as well as from the donor compared to unstimulated cells (control) and kiwi-stimulated cells from a
non-allergic control. PHA as a positive control showed proper proliferation capacity of CD3+ T cells from the recipient, the donor as well
as from the non-allergic control. (e) Further staining of proliferating CD3+ T cells upon kiwi stimulation for CD4, CD8 and CD86 showed a
predominance of the CD4+CD86+ phenotype.

 kiwi had reached significantly lower sensitivities10 and are not
compatible for use in cell culture experiments. Here, we showed
that converting kiwi fruit into an extract applicable for cell cul-
ture experiments is possible. Besides, we confirm previous find-
ings that heat processed kiwi fruit can still induce IgE
reactivity11 and moreover, can stimulate T cells.
Our case is unique in showing clearly donor T and B cells
contribution over simple IgE transmission in long-lasting allergy
transfer after HCT. Besides, rather allergen-specific proliferating
Th cells than proliferating B cells seem to play a role in the
pathogenesis of allergy as shown by Ueno-Yamanouchi et al.,
which is also underlined by our data showing CD3+CD4+ T cells
as kiwi-specific proliferating cell population with a memory phe-
notype.12
Allergy transfer via HCT is a rare phenomenon though
insights into mechanisms would certainly extend knowledge
concerning the pathophysiology of allergy. Thus, detailed experi-
mental work-up of every single case of allergy transfer is
required. In our case, we were only able to experimentally char-
acterize the status of kiwi allergy in recipient and donor after
HCT. However, with this case we propose a model work-up test-
ing specific allergies on multiple cellular levels by customized
extracts that could be used for prospective cohort analyses char-
acterizing donors and recipients for specific allergies in detail
before and after HCT.
