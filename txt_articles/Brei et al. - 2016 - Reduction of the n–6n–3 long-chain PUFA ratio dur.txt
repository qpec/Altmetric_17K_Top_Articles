ABSTRACT
Background: It has been hypothesized that the n–6:n–3 (v-6:v-3)
long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) ratio in the mater-
nal diet during the prenatal and early postnatal phase positively
affects the body composition of the offspring. However, only lim-
ited data from prospective human intervention studies with long-
term follow-up are available.
Objective: We assessed the long-term effects of a reduced n–6:n–3
LCPUFA ratio in the diets of pregnant and lactating women [1020 mg
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) plus 180 mg eicosapentaenoic acid
(EPA)/d together with an arachidonic acid–balanced diet com-
pared with a control diet] on the body weights and compositions
of their offspring from 2 to 5 y of age with a focus on the 5-y
results.
Design: Participants in the randomized controlled trial received follow-
up assessments with annual body-composition measurements including
skinfold thickness (SFT) measurements (primary outcome), a so-
nographic assessment of abdominal subcutaneous and preperitoneal
fat, and child growth. In addition, abdominal MRI was performed in
a subgroup of 5-y-old children. For the statistical analysis, mixed
models for repeated measures (MMRMs) were fit with the use of
data from each visit since birth (except for MRI).
Results: Maternal LCPUFA supplementation did not significantly
influence the children’s sum of 4 SFTs [means 6 SDs at 5 y of age:
intervention, 23.9 6 4.7 mm (n = 57); control, 24.5 6 5.0 mm (n =
55); adjusted mean difference, 20.5 (95% CI: 22.2, 1.2)], growth,
or ultrasonography measures at any time point in the adjusted
MMRM model (all P values , 0.05). Results were consistent with
abdominal MRI measurements (n = 44) at 5 y of age, which showed
no significant differences in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tis-
sue volumes and ratios.
Conclusion: The current study provides no evidence that a dietary
reduction of the n–6:n–3 LCPUFA ratio in the maternal diet during
pregnancy and lactation is a useful early preventive strategy against
obesity at preschool age. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.

INTRODUCTION
The increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity, partic-
ularly in early life stages, has negative implications for in-
dividuals and society as a whole (1). To prevent and overcome
this problem, different approaches are being pursued on a global
level (2). These methods include approaches that are based on the
concept of fetal programming, which hypothesizes that the in-
trauterine environment during the prenatal period is associated
with lifelong, adverse health-related outcomes in the offspring.
One such outcome is risk of obesity and its associated diseases
(3). Specific emphasis has been placed on intake and the ratio of
essential n–3 and n–6 long-chain PUFAs (LCPUFAs)9 because
they may be involved in early adipocyte differentiation (4). On
the basis of in vitro and animal studies (5), it was hypothesized
that the ratio of n–6:n–3 LCPUFA intake during the prenatal and
early postnatal period influences the development of fat mass in
offspring, with a lower ratio preventing excess adipose tissue
development (6).

 On the basis of this consideration, several prospective human
cohort studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been
performed that investigated the impact observed on altering the
n–6:n–3 fatty acid ratio. These studies showed conflicting results
(7–12). However, they were mostly post hoc analyses in trials
that were primarily designed to investigate other outcomes such
as infant neurodevelopment. To our knowledge, the INFAT
(Impact of Nutritional Fatty Acids during Pregnancy and Lac-
tation on Early Human Adipose Tissue Development) study was
the first human RCT to focus on the impact of a dietary change
or modification of the n–6:n–3 LCPUFA ratio in pregnant and
lactating women on infant adipose tissue growth as the primary
outcome. Supplementation with fish-oil capsules (1020 mg
DHA plus 180 mg EPA/d) together with an arachidonic acid
(AA)–balanced diet provided no evidence that this dietary in-
tervention could prevent excess adipose tissue growth in infants
#1 y of age (13, 14). According to a recent meta-analysis by
Stratakis et al. (15), there is currently no conclusive evidence to
support a favorable programming effect of n–3 LCPUFA sup-
plementation during pregnancy or lactation on BMI of preschool
children. However, because of between-study heterogeneity and
methodologic limitations, such as small sample sizes or selective
attrition rates, the authors claimed that additional high-quality
studies are required (15). Furthermore, the need to assess the
long-term effects has also been highlighted (15–18). To assess the
long-term effects of the intervention, the infants in the INFAT
study were followed up until they reached preschool age. In the
current article, we present the findings of the follow-up study with
a primary focus on the 5-y results.
METHODS
The INFAT study was conducted as an open-label, mono-
center, randomized, controlled dietary intervention trial with 2
parallel groups, with each group consisting of 104 pregnant
women. Originally, the study was designed to investigate the
effect of a reduction in the n–6:n–3 LCPUFA ratio in the diets of
pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers on adipose tissue
growth in their infants aged #1 y. To investigate the long-term
effects, the infants were followed up until the age of 5 y. Details
of the rationale, study design (including the sample-size de-
termination, eligibility criteria, and process of random assign-
ment), participant characteristics, and clinical results on the fat
mass of infants #1 y old together with maternal and fetal fatty
acid profiles have been previously described (13, 14, 19).
Subjects
In total, 208 healthy, pregnant women with a mean age of 32 y
and a mean prepregnancy BMI (in kg/m2) of 22 were recruited
before the 15th wk of gestation between July 2006 and May
2009. From enrollment until 4 mo postpartum, women in the
intervention group received 1200 mg LCPUFAs (1020 mg DHA
plus 180 mg EPA plus 9 mg vitamin E) as fish-oil capsules daily.
In addition, the dietary n–6:n–3 LCPUFA ratio was further re-
duced through specific, individualized dietary counseling aimed
at lowering AA intake. The control group received general
recommendations regarding healthy nutrition during pregnancy.
Baseline maternal clinical characteristics, dietary habits, lifestyle
factors, and sociodemographic variables did not differ significantly
between the 2 study groups. Within the study, 188 women gave
birth to healthy infants (n = 90 girls; n = 98 boys) with a mean
difference in pregnancy duration of 4.8 d (95% CI: 1.19, 7.67)
between study groups. For the initial study, infants were assessed
at #1 y of age (13, 14). Follow-up assessments were performed
between February 2008 and November 2014 to detect the possible
long-term effects of the intervention in the offspring at 2, 3, 4, and
5 y of age. All follow-up assessments included the same mea-
surements of infant growth and fat mass that were performed
during the first year of life with skinfold thickness (SFT) mea-
surements remaining as the primary outcome measurement. Par-
ticipant data were collected at the study center or were assessed by
a study team member during a home visit. Furthermore, an ab-
dominal MRI at 5 y of age (Department of Radiology, Klinikum
rechts der Isar, Munich) and the assessment of the children’s diet
and physical activity (PA) at 3 respective time points (3, 4, and 5 y
of age) were investigated. The ethical committee of the Technische
Universita
¨t Mu
¨nchen approved the study protocol (1479/06/2009/
10/26). Written informed consent for follow-up was obtained from
both parents of each child.
Child growth and development
For infants #2 y of age, weight was measured to the nearest
10 g with the use of a standard infant scale (Babywaage Ultra
MBSC-55; myweight), and length was measured with the use of
a measuring stick (Sa
¨uglingsmessstab seca 207; seca) to the
nearest 0.5 cm while the infant was supine with stretched legs.
At later time points, a standard flat scale (Seca Clara 803; seca)
was used to determine weight to the nearest 100 g. In addition,
a stadiometer (Stadiometer seca 214; seca) was used to measure
the child height to the nearest 0.5 cm with both measures per-
formed with the child in a standing position. BMI percentiles
were determined with the use of the German reference group
according to Kromeyer-Hauschild et al. (20).
Fat mass and fat distribution of the children
SFT
The infant’s SFTs as a primary outcome was measured in
triplicate with the use of a Holtain caliper (Holtain Ltd.) at 4
different body sites on the left body axis (triceps, biceps, sub-
scapular, and suprailiac). Measurements were performed at 2, 3,
4, and 5 y of age at the study center or at the family’s home. For
each site, the mean of the 3 measurements was used for the SFT
value, and the sum of the 4 SFTs was calculated. Fat mass and
the percentage of body fat were calculated with the use of
predictive skinfold regression equations according to Weststrate
and Deurenberg (21).
Ultrasound
In addition, ultrasonography was performed to determine
abdominal subcutaneous and preperitoneal fat areas with the
use of a high-resolution ultrasonographic system (Siemens
Acuson 3150 Premium; Siemens) at 2, 3, 4, and 5 y of age. The
originally described method from Holzhauer et al. (22) was
slightly modified for our purposes and has been described in
detail (23). Three trained research assistants (CB, SB, and K
Pusch) collected data on infant growth, SFT measurements,
and ultrasounds.

 MRI measurement
In addition, abdominal MRI in a subgroup of 5-y old children
was performed to quantify abdominal adipose tissue. Although
all participating families were approached, data for the analysis
were only available from 44 children. Before the examination,
additional written informed consent was obtained from the ac-
companying parent. An MRI examination was performed without
sedation on a clinical whole body scanner at 1.5 T (Magnetom
Avanto; Siemens Medical Solutions). The children were posi-
tioned supine (feet first) with arms next to their bodies and with
spine array receive coils included in the patient table. In addition,
a body matrix coil was applied ventrally, which covered the entire
abdominal region. To mitigate the possible degradation of image
quality because of the limited ability to comply with the MRI
scan, the imaging protocol had to be kept as short as possible. The
quantitative scans were planned on localizer images, the latter of
which were obtained under free-breathing conditions (field of
view: 500 mm; 3 orientations; duration: 13 s). Water and fat
separation was based on a 4-point (echo time: 2.38, 4.76, 7.15,
and 9.53 ms) Dixon technique as described by Glover (24). The
total measurement consisted of a series of blocks of 4 transverse
spoiled gradient echo images, which were acquired in inspiration
(breath hold of 3.9 s). The resolution was 2.34 3 2.34 mm2 in
plane and 10 mm in the head-feet direction (80 mm slice
thickness and an additional gap of 2 mm). Additional imaging
variables included repetition time of 50 ms, flip angle of 558, and
a monopolar readout gradient to avoid phase shifts between in-
phase and opposed-phase images.
Postprocessing of MRI data
The acquired data were exported to a remote workstation and
analyzed with self-written software in the MatLab program
(R2014b; MathWorks) according to the procedure outlined by
Glover (24). On the basis of the phase images, a (smoothed) B0
map was calculated that included a local off resonance and
a hardware-related offset (coil phase) with the exclusion of the
chemical shift between water and fat. Subsequently, the complex
images were B0 corrected and transformed into real-value im-
ages. The ratio of the in-phase and opposed-phase magnitude
images (evaluated independently and subsequently averaged)
allowed for an estimate of the T2* decay, which further improved
the water and fat separation (24). Finally, the water and fat images
were calculated with the use of the Dixon approach. Images were
further used for subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral
adipose tissue (VAT) segmentation.
MRI analysis: SAT and VAT segmentation
For image analyses, single slices that were bounded by the
head of the liver to the iliac crest were manually identified
from 2 individuals (C Cordes and CB). Selected slice images
were automatically analyzed with a segmentation algorithm
written in MatLab software (R2014b) according to the method
of Cordes et al. (25). This algorithm was used to obtain an
initial fat classification of the following 3 compartments: 1)
SAT, which is the fraction between the dermis and external
fascia of the abdominal muscle wall; 2) VAT, which is within
the inner contour of the SAT compartment; and 3) nonadipose
tissue (NAT), which is the remaining fraction (mostly water).
Image processing required manual correction and was con-
ducted by a single person (CB). Volumes of SAT, VAT, and
NAT were quantified by summing the individual slices. Ratios
of SAT, VAT, and NAT volumes to total volume were also
generated.
Dietary intake
The children’s diets were assessed with the use of 3-d esti-
mated food records at 3, 4, and 5 y of age and were completed
by their parents or the daycare personnel. Data were entered in
a standardized manner by one person (M-TK) with the use of
OptiDiet Plus software (version 5.1.2.065; GOE mbH), which
is a program that is based on a German nutrient database
(Bundeslebensmittelschlu
¨ssel). Energy and macronutrient intake
were analyzed.
PA questionnaires
We assessed the PA and inactivity of the children with the use
of a basic questionnaire from the German Health Interview and
Examination Survey for children and adolescents at 3 respective
time points (3, 4, and 5 y of age) (26, 27). One of the parents of
each child filled out the questionnaire during the follow-up visits
or at home. The protocol contained questions on play, exercise,
television viewing, and computer consumption and was evaluated
by a single person (M-TK).
Statistical analysis
All analyses were based on children who actively participated
at the follow-up. For each group, means 6 SDs of anthropo-
metric data, SFT, and ultrasound data are presented for children
at 2, 3, 4, and 5 y of age; dietary values are presented for
children at 3, 4, and 5 y of age; and MRI analyses are presented
for children at 5 y of age. For outcomes measured more than
once (all except MRI), likelihood-based mixed models for re-
peated measures (MMRMs) according to Bell et al. (28) were fit
with the use of data from each visit (birth and 6 wk, 4 mo, and 1,
2, 3, 4, and 5 y of age). The independent variables included were
the visit number as a factor variable and indicator variables for
the group assignment at each visit. In adjusted analyses, sex and
pregnancy duration were also included as independent variables.
Unstructured covariance matrices were used to model the
within-subject error. Although the difference in groups at 5 y of
age was the focus of this study, estimated mean differences
between the groups are presented for each measure at each time
point together with 95% CIs. For the MRI data, differences
between groups were analyzed with the use of simple and
multiple linear regression models that were adjusted for sex and
pregnancy duration. The binary outcomes from the PA ques-
tionnaire were compared between groups, at each time point
separately, with the use of chi-square tests. All statistical anal-
yses were performed with the use of the statistical program R
(version R 3.1.3; R Foundation for Statistical Computing); in
particular, the mixed models were fit with the use of the gls
function within the nlme library and with PASW software
(version 21.0; SPSS Inc.). A 2-sided P value ,0.05 was con-
sidered statistically significant, and no correction was made for
multiple comparisons.

 RESULTS
Participants
Of the 208 women included at the beginning of the study, data
for the body composition of 170 children (81.7%) were available
at 1 y of age (13). For the follow-up study, we analyzed the data
from 118 children at 2 y of age (56.7%), 120 children at 3 y of age
(57.7%), 107 children at 4 y of age (51.4%), and 114 children at
5 y of age (54.8%) with similar numbers between study groups (at
5 y: intervention group, n = 58; control group, n = 56). Data from
all children who participated at the follow-up are presented in
Figure 1. The most common reasons for dropout were a lack of
time or relocation.
Child growth and development
Growth patterns, including weight, height, and head, arm, and
waist circumferences for children aged between 2 and 5 y are
summarized in Table 1. These outcome variables did not sig-
nificantly differ between the intervention and control group in
the unadjusted and adjusted MMRM analyses at any time point
except for weight and BMI at 4 y of life. These 2 variables
showed significantly higher values for the intervention group in
the unadjusted analysis but not in the adjusted analysis. BMI
percentiles, which were estimated with the use of German ref-
erence data (20), showed values in the recommended range for
most but not all children. For example, 51 of 58 children aged

 5 y (87.9%) from the intervention group and 49 of 56 children
aged 5 y (87.5%) from the control group were within the rec-
ommended range. There was no significant evidence of a dif-
ference in BMI percentiles between groups at 5 y of age
(adjusted mean difference at 5 y: 1.6; 95% CI: 27.2, 10.3). At
5 y of age, 5.2% of the children in the intervention group were
defined as overweight (including obesity), and 1.7% of the
children in the intervention group were defined as obese com-
pared with 3.6% of children who were overweight and 0% of
children who were obese in the control group.
Fat mass and fat distribution of the children
SFT
Results for the sums of the 4 SFTs from 2, 3, 4, and 5 y are
provided in Table 2. At 5 y of age, the sum of 4 SFTs (sum of
the 4 individual SFTs) was 23.9 6 4.7 mm in the intervention
group (n = 57) and 24.5 6 5.0 mm in the control group (n = 55),
with no significant evidence of a difference between groups
provided by the unadjusted or adjusted analyses. Similar results
were observed when the 4 individual SFTs were analyzed sep-
arately (Supplemental Table 1). Likewise, the percentage of
body fat and body fat mass (kg) as estimated by the SFT
equations (21) did not significantly differ between groups during
the follow-up period. The same results applied to lean body
mass (kg) and the percentage of lean body mass (Table 2).
Ultrasound
Table 3 presents results from the adipose tissue growth and
abdominal fat distribution at 2, 3, 4, and 5 y of age as assessed
with the use of ultrasonography. Consistent with the SFT mea-
surements, the unadjusted and adjusted analyses showed com-
parable abdominal subcutaneous and preperitoneal fat areas with
increasing mean values observed over time. At 5 y of age, the
adjusted mean difference between the groups was 0.28 mm2
(95% CI: 24.75, 5.31 mm2) in the preperitoneal area, 22.29 mm2
(95% CI: 26.91, 2.34 mm2) in the subcutaneous areasagittal and
23.88 mm2 (95% CI: 211.22, 3.46 mm2) in the subcutaneous
areaaxial. There was also no evidence of a difference in the fat
distribution between groups on the basis of the preperitoneal:
subcutaneous ratio in the sagittal plane (adjusted mean difference
at 5 y of age: 0.49; 95% CI: 20.25, 1.24).

 MRI
In a subgroup of 44 children, an additional abdominal MRI was
performed at 5 y of age (Table 4). The mean number of analyzed
slices was 16.6 6 1.2 in the intervention group (n = 22) compared
with 16.7 6 1.3 in the control group (n = 22). Mean SAT, VAT,
and NAT volumes did not differ between control and intervention
groups [SAT-volume adjusted mean difference: 28.84 cm3 (95%
CI: 2105.51, 87.83 cm3); VAT-volume adjusted mean difference:
27.18 cm3 (95% CI: 228.65, 14.29 cm3); NAT-volume adjusted
mean difference: 160.44 cm3 (95% CI: 262.48, 383.37 cm3)].
Similarly, the calculated percentages (SAT, VAT, and NAT ratio)
were not significantly different between groups after adjustment
for sex and pregnancy duration. Therefore, these findings were
consistent with the results of the other methods.
Dietary intake
Mean energy in kcal and MJ and macronutrient intakes in
grams and percentages of energy are provided in Table 5. There
was a gradual increase in the mean energy intake in both groups.
However, the mean proportion of caloric intake from carbohy-
drates, fat, and protein did not change notably over time. In the
investigated period, the analysis of the mean daily energy and
macronutrient intakes showed no significant evidence of a group
difference in daily energy and macronutrient intakes at any time
point.
PA
The results of the PA questionnaires provided no evidence
regarding differences between groups in active or sedentary
behaviors (Supplemental Table 2). At 5 y of age, 53 of 58
children (91%) in the intervention group and 50 of 54 children
(93%) in the control group regularly participated in a sport ac-
tivity ($1 time/wk). Furthermore, all children in both groups
played outside $3 times/wk. As regards sedentary behavior, 19
of 54 children (35%) in the control group and 16 of 58 children
(28%) in the intervention group regularly watched television or
played on a computer $1 h/d [number of children who played
on a computer $1 h/d: intervention group: one of 58 (2%);
control group: one of 54 (2%)].
DISCUSSION
Our previous analysis did not provide any evidence that

 plus 180 mg EPA/d) combined with an AA-balanced diet in
pregnant and lactating women had an effect on adipose tissue
growth in their offspring for #1 y of life (as indicated by SFT
measurements and ultrasonography) (13). With the use of the
same methods, we followed this cohort carefully up to the
fifth year of life. Data from the current study revealed no
evidence of any long-term effects of the intervention at 2, 3,
4, and 5 y of age, which was consistent with our previous
findings (the observed significant difference in weight and
BMI between the 2 groups in the unadjusted MMRM model at
4 y of age should be treated with caution because it may be an
artifact of multiple testing). In addition, abdominal MRI
measurements at 5 y of age in a subgroup of children showed
no significant difference in abdominal fat distribution (SAT
and VAT) between intervention and control groups. Further-
more, we showed no differences in dietary energy and mac-
ronutrient intakes or PA over the time period between the 2
groups.

 The strengths and uniqueness of the current follow-up study
are that it provides one of the largest sets of combined methods
for the assessment of body composition and fat distribution.
Other RCTs have primarily assessed growth measures, such as
weight, height (29), BMI and/or BMI z scores (30–33), waist and
head circumferences (29, 33), and SFT measurements (33) in
preschool-age children. In the current study, we combined sev-
eral methods (anthropometric measures, SFT measurements,
and ultrasound) in a longitudinal approach with annual assess-
ments. With consideration of the importance of MRI measure-
ments as a gold standard, providing one of the most precise
estimates of adipose tissue deposition in children (34), this
method was used to complement our 5-y results. With the use of
several tools of body-composition assessments in a combina-
tional approach (all of which indicated the same conclusion), the
current study contributes strong evidence that suggests that re-
ducing the n–6:n–3 LCPUFA ratio in the maternal diet during
pregnancy and lactation does not affect adipose tissue growth in
preschool-age children.
Another strength of our study was the use of 3-d estimated food
records, which are a valid instrument to assess diet in toddlers and
children (35). The exploration of preschool child nutrition over
time revealed that energy and macronutrient intakes were not
significantly different between study groups. Likewise, the
concentration of PA was regularly assessed with the use of
validated instruments and was also shown to be not signifi-
cantly different between groups, thereby excluding relevant
confounding by lifestyle influences.
Our findings are consistent with the current scientific literature.
A number of reviews on this topic have emerged (15–17, 36–38).
The latest review, which primarily focused on early fatty acid
exposure and obesity risk in later life, concluded that current
data from observational studies and RCTs have been in-
consistent. However, the data available provide little evidence to
support the proposed fatty acid hypothesis (16). Our results are
similar to those in the meta-analysis conducted by Stratakis et al.
(15) on the effect of an n–3 LCPUFA supplementation during
pregnancy or lactation on adiposity status in childhood. Stratakis
et al. included 6 RCTs with a total of 2847 participants in the
meta-analysis. For the preschool-age category (#5 y), they
examined 4 RCTs and looked at BMI as the primary out-
come. They showed no effect of a maternal n–3 LCPUFA

LONG-CHAIN PUFAs AND OFFSPRING BODY COMPOSITION

 supplementation during pregnancy and/or lactation on childhood
BMI and without an association of the supplemented n–3
LCPUFA dosage or age (15). Preschool-age (#5-y) and school-
age (6–12-y) data of 4 primary and follow-up studies each were
included in the meta-analysis. However, to our knowledge, there
has only been one study to date with a follow-up period that
extended into adolescence (.13 y of age) that reported data on
body composition at the age of 19 y with no difference in BMI
and waist circumference (39).
Some limitations may have weakened our findings such as the
small sample size that included only 104 pregnant women/study
group. Because the study was initially planned for 1 y, there was
a relatively high attrition rate after this particular time with
a slight decrease that continued over the follow-up period. These
factors resulted in the loss of statistical power. However, con-
siderable efforts were made to obtain the compliance of the
families, in particular for the 5-y follow-up. Because of missing
outcome data, an MMRM approach was used for the analysis
with the use of data from each visit (birth and 6 wk, 4 mo, and 1,
2, 3, 4, and 5 y of age). This approach has been recommended for
the analysis of longitudinal data from an RCT, and it is a valid
method under the assumption that data are missing at random. We
considered this assumption that data were missing at random,
which was conditional on the observed values for each outcome,
to be reasonable for our study (28). With consideration of the
open-label design of this study, both participants and inves-
tigators who performed the measurements and analysis were
not blinded to the treatment, which may have introduced
a potential bias. In addition, our sample was rather lean at the time
of study entry (mean prepregnancy BMI: 22) and relatively well
educated. These factors may have reflected a more health-con-
scious behavior in our study group than is present in the general
population. This behavior might have resulted in lower preva-
lence rates in children who were overweight or obese at 5 y of age
than the current German prevalence rates from school-enrollment
examinations (prevalence of overweight including obesity: 8.4–
11.9%; prevalence of obesity: 3.3–5.4%) (40). Furthermore, we
determined energy intake and expenditure with the use of 3-d es-
timated food records and PA questionnaires, which may not have
accurately reflected the true values in terms of underreporting and
overreporting, respectively. The given information, which was
provided by parents or daycare personnel, could be, for example,
biased because of social desirability (41).
In conclusion, the current study does not provide evidence that
a dietary reduction of the n–6:n–3 LCPUFA ratio would be
a useful early preventive strategy against obesity at preschool
age. One strong point of the current study is the use of several
tools of body-composition assessment in a combinational ap-
proach and longitudinal manner with consistent results. How-
ever, the impact of LCPUFAs during pregnancy and lactation on
offspring adipose tissue development is still a subject of interest.
Data for adolescents and adults are limited.
