ABSTRACT
Metabolic acidosis is associated with poor outcomes in CKD. Because impaired renal ammonium excretion
is important in the pathogenesis of acidosis, urine ammonium excretion might be a better and perhaps
earlier acid–base indicator of risk than serum bicarbonate, particularly in patients without acidosis. We
evaluated the association between baseline ammonium excretion and clinical outcomes in African Amer-
ican Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension participants (n=1044). Median daily ammonium excretion
was 19.5 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 6.5 to 43.2) mEq. In Cox regression models (adjusted for
demographics, measured GFR, proteinuria, body mass index, net endogenous acid production, and serum
potassium and bicarbonate), hazard ratios of the composite outcome of death or dialysis were 1.46 (95%
CI, 1.13 to 1.87) in the low tertile and 1.14 (95% CI, 0.89 to 1.46) in the middle tertile of daily ammonium
excretion compared with the high tertile. Among participants without acidosis at baseline, the adjusted
hazard ratio for those with ammonium excretion ,20 mEq/d was 1.36 (95% CI, 1.09 to 1.71) compared with
those with ammonium excretion $20 mEq/d. Additionally, compared with participants in the high ammo-
nium tertile, those in the low ammonium tertile had higher adjusted odds of incident acidosis at 1 year
(adjusted odds ratio, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.04 to 6.27). In conclusion, low ammonium excretion is associated with
death and renal failure in hypertensive kidney disease, even among those without acidosis. Low ammo-
nium excretion could identify patients with CKD and normal bicarbonate levels who might benefit from
alkali before acidosis develops.

In nondialysis-requiring CKD, the prevalence of
metabolic acidosis, typically defined as serum total
carbon dioxide (tCO2) ,22 mEq/L, is approxi-
mately 15%.1,2 The prevalence increases with ad-
vancing CKD, from 7% in stage 2 to 37% in stage 4
CKD.2 Some, but not all, observational studies
identified low tCO2 as a risk factor for GFR decline
and mortality.3–7 Differences in population charac-
teristics and methodologic approaches may explain
these discrepancies. Another possibility is that
tCO2, although convenient and commonly mea-
sured in clinical practice and research settings,
may not be the best acid–base indicator of risk.
Because urine ammonium (uNH4
+) excretion is
critical for the maintenance of normal tCO2 and
reduced uNH4
+ excretion plays an important role
in the development of metabolic acidosis in CKD, it
may be an alternative and perhaps earlier indicator
of risk than tCO2. Indeed, Vallet et al. found that
lower uNH4
+ excretion was a risk factor for ESRD
in .1000 patients with CKD in the NephroTest co-
hort.8 However, they did not adjust for serum tCO2
or nutritional indicators of acid-alkali content,
such as protein intake or net endogenous acid pro-
duction (NEAP), in their main analyses. Hence, it is

 uncertain whether uNH4
+ excretion has prognostic value
above and beyond tCO2 or if the excess risk of ESRD associated
with low uNH4
+ is because of poor nutritional status. Never-
theless, this finding highlights the potential to use uNH4
+
measurements to identify at-risk individuals. This may be es-
pecially important for those with normal tCO2, who comprise
the vast majority of patients with CKD.1,2 For instance, if low
uNH4
+ were shown to be a risk factor for poor outcomes in
patients with CKD and normal tCO2, it is plausible that base
administration before acidosis ensues might prevent acidosis-
related complications in CKD. Thus, the main objective of this
study was to determine if uNH4
+ excretion is associated with
long-term clinical end points in CKD independent of serum
tCO2, NEAP, GFR, and other potential confounders. Second-
ary objectives were to determine, in the subgroup of patients
with CKD without acidosis, whether daily uNH4
+ excretion is
associated with subsequent acidosis as well as clinical events.
RESULTS
We evaluated data from participants in the African American
Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) Study.
Table 1 presents baseline characteristics of the 1044 partici-
pants included in the main analyses. Daily uNH4
+ excretion
was higher in men and those with higher body mass index
(BMI), dietary protein intake, and NEAP. Measured GFR
(mGFR) and tCO2 were higher and serum potassium was
lower in the highest uNH4
+ tertile.
As expected, uNH4
+ excretion was lower with lower mGFR
(Figure 1). Figure 2 presents unadjusted scatterplots between
uNH4
+ and mGFR, tCO2, NEAP, and protein intake. Daily
protein intake had a moderate correlation with uNH4
+,
mGFR and NEAP had low correlation with uNH4
+, and
tCO2 did not correlate with uNH4
+ in the unadjusted analyses.
Table 2 presents the adjusted multivariate linear regression
results of the association between daily uNH4
+ excretion and
key clinical factors. Sex (men), obesity, higher NEAP, higher
mGFR, higher urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, and lower
serum potassium were associated with higher uNH4
+ excre-
tion. There was no association between serum tCO2 and uNH4
+
after multivariate adjustment.
Table 3 presents the number and incidence rates of death or
ESRD events during follow-up in the entire cohort and ac-
cording to uNH4
+ tertile. The number and incidence of events
were higher with lower daily uNH4
+ excretion. Figure 3 pre-
sents the unadjusted composite outcome of death or ESRD by
tertiles of baseline daily uNH4
+ excretion. Event-free survival
was highest in the highest tertile of uNH4
+ excretion and low-
est in the lowest tertile of uNH4
+ excretion.

 excretion. Compared with the highest tertile of uNH4
+ excre-
tion, those in the lowest tertile had 46% higher risk of
the composite outcome after adjusting for the main potential
confounders (demographics, mGFR, proteinuria, NEAP,
BMI, serum potassium, and serum tCO2.) in model 1. The
results were similar after including other potential con-
founders (smoking status, systolic BP, heart disease, use of
renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, and use of diuretics) in
model 2. There was no statistically significantly different risk
of the composite outcome for those in the middle tertile com-
pared with the highest tertile of uNH4
+ excretion in model 1 or
model 2, although there was a suggestion of a dose–response
relationship. There was no evidence of effect modification by
serum bicarbonate categories (P=0.31) or tertiles of mGFR
(P=0.15), NEAP (P=0.87), or protein intake (P=0.24).
Table 5 presents the associations between daily uNH4
+ ex-
cretion and the individual outcomes of ESRD and death before
ESRD, adjusted for model 1 variables. Daily uNH4
+ excretion
had a statistically significant relationship with ESRD but not
with death before ESRD. The results were not significantly
different for either outcome after adjusting for model 2 vari-
ables (data not shown).
A sensitivity analysis that included 13 outliers who were
excluded from the main analysis (because of high uNH4
+ ex-
cretion per kilogram of body weight) showed similar hazard
ratios (HRs) for the composite outcome of death or ESRD
(HR, 1.36; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.06 to 1.75
for the lowest uNH4
+ tertile and HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.85 to
1.38 for the middle uNH4
+ tertile compared with the highest
uNH4
+ tertile, adjusted for model 1 variables). An additional
sensitivity analysis using uNH4
+ indexed to body weight in
mEq/kg per day as the independent variable showed similar
results. Those in the lowest tertile of uNH4
+ in mEq/kg per day
had higher risk of the composite outcome (HR, 1.51; 95% CI,
1.17 to 1.94) than those in the highest tertile. Compared with
those in the upper tertile of uNH4
+ in mEq/kg per day, the HR
for death or ESRD was 1.15 (95% CI, 0.90 to 1.47) for those in
the middle tertile.
Figure 4 presents the cubic spline regression model results
using median daily uNH4
+ excretion (19.5 mEq/d) as the ref-
erence point. The lowest risk of the composite outcome was
approximately 30 mEq/d uNH4
+ excretion. Below 30 mEq/d,
there was a linear and inverse association
with the composite outcome. The cubic
spline regression plot was similar after ad-
justing for model 2 variables (not shown).
Figure 5 shows the adjusted Cox model
results in which participants were catego-
rized into one of four groups according
to serum tCO2 and daily uNH4
+ excretion:
(1) tCO2,22 mEq/L and uNH4
+ excre-
tion ,20 mEq/d, (2) tCO2,22 mEq/L
and uNH4
+ excretion $20 mEq/d, (3)
tCO2$22 mEq/L and uNH4

,20 mEq/d, or (4) tCO2$22 mEq/L and
uNH4

with the reference group (tCO2$22 mEq/L
and uNH4
+ excretion $20 mEq/d), those
with uNH4
+ excretion ,20 mEq/d
and tCO2$22 mEq/L had 36% higher
risk of the composite outcome. Those
with uNH4
+ excretion $20 mEq/d and
tCO2,22 mEq/L had 30% higher risk of
the composite outcome, although statisti-
cal significance was not observed. Finally,
those with uNH4
+ excretion ,20 mEq/d and
tCO2,22 mEq/L had two-fold higher risk
of the composite outcome. The results were

 similar after adjusting for model 2 variables (data not shown).
There was no additive (relative excess risk from interaction =
0.34; 95% CI, 20.41 to 1.09; P=0.38) or multiplicative inter-
action (ratio of HRs =1.13; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.87; P=0.64) be-
tween tCO2 and uNH4
+ with the death or ESRD composite
outcome.
To evaluate the relationship between uNH4
+ and later de-
velopment of acidosis, we determined the odds of acidosis at
the 1-year follow-up visit by uNH4
+ tertile among participants
without acidosis at baseline. Of the 1044 participants in the
main analysis, 916 did not have acidosis at baseline. Of these,
866 participants had serum tCO2 measured at 1 year; 287, 282,
and 297 in the lowest, middle, and highest tertiles of uNH4
+ at
baseline, respectively. At 1 year, 87 (10%) of these participants
developed acidosis; 50 in the lowest, 22 in the middle, and 15
in the highest tertile of baseline uNH4
+. After adjusting for
randomized treatment assignment and baseline characteris-
tics, those in the lowest tertile of uNH4
+ had significantly
higher odds of acidosis than those in the highest tertile of
uNH4
+ at 1 year (Table 6).
DISCUSSION
Renal ammonia (NH3) production and consequent uNH4
+
excretion are critically important processes that help maintain
acid–base homeostasis. The decline in uNH4
+ excretion that
accompanies reduced GFR is a key contributing factor to the
development of metabolic acidosis in CKD, which is associ-
ated with poor outcomes in this population. Since reduced
uNH4
+ excretion precedes the development of metabolic ac-
idosis in this setting, measurements of uNH4
+ excretion could
be an indicator of risk, and perhaps a better indicator of risk,
than tCO2. In this study of black patients with hypertensive
CKD, we identified an association between lower daily uNH4
+
excretion and higher risk of death or ESRD independent of
demographic factors, CKD severity factors, tCO2, and nutri-
tional indicators of acid and alkali intake. The findings were
similar when uNH4
+ excretion was indexed to body weight.
Analyses of the individual outcomes found a relationship
between uNH4
+ excretion and ESRD but not mortality, per-
haps because of the greater number of ESRD events than death
before ESRD events in the AASK cohort. Our results are
consistent with those of a previous study that observed a
higher risk of ESRD with lower uNH4
+ excretion.8 Here,
we show that this relationship is independent of serum
tCO2 and nutritional determinants of acid–base status. In
addition, we show that among individuals without acidosis,
uNH4
+ excretion ,20 mEq/d is associated with higher
risk of death or ESRD (36%) than daily uNH4
+ excretion
$20 mEq/d. Finally, we have quantitated the strength of
the relationship between low uNH4
+ excretion and the risk
of subsequent acidosis for the first time. Cumulatively,
these data suggest that low daily uNH4
+ excretion has a prog-
nostic value in CKD in terms of acidosis risk, as well as long-
term clinical outcomes, irrespective of systemic tCO2 and
other factors.

 As expected, uNH4
+ directly correlated with mGFR and
inversely correlated with serum potassium after multivariate ad-
justment. Obese participants had higher uNH4
+ excretion than
nonobese participants, perhaps because of dietary factors or
higher NEAP, as did men and those with proteinuria. Although
renal acid excretion is thought to decline with aging, there was a
trendtowardhigheruNH4
+excretioninolderAASKparticipants.
Daily uNH4
+ also directly correlated with protein intake and
NEAP after multivariate adjustment. Hence, it is plausible that
the reason why low uNH4
+ is associated with poor outcomes in
CKD is because of poor nutritional status. However, we adjusted
for nutritional factors including NEAP and BMI in our analyses.
Furthermore, if low uNH4
+ were the result of low acid intake
from poor nutritional status, then it would be expected that
uNH4
+ excretion would match dietary acid intake and acid–
base balance would be relatively stable over time. However, those
in the lowest uNH4
+ tertile had .2.5-fold higher odds of subse-
quent acidosis at 1 year compared with those in the highest tertile
of uNH4
+ excretion. Hence, it is likely that participants with
low uNH4
+ had impaired renal acid excretion rather than poor
nutritional status, with consequent acid retention, higher risk of
subsequent acidosis, and poor clinical outcomes. Nevertheless,
the associations between uNH4
+ excretion and the clinical out-
comes in this cohort of black patients with hypertensive CKD
were independent of these important confounders.
The results of this study may have important implications
for research and perhaps clinical practice. Clinical practice
guidelines recommend correcting acidosis with chronic oral
alkali to prevent bone demineralization and protein catab-
olism, and results from single-center studies also suggest
that correcting acidosis may slow CKD progression.9–11
Hence, patients with CKD and acidosis are commonly pre-
scribed oral alkali. However, several lines of evidence from
animal models of CKD and observational studies in humans
suggest that alkaline therapy may be beneficial in patients
with CKD without acidosis.3,5,12 This notion is reinforced
by findings from a single-center interventional study in pa-
tients with hypertensive stage 2 CKD and mean tCO2 in the
normal range (approximately 26 mEq/L).13 In this study,
individuals who received oral sodium bicarbonate had bet-
ter renal function than a placebo group after 5 years, despite
having similar GFR at baseline. Thus, oral alkaline therapy
is a promising intervention in patients with CKD and nor-
mal tCO2. However, the vast majority of patients with
CKD have normal tCO2, and administering alkali to these
individuals may lead to overtreatment on a population
level.1,2 The results from this and the NephroTest cohort
suggest that uNH4
+ could be used to risk-stratify individu-
als with CKD without acidosis who might be more likely to
benefit from alkali. Our results suggest that an uNH4
+ ex-
cretion threshold ,20 mEq/d could be used to risk-stratify
individuals.
One of the mechanisms by which acidosis and subclinical
acidosis is thought to contribute to GFR decline in CKD is
via NH3-mediated activation of the alternative pathway of
complement, ultimately leading to tubulointerstitial fibro-
sis.14,15 Thus, it might be expected that higher uNH4
+ ex-
cretion would predict CKD progression. However, we
found an association between lower uNH4
+ excretion and
higher risk of poor outcomes, particularly as it relates to
renal function. Although these findings are seemingly con-
tradictory to the hypothesis that NH3 is a direct cause of
renal injury, it is important to note that uNH4
+ excretion
may not necessarily reflect tissue levels of NH3. For in-
stance, low uNH4
+ excretion because of impaired NH3/NH4
+
transport could lead to high interstitial concentrations of
NH3/NH4
+ and consequent intrarenal complement activa-
tion. It is more likely that low uNH4
+ excretion is simply
an indicator of poor acid excretory capacity and kidney

 function. Thus, the results of this study do not necessarily
contradict the notion that intrarenal NH3 contributes to
renal injury in CKD.
Our study has several strengths. The AASK Study has a well
characterized cohort with long-term follow-up and careful
data collection. Furthermore, .95% of randomized partici-
pants were included in the main analyses. Second, GFR was
measured by 125iodine-iothalamate clearance in the AASK
Study, which is important considering the strong relationship
between renal function and uNH4
+ excretion. Third, carefully
collected 24-hour urine samples were required before ran-
domization. Notably, the median daily uNH4
+ excretion in
the AASK cohort was 19.5 mEq, which is similar to the me-
dian daily value in the NephroTest cohort (18.5 mEq).8 Like
all observational studies, residual confounding remains pos-
sible. uNH4
+ was measured once at baseline, hence we were
not able to assess variability of uNH4
+ excretion over time in
this study. We evaluated black patients with hypertensive
CKD, hence our findings may not be generalizable to other
populations.
In summary, lower uNH4
+ excretion is a risk factor for
acidosis and poor renal and survival outcomes among blacks
with hypertensive CKD irrespective of important con-
founders, tCO2, and nutritional determinants of acid–base
status. Similar findings were observed in another CKD co-
hort.8 Hence, uNH4
+ excretion has prognostic value above
and beyond tCO2. With accumulating interest in the poten-
tial use of alkaline therapy to slow CKD progression in pa-
tients without overt acidosis, the observation that lower daily
uNH4
+ excretion in this setting signals a higher risk of death
or ESRD suggests that uNH4
+ may better risk-stratify these
individuals.
CONCISE METHODS
Study Participants
The details of the AASK Study have been published.16–18 Briefly,
black patients aged 18–70 years with hypertensive CKD (defined by
an mGFR between 20 and 65 ml/min per 1.73 m2 by renal clearance
of 125iodine-iothalamate and diastolic BP .95 mmHg) were eligi-
ble for the study. Key exclusion criteria included elevated fasting or
random blood glucose, treatment for diabetes, and urine protein-
to-creatinine ratio .2.5 g/g. Between April of 1995 and September
of 1998, 1094 participants were randomized to ramipril, meto-
prolol, or amlodipine, and to one of two BP goals (usual mean
arterial pressure goal of 102–107 mmHg or a low mean arterial
pressure goal of #92 mmHg). At the end of the randomized trial
phase, participants who did not reach ESRD were eligible to enroll
in the nonrandomized AASK Cohort Study, during which BP was
targeted to ,130/80 mmHg using ramipril or an angiotensin re-
ceptor blocker as the first-line therapy in all participants. Baseline
(prerandomization) urine samples were available for 1057

 participants. We excluded 13 participants with daily uNH4
+ ex-
cretion normalized by body wt$0.7 mEq/kg in the main analyses
out of concern for falsely elevated uNH4
+ excretion because of
bacterial overgrowth (these individuals were included in a sensi-
tivity analysis). Hence, 1044 participants were evaluated, corre-
sponding to 99% of participants with available samples and 95%
of randomized participants. The AASK Study was overseen by
institutional review boards of the participating sites and was
performed under the principles embodied in the Declaration of
Helsinki.
Measurements
Using standardized forms, trained personnel obtained data on
baseline demographic, clinical, and laboratory data. uNH4
+
was measured by the glutamate dehydrogenase method from
aliquots of the baseline 24-hour urine collection; daily uNH4
+
excretion was determined from 24-hour urine volumes. The
24-hour urine samples were confirmed to have been collected
according to the AASK Study protocol and were necessary before
randomization. Serum tCO2 was measured using either the
kinetic ultraviolet method (Roche Hitachi 747 autoanalyzer;
Roche, Indianapolis, IN) or a carbon dioxide electrode (Beckman
CX3 Delta autoanalyzer; Beckman, Brea, CA). Urine protein
excretion was expressed as protein-to-creatinine ratio from
the 24-hour urine collection. Daily dietary protein intake
(grams per day) was calculated from 24-hour urine urea nitro-
gen excretion using the following equation: 6.253[urine urea
nitrogen+(weight30.031)].19 NEAP was calculated using the
following formula: –10.2+(54.53protein intake in grams per
day)/urine potassium in mEq/d.20
Statistical Analyses
Participants were categorized by tertiles of daily uNH4
+ excretion.
Continuous variables are presented as means with SDs, unless
otherwise specified. Categorical variables are presented as percent-
ages. Significance tests were performed using analysis of variance
for continuous variables and chi-squared tests for dichotomous
variables.
Multivariate linear regression models examined the cross-
sectional relationship between daily uNH4
+ excretion and key clin-
ical features at baseline. The longitudinal outcome of interest was
the composite of death or ESRD, which were adjudicated by
the outcomes committee. A series of Cox regression models
were fit to relate the composite outcome of death or ESRD to daily
uNH4
+ excretion using the highest tertile of uNH4
+ as the refer-
ence. Follow-up time was censored at the administrative end date,
permanent loss-to-follow-up, or if the participant did not enroll in
the cohort phase. The initial model was unadjusted, followed by
adjustment for age, sex, randomized group, mGFR, proteinuria,
NEAP, serum potassium, and serum tCO2 (model 1). This model
was considered the main model because it included key demo-
graphic characteristics and biologically important potential con-
founders of the relationship between uNH4
+ and the outcomes. A
subsequent exploratory model additionally adjusted for smoking
status, systolic BP, heart disease, and use of angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics
(model 2). Similar Cox models evaluated the association between
daily uNH4
+ with death and ESRD separately. Proportional hazards
assumptions were evaluated using a formal significance test on the
basis of the unscaled and scaled Schoenfeld residuals and a graph-
ical assessment of log-log survival curves. BMI violated the pro-
portional hazards assumption and was included as a stratification
variable (,25, 25–,30, and $30 kg/m2) in the adjusted models.
Interaction of the relationship between the composite of death or
ESRD and daily uNH4
+ excretion by (1) mGFR (tertiles), (2) NEAP
(tertiles), (3) dietary protein intake (tertiles), and (4) serum tCO2
(,22, 22–28, and .28 mEq/L) was investigated by including a
multiplicative interaction term in the main model. A sensitivity
analysis included the 13 individuals who were excluded from the
main analyses. Another sensitivity analysis evaluated the hazards of
the composite ESRD or death outcome using daily uNH4
+ excretion
indexed to body weight (uNH4
+/kg per day) as the predictor variable;
the highest tertile of uNH4
+/kg per day was the reference.
Both sensitivity analyses were adjusted for variables in the main model
(model 1). A cubic spline regression analysis adjusted for the
main model variables was performed using daily uNH4
+
excretion as the predictor variable. Knots were placed at quartiles of
daily uNH4
+ excretion and the median value (19.5 mEq) was the refer-
ence point.
An additional Cox model adjusted for main model variables
was performed by grouping participants into one of four cate-
gories, according to whether daily uNH4
+ excretion was ,20 mEq
or $20 mEq and whether serum tCO2 was ,22 or $22 mEq/L.
Those with daily uNH4
+ excretion $20 mEq and serum tCO2
$22 mEq/L served as the reference. Additive interaction was
evaluated by determining the relative excess risk from interaction
with 95% CIs, and multiplicative interaction was evaluated by
determining the ratio of HRs with 95% CIs.21,22 Logistic regres-
sion analyses (adjusted for demographic factors, randomized
treatment assignment, and baseline mGFR, proteinuria, NEAP,
serum potassium, and BMI) determined the odds of acidosis
at 1 year among participants without acidosis at baseline by base-
line uNH4
+, using the highest tertile of uNH4
+ as the reference
group.
The analyses were performed using Stata 14 (StataCorp, College
Station, TX).
