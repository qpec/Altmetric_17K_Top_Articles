Abstract
Background: Approaches to controlling emerging antibiotic resistance in health care settings have evolved over time. When 
resistance to broad-spectrum antimicrobials mediated by extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) arose in the 1980s, 
targeted interventions to slow spread were not widely promoted. However, when Enterobacteriaceae with carbapenemases 
that confer resistance to carbapenem antibiotics emerged, directed control efforts were recommended. These distinct 
approaches could have resulted in differences in spread of these two pathogens. CDC evaluated these possible changes 
along with initial findings of an enhanced antibiotic resistance detection and control strategy that builds on interventions 
developed to control carbapenem resistance.
Methods: Infection data from the National Healthcare Safety Network from 2006–2015 were analyzed to calculate 
changes in the annual proportion of selected pathogens that were nonsusceptible to extended-spectrum cephalosporins 
(ESBL phenotype) or resistant to carbapenems (carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae [CRE]). Testing results for CRE 
and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA) are also reported.
Results: The percentage of ESBL phenotype Enterobacteriaceae decreased by 2% per year (risk ratio [RR] = 0.98, p<0.001); 
by comparison, the CRE percentage decreased by 15% per year (RR = 0.85, p<0.01). From January to September 2017, 
carbapenemase testing was performed for 4,442 CRE and 1,334 CRPA isolates; 32% and 1.9%, respectively, were 
carbapenemase producers. In response, 1,489 screening tests were performed to identify asymptomatic carriers; 171 
(11%) were positive.
Conclusions: The proportion of Enterobacteriaceae infections that were CRE remained lower and decreased more over 
time than the proportion that were ESBL phenotype. This difference might be explained by the more directed control 
efforts implemented to slow transmission of CRE than those applied for ESBL-producing strains. Increased detection 
and aggressive early response to emerging antibiotic resistance threats have the potential to slow further spread.
Introduction
The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance threat-
ens to outpace the development of new antimicrobials, and 
slowing the spread of these organisms has become a priority. 
Among Enterobacteriaceae, the family of pathogens most 
frequently associated with health care–associated infec-
tions (1), resistance to the broad-spectrum antimicrobials 
extended-spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenems has been 
driven largely by the spread of plasmid-mediated resistance 
genes encoding extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) 
and carbapenemases, respectively. In the United States, 
ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were first reported in 
1988 (2). The emergence of these ESBL-producing isolates 
limited the options available for treatment, but these organisms 
remained susceptible to some first-line therapies, including 
carbapenems. In general, facilities independently selected 
approaches to control spread, which often included core 
infection control practices, such as hand hygiene, and placing 
patients with ESBL-producing strains in single rooms under 
Contact Precautions.
Enterobacteriaceae resistance to even broader spectrum 
antimicrobials, including carbapenems, was reported with 
increasing frequency beginning in 2001 (3). Rapid spread of 
these carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) in parts 
of the United States and other countries (4,5) highlighted a 
need to more aggressively control CRE transmission. In 2009, 
CDC created CRE-specific guidance, which was endorsed 
by the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory 
 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report

Committee (6). This guidance included recommendations 
for additional interventions when CRE was identified at a 
health care facility, including laboratory surveillance of clinical 
cultures and targeted patient screening to identify health care 
contacts with asymptomatic colonization. This CRE-specific 
guidance was updated in 2013 and 2015 (https://www.cdc.gov/
hai/organisms/cre/cre-toolkit/index.html) and was highlighted 
by CDC in a 2013 report (7).
In 2017, CDC outlined a new effort to react rapidly to novel 
multidrug-resistant organisms (8); this approach includes 
encouraging health care facilities and public health authorities 
to respond to single isolates of an emerging antibiotic-resistant 
pathogen. The strategy rests on these five pillars: 1) rapid detec-
tion of targeted pathogens and their resistance mechanisms, 
2) on-site infection control assessments by trained experts to 
identify gaps in infection prevention, 3) screening of exposed 
contacts to identify asymptomatic colonization, 4) coordina-
tion of the response among facilities, and 5) continuing these 
interventions until transmission is controlled. Detection and 
control efforts can extend from the index facility to other 
facilities that share patients.
To support this approach, CDC established the Antibiotic 
Resistance Laboratory Network (ARLN) (https://www.cdc.
gov/drugresistance/solutions-initiative/ar-lab-networks.html) 
to improve national capacity to rapidly detect and respond to 
antibiotic resistance. ARLN provides carbapenemase testing 
for two emerging antibiotic resistant pathogens, CRE and 
carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA), at 
56 state and local public health laboratories and screening for 
asymptomatic CRE and CRPA carriage at seven regional labo-
ratories (9). Carbapenemase-producing strains were targeted 
for detection and response in part because of their previously 
demonstrated propensity for spread. CDC also expanded fund-
ing to state and local health departments to increase capacity 
and build expertise in responding to these and other emerging 
antibiotic resistance threats.
For this report, data from a national health care–associated 
infections surveillance system were reviewed to determine if 
the more directed approach applied for CRE was associated 
with differences in the percentage of Enterobacteriacae health 
care–associated infections that were CRE compared with those 
that had the ESBL phenotype. In addition, findings from the 
first 9 months of the enhanced response to emerging resistant 
organisms are described.
Methods
Percentage of Enterobacteriaceae with CRE or ESBL phe-
notypes in the National Healthcare Safety Network, 2006–
2015. Included in the analysis were central line–associated 
bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) and catheter-associated 
urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) associated with Escherichia 
coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae and reported to CDC’s National 
Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) during 2006–2015 from 
adult medical, surgical, or medical/surgical intensive care units 
at short-stay acute care hospitals. The Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services’ (CMS) Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting 
Program mandated reporting of CLABSI and CAUTI data to 
NHSN starting in 2011 and 2012, respectively; data from previ-
ous years represent voluntary reporting or reporting to comply 
with state or local mandates. National pooled mean percentages 
for Enterobacteriaceae with CRE phenotype (isolates resistant 
to imipenem, meropenem, doripenem, or ertapenem), and 
ESBL phenotype (isolates that tested intermediate or susceptible 
to carbapenems and intermediate or resistant to ceftazidime, 
cefepime, ceftriaxone, or cefotaxime) were calculated. Log bino-
mial regression models were used to estimate the average annual 
change in the proportion of E. coli and K. pneumoniae that had 
a CRE or ESBL phenotype. P-values <0.05 were considered 
statistically significant. Sensitivity analyses were performed to 
account for the change in hospitals reporting to NHSN each 
year. The results of the log binomial regression model were 
confirmed by a robust variance Poisson model.
Enhanced detection and response. CRE and CRPA 
(P
. aeruginosa resistant to imipenem, meropenem, or doripe-
nem) isolates were submitted to ARLN laboratories for test-
ing for carbapenemases. Among Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, 
K. oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, and Enterobacter spp. were targeted 
for submission. Testing at ARLN laboratories included car-
bapenemase production testing and molecular detection of 
genes encoding for the five carbapenemases of primary public 
health concern: Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), 
New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM), Verona integron 
encoded metallo-beta-lactamase (VIM), imipenemase (IMP), 
and oxacillinase-48-like carbapenemase (OXA-48). ARLN 
laboratories were asked to report positive findings to local 
public health authorities and CDC within 1 day and to submit 
testing summaries to CDC monthly.
For each carbapenemase-producing isolate detected, CDC 
guidance recommends that state health department staff 
members contact the health care facility to review infection 
control measures and consider performing on-site infection 
control assessments. If indicated, contacts of the index patient 
are screened to detect transmission; testing capacity for this 
screening is provided through ARLN. Response activities con-
tinue until transmission is controlled. Screening results were 
stratified by whether the screening took place in a short-stay 
acute care hospital or a post–acute care facility (i.e., long-term 
acute care hospital or nursing home).

Results
Percentage of Enterobacteriaceae with CRE or ESBL phe-
notypes in the National Healthcare Safety Network, 2006–
2015. Among short-stay acute care hospitals, the percentage of 
Klebsiella and E. coli isolates with the ESBL phenotype remained 
relatively stable, ranging from 17.6% (116 of 659 isolates) in 
2006 to 16.5% (694 of 4,211) in 2015, with a peak of 18.9% 
in 2009 (Figure 1). The percentage of CRE declined from 8.8% 
(35 of 397 isolates) in 2006 and 10.6% (64 of 604) in 2007 to 
3.1% (115 of 3,718) in 2015 (Figure 2). During 2006–2015, 
the annual percentage of isolates with the ESBL phenotype 
declined an average of 2% (RR = 0.98, p = 0.009); during the 
same period, the proportion that were CRE decreased 15% per 
year (RR = 0.85, p<0.001). Results were unchanged when the 
analysis was limited to facilities that reported in all years.
Enhanced detection of and response to carbapenemase-
producing organisms. During the first 9 months of 2017, 
among 4,442 CRE and 1,334 CRPA isolates that were tested 
for carbapenemases from 32 states, 1,401 (32%) CRE and 
25 (1.9%) CRPA were carbapenemase producers (Table 1). 
Among the carbapenemase-producing isolates, 221 (15.5%) 
expressed carbapenemases other than KPC. Of isolates tested, 
1,422 (25%) were collected in the first quarter of 2017, 
2,141 (37%) in the second quarter, and 2,213 (38%) in 
the third quarter. During this period, the median time from 
specimen collection to CDC notification decreased from 37 to

13 days. The percentage of carbapenemase-producing isolates 
varied by organism and was highest among Klebsiella species 
(65%). Among carbapenemase-producing CRE, the most 
commonly identified carbapenemase was KPC (1,232 of 1,401 
isolates, 88%); VIM was the most common carbapenemase 
identified in CRPA (18 of 25, 72%) (Table 1).
To identify asymptomatically colonized health care contacts 
of index patients, 1,489 screening tests for carbapenemases 
were performed during 70 surveys (defined as all screening 
tests performed at a single facility within a 14-day period) 
in 50 facilities. A median of 10.5 contacts (interquartile 
range = 2–25) were screened per survey. Overall, 11% of 
screening tests were positive for at least one of the five carbapen-
emases of primary public health concern (Table 2). A higher 
percentage of post–acute care facility contacts screened positive 
for carbapenemases (14% [147 of 1,074 contacts]) than did 
contacts from short-stay acute care hospitals (5.8% [21 of 365]) 
(p<0.01). Screening tests performed increased from 363 in the 
first quarter of 2017, to 732 in the third.
Illustrative examples. Public health responses using 
this new approach have identified single cases without 
transmission, transmission within facilities, and spread to 
multiple facilities. Examples from two states are presented to 
illustrate these efforts.
In October 2017, the Tennessee Department of Health con-
tacted CDC regarding identification of an NDM and OXA-
48–producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate through ARLN.

Infection control assessment and screening of hospital contacts 
was completed and results returned within 48 hours of identifica-
tion of carbapenemase presence. No transmission was identified. 
Because the index patient had a recent health care exposure in 
another country, ARLN regional laboratories expanded their 
services to perform CDC-recommended admission screening for 
patients with a history of overnight health care stays outside the 
United States during the preceding 6 months (10).
In April 2017, the Iowa Department of Public Health contacted 
CDC regarding IMP identified in a Proteus species isolated from 
a nursing home resident. The state health department assessed 
infection control practices and performed a point prevalence sur-
vey that identified five additional colonized residents among 30 
surveyed at the nursing home. The health department conducted 
additional infection control assessments to ensure adherence to 
recommended practices and two follow-up surveys of the nursing 
home wing, which did not identify any additional cases.
Conclusions and Comments
Although the proportion of Klebsiella spp. and E. coli that 
had either an ESBL or CRE phenotype both declined during 
2006–2015, larger decreases and a lower overall percent resis-
tant were observed for the CRE phenotype. This difference 
might be attributable, at least in part, to the more directed 
response employed to slow the spread of CRE once it was 
identified. Although CDC’s containment approach had not 
yet been fully initiated when the decline in CRE began, these 
data suggest that an early aggressive response, as outlined in 
CRE-specific infection prevention recommendations released 
beginning in 2009 (6), can slow emergence and even decrease 
the occurrence of infections from resistant pathogens. As 
laboratory capacity improved, ARLN testing volume and 
public health responses increased over the first three quarters 
of 2017, demonstrating that recent investments in detection 
and response capacity are facilitating prompt identification 
of and response to emerging resistant organisms. Notably, 
221 isolates with non-KPC carbapenemases were identified; 
these rare forms of resistance have the potential to add to the 
U.S. CRE burden and represent an important opportunity 
to prevent the spread of novel resistance at its earliest stage. 
Findings from these enhanced prevention efforts are being used 
to further refine detection and prevention strategies.
Contact screening identified previously undetected transmission 
and appeared to have the highest yield in post–acute care facilities 
with higher acuity patients. Challenges in these settings that might 
facilitate transmission of resistant organisms include long duration 
of facility stay, less aggressive use of transmission-based precautions 
because of concerns about resident quality of life, high staff turnover 
rates, and less expertise and training in infection control. Previous 
work has also identified these settings as potential amplifiers of 
CRE transmission (11), underscoring the importance of providing 
ongoing support to these facilities when targeted resistant organisms 
are identified. This support includes infection control assessments 
to improve adherence to recommended interventions and screening 
of contacts to identify asymptomatic carriers.
Although this analysis focused on carbapenemase-producing 
organisms, the containment strategy can prevent the spread of 
other emerging antimicrobial resistant pathogens, including 
Candida auris and pan-resistant bacteria. Using existing sur-
veillance systems, including ARLN, further work is under way 
to better identify and understand new threats, including those 
that are emerging outside the United States. CDC continues to 
work to develop tests for new resistance mechanisms that can 
be made available via ARLN. Resistance is constantly evolving, 
and the containment strategy and ARLN are designed to be 
flexible and nimble to rapidly detect and respond to new threats.

Despite improvements in capacity to detect carbapenemases 
in clinical isolates and asymptomatic carriers through ARLN, 
challenges remain. Transmission in one facility in a region 
has the potential to affect all of the facilities and patients in a 
region through patient sharing; therefore, recognition by health 
care facilities of the importance of an aggressive, early, and 
coordinated response is needed to ensure responses are timely 
and comprehensive. Mathematic modeling of the containment 
strategy based on a single U.S. state’s patient transfer network 
suggests that an intervention resulting in a 20% reduction 
in transmission would result in approximately 1,600 fewer 
clinical cases, a relative reduction of about 76%, 3 years after 
introduction (CDC, unpublished data, 2018). In addition, 
commitment from health care personnel and health care facili-
ties to improve adherence to infection control interventions 
that can prevent transmission, especially in post–acute care 
settings, is necessary to prevent amplification of emerging resis-
tance. For situations in which a targeted form of antimicrobial 
resistance has emerged more widely in a region, containment 
strategies might be less effective; additional work is required 
for these situations to identify the optimal strategies to reduce 
the prevalence of endemic resistant organisms. Finally, current 
interventions are challenging to implement and sustain; new 
interventions to reduce transmission are needed to supplement 
currently available prevention measures.
Public health departments, because of their expertise and 
ability to work across health care facilities, are uniquely posi-
tioned to facilitate these responses to emerging antimicrobial 
resistance. Since 2009, CDC has provided resources to develop 
state and local health care–associated infection programs; cur-
rently, CDC supports approximately 500 persons in state and 
local health departments to work on health care-associated 
infections and antimicrobial resistance. Details on funding 
provided to each state to combat antimicrobial resistance are 
provided in CDC’s antimicrobial resistance map (https://
wwwn.cdc.gov/arinvestments).
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita-
tions. First, resistance data in NHSN are collected using the 
final interpretations of resistant, intermediate, or sensitive, and 
this analysis does not account for differences among laborato-
ries in the breakpoints used for interpretation or for changes 
in breakpoints over time. Enterobacteriaceae breakpoints for 
carbapenems and some cephalosporins were lowered during 
the analysis period. This might have resulted in an increase in 
isolates reported as resistant in later years of this analysis and 
could have resulted in an underestimation of any reductions in 
CRE or ESBLs described. Second, NHSN data analyzed for this 
report represent only isolates from two infection types (CAUTI 
and CLABSI); changes in colonization or other infection types 
would not be identified. Third, although greater reductions were 
seen in the percentage of organisms that were CRE compared 
to those with the ESBL phenotype, this analysis is unable to 
identify the exact cause for this difference. Finally, some states 
and health care facilities with colonization testing capacity chose 
to perform screening in-house rather than through the ARLN 
regional laboratory; these tests are not reported to ARLN and 
therefore are not included in this report, resulting in an under-
estimation of the true volume of screening conducted.
Limiting the spread of emerging forms of antibiotic resistance is 
a public health priority, and a timely and coordinated effort among 
health care facilities, local and state health departments, and CDC 
is needed to accomplish this goal. Research is already under way to 
expand control strategies through innovative approaches such as 
patient decolonization and microbiome manipulation, along with 
a focus on identifying strategies to decrease the time from specimen 
collection to public health response. Fortunately, with the parallel 
development of an enhanced prevention strategy for emerging 
antimicrobial resistance and implementation of advanced labora-
tory testing in ARLN, the critical tools for controlling the spread 
of antimicrobial resistance are now available nationwide. In the 
first year of ARLN implementation, CDC and state and local 
public health departments and public health laboratory partners

Key Points
• The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance 
threatens to outpace the development of new antibiotics. 
Slowing the spread of emerging resistance is a CDC 
priority to protect persons and help slow the development 
of antibiotic resistance overall. 
• Infection data from the National Healthcare Safety 
Network from 2006-2015 were analyzed to calculate 
changes in the annual proportion of selected 
pathogens that were nonsusceptible to extended-
spectrum cephalosporins (ESBL phenotype) or 
resistant to carbapenems (carbapenem-resistant 
Enterobacteriaceae [CRE]). 
• The percentage of ESBL phenotype Enterobacteriaceae 
decreased by 2% per year; by comparison, the CRE 
percentage decreased by 15% per year. 
• The proportion of Enterobacteriaceae infections that 
were CRE remained lower and decreased more over 
time than the proportion that were ESBL phenotype. 
This difference might be explained by the more directed 
control efforts implemented to slow transmission of 
CRE than those applied for ESBL-producing strains.
• These data suggest that an early aggressive response, as 
outlined in CRE-specific infection prevention 
recommendations released beginning in 2009, can slow 
emergence and even decrease the occurrence of 
infections from resistant pathogens.
• In 2017, CDC outlined a new effort to react rapidly to 
novel multidrug-resistant organisms; this approach 
includes encouraging health care facilities and public 
health authorities to respond to even single isolates of 
an emerging antibiotic-resistant pathogen. 
• From January to September 2017, carbapenemase 
testing was performed by the Antibiotic Resistance 
Lab Network for 4,442 CRE and 1,334 carbapenem-
resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA) isolates; 32% 
and 1.9%, respectively were carbapenemase-producers. 
Among the carbapenemase-producing isolates, 221 
(15.5%) expressed carbapenemases other than Klebsiella 
pneumoniae carbapenemase.  Carbapenemases can 
make germs resistant to some of our most powerful 
drugs, carbapenems.

have effectively increased the capacity to identify and respond 
to high concern organisms to prevent transmission of resistant 
pathogens. Although some challenges remain, this national public 
health strategy represents a critical step in the effort to decrease 
the impact of resistant pathogens.
