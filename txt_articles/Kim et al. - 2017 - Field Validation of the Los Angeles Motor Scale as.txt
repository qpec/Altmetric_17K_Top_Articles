ecent advances in stroke research have confirmed that 
time is brain,1 and early therapeutic intervention is cru-
cial to improve outcome in acute cerebrovascular disease 
(ACVD), including both ischemic stroke and intracerebral 
hemorrhage.2–6 As a result, randomized trials are increas-
ingly studying the initiation of acute stroke therapies in the 
prehospital setting.7–9 For these studies, neurological deficit 
status in the field, prior to start of the experimental therapy, 
is a crucial baseline measure to enable interpretation of trial 
results. In addition, prehospital care systems are playing an 
increasing role in care of acute stroke transports,10 includ-
ing (1) prearrival notification,11 (2) tiered routing to Primary 
Background and Purpose—The Los Angeles Motor Scale (LAMS) is a 3-item, 0- to 10-point motor stroke-deficit scale 
developed for prehospital use. We assessed the convergent, divergent, and predictive validity of the LAMS when 
performed by paramedics in the field at multiple sites in a large and diverse geographic region.
Methods—We analyzed early assessment and outcome data prospectively gathered in the FAST-MAG trial (Field 
Administration of Stroke Therapy–Magnesium phase 3) among patients with acute cerebrovascular disease (cerebral 
ischemia and intracranial hemorrhage) within 2 hours of onset, transported by 315 ambulances to 60 receiving hospitals.
Results—Among 1632 acute cerebrovascular disease patients (age 70±13 years, male 57.5%), time from onset to prehospital 
LAMS was median 30 minutes (interquartile range 20–50), onset to early postarrival (EPA) LAMS was 145 minutes 
(interquartile range 119–180), and onset to EPA National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 150 minutes (interquartile 
range 120–180). Between the prehospital and EPA assessments, LAMS scores were stable in 40.5%, improved in 37.6%, 
and worsened in 21.9%. In tests of convergent validity, against the EPA National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, 
correlations were r=0.49 for the prehospital LAMS and r=0.89 for the EPA LAMS. Prehospital LAMS scores did diverge 
from the prehospital Glasgow Coma Scale, r=−0.22. Predictive accuracy (adjusted C statistics) for nondisabled 3-month 
outcome was as follows: prehospital LAMS, 0.76 (95% confidence interval 0.74–0.78); EPA LAMS, 0.85 (95% confidence 
interval 0.83–0.87); and EPA National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, 0.87 (95% confidence interval 0.85–0.88).
Conclusions—In this multicenter, prospective, prehospital study, the LAMS showed good to excellent convergent, divergent, 
and predictive validity, further establishing it as a validated instrument to characterize stroke severity in the field.

 Kim et al  Field Validation of the LAMS   299
and Comprehensive Stroke Centers,12,13 and (3) initiation of 
experimental treatment interventions in the field.9 For each of 
these applications, it is desirable that prehospital personnels 
use tools that enable identification of likely stroke patients 
and grade stroke-deficit severity. Prehospital stroke severity 
assessment scales enable prearrival alerting of receiving hos-
pitals to patient severity and preferential routing of likely large 
vessel occlusion patients directly to Comprehensive Stroke 
Centers.
The Los Angeles Motor Scale (LAMS) is a 3-item, 0- to 
10-point motor stroke-deficit scale developed for prehospital 
and emergency department (ED) use.14 A preliminary study 
showed good concurrent, discriminant, and predictive validity 
of the LAMS scores, but had limitations of being performed at 
a single site and using examination findings by physicians at 
hospital entry rather than prehospital personnel in the field.14,15 
The present study, therefore, prospectively assessed the per-
formance characteristics of the LAMS performed in the field 
by paramedics at multiple sites in a large and diverse geo-
graphic region.
Methods
We analyzed data prospectively gathered in the FAST-MAG phase 
3, randomized trial (Field Administration of Stroke Therapy–
Magnesium), which studied prehospital initiation of magnesium ver-
sus placebo for likely stroke patients presenting within 2 hours from 
last known well time.9 The detailed methods of the FAST-MAG trial 
have been previously published.16,17 Patients with likely stroke, indi-
cated by a positive Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen, and within 
2 hours of last known well time were enrolled in the trial. Paramedics 
performed the LAMS at time of enrollment in the field in all patients 
(Table I in the online-only Data Supplement).
The trial was conducted in Los Angeles and Orange Counties 
from 2004 to 2012. Training in study procedures, including perfor-
mance of the Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen/LAMS, was 
provided to 2988 paramedics staffing 315 participating ambulances 
from 40 Emergency Medical Services provider agencies, trans-
porting patients to 60 receiving hospitals. In addition to perform-
ing the LAMS prior to study entry, paramedics also performed the 
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), as per standing Emergency Medical 
Services policy. After hospital arrival, study research coordinators 
performed the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) 
and concurrently performed a repeat LAMS and GCS assessment. 
Determinations of final outcome at poststroke day 90 included 
assessments of global disability (modified Rankin Scale, mRS), 
instrumental activities of daily living (Barthel Index), global func-
tional outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale), and neurological deficit 
(NIHSS).
Validity Testing
To assess convergent validity of the LAMS, LAMS scores were 
compared with the reference standard of NIHSS scores. Because the 
NIHSS was performed only after hospital arrival, concurrent validity 
was assessed in 2 ways. First, we compared the scores of the study 
coordinator–performed, early postarrival (EPA) assessment LAMS 
with the simultaneous, study coordinator–performed, EPA assess-
ment NIHSS. This comparison provides the best formal assessment of 
scale concurrent validity, but reflects LAMS administration by study 
coordinators in the ED rather than paramedics in the field. Second, we 
compared the scores of the paramedic-performed, prehospital LAMS 
with those of the study coordinator–performed, EPA assessment 
NIHSS. This comparison reflects actual ecologically valid use of the 
LAMS scale, but will have noise introduced by patient improvement 
or worsening that occurs between the time of prehospital assessment 
and the EPA assessment.
To investigate divergent validity, the prehospital LAMS was com-
pared with the prehospital GCS performed concurrently. Because 
the LAMS is intended to measure focal stroke deficits, it should not 
closely correlate with the GCS, which measures level of conscious-
ness. Also, because the GCS is already widely performed by pre-
hospital personnel, the LAMS would be of value only if it provided 
additional information distinct from that of the GCS.
For predictive validity, we analyzed the association of the prehos-
pital LAMS and other early initial assessments (prehospital GCS, 
EPA LAMS, EPA GCS, and EPA NIHSS) with the 90-day outcomes 
(mRS, Barthel Index, Glasgow Outcome Scale, NIHSS, and mortal-
ity). These associations were characterized in 4 ways. First, the asso-
ciation of initial assessment scores with the full range of each 3-month 
outcome scale was quantified using correlation coefficients. Second, 
the association of initial assessment scores with dichotomized 90-day 
outcomes was computed using receiver operating curves to calcu-
late the C statistic. Dichotomized 90-day outcomes analyzed were 
excellent outcome (mRS score 0–1), good outcome (mRS score 0–2), 
and mortality. Third, for the cut points on the initial assessments that 
maximized predictive accuracy, we calculated sensitivity, specificity, 
and overall accuracy in predicting 90-day dichotomized outcomes. 
Finally, logistic regression was used to assess the degree to which 
the initial assessment scores independently contributed to dichoto-
mized 90-day outcomes. In addition, we analyzed whether prehospi-
tal LAMS scores predicted intensity of initial treatment as indexed by 
use of tissue-type plasminogen activator.
Statistical Analysis
For the description of the general characteristics of the study popula-
tion, percentages are reported for categorical variables, means, and 
standard deviations for parametric variables and medians and inter-
quartile ranges (IQRs) for nonparametric variables. The Pearson χ2 
test, Student t test, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, as appropriate, were 
used to compare variables between patients with dichotomized out-
comes of interest. The nonparametric Spearman coefficient was used 
because the data are ordinal rather than continuous. Strength of cor-
relation was categorized as follows: 0 to 0.19, very weak; 0.2 to 0.39, 
weak; 0.40 to 0.59, moderate; 0.6 to 0.79, strong; and 0.8 to 1, very 
strong.18
Adjusted outcome models were developed for 3 patient groups 
according to final diagnosis of the qualifying event: (1) ACVD (com-
posite of acute cerebral ischemia [ACI] and intracranial hemorrhage 
[ICrH]), (2) ACI, and (3) ICrH. All 3 outcome models included 5 pre-
specified variables, based on prior literature and clinical judgment: 
age, prestroke mRS, prior stroke, diabetes mellitus, and atrial fibril-
lation. Each model also included variables associated with outcomes 
with P<0.10 in univariate analysis, for the model’s particular diag-
nostic category (Methods in the online-only Data Supplement). For C 
statistics, predictive accuracy was considered poor for values of 0.5 to 
0.69, moderate for 0.7 to 0.79, and strong for 0.8 to 1.0.19 Calibration 
of analytic models for prediction of functional outcomes was per-
formed by Hosmer–Lemeshow test. Odds ratios and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) were calculated. A P value of <0.05 was considered to 
be statistically significant.
Results
General Characteristics
The demographic and clinical features of the study popula-
tion are shown in Table II in the online-only Data Supplement. 
Among the 1632 patients with ACVD, mean age was 69.6 
years; 57.5% were male; 1245 (76.3%) had ACI; and 387 
(23.7%) had ICrH. Among the ACVD patients, the time from 
onset (last known well) to prehospital LAMS was median 30 
minutes (IQR 20–50), onset to EPA LAMS was 145 minutes 
(IQR 119–180), and onset to EPA NIHSS was 150 minutes 
(IQR 120–180). The median score of the prehospital LAMS

was 4 (IQR 3–5), the EPA LAMS was 4 (IQR 2–4), and EPA 
NIHSS was 9 (IQR 3–18). Between the time of prehospital 
and EPA evaluation, LAMS scores remained the same in 
40.5% of patients, improved in 37.6% of patients, and wors-
ened in 21.9% of patients.
Convergent Validity
The EPA LAMS correlated very strongly with the concur-
rently performed EPA NIHSS in ACI patients (r=0.89), ICrH 
patients (r=0.81), and all ACVD patients (r=0.89; Figure 1). 
The prehospital LAMS scores moderately correlated with 
both the EPA LAMS (r=0.46) and EPA NIHSS scores (r=0.49; 
Table 1; Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement).
Divergent Validity
Correlations between the LAMS and the GCS were very weak 
or weak when concurrently performed in the field in ACI 
patients (r=−0.27), ICrH patients (r=−0.09), and all ACVD 
patients (r=−0.22), but weak or moderate when concurrently 
performed EPA (Table 1).
Predictive Validity
Correlations among functional outcome scales at 3 months 
and early deficit severity scales are shown in Table III in the 
online-only Data Supplement. Although the EPA LAMS corre-
lated moderately with 3-month mRS disability scores, r=0.55, 
the association of prehospital LAMS with 3-month mRS was 
less strong, r=0.34. The correlation of the EPA LAMS and 
the concurrent EPA NIHSS with 3-month mRS were similar 
(r=0.55 and 0.62, respectively). The distributions of mRS 
outcomes at 3 months across all levels of disability that were 
associated with initial scores on the prehospital LAMS and the 
EPA LAMS are shown in Figure 2 and Supplemental Figure 
II in the online-only Data Supplement. Each incrementally 
higher score on the LAMS was associated with a shift to more 
severe disability distribution at 3 months.
Prehospital LAMS scores were substantially lower in 
patients with better than worse 3-month outcomes (Table IV 
in the online-only Data Supplement). In multivariate analy-
sis, every 1 point increase in the prehospital LAMS score was 
associated substantially reduced odds of freedom from disabil-
ity (adjusted odds ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.52–0.63; P<0.0001), 
functional independence (odds ratio 0.52, 95% CI 0.47–0.57; 
P<0.0001), and survival (odds ratio 0.59, 95% CI 0.52–0.67; 
P<0.0001) at 3 months (Table 2).
The overall predictive accuracy of prehospital and EPA 
stroke severity scales for dichotomized outcomes at 3 months 
are shown in Table 3. Predictive accuracies were comparably 
strong for the concurrently performed EPA LAMS and EPA 
NIHSS, both exceeding the moderate performance of the 
concurrently performed EPA GCS. For example, among all 
ACVD patients, in adjusted analysis, the predictive accuracy 
for excellent 3-month functional outcome for the EPA LAMS 
was 0.85 (95% CI 0.83–0.87) and for the EPA NIHSS was 
0.87 (95% CI 0.85–0.88), both higher than that of the EPA 
GCS of 0.74 (95% CI 0.72–0.77). The prehospital LAMS 
had less robust predictive accuracy than the EPA LAMS and 
NIHSS, but still performed moderately or strongly and bet-
ter than the simultaneously performed prehospital GCS. For 
example, among all ACVD patients, the predictive accuracy 
for excellent 3-month functional outcome of the prehospital 
LAMS (adjusted C statistic) was 0.76 (95% CI 0.74–0.78) 
versus 0.69 for GCS (95% CI 0.66–0.72).
A similar pattern was seen when considering sensitivity, 
specificity, and overall accuracy of dichotomized versions of 
the early severity scales in predicting 3-month outcomes. The 
concurrently performed EPA LAMS and EPA NIHSS showed 
comparable accuracy, superior to the concurrent EPA GCS; 
the prehospital LAMS had lesser but still moderate accuracy 
(Table V in the online-only Data Supplement). For example, 
among all ACVD patients, an EPA LAMS score of <3 had 
73.8% accuracy in predicting final excellent functional out-
come and an EPA NIHSS score of <10 had 74.2% accuracy, 
while a prehospital LAMS score <3 had 65.1% accuracy. In 
contrast, in assessing goodness of fit, the prehospital LAMS 
showed better calibration than the EPA LAMS or the EPA 
NIHSS (Table VI in the online-only Data Supplement).
The prehospital LAMS score also predicted intensity of 
postarrival treatment. Among ACI patients, higher LAMS 
scores in the field were strongly associated with receiving ver-
sus not receiving intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activa-
tor after arrival, 5 (IQR 3–5) versus 3 (IQR 2–5), respectively, 
P<0.0001.
Discussion
This study provides validation of the LAMS as a tool for 
paramedic assessment of the degree of stroke severity. The 
LAMS showed convergent validity with the current gold stan-
dard assessment, the NIHSS. Correlation with the NIHSS was

excellent when both tests were performed simultaneously, 
early after hospital arrival, and moderate when the LAMS 
was performed in the field, a median of 120 minutes before 
the postarrival NIHSS. The LAMS also demonstrated diver-
gent validity, showing weaker correlation with the GCS, a test 
of level of consciousness rather than stroke-deficit severity. 
The LAMS displayed predictive validity, forecasting 3-month 
functional outcomes better than simultaneously performed 
GCS and comparably to simultaneously performed NIHSS. 
The good performance of the LAMS was observed among all 
ACVD patients and within the 2 major subtypes of ACI and 
acute ICrH.
A notable finding of the current study is that the LAMS per-
formed in the prehospital setting predicted 3-month outcomes 
less well than the LAMS performed early after hospital arrival. 
This difference most likely reflects the greater fluctuations in 
subsequent course that occur in the hyperacute period versus 
later after stroke onset, rather than inaccurate prehospital eval-
uations. The very early period after stroke onset is known to be 
associated with more frequent fluctuations in clinical course 
than later periods, with frequent worsening occurring in ICrH 
patients and both improvement and worsening occurring in 
ACI patients.20–23 In the 2 National Institute of Neurological 
Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)–tissue-type plasminogen acti-
vator trials, among placebo patients, later NIHSS assessments 
correlated with final outcome progressively strongly compared 
with earlier assessments.22 Among placebo patients, between 
1 to 3 hours and 24 hours, substantial (≥4 point) improvement 
or worsening occurred in fully 57% of patients. In the present 
study, the first severity evaluation was performed even earlier 
than in the NINDS–tissue-type plasminogen activator trials. 
The prehospital evaluation was performed only 30 minutes 
after onset, 2 hours earlier than the postarrival evaluation. The 
greater frequency of deficit fluctuation early after stroke onset 
has fundamental implications for design of prehospital clini-
cal trials. The snapshot in time in the ambulance is inherently 
less predictive of outcome than the later snapshot in time after 
hospital arrival. Consequently, all prehospital stroke severity

scales will be less predictive of final outcome than the same 
or more extensive scales performed after hospital arrival. 
Nonetheless, in this study, the prehospital LAMS had substan-
tial predictive validity, independently contributing to outcome 
determination after adjustment for all other variables.
This study substantially expands the evidence for the LAMS 
as a validated prehospital stroke assessment14 by demonstrating 
validity in a large and diverse patient population, prospectively 
assessed by many different paramedic providers. This study is 
the largest prehospital validation of a prehospital stroke sever-
ity instrument of which we are aware. Some other tools have 
been derived from ED examinations by physicians and pro-
posed for prehospital use, but not yet tested in the field.24–26 
The Rapid Arterial Occlusion Evaluation has been tested in 
the field, but was designed with the more narrow purpose of 
identifying large vessel occlusion patients and has not had its 
general convergent, divergent, and outcome-predictive validity 
evaluated.27 The findings of this study are consonant with stud-
ies evaluating the Kurashiki prehospital stroke scale (KPSS), 
which was tested in the field in a smaller sample of 256 patients 
with ACVD. Among hyperacute cerebral ischemia patients, the 
KPSS correlation with the NIHSS (r=0.71) was intermediate 
with that observed in this study (prehospital r=0.49, simultane-
ous r=0.89), consistent with the shorter between-examination 
delay in the KPSS study than in the current study.28 The predic-
tive validity of the KPSS for nondisabled outcome (mRS score 
0–1) at 3 months was comparable with that observed for the 
LAMS in the current study, considering that the KPSS exams 
were performed after symptom onset later than the LAMS.29 
These findings suggest comparable validity of the more com-
plex KPSS and the simpler LAMS.
Our study found that, when performed at the same time 
as the NIHSS, the LAMS predicts final functional outcome 
equally well. For nondisabled (mRS score 0–1) outcome at 
3 months, the predictive accuracy of the postarrival LAMS 
was statistically equivalent to that of the NIHSS. This result 
is consonant with a previous, smaller study.14 That the sim-
pler, 3-item LAMS, assessing only motor deficits, has equal 
predictive validity to the more extensive, 13-item NIHSS, 
assessing multiple functional domains, should not be surpris-
ing. Motor deficits are a key determinant of functional out-
come poststroke,30,31 and among acute stroke patients, there

is substantial correlation between degree of motor deficit 
and degree of deficits in visual, cognitive, sensory, and other 
domains.32 The NIHSS certainly has greater content breadth 
than the LAMS, but is too unwieldy and time-consuming in 
the field, whereas the LAMS can be performed in just 20 to 30 
seconds. In addition, the excellent concurrent validity of the 
LAMS and the NIHSS suggests that the LAMS, with greater 
simplicity and rapidity, because it could be automatically 
derived from the Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen,14 
can be a good substitute of the NIHSS to assess initial stroke 
severity in the field.
Among all ACVD patients, the LAMS performed well in 
predicting the full spectrum of 3-month clinical outcomes 
across the domains of disability (mRS), activities of daily liv-
ing (Barthel Index), impairment (NIHSS), and vital status. For 
3-month mRS disability, good performance of the LAMS was 
noted for predicting outcomes across the full ordinal spec-
trum, as well as for the most commonly demarcated binary 
cut points of freedom from disability (mRS score 0–1), func-
tional independence (mRS score 0–2), and survival (mRS 
score 0–5). The LAMS also performed well within each of the 
2 major stroke subtypes. For ACI, it correlated with 3-month 
outcomes equally well as the subtype-specific gold standard 
for deficit severity assessment, the NIHSS. For ICrH, it cor-
related with 3-month outcomes as well or better than the 
subtype-specific gold standard for deficit severity assessment, 
the GCS. Predictive performance was further improved by the 
addition of other prognostic variables, including age, prior 
stroke, and diabetes mellitus. Pretreatment neurological defi-
cit is a dominant predictor of outcome in acute stroke and so 
an essential measurement for use in prehospital clinical trials. 
Consensus recommendations for trial analysis are to incorpo-
rate the baseline neurological deficit into primary outcome 
analysis, either by use as an adjustment variable or by incor-
poration into a sliding dichotomy outcome formula.33 The 
NIHSS obtained in the ED on arrival has been used for this 
purpose in the preponderance of past acute clinical trials, but 
cannot be used in trials of prehospital start of therapy because 
the ED NIHSS is then a postrandomization assessment and 
may already reflect early response to the study intervention. 
The LAMS was used as the baseline severity adjustment 
variable in analyses of the FAST-MAG trial9 and is currently

 Kim et al  Field Validation of the LAMS   305
being used in the sliding dichotomy primary end point for a 
trial of prehospital initiation of NA-1 (NCT02315443). The 
findings of the current study support this use of the LAMS in 
current and future trials.
This study does have several limitations. The study was 
performed among patients enrolled in a randomized clinical 
trial. Though the trial entry criteria were broad, the results 
may not be generalizable to patients who did not meet study 
entry criteria, such as patients with severe preexisting dis-
ability before onset of the current stroke. The EPA NIHSS 
examination analyzed in this study was performed a median 
of 83 minutes after ED arrival, when study personnel arrived 
at each performance site; in clinical practice, initial postar-
rival NIHSS exams may be performed earlier after arrival by 
immediately available clinical personnel and, given greater 
subsequent course fluctuation, would be expected to correlate 
with 3-month outcomes mildly less well than the exams here 
reported. Early vessel imaging after hospital arrival was not 
obtained routinely in studied patients, so that analysis of using 
the LAMS to identify patients with or without large vessel 
occlusions could not be conducted in the overall data set. A 
subsequent analysis is planned using data from a participating 
receiving hospital where early vessel imaging was acquired in 
consecutive patients.
We conclude that this large, prospective, prehospital trial 
has demonstrated that the LAMS has good to excellent conver-
gent, divergent, and predictive validity and is well calibrated, 
further establishing it as a validated instrument to character-
ize stroke severity in the field. The LAMS is an appropriate 
instrument for paramedic use when stroke-deficit severity 
needs to be documented in the prehospital setting, for research 
randomized trials and for clinical assessment of outcomes in 
regional systems of stroke care.
