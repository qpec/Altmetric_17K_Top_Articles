Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) are diverse and ubiquitous, and their ability to sting is familiar to many of us. 
However, their venoms remain largely unstudied. We provide the first comprehensive characterization of a 
polypeptidic ant venom, that of the giant red bull ant, Myrmecia gulosa. We reveal a suite of novel peptides with 
a range of posttranslational modifications, including disulfide bond formation, dimerization, and glycosylation. 
One venom peptide has sequence features consistent with an epidermal growth factor fold, while the remaining 
peptides have features suggestive of a capacity to form amphipathic helices. We show that these peptides are 
derived from what appears to be a single, pharmacologically diverse, gene superfamily (aculeatoxins) that in-
cludes most venom peptides previously reported from the aculeate Hymenoptera. Two aculeatoxins purified 
from the venom were found to be capable of activating mammalian sensory neurons, consistent with the capacity 
to produce pain but via distinct mechanisms of action. Further investigation of the major venom peptide MIITX1-
Mg1a revealed that it can also incapacitate arthropods, indicative of dual utility in both defense and predation. 
MIITX1-Mg1a accomplishes these functions by generating a leak in membrane ion conductance, which alters mem-
brane potential and triggers neuronal depolarization. Our results provide the first insights into the evolution of the 
major toxin gene superfamily of the aculeate Hymenoptera and provide a new paradigm in the functional evolu-
tion of toxins from animal venoms.
INTRODUCTION
Hymenopteran venoms have been the subject of scientific investi-
gation for centuries (1). Detailed analyses of hymenopteran venom 
composition and the characterization of individual venom compo-
nents began in the 1950s (2). However, research to date has largely 
been limited to studies on the venoms of bees and wasps of the fam-
ilies Apidae and Vespidae, respectively, with the major active venom 
components shown to be peptides. The venoms of other hymenopteran 
families, including the Formicidae (ants), have remained largely 
unstudied. In the case of ants, this is probably owing not only to 
their relatively small size (and venom yield) but also to the wide-
spread misconception that ants have very simple, primarily formic 
acid (FA)–containing venoms. FA is indeed the major and primary 
active component of the venoms of ants of the subfamily Formicinae 
(3). Moreover, the venoms of fire ants (subfamily Myrmicinae) are 
relatively simple and composed primarily of a suite of small alkaloids 
(4). However, there is accumulating evidence that these simple, largely 
nonpeptidic ant venoms are the exception rather than the rule.
In 1964, Cavill et al. (5) revealed for the first time that, like bees 
and wasps, the venoms of some ants were primarily polypeptidic. 
The subject of this pivotal study was the ant Myrmecia gulosa (the 
giant red bull ant) from the subfamily Myrmeciinae (not to be con-
fused with Myrmicinae). Cavill et al. showed that (i) the venom of 
M. gulosa is primarily polypeptidic [with a small amount of hista-
mine (~2%)], (ii) at least eight distinct polypeptide fractions could 
be separated by electrophoresis, and (iii) multiple distinct biological 
activities are associated with some of these polypeptide fractions, 
namely, hyaluronidase, kinin-like, and hemolytic activity. Further 
studies have since revealed that the venoms of other species of 
Myrmeciinae are similarly polypeptidic (6–12), as are those of ants 
of at least seven other subfamilies, namely, Amblyoponerinae (13), 
Dorylinae (14), Ectatomminae (15), Myrmicinae (16), Paraponerinae 
(17), Ponerinae (18), and Pseudomyrmecinae (19).
Until recently, however, little work had been done beyond sim-
ply establishing the polypeptidic nature of these ant venoms. For 
several species, individual venom peptides have now been isolated 
and characterized [for a review, see (20)]. Venom gland transcrip-
tomes have also been generated for three species (21–23), but in the 
absence of corresponding proteomic data, their value in defining 
the genuine venom composition of these species is limited (24–26). 
In short, a comprehensive characterization of the venom repertoire 
of any species of ant (Formicidae) has been lacking.
Here, we used a combination of transcriptomics and mass spec-
trometry (MS)–based proteomics to provide the first comprehensive 
characterization of the polypeptide repertoire of an ant venom—that 
of the giant red bull ant, M. gulosa (Fig. 1A). Analysis of the encoding 
transcripts reveals that all but one of the venom peptides are derived 
from what appears to be a structurally and functionally hyperdiverse 
toxin gene superfamily that includes almost all venom peptides previ-
ously reported from aculeate Hymenoptera. Pharmacological experi-
ments demonstrated that members of this toxin gene family account 
for multiple mechanisms of action within the venom of M. gulosa and 
that the major venom peptide has a mechanism of action that gives it 
dual utility in both defensive and predatory interactions.

RESULTS
The venom composition of M. gulosa
To generate a full portrait of the polypeptidic venom composition 
of M. gulosa, we used a combined transcriptomics and MS-based 
proteomics strategy. A venom apparatus transcriptome of M. gulosa 
was generated as follows: 47,042,454 and 45,167,480 demultiplexed raw 
reads generated by RNA sequencing of M. gulosa venom apparatus 
[venom gland filaments, venom reservoir (including the convoluted 
gland), venom duct, and Dufour’s gland; Fig. 1C] and remaining whole 
body, respectively, were assembled de novo using Trinity (27). Assem-
bly yielded a total of 42,828 transcripts with E90 values (the number of 
transcripts that are supported by 90% of the expression data) of 14,307 
(venom apparatus) and 17,513 (remaining whole body).
Annotation of the M. gulosa assembly using a blastx (28) align-
ment against a UniProtKB database identified numerous transcripts 
as “venom”- or “toxin”-associated. These included several of the most 
highly expressed transcripts in the venom apparatus data set, which 
were identified as similar to “pilosulins,” a group of peptides previously 
detected in the venom of Myrmecia pilosula (6, 8, 12). However, many 
of the venom- or toxin-associated identifications were not supported 
by our proteomic data as genuine venom components (table S1), 
highlighting the high rate of false positives associated with similarity- 
based venom component annotation, as previously noted (24–26).
To identify transcripts encoding bona fide venom components, 
we collected injected venom from M. gulosa (movie S1) and ana-
lyzed it by MS-based proteomics. Bottom-up sequencing, search-
ing liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/
MS) data of reduced, alkylated, and trypsin- 
digested venom against 
the translated transcriptome assembly, resulted in identification of 
13 unique peptides and six proteins (Table 1). These were named 
according to the rational nomenclature proposed for other venom-
ous arthropod lineages (29, 30), including ants (20). Two additional 
peptides (MIITX1-Mg4b and MIITX1-Mg7c) that were not detected 
in our proteomic data were included as probable venom components 
based on high-sequence similarity and similarly high-expression 
levels to identified venom peptides. The six proteins identified included 
a 19.4-kDa protein [MIITX3-Mg1a, a CAP (cysteine-rich secretory 
protein, insect venom allergen antigen 5, and pathogenesis-related 
1 protein)], a venom dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4), a phosphatase, 
an esterase, and a hyaluronidase. Of these, DPP-4 is probably not a 
functional venom component but instead is responsible for the matu-
ration of venom peptides (31). Phospholipases have been reported in 
most other hymenopteran venoms studied to date (1), but we did not 
detect any tryptic peptides derived from phospholipases, suggesting 
that this class of enzyme is either absent or of very low abundance in the 
venom of M. gulosa.

To determine the complete primary structure of each of the 
identified venom peptides, we used top-down sequencing of non-
derivatized and nondigested venom (Fig. 1B). MIITX1-Mg1a, Mg3a, 
Mg5a, Mg5b, Mg7a, Mg7b, Mg7c, Mg8a, Mg8b, and Mg9a are pres-
ent in the venom as linear peptides of lengths ranging from 21 to 
70 residues. Of these, MIITX1-Mg1a and Mg9a were each detected 
with an amidated C terminus, while MIITX1-Mg7a and Mg7b were 
detected each with three N-acetylhexosamine groups. MIITX1-Mg6a 
and MIITX2-Mg1a were found to contain a single or three intra-
chain disulfides, respectively, while MIITX1-Mg2a was detected in 
the venom as a homodimer linked by a single interchain disulfide 
bond. MIITX1-Mg4a was also detected as a homodimer.
Transcripts encoding venom components corresponded to 15.9% 
(158,784 TPM) of all venom apparatus–derived reads (Fig. 1D) and 
were confined to the high-expression portion of the venom appara-
tus transcriptome where they constituted most of the most highly 
expressed transcripts (Fig. 1E). TPM values for identified venom 
peptides (as opposed to proteins) ranged from 773 to 30,120 and 
accounted for 96.4% of venom component expression (Fig. 1D and 
Table 1). For the six proteins, with the exception of MIITX3-Mg1a 
(TPM value of 5208), transcripts were expressed at much lower levels, 
with TPM values ranging from 26 to 378, all lower than the TPM 
values of the identified peptidic venom components and together 
accounting for a mere 0.3% of venom component expression (Fig. 1D 
and Table 1).
All but one of the identified venom peptides share a set of distinct 
biophysical features regardless of the presence or absence of cysteine 
residues: All are rich in lysine residues, all but MIITX1-Mg3 have a 
net positive charge, and all have sequence characteristics suggestive 
of a capacity to form amphipathic helices. The only exception is 
MIITX2-Mg1a, which shares the same six cysteine–containing struc-
tural domain as EGF. EGF domain peptides appear to be rare in animal 
venoms and, to our knowledge, have only been reported in the venoms 
of some sea anemones (25, 32, 33). Thus, the venom of M. gulosa ap-
pears to contain only four general polypeptide toxin types: 13 cationic 
and likely amphipathic helical peptides; one EGF-domain peptide; 
three enzymes, each represented by a single isoform; and two proteins 
of unknown function (CAP and MIITX3-Mg1a).
The aculeatoxin gene superfamily
Analysis of the precursor structures of each of the identified venom 
peptides revealed that all but MIITX2-Mg1a have a similar signal 
peptide sequence, and almost all of them have a similar repetitive 
and highly anionic propeptide sequence (MIITX1-Mg4a and Mg4b 
lack a propeptide). These data are suggestive of a shared gene family 
for these venom peptides. In other words, the venom repertoire of

M. gulosa appears to be largely, although not exclusively, dominated 
by peptides derived from a single gene family.
Comparison of the M. gulosa venom peptide precursor sequences 
(except MIITX1-Mg4a, MIITX1-Mg4b, and MIITX2-Mg1a, which 
lack propeptide regions) with those previously reported for other 
experimentally validated venom peptides from Formicidae revealed 
that all share a similar signal and propeptide sequence (Fig. 2). These 
include the pilosulins from M. pilosula (Myrmeciinae) (8, 34–36), 
dinoponeratoxins from Dinoponera quadriceps (Ponerinae) (22, 37), 
pilosulin-like peptides from Odontomachus monticola (Ponerinae) 
(21), and bicarinaline and related peptides from Tetramorium 
bicarinatum (Myrmicinae) (23, 38). These data suggest that, despite 
the apparent variation in their mature peptide domains (for exam-
ple, MIITX1-Mg9a versus pilosulin 3a; Fig. 2), these peptides may 
represent a single gene family. Furthermore, available evidence sug-
gests that this peptide family is not merely present in these other ant 
species but in fact also dominates their venom repertoire.
It was noted previously that the peptide precursor of pilosulin 1 
from M. pilosula has sequence similarity to that of the peptide mel-
ittin, the major venom component of the European honeybee Apis 
mellifera, suggestive of a shared gene family (39). While there is lim-
ited similarity in the signal peptide sequence, melittin does share a 
similar repetitive and highly anionic propeptide sequence with the 
ant venom peptide precursors (Fig. 2). In prepromelittin, this char-
acteristic propeptide sequence represents the recognition site for 
DPP-4, the enzyme responsible for liberating the mature melittin 
peptide (31). Given that a DPP-4 enzyme was also detected in the 
venom of M. gulosa, a shared processing mechanism seems likely 
for the ant venom peptides.
Broadening the search to venom peptide sequences from other 
hymenopterans revealed that the precursor sequences of the masto-
parans, vespa-chemotactic peptides and vespakinins of Vespidae 
venoms, the bombolitins of Apidae venoms, and pompilidotoxin of 
Pompillidae venom also share marked sequence similarity (Fig. 2). 
As with melittin, there is limited similarity in the signal peptide re-
gion but very marked similarity in the propeptide region. Again, these 
peptides are the dominant bioactive components of their respective 
venoms (1). No related sequences were detected outside of the 
infraorder Aculeata. Thus, almost all experimentally validated acu-
leate hymenopteran venom peptides (for which a corresponding pre-
cursor sequence has been determined) including the myrmeciitoxins 
described herein (except MIITX2-Mg1a), all other ant venoms pep-
tides, melittin, the mastoparans, the vespakinins, the bombolitins, 
and the pompilidotoxins share a characteristic precursor sequence, 
suggestive of a shared gene superfamily. For practical reasons, we 
have tentatively referred to this family of peptides collectively as the 
“aculeatoxin” gene superfamily.
Investigation of the defensive utility of some M. gulosa 
venom peptides
M. gulosa uses its venom defensively, and stings from Myrmeciinae 
species are notoriously painful. We therefore investigated the defen-
sive function of the venom by assaying for depolarization of verte-
brate sensory neurons isolated from the mouse dorsal root ganglion 
(DRG); among which are the neurons responsible for sensing noxious 
(painful) stimuli. Whole venom (at ~1:1000 dilution) caused an im-
mediate sharp increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) 
in mouse DRG cells (Fig. 3A). In most cells, this initial increase was 
followed by a drop in [Ca2+]i, accompanied by a corresponding in-
crease in fluorescence of the extracellular medium that indicated 
leakage of the calcium-sensitive dye from the cells, and, thus, cyto-
lytic activity. This activation of sensory neurons is consistent with 
cellular depolarization and therefore with the painful effects associ-
ated with envenomation.
We then investigated the potential defensive role of individual 
M. gulosa toxins by examining the algogenic potential of three pep-
tides purified from the venom (MIITX1-Mg1a, MIITX1-Mg2a, and 
MIITX2-Mg1a; Fig. 3B). We identified the homodimeric peptide 
MIITX1-Mg2a as a late-eluting series of broad peaks in a reversed- 
phase (RP)–HPLC chromatogram (Fig. 3B). Reanalysis by RP-HPLC 
of individual peaks revealed the same late-eluting series of broad 
peaks, indicating that the unusual RP-HPLC profile reflects slow 
conformational exchange of the peptide rather than multiple vari-
ants. This peptide caused a drop in [Ca2+]i in all cells and a corre-
sponding increase in fluorescence of the extracellular medium 
(Fig. 3C), which was preceded, in some cells, by a sharp increase of

MIITX2-Mg1a (Fig. 3B). This peptide did not cause a change in 
[Ca2+]i in DRG cells (Fig. 3C). Finally, MIITX1-Mg1a, which ac-
counts for the major peak in the venom RP-HPLC chromatogram 
(Fig. 3B), produced an immediate sharp increase of [Ca2+]i in all 
DRG cells. Like MIITX2-Mg1a but unlike MIITX1-Mg2a, however, 
this influx in Ca2+ plateaued without resulting in any observable 
dye leakage (Fig. 3C). Together, these data indicate that two of 
these three peptides are likely major contributors to the pain asso-
ciated with envenomation but use distinct mechanisms of action to 
achieve this.

Fig. 3. Action of M. gulosa venom peptides on vertebrate sensory neurons. (A) Application of whole M. gulosa venom to DRG cells produced a rapid, non–cell-specific 
increase in [Ca2+]i followed by release of fluorescent dye into the medium. Each trace represents a single cell in the field of view. Snapshots shown of the recording are at 
0 s (baseline), 33 s (3 s after addition of venom/fraction), and 150 s. (B) Three different peptides [fractions 8, 24, and 33 (f8, f24, and f33, respectively)] were purified from 
the whole venom using a single RP-HPLC step. Inset: Reanalysis of purified fractions by RP-HPLC. (C) Fraction 8 (MIITX2-Mg1a) had no effect on [Ca2+]i in sensory neurons, 
fraction 24 (MIITX1-Mg1a) caused an increase in [Ca2+]i in all sensory neurons, while fraction 33 (MIITX1-Mg2a) induced nonspecific permeabilization of cell membranes.

To further investigate its defensive utility, the major venom pep-
tide of M. gulosa, MIITX1-Mg1a, was produced by solid-phase pep-
tide synthesis (SPPS). The synthetically produced peptide coeluted 
on RP-HPLC with MIITX1-Mg1a purified from the venom (fig. S2) 
and produced the same effect on sensory neurons (at a concentra-
tion of 10 M) as the purified venom peptide.
Consistent with the observed in vitro effects, intraplantar injec-
tion of MIITX1-Mg1a in C57/BL6/J mice produced spontaneous 
nocifensive behavior (that is, licking, flinching, or shaking of the 
paw), which lasted 5 min (10 M) and 7 min (100 M; Fig. 4A). The 
minimum effective concentration tested was 10 M. We observed 
Mechanical and heat hypoalgesia (reduced pain response to normally 
painful stimuli) at 20 and 25 min after injection at the highest dose 
tested (100 M; fig. S3).
Investigation of the predatory utility of MIITX1-Mg1
Although M. gulosa (and other species of Myrmeciinae) are best 
known for their defensive stings, they also use their venom for preda-
tion. Adult workers not only are nectar feeders but also hunt other 
arthropods that they incapacitate by stinging, facilitating transport to 
the colony where they are fed to the carnivorous larvae. We therefore 
investigated a role in predatory envenomation for MIITX1-Mg1a by as-
saying for incapacitation of house crickets (Acheta domesticus; Fig. 4B).
Crickets injected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; negative 
control) and placed on their backs were able to immediately right 
themselves. Injection of MIITX1-Mg1a at doses ≥1 g/g caused im-
mediate incapacitation (inability to right after being placed on back). 
Incapacitation was dose-dependent, reversible, and nonlethal and, 
at the highest dose tested (60 g/g), lasted an average of 53 min. The 
biological effects of this peptide are therefore consistent with it hav-
ing a dual function in defense and predation.
Analysis of venom apparatus by matrix-assisted laser 
desorption/ionization MS
Some venomous animals are reportedly able to produce and store 
functionally distinct venom secretions in distinct glands (40), gland 
regions (41), or cell types (42) and use these different secretions in 
different contexts (that is, defense or predation). Because M. gulosa 
uses venom in both predatory and defensive interactions, we exam-
ined the contents of the various regions of the venom apparatus for 
indications of whether topological variations in toxin production 
might allow the ant to regulate the composition of its secreted ven-
om. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)–MS anal-
ysis of the “injected” venom painted a very similar picture of the 
venom composition to that generated by electrospray ionization 
(ESI)–MS (fig. S1). Extracts from four regions along the venom 
gland filaments, the venom reservoir, and venom duct were similar 
in peptide composition to the venom (fig. S1), with no evidence for 
regiospecific expression of venom peptides. For example, MIITX1-
Mg1a was detected along the entire venom gland, as well as in the 
venom reservoir and venom duct and in the venom. No venom pep-
tides were detected in the Dufour’s gland (fig. S1), which is consistent 
with previous reports of this being an aliphatic hydrocarbon- 
producing 
gland in M. gulosa (and our observations of it releasing an “oily” 
substance during dissection) (43). Thus, these data suggest that 
there is no morphological distinction between any function-
ally distinct venom components in the venom of M. gulosa and 
do not support behavioral modulation of venom composition. 
Further, these data are consistent with our observations of dual 
utility in defense and predation for the major venom peptide 
MIITX1-Mg1a.
Mechanism of action of MIITX1-Mg1
Although initial experiments indicated that MIITX1-Mg1a produc-
es an immediate sharp increase in [Ca2+]i in DRG cells (Figs. 3C and 
4C), this effect was not cell-specific: All DRG neurons and nonneu-
ronal cells were affected, suggesting that the peptide affects a com-
mon cellular target such as the lipid bilayer. However, we did not 
observe any dye leakage from the cells, which shows that the effect 
was also not simply cytolytic. Consistent with this observation, the 
peptide was not hemolytic to human red blood cells, although it did 
display weak cytotoxicity [inhibition of growth of human embryonic 
kidney (HEK) 293 cells] and some antimicrobial activity (table S2).
The initial data suggested a nonspecific membrane-mediated 
mechanism of action for MIITX1-Mg1a. However, we noted that the 
increase in [Ca2+]i was greater in excitable cells (neurons) than in 
the nonneuronal cells. Furthermore, in DRG neurons, the increase 
in [Ca2+]i induced by MIITX1-Mg1a was substantially reduced in 
the presence of 1 M tetrodotoxin (TTX), a blocker of some sub-
types of voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels (Fig. 4C). This im-
plied that, in DRG neurons, a large proportion of the increase in 
[Ca2+]i caused by the peptide was dependent on the presence of 
functional NaV channels (and possibly other additional cellular 
components that contribute to cellular excitability). We therefore 
examined whether the massive increase in [Ca2+]i in excitable cells 
resulted from an indirect (upstream) action on NaV channels or 
whether the peptide had the additional ability to act directly on NaV 
channels.
Whole-cell voltage-clamp electrophysiology was used to exam-
ine the effect of MIITX1-Mg1a on human NaV1.7 (the major TTX- 
sensitive NaV subtype in DRG neurons) heterologously expressed 
in HEK293 cells. When compared to buffer control, MIITX1-Mg1a, 
at concentrations <3 M, did not change peak current or activation 
and inactivation kinetics and did not induce persistent currents 
(Fig. 4D). Where concentrations exceeded 3 M, recording was not 
possible because of unstable seal from large leak currents, which is 
consistent with an action of the peptide on the lipid bilayer.
Next, using a fluorescence imaging plate reader (FLIPR) assay, 
the peptide’s ability to alter membrane potential or to allow Ca2+ 
and Na+ influx was assessed. In normal HEK293 cells (not express-
ing any NaV channels), MIITX1-Mg1a altered membrane potential 
[unaffected by the presence of TTX (1 M)] and induced Na+ and 
Ca2+ influx in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4E) with ef-
fects observed at concentrations ≥1 M. The effect on membrane 
potential was no different in HEK293 cells heterologously expressing 
hNaV1.7 channels (Fig. 4E). These data again pointed to a membrane- 
mediated mechanism of action of the peptide.
On the basis of these data, we propose the following model for 
the mechanism of action of MIITX1-Mg1a: MIITX1-Mg1a interacts 
with cell membranes, producing a concentration-dependent leak in 
ion conductance, possibly via multimeric pore formation as is the 
case with melittin (44). In excitable cells, such as mammalian sensory 
neurons, this leak in ion conductance is sufficient to shift the mem-
brane potential to threshold, initiating neuronal depolarization (and 
opening of NaV channels) and subsequent additional (and much 
larger) Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated calcium channels. This 
action, on nociceptors, would result in immediate pain. Similarly, 
the temporary paralysis observed when the peptide is injected into

insects could result from the same action on cell membranes of oth-
er excitable tissues such as muscle or peripheral motor neurons.
DISCUSSION
Here, we performed the first comprehensive characterization of the 
polypeptidic venom composition of an ant. Consistent with previ-
ous studies of other aculeate hymenopteran venoms such as those 
of wasps and bees (1), but in contrast to other arthropod venoms, 
such as those of most spiders, scorpions, or centipedes, the venom 
composition of M. gulosa is relatively simple. Most M. gulosa ven-
om peptides appear to be derived from a single gene superfamily. 
This gene superfamily includes almost all peptides identified in the 
venoms of the aculeate Hymenoptera, and hence, we have named it 
the aculeatoxin superfamily. Almost all aculeatoxins share certain 
general structural features, including a net cationic charge. Where

examined, they also all interact with lipid bilayers, and in such an 
environment, they adopt an amphipathic helical structure (1), even 
where the peptides have multiple cysteine residues (45). However, 
there is noticeable sequence diversity in the encoded mature pep-
tides (Fig. 2), and this diversity in mature peptide sequence is re-
flected in a diversity in biological activity (1). For example, melittin, 
the mastoparans, and the bombolitins all target cell membranes 
in which they form ion-permeable channels (44, 46), vespakinins 
probably exert their effect through bradykinin G protein–coupled 
receptors, while pompilidotoxins act on NaV channels (47). Phar-
macological diversity is also present in M. gulosa venom, where we 
demonstrated that multiple mechanisms of action are encoded in this 
gene family: The homodimeric peptide MIITX1-Mg2a produces 
effects in DRG cells that indicate relatively nonspecific membrane 
permeation (as is the case for the dimeric peptide MIITX-Mp1 (pre-
viously described) (45). On the other hand, MIITX1-Mg1a alters mem-
brane potential presumably by forming ion-permeable pores. The 
observed sequence diversity in the remaining peptides of M. gulosa 
and other ant venoms suggests that these peptides almost certainly 
encode further mechanistic diversity.
The structural and pharmacological diversity of aculeatoxins 
provides a marked contrast to the “classic” patterns of functional 
evolution of other, primarily ion channel–interacting, cysteine-rich 
peptide toxin gene families of the venoms of sea anemones, cone 
snails, spiders, scorpions, centipedes, and snakes (48). Unlike the 
toxins in these other venoms, the nonglobular folds of aculeatoxins 
make their evolution less likely to be constrained by structural resi-
dues that direct folding. Thus, functional, rather than structural, fac-
tors probably drive the evolution of aculeate venom peptides to a much 
greater extent than in most other peptide toxin gene families, as indi-
cated by the structural diversity and lack of “anchor points” avail-
able for accurate sequence alignment and molecular evolutionary 
analyses of the mature aculeatoxins. The interaction with metabolic 
products (cell membranes) as opposed to gene products (proteins) 
also presents a rarely considered scenario for toxin-target coevolution. 
This scenario is relevant not only for the aculeatoxins (which repre-
sent the major venom peptide class of the aculeate Hymenoptera) 
but also other membrane-interacting venom peptides, such as the 
“antimicrobial peptides” of some spider and scorpion venoms 
(49, 50). The evolution of membrane-interacting toxin gene super-
families thus represents a significant challenge to understanding 
the processes that govern the functional diversification of venom 
peptides.
One question that arises from our data is why there is more than 
one pain-producing peptide in the venom of M. gulosa. For the 
European honeybee, A. mellifera, the peptide melittin is the sole 
pain-producing component of the venom (51). Another question is 
why, in the venom of M. gulosa, there are (at least) two different 
peptides (MIITX1-Mg1a and MIITX1-Mg2a) that act by permeabi-
lizing cell membranes. Both peptides produce an effect that would 
ultimately lead to neuronal depolarization and pain, and presum-
ably, one of these alone would be sufficient to meet the defensive 
needs of the ant. One hypothesis, based on the broad range of natu-
ral predators and prey that M. gulosa has, is that different venom 
peptides may have distinct tissue or cell-type selectivity profiles for 
different membrane compositions. Under this scenario, peptides 
are likely to act synergistically to produce an effect, either systemi-
cally or locally on cell membranes, that is stronger than each pep-
tide alone. If this were the case, then the venoms of not only the 
Formicidae but also those of the aculeate Hymenoptera as a whole 
might represent a vast library of membrane-selective peptides with 
potential use as research tools or even antimicrobial or anticancer 
drugs. The exploration of the venoms of the aculeate Hymenoptera 
in this context is an exciting prospect.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Venom collection
Adult workers of M. gulosa were collected from a single colony near 
Kooringal, Moreton Island, Queensland, Australia. Venom was col-
lected from three individuals through a combination of defensive 
stinging (movie S1) followed by electrostimulation of the abdomen 
(in an effort to deplete the venom reservoir and maximize the 
expression of toxin genes before RNA extraction for transcriptome 
sequencing). Defensive stings were collected by holding the ant 
with a pair of forceps while allowing it to sting through a layer of 
parafilm covering the opening of a 1.5-ml tube. Each ant aggressive-
ly and repeatedly stung the parafilm layer presented to it, deposit-
ing, on most occasions, a small drop of clear colorless venom. When 
no more defensive venom was secreted, the ant was allowed to rest 
for approximately 10 min. The procedure was then repeated while 
applying a mild electric current (15 V, ~1 mA) to the abdomen as 
soon as the stinger was inserted into the parafilm membrane, result-
ing in additional venom being expelled. Venom was collected from 
the bottom of the parafilm layer and the sides of the tube by rinsing 
with 10 l of ultrapure water. Venom was then stored at −80°C until 
further analysis. We found no observable differences by LC-MS/MS 
of native venom (see below) between voluntary secreted venom and 
that obtained with electrostimulation, and pooled venom drops were 
used for subsequent analyses.
Transcriptome sequencing and assembly
Venom apparatuses (venom gland filaments, venom reservoir, ven-
om duct, and Dufour’s gland) were dissected from the ants 3 days 
after venom collection (using the same three individuals from which 
venom was collected). Using TRIzol (Life Technologies), total RNA 
was extracted from the complete venom apparatus (venom gland 
filaments, venom reservoir, venom duct, and Dufour’s gland) and the 
remaining whole body (yielding 26.8 and 49.2 g of RNA, respectively).
Complementary DNA library preparation and sequencing was 
performed by the Institute for Molecular Bioscience Sequencing 
Facility, The University of Queensland. A dual-indexed library was 
constructed with the TruSeq-3 Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit 
(Illumina) with oligo (dT) selection and an average insert size of 
180 base pairs. Samples were pooled in a batch of 15 samples, and 
150-cycle paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina 
NextSeq 500 instrument.
Adapter trimming of demultiplexed raw reads was performed 
using fqtrim (52), followed by quality trimming and filtering using 
prinseq-lite (53). Error correction was performed using the BBnorm 
ecc tool, which is a part of the BBtools package. Trimmed and error- 
corrected reads were assembled using Trinity (version 2.2.1) (27) with a 
k-mer length of 31 and a minimum k-mer coverage of 10. Assembled 
transcripts were annotated using a blastx (28) search (E value setting 
of 1 × 10−3) against a database derived from UniProtKB. TPM counts 
were generated using the Trinity RSEM (54) plugin (align_and_
estimate_abundance). Toxin transcripts were manually examined 
using the Map-to-Reference tool of Geneious version 10.2.3 (55).

Toxin precursor sequences have been deposited with the transcriptome 
shotgun assembly database as GGFG01000001–GGFG01000022.
Proteomic analysis of venom
Bottom-up proteomics was used as a first step to identify venom 
components. Ten micrograms of crude venom was dried by vacuum 
centrifugation and resuspended in 4 M urea, 10% ACN, and 100 mM 
ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8). Cystines were reduced by incuba-
tion with 5 mM dithiothreitol at 60°C for 5 min and then alkylated 
with 10 mM iodoacetamide at 37°C for 60 min. Reduced and al-
kylated venom was then digested by incubating with trypsin (20 ng/l) 
overnight at 37°C in 2 M urea, 10% ACN, and 100 mM ammonium 
bicarbonate (pH 8) at a final substrate-to-enzyme ratio of 50:1. The 
digested sample was desalted using a C18 ZipTip (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) and dried by vacuum centrifugation before LC-ESI-
MS/MS analysis.
Digested venom was reconstituted in 0.5% FA, and 2 g was sep-
arated on a Shimadzu (Japan) Nexera uHPLC with an Agilent Zorbax 
stable-bond C18 column (2.1 mm × 100 mm; particle size, 1.8 m; 
pore size, 300 Å), using a flow rate of 180 l/min and a gradient of 1 
to 40% solvent B (90% ACN and 0.1% FA) in 0.1% FA over 45 min 
and analyzed on an AB Sciex 5600 TripleTOF mass spectrometer 
equipped with a Turbo-V source heated to 550°C. MS survey scans 
were acquired at 300 to 1800 mass/charge ratio (m/z) over 250 ms, 
and the 20 most intense ions with a charge of +2 to +5 and an inten-
sity of at least 120 counts were selected for MS/MS. The unit mass 
precursor ion inclusion window mass within ±0.7 Da and isotopes 
within ±2 Da were excluded from MS/MS, with scans acquired at 80 
to 1400 m/z over 100 ms and optimized for high resolution. Using 
ProteinPilot version 5.0 (ABSciex), MS/MS spectra were searched 
against the venom apparatus transcriptome [translated and filtered 
to transcripts containing an open-reading frame of >40 amino acids 
and a signal peptide sequence (signalP D value of >0.3)]. Peptides 
identified by ProteinPilot were validated by comparison of experi-
mentally derived peaks against a theoretical peak list generated 
using MS-Product in ProteinProspector 5.19.4 (http://prospector.
ucsf.edu/prospector/cgi-bin/msform.cgi?form=msproduct).
Top-down proteomics was used to determine the complete pri-
mary structure of identified venom components. Native venom 
(2 g) was analyzed by LC-MS/MS, as described above. ProteinPilot 
was used to match transcripts to major peaks in the total ion chro-
matogram. All peptides identified by ProteinPilot were validated by 
comparison of experimentally derived MS/MS peaks against a the-
oretical peak list generated using MS-Product in ProteinProspector 
version 5.19.4 (http://prospector.ucsf.edu/prospector/cgi-bin/msform.
cgi?form=msproduct). Major peaks remaining unassigned follow-
ing the ProteinPilot search were sequenced de novo to identify the 
corresponding transcript in the transcriptome. Venom components 
were named following the rational nomenclature established by 
King et al. (29), with the minor modification of a subscript number 
indicating the gene family to which a venom peptide belongs (30).
Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization  
mass spectromery
The venom apparatus of one “nonmilked” M. gulosa specimen 
was divided into four gland sections, the venom reservoir, and the 
venom duct. Each sample was mixed and then centrifuged to pellet 
tissue. The venom gland samples were concentrated using a C18 ZipTip 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific): 20 l was loaded onto the ZipTip, washed 
with 10 l of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and eluted in approx-
imately 2 l of ACN. Venom reservoir, venom duct, and Dufour’s 
gland samples and an aliquot of injected venom were diluted 1:10. 
One microliter of each sample was mixed with 2 l of diluted -cyano- 
4-hydroxycinnamic acid solution [stored as an acetone-saturated 
solution and diluted 1 in 10 with a solution of ethanol/acetone/0.1% 
TFA (6:3:1) as a working solution] and spotted onto a polished steel 
target. MALDI spectra were acquired using a Bruker Autoflex Speed 
MALDI-TOF/TOF system (Bruker Daltonics Inc.) in linear positive 
mode at 2000 Hz, with an m/z range from 1000 to 15,000. Ten spectra 
of 500 shots each were saved. The group of 10 spectra were loaded 
into ClinProt Tools version 3.0 (Bruker Daltonics Inc.) as a separate 
group and observed as a gel view, with the averaged spectrum for 
the entire data set produced after recalibration of the entire loaded 
sample cohort.
Purification of venom peptides by RP-HPLC
Approximately 500 g of venom was separated on a Phenomenex 
Gemini NX-C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm; particle size, 3 m; pore 
size, 110 Å) using a gradient of 15 to 45% solvent B (90% ACN and 
0.05% TFA) over 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1. Fractions were 
collected on the basis of absorbance at 214 nm. MALDI-MS was 
used to confirm the identity of the peptide/s present in each frac-
tion, and purity was assessed by rerunning an aliquot of each under 
the same conditions. Purified fractions containing MIITX1-Mg1a, 
MIITX1-Mg2a, and MIITX2-Mg1a were dried by vacuum concen-
tration and resuspended in 80 l of pure water from which 7 l- 
aliquots were used for calcium imaging experiments.
Peptide synthesis
MIITX1-Mg1a was prepared at a 100-mol scale using Fmoc 
(9- 
fluorenyl methoxycarbonyl) SPPS on Protide Rink Amide resin 
(CEM Corporation). The peptide was elongated on a CEM Liberty 
Blue automated microwave peptide synthesizer [4-min coupling 
cycle: 2-min coupling (90°C), 1-min deprotection (90°C), 1-min as-
sociated washes and liquid handling] using a fivefold excess of Fmoc 
amino acid, ethyl cyanohydroxyiminoacetate (Oxyma), and diiso-
propylcarbodiimide. Fifty micromoles of peptide was cleaved from 
the resin and deprotected with a TFA-based cleavage solution [TFA/ 
triisopropylsilane/H2O (95:2.5:2.5)] for 2 hours at room tempera-
ture and then worked up with diethyl ether and lyophilized. MIITX1- 
Mg1a was purified from the crude material [to ≥95% with a yield 
of 11.2 mg (7.1%)] using a 20 to 40% solvent B (99.9% ACN and 
0.1% TFA) gradient over 40 min (15 ml/min−1) on a Waters Sunfire 
C18 OBD preparative column (pore size, 5 m; 19 mm × 150 mm). 
The identity of the peptide was confirmed by MS using a Shimadzu 
UPLC-ESI-MS 2020 instrument (Theoretical [M+2H]2+, 1574.4; 
observed [M+2H]2+, 1574.4), and purity was determined on a Waters 
Acquity UPLC system (Acquity C18 BEH; pore size, 1.7 m; column, 
2.1 mm × 50 mm) at 0 to 70% solvent B (99.9% ACN and 0.1% TFA) 
over 5 min at 0.6 ml min−1.
Calcium imaging assay of vertebrate sensory neurons
DRG from 4- to 8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were dissociated 
and plated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Gibco) con-
taining 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Assaymatrix) and penicillin/
streptomycin (Gibco) on a 96-well poly-d-lysine–coated culture plate 
(Corning) and maintained overnight. Cells were loaded with Fluo-4 
AM calcium indicator, according to the manufacturer’s instructions

(Thermo Fisher Scientific). After loading (1 hour), the dye-containing 
solution was replaced with assay solution (1× Hanks’ balanced salt 
solution and 20 mM Hepes). Fluorescence corresponding to [Ca2+]i 
of typically 100 to 150 DRG cells per experiment was monitored in 
parallel using a Nikon Ti-E Deconvolution inverted microscope, 
equipped with a Lumencor Spectra LED Lightsource. Images were 
acquired at a 20× objective at 1 frame/s (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 
521 nm). 
 For each experiment, baseline fluorescence was monitored 
for 20 s, and at 30 s, the assay solution was replaced with an assay 
solution containing individual peptides [1:10 dilution of resuspended 
fraction (described above)] or whole venom (1:1000 dilution). Ex-
periments involving the use of mouse tissue were approved by The 
University of Queensland animal ethics committee.
Pain behavior experiments
Male adult (12 to 15 weeks old) C57BL/6J mice were used for be-
havioral experiments. MIITX1-Mg1a (1, 10, or 100 M) diluted in 
saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) was adminis-
tered in a volume of 20 l into the hind paw by shallow intraplantar 
injection. Following injection, spontaneous nocifensive behavior events 
were counted, from video recordings, by a blinded observer. Con-
trol animals were injected with saline containing 0.1% BSA.
Mechanical paw withdrawal thresholds after intraplantar injec-
tion of MIITX1-Mg1a (1, 10, or 100 M) were measured using an 
electronic von Frey apparatus (MouseMet Electronic von Frey, 
Topcat Metrology Ltd.). Briefly, the von Frey filament was placed 
against the plantar surface of the injected hind paw, and the force 
was gradually increased until the mice responded with the with-
drawal of the paw. The average of three measurements per mouse 
was used as one biological replicate.
Thermal paw withdrawal thresholds after intraplantar injection 
of MIITX1-Mg1a (1, 10, or 100 M) were measured using a MouseMet 
Thermal apparatus (Topcat Metrology Ltd.). Briefly, the preheated 
(37°C) thermal probe tip was applied to the plantar surface of the in-
jected paw, which automatically induced the gradual heating (+2.5°C/s) 
of the probe until the mice responded with the withdrawal of the paw. 
The average of three measurements per mouse was used as one bio-
logical replicate.
All mice were acclimatized before experiments, and all measure-
ments were performed by a blinded observer. Experiments involv-
ing animals were approved by The University of Queensland animal 
ethics committee.
Insect incapacitation assay
House crickets (A. domesticus; average mass, 150 mg; Pisces Live 
Food) were injected intra-abdominally with different doses of MIITX1- 
Mg1a (in 2 l of PBS) and placed on their back, and the time taken 
to “right” was measured and compared with that of negative control 
crickets injected with 2 l of PBS. Lethality was assessed at 24 hours.
Whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology
Whole-cell patch-clamp experiments were performed with HEK293 
cells heterologously expressing human NaV1.7 (SB Drug Discovery) 
using a QPatch 16X automated electrophysiology platform (Sophion 
Bioscience). The extracellular solution contained the following: 
70 mM NaCl, 70 mM choline chloride, 4 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 
1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Hepes, and 10 mM glucose (pH 7.4; osmolarity, 
305 mosmol). The intracellular solution contained the following: 
140 mM CsF, 1 mM:5 mM EGTA/CsOH, 10 mM Hepes, and 10 mM 
NaCl (pH 7.3 with CsOH; osmolarity, 320 mosmol). MIITX1-Mg1a 
was diluted in extracellular solution with 0.05% BSA at a concentra-
tion of 3 M. MIITX1-Mg1a effects were compared to pretoxin con-
trol conditions on the same cell with incubation times for buffer and 
MIITX1-Mg1a of 5 min each. NaV1.7 currents were induced with a 
holding potential of −90 mV followed by a 50-ms test pulse to −20 mV 
and a 0.05-Hz pulse frequency.
FLIPR assays
HEK293 cells and HEK293 cells heterologously expressing human 
NaV1.7 channels (SB Drug Discovery) were cultured in Eagle’s min-
imal essential medium (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 10% FBS (Assay 
Matrix Pty Ltd.), 2 mM l-glutamine, and selection antibiotics [blas-
ticidin (4 g/ml) and geneticin (0.6 mg/ml); hNaV1.7-expressing 
cells only). The cells were grown in a humid incubator at 37°C with 
5% CO2 and passaged every 3 to 4 days using TrypLE Express 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Dissociated cells were plated into 384-
well clear-bottom black-walled imaging plates (Corning) at a density 
of 10,000 to 15,000 cells per well. After 48 hours, the growth medium 
was removed from the wells, and the cells were loaded with red 
membrane potential dye (Molecular Devices), Calcium 4 No-Wash 
dye (Molecular Devices), or Asante NaTRIUM Green-2 (ANG-2 
sodium dye) (Abcam) diluted in physiological salt solution (PSS; 
composition: 140 mM NaCl, 11.5 mM glucose, 5.9 mM KCl, 1.4 mM 
MgCl2, 1.2 mM Na2H2PO4, 5 mM NaHCO3, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 10 mM 
Hepes (pH 7.4)] for 30 min at 37°C, with 5% CO2. MIITX1-Mg1a 
was diluted in PSS/0.1% BSA and added to HEK293 cells and 
NaV1.7-expressing HEK293 cells using the FLIPRTETRA. Changes in 
membrane potential, [Ca2+]i, or intracellular [Na+] were monitored 
with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (excitation: 515 to 545 nm, 
470 to 495 nm, and 470 to 495 nm; emission: 565 to 625 nm, 515 to 
575 nm, and 515 to 575 nm, respectively) with reads taken every 1 s 
for 10 s before (baseline values) and 310 s after peptide addition. 
PSS/0.1% BSA was used as a negative control.
Statistical analyses
Raw FLIPR fluorescence values were converted to response over base-
line values, and a negative control correction was performed using 
the FLIPRTETRA software ScreenWorks 3.2.0.14 (Molecular Devices). 
The AUC values were exported, and data were plotted and analyzed 
using GraphPad Prism version 7.00. To calculate concentration- 
response curves, a four-parameter Hill equation with variable Hill 
slope was fitted to the data. All data were expressed as the means ± 
SEM and are representative of at least three independent experiments. 
Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05 and was calculated using 
an unpaired Student’s t tests. For pain behavior experiments, the data 
were expressed as means ± SEM. Statistical significance compared 
to vehicle controls was determined in GraphPad Prism version 7.00 
using two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparison test (spon-
taneous pain measurements) or one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s 
multiple comparison test (mechanical and heat sensitivity measure-
ments). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.
