Abstract Can renal prognosis and life expectancy be accu-
rately predicted? Increasingly, the answer is yes. The natural
history of different forms of renal disease is becoming clearer;
the degree of reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and
the magnitude of proteinuria are strong predictors of renal
outcome. Actuarial data on life expectancy from the start of
renal replacement therapy are available from renal registries
such as the U.S. Renal Data System (USRDS), and the
UK Renal Registry. Recently, similar data have become avail-
able for patients with chronic kidney disease. Data collected
from a large population-based registry in Alberta, Canada and
stratified for different levels of estimated GFR (eGFR) have
shown that the reduction in life expectancy with kidney failure
is not a uremic event associated with starting dialysis but a
continuous process that is evident from an eGFR of ≤60
ml/min. Nevertheless, despite the poor prognosis of the last
stages of renal failure, progress in the treatment and manage-
ment of these patients and, in particular, of their cardiovascu-
lar risk factors continues to improve long-term outcome.

Introduction
How much do we know about renal prognosis and life expec-
tancy in adolescents with chronic kidney disease (CKD)? If
one sees a new patient, a 19-year-old youth with a serum
creatinine level of 200 μmol/l, can one predict his likely renal
prognosis and his life expectancy? The answer is yes, and this
is frequently done when the question is posed in a medico-
legal context; however, is the answer accurate?
We know that life expectancy is much reduced with end-
stage renal failure—but what about the different degrees or
stages of renal failure? For this review I have searched the
adult and paediatric literature for papers cited in PubMed
and Google Scholar that might contain data on life expectancy
with CKD, or for series that have followed patients with CKD
from childhood to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and
through to renal replacement therapy (RRT). I summarise
the evidence on the prediction of renal prognosis, describe
important new data from Canada that for the first time looks
at life expectancy with different stages of CKD and cite the
U.S. Renal Data System (USRDS) and UK renal registries
that report annual data regarding life expectancy with RRT.
Predicting renal outcome
To predict renal outcome I first make a number of assump-
tions. On the balance of probabilities (medico-legal language
for a >50 % chance), at this age (19 years) the patient will have
some form of renal dysplasia that would fall under the general
heading of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary
tract (CAKUT)—or some other congenital disease that might
be tubular. If my history and examination make both of these
possibilities unlikely, then further investigation is required
which might include a biopsy.
If the patient has no proteinuria (protein creatinine ratio
<50 mg/mmol), then the renal function should be currently
stable. Renal deterioration will not occur until there is increas-
ing proteinuria [1–5]. The exception to this would be a pure

 tubular disease, and I am assuming that this disease will have
been picked up during the history, examination and other basic
investigations.
Patients with inexorably progressive renal failure tend
to deteriorate at a rate proportional to their proteinuria [6],
but generally speaking the more proteinuria, the more the
rate of progression can be slowed by angiotensin
converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and good control
of blood pressure [2, 7–9].
Patients with small asymmetric kidneys (renal
hypodysplasia—often described in the UK as reflux nephrop-
athy) tend to deteriorate at the slowest rates, and this is rarely
greater than an estimated glomerular filtration ration (eGFR)
of 3–4 ml/min/1.73 m2/year [3, 7]. Studies by of our own
group have shown that controlling blood pressure and reduc-
ing proteinuria with an ACEI should reduce the rate of loss
down to around 1.5 ml/min/1.73 m2/year [2, 7].
Assuming that the 19-year-old patient with a serum creat-
inine level of 200 μmol/l has an eGFR of 35 ml/min/1.73 m2
and that he will need dialysis when his eGFR is around 10
ml/min/1.73 m2, then he should reach ESRD in approximately
17 years [(35 − 10) divided by 1.5 years]. If he were to lose
function at the faster rate of 3 ml/min/year, this would be
8.3 years.
Life expectancy with CKD
Life expectancy tables for people with CKD have been
created from a large population-based registry in Alberta,
Canada and stratified for different levels of eGFR [10].
Data are calculated for men and women from 30 years of
age to age 85 years by their levels of kidney function as
defined by eGFRs of ≥60, 45–59, 30–44 and 15–29
ml/min/1.73 m2 (see Table 1) [10]. These data show that
life expectancy is progressively reduced with each age
band of worse renal function.
Assuming our 19-year-old patient will be alive in
11 years, when he reaches 30 (the starting age of the
Canadian data), what can be expected? Looking at men
age 30–34 years (see Table 1), the life expectancy for those
with an eGFR of ≥60 ml/min/1.73 m2 is 39.1 years. This is
lower than expected and certainly much less than in the UK
database. For instance, data from the UK predict that a
normal, healthy white male aged 30 years in 2015 has a
remaining expected lifetime of 50.7 years [11]. The equiv-
alent figure for the USA suggests that for a 30- to 34-year-
old male the expected life expectancy is 45.7 years [12]
(see Table 2). The authors of this latter study explain that
this difference is attributed to the selective nature of their
study cohort, which was limited to individuals who had
outpatient serum creatinine measurements as part of rou-
tine care. They write that those with an eGFR of >60 ml/
min/1.73 m2 cannot be considered as a Bnormal
population^ as patients having their creatinine measured
are likely to be less well than the general population
(who would not have a creatinine measure) and therefore
have a lower life expectancy.
From Table 1 it can be seen that for the first three age
groups (30–34, 35–39, 40–44 years), life expectancy falls by
approximately 20 % with an eGFR of 45–59 ml/min/1.73 m2,
by approximately 50 % with an eGFR of 30–44 ml/min/
1.73 m2 and by approximately 65 % with an eGFR of 15–
29 ml/min/1.73 m2, when compared with those with an eGFR
of ≥60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (note: these figures are calculated from
the first three age groups, i.e. 30, 35 and 40 years, respective-
ly). Thus, the GFR of our patient now age 30 would be ap-
proximately 19 ml/min/1.73 m2 (eGFR decline of 1.5 ml/min/
1.73 m2) and that at this level of function his life expectancy is
reduced by 70 % from 50.6 to 15 years.
The excess mortality associated with renal failure is due
principally to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
An investigation of the causes of death associated with
CKD in Alberta revealed that the major cause of death
was cardiovascular (including an increase in heart failure
and valvular disease). The unadjusted proportion of pa-
tients who died from cardiovascular disease increased with
decreasing eGFR [21, 37, 41, and 44 % of patients with an
eGFR of ≥60 (with proteinuria), 45–59.9, 30–44.9, and
15–29.9 ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively]. The proportion of
deaths from infection also increased but not those from
cancer [13].
In a separate review using meta-analysis to examine the
influence of both reduced eGFR and albuminuria on car-
diovascular mortality the authors found that both lower
eGFR (<60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and higher albumin/
creatinine ratio (ACR ≥10 mg/g) were independent predic-
tors of mortality risk in the general population [14].
Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality at
eGFRs of 60, 45 and 15 ml/min/1.73 m2 (vs. 95 ml/min/
1.73 m2) were 1.18 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.05–
1.32], 1.57 (95 % CI 1.39–1.78) and 3.14 (95 % CI 2.39–
4.13), respectively. The ACR was associated with mortal-
ity risk linearly on the log-log scale without threshold ef-
fects. Adjusted HRs for all-cause mortality at ACRs of 10,
30, and 300 mg/g (vs. 5 mg/g) were 1.20 (1.15–1.26), 1.63
(1.50–1.77) and 2.22 (1.97–2.51), respectively. These data
are derived from populations a higher mean age, but age
was not an independent variable.
Thus, our patient, aged 19–36, even with an eGFR of
approximately 45 ml/min/1.73 m2, has an increased risk of
dying of around 57 % [risk ratio (RR) 1.57] compared with
an eGFR of 95 ml/min/1.73 m2; similarly, with a ACR of
30 mg/g, our patient has an increased risk of dying of
around 63 % (RR 1.63) compared with ACR of 5 mg/g
[14]. These figures correlate with life expectancy tables
244
Pediatr Nephrol (2017) 32:243–248
 [10] in which a 30-year male with an eGFR of 30–44
ml/min/1.73 m2 has a life expectancy reduced by approx-
imately 50 % compared with a similar patient with an
eGFR of ≥60 ml/min/1.73 m2.
To this equation we should also consider modification of
life expectancy by such factors as race, gender and socio-
economic status [15, 16], as well as control of blood pressure
and hyperlipidemia [17]. All of these factors are being studied
in the ongoing Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD)
Study.
Predicting life expectancy at end-stage
If our patient is well looked after for the next 17 years, I will
assume that he will not die before he reaches ESRD at the age
of 36 (age 19 + 17 years at a GFR decline rate of 1.5 ml/min/
1.73 m2/year). However, we now know that this assumption
cannot be made. As we have seen from the Canadian data,
even at age 19 years with a GFR of 35 ml/min/1.73 m2, we can
extrapolate that his life expectancy is reduced by around 50 %.
For a UK male aged 19 years, a life expectancy of 61.4 years
[11] is reduced to 30 years (age 49 years) [10].
Assuming that our patient would be around 36 years of age
when end-stage renal failure is reached, then one can use two
sources of actuarial information regarding future life
expectancy:-
1)
The USRDS Annual Report’s chapter on mortality and
survival has actuarial tables which show data in 5-year
age bands [12] (Table 2). Thus, at 36 years of age, our
patient falls into the age band 35–39 years. This shows us
that a normal U.S. male of this age group can expect to
live a further 41 years. The same age group will live a
further 12.5 years on dialysis and 30.8 years after a suc-
cessful transplant. Of course, in reality, RRT life will tend
to be a mixture of the two modes.
2)
The UK Renal Registry annual report chapter on survival
also has actuarial data in 5-year age bands [18]. However,
these show that the median life expectancy for patients

 starting RRT at the 90-day time point and for this age
group (35–39 years) is a further 13.5 years (dialysis and
transplant combined).

In comparison, the Canadian data show that at age 35
years with an eGFR of 15–29 ml/min/1.73 m2, the re-
maining life expectancy is +13.8 years [10].
Trends in life expectancy
A review of annual reports from the USRDS in the period
1996–2013 reveals that the life expectancy for a 36-year-old
man on haemodialysis has improved steadily and linearly
from 7.2 years in 1996 to 11.5 years in 2013 (see Fig. 1).
Thus, one can anticipate that our current projections of life
expectancy probably err on the pessimistic side of reality.
This is supported by a detailed analysis of paediatric outcome
over the period 1990–2010 [19].
Summary and conclusions
We can now predict renal outcome and life expectancy with
some accuracy, but data sources on life expectancy are few.
The new information from Canada on life expectancy with
CKD is very important but will need verifying from other
parts of the world. We must not forget that collected data are
often a decade old before they are analysed and published.
While several long-term studies like CKiD [15–17] are run-
ning, it is still too early for them to have generated new infor-
mation on life expectancy. However, trends in outcome con-
tinue to improve, suggesting that we can be more optimistic
than current data suggest.
Summary points
1.
Life expectancy is reduced for all levels of renal function
below an eGFR of 60 ml/min/1.73 m2.
2.
Actuarial data are now available on life expectancy both
for patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage
kidney disease.
3.
The increased risk of premature death is principally relat-
ed to the increase in cardiovascular morbidity.
