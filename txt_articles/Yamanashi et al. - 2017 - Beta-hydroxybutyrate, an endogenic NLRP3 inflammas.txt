Neuro-inflammation has been shown to play a critical role in the development of depression. Beta-
hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is a ketone body and has recently been reported to exert anti-inflammatory 
effects via inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome. Here, we investigated the potential antidepressant 
and anti-inflammatory effects of BHB on rats exposed to acute and chronic stress. We examined the 
influence of repeated BHB administration on depressive and anxiety behaviors in a rodent model of 
chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). Additionally, the influence of acute immobilization (IMM) stress 
and single BHB administration on hippocampal interleukin-1β
 (IL-1β
) and tumor necrosis factor-α
 
(TNF-α
) were assessed. Repeated administration of BHB attenuated CUS-induced depressive- and 
anxiety-related behaviors. IMM stress increased levels of IL-1β
 in the hippocampus, while a single 
pre-administration of BHB attenuated this increase. Although no effect was observed on hippocampal 
TNF-α
 levels after 1 h of IMM stress, a single BHB pre-administration reduced hippocampal TNF-α
. 
Our previous report showed that the release of IL-1β
 and TNF-α
 caused by stress is tightly regulated 
by NLRP3 inflammasome. These findings demonstrate that BHB exerts antidepressant-like effects, 
possibly by inhibiting NLRP3-induced neuro-inflammation in the hippocampus, and that BHB may be a 
novel therapeutic candidate for the treatment of stress-related mood disorders.
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by depressed mood, anhedonia, low self-esteem, loss of moti-
vation, sleep disruption, loss of appetite, and other cognitive symptoms1. Approximately 33% of patients with 
depression exhibit little or no improvement when treated with existing typical antidepressants, which commonly 
act on the monoaminergic systems2. Therefore, there is a need to develop novel treatments for depression.
Recent evidence has suggested that pro-inflammatory cytokines play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of 
MDD3, and that blood levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β
 (IL-1β
), interleukin-6 (IL-
6), and tumor necrosis factor-α
 (TNF-α
), are significantly higher in patients with MDD3, 4. Preclinical studies 
have revealed that both stress and IL-1β
 decrease neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus, and that this effect is 
associated with the development of depressive behaviors5. Moreover, inhibition of IL-1β
 by administration of 
IL-1β
 receptor antagonist or IL-1β
 receptor deletion abolishes both the anti-neurogenic and depressive behavioral 
effects of stress5–7.
Recently, we demonstrated that immobilization (IMM) stress elevates extracellular IL-1β
 levels in the adult 
hippocampus, and that antagonism of the purinergic type 2 X7 receptor (P2X7R), which is the upstream target of 
the IL-1β
 production cascade, inhibits the increase in IL-1β
 levels in the hippocampus, and reverses depressive

behaviors induced by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)8. We also revealed that peripheral administration of 
IL-1β
 neutralizing antibody blocks depressive-like behaviors induced by CUS8. These findings indicate that IL-1β
 
plays a critical role in the development of depression, and that inhibition of IL-1β
 may represent a novel therapeu-
tic strategy for the treatment of depression9.
It is well known that activated caspase-1 is responsible for the maturation and release of IL-1β
. 
Pro-caspase-1 undergoes cleavage to activated caspase-1 via the nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat, 
pyrin-domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which is composed of NLRP3, adapter protein 
apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), and pro-caspase-110. NLRP3 is therefore 
a critical factor in the development of neuro-inflammation11, 12. Previously, we demonstrated that IMM stress 
increases the levels of the hippocampal NLRP3 inflammasome8, suggesting a role in the pathophysiology of 
depression.
Recent reports have indicated that beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a ketone body that supports mam-
malian cell metabolism during states of energy deficits, such as fasting or exercise13, 14, reduces NLRP3 
inflammasome-mediated production of IL-1β
15. Research has further revealed that BHB plays a neuroprotective 
function by exerting anti-oxidative effects and improving mitochondrial function16–18. Together, these studies 
support the hypothesis that BHB may produce antidepressant effects via inhibition of NLRP3 and stress-induced 
neuro-inflammation.
In the present study, we used a CUS model of depression and IMM stress to evaluate the potential anti-
depressant and anti-inflammatory effects of BHB. Our results indicate that BHB attenuates stress-induced 
depressive-like behaviors as well as the elevation of IL-1β
 and TNF-α
 in the rodent hippocampus.
Results
Subcutaneous single administration of BHB slightly increases BHB levels in the hippocam-
pus. 
We assessed the concentration of BHB in the hippocampus at 0, 1, 2, and 3 h after subcutaneous single 
administration of BHB. One hour after injection, we observed an increase in BHB levels relative to baseline. 
Subsequently, BHB levels in the hippocampus gradually decreased (Fig. 1).
Depressive- and anxiety-like behavioral effects of CUS are attenuated by BHB administra-
tion. 
We examined the influence of CUS on body weight (BW). At the beginning of the experiment, there 
were no significant differences in BW among the three groups. CUS rats exhibited a decrease in BW gain after the 
second week of the CUS procedure as compared with non-CUS rats, and the reduced BW gain was not affected 
by treatment with BHB (F2.45 = 29.522, p < 0.0001, n = 16) (Fig. 2a). We also tested behavioral responses, and 
found that CUS exposure increased depressive and anxiety-like behaviors measured in the forced swim test 
(FST), sucrose preference test (SPT), novelty suppressed feeding test (NSFT), and elevated plus maze (EPM), and 
that chronic BHB administration attenuated these CUS-induced behaviors. In the FST (F2.45 = 3.242, p = 0.048,

increased at 1 h after administration, after which gradual decreases in hippocampal BHB levels were observed.

n = 16), CUS rats showed a trend toward more time spent immobile over the 6-min test period than rats of the 
non-CUS control group (p = 0.070). Furthermore, BHB administration significantly attenuated CUS-induced 
increases in time spent immobilized (p = 0.018) (Fig. 2b). In the SPT (X2 = 6.484, p = 0.039, n = 14–16), CUS 
tended to reduce the preference for sucrose (although not statistically significantly), while BHB attenuated this 
reduction significantly (p = 0.011) (Fig. 2c). In the NSFT (X2 = 8.892, p = 0.012, n = 16), we observed a trend for 
increased latency to feed in the CUS model rats (although not statistically significantly), while BHB significantly 
reduced the latency to feed (p = 0.002) (Fig. 2d). Time spent in the open arms in the EPM (X2 = 6.139, p = 0.046, 
n = 16) showed that CUS tended to reduce time spent in the open arms (p = 0.086), and this reduction was atten-
uated by BHB administration (p = 0.012) (Fig. 2e). The number of open-arm entries in the EPM (X2 = 6.273, 
p = 0.043, n = 16) also tended to be decreased in the CUS relative to the non-CUS group (p = 0.057). BHB sig-
nificantly attenuated this effect (p = 0.014) (Fig. 2f). There were no statistically significant differences among the

groups in terms of the number of closed-arm entries (F2.45 = 0.348, p = 0.708, n = 16) (Fig. 2g). In summary, 
these results indicated that CUS induces depressive and anxiety-like behavior, and that BHB attenuated these 
effects.
To know how BHB itself affects the behavior, we evaluated behaviors (FST, SPT, NSFT, and EPM) after 3 weeks 
BHB administration without the CUS paradigm as a preliminary analysis. BHB alone did not change or improve 
behaviors in the four behavioral tests relative to the control group (Supplementary Figure 1a–f).
Regulation of IL-1β
, TNF-α
, and IL-10 in the hippocampus by stress and BHB. 
We measured 
levels of IL-1β
 protein (17 kDa) and TNF-α
 (30 kDa) as well as interleukin-10 (IL-10) (18 kDa) in the hippocam-
pus after acute IMM stress or CUS via western blotting. The levels of IL-1β
 were significantly increased in rats 
exposed to IMM stress as compared to control non-stressed rats (t43 = 2.126, p = 0.039, n = 22–23) (Fig. 3a). A 
single dose of subcutaneously administered BHB reduced the hippocampal IL-1β
 levels in IMM-stressed rats 
(t12 = 2.360, p = 0.036, n = 7) (Fig. 3b). We found no change in TNF-α
 levels in the hippocampus at 1 h after 
IMM (t 43 = 0.154, p = 0.878, n = 22–23) (Fig. 3c). However, subcutaneous administration of a single dose of 
BHB significantly reduced hippocampal TNF-α
 levels at 1 h after IMM (t12 = 2.487, p = 0.029, n = 7) (Fig. 3d). 
IMM did not change the levels of IL-10 (t43 = 0.375, p = 0.709, n = 22–23) (Fig. 3e); moreover, BHB administra-
tion did not alter the levels of IL-10 (t10 = 0.323, p = 0.753, n = 5–7) (Fig. 3f). Neither IMM nor BHB administra-
tion altered the levels of β
-actin in the hippocampus (data not shown).
We also evaluated the levels of cytokines (IL-1β
, TNF-α
, and IL-10) in the hippocampus after BHB adminis-
tration, without any acute stress (without an immobilization stress). The result showed that BHB alone did not 
result in any change in cytokine levels relative to the control group (PBS) (Supplementary Figure 1g–i).
Next, we measured the levels of IL-1β
, TNF-α
 and IL-10 in the hippocampus after CUS. Although chronic 
BHB administration did not alter the levels of IL-1β
 (t15 = 0.205, p = 0.840, n = 8–9) and IL-10 (t15 = 0.831, 
p = 0.419, n = 8–9) after 6 weeks of CUS (Fig. 4a and c), chronic BHB administration significantly decreased 
levels of TNF-α
 in the hippocampus after CUS (t 15 = 2.396, p = 0.030, n = 8–9) (Fig. 4b). Chronic BHB admin-
istration did not alter levels of β
-actin in the hippocampus (data not shown).
We also found that exposure to 1 h of IMM stress markedly elevated serum corticosterone levels (t8 = 14.37, 
p < 0.0001, n = 5) (Fig. 5a), but pretreatment with BHB significantly reduced this effect (t12 = 2.380, p = 0.035, 
n = 7) (Fig. 5b). The result showed that BHB alone did not change serum corticosterone level relative to the con-
trol group (PBS) (Supplementary Figure 1j).
Discussion
In the present study, we observed that BHB administration produced antidepressant-like effects in a rat model 
of CUS-induced depression. We also examined the influence of BHB on hippocampal inflammation induced 
by acute or chronic stress, and found that BHB attenuated stress-induced increases in IL-1β
 and TNF-α
 in the 
hippocampus. The present study provided new evidence that BHB exerts antidepressant-like effects likely by 
inhibiting stress-induced increases in the levels of IL-1β
 and TNF-α
.
BHB is a ketone body synthesized in the liver of mammals, which serves as an alternative energy source for 
the brain during physiological states characterized by limited carbohydrate and surplus fatty acid availability13, 14. 
Some basic research has suggested that BHB may have a beneficial effect in various neurodegenerative condi-
tions, such as Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease, by preventing striatal histone 
deacetylation, improving mitochondrial respiration, and inhibiting amyloid-β
 aggregation and brain atrophy16–18. 
Furthermore, intravenous administration of BHB protects the rat brain against damage caused by focal cerebral 
ischemia, possibly by decreasing oxygen radical production19. These lines of evidence suggest that BHB may exert 
neuroprotective effects in several diseases of the central nervous system.
Moreover, basic research studies have reported that BHB displays anti-inflammatory effects via inhibition of 
the NLRP3 inflammasome. BHB suppresses lipopolysaccharide-induced IL-1β
 elevation in BV-2 cells by inhibit-
ing nuclear factor-kappa B activation20. BHB also suppresses activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and reduces 
NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1β
 and interleukin 18 (IL-18) production in human monocytes and in 
mouse models of NLRP3-mediated diseases, such as Muckle–Wells syndrome15. BHB deactivates the neutrophil 
NLRP3 inflammasome, relieving gout flares21. Qian et al. reported that BHB suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome 
activation and promotes functional recovery in mice with spinal cord injury22. These findings indicate that BHB 
inhibits activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in suppression of IL-1β
 during cerebral infection, 
ischemia, and psychological stress.
As some research has indicated that peripheral BHB crosses the blood–brain barrier, we first examined 
whether peripherally administered BHB could indeed enter the brain, and determined the optimum injection 
timing of BHB for the subsequent experiments (Fig. 1)23. BHB levels increased in the hippocampus at 1 h after 
BHB administration, in accordance with the findings of a previous report on the effect of intragastric administra-
tion of a BHB methyl ester18, although the increase in BHB in the present study was comparatively smaller. This 
difference in BHB levels may be due to differences in the route or dose of administration. In the present study, 
although the extent of the BHB increase was small, our results indicated that peripherally administered BHB 
indeed enters the brain.
We then evaluated the antidepressant-like effects of BHB using a CUS procedure similar to that used in our 
previous studies8, 24. The CUS paradigm is an animal model of depression with high face, construct, and predictive 
validity25–27. We confirmed that rats exposed to CUS exhibited depressive behavioral changes (Fig. 2b–f). These 
behavioral changes are considered to be evidence of despair, anhedonia, and anxiety in rodents28–31. Moreover, 
our results indicate that chronic BHB administration prevents the development of these CUS-induced behaviors, 
which is regarded as a characteristic feature of antidepressant drugs (Fig. 2b–f)32. Although there have been no 
previous reports indicating that BHB produces antidepressant-like effects, there is some evidence suggesting that

a ketogenic diet – which elevates levels of BHB in the brain – may be associated with antidepressant effects. For 
example, it has been reported that a ketogenic diet decreases the time spent immobile in the FST33, while another 
report demonstrated that adult offspring exposed to a prenatal ketogenic diet exhibited reduced susceptibility to 
anxiety and depression34.
We also found that acute stress elevates IL-1β
 levels in the hippocampus (Fig. 3a), consistent with our pre-
vious report8, and that peripheral BHB administration attenuates this effect (Fig. 3b). Our previous findings 
had indicated that stress activates NLRP3 and releases IL-1β
 and TNF-α
, and injection of BHB, which is an 
endogenic NLRP3 inhibitor, is thought to ameliorate the production of these proinflammatory cytokines8. IL-1β
 
is a pro-inflammatory cytokine and a key mediator of a variety of behavioral actions associated with stress9.

Moreover, accumulating evidence has suggested that inhibition of IL-1β
 exerts antidepressant-like effects. 
Infusion of IL-1β
 decreases neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus and causes depressive behavior, while admin-
istration of an IL-1β
 receptor antagonist blocks CUS-induced decreases in neurogenesis and reduces anhedonic 
behavior5. Furthermore, IL-1 receptor-null mutant mice exhibit decreased anhedonic and anxiety-like behav-
ior5, 7. Additionally, some clinical studies have suggested that pro-inflammatory cytokines play a crucial role in 
the pathophysiology of MDD35. Serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β
, are increased in 
patients with MDD3, 4, and these effects are normalized after antidepressant treatment36. Increased levels of IL-1β
 
have also been observed in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with MDD37. Although blockade of IL-1β
 is a viable 
therapeutic target for the treatment of depression, this approach faces several problems, such as the risk of serious 
infections due to systemic inhibition of IL-1β
9.
The NLRP3 inflammasome is composed of NLRP3, adapter protein ASC, and pro-caspase-1. NLRP3 is a 
member of the NLR family of cytosolic pattern-recognition receptors. Resident microglia express NLRP3 in the 
central nervous system38. When NLRP3 detects various danger signals, it is activated to form the inflammasome, 
which cleaves pro-caspase-1 to mature caspase-1, which in turn cleaves pro-IL-1β
 to mature IL-1β
10. One clinical 
study has reported increased gene expression of NLRP3 in mononuclear blood cells and increased levels of serum 
IL-1β
 and IL-18 in patients with pharmacologically untreated MDD. Interestingly, both of these effects were 
reversed by treatment with amitriptyline39. These results indicate an association between depression and levels of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines via NLRP3.
Recently, we demonstrated that psychological stress elevates extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), 
IL-1β
, and TNF-α
 levels, and activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in the adult hippocampus8. The P2X7 R, an 
ATP receptor on microglia, is required for activation of the inflammasome and processing of IL-1β
. Pretreatment 
with a P2X7 R antagonist inhibited these changes, and chronic administration of a P2X7 R antagonist exerted an 
antidepressant effect. These results indicate that stress-induced P2X7 R stimulation increases levels of the active 
form of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex, which cleaves and releases IL-1β
, and subsequently releases TNF-α
, 
resulting in the development of depression8. Based on this evidence, we propose that NLRP3 inflammasome 
activation plays a critical role in stress-induced neuro-inflammation and depression, and that inhibition of the 
NLRP3 inflammasome may have antidepressant effects11, 12. Our present study supports this hypothesis and sug-
gests that BHB, which is an endogenous NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor, may exert antidepressant effects via 
inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome under conditions of stress.
Furthermore, we found that both single-dose and chronic BHB treatment reduced TNF-α
 levels in the hip-
pocampus (Figs 3d and 4b). TNF-α
 is not directly regulated by the NLRP3 inflammasome. However, our previous 
study revealed that acute stress increases hippocampal TNF-α
 levels with a brief time lag after elevation of IL-1β
, 
and pretreatment with a P2X7 R antagonist blocks these responses, suggesting that IL-1β
 stimulates the release of 
TNF-α
8. TNF-α
 is known to have an anti-neurogenic effect and to induce depression-like behavior40. Together, 
these findings suggest that BHB attenuates TNF-α
 levels indirectly through inhibition of the IL-1β
 cytokine cas-
cade, and that this could contribute to the antidepressant actions of BHB.
BHB failed to reduce IL-1β
 levels after the CUS exposure (Fig. 4a). This result is consistent with those of our 
previous study, which showed that IL-1β
 increases only immediately after exposure to a stressor, and then imme-
diately returns to basal levels; thus we may not be able to detect IL-1β
 changes in the absence of acute stress8. On 
the other hand, we observed a decrease in TNF-α
 levels after treatment with BHB in the CUS group (Fig. 4b). This 
may also be consistent with the findings of our previous study that showed that the increase of TNF-α
 lasts longer, 
so that changes in TNF-α
 levels remain detectable for a longer period8. A meta-analysis of clinical studies report-
ing that TNF-α
 levels are consistently increased in MDD patients4 is consistent with our findings of a reduction 
of TNF-α
 levels in CUS rats that had been treated with BHB.
We also demonstrated that BHB partly attenuates the IMM stress-induced increase of serum corticoster-
one levels (Fig. 5a and b). IL-1β
 increases the release of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), 
secretion of pituitary adenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and adrenal steroidogenesis11, 41–43. Sustained levels 
of glucocorticoids can cause atrophy of the pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus, and thereby contribute to 
depressive symptoms11, 44. Thus, it is possible that a decrease in the stress-induced levels of corticosterone contrib-
utes to attenuation of stress-induced depressive behaviors as observed in the present study.
There are some limitations in the present study. Although we demonstrated the antidepressant-like effects of 
BHB, the treatment paradigm used shows a preventative action, rather than reversal of the CUS effects. Further 
studies are required to assess the therapeutic efficacy of BHB in animal models of depression. In addition, we 
did not evaluate how BHB affects the NLRP3 inflammasome under conditions of stress. Therefore, it remains 
unclear whether BHB reduces stress-induced increases in IL-1β
 via inhibition of NLRP3. Furthermore, although 
the behaviors of rats exposed to CUS tended toward depression, we failed to demonstrate statistically significant 
depressive behavior in some tests in the CUS model, even though we used similar stressors as in previous stud-
ies27, and a relatively large number of animals per group (n = 16). It is also worth noting that the extent of BHB 
increase in the brains of animals in the present study was small in comparison to that reported in a previous 
neuroprotective study in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease18. Nevertheless, our findings successfully demon-
strated the anti-inflammatory effect of BHB after subcutaneous administration of a single dose. Also, because the 
levels of IL-1β
 and TNF-α
 in the hippocampus were significantly suppressed by BHB, that small increase appears 
to be physiologically relevant. Thus, it is possible that a single dose of BHB may produce a slight increase in brain 
levels of BHB, which may be sufficient to improve symptoms of depression. However, further studies are required 
to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the antidepressant and anti-inflammatory effects of BHB in mouse mod-
els of depression.

Conclusion
The findings of the present study demonstrate that BHB treatment exerts antidepressant-like effects in a 
CUS-induced rat model of depression, and that BHB attenuates stress-induced increases in hippocam-
pal levels of IL-1β
. As IL-1β
, which is thought to be tightly regulated by NLRP3 inflammasome, plays a criti-
cal role in stress-induced neuro-inflammation and in the development of depressive states, BHB may exert its 
antidepressant-like effects via blockade of NLRP3-induced increases in hippocampal levels of IL-1β
. BHB is an 
endogenic NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor, which is thought to be a safe and versatile physiologically active sub-
stance and therefore has some advantages for clinical applications. These results are critical for the development 
of new pharmacotherapeutic approaches that target neuro-inflammation in MDD.
Method
Animals and housing. 
Male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats with initial weights of 310–370 g (9–10-weeks-old) 
were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Yokohama, Japan). Animals were housed three rats per cage 
under a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on from 7:30 am to 7:30 pm) at a constant temperature (25 °C), with free 
access to food and water, except during exposure to CUS, and were allowed to acclimate to the housing envi-
ronment for 7 days. Behavioral testing was conducted between 10:00 am and 4:00 pm, with the exception of the 
sucrose preference test. All experimental procedures involving animals were conducted in accordance with the 
Institutional Animal Care Guidelines and approved ethically by the Tottori University Animal Care and Use 
Committee (approval number 14-Y-33). All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering.
Experimental design. 
Experimental procedures are described in Fig. 6. To determine the optimum timing 
for BHB injection, 16 rats (four rats in each group) were used for the measurement of hippocampal BHB concen-
trations. BHB was subcutaneously administered at a dosage of 250 mg/kg. Rats were then sacrificed for sample 
collection at 0 (pre-injection), 1, 2, and 3 h after BHB injection (Fig. 6a). Next, to evaluate the effect of BHB for 
the animal model of depression, rats were divided into three groups of 16 each for the chronic stress experiment, 
as follows: non CUS + phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), CUS + PBS, and CUS + BHB (PBS or BHB was injected 
subcutaneously just before each stressor, twice a day). After 4 weeks of CUS, behavioral tests were performed while 
continuing CUS (Fig. 6b). After a total of 6 weeks of CUS, rats were sacrificed and the levels of IL-1β
, TNF-α
, and 
IL-10 were measured. Tissue collection was done 12 h after administration of the last stressor of the CUS paradigm 
was completed. To elucidate the effects of acute stress (IMM) on pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, rats were 
sacrificed after 1 h of IMM and the levels of cytokines and corticosterone were measured (Fig. 6c). Additionally, to 
evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of BHB, PBS or BHB were injected 1 h prior to IMM. Rats were sacrificed 
after 1 h of IMM stress and the cytokine and corticosterone levels were measured (Fig. 6d).
Drugs and reagents. 
DL-BHB (Tokyo Chemical Industry, Tokyo, Japan) was dissolved in PBS (NaCl 
137 mM, KCl 2.7 mM, Na2HPO4·12H2O 8.1 mM, KH2PO4 1.47 mM, pH 7.5) to a concentration of 150 mg/mL 
and adjusted to a pH of 7.5.
Measurement of hippocampal BHB concentration. 
The brains were rinsed with PBS to remove any 
red blood cells or clots. Rat hippocampus was dissected on ice, and the samples were immediately frozen at 
−
80 °C until required for use. Tissue samples were homogenized with β
-HB Assay Buffer (Item No. 700191, 
Cayman Co Ltd, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and centrifuged at 10,000 ×
 g to obtain the supernatant. The concentra-
tions of BHB in the supernatant were assayed using the BHB assay kit (Item No. 700190, Cayman Co Ltd) accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Chronic unpredictable stress procedure. 
We utilized a CUS procedure to create a rodent model of 
depression. Rats were exposed to two variable sequences of unpredictable stressors per day, both in the daytime 
and at night. The stressors included cage tilt (45°, overnight), lights off during the daytime, lights on overnight, 
crowding (eight rats per cage, overnight), cold stress (20 min, daytime), small cages (cage for mice, overnight or 
during the daytime), cage rotation (1 h, daytime), immobilization stress (1 h, daytime), wet bedding (overnight 
or during the daytime), isolation (overnight), and food and water deprivation (24 h), followed by empty water 
bottle replacement (4 h). These stressors were randomly scheduled throughout the 4-week experiment. Control 
rats were handled every day without CUS.
Immobilization Stress. 
We utilized the IMM method to induce acute stress. Rats were restrained using 
conical plastic film tubes for 1 h.
Behavioral testing. 
Forced swim test. A single session of the FST was conducted as previously described45. 
Rats were forced to swim individually in a plastic bucket (32 cm ×
 47 cm) filled with water (24 °C, 34 cm depth) for 
6 min. Tests were recorded on videotape and later scored by an observer who was blinded to the animal groups. 
The cumulative time spent in immobile posturing (floating in the water with only movements necessary to keep 
the nose above the surface) was recorded. The water was changed after each trial.
Sucrose preference test. Animals were acclimated to 1% sucrose for 48 h (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., 
Osaka, Japan). One week later, preference for 1% sucrose or water was determined over an 8-h period (overnight). 
The preference for sucrose was calculated as (mL sucrose/mL total consumed) ×
 100.
Novelty-suppressed feeding test. The NSFT was conducted as previously described8. After 24 h of food deprivation, 
the NSFT was performed in an open field (90 cm ×
 90 cm ×
 45 cm), and the latency to feed was recorded, up to a max-
imum of 20 min. The open field was cleaned after each trial, and all tests were conducted under dimly lit conditions.

Elevated plus maze test. The elevated plus maze consisted of two open arms (50 cm ×
 10 cm) and two closed 
arms (50 cm ×
 10 cm; 30-cm high walls) arranged such that the two open arms were opposite each other. The 
maze was elevated to a height of 50 cm. Rats were gently placed in the closed arm and were allowed to explore the 
maze for 5 min. The total time spent in each arm as well as the number of entries into each arm was recorded. The 
maze was cleaned after each trial. The test was conducted under dimly lit conditions.
Measurement of IL-1β
 in the hippocampus. 
We measured hippocampal levels of IL-1β
 by western 
blotting. The frozen hippocampal tissue samples were homogenized in ice-cold buffer (320 mM sucrose, 20 mM 
HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, 1.25 mM NaF, and 1 mM NaVO3) containing protease inhibitor (cOmplete® Cocktail tab-
lets, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). The samples were then centrifuged at 500 ×
 g for 1 min at 
4 °C to remove debris, and supernatant was collected. Supernatant was centrifuged at 12,000 ×
 g for 10 minutes 
at 4 °C, after which the supernatant was again collected. Total protein concentrations were determined using the 
bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit (Pierce® BCA Protein Assay Kit, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA).
Protein samples were separated using 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Nonspecific protein-binding sites were blocked with Tris-buffered 
Figure 6. Experimental procedures. (a) The procedure for measurement of hippocampal BHB concentration 
is shown. In each group, four rats were treated with 250 mg/kg BHB subcutaneously, and were then sacrificed 
for sample collection at 1, 2, and 3 h after BHB injection. (b) Schematic representation of the CUS experimental 
procedure and behavioral tests. Three groups were studied: non-CUS + PBS, CUS + PBS, and CUS + BHB, 
n = 16 per group. Rats were exposed to two variable sequences of unpredictable stressors per day in the daytime 
and night. All rats were administered PBS or BHB (250 mg/kg) subcutaneously, twice a day. Behavioral tests 
were conducted after 4 weeks of CUS. (c) The experimental paradigm for IMM stress is shown. Rats were 
sacrificed after exposure to 1 h of stress, and the brain and blood were collected. (d) The experimental paradigm 
for pretreatment and IMM stress is shown. PBS or BHB was subcutaneously administered 1 h prior to IMM, and 
rats were sacrificed after 1 h of IMM stress, and the brain and blood were collected. CUS: chronic unpredictable 
stress, PBS: phosphate buffered saline, BHB: beta-hydroxybutyrate, IMM: immobilization stress, Sac: sacrifice,

saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST, Tris-HCl 20 mM, NaCl 102 mM, pH 7.0) and 1% bovine serum albumin 
for 30 min, at room temperature (20–25 °C), and incubated with primary antibodies for IL-1β
 (ab9722; 1:2500 
dilution, i.e., 0.2 μ
g/mL, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) diluted into TBST at 4 °C overnight. After 20 min of 
washing with TBST (three times), membranes were incubated with a secondary antibody to rabbit (ab16284; 
1:10000, i.e., 0.1 μ
g/mL, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) diluted into TBST at room temperature for 1 h. After 
20 min of washing (three times), western blot bands were visualized by incubation with a chemiluminescent 
substrate (ECL Select Western Blotting Detection Reagent, GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK), and the mem-
branes were scanned using an imager (AE-6981 Light CaptureII 130W, ATTO CORPORATION, Tokyo, Japan). 
Densitometric analysis of western blot bands was performed using software ImageJ Version 1.51 (National 
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Membranes were stripped and re-probed with primary antibodies 
against β
-actin (A1978; 1:4000 dilution; i.e., 0.5 μ
g/mL, Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and secondary anti-
body for mouse (ab97023; 1:10000 dilution; i.e., 0.1 μ
g/mL; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA).
Measurement of TNF-α
 and IL-10 in the hippocampus. 
Hippocampal TNF-α
 and IL-10 levels were 
measured via western blotting. Western blotting was performed as mentioned above, but without a blocking step. 
Primary antibodies for TNF-α
 (AB1837P; 1:2500, i.e., 0.2 μ
g/mL, Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) and 
for IL-10 (ab9969; 1:10000 dilution; i.e., 0.1 μ
g/mL; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), and secondary antibody for 
rabbit (ab16284 1:10000 = 0.1 μ
g/mL, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) were used.
Serum corticosterone measurement. 
The blood was collected after 1 h of acute immobilization stress. 
The blood was stored at 4 °C overnight. The supernatant was collected, and then the serum corticosterone level 
was measured by the CLEIA method, in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche Diagnostics 
K.K, Tokyo, Japan).
Statistical analyses. 
All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS Statistics 19.0 (Tokyo, Japan). Data 
were analyzed using unpaired, two-tailed t-tests. For comparisons among the three groups, analyses of variance 
were conducted, followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test. Some behavioral data (SPT, NSFT, time spent in open arms 
in the EPM, and number of entries into the open arms in the EPM) were not normally distributed based on 
the Shapiro–Wilk test. Therefore, we used the Kruskal–Wallis test and Mann–Whitney U test for comparisons 
between those groups. As previously described8, values were excluded from analysis if they were greater than two 
standard deviations (SD) from the mean. The data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). 
p-values < 0.05 were considered significant.
