Environment With Prevalence of Neighborhood Adult Obesity
Adyasha Maharana, MS; Elaine Okanyene Nsoesie, PhD
Abstract
IMPORTANCE More than one-third of the adult population in the United States is obese. Obesity
has been linked to factors such as genetics, diet, physical activity, and the environment. However,
evidence indicating associations between the built environment and obesity has varied across
studies and geographical contexts.
OBJECTIVE To propose an approach for consistent measurement of the features of the built
environment (ie, both natural and modified elements of the physical environment) and its
association with obesity prevalence to allow for comparison across studies.
DESIGN The cross-sectional study was conducted from February 14 through October 31, 2017. A
convolutional neural network, a deep learning approach, was applied to approximately 150 000
high-resolution satellite images from Google Static Maps API (application programing interface) to
extract features of the built environment in Los Angeles, California; Memphis, Tennessee; San
Antonio, Texas; and Seattle (representing Seattle, Tacoma, and Bellevue), Washington. Data on adult
obesity prevalence were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’
s 500 Cities
project. Regression models were used to quantify the association between the features and obesity
prevalence across census tracts.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Model-estimated obesity prevalence (obesity defined as body
mass index �30, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) based on
built environment information.
RESULTS The study included 1695 census tracts in 6 cities. The age-adjusted obesity prevalence was
18.8% (95% CI, 18.6%-18.9%) for Bellevue, 22.4% (95% CI, 22.3%-22.5%) for Seattle, 30.8% (95%
CI, 30.6%-31.0%) for Tacoma, 26.7% (95% CI, 26.7%-26.8%) for Los Angeles, 36.3% (95% CI,
36.2%-36.5%) for Memphis, and 32.9% (95% CI, 32.8%-32.9%) for San Antonio. Features of the
built environment explained 64.8% (root mean square error [RMSE], 4.3) of the variation in obesity
prevalence across all census tracts. Individually, the variation explained was 55.8% (RMSE, 3.2) for
Seattle (213 census tracts), 56.1% (RMSE, 4.2) for Los Angeles (993 census tracts), 73.3%
(RMSE, 4.5) for Memphis (178 census tracts), and 61.5% (RMSE, 3.5) for San Antonio (311
census tracts).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study illustrates that convolutional neural networks can be
used to automate the extraction of features of the built environment from satellite images for
studying health indicators. Understanding the association between specific features of the built
environment and obesity prevalence can lead to structural changes that could encourage physical
activity and decreases in obesity prevalence.

Key Points
Question How can convolutional neural
networks assist in the study of the
association between the built
environment and obesity prevalence?
Findings In this cross-sectional
modeling study of 4 US urban areas,
extraction of built environment (ie, both
natural and modified elements of the
physical environment) information from
images using convolutional neural
networks and use of that information to
assess associations between the built
environment and obesity prevalence
showed that physical characteristics of a
neighborhood (eg, the presence of
parks, highways, green streets,
crosswalks, diverse housing types) can
be associated with variations in obesity
prevalence across different
neighborhoods.

 Introduction
The Global Burden of Disease study estimates that more than 603 million adults worldwide were
obese in 2015.1 In the United States, more than one-third of the adult population is obese,2-4 and 46
states have an estimated adult obesity rate of 25% or more.5 Obesity is a complex health issue that
has been linked to a myriad of factors, including genetics, demographics, and behavior.6 Behavioral
traits that encourage unhealthy food choices and a sedentary lifestyle have been associated with
features in the social and built environment (ie, both natural and modified elements of the physical
environment). The built environment can influence health through the availability of resources, such
as housing, activity and recreational spaces, and measures of community design.7
Studies8-26 have shown that certain features of the built environment can be associated with
obesity and physical activity across different life stages. Research also supports the association
between obesity and environmental factors, including walkability, land use, sprawl, area of residence,
access to resources (eg, recreational facilities and food outlets), level of deprivation, and perceived
safety.27-30 Proximity and access to natural spaces and sidewalks can lead to increased and regular
physical activity, especially in urban areas.31-35
Despite these associations between obesity and the built environment, inconsistencies have
been noted across studies and geographic contexts on the association between specific features of
the built environment and obesity prevalence.28,36-38 These inconsistencies could be due to
variations in measures and measurement tools across studies, making it difficult to assess and
compare findings.29 Furthermore, the process of measuring these features can be costly, time-
consuming, and subject to human judgment and bias. Approaches that enable consistent
measurement and allow for comparison across studies are needed. Assessing and quantifying the
association of the built environment with obesity would be useful for selecting and implementing
appropriate community-based interventions and prevention efforts.4,29
Herein, we propose a method for comprehensively assessing the association between adult
obesity prevalence and the built environment that involves extracting neighborhood physical
features from high-resolution satellite imagery using a previously trained (hereafter termed
pretrained) convolutional neural network (CNN), a deep learning approach. Nguyen et al39 used
CNNs to classify images of the built environment from Google’
s Street View to assess the association
between obesity and the presence of crosswalks, building types, and street greenness or
landscaping. However, their study did not take full advantage of CNNs for independently discovering
features that can be associated with obesity prevalence and was limited to 3 predetermined features.
In contrast, we comprehensively assess features in the built environment and demonstrate our
approach by providing fine-grained associations with obesity prevalence at the census tract level for
4 US regions. Our approach is also scalable and relies on openly available data and computational
tools and can enable comparability across studies.
Methods
Obesity Prevalence Data
We used 2014 estimates of annual crude obesity prevalence at the census tract level from the 500
Cities project.2,40,41 These estimates were computed from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
System data, wherein the survey respondents are 18 years or older and the body mass index (BMI;
calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) threshold for obesity is 30. We
selected cities from states with high (Tennessee and Texas) and low (Washington and California)
prevalence of obesity.5 The 6 cities selected included Los Angeles, California; Memphis, Tennessee;
San Antonio, Texas; and Seattle, Tacoma, and Bellevue, Washington. Because Seattle, Tacoma, and
Bellevue are neighboring cities with few census tracts, we combined their data into a single data set,
hereinafter referred to as Seattle. The study was exempt from institutional review board approval
because the research involved the study of existing data and records collected by external parties in

 such a manner that individuals cannot be identified. This study followed the Strengthening the
Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline where applicable.
The analysis consisted of 2 steps. First, we processed satellite images to extract features of the
built environment using the CNN and extracted and processed point-of-interest (POI) data. Second,
we used elastic net regression to build a parsimonious model to assess the association between the
built environment and obesity prevalence.
Acquiring Satellite Imagery and POI Data
We downloaded images from Google Static Maps API (application programing interface) by providing
the geographic center, image dimensions, and zoom level for each image. The zoom level and image
dimensions were set to 18 and 400 × 400 pixels, respectively, for the entire data set. For each city,
we divided its geographic span into a square grid, where each point is a pair of latitude and longitude
values and the grid spacing is approximately 150 m. Further, we used census tract shapefiles to
associate each image with its respective census tract and excluded images that were from areas
outside the city limits. We used the same square grid to select geographic locations and performed a
radial nearby search within an appropriate distance to download POI data through the Google Places
of Interest API. Points of interest that were located outside city limits were excluded. We collected
a set of 96 unique POI categories, and for each census tract we counted the number of locations
associated with each category (eTable 1 in the Supplement). All POI data and satellite images were
initially downloaded from February 14 through 28, 2017, and updated during the study period, which
lasted through October 31, 2017. Satellite images downloaded through the API are only marked with
the date of download represented by a time stamp and watermark at the bottom.
Image Processing
Convolutional neural networks have achieved groundbreaking success with large data sets in critical
computer vision tasks (eg, object recognition, image segmentation) as well as health-related
applications (eg, recognition of skin cancer)42 and estimating poverty.43 Owing to the lack of a large
labeled data set for classifying high- and low-obesity regions, we adopted a transfer learning
approach (eFigures 1 and 2 in the Supplement), which involves using a pretrained network to extract
features of the built environment from our unlabeled data set of nearly 150 000 satellite images.
Transfer learning involves fine-tuning the pretrained CNN for a new task (with modification to the
output layer) or using the pretrained CNN as a fixed feature extractor combined with linear classifiers
or regression models. These approaches have been successfully implemented to perform computer
vision tasks that are markedly different from object recognition.44
We used the VGG-CNN-F network,45 which is composed of 8 layers (5 convolutional and 3 fully
connected) and is trained on approximately 1.2 million images from the ImageNet database (a data
set of >14 million images used for large-scale visual recognition challenges)46 for recognizing objects
belonging to 1000 categories.47 The network learns to extract gradients, edges, and patterns that
aid in object detection. Studies using similar transfer learning approaches48,49 have shown that
features extracted from networks trained on the ImageNet data are effective at classifying aerial
imagery into fine-grained semantic classes of land use (eg, golf courses, bridges, parking lots,
buildings, and roads).
We collected outputs from the second fully connected layer of the network for each image in
our data set.45,50 The second fully connected layer has 4096 nodes, each of which has nonlinear
connections with all other nodes in the previous and next layers. Each feature vector has 4096
dimensions, corresponding to the output (also termed activations) from these nodes. These outputs
were further aggregated into mean feature vectors for each census tract by computing the mean
from all images belonging to a census tract. We do not link these features to specific elements in the
built environment. Rather, these features collectively represent an indicator of the built
environment. To investigate whether the CNN can differentiate between built environment features,
we made a forward pass through the network for a randomly selected set of images and examined

 the output maps from convolutional layers of the CNN (Figure 1). We also group image features to
illustrate that built environment characteristics in areas with low and high obesity prevalence are
distinct (eFigure 3 in the Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
We applied Elastic Net,51 a regularized regression method that eliminates insignificant covariates,
preserves correlated variables, and is well suited to the high-dimensional (n = 4096) feature vectors
extracted from our image data set. Regularization in Elastic Net guards against overfitting, which is
a concern given the high dimensionality of our feature data set. To select an appropriate value for the
tuning parameter (λ value), we used cross-validation and selected the value that minimized the mean
cross-validated error.
We performed 5-fold cross-validated regression analyses to quantify the following associations:
(1) between features of built environment and prevalence of obesity at the census tract level, (2)

 between density of POIs and prevalence of obesity at the census tract level, and (3) between features
of built environment and per capita income obtained from the American Community Survey 2014
five-year estimates at the census tract level (eTable 2 in the Supplement).52 We also split the data into
2 random samples, using 1 sample representing 60% of the data in model fitting and the remaining
40% in validation across all analysis. These analyses were performed jointly for all regions and
independently for each region. Additional details are available in eMethods in the Supplement.
Results
We included 1695 census tracts from the 6 cities. Based on 2010 census data, individuals 18 years and
older constituted 78.8% (n = 96 410) of the population of Bellevue, 84.6% (n = 515 147) of the
population of Seattle, 77.0% (n = 152 760) of the population of Tacoma, 76.9% (n = 2 918 096) of
the population of Los Angeles, 74.0% (n = 478 921) of the population of Memphis, and 73.2%
(n = 971 407) of the population of San Antonio. The per capita income varied across these cities, with
cities such as Bellevue and Seattle having much higher values. Specifically, the corresponding values
in US dollars obtained from the American Community Survey 2014 five-year estimates were $50 405
for Bellevue, $44 167 for Seattle, $26 805 for Tacoma, $28 320 for Los Angeles, $21 909 for
Memphis, and $22 784 for San Antonio. The cities with the highest per capita income also had the
lowest city-level age-adjusted obesity prevalence estimates, at 18.8% (95% CI, 18.6%-18.9%), and
22.4% (95% CI, 22.3%-22.5%), respectively, for Bellevue and Seattle. In contrast, the age-adjusted
obesity prevalence was 30.8% (95% CI, 30.6%-31.0%) for Tacoma, 26.7% (95% CI, 26.7%-26.8%)
for Los Angeles, 36.3% (95% CI, 36.2%-36.5%) for Memphis, and 32.9% (95% CI, 32.8%-32.9%) for
San Antonio.
Visualization of the outputs from the convolutional layers of the VGG-CNN-F suggests that our
model learns to identify features of the environment that have been associated with obesity from the
satellite images. Specifically, the CNN captured gradients and edges corresponding to the presence
of roads, buildings, trees, water, and land (Figure 1). After regularization, we retained 125 features for
all cities combined, 157 for Los Angeles, 79 for Memphis, 69 for San Antonio, and 85 for Seattle.
These features of the built environment explained 64.8% (root mean square error [RMSE], 4.3) of
the variation in obesity prevalence in out-of-sample estimates across all 1695 census tracts based on
the elastic net regression. Individually, our models explained 55.8% (RMSE, 3.2) of the variation in
obesity prevalence for Seattle (213 census tracts), 56.1% (RMSE, 4.2) for Los Angeles (993 census
tracts), 73.3% (RMSE, 4.5) for Memphis (178 census tracts), and 61.5% (RMSE, 3.5) for San Antonio
(311 census tracts) in out-of-sample estimates (Figure 2 and Figure 3 and eFigures 4-11 in the
Supplement). Our approach consistently presents a strong association between obesity prevalence
and the built environment indicator across all 4 regions, despite varying city and neighborhood
values. These high associations between features of the built environment and obesity were
achieved without labeling the satellite images or fine-tuning the CNN model to differentiate between
images from neighborhoods with high vs low prevalence of obesity.
Compared with the features of the built environment, the POI data explained 42.4%
(RMSE, 4.3) of the variation in obesity prevalence across all 1695 census tracts in out-of-sample
estimates. The variation explained at the regional level was approximately 14.0% (RMSE, 4.5) for the
213 Seattle census tracts, 29.2% (RMSE, 5.4) for the 993 Los Angeles census tracts, 43.0%
(RMSE, 4.1) for the 311 San Antonio census tracts, and 43.2% (RMSE, 6.7) for the 178 Memphis census
tracts. We illustrate the linear correlation between the actual obesity prevalence and our model-
estimated prevalence and compare the findings using the image features and POI data in Figure 4
and eFigure 12 in the Supplement.
One possible explanation of the significant associations between the data on the built
environment features and obesity prevalence is that the data might be representative of
socioeconomic indicators such as income. Specifically, the variation in per capita income explained by
the features of the built environment was 37.6% for the 213 Seattle census tracts, 62.1% for the 993

 Los Angeles census tracts, 58.2% for the 311 San Antonio census tracts, and 23.2% for the 178
Memphis census tracts (eFigures 13-16 in the Supplement). These observations suggest that for cities
such as Los Angeles and San Antonio, most of the significant association between obesity prevalence
and the features of the built environment could potentially be explained by variations in
socioeconomic status. This suggestion agrees with a previous study43 that used CNNs and satellite
imagery to assess the association between the built environment and poverty. However, the
inconsistency in the associations across the 4 regions also suggests that features discerned by the
CNN might capture additional information not directly linked to socioeconomic indicators.

 Discussion
In this study, we used a CNN, a deep learning approach, to extract data representing features of the
built environment from high-resolution satellite images to examine the association between the built
environment and the prevalence of obesity across 4 regions. The CNN features capture different
aspects of the environment, such as greenery and different housing types, that have been associated
with physical activity and obesity. Our results demonstrate a consistent association between the built
environment indicator and obesity prevalence across neighborhoods with low and high prevalence
of adult obesity. A sampling of the satellite images from various census tracts with high and low
prevalence of obesity indicates that these environments have features that have been linked with
low and high prevalence of obesity in other studies. For example, we observe neighborhoods with

 tightly packed houses vs spaced housing (eFigure 11 in the Supplement), neighborhoods close to
roadways vs those with smaller streets and crosswalks (eFigure 9 in the Supplement), neighborhoods
with much vs less greenery (eFigure 7 in the Supplement), and affluent vs poor neighborhoods
(eFigure 5 in the Supplement).
In some instances, our models tended to underestimate obesity prevalence, especially for
Seattle, which could be explained by the presence of green spaces in the region and the low variation
of obesity prevalence across most of the region. Overestimation of obesity prevalence as observed
in some of the high-income census tracts in the east of Memphis could be explained by the presence
of features that do not encourage physical activity; however, individuals can more readily afford gym
memberships and other recreational facilities. These observations therefore suggest that the
features of the built environment can be used in combination with other data sources for monitoring
obesity prevalence, and these data could be useful for regions with delayed updates on obesity
estimates and for programs focused on reducing obesity.
Our study is important for several reasons. First, although the built environment has been
postulated to have an effect on obesity prevalence, studies have produced varying results, partly
because measures of the built environment can be subjective, sometimes relying on participant or
researcher perceptions. Second, in some studies, neighborhood audits of features of the built
environment have heretofore been conducted using costly and time-consuming on-site visits or
neighborhood surveys. The development of data algorithms that can automatically process satellite
images to create indicators of the built environment would dramatically lower the cost and allow for

 investigations of the effect of place characteristics on obesity prevalence. Third, our study presents
strong and consistent evidence suggesting that the built environment may be a significant indicator
of obesity prevalence.
The proportion of variation (R2) in obesity prevalence explained in studies that report this
measure has varied. For example, the percentage of between–census tract variance explained
increased from 77% to 87% when built environment variables were added to a model for BMI
composed of demographic variables.53 However, not all the built environment features (ie, land use
mix, subway density, bus stop density, intersection density) were significant. On adding built
environment variables (including land-use mix, distribution of fast-food outlets, street connectivity,
access to public transportation, and green and open spaces) to a model for overweight and obesity
that included individual and neighborhood level covariates, Li et al54 observed that the model
explained neighborhood-level variation of 0.981. The proportion of variation observed in our
analyses could be owing to the comprehensiveness of our approach and possible confounding
factors such as socioeconomic status. However, although our findings are likely to be explained at
least in part by socioeconomic indicators, such as income, our analyses also suggest that the built
environment features more consistently estimate obesity than per capita income across all regions.
A possible explanation is that the features extracted include man-made changes to the built
environment and natural features (eg, parks and forests) that might not always be indicative or
particularly associated with socioeconomic status.
We also demonstrate that the density of POI can also be associated with variations in obesity
prevalence, but to a lesser extent when compared with results obtained using the data extracted
from satellite images. The POI data displayed higher associations with obesity prevalence for regions
with higher obesity prevalence (ie, San Antonio and Memphis) and less so in regions with lower
obesity prevalence. Furthermore, some of the most significant variables could be directly associated
with health, diet, and exercise (eg, gyms, spas, restaurants, bakeries, supermarkets, bowling alleys),
whereas others might be linked to other neighborhood characteristics (eg, natural features, pet
stores, recreational vehicle parks). Also, strictly restricting the data to POIs associated with health
and exercise resulted in poorer results. Furthermore, the POI data support the results from the
satellite imagery analysis; specifically, both analyses suggest stronger associations between the built
environment and obesity for San Antonio and Memphis compared with Los Angeles and Seattle.
Our findings are relevant to researchers seeking to develop low-cost and timely methods that
allow for direct measurement of the built environment to study its association with obesity and other
health outcomes. All the data and computational methods used in this study are openly available,
allowing for comparisons of study results across regions with varying populations and geographies.
In addition, our results are also relevant to people monitoring obesity prevalence or working to
develop public health programs to decrease obesity. We show that models fitted solely to the
features of the built environment can provide reasonable estimates of neighborhood obesity
prevalence, which are typically delayed from official sources by several years. For this study, we used
obesity prevalence estimates from 2014, because more recent values were unavailable. Ideally,
methods and programs should focus on combining individual- and neighborhood-level data to
provide timely estimates of neighborhood obesity prevalence.
Limitations
This study has some limitations. First, the obesity prevalence estimates from the Behavioral Risk
Factor Surveillance System are based on self-reported height and weight, which have been shown to
be biased and tend to lead to lower estimates of obesity prevalence.55,56 In addition, BMI does not
allow for the direct measurement of body fat, which can vary across sex, age, race, and ethnicity.
Furthermore, mortality and morbidity risk may vary across different race and ethnicities at the same
BMI.57,58 Differences also occur in the timing of the obesity data and the satellite images, which can
introduce bias into our analysis.

 Furthermore, we used a CNN that is trained for object recognition to extract features relevant
to the built environment because of the lack of a labeled data set for high- and low-obesity areas. This
approach puts some restrictions on the interpretability of features used in our model. A CNN trained
to classify land use patterns (eg, the UC [University of California] Merced land use data set59) also
encodes fine-grained information about the built environment. Thus, alternatively, we can use such
a CNN trained on a large land-use data set as a fixed-feature extractor and examine the performance
of these vectors for classifying high- and low-obesity areas. This CNN will allow us to associate land
use patterns with obesity trends and lend greater interpretability to prediction models. However, we
were unable to find openly available networks pretrained on aerial and satellite imagery data sets for
such a task. Google Street View images are a potential resource for capturing community activity
levels at greater precision. For example, presence of persons jogging in the neighborhood might be
an indicator of lower obesity prevalence in the community.
Conclusions
Our study provides evidence of the efficacy of CNNs at associating obesity prevalence with
significant physical environment features and opens possibilities for refining the methods for a more
consistent and useful application. To make our approach useful for public health and community
planning efforts, our future efforts will focus on assessing disparities based on neighborhood racial
composition and socioeconomic status. Socioeconomic status has been linked to obesity and other
health outcomes. For example, Gordon-Larsen et al21 found that lower socioeconomic status blocks
were more likely to have fewer physical activity facilities, and these disparities in access could be
associated with differences in overweight patterns. Review studies focused on the African American
population and disadvantaged populations highlighted a strong association between safety and
physical activity and obesity, especially in urban regions.38,60 This finding could also explain the
associations we noted between police stations and the high obesity prevalence in the POI data.
These populations were also less likely to have access to needed resources and environments
typically associated with lower obesity prevalence. Furthermore, longitudinal studies using our
approach can assess changes in the built environment that may be associated with increases or
decreases in neighborhood obesity prevalence.
Results in this study support the association between features of the built environment and
obesity prevalence. Neighborhood-level interventions to encourage physical activity and increase
access to healthy food outlets could be combined with individual-level interventions to aid in curbing
the obesity epidemic.
