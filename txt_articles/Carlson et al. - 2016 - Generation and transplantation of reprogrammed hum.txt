Cell replacement therapy with human pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons has the potential
to ameliorate neurodegenerative dysfunction and central nervous system injuries, but
reprogrammed neurons are dissociated and spatially disorganized during transplantation,
rendering poor cell survival, functionality and engraftment in vivo. Here, we present the design
of
three-dimensional
(3D)
microtopographic
scaffolds,
using
tunable
electrospun
microfibrous polymeric substrates that promote in situ stem cell neuronal reprogramming,
neural
network
establishment
and
support
neuronal
engraftment
into
the
brain.
Scaffold-supported, reprogrammed neuronal networks were successfully grafted into
organotypic hippocampal brain slices, showing an B3.5-fold improvement in neurite
outgrowth
and
increased
action
potential
firing
relative
to
injected
isolated
cells.
Transplantation of scaffold-supported neuronal networks into mouse brain striatum improved
survival B38-fold at the injection site relative to injected isolated cells, and allowed delivery
of multiple neuronal subtypes. Thus, 3D microscale biomaterials represent a promising
platform for the transplantation of therapeutic human neurons with broad neuro-regenerative
relevance.

 N
eurodegenerative diseases and traumatic brain injuries
result in a loss of functional neurons in the central
nervous system (CNS) and are responsible for substantial
deterioration in quality of life. Although cell transplantation
therapies
have
shown
some
promise
towards
functional
recovery in animal models, the efficacy of these therapies
has been limited by poor cell survival rates1–3. Human induced
pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have recently emerged as a promising
renewable source of expandable patient-specific cells that can be
used to generate human neurons4–6. These iPS cell-derived
neurons are a potentially invaluable tool as a cell source for the
in vivo treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic
CNS injury7,8.
While many neuronal differentiation protocols have been
established, a robust protocol was recently advanced for the
accelerated production of human neuronal cells from iPS cells,
called induced neuronal (iN) cells, by the direct conversion of iPS
cells using ectopic expression of sets (Brn2, Ascl1, Myt1l) or single
transcription factors (Ascl1, NeuroD1 or Ngn2) (refs 9–12).
Direct conversion yields improved conversion efficiency and
accelerates
maturation
relative
to
standard
differentiation
protocols. However, effective approaches to generate these cells
in
three-dimensional
(3D)
configurations
and
to
deliver
these cells therapeutically in vivo have yet to be established.
Cell replacement therapies of matured neurons in the brain have
conventionally been limited to injection of dissociated cells2,13.
An alternative approach using biomaterial scaffolds can provide
structural support to cells during transplantation, which could
improve cell engraftment and survival. In addition, many types of
cells behave differently when cultured in two-dimensional (2D)
versus 3D substrates14,15, leading to the development of 3D
biomaterials that better mimic aspects of the in vivo cellular
microenvironment16. In particular, microscale fibrous substrates
enhance several neural cell behaviours in vitro, including neurite
outgrowth17, neuronal maturation18 and neuronal differentiation.
These results motivate the interfacing of microscale fibrous
scaffolds with human induced neuronal cells for in vitro and
in vivo applications. The concept of using 3D biomaterials to
support transplantation has been used with synthetic hydrogels19,
microparticles20 and natural protein matrices21,22 to transplant
neural progenitor cells into the brain, however, these sorts
of scaffolds are not conducive to extended culture or maturation
of
cells
in
vitro,
and
yield
limited
control
of
the
cell
microenvironment once transplanted.
In this study, we advance the concept of designing electrospun
synthetic polymer fibres to support the neuronal reprogramming
of iPS cells within a 3D environment via the ectopic expression
of NeuroD1. We demonstrated that fine-tuning the fibrous
architecture enhances neuronal maturation and functionality
in vitro, and also reduces the population of residual unconverted
cells. Finally, we investigated the role of micron-scale fibrous
scaffolds as injectable transplantation vehicles for adherent
networks of iNs, and their ability to enhance the survival
and engraftment of these neurons in murine brain tissue ex vivo
and in vivo.
Results
Induction of neurons via single defined transcription factors.
We initially identified that of the four transcription factors (TFs),
that is, Brn2, Ascl1, Myt1L and NeuroD1, used by Pang et al.12 to
reprogram human fibroblasts to neurons, only Ascl1 and
NeuroD1 could individually induce neuronal conversion of iPS
cells, as also reported elsewhere10. Early neurons induced by
NeuroD1 expression exhibited complex neuronal morphologies
and express mature neuronal markers, so all subsequent studies
were done using NeuroD1 as the single TF for generating iN cells.
We transduced human iPS cells with lentiviruses encoding
tetracycline-inducible, tetOn-NeuroD1, rtTA, and, in selected
cases, tetOn-EGFP, and maintained them as undifferentiated iPS
cells in mTeSR medium for multiple passages in the absence of
doxycycline (dox; Supplementary Fig. 1a). We refer to these cells
as ‘RN-iPS’ cells, since these cells were transduced with rtTA and
NeuroD1. RN-iPS cells maintain expression of pluripotency
markers SSEA-4 and Oct-4 over multiple passages in the absence
of dox, indicating that they remain undifferentiated after
transduction (Supplementary Fig. 1a).
To assess neuronal induction from RN-iPS cells, dense cultures
of RN-iPS cells were seeded and dox was added 24 h after plating
(Supplementary Fig. 1b). Early stage iN cells expressed neuronal
marker bIII-tubulin and residual undifferentiated iPS cells
expressed Oct-4 (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Dox addition rapidly
induces
the loss of
undifferentiated
morphology and
the
acquisition of bipolar, early neuronal morphologies in a subset
of cells within 48 h (Supplementary Fig. 1c–e). Dox also
rapidly induces EGFP expression in control cells transduced with
tetOn-EGFP. By contrast, cells transduced with only tetOn-EGFP
and
rtTA
(lacking
tetOn-NeuroD1)
show
strong
GFP
fluorescence but maintain undifferentiated hPSC morphology
upon dox addition (Supplementary Fig. 1e).
Despite the rapid, dox-induced neuronal conversion of a subset
of RN-iPS cells, the remaining undifferentiated cells proliferated
and
rapidly
overtook
iN
cultures.
To
address
this,
cells
were replated 4 days post dox treatment, which established
more uniform human neuronal cultures and eliminated many
undifferentiated cells (Fig. 1a). The replating process may disrupt
the cell–cell contacts necessary for undifferentiated iPS cell
survival. After replating, enriched iN cells could be maintained
for 4 weeks or longer before characterization.
As expected, human iN cells robustly express bIII-tubulin and
microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) by day 12–14 after dox
addition (Fig. 1b). To identify the neuronal subtypes generated by
this procedure, iN cells were replated 4 days after dox addition
onto
glial
cell
monolayers
as
reported
elsewhere23.
Immunocytochemistry on 28 day iNs post replating revealed that
most cells expressed glutamate vesicular transporter VGLUT1,
indicating
that
these
cells
are
predominantly
excitatory
glutamatergic neurons (Fig. 1c). Occasional cells expressing
markers
of
other
neuronal
subtypes
were
also
observed,
including inhibitory GABAergic neurons (expressing vesicular
GABA
transporter)
and
dopaminergic
neurons
(expressing
tyrosine hydroxylase; Fig. 1c). Most cells also robustly expressed
the pre-synaptic protein synaptophysin (Fig. 1d). Finally, patch-
clamp electrophysiology demonstrated that iN cells are electrically
active and express functional voltage-dependent Naþ channels as
well as voltage-dependent K þ channels as revealed by whole-cell
current recordings (Fig. 1e). Strikingly, these human iN cells were
capable of firing repetitive action potentials (Fig. 1f). Taken
together, these data indicate the robust generation of functional
neuronal cells via NeuroD1 overexpression.
Generation of functional neurons on 3D electrospun fibres.
Next, we investigated whether NeuroD1 expression would simi-
larly induce neuronal conversion and maturation within model
3D electrospun substrates. We constructed fibrous substrates by
electrospinning poly(desaminotyrosyl tyrosine ethyl ester carbo-
nate) (pDTEc), into two architectures, which will be referred to as
‘thin’ and ‘thick’ fibre substrates with average fibre diameters of
1.25±0.05 mm and 3.23±0.06 mm, respectively24 (Fig. 2a–d).
pDTEc is the lead candidate polymer from a combinatorial
library of tyrosine-derived polycarbonates25, as it effectively

 supports pluripotent stem cell culture when fabricated into
microscale fibrous substrates24, and is biocompatible26. Similarly,
our results with 3D polymeric substrates compared with 2D
polymeric substrates suggest that the fibrous architecture governs
the longer term cellular behaviours observed in contrast to the
polymer composition that plays a role on early interfacial
phenomena.
The
thick
fibre
scaffolds
are
volumetrically
permeable
to
cellular
infiltration,
whereas
the
thin
fibre
scaffolds are relatively impermeable, due to decreased void
space between fibres. Without additional material modifications,
it is difficult to produce equal fibre sizes with variable porosity, as
both properties are simultaneously modulated when altering
electrospinning parameters. We hypothesize that cell permeable,
thick fibre substrates will support improved iN maturation and
functionality by promoting enhanced 3D organization and cell–
cell contacts relative to less permeable, thin fibre substrates and
2D controls.
Human iN cells were generated within 3D constructs by
treating RN-iPS cells, cultured on 2D tissue-culture plates, with
dox for 4 days, followed by replating onto 3D electrospun
substrates or 2D controls, according to the time course schematic
shown in Fig. 2e. Human iN cells on 3D electrospun fibres
showed complex morphology with extensive neurite outgrowth
and expressed bIII-tubulin, MAP2 and synaptophysin after 12
days of reprogramming, similarly to 2D cultures (Fig. 2f,g). In
addition, electrophysiological recordings revealed iN cells in
electrospun substrates fired action potentials, demonstrating the
derivation of functional iN cells (Fig. 2h,i).
Effect of 3D scaffold architecture on human iN conversion.
Next, we examined whether the fibre architecture could be tuned
to enhance human iN maturation, as we and others have shown
that geometric cues can influence both human iPS cell and neural
cell behaviours24,27. RN-iPS cells were treated with dox for 4 days,
then replated onto 3D fibrous substrates or 2D controls, including
2D polymer-coated controls, for an additional 8 days of culture.
Immunocytochemistry for proliferation marker Ki67 and Oct-4
revealed that significantly more proliferative and pluripotent cells
were retained when iN cells were replated onto 2D substrates
compared
with
3D
fibrous
substrates
(Po0.05,
one-way
ANOVA; Fig. 3a,c, Supplementary Figs 2,3). This suggests that
the fibrous architectures may be able to selectively reduce the
presence of residual proliferative and pluripotent iPS cells.
Human
iN
cells
in
all
conditions
expressed
extensive
bIII-tubulin-positive
processes,
along
with

expression (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 2). Significantly greater
numbers of human iN cells expressed MAP2 in thick fibre
substrates relative to 2D controls (Po0.0001, one-way ANOVA)
and thin fibre substrates (Po0.05, one-way ANOVA), indicating
accelerated
maturation
(Fig.
3b).
qRT–PCR
also
revealed
increasing trends in expression of several neuronal genes in 3D
substrates relative to 2D controls, including bIII-tubulin, MAP2,
synapsin 1 and VGLUT1, though not statistically significant
(Supplementary Fig. 4). Most importantly, calcium imaging to
identify the fraction of cells that respond to a field electrical
stimulation indicated that thick fibre substrates yielded a high
degree of activity, namely, 470% electrically active cells by day
12 of culture (Fig. 3d–e), which was significantly greater than
those on the thin fibre substrates (Po0.05, one-way ANOVA).
Inhibition of E-cadherin-dependent cell–cell contacts markedly
reduced neuronal outgrowth in 2D, and decreased activity
measured by calcium imaging for iNs on 2D and 3D thick fibre
substrates but not thin fibre substrates (Supplementary Fig. 5).

 This indicates that 3D microfibrous architectures establish
neuronal networks with enhanced cell–cell contacts and influence
both functional and phenotypic maturity of iN cellular networks.
Microscale scaffolds support outgrowth and survival in brain.
Next, transplantable constructs were designed to deliver human
iN cells into the brain for regenerative therapies. The large mats
of electrospun fibres (0.3–2 cm diameter discs) conventionally
fabricated for in vitro studies cannot be easily transplanted into
the CNS. To allow for injection in vivo, 100 mm square ‘microscale
scaffolds’ that could be injected through a 21-gauge needle were
created by downscaling thick fibre electrospun substrates with a
Vibratome. Human iN cells were seeded in suspension onto
microscale scaffolds analogous to our previous studies, which
resulted in efficient population of microscale scaffolds with iN
cells. Cells in microscale scaffolds matured into bIII-tubulin and
MAP2-expressing neuronal cells, similarly to cells on macroscale
fibrous substrates (Supplementary Fig. 6). The average number of
live human iN cells in each scaffold was 83±13 (n ¼ 19;
Supplementary Fig. 7).
The ability of microscale electrospun scaffolds to promote
human iN cell survival and engraftment was first assessed using
an ex vivo model consisting of organotypic hippocampal slice
cultures from NOD-SCID IL2Rgc null mice (Fig. 4a). Human iN
cells on 4–5 microscale scaffolds were injected into hippocampal
slices, alongside equivalent numbers of dissociated cells on
paired slices, and engraftment and functionality was assessed.
Immunocytochemistry revealed that 3 days after transplantation,
injected scaffold-supported iN cells had average neurite lengths of
831±169 mm,
which
was
significantly
greater
(Po0.0001,
one-way ANOVA) than those of injected dissociated iNs, which
had neurite lengths of 241±42 mm (Fig. 4b–e). Electrophysiolo-
gical recordings from human iN cells after 3 weeks indicated that
both dissociated and scaffold-supported iN cells fire action
potentials in response to current injection (Fig. 4f,g), with
scaffold-seeded iN cells displaying enhanced excitability in
response to injected currents (Fig. 4h). In addition, both modes
of transplanted cells had mature Na þ
channel expression
(Fig. 4i). This suggests that microscale scaffolds enhance
engraftment and functionality of transplanted iN cells.
Next, human iN cell survival was assessed after transplantation
of scaffold-supported or dissociated cells into the mouse striatum
in vivo. Three weeks after transplantation (Fig. 5a), immuno-
cytochemistry of a 1.8 mm � 1.8 mm field including the injection
site (Fig. 5b–e) revealed an average survival rate of 5.74±3.16%
based on injected scaffold-seeded iN cells, a 38-fold improvement
(Po0.05, one-way ANOVA) compared with an average survival
rate of 0.15±0.15% of 100,000 injected dissociated iN cells
(Fig. 5g). The survival rate of dissociated iN cell controls was
comparable to that reported by Zhang et al.10 When magnitude
of injected cells were matched at B1,000 cells, quantification of
surviving cells yielded an average of 7.58±4.60% of injected
scaffold-seeded iN cells compared with 0±0% out of 1,000
injected dissociated iN cells. The scaffold-seeded iNs maintained
neurite length (35±8 mm) comparable to those of viable,
dissociated iNs (39±15 mm) in the experiment when number of
injected
cells
was
unmatched.

Discussion
Cell therapies for treatment of CNS brain injury and disease are
challenged by poor cell survival, engraftment and retention after
transplantation both into the brain and spinal cord, with cell
survival ofo1% routinely reported28. The objective of this study
was to advance a new integrated biomaterials-based paradigm to
both rapidly reprogram pluripotent stem cells to neurons and
efficiently deliver enriched, organized neuronal networks to the
brain. To achieve this, we engineered human iPS cells with the
neuronal TF, NeuroD1, and demonstrated efficient and rapid
neuronal conversion in 3D fibrous substrates fabricated from
synthetic polymers that were geometrically tuned to accelerate
neuronal maturation and network establishment. Utilizing this
system, we report that 3D microfibrous substrates can guide
many important characteristics of human iN cells derived from
iPS cells that are relevant for in vivo applications, including
(i) in vitro maturation, electrical activity and purification;
(ii) neurite outgrowth, survival and electrical activity after
transplantation into ex vivo brain tissue and (iii) survival and
engraftment after transplantation in vivo into the striatum. These
results highlight the promise of biomaterials-based delivery as a
platform for reprogramming and regenerative cell sourcing in the
CNS and as a potential model that can be further adapted and
evaluated for therapeutic efficacy.
Our primary hypothesis was that microfibrous substrates with
thick fibres and interfibre spacing would provide a 3D microniche
for rapid, high-purity conversion and accelerated maturation of
iPS cell-derived iNs, and that such 3D substrate-supported
neuronal networks would exhibit improved levels of retention
and engraftment following transplantation into the brain. In vitro,
thick fibre substrates enhanced human iNs maturation and
excitability, while selectively excluding residual undifferentiated
iPS cells. Both of these phenomena arise from controlled cell
confinement and 3D juxtacrine signalling organization. While the
enhanced MAP2 expression in iN cells in thick fibre substrates is
consistent with previously reported results18,29–31, the concurrent
increase in excitability indicates active both phenotypic and
functional maturation. We propose that the thick fibre substrates
drive iN confinement24, leading to accelerated maturation due to
increased
engagement
of
neural
cell-adhesion
molecules
such as L1 or N-cadherin, which have known roles in neural
development32–34 and neuritogenesis29,31. In contrast, the thin
fibre
substrates
fail
to
support
neuronal
infiltration
and
aggregation, resulting in the diminished excitability relative to
more 3D, thick fibre substrates.
For effective scaffolds that can form reprogrammed neuronal
networks, a key feature is that the proliferation of undifferentiated
iPS cells should be suppressed. The geometry we have identified
for electrospun scaffolds limits the proportion of undifferentiated
iPS cells. Undifferentiated human ES and iPS cells require
media supplementation with the rho-associated kinase (ROCK)
inhibitor Y-27632 to survive dissociation to single cells35. In the
absence of Y-27632, the degree to which dissociated iPS cells can
re-establish E-cadherin-mediated cell–cell contacts that have been
demonstrated to be required for survival and proliferation36
is severely diminished when seeded onto electrospun fibrous
substrates. Isolated pluripotent stem cells have been observed to
form
viable
colonies
largely
based
on
motility-induced
aggregation rather than single cell clonal expansion when
intercellular distances were less than 6.4 mm (ref. 37). The large
surface
area,
added
substrate
dimension
and
constrained
migration paths of the electrospun fibres effectively increase
intercellular
distances,
which
would
limit
motility-induced
aggregation
and
could
explain
the
observed
increase
in
differentiation of iPS cells and loss of residual proliferative cells
on
microfibrous
substrates.
This
reduction
in
residual
undifferentiated iPS cells could be used to supplement other
methods for eliminating the risk of teratoma formation in vivo
due to the presence of undifferentiated cells, however, additional
studies are required to assess the tumorigenic potential of these
cells once delivered in vivo.
After establishing a substrate geometry that accelerated iN
maturation, the ability of these substrates to promote engraftment
of human iN cells into the CNS was first probed in an ex vivo
organotypic brain slice model. Delivery of iN cells on microscale

markedly
improved
both
neurite
outgrowth
and
electrical functionality after transplantation compared with the
effects of injected isolated cell suspensions. This suggests that
cell retention and survival are enhanced because transplantation
of iN cells on microscale scaffolds preserves cell–cell contacts
while avoiding the need for dissociation. Dissociation of cells
before injection likely leads to increased anoikis38,39, contributing
to
diminished
engraftment
after
transplantation.
The
improvement in electrical activity after transplantation of iN
cells in scaffolds is promising, and suggests that these benefits
may translate in vivo.
Transplantation of iN cells in scaffolds into the mouse striatum
showed that the percentage of viable cells after 3 weeks was an
order-of-magnitude greater than that relative to injection of
isolated single cells. This increased survival is likely indicative of
decreased anoikis or apoptosis that otherwise arises from
enzymatic disruption of cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions38,39.
These results are promising particularly in light of recent studies
investigating the effects of human iPS cell-derived neurons on
treating CNS disorders that have shown efficacy in vivo even
with low levels of cell survival1,10, suggesting that increased
cell survival could lead to amplified levels of efficacy of these cell
therapeutics. In addition, host neuron post-synaptic markers were
detected adjacent to pre-synaptic marker-expressing transplanted
neurons, suggesting that single-factor reprogrammed neurons are
capable of functionally integrating into host tissue. Interestingly,
some authors have found that extensive lesions can actually
enhance neuronal graft survival and integration, as denervated
targets may provide a positive stimulatory effect to new
neurons40,41, suggesting that even greater cell survival may be
possible
when
applying
this
scaffold
system
in
a
neurodegenerative disease or injury context.
Finally, the ability for 3D microscale scaffolds to support
co-culture and concurrent transplantation of neuronal networks
consisting of neurons of multiple subtypes was evaluated.
Transplantation of intact networks of mixed subtype neuron
populations could be an invaluable tool for treating complex
brain disorders or injuries that affect multiple subtypes, or for
priming transplanted neurons with pre-established synaptic
inputs. For example, attempts for transplanting dopamine
neurons derived from fetal brain tissue42,43 or derived from
human iPS cells1,44 have been made and yield amelioration of
Parkinson’s Disease; with the paradigm we proposed one can
envision a model to graft mini-neurocircuitry composed of
excitatory-dopaminergic
neurons
into
the
host
brain.
We
hypothesize that proper excitation from the mini-neurocircuitry
could produce more profound amelioration of locomotive deficits
in Parkinson’s Disease.
Induced human neurons offer a rich cell source for a variety of
in vitro and in vivo applications in modelling and treating CNS
diseases and injuries. Our prototype epitomizes a biomaterial

 transplantation strategy that encourages transplant survival and
engraftment. Similar prototypes could be engineered to apply
human neuronal cells of varying subtypes for targeted treatment
of a wide range of CNS disorders.
Methods
Lentivirus production. The lentiviral constructs rtTA-FUW, Tet-O-FUW
NeuroD1, Tet-O-FUW EGFP, Tet-O-FUW Ascl1, Tet-O-FUW Nurr1, Tet-O-FUW
Lmx1a, Tet-O-FUW Pitx3, Tet-O-FUW EN1, Tet-O-FUW Foxa2, and the
packaging plasmids pMDL.g/pRRE, pMD.2 (VSVg), and RSV-REV were
constructed by the Marius Wernig laboratory at Stanford University. Lentivirus
particles were generated by first transfecting 293FT cells by the calcium phosphate
precipitation method with each of the three packaging plasmids and one of the
lentiviral plasmids in standard 293FT medium, which consists of DMEM
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% non-essential amino acids (all from
Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Lonza,
Walkersville, PA)45. Medium is replaced after 24 h and medium containing
viral particles is collected at 48 and 72 h. Viral particles are concentrated
200 � by ultracentrifugation at 25,000 r.p.m. for 2 h at 4 �C, and stored at � 80 �C
until use.
iPS cell culture and neuronal conversion. Human iPS cells were obtained from
the Rutgers University RUCDR Infinite Biologics. iPS cells were derived from
human foreskin fibroblasts by retroviral infection with Oct-4, Sox2, Klf4 and
c-Myc46. Human iPS cells were cultured on Matrigel-treated dishes in mTeSR-1
(ref. 24). iPS cells were passaged with dispase every 5–7 days with manual removal
of spontaneously differentiated areas with fire-polished glass pipets. iPS cells from
passage 15–35 were used in these studies. iPS cells were passaged as single cells with
Accutase (Stem Cell Technologies) plated at high density (8 � 104 cells per cm2) in
mTeSR-1 supplemented with 5 mM Y-27632 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN)35.
The following day, medium was replaced with mTeSR-1 with 5 mM Y-27632 and
2 mM polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) and concentrated virus was added
(rtTA-FUW, Tet-O-FUW NeuroD1, and in some experiments, Tet-O-FUW
EGFP). The following day, medium was replaced with mTeSR-1 and cells were
returned to normal culture for up to eight additional passages. To induce neuronal
conversion, infected iPSCs (termed iPSC-RNs) were passaged with Accutase and
Y-27632, and the following day switched to an N2-based conversion medium
(N2M) consisting of DMEM/F12, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 � N2 supplement,
1 � non-essential amino acids, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 2 mg ml � 1
doxycycline, which induces expression of the NeuroD1 and EGFP constructs.
Medium was replaced daily, and cells were replated on day 3–5 onto 2D or 3D
substrates. One day after replating, medium was switched to NBM, consisting of
neurobasal medium, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 � B27 supplement without Vitamin A
(Life Technologies), 0.2 mM ascorbic acid, 1 mM cAMP (Sigma-Aldrich),
2 mg ml � 1 doxycycline and 10 ng ml � 1 each of brain-derived neurotrophic factor,
Glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3 (Peprotech).
Medium was replaced every 2–3 days for the duration of the experiments.
To generate dopamine iNs for co-culture studies, 2.5 � 105 cells per six-well
plate were plated, and the following day medium was replaced with mTeSR-1 with
5 mM Y-27632, 2 mM polybrene, and concentrated virus was added (rtTA-FUW,
Ascl1, Nurr1, Lmx1a and, in some experiments, Tet-O-FUW RFP). After three
days, medium was replaced with Neurobasal media (Life Technologies) and
concentrated virus (Pitx3, EN1, Foxa2). Four days after initial infection, the
dopamine iNs would be co-seeded onto microscale scaffolds.
Electrospun fibrous substrate fabrication. Fibrous substrates and 2D polymer
film controls were fabricated from tyrosine-derived polycarbonate pDTEc via
electrospinning and spin-coating, respectively24. These polymers come from a
combinatorial library of polymers with tunable hydrophobicity and degradation
properties. pDTEc was dissolved in 1,1,1,3,3,3-Hexafluoro-2-propanol
(Sigma-Aldrich) at 9%, or 18% weight by volume for thin and thick fibre
configurations respectively. For the 9% weight by volume solution, 5% N,N-
dimethylformamide was added to prevent beading of fibres. Polymer solutions
were electrospun from a þ 18 kV spinneret to a � 6 kV flat plate collector at
3 ml h � 1 over a distance of 30 cm, resulting in fibre mats 250–500-mm thick.
Surface morphology was observed on an AMRAY 1830 I scanning electron
microscope and fibre diameter was quantified by measuring 100 individual fibres
from each fibrous substrate using NIH-ImageJ software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).
Quantitative data are presented as mean±95% confidence interval. Control
2D polymer films were prepared using a 1% polymer solution dissolved in
tetrahydrofuran, which was then spin-coated onto glass coverslips at 4,000 r.p.m.
for 30 s (ref. 47). For in vitro studies, electrospun fibres were sterilized by ultraviolet
treatment, oxygen plasma treated for hydration, and adsorbed with 10 mg ml � 1
poly-D-lysine in HEPES buffer (pH 8.4) and 4 mg ml � 1 laminin in PBS before
seeding dissociated iNs 4 days after initiating neuronal conversion with
N2M þ dox.
Microscale scaffold preparation and neuronal seeding. Microscale fibrous
scaffolds were prepared by cutting oxygen plasma treated and hydrated electrospun
fibre mats into 100 mm squares with a McIlwain tissue chopper (Vibratome),
and sterilized and coated with poly-D-lysine and laminin as described above. On
day 4 of neuronal conversion, iN cells were dissociated with Accutase and
resuspended in N2M with dox at 5 million cells per ml. The scaffolds and iN
cell suspension were mixed in a 48-well non-TCPS plate for 1 h with occasional
gentle agitation, followed by three washes to remove unattached cells. Scaffolds
containing iN cells were cultured for 1 day in N2M, then cultured in NBM until
used for ex vivo or in vivo experiments. For experiments examining co-cultures of
dopamine iNs and NeuroD1 iNs, dissociated dopamine and NeuroD1 iNs were
dissociated, resuspended and combined 1:1 ratios to a concentration of 5 million
total cells per ml.
Ex vivo slice preparation and scaffold transplantation. Organotypic mouse brain
slice cultures were prepared by isolating the cortico-striatal area of 6-day-old C57BL/
6 mouse brains and cutting into 300 mm slices using a vibratome (Leica Micro-
systems) in ice-cold sucrose solution (204mM sucrose, 26.2 mM NaHCO3, 11mM
glucose, 2.5mM KCl, 2 mM MgSO4, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 0.5mM CaCl2 saturated with
95% O2 and 5% CO2) (ref. 48). Slices were transferred onto Millicell organotypic cell
culture inserts (Millipore) in a six-well tissue-culture plate and cultured in
Neurobasal A medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 1 mg ml� 1 insulin,
0.5mM ascorbic acid, 25% horse serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Mouse
brain slices were cultured for 2 days before iN cell transplantation. Two days after
preparing brain slices, dissociated and scaffold-seeded GFP þ iN cells (day 6
post-conversion) were transplanted onto the surface of the cortico-striatal slices
using a pipette. Medium was changed every 2–3 days and slices were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde after 7 days for immunohistochemistry to quantify neurite out-
growth, or cultured 14 days before electrophysiology studies.
In vivo cell injection and scaffold transplantation. All animal experiments were
carried out according to the Rutgers University Policy on Animal Welfare and were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Rut-
gers University Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. Male, 5-week-old NOD-
SCID IL2Rgc null mice (20–35 g; Jackson Laboratory) were anaesthetised with
isoflurane (induction at 4% and maintained at 0.5–1% inhalation) and injected
with a total volume of 10 ml, containing either 1 � 103, 1 � 105 dissociated GFP þ
iN cells or B10 scaffolds seeded with GFP þ iN cells (B85 cells per scaffold) at day
6 after initiating neuronal conversion, resuspended in ice-cold MEM (Life Tech-
nologies). Cells or cells on scaffolds were injected stereotactically into the striatum
using a 100 ml gastight Hamilton syringe and 21G Hamilton needle. Bilateral
injections were made at the following coordinates (in mm): AP, 0.5 (from bregma);
ML, � 2.0; DV, � 3.0 (from dura). Mice were killed and processed for immuno-
histochemistry 3 weeks after transplantation for quantification of human iN cells
within the graft by visualization of the human-specific nuclei antibody HuNu
(Millipore) GFP, and RFP in the case of multiple-subtype co-transplantation (see
Supplementary Table 1 for a detailed list of primary antibodies). Neurite outgrowth
was quantified by measurement of GFP þ neurites.
Electrophysiology. Electrophysiolocial recordings were performed at prescribed
time intervals from iN cells in 2D or 3D configurations in whole-cell mode using a
Multiclamp 700B amplifier12,45. The bath solution contained 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM
KCl, 2 mM MgCl1, 2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM HEPES and 10 mM glucose, at pH 7.4. The
pipette solution for whole-cell voltage-dependent current recordings and for
current-clamp experiments contained 10 mM KCl, 123 mM K-gluconate, 1 mM
MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 4 mM glucose, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM K2ATP,
0.2 mM Na4GTP, pH 7.2. Membrane resting potentials were kept in the range of
� 65 to � 70 mV, with step currents injected to elicit action potentials.
Immunocytochemistry. Neuronal phenotypes were characterized by
immunocytochemistry for 2D and 3D substrates. Cells were fixed with 4% paraf-
ormaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, followed by three washes with PBS.
Cells were simultaneously blocked and permeabilized in blocking buffer consisting
of PBS supplemented with 5% normal goat serum (MP Biomedicals), 1% bovine
serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at
room temperature. Primary antibodies were incubated in blocking buffer at 4 �C
overnight, followed by three 15-min PBS washes. Fluorophore-conjugated sec-
ondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488, 594, or 647, Life Technologies) were incubated
in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, followed by three 15-min washes
and at least one wash of 1–2 h. Samples were counter-stained with 40,6-Diamidino-
2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) to visualize nuclei and mounted
with Prolong Gold Anti-Fade reagent (Life Technologies) before imaging. Samples
were imaged on a Leica SP2 laser scanning confocal microscope using 10 � dry or
63 � immersion objectives. Images of cells on 3D electrospun fibres are presented
as maximum intensity projections of z-stacks, unless otherwise stated. Image
quantification was performed via custom ImageJ macros and manual counting. A
complete listing of the primary antibodies used in this study can be found in
Supplementary Table 1.

 Calcium imaging. iN cells were labelled with 3 mM Fluo-4 AM calcium indicator
dye for 30 min at room temperature in extracellular bath solution (147 mM NaCl,
5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES and 10 uM Glucose, pH 7.4
and osmolarity 290–300 mOsm) containing 0.02% pluronic F-127. After incuba-
tion, cells were rinsed twice with bath solution and incubated for an additional
30 min at room temperature to allow complete de-esterification of the Fluo-4
AM dye before imaging. Time-lapse imaging was performed on a Leica SP2 con-
focal microscope at a resolution of 512 � 512 pixels and a time resolution of
1 Hz. Image analysis was performed using custom ImageJ macros and MATLAB
routines for semi-automated ROI selection and peak detection to quantify
the fraction of cells that were electrically active. Cells were considered to be elec-
trically active if they showed a spike in fluorescence following application of an
electrical stimulus. The electrical stimulus was applied using a function generator
(Global Specialties) and consisted of a 5 s stimulus at 7.5 V cm � 1 with 5 ms square
pulses at 40 Hz.
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Total RNA was extracted
from iPS cells cultured in 2D or 3D using the RNEasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, including treatment with RNase-free
DNase to remove genomic DNA. A high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) containing random primers was used to
reverse transcribe 200 ng total RNA from each sample to cDNA. Taqman gene 194
expression master mix and Taqman gene-expression assays (Applied Biosystems)
were used for template amplification of 10 ng cDNA per reaction. Quantitative
real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT–PCR) was carried out on a 7500 Fast
Real-Time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems). Relative gene expression was
calculated using the DDCT method, normalizing to GAPDH as the endogenous
control and undifferentiated IPS cells in standard 2D culture (on Matrigel-coated
dishes in mTeSR media) after 7 days as the reference sample. Taqman
gene-expression assays were used in these studies, listed in Supplementary
Table 2.
Statistical analysis. All data are presented as mean±s.d. Statistical significance is
evaluated by single-factor ANOVA and a Tukey’s post hoc test, with Po0.05
considered statistically significant.
