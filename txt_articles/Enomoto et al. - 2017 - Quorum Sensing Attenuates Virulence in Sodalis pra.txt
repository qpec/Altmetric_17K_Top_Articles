In Brief
Enomoto et al. show that a progenitor of
the widely distributed Sodalis-allied
insect endosymbionts utilizes quorum
sensing to suppress virulence factors
following the establishment of infection.
This allows bacteria to maintain a benign
and persistent infection in their insect
host, possibly facilitating the evolution of
mutualistic relationships.

SUMMARY
Sodalis praecaptivus is a close relative and putative
environmental progenitor of the widely distributed,
insect-associated, Sodalis-allied symbionts. Here
we show that mutant strains of S. praecaptivus that
lack genetic components of a quorum-sensing (QS)
apparatus have a rapid and potent killing phenotype
following microinjection into an insect host. Tran-
scriptomic and genetic analyses indicate that insect
killing occurs as a consequence of virulence fac-
tors, including insecticidal toxins and enzymes that
degrade the insect integument, which are normally
repressed by QS at high infection densities. This
method of regulation suggests that virulence factors
are only utilized in early infection to initiate the insect-
bacterial association. Once bacteria reach sufficient
density in host tissues, the QS circuit represses
expression of these harmful genes, facilitating a
long-lasting and benign association. We discuss
the implications of the functionality of this QS system
in the context of establishment and evolution of
mutualistic relationships involving these bacteria.
INTRODUCTION
Many eukaryotes harbor mutualistic bacteria that increase host
fitness and facilitate environmental niche diversification (Doug-
las, 2014). Insects serve as useful systems for the study of
symbiosis because they are readily amenable to genomic and
experimental study. While much is known about the evolution
and functions of symbiosis in insects (Moran et al., 2008), little
is known about how these mutualistic associations originate.
One conspicuous finding is that certain bacterial phylotypes
are predisposed to the development of these mutualisms. Exam-
ples include representatives of the Sodalis genera, which are
found in a wide range of distantly related insect hosts (Snyder
et al., 2011; Clayton et al., 2012).
Although certain symbionts provide specialized functions for
their insect hosts (e.g., defense: Oliver et al., 2010), many just
provide simple nutritional supplements, such as amino acids
and vitamins (Douglas, 2009). Since these metabolites can be
made by a wide range of bacteria, the notion of specialized func-
tion cannot explain the propensity of certain phylotypes to
develop these associations. Rather, selected lineages seem pre-
disposed to developing these associations as a result of genetic
adaptations (Sachs et al., 2013). One of the most significant chal-
lenges in host association involves circumventing the sophisti-
cated physical and molecular defenses that prevent bacterial
entry and colonization. To this end, pathogens have evolved
numerous molecular adaptations (virulence properties) to com-
bat these processes and enhance bacterial infection. These
range from relatively innocuous physical adaptations that facili-
tate resistance to factors of immunity to the secretion of en-
zymes and toxins that degrade host integument and inflict
damage on tissues and cells (Vallet-Gely et al., 2008). It stands
to reason that mutualists would experience stronger selection
to limit the application of virulence in order to maximize host
fitness and the likelihood of success of the resulting association.
In this study, we explore interactions between a close free-
living relative of the Sodalis-allied insect endosymbionts, Sodalis
praecaptivus (Clayton et al., 2012), and a grain weevil host, Sito-
philus zeamais, that harbors a very recently derived Sodalis-
allied endosymbiont (Lefe
` vre et al., 2004). Close relatives of
S. praecaptivus have been identified in a wide range of insect
hosts (Snyder et al., 2011; Clayton et al., 2012), and genomic an-
alyses indicate that these mutualistic symbionts have evolved
repeatedly and independently from an S. praecaptivus-like ante-
cedent, undergoing substantial genome degeneration and size
reduction as a consequence of the loss of many genes that
lack adaptive value following the transition to the static symbiotic
lifestyle (Clayton et al., 2012; Husnik and McCutcheon, 2016).
Regarding their origin, the closest relatives of S. praecaptivus
have been found in certain stinkbugs and chestnut weevils, in
which these bacteria have a sporadic frequency of infection
among insect populations (Kaiwa et al., 2010; Toju and Fukatsu,
2011), suggesting that they are not maternally transmitted by
these insects but are instead acquired horizontally from the envi-
ronment by each new insect generation. Since such a transient
association is not compatible with the notion of obligate mutu-
alism, we proposed that these insects may serve as vectors for
the transmission of these bacteria to alternative hosts; namely
the trees that the stinkbugs are known to feed upon (Clayton
et al., 2012). In support of this, S. praecaptivus shares many ge-
netic features (including genes encoding plant virulence factors)
with the closely related phytopathogenic lineage comprising
Erwinia and relatives, which are also often vectored by insects
(Nadarasah and Stavrinides, 2011).
The regulation of gene expression is an important adaptive
trait that facilitates the modification of physiology in accordance
with the environment. One such mode of regulation is quorum

 sensing (QS), in which bacteria synthesize an autoinducer pher-
omone that increases in accordance with bacterial density and
interacts at a threshold concentration with response regulators
to facilitate changes in gene expression (Fuqua et al., 2001; Wa-
ters and Bassler, 2005). In the current study, we investigated the
role of a QS system in S. praecaptivus and found that it nega-
tively regulates a potent insect-killing phenotype. We propose
that the negative regulation of virulence by QS is an important
adaptation that contributes to the ability of Sodalis-allied symbi-
onts to develop and sustain associations with insects.
RESULTS
S. praecaptivus and S. glossinidius Maintain
Homologous Quorum-Sensing Systems
The tsetse fly symbiont S. glossinidius was previously shown to
produce N-(3-oxohexanoyl) homoserine lactone (OHHL) as a QS
signaling molecule via the protein product of a gene designated
sogI (Pontes et al., 2008). To characterize the S. praecaptivus
signaling molecule, we separated ethyl acetate extracts of
S. glossinidius and S. praecaptivus culture media by thin-layer
chromatography (TLC) and overlaid them with an Agrobacterium
tumefaciens reporter strain that yields a blue spot in the pres-
ence of an N-acyl homoserine lactone (Zhu et al., 2003). Since
the resulting spots co-localized on the TLC plate, we conclude
that S. praecaptivus also produces OHHL (Figure 1A). In addi-
tion, S. praecaptivus maintains two LuxR-like response regula-
tors (ypeR and yenR; locus tags Sant_3587 and Sant_1175,
respectively) sharing >90% amino acid sequence identity with
orthologs from S. glossinidius.
Transcriptomic Analysis of the S. praecaptivus QS
System
To identify genes regulated by quorum sensing, we used RNA
sequencing (RNA-seq) to compare gene expression levels in a
DypeI mutant strain of S. praecaptivus in vitro in the presence
or absence of 10 mg/mL OHHL, which mimics a high cell density
state. Thirty genes were found to have >4-fold changes in
expression (Figure 2A), and most (26/30) showed a decrease in
expression in response to OHHL. Many of the OHHL-repressed
genes have putative functions associated with insect patho-
genesis. These include homologs of the PirAB insecticidal
toxin (Sant_2443 and Sant_2444), genes encoding chitinases
(Sant_1984 and Sant_1963), chitin-binding domain-containing
proteins (Sant_1090 and Sant_P0292), and collagenase-like pro-
teases (Sant_3444 and Sant_3445).
Only four genes demonstrated a significant increase in expres-
sion in response to OHHL. Curiously, the top two induced genes,
cpmA and cpmJ (Sant_3163 and Sant_3164), were also induced
in S. glossinidius and are homologous to components of the
carbapenem biosynthesis gene cluster that is present in some
enteric bacteria (Pontes et al., 2008). The other two genes
induced by OHHL were a putative carbon starvation protein
(cstA; Sant_2155) and a putative autoinducer 2 kinase (lsrK;
Sant_3797) that may be involved in the regulation of another
quorum-sensing pathway.
To determine the roles of YpeR and YenR in the regulation of
expression via QS, we compared the RNA-seq profiles of DypeR
and DyenR mutant strains with the wild-type (WT) strain in the
presence of OHHL (Figure 2A). Although both regulators clearly
contribute to the differential regulation of the genes identified
in the experiment involving the DypeI mutant strain, the solo
response regulator (YenR) has a more potent effect on differen-
tial regulation, given that the transcriptomic profile of the DyenR
mutant strain more closely mimics that of a DypeI mutant
strain lacking OHHL. However, this seems to be due to the
loss of OHHL synthase (YpeI) expression in the DyenR strain,
which has �50-fold less ypeI transcripts relative to the WT strain
(Table S1; see entries highlighted in green on pages 2 and 3). To
explore this further, we assayed the amount of OHHL produced
by the WT, DypeI, DypeR, and DyenR strains. In liquid culture, the
DypeI strain failed to produce any OHHL (Figures 1B and 1C),
consistent with the notion that ypeI is the only gene encoding
an N-acyl HSL synthase in S. praecaptivus. This was further
corroborated using an alternative reporter (Chromobacterium
violaceum strain CV026; McClean et al., 1997), which also only
detected a molecule produced by the WT strain (Figures 1D
and 1E). In agreement with the transcriptomic data, the amount
of OHHL produced by the DyenR mutant was greatly reduced
relative to WT (�10-fold at 12 hr; Figure 1B), consistent with

 the notion that YenR enhances ypeI transcription and/or YpeR
represses ypeI transcription. This is further supported by the
fact that a DyenR DyenR double-mutant strain also produces a
greatly reduced amount of OHHL and a DypeR mutant strain
shows an elevated level of OHHL production relative to WT
(�10-fold at 12 hr; Figure 1B). However, the transcriptomic
data show that the counts of ypeI transcripts are actually (�2-
fold) lower in the DypeR mutant relative to the WT strain, sug-
gesting that the OHHL level in the culture media is also controlled
by mechanisms other than the modulation of ypeI transcription.
Interestingly, some LuxR homologs regulate transcription in the

absence of their signaling molecules, and
their regulatory functions are antagonized
by N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) (Tsai
and Winans, 2010). Genes encoding these
particular luxI and luxR homologs (including
those in S. praecaptivus) often overlap at
their 30
ends to mediate transcriptional
antagonism. Taken together, these results
indicate that there is a complex regulatory
interplay between YpeI, YpeR, and YenR
that facilitates QS-based signaling.
Validation of Transcriptomic Data
Since two S. praecaptivus genes encoding
chitinases were significantly downregulated
in response to OHHL, we performed chiti-
nase assays in WT, DypeI, DypeR, and
DyenR strains of S. praecaptivus. The high-
est activity was found in the DypeI strain
lacking OHHL (Figure 2B), consistent with
the notion of QS-based repression. In addi-
tion, the DypeR strain had a chitinase activity
similar to the WT strain, indicating that YenR
alone can repress chitinase in the presence of OHHL. Also, the
DyenR mutant strain had significantly higher chitinase activity,
consistent with the repression of OHHL synthesis. Together
with the observation that the DyenR DypeR double mutant has
high chitinase activity, these results corroborate those obtained
from RNA-seq analysis and the OHHL assays.

work,
we
noticed
that
the
S. praecaptivus WT strain had a growth rate that was significantly

631
 reduced relative to the DypeI mutant (Figure 1C). This was
corroborated by a series of experiments performed on solid
media, which show that OHHL inhibits growth of both the
S. praecaptivus WT and the DypeR mutant strains, but not the
DyenR strain (Figure 3A). In addition, a plasmid overexpressing
the OHHL synthase (YpeI) could only be maintained in a DyenR
background, and this strain strongly inhibited the growth of
adjacent WT and DypeR (but not DyenR) strains (Figure 3B).
In order to identify the gene(s) responsible for this growth sup-
pression in vitro, we generated mutant strains of S. praecaptivus
lacking genes identified in the transcriptomic analysis (Table S1)
and screened for relief of growth suppression. This led to the dis-
covery that cmpA (but not the adjacent cpmJ gene) is largely
responsible for the growth suppression phenotype observed
in this study (Figures 3C and 3D). Curiously, while cpmA and
cpmJ share significant sequence identity with components of
an antibiotic (carbepenem) biosynthesis pathway found in other
Gram-negative bacteria (Coulthurst et al., 2005; Derzelle et al.,
2002), the majority of genes in this pathway are absent in Sodalis
spp., and their CpmA homologs lack a critical region of a b-lac-
tam synthase, indicating that they cannot make this antibiotic.
Conservation of an asparagine synthase domain in CpmA sug-
gests that its function involves amidohydrolase activity (Miller
et al., 2003), which has wide-ranging functions in nature.
Notably, the transcriptomic data (Table S1) show that cpmA is
the 12th most abundant protein-coding transcript in the presence
of OHHL, and since cpmA has been retained under the control of
QS in two insect symbionts, (Pontes et al., 2008), we conclude
that it likely has an important function in symbiotic interactions.

 and survival were monitored daily (Figure S1; Table S2). At 1 week
following injection, weevils injected with the DypeI strain became
lethargic (Figure S1) and died over the course of the next 2 weeks
(Figure 4A). Weevils injected with the wild-type strain suffered no
lethargyor death aside from a small percentage of early deaths re-
sulting from injuries sustained as a consequence of microinjec-
tion (<5%).
Injection of the DypeR and DyenR mutant strains yielded a de-
layed/reduced killing effect relative to the DypeI strain, and a
DyenR DypeR double mutant killed as effectively and rapidly
as the DypeI mutant (Figure 4A). Further confirmation of the
role of QS in killing was obtained by injection with a 1:1 mixture
of WT and mutant strains. WT bacteria suppressed the killing ef-
fect of the DypeI mutant by providing a source of exogenous
OHHL (Figure 4B). However, WT bacteria did not mitigate the
killing of the DypeR or DyenR mutant strains because they lack
the means to respond to OHHL. These results show that YpeR
and YenR act synergistically to repress expression of genes
involved in killing, with YpeR (DyenR) having a more potent ef-
fect. This contrasts with the in vitro results and suggests that
the regulatory interactions between YenR, YpeR, and YpeI func-
tion in a different way in vivo likely as a consequence of distinct
physical conditions or the influence of additional regulatory
elements. Nonetheless, the results clearly show that strains of
S. praecaptivus lacking any of the three genic components of
the QS system have a potent weevil-killing phenotype that is
suppressed in WT bacteria.
Identification of the Genic Effectors of Killing
In order to identify the QS-regulated genes that are responsible
for weevil killing, we identified differentially expressed genes that
might play a role in killing based on their predicted functions.
These genes (highlighted in yellow in Table S2) were then
knocked out in a DypeI mutant background, and the resulting
double mutants were injected into weevils to assess their killing
capability. None of the double mutants tested were completely
relieved of their weevil-killing phenotype. However, the DypeI
DregC, DypeI DpirA, and DypeI DpirB double-mutant strains all
demonstrated a statistically significant delay in killing (Figure 4C;
Tables S2 and S3). Comparative analysis of DpirA, DpirB, and
DpirAB mutant strains yielded results that are consistent with
the notion that PirA and PirB constitute a binary toxin complex,
requiring both components for activity. The highest level of sup-
pression was observed with a DypeI DpirAB DregC quadruple
mutant, suggesting that RegC and PirAB function independently
to impact killing. However, even this strain was not completely
suppressed in terms of killing.
We also tested the effect of a DypeI Dsant_1962 double
mutant, because this protein shares high sequence identity
with insecticidal endotoxins and is also differentially regulated
Figure 4. Weevil Survival Following Injection of WT and Mutant S. praecaptivus

most potent killing phenotype.

(C) Identification of genes that mediate weevil killing. Inactivation of pirA, pirB, and regC genes produce a significant delay in weevil killing in a DypeI genetic
background, with PirAB and RegC having a synergistic effect. Data and results of statistical tests related to (A)–(C) are reported in Tables S2 and S3.

Note that the infection densities of the DyenR and DypeR strains increase over time relative to the WT and DcpmAJ strains (D), particularly in the latter stages of
infection, concomitant with insect death (E).
(F) Weevil infection rates observed 7 days after injection of a reduced number of bacterial cells (1:10 dilution of overnight culture). Statistical analysis of the data
(likelihood ratio test) shows that the DpirAB strain has a reduced infection rate relative to the other strains tested (p = 0.0084).

 by OHHL (adjusted p = 0.09; Table S1). However, weevils in-
jected with this strain showed no suppression of killing relative
to the DypeI single mutant (Table S3). All other genes encoding
putative toxins (Sant_0919, Sant_1053, and Sant_2840) dis-
played no significant reduction in expression in the presence of
OHHL in the transcriptomic analyses (Table S1). Thus, we
conclude that there are other effectors of killing or combinatorial
effects that have not been identified in our limited screen.
In order to examine the role of CpmA-mediated growth sup-
pression in killing, we also injected weevils with DcpmAJ mutant
strains. However, deletion of cpmAJ had no effect on killing
either when the mutation was maintained alone or in a DypeI
background (Figure 4C). Bacterial infection densities remained
constant for the WT strain throughout the course of weevil infec-
tion, whereas the DypeR and DyenR strains demonstrated a >10-
fold and �2-fold increase in infection density, respectively,
consistent with their enhanced virulence properties (Figures 4D
and 4E; Table S2). However, the DcpmAJ strain maintained
lower numbers in the insect, especially at the onset of infection,
consistent with the notion that CpmA has an adaptive role in vivo.
Loss of PirAB Impairs the Ability of S. praecaptivus to
Infect Weevils
To determine whether the virulence factors identified in this
study have an adaptive role during the initial stages of
S. praecaptivus infection, we injected reduced numbers of WT
and mutant strains of S. praecaptivus into weevils and screened
for the presence of bacteria at 7 days post-infection. Only the
DpirAB mutant strain was found to have a statistically significant
infection defect (Figure 4F). It should be noted, however, that
virulence is clearly a polygenic trait in S. praecaptivus, and
many of the putative virulence factors identified in our transcrip-
tomic screen have redundant functions (e.g., chitinases). In addi-
tion, microinjection is not a natural route of infection and might
obviate the requirement for bacteria to utilize virulence factors
to degrade the host integument.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we show that S. praecaptivus maintains a QS sys-
tem with complex regulatory dynamics that utilizes the same
signaling molecule (OHHL) and is genetically orthologous to
the system previously characterized in the tsetse fly symbiont
S. glossinidius (Pontes et al., 2008). However, transcriptomic
analyses show that these bacteria differ markedly in the
target genes that are regulated by QS. Indeed, the only
component of QS-mediated regulation that is shared between
S. praecaptivus and S. glossinidius involves upregulation of
cpmA and cpmJ transcripts in response to OHHL. The work out-
lined here shows that CpmA mediates the suppression of
S. praecaptivus growth in vitro in response to the QS signal
OHHL. This OHHL-mediated growth suppression is eliminated
in mutant strains lacking cpmA, ypeI (encoding the OHHL syn-
thase), or yenR (a QS response regulator).
The transcriptomic analyses in this study show that the
S. praecaptivus QS system has some unique properties that
have been lost in S. glossinidius as a consequence of genome
degeneration in the obligate insect-associated lifestyle (Clayton
et al., 2012). Principal among these is the observation that QS re-
duces the expression of virulence factors that are anticipated to
target insects, including insecticidal toxins and enzymes that
degrade the insect integument. We compared the effects of in-
jecting WT and QS mutant strains of S. praecaptivus into a weevil
host. This led to the striking finding that QS-deficient strains have
a potent weevil-killing phenotype. Thus, it appears that the QS
system has evolved to maintain a benign and long-lasting infec-
tion in the weevil. Subsequent experiments revealed that killing
is mediated by virulence factors rather than (CpmA-mediated)
growth suppression.
The binary insecticidal Pir toxins were initially identified as key
virulence factors in the insect pathogen Photorhabdus lumines-
cens (Waterfield et al., 2005). They were subsequently found in
other pathogenic bacteria, including Vibrio parahaemolyticus,
in which they play an important role in shrimp pathogenesis (Sir-
ikharin et al., 2015). It was shown that the crystal structure of the
V. parahaemolyticus Pir toxin complex resembles those of the
Bacillus thuringiensis Cry toxins, suggesting that they may
have a conserved mode of action that ultimately causes destabi-
lization of the host cell cytoskeleton, leading to cell death (Lee
et al., 2015). Another gene identified to impact weevil killing
by S. praecaptivus (regC) shares substantial sequence and
structural homology with a bacteriophage P2 transcriptional
repressor. It may serve as a secondary transcriptional regulator
in the QS circuit, modulating the transcription of additional
gene(s) that enhance the killing phenotype that were not identi-
fied in our limited screen. This is supported by the observation
that the deletion of pirAB and regC has an additive effect in sup-
pressing the killing mediated by the QS-defective DypeI strain.
Since QS reduces the expression of genes (including pirAB and
regC) under conditions of high bacterial population density, it
stands to reason that these genes should provide a beneficial
function when their expression is elevated at low bacterial popu-
lation density. Since infections must commence from low density,
the functions of these virulence genes are expected to be impor-
tant in mediating entry of host tissues and cells. Consistent
with this interpretation, the recently derived insect symbionts
S. glossinidius and Ca. S. pierantonius have already lost many of
the QS-regulated virulence genes, including pirAB. This is antici-
pated to occur as a consequence of the transition to permanent
insect association because endosymbionts do not have to under-
take cyclical infection of hosts. Furthermore, our results show
that a mutant strain of S. praecaptivus lacking PirAB is deficient
in its ability to establish infection in weevils via microinjection.
Notably, the attenuation of virulence (toward the vector) is pre-
dicted to be an important adaptation for a vector-borne pathogen
because virulence decreases host fitness and therefore reduces
the likelihood of successful (vector-borne) pathogen dispersal
(Elliot et al., 2003; Ewald, 1987). It is also one of the two criteria,
along with a switch from horizontal to vertical transmission, pre-
dicted to be of key importance in the evolutionary transition from
parasitism to mutualism (Ewald, 1987). To this end, the QS sys-
tem in S. praecaptivus acts to enhance the ability of this bacte-
rium to maintain a long-standing infection in an insect host. This
mechanism of gene expression control mitigates one side of
the double-edged sword of virulence by limiting the harm inflicted
upon the host once a successful infection has been established.
At one level, this distinguishes S. praecaptivus from a wide variety
of pathogenic bacteria, including the entomopathogen Bacillus

 thuringiensis (Dubois et al.. 2012), that utilize QS to enhance the
expression of virulence factors at high infection densities in order
to facilitate a concerted and debilitating attack on the host
(Winzer and Williams, 2001; Von Bodman et al., 2003; Antunes
et al., 2010; Rutherford and Bassler; 2012; Papenfort and Bass-
ler, 2016). At another level, it presents an interesting parallel to
the pathoadaptive microniche evolution observed in chronic
cystic fibrosis lung infections involving Pseudomonas aerugi-
nosa, in which mutations accumulate in regulatory systems and
genes responsible for the production of virulence factors that
facilitate acute infection (Smith et al., 2006). This has been pro-
posed to be adaptive because these particular virulence factors
are predicted to be major drivers of inflammatory responses
(Smith et al., 2006). However, it is also conceivable that such ad-
aptations arise simply as a consequence of relaxed selection on
the utility of these virulence factors following initiation of infection
(Winstanley et al., 2016). Of course, since multiple null mutations
cannot readily be reverted, the resulting strains are expected to
be attenuated in terms of their capability to initiate de novo acute
infections. Thus, one advantage of utilizing QS to control the
activity of virulence factors, as highlighted in our study, is that
regulatory control can be maintained over recurrent cycles of
infection until a stable mutualistic association becomes estab-
lished, and the virulence genes are then inactivated and lost in
the process of genome degeneration.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Insects
Sitophilus zeamais weevils (derived from a colony maintained by USDA, Manhattan, KS, U.S.A) were reared on organic whole yellow
maize (Purcell Mountain Farms) in an incubator at 27�C and 60% relative humidity. Symbiont-free (aposymbiotic) weevils were gener-
ated by rearing on rifampicin treated corn prepared by hydrating dried corn with a 3% (w/v) solution of rifampicin (1 mg/ml), prior to
addition of insects. After three generations on this antibiotic supplemented diet, loss of symbionts was confirmed by microscopic
examination of 100 larvae (revealing absence of bacteriomes) and by negative PCR assays on whole weevil DNA using Taq Polymer-
ase MasterMix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using symbiont specific primers (1675 and 1676 in Table S4), with 35 cycles of PCR (95�C

 15 s, 60�C, 30 s, 72�C 30 s). Aposymbiotic insects were subsequently maintained on a normal diet and checked periodically to
confirm the absence of bacteriomes. Newly emerged adult weevils were assigned to experimental treatments groups randomly
with respect to sex.
Bacteria
All experiments in the manuscript were conducted using the type strain of S. praecaptivus described in Clayton et al. (2012) and
deposited at the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) as product BAA-2554. All genetic mutants of S. praecaptivus described
in this study were derived from this strain and cultured in LB media with appropriate antibiotics, at 30�C, unless otherwise described.
S. glossinidius was cultured in MM medium at 25�C. AHL bioassays were conducted using two bacterial reporter strains:
A. tumefaciens strain, KYC55 (Zhu et al., 2003) (pJZ372)(pJZ384)(pJZ410), was cultured in AT medium at 30�C and Chromobacterium
violaceum strain CV026 (McClean et al., 1997) was cultured on LB agar at 30�C.
METHOD DETAILS
Genetic Modification
Gene disruptions/deletions in S. praecaptivus were achieved using the lambda Red recombineering procedure, as described previ-
ously (Datsenko and Wanner, 2000). Constructs were obtained using three step PCR reactions, as follows: Approximately 150
nucleotides of the 50 and the 30 of target genes were amplified by PCR with Phusion High Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) using the oligonucleotides and annealing temperatures listed in Table S4. Identical PCR conditions were employed for all
construction steps unless otherwise indicated. For example, to disrupt ypeI with a Spectinomycin resistance cassette (DypeI::Spc),
primer pairs 232/233 and 234/235 were used. The PCR was performed for 35 cycles (98�C 5 s, 62�C, 30 s, 72�C 20 s) in identical
reactions with and without 5% DMSO. The resulting PCR products were then purified with Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman
Coulter). The 50 and 30 flanking sequences were joined to antibiotic resistance cassettes cassettes (KanR, SpcR, or GenR) using Taq
Polymerase MasterMix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), using the oligonucleotides and annealing temperatures listed in Table S4, in two
steps. The first joining step was performed with only the three dsDNA template fragments in 10 cycles of PCR (95�C 15 s, 45�C, 30 s,
72�C 60 s) to facilitate hybridization. The second assembly step was performed with primer pairs as indicated in Table S4. For
example, to create DypeI::Spc, primer pairs 232/235 were used in a 35 cycle reaction (95�C 15 s, 58�C, 30 s, 72�C 60 s). The
PCR products were again purified with Agencourt AMPure XP beads. The resulting dsDNA fragments were electroporated into an
S. praecaptivus strain harboring the lambda Red-Gamm plasmid, pRed/Gamm (CAT). For transformation, S. praecaptivus cultures
were grown in 25 mL 2YT5.8 media (20 g/l Tryptone, 8 g/l Yeast Extract, 10 g/l NaCl, adjusted to pH 5.8) until OD600 reached �0.4
units. Expression of lambda Red-Gamm proteins was then induced by addition of 0.4% arabinose for 30 min. Cells were harvested
and washed twice in ice-cold sterile water. DNA was electroporated into cells using an Eppendorf electroporator model 2510, at 1600
V/s. Following a six-hour recovery in LB medium, recombinant clones were then selected by plating on LB agar with the appropriate
antibiotic(s). Gene disruptions were verified by PCR with Taq Polymerase MasterMix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with primers pairs and
annealing temperatures listed in Table S4. For example DypeI::Spc was verified with primer pairs 236/138 and 237/139 in a 35 cycle
reaction (95�C 15 s, 58�C, 30 s, 72�C 30 s). The resulting PCR products were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads and
sequenced using the Sanger method to confirm the integrity of junctions between the antibiotic resistance marker and the bacterial
chromosome.
OHHL Extraction and TLC Assay
OHHL extraction was performed on cultures of S. glossinidius (grown in liquid MM medium) and S. praecaptivus (grown in LB me-
dium) were pelleted by centrifugation (8,000 g, 20 min., 4�C) once their turbidities reached an O.D600 of �0.4 units. The resulting cul-
ture supernatants were filtered through 0.22 micron pore-size membrane filters (Argos Technologies) and then extracted by shaking
with an equal volume of ethyl acetate for 30 min. The ethyl acetate extracts were dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered.
The solvent was then evaporated using a vacuum centrifuge at 60�C and the OHHL-containing residue was resuspended in 100 mL
methanol. These extracts were then subjected to TLC on a C18 reverse-phase plate (Whatman) using methanol:water (60:40) as the
solvent/carrier. Following development, the plate was dried and overlaid with a live culture of A. tumefaciens strain KYC55 (pJZ372;
pJZ384; pJZ410) (Zhu et al., 2003). For the C. violaceum AHL reporter assay, strain CV026 was streaked alongside S. praecaptivus on
LB agar and incubated at 30�C for 48 hr.
OHHL Bioassays
The S. praecaptivus strains were cultured overnight in 4.5 mL LB liquid media. Bacteria from these cultures were pelleted, washed
twice in 25 mL LB and resuspended in 20 mL fresh media to yield OD600 of 0.025 units. During a 12 hr incubation with shaking at
200 rpm and 30�C, the cultures were sampled every two hours to determine cell densities and to assay for the presence of OHHL
with the b-galactosidase activity assay using an A. tumefaciens acyl-HSL reporter strain, as described previously (Zhu et al.,
2003). Specifically, the culture was cleared of cells by centrifugation at 16,000 x g for 2 min. 20 ml of 10-fold serial dilutions of the
supernatant were added to 180 ml of the preinduced reporter strain and incubated at 30�C for 16 hr without shaking. The b-galacto-
sidase assays were performed on 100 ml of the reporter cell cultures. To estimate the concentration of OHHL in WT S. praecaptivus

 culture media at OD600 of 0.4, OHHL extraction was performed from total culture supernatant into 200 mL of methanol, which was then
used as substrate in the A. tumefaciens b-galactosidase assay. Solutions of 50, 500 and 1250 nM OHHL (Sigma Aldrich, K3255) were
prepared in methanol for use as standards. The concentration of OHHL in the OD600 = 0.4 culture was determined to be �1 mg
OHHL/ml.
Transcriptomics
For transcriptomics, triplicate (biological replicate) 20 mL cultures of S. praecaptivus were grown in LB media, at 200 rpm shaking
and 30�C, with or without supplementation with OHHL (10 mg/ml). Total nucleic acid was extracted from each culture using Triton
X-100, following four hours of exposure (or lack of exposure) to OHHL for the comparison involving the DypeI strain, or after five
hours of growth for the comparisons involving the WT strain (supplemented with OHHL) and the DypeR and DyenR strains. RNA
was then purified using the Purelink RNA minikit (Ambion). The resulting RNA was then analyzed using an Agilent bioanalyzer to
ensure that it lacked DNA contamination and was of sufficient quality for cDNA preparation. Sequencing libraries were prepared
using the Illumina TruSeq method and sequencing on a HiSeq instrument (Illumina). The resulting quality fitered 50-base single
reads were mapped to the reference genome using bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) employing the–very-sensitive preset.
Read counts mapping to individual genes were generating using HTSeq (Anders et al., 2015) by running htseq-count using
the options -s no -a 0 -m intersection-nonempty -t gene. Next, using custom Perl scripts, counts from three biological replicate
cultures were combined and subject to statistical analysis. After normalization, the combined counts files were compared using
DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014).
Chitinase Assay
Chitinase activities in the S. praecaptivus culture supernatants were measured using a fluorimetric assay (Sigma-Aldrich, CS1030)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were grown in LB media (15 mL volume), from a starting OD600 of 0.05, with
200 rpm shaking at 30�C until O.D 600 reached �1 unit. 10 mL of culture supernatant was added to 90 mL of the substrate working
solution (containing 4-methylumbelliferyl b-D-N, N-diacetylchitobioside hydrate) in a 96-well fluorescence plate (Greiner Bio-One,
655096) and incubated for 60 min at 37�C in the dark. The reaction was stopped by adding 200 mL of sodium carbonate buffer,
and the fluorescence was measured with a SynergyMx plate reader (BioTek Instruments) within 15 min of the reaction end point.
The chitinase activity was calculated using a 4-methyl umbelliferone standard.
Growth Suppression Assays
Plate growth assays were performed by spotting appropriate dilutions of overnight cultures on LB agar plates (lacking NaCl to inhibit
swarming motility). OHHL was dissolved in methanol and added to sterile paper strips or pipetted directly onto plates. One recom-
binant S. praecaptivus strain, maintaining a pCM66 plasmid expressing ypeI in a DyenR background, overproduces OHHL without
undergoing growth suppression and was also used as a source of OHHL by streaking it onto plates. A control strain was also utilized
that maintains an empty pCM66 plasmid in a DypeI background and therefore does not produce any OHHL. All plates were main-
tained at 30�C and observed for growth at daily intervals. Liquid assays were performed by maintaining triplicate cultures of WT
and mutant strains of S. praecaptivus in LB media at 30�C with shaking at 200 rpm in the presence of 1 mg/ml OHHL and recording
turbidity (OD600nm) at hourly intervals
Weevil Microinjection
Newly emerged adult aposymbiotic weevils were microinjected with capillary tubes (3.500 Drummond # 3-000-203-G/X, Drummond
Scientific Company) that were pulled to create a short sharp tip (Bee-Stinger needle) with Micropipette puller P-97 (Sutter Instru-
ments). The settings on the micropipette puller were as follows: Heat = 292, Pull = 100, Velocity = 60, Time = 250, Pressure =
500. Weevils were immobilized by a brief incubation on ice and the needle was immersed in 50 ml of overnight bacterial culture to
collect bacteria by capillary action. The needle was then used to pierce the weevil in the thoracic region between the middle and
hind legs. This resulted in a median 2800 bacterial cells being transferred into each weevil, as determined by plating weevil homog-
enates directly after injection. Following injection, weevils were then transferred to hydrated maize grains and maintained in an
incubator at 27�C and 60% relative humidity.
Weevil Motility Assay
Individual weevils were placed in the center of an empty petri dish and the time taken for them to move from the center of the dish to
the periphery was recorded. Weevils that displayed no sign of movement during the assay were excluded.
Bacterial Isolation from Weevils
Surface contaminants were removed from weevils by immersing the adult insects in a solution of 10% bleach for 5 min with agitation.
Weevils were then air-dried and homogenized in 100 ml of sterile water. A bacterial dilution series was plated on LB agar (without
NaCl) containing 50 mg/ml polymyxin B to select for S. praecaptivus.

 QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Transcriptomics
RNA-Seq experiments were carried out in triplicate using independent bacterial cultures. Complete datasets derived from DESeq2-
based analysis of RNaseq data are presented in Table S1.
Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using the R software package. Data from chitinase assays were analyzed by ordinary one-way
ANOVA comparisons. The numbers of insects used in the weevil microinjection experiments are reported in Table S2, along with
their median lifespan. Pairwise log-rank tests were performed to compare lifespan of weevils injected with different strains of
S. praecaptivus using the data summarized in Table S2. The results of these statistical analyses are presented in Table S3. The
box and whisker plots presented in Figures 4D and 4E were obtained using the geom_boxplot function in R using the ggplot2 pack-
age. Statistical analysis of data relating to weevil infection at 7 days post microinjection (Figure 4F) was performed using a likelihood
ratio test under the log-linear model in R. The numbers of insects sampled for this analysis are presented at the top of the figure panel.
The numbers of insects sampled for bacterial quantification (Figure 4D; for data presented from left to right) were 10, 10, 10, 10, 10,
10, 10, 10, 12, 10, 10, 10, 12, 12, 12, 12, 9, 10, 10, 10, 2, 10, 9. For Figure 4E (left to right) the numbers were 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 6, 8, 5.
