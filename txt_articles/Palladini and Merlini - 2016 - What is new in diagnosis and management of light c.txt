Light chain (AL) amyloidosis is caused by a
usually small plasma cell clone producing a
misfolded light chain that deposits in tis-
sues. Survival is mostly determined by the
severity of heart involvement. Recent stud-
ies are clarifying the mechanisms of cardiac
damage, pointing to a toxic effect of amyloi-
dogenic light chains and offering new
potential therapeutic targets. The diagnosis
requires adequate technology, available at
referral centers, for amyloid typing. Late
diagnosis results in approximately 30%
of patients presenting with advanced,
irreversible organ involvement and dying in
a few months despite modern treatments.
The availability of accurate biomarkers of
clonal and organ disease is reshaping the
approach to patients with AL amyloidosis.
Screening of early organ damage based on
biomarkers can help identify patients with
monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
significance who are developing AL amy-
loidosis before they become symptomatic.
Staging systems and response assessment
based on biomarkers facilitate the design
and conduction of clinical trials, guide the
therapeutic strategy, and allow the timely
identification of refractory patients to be
switched to rescue therapy. Treatment
should be risk-adapted. Recent studies are
linking specific characteristics of the plasma
cell clone to response to different types of
treatment, moving toward patient-tailored
therapy. In addition, novel anti-amyloid
treatments are being developed that
might be combined with anti-plasma cell
chemotherapy. (Blood. 2016;128(2):159-168)
Introduction
Amyloidoses are protein conformational diseases caused by misfolding
and aggregation of autologous proteins that deposit in tissues in the form
of amyloid fibrils.More than 30 different proteins have been identified as
possiblecausesofamyloidosis,andmassspectrometry-baseddiagnostics
are constantly increasing this number. Amyloid deposition can be sys-
temic or localized, such as in cerebral amyloidoses (the most frequent
being Alzheimer disease) and in localized light chain (AL) amyloidosis,
mostly involving the airways, skin, and urinary tract, which usually does
not require systemic therapy.1,2 The most common forms of systemic
amyloidosesarelistedinTable1.ALamyloidosisaccountsformorethan
three-fourths of patients and is caused by a plasma cell clone that in
approximately 50% of cases infiltrates the bone marrow by less than
10%. This is the most frequent of a large group of rare diseases char-
acterized by organ damage caused by the monoclonal protein produced
bysmalldangerousplasmacellclones.3Thesediseasescantargetseveral
organs, and those involving the kidney have recently been grouped in the
category of monoclonal gammopathies of renal significance.4 In the last
decade, improvements in the understanding of the pathogenesis of organ
damage were accompanied by the availability of accurate biomarkers of
clonal and organ disease and by the development of novel therapeutic
agents. This resulted in a rapidly changing approach to patients with
improvement of long-term survival over time, as reported by our group
and others.5-7 In recent series, 4-year overall survival ranges from 40%
to 60%. However, no improvement was observed in early mortality
resulting from advanced cardiac damage, with approximately 30% of
patients dying within 1 year from diagnosis.
Diagnosis
Several organs can be involved by AL amyloidosis (Table 1), and
clinical presentation and outcome depend on the pattern and severity of
organ involvement. The clinical manifestations of systemic AL amy-
loidosis are protean and are usually a consequence of advanced organ
damage, mimicking other more common conditions of the elderly.
Thus, although combinations such as heart failure and nephrotic syn-
drome or “left ventricular hypertrophy” on echocardiography without
consistent electrocardiographic evidence should raise suspicion of this
disease,ALamyloidosisisoftendiagnosedlate.Arecentstudyrevealed
that in almost 40% of cases, the disease is diagnosed more than 1 year
after the onset of symptoms.8 This delay explains the high proportion
(;30%) of subjects who present with advanced, irreversible organ
damageanddiewithin12monthsfromdiagnosis,despiteimprovement
of treatment approaches over time.9,10 The availability of biomarkers
of presymptomatic organ damage, N-terminal pro-natriuretic peptide
type-B (NT-proBNP), with 100% diagnostic sensitivity in cardiac AL
amyloidosis,11 and albuminuria for renal involvement, prompted us to
advocate a biomarker-based screening in patients with monoclonal
gammopathy of undetermined significance and abnormal free light
chain(FLC)ratiowhoareatriskofdevelopingALamyloidosis,aiming
at reducing late diagnoses and improving survival.9,12
The conditions leading to suspect systemic amyloidosis and the
procedures required for diagnosis are summarized in Figure 1. The
diagnosis requires the demonstration of amyloid deposits in a tissue
biopsy. With an 81% diagnostic sensitivity in AL amyloidosis,13
abdominal fat is the most easily accessible biopsy site and can be
innocuously aspirated. In case of a strong clinical suspicion, biopsies
should be obtained at additional sites in patients with negative fat
aspirate. The biopsy of a minor salivary gland can also be easily ob-
tained and can identify almost 60% of patients with systemic amyloid-
osis and negative abdominal fat.14 If necessary, the involved organ can
be biopsied after careful assessment of hemostasis. Biopsy of the
amyloid-loaded liver may result in fatal bleeding, and the transjugular
route is recommended.

From 
 Common types of systemic amyloidoses have overlapping clinical
presentations (Table 1), but require radically different treatments,
and non-AL amyloidoses need to be unequivocally ruled out before
starting anti-plasma cell chemotherapy. Novel treatment approaches
have been recently developed for ATTR, the most common form of
systemic non-AL amyloidosis, such as TTR tetramer stabilizers, gene
silencing by small interfering RNAs and antisense oligonucleotides,
small molecules (eg, doxycycline, epigallocatechin gallate) inter-
fering with aggregation and targeting the fibrils, and anti-amyloid
antibodies.15 The availability of these new agents makes it even more
important to accurately and unequivocally characterize the amyloid
deposits to address patients to appropriate specific treatment and avoid
inadequate and potentially harmful therapy. However, in the presence
of a plasma cell clone in patients with a clinical presentation strongly
suggesting AL amyloidosis (subjects with concomitant proteinuria
and heart involvement or with periorbital purpura and/or macro-
glossia), when prompt intervention is needed, it is reasonable to start
treatment pending the results of tissue typing. The characterization of
amyloid deposits requires adequate technology and expertise, and
patients should be referred to specialized centers. Light microscopy
immunohistochemistry with commercial antibodies lacks specific-
ity,16 but can correctly classify almost 95% of patients when
performed with custom-made antibodies at highly specialized
centers.17 Commercial antibodies can be used in immunoelectron mi-
croscopy. This technique can achieve 100% specificity and can cor-
rectly classify more than 99% of patients with systemic amyloidosis.13
Being not antibody-dependent, mass spectrometry-based proteomics
can overcome the limitations of light microscopy immunohistochem-
istry, greatly improving the diagnostic accuracy.18 Mass spectrometry
diagnostics can be performed after laser capture microdissection
of Congo red-positive areas from slides obtained from paraffin-
embedded tissue19 or on protein extracted from the whole sample.20
Gene sequencing is needed to rule out or confirm possible hereditary
amyloidoses. Cardiac scintigraphy with bone tracers (99mTc-3,3-
diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid or pyrophosphate) can
differentiate AL (mild or no uptake) from transthyretin amyloidosis
(strong uptake) and can spare cardiac biopsy, particularly in elderly
men with ATTRwt (formerly senile systemic amyloidosis).21
Because of the small size of the plasma cell clone, the identification
of the amyloidogenic light chains requires the combination of im-
munofixation of both serum and urine and measurement of FLCs.22-24
Promising high-resolution mass spectrometry methods to identify and
quantify monoclonal light chains are being developed that will flank
current tools in the diagnosis and follow-up.25 Bone marrow biopsies
should be obtained, and immunofluorescence in situ hybridization of
plasma cells might offer guidance to the therapeutic approach.
Prognostic stratification and risk assessment
Heart involvement has the greatest effect on survival, and major
advances have been made in understanding the mechanism of cardiac
damage. Recent evidence points to a cardiotoxic effect of the circulat-
ing precursor. The infusion of light chains from patients with cardiac
involvement increases, in a matter of minutes, end-diastolic pressure
in isolated mouse hearts.26 The processes through which extracellular
light chains lead to cardiac cell pathology are still under investiga-
tion, although increased apoptosis, oxidative stress, altered calcium
handling, and activation of specific signal transduction pathways have
been reported.27,28 Moreover, in patients in whom chemotherapy
reduces the concentration of the amyloidogenic circulating light chain,
cardiac dysfunction improves, despite the amyloid load remaining
unaltered.11,29 Animal models showed that light chains from patients
with cardiac involvement cause a reduction of cardiac output and early
mortality in zebrafish28 and reduce the pumping rate of Caenorhabditis
elegans’ pharynx, an ortholog of vertebrates’ heart with autonomous
contractile activity, reminiscent of cardiac myocytes.30 An interaction
of amyloidogenic light chains with mitochondrial proteins in cardiac
cells, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and damage, has been
proven.31 Recently, it has been suggested that amyloid fibrils can
also impair the metabolism of cardiomyocytes.32 Amyloidogenic light
chains cause oxidative stress, and eventually cell death, via a p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade.33,34 The fact that a
p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent pathway also pro-
motes the synthesis of BNP35 provides a robustpathogenicbackground

The amyloid types are identified by acronyms, where the letter “A” for amyloidosis is followed by the abbreviation of the protein forming the amyloid fibrils. The relative
incidence is calculated on 2548 patients with systemic amyloidosis referred to the Pavia Amyloidosis Research and Treatment Center between 1986 and 2015, unless
indicated otherwise. ALECT2 amyloidosis is a recently identified amyloidosis with a relatively high incidence in Hispanic and Native American people. No cases have been
reported in Europe so far. AApoAI amyloidosis has a high prevalence in northern Italy. The proportion of patients with wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRwt), senile,
amyloidosis is steadily increasing in recent years, mainly because of the recognition that scintigraphy with bone tracers can detect cardiac ATTR.

(NT-proBNP) as markers of cardiac dysfunction in this disease.
The current validated staging systems for AL amyloidosis are
reported in Table 2. Patients’ survival is extremely heterogeneous:
patients without heart involvement can survive many years even if they
do not respond to treatment, whereas most patients with advanced
cardiac damage die in a matter of few weeks.Kidney involvement does
not have a major effect on survival, but limits quality of life and access
to effective treatments. We have recently validated a staging system for
renalinvolvement,basedonestimatedglomerularfiltrationrate(eGFR)
and proteinuria, that is able to predict the risk for dialysis.36 The cardiac
biomarkers NT-proBNP and troponins are powerful predictors of
survival. They are combined in a simple, yet accurate staging system
that is still the most widely used system for individual patient manage-
mentandstratificationinclinicaltrials.37AmongstageIIIsubjects,high
concentrations of NT-proBNP (.8500 ng/L) or hypotension identify
patients with very advanced disease and poor outcome, with most
of them dying within a few weeks from diagnosis.38 A limitation of
NT-proBNP-based staging systems is the effect of renal failure on the
concentration of this biomarker. This interference can be partly over-
come by using BNP in subjects with low eGFR (,30 mL/min per
1.73 m2).39 A specific staging system combining liver involvement and

Figure 1. Diagnostic workup of systemic AL amyloidosis. Systemic amyloidosis can be suspected on the basis of symptoms of organ involvement or during biomarker-based
follow-up of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Imaging is crucial in identifying heart involvement. The echocardiographic features of advanced cardiac
amyloidosis are distinctive, with nondilated ventricles showing thickening of ventricular walls, as well as of interventricular and interatrial septa; amyloid infiltration gives a
characteristic “granular sparkling” aspect to the myocardial texture. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging shows global subendocardial late gadolinium enhancement and
associated abnormal myocardial and blood-pool gadolinium kinetics. Equilibrium contrast magnetic resonance imaging allows quantification of the myocardial extracellular
volume, which is related to amyloid load. Diagnosis is based on tissue biopsy. Less-invasive biopsy sites (abdominal fat, minor salivary glands) can be preferred. Amyloid
deposits need to be characterized by reliable techniques to unequivocally identify amyloid type. Staging of organ dysfunction and characterization of the plasma cell clone
offer guidance to the design of the therapeutic approach. CT, computed tomography; ECG, electrocardiogram; ECV, extracellular volume; DPD, 3,3-diphosphono-

From 
 neuropathy has been designed for AL amyloidosis caused by immu-
noglobulin M-producing clones, a distinct clinical entity characterized
by less common cardiac and more frequent peripheral nervous system
involvement.40 High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T is the single most
powerful biomarker predicting survival, and a staging system based on
it alone has been proposed and is waiting for validation.41-43 The Mayo
Clinic group recently reported that soluble suppression of tumorige-
nicity 2 predicts survival independent of other biomarkers.44 Growth
differentiation factor 15 is also a promising marker of early death and
renal outcomes and is currently being studied.45 Cardiac imaging
contributes to prognostication of survival. In particular, echocardio-
graphic left ventricular strain improves the predictive value of cardiac
biomarkers.46 More recently, myocardial contraction fraction, a simple
index of myocardial shortening obtained from standard echocardiog-
raphy and strongly correlated with left ventricular strain, has been
proposed as a new independent prognostic factor.47
Although the severityof heartinvolvementpredictsmostearly deaths,
within the first year after diagnosis, the biology and burden of the
plasma cell clone affect treatment outcomes and long-term survival.
The difference between involved (amyloidogenic) and uninvolved FLCs
(dFLC) is prognostic and can be integrated in the staging system based on
cardiac biomarkers.48 Recent observations from our group suggest that
patients with high dFLC burden have better outcome when treated with
melphalan, dexamethasone, and bortezomib (BMDex) compared with
melphalan dexamethasone (MDex) or cyclophosphamide, bortezomib,
and dexamethasone (CyBorD).49 The Mayo Clinic investigators showed
that patients with a bone marrow plasma cell infiltrate higher than 10%
have a poor outcome independent of the presence of overt multiple
myeloma.50 Their recent data suggest that these patients are those who
benefit most from induction treatment before autologous stem cell
transplant (ASCT).51 The Heidelberg group identified immunoflu-
orescence in situ hybridization abnormalities that are associated with
treatment outcomes: patients with gain of chromosome 1q21 have
poorer outcome when treated with MDex, whereas translocation
t(11;14) is associated with inferior survival in patients receiving
CyBorD.52,53 Taken together, if confirmed in independent studies,
these data could be useful to guide the choice of treatment, moving
toward a patient-tailored approach.
Treatment
The treatment of AL amyloidosis has been solely based on anti-plasma
cell chemotherapy for many years. By suppressing the plasma cell clone,
chemotherapy reduces the concentration of toxic light chains, which is
necessary to improve organ dysfunction and prolong survival. More
recently, different approaches targeting the amyloid deposits and inter-
fering with organ damage have been developed that are being tested in
clinicaltrials.Theymayrepresentpowerfulcomplementstochemotherapy.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy of AL amyloidosis is based on regimens developed
for multiple myeloma. However, AL amyloidosis is not merely a
hematologic malignancy,and amyloid-related dysfunction of 1 or more
organsnotonlydeterminessurvivalbutalsolimitstheaccessofpatients
to aggressive treatments. This requires a risk-adapted approach, with
dose reductions and schedule modifications of chemotherapy regimens
and a close monitoring of hematologic and organ response. Only a few
controlled studies have been performed in AL amyloidosis, and no
prospective randomized trials of novel agents have been published
so far. Thus, most of the available data derive from retrospective case
series, and results are difficult to compare, given the extreme hetero-
geneity of this disease (Table 3). For this reason, whenever possible,
patients with AL amyloidosis should be treated within clinical trials.
Treatment indications are reported in Figure 2.
A huge international effort has established and validated criteria for
assessmentofhematologic,cardiac,andrenalresponsetotreatmentthat
have been validated in independent series based on patients’ outcomes
(Table4).36,54Thesecriteriaallowthetimelyidentificationofrefractory
patients and can be used as surrogate endpoints in clinical trials,
allowing earlier study completion.55 Response should be assessed
at least every 2 cycles or 3 months after ASCT, measuring FLC and
biomarkers of organ dysfunction. Patients who fail to rapidly achieve
very good partial or complete response or organ response should be
immediately switched to potentially effective second-line treatment.
The introduction of ASCT represented a major step forward in
the treatment of AL amyloidosis.56 However, inappropriate patient

Figure 2. Therapeutic approach to systemic AL amyloidosis. Indications on the therapeutic approach to AL amyloidosis mostly derive from uncontrolled studies. Treatment should
be risk adapted. At our center, 14% of patients are low risk and transplant eligible, 42% are intermediate risk, and 44% are high risk. Of the potential ASCT candidates, 80% receive
frontline CyBorD. Patients with more than 10% bone marrow plasma cell infiltrate benefit most from induction before ASCT. Post-transplant treatment with bortezomib increases the
rate of CR. Characteristics of the amyloidogenic plasma cell clone can guide the choice of chemotherapy: Patients with t(11;14) have a poorer outcome with bortezomib-based therapy,
whereas MDex had a worse performance in subjects with gain of 1q21, and BMDex seems superior to MDex and CyBorD in subjects with elevated (.180 mg/L) dFLC. High-risk
patients do not tolerate full-dose therapy. These patients should receive low-dose combinations. Low-dose weekly (0.7-1.0 mg/m2) bortezomib is preferred in this setting because of its
rapid action. Young patients with isolated advanced cardiac involvement can be considered for heart transplant followed by ASCT. BDex, bortezomib dexamethasone; BMPC, bone

 eligibility for ASCT. Almost all early deaths occur in patients with
cardiac troponin T levels higher than 0.06 ng/mL or NT-proBNP levels
higher than 5000 ng/L, who should not be considered candidates for
ASCT.58 Other eligibility criteria for ASCT used at our center are
reported in Figure 2.9 Similar criteria have been proposed by the Mayo
Clinic group.59 A reduction of the dose of melphalan does not sig-
nificantly reduce TRM, but is associated with response rates lower than
those achievable with less toxic regimens.60 Center experience also
affects TRM, which is significantly higher (7% vs 3%) at institutions
where fewer than 4 transplants are performed every year.57 The
hematologic response rate to ASCT exceeds 70%, with 35% to 37%
of patients obtaining CR.57,61 The Boston University investigators
recently updated their experience with ASCT.61 With a median
follow-up of 8 years, the overall median survival was 7.6 years.
Remarkably, about 55% of patients in CR are projected to be alive at
14 years, with no deaths observed in patients with longer follow-
up.61 This observation raises the hope that a proportion of patients
achieving CR according to the current definition might be cured.
Bortezomib can be used in subjects who fail to achieve CR after
ASCT, increasing the CR rate to almost 60%.62
However, the majority of patients with AL amyloidosis are
not eligible for ASCT. At our center, the standard treatment of
intermediate-risk patients has been oral MDex. We have recently
updated our experience with this regimen.63 With a median follow-up
of 6 years, in patients receiving full-dose dexamethasone, 30% of
whom were cardiac stage I, 60% stage II or IIIa, and 10% stage IIIb, the
median overall survival was 7.3 years. The hematologic response rate
was 76%, with 31% of patients obtaining CR.63 These results are
comparable to that observed with ASCT. The projected survival of
patientsinCRafterMDexismorethan80%at7years.63However,data
on very long term outcome are still lacking. One of the few published
randomized trials in AL amyloidosis compared ASCT and MDex.64
This trial has been criticized because of the very high (24%) TRM that
was ascribed to suboptimal selection of transplant candidates in an era
preceding the use of cardiac biomarkers. Nevertheless, a landmark
analysis excluding early deaths failed to demonstrate a survival advan-
tage of one treatment over the other.64 The availability of bortezomib
raised great expectation because proteasome inhibitors were thought to
be targeted therapy for amyloidogenic plasma cells relying on the
proteasome to cope with the proteotoxicity imposed by the misfolded
light chain.65 Prospective trials and large retrospective series proved the
efficacy and tolerability of bortezomib in AL amyloidosis.66,67 More
recently, 2 retrospective series showed unprecedented hematologic
response rates (up to 90%, with 60%-65% CRs) in treatment-naive
patients receiving CyBorD.68,69 Subsequently, 2 retrospective matched
case-control studies confirmed higher response rates with regimens
combining bortezomib, dexamethasone, and alkylating agents (BMDex
and CyBorD) compared with standard MDex or cyclophosphamide/
thalidomide/dexamethasone (CTD), but failed to demonstrate an
overall survival advantage.70,71 An international, randomized phase 3
study comparing MDex and BMDex will be completed next year
(NCT01277016). An interim analysis showed a higher hematologic
response rate with BMDex (76% vs 54%; P 5 .04), which has not
translated into a survival advantage so far.72 We recently published the
largest series of patients treated with CyBorD.73 The overall response
rate was 60%, and 23% of patients attained CR. Response rates de-
creasedwithincreasingcardiacstage(Table3)asaresultofearlydeaths
and because of the unfeasibility of full-dose treatment.73
So far, no treatment approach has been able to improve the overall
outcome of patients with very advanced cardiac involvement (Table 3).
However, even these unfortunate subjects can enjoy a prolonged sur-
vival ifthey respond to treatment, as observed inapproximately20% of
patients.73 These subjects do not tolerate high doses of dexamethasone
and bortezomib, and should be treated with low-dose combination
regimens carefully increasing drug dosages on a week-by-week basis.
Immune-modulatorydrugs(IMiDs)havefoundtheirplaceinrescue
treatmentofpatientsrefractorytoupfrontregimensorthosewhorelapse
but cannot repeat frontline therapy. Lenalidomide and pomalidomide
proved able to overcome resistance to alkylating agents, bortezomib,
and other IMiDs, with overall hematologic response rates ranging from
40% to 60%.74,75 Response rates can be higher when IMiDs are
combined with alkylators, but myelosuppression is significant.76-80
Lenalidomide should be used with caution in patients with relevant
proteinuria or low eGFR.81 An increase in NT-proBNP has been
reported with IMiDs that should be considered when assessing cardiac
response.82 The second-generation oral proteasome inhibitor ixazomib
has been tested in a phase 1/2 trial in relapsed/refractory patients
with AL amyloidosis, showing promising activity, particularly in
bortezomib-naive subjects.83 A randomized phase 3 trial comparing
ixazomib with physician’s best choice is underway (NCT01659658).
An additional option for relapsed/refractory patients is bendamustine.
This drug has been tested in a prospective trial and in a retrospective
series, granting a hematologic response in 40% to 50% of patients.84,85
Bendamustine can be particularly effective in immunoglobulin M-AL
amyloidosis. Novel anti-plasma cell approaches borrowed from multi-
ple myeloma are currently being considered for treating AL amyloid-
osis.Theyincludetheproteasomeinhibitorcarfilzomib,theanti-plasma
cell antibody daratumumab, and the immunostimulatory monoclonal
antibody elotuzumab, targeting signaling lymphocytic activation mol-
ecule F7. The goal of suppressing the production of amyloidogenic
light chains also may be achieved with small interfering RNA targeting
the light chain constant region.86 In turn, this can lead to plasma cell
death resulting from terminal endoplasmic reticulum stress in clones
producing an intact immunoglobulin. The possibility of exploiting the
intracellular quality control mechanisms to selectively reduce the
secretion of misfolded light chains has been recently investigated,
with encouraging results.87 An innovative and very promising
approach conceptually derived from the studies on the stabilization of
the transthyretin tetramer is aiming at stabilizing the amyloidogenic
light chains with small ligands to inhibit their aggregation.88

 Targeting the amyloid deposits and interfering with
amyloidogenesis and organ damage
Nonchemotherapy approaches to the treatment of AL amyloidosis are
now rapidly expanding. We demonstrated that a small molecule, the
anthracycline 49-iodo-49-deoxy-doxorubicin, inhibited amyloidogene-
sis in vitro and could improve the clinical status and promoteresorption
of amyloid deposits in patients with AL amyloidosis.89,90 A compound
with a molecular structure that closely resembles that of 49-iodo-49-
deoxy-doxorubicin, the antibiotic doxycycline, was also shown to
disrupt amyloid fibrils in vitro and to reduce the amyloid load in a
transgenic mouse model.91 Moreover, we recently showed that doxy-
cycline is capable of counteracting the proteotoxicity of amyloidogenic
light chains in the C. elegans model.30 This is relevant to the recent
preliminary report that the addition of doxycycline to chemotherapy
improved survival of patients with stage II/IIIa cardiac AL amyloid-
osis in a small, retrospective case-control study in which patients were
matched based on the severity of the disease, but not chemother-
apy regimen received.92 Doxycycline has the advantage of being a
marketed drug that can be “repurposed” for the treatment of amyloid-
osis, and an international randomized trial comparing chemotherapy
plus doxycycline versus chemotherapy alone is being designed.
The use of polyphenols as inhibitors of fibrillogenesis is also being
considered with interest. A case of improvement in cardiac symptoms
of AL amyloidosis in a patient purposely drinking high amounts of
green tea was reported.93 The clinical activity of epigallocatechin
gallate was then confirmed in retrospective case series, and clinical
trials are underway (NCT01511263, NCT02015312).94
Pepys et al investigated the possibility of promoting amyloid re-
sorption by depleting serum amyloid P component, a common constit-
uent of amyloid deposits, with a palindromic compound, CPHPC, a
competitive inhibitor of serum amyloid P component binding to
amyloid fibrils.95 The first pilot study of combined CPHPC and anti-
serum amyloid P component antibodies in humans has recently been
reported, with encouraging results,96 and a trial based on validated
organ response criteria is eagerly awaited. Hrncic et al have also
explored immunotherapy of systemic amyloidosis. They showed that
infusion of an anti–light chain monoclonal antibody having specificity
for an amyloid-related epitope caused the resolution of amyloidomas
generated in mice by injection of amyloid proteins extracted from the
spleens or livers of patients with AL amyloidosis.97 The encouraging
results of the pilot study of this antibody in humans have been recently
reported.98 A monoclonal antibody (NEOD001) to a cryptic epitope
on amyloid fibrils has been reported to target amyloid deposits and
accelerate the regression of AL k amyloidomas in mice. The first phase
1/2studyofNEOD001inALamyloidosisshowedthatcardiacresponse
rate was 50%, and the renal response rate was 43%.99 A randomized,
placebo-controlled phase 3 trial is underway (NCT02312206).
Supportive therapy
Supportive treatment aimed at maintaining the quality of life and pre-
serving organ function while specific therapy has time to take effect is
also critical. Indications are summarized in Figure 3. Supportive treat-
ment is particularly relevant in patients with advanced heart failure, in
whomitisvitaltosustaincardiacfunctionwhileeffectivespecifictherapy
is delivered. Young patients with isolated advanced heart involvement
can be considered for heart transplant followed by effective treatment.
However, low-dose chemotherapy should be started immediately be-
cause survival on the waiting list is dramatically shorter for patients with
amyloidosis than for other candidates for heart transplant.100
Conclusion
The diagnosis and treatment of AL amyloidosis, as well as the efficient
conduction of clinical trials, require adequate technology and experi-
ence, and patients should be referred to specialized centers and enrolled
in clinical trials whenever possible. In the last few years, the availability
of reliable diagnostic tools, the establishment of biomarker-based risk
assessment, and evaluation of response and novel therapeutic agents
have reshaped the approach to patients with AL amyloidosis. We are
constantly improving long-term outcomes, several groups are studying
the effect of minimal residual disease in AL amyloidosis, and we can
hope that some of our patients may eventually be cured. However,
treatment of patients with advanced cardiac involvement remains a
largely unmet need, and every effort should be made to increase the
Supportive therapy
• Salt restriction.
• Diuretics (cardiac function is preload-dependent: Avoid reduction of  intravascular volume).
• Patients with recurrent arrhythmic syncope may benefit from pacemaker implantation; the use of implantable
  ICD is controversial.
• ACE inhibitors are generally poorly tolerated because of hypotension; Use at lowest tolerated dose.
• Fitted elastic leotards and midodrine for hypotension.
• Gabapentin or pregabalin for neuropathic pain.
• Octreotide can control diarrhea.
• Nutritional support.
Organ transplant can be proposed in patients with irreversible, end-stage organ dysfunction despite CR. In
young patients with isolated cardiac involvement and severe heart failure, heart transplant followed by ASCT
can be considered. Left ventricular assist devices may represent a bridge to cardiac transplant.
Figure 3. Supportive therapy in systemic amyloidosis. Supportive treatment is a fundamental part of the management of patients with systemic AL amyloidosis and is
aimed at sustaining organ function while specific therapy is delivered, as well as at improving quality of life. Transplantation of the organs involved by amyloidosis may render
patients with advanced disease eligible for aggressive specific treatment. The main concerns with organ transplantation are recurrence of amyloidosis in the graft and
progression in other organs. However, the availability of effective anticlone treatments and the ever-improving long-term survival of patients with AL amyloidosis allow
considering organ transplant in an increasing proportion of patients. Heart transplant followed by ASCT or other effective chemotherapy can be the only effective option for
young patients with isolated, severe cardiac involvement. Moreover, organ transplant can be considered in patients who attain complete response, but have irreversible end-
stage organ damage. ACE, angiotensin-converting enzyme; ICD, implantable cardioverter defibrillator.

 proportion of patients who are diagnosed at earlier, treatable stages.
Although the number of ongoing trials is encouraging, our treatment
approach is still largely based on uncontrolled studies. However, the
results of the ongoing trials, coupled with a better understanding of
the amyloid clone, will help establishing the role of novel agents.
Moreover, the clarification of the mechanisms of organ damage will
identify potential alternative therapeutic targets. Thus, we can hope to
witness an early dawn of effective patient-tailored treatment in AL
amyloidosis.
