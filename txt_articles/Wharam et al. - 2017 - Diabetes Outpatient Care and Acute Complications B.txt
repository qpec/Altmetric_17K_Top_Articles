IMPORTANCE High-deductible health plans (HDHPs) have expanded under the Affordable
Care Act and are expected to play a major role in the future of US health policy. The effects of
modern HDHPs on chronically ill patients and adverse outcomes are unknown.
OBJECTIVE To determine the association of HDHP with high-priority diabetes outpatient care
and preventable acute complications.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Controlled interrupted-time-series study using a large
national health insurer database from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2012. A total of
12 084 HDHP members with diabetes, aged 12 to 64 years, who were enrolled for 1 year in a
low-deductible (�$500) plan followed by 2 years in an HDHP (�$1000) after an
employer-mandated switch were included. Patients transitioning to HDHPs were
propensity-score matched with contemporaneous patients whose employers offered only
low-deductible coverage. Low-income (n = 4121) and health savings account (HSA)–eligible
(n = 1899) patients with diabetes were subgroups of interest. Data analysis was performed
from February 23, 2015, to September 11, 2016.
EXPOSURES Employer-mandated HDHP transition.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES High-priority outpatient visits, disease monitoring tests,
and outpatient and emergency department visits for preventable acute diabetes
complications.
RESULTS In the 12 084 HDHP members included after the propensity score match, the mean
(SD) age was 50.4 (10.0) years; 5410 of the group (44.8%) were women. The overall,
low-income, and HSA-eligible diabetes HDHP groups experienced increases in out-of-pocket
medical expenditures of 49.4% (95% CI, 40.3% to 58.4%), 51.7% (95% CI, 38.6% to 64.7%),
and 67.8% (95% CI, 47.9% to 87.8%), respectively, compared with controls in the year after
transitioning to HDHPs. High-priority primary care visits and disease monitoring tests did not
change significantly in the overall HDHP cohort; however, high-priority specialist visits
declined by 5.5% (95% CI, −9.6% to −1.5%) in follow-up year 1 and 7.1% (95% CI, −11.5% to
−2.7%) in follow-up year 2 vs baseline. Outpatient acute diabetes complication visits were
delayed in the overall and low-income HDHP cohorts at follow-up (adjusted hazard ratios,
0.94 [95% CI, 0.88 to 0.99] for the overall cohort and 0.89 [95% CI, 0.81 to 0.98] for the
low-income cohort). Annual emergency department acute complication visits among HDHP
members increased by 8.0% (95% CI, 4.6% to 11.4%) in the overall group, 21.7% (95% CI,
14.5% to 28.9%) in the low-income group, and 15.5% (95% CI, 10.5% to 20.6%) in the
HSA-eligible group.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patients with diabetes experienced minimal changes in
outpatient visits and disease monitoring after an HDHP switch, but low-income and
HSA-eligible HDHP members experienced major increases in emergency department visits
for preventable acute diabetes complications.

H
igh-deductible health plans (HDHPs) have recently be-
come the predominant commercial health insurance
arrangement in the United States.1 These plans have
expanded under the Affordable Care Act and are expected to
play a major role in the future of US health policy. High-
deductible health plans require potential annual out-of-
pocket spending of approximately $1000 to $6000 per per-
son for most nonpreventive services; in 2016, 51% of workers
with employer-sponsored insurance had deductibles of $1000
or more and 23% had deductibles of $2000 or more.1
Diabetesisamajorcauseofmorbidityandprematuredeath

chronicallyillpatientswhorequirefrequentandexpensiveser-
vices. However, the effects of HDHPs on outpatient care
patterns and adverse outcomes among chronically ill pa-
tients are unknown.
We hypothesized that some outpatient care, including
preventive tests that are inexpensive even under HDHPs,
would remain stable among HDHP members with diabetes.
We further hypothesized that relatively expensive care, such
as specialist visits and outpatient visits for acute complica-
tions (typically paid out of pocket until the deductible is
met), would decline or be delayed, increasing the frequency
and severity of emergency department (ED) visits for acute
complications.
Methods
Study Population
We drew our study population from commercially insured
members in the Optum database (Eden Prairie, Minnesota) en-
rolled between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2012. Data
comprised enrollment tables and all medical, pharmacy, and
hospitalization claims from members of a large national health
plan. We included members in the study based on their em-
ployers’healthinsuranceofferings.Wedefinedemployerswith
low- and high-deductible coverage as those offering exclu-
sively annual deductibles of $500 or less or $1000 or more, re-
spectively (eAppendix in the Supplement). To determine em-
ployers’annual deductibles, we used a benefits variable that
was available for most smaller employers (approximately ≤100
employees, representing 57.7% of account years) that in-
cludedinformationsuchasin-networkandout-of-networkde-
ductible,copayment,andcoinsuranceamounts.Forlargerem-
ployers(42.4%ofaccountyears),weimputeddeductiblelevels
using out-of-pocket spending among employees who used
health services with an algorithm that had 96.2% sensitivity
and 97.0% specificity (eTable 1 in the Supplement). The re-
search protocol, with waiver of informed consent, was ap-
proved by the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care institutional re-
view board.
Both low- and high-deductible plans often cover a single
annual preventive primary care visit and disease monitoring,
suchashemoglobinA1ctesting,atlowornoout-of-pocketcost.1
In contrast, HDHP members on average must pay substan-
tially higher amounts than low-deductible members for spe-
cialist, acute care, and ED visits.
Our study groups were drawn from individuals whose em-
ployers mandated an HDHP switch (HDHP group) or man-
dated continuation in low-deductible plans (control group),
minimizing self-selection. We required HDHP group mem-
bers to have 12 baseline months in a low-deductible plan fol-
lowed by 24 months in an HDHP after the employer-
mandatedHDHPswitch(36continuousenrollmentmonthsper
member). We defined the beginning of the month of the low-
to high-deductible transition as the index date. We identified
all potential control group members whose employers of-
fered only low-deductible plans over at least a 3-year period
(n = 1 674 527).
To further minimize potential selection effects, espe-
cially at the employer level, we used a 2-level (employer and
member level) propensity score–matching approach4,5 (eAp-
pendix in the Supplement) and estimated propensity scores
predicting the likelihood of a mandated HDHP switch. After
matching at the employer level on multiple characteristics
(eAppendix in the Supplement), we identified patients with
diabetes aged 12 to 64 years using a standard claims-based
algorithm (eTable 2 in the Supplement) (12 854 HDHP mem-
bers and 69 749 control pool members) (Table 1). We
included patients who first met the diabetes diagnosis algo-
rithm criteria at least 6 months before the index date and
who had diabetes diagnoses or medication use between 6
months before and 6 months after the beginning of the base-
line year.
Within quartiles of the employer propensity score, we
matched HDHP members with diabetes at the patient level 1:1
to controls with diabetes based on age, adjusted clinical group
(ACG)morbidityscore,6,7monthoffirstdiabetesdiagnosis,em-
ployer size, and index month. We also matched on baseline
quarterly numbers of high-priority (defined below) primary
care and specialist visits, preventable acute diabetes compli-
cation visits (defined below), ED visits, hospitalization days,
and total out-of-pocket spending per member.8,9 Compared
with the unmatched sample, our propensity score-matching
approach increased the similarity of the HDHP and control
groups with respect to age, sex, neighborhood poverty level,
morbidity score, baseline outpatient copayment, and em-
ployer size (Table 1). Our final group included 12 084 HDHP
members with diabetes and their 1:1 matched controls.
Key Points
Question How does high-deductible insurance enrollment affect
diabetes outpatient care and acute complications?
Findings In this controlled interrupted-time-series study that
included 24 168 patients with diabetes, high-deductible health
plan members experienced minimal changes in outpatient visits
and disease monitoring. However, low-income and health savings
account–eligible high-deductible health plan members
experienced statistically significant increases in emergency
department visits for preventable acute diabetes complications.
Meaning Vulnerable patients with diabetes switching to
high-deductible insurance experienced major increases in acute
diabetes complications and might require protection under
improved health insurance designs.

Our primary subgroups of interest, based on previous evi-
dence of adverse HDHP effects,10,11 included high-morbidity
(n = 3640) and low-income (n = 4121) patients with diabetes
(defined below). We also assessed HDHP members who were
eligible to have health savings accounts (HSAs) because such
plans are rapidly increasing in prevalence and have the high-
est out-of-pocket obligations among commercial insurance
plans.1 The HSAs allow pretax contributions from employers
or members—funds that can be used to pay for qualified medi-
cal expenses.12
Design
We used 3 different study designs depending on the outcome
type. We applied a before-after with comparison group de-
sign to assess outpatient visits and disease monitoring. To de-
tect changes in the timing of acute, preventable diabetes com-
plication visits, we applied a controlled time-to-event design
to the baseline and follow-up periods. A controlled, cumula-
tive, monthly interrupted-time-series design was used to ex-
amine rates of and total expenditures for acute complication
episodes.
Measures
Utilization and Disease Monitoring Measures
We used standard algorithms for detecting outpatient visits
with Current Procedural Terminology evaluation and manage-
ment codes and a clinician type variable to classify visits as pri-
mary care or specialist. We then applied a taxonomy devel-
oped by Fenton and colleagues13 (eAppendix in the
Supplement) to characterize each office visit as high priority

or low priority based on the primary diagnosis. High-priority
diagnoses are considered more likely to benefit from medical
care, although the measure is not intended to reflect the ap-
propriateness of particular visits. Outpatient disease monitor-
ing measures were captured based on Healthcare Effective-
ness Data and Information Set14 specifications, including 1 or
more annual primary care visit; hemoglobin A1c, low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol, and microalbumin test; and retinal eye
examination (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Health Outcome Measures
To assess whether HDHPs were associated with changes in
time-sensitive care, 2 of us (J.F.W and E.M.E.) used a system-
atic approach to develop a measure of outpatient and ED vis-
its that could indicate a preventable acute diabetes complica-
tion, hereinafter termed complication visit (eAppendix and
eTable 4 in the Supplement). Acute diabetes complications
were defined as symptoms or conditions (when coded by cli-
nicians as the primary diagnosis) that could be associated with
delaying recommended or urgent diabetes-related outpa-
tient or ED care (including prescription drug use) for up to 4
months and that require timely care by medical professionals
(eFigure 1 in the Supplement). This measure was validated in
our population (eTables 5 and 6 in the Supplement) by deter-
mining that outpatient and ED visits with these complication
diagnoses were associated with odds ratios of 4.10 (95% CI,
3.98-4.23) for outpatient visits and 3.02 (95% CI, 2.96-3.08)
forEDvisitsofsubsequenthospitalizationcomparedwithother
types of outpatient or ED visits. The 5 most common catego-
ries of outpatient complication visits at baseline, accounting
for 82.0% of such visits, were cellulitis, urinary tract infec-
tion, angina and ischemic heart disease, acute cerebrovascu-
lar disease, and pneumonia. The 5 most common categories
of ED complication visits at baseline, accounting for 62.0% of
such visits, were cellulitis, urinary tract infection, hypoglyce-
mia or hyperglycemia and their major acute complications, an-
gina and ischemic heart disease, and pneumonia.
Allhealthcareexpendituresduringthe7daysafteranacute
complication visit to the ED were summed as a health out-
come measure to assess the intensity of and need for diagnos-
ticandtherapeuticservices.Thatis,weincludedthisasaproxy
to indicate level of “sickness” at presentation to the ED. Health
care expenditures were from a data vendor-provided vari-
able that was standardized across geography and time and rep-
resents combined health plan and patient payments.
Covariates
We applied the Johns Hopkins ACG System comorbidity score
(version 10.0.1) algorithm, a validated measure that predicts
mortality,6,15 to members’baseline year to estimate comor-
bidity and defined high and low morbidity as ACG scores of 3.0
or higher and lower than 2.0, respectively. Using 2000 US Cen-
susblockgroupdataandvalidatedmethods,16,17memberswere
considered high and low income based on living in neighbor-
hoods with below-poverty levels of less than 5% and 10% or

west, South, and Northeast).
Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics of our study groups were compared
using χ2 tests; unpaired, 2-tailed t tests; and nonparametric
tests.Continuousmeasuresarereportedasmean(SD),andcat-
egorical variables are reported as count (percentage).24 In all
statistical models estimating HDHP effects, we removed from
analyses the month before and after the index date to reduce
biasduetoanticipatoryincreasesinutilizationbeforetheHDHP
switch (and consequent reductions in the month after the
switch).
For the high-priority primary care and specialist visit out-
comes, we first fit interrupted-time-series models25 to both vi-
sually display monthly trends and confirm that the study
groups did not have differential baseline trends—a key as-
sumption of difference-in-differences analysis. We then used
difference-in-differences analysis to examine changes in an-
nual high-priority outpatient visits and disease monitoring
measures. Generalized estimating equation26,27 models with
a negative binomial distribution for outpatient visits and a bi-
nary distribution for disease monitoring measures were ap-
plied, controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, educational level,
poverty level, US region, ACG score, employer size, and index
date.
To examine time to first outpatient and ED visits for acute
complications, we used separate Cox proportional hazards re-
gression models for the baseline and follow-up periods, ad-
justing for the same covariates as listed above. To analyze an-
nual changes in complication visits and subsequent 7-day total
expenditures, aggregate-level segmented regression was ap-
plied to cumulative rates that had been adjusted for the above
covariates (eAppendix in the Supplement).
Usingthesamemethodsandoutcomesasdescribedabove,
subgroup analyses stratified by low and high income and mor-
bidity were performed and HSA-eligible members and their
matched pairs were examined. We also assessed several other
subgroups of interest, including those defined by different in-
comecutofflevels(residinginneighborhoodswith<10%,>5%,
and >20% of households below the federal poverty level) and
residents of predominantly white and nonwhite race neigh-
borhoods. As a sensitivity analysis, we restricted the sample
to members aged 18 to 64 years, rematched, and then ana-
lyzed all primary outcomes. Data analysis was performed from
February 23, 2015, to September 11, 2016. Statistical analysis
was performed using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc) and
Stata, version 12.1 (StataCorp).

four percent to 35% of members lived in low-income neigh-
borhoods; 25% lived in low-education neighborhoods; 10.7%
and 11.5% were Hispanic members, respectively; and the mean
(SD)ACGmorbidityscorewas2.8(3.5)forbothgroups.Atbase-
line, HDHP and control members had unadjusted mean, high-
priority, primary care visit rates of 2.04 and 2.05 (P = .69) per
member per year, respectively, and corresponding high-
priority specialist visit rates of 1.38 and 1.38 (P = .94), respec-
tively.
Changes in Out-of-Pocket Expenditures
Mean out-of-pocket medical expenditures increased by 49.4%
(95% CI, 40.3%-58.4%; absolute, $374.6) in the overall HDHP
cohort, by 56.8% (95% CI, 45.8%-67.8%; absolute, $292.0) in
the low-morbidity group, by 40.9% (95% CI, 31.5%-50.4%; ab-
solute, $448.8) in the high-morbidity group, by 48.4% (95%
CI, 37.2%-59.6%; absolute, $361.8) in the high-income group,
by 51.7% (95% CI, 38.6%-64.7%; absolute, $400.4) in the low-
income group, and by 67.8% (95% CI, 47.9%-87.8%; absolute,
$463.0) in the HSA HDHP group compared with controls in the
year after transitioning to HDHPs (eTable 7 in the Supple-
ment). Out-of-pocket obligations for hemoglobin A1c, low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol, and microalbumin tests in-
creased from a mean of $1.2 to $1.4 at baseline among HDHP
members to $2.2 to $4.8 at follow-up (eTable 8 in the Supple-
ment). Primary care visit costs increased from $15.4 to $23.3
to $26.8 from baseline to follow-up among HDHP members,
and the mean cost of specialist visits was $23.3 at baseline and
approximately $42.0 at follow-up.
Utilization and Disease Monitoring Measures
Interrupted-time-series analyses demonstrated no statisti-
cally significant baseline trend differences between the HDHP
and control groups in high-priority outpatient visits for all sub-
groups (implying validity of difference-in-differences esti-
mates; eTable 9 in the Supplement) except primary care vis-
its among low-morbidity members. In adjusted difference-in-
differences analyses, relative changes in high-priority primary
care visits occurred only in the low-morbidity (−5.1%; 95% CI,
−8.6% to −1.6%), high-income (−5.7%; 95% CI, −10.5% to
−0.9%), and low-income (−5.2%; 95% CI, −9.8% to −0.7%) sub-
groups from baseline to follow-up year 2 (Table 2; eFigure 2
in the Supplement).
High-priority specialist visits declined in the overall HDHP
cohort by 5.5% (95% CI, −9.6% to −1.5%) in follow-up year 1
and 7.1% (95% CI, −11.5% to −2.7%) in follow-up year 2 vs base-
line. Among the low- and high-morbidity HDHP subgroups
compared with controls, year 2 vs baseline changes in high-
priority specialist visits were −7.9% (95% CI, −14.4% to −1.4%)
for the low-morbidity subgroup and −12.2% (95% CI, −17.9%
to −6.5%) for the high-morbidity subgroup. Corresponding

Discussion
In this study, HDHP members with diabetes experienced mini-
malchangesinhigh-priorityoutpatientvisitsanddiseasemoni-
toring measures, but they delayed presenting for first outpa-
tient complication visits and experienced 5.6% to 8.0%
increasesinEDcomplicationmeasures.Low-incomeandhigh-
morbidity HDHP members also experienced delays in present-
ing for outpatient complication visits after the HDHP switch,
and these groups, as well as HSA HDHP members, experi-
enced moderate to large increases in ED acute complication
visits or expenditures.
The results are generally consistent with our hypotheses.
Reductions in specialist visits were smaller than expected, but
the decline in this rate might have been tempered by an in-
creased need for specialist care because of increased severity
of diabetes complications. Although we cannot directly de-
terminewhetherdelayedoutpatientcomplicationvisitscaused
increased morbidity among vulnerable HDHP members, the
large increases in ED complication episode costs that were de-
tectedseemsuggestive.Despitesomeuncertaintyaboutcausal
mechanisms and morbidity impact, increased acute diabetes
complications and associated expenditures are almost cer-
tainly unintended consequences that all stakeholders wish to
avoid. Another potential implication of this study is that ad-
verse HDHP effects in diabetes would have gone undetected
if assessed using traditional Healthcare Effectiveness Data and
Information Set disease monitoring metrics, suggesting that
health systems could benefit from adopting acute prevent-
able diabetes complication measures, such as the one we cre-
ated and validated.
Reasons for the acute complication findings may be
clarified by considering the effects in the key patient sub-
groups. It is likely that high-morbidity, low-income, and
HSA-eligible patients with diabetes (who experienced the
largest cost-sharing increases) had significantly greater con-
cerns about HDHP-related out-of-pocket spending than did
their less vulnerable HDHP counterparts. These patients
might therefore attempt to minimize health expenditures by
forgoing expensive scheduled and acute visits or by shifting
care to less expensive but potentially less appropriate set-
tings. Such effects might lead to more severe disease by the
time of presentation for acute complications. Adverse out-
comes among HSA HDHP members might imply that HSA
funding levels were low, that patients were unaware of this
resource, or that they engaged in inappropriate attempts to
preserve HSA funds. These findings among subgroups sug-
gest that a bifurcation of outpatient care could be occurring
among HDHP members with diabetes, with less vulnerable
patients largely unaffected but more vulnerable patients fac-
ing access limitations that ultimately increase acute care uti-
lization. Future studies could directly assess the causal asso-
ciation between care delays and acute complication visits
and determine whether other factors, such as medication
nonadherence, play any role.
To our knowledge, no previous research has examined
outpatient visits or complications among HDHP patients
with diabetes. The landmark RAND Health Insurance Experi-
ment from 40 years ago predicted that the “poor and sick”
would have increased long-term mortality under high-level
cost sharing due to worsened hypertension control.11 Our
study, which occurs in a different health care era and was
able to enroll a far larger sample of chronically ill patients, is,
to our knowledge, the first to examine acute complication
measures among chronically ill HDHP members. The study
adds the key finding that concerning utilization patterns
increase soon after an HDHP switch among similarly vulner-
able populations. Other chronically ill HDHP patients who
require time-sensitive care, such as those with coronary
heart disease, heart failure, or cancer, might be at risk, but
further research is warranted.
Two previous studies found minimal or no changes in sev-
eral diabetes disease monitoring metrics28,29; similarly, we de-
tected no changes in such measures, likely related to low out-
of-pocket costs (eTable 8 in the Supplement) and perhaps the
perceived nondiscretionary nature of these tests (eg, retinal
eye examinations). These findings should be reassuring to pri-
mary care physicians both because they might presage un-
changed long-term disease control under HDHPs and be-
cause the rates of such tests are increasingly being used to
measure clinician performance. Our disease monitoring re-
sults also confirm a growing body of literature demonstrating
that excluding high-value services, such as secondary preven-
tive tests, from cost-sharing under HDHPs might help to pre-
serve their use.30-33

Limitations
This study has several potential limitations. We did not have
exact benefit coverage details for large employers, but we used
a highly sensitive and specific algorithm for detecting their de-
ductible levels. Furthermore, analyses of actual out-of-
pocket expenditures showed that, at the population level, the
HDHP group experienced increased out-of-pocket medical ex-
pendituresofapproximately50%,indicatingthevalidityofour
plantypeclassification.Themeasureofacutecomplicationvis-
its is novel, but we created the measure rigorously and vali-
dated it extensively, as described above and in the eAppen-
dix in the Supplement. Furthermore, the top 5 diagnosis
clusters (eg, cellulitis, urinary tract infection, hypoglycemia or
hyperglycemiaandtheirmajoracutecomplications,anginaand
ischemicheartdisease,andpneumonia)havefacevalidity,and
analyses of this subset revealed similar patterns (eTable 18 in
the Supplement). Nevertheless, measurement error is still pos-
sible given the lack of consensus regarding which diagnoses
areconsidered“acutepreventablediabetescomplications”and
theimprecisionofInternationalClassificationofDiseases,Ninth
Revision diagnoses. We did not have information about HSA
contributions, which could permit determining whether such
funds modify the adverse outcomes that were detected. We
also did not report changes in laboratory values (because of a
high degree of missing values) or medication use. We did not
have access to health insurance premiums and therefore could
not estimate the total member expenditures (premiums plus
outofpocket).Finally,thisstudyisnotrepresentativeofpeople
with nonemployer-sponsored insurance, very low socioeco-
nomic status, very high deductibles, or those whose first ex-
posure to insurance is under HDHPs.
Conclusions
Thisstudyfoundthatpatientswithdiabetesexperiencedmini-
mal changes in outpatient visits and disease monitoring after
an HDHP switch, but low-income, high-morbidity, and HSA
HDHP subgroups experienced major increases in ED visits or
expenditures for preventable acute diabetes complications.
These subgroups might be especially at risk in the increas-
ingly HDHP-centric private US health system, and our results
support a strategy of minimizing the enrollment of vulner-
able diabetes subpopulations in HDHPs or targeting cost-
sharing reductions, such as HSA contributions, to such
patients.34
