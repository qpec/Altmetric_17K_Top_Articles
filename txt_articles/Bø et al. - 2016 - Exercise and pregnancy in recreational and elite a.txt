ABSTRACT
This is Part 2 of 5 in the series of evidence statements
from the IOC expert committee on exercise and
pregnancy in recreational and elite athletes. Part 1
focused on the effects of training during pregnancy and
on the management of common pregnancy-related
symptoms experienced by athletes. In Part 2, we focus
on maternal and fetal perinatal outcomes.
BACKGROUND
This is Part 2 of 5 in the series of evidence state-
ments from the IOC expert committee on exercise
and pregnancy in recreational and elite athletes.
Part 1 focused on the effects of training during
pregnancy and on the management of common
pregnancy-related symptoms experienced by ath-
letes.1 In Part 2, we focus on maternal and fetal
perinatal outcomes.
Despite the maternal health benefits of exercise,
there is a long-standing concern about the potential
adverse effects of maternal exercise on the develop-
ing
fetus,
labour
and
birth
outcomes.
There
remains apprehension that selective redistribution
of blood flow to the exercising maternal muscles
may result in inadequate fetal oxygenation leading
to ominous fetal heart rate (FHR) changes and pos-
sibly miscarriage. There have been concerns that
exercise-induced changes in uterine blood flow and
an associated reduction in nutrient supply may
impact fetal birth weight, particularly in women
training at elite levels. Finally, there has also been
concern that strenuous exercise increases the tone
of the pelvic floor muscles possibly leading to pro-
longed labour, pelvic floor and perineal trauma and
need
for
instrumental
delivery
and
caesarean
section.2
AIMS
This evidence statement, based on a systematic lit-
erature search, examines how strenuous exercise
affects the fetus. It also addresses issues relating to
birth, such as risk of preterm birth, prolonged
labour and mode of delivery, including injuries to
the pelvic floor muscles and the perineum.
METHODS
For each section of this evidence statement, a search
strategy was performed using search terms, includ-
ing ‘pregnancy’ OR ‘pregnant’ OR ‘postpartum’
AND ‘exercise’ OR ‘physical activity’ OR ‘leisure
activity’ OR ‘leisure’ OR ‘recreation’ OR ‘recre-
ational activity’ or ‘physical fitness’ OR ‘occupa-
tional activity’ AND terms related to the condition
under study (eg, ‘cesarean section’, ‘miscarriage’).
Available databases were searched, with an emphasis
on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, PEDro, W
eb of
Science and SPORTDiscus. In addition, existing
guidelines with reference lists were scanned.
With regard to lifting (strength training), we
draw on leisure-time and occupational studies to
inform the review. However, there is a downside
that occupational studies include select populations.
The review of each topic followed the following
order: prevalence of the condition in the general
pregnant or postpartum population, prevalence in
high-level exercisers or elite athletes, risk factors in
the general population and in relation to exercise
and sport, and effect of preventive and treatment
interventions. The level of evidence and the grade
of recommendations are according to the Cochrane
handbook (table 1) for prevention and treatment
interventions only. Given this paper addresses preg-
nancy, where sex is not specified assume that we
refer to women.
Each member of the working group acted as a
lead author of one or more topics and 1–3 other
members were assigned to review each topic. A first
full
consensus
draft
was
reviewed
before
and
during the 3-day IOC meeting (27–29 September
2015), and a new version of each topic was submit-
ted to the meeting chairs (KB and KMK) shortly
after the meeting. Each topic leader made amend-
ments before sending a new version for comments
to the working group.
THE EFFECT OF EXERCISE ON THE FETUS
In this section, we consider the effects of exercise
on FHR, risk of miscarriage, fetal growth, risk of
preterm birth and Apgar scores at birth.

 bradycardia and that >160 bpm is recognised as fetal tachycar-
dia. FHR variability, with an amplitude of 6–25 bpm from base-
line, is considered to be normal variability and is linked to fetal
well-being. For example, at <32-week gestation, FHR accelera-
tions of 10 bpm for 10 s, and beyond 32 weeks, FHRs that peak
15 bpm or more above baseline, are considered good predictors
of adequate oxygenation and fetal well-being. This variability is
a direct result of fetal maturation and a balance between the
developing sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic nervous
systems. Minimal or absent variability has been linked to fetal
metabolic acidaemia or hypoxia.
During maternal exercise, there is an increase in the secretion
of catecholamines and, as a result, a redistribution of blood
flow, preferentially to the exercising muscles. In non-pregnant
women at rest, ∼20% of the blood flow is directed to the
muscles
and
∼26%
to
the
splanchnic
organs,
including
the uterus. During strenuous exercise, 88% is redirected to the
muscles and <2% to the splanchnic organs.4 While these blood
flow measures differ according to measurement methodology,
and have not been confirmed during pregnancy, it is clear that
blood flow during exercise is preferentially redirected to the
working muscles.
Maternal exercise, regardless of intensity, triggers an increase
in FHR; on average, by 10–15 bpm. This could reflect a protect-
ive mechanism for fetal well-being.3 5–9 FHR accelerations in
excess of 15 bpm, lasting >15 s, reflect adequate fetal oxygen-
ation and an umbilical arterial pH >7.2. In contrast, repetitive
variable or late FHR decelerations usually reflect placental dys-
function, umbilical cord compression fetal distress or other con-
ditions. Rapid onset and offset in FHR reflects vagal responses.
However, in the absence of variability, these changes may indi-
cate fetal hypoxia. Episodes of maternal hypoxaemia first cause
transient FHR accelerations but if hypoxia persists, the fetus
will develop bradycardia.
There are several reports of abnormal FHR recordings during
strenuous exercise. Some of the recordings were interpreted as
artefacts, caused by the ultrasound Doppler transducers record-
ing periodic pacing/movements of the exercising mothers rather
than FHRs.5–7 However, in one report, three cases of bradycar-
dia occurred during exertion at 90% of VO2 max, which per-
sisted at rest.10 In another report, FHR decelerations were
recorded during and immediately post exercise in five cases and
were interpreted as being caused by an exercise intensity that
interfered with umbilical blood flow; some of these events were
associated with elevated umbilical and uterine Doppler.11 Six
Olympic-level athletes who were pregnant at 23-week to
29-week gestation ran 3–5 submaximal workloads on a tread-
mill at 60–90% of VO2 max. Once the women reached 90% or
more of their maximal heart rate, fetal bradycardia occurred,
and there was a high umbilical artery pulsatility index (PI) when
the women exercised. These findings may suggest that high
intensity exercise could compromise fetal well-being.12
Labour and delivery are physiologically challenging events for
the fetus and mother. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate
FHR responses to maternal exercise during labour, after the
fetal membranes were ruptured. The recordings were obtained
by direct fetal monitoring, with electrodes attached to the fetal
scalp.13 T
wo Olympic-level athletes, who exercised strenuously
daily throughout pregnancy, also exercised during their active
phase of labour. During labour, the athletes performed a sub-
maximal VO2 test (at 60% of their known VO2 max) for 4 and
4.5 min. The FHR recorded was normal prior to, during and
after the exercise. Both athletes delivered vaginally and had no
labour complications; the newborns had Apgar scores of 9 and
10 at 1 and 5 min. The newborns were developing normally
when evaluated at 6 weeks of life. The combined effect of
uterine activity during labour and moderate/strenuous exercise
did not alter the uterine/placental perfusion or reserve, to
trigger FHR abnormalities.
In all of these studies, FHR decelerations were transitory, and
the FHR was typically returned to normal when exercise
stopped. Although decelerations have been reported to occur
during and after exercise, brief heart rate decelerations are rare
and sporadic, and are thought to be inconsequential.5–10 No
neonatal abnormalities in relation to these occurrences have
been reported.
Level of evidence: although some of these studies in this area
have been conducted in elite athletes, the studies are mostly case
studies/series and the quality of evidence is therefore rated as
very low.
Risk of miscarriage
Definition
Miscarriage (ie, spontaneous abortion or pregnancy loss) is the
loss of a pregnancy during the first 20 weeks of the pregnancy.
Prevalence
Miscarriage is frequent, >10% in the general pregnant popula-
tion, of which 80% occur in the first trimester (Committee on
Practice Bulletins—Gynecology, 2015).14 The risk of miscarriage
is most dependent on maternal age, with women <35 years
having a risk of 5–7% and women over 40 years having a risk
of 22%.9 The risk is higher with fertility treatment, but the
major cause of miscarriage remains chromosomal abnormalities
of the fetus. Independent of training routine, like all pregnant
women, female athletes may also sustain a miscarriage. The
question is whether a strenuous exercise routine increases the
risk of miscarriage?
Strenuous activity and miscarriage
In a cohort of 92 671 women, of whom 3187 had experienced
a miscarriage, 2551 were interviewed about their exercise
habits.15 Data on exercise were obtained either during preg-
nancy or after an early miscarriage (<gestational week 22). HR
was estimated for gestational week <11, 11–14, 15–18 and 19–
22. The risk of miscarriage increased as the amount of exercise
increased to a HR (ie, instantaneous risk over the study period)
of 3.7 (95% CI 2.9 to 4.7) for women who exercised for
>7 hours/week compared to non-exercisers. High-impact exer-
cise ( jogging, ball games and racquet sports) was associated with
an increased risk of miscarriage of HR 3.7 (95% CI 2.9 to 4.7).
However, there was no association between exercise and the
risk of miscarriage after 18-week gestation. In light of the

 relationship between high-impact leisure-time exercise and early
miscarriage is limited.15
Where there may be an increased risk for miscarriage is when
there is intense exercise at the time of implantation.16 In a pro-
spective study in which women planning first pregnancy were
followed from termination of birth control until pregnancy (for
up to six menstrual cycles), 162 women reported 181 pregnan-
cies.
Using
prospectively
collected
structured
diaries,
the
adjusted risk ratio (RR) for miscarriage was higher in women
who reported higher than average physical strain on days 6–9
after the estimated date of ovulation (RR 2.5, 95% CI 1.3 to
4.6). There was no association with weekly average daily activity
scores, suggesting that it was the intensity of the effort(s)
around the implantation phase that was associated with the risk
of miscarriage. The scant epidemiological data suggest that high-
impact or high strain physical activity may be associated with a
slightly higher risk of miscarriage during the fetal implantation
phase.
Level of evidence: for a negative effect of strenuous exercise
on miscarriage is low to moderate.
Lifting and miscarriage
In a large cohort of 71 500 women with 2886 miscarriages, the
adjusted risk of early miscarriage (before 13 weeks) increased
with increasing frequency of daily lifts and total burden lifted
per day at work.17 The HRs were 1.38 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.74)
for a total weight load per day of 101–200 kg, and 2.02 (95%
CI 1.23 to 3.33) for a daily weight load >1000 kg, both com-
pared
with
non-lifters.
Late
miscarriage
(defined
as
13–
21 weeks) was associated with total daily load, but not with the
number of lifts per day. There was no association between occu-
pational lifting and stillbirth >22 weeks.18 19 Similarly, a retro-
spective study in 1752 women working in the textile industry
found an increased risk of self-reported miscarriage in women
who repeatedly worked in a crouching position (OR 1.82, 95%
CI 1.14 to 2.93),20 compared to women in sedentary jobs.
W
omen whose work provided light or medium physical activity
had a lower risk of miscarriage.
Level of evidence: for a negative effect of lifting on miscar-
riage is low to moderate.
Light-to-moderate physical activity and miscarriage
A systematic review21 concluded that light to moderate intensity
leisure-time physical activity does not increase the risk of mis-
carriage and may perhaps decrease it. There was limited evi-
dence that leisure-time light-to-moderate physical activity and
occupational physical activity (work related or household) may
relate differently to miscarriage, although data are insufficient to
draw robust conclusions.
Overall, it appears that in the general population, regular
light-to-moderate physical activity does not increase the risk of
miscarriage and may decrease the risk of miscarriage.22 There
may be special circumstances related to the performance of
strenuous exercise around the implantation period that may
increase the risk of miscarriage.16
Level of evidence: in the absence of studies in elite athletes,
female athletes who want to become pregnant may consider
limiting the intensity of high-impact training routines in the
week after ovulation, and refraining from repetitive heavy
lifting
efforts
in
the
first
trimester
of
pregnancy.
However, these recommendations are based on low quality
studies.
Fetal growth and the newborn’s birth weight
In non-pregnant athletes, high intensity exercise is associated
with redistribution of blood flow away from the splanchnic
organs towards the skeletal muscles. To meet the needs of the
developing fetus, blood flow to the uterus during pregnancy
increases from 50 ml/min in the first trimester to 500 ml/min in
the third trimester. Therefore, there is a theoretical concern that
regular, strenuous exercise in pregnancy, resulting in temporary
redistribution of a portion of this blood flow, may impair fetal
growth.
This theory has been proved in numerous animal species
using forced exercise.21 However, the impact of maternal exer-
cise on newborn birth weight in humans is less clear. A
Cochrane review of 14 trials (1014 women)23 reported no sig-
nificant change in birth weight with exercise. Moderate intensity
exercise may reduce the risk of large-for-gestational-age and
small-for-gestational-age babies.24 Regular strenuous exercise,
particularly during the last trimester, generally leads to a lower
birth weight (∼200 g) than if not exercising (ref.). This lower
birth weight reflects lower fat mass but a greater lean mass in
newborns of exercisers, compared to non-exercisers.24
There is heterogeneity in the exercise regimens, including type,
frequency and intensity of exercise of pregnant women.25 In con-
trast to sedentary women, those who exercised during pregnancy
had a 31% lower risk of having a newborn >4000 g or >90th
centile for gestational age (95% CI 0.55 to 0.86).25 Although the
offspring of exercising women were, on average, 31 g smaller than
those of inactive women (95% CI −57 to −4 g), there was no dif-
ference in the rate of having a baby <2500 g or less than the 10th
centile for gestational age (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.46).25
Clinical trials examining the effect of exercise on newborn
birth weight have prescribed exercise regimens of at least 2–3,
30 min sessions per week. These regimens may not be strenuous
enough to elicit the effects seen in animal models. There are no
published trials evaluating newborn birth weight in elite ath-
letes. Although the minor decrease in newborn weight is
unlikely to be clinically significant following the exercise regi-
mens used in the populations studied, caution is advised when
extrapolating that minor impact to the elite athlete who exer-
cises at a much higher frequency and intensity. Reducing the
rate of macrosomia reduces the risk of shoulder dystocia, caesar-
ean section, and childhood obesity.26 27
Level of evidence: high level of evidence that exercise during
pregnancy reduces excessive birth weight, but lack of studies in
elite athletes.
Physical activity and preterm birth
Definition
Preterm birth is defined as birth of a live-born infant prior to
the
completion
of
37-week
gestation
(W
orld
Health
Organization, 2012). Preterm birth can be categorised according
to
gestational
age,
aetiological
pathway
and
clinical
presentation.21
Prevalence and impact of preterm birth
An estimated 15 million babies (>10% of babies) are born
preterm each year, and in most countries, the rates are rising.28
This is, in part, due to improvements in antenatal care and care
during labour, which improve survival of preterm infants that
would otherwise not have survived. In addition, >1 million
babies die due to complications from preterm birth, making it
the leading cause of newborn death and the second leading cause

affected by disabilities resulting from their premature delivery.
Physical activity and preterm birth
The literature on physical activity and preterm birth is often
separated by physical activity mode (occupational vs leisure),
since findings tend to differ.
Observational studies—occupational physical activity: There
remains some controversy in the literature regarding the impact
(if any) of occupational physical activity (eg, long periods of
standing, walking or lifting) on the risk of preterm birth. Studies
reporting an effect of physical activity consistently show this
effect to be low (absolute increase in risk of 1–4%).30–34
Observational studies—leisure-time physical activity: In the
general obstetric population, there is no evidence of an associ-
ation between leisure-time physical activity or exercise, and an
increased risk of preterm birth.21 32–50
Most observational studies have not reported strenuous
leisure-time physical activity. For studies that had sufficient stat-
istical power to explore strenuous leisure activity (typically as
any vs none), there was no effect or a modestly reduced risk of
preterm birth.48 50–52
One small study exists describing preterm birth and physical
activity among athletes.53 Among 131 well-conditioned recre-
ational athletes with an uneventful first half of pregnancy, 87
continued to exercise regularly and 44 discontinued exercise
before the second trimester. The incidence of preterm labour
(not preterm birth) was similar in the two groups (9%).
Randomised clinical trials: In 2010, a Cochrane review of 14
trials that compared women who performed aerobic exercise
with those who did not with respect to the risk of preterm birth
(1014 women) concluded that generally the trials were small
and not of high methodological quality.23 Eleven trials reported
on pregnancy outcomes and the pooled estimate was not statis-
tically significant (relative risk (RR) 1.82; 95% CI 0.35 to 9.57).
Since then, at least six randomised trials have been published,
with sample sizes ranging from 3554 to 32055 pregnant women.
In five of these recent studies,55–60 structured aerobic exercise
classes were offered from early in pregnancy (8-week to
14-week gestation) to the end of pregnancy. W
omen in the inter-
vention groups were compared to a usual care control group,
with no differences in preterm birth rates between the groups in
any study. In another study, sedentary women assigned to water
aerobics had a similar risk of preterm birth to sedentary controls
(RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.28 to 2.53).61
Level of evidence: moderate quality evidence, from rando-
mised clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies, to suggest
that there are few effects of exercise on preterm birth rate in the
general population. There have been no studies of elite athletes.
Apgar score
The Apgar score is a tool used by healthcare providers to evalu-
ate the early neonatal adaptation to the extrauterine environ-
ment.57 Apgar scores are commonly assigned at 1 and 5 min
following birth, and evaluate the following neonatal character-
istics: colour, heart rate, reflex irritability, muscle tone and res-
piration.
The
Apgar
score
has
not
been
correlated
with
long-term development outcomes.60 Although, an Apgar score
of 0–3 at 5 min may correlate with an increased risk of
mortality.62
Few studies (although none in elite athletes), with low
numbers of participants, have evaluated the impact of exercise
on Apgar scores. There were conflicting results in two rando-
mised studies of previously sedentary nulliparous women who
received either usual care or a structured exercise programme.
In one study, there was no difference in the mean Apgar scores
at 1 min (7.5±1.3 vs 8.0±0.8, p=0.31) or 5 min (9.4±0.6 vs
9.6±0.4, p=0.08) between the control and exercising groups,63
whereas in the other study the 1- and 5-min Apgar scores were
higher
in
the
exercising
group
(p=0.036
and
0.015,
respectively).64
Level of evidence: there is moderate evidence of no effect of
exercise on Apgar score in the general population and no
studies in elite athletes.
THE EFFECT OF EXERCISE ON DELIVERY
In this section, we consider the effect of exercise on the need
for intervention in delivery.
Induction of labour, episiotomy and epidural anaesthesia
Population rates for induction of labour, episiotomy and epi-
dural anaesthesia vary considerably by geographic location.
Current rates for induction of labour in the USA, UK and
Australia are between 20% and 25%.61 63
Rates of episiotomy, a procedure long considered ‘standard
care’ in the USA and some other countries, have begun to
decrease in many parts of the world. Despite this, variability is
high—between 1995 and 2003, episiotomy rates ranged from
9.7% in Sweden to an estimated 100% in Taiwan.65 In the USA,
rates have changed substantially, from 60.9% of all vaginal
deliveries in 1979, to 24.5% in 2004. A review of vaginal deliv-
eries not complicated by shoulder dystocia, fetal distress and
FHR abnormalities from 510 US hospitals showed a continued
drop in episiotomy rates—17% in 2006 and 12% in 2012.66
Similarly, anal sphincter laceration has decreased from 5% to
3% during the same time period.67
Based on eight randomised trials, a Cochrane review con-
cluded that, compared to routine episiotomy, restrictive episiot-
omy resulted in less severe perineal trauma (RR 0.67, 95% CI
0.49 to 0.91), fewer healing complications (RR 0.69, 95% CI
0.56 to 0.85) and more anterior perineal trauma (RR 1.84,
95% CI 1.61 to 2.10), but no differences in severe vaginal
trauma, painful intercourse, urinary incontinence or pain.68
Results were similar for mediolateral and midline episiotomy.
According to 2008 data, in the USA, 61% of women who
delivered vaginally received an epidural or spinal anaesthetic.69
However, rates in many other developed countries are generally
lower.70
Risk factors for induction, episiotomy and epidural anaesthesia
The increase in induction of labour has been attributed in large
part to elective induction, which is motivated by a variety of
reasons, from scheduling considerations to concerns for compli-
cations.71 Similarly, as highlighted by the summarised trends,
episiotomy is also often elective in some regions, rather than
indicated for fetal distress or other conditions requiring prompt
delivery. The use of epidural anaesthesia depends on availability
of this service, alternate methods of pain control available and
the desires of women and their clinicians.
Induction, episiotomy and epidural anaesthesia and exercise
There are data, including randomised trial data, about the effect
of structured physical activity programmes during pregnancy on
these outcomes in non-athletes. W
e identified no data regarding
these birth events specifically in athletes.
Data from 16 RCTs that evaluated the effect of structured
physical exercise programmes during pregnancy on the course
of labour and delivery were insufficient to draw conclusions

73 Previously, sedentary women assigned to a
light-intensity resistance exercise training during the second and
third trimesters of pregnancy had similar rates of epidural anaes-
thesia to those seen in controls.67 74
In a secondary analysis of a trial in which pregnant women
were randomly assigned to either a 12-week exercise pro-
gramme, conducted between 20-week and 36-week gestation, or
standard care, there were no differences in the proportion of
women who received epidural anaesthesia (36% vs 38%), oxy-
tocin augmentation (51% vs 50%) or episiotomy (31% vs
24%).75
Level of evidence: there is moderate evidence that exercise
does not increase rates of induction, episiotomy or epidural in
the general population. No studies were found in elite athletes.
Prolonged labour
General muscular hypertrophy and increased muscle tone found
in some elite athletes are assumed to predispose the athlete to a
prolonged second stage of labour, during which the mother
works to push.76 The untested assumptions behind this belief
are that these athletes also have hypertrophied pelvic floor
muscles that, in turn, block the ability of the fetus to descend
during pushing. Scant data indicate that elite athletes do have
larger pelvic floor muscles than non-athletes.
The cross-sectional area and width of the pubococcygeus
muscle measured on MRI was greater in a group of 10 athletes
compared with 10 controls.77 Pertinent to successful vaginal
birth, there were no differences between the two groups in the
cross-sectional area of the urogenital hiatus (the opening
through which the fetus passes). In pregnant women studied at
37-week gestation, compared with non-exercisers, those who
exercised 30 or more minutes three times per week had a larger
levator hiatus area at rest and during pelvic floor muscle con-
traction.78 Neither exercising the pelvic floor muscles specific-
ally during pregnancy, nor pelvic muscle strength and endurance
at midpregnancy, increases the risk of operative delivery or
severe perineal lacerations.79 These findings call into question
the hypothesis that exercising regularly causes a ‘tighter’ pelvic
floor that might impede childbirth. Conversely, it is possible that
stronger abdominal muscles found in athletes might allow more
effective pushing and a shorter second stage of labour.
No studies were identified that specifically addressed duration
of labour in elite athletes.
Risk factors for prolonged second stage of labour
Prolonged second stage of labour is generally defined in nul-
liparous women as >3 hours with epidural anaesthesia and
>2 hours without epidural anaesthesia. In multiparous women,
prolonged second stage is defined as >2 hours with epidural
anaesthesia and >1 hour without epidural anaesthesia. In a
recent large US study, a prolonged second stage occurred in
9.9% and 13.9% of nulliparous women with and without epi-
dural anaesthesia, and in 3.1% and 5.9% of multiparous
women with and without epidural anaesthesia, respectively.80
Risk factors for a prolonged second stage include fetal head
position that is not occiput anterior, fetal size, epidural anaes-
thesia and parity.81 82 A systematic review of five studies, includ-
ing 879 patients,83 concluded that data are insufficient to draw
conclusions about the effect of body position during pushing in
women with epidural anaesthesia on the duration of second
stage or on the need for instrumented deliveries.84
Obesity, a clear risk factor for prolonged first stage of labour,
appears to have less impact on the second stage of labour.85
Relationship between physical activity and the duration of labour
W
omen who exercised during their pregnancies had similar
lengths of labour as sedentary women.36 However, these exer-
cise programmes were generally performed for 45 min per day
1–3 times per week and cannot be extrapolated to programmes
of greater intensity.83 A recent systematic review of 16 RCTs
that evaluated the effect of structured physical exercise pro-
grammes during pregnancy on the course of labour and delivery
concluded that data were insufficient to draw conclusions
regarding the effect of exercise on the duration of labour.86 87
Studies published since the previous systematic review may
provide additional insights regarding the effect of physical activ-
ity on the course of labour and delivery. Pregnant women ran-
domly assigned to either an exercise intervention involving a
1-hour physical conditioning programme three times weekly
throughout pregnancy, or control had a shorter first stage of
labour (389 vs 516 min) but no difference in the second stage
of labour.88 Having a higher VO2 during an exercise test per-
formed at 35–37 weeks, a reflection of aerobic fitness was asso-
ciated with a shorter duration of first stage of labour in 40
nulliparous women.36 A secondary analysis of a trial in which
pregnant women were randomly assigned to either a 12-week
exercise programme conducted between 20-week and 36- week
gestation, or standard care, found no difference in the propor-
tion of women with prolonged active second stage (included
active
pushing
only).
However,
the
exercise
group
had,
on average, a longer, albeit clinically insignificant, second stage
(44 compared to 38 min).75
Taken together, these findings suggest that physical activity
during pregnancy either decreases or has no effect on the dur-
ation of labour.79 89
Level of evidence: there is moderate evidence that physical
activity does not increase first or second stage of labour. W
e
identified no data regarding prolonged labour specifically in
elite athletes.
Acute and elective caesarean delivery
T
easing out differences between caesarean delivery rates by level
of exercise is difficult, given the huge variation in caesarean
rates globally. The WHO defined as the ideal caesarean delivery
rate (the rate that balanced harms and benefits of performing or
not performing caesarean) as between 10% and 15%. Countries
with caesarean rates below 10% were considered to show under-
use, whereas countries with caesarean rates above 15% were
considered to show overuse. Fifty-four countries had caesarean
rates below 10%, whereas 69 had rates above 15%. Fourteen
countries had caesarean rates between 10% and 15%.90
The effect of exercise during pregnancy on rates of caesarean
delivery
Primary risk factors for caesarean delivery include nulliparity,
obesity (with a linear relationship between body mass index cat-
egories and risk), cervical dilation at admission to the labour
unit, advanced maternal age and certain medical complications
of pregnancy, such as pre-eclampsia.91
Several RCTs have shown no effect of moderate exercise on
caesarean delivery. In one trial, previously sedentary women
assigned to light-intensity resistance exercise training during the
second and third trimesters of pregnancy had similar rates of
caesarean delivery to controls (15.3% vs 15.7%).92 In another
trial that assessed the effect of a physical conditioning pro-
gramme throughout pregnancy, there was also no difference in
the incidence of caesarean delivery between those assigned to

 this programme and the controls (11.7% vs 14.4% of women
with follow-up).75
Cohort and cross-sectional studies suggest that moderate exer-
cise either protects against caesarean delivery or has no impact
on this outcome.51 53 55 56 75 88 92–94 In a group of well-
conditioned women who regularly performed aerobics or
running before pregnancy, those who continued to exercise at
or above 50% of their preconception level throughout preg-
nancy had a lower incidence of caesarean delivery than those
who discontinued their regular exercise before the end of the
first trimester (6% vs 20%).95 Similarly, pregnant women who
self-selected into a high-level exercise group during pregnancy
had a lower incidence of caesarean delivery (6.7% vs 23.1% in
the low exercise group, and 19.0% in the medium exercise
group).96–98
In a cross-sectional study of 3006 women in the third trimes-
ter, those who reported exercising 150 min or more per week
had no statistically significant reduction in the odds of caesarean
delivery (0.86; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.07) compared with those who
exercised <60 min/week.53 In a cohort study of 1342 women
who delivered at term, compared with women exercising less
than once per week, there were no differences in the caesarean
delivery rates of women who reported exercising 1–4 times per
week (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.15) or 5 or more times per
week during the last 3 months of pregnancy (RR 1.04; 95% CI
0.66 to 1.64) after adjustment for parity, gestational age and
hypertension.93
Based on evidence from systematic reviews:
1. Overall, women in exercise groups had a lower risk of cae-
sarean delivery (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.99).51
2. Low-to-moderate levels of physical activity during pregnancy
among healthy pregnant women modestly increase the
chance of normal delivery.99
Level of evidence: there is inconsistent evidence on the effect
of exercise during pregnancy on caesarean section and no
studies on elite athletes.
Risk of pelvic floor injury
In this section, we outline the evidence for pelvic floor injury
during labour.
The pelvic floor
The pelvic floor provides the support needed to maintain con-
tinence and prevent pelvic organ prolapse. The structures of the
pelvic floor include the bony pelvis, muscular and connective
tissue supports and the endopelvic fascia.78 The muscular sup-
ports include the pelvic diaphragm, made up of the levator ani
muscle (LAM) and coccygeus muscle as well as the urogenital
diaphragm (also known as the perineal membrane), comprised
of smaller perineal muscles. T
erminology representing the LAM
varies, but most nomenclature systems used include the pubo-
coccygeus and ileococcygeus muscles in this muscle group.
Definition of LAM defect
The pubococcygeus muscle is the LAM most affected by vaginal
birth. This muscle stretches more than three times its normal
length during delivery of the fetal head88 and can also be
injured by avulsion from its origin near the symphysis; related
nerves may also be stretched. Avulsion injuries, also known as
LAM tears or LAM defects, can be partial or complete and are
often referred to as minor or major. Multiple definitions of
LAM defect exist and definitions differ depending on the
modality
used
to
detect
them
(generally
ultrasound
and
MRI).100
Reproducibility
varies
widely
and
reliability
is
improved when observers trained by each other are used.101
Incidence of LAM defects
T
en to 20% of primiparous women demonstrate an LAM defect
on MRI or ultrasound.102 W
e found no information about the
incidence of LAM defect in athletes.
Significance of LAM defect
Since
identifying
LAM
defects
requires
special
expertise,
research about these defects and clinical correlates is in its
infancy. In the first year postpartum, LAM defects were asso-
ciated with lower pelvic floor muscle strength, lower pelvic
floor muscle endurance, various types of pelvic organ prolapse,
urinary incontinence and a sense that the vagina was too loose,
but not with fecal incontinence, fecal urgency or a sensation of
a lump in the vagina.103–105
LAM defect is associated with significant pelvic organ pro-
lapse in middle-aged women,104 106–113 but data are inconclu-
sive about whether LAM defect increases the risk for future
stress urinary incontinence remote from delivery.114
Risk factors for LAM defect
This incidence of LAM defect increases to 50% in women
whose deliveries were complicated by specific delivery variables,
including forceps delivery, anal sphincter rupture, large fetal
head circumference, increased fetal weight and prolonged
second stage.113 W
e found no studies on whether physical activ-
ity is associated with LAM defect.
LAM and LAM defects in athletes
Scant data suggest that athletes have larger LAM than non-athletes,
based on MRI or ultrasound measurements.102
109
115–117
However, this may not correlate with increased LAM strength. In
one study of a non-pregnant group, pelvic floor muscle strength,
as assessed by manometer, was lower in a group of 30 athletes
than in 10 non-athletes.77 W
e identified no data regarding LAM
defects specifically in athletes.
Risk of anal sphincter tear
In this section, we outline evidence regarding anal sphincter
injury during labour.
Classification of perineal tears
Anal sphincter tears (also known as third- and fourth-degree
perineal tears) involve injury to the perineum that extend to at
least part of the anal sphincter and may involve the entire exter-
nal sphincter, internal sphincter and anorectal mucosa.118
Incidence of anal sphincter tear
The incidence of anal sphincter tear varies widely, depending on
definition, method of ascertainment, diligence about detection
and population studied, and generally ranges from 3% to
20%.76 119
Risk factors for anal sphincter tear
Midline episiotomy is associated with a 3% risk of anal sphinc-
ter injury. Consequently, a mediolateral approach is more com-
monly used when episiotomy is required.120–122 However, the
angle of episiotomy matters. Suture angles of 40–60° were in a
‘safe zone’ and reduced the risk of anal sphincter injury by 40–
50% compared with spontaneous tears.123 In addition to
midline episiotomy, other risk factors for anal sphincter tear
include first vaginal delivery, shorter perineal length, perineal

 oedema, instrumented deliveries, prolonged second stage of
labour, birth weight >4000 g and fetal occipitoposterior presen-
tation. With the exception of forceps deliveries, which carry a
7% risk of anal sphincter tear, the other risk factors are asso-
ciated with a 2–4% risk.70
Significance of anal sphincter injury
Anal sphincter injury increases the risk of anal incontinence in
the early and later postpartum periods. Six months after delivery,
23% of women with an anal sphincter tear reported bowel
incontinence compared with 13.4% of controls. The incidence
of worse bowel control was nearly 10 times higher in women
with fourth-degree tears than in those with third-degree tears.124
Five to 10 years after childbirth, women who sustained an anal
sphincter tear were 2.3 times (95% CI 1.27 to 4.26) more likely
to report anal incontinence than those who did not sustain a tear
(19% vs 10%).121 124 This increased risk attenuates in older age
as other risk factors for anal incontinence take priority.
Anal sphincter tear in athletes
W
e identified no data on anal sphincter tears specifically in elite ath-
letes. However, in a prospective cohort study
, pregestational physical
inactivity increased the risk of anal sphincter tears (found in 4.3%
of women delivered vaginally) sixfold (OR 6.1, 95% CI 1.6 to 22.9)
after adjusting for other factors. However, these data should be inter-
preted with caution as only 12 of 19 women with an anal sphincter
tear completed information about pregestational physical inactiv-
ity
.120 In contrast, a secondary analysis of data from a randomised
trial in which pregnant women were randomly assigned either to a
12-week low-impact exercise programme that included pelvic floor
muscle training conducted between 20-week and 36-week gestation,
or standard care, found no differences in the proportion of women
who sustained an anal sphincter tear (6% in both groups).125
Prevention of anal sphincter tears
Based on eight randomised or quasi-randomised trials involving
11 651 women, a recent Cochrane review concluded that warm
compresses (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.84 (two studies, 1525
women)) and perineal massage during labour (RR 0.52, 95% CI
0.29 to 0.94 (two studies, 2147 women)) reduced the incidence
of anal sphincter tears.126 Another Cochrane review that
included four randomised or quasi- randomised trials (2497
women) concluded that antenatal digital perineal massage did
not reduce the incidence of anal sphincter tears.79
Level of evidence: there are no studies on the effect of regular
exercise during pregnancy for the prevention of LAM or peri-
neal tears, and no studies in elite athletes.
