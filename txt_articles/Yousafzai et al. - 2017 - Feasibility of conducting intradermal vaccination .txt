Abstract
Background: Administration of intradermal fractional dose of inactivated
poliovirus vaccine (fIPV) has proven to be safe and immunogenic; however, its
intradermal application using needle and syringe is technically difficult and
requires trained personnel.
Methods: We assessed feasibility of conducting an intradermal fIPV campaign in
polio high risk neighborhood of Karachi using Tropis needle-free injector. During
the one-day fIPV campaign, we measured average “application time” to administer
fIPV with Tropis, collected ergonomic information and measured vaccine wastage.
Results: Eleven vaccinator teams, after two-day training, immunized 582 children
between 4 months and 5 years of age. Average “application time” ranged from

1. Background
In the last several years, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) has made
remarkable strides towards successfully eradicating polioviruses globally. As of
April 18, 2017, only 5 cases of poliomyelitis caused by wild poliovirus (WPV)
were reported in 2017 from two endemic countries (Afghanistan and Pakistan)
while no cases have been reported from the third endemic country (Nigeria) [1]. In
order to declare poliovirus eradicated, not only WPV but also polioviruses
emanating from the use of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) need to be eradicated.
This includes OPV (or Sabin) polioviruses as well as vaccine derived polioviruses.
Therefore, the use of OPV has to be replaced with inactivated poliovirus vaccine
(IPV). As a first step in the Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan
2013–2018, Sabin strain of poliovirus type 2 contained in the trivalent OPV
(tOPV) was withdrawn globally in April 2016; and tOPV was replaced by bivalent
OPV (bOPV) containing Sabin strains 1 and 3. In addition, at least one dose of IPV
was supposed to be introduced in all countries for risk mitigation purposes [2],
however, an unanticipated reduction in manufacturing capacities resulted in an
acute shortage of IPV that affected 43 countries and caused either delayed IPV
introduction or stock-outs in countries that had already introduced IPV [3, 4]. This
global IPV shortage is predicted to last for several years and therefore GPEI started
exploring options of how to stretch the existing IPV supply.
Intradermal administration of 1/5th of full dose IPV (0.1 mL instead of 0.5 mL),
referred to as fractional IPV (fIPV) has demonstrated good safety and
immunogenicity [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]; and can be considered as an important
strategy to combat the shortage of IPV by dose sparing in routine immunization or
for outbreak response campaigns [13].
While the use of full dose intramuscular administration of IPV in campaigns was
successfully demonstrated in Africa, Pakistan and Afghanistan [14], the
intradermal use of fIPV in campaign settings was considered to be technically
challenging with traditional BCG needles and syringes (considered as “classical
intradermal administration performed by insertion of a 26–27 gauge needle nearly
parallel to and solely into the skin to raise a visible bleb”). Despite these

 challenges, a successful fIPV campaign with BCG needle and syringe was carried
out in India and in Pakistan in 2016 [15].
In order to overcome the perceived difficulties with use of BCG needle and syringe
in campaign settings, new intradermal administration methods are being explored,
including Tropis needle-free injection system manufactured by Pharmajet®,
(Colorado, USA) (Tropis). This device has been previously tested in polio studies
in Cuba and the Gambia. In these studies Tropis has demonstrated its ability to
induce equal immunogenicity and injection quality when compared with other
intradermal methods; and no safety concerns were identified [7, 16]. So far,
however, Tropis has not been evaluated for program feasibility, and safety in
campaign setting. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and
safety of Tropis for administering fIPV in campaign setting among children aged
4–59 months in polio high risk area of Karachi, Pakistan.
2. Methods
Karachi is the biggest metropolitan city of Pakistan and is divided into 18
administrative towns. The study was conducted in one of the low-income areas,
Ibrahim Hyderi in Bin-Qasim town − a peri-urban neighborhood, with estimated
population of about 150,000. The department of pediatrics and child health of the
Aga Khan University (AKU) operates primary healthcare center (PHC) in this area.
AKU has well-established demographic surveillance, which captures pregnancies
and new births. The PHC provides Expanded Programme of Immunization (EPI)
services in liaison with the local town health officer. Children aged 4 to 59 months,
living in Ibrahim Hyderi for at least 3 months, whose parent or legal guardian
provided informed consent were eligible to be enrolled in this study.
A group of “vaccinators” without any formal training regarding health or injection
administration but with at least secondary school certificates were hired. AKU
provided two-day training regarding the study protocol, consent taking procedure,
IPV, cold chain maintenance, and how to use Tropis. Eleven teams were formed
(each team composed of 2 community mobilisers, 1 vaccinator and 1 assistant).
We conducted a one day campaign on December 29, 2016. As per WHO
recommendations, temporary outreach vaccination centers in health houses,
religious institutions, schools, or offices of the local organizations and houses of
the local leaders were established [14]. Vaccinators and their assistants set up
vaccination stations in the temporary outreach centers in different locations in the
area, while their respective community mobilizers started house-to-house visits to
bring children to the temporary vaccination stations. The assistant in each team
obtained informed consent. If consent was provided, one dose of fIPV was
administered to the selected children using Tropis. The vaccine used was produced
by Bilthoven Biologicals, Netherlands and was presented in one-full-dose vials

 (0.5 mL). The vaccine was administered in the upper arm of the child. The assistant
in each team advised the parents to report to the PHC in case of any adverse effect
such as unusual pain on the injection site, swelling, redness, rash, fever, vomiting,
seizures or any other illness. In addition, the families were visited by AKU workers
one and two weeks after the immunization to assess whether any adverse events
following immunization were present.
We defined “application time” as timer period from charging of the Tropis until the
disposal of the used syringe into a safety box. The “application time” was recorded
by the team assistant after each injection. We counted the number of fIPV doses
drawn from each IPV vial. After the end of the campaign, each vaccinator filled in
a questionnaire evaluating ergonomic features of Tropis.
Approvals from Ethical Review committee of AKU and WHO Geneva were
obtained.
3. Results
The community mobilizers approached 688 households, 63/688 (9.15%) house-
holds refused to consent, 19/688(2.76%) households were locked at the time of
visit, 24/688 (3.49%) households had no eligible child and 582/688(84.6%)
consented to participate in the study. Among the households who consented to
participate, 582 children were vaccinated.
There were differences in the total number of children vaccinated by each team.
The team with lowest number of vaccinated children immunized 30 children; the
highest immunized 75 (Fig. 1).

 The average “application time” was 48 seconds. The average “application time”
decreased with the number of children vaccinated. When taking into account the
first 30 children, the average “application time” was 68 seconds for the first child
and 38 seconds for the 30th child (Fig. 2).
The average number of fIPV doses drawn from one IPV vial was 5.3. A total of
110 vials were used to vaccinate 582 children. There was no vaccine loss rather 32/
582 (5.5%) more children were vaccinated with recommended dose.
All the vaccinators reported that crying among children was less common, filling
the device was easy, device was appropriate size, and giving the injection was easy.
One vaccinator reported that air bubbles were not easy to remove (Table 1).
No adverse events related to the fIPV administration were observed either
immediately after immunization or during the weekly monitoring visits for two
weeks after the campaign.
4. Discussion
This study demonstrated that it is feasible, safe and efficient to use Tropis for the
administration of fIPV in a campaign setting. The average “application time” and
vaccine wastage was superior when compared to other methods of intradermal
administration such as BCG needle and syringe or intradermal needle adaptors
[17].
Training on how to use Tropis was straightforward and could be completed in
several hours. The skills required to use Tropis are easy to understand and do not
need any formal health background or prior training in injection administration.
The decreasing “application time” with the number of vaccinated children further
demonstrated that the experience with the device translates into better efficacy

 indicating fast learning curve. Unlike campaigns with orally administered OPV the
main hindrance for IPV campaigns is the unavailability of large number of health
workforce trained in administration, therefore our finding may have important
implications for polio program.
There was 0% vaccine loss reported, possibly due to the fact that the IPV
manufacturer slightly overfilled the vials with IPV resulting in >5 fIPV doses
drawn from 1 vial; and also because the mechanism of Tropis limits the amount of
vaccine drawn into the device-syringe at 0.1 mL.
There were some technical difficulties that occurred with several Tropis devices.
There were 2 devices with failure in the ejection button (the mechanism to eject the
used disposable syringe after injection administration), and 5 devices with either
failure of the charging button (the mechanism to charge the device for
administration of vaccine using the pressure) alone or both charging and ejection
buttons. After this study, the manufacturer of Tropis addressed the identified
issues.
Our study provided evidence that fIPV can be successfully used in a campaign
using Tropis. The device is safe, efficient in dose sparing, quick in administration
of fIPV, and needs minimal training to use in campaign settings.
