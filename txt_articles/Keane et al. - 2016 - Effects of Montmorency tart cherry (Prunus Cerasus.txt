ABSTRACT
Background: Tart cherries contain numerous polyphenolic com-
pounds that could potentially improve endothelial function and re-
duce cardiovascular disease risk.
Objective: We sought to examine the acute effects of Montmorency
tart cherry (MC) juice on vascular function in subjects with early
hypertension.
Design: A placebo-controlled, blinded, crossover, randomized Latin
square design study with a washout period of $14 d was conducted.
Fifteen men with early hypertension [systolic blood pressure (SBP)
$130 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure $80 mm Hg, or both] re-
ceived either a 60-mL dose of MC concentrate or placebo. Micro-
vascular reactivity (laser Doppler imaging with iontophoresis),
arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity and analysis), blood pressure,
and phenolic acid absorption were assessed at baseline and at 1, 2,
3, 5, and 8 h postconsumption.
Results: MC consumption significantly lowered SBP (P , 0.05)
over a period of 3 h, with peak reductions of mean 6 SEM 7 6 3
mm Hg 2 h after MC consumption relative to the placebo. Improve-
ments in cardiovascular disease risk factors were closely linked to
increases in circulating protocatechuic and vanillic acid at 1–2 h.
Conclusions: MC intake acutely reduces SBP in men with early
hypertension. These benefits may be mechanistically linked to the
actions of circulating phenolic acids. This study provides information
on a new application of MCs in health maintenance, particularly in
positively modulating SBP. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov
as NCT02234648.

INTRODUCTION
Cardiovascular disease (CVD)4 is the primary cause of global
mortality (1). In the United States, 1 in 4 deaths can be attributed to
a cardiovascular-related event, equating to w610,000 people/y (2).
In Europe, CVD is a major cause of death in adults and is re-
sponsible for 48% of all annual deaths (2, 3). Epidemiologic
studies have suggested that polyphenol-rich foods can exert posi-
tive cardiovascular health benefits (4–6) on blood pressure (BP) (7),
insulin resistance (8), cholesterol concentrations (9), and platelet
activity (10), which are thought to be attributable to the high phy-
tochemical content in fruits and vegetables (11). Several studies have
investigated these cardiovascular health benefits of polyphenolic-rich
foods; for example, George et al. (12–14) examined the acute and
chronic effects of a fruit and vegetable puree-based drink on vascular
function and other CVD risk factors and showed that endothelium-
dependent vasodilation was greatest at 3 h after consumption. In
addition, Dohadwala et al. (15) demonstrated improvements in
arterial stiffness and brachial artery flow-mediated dilation at 4 h
after cranberry juice consumption.
Montmorency tart cherries (MCs) (Prunus cerasus L.) and their
derivatives are high in numerous phytochemicals (16–20), in-
cluding the flavonoids isorhamnetin, kaempferol, quercetin, cat-
echin, epicatechin, procyanidins, and anthocyanins (21, 22). It has
previously been shown that MCs attenuate inflammation (16) and
oxidative stress (23, 24) and accelerate exercise recovery (23–25).
Furthermore, cherry extracts have been shown in cell and animal
models to exert a range of cardioprotective effects, including
increasing nitric oxide (NO) production and antioxidant status,
reducing lipid oxidation, and inhibiting inflammatory pathways
(16, 17). However, data from human trials are not clear. It was
recently postulated that the health-related benefits associated with
MC consumption might at least partly result from the downstream
metabolites of the principal anthocyanins present in the fruit (20).
Specifically, this work demonstrated an increase in plasma phe-
nolic acids [vanillic acid (VA) and protocatechuic acid (PCA)]

 after MC consumption in humans. These specific phenolic acids
are known to improve vascular function (26, 27) and have been
shown to modulate vascular smooth muscle cell behavior in vitro
(20); however, it is unclear whether MC consumption influences
in vivo cardiovascular function. In a previous study that investi-
gated this premise, Lynn et al. (28) examined the effect of a tart
cherry juice supplement on arterial stiffness and inflammation
in healthy adults and showed no positive response. The authors
speculated that this was because of numerous limitations, including
their sample size and blood sampling technique.
Although the potential for dietary polyphenols to improve
cardiovascular health is encouraging, there is a clear need for
randomized placebo-controlled trials with appropriate experi-
mental controls to ascertain the role that polyphenols from whole
foods and their analogs might exert in health maintenance. Be-
cause MCs are high in numerous phytochemicals (such as an-
thocyanins) that increase the bioavailability of phenolic acids in
vivo, one would expect that they would positively modulate
vascular function. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine
the acute effects of MC consumption on arterial stiffness, BP, and
microvascular vasodilation in men with early hypertension.
METHODS
Participants
Sixteen nonsmoking men with early hypertension [systolic
blood pressure (SBP) $130 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure
(DBP) $80 mm Hg, or both) volunteered to participate for this
trial (NCT02234648). Baseline characteristics are presented in
Table 1. The criterion for inclusion was a resting SBP $130 mm
Hg. A total of 56 participants were screened before the study
commenced. An SBP .120 mm Hg indicates early hyper-
tension, reflects increased systemic vascular resistance, and
is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease
and stroke (29). Resting BP was measured with the use of an
Omron 70CP automated sphygmomanometer according to British
Hypertension Society guidelines after a 10-min rest. Exclusion
criteria were food allergies (as discussed with the research
team); history of gastrointestinal, renal, or CVD; BP-lowering or
anticoagulant medication; current use of any food supplements;
and other risk factors that made participants eligible for treating
BP according to British Hypertension Society guidelines. All
participants were otherwise in apparent good health as assessed
by a health screening questionnaire. The study was conducted
in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and ratified by the
Northumbria University Research Ethics Committee before par-
ticipants provided written informed consent.
Study design
We used a randomized but counterbalanced placebo-controlled,
blinded, crossover Latin square design with 2 experimental arms
and a washout period of $14 d; participants were randomly
assigned to receive either an MC concentrate followed by placebo
or placebo followed by MC concentrate. A washout of $14 d was
chosen based on a previously published study that suggested that
these phenolic compounds are quickly absorbed and/or excreted
(20). Each visit was at the same time of day and was preceded by
an overnight fast ($10 h). Participants reported to the laboratory
at 0800 and provided a baseline venous blood sample. This was
followed by baseline microvascular vasodilation assessment by
laser Doppler imaging (LDI) with iontophoresis; arterial stiffness
assessment by pulse wave analysis (PWA) and pulse wave ve-
locity (PWV); digital volume pulse (DVP) and BP, all with the
participant in the supine position. Participants then consumed the
intervention beverage, and subsequent blood samples, LDI, PWV,
PWA, DVP, and heart rate (HR) measures were taken 1, 2, 3, 5,
and 8 h postconsumption. BP was assessed every hour. No food
or fluid was provided during the study period except for low-
nitrate mineral water. The total amount of water consumed on
the first study day ad libitum was noted, and participants con-
sumed the same quantity on the subsequent visit.
Treatments and dietary control
The MC concentrate (CherryActive) was stored at 48C before
use. Participants consumed either 60 mL MC concentrate (which
according to the manufacturer is estimated to be equivalent
to w180 whole cherries) or fruit-flavored cordial in a blinded
crossover manner. The decision to use 60 mL was based on
previous studies that showed a greater uptake of anthocyanin
and phenolic acids in vivo after consumption (19, 20). The
concentrate was diluted with 100 mL water before consumption.
The placebo supplement consisted of a commercially available
low-fruit (,1%) cordial (Kia Ora; Coca Cola Enterprises)
mixed with water, whey protein isolate (Arla Foods Ltd.), and
maltodextrin (MyProtein Ltd.) to match the MC concentrate for
volume and macronutrient content (energy = 204 kcal; volume =
60 mL; carbohydrates = 49 g; protein = 2.2 g; and fat = 0 g).
Before the study commenced, we explained to participants that
its aim was to investigate the effect of a fruit juice on vascular
function; therefore, they were unaware which beverage was the
experimental drink. Participants were instructed to follow a low
phenolic diet for 48 h before each arm of the trial by avoiding
fruits, vegetables, tea, coffee, alcohol, chocolate, cereals, whole-
meal bread, grains, and spices and were asked to refrain from
strenuous exercise. Compliance with the dietary restrictions was
assessed with a self-reported standardized 2-d dietary record.
Blood sampling
Fasting whole-blood samples were collected at baseline (be-
fore supplementation) and at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 h in a 10-mL EDTA
vacutainer system (Becton Dickinson) that was inverted to mix
the anticoagulant and immediately centrifuged at 3000 3 g for
10 min at 48C. Plasma was aspirated into aliquots and then
immediately stored at 2808C for later analysis.

 LDI
Subjects were placed supine in a quiet temperature-controlled
room in which the ambient temperature was 23 6 18C for all
measures. Two perspex chambers (ION6; Moor Instruments) with
an internal platinum wire electrode were placed on the volar aspect
of the forearm and attached to the skin with the use of adhesive discs
(MIC-1AD; Moor Instruments) and connected to the iontophoresis
controller (MIC2; Moor Instruments). Acetylcholine chloride (2.5
mL, 1%; Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.5% NaCl solution was placed in the
anodal chamber, and 2.5 mL 1% sodium nitroprusside (SNP)
(Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.5% NaCl solution was placed in the cathodal
chamber. Circular glass coverslips were placed over each chamber to
prevent the loss of solutions. Current delivery was controlled by LDI
Windows software version 5.1 (Moor Instruments). Skin perfusion
was measured with the use of a moorLDI2-IR laser Doppler imager
(Moor Instruments). The scanner head was positioned 30 cm above
the chambers. The laser beam was directed by a moving mirror in
a raster fashion over both chambers. A total of 20 repeat scans were
taken—the first set with no current to act as a control and then 4
scans at 5, 4 at 10, 4 at 15, and 2 at 20 mA
˚ . The final 5 scans were
measured with no current. The flux compared with time AUC over
the 20 scans was calculated as a measure of microvascular response
to acetylcholine (endothelium-dependent vasodilation) and SNP
(endothelium-independent vasodilation).
PWV and PWA
PWV and PW
A were determined with the use of arterial tonome-
try (SphygmoCor CPV system; ScanMed Medical). There is strong
association of PWVand PWAwith incident CVD that is independent
of traditional risk factors (30–32). The aortic pulse waveform and
augmentation index (AIx) were derived at the radial artery; PWV
was determined between carotid and femoral sites. A pencil-type
probe was used for all measurements and was held at the base of
the neck over the carotid artery and at the inguinal crease over the
right femoral artery. Recordings were taken when a reproducible
signal was obtained with a high-amplitude excursion. The distance
between carotid and femoral sites was measured, and electrocardio-
gram gating permitted the time lapse between pulse waves at the
carotid and femoral sites to be calculated. The inter- and intratrial
CVs for this method were 3.3% and 3.1%, respectively.
DVP
A PulseTrace PCA 2 (MicroMedical) with a photoplethysmograph
transducer transmitting infrared light at a wavelength of 940 nm
was placed on the index finger of the right hand and used to
calculate the DVP stiffness index (SI) and DVP reflection index
(RI). The DVP records the systolic and diastolic waveforms of the
pulse by measuring infrared light transmission through the finger.
The DVP-SI (m/s) is defined as the height of the subject divided by
the time between the first and second wave peaks and is usually
correlated with the stiffness of large arteries. The DVP-RI is the
relative height of the second peak compared with the first and is
associated with smaller artery stiffness. Collectively, these variables
provide an indication of the arterial stiffness for an individual.
BP
BP was measured with the use of a noninvasive digital automatic
BP monitor (M10-IT; Omron Healthcare). The BP cuff was fitted
by the same researcher at each of the 9 time points. The inter- and
intratrial CVs for this method were 4.6% and 2.1%, respectively.
All vascular measurements took place on the noncannulated arm.
Juice analysis
Total anthocyanins
The monomeric anthocyanin pigment content of the MC
concentrate and the placebo was determined with the use of the pH
differential method (32). The MC concentrate was diluted 1:20 in
25 M potassium chloride buffer at pH 1.0 and 0.4 M sodium acetate
buffer at pH 4.5, respectively. The absorbance was measured with
an Ultraspec UV-visible spectrophotometer (Pharmacia Biotech) at
510 and 700 nm. The absorbance difference A was calculated as
A = (A510–A700) pH 1.0 2 (A510–A700) pH 4.5. The total antho-
cyanin concentration C (mg/L) was expressed as mg cyanidin-
3-glucoside equivalents according to the following equation:
C = A 3 MW 3 DF 3 1000/(e 3 l), where MW is the molar mass
for cyanidin-3-glucoside (449.2 g/mol); DF is the dilution factor;
1000 is the conversion from grams to milligrams; e is the molar
extinction coefficient for cyanidin-3-glucoside (26,900 L/mol);
and l is the path length (1 cm). The inter- and intra-assay CVs for
this method were ,5%.
Total phenolic content
Total phenolic content was measured with the use of a modified
Folin-Ciocalteu colorimetric method (33). Samples were diluted
in deionized water (1:10 or 1:100), and 50 mL diluted extract,
50 mL Folin-Ciocaltea reagent diluted in water (1:25), and
100 mL 6% (wt:vol) sodium carbonate were added into corre-
sponding sample wells of a 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-One).
Absorbance readings were taken at 725 nm at 5-min intervals
over a 30-min period at 258C (Synergy HT multimode micro-
plate reader; BioTek). A stock solution of 5.8 mmol gallic acid/L
was prepared in 80% (vol:vol) aqueous methanol, and quantification
was performed on the basis of a standard curve in the 0–50-mg/mL
range (R2 = 0.99). The analyzed samples were measured instead
of a blank sample. All values are expressed as means of gallic
acid equivalents/g of sample 6 SE for 6 replications. The inter-
and intra-assay CVs for this method were ,4%.
Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity
A modified 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay used
for antioxidant activity measurements was adjusted from Brand-
Williams et al. (34) for use in this study. The DPPH solution was
prepared freshly before analysis by dissolving the DPPH reagent
(2.4 mg) in 80% methanol (100 mL), and then 10 mL extract,
40 mL deionized water, and 200 mL DPPH solution were added
into each well of the 96-well plate. Absorbance readings were
taken at 515 nm at 3-min intervals over a 30-min period at 378C
with a multimode microplate reader (Synergy HT; BioTek). A
calibration curve with the use of 0–500 mM Trolox (R2 = 0.99)
was plotted. Final values are expressed as means of Trolox
equivalents/mg of sample 6 SE for 6 replications. The inter- and
intra-assay CVs for this method were ,3%. The total anthocya-
nin, total phenolic, and total antioxidant capacities for the MC
concentrate and placebo are presented in Table 2.

 Plasma analysis: HPLC
Under the selected chromatographic conditions, calibration
graphs were obtained by preparing standard samples of each
compound in triplicate, with increasing concentrations of each
analyte. The limit of detection and linearity were calculated
from calibration graphs (Table 3). The HPLC diode-array de-
tector was used to identify plasma concentrations of phenolics
for the acute phase of the study (presupplementation to 8 h
postsupplementation). A method previously described by Bell
et al. (19) was adapted for extracting phenolic compounds from
the plasma. Plasma (1 mL) and 0.5 mL propyl gallate (internal
standard, 50 mg; 100 mL/mL) was mixed with 4 mL oxalic acid
(10 nM) and 0.1 mL HCl (12.6 M) in 15-mL falcon tubes and
centrifuged at 3000 3 g for 15 min at 48C. The supernatant was
absorbed onto a Waters Sep-Pak c17 primed (washed with 5 mL
methanol with 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid followed by 2 3 5 mL
water) solid-phase extraction cartridge (360 mg sorbent/cartridge,
55–105 mm). The sample was eluted with 3 mL MeOH + 0.2%
trifluoroacetic acid and dried under N2 at 458C. Samples were
then reconstituted in 400 mL 0.1% formic acid in water:2% HCl
in methanol and filtered through a 0.2-mm polytetrafluoroethylene
filter before HPLC analysis.
An HPLC fluorescence method for detecting and quantifying
selected phenolic compounds in the plasma samples and juice was
carried out with the use of a Dionex UltiMate 3000 HPLC system
equipped with an UltiMate 3000 rapid separation (RS) pump, an
UltiMate 3000 autosampler, and a 3000 RS fluorescence detector.
The filtered samples (20 mL) were injected on a Phenomenex
Luna C18(2) (250 3 2.0 mm; 5-mm particle size) reverse-phase
column thermostat controlled at 308C. The mobile phase con-
sisted of water with 1% acetic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile
with 1% acetic acid (solvent B). After a 5-min equilibration with
20% solvent A, the elution program was as follows: 0–15 min,
20–100% solvent B (0.2 mL/min) followed by a 100% solvent B,
15–18-min (1.0 mL/min) washing stage and return to the initial
conditions within 2 min. Detection was performed at the fol-
lowing excitation/emission wavelengths: lex = 278 nm and lem =
360 nm for PCA and propyl gallate, and lex = 260 nm and lem =
422 nm for chlorogenic acid (CHL) and VA, respectively. The
identification and quantitation of PCA, CHL, and VA content of
plasma samples was based on a combination of retention time and
spectral matching of reference standards (Table 3). Samples were
analyzed on a batch basis; each batch included standards prepared
in 0.1% formic acid in water:2% HCl in methanol, blank control
plasma samples, and fortified plasma samples at 1 (low), 10
(mid), and 25 (high) mg/mL. The recovery ranges were 88.73–
94.98%, 87.31–103.78%, and 89.16–105.98% for low-, mid-, and
high-fortified concentrations, respectively. The final results were
collected for recovery at the low fortification concentration.
Calibration curves were prepared for all antioxidant compounds,
and final results are expressed as mg/mL.
Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis
A liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method
that used the same chromatographic conditions as the HPLC
diode-array detector analyses was used to confirm individual
compounds in the plasma and juice samples. Briefly, LC-MS
analyses were carried out on a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RS HPLC
system equipped with an UltiMate 3000 RS pump, an UltiMate
3000 RS autosampler, and a QExactive Quadrupole-Orbitrap
mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Electrospray
ionization at both negative and positive ion modes was performed
with a spray voltage of 2.00 kV and capillary temperature of
2808C. The total ion current with a range of 100–1500 m/z and
70,000 resolution was measured. Sample aliquots (2 mL) were
injected on a Phenomenex Luna C18(2) (250 3 2.0 mm; 5-mm
particle size) reverse-phase column thermostatically regulated at
408C. The mobile phase consisted of water with 1% acetic acid
(solvent A) and acetonitrile with 1% acetic acid (solvent B). The
same method as applied for the HPLC analysis was carried out
on the LC-MS. The identification of phenolics in the MC con-
centrate was verified by retention time and spectral data com-
parison with the corresponding reference compounds.
Plasma total nitrate/nitrite measurements
Plasma nitrate/nitrite (NOx) measurements were carried out
on plasma samples with the use of an R&D Systems Europe NO
quantification kit. All reagents, standard dilutions, and samples
were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Plasma total NOx determination was used as a surrogate marker
of systemic NO production. The inter- and intra-assay CVs for
this method were ,5%. It should be noted that this measure-
ment is not a reliable index of NO bioactivity in vivo but may be
used as an indicator of NO production.
Sample size calculation
Power calculations were performed for the primary outcome:
SBP. At 80% power and 5% significance, the minimum number
of participants required to allow detection of a difference of
5 mm Hg (clinically relevant outcome) between the responses
to the 2 intervention drinks was estimated to be 12. A total of
16 participants were recruited to allow for dropout.

 Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with the use of PASW
Statistics version 21.0 for Windows (IBM). All group charac-
teristics were reported as means 6 SEs unless otherwise stated.
All dependent variables were analyzed with the use of a within
subject, crossover design; treatment, 2 (cherry juice compared
with placebo) by time, 6 (presupplement, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 h
postsupplement) mixed-model ANOVA. Maulchy’s sphericity
test was used to check the homogeneity of variance for all
ANOVA analyses; when necessary, violations of the assumption
were corrected with the use of the Greenhouse-Geisser adjust-
ment. Significant main effects were followed up with the use of
least significant difference post hoc analysis. As a secondary
analysis, the AUC was calculated by the trapezium rule, which
was subtracted from the fasting value to derive the incremental
AUC. Maximum plasma concentrations (cmax) and times to ach-
ieve maximum plasma concentrations (tmax) were obtained di-
rectly from the plasma concentration-time profiles. A correlation
analysis was performed by with the use of Pearson’s correlation
coefficient to examine the relations between indexes of vascular
function and appearance of phenolic metabolites in plasma. The a
level for statistical significance was set at P # 0.05 a priori.
RESULTS
Sixteen hypertensive men volunteered to take part in the study,
but 1 participant voluntarily withdrew after the first study day.
There were no adverse events reported in response to the in-
tervention products. All participants (n = 15) complied with
the low-polyphenolic experimental diet according to the food
diaries. The washout period of $14 d appeared to be sufficient
given that the active compounds of interest were similar at
baseline for both visits.
Microvascular vasodilation by LDI with iontophoresis
There was no time, treatment, or treatment 3 time interaction
effect observed for acetylcholine (endothelium-dependent vasodi-
lation) or SNP (endothelium-independent vasodilation). Absolute
values are presented in Table 4. The incremental AUC (1–8 h after
ingestion) for microvascular vasodilation was not significantly dif-
ferent between groups (P . 0.05). Values are presented in Table 4.
BP
SBP exhibited a significant time (P = 0.001) and treatment 3
time interaction effect (P = 0.003) with the MC concentrate trial.
A post hoc lease significance difference test indicated that this
difference occurred at 1, 2, and 3 h after supplementation in the
MC group, with peak reductions of 7 6 3 mm Hg at 2 h after
MC consumption relative to the placebo. Individual responses to
60 mL MC consumption and placebo at the relevant time points
are illustrated in Figure 1A and B. Absolute values are pre-
sented in Table 5. DBP showed a significant time effect (P =
0.01) but no treatment or treatment 3 time interaction effects.
Mean arterial pressure demonstrated a significant time (P =
0.001) and treatment 3 time interaction effect (P = 0.01). No
other vascular variables (HR, DVP-SI, DVP-RI, PWV, AIx, and
AIx corrected for HR at 75 beats/min) were altered after con-
sumption of the MC concentrate compared with the placebo
treatment. The absolute values for all variables are presented in

Because of a sampling error, blood was analyzed in 13 par-
ticipants. There was no time, treatment, or time 3 treatment
interaction effect for plasma nitrate or nitrite (P . 0.05).
PCA, VA, and CHL
Plasma PCA (Figure 2A) revealed a time (P , 0.001),
treatment (P , 0.001), and treatment 3 time interaction effect
(P , 0.001). PCA in plasma was higher after MC consumption
across all time points relative to the placebo (P , 0.001). For
the 60-mL MC dose, the tmax was 1 h after consumption,
yielding a cmax value of 2.35 6 0.08 mg/mL. AUC0–8 h values
for PCA were different between the 60-mL dose and the pla-
cebo (93.7 6 2.3 mg $ h $ mL21 and 4.2 6 0.3 mg $ h $ mL21,
respectively; P = 0.005). The presence of PCA was confirmed
in plasma by comparing the experimentally determined mon-
oisotopic molecular weights to the literature values, all of
which were within 61.5 parts per million.
Plasma VA (Figure 2B) revealed a significant time (P =
0.001), treatment (P = 0.001), and treatment 3 time interaction
effect (P = 0.001). VA was markedly higher in plasma for #5 h
after MC consumption than after the placebo trial. Similar to
PCA, the tmax for VA was 1 h after consumption, yielding a cmax
value of 0.20 6 0.01 mg/mL. AUC0–8 h values for VA were
statistically significant between the 60-mL dose and the placebo
(39.6 6 2.5 mg $ h $ mL21 and 0.5 6 0.1 mg $ h $ mL21, re-
spectively; P = 0.026). The presence of VA was confirmed in
plasma by comparing the experimentally determined monoisotopic
molecular weights to literature values, all of which were within
61.5 parts per million. The CHL concentrations in plasma after
consumption were below the limits of detection in this study.
Peak plasma PCA (1 h) negatively correlated with SBP at 1 and
2 h after MC consumption (r = 20.182 and 20.131, respec-
tively). Peak VA in the plasma (1 h) negatively correlated with
SBP at 2 h after MC consumption (r = 20.095). However, these
correlations were not statistically significant. There were no
negative correlations, significant or otherwise, observed in the
placebo trial.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the acute
effects of MC consumption on arterial stiffness, BP, and mi-
crovascular vasodilation in men with early hypertension. In
support of our hypothesis, this study presents new information
that consuming 60 mL MC reduced SBP #3 h postprandially.
This improvement in BP occurred at the same time points as
peak increases in plasma phenolic acid uptake.
BP is a modifiable but nonetheless major risk factor for CVD
(35), and diet is believed to play an important contributing factor
in the advent of hypertension. Relatively small reductions (2–5
mm Hg) in BP have been reported to have an important impact
on cardiovascular mortality (36). To our knowledge, this is the
first study to report a positive modulation of SBP after MC
consumption. Previous studies have demonstrated that other
polyphenol-rich foods such as cocoa, beetroot, and grape extract

 can have a positive effect on BP (8, 37, 38). This study is par-
ticularly noteworthy because data from prospective observa-
tional studies have shown a reduction in mean SBP of 5–6 mm
Hg over a 5-y period was associated with 38% and 23% reduced
risk of stroke and coronary artery disease, respectively (36).
Herein, we reported peak reductions in postprandial SBP of 7 6
3 mm Hg relative to the placebo. Previously, Lynn et al. (28) did
not detect any changes in BP after tart cherry consumption in
normotensive participants (w111/70 mm Hg). This discrepancy
might be attributable to suggestions that the magnitude of
change in the BP response is directly related to baseline BP (39),
making it possible that a higher baseline BP will likely experi-
ence a greater change after an intervention. In addition, Lynn
et al. (28) had little control over the supplement timing in
free-living participants. It is therefore conceivable that any
vasomodulatory effects from the cherries were missed. This is
especially evident given that measures of vascular function were
assessed after an overnight fast; this work clearly demonstrates
that any positive effects are transient and return to baseline after
4 h. The magnitude of BP-lowering effects observed in this
study is comparable to those achieved by a single antihyper-
tensive drug in mildly hypertensive patients (40) and highlights
the potential importance of MCs as an adjuvant in the manage-
ment of hypertension. In this study, the greatest improvements
in SBP occurred in association with peak plasma PCA and VA,
indicating that both of these metabolites could be partly re-
sponsible for the effects observed, particularly given that these
hydroxybenzoic acids have recently been shown to modulate
vascular smooth muscle cell behavior in vitro (20).
To our knowledge, only 1 study has investigated the effect of
a tart cherry juice supplement on arterial stiffness (28). PWV is
emerging as an important measure of vascular function that
relates to CVD risk and has been shown to be a stronger predictor
of arterial stiffness than AIx and central pulse pressure (41). We
did not observe any significant differences in PWV between the
MC concentrate and placebo across the 8-h trial. These findings
are in agreement with Lynn et al. (28), in which no effect was
observed on arterial stiffness in healthy subjects. Notwithstanding

 the aforementioned limitations of that study, there are several
possible explanations for these results that could be applicable to
our findings. Lynn et al. (28) speculated that arterial stiffness is less
responsive to a short-term increase in polyphenols in healthy
populations. Similar to BP, it would appear that the magnitude of
change is directly related to PWV at baseline. In this study, the
mean value at baseline was 5.9 m/s, which, according to the
reference values for arterial stiffness collaboration (42), is well
within the normal ranges for this population.
The pivotal role vascular dysfunction plays in the progression of
atherosclerosis has been increasingly recognized; therefore, the
vasculature has emerged as an important target for dietary ther-
apies (43). We assessed microvascular vasodilation with the use
of LDI, which measured the response to cutaneous perfusion of
the forearm with acetylcholine and SNP (44). Contrary to our
expectations, we did not observe any change in microvascular
vasodilation after the intervention. It was somewhat surprising that
no change was evident given that an increase in endothelium-
dependent microvascular reactivity after high flavonoid (45) and
fruit and vegetable intake (46) has been previously observed.
However, these data are not in isolation; a study by Jin et al.
(47) showed no change in acetylcholine or SNP response after
blackcurrant consumption. However, it is particularly noteworthy
that in this study certain individuals had a far higher endothelium-
dependent vasodilator response than others in the same cohort.
Perhaps similar to what George et al. (14) previously demon-
strated, there is a differential response to the MC concentrate that is
potentially based on genotype. They showed that acute con-
sumption of a flavonoid-rich drink resulted in a considerable in-
crease in dilation of the microcirculation in the forearm in
response to acetylcholine after 180 min in GG individuals
alone. However, there was no effect of the same beverage on
endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the GT genotype or on
endothelium-independent vasodilation in response to SNP in
either genotype. However, this analysis was outside the remit of
this study. These variables might be modulated after chronic
supplementation and are certainly worth future investigation. In
addition, the assessment of endothelial function by LDI is specific
to the region examined and therefore may not provide a fuller
picture of global vascular function.
Peripheral PWA is frequently used to measure the AIx, an index
of arterial stiffness (48). Increased arterial stiffness results in

TART CHERRIES AND VASCULAR FUNCTION

 a faster propagation of the forward pulse wave as well as a more
rapid reflected wave. Therefore, a high AIx has been previously
linked with greater arterial stiffness and has been shown to be
a predictor of adverse cardiovascular events in a variety of patient
populations (49). In this study, there were no noteworthy changes
in AIx or AIx when corrected for an HR of 75 beats/min after acute
ingestion of MC concentrate. Similarly, Hobbs et al. (37) failed to
detect any meaningful changes in AIx after beetroot bread in-
gestion. Although we reported marked improvements in SBP
following the consumption of MC concentrate, there were no
changes in microvascular vasodilation, arterial stiffness, DVP, and
HR; it has previously been reported that concurrent improvements
in all measures of vascular function are not always observed (37).
There are 2 proposed mechanisms by which tart cherries are
thought to improve indexes of cardiovascular function. The first is
via the NO pathway, which increases the bioavailability of NO via
its potential to inhibit NADPH oxidase. Cyanidin-3-glucoside, an
anthocyanin found in abundance in tart cherry products (19, 22),
has also been shown to increase endothelial NO synthase (eNOS)
expression (50) and decrease inducible NO synthase expression
(51). Such changes in the balance between eNOS and inducible
NO synthase expression/abundance/activity would favor the bio-
availability of the vasoactive NO. However, this study measured
plasma total NOx concentration, often used as a surrogate marker
of eNOS activity (52), and found no changes in the plasma NOx.
The second and perhaps more likely idea by which MCs improve
factors associated with CVD is based on the uptake of phyto-
chemicals that possess cardioprotective properties. An analysis of
the MC juice revealed larger amounts of total anthocyanins and
phenolic content than in the placebo (Table 2). To investigate
a cause-and-effect relation between improvements in cardiovascular
function and the intake of cherry polyphenols, we examined plasma
concentrations of anthocyanin metabolite profiles after consump-
tion. In linewith BP, we observed a peak increase in plasma phenolic
metabolites at 1 h after MC consumption. This also supports pre-
vious observations that showed that PCA and VA peaked between 1
and 2 h after MC consumption in healthy men (20). These phenolic
acids have previously been observed in plasma after blueberry,
cranberry, and blackcurrant consumption (53–55) and may be re-
sponsible for driving the beneficial vascular response observed.
Both compounds have been shown to modulate vascular function in
isolation (26, 27) and in concert can influence vascular smooth
muscle cell behavior in vitro (20). Concentrations of these acids
gradually decreased after peaking at 1 h, indicating further chem-
ical or microbial degradation (56), excretion, or tissue uptake (57)
of these compounds.
In conclusion, these data provide the first evidence to our
knowledge that circulating phenolic metabolites derived from
MC juice are at least partly responsible for acute improvements in
SBP in men with early hypertension. This study provides further
evidence that diets containing polyphenolic-rich foods have
the potential to exert positive effects on vascular function. In
particular, tart cherries, which contain a high concentration
of bioactive phytochemicals, can modulate human physiologic
function. This study also provides information on a new appli-
cation of tart cherries in health maintenance, particularly in
positively modulating SBP.
