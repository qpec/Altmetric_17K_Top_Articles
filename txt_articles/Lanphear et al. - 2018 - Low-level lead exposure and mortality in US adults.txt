Low-level lead exposure and mortality in US adults: 
a population-based cohort study 
Bruce P Lanphear, Stephen Rauch, Peggy Auinger, Ryan W Allen, Richard W Hornung
Summary
Background Lead exposure is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease mortality, but the number of deaths in the USA 
attributable to lead exposure is poorly defined. We aimed to quantify the relative contribution of environmental lead 
exposure to all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality, and ischaemic heart disease mortality. 
Methods Our study population comprised a nationally representative sample of adults aged 20 years or older who 
were enrolled in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES-III) between 1988 and 
1994 and followed up to Dec 31, 2011. Participants had completed a medical examination and home interview and had 
results for concentrations of lead in blood, cadmium in urine, and other relevant covariates. Individuals were linked 
with the National Death Index. This study presents extended follow-up of an earlier analysis.
Findings We included 14 289 adults in our study. The geometric mean concentration of lead in blood was 2·71 µg/dL 
(geometric SE 1·31). 3632 (20%) participants had a concentration of lead in blood of at least 5 µg/dL (≥0·24 μmol/L). 
During median follow-up of 19·3 years (IQR 17·6–21·0), 4422 people died, 1801 (38%) from cardiovascular disease and 
988 (22%) from ischaemic heart disease. An increase in the concentration of lead in blood from 1·0 µg/dL to 6·7 µg/dL 
(0·048 μmol/L to 0·324 μmol/L), which represents the tenth to 90th percentiles, was associated with all-cause mortality 
(hazard ratio 1·37, 95% CI 1·17–1·60), cardiovascular disease mortality (1·70, 1·30–2·22), and ischaemic heart disease 
mortality (2·08, 1·52–2·85). The population attributable fraction of the concentration of lead in blood for all-cause 
mortality was 18·0% (95% CI 10·9–26·1), which is equivalent to 412 000 deaths annually. Respective fractions were 
28·7% (15·5–39·5) for cardiovascular disease mortality and 37·4% (23·4–48·6) for ischaemic heart disease mortality, 
which correspond to 256 000 deaths a year from cardiovascular disease and 185 000 deaths a year from ischaemic heart 
disease.
Interpretation Low-level environmental lead exposure is an important, but largely overlooked, risk factor for 
cardiovascular disease mortality in the USA. A comprehensive strategy to prevent deaths from cardiovascular disease 
should include efforts to reduce lead exposure.

Introduction
Deaths from cardiovascular disease have declined strikingly 
in the USA over the past 50 years, but this disease is still the 
leading cause of death.1 In 2013, cardiovascular disease 
accounted for more than 800 000 deaths in the USA 
(about one in every three deaths), with total costs exceeding 
US$300 billion annually.1 Cardiovascular disease mortality 
is usually attributed to tobacco use, hypertension, diabetes, 
and lack of physical activity.2 Environmental lead exposure 
is an established risk factor for hypertension and a possible 
risk factor for cardiovascular disease mortality,3,4 but its 
contribution to deaths in the USA is poorly defined.
Lead is one of many recognised risk factors for 
cardiovascular disease. In experimental studies,3,4 chronic 
exposure to lead caused hypertension and enhanced 
the development of atherosclerosis by inactivating 
nitric oxide, increasing formation of hydrogen peroxide, 
inhibiting endothelial repair, impairing angio 
genesis, 
and promoting thrombosis. In human beings, higher 
concen 
trations of lead in blood have been associated 
with hypertension, electrocardiographic abnormalities, 
peripheral arterial disease, left-ventricular hyper 
trophy, 
and cardiovascular disease mortality.4–13 The concentration 
of lead in blood was associated with cardiovascular 
mortality in most, but not all, prospective cohort studies.6–13 
Previous studies of cardiovascular disease mortality in 
lead-exposed populations have been criticised because 
they did not account for other risk factors associated with 
cardiovascular disease mortality, such as cadmium.4,14 No 
studies have estimated the number of deaths in 
the USA attributable to lead exposure using a nationally 
representative cohort, and it is unclear whether 
concentrations of lead in blood lower than 5 µg/dL 
(<0·24 μmol/L), which is the current action level for adults 
in the USA, are associated with cardiovascular mortality.
The aim of this study was to extend the duration of 
follow-up of a previously published analysis7 and quantify 
the relative contribution of environmental lead exposure 
to all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality 
using data from the Third National Health and Nutrition

Examination Survey (NHANES-III), a prospective, repre-
sen 
tative cohort of the US popu 
l 
ation enrolled from 
1988 to 1994 and followed up to Dec 31, 2011.
Methods
Study population
NHANES-III is a multistage stratified survey designed to 
provide a detailed examination of the health and nutri-
tional status of a nationally representative sample of non-
institutionalised individuals in the USA. Consistent with an 
earlier analysis of this cohort,7 we included individuals who 
were aged 20 years or older at baseline. The protocols 
for NHANES-III were approved by the National Center for 
Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention Institutional Review Board. All participants gave 
informed consent.
Procedures
Baseline data in NHANES-III were gathered between 
1988 and 1994, when individuals participated in a 
household interview and a medical examination, during 
which they provided blood and urine samples. Demo-
graphic information—including sex, age, ethnic origin, 
household income, education, residence, smoking status, 
and social support—was obtained during the household 
interview. Information on body-mass index (BMI), 
physical activity, blood pressure, diet, alcohol consum 
p-
tion, medical history, and prescription drug use was 
obtained during the medical examination.
Amounts of lead in blood, cadmium and creatinine in 
urine, cotinine and cholesterol in serum, and glycated 
haemoglobin (HbA1c) were measured from blood and 
urine samples gathered during the medical examination. 
Laboratory methods for the processing of blood and 
urine samples are described in detail elsewhere.15 
Quantification of lead in whole blood samples, which 
entailed extensive quality control, was done using 
graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry.16 
The detection limit for lead in blood was 1·0 µg/dL 
(0·048 μmol/L). For study participants who had 
concentrations of lead in blood below the level of 
detection, we imputed an amount of 0·7 µg/dL 
(0·034 μmol/L), which is the level of detection divided by 
the square root of 2.17
A full description of mortality linkage methods is 
available from the National Center for Health Statistics 
(NCHS).18 Briefly, NCHS staff linked participants in 
NHANES-III to underlying cause of death in the National 
Death Index with a series of identifiers—eg, social 
security number and date of birth—using probabilistic 
matching criteria. Individuals were followed up to 
Dec 31, 2011; if a match was not made with the National 
Death Index, that person was assumed to be alive as of 
that date. In a validation study using mortality-linked 
data from the first NHANES study (NHANES-I; 1971–75), 
96% of deceased participants and 99% of those still alive 
were classified correctly.19 The underlying cause of death 
was obtained using codes from the International 
Classification of Diseases ninth version (ICD-9; 1988–98) 
or tenth version (ICD-10; 1999–2006). We identified 
deaths 
from 
all 
causes, 
cardiovascular 
disease 
(ICD-9 390–459; ICD-10 I00–I99) and ischaemic heart 
disease (ICD-9 410–414; ICD-10 I20–I25; appendix p 1).
Statistical analysis
We have weighted results (percentiles, means, and point 
estimates) to account for the complex survey design 
of NHANES-III, and these data are representative of 
the US Census civilian non-institutionalised population. 
We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for continuous concen-
trations of lead in blood, using Cox proportional hazards 
models. Every participant’s survival—as defined by the

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed between 1980 and Oct 1, 2017, with terms 
including “mortality”, “blood lead concentration”, 
“cardiovascular mortality”, and “population attributable risk”. 
We also searched citations of all identified studies. We restricted 
our search to English language publications. We included human 
studies. Many studies have linked concentrations of lead in 
blood with hypertension and mortality from cardiovascular 
disease. The number of deaths in the USA attributable to lead 
exposure has not been estimated using a nationally 
representative cohort, and it is unclear if concentrations of lead 
in blood lower than 5 µg/dL (<0·24 μmol/L) are associated with 
all-cause mortality or cardiovascular disease mortality.
Added value of this study
Our study is, to our knowledge, the first to estimate in a 
nationally representative sample the contribution of 
concentrations of lead in blood to the number of deaths from 
all causes and from cardiovascular disease. Although we 
cannot exclude residual confounding, we estimate that about 
400 000 deaths are attributable to lead exposure every 
year in the USA, of which 250 000 are from cardiovascular 
disease. Concentrations of lead in blood lower than 5 µg/dL 
(<0·24 μmol/L) are an important, but largely ignored, risk 
factor for death in the USA, particularly from cardiovascular 
disease.
Implications of all the available evidence
Quantifying the contribution of environmental lead exposure 
to cardiovascular disease mortality is essential to understand 
trends in mortality and develop comprehensive strategies to 
prevent cardiovascular disease.

NHANES-III protocol—was the time between the medical 
examination and the date of death, the participant’s 
90th birthday, or Dec 31, 2011, whichever came first.18
We assessed concentrations of lead in blood both as a 
continuous variable and categorically with tertiles. 
We fitted five-knot restricted cubic splines to visualise the 
shape of the dose-response relation of concentrations of 
lead in blood for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular 
disease mortality, and ischaemic heart disease mortality, 
and to investigate whether the relations should be judged 
linear or log-linear.
We 
weighted 
demographic 
and 
environmental 
variables to approximate distributions in the USA by 
using the provided sample weights to account for 
oversampling of young children, older people, black 
people, and individuals of Mexican-American ethnic 
origin in the NHANES-III survey. We adjusted for 
variables recognised widely as potential confounders for 
cardiovascular disease mortality.2–10 We adjusted all 
primary models for age (continuous and age-squared), 
sex, household income (<US$20 000 or ≥$20 000 per 
year), ethnic origin (white, black, Mexican-American), 
BMI (derived from participants’ height and weight 
measurements and categorised as normal [<25·0 kg/m²], 
overweight [25·0–29·9 kg/m²], or obese [≥30·0 kg/m²]), 
smoking status (self-reported [never, current, and former] 
or amounts of cotinine in serum [≥10 ng/mL]), alcohol 
consumption (four or fewer drinks per month or more 
than four drinks per month), physical activity (categorised 
according to frequency of activity in the previous month 
[none, 1–14 times, or ≥15 times]), and amount of 
cadmium in urine (standardised by amount of creatinine 
in urine and categorised in tertiles). Blood pressure was 
measured 
three 
times 
during 
the 
NHANES-III 
household interview and three times during the medical 
examination. We excluded the first reading and used the 
average of all remaining blood pressure measurements 
to classify every participant’s hypertension status (defined 
as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic blood 
pressure ≥90 mm Hg). The Healthy Eating Index, which 
was derived from food frequency questionnaires and 
scored on a scale from 1 to 100, was categorised in 
tertiles.20 Finally, we included HbA1c and amount of 
cholesterol in serum as continuous measures.
We calculated population attributable fractions for 
continuous concentrations of lead in blood using 
previously described methods21 to estimate the proportional 
reduction in mortality that would occur if recorded 
amounts of lead in blood in the entire US population aged 
20 years and older were reduced to 1·0 µg/dL 
(0·048 µmol/L). Absolute numbers of deaths were based 
on the average annual number of deaths from all causes, 
cardiovascular disease, and ischaemic heart disease from 
1988 to 2011.22,23 The standard method for calculating the 
population attributable fraction is a simple comparison of 
the relative risk in the exposed population weighted by the 
proportion exposed with the relative risk in the unexposed 
population weighted by the proportion unexposed. To 
utilise individual measures of lead in blood and their 
associated HR estimates, we calculated the population 
attributable fraction or population impact factor using the 
integral of the HR estimates weighted by the log-normal 
population distribution of measured concentrations of 
lead in blood over the total range (0·70–56·0 µg/dL 
[0·034–2·70 μmol/L]) for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular 
disease mortality, and ischaemic heart disease mortality, 
as described previously.19 We calculated CIs for population

attributable fractions using a substitution method 
proposed by Daly.24 We evaluated the proportional hazards 
assumption using Schoenfeld residuals;25 none of the 
models violated the assumption. Finally, we accommodated 
the com 
plex survey design of NHANES-III using 
SUDAAN (version 10.0.1) to provide weighted national 
estimates and Taylor linearisation to obtain associated 
variance estimates.26
We also did several secondary analyses. To assess the 
effects of low-level exposure to lead, we restricted our 
analysis to participants who had amounts of lead in blood 
lower than 5 µg/dL (<0·24 μmol/L). We tested for 
confounding of concentrations of lead in blood and 
hypertension for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular 
disease mortality by examining the change in the 
estimates for amounts of lead in blood in models with and 
without hypertension. We also investigated the change in 
estimates for hypertension in models with and without 
concentrations of lead in blood. Next, we assessed whether 
characterising potential confounders—eg, diabetes, HDL, 
hypertension, alcohol intake, household income—
differently than in our primary analyses would alter our 
results appreciably. We also investigated the effect of 
secular trends on HRs for concentrations of lead in blood 
by examining NHANES-III phase 1 (1988–91) and phase 2 
(1991–94) data separately. Finally, we assessed effect 
modification of the relation between concentration of lead 
in blood and key characteristics (eg, sex, age, urban 
residence,27 ethnic origin, smoking status, and diabetes).
Role of the funding source
The funder had no role in study design, data collection, 
data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. 
The corresponding author had full access to all the data 
in the study and had final responsibility for the decision 
to submit for publication.
Results
The sample population included 18 825 adults aged 
20 years or older. Of these, 17 030 (90%) had a medical 
examination and home interview. 1419 (6%) participants 
were missing a result for either concentration of lead in 
blood or cadmium in urine, 1314 (7%) were missing 
other covariates, and eight (0·1%) had insufficient 
identifiers to link with the National Death Index. Thus, 
14 289 (76%) participants were included in this analysis. 
1150 (9%) individuals had concentrations of lead in 
blood below the level of detection and had an amount of 
0·7 µg/dL (0·034 μmol/L) imputed. Characteristics of 
participants who were included in the analysis differed 
from those with missing data for some characteristics, 
such as ethnic origin, alcohol intake, and the prevalence 
of diabetes (appendix p 2).
During median follow-up of 19·3 years (IQR 17·6–21·0), 
4422 participants died; 1801 (38%) were attributable to 
cardiovascular disease and 988 (22%) to ischaemic heart 
disease. Concentrations of lead in blood, which ranged 
from 1·0 µg/dL to 56 µg/dL (0·048 μmol/L to 
2·70 μmol/L), were right-skewed with a geometric mean 
at baseline of 2·71 µg/dL (geometric SE 0·131); 
3632 (20%) participants had amounts of lead in blood of 
5 µg/dL or higher (≥0·24 μmol/L). Participants who had 
the highest concentrations of lead in blood were older, 
less educated, and more likely to be male, to smoke 
cigarettes, to consume larger amounts of alcohol, and to 
have less healthy diets (table 1). Participants who had 
high concentrations of lead in blood were also more 
likely to have elevated amounts of cholesterol in serum 
and higher rates of hypertension and diabetes.
Analysis of restricted cubic splines indicated that 
adjusted HRs were steeper at lower concentrations of 
lead in blood than at higher concentrations (figure 1).

A model was fitted using the log10 of measurements of 
lead in blood in the proportional hazards model and 
adjusted HRs and 95% CIs were calculated for all-cause 
mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality, and ischaemic 
heart disease mortality, as well as for other characteristics 
(figure 2). An increase in the concentration of lead in 
blood from 1·0 µg/dL to 6·7 µg/dL (0·048 μmol/L to 
0·324 μmol/L), which represents the tenth to 90th percen-
tiles, was associated significantly with all-cause mortality 
(HR 1·37, 95% CI 1·17–1·60), cardiovascular disease 
mort 
ality (1·70, 1·30–2·22), and ischaemic heart 
disease mortality (2·08, 1·52–2·85; table 2).
Population attributable fractions were calculated to 
show the proportional reduction in all-cause mortality, 
cardiovascular disease mortality, and ischaemic heart 
disease mortality that would occur if recorded concen-
trations of lead in blood were reduced to 1·0 µg/dL or 
lower (≤0·048 μmol/L). The adjusted popu 
la 
tion 
attributable fraction for all-cause mortality was 18% 
(95% CI 10·9–26·1), equivalent to 412 000 (95% CI 
250 000–598 000) deaths each year (table 2). Adjusted 
population attributable fractions were 28·7% (95% CI 
15·5–39·5) for cardiovascular disease mortality and 37·4% 
(23·4–48·6) for ischaemic heart disease mortality, 
equivalent to 256 000 cardiovascular disease deaths 
and 185 000 ischaemic heart disease deaths annually 
(figure 3). In analyses restricted to participants who had 
concentrations of lead in blood lower than 5 µg/dL 
(<0·24 μmol/L), an increase in lead in blood from 
1·0 µg/dL to 5·0 µg/dL (0·048 μmol/L to 0·242 μmol/L), 
which represents the tenth to 80th percentiles, was 
associated significantly with all-cause mortality (HR 1·38, 
95% CI 1·15–1·66), cardiovascular disease mortality (1·95, 
1·46–2·60), and ischaemic heart disease mortality 
(2·57, 1·56–4·52).
In secondary analyses, no appreciable attenuation or 
confounding of estimates for concentration of lead in 
blood or hypertension was noted when these variables 
were included or excluded consecutively in our primary 
model. The results of our primary analysis did not 
change substantially when we made several adjustments:

characterised diabetes as a categorical instead of a 
continuous measure; adjusted for both HDL and 
cholesterol; adjusted for hypertension status (ie, systolic 
blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure 
≥90 mm Hg and use of anti-hypertension drugs); adjusted 
for household income using the poverty index ratio 
(instead of <$20 000 or ≥$20 000 per year); characterised 
hypertension as a continuous measure of both systolic 
blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure instead of a 
categorical measure; characterised alcohol intake as one 
or no drink per day versus more than one drink per day 
(instead of four or fewer drinks versus more than four 
drinks per month); or excluded participants who had a 
concentration of lead in blood lower than 1·0 µg/dL 
(0·048 µmol/L; appendix pp 3, 4). Median concentrations 
of lead in blood decreased by 22% from NHANES-III 
phase 1 (1988–91) to phase 2 (1991–94). Consistent with 
the steeper increase in relative risk, at lower concentrations 
of lead in blood, the rate of increase in relative risk was 
steeper for participants who were studied during 
NHANES-III phase 2 (1991–94) than phase 1 (1988–91; 
appendix p 4).
Examination of effect modification of the relation 
between concentration of lead in blood and key 
characteristics showed that HRs for participants younger 
than 50 years were significantly larger than were those for 
participants aged 50 years or older, for all-cause mortality 
(HR 2·24, 95% CI 1·50–3·34 vs 1·53, 1·18–1·98; p=0·003 
for interaction), cardiovascular disease mortality (2·93, 
1·60–5·36 vs 2·08, 1·35–3·19; p=0·01), and ischaemic 
heart disease mortality (4·68, 2·42–9·05 vs 2·46, 
1·51–4·01; p=0·02). The HR for cardiovascular disease 
mortality was significantly larger for non-smokers than 
smokers (HR 2·19, 95% CI 1·47–3·26 vs 1·32, 0·86–2·05; 
p=0·03 for interaction).
Discussion
Our findings suggest that, of 2·3 million deaths every 
year in the USA, about 400 000 are attributable to lead 
exposure, an estimate that is about ten times larger than 
the current one.28 The key reason for this difference is 
because the previous estimate assumed cardiovascular 
disease was only evident at concentrations of lead in 
blood as low as 5 μg/dL.28 Our findings show that 
concentrations of lead in blood lower than 5 μg/dL 
(<0·24 μmol/L) are associated with all-cause mortality, 
cardiovascular disease mortality, and ischaemic heart 
disease mortality. In other studies, amounts of lead in 
blood lower than 10 μg/dL (<0·483 μmol/L) were 
associated with cardiovascular disease mortality,7,9,10 but 
our study is the first to test whether the relation with 
cardiovascular disease mortality was evident in a 
population with concentrations of lead in blood below 
5 μg/dL (<0·24 μmol/L). These results suggest that low-
level lead exposure is an important, largely overlooked, 
risk factor for death in the USA, particularly for 
cardiovascular disease deaths.
Our results accord with those of other population-
based studies showing that concentrations of lead in 
either blood or bone are risk factors for all-cause mortality 
and cardiovascular disease mortality.5–13 A significant 
association was noted between increased lead exposure 
and all-cause mortality in six prospective studies,6,7,9,11–13,29 
and a significant association was reported between 
increased lead exposure and cardiovascular mortality in 
five of six prospective studies.6,7,9,11–13 No association 
between concen 
tration of lead in blood and cardiovascular 
disease mortality was noted after adjustment for other 
risk factors in a study29 that only included 19 deaths from 
cardiovascular disease.
In our study, the estimated number of deaths from all 
causes and cardiovascular disease that were attributable 
to concentrations of lead in blood were surprisingly 
large; indeed, they were comparable with the number of 
deaths from current tobacco smoke exposure. The HR

for all-cause mortality from tobacco exposure was larger 
than that for concentration of lead in blood, but only 
20% of the US population smoked tobacco. By contrast, 
90% of participants were exposed to lead; a smaller 
relative risk for a prevalent exposure can result in a larger 
population attributable fraction. 
Concentrations of lead in blood lower than 5 μg/dL 
(<0·24 μmol/L) were associated with an increased risk 
of cardiovascular disease mortality. This result contrasts 
with conclusions of the National Toxicology Report,5 
which noted that evidence was limited for an association 
between amounts of lead in blood less than 10 μg/dL 
and increased cardiovascular-related mortality. We also 
reported that risk coefficients for cardiovascular disease 
in the subset of participants with concentrations of lead 
in blood lower than 5 μg/dL (<0·24 μmol/L) were 
generally larger than coefficients in the total sample. 
Although the rate of increase in mortality was greatest 
with low amounts of lead in blood, HRs indicate that 
the risk of cardiovascular disease mortality is rising 
with higher amounts of lead in blood, but at a 
diminished rate. These results, which accord with those 
of an earlier study in this same cohort but of shorter 
duration,7 should not be surprising; despite the striking 
reductions in concentrations of lead in blood over the 
past 50 years, amounts found nowadays in adults are 
still ten times to 100 times higher than people living in 
the preindustrial era (ie, 700–1000 years ago).30 
Moreover, the assumption that there are thresholds for 
specific toxicants—eg, lead, tobacco, and airborne 
particles—is slowly eroding.31
The cardiovascular toxicity of lead stems from various 
mechanisms. In experimental studies, lead causes 
hypertension, results in oxidative stress and inflamma-
tion, diminishes endothelium relaxation, and promotes 
development 
of 
atherosclerosis 
and 
thrombosis.3,4 
In human beings, lead is a recognised risk factor for 
hypertension and has been associated with peripheral 
arterial disease, electrocardiographic abnormalities, and 
left-ventricular hypertrophy.4,10 In a randomised controlled 
trial of patients who had had a myocardial infarction, 
chelation with EDTA and multivitamin therapy led to an 
18% reduction in cardiovascular events; patients with 
diabetes in the trial had a 34% reduction in cardiovascular 
events.32 Collectively, these findings suggest, but do not 
prove, that atherosclerosis and hypertension both could 
serve as underlying mechanisms for the cardiovascular 
toxicity of lead.
Our study has limitations. The key limitation is that we 
relied on baseline measures of exposure to predict death 
over the subsequent two decades. Some measures 
(eg, concentration of lead in blood) might be more stable 
than other risk factors (eg, diet). Lead that is circulating 
in whole blood of adults is an indicator of both past and 
ongoing exposures. Serial measures of concentrations of 
lead in blood or bone, which are better indicators of 
cumulative exposure than one concentration of lead in 
blood,9 would have strengthened this study; indeed, our 
reliance on one measurement for concentration of lead 
in blood might underestimate the contribution of 
lead exposure to mortality. Moreover, we relied on death 
certificates for the underlying cause of death, but they are 
imperfect. We adjusted for co-exposure to cadmium, but 
we were not able to adjust for air pollutants or arsenic, 
both of which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease 
mortality.33 Finally, and perhaps most importantly, 
although we adjusted for an extensive array of potential 
confounders, we cannot exclude residual confounding 
that might result in an overestimation of the effect of 
concentrations of lead in blood, particularly from 
socioeconomic and occupational factors that were either 
not measured or measured inadequately. Yet, the shape 
of the dose-response argues against confounding to 
account for our results because the confounders, which 
are correlated positively with amounts of lead in blood, 
are found primarily in the highest risk groups (table 1); 
the steepest increase in risk occurs at the lower 
concentrations of lead in blood.
In conclusion, our study findings suggest that low-level 
environmental lead exposure is an important risk factor 
for death in the USA, particularly from cardiovascular 
disease. It is not surprising that lead exposure is 
overlooked; it is ubiquitous, but insidious and largely 
beyond the control of patients and clinicians. Although 
reducing the amount of lead in blood might cut a patient’s 
risk of cardiovascular disease mortality,32 it is more 
accurate to view this study as estimating how many 
deaths might have been prevented if historical exposures 
to lead had not occurred. Indeed, this study suggests 
that estimating the contribution of environmental lead 
exposure is essential to understand trends in cardiovascular 
disease mortality and develop comprehensive strategies to 
prevent cardiovascular disease.34,35
