Nanomedicines that co-deliver DNA, RNA, and peptide therapeutics are highly desirable
yet remain underdeveloped for cancer theranostics. Herein, we report self-assembled
intertwining DNA-RNA nanocapsules (iDR-NCs) that efficiently delivered synergistic DNA
CpG and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) adjuvants, as well as tumor-specific peptide neoanti-
gens into antigen presenting cells (APCs) in lymph nodes for cancer immunotherapy. These
nanovaccines were prepared by (1) producing tandem CpG and shRNA via concurrent rolling
circle replication and rolling circle transcription, (2) self-assembling CpG and shRNA
into DNA-RNA microflowers, (3) shrinking microflowers into iDR-NCs using PEG-grafted
cationic polypeptides, and (4) physically loading neoantigen into iDR-NCs. CpG and shRNA
in iDR-NCs synergistically activate APCs for sustained antigen presentation. Remarkably,
iDR-NC/neoantigen nanovaccines elicit 8-fold more frequent neoantigen-specific peripheral
CD8+ T cells than CpG, induce T cell memory, and significantly inhibit the progression
of
neoantigen-specific
colorectal
tumors.
Collectively,
iDR-NCs
represent
potential
DNA/RNA/peptide triple-co-delivery nanocarriers and synergistic tumor immunotherapeutic
nanovaccines.

atural nucleic acids (e.g., DNA, RNA) have inspired the
development of nucleic acid nanotechnology and syn-
thetic functional nucleic acids. Specifically, inspired by the
abilities of natural nucleic acids to structurally code and store
genetic information, nucleic acid nanotechnology utilizes syn-
thetic nucleic acids to precisely engineer nanostructures1–5.
Nucleic acid nanotechnology has enabled the development of
various nucleic acid nanomedicines for biomedical applications,
including drug delivery3–7. Further, inspired by the biological
functions of natural nucleic acids, synthetic functional nucleic
acids have been developed as therapeutics8,9 and targeting
ligands10,11. For instance, unmethylated cytosine–guanine oligo-
deoxynucleotides (CpG) have been extensively investigated as
immunomodulatory cancer therapeutics8,12. CpG triggers the
Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) pathway to activate APCs, such as
dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages13. In addition, RNA
therapeutics, such as shRNA, are another class of nucleic acid
therapeutics that precisely regulate gene expression via RNA
interference14. Empowered by the inherent structure program-
mability and versatile functionalities of nucleic acids, nucleic acid
nanotechnology
enables
engineering
of
multiple
functional
nucleic acids into a single nanomedicine, which is especially of
interest in co-delivering multiple synergistic nucleic acid ther-
apeutics for combination cancer therapy. Towards this end, a
simple technology to construct nucleic acid nanostructures that
incorporate both DNA and RNA therapeutics is highly desirable,
yet remains an underdeveloped field of study. Previously, nucleic
acid nanostructures have been constructed via nucleic acid
hybridization7, and recently via co-crystallization of nucleic acids
with inorganic supplements during rolling circle replication
(RCR) and rolling circle transcription (RCT) to respectively
construct DNA5,15 or RNA6,16,17 nanostructures. However, these
technologies are either limited by complicated design, limited
biostability, or most importantly, the lack of ability to simply
incorporate both DNA and RNA therapeutics into the same
nanomedicine for co-delivery.
Cancer immunotherapy has made encouraging breakthroughs
in the past decades, which modulates the immune system to
treat cancer18. Because the immune system in cancer patients
is compromised by multi-tier immunosuppressive signaling
pathways19,
combination
therapy
is
especially
significant
for cancer immunotherapy by combining synergistic therapeutics
to modulate multiple pathways, via, for example, activating
anticancer
immunostimulatory
pathways

 immunosuppressive pathways. As mentioned, CpG has shown
encouraging clinical efficacy in cancer treatment by activating the
immunostimulatory TLR9 pathway20. Moreover, Janus kinase
(JAK)–signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)
pathways have been shown as promising targets for cancer
immunotherapy21. STAT3, a member of the STAT family, is
immunosuppressive in APCs by multiple mechanisms such as
inducing antigen-specific T cell tolerance22–24. Even worse,
STAT3 suppresses CpG-activated immunostimulation25, sug-
gesting the clinical demand to synergistically activate TLR9
pathway and disarm STAT3 pathway in APCs for combination
cancer immunotherapy26–28. Towards this end, therapeutic CpG
and Stat3 shRNA are promising, yet the clinical applications of
these therapeutics have thus far been hindered by: (1) limited
in vivo nucleic acid biostability (e.g., nuclease susceptibility) or
otherwise costly chemical modification to improve biostability,
(2) suboptimal pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics that
result in rapid clearance and inefficient delivery in vivo,
(3) inefficient intracellular nucleic acid delivery due to negative
charges, (4) limited therapeutic efficacy of monotherapy, and
(5) toxicity of many current nucleic acid delivery vehicles.
Nanovaccines, owing to typically efficient delivery into sec-
ondary lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes (LNs), have been
enthusiastically
explored
for
delivering
immunomodulatory
adjuvants and antigens for cancer immunotherapy29–34, which
together can elicit potent and durable adaptive immunity. While
previous investigation of tumor-associated antigens has yielded
moderate therapeutic efficacy with risks of side effects associated
with autoimmune responses, tumor-specific neoantigens have
emerged as a promising alternative for potent and safe immu-
notherapy. Preclinical and clinical evidences have supported the
key role of neoantigens in tumor immunotherapy35–37. Unlike

 tumor-associated antigens that are expressed in both tumors and
healthy tissues, neoantigens, which are derived from somatic
mutations in tumors, are expressed exclusively in tumor cells but
not in healthy cells. Therefore, the use of neoantigens as vaccine
components would potentially avoid autoimmunity against
healthy tissues, and nanovaccines that co-deliver adjuvants and
neoantigens
are
of
tremendous
interest
for
tumor
immunotherapy29,33.
Herein, we developed biostable iDR-NC/neoantigen complexes
as nanovaccines that incorporated CpG and Stat3 shRNA, as well
as tumor-specific neoantigens for efficient co-delivery and
immunomodulation in cancer immunotherapy. Unlike DNA and
RNA nanostructures that were previously constructed via sepa-
rate RCR or RCT5,16, iDR-NCs are hybrid DNA-RNA nanos-
tructures that are generated via combined RCR and RCT in the
same reaction system, which essentially incorporates both DNA
and RNA therapeutics into the single nanostructures. Moreover,
given the large sizes of microstructures constructed from RCT or
RCR (d: ~ 0.5 − 5 µm), it is essential to shrink them for efficient
drug delivery. Although polyethylenimine (PEI) can meet this
end, the cytotoxicity of highly cationic PEI raises serious safety
concerns16. In this study, we synthesized biocompatible PEG-
grafted polypeptide (PPT-g-PEG) copolymers to shrink the
microflowers (MFs) constructed from combined RCR/RCT.
Specifically, PPT-g-PEG imparts multiple functions to precisely
engineer nanovaccine delivery: (1) the cationic PPTs transform
MFs into NCs to enhance delivery efficiency to LNs at the tissue
level and to APCs at the cellular level, (2) acid-labile PEG not
only ensures high solubility of copolymer and thus effective MF
shrinkage, but also enhances the proton sponge effect to promote
intracellular delivery after PEG shedding and hence exposure of
cationic PPTs in acidic endolysosomes, (3) the hydrophobic PPTs
allows loading of tumor-specific neoantigens into iDR-NCs via
hydrophobic interactions between peptide neoantigens and PPTs
for co-delivery of adjuvants and antigens, and (4) biocompatible
and biodegradable PPT-g-PEG is expected to have good safety
profile. The resulting iDR-NCs synergistically activated APCs,
and iDR-NC/neoantigen complexes elicited potent and durable
tumor-specific antitumor immunity for tumor immunotherapy.
Results
Self-assembly of iDR-NCs as nanoadjuvants. iDR-NCs were
constructed in four steps: (1) Two DNA templates were designed
to
encode
CpG
1826
(sequence:
TCCATGACGTTCCT-
GACGTT) and Stat3 shRNA, respectively; (2) The reaction
condition was optimized to allow concurrent RCR and RCT in
the same solution; (3) Combined RCR and RCT produced tan-
dem CpG and shRNA, which were subsequently self-assembled
into hybrid CpG-shRNA MFs; and (4) MFs were shrunk by
positively-charged PPT-g-PEG copolymers to form iDR-NCs
(Fig. 1). Specifically, we designed a linear phosphorylated DNA
template and a DNA primer for RCR to generate tandem CpG,
and a linear phosphorylated DNA template for RCT to produce
tandem shRNA (Supplementary Table 1). CpG template was
circularized using the DNA primer and T4 DNA ligase, and the
shRNA template was circularized by CircLigase (Supplementary
Fig. 1). To allow RCT and RCR in the same reaction, we opti-
mized the reaction buffer and temperature which permitted
efficient RCR (typically in RCR buffer at 30 °C) and RCT (typi-
cally in RCT buffer at 37 °C) (Supplementary Table 2). It was
found that RCT, but not RCR, was susceptible to change in
reaction temperature and buffer. In RCT buffer at 37 °C, RCR was
still highly efficient, so this condition was chosen for combined
RCR/RCT to efficiently produce nucleic acids (Fig. 2a). Alto-
gether with magnesium pyrophosphate (Mg2PPi), the generated
CpG and shRNA were self-assembled into CpG-shRNA MFs after
24 h reaction, as shown by SEM (Fig. 2b) and XRD analysis
(Supplementary Fig. 2).
To shrink the above MFs to afford nanovaccines, PEGylated
cationic polypeptide PPT-g-PEG was designed and synthesized,
with the expectation of less cytotoxicity than conventional nucleic
acid delivery polymers such as PEI. PPT-g-PEG was synthesized
with PPTs of 45 repeating units of modified L-glutamic acids that
contained 90 units of primary amines, and a series of acid-
responsively-cleavable PEG grafts. The PEG was grafted onto
PPTs via an acid-labile Schiff base linker. PEGylation was
expected
to
enhance
the
solubility,
biocompatibility,
and
antifouling efficacy of PPT-g-PEG. Upon PEG cleavage in acidic
endolysosome, PEG shedding would expose cationic PPTs to
further enhance endosome escape38. To synthesize PPT-g-PEG
(Supplementary Fig. 3), L-glutamic acid was first modified to
introduce an alkyne group using propargyl alcohol, and then
triphosgene was used to transform it into N-carboxyanhydride
(NCA) monomers39,40. PPT was synthesized by controlled ring-
opening polymerization of NCA monomer via an accelerated
nitrogen flow method39. After complete consumption of mono-
mer as determined by 1H NMR, the polymer was purified by
three times of precipitation into diethyl ether. Gel permeation
chromatography showed monomodal molecular weight distribu-
tion with a low polydispersity index of 1.23 (Supplementary
Fig. 4). Next, the pedant alkyne group was transformed into
positively-charged amine via an efficient thiol-yne reaction with
2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone as a radical initiator under
UV light. Subsequently, PEGylation was achieved by forming a
Schiff base between the primary amine of PPTs and aldehyde
from PEG-CHO. All structures were confirmed by 1H NMR
(Supplementary Figs. 5–10).
The next step to construct iDR-NCs was the shrinkage of CpG-
shRNA MFs using the above PPT-g-PEG (Fig. 1). To screen PPT-
g-PEG for optimal shrinkage, CpG-shRNA MFs were respectively
incubated with PPT-g-(PEG)6, PPT-g-(PEG)12, PPT-g-(PEG)18,
and PPT-g-(PEG)24 that all had PPT backbones of 45 repeating
units of modified L-glutamic acids with 6, 12, 18 and 24 copies of
acid-labile PEG grafts, respectively. Note that adding one copy of
PEG would reduce one positive charge in the copolymer. PPT-g-
(PEG)6 with non-cleavable PEG served as a control. 48 h after
incubating MFs with 2.5 mg/mL polymers in PBS, iDR-NCs were
purified by centrifugation to remove free polymers. SEM revealed
that PPT-g-(PEG)6 most effectively shrank the MFs to iDR-NCs,
whereas PPT-g-PEG with 12, 18 and 24 PEG copies induced only
partial shrinkage at best (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 11) likely
because of insufficient positive charges and because crowded PEG
grafts hindered the interaction between PPTs and MFs. Using
iDR-NCs
labeled
with
Alexa
488
via
the
DNA
primer
(Supplementary Fig. 12), flow cytometry suggested that PPT-g-
(PEG)6 yielded the most efficient uptake of polymer-incubated
MFs by RAW264.7 macrophages and DC2.4 cells (Supplementary
Fig. 13). PPT-g-(PEG)6 was then selected for the following
studies. Neither PPT-g-(PEG)6 nor PPT controls displayed NC-
like structures, and PPTs without PEG failed to shrink MFs likely
due to limited solubility (Supplementary Fig. 14). In a polymer
concentration-dependent manner, MF shrinkage was complete
with at least 2.5 mg/mL PPT-g-(PEG)6 (Supplementary Fig. 15),
which was therefore used in the following studies. The process of
NC formation was monitored by SEM at a series of time points
after incubating MFs with PPT-g-(PEG)6. Multiple iDR-NCs
gradually “bubbled” out from the outer layers of each MF at early
stage, and one MF were thus shrunk to multiple iDR-NCs within
a span of up to 2 days (Fig. 2d). The diameters were reduced from
1272 ± 159 nm for MFs to 252 ± 23 nm for iDR-NCs (Fig. 2e),
and the zeta potential was increased from −39 mV for MFs to

 1.5 mV for iDR-NCs due to the positive charge of PPT-g-(PEG)6
(Supplementary Fig. 16). iDR-NCs were further characterized by
atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron micro-
scopy (TEM), and high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 17). The interior structure of iDR-NCs was studied using
focused ionization beam (FIB) that cut iDR-NCs to expose the
hollow interior structures of iDR-NCs, as revealed by SEM
(Fig. 2f). To estimate the yield of CpG and shRNA in iDR-NCs,
CpG MFs, and shRNA MFs were generated in separate RCR and
RCT under the same conditions as mixed RCR/RCT, and the
resulting MFs were washed to remove residual substrates and
then EDTA-treated to dissolve Mg2PPi (Supplementary Fig. 18).
By measuring absorbance at 260 nm, CpG template was estimated
to be replicated for ca. 12 times and shRNA for ca. 4 times in
iDR-NCs, under the assumption that all nucleic acids in MFs
were shrunk into iDR-NCs. Importantly, PPT-g-PEG and iDR-
NCs were significantly less cytotoxic than PEI in RAW264.7
macrophages, demonstrating the biocompatibility of PPT-g-
(PEG)6 (Fig. 2g). Moreover, iDR-NCs showed high biostability
even when incubated in 10% serum for 5 h (Supplementary
Fig. 19).
Efficient intracellular delivery of iDR-NC nanoadjuvants. As
TLR9 (receptor for CpG) resides in the endolysosomes of APCs
and Stat3 mRNA is in the cytosol, efficient intracellular delivery
of iDR-NCs is essential for potent immunomodulation. After
Alexa 488-labeled iDR-NCs were incubated with RAW264.7
macrophages and DC2.4 cells for 3 h, efficient intracellular
delivery of iDR-NCs was observed by confocal microscopy
(Fig. 3a, b) and flow cytometry (Fig. 3c). Specifically, confocal
microscopy revealed massive colocalization of internalized iDR-
NCs with the endolysosome stained by LysoTracker Red,
and owing to shrinkage, the delivery efficiency of iDR-NCs
dramatically outperformed the parent MFs (Fig. 3a, b). Confocal
microscopy with 3D deconvolution clearly revealed iDR-NCs in
the endolysosome of DC2.4 cells, which would allow binding of
CpG with TLR9 for immunostimulation (Fig. 3d; Supplementary
Fig. 20; Supplementary Movie 1). As shRNA and CpG were co-
incorporated into iDR-NCs, these results suggest efficient intra-
cellular delivery of both CpG and shRNA. We hypothesize that
iDR-NCs would be dissociated in the acidic endolysosome to
liberate CpG, and the acid-labile linker in PPT-g-(PEG)6 would
break in acidic endolysosome so that the exposed cationic PPTs
in iDR-NCs would facilitate the endosomal escape of shRNA via
proton sponge effect. Overall, these results provide the basis for
intracellular immunomodulation by iDR-NC nanovaccines.
iDR-NC/antigen co-delivered adjuvants and antigens to APCs.
Co-delivery of adjuvants and antigens into APCs is key for
optimal antigen presentation. To study this, we used Alexa 555-
labeled iDR-NCs and model antigen CSIINFEKL, an epitope of
chicken ovalbumin (OVA) with a cysteine appended on the N-
terminal. To monitor the behaviors by fluorescence, CSIINFEKL
was modified with FITC on lysine that was reported not to affect
its binding with major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I)41.
CSIINFEKL was loaded into iDR-NCs through physical com-
plexation driven by hydrophobic interactions between CSIIN-
FEKL and PTTs. Specifically, iDR-NCs (from 200 µL RCT/RCR
products) were co-incubated with CSIINFEK(FITC)L (100 µM) at
room temperature for 5 h, followed by washing with PBS and
centrifugation for three times to remove free antigen. As deter-
mined by the FITC fluorescence of unloaded antigens, the
amount of CSIINFEKL loaded into the resulting iDR-NC/
CSIINFEK(FITC)L complexes (SEM images in Supplementary

2.1).
Intracellular co-delivery in DCs was then investigated by super
resolution
fluorescence
imaging
using
a
home-built
instant
structured illumination microscope (instant SIM) that enables the
high-speed acquisition of super resolution images with relatively
little photobleaching (which was critical in imaging the easily
photobleached FITC)42. Specifically, DC2.4 cells were incubated
with iDR-NC-Alexa 555/CSIINFEK(FITC)L complexes for 6 h, then
washed before super resolution imaging. Instant SIM revealed a
high degree of colocalization of iDR-NCs with CSIINFEK(FITC)L in
DCs (Fig. 4a), suggesting that iDR-NCs is co-delivered with antigen
and providing the basis for efficient antigen presentation. To
examine antigen presentation, bone marrow derived dendritic cells
(BMDCs) were incubated with iDR-NCs/CSIINFEK(FITC)L com-
plexes for a total of 6, 24, and 48 h before confocal microscopy
observation. For 24-h and 48-h points, cells were washed at 14 h
after
adding iDR-NCs/CSIINFEK(FITC)L,
followed
by further
incubation to investigate the sustainability of antigen presentation.
Compared to free CpG control, iDR-NCs not only enhanced the
uptake of CSIINFEK(FITC)L but also resulted in sustained presence
of CSIINFEK(FITC)L on BMDC surfaces, likely resulting from
sustained antigen presentation of CSIINFEK(FITC)L (Fig. 4b).
Note
that,
at
early
stage,
both
free
CSIINFEK(FITC)L
and
CSIINFEK(FITC)L loaded in iDR-NCs were efficiently internalized
into BMDCs and presented on BMDC surfaces, likely due to
efficient
uptake
of
particulate
CSIINFEK(FITC)L
(formed
by
hydrophobic interactions) as well as strong epitope binding of
CSIINFEK(FITC)L with MHC I on BMDC surfaces.
Synergistic in vitro immunoactivation by CpG/shRNA iDR-
NCs. We studied Stat3 silencing in DC2.4 cells that were treated
with iDR-NCs for 48 h. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR of mRNA
from the treated cells demonstrated the specific silencing of Stat3,
compared with a glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) (Fig. 5a). Treated DCs were further analyzed for
STAT3 phosphorylation at tyrosine 705 (Y705), a prerequisite of
STAT3 activation via dimerization, translocation into nucleus,
DNA binding, and terminal differentiation and growth arrest in
monocytes in response to cytokine stimulation. Specifically, the
as-treated DC2.4 cells were permeabilized and intracellularly
stained using an antibody against phosphorylated STAT3 (p-
STAT3). Lipofectamine-transfected Stat3 siRNA and Stattic, a
STAT3 inhibitor, served as controls. Flow cytometry suggested
that iDR-NCs downregulated p-STAT3 (Fig. 5b), at higher effi-
ciency than siRNA, likely due to efficient delivery and bio-
compatibility of iDR-NCs relative to Lipofectamine.
iDR-NCs were then investigated for immunostimulation in
RAW264.7 macrophages and DC2.4 cells. Cells were treated with
iDR-NCs for 24 h and analyzed for cell-surface expression of
costimulatory factor CD80 and the secretion of proinflammatory
factors interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-12p40, and tumor necrosis factor
α (TNFα). In DC2.4 cells, iDR-NCs elevated CD80 expression, at

compared with CpG or CpG MFs, treatment with iDR-NCs
significantly enhanced the secretion of IL-6, IL-12p40, and TNFα
in DC2.4 cells (Fig. 5d). As expected, Stat3 siRNA alone was not
immunostimulatory. Similarly, iDR-NCs activated RAW264.7
macrophages to elevate CD80 expression and proinflammatory
factor secretion (Supplementary Fig. 22). Altogether, these results
suggest the potent and synergistic immunostimulatory effects of
iDR-NCs.
Delivery of iDR-NCs to LNs and LN APCs in mice. We then
studied the in vivo delivery and immunostimulation of iDR-NCs
in
immunocompetent
C57BL/6
mice.
Locally
administered
nanovaccines exploit the physiological characteristics of lym-
phatic drainage to transport nanovaccines via lymphatics to LNs,
where various lymphocytes reside and immune responses are
orchestrated. The sizes of iDR-NCs fell within the nanoparticle
size range that allow minimal systemic dissemination and effi-
cient lymphatic drainage for LN accumulation31, which moti-
vated us to study LN delivery of these nanoadjuvants. To this end,
iDR-NCs were prepared using NOTA-modified PPT-g-(PEG)6
and then radiolabeled with 64Cu through NOTA chelator. 64Cu-
labeled iDR-NCs were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) at the tail
base or ipsilateral to tumor (i.l.t.), respectively, to C57BL/6 mice
bearing MC38 syngeneic colon adenocarcinoma tumor (Fig. 6a).
I.l.t. injection features proximity with tumor-derived antigens in
its tumor-draining LNs (TDLNs). At 1 day post injection,
draining inguinal (IN) LNs and axillary (AX) LNs were resected
to quantify the radioactivity by γ counting, as well as positron
emission tomography (PET). S.c. injection delivered a total of 3-
fold more iDR-NCs than i.l.t. injection into IN and AX LNs
(Fig. 6b, c). Specifically, the percent injected dose (%ID) of s.c.-
injected iDR-NCs was 0.13% in IN LNs and 0.11% in AX LNs. In
contrast, only 0.046% of i.l.t.-injected iDR-NCs were delivered to
AX TDLNs and a total of <0.02% of iDR-NCs were in IN and AX
non-TDLNs (Fig. 6c). Despite the potential of TDLNs to harbor
tumor antigens, we chose s.c. injection because of its relatively
efficient LN delivery and that exogenous MC38-specific neoan-
tigen was used together with iDR-NCs for antigen-specific
immunomodulation in this study.
As mentioned, potent antigen presentation on APC surfaces
and effective immunomodulation demand co-delivery of adju-
vants and antigens into APCs. We thus studied co-delivery of
Alexa 555-labeled iDR-NC/CSIINFEK(FITC)L complexes after s.c.
injection at the tail base of C57BL/6 mice. At 1 day post injection,
draining IN LNs were resected for flow cytometric analysis of

cells,
F4/80+
macrophages, and CD11c+ DCs, which are major populations
of APCs that can present antigens to naive T cells. 18.2% DCs and
25.4% macrophages were Alexa 555+FITC+, demonstrating
efficient co-delivery of iDR-NCs with peptide antigen to LN
APCs in vivo (Fig. 6d). In comparison, Alexa 555+FITC+ B cells
were <1%. The efficient in vivo uptake of NCs and antigens was
attributed to shrunk sizes of iDR-NC/CSIINFEK(FITC)L com-
plexes. Further, at 1 day after iDR-NC immunization, CD80
expression was elevated in LN DCs and macrophages, indicating
in vivo APC activation (Fig. 6e). The efficient co-delivery and
immunostimulation of iDR-NCs in vivo are expected to elicit
potent T cell responses.

 iDR-NC/neoantigen potentiated T cell responses with memory.
T cell responses against neoantigen-presenting tumor cells play a
central role in cancer immunotherapy. To study iDR-NC/antigen
for neoantigen-specific cancer immunotherapy, we attempted to
analyze T cell responses after immunizing C57BL/6 mice with
iDR-NC/neoantigen complexes. Neoantigens were generated
from somatic tumor mutation and were identified by exome
sequencing and mass spectrometry. We used neoantigen Adpgk
generated from mutation (ASMTNRELM → ASMTNMELM) in
MC38 tumor37. Again, iDR-NC/neoantigen complexes (SEM
images in Supplementary Fig. 21b) were prepared by co-
incubating iDR-NCs with hydrophobic Adpgk to allow physical
complexation of Adpgk with the PPT moieties via hydrophobic
interactions. By quantifying the unloaded Adpgk using UV
absorbance (280 nm), the amount of Adpgk loaded into iDR-NCs
was 2.7 molar equivalents of CpG (CpG: Adpgk = 1: 2.7). Syn-
geneic C57BL/6 mice were immunized with CpG/shRNAStat3-
iDR-NC/Adpgk complexes (2 nmol CpG equivalents, 17 μg
Adpgk) on day 0 for priming and day 14 for boosting. On day 21,
peripheral blood was collected, red blood cells lysed, and CD8+
T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were
stained using a PE-conjugated H-2Db-ASMTNMELM dextramer.
This dextramer is a molecular complex that mimics MHC I
−antigen epitope complexes presented on cancer cells, such that it
can stain T cells that are able to recognize Adpgk-presenting
cancer cells (Fig. 7a. Supplementary Fig. 23). Control CpG +
Adpgk elicited only 1.1% ASMTNMELM-specific CD8+ T cells
among all live (DAPI−) CD8+ cells. In contrast, iDR-NC/Adpgk
induced 9.5% ASMTNMELM-specific CD8+ T cells (Fig. 7b, c),
an 8-fold increase relative to CpG+Adpgk. Moreover, these
ASMTNMELM-specific CD8+ T cells in nanovaccine-immunized
mice upregulated the expression of programmed death receptor 1
(PD-1) (Fig. 7d), an immune checkpoint whose expression on
T cells, especially antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, can be upregu-
lated by immunostimulation43. Thus, the upregulated PD-1
expression on ASMTNMELM-specific CD8+ T cells further
implied potent immunostimulation of iDR-NC/Adpgk. Remark-
ably, on day 49, mice immunized with iDR-NC/Adpgk showed
large fractions of central memory CD8+ T cells (CD8+CD44
+CD62Lhigh), especially Adpgk-specific memory CD8+ T cells
(ASMTNMELM+CD8+CD44+ CD62Lhigh) (Fig. 7e), indicating
durable T cell responses. Again, the potent and durable immunity
was attributed to the potent synergistic immunostimulation of
iDR-NCs as well as the co-delivery of Adpgk with iDR-NCs via
iDR-NCs/Adpgk complexes.
iDR-NC/neoantigen nanovaccines for cancer immunotherapy.
Motivated by the potent and durable T cell responses induced by
iDR-NC/neoantigen complexes, we then studied tumor immu-
notherapy using the above nanovaccines. In addition to durable
immunity, another characteristic of immunotherapy is systemic
efficacy. We studied neoantigen-specific immunotherapy of
MC38 tumor in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. MC38 cells (1 × 105)
were i.v. injected into C57BL/6 mice. On day10, mice were treated
with iDR-NC/Adpgk complexes (2 nmol CpG equivalents, 17 μg
Adpgk), followed by boosting on day 16 and day 22. At the end of
the study (day 40), the metabolic activity of metastatic-like
tumors in lungs was determined using
18F-fludeoxyglucose
(FDG), a metabolic radiotracer for tumor diagnosis. At 1 h post
FDG injection, tumor burden in lung from randomly picked PBS-
treated mice were clearly illuminated in PET-CT and showed
apparently higher FDG signal intensities than background muscle

 (Fig. 8a). Hearts and bladders also showed intense signals due to
high metabolic activity and renal clearance, respectively. Mice
were euthanized and organs of interest (lung and tumor together,
heart, liver, and muscle) were resected, weighted, and radio-
activity measured by γ counting. Tumor and lung together
showed 21-fold higher uptake density (reflected by %ID per g) of
FDG than background muscle (Supplementary Fig. 24). The total
weight of lung and tumor from mice treated with iDR-NC/Adpgk
was reduced by 5 times compared with that of free vaccines
(Fig. 8b, c). Consistently, the FDG radioactivity of lung and
tumor from mice treated with iDR-NC/Adpgk were significantly
less than that of control groups (Fig. 8d). Altogether, iDR-NC/
Adpgk potently and systemically inhibited tumor progression in
neoantigen-specific personalized tumor immunotherapy.
Discussion
Nanovaccines are an important class of nanomedicines that hold
substantial potential for disease treatment including cancer
immunotherapy. Nucleic acid nanovaccines are particularly
attractive because (1) the structural programmability of nucleic
acids enables precise engineering of the nanostructure morphol-
ogy and pinpoint loading of theranostic agents, and (2) nucleic
acids have intrinsic immunomodulatory functionalities (e.g.,
immunostimulatory CpG and poly(I:C)). These characteristics
make nucleic acid nanovaccines especially appealing for combi-
nation cancer immunotherapy, for which nanovaccines that can
co-deliver DNA, RNA, and peptide therapeutics are of significant
interest. For example, immunomodulatory DNA and RNA
adjuvants can exploit independent signaling pathways to syner-
gistically elicit antitumor immunity, and combination of these
nucleic acid adjuvants with peptide antigens can elicit potent and
durable T cell responses, which is critical for efficacious cancer
immunotherapy.
In this study, we first developed nucleic acid nanomaterials,
termed iDR-NCs, that were self-assembled from both DNA and
RNA in a two-in-one reaction system; we then constructed
immunotherapeutic nanovaccines by loading tumor neoantigens
into iDR-NCs. Specifically, we optimized RCR/RCT reactions in
the same solution to concurrently generate tandem DNA and
RNA, which were further self-assembled into intertwining DNA-
RNA MFs. While separate RCR or RCT have been previously
employed to construct DNA or RNA nanostructures5,16, iDR-
NCs represent the first hybrid DNA-RNA nanostructures that
were generated via combined RCR and RCT in the same reaction
system. The combined RCR and RCT essentially incorporated
both DNA and RNA therapeutics into the single nanomedicine.
Specifically, we engineered MFs to be assembled of synergistic
CpG
and
Stat3-silencing
shRNA,
such
that
TLR9
and
STAT3 signaling pathways were synergistically leveraged to elicit
potent immunostimulation in APCs for cancer immunotherapy.
To improve delivery to LNs and LN APCs while maintaining the
biosafety of nanovaccines, we synthesized a biocompatible PPT-g-
PEG copolymer to shrink MFs into NCs. Although poly-
ethylenimine (PEI) may also shrink this type of microstructures,
the cytotoxicity of highly cationic PEI raises serious safety con-
cerns16. To address this issue, we synthesized biocompatible PEG-
grafted polypeptides (PPT-g-PEG) copolymers to shrink MFs.
Further, given the hydrophobicity of PPTs in this copolymer, we
physically loaded tumor-specific neoantigens into iDR-NCs via
hydrophobic interactions between neoantigens and PPTs. Most
neoantigens are hydrophobic, thus loading neoantigens into iDR-
NCs by hydrophobic interactions is expected to be widely
applicable
to
most
neoantigens.

 neoantigens could be loaded into iDR-NCs by chemically con-
jugating neoantigens with PPT-g-PEG. Moreover, this multi-
functional PPT-g-PEG is expected to shed PEG in the acidic
endolysosome of APCs to enhance the proton sponge effect of
cationic PPTs and then facilitate cytosolic delivery of shRNA and
peptide neoantigens. Using quantitative PET imaging, super-
resolution fluorescence imaging and flow cytometry, we demon-
strated that iDR-NC/neoantigen nanovaccines were efficiently
delivered to LNs and LN APCs. We further showed that CpG/
shRNAStat3-iDR-NCs synergistically activated APCs in vitro.
Although the synergistic efficacy between CpG and shRNAStat3
for in vivo T cell responses or tumor immunotherapy has yet to
be investigated, the potent T cell responses and tumor therapeutic
efficacy of iDR-NC/Adpgk are presumably attributed, at least in
part, to this synergistic APC activation.
Potent and durable neoantigen-specific antitumor T cell
responses
were
elicited
by
iDR-NC/Adpgk
nanovaccines.
Neoantigens and neoantigen-specific CTLs have been pre-
clinically
and
clinically
shown
to
be
pivotal
in
tumor
immunotherapy35,36,44–46. However, natural neoantigen-specific
CTLs are extremely rare (e.g., < 0.001% in colorectal cancer47,48),
likely due to low clonal neoantigen burden, inefficient antigen
processing and cross presentation, as well as immunosuppression.
Delivering exogenous neoantigens can enhance the frequencies of
neoantigen-specific CTLs to improve cancer immunotherapy.
Therefore, nanovaccines co-delivering synergistic adjuvants and
neoantigens are promising to potentiate neoantigen-specific
immunity for tumor immunotherapy29,33. In this study, iDR-
NC/Adpgk nanovaccines increased the frequency of Adpgk-
specific CD8+ CTLs, which contributed to significant inhibition
of tumor progression. Worth noting, the potent immunother-
apeutic efficacy of these nanovaccines in metastatic-like tumor
models is particularly significant, given the fact that cancer
metastasis is a primary cause of death of cancer patients and the
ability to effectively treat metastatic tumors is thus highly
desirable.
Combination immunotherapy has been extensively explored in
numerous clinical trials. In the present study, even though no
tumors were regressed by iDR-NC/Adpgk, we believe that com-
bination of these nanovaccines with other therapeutics, such as
checkpoint inhibitors, multi-epitope antigens, antitumor cyto-
kines, as well as chemotherapeutics, have the potential to further
improve therapeutic efficacy and increase regression rates by
exploiting synergistic immunostimulating signaling pathways.
Intriguingly,
upon
immunization
with
iDR-NC/Adpgk,
the expression of immune checkpoint PD-1 was upregulated on
CD8+ T cells. While this PD-1 upregulation suggests T cell
exhaustion, it also implies that combination of PD-1 inhibitors
with iDR-NC/Adpgk could potentially enhance the therapeutic
efficacy. Furthermore, iDR-NCs are expected to deliver multiple
tumor antigen to LNs for a broader spectrum of T cell responses,
which could drive broader tumor cell killing and therefore better
therapeutic efficacy.
Taken together, iDR-NCs represent a general technology to
construct hybrid DNA-RNA nanostructures that can be further
loaded with hydrophobic peptide therapeutics. Specifically, in this
study, CpG and Stat3 shRNA were used as building blocks, with
PPT-g-PEG copolymers as shrinkage materials. The resulting
iDR-NCs were further loaded with tumor neoantigens and served
as potent synergistic nanovaccines for personalized combination
cancer immunotherapy.
Methods
DNA synthesis. DNA was synthesized using reagents from Glen Research (Ster-
ling, VA) and Chemgenes (Wilmington, MA), on an Applied Biosystems ABI 392
DNA synthesizer. DNA was deprotected according to manufacturer’s instructions,
followed by purification on a RP-HPLC (Dionex Ultimate 3000, ThermoFisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA). Dye-labeled DNAs were purchased from IDT (Coral-
ville, IA).
Synthesis of PPT-g-PEG. Synthesis of γ-propargyl-L-glutamate hydrochloride: L-
glutamic acid (6.0 g, 40.8 mmol) was suspended in 200 mL propargyl alcohol.
14.3 mL of chlorotrimethylsilane was added into the suspension dropwise over 2 h
at room temperature, followed by further stirring for 2 days. The reaction mixture
was purified by precipitation into diethyl ether, and further purified by three-times
precipitation from methanol (50 mL) to diethyl ether (0.5 L). The product was
filtrated and dried (4.71 g, yield: 52 %). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CD3OD, ppm): δ 4.73

(m, 2 H).
Synthesis of γ-propargyl-L-glutamate N-carboxyanhydride: γ-propargyl-L-
glutamate hydrochloride (2.0 g, 9.0 mmol) and triphosgene (2.7 g, 3.9 mmol) were
suspended in 100 mL ethyl acetate, and were then stirred under reflux for 3 h until
the reaction mixture became clear. The crude product was extracted with 100 mL
cold nanopure water, 100 mL cold saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and
100 mL cold saturated sodium chloride solution. The organic layer was dried over
MgSO4, concentrated to remove ethyl acetate. Yellow viscous oil was obtained after
twice precipitation from ethyl acetate into hexane and dried (1.23 g, yield: 65%). 1H

Synthesis of PPT: The PPT was synthesized using ring-opening polymerization.
A 25-mL dry Schlenk flask was charged with 3-methoxypropylamine (5.7 mg,
1 equivalent (equiv.)), and PLG NCA (610 mg, 45 equiv.) in anhydrous DMF
(15 mL). Continuous nitrogen flow was used to promote polymerization at room
temperature. 1H NMR was used to monitor the polymerization and <99%
monomer was consumed in 20 h. The polymer was purified by three times’
precipitation from DMF into diethyl ether under vigorous stirring and washed with
diethyl ether to afford a white powder after drying in vacuum at room temperature
(430 mg, yield: 70%). GPC results (Mn 15145 Da, Mw 18691 Da, PDI: 1.23, using
poly(methyl methacrylate)s as calibration standards). 1H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-
d6) δ 8.14 (s, 33 H), 4.67 (d, J = 1.9 Hz, 71 H), 4.24 (s, 34 H), 3.51 (m, 35 H), 3.29 (t,

Synthesis of cationic PPT cysteamine hydrochloride: PPT45 3 (250 mg, 1 eq),
DMPA (212 mg, 25 equiv.), and cysteamine hydrochloride (3385 mg, 900 equiv.)
were added into 10 mL anhydrous DMF in a 50-mL flask. The reaction mixture was
then bubbled by nitrogen flow for 10 min, and placed under UV light with a
wavelength of 365 nm for 2.5 h. The mixture was transferred into a presoaked
dialysis membrane tubing (MWCO 6–8 kDa), dialyzed against nanopure water for
another 2 days, and then lyophilized to get the final product (568 mg, yield: 86%).
1H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 8.61–7.48 (br, 167 H) 4.40 (s, 90 H), 3.55 (s,

2.02–1.56 (m, 69 H).
Synthesis of PEG-CHO: Methoxyl polyethylene glycol (PEG45, 10.0 g, 1 equiv.),
4-formylbenzoic acid (1.5 g, 2 equiv.), N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N
′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC, 1.9 g, 2 equiv.), and 4-(dimethylamino)
pyridine (305 mg, 0.5 equiv.) were mixed in 100 mL dichloromethane in a 250 mL
flask. The reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h at room temperature, and then was
washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate aqueous solution (1 × 100 mL), and
saturated brine (3 × 100 mL). The organic layer was separated and dried over
anhydrous Na2SO4. The organic solvent was then concentrated by rotatory
evaporator to obtain final product (9.3 g, yield: 87%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3)
δ 10.12 (s, 1 H), 8.25–8.20 (m, 2 H), 8.00–7.94 (m, 2 H), 4.55–4.50 (m, 2 H), 3.66 (s,
138 H), 3.39 (s, 3 H).
Synthesis of PPT-g-PEG: Cationic PPTs (100.0 mg, 1 equiv.), PEG-CHO
(60.3 mg, 6 equiv.), and trimethylamine (137.0 mg, 270 equiv.) were added into
5 mL anhydrous DMSO in a 20-mL vial. The reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h
and monitored by 1H NMR to confirm the complete consumption of PEG-CHO.
The mixture was transferred into a presoaked dialysis membrane tubing (MWCO
6–8 kDa), dialyzed against nanopure water (pH 7.4) for another 5 h, changing
water every hour, and then lyophilized to get the final product (142 mg, yield: 83%).
1H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 8.46 (s, 1 H), 8.04 (d, J = 8.1 Hz, 2 H), 7.90 (d, J

(s, 3 H), 2.94–2.60 (m), 2.28 (q, J = 7.2 Hz, 3 H), 2.13 (s).
Synthesis of PPT-g-PEG-NOTA. PPT-g-PEG (2.1 mg, 1 equiv.), NHS-NOTA
(0.22 mg, 10 equiv.), and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (0.84 mg, 100 equiv.) were
added into 1 mL anhydrous DMSO in a 20-mL vial. The mixture was stirred for
overnight and unreacted NOTA was removed using PD-10 columns (GE
Healthcare Life Sciences).
Self-assembly of iDR-NCs and iDR-NC/antigen complexes. Hybrid DNA-RNA
MFs were first synthesized using mixed RCR/RCT. For RCR, linear 5′-phos-
phorylated CpG DNA templates (0.6 µM) were circularized using ligation helper
DNA (1.2 µM) and T4 DNA ligase (10 U/µL; New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA).
This helper DNA also served as the primer for RCR. RCR reaction system con-
tained circular template (0.3 µM), Φ29 DNA polymerase (2 U/µL), 2 mM dNTP,
and 1× BSA in buffer solution (40 mM Tris–HCl, 6 mM MgCl2, 2 mM spermidine,
1 mM dithiothreitol) (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). For RCT, STAT3 linear
template was circularized using CircLigase according to manufacturer’s instruc-
tions (Epicentre, Charlotte, NC). Circular template was directly used for RCT. A
typical RCT system contains template (2.5 µM), T7 RNA polymerase, 2 mM NTP,
1× BSA, and 1× RCT reaction buffer (40 mM Tris–HCl, 6 mM MgCl2, 2 mM
spermidine, 1 mM dithiothreitol) (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). RCR was
carried out at 37 oC for a specified time. Reaction was terminated by deactivation at
90 °C for 10 min. The products were washed twice using PBS and centrifugation
(14,000 rpm, 10 min), and resuspended in PBS before use. If applicable, Alexa 488
or Alexa 555 was labeled on the 5′ end of primers used for RCR; alternatively,
fluorescein-modified UTP (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY) were added into
the above reaction system for fluorophore labeling in MFs. Then, DNA-RNA MFs
were shrunk into NCs by incubating the MFs with copolymers. In a typical
experiment, 2.5 mg/mL copolymer in PBS was mixed with MFs on a vortex for
48 h. At the end of shrinkage, the mixture was centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 10 min) to
remove supernatant, followed by washing twice using PBS.
iDR-NC/antigen complexes were prepared by physical complexation of
hydrophobic antigens with PPT moieties in iDR-NCs. After incubation in PBS, the
mixture was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min for twice. Supernatant was
removed. The amounts of free antigens in supernatant were estimated via FITC
fluorescence intensities (for CSIINFEKL) or via UV absorbance at 280 nm (for
Adpgk), and the loading amount of antigens was accordingly calculated.
Physical characterization of iDR-NCs. For SEM, samples were deposited onto
conductive glass, dried, and rinsed with diH2O. Dry samples were coated with Au
(5 nm of thickness) and observed on an S-4800 SEM. TEM observation of dry iDR-
NCs samples was also conducted. Preparation of NC cross section using FIB and
the following SEM observation of NC cross section was conducted on a Tescan
GAIA FIB/SEM at the Advanced Imaging and Microscopy Laboratory (AIMLAB).
AFM samples were casted on mica substrate, dried, and washed with diH2O. AFM
samples was observed in tapping-mode in air on a PicoForce Multimode AFM
(Bruker, CA) equipped with a Nanoscope® V controller, a type E scanner head, and
an OTESPA AFM cantilever. Results were analyzed using Nanoscope Software (ver.
7.3–8.15). The sizes of iDR-NCs suspended were measured using DLS on a
Nanoparticle Analyzer (HORIBA Scientific, Tokyo, Japan). Bright field or fluor-
escence images of fluorophore-labeled iDR-NCs were taken on a Zeiss LSM 780
confocal microscope (Chesterfield, VA).
Estimation of nucleic acid yields of RCR/RCT. iDR-NCs were treated with 5 mM
EDTA, which chelated Mg2+ and dissolved MFs. DNA/RNA was purified by
removing EDTA, Mg2+, and PPi4− using centrifugation filtering (Millipore Ltd.,
Billerica, MA). The absorbance (260 nm) of the resulting DNA/RNA was deter-
mined on a Genesys 10 s UV-Vis spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA) and converted to the equivalent of CpG or shRNA.
Biostability of iDR-NCs. iDR-NCs was treated with 5 U/mL DNase I (New Eng-
land Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by nuclease deactivation at 75
°C for 10 min. The stability of iDR-NCs against thermal denaturation was per-
formed by heating iDR-NCs at specified temperature for 1 h. The morphologies of
the above treated iDR-NCs were examined using SEM.
Cell culture. RAW264.7 macrophages (ATCC) and MC38 cells (from Dr. Robert
A. Seder Lab at NIAID) were cultured in DMEM medium with L-glutamine. DC2.4
cells (from Dr Jonathan W. Yewdell Lab at NIAID) were cultured in RPMI
medium with L-glutamine. All medium was supplemented with 10% heat-
inactivated FBS and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were cultured in a
humidified atmosphere (5% CO2, 37 °C) in a Biosafety Level II culture room. All
cell lines were confirmed as mycoplasma-negative.
In vitro cell uptake of iDR-NCs. In vitro cell uptake was first studied using
confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry. FITC-labeled AlbiCpG
were incubated with RAW264.7 cells or DC2.4 cells, and stained with Lysotracker
Red DND-99 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and Hoechst 33342 (Life Tech-
nologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturer’s instruction. For confocal
microscopy, cells were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope (Ches-
terfield, VA). For deconvolved confocal microscopy, cells were imaged on a Leica
SP8 (Leica microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). Alternatively, flow cytometry was
used to study the cell uptake using a BD Beckman Coulter flow cytometer (Brea,
CA) and results were analyzed using FlowJo software V10 (TreeStar, Ashland, OR).
Super-resolution imaging on instant SIM. In vitro intracellular uptake of iDR-
NC-Alexa 555/CSIINFEK(FITC)L complexes was studied by super resolution in
DCs, on a home-built instant SIM system42. The DC2.4 cells treated with iDR-NC-
Alexa 555/CSIINFEK(FITC)L were washed with PBS and then immersed in HEPES
buffer (pH 7.4) during imaging. FITC and Alexa 555 were excited using a 488-nm
laser and a 561-nm laser, respectively. Acquired images were deconvoluted using a
home-built software.
RNA interference. siRNA or control were transfected using Lipofectamine2000
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) following manufacturer’s guidance. Stat3 siRNA, pri-
mers for Stat3 mRNA, Stattic, and p-STAT3 antibody were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology.
Concentrations of proinflammatory factors. Proinflammatory factors (TNFα, IL-
6, IL-12p40) in cultured RAW264.7 or DC2.4 cells were quantified using ELISA
according to manufacturers’ instructions. Cell culture medium from cells was
collected at the specified time points post treatment respectively with iDR-NCs or
the control regimes. Medium was diluted according to manufacturers’ instructions.
Cell culture medium was then collected and centrifuged to remove any debris. The
concentrations of cytokines in the culture medium of RAW264.7 or DC2.4 cells
were assayed using ELISA (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
Expression levels of costimulatory factors on APCs. RAW264.7 macrophages
and DC2.4 cells were studied by flow cytometry for the expression levels of cost-
imulatory factor CD80. Cells were seeded into 24-well plate, and one day later
treated with iDR-NCs or the corresponding control regimens at the specified

 concentrations, then cells were harvested and washed, resuspended in Dulbecco’s
PBS and incubated with anti-CD80-PerCP (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) for 0.5 h on
ice. Cells were then washed with Dulbecco’s PBS for three times for flow cytometry
using a BD Beckman Coulter flow cytometer (Brea, CA). Results were analyzed
using FlowJo Software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR).
Animal studies. All animal work was conducted in appliance to the NIH Guide for
the Care and Use of Animals under protocols approved by the NIH Clinical Center
Animal Care and Use Committee. All studies on animals were evaluated in a
blinding manner to investigators without prior knowledge of the specific
treatments.
In vivo delivery of iDR-NC/antigen into LN lymphocytes. Alexa 555 was labeled
on iDR-NCs through an Alexa 555-conjugated primer. CSIINFEKL model antigen
was modified with an FITC to be CSIINFEK(FITC)L. iDR-NC-Alexa 555/CSIIN-
FEK(FITC)L complexes (in 50 μL reaction solution) were s.c.-injected into C57BL/6
mice at the tail base, and one day later, IN LNs were collected and smashed, treated
with collagenase D (1 mg/mL. Sigma) and DNase I (10 U/mL. NEB) for 2 h at 37 °C
to prepare single cells. Cells were filtered through a 40-μm strainer to remove tissue
debris. The resulting single cells were stained with B220 (anti-B220-Alexa647,
clone RA3-6B2, Biolegend) for B cells, F4/80 (anti-F4/80-APC, clone BM8,
eBioscience) for macrophages, and CD11c (anti-CD11c-APC, clone N418, BioLe-
gend) for DCs. Flow cytometry was conducted on a BD LSRFortessa X-50 flow
cytometer. Results were analyzed in macrophage populations using FlowJo soft-
ware (TreeStar, Ashland, OR) and GraphPad Prism 4 (La Jolla, CA).
Dextramer and PD-1 staining on peripheral CD8+ T cells. C57BL/6 mice
(6–8 weeks) were immunized with iDR-NC/Adpgk complexes (Adpgk:
CGIPVHLELASMTNMELMSSIVHQQVFPT) on day 0 and day 14. Blood was
collected from the above treated mice on day 21. Blood cells were enriched by
centrifugation. Red blood cells were lysed using ACK lysis buffer for 5 min at room
temperature. Blood clogs were removed using a plate filter. Cells were washed twice
in PBS and cells were stained using DAPI in PBS buffer supplemented with anti-
CD16/CD32 for 10 min at room temperature. Next, cells were added with dye-
labeled staining cocktail including anti-CD8-APC-Cy7 (BioLegend), Dextramer-PE
(Immudex), anti-PD-1-BV421 (BioLegend), according to manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Cells were stained at room temperature for 30 min, washed, and 100 μL
Cytofix was added into each well to resuspend cells for fixation at 4 °C for 20 min.
Cells were then washed with Perm/Wash buffer, and resuspended for flow cyto-
metric analysis on a BD LSRFortessa X-50 flow cytometer. Data were analyzed
using FlowJo V10 and GraphPad Prism 4.
Immune memory analysis. Mice were vaccinated as describe above. Peripheral
blood was collected to analyze antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and memory T cells.
Immune memory was analyzed by flow cytometric analysis of CD62L and CD44.
Briefly, red blood cells were lysed, and blood cells were then collected, washed with
PBS buffer, blocked with anti-CD16/CD32 for 10 min, followed by adding antibody
cocktail that included anti-CD8-APC-Cy7 (clone 53–6.7, BioLegend), anti-CD44-
PE-Cy5 (clone IM7, BD Bioscience), anti-CD62L-FITC (clone 30-F11, BD
Bioscience), and dead cell-staining DAPI. Cells were stained at room temperature
for 30 min, then washed, and 100 μL Cytofix (BD Biosciences) used to fix cells at 4 °
C for 20 min. Cells were then washed with Perm/Wash buffer (BD Biosciences),
and resuspended for flow cytometry on a BD LSRFortessa X-50 flow cytometer.
Memory CD8+ T cells were analyzed as following: central memory cells (CD44
+CD62Lhigh), effector memory cells (CD44+CD62L−), and naive CD8+ T cells
(CD44-CD62L+).
Tumor model and combination cancer immunotherapy. C57BL/6 mice
(6–8 weeks) were i.v. injected with MC38 cells (1 × 105). On day10, mice were
randomly divided into groups (6–7 per group) that were respectively vaccinated
with (1) PBS, (2) CpG and Adpgk, and (3) iDR-NCs and Adpgk, by subcutaneous
injection in 50 μL at the base of tail on day10, day 16, and day 22 post tumor
inoculation. Tumor burden was quantified at the end of study using FDG radio-
tracer. Specifically, mice were anesthetized for 30 min using isoflurane/O2 (2% v/v)
before injection. Anesthetized mice were injected i.p. with FDG (3.7 MBq per
mouse) in PBS (100 μL). Mice continued to be anesthetized for 1 h, and then, one
mice from each group was randomly picked to be scanned for PET/CT on a
nanoScan PET/CT scanner (Mediso Medical Imaging Systems). Meanwhile, mice
were euthanized and organs of interest were resected, followed by measuring 18F
radioactivity on a gamma-counter (Wallac Wizard 1480, PerkinElmer). The
radioactivity in organs was converted to calculate the percentages of the %ID and %
ID per g in organs of interest. Results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4 (La
Jolla, CA).
