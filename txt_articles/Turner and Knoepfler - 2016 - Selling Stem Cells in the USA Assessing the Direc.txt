Direct-to-consumer marketing of unapproved stem cell interventions is a well-known phenomenon in coun-
tries with lax medical regulations. However, an examination of Internet-based marketing claims revealed
widespread promotion of such interventions by businesses based in the United States. Such commercial
activity suggests that regulatory agencies must better oversee this marketplace.
Businesses marketing putative stem cell
interventions
have
proliferated
across
the U.S. This commercial activity gener-
ates a host of serious ethical, scientific,
legal, regulatory, and policy concerns.
Perhaps the most obvious regulatory
question is whether businesses adver-
tising nonhomologous autologous, allo-
geneic, ‘‘induced pluripotent,’’ or xenoge-
neic ‘‘stem cell therapies’’ are exposing
their clients to noncompliant cell-based
interventions. Such practices also prompt
ethical concerns about the safety and ef-
ficacy of marketed interventions, accu-
racy in advertising, the quality of informed
consent, and the exposure of vulnerable
individuals to unjustifiable risks.
Prior analyses of companies engaged
in direct-to-consumer marketing of stem
cell
interventions
have
not
explicitly
focused on attempting to comprehen-
sively locate and examine U.S. busi-
nesses (Lau et al., 2008; Ogbogu et al.,
2013; Regenberg et al., 2009), although
recent scholarship has identified some
U.S. businesses engaged in such activity
(Connolly et al., 2014). While such com-
panies
have
attracted
some
scrutiny
from researchers and journalists, these
businesses have not yet been examined
in a comprehensive manner (Perrone,
2015; Turner 2015a). This gap in scholar-
ship has contributed to misunderstand-
ings that need to be corrected.
For example, health researchers, pol-
icy-makers, patient advocacy groups,
and
reporters
often
use
the
phrase
‘‘stem cell tourism’’ when addressing
the subject of unapproved cell-based in-
terventions and even in 2016 assume
that U.S. citizens must travel to such
destinations as China, India, Mexico,
and the Caribbean if they wish to access
businesses promoting stem cell proce-
dures for a wide range of clinical indica-
tions. While travel from the U.S. to
international
‘‘stem
cell
clinics’’
con-
tinues, the rhetoric of ‘‘stem cell tourism’’
often fails to acknowledge the hundreds
of U.S. businesses engaged in direct-
to-consumer advertising of stem cell
interventions.
To address the urgent need for better
information concerning the U.S. market-
place for such businesses, we used
Internet key word searches, text mining,
and content analysis of company web-
sites to investigate and analyze this arena.
We used key words and phrases such as
‘‘stem cell treatment’’ and ‘‘stem cell ther-
apy’’ to find putative stem cell businesses
and then evaluated the text on each given
site to refine our analysis. Here we
discuss the variety and prevalence of
different kinds of stem cell interventions
currently advertised and the breadth of
marketing claims that U.S. businesses
make. Our analysis should be useful to
health researchers, policy-makers, regu-
lators, patients and their advocates, and
other parties.
Geographic Locations and
Distribution of U.S. Businesses
Marketing Stem Cell Interventions
Using rigorous Internet-based key word
searches (see Supplemental Information
for details), we found 351 U.S. busi-
nesses engaged in direct-to-consumer
marketing
of
stem
cell
interventions
offered at 570 clinics. For each busi-
ness, we collected the company name,
location(s), website address, advertised
stem cell types, and diseases, injuries,
and other conditions that clinics claim to
treat with stem cell interventions. (Table
S1 lists and describes all of the busi-
nesses we identified).
Figure 1 shows the geographic distri-
bution of such businesses across the
U.S. Many stem cell companies employ
multiple physicians and advertise inter-
ventions available at numerous clinics.
Although such businesses are widely
distributed all over the county, we found
that clinics tend to cluster in particular
states. For example, we found 113 clinics
in California, 104 in Florida, 71 in Texas,
37 in Colorado, 36 in Arizona, and 21 in
New York. ‘‘Hotspot’’ cities including
Beverly Hills (18), New York (14), San An-
tonio (13), Los Angeles (12), Austin (11),
Scottsdale (11), and Phoenix (10) are
designated with stars on the map. Some
metropolitan areas, including Southern
California around Los Angeles and San
Diego, the South Florida region surround-
ing Miami, the greater Denver area, and
the
Dallas-Fort
Worth
metro
region,
have a relatively high number of clinics
even if not all such facilities are techni-
cally in one city (Figure S1). While our an-
alyses here do not explain why these
businesses cluster in particular areas,
we
plan
to
investigate
this
question
further. Possible factors include a rela-
tionship between number of clinics and
population density, regional variations in
use of ‘‘alternative’’ medical interven-
tions, aging population demographics,
and regulatory orientation of state medi-
cal
boards
and
consumer
protection
agencies.

 Types of Advertised Stem Cell
Interventions
We also analyzed the particular stem cell
types
that
businesses
advertise
(Fig-
ure 2A). Most of the businesses we identi-
fied market autologous cell-based inter-
ventions, with an estimated one in five
advertising allogeneic stem cell interven-
tions
sourced
from
amniotic
material
(17%), placental tissue (3.4%), and umbili-
calcords (0.6%). Some clinics marketboth
autologous and allogeneic stem cells.
Of the businesses advertising autolo-
gous stem cell procedures, 61% market
autologous adipose-derived stem cell-
based interventions, 48% market what
they describe as autologous stem cells
obtained from bone marrow, and 4%
market stem cells reportedly obtained
from peripheral blood. Adipose stem
cells were most often referred to using
the adjective ‘‘adipose,’’ but some com-
panies used phrases such as ‘‘fat stem
cells’’ and other businesses advertised
that they use ‘‘stromal vascular frac-
tion’’ or ‘‘SVF.’’ Bone marrow stem cells
were
also sometimes
referred
to
as
‘‘bone marrow aspirate concentrate’’ or
‘‘BMAC.’’
Combinations
of
stem
cell
types were also promoted. We found
that a mixture of autologous adipose
and bone marrow stem cells is the
most commonly advertised ‘‘combination
stem cell therapy.’’
Clinics marketing amniotic stem cells,
amniotic stem cell allografts, or amniotic
stem cell fluid also sometimes used
such terms as ‘‘placenta’’ or ‘‘placental
stem cells.’’ The relative abundance of
U.S. businesses marketing ‘‘amniotic’’
and ‘‘placental’’ stem cells was notable.
The precise source of these products is
not clear in all cases, particularly for allo-
geneic products such as amniotic stem
cells.
One business promotes access to what
it claims are induced pluripotent stem
cells. This company did not indicate the
purported source of induced pluripotent
stem cells or address whether they are
derived on a patient-by-patient basis for
autologous therapy. Another business
markets access to what it describes as
‘‘embryonic stem cell’’ interventions. In
addition, we identified two clinics that
marketed
‘‘bovine
amniotic
cells,’’
a
xenogeneic product, for use in humans.
Approximately 3% of businesses mar-
keted stem cell interventions without
mentioning a particular type of stem cells.
One unanticipated interpretive chal-
lenge
we
encountered
is
that
many
businesses advertise both stem cell inter-
ventions and platelet rich plasma (PRP)
procedures either as the basis for sepa-
rate treatments or as combination ‘‘cell
therapies.’’ Though not an actual stem
cell product, PRP is sometimes marketed
as an autologous ‘‘stem cell treatment’’
derived from peripheral blood. In such
cases, the rhetoric of ‘‘stem cells’’ is pre-
sumably used as a marketing hook in-
tended to attract potential customers
(Turner, 2015b). For the purpose of our
analysis, clinics marketing putative stem
cell interventions derived from peripheral
blood were included within the scope of
our inquiry but clinics only marketing
PRP interventions were excluded.
Marketing Claims about Clinical
Indications
U.S. businesses promoting stem cell in-
terventions claim to treat a wide range of

 diseases and injuries, as well
as advertising stem cells for
cosmetic applications, ‘‘anti-
aging,’’ and other purposes
(Figure
2B).
Some
clinics
occupy relatively specialized
marketplace
niches.
For
example, many cosmetic sur-
gery clinics advertise such
procedures
as
‘‘stem
cell
facelifts’’
and
‘‘stem
cell
breast
augmentation’’
as
well as sexual enhancement
procedures. Orthopedic and
sports medicine clinics often
promote stem cell interven-
tions for joints and soft tissue
injuries.
Other
clinics
take
a much broader approach
and list stem cell interven-
tions for 30 or more diseases
and injuries. Such businesses
commonly market treatments
for neurological disorders and
other
degenerative
condi-
tions,
spinal
cord
injuries,
immunological
conditions,
cardiac diseases, pulmonary
disorders,
ophthalmological
diseases and injuries, and
urological diseases as well
as
cosmetic
indications.
Many
of
these
marketing
claims raise significant ethical
issues
given
the
lack
of
peer-reviewed evidence that
advertised stem cell interventions are
safe and efficacious for the treatment of
particular diseases. Such promotional
claims also generate regulatory concerns
due to apparent noncompliance with fed-
eral regulations.
We also examined the prevalence of
stem cell marketing claims targeted at
parents or guardians of minors. We found
nine clinics each promoting stem cells
for autism and for cerebral palsy. We
also identified 33 marketing claims for
muscular dystrophy (MD), a disease that
primarily though not exclusively afflicts
children. This kind of advertising reveals
another tangled knot of ethical and legal
concerns, as the apparent target audi-
ence for such marketed interventions is
not adults with decision-making capacity
but rather the parents or guardians of chil-
dren. A comparable kind of marketing sit-
uation may exist for Alzheimer’s disease
(27 promoted claims) and other neurode-
generative illnesses where in at least
some cases patients themselves are not
necessarily the primary targets of online
advertising.
Ethical, Regulatory, and Policy
Concerns
Our investigation was in part motivated by
ethical, scientific, and regulatory con-
cerns related to the proliferation of U.S.
businesses
engaged
in
direct-to-con-
sumer marketing of stem cell interven-
tions. However, it was not our intention
to make evaluative statements concern-
ing whether particular companies are
marketing
stem
cell
interventions
in
compliance with federal and state regula-
tions as well as contemporary ethical
standards for medical practice. Nor was
it our intention to make ethical or legal
assertions
about
specific
marketing
claims. We also did not address whether
contemporary ethical, scientific, and legal
standards are being met by
individual businesses. How-
ever, at a broader level we
recognize the importance of
these ethical issues and regu-
latory concerns (Knoepfler,
2015).
Given that many of the
businesses we identified mar-
ket autologous interventions
that do not appear to fit FDA
criteria for homologous use
and minimal manipulation of
cells and tissues, allogeneic
products, combination prod-
ucts, or ‘‘xenogeneic stem
cells,’’
there
are
clear
grounds
for
concern
that
some of the companies we
found are not compliant with
federal
regulations.
There
are related ethical concerns
about information provided
to prospective clients and
the
veracity
of
marketing
claims, the safety and effi-
cacy
of
advertised
proce-
dures, and the risk of phys-
ical, emotional, and financial
harm to already ill or injured
and
vulnerable
individuals.
Recent draft guides issued
by the FDA provide increased
clarity concerning how the
FDA interprets federal regula-
tions applicable to the use,
sale, and distribution of stem cell prod-
ucts. These draft guidance documents
suggest to some observers that the FDA
is preparing to take increased regulatory
action (https://www.statnews.com/2016/
02/08/fda-crackdown-stem-cell-clinics/)
in response to businesses selling stem
cell interventions in a manner that some
critics
have
described
as
exhibiting
a ‘‘Cowboy Culture’’ (http://www.nature.
com/news/stem-cells-in-texas-cowboy-
culture-1.12404).
Some
proponents
of
deregulation
argue that current federal regulations
governing the advertising, processing,
and administration of autologous stem
cells are too onerous and have resulted
in few approved stem cell therapies
reaching
the
American
marketplace
(Chirba and Garfield, 2011; McAllister
et al., 2012). The REGROW Act is an
example of the current push from some
political quarters and even from some

 individual
stem
cell
researchers
for
lowering safety and efficacy standards
for adult stem cell-based interventions.
However, we found that hundreds of
U.S. businesses are already promoting
stem cell interventions for an extraordi-
nary range of clinical indications. Advo-
cates of deregulation will perhaps be
pleased by our findings that many puta-
tive stem cell interventions are currently
available for sale in the U.S. In contrast,
proponents of a marketplace in which
cell-based therapies have traditionally
been
tested
for
safety
and
efficacy
and subject to pre-marketing review
by the FDA will likely be concerned
by
how
many
U.S.
businesses
are
currently marketing stem cell interven-
tions. We are particularly
concerned
that we found many advertising claims
related to
ALS,
Alzheimer’s
disease,
Parkinson’s disease, and many other
conditions for which there is no estab-
lished scientific consensus that proven
safe and efficacious stem cell treat-
ments now exist.
Given that we identified 351 businesses
actively advertising stem cell products
in the U.S., it is fair to ask whether regula-
tory inaction has emboldened entrepre-
neurial
physicians
and
other
market
participants. We place a high value on
the imperative to provide patients with
safe and efficacious interventions and
see a need for more effective regulation
of the U.S. marketplace for stem cell inter-
ventions. Our analysis should serve as
a valuable resource for contemporary
debate
concerning
whether
the
U.S.
marketplace for stem cell interventions is
adequately monitored and regulated by
the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission,
state medical boards, and other agencies
tasked with promoting patient safety
and accurate advertising (https://www.
federalregister.gov/articles/2015/10/30/
2015-27703/draft-guidances-relating-to-
the-regulation-of-human-cells-tissues-or-
cellular-or-tissue-based).
Weighing Risks and Benefits
Associated with Identifying
Marketing Stem Cell
Interventions
While examining the U.S. marketplace
for
direct-to-consumer
advertising
of
stem cell interventions, we gave careful
consideration to possible risks associ-
ated with identifying and documenting
specific businesses engaged in such
commercial activity. We acknowledge
that a public record containing locations
and websites of businesses marketing
stem cell interventions could be misap-
propriated and misused for marketing
purposes, be used as a search tool by
patients seeking particular procedures,
or even be used to claim that, with so
many businesses already operating in
the
U.S.,
de
facto
deregulation
has
occurred
and
it
is
too
late
for
the
FDA
and
other
agencies
to
provide
more robust regulatory oversight of this
marketplace. While we recognize these
risks, we argue that the benefits associ-
ated
with
a
detailed
examination
of
U.S.
businesses
marketing
stem
cell
interventions outweigh potential risks.
We also want to emphasize that we
analyzed businesses that are already
readily
identifiable
and
take
multiple
steps to market their products. Patients
have little difficulty finding stem cell
clinics and comparable businesses on
the Internet. The best way to address
ethical,
legal,
and
scientific
issues
related to such businesses is to acknowl-
edge
their
existence,
examine
and
evaluate
their
marketing
claims,
and
conduct public debates and policy dis-
cussions in the most evidence-based
manner possible.
