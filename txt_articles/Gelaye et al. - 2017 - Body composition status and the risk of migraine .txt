Body composition status and the risk of
migraine
A meta-analysis
ABSTRACT
Objective: To evaluate the association between migraine and body composition status as esti-
mated based on body mass index and WHO physical status categories.
Methods: Systematic electronic database searches were conducted for relevant studies. Two
independent reviewers performed data extraction and quality appraisal. Odds ratios (OR) and con-
fidence intervals (CI) were pooled using a random effects model. Significant values, weighted
effect sizes, and tests of homogeneity of variance were calculated.
Results: A total of 12 studies, encompassing data from 288,981 unique participants, were
included. The age- and sex-adjusted pooled risk of migraine in those with obesity was increased
by 27% compared with those of normal weight (odds ratio [OR] 1.27; 95% confidence interval
[CI] 1.16–1.37, p , 0.001) and remained increased after multivariate adjustments. Although
the age- and sex-adjusted pooled migraine risk was increased in overweight individuals (OR
1.08; 95% CI 1.04, 1.12, p , 0.001), significance was lost after multivariate adjustments.
The age- and sex-adjusted pooled risk of migraine in underweight individuals was marginally
increased by 13% compared with those of normal weight (OR 1.13; 95% CI 1.02, 1.24, p ,
0.001) and remained increased after multivariate adjustments.
Conclusions: The current body of evidence shows that the risk of migraine is increased in obese
and underweight individuals. Studies are needed to confirm whether interventions that modify
obesity status decrease the risk of migraine. Neurology® 2017;88:1795–1804

Both migraine and obesity are conditions associated with substantial personal and societal bur-
dens.1 As obesity is a potentially modifiable risk factor, the relationship between migraine and
obesity has been a focus of research interest for the last decade.1–3 Although several studies
support that obesity is associated with an increased risk of migraine, results are inconsistent with
regards to included populations, how obesity status is categorized, and other features of indi-
vidual study design and conduct, and the conclusions drawn.1,4
In the extant literature of studies examining the migraine–obesity association, population
inclusion criteria have varied by important modifiers of both disorders, most notably age and
sex. While some studies included adults of all ages,5–7 others were limited to younger3,8,9 or
older10–12 populations, whereas others stratified by age (e.g., ,50 and $50 years).13,14 Likewise,
some studies included both men and women (combined or stratified),1 whereas others were
limited to only women.3,9–12
The operational definition of exposure and outcome categories has also varied substantially
across studies. Although most studies reported using the WHO physical status categories,15
some compared obese individuals (body mass index [BMI] $30) with those who were nonobese
(e.g., underweight, overweight, and normal weight combined [BMI ,30]),12,14 others compared

others
compared those in partial obesity grades
(e.g., BMI 30–34.9, BMI 35–39.9, BMI

(table e-1 at Neurology.org).
Prior research from our team, utilizing 2
distinct populations, demonstrated that the
association between migraine and obesity was
greater in younger (,50–55 years) than old-
er individuals and women than men.13,14
Given these findings, we hypothesized that age
and sex are important covariates for the
migraine–obesity association and that differ-
ences in the strength of this association across
studies were likely attributable to differences
in study methodology, particularly in regards
to age, sex, and obesity status categorization,
across the included populations. Thus, we
conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the
pooled risk of migraine by body composition
status as characterized by the WHO physical
status categories and the influence of age and
sex on this relationship.
METHODS Information sources and study selection.
This meta-analysis was conducted according to guidelines of
Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology.16 Sys-
tematic searches of peer-reviewed, published research articles in-
dexed in PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of
Science, BIOSIS, and Science Direct from inception until Feb-
ruary 2016 were undertaken using key search terms related to
obesity and migraine. Key search terms included “migraine and
obesity,” “migraine and body mass index,” “migraine and BMI,”
“headache and obesity,” “headache and body mass index,” and
“headache and BMI.” One reviewer (H.L.N.) performed initial
eligibility screening by assessing titles and abstracts of all results.
Following initial screening, 2 reviewers (H.L.N., B.G.) inde-
pendently reviewed full-text copies of potentially eligible articles.
Disagreement was resolved by discussion with a third reviewer
(B.L.P.).
Eligibility criteria. Studies were included in the meta-analysis if
they met the following criteria: (1) full-length articles published
in peer-reviewed journals; (2) observational studies (prospective
cohort, retrospective cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional); (3)
reported quantitative summaries on the relationship between
BMI and migraine (e.g., counts, prevalence, odds ratios [ORs]);
(4) evaluated study participants $18 years of age at time of
outcome assessment; (5) utilized comparison group without the
exposure or outcome; and (6) utilized the WHO physical status
categories for non-Asian populations. Exclusion criteria were (1)
non-human studies; (2) non-English language; (3) case series or
case reports; (4) review articles or letters to the editor; and (5)
multiple reports from the same cohort. Study authors were
contacted to request additional data in all cases where studies
fulfilled all inclusion and exclusion criteria except for use of the
WHO physical status categories for non-Asian populations.
Study appraisal and evaluation of risk of bias. Information
from each study was compiled using a data extraction sheet that
included first author name, publication year, sample country ori-
gin, study design, sample size, study population characteristics
(e.g., age, sex), and method of migraine and obesity classification.
The risk of bias in individual studies was evaluated based on
a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cross-sectional
studies
(table
e-2;
ohri.ca/programs/clinical_epidemiology/
oxford.asp).17,18 Publication bias was assessed by visual inspec-
tion of funnel plots and by the Egger test.
Statistical analyses. OR and 95% confidence interval (95%
CI) were used as measures of association. If a study did not report
ORs, but reported the frequency of migraine according to WHO
physical status categories based on the BMI, ORs were calculated,
and the corresponding author was contacted for unpublished data
whenever possible. Given that the included studies differed with
regard to population samples, methods of exposure and outcome
ascertainment, and potential confounders adjusted for, the ORs
were pooled using the random effects model that included
between-study heterogeneity.19–21 The pooled estimates were
consistent when analyses were repeated using a fixed-effects
model. In addition, sensitivity analyses were conducted. The
first sensitivity analysis consisted of omitting one study at a time
and recalculating the pooled ORs for the remainder of those
studies in the meta-analysis and that showed that no single study
substantially influenced the pooled estimates. Second, sensitivity
analyses excluding the study with the largest sample size from the
multivariate adjusted OR summary analysis were conducted.
Third, sensitivity analyses were conducted to compare outcome and
exposure ascertainment methods (self-report vs non–self-report).
Finally, sensitivity analyses excluding the low-quality studies
(i.e., ,7/10 on the NOS) were planned but not needed as the
NOS score was $7 for all included studies. ORs and 95% CIs
are reported for the relationship of obesity status with migraine
on forest plots, with I2 statistics, to evaluate heterogeneity. Due
to variations in level of adjustment for confounding across
studies, we conducted separate analyses for unadjusted, sex- and
age-adjusted, and multivariate adjusted studies. The list of
adjustment variables for each study included in the meta-analyses
is indicated in table e-3.
RESULTS Studies retrieved. Figure 1 shows the study
selection process and literature search results. The
systematic search yielded 4,966 references, of which
2,655 were unique. The title and abstract reviews
rejected 2,610 references, yielding 45 candidate ab-
stracts. A subsequent full-text review rejected 33 of
these
references,

 both sexes did not adjust or stratify for sex.25 The
majority of the studies utilized self-reported height and
weight to estimate obesity status (n 5 82,3,6,9,12,13,22,24)
and half utilized self-report of non–International
Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) classi-
fication of migraine (n 5 62,3,9,12,14,22). The modified
Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment scores for all
studies ranged between 7 and 10 out of 10 total points
(table e-2).
Association between obesity (BMI ‡30) and migraine.
The OR of migraine for obese as compared with nor-
mal weight individuals ranged from 0.55 (95% CI
0.38–0.8023) to 2.56 (95% CI 1.33–4.9425) for
unadjusted, from 0.93 (95% CI 0.63–1.3923) to
2.59 (95% CI 1.35–4.9824) for age- and sex-
adjusted, and from 0.70 (95% CI 0.60–1.106) to
3.83 (95% CI 1.77–8.2624) for multivariate adjusted
models (figure 2). In pooled estimates, the OR of
migraine in obese compared with normal weight in-
dividuals was 1.05 (95% CI 0.93–1.19) in the
unadjusted model, 1.27 (1.16–1.37) in the age- and
sex-adjusted model, and 1.21 (95% CI 1.08–1.34) in
the multivariate adjusted model (figure 2). Approxi-
mately 84.5% of the variability between studies’
measures of association was due to the presence of
heterogeneity (I2 statistic, p , 0.001). A sensitivity
analysis was done excluding the study with the largest
sample size12 from the multivariate adjusted OR
summary analysis. In this sensitivity analysis, the
multivariate OR for the remaining studies (OR 1.22;
95% CI 1.08–1.37) was similar to the multivariate
adjusted pooled OR for the complete dataset.
Finally, visual inspection of the funnel plot did not
show evidence of a significant publication bias,
confirmed by the Egger test for publication bias (H0:
intercept 5 2.17; p value 5 0.06).
Association between overweight (BMI 25–29.9) status
and migraine. The OR of migraine for overweight as
compared with normal weight individuals ranged
from 0.52 (95% CI 0.31–0.8623) to 1.65 (95% CI
1.01–2.6924) for unadjusted, from 0.85 (95% CI
0.50–1.4523) to 1.61 (95% CI 0.99–2.6324) for
age- and sex-adjusted, and from 0.87 (95% CI
0.77–0.9822) to 1.52 (95% CI 0.84–2.7524) for

 multivariate adjusted models (figure 3). In pooled
estimates, the OR of migraine in overweight com-
pared with normal weight individuals was 0.90 (95%
CI 0.81–1.00) in the unadjusted model, 1.08 (1.04–
1.12) in the age- and sex-adjusted model, and 1.01
(0.96–1.07) in the multivariate adjusted model (fig-
ure 3). Approximately 45.2% of the variability
between studies’ measures of association was due to
heterogeneity assessed through the statistic I2 (p 5
0.034) in multivariate adjusted model. In a sensitivity
analysis excluding the study with the largest sample
size,12 the multivariate OR for the remaining studies
(OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.96–1.08) was similar to the
multivariate adjusted pooled OR for the complete
dataset.
Association between underweight (BMI <18.5) status
and migraine. The OR of migraine for underweight
individuals compared with normal weight ranged
from 0.59 (95% CI 0.21–1.6413) to 3.93 (95% CI
0.69–22.2023) for unadjusted, from 0.38 (95% CI
0.05–2.9623) to 6.30 (95% CI 0.90–43.9823) for
age- and sex-adjusted, and from 0.50 (95% CI
0.17–1.5013) to 1.92 (95% CI 1.16–3.2014) for
multivariate adjusted models (figure 4). In pooled
estimates, the OR of migraine in underweight in-
dividuals as compared with normal weight individuals
was 1.22 (95% CI 1.07–1.38) in the unadjusted
model, 1.13 (1.02–1.24) in the age- and sex-adjusted
model, and 1.12 (1.03–1.21) in the multivariate
adjusted model, with no evidence of heterogeneity
(I2 5 3.9%, p 5 0.40; figures 2 and 3). In a sensi-
tivity analysis excluding the study with the largest
sample size,12 the multivariate OR for the remaining
studies (OR 1.13; 95% CI 1.02–1.25) was similar to
the multivariate adjusted pooled OR for the complete
dataset.
Sensitivity analysis. When restricting analyses to those
studies that used ICHD migraine diagnoses vs self-
report, the overall effect size by the pooled estimates
did not materially change (figure e-1). In addition,
although inferences are limited by the small number
of studies that included measured BMI, when re-
stricting analyses to those studies that used self-
reported vs measured BMI, the effect sizes remained
similar (figure e-2).

 covariates for the increased risk. Although the crude
risk of migraine (i.e., when not adjusting for age and
sex) was not increased in those with obesity, the
combined pooled effect after adjusting for age and sex
alone demonstrated a 27% increased risk of migraine
in those with obesity, which remained significant
after multivariate adjustments. This finding sub-
stantiates the data demonstrating an association
between obesity and an increased risk of migraine and
emphasizes the importance of age and sex as co-
variates.1 While this increased risk is moderate (being
of similar magnitude to the risk associated with
ischemic heart disease29,30 and bipolar disorders31),
the recognition of this risk is important given that
obesity is a potentially modifiable disease risk factor
for migraine. Further, it supports the need for
research to determine whether interventions to reduce
obesity decrease the risk of migraine. Limited data in
uncontrolled studies suggest that morbidly obese
episodic and chronic migraineurs who undergo bari-
atric surgery have a reduction in monthly frequency
and headache severity 3 to 6 months after surgery.32–35
In addition, although several well-designed aerobic
exercise trials have demonstrated efficacy for reducing
headache days and pain severity in those with
migraine, it remains unclear as to whether this is
related to the exercise itself or as a result of weight
loss.32
We also found that being underweight (BMI ,
18.5) was associated with a small increased risk of
migraine. After adjusting for age and sex, the risk of
migraine in underweight individuals was increased by
13% and remained significant after multivariate ad-
justments. While less controversial than the associa-
tion between migraine and obesity, likely due to the
low prevalence of individuals with underweight body
composition, a similar finding was reported in only
26,22 of the 12 studies included in the meta-analysis.
Taken together with obesity-related migraine risk,
this finding supports that both excessive and insuffi-
cient adipose tissue is associated with an increased risk
of the migraine.
A prior meta-analysis evaluating obesity status and
the association with migraine in a total of 247,828
unique individuals similarly reported an increased risk
of migraine in individuals with obesity and those who
were underweight.36 However, the risk of migraine
was somewhat less in those with obesity (14%) and
somewhat more in underweight (21%) individuals
than we found in the current meta-analysis. While
the majority of the articles included in both meta-
analyses were similar, several differences are of note.
First, we excluded studies that did not use WHO
physical status categories for non-Asian populations
and those that only utilized BMI as a continuous
variable. The prior meta-analysis included individuals
from an exclusively Asian population (for which dif-
ferent BMI cutoffs portend similar disease risk com-
pared with non-Asian populations) and populations
that did not strictly utilize WHO physical status cat-
egories for non-Asian populations. In addition, in the
current meta-analysis we excluded populations from
overlapping datasets. Finally, wherever possible, we
contacted authors for additional data if not presented
in the article and thus were able to include large
populations that were unable to be fully included in
the prior meta-analysis (e.g., second Health Survey of
Nord-Trondelag
County
[HUNT-2],
Women’s
Health Study, National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey, Australian Longitudinal Study on
Women’s Health).3,5,11,12,14
Mechanisms for the association between migraine
and body composition are not fully known. Since the
mid-1990s, adipose tissue has been increasingly
viewed as an endocrine organ that actively secretes
a wide range of bioactive signaling molecules that
have autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine functions,
including adipiocytokines (e.g., adiponectin), proin-
flammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin [IL]–6, tumor
necrosis factor–a), sex hormones, and others.37 With
changes in body composition (increases and de-
creases), the production and secretion of these mol-
ecules from adipocytes changes.
Age and sex differences in the distribution and
metabolic function of adipocytes from adipose tissue
have also been described and likely contribute to the
age and sex differences in the association of obesity
and underweight body composition with migraine.1
Human data support that several of these obesity-
related signaling molecules are altered in those with
migraine at baseline when pain-free (e.g., adiponec-
tin, resistin) and during acute migraine pain (adipo-
nectin, IL-6).32 Further, recent animal data have
demonstrated that obesity is associated with both
an augmented basal and acute trigeminovascular
response to stimulation and may be capable of prim-
ing the trigeminovascular system to be responsive to
otherwise innocuous stimuli.38,39 Finally, it is also
possible other factors such as changes in physical
activity, medications, the presence of comorbidities
(e.g., depression), or other medical conditions con-
tribute to the relationship between migraine and obe-
sity and underweight status.
There are several limitations of this meta-analysis.
Half (n 5 6) of the included studies utilized non-
ICHD criteria and the self-report of migraine, thus
introducing potential recall bias. In addition, over
half (n 5 8) of the included studies utilized self-
report of body mass index to estimate obesity status.
Previous research has shown that individuals with
migraine are more likely to underestimate their
BMI.40

 This type of differential misclassification of expo-
sure (i.e., underestimation of BMI) has been reported
to bias the measure of association closer to the null.
Thus, the reported measures of association may be
stronger than presented in the current meta-analysis.
Finally, the disease risk of obesity varies across races,
with differing BMI categories holding similar disease
risk for Asian and non-Asian populations. Although
we excluded studies utilizing predominantly or exclu-
sively Asian populations and we categorized obesity
status based on the physical status for non-Asian pop-
ulations, some studies that were included in the current
meta-analysis did include a small percentage (,9%) of
Asian individuals in their cohorts. Given that the dis-
ease risk in Asian populations is increased at lower BMI
categories than for non-Asian populations, it is possible
that their inclusion may have slightly attenuated our
current findings.
There are several strengths of the current meta-
analysis. First, we were able to include data from over
288,000 unique individuals. In addition, we utilized
uniform and consistent obesity status categories based
on the WHO physical status categories for non-Asian
populations and found that the migraine risk is not
equivalent in overweight (nonsignificant) and obese
(significant) individuals vs normal weight. This is
consistent with prior research demonstrating that
the migraine risk increases with increasing obesity sta-
tus from normal to overweight to obese.13 It also
underscores the importance of using uniform obesity
status categories in migraine research. For example,
comparing normal weight individuals (BMI18.5–
24.9) with the combined group of overweight and
obese individuals (including BMI 25–401) may
yield findings that are attenuated or even negative vs
when compared with only obese [BMI $30] in-
dividuals. As such, the sensitivity of the studies can be
improved by disaggregating the combined groups
into obese and overweight groups. Finally, in cases
where studies met all inclusion criteria except for the
BMI categories, we attempted to contact authors for
additional information and for which all but 2 con-
tacted authors responded. Most notably, this allowed
us to include data from the HUNT-2 study, which
utilized both ICHD migraine criteria to categorize
migraine and measured height and weight for BMI.
The current study substantiates that obesity and
underweight status are associated with an increased
risk of migraine, and that age and sex are important
covariates of this association. These data suggest that
clinicians treating migraine patients should be aware
of this association. Further research to better under-
stand the mechanisms underlying this association
has the potential to advance our understanding of
migraine and lead to the development of targeted
therapeutic strategies based on obesity status.
