Vaccination is the most effective intervention to reduce 
morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable dis-
eases in young children (1). Data from the 2016 National 
Immunization Survey-Child (NIS-Child) were used to assess 
coverage with recommended vaccines (2) among children aged 
19–35 months in the United States. Coverage remained ≥90% 
for ≥3 doses of poliovirus vaccine (91.9%), ≥1 dose of measles, 
mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) (91.1%), ≥1 dose of 
varicella vaccine (90.6%), and ≥3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine 
(HepB) (90.5%). Coverage in 2016 was approximately 1–2 
percentage points lower than in 2015 for ≥3 doses of diphtheria 
and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP), 
≥3 doses of poliovirus vaccine, the primary Haemophilus 
influenzae type b (Hib) series, ≥3 HepB doses, and ≥3 and 
≥4 doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), with no 
changes  for other vaccines. More direct evaluation of trends 
by month and year of birth (3) found no change in coverage 
by age 2 years among children included in combined data from 
the 2015 and 2016 NIS-Child (born January 2012 through 
January 2015). The observed decreases in annual estimates 
might result from random differences in vaccination coverage 
by age 19 months between children sampled in 2016 and those 
sampled in 2015, among those birth cohorts eligible to be 
sampled in both survey years. For most vaccines, 2016 coverage 
was lower among non-Hispanic black* (black) children than 
among non-Hispanic white (white) children, and for children 
living below the federal poverty level† compared with those 
living at or above the poverty level. Vaccination coverage was 
generally lower among children insured by Medicaid (2.5–12.0 
percentage points), and was much lower among uninsured 
children (12.4–24.9 percentage points), than among children 
with private insurance. The Vaccines for Children§ (VFC) 
program was designed to increase access to vaccines among 
children who might not otherwise be vaccinated because of 
* Child’s race/ethnicity was reported by his/her parent or guardian. Children 
categorized in this report as white, black, American Indian/Alaska native, Asian, 
native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander, or multiple races were identified as 
non-Hispanic by the parent or guardian. Children identified as being of multiple 
races had more than one race category designated. Children identified as 
Hispanic might be of any race.
† Poverty level uses income and family size to categorize households into those 1) at 
or above the poverty level, and 2) below the poverty level. Poverty level was based 
on 2015 U.S. Census poverty thresholds (https://www.census.gov/data/tables/
time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html).

inability to pay. Greater awareness and facilitating use of VFC 
might be helpful in reducing these disparities. Efforts should 
also be focused on minimizing breaks in continuity of health 
insurance and eliminating missed opportunities to vaccinate 
children during visits to health care providers. Despite the 
observed disparities and small changes in coverage from 2015, 
vaccination coverage among children aged 19–35 months 
remained high and stable in 2016.
The NIS-Child uses a random-digit–dialing sample of 
landline and cellular telephone numbers to contact parents or 
guardians of children aged 19–35 months in the 50 states, the 
District of Columbia, selected local areas, and U.S. territories.¶ 
Parents/guardians are interviewed by telephone to collect 
sociodemographic and health insurance information for age-
eligible children in the household. With consent of parent 
or guardian, a survey is mailed to all identified vaccination 
providers to collect dates and types of all vaccines administered 
to the child. Vaccination coverage estimates use only provider-
reported vaccination data. NIS-Child methodology, including 
weighting procedures, has been described previously.** The 
household interview response rate†† was 33.9% from the 
combined landline/cell phone sample. Among households 
with completed interviews, 54.6% had adequate vaccination 
data from providers,§§ yielding 14,988 children available for 
determination of national coverage estimates for 2016. Logistic 
 ¶ Estimates for states, selected local areas, and territories are available online at 
https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/childvaxview/data-
reports/index.html. The local areas sampled separately for the 2016 NIS-Child 
included areas that receive federal Section 317 immunization funds and are 
included in the NIS-Child sample every year (Chicago, Illinois; New York, 
New York; Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania; Bexar County, Texas; and 
Houston, Texas) and two additional sample areas (El Paso County, Texas and 
Dallas County, Texas). The 2016 NIS-Child was also conducted in Guam, 
Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This report includes national 
estimates, excluding the territories.
 
** Further details regarding the statistical methodology of NIS-Child are available 
in the NIS-Child Data User’s Guide 2015, which is available at https://www.
cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/nis/datasets.html.
 
†† The Council of American Survey Research Organizations (CASRO) household 
response rate is calculated as the product of the resolution rate (percentage of 
the total telephone numbers called that were classified as nonworking, 
nonresidential, or residential), screening completion rate (percentage of known 
households that were successfully screened for the presence of age-eligible 
children), and the interview completion rate (percentage of households with 
one or more age-eligible children that completed the household survey). The 
CASRO household response rate is equivalent to the American Association for 
Public Opinion Research type 3 response rate http://www.aapor.org/AAPOR_
Main/media/publications/Standard-Definitions20169theditionfinal.pdf.
 
§§ Children with receipt of at least one vaccination reported by a provider and those 
who received no vaccinations were considered to have adequate provider data.

regression was used to assess the association of race/ethnicity 
with vaccination coverage, adjusting for poverty status. T-tests 
on weighted data were used to evaluate differences in coverage 
estimates by demographic characteristics; differences were 
considered to be statistically significant for p-values <0.05. 
Trends in vaccination coverage by ages 19, 24, and 35 months 
were evaluated by month and year of birth using weighted 
linear regression (3). Linear trends were estimated using 
combined data from 2015 and 2016 NIS-Child (births from 
January 2012 through January 2015), and an expanded analysis 
of the 2012–2016 data (births from January 2009 through 
January 2015). Results by age 24 months (2 years) most closely 
approximate the average age at vaccination assessment in the 
annual NIS-Child sample (28 months).
2016 Vaccination Coverage
Coverage remained ≥90% for ≥3 doses of poliovirus vaccine 
(91.9%), ≥1 dose MMR (91.1%), ≥1 dose of varicella vaccine 
(90.6%), and ≥3 doses of HepB (90.5%) (Table 1). Coverage 
was lowest for ≥2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine (HepA) (60.6%), 
the combined 7-vaccine series (70.7%),¶¶ the HepB birth dose 
(71.1%), and a completed series of rotavirus vaccine (74.1%). 
Only 0.8% of children received no vaccinations.
Vaccination Coverage by Race/Ethnicity, Poverty 
Status, and Type of Health Insurance
Compared with white children, black children had lower 
coverage with ≥3 and ≥4 doses of DTaP
, the primary and full 
series of Hib, ≥3 and ≥4 doses of PCV, ≥2 doses of HepA, the 
completed rotavirus vaccine series, and the 7-vaccine series 
(Table 2). For ≥3 doses of DTaP
, the primary series of Hib, 
and ≥3 doses of PCV, these disparities were not statistically 
significant after adjustment for poverty status; however, for 
the remaining vaccines, racial/ethnic disparities persisted 
only among children living at or above poverty (data not 
shown). For example, coverage with ≥4 doses of DTaP was 
similar for white and black children below poverty (75.6% 
and 76.6%, respectively); among children living at or above 
poverty, coverage rates among white and black children were 
86.8% and 77.2%, respectively. Among children at or above 
poverty, a higher proportion of black children than white 
children (25.8% of black children compared with 10.4% of 
white children) were living just above the poverty level (up to 
138% of poverty). The proportion of white children living in 
households with an income to poverty ratio of ≥4 was twice that 
 
¶¶ The combined 7-vaccine series (4:3:1:3*:3:1:4) includes ≥4 doses of DTaP; 
≥3 doses of poliovirus vaccine; ≥1 dose of measles-containing vaccine; ≥3 or 
≥4 doses of Hib (depending upon product type of vaccine); ≥3 doses of HepB; 
≥1 dose of varicella vaccine; and ≥4 doses of PCV.
of black children (41.5% and 20.4%, respectively). Rotavirus 
vaccination coverage was lower among Hispanic (73.0%) than 
among white (77.3%) children.
For most vaccines, coverage among children living below 
the federal poverty level was lower than coverage among those 
living at or above the federal poverty level (Table 2). The larg-
est gaps were for rotavirus vaccine (12.7 percentage points), 
≥4 PCV doses (7.4 percentage points), the 7-vaccine series (6.5 
percentage points), and the full series of Hib (6.2 percentage 
points). HepB birth dose coverage was higher among children 
living below the poverty level.
Vaccination coverage varied widely by health insurance 
status, with highest coverage (other than for the HepB birth 
dose) among children with private insurance, and lowest 
among uninsured children (Table 2). Compared with children 
who had private insurance, percentage point differences for 
children insured by Medicaid ranged from -2.5 for ≥3 doses of 
poliovirus vaccine and ≥1 dose of varicella to -12.0 for rotavirus 
vaccination, and for uninsured children, ranged from -12.4 
for ≥3 doses of HepB to -24.9 for ≥4 doses of PCV. A higher 
percentage of uninsured children had received no vaccinations 
(3.4%) compared with those insured by Medicaid (0.8%) or 
private insurance (0.6%).
Trends in Vaccination Coverage
Coverage in 2016 was statistically significantly lower than 
in 2015 by 1.3 to 2.3 percentage points for ≥3 doses of DTaP
, 
≥3 doses of poliovirus vaccine, the primary series of Hib, 
≥3 doses of HepB, and ≥3 and ≥4 doses of PCV (Table 1). 
Analysis of trends in coverage by age 2 years, by month and year 
of birth (3), indicated that coverage among children included 
in combined data from the 2015 and 2016 NIS-Child (born 
January 2012 through January 2015) did not change for any 
vaccination. When expanded to children included in the 
2012–2016 NIS-Child (children born January 2009 through 
January 2015), coverage did not change for ≥4 doses of DTaP
, 
≥1 dose of MMR, the full series of Hib, ≥1 dose of varicella, 
and ≥4 doses of PCV (Figure). Coverage over 12 consecutive 
birth months declined by 0.3 percentage points for ≥3 doses 
of poliovirus vaccine and increased for ≥3 doses of HepB (0.6 
percentage points) and ≥2 doses of HepA (1.7 percentage 
points). Rotavirus vaccination coverage by age 19 months also 
increased by 1.4 percentage points per 12 birth months. No 
differences in 2015 and 2016 survey respondent characteristics, 
changes in survey operations, or errors in processing of survey 
data were identified.
Discussion
Coverage with recommended vaccines for children aged 
19–35 months continues to be high and stable but remains

below 90% for vaccines that require booster doses during the 
second year of life (≥4 doses of DTaP and PCV as well as Hib 
full series) and for other recommended vaccines (HepB birth 
dose, rotavirus, and HepA). Disparities in coverage persisted 
for black children and those living below the poverty level, and 
coverage was generally lower for children who were uninsured 
or covered by Medicaid than among those with private insur-
ance. These disparities indicate that improvements are needed 
in access to and delivery of age-appropriate immunization to 
all children, regardless of insurance or financial status (i.e., “the 
immunization safety net”).
Health insurance and poverty status are interrelated factors 
associated with lower vaccination coverage in young children. 
Compared with children who had only private insurance, those 
with Medicaid had lower coverage, and those who were unin-
sured had much lower coverage, for most vaccines. Uninsured 
children, who account for 3.0% of the 2016 NIS-Child 
weighted sample, are eligible for the VFC program, which 
was designed to increase access to vaccination among children 
through age 18 years who might not otherwise be vaccinated 
because of inability to pay. Some families might not be aware 
of the VFC program, be unable to afford fees associated with 
visits to a vaccine provider, or might need assistance locating 
a physician who participates in the VFC program. Children 
living below poverty and up to a certain percentage above 
the poverty level are eligible for Medicaid (42.5% of 2016 
NIS-Child population met the minimum Medicaid eligibility 
level of 138%) and are entitled to VFC vaccines. Barriers to 
health care access and use among the publicly insured include 
language barriers, lack of trust in providers, transportation 
problems, inconvenient office hours, and other provider- and 
system-level factors (4). Medicaid patients also tend to expe-
rience more breaks in insurance coverage than do privately 
insured children, and discontinuities in insurance coverage 
have been associated with lower vaccination coverage (5).

not necessarily at the time of recommended vaccination, with 
enrollment in insurance sometimes occurring after the time 
window for receipt of certain vaccines. CDC has undertaken 
a number of activities designed to elucidate potential barriers 
to early childhood vaccination from the perspective of the state 
immunization programs and health care providers enrolled 
in the VFC program. There are also plans to assess parental 
experience with and barriers to accessing vaccination services.
Lower vaccination coverage among black children than 
among white children has been explained by differences in 
poverty status in past years (6), but in 2016, racial disparities 
were found among children living at or above the poverty level 
for some vaccines. This might reflect incomplete control for 
poverty status, because black children living above poverty 
could still live in lower income households, on average, than 
do white children. In the 2016 NIS-Child, the proportion of 
white children living in households with an income to poverty 
ratio of ≥4 was twice that of black children.
During routine checks for accuracy of the 2016 NIS-Child 
data, statistically significant differences were observed in vac-
cination coverage by age 19 months estimated from the 2016 
compared with the 2015 surveys, among birth cohorts eligible 
to be included in both survey years (3,7). These differences were 
observed for 9 of the 15 vaccine doses evaluated and might 
indicate a systematic change in bias of the survey from 2015 
to 2016. However, no differences were found in survey respon-
dent characteristics and survey operations, and no errors were 
identified in processing of survey data; thus, it is possible that 
these differences might be attributable to random variation.
The observed vaccination coverage differences among birth 
cohorts eligible for both survey years contributed to drops 
in annual estimates of vaccination coverage using the entire 
sample of survey respondents from 2015 to 2016, but do not 
provide evidence for change in vaccination coverage over time 
(3). When trends were assessed more directly by month and 
year of birth from January 2012 through January 2015 (3), 
coverage by age 2 years was stable for all vaccines. When trends

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Vaccination is an effective method for reducing the impact of 
many diseases among young children in the United States. For 
over 20 years, the National Immunization Survey-Child has 
gathered data on children aged 19–35 months to assess 
coverage with the vaccines recommended by the Advisory 
Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).
What is added by this report?
Coverage with most recommended vaccines remained stable 
and high in 2016; coverage was ≥90% for polio, measles, 
mumps, and rubella, varicella, and hepatitis B vaccines, and 
lowest (61%–74%) for hepatitis A, the birth dose of hepatitis B, 
and rotavirus vaccines, and the combined 7-vaccine series. For 
most vaccines, coverage was lower among black children, 
children living below the federal poverty level, and children 
who were uninsured or covered by Medicaid compared with 
white children, children living at or above the federal poverty 
level, and children with private insurance.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Continued collaboration between CDC and state immunization 
programs to further elucidate and address disparities in 
coverage by poverty status should provide valuable information 
while strategies needed for improving access to and delivery of 
age-appropriate immunization are identified. Health care 
providers can increase vaccination coverage using evidence-
based strategies such as provider reminders, standing orders to 
provide vaccination whenever appropriate, and immunization 
information systems.
were assessed over a longer range of births, from January 2009 
through January 2015, coverage was stable for most vaccines; 
for other vaccines, estimated change over twelve monthly birth 
cohorts was within one percentage point, and increased by 1–2 
percentage points for rotavirus vaccination and ≥2 doses of 
HepA. Further evaluations of methods for assessing trends in 
survey accuracy and vaccination coverage using NIS-Child data 
are needed. Improved data quality of immunization informa-
tion systems (IIS) will facilitate their use as another data source 
for population-based coverage assessment (8).
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita-
tions that have been previously described, including exclusion 
of households without telephones, nonresponse bias, and 
incomplete vaccination histories reported by providers (6). 
Total survey error has been evaluated in a sensitivity analysis 
accounting for these errors. Analyses of 2012 and 2013 data 
revealed that NIS-Child might have underestimated true 
vaccination coverage in those years by ≤4 percentage points 
for MMR, ≤5 percentage points for ≥4 doses of DTaP
, and 5 
percentage points for a 6-vaccine series that excluded PCV 
(9,10). Changes in annual vaccination coverage estimates 
should be interpreted with caution (3), particularly when they 
are smaller than the survey margin of error.
These data indicate that the immunization safety net is not 
reaching all children early in life. Coverage could be increased 
with implementation of evidence-based interventions, such 
as provider reminders to eliminate missed opportunities to 
vaccinate, standing orders to provide vaccination whenever 
appropriate, and use of IIS to track vaccination administra-
tion.*** In addition to maintaining the strong U.S. immuni-
zation program, innovative approaches are needed to identify 
children not reached by the current safety net, including using 
local level IIS data. Continued vaccination coverage assessment 
using the NIS-Child will guide efforts to improve vaccination 
coverage. Data completeness and functionality of IIS have 
improved in recent years (8); however, additional progress is 
needed to maximize IIS utility for vaccination coverage assess-
ments at state and local levels.
