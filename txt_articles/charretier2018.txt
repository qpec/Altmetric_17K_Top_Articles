Abstract 
The classical cell-culture methods, such as cell culture infectious dose 50% (CCID50) assays, 
are time-consuming, end-point assays currently used during the development of a viral 
vaccine production process to measure viral infectious titers. However, they are not suitable 
for handling the large number of tests required for high-throughput and large-scale screening 
analyses. Impedance-based bio-sensing techniques used in real-time cell analysis (RTCA) to 
assess cell layer biological status in vitro, provide real-time data. In this proof-of-concept 
study, we assessed the correlation between the results from CCID50 and RTCA assays and 
compared time and costs using monovalent and tetravalent chimeric yellow fever dengue 
(CYD) vaccine strains. For the RTCA assay, Vero cells were infected with the CYD sample 
and real-time impedance was recorded, using the dimensionless cell index (CI). The CI 
peaked just after infection and decreased as the viral cytopathic effect occurred in a dose-
dependent manner. The time to the median CI (CITmed) was correlated with viral titers 
determined by CCID50 over a range of about 4-5 log10 CCID50/ml. This in-house RTCA virus-
titration assay was shown to be a robust method for determining real-time viral infectious 
titers, and could be an alternative to the classical CCID50 assay during the development of 
viral vaccine production process.

1. Introduction 
Micro-scale, high-throughput bioreactor technology is increasingly being used to optimize 
parameters during virus production process development for vaccine manufacturing 
(Bareither and Pollard, 2011; Janakiraman et al., 2015). However, the assessment of the 
optimization relies on classical cell-based end-point assays to measure infectious titers such as 
cell culture infectious dose 50% (CCID50) and plaque forming unit (PFU) assays, which are 
labor-intensive, expensive and time consuming. In addition, viral infection is sometimes only 
visible after indirect immune-detection of the endpoint so that ‘real-time’ data are not 
available (Hsiung, 1984; Pierson and Diamond, 2007). These classical techniques need to be 
adapted for vaccine production process development as they are not suitable for the large 
number of tests required for the high-throughput and large-scale screening technologies used 
and the short time-frame requirements (Bareither and Pollard, 2011). 
Real-time cell analysis (RTCA) systems can be used to measure electrical impedance-
based signals that can provide information on the in vitro cell layer biological status. 
Impedance-based bio-sensing techniques give qualitative and quantitative information on the 
cells, including cell number, their adhesion and spreading, as well as cell morphology and 
viability, in a label-free system (Atienza et al., 2006; Giaever and Keese, 1991; Solly et al., 
2004). Changes in cellular morphology and/or growth rate, referred to as cytopathic effects 
(CPEs), are early indicators of viral infection and the quantification of these events by 
measuring impedance can be used to follow and characterize viral growth kinetics (Cheung, 
Leung, and Peiris, 2011; Drew et al., 2010; Ebersohn, Coetzee, and Venter, 2014; Fang et al., 
2011; Golke et al., 2012; Marlina et al., 2015; Sharma et al., 2011; Teng et al., 2013; 
Witkowski et al., 2010). The changes in the cell layer impedance are measured using a 
dimensionless parameter, the cell index (CI). Impedance increases as cells adhere to and 
spread on the bottom of the well resulting in an increased CI. As cells die or become rounded

or detached, for example due to viral infection, the impedance and, therefore, the CI decreases 
(Atienza et al., 2006; Fang et al., 2011; Tian et al., 2012; Xing et al., 2005). 
A vaccine that protects against four dengue serotypes (DENV-1-4) has been developed by 
Sanofi Pasteur using a live-attenuated vaccine strain of yellow fever (YF), 17D, as the 
backbone for a chimeric YF DEN (CYD) vaccine (Guy et al., 2011; Guy et al., 2016). Genes 
in the YF 17D genome encoding the pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins have 
been replaced with genes from each of the four DENV serotypes in the vaccine strains to 
produce four chimeric vaccine strains (CYD1-4) which are mixed to produce the recombinant 
dengue tetravalent vaccine. 
As part of the process of evaluating our in-house RTCA virus titration assay as an 
alternative to CCID50 method during vaccine viral production process development, we 
performed a proof-of-concept study. The objectives of this study were to assess the 
correlation between the results from our in-house RTCA virus titration assay and CCID50 
method, to investigate the robustness of the RTCA system using the CYD vaccine strains as 
test vaccine viruses and to compare the time and costs associated with both methods. 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1 Cells and virus  
Vero cells (ATCC® reference CCL-81™), from African Green Monkey, were cultured in 
175cm² flasks at +36±2°C in minimum essential media (MEM; Gibco®), supplemented with 
5% fetal calf serum (FCS; Hyclone®), 2mM L-glutamine (Gibco), 22 mM sodium bicarbonate 
(Eurobio®) and penicillin-dihydrostreptomycin (200 U/mL and 50 mg/L, respectively; 
Eurobio). Using supplemented MEM, the cells were amplified twice a week between passages 
142 and 150 and the cells were counted with a Neubauer hemocytometer after staining with 
erythrosine. The Vero cells were used for both the CCID50 assays and for RTCA system 
method development.

A total of 135 samples of the four CYD strains were collected at different steps of the 
production cultures (viral growth kinetics at different time points, from viral inoculation to 
final harvest) using serum-free Vero cells and micro-carriers in bioreactors and titrated with 
the RTCA and CCID50 methods.  
2.2. Virus titration by cell culture infectious dose 50% assay (CCID50) 
Infectious CYD viruses were quantified by endpoint dilution titration on Vero cells and the 
results were expressed as log10 CCID50/mL. Based on a theoretical infectious titer, serial 10-
fold dilutions followed by serial 4-fold dilutions of the viral sample were made in MEM 
supplemented with 10% FCS and 2% N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine N'-2-ethane sulfonic acid 
(HEPES). Vero cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 3.104 cells/well in MEM 
supplemented with 10% FCS. The Vero cells were infected on the day of seeding with eight 
viral dilutions. After 7-days incubation at +36±2°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere and under 
relative humidity, the plates were fixed with 85% acetone at -20°C. To prepare immune-
detection, cell layers were then permeabilized and saturated. Viral proteins were detected by 
incubation with in-house, serotype-specific, anti-DENV mouse monoclonal antibodies for 
45 min at +36±2°C. After rinsing the wells with PBS-Tween buffer, a goat anti-mouse 
antibody labeled with alkaline phosphatase (IgG-AP, Southern Biotechnology Associates®) 
was added and the plate incubated for 45 min at +36±2°C. The wells were rinsed with PBS-
Tween buffer and 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (BCIP/NBT) 
substrate solution was added (Sigma®; BCIP (0.15 mg/mL), NBT (0.30 mg/mL), Tris buffer 
(100 mM) and MgCl2 (5 mM), pH 9.25–9.75). The plates were then incubated for 60 to 90 
minutes in the dark at room temperature and rinsed with water. In the presence of IgG-AP, 
BCIP/NBT reacted to give an insoluble black end product. The black-colored wells were 
counted and the virus concentration was determined using the least-squares statistical method.

2.3. Virus titration by real-time cell analysis system 
The RTCA system (xCELLigence™, ACEA Biosciences Inc, San Diego, CA) measures 
electronic impedance in 96-well E-plates that have microelectrode arrays integrated in the 
bottom of each well (Atienza et al., 2006; Ke et al., 2011; Solly et al., 2004). An impedance 
analyzer and computer outside the incubator, connected to a workstation, were used to take 
impedance readings every 15 minutes to monitor the real-time status of the cells during 
incubation. 
First, 150 µL of MEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 2mM L-glutamine, 22mM sodium 
bicarbonate and penicillin-dihydrostreptomycin (200 U/mL and 50 mg/L, respectively) was 
added to the E-plate wells which was loaded into the workstation to record the background 
impedance. Then 50 µL of a Vero cell suspension (400,000 cells/mL) in the same culture 
medium was added to each well and the E-plate loaded into the workstation which was placed 
in an incubator at +36±2°C, 5% CO2 atmosphere, under relative humidity.  
2.3.1 Monovalent CYD vaccine virus titration 
The following day, 11 serial, 4-fold dilutions of each CYD serotype standard were 
prepared (concentrations ranging between 2 and 9 log10 CCID50/mL depending on the 
serotype) in MEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 2mM L-glutamine, 22mM sodium 
bicarbonate and penicillin-dihydrostreptomycin (200 U/mL and 50 mg/L, respectively) and 
20 mM HEPES. The resulting standard curve was used as a reference in each plate to 
determine the equivalent CCID50 titer for the tested samples. These dilutions were distributed 
in duplicate and ten-fold serial dilutions of samples to be tested were distributed in triplicate 
in the 96-well E-plate (Figure 1). Triplicate dilutions of an internal control, a homologous 
CYD vaccine virus with a known infectious titer (different from that used for the standard 
curve), were added to well H10 to H12. The titer of the internal control was plotted on a 
control chart to assess the overall inter-assay performance. The E-plate was removed from the

workstation, 100 µL medium was removed from each well and replaced by 100 µL of the 
standard or samples dilutions. To measure the background signal, ≥1 well/plate contained 
only supplemented MEM and ≥1 well/plate contained only Vero cells to measure impedance 
for an uninfected cell control (Figure 1). Impedance was measured every 15 minutes for 
7 days after reloading the plate into the incubator. In parallel, time-lapse images were 
captured (every 60 minutes at 10X magnification) using a JuLI™ Stage automated imaging 
system (NanoEntek Inc., Seoul, Korea) from the initiation of viral infection until the end of 
incubation and a video was generated using JuLI™ Stage software in a classical 96-well plate 
(without the microelectrode arrays), prepared and seeded in an identical manner. 
2.3.2 Tetravalent CYD vaccine virus titration  
Prior to titration of one serotype in the tetravalent vaccine virus mix, three of the four 
serotypes were neutralized using in-house serotype-specific anti-DENV mouse monoclonal 
antibodies. The non-neutralized serotype could then be measured as described above. In the 
same plate, a non-neutralized dilution of the tetravalent vaccine virus mix was added to three 
wells. 
2.4. Assessment of the correlation between RTCA and CCID50 assay results 
The CI was derived using differences in impedance measured in infected and non-infected 
wells (Figure 1). The maximum (CImax) and minimum (CImin) CI post-infection measurements 
were used to calculate the median CI (CImed) and the time to achieve CImed (CITmed). The 
CITmed for each dilution was plotted against its concentration given by the CCID50 assay. The 
linearity of the curve was assessed from 8 repeated titrations of the CYD2 dengue vaccine 
virus samples diluted to give 11 points containing between 2.4 and 8.4 log10 CCID50/mL, 
performed by different operators on different days. The interactions between the theoretical 
concentrations and the different series were analyzing to assess parallelism between assays. 
The correlation between CCID50 concentration and RTCA CITmed was verified using a non-

weighted linear regression analysis and the least squares method. Finally, the linearity of the 
model was estimated by the analysis of R2 and its residues. 
A total of 135 samples from the CYD2 production process development were titrated using 
both the RTCA and CCID50 assays. The samples were diluted from 1/10 to 1/10 000, 
depending on the process stage, so that the expected viral concentration would be in the linear 
part of the standard curve.  
2.6. Robustness study of virus titration by RTCA 
The effects of the following parameters on the RTCA assay performance were evaluated: 
 Number of cells/well: from 10,000 to 40,000 
 Delay between cell seeding and CYD infection: from D0 to D3 
 Age of cells (number of passages): low (n=142) or high (n=155). 
 Cell media: MEM-L-glutamine, MEM-GlutaMAX (Gibco) and Dulbecco's Modified 
Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Gibco) 
These assays were performed using several concentration of a standard CYD vaccine virus.  
3. Results  
Development of this viral titration RTCA assay involved the optimization of conditions for 
Vero cell culture and CYD monovalent infection. First, a time parameter describing the 
decline of virus-induced impedance after infection was defined, i.e. the time to reach the 
median CI (CITmed). Statistical analysis was used to demonstrate the relation between RTCA 
and CCID50 virus titration methods and the robustness was assessed to identify what 
parameters affected the RTCA sensitivity. The RTCA assay was finally used to titrate one 
serotype in a mixture of all four serotypes by neutralizing three of the serotypes. Additionally, 
the industrial time and cost advantages of this alternative titration method were evaluated.

3.1. Estimation of CITmed for monovalent CYD vaccine virus standard dilutions 
The CITmed was estimated for the CYD vaccine virus standard dilutions. After seeding, the CI 
increased as the Vero cells adhere and spread on the well bottom. Following cell infection, the 
CI increased to a second peak, CImax (Figure 2). As the virus infected the cells, the CI 
declined until a minimum value, CImin, was reached while there was only a slight variation of 
the CI in uninfected cells during the assay. The time-lapse video of the cell infection showed 
the correlation between the CI decrease and virus-induced cell morphological modifications 
and cell death (see Supplementary File). In Figure 2, the time-lapse pictures corresponding to 
the cell layer at D1, just before infection, and at D2, D4, D5 and D7 show the cytopathic 
effect due to the viral infection on the cell morphology and cell death. If followed for longer, 
the CI increased after the CImin as surviving cells started to grow (Figure 2), as seen in the 
time-lapse video (see Supplementary File). The CI decline was faster with higher 
concentrations of virus showing a virus dose-response (Figure 3A). CITmed was used to 
qualify the virus-induced kinetic profile for a single CYD serotype (see §2.4), since the CI 
curves did not reach zero. 
3.2. Correlation between CYD virus log10 CCID50/mL and CITmed 
The correlation between the CITmed, determined as above, and the log10 CCID50/mL was then 
determined. The CITmed was found to be correlated with the viral concentration (Figure 3B for 
CYD2). The slope of the curve for CITmed and log10 CCID50/mL for CYD2 was significantly 
different from 0 (p<0.0001) indicating a linear correlation between the two values.  
For CYD2, the linearity of the model was estimated by the analysis of R2 and its residues 
which are the difference between experimental data and data estimated with the model. The 
determination of the coefficient value (R2 = 0.98) and residues demonstrated that the 
relationship between log10 CCID50/mL and CITmed was linear. For the four CYD serotypes, a 
linear relationship was observed for concentrations over a range of about 4 to 5 log10

CCID50/ml, depending on the serotype (Table 1) and this was also confirmed by statistical 
analysis (data not shown). 
Comparisons of the concentrations obtained with RTCA and CCID50 were made using 135 
samples of the CYD2 dengue vaccine virus performed by different technicians over eight 
months (Figure 3C). Since the variability for the reference CCID50 assay was about ±0.3 log10 
CCID50/mL, it was decided that the absolute difference between the titers obtained by the two 
methods should not be more than this total range of variability, i.e. 0.6 log10 CCID50/mL. 
The CITmed for each of the CYD2 dengue vaccine virus standard dilutions were plotted 
separately against the concentration determined using the CCID50 assay (Figure 3B). The 
absolute difference between the extrapolated CCID50 titers using the CITmed and the CCID50 
titers obtained with the classical assay was below the threshold that had been defined as 
acceptable, i.e. ≤0.6 log10 CCID50/mL, for 130 of the 135 samples (96%) (Figure 3C). A linear 
relationship was observed between the CCID50 titers and the CITmed titers with an equation of 
y = 1.0087x – 0.0182 and R² = 0.9034 (Figure 3C). 
3.3. Robustness study of virus titration by RTCA 
To assess the robustness of the RTCA titration we evaluated the impact of varying different 
assay parameters on the results to define the method limits. The CI profile was found to be 
sensitive to the number of cells seeded, number of cell passages (age), time between cell 
seeding and viral infection and type of culture medium (Figure 4A and 4B). In MEM/L-
glutamine medium, the CI decrease was more pronounced than in DMEM or MEM-
GlutaMAX media which confirmed the selection of this culture medium condition. When the 
cells were infected 24 hours after seeding rather than on D0, the CI decrease was greater and 
occurred more rapidly (Figure 4A).  
A standard curve using the same virus serotype was included in each E-plate used to 
determine the viral titer of unknown samples to take into consideration the effect of the any

inter-assay variations on the CITmed (Figure 1). A single dilution of a sample of a homologous 
serotype, with a known titer, was included in each plate, as an internal control to monitor the 
sensitivity of the RTCA device. The titer was plotted on a control chart after each assay. The 
results for each plate were considered validated if the titer of the internal control was within 
three standard deviations of the mean value on the control chart. 
3.4. Tetravalent CYD vaccine virus titration by RTCA 
Since the RTCA assay is not serotype-specific, we assessed the performance of the assay for 
CYD2 titration with and without neutralization of the other three CYD vaccine viruses using 
serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies in a preparation containing all four serotypes (Figure 
5). The results showed that the CITmed for the tested serotype occurred later in samples after 
neutralization of the other three serotypes. Under these conditions, the differences between 
the infectious titers measured by RTCA in the neutralized tetravalent mixture and those from 
the CCID50 assays were within the defined acceptable limits (i.e. ≤0.6 log10 CCID50/mL), 
ranging from 0 log10 CCID50/mL to 0.4 log10 CCID50/mL therefore providing proof of concept 
that RTCA can be used to titrate a single serotype in a multivalent sample. 
3.5. Comparison of time and costs for CCID50 and RTCA assays for CYD titration 
The analysis of the time and costs, using values relative to our industrial setting, for material 
and reagents needed for the CCID50 and RTCA assays (average for 23 titrations, i.e. one E-
plate for the RTCA assay vs. 72 plates for the CCID50 assay) showed that, for the same 
number of CYD samples, the RTCA titration assay was 5-times less labor-intense (operator 
time) and cost 3.5-times less (including operator time, reagents, consumables), compared with 
the CCID50 assay. The results from the CCID50 assay are only available after the cells have 
been labeled using an immuno-detection method, whereas real-time results are available with 
the RTCA assay. The flexibility of the RTCA assay, compared with the CCID50 assay, is an 
important factor when considering programming the titrations.

4. Discussion 
During the development of viral vaccine production processes, the determination of viral 
infectious titers provides essential data for monitoring the impact of various parameters 
modifications during the process. The current cell-based methods for measuring the infectious 
titer, such as CCID50 and PFU assays, are time-consuming endpoint assays during which cells 
are observed after a defined culture period (Hsiung, 1984; Pierson and Diamond, 2007). The 
development of vaccine production processes are now based on high-throughput cell culture 
bioreactor technologies, therefore alternative high throughput infectious titration methods that 
can provide results more rapidly have been investigated (Bareither and Pollard, 2011; 
Janakiraman et al., 2015).  
The results from this proof-of-concept study show that RTCA titration assays can be 
considered as an alternative to the CCID50 assay for the titration of virus during the 
development of the production process. Since the variability of the results from the CCID50 
assay is generally given as ± 0.3 log10 CCID50/mL, we decided that an acceptable absolute 
difference between the titers obtained with the RTCA assay, compared with those obtained 
with the CCID50 assay methods would be the same as this range of variability, i.e. ≤0.6 log10 
CCID50/mL. We found that 96% of titers determined with the RTCA assay were within this 
difference limit (Figure 3C). 
The RTCA assay is based on the measurement of electronic impedance using a 
microelectrode array situated in the bottom of a culture well (Solly et al., 2004). Changes in 
impedance are detected as cells adhere to the well surface, and as they spread and become 
confluent (Atienza et al., 2006; Giaever and Keese, 1991). The system has been used in a 
wide range of areas, including drug development, toxicology, oncology, medical 
microbiology and virology (AbuBakar et al., 2014; Al-Ahmad et al., 2013; Cheung et al., 
2011; Drew et al., 2010; Ebersohn et al., 2014; El-Andaloussi et al., 2012; Fender et al., 2012;

Golke et al., 2012; Kho et al., 2015; Li et al., 2013; Limame et al., 2012; Marlina et al., 2015; 
Prasad et al., 2014; Ryder et al., 2010; Sharma et al., 2011; Solly et al., 2004; Teng et al., 
2013; Wang et al., 2013; Witkowski et al., 2010). For example, an RTCA assay has been used 
to quantitatively monitor virus-induced CPE for West Nile virus (WNV) and St Louis 
encephalitis virus (SLEV) in Vero cells (Fang et al., 2011). The CPE kinetics were reported to 
show a consistent and reproducible dose-related pattern over a concentration range of about 4 
to 5 log10 CCID50/ml for WNV and SLEV viruses. The onset and timing of the CPE kinetics, 
as seen by the CI values, were earlier and faster for WNV than for SLEV, although they 
belong to the same sero-complex of Flaviviridae. This observation is consistent with their 
relative cytolytic activity, since West Nile viruses are more virulent. We defined the CITmed 
parameter that takes into account the specific CI kinetic profiles of CYD, and that was 
statistically correlated with viral infectious titer which enabled us to develop an alternative 
infectivity titration assay. The CIT50 used by other research teams is not suitable for the CYD 
CI kinetic profile since the CI does not reach zero. Culture conditions were selected to obtain 
a clear CI profile that enabled the CITmed to be easily determined on the CI curves. The 
optimal delay between cell seeding and infection for CYD was 24 hours, when the cell layer 
was subconfluent instead of simultaneous cell-seeding and infection, similar to that reported 
for influenza virus, WNV and SLEV (Figure 4A) (Fang et al., 2011; Tian et al., 2012). It is 
clear that the infection conditions (delay between cell seeding and infection, culture media, 
cell density) must be adapted for each virus and cell type combinations to optimize the RTCA 
monitoring. An RTCA assay was developed to assess the CPE kinetics of the 2009 influenza 
A/H1N1 strain and the efficacy of neutralizing antibodies in human sera using MDCK cells 
(Tian et al., 2012). The CPE kinetics were found to be time- and viral-load-dependent over a 
5 log10 concentration range and were also found to be specific for different H1N1 strains.

two studies were found to correlate well with those obtained using the standard assays (Fang 
et al., 2011; Tian et al., 2012). 
Despite the RTCA assay being highly sensitive to experimental conditions, the design of this 
in-house RTCA virus titration assay resulted in a robust method to determine infectious titers 
in log10 CCID50/mL with low variability. The variability between experiments was assessed 
by including a dilution series of a homologous virus standard sample with a known infectious 
titer in each 96-well E-plate. The results obtained for this standard sample have been used to 
construct a standard curve as an internal control for each E-plate, thus used to assess any 
inter-experiment variations.  
Compared with the standard CCID50 assay, the RTCA is about 5 times less labor-intense and 
3.5 times cheaper, in our industrial setting. Although the RTCA assay is not serotype-specific, 
our results showed that it is possible to titrate one specific CYD serotype in a mix containing 
four serotypes, by pre-neutralization of the viral mix with antibodies against the other three 
serotypes. However, it is important to have serotype-specific antibodies with no cross-reaction 
that can effectively neutralize the viral strains, so that only one of the strains in the mix can 
infect the cells. To facilitate future use of the RTCA assay, automation of the whole assay 
process with a dedicated robot for sample dilution and distribution could allow more than 250 
samples to be titrated per week compared with 60 samples per week with the CCID50 assay in 
the current industrial setting. However, increasing the number of samples will also require 
automatic data analysis, since the RTCA assay generates a huge amount of data, which needs 
to be treated rapidly to fully benefit from its advantages. 
5. Conclusions  
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a RTCA assay has been evaluated for 
the titration of monovalent and tetravalent CYD vaccine virus samples. The RTCA assay 
could be used in the determination of the infectious titer of many viruses on adherent cell

Figure 3: Correlation between classical CCID50 and RTCA virus titration assay: A) 
Evaluation of the linear range for CYD2 on Vero cells (20,000 cells/well), after infection 24 
hours (arrow) after seeding the cells. The CYD2 concentrations assessed ranged from 3.1 to 
8.5 log10 CCID50/mL. B) Linearity between the infectious titer determined using CCID50, 
expressed as log10 CCID50 and CITmed determined using the RTCA for CYD4 was assessed by 
plotting the viral infectious titer on the x-axis and the CITmed on the y-axis. C) Comparison of 
concentrations obtained with RTCA and CCID50 was assessed using 135 samples of the 
CYD2 dengue vaccine virus performed by different technicians over eight months. A total of 
114 values are plotted on the graph; the remaining 21 values were below the detection 
threshold for both assays (showing correlation between the assays). The viral infectious titer 
determined by RTCA for each of the CYD2 dengue vaccine virus standard dilutions were 
plotted against the concentration determined for the same sample dilution using the CCID50 
assay. The absolute difference between the extrapolated CCID50 titers using the CITmed and 
actual CCID50 titers obtained with the classical assay was below the threshold that had been 
defined as acceptable, i.e. ≤0.6 log10 CCID50/mL (dotted lines), for 130 of the 135 samples 
(96%); the five samples that did not meet this threshold are shown in red.
