Bcl-3 is an atypical NF-kB family member that regulates NF-kB-dependent gene expression in
effector T cells, but a cell-intrinsic function in regulatory T (Treg) cells and colitis is not clear.
Here we show that Bcl-3 expression levels in colonic T cells correlate with disease
manifestation in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Mice with T-cell-specific
overexpression of Bcl-3 develop severe colitis that can be attributed to defective Treg
cell development and function, leading to the infiltration of immune cells such as
pro-inflammatory gdT cells, but not ab T cells. In Treg cells, Bcl-3 associates directly with
NF-kB p50 to inhibit DNA binding of p50/p50 and p50/p65 NF-kB dimers, thereby
regulating NF-kB-mediated gene expression. This study thus reveals intrinsic functions of
Bcl-3 in Treg cells, identifies Bcl-3 as a potential prognostic marker for colitis and illustrates
the mechanism by which Bcl-3 regulates NF-kB activity in Tregs to prevent colitis.

 T
he mucosal immune system of the gastrointestinal tract
mediates immune protection against foreign pathogens
and simultaneously conveys tolerance to microbes in the
gut.
Failure
to
tolerate
microbial
antigens
can
result
in
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn’s
disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The pathological process
of both CD and UC involves cycles of inflammation, ulceration
and subsequent regeneration of the intestinal mucosa1. CD is
classically considered as a TH1-mediated disease, due to the
predominance of interferon-g (IFN-g)-producing CD4 þ T cells
in the mucosa2, whereas UC is characterized by infiltrating
TH2 cells and the production of interleukin (IL)-5 (ref. 3). gd T
cells, which can secrete high levels of the pro-inflammatory
cytokine IL-17A in the gut4, have important functions in
the pathogenesis of IBD5–7.
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are essential for the maintenance of
gut immune homeostasis, owing to their function as suppressors
of cytokine production in TH1 and TH2 cells4,8,9. Moreover, Treg
cells are important mediators of tolerance in the intestine and
various studies have linked defects in Treg cell development or
function to the onset of IBD10,11. Even though the contribution of
Treg cells in the prevention of IBD is well-appreciated, the
molecular factors regulating the functionality of Treg cells during
IBD are still not entirely characterized.
The nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) transcription factor family is
composed of five members: RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, p50
(NF-kB1) and p52 (NF-kB2). These factors have been implicated
in the development and function of natural Treg (nTreg) cells,
which develop in the thymus, as well as inducible Treg (iTreg)
cells, which are derived from naive CD4 þ T cells after antigenic
stimulation in peripheral tissues such as the gut12–15. Indeed,
mice lacking NF-kB members such as p50, c-Rel and p65 have
impaired Treg cell development15–17. Furthermore, in mice with
T-cell-specific transgenic expression of an inhibitors of kB (IkB)
super-repressor,
the
number
of
CD4 þFoxp3 þ
Treg
cells
correlates with NF-kB activity14. Nevertheless, although mice
lacking
p50,
c-Rel
and
p65
have
defective
Treg
cell
development15–17, only mice lacking p65 develop signs of
autoimmunity17, leaving an open question as to how NF-kB
activity
modulates
Treg
cell
functionality
to
prevent
the
development of autoimmunity.
NF-kB activity is regulated by members of the classical IkB
protein family, including IkBa, IkBb and IkBe, as well as
p105/NF-kB1 and p100/NF-kB2 precursors, whereas the atypical
IkB proteins, including IkBz, IkBNS and Bcl-3 (ref. 18),
bind directly to NF-kB members in the nucleus and modulate
NF-kB-mediated gene expression. Bcl-3, originally identified as a
proto-oncogene in a subgroup of B-cell leukaemia, enters the
nucleus and associates selectively with DNA-bound NF-kB p50
or
p52
homodimers
to
regulate
NF-kB-dependent
gene
transcription. Bcl-3 was shown to enhance NF-kB-mediated
transactivation by acting as a coactivator for p50 and p52 dimers.
Further studies have shown that Bcl-3 is also able to inhibit NF-
kB-mediated transactivation by binding to p50 homodimers. The
mode of Bcl-3 action, whether inhibitory or activating, further
depends
on
the
cell
type
investigated19–24.
Studies
using
Bcl-3-deficient mice underline the importance of Bcl-3 in
effective adaptive and innate immune responses against patho-
gens, in central tolerance and the prevention of autoimmune
diseases, as well as in effector T-cell plasticity25–27. Moreover,
Bcl-3 regulates intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and was
shown to be essential for the induction of dextran sulfate sodium-
induced colitis28,29. Although these studies indicate a possible
involvement of Bcl-3 in the regulation of effector T cells and gut
immune homeostasis, the exact functions of Bcl-3 in Treg cells
and IBD have not been reported.
In this study, we demonstrate that Bcl-3 is important for the
maintenance of Treg cell function and the prevention of
spontaneous colitis. Patient data show that Bcl-3 expression
levels correlate with disease severity. In line with this, mice that
overexpress Bcl-3 in T cells develop severe spontaneous colitis,
which is not mediated by effector T cells but instead is caused by
impaired Treg cell function resulting from altered NF-kB activity
via cell-intrinsic regulation by Bcl-3. In Treg cells, Bcl-3 interacts
with p50 and inhibits p50 DNA binding, and thereby alters the
NF-kB-mediated genetic programmes that are required for Treg
cell development and function. Thus, our study highlights the
necessity to monitor Bcl-3 expression in both CD and UC, and
implicates Bcl-3 as a potential therapeutic target in IBD.
Results
Bcl-3 expression levels are increased in patients with IBD. To
study a potential role of Bcl-3 in the pathogenesis of human IBD,
we used immunohistochemistry to examine Bcl-3 expression
levels in colons of patients suffering from either CD or UC. This
staining revealed that CD and UC patients had massive infiltra-
tion of Bcl-3 þ cells in the lamina propria (LP), whereas control
groups displayed only few Bcl-3 expressing cells within this area
(Fig. 1a). Accordingly, quantitative reverse transcriptase–PCR
(RT–PCR) analysis using RNA isolated from colons of patients
with active CD or UC showed significantly increased levels of
Bcl-3 expression compared with controls (Fig. 1b). To investigate
specifically which cells express Bcl-3, immunohistochemistry
from colon cross-sections of patients with CD and UC was per-
formed. This analysis revealed increased numbers of CD4 þ
T cells in the inflamed colon of both CD, as well as UC patients
compared with healthy patients (Fig. 1c). Indeed, we could show
that in most regions, the majority of infiltrating CD4 þ T cells
was positive for Bcl-3 expression (Fig. 1c). Furthermore, we
isolated LP T cells from UC and control patients and analysed the
expression of Bcl-3 by western blotting. We observed that patients
with UC expressed increased protein levels of Bcl-3 compared
with control patients (Fig. 1d). Together, these data illustrate
a direct correlation between Bcl-3-expressing CD4 þ T cells and
the pathogenesis of IBD.
Bcl-3TOE mice develop intestinal inflammation. To evaluate the
functional role of increased Bcl-3 expression in T cells in the
pathogenesis of IBD, we used a mouse model in which Bcl-3 and
enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) are expressed upon
Cre-mediated recombination of a loxP flanked transcriptional
STOP cassette30. These mice were crossed to the CD4-Cre mouse
strain
to
obtain
mice,
termed
Bcl-3TOE,
that
specifically
overexpress Bcl-3 in all mature ab T cells including Treg cells.
Western blot analysis of purified CD4 þ T cells of Bcl-3TOE
mice confirmed higher expression of Bcl-3 compared with control
T cells (Fig. 2a). Starting at 8 weeks of age, Bcl-3TOE mice suffered
from severe diarrhoea and rectal prolapse (Fig. 2b, left). As the
development of a rectal prolapse is a predisposition for colonic
inflammation, those mice were examined by mini-endoscopy. We
found that Bcl-3TOE mice spontaneously developed severe
intestinal inflammation, as indicated by a significantly higher
clinical score of colitis (Fig. 2b right and Fig. 2c), with an
incidence of 490%. In addition, macroscopic examination of the
intestine showed severe pancolitis affecting all parts of the colon
distal from the caecum (Fig. 2d). Furthermore, histological
haematoxylin and eosin analysis revealed a dramatic infiltration
of immune cells into the colon of Bcl-3TOE mice (Fig. 2e).
As T-cell-specific Bcl-3 overexpression drives the development of
a strong colonic inflammation similar to the histopathology
observed in patients with IBD, we further characterized the colitis

 phenotype in these mice and examined gene expression of
different pro-inflammatory cytokines. Along with increased levels
of Bcl3 transcript, expression of Il6, Il17a, Tnfa and Ifng were
significantly elevated in the colons of Bcl-3TOE mice compared
with littermate controls (Fig. 2f), whereas expression of Il10 was
unaffected (Fig. 2f). Next, we performed immunohistochemistry
of cellular infiltrates within the mucosa of Bcl-3TOE mice. We
found increased numbers of infiltrating CD4 þ T cells, CD11c þ
dendritic cells, F4/80 þ macrophages and MPO þ neutrophils
compared with littermate controls (Fig. 2g). Quantification of this
analysis revealed a significant increased cell infiltration of all
tested immune cells in the colon of Bcl-3-overexpressing mice,
confirming the increased score of colitis as measured by
mini-endoscopy (Supplementary Fig. 1). These data demon-
strate that increased Bcl-3 expression in T cells leads to severe
intestinal inflammation in mice.
Colitis in Bcl-3TOE mice is not mediated by ab T cells. To
understand how T-cell-specific overexpression of Bcl-3 drives the
initiation of intestinal inflammation, we analysed the effect of
Bcl-3 overexpression on T-cell pathogenicity. Therefore, we used
Bcl-3-overexpressing CD4þ T cells to induce intestinal inflam-
mation using the T cell transfer model of colitis31. However,
transfer of Bcl-3TOE CD4þCD25 � T cells failed to induce colitis
in RAG1 � / � recipients, whereas control CD4þCD25 � T cells
induced colitis as measured by significantly increased clinical scores
of intestinal inflammation (Fig. 3a) and weight loss (Fig. 3b). As
Bcl-3TOE CD4þ T cells failed to mediate colitis, we assessed the
proliferative capacity of these cells, as it was shown that the transfer
of naive T cells into lymphopenic mice initiates their homeostatic
proliferation32. This analysis revealed an impaired proliferative
capacity of Bcl-3-overexpressing CD4 þ T cells compared with
control CD4 þ T cells upon stimulation (Fig. 3c), an impairment
that can explain the failure of these cells to induce transferred
colitis. Previously, it has been demonstrated that Bcl-3 over-
expression promotes T-cell survival33. To evaluate whether this
holds true also in our system, we performed Annexin V and
7-aminoactinomycin D staining of purified CD4þ T cells cultured
for 4 days without stimulation. Indeed, we also found a survival
advantage of Bcl-3-overexpressing CD4þ T cells compared with
control T cells (Supplementary Fig. 2), similar to the data published
by Marck et al.33. To examine whether Bcl-3 has an impact on
T-cell differentiation, we analysed naive versus memory/effector

 T cells in Bcl-3TOE mice. We found a dramatic decrease in the
percentage and total cell numbers of CD44high CD62Llow effector/
memory CD4 þ T cells in lymph nodes (LNs), mesenteric LN
(mLN) and spleens of Bcl-3TOE mice compared with controls,
whereas
accordingly
the
percentage
of
naive
T
cells
was
significantly increased (Fig. 3d,e). This effect we already detected
in young mice at the age of 4 weeks before the onset of colitis
(Supplementary Fig. 3c,d). As proinflammatory cytokines IFN-g,
IL-17A and granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor
have been implicated in playing important roles in the development
and pathogenesis of colitis, we investigated their production by
CD4þ T cells from Bcl-3TOE mice compared with controls.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of CD4þ
T cells isolated from the spleen and LNs revealed a significant
decrease in IL-17A and IFN-g expression by CD4þ T cells from
Bcl-3TOE mice, whereas there was no difference in granulocyte–
macrophage colony-stimulating factor production when compared
with T CD4 þ T cells from littermate controls (Supplementary
Fig. 4a,b). As the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine
IL-10 is known to have an ameliorating effect on colitis, we also
investigated the production of this cytokine by CD4þ T cells. Here,
a significant reduction of IL-10 production by Bcl-3TOE CD4 þ
T cells was found, probably contributing to the observed
colitis phenotype in Bcl-3TOE mice. However, the effector CD4 þ
T cells themselves do not seem to be responsible for the induction
of colitis, as their numbers as well as their production of
the inflammatory cytokines IFN-g and IL-17A are significantly
reduced.
Previously, it was demonstrated that the numbers of activated
gd T cells are increased in the colitic area of CD and
UC patients6,7. Interestingly, we detected an increased number
of gd T cells, in particular CD8a þ gd T cells in the intestinal
epithelial cell (intestinal epithelial lymphocyte, IEL) and LP
lymphocyte (LPL) compartments of Bcl-3TOE mice as assessed
by flow cytometry (Fig. 3f,g and Supplementary Fig. 5) and
immunohistochemistry (Fig. 3h). Thus, gd T cells seem to
represent
a
major
population
involved
in
the
intestinal
inflammatory response of Bcl-3TOE mice.

 Bcl-3 overexpression impairs suppressive capacity of Tregs.
Tregs are essential for the maintenance of immunological
tolerance and immune homeostasis by suppressing the activation
and expansion of potentially self-reactive T cells. We found
a significant reduction in the percentage as well as total numbers
of Foxp3 þ Tregs in LNs and spleens of Bcl-3TOE mice compared
with controls (Fig. 4a,b). This reduction was already present in
Bcl-3TOE mice at the age of 4 weeks compared with littermate
controls (Supplementary Fig. 3e,f). In mLNs of Bcl-3TOE mice,
only the percentage of Foxp3 þ cells was reduced, whereas
the total cell number was similar to the numbers in littermate
controls (Fig. 4b), probably due to the enlargement in size of
mLNs in Bcl-3TOE mice. To explore whether the decreased
number of Tregs in LN and spleen was due to reduced numbers
of nTregs or iTregs, the expression of the transcription factor
Helios, which was previously used as a marker for thymus-
derived nTregs34, was analysed. Upon Bcl-3 overexpression, the
numbers of both nTregs and iTregs were significantly reduced
(Fig. 4c,d). Hence, Bcl-3 appears to regulate the development and
induction of nTregs, as well as iTregs. However, as a decrease in
Treg
numbers
does
not
necessarily
lead
to
immune
deregulation15,18,35, we tested whether Bcl-3 is crucial for the
function and maintenance of mature Tregs. Glucocorticoid-
induced tumour necrosis factor receptor (GITR) was described as
a critical regulator of the interface between Tregs and immune
effector cells36. FACS analysis of Treg cells from Bcl-3TOE mice
revealed decreased number of GITR þ Treg cells and, among
them, reduced expression levels of GITR as measured by mean
fluorescence intensities (Fig. 4e). Similarly, we found less cells
expressing
CTLA-4
and
lower
expression
levels
of
this
co-inhibitory molecule (Fig. 4e), which was shown to be
a potent negative regulator of T-cell immune responses.
To further evaluate the suppressive capacity of Bcl-3TOE Tregs,
we investigated the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine
IL-10, a key cytokine mediating the inhibitory activity of
Tregs, by intracellular staining. Upon stimulation, Bcl-3TOE
Tregs expressed decreased levels of IL-10 compared with Tregs
from littermate controls (Fig. 5a). Similarly, quantitative RT–PCR
confirmed a significant reduction in messenger RNA levels of
genes relevant for Treg cell development or function, such as
Ctla-4, Foxp3, Il10 and Il2r (Fig. 5b). Thus, our results suggest
that Bcl-3 suppresses Treg expansion through downregulation of
genes critically required for their function.
To test the function of Bcl-3 overexpressing Treg cells in vivo, we
examined their ability to suppress gut inflammation. Strikingly,
the transfer of Bcl-3TOE Tregs failed to prevent the development
of colitis mediated by naive T cells, in contrast to Tregs
from littermate controls (Fig. 5c). To further confirm that the

 spontaneous intestinal inflammation observed in the Bcl-3TOE mice
was due to a defect in the Treg suppressive capacity, we tested
whether control Tregs transferred into Bcl-3TOE mice can
prevent this inflammation. Indeed, transfer of control Tregs
ameliorated
the
development
of
colonic
inflammation
in
Bcl-3TOE mice, as these mice displayed remission of disease
compared with the untreated Bcl-3TOE control group (Fig. 5d). In
line with these data, the number of infiltrating immune cells such
as gd T cells, CD4þ T cells, CD11c þ dendritic cells and F4/80þ
macrophages was reduced in Bcl-3TOE mice upon transfer of
control Tregs (Fig. 5e). Hence, these data demonstrate that high
expression levels of Bcl-3 inhibit the suppressive function of Tregs,
leading to intestinal inflammation in Bcl-3TOE mice.
Bcl-3 regulates Treg development and function. To determine
whether Bcl-3 influences Treg cell development and function by
extrinsic factors or via an intrinsic mechanism, we crossed
Bcl-3OE mice with the Foxp3-IRES Cre mouse strain37 to obtain
mice, which overexpress Bcl-3 specifically in Tregs but not
conventional
ab
T
cells.
Strikingly,
the
analysis
of
the
Treg compartment in mLNs revealed an increased percentage
of Tregs in Bcl-3TregOE mice compared with littermate controls,
whereas the Treg numbers in Bcl-3TOE mice was significantly
reduced (Fig. 6a,b). As in Bcl-3TOE and Bcl-3TregOE mice the
GFP expression is coupled to Bcl-3 expression, we are able
to distinguish Bcl-3-overexpressing Tregs from GFP � Tregs
expressing
wild-type
(wt)
levels
of
Bcl-3
in
the
same
mouse. Of note, in Bcl-3TOE mice 14% of Foxp3 þ Tregs were
negative for GFP expression, pointing to the existence of Tregs
that
escaped
CD4-Cre-mediated
recombination
(Fig.
6c).
In Bcl-3TregOE mice, this effect was much more pronounced,
with about 50% of Foxp3 þGFP � T cells. Interestingly, the
analysis of CTLA-4 expression in GFP þ and GFP � Tregs
of Bcl-3TOE and Bcl-3TregOE mice revealed a significant reduction
of CTLA-4 expression and geometric mean fluorescence intensity
in
the
GFP þ
Treg
compartment
when
compared
with
GFP � Tregs (Fig. 6d). Taken together, these data indicate
that Bcl-3 negatively regulates the development and function of
Tregs intrinsically.
Bcl-3 interacts with NF-jB member p50 in Treg cells. As
changes in NF-kB member expression levels might be the
cause of impaired Treg function, we analysed whether Bcl-3
overexpression leads to altered expression levels or localizations
of some NF-kB family members. As the expression levels and
the nuclear localizations of p50, p52 and p65 were similar to
those of controls (Fig. 7a), we hypothesized that increased Bcl-3
expression directly modulates the activity of NF-kB in Tregs.
Bcl-3 was shown to inhibit or activate NF-kB-mediated gene
expression in the nucleus through direct binding to p50 and/or
p52 homodimers, which has been demonstrated in several cell
lines and primary B and T cells19,20,38–40. However, whether
Bcl-3 also binds p50 specifically in Tregs has not been addressed
so far. We therefore performed immunoprecipitation experiments
with extracts from wt Tregs using antibodies against Bcl-3. These
experiments show that endogenous Bcl-3 binds directly to p50
also in Tregs (Fig. 7b). To visualize their localization, we
performed confocal
microscopy in Tregs using antibodies

 directed against endogenous Bcl-3 and transfected p50. Indeed,
both proteins localize in close proximity in the nucleus of Treg
cells (Supplementary Fig. 6a).
As Bcl-3 overexpression led to reduced expression of Foxp3, as
well as IL-10, CTLA-4 and IL-2R (Fig. 4g), we performed
electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with DNA probes
from intergenic regions within these genes. These probes
highlight active H3K4 trimethylation in Tregs41 and contain
a
recognizable
kB
enhancer-binding
site42.
Incubating
these probes with nuclear lysates from cells overexpressing p50
revealed binding of p50 specifically to kB sites, as complexes were
nearly
absent
with
DNA
probes
with
point
mutations
in kB-binding sites (Supplementary Fig. 6b). We now wondered
whether Bcl-3 could alter p50 binding to sequences from these
regions as it has been previously suggested from different
contexts39,43,44.
Therefore,
we
performed
pull-down
assays
using Treg lysates and Bcl-3-expressing lysates with baits
is
appropriate
from
the
IL-2Ra,
Foxp3
and
IL-10
gene
segments, as well as chromatin immuneprecipitations (CHiP)
for p50 in Tregs from Bcl-3TOE mice.
Pull-down assays revealed that binding of endogenous p50 to
DNA was inhibited in the presence of Bcl-3 protein to an extent
similar to reactions using a NF-kB mutant probe (Fig. 7c).
Although p50 binding was not completely abolished, the
weakened binding seems to reflect the specific binding of p50
to DNA, as competition assays with cold probes revealed similar
results (Supplementary Fig. 6c).
Most importantly, this effect of Bcl-3 inhibiting p50 binding to
DNA occurs in Tregs themselves on Treg-relevant genes as seen
by CHiP experiments with p50-specific antibodies. We could
observe inhibited binding of p50 to the endogenous Foxp3,
as well as CTLA-4 promoter in Tregs of Bcl-3TOE mice, compared
with Treg cells of littermate controls (Fig. 7d). Although we
observe in all assays only a B50% reduction in binding of p50 to
DNA by elevated levels of Bcl-3, this inhibition was consistently
observed through all experiments and reflects also the extent to
which NF-kB targeted genes were reduced in expression (Fig. 5b).
Together, these experiments demonstrate that Bcl-3 can inhibit
the binding of p50 to promoters and sequences containing
a NF-kB site and are important for Treg development and
function.
Bcl-3 inhibits p50-mediated NF-jB gene activity. To test
whether Bcl-3 overexpression had a direct effect on p50-mediated
gene regulation in Tregs, we designed a reporter vector
containing the Foxp3 promoter with a kB-binding site that has
been previously shown to bind p50 (ref. 45). Indeed, these

 reporter assays revealed diminished activity of the Foxp3
promoter in Tregs from Bcl-3TOE compared with Tregs isolated
from littermate controls (Fig. 8a). To test whether this inhibitory
effect of Bcl-3 overexpression on gene activity was due to its
direct interaction and regulation of p50, we used a Bcl-3 mutant
that is unable to interact with p50 (ref. 46) (Fig. 8b). Strikingly,
this mutant was not able to repress gene activity compared with
wt Bcl-3 construct. In the presence of this construct, we observed
enhanced promoter activity (Fig. 8c), possibly functioning as a
dominant-negative protein. As NF-kB family members are
described to act as heterodimers for activation and as homo-
dimers for repression of genes19–22, we tested whether Bcl-3
affects gene expression through its interaction with the p50/p65
heterodimer. Indeed, we found that endogenous p65 from Tregs
is inhibited in its binding to designed IL-2Ra and Foxp3 probes in
the presence of lysates from Bcl-3-expressing cells. This inhibition
in binding was abrogated when we used the Bcl-3 mutant that is
unable to interact with p50 (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Most
importantly, when performing CHiP experiments for p65 in
Bcl-3TOE Tregs, we observed inhibited binding to the Foxp3 and
CTLA-4 promoter in Treg cells from Bcl-3TOE mice compared
with Tregs from littermate controls (Supplementary Fig. 7b),
although the inhibition is weaker compared with that seen for p50
(comparing Fig. 7d and Supplementary Fig. 7b). This finding
highlights that, through its interaction with p50, Bcl-3 inhibits the
binding of p50/p65 heterodimers to DNA. This result explains the
reduced gene activation of NF-kB-targeted genes in Tregs that we
observe in the presence of higher levels of Bcl-3.
We could demonstrate that the suppression of Treg function-
ality is a result of Bcl-3 interacting with p50 and preventing its
binding to DNA in Tregs. This Bcl-3-p50 interaction seems to
affect p50/p65 heterodimer binding to DNA potentially explain-
ing the negative effect of Bcl-3 on NF-kB-mediated transcription
of Treg genes. Hence, our data demonstrate the importance of
fine-tuning NF-kB activity during immune responses to prevent
the development of autoimmune inflammation.
Discussion
IBD is characterized by the infiltration of T cells that cause colon
damage and attract innate inflammatory immune cells. We found
drastically elevated expression levels of Bcl-3 in CD4 þ T cells
isolated from patients with CD and UC, underlining a role for
Bcl-3 in the pathogenesis of IBD. In mice, we could define a clear

 role for Bcl-3 in intestinal inflammation, as mice overexpressing
Bcl-3 in T cells develop spontaneous colitis. This disease was
accompanied by infiltration of various pro-inflammatory cells
into the colon, including gd T cells, which might account for the
increased levels of IL-17A detected in the colon of these mice.
Previous studies using Bcl-3 deficient animals suggested an
intrinsic function of Bcl-3 in constraining the plasticity of
pathogenic TH1 cells27. Interestingly, we found that high
expression of Bcl-3 in CD4 þ cells leads to a reduced number
of pathogenic effector T cells. Indeed, the spontaneous colitis seen
in our model is not driven by conventional ab T cells, as these
cells fail to proliferate and differentiate into pathogenic T cells
and in accordance fail to induce colitis in a passive T-cell transfer
model.
We found a suppressive dysfunction of Tregs from Bcl-3TOE
mice, as these cells secrete decreased levels of IL-10, shown to be
crucial for suppressing gd T-cell expansion and for the prevention
of spontaneous colitis in vivo4. Whether or not the reduced IL-10
production by Bcl-3-overexpressing Tregs is the sole reason for
the colitis is not clear, as we also noticed decreased expression
levels of Foxp3, CTLA-4, GITR and IL-2R in these Treg cells. In
accordance to the above data, the transfer of wt Tregs into
Bcl-3TOE mice blocked the development of colitis and inhibited
gd T-cell expansion in the colonic compartment of these mice.
These findings underline the suppressive dysfunction of Tregs
overexpressing Bcl-3.
Surprisingly, mice overexpressing Bcl-3 specifically in Treg
cells (Bcl-3FoxP3OE mice) did not develop any signs of colitis
probably due to the very high percentage of GFP � Foxp3 þ Treg
cells, which was less pronounced using CD4-Cre. These GFP �
Foxp3 þ cells could have escaped Cre-mediated recombination
and fill up the Treg compartment through a proliferative and/or
survival advantage over the cells that overexpress Bcl-3. However,
also the different time points of Cre activity and the cells targeted
could be a potential explanation of this inconsistency. Using the
CD4-Cre mouse, Bcl-3 is overexpressed in CD4-expressing T cells
during T-cell development, which results in elevated Bcl-3 levels
already before Treg development. In addition, in these mice all
conventional T cells overexpress Bcl-3 possibly indirectly also
influencing Treg cell development/proliferation and/or viability
of these cells. In contrast, enforced expression of Bcl-3 using
Foxp3-Cre mice occurs later, starting only after Treg cells already
developed and only in Foxp3 þ Treg leaving all conventional
T cells unaffected, and therefore functionally normal. This
difference in time of overexpression and the targeted cells
may affect how Treg cells are capable to deal with Bcl-3
overexpression.
It is well established that Bcl-3 plays an important role in
NF-kB regulation, either promoting or inhibiting target gene
expression depending on the cell type and stimulus received47.
Bcl-3 selectively interacts with p50 and p52 subunits of NF-kB via
its
ankyrin
domains,
thereby
regulating
NF-kB-dependent
gene
transcription20,48–50.
In
addition
to
its
numerous
posttranslational modifications influencing its mode of action,
Bcl-3 was also shown to act as an adaptor molecule, possibly
building a platform for other coactivators or repressors to
p50/p50 homodimers, thereby possibly influencing its mode of
action51. Previously, it has been suggested that NF-kB activity
is important for Treg development and differentiation, as
mice lacking p65, p50 and c-Rel show diminished Treg cell
development and defective Foxp3 gene expression15–17. However,
p50 and c-Rel-deficient mice do not develop spontaneous
autoimmunity
even
though
these
mice
display
decreased
numbers of Tregs and defective peripheral Treg differentiation.
Therefore, the exact mechanistic role of NF-kB signalling in
controlling immune homeostasis remains unknown.
Aberrant expression of Bcl-3 results in a wide range of defects
within the immune system but so far, no clear correlation
between Bcl-3 expression and subsequent NF-kB activation has
been reported for Treg function. In contrast, for T-helper subsets
a clear role for Bcl-3 in regulating NF-kB activity has been
demonstrated. Here, it was shown that Bcl-3 controls T-helper
cell plasticity by preventing the binding of c-Rel and p65 to
NF-kB binding sites in the RORgt promoter27. In the absence of
Bcl-3, c-Rel and p65 induce Rorc expression leading to Th17
differentiation52. In Th1 cells, Bcl-3 mediates the stabilization of
inhibitory p50 homodimers on NF-kB-binding sites, thereby
restricting RORgt expression27. Of note, our data using Bcl-3
transgenic mice clearly demonstrate that Bcl-3 overexpression has
a global effect on T-helper cell differentiation and impairs Treg
function. We found that enforced Bcl-3 expression has a cell
type-specific suppressive function in Treg cells leading to

 the gut of those mice, results in elevated NF-kB target gene
expression. This is in line with previously suggested context-
dependent functions of Bcl-3 (ref. 47). We show that in Tregs
Bcl-3 directly interacts with p50, thereby preventing its binding to
DNA and thus directly inhibiting NF-kB target gene expression,
thereby fine-tuning the function of Tregs. How this is achieved is
not clear, as Bcl-3 cannot bind to DNA, but it does exert
its functions in the nucleus. We show that Bcl-3 is also localized
in the nucleus of Treg cells. One possible mechanism is the
described interaction of Bcl-3 with histone deacetylases leading to
transcriptional termination53,54. We also observe transcriptional
inhibition in Treg cells by enforced Bcl-3 expression on
p50-regulated genes. In addition, we also show weaker binding
of p50 to DNA in the presence of high levels of Bcl-3. However,
the exact molecular mechanism for this still remains unclear.
We further propose that the direct interaction of Bcl-3-p50 also
prevents the binding of p50/p65 heterodimers to DNA but not
through a direct mechanism. p65 was recently illustrated to be
essential for Treg stability and controlling the functionality of
Tregs, as p65 inactivation specifically in Tregs induces multi-focal
autoimmune disease in mice17. Therefore, inhibition of p50/p65
activation by Bcl-3/p50 complexes is likely to be responsible for
the
suppressive
dysfunction
of
Bcl-3-overexpressing
Tregs,
leading to chronic inflammatory colitis in Bcl-3TOE mice.
Here we define a cell-type-specific molecular mechanism by
which Bcl-3 regulates NF-kB-dependent gene expression in Treg
cells. Our analyses demonstrate the importance to fine-tune Bcl-3
expression for the development and function of Treg cells, as
elevated levels of Bcl-3 expression leads to dysfunctional Tregs
resulting from diminished NF-kB activity. Specifically targeting
the activity of Bcl-3 in IBD may represent an effective strategy for
the inhibition of gut inflammation.
Methods
Patients biopsy collection. For the analysis of Bcl-3 expression in humans,
colonic tissue samples were obtained from patients with IBD (CD and UC) and
control patients without IBD, who underwent colonic resection or routine
colonoscopy (Table 1). Colonic specimens from biopsies and surgical resections
from patients with IBD were studied and compared with control samples. The
collection of human samples was approved by the Ethics committee of the
University Hospital, Friedrich-Alexander-Universita
¨t Erlangen-Nu
¨rnberg. Human
samples derived from the University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg
were analysed from therapeutically indicated biopsies following informed
consent and was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Landesa
¨rztekammer
Rheinland-Pfalz.
Immunohistochemistry in IBD patients and control subjects. Immuno-
fluorescence of cryo- or paraffin sections from gut specimens of control subjects
and patients with IBD was performed using the TSA Flurescein systems
(PerkinElmer) and a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX81)55. In brief, sections
were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, before staining paraffin was removed,
followed by incubation with avidin–biotin-blocking reagent (Vector, SP-2001) and
Roti-Immunoblock (ROTH, T144.1, 1:10 dilution in TBST þ 2% BSA) for
suppression of nonspecific background staining. Then sections were stained at 4 �C
overnight in a humidified chamber with primary antibody (anti-human CD4,
OKT4, BioLegend, 1:50 dilution) or (anti-Bcl-3, sc-185, Santa Cruz, 1:100 dilution).
Slides were incubated at room temperature for 30 min with biotinylated secondary
antibody (111-065-144, Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:1,000 dilution) or
(anti-mouse, BA-9200, Vector, 1:1,000 dilution) followed by incubation with TSA
kit reagents. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes,
Invitrogen, 1:10,000 dilution in TBS). Histological sections that were not optimal
for a proper analysis were discarded from the analysis.
Isolation of human LP T cells. LP mononuclear cells were isolated from freshly
obtained specimens from control and UC patients using Lamina Propria
Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotech, catalogue number: 130-097-410). In brief, tissue
was incubated in Hank’s balanced salt solution with EDTA and dithiothreitol
(DTT). After mechanical dissection by vortexing and passing through a cell
strainer, cell suspension of epithelial cells and IEL was removed. After incubation
with collagenase, DNase and dispase for 30 min at 37 �C, the suspension was
subjected to further purification of T cells. LP T cells were prepared from the
resultant cell population as described previously56. T cells were analysed for Bcl-3
expression by western blot analysis.
Mice. Bcl-3OE mice were generated as described previously30. Bcl-3OE mice were
crossed to CD4-Cre mice57 to generate Bcl-3TOE mice and to Foxp3-IRES-Cre
mice37 to generate Bcl-3TregOE mice. Age- and gender-matched genetically
modified animals carrying loxP sites without Cre transgene (Bcl-3OE mice) were
used as control mice on C57BL/6 background. Animals requiring veterinary
attention were provided with appropriate care and excluded from experiments. All
experiments were performed with 4- to 18-week-old mice (unless otherwise
specified). RAG1 � / �, Bcl-3OE, Bcl-3TOE and Bcl-3TregOE mice were bred in the
animal facility at the University of Mainz. All animal experiments were in
accordance with the guidelines of the Translational Animal Research Center,
University of Mainz, or to the guidelines of the Helmholtz Zentrum Mu
¨nchen.
Real-time PCR analysis. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Kit (catalogue
number: 74104, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Quantitative
real-time PCR was performed using Quantitec Primer Assay (Qiagen). Catalogue
number: IL-6: QT00098875; IFN-g: QT01038821; IL-17A: QT00103278; TNFa:
QT00104006; IL-10: QT00106169.
Flow cytometry. Single-cell suspensions were prepared from different organs. Red
blood cells in cell suspensions from the spleen were lysed with tris-ammonium
chloride pH 7.2. Cells were incubated with combinations of antibodies to cell
surface determinants. CD4, CD8a, CD25, CD44, CD62L, CTLA-4, Foxp3, GITR,
Helios, IL-10, TCRb and TCRgd antibodies were purchased either from BD,
eBioscience or Biolegend (see Supplementary Table 10). All samples were acquired
on a FACS Canto II BD and results were analysed with FlowJo software. Absolute
numbers of thymocyte, LN and splenocyte subpopulations were calculated based
on their percentage and total number.
Staining of Foxp3 together with retention of GFP. Single-cell suspensions were
prepared from mLNs. Cells were stained and fixed as described previously58. In
brief, cells were surface stained with antibodies purchased from eBioscience, BD
and BioLegend (see Supplementary Table 10). Cells were fixed with 2%
formaldehyde to retain EGFP. For intracellular staining of Foxp3 with EGFP
retention, 1 � Perm buffer (eBioscience) was used. Samples were acquired on
a FACS Canto II BD and results were analysed with FlowJo software.

 Cell purification. Cells from spleen and LNs were purified using CD4 þ
MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotech, catalogue number: 130-049-201), the CD4 þ
CD62L þ T-cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotech, catalogue number: 130-093-227) or
the CD4 þCD25 þ Treg cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotech, catalogue number:
130-091-041) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Purity as determined by
flow cytometry was over 95%.
Isolation of IEL and LPL. IELs and LPLs were isolated as described previously59. In
brief, large intestine IEL and LPL were isolated by using a combination of
mechanical dissociation and enzymatic digestion. The isolated cells were used
directly for FACS analysis.
Survival assay. CD4 þ T cells were isolated by using MicroBeads (Miltenyi
Biotech, catalogue number: 130-049-201) from spleens and LNs of 5-week-old
Bcl-3TOE mice and control littermates. Triplicates of 1 � 105 CD4 þ T cells were
cultured for 4 days in T-cell media at 37 �C. Each day cells were counted,
stained for AnnexinV (Immunotools, catalogue number: 31490016) and
7-aminoactinomycin D (BD Pharmingen, catalogue number: 559925) according to
the manufacturer’s instruction and analysed by FACS.
Western blot analysis of NF-jB members using Bcl-3TOE Tregs.
In vitro-generated Tregs were restimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
(PMA) and ionomycin for 2 h and nuclear extracts were prepared. The antibodies
used were as follows: anti-Bcl-3: Santa-Cruz (sc-185, 1:1,000 dilution) and Abgent
(WA-AP9337c, 1:1,000 dilution), anti-p50: Santa-Cruz, (E-10, 1:1,000 dilution) and
Abcam (ab7971, 1:1,000 dilution), anti-p65: Abcam (ab7970, 1:1,000 dilution),
anti-p52: Cell Signaling (4882, 1:1,000 dilution), anti-TATA binding protein
TBP[EPR3826(2)]: Abcam (ab125009, 1:2,000 dilution) and anti-Actin: Millipore
(MAB1501R, 1:5,000 dilution).
Adoptive transfer model of colitis. Magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS)-
purified naive CD4 þCD62L þ T cells (5 � 105) from wt and Bcl-3TOE mice were
injected intraperitoneallty (i.p.) in 6- to 8-week-old RAG1 � / � mice. After the cell
transfer, RAG1 � / � recipients were weight weekly and monitored by mini-
endoscopy.
In vivo Treg suppression assay. MACS-purified naive CD4 þCD25 � T cells
(5 � 105) from wt mice were injected i.p. into 6- to 8-week-old RAG1 � / � mice
alone or with equal numbers of wt or Bcl-3TOE MACS-purified CD4 þCD25 þ
Tregs. After the cell transfer, RAG1 � / � recipients were weight weekly and
monitored by mini-endoscopy.
Adoptive transfer of Tregs. Tregs (CD4 þCD25 þ) were isolated from LN and
spleen of littermate control mice by MACS purification and injected intravenously
(1 � 105) into Bcl-3TOE mice, three times every 3 weeks. Mice were monitored by
mini-endoscopy every 3 weeks. After 3 weeks from the last injection of wt Tregs,
colon tissue samples were collected for histological analysis.
In vivo high-resolution mini-endoscopy analysis of the colon. For monitoring of
colitis activity, a high-resolution video endoscopic system (Karl Storz) was used. To
determine colitis activity, mice were anaesthetized by injecting a mixture of
ketamine (Ketavest 100 mg ml � 1, Pfizer) and xylazine (Rompun 2%, Bayer
Healthcare) i.p. and monitored by mini-endoscopy at indicated time points.
Endoscopic scoring of five parameters (translucency, granularity, fibrin, vascularity
and stool) was performed.
Histology and immunohistochemistry in mice. Colonic cryosections were
stained with haematoxylin and eosin. For immunohistochemistry, colon
samples were isolated from control and colitic mice at indicated time points.
Immunofluorescence of cryosections was performed using the TSA Cy3 System
(NEL704A001KT, PerkinElmer) and a fluorescence microscope (IX70; Olympus)
using primary antibodies against CD4 (catalogue number: 553043, BD
Pharmingen, rm4-5, 1:00 dilution), CD11c (catalogue number 550283, BD, dilution
1:200), MPO (ab15484 Abcam, 1: 20 dilution), F4/80 (BM8 eBioscience, lot
14-4801-81, 1: 1,000 dilution) and TCRgd (BD Bioscience, clon No: h57-597
catalogue number: 553169, dilution 1:100). In brief, cryosections were fixed in
4% PFA for 20 min followed by sequential incubation with methanol, avidin/biotin
(Vector Laboratories) and protein blocking reagent (catalogue number: T144.1
Roti-ImmunoBlock, Roth) to eliminate unspecific background staining. Slides were
then incubated overnight with primary antibody specific for the respective antigen.
Subsequently, the slides were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with
biotinylated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch catalogue number:
127-065-160 and BD Pharmingen catalogue number: 554014). All samples were
finally treated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and stained with Tyramide
(Cy3) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (catalogue number:
NEL704A001KT, PerkinElmer). Before examination, nuclei were counterstained
with mounting medium for fluorescence with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(catalogue number: H-1200, Vector).
Confocal microscopy in T cells. Treg cells from Bcl-3TOE mice were
differentiated, expanded and electroporated with Flag-tagged p50 constructs
as in the section: Luciferase reporter Assays. Cells were re-stimulated with
PMA and Ionomycin for 2 h and attached to cover glass slides with poly-L-lysine
(SIGMA, P4832). Bcl-3 was stained with anti-Bcl-3 antibodies (Santa Cruz, sc-185
C-14) and p50 was visualized by staining for Flag tag with anti-Flag antibody
(E. Kremmer, 6F7).
T-cell isolation and in vitro differentiation. Naive CD4 þ CD62L þ T cells were
isolated by using MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotech, catalogue number: 130-104-453)
or Dyna and Detacha Beads (Invitrogen, catalogue number: 11445D and catalogue
number: 12406D, respectively) from spleens of 8- to 12-week-old C57BL/6 mice or
of Bcl-3TOE and control littermates, and activated with plate-bound anti-CD3
(using first anti-hamster, Novartis, catalogue number: 55397 then anti-CD3 in
solution: clone: 2C11H: 0.1 mg ml � 1) and soluble anti-CD28 (clone: 37 N:
1 mg ml � 1). TH0 and Treg cultures were additionally supplemented with blocking
antibodies anti-IL-4 (clone: 11B11, 10 mg ml � 1) and anti-IFN-g (clone: Xmg-121,
10 mg ml � 1). All antibodies were obtained in collaboration with and from Elisabeth
Kremmer (Helmholtz Center Munich). For Treg differentiation additionally the
following cytokines were added: rmIL-2 and rmTGF-b (both: R&D Systems,
5 ng ml � 1). For expansion of Treg cells, cells were cultured in RPMI and 2,000
units Proleukin S (MP Biomedicals, catalogue number: 02238131). For experi-
ments, only samples were used that achieved between 55–85% Foxp3 positive cells
(Staining Kit, BD Bioscience: catalogue number: 00552300).
Immunoprecipitation in Tcells. TH0 and Treg cells were generated and expanded
as described above and 1 � 108 cells were lysed in 4 ml Meister Lysis Buffer (20 mM
Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 0.25% NP40, 150 mM NaCl, 1,5 mM MgCl2 and Protease
Inhibitors (Roche, catalogue number: 04693132001) und 1 mM DTT). 60 ml
Protein-G beads (Dynabeads Protein G, catalogue number: 10004D) were
pre-coupled with 10 mg antibodies (anti-Bcl-3: Santa-Cruz, catalogue number:
sc-185; anti-p50: Abcam, catalogue number: ab7971) in PBS and 0.05% Tween and
then equilibrated in Meister Lysis Buffer and added to lysed cells and incubated
for 4 h. Washing was performed with Lysis Buffer. Proteins were eluted with
80 ml 1 � SDS La
¨mmli loading dye, one-fourth was used for western blot analysis.
Blottings were incubated with anti-p50 (Santa-Cruz, catalogue number: sc-8414)
and anti-Bcl-3 antibodies (Santa-Cruz, catalogue number: sc-185).
Luciferase assay in T cells. Reporter assays were performed as previously
described60. The Foxp3 promoter ( � 422- þ 20, position at Exon1) was cloned
into the pGL4.10 Luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega, catalogue number: E6651).
The TK-Renilla reporter plasmid (Promega, catalogue number: E2241) was used as
a control. Treg cells, polarized for 42 h as described above and expanded for 1 day
were transfected with different Luciferase reporter and control Renilla reporter
constructs by using the Mouse T Cell Nucleofector Kit (LONZA, catalogue
number: V4XP-3032) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sixteen hours
after electroporation, T cells were re-stimulated for 6 h with PMA (25 ng ml � 1,
Santa Cruz) and Ionomycin (1 mg ml � 1, Santa Cruz) and then harvested and
measured with the Dual Luciferase reporter system (Promega, catalogue
number: E1910). Renilla activity was used to normalize transfection efficiency
and Luciferase activity.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays. HEK293T cells (obtained by ATCC,
CRL-11269) were transfected by calcium phosphate transfection with
p50-expressing plasmids. Nuclear lysates were generated two days after transfection
by incubation in 2 ml (per 10 cm plate) Hypotonic Buffer (10 mM Hepes
pH 7.6, 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1.5 mM MgCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and the complete protease inhibitor mixture
(Roche, catalogue number: 11697498001) and then lysed with the addition of
0.01% Triton X-100. After centrifugation at maximum speed in an Eppendorf
microfuge for 15 s the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 250 ml of the Nuclear
Buffer (420 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes pH 7.9, 0.2 mM EDTA, 25% Glycerol, 1 mM
DTT, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with complete protease inhibitor
mixture). Nuclear proteins were extracted with intermittent vortexing and
incubation for 15 min at 4 �C. In vitro binding assays were performed using
reagents from the light-shift chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Thermo Scientific,
catalogue numbre: 20148) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, with the
exception of using IR Dye800-labelled probes (Table 2). Protein–DNA complexes
were separated by using 6% TBE Gels (Invitrogen) and LiCor Model 2800 used to
visualize EMSA bands.
Pull-down with DNA probes in T cells. For one pull-down reaction, 1 � 106 T
cells polarized and expanded as described above and nuclear extracts were
generated as described in the section ‘Electrophoretic mobility shift assays’, using

 1 ml Hypotonic Buffer and 90 ml Nuclear Buffer for 1 � 106 T cells. Binding
reactions of nuclear extracts to DNA probes were performed as in EMSA reactions
(using the Thermo Scientific buffers) scaled up 20 times for one pull-down
reaction, using 90 ml nuclear extracts of T cells plus 12 ml Bcl-3-overexpressing
293 T lysates or empty 293 T lysates. DNA probes were the same sequences as used
in EMSAs, biotin-labelled. Binding reactions were incubated for in total 1 h, then
40 ml Streptavidin beads were added (Invitrogen, catalogue number: 65001) and
rotated overnight at 4 �C. Proteins were eluted the next day with 2 � SDS La
¨mmli
Buffer and visualized via western blotting with anti-p50 antibodies (Abcam
ab7971). DNA sequences used in EMSAs and pulldowns are described in Table 2.
CHiP experiments in Treg cells. Bcl-3-overexpressing Tregs and Tregs from
littermate controls were generated as described before. Tregs (20 � 106) were
cross-linked with 1% Formaldehyde (10 min, room temperature) and crosslinking
reaction was stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 M.
CHiP assays were performed as described (PU1. DeKoter, Harinder Singh) with the
following minor changes: after sonification for 40 cycles (Bioruptor; 30 s on, 30 s off
at high), chromatin was diluted to 500 ml total volume in nuclei-lysis buffer with
protease inhibitors and added to 1.5 ml CHiP IP buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton
X-100, 1.2 mM EDTA, 16.7 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1 and 16.7 mM NaCl) with pro-
tease inhibitors. Antibodies (10 mg; anti-NFkB p105/p50, ab32360; anti-NFkB p65,
ab16502) were coupled to 50 ml Dynabeads Protein G (10004D) for 1 h at room
temperature and further blocked with sonicated salmon sperm DNA for 30 min
before washing. Beads and diluted chromatin were incubated at 4 �C over night and
washed with 1 ml of the following buffers each at RT for 5 min with rotation: buffer
I (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1 and 150 mM
NaCl), Buffer II (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH
8.1 and 500 mM NaCl), Buffer III (0.25 M LiCl, 1% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA and
10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1), 2 � TE pH 8.0. DNA precipitation was performed as
described61. All quantitative RT–PCRs were performed by the SYBR green method
with the following Primers: CTLA4 1 forw. 50-CTTCTACTTGGCAGGCTGGG-30
and rev. 50-CCACTGCCCTCCTTGGTATC-30. CTLA4 2 forw. 50-CCACACTG

Statistical analysis. For animal experiments to determine group size needed for
adequate statistical power, power analysis employing the program G*power was
performed using preliminary data sets. Mice of the indicated genotype were
assigned at random to groups. Mouse studies were performed in a blinded fashion.
Results are shown as mean±s.e.m. with the number of independent experiments.
Statistical significance was calculated using unpaired Student’s t-test; *Pr0.05,
**Pr0.001 and ***Pr0.0001; n.s., not significant. Groups were large enough to
fulfill the prerequisite of Student’s t-test as well as to determine that the variance
between groups is similar. The statistical significance of differences between human
groups was determined by analysis of variance.
