IMPORTANCE Effective and efficient treatment is needed for posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) in active duty military personnel.
OBJECTIVE To examine the effects of massed prolonged exposure therapy (massed therapy),
spaced prolonged exposure therapy (spaced therapy), present-centered therapy (PCT), and a
minimal-contact control (MCC) on PTSD severity.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial conducted at Fort Hood, Texas,
from January 2011 through July 2016 and enrolling 370 military personnel with PTSD who
had returned from Iraq, Afghanistan, or both. Final follow-up was July 11, 2016.
INTERVENTIONS Prolonged exposure therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy involving exposure
to trauma memories/reminders, administered as massed therapy (n = 110; 10 sessions over 2
weeks) or spaced therapy (n = 109; 10 sessions over 8 weeks); PCT, a non–trauma-focused
therapy involving identifying/discussing daily stressors (n = 107; 10 sessions over 8 weeks); or
MCC, telephone calls from therapists (n = 40; once weekly for 4 weeks).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Outcomes were assessed before and after treatment and at
2-week, 12-week, and 6-month follow-up. Primary outcome was interviewer-assessed PTSD
symptom severity, measured by the PTSD Symptom Scale–Interview (PSS-I; range, 0-51; higher
scores indicate greater PTSD severity; MCID, 3.18), used to assess efficacy of massed therapy at 2
weeks posttreatment vs MCC at week 4; noninferiority of massed therapy vs spaced therapy at 2
weeks and 12 weeks posttreatment (noninferiority margin, 50% [2.3 points on PSS-I, with
1-sided α = .05]); and efficacy of spaced therapy vs PCT at posttreatment.
RESULTS Among370randomizedparticipants,datawereanalyzedfor366(meanage,32.7[SD,

 P
osttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects 10% to 20%
of military personnel returning from deployments to
Iraq and Afghanistan1-3 and is often chronic and
debilitating.4,5 The psychological and physical toll of PTSD is
substantial,6 highlighting the need to develop effective treat-
ments. Prolonged exposure therapy for PTSD is a manual-
ized,trauma-focusedcognitivebehavioraltherapythathasem-
pirical support in civilians7 and veterans.8,9 However,
knowledge about the efficacy of prolonged exposure therapy
among active duty military personnel is limited to case
studies.10 One barrier to implementation of prolonged expo-
sured therapy in the military is treatment length (8-15 weeks),
which can conflict with military obligations. A shorter course
of therapy could hasten amelioration of PTSD, with the added
benefit of facilitating military readiness. Massed (daily) pro-
longed exposure therapy (massed therapy) has been demon-
strated to be as effective as weekly sessions for treatment of
agoraphobia,11 obsessive-compulsive disorder,12 and panic
disorder.13,14 A randomized clinical trial (RCT) in civilians with
PTSD found 1 week of daily cognitive therapy equivalent to 3
months of weekly sessions.15 Thus, massed therapy was ex-
pected to be noninferior to typical spaced prolonged expo-
sure therapy (spaced therapy).
In the current RCT, it was hypothesized that, among ac-
tive duty military with PTSD, (1) massed therapy would result
in lower symptom severity than a minimal-contact control
(MCC) condition at 2-week follow-up (given the intensity of
massed therapy, 10 sessions delivered over 2 weeks, its ef-
fects were hypothesized to increase through 2 weeks after end
of treatment); (2) massed therapy would be noninferior to
spaced therapy (10 sessions delivered over 8 weeks, an estab-
lished treatment, although never tested in an active duty
sample) at 2-week and 12-week follow-ups; and (3) spaced
therapy would result in lower symptom severity than present-
centered therapy (PCT; 10 sessions delivered over 8 weeks) at
posttreatment assessment.
Methods
Institutional review boards at Brooke Army Medical Center,
University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, and
University of Pennsylvania approved the protocol. Participants
providedwritteninformedconsentandself-reportedtheirrace,
ethnicity,andotherdemographiccharacteristicstopermitevalu-
ation of the representativeness of the sample. The study proto-
colandstatisticalanalysisplanareincludedintheSupplement.
Participants
Inclusion criteria were active duty military, activated Reserv-
ist, activated National Guard, or veterans who had deployed
to Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/
Operation New Dawn, ages 18 to 65 years; PTSD diagnosis ac-
cording to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis-
orders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR),16 assessed
via PTSD Symptom Scale Interview (PSS-I)17; exposure to a
DSM-IV-TR criterion A combat-related traumatic event (PTSD
could be indexed to a noncombat-related event); and com-
mand support to attend treatment. Exclusion criteria were cur-
rent bipolar or psychotic disorders, alcohol dependence, mod-
eratetoseveretraumaticbraininjury,suicidalideation,orother
disorders warranting immediate attention.
Procedures
The randomization sequence was entered by a study statisti-
cian into a secure, web-based application using SAS version
9.4 (SAS Institute Inc), which was accessed by the project co-
ordinator on enrollment of each participant. Randomization
was originally planned as 3:11:11:11 for MCC:massed therapy:
spaced therapy:PCT. On January 5, 2012, enrollment in MCC
was accelerated by changing the ratio to 1:1:1:1 to allow for pre-
liminary massed therapy vs MCC comparison per Depart-
ment of Defense request. After 40 participants were random-
ized to receive MCC, randomization to MCC was discontinued
on March 19, 2014, and subsequent participants were as-
signedtoreceivemassedtherapy,spacedtherapy,orPCT(1:1:1).
Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine if the re-
sults were affected by the different randomization patterns.
Randomization pattern was dummy coded and then added as
a moderator to the analyses. There were no significant main
effects or interactions involving randomization pattern, sug-
gesting that the results did not differ between randomization
patterns. On September 11, 2015, the analyses were pre-
sented to the Department of Defense external advisory board
for review. The study team decided to publish the results of
the entire study concurrently.
PTSD symptom severity was assessed by independent
evaluators blinded to treatment condition, before and after
treatment, and at 2-week, 12-week, and 6-month follow-up.
The MCC condition terminated at 2-week follow-up. Symp-
tom severity was also assessed every session by self-report for
spaced therapy and PCT, and every other session for massed
therapy. After the 2-week follow-up, participants in the MCC
group were offered their choice of the other treatments. Data
were collected from January 2011 to July 2016, when target en-
rollment was met and the final data point was collected.
Key Points
Questions Among active military with posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), are 10 sessions of prolonged exposure therapy
(a trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy) delivered over
2 weeks (massed therapy) more effective than minimal contact
and noninferior to 10 sessions delivered over 8 weeks (spaced
therapy) for reducing PTSD symptom severity, and does spaced
therapy reduce PTSD symptom severity more than
present-centered therapy (PCT)?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial (N = 366 active military
with PTSD), massed therapy showed greater decrease in PTSD
symptom severity than minimal contact and was noninferior to
spaced therapy. There were no differences in PTSD symptom
severity reduction between spaced therapy and PCT.
Meaning Massed therapy was noninferior to spaced therapy for
reducing PTSD symptoms in active military personnel, although
the reductions in PTSD symptom severity with all treatments were
relatively modest.

 Primary PTSD Measure: PTSD Symptom Scale–Interview
The PTSD Symptom Scale–Interview (PSS-I)17 is a 17-item clini-
cal interview that evaluates DSM-IV PTSD symptom fre-
quency and severity and can provide DSM-IV-TR PTSD diag-
nosis (score range, 0-51; higher scores indicate greater PTSD
symptom severity). Test-retest reliability (0.80) and inter-
rater reliability (κ = 0.91) are excellent.17 In the current sample,
internal consistency averaged α = .79.
Theminimalclinicallyimportantdifference(MCID)hasnot
been previously established for the PSS-I. As recommended,18
the MCID for PTSD was calculated as one-half of the SD at base-
line (ie, one-half of 6.36, or 3.18). The PSS-I was used to as-
sess PTSD symptom severity and PTSD diagnostic status.
Secondary PTSD Measure: PTSD Checklist–Stressor-Specific
ThePTSDChecklist–Stressor-Specific(PCL-S)19isa17-itemself-
report measure assessing PTSD severity (score range, 17-85;
higher scores indicate greater PTSD severity). Internal consis-
tency is α = .89 to .97, and test-retest reliability is 0.96 at 2 to
3 days. The internal consistency for the present sample was
α = .88.19 The MCID for the PCL-S is 7.9.20
Additional Measures
Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey
The Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12)21 is a
12-item measure that includes physical and mental compo-
nents, which were used as baseline covariates in the analyses.
Adverse Events
Clinically significant untoward changes in physical or mental
health were recorded by study staff as possible adverse events
for safety evaluation.
Interventions
Massed Prolonged Exposure Therapy
Prolonged exposure therapy22 is a manualized cognitive be-
havioral therapy consisting of imaginal exposure (repeated
recounting of the most disturbing traumatic memory) fol-
lowed by processing thoughts and feelings related to the ima-
ginal experience; in-vivo exposure (approaching trauma-
related situations), psychoeducation about PTSD, and
controlled breathing training. Between sessions, participants
listened to audio recordings of the imaginal recounting daily
and completed in-vivo exercises. Daily sessions were admin-
istered on 10 consecutive weekdays over a 2-week period.
Spaced Prolonged Exposure Therapy
Spaced therapy was implemented in the same way as massed
therapy, except that the 10 sessions were delivered over 8
weeks: 6 once weekly, and 2 twice weekly during the first and
last weeks. This is consistent with how prolonged exposure
therapy has been implemented with civilians and veterans in
previous studies; prolonged exposure therapy is typically de-
livered in 8 to 15 once- or twice-weekly sessions.
Present-Centered Therapy
Present-centered therapy is a non–trauma-focused, manual-
ized treatment that controls for nonspecific therapeutic
factors.23 Ten 90-minute sessions were scheduled similarly to
spaced therapy and focused on current life problems that may
or may not be PTSD-related. Therapists helped participants
identify stressors and discussed them in a supportive, nondi-
rective manner.
Minimal-Contact Control
TheMCCconditionconsistedof10-to15-minutetherapisttele-
phone calls once weekly for 4 weeks. Participants were asked
about their well-being, offered support as needed, and re-
ceived contact information in case symptoms worsened.
Therapist Training and Supervision
Therapists were 2 credentialed psychologists and 1 creden-
tialed social worker who had completed a 4-day prolonged ex-
posure therapy workshop, a 2-day PCT workshop, and 2 su-
pervised cases of prolonged exposure therapy and PCT.
Therapy sessions were videotaped for purposes of supervi-
sion and treatment-adherence monitoring. Weekly consulta-
tion calls for prolonged exposure therapy and PCT were con-
ducted separately.
Data Analysis
Sample sizes were determined before data collection using
NCSS-PASS version 2005 (NCSS). A sample size of 110 was cal-
culated for massed therapy and spaced therapy to achieve
power 90% or greater for their noninferiority test (assuming
a standardized difference of d = 0.4 [2.5 units on PSS-I]).24
Sample size for PCT was set to equal that for spaced therapy.
A sample size of 40 for MCC was calculated to provide power
90% or greater to detect a medium effect size (d = 0.50 [3.1
units on the PSS-I]).25 Pattern mixture modeling was used to
evaluate the effects of missing data26 and to provide a sensi-
tivityanalysisfortheeffectofmissingdata.Thisapproachcom-
pares growth curve parameters of participants with complete
vs missing data.
Linear mixed models and generalized linear mixed mod-
els were used to analyze the data, using SPSS version 23
(IBM SPSS). These models are intent-to-treat and calculate re-
sults based on available data without imputation of missing
data.27 Piecewise models, with separate slopes during treat-
ment and follow-up, were used for analyses. Per protocol,
analysesincludedthecovariatesbaselinelevelofoutcome,age,
sex, and baseline mental and physical functioning. In each
analysis,nonsignificantcovariates(definedas P > .05)werere-
moved and final models recomputed.
Significance for the superiority tests (hypothesis 1
[massed therapy would be more effective that MCC], and
hypothesis 3 [spaced therapy would be more effective than
PCT]) at the primary assessment points was set at P < .05
(2-sided). Superiority tests were conducted by examining dif-
ferences between treatment conditions in the decrease in
symptom severity from baseline (as indicated by the treat-
ment × time interaction), and treatment condition differ-
ences at the relevant assessment point. Follow-up analyses
examining each hypothesis at all posttreatment assessments
were corrected for multiple tests using the Benjamini-
Hochberg correction.28

 For hypothesis 2 (massed therapy would be noninferior
to spaced therapy), a noninferiority analysis was conducted,
with the 1-sided α set at .05. To be noninferior, the upper
bound of the 1-sided 95% CI of the difference between
treatments must be less than the noninferiority margin. In
noninferiority trials, the noninferiority margin should be
a proportion of the difference between the effect of the
established treatment (spaced therapy) and the control
group (MCC).29 To be conservative, 50% of the posttreat-
ment effect of the established treatment was used,29 which
was smaller than the MCID for the primary outcome (PSS-I)
and the secondary outcome (PCL-S). The efficacy of spaced
therapy has not previously been established in active mili-
tary personnel.
Effect sizes were calculated following the method of
Feingold,30 or t-to-d conversion, as appropriate.

Preliminary Analyses
Participants were 370 military personnel at Fort Hood, Texas.
Four participants were removed from the analyses; data analy-
ses included 366 participants. Figure 1 shows patient flow and
participation in the trial. Demographic characteristics are re-
ported in Table 1. Means for all outcomes at all end points are
reported in Table 2. During treatment, dropout was n = 0 for
MCC, n = 15 (13.6%) for massed prolonged exposure therapy,
n = 27 (24.8%) for spaced prolonged exposure therapy, and
n = 13 (12.1%) for PCT (no significant differences among ac-
tive treatments). At 6-month follow-up, dropout was n = 48
(43.6%) for massed therapy, n = 53 (48.6%) for spaced therapy,
and n = 48 (44.9%) for PCT (no significant group differ-
ences). Participants with missing data did not significantly dif-
ferfromcompletersonbaselinevariables.Further,patternmix-
ture modeling found no significant differences in the change
in outcome over time between participants with missing data
and those without missing data.
There were no significant treatment group differences on
baseline variables.
Treatment Adherence
The mean number of sessions completed were 9.04 (SD, 2.60)
formassedtherapy,8.59(SD,2.68)forspacedtherapy,and9.10
(SD, 2.53) for PCT. Participants in the MCC group completed
a mean of 1.86 (SD, 0.35) calls during the first 2 weeks and 1.68
(SD, 0.64) the second 2 weeks. Three randomly selected videos
from each participant were reviewed for treatment adherence
byindependentraters.Adherencewas96.36%forprolongedex-
posure therapy elements and 92.63% for PCT elements.
Massed Therapy vs MCC
Because MCC underwent accelerated recruitment, its sample
was completed before completion of the full massed therapy
sample.Thus,thesampleforthemassedtherapyvsMCCanaly-
siswaslimitedtoparticipantsinthemassedtherapygroupwho
were recruited and randomized during the same time frame
asparticipantsintheMCCgroup(n = 75ofn = 110inthemassed

groups were included in the analysis for different hypotheses, MLM calculated
different covariances between groups and time points, resulting in slightly

for PCT or MCC, since they were only involved in 1 comparison each. For

were from the entire sample (n = 110) for massed therapy. For massed therapy,
the elapsed time between baseline and the posttreatment assessment and

therapy lasted 2 weeks, while the treatment phase for spaced prolonged
exposure therapy and PCT lasted 8 weeks.

 Primary Outcome
PSS-I scores decreased during treatment (ie, over 2 weeks) for
massed therapy, then leveled off at 8 weeks (Figure 2A). Small
decreases in PSS-I scores in the MCC group continued through
follow-up. Decreases in PSS-I scores from baseline to 2-week
follow-up (week 4) were significant for both massed therapy
(decrease,7.13;t216 = 7.66;P < .001;d = 1.04)andMCC(decrease,

Piecewise models with separate slopes during treatment and follow-up were
used for mixed-model analyses of Posttraumatic Stress Scale–Interview (PSS-I)
scores, and the following variables were included as covariates: baseline PSS-I,
age, sex, and baseline mental and physical functioning. Final models were
recomputed by dropping nonsignificant covariates in each analysis. Data are
from the mixed-model analyses (MLM). Because different pairs of groups were
included in the analysis for different hypotheses, MLM calculated different
covariances between groups and time points, resulting in slightly different
estimated mean scores for the spaced prolonged exposure therapy (spaced
therapy) group depending on the hypothesis (2 or 3) being tested. This did not
occur for present-centered therapy (PCT) or minimal-contact control (MCC),
since they were only involved in 1 comparison each. For massed prolonged
exposure therapy (massed therapy), the means for comparison to MCC were
calculated from a subsample of 75 of the total n=110 because those 75 were
recruited concurrently with the sample for MCC. The massed therapy means for
comparing massed therapy with spaced therapy were from the entire sample of
n=110 for massed therapy. The full range of scores on the PSS-I is 0-51. Error
bars indicate 95% CIs from the mixed-model analyses.

 Secondary Outcomes
Decreases in both PCL-S scores and the rate of PTSD diagno-
sis from baseline to 2-week follow-up were significant for
massed therapy (PCL-S decrease, 15.52; t298 = 10.95; P < .001;
d = 1.27; diagnosis decrease, 45.4%; t310 = 2.62; P = .009;
d = 0.30), but only PCL-S score decreases were significant for
MCC (PCL-S decrease, 6.13; t292 = 3.37; P = .001; d = 0.39)
(Table2).Thesedecreasesweresignificantlygreaterformassed
therapy than for MCC on the PCL-S (treatment × time interac-
tion,9.38[95%CI,4.85to13.92];t294 = 4.07;P < .001;d = 0.47),
but massed therapy did not differ significantly from MCC on
decreases in diagnosis. At 2-week follow-up, massed therapy
had significantly lower mean PCL-S scores (40.28 vs 49.25 for
MCC; difference, 8.96 [95% CI, 5.25 to 12.68]; t263 = 4.75;
P < .001; d = 0.89) and lower mean rates of PTSD diagnosis
(54.6% vs 77.1% for MCC; difference, 22.5% [95% CI, 7.5% to
32.8%]; t310 = 2.81; P = .005; d= .32) (Table 2).
Nineteenofthe75participantsinthemassedtherapygroup
(25.3%) reported a total of 25 adverse events during treat-
ment; 12 of these adverse events were study-related. Thir-
teen of the 40 participants in the MCC group (32.5%) re-
ported a total of 20 adverse events during treatment; 1 of these
was study-related. Few participants experienced adverse
events that resulted in emergency department visits or hos-
pitalization during the intervention period (n = 3 [4%] partici-
pants for massed therapy, n = 4 [10%] for MCC); 1 suicide at-
tempt occurred in the MCC group.
Massed Therapy vs Spaced Therapy
Primary Outcome
The difference in mean PSS-I scores between massed therapy
and spaced therapy at the 2-week follow-up was 0.79 (massed
therapy was worse than spaced therapy [1-sided 95% CI,
−� to 2.29]; P = .049 for noninferiority) (Figure2B, Figure 3,
and Table 4). The upper bound of the 1-sided 95% CI was less
than the noninferiority margin of 2.3 (Figure 3), indicating that
the comparison of massed therapy with spaced therapy met
criteria for noninferiority at 2-week follow-up (4 weeks from
treatment inception for massed therapy, 10 weeks for spaced
therapy). At 12-week follow-up (14 weeks for massed therapy,
20 for spaced therapy), the difference in mean PSS-I scores be-
tween massed therapy and spaced therapy was 0.55 (1-sided
95% CI, −� to 2.05; P = .03 for noninferiority), meeting crite-
ria for noninferiority at 12-week follow-up.
Secondary Outcomes
For the secondary outcomes, noninferiority margins were de-
fined as 5.56 for change in PCL-S score and 14.3% for rate of
PTSD diagnosis. At 2-week follow-up, the difference in PCL-S
scores between massed therapy and spaced therapy was 0.90
(1-sided 95% CI, −� to 3.17]; P < .001 for noninferiority). The
PTSD diagnosis difference was 2.7% (1-sided 95% CI, −� to
13.8%; P = .043 for noninferiority). At 12-week follow-up, the
differenceinPCL-Sscoresbetweenmassedtherapyandspaced
therapy was 0.55 (1-sided 95% CI, −� to 2.82; P < .001 for non-
inferiority). The difference in rate of PTSD diagnosis was 0.5%
(1-sided 95% CI, −� to 11.5%; P = .02 for noninferiority). Since
the 1-sided 95% CIs were less than the noninferiority mar-
gins, massed therapy was considered noninferior to spaced
therapy for the secondary outcomes.
Noninferiority at Other Assessments
For the primary outcome (PSS-I), post hoc analyses revealed
that the 1-sided 95% CI for the difference between massed
therapy and spaced therapy was less than the noninferiority
margin at posttreatment assessment and 6-month follow-up,
suggesting noninferiority. Similarly, for the secondary out-
comes, the 1-sided 95% CIs for the difference between treat-
ments was less than their noninferiority margins at both
posttreatment and 6-month follow-up.
A total of 59 participants in the spaced therapy group
(54.1%) reported adverse events (115 events) during treat-
ment, whereas 50 participants in the massed therapy group
(46.7%) reported adverse events (96 events). The number of
study-related adverse events was not significantly different in
the spaced therapy vs massed therapy groups (23 vs 12, re-
spectively; P = .04). During treatment, 7 participants in both

Spaced Therapy vs PCT
Primary Outcome
Decreases in PSS-I scores from baseline to posttreatment as-
sessment (8 weeks after baseline) were significant for both
spaced therapy (decrease, 7.21; t401 = 8.39; P < .001; d = 0.84)
and PCT (decrease, 7.31;t394 = 8.62; P < .001; d = 0.87), and the
decreases were not significantly different between condi-
tions (treatment × time interaction, 0.10 [95% CI, −2.48 to
2.27]; t398 = 0.08; P = .93) (Table 5). Changes in mean levels of
PSS-I did not differ significantly between the spaced therapy
and PCT groups at posttreatment follow-up (ie, week 8)
(Figure 2C).
Secondary Outcomes
Decreases from baseline to posttreatment follow-up for PCL-S
scores and rates of PTSD diagnosis were significant in the
spacedtherapygroup(PCL-Sscoredecrease,14.91;t1462 = 21.64;
P < .001; d = 1.13; PTSD diagnosis decrease, 46.4%; t1155 = 7.04;
P = <.001; d = 0.41) and the PCT group (PCL-S score decrease,
11.33; t1425 = 16.94; P < .001; d = 0.90; PTSD diagnosis de-
crease, 40.3%; t1155 = 6.35; P < .001; d = 0.37). The PCL-S score
decrease for spaced therapy was significantly greater than the
decrease for PCT (treatment × time interaction, 3.58 [95% CI,
1.70 to 5.47]; t1445 = 3.73; P < .001; d = 0.34), but the decrease
in PTSD diagnosis was not significantly different between con-
ditions. Consistent with these data, levels of PCL-S symp-

thanforPCT(difference,2.98[95%CI,0.23to5.72];t262 = 2.14;
P < .03; d = 0.26) (Table 2). However, there were no signifi-
cant differences between conditions in PTSD diagnosis at post-
treatment follow-up.
Spaced Therapy vs PCT at Follow-up Assessments
On the primary outcome (PSS-I), there were no significant dif-
ferences between spaced therapy and PCT at any of the time
points (Table 2), regardless of whether P values were cor-
rected for multiple tests. Similarly, there were no significant
treatment condition differences at any of the time points for
the secondary outcomes (PCL-S and PTSD diagnosis). Fifty of
the 107 participants in the PCT group (46.7%) reported 96 ad-
verse events during treatment; 1 of these adverse events was
study-related. Eight participants in the PCT group (7.5%) ex-
perienced adverse events that resulted in emergency depart-
ment visits or hospitalization during the intervention.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first RCT examining the efficacy
of prolonged exposure therapy for combat-related PTSD in ac-
tive duty military personnel, and the first to examine an in-
tensive, massed prolonged exposure therapy format in this
population.Ashypothesized,massedtherapy(10sessionsover
2 weeks) resulted in lower PTSD symptom severity than MCC

a Data are from the mixed-model analyses (MLM). Because different pairs of
groups were included in the analysis for different hypotheses, MLM calculated
different covariances between groups and time points, resulting in slightly
different estimated mean scores for the spaced therapy group depending on
the hypothesis (2 or 3) being tested. This did not occur for PCT.

 at 2-week follow-up and was noninferior to spaced prolonged
exposure therapy (10 sessions over 8 weeks) at posttreat-
mentfollow-uponreductionsinPTSDsymptomseverity.Apo-
tential advantage of massed therapy was the low dropout rate
(13.6%),increasingthepossibilitythatpatientswillbenefitfrom
a full dose of treatment.31
The hypothesis that massed therapy would be noninfe-
rior to standard spaced therapy was supported. Thus, the con-
cern that daily prolonged exposure therapy would be too emo-
tionallytaxingwasnotsupported.Thenoninferiorityofmassed
therapytospacedtherapyisparticularlyimportantforthemili-
tary, because 2-week treatment not only is associated with
more rapid symptom improvement but also may reduce in-
terference with the demanding military schedule. In addi-
tion, military installations that lack clinicians with expertise
in evidence-based treatments can more feasibly refer pa-
tients with PTSD to clinical experts at another installation for
2 weeks rather than for 2 to 3 months of standard treatment.
The hypothesis that spaced therapy would result in lower
symptomseveritythanPCTwasnotsupported.Spacedtherapy
was not significantly different than PCT on the primary out-
come of interviewer-assessed PTSD symptom severity or on
therateofPTSDdiagnosis.Spacedtherapydidshowlowerself-
reported PTSD symptom severity than PCT at posttreatment
follow-up on a secondary outcome (PCL-S score), but this dif-
ference was small (3 points, less than one-half the MCID) and
was nonsignificant at later follow-up. PCT as delivered in this
study exceeds usual care at many military treatment facili-
ties(eg,PCThad90-minuteweeklysessions,manualizedtreat-
ment, problem solving). Nonetheless, the results suggest that
trauma-focused treatment may not be necessary for PTSD im-
provement in active duty military personnel.
The efficacy of massed therapy and spaced therapy in this
military sample was lower than previous findings for inten-
sive cognitive therapy in civilians with PTSD.15 Similarly, the
efficacy of spaced therapy in this study was lower than that
ofspacedtherapyincivilians(7-vs16-pointreductionsinPSS-I
score32). These results are similar to 2 RCTs of cognitive pro-
cessing therapy for PTSD in military personnel that also found
that treatment was less efficacious for military personnel than
for civilians.33,34 This suggests that well-established evidence-
based treatments for PTSD may be less efficacious for active
duty military personnel with PTSD and that modifications to
these treatments, or alternative treatments, may be needed to
achieve better outcomes. It is also possible that some active
duty personnel had less time to complete treatment home-
work or may have more incentives to retain PTSD symptoms
than other PTSD populations.
This study has several limitations. First, the design did not
include an active 2-week comparison treatment for massed
therapy. However, because this was the first study to evalu-
ate intensive prolonged exposure therapy in military person-
nel, the use of an MCC condition was required by the Depart-
ment of Defense external advisory board and supported by the
respective institutional review boards. Second, participants in
the massed therapy group may have lacked time to suffi-
ciently practice homework assignments. Third, because par-
ticipantsweretreatmentseeking,theresultsarelimitedtomili-
tarypersonnelseekingtreatmentforPTSD.Fourth,thedropout
rateduringtreatmentrangedfrom12.1%(PCT)to24.8%(spaced
therapy), and only 59% of randomized participants com-
pleted the full study. Treatment effects likely would have been
larger if a greater proportion of participants had completed the
treatment portion of the study.
Conclusions
Among active duty military personnel with PTSD, massed pro-
longed exposure therapy (10 sessions delivered over 2 weeks)
reduced PTSD symptom severity more than minimal contact
control at 2-week follow-up and was noninferior to spaced pro-
longed exposure therapy (10 sessions delivered over 8 weeks),
andtherewasnosignificantdifferencebetweenspacedtherapy
and present-centered therapy. The reductions in PTSD symp-
tom severity with all treatments were relatively modest, sug-
gesting that further research is needed to determine the clini-
cal importance of these findings.
