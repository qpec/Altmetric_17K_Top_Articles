IMPORTANCE Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) improves survival after acute myocardial infarction
(AMI), and referral to CR has been introduced as a performance measure of high-quality care.
The association of participation in CR with patients’health status (eg, quality of life,
symptoms, and functional status) is poorly defined.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association of participation in CR with health status outcomes
after AMI.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective cohort study was conducted of patients
enrolled in 2 AMI registries: PREMIER, from January 1, 2003, to June 28, 2004, and
TRIUMPH, from April 11, 2005, to December 31, 2008. The analytic cohort was restricted to
4929 patients with data available on baseline health status, 6- or 12- month follow-up health
status, and participation in CR. Data analysis was performed from 2014 to 2015.
EXPOSURES Participation in at least 1 CR session within 6 months of hospital discharge.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Patient health status was quantified using the Seattle
Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) and the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). The primary
outcomes of interest were the mean differences in SAQ domain scores during the 12 months
after AMI between patients who did and did not participate in CR. Secondary outcomes were
the mean differences in the SF-12 summary scores and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS After successfully matching the cohorts of the 4929 patients (3328 men and 1601
women; mean [SD] age, 60.0 [12.2] years) for the propensity to participate in CR and comparing
the groups using linear, mixed-effects models, mean differences in the SAQ and SF-12 domain
scores were similar at 6 and 12 months between the 2012 patients participating in CR (3 were
unable to be matched) and the 2894 who did not participate (20 were unable to be matched).
At 6 months, the mean difference was –0.76 (95% CI, –2.05 to 0.52) for the SAQ quality of life
score, –1.53 (95% CI, –2.57 to –0.49) for the SAQ angina frequency score, 0.38 (95% CI, –0.51 to
1.27) for the SAQ treatment satisfaction score, –0.42 (95% CI, –1.65 to 0.79) for the SAQ physical
limitation score, 0.50 (95% CI, –0.22 to 1.22) for the SF-12 physical component score, and
0.13 (95% CI, –0.53 to 0.79) for the SF-12 mental component score. At 12 months, the mean
difference was –0.89 (95% CI, –2.20 to 0.43) for the SAQ quality of life score, –1.05 (95% CI,
–2.12 to 0.02) for the SAQ angina frequency score, 0.38 (95% CI, –0.54 to 1.29) for the SAQ
treatment satisfaction score, –0.14 (95% CI, –1.41 to 1.14) for the SAQ physical limitation score,
0.17 (95% CI, –0.57 to 0.92) for the SF-12 physical component score, and 0.12 (95% CI, –0.56 to
0.80) for the SF-12 mental component score. In contrast, the hazard rate of all-cause mortality
(up to 7 years) associated with participating in CR was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.46-0.75).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In a cohort of 4929 patients with AMI, we found that those who
did and did not participate in CR had similar reported health status during the year following
AMI; however, participation in CR did confer a significant survival benefit. These findings
underscore the need for increased use of validated patient-reported outcome measures to
further examine if and how health status can be maximized for patients who participate in CR.

C
ardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an important component
of secondary prevention after acute myocardial
infarction (AMI).1,2 Supported by systematic reviews
and meta-analyses documenting reduced mortality associ-
ated with participation in CR,3-6 the American Heart Associa-
tion and American College of Cardiology have designated
referral to CR as a class IA recommendation and endorsed it
as a performance measure for the quality of care of patients
with AMI.2,7,8 Although health status improvement is among
the commonly cited goals and benefits of CR,8,9 there is
sparse evidence on the effect of CR on patient-reported
health status (eg, patients’symptoms, function, and quality
of life [QoL]).
Examining the health status benefits of CR can enable cli-
nicians and health care professionals who provide CR to bet-
ter inform patients about the potential benefits of participat-
ing in CR. To better examine the association of CR with health
status outcomes after AMI, we used detailed, patient-
centered data from 2 large multicenter AMI registries in the
United States: the Prospective Registry Evaluating Myocar-
dial Infarction: Events and Recovery (PREMIER)10 and the
Translational Research Investigating Underlying Disparities in
Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients’Health Status study
(TRIUMPH)11 to compare patient-reported health status be-
tween those who did and did not participate in CR.
Methods
Participants and Data Collection
Details regarding the study designs, patient selection crite-
ria, site characteristics, and follow-up assessments of the
PREMIER10 and TRIUMPH11 studies have been described pre-
viously. Briefly, both studies were US multicenter, prospec-
tive, observational AMI registries with similar study proto-
cols. A total of 2498 patients from 19 medical centers were
enrolled into PREMIER (January 1, 2003, to June 28, 2004),
while TRIUMPH (April 11, 2005, to December 31, 2008) en-
rolled 4340 patients across 21 sites (9 sites participated in both
registries). The PREMIER and TRIUMPH study sites included
large academic medical centers, single-payer systems, inner-
city hospitals, and non–university hospitals. Eligible patients
were required to present to or be transferred to an enrolling
site within 24 hours of presentation. Elevated biomarkers and
either prolonged ischemic signs and symptoms or ischemic
changes on results of electrocardiography were used to con-
firm diagnosis of AMI. Data regarding baseline patient demo-
graphics, comorbidities, and health status, in addition to hos-
pital course and management, were obtained through
abstraction of medical records and detailed, structured inter-
views conducted by trained research staff during hospital ad-
mission. Follow-up data regarding participation in CR and
health status were obtained through centralized, standard-
ized telephone interviews at 1, 6, and 12 months after hospi-
tal discharge. Each of the 30 participating sites obtained in-
stitutional review board approval, and all patients provided
written informed consent for study enrollment, data collec-
tion, and follow-up.
Study Population and Analytic Cohort
A total of 6838 patients with AMI were enrolled in the
TRIUMPH and PREMIER studies. For our primary analysis,
we restricted our cohort to patients who had data available
on baseline health status, follow-up health status at 6 or 12
months, and participation in CR. Accordingly, excluded
patients were those who died before 6-month follow-up
(n = 323), died between the 6- and 12-month follow-up with-
out any follow-up data (n = 97), were missing data on base-
line health status (n = 50), were missing data on 6- and 12-
month follow-up health status (n = 1094), and were missing
data on participation in CR (n = 345), leaving a final analytic
cohort of 4929 patients (Figure 1).
Cardiac Rehabilitation
Information about participation in CR was obtained through
centralized, standardized telephone interviews at 1 and 6
months after hospital discharge. Cardiac rehabilitation pro-
grams at participating sites from both registries were institu-
tional based. During the 1- and 6-month follow-up telephone

Key Points
Question What is the association between participation in cardiac
rehabilitation and health status outcomes of patients after acute
myocardial infarction?
Findings In this cohort study of 4929 patients enrolled in 2 acute
myocardial infarction registries, mean Seattle Angina
Questionnaire domain scores were similar at 6 and 12 months after
acute myocardial infarction between patients who did and did not
participate in cardiac rehabilitation.
Meaning Increased use of validated health status outcome
measures are needed to further examine if and how health status
can be maximized for participants in cardiac rehabilitation after
acute myocardial infarction.

interviews, patients were asked if they had attended and par-
ticipated in a CR program since hospitalization for their “heart
attack or heart problem.
” CR participants were defined as those
who confirmed participating in a CR program (minimum of
1session)within6monthsofhospitaldischargefollowingAMI.
Health Status Assessment
Patients’health status was assessed at baseline and at each fol-
low-upinterviewusingtheSeattleAnginaQuestionnaire(SAQ)
and the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). The SAQ is
a validated, disease-specific instrument consisting of 19 items
that measure 5 clinically relevant domains of health status in
patients with coronary artery disease.12 For our analysis, the
following 4 domains were included: QoL, angina frequency
(AF), treatment satisfaction (TS), and physical limitation (PL).
Domain scores range from 0 to 100, with lower scores indi-
cating poorer health status (eg, more angina, more limitation
in physical activities owing to angina, and poorer QoL). Prior
work has suggested that a change of approximately 5 points
in the SAQ QoL, AF, TS, and PL domain scores is clinically
significant.12,13TheSF-12isagenerichealthstatusmeasurecon-
sisting of 12 items derived to provide overall summary scales
of the 36-Item Short-Form Survey physical component sum-
maryandmentalcomponentsummary.14Scoringisnormbased
and standardized to a mean (SD) of 50 (10), with lower scores
indicating poorer health status.
Outcomes
The primary outcomes of interest were the mean differences
in SAQ QoL, AF, TS, and PL domain scores at 6 and 12 months
after hospital discharge between patients who did and did not
participate in CR. Secondary outcomes of interest were the
mean differences in the SF-12 physical component summary
and mental component summary scores and all-cause mor-
tality (up to 7 years after AMI). Mortality was determined
through follow-up interviews and querying the Social Secu-
rity Death Index.
Statistical Analysis
Data analysis was performed from 2014 to 2015. We first mea-
sured the distribution of baseline patient characteristics be-
tweenpatientswhodidanddidnotparticipateinCRusingstan-
dardized differences, defined as the mean difference between
groups divided by the pooled SD of the 2 groups. This mea-
sure of distribution is not as sensitive to sample size as tradi-
tional tests and provides a sense of the relative magnitude of
differences, with a standardized difference of more than 10%
typically considered to represent a meaningful imbalance.15
Next, to ensure an appropriate balance of patient character-
istics between groups before comparing outcomes, we de-
rived propensity scores for the likelihood of participating in
CR within 6 months of hospital discharge after AMI. We con-
structed nonparsimonious logistic regression models using 45
variables to examine the likelihood of participation in CR.9,16,17
Explanatoryvariablesincludedinthepropensitymodel(Table)
were among larger conceptual domains that occurred before
hospital discharge (and before the opportunity to participate
in CR) and that were hypothesized to potentially be associ-
ated with participation in CR. These variables included demo-
graphic,psychosocial,andsocioeconomiccharacteristics;clini-
cal status at presentation; comorbidities; revascularization
during hospitalization for AMI; new events during hospital-
ization for AMI; health status at time of AMI; and medica-
tionsprescribedathospitaldischarge.Multipleimputationdata
setswerecreatedtohandlemissingpatientvariableswhencon-
structing the propensity scores. We then conservatively
matched (caliper width of 0.2 times the pooled SD of the logit
propensity score) patients participating and not participating
in CR by using an optimal strategy allowing many-to-many
matching.18 After matching, standardized differences of all co-
variates were calculated to ensure that each was less than 10%,
indicating an adequate balance of covariate distribution be-
tween groups. For the analysis of health status outcomes, we
used a linear mixed-effects model to estimate the mean dif-
ference of SAQ and SF-12 scores at 6 and 12 months between
propensity-matched patients participating and not participat-
ing in CR. This model allowed for the incorporation of all eli-
gible patients with baseline and follow-up health status scores
at 6 or 12 months while assessing for interactions between
groups and time. Mortality differences (up to 7 years after AMI)
betweenpropensity-matchedpairsofpatientsparticipatingand
not participating in CR were examined using a Cox propor-
tional hazards regression model to estimate hazard rates.
To examine the robustness of our findings associated with
health status outcomes from our primary analysis, we con-
ducted several additional sensitivity analyses. First, to assess
foranysurvivorbias,patientswhodiedwithinthefirstyearand
did not have health status data from the 6- or 12-month fol-
low-up were included (n = 420) and assigned a score of zero
(worstpossiblescore)forallSAQandSF-12domainscoresatthat
time. Second, for evaluation of any bias resulting from exclud-
ingsurvivingpatientswhoweremissinghealthstatusdatafrom
the 6- and 12-month follow-up, we used inverse probability
weighting. We first compared the characteristics of the ana-
lytic cohort vs living patients excluded owing to missing health
status data from the 6- and 12-month follow-up (n = 1094). A
logistic regression model was then constructed in which pa-
tientswereweightedontheinverseoftheprobabilitytobemiss-
ing health status data from the 6- and 12-month follow-up so
astoenablegreaterweightintheoutcomestopatientswhowere
most like those who were living but missing health status data
from the follow-up. Last, to examine for any potential selec-
tion bias associated with referral to CR, we reran our primary
analysisafterrestrictingouranalyticcohorttoonlypatientswho
werereferredtoCR(n = 3957).Theresultsofallsensitivityanaly-
ses were comparable with those from our original analysis, so
only the primary analysis is reported. All analyses were con-

seeking health care owing to cost less often (14.7% vs 25.1%)
and were generally healthier than those who did not partici-
pate in CR, with fewer participants having a prior MI (14.8%
vs 23.3%) or history of smoking (55.4% vs 62.2%).
Although the standardized differences for all mean base-
line SAQ and SF-12 scores were greater than 10%, only the stan-
dardized difference of the SAQ PL score between patients who
did and did not participate in CR was clinically significant (≥5
points),withparticipantshavingamean(SD)higherscore(90.5
[17.4] vs 83.4 [24.2]; standardized difference, 33.7%). During
the year after AMI, the mean health status scores of patients
who did and did not participate in CR improved in all do-
mains except for SAQ TS, with small differences observed be-
tween groups (Figure 2 and eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
Propensity-Matched Health Status Scores
and Mortality Analyses
After using propensity score methods to assemble a matched
cohort of patients who participated in CR with characteristics
similar to those who did not participate, 3 participants and 20
nonparticipants were unable to be matched and were ex-
cluded from further analyses (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
The distribution of observed patient characteristics were simi-
lar between the matched cohort of patients who participated
in CR (n = 2012) and those who did not participate (n = 2894),
as all standardized differences were less than 10% (eFigure 3
in the Supplement).
In the propensity score–matched analysis of health sta-
tus outcomes, mean SAQ QoL, AF, TS, and PL scores at 6 and
12 months were clinically similar for both patients who par-
ticipated in CR and those who did not participate. Although
mean SAQ AF scores at 6 months were statistically signifi-
cantly higher in those who did not participate than in CR pa-
tients who did participate (between-group difference, 1.53
points), this difference was well below the generally ac-
cepted threshold of clinical importance (≥5 points). For ge-
neric health status measurement, mean SF-12 physical com-
ponent summary and mental component summary scores at
6 and 12 months were also similar (Figure 3). The results of the
sensitivityanalysesexaminingforanyreferral,survivor,orloss
to follow-up bias were comparable with the above results. In
the analysis of all-cause mortality during 7 years of follow-up
in the propensity-matched patients who did and did not par-
ticipate in CR, the participants had a 41% lower hazard rate of
mortality compared with nonparticipants (hazard rate, 0.59;
95% CI, 0.46-0.75) (Figure 4).
Discussion
In 4929 patients with AMI across 31 US centers, we found that,
on average, both those who participated in at least 1 CR ses-
sion and those who did not participate had improvements in
their disease-specific and overall health status during the 12
months after hospital discharge. After propensity matching,

cally differ between groups, the hazard rate of long-term mor-
tality was 41% lower in patients who participated in CR. To our

knowledge, this is the largest effectiveness study to examine
the association between CR and health status outcomes in pa-
tients after AMI.
Although many studies have examined the effect of CR on
morbidity and mortality in patients after AMI,4,19,20 only a lim-
ited number of studies have examined the effect of CR on
health status using validated instruments, with most using ge-
nericmeasures.Forinstance,among63trialsincludedina2016
Cochrane review of exercise-based CR in patients with coro-
nary artery disease, most of whom had experienced AMI, only
20 trials used a validated health status measure.21 Although
most of these studies found an improvement in health status
scores in both the treatment and control arms, the significant
heterogeneity in the measuring and reporting of QoL pre-
cluded the Cochrane Collaborative from performing a meta-
analysis of the health status benefits of CR.
Among the 20 trials that used validated health status
measures, only 3 studies in the post-AMI setting used disease-
specific measures with heterogeneity in the type of interven-
tion.Thefirst,astudybyOldridgeetal,22usedtheinterviewer-
administered Quality of Life after Myocardial Infarction
questionnaire and found similar emotional and physical limi-
tationdomainscoresat4,8,and12monthsin201patientswith
AMI who were randomized to 8 weeks of CR or usual care. The
second, a multicenter Australian study by Heller et al,23 used
theMacNewHeartDiseaseHealth-RelatedQualityofLifeques-
tionnaire, the self-administered modification of the Quality of
Life after Myocardial Infarction questionnaire, in 450 pa-
tients with AMI who were randomized to usual care or an in-
tervention, which consisted of education on diet and exer-
cise; they found that the intervention group had statistically
higheremotionaldomainscoresatthe6-monthfollow-upcom-
pared with patients who received usual care (5.4 vs 5.2;
P = .04), although the mean difference of 0.2 points between
groups is not considered clinically significant. Last, a China-
based study by Wang et al24 used the Chinese Myocardial In-
farction Dimensional Assessment Scale25,26 to assess disease-
specific QoL in 160 patients with AMI from 2 centers who were
randomized to receive home-based CR, consisting of a self-
help manual, or usual care. Although the study did find sta-
tistically significant higher scores in 3 of 7 domains in those
who participated in CR at the 6-month follow-up, the point dif-
ferences between groups were only 4.2, 4.9, and 8.3 points in
the domains of dependency, physical activity, and concern re-
garding medications, respectively, and the clinical signifi-
cance of these differences is not known. Our findings, al-
though observational, expand prior work by examining the
association between CR and health status outcomes using
well-accepted measures of disease-specific and generic health
status in a much larger contemporary, real-world cohort of
patients with AMI.
Only 2 prior observational studies have used the SAQ to
examine the effect of CR on health status in patients with coro-
nary artery disease; however, neither study was conducted ex-
clusively in the post-AMI setting. The first, by Goss et al,27 was
a prospective, observational multicenter study examining the
association between participation in CR and health status in
691 patients during 12 months after coronary artery bypass
grafting surgery. This 13-center study conducted in Washing-
ton state found that the SAQ and 36-Item Short-Form Survey
domain scores improved for all patients 1 year after coronary
artery bypass grafting surgery independent of participation in
CR. Tavella and Beltrame28 conducted a smaller, more con-
temporary prospective, single-center Australian study that ex-
amined the effect of participation in CR on health status in 150
patients with coronary artery disease for 6 months following
coronary angiography. They found that all patients had im-
provements in SAQ and 36-Item Short-Form Survey domain

scoresindependentofparticipationinCR.Ourfindingsofcom-
parable changes in disease-specific and generic health status
of both patients who did and did not participate in CR are simi-
lar to the results of these 2 studies, although our analyses fo-
cused exclusively on patients with a recent AMI.
Although improvement in health status is a commonly
cited benefit of participation in CR after AMI,8,9 our results and
prior work underscore the paucity of data to support this
statement.3,5 Much of the uncertainty surrounding this asso-
ciation is owing to the lack of adequately powered, high-
quality studies capturing the type, intensity, and frequency of
CR while using validated, disease-specific health status mea-
sures. Despite no differences in health status, the association
of participation in CR with survival after an AMI, and the re-
ported underuse of CR,16 are compelling reasons to refer pa-
tients to, and ensure their participation in, CR. Nevertheless,
it is important that patients are provided with accurate, evi-
dence-based information that CR is associated with better sur-
vivalbutnotbetterhealthstatus,giventhatpriorworkhassug-
gested that many patients primarily expect improvement in
health status from participation in CR.29-32 Moreover, future
work should explore whether or not the type, intensity, fre-
quency, duration, or any other additional components of CR
mayimprovehealthstatus,asimprovedanginacontrolandbet-
ter QoL are primary goals of treatment after AMI. Our find-
ings also underscore the need for increased use of validated
cardiovascular health status measures in both clinical stud-
ies and the real-world setting to provide opportunities to fur-
ther examine if and how these patient-centered outcomes can
be maximized for patients who participate in CR.
Our study findings should be interpreted in the context of
potential limitations. First, participation in CR was self-
reportedusingstructuredfollow-upinterviews,andwedidnot
verify patients’reported participation at each site. However,
prior work found a nearly perfect agreement between self-
reported and site-verified participation in CR.33 Second, we did
not capture the type, intensity, frequency, and length of pa-
tients’participation in CR. However, our results are similar to
thoseofpriorrandomizedclinicaltrialsandobservationalstud-
ies using disease-specific health status measures.22,27,28,34
Moreover, our demonstration of a survival benefit with par-
ticipation in CR, similar to that in prior studies, further sup-
ports our characterization of participation in CR, given our rep-
lication of the previously established benefits of this
intervention.3Nevertheless,futureresearcheffortsmaybeable
to better quantify the quantity and quality of participation in
CR and identify a dose-response association that was missed
with our crude categorization of participation. Third, the 2
groups in our analytic cohort had significant baseline differ-
ences in several characteristics, and while we were able to suc-
cessfully match our cohorts using propensity-based methods
in addition to several sensitivity analyses, we cannot exclude
unmeasured confounding.
Conclusions
In a large, contemporary, multicenter cohort of 4929 patients
with AMI, we found that patients who did and did not partici-
pate in CR had similar disease-specific and generic health sta-
tus during the year following hospital discharge; however, par-
ticipation in CR did confer a significant survival benefit. Our
results underscore the need for further investigation of the ef-
fect of participation in CR on health status to identify if and
how CR programs can better maximize health status out-
comes for patients after AMI.
