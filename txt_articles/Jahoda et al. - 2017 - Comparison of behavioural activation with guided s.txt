Summary
Background Psychological therapies are first-line interventions for depression, but existing provision is not accessible 
for many adults with intellectual disabilities. We investigated the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a behavioural 
activation intervention (BeatIt) for people with intellectual disabilities and depression. BeatIt was compared with a 
guided self-help intervention (StepUp).
Methods We did a multicentre, single-blind, randomised, controlled trial with follow-up at 4 months and 12 months 
after randomisation. Participants aged 18 years or older, with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities and clinically 
significant depression were recruited from health and social care services in the UK. The primary outcome was the 
Glasgow Depression Scale for people with a Learning Disability (GDS-LD) score at 12 months. Analyses were done on 
an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with ISCRTN, number ISRCTN09753005.
Findings Between Aug 8, 2013, and Sept 1, 2015, 161 participants were randomly assigned (84 to BeatIt; 77 to StepUp); 
141 (88%) participants completed the trial. No group differences were found in the effects of BeatIt and StepUp based 
on GDS-LD scores at 12 months (12·03 [SD 7·99] GDS-LD points for BeatIt vs 12·43 [SD 7·64] GDS-LD points for 
StepUp; mean difference 0·26 GDS-LD points [95% CI –2·18 to 2·70]; p=0·833). Within-group improvements in 
GDS-LD scores occurred in both groups at 12 months (BeatIt, mean change –4·2 GDS-LD points [95% CI –6·0 to –2·4], 
p<0·0001; StepUp, mean change –4·5 GDS-LD points [–6·2 to –2·7], p<0·0001), with large effect sizes (BeatIt, 0·590 
[95% CI 0·337–0·844]; StepUp, 0·627 [0·380–0·873]). BeatIt was not cost-effective when compared with StepUp, 
although the economic analyses indicated substantial uncertainty. Treatment costs were only approximately 3·6–6·8% 
of participants’ total support costs. No treatment-related or trial-related adverse events were reported.
Interpretation This study is, to our knowledge, the first large randomised controlled trial assessing individual 
psychological interventions for people with intellectual disabilities and mental health problems. These findings show 
that there is no evidence that BeatIt is more effective than StepUp; both are active and potentially effective 
interventions.

Introduction
Individuals with intellectual disabilities have higher rates 
of mental ill health than the general population, with a 
point prevalence of 40% for adults.1 The term intellectual 
disabilities refers to people who have substantial 
impairments of both intellectual and functional ability, 
with age of onset before adulthood. Approximately 2% of 
adults and 3·5% of children have an intelligence quotient 
(IQ) of less than 70, although this figure might be rising 
because of increasing life expectancy, improving survival 
outcomes of babies with very low birthweight, and 
increasing maternal age.2
Depression is as common in adults with intellectual 
disabilities as in the general population, with a point 
prevalence of about 5%.1 The disorder is more enduring 
for these adults than for the general population, 
suggesting it is either a more severe condition or more 
poorly managed than in the general population. For 
example, a study with a British cohort found that adults 
with intellectual disabilities were four times more likely 
than the non-intellectually disabled population to meet 
criteria for chronic depression over a 28-year period.3
Although 
psychological 
therapies 
have 
become 
established first-line interventions for depression in the 
general population, this has not been the case for adults 
with intellectual disabilities, because of the additional 
complexities involved in making these interventions 
accessible to adults with cognitive and verbal com-
munication impairments. Awareness of the inequity in 
provision of psychological therapies has grown, but 
substantial limitations remain in the existing evidence 
base and in its implementation. The available literature 
was reviewed for the National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence (NICE) guideline4 on mental health 
problems in people with intellectual disabilities. A key 
recommendation was for modifi 
cations to and trials of

psychological interventions to ensure they are accessible 
to adults with intellectual disabilities.
In behavioural activation, the focus of the intervention 
is on behaviour change rather than cognition, 
emphasising engagement with potential environmental 
reinforcers.5 In the general population, behavioural 
activation has been shown to be as effective as 
antidepressant medications, and superior or equivalent 
to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), pill-placebo, and 
treatment as usual among patients with more severe 
depression,6,7 with effects lasting as long as those for 
CBT following treatment termination.8 Non-specialist 
health-care workers can be trained to deliver behavioural 
activation.6 Although there have been promising 
developments in CBT approaches for people with 
intellectual disabilities, including a recent pilot 
randomised controlled trial of a computerised inter-
vention,9 behavioural activation might be more 
accessible than CBT for people with intellectual 
disabilities, since it is less cognitively demanding. We 
therefore aimed to assess the effectiveness of 
behavioural activation for people with intellectual 
disabilities and depression. The study reported here was 
informed by a pilot open trial of behavioural activation 
alone in people with intellectual disabilities, done at one 
site.10 Outcomes from the pilot study showed evidence 
of a reduction in depressive symptoms for those able to 
self-report on the Glasgow Depression Scale for people 
with a Learning Disability (GDS-LD)11 before and after 
the intervention, and at a 3 month follow-up after the 
end of treatment.
Methods
Study design and participants
We did a multicentre, single-blind, randomised 
controlled trial comparing adapted behavioural activation 
(BeatIt) with guided self-help (StepUp). At the request of 
the funder, the comparator was not treatment as usual. 
We also did an accompanying health economic evaluation 
of the interventions. Nested qualitative studies exploring 
the experiences of participants, supporters, and therapists 
will be reported elsewhere.
An internal pilot phase was done in Scotland before 
opening additional study sites in England and Wales. 
Participants were recruited mostly from specialist 
intellectual disabilities health services (not specifically 
mental health services) and social care services, with 
some recruited from Improving Access to Psychological 
Therapy (IAPT) services in Lancashire. IAPT services 
provide first-line psychological interventions for all 
adults in England with mental health problems. 
Inclusion criteria were mild to moderate intellectual 
disabilities, measured by a score of 75 or less on the 
Weschler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence;12 the ability to 
provide informed consent; age 18 years or older; and 
clinically significant depression as assessed by the 
Diagnostic Criteria for Psychiatric Disorders for use with 
Adults with Learning Disabilities.13 Participants also 
needed to have a supporter (a staff member, family 
member, or friend) who could provide support in therapy 
sessions. Participants who were actively suicidal or 
having difficulties that would prevent them from 
interacting with the therapist or retaining information 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
In September, 2016, a review for the UK National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline for mental 
health problems in people with learning disabilities reported 
that the only available evidence on psychological interventions 
for depression in people with intellectual disabilities was for 
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), adapted for people with 
intellectual disabilities. Of 130 studies identified in that review, 
three randomised controlled trials and three controlled 
before-and-after studies investigated CBT for treatment or 
prevention of depression in adults with intellectual disabilities. 
NICE concluded that CBT might result in a clinically meaningful 
reduction in depressive symptoms when compared with 
treatment as usual at a follow-up of 38 weeks, but graded the 
evidence as being of very low quality.
Added value of this study
This study is, to our knowledge, the largest randomised 
controlled trial of individual psychological therapy for adults 
with intellectual disabilities published to date. Participants were 
successfully recruited and randomly assigned to receive 
manualised individual psychological therapies for depression. 
Participant retention was 88%, and therapies were delivered 
with excellent fidelity to the manuals. Significant reductions in 
depression scores were apparent by the end of treatment for 
both BeatIt and StepUp, and were maintained at 12 months 
after randomisation. Neither treatment was better than the 
other. The long-term nature of the follow-up period 
(12 months after randomisation) and the health economic 
analysis of the psychological interventions also make important 
contributions to the existing scientific literature.
Implications of all the available evidence
High-quality randomised controlled trials of individual 
psychological therapies can be done in adults with intellectual 
disabilities and mental health problems such as depression. 
Psychological interventions such as behavioural activation and 
guided self-help can be manualised and used as first-line 
interventions for adults with intellectual disabilities and 
depression. Moreover, health-care workers can be trained and 
supervised to deliver behavioural activation and guided 
self-help as part of their regular practice, without requiring 
specialist therapists.

from sessions (eg, late-stage dementia), were excluded. 
Those participating in the trial did not receive another 
psychological therapy for depression while they were 
receiving either BeatIt or StepUp.
Information was provided and presentations were 
made to health and social care services about the trial. 
Professionals identified individuals they were working 
with who might be suitable and passed on details of the 
study, with advice to talk through the information with a 
support person of their choosing, since potential 
participants had few, if any, literacy skills. The researcher 
then arranged to meet with those who replied, ordinarily 
alongside a support person, and talked through the 
information sheet. If the participant was satisfied with 
the researcher’s answers to any questions they had, they 
were invited to choose whether or not they would like to 
take part in the study. The West of Scotland Research 
Ethics Committee 3 gave national approval for the study 
(NRES: 13/MH97). The full trial protocol has been 
published.14
Randomisation and masking
Participants who gave written informed consent (they 
were asked to sign the consent form and their signature 
was witnessed by a carer or someone independent of the 
study) were screened and provided baseline data before 
being randomly assigned. Individuals were allocated in a 
1:1 ratio to receive the BeatIt or StepUp intervention, by 
use of block randomisation. Mixed block sizes of length 
four and six were used at random. Randomisation was 
stratified by study centre and use of antidepressants. 
Changes in the prescription of antidepressants and other 
mood-stabilising drugs were monitored for the duration 
of the study.
To conceal the allocation of participants from the 
research team, each participant was randomly assigned 
to a treatment group by use of an automated system run 
by the Robertson Centre for Biostatistics (University of 
Glasgow, Glasgow, UK). The system did not reveal the 
random allocation to the researcher but notified the 
study coordinator, who then contacted clinicians to 
arrange 
subsequent 
treatment 
visits. 
Thus, 
the 
researchers collecting outcome data remained unaware 
of the intervention group to which participants had been 
assigned. Processes were in place to ensure researchers 
continued to be unaware of participants’ designations 
over the course of their involvement in the trial. On the 
two occasions that researchers were unmasked, both 
during the process of arranging data collection, the 
participants were reassigned to another researcher.
Procedures
The BeatIt intervention was a 12-session manualised 
approach15 based on a published protocol and carefully 
adapted and successfully piloted in people with 
intellectual disabilities. The focus of the intervention was 
on increasing activity, scheduling activity, and addressing 
barriers to achieving engagement in activity. The 
first stage of therapy involved obtaining an insight into 
the participant’s pattern of life and sharing a formulation 
of their difficulties linked to the underpinning theory of 
behavioural activation, before working to increase the 
participant’s engagement and overcome emotional and 
organisational barriers to change. Therapy ended with a 
plan to maintain or continue progress.
The eight-session guided self-help intervention, 
StepUp,16 was chosen as the comparator because it was 
deemed similar to BeatIt in terms of therapist attention, 
use of a structured, manualised approach, and the 
presence of a supporter. The self-help materials had been 
developed before the study by a member of the research 
team. StepUp was thought to differ from BeatIt in 
relation to the active components of the intervention, 
which were perceived to be less person-centred and 
essentially psychoeducational. After building rapport in 
the first session, a series of four booklets provided a 
focus for the next five sessions. The booklets concerned 
depression and factors linked to low mood, sleep, 
physical activity, and problem solving. Therapy finished 
with a review of all booklets and then a final session 
making a plan for their continued use.
In addition to ensuring that the materials and exercises 
from both interventions were accessible and engaging, a 
key adaptation was delivery of the therapy alongside a 
support person. These were individuals who were able to 
provide support in sessions and who were therefore 
available for a minimum of 2 h per week. For BeatIt, 
people with intellectual disabilities ordinarily relied on 
others for support to engage in activity and negotiate 
change. Those taking part in StepUp typically needed 
help with understanding the booklets and using them in 
their everyday lives. The involvement of supporters also 
ensured that participants had help to maintain 
therapeutic gains once the interventions had finished.
Both interventions were delivered on an outreach basis, 
by community nurses and allied health professionals 
with experience of working with people who have 
intellectual disabilities. Some IAPT workers were also 
involved. All therapists received 1–2 days of training in 
the delivery of the intervention and were supervised by 
clinical psychologists. All therapists were asked, where 
possible, to record two sessions selected by the trial 
coordinator, for the purpose of establishing fidelity to the 
manual and quality of therapy delivery.
Outcomes
The primary outcome measure was the GDS-LD score11 
at 12 months after randomisation. Secondary outcomes 
included 
carer 
ratings 
of 
depressive 
symptoms 
(Intellectual Disabilities Depression Scale; IDDS)17 and 
aggressive behaviour (Behaviour Problems Inventory 
short form; BPI-S),18 along with self-reporting of anxiety 
symptoms (Glasgow Anxiety Scale for people with 
Intellectual Disabilities; GAS-ID).19 Quality of life was

also examined (EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire; 
EQ-5D-Y),20 along with community involvement (Index 
of Community Involvement; ICI),21 domestic activity 
(Index of Participation in Domestic Life; IPDL),22 and 
perceived social support (Social Support Questionnaire; 
SSQ3).23 Four subscales of the Adaptive Behavior Scale 
(ABS)24 were completed. Carer self-efficacy was examined 
with the Emotional Difficulties Self-Efficacy Scale 
(EDSE).25 Primary and secondary outcome measures 
were collected at baseline, 4 months, and 12 months after 
randomisation. Service use data (reported in the cost 
analysis) were collected from carers at 4 months and 
12 months, and also at 8 months. Participants’ life events 
were recorded (Bangor Life Events Schedule for 
Intellectual Disabilities; BLESID)26 at baseline and 
12 months only, as the BLESID records events that occur 
during a 12-month period.
Statistical analysis
In the first 18 months of an open trial of BeatIt,10 the 
mean reduction in GDS-LD scores at a 3 month follow-up 
after the intervention was 8·50 points (SD 5·24). Our 
study was powered to detect a mean between-group 
difference of 0·60 SD units or 3·14 points on the 
GDS-LD.
If the BeatIt group in the present study could achieve 
an 8·50-point improvement in GDS-LD scores at 
12 months, then this outcome would allow for the 
StepUp group to show a 5·36-point improvement during 
the same time period (ie, 63% of the improvement in the 
BeatIt group). Alternatively, this outcome allowed for 
detection of a small improvement in the StepUp group 
in conjunction with a large, short-term improvement in 
the BeatIt group, followed by some regression. For 
example, if the BeatIt group showed an improvement 
from baseline to 12 months of 6·00 points, then the 
study would be powered to detect a difference if the mean 
improvement in the StepUp group was 2·86 points.
To have 90% power to detect this difference, this study 
required 60 participants in each group to provide 
outcome data at 12 months after randomisation. The 
primary analysis was an analysis of covariance adjusting 
for baseline GDS-LD score, which should have the same 
power to detect smaller intervention effects, depending 
on the level of correlation in scores over time.
There were no data to inform the effect of clustering of 
outcomes for participants with intellectual disabilities 
seen by each therapist. We assumed that each therapist 
would work with an average of nine participants 
(ie, several part-time therapists at each site) and we 
assumed an intraclass correlation of 0·025, resulting in 
the sample size being increased by 20% to 72 per group,

or 144 in total. A recruitment target of 166 participants 
allowed for up to 13·3% of participants to be lost to 
follow-up.
The primary analysis compared GDS-LD scores at 
12 months after randomisation between intervention 
groups, adjusting for baseline GDS-LD scores, study 
centre, and use of antidepressants at baseline as fixed 
effects within a mixed-effects linear regression model, 
including random intercepts for therapists. Similar 
methods were applied to the primary outcome measure 
at the immediate assessment after the intervention 
(4 months after randomisation) and to secondary 
outcome measures at each assessment point. These 
models were used to estimate between-group differences 
and within-group changes from baseline. Intraclass 
correlation coefficients were estimated as the ratio of the 
between-therapist variance to the sum of between-
therapist and residual variance from these models. 
Additionally, for each outcome measure, data from both 
follow-up timepoints were analysed simultaneously by 
use of repeated measures models, adjusting for the 
baseline value of the outcome, stratification factors, and 
timepoint as fixed effects, with random intercepts for 
therapists 
and 
participants; 
intervention-by-time 
interactions were used to test whether any between-
group differences varied over time.
Analyses of the primary outcome were repeated with 
multiple imputation to assess whether the results were 
sensitive to missing data. To impute missing values at 
each timepoint, prediction models were based on age, 
antidepressant use, and any previous or subsequent 
measurements of the primary outcome; these prediction 
models did not include randomised group. Models for 
the primary outcome were extended to explore the effects 
of baseline characteristics, including stratification 
factors, chronicity of depressive symptoms, life events, 
and history of previous psychological intervention. These 
models were extended with interaction terms, to assess 
whether between-group differences varied by subgroup. 
Selected analyses were repeated in a per-protocol 
population of participants who attended at least eight 
BeatIt therapy sessions or at least six StepUp sessions. 
For the economic analyses, a UK National Health 
Service (NHS) and personal social services perspective 
was taken.27 Hospital and community resource use was 
collected with the Client Service Receipt Inventory 
questionnaire (CSRI).28 The CSRI was adapted, on the 
basis of a similar previous study for a population with 
learning disabilities, in conjunction with the clinical 
team.29 Data on therapist and supervisor time incurred 
and mileage travelled were collected by use of timesheets. 
Information on medication use was collected by use of a 
medication inventory. Costs for prescribed medication 
were taken from the British National Formulary (BNF); 
other resource costs were taken from the Personal Social 
Services Research Unit (PSSRU) Unit Costs,30 NHS 
reference costs,27 and other relevant literature.29 The costs 
of intervention materials were obtained from the 
research team. Resources were valued at 2015 costs in 
pounds sterling, and any costs that needed uplifting (ie, 
adjusting for inflation) were adjusted by use of the 
Hospital and Community Health Services (HCHS) 
index.31 We measured effectiveness in terms of 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), via the EQ-5D-Y.20

and older and is adapted directly from the EQ-5D-3L 
with simplified wording. Since no youth-specific tariff
 
values exist, adult tariffs were used.32 Patient-specific 
QALYs were estimated from the utility measurements at 
each follow-up point assuming linear interpolation.
Cost-effectiveness was assessed by use of the cost-
utility approach,33 with the difference in mean cost and 
QALYs between groups compared with regression 
techniques. Multiple imputaion with chained equations 
was used to handle missing data34 and uncertainty 
handled 
by 
bootstrapping 
1000 
non-parametric 
resamples with results presented on the cost-
effectiveness plane and cost-effectiveness acceptability 
curve. All analyses were done with Stata, version 14.0.
This trial is registered with ISCRTN, number 
ISRCTN09753005.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation or writing of 
the report. AJ, AM, and RZ had full access to all the data 
in the study, and AJ had final responsibility for the 
decision to submit for publication.
Results
Between Aug 8, 2013, and Sept 1, 2015, 161 participants 
were recruited and randomly assigned: 84 to BeatIt and 
77 to StepUp (figure 1). Of these, 68 (81%) BeatIt and 
73 (95%) StepUp participants completed the trial by 
providing data at the primary endpoint. 56 (67%) BeatIt 
participants and 59 (77%) StepUp participants completed 
therapy as defined per protocol. BeatIt participants 
attended an average of 9·9 sessions (SD 3·2) and StepUp 
participants an average of 7·1 (2·1). 12 participants 
withdrew from the BeatIt group compared with two 
from the StepUp group. However, three of the 
withdrawals in the BeatIt group happened before 
participants 
started 
therapy 
and 
another 
BeatIt 
participant withdrew when they were contacted for the 
12-month follow-up visit, after the intervention had 
finished.
Participants’ 
characteristics 
were 
well 
balanced 
between the groups at baseline (table 1). The mean full 
scale IQ scores were 55·44 (SD 8·02) for BeatIt 
participants and 58·34 (8·38) for StepUp participants. 
Most participants were receiving support from services 
at least daily and were being prescribed antidepressant 
medication (table 1). 
42 therapists delivered BeatIt and 34 therapists 
delivered StepUp. Most therapists were community 
intellectual disabilities nurses (51 [67%] of 76), were 
experienced in working with people who have intellectual 
disabilities (48 [63%] for 5 years or more), and had 
received some previous therapy training (46 [61%]). The 
mean ratio of sessions to supervisions delivered was 
1·90 (SD 1·36). The expected ratio was 2·00, and a mean 
of less than 2·00 indicates a slightly higher than expected 
level of supervision.
Fidelity recordings were obtained from 44 (52%) of 
84 BeatIt and 49 (63%) of 77 StepUp participants. No

significant differences were observed in baseline scores 
for GDS-LD, IDDS, BPI-S (aggressive behaviour scale), 
and the age or sex of the 93 participants with fidelity 
recordings and of the 68 participants without recordings. 
The scale had a Cronbach’s alpha of 0·76 and a mean 
adjusted item-total correlation of 0·42 (SD 0·10; range 
0·31–0·58). The stability of the fidelity score was 
explored with the first and second fidelity ratings for the 
51 participants with two recordings. The first fidelity 
rating for these participants had a mean score of 33·6 
(SD 3·6) and the second rating had a mean score of 
33·7 (3·7); this difference was not significant (p=0·89). 
The scores for the first and second ratings were correlated 
(Pearson’s r 0·64, p<0·0001).
Fidelity scores did not differ significantly between the 
two groups (32·3 [SD 4·1] for BeatIt, 33·9 [3·9] for 
StepUp; p=0·13). In terms of fidelity to the manual, 
33 (75%) of 44 BeatIt therapists and 42 (86%) of 49 StepUp 
therapists whose data were included in the fidelity 
assessments obtained maximum scores. Measures of 
therapy quality showed high scores for empathy 
(maximum score 4; BeatIt score 3·55 [SD 0·5]; StepUp 
score 3·61 [0·57]) and warmth (BeatIt score 3·68 [SD 
0·47]; StepUp score 3·61 [0·64]) by both sets of therapists.
Primary and secondary study outcome data at baseline, 
4 months, and 12 months after randomisation and 
estimated between-group differences at follow-up are 
presented in table 2. We found no evidence of a difference 
in treatment effect between BeatIt and StepUp based on 
the GDS-LD scores at 12 months (12·03 GDS-LD points 
[SD 7·99] with BeatIt; 12·43 GDS-LD points [7·64] with 
StepUp; mean difference 0·26 GDS-LD points [95% CI 
–2·18 to 2·70]; p=0·833). Secondary outcomes (table 2) 
were consistent with the findings for the primary 
outcome, with no statistically significant between-group 
differences at 4 months and 12 months. One exception 
was the ABS-socialisation score at 4 months, which was 
lower in the Step-Up group than in the BeatIt group at 
4 months (p=0·017) but similar at 12 months (p=0·750). 
Analyses of GDS-LD scores were repeated with multiple 
imputation for missing outcome data, and analyses of 
primary and secondary outcomes were repeated for the 
per-protocol population. Although the estimates for 
effects changed slightly, the overall pattern of findings 
was similar (appendix).
Compared with baseline, significant improvements in 
the primary outcome were observed for both study 
groups at 4 months (BeatIt, mean change –5·1 GDS-LD 
points [95% CI –6·7 to –3·6], p<0·0001; StepUp, mean 
change –4·4 GDS-LD points [–5·9 to –2·9], p<0·0001) 
and at 12 months (BeatIt, mean change –4·2 GDS-LD 
points [–6·0 to –2·4], p<0·0001; StepUp, mean 
change –4·5 GDS-LD points [–6·2 to –2·7], p<0·0001), 
with large effect sizes, as shown in figure 2. Repeated 
measures analysis found no evidence of a change in 
mean GDS-LD scores between 4 months and 12 months 
(p=0·66), and no evidence of a change in the between-
group difference over time (treatment × time interaction, 
p=0·68). The intraclass correlation observed in the 
primary outcome at 12 months (0·085; table 2) was 
higher than assumed in the sample size calculation. 
However, given the greater number of therapists involved 
in the trial, and the smaller number of participants per 
therapist, the design effect due to clustering was 1·10 
rather than 1·20 according to our initial assumptions, so 
this outcome did not adversely affect the power of the 
study.
This pattern of within-group change was mirrored by 
improvements in secondary measures of emotional 
difficulties and quality of life (IDDS, GAS-ID, and EQ-
5D-Y) for both interventions. Once again, these changes 
were observed at 4 months after the intervention and 
maintained until the 12 month follow-up (table 2).
Carers’ confidence in supporting participants with 
their emotional difficulties (EDSE scores) significantly 
improved for both groups at the 4 month follow-up, after 
the intervention, and was maintained at the 12 month

follow-up (table 2). Finally, the negative effect of life 
events (BLESID) for both groups of participants was also 
reduced at the 12 month follow-up.
No deaths were reported during the course of the 
study. 19 adverse events were reported by 15 participants 
allocated to StepUp and 21 adverse events reported by 
18 allocated to BeatIt. None of the 24 serious adverse 
events were treatment or study related and they were all 
hospital admissions. Four BeatIt and five StepUp 
participants were admitted to a mental health ward, of 
whom two BeatIt and three StepUp participants 
presented with suicidal ideation. One attempted 
overdose was reported during the trial. The participant 
had been randomised but had not started therapy.
For the health economic analysis, missing data were 
less than 5% in both resource use and EQ-5D-Y 
questionnaires. A significant difference in baseline 
utilities between groups favoured StepUp. However, at 
the 4 month and 12 month follow-ups no significant 
difference in utilities was observed. After adjustment for 
missing data and baseline imbalance, the initial QALY 
gain favouring StepUp was reversed to favour BeatIt, 
although 
neither 
result 
was 
significant. 
Mean 
intervention costs differed significantly between groups, 
with BeatIt being around £769 (95% CI £622–917) more 
expensive than StepUp. However, we found no 
significant difference in non-intervention costs or total 
costs (table 3; appendix). The incremental costs for 
StepUp versus BeatIt were £1593 (standard error £1827); 
the incremental adjusted QALYs were –0·002 (standard 
error 0·043); and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
showed that BeatIt dominates (table 3). Although the 
adjusted multiple imputation results suggested that 
BeatIt dominates, the associated 95% CI ranges from 
BeatIt dominating to being dominated by StepUp, 
indicating 
substantial 
uncertainty. 
A 
dominated 
intervention is more costly and less effective than the 
comparator. The only certainty in the results is that the 
BeatIt intervention is more costly than StepUp. Exclusion 
of non-intervention costs and calculation of an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) solely with 
intervention costs for BeatIt compared with StepUp 
results in an ICER of £385 000 per QALY gained (95% CI 
£8000 to dominated), which would not be considered 
cost-effective. The cost-effectiveness plane in figure 3 
shows that incremental costs and QALYs are spread in all 
quadrants, indicating that there is uncertainty in the 
results (see the appendix for the cost-effectiveness 
acceptability curve).

Discussion
We found no evidence of the effectiveness of BeatIt 
compared with StepUp, on primary or secondary 
outcomes. Both interventions were associated with 
significant reductions in depressive symptoms. Within-
group improvements were observed at 4 months after 
randomisation (at the end of treatment) and were 
maintained until the 12-month follow-up. The same 
pattern was found for secondary measures of mental 
health and wellbeing, with moderate to large effect sizes.
Given the similar outcomes for both interventions, it 
was unsurprising that we found no evidence that BeatIt 
is cost-effective when compared with StepUp. No 
differences in resource use were found at 12 months, 
although BeatIt did cost more to deliver than StepUp. 
However, overall, most of the support costs for 
participants in both treatment groups were not related to 
the treatments themselves: intervention costs were 
approximately 3·6–6·8% of total support costs for 
participants.
A key question when interpreting these findings is 
whether the associated improvements in depressive 
symptoms simply reflect spontaneous recovery. The 
background characteristics of study participants indicate 
that many had unsuccessful treatment histories. 
Approximately two thirds of participants in both groups 
were taking antidepressants, and 20% allocated to BeatIt 
and 18% allocated to StepUp had received psychological 
therapy before enrolling in the trial, which suggests that 
these participants might have been at the severe and 
enduring end of the depression spectrum. It is known 
from UK birth cohorts that adults with intellectual 
disabilities have a more severe and enduring pattern of 
depression than the general population.3 Moreover, the 
results of six small pilot trials35–40 of psychological 
interventions for depression in people with mild to 
moderate intellectual disabilities reviewed by NICE27 
reported that for participants receiving treatment as 
usual, in all six studies, there was virtually no change in 
depression scores from baseline to follow-up, including 
up to 11 months after baseline. Consequently, it seems 
unlikely (although it cannot be ruled out) that the marked 
improvements in self-reported depressive symptoms in 
both BeatIt and StepUp groups were due to spontaneous 
recovery of symptoms.
No related serious adverse events were reported for 
either of the intervention groups. Although there were 
few withdrawals overall, there were more from the BeatIt 
group than from StepUp. This difference might, in part, 
reflect the greater number of BeatIt sessions and the 
higher expectations made of BeatIt participants, with the 
aim of supporting participants and supporters to engage 
in scheduled activities between sessions.
This study is, to our knowledge, the first randomised 
controlled trial of behavioural activation for people with 
intellectual disabilities and depression, and provides the 
first data collected about the use of guided self-help in 
this population. This study is also the first large-scale 
randomised controlled trial of any individually delivered 
psychological therapy for a mental health problem in 
people with intellectual disabilities. Overall, the 
successful delivery of the trial refutes a widely held 
contention that it is not possible to recruit people with 
intellectual disabilities into large-scale randomised 
controlled trials of individual psychological therapies.41
The main limitation of the trial was the absence of a 
treatment as usual condition. It might have been more 
difficult to recruit participants and deliver the 
intervention if participants faced the prospect of being

randomly assigned to treatment as usual, especially since 
they were recruited through intermediaries who acted as 
gatekeepers, seeking help for those they support or those 
with whom they work. One of the main reasons a guided 
self-help intervention was selected as the comparison 
group was because it was seen as a less person-centred 
and more rigid psychoeducational approach than BeatIt, 
with a different set of active components from 
behavioural activation. What was not anticipated was the 
ability of therapists to personalise the materials, as 
highlighted in the strong fidelity scores for non-specific 
therapy factors, and the agency shown by the participants 
and their supporters to follow through on ideas and 
plans made in therapy sessions, as suggested in the 
nested qualitative studies to be reported elsewhere. 
A potential limitation of the trial was the differential 
follow-up rate in the two randomised groups (81% for 
BeatIt vs 95% for StepUp). Some baseline characteristics 
were associated with dropout (eg, female sex, higher 
IPDL scores, higher ABS [responsibility] scores), but 
none of these characteristics translated into significant 
baseline differences between randomised groups for 
those with follow-up data (table 2). With the exception of 
EQ-5D-Y, we did not observe any between-group 
differences for study outcome measures at baseline, for 
those included in either the intention-to-treat or per-
protocol analyses, and all analyses were adjusted for 
baseline values of the outcome being analysed, so 
differential follow-up is unlikely to have biased our 
results to a substantial degree.
In conclusion, the lessons learned from this study have 
important implications for the conduct of future trials of 
psychological therapies involving people with intellectual 
disabilities. The successful delivery of this trial, carried out 
in existing services, shows the possibility of training 
professional groups, who are already working with people 
who have intellectual disabilities and depression, to deliver 
focused psychological interventions such as behavioural 
activation and guided self-help. This implementation work 
is a priority and might help to address the inequities faced 
by people with intellectual disabilities, who often do not 
have access to psychological therapies for commonly 
occurring mental health problems.
