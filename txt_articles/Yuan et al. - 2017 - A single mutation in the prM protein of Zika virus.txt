Zika virus (ZIKV) has evolved into a global health threat because of its unexpected causal link
to microcephaly. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that contemporary epidemic strains have
accumulated multiple substitutions from their Asian ancestor. Here we show that a single
serine-to-asparagine substitution [Ser139→Asn139 (S139N)] in the viral polyprotein substantially
increased ZIKV infectivity in both human and mouse neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and led
to more severe microcephaly in the mouse fetus, as well as higher mortality rates in neonatal
mice. Evolutionary analysis indicates that the S139N substitution arose before the 2013
outbreak in French Polynesia and has been stably maintained during subsequent spread to
the Americas. This functional adaption makes ZIKV more virulent to human NPCs, thus
contributing to the increased incidence of microcephaly in recent ZIKV epidemics.
Z
ika virus (ZIKV) was first isolated from a
sentinel monkey from Uganda’s Zika forest
in 1947 and, until its recent emergence in
the Americas, was known as an obscure
mosquito-borne flavivirus (1). In the decades
following its discovery, sporadic human ZIKV in-
fections with mild signs and symptoms were
reported in a few countries in Africa and South-
east Asia. After several explosive outbreaks in
Micronesia in 2007 and French Polynesia in 2013–
2014, ZIKV rapidly swept through South and
Central America in 2015. Early in 2016, the World
Health Organization declared the current ZIKV
epidemics a public health emergency of interna-
tional concern, owing to the unexpected causal
link to congenital brain abnormalities, especially
microcephaly, during pregnancy (2, 3). Investiga-
tions with clinical materials and animal models
have provided solid evidence that ZIKV directly
targets neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs), leading
to microcephaly as well as other severe patho-
logical outcomes (4–9).
ZIKV contains a positive-sense 11-kb genome
RNA that encodes three structural proteins (C,
prM, and E) and seven nonstructural proteins.
ZIKV strains can be divided into the African and
Asian lineages (10), and the contemporary strains
circulating in Pacific islands and the Americas
are likely to have evolved from a common an-
cestral strain in Southeast Asia (11). However,
there is serological evidence that ZIKV had been
circulating in Southeast Asia for many years
(10, 12). Why was microcephaly not recognized
earlier? Besides the potential impact of herd im-
munity and the lack of diagnostics and surveil-
lance in epidemic areas, one plausible hypothesis
is that ZIKV has acquired some adaptive muta-
tions to become more virulent to the human fetal
brain. Some preliminary results from cell lines
indicate strain-specific effects in ZIKV-infected
cells (13, 14). Whether contemporary ZIKV strains
are more likely to cause severe microcephaly in
the fetus remains an open question.
We first investigated the in vivo neurovirulence
phenotypes of three contemporary ZIKV strains
(MTQ/2015, VEN/2016, and SAM/2016) isolated
in 2015–2016 (6, 15, 16) and compared them with
the phenotypes of their Asian ancestral strain
(CAM/2010) isolated in Cambodia in 2010 (17).
We used one-day-old neonatal mice, as this stage
of development is analogous to the second tri-
mester of pregnancy in humans. Upon intra-
cerebral injection (18, 19), all three contemporary
strains led to 100% mortality in neonatal mice,
with typical neurological manifestations such as
inactivity, motor weakness, and bilateral hind
limb paralysis. By contrast, CAM/2010 killed only
16.7% animals (Fig. 1A). Nevertheless, in vitro cell
culture–based studies revealed that the contem-
porary strain VEN/2016 showed similar growth
and plaque characteristics to those of CAM/2010
(fig. S1). These results show that the contempo-
rary strains of ZIKV are more neurovirulent in
mice than their ancestral strain CAM/2010.
To determine whether the observed neuro-
virulence phenotype is directly associated with
microcephaly, we further compared the contem-
porary and ancestral strains in an established
mouse embryonic microcephaly model (4). Lit-
termate brains were infected with the two ZIKV
strains at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5), which cor-
responds to infection at the first trimester of
pregnancy in humans, a time point that is as-
sociated with the development of fetal brain ab-
normalities (20). Inspection of the mice at E18.5
revealed that VEN/2016 infection resulted in
brains exhibiting a substantial degree of micro-
cephaly (Fig. 1B), including cortical thinning (Fig.
1C and fig. S2A). The microcephaly phenotype
caused by VEN/2016 is comparable to our pre-
vious findings (4) for another contemporary
ZIKV strain, SAM/2016. By contrast, CAM/2010
caused less severe symptoms. Although both
viruses predominantly targeted the NPCs as
described previously (4), VEN/2016 showed sig-
nificantly enhanced replication in the brain com-
pared with CAM/2010 (fig. S2, B and C). This
result was further verified in primary cultured
mouse NPCs (mNPCs) (fig. S2D). Specifically,
in comparison with CAM/2010, VEN/2016 in-
duced more apoptosis (cells positive for the ac-
tivated form of caspase 3) in different regions
of the brain, as well as the loss of more mature
and immature neurons (neurons positive for
NeuN and Tbr1, respectively) (fig. S3). Further-
more, we found that VEN/2016 disturbed the
proliferation and differentiation of NPCs more
significantly than did CAM/2010, as indicated
by the substantial decrease in phosphorylated
histone H3 (P-H3)–positive cells (Fig. 1D and
fig. S4A) and the cell cycle exit index (Ki67 –
BrdU+/BrdU+ cells) (fig. S4B). Thus, as compared
with the ancestral strain, the contemporary ZIKV
strain is more virulent to the mouse brain and
causes a more severe microcephaly phenotype
in the embryonic brain.
We then sought to identify the genetic deter-
minants for the observed virulence phenotype.
Genome sequence alignment, with the ancestral
strain CAM/2010 as a reference strain, revealed
that contemporary ZIKV strains harbor a num-
ber of substitutions of amino acids throughout
the genome (fig. S5). We mapped these amino
acid substitutions on a maximum likelihood tree
(fig. S6) and found a positive correlation between
the evolution of ZIKV of the Asian lineage and
sampling dates (Fig. 2A). Further coalescent anal-
ysis indicated that multiple critical residue sub-
stitutions have arisen at different time points
before the South American outbreak and have
been maintained stably in the contemporary epi-
demic strains (Fig. 2B and fig. S7). To identify
potential virulence determinants, seven mutant
viruses [Thr106→Ala106 (T106A), S109N, N130S,

 S139N, K709R, A982V, and N3144S (S, Ser; N,
Asn; K, Lys; R, Arg; V, Val)] were constructed on
the basis of the infectious clone of CAM/2010
[wild type (WT)] (fig. S8A), as described previous-
ly (17). All seven mutant viruses were successfully
recovered in BHK-21 cells, and their replication
and plaque phenotypes were found to be sim-
ilar to the WT virus in vitro (fig. S8, B and C). Of
all mutants, the S139N mutant virus exhibited
the greatest neurovirulence in neonatal mice
(Fig. 3A). More importantly, a single reverse sub-
stitution, N139S, of the parental virus VEN/2016
significantly decreased mortality caused by the
virus in neonatal mice (Fig. 3B and fig. S9). We
further characterized the infectivity of the S139N
and WT viruses in human NPCs (hNPCs) (fig. S10)
derived from human embryonic stem cells (5).
Our results confirmed that S139N showed en-
hanced replication in hNPCs (Fig. 3C) and caused
more extensive cell death compared with the WT
virus (Fig. 3D). Similarly, the S139N mutant showed
enhanced viral replication in mNPCs compared
with the WT virus (fig. S11A).
Finally, we tested the effect of the S139N sub-
stitution in the embryonic microcephaly model.
Infection of the S139N mutant virus led to a
more severe microcephalic phenotype (Fig. 4A)
and thinner cortex (Fig. 4B and fig. S11B) than
did infection of the WT virus. Specifically, the
S139N mutant virus showed a more robust in-
fection of the NPCs of the embryonic brains (fig.
S11, C and D), accompanied by more cell death
in the cortical plate (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, the
S139N mutant disturbed the NPC proliferation
and differentiation more significantly than did
the WT virus (Fig. 4D and fig. S12). As expected,
the N130S mutant virus caused much less cell
death than the S139N mutant in different regions
of the brain, similar to the WT virus (fig. S13).
Bioinformatic analysis had identified a panel
of substitutions that could have given rise to the
different biological phenotypes of ZIKV (11, 21, 22).
However, none of these predications have been
validated experimentally. Our results from reverse
genetics and mouse neurovirulence studies pro-
vide experimental evidence that a single S139N
substitution significantly enhances ZIKV infec-
tivity in both human and mouse NPCs and leads
to more severe microcephaly in fetal mice. Co-
alescent analysis indicated that the ZIKV S139N
substitution first emerged in May 2013 (95% high-
est probability density intervals: November 2012
to October 2013), a few months before the 2013
outbreak in French Polynesia (21, 23), and was
then stably maintained in the epidemic strain
during subsequent spread to the Americas (Fig. 2).
The emergence of the S139N substitution cor-
relates with reports of microcephaly and other
severe neurological abnormalities, including

 Guillain-Barré syndrome (24, 25). Our findings
offer an explanation for the unexpected causal
link of ZIKV to microcephaly and will help to
clarify how ZIKV evolved from an innocuous
mosquito-borne virus into a congenital patho-
gen with global impact.
Structural modeling based on dengue virus, a
closely related flavivirus member, indicates that
residue 139, referred to as residue 17 of prM pro-
tein, is fully exposed on the surface of prM-E
heterodimers or immature particles (fig. S14).
The prM protein of flavivirus is required for
viral maturation, egress, and secretion, and the
pr domain is thought to prevent premature fu-
sion within the infected cells (26). Flavivirus-
infected cells contain a mixture of immature,
partially mature, and mature particles (27). A re-
cent study showed that the first 40 amino acids
of the pr domain are involved in the interactions
withintrimericspikesintheimmaturevirusparticle
and affect the dynamics of conformational changes
(28). The S139N substitution might have some
effects on the transition of ZIKV from the imma-
ture to the mature virion, and the heterogeneity
in maturity of progeny virions might thus affect
viral fitness as well as neurovirulence. Our re-
sults also show that the ancestral Asian strain
CAM/2010 can result in a mild microcephaly phe-
notype in mouse fetus (Fig. 1), and the N139S
reverse mutant virus of contemporary ZIKV strain
retains some neurovirulence to neonatal mice
(Fig. 3B). Thus, further work will be required to
identify additional viral genetic determinants
