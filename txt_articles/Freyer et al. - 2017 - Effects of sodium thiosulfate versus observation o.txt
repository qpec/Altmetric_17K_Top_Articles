Summary
Background Sodium thiosulfate is an antioxidant shown in preclinical studies in animals to prevent cisplatin-induced 
hearing loss with timed administration after cisplatin without compromising the antitumour effi
  cacy of cisplatin. The 
primary aim of this study was to assess sodium thiosulfate for prevention of cisplatin-induced hearing loss in children 
and adolescents.
Methods ACCL0431 was a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial that enrolled participants at 
38 participating Children’s Oncology Group hospitals in the USA and Canada. Eligible participants aged 1–18 years 
with newly diagnosed cancer and normal audiometry were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive sodium thiosulfate or 
observation (control group) in addition to their planned cisplatin-containing chemotherapy regimen, using permuted 
blocks of four. Randomisation was initially stratifi
 ed by age and duration of cisplatin infusion. Stratifi
 cation by 
previous cranial irradiation was added later as a protocol amendment. The allocation sequence was computer-
generated centrally and concealed to all personnel. Participants received sodium thiosulfate 16 g/m² intravenously 6 h 
after each cisplatin dose or observation. The primary endpoint was incidence of hearing loss 4 weeks after fi
 nal 
cisplatin dose. Hearing was measured using standard audiometry and reviewed centrally by audiologists masked to 
allocation using American Speech-Language-Hearing Association criteria but treatment was not masked for 
participants or clinicians. Analysis of the primary endpoint was by modifi
 ed intention to treat, which included all 
randomly assigned patients irrespective of treatment received but restricted to those assessable for hearing loss. 
Enrolment is complete and this report represents the fi
 nal analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
number NCT00716976.
Findings Between June 23, 2008, and Sept 28, 2012, 125 eligible participants were randomly assigned to either sodium 
thiosulfate (n=61) or observation (n=64). Of these, 104 participants were assessable for the primary endpoint (sodium 
thiosulfate, n=49; control, n=55). Hearing loss was identifi
 ed in 14 (28·6%; 95% CI 16·6–43·3) participants in the 
sodium thiosulfate group compared with 31 (56·4%; 42·3–69·7) in the control group (p=0·00022). Adjusted for 
stratifi
 cation variables, the likelihood of hearing loss was signifi
 cantly lower in the sodium thiosulfate group compared 
with the control group (odds ratio 0·31, 95% CI 0·13–0·73; p=0·0036). The most common grade 3–4 haematological 
adverse events reported, irrespective of attribution, were neutropenia (117 [66%] of 177 participant cycles in the 
sodium thiosulfate group vs 145 [65%] of 223 in the control group), whereas the most common non-haematological 
adverse event was hypokalaemia (25 [17%] of 147 vs 22 [12%] of 187). Of 194 serious adverse events reported in 
26 participants who had received sodium thiosulfate, none were deemed probably or defi
 nitely related to sodium 
thiosulfate; the most common serious adverse event was decreased neutrophil count: 26 episodes in 14 participants.
Interpretation Sodium thiosulfate protects against cisplatin-induced hearing loss in children and is not associated 
with serious adverse events attributed to its use. Further research is needed to defi
 ne the appropriate role for sodium 
thiosulfate among emerging otoprotection strategies.

Introduction
Cisplatin is an eff
 ective chemotherapeutic drug for 
treatment of many human cancers.1 In paediatric 
oncology, cisplatin is a standard component of chemo-
therapy regimens for neuroblastoma, hepato 
blastoma, 
medullo 
blastoma, osteosarcoma, malignant germ cell 
tumour, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. More than 
2000 children aged 1–15 years receive cisplatin annually 
in the USA alone.2
Unfortunately, cisplatin causes clinically signifi
 cant 
cisplatin-induced hearing loss, which is characterised as 
progressive, irreversible, bilateral, and often accompanied 
by tinnitus.3 Cisplatin-induced hearing loss aff
 ects all 
hearing frequencies through the progressive death of

cochlear outer hair cells mediated by cisplatin-induced 
cytosolic reactive oxygen species in the mitochondria.4 
About 40% of children receiving cisplatin develop 
cisplatin-induced hearing loss, but the incidence 
approaches 100% in specifi
 c subsets.5–7 Risk factors for 
developing cisplatin-induced hearing loss include 
younger age (<5 years), higher cumulative cisplatin dose 
(>200–400 mg/m²), and cranial irradiation involving the 
cochlea.3,8 The functional eff
 ect of even mild cisplatin-
induced hearing loss for children and adolescents is 
substantial with many long-term implications, including 
impaired language acquisition, learning, academic 
performance, social–emotional development, and quality 
of life.7,9 For young adults, tinnitus with or without 
cisplatin-induced hearing loss is a common, continuous, 
and annoying form of long-term cisplatin ototoxicity.10
Consequently, researchers, clinicians, parents, and 
cancer survivors are interested in the identifi
 cation of 
otoprotectants that prevent cisplatin-induced hearing loss 
while preserving chemotherapeutic effi
  cacy. One potential 
otoprotectant is sodium thiosulfate. Sodium thiosulfate is 
a thiol-containing antioxidant that is rapidly excreted by 
the kidneys after intravenous administration.11 Sodium 
thiosulfate is approved by the US Food and Drug 
Administration for treatment of cyanide poisoning.11 
Biochemical eff
 ects of sodium thiosulfate relevant to its 
otoprotective potential include inactivation of oxygen free-
radicals and electrophilic platinum species.12–14 Animal 
studies14,15 have shown that sodium thiosulfate prevents 
cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. In both animal model and 
cell culture systems, concurrent administration of sodium 
thiosulfate abrogates cisplatin cytotoxicity, which raises 
potential concern for tumour protection. However, 
preclinical testing15,16 showed that when sodium thiosulfate 
administration is delayed until 4–8 h after cisplatin 
treatment, otoprotection can be retained without com-
promising cytotoxicity. Building on initial observations, 
clinical studies17,18 in adults with brain tumours receiving 
an ototoxic regimen of high-dose intra-arterial carboplatin 
with blood–brain barrier disruption reported that similarly 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Cisplatin is widely used for treatment of paediatric malignancies 
but often causes permanent sensorineural hearing loss and 
tinnitus resulting in functional disability and poor quality of life 
in survivors of childhood and adolescent cancer. Historically, 
cisplatin dose reduction, deletion, and delay have been the only 
options for ameliorating cisplatin-induced hearing loss. We 
searched the MEDLINE database for peer-reviewed reports of 
clinical trials published in any language between Jan 1, 2005, 
and Dec 31, 2015, using the search terms “ototoxicity”, “hearing 
loss”, “cisplatin”, “carboplatin”, “otoprotection”, “amifostine”, 
and “sodium thiosulfate”. When the ACCL0431 trial was 
conceived, two randomised studies of amifostine found no 
evidence of protection against cisplatin-induced hearing loss. 
Sodium thiosulfate had been shown in preclinical studies to 
prevent cisplatin-induced hearing loss and in adults to prevent 
hearing loss caused by high-dose intra-arterial carboplatin 
given for brain tumours. Among children, sodium thiosulfate 
was found to be well tolerated when given for the same 
purpose. These fi
 ndings formed the basis for developing 
ACCL0431, a randomised clinical trial done by the Children’s 
Oncology Group, with the primary aim of determining whether 
sodium thiosulfate, compared with observation, prevented 
cisplatin-induced hearing loss in children receiving cisplatin for 
treatment of newly-diagnosed cancer. While ACCL0431 was in 
progress, the Childhood Liver Tumours Strategy Group 
launched SIOPEL-6, a randomised controlled trial to study 
sodium thiosulfate for preventing cisplatin-induced hearing 
loss in children with standard-risk hepatoblastoma; 
additionally, one comparative cohort study of double-dose 
amifostine was published that showed evidence of protection 
against cisplatin-induced hearing loss in children treated for 
medulloblastoma.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, ACCL0431 is the fi
 rst cooperative oncology 
group-sponsored, multicentre randomised controlled trial 
focused solely on prevention of cisplatin-induced hearing loss in 
children and adolescents treated for cancer with various disease-
specifi
 c chemotherapy regimens. Our fi
 ndings establish that 
sodium thiosulfate signifi
 cantly reduces the incidence of 
cisplatin-induced hearing loss in children and adolescents. This 
benefi
 t seems to be greatest in children younger than 5 years, 
who are most susceptible to cisplatin-induced hearing loss. We 
found no apparent eff
 ect on event-free survival or overall 
survival related to sodium thiosulfate in participants with 
localised disease, but in participants with disseminated disease 
overall survival was signifi
 cantly lower.
Implications of all the available evidence
To our knowledge, sodium thiosulfate is the fi
 rst proven drug 
tested under the conditions of this trial to reduce risk for 
cisplatin-induced hearing loss, thus representing an important 
development in translational otoprotection research. At the same 
time, the signifi
 cantly lower overall survival seen in participants 
with disseminated disease who received sodium thiosulfate 
compared with those patients who did not necessitates caution 
when considering a future role for sodium thiosulfate. 
Recommendations for clinical practice and research will be further 
informed by the results of the ongoing SIOPEL-6 study involving 
only participants with standard-risk hepatoblastoma given a 
protocol-specifi
 ed regimen of single-drug cisplatin. Additional 
research and thoughtful consideration is needed to understand 
what role sodium thiosulfate and other potential drugs should 
have in preventing cisplatin-induced hearing loss in specifi
 c 
subsets of at-risk patients.

delayed administration of sodium thiosulfate protected 
hearing. This combined regimen was well tolerated when 
given to 12 children aged between 17 months and 12 years.19
On the basis of this collective experience and studies 
suggesting sodium thiosulfate might prevent cisplatin-
induced renal and haematological toxicity,20 we developed 
ACCL0431, a multicentre, phase 3, randomised clinical 
trial sponsored by the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) 
for children and adolescents with newly diagnosed 
cancer. The primary aim was to compare the proportional 
incidence of post-treatment cisplatin-induced hearing 
loss between participants randomly assigned to receive 
or not receive sodium thiosulfate.
Methods
Study design and participants
ACCL0431 was a multicentre, randomised, open-label, 
phase 3 trial. We enrolled participants at 38 participating 
COG hospitals in the USA and Canada (appendix p 3). 
We obtained written informed consent or assent from 
participants or their legal guardians before registration. 
The study was approved by the US National Cancer 
Institute (NCI) Central Institutional Review Board and 
site institutional review boards. The protocol is available 
in the appendix. Co-enrolment onto a companion 
observational cohort study of ototoxicity grading scales 
was mandatory (ACCL05C1; NCT00458887).
Participants were aged 1–18 years at study entry and 
were newly diagnosed with hepatoblastoma, germ cell 
tumour, medulloblastoma or CNS primitive neuro-
ectodermal tumour, neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, or 
other cancer types treated with cisplatin. Key eligibility 
criteria included planned cumulative cisplatin dose of 
200 mg/m² or more and infusion duration of 6 h or less; 
performance score of 50 or more by the Karnofsky 
(>16 years) or Lansky (≤16 years) scales; no previous 
cisplatin or carboplatin treatment; no known thiol 
hypersensitivity; and normal institutional laboratory 
values refl
 ecting haematological, renal, and hepatic 
function. Normal hearing was required before enrolment 
as defi
 ned by hearing thresholds of 20 dB hearing level 
(HL) or less at 500–8000 Hz when measured with 
earphones or 25 dB HL or less when measured in the 
sound fi
 eld, or as defi
 ned by brainstem auditory evoked 
response thresholds equivalent to behavioural thresholds 
of 20 dB HL or less. Previous cranial irradiation was 
initially not allowed but later permitted, provided 
hearing was normal, by a protocol amendment 
(March 31, 2010) to augment trial recruitment. Patients 
were not eligible if they were registered on a cancer-
directed COG therapeutic study to avoid potential 
confounding of the primary aims by the ACCL0431 
randomisation.
Randomisation and masking
We enrolled and randomly assigned participants to either 
sodium thiosulfate or observation (control group) up to 
5 days before they received any cisplatin. We generated the 
allocation sequence for each stratum according to a 
permuted block algorithm, where each block of four 
contained two sodium thiosulfate and two control 
randomisations. 
The 
randomisation 
was 
centrally 
computer-generated by the COG trial management 
system. Allocation was electronically concealed to all 
investigators, clinicians, and participants. Site research 
staff
  did the enrolment, entering eligibility confi
 rmation 
and specifi
 cation of stratifi
 cation factors into the COG 
trial management system, and receiving the electronically 
generated allocation for the site. Randomisation was 1:1 
and was initially stratifi
 ed into four groups defi
 ned by 
age (<5 years or ≥5 years) and duration of cisplatin 
infusion (<2 h or ≥2 h). Later, we added one separate 
stratum for eligible participants who had previously 
received cranial irradiation, irrespective of age or duration 
of cisplatin infusion. Randomisation was masked for 
central reviewers of audiometry data, but was not placebo-
controlled for participants or treating clinicians to 
minimise complexity and cost for participating sites.
Procedures
Cisplatin was to be administered as specifi
 ed by each 
participant’s cancer treatment plan. For participants 
randomly assigned to the control group, the cisplatin-
containing treatment regimen alone was to be 
administered. Participants in the sodium thiosulfate 
group received sodium thiosulfate daily over 15 min 
beginning 6 h after the completion of each cisplatin 
dose. This sodium thiosulfate schedule was selected on 
the basis of preclinical studies that showed combined 
otoprotection and non-interference with cisplatin 
chemotherapeutic eff
 ect when sodium thiosulfate was 
delayed until 4–8 h post-cisplatin.15,16 The protocol-
specifi
 ed sodium thiosulfate dose was 16 g/m² 
(533 mg/kg where the cisplatin dose was calculated by 
bodyweight) administered as a 12·5% solution. This 
sodium thiosulfate dose was selected because it was 
within the published eff
 ective dose range and was well 
tolerated by children.14–19 For participants receiving 
multiday cisplatin regimens, a documented serum 
sodium concentration of less than 145 mEq/L was 
required before each sodium thiosulfate dose, and a 
minimum of 10 h was to have elapsed between sodium 
thiosulfate and the next cisplatin dose. Otherwise, no 
modifi
 cations of dose or administration of sodium 
thiosulfate or other chemotherapy drugs were to be 
made. Protocol guidelines for supportive care during the 
sodium 
thiosulfate 
infusion 
included 
routine 
administration of antiemetics, limited blood pressure 
monitoring, and, if applicable, administration of low-
dose meperidine to manage infusion-related rigors. 
Concurrent use of other ototoxic drugs (eg, amino-
glycosides and loop diuretics) was discouraged by 
protocol for all participants but captured in data 
reporting. Cisplatin dose modifi
 cations were not

captured as participants did not receive cancer treatment 
according to specifi
 ed protocols.
Hearing assessments were to be done at baseline, up 
to 8 days before each cisplatin course, 4 weeks after 
completion of the fi
 nal cisplatin course, and 1 year later. 
Audiometry was to include measurement of bilateral 
pure tone air conduction thresholds at 500–8000 Hz 
with earphones or in the sound fi
 eld using paediatric 
hearing assessment methods; otoscopy; immittance 
evaluation of middle ear function; and evoked 
otoacoustic emissions, if available. For participants 
unable to cooperate due to very young age, developmental 
disability, or medical status, brainstem auditory evoked 
response thresholds were to be measured instead. 
Audiometry conformed to detailed testing procedures 
described in the protocol of the companion observational 
cohort study (ACCL05C1). In addition to institutional 
electronic entry of all required audiometry data, a copy 
of each audiogram was faxed to the COG Operations 
Center for independent review by two expert paediatric 
audiologists for whom randomisation was masked (KK, 
BB); diff
 erences in interpretation were resolved by 
consensus. Hearing loss was determined according to 
American 
Speech-Language-Hearing 
Association 
(ASHA) criteria.21 In brief, ASHA is a binary criterion 
(yes or no) designed for early detection of ototoxicity. 
Ototoxicity is defi
 ned as a 20 dB or more worsening in 
pure tone threshold at one test frequency or a 10 dB or 
more worsening at two adjacent test frequencies by 
comparison with a normal baseline. ASHA criteria 
exceed test–retest variability, indicate hearing loss due to 
ototoxicity, and at the time ACCL0431 was designed, 
were regarded as the most sensitive criteria.
We assessed each participant-cycle for the presence of 
haematological and renal toxicity; haematological 
(complete blood count) and renal (serum creatinine, 
blood urea nitrogen, electrolytes, magnesium, and 
phosphorous concentrations) function were to be 
assessed 7–10 days after each cisplatin course for all 
participants. Using the Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE; version 4.0), we defi
 ned 
haematological toxicity as the occurrence of grade 3 or 
higher anaemia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia. We 
defi
 ned nephro 
toxicity as the occurrence of grade 3 or 
higher hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypophos-
phataemia, acidosis, increased serum creatinine, or 
decreased glomerular fi
 ltration rate.
At a minimum, all participants were required to undergo 
disease assessments at baseline, after completion of the 
cancer treatment regimen, and then every 6 months for 
3 years, as well as in the case of clinical suspicion for 
disease progression or recurrence. We assigned disease 
status on the basis of institutional report. Because of the 
heterogeneity of cancers, we did not accession disease-
specifi
 c tumour stage and risk category at study entry. 
Later, to supplement the initial survival analysis, each 
participant’s extent-of-disease at study entry was recorded 
post hoc with a protocol-specifi
 c binary classifi
 cation of 
localised versus disseminated.
We obtained a saliva or blood specimen from each 
participant who chose to take part in an exploratory 
optional aspect of the trial after a protocol amendment 
(March 31, 2010; samples taken retrospectively for those 
enrolled before the amendment) to assess mutations in 
the TPMT and COMT genes. Because of an insuffi
  cient 
number of samples, analysis and publication are not 
currently planned.
Criteria for ending protocol treatment included 
completion of the cancer treatment regimen, premature 
discontinuation of cisplatin, administration of cranial 
irradiation after enrolment but before measurement of 
the primary endpoint, and inability to continue sodium 
thiosulfate. Participants off
  protocol treatment were 
followed up for all endpoints. Criteria for removal from 
the study included death, loss to follow-up, or entry onto 
another COG therapeutic study for the underlying cancer 
(in which case we obtained survival data from that 
therapeutic study).
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was hearing loss at 4 weeks after 
fi
 nal cisplatin treatment, but before any haemopoietic 
cell transplantation, according to the validated ototoxicity 
criteria. Participants were deemed not assessable for 
this outcome if we found during central review that 
audiometry data derived from headphone, sound fi
 eld, or 
brainstem auditory evoked response testing at baseline 
or 
post-treatment 
were 
missing, 
incomplete, 
or 
technically unsatisfactory.
Secondary endpoints were frequency-specifi
 c hearing 
loss at 4 weeks (for 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, 4000 Hz, 
and 8000 Hz), haematological and renal toxicity, event-
free survival (defi
 ned as the time from study enrolment 
until disease relapse or progression, diagnosis of a 
second malignant neoplasm, or death, whichever came 
fi
 rst), and overall survival (defi
 ned as the time from 
enrolment to death or last date confi
 rmed alive).
By protocol amendment on March 31, 2010, we added 
an exploratory secondary aim to assess the association of 
mutations in the TPMT and COMT genes with cisplatin-
induced hearing loss and sodium thiosulfate eff
 ect.
Statistical analysis
The primary endpoint of hearing loss according to ASHA 
criteria compared the audiometric evaluation at 
enrolment (ie, baseline) with the fi
 rst assessment done at 
least 4 weeks after the fi
 nal dose of cisplatin (ie, post-
treatment). Using a modifi
 ed intention-to-treat approach, 
we analysed patients on the basis of their randomisation 
assignment, irrespective of treatment received, but 
included only eligible participants who completed both 
baseline and post-treatment hearing assessments.
The accrual goal was 108 participants with complete 
hearing evaluation allocated equally to the two study

5
groups. We compared the proportion that developed 
hearing loss by treatment group using a one-sided χ² test.22 
We deemed a p value of 0·05 or less to be signifi
 cant. 
Assuming a 4-week cumulative hearing loss incidence of 
45% in the control group and an incidence of 22·5% in 
the sodium thiosulfate group, the study as designed would 
provide 80% power. The probability of hearing loss among 
patients in the control group was based on a contemporary 
paediatric report involving multiple tumour types.7 
Reduction of this probability by half was deemed clinically 
relevant. Because participants who had received previous 
cranial irradiation were added through an amendment, 
we did a post-hoc sensitivity analysis that included only 
participants who were not enrolled in the new stratum. 
We also did a post-hoc analysis of hearing loss at the 1-year 
timepoint for participants who had interpretable 
audiometry data and had not had a survival event or 
haemopoietic cell transplantation; these participants were 
excluded due to the inability to control for additional 
ototoxic exposures.
We estimated the magnitude of the association between 
sodium thiosulfate assignment and hearing loss using the 
odds ratio (OR); p values for the test of OR=1 and 
corresponding 95% CI were derived using the Wald test 
for the parameter associated with the randomised 
treatment assignment from a logistic model.22 The logistic 
model was stratifi
 ed according to the strata used for 
randomisation. We estimated stratum-specifi
 c probabilities 
of hearing loss using the observed proportion of assessable 
participants in the particular stratum with hearing loss; we 
also calculated exact 95% CIs.23
We planned interim monitoring for futility of an 
otoprotective eff
 ect of sodium thiosulfate. After we 
ascertained the primary outcome measure in the fi
 rst 
60 patients, we calculated the probability of rejecting the 
null hypothesis at the end of planned enrolment on the 
basis of observed hearing loss to that point and the 
assumption that development of hearing loss for future 
participants would follow the alternative hypothesis. If 
this conditional probability was 0·10 or less, the study 
was to be identifi
 ed to the COG Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee for closure due to lack of effi
  cacy.
The change in hearing threshold between baseline and 
post-treatment 
timepoint 
at 
diff
 erent 
frequencies 
(500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, 4000 Hz, and 8000 Hz) was 
determined by the mean change, and assessed the 
hypothesis of no diff
 erence between groups using the 
Wilcoxon two-sample test for non-parametric data. 
Testing of the normality assumption is shown in the 
appendix (p 2). We deemed a one-sided p value 0·05 or 
less to be signifi
 cant; we made no adjustment for 
multiple comparisons for this assessment.
For haematological and renal toxicity, denominators 
represent the number of participants who completed the 
required toxicity assessment during each cycle. For both 
types of toxicity, we assessed the hypothesis of no 
diff
 erence in incidence using a χ² test of proportions.
For event-free survival and overall survival, patients 
who did not have an event were censored at time of last 
contact. We estimated the probability of remaining event 
free as a function of time post-enrolment using the 
method of Kaplan and Meier.24 We compared risk of event 
across groups defi
 ned by randomised regimen using the 
log-rank statistic. We generated relative hazard ratios 
(RHR) and 95% CIs by fi
 tting a relative-risk regression 
model, using partial likelihood where the model 
contained the characteristic of interest as the only 
variable. We computed survival estimates as 3-year 
event-free survival and 3-year overall survival. We did a 
post-hoc analysis of event-free survival and overall 
survival by extent of disease using the same methods. We 
considered all eligible participants in the survival analyses 
by intention to treat. We did all statistical calculations

Role of the funding source
The NCI Cancer Evaluation Treatment Program and 
Division of Cancer Prevention had a role in study design 
through the required review process and approved the 
fi
 nal protocol, but had no role in the data collection, data 
analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. 
Fennec Pharmaceuticals, which provided sodium 
thiosulfate at no cost, was permitted to review the fi
 nal 
manuscript only for errors of fact or proprietary 
information. All authors had access to the raw data. The 
corresponding author had full access to all the data in the 
study and had fi
 nal responsibility for the decision to 
submit for publication.
Results
Between June 23, 2008, and Sept 28, 2012, we enrolled 
131 participants from 38 institutions, reaching the planned 
accrual goal (fi
 gure 1). Six participants were deemed 
ineligible; four because they were co-enrolled on a disease-
directed COG therapeutic study (with three participants 
randomly assigned to sodium thiosulfate and one to 
control), one because cranial irradiation was administered 
before reaching the primary endpoint (randomly assigned 
to control), and one because there was no source 
documentation of normal baseline serum electrolyte 
values (randomly assigned to sodium thiosulfate). Of the 
125 eligible participants, 38 were enrolled before and 87 
after the protocol amendment that allowed participants 
who had previously received cranial irradiation to enrol 
(n=9). 64 participants were randomly assigned to the 
control group and 61 to the sodium thiosulfate group. 
Interim monitoring resulted in recommendations to 
continue the trial as planned. Data current to 
March 31, 2015, were used in this analysis.
Baseline characteristics were similar between groups 
(table 1). The overall proportions of eligible participants 
with disseminated disease at study entry were similar;

four eligible participants in each group had previously 
received 
cranial 
irradiation. 
The 
disease-specifi
 c 
characteristics of participants by randomisation group 
with respect to age and extent of disease were balanced 
between groups (appendix p 1). The median cumulative 
cisplatin dose for the control group was 387 mg/m² 
(IQR 305–466) and for the sodium thiosulfate group was 
393 mg/m² (290–420). The median cumulative sodium 
thiosulfate dose was 95·8 g/m² (60·1–127·6). The 
proportions of participants who had received loop 
diuretics or aminoglycoside antibiotics were similar in 
the control (17 [27%] of 64 participants) and sodium 
thiosulfate (17 [28%] of 61 participants) groups. No 
participants underwent haemopoietic cell transplantation 
before assessment for the primary endpoint. Because of 
an insuffi
  cient number of samples (n=50), analysis of 
mutations in the TPMT and COMT genes are not 
currently planned.
104 participants were assessable for post-treatment 
hearing loss at 4 weeks (55 of 64 participants in the control 
group and 49 of 61 in the sodium thiosulfate group). Of 
these assessable participants, 14 (29%) in the sodium 
thiosulfate group and 15 (27%) in the control group were 
younger than 5 years. Hearing loss was identifi
 ed in 
14 (28·6%; 95% CI 16·6–43·3) participants in the sodium 
thiosulfate group compared with 31 (56·4%; 42·3–69·7) in 
the control group (p=0·00022). For participants younger 
than 5 years, the incidence of hearing loss was substantially 
lower in the sodium thiosulfate group than in the

control group (three [21·4%] of 14 participants [95% CI 
4·7–50·8] vs 11 [73·3%] of 15 [44·9–92·2]); whereas 
the diff
 erence in incidence between groups was not as 
large for older patients (11 [31·4%; 16·9–49·3] of 35 vs 
20 [50·0%; 33·8–66·2] of 40). The incidence of hearing 
loss was lower for participants in the sodium thiosulfate 
group than in the control group after cisplatin infusion of 
2–6 h (ten [41·7%; 95% CI 22·1–63·4] of 24 vs 21 [70·0%; 
50·6–85·2] of 30) and after cisplatin infusion of less than 
2 h (four [16·0%; 4·5–36·1] of 25 vs ten [40·0%; 21·1–61·3] 
of 25). The stratum of previous cranial irradiation 
contained only eight assessable participants; hearing 
loss occurred in two (50%) of four sodium thiosulfate-
treated participants versus four (100%) of four patients 
in the control group. When these eight irradiated 
participants were excluded in a post-hoc analysis, hearing 
loss was noted in 12 (26·7%; 95% CI 14·6–41·9) of 
45 participants in the sodium thiosulfate group compared 
with 27 (52·9%; 38·5–67·1) of 51 in the control group 
(p=0·0045). By the logistic test adjusted for stratifi
 cation 
variables, the likelihood of hearing loss was signifi
 cantly 
lower in the sodium thiosulfate group compared with the 
control group (OR 0·31, 95% CI 0·13–0·73; p=0·0036). 
When the eight irradiated participants were removed 
from the analysis, the unadjusted OR was 0·32 (95% CI 
0·13–0·76; p=0·010). Of the 104 participants assessable 
for hearing loss at the primary endpoint, 67 were also 
assessable at 1 year in a post-hoc analysis; of these, nine 
(28%) of 32 participants who received sodium thiosulfate 
had ASHA-defi
 ned hearing loss compared with 19 (54%) 
of 35 controls (p=0·0015). For the eight assessable 
participants who had previously received cranial 
irradiation, none of their hearing outcomes at 1 year were 
changed from the 4-week timepoint.
The mean change in hearing threshold within key 
frequencies is shown in table 2. For the sodium thiosulfate 
group, the change in hearing threshold from baseline to 
4 weeks after cisplatin treatment was smaller than in the 
control group, although there was no signifi
 cant 
diff
 erence between the groups (table 2).
Haematological toxicity was not signifi
 cantly diff
 erent 
between the treatment groups, occurring in 137 (77%) of 
177 participant cycles in the sodium thiosulfate group and 
172 (77%) of 223 participant cycles in the control group 
(p=0·95; table 3). Aggregate nephrotoxicity was more 
common in the sodium thiosulfate group, in which 37 
(25%) of 147 participant cycles were aff
 ected versus 
25 
(13%) 
of 
187 
controls 
(p=0·0059; 
table 
4). 
Hypophosphataemia and hypokalaemia were more 
common in the sodium thiosulfate group than in the 
control group (table 4). Notably, no cases of either 
increased creatinine or reduced glomerular fi
 ltration rate 
met the CTCAE grade 3 threshold in either group (table 4).
The most common grade 3–4 haematological adverse 
events, irrespective of attribution, were neutropenia 
(117 [66%] of 177 participant cycles in the sodium 
thiosulfate group vs 145 [65%] of 223 in the control group), 
whereas the most common non-haematological adverse 
event was hypokalaemia (25 [17%] of 147 vs 22 [12%] of 
187). As part of the NCI Adverse Event Reporting System, 
this study included expedited reporting of serious adverse 
events. Reporting was required only for participants 
randomly assigned to the sodium thiosulfate group. 194 
serious adverse events were reported in 26 patients; of 
these, 112 were deemed unrelated, 62 unlikely, 20 possibly, 
and none probably or defi
 nitely related to sodium 
thiosulfate. 85 were non-haematological adverse events, 
of which 49 were deemed unrelated, 25 unlikely, 
11 possibly, and none probably or defi
 nitely related to 
sodium thiosulfate; 70 were haematological adverse 
events, of which 53 were deemed unrelated, 13 were 
deemed unlikely, four possibly, and none probably or 
defi
 nitely related to sodium thiosulfate. Of the 194 serious 
adverse events, the three most common were decreased 
neutrophil count (26 [13%] in 14 participants), decreased 
platelet count (23 [12%] in 12 participants), and anaemia 
(21 [11%] in ten participants). See appendix (p 4) for a 
summary of serious adverse events.
All 125 eligible patients were included in the analysis 
of event-free survival and overall survival. Median follow-
up was 3·5 years (IQR 1·4–4·5) for event-free survival 
(median follow-up 3·4 years [IQR 2·9–4·3] for the 
sodium thiosulfate group, and 3·8 years [3·1–4·5] for 
the control group) and 3·5 years (1·5–4·5) for overall 
survival (median follow-up 3·4 years [2·9–4·3] for the 
sodium thiosulfate group, and 3·8 years [3·1–4·7] for 
the control group). Among the 61 participants assigned 
to sodium thiosulfate, 26 events and 17 deaths occurred; 
among the 64 participants in the control group, 24 events 
and ten deaths occurred. All events were relapse except 
for one participant in the sodium thiosulfate group who 
developed a second malignant neoplasm. As classifi
 ed 
by site investigators, all deaths were deemed to be due to 
disease, except for one death in the sodium thiosulfate 
group that was attributed to cancer treatment-related 
sepsis but was not related to sodium thiosulfate. 
Considering the entire sample, no signifi
 cant diff
 erence 
was noted between the sodium thiosulfate and control

groups for event-free survival or overall survival 
(fi
 gure 2). 3-year event-free survival was 54% (95% CI 
40–66) in the sodium thiosulfate group versus 
64% (50–74) in the control group; 3-year overall survival 
was 70% (56–80) versus 87% (76–93).
Because of the possibility of an eff
 ect of sodium 
thiosulfate on survival that emerged for the sample as a 
whole, we did a post-hoc stratifi
 cation of the sample by 
extent of disease at enrolment. Within the group deemed 
to have localised disease (n=77), we found no signifi
 cant 
diff
 erence between treatment groups in event-free 
survival (median follow-up 3·4 years [IQR 3·2–4·3] for 
the sodium thiosulfate group, and 3·7 years [3·1–4·5] for 
the control group) or overall survival (median follow-up 
3·5 years [3·2–4·3] for the sodium thiosulfate group, and 
3·8 years [3·0–4·8] for the control group; fi
 gure 3). The 
3-year event-free survival was 60% (95% CI 42–74) for the 
sodium thiosulfate group versus 66% (48–78) for the 
control group; 3-year overall survival was 83% (66–92) 
versus 89% (74–96). Among participants with localised 
disease, 14 events and six deaths in both the control and 
sodium thiosulfate groups occurred. Among participants 
deemed to have disseminated disease (n=47), we found 
no diff
 erence between treatment groups in event-free 
survival (median follow-up 3·2 years [IQR 3·0–4·3] for 
the sodium thiosulfate group, and 4·1 years [3·1–4·5] for

the control group), but overall survival was signifi
 cantly 
lower in the sodium thiosulfate group compared with the 
control group (median follow-up 3·2 years [3·0–4·5] for 
the sodium thiosulfate group, and 3·8 years [3·1–4·5] for 
the control group; fi
 gure 3). 3-year event-free survival 
was 42% (95% CI 21–61) in the sodium thiosulfate group 
versus 61% (39–77) in the control group; 3-year overall 
survival was 45% (23–65) versus 84% (62–94). In 
participants with disseminated disease, 12 events and 
11 deaths occurred in the sodium thiosulfate group and 
ten events and four deaths occurred in the control group.
Discussion
We report the results of a multicentre randomised 
controlled trial showing that sodium thiosulfate 
signifi
 cantly reduces risk for developing cisplatin-
induced hearing loss in children and adolescents treated 
for cancer. Consistent with our hypothesis, delayed post-
cisplatin administration of sodium thiosulfate in a study 
population comprising a mixture of ages, diagnoses, and 
chemotherapy 
regimens 
reduced 
the 
cumulative 
incidence of ASHA-defi
 ned cisplatin-induced hearing 
loss by about 50%. To the best of our knowledge, with 
these results, sodium thiosulfate becomes the fi
 rst 
proven drug tested under these conditions and thus 
represents an important development in translational 
otoprotection research. Notably, to our knowledge, 
ACCL0431 is the fi
 rst NCI-funded cooperative group 
clinical trial focused solely on prevention of cisplatin-
induced hearing loss in either children or adults. As 
such, the ACCL0431 experience shows both the feasibility 
and scientifi
 c value of doing otoprotection studies in the 
cooperative group setting. This study addresses a 
clinically important goal because of the profound, 
negative eff
 ect of ototoxicity on quality of life for survivors 
of cancer treated during young childhood and 
adolescence. It is reasonable to assume the benefi
 ts of 
preventing cisplatin-induced hearing loss and chronic 
tinnitus include reduction of their many downstream 
eff
 ects on language acquisition, learning, psychosocial 
development, and social functioning.9,10
The absence of eff
 ective otoprotectants in human beings 
limits comparison of our results with the results of other 
drugs.25 So far, amifostine has been studied more than any 
other medication for this purpose but showed no evidence 
of otoprotection against cisplatin-induced hearing loss in 
two embedded COG randomised controlled trials for 
hepatoblastoma and germ cell tumours.26,27 In a more

recent non-randomised, comparative prospective cohort 
study28 of children and adolescents treated with cisplatin 
for medullobastoma, Fouladi and colleagues reported 
otoprotection with a more dose-intensive amifostine 
regimen. Compared with amifostine, for which hypo-
calcaemia and hypotension are common adverse events 
that require monitoring and management protocols, 
sodium 
thiosulfate 
was 
substantially 
simpler 
to 
administer.29 We were unable to detect any protective 
eff
 ect of sodium thiosulfate on renal or haemopoietic 
function. Nephrotoxicity, as defi
 ned in our study, was 
more common in the sodium thiosulfate group but, 
importantly, not because of an abnormal serum creatinine 
or glomerular fi
 ltration rate but rather because of 
hypophosphataemia and hypokalaemia—explanations for 
which are unknown. We did not collect data regarding 
clinical consequences and treatment of haematological or 
renal toxicity. We were unable to assess whether sodium 
thiosulfate could have helped preserve cisplatin dose 
intensity through avoidance of dose modifi
 cations because 
cancer treatment was not protocol specifi
 ed.
Survival was a secondary endpoint of this study. We 
detected no signifi
 cant diff
 erence in event-free survival 
or overall survival by treatment group among our 
participants as a whole. In the stratifi
 ed post-hoc analysis 
by extent of disease at presentation, we saw no diff
 erence 
between treatment groups in event-free survival or 
overall survival for participants with localised disease. 
However, for participants with disseminated disease, we 
noted lower event-free survival and overall survival for 
patients treated with sodium thiosulfate than for patients 
in the control group. There are two broad potential 
explanations for this fi
 nding. First, sodium thiosulfate 
might be tumour protective in addition to being 
otoprotective, and this eff
 ect might be most pronounced 
in individuals with poorer prognosis, in whom the 
incremental eff
 ect of cisplatin is important for disease 
control. Additionally, we cannot exclude a tumour 
protective eff
 ect against other drugs used in combination 
with cisplatin. The second potential explanation could 
relate to disease characteristics that might aff
 ect outcome 
but that we were unable to measure directly because of 
the design of our study. For example, a wide range of 
tumours and tumour stages with varying prognoses 
were included in our trial. Although the diagnosis-
specifi
 c distribution of participants by age and extent of 
disease seems well balanced between the randomisation 
groups, we did not capture disease biology, an important 
outcome determinant routinely incorporated in the risk 
classifi
 cation of some paediatric cancers. This aspect of 
the trial design, combined with minor imbalances of 
uncommon poor-prognosis malignancies, could be 
relevant (appendix p 1). Among participants with 
disseminated disease, the magnitude of diff
 erence 
between treatment groups was greater for overall 
survival than for event-free survival, a fi
 nding also not 
readily accounted for. Perhaps relapsed patients 
previously exposed to sodium thiosulfate responded less 
well to retrieval treatment than patients in the control 
group, but this possibility cannot be assessed because 
data collection regarding relapse treatment and 
responses were beyond the scope of this trial. Although 
relapses accounted for all but one event, our data did not 
suggest relapses occurred disproportionately in any 
particular diagnostic subset.
ACCL0431 was designed as a proof-of-concept study 
focused on the otoprotective eff
 ects of sodium thiosulfate. 
Participants ranged in age from infancy through 
adolescence and were diagnosed with one of several 
cancers treated with cisplatin. This design aff
 orded several 
strengths for our study but introduced some potential 
weaknesses. The fact that ACCL0431 was a randomised, 
multicentre trial done in a cooperative group setting 
comprising 
both 
academic 
and 
community-based 
institutions of various sizes are notable strengths. The 
inclusion of diverse cancer diagnoses and risk groups 
off
 ered an effi
  cient accrual strategy and allowed sodium 
thiosulfate to be tested across a range of ages and 
treatment regimens. Another strength was the use of 
masked audiometry data by central reviewers who 
adjudicated the primary ototoxicity endpoint, thus 
reducing bias. However, the heterogeneity in participant 
and disease characteristics might have complicated our 
ability to understand potential diff
 erential eff
 ects of 
sodium thiosulfate on survival in view of other 
determinants such as stage and tumour biology. With 
hearing being the primary outcome, this study enrolled a 
diversity of cisplatin-treated cancers, with reliance on 
randomisation to balance such unmeasured factors. We 
calculated sample size for the primary outcome and 
monitored survival to detect large diff
 erences between 
groups. In our eff
 ort to elucidate an apparent survival 
diff
 erence that emerged in the sample as a whole, 
retrospective application of a simple binary classifi
 cation 
for extent of disease to our diverse sample might have 
helped isolate an anatomic subset in which sodium 
thiosulfate might aff
 ect outcome, but this approach is 
unlikely to take account of all the factors that inform 
disease-specifi
 c risk classifi
 cation. Although 21 (17%) of 
the 125 randomly assigned participants were not 
assessable for the hearing outcome, they were distributed 
fairly equally by randomisation and were similar to other 
participants except for predominantly being younger than 
5 years. This high proportion of unassessable patients 
represents the unique challenges inherent to otoprotection 
studies involving young children, in whom developmental 
stage and medical disability can limit cooperation for 
audiometry. Despite these challenges, participants 
younger than 5 years constituted the largest age group on 
this trial, accounting for a third of all participants (44 of 
125 participants). We recorded administration of 
potentially ototoxic loop diuretics and aminoglycoside 
antibiotics for all participants in this trial. Although we did 
not capture quantitative pharmacological data for loop

diuretics and aminoglycosides, or whether carboplatin 
was given, it is reasonable to assume these factors were 
similarly balanced through randomisation. Furthermore, 
all patients completed post-treatment audiometry before 
any haemopoietic cell transplantation, for which 
myeloablative carboplatin is typically used. In ACCL0431, 
hearing loss was graded according to the ASHA scale, 
which was selected because it was regarded as the most 
sensitive scale available at the time. Since then, the 
International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP)-
Boston scale has been developed and is thought to off
 er 
some advantages, including no requirement for a 
pretreatment 
baseline 
measurement.4 
Retrospective 
conversion of our results to the SIOP-Boston scale 
presented substantial methodological challenges and was 
not feasible for this report.
Despite these issues, the challenges associated with 
ACCL0431 have yielded valuable lessons for the design of 
future otoprotection trials involving systemic drugs. For 
example, we believe otoprotection studies should be 
linked, whenever possible, to disease-focused trials or 
protocol-specifi
 ed 
regimens 
to 
ensure 
consistent 
diagnoses, staging and risk classifi
 cation, treatment, data 
capture for cisplatin dose modifi
 cations, and collection of 
survival data. At the same time, it must be acknowledged 
that the design of ACCL0431, in the context of a large 
paediatric clinical trials group, needed to be responsive to 
understandable concerns about unforeseen interactions 
between sodium thiosulfate and chemotherapy that could 
obfuscate or change survival outcomes on key front-line 
trials. Since some ACCL0431 participants might have 
been included because they were not eligible for a 
therapeutic trial, the overall prognosis of the ACCL0431 
cohort might have been diff
 erent from that of all cisplatin-
treated paediatric patients with cancer. However, this 
possibility does not detract from the internal validity of 
our study or our conclusions related to sodium thiosulfate-
related otoprotection and potential survival eff
 ect. 
Additionally, the study of drugs requiring time-modulated 
administration post-cisplatin to avoid tumour protection 
presents challenges because interference might be a 
continuous rather than a dichotomous eff
 ect. Finally, 
otoprotectants that are mechanistically distinct from the 
cytotoxic eff
 ects of chemotherapy or that are administered 
by non-systemic routes (eg, intratympanic injection) 
might off
 er advantages.
In the interim, with this present report identifying 
sodium thiosulfate as a commercially available drug that 
reduces cisplatin-induced hearing loss, at least one 
immediate question is raised. About two-thirds of children 
enrolled on ACCL0431 were classifi
 ed as having localised 
disease; no diff
 erence between treatment groups in either 
event-free survival or overall survival were noted in this 
patient group. Can sodium thiosulfate be used safely in 
this subset of children? In this regard, encouraging 
preliminary results have been reported from SIOPEL-6 
(NCT00652132), an international randomised clinical trial 
for children with standard-risk hepatoblastoma treated 
with single-drug cisplatin with or without sodium 
thiosulfate 20 g/m² administered on the same schedule as 
ACCL0431. This important trial uses an alternative design 
involving only one cancer diagnosis treated with a protocol-
specifi
 ed regimen of single-drug cisplatin. Although 
hearing outcomes on that study are not expected until late 
2017, a 2016 survival analysis30 involving 109 patients 
revealed no diff
 erence between sodium thiosulfate and 
observation in 2-year event-free survival (89·0% vs 86·3%) 
and 2-year overall survival (97·7% vs 91·4%).
Only after fi
 nal results are available from SIOPEL-6 to 
inform the interpretation of ACCL0431 will it become 
possible to develop fi
 rm recommendations concerning a 
potential future role for sodium thiosulfate in clinical 
practice or future randomised trials. The two trials seem 
likely to prove complementary and provide a more 
complete understanding of the eff
 ects of sodium 
thiosulfate than either study alone. Thoughtful discussion 
within the community of stakeholders involving paediatric 
oncologists, otolaryngologists, audiologists, parents, and 
survivors living with cisplatin-induced hearing loss will be 
needed. Whether consensus can soon be reached on the 
question of using sodium thiosulfate for carefully defi
 ned 
patient subsets, it seems clear that the completion of 
ACCL0431 signals a new era in which the historical 
acceptance of cisplatin-induced hearing loss as an 
inevitable consequence of curative cancer treatment has 
given way to more encouraging possibilities.
