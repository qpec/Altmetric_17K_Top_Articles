Circulating biomarkers and incident
ischemic stroke in the Framingham
Offspring Study
ABSTRACT
Objective: We related a panel of inflammatory biomarkers to risk of incident ischemic stroke (IIS) in
a community-dwelling sample.
Methods: Stroke-free Framingham offspring attending examination cycle 7 (1998–2001) had 15
circulating inflammatory biomarkers measured. Cox proportional hazard models were used to
calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) of IIS per SD increment of each biomarker. Model 1 included
age and sex. Model 2 additionally adjusted for systolic blood pressure, hypertension treatment,
current smoking, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and atrial fibrillation. The continuous net re-
classification improvement was used to assess the improvement in IIS risk prediction of statis-
tically significant biomarkers from our main analysis over traditional stroke risk factors.
Results: In 3,224 participants (mean age 61 6 9 years, 54% women), 98 experienced IIS (mean
follow-up of 9.8 [62.2] years). In model 1, ln–C-reactive protein (ln-CRP) (HR 1.28, 95% confi-
dence interval [CI] 1.04–1.56), ln–tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (ln-TNFR2) (HR 1.33, 95%
CI 1.09–1.63), ln–total homocysteine (ln-tHcy) (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.11–1.58), and vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.07–1.46) were associated with risk of
IIS. All associations, except for ln-CRP, remained significant in model 2 (ln-TNFR2: HR 1.24, 95%
CI 1.02–1.51; ln-tHcy: HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.01–1.43; and VEGF: HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.04–1.42).
The addition of these 4 biomarkers to the clinical Framingham Stroke Risk Profile score improved
stroke risk prediction (net reclassification improvement: 0.34, 0.12–0.57; p , 0.05).
Conclusions: Higher levels of 4 biomarkers—CRP, tHcy, TNFR2, and VEGF—increased risk of IIS
and improved the predictive ability of the Framingham Stroke Risk Profile score. Further research
is warranted to explore their role as potential therapeutic targets. Neurology® 2016;87:1206–1211

Inflammatory cascades are believed to contribute to ischemic stroke pathogenesis. Risk stratifi-
cation of persons at risk of future vascular events can separate subpopulations that would benefit
most from established and emerging primary stroke preventative therapies. Accordingly, we
related a comprehensive panel of inflammatory biomarkers to risk of incident ischemic stroke
(IIS) in a community-dwelling sample. We hypothesized that inclusion of circulating inflamma-
tory biomarkers would refine the predictive ability of the Framingham Stroke Risk Profile score.
METHODS The Framingham Offspring Cohort was enrolled in 1971, and participants have been examined every 4 to 8 years since.1
Among offspring participants attending examination cycle 7 (1998–2001; n 5 3,539 participants), we measured a broad list of
inflammatory biomarkers. In the present analysis, we excluded participants without biomarker data (n 5 209) or available follow-
up (n 5 7), and those with TIA/stroke (n 5 99), resulting in a sample size of 3,224 participants.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents. The Boston University Medical Campus reviewed the study,
and all participants provided informed consent.

 Clinical characteristics. Components of the Framingham
Stroke Risk Profile were used as baseline covariates.2 These
include age, sex, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive therapy,
diabetes mellitus, smoking status, cardiovascular disease, and
atrial fibrillation. Clinical variables were measured at examination
cycle 7. Prevalent diabetes mellitus was defined as a fasting blood
glucose $126 mg/dL or use of oral hypoglycemic agents/insulin.
Current smoking was defined as self-reported smoking of $1 cigarette
per day within the year preceding examination. Medication use
was ascertained by self-report. Nonstroke cardiovascular disease
was defined as coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease,
and/or heart failure.
Biomarkers. We investigated a set of 15 biomarkers represent-
ing various components of the inflammatory cascade, including
systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin
6, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, tumor necrosis factor a,
tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 [TNFR2], osteoprotegerin,
and fibrinogen), vascular inflammation/endothelial dysfunction
(intercellular adhesion molecule 1, CD40 ligand, P-selectin,
lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 mass and activity, total
homocysteine [tHcy], and vascular endothelial growth factor
[VEGF]), and oxidative stress (myeloperoxidase).
Methods of measurement and intra-assay coefficients of var-
iation were all ,10% as previously reported.3
Outcomes. The primary outcome of interest was IIS occurring
between examination 7 and December 31, 2010. Stroke surveil-
lance methods and protocol for determining the diagnosis and
type of stroke have previously been published.2,4
Events were ascertained by $2 neurologists via consensus.
Adjudicators were blinded to biomarker levels.
Stroke was defined as acute-onset focal neurologic deficit of
vascular origin that persisted for .24 hours. All available clinical,
laboratory, imaging, and autopsy data were used in the adjudica-
tion process. Using this information, it was possible to classify
stroke subtypes as follows: atherosclerotic brain infarction,
including large vessel atherothrombotic and lacunar infarction,
and cerebral embolus (CE) from a documented cardiac source.
Statistical analyses. Descriptive statistics were obtained for all
variables. Natural logarithmic (ln) transformation was performed
on biomarkers that had skewed distribution. To facilitate compar-
isons, all biomarkers were standardized to a mean of 0 and an SD
of 1. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate haz-
ard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association
between each biomarker and risk of IIS. HRs are presented per 1-SD
increment of biomarker. Our primary model (model 1) was adjusted
for age and sex. Model 2 additionally adjusted for the remaining
Framingham Stroke Risk Profile variables (systolic blood pressure,
hypertension treatment, current smoking, diabetes, cardiovascular
disease, and atrial fibrillation). Additional exploratory models were
used to assess the relationship between individual biomarkers and
ischemic stroke subtypes.
To assess improvement in IIS risk prediction, we compared
a baseline model that contained Framingham Stroke Risk Profile
variables to a model that additionally contained all biomarkers
that showed a statistically significant association with IIS in our
main analysis. We calculated both the relative integrated discrim-
ination improvement and the continuous net reclassification
improvement (NRI) and their 95% bootstrap CIs for models pre-
dicting 10-year IIS risk. All analyses were performed using SAS
version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). A p value ,0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
RESULTS Of the 3,539 Framingham offspring par-
ticipants attending examination cycle 7, 3,224 partic-
ipants met our eligibility criteria for analysis within
the current study. Baseline characteristics of the sam-
ple are shown in table 1. The mean age of the sample
was 616 9 years and 54% were women. During a mean
follow-up of 9.3 (62.2) years, 98 participants (3%)
experienced an IIS.
In our primary model, ln-CRP (HR 1.28, 95% CI
1.04–1.56), ln-TNFR2 (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.09–
1.63), ln-tHcy (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.11–1.58), and
VEGF (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.07–1.46) were associ-
ated with risk of IIS (table 2). All associations, except
for ln-CRP, remained statistically significant in model
2 (ln-TNFR2: HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.02–1.51; ln-
tHcy: HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.01–1.43; and VEGF:
HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.04–1.42). The HRs for these
biomarkers were similar across individual ischemic
stroke subtypes (table e-1 at Neurology.org).

 Of all 4 individual biomarkers, the addition of
VEGF to the clinical Framingham Stroke Risk Profile
provided the greatest discriminatory ability (NRI:
0.27 [0.03–0.50], p value ,0.05); however, inclusion
of all 4 biomarkers led to the greatest improvement in
ischemic stroke risk prediction (NRI: 0.34 [0.12–
0.57], p value ,0.05) (table 3).
Exploratory analyses investigating the association
between biomarkers and individual ischemic stroke
subtypes additionally demonstrated significant associ-
ations between ln-CRP (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.03–
1.69) and atherosclerotic brain infarction, as well as
interleukin 6 (HR 1.01, 95% CI 1.06–1.33) and
fibrinogen (HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.06–1.86) and CE,
in model 1. Only the association between interleukin
6 and CE remained significant in model 2 (table e-1).
DISCUSSION Our results suggest that circulating bio-
markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction
are associated with IIS in stroke-free community-
dwelling individuals and they can be used to refine
stroke prediction models. Inclusion of 4 biomarkers
(CRP, TNFR2, tHcy, and VEGF) in a model
that
contained
the
Framingham
Stroke
Risk
Profile components resulted in an NRI of 0.34
(0.12–0.57).
VEGF was the circulating biomarker that had the
greatest individual degree of discrimination for future
ischemic stroke. Data from the Framingham Study
have recently demonstrated an association between
VEGF and IIS.5 The relation between VEGF and
ischemic stroke pathogenesis is, however, not well
established. Upregulation of VEGF may be a protec-
tive measure in the face of advanced systemic/cerebral
vascular disease by way of its neuroprotective and
beneficial angiogenic properties.5 Alternatively, it
may be pathogenic, for instance through the potenti-
ation of atherosclerotic disease. Of note, the use of
VEGF inhibitors does not seem to influence stroke
risk in patients with macular degeneration.6 This
observation would suggest an indirect rather than
causal link between VEGF and future stroke.

 Total homocysteine and CRP are well-established
markers of increased stroke risk, the former via its role
in accelerated atherosclerotic disease,7 and the latter
marking systemic inflammation and plaque instability.8
Elevated CRP levels and associated single-nucleotide
polymorphisms were also recently reported to predict
recurrent stroke in Vitamin Intervention for Stroke
Prevention trial participants.9 We demonstrated an
independent association between TNFR2 and IIS risk.
A prior observational study did not demonstrate an
independent relationship between TNF-a and future
stroke10; however, preliminary data have shown lower
vascular events in patients with rheumatoid arthritis on
TNF-a inhibitors, particularly in patients with longer
duration of use,11 and characterizing the protective
effects of TNF inhibitors in stroke patients, as well as
animal models of ischemic cerebral injury, is an active
and promising area of research.12
Our study is not without limitations. Observational
data, even when longitudinal, are prone to residual con-
founding and cannot establish direct causal relation-
ships. However, establishing causation was not the
primary aim of our study, but rather our interest was
to define the predictive utility of circulating biomarkers.
The predominant European descent of Framingham
Heart Study participants limits generalization to other
ethnic groups. We analyzed circulating biomarkers at
only one point in time and we have not accounted
for concurrent infection, renal impairment, chronic
inflammatory diseases/rheumatologic disease, or malig-
nancy that could have altered our results. Moreover, we
have not accounted for stroke preventative therapies
(such as statins), or underlying cerebral small vessel dis-
ease, which could have influenced the risk of IIS and
inflammatory biomarker levels.
The exploratory analyses investigating the rela-
tionship between circulating biomarkers and ischemic
stroke subtypes were largely limited by small sample
size and multiple testing and should be considered
hypothesis-generating. Nevertheless, the association
between fibrinogen and CE is supported by prior
observations from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Com-
munities Study demonstrating greater risk of atrial
fibrillation–related
mortality
and
cardiovascular
outcomes with higher fibrinogen levels,13 as well as
observations from the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke
Prevention trial.9 A final limitation is that we have not
identified clinically significant threshold values that
predict the risk of IIS.
Our study demonstrates improved predictive abil-
ity of the Framingham Stroke Risk Profile score for
IIS through the addition of 4 circulating biomarkers
of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. Future
research investigating whether any of these bio-
markers could serve as therapeutic targets for primary
stroke prevention is warranted.
