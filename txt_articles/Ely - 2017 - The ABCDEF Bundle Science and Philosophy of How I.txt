Abstract
Over the past 20 years, critical care has matured in a myriad of ways resulting in dramatically 
higher survival rates for our sickest patients. For millions of new survivors comes de novo 
suffering and disability called the Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS). Patients with PICS are 
robbed of their normal cognitive, emotional, and physical capacity and cannot resume their 
previous life. The ICU Liberation Collaborative is a real-world quality improvement (QI) 
initiative being implemented across 76 ICUs designed to engage strategically the ABCDEF bundle 
through team- and evidence-based care. This article explains the science and philosophy of 
liberating ICU patients and families from harm that is both inherent to critical illness and 
iatrogenic. ICU Liberation is an extensive program designed to facilitate implementation of the 
Pain, Agitation, and Delirium (PAD) guidelines, using the evidence-based ABCDEF Bundle. 
Participating ICU teams adapt data from hundreds of peer-reviewed studies to operationalize a 
systematic and reliable methodology that shifts ICU culture from the harmful inertia of sedation 
and restraints to an animated ICU filled with patients who are awake, cognitively engaged, and 
mobile with family members engaged as partners with the ICU team at the bedside. In so doing, 
patients are liberated from iatrogenic aspects of care that threaten her or his sense of self-worth 
and human dignity. The goal of this 2017 plenary lecture at the 47th SCCM Congress is to provide 
clinical ICU teams a synthesis of the literature that led to the creation of ICU Liberation 
philosophy and to explain how this patient- and family-centered, QI program is novel, 
generalizable, and practice-changing.

Author’s note: (to appear at the front of the paper)
One thing most physicians detest is being told what to do or seeing some “recipe” put forth for their patients’ medical care. We know 
what we do is a professional calling and an art; we are not merely medical providers or technicians. ICU Liberation is not meant as a 
recipe or a “protocol” to be blindly followed. Quite the opposite. Some of you may, without reading this synthesis, practice up-to-date 
and seamless ICU care. If so, then the science and philosophy of ICU Liberation are yours and this manuscript will be of help perhaps 
as a way of “packaging” what you already do. However, having visited many hundreds of ICUs around the world, I have not seen even 
one (including those in which I am privileged to serve patients and their families as an attending) that I think practices these ICU 
Liberation concepts well enough.

Prologue
“I had septic shock 4 years ago from urosepsis and I’m in my 50s. I am writing 
because I have never felt like myself again. I can’t think clearly, my memory has 
suffered. I am fatigued like never before. Before sepsis I was active, hiking, biking, 
rock climbing, running and now I am sedentary. I have seen doctor after doctor and 
they look at me like I am nuts. Maybe I am not the only one. This has affected 
every aspect of my life, I even had to leave my job as an ICU nurse because it was 
wearing me out – I couldn’t handle it which kills me. I am that nurse you gave your 
hard patients to, the difficult families, hard traumas. Not anymore. I just can’t 
handle it. Do you have any advice for me? What doctors to see? How to explain 
what is going on with me? Meds? Any treatments to get back to where I was? Or 
Doctors that specialize in post sepsis treatments. I need help.”
ICU Survivor who wrote to www.icudelirium.org in 
2016
I will never forget my horror as a resident in 1992, standing at a 28-year old patient’s 
bedside and looking at his massive anasarca while we were attempting to increase his 
oxygen delivery. Showing him to my attending, I asked if we could slow down his IV fluids 
and change his ventilator settings. She quipped, “I don’t give a rat’s ass how he looks; we 
haven’t achieved our target D dot O 2 yet, and his I:E ratio isn’t where we need it.” (1, 2) 
This sedated, paralyzed, and immobilized patient went on to survive, but the severe myositis 
ossificans and heterotopic ossification he developed during ICU admission prevented him 
from being able to resume his life as an active young man. What’s worse is that I as his 
physician had no ‘eye’ on the long-term dismantling of his life and no awareness that I had 
contributed to his demise.
Half Century Build-Up: Evolution of the Science and Philosophy of ICU 
Liberation
“We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to 
arrive where we started and know the place for the first time.” -T.S. Eliot.
Critical Care was a nascent field some 50 years ago, with Ashbaugh Bigelow Petty and 
Levine’s pivotal 1967 Lancet article describing ARDS. (3) The now recognized iatrogenic 
component to ARDS’s evolution (4) and resolution (5) has a poignant message that is 
relevant to the core points I will address in this manuscript about our capacity to add insult 
to injury.

 Let’s divide the 50 years of our field into its two quarter centuries. At the end of the first ~25 
years, the science and philosophy of ICU Medicine had evolved by the early 1990s into the 
following thought process in our minds as intensivists: “This patient has sepsis, so according 
to our appropriately strict visitation policy, his wife and loved ones will mostly be in a 
waiting area away from the bedside while we sedate and paralyze him in a state of 
suspended animation for the next 4 to 10 days [again Petty taught us (6)]. We will unveil a 
mighty arsenal of tools from our trade to fix ‘things.’ Then, when we judge that he’s better, 
we’ll allow him to wake up and stutter back into life. I’m not sure what the family is going 
to get back as a husband once this is over, but dealing with his aftermath is not really my job. 
My complicated job is to get her husband into the living column at whatever cost.”
We have matured as a field since then, and indeed we “stand on the shoulders of giants.” 
Thus, the first quarter century made possible the second 25 years of science. The current 
philosophy of critical care in 2017 could be expressed as follows: “This woman has sepsis 
with septic shock, and we have put her on medicines to fight infection and placed her on life 
support. She is stabilizing, and since we know that the initially helpful aspects of sedation 
and mechanical ventilation can at some point contribute to slowing her recovery or even 
injuring her if overused, we will actively test her every day so that she can show us when it 
is safe to liberate her from both. In the meantime, we are going to do all that we can to keep 
her pain free and give her only as much sedation as is required to cover her anxiety.(7, 8) We 
want her family and friends to be present at the bedside to help us care for her and to keep 
her oriented and urge her to work with our team to get out of the bed and begin walking as 
soon as possible. After ICU discharge, we will hopefully be able to see her back in our Post-
ICU Clinic to help transition through the long-term sequelae of critical illness that she will 
be experiencing.”
In the ICU, a patient’s clinical course can be loosely divided into the “front end” and “back 
end” of care. Throughout the ‘80s and ‘90s, our focus was almost exclusively on improving 
the front end: for example, how we diagnosed and treated different forms of shock or 
managed complex forms of mechanical ventilation. The maturation of the “front end” 
ultimately shifted patients more often from death to life (9)…but to what life? (10) The first 
two decades of the 21th century have increasingly been focused on improving survivorship 
globally. (11, 12) An immense amount of research has now been conducted on the “back 
end” of critical care, that is, the period of time after initial medical stabilization of our 
patients, forward through the remainder of their hospital stay and into their return home.
The “What” of ICU Liberation
The patient is to be liberated from anything that threatens his or her sense of self-worth, 
identity and human dignity. This is perhaps especially important during the dying phase of 
our patients. (13, 14) Despite benevolent intentions, we have created a culture in many ICUs 
that threatens patient ability to maintain dignity and return to the life they knew. An 
abundance of data summarized in the Pain Agitation Delirium (PAD) guidelines (15, 16) 
have emerged that provide a convincing evidence-based path for ICU clinicians to liberate 
patients efficiently and reliably from iatrogenic harm as they recover from critical illness. To 
harness evidence and translate it reliably into the practice setting, an interprofessional group

 of critical care practitioners in 3 regions of the United States (sponsored by the Gordon and 
Betty Moore Foundation for this first phase of work) were charged with leading the SCCM’s 
ICU Liberation Collaborative, a large scale quality improvement (QI) program to 
implement the PAD Guidelines. In total 108 applications were received and 67 adult and 9 
pediatric ICUs who met acceptance criteria were invited to participate (Figure 1). The ICU 
Liberation (www.iculiberation.org) and Thrive (www.sccm.org) initiatives, 2 linked 
programs of the SCCM designed to be synergistic, present innovative strategies to 
operationalize the published evidence with regard to how ICU and post-ICU care can be 
restructured to help mitigate the Post Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS). (17, 18)
What this is NOT: ICU Liberation is not a static construct or cook-book medicine or a set of 
protocols to be rigidly applied. Indeed, overly rigid adherence to a protocol can have 
unintended consequences such as delayed extubation for patients who spend days barely 
failing a firmly applied F/Vt threshold and thus don’t move on to and SBT.(19) Clinical 
judgment is still needed in decision making. ICU Liberation is not a situation where one set 
of people think they know better than others—excellent quality improvement engages all 
members of an interprofessional team. The idea in ICU Liberation is to generate a 
framework that is updated in real time as new data emerge, adapted to individual 
institutional preferences and needs, and implemented globally. The concepts were designed 
to help all types of ICU programs with varying patient populations (small and large, 
community and academic, public and governmental institutions) across nations to achieve 
enduring change at the bedside, which can be extremely difficult.
In medicine there is resistance to change until we see consistency of message. Whether an 
early adopter or a laggard,(20) change in medical practice most readily occurs when data are 
consistent across study types and patient populations. This consistency is precisely what 
ICU Liberation was built on, both at the level of original randomized trials conducted on 
individual bundle elements and with regard to the data once these elements were bundled 
and studied together.(21, 22)
The “Why” of ICU Liberation
The most salient aspects of post-ICU human suffering, encapsulated by PICS, are 
pronounced decline in our patients’ cognitive, emotional, mental health, and physical 
abilities. These ICU-acquired brain and body disabilities dismantle ICU survivors’ lives. The 
knowledge that a severe polymyoneuropathy occurs during critical illness was revealed by 
investigators like Bolton and Latronico (to mention just two) in ‘80s and ‘90s.(23–25) This 
“neck down” problem following critical illness is referred to as ICU-acquired weakness 
(ICU-AW),(26) and its epidemiology and significance have subsequently been more 
concretely documented.(27–29) Its bookend, which was also discovered in the ‘90s, is a 
profound “neck-up” long-term cognitive impairment or critical illness brain injury, (30–32) 
the epidemiology and severity of which have also been further understood phenotypically to 
be an acquired dementia-like injury found similarly in surgical and medical patients (33) and 
on par with Alzheimer’s disease and traumatic brain injury.(33–36) Critical illness brain 
injury is the most personal aspect of PICS, and the type of injury for which almost 90% of 
patients say they would forgo our interventions altogether.(37) Tasker and Menon wrote,

 “The most salutary lesson of intensive care over the last decade—the minimization of 
iatrogenic injury—perhaps applies more to the brain than any other organ.”(38) The full 
weight of the public health implications of PICS brings to light the “why” of ICU 
Liberation, including not only ICU-AW and long-term cognitive impairment, but also 
attendant depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), personal and societal costs, and 
family/caregiver burden.(39–44)
The “Construction” of ICU Liberation and the ABCDEF Bundle
By its very nature, the ABCDEF Bundle (45–47) is not a fixed construct, but a living/
breathing and thus evolving approach to the back end of critical illness that presents a 
framework upon which to adopt new data [similar to how other bundled ICU lists can 
change with new data (48, 49)] keeping the patient’s needs as the ultimate goal. Figure 2 
(47) is a schematic to outline showing that symptoms of pain, agitation, and delirium are to 
be monitored routinely using valid and reliable tools as recommended by the evidence-based 
PAD guidelines. These guidelines are scheduled to be updated in 2017, and those updated 
guidelines will be used to identify any needed modifications to ICU Liberation for the 
bedside ICU team.
While there are hundreds of manuscripts that contributed to the “build” of the ABCDEF 
Bundle (see slide sets at http://www.iculiberation.org/Bundles/Pages/default.aspx), for 
brevity this overview will present just those from the 3 highest impact clinical journals: 
Lancet, JAMA, and New England Journal of Medicine. From the outset, let me point out two 
caveats about this approach, which I adopted both to stress the degree of high impact 
literature that formed the bundle and to respect the journal’s request against citing several 
hundred publications. First, as with all aspects in medicine, there are aspects of this field 
about which reasonable doubt remains, often raised in less substantive publications not cited 
here. Second, most of the literature that I cite in the paragraph below is from randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs). This is not to say that RCTs are to be uniformly treated as “gold 
standards.” There can be limitations in such trials derived from the generalizability of 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, management of the control group, and overly-valued surrogate 
outcomes chosen as primary endpoints. Other aspects of doubt and errant use of the bundle 
are discussed below in the “Dosing” subheading.
The only section of the bundle that doesn’t have references in these high-impact journals is 
the “A” related to “Assessment, Prevention, Management of Pain.” Having said that, no 
one in medicine would deny the importance of starting with pain relief as the most basic 
element of what clinicians must provide in service to ICU patients. The “B” stands for Both 
SATs and SBTs (Spontaneous Awakening Trials and Spontaneous Breathing Trials) as well 
as their coordination between nurses and respiratory therapists; it is supported by data 
demonstrating large reductions in mortality and length of stay.(50–52) “C” calls for special 
attention to Choice of Sedation and Analgesia, and it is supported by numerous 
investigations that en masse reveal that patients spend less time on the ventilator and are 
more likely to be delirium free if maintained at an “awake and alert” arousal level or lightly 
sedated using medications other than GABA-ergic benzodiazepines.(53–58) The “D” 
reminds that Delirium Assessment, Prevention, and Management (59–61) will allow

 detection of otherwise missed “quiet” delirium and trigger patient-centered interventions to 
reduce the duration of brain organ dysfunction via adherence to each of the various aspects 
of the bundle elements. “E” points to Early Mobility and Exercise representing both the 
oldest and the newest piece of the bundle, since it was used, abandoned, and is now on the 
rise again (Figure 3A–C).(27–29, 62–65) This aspect of the bundle requires an up-front 
investment by the team (and not just therapists but most importantly the nurses, as mobility 
is considered a primary role of the nursing profession). This new way to work is at times 
more challenging because it involves actively getting patients off sedation and out of bed 
while still intubated. The lives of patients are at the heart of what motivates us, and this up-
front investment can reap tremendous rewards for our patients later when they are able to 
return home with their “selves” intact. The “F” of Family Engagement and Empowerment 
was the latest addition to the bundle and was sparked by the Gordon and Betty Moore 
Foundation, who served as the sponsor of this program. Robust literature exists regarding 
family involvement in the ICU that provided for its logical inclusion into all facets of ICU 
Liberation.(44, 66–68)
What is helpful about this list (50–68) of investigations that served as the basis for the 
individual pieces of the “packaged” bundle (45–47) is that once studied together, the 
literature shows a consistent message of improvement in patient outcomes. (21, 22, 69–74) It 
is beyond the scope of this manuscript to review all of these ”bundle” studies, so I will focus 
on just four: (1) In 2014, Balas et al. (21) published a single center study that demonstrated 
bundle implementation was associated with a 3 day improvement in ventilator free days 
(p=0.04), 15% less days delirious (p=0.003), improvements in multiple measures of ICU 
mobilization (p=0.005), and higher 28-day hospital survival (p=0.04). (2) In 2015, Klompas 
and colleagues (72) published a study sponsored by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) 
that included 20 ICUs and 5,164 consecutive ventilator days. This “wake up and breathe” 
collaborative was essentially built on the original ABC portions of the bundle and 
demonstrated that use of the ABCs resulted in 37% fewer ventilator-associated events 
(VAEs) and 65% fewer infection-related ventilator-associated complications (IVACs). (3) 
Trogrlic and his team (69) conducted a meta-analysis of implementation strategies for 
reducing ICU delirium and found from the 21 studies included that programs with 6 or more 
bundle elements (exactly the same number of elements as the ABCDEFs) resulted in 
statistically lower mortality and shorter lengths of ICU stay. (4) Perhaps the most impressive 
of all is the multi-site Sutter investigation by Barnes-Daly (22) published in this issue of 
Critical Care Medicine that studied over 6,000 patient days and showed a dose-response to 
ABCDEF bundle implementation. After adjusting for age, APACHE II, and mechanical 
ventilation, multivariable analysis showed that every 10% increase in compliance with the 
ABCDEF bundle predicted both a 15% higher chance of survival and of being delirium and 
coma free the following day.
The “Dosing” of ICU Liberation and the ABCDEF Bundle
It is a certainty that some hospitals will implement “new protocols” and not see an 
improvement in outcomes. Very important contributions to the field in this regard are derived 
from trials by Mehta, (75) Moss, (76) and Morris (77) that represent excellent examples of 
how changes in compliance with different elements of the ABCDEFs or differences in 
Ely

 implementation strategies can alter and even erase outcome benefits seen in earlier trials. 
Sometimes neutral outcome benefits are seen despite high compliance, which indicates 
either that prior to the QI effort the system was already doing what was newly protocolized 
(78) or that the protocol doesn’t work in their specific patient population. (79) More 
common in the real world clinical setting, however, is that hospitals make a decision “on 
paper” to make practice changes that never really make it to the bedside (i.e., low 
compliance). The “dose” of the ABCDEFs matters, as shown beautifully in the study 
appearing in this issue of CCM by Barnes-Daly.(22) We can expect that when, for example, 
we design a program to reduce exposure to benzodiazepines or extubate patients who pass 
spontaneous breathing trials, patient outcomes will stay the same (i.e., not improve) if 
compliance with those elements is not high. Burry and colleagues, about their study 
incorporating 712 patients and over 3,500 patient-days, wrote: “We found that nearly all 
patients were managed with continuous-infusion opioids and sedatives. We also found that 
actual practice was different from what we expected because the available clinical tools – 
such as protocols and assessment scales – were not necessarily applied at the bedside.” (80) 
An example of high compliance and good results is provided by repetitive studies at Johns 
Hopkins, where most elements of the ABCDEFs are being tested and shown consistently to 
improve outcomes, (73, 81, 82) speaking to the fact that even world-class institutions can 
improve and must continue to strive towards excellence. In their most recent publication 
from 327 patients, Kamdar and colleagues found key modifiable items that slashed patients’ 
likelihood of participation in physical therapy were higher use of benzodiazepines and 
sedative drips and presence of delirium. Complementing these findings directly, Michigan’s 
51 hospital Keystone ICU Collaborative showed that higher dose implementation of 
spontaneous awakening trials and delirium screening yielded a tripling of the likelihood of 
exercising patients on mechanical ventilation.(83) In the same study, incomplete or non-
sequential bundle implementation yielded lower success rates. The authors concluded that 
these findings were “another layer of evidence that for the ABCDE[F]s, the whole is greater 
than sum of the parts.”
The “How” of ICU Liberation
What is clear is that adopting the science of ICU Liberation involves a difficult adoption 
process that must include philosophy and culture. Working gradually, through the process of 
change to employ these interventions, serves patients and their families by mitigating 
downstream disabilities caused by illness and iatrogenic harm. (74, 84) Some of the most 
successful hospitals to achieve lasting change have been the small community hospitals, 
which are nimble and readily embrace the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) 
concept of “small tests of change” and plan, do, study, act (PDSA) cycles. (84) rather than 
trying to “launch” a wholesale revamping of interprofessional rounds. On the other hand, 
major hospital systems such as Kaiser Permanente, (74) which participated in the IHI’s 
Rethinking Critical Care Collaborative, (84) have harnessed network abilities to accomplish 
large scale QI projects similar to that designed by Klompas in his CDC initiative.(72) 
Through both IHI and SCCM collaboratives, teams are taught to avoid the pitfall of trying to 
“climb Mt. Everest” and instead to maintain the simple mantra of starting one patient at a 
time using small tests of change and adopting IHI’s widely used “what can you do by

 Tuesday” motif. This approach builds good will for the entire team by seeing the work in 
action initially on an individual patient level. Starting with perhaps just 2 or 3 people and a 
single patient (either on or off a ventilator since “liberation” is applicable ICU-wide), 
ABCDEF bundle concepts including assessing for and managing pain, both SATs and SBTs, 
choice of drug, delirium monitoring, early mobility, and family involvement are applied at 
the bedside. From that experience, things are tweaked the following day and others are 
brought into the conversation so that ultimately a culture of ICU Liberation is endorsed by 
all members of the interprofessional ICU team including the nurse, respiratory therapist, 
pharmacist, physical and occupational therapists, social worker, chaplain, nurse practitioner 
or physician assistant, and physician.
Overcoming Negligence as a Global ICU Community
Why would it be that a 2014 point prevalence study from 116 ICUs in Germany would 
report that only 2% of patients requiring mechanical ventilation stood beside the bed and 
only 1% marched in place or walked? (85) If this is what is happening in a country with one 
of the most advanced systems of healthcare on the planet, what is happening elsewhere? 
Some of our most senior statesmen in Critical Care have called us out regarding what can be 
thought of as negligence on our part. Both Petty (6) and Clemmer (86) ask, “What are we 
doing and why are we so slow to change?” Clemmer frankly states that we should be 
frustrated by our attitudes and actions towards change with regard to oversedation, delirium, 
and sleep. We are either too convinced that our practice is correct and adequate or that 
nothing within reason can be done to alter our patients’ path forward. We think that patients 
will be too uncomfortable or have bad memories, when the lion’s share of data challenging 
these assumptions demonstrates this to be false. What the ICU community now realizes is 
that in many ways what we effectively need is to awaken in our minds key elements of ICU 
care that we used to endorse long ago, but which were lost and are now reentering our 
practice some 50 years later. (87) This degree of change mandates a great degree of humility 
and openness to the fact that we are part of the patients’ problem in and following the ICU.
Next Steps and Future Directions
Advances in our knowledge must continue to be made in many areas. For example, what is 
the optimal pharmacologic strategy to sedate agitated older patients or those with baseline 
deficits in neuropsychological function? (88) Bridging between overlapping areas of the 
PAD (15) and sepsis (89) guidelines has finally occurred (e.g., the “B” of the ABCDEFs 
appears in both guidelines as a Grade A recommendation). Moving forward, it would be 
appropriate to use the new Sepsis-3 definitions (90, 91) to determine the relative benefit of 
ICU Liberation for those with and without sepsis. The ability to conduct both QI projects 
and dissemination and implementation research globally must expand via more language 
availability of the spectrum of tools and information available on highly trafficked websites 
(www.iculiberation.org and www.icudelirium.org). Delirium assessment tools are already 
present in more than 30 languages, yet the other elements of the ABCDEF bundle could be 
adapted for use in under-resourced areas and studied. There is need for more in-depth 
qualitative study of critical care’s shift from a strict focus on pathophysiology and 
resuscitation to those aspects of ICU-medicine such as long-term physical, emotional, and

 cognitive rehabilitation plus psychologically sensitive aspects of personhood explored in the 
ICU adaption of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.(92) Lastly, we need a greater understanding 
of the role of Post-ICU Clinics.(93–95)
Concluding Thoughts
Andrew Wyeth’s painting, “Christina’s World,” carries the enduring message of Christina 
Olson and her perseverance despite great adversity brought on by a severe neuromuscular 
disease variant of Charcot-Marie-Tooth. It is a wake-up call that Christina Olson’s main 
recollection of her medical evaluations in Boston in the early 1900s was that the teams of 
doctors were so focused on the academics of making the diagnosis that they completely 
overlooked her as a person. I know I have done the same thing. The body of literature over 
the past 20 years that has been used to build the ABCDEF bundle and the ICU Liberation 
collaborative will help us avoid this pitfall in moving forward.
The most productive aspect of the philosophy of ICU Liberation for us as clinicians is that it 
shifts our focus from the monitors, beeps and buzzers to a human connection. The holistic 
approach to ICU Liberation also includes providing a comfortable and dignified dying 
process via early use of palliative care for our patients who will not be able to survive their 
critical illness. SCCM’s ICU Liberation is about magnifying human dignity and helping to 
preserve self-worth in patients who during the course of critical illness feel threats to both.

 Figure 2. ICU Liberation Schematic Depicting Symptoms, Monitoring Tools, and ABCDEF 
Rounding Checklist
ICU Liberation is a quality improvement program geared towards reducing symptoms of 
pain, agitation, and delirium (PAD) that threaten patients’ sense of self-worth and dignity. 
These symptoms of suffering are monitored using valid and reliable tools, and the culture is 
shaped using the evidence-based ABCDEF bundle as a rounding checklist. These concepts 
are based on hundreds of peer-reviewed studies including over 30 from JAMA, Lancet, and 
NEJM.

 Figure 3. Visual Examples Over Time of Early Mobility in Mechanically Ventilated ICU Patients
A. San Francisco General in 1970 (left) – Mobilizing an intubated ICU patient with 
primitive equipment. After this period of early mobilization in the ICU, there was a 
progressive move away from awake and ambulatory patients while on the ventilator towards 
heavily sedated and restrained patients for days on end to help prevent awareness and reduce 
memories of ICU stay. (Courtesy of Heidi Engel PT, DPT and Michael Gropper, MD with 
permission from the patient and institution)
B. University of California San Francisco (UCSF) in 2015 (middle) – Mobilizing an 
intubated patient with advanced equipment including monitors and pumps. This patient 
provides a visual example of the incorporation of ICU Liberation and the ABCDEF bundle 
within the same city as Fig. A yet 45 years later, following the ongoing renaissance of ICU 
mobilization. She serves to counter the idea that only simple patients should be ambulated. 
This 54 year old woman had acute myelogenous leukemia with chronic graft versus host 
disease and emphysema. She presented with acute on chronic hypoxemic and hypercarbic 
respiratory failure. Once on mechanical ventilation, she began ambulating to the edge of the 
bed on day 2 with family to reassure and calm her. On day 3, she transferred to chair
