Abstract
Background—Although an association between adolescent sleep and substance use is supported 
by the literature, few studies have characterized the longitudinal relationship between early 
adolescent sleep and subsequent substance use. The current study examined the prospective 
association between the duration and quality of sleep at age 11 and alcohol and cannabis use 
throughout adolescence.
Methods—The present study, drawn from a cohort of 310 boys taking part in a longitudinal study 
in Western Pennsylvania, includes 186 boys whose mothers completed the Child Sleep 
Questionnaire; sleep duration and quality at age 11 were calculated based on these reports. At ages 
20 and 22, participants were interviewed regarding lifetime alcohol and cannabis use. Cox 
proportional hazard analysis was used to determine the association between sleep and substance 
use.
Results—After accounting for race, socioeconomic status, neighborhood danger, active 
distraction, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems, both the duration and quality of

 sleep at age 11 were associated with multiple earlier substance use outcomes. Specifically, less 
sleep was associated with earlier use, intoxication, and repeated use of both alcohol and cannabis. 
Lower sleep quality was associated with earlier alcohol use, intoxication, and repeated use. 
Additionally, lower sleep quality was associated with earlier cannabis intoxication and repeated 
use, but not first use.
Conclusions—Both sleep duration and sleep quality in early adolescence may have implications 
for the development of alcohol and cannabis use throughout adolescence. Further studies to 
understand the mechanisms linking sleep and substance use are warranted.

1. INTRODUCTION
Despite efforts to curb adolescent substance use, alcohol use remains high and cannabis use 
has been increasing (Johnston et al., 2014), suggesting work is needed to understand the risk 
factors underlying substance use during this unique developmental period. Many risk factors 
are well described, including internalizing and externalizing problems (Bongers et al., 2003), 
self-regulation (Wills et al., 1995), and reward regulation (Steinberg, 2007). Sleep, 
associated with all of these factors (Gregory and O’Connor, 2002; Hasler et al., 2012a; 
Killgore et al., 2006; Pesonen et al., 2010), changes dramatically in adolescence, with 
restriction, insomnia, and delayed timing being particularly prominent (Carskadon et al., 
2004; Johnson et al., 2006). Yet despite evidence linking multiple sleep constructs to 
adolescent substance use (Bootzin and Stevens, 2005; Hasler et al., 2012b; McKnight-Eily et 
al., 2011; Wong et al., 2015), adolescent sleep disturbance remains under-explored.
Sleep disturbance repeatedly has been linked to adolescent substance use. Cross-sectional 
studies associate sleep problems with alcohol use (Pieters et al., 2010). Sleep duration 
(McKnight-Eily et al., 2011), self-reported sleep problems (Johnson and Breslau, 2001), and 
insomnia symptoms (Roane and Taylor, 2008) all have been related to concurrent alcohol 
and cannabis use. Prospective evidence suggests that sleep disturbance precedes substance 
use. Parent reports of childhood “trouble sleeping” and “overtiredness” predicted boys’ 
alcohol and cannabis use between ages 12 and 14 (Wong et al., 2004), while adolescent self-
endorsement of these behaviors predicted subsequent illicit drug use (Wong et al., 2010). 
Insomnia in 12 to 19 year-olds was associated with alcohol use one year later (Hasler et al., 
2014). In the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, trouble falling asleep and 
decreased sleep duration were associated with subsequent illicit drug use (Wong et al., 
2015). Finally, sleep duration predicted marijuana use two years later (Pasch et al., 2012). 
This evidence suggests that pediatric sleep is associated with alcohol and cannabis use, but 
long-term longitudinal studies of adolescent sleep and substance remain rare.
To lend further credence to sleep as a risk factor for adolescent substance use, additional 
evidence of a temporal relationship between the two is required. In the present project, we 
hypothesized longitudinal associations between difficulties in early adolescent sleep and 
substance use among urban, low-income boys. We expected shorter sleep duration and worse

 sleep quality at age 11 would be associated with earlier and greater alcohol and cannabis use 
throughout adolescence after accounting for potential third variables. We focused on early 
adolescent sleep because it captures a key point when puberty-related sleep changes first 
occur (Kim et al., 2002; Knutson, 2005; Laberge et al., 2001). Additionally, we thought it 
would be informative to assess sleep before age 14 because initiating substance use by this 
age increases one’s risk of developing a substance use disorder (DeWit et al., 2000; Hingson 
et al., 2006). By examining substance use from age 12 through 22, we hope to more 
precisely describe the relationship between adolescent sleep and subsequent substance use.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Participants
Data utilized came from the Pitt Mother & Child Project, a longitudinal study on 
vulnerability, resilience, and antisocial behavior in low-socioeconomic status (SES) boys 
(Shaw et al., 2003, 1999). Unadjusted analyses include 173 and 165 boys for alcohol and 
cannabis, respectively, drawn from the originally recruited sample of 310 boys and the 
subset of 186 who completed the sleep assessment (added partway through the age 11 
assessment1). Of those 186, some were excluded from the respective analyses for missing 
data on alcohol (n=13) or cannabis (n=21). Adjusted analyses with all covariates include 145 
and 140 boys for alcohol and cannabis, respectively. Other participants were excluded from 
adjusted analyses for missing data on neighborhood danger (n=1), internalizing/
externalizing problem behavior (n=1), and active distraction (n=30). Mann-Whitney U tests 
show included and excluded participants had similar demographic characteristics at study 
onset.
2.2 Variables
2.2.1 Sleep Measures—When participants were 11, mothers completed the Child Sleep 
Questionnaire2 (CSQ), an adaptation of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; Buysse et 
al., 1989). Sleep duration was calculated by subtracting night-time wakefulness (time to fall 
asleep, waking mid-sleep, and waking up early) from estimated time in bed. The scoring 
system for sleep quality, designed to closely mimic the PSQI, summed 7 variables on a 0–3 
scale (continuous variables were recoded as Likert items) with higher numbers indicating 
worse sleep (Cronbach α=0.63). Variables included sleep duration, sleep latency, mid-sleep 
disturbance, late-sleep disturbance, maternal impression of sleep quality, day disturbance, 
and sleep efficiency.
2.2.2 Substance Use—At age 20, participants were interviewed using the Lifetime Drug 
and Alcohol Use History (Clark et al., 2001; Skinner and Sheu, 1982). Initial and later use of 
alcohol and cannabis was coded from this interview and again at age 22 to examine use 
since age 20. Of note, 22 individuals were interviewed only at age 22 due to availability; 
these participants provided information on their substance use similar to those interviewed at

 age 20. Variables included age of first use, intoxication, and repeated use, defined as the age 
when the participant used alcohol ten times or cannabis three times in a year.
2.2.3 Covariates—Minority status (coded dichotomously as White or non-White) was 
included because of sleep and substance use differences between Whites and Blacks (Chen 
and Jacobson, 2012; Chen et al., 2015). Family SES at age 11 was measured using the 
Hollingshead four-factor index score which accounts for parental marital status, education, 
occupation, and sex (Hollingshead, 1975).
Internalizing and externalizing problems were accounted for given their links to substance 
use (King et al., 2004; O’Neil et al., 2011). When participants were 11, mothers completed 
the Child Behavior Checklist, a well-established assessment of child behavior (Achenbach, 
1991). The broad-band internalizing (Cronbach α=0.86) and externalizing (Cronbach 
α=0.92) problem scores were used as covariates.
Neighborhood danger was accounted for because of greater exposure to substances and 
traumatic events for youth in high-risk neighborhoods (Lowry et al., 1999; Zinzow et al., 
2009). At age 11, mothers filled out the Me and My Neighborhood questionnaire which 
includes 18 Likert-scale items relating to neighborhood danger (e.g., “a friend was stabbed 
or shot”); higher summed scores indicate increased danger (α=0.88) (PMCP, 2001).
Emotion regulation was accounted for because of its association with substance use (Wills et 
al., 1995). At age 3.5, child behavior was coded from videotapes of a 3-minute cookie delay-
of-gratification task, in which the child has nothing to do while mother fills out a 
questionnaire and holds onto a clear bag containing a preferred cookie (Marvin, 1977). The 
number of 10-second intervals spent in active distraction, directly inversely linked to later 
child problem behavior (Gilliom et al., 2002), was used as a covariate (mean=10.92, 
SD=5.14).
2.3 Data Analysis
Cox regression was used to model the association between sleep and substance use. The 
assumption of proportional hazards was tested using Schoenfeld residuals in R 3.2.3. These 
data do not violate the assumption of proportional hazards.
Hazard models were created using SPSS 23’s “Cox Regression” function with an α=0.05 
(Table 1). Individuals were left-censored if they used the substance of interest before age 12 
(n=10 for alcohol; n=4 for cannabis). Unadjusted analyses included the sleep variables as 
continuous variables. Adjusted analyses added all covariates. To facilitate interpretation, the 
reciprocal sleep duration hazard ratios were recorded.
To graphically present results, participants were grouped based on duration (approximate 
tertiles) and quality (scores of 0–1 in the first group, scores of 2 in the second, and scores of 
3+ the third) and one-minus-survival curves for first alcohol and cannabis use were created 
(Figures 1a–1d).

 3. RESULTS
For the unadjusted alcohol analyses, less sleep duration was associated with earlier use and 
intoxication, but not repeated use. Sleep quality was not associated with any outcome. 
Adjusted analyses showed less sleep duration and lower quality were both associated with 
earlier alcohol use, intoxication, and repeated use. Greater active distraction was positively 
associated with earlier alcohol use (HR1.04, p=0.03) and repeated use (HR1.04, p=0.03) in 
the sleep duration analysis. Covariates were otherwise non-significant.
For the unadjusted cannabis analyses, less sleep duration and lower sleep quality were 
associated with earlier use, intoxication, and repeated use. Adjusted analyses showed shorter 
sleep duration was associated with all earlier outcomes. Lower sleep quality was associated 
with earlier cannabis intoxication and repeated use, but not first use. Higher externalizing 
problems were associated with earlier cannabis use (HR1.04, p=0.02) and intoxication 
(HR1.04, p=0.04) in the duration analyses and earlier cannabis use (HR1.04, p=0.046) in the 
quality analysis. Covariates were otherwise non-significant.
Of note, both quality and duration were non-significant when simultaneously used in 
regression for all analyses.
Illustrations of group-level hazard analyses (Figure 1a–1d) imply that less sleep duration and 
worse sleep quality were associated with earlier substance use.
4. DISCUSSION
These results suggest that shorter duration and lower quality of sleep are risk factors for 
alcohol and cannabis use even when accounting for important covariates. These sleep 
constructs may pre-dispose adolescents to substance use, a worrying finding considering 
early substance use is associated with a shortened time to dependence (Clark et al., 1998).
These findings are convergent with prospective studies of sleep’s predictive role in 
adolescent alcohol and cannabis use (Hasler et al., 2014; Pasch et al., 2012; Wong et al., 
2004, 2009, 2015) and a recent CDC report where lower sleep duration was associated with 
high school students’ risky behavior (Wheaton, 2016). This study is unique in linking two 
sleep constructs in early adolescence to alcohol and cannabis initiation, intoxication, and 
repeated use. As there is a dearth of literature linking early adolescent sleep to subsequent 
substance use, this study provides initial evidence for sleep’s developmental role in 
substance use.
Sleep disturbance may be an important target of interventions to decrease substance use. For 
pediatricians, these results warrant the validation of sleep-related screening tools to help 
identify at-risk adolescents. While effective behavioral treatments for sleep disturbance are 
available (Mindell and Meltzer, 2008), the area remains under-explored; these results 
highlight the need to further develop treatment strategies. These results could also suggest 
policy-level means to decrease substance use, especially as delaying school start times has 
been shown to improve sleep duration (Owens et al., 2010).

 The study includes notable limitations. Importantly, the CSQ’s internal consistency was low, 
and sleep quality and duration were moderately correlated. Additional research 
disentangling these constructs – perhaps using actigraphy and sleep diaries – would be 
informative. Participants resided in Pennsylvania where recreational cannabis use is illegal; 
thus, these results may not be generalizable to other locations. This sample consisted solely 
of low-income, urban boys, limiting generalizability to other boys and young women, 
especially given evidence that sleep does not predict girls’ alcohol and cannabis use (Wong 
et al., 2009). Although the present study controlled for multiple covariates, additional risk 
factors to substance use, including parental use, peer use, and access to substances, could not 
be included. Finally, much of our data is retrospective and subject to memory distortions.
While these results support sleep’s role in adolescent substance use, the extant literature 
indicates that future work should consider how physical and psychiatric illnesses relate to 
sleep and substance use. Prior longitudinal data links early childhood sleep problems to 
adolescent anxiety and depression (Gregory and O’Connor, 2002) and supports bidirectional 
associations between sleep problems and generalized anxiety disorder and depression in late 
childhood through adolescence (Shanahan et al., 2014). Less sleep during adolescence is 
linked to depressive symptoms, alcohol use (Pasch et al., 2010), and comorbid physical 
conditions (McKnight-Eily et al., 2011). Relatedly, active distraction and externalizing 
problems were associated with some substance use outcomes in the present study, 
suggesting future longitudinal studies should consider these variables as potential 
moderators between sleep and substance use.
In conclusion, these results indicate that sleep is an important risk factor for adolescent 
substance use. The dramatic normative changes in sleep and emerging substance use during 
adolescence indicate that this issue deserves strong attention. While more work is needed to 
understand the role of physical and mental illness, these findings suggest sleep may be a 
target to decrease substance use throughout adolescence.

 Highlights
•
Childhood sleep problems may be prospectively linked to adolescent 
substance use
•
Less sleep predicted earlier onset of alcohol and cannabis involvement
•
Worse sleep quality predicted earlier onset of alcohol and cannabis 
involvement
•
These associations generally held after accounting for various 
covariates
•
Childhood sleep is a promising target for reducing adolescent substance 
use risk

For the sake of interpretation, groups were created for both duration and quality and used in 
regression with all covariates. Earlier alcohol use was noted in groups with lower sleep 
duration (1a) and worse sleep quality (1b). Likewise, earlier cannabis use was noted in 
groups with lower sleep duration (1c) and worse sleep quality (1d).

Note. HR = Hazard Ration, CI = Confidence Interval. Adjusted analysis includes the following covariates in the model: race, socioeconomic status, 
neighborhood danger, externalizing problem behavior, internalizing problem behavior, and active distraction. Sleep duration HRs have been 
transformed by taking the reciprocal. HRs >1 indicate here that each 1 hour of less sleep duration was associated with x% earlier substance use.
