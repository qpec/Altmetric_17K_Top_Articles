Abstract 
Background: We followed up, in 2013, the subjects who lived near the Athens 
International Airport and had participated in the cross-sectional multi-country HYENA 
study in 2004-06. 
Objectives: The objective was to evaluate the association of exposure to aircraft and 
road traffic noise with the incidence of hypertension and other cardiovascular outcomes.  
Methods: From the 780 individuals who participated in the cross-sectional study, 537 
were still living in the same area and 420 accepted to participate in the follow-up. 
Aircraft and road traffic noise exposure was based on the estimations conducted in 
2004-06, linking geo-coded residential addresses of the participants to noise levels. We 
applied multiple logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for 
potential confounders. 
Results: The incidence of hypertension was significantly associated with higher aircraft 
noise exposure during the night. Specifically, the OR for hypertension per 10 dB 
increase in Lnight aircraft noise exposure was 2.63 (95% C.I. 1.21-5.71). Doctor 
diagnosed cardiac arrhythmia was significantly associated with Lnight aircraft noise 
exposure, when prevalent and incident cases were considered with an OR of 2.09 (95% 
CI 1.07, 4.08). Stroke risk was also increased with increasing noise exposure but the 
association was not significant. Twenty four hour road traffic noise associations with 
the outcomes considered were weaker and less consistent.  
Conclusions: In conclusion, our cohort study suggests that long-term exposure to 
aircraft noise, particularly during the night is associated with incident hypertension and 
possibly, also, cardiovascular effects.

What this paper adds 
• Cardiovascular health impacts of transportation-related noise are a growing 
concern among general public, especially concerning the effects of road 
traffic noise.  
• We report the results of a follow-up study in Greece, aiming to assess the 
incidence of hypertension and cardiovascular outcomes in relation to noise 
exposure. 
• The findings of this study suggest that long-term exposure to aircraft noise, 
particularly during the night is associated with incident hypertension and 
possibly, also, cardiovascular effects.  
• We anticipate that the research undertaken will be useful for improving the 
quality of public health in areas where exposure to transportation-related 
noise is prevalent.

INTRODUCTION 
There is ample evidence for auditory effects of exposure to occupational, social and 
road traffic noise. Exposure to noise has also been associated with annoyance/sleep 
disturbance [1]. Evidence is accumulating concerning effects related to increased 
prevalence or incidence of cardiovascular disease and hypertension and effects on 
cognitive performance in children[2-4]. Much of the evidence relies on cross-sectional 
studies, but some longitudinal epidemiological studies have been implemented 
especially concerning the effects of road traffic noise[5, 6]. Regarding noise from 
aircrafts, which affects populations residing near large airports, a smaller number of 
studies have reported results. The cross-sectional HYENA study, which included 
inhabitants near six large European airports, was the first European multi-city reporting 
effects of night time aircraft noise on the prevalence of hypertension[7] which was 
independent of the annoyance levels[8]. Some studies also reported acute effects of 
noise exposure on elevated BP measurements[9]; an increase in morning salivary 
cortisol in women exposed to aircraft noise[10] and a suggestive association of aircraft 
noise with the use of antihypertensive medication[11]. Other ecological studies have 
found evidence of associations with cardiovascular disease endpoints[12-15]. Short 
term experimental  studies reported evidence for effects of night-time aircraft noise on 
next day blood pressure and arterial stiffness[16, 17]. 
 
The inhabitants around the Athens International Airport "Eleftherios Venizelos" (AIA) 
formed one of the six groups studied within the context of the HYENA study. The 
representative population sample included 780 individuals and the fieldwork took place 
in 2004-6. In this paper we report the results of a follow-up study, in 2013, in the same 
individuals, aiming to assess the incidence of hypertension and cardiovascular 
outcomes in relation to noise exposure.  
 
SUBJECTS AND METHODS 
Study population and health outcomes  
AIA is located west of the Municipality of Artemida about 20 km to the east of central 
Athens.  The airport can handle 600 take-offs and landings per day. From the planning 
stage of the AIA (which started its operation in 2001), it was acknowledged that noise 
would affect the population of Artemida, thus, the HYENA study subjects were 
sampled from this population (a total of 21,488 inhabitants; Hellenic Statistical

Authority Census 2011). In order to sample subjects for the HYENA study ensuring 
noise exposure contrasts, predicted noise curves were obtained from the Airport. The 
modeling used for aircraft noise is based on Integrated Noise Model (INM) [18].  Based 
on these predictions, noise contours were drawn over the map of the study area and the 
area which was subsequently divided in three zones according to noise levels: <50dB, 
50-60dB and >60dB. Fifteen percent, 50% and 35% of subjects were sampled from 
each category respectively.  
 
Between January and September 2013, two qualified and trained interviewers visited 
the households of all 780 individuals who participated in the 2004-6 HYENA study. 
Seventy eight individuals had died (information was obtained from members of their 
household or from neighbours), 76 had moved (information from the neighbours) and 
89 could not be found. Thus 537 individuals were identified alive and living in the same 
area, and among them 420 (78%) accepted to participate in the follow-up study. There 
was slightly better participation (82%) in highest vs. lowest noise exposure categories 
(72% - see also Supplemental material: Table S1). Differences in demographic 
characteristics, life style, occupational status and household characteristics between  
individuals that agreed to participate in the follow-up study and non-participating 
residents at baseline (2004 - 2006) are shown in Table S2. Figure 1 presents the 
residential locations of the 420 participants. Those who agreed to participate were 
visited at home and a questionnaire with information on health events during the follow-
up study  (January to September 2013) (including incidence of hypertension, CVD, 
diabetes, lifestyle, occupation and annoyance following the original HYENA 
questionnaire) and household characteristics (including changes to protect from noise 
exposure) was completed by interview. Blood pressure was measured according to the 
initial HYENA protocol[7, 19] by specially trained staff who assessed BP at home 
visits. The study definition of hypertension[7] included individuals who had either BP 
levels above the WHO cutoff points (systolic BP ≥140 mmHg or diastolic BP≥90 
mmHg), [20] and/or a diagnosis of hypertension (by a physician) and were using 
antihypertensive medication, as reported in the interview questionnaire.  
 
Noise exposure assessment 
Exposure to aircraft and road traffic noise for each individual, based on the location of 
their residence, was used as estimated at the baseline [7, 19]. For the assessment of

aircraft noise, the SONDEO existing noise model engine was used[18]. The noise and 
performance databases are those provided by the INM, Version 6.1). The INM [18] was 
used in the study area to assess personal aircraft noise exposure. Modeled noise 
exposure levels were linked to each participant’s home address using geographic 
information systems[21]. 
 
To assess the effect of noise exposure on cardiovascular disease endpoints and 
hypertension, we used the A-weighted equivalent continuous noise level over T hours 
(LAeq,T) as the exposure indicator recommended by WHO [22] For aircraft noise, the 
indicators LAeq,16hr (day defined as the hours between 0700 and 2300) and Lnight 
(night defined as the hours between 2300 and 0700) were used to differentiate the 
effects of daytime and night-time exposure. 
 
Annoyance and other possible effect modifiers 
Noise annoyance (separately for the time of the day: during  daytime and night-time; 
and also separately by source: from aircrafts and road traffic) was assessed, following 
the HYENA questionnaire, through personal interviews using the 11-point ‘ICBEN 
scale’ ranging from 0 to 10 [23]. The association of annoyance and hypertension was 
evaluated, as well as the role of annoyance as mediator and potential effect modifier 
(categorized into 2 levels (0–7 vs 8–10) of the noise exposure-hypertension association.  
We evaluated possible effect modification patterns for the annoyance-hypertension 
association by window opening habits (always closed vs sometimes open), time spent 
in the living room on workdays (dichotomized by the median: ≥ 9vs < 9 hours), time 
spent in the bedroom on workdays (dichotomized by the median: ≥ 8 vs < 8 hours), 
noise reducing remedies (yes vs no) and building modifications to reduce the noise (yes 
vs no). 
 
Statistical analysis 
We applied multiple logistic regression models to investigate the risk of hypertension 
and cardiovascular (CVD) outcomes, including cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial 
infarction, stroke and diabetes following long-term noise exposure.  We also analysed 
self-reported hearing problems and doctor diagnosed hearing impairment as outcome 
variables. Two multiple logistic regression models were applied for each health 
outcome: a) including all subjects regardless of whether they were prevalent cases at

baseline and b) excluding the prevalent cases at baseline. We also applied a Cox 
proportional hazards model to take into account the time of diagnosis for hypertension, 
the most frequent outcome. Person years were assumed from baseline until the year of 
the diagnosis for the specific outcome. 
 
In all the models, we adjusted for gender (males vs females), age (years), smoking 
habits (yes vs no), body mass index (BMI; kg/m2), educational level (quartiles of years 
in education), physical activity (duration and intensity: less than once a week, 1-3 times 
a week and > 3 times a week), alcohol intake per week (number of units, where 1 unit 
= 10 mL pure ethanol) and salt intake (always adding salt to food at the table vs 
sometimes, seldom or never) at baseline. We evaluated the sensitivity of our findings 
for hypertension by including noise exposure at work (defined as “having to raise voice 
in order to communicate“) in all models. 
 
As the noise exposure variables, LAeq,16hr and Lnight , were highly correlated in our 
study area (r=0.70), they were included alternatively in the models. LAeq,24hr was 
used as the exposure variable for road traffic noise. The correlation between LAeq,24hr 
road traffic noise and Lnight, LAeq,16hr was 0.08 and 0.44 respectively. Aircraft and 
road traffic noise exposure indicators were not simultaneously introduced in the 
models.  
 
To assess effect modification, an interaction term of each potential effect modifier with 
the relevant noise exposure indicator was included in the model. 
 
We conducted mediation analysis[24] to identify whether annoyance was a mediator in 
the noise-hypertension association (i.e. if it is a step in the causal chain- entirely or 
partly responsible for the effect) and to quantify the extent to which the effect of 
exposure to aircraft noise levels on hypertension was mediated through annoyance. 
There are 3 steps in conducting mediation analysis: 1) by applying a multiple logistic 
regression model with hypertension as the outcome variable Y, Lnight aircraft noise as 
the causal variable X and adjusting for the potential confounders mentioned above; 2) 
by applying a multiple linear regression model in which the potential mediator variable 
M (annoyance from aircraft noise) is treated as the dependent variable, the causal 
variable (Lnight) as an independent variable and controlling for the same confounders;

and 3) by regressing Y on X and M and adjusting for the same confounders. For this 
purpose we used the “medeff” command in STATA version 13.  The quasi-Bayesian 
Monte Carlo algorithm[25] was applied to test the indirect effect, to determine the 
significance of mediation effects and compute the proportion of the total variance 
mediated. We report the proportion of total effects mediated, the average mediation 
effect and the corresponding 95% CIs. 
 
RESULTS 
Table 1 shows personal and household characteristics of the 420 participants. Smoking 
and alcohol drinking have decreased over the follow-up period. More participants, in 
total 57.6% reached retirement age at follow up. Noise reducing remedies and building 
modifications to reduce noise also decreased over the follow-up period. Moreover, 
99.8% of the participants were white and 72 (17.1%) were employed at the airport at 
baseline.

Table 2 presents the distribution of participants in the noise exposure categories at 
baseline. Most residents (68.4%) are exposed to a level of 50 to 60 dB regarding 
LAeq16, hr aircraft noise, 45.7% are exposed to Lnight aircraft noise between 40 and 
45 dB, while 49.3% of the participants are exposed to road traffic noise less than 40 dB. 
Table S3 presents the distribution of  annoyance.  Annoyance levels from aircraft noise 
decreased during the follow-up period. None reported annoyance from road traffic, 
trains, construction, industry, neighbours, commercial activity, indoor installations or 
any other noise source.

Table 4 presents the effect estimates for noise levels and health outcomes. Exposure to 
aircraft noise, especially night-time, was associated to total and incident hypertension. 
Specifically, the odds ratio (OR) for hypertension per 10dB Lnight aircraft noise 
exposure increase when all hypertension cases were included was 1.69 (95% C.I.: 1.01-
2.82); the OR for incident hypertension associated with the same exposure was 2.63 
(95% C.I.: 1.21-5.71).  Doctor diagnosed cardiac arrhythmia was also associated with 
Lnight, but not with LAeq,16h, but the association reached statistical significance only 
when all cases were considered (i.e. prevalent at baseline and incident) with an OR of 
2.09 (95% CI: 1.07-4.08). Stroke risk was also increased with increasing noise exposure 
at night but the association was not significant, maybe due to the very small number of 
cases. The OR for the incidence of self reported and doctor diagnosed hearing 
impairment per 10dB Lnight aircraft noise exposure was 1.97 (95% C.I.: 1.05-3.71) and 
3.51 (95% C.I.: 1.46-8.44) respectively. The estimated hazard ratio (HR) for 
hypertension, when Cox regression was applied (Table S4), associated with a 10 dB 
increase in Lnight and LAeq,16hr was 3.39 (95% C.I.: 0.87-13.3) and 1.34 (95% C.I.: 
0.57-3.16) respectively. Twenty four hour road traffic noise effect estimates were

Using mediation analysis (Table S5), the effect estimate of aircraft noise exposure on 
hypertension (all cases and incident only) was not mediated by annoyance to aircraft 
noise. The indirect effect represented the 14.2% and 1.6% of the total effect during the 
night time, for all cases and incident only, respectively. The percent of the total effect 
mediated by annoyance during the day was higher; 24.1% (all cases) and 8.2% (incident 
cases). No statistically significant effect modification of the noise exposure-
hypertension association by annoyance was observed (p-value>0.05). 
 
 
 
DISCUSSION 
In this prospective cohort study we observed elevated risks for hypertension, 
arrhythmia and stroke associated to aircraft noise exposure, especially during the night. 
No association was observed between noise exposure and the risk of MI or diabetes. 
Using mediation analysis, annoyance to noise did not explain the noise effect on 
hypertension.  
We used hypertension as the primary health outcome and also investigated the 
association with other cardiovascular outcomes including time of diagnosis. The cross-
sectional HYENA study[7] reported an OR of 1.14 per 10dB increase in Lnight, lower 
than that  observed here in this follow-up of a subset of the cohort. The reason for this 
discrepancy may lie in the study design (the older cross-sectional design was more 
prone to biases) and also in the fact that the population of our cohort is now older and 
subjects have lived for much longer in the vicinity of the airport. There is evidence that 
length of stay is associated with the occurrence of hypertension and heart disease[26, 
27], a fact that may reflect either the lag needed or the necessary cumulative exposure 
to influence the outcome[28].  
 
The majority of studies on the health effects of noise exposure concern hypertension 
with few studies on aircraft noise. However, most studies find results broadly consistent 
to ours. De Souza et al[29],  in an occupational noise exposure study at higher noise 
exposure levels (>75dB) and including younger subjects compared to the present study,

found an OR for hypertension of 1.56 (95% C.I.: 1.13-2.17). A recent meta-analysis of 
5 studies on the effect of noise on the prevalence/incidence of hypertension[6], which 
did not include the HYENA study, found an OR of 1.63 for exposure to aircraft noise 
vs non-exposure, a finding consistent with ours (although it should be noted that the 
definition of “exposure” was differently defined between studies). The meta-analysis 
by Van Kempen & Babisch[5], which included cross-sectional studies, found an OR 
between road traffic noise and hypertension equal to 1.034 (95% C.I.: 1.011-1.056) per 
5dB increase of the LAeq16hr. Meline et al[30], in a cross sectional study, investigated 
the associations of outdoor road, rail and air traffic noise, estimated at the place of 
residence and workplace with BP measurements and the assessment of hypertension. 
However, only noise estimated at the workplace was associated with elevated BP. 
 
There are a few studies in the literature which have examined the association between 
long-term aircraft noise exposure and mortality or hospitalizations for cardiovascular 
diseases providing some evidence for adverse effects of noise exposure. In the original 
HYENA study[27] an association was found between Lnight aircraft noise and 
combined heart disease and stroke for participants who had lived in the same place for 
≥ 20 years (OR=1.25 with 95% C.I.: 1.03-1.51) per 10dB. In the Heathrow study[12], 
hospital admissions showed linear trends of increasing risk with higher levels of day 
and night aircraft noise. Huss et al[26] reported a 30% increase mortality by from MIs 
in individuals exposed to >60dB compared to those exposed to <45dB aircraft noise in 
Switzerland and found the length of stay to be an important determinant of risk. Evrard 
et al[14], in an ecological study in 161 French communes near three major airports, 
found increased mortality by 18% from CVD, 24% from CHD, 28% for MI and 8% for 
stroke per 10dB increase in Lden aircraft noise.  
 
Vienneau et al[31], in a meta-analysis of 10 studies, examined the association of the 
combined exposure to road and aircraft noise on the incidence of ischemic heart disease 
and found an increased risk by 6% per 10dB increase in noise exposure starting at a 
level of 50dB. Halonen et al[32] found an 5% and 9% increased risk for hospital 
admissions in adults and elderly individuals living in areas with >60dB daytime road 
traffic noise exposure versus areas with <55dB. Kälsch et al[33] evaluated the effect of 
road traffic noise exposure on the thoracic aortic calcification and found a 3.9% increase 
per 5dB in Lnight, showing possible early effects of noise exposure on atherosclerosis.

Schmidt et al[16] in an experimental study were able to identify small changes in 
pathophysiological mechanisms in 75 healthy volunteers with small cardiovascular 
risk. Also, in another experimental study[17] they found that nighttime aircraft noise 
markedly impaired the endothelial function in 60 patients with or at risk for 
cardiovascular disease. 
 
Our study was able to analyze the association of long-term exposure to noise from 
aircrafts with the prevalence and incidence of self reported doctor diagnosed cardiac 
arrhythmia, MI, stroke and diabetes and we found an increased risk for arrhythmia and 
stroke but no association with MI and diabetes. We are not aware of other studies that 
have assessed arrhythmia. Our results for stroke are broadly consistent with the few 
other reported results but for MI they are not consistent with previously reported 
findings[31]. Reasons for this discrepancy might be the small number of cases in our 
study and the different exposure levels and sources of noise.  
 
Following the HYENA study, we assessed noise annoyance in our follow up study. 
Annoyance to noise has been identified as an independent predictor of hypertension in 
a few studies[34, 35]. However the evidence from the cross-sectional HYENA study 
showed that noise exposure is a more important risk factor for hypertension compared 
to annoyance[8]. Investigation of the role of annoyance as an effect modifier of the 
noise exposure-hypertension association gave inconsistent results[36-38]. In our 
analysis of incident cases of hypertension we found consistent results with the previous 
HYENA cross-sectional analysis, i.e. we found noise exposure to be a more important 
predictor of the risk for incident hypertension compared to annoyance and we found no 
significant effect modification. In the mediation analysis applied, our finding suggests 
that there was a noise-hypertension effect independent of annoyance, and the estimated 
indirect effect was not statistically significant.  
 
In the present study we also found an effect of long-term exposure to aircraft noise and 
hearing problems. However, according to the literature these noise levels are relatively 
low and likely not associated with such effects[22]. One possible explanation may be 
that persons with hearing problems are less annoyed and have a smaller probability of 
moving away from a noisy area.

Among the advantages of our study is the longitudinal study design. Few studies 
assessing noise exposure effects from aircraft have been cohort studies to date. Another 
advantage is the high response rate (78%). The response rate was dependent on the 
noise exposure (72% in the low exposed subjects compared with 82% in the highly 
exposed subjects). However, the high response rate in subjects of both exposure 
categories, means that this difference likely did not affect the estimates. Additionally, 
an advantage is that we were able to study effects from aircraft noise exposure in an 
area with very low road traffic noise. Also, we were able to look at potential effect 
modification resulting from noise annoyance. 
 
An important limitation was our inability to study cause-specific mortality in relation 
to noise exposure. Although 78 subjects died during the follow up, we were not able to 
examine death certificates as we had no consent for that. A further disadvantage of our 
study was the relatively small number of subjects which reduced the statistical power. 
The high prevalence of hypertension (63%) ensures enough power to detect an effect, 
however, other CVD health outcomes had a much smaller prevalence (16%, 8%, 3%, 
17% for arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, stroke and diabetes respectively). In our 
study we did not adjust for air pollution levels as the area has no monitors allowing the 
assessment of geographical variations. However, there is evidence that adjusting for air 
pollutants does not attenuate the noise effects[14, 31]. We relied on ambient noise 
models, and there may be differential attenuation of noise penetrating indoors due to 
building characteristics and window-opening. 
 
In conclusion our cohort study suggests that long-term exposure to aircraft noise, 
particularly night-time, is associated with incident hypertension and possibly CVD 
effects.

Noise exposure assessment 
 
Noise levels for separate periods of the day were modeled for the subjects’ residential addresses 
for the year 2002. For road traffic noise exposure, the Standaard Reken- en Meetvoorschrift 
(SRM) (RMW 2002) was used. In our study area road traffic is limited to three main roads and 
road traffic data were not available. Therefore vehicle counts were measured during different 
times of the day and different seasons of the year by vehicle type under the responsibility of the 
HYENA researchers and this information was used as input for the model.
