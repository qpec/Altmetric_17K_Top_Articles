Objectives. To investigate the effects of state minimum wage laws on low birth
weight and infant mortality in the United States.
Methods.Weestimatedtheeffectsofstate-levelminimumwagelawsusingadifference-
in-differences approach on rates of low birth weight (< 2500 g) and postneonatal mortality
(28–364 days) by state and month from 1980 through 2011. All models included state and
year fixed effects as well as state-specific covariates.
Results. Across all models, a dollar increase in the minimum wage above the federal
level was associated with a 1% to 2% decrease in low birth weight births and a 4%
decrease in postneonatal mortality.
Conclusions. If all states in 2014 had increased their minimum wages by 1 dollar,
there would likely have been 2790 fewer low birth weight births and 518 fewer
postneonatal deaths for the year. (Am J Public Health. 2016;106:1514–1516. doi:

revious research has consistently linked
low income with increased risk of pre-
mature mortality throughout the life span.1,2
As a stark example, the US excess infant
mortality rate (defined in comparison with
4 peer countries) during the postneonatal
period (28–364 days) is driven almost entirely
by excess infant deaths among mothers of
lower socioeconomic status.3 Low birth
weight is also a sensitive consequence of low
income, has been established as one of the
most important predictors of infant mortality,
and increases the risk of deleterious health and
economic effects into adulthood.4 Alarm-
ingly, more than 1 in 4 women giving birth in
the United States are below poverty level.5
Minimum wage standards are an important
potential contributor to family economic
security and, therefore, may influence ma-
ternal and infant health outcomes. Women,
those with low educational attainment,
young workers, and those in the service in-
dustry are more likely to be paid the federal
minimum wage or less.6 At present, mini-
mum wage laws are prominent on the public
agenda, being debated at city, state, and
federal levels as a strategy to reduce growing
income inequality and poverty. Economists
have described the minimum wage as one of
the most studied topics and have long ex-
amined potential deleterious market effects
related to legislated increases in minimum
wage. A recent review found no significant
employment loss from modest increases in
minimum wage,7 although scientific debate
continues. It is important to note that the
current federal minimum wage ($15 080
annual income) is not sufficient to lift a full-
time worker with 1 or 2 children above the
poverty threshold ($15 930 and $20 090,
respectively).
Despite the established link between low
income and ill health, few studies have ex-
amined how minimum wage policies affect
health outcomes.8,9 We have taken advantage
of natural experiments in minimum wage
laws across states and time over the past 30 or
more years to empirically evaluate the hy-
pothesis that increases in state-level minimum
wages are associated with reduced rates of low
birth weight infants and infant mortality.10
METHODS
The main independent variable is the
state-level minimum wage for each of the
50 states by month from 1980 through
2011 on the basis of the effective date (not
passage date) of legislative bills passed by
legislatures and signed into law by state
governors and then codified into statutory
records. In cases in which 1 law includes
multiple changes in minimum wage (e.g.,
a phase-in period), we coded each change
separately. We completed data collection and
coding with extensive quality control pro-
cedures, including blinded independent
coding of a random sample of items by 2
trained legal researchers, who demonstrated
a first-pass agreement score of 86%. A
senior attorney closely supervised all legal
coders and reviewed protocols with coders for
any variable showing a 5% or higher cross-
coder disagreement rate. The supervising
attorney resolved all divergences between
2 coders after meeting with the 2 coders
and examining the original legal text.10 We
integrated the resulting data set after legal
research coding into SAS version 9.3 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC) data files for analysis.

 mortality and natality data (i.e., no sampling).
They are consistently and comprehensively
measured each month, making them ideal
for a time-series study lasting several decades.
On the basis of these files, we created
frequencies and rates of low birth weight
(< 2500 g at birth) and postneonatal mortality
(28–364 days) by state and month from 1980
through 2011. Postneonatal mortality is
largely the result of the conditions in which
infants live by contrast to neonatal mortality,
which is often the result of a complex mix
of genetic and health care delivery factors.3
State Minimum Wage
and Covariates
To assess effects of state-level minimum
wages on infant outcomes, we calculated the
difference between state-level minimum
wage and the federal minimum wage in each
state and month from 1980 to 2011. We
adjusted all calculations for inflation by
expressing all differences in 2011 dollars.
State-level covariates included percentage
African American and mean age of mothers
from natality files, poverty rate from census
data, and cigarette sales from Orzechowski
and Walker.11
Statistical Analysis
We estimated the effects of state-level
minimum wage using a quasiexperimental
difference-in-differences research design. In
addition to our state-level minimum wage
variable, we included a full set of year and
state fixed effects. The year fixed effects ac-
count for any changes over time in infant
outcomes common across states, whereas the
state fixed effects control for any time-
invariant differences between states. Thus,
this research design efficiently controls for
a host of other factors affecting the outcomes,
both measured and unmeasured. Remaining
covariates that are a potential threat to validity
are only those that change close in time to
a state wage policy change and only in that
particular state.
Almost all the common covariates change
quite slowly over time, and trends in these
factors are rarely limited to 1 state but reflect
broader regional or national trends. For these
reasons, even if they are important causal
factors driving the outcomes, they are ade-
quately controlled for by counterfactuals in
the research design (i.e., other states not
changing minimum wage at the same time).
However, to be conservative, we included
the following covariates in the models in
addition to year- and state-level fixed effects:
poverty rate, cigarette sales, percentage Af-
rican American mothers, and mean age of
mother. We conducted additional analyses
lagging the state minimum wage and cova-
riates by 12 months to account for potential
delays in the effect of state minimum wage
policy on pregnancy-related outcomes.
We conducted all analyses using general-
ized estimating equations using PROC
GENMOD in SAS. We weighted observa-
tions by the number of live births in each
state and month in all analyses to accurately
reflect the underlying individual-level data.
To account for within-state autocorrelation,
we used state-clustered SEs when calculating
all tests and confidence intervals. We calcu-
lated percentage changes using model esti-
mates and the mean infant outcome in
state-months that had a minimum wage at
the federal level.
RESULTS
There were 206 legal changes in state
minimum wage (independent of federal
changes), with the value averaging $7.01
(SD = 0.72) and ranging from $5.58 to $10.44
(in 2011 dollars). For state-months in which
the state minimum wage differed from the
federal standard, the difference averaged
$1.03 (SD = 0.68) and ranged from $0.03 to
$3.10 (in 2011 dollars).
Our results show a consistent pattern of
health improvement associated with a state
minimum wage above the federal minimum
(Table 1). All models show statistically sig-
nificant effects, with the sole exception of
1 adjusted lagged model, in which P = .06.
Across all models, a dollar increase in the
minimum wage above the federal level is
associated with a 1% to 2% decrease in low
birth weight births and a 4% decrease in
postneonatal mortality.
DISCUSSION
Our results provide empirical evidence
that increased state minimum wages are as-
sociated with reduced low birth weight births
and reduced postneonatal infant deaths. On
the basis of the findings, if all states in 2014 had
increased their minimum wages by 1 dollar
there would likely have been an estimated
2790 fewer low birth weight births and 518
fewer postneonatal deaths for the year.
The analyses were at the state level;
therefore, we were unable to control for
potential individual-level covariates or
assess multilevel mediators of the effects
of minimum wage laws on birth out-
comes. However, we designed a strong

 quasiexperiment,10 analyzing 206 legal
changes in minimum wage across 30 years
and 50 states, analyzed higher time-resolution
monthly (rather than annual) observations,
included state and year fixed effects to effi-
ciently control for a host of potential con-
founders, and replicated the results across
2 distinct infant health indicators.
Our results add to a growing scientific
literature on the beneficial effects of vari-
ous income supports on improved birth
outcomes.12,13
PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS
The implications of these findings for
policymakers, advocates, and public health
practitioners are noteworthy. The annual
social and health cost of preterm or low birth
weight births in the United States was at
least $26.2 billion in 2005.14 The pain and
suffering from the deaths of so many infants in
their first year of life are incalculable. That past
modest changes to state minimum wage
laws appear to have had such important effects
bodes well for possible beneficial effects of
a range of minimum wage increases currently
under active public discussion and policy-
maker consideration.
Public health professionals have long
studied and long lamented the severe dele-
terious health effects of poverty. It is now time
to move directly into developing, testing,
and evaluating the health effects of specific
public policies affecting poverty. There are
a host of public policies that shape the so-
cioeconomic environment of children and
adults. Our study is a small start that we hope
will spur many other epidemiologists and
related scientists to study specific ways
to ameliorate poverty and its deleterious
health effects.
