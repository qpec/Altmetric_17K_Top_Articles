IMPORTANCE Neonates born to overweight or obese women are larger and at higher risk of
birth complications. Many maternal obesity-related traits are observationally associated with
birth weight, but the causal nature of these associations is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE To test for genetic evidence of causal associations of maternal body mass index
(BMI) and related traits with birth weight.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Mendelian randomization to test whether maternal BMI
and obesity-related traits are potentially causally related to offspring birth weight. Data from
30 487 women in 18 studies were analyzed. Participants were of European ancestry from
population- or community-based studies in Europe, North America, or Australia and were part
of the Early Growth Genetics Consortium. Live, term, singleton offspring born between 1929
and 2013 were included.
EXPOSURES Genetic scores for BMI, fasting glucose level, type 2 diabetes, systolic blood
pressure (SBP), triglyceride level, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level, vitamin
D status, and adiponectin level.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE Offspring birth weight from 18 studies.
RESULTS Among the 30 487 newborns the mean birth weight in the various cohorts ranged
from 3325 g to 3679 g. The maternal genetic score for BMI was associated with a 2-g (95% CI,
0 to 3 g) higher offspring birth weight per maternal BMI-raising allele (P = .008). The
maternal genetic scores for fasting glucose and SBP were also associated with birth weight
with effect sizes of 8 g (95% CI, 6 to 10 g) per glucose-raising allele (P = 7 × 10−14) and −4 g
(95% CI, −6 to −2g) per SBP-raising allele (P = 1×10−5), respectively. A 1-SD ( ≈ 4 points)
genetically higher maternal BMI was associated with a 55-g higher offspring birth weight
(95% CI, 17 to 93 g). A 1-SD ( ≈ 7.2 mg/dL) genetically higher maternal fasting glucose
concentration was associated with 114-g higher offspring birth weight (95% CI, 80 to 147 g).
However, a 1-SD ( ≈ 10 mm Hg) genetically higher maternal SBP was associated with a 208-g
lower offspring birth weight (95% CI, −394 to −21 g). For BMI and fasting glucose, genetic
associations were consistent with the observational associations, but for systolic blood
pressure, the genetic and observational associations were in opposite directions.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this mendelian randomization study, genetically elevated
maternal BMI and blood glucose levels were potentially causally associated with higher
offspring birth weight, whereas genetically elevated maternal SBP was potentially causally
related to lower birth weight. If replicated, these findings may have implications for
counseling and managing pregnancies to avoid adverse weight-related birth outcomes.

N
eonates born to overweight or obese women are more
likely to be large for gestational age.1 The precise
mechanisms underlying this association and the ex-
tent to which confounding factors contribute are poorly un-
derstood. It is important to understand which maternal traits
are causally associated with birth weight because this may fa-
cilitate targeted development of interventions to be tested in
randomizedclinicaltrialsandenableclear,evidence-basedrec-
ommendations for pregnant women.
Maternal overweight and obesity are key risk factors for
gestationaldiabetes.2Evenintheabsenceofdiabetesandwhen
following the same controlled diet, obese women have higher
glucose levels than normal-weight women.3 The association
between gestational diabetes and higher birth weight is well
documented.4 Maternal glucose levels below those diagnos-
ticofdiabetesalsoshowstrongassociationswithbirthweight.5
The fetus of an overweight or obese woman may be
exposed to the consequences of higher maternal triglyceride
levels and blood pressure, lower levels of high-density lipo-
protein cholesterol (HDL-C) and adiponectin, and lower vita-
min D status (Box 1).1,6,7 However, associations are not always
consistently observed and may be confounded by maternal
socioeconomic status and associated behaviors such as
smoking and diet. Furthermore, the high intercorrelation of
obesity-related traits complicates determination of causal
relationships in an observational setting.
Maternal genotypes may be used in a mendelian
randomization13,14 approach to provide evidence of a poten-
tial causal association between maternal traits and birth out-
comes (Figure 1). Mendelian randomization is analogous to a
randomized clinical trial: genotypes, which are randomly al-
located at conception, are largely free from confounding and
can be used to estimate the possible causal effects of mater-
nal traits. In this study, genetic variants were selected to cal-
culate genetic scores representing maternal body mass index
(BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in
meters squared) and each of 7 obesity-related maternal traits.
The potential causal relationship between maternal BMI and
each related trait was estimated by testing associations be-
tween maternal genetic risk scores and offspring birth weights.
Methods
Study Participants
Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data were
used from 30 487 women participating in 18 population- or
community-based studies in Europe, North America, or
Australia. The birth weight of 1 child per mother was
included (see eTable 1 for full details of participant charac-
teristics and eTable 2 for genotyping information, both in
the Supplement). Birth weight was measured by trained
study personnel (n = 2 studies), from medical records
(n = 10 studies), or from maternal report (n = 6 studies). The
offspring years of birth were from 1929 to 2013. Multiple
births, stillbirths, congenital anomalies, births before 37
weeks’gestation, and individuals of non-European ancestry
were excluded. Informed consent was obtained from all par-
ticipants, and study protocols were approved by the local,
regional, or institutional ethics committees.
Selection of Maternal Obesity-Related Traits and SNPs
In addition to BMI, traits were selected that are associated with
maternal obesity and may affect fetal growth through the in-
trauterine environment. Their effects were modeled in the di-
rections hypothesized by their relationships to maternal BMI
(Box 1).
Single-nucleotidepolymorphismsknowntoberobustlyas-
sociated (P < 5 × 10−8) with BMI and each obesity-related trait
were selected. Full details of the selected SNPs are provided
in eTable 3 in the Supplement. Single-nucleotide polymor-
phismsassociatedwithfastingglucoseandtype2diabeteswere
used to represent maternal glycemia. The type 2 diabetes SNPs
were considered to represent exposure to maternal diabetes
in pregnancy, including gestational diabetes, given overlap be-
tween type 2 and gestational diabetes’genetic susceptibility
variants.15 For blood pressure, SNPs were selected that are pri-
marily associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP), al-
though all also show strong evidence of association with dia-
stolic blood pressure. For vitamin D status, 2 SNPs with
hypothesized roles in vitamin D synthesis were used to rep-
resent 25(OH)D levels (an indicator of overall vitamin D sta-
tus), as previously recommended.16,17 Further details of SNP
selection are provided in the eMethods in the Supplement.
A weighted genetic score was calculated for each mater-
nal trait (see eMethods in the Supplement for full details). Very
few of the selected SNPs have been tested in pregnancy. Ge-
netic scores were validated by confirming that each was asso-
ciatedwithitsrespectivematernaltrait,measuredduringpreg-
nancy (with the exception of BMI, for which the prepregnancy
value was used). Maternal prepregnancy BMI was available
from registry data (n = 2 studies) or calculated from self-
reported weight and height (n = 3 studies). In the Avon Lon-
gitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) study, the
self-report was validated with a clinic measure.18 Details of

traits measured in pregnancy and their sources are given in
eTable 4 in the Supplement. In each available study, linear re-
gressionofthematernaltrait(eg,BMI)againstthegeneticscore
was performed, adjusting for maternal age. To confirm that as-
sociations between each genetic score and its respective ma-
ternal trait were similar in the same individuals during and af-
ter pregnancy, available data were used from 2 longitudinal
studies (ALSPAC and the Exeter Family Study of Childhood
Health [EFSOCH]). To check that the strategy for SNP selec-
tion had resulted in genetic scores that were specific to each
maternal trait, the association was tested between each of the
8 genetic scores and each maternal trait in addition to indica-
tors of maternal socioeconomic status and smoking.
Analyses of Maternal Obesity-Related Traits
and Birth Weight
For BMI and each related maternal trait, 2 mendelian random-
ization approaches were used to test the hypothesis that the
trait was causally related to birth weight. First, associations
weretestedbetweengeneticscoresrepresentingmaternaltraits
and offspring birth weight using the maximum number of par-
ticipants (ie, for each trait, those with genetic score and off-
spring birth weight data available, irrespective of whether they
had the maternal trait measured). An association of the ge-
netic score with birth weight would support a possible causal
relationshipbetweenthetrait(eg,prepregnancyBMI)andbirth
weight but would not provide information on the size of that
association. Second, we performed analyses in those with the
measured trait that enabled an estimate of the size of a pos-
sible causal relationship. The analyses took into account the
association between each genetic score and the maternal trait
it represented (eg, BMI), in addition to the association be-
tween the same genetic score and birth weight. These 2 re-
sults were used to calculate an association between the ma-
ternal trait (eg, BMI) and birth weight that was free from
confounding. This second approach measures the relation-
ship between variation in maternal BMI (or BMI-related trait)
and birth weight that is attributable only to genetic factors (see
Figure 1 for an explanation of the method). For each ap-
proach, meta-analysis was used to combine data from indi-
vidual studies (see eMethods in the Supplement).
Usingthefirstapproach,weinvestigatedtheassociationbe-
tween each genetic score and (1) birth weight and (2) ponderal
index(anindexofneonatalleanness,calculatedasbirthweight
in kilograms divided by birth length in meters cubed). Within
each study, birth weight or ponderal index Z scores were re-
gressed against each maternal genetic score, adjusted for off-
spring sex and gestational age. Analyses using the type 2 dia-
betes genetic score were repeated after excluding participants
with preexisting and gestational diabetes. Analyses using the
SBP genetic score were repeated after excluding participants
with preeclampsia and existing or gestational hypertension.
The genetic estimate of the association between each ma-
ternal trait and birth weight or ponderal index from the sec-
ond approach was compared with the corresponding obser-
vational association. To obtain the observational estimates,
linear regression was performed using birth weight or pon-
deral index as the dependent variable, and each of 7 maternal
traits as independent variables, adjusting for sex and gesta-
tionalage.Therewasinsufficientinformationonmaternaltype
2 diabetes prevalence, so it was not possible to estimate the
causal relationship for that trait. Full details of the analysis are
provided in the eMethods (in the Supplement).
Maternal BMI, Birth Weight, and Fasting Glucose
To estimate how much of the association between maternal
BMI and birth weight might be mediated by fasting glucose,
available data were used first to estimate the approximate
causal relationship between a 1-SD higher maternal BMI
(≈4 points) and (1) fasting glucose and (2) SBP. Then, using each
of those estimates, the results of the mendelian randomiza-
tion analyses were rescaled to represent the effects of fasting
glucose and SBP that could be directly compared with the
causal relationship between a 1-SD higher maternal BMI and
birth weight (see eMethods in the Supplement for a detailed
description of the method).
Correcting for Direct Fetal Genotype Effects
Genotypesofmaternal-fetalpairswereavailableinupto8stud-
ies (total for analysis, 11 493). Analyses were repeated includ-
ing the fetal genotype at each SNP in the model to correct for
potentialconfoundingcausedbydirecteffectsofthefetalgeno-
type. A 2-sided P value <.05 was considered to provide evi-
dence against the null hypothesis. Statistical software used for
data analysis within each individual study is detailed in eTable
2 in the Supplement. All meta-analyses were performed using
Stata v.13 (StataCorp).

If a maternal trait causally influences offspring birth weight, then a risk score of
genetic variants associated with that trait will also be associated with birth
weight. Because genotype is determined at conception, it should not be
associated with factors that normally confound the association between
maternal traits and birth weight (eg, socioeconomic status). Estimates of the
genetic score–maternal phenotype association (w) and the genetic score-birth
weight association (x) may be used to estimate the association between the
maternal trait variation that is due to genetic score and birth weight (y = x/w),
which is expected to be free from confounding. If the estimated causal
relationship, y, is different from the observational association between the
measured maternal phenotype and birth weight, this would suggest that the
observational association is confounded (assuming that the assumptions of the
mendelian randomization analyses are valid).14 The dashed line connecting
maternal trait with fetal growth indicates that the causal nature of the
association is uncertain. It is important to adjust for possible direct effects of
fetal genotype (z). Body mass index is calculated as weight in kilograms divided
by height in meters squared; ponderal index of neonatal leanness, calculated as
birth weight in kilograms divided by birth length in meters cubed.

Results
The characteristics of included participants from the 18 con-
tributing studies are shown in Table 1. Among the 30 487 new-
borns the mean birth weight ranged from 3325 g to 3679 g. The
mean prepregnancy BMI was available in 11 studies and ranged
from 22.78 to 24.83. The mean maternal age at delivery, avail-
able in 16 studies, ranged from 24.5 years to 31.5 years.
There was evidence of an association between each ge-
netic score and its corresponding maternal trait measured in
pregnancy (P ≤ .003; Table 2). For BMI, fasting glucose, and
SBP,datafrommultiplestudiesweremeta-analyzed,withsimi-
lar effect estimates among studies for BMI and fasting glu-
cose (P for heterogeneity >.05) and evidence of heteroge-
neity for SBP (P for heterogeneity = .04). The effect sizes of
associations between maternal traits and their respective ge-
netic scores were very similar when compared in the same in-

dividuals during and outside pregnancy, with the exception
oftheSBPgeneticscore,whichhadaweakereffectduringpreg-
nancy (eTable 5 in the Supplement). There was no evidence
of association between any genetic score and potentially con-
founding variables. No individual genetic score was associ-
ated with any of the other maternal traits, except for the ge-
netic score for BMI, which was positively associated with SBP
(P < .003 Bonferroni-corrected for 15 tests; eTable 6 in the
Supplement).
Higher Maternal BMI and Higher Birth Weight
The maternal BMI genetic score was associated with higher
birth weight (Table 3) and ponderal index (eTable 7 in the
Supplement) with similar effect sizes before and after adjust-
ingforpossibleeffectsoffetalgenotype.Usingthegeneticscore
to quantify the possible causal association, a 1-SD genetically
higher maternal BMI was associated with a 55-g higher off-
spring birth weight (95% CI, 17-93 g). After adjusting for fetal
genotype, the estimated effect was 104-g increase (95% CI,
32-176 g) (Table 4). These mendelian randomization causal es-
timates were similar to the observational association of 62 g
per SD of higher maternal BMI (95% CI, 56-70 g) (Figure 2).
Similar results were obtained for ponderal index (eTable 8 and
eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
Higher Maternal Fasting Glucose, Higher Birth Weight
The maternal fasting glucose and type 2 diabetes genetic
scores were associated with higher birth weight (Table 3) and
ponderal index (eTable 7 in the Supplement) with similar
effect size estimates before and after adjusting for fetal geno-
type and before and after excluding preexisting and gesta-
tional diabetes. Using the genetic score to estimate the pos-
sible causal relationship, a 1-SD (7.2 mg/dL) of genetically
higher maternal glucose was associated with a 114-g higher
birth weight (95% CI, 80-147 g). After adjusting for fetal geno-
type, the association was 145 g (95% CI, 91-199 g) (Table 4).
These genetic estimates were similar to the observational
association of 92 g (95% CI, 80-104) per each SD higher
maternal glucose (7.2 mg/dL) (Figure 2). Similar results were
obtained for ponderal index (eTable 8 and eFigure 1 in the
Supplement).(To convert glucose from mg/dL to mmol/L,
multiply by 0.0555.)

Maternal Lipids, Adiponectin, and Birth Weight
The maternal triglyceride genetic score was not associated
with offspring birth weight (Table 3) or ponderal index
(eTable 7 in the Supplement). Using the genetic score to esti-
mate the possible causal relationship, a genetically higher
maternal triglyceride level was not associated with offspring
birth weight and the 95% CIs around the genetic estimate
excluded the observational association between maternal
triglycerides and birth weight (P = .007 testing difference
between genetic and observational association; Table 4;
Figure 2). Likewise, the genetic estimate of the possible
effect of maternal adiponectin levels on offspring birth
weight was different from the observational association
(P = .002). The genetic score for HDL-C was not associated
with birth weight or ponderal index. The analysis was con-
sistent with no causal relationship; however, this could not
be distinguished from the negative observational association
between maternal HDL-C and birth weight.
Higher SBP and Lower Birth Weight
ThematernalSBPgeneticscorewasassociatedwithlowerbirth
weight (Table 3) and ponderal index (eTable 7 in the Supple-
ment) with similar effect-size estimates before and after ad-
justing for fetal genotype and before and after excluding ma-
ternal preeclampsia and hypertension. Using the genetic score
to estimate the possible causal relationship, a 1-SD (10 mm Hg)
genetically higher maternal SBP was associated with a −208-g
lower offspring birth weight (95% CI, −394 to −21 g). After ad-
justing for fetal genotype, the estimated effect was −151 g (95%
CI, −390 to 89 g) (Table 4). The genetic estimate of the asso-
ciation between maternal SBP and birth weight in the full
sample of women was in the opposite direction to the obser-
vationalassociation(P = .01fordifferencebetweengeneticand
observational associations; Table 4; Figure 2). Similar results
were obtained for ponderal index (eTable 8 and eFigure 1 in
the Supplement).
The maternal genetic score for lower vitamin D status was
associated with lower birth weight (P = .03; Table 3). How-
ever, the estimated causal relationship was not significantly
differentfrom0(theestimatedchangeinbirthweightfora10%
genetically lower maternal 25[OH]D level was −26 g (95% CI,
−54 to 2 g); Table 4, Figure 2).
Consistency Among Studies in the Meta-analysis
Associations between maternal genetic scores and offspring
birth weight were similar between studies in the meta-
analysis (Table 3; P for heterogeneity>.05). When data were
combined from observational analyses, the associations be-
tween maternal fasting glucose or SBP and birth weight were
similar (P for heterogeneity>.05), and there was evidence of
heterogeneity for the BMI-birth weight observational associa-
tion (Table 4; P for heterogeneity = .03).
Maternal BMI, Maternal Fasting Glucose,
and Offspring Birth Weight
To estimate how much of the association between maternal
BMI and birth weight might be mediated by fasting glucose,
the BMI and fasting glucose genetic scores were used. A 1-SD

genetically higher maternal BMI was associated with a 0.34 SD
( ≈ 2.5 mg/dL) higher maternal fasting glucose. From the men-
delian randomization analyses, a 1-SD genetically higher ma-
ternal fasting glucose was associated with a 114-g higher birth
weight (95% CI, 80-147 g). Consequently, it was predicted that
a 0.34-SD higher fasting glucose would be associated with a
114 g × 0.34 = 39 g; (95% CI, 27-50 g) higher birth weight. This
approximation is broadly similar to the total estimated effect
ofanSDhigherBMIonbirthweight(55g;95%CI,17-93g).How-
ever, using the same method with the BMI and SBP genetic
scores, we estimated that a an SD higher maternal BMI would
beassociatedwitha−40g(95%CI,−75to−4)lowerbirthweight
via its association with maternal SBP (eFigure 2 in the Supple-
ment), which would oppose the positive association with ma-
ternal fasting glucose.
Discussion
This study provides evidence for a possible causal associa-
tion between maternal BMI and offspring birth weight. A
genetically higher maternal BMI of 4 points was associated
with a 55 g (95% CI, 17-93 g) higher offspring birth weight. In
addition, a genetically higher circulating maternal fasting
glucose of 7.2 mg/dL was associated with a 114 g (95% CI,
80-147 g) higher birth weight, whereas genetically higher
maternal SBP of 10 mm Hg was associated with a −208 g
(95% CI, −394 to −21 g) lower birth weight. These results pro-
vide evidence that genetically elevated maternal glucose and
SBP may have directionally opposite causal associations with
birth weight. The estimated associations between these
maternal traits and birth weight (either increased or reduced)
are substantial and of clinical importance. They support
efforts to maintain healthy gestational glucose and blood
pressure levels to ensure healthy fetal growth. The positive
association between maternal BMI and birth weight may be
partially mediated by the effect of higher BMI on circulating
maternal fasting glucose. There was no evidence of associa-
tion of offspring brith weight with a genetic score for mater-
nal triglycerides, which have also been hypothesized to be
important contributors to higher birth weight in overweight
or obese women. Other lipids, or specific subclasses of tri-
glycerides, might be important but require further study.
These results provide genetic evidence of a potentially
causalassociationbetweenmaternalglycemiaandbirthweight
and ponderal index, even in women with no preexisting or ges-
tational diabetes, which is consistent with published obser-
vational data.5 A possible explanation for this finding is that
womenwithahighergeneticscorefortype2diabeteshaverela-
tively higher glucose levels in pregnancy, as a result of inad-
equate beta-cell compensation in response to gestational in-
sulin resistance,19,20 leading to increased placental glucose
transfer and fetal insulin secretion,21 and consequently higher
birth weight.

These data did not support a causal association between
maternal triglyceride, HDL-C or adiponectin levels and birth
weight or ponderal index. The genetic associations between
maternal triglycerides and adiponectin and birth weight were
null, in contrast to the observational associations, suggesting
that the observational associations seen herein, and in other
published studies,8,9,12 are confounded.
The mendelian randomization analysis showed that the
positive observational association between SBP and birth
weight is confounded, most likely by BMI, which is both an im-
portant risk factor for higher SBP in pregnancy and positively
associated with birth weight.1 Using genetic variants that are
independent of confounding by BMI, genetically higher ma-
ternal SBP was associated with lower birth weight, even after
excludingpreeclampsiaandhypertension.Theprecisionofour
estimate of the change in birth weight per 1 SD in maternal SBP
could be affected by the heterogeneity between studies in the
genetic score-SBP association (P = .04, I2 = 76.0%; Table 2).
However, associations between the SBP genetic score and birth
weight were consistent across all 13 meta-analyzed studies
(P = .14; I2 = 30.4%; Table 3) and supportive of a causal asso-
ciation between higher maternal SBP and lower birth weight.
Thesefindingssupportobservationalassociationsbetweenma-

pathology.23 There are increasing concerns about the effect the
obesity epidemic might have on birth size, via greater mater-
nal BMI. However, the focus of that concern has been largely

a For 25[OH]D and adiponectin, we present the change in birth weight for a
10% change in maternal trait level because these variables were logged for
analysis. The genetic change was estimated from mendelian randomization
analysis, in which a genetic score was used to estimate the possible causal
relationship between the maternal trait and birth weight. The genetic estimate
is presented twice: in the second case it was adjusted for fetal genotype using
a subset of available studies. The error bars represent the 95% CIs around
the effect size estimates. For maternal prepregnancy body mass index
(BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared)
and fasting glucose, the 95% CIs for both the observational and genetic
approaches exclude the null, suggesting positive possible causal relationships
between maternal BMI and fasting glucose and birth weight. For maternal
systolic blood pressure, the observational analysis suggested a weak positive
association with birth weight, whereas the genetic analysis showed evidence
of a negative possible causal relationship. Observational analyses suggested
that higher maternal triglyceride levels, lower maternal adiponectin and lower
maternal high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were associated
with higher birth weight, whereas lower maternal vitamin D status was
associated with lower birth weight, but none of these was supported by the
genetic analyses. To convert glucose from mg/dL to mmol/L, multiply by
0.0555; HDL-C from mg/dL to mmol/L, 0.0259; triglycerides from mg/dL to

on increased birth size as a result of greater maternal glucose
and other fetal nutrients. Our findings suggest that there may
be opposing effects of maternal blood pressure and glucose.
Published mendelian randomization analyses provide evi-
dence that higher BMI is causally associated with lower vita-
min D status,6 and evidence from multiple observational stud-
ies suggests that lower maternal vitamin D is associated with
lower birth weight.11,24 Our analysis of the vitamin D genetic
score provided some evidence to support a possible causal as-
sociation with birth weight, but this requires further explora-
tion in larger numbers of pregnancies.
Socioeconomicfactorsandrelatedbehaviorssuchassmok-
ing are key confounders of observational associations be-
tween maternal BMI (or BMI-related traits) and offspring birth
weight,sincetheyareassociatedwithbothvariables(seeeTable
9 in Supplement for a demonstration of these associations in
the ALSPAC study). The genetic scores used in our analyses
were not associated with socio-economic factors or smoking,
and this illustrates a key strength of the mendelian random-
ization approach: since genotypes are determined at concep-
tion, such confounding is avoided.
There are some limitations to this study. Despite at-
tempts to maximize specificity of the genetic scores, we can-
not fully exclude the possibility that the selected genetic vari-
ants act on more than one maternal trait. Although all available
information was used, there was limited power to detect as-
sociations between the genetic scores and other traits. For ex-
ample, the known association between BMI-associated vari-
ants and triglyceride levels was not detected.25 With the
potentialforhigh-throughputmetabolomicstudiesandagrow-
ing public database of genetic associations,26-28 future stud-
ies will likely improve the specificity (for different lipid sub-
fractions) of selected genetic variants.
Despite the large sample in this study, statistical power to
detectpotentiallycausalrelationshipswaslimitedforsomema-
ternal traits (see eMethods and eTable 10 in Supplement for
powercalculations).Thetotalsampleprovidedmorethan99%
power to detect associations at P < .05 between birth weight
and genetic scores such as fasting glucose and systolic blood
pressure that explain at least 0.1% variance in birth weight.
However, larger samples (>80 000) will be needed to confi-
dently detect or rule out the association with vitamin D sta-
tussuggestedbyourdata,orsmallerpositiveornegativecausal
associations between maternal triglycerides, HDL-C or adipo-
nectin and birth weight.
Although adjusting for the fetal genetic scores was neces-
sary to separate maternal effects from the direct effects of ge-
netic variants in the fetus, this could introduce bias via asso-
ciation with paternal genotypes. Assortative mating for BMI
couldadditionallyresultinacorrelationbetweenmaternaland
paternal genotypes, leading to similar bias. However, a fa-
ther’
s genetic score would only confound the mendelian ran-
domization estimates if the father’
s phenotype were related
to birth weight, and we found only very weak associations of
fathers BMI and related traits with offspring birth weight
(eTable 11 in Supplement). Another potential bias could be in-
duced by the use of the genetic score for SBP, which was de-
rived from a genome-wide association study of blood pres-
sure conditional on BMI. Because BMI is also associated with
birth weight, this could bias the results. However, similar re-
sults were obtained using an alternative genetic score that was
unadjusted for BMI (eMethods).
Inmendelianrandomizationanalysis,aweakstatisticalas-
sociation between a genetic score and a maternal trait (due to
low variance explained or small sample size) has the poten-
tial to cause weak instrument bias toward the observational
results.29 The proportions of maternal trait variance ex-
plained by the genetic scores are modest in our study (Table 2).
However, the large overall sample size ensured that the pos-
sible causal associations identified are unlikely to be due to
weak instrument bias (see eMethods).
Our analyses assume that maternal BMI and related traits
arelinearlyassociatedwithoffspringbirthweight.Wehavenot
tested for nonlinear associations which, in a mendelian ran-
domization design, would require very large numbers.30 How-
ever, for maternal BMI, fasting glucose and SBP, there is ob-
servational evidence of such linear associations across the
distribution, with no evidence of threshold or curvilinear
associations.5,10,31
Conclusions
In this mendelian randomization study, genetically elevated
maternal BMI and blood glucose levels were potentially caus-
ally associated with higher offspring birth weight, whereas ge-
netically elevated maternal SBP was potentially causally re-
lated to lower birth weight. If replicated, these findings may
have implications for counseling and managing pregnancies
to avoid adverse weight-related birth outcomes.
