Introduction
Fructose has generated much attention as a potential driver of the US obesity and diabetes epidemics 
(1). In the brain, fructose, in contrast to glucose, appears to promote feeding behavior in rodents (2), 
and in humans, acute ingestion of fructose or glucose causes different patterns of cerebral blood flow 
changes in brain regions that influence eating behavior (3, 4). Because glucose enters the brain via 
passage across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (5, 6), it is generally assumed that the CNS effects of fruc-
tose are mediated by peripheral fructose crossing the BBB as well (7). However, because of its efficient 
metabolism by the liver, extrahepatic circulating levels of fructose are exceedingly low. Thus, the extent 
to which peripheral fructose can cross the BBB to generate its CNS effects remains uncertain.
In this study, we use magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) scanning, which allows for non-
invasive direct measurements of metabolite concentrations to test an alternate mechanism, namely 
that fructose is produced endogenously within the human brain from glucose via the polyol pathway 
(glucose → sorbitol → fructose). The polyol pathway is an accessory glucose pathway that bypasses 
glycolysis (8, 9), and in the setting of hyperglycemia, up to 30% of glucose can be metabolized via this 
alternate pathway (10, 11 ). The polyol pathway is present throughout the human body, including the 
brain (12, 13), and it is responsible for the 20-fold higher levels of fructose observed in cerebrospinal 
fluid compared with blood (14).
In addition to fructose generation, flux through the polyol pathway also generates oxidative stress 
via production of NADH as well as because aldose reductase competes with glutathione reductase for 
NADPH, resulting in decreased glutathione (15). It is noteworthy that, in the periphery, this excessive 
oxidative stress has been implicated in the development of peripheral neuropathy (16), diabetic reti-
nopathy and cataracts (17–20), nephropathy (21), fatty liver (22), and macrovascular disease (23) as 
well as platelet dysfunction (24, 25). In the brain, however, its role remains unclear. Thus, the current 
proof-of-concept study examines whether peripheral hyperglycemia can drive intracerebral production 
of fructose via the polyol pathway in lean, healthy individuals.
Fructose has been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity and type 2 diabetes. In contrast 
to glucose, CNS delivery of fructose in rodents promotes feeding behavior. However, because 
circulating plasma fructose levels are exceedingly low, it remains unclear to what extent fructose 
crosses the blood-brain barrier to exert CNS effects. To determine whether fructose can be 
endogenously generated from glucose via the polyol pathway (glucose → sorbitol → fructose) in 
human brain, 8 healthy subjects (4 women/4 men; age, 28.8 ± 6.2 years; BMI, 23.4 ± 2.6; HbA1C, 
4.9% ± 0.2%) underwent 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy scanning to measure intracerebral 
glucose and fructose levels during a 4-hour hyperglycemic clamp (plasma glucose, 220 mg/dl). 
Using mixed-effects regression model analysis, intracerebral glucose rose significantly over time 
and differed from baseline at 20 to 230 minutes. Intracerebral fructose levels also rose over time, 
differing from baseline at 30 to 230 minutes. The changes in intracerebral fructose were related 
to changes in intracerebral glucose but not to plasma fructose levels. Our findings suggest that 
the polyol pathway contributes to endogenous CNS production of fructose and that the effects of 
fructose in the CNS may extend beyond its direct dietary consumption.

Results
Baseline fasting plasma glucose was 4.87 ± 0.15 mmol/l 
and rapidly increased to approximately 12 mmol/l during 
the hyperglycemic clamp (P < 0.0001) (Figure 1A). Fast-
ing levels of plasma fructose and sorbitol were much low-
er at baseline (0.008 ± 0.001 mmol/l and 0.008 ± 0.003 
mmol/l, respectively), and plasma fructose levels rose 
slightly (peak 0.0145 mmol/l at 180 min) (Figure 1B). 
No differences in plasma sorbitol levels were detected 
throughout (Figure 1B).
Baseline spectra were subtracted from spectra 
obtained every 10 minutes during the course of the glu-
cose infusion in order to generate the difference spectra 
(Figure 2A), which were then compared with the refer-
ence spectra for glucose, fructose, and glucose and fruc-
tose obtained under identical scanning parameters (Figure 
2B). Compared with baseline, intracerebral glucose levels 
rose significantly over time, beginning at 10 minutes (P = 
0.0004) through the end of the study (P < 0.0001). More-
over, brain fructose levels also rose significantly compared 
with baseline, beginning at 20 minutes (P = 0.007) and 
extending through the end of the study (P < 0.01) (Figure 
3A). Each of the 8 subjects had increases in intracerebral 
glucose (Figure 3B) and intracerebral fructose (Figure 3C). The magnitude of the change in intracerebral 
fructose concentration (obtained from times 60–180 minutes) was about 30%–35% of the change in intrace-
rebral glucose (Figure 3A). Furthermore, the change in brain fructose levels was associated with the change 
in brain glucose levels (β coefficient = 0.18, SEM 0.03, P < 0.0001) but not plasma fructose levels (P = 0.36).
Discussion
The current data demonstrate that fructose is rapidly generated in the human brain during hyperglycemia. 
Our findings are consistent with those of a prior study in rats using 19F-MRS, which showed that, following 
i.v. 3-fluoro-3-deoxy-D-glucose infusion, there was a rise in intracerebral 3-fluoro-3-deoxy-D-sorbitol and 
3-fluoro-3-deoxy-D-fructose. Furthermore, the production of sorbitol and fructose was blocked by sorbinil, 
an inhibitor of the rate-limiting enzyme, aldose reductase (26). Together with the previous finding that fruc-
tose and sorbitol are present in human cerebrospinal fluid at markedly higher concentrations than in the 
periphery (12, 14, 27), the present observations suggest that endogenous human brain fructose production 
may be a key underappreciated factor modulating ingested sugar’s effect on the brain. While it is possible 
that plasma fructose may cross the BBB, we observed that the rise of intracerebral fructose occurred much 
earlier (by 20 minutes) than the modest increase in peripheral fructose levels (at 180 minutes). Furthermore, 
in rats, a fructose infusion raising plasma fructose nearly 140-fold only increased brain fructose concentra-
tions by 2-fold (3). Taken together, it is highly unlikely that plasma fructose crossing into the brain signifi-
cantly contributed to the rising brain fructose levels.
In the present study, the change in brain fructose was about 30% of the change in brain glucose (~0.5 
mmol/l for fructose, 1.5 mmol/l for glucose). When considered with our recent finding that plasma fruc-
tose levels are only 0.1% of plasma glucose levels, compared with CSF in which fructose is 6%–7% of 
glucose (28), these findings suggest that relative changes in brain fructose may be greater than relative chang-
es in brain glucose levels, potentially making fructose a highly sensitive neuronal signal for carbohydrate 
ingestion. Interestingly, in Drosophila, any nutritious carbohydrate ingestion results in increased hemo-
lymph fructose levels (through the polyol pathway), which in turn acts on a nutrient sensor in the fruit fly

brain (29). Whether fructose plays a simi-
lar role in modulating nutrient sensing in 
the mammalian or human brain requires 
further investigation.
This proof-of-concept study has some 
limitations. First, using 1H MRS scanning, 
we were only able to measure changes in 
concentration and not absolute concentra-
tions of fructose in the human brain. In 
addition, because the chemical spectrum 
for sorbitol overlaps completely with the 
spectra for glucose and fructose, we were 
unable to determine changes in sorbitol 
levels, which may have contributed to the 
difference spectrum intensity. Furthermore, 
in order to maximize sensitivity of signal detection, we scanned the occipital lobe and thus were not able to 
determine whether known regional variability in glucose utilization translates to differences in polyol pathway 
activity. Finally, our study design assumes that insulin does not regulate the polyol pathway. While animal 
studies have suggested that the polyol pathway activity is purely substrate dependent and not insulin depen-
dent (30, 31), we did not directly control for the effects of insulin (or other hormones and metabolites, such as 
lactate; ref. 32) that conceivably might have indirect effects on the polyol pathway.
In light of the current obesity and diabetes epidemics, dietary fructose has garnered attention as a poten-
tial driver of these epidemics in part because of the high prevalence of high-fructose sweeteners (typically 
fructose/glucose ratios are 55:45 to 60:40) in the US diet. However, fructose is almost never consumed in 
isolation, and our finding that glucose levels drive brain fructose levels suggests that any sugar consumption 
that raises circulating glucose may in large part mediate fructose’s effects in the brain. Why the human brain 
produces fructose at such high concentrations compared with the plasma remains unclear. In humans, Glut 
5, the principal fructose transporter (33), is present predominantly on microglial cells (34, 35), raising the 
possibility that endogenous fructose production in the brain may alter neuronal and glial interactions.
A growing body of evidence suggests that chronic hyperglycemia leads to many adverse effects on brain 
function, particularly neurovascular disorders and cognitive impairment (36, 37). However, the underlying 
mechanisms behind these associations remain unclear. The current data demonstrating that fructose is 
produced in the human brain in response to hyperglycemia via the polyol pathway activity as well as evi-
dence for the presence of aldose reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the polyol pathway, throughout the

human brain, particularly in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and hippocam-
pus (11), may have particular implications for disordered eating behavior and 
disordered cognition in patients with diabetes.
Methods
Participants. Eight healthy participants with normal weight were recruited with 
flyers and advertisements from the greater New Haven area (Table 1). Exclu-
sion criteria included contraindications to entering an MRI, medication use 
(other than contraceptives for women), smoking history, illicit drug, or recent 
steroid use. Women who were breastfeeding, seeking pregnancy, or shown to 
be pregnant by urine test were also excluded.
Experimental protocol. Participants arrived at 7 AM following an over-
night fast. One i.v. catheter was inserted into a distal arm for blood sam-
pling. A second i.v. was inserted into the contralateral arm for 20% dextrose 
infusion that was adjusted every 5–10 minutes to achieve and maintain plas-
ma glucose at 12 mmol/l. Additional blood samples were obtained for mea-
surement of plasma sorbitol and fructose at baseline and 30, 60, 120, 180, 
and 240 minutes during hyperglycemia. The primary endpoint was change 
in intracerebral glucose and fructose levels. Secondary endpoints included 
changes in systemic sorbitol and fructose levels.
1H MRS scanning. Participants were positioned supine in a 4.0 T whole-
body magnet interfaced to a Bruker AVANCE spectrometer (Bruker Instru-
ments), with the head immobilized with foam inserts on top of a radiofre-
quency probe with a 1H circular coil as previously described (6, 38). After 
tuning, calibration, and acquisition of scout images for anatomical localiza-
tion, intracerebral glucose and fructose concentration signals were obtained using stimulated echo acquisi-
tion mode localization (39) in 30 × 20 × 30 mm3 voxels in the occipital lobe for 20 minutes at baseline and 
then every 10 minutes over 4 hours of hyperglycemia. The sequence parameters were TR = 2,000 ms; TE/
TM = 15 ms/10 ms; bandwidth = 5,000 Hz; sampling points = 2,048. Spectra were acquired with B0-lock 
and retrospective frequency adjustment for motion correction.
Although there is some overlap in their chemical spectra, fructose has unique peaks located at 4.0–4.1 
ppm, which were used to distinguish it from glucose (Human Metabolome Database v3.6; refs. 40, 41). 
Baseline spectra were subtracted to eliminate overlap from other brain metabolites not directly affected by 
glucose levels. Changes in metabolite levels were measured by peak integration referenced to total voxel 
water signal and creatine, in the nondifferenced spectra, to determine concentration. Glucose integrals 
were obtained by integrating the large peak from 3.32 to 3.54 
ppm and scaled back total intensity from 3.10 to 3.96 ppm in 
the free glucose spectrum (1:2.9), which contains 11 protons. 
Fructose integrals were obtained by integrating the peak from 
3.96 to 4.07 ppm and scaled back total intensity from 3.54 to 
4.20 ppm from the free fructose spectrum (1:4.8), which con-
tains 12 protons. The concentrations of glucose and fructose 
were then compared with the creatine CH3 peak in the in 
vivo spectrum, which was assumed to be 10 mmol/kg and 
which contains 3 protons. Reference solutions of glucose 
(100 mM), sorbitol (100 mM), and fructose (100 mM) were

prepared in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and measured after preheating the reference solutions to 
37°C. Spectra were acquired using the same pulse sequence and parameters as used in vivo. Sorbitol peaks 
overlapped with glucose and fructose. While the peak pattern in the difference spectra was most consistent 
with glucose and fructose, we cannot rule out some degree of sorbitol contribution.
Laboratory analysis. Plasma glucose levels were measured via glucose oxidase (YSI Inc.). Plasma sorbi-
tol and fructose were measured using gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry.
Statistics. The analyses of every repeatedly measured variable, including intracerebral glucose and fruc-
tose and plasma metabolite levels, were performed using the mixed-effects regression model method, taking 
in account within-subject correlation of repeated measures using a prespecified compound symmetry cova-
riance matrix. Age, gender, and BMI were adjusted as covariates (i.e., as fixed effects). The association of 
intracerebral fructose with intracerebral glucose levels was also modeled using the mixed-effects regression 
model, in which the glucose level was included as a covariate in addition to age, gender, and BMI. The 
association of intracerebral fructose level with plasma fructose level was modeled in a similar manner. All 
the analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.4. A 2-sided P value of less than 0.05 was considered to 
be statistically significant.
Study approval. The Yale University Human Investigation Committee (New Haven, Connecticut, USA) 
approved the protocol, and all participants provided written informed consent prior to study participation.
