Background and Purpose—There is a strong dose–response relationship between smoking and risk of ischemic stroke 
in young women, but there are few data examining this association in young men. We examined the dose–response 
relationship between the quantity of cigarettes smoked and the odds of developing an ischemic stroke in men under age 
50 years.
Methods—The Stroke Prevention in Young Men Study is a population-based case–control study of risk factors for ischemic 
stroke in men ages 15 to 49 years. The χ2 test was used to test categorical comparisons. Logistic regression models were 
used to calculate the odds ratio for ischemic stroke occurrence comparing current and former smokers to never smokers. 
In the first model, we adjusted solely for age. In the second model, we adjusted for potential confounding factors, 
including age, race, education, hypertension, myocardial infarction, angina, diabetes mellitus, and body mass index.
Results—The study population consisted of 615 cases and 530 controls. The odds ratio for the current smoking group 
compared with never smokers was 1.88. Furthermore, when the current smoking group was stratified by number of 
cigarettes smoked, there was a dose–response relationship for the odds ratio, ranging from 1.46 for those smoking <11 
cigarettes per day to 5.66 for those smoking 40+ cigarettes per day.
Conclusions—We found a strong dose–response relationship between the number of cigarettes smoked daily and ischemic 
stroke among young men. Although complete smoking cessation is the goal, even smoking fewer cigarettes may reduce 
the risk of ischemic stroke in young men.

I
ncidence of ischemic stroke (IS) in young adults is increas-
ing.1 In addition, cigarette smoking, a modifiable risk fac-
tor for IS, has been on the rise among young adults.1–4 Our 
prior research among young women suggests a strong dose–
response relationship between smoking and risk of IS,5 but 
there are few studies examining this association in young 
men. Because of potential interactions between smoking and 
hormonal milieu, a separate examination of this issue in men 
is important. The extension of our study to men allows us to 
address this issue. In this study, we examine the dose–response 
relationship between the quantity of cigarettes smoked daily 
and the odds of developing an IS in men under age 50 years.

The Stroke Prevention in Young Men Study is a population-based 
case–control study of risk factors for IS in men ages 15 to 49 years. 
All cases were recruited within 3 years of stroke between 2003 and 
2007. Controls were identified by random-digit dialing and were 
balanced with cases for geographic region of residence, age within 
5 years, and ethnicity. Never smokers were defined as those who 
had not smoked >100 cigarettes or 5 packs in their lifetime. Current 
smokers were defined as those who had smoked >100 cigarettes in 
their lifetime and also had smoked in the 30 days preceding their 
stroke (for cases) or interview (for controls). Former smokers were 
defined as those who had smoked >100 cigarettes in their lifetime 
but had not smoked in the 30 days before their stroke/interview. 
Standardized interviews were conducted to collect data on smoking 
and other vascular risk factors. Further details on study methods 
have been published.5
The study was approved by the University of Maryland at 
Baltimore Institutional Review Board, and all participants gave 
informed consent.
Statistical Methodology
Statistical analysis was conducted using SAS version 9.4. The 
χ2 test was used to test categorical comparisons. Logistic regres-
sion models were used to calculate the odds ratio for IS occur-
rence comparing smokers to never smokers. In the first model, 
we adjusted solely for age. In the second, fully-adjusted, model, 
we adjusted for potential confounding factors, including age, 
race, education, hypertension, myocardial infarction, angina,

diabetes mellitus, and body mass index. Interaction terms were 
used to examine potential effect modification by other risk factors. 
Statistical tests were 2-tailed, and P<0.05 was considered statisti-
cally significant.
Results
Among the participants, 615 of 625 cases and 530 of 537 
controls had complete data for all covariates, leaving a final 
study population of 1145 subjects. Cases were less educated 
and were more likely to have hypertension, diabetes mellitus, 
myocardial infarction, angina, and obesity (body mass index 
>30; all P<0.05). Among controls, current smokers were less 
educated and were more likely to be black than their non-
smoking counterparts (all P<0.05; Table 1).
Table 2 shows that in the age-adjusted model, the odds ratio 
for the current smoking group compared with never smokers 
was 1.88 (95% confidence interval, 1.44–2.44). Furthermore, 
when the current smoking group was stratified by number of 
cigarettes smoked, there was a dose–response relationship for 
the odds ratio, ranging from 1.46 (95% confidence interval, 
1.04–2.06) for those smoking <11 cigarettes per day to 5.66 
(95% confidence interval, 2.14–14.95) for those smoking 
40+ cigarettes per day. In the fully-adjusted model, there is a 
similar dose response observed but with slightly lower odds 
ratios. In the age-adjusted model, the odds ratio for the former 
smoking group compared with never smokers was 1.42 (95% 
confidence interval, 1.01–1.99), with similar results for the 
fully-adjusted model (Table 2).
Discussion
Our study demonstrates a strong dose–response between 
amount of cigarettes smoked and risk of IS in young men.

There is evidence for a dose–response relationship between 
cigarette smoking and risk of stroke in middle-aged and older 
adults as well; however, the association is less strong.6 Our 
finding is consistent with results from prior studies of women 
and young adults in general.2,5,7 Our earlier study among 
women similarly demonstrated a strong dose–response rela-
tionship between current cigarette smoking and IS risk.5 A 
study of young adults in Iowa demonstrated a dose response 
between amount of current cigarette smoking and IS risk but 
did not stratify their findings by sex.6 These studies demon-
strate that smoking amount is an important risk factor for 
IS but do not characterize the dose–response relationship in 
young male smokers.
Our study builds on this research by focusing on young 
men. Our results are in line with the findings of a Swedish 
study of young men that analyzed smoking history among 
military recruits ages 18 to 20 years as a predictor of IS before 
age 45 years.8 Compared with the Swedish study, a strength of 
our study is that it includes a more ethnically diverse popula-
tion and is adjusted for education.
Our study also has several limitations. Because we did 
not record the use of other tobacco products, we cannot 
exclude the possibility that concurrent use of these products 
could have affected our results. Similarly, we did not control 
for factors such as alcohol consumption and physical activ-
ity in our model, which may have resulted in unmeasured or 
residual confounding of our risk estimates. Another limitation 
of our study is the case–control design, which allows for the 
possibility of differential recall bias by case–control status. 
However, the similar findings in the Swedish study, derived 
from a cohort design, suggest that there was not a major effect 
from differential recall bias.
Smoking rates among patients hospitalized for IS have been 
increasing.1 The clinical implications of our finding are, that 
while complete cessation of smoking is the goal, even reduc-
ing the number of cigarettes smoked may have beneficial 
health effects.
