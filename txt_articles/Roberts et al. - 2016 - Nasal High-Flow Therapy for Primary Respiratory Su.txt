BACKGROUND
Treatment with nasal high-flow therapy has efficacy similar to that of nasal con-
tinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) when used as postextubation support in 
neonates. The efficacy of high-flow therapy as the primary means of respiratory 
support for preterm infants with respiratory distress has not been proved.
METHODS
In this international, multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial, we assigned 
564 preterm infants (gestational age, ≥28 weeks 0 days) with early respiratory 
distress who had not received surfactant replacement to treatment with either 
nasal high-flow therapy or nasal CPAP. The primary outcome was treatment failure 
within 72 hours after randomization. Noninferiority was determined by calculat-
ing the absolute difference in the risk of the primary outcome; the chosen margin 
of noninferiority was 10 percentage points. Infants in whom high-flow therapy 
failed could receive rescue CPAP; infants in whom CPAP failed were intubated and 
mechanically ventilated.
RESULTS
Trial recruitment stopped early at the recommendation of the independent data 
and safety monitoring committee because of a significant difference in the pri-
mary outcome between treatment groups. Treatment failure occurred in 71 of 278 
infants (25.5%) in the high-flow group and in 38 of 286 infants (13.3%) in the 
CPAP group (risk difference, 12.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
5.8 to 18.7; P<0.001). The rate of intubation within 72 hours did not differ sig-
nificantly between the high-flow and CPAP groups (15.5% and 11.5%, respec-
tively; risk difference, 3.9 percentage points; 95% CI, −1.7 to 9.6; P 
= 
0.17), nor did 
the rate of adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS
When used as primary support for preterm infants with respiratory distress, high-
flow therapy resulted in a significantly higher rate of treatment failure than did 
CPAP. (Funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council and others;

Nasal High-Flow Therapy in Preterm Infants
I
n 2014, there were more than 380,000 
preterm births (i.e., births at a gestational age 
of <37 weeks) in the United States, account-
ing for approximately 10% of all births that year.1 
Preterm infants have a risk of the respiratory 
distress syndrome. The introduction of endotra-
cheal ventilation has improved the survival rate 
among preterm infants but is associated with an 
increased risk of complications such as broncho-
pulmonary dysplasia.2
Clinicians aim to use noninvasive respiratory 
support to minimize the risk of such complica-
tions. The most widely used noninvasive ap-
proach, nasal continuous positive airway pres-
sure (CPAP), has been shown to be an effective 
alternative to endotracheal ventilation as primary 
respiratory support for preterm infants.3,4
Treatment with heated, humidified, high-flow 
nasal cannulae (high-flow therapy) is an increas-
ingly popular means of noninvasive respiratory 
support. Surveys have shown that approximately 
two thirds of neonatal intensive care units in the 
United States5 and in Australia and New Zea-
land6 used high-flow therapy. This approach has 
several reported advantages over CPAP, including 
reduced rates of nasal trauma7-9 and reduced in-
fant pain scores.10 Surveys show that it is pre-
ferred by parents11 and nursing staff.12
In a previous randomized trial comparing 
high-flow therapy with CPAP as respiratory sup-
port after extubation in infants born at a gesta-
tional age of less than 32 weeks, we found that 
high-flow therapy was noninferior to CPAP in 
preventing treatment failure.8 This finding was 
consistent with the results of other randomized 
trials of neonatal respiratory support after extu-
bation.7,9 Previous studies comparing high-flow 
therapy with CPAP as primary support have not 
shown significant differences in treatment-failure 
or intubation rates. However, these studies were 
small, single-center trials,13,14 reported interim 
data,15 or constituted a substudy of a larger trial.9
The authors of a recent Cochrane Review sug-
gested that additional, adequately powered ran-
domized trials assessing high-flow therapy as 
primary respiratory support should be under-
taken.16 We performed an international, multi-
center, randomized, controlled trial to test the 
hypothesis that high-flow therapy would be non-
inferior to CPAP as primary respiratory support 
for preterm infants (gestational age, ≥28 weeks 
0 days) with early respiratory distress.
Methods
Study Design and Oversight
Nine neonatal intensive care units in Australia 
and Norway participated in the study. The hu-
man research ethics committee at each partici-
pating center approved the study. All authors 
vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the 
data and for the fidelity of the study to the pro-
tocol, which was published previously17 and is 
available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org. The study had no commercial sup-
port, and the respiratory device manufacturers 
had no input in study design, data accrual, data 
analysis, or manuscript preparation and no ac-
cess to the study data.
Patients
Infants were eligible for inclusion if they were 
born at a gestational age of 28 weeks 0 days to 
36 weeks 6 days, were less than 24 hours old, 
and had not previously received endotracheal 
ventilation or surfactant treatment and if the 
attending clinician had decided to commence 
or continue noninvasive respiratory support. In-
fants were ineligible if there was an urgent need 
for intubation and ventilation (as determined by 
the attending clinician) or if they had already met 
the criteria for treatment failure, had a known 
major congenital abnormality or pneumothorax, 
or had received 4 hours or more of CPAP support.
Recruitment and Consent
The parents of all participating infants provided 
written informed consent. At all sites, antepar-
tum consent was sought when possible. If ante-
partum consent was obtained, infants were 
randomly assigned to a study group as soon as 
they met the eligibility criteria. If antepartum 
consent was not sought, parents of eligible in-
fants were approached at the earliest opportunity 
after birth. In addition, at the lead center (the 
Royal Women’s Hospital, Melbourne, Australia), 
the human research ethics committee approved a 
retrospective consent process (see Section 2.2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org).
Randomization
A computer-generated randomization sequence 
with variable block sizes was used. Infants were 
stratified according to gestational age (<32 weeks 
vs. ≥32 weeks) and study center. Sequentially

numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes containing 
the treatment assignment were opened as soon as 
both eligibility and consent criteria had been met.
Study Intervention
Eligible infants were randomly assigned to treat-
ment with either high-flow therapy or CPAP. 
Infants weighing 1250 g or less received caffeine 
(intravenous loading dose, 20 mg per kilogram 
of body weight) on the first day of life. Other 
aspects of care were provided according to indi-
vidual unit protocols.
Infants randomly assigned to the high-flow 
group received an initial gas flow of 6 to 8 liters 
per minute, from either the Optiflow Junior 
(Fisher and Paykel Healthcare) or Precision Flow 
(Vapotherm) device. The size of the nasal can-
nulae was determined according to the manufac-
turers’ instructions in order to maintain a leak 
at the nares. The maximum permissible gas 
flow was 8 liters per minute, as recommended 
by the manufacturer. Infants assigned to high-
flow therapy who met the criteria for treatment 
failure could receive CPAP as rescue therapy, 
initiated at 7 to 8 cm of water. Infants who con-
tinued to meet treatment-failure criteria were 
intubated and ventilated.
In the infants randomly assigned to CPAP, the 
starting pressure was 6 to 8 cm of water, 
achieved with a ventilator, an underwater “bub-
ble” system, or a variable-flow device. Treatment 
was delivered through either short binasal prongs 
or a nasal mask, according to the protocol at 
each participating center, with sizing determined 
according to the manufacturer’s recommenda-
tions. The maximum permissible pressure was 
8 cm of water. Infants treated with CPAP who 
met the criteria for treatment failure were intu-
bated and ventilated.
Changes in respiratory support were made in 
steps of 1 liter per minute (for high-flow therapy) 
or 1 cm of water (for CPAP). All infants were 
evaluated at least daily. Weaning from noninva-
sive respiratory support was considered if there 
was clinical improvement and the infants were 
receiving a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.3 or 
lower, whereas discontinuation of noninvasive 
support was considered in infants who were re-
ceiving a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.3 or 
lower, with gas flow of 4 liters per minute (in the 
high-flow group) or pressure of 5 cm of water (in 
the CPAP group); earlier cessation of support 
could be ordered at the discretion of the treating 
clinician. If further support was required after 
discontinuation of respiratory support, the ran-
domly assigned treatment was reinitiated, except 
that infants in the high-flow group with previ-
ous treatment failure could receive CPAP at the 
treating clinician’s discretion.
Study Outcomes
The primary outcome was treatment failure with-
in 72 hours after randomization. Treatment was 
considered to have failed if an infant receiving 
maximal support (high-flow therapy at a gas flow 
of 8 liters per minute or CPAP at a pressure of 
8 cm of water) met one or more of the following 
criteria: a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.4 or 
higher, a pH of 7.2 or less plus a partial pressure 
of carbon dioxide greater than 60 mm Hg (8.0 kPa) 
in a sample of arterial or free-flowing capillary 
blood obtained at least 1 hour after commence-
ment of the assigned treatment, or either two or 
more episodes of apnea requiring positive-pres-
sure ventilation within a 24-hour period or six or 
more episodes requiring any intervention within 
a 6-hour period. Infants with an urgent need for 
intubation and mechanical ventilation (as deter-
mined by the treating clinician) were also con-
sidered to have treatment failure.
Prespecified secondary outcomes included the 
reason (or reasons) for treatment failure, the use 
of mechanical ventilation within 72 hours after 
randomization or at any time during admission, 
nasal trauma, other complications, including 
complications of prematurity, and other mea-
sures of the use of respiratory support and of 
neonatal health. An additional secondary out-
come was the cost of care, calculated on the basis 
of data for infants at all participating Australian 
units (435 infants) (Section 4.1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).18 The complete list of pre-
specified secondary outcomes is provided in the 
study protocol and in Section 2.3 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
Serious adverse events were defined as death 
before hospital discharge and pneumothorax or 
other air leak during the assigned treatment. Data 
were collected until death or discharge home.
Statistical Analysis
On the basis of data from the participating Aus-
tralian centers, we estimated that treatment fail-
ure within 72 hours after randomization would

Nasal High-Flow Therapy in Preterm Infants
occur in 17% of infants assigned to receive 
CPAP. We prespecified a noninferiority margin 
for high-flow treatment of 10 percentage points 
above the failure rate for CPAP treatment. High-
flow therapy would be considered noninferior to 
CPAP if the difference in the risk of treatment 
failure and the upper limit of the two-sided 95% 
confidence interval were less than 10% and the 
lower limit of the 95% confidence interval was 
below zero. For the study to have 90% power, a 
sample of 750 infants was required.17,19
We chose this margin of noninferiority after 
considering the following factors: high-flow ther-
apy is already widely accepted in many neonatal 
intensive care units; infants in whom high-flow 
treatment failed could receive CPAP treatment, 
which we hypothesized would obviate the need 
for intubation and ventilation in some infants; 
and the primary study outcome was short-term 
efficacy, rather than death or disability (a lower 
margin of noninferiority would be required for 
death or disability). The neonatologists and par-
ent representatives who were consulted during 
the design phase of the trial agreed to this non-
inferiority margin.
The primary and secondary outcomes were 
analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. A pre-
specified subgroup analysis on the basis of ges-
tational age (<32 weeks or ≥32 weeks) and a 
per-protocol analysis (not prespecified but recom-
mended for noninferiority trials19) were performed 
for both the primary outcome and the intuba-
tion rate within 72 hours after randomization. 
For the primary outcome and dichotomous sec-
ondary outcomes, we calculated a risk difference 
(with a two-sided 95% confidence interval) in 
percentage points between treatment groups. We 
used chi-square tests to compare dichotomous 
outcomes and the appropriate parametric test 
(Student’s t-test) or nonparametric test (difference 
in medians estimated by quantile regression) to 
compare continuous outcomes. All analyses were 
performed with the use of Stata/IC software, ver-
sion 13.1 (StataCorp).
As specified in the trial protocol,17 an inde-
pendent data and safety monitoring committee, 
consisting of two neonatologists and a statisti-
cian, reviewed outcome data when the primary 
outcome was available for 250 infants and when 
it was available for 500 infants. The committee 
could recommend stopping the trial if there 
were safety concerns or if there was a highly 
significant difference (P<0.001) in the rate of the 
primary outcome between treatment groups.
Results
Duration and Cessation of Recruitment
Infants were recruited from May 27, 2013, to 
June 16, 2015. On June 12, 2015, after reviewing 
the primary outcome data for the first 515 re-
cruited infants, the independent data and safety 
monitoring committee recommended that the 
trial be stopped, since there was a highly sig-
nificant difference (P<0.001) in the rate of the 
primary outcome between treatment groups and 
continued recruitment was extremely unlikely to 
show the noninferiority of high-flow therapy to 
CPAP. The steering committee stopped recruit-
ment on June 16, 2015.
Study Patients
In total, 583 infants were randomly assigned to 
a treatment group (289 to the high-flow group 
and 294 to the CPAP group) (Fig. 1). Nineteen 
infants were excluded because they did not meet 
the eligibility criteria or their parents did not 
provide consent. The remaining 564 infants (278 
in the high-flow group and 286 in the CPAP 
group) were followed until hospital discharge or 
death and were included in the analysis. Demo-
graphic and clinical characteristics of the moth-
ers and infants were similar in the two groups 
(Table 1).
Primary Outcome
Treatment failure within 72 hours after random-
ization occurred in 71 of the 278 infants (25.5%) 
in the high-flow group and in 38 of the 286 in-
fants (13.3%) in the CPAP group (risk difference, 
12.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 
5.8 to 18.7; P<0.001). Treatment failure was sig-
nificantly more common in the high-flow group 
than in the CPAP group both among infants 
with a gestational age of less than 32 weeks and 
among those with a gestational age of 32 weeks 
or greater at randomization (Table 2).
Intubation during the First 72 Hours  
after Randomization
There was no significant between-group differ-
ence in intubation rates within 72 hours after 
randomization, either in the overall study popula-
tion or in the gestational-age subgroups (Table 2).

Nasal High-Flow Therapy in Preterm Infants
Per-Protocol Analysis
Results were similar in an analysis of the 543 
infants (264 in the high-flow group and 279 in 
the CPAP group) who were treated as specified 
by the protocol (Table 2). A total of 21 infants 
were excluded from this analysis because either 
they did not receive the assigned treatment (14 
infants) or the assigned treatment was changed 
during the primary-outcome period without the 
protocol-specified criteria for treatment failure 
or nasal trauma having been met (7 infants).
Secondary Outcomes and Adverse Events
The most common reason for treatment failure 
was a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.4 or higher 
(Table 3). Treatment failure due to an urgent 
need for intubation occurred more frequently in 
the CPAP group than in the high-flow group 
(18.4% vs. 5.6%, P 
= 
0.03). The median duration of 
respiratory support was 1 day longer in the high-
flow group than in the CPAP group (4 vs. 3 days, 
P 
= 
0.005), and infants in the high-flow group 
were significantly more likely to receive supple-

=

participating infants are reported in Section 3.3 
in the Supplementary Appendix.
There was no significant difference between 
treatment groups in the rate of death before dis-
charge (Table 4). Nasal trauma was significantly 
more common in the CPAP group than in the 
high-flow group (18.5% vs. 8.3%, P<0.001). The 
frequency of pneumothorax or other air leak 
from the lung was also significantly higher in 
the CPAP group during the assigned treatment 
(2.1% vs. 0.0%, P 
= 
0.02) but not overall (3.6% in 
the high-flow group and 2.8% in the CPAP 
group, P

prematurity did not differ significantly between 
the groups. The respiratory-support devices and 
nasal interfaces that were used initially in each 
treatment group are shown in Section 3.2 in the

The calculated total cost of the tertiary hospi-
tal stay (in U.S. dollars) per infant did not differ 
significantly between the CPAP and high-flow 
groups ($32,036 and $29,785, respectively; P 
= 
0.40). 
(Detailed information about the cost-effective-
ness analysis is provided in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 
in the Supplementary Appendix.)
Discussion
In this multicenter, randomized trial, high-flow 
treatment resulted in a significantly higher rate 
of treatment failure than did CPAP when used as 
primary respiratory support for preterm infants 
born at 28 weeks 0 days of gestation or later and 
treated in neonatal intensive care units. Enroll-
ment was stopped after a planned interim analy-
sis (after 75% of the target sample had been re-
cruited), on the recommendation of the data 
and safety monitoring committee, owing to the 
between-group difference in rates of treatment 
failure. The difference in the primary outcome 
was significant in both the primary intention-to-
treat analysis and the per-protocol analysis.
Our results contrast with those of studies of 
high-flow therapy initiated after extubation, 
which have consistently shown that the effi-
cacy of high-flow treatment is similar to that 
of CPAP.7-9,16 Unlike the infants in the trials of 
postextubation high-flow therapy, no infants 
in our study received surfactant before random-
ization.7-9 The higher rate of treatment failure 
among infants receiving high-flow therapy in 
our study may reflect its reduced effectiveness in 
infants with surfactant-deficient lungs. Although 
high-flow therapy does provide some distending 
pressure,20-22 the higher, more consistent pres-
sures produced during CPAP may account for the 
difference in treatment-failure rates that we re-
port. We chose to include only infants with a 
gestational age of at least 28 weeks, on the basis 
of increased rates of treatment failure reported 
in infants with a lower gestational age who re-
ceived high-flow therapy after extubation.8

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
In our study, intubation rates did not differ 
significantly between the groups, probably be-
cause the use of CPAP as rescue therapy for in-
fants with treatment failure in the high-flow 
group meant that subsequent intubation was not 
required in 39% of those infants (28 of 71). We 
included rescue CPAP in our trial design because 
in our previous noninferiority study of high-flow 
treatment after extubation,8 almost half of the 
infants in whom high-flow treatment failed did 
not require intubation after receiving rescue CPAP.
Although CPAP was associated with a lower 
rate of treatment failure than was high-flow 
therapy, intubation rates did not differ signifi-
cantly between the two treatment groups; in 
addition, infants in the high-flow group had a 
significantly lower rate of nasal trauma. How-
ever, infants in the high-flow group were more 
likely to receive brief supplemental oxygen, and 
the median duration of respiratory support was 
1 day longer in this group. The clinical impor-
tance of these findings is uncertain.
Blinding of the intervention was not possible; 
therefore, to minimize bias, we used prespeci-
fied, objective criteria to determine the primary 
outcome. We acknowledge that the use of CPAP 
as rescue therapy may have influenced the rates 
of secondary outcomes in the high-flow group. 
Furthermore, over half of the infants assigned to 
this group had received CPAP for a brief period 
(median, 1.6 hours) before randomization, which 
may also have influenced the outcomes.
Our study population was limited to preterm 
infants in neonatal intensive care units. Further 
studies are required to determine the safety and 
efficacy of high-flow therapy in nontertiary fa-
cilities and resource-limited settings, as well as 
in term infants.
We conclude that high-flow treatment results 
in a significantly higher rate of treatment failure 
than does CPAP, when used as primary support 
for preterm infants with respiratory distress.
