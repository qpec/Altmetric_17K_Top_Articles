Objective. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of
sarilumab plus conventional synthetic disease-modifying
antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in patients with active
moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had an
inadequate response or intolerance to anti–tumor necrosis
factor (anti-TNF) therapy.
Methods. Patients were randomly allocated to
receive sarilumab 150 mg, sarilumab 200 mg, or placebo
every 2 weeks for 24 weeks with background conventional
synthetic DMARDs. The co-primary end points were the
proportion of patients achieving a response according to
the American College of Rheumatology 20% criteria for
improvement (ACR20) at week 24, and change from base-
line in the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability
index (HAQ DI) at week 12. Each sarilumab dose was
evaluated against placebo; differences between the 2
sarilumab doses were not assessed.
Results. The baseline characteristics of the treat-
ment groups were similar. The ACR20 response rate at week
24 was significantly higher with sarilumab 150 mg and
sarilumab 200 mg every 2 weeks compared with placebo
(55.8%, 60.9%, and 33.7%, respectively; P< 0.0001). The
mean change from baseline in the HAQ DI score at week 12
was significantly greater for sarilumab (least squares mean
change: for 150 mg, 20.46 [P5 0.0007]; for 200 mg, 20.47
[P5 0.0004]) versus placebo (20.26). Infections were the
most
frequently
reported
treatment-emergent
adverse
events. Serious infections occurred in 1.1%, 0.6%, and 1.1%
of patients receiving placebo, sarilumab 150 mg, and
sarilumab 200 mg, respectively. Laboratory abnormalities
included decreased absolute neutrophil count and increased
transaminase levels in both sarilumab groups compared
with placebo. In this study, reductions in the absolute neu-
trophil count were not associated with an increased inci-
dence of infections or serious infections.
Conclusion. Sarilumab 150 mg and sarilumab
200 mg every 2 weeks plus conventional synthetic DMARDs
improved the signs and symptoms of RA and physical
function in patients with an inadequate response or intol-
erance to anti-TNF agents. Safety data were consistent
with interleukin-6 receptor blockade and the known safety
profile of sarilumab.

 Conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheu-
matic drugs (DMARDs) are the core treatment regimen
for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (1,2). Biologic
agents, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, are
indicated for RA management in patients who have an
insufficient response to methotrexate (MTX) and/or other
conventional synthetic DMARDs (1,2). However, an esti-
mated 12–30% of patients receiving anti-TNF therapy dis-
continue treatment due to lack of efficacy or intolerance
(3,4). Subsequent treatment with other biologic DMARDs
may not result in an optimal response in all of these
patients, which makes effective treatment in this popula-
tion challenging (5). In those patients with an inadequate
response, recommendations from the European League
Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the American Col-
lege of Rheumatology (ACR) suggest that switching from
1 class of biologic DMARDs to another with a different
mechanism of action may provide better clinical benefit
(1,2). As a result, alternative therapies that effectively
reduce RA disease activity are needed for these patients.
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine with
functions related to immune regulation, B cell and T cell
development, and chronic inflammation (6). Expression of
IL-6 is increased in several inflammatory disorders, and
IL-6 blockade reverses signs of systemic inflammation,
including fever and increased production of acute-phase
proteins (6,7). IL-6 has been identified in the pathophysiol-
ogy of RA (6,8,9), and IL-6 expression has been shown to
be elevated in the serum and synovial fluid of patients with
RA (10–12). Additionally, attenuation of IL-6 signaling
reduces osteoclast formation and bone erosion, both
of which are characteristic features of RA (13,14).
Tocilizumab, a humanized inhibitor of IL-6 receptor (IL-
6R) activity, administered as monotherapy or combined
with MTX or other conventional synthetic DMARDs, has
demonstrated efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe
RA (15–19).
Sarilumab is an investigational human monoclonal
antibody directed against IL-6R that has been studied in
phase IIb2III clinical trials (20,21). In the phase III, 24-
week TARGET study, the efficacy and safety of sarilumab
in combination with conventional synthetic DMARDs was
evaluated in patients with active moderate-to-severe RA
who had a previous inadequate response to or intolerance
to anti-TNF therapies.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study design. TARGET was a 3-arm, multicenter, ran-
domized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study. The
first patient was enrolled in October 2012, and the last patient
completed the trial in March 2015. The study duration was 34
weeks, consisting of up to 4 weeks of screening, 24 weeks of
treatment, and 6 weeks of posttreatment follow-up. Randomiza-
tion was performed centrally; patients were allocated 1:1:1 to
receive subcutaneous sarilumab 150 mg, sarilumab 200 mg, or
placebo every 2 weeks in combination with background conven-
tional synthetic DMARD(s) for 24 weeks. Patients were stratified
according to the number of previous anti-TNF agents (see Sup-
plementary Table 1, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology
web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.39944/
abstract) and region. The protocol was approved by the appropri-
ate ethics committees/institutional review boards (see Appendix
A), and each patient provided written informed consent before
participation in the study. The study was conducted in compli-
ance with institutional review board regulations, the International
Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical
Practice, and the Declaration of Helsinki. The study (Trial ID:
EFC10832) is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01709578).
Patient population. Eligible patients were $18 years of
age and fulfilled the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for
RA (22). Patients were included if they had active disease
(defined as a swollen joint count [SJC] of $6 [66 joints assessed],
a tender joint count [TJC] of $8 [68 joints assessed], and a high-
sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP] level of $8 mg/liter at
screening), with a disease duration of $6 months, and an inade-
quate response or intolerance to $1 anti-TNF therapy as defined
by the investigator. Study inclusion also required continuous
treatment with standard dose(s) of 1 or a combination of back-
ground conventional synthetic DMARD(s) including MTX, leflu-
nomide, sulfasalazine, or hydroxychloroquine for $12 weeks
before baseline and a stable dose for $6 weeks before screening
(simultaneous treatment with MTX and leflunomide was not
allowed). Patients were excluded if they had uncontrolled con-
comitant disease, significant extraarticular manifestations of RA,
functional class IV RA, other inflammatory diseases, current/
recurrent infections, or were receiving prednisone (or equivalent)
at a dosage of .10 mg/day (see Supplementary Table 2, available
on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.
wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.39944/abstract).
Study
treatment.
Patients
received
subcutaneous
sarilumab 150 mg, sarilumab 200 mg, or placebo every 2 weeks in
combination with background conventional synthetic DMARD(s)
for 24 weeks. Subcutaneous injections of sarilumab or matching
placebo were self-administered or administered by a caregiver.
From week 12 onward, patients with ,20% improvement from
baseline in the SJC or TJC for 2 joint assessments $4 weeks apart
were offered rescue treatment with open-label sarilumab 200 mg
every 2 weeks.
Assessments.
ACR core set components (23) were
assessed to measure disease activity at randomization, weeks 2
and 4, and every 4 weeks thereafter. Investigators were blinded
with regard to the patients’ CRP level, serum sarilumab levels,
and anti2sarilumab antibody positivity, except at screening and
baseline; an independent assessor of joints, with no access to
patient data, performed SJC and TJC measurements. Safety
parameters were assessed at each visit.
Primary efficacy end points. Two co-primary end points
were investigated: the proportion of patients achieving ACR 20%
criteria for improvement (ACR20) response (24) at week 24, and
change from baseline in physical function as assessed by the
Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index (HAQ DI)
(25) at week 12.
Secondary efficacy end points. Secondary efficacy end
points included change from baseline in the Disease Activity
278
FLEISCHMANN ET AL
 Score in 28 joints using the CRP level (DAS28-CRP) (26) at
week 24, ACR50 and ACR70 response rates at week 24, DAS28-
CRP level of ,2.6 at week 24, and change from baseline in the
HAQ DI at week 24. For a full list of secondary end points, see
Supplementary Table 3 (available on the Arthritis & Rheumatol-
ogy web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.
39944/abstract).
Safety assessments. Safety assessments included the inci-
dence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), treatment-
emergent serious AEs (SAEs), and laboratory test results.
Treatment-emergent AEs, SAEs, and AEs of special interest
were reported by investigators, and laboratory parameters were
measured. AEs were described at the Medical Dictionary for Reg-
ulatory Activities (MedDRA; version 17.1) preferred term level,
whereas AEs of special interest were identified using prespecified
search criteria. Anti-sarilumab antibody positivity at $2 consecu-
tive samplings during the treatment-emergent AE period was clas-
sified as persistent.
Statistical analysis. A sample size of 174 patients per
treatment group was calculated to detect a statistically significant
difference with 90% power in change in HAQ DI from baseline
between either dose of sarilumab plus conventional synthetic
DMARDs and placebo plus conventional synthetic DMARDs,
assuming that the change in the HAQ DI from baseline to week
24 was 20.05 in the placebo group and 20.35 in the sarilumab
groups, with a common SD of 0.79 (15). This sample size pro-
vided 99% power for the co-primary end point, the ACR20
response at week 24, based on the assumption of a 20% response
rate in the placebo group and a 50% response rate in the
sarilumab groups. Each sarilumab dose was evaluated against
placebo; differences between the 2 sarilumab doses were not
assessed. Primary efficacy and safety analyses were conducted in
the intent-to-treat population, which consisted of all randomized
patients who received $1 dose of sarilumab.
ACR20 responses at week 24 were analyzed using the
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 2-sided test, adjusted for region
and number of previous anti-TNF agents. Patients who
received rescue medication or discontinued treatment were
considered nonresponders in the primary analysis. In a sensi-
tivity analysis, the last observation carried forward (LOCF)
procedure from point of treatment discontinuation was
applied to impute missing data.
Change from baseline in the HAQ DI at week 12 was
analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures adjusted for
previous anti-TNF agents, region, visit, treatment-by-visit interac-
tion, and baseline score as covariates. In the primary analysis,
data collected after treatment discontinuation or rescue were
classified as missing. A clinically meaningful HAQ DI response,
defined as $0.22 units of improvement from baseline, is pres-
ented (27). The higher HAQ DI threshold of $0.30 units of
improvement is also reported. Sensitivity analyses for change in
the HAQ DI included LOCF and multiple imputation proce-
dures; both were used to impute missing data after rescue or
treatment discontinuation.
Categorical secondary efficacy end points were analyzed
using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 2-sided test stratified by
region and number of previous anti-TNF agents, and change
from baseline in continuous variables was analyzed using the
mixed model for repeated measures as described above.
To adjust for multiplicity, a Bonferroni correction together
with a hierarchical testing procedure was used to control the Type
I error rate at a significance level of 0.05. A nominal P value of less
than 0.025 was considered significant when all preceding end
points in the predefined hierarchy were statistically significant. Sta-
tistical significance could not be claimed for end points outside of
the hierarchy (for the complete hierarchy, see Supplementary
Table 3, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.39944/abstract).

 RESULTS
Patient demographics and baseline characteris-
tics. Of the 1,224 patients screened, 546 patients were ran-
domized and treated in 155 study centers across 27
countries (Figure 1) and comprised the efficacy and safety
populations. The baseline demographics and disease char-
acteristics were well balanced among treatment groups
(Table 1). The mean RA duration was 12.1 years, and
57.7% of the patients were categorized as being in RA
functional class II. MTX, either alone or in combination
with other conventional synthetic DMARDs, was the most
common background therapy. A majority of patients
reported prior use of 1 anti-TNF treatment for RA
(79.4%, 76.5%, and 74.6% of patients in the sarilumab
150 mg, sarilumab 200 mg, and placebo groups, respec-
tively) (see Supplementary Table 1, available on the Arthri-
tis & Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.

 used prior anti-TNF agents were adalimumab and etaner-
cept. Most patients discontinued prior anti-TNF therapy
because of an inadequate response (92.3%); thus, TAR-
GET is primarily composed of a population with an inade-
quate response to anti-TNF therapy.
Of the total population, fewer patients in the pla-
cebo group (55.8%) completed the study compared with
patients in the sarilumab 150 mg and 200 mg groups
(69.1% and 72.3%, respectively). More patients in the pla-
cebo group received rescue treatment (34.8%) compared
with the sarilumab 150 mg and 200 mg groups (13.8% and
14.1%, respectively). Treatment discontinuations due to
treatment-emergent AEs occurred in 4.4% of the placebo
group compared with 7.7% and 9.2% of the sarilumab
150 mg and 200 mg groups, respectively.
Efficacy. Statistically significant improvements in
the co-primary end points of the ACR20 response at week
24 (P, 0.0001 each) and change in the HAQ DI at week
12 (P5 0.0007 for sarilumab 150 mg versus placebo and
P5 0.0004 for sarilumab 200 mg versus placebo) were
observed in patients receiving either dose of sarilumab
compared with those receiving placebo. Treatment with
sarilumab 150 mg and 200 mg every 2 weeks produced
similar benefits for secondary clinical end points in the
hierarchy, including the ACR50 and ACR70 responses
and change in the HAQ DI at week 24. Significantly

 greater improvements in the DAS28-CRP were observed
in the sarilumab groups relative to the placebo group. In
addition, a larger proportion of sarilumab-treated patients
versus those treated with placebo achieved DAS28-CRP
scores of ,2.6 and DAS28-CRP scores of #3.2. Improve-
ments in all ACR components were observed in patients
receiving both doses of sarilumab at week 24, including
scores for patient’s assessment of disease activity and pain
(Table 2).
Improvement in signs and symptoms of RA. A sig-
nificantly greater proportion of patients receiving either
dose of sarilumab achieved ACR20 responses at week 24
(for sarilumab 150 mg, 55.8%; for sarilumab 200 mg,
60.9%; for placebo, 33.7% [P, 0.0001 versus placebo for
both doses]) (Figure 2A and Table 2). A greater proportion
of sarilumab-treated patients (48.1% of those receiving
150 mg [nominal P, 0.05 versus placebo], and 57.1% of
those receiving 200 mg [nominal P, 0.0001 versus pla-

with placebo, and the responses persisted throughout the
treatment period (Figure 2B). Results from the pre-
specified sensitivity analysis, in which the LOCF from the
point of discontinuation was used to impute missing data,
were consistent with those from the primary analyses for

 ACR20 response. Greater ACR20 response rates with
sarilumab compared with placebo were observed regard-
less of the number of prior anti-TNF agents (see Supple-
mentary Table 4, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology
web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.
39944/abstract). Although the study was not powered to
compare sarilumab doses, the ACR20 response rates
achieved with sarilumab 200 mg were numerically higher
than those achieved with sarilumab 150 mg.
Improvement in physical function. Patients receiv-
ing sarilumab 150 mg and those receiving 200 mg every 2
weeks had significantly greater improvements in the
HAQ DI than those receiving placebo (least squares mean
[LSM] change 20.46, 20.47, and 20.26, respectively [for

 discontinuation, were consistent with those of the primary
analyses. Improvements in the HAQ DI were seen in both
sarilumab groups by week 4 (nominal P, 0.01) and were
sustained throughout the 24-week study period (Figure 3B).
Greater improvements in the HAQ DI were observed with
sarilumab compared with placebo regardless of the number
of prior anti-TNF agents (Supplementary Table 4).
Compared with placebo-treated patients, more
sarilumab-treated
patients
had
clinically
meaningful
improvement in the HAQ DI (defined as $0.22 units of
improvement from baseline [27]) at week 24 (sarilumab
150 mg, 47.5% [nominal P 5 0.0137] and sarilumab
200 mg, 56.0% [nominal P, 0.0001] versus placebo,
35.4%) (Figure 3C). More sarilumab-treated patients also
showed $0.30 units of improvement in the HAQ DI
(sarilumab 150 mg, 43.1% [nominal P5 0.0165] and
sarilumab 200 mg, 47.3% [nominal P 5 0.0014] versus pla-
cebo, 31.5%) (Figure 3D).
Regional variations. There were some differences
in responses to placebo and sarilumab treatment among
the 3 regions in the TARGET study. Placebo responses
were greater in region 2 relative to regions 1 and 3, and
there was a correspondingly higher treatment response for
the 2 sarilumab groups in region 2. As a result, treatment
differences between the active-treatment and placebo
groups were maintained despite the differential responses
according to regions, with analyses of interaction tests indi-
cating
no
significant
treatment-by-subgroup
effect
according to region in the ACR20 response rates at week
24 (P 5 0.7319) or in the mean change from baseline in the
HAQ DI at week 12 (P 5 0.9407) (Supplementary Table 5,
available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://
onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.39944/abstract).
Concomitant corticosteroid treatment.
Approx-
imately 60% of patients were receiving concomitant cor-
ticosteroids at dosages of #10 mg/day at baseline. ACR20
response rates at week 24 and LSM change from baseline
in the HAQ DI at week 12 in sarilumab-treated patients
were superior to those in placebo-treated patients,
regardless of concomitant corticosteroid use (see Supple-
mentary Table 6, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatol-
ogy web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/
art.39944/abstract). When treatment-by-subgroup interac-
tion testing was performed for ACR20 response rates and
LSM change from baseline in the HAQ DI scores
according to subgroups of patients with and those without
baseline corticosteroid treatment, no statistically significant
treatment-by-subgroup interaction was observed (P for
interaction5 0.2768 for ACR20, and P for interaction5
0.8845 for HAQ DI).
Secondary efficacy end points. Clinical benefit of
sarilumab was demonstrated for most secondary end points
(Table 2). More patients receiving sarilumab achieved an
ACR50 response at week 24 compared with those receiving
placebo (37.0% for sarilumab 150 mg and 40.8% for
sarilumab 200 mg versus 18.2% for placebo; P, 0.0001 ver-
sus placebo for both doses). The rate of ACR70 responses
at week 24 was also greater with sarilumab 150 mg every 2
weeks (19.9%; P5 0.0002) and sarilumab 200 mg every 2
weeks (16.3%; P5 0.0056) relative to placebo (7.2%) (Fig-
ure 2A). Individual ACR core components were improved
in the sarilumab groups at both 12 weeks (data not shown)
and 24 weeks (Table 2).
Improvement from baseline in the DAS28-CRP at
week 24 was significantly greater in patients receiving
either dose of sarilumab compared with patients receiving
placebo. More patients in the sarilumab groups had
DAS28-CRP scores of ,2.6 (24.9% and 28.8% for 150 mg
and 200 mg, respectively, versus 7.2% for placebo
[P, 0.0001 versus placebo for both doses]) and #3.2 at
week 24 (32.6% and 40.2% for sarilumab 150 mg and
200 mg, respectively, versus 13.8% for placebo [nominal
P, 0.0001 versus placebo for both doses]) (Table 2).
Safety.
Total exposure (patient-years of treat-
ment) to double-blind treatment was slightly longer for
both sarilumab groups than for the placebo group; differ-
ences in total exposure resulted from more early termina-
tions in the placebo group relative to the sarilumab groups
(Table 3).
Investigator-reported AEs. A higher incidence of
treatment-emergent AEs was reported with sarilumab com-
pared with placebo. Infections were the most frequently
reported treatment-emergent AE across all treatment groups
(Table 3). There were 3 cases of nondisseminated herpes zos-
ter infection (n5 1 in the placebo group; n5 2 in the
sarilumab 200 mg group) but no cases of tuberculosis or sys-
temic disseminated opportunistic infection. Discontinuations
due to treatment-emergent AEs were more common in the
sarilumab groups and were generally attributable to infec-
tions, neutropenia, and increased transaminase levels. One
patient in the placebo group died due to a motor vehicle
accident.
Serious AEs were reported in 6 patients (3.3%), 6
patients (3.3%), and 10 patients (5.4%) in the placebo,
sarilumab 150 mg, and sarilumab 200 mg groups, respec-
tively. Infections were the most frequently reported SAE
across treatment groups and occurred in 5 patients (n 5 1
in the sarilumab 150 mg group, n 5 2 in the sarilumab
200 mg group, and n5 2 in the placebo group). SAEs
occurred most frequently in the sarilumab 200 mg group
and included decreased neutrophil counts, elevated trans-
aminase levels, and cardiovascular disorders. Serious car-
diovascular events occurred in 3 patients in the sarilumab
200
mg
group:
1
patient
developed
noninfectious
284
FLEISCHMANN ET AL
 endocarditis of the mitral valve, 1 patient with a prior epi-
sode of syncope developed an atrioventricular block, and 1
patient had venous thrombosis that improved with tradi-
tional management. Similar numbers of serious infections
occurred in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroids
(n5 3; 2 in the placebo group and 1 in the sarilumab
200 mg group) and in those not receiving concomitant cor-
ticosteroids (n5 2; 1 in the sarilumab 150 mg group and 1
in the sarilumab 200 mg group).
There were no cases of gastrointestinal perforation,
lupus-like syndrome, or demyelinating disorders. Hyper-
sensitivity reactions (based on a standardized Medical Dic-
tionary for Regulatory Activities query) occurred in 10
patients (5.5%) receiving sarilumab 150 mg and 11 patients
(6.0%) receiving sarilumab 200 mg, versus 7 (3.9%) of
those receiving placebo; none of the hypersensitivity reac-
tions were serious, and no cases of anaphylaxis were
reported.
Injection-site reactions occurred in 7.2% and 8.2%
of patients receiving sarilumab 150 mg and 200 mg, respec-
tively, versus 1.1% of those receiving placebo. These events
were generally mild to moderate in intensity, with no
patients discontinuing treatment because of an injection-
site reaction. Malignancy was diagnosed in 3 patients: 1 in
the placebo group (ureter carcinoma), 1 in the sarilumab
150 mg group (renal cell carcinoma), and 1 in the sarilumab
200 mg group (skin carcinoma).
Laboratory findings. Changes in laboratory values
in sarilumab-treated patients included reductions in the
absolute
neutrophil
count
and
platelet
count,
and
elevations in transaminase and plasma lipid levels (Table
3; see also Supplementary Table 7, available on the Arthri-
tis & Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.
com/doi/10.1002/art.39944/abstract). Reductions in the
absolute neutrophil count that occurred most frequently
were reductions from baseline to levels that were between

 the lower limit of normal (LLN) and $1.0 3 109/liter: for
sarilumab 150 mg, 24.9%; for sarilumab 200 mg, 29.5%;
for placebo, 3.3%. Reductions in the absolute neutrophil
count to ,1.0 3 109/liter were observed in 7.7% of
patients in the sarilumab 150 mg group, 9.8% in the
sarilumab 200 mg group, and 0.6% in the placebo group
(Supplementary Table 7). Decreases in the absolute neu-
trophil count were generally self-limited and returned
toward baseline. Few patients discontinued treatment
because of absolute neutrophil count decreases (2.8%,
1.6%, and 0.6% in the sarilumab 150 mg group, the
sarilumab 200 mg group, and the placebo group, respec-
tively). Patients with an absolute neutrophil count below
the LLN, including those with an absolute neutrophil
count of ,1.0 3 109/liter, did not have a higher incidence
of infection compared with those with a normal absolute
neutrophil count.
Increases in the alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
level of .3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in
2.2%, 4.3%, and 1.1% of patients receiving sarilumab
150 mg, sarilumab 200 mg, or placebo, respectively (Supple-
mentary Table 7). These events were generally asymptom-
atic and resolved during continued treatment or after dose
delays, with 1 patient (sarilumab 150 mg) discontinuing
treatment.
Total cholesterol levels of $239 mg/dl were ob-
served in 46.1%, 44.5%, and 24.3% of patients in the
sarilumab 150 mg group, sarilumab 200 mg group, and pla-
cebo group, respectively. The mean changes from baseline
in the high-density lipoprotein:low-density lipoprotein
ratios at week 24 were 20.04 and 20.05 in the sarilumab
150 mg and 200 mg groups, respectively, compared with
0.03 in the placebo group. Initiation of lipid-modifying
therapies (mainly statins) occurred in 7 patients (3.9%) in
the sarilumab 150 mg group and 8 patients (4.3%) in the
sarilumab 200 mg group during the study; no patients
receiving placebo began treatment with statins.
Decreases in the platelet count occurred in 6
patients, all of whom received sarilumab 200 mg (Supple-
mentary Table 7). Decreases in platelet counts from 1.0 to
$0.5 3 109/liter were observed in 5 patients (2.7%),
whereas decreases of ,0.5 3 109/liter were observed in 1
patient.
Persistent anti-sarilumab antibody positivity was
observed in 6.1%, 4.9%, and 1.1% of patients in the
sarilumab 150 mg group, the sarilumab 200 mg group, and
the placebo group, respectively. No notable differences
were observed with regard to loss of or lack of efficacy
or hypersensitivity reactions, including systemic and
local, between anti-sarilumab antibody2positive and
anti-sarilumab antibody2negative patients.
Improvements in the hemoglobin, CRP, and albu-
min levels were more frequent in patients receiving
sarilumab versus placebo. The mean hemoglobin levels
after 24 weeks of treatment were 135.1 gm/liter and 134.3
gm/liter in patients receiving sarilumab 150 mg and 200 mg
every 2 weeks, respectively, whereas the mean hemoglobin
level in patients receiving placebo was 127.6 gm/liter. Also,
fewer anemia-associated AEs occurred in the sarilumab
groups: for sarilumab 150 mg, n5 0; for sarilumab 200 mg,
n5 1 (0.5%); for placebo, n5 5 (2.8%) (Table 3). Greater
reductions in the hsCRP level were observed with both
doses of sarilumab compared with placebo (Table 2).
Serum albumin concentrations at week 24 in patients
receiving sarilumab 150 mg and those receiving 200 mg
were 41.0 gm/liter and 41.4 gm/liter, respectively, versus
38.8 gm/liter in patients receiving placebo.
DISCUSSION
In this phase III study of patients with RA who had
an inadequate response to anti-TNF therapy, both doses of
sarilumab combined with background conventional syn-
thetic DMARD(s) provided statistically significant amelio-
ration of the signs and symptoms of RA and improved
physical function compared with placebo. A significantly
greater proportion of sarilumab-treated patients, in addition
to achieving ACR20 responses, achieved ACR50 and
ACR70 responses. ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 responder
rates of 61%, 41%, and 16% observed with sarilumab
200 mg in this population with an inadequate response to
anti-TNF agents are consistent with those in patients who
had an inadequate response to MTX in the MOBILITY
trial (20) and in trials of other biologic DMARDs in patients
with an inadequate response to anti-TNF treatment (3).
Improved ACR20 response rates were observed as early as
8 weeks after treatment initiation and were sustained
throughout the 24-week study.
Treatment with either dose of sarilumab also
resulted in statistically significant and clinically relevant
improvements in physical function compared with placebo
at week 12. The improvement in physical function observed
in TARGET patients was consistent with that observed in
the MOBILITY study, which assessed the effects of
sarilumab in patients with an inadequate response to MTX
(LSM change from baseline in the HAQ DI at week 16
20.53 for sarilumab 150 mg and 20.55 for sarilumab
200 mg, versus 20.29 for placebo; P, 0.0001 versus pla-
cebo for both doses) (20) and with those observed in studies
of other biologic agents in the population of patients with
an inadequate response to anti-TNF agents (28,29). The
HAQ DI was evaluated at week 12 (landmark analysis) to
reduce the amount of missing data, because patients
286
FLEISCHMANN ET AL
 demonstrating an inadequate response were eligible for
rescue treatment at this time. However, the onset of treat-
ment benefit was rapid; HAQ DI improvements were
observed by week 4 of treatment and persisted throughout
the 24-week study. The improvement in physical function
at week 12 was clinically meaningful; a greater proportion
of sarilumab-treated patients had HAQ DI improvements
of $0.22 and $0.30 units (nominal P , 0.05) compared
with placebo.
In addition to increased ACR20 responses and
improvements in the HAQ DI, both sarilumab doses
demonstrated clinical benefit in multiple secondary effi-
cacy end points such as a DAS28-CRP of ,2.6 and a
DAS28-CRP
of
#3.2
(30).
The
observation
that
sarilumab results in improvement in the ACR core set
components, including the TJC, SJC, physician’s assess-
ment of global status, and patient’s assessment of pain,
indicates that it provides consistent and clinically mean-
ingful benefit, independent of pharmacodynamic effects
on the acute-phase reactant CRP.
Sarilumab was generally well tolerated in the
TARGET study. AEs and laboratory abnormalities
were consistent with IL-6 blockade and observations
from the MOBILITY study (20,31–33). The incidence
of treatment discontinuation due to AEs, SAEs, and
laboratory abnormalities was greater with sarilumab
compared with placebo. Infection was the most frequent
treatment-emergent AE in the sarilumab groups, but
most events were mild or moderate in severity.
Changes in clinical laboratory findings in the
sarilumab groups included reductions in the absolute neu-
trophil count and elevations in lipid and transaminase lev-
els. A decreased absolute neutrophil count was observed
more frequently with sarilumab than placebo. However,
the incidence of serious infections was similar in the pla-
cebo and sarilumab groups, with no clear relationship with
absolute neutrophil count reductions. Increases in the lipid
levels in the sarilumab groups occurred early in the treat-
ment period but stabilized by week 12, with few patients
starting statin treatment and no cases of pancreatitis.
Increases in the transaminase level were frequently
reported with sarilumab, although previous studies showed
that alterations in the ALT and aspartate aminotransferase
levels may result in part from interactions with concomi-
tantly administered conventional synthetic DMARDs such
as MTX (34,35). These changes in laboratory values are
consistent with IL-6 blockade, with reductions in the abso-
lute neutrophil count and increases in the levels of trans-
aminases and lipids being commonly reported with IL-6R
antagonists and anti–IL-6 agents (15,17,32,33,35).
At baseline, patients in TARGET had elevated
CRP levels and reduced albumin, hemoglobin, and
cholesterol
levels,
consistent
with
the
characteristics
observed in patients with moderate-to-severe disease
(36,37). Treatment with sarilumab resulted in favorable
changes in these parameters, which may be attributable to
blockade of IL-6 signaling and subsequent attenuation of
the inflammatory response (38).
Approximately three-fourths of the patients in
TARGET had been treated unsuccessfully with 1 prior
anti-TNF agent; therefore, comparison of response
rates according to the number of prior anti-TNF agents
is limited. Additionally, the benefit of sarilumab in
patients with an inadequate response to biologic thera-
pies with mechanisms distinct from that of TNF block-
ade was not evaluated in TARGET and remains a
topic for further investigation. Radiographic progres-
sion was also not assessed in this study. However, 1
study has shown that treatment with a mechanistically
distinct agent reduces progression of joint damage in
patients with an inadequate response to anti-TNF
treatment (39). In addition, evaluation of biomarkers
associated with radiographic progression may also
prove helpful for effective RA treatment (40).
The TARGET study was not powered to evaluate
statistical differences between the 2 sarilumab groups.
However, the results indicate a trend toward numerically
greater responses with the sarilumab 200 mg every 2 weeks
dosage compared with the sarilumab 150 mg every 2 weeks
dosage for several end points, including the proportion of
patients achieving ACR20 and ACR50 responses, the inci-
dence of patients with changes in the HAQ DI of $0.22
and $0.30 units of improvement, and the proportion of
patients achieving DAS28-CRP scores of ,2.6 and #3.2.
A comparable trend was observed in the 52-week
MOBILITY study, in which sarilumab at a dosage of
200 mg every 2 weeks led to greater improvements in all
co-primary end points, including reduced radiographic
progression compared with sarilumab 150 mg every 2
weeks (20). The overall incidence of AEs was similar
between the 150 mg and 200 mg groups. There was a
numerically higher incidence of SAEs with sarilumab
200 mg compared with sarilumab 150 mg, with no par-
ticular event contributing to the difference.
The TARGET population of patients with an inad-
equate response to anti-TNF treatment consisted of
patients from Central and South America, Europe, and
Asia. Although the baseline characteristics were similar
among treatment groups, higher response rates in the pla-
cebo and sarilumab groups were observed in region 2.
However, differences between the sarilumab and placebo
groups were maintained despite the differential responses
in this region; hence, sarilumab was shown to be efficacious
irrespective of geographic region.
SARILUMAB PLUS csDMARDs IN RA PATIENTS WHO WERE TREATED UNSUCCESSFULLY WITH ANTI-TNF
287
 In conclusion, sarilumab at dosages of 150 mg
every 2 weeks and 200 mg every 2 weeks plus conventional
synthetic DMARD(s) demonstrated clinical efficacy and
improvement in physical function compared with placebo
plus conventional synthetic DMARD(s) in patients with
active, moderate-to-severe RA who had an inadequate
response or intolerance to anti-TNF agents. AEs and
changes in laboratory values were consistent with IL-6 sig-
naling blockade and observations from the MOBILITY
study. These data indicate that sarilumab is effective and
generally well tolerated in patients in whom prior treat-
ment with anti-TNF agents failed.
