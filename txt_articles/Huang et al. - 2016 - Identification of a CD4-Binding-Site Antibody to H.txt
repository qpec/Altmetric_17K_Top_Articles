SUMMARY
Detailed studies of the broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that underlie the best available 
examples of the humoral immune response to HIV are providing important information for the 
development of therapies and prophylaxis for HIV-1 infection. Here, we report a CD4-binding site 
(CD4bs) antibody, named N6, that potently neutralized 98% of HIV-1 isolates, including 16 of 20 
that were resistant to other members of its class. N6 evolved a mode of recognition such that its 
binding was not impacted by the loss of individual contacts across the immunoglobulin heavy 
chain. In addition, structural analysis revealed that the orientation of N6 permitted it to avoid steric 
clashes with glycans, which is a common mechanism of resistance. Thus, an HIV-1-specific bNAb 
can achieve potent, near-pan neutralization of HIV-1, making it an attractive candidate for use in 
therapy and prophylaxis.
In Brief
Detailed studies of broadly neutralizing antibodies are providing important information for the 
development of therapies, prophylaxis, and vaccines for HIV-1. Huang et al. report a CD4-
binding-site antibody that evolved to circumvent common mechanisms of resistance, resulting in 
an antibody that achieves potent, near-pan neutralization of HIV-1.
INTRODUCTION
Generation of a humoral immune response capable of recognizing widely varied strains is 
considered a critical goal for vaccines, or passive or vectored prophylaxis, against HIV-1 
(reviewed in Burton and Mascola, 2015). Passive or vectored transfer of neutralizing 
monoclonal antibodies can completely protect Rhesus macaques or humanized mice against 
lentiviral infection (reviewed in Stephenson and Barouch, 2016). The only target of 
neutralizing antibodies, the HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env), is extraordinarily variable 
both within a patient and, to an even greater degree, within a population. However, it is 
possible for the human immune response to bind and neutralize widely varied strains of 
HIV-1 (Doria-Rose et al., 2010; Rusert et al., 2016; Sather et al., 2009; Simek et al., 2009). 
Over the past six years, the establishment of cohorts of patients with broadly cross-
neutralizing sera, advances in sorting and B cell culture, and isolation of immunoglobulin G 
(IgG) genes has permitted an extensive deconvolution of these responses through the 
isolation of monoclonal antibodies from such patients. This body of work has shown that 
within Env, which exists as a trimer of heterodimers of glycoprotein 120 (gp120) and gp41 
on the viral and cell surfaces, there are areas of sufficient conservation where targeting by 
individual broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) results in neutralization of highly 
unrelated isolates (reviewed in Burton and Mascola, 2015). Several of these antibodies are 
now in development for use in passive prophylaxis or immunotherapies.
Highly detailed studies of the structure and function of these antibodies, and the means by 
which they develop in some individuals, are providing important information for the design 
of HIV vaccines and immunotherapies (Wu et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2013; reviewed in 
Huang et al.

 Haynes, 2015). Among the broadest of these antibodies are members of a group that bind the 
CD4-binding site (CD4bs). Many of these antibodies share remarkably similar 
characteristics with regard to their immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene (VH) usage 
and mode of binding and for this reason have been designated “VRC01-class” antibodies, 
after the first identified member (Zhou et al., 2015). Some recent work using next-generation 
sequencing (NGS) of immunoglobulin transcripts has also provided insight into how these 
potent or broad antibodies might develop in an individual. Such detailed information 
regarding the co-evolution of virus and antibody provides a potential pathway for generating 
such antibodies through vaccination.
Here, we report a new monoclonal CD4bs antibody, named N6, that achieved both potency 
and remarkable breadth. The antibody evolved by a pathway that diverged from an early 
precursor to other CD4bs antibodies in the patient. We generated structural, functional, and 
NGS data that showed that the activity of N6 was mediated through novel interactions 
between multiple domains of the antibody and HIV Env. Unlike other CD4bs antibodies, N6 
had a unique mode of recognition that mediated extraordinary breadth by tolerating the 
absence of individual CD4bs antibody contacts across the length of the heavy chain. In 
addition, it was able to avoid steric clashes between the light chain and the highly 
glycosylated V5 region of Env, which are the major mechanism of resistance to VRC01-
class antibodies. Understanding the development of this antibody and its mechanism of 
neutralization provides important information regarding how highly diverse viruses might be 
targeted in immunotherapies and vaccines.
RESULTS
N6 Mediated Broad and Potent Neutralization through a Unique Mode of CD4bs 
Recognition
We sought to understand the specificities that might underlie the HIV-1-specific antibody 
response of a patient (Z258), whose serum was potent and broad (Figure S1A). The pattern 
of neutralization was similar to that of patient 45, from whom the well-known CD4bs 
antibody VRC01 was cloned. In addition, neutralization fingerprint analysis of this patient’s 
serum suggested that a CD4bs antibody was a dominant specificity (Figure S1B) (Georgiev 
et al., 2013). Consistent with this observation, a CD4bs antibody, named VRC27, was 
cloned from this patient via a probe sorting strategy. However, this antibody only neutralized 
78% of isolates and was not potent (median 50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] = 0.217 
μg/mL) (Figure 1A) and therefore did not appear to fully explain the breadth and potency of 
this patient’s serum. We therefore applied a technique to isolate monoclonal antibodies of 
interest from peripheral-blood B cells without prior knowledge of the target specificity 
(Huang et al., 2013). Peripheral-blood IgM−, IgA−, and IgD− memory B cells of patient 
Z258 were sorted and expanded. The supernatants of B cell microcultures were then 
screened for neutralizing activity, and IgG genes from wells with neutralizing activity were 
cloned and re-expressed. Three neutralizing antibodies were found and named N6, F8, and 
N17, among which the N6 antibody was the most potent and broad (Figures S1C and S1D).
Consistent with most other HIV-specific bNAbs, N6 was highly somatically mutated, in both 
heavy (31%) and light (25%) chains at the nucleotide level. The N6 antibody sequence also

 contained features that were consistent with a VRC01-class antibody (Zhou et al., 2013), 
such as a heavy chain derived from the VH1-2*02 germline gene and a light chain 
complementarity determining region 3 (CDR L3) composed of five amino acids (Figures 
S1D and S1E). The light chain was IGKV1-33 derived, similar to some other VRC01-class 
antibodies such as 12A21. Although they derived from the same patient, N6 was quite 
distinct from VRC27 and differed by 33% at the amino acid level of the heavy chain.
Using a 181-pseudovirus panel, we compared the neutralizing activity of N6 with that of 
VRC27, VRC01, and other bNAbs (Figure 1A and Table S1). N6 neutralized 98% of 181 
pseudoviruses at an IC50 < 50 μg/mL. Although the breadth of many antibodies sharply 
declined at less than 1 μg/mL, at this level N6 still neutralized 96% of the tested isolates. 
The median IC50 was 0.038 μg/mL, among the most potent described thus far. In an 
extended panel of 173 clade C pseudoviruses, N6 also neutralized 98% of them at an IC50 < 
50 μg/mL and a median IC50 of 0.066 μg/mL.
To understand the binding specificity of N6, we examined its ability to compete with other 
antibodies or bind gp120 mutants. Consistent with a CD4bs antibody, N6 competed with 
CD4Ig, and other CD4bs antibodies, for binding to gp120 (Figure S1F). We measured the 
binding affinity of N6 to three HIV gp120 proteins from strains 93TH057 (a strain sensitive 
to most VRC01-class antibodies), DU172 (a strain sensitive to some VRC01-class 
antibodies), and X2088 (which is only sensitive to N6). The N6 binding affinity to 93TH057 
and DU172 was considerably higher than the binding affinity of VRC27 or VRC01 to these 
gp120 proteins (Figure S1G). Although VRC01 and VRC27 did not bind X2088, N6 bound 
it strongly. Unlike the other CD4bs antibodies tested by ELISA, N6 bound to CD4bs 
mutants: gp120 D368R and gp120 resurfaced stabilized core 3 (RSC3) Δ371I-P363N 
(Figure 1B). It is interesting to note that the RSC3 D368R mutant is commonly used to gate 
out non-CD4bs antibodies in probe-based sorting strategies. Therefore, N6 was most likely 
eliminated from analysis in prior efforts to recover CD4bs antibodies from this patient. In 
addition, N6 neutralized 16 of 20 VRC01-resistant isolates, and it did so potently (Figure 
1C).
To more precisely map the epitope of N6 on HIV-1 gp120, we tested the binding of N6 to 
alanine scanning mutants in the context of monomeric gp120JRCSF. Members of the VRC01 
antibody class are known to contact gp120 in three main areas: loop D, the CD4-binding 
loop (CD4 BLP), and the V5 region. Overall, we did not observe differences between N6 
binding and other VRC01-class antibody binding to gp120JRCSF, as measured by ELISA 
(Figure S1H). However, binding to gp120 tested in an ELISA format might not accurately 
reflect the interaction between N6 and the intact functional trimer. To better assess this 
interaction, we used a panel of HIVJRCSF Env pseudo-virus alanine scanning mutants to 
examine the neutralization potency of N6 in comparison to those of other CD4bs antibodies 
(Figure 1D). In contrast to other CD4bs antibodies, single mutations in loop D, the CD4 
BLP, or the V5 region of JRCSF showed no resistance to neutralization by N6 (Klein et al., 
2014; Li et al., 2011; Lynch et al., 2015). These results, in addition to the binding to CD4bs 
mutants described above (Figure 1B), suggested that N6 had a unique mode of recognition 
of the CD4bs that permitted it to bind Envs not bound by other members of the VRC01 
class.

 Autoreactivity or polyreactivity is a property of several HIV-specific antibodies that could 
limit their use in therapies or prophylaxis. However, N6 did not bind Hep-2 epithelial cells 
(Figure S2A), nor did it bind cardiolipin (Figure S2B), a panel of autoantigens (Figure S2C), 
or 9,400 human proteins tested in a protein microarray (Figure S2D), suggesting that 
autoreactivity might not limit the potential use of N6 in HIV-1 prophylaxis, treatment, and 
prevention.
N6 Bound Envs Resistant to the VRC01 Class by Avoiding Steric Clashes
To define the mechanisms by which N6 might mediate such potency and breadth, we 
performed structural analyses of the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of N6 in complex with 
HIV gp120 proteins from strains with varied sensitivities to VRC01-class antibodies 
(93TH057, DU172, and X2088, see above). The crystal structures of the complexes were 
determined to 2.40, 2.15, and 2.75 Å resolution, respectively (Table S2 and Figure 2A).
Analyses of the three structures revealed that N6 had several features in common with other 
members of the VRC01 class. The overall epitope of N6 was focused on the outer-domain 
CD4bs, with excursions to other areas (Figure 2B). All N6 CDRs except CDR H1 and CDR 
L2 were involved in gp120 recognition, with the CD4bs surface contacted by the N6 CDR 
H2 contributing ~50% of the gp120-binding surface (Figure 2C and Table S3). Several 
VRC01-class antibodies contain a large hydrophobic residue at heavy chain position 54 
(54HC) (from this point forward, for clarity, residues are displayed with a subscript defining 
the molecule), which mimics the interaction of Phe43CD4 with gp120. This feature is found 
in antibodies such as VRC27, also isolated from patient Z258. Similarly, N6 had a pocket-
filling Tyr54HC (Figure 2C). In addition, salt bridges between Arg71HC and Asp368gp120 
were conserved in N6-gp120 complexes (Figure 2D and Table S4). Although the N6 CDR 
H3 had a different conformation from that of VRC01, the CDR H3 Trp100c (Figure S1D) 
was at a similar position to VRC01 Trp100b, which interacts with loop D Asp279gp120 
(Figure 2D). Similarly to some other VRC01-class antibodies, N6 also contained the flexible 
Gly-x-Gly motif (residues 28–30) within the CDR L1 (Figure S1D), which permitted it to 
avoid steric clashes with the loop D glycan on Asn276.
To further understand those features that distinguished N6 and enabled its breadth and 
potency, we aligned gp120 components from co-crystal structures to compare the binding 
modes of N6, CD4, and other VRC01-class antibodies. Relative to CD4, the binding angle 
of N6 was altered 5–8 degrees as compared to other VRC01-class antibodies (Figure 3A), 
and the translation distance was about 0.5 Å smaller than the average translation distance of 
other VRC01-class antibodies. Consequently, the N6 light chain was also rotated compared 
to VRC01 and VRC27 (Figure 3B), as indicated by the ~2.3 Å shift (Cα-Cα distance) of 
CDR L3 Gln96N6 from the position of Glu96VRC01. The axis of N6 was rotated about 10 
degrees toward the conserved loop D and tilted ~6 degrees away from the gp120 surface 
compared to the axis of VRC01 (Figure 3C and Figure S3A). This increased the N6 binding 
surface on loop D by 20% and decreased that on variable loop V5 and the outer-domain-
exiting loop by 25% (Figure 3D). The combination of rotation and tilting, pivoting around 
Arg71HC, caused the N6 light-chain N terminus and CDR L3 to move away from the highly 
variable loop V5 (Figure S3A). As a result, the conserved hydrogen bond between CDR L3

 Glu/Gln and Gly459gp120 became a water-mediated hydrogen bond in the N6 structure 
(Figure 3E). The N terminus of the light chain and CDR H2 residues 60–62 of VRC01-class 
antibodies can be visualized as an index finger and thumb of a hand that grabs the gp120 
variable loop V5 (Figure 3F). Changes in gp120 V5 that cause steric clashes with an 
antibody CDR H2, light-chain N terminus, or CDR L3 are well-described mechanisms of 
HIV-1 resistance to VRC01-class antibodies (Lynch et al., 2015). The N6 CDR H2 evolved 
to contain a Gly60GlyGly62 that is not present in any other previously isolated CD4bs 
antibodies (Figure 3F) to the best of our knowledge. This complete loss of side chains in 
CDR H2 residues 60–62, in addition to the rotation- and tilt-mediated retreat of the light-
chain N terminus, shortened the thumb and index finger that permits N6 to accommodate 
variations at the gp120 V5 loop (Figure S3B). It is important to note that the unique 
orientation of the N6 light chain was not due to special features of the light chain, or heavy 
and light chain interface, given these overlapped with those of VRC27 when structurally 
aligned by antibody sequence (Figure S3B). Rather, it appears that the binding mode or 
orientation of the N6 heavy chain permitted this rotation of the light chain. Overall, N6 
evolved a series of unique structural solutions to focus more binding surface on conserved 
loop D and tolerate changes in variable loop V5 that result in steric clashes with other 
VRC01-class antibodies.
HIV-1 clade G strain X2088 is one of the viruses that is resistant to almost all CD4bs 
antibodies isolated so far. However, N6 was able to potently neutralize X2088 (IC50 = 0.048 
μg/mL). Sequence analysis indicated that X2088 had a long V5 loop. In addition, although 
most easy-to-neutralize isolates have glycines at the base of V5 at positions 458 and 459, 
X2088 had a Val459 followed by a potential glycosylation site at Asn460X2088. 
Furthermore, there was a five-residue insertion in loop E, with a potential glycosylation site. 
The co-crystal structure of N6-X2088 gp120 revealed that N6 had developed multiple ways 
to accommodate these recognition constraints. The retreat of the N6 light-chain N terminus 
and water-mediated hydrogen bond between CDR L3 Gln96N6 and the main chain N of 
residue 459gp120 cleared space for these different features at the base of V5 (Figure 3G). 
Even though we did not observe a glycan attached to Asn460X2088, the N6 CDR H2 
Gly60GlyGly62, toward which Asn460X2088 protrudes, would not clash with a glycan at this 
position should one occur (Figures 3E and 3G). The structural analysis showed that the loop 
E insertion added one full turn at the end of the α2 helix and an N-linked glycan in the 
middle that protruded directly toward the N6 CDR L1 (Figure 3G, left panels). However, the 
rotation and tilting of the N6 light chain moved its CDR L1 away to accommodate these 
features (Figure 3G, left panel). When VRC01 in its gp120-bound orientation was modeled 
into the N6-X2088 complex, the CDR L1 of VRC01 had a severe steric clash with this loop 
E insertion and glycan (Figure 3G, right panels, and Figure S3C). Moreover, the VRC01 
light-chain N terminus and bulky CDR H2 Arg61 created a narrow path that could not 
accommodate X2088 (Figure 3F and 3G, right panels). Taken together, the evolved features 
of N6, such as the Gly60GlyGly62 motif in CDR H2 and the unique rotation and tilting of the 
light chain, combined to circumvent the mechanisms of resistance of X2088.

 Epitope Mapping Reveals that N6 Tolerates Mutations in Known CD4bs Antibody Contacts
To better understand the relative role of contacts defined in the crystal structure, we analyzed 
the viral sequences with resistance to neutralization by N6. In prior work, resistance to 
VRC01-class antibodies has typically been mediated by mutations in known contact areas in 
loop D, the CD4 BLP, or V5 of gp120 (Lynch et al., 2015). Of 181 tested viruses, only four 
were highly resistant to N6, with an IC50 > 50 μg/mL (Figure S4A). Consistent with some 
prior observations (Doria-Rose et al., 2014; Lynch et al., 2015; Moore et al., 2012; Richman 
et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2012), pseudoviruses expressing autologous Envs were also resistant 
to N6-mediated neutralization (Table S5 and Figure S4A). Each of these viruses had 
mutations in loop D, the CD4 BLP, and the V5 region relative to the reference sequences 
(Figure 4A, Figure S4A, and Table S4). To determine the relative contributions of these 
mutations to resistance to N6, we reverse mutated resistant pseudo-viruses to a sensitive 
viral sequence, HIVJRCSF (Figure 4A). Only when sequences from HIVJRCSF were 
introduced into loop D did all the pseudoviruses become highly sensitive to neutralization by 
N6. In contrast, reverse mutations in loop D, the CD4 BLP, and the V5 region were required 
for full sensitivity to other CD4bs antibodies. Similarly, when tested by ELISA, reverse 
mutations at residues in loop D resulted in strong N6-mediated gp120 binding (Figure S4B), 
while reverse mutations in loop D, the CD4 BLP, and the V5 region were required for 
binding of the other CD4bs antibodies. Consistent with this result, substitution of the JRCSF 
loop D sequence by that of Z258.2012.SGA5 dramatically decreased the neutralization 
sensitivity to N6 by 11-fold (Figure S4C, right panel), whereas CD4 BLP and V5 swaps 
showed little or no significant change. Reverse mutations of individual positions revealed 
that only when the conserved residue Asp from HIVJRCSF was introduced into position 279 
did most of the pseudoviruses become sensitive to neutralization by N6 (Figure 4A). The 
three N6-resistant pseudoviruses, T278-50, TV1.29, and BL01, and the autologous virus 
each have a mutation in position 279. The only exception was 6471.V1.C16, which has 
mutations at multiple positions within loop D, including the sequon predicted to add a 
glycan at Asn278 (Figure S4A). It is likely that resistance to N6 is mediated by the residues 
at position 279 that disrupt the contact with the CDR H3 Trp100c (Figure 4B). The 
mutagenesis suggested that resistance to N6 neutralization required mutations in loop D. 
However, unlike other CD4bs antibodies, N6 tolerated mutations in the CD4 BLP and V5 
region (Figure 4B), including those that might cause a steric clash with the CDR H2 and 
CDR L3 of other VRC01-class antibodies.
Breadth and Potency is Attributable to Multiple Elements within the N6 Heavy and Light 
Chains
To understand the paratope of N6, we designed a panel of N6 alanine scanning mutants to 
examine the impact on the neutralization potency of N6 against six VRC01-sensitive 
pseudoviruses. Several changes made a greater than 5-fold decrease in average neutralization 
potency for VRC01 and VRC27 (Figure 5A and Table S6). The Trp100bVRC01 and 
Trp100cVRC27 alanine mutations within the CDR H3 had large effects presumably due to 
disruptions of interactions with Asp279gp120. In addition, scattered changes across the heavy 
and light chains also had large effects (Figure 5A and Table S6). However, no such effect 
was observed in alanine point mutations of N6. Thus, N6 was able to tolerate single

 mutations across the length of the heavy and light chains presumably because there was 
sufficient energy spread across the remaining contacts to mediate binding.
We also examined the neutralization potency of N6 alanine scanning mutants against six 
VRC01-resistant viruses, which contain mutations in loop D, the CD4 BLP, and the V5 loop. 
Mutation of Ile33, Trp47, Trp50, Arg71, and Trp 100c of the N6 heavy chain and Ile91 of 
the N6 light chain to alanine markedly diminished neutralization potency against these 
VRC01-resistant viruses (Table S7). However, contacts at these residues do not fully explain 
the activity of N6 against such viruses given that these residues at these positions are the 
same as those of VRC27.
Next, we sought to determine the regions of the N6 heavy or light chains that played an 
essential role in its neutralization breadth and potency. As shown in Figure 5B, the 
combination of N6 heavy chain and VRC01, VRC27, or 12A21 light chain increased the 
antibody neutralizing potency and breadth relative to VRC01, VRC27, or 12A21, 
respectively. However, the combination of N6 light chain and the VRC01, VRC27, or 12A21 
heavy chain showed no change in breadth. This result is potentially consistent with the 
structural data that suggested that the ability of N6 to bind VRC01-resistant viruses, 
although permitted by the light chain orientation, is primarily mediated by the conformation 
and orientation adopted by the heavy chain.
To further understand the domains of N6 responsible for its breadth and potency, we also 
substituted portions of N6 into other antibodies of the VRC01-class. Substitution of the key 
areas of N6 interaction with gp120 into VRC01 did not increase its breadth or potency 
(Figure S5). Introduction of each of the N6 framework regions (FRs) and CDRs into VRC27 
also did not have a dramatic effect (Figure 5C). Overall, we did not observe a large increase 
in activity among VRC01-class antibodies by substitution of sequence elements from N6.
We then examined whether the activity of N6 against resistant viruses was diminished by 
mutating the FR and CDRs of N6 to those of other members of the VRC01-class (Figure 5D 
and Figure S5). Substitution of Tyr54N6 with Gly54VRC01 and Gly60GlyGly62N6 with 
corresponding residues of VRC01 each caused large decreases in neutralization. However, 
the largest decrease in the activity against these viruses was caused by the substitutions of 
the N6 CDRs and FRs with those of VRC01 or VRC27 (Figure 5D and Figure S5). This was 
not due to a large disruption of function by the substitutions given that the neutralization of 
sensitive isolates was unchanged. Substitutions of N6 CDR L1 and FRL3 with those of 
VRC01 also dramatically decreased the antibody neutralizing activities. These results 
suggest that each of the N6 heavy chain CDRs and FRs contributed to the potency of N6 
against VRC01-resistant viruses.
N6 Evolved from an Early Intermediate to Avoid Steric Clashes
To understand how N6 developed such extraordinary potency and breadth, we performed 
NGS of peripheral-blood memory B cell antigen receptors (BCRs) at three time points 
(2012, 2014, and 2015). The curated transcripts of both heavy and light chains showed high 
levels of somatic hypermutation (>20%) (Figure S6A). Nonetheless, heavy chain transcripts 
showing less somatic mutation (~23%) than either N6 or VRC27 were observed at the 2012

 and 2014 time points. More lineage-related transcripts were observed from the 2012 time 
point than from 2014 or 2015, most likely because more B cells were used for the NGS 
experiment. N6-like light chain transcripts were observed at all three time points (Figure 
S6A), but no heavy chain transcripts with high similarity to N6 were observed in the 2012 or 
2015 data. Overall, the vast majority of curated heavy chain sequences are closely related to 
VRC27 in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 6A). However, it should be noted that it is possible 
that some of the apparent diversity in the VRC27 branch might have been artificially 
generated by low sequence quality at the 3′ end of R2 and in the overlap between forward 
and reverse MiSeq reads. Despite this issue, the overall phylogenetic structure and inferred 
intermediates were robust. The genetic distance between the N6 and VRC27 clades and 
between early and matured members of the lineage was greater than 0.1. Becuase the 
inferred intermediates only contain mutations shared by many transcripts and the chance of 
two transcripts having identical sequencing errors is very low, the inferred intermediates 
should not be affected by sequencing errors.
To investigate the phylogenetic structure of the lineage, a maximum likelihood tree was 
constructed for the heavy chain and light chain (Figure 6A). The phylogenetic trees 
consistently showed that N6 and VRC27 formed two highly divergent groups. Both groups 
have similar heavy chain and light chain junctions and share 15 and 14 mutations in the 
heavy and light chains, respectively (Figure 6A and Figure S6B), confirming that they 
originated from a common precursor. The phylogenetic tree also showed that the two 
lineages diverged from a very early intermediate.
We then expressed the intermediates I1–I4 to determine the stage at which the N6 lineage 
gained its breadth and potency. We observed that a large increase in neutralizing activity 
against VRC01-resistant viruses occurred between I2 and I3 (Figure 6B). When mapped 
onto the N6 structure, most of the I2 to I3 mutations, which facilitated the gain of breadth, 
were at the N6 paratope that interacted directly with HIV gp120 (Figure 6C). In contrast, the 
I3 to I4 mutations, most likely accounting for the increases in potency, were located at non-
paratope sites (Figure 6C).
Additional modeling analysis indicated that most I2 to I3 mutations resolved potential steric 
clashes with HIV-1 gp120. This included the Gly60GlyGly62 motifs within the CDR H2 that 
enabled N6 to better accommodate changes in V5 (Figure 7A). Similarly, the replacement of 
Lys53, Met48, Leu82, and Gln100d either reduced the potential for steric clashes or 
improved the packing of the heavy chain or facilitated rotation of the light chain (Figures 
7B–7D). A cluster of residues was also changed at the elbow region, which possibly 
increased elbow flexibility (Figure 7E). Notably, 7 out of 18 changes from I2 to I3 were 
mapped to the gp120-binding surface (Figure 7F). Most of these were concentrated in the 
CDR H2 interactions between N6 and V5.
To understand what triggered the I2 to I3 change that led to the development of breadth, we 
then analyzed the viral sequences of VRC01-resistant viruses to determine the common 
features of those that became sensitive to the lineage in the transition from I2 to I3. When 
mapped onto the N6 co-crystal structure with gp120, several I2 to I3 mutations interacted 
with HIV-1 V5 and the outer-domain-exiting loop. These viruses shared features of bulky

 residues, glycosylation, or insertions in V5 (Figure 7G). Similarly, the patient’s virus also 
had a V5 that was longer than reference sequences and a glycosylation site (Figure 7G). 
These changes in V5 most likely drove the substitution of the Gly60GlyGly62 into the CDR 
H2 of the N6 lineage. These changes in turn permit the N6 heavy chain to adopt its unique 
orientation among the VRC01-class such that it avoids steric clashes in V5, the major 
mechanism of resistance to VRC01-class antibodies.
DISCUSSION
The results of this study provide an understanding of the evolution and mechanism of action 
of the N6 antibody that developed from a lineage of CD4bs antibodies in vivo to mediate 
extraordinary breadth and potency. Our results show that N6 gained its breadth and potency 
relative to others in its lineage by two main mechanisms. First, N6 evolved such that its 
binding was relatively insensitive to the absence or loss of individual contacts typically 
found in the VRC01 class. Second, it was able to avoid the major mechanism of resistance to 
other VRC01-like antibodies, namely changes in the vicinity of V5, that result in steric 
clashes. The result of these changes is an antibody with a remarkable ability to avoid steric 
clashes with the glycosylated V5 and tolerate mutations that might disrupt contacts in V5 or 
the CD4 BLP. It is this combination of avoiding glycan clashes and ability to tolerate 
mutations that permitted the breadth of N6.
An understanding of the evolution and mechanisms of action of the best naturally occurring 
antibodies, similar to those described here, is currently driving advances in the design of the 
next generation of immunogens for HIV. Prior work has suggested that bNAbs arise through 
a complex co-evolution of the immune response and virus, involving somatic hypermutation, 
B cell selection and expansion, viral escape mutations, and viral compensatory mutations 
that restore viral fitness. The ontogeny analysis showed that the N6 and VRC27 clades 
diverged early and then evolved in parallel. A similar mode of evolution has been observed 
for other anti-HIV bNAb lineages, including VRC01, CAP256-VRC26 (targeting the V1V2 
region), and PCDN (targeting glycan[s] in the V3 region) (Doria-Rose et al., 2014; MacLeod 
et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2015). This parallel evolution of antibody clades or sub-lineages 
might aid in the development of potency and breadth. A previous study on CD4bs antibodies 
showed that the breadth of an antibody lineage can be increased by development in the 
presence of a “helper” lineage targeting the same region (Gao et al., 2014). Similarly, the 
maturation of the VRC27 clade continued to select mutations in the V5 region, which in turn 
could have aided in development of the increased breadth of the N6 clade. Thus, cooperative 
evolution might play important roles in the development of breadth for an antibody lineage 
such as N6.
It is particularly interesting to note that through natural selection in vivo, N6 has features 
that have been engineered into other antibodies to increase potency or breadth or reduce the 
possibility of viral escape. Although the naturally occurring VH1-2*02-derived VRC01-
class antibodies thus far described mimic the interaction of CD4 with gp120, the vast 
majority do not fill a hydrophobic pocket on gp120 typically filled by Phe43CD4. 
Substitutions of hydrophobic residues for Gly54 in the antibodies NIH45-46 (Diskin et al., 
2011) and VRC07 (Rudicell et al., 2014) have resulted in large increases in potency. The N6

 antibody, through natural selection in vivo, has a Tyr54N6 that binds in this pocket and 
contributes to the potency of N6. In addition, the light chain of a VRC01-class antibody, 
VRC07, has been engineered to avoid steric clashes with the V5 loop to produce 
VRC07-523 (Diskin et al., 2013; Li et al., 2011; Rudicell et al., 2014). However, many of 
these engineered changes in VRC01-class antibodies have come at a cost of increased 
autoreactivity (Rudicell et al., 2014; reviewed in Sievers et al., 2015). VRC07-523 has only 
slightly less overall potency and breadth than N6, although it is less active against resistant 
isolates. However, this engineered antibody is autoreactive in some assays. Although natural 
autoreactive antibodies occur, especially among HIV-1 bNAbs (Liu et al., 2015), thus far we 
have not detected autoreactivity for the N6 antibody in the assays used in this study. 
Through natural selection in vivo, it is likely that B cells expressing antigen receptors with 
particularly strong autoreactivity or immunogenicity are selected against, while breadth and 
potency are maintained or favored.
The N6 antibody also has several characteristics that make it a desirable candidate for 
clinical use in prophylaxis and therapy. Of those antibodies being considered for clinical 
development, there are examples of antibodies that are extremely broad but moderate in 
potency (e.g., 10E8 or VRC01) or extremely potent and less broad (e.g., PGT121 or 
PGDM1400). However, the discovery of the N6 antibody demonstrates that this new 
VRC01-class antibody can mediate both extraordinary breadth and potency even against 
isolates traditionally resistant to antibodies in this class. The potency of N6 might further 
increase the durability of a prophylactic or therapeutic benefit in the case of passive 
administration because less antibody is required to persist to mediate an effect. VRC01 is 
currently in phase IIb efficacy trials as an intravenous infusion for HIV prophylaxis. 
Antibodies such as N6, which is 5- to 10-fold more potent, offer the possibility of 
subcutaneous administration, a more feasible approach to immunoprophylaxis. This effect 
might be further extended by introducing mutations into N6 that are able to extend its half-
life in vivo. In addition to its potency, use of an antibody with this breadth might 
dramatically limit the likelihood of transmission when used in prophylaxis or selection of 
escape mutations in the setting of therapy. The rare occurrence of N6 resistance mutations 
suggests that such mutations come at a relatively high fitness cost, which might represent a 
partial barrier to the selection of resistant mutants. In addition to potency and breadth, the 
ease with which an antibody selects resistant viruses and the replication capacity of those 
viruses could turn out to be important considerations for use of bNAbs in the therapeutic 
setting where highly diverse Envs exist.
Last, these results add to accumulating evidence suggesting that resistance to antibodies 
mediated by the addition of glycan, and the co-evolution of antibodies that avoid them, most 
likely extends to other antibodies to HIV and other viruses. Glycosylation of surface proteins 
is thought to play a dominant role in evasion of the humoral immune response in diverse 
human viral pathogens (Das et al., 2010; Helle et al., 2010; Sommerstein et al., 2015; 
Szakonyi et al., 2006; Wei et al., 2003; Zlateva et al., 2004). In the case of HIV-1, although 
some bNAbs target epitopes partially or completely composed of glycan, they can play an 
important role in immune evasion (Stewart-Jones et al., 2016; Wei et al., 2003). There is 
evidence that the humoral response preferentially targets glycan holes in a de novo response 
such as acute infection or vaccination (Crooks et al., 2015; Moore et al., 2012; Wibmer et 
Huang et al.

 al., 2013), suggesting that glycosylated areas are less immunogenic than those lacking 
glycans. Thus, mechanisms for steric accommodation of glycans are eagerly sought, as they 
might provide ways for antibodies to overcome glycan shielding. The developmental 
pathway and structural recognition by N6 exemplify one solution: a shift in antibody 
recognition to accommodate strain-specific glycans in the V5. The shift in orientation by N6 
to avoid steric clashes is reminiscent of other shifts in orientation reported in the 
development pathways of other bNAbs, including the PGT121-family of antibodies (Garces 
et al., 2015). Parallels to N6 recognition are observed with the influenza hemagglutinin 
stem-region antibody CR9114, which also shifts its recognition relative to other members of 
the VH1-69 class to accommodate a group-2-specific glycan (Pappas et al., 2014). Insights 
from the structure and developmental pathway of N6 thus might be general to overcoming 
common mechanisms of neutralization resistance of viral surface glycoproteins in the case 
of HIV-1 and other diverse viruses.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Study Patients
HIV-1-infected patients were enrolled at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases (NIAID) under a clinical protocol, and informed consent was approved by the 
NIAID institutional review board. At the time of leukapheresis, patient Z258 had been 
infected with HIV-1 for 21 years, had a CD4+ T cell count of 733 cells/μL and plasma HIV-1 
RNA of 996 copies/mL, and was not on antiretroviral treatment.
Memory B Cell Staining, Sorting, and Antibody Cloning
Staining and single-cell sorting of memory B cells were performed according to a published 
protocol (Huang et al., 2013) (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). In brief, peripheral-
blood switch-memory B cells were sorted, seeded into 384-well plates at 4 cells per well, 
and expanded with IL-2, IL-21, and CD40L for 13 days. From wells with supernatants with 
neutralizing activity, Ig genes were amplified by RT-PCR, cloned into expression vectors, re-
expressed in 293T cells, and purified with a protein-A column (GE Healthcare).
Neutralization Assays
HIV-1 Env pseudoviruses were generated by co-transfection of 293T cells with an Env-
deficient backbone (pSG3ΔEnv) and a second plasmid that expressed HIV-1 Env. 
Neutralization activity of monoclonal antibodies or serum was measured with single-round 
HIV-1 Env-pseudovirus infection of TZM-bl cells, according to standard, previously 
described protocols (Li et al., 2005). Heat inactivated patient serum or monoclonal 
antibodies were serially diluted 5-fold and incubated with pseudovirus for 30 min. TZM-bl 
cells, containing a Tat-responsive reporter gene, were then added and plates were incubated 
for 48 hr. Assays were developed with a luciferase assay system (Supplemental 
Experimental Procedures).
Binding Assays
Binding of N6 to HIVBAL26 gp120 monomers, gp120 RSC3 variants, and cross-competition 
was measured by standard ELISA (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The 50% of

 maximal binding (EC50) was calculated as the antibody concentrations necessary to reach 
half of the maximum signal.
Autologous Viruses Sequencing and Cloning
Autologous viruses from donor Z258 were obtained by plasma viral RNA extraction and 
cDNA synthesis. The resulting cDNA was then distributed in replicates that were then 
diluted such that single HIV-1 Env genomes were amplified as previously described (Wu et 
al., 2012) (Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
Formation of Protein Complexes, Crystallization, and Data Collection
The HIV-1 gp120-antibody complexes were formed by mixing EndoH treated gp120 with 
antibody Fab in a 1:1.2 molar ratio and purified by size exclusion chromatography. Fractions 
with antibody in complex with gp120 were concentrated to ~10 mg/mL for crystallization 
experiments. Crystallization conditions for all gp120-Fab complexes were obtained 
robotically and were manually optimized in hanging drops. All structure was solved by 
molecular replacement with Phaser. Iterative model building and refinement procedures 
were carried out with Coot and Phenix (Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
NGS
NGS of donor Z258 PBMC memory B cells was performed with 5′ primer-adapters to 
avoid bias. The Illumina paired reads were assembled to single end transcripts with 
USEARCH and then the low-quality reads were filtered. The V, D, and J genes were 
assigned with an in-house bioinformatics pipeline described previously (Wu et al., 2015). 
The heavy and light chains of N6 lineage-related members were identified via CDR3 
signatures. Then, the phylogenetic analysis of N6 lineage heavy chain and light chains were 
performed and developmental intermediates were inferred via MEGA6 (Supplemental 
Experimental Procedures).

 Figure 1. N6 is a CD4bs Antibody with Extraordinary Neutralization Breadth and Potency
(A) Neutralization potency and breadth of N6, in comparison to other bNAbs, against a 181-
isolate Env-pseudovirus panel.
(B) ELISA binding of N6 to the indicated proteins.
(C) Neutralization profile of N6, in comparison to other VRC01-class antibodies, against 20 
VRC01-resistant pseudoviruses. Values <0.1 μg/mL are highlighted in red, values between 
0.1 and 1 μg/mL are highlighted in orange, values between 1 and 10 μg/mL are highlighted 
in yellow, and values between 10 and 50 μg/mL are highlighted in green.
(D) Neutralization of a panel of gp120JRCSF alanine mutants by N6, in comparison with 
other bNAbs. CD4-Ig and 2G12 were used as positive and negative controls respectively. 
The numbering of JRCSF mutants is based on the HXBC2 sequence. Neutralization fold 
change was calculated as follows: IC50 of the JRCSF mutant / IC50 of the JRCSF wild-type. 
Values >5 are highlighted in yellow. See also Figure S1 and Table S1.

 Figure 2. N6 Recognition of HIV-1 gp120 Has Features in Common with the VRC01 Class
(A) Crystal structures of N6 in complex with gp120 proteins from three different HIV-1 
clades that are sensitive or resistant to VRC01. The heavy chain is colored light green and 
the light chain is colored light blue.
(B) Epitopes of N6 on HIV-1 clade AE 93TH057, clade C DU172, and clade G X2088 are 
colored light blue on the gray gp120 surfaces. The initial binding site of CD4 on the outer 
domain of gp120 is highlighted in yellow.
(C) Interactions between HIV-1 gp120 and the complementarity determining regions of N6. 
HIV-1 gp120 is shown in surface representation in a 90°-view from (A). Key residues, such 
as heavy chain Tyr 54, Arg71 and Trp100c, light chain Gln96, are shown in sticks.
(D) Typical interactions between VRC01-class antibodies and HIV-1 gp120 are present with 
N6. Shown to the left are the conserved salt bridges between Arg71 and CD4-binding site 
Asp368, and to the right, the hydrogen bond between CDR H3 Trp and loop D Asn279. The 
color scheme in both (C) and (D) is the same as in (A). See also Table S4.

 Figure 3. N6 Avoids Steric Clashes Common to Other Members of the VRC01 Class
(A) Antibody orientation relative to CD4 when structurally aligned on gp120. N6 is rotated 
more relative to gp120-bound CD4, compared to other VRC01-class antibodies.
(B) Unique position of N6 CDR L3 among the VRC01 class. Superposition of structures of 
gp120-VRC01-class antibodies indicated a unique position of N6 CDR L3. The color 
scheme is the same as in Figure 2A.
(C) When aligned on gp120, the binding axis of N6, defined as the line connecting Cα 
atoms of heavy chain Arg71 and light chain Glu/Gln96, is rotated toward loop D and tilted 
away from variable loop V5, as compared to other VRC01-class antibodies.
(D) Greater interaction of N6 with HIV-1 loop D, as compared to VRC27. When compared 
to VRC27 isolated from the same patient, N6 binding surface area on gp120 loop D 
increased ~20% and that on V5 and outer-domain-exiting loop decreased ~25% due to the 
rotation and tilting of the antibody.
(E) N6 interaction with gp120 V5. Conserved hydrogen bond between Glu/Gln96LC and 
Gly459gp120 becomes a water-mediated bond in N6. The CDR H2 Gly60GlyGly62 and the 
rotated light chain N terminus make more room on either to accommodate variations in loop 
V5.
(F) Comparison of the N6 paratope or that of VRC01 with morphology of a hand. The light 
chain N terminus and bulky side chains of CDR H2 residues 60–62 acts like an index finger 
and thumb grabbing HIV-1 variable loop V5. The rotation and tilting of light chain as well

 as the Gly60GlyGly62 mutation in the CDR H2 shortened the index finger and removed the 
thumb, leaving more space to accommodate variations in V5.
(G) Structural basis for N6 neutralization of clade G strain X2088. Rotation and tilting of N6 
resolved potential clashes with loop E insertion, and the retreated light chain N terminus and 
CDR H2 Gly60GlyGly62 made space to accommodate bulky residues and glycosylation sites 
at base of V5. When modeled in VRC01, CDR L1 had a severe clash with the loop E 
insertion, and its light chain N terminus and CDR H2 Arg61 created a narrow path that 
could not accommodate the X2088 V5. See also Figure S3.

 Figure 5. Features across the Length of the Heavy Chain Contribute to the Breadth and Potency 
of N6
(A) Alanine scanning of N6, VRC01, and VRC27. Residues with a high buried surface area 
were selected for alanine scanning. Each alanine mutant was tested for neutralization with 
six VRC01-sensitive viruses. See Table S6. Neutralization fold change was calculated as 
follows: IC50 of antibody mutant / IC50 of antibody wild-type. Residues that resulted in fold 
change values >50 are highlighted in red, values between 20 and 50 are highlighted in 
yellow, and values between 5 and 20 are highlighted in green.
(B) Neutralization of cross-complemented antibodies, including the heavy and light chains 
of the N6, VRC01, VRC27, and 12A21 antibodies. IC50 values <0.1 μg/mL are highlighted 
in red, values between 0.1 and 1 μg/mL are highlighted in orange, values between 1 and 10 
μg/mL are highlighted in yellow, and values between 10 and 50 μg/mL are highlighted in 
green. Neutralization fold change was calculated as follows: IC50 of original antibody / IC50 
of the antibody combination. Median IC50 is calculated based on VRC01-resistant viruses 
only. A value of 50 was assigned to the resistant viruses with an IC50 >50. Breadth was

mutants with substitutions of N6 heavy chain framework (FR) or CDRs.
(D) Neutralization IC50 of six VRC27-resistant viruses by N6 mutants with substitutions of 
VRC27 FR or CDRs. Neutralization fold change was calculated as follows: IC50 of N6 
mutant / IC50 of N6. See also Figure S5 and Tables S6 and S7.

 Figure 6. N6 Evolved from an Early Intermediate to Circumvent Mechanisms of Resistance to 
the VRC01 Class
(A) Paired phylogenetic tree of the N6 lineage. The curated heavy chain transcripts of the 
lineage-related members were identified using the sequence identity in CDR H3 to that of 
N6, VRC27, F8, or N17. The curated light chain transcripts of the lineage-related members 
were identified from next-generation sequencing transcripts originated from IGKV1-33*01 
and contained the five-amino-acid CDR L3 signature of the VRC01-class antibodies.
(B) Neutralization by N6 intermediate antibodies against 20 VRC01-resistant pseudoviruses.
(C) Mapping of I2 to I3 and I3 to I4 mutations onto the N6 heavy chain. It is of note that 
most I2 to I3 mutations are close to the antibody:antigen interface, whereas the I3 to I4 
mutations are distant from the interface. See also Figure S6 and Table S8.
