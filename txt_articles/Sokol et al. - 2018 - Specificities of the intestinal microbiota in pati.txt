ABSTRACT
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a common complication in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
and has been associated with poor IBD outcome. Intestinal microbiota composition in IBD patients
with CDI has not been specifically evaluated to date. The fecal microbiota of 56 IBD patients,
including 8 in flare with concomitant CDI, 24 in flare without CDI, and 24 in remission, as well as 24
healthy subjects, was studied using 16S sequencing. Analysis was performed using the Qiime
pipeline. Compared to IBD patients without CDI, IBD patients with CDI had more pronounced
dysbiosis with higher levels of Ruminococcus gnavus and Enterococcus operational taxonomic units
(OTUs) and lower levels of Blautia and Dorea OTUs. Correlation network analysis suggested a
disrupted ecosystem in IBD patients in flare, particularly in those with CDI. In patients with IBD, CDI
is associated with a more pronounced intestinal dysbiosis with specific alterations in intestinal
microorganisms.

Introduction
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a common
complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
and has been associated with a poor IBD outcome.1
CDI typically occurs after a transient microbiota
perturbation in the gut. Thus, antibiotic intake is a
major risk factor in the general population. In IBD,
as the gut microbiota is basally perturbed (i.e., dys-
biosis),2 CDI can occur even without an antibiotic
trigger.
Microbiota composition in patients with CDI is
imbalanced and characterized by decreased biodiver-
sity,3,4 as well as notable increases and decreases in
several taxa that are known to be increased and
decreased in IBD,4 respectively. For example, Bifido-
bacterium and members of Clostridium clusters IV
and XIVa (such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii or
Roseburia intestinalis) were decreased, while Entero-
bacteriaceae
and
Enterococcus
were
increased.5
However, intestinal microbiota composition in IBD
patients with CDI has not been specifically evaluated
to date.
Results
Population, microbiota composition and diversity
Our study population was composed of 56 IBD
patients, including 8 in flare with concomitant CDI,
24 in flare without CDI, and 24 patients in remission,
as well as 24 healthy subjects (HS) (Table 1). IBD
patients in flare without CDI and patients in remission
were matched to patients in flare with CDI (3:1) based
on IBD subtype and topography. None of the study
participants reported having taken antibiotics or using
colon-cleansing products for at least 2 months before
enrollment.
b diversity analysis showed a clustering of samples
by disease phenotype and a progressive microbiota
shift from HS to IBD in remission, to IBD in flare and
finally to IBD in flare with CDI (Fig. 1A-B).

 Compared with the HS samples, the a diversity
(assessed by 4 different indexes) was significantly
decreased in IBD patients, particularly in samples
from patients in flare (Fig. 1C, Fig. S1A-B). There was
no significant difference between patients with and
without CDI.
As expected, most of the bacteria from both the
IBD and HS samples belonged to the phyla Firmicutes,
Bacteroidetes,
Proteobacteria
and
Actinobacteria
(Fig. 1D), and the distribution of these phyla in the
patients was in agreement with published data.6 Firmi-
cutes and Bacteroidetes were the most abundant in
HS. In IBD patients, particularly those in flare, there
was a decrease in Firmicutes (mostly from the Rumi-
nococcaceae family) associated with an increase of
Proteobacteria (mostly from the Enterobacteriaceae
family; Fig. 1D, Fig. S1C).
Differential bacterial composition and altered
microbial network in CDI
To identify more precisely the impact of CDI on IBD
microbiota, we directly compared the bacterial com-
position of IBD patients in flare, both with and with-
out CDI, using LEfSe (Linear discriminant analysis
Effect Size).7 We identified several OTU that differen-
tiated patients with and without CDI (Fig. 1E,
Table S1). Several Blautia and Dorea OTUs were
decreased in patients with CDI, whereas several Clos-
tridium,
Ruminococcus
gnavus
and
Enterococcus
OTUs were increased in patients with CDI.
To evaluate globally the microbial gut ecosystem
and its alterations in IBD and CDI, we built a micro-
bial correlation network by phenotype (Fig. 2). In HS,
we observed a highly connected network between
many bacterial OTUs, suggesting the presence of a
balanced
and
cooperative
ecosystem.
Although
smaller than that of HS, the correlation network was
also well-connected in IBD patients in remission. In
contrast, the correlation network was disrupted in
IBD patients in flare, with separated bacterial clusters
being detected. For IBD patients in flare who also had
CDI, the alterations were even more pronounced with
a lower relative connectedness (2.1 vs 5.4 in IBD
patients in flare without CDI, p < 10¡8) and no inter-
action between several groups of bacteria, suggesting a
loss of cooperation in the ecosystem.
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this report presents
the first detailed analysis of the intestinal microbiota
of IBD patients both with and without CDI. In accor-
dance with previous studies, we confirmed that the
intestinal microbiota of IBD patients is dysbiotic.
The current study showed that CDI in patients with
IBD flare is associated with a more severe dysbiosis
than in an IBD flare without CDI. This infection is
characterized by specific alterations in intestinal
microorganisms with an impaired microbial ecosys-
tem. Interestingly, among the decreased bacterial
OTUs in patients with CDI, we identified many gen-
era known to be deficient in IBD compared with HS,
such as Blautia and Dorea.6 In addition, the Rumino-
coccus gnavus and Enterococcus OTUs that were
increased in the patients with CDI have also been
shown to be overrepresented in IBD patients com-
pared with HS.8,9 This finding indicates a deeper

 dysbiosis in IBD patients with CDI. Moreover, sev-
eral CDI features in non-IBD patients, such as
increased numbers of Enterococcus,5 were also found
in the IBD patients.
In conclusion, this study showed that in patients
with IBD, CDI is associated with a more pronounced
intestinal dysbiosis. Whether this feature is a cause or
a consequence of CDI is not established. Therefore,

 the next step will be to investigate microbiota factors
associated with the risk of developing CDI in IBD as a
prerequisite for preventive intervention.
Materials and methods
Patients and sample collection
All patients were recruited at the Gastroenterology
Department of the Saint Antoine Hospital (Paris,
France) and provided informed consent. Approval
was obtained from the local ethics committee (Comite
de Protection des Personnes Ile-de-France IV, Suivi-
theque study). A diagnosis of IBD was defined by clin-
ical, radiological, endoscopic and histological criteria.
A flare was determined by the physician in charge of
the patient based on clinical and biologic data. None
of the study participants reported having taken antibi-
otics or using colon-cleansing products for at least
2 months before enrollment. Patient characteristics
are presented in Table 1. Samples from healthy sub-
jects (HS) and from IBD patients without a Clostrid-
ium difficile infection were described previously.2
Whole stools were collected in sterile boxes and
immediately homogenized, and 0.2 g aliquots were
frozen at ¡80�C for further analysis.
Fecal DNA extraction
Genomic DNA was extracted from 200 mg of feces as
described previously.1 Following microbial lysis with
both mechanical and chemical steps, nucleic acids
were precipitated in isopropanol for 10 minutes at
room temperature, incubated for 15 minutes on ice
and centrifuged for 30 minutes at 15,000 g and 4�C.
Pellets were suspended in 112 mL of phosphate buffer
and 12 mL of potassium acetate. After RNase treat-
ment and DNA precipitation, nucleic acids were
recovered via centrifugation at 15,000 g and 4�C for
30 minutes. The DNA pellet was suspended in 100 mL
of TE buffer.
16S rRNA gene sequencing
After extraction, total DNA concentration was mea-
sured using PicoGreen (Invitrogen), and global 16S
gene DNA copy numbers were measured using a
qPCR method adapted from Maeda et al.,10 enabling
inhibition effect estimation and DNA concentration
adjustment. The sequence region of the 16S rRNA
gene spanning the variable region V3-V5 was ampli-
fied
using
the
broad-range
forward
primer,
For16S_519
(CAGCMGCCGCGGTAATAC),
and
reverse primer, Rev16S_926 (CCGTCAATTCMTTT-
GAGTTT). The amplification reaction (initial activa-
tion step at 94�C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of
94�C for 15 s, 43�C for 15 s, 68�C for 45 s and a final
incubation step at 68�C for 1 min) was performed in a
total volume of 100 mL containing 1X PCR buffer,
2 mM MgSO4, 1 U of DNA High Fidelity Taq Poly-
merase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 625 nM of each
barcoded primer (IDT), 250 mM of each dNTP
Figure 2. Bacterial microbiota correlation network. Correlation
network for the HS, IBD in remission, and IBD in flare both with-

(node) represents an OTU, the color represents its bacterial
phylum (blue: Firmicutes; green: Bacteroidetes; orange: Proteo-
bacteria), and its size represents the number of direct edges that
it has. The edge color indicates the magnitude of the distance
correlation; green indicates a positive correlation and red indi-
cates a negative correlation (determined using the Spearman
test). Statistical significance was determined for all pairwise com-
parisons; only significant correlations (p value < 0.05 after FDR
correction) are displayed.

 (Invitrogen) and the concentration-adjusted DNA
sample. A bidirectional library was prepared using the
One Touch2 Template Kit and sequenced on PGM
Ion Torrent using the Ion PGM Sequencing 400 Kit
(Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA).
16S rRNA gene sequence analysis
The sequences were demultiplexed and quality filtered
using the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology
(QIIME,
version
1.8.0)
software
package.11
The
sequences were trimmed for barcodes and PCR pri-
mers and were binned for a minimal sequence length
of 200 bp. The sequences were then assigned to
(OTUs) using the UCLUST algorithm12 with a 97%
threshold pairwise identity and taxonomically classi-
fied using the Greengenes reference database.13 Rare-
faction was performed (10,000 sequences per sample)
and used to compare OTU abundances across sam-
ples. Principal component analyses (PCA) of the Bray
Curtis distance, with each sample colored according
to disease phenotype, were built and used to assess the
variation between experimental groups. The number
of observed species, as well as the Shannon, Simpson
and Chao1 diversity indexes, were calculated using
rarefied data (depth D 10,000 sequences/sample) and
used to characterize species diversity in a community.
Clostridium difficile testing
Diagnosis of CDI was performed using a stool culture
on selective medium (TCCA, taurocholate cycloserine
cefoxitine medium) and a stool cytotoxicity assay on
MRC-5 cells. In cases in which a positive culture and
negative stool cytotoxicity assay were obtained, a toxi-
genic culture (determination of the isolate’s ability to
produce toxins in vitro) was performed.
Statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism version 6.0 (San Diego, CA) was
used for all analyses and graph preparation. For all
graphical data, the results are expressed as the
mean § SEM, and statistical analyses were performed
using the 2-tailed nonparametric Mann–Whitney
U-test or the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple
comparison test. Statistical significance of the sample
grouping for the b diversity analysis was performed
using the Permanova method (9999 permutations).
Differences with a P value less than 0.05 were consid-
ered to be significant.
Comparisons between IBD patients with and with-
out CDI was performed using the linear discriminant
analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) pipeline.7
A correlation network was built using an OTU table
and the Spearman correlation. Only OTUs present in
>50% of the samples were used. The p values were
corrected using the Benjamini and Hochberg proce-
dure to control for the false discovery rate (FDR). Cor-
relation network figures were built using Cytoscape
3.1.1. The relative connectedness of the networks was
calculated by dividing the number of significant inter-
actions (edges) by the number of taxa (nodes) in the
network. Statistical significance was assessed by a chi-
square test.
