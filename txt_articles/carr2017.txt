Aims
The appropriate management for patients with a degenerative tear of the rotator cuff 
remains controversial, but operative treatment, particularly arthroscopic surgery, is 
increasingly being used. Our aim in this paper was to compare the effectiveness of 
arthroscopic with open repair of the rotator cuff.
Patients and Methods
A total of 273 patients were recruited to a randomised comparison trial (136 to arthroscopic 
surgery and 137 to open surgery) from 19 teaching and general hospitals in the United 
Kingdom. The surgeons used their usual preferred method of repair. The Oxford Shoulder 
Score (OSS), two years post-operatively, was the primary outcome measure. Imaging of the 
shoulder was performed at one year after surgery. The trial is registered with Current 
Controlled T
rials, ISRCTN97804283.
Results
The mean OSS improved from 26.3 (standard deviation (SD) 8.2) at baseline, to 41.7 (SD 7
.9) 
two years post-operatively for arthroscopic surgery and from 25.0 (SD 8.0) to 41.5 (SD 7
.9) for 
open surgery. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis showed no statistical difference between the 
groups at two years (difference in OSS score -0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.75 to 1.22; 
p = 0.452). The confidence interval excluded the pre-determined clinically important 
difference in the OSS of three points. The rate of re-tear was not significantly different 
between the two groups (46.4% for arthroscopic and 38.6% for open surgery; 95% CI -6.9 to 
25.8; p = 0.256). Healed repairs had the most improved OSS. These findings were the same 
when analysed per-protocol.
Conclusion
There is no evidence of difference in effectiveness between open and arthroscopic repair of 
rotator cuff tears. The rate of re-tear is high in both groups, for all sizes of tear and ages and 
this adversely affects the outcome.

Symptoms from the shoulder are common,
occurring in approximately 14% of the popula-
tion. In the United Kingdom, between 1% and
2% of adults seek advice annually from their
general practitioner (GP) for symptoms from
the shoulder1 and constitute 2.4% of all GP
consultations made per annum.2 About 70% of
patients with these symptoms have rotator cuff
pathology,3 which can impair the ability to
work and affect activities of daily living.4 The
risk of a rotator cuff tear increases significantly
with age.5 In the United States, more than of
300 000 rotator cuff repairs are performed
annually at a cost of about $3 billion.6
Despite the conservative management of
rotator cuff tears, surgery is often required for
patients with persistent pain and functional
impairment.3 However, recurrent tears may
follow surgery. Recurrences are more com-
monly found in larger tears and surgery is less
successful in older patients and in those with
radiological evidence of fatty degeneration of
the rotator cuff muscles.7,8 Rates of re-rupture
range from 13% to 68%9-11 and may be asso-
ciated with a poor outcome.12 There was a
marked increase in the number of rotator cuff
repairs which were undertaken in New York
between 1996 and 2006, from 30.0 to 101.9
per 100 000 people per year.13 In the United
Kingdom there was a fivefold increase of
between 2001 and 2010.14 This involved a six-
fold increase in arthroscopic repairs compared
with a 34% increase in open repairs.15 It has
been argued that arthroscopic repair allows for

a more effective repair through better visualisation of the
tissues and causes less damage locally, allowing faster post-
operative recovery. However, which technique gives better
clinical results remains unclear.16-23
We have conducted a randomised controlled trial (RCT)
to compare the effectiveness of these two forms of repair.
Patients and Methods
The design was a pragmatic multicentre, parallel group, com-
parative effectiveness RCT of open versus arthroscopic rota-
tor cuff repair (UKUFF REC Reference Number 10/H0402/
24). The study involved 19 centres in the United Kingdom and
was conducted between November 2007 and December
2012. It was modified in 2009 with the removal of a non-
operative arm due to high rates of early crossover to surgery.
Patients were included if they were aged > 50 years with symp-
toms from a degenerative full thickness tear of the rotator cuff
and had failed to respond to conservative treatment including
physiotherapy and cortisone injection. Full inclusion and
exclusion criteria were published in the protocol.24
Surgery was either arthroscopic (fixation of tendon to
bone using only arthroscopic techniques) or open (fixation
to bone under direct vision through a surgically created
opening in the deltoid muscle). The precise technique and
method of fixation was not prescribed and surgeons used
their preferred method. Details of the technique including
the method of repair and theatre equipment were recorded,
as well as the size of the tear and the ease and completeness
of the repair. An alternative procedure was recorded if the
allocated technique could not be carried out. Surgeons had
to perform a minimum of five rotator cuff repairs per year to
be eligible to take part in the trial. The participating surgeons
represented a cross-section of high, medium and low volume
practitioners from both general and teaching hospitals.
Randomisation and masking. Recruitment of patients occurred
in two steps. Their eligibility was assessed by the local Con-
sultant Orthopaedic Surgeon who introduced the trial to
the patient using a prompt sheet and an assessment form. If
patients agreed to take part, they were randomised using an
automated service provided by the Centre for Healthcare
Randomised Trials (CHaRT) at the Health Services
Research Unit, University of Aberdeen.25 Allocation was
minimised using surgeon, age (< and > 65 years) and size of
tear (small, medium, large and massive). After randomisa-
tion the patient was considered irrevocably part of the trial,
irrespective of what occurred subsequently. In view of the
nature of the interventions, patients were aware of treat-
ment allocation.
Outcomes. The primary outcome measure was the Oxford
Shoulder Score (OSS),26 completed at two years after ran-
domisation. Secondary outcome measures included the
assessment of function and health related quality of life
using the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI),27 the
Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5)28 and the EuroQol-5D
scale (EQ-5D).29,30 The outcomes assessed pain, weakness
and loss of function. The patients rated satisfaction at
12 and 24 months and the overall state of their shoulder at
eight, 12 and 24 months after randomisation. Surgical
complications intra-operatively and at two and eight weeks
post-operatively were recorded, and also at one and two
years after randomisation. All patients who underwent a
rotator cuff repair were assessed with MRI or high defini-
tion ultrasound imaging 12 months after surgery by a clini-
cian blinded to the form of treatment.
Sample size. The sample size was constructed to detect a
difference in the OSS26 24 months post-operatively of 0.38
of a standard deviation (SD) for the comparison of arthro-
scopic versus open surgery at 80% power. This difference
was based on our experience of developing the OSS and
using it in a variety of settings, where a three-point score
difference was deemed a clinically important difference.31
The detectable difference of 0.38 was originally con-
structed by combining evidence from a direct randomised
comparison with indirect (non-randomised) comparison
data from the original non-operative arm. However, when
that arm was dropped the sample size was reassessed with
the aim of detecting the difference of 0.38 of an SD by direct
randomised comparison data only. Attrition was expected
to be low (10%) as were the effects of clustering of out-
comes within surgeon (intracluster correlation (ICC)
< 0.03).32-34 Both of these factors required the sample size
to be increased; however, the primary analysis was to be
adjusted for a baseline OSS, which conversely allowed the
sample size to be decreased by a factor of “1-correlation
squared”. Our previous studies showed that the correlation
in the OSS between the pre-operative value and that at six
months post-operatively in patients similar to the potential
participants in this trial was 0.57. Assuming a conservative
correlation of 0.5 implied that the sample size could be
reduced by 25%, and still maintain the same power. There-
fore, a study with a total of 267 patients was considered
sufficiently powered to detect a clinically important change
in each comparison, assuming that attrition and clustering
accounted for approximately 25% of variation in the data.
The target level of power was 80% and clustering was by
centre. An independent Data Monitoring Committee met
on four occasions and did not recommend any fundamental
changes to the protocol.
The primary statistical analyses were based on the inten-
tion-to-treat (ITT) principle, and thus all patients who were
randomised, irrespective of subsequent compliance, were
analysed with the randomised intervention. The outcomes
were compared using repeated measures mixed models
with centre as a random effect, and with adjustment for
minimisation variables (size of tear and age) and the base-
line values for each patient, where available, as fixed
effects. Reflecting the level of noncompliance, the effect on
the primary outcome of those patients who actually
received an arthroscopic or open repair was estimated
(a “per-protocol analysis”) by the instrumental variable
approach as described by Nagelkerke et al35 As with the
ITT analysis, the model also adjusted for centre, minimisa-

tion variables (age; size of tear) and baseline OSS score. The
learning effects of the performance of the surgeon improv-
ing during the trial were tested for by developing a covari-
ate for each surgeon that indicates increasing experience in
the trial (e.g. first patient randomised = 1; second = 2 etc).
This covariate was used in subsequent analyses to measure
the size of trend in effects over time.
Subgroup analyses were also undertaken by the size of
the tear (small versus medium/large) and age (≤ 65 versus
> 65) using tests of interaction. Subgroup analyses were
two-sided tests at 1% significance. If a patient was followed
up at eight, 12 or 24 months but was missing at baseline the
missing baseline data was replaced by the mean for the cen-
tre. Conservative levels of statistical significance (p < 0.01)
were sought reflecting the exploratory nature of these
analyses.
Results
A total of 273 from 422 eligible patients in 19 centres were
recruited during the period of the study. The trial flowchart is
shown in Figure 1. Baseline characteristics were balanced
between the two randomised groups (Table I). Table II shows
the type of procedure undertaken in each group. For the 136
patients randomised to the arthroscopic group, nearly half
(63; 46.3%) underwent a full arthroscopic repair. A few
began as an arthroscopic procedure and were converted to
open, others underwent an arthroscopic procedure and
36 (26.5%) did not undergo any surgery. Of the arthro-
scopic procedures not involving a repair, a subacromial
decompression was the most common. A total of 100
patients (73.5%) underwent the intended randomised
arthroscopic procedure, though only 63 (46.3%) had an
arthroscopic repair. Of the 137 who were randomised to

open surgical management, 85 (61.6%) had an open repair
and five (3.6%) had an arthroscopic repair. A total of 24 had
another concomitant arthroscopic procedure, the most com-
mon also being a subacromial decompression. A total of 23
did not undergo any surgery, the main reasons being related
to either medical comorbidities or that they were asympto-
matic and therefore did not require either procedure.
The size of tear was similar in the two groups. The mean
operating time was statistically significantly shorter in the
open group (open, 57.2 minutes; arthroscopic, 69.4 min-
utes; effect size -12.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) -21.4 to
-3.0, p = 0.010) as was the mean total time in the operating
theatre (open, 87.6 minutes; arthroscopic, 100.3 minutes;
effect size -12.7; 95% CI -23.5 to -1.9, p = 0.021).
A total of three patients in each group required re-admis-
sion after surgery and two in each group required revision
surgery. One in each group had a post-operative complica-
tion; one being a deep infection requiring debridement and
the other patient required a longer stay in hospital for pain
relief. All complications and revision operations were man-
aged within 17 months of randomisation. A total of three
patients died of unrelated causes during follow-up, two in
the arthroscopic group and one in the open group.
The data at two weeks after surgery are shown in Table III,
when few patients reported being pain-free and approxi-
mately two thirds were taking painkillers. Of those who
were employed, about 80% were still off work, but there
were no clinically important differences between the
groups. The data at eight weeks after surgery were similar

to those at two weeks with the exception that those with no
or mild pain improved from 35% to 50%, with the con-
comitant effect of reducing the use of painkillers from 66%
to 55%, and the number who had returned to work
increased from 28% to 55%. There were no clinically
important differences between the groups at this time.
The OSSs two years post-operatively are shown in Table
IV and Figure 2. Using ITT analysis, there was no evidence
of a difference between the two groups (difference = -0.76;
95% CI -2.75 to 1.22; p = 0.452). The CIs were small
enough to exclude the pre-specified clinically important dif-
ference of three points. The per-protocol sensitivity analysis
of the primary outcome measure produced a similar result
to the ITT analysis though the CIs were wider (difference
= -0.46; 95% CI -5.30 to 4.39; p = 0.854). There was no
evidence of any differences between the groups in any of the
measures of general health at all follow-up times. The mean
OSS increased markedly from baseline (25.7) to eight
months post-operatively (36.5) and continued to increase
although at a slower rate to 24 months (41.5).
The rate of re-tear was similar in both groups, 46.4% for
arthroscopic versus 38.6% for open surgery (relative effect:
odds ratio 1.52; 95% CI 0.84 to 2.75; absolute risk differ-
ence 9.5%; 95% CI -6.9 to 25.8; p = 0.256) (Table V).
The OSS showed a consistent pattern within each group,
whereby in those patients in whom repair of the rotator
cuff was not possible, the OSS was worse. Those with a re-
tear had a slightly better OSS and finally those with no tears
had the most improved OSS. The OSS improved in both the
arthroscopic and open groups. The next best results were
for the repaired tears that re-tore. The worst results were in
those with an irreparable tear (Table VI).
There was no evidence that any of the subgroups were
statistically significantly different at the 1% level (p = 0.843
for the size of the tear and p = 0.024 for age). The statistical
model to investigate any trend in OSS at two years as the
experience of the surgeon increased during the trial did not
show any significant learning effect (trend in OSS + 0.04
per procedure; 95%CI -0.21 to 0.29; p = 0.744).
Discussion
This multicentre trial, conducted in 19 centres in the United
Kingdom is the largest trial of rotator cuff repair ever
undertaken globally. The results have shown no significant
differences in effectiveness between arthroscopic and open
surgery. A significant improvement in the primary out-
come, the change in the OSS between baseline and two
years post-operatively, and in all the secondary outcome
measures which included the SPADI, EQ-5D and MHI5
was found with both surgical techniques. The rate of signif-
icant complications was very low and less than that
described by Moosmayer et al,36 but similar to that of Kuk-
konen et al.37 The overall rate of infection was 0.7% and
the rate of revision surgery was 1.5%.
Healed repairs have the best clinical outcome, repaired
tears that re-tore had the next best outcome and the worst
results were seen in patients with irreparable tears. The
mean difference in the OSS at two years between healed
tears, re-tears and irreparable tears was approximately
three OSS points for each. The clinical improvement seen in
the patients with re-tears may be explained by one or more
of the following factors. First, the repair may have healed
partially, resulting in a smaller tear with improved function
and less pain. Secondly, the interpretation of post-operative

by the surgery, and determining the size of a further tear is
difficult. Thirdly, the subacromial decompression and
debridement that was invariably performed in these
patients may also result in an improvement in symptoms
and function. Fourthly, there may be a treatment effect
due to the period of rest and physiotherapy after surgery.
Fifthly there may be a placebo component to the treat-
ment effect. A total of 22 patients (27.2%) withdrew from
the trial whilst on the waiting list for surgery due to reso-
lution of symptoms. Previous studies have reported that a
re-tear is more likely after repair of large and massive
tears due partly to the increased difficulty in fixing tendon
to bone securely without tension at the suture/tendon
interface and partly to the reduced healing potential in the
tendons with larger tears.7-12 In this study, re-tears were
found in all sizes of tear and we found no difference in the
rate of re-tear between small/medium and large/massive
tears. These earlier studies7-12 also link the development of
a further tear to advancing age. We, however, found no
difference in the rates of re-tear between those aged < 65
years and > 65 years. This may be because the number
of large and massive tears and patients aged > 65 was
relatively small.

 EFFECTIVENESS OF OPEN AND ARTHROSCOPIC ROTATOR CUFF REPAIR (UKUFF)
113
VOL. 99-B, No. 1, JANUARY 2017
Despite a significant increase in the rate of surgery to
repair the rotator cuff during the past ten years, evidence
for the real effectiveness of this procedure is poor.38-41 The
UKUFF trial was carried out in 19 centres representing the
real world in which rotator cuff repair is performed making
the results highly applicable. Previous studies and trials
have been small and have involved either only one or a
small number of centres, and have therefore not had the
same generalisability as this trial.
The study has limitations. The rate of withdrawal from
the planned surgery was high. We believe that this reflects
the usual rates of withdrawal from waiting lists that are
seen for this procedure in the United Kingdom. The reasons
for withdrawal included resolution of symptoms and the
development of other medical conditions that prevented
surgery taking place. The levels of withdrawal were equal
in both groups. The reasons why patients did not undergo
a repair were either that no tear was found at the time of
surgery or that it was irreparable, because it was too large,
too retracted or the quality of the tissue did not allow
secure fixation. Although caution must be used in inter-
preting these results, it is important to note that the lack of

a significant difference between the arthroscopic and open
ITT groups was also observed in the per protocol data.
In conclusion, the best outcome was seen in patients in
whom the repair had healed. The rates of re-tear were high
and re-tears were found in all sizes of tear and all ages of
patients. New strategies to improve tendon healing are
needed to improve the outcomes.
Take home message: 
- There is no evidence of benefit of arthroscopic rotator cuff
repair when compared with open repair.
- The rate of re-tear is high (40%) with no difference between the two
surgical methods of repair.
- Healed repairs have the best clinical outcome.
