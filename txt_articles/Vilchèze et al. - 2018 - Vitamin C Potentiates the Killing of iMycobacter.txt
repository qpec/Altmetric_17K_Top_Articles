ABSTRACT
The treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis (TB) is long and cumber-
some. Mismanagement of TB treatment can lead to the emergence of drug resistance in
patients, so shortening the treatment duration could significantly improve TB chemo-
therapy and prevent the development of drug resistance. We previously discovered that
high concentrations of vitamin C sterilize cultures of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant
Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Here, we tested subinhibitory concentration of vitamin C in
combination with TB drugs against M. tuberculosis in vitro and in a mouse model of M.
tuberculosis infection. In vivo, we showed that the vitamin C level in mouse serum can
be increased by intraperitoneal injection of vitamin C to reach vitamin C levels close to
the concentrations required for activity in vitro. Although vitamin C had no activity by it-
self in M. tuberculosis-infected mice, the combination of vitamin C with the first-line TB
drugs isoniazid and rifampin reduced the bacterial burden in the lungs of M.
tuberculosis-infected mice faster than isoniazid and rifampin combined in two indepen-
dent experiments. These experiments suggest that the addition of vitamin C to first-line
TB drugs could shorten TB treatment. Vitamin C, an inexpensive and nontoxic com-
pound, could easily be added to the TB pharmacopeia to substantially improve chemo-
therapy outcome, which would have a significant impact on the worldwide TB commu-
nity.

T
uberculosis (TB), caused by the bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remains a
serious global health issue, with more than a million deaths worldwide due to this
disease. The World Health Organization has set a deadline to end the TB epidemic by
2035, which includes a 90 to 95% reduction in TB incidence and in the number of
TB-related deaths (1). A major obstacle to achieving this goal remains the long
treatment time for TB (1). The treatment of drug-susceptible TB lasts 6 months and
requires the use of four drugs to achieve a cure. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases
can emerge in patients initially infected with drug-susceptible TB whose treatment is
mismanaged. The treatment of MDR-TB, which is resistant to the two most effective
first-line TB drugs isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RIF), is lengthier and involves the use of
toxic second-line TB drugs with severe side effects (2). New drugs to fight drug-
susceptible and drug-resistant TB have been developed and are in different phases of
clinical trials (3), but development and approval are long processes, and these drugs
have not been shown to shorten effective therapy. Another challenge in TB chemo-
therapy is to identify drugs that will eliminate persisters, a fraction of the M. tuberculosis
population that is refractory to killing by drugs or immune effectors. The difficulties in
eradicating these persisters leads to the establishment of a latent M. tuberculosis
infection and drug-resistant mutants (4). We have previously demonstrated that high
concentrations of vitamin C sterilize drug-susceptible, MDR, and extensively drug-

 resistant M. tuberculosis cultures and prevent the emergence of drug persisters (5). This
sterilization activity relies on the iron-dependent Fenton/Haber-Weiss reactions, pro-
ducing reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, lipid modifications, and redox unbalance
(5), as well as an increase in M. tuberculosis respiration (6), which prevents persister
formation (7). This pleiotropism led us to investigate whether the addition of vitamin
C to TB chemotherapy could decrease the time to sterilization in vitro and in a mouse
model of M. tuberculosis infection.
RESULTS
Vitamin C combined with TB drugs sterilizes M. tuberculosis cultures faster
than drugs alone in vitro. We had previously observed that cultures of M. tuberculosis
were sterilized faster with a combination of vitamin C (1 or 4 mM) and INH than with
vitamin C alone (5). Since TB treatment is based on the use of multiple drugs and not
monotherapy, and a dose of 4 mM vitamin C is difficult to achieve in vivo, we tested a
subinhibitory concentration of vitamin C (1 mM) added to a combination of INH and
RIF. While INH and RIF combined sterilized a culture of M. tuberculosis within 3 to 4
weeks, the addition of 1 mM vitamin C to this treatment shortened the sterilization time
by 7 days (Fig. 1A). This suggests that vitamin C could be used as an adjunct therapy.
Shortening chemotherapy for MDR-TB, which requires at least 2 years of treatment,
would also be beneficial. The treatment of MDR-TB is selected based on a combination
of second-line TB drugs containing at least one fluoroquinolone, one injectable, and
one conventional second-line drug, such as a thioamide. We therefore chose to test
vitamin C with the fluoroquinolone ofloxacin (OF), the injectable kanamycin (Km), and
the thioamide ethionamide (ETH). Again, the addition of vitamin C to the OF-Km-ETH
treatment shortened the sterilization time by 9 days compared to OF-Km-ETH treat-
ment alone (Fig. 1B), indicating that vitamin C does potentiate the action of TB drugs
in vitro. Based on these in vitro data, we decided to test the combination of vitamin C
with INH and RIF in a mouse model of M. tuberculosis infection.
Vitamin C level in mice is increased by intraperitoneal injection of vitamin C.
To test vitamin C in a mouse model of M. tuberculosis infection, we first had to
determine how to administer and which concentration of vitamin C to administer to
mice in order to increase the levels of vitamin C in mouse serum. Previous studies
reported that vitamin C was best absorbed in mice when given by intravenous (i.v.) or
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections rather than orally (8). i.v. and i.p. administration of
vitamin C (1 g/kg of body weight) in mice gave maximum plasma concentrations of 15
mM and 7 mM, respectively, whereas the addition of vitamin C to the drinking water
of the mice at a dose of 6g/liter only afforded a plasma concentration of 40 �M after
4 weeks (8). The administration of 4.5 g/kg of vitamin C by i.p. injection was shown to
be detrimental to mice, whereas 3 g/kg was well tolerated (9). In view of these
FIG 1 The combinations of vitamin C and TB drugs sterilize M. tuberculosis cultures. M. tuberculosis H37Rv was grown to mid-log (OD600, 0.6 to 0.8), as described
in Materials and Methods, diluted 1:100, and treated for 4 weeks with vitamin C (vitC, 1 mM), a combination of INH (7 �M) and RIF (1.2 �M), or the combination
INH (7 �M)/RIF (1 �M)/vitC (1 mM) (A); or vitamin C (vitC, 1 mM), a combination of ofloxacin (OF, 14 �M), kanamycin (Km, 41 �M), and ethionamide (ETH, 150
�M), or the combination OF (14 �M)-Km (41 �M)-ETH (150 �M)-vitC (1 mM) (B). INH, RIF, OF, Km, and ETH were used at concentrations equivalent to 10 times
their MIC. Aliquots were taken at indicated times and plated to determine the CFU. The plates were incubated at 37°
C for 4 to 6 weeks. The mean and standard
deviation are plotted (n � 3).

 published data, we tested two aqueous solutions of vitamin C (1.8 and 3 g/kg), buffered
to pH 7, and injected the solutions i.p. into uninfected C57BL/6 mice (two mice per
concentration). In the control experiment, one mouse received phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). One hour postinjection with vitamin C, serum was collected and vitamin C
was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (10). The mouse receiving
PBS had a vitamin C concentration in its serum of 0.08 mM. The two mice injected
intraperitoneally with 1 M vitamin C (1.8-g/kg dose) had vitamin C concentrations in
their serum of 0.4 and 0.7 mM, whereas i.p. injection of 1.7 M vitamin C (3-g/kg dose)
resulted in serum vitamin C concentrations of 2 and 6 mM. Although these data were
obtained from a small set of mice and the variation within each group was substantial,
the results showed that the vitamin C level in mouse serum could be increased by i.p.
injection of vitamin C. In subsequent experiments, mice received vitamin C as a
buffered aqueous 1.7 M solution by i.p. injection, corresponding to a dose of 3 g/kg.
High-dose vitamin C in combination with INH and RIF reduces lung bacterial
burden in mice. For our initial mouse experiment, we set up an acute model of M.
tuberculosis infection in which mice were infected with a low dose of M. tuberculosis
H37Rv (Table 1) via the aerosol route. Two weeks postinfection, treatment was started
for 4 weeks (Fig. 2A). Mice were divided into four groups: untreated, treated with INH
and RIF, treated with vitamin C, and treated with INH, RIF, and vitamin C. Although
vitamin C had been shown to sterilize M. tuberculosis cultures in vitro, in vivo, untreated
mice, and those treated with vitamin C had similar M. tuberculosis lung burdens over
the course of the experiment (Fig. 2A and Table 1); similar spleen burdens were also
observed at 4 and 6 weeks postinfection in the vitamin C-treated group and in the
untreated group (Fig. 2B and Table 1). The mice treated with the combination of
INH-RIF-vitamin C had a lung bacterial burden about one log lower than that of mice
treated with INH-RIF on average at 4 weeks postinfection. At 6 weeks postinfection, no
M. tuberculosis colonies were detected in the lungs of 4/5 mice treated with either
INH-RIF-vitamin C or INH-RIF, although M. tuberculosis colonies were isolated from the
lungs of one mouse in each of these two groups. No M. tuberculosis colonies were
detected in the spleens of M. tuberculosis-infected mice treated with INH-RIF or with
INH-RIF-vitamin C at 4 or 6 weeks postinfection.
In a second experiment (Fig. 2C and D and Table 1), mice were infected with a higher
dose of M. tuberculosis H37Rv via the aerosol route. The vitamin C group was omitted
in view of the poor results with this group in the previous experiment. The treatment
started 2 weeks postinfection, as previously done. The lung burden at the beginning of

 the treatment was a log higher than in the previous experiment (Table 1). In the lungs
of treated mice, the difference in bacterial burden was not statistically significant at 4
weeks postinfection but became significant at 6 weeks postinfection (P � 0.008), by
which time the mice treated with the INH-RIF-vitamin C combination had on average
1 log lower M. tuberculosis burden in their lungs than the mice treated with INH-RIF (Fig.
2C). In the mice treated with INH-RIF or INH-RIF-vitamin C, no colonies were obtained
on plates from the spleen lysates, whereas M. tuberculosis could be detected in the
spleens of untreated mice (Fig. 2D and Table 1).
Concluding remarks. These experiments demonstrate that vitamin C alone has no
activity against M. tuberculosis in mice but has the potential to boost the efficacy of
INH-RIF treatment, thus increasing the elimination rate of M. tuberculosis in mice
compared to that with INH-RIF alone. Previously, M. tuberculosis-infected mice co-
treated with vitamin C (1 g/kg, daily subcutaneous injection) and INH (25 mg/kg, daily
subcutaneous injection) for 74 days were found to have no sign of infection at the end
of treatment, whereas the mice treated with INH had visible lesions (11). These data
suggest that it is worth revisiting the effect of vitamin C on M. tuberculosis-infected
patients. Although the daily dose of vitamin C in a normal human diet is far below the
levels needed for optimal activity in vitro against M. tuberculosis, megadoses of vitamin
C have been administered to human patients, leading to high vitamin C plasma
concentrations (up to 49 mM) (12, 13), which were shown to be safe (14). In an earlier
study, terminally ill TB patients were given daily high doses (15 g/day) of vitamin C
orally for 6 to 8 months, with no side effects. Although the author did not observe any
regression of the TB lesions, the effects on the bedridden patients were described as
remarkable; they had regained appetite and physical activity (15). A 1946 study showed
that TB patients who received a daily supplement of vitamin C with their routine diet
FIG 2 Vitamin C potentiates the activity of INH and RIF in mice. CBA/J mice were infected via the aerosol route with 28 CFU (A and B) or 105 CFU (C and D)
of M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Treatment started 2 weeks postinfection. One group was left untreated. The mice received INH-RIF in their drinking water ad libitum.
Vitamin C was given by i.p. injection at a concentration of 3 g/kg, 5 days a week, for 4 weeks. At the indicated times, mice were euthanized, and lungs and
spleens were homogenized to quantify bacterial burdens. The CFU counts in lungs (A and C) and spleen (B and D) are shown for each individual animal, and
the geometric mean is indicated for each group. The limit of detection is indicated by a dotted line. No colonies were isolated in the spleens of M.
tuberculosis-infected mice treated with INH-RIF or INH-RIF-vitamin C in both experiments and are therefore not shown on panels C and D to simplify the figure.
When the difference between two groups is significant, the P value is indicated based on a two-tailed unpaired nonparametric Mann-Whitney test.

 and treatment had a better hematological response than the TB patients who did not
get the vitamin C supplement, suggesting a better prognosis, even though at the time,
none of the first-line TB drugs were available and treatment options were limited (16).
Although no radiological improvement in the disease was observed, the authors
concluded that the addition of vitamin C to TB treatment might improve patients’
resistance to infection.
Additional studies would also merit analysis of the natural resistance-associated
macrophage protein (Nramp) and vitamin C transporters alleles in TB patients. We had
previously shown that, in vitro, vitamin C activity was dependent on the iron concen-
tration present in the media. When a low concentration of ferric ion or when the iron
chelator deferoxamine was used, vitamin C had no activity in vitro (5). Nramp transports
iron and regulates iron levels within the phagosome of macrophages where M. tuber-
culosis resides (17). Human Nramp1 polymorphisms, which have been associated with
TB resistance (18), as well as polymorphisms found in the vitamin C transporters
encoded by SLC23A1 and SLC23A2 (19), may indicate that the host genotype could
impact the efficacy of vitamin C as an adjunct therapy. The addition of vitamin C to a
TB drug treatment regimen should be tested in TB patients to assess whether vitamin
C is a means to achieving faster sputum smear-negative conversion, which would
indicate a quicker reduction in mycobacterial burden. We therefore hypothesize that
the addition of vitamin C to TB chemotherapy might shorten TB treatment, leading to
a reduction in the incidences of both drug resistance development and disease relapse.
If this hypothesis is proven correct, vitamin C could improve TB chemotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains and reagents. The M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain used in this study was obtained
from laboratory stocks and was grown at 37°
C in Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Difco, Sparks, MD)
supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase (OADC) enrichment (Difco), 0.2%
(vol/vol) glycerol, and 0.05% (vol/vol) tyloxapol. Plating was done on Middlebrook 7H10 medium (Difco)
supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) OADC enrichment and 0.2% (vol/vol) glycerol. Plates were incubated
at 37°
C for four to 6 weeks. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was obtained from Corning cellgro
(Manassas, VA). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).
Mouse experiment. CBA/J female mice (6 to 8 weeks old) were obtained from Envigo (Indianapolis,
IN). The animal protocol no. 20150502 “Using vitamin C to augment TB chemotherapy in mouse model”
was approved by the Einstein Animal Institute, which is accredited by the American Association for the
Use of Laboratory Animals, and accepts as mandatory the NIH Principles for the Use of Animals. The M.
tuberculosis H37Rv culture was grown to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of �0.7, washed twice with
PBS, sonicated, and diluted in PBS prior to aerosol infection. The mice were infected with M. tuberculosis
H37Rv via the aerosol route. The mice were left to rest for 2 weeks before treatment was begun. Vitamin
C was dissolved in water, and the pH was adjusted to 7 with an aqueous solution of 10 M sodium
hydroxide. The vitamin C solution was given by i.p. injection at a concentration of 3 g/kg (1.7 M, 0.2 ml)
5 days a week for 4 weeks. Mice were given INH (100 mg/liter) and RIF (40 mg/liter) ad libitum in their
drinking water, which was changed twice a week. At specific times, mice were euthanized, and their
spleen and right lung were collected and homogenized in PBS. The organ lysates were then serially
diluted in PBS and plated on Middlebrook 7H10 plates (see media described above) to obtain the
number of CFU per organ.
Vitamin C quantification in serum. Blood was collected from the mice by retro-orbital bleeding and
dispensed in a microtube Z-gel. The microtubes were then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the
serum was removed from the tubes and stored at �20°
C until ready for use. The serum was mixed with
an equal volume of 0.56% metaphosphoric acid solution in water, vortexed for 30 s, and then centri-
fuged. The supernatant was collected and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
on a Hewlett-Packard model HP1100 gradient chromatograph equipped with an HP1100 series thermo-
stated column compartment, and an HP1100 series diode array detector. The data were collected and
processed with the HP ChemStation software. The column was a reverse-phase C18 column (4.6 by 150
mm; 3-mm column diameter; Alltima C18 [Alltech]) set at 50°
C. The wavelength was set at 254 nm. The
mobile phases were A, 0.5 mM KH2PO4 (pH 5.0); and B, isopropanol-acetonitrile (1/4 [vol/vol]). The
conditions used were 0 to 1.5 min, 5% B; 5 min, 15% B; 10 min, 90% B; and 15 min, 90% B. The flow
rate was set at 0.8 ml/min, and the injection volume was set at 80 �l. Standards of vitamin C were run
on the HPLC at different concentrations to obtain a calibration curve, allowing for vitamin C quantifi-
cation in the samples.
