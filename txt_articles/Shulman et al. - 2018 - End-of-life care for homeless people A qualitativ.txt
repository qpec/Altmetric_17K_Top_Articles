Abstract
Background: Being homeless or vulnerably housed is associated with death at a young age, frequently related to medical problems 
complicated by drug or alcohol dependence. Homeless people experience high symptom burden at the end of life, yet palliative care 
service use is limited.
Aim: To explore the views and experiences of current and formerly homeless people, frontline homelessness staff (from hostels, day 
centres and outreach teams) and health- and social-care providers, regarding challenges to supporting homeless people with advanced 
ill health, and to make suggestions for improving care.
Design: Thematic analysis of data collected using focus groups and interviews.
Participants: Single homeless people (n 
= 
28), formerly homeless people (n 
= 
10), health- and social-care providers (n 
= 
48), hostel 
staff (n 
= 
30) and outreach staff (n 
= 
10).
Results: This research documents growing concern that many homeless people are dying in unsupported, unacceptable situations. 
It highlights the complexities of identifying who is palliative and lack of appropriate places of care for people who are homeless with 
high support needs, particularly in combination with substance misuse issues.
Conclusion: Due to the lack of alternatives, homeless people with advanced ill health often remain in hostels. Conflict between the 
recovery-focused nature of many services and the realities of health and illness for often young homeless people result in a lack of 
person-centred care. Greater multidisciplinary working, extended in-reach into hostels from health and social services and training for 
all professional groups along with more access to appropriate supported accommodation are required to improve care for homeless 
people with advanced ill health.

Original Article
What is already known about the topic?
•
•
People who are homeless are often poorly engaged with the healthcare system, their health is often bad and death 
occurs at a young age.
•
•
Many homeless people experience tri-morbidity, a combination of physical and mental health problems and substance 
misuse.
•
•
Barriers to healthcare access for this group include perceived discrimination, zero-tolerance policies of facilities, unstable 
housing situations and inflexibility in existing services.

What this paper adds?
•
•
An insight into the lack of support and choices that many homeless people with advanced ill health receive.
•
•
Due to the lack of alternatives, homeless people with advanced ill health often remain in hostels as their health 
deteriorates.
•
•
Uncertainty around the prognoses of common illnesses, the impact of behaviours related to complex trauma and sub-
stance misuse and gaps and fragmentation in existing provision contribute to the difficulty in accessing and providing 
palliative care for this population.

•
Conflict between the recovery-focused nature of many services and the realities of health and illness for homeless 
people result in a lack of person-centred care for those with advanced ill health.
Implications for practice, theory or policy
•
•
If hostels are to continue to house people with chronic, deteriorating health conditions, far greater multidisciplinary 
in-reach, support and training are required.
•
•
Given that identifying which individuals may be approaching the end of their life is difficult, the trigger for action and 
support to be put in place could be when an individual’s health is causing concern, rather than when they are identified 
as dying.
•
•
A bespoke service, providing an appropriate level of care and support for homeless people who are dying, in an environ-
ment in which they can feel comfortable may be required.
Background
Homeless people encounter barriers in accessing health-
care services, experience poor health outcomes and early 
mortality.1,2 The mean age of death among single home-
less people ranges from 34 to 47 years, with age-adjusted 
death rates up to four times the housed population.1,3,4 
‘Homelessness’ includes people sleeping on the streets 
(rough sleeping) and in insecure or temporary accommo-
dation, including hostels.2 In 2016, on any given night, it 
was estimated that approximately 4134 people were 
sleeping on the streets (sleeping rough) across England. 
This figure is likely to be an underestimation and repre-
sents a 16% rise in the numbers observed in 2015 and 
more than double the amount in 2010.5
Homeless people’s health needs frequently include drug 
and/or alcohol dependence and mental health problems in 
association with physical health issues (tri-morbidity).6,7 A 
recent survey of healthcare usage of UK homeless people 
indicated many homeless people under-utilise primary care 
services while emergency health service usage is high.6,8 
This appears to be a pattern internationally.9
Challenges to accessing healthcare include navigating 
complicated healthcare systems,10 managing unstable 
housing situations, balancing competing priorities (such as 
food, shelter and addictions)11 and previous negative expe-
riences with healthcare services and professionals.12
Poorly managed addictions can make accessing health-
care within mainstream settings challenging due to fear of 
discrimination11 or medication delays leading to unpleas-
ant symptoms of withdrawal.11
Policies of zero tolerance towards illicit substances 
(such as crack and heroin) are common in many services, 
including care homes and hospital. Sobriety is often 
 
a requirement for engaging in health- and social-care 
assessments.12,13 In practical terms, these factors render 
many services inaccessible to this population.
The deaths of many homeless people are not planned 
for and occur following emergency admission to hospitals. 
Despite the high burden of disease and mortality in the 
homeless population,15 they have poor access to palliative 
care.16,17 Reasons for this may include the lack of positive 
interactions between homeless people and healthcare pro-
viders,18 challenges around alcohol and substance use17 
and methods and models of service delivery.19,20 Homeless 
people are less likely to have family members to advocate 
for them should their health deteriorate, thus the potential 
importance of advance care planning (ACP) for this group 
has been raised.21 ACP is a process of discussion about 
future healthcare wishes, usually in the context of antici-
pated health deterioration.22 ACP is a central aspect of pal-
liative care yet rarely occurs with homeless people.17 
Research indicates that homeless people may be willing to 
engage in ACP, yet varying degrees of success in engaging 
homeless people in this have been reported.21,23–26 Given 
the complexities in providing palliative care for homeless 
people, there is a need to hear the experiences and views of 
this group and the professionals supporting them regarding 
palliative care.
Aims
To explore the views and experiences of current and for-
merly homeless people, frontline homelessness staff (from 
hostels, day centres and outreach teams) and health- and 
social-care providers, regarding challenges to supporting 
homeless people with advanced ill health, and to make 
suggestions for improving care.

Methods
Participants and recruitment
Participants were recruited using opportunistic sampling 
across three London boroughs, selected for their high 
numbers of both homeless people and homelessness ser-
vices.27,28 Frontline homelessness staff and health- and 
social-care professionals were recruited through the 
research team’s existing professional connections and 
through mapping homelessness services within these 
boroughs.28
Formerly homeless people were recruited through 
homelessness charities: Pathway,29 Groundswell30 and St 
Mungo’s.31 Homeless people were identified and recruited 
by staff at homeless hostels and day centres.
Homeless hostels provide accommodation and support 
from key workers, while day centres provide support with 
basic needs such as food, clothing and washing facilities, 
but close at night. Current and formerly homeless partici-
pants were provided with a £10 supermarket voucher. 
Eligibility criteria are outlined in Table 1. We followed the 
consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative studies 
(COREQ) guidelines.32
Ethical considerations and informed consent
Formerly homeless people and other professionals experi-
enced in supporting homeless people were consulted 
regarding appropriate recruitment and data collection 
methodologies. This consultation resulted in amendments 
to the original recruitment strategy. Formerly homeless 
people felt it would be most appropriate for hostel and day 
centre staff to identify and invite potential participants, 
rather than using posters to advertise the research.
Ethical approval was obtained from the University 
College London research ethics committee (reference no. 
6927/001). Written consent was obtained from formerly 
homeless participants and staff, and verbal consent was 
obtained from homeless participants.
Data collection
Data were collected between October 2015 and October 
2016. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups enabled 
participants to use their own language and concepts to high-
light salient issues.33 Data collection with professionals was 
conducted at their place of work. Data collection with cur-
rently homeless people occurred at the hostels or day cen-
tres they were recruited from, while data collection with 
formerly homeless people took place at the offices of a char-
ity with which all were familiar. A vignette was used (Figure 
1) to keep discussions objective.10,34 The vignette provided a 
familiar scenario and had the potential to stimulate deep 
exploration of complex problems. Focus groups lasted for 
1 h with homeless people, health- and social-care providers 
and 3 h for all other groups. Participants completed demo-
graphic sheets to enable later analysis of the sample. Data 
collection was audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.
John is a 30-year-old man. He has been a heavy drinker 
since his early 20s. He was rough sleeping, squatting and 
sofa-surfing for a number of years and is currently in a 
hostel. He has had frequent attendances to hospital with 
alcohol-related fits, vomiting blood and has been diagnosed 
with liver cirrhosis. Three hospital attendances resulted in 
short admissions for detox. Following each admission, he 
started drinking again and missed follow-up appointments 
with hospital and community alcohol teams. The doctors 
have said that if he continues to drink, he is unlikely to live 
for more than 6–12 
months.

Analysis
Written summaries were circulated to participants to assess 
accuracy and validity. Thematic analysis35 was used to 
identify, analyse and report themes from the data. Line-by-
line coding was undertaken by B.F.H., and consensus was 
achieved through discussion (B.F.H. and C.S.). Higher 
level candidate themes and subthemes (Table 3) were 
developed and discussed with a wider group of healthcare 
professionals, researchers and formerly homeless people.
Results
Participants
A total of 127 participants took part in a total of 28 focus 
groups and 10 individual semi-structured interviews. 
Participants’ characteristics are outlined in Table 2. Over 
one-third (n = 39%) of homeless participants had been 
homeless for more than 5 years, 86% reported having slept

Challenges in the provision of palliative care for 
homeless people in London
Semi-structured interviews and focus groups identified 
challenges in providing palliative care to homeless peo-
ple. Challenges included supporting people with com-
plex trauma and substance misuse in mainstream 
services, uncertainty around prognosis and complexity 
associated with homelessness. Gaps and fragmentation 
in existing systems meant there was often very little 
choice regarding place of care for homeless people 
(Tables 3 and 4).
Complex behaviours in mainstream health and 
social services
Behaviours related to complex trauma and substance misuse; 
inflexibility and inexperience. Health and social services have 
difficulty supporting the complicated requirements of some 
homeless people due to their often chaotic lifestyles and 
addictions. During hospital admissions, it was common for 
addiction-driven behaviours to cause homeless people to 
Table 4. Key findings.
Key findings
•
•
In London, appropriate services for homeless people with 
advanced ill health are lacking. Facilities that can meet the 
physical and emotional needs of homeless people with 
advanced ill health, who may continue to misuse substances, 
are needed.
•
•
There is currently a large emotional, and practical burden 
on hostel staff in supporting homeless people with advanced 
ill health due to lack of appropriate alternatives. Homeless 
people, and those supporting them, struggle to access the 
services required.
•
•
There is a conflict between the recovery-focused nature 
of many services, and the realities of health and illness 
for homeless people that create a lack of comprehensive 
person-centred care.
•
•
Collaboration between health, housing and social services, 
the promotion of multidisciplinary working including hostel 
in-reach and greater training and support are urgently 
needed for professionals and those working with homeless 
people as their health deteriorates.
frequently leave the ward to obtain substances or alcohol. 
This made it difficult for already stretched hospital staff to 
engage with the person and deliver the care required:
… one problem is that hospitals are so busy … if someone is 
repeatedly coming back in, full of ascitic fluid, popping off 
the ward for a couple of cans, they just discharge them … But 
… if that’s going to be the pattern for the last 6 months of 
someone’s life, you want to try and actually use it. (General 
Practitioner – Borough A)
Furthermore, homeless people were avoidant of many 
mainstream facilities, which seemed alien to them. A pref-
erence to remain in the familiar environment of the hostel 
was described:
There’s been a few guys that were in hospital, told they were 
dying … they didn’t want to go to any hospice, they didn’t 
 Shulman et al. 
41
want to … stay in hospital, they wanted to die in the homeless 
hostel. (Formerly homeless person – Borough B)
The inexperience of many professionals alongside the 
difficulties of working with people with challenging 
behaviours in mainstream settings was sometimes trans-
lated into a perceived prejudice and lack of compassion 
towards homeless people:
I think there’s a stigma … and professionals see it as a 
choice, you choose to pick the can up and put it to your 
mouth, rather than you being mentally and physically sick 
… So they just think ‘You’re wasting our time, you didn’t 
have to pick up that drink’, but there’s so much more behind 
it than just picking up the drink. (Formerly homeless person 
– Borough B)
This complexity negatively affected the way that home-
less people were able to access services, meaning assess-
ments and the delivery of services were challenged:
Social services say ‘they’re still drinking, so we’re not going 
to give them a package of care’. Even if they’re drinking, they 
still need to get in and out of a bath, or use a commode. Their 
drinking doesn’t mean they’re not entitled to services. (Drug 
and alcohol worker – Borough B)
Gaps in existing systems
Lack of alternatives. Homeless people often present with 
high support needs with advanced ill health and/or cogni-
tive impairment at a young age (young olds).36 The lack of 
facilities providing palliative care, including respite and a 
place to die in comfort, were the most significant gaps 
described.
Homeless people do not fit the profile of the majority of 
care home patients where one of the admission criteria is 
usually to be over 65 years of age. Behaviours associated 
with substance misuse also pose a challenge for hospices 
and care homes, where many residents are frail and vulner-
able. Thus, access to these services is uncommon for this 
population:
Most care homes are with people with dementia who are 
older; it’s just, it’s our patients just don’t fit any of these like 
rigid things … the care homes themselves are like ‘what?! 
‘We don’t want this 29 year old’ … you know? (Specialist 
nurse – Borough C)
Need for holistic approach to care and support. Frustration 
was expressed regarding the fragmentation and lack of 
joint approach between health, housing and social services 
which prevented a person-centred approach to care. 
Assessments by social services only took the individual’s 
current situation into account. They were often conducted 
in hospitals, following detox from alcohol (or stabilisation 
on methadone), were often inaccurate and did not 
represent that person’s needs back in the community. 
When support from social services was obtained, it was 
often inadequate. Concerns from hostel staff were often 
not listened to by professionals and a lack of continuity in 
carers meant trust did not develop between the carer and 
the homeless person:
They are not incontinent 11 o’clock every day when the carer 
comes in. It’s like … when somebody is dying … they are not 
dying between the hours of 9 to 5. It could happen anytime so 
you know … who does the nights? We do. Their physical 
health needs are so extensive. So … having these [carers] 
coming in and out. It’s just … it doesn’t work. (Hostel staff – 
Borough C)
Hostel as a place of care and death? In London, many 
homeless people with high support needs are in home-
less hostels, usually for up to 2 years. The hostels 
included in this research all provide single rooms with 
shared facilities and an assigned key worker. Overall, 
key workers focus on recovery; helping people transition 
to less supported accommodation, moving towards 
abstinence, stability and employment. For some, this 
 
is appropriate, but for those with advanced illness, 
 
this raises issues. Shifting the focus of support and 
 
services away from recovery towards living well until 
death (by focusing on improving quality of life) may be 
uncomfortable, despite recognition that ‘recovery’ may 
not be possible for all:
When I first came into this I thought this is about recovery, it’s 
not. I mean … realistically … it can’t be. And it isn’t. Very 
few people recover. (Specialist nurse – Borough C)
Where the focus of support and interactions between 
professionals and homeless individuals changed from 
an aim to reduce or stop substances, to an improve-
ment in quality of life, care was person-centred and 
compassionate:
He was very content. I think because we allowed him to have 
his wish [not to go into hospital] … He didn’t want any 
medication from the GP … he wanted to carry on drinking … 
we respected his wish … It was very sad for us, but … it was 
what he wanted. (Outreach worker – Borough B)
Debate emerged over whether homeless people should, 
if they wished, be supported to remain in hostels until they 
die. Concerns raised included limited access to adequate 
support, lack of staff confidence, burden on staff, safe-
guarding concerns and the chaotic, noisy nature of hostels. 
The quote below describes fear around the vulnerability of 
homeless people with advanced ill health who remain 
within the hostel:
They become so vulnerable to financial exploitation …, they 
used to take him to the cash machine and take all his money 
 42 
Palliative Medicine 32(1)
… we couldn’t safeguard against that … he was deemed to 
have capacity; we couldn’t do a damned thing about his 
money. (Hostel staff – Borough C)
Storing and administering medication within a hostel 
was also problematic. Hostel staff are not trained or 
licensed to administer medication. In an environment in 
which many residents have substance misuse issues, the 
safe storage of medications such as opiates is an issue.
Furthermore, some participants felt dying in a hostel 
may be an isolated, unpleasant experience that could be 
disturbing for other residents:
You’ve got to walk past those people [who are visibly unwell]. 
They half block the stairwell, you have to edge your way past. 
It’s kind of … in your face. Erm, yeah, it becomes part of the 
furniture. But it disturbs me as a person … (Hostel resident – 
Borough C)
The burdens of caring for dying homeless people fall on 
hostel staff, despite often having no medical training or 
experience. Many participants emphasised that hostels are 
not, and perhaps should not become care homes. While 
hostel staff did all they could to support dying residents, 
this was a very difficult position for them, emotionally and 
logistically:
At least three times a shift we check she’s okay. It’s hard … 
particularly on weekends and nights when we only have two 
staff … it’s a big hostel [60 residents] … you really can only 
do so much … this isn’t an appropriate environment, but it’s 
the best we have. (Hostel staff – Borough A)
With the focus of palliative care being quality of life, for 
some, the benefits of enabling dying persons to remain in 
hostels outweighed the challenges. Arguments for people 
remaining in the hostel centred around choice and compas-
sion. Some hostel residents perceived the hostel as ‘home’. 
As such, if a desire to remain there until death was expressed, 
some felt this should be honoured. While hospitals may bet-
ter serve the physical needs of dying homeless people, some 
felt hostels were best placed to meet their emotional needs. 
Furthermore, hospitals were often thought of as ‘places of 
death’ by homeless people and were thus avoided:
I remember one guy … his breath, you’d smell it, you’d know 
he was ill. And I used to say to him, get help … get to hospital 
… he just was absolutely terrified of hospitals. He’d say ‘if I 
go into hospital, I’m coming out in a box’. (Day centre user 
– Borough B)
Uncertainty and complexity
Difficulty predicting disease trajectories. The surprise ques-
tion (‘Would you be surprised if this person were to die in 
the next 6–12 months?’) is a method used when consider-
ing whether someone may benefit from palliative care.37 
Hostel staff and healthcare professionals indicated that for 
many homeless people, the answer to this question would 
be ‘no’. Their health is often poor, and their needs are 
complex making it hard to identify who might be consid-
ered palliative.
Further uncertainty stems from characteristics of ill-
nesses such as decompensated liver disease (often a com-
plication of alcohol and/or hepatitis C), common among 
the homeless population. Prognosis for these illnesses is 
notoriously difficult to predict, particularly in the context 
of continuing substance misuse:38
One of my clients was given three months, he didn’t die for 
about a year and four months later, that’s liver disease, yeah. 
And there’s another guy … he should be dead by now. He 
looks weller every day! (Hostel staff – Borough C)
For illnesses such as cancer, with more predictable tra-
jectories, professionals reported more success in accessing 
services including hospice support. However, even for 
homeless cancer patients who were not misusing sub-
stances, placement within a care home or hospice remained 
challenging, due to young age and previous experiences 
that hospices had with supporting homeless people:
The last time I tried to get a [homeless] patient a bed at a 
hospice, they [the hospice] interrogated me. They wanted a 
very clear prognosis and it was because the woman I had sent 
there before, who we thought was dying … was there for 
months because she had nowhere else to go. (Hospital 
palliative care nurse specialist – Borough B)
Advance Care Planning. ACP [or discussions regarding 
goals of care] rarely occurred with our group of homeless 
individuals. In addition to a lack of options to offer, profes-
sionals often lacked confidence in having such conversa-
tions and expressed concerns regarding the fragility and 
vulnerability of many homeless people:
… we have a client who … probably … could die within the 
next 6-12 months … do we want to have a conversation about 
where he wants to die? I feel I can’t because I don’t feel there 
are any options for him. (Hostel staff – Borough C)
Many homeless people are using substances to block 
out past trauma, so the potential of negatively impacting 
on their emotional well-being by discussing future health 
and options was voiced as a major concern. Other profes-
sionals feared discussions about future care needs and 
preferences may represent removal of hope and be inter-
preted as staff ‘giving up on them’. Transient relationships 
were often cited by medical staff as conversation barriers:
For people who aren’t engaging … Self-discharging … 
nobody feels they know them … having those very difficult 
conversations … people feel someone else should be doing it 
… no one feels qualified … (Nurse – Borough C)
 Shulman et al. 
43
Avoidance of discussing future preferences was echoed 
by homeless people:
A lot of people are frightened to think about it. Most people 
won’t talk about it, they won’t entertain talking about it. They 
see it as so far away, you know? Why bother now, let’s wait 
until nearer the time. (Hostel resident – Borough C)
The combination of apprehension from professionals 
and avoidance from homeless people challenged the 
exploration of future wishes and preferences:
I think the temptation is just not to have the conversation, you 
know it’s happening, they know it’s happening … especially 
when admissions become more frequent … staff know eventually 
that person’s not coming back. (Hostel staff – Borough A)
Discussion
This is the largest qualitative study exploring challenges to 
palliative care for homeless people, from the perspectives 
of homeless people and those supporting them. This 
research documents the growing concern that many home-
less people are dying in unsupported, unacceptable situa-
tions. Complexities of identifying who is palliative and 
also the lack of appropriate services for homeless people 
who have high support needs, particularly in combination 
with substance misuse issues, are highlighted.
Our findings indicate that complexity around caring for 
homeless people with advanced ill health stems in part 
from difficulties accepting young people are dying from 
potentially preventable causes. The conflict between the 
recovery-focused nature of many services and the realities 
of health and illness for homeless people create blocks to 
truly person-centred care.
Implications for policy and practice
Tailored, joined-up services. The importance of individual-
ised care for homeless people21 in a psychologically 
informed environment39 has been recognised. However, 
the current fragmentation in services and funding across 
London means this can be challenging to deliver, with 
access to appropriate services proving problematic.
Providing adequate support for homeless people as 
their health deteriorates is complicated and requires an 
integrated approach between health, housing and social 
care. In the United Kingdom, a facility that is tailored to 
the needs of this population that could provide respite,40 
act as a step-up from a hostel and a step-down from hospi-
tal and which could also be a place someone could peace-
fully die is required. This model is in operation in Canada 
in the form of a ‘shelter based hospice’.41
Promoting in-reach, collaboration and training. If homeless 
people with advanced ill health are to remain in hostels, 
greater collaboration between health- and social-care ser-
vices is needed. This could improve care for homeless 
people with advanced ill health and support and reduce 
pressure on hostel staff. Participants emphasised the need 
for multidisciplinary case reviews, in-reach into hostels 
and greater training and support for all professional 
groups. Where there was in-reach from nurses and gen-
eral practitioners into hostels, this was found to be inval-
uable. Also of great benefit was the palliative care 
coordinator role, operational in St Mungo’s hostels (a 
homelessness charity).19 This provides an interface 
between hostels and healthcare providers and encourages 
multidisciplinary working. Extension of this and other 
in-reach roles should be encouraged, alongside building 
on the growing interest from the hospice community in 
supporting homeless people.
ACP. Conversations with homeless people regarding their 
future care preferences rarely occur partly due to uncer-
tainty of prognoses, concerns about fragility and the focus 
on recovery inherent in the ethos of many services. To 
combat these, we propose that conversations start earlier 
and the focus of such discussions should help people 
explore their insights, aspirations, health and choices for 
the future, and not just end-of-life issues.
Strengths and limitations. While the experiences of home-
less people in London may be different to those in rural 
areas, we believe many of the challenges described may 
be encountered outside London. A large, diverse sample 
was recruited, though self-selection of professional par-
ticipants and key worker identification of homeless par-
ticipants introduces the potential for bias. The requirement 
for homeless people to be sober during participation may 
have led to an underrepresentation of those with severe 
addictions. Twenty-five percent of our homeless sample 
reported using drugs, which is lower than previous UK 
research suggests.6
Implications for future research. Significant gaps in services 
for homeless people with advanced ill health have been 
identified. Research is needed to quantify the scale of this 
problem and interventions, using qualitative and quantita-
tive methods, need to be developed and evaluated to 
address this inequity. Training for all professional groups 
needs to developed, delivered and evaluated.
Conclusion
Given the unique and complex needs of homeless people 
with advanced ill health, specialised, flexible services are 
key in promoting compassionate, coordinated care. This 
will require a joint response from health, housing and 
social services. At the minimum, this should include 
increased collaboration between services, the promotion

of in-reach into hostels and greater training and support for 
all professional groups. A bespoke service, providing an 
appropriate level of care and support for homeless people 
who are dying, in an environment in which they can feel 
comfortable may also be required.
