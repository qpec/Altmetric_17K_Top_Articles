Abstract
An epidemiological paradox surrounds Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis. In high-income 
settings, it has been responsible for an epidemic of poultry-associated, self-limiting enterocolitis, 
whilst in sub-Saharan Africa it is a major cause of invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella disease, 
associated with high case-fatality. Whole-genome sequence analysis of 675 isolates of S.

 Enteritidis from 45 countries reveals the existence of a global epidemic clade and two novel clades 
of S. Enteritidis that are each geographically restricted to distinct regions of Africa. The African 
isolates display genomic degradation, a novel prophage repertoire and have an expanded, 
multidrug resistance plasmid. S. Enteritidis is a further example of a Salmonella serotype that 
displays niche plasticity, with distinct clades that enable it to become a prominent cause of 
gastroenteritis in association with the industrial production of eggs, and of multidrug resistant, 
bloodstream invasive infection in Africa.

Introduction
Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (hereafter referred to as S. Enteritidis) has been a 
global cause of major epidemics of enterocolitis, which have been strongly associated with 
intensive poultry farming and egg production1. The serovar is usually considered to be a 
generalist in terms of host range and has a low human invasiveness index, typically causing 
self-limiting enterocolitis2. Following a number of interventions in the farming industry 
involving both improved hygiene and poultry vaccination, epidemic S. Enteritidis has been 
in decline in many countries including the United Kingdom and USA3,4. S. Enteritidis has 
also been used extensively since the early 1900s as a rodenticide (named the “Danysz 
virus”), following development at Institut Pasteur, France. Although by the 1960s, 
Salmonella-based rodenticides had been banned in the US, Germany and the UK, S. 
Enteritidis is still produced as a rodenticide in Cuba, under the name Biorat®5.
Serovars of Salmonella that cause enterocolitis in industrialised settings are strongly 
associated with life-threatening invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella (iNTS) disease in sub-
Saharan Africa (SSA). S. Enteritidis and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. 
Typhimurium) are the two leading causes of iNTS disease in SSA6 and both are associated 
with multidrug resistance (MDR)7. The clinical syndrome iNTS disease is associated with 
immunosuppression in the human host, particularly malnutrition, severe malaria and 
advanced HIV in young children and advanced HIV in adults8. It has been estimated to 
cause 681,000 deaths per year9.
Salmonella is a key example of a bacterial genus in which there is a recognizable genomic 
signature that distinguishes between a gastrointestinal and an extra-intestinal/invasive 
lifestyle10, whereby functions required for escalating growth in an inflamed gut are lost 
when the lineage becomes invasive11. In order to investigate whether there were distinct 
bacterial characteristics explaining the very different epidemiological and clinical profile of 
epidemic isolates of serotype S. Typhimurium from SSA and industrialised settings, whole-
genome sequence (WGS) investigations of this serovar were previously undertaken. These 
revealed a novel pathotype of multilocus sequence type (MLST) ST313 from SSA, which 
differed from clades that cause enterocolitis in industrialised settings, by showing patterns of

 genomic degradation potentially associated with more invasive disease and differential host 
adaptation12–17.
In relation to S. Enteritidis, there is a growing body of literature on the evolutionary history, 
phylogeny and utility of WGS for surveillance of S. Enteritidis outbreaks18–20. The 
broadest study of the phylogeny to date revealed five major lineages, but contained only two 
African isolates21. There have also been limited reports of isolates of S. Enteritidis from 
African patients living in Europe that are MDR and which display a distinct phage type (PT 
42)22,23. We therefore hypothesized that there are distinct lineages of S. Enteritidis 
circulating in both the industrialised and developing world with different origins, likely 
distinct routes of spread and that are associated with different patterns of disease, which will 
display the distinct genomic signatures characteristic of differential adaptation. To 
investigate this we have collected a highly diverse global collection of S. Enteritidis isolates 
and compared them using whole-genome sequencing, the highest possible resolution typing 
methodology.
Results
Isolate collection
In total, 675 isolates of S. Enteritidis isolated between 1948 and 2013 were sequenced. The 
collection originated from 45 countries and six continents (Table 1). 496/675 isolates were 
from Africa, with 131 from the Republic of South Africa (RSA), a further 353 from the rest 
of SSA, and 12 from North Africa (Table 1). There were 343 isolates from normally sterile 
human sites (invasive), 124 non-invasive human isolates (predominantly stool samples) and 
40 from animal, food or environmental sources. The full metadata are described in 
Supplementary Table 1 and have been uploaded to the publically available database 
Enterobase.
Phylogeny
675 S. Enteritidis genomes and one Salmonella enterica serovar Gallinarum were mapped to 
the S. Enteritidis strain P125109 reference sequence, variable regions excluded and the 
remaining sites were screened for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This left an 
alignment containing a total of 42,373 variable sites, from which a maximum likelihood 
(ML)-phylogeny was constructed using S. Gallinarum, which is a closely related serovar, as 
an out-group (Figure 1). HierBAPS was run over two rounds, which provided clear 
distinction between clades/clusters24. The phylogeny of S. Enteritidis revealed evidence of 
three clades associated with epidemics, one which we have termed the ‘global epidemic 
clade’ and includes the reference PT4 isolate P125109 and two African clades: one 
predominantly composed of West African isolates (labeled the ‘West African clade’) and a 
second composed of isolates predominantly originating in Central and Eastern Africa, called 
the ‘Central/Eastern African clade’). Figure 1 also shows the other clades and clusters 
predicted by HierBAPS, the largest of which is a paraphyletic cluster from which the global 
epidemic clade emerged (Outlier Cluster in Figure 1), and a further five smaller clades or 
clusters predicted by HierBAPS.

 The global epidemic clade contains isolates of multiple phage types, including 4 and 1, 
which have been linked to the global epidemic of poultry associated human enterocolitis25. 
It comprised 250 isolates from 28 countries, including 43 from Malawi and 82 from RSA. 
They were isolated from across a 63-year period (1948-2013). Antimicrobial susceptibility 
testing had been performed on 144 isolates and 104 were susceptible to all antimicrobials 
tested, five were multidrug resistant (MDR: resistant to 3 or more antimicrobial classes), one 
was nalidixic acid resistant and none were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-
producing isolates. Database comparison of the genomes from this clade revealed that 221 
(88%) of them contained no predicted antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes apart from the 
cryptic resistance gene aac(6')-Iy26.
The global epidemic clade has emerged from a diverse cluster previously described by 
Zheng27, which encompassed 131 isolates (Figure 1: ‘Outlier Cluster’). In addition to being 
paraphyletic, this group was geographically and temporally diverse, and predominantly drug 
susceptible (59/71 isolates). Whilst the majority of the diversity of phage typed isolates was 
contained within the global epidemic clade, this cluster alone contained isolates of phage 
type 14b, which was recently associated with a multi-country outbreak of S. Enteritidis 
enterocolitis in Europe associated with chicken eggs from Germany28. There were also 41 
isolates from RSA in this clade, where it has been a common cause of bloodstream infection, 
and 39 bloodstream isolates from Malawi. Database comparison of the genomes from this 
clade revealed that 122 (82%) of these genomes contained no predicted AMR genes apart 
from the cryptic resistance gene aac(6')-Iy.
There were two related, but phylogenetically and geographically distinct, epidemic clades 
that largely originated from SSA. The Central/Eastern African clade included 166 isolates, 
all but two of which (from RSA) came from this region. Of these, 126/155 (82%) were 
MDR and 148/153 (97%) displayed phenotypic resistance to between one and four 
antimicrobial classes. All of these genomes contained at least five predicted resistance genes 
and 128 (77%) contained nine (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 2). 155/165 (94%) of these 
isolates were cultured from a normally sterile compartment of a human (i.e. blood or 
cerebrospinal fluid) and were considered to be causing invasive disease (Table 2). The 
second African epidemic clade was significantly associated with West Africa with 65/66 
isolates coming from this region and one isolate from USA. This clade was also associated 
with drug resistance (62 [94%] resistant to ≥1 antimicrobial class by phenotype and 
genotype) and human invasive disease (61 [92%]). It also included two isolates that were 
subtyped as phage type 4.
The remaining 58 isolates included in this study were extremely diverse, phylogenetically, 
temporally and geographically. Only two displayed any phenotypic AMR, one of which was 
MDR. Inspection of the genome revealed that five had predicted AMR genes in addition to 
aac(6')-Iy, four of which were isolated in sub-Saharan Africa. Twenty were associated with 
invasive human disease, and six were recovered from stool. Three isolates were from stocks 
of rodenticide and these were phylogenetically remote from both global-epidemic and the 
two African epidemic clades.

 To add further context to these findings we screened the entire publically available Public 
Health England (PHE) sequenced Salmonella routine surveillance collection, which includes 
2,986 S. Enteritidis genomes, 265 of which were associated with travel to Africa 
(Supplementary Figure 1). Within this huge collection, including 61 (2.0%) bloodstream 
isolates and 2670 (89.4%) stool isolates, only 6 isolates (4 from blood culture, 1 from stool) 
fell within to the West African clade and 1 (from stool) belonged to the Central/Eastern 
African clade. Notably, these isolates were all either associated with travel to Africa and/or 
taken from patients of African origin.
It is apparent from the location of the archetypal reference isolate and archetypal phage 
types in the phylogeny (Supplementary Figure 2) that the majority of S. Enteritidis studied 
previously belonged to the global epidemic clade associated with enterocolitis in 
industrialised countries. Furthermore, its also clear that two additional, previously 
unrecognized S. Enteritidis lineages have emerged, largely restricted to Africa, that are 
strongly associated with MDR and invasive disease.
To understand how recently these Africa-associated lineages emerged we used Bayesian 
Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees (BEAST) to reconstruct the temporal history of 
the epidemic clades29. These data (Supplementary Figure 3) estimate the most recent 
common ancestor (MRCA) of the Central/Eastern African clade dates to 1945 (95% 
Credible Interval [CrI]: 1924-1951) and for the West African clade it was 1933 (95% CrI: 
1901-1956). We estimate the MRCA of the global epidemic clade originated around 1918 
(95% CrI: 1879-1942 – Supplementary Figure 4), with a modern expansion occurring in 
1976 (95% CrI: 1968-1983), whereas the paraphyletic cluster from which it emerged dates 
to approximately 1711 (95% CrI: 1420-1868).
Contribution of the accessory genome
Prophages have the potential to carry non-essential "cargo" genes, which suggests they 
confer a level of specialization to their host bacterial species, whilst plasmids may confer a 
diverse array of virulence factors and AMR 30,31. Therefore it is critical to evaluate the 
accessory genome in parallel with the core. 622 sequenced genomes were used to determine 
a pangenome, which yielded a core genome comprising 4,076 predicted genes present in 
≥90% isolates, including all 12 recognised Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands as well as all 13 
fimbrial operons found in the P125109 reference32. The core gene definition was set to 
minimize stochastic loss of genes from the core due to errors in individual assemblies across 
such a large dataset. The accessory genome consisted of 14,015 predicted genes. Of the 
accessory genes, 324 were highly conserved across the global and two African epidemic 
clades, as well as the outlier cluster. Almost all were associated with the acquisition or loss 
of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) such as prophage or plasmids. Prophage regions have 
been shown to be stable in Salmonella genomes and are potential molecular markers, the 
presence of which has previously been used to distinguish specific clades13,33.
The lineage-specific whole gene differences of the major clades are summarized in Figure 2 
and plotted against the representatives of the four major clades in Supplementary Figure 5. 
The lineage specific sequence regions include 57 predicted genes found to be unique to the 
global epidemic clade (Figure 2), all of which were associated with prophage ΦSE20, a

 region shown to be essential for invasion of chicken ova and mice in one previous study34. 
There were a further 39 genes conserved in the global epidemic and the paraphyletic 
outlying cluster, which were absent from both African clades, 26 of which correspond to 
region of difference (ROD) 2132. The Central/Eastern Africa clade contained 77 predicted 
genes that were absent in the other clades. 33 were associated with the virulence plasmid 
and a further 40 chromosomal genes were associated with a novel, Fels-2 like prophage 
region (ϕfels-BT). The West African clade had only 15 distinct predicted genes, 11 of which 
were plasmid-associated. The two African clades shared a further 102 genes: 48, including a 
leucine-rich repeat region, were associated with a novel prophage region closely related to 
Enterobacter phage P88, 44 were associated with a Gifsy-1 prophage found in S. 
Bovismorbificans and eight were associated with a Gifsy-2 prophage which has degenerated 
in the reference P125109.
The S. Enteritidis plasmid is the smallest of the generic Salmonella virulence plasmids at 58 
kb and is unusual in that it contains an incomplete set of tra genes that are responsible for 
conjugative gene transfer. The phylogeny of the S. Enteritidis virulence plasmid backbone 
was reconstructed using reads that mapped to the S. Enteritidis reference virulence plasmid, 
pSENV. 120/675 (18%) genomes lacked pSENV. The virulence plasmid phylogeny is 
similar to that of the chromosome, suggesting that they have been stably maintained by each 
lineage and diversified alongside them (Supplementary Figure 6).
The virulence plasmids from the African clades were much larger than those held in the 
other clades at ~90 kb. A representative example was extracted from Malawian isolate 
D7795, sequenced using long read technology to accurately reconstruct it (PacBio; see 
methods) and denoted pSEN-BT (Accession number LN879484). pSEN-BT is composed of 
a backbone of pSENV with additional regions that are highly similar to recently sequenced 
fragments of an novel S. Enteritidis virulence plasmid (pUO-SeVR) isolated from an 
African patient presenting with MDR invasive S. Enteritidis in Spain22. Plasmid pSEN-BT 
harbours nine AMR genes (full list in Supplementary Table 2), plus additional genes 
associated with virulence and a toxin/antitoxin plasmid addiction system. Of note, plasmids 
from the West African isolates carry resistance gene chloramphenicol acetyl transferase A1 
(catA1), whereas the Central/Eastern African strains carry catA2 and tetracycline resistance 
gene tet(A). Like pSENV, the African virulence plasmid contained an incomplete set of tra 
genes and so is not self-transmissible. This was confirmed by conjugation experiments and 
is consistent with previous reports22,23. These observations suggest that the evolution of the 
S. Enteritidis plasmid mirrors that of the chromosome; it is thus not a ‘novel’ plasmid, but in 
different SSA locations has acquired different AMR genes.
Multiple signatures of differential host adaptation
It has been observed in multiple serovars of Salmonella including S. Typhi, S. Gallinarum 
and S. Typhimurium ST313 that the degradation of genes necessary for the utilization of 
inflammation-derived nutrients is a marker of that lineage having moved from an intestinal 
to a more invasive lifestyle13,14,32,35. Accordingly, we have looked for similar evidence 
within a representative example of a MDR, invasive, Central/Eastern African clade isolate, 
D7795, that was isolated from the blood of a Malawian child in 2000. The draft genome

 sequence of D7795 closely resembles that of P125109, however, in addition to the novel 
prophage repertoire and plasmid genes described above, it harbours a number of predicted 
pseudogenes or hypothetically disrupted genes (HDGs)11.
In total, there were 42 putative HDGs in D7795, many of which are found in genes involved 
in gut colonisation and fecal shedding as well as various metabolic processes such as 
cobalamine biosynthesis which is a cofactor for anaerobic catabolism of inflammation-
derived nutrients, such as ethanolamine, following infection36. Curation of the SNPs and 
insertions or deletions (indels) predicted to be responsible for pseudogenisation across the 
Central/Eastern African clade and West African clade revealed 37/42 predicted HDGs were 
fixed in other representatives of the Central/East African clade, with 27 of them being 
present in over 90% of isolates from that clade. Relatively fewer HDGs in D7795 (19/42) 
were present in representatives of the West African clade, although 13 were present in ≥90% 
of isolates (Supplementary Table 3).
In addition to this evidence of reductive evolution in D7795, there were 363 genes 
containing non-synonymous (NS)-SNPs, which change the amino acid sequence and so may 
have functional consequences37. The two African clades were screened for the presence of 
these NS-SNPs and 131 were found to be present and completely conserved across both 
clades, including NS-SNPs in 43 genes encoding predicted membrane proteins, 36 metabolic 
genes and 23 conserved hypothetical genes (Supplementary Table 4). Furthermore many of 
these NS-SNPs fall in genes within the same metabolic pathways as the HDGs (see 
Supplementary Note for detailed description). Supplementary Table 5 provides a list of some 
of the common traits identified amongst the functions of genes lost independently by D7795, 
S. Typhi and S. Gallinarum. The disproportionate clustering of mutations in membrane 
structures observed in the African clades is yet another sign of differential host adaptation 
analogous to that reported in both S. Typhi35 and S. Gallinarum32.
Biolog™ growth substrate platform profiling
The Biolog™ platform was utilized to generate a substrate growth utilisation profile for 
selected S. Enteritidis isolates. Corresponding signal values of replicate pairs of a Central/
Eastern African isolate (D7795) and a global epidemic isolate (A1636) were compared using 
principal component analysis and found to be highly consistent. In total, 80 metabolites 
showed evidence of differential metabolic activity (Figure 3). Evaluation of data from the 
Central/Eastern African isolate using Pathway Tools software revealed that 14/27 (52%) of 
pathways with evidence of decreased metabolic activity at 28°C had a corresponding 
component of genomic degradation. This was also true for 12/30 (40%) of pathways with 
evidence of decreased metabolic activity at 37°C.
Instances of reduced metabolic activity in a Central/Eastern African strain (D7795) 
compared to a global epidemic strain (A1636) included dulcitol and glycolic acid in the 
glycerol degradation pathway, propionic acid in the propanediol pathway and ethylamine 
and ethanolamine. These are all vitamin B12 (cobalamin) dependent reactions, for which 
there was a corresponding signature of genomic degradation. Also there was reduced activity 
in response to three forms of butyric acid, alloxan and allantoic acid metabolism. Allantoin 
can be found in the serum of birds, but not humans and is utilised as a carbon source during 
Feasey et al.

 S. Enteritidis infection of chickens38, and HDGs relating to allantoin have been noted in S. 
Typhimurium ST31313. The full list of differences is detailed in Supplementary Table 6 and 
7. This is a further sign of decreased metabolism of the Central/Eastern African isolate in the 
anaerobic environment of the gut.
Chick infection model suggests divide in host range
Given the phenotypic differences observed in the genotypically distinct global and African 
clades, we hypothesized that these lineages could have differing infection phenotypes in an 
in vivo challenge model. We compared the infection profile of a member of the Central/
Eastern African clade (D7795) to the reference global epidemic strain P125109 in an avian 
host. The chicken group infected with P125109 showed mild hepatosplenomegaly consistent 
with infection by this Salmonella serovar and cecal colonization (Figure 4A-C). In contrast, 
the Central/Eastern African strain displayed significantly reduced invasion at 7 dpi of both 
liver (p=0.027) and spleen (p=0.007), however cecal colonization was not significantly 
reduced (p=0.160). This is in marked contrast to the behavior of S. Typhimurium ST313, 
which is more invasive in a chick infection model12.
Discussion
S. Enteritidis is an example of a successful Salmonella lineage with the apparent ability to 
adapt to different hosts and transmission niches as and when opportunities for specialization 
have presented. Langridge et al recently evaluated the Enteritidis/Gallinarum/Dublin lineage 
of Salmonella, revealing components of the nature and order of events associated with host-
range and restriction39. In the present study, we have highlighted the plasticity of S. 
Enteritidis, providing evidence of three distinct epidemics of human disease. In addition we 
show multiple additional clades and clusters that demonstrate the huge reservoir of diversity 
amongst S. Enteritidis from which future epidemics might emerge.
An important question posed by this study is why have distinct clades of Salmonella 
emerged to become prominent causes of iNTS disease in Africa, from a serotype normally 
considered to be weakly invasive? The presence of a highly immunosuppressed population 
due to the HIV pandemic is clearly a key host factor that facilitates the clinical syndrome 
iNTS disease40,41. In addition to human host factors, there are two distinct African 
epidemic lineages that have emerged in the last 90 years. Both lineages are significantly 
associated with a novel prophage repertoire, an expanded, MDR-augmented virulence 
plasmid, and patterns of genomic degradation with similarity to other host-restricted invasive 
Salmonella serotypes including S. Typhi and S. Gallinarum and to clades of S. Typhimurium 
associated with invasive disease in Africa13,32,35. This pattern of genomic degradation is 
concentrated in pathways specifically associated with an enteric lifestyle, however it is 
noteworthy that in the chick infection model, the African S. Enteritidis invaded the chick 
liver and spleen less well than the global pandemic clade. This raises the possibility that the 
two clades occupy different ecological niches outside the human host or that they behave 
differently within the human host and screening of the huge S. Enteritidis collection from 
routine Salmonella surveillance by PHE supports the assertion that these lineages are 
geographically restricted to Africa. This study therefore indicates a need to understand what 
Feasey et al.

 these ecological niches might be, and then to define the transmission pathways of African 
clades of S. Enteritidis, in order to facilitate public health interventions to prevent iNTS 
disease.
The evolution of the S. Enteritidis virulence plasmid is intriguing; pSENV is the smallest of 
the known Salmonella virulence-associated plasmids, but in SSA, the plasmid has nearly 
doubled in size partly through the acquisition of AMR genes. The absence of tra genes 
necessary for conjugal transfer either indicates that MDR status has evolved through 
acquisition of MGEs multiple times or through clonal expansion and vertical transmission of 
the plasmid to progeny. The available data suggest that the former scenario has happened 
twice, once in West Africa, and once in Central/Eastern Africa.
Despite S. Enteritidis being reported as a common cause of bloodstream infection (BSI) in 
Africa6,7 the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) found that Salmonella serotypes 
were an uncommon cause of moderate to severe diarrhoea in African children less than 5-
years of age42. Our data associating the African lineages with invasive disease is also 
consistent with data presented in a recent Kenyan study comparing a limited number and 
diversity of S. Enteritidis isolates from blood and stool. Applying the lineages defined in this 
study to the genome data reported from Kenya showed that 20.4% of isolates from that study 
belonging to the global clade were associated with invasive disease, whereas 63.2% of the 
isolates in that study belonging to our Central/Eastern African clade were associated with 
invasive disease43. The remaining isolates were associated with cases of enterocolitis or 
asymptomatic carriage, confirming that the Central/Eastern African clade can also cause 
enterocolitis. The association of S. Enteritidis clades circulating in sub-Saharan Africa with 
iNTS disease may reflect the fact that their geographical distribution permits them to behave 
as opportunistic invasive pathogens in a setting where advanced immunosuppressive disease 
is highly prevalent in human populations.
In summary, two clades of S. Enteritidis have emerged in Africa, which have different 
phenotypes and genotypes to the strains of S. Enteritidis circulating in the industrial world. 
These strains display evidence of changing host adaptation, different virulence determinants 
and multi-drug resistance, a parallel situation to the evolutionary history of S. Typhimurium 
ST313. They may have different ecologies and/or host ranges to global strains and have 
caused epidemics of BSI in at least three countries in SSA, yet are rarely responsible for 
disease in South Africa. An investigation into the environmental reservoirs and transmission 
of these pathogens is warranted and urgently required.
Online Methods
Bacterial Isolates
S. Enteritidis isolates were selected on the basis of six factors; date of original isolation, 
antimicrobial susceptibility pattern, geographic site of original isolation, source (human 
[invasive vs stool], animal or environmental), phage type (where available), and multilocus 
variable number tandem repeat (MLVA) type (where available). S. Enteritidis P125109 
(EMBL accession no. AM933172) isolated from a poultry farm from the UK was used as a

 reference32. The full metadata are in Supplementary Table 1. Isolates have been attributed to 
region according to United Nations statistical divisions.
Sequencing, SNP-calling, construction of phylogeny and comparative genomics
PCR libraries were prepared from 500 ng of DNA as previously described45. Isolates were 
sequenced using Illumina GA II, HiSeq 2000 and MiSeq machines (Illumina, San Diego, 
CA, USA) and 150 bp paired-end reads were generated. The strains were aligned to 
Salmonella Enteritidis reference genome P125109 using a pipeline developed in-house at the 
Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI). For each isolate sequenced, the raw sequence read 
pairs were split to reduce the overall memory usage and allow reads to be aligned using 
more than one CPU. The reads were then aligned using SMALT, a hashing based sequence 
aligner. The aligned and unmapped reads were combined into a single BAM file. Picard was 
used to identify and flag optical duplicates generated during the making of a standard 
Illumina library, which reduces possible effects of PCR bias. All of the alignments were 
created in a standardized manner, with the commands and parameters stored in the header of 
each BAM file, allowing for the results to be easily reproduced.
The combined BAM file for each isolate was used as input data in the SAMtools mpileup 
program to call SNPs and small indels, producing a BCF file describing all of the variant 
base positions46. A pseudo-genome was constructed by substituting the base call at each 
variant or non-variant site, defined in the BCF file, in the reference genome. Only base calls 
with a depth of coverage >4 or quality >50 were considered in this analysis. Base calls in the 
BCF file failing this quality control filter were replaced with the “N” character in the 
pseudo-genome sequence.
All of the software developed is freely available for download from GitHub under an open 
source license, GNU GPL 3.
Phylogenetic modelling was based on the assumption of a single common ancestor, therefore 
variable regions where horizontal genetic transfer occurs were excluded47,48. A maximum 
likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree was then built from the alignments of the isolates using 
RAxML (version 7.0.4) using a GTR+I+G model49. The maximum-likelihood phylogeny 
was supported by 100 bootstrap pseudo-replicate analyses of the alignment data. Clades 
were predicted using Hierarchical Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure (HierBAPS)24. 
This process was repeated to construct the plasmid phylogeny, using reads that aligned to 
pSENV.
To ascertain the presence of the clusters defined by HierBAPs in the Public Health England 
(PHE) routine Salmonella surveillance collection, seventeen isolates representing the 
diversity of the collection were compared against 2986 S. Enteritidis PHE genomes. Single 
linkage SNP clustering was performed as previously described50. A maximum-likelihood 
phylogeny showing the integration of the seventeen isolates with 50-SNP cluster 
representatives of the PHE S. Enteritidis collection was constructed as above. FASTQ reads 
from all PHE sequences in this study can be found at the PHE Pathogens BioProject at the 
National Center for Biotechnology Information (Accession PRJNA248792).

 Temporal reconstruction was performed using Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling 
Trees (BEAST version 1.8.2)51. A relaxed lognormal clock model was initially employed. 
The results of this model indicated that a constant clock model was not appropriate, as the 
posterior of the standard deviation of the clock rate did not include zero. A range of 
biologically plausible population models (constant, exponential and skyline) was 
investigated. Skyline models can be biased by non-uniform sampling and we observed a 
strong similarity between reconstructed skyline population and the histogram of sampling 
dates and so this model was excluded. The exponential models consistently failed to 
converge and were excluded. Thus, for all datasets, lognormal clock and constant population 
size models were used. The computational expense required for this analysis precluded 
running estimators for model selection. However, we note that Deng et al used the same 
models in their analysis of 125 S. Enteritidis isolates. Default priors were used except for 
ucld.mean, Gamma(0.001,1000), initial: 0.0001; exponential.popSize, LogNormal(10,1.5), 
initial: 121.
Three chains of 100 million states were run in parallel for each clade of the four major 
HierBAPS clades, as well as a fourth chain without genomic data to examine the influence 
of the prior, which in all cases was uninformative. The final results, as used here, all had 
effective sample sizes (ESS) of over 200 and had convergence between all three runs. For the 
Global and Global Outlier lineages, the datasets were not computationally feasible to 
analyse. We thus created 3 further random subsets of the data by drawing n isolates from 
each sampled year where n was sampled from a Poisson distribution where λ=2. The 
posteriors of all subsets were extremely similar and runs were combined to produce the final 
most recent common ancestor (MRCA) estimates.
In order to gain a detailed insight into genomic differences, a single high quality sequence 
from Malawian S. Enteritidis isolate D7795 was aligned against the P125109 using 
ABACAS and annotated52. Differences were manually curated against the reference using 
the Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT)53. Sections of contigs which were incorporated into 
the alignment, but which did not align with P125109 were manually inspected and compared 
to the public databases using BLASTn. When these regions appeared to be novel prophages, 
they were annotated using the phage search tool PHAST and manually curated54. In order to 
investigate whether the SNPs and/or indels that were predicted to be responsible for 
pseudogene formation in D7795 were distinct to that isolate or conserved across both 
African epidemic clades, all isolates were aligned to P12509 and the relevant SNPs/indels 
investigated using in-silico PCR of the aligned sequences. Manual curation was performed 
to confirm the nature of all pseudogene-associated SNPs/indels. NS-SNPs identified in 
D7795 were sorted throughout the African clades by extracting and aligning the appropriate 
gene sequences from P125109 and D7795. The coordinates of the NS-SNPs were then used 
to identify the relevant sequence and determine the nature of the base.
Accessory genome
The pangenome for the dataset was predicted using ROARY 55. Genes were considered to 
be core to S. Enteritidis if present in ≥90% of isolates. A relaxed definition of core genome 
was used as assemblies were used to generate it and the more assemblies one uses, the more

 likely it is that a core gene will be missed in one sample due to an assembly error. The 
remaining genes were considered to be core to the clades/clusters predicted by HierBAPS if 
present in ≥75% if isolates from within each clade/cluster. These genes were then curated 
manually using ACT to search for their presence and position in P125109 or the improved 
draft assembly of representative isolates of each of the other clades if not present in 
P125109. Any large accessory regions identified were blasted against the assembled 
genomes of the entire collection to confirm they were grossly intact.
Plasmid identification
Plasmid DNA was extracted from isolate D7795 using the Kado & Liu method and 
separated by gel-electrophoresis alongside plasmids of known size, to estimate the number 
and size of plasmids present56. Plasmid conjugation was attempted by mixing 100 μL of 
overnight culture of donor and recipient strains (rifampicin resistant Escherichia coli C600) 
on Luria-Bertani agar plates and incubating overnight at 26°C and 37°C. The plasmid was 
sequenced using the PacBio platform to gain long reads and a single improved draft 
assembly, which was aligned against P125109 plasmid pSENV (Accession Number 
HG970000). For novel regions of the plasmid from isolate D7795, genes were predicted 
using GLIMMER and manual annotations applied based on homology searches against the 
public databases, using both BLASTn and FASTA. The plasmid phylogeny was 
reconstructed using the same methodology as the chromosome; a maximum likelihood (ML) 
phylogenetic tree was built from the alignments of the isolates using RAxML (version 7.0.4) 
using a GTR+I+G model
Identification of AMR genes
A manually curated version of the Resfinder database was used to investigate the isolates for 
the presence of AMR genes57. To reduce redundancy, the database was clustered using CD-
HIT-EST58, with the alignment length of the shorter sequence required to be 90% the length 
of the longer sequence. All other options were left as the defaults. The representative gene of 
each cluster was then mapped with SMALT to the assemblies of each isolate to identify and 
matches with an identity of 90% or greater were considered significant, in line with the 
default clustering parameters of CD-HIT-EST. Where partial matches were identified at the 
ends of contigs, having an identity of 90% or greater to the matched region of the gene, 
potential AMR gene presence was recorded. To confirm presence of these partial matches, 
raw sequencing reads of the pertinent isolates were mapped using SMALT to these genes to 
check for 90% identity across the entire gene.
Biolog™ growth substrate platform profiling
The Biolog™ platform enables the simultaneous quantitative measurement of a number of 
cellular phenotypes, and therefore the creation of a phenotypic profile of a variety of assay 
conditions59. Incubation and recording of phenotypic data were performed using an 
OmniLog® plate reader.
In these experiments, two replicates of D7795 were compared to two replicates of a PT4 like 
strain at 28°C and 37°C to represent environmental and human temperatures. Biolog™ 
plates PM1-4 and 9 (Carbon source [PM1,PM2], nitrogen source [PM3] and phosphor and

 sulphur source [PM4] metabolism and osmotic pressure [PM9]) were used. Each well was 
inoculated as described below, thereby testing 475 conditions at once (each plate has one 
negative control well).
The isolates were cultured overnight on LB-agar at 37°C in air to exclude contamination. 
Colonies were scraped off plates and dispensed into IF-0a solution (Biolog) to a cell density 
corresponding to 81% transmittance. For each plate used, 880 µL of this cell suspension was 
added to 10 mL IF-10b GP/GP solution (Biolog) and 120 µL dye mix G (Biolog). This was 
then supplemented with a 1 mL solution of 7.5 mM D-ribose (Sigma), 2 mM magnesium 
chloride, 1 mM calcium chloride, 2 mM sodium pyrophosphate (Sigma), 25 µM L-arginine 
(Sigma), 25 µM L-methionine (Sigma), 25 µM hypoxanthine (Sigma), 10 µM lipoamide 
(Sigma), 5 µM nicotine adenine dinucleotide (Sigma), 0.25 µM riboflavin (Sigma), 0.005% 
by mass yeast extract (Fluka) and 0.005% by mass Tween 80 (Sigma). 100µl of this mixture 
was dispensed into each well on the assay plate. Plates were then allowed to equilibrate in 
air for 5 min prior to being sealed in airtight bags and loaded into the Omnilog machine 
(Biolog). Plates were scanned every 15 min for 48 hours while incubated at 28°C and 37°C 
in air. Culture under anaerobic conditions was unavailable. Two paired replicates were 
performed for each of the two isolates.
After completion of the run, the signal data were compiled and analysed using the limma 
package in ‘R’ described previously60. A log-fold change of 0.5 controlling for a 5% false 
discovery rate was used as a cut-off for investigating a specific metabolite further using 
Pathway Tools61 and whether the metabolic change was related to pseudogenes and non 
synonymous(NS)-SNPs in genes in the respective genomes.
In vivo Infection Model
Two isolates were used in the animal models: S. Enteritidis P125109 and D7795. 
Unvaccinated commercial female egg-layer Lohmann Brown chicks (Domestic Fowl [Gallus 
gallus]) were obtained from a commercial hatchery and housed in secure floor pens at a 
temperature of 25°C. Eight chicks per strain per time point were inoculated by gavage at 10 
days (d) of age and received a dose of ~108 Salmonella colony forming units (CFU) in a 
volume of 0.2 mL. Subsequently, four to five birds from each group were humanely killed at 
3, 7 or 21 d post-infection (p.i.). At post mortem, the liver, spleen, and caecal contents were 
removed aseptically, homogenised, serially diluted and dispensed onto Brilliant Green agar 
(Oxoid) to quantify colony forming units (CFU) as described previously62. Statistical 
analysis was performed using SPSS, version 20 (IBM). Kruskal-Wallis was used to compare 
bacterial loads between infected groups.
All work was conducted in accordance with the UK legislation governing experimental 
animals, Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, under project licence 40/3652 and was 
approved by the University of Liverpool ethical review process prior to the award of the 
project license. The licensing procedure requires power calculations to determine minimal 
group sizes for each procedure to ensure results are significant. For these experiments a 
group size of 8 birds per time point was chosen, based on a variation in 1.0 log10 in bacterial 
count between groups as being significant along with prior experience of Salmonella 
infection studies. Groups were randomly selected on receipt from the hatchery and

 investigators conducting animal experiments were not blinded, as the current UK code of 
practice requires all cages or pens to be fully labeled with experimental details. No animals 
were excluded from the analysis. All animals were checked a minimum of twice daily to 
ensure their health and welfare.
