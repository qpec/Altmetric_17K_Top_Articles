IMPORTANCE Initiatives to reduce sodium in packaged foods have been launched in the
United States, yet corresponding changes in the amount of sodium that US households
obtain from packaged foods have not been evaluated, to our knowledge.
OBJECTIVE To assess 15-year changes in the amount of sodium that US households acquire
from packaged food purchases, the sodium content of purchases, and the proportion of
households that have purchases with optimal sodium density.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Longitudinal study of US households in the 2000 to
2014 Nielsen Homescan Consumer Panel, a population-based sample of households that
used barcode scanners to record all packaged foods purchased throughout the year.
Time-varying brand- and product-specific nutrition information was used for 1 490 141
products.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Sociodemographic-adjusted changes in mean sodium per
capita (mg/d) and sodium content (mg/100 g), overall and for top food group sources of
sodium, and the proportion of households that have total purchases with sodium density
of 1.1 mg/kcal or less.
RESULTS In a nationwide sample of 172 042 US households (754 608 year-level
observations), the amount of sodium that households acquired from packaged food and
beverage purchases decreased significantly between 2000 and 2014 by 396 mg/d (95% CI,
−407 to −385 mg/d) per capita. The sodium content of households’packaged food purchases
decreased significantly during this 15-year period by 49 mg/100 g (95% CI, −50 to −48
mg/100 g), a 12.0% decline; decreases began in 2005 and continued through 2014.
Moreover, the sodium content of households’purchases decreased significantly for all top
food sources of sodium between 2000 and 2014, including declines of more than 100
mg/100 g for condiments, sauces, and dips (−114 mg/100 g; 95% CI, −117 to −111 mg/100 g)
and salty snacks (−142 mg/100 g; 95% CI, −144 to −141 mg/100 g). However, in all years, less
than 2% of US households had packaged food and beverage purchases with sodium density
of 1.1 mg/kcal or less.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this nationwide study, significant reductions in sodium
from packaged food purchases were achieved in the past 15 years. Nonetheless, most US
households had food and beverage purchases with excessive sodium density. Findings
suggest that more concerted sodium reduction efforts are needed in the United States.

xcessive dietary sodium intake has been established as
a modifiable risk factor for hypertension and cardio-
vascular disease.1-3 However, 89% to 90% of US chil-
dren and adults exceeded the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines
for Americans recommended limit for sodium intake in
2009-2012.4Tolowerpopulation-levelsodiumintakeofAmeri-
cans, the Institute of Medicine recommends that reducing so-
dium in packaged foods is essential5 because most sodium in-
take comes from store-bought foods6 and is added during
industrial food processing.7 The Institute of Medicine called
fortheuseofnovelmethodsanddatasourcestoenhancemoni-
toring of sodium in the United States, particularly to evaluate
theeffectivenessofcurrentvoluntaryinitiativesbyfoodmanu-
facturers to reduce the sodium content of packaged foods, in-
cluding the National Salt Reduction Initiative (NSRI) and so-
dium reduction pledges by companies, such as Nestlé and
General Mills.5,8,9
Nonetheless,littleisknownaboutwhethersodiuminpack-
aged foods has changed during the past 15 years. Prior
studies10-14 monitoring sodium intake using dietary self-
report are limited by changes in assessment methods over time
and lack of up-to-date food composition data for the diverse
and constantly changing array of products in the US food sup-
ply. Few evaluations of changes in the sodium content of pack-
agedfoodsusinganalyticornutritionlabeldatahavebeencon-
ducted in the United States, and these studies8,9,15,16 evaluated
only a limited number of products in selected food catego-
ries.Toourknowledge,nostudieshaveexaminedhowchanges
in the sodium content of products translate to changes for
households’grocery store purchases.
To address these knowledge gaps, this study used time-
varying product- and brand-specific nutrition label data for ap-
proximately 1.5 million packaged foods purchased by a na-
tionwide sample of US households. This study aimed to
examine 15-year trends in the amount of sodium obtained by
US households from packaged food purchases, to evaluate
changes in the sodium content of packaged foods overall and
for major food sources of sodium, and to determine whether
the percentage of US households that have packaged food pur-
chases with optimal sodium density changed between 2000
and 2014.
Methods
Study Population
This study used data from the 2000 to 2014 Nielsen Homes-
canConsumerPanel,aprospectivestudyofpackagedfoodand
beverage purchases by US households (data obtained from The
Nielsen Company, 2014).17 Homescan maintains a nation-
wide sample of 30 000 to 60 000 households each year using
anopen-cohortstudydesigndescribedindetailpreviously18-20
and in the eMethods in the Supplement. Households are pro-
spectively followed and record their purchases continuously
throughout the year. Households must record purchases for at
least 10 months and then may exit the study at any time; new
households are enrolled to maintain national representative-
ness. Mean follow-up time was 4.4 years. The age and sex of
each household member, race/ethnicity and educational level
of the male and female heads of household, and household in-
come were reported by questionnaire. This secondary data
analysis was deemed exempt from University of North Caro-
lina at Chapel Hill institutional review board approval.
To best capture usual shopping habits throughout the year
and to account for storage of products not consumed imme-
diately, analyses used year-level purchases, generated by sum-
mingallpurchasesduringagivencalendaryearforeachhouse-
hold. As described previously, purchases during annual
quarters were deemed unreliable by study investigators if
thresholds for expenditures and the amount purchased were
not met21,22; to ensure consistent reporting, household year-
level observations that included more than 1 unreliable quar-
ter or with extreme purchase amounts (<0.5th percentile or
>99.5th percentile) were excluded (4.9%).
Food and Beverage Purchase Data
Household members used a handheld Universal Product Code
barcode scanner provided by The Nielsen Company to record
each packaged food or beverage purchased from grocery, drug,
and convenience stores; supermarkets; mass merchandisers;
and all other retail food stores. As described elsewhere, our re-
search team linked each barcoded product to its correspond-
ing Nutrition Facts Panel to obtain brand- and product-
specificcalorieandsodiumcontentatthetimeofpurchase.23,24
Product descriptions were used to categorize products at the
barcode level into 40 food groups based on nutritional com-
position and eating behaviors (eTable 1 in the Supplement).25
Foods and beverages without a barcode or a Nutrition Facts
Panel, such as unpackaged fresh fruits and vegetables, fresh
meat sold by weight, or store-prepared ready-to-eat dishes,
were not included. Because some purchased foods may be
wasted and not consumed by household members, sodium
purchased may overestimate sodium intake.
We examined sodium in US households’food and bever-
age purchases using 3 measures. These included (1) sodium per
capita, the amount of sodium (in milligrams) purchased daily
per person; (2) sodium content, the amount of sodium rela-
tive to the amount of food (mg/100 g); and (3) sodium den-
sity, the amount of sodium relative to the energy in food (mg/
1000 kcal).
Key Points
Question Did the amount of sodium in US households’packaged
food purchases change in the past 15 years?
Findings In this longitudinal study of the Nielsen Homescan
Consumer Panel, sodium acquired by US households from
packaged food purchases decreased significantly between 2000
and 2014, and sodium content decreased significantly for
packaged foods overall and for all top food sources of sodium.
Nonetheless, more than 98% of households had packaged food
purchases with sodium density exceeding optimal levels.
Meaning Significant progress toward sodium reduction in US
packaged foods was achieved, but continued efforts are needed to
prevent excess sodium intake.

 Statistical Analysis
Allestimatesofsodiumfromfoodandbeveragepurchaseswere
determined using multivariable, longitudinal, random-
effects regression models to control for changes in the sociode-
mographic characteristics of the Homescan sample over time
and to account for the correlation between repeated mea-
sures within households. To assess the amount of sodium in
households’purchases in each year between 2000 and 2014,
linear models regressed sodium (mg/d) per capita in house-
holds’purchases on year (indicator variables) and sociodemo-
graphic covariates (described below). Separate models were
used for the outcomes of total purchases, foods only, bever-
ages only, and table salt. Longitudinal 2-part models were used
for table salt as described in the eMethods in the Supple-
ment. To put sodium trends in context, models were re-
peated for per capita weight (g/d) and energy (kcal/d) in total,
food, and beverage purchases.
Top food group sources of sodium were identified by rank-
ing based on unadjusted, survey-weighted mean sodium
(mg/d) per capita from each group in 2014. Groups that in-
cluded single-ingredient foods that contain only naturally oc-
curring sodium (eg, milk or eggs) were excluded to be consis-
tent with previous sodium reduction guidance.26 Separate
models were then used to assess the adjusted mean sodium
per capita (mg/d) and percentage contribution to sodium in
packaged food purchases (% mg) for each top food group
source.
To evaluate changes in the mean sodium content of pur-
chases overall and by food group, linear models regressed the
sodium content (mg/100 g) of purchases on year, with adjust-
ment for covariates. Separate models were used for total pur-
chases, foods only, beverages only, and each top food group
source of sodium. To examine variability in sodium content
within food groups, quantile regression models with cluster-
ing on the household were used to predict the adjusted so-
dium content at the 5th, 25th, 50th (median), 75th, and 95th
percentiles.
Finally, trends in the sodium density (mg/1000 kcal) of
total packaged food and beverage purchases were examined
using quantile regression models with clustering on the house-
hold to evaluate changes in sodium density at the 25th, 50th
(median), and 75th percentiles. Scholars recommend that an
optimal sodium density of 1.1 mg/kcal or less, based on the
DASH–Sodium trial and the Healthy Eating Index-2010, can be
used as a practical approach for monitoring sodium levels.27-31
To determine whether the percentage of households that
have total purchases with optimal sodium density changed
between 2000 and 2014, longitudinal logistic regression

 models regressed the binary outcome of sodium density of
1.1 mg/kcal or less on year, with adjustment for covariates.
All models were adjusted for household composition
(single or multiple adults with or without children), house-
hold size (the number of household members in each age and
sex category), joint classification by race/ethnicity (non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, or other races/
ethnicities) and income (≤185%, 186%-400%, or >400% of the
federal poverty level), educational level (maximum level at-
tained by either head of household, categorized as less than
high school, high school, or college or higher), and geo-
graphic market. The Homescan panel includes a higher pro-
portion of non-Hispanic white, high-income, and highly edu-
cated households than the general US population (eTable 2 in
the Supplement). Therefore, to more accurately represent
trends in the US population, the adjusted mean purchases in
each year were predicted using the coefficients from the fully
adjusted models, the distribution of race/ethnicity by in-
come reported by the US Census Bureau for 2014, and mean
values in the Homescan sample for all other covariates.32
Trends over time were assessed by repeating models with
year as a continuous variable; quadratic and cubic terms were
tested and retained in the model when significant to capture
potential nonlinear trends. Statistical significance was evalu-
ated using Wald tests for the joint significance of all terms for
time with 2-sided α = .001 to account for multiple compari-

Results
Amount of Sodium Purchased
This study included 172 042 US households (754 608 year-
level observations) and used nutrition label data for 1 490 141
food and beverage products. The amount of sodium that US
households acquired from packaged foods and beverages pur-
chased from retail food stores decreased significantly be-
tween2000and2014by396mg/d(95%CI,−407to−385mg/d)
per capita from 2363 to 1967 mg/d (Figure 1A and eTable 3 in
the Supplement). During the 15-year study period, sodium ob-
tained from packaged foods (excluding beverages) decreased
by 260 mg/d (95% CI, −267 to −253 mg/d) per capita, and table
salt purchases decreased by 111 mg/d (95% CI, −116 to −105

 mg/d) per capita. Between 2000 and 2014, total purchase
amounts decreased by 193 g/d, primarily due to the 184 g/d per
capita decrease (95% CI, −188 to −179 g/d) in beverage pur-
chases (Figure 1B). However, the amount of packaged foods
purchased by US households showed little change (−9; 95% CI,
−10 to −7 g/d per capita).
The 10 top food group sources of sodium were identified
andtogetherprovidedapproximately70%ofsodiuminhouse-
holds’packaged food and beverage purchases in each year
(Table 1). The amount purchased for each food group re-
mained stable over time (eTable 4 in the Supplement).
Sodium Content (mg/100 g) of Purchases
The sodium content of US households’packaged food pur-
chases (excluding beverages) decreased significantly be-
tween 2000 and 2014 by 49 mg/100 g (95% CI, −50 to −48 mg/
100 g), a 12.0% decline (Figure 2 and eTable 5 in the
Supplement); decreases began in 2005 and continued through
2014. Because total grams purchased decreased due to declin-
ing beverage purchases, decreases in the sodium content of
total packaged food and beverage purchases were significant
yet small (−6; 95% CI, −7 to −5 mg/100 g).
In addition, the mean sodium content of households’pur-
chases decreased significantly for all top food sources of so-
dium between 2000 and 2014 (Table 2), including declines of
more than 100 mg/100 g for condiments, sauces, and dips and
salty snacks. Decreases were at least 10% for the sodium con-
tent of households’purchases of condiments, sauces, and dips
(−14.0%); mixed dishes (−12.6%); salty snacks (−17.3%); breads
(−10.5%); soup (−18.4%); vegetables (−17.1%); and breakfast ce-
real (−16.5%). The range between the 5th and 95th percen-
tiles of sodium content showed wide variation that persisted
in this 15-year period.
Sodium Density (mg/1000 kcal) of Purchases
The median sodium density of households’overall packaged
foodandbeveragepurchasesdecreasedsignificantlyby84mg/
1000 kcal (95% CI, −91 to −77 mg/1000 kcal) from 1712 to 1628
mg/1000 kcal between 2000 and 2014 (Figure 3A and eTable
6 in the Supplement). Sodium density also decreased signifi-
cantly between 2000 and 2014 for all top food group sources
ofsodium(eTable7intheSupplement).Nonetheless,through-
out the 15-year period, less than 2% of US households had total
packaged food and beverage purchases with optimal sodium
density (≤1.1 mg/kcal), although prevalence increases be-
tween 2000 and 2014 (+0.5 percentage point) were statisti-
cally significant (Figure 3B).
Discussion
Using food composition data for approximately 1.5 million
products, this study found that sodium from packaged food
and beverage purchases decreased significantly by 396 mg/d
per capita between 2000 and 2014 in a nationwide sample of
US households. The sodium content of packaged food pur-
chases declined by 12.0% overall and by at least 10% for 7 of
10 top food group sources of sodium. Although a significant
15-year reduction in the median sodium density of house-
holds’packaged food and beverage purchases was achieved,
almost all US households had purchases exceeding optimal so-
dium density levels. In summary, sodium in US households’
packaged food purchases decreased significantly and consis-
tently for all 3 measures examined (mg/d, mg/100 g, and mg/
1000 kcal), but further reductions are needed.

translate to reductions in sodium intake. Previous analyses

and did not consistently update food composition data to keep
pace with rapid changes in the food supply.

 Our study found that the sodium content of packaged food
purchases decreased significantly between 2000 and 2014,
both overall (−12.0%) and for all top food group sources of so-
dium. In contrast, one study8 reported minimal declines
(−3.5%)insodiumcontentbyreformulationbetween2005and
2011 yet included only 402 packaged foods. Similar to our re-
sults, modest declines (−6.8%) in sales-weighted sodium con-
tent between 2009 and 2014 were found for food categories
targeted by the NSRI, a coalition of local and state health or-
ganizations that set voluntary sodium reduction targets for
packaged and restaurant foods.9,36 Our examination of long-
term trends revealed that decreases in sodium per capita
and sodium content began in 2005, predating the NSRI’
s
2009 baseline.
Despite significant declines in the sodium density of pur-
chases throughout the past 15 years, most US households had
packaged food and beverage purchases with sodium density
exceeding 1.1 mg/kcal. This finding is consistent with
studies14,30,35 showing that the mean sodium density of di-
etary intake from stores remained above the optimal level and
that no significant reductions in the prevalence of excessive
sodium intake were achieved between 2003 and 2010. More-
over, 15-year changes in total sodium per capita and sodium
content of packaged foods in our study represent slow an-
nual rates of decline (−1.1% and −0.8% per year, respec-
tively), far slower than the rate recommended by the Euro-
pean Union Framework (−4% per year).37 Our findings support
the need for more concerted nationwide efforts to accelerate
the pace of sodium reduction, and the US Food and Drug Ad-
ministration’
s recently proposed phased targets for the so-
dium content of industrially processed foods will likely have
a critical role.26
Limitations and Strengths
A key limitation of this study is that households do not report
whether all purchased foods are consumed, so these data can-
not examine sodium intake. Purchases of table salt may not
reflectconsumptionbecauseofwastageandotheruses.38How-
ever, results of waste collection studies39,40 suggest that con-
sumer-level food loss has not changed in the past 15 years;
therefore, trends in sodium purchased may be an adequate re-
flection of trends in sodium intake. This analysis does not in-
clude foods without a barcode or a Nutrition Facts Panel, in-
cluding cut-to-order lunch meat and store-prepared hot foods,

 which may also be sources of sodium in store purchases. For
a subsample of participants who manually recorded nonpack-
aged food purchases in addition to scanning packaged foods,
packaged foods accounted for 78% of store expenditures24;
however, because nonpackaged foods could not be linked to
nutrition information, the proportion of sodium purchased
from packaged foods cannot be determined. Additional stud-
ies are needed to examine whether decreases in sodium from
packaged foods were offset by increases in sodium from away-
from-home sources. The significant decreases in sodium pur-
chased in our study may be attributable to changes in health-
consciouspurchasingbehaviorsbyconsumersortoreductions
in the sodium content of packaged foods by manufacturers;
however, there were no major shifts in the amount pur-
chased for key food groups, suggesting that sodium declines
may relate mainly to reformulation.
Although US Food and Drug Administration regulations al-
low sodium content stated on the Nutrition Facts Panel to de-
viate from actual content in a product by up to 20%,41 ex-
perts found that the sales-weighted mean sodium content
based on nutrition labels agreed closely with analytically as-
sessed values (<10% difference) for most top food sources of
sodium.11,42Moreover,thesevalidationstudies11,42indicatethat
discrepancies primarily occur for products with nutrition la-
bel sodium content that is higher than the analytic measure-
ment,potentiallybecausemanufacturershavenotmadecostly
updates to labels when sodium reduction is within the al-
lowed margin of error. Therefore, our results may underesti-
mate actual sodium reductions. No recommendations exist for
theoverallsodiumdensityofpurchases,sosodiumdensitywas
compared with the optimal level previously derived for di-
etaryintake;however,thissodiumdensitycutoffhasbeenused
by governmental advisory committees and researchers to
evaluate store-bought foods and processed foods.29-31
Bias from underrecording of purchases may occur if par-
ticipants are too busy to scan all items or selectively choose
to not record products perceived as unhealthy; however, vali-
dationstudiesconcludethattheaccuracyoftheHomescandata
is comparable to other commonly used government-
collected data sets.18 Because scanning purchases is time con-
suming, selection bias is possible; the high proportions of non-
Hispanic white and high-income households in our study
suggest that some subpopulations might be better able to
handle the burden of data recording and participate in the
study. Consequently, findings may not be generalizable to the
US population.
A main strength of this study is the use of time-varying
brand- and product-specific sodium content data. Other
strengths include objective scanning of purchases that avoids
bias inherent in self-reported dietary intake, the large nation-
wide sample of households, and ability to monitor long-term
trends.
Conclusions
In this nationwide study, the amount of sodium that US house-
holds acquired from packaged foods and beverages de-
creased significantly between 2000 and 2014, with corre-
sponding declines in the sodium content of packaged food
purchases. Despite these improvements, almost all US house-
holds continue to have total packaged food purchases with ex-
cessivesodiumdensity.Theslowrateofdeclineinsodiumfrom
store-bought foods suggests that more concerted sodium re-
duction efforts are necessary in the United States. Future stud-
ies are needed to examine sodium trends by race/ethnicity and
income to identify vulnerable subpopulations that further in-
terventions should target.
