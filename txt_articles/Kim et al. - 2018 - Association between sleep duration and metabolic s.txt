Abstract
Background: Both short and long sleep duration have been consistently studied as a risk factor for obesity,
hyperglycemia and hypertension. In this cross-sectional study, we provide an updated analysis of the Health
Examinees (HEXA) study on the association between sleep duration and metabolic syndrome (MetS) occurrence
among Koreans age 40–69 year olds.
Methods: A total of 133,608 subjects (44,930 men, 88,678 women) were enrolled in the HEXA study 2004–2013.
Sleep duration was categorized into 4 sleep categories (< 6 h, 6 to < 8 h, 8 to < 10 h, ≥10 h). MetS criterion was
based on the National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III. Logistic regression was used to
calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Results: Compared with individuals sleeping 6 to < 8 h per day, less than 6 h of sleep was associated with MetS
(multivariable adjusted OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.05–1.19) and elevated waist circumference (1.15, 1.08–1.23) among men;
with elevated waist circumference (1.09, 1.04–1.14) among women. Greater than 10 h of sleep was associated with
MetS (1.28, 1.08–1.50) and elevated triglycerides (1.33, 1.14–1.56) among men; with MetS (1.40, 1.24–1.58), elevated
waist circumference (1.14, 1.02–1.27), elevated triglycerides (1.41, 1.25–1.58), reduced high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL-C) (1.24, 1.12–1.38), and elevated fasting glucose (1.39, 1.23–1.57) among women.
Conclusions: Less than 6 h of sleep is associated with elevated waist circumference among both men and women
and with MetS among men only. Greater than 10 h of sleep is associated with MetS and elevated triglycerides
among both men and women and with elevated waist circumference, reduced HDL-C, and elevated fasting
glucose among women only.

Background
Sleep is a lifestyle component that is often overlooked
but can be viewed as an important preventive measure,
an indicator to assess one’s current health status, or a
health outcome which may lead to other health compli-
cations [1]. Accordingly, to promote good sleep quality,
full daytime alertness and overall well-being, sleep
guidelines have recommended adults to sleep 7–8 h per
night and to practice healthy sleep hygiene such as
limiting daytime naptimes to 30 min, avoiding stimu-
lants such as caffeine before bedtime, avoiding heavy or
rich foods (i.e. fatty or fried, spicy foods, citrus fruits)
and ensuring adequate exposure to natural light [2, 3].
However, both insufficient and excessive sleep have been
consistently reported to be associated with various
health-related conditions such as hypertension, obesity
[4], diabetes [5, 6], cardiovascular events or mortality
[5–9], and stroke [5]. While many of these epidemio-
logical studies can be summarized to show a U- shaped
association between sleep duration and poor health out-
comes, specifically how many hours are deemed deleteri-
ous and potential gender differences in the association
remain equivocal [10, 11]. Additionally, many studies

 have been broadly defined by ‘short’ and ‘long’ sleep with
varying sleep hour categories, which may cloud the
dose-response relationship between the specific hours of
sleep and health outcomes.
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is defined as a metabolic
disorder consisting of at least three of the following: ele-
vated waist circumference, high triglyceride levels, low
high-density cholesterol levels, hypertension and high
fasting glucose. Given its high prevalence rates in Korea,
approximately 25–30% among adults throughout the last
decade, it is critical to identify the modifiable risk factors
associated with metabolic syndrome and its components
[12]. In Korea, the Health Examinees (HEXA) study pro-
vides information on sleep duration, a lifestyle factor that
has been studied to be associated with metabolic syn-
drome. Specifically, a preliminary HEXA study on sleep
duration and metabolic syndrome has been published to
demonstrate an association between long sleep and meta-
bolic syndrome among middle-aged and elderly Korean
women [13]. However, this preliminary study was limited
to HEXA survey years 2004–2008 which had categorized
sleep duration into 2- h intervals, limiting specific sleep
hour effects. Therefore, the current study, with an updated
analysis of the previous HEXA study, present findings not
shown in prior studies. This current study is the largest
study examining a dose-response association between
sleep duration (with supplemental analysis using 1-h inter-
val sleep duration) and MetS and its components among
both men and women.
Methods
Study population
The HEXA study (n = 169,722) is a large-scale genomic
community-based study comprised of Koreans in age
range 40–69 during the years 2004–2013. Details of the
HEXA study rationale, design, and baseline characteris-
tics are described in previous papers [14, 15]. This study
uses HEXA-Gem (HEXA-G) participant sample that
have been further restricted with participating site eligi-
bility criteria [16].
Among the HEXA-G (n = 139,348) study subjects,
participants with missing sleep information (n =
1637), or on any metabolic syndrome component
(n = 4103) were excluded. A total of 133,608 subjects
with 44,930 men and 88,678 women (Fig. 1) were in-
cluded as the final analytic sample. The HEXA study
protocol was approved by the Institutional Review
Board (IRB) of the Seoul National University Hos-
pital, Seoul, Korea (IRB number 0608–018- 179) and
the Korea National Institute of Health (IRB number
2014–08-02-3C-A). All study participants gave writ-
ten informed consent prior to entering the study.
Assessment of sleep duration
For HEXA study years 2004–2008, sleep duration was
assessed by the following question: “In the past year, on
average, how many hours of sleep (including daytime
naps) did you take per day?” with the following 4 cat-
egory responses: < 6 h, 6 to < 8 h, 8 to < 10 h, ≥10 h. For
HEXA study years 2009–2013, sleep duration question
was modified to be open-ended with a slight modifica-
tion in the question: “In the past year, on average, how
many hours/minutes of sleep (including daytime naps)
did you take per day?” The responses were then con-
verted to the same 4 sleep category responses. In the
multivariable analysis, 6 to < 8 h category was selected
as reference since 6 to < 8 h is the median sleep category
for the sample and to ensure comparability with the pre-
vious HEXA study [13].

 Definition of metabolic syndrome
The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treat-
ment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) is a commonly used meta-
bolic
syndrome
criteria
oriented
towards
assessing
cardiovascular diseases [17]. Our study defined metabolic
syndrome using NCEP ATP III to ensure consistency and
comparability with our previously published HEXA studies
[18]. Participants who met three or more of the following
criteria were classified as having metabolic syndrome: 1)
waist circumference (WC) ≥90 and ≥ 80 cm for men and
women, respectively; 2) triglycerides (TG) ≥150 mg/dL or
drug treatment for elevated triglycerides; 3) high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ≤40 and ≤ 50 mg/dL in
men and women, respectively; 4) systolic blood pressure
(BP) ≥130, diastolic BP ≥85 mmHg or drug treatment for
elevated BP; and 5) fasting glucose ≥100 mg/dL or drug
treatment for elevated fasting glucose.
Covariates
The final model used in our study adjusted for the fol-
lowing covariates: age, education, occupation, marital
status, and menopausal status (women only). Each of the
covariates was categorized in the same way as the previ-
ously HEXA study on snoring and metabolic syndrome
[18]. Education had three categories: middle school or
below, high school graduate, and college or above. Occu-
pation had three categories: non-manual, manual, and
unemployed. Marital status had two categories: married
or single. Menopausal status had two categories: pre- or
post-menopausal.
Additional
lifestyle
covariates
were
considered.
Current smokers were defined as those who smoked a
minimum of 100 cigarettes during their lifetime and
continued to smoke; non-smokers as those who have
never smoked in their lifetime or have quit. Current
drinkers were defined as those who drink alcohol at the
time of survey and non-drinkers as those who have
never drank alcohol or have abstained from alcohol
drinking. Regular exercisers were defined as those en-
gaging in routine physical activity. A food composition
table proposed by the Korean Health and Industry of
Development Institute was used to calculate the dietary
intake measured by total caloric (k/cal) intake [19]. For
all categorical covariates, missing data was assigned as
“unknown”. Missing data was assigned as “unknown” for
categorical variables.
Statistical analysis
We’ve assess the association between sleep duration and
MetS separately by gender. Likelihood ratio tests with
the use of a cross-product term to calculate gender
interaction p-values. To assess the basic characteristics
of our sample in regards to sleep duration categories, a
chi-square test (for categorical variables) and analysis of
variance (ANOVA) (for continuous variables) were per-
formed. A multivariable stepwise analysis was used to deter-
mine a parsimonious model for the final logistic regression
models. To calculate prevalence odds ratios (ORs) and 95%
confidence intervals (95% CIs), logistic regression analyses
were performed. All p-values were two-sided, and statistical
significance was set at below 0.05. A parsimonious model of
regression was determined via multivariable stepwise ana-
lysis. The final model was adjusted for age (continuous),
education, occupation, menopausal status (only women),
smoking (only men) and drinking status, routine exercise
and dietary intake (continuous) were adjusted. Marital status
was not included in the models as it did not pose a signifi-
cant effect on the relationship between sleep duration and
MetS. While smoking is an important covariate for both
sleep duration and MetS occurrence, the percent of current
smokers among women was an average of 2.1% and there-
fore, was deleted from the model in women. Energy intake
variable accounted for the individual dietary factors (i.e.,
fruit, vegetables, and meat) as they were highly correlated. A
separate analysis with individual dietary factors adjusted did
not affect the association between sleep duration and MetS.
Moreover, we excluded subjects with a previous diagnosis
of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia to ac-
count for comorbidities via sensitivity analysis. We also
examined 1-h interval sleep duration and MetS and its
components as a supplemental analysis. SAS software ver-
sion 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used to per-
form all statistical analyses.
Results
A summary of the sample baseline characteristics catego-
rized by sleep duration is available in Table 1. About
10.9% of men and 12.7% of women slept less than 6 h,
1.5% of men and 1.7% of women slept greater than 10 h.
The overall prevalence of MetS was 29.1% men and 24.5%
women (Table 2). All selected covariates differed at statis-
tical significance among the sleep duration categories.
The odds ratios for MetS and its components by sleep
duration are in Table 3. In both men and women, ORs
displayed a J-shaped association between sleep duration
and MetS (< 6 h OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.05–1.19 and ≥ 10 h
OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.08–1.50 in men; < 6 h OR: 1.05, 95%
CI: 1.00–1.10 and ≥ 10 h OR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.24–1.58 in
women). Less than 6 h sleep was also associated with el-
evated waist circumference (OR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.08–1.23
in men; OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.04–1.14 in women). Among
women, ≥10 h sleep was associated with all components
of MetS, with the exception of elevated blood pressure.
On the other hand, among the components, only ele-
vated triglyceride levels were associated with ≥10 h sleep
among men. Gender interaction was significant for MetS
and all its components with p-interaction values < 0.001.
Moreover, a sensitivity analysis accounting for did not

 alter the relationship of sleep duration with the odds for
MetS (< 6 h OR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.01–1.19, ≥10 h OR: 1.21,
95% CI: 0.97–1.51 in men and < 6 h OR: 1.00 95% CI:
0.94–1.07; ≥10 h OR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.3–1.65 in women).
To assess the dose-response relationship of specific
sleep duration hours and MetS, a supplemental analysis
from HEXA study years 2009–2013 (73,530 subjects of
which 24,979 men and 48,551 women) was performed
(Additional file 1: Table S1). Sleep duration was catego-
rized into 1-h intervals, from < 5 h to ≥10 h. Among
men, only 5 h sleep was associated with metabolic syn-
drome (OR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.02–1.25). In contrast, among
women, 9 and ≥ 10 h sleep were significantly associated
with MetS (OR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.04–1.27 and OR: 1.37,
95% CI: 1.16–1.63 respectively). In the supplemental
analysis, gender p-interaction value was significant for
MetS and its components (all p-interaction < 0.001) but
not for low HDL-C and high fasting glucose (p-inter-
action 0.303 and 0.323, respectively).
Discussion
The results of the updated HEXA-G (2004–2013) analysis
on sleep duration and metabolic syndrome and its compo-
nents confirm and further expand on the previously

 published HEXA study (2004–2008) [13], displaying find-
ings not shown in prior studies. In the previous HEXA
study [13], after adjusting for covariates, 10 h sleep or
greater was associated with MetS in women only (OR:
1.53, 95% CI: 1.32–1.78 for women; OR: 1.19, 95% CI:
0.98–1.46 for men); while, less than 6 h sleep was not as-
sociated with MetS in both men and women (OR: 1.09,
95% CI: 0.99–1.19; OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.97–1.11 respect-
ively). However, in the current study, with expanded sam-
ple size and power, a positive association was observed
between 10 h sleep or greater and MetS in both men and
women (OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.08–1.50; OR: 1.40, 95% CI:
1.24–1.58 respectively) as well as in less than 6 h sleep
among men (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.05–1.19). In the supple-
mental analysis, a similar J-shape trend existed but with a
significant positive association between 10 h sleep or
greater and MetS only in women; between 5 h sleep and
MetS only in men. Gender interaction in the association
between sleep duration and metabolic syndrome was sta-
tistically significant in our study which complements the
gender difference reported in a study looking at the asso-
ciation between sleep duration and mortality [20]. While
the exact mechanisms are unclear, one explanation may
be that women experiencing menopausal transition face
erratic fluctuations and eventual decline in estrogens as
well as ovarian oestradiol which may lead to frequent
sleep disruptions [21, 22], a common characteristic of long
sleep duration [23]. Another study posits that women may
have shorter circadian period contributing to higher
prevalence of insomnia and/or perception of less restora-
tive sleep [24]. Additionally, a study examining the associ-
ation between inflammatory markers and sleep duration
observed
higher
levels
of
interleukin-6
(IL-6)
and
C-reactive protein (CRP) in women who slept less than 5 h
or more than 9 h, while no significant marker variation
was observed in men [25]. Notably, a recent meta-analysis
stated that women may be more vulnerable to the effects
of sleep disturbance and displayed greater increases of CRP
and IL-6 compared with men. The review also reported
that long sleep duration, but not short duration was associ-
ated with increases in CRP and IL-6 [26].
Few studies have reported gender-stratified sleep associ-
ation with MetS. A meta-analysis of 12 cross-sectional and
3 cohort studies from North America, Europe, and Asia,
has found that both less than 5 h and greater than 8 h sleep
duration were associated with MetS but reported no gen-
der differences between the association [27]. Additionally,
a study in Korea reported that both short (less than or
equal to 5 h) and long (greater than or equal to 9 h) sleep
are related to increased risk of MetS, however, with gender
adjusted [28]. Other studies broadly categorized hours of
sleep into “short” and “long” and did not report the associ-
ation between hour-specific sleep duration and MetS. For
example, one cross-sectional study conducted in China
categorized sleep duration into 2- h intervals and found
that both short (less than 6 h) and long (greater than 9 h)
sleep was associated with MetS in males only [29]. Simi-
larly, a prospective study conducted in Korea has also used
2-h sleep intervals and reported that only short (less than
6 h) sleep was associated with MetS in a mixed gender
population [30]. Furthermore, while a recent meta-analysis
reported that a dose-response relationship exists between
short sleep and MetS, it did not support the notion that
long sleep is associated with MetS [31]. The opposite was
observed in a study conducted in Korea in which greater
than or equal to 9 h was associated with MetS but not with
sleep less than or equal to 5 h [32].
Although the biological mechanism of sleep duration
and MetS remains unclear, several potential endocrino-
logic, immunologic, and metabolic processes have been
reported. Sleeping less than 7 h may cause reciprocal
changes in circulating levels of leptin and ghrelin [33]
which would increase appetite, caloric intake, reduce en-
ergy expenditure [34] facilitating an increase in waist cir-
cumference as well as overall obesity development. It
may also cause impaired glycemic control (lowering glu-
cose tolerance and thyrotropin concentration levels) in-
creasing risk for hypertension and diabetes [35]. Other
endocrinologic effects include increased cortisol levels
which may elevate fasting glucose levels [36]. Addition-
ally, clinical studies have shown that sleep deprivation
results in increased levels of high-sensitivity CRP and
IL-6 during, markers that have also been associated with
constituents of MetS [37].
Likewise, number of studies report detrimental health
effects of long sleep [27, 38] and suggest sleeping in mod-
eration (approximately 7 h) rather than in abundance for
optimum health [39]. Potential effects of long sleep in-
clude: increased sleep fragmentation with lower sleep
quality [23], greater fatigue [40], limited photoperiod and
greater physiological deprivation (i.e. exercise) [23]. All of
these conditions are studied to be associated with insulin
resistance, dyslipidemia and hormonal imbalance [41]
which may lead to premature death [23, 39].
While the current study displays a correlation between
sleep duration and MetS, there are a couple factors to
consider. First, the current study is cross-sectional and
therefore, causality between sleep duration and MetS
cannot be construed. However, we’ve examined the asso-
ciation of baseline sleep duration with MetS incidence
through an incidence analysis among the HEXA-G sub-
jects who have completed the follow-up survey from
2012 to 2015 (54,504 subjects of which 18,522 men and
35,982 women). We found in both men and women who
sleep more than 10 h, there was a marginal increased
risk of MetS compared to those sleeping 6 to < 8 h (Haz-
ard Ratio (HR): 1.18, 95% CI: 0.88–1.59 in men; HR:
1.19, 95% CI: 0.97–1.46 in women). Although not

Page 6 of 8
 statistically significant, a prospective cohort study design
with the total HEXA-G sample’s sleep duration and risk
of MetS are warranted to support these exploratory find-
ings.
Second, sleep
duration was assessed
through
self-report questionnaire instead of objective measures
via the use of an actigraph or polysomnography. There-
fore, it is important to note that ‘sleep duration’ may be
reflective of ‘time in bed’
, actual time spent asleep, or
even how much sleep one believes was attained [42].
Nevertheless, studies have reported that self-report sleep
has a moderate correlation (Pearson’s p = 0.31–0.47) to
objectively assessed time spent asleep [43, 44] and hence,
remains as a useful tool in large epidemiological studies.
Third, total sleep time measured may include both night-
time sleep as well as naptime. Daytime napping behavior
has been associated with lower sleep efficiency, shorter
sleep duration, and consequently cardiovascular risk fac-
tors [45]. Hence, it would be informative to make the dis-
tinction between naptime and nighttime to separately
assess their impact on health. Fourth, no comprehensive
data on sleep quality/disturbances was available for ana-
lysis. Studies have reported associations between sleep dis-
turbances and cardiovascular and metabolic disorders
[38], which point to the importance of including sleep
quality/disturbance to assess the effect of sleep on overall
health. Fifth, the covariates such as smoking, alcohol
drinking, and physical activity were included in the final
model as categorical variables. Given that smoking, alco-
hol drinking, and physical activity are studied to be
dose-dependent to health outcomes, there may be residual
confounding effect that is not accounted for. Additionally,
our study included menopausal status as a binary variable
and does not include information on women experiencing
menopausal transition, which has been studied to be a
contributing factor to sleep patterns in women [22].
Despite these limitations, the current study is the largest
study providing dose-response association between sleep
duration and metabolic syndrome and its components.
Using the HEXA-G database allowing for greater internal
validity as well as additional robust subgroup analyses: the
sample became more homogenous and the number of
women and men have almost doubled from the previous
study which gave more power to detect the associations
between sleep and MetS that were unnoticed before. Fur-
thermore, with the addition of extended HEXA study
years from 2009 to 2013, hour-specific dose-response as-
sociation was analyzed which highlighted the gender dif-
ferences in association between sleep and MetS.
Conclusions
In conclusion, after adjusting for covariates such as
sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, sleep duration
displayed an association with MetS and its components
among both men and women. Gender differences were
observed in regards to the effect of short and long sleep
and their association with MetS-men were affected more
by short sleep and women with long sleep. Further pro-
spective studies using multiple measurements of sleep
duration (i.e. sleep diaries and actigraphs) are warranted
to assess the casual relationship between sleep duration
and MetS and its components.
