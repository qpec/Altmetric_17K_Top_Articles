Summary
Background Repeated symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) affect 25% of people who use clean intermittent 
self-catheterisation (CISC) to empty their bladder. We aimed to determine the benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness 
of continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of recurrent UTIs in adult users of CISC.
Methods In this randomised, open-label, superiority trial, we enrolled participants from 51 UK National Health 
Service organisations. These participants were community-dwelling (as opposed to hospital inpatient) users of CISC 
with recurrent UTIs. We randomly allocated participants (1:1) to receive either antibiotic prophylaxis once daily 
(prophylaxis group) or no prophylaxis (control group) for 12 months by use of an internet-based system with permuted 
blocks of variable length. Trial and laboratory staff who assessed outcomes were masked to allocation but participants 
were aware of their treatment group. The primary outcome was the incidence of symptomatic, antibiotic-treated UTIs 
over 12 months. Participants who completed at least 6 months of follow-up were assumed to provide a reliable 
estimate of UTI incidence and were included in the analysis of the primary outcome. Change in antimicrobial 
resistance of urinary and faecal bacteria was monitored as a secondary outcome. The AnTIC trial is registered at 
ISRCTN, number 67145101; and EudraCT, number 2013-002556-32.
Findings Between Nov 25, 2013, and Jan 29, 2016, we screened 1743 adult users of CISC for eligibility, of whom 
404 (23%) participants were enrolled between Nov 26, 2013, and Jan 31, 2016. Of these 404 participants, 203 (50%) were 
allocated to receive prophylaxis and 201 (50%) to receive no prophylaxis. 1339 participants were excluded before 
randomisation. The primary analysis included 181 (89%) adults allocated to the prophylaxis group and 180 (90%) adults 
in the no prophylaxis (control) group. 22 participants in the prophylaxis group and 21 participants in the control 
group were not included in the primary analysis because they were missing follow-up data before 6 months. The 
incidence of symptomatic antibiotic-treated UTIs over 12 months was 1·3 cases per person-year (95% CI 1·1–1·6) in 
the prophylaxis group and 2·6 (2·3–2·9) in the control group, giving an incidence rate ratio of 0⋅52 (0⋅44–0⋅61; 
p<0⋅0001), indicating a 48% reduction in UTI frequency after treatment with prophylaxis. Use of prophylaxis was 
well tolerated: we recorded 22 minor adverse events in the prophylaxis group related to antibiotic prophylaxis during 
the study, predominantly gastrointestinal disturbance (six participants), skin rash (six participants), and candidal 
infection (four participants). However, resistance against the antibiotics used for UTI treatment was more frequent in 
urinary isolates from the prophylaxis group than in those from the control group at 9–12 months of trial participation 
(nitrofurantoin 12 [24%] of 51 participants from the prophylaxis group vs six [9%] of 64 participants from the control 
group with at least one isolate; p=0⋅038), trimethoprim (34 [67%] of 51 vs 21 [33%] of 64; p=0⋅0003), and co-trimoxazole 
(26 [53%] of 49 vs 15 [24%] of 62; p=0⋅002).
Interpretation Continuous antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in reducing UTI frequency in CISC users with recurrent 
UTIs, and it is well tolerated in these individuals. However, increased resistance of urinary bacteria is a concern that 
requires surveillance if prophylaxis is started.

Introduction
Cohort studies from Europe and North America show 
that people who use clean intermittent self-catheterisation 
(CISC) to empty their bladders, possibly due to 
neurological disease such as multiple sclerosis or failure 
of urinary sphincter relaxation, have an average 
prevalence of repeated symptomatic urinary tract 
infections (UTIs) of 25%.1 Factors that could increase the 
risk of UTIs include being female, having neurological 
bladder dysfunction, and having bacterial colonisation of 
the urine.2 Prevention of UTIs with continuous low-dose 
antibiotic prophylaxis has been tested in five previous

trials involving 363 participants that were summarised in 
a Cochrane review.3 Results were inconsistent, showing 
no difference in three trials and a benefit in two trials. We 
repeated this Cochrane search of the medical literature 
with a later end date of November, 2017, but we did not 
identify any further reports.
The main potential harm of prophylaxis is the 
development of antimicrobial resistance by urinary 
pathogens, which would make it more difficult to treat 
infections and would be a public health concern.4 
Resistance to antibiotics was examined in two of the 
trials of the Cochrane review, but this review found no 
difference in antimicrobial resistance between prophylaxis 
and placebo groups in adults who were admitted to 
hospital with spinal injury.5 Increased antimicrobial 
resistance was found in urinary isolates from children 
with neural tube defects who were receiving prophylaxis 
compared with those who had stopped routine 
prophylaxis.6,7
Data8 from National Health Service (NHS) England 
showed that 71 million CISC catheters were prescribed 
for adult use in 2016. Assuming a use of four catheters 
per person per day,9 these data imply a prevalence of 
74 people who use catheters per 100 000 people, which is 
similar to the prevalence observed in France (62 users 
per 100 000 people).10 Although precise data are 
unavailable, the prevalence of repeated UTIs that is 
associated with CISC use is likely to be similar in other 
countries with sufficient health-care resources.
We aimed to determine the clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of continuous low-dose antibiotic 
prophylaxis in reducing the frequency of UTIs over 
12 months in adult users of CISC.
Methods
Study design and participants
We did a randomised, open-label, parallel group, 
superiority trial, in which we recruited participants from 
51 NHS organisations (hospitals, clinics, and community 
care providers) and treated them in the community. 
Participants self-medicated at home.
Local research staff at sites screened established adult 
users of CISC who were anticipated to continue CISC 
use for at least 12 months for participation in the trial. 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
People who need to perform clean intermittent 
self-catheterisation (CISC) to empty their dysfunctional urinary 
bladders are known to be at high risk of repeated symptomatic 
urinary tract infections (UTIs); an average prevalence of UTIs of 
25% in these people has been estimated in European and North 
American cohort studies. These infections exacerbate their 
existing poor health. One possible intervention to reduce UTI 
frequency is the use of continuous low-dose antibiotic 
prophylaxis, which appears to be effective for women with 
normal functioning bladders who have repeated UTIs. 
A Cochrane systematic literature review up to September, 
2011, identified five small trials that enrolled specific groups of 
CISC users. The three trials that involved children and the 
two trials that involved patients with recent spinal injuries 
showed inconsistent findings for UTI prevention and provided 
limited evidence of effectiveness of continuous antibiotic 
prophylaxis. We did an updated search from August, 2011, to 
November, 2017, and identified no further relevant trials. As in 
the Cochrane review, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, 
ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry 
Program, and the UK Clinical Research Network for papers 
published between Sept 18, 2011, and Nov 30, 2017. The search 
terms used were “(design.rct* or design.cct*) AND ({intvent.
mech.cath*}”, “{intvent.mech.device*}”, “{intvent.mech.
sheaths.}”, “{intvent.prevent.antibiotics*}”, “{intvent.prevent.
antinfect.*}”, “{intvent.prevent.cath*}”, “{intvent.prevent.
cleaning fluids*}”, “{intvent.prevent.surg*}”, “{intvent.surg.
intraoperativemanagement*}”, “{intvent.surg.postsurgman*}”, 
“{intvent.surg.presurgman*.}”, and “{intvent.surg.
urethrotomy.})”. We used no language restrictions in our search.
Added value of this study
We provide clear evidence from a robustly planned and 
conducted randomised controlled trial that antibiotic 
prophylaxis is effective and potentially efficient for treatment 
of a wider population of adults who use CISC and have 
repeated UTIs, regardless of the cause of incomplete bladder 
emptying. The results give a precise estimate of the degree of 
benefit that this patient group can expect when they use this 
intervention. Additionally, we quantify the main drawback of 
this treatment: increased antimicrobial resistance of the 
bacteria that colonise urine, urinary pathogens, and the faecal 
microbiome.
Implications of all the available evidence
The results of our trial reflect similar findings in children to 
show that adult users of CISC with repeated UTIs, irrespective 
of the underlying cause of their bladder dysfunction and the 
presence of other risk factors for UTIs, are likely to benefit from 
use of antibiotic prophylaxis through reduced frequency of 
UTIs during 12 months of use. The disadvantage of this 
approach is that antimicrobial resistance of potential and 
active pathogens is likely to increase. The long-term 
implications of this intervention are uncertain, but increased 
pathogen resistance might make it more difficult to treat 
established infections in individuals, and increased resistance 
of bacteria that colonise urine and contribute to the faecal 
microbiome are a public health concern. The severity of 
individual patient distress from repeated UTIs and local threats 
from antimicrobial resistance should simultaneously be 
considered when appraising and implementing this evidence 
of benefit of treatment.

For the trial questionnaire and 
case report forms see https://
www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk/
programmes/hta/117201#
For study inclusion, participants had to have had either at 
least two episodes of symptomatic UTIs that were related 
to CISC within the past 12 months or at least one episode 
of UTI requiring hospital admission. Participants were 
excluded if they were unable to tolerate all three of the 
agents used for UTI prophylaxis in the trial and, if they 
were women, if they were intending to become pregnant 
or were pregnant or breastfeeding.
Participants were identified from health records and 
clinic visits and an outline of the trial was explained to 
them. Those who were interested in study participation 
were seen by local researchers, who discussed the trial 
and provided written information, and those who decided 
to participate provided written consent for the 12-month 
trial period and, if willing, consent for additional follow-
up at 18 months. They provided data (on demongraphics, 
CISC use, UTIs, and cause of lower urinary tract 
dysfunction) at baseline and were randomly allocated to 
groups at this stage. Participants who had given written 
informed consent and who were already taking antibiotic 
prophylaxis against UTIs were asked to stop and 
complete a 3-month period without prophylaxis before 
baseline assessment and randomisation. Ethical approval 
was given on Aug 1, 2013, by the NHS Research Ethics 
Service Committee North East (Sunderland; 13/NE/0196). 
The trial protocol has been published.11
Randomisation and masking
Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive 
either antibiotic prophylaxis (experimental) or no 
prophylaxis (control). Randomisation was done centrally 
by an internet-based system that used permuted random 
blocks of variable length (two, four, and six). A statistician 
that was not otherwise involved with the study produced 
the final allocation schedule, including stratification by 
three variables: previous frequency of UTIs (less than 
four episodes per year vs at least four episodes per year), 
a diagnosis of neurological dysfunction of the lower 
urinary tract, and sex. Clinical trial unit staff and central 
laboratory staff who were assessing outcomes were 
masked to allocation. By necessity, participants, treating 
clinicians, and local research staff were masked to block 
size but not to allocation. For those allocated to 
prophylaxis, the clinician started the patient on a study 
drug for UTI prophylaxis that was suitable to the 
individual. The drugs given were 50 mg nitrofurantoin, 
100 mg trimethoprim, or 250 mg cefalexin. These drugs 
were prescribed to be taken once daily and were supplied 
by the standard NHS mechanisms and manufacturers 
licensed by the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products 
Regulatory Agency.
Procedures
Participants were scheduled to be reviewed in person or 
by telephone at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after random-
isation by local research staff. At the 1-month review, we 
checked their tolerance of trial medication and their 
understanding of trial assessments. If necessary, an 
alternative antibiotic was substituted. At 3, 6, 9, and 
12 months, participants completed trial questionnaires 
and research staff completed a case report form. These 
forms collected outcome measures, adverse effects, 
and adherence to their allocated treatment. Additionally, 
participants submitted a specimen of urine that was 
taken during an asymptomatic period at the baseline and 
at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Participants also submitted a 
perianal swab at baseline and at 6 and 12 months, which 
they posted to the central trial laboratory (Department of 
Microbiology, Freeman Hospital, The Newcastle upon 
Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon 
Tyne, UK) in supplied, approved packaging. If 
participants had a UTI for which they had sought 
antibiotic treatment, they submitted a UTI report form to 
the central trial office and posted a urine specimen in a 
sterile 
universal 
containing 
18 
g/L 
boric 
acid 
(International Scientific Supplies, Bradford, UK) to the 
trial laboratory before starting antibiotic treatment.
At the end of the trial, participants were asked to 
discuss whether to continue, stop, or start prophylaxis 
with their clinician. Participants who had consented to 
further follow-up were sent a questionnaire regarding 
antibiotic use at 18 months after randomisation, and they 
were asked to post a further urine specimen that was 
taken while they were asymptomatic and a perianal swab 
to the trial laboratory.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was incidence of symptomatic, 
antibiotic-treated UTIs during the 12 months of trial 
participation. These UTIs were defined as the presence 
of at least one symptom from a prespecified list, 
including 
urinary 
symptoms, 
change 
in 
urine 
appearance, abdominal pain, difficulty in catheterisation, 
systemic infective symptoms, or increased limb spasticity 
(appendix), and the participant had to be taking a 
treatment course of antibiotics for their UTI. The results 
of the primary outcome were collected by participant 
completion of a UTI report form and of the 3-monthly 
trial questionnaire and completion of the 3-monthly case 
report form by local research staff. The three sources of 
data were centrally assessed by two members of the trial 
team (CB and AvW-M) who did not know the allocated 
group of each participant. The assessment was done with 
the protocol to decide attribution of weighting to give 
each datapoint. A third member (RP) arbitrated over 
discrepancies.
Secondary 
microbiological 
outcomes 
were 
the 
incidence of microbiologically confirmed symptomatic 
antibiotic-treated UTIs; incidence of asymptomatic 
bacteriuria; and change in the frequency of antimicrobial 
resistance of bacteria that were isolated from urine 
samples during UTIs and during asymptomatic periods 
and of Escherichia coli isolated from perianal swabs. 
Microbiological confirmation of UTIs was defined as a

significant positive culture from a urine sample that was 
posted to the central laboratory at the time of a reported 
UTI or, if no sample was received, a positive culture 
reported by a local laboratory. Asymptomatic bacteriuria 
was defined as a positive culture from urine specimens 
that were received by the central laboratory that were sent 
at 3-monthly intervals in asymptomatic periods. We only 
assessed antimicrobial resistance of bacteria that were 
isolated from urine during UTIs and asymptomatic 
periods and of E coli isolated from perianal swabs in 
specimens that were submitted to the central laboratory. 
The central laboratory was accredited to ISO15189 (the 
UK  representative of the International Organization for 
Standardization) and analyses were done in accordance 
with standards set by Public Health England and the 
European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility 
Testing.12 A significant positive urine culture was defined 
as the presence of up to two isolates of at least 
1 × 10⁴ colony forming units per mL.13
Secondary clinical outcomes included the incidence of 
febrile UTIs over 12 months; hospital admission due to 
UTIs over 12 months; overall satisfaction with allocated 
treatment strategy, which was assessed by the Treatment 
Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM)14 at 
12 months; the effect on health status, assessed by 
participant completion of the Medical Outcomes Short 
Form-36 item questionnaire (SF-36; version 2, 1-week 
recall version)15 at baseline, 6 and 12 months, and at the 
time of each UTI; kidney function, determined by change 
in estimated glomerular filtration rate, and liver function, 
determined by alanine transaminase concentration, from 
baseline to 12 months; and incidence of adverse events 
associated with prophylactic and treatment antibiotics 
over 12 months.
Cost-effectiveness from a health-care perspective was 
primarily assessed as the incremental cost per UTI 
avoided. Health-care costs were collected through 
3-monthly case report forms, which were completed by 
local research staff, and from a participant-completed 
health use questionnaire at 6 and 12 months. Additionally, 
we did cost-utility analyses to assess the incremental cost 
per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained using 
participant responses to the SF-36 questionnaire, which 
was completed at baseline, at 6 and 12 months, and at the 
time of a UTI. For the incremental cost per QALY 
estimates, utility values that indicated perceived health 
status between 0 (death) and 1 (perfect health) were 
calculated using an established mapping algorithm to the 
SF-6D.16 Finally, a cost-benefit analysis was done by use of 
a bespoke questionnaire regarding their willingness-to-
pay to avoid UTIs, which was administered to participants 
after completion of the 12-month study period.
Statistical analysis
We considered a 20% reduction in average UTI frequency 
from three to 2⋅4 episodes per year to represent the 
minimal clinically important difference. Use of the 
Poisson rate test (for the primary analysis) required 
158 participants in each group (316 in total) to complete the 
study, giving 90% power at the 5% significance level for 
detection of superiority of prophylaxis over no prophylaxis, 
which we increased to 372 to allow 15% attrition.
The primary measure of effect was the relative 
difference in the incidence of symptomatic, antibiotic-
treated UTIs between the two groups during the 
12-month observation period. All participants who 
completed at least 6 months of follow-up were included 
in the modified intention-to-treat analysis, to report the 
comparative UTI incidence between groups, which we 
calculated as the incidence rate ratio (IRR) to allow for 
differing durations of follow-up.
The incidence of resistance over time to oral antibiotics 
that are commonly used against UTIs—amoxicillin, 
cefalexin, ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, co-amoxiclav, 
mecillinam, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim—were 
summarised graphically by group. A χ² test was used to 
compare bacterial resistance rates between prophylaxis 
and control groups by examination of all isolates from 
surveillance urine specimens collected between 9 and 
12 months and in strains of E coli isolated from perianal 
swabs between 6 and 12 months. Tests for trend of 
change in antimicrobial resistance were done separately 
for each group for isolates from surveillance urine.
Univariate analysis of change in kidney and liver 
function was done with a two-sample t test with additional 
analysis of covariance that used the covariates identified 
during the primary outcome modelling.
Prespecified additional analyses of the primary outcome 
were done to check the robustness of the primary result. 
These included not counting days participants spent 
taking treatment antibiotics for UTIs in the exposure time. 
Additional prespecified analyses associated with the 
primary outcome were done by the addition of an 
interaction term to the model, to explore subgroup effects 
(less than four vs at least four episodes per year) of UTIs at 
baseline. Additional modelling of the primary analysis 
adjusted the IRR for the effects of covariates, including 
stratification factors and other possible risk factors for 
UTIs (age, functional cause of poor bladder emptying, type 
of catheter, daily frequency of CISC use, use of prophylaxis 
in previous 12 months, kidney dysfunction, and presence 
of asymptomatic bacteriuria at baseline), in a manner 
analogous to the primary analysis. We also did a sensitivity 
analysis of the primary outcome by use of negative 
binomial regression and a strict intention-to-treat 
definition (appendix). Analyses were done in STATA 
version 14. The study was overseen by independent trial 
steering and data monitoring committees. The AnTIC trial 
is registered at ISRCTN, number 67145101; and EudraCT, 
number 2013-002556-32.

Results
Between Nov 25, 2013, and Jan 29, 2016, we screened 
1743 patients for inclusion in the trial. Between 
Nov 26, 2013, and Jan 29, 2016, 404 participants were 
randomly allocated to groups: 203 (50%) participants were 
allocated to the prophylaxis group and 201 (50%) to the 
no prophylaxis (control) group (figure 1). 1339 participants 
were excluded before randomisation. We included 
361 (89%) participants in the primary analysis, 
comprising 181 (89%) participants from the prophylaxis 
group and 180 (90%) participants from the control 
group. 22 participants in the prophylaxis group and 
21 participants in the control group were not included in 
the primary analysis because they were missing follow-
up data before 6 months. 34 (17%) participants in the 
prophylaxis group stopped taking antibiotic prophylaxis 
during 
the 
12-month 
observation 
period 
and 
26 (13%) participants allocated to receive no prophylaxis 
started antibiotic prophylaxis during the 12-month 
observation period. Of the 34 who stopped prophylaxis, 
23 (68%) were in the first 6 months. Of the 26 who 
started prophylaxis in the no prophylaxis group, 17 (65%) 
were in the first 6 months. Participants who were given 
the treatment of the other group were included in the 
primary analysis, if otherwise eligible, and they were 
evaluated by their original allocation. The most common 
reasons for patient withdrawal during the first 12 months 
were unwillingness to continue with the study, 
unwillingness to continue as a result of comorbidities, 
and study burden being too great. Participant 
characteristics were similar between the groups at 
baseline (table 1). At 12 months, 77 (78%) of 
99 participants allocated to prophylaxis who expressed a 
preference stated that they wished to continue to receive 
prophylaxis; in the control group, 83 (80%) of 
104 participants stated that they wished to continue 
without prophylaxis.
During the 12-month study, the incidence of 
symptomatic antibiotic-treated UTIs in the prophylaxis 
group was 1·3 cases per person-year (95% CI 1·1–1·6) 
and 2·6 cases per person-year (2·3–2·9) for no 
prophylaxis (table 2). The IRR, which accounted for 
differing durations of follow-up, was 0⋅52 (95% CI 
0⋅44–0⋅61; p<0⋅0001) in favour of prophylaxis, which 
indicated a 48% reduction in the incidence of UTIs 
associated with prophylaxis treatment. The median 
number 
of 
symptomatic, 
antibiotic-treated 
UTIs 
observed over 12 months was 1 (IQR 0–2) in the 
prophylaxis group and 2 (1–4) in the control group. In the 
prophylaxis group, 13 (10%) of 129 UTI reports stated 
that previously prescribed antibiotics (self-start therapy) 
were used for treatment compared with 57 (19%) of 
299 reports in the no prophylaxis group.
The microbiologically confirmed incidence of UTIs 
was 0⋅74 cases per person-year (95% CI 0·58–0·94) in 
the prophylaxis group and 1⋅5 cases per person-year 
(1·3–1·8) in the no prophylaxis group, giving an IRR of

least one positive 3-monthly surveillance urine culture 
that indicated a period of asymptomatic bacteriuria, and 
the incidence of asymp 
tomatic bacteriuria did not differ 
between groups.
At baseline, the groups did not differ in frequency of 
antimicrobial resistance of urinary isolates to eight oral 
antibiotics that are commonly used for UTI treatment. 
During the 12-month trial, resistance appeared more 
common in isolates that were cultured from urine 
submitted during symptomatic UTIs by participants in 
the prophylaxis group than those in the control group 
(figure 2). In urine samples submitted during 
asymptomatic periods between months 9 and 12 of 
the trial, resistance to nitrofurantoin (12 [24%] of 
51 participants with at least one isolate from the 
prophylaxis group vs six [9%] of 64 participants with at 
least one isolate from the control group; p=0⋅038), 
trimethoprim (34 [67%] of 51 participants vs 21 [33%] of 
64 participants; p=0⋅0003), and co-trimoxazole (26 [53%] 
of 49 participants vs 15 [24%] of 62 participants; p=0⋅002) 
was significantly more frequent in the prophylaxis 
group than the control group. Over baseline and 
subsequent 3-monthly intervals during the 12-month 
trial period, resistance to amoxicillin (38 [52%] of 
73 participants, 25 [74%] of 34 participants, 31 [82%] of 
38 participants, 32 [74%] of 43 participants, and 37 [76%] 
of 49 participants; p=0⋅004), cephalexin (11 [14%] of 
78 participants, ten [25%] of 40 participants, 13 [32%] 
of 41 participants, 17 [38%] of 45 participants, and 16 [31%] 
of 51 participants; p=0⋅005), co-trimoxazole (18 [25%] of 
73 participants, 23 [59%] of 39 participants, 14 [37%] 
of 38 participants, 21 [48%] of 44 participants, 26 [53%] of 
49 participants; p=0⋅006), and trimethoprim (32 [42%] 
of 77 participants, 31 [79%] of 39 participants, 25 [63%] of 
40 participants, 27 [63%] of 43 participants, 34 [67%] 
of 51 participants; p=0⋅016) also significantly increased in 
isolates from urine specimens that were submitted 
during asymptomatic periods by participants in the 
prophylaxis group. There was no evidence of increasing 
resistance over time in the control group. Resistance of 
urinary isolates that were submitted during asymptomatic 
periods appeared to decrease at 18 months. There was no 
evidence that E coli isolated from perianal swabs of 
participants in the prophylaxis group had significantly 
more frequent resistance against any of the eight 
antibiotics tested than did participants in the control 
group at 6–12 months of the trial. 
15 participants in the prophylaxis group (incidence 
0⋅11 cases per person-year [95% CI 0·06–0·21]) and 22 in 
the control group (0⋅16 cases per person-year [0·10–0·25]) 
had at least one febrile UTI, giving an IRR of 0⋅71 
(95% CI 0⋅40–1⋅26; p=0·24; table 2). Six participants in 
the prophylaxis group and eight participants in the 
control group were admitted to hospital due to UTIs.

With the TSQM questionnaire, participants allocated to 
prophylaxis self-rated as being satisfied with their 
treatment (appendix) giving a mean overall score of 73⋅8 
(SD 25⋅4; the range of scores for the TSMQ is 0–100). 
Health status, which was measured by participant 
completion of the SF-36 at 6 and 12 months, showed a 
small but significant improvement in the mental 
component score at 6 months but not at 12 months for 
participants using prophylaxis compared with no 
prophylaxis. Physical component scores did not differ 
between groups at 6 or 12 months. Responses to the SF-
36 (which was completed by participants during UTIs) 
were used to generate utility values,16 which showed a 
small, non-significant decrease in both groups compared 
with baseline (appendix). There was no deterioration in 
kidney or liver function in either group (appendix).
Economic evaluation suggested that, on average, a 
strategy of antibiotic prophylaxis was more effective and 
more costly than no prophylaxis. The incremental cost 
was £99 per UTI avoided (table 3). There was a 
60% chance that prophylaxis would be cost-effective 
should society be willing to pay £200 to avoid a UTI. The 
incremental cost per QALY over 12 months was 
£5059 (as determined by the cost-utility analysis). In the 
probabilistic analysis, the likelihood that use of 
prophylaxis would be considered cost-effective at a 
threshold value of £20 000 per QALY was 64%. 
Adjustment for utility values that were recorded at the 
time of UTI gave similar results. A probabilistic 
sensitivity evaluation from the willingness to pay analysis 
suggested that use of prophylaxis has a 66% chance of 
being considered more efficient and would give a higher 
net benefit than a no prophylaxis strategy if society was 
prepared to pay £200 or more to avoid a UTI.
19 (9%) participants in the prophylaxis group reported 
22 non-serious adverse events due to antibiotic 
prophylaxis (table 4) and 13 (6%) of these 19 participants 
changed their originally selected agent or stopped 
prophylaxis during the 12-month trial. The incidence of 
adverse events with all three drugs used for prophylaxis 
was similar. At each of the 3-monthly reviews, less than 
10% of participants in the prophylaxis group perceived 
adverse effects to be due to the use of prophylactic 
antibiotics. At the time of UTI, 28 (14%) of 203 participants 
in the prophylaxis group reported ever having adverse 
events due to treatment antibiotics versus 60 (30%) 
of 201 participants in the no prophylaxis group—
predominately nausea (20 [10%] of 203 vs 38 [19%] of 201), 
diarrhoea (13 [6%] of 203 vs 31 [15%] of 201), and candida 
infection (ten [5%] of 203 vs 19 [10%] of 201). The low 
numbers of adverse events in each category precluded 
statistical analysis.
The conclusion of the primary analysis was unchanged 
when removing duration of antibiotic course for UTI 
treatment from the evaluation (IRR 0⋅50; 95% CI 
0⋅43–0⋅58). This result was also unaffected by inclusion 
of the stratification factors (sex, previous frequency of 
UTIs, neurological bladder dysfunction) and other 
possible confounders (age, functional cause of poor 
bladder emptying, use of non-hydrophilic catheter, 
frequency of CISC, use of prophylaxis in previous 
12 months, kidney function, and baseline bacteriuria) in 
the model. Sensitivity analyses for the primary outcome 
that used negative binomial regression with a strict 
intention-to-treat definition gave very similar results 
(negative binomial regression: IRR 0·52, 95% CI 
0·42–0·65; p<0·0001; strict-intention-to-treat analysis: 
0·53, 0·45–0·62; p<0·0001).
Discussion
This trial provides clear, robust evidence of the 
effectiveness of continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis 
as a preventive strategy against repeated UTIs for adults 
using CISC who have recurrent UTIs, which we showed 
over 12 months with three drugs that are licensed in 
the UK. The lower 95% confidence limit for the risk 
reduction (39%) in the primary outcome surpassed our 
prespecified minimal clinically important difference (20%). 
This confidence limit was also greater than that seen in a 
previous study6 of children. The benefits of prophylaxis 
were valued by participants in the prophylaxis group, who 
were satisfied with treatment and most of whom elected 
to continue prophylaxis long-term. However, the 
measured health status of participants was not improved 
from the impaired values at baseline in either group.
Increased development of antimicrobial resistance 
over the 12-month trial duration in the prophylaxis group 
is a major concern that limits the appeal of the 
prophylaxis strategy. This finding was particularly evident

for drugs that were used for prophylaxis in the trial but 
was also seen for other antibiotics that are commonly 
prescribed for treatment of UTI. This finding was broadly 
consistent with a trial7 done in children.
This study was designed, conducted, analysed, and 
reported in accordance with best practice. We recruited 
participants from a diverse population of CISC users 
across a range of settings; however, our subsequent 
analyses found the effectiveness of prophylaxis to be 
consistent across clinical subgroups, which suggests 
generalisability across populations of adult users of CISC 
with similar characteristics in other countries, such as 
France and the Netherlands.7,17 Regarding study design, 
use of a remote computerised randomisation system 
ensured concealment of allocation sequence; all likely 
confounders were balanced across the two groups and 
their inclusion in the statistical model did not affect the 
primary result; participants, treating clinicians, and 
local research staff could not be masked to allocation, 
but outcome assessors were masked; and we chose 
participant-reported UTIs as the primary outcome, with 
a definition that reflected participant experience in terms 
of UTI symptoms and actions by clinicians to provide a 
treatment course of an appropriate antibiotic. We also 
included different opportunities for participant reporting 
of UTIs and for research staff to confirm episodes at 
scheduled visits. An absence of participant blinding and 
reliance on patient report could have risked differential

Data were not adjusted for missing data. (A) Data were calculated by use of the relative frequency of urinary tract infections from the primary outcome analysis. For the probability of cost-effectiveness, the pay 
threshold values for society’s willingness to pay are 1: £0; 2: £200; 3: £500; 4: £1000; and 5: £2000. (B) Data were calculated by use of utility values from participant completion of the Medical Outcomes Short 
Form-36 questionnaire. For the probability of cost-effectiveness, the pay threshold values for society’s willingness to pay are 1: £0, 2: £10 000, 3: £20 000, 4: £30 000, 5: £50 000. (C) Data were calculated by use of 
maximum willingness to pay to avoid one urinary tract infection and adjusted with the seemingly unrelated regression (sureg) function in STATA for estimation of costs and monetary benefits regressions. *Data 
are cost/outcomes or all observations. †Assessed by use of number of urinary tract infections, quality-adjusted life-years, and willingness to pay to avoid a urinary tract infection. ‡Value that participants would be

outcome reporting between groups. However, we believe 
that this possibility was unlikely because UTI reports 
were cross-checked against data from 3-monthly 
participant contact and validated against prespecified 
criteria. Similar findings between microbiologically 
confirmed UTIs and patient reports gave further 
reassurance that there was low detection bias. We did not 
assess the primary outcome in a small number of 
participants with less than 6 months’ follow-up. The 
number of participants who were excluded from the 
primary analysis were balanced across groups, and a 
sensitivity analysis showed that inclusion of all 
randomised participants did not significantly affect these 
conclusions.
More frequent patient contact and education given 
during the trial around non-antibiotic interventions to 
reduce risk and the effects of UTIs could have decreased 
the number of episodes of UTIs that prompted patients 
to request antibiotics. It is also possible that we did not 
capture all symptomatic, antibiotic-treated UTI episodes, 
although numbers of missed events are likely to be 
similar across the two groups.
Our confidence in the trial findings is reinforced by the 
low number of withdrawals and high number of patients 
who completed follow-up. All prespecified sample size 
thresholds for the primary analysis were met. The 
proportion and type of missing data was also similar 
between groups. Further, to provide a comprehensive 
assessment of the effect on antimicrobial resistance, 
we included collection and centralised analysis of 
urine samples obtained during UTIs (representing 
urinary pathogens) and during asymptomatic periods 
(representing urinary colonisers) and perianal swabs 
(representing the faecal microbiome). All samples used 
in the antimicrobial resistance analyses were processed 
with consistent methods by a single, accredited laboratory 
and resistance was detected in accordance with European 
standards.
A detailed economic evaluation was done as part of the 
trial, triangulating three methods: cost-effectiveness, 
cost-utility, and cost-benefit. All three methods suggested 
that the benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis was potentially 
worthwhile, incurring a modest extra health-care cost. 
Quantification of the degree and duration of the 
detrimental effect of UTIs on an individual’s wellbeing 
was problematic. We used a standard measure of health 
status; however, this did not show a significant decrease 
in health status during UTIs, and differences between 
groups over 12 months were small and unlikely to be 
socially significant. This difficulty measuring the effects 
of UTIs on health status was highlighted in a 2012 
review.18 The small differences in the SF-36 score that we 
found were less than the minimal clinically important 
difference that was defined in a previous study.19 This 
elevation did not account for the potential cost of 
development of antimicrobial resistance. This limitation 
might make an important difference to estimates of 
cost-effectiveness but, unfortunately, precise estimates of 
economic effects are not available.20
The effectiveness of continuous low-dose antibiotic 
prophylaxis against UTIs in users of CISC who had 
repeated episodes increases the number of patient 
groups with repeated or chronic infections who have 
been shown to benefit from this strategy. The increased 
frequency of antimicrobial resistance in potential urinary 
pathogens to antibiotics that are used for treatment of 
UTIs is a concern for individuals and for public health. 
Increased resistance occurred in the prophylaxis group 
despite reduced use of antibiotics to treat symptomatic 
UTIs. The mechanism by which low-dose antibiotic 
prophylaxis provides a benefit is uncertain. Our results 
show that episodes of symptomatic UTIs (indicating 
infection with urinary pathogens) are suppressed while 
the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (indicating 
urinary colonisation) was unchanged. It is possible that 
pathogenic bacterial strains with particular virulence 
factors are preferentially targeted by low-dose continuous 
therapy, or changes in the host response might be 
induced, allowing tolerance of colonisers but eradication 
of pathogens.21 Alternatively, bacteria colonising the 
bladder could be protected in specific niches that cannot 
be accessed by low urinary concentrations of antibiotic.
Evidence-based alternative ways of reducing the risk of 
UTIs and the severity of symptoms in women include 
non-antibiotic prophylaxis with methenamine hippurate22 
and vaginal oestrogen supplementation; however, neither 
has been tested for CISC users.23 Frequency of use of 
non-antibiotic preventative strategies was similar in both 
groups of this trial: increased fluid intake, increased 
frequency of catheterisation, and ingestion of cranberry 
products and probiotics were the most popular 
interventions (data not shown). Cranberry extracts, 
although often taken, do not appear effective in reducing 
the risk of UTIs in CISC users.24,25
An alternative antibiotic-based strategy is so-called self-
start therapy, whereby patients have a supply of 
antibiotics at home and can start a treatment course 
when their typical symptoms occur.26 In the present trial, 
participants in the control group reported self-start 
therapy to be the source of their treatment antibiotics 
more often than the prophylaxis group, but we cannot 
speculate further from these data as to whether this 
treatment option is a viable alternative to continuous 
prophylaxis in our trial population.
Striking a balance between clear benefit to the 
individual by use of antibiotic prophylaxis and the 
potential for long-term individual and societal harm 
from higher frequency of antimicrobial resistance is 
difficult for patients and clinicians alike. In many 
countries, prescribers and health-care organisations are 
encouraged to follow the principles of antibiotic 
stewardship, which include avoidance of long-term use 
of antibiotics particularly at sub-bactericidal dosage.27 For 
CISC users of both sexes who have repeated UTIs, there

do not appear to be any effective alternatives and the 
situation is further complicated by the high incidence of 
urinary bacterial colonisation (asymptomatic bacteriuria), 
which was unaffected by use of antibiotic prophylaxis; 
these findings are similar to those seen in children using 
CISC.7 It could be argued that our data show that the 
effect of repeated UTIs on patient wellbeing is low, 
showing few severe infections and little detriment to 
health status. However, a qualitative study nested within 
the trial revealed substantial distress that resulted from 
repeated UTI episodes among a relevant sample of 
participants,28 which is in agreement with a previous 
study29 of women seeking treatment for UTIs. Laboratory 
and clinical studies are required to understand better 
how continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis works to 
find ways of preserving benefit but minimising the effect 
on antimicrobial resistance. This balance is likely to 
involve careful study of genotypic and phenotypic 
switching of urinary bacteria from non-invasive 
colonisers to symptom-causing pathogens and the effects 
of host response in these changes.
Our data will help clinicians worldwide to provide 
more accurate information on the benefits and harms of 
antibiotic prophylaxis in this patient group. These data 
will aid more balanced decision making for CISC users 
who have repeated UTIs, considering the degree of 
individual patient distress and emerging threats from 
antimicrobial resistance.
