Abstract
The persistence of latent HIV proviruses in long-lived CD4+ T cells despite antiretroviral therapy 
(ART)1–3 is a major obstacle to viral eradication4–6. Because current candidate latency-reversing 
agents (LRAs) induce HIV transcription but fail to clear these cellular reservoirs,7–8 new 
approaches for killing these reactivated latent HIV reservoir cells are urgently needed. HIV latency 
depends upon transcriptional quiescence of the integrated provirus and circumvention of immune 
defense mechanisms4–6,9. These defenses include cell-intrinsic innate responses that use pattern-
recognition receptors (PRR) to detect viral pathogens and subsequently induce apoptosis of the 
infected cell10. Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) forms one class of pattern-recognition 
receptors that mediates apoptosis and elimination of infected cells after recognition of viral 
RNA11–14. Here we show that acitretin, an FDA-approved retinoic-acid derivative, enhances RIG-I 
signaling ex vivo, increases HIV transcription, and induces preferential apoptosis of HIV-infected 
cells. These effects are abrogated by RIG-I knockdown. Acitretin also decreases proviral DNA 
levels in CD4+ T cells from HIV-infected subjects on suppressive ART, an effect amplified by 
combination with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor. 
Pharmacologic enhancement of an innate cellular defense network could provide a means to 
eliminate reactivated cells in the latent HIV reservoir.

 Despite suppression of HIV replication by ART, HIV persists as latent proviruses in CD4+T 
cells, enabling viral rebound when ART is interrupted1–3. Latent proviruses produce little 
HIV RNA and protein expression and allow immune evasion. Ideal LRAs would reactivate 
latent proviruses without provoking broad T cell activation, enabling host cell killing by 
either viral cytopathic or immune responses. This is the basis for "shock-and-kill" 
therapeutic approach to eliminate the latent reservoir4–9. However, in clinical studies, SAHA 
used alone did not deplete reservoir cells even though it induced viral expression7. 
Moreover, when therapy is delayed, the latent reservoir contains mutations in the virus 
allowing for immune escape from cytotoxic T-lymphocytes8. Consequently, alternative 
killing strategies are needed9.
Cell-intrinsic innate immune defenses against viral infection involve pathogen detection 
through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Retinoic-acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) is a 
cytosolic PRR10–15 that can sense HIV-RNA16 and activate innate antiviral signaling leading 
to the death of infected cells17. However, HIV infection impedes RIG-I signaling by 
sequestration and degradation18,19,and RIG-I expression is lower in HIV patients20. RIG-I 
recognizes full-length HIV RNA more efficiently than short viral transcripts16 that 
predominate during latent infection2–6 thereby limiting RIG-I activity in patients on 
suppressive ART.
Retinoic acid (RA) induces RIG-I expression11 potentially arming innate immune 
defense21,22. RA also activates p300 acetyl transferase23–24, and could lead to stimulation of 
HIV transcription6. Acitretin is an FDA-approved RA derivative that has been used to treat 
HIV patients with psoriasis and is well-tolerated25,26. We hypothesized that acitretin could 
be used to increase HIV transcription and activate the RIG-I pathway to promote the 
preferential death of reactivated reservoir cells.
First, we assessed the effects of acitretin on viral expression from a latent HIV infected 
human T cell line (ACH-2)27. Treatment of ACH-2 with acitretin or SAHA for 72 hours 
increased HIV transcription (Fig. 1a). The effects of acitretin were partially blocked by 
curcumin, an inhibitor of p30028 (Fig. 1a). Acitretin also activated HIV RNA expression in 
latently infected CD4+T-cells from HIV+ subjects on suppressive ART (Fig. 1b).
Induction of HIV transcription alone may not clear HIV reservoirs4–9. Since acitretin 
induces RIG-I, and RIG-I signaling can eliminate virally infected cells10–15, we tested the 
ability of acitretin to promote clearance of HIV-infected cells in a primary T-cell model29. 
We used a single round viral construct GM-HIV containing a mutated gag gene 
(Supplementary Fig. 1) to infect unstimulated CD4+T-cells from healthy donors by 
spinoculation29,30 then treated cells with acitretin, SAHA, or DMSO. One day after 
treatment, both acitretin and SAHA induced HIV-RNA expression (Fig. 1c). Next, we 
examined whether the induction of HIV-RNA by acitretin was accompanied by p300 
induction. Indeed, 48 hours after acitretin treatment, p300 expression was increased in 
infected with GM-HIV more than in uninfected cells (Fig. 1d,e) and enhancement of p300-
association with RNA Pol II (Fig. 1f,g) was greater in HIV-infected CEM-T4 cells (a human 
lymphoblastoid T-cell line)14, than in uninfected cells. Furthermore, after 72 hours of

 treatment, acitretin significantly reduced cellular GM-HIV-DNA levels measured by real 
time PCR (Fig. 1h).
We next tested whether acitretin reduces HIV-DNA levels in samples from HIV+ subjects on 
ART. Treatment of CD4+T-cells from twelve ART-suppressed HIV+ subjects 
(Supplementary Table 1) with acitretin or acitretin plus SAHA for 7 days reduced HIV-DNA 
levels significantly more than treatment with DMSO, SAHA, or anti-CD3/anti-CD28 beads 
(Fig. 1i). The reduction was greatest when acitretin was combined with SAHA. This 
reduction in HIV-DNA concentration by acitretin was not due to expansion of uninfected 
cells (Supplementary Fig. 2). Thus, acitretin facilitates the reduction of HIV-DNA levels in 
CD4+T-cells from HIV+ subjects in vitro, an effect not seen with any candidate LRAs 
studied to date.
In other models, RIG-I limits viral infection by inducing apoptosis of infected cells13–15. To 
determine whether acitretin induces apoptosis in HIV-infected cells, we measured annexin-V 
staining and caspase-3 activity in GM-HIV-infected and uninfected CD4+T-cells after 72 
hours of treatment. Acitretin significantly increased the percentage of annexin-V+ cells (Fig. 
2a) and caspase-3 activity in the infected cells (Fig. 2b), consistent with reports that 
activation of RIG-I induces caspase-3-mediated apoptosis13.
To more directly assess whether acitretin induces apoptosis preferentially in HIV-infected 
cells and to test for potential synergistic activity with SAHA31, cells were infected with 
GFP-HIV29, and infected and uninfected cells were treated with acitretin, SAHA, or both. 
At 48 hours, acitretin and acitretin plus SAHA resulted in significantly higher levels of 
apoptosis in the GFP-positive cells than in the total cells or the GFP-negative cells (Fig. 
2c,d), indicating preferential induction of apoptosis in GFP-HIV infected cells. Furthermore, 
GFP-positive cells became significantly less frequent after treatment with acitretin or 
acitretin plus SAHA compared to SAHA or DMSO (Fig. 2e). These results are consistent 
with preferential induction of apoptosis in acitretin or acitretin + SAHA treated HIV-
expressing cells, leading to their elimination.
Next, we tested whether acitretin induces apoptosis in CD4+T-cells from HIV+ subjects on 
suppressive ART. Acitretin and acitretin plus SAHA each stimulated significantly higher 
levels of apoptosis than treatment with DMSO, SAHA, or medium. No difference was seen 
in uninfected cells from healthy controls. Meanwhile treatment with anti-CD3/anti-
CD28+IL2 led to high levels of apoptosis in cells from both HIV+ and healthy control 
participants (Fig. 2f,g). In contrast to anti-CD3/anti-CD28, acitretin did not upregulate the 
activation markers CD69 and HLA-DR on CD4+T-cells (Supplementary Fig. 2h). Kinetic 
studies showed that the induction of RNA expression occurred later with acitretin than with 
SAHA, and the acitretin-induced apoptosis was greater for any given HIV RNA level and 
time point compared to SAHA or DMSO (Supplementary Fig. 3). These results support the 
conclusion that acitretin preferentially reduces HIV containing cells by inducing apoptosis.
We examined whether depletion of cells harboring HIV-DNA and induction of apoptosis by 
acitretin was dependent on RIG-I signaling. Binding of viral RNA to RIG-I leads to a 
conformational change in RIG-I32 that enables binding to the mitochondrial antiviral

 signaling protein (MAVS)33 and phosphorylation of interferon-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) at 
serine 38634–37 culminating in type I interferon (IFN) induction and caspase-3 
activation10–15.To assess acetritin effects on RIG-I expression and signaling, we 
immunoblotted extracts from HIV infected and uninfected TZM-bl cells following 48 hours 
of treatment of acitretin, SAHA or DMSO with antibodies against RIG-I pathway proteins. 
Acitretin induces RIG-I in both infected and uninfected cells (Fig. 3a,b). However only in 
HIV-infected cells did acitretin significantly enhance MAVS, IRF3 and phosphoserine386-
IRF3 levels. Similar patterns were seen in latent GM-HIV infected CD4+T-cells (Fig. 3c,d). 
Acitretin treatment significantly increases MAVS binding to RIG-I33 in latently HIV 
infected CEM-T4 cells compared to uninfected cells (Fig. 3f,g). These observations suggest 
the initial induction of RIG-I and viral RNA by acitretin and subsequent RIG-I sensing of 
viral RNA12–15,32 promotes RIG-I association with MAVS38. RIG-I-induced apoptosis in 
virus-infected cells depends on the interaction of IRF-3 with BCL-2-associated X protein 
(BAX), triggering caspase-mediated apoptosis12–13. In the presence of acitretin, BAX 
expression was significantly increased, and pretreatment with a BAX inhibitor(V5) 
peptide39, but not a control peptide, diminished acitretin-induced apoptosis(Fig. 3a–e). 
These findings support a role for BAX-signaling in acitretin-induced apoptosis12–13.
Next, we measured type I IFN and CXCL10 chemokine production,18,33–37 following 72 
hours of acitretin treatment in GM-HIV-infected and uninfected primary CD4+T-cells. 
Acitretin, but not SAHA significantly increased IFN-β and CXCL10 secretion in infected, 
but not in uninfected cells (Fig. 3h). Similarly, IFN-β and CXCL10 levels in day 7 
supernatants of T-cell cultures from ART-suppressed HIV+ subjects were higher after 
treatment with acitretin or acitretin plus SAHA compared to DMSO or SAHA alone (Fig. 
3i). In contrast, no increased IFN-β or CXCL10 production was detected in acitretin or 
acitretin plus SAHA-treated cells from healthy volunteers (Fig. 3j). Acitretin produced dose-
related changes in both apoptosis and IFN-β or CXCL10 production in infected cells 
(Supplementary Fig. 4). Together, these results indicate that acitretin stimulates preferential 
RIG-I-mediated signaling in HIV-infected cells leading not only to apoptosis but also to type 
1 IFN and chemokine production. The release of interferon and subsequent action of 
interferon stimulated genes might promote the death of some uninfected bystander as well as 
infected cells explaining why the total number of dying cells is greater than the number of 
latently infected cells present (Fig. 2a–c,f).
Finally, to establish that the effects of acitretin treatment are mediated through RIG-I, 
shRNA was used to inhibit expression of RIG-I in CEM-T4 cells. RIG-I knockdown 
abrogated the induction of apoptosis, production of CXCL10 and IFN-β and reduction in 
HIV-DNA by acitretin treatment, but had no impact on the release of HIV virions in this 
latent infection model29 (Fig. 4a–f). These findings demonstrate the essential role of RIG-I 
in the observed acitretin effects. Further studies are needed to define the nature of HIV-
transcripts that bind and activate RIG-I10.
In summary, our data support a model (Fig. 4g) whereby acitretin, at clinically achievable 
concentrations40 increases HIV transcription, induces RIG-I expression, and augments RIG-
I signaling culminating in the preferential apoptotic death of the reactivated reservoir cells. 
Addition of LRAs like SAHA further enhances these effects of acitretin. Thus, one possible

 approach to induce the death of reservoir cells could be to use combinations of LRAs and 
acitretin to preferentially “shock and kill” CD4+ T-cells harboring HIV. This approach would 
likely eliminate cells producing both infectious and non-infectious forms of HIV.
Online Methods
Cell lines
CEM-T4 cells (HIV-negative, human CD4+, lymphoblastic cell line), TZM-bl cells (HIV-
negative, HeLa cell line with luciferase, beta-galactosidase reporters under control of the 
HIV promoter), and ACH2 cells (latent HIV T cell line derived from human T cells) were 
obtained through the NIH AIDS Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH 
(courtesy of Dr. J.P. Jacobs, Dr. John C. Kappes, Dr. Xiaoyun, Wu, and Dr. Thomas Folks, 
respectively).
Media and reagents
All T cells and T cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1600 supplemented with penicillin (50 U/
ml), streptomycin (50 µg/ml), L-glutamine (2 mM) (all from Life Technologies, Grand 
Island, NY), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) (from Sigma, St. Louis, MO). 
TZM-bl cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with the same additives as above. 
During cell culture post treatment or activation, 1 µM indinavir (IDV), 10 µM nevirapine 
(NVP), and 600 nM raltegravir (RAL) (NIH AIDS Reagent Program) were included to 
prevent spreading HIV infection. Working stocks of acitretin and SAHA were dissolved in 
DMSO (all from Sigma, St. Louis, MO). anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies beads 
(CD3/28) (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) were used at 1 bead per cell with human 
IL2 (Chiron, Emeryville, CA) at 10U/ml.
Cell culture and drug treatment
Cell treatment for both primary T-cells and cell lines was performed by resuspending cells at 
0.5 million cells per ml in complete RPMI with antiretroviral drugs as indicated above. 
TZM-bl cells were used by plating approximately 2×105 cells/ well of a 24 well tissue 
culture plate the day prior to infection. This results in approximately 75% cell confluence at 
time of infection and further testing. In general, test drugs were used at the following final 
concentrations: SAHA (350nM); acitretin (5 µM); equivalent DMSO (final DMSO 
concentration did not exceed 0.05%) input for negative control. Dose-response studies used 
acitretin varying from 1 to 25 µM using the DMSO (Final DMSO concentration did not 
exceed 0.25%) equivalent to the 25 µM of acitretin comparator. Cells were maintained in the 
same drug concentration throughout the duration of experiments ranging from 3 to 7days. 
Most assays employed acitretin at a fixed concentration of 5 µM (1650ng/ml). RAs are very 
lipophilic, so while serum concentrations peak at 500 to 700ng/ml, tissue concentrations 
measured in patients on established therapy reach levels of 16,000 ng/ml or approximately 
50 µM40. Thus the concentrations used in the current studies are clinically achievable.

 SpeI (1507) subcloning this region into the pcDNA3.1 TOPO TA vector (Life Technologies, 
Grand Island, NY). Using the Quikchange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, 
La Jolla CA), we mutated a region of gag from amino acids 1404 to 1432 (Supplementary 
Fig. 1 a). The sequence-verified mutated gag was re-cloned into pNL4-3 to make pGM-HIV. 
To generate GM-HIV capable of only a single round of infection, we co-transfected 293T 
cells with the pGM-HIV clone and a plasmid expressing wild-type gag (Supplementary Fig. 
1 a), only pGM-HIV plus gag expressing vector can produce p24 into supernatant 
(Supplementary Fig. 1 b). To confirm infectivity of GM-HIV, we first infected 0.5×106 
TZM-bl cells with 1 ng of p24 supernatant from pGM-HIV plus gag expression vector, the 
same volume of supernatant from pGM-HIV plus empty vector, and 1 ng of p24 of 
HIV-1(NL-4-3) as a positive control. After three days, HIV infectivity was measured by 
Bright-GloTM Luciferase assay system (Promega) and expressed as relative light units 
(RLU). Only supernatant from pGM-HIV plus gag expressing vector, and HIV-1(NL4-3) 
were able to infect TZM-bl cells (Supplementary Fig. 1 c). Next we infected PHA 
stimulated 1×10^6 CD4+T cells with 5ng of p24 in supernatant from pGM-HIV plus gag 
expressing vector, or an equal volume of supernatant from pGM-HIV plus empty vector by 
spinoculation at 2000 g for 2 hours29. The cells were washed with RPMI three times 
immediately after infection, and once the next day to remove all residual inoculum. 
Subsequently, the cells were cultured in RPMI with IL-2 (10u/ml), then GM-HIV DNA and 
RNA concentrations were measured in cellular RNA and DNA extracts by real-time PCR at 
day1 and day7. GM-HIV was only measurable in cells infected with supernatant from pGM-
HIV plus gag expression vector (Supplementary Fig. 1 d).
HIV+ participants on ART
All HIV-positive participants were on combination ART and had undetectable plasma viral 
loads (<50 copies mL−1) for at least 1 year (median 5 years) (Supplementary Table 1). They 
were recruited from SF VAMC Infectious Diseases Clinic to meet the predetermined number 
of study participants. The study was approved by the UCSF Committee on Human Research 
and the SF VAMC Human Subject Research subcommittee and all research participants gave 
written informed consent.
Isolation and culture of CD4 T cells from HIV-infected participants and healthy donors
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were purified from whole blood (HIV+, on ART) or 
PBMC eluted from leukoreduction filters (healthy donors) by density centrifugation. CD4 T 
lymphocytes were enriched by negative selection with the EasySep Human CD4 T-cell 
enrichment kit (Stemcell, Vancouver, BC). The purity of CD4 T cells was assessed by flow 
cytometry and was typically >95%. Cells were rested overnight before additional use.
In vitro infection of primary CD4+ Tcells with GM-HIV for a primary T-cell model of latent 
HIV infection29
Healthy donor CD4 T cells enriched by negative selection were cultured overnight, then 
treated according to the method of Lassen29by first infecting the unstimulated, resting CD4 
T cells with GM-HIV (5 ng p24/1×106 cells) by spinoculation at 2000 g for 2 hours. 
Uninfected controls underwent mock spinoculation. The cells were washed with RPMI three 
times immediately after infection, and once the next day to remove all residual inoculum.

 Following spinoculation of unstimulated CD4+Tcells, subsequently, the cells were cultured 
in RPMI for 10 days, integrated, latent proviral infection is established29. To confirm that the 
cells carried latent proviruses, we stimulated the cells with either PHA plus IL-2 or anti-
CD3/28-beads plus IL-2 for 48 hours then measured cellular GM-HIV RNA. Both PHA plus 
IL-2 (PHA+IL-2) and anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies beads plus IL-2(CD3/28+IL-2) 
treatment resulted in significantly increased cellular GM-HIV RNA compared to medium 
control (Supplementary Figure. 1 e).
Generation of latent GFP-HIV-infected CEM-T4 cells
A GFP reporter HIV construct (GFP-HIV)29 was transfected into 293T cells to produce 
GFP-HIV virions. CEM-T4 cells (1 × 106) were infected with 1000 pg of p24 for 5 hours, 
and unbound virus was removed by washing the cells three times with RPMI. Subsequently, 
the cells were cultured in medium with Saquinavir (5 µM) for 10 days to prevent spreading 
infection and allow for attrition of productively infected cells29. To study whether the cells 
have latent proviruses, we stimulated the cells with 5µM acitretin, 350nM SAHA, or 500nM 
prostratin for 72 hours, then harvested supernatant to measure the p24 production. Acitretin, 
SAHA, and prostratin all significantly increased p24 production compared to medium 
control, demonstrating that the cells contained proviruses that respond to LRA stimulation 
(Supplementary Fig. 3 a).
Assays for Apoptosis
The following assays were performed in duplicate with the EasyCyte6HT-2L flow cytometer 
(Millipore, Billerica, MA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions: (1) Guava ViaCount 
assay (Millipore, Billerica, MA) for absolute total cell counts and percentages of apoptotic 
cells. (2) Alexa Fluor 488 annexin V/Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit (Life Technologies, Grand 
Island, NY) to detect apoptosis for all experiments except those using GFP-HIV virus 
(50,000 cells per sample at each time point) (Fig. 1 and Fig. 3). (3) CellEvent Caspase-3/7 
Green Flow Cytometry Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) to detect caspase-3 
and caspase-7 activity (50,000 cells per sample) (Fig. 1). (4) Alexa Fluor 647 Annexin V 
(Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) to detect apoptosis in GFP-HIV-infected CEM-T4 
cells (100,000 cells per sample) (Fig. 2), since GFP would interfere with Alexa Fluor 488 
annexin V apoptosis and caspase 3/7-green flow cytometry assays.
Assay with BAX inhibitor-V5
Both GFP-HIV-infected and un-infected CEM-T4 cells prepared as described above under 
“Generation of latent GFP-HIV-infected CEM-T4 cells” were incubated with 200µM of 
either BAX-inhibitor-V5 or BAX-Inhibiting Peptide Negative Control (Millipore, Billerica, 
MA) for three hours, then treated with the following drugs (final concentrations): SAHA 
(350nM); Acitretin (5 µM); equivalent DMSO input. After treatment for 24 hours39, the cells 
were stained with Alexa Fluor 647 Annexin V (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) to 
detect apoptosis (100,000 cells per sample) using the EasyCyte6HT-2L flow cytometer 
(Millipore, Billerica, MA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

 ELISA assays for cytokine
Supernatants from GM-HIV-infected and uninfected CD4 T-cell cultures were collected 72 
hours after drug treatment and from HIV-positive or healthy donor CD4 T cells 7 days after 
drug treatment. The supernatants were analyzed with the following ELISAs: (1) Verikine 
Human IFN-β kit (BPL Assay Science, Piscataway, NJ), and (2) Human CXCL10/IP-10 kit 
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Assays were done according to the manufacturers’ 
protocols.
Immunoblot analysis (Western blots)
Cellular protein was extracted with the Mammalian Cell Lysis Kit (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 
separated on a 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), and transferred to 
an Immobilon-FL-PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membrane was blocked 
with Odyssey Blocking buffer and incubated overnight with 1:200 dilution of primary 
antibodies against RIG-I, p300, MAVS, IRF3, BAX, Pol-II, tubulin (all from Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), or p-IFR3 (phospho-Ser 386) (GeneTex, Irvine, CA). 
The membranes were then incubated with 1:15000 dilution of secondary antibodies: IRDye 
800CW (green) for RIG-I, MAVS, and IRF3, p-IRF3(ps386) and IRDye680 (red) for BAX, 
p300, Pol-II,and tubulin (all from LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). Finally, the western blot 
membranes were analyzed with the Odyssey CLx Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR, 
Lincoln, NE). Protein expression is represented as mean band intensity (INT) normalized to 
results for tubulin.
Co-immunoprecipitation assays (IP)with RIG-I or P300
30×106 of each cell sample were washed twice with cold PBS, and lysed using the 
Mammalian Cell Lysis kit (Sigma, MO). The lysates were centrifuged at 4°C for 10 minutes 
at 12,000× g to pellet cellular debris, and the clarified lysate was transferred to a fresh pre-
chilled tube. 20µl of lysates from each sample was saved for tubulin western blot to 
determine the amount of protein in the lysates. The remaining lysates were precleared by 
incubation with protein A/Sepharose for 1 hour at 4°C, subjected to immunoprecipitation 
with 2µg of anti-RIG-I polyclonal antibody (C-15), or 2µg of anti-p300 polyclonal antibody 
(C-20) overnight at 4°C, then treated with 50µl of protein G/Sepharose for 2 hours. The 
immunoprecipitates were washed 10 times with 1ml of cold wash buffer (1% NP-40, 1% 
triton-100, 50mM Tris-Cl(pH7.5), 1mM EDTA, 1mM EGTA, 0.27M Sucrose, 10mM 
Na4P2O7, 50mM NaF,1mM NaVO4, 0.1% 1-mercaptoethanol,1mM PMSF, 0.25M NaCl), 
then eluted from the protein G/Sepharose with 50µl of elution Buffer (1M Glycine 0.25M 
NaCl, pH2.8). The eluate was neutralized with 2µl of 1M Tris-Cl (pH9.5), then subjected 
to10% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. 
Membranes were treated with blocking buffer (Odyssey blocking buffer) for one hour then 
incubated overnight in blocking buffer with a either 1:200 dilution of anti-MAVS antibody 
(T-20) for RIG-I-immunoprecipitation or 1:200 dilution of anti RNA polymerase II (Pol II) 
antibody(F-12)) for p300-immunoprecipitation at 4°C. Detection was performed using 
1:15000 dilution of secondary antibodies: IRDye 800CW (green) for MAVS, and IRDye680 
(red) for Pol II for two hours. The bands were analyzed using Odyssey Infrared Imaging 
System (LI-COR, Nebraska).

 Preparation and evaluation of cells with attenuated RIG-I expression
CEM-T4 cells were transfected with either RIG-I-short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (h) plasmid 
(sc-61480-SH), or control-shRNA plasmid (sc-108083) (both from Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) using FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Roche, 
Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturers’ protocols. 72 hours after transfection, 
puromycin at 10µg/ml (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added to select for 
transfected cells for 7 days. Immunoblot analysis of protein prepared from both shRNA and 
control-plasmid transfected cells was performed to confirm RIG-I expression knockdown 
using anti-RIG-I (C-15). RIG-I-knockdown and control cells were infected with 1000 pg of 
p24 of HIV NL4-3 for 5 hours, and unbound virus was removed by washing the cells three 
times with RPMI. Subsequently, the cells were cultured in medium with Saquinavir (5 µM) 
for 7 days to prevent spreading infection and to permit a reversion to latency29.
RIG-I-shRNA and control plasmid-transfected cells were then each treated with acitretin (5 
µM) or the equivalent DMSO input (negative control) and maintained with antiretroviral 
drug cocktail of 1 µM indinavir (IDV), 10 µM nevirapine (NVP), and 600 nM raltegravir 
(RAL) for 7 days.
Measurement of intracellular HIV-1 RNA, DNA and HIV-1 RNA in supernatant
Total cellular RNA was extracted with the Rneasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). 
Genomic DNA was extracted with the DNA blood mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA 
and DNA concentrations were measured with an ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, 
Wilmington, DE). Supernatant HIV-1 RNA was extracted with the QIAamp Viral RNA mini 
kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). HIV RNA copy numbers were measured with a locked nucleic 
acid (LNA) Taqman assay. Briefly, we performed a single-tube, one-step assay in a total 
volume of 25 µl using the TaqMan RNA-to-CT-1STEP KIT (Life Technologies, Grand 
Island, NY), primers G19-2-F-7Y (AGCAGCYATGCAAATGTTA) and G-20-R 
(AGAGAACCAAGGGGAAGTGA) (400 nM each), and a dual-labeled fluorescent LNA 
probe (6-FAM/+C+C+ATCA+A+T+G+A+G+G+A/BHQ1) (200 nM); “+” in front of 
nucleotides indicates an LNA. Cycling conditions were 50°C for 30 min, 95°C for 5 min, 
and then 50 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec and 59°C for 1 min.
HIV DNA copy numbers were assessed with the same primer/probe combination and the 
TaqMan Gene Expression Master mix (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Results were 
expressed as averaged HIV-1 RNA or DNA copies per million CD4 equivalents for cellular 
nucleic acids and as RNA copies/ml for supernatant HIV RNA concentration. The limit of 
detection for all samples was 10 copies per million cells.
For quantification of GM-HIV RNA and DNA, the same primers and methods were used but 
with the following probe: 6-VIC/ AACGAAGTCAGTCGACCACACTCACTCTCAC/ 
BHQ1.

infected and uninfected CEM-T4 cells. Acitretin and acitretin plus SAHA increased 
apoptosis at 48 h in GFP-HIV-infected cells to a significantly greater extent than SAHA or 
DMSO alone (P <0.05) although both of these agents produced higher than expected levels 
of cell death in infected cells compared to uninfected cells. No differences were detected in 
uninfected CEM-T4 cells. (d) Percentage of apoptotic cells determined by annexin V 
staining of infected cells from (c) gated for the presence or absence of expression of GFP 
encoded by the reporter virus. Acitretin and acitretin plus SAHA increased apoptosis of

significant increases were induced by these agents in GFP negative cells (P < 0.05). (e) 
Percentage of GFP-positive cells after 7 d of treatment, as determined by flow cytometry of 
infected cells from (c). Both acitretin and acitretin plus SAHA reduced the number of GFP-
HIV-positive cells significantly more (P < 0.05) than treatment with SAHA or DMSO. (f) 
Average percentage of apoptotic cells determined by annexin V staining of CD4+ T cells 
from HIV+ subjects on ART (n = 12). After 7 d of treatment with acitretin and acitretin plus 
SAHA, the frequency of apoptotic cells was significantly increased in patient CD4+ T cells 
compared to DMSO, SAHA, or medium (P < 0.05). Apoptosis was also significantly 
increased following treatment with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies beads plus IL-2 
(CD3/28+IL-2) (P < 0.05). (g) Mean percentage of apoptotic cells determined by annexin V 
staining in cultures of CD4+ T cells from four healthy control subjects. Neither acitretin, nor 
acitretin plus SAHA induced higher levels of apoptosis than DMSO, SAHA, or medium at 
day 7 in these normal cells while increased apoptosis was observed when these normal cells 
were treated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies beads plus IL-2(CD3/28+IL-2) (P <

acitretin in uninfected TZM-bl cells and reached significant (P<0.05)(b), but in uninfected 
CD4+ T cells from the same donors this increase did not reach statistical significance when 
compared to the DMSO control(d). (e) Fold increases in annexin V positive, apoptotic cells 
in uninfected or HIV-infected CEM-T4 cells treated with acitretin or SAHA (versus DMSO) 
in the presence of the V5 peptide (a BAX inhibitor) or a control peptide. Note significant 
decreases in apoptosis production by the V5 peptide (a BAX inhibitor) in acitretin treated 
infected cells (P<0.05) but not in the other conditions. (f, g) Immunoblot analysis of co-
immunoprecipitation of protein extracts of CEM-T4 cells with or without latent GFP-HIV

in infected cells treated with acitretin. (g) The association of MAVS with RIG-I following 
acitretin treatment in (f, n = 4) was higher in GFP-HIV infected cells than in uninfected 
cells. (h) Fold increase over DMSO control in type 1 interferon (IFN-β) and CXCL10 
expression in supernatants from GM-HIV-infected, and uninfected CD4+ T cells 72 h after 
treatment. Acitretin increased IFN-β and CXCL10 levels to a greater extent than SAHA (P < 
0.05) in infected but not uninfected cells. (i) Fold increase over medium control of IRF3-
induced type 1 interferon (IFN-β) and CXCL10 expression in supernatants of cultures of 
CD4+ T cells from HIV+ subjects on ART (n = 12) on day 7 of treatment. Both acitretin and

Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of RIG-I expression markedly inhibits acitretin 
enhancement of apoptosis, induction of IFN-β and CXCL10 production and preferential 
depletion of HIV-DNA+ cells. CEM T4 cells were transfected with either RIG-I-shRNA 
plasmid DNA, or control-shRNA (scrambled shRNA) plasmid DNA, cultured for 72 h and 
then selected in the presence of puromycin (10µg/ml) for 7 d. Next, these cells were infected 
with HIV-NL43 and maintained for 7 d with antiviral drugs as previously described for the 
in vitro latency model. (a) Immunoblot analysis of RIG-I and tubulin after the puromycin

 selection, (b) the ratio of mean value intensities (INT) of RIG-I to tubulin from (a, n = 4), 
RIG-I shRNA transfection significantly reduced RIG-I expression (P<0.05).(c) Knockdown 
of RIG-I significantly diminished (P<0.05) acitretin induced apoptosis at day 7 post 
treatment compared to the scrambled shRNA control, and (d) significantly reduced (P<0.05) 
acitretin induced CXCL10 and IFN-β release and (e) significantly impaired acitretin-induced 
decreases in HIV-DNA levels (P<0.05). (f) Knockdown of RIG-I expression conversely had 
no significant impact on acitretin-stimulated release of HIV-RNA into supernatant at day 7, 
the fold increase of HIV copies in supernatant are from acitretin compared to DMSO control 
in both conditions. All values represent mean ± s.e.m. of triplicate samples (b,c,d,e,f) from 
three independent experiments. A student's t-Test was used to compare experimental 
conditions (b–f); **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05.
(g) Model depicting the preferential enhancement of RIG-I signaling by acitretin in latently 
infected HIV cells. Acitretin increases both RIG-I and HIV-RNA expression in the 
cytoplasm of latent HIV-infected cells; recognition of HIV-RNA by RIG-I initiates antiviral 
signaling. RIG-I–RIG-I interactions produce conformational changes that permit binding to 
MAVS, which leads in turn promotes IRF-3 activation. Activated IRF-3 activates two 
pathways: one inducing type I interferon (IFN) production and another resulting in the 
binding of BAX and activation of caspase-3-dependent apoptosis in the virally infected cell. 
These two pathways work together to protect the host against further spread of the pathogen.
