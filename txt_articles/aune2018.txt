Abstract
Background: Epidemiological studies on smoking and atrial fibrillation have been inconsistent, with some studies
showing a positive association while others have found no association. It is also unclear whether there is a dose–
response relationship between the number of cigarettes smoked or pack-years and the risk of atrial fibrillation.
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the association.
Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Methods: We searched the PubMed and Embase databases for studies of smoking and atrial fibrillation up to 20 July
2017. Prospective studies and nested case–control studies within cohort studies reporting adjusted relative risk esti-
mates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of atrial fibrillation associated with smoking were included. Summary relative
risks (95% CIs) were estimated using a random effects model.
Results: Twenty nine prospective studies (22 publications) were included. The summary relative risk was 1.32 (95% CI
1.12–1.56, I2¼ 84%, n ¼ 11 studies) for current smokers, 1.09 (95% CI 1.00–1.18, I2¼ 33%, n ¼ 9) for former smokers
and 1.21 (95% CI 1.12–1.31, I2¼ 80%, n ¼ 14) for ever smokers compared to never smokers. Comparing current versus
non-current smokers the summary relative risk was 1.33 (95% CI 1.14–1.56, I2¼ 78%, n ¼ 10). The summary relative risk
was 1.14 (95% CI 1.10–1.20, I2¼ 0%, n ¼ 3) per 10 cigarettes per day and 1.16 (95% CI 1.09–1.25, I2¼ 49%, n ¼ 2) per
10 pack-years and there was no evidence of a non-linear association for cigarettes per day, Pnon-linearity ¼ 0.17.
Conclusions: The current meta-analysis suggests that smoking is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in
a dose-dependent matter, but the association is weaker among former smokers compared to current smokers.

Introduction
Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of arrhyth-
mia and globally an estimated 5 million incident cases
occurred in 2010,1 and the prevalence has been esti-
mated at 33 million in 2015.2 The prevalence of atrial
fibrillation has been projected to increase 2.5-fold in the
next 50 years, partly due to an ageing population, but
also due to an increased incidence of the disease.3
Several meta-analyses have found positive associations
between a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation and the risk of
ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, sudden cardiac
death,
stroke,
peripheral
arterial
disease,
chronic
kidney disease and all-cause mortality.4,5 It has also

 been shown that patients with atrial fibrillation have
higher medical costs and lower quality of life6 than per-
sons without atrial fibrillation. In addition, coronary
artery disease patients with atrial fibrillation have a
higher risk of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular
disease overall compared to coronary artery disease
patients without atrial fibrillation.7
Established or suspected risk factors for atrial
fibrillation include age, heart failure, coronary heart
disease, hypertension, diabetes, obesity and elevated
resting heart rate.8–12 Several cohort studies have inves-
tigated the association between smoking and atrial
fibrillation8,13–33 and several of these have found a posi-
tive association;13–15,17–21,24–28,32 however, the results
have been inconsistent, with several studies finding no
clear association.8,16,22,23,27,29–31,33 Limited statistical
power in some studies and differences in the adjustment
for confounding factors and categorisation of smoking
(e.g. current vs. non-current compared to current vs.
never smokers) may have contributed to some of the
variation in the results. Although a previous meta-ana-
lysis found an increased risk of atrial fibrillation among
smokers34 the analysis did not investigate whether there
was a dose–response relationship between the increas-
ing number of cigarettes smoked or pack-years and
atrial fibrillation. In addition, twelve studies (6 publica-
tions) were either missed or excluded14,15,18,21,22,26 and
at least eight studies (seven publications)23,24,30–33,35
have since been published. We therefore conducted an
up-to-date meta-analysis of smoking and the risk of
atrial fibrillation to clarify the dose–response relation-
ship between smoking and atrial fibrillation and to
assess potential sources of heterogeneity in the results
including the impact of study characteristics such as
study quality and adjustment for confounding factors.
Materials and methods
Search strategy and inclusion criteria
We searched the Pubmed and Embase databases up to
20 July 2017 for eligible studies. The search terms are
found in the Supplementary material. We followed
standard criteria for reporting meta-analyses.36 In add-
ition, we searched the reference lists of the identified
publications for further studies. The search was con-
ducted by DA and SS.
Study selection
We included published prospective cohort studies and
nested case–control studies within cohorts that investi-
gated the association between smoking and the risk of
atrial fibrillation. Adjusted estimates of the relative risk
(RR) (including hazard ratios or incidence rate ratios)
had to be available with the 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) in the publication. A list of the excluded studies
and exclusion reasons can be found in Supplementary
Table 1.
Data extraction
The following data were extracted from each study:
the first author’s last name, publication year, country
where the study was conducted, study period, sample
size, number of cases and participants, smoking expos-
ure and subgroup, RRs and 95% CIs for smoking com-
pared to not smoking and variables adjusted for in the
analysis.
Statistical methods
We calculated summary RRs and 95% CIs of atrial
fibrillation by smoking status (current, former, or ever
vs. never smokers, or current vs. non-current smokers),
by cigarettes smoked per day and pack-years using the
random-effects model by DerSimonian and Laird,37
which takes into account both within and between-
study
variation
(heterogeneity).
Current
smokers
refers to smokers who smoked at the time of baseline
examination, former smokers refers to participants
who smoked previously, but not currently at baseline,
and ever smokers includes both current and former
smokers. The average of the natural logarithm of
the RRs was estimated and the RR from each study
was weighted using random effects weights. When
studies reported results stratified by sex or other sub-
groups but not for the overall population the RRs for
each subgroup were pooled using a fixed effects model
to obtain a RR for the overall study. Linear dose–
response analyses were conducted using the method
of Greenland and Longnecker,38 and study-specific
linear trends and 95% CIs were computed from the
natural log of the RRs and CIs across categories of
cigarettes per day and pack-years. The linear dose–
response analysis was conducted on a continuous
scale with an increment of 10 cigarettes smoked per
day and per 10 pack-years. For one study reporting
on cigarette-years and atrial fibrillation20 the data
were converted to pack-years by dividing the cigar-
ette-years by 20, as one pack of cigarettes contains
20 cigarettes. A potential non-linear association was
investigated using restricted cubic splines with three
knots at 10%, 50% and 90% percentiles of the distri-
bution, which was combined using multivariate meta-
analysis.39,40
Heterogeneity between studies was evaluated using
Q and I2 statistics.41 I2 is a measure of how much of the
heterogeneity is due to between-study variation rather
than chance. I2 values of 25%, 50% and 75% indicate

 low, moderate and high heterogeneity, respectively.
Subgroup analyses stratified by study characteristics
such as duration of follow-up, sex, geographical loca-
tion, number of cases, study quality and by adjustment
for confounding factors (age, alcohol, body mass
index, height, diabetes, hypertension, blood cholesterol,
prevalent coronary heart disease and physical activity)
to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity. Study
quality was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa scale,
which rates studies according to selection, comparabil-
ity and outcome assessment, with a score range from
0 to 9.42 Publication bias was assessed using Egger’s
test43 and Begg–Mazumdar’s test44 and by inspection
of funnel plots. The statistical analyses were conducted
using the software package Stata, version 13.1 software
(StataCorp, Texas, USA).
Results
We identified 29 cohort studies (22 publications)8,13–33
that were included in the meta-analysis (Figure 1,
Table 1). One publication included pooled data from
seven cohort studies,21 another publication included
data from five cohort studies,27 and one publication
reported on pooled data from two cohort studies com-
bined.31 Eighteen studies were from Europe, eight stu-
dies were from North America, two studies were from
Australia and one study was from Japan (Table 1).
Seventeen cohort studies (11 publications, 11 risk
estimates)8,14–19,21–24 were included in the analysis of
current smokers (9240 cases, 388,030 participants), 15 stu-
dies (nine publications, nine risk estimates)8,14,16–19,21,23,24
were included in the analysis of former smokers
(8508 cases, 372,229 participants) and 20 studies
(14 publications, 14 risk estimates)8,13–19,21,23,24,26,29,32
were included in the analysis of ever smokers (30,509
cases, 556,613 participants) compared to never smokers
and the risk of atrial fibrillation.
The summary RR was 1.32 (95% CI 1.12–1.56,
I2¼ 84%, Pheterogeneity < 0.0001) for current smokers
(Figure 2(a)), 1.09 (95% CI 1.00–1.18, I2¼ 33%,
Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.15) for former smokers (Figure 2(b))
and 1.21 (95% CI 1.12–1.31, I2¼ 80%, Pheterogeneity
< 0.0001) for ever smokers (Figure 2(c)). In 10 studies
(five publications, nine risk estimates)25,27,28,30,31 com-
paring current versus non-current smokers (10,355
cases, 159,748 participants) the summary RR was
1.33
(95%
CI
1.14–1.56,
I2¼ 78%,
Pheterogeneity
< 0.0001, n ¼ 10) (Figure 2(d)). The summary RR was
1.14 (95% CI 1.10–1.20, I2¼ 0%, Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.41,
n ¼ 3) per 10 cigarettes per day (Figure 3(a)) and
there was no evidence of a non-linear association,
Pnon-linearity ¼ 0.17
(Figure
3(b),
Supplementary
Table 2).17,18,24 The summary RRs were 1.09 (95%
CI 1.02–1.16), 1.17 (95% CI 1.05–1.30), 1.25 (95% CI
1.11–1.40),
1.32
(95%
CI
1.19–1.46),
1.39
(95%
CI 1.27–1.53) and 1.45 (95% CI 1.32–1.60) for 5, 10,
15, 20, 25 and 29 cigarettes per day compared to zero
cigarettes
per
day,
respectively
(Supplementary
Table 2). The summary RR was 1.16 (95% CI
1.09–1.25,
I2¼ 49%,
Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.16,
n ¼ 2)
per
10 pack-years (Figure 4).20,33 There was no evidence
of publication bias with Egger’s test or Begg’s test for
current (P ¼ 0.86 and P ¼ 0.64, respectively), former
(P ¼ 0.92 and P ¼ 0.92, respectively) and ever smokers
(P ¼ 0.39 and P ¼ 0.16, respectively), but in the analysis
of current versus non-current smokers there was some
evidence with Egger’s test, P ¼ 0.009, although not with
Begg’s test, P ¼ 0.47 (Supplementary Figures 1–4).
There was little variation in the summary RRs (95%
CIs) when excluding one study at a time in each ana-
lysis (Supplementary Figures 5–8).

 some, but not all, confounding factors (including age,
body mass index, physical activity, diabetes, coronary
heart disease) (Table 2). With meta-regression analyses
there was little evidence that the results differed
between most subgroups. In the subgroup analysis of
adjustment for alcohol there was an indication of het-
erogeneity for current (Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.07) and former
(Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.04) smokers, with positive associations
only observed among studies with no such adjustment.
For current smokers there was heterogeneity in the sub-
group analysis stratified by adjustment for coronary
heart disease (Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.01), with a stronger asso-
ciation among studies with such adjustment than
among studies without such adjustment.
The mean (median) study quality scores were 6.9
(7.0) for current smoking, 7.0 (7.0) for former smoking
and 6.9 (7.0) for ever smoking.
Discussion
This meta-analysis of prospective studies suggest that
current, former and ever smoking is associated with a
32%, 9% and 21% increased risk of developing atrial
fibrillation compared to never smokers. In addition, cur-
rent versus non-current smoking was associated with a
33% increase in the risk, and in dose–response analyses
smoking 10 cigarettes per day and 10 pack-years was
associated with 14% and 16% increases in the RR of
atrial fibrillation, respectively. There was a clear dose–
response relationship between the increasing number of
cigarettes smoked per day and the risk of atrial fibrilla-
tion and no evidence that the association was non-linear.
The strength of the association by smoking status is also
consistent with a dose–response relationship as the asso-
ciation was strongest for current smokers, intermediate

 for ever smokers (current and former smokers com-
bined) and lowest for former smokers.
The present systematic review and meta-analysis has
some limitations that need to be discussed. Smokers
tend to have a less healthy overall lifestyle than non-
smokers, with more abdominal obesity, less physical
activity, higher intake of alcohol and unhealthier diets
than non-smokers. We found that the results persisted
among studies that adjusted for adiposity and physical
activity (ever smokers), although no studies adjusted
for dietary factors; however, little is known about
the relationship between diet and atrial fibrillation.
There was some indication of heterogeneity by adjust-
ment for alcohol, with no association among the few
studies with such adjustment; however, further studies
are needed to clarify if this really is due to adjustment
for alcohol or if it is due to chance or a study-specific
effect because there were few studies with such adjust-
ment. Residual confounding by other risk factors than
those included in the multivariable models of the origi-
nal studies can also not be ruled out. Although tobacco
smoking was self-reported and there may be some
measurement errors in the assessment of tobacco smok-
ing, validation studies using urinary cotinine as a refer-
ence biomarker have shown high correlations between
self-reported smoking status and the biomarker.45,46
Misclassification of the outcome is also a possibility;
however, in several subgroup analyses we found no sig-
nificant heterogeneity in the results between studies that
used only hospital discharge linkages to identify cases
and studies that used multiple sources (self-report, hos-
pital or medical record linkage, electrocardiograms) to
identify the cases, with or without outcome adjudication
or validation.
There was high heterogeneity in the analysis of cur-
rent and ever smokers and there was some variation in
the results, with a few studies showing no clear relation
while others found 50–100% increases in the RR,
but we did not find a clear explanation for this hetero-
geneity in the subgroup analyses. It is possible that dif-
ferent intensities and durations of tobacco smoking
could contribute to such heterogeneity, which then
might not be captured by a simple analysis of only
smoking status. There was little or no heterogeneity
observed in the analysis of former smokers as well as
in the analysis of cigarettes per day, but there was also a
limited number of studies included in the dose–response
analysis. Further studies with more in-depth analyses of
number of cigarettes per day, duration, pack-years and
time since smoking cessation are needed. It is also pos-
sible that residual confounding by passive smoking
among the never smokers may have diluted an effect
of smoking on atrial fibrillation; however, no prospect-
ive data on passive smoking and atrial fibrillation were
available.
The dose–response relationship between smoking
and the risk of atrial fibrillation may suggest that
there is an underlying biological relationship that

 could explain the observed association. Tobacco smok-
ing increases the risk of diabetes,47 chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease,48 coronary heart disease48 and
heart
failure,49
which
are
risk
factors
for
atrial
fibrillation.27,50–52
Nicotine in cigarettes
stimulates
sympathetic neurotransmission increasing plasma cat-
echolamine concentrations53 and thereby leading to
increased resting heart rate, blood pressure54 and an
increased risk of hypertension,55–57 which again is asso-
ciated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation.12,58
Nicotine has also been shown to have direct effects on
atrial myocyte ion channel conduction, by blocking
outward Kþ current, which can lead to a delay of ven-
tricular repolarisation or prolongation of the effective
refractory period.59 Cigarette smoking has also been
associated with increased atrial fibrosis, which can
lead to atrial arrhythmias by slowing electrical impulse
conduction in cardiac tissue.60 A canine model found
that nicotine causes downregulation of micro RNAs in
atrial fibroblasts and upregulation of transforming
growth factors leading to increased collagen production
and atrial fibrosis.61
The current meta-analysis also has some strengths
including the prospective design of the included stu-
dies (which avoids or reduces biases that may affect
retrospective case–control studies such as recall bias
and selection bias), the detailed subgroup and sensi-
tivity analyses, the large sample size, as well as the
high study quality of the included studies. Our find-
ings have important clinical and public health impli-
cations as they provide evidence of a dose–response
relationship between the increasing number of cigar-
ettes smoked and the risk of atrial fibrillation, but also
evidence of a reduced risk among former smokers
compared to current smokers. The findings therefore
underscore
the
importance
of
avoiding
smoking
among non-smokers and smoking cessation among
current smokers to prevent atrial fibrillation, although
further studies are needed to quantify the duration
of cessation that is needed before risk is reduced,
and if the risk at some point reaches that of never
smokers.
Conclusion
This meta-analysis suggests that current, former and
ever smokers are at 32%, 9% and 21% increased risk
of atrial fibrillation compared to never smokers, and
that there is a dose-dependent association between
increasing number of cigarettes smoked and pack-
years and increased risk. Any further studies should
include analyses of the number of cigarettes smoked,
duration, pack-years and time since smoking cessation
in relation to atrial fibrillation and should adjust for
more confounding factors.
