Abstract
OA is a chronic and disabling joint disease with limited evidence-based pharmacological treatment op-
tions available that improve outcomes for patients safely. Faced with few effective pharmacological treat-
ments, the use has grown of dietary supplements and complementary medicines for symptomatic relief
among people living with OA. The aim of this review is to provide a summary of existing evidence and
recommendations supporting the use of supplements for OA. Systematic reviews and randomized con-
trolled trials investigating oral supplements for treating OA were identified. Limited research evidence
supports recommendations for the oral use of Boswellia serrata extract and Pycnogenol, curcumin and
methylsulfonylmethane in people with OA despite the poor quality of the available studies. Few studies
adequately reported possible adverse effects related to supplementation, although the products were
generally recognized as safe. Further high quality trials are needed to improve the strength of evidence
to support this recommendation and better guide optimal treatment of people living with OA.
Key words: osteoarthritis, supplements, self-management, treatment, recommendations, complementary medicines
Rheumatology key messages
. Limited evidence supports the use Boswellia serrata extract, Pycnogenol, curcumin and methylsulfonylmethane
for OA.
. Available evidence does not support some widely used supplements such as glucosamine and chondroitin
for OA.
. Current evidence for supplements in OA is limited by poor quality; well-designed robust trials are needed.
Introduction
OA is a progressive and dynamic joint disease and the
most common form of arthritis in middle-aged or older
adults worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of 9.6%
in men and 18% in women aged over 60 years [1]. The
incidence and prevalence of this disease are rising; the
global prevalence and years lived with disability of OA
increased from 140.5 and 7.3 million, respectively, in
1990 to 241.8 and 12.8 million, respectively, in 2013 [2].
This is likely related to the growth in the ageing population,
the escalating rates of obesity, and the increasingly seden-
tary lifestyles that are becoming pervasive in the modern
world [1, 3]. OA is characterized by cartilage and synovial
inflammation as well as major structural changes of the
whole joint leading to joint pain and swelling, disability
and deformity [4]. Treatments for this prevalent, disabling
and incurable condition aim to provide symptomatic relief.
Recent evidence has challenged the recommendation for
the ‘first-line’ medication of paracetamol and NSAIDs [5, 6].
Increasingly patients, particularly those with greater know-
ledge of their condition and better self-rated health status,
turn to the use of supplements and complementary and
alternative medicines due to their easy accessibility and
perceived favourable safety profile [7].
Dietary supplements, taken orally as a capsule, tablet or
liquid, contain one or more dietary ingredients (e.g. vita-
mins or botanicals) [8]. The supplements reported to
be most commonly used by Australian and American
patients
with
OA
include
omega-3
fatty
acids
(i.e.
fish/krill oil, etc.), glucosamine, chondroitin, Vitamins,

 methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) and herbal medicines (e.g.
turmeric) [7, 9]. There is a large amount of information
available on these products and active promotion of
them to consumers as supplements for treating OA,
most which is not evidence-based, in the form of ‘adver-
torials’ and testimonials. In addition, the information avail-
able to people living with OA that is disguised as the
results of so called scientific studies and presented in
the mainstream media is often false or misleading [10, 11].
Some people living with OA seek the advice of their
physician, friend or family to recommend the best supple-
ments for their condition. The supplements recommended
by physicians are variable and do appear to change over
time. For example, the recommendation of glucosamine
and/or chondroitin by Australian general practitioners
(GPs) to OA patients decreased from 39% in 2006 to
13% in 2013. This likely occurred as a result of GPs becom-
ing increasingly aware of their ineffectiveness through ex-
posure to clinical guidelines for management of OA [12].
However, the international recommendations highlight that
the use of glucosamine and/or chondroitin in OA remains
controversial [13�15]. Interestingly, a higher percentage of
GPs (6�13%) recommended fish oil and krill oil [12] for pa-
tients with OA despite there being little evidence of clinical
efficacy [16]. The discrepancies in international recommen-
dations and guidelines for the use of supplements in OA,
coupled with variations in clinical practice, make it very
difficult for practitioners to decide what to recommend to
their patients. Therefore, the aim of this article is to review
the best evidence available and propose recommendations
for the appropriate use of supplements and complementary
medicines in people living with OA.
Methods
Relevant clinical studies regarding the use of orally
administered supplements and complementary medicines
for OA were searched through PubMed from inception
to September 2017. We included supplements and
complementary medicines promoted for OA or commonly
used by people for OA management. The primary out-
comes of interest were pain and physical function.
Systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials
were reviewed.
In order to make a recommendation related to which
supplements or complementary medicines were appropri-
ate for use in people with OA, we attempted to identify the
estimated treatment effects of supplements. To facilitate
interpretation of estimated treatment effects calculated by
standardized mean difference (SMD), we considered
effect size (ES) up to 0.3 as small, between 0.3 and 0.8
as moderate, and >0.8 as large [17]. We used the thresh-
old of 0.37
S.D. as the minimum clinically important
difference [18]. This threshold is based on the median
minimum clinically important difference reported in stu-
dies in patients with OA. An ES of 0.37 corresponds to a
difference of 9 mm on a 100 mm visual analogue scale on
pain [19].
The
Grading
of
Recommendations
Assessment,
Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach provides
a system for rating quality of evidence and strength of
recommendations [20]. A bubble diagram with traffic
light system of the recommendations for the use of sup-
plements in OA was developed based on the pooled ES
and GRADE ratings (when available in current evidence)
for pain reduction and improvement in physical function.
A green light means recommended for use in OA; a yellow
light means that further measurement of outcomes is
required; and a red light means not recommended for
use. The size of the bubbles reflects the GRADE ratings,
which means the bigger the bubble, the higher the GRADE
ratings.
Results
Eight systematic reviews or meta-analyses and nine ran-
domized controlled trials (RCTs) of supplements and com-
plementary medicines were identified and 16 supplements
were included in this review. The research evidence for
the efficacy of the following supplements is summarized
in Table 1.
Marine omega-3 fatty acids
Marine oil supplements are thought to have analgesic ef-
fects due to high concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid
and docosahexaenoic acid [37]. However, the latest sys-
tematic review of marine oil including fish oil, krill oil and
green-lipped mussel (GLM) extracts for a duration of 6�26
weeks for arthritis pain suggested no effect in patients
with OA (five trials; SMD �0.17; 95% CI: �0.57, 0.24).
The quality of evidence was very low [16].
Fish oil
There are no systematic reviews or meta-analyses of
treatment with fish oil supplements in OA reported to
date. The first RCT was conducted in 1992 and suggested
no significant benefit for the patients taking cod liver oil
(10 ml daily containing 786 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid,
24 weeks) compared with those taking placebo (olive oil)
[21]. Hill et al. [22] conducted a well-designed, rigorous
2-year study to compare low dose omega-3 fatty acids
(blend of fish oil and sunflower oil, 15 ml/day) vs high dose
fish oil (4.5 g omega-3 fatty acids, 15 ml/day) and sug-
gested both groups significantly improved OA pain and
function and the low-dose fish oil group had lower pain
scores and better functional limitation scores compared
with the high-dose group. Difference in WOMAC pain and
function between high-dose and low-dose fish oil at 2
years was mean (S.E.) 3.1 (1.3) (P = 0.014) and 7.9 (4.0)
(P = 0.046), respectively. However, this study was limited
by the lack of a placebo control group to differentiate any
associated ‘placebo effects’ from treatment effects. The
effect of fish oil supplementation in OA is inconclusive
[38]. Well-designed placebo-controlled clinical trials are
needed to substantiate or refute the potential benefit of
fish oils in OA treatment. A commonly reported unwanted
side effects from fish oil supplementation was gastrointes-
tinal discomfort, with no differences between groups
[21, 22].

 Krill oil
The evidence for the use of krill oil supplements in OA is
sparse. One prospective randomized double blind clinical
trial in 90 people with cardiovascular disease and/or RA
and/or OA (number of OA patients was not reported) sug-
gested anti-inflammatory effects of krill oil (300 mg/day, 30
days) indicated by change in patient-reported OA symp-
toms on WOMAC [mean (S.D.) �38.35 (21.06) vs �0.6
(15.89), P = 0.011] [23]. Another RCT suggested krill oil
administration (2 g/day, 30 days) improved the subjective
symptoms in adults with mild knee pain; however, no dif-
ference was demonstrated with regards to the Japanese
Knee Osteoarthritis Measure (P = 0.99) [24].
GLM extracts
GLM, also called Perna canaliculus, is endemic to New
Zealand and has an important significance in the health
of the Maori population, which has a lowered incidence of
arthritis [39]. Traditionally, it has been used to treat various
arthralgias in both humans and animals including RA and
OA [39, 40]. One systematic review was conducted to
evaluate the efficacy of a GLM extract in the treatment
of OA; however, no estimated treatment effects were pro-
vided [25]. To date, three proprietary products have been
investigated including the GLM powder Seatone, the lipid
extract Lyprinol and BioLex-GLM. Despite the previous
positive results of Seatone (1050 mg/day, 3 months) and
Lyprinol (600 mg twice a day, 3�6 months) [26], a more
rigorous placebo-controlled RCT has been carried out in
New Zealand recently. A novel, bioactive GLM lipid ex-
tract (BioLex-GLM, 600 mg daily) was investigated in 80
patients with OA. There were no demonstrable clinical
benefits in moderate to severe hip and knee OA over
12 weeks (P = 0.11); however, participants in the GLM
arm reported lower paracetamol intake in the post-inter-
vention periods [27]. The evidence is still conflicting
though meta-regression analysis showed a significant re-
lationship between pain and type of marine oil (P = 0.012)
where only the effect of mussel oil was statistically signifi-
cant on its own, demonstrating a beneficial effect for arth-
ritis pain (SMD �0.95; 95% CI: �1.6, �0.31) [16].
Glucosamine
Glucosamine is an amino monosaccharide and a natural
constituent of glycosaminoglycan in the cartilage matrix
and SF. When administered exogenously, it is claimed to
exert specific pharmacological effects in OA by decreas-
ing IL-1-induced gene expression [41]. A recent system-
atic review included studies comparing the efficacy and
safety of glucosamine (dose regimen was 1500 mg/day in
single or divided doses) with placebo [28]. Neither clinic-
ally important effects for pain reduction (SMD �0.28;
95%
CI:
�0.52,
�0.04)
and
disability
improvement
(SMD �0.45; 95% CI: �0.73, �0.17) in the short term
nor structure modifying effects (i.e. change of minimum
or median joint-space width, SMD �0.19; 95% CI:
�0.48, 0.09) in the long term were found. This result is
consistent with the Cochrane review conducted in 2005
[29]. Sensitivity analysis suggested that small industry-
sponsored trials (with identified conflicts of interest)
demonstrated larger treatment effects than larger un-
funded or independently funded trials or trials without
conflicts of interest. Wu et al. [42] conducted a meta-ana-
lysis to compare the efficacies of different glucosamine
preparations and found that there was little difference be-
tween glucosamine sulfate and glucosamine hydrochlor-
ide regarding pain reduction. Glucosamine appears to be
safe to use according to the results of pooled risk
ratios for any reports of withdrawal and serious adverse
events [28].
Chondroitin sulfate
Chondroitin sulfate is a natural glycosaminoglycan that is
found in the cartilage and extracellular matrix. It is used for
patients with OA for its reported anti-inflammatory effects,
role in stimulating synthesis of proteoglycans and hyalur-
onic acid, and inhibition of the synthesis of proteolytic en-
zymes
[43].
A
Cochrane
review
of
chondroitin
supplementation (800�1200 mg/day) in OA found it was su-
perior to placebo in reducing pain in the short term though
the effect was small and with unclear clinical importance
(SMD �0.51; 95% CI: �0.74, �0.28) [30]; this is consistent
with the results of a subsequent systematic review that
suggested no clinically important effects of chondroitin for
pain (SMD �0.34; 95% CI: �0.49, �0.19) and physical
function (SMD �0.36; 95% CI: �0.58, �0.13) [28]. There
were no significant effects in pain relief (SMD �0.18; 95%
CI: �0.41, 0.05) and improvement of function (SMD �0.34;
95% CI: �1.06, 0.39) in the long term. The systematic
review suggested a small effect on structural improvement
(SMD �0.30; 95% CI: �0.42, �0.17) with high quality evi-
dence [28]. Chondroitin sulfate was found to be safe to use
from the reported results of pooled risk ratios regarding any
withdrawals and serious adverse effects [28].
Moreover, combination therapy of glucosamine and
chondroitin was not superior to placebo in terms of redu-
cing joint pain and functional impairment in patients with
symptomatic knee OA over 6 months [44]. The pooled
effect for pain reduction and function improvement was
SMD �0.06 (95% CI: �0.33, 0.20) and SMD 0.11 (95% CI:
�0.31, 0.54), respectively [30].
Vitamins D and E
A recent systematic review identified four studies includ-
ing 1136 participants that investigated the efficacy of vita-
min D for treating OA. The study duration ranged from 1 to
3 years and dose regimen from 800�2000 IU/day to
50 000�60 000 IU/month. There were no clinically import-
ant effects on pain or function; the pooled ES was SMD
�0.19 (95% CI: �0.31, �0.06) and SMD �0.36 (95% CI:
�0.61, �0.11), respectively [28]. The quality of evidence
was considered low and very low. Furthermore, high qual-
ity evidence reported no effect on joint space narrowing in
people with OA. Serious adverse events such as ureteric
calculus and kidney dysfunction were reported but these
were not significantly different compared with placebo,
and the risk ratio was 0.9 (95% CI: 0.7, 1.2) [28].

Supplements for OA patients
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article-abstract/57/suppl_4/iv75/4916021 by guest on 04 June 2019
 Vitamin E (500 IU daily, 6 months to 2 years) did not
appear to have a beneficial effect in the management of
symptomatic knee OA (for pain, SMD 0.01; 95% CI:
�0.44, 0.45; for physical function, SMD �0.1; 95% CI:
�0.55, 0.35) and did not affect cartilage volume loss or
symptoms [45, 46]. The quality of evidence was moderate
[28]. Supplementation with vitamin E has been associated
with a higher risk of bleeding.
Collagen derivatives
Collagen hydrolysate
Collagen hydrolysate (CH) consists of a range of peptides,
and supplementation has been claimed to decrease cartil-
age degeneration and delay the progression of OA by pro-
moting proteoglycan and type II collagen synthesis [47]. A
previous systematic review reported a beneficial effect of
collagen hydrolysate when comparing with placebo (mean
difference �0.49; 95% CI: �1.10, �0.12) though it was not
consistent with other studies [31]. When CH was compared
with glucosamine sulfate during 90 days of treatment, sig-
nificant between-group differences were found in favour of
CH [31]. Pooled analysis for pain reduction in a more recent
systematic review showed that collagen hydrolysate (10 g/
day, 6 months) was superior to placebo in the medium term
(SMD �0.28; 95% CI: �0.54, �0.02) though the effect was
small and without clinical importance. There were no ef-
fects on function and symptomatic improvements in the
long term [28]. It is considered Generally Recognized as
Safe by the US food standard agency [48]. The most re-
ported adverse events were mild to moderate gastrointes-
tinal complaints [31].
Undenatured collagen
Undenatured type II collagen (UC-II) is a nutritional sup-
plement derived from chicken sternum cartilage that has
been reported to induce tolerance and deactivate killer T
cell attack in RA [49]. Two RCTs evaluated the safety and
efficacy of UC-II (40 mg/day, 90 or 180 days) as compared
with either a combination of glucosamine and chondroitin
(G + C) or placebo in the treatment of knee OA. More
symptomatic benefits were reported in participants trea-
ted with UC-II compared with G + C (P = 0.04) and placebo
(P = 0.002) [32, 33].
Willow bark extract
Willow bark, the bark of several varieties of willow tree,
has been used for centuries, from Hippocrates (400 BC)
until today, as a pain reliever particularly for low back pain
and OA [50]. The active ingredient, salicin, which was
used to develop aspirin in the 1800s, is responsible for
the claimed anti-inflammatory effects [50]. Vlachojannis
et al. [51] conducted a systematic review on the efficacy
of willow bark for musculoskeletal pain that demonstrated
conflicting results in patients with OA. A subsequent sys-
tematic review identified two RCTs of willow bark extract
in a dose corresponding to 240 mg salicin per day,
including 162 participants in a period of 2 or 6 weeks,
and suggested no significant effect for symptomatic im-
provement when compared with placebo. The pooled ES
for pain reduction and physical improvement was SMD
�0.29 (95% CI: �0.62, 0.04) and SMD �0.24 (95% CI:
�0.55, 0.07), respectively. The quality of evidence was
low [28]. Adverse events such as allergic skin reactions
and gastrointestinal disorders were reported.
MSM
MSM is a naturally occurring organosulfur compound. In
vitro studies suggest that it inhibits the activity of tran-
scription factors such as kappa-light-chain-enhancer of
activated B cells (NF-kB) and downregulates the expres-
sion of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-
a [52]. One systematic review of MSM provided positive
but not definitive evidence that it is superior to placebo in
the treatment of mild to moderate OA of the knee [34]. A
subsequent systematic review identified three studies
including 148 participants with knee OA receiving MSM
(dose) for 12 weeks’ duration and demonstrated modest
to large treatment effects for pain relief (SMD �0.47; 95%
CI: �0.80, �0.14) and improvement in function (SMD
�1.10; 95% CI: �1.81, �0.38), though the quality of evi-
dence was low and very low, respectively [28]. The re-
spective investigating MSM dose regimens were 1.5, 3.4
and 6 g/day in divided doses, which highlighted the con-
cerns regarding optimal dosage. Mild gastrointestinal dis-
comfort was reported without serious side effects.
Plant based products and herbal medicines
Avocado/soybean unsaponifiables
Avocado/soybean unsaponifiables (ASU) (i.e. extracts) are
made of unsaponifiable fractions of one-third avocado oil
and two-thirds soybean oil. In vitro, ASU can improve the
imbalance between anabolic and catabolic processes in
cartilage, which contributes to its therapeutic effect [53].
From a recent systematic review, ASU at doses of 300 or
600 mg/day in patients with knee or hip OA demonstrated
moderate effects (SMD �0.57; 95% CI: �0.95, �0.19 for
pain reduction) and (SMD �0.48; 95% CI: �0.69, �0.28
for improvement in function) [28]. The short term, although
it was unclear whether these were clinically meaningful;
the quality of evidence was low. However, high quality
evidence showed no effects for symptomatic and struc-
tural improvement in long term studies [28].
No serious treatment-related adverse events were re-
ported. Adverse reactions were those usually expected,
with the most frequent being gastrointestinal, neuro-
logical, general and cutaneous symptoms. The risk ratio
for any adverse events and withdrawal due to adverse
events was 1.0 (95% CI: 1.0, 1.1) and 1.1 (95% CI: 0.6,
2.1) respectively with no significant difference between
ASU and placebo [28].
Turmeric/curcumin
Turmeric (Curcuma longa; an Indian spice) has been used
for thousands of years in Ayurveda as a treatment for in-
flammatory diseases. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a poly-
phenol, is the principal active ingredient [54]. Curcumin has
anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatic activity by influencing
numerous biochemical and molecular cascades such as

 transcription factors, growth factors, cytokines and apop-
tosis [55]. However, most pharmacokinetic and pharmaco-
dynamics
studies
indicated
that
curcumin
has
poor
absorption and bioavailability. To address this, several for-
mulations of curcumin have been prepared including nano-
particles,
liposomes,
micelles
and
phospholipid
complexes. Theracurmin, a curcumin formulation contain-
ing surface-controlled water-dispersible nanocurcumin, is
claimed to have higher bioavailability [56]. Piperine, a
major component of black pepper, is also used to increase
the bioavailability of curcumin [57]. Curcumin is thought to
exert its therapeutic effects for OA via various pathways
such as decreasing synthesis of inflammatory mediators,
anti-oxidative and anti-catabolic properties [58].
Curcumin demonstrated a large and clinically meaning-
ful effect on pain for patients with OA in a recent system-
atic review, though the quality of evidence was very low
(SMD �1.19; 95% CI: �1.93, �0.45) [28]. However, only
two studies were identified; these included a limited
number of 75 participants with different dosages and
preparations; one was Theracurmin using two capsules
three times per day (corresponding to 180 mg of curcu-
min) for 6 weeks; the other was curcuminoid (C3 complex)
in a dose of 1500 mg/day for 8 weeks [59, 60].
No serious adverse event was reported in either study.
There were mild gastrointestinal symptoms reported in the
curcuminoid treatment study. However, the potential
interaction
with
blood
thinners
deserves
attention
[61, 62] as well as its anticoagulant activities [63].
Boswellia serrata extract
Boswellia serrata extract is a gum resin extracted from the
frankinsence tree that is used for the treatment of a variety
of inflammatory diseases such as RA and OA [64]. The
most active component of Boswellia serrata extract is
3-acetyl-11-keto-b-boswellic acid; this has been demon-
strated to be a potent inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase [65].
A systematic review identified three studies [66�68] inves-
tigating two proprietary products of Boswellia serrata ex-
tract, 5-Loxin (50 or 125 mg twice daily) and Aflapin (50 mg
twice daily), in people with knee OA in trials of 1�3
months’ duration including 186 participants that demon-
strated large and clinically important treatment effects.
The pooled ES for pain relief and disability improvement
was SMD �1.61 (95% CI: �2.10, �1.13) and SMD �1.15
(95% CI: �1.63, �0.68), respectively. The quality of evi-
dence was low and very low [28].
No major adverse events were reported during the
study period. Minor adverse events were reported, includ-
ing nausea, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, fever
and general weakness. The risk ratio for any adverse
events was 0.7 (95% CI: 0.1, 4.8) [28].
Pycnogenol
Pycnogenol (bark extract of the maritime pine, Pinus pin-
aster) is a concentrate of plant polyphenols, composed of
several phenolic acids, catechin, taxifolin and procyani-
dins with claims of diverse biological and clinical effects
[69]. This extract is reported to have anti-inflammatory
effects through the inhibition of MMPs.
Three studies [70�72] investigated Pycnogenol (50 mg
twice or three times daily) in 182 participants with knee OA
for 3 months. Moderate quality of evidence indicated large
and clinically meaningful effects for pain relief (SMD
�1.21; 95% CI: �1.53, �0.89) and disability improvement
(SMD 1.84; 95% CI: �2.32, �1.35) [28]. No side effects or
serious adverse events were reported.
Rose hip
In vitro studies suggest that rose hip demonstrates anti-
inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties via an active
ingredient—a specific galactolipid (called GOPO) [35].
The efficacy of this herbal medicine (at a dose of 5 g/
day, duration 3�4 months) has been tested against pla-
cebo in three studies of 306 patients with knee, hip or
hand OA [73�75]. The results of a meta-analysis sug-
gested a small to moderate short-term effect of prepar-
ations with rose hip for pain reduction (SMD �0.37; 95%
CI: �0.60, �0.13) [35]. The latest placebo-controlled RCT,
including 100 participants, demonstrated no effects on
patients’ symptoms (Rosenoids, containing 750 mg rose
hip powder, three capsules once daily, 12 weeks) [36].
With regards to adverse events, no major side effects
were reported and the same number of mild cases of
gastrointestinal discomfort was reported in the rose hip
group as the control group.
Evidence-based recommendations for the use of supple-
ments in OA
Based on the above best research evidence, we would
not
recommend
the
following
dietary
supplements:
omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins D and E, willow bark ex-
tract, collagen hydrolysate, glucosamine, chondroitin,
combination of glucosamine and chondroitin, and rose
hip. This is because they did not provide clinically mean-
ingful effects (see Fig. 1). However, it is important to con-
sider that placebo effects may result from use of these
supplements [76].
Among the supplements investigated, Boswellia serrata
extract (5-Loxin, 50 or 125 mg twice daily; Aflapin, 50 mg
twice daily) and Pycnogenol (50 mg twice or three times
daily) demonstrated large and clinically important effects
for both pain relief and improvement of disability in par-
ticipants with OA (Fig. 1). The effects of curcumin for pain
and MSM for physical function were also large and with
clinical importance (Fig. 1). While there were large effects
in these trials, the quality of the evidence is low. As such it
is difficult to make a firm recommendation for them. In
general, we advise people who desire to trial these sup-
plements that they do so for a short period of time (4�6
weeks) and then cease if there are no obvious benefits.
Further high quality trials are needed to improve the
strength of this recommendation. The information with re-
gard to the dosing, precautions and interactions is sum-
marized in Table 2.
Future research priorities
The evidence to support supplements (e.g. Pycnogenol,
curcumin, Boswellia serrata extract, MSM) with large
treatment effects for treating OA is limited by the

 amount and quality of studies. Further robust studies with
longer treatment duration are required to confirm the effi-
cacy and safety of supplements. Studies for widely used
fish oil are sparse, and further placebo-controlled trials are
required to evaluate its efficacy and safety. Most of the
studies focused on knee or hip OA; more clinical trials on
hand OA are keenly needed. The majority of studies were
sponsored by the pharmaceutical companies, especially
those small studies inclined to demonstrate positive re-
sults [28]. Future pharmaceutical company sponsors
should not play roles at any stage of any trials to avoid
bias. More mechanistic basic research projects and trans-
lational research projects facilitating enhanced translation
of in vitro and preclinical studies are needed. Seven prop-
ositions for future research on the use of supplements for
OA are developed in Table 3.
Discussion
Only systematic reviews and randomized clinical trials
were considered for this review as they provided the
best evidence. We included the supplements that are
widely used by patients with OA and those with more re-
search evidence available. We proposed some condi-
tional recommendations for dietary supplements in OA,
which are based on meta-analyses of RCTs including
our latest published systematic review and previous
reports [16, 28, 35]. We would not suggest the use of
some widely used supplements (i.e. glucosamine, chon-
droitin, fish oil, etc.) while some little-known supplements
(i.e. curcumin, Boswellia serrata extract, etc.) with limited
research evidence demonstrated large treatment effects
with clinical importance. This evidence is drawn from the
highest category Ia: meta-analyses of RCTs [86].
This study has developed recommendations using ‘The
Evidence Alert Traffic Light System’, which was designed
to assist clinicians to obtain easily readable, clinically
useful answers within minutes based upon three-level
colour coding that recommends a course of action for
implementation of the evidence within their clinical prac-
tice [87]. For people living with OA who have good know-
ledge of their condition, who are enthusiastic to trial
supplements, a short period (4�6 weeks) of Pycnogenol,
curcumin, Boswellia serrata extract or MSM can be
advised and then stopped if there are no obvious benefits.
These supplements generally were recognized as safe for
people to use; however, both clinicians and patients still
need to be cautious over potential harm and interactions
with other medications (i.e. anticoagulant, antiplatelet
drugs, etc.) when making the recommendations especially
when high dose is being used (Table 2).
There are several caveats to consider regarding these
recommendations. Firstly, the aforementioned paucity of
research evidence for the supplements with large effects
limits the confidence with which we can recommend their
use. Secondly, the recommendations are mainly based on
the research evidence. We did not involve expert consen-
sus using a Delphi technique, which is often used to de-
velop guidelines [88]; therefore, these recommendations
may omit aspects such as the availability, logistical issues
and perceived patient acceptability of the supplements.
Moreover, we did not take into account patient opinion

 for these recommendations. As evidence-based method-
ology
continues
to
evolve,
evidence-based
practice
should base clinical decisions on the synthesis of informa-
tion from three key sources with equal weighting: research
evidence, clinical expertise, and patient preferences [89].
Finally, the current evidence was limited due to the poor
quality of available evidence; there is a need for more high
quality and longer duration studies on dietary supple-
ments for treating OA.
In conclusion, this study has identified recommendations
for the use of supplements and complementary medicines
for treating OA based on the best available research evi-
dence. For most of the supplements we found a paucity of
research evidence as well as poor study design, highlight-
ing the need for further well-conducted clinical trials. These
recommendations provide up-to-date information for phys-
icians, rheumatologists and other health professionals to
consider in developing future clinical trials.
