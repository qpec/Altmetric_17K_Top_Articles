IMPORTANCE Developing effective vaccines against Ebola virus is a global priority.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate an adenovirus type 26 vector vaccine encoding Ebola glycoprotein
(Ad26.ZEBOV) and a modified vaccinia Ankara vector vaccine, encoding glycoproteins from
Ebola virus, Sudan virus, Marburg virus, and Tai Forest virus nucleoprotein (MVA-BN-Filo).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled,
observer-blind, phase 1 trial performed in Oxford, United Kingdom, enrolling healthy 18- to
50-year-olds from December 2014; 8-month follow-up was completed October 2015.
INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized into 4 groups, within which they were
simultaneously randomized 5:1 to receive study vaccines or placebo. Those receiving active
vaccines were primed with Ad26.ZEBOV (5 × 1010 viral particles) or MVA-BN-Filo (1 × 108
median tissue culture infective dose) and boosted with the alternative vaccine 28 or 56 days
later. A fifth, open-label group received Ad26.ZEBOV boosted by MVA-BN-Filo 14 days later.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were safety and tolerability. All
adverse events were recorded until 21 days after each immunization; serious adverse events
were recorded throughout the trial. Secondary outcomes were humoral and cellular immune
responses to immunization, as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and
enzyme-linked immunospot performed at baseline and from 7 days after each immunization
until 8 months after priming immunizations.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this phase 1 study of healthy volunteers, immunization with
Ad26.ZEBOV or MVA-BN-Filo did not result in any vaccine-related serious adverse events. An
immune response was observed after primary immunization with Ad26.ZEBOV; boosting by
MVA-BN-Filo resulted in sustained elevation of specific immunity. These vaccines are being
further assessed in phase 2 and 3 studies.

T
he recent outbreak of Ebola virus disease in
West Africa has caused in excess of 28 600 cases
and 11 300 deaths since the first cases were identi-
fied in December 2013 in Guinea.1 The international re-
sponse has included the accelerated clinical devel-
opment of several candidate Ebola vaccines, which
have largely converged
on the stratagem of vec-
tor vaccine technology to
induce Ebola-specific
immune responses.2-7
Vaccines using adenovi-
rus serotype 26 (Ad26) as
a vector for delivery of
viral proteins have been
shown to induce robust
humoral and cellular
immune responses in
preclinical studies.8-10
Clinical trials of an Ad26-vectored candidate human immu-
nodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine have demonstrated that
this vaccine platform is immunogenic and well tolerated in
healthy adults.11,12 In nonhuman primates, an Ad26-
vectored vaccine was able to generate up to 75% protection
from Ebola challenge,13 and increased durability of Ebola
protection is achieved in adenovirus-vector vaccine primed
macaques that receive a booster dose of a modified vaccinia
Ankara (MVA)-based vaccine.14 Further Ebola challenge
studies demonstrated 100% efficacy for nonhuman pri-
mates receiving a priming dose of either Ad26- or MVA-
vectored vaccines with subsequent boosting by the alterna-
tive vector vaccine encoding the same Ebola glycoprotein
(heterologous prime/boost).15
This study evaluated the reactogenicity and immunoge-
nicity of immunization schedules using 2 novel candidate
Ebola vaccines—an adenovirus type 26 vector vaccine
encoding Ebola glycoprotein (Ad26.ZEBOV) and a mod-
ified vaccinia Ankara vector vaccine, encoding glyco-
proteins from Ebola virus, Sudan virus, Marburg virus, and
Tai Forest virus nucleoprotein (MVA-BN-Filo)—administered
to healthy adult volunteers in the United Kingdom at inter-
vals between 2 and 8 weeks (see the trial protocol in
Supplement 1).
Methods
Study Design and Participants
This single-center, randomized, observer-blind, placebo-
controlled, first-in-human, phase 1 trial took place in
Oxford, United Kingdom. Eligible participants were healthy
men and women aged 18 to 50 years who provided formal,
written consent and reported no prior immunization with a
candidate Ebola vaccine or any MVA- or Ad26-vectored vac-
cine (see the inclusion/exclusion criteria in eAppendix 1 in
Supplement 2). Baseline demographic characteristics
were recorded for all participants; given this phase 1 study
was conducted in a population geographically and ethni-
cally distinct from those experiencing the Ebola virus out-
break, these included self-defined ethnicity, classified using
protocol-defined options. Participants were randomized
equally into 4 vaccination schedules in the original study
design, and within each schedule, they were simultane-
ously randomized to receive active vaccine or placebo in a
5:1 ratio (Figure 1 and eTable 1 in Supplement 2). The inter-
vention groups included 2 with MVA-BN-Filo as prime vac-
cine on day 1 boosted by Ad26.ZEBOV on day 29 or day 57
and 2 with a priming dose of Ad26.ZEBOV boosted by MVA-
BN-Filo on day 29 or day 57. In response to a need to
urgently obtain data on shorter vaccine schedules that
might be of additional benefit in an outbreak setting, an
additional, nonrandomized, open-label group receiving
Ad26.ZEBOV prime and MVA-BN-Filo on day 15 was subse-
quently added by protocol amendment (see the trial proto-
col in Supplement 1). The protocol and study documents
were approved by the National Research Ethics Service.
Randomization and Masking
Participants in the randomized component of the study
were centrally randomized to 1 of 4 groups based on a
computer-generated block randomization schedule with
randomly permuted blocks and an interactive web response
system (eAppendix 1 in Supplement 2). Within groups, par-
ticipants were simultaneously randomized to active vaccine
or placebo at a ratio of 5:1. Participants and study team
members were blinded to active/placebo vaccine allocation
until all participants reached 21 days after boost, except
for a team of unblinded study personnel with the pri-
mary responsibility for study vaccine preparation and
administration. The unblinded team had no other involve-
ment in study procedures or assessments. Staff under-
taking laboratory analyses remained blinded throughout
the study.
Participants enrolled into the group receiving vaccines at
a 14-day interval were not randomized or blinded.
Procedures
Ad26.ZEBOV (Crucell Holland) is a monovalent, recombi-
nant, E1/E3-deleted, replication-defective, Ad26-vectored
vaccine expressing Ebola virus Mayinga variant glycopro-
tein, produced in PER.C6 human cells and provided in ster-
ile, single-dose vials at a concentration of 1 × 1011 viral
particles/mL. MVA-BN-Filo (Bavarian Nordic) is a recombi-
nant, replication-defective, modified vaccinia Ankara–
vectored vaccine expressing Mayinga variant glycoprotein
as well as Sudan virus Gulu variant glycoprotein, Marburg
virus Musoke variant glycoprotein, and Tai Forest virus
nucleoprotein. This multivalent vaccine was manufactured
in chicken embryo fibroblasts and provided in sterile, 2-mL
vials at a concentration of 2 × 108 median tissue culture
infective dose (TCID50)/mL. Both vaccines were manufac-
tured in accordance with current good manufacturing prac-
tices. All vaccines were administered into the deltoid
muscle at a dose of 5 × 1010 viral particles for Ad26.ZEBOV,
1 × 108 TCID50 for MVA-BN-Filo, and 0.5-mL 0.9% sodium
chloride solution for the placebo.

Adverse Events Monitoring
Participants were observed for 1 hour after vaccination to
record any immediate adverse event. For the day of each im-
munization and 7 subsequent days, participants recorded so-
licited symptoms that were local (eg, injection site pain) and
systemic (eg, myalgia). Safety blood tests were performed at
3 and 7 days after each prime and boost immunization and a
12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) trace performed at 3 days
postimmunization. All adverse events were recorded until 21
days after the boost immunization, and serious adverse events
were actively monitored throughout the trial by direct ques-
tioning at each study visit. With the exception of the 15 par-
ticipants receiving vaccines at a 14-day interval, staff perform-
ing safety evaluations were blinded to receipt of vaccine or
placebo.Alladverseeventsweregradedasmild(grade1),mod-
erate (grade 2), or severe (grade 3) on a scale adapted from the
US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Divi-
sion of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases toxicity table for
use in trials enrolling healthy adults.16
Immunogenicity Measurements
Immunogenicity assessments were performed on blood
samples taken immediately before primary and boost
immunizations, 7 days after primary and boost immuniza-
tions, and 21 days after boost immunizations. Those receiv-
ing vaccines at a 56-day interval had an additional blood
test 28 days after primary immunization (eTable 1 in
Supplement 2). After unblinding of vaccine allocation, par-
ticipants who received investigational vaccines had further
blood samples taken at day 180 and day 240; a further visit
at day 360 is planned and not reported here.
Total IgG responses against Ebola glycoprotein were
assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at
Battelle Biomedical Research Center. Purified recombinant
glycoprotein from the Ebola virus Kikwit variant provided
by the Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program was immobilized
on a 96-well microtiter plate. Test samples were serially
diluted and Ebola-specific antibodies were detected with
antihuman IgG antibodies conjugated with horseradish per-
oxidase followed by a colorimetric reaction.
Frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells were ana-
lyzed by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) and intracel-
lular cytokine staining at the HIV Vaccine Trials Network labo-
ratory as previously described.17
Further details of the ELISA and T-cell assays are pro-
videdineAppendix1inSupplement2,asaredetailsoftheAd26
neutralization assay used to evaluate seropositivity to adeno-
virus 26 prior to immunization.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the number of participants with
documented adverse events. Secondary outcomes were the
percentage of vaccine responders and the magnitude of the
humoral and cellular immune response as assessed by
ELISA and ELISpot. Exploratory outcomes included the
number of Ebola-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and the
proportion of polyfunctional cytokine-secreting T cells as
assessed by intracellular cytokine staining.
Statistical Analysis
We analyzed safety and immunogenicity data using sum-
mary statistics. No formal statistical testing of these out-
comes was planned nor performed. The study provided pre-
liminary safety and immunogenicity assessments, and thus
the sample size was not based on formal hypothesis testing
considerations but is within the range of participants as rec-
ommended by the International Conference on Harmonisa-
tion for first-in-human studies. With a sample size of 15 vac-
cine recipients in each group, it was determined that if no
participants experienced a significant reaction, this would
be associated with an upper limit of the 1-sided 97.5% confi-
dence interval, which excludes a true rate of 22% of such
reactions.
Geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) with 95% confi-
dence intervals were determined for Ebola-specific anti-
body responses measured by ELISA and also for end point
titers (the reciprocal of the most dilute titer at which spe-
cific IgG remained detectable) to facilitate cross-study com-
parisons. Median and interquartile ranges for background
subtracted T-cell interferon-γ (IFN-γ) from ELISpot and
cytokine responses from intracellular cytokine staining
assays were determined. All values below the lower limit of
quantification were substituted with half the lower limit of
quantification for analysis (18.3 ELISA units/mL, 25 spot-
forming units [SFUs] for ELISpot, and 0.02% for intracellu-
lar cytokine staining results); see eAppendix 1 in Supplement
2 for further information.
At each time point after baseline, a participant was de-
fined as a responder for ELISA, ELISpot,18 or intracellular cyto-
kine staining if negative at baseline and positive after base-
line or positive at baseline with at least 3-fold increase from
baseline.
The sponsor conducted all data analyses using SAS ver-
sion 9.2 (SAS Institute). Independent validation of all results
from raw data was completed at the University of Oxford using
SAS version 9.3.
Results
Participants were enrolled from December 30, 2014, to Feb-
ruary 18, 2015, and the last participant attended the day 240
assessment on October 29, 2015. All 87 participants were
aged between 18 and 50 years (median, 38.5 years); 66.7%
were female and 33.3% male (Table 1). Seventy-two partici-
pants were randomized to 4 groups of 18 (15 to active vac-
cine and 3 to placebo). An additional 15 participants were
included in the open-label group. Preexisting immunity to
Ad26 was observed in 3 of 87 participants (3.4%) at baseline.
Baseline characteristics were largely similar across groups.
Four participants did not receive a booster immuniza-
tion and were excluded from postboost safety and immuno-
genicity analyses (Figure 1). In the open-label group, 1 par-
ticipant voluntarily withdrew after prime vaccination with
Ad26.ZEBOV, having completed follow-up to 35 days after
prime immunization with no safety concerns. Two partici-
pants in the open-label group experienced a decrease in

neutrophil count (<1.0 × 109/L) after prime vaccination and
were excluded from receiving booster immunization. In the
group receiving AD26.ZEBOV prime and a MVA-BN-Filo
boost at day 57, 1 participant was lost to follow-up after
prime vaccination, having completed an observation period
of 7 days after prime immunization and last making contact
with the study team at 34 days after prime immunization
with no safety concerns.
Reactogenicity and Adverse Events
Solicited local and systemic reactions are displayed in
Table 2. Fever occurred after 3 of 60 (5%; 95% CI, 1%-14%)
Ad26.ZEBOV immunization episodes, 0 of 59 MVA-BN-Filo
immunization episodes, and 1 of 24 (4.2%; 95% CI, 0.1%-
21%) placebo immunization episodes in blinded partici-
pants. In the open-label component, fever occurred in 4 of
15 participants (26.7%; 95% CI, 8%-55%) after Ad26.ZEBOV
prime and 0 of 12 participants after MVA-BN-Filo boost. All
episodes of fever resolved within 24 to 48 hours. Three par-
ticipants reported a grade 3 local reaction (injection site ery-
thema [n = 2], injection site pain [n = 1], and swelling
[n = 1]) after Ad26.ZEBOV immunization. Five participants
(2/60 in the blinded groups, 3/15 in the open-label group)
reported grade 3 solicited systemic reactions after receiving
Ad26.ZEBOV (headache [n = 4], myalgia [n = 1], nausea
[n = 3], fatigue [n = 3], chills [n = 3], fever [n = 1]), and 1 par-
ticipant reported grade 3 fatigue after receiving placebo. No
grade 3 local or systemic solicited reactions were reported
after MVA-BN-Filo administration.
Unsolicited adverse events were observed in blinded
groups after 45 of 60 (75.0%; 95% CI, 62%-85%)
Ad26.ZEBOV immunizations, 40 of 59 (67.8%; 95% CI, 54%-
79%) MVA-BN-Filo immunizations, and 20 of 24 (83.3%;
95% CI, 63%-95%) placebo immunizations. For the open-
label group, unsolicited adverse events were observed in 14
of 15 participants (93.3%; 95% CI, 68%-99.9%) after the
Ad26.ZEBOV prime and 8 of 12 participants (66.7%; 95% CI,
35%-90%) after the MVA-BN-Filo boost immunizations.
Grade 3 unsolicited adverse events were observed in 4 vac-
cine recipients (2/60 in blinded groups, 2/15 in open-label
group). Of these, 2 had a decrease in neutrophil count to
below 1.0 × 109/L after the Ad26.ZEBOV prime vaccination;
1 reported an influenza-like illness at 42 days after the
Ad26.ZEBOV prime; and 1 individual sustained an unre-
lated, scalding injury 5 days after the Ad26.ZEBOV booster.
Grade 3 unsolicited adverse events were also observed in 3
placebo recipients (1 with grade 3 tonsillitis and grade 3 gas-
tritis and 2 with serum potassium <3.0 mmol/L). A transient
decrease in neutrophil count was reported after 24 of 75
(32.0%; 95% CI, 22%-44%) Ad26.ZEBOV immunization epi-
sodes and 5 of 71 (7.0%; 95% CI, 2%-16%) MVA-BN-Filo
immunization episodes, which was evident at 3 days
postimmunization and was resolved or resolving in all cases
by 7 days postimmunization. A decreased neutrophil count
of 1.5 to 2.0 × 109/L was reported after 5 of 24 (20.8%; 95%
CI, 7%-42%) placebo immunization episodes. No abnormali-
ties in ECG recordings occurred postimmunization. Four
serious adverse events occurred (details in eAppendix 2 in
Supplement 2); none of these were considered related to the
study vaccines.
Antibody Response
Ebola glycoprotein-specific responses are shown in Table 3,
Figure 2, and eFigure 1 in Supplement 2. At 14 days after the
Ad26.ZEBOV prime immunization, vaccine-induced anti-
body responses were detected by ELISA in 11 of 14 (79%; 95%
CI, 49%-95%) Ad26.ZEBOV-primed recipients in the nonran-
domized group. At 28 days after Ad26.ZEBOV in the random-
izedgroups,theseproportionswere14of15(93%;95%CI,68%-
99.9%) for those boosted at a 28-day interval and 14 of 14
(100%) for those boosted at a 56-day interval. By contrast, at
28 days after MVA-BN-Filo prime, vaccine-induced antibod-
ies were observed in 6 of 15 (40%; 95% CI, 16%-68%) of those
boosted at a 28-day interval and in 1 of 15 (6.7%; 95% CI, 0.2%-
32%) of those boosted at a 56-day interval.
At 21 days postboost, all vaccine recipients had Ebola-
specific IgG responses, with GMCs being highest in those
primed and boosted at a 56-day interval (7553 [95% CI, 5114-
11 156] for Ad26.ZEBOV prime recipients and 18 474 [95% CI,
12 418-27 483] for MVA-BN-Filo prime recipients).
The IgG responses were also analyzed as end point titers
as shown in eFigure 2 in Supplement 2. At 21 days after an
Ad26.ZEBOV prime and MVA-BN-Filo boost schedule given
at a 28-day interval, these titers were 8098.9 (95% CI,

29 481.3) when given in reverse order.
T-Cell Response
Ebola glycoprotein-specific T-cell responses, as assessed by
IFN-γ ELISpot, are displayed in Table 4 and eFigure 3 in
Supplement 2. Vaccine-specific responses were observed 14
days after Ad26.ZEBOV prime immunization in 11 of 14 par-
ticipants (79%; 95% CI, 49%-95%) boosted at day 15 and at
28 days after prime immunization in 9 of 15 (60%; 95% CI,
32%-84%) and 7 of 14 (50%; 95% CI, 23%-77%) recipients (in
those boosted at 28- and 56-day intervals, respectively).
This response was only observed in 1 of 29 (3%; 95% CI,
0%-18%) primary MVA-BN-Filo recipients.
After booster immunizations, the percentage of T-cell re-
sponders was 92%, 79%, and 100% in those receiving
Ad26.ZEBOV with MVA-BN-Filo booster at 14-, 28-, and 56-
day intervals, respectively, compared with 73% and 87% of
those receiving MVA-BN-Filo with Ad26.ZEBOV booster at 28-
and 56-day intervals, respectively.

Exploratory Outcomes
Ebola-specific CD8+ T-cell cytokine expression was observed
following primary immunization in 29% and 57% of
Ad26.ZEBOV recipients at 14 and 28 days after immuniza-
tion, respectively, but no MVA-BN-Filo recipients (eFigure 4
and eTable 2 in Supplement 2). At 21 days postboost, the re-
sponder rates were 50% to 79% in the Ad26.ZEBOV prime
groups and 47% to 53% in MVA-BN-Filo prime groups. All
schedules induced highly polyfunctional T-cell responses that
weremaintainedafterboost(eFigure6inSupplement2).CD4+
T-cell responses were observed in 57% to 67% of vaccine re-
cipients at 21 days after boosting (eFigure 5 and eTable 3 in
Supplement 2).
Immunogenicity Persistence
Sixty-seven of 75 active vaccine recipients attended
follow-up at day 240, at which time the durability of
immune responses was analyzed. One-hundred percent
of these individuals maintained Ebola-specific IgG
responses (Table 3). Vaccine-induced T-cell responses per-
sisted in 77% to 80% of randomized Ad26.ZEBOV-prime-
with-MVA-BN-Filo-boost participants, compared with 79%
to 100% of those receiving the reverse schedules (Table 4).
Persistence of the CD8+ response is shown in eFigure 4 and
eTable 2 and the CD4+ response in eFigure 5 and eTable 3 in
Supplement 2.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first report on the safety and
immunogenicity of the Ad26.ZEBOV vaccine and its heter-
ologous combination with MVA-BN-Filo. This phase 1 study
demonstrated an acceptable safety profile in recipients of
Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo, albeit in a small sample
size. More than 90% of healthy adults generated Ebola
glycoprotein-specific IgG 4 weeks after a priming dose of
Ad26.ZEBOV, and 55% (95% CI, 35%-74%) developed spe-

cific T cells. These responses were enhanced by administra-
tion of an MVA-BN-Filo booster dose and were sustained at
8 months after the prime vaccination.
The data reported here add to the growing literature
on the clinical application of candidate Ebola vaccines.
This field includes replication-defective adenovirus 5 and
chimpanzee adenovirus 3–vectored vaccines.2,3,6 The
latter has been reported as a single-dose regimen, with
persistence of immune responses to 6 months after
immunization.19 Priming with this vaccine and subsequent
MVA-BN-Filo boosting resulted in further elevation in
humoral and cellular immunity.7 Interim efficacy data from
a ring vaccination trial using a live vesicular stomatitis virus
(VSV) vector vaccine in Guinea provided the first indication
that protective vaccine-derived immunity against Ebola
may be attainable in humans via Ebola glycoprotein
expressed by a vectored vaccine.20 As a live vaccine, the
VSV vaccine may be relatively reactogenic, and there were
reports of vaccine-induced arthritis and dermatitis in phase
1 studies.4,5 At lower doses of VSV vaccine, there was
reduced immunogenicity and reduced early-onset reactoge-
nicity, but vaccine-induced arthritis and dermatitis were
still observed.21 It is highly desirable that multiple options
for immunization against Ebola are available in the event of
a resurgence in the incidence of Ebola, either in West Africa
or elsewhere, thus reducing any risks associated with
potential safety signals or supply problems due to a single
vaccine manufacturer.
In our study, injection-site pain was the most commonly
reported adverse event, which was generally of mild to
moderate severity. Hematological measures were notable
for a transient decrease in neutrophil count, observed after
7% of MVA-BN-Filo immunizations and 32% of Ad26.ZEBOV
immunizations. Of note, decreased neutrophil count was
also observed after 21% of placebo immunizations. Tran-
sient neutropenia has been described following immuniza-
tion with other adenoviral-vectored vaccines, including the
chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored Ebola vaccine,3 and is not
perceived to be of any clinical significance.
There is, as yet, no known correlate of protection
against Ebola disease. Ebola glycoprotein-specific IgG does
appear to have an important role in immunity.22,23 In addi-
tion, data from nonhuman primate models provide evi-
dence of a role for cellular immunity, particularly CD8+ T
cells producing TNF-α and IFN-γ (+/− IL-2),14,24 as detected
in this study. No data are published on the cellular immune
response to the VSV vaccine shown to be protective in
humans; however, comparisons between the ELISA end
point titers observed following VSV immunization and the
heterologous Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo immunization
schedule can be made, as both studies conducted ELISA
analyses according to the Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program
protocol. Within the limits of comparisons between differ-
ent clinical laboratories and studies, the end point titers
observed at 21 days after the booster dose in the 4 random-
ized groups in our study were higher than was reported 28
days after a single dose of the VSV vaccine at a dose of
2 × 107 plaque-forming units.4,5
The increased immunogenicity seen after heterologous
prime-boost in this study and the persistence of cellular and
humoral immune responses to at least 8 months after prim-
ing immunization might provide an advantage over a single-
dose strategy, particularly given the dwindling Ebola epi-
demic when durability of protection may become more
important than the speed with which complete protection is
achieved. Epidemiological modeling provides evidence
that prophylactic immunization of health care workers
in Ebola epidemic risk areas using vaccines offering dura-
ble protection would offer far greater benefit, in terms of
limiting the effect of any future outbreak, when compared
with a reactive immunization strategy such as ring
vaccination.25 Furthermore, the evidence of persistence of
Ebola virus in bodily fluids,26,27 as well as the potential
for onward sexual transmission by convalescent Ebola
survivors,28 reinforce the importance of generating a dura-
ble immune response.
Our data showed that, in contrast to MVA-BN-Filo,
Ad26.ZEBOV priming generated an initial immune response,
and there is evidence for protection from this vaccine given
alone in nonhuman primate models.13 Therefore, this prim-
ing dose would be expected to generate at least partial pro-
tection against Ebola; for this reason, Ad26.ZEBOV prime
schedules with MVA-BN-Filo boost are currently being fur-
ther evaluated in phase 1, 2, and 3 studies.
The relatively low response to MVA-BN-Filo prime
might limit the use of the MVA-BN-Filo prime schedules in
an Ebola outbreak situation. However, the postboost anti-
body and T-cell responses appear robust in these groups,

and these schedules merit further study. Additional immuni-
zation schedules using priming with the MVA-BN-Filo vac-
cine are being evaluated in a separate phase 1 study and will
further inform the potential role for this approach.29 These
data may also have relevance to other investigational vac-
cines using MVA-based vaccines in heterologous prime-boost
immunization schedules, such as those against malaria.30
This study has limitations. Although the data presented
here suggest the potential for sustained elevation of specific
immunity, this was a phase 1 study designed to determine
safety and immunogenicity in a population unconfounded
by intercurrent Ebola infections. As such, it was conducted
in a population unlikely to be affected by Ebola. This may be
of relevance when considering the importance of baseline
immunity against the Ad26 vector in potentially impairing
the immune response to the target antigen, as was seen for
an Ad5-vectored Ebola vaccine.6 Seroepidemiological stud-
ies reveal that high neutralizing antibody titers to the Ad26
serotype are uncommon in the populations of Europe,
North America, and sub-Saharan Africa,31-33 with titers
above 1000 seen in 0% to 6.3% of adults from sub-Saharan
Africa.32 Approximately 40% to 60% of tested sera from
sub-Saharan Africa did display low to moderate (18-1000)
neutralizing antibody titers against Ad26.33 While the lack
of interference observed in Ad26-seropositive rhesus mon-
keys immunized with an Ad26-vectored HIV vaccine pro-
vides some reassurance that such titers will not interfere
with the vaccine’
s immunogenicity,33 no human data are yet
available to address this issue. The very low proportion of
individuals with baseline Ad26-neutralizing antibody
observed in our study population (3.4%) precludes any con-
clusion regarding the effect of preexisting vector immunity
on vaccine immunogenicity. This issue will be evaluated in
ongoing phase 1 and phase 2 studies. Furthermore, analyses
of the immune response to the additional filovirus antigens
incorporated in the MVA-BN-Filo vaccine are planned but
not available as yet. Another limitation is the pragmatic
addition of the open-label, nonrandomized group to pro-
vide additional, expedited, data; the rates of solicited symp-
toms in the open-label group therefore need to be inter-
preted with caution.
Conclusions
Immunization with Ad26.ZEBOV or MVA-BN-Filo demon-
strated no serious vaccine-related adverse events. An im-
muneresponsewasobservedafterprimaryimmunizationwith
Ad26.ZEBOV; boosting by MVA-BN-Filo resulted in sustained
elevation of Ebola glycoprotein-specific immunity. The im-
munogenicity and safety of these vaccines are being further
assessed in phase 2 and 3 studies.

s Horizon 2020
research and innovation program and the European
Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and
Associations. The study sponsor was Crucell
Holland, who also provided funding for the
nonrandomized group immunized at a 14-day
interval.
Role of the Funder/Sponsor: The Innovative
Medicines Initiative, the National Institutes of
Health (NIH), and the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) had no role in the
study design, data collection and analysis, decision
to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. The
study was designed as a collaboration between the
sponsor (Crucell Holland) and the investigators.
Data were collected by investigators at the Oxford
Vaccine Group. Data analysis was performed by
employees of the sponsor and independently
verified by a statistician at the University of Oxford.
Additional Contributions: MVA-BN Filo was
produced under NIAID/Fisher BioServices contract
FBS-004-009 and NIH contract
HHSN272200800044C. The Janssen filovirus
project has been funded in part with direct federal
funds from the NIAID, part of NIH, under contract
HHSN272200800056C. The Joint Vaccine
Acquisition Program, part of the US Joint Program
Executive Office for Chemical and Biological
Defense, provided recombinant Ebola virus
glycoprotein for the ELISA reported here. Professor
Pollard and Dr Snape are Jenner Investigators.
