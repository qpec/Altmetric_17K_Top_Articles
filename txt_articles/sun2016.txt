IMPORTANCE Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) through surgical castration is equally
effective as medical castration in controlling prostate cancer (PCa). However, the adverse
effect profiles of both ADT groups have never been compared.
OBJECTIVE To provide a comparative effectiveness analysis of the adverse effects of
gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) vs bilateral orchiectomy in a
homogeneous population.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A population-based cohort of 3295 men with
metastatic PCa between January 1995 and December 2009 66 years or older was selected
from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Medicare-linked database.
EXPOSURES Orchiectomy or GnRHa.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Any fractures, peripheral arterial disease, venous
thromboembolism, cardiac-related complications, diabetes mellitus, and cognitive disorders.
To minimize treatment group biases, the inverse probability of treatment was weighted using
the propensity score. Multivariable competing risk regression models were performed with
the adjustment of all-cause mortality. Secondary analyses examined the effect of increasing
duration of GnRHa treatment. Multivariable logistic regression models examined
expenditures.
RESULTS Overall, 3295 men with a primary diagnosis of metastatic PCa treated with GnRHa
or orchiectomy were identified between years 1995 and 2009, and in adjusted analyses,
patients who received a bilateral orchiectomy had significantly lower risks of experiencing
any fractures (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62-0.94; P = .01), peripheral arterial disease
(HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.49-0.87; P = .004), and cardiac-related complications (HR, 0.74;
0.58-0.94; P = .01) compared with those treated with GnRHa. No statistically significant
difference was noted between orchiectomy and GnRHa for diabetes and cognitive disorders.
In individuals treated with GnRHa for 35 months or more, the increased risk for GnRHa
compared with orchiectomy was noted for fractures (HR, 1.80), peripheral arterial disease
(HR, 2.25), venous thromboembolism (HR, 1.52), cardiac-related complications (HR, 1.69),
and diabetes mellitus (HR, 1.88) (P � .01 for all). At 12 months after PCa diagnosis, the
median total expenditures was not significantly different between GnRHa and orchiectomy.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy is
associated with higher risks of several clinically relevant adverse effects compared with
orchiectomy.

A
ndrogen-deprivation therapy (ADT) achieved with sur-
gical or medical castration, leading to disruption of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, has been a cor-
nerstone in the management of metastatic prostate cancer
(PCa) for the past half-century.1 Indeed, the effectiveness of
ADT for treatment of advanced PCa has been demonstrated in
several clinical studies. For example, ADT is supported by level
1 evidence as neoadjuvant, concurrent, or adjuvant treat-
ment to radiotherapy for men with high-risk and locally-
advanced PCa.2 In men with metastatic PCa, results from the
SWOG-9346 trial3 suggest that the survival outcomes be-
tween intermittent and continuous ADT were inconclusive.
However, a 20% greater mortality risk with intermittent ADT
cannot be ruled out. Given that the study failed to demon-
strate noninferiority of intermittent ADT with respect to sur-
vival compared with continuous ADT, continuous ADT cur-
rently represents the standard of care for metastatic PCa
accordingtonationalguidelines.4Thatsaid,2meta-analyses5,6
on randomized clinical trials reported no survival difference
between intermittent and continuous ADT. However, there is
mounting evidence that ADT is linked to significant adverse
effects, such as cardiovascular events,7,8 diabetes,8,9 acute kid-
ney injury,10 and bone loss.11,12
In contemporary years, cosmetic and psychological con-
cerns have nearly eliminated the use of bilateral orchiectomy
in the United States, even for patients who will need lifelong
ADT.13 However, one of the publications that first noted an in-
creased risk for cardiac events on gonadotropin-releasing hor-
mone agonists (GnRHa) indirectly observed that patients who
received orchiectomy may not have the same increased risk
of cardiac events.8 Some have hypothesized that the adverse
cardiac events may be somehow linked to the GnRHa them-
selves rather than the hypogonadism effect.14 Hence, there is
a possibility that orchiectomy could be associated with fewer
adverse effects on multiple health domains compared with
long-term GnRHa use.
Our objective was to perform a direct comparison of ad-
verse effects of GnRHa vs orchiectomy vs no ADT in men with
metastatic PCa. Given that providing value and cost-effective
care has never been more important, we also sought to per-
form an updated analysis of the differential expenditures ac-
cording to ADT groups in the contemporary era.

Data Source
Data originated from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results (SEER) program of cancer registries that collect clini-
cal demographic and cause of death information for persons
with cancer and the Medicare claims for covered health care
services from the time of a person’
s Medicare eligibility until
death.TolinkSEERwithMedicaredata,theparticipatingSEER

which are matched with identifiers contained in Medicare’

and older in the SEER files were matched to the Medicare en-
rollment file.15
Study Cohort
Patients with a primary diagnosis of PCa who were 66 years
or older between January 1995 and December 2009 were iden-
tified(n = 28 749).PatientswhowerenotenrolledinbothParts
A and B Medicare 12 months before and 12 months after their
diagnosis (n = 11 810), those part of a health maintenance or-
ganization (HMO), or those diagnosed on autopsy or death cer-
tificate only (n = 5725) were not considered. Patients who had
nonmetastatic PCa (n = 3854) were removed from our analy-
ses. This resulted in 7360 patients with a primary diagnosis of
metastatic PCa. From these, those who had both GnRHa and
orchiectomy (n = 91 [1.2%]), radical prostatectomy (n = 150
[0.7%]), radiotherapy (n = 1176 [16.0%]), both (n = 3 [0.4%]),
or those who did not receive any therapy (n = 2002 [27.2%])
were omitted. This resulted in 4336 patients. Patients with un-
known marital status (n = 274 [6.3%]), unknown race (n = 9
[0.2%]), unknown region (n = 703 [16.2%]), and unknown in-
come (n = 55 [1.3%]) were also removed. A total of 3295 pa-
tients remained in our study. Patients who received bilateral
orchiectomy (Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System
[HCPCS] codes 54520, 54521, 54522, 54530 or 54535, or the
International Classifications of Diseases, 9th Revision [ICD-9]
code 624) were differentiated from those who received 1 or
moredosesofGnRHa(HCPCScodesJ1950,J9202,J9217,J9218,
J9219).8,12 Only those who received GnRHa or orchiectomy as
primary cancer therapy within 12 months of metastatic PCa di-
agnosis were included. Of note, patients who received anti-
androgens as monotherapy or in combination with GnRHa, as
wellasmenwhoreceivedGnRHantagonists,werealsonotcon-
sidered in the analyses since FDA approval was only obtained
in 2008.
Covariates and Study End Points
The primary end points examined in the current analysis were
comprised of 6 major adverse effects: any fractures, periph-
eral arterial disease, venous thromboembolism, cardiac-
related complications, diabetes mellitus, and cognitive disor-
ders. These adverse outcomes were selected on the basis of
At a Glance
•The purpose of our study was to compare the adverse effect
profiles of medical vs surgical castration.
•Medical castration was associated with higher risks of several
clinically relevant adverse effects compared with orchiectomy.
•Surgical castration was associated with lower risks of any
fractures (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62-0.94), peripheral
arterial disease (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.49-0.87), and cardiac-
related complications (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58-0.94) compared
with medical castration.
•In some patients who need permanent androgen suppression,
surgical castration may represent a suitable alternative to
medical castration.

their effect on a patient’
s quality of life, the potential for in-
creased health care costs, and previously described associa-
tion with ADT use.8,12,16,17 Age at diagnosis, race (white, black,
other), marital status (single, unmarried), SEER regions (East,
Northern Plain, Pacific Coast, Southwest), county-specific in-
come levels, as well as year of diagnosis, were considered as
covariates. Biopsy Gleason score was dichotomized as 7 or
lower vs 8 to 10. Baseline comorbidities were computed ac-
cording to the Klabunde-modified Charlson comorbidity in-
dex (CCI).18
Finally, the expenditures associated with use of ADT was
assessed as a seventh end point. To accomplish this, all Medi-
care health expenditures 12 months after PCa diagnosis were
extracted based on claims from inpatient, outpatient, and phy-
sicianservicesandsummed.Usingeachpatientashisowncon-
trol, we subtracted health expenditures accrued 12 months
prior to use of ADT to estimate the baseline annual health
charges for each patient, as previously described.19 All expen-
ditures are reported in 2009 US dollars.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to describe the patient popu-
lation according to ADT status. Differences between treat-
ment groups and categorical baseline characteristics were
compared using the χ2 test; the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was
used to compare differences in median values and distribu-
tions of continuous factors in non-normally distributed
populations.
First, to account for potential treatment selection biases
arising from nonrandom allocation of patients to different ADT
groups, we relied on the inverse probability of treatment
weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score.20 It uses weights
based on the propensity score to create a synthetic sample in
which the distribution of measured baseline covariates is in-

dependent of treatment assignment. Covariates included were
age, CCI, year of diagnosis, race, Gleason score, income, mari-
tal status, and region.
Second, to determine the effect of ADT type, primary
analyses consisted of competing risk regression models that
examined each major adverse effect. In all these models,
GnRHa was used as the referent category. All models were
adjusted for all-cause mortality. We chose to rely on com-
peting risk regression models, as described by Fine and
Gray,21 instead of the conventional Cox regression models
because competing risk regression models control for the
loss of patients due to death at various time points. Of inter-
est, when the same outcomes were examined using Cox
regression models, none of the examined end points
showed any statistically significant differences between
GnRHa and orchiectomy. Indeed, the 2 treatment groups
demonstrated significant variability in patient censoring
(log-rank P < .001) and overall survival (log-rank P = .029).
For this reason, we chose to rely on the competing risk
regression models, although it is important to acknowledge
the strengths in both model types.22
Furthermore,foreachendpointofinterestthatwastested,
patients with a baseline condition of the end point studied
within that model were excluded. For example, 714 patients
with a baseline fracture-related diagnosis 12 months prior to
PCa diagnosis were excluded when looking at the risk of ex-
periencing any fracture according to ADT status.
Third, secondary analyses were conducted by examining
duration of GnRHa exposure quartiles (1-9, 10-17, 18-34, ≥35
months).12 In these analyses, orchiectomy was used as the ref-
erent category. Finally, expenditure-effective comparisons be-
tween treatment groups were made using multivariable logis-
tic regression models. In this step, more expensive treatment
12 months after PCa diagnosis was defined according to total
expenditures above the 75th percentile ($21 451.65). All sta-
tistical testing was 2-sided with a level of significance set at
P < .05. All analyses were performed with SAS version 10 (SAS
Institute).

Results
Baseline Characteristics
Overall, 3295 men with a primary diagnosis of metastatic PCa
treatedwithGnRHa(n = 2866[87.0%])ororchiectomy(n = 429
[13.0%]) between 1995 and 2009 were identified (Table 1). Sta-
tisticallysignificantdifferenceswereobservedaccordingtoage,
baseline CCI, income, region, and year of diagnosis (P = .03 for
all comparisons) (Table 1). The 3-year overall survival rate was
46% (95% CI, 44%-48%) for GnRHa treatment vs 39% (95% CI,
35%-44%) for orchiectomy (log-rank P = .03). Following the in-
verseprobabilityoftreatmentweighting,the2groupswerewell
balanced (Table 2).
Adjusted Outcomes
In adjusted analyses, orchiectomy was associated with signifi-
cantly lower risks of any fracture (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62-0.94),
peripheralarterialdisease(HR,0.65;95%CI,0.49-0.87),andcar-
diac-relatedcomplications(HR,0.74;95%CI,0.58-0.94)(Table3)
compared with GnRHa. Our results also showed that patients
whoreceivedGnRHaforthelongestduration(≥35months)were
at the greatest risks of experiencing 5 of 6 of the examined end
points: any fracture (HR, 1.80), peripheral arterial disease (HR,
2.25),venousthromboembolism(HR,1.52),cardiac-relatedcom-
plications (HR, 1.69), and diabetes mellitus (HR, 1.88) (P ≤ .001
for all comparisons) (Table 4).
Expenditures
At 1 year after PCa diagnosis, the median total expenditures
were$9726.98fororchiectomyvs$8478.46forGnRHa(P = .24)
(Table 5). After adjusting for treatment propensity scores, no
difference with respect to total expenditures greater than the
75th percentile was observed between GnRHa and orchiec-
tomy (odds ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.88-1.45).
Discussion
Inthecurrentstudy,wesoughttodirectlycomparetheadverse-
effectprofilesofGnRHavsorchiectomyand,subsequently,the
expenditures between the 2 approaches. Primarily, our find-
ings indicate that GnRHa was associated with significantly
higher risks of fractures, peripheral arterial disease, and car-
diac-related complications compared with surgical castra-
tion. When GnRHa was stratified into 4 different categories ac-
cording to duration of therapy, our findings indicate that
duration of GnRHa exposure of 35 months or more had a di-
rect negative effect on the patients’health with respect to frac-
tures, peripheral arterial disease, venous thromboembolism,
cardiac-related complications, and diabetes mellitus com-
pared with orchiectomy. Cognitive disorders including major
depression and dementia were not shown to be different be-
tween orchiectomy and GnRHa.
The fewer ADT-related toxic effects associated with orchi-
ectomy relative to GnRHa noted in this study suggest that dif-
ferences in the physiologic effects of orchiectomy vs GnRHa
therapyhasclinicallysignificantimplications.Thespecificbio-
logical mechanisms need to be better elucidated, but several
theories may be put forth. First, effect on endogenous andro-
gens may not be equivalent between the 2 therapies. Gonado-
tropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy is associated with
an initial surge in testosterone levels. It is possible that the ad-
verse effects associated with these treatments are precipi-
tated by this initial androgen surge. However, the increase in
GnRHa side-effects with time suggest that the initial brief in-

levels above the levels achieved after bilateral orchiectomy.23
The residual androgen activity is a result of adrenal androgen
production, as well as possible breakthrough testicular pro-
duction in the case of GnRHa therapy. The latter is thought to
be the cause of the persistent microsurges in testosterone lev-
els seen in about 6% of patients treated with GnRHa.24 How-
ever, these microsurges have unclear relevance when it comes
to PCa outcomes and adverse effects. It is also possible that
higher testosterone levels are seen in patients taking GnRHa
therapy owing to noncompliance, which is not relevant after
orchiectomy. However, higher testosterone levels should im-
prove bone density and thus reduce fracture rates25 and the
incidence of cardiovascular disease.26 Therefore, testoste-
rone levels cannot explain the totality of the findings shown
herein.
An alternative explanation could be related to differing
effects on other hormones. Whereas orchiectomy leads to
low anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels and high luteiniz-
ing hormone and follicle-stimulation hormone levels,
GnRHa are associated with unchanged AMH levels and low
or low-normal follicle-stimulation hormone and luteinizing
hormonelevels.27 Another hormonal change that occurs
with both orchiectomy and GnRHa therapy is a reduction in
inhibin-B levels.27 However, the actual clinical relevance of
these changes on our current findings are unknown and
remain speculative at best.
Against a backdrop of increasing demand for better value
in American health care and the continued need for long-
term castration in select men with advanced PCa, these re-
sults suggest that some consideration should be given to bet-
ter incorporate the use of bilateral orchiectomy for men who
needpermanentandrogensuppression.Thisoptionmaybead-
vantageous for the patient (ie, increased avoidance of long-
termadverseeffects)andpossiblythehealthcaresystem.Both
GnRHa and bilateral orchiectomy represent equally effective
ADTforlocallyadvancedormetastaticPCa.However,sincethe
introduction of GnRHa, surgical castration has been on the
decline.13 Indeed, 7 of 10 patients would opt for GnRHa given
thechoice.28Certainly,thereasonforthisdramaticshiftismul-
tifactorial. The preference of medical over surgical castration
is likely largely associated with patients’fear of the less desir-
able cosmetics, psychological factors about self-image, stress
of the surgical procedure, and the irreversibility of the inter-
vention. However, several investigators have shown that the
actual psychological effect of surgical castration may not be as
significant as it is perceived to be. For example, Bonzani et al29
examined quality of life and body image among medically and
surgicallycastratedpatients,andfoundnodifference.Datafrom
the US Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study showed that GnRHa-
treated men were more likely to worry about their disease and
more often expressed a general dissatisfaction with their over-
all health compared with those who received an orchiectomy
(67% vs 51%) (P = .004).30 Apart from the patient’
s perspec-
tive, other reasons for the dramatic rise of GnRHa therapy may
possibly include the lack of discussion of both treatment op-
tions in an unbiased fashion, the urge to provide treatment in
the setting of a rising prostate-specific antigen, and/or finan-
cial incentives to clinicians. Our results highlight the impor-
tance of continuing to present patients with the pros and cons
of medical vs surgical castration.
Despite its strengths, our study is not devoid of limita-
tions. Overall limitations reflect challenges related to expo-
sureassessmentinMedicareclaims,includinginaccuraciesand
thetimeframeoftreatmentascertainment.31Primarily,itisalso
limited by its retrospective design. Specifically, patients were
not randomized to receive GnRHa, orchiectomy, or no ADT. In-
herent differences with respect to number of patients, and pa-
tient and clinical characteristics between the 2 groups may be
present but unmeasured in our analyses. Second, given that
the current database is limited to men 65 years and older, the
resultscannotbedirectlyapplicabletoyoungerpatients.Other
considerations (ie, intermittent vs continuous ADT) in men
younger than 65 years with a primary diagnosis of metastatic
PCa may need to be evaluated in conjunction with risks of ad-
verse effects. Third, PSA data were not available due to a cod-
ing issue, precluding the ability to adjust for this variable in
our analyses. This represents an important limitation of the
study. There is a need for prospective studies of GnRHa com-
pared with orchiectomy and other ADT treatments (ie, GnRH
antagonists). These would provide convincing level 1 evi-
dence and help to determine whether the risks of GnRHa are
real and whether the risks are unique to specific types of ADT.
Furthermore, many unmeasured confounders (ie, body mass
index, tobacco use, and genetic predisposition) could not be
accounted for. As disease outcomes were identified using di-
agnosis codes in administrative data, we also cannot exclude
the possibility that men with more frequent doctor visits were
more likely to be diagnosed and treated with these adverse
events, although we expect that even patients who under-
went orchiectomy would continue to have frequent visits for
PSA and symptom checks to evaluate for possible emergence
of castration-resistant disease. That said, patients who under-
went orchiectomy may have actually been recommended as
suchbecauseoftheirnoncompliance.Inthesub-analysescom-
paring duration of GnRHa to orchiectomy may be biased, as
those still receiving treatment beyond 35 months after diag-
nosis may be significantly different with respect to health and
disease status compared with all orchiectomy patients. We
sought to address this limitation by adjusting for confound-
ers and, most importantly, by accounting for all-cause mor-
tality using competing risk models. Hence, the number of
deaths, if greater in the orchiectomy group, was accounted for
when measuring the effect of ADT on side effects.
Conclusions
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy was asso-
ciated with higher risks in 3 of 6 examined adverse effects: any
fractures, peripheral arterial disease rates, and cardiac-
related complications. In some patients who need perma-
nent androgen suppression, surgical castration may repre-
sent a suitable alternative to GnRHa. However, other
considerations must be contemplated when deciding be-
tween medical or surgical castration (ie, young age, intermit-
tent ADT).
