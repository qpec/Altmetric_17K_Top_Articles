 Hair Cortisol and Adiposity in a Population-Based Sample
of 2,527 Men and Women Aged 54 to 87 Years
Sarah E. Jackson1, Clemens Kirschbaum2, and Andrew Steptoe1
Objective: Chronic cortisol exposure is hypothesized to contribute to obesity. This study examined asso-
ciations between hair cortisol concentrations, a novel indicator of long-term cortisol exposure, and adi-
posity in a large population-based sample.
Methods: Data were from 2,527 men and women aged 54 and older (98% white British) participating in
the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Hair cortisol concentrations were determined from the scalp-
nearest 2 cm hair segment, and height, weight, and waist circumference were objectively measured.
Covariates included age, sex, socioeconomic status, smoking status, diabetes, and arthritis.
Results: In cross-sectional analyses, hair cortisol concentrations were positively correlated with weight
(r 5 0.102, P < 0.001), BMI (r 5 0.101, P < 0.001), and waist circumference (r 5 0.082, P 5 0.001) and were
significantly elevated in participants with obesity (BMI �30 kg/m2) (F 5 6.58, P 5 0.001) and raised waist cir-
cumference (�102 cm in men, �88 cm in women) (F 5 4.87, P 5 0.027). Hair cortisol levels were also posi-
tively associated with the persistence of obesity (F 5 12.70, P < 0.001), evaluated in retrospect over 4 years.
Conclusions: Chronic exposure to elevated cortisol concentrations, assessed in hair, is associated with
markers of adiposity and with the persistence of obesity over time.

Introduction
Obesity is one of the leading risk factors for mortality worldwide,
substantially increasing the risk of developing chronic diseases such
as heart disease and cancers (1); thus understanding the factors that
promote the onset or maintenance of obesity has important thera-
peutic implications. Obesity is often accompanied by a cluster of
comorbidities including hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance,
and dyslipidemia, known as the metabolic syndrome (2). The symp-
toms of the metabolic syndrome closely resemble those of Cushing’s
syndrome, a disorder characterized by extreme endogenous produc-
tion of the stress hormone cortisol (3). Cortisol has a broad range of
physiological effects throughout the human body and plays a role in
glucose and lipid metabolism, body composition, and immunosup-
pressive and anti-inflammatory responses (4). It is possible that
long-term
hyperactivation
of
the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) axis, the neuroendocrine system that regulates cortisol levels,
may contribute to the development of obesity and the metabolic syn-
drome in otherwise healthy individuals.
Exposure to a physiological or psychological stressor activates the
HPA axis, resulting in the release of cortisol. Chronic stress—and
thus chronically elevated levels of cortisol—may promote obesity
through effects on fat accumulation. The effects of cortisol are
mediated via glucocorticoid receptors, which have a particularly
high density in visceral adipose tissue. In the presence of insulin,
cortisol promotes triglyceride accumulation and retention in visceral
fat depots which results in increased abdominal fat (5). Indeed, ani-
mal studies have shown that chronic exposure to physical and psy-
chological stressors increases deposition of visceral fat (6,7).
In addition to influencing fat deposition, cortisol is associated with alter-
ations in the quantity and type of foods consumed. In animal models,
moderate and severe stressors (e.g., noise, immobilization) consistently
reduce food intake, whereas mild stressors (e.g., a tail pinch) are associ-
ated with increased or unchanged intake (8). Laboratory studies in
humans have shown increased ad libitum caloric intake in response to
glucocorticoid infusion and artificially induced stress (9,10). People tend
to report eating more when stressed (11,12), but some studies have

 observed reduced food intake in conditions of acute stress (13). In addi-
tion to absolute changes in energy intake, functional MRI studies have
indicated that the sensitivity of central food reward circuits is lower dur-
ing times of stress, which may increase cravings for “comfort foods”
(14). Under stress, there is a shift in preference toward more palatable,
energy-dense foods irrespective of whether total energy intake increases
(11,12,15). These observations are suggestive of a causal role of cortisol
in the development and maintenance of obesity.
Until recently, endocrine studies have predominantly relied on cortisol
assessments in saliva, urine, and blood. While these methods can be used
to accurately measure momentary cortisol concentrations at the time of
sampling, fluctuations in cortisol levels due to the circadian rhythm, pul-
satile secretion, and daily variation arising from situational factors (e.g.,
environmental stressors, diet, infection (16)) mean they are not well
suited for capturing long-term cortisol concentrations. Studies that have
used these methods to test for associations with adiposity have yielded
conflicting results and overall do not support a strong relationship
between systemic cortisol and obesity (17). Over the past decade, there
has been a sharp rise in studies using hair, which incorporates unbound
cortisol and other lipophilic substances, as a source for cortisol analyses.
Scalp hair grows at an average rate of 1 cm per month (18); thus a hair
sample of 1 cm is considered to represent mean exposure to free cortisol
over 1 month. Considerable evidence now supports the validity (19-21)
and test–retest reliability (22) of hair cortisol concentration as a marker
of long-term cortisol exposure, as well as its robustness to a range of
hair-related factors such as dyeing and other treatments (23).
In the past 5 years, a handful of cross-sectional studies have used hair
samples to investigate the relationship between chronic cortisol exposure
and adiposity, with mixed results. Several studies have reported positive
associations between hair cortisol concentrations and body mass index
(BMI) and waist circumference (21,24-30), but others have not shown
these correlations (21,31,32). Two studies have found elevated hair corti-
sol levels in adults with obesity relative to normal-weight and over-
weight comparisons (25,33), with similar findings observed in a large
sample of children (30). In another study in adults, participants in the
highest hair cortisol quartile had 2.4 times higher odds of the metabolic
syndrome (27). The majority of existing studies have been conducted in
relatively small samples with only one in adults and one in children hav-
ing a sample >1,000, and none to our knowledge has examined hair cor-
tisol levels in relation to adiposity using longitudinal data, which could
offer greater insight into the role of cortisol in the development and
maintenance of obesity.
The aim of this study was therefore to analyze associations between hair
cortisol concentration and adiposity using data from a large population-
based sample over 4 years. We examined cross-sectional associations
between hair cortisol and weight, BMI, waist circumference, weight sta-
tus (normal weight, overweight, obesity), and waist circumference cate-
gory (raised, not raised) and looked at how hair cortisol related to the
persistence of obesity over time. We hypothesized that greater and more
persistent adiposity would be associated with higher hair cortisol levels.
Method
Study population
Data were from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), a
longitudinal panel study of men and women aged 50 years and older
living in England. The study started in 2002, with participants recruited
from an annual cross-sectional survey of households and followed up
every 2 years. The sample is periodically refreshed to ensure the full age
range is maintained, and comparisons of sociodemographic characteris-
tics with the national census indicate that the sample is broadly represen-
tative of the English population (34). The general methods of data col-
lection are detailed at www.elsa-project.ac.uk. At each assessment,
participants complete an interview and questionnaires, and in alternate
(even) waves, nurse visits are conducted to obtain objective measure-
ments of health status, including height, weight, and waist circumfer-
ence. The wave 6 nurse visit included taking a hair sample to measure
cortisol. The present analyses used anthropometric data from waves 4
(2008/09) and 6 (2012/13) and data on hair cortisol from wave 6. Hair
analysis was carried out on a subset of the 9,169 core participants who
took part in wave 6, selected at random, because of financial constraints.
Data on hormone levels in hair were available for 2,685 individuals, of
whom 2,601 had detectible cortisol values. We excluded 74 cases with
missing data on BMI at wave 6, resulting in a final sample for analysis
of 2,527 men and women. Participants gave full informed consent and
ethical approval was obtained from the National Research Ethics
Service.
Hair sample collection and analysis
From all consenting participants, a lock of hair measuring at least
2 cm in length and weighing at least 10 mg was collected from the
posterior vertex, cut as close to the scalp as possible. Exclusion criteria
for hair sampling included pregnancy, breastfeeding, certain scalp
conditions, inability to sit with head remaining still, and having less
than 2 cm of hair length in the posterior vertex scalp area. Full details
of the hair sampling process are provided at http://www.elsa-project.
ac.uk/uploads/elsa/docs_w6/project_instructions_nurse.pdf. The wash
procedure and steroid extraction were undertaken using high perform-
ance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, as described by Gao
et al. (35). Based on an average monthly hair growth of approximately
1 cm (18), the scalp-nearest hair segment of 2 cm represents average
cortisol accumulated over an approximate time span of 2 months
before sampling. Hair-specific factors that could affect hair cortisol
concentration (dyeing or chemical treatment, such as perming or
chemical straightening) were assessed by self-report.
Measures of anthropometry
Weight was measured by nurses to the nearest 0.1 kg using portable
electronic scales, and height was measured to the nearest millimeter
using a portable stadiometer.
Waist circumference was measured at the midpoint between the lower
rib and the upper margin of the iliac crest using a tape with an inser-
tion buckle at one end. The measurement was taken twice, using the
same tape, and was recorded to the nearest even millimeter. Those
whose waist measurements differed by more than 3 cm had a third
measurement taken. The mean of the two valid measurements (the two
out of the three measurements that were closest to each other, if there
were three measurements) was used in the analyses.
Nurses recorded any factors that might have compromised the reli-
ability of the measurements (e.g., participant was stooped/unwilling
to remove shoes), and these cases were excluded. For longitudinal
analyses, we excluded cases with a weight change >10 kg if the
waist circumference change was not consistent.

 BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of
height in meters and weight status defined as underweight (BMI
<18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (BMI 18.5-25 kg/m2), overweight (BMI
25-29.9 kg/m2), or obesity (BMI �30 kg/m2). Raised waist circumfer-
ence, an indicator of abdominal obesity, was defined according to the
National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III
waist circumference cutoffs (�102 cm in men, �88 cm in women).
Other variables
Age, sex, and ethnicity (white/nonwhite) were included as control var-
iables, with household nonpension wealth used as an indicator of soci-
oeconomic status, because it has been identified as particularly rele-
vant to health outcomes in this age group (36). Wealth was
categorized into quintiles across all ELSA participants who took part
in wave 6. Smoking status was assessed with the question “Do you
smoke cigarettes at all nowadays?” (yes/no). Doctor-diagnosed arthri-
tis and diabetes were self-reported in response to being presented with
a list of conditions and being asked “Has a doctor ever told you that
you have (or have had) any of the conditions on this card?”
Statistical analysis
Analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 23. We used
weights to correct for sampling probabilities and for differential nonres-
ponse and to calibrate back to the 2011 National Census population dis-
tributions for age and sex. The weights accounted for the differential
probability of being included in wave 6 of ELSA and for nonparticipa-
tion in the nurse visit. Details can be found at http://doc.ukdataservice.

Hair cortisol data were log transformed to correct skewness. For descrip-
tive purposes, Table 1 provides information on means and standard devi-
ations (SD) in original units (pg/mg). We used anthropometric data from
wave 6 to examine partial correlations between hair cortisol levels and
continuous measures of weight, BMI, and waist circumference and used
ANCOVAs to analyze cross-sectional differences in mean hair cortisol
levels by weight status [normal weight, overweight, obesity (under-
weight participants were excluded from this analysis due to low numbers
(n5 26)] and waist circumference status (raised, not raised). We also
used longitudinal data from waves 4 and 6 to retrospectively explore
associations between hair cortisol and the persistence of obesity over 4
years (never had obesity, had obesity at one wave, had obesity at both
waves), using ANCOVAs to test for differences in mean hair cortisol
levels between groups. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity,
socioeconomic status (indicated by wealth quintile), hair treatment, and
smoking status, as these factors have been identified in the literature as
covariates for hair cortisol. We repeated the analyses adjusting for diabe-
tes and arthritis to test for potential confounding, since these health con-
ditions are known to be associated with both cortisol and BMI. We also
performed all analyses separately by sex to explore any sex differences,
but as there were no notable differences in results, we only present the
whole-sample analyses here.
Results
Descriptive information about the study sample
Demographic and anthropometric characteristics of the study sample
are shown in Table 1. Participants were on average 67.9 years old
(range 54-87), 59% were women, and 98% were white. Mean BMI was
28.2 kg/m2, 41% of participants had an overweight BMI, and a further
31% had obesity. Mean waist circumference was 96 cm (102 cm in
men, 92 cm in women); 10% of participants were current smokers,
41% had arthritis, and 10% had diabetes. Just over a third (36%) of the
sample reported having dyed or chemically treated hair.

Hair cortisol was significantly correlated with body weight (partial
r 5 0.102, P < 0.001), BMI (r 5 0.101, P < 0.001), and waist cir-
cumference (r 5 0.082, P < 0.001), with higher levels of cortisol
associated with greater adiposity. There were also significant associ-
ations between hair cortisol and weight status (F 5 6.58, P 5 0.001)

 (Figure 1) and waist circumference status (F 5 4.87, P 5 0.027)
(Figure 2). Participants who had obesity had significantly higher
mean hair cortisol concentrations than normal-weight (mean log val-
ues 0.983 vs. 0.862, P 5 0.001) or overweight participants (0.983 vs.
0.904, P 5 0.031). The normal-weight and overweight groups did
not differ significantly in their mean hair cortisol concentrations
(0.862 vs. 0.904, P 5 0.579). Similarly, mean hair cortisol levels
were elevated in participants with a raised waist circumference com-
pared with participants with a waist circumference in the healthy
range (0.941 vs. 0.883, P 5 0.027).
Hair cortisol and the persistence of obesity
In addition to cross-sectional associations, hair cortisol was also ret-
rospectively associated with the persistence of obesity in a subsam-
ple of participants with anthropometric data over a 4-year period
(n 5 1,421). Mean hair cortisol increased linearly with the number
of waves of obesity (BMI �30 kg/m2), from a mean log value of
0.870 in participants who did not have obesity at either time point
(n 5 1,011) to 0.998 in those who had obesity at one time
point (n 5 92) and 1.074 in those who had obesity at both time
points (n 5 318; F 5 12.70, P < 0.001; Figure 3). Post hoc compari-
sons indicated a significant difference between the group who never
had obesity and the group who had obesity at both times (P <
0.001), but differences between the group who had obesity at just
one wave and the other two groups did not reach statistical signifi-
cance. Within the group who had obesity at just one time point,
there was no significant difference in mean hair cortisol between
those who had obesity at the first wave (n 5 47) and those who had
obesity at the second wave (n 5 45; mean log values 1.050 vs. 0.942
respectively, P 5 0.444).
Adjustment for associated health conditions
Hair cortisol concentrations were slightly higher in participants with
diabetes (mean log values 0.991 vs. 0.907, F 5 3.78, P 5 0.052) but
did not differ by arthritis status after adjustment for covariates
(mean log values 0.926 vs. 0.910, F 5 0.35, P 5 0.557). Replicating
our analyses with additional adjustment for patient-reported diabetes
and arthritis had little effect on the results. Cross-sectional associa-
tions remained significant between hair cortisol levels and weight
(r 5 0.096, P < 0.001), BMI (r 5 0.095, P < 0.001), waist cir-
cumference (r 5 0.075, P 5 0.001), and weight status (F 5 5.50,
P 5 0.004). The association with waist circumference status became
nonsignificant (F 5 3.67, P 5 0.056). The association with persist-
ence of obesity was also significant after adjustment for arthritis and
diabetes (F 5 10.78, P < 0.001).
Discussion
This study examined associations between long-term cortisol levels,
as assessed in hair, and adiposity in a large population-based sam-
ple. In cross-sectional analyses, hair cortisol concentrations were
positively correlated with body weight, BMI, and waist circumfer-
ence and were significantly elevated in participants with obesity and

 raised waist circumference. In retrospective longitudinal analyses,
hair cortisol levels were also significantly associated with the per-
sistence of obesity over 4 years. Results were robust to adjustment
for a range of sociodemographic and health-related variables.
Previous studies examining relations between cortisol and adipos-
ity have largely relied on measurements of cortisol in serum,
saliva, or urine, which vary according to the time of day and a
range of other situational factors (16). The analysis of cortisol in
scalp hair reflects systemic cortisol exposure over a prolonged
period—in this study, 2 months—and is therefore not affected by
the timing of sample collection or acute stress. Consequently, using
hair samples to assess cortisol offers a particularly well-suited
method for investigating the effects of long-term cortisol levels in
epidemiological studies.
A few small studies have assessed cortisol in scalp hair in relation
to BMI, and their results have been mixed. For example, Stalder
et al. reported a strong association between hair cortisol and BMI in
two independent studies (n 5 58-155) that remained significant even
when the analysis was restricted to participants without obesity (26)
and observed a similar association in a large workplace study
(n 5 1,258) (27). However, neither Manenschijn et al. (21) (n 5 205)
nor Feller et al. (28) (n 5 654) found long-term cortisol levels to be
significantly related to BMI, despite being correlated with waist cir-
cumference. Olstad et al. (32) found no relation between BMI and
hair cortisol in women (n 5 70) or children (n 5 30) living in disad-
vantaged neighborhoods, although BMI was significantly associated
with perceived stress. In a much larger, nationally representative
sample, we observed a significant positive correlation between BMI
and hair cortisol concentration. A significant association between
hair cortisol and BMI has also very recently been observed in a
large sample of 6-year-old children (n 5 3,019) (30). The correlation
between waist circumference, an indicator of visceral fat, and long-
term cortisol has been more consistently reported across previous
studies (21,24,27-29). We also demonstrated a significant association
between a raised waist circumference, a proxy for abdominal obe-
sity, and hair cortisol.
A handful of studies have observed an association between long-
term cortisol and obesity, as we did in this study. Wester et al. (33)
found that patients with obesity (n 5 47) being evaluated in an obe-
sity center had significantly higher hair cortisol levels than normal-
weight (n 5 41) and overweight controls (n 5 87), but there was no
significant difference between the normal-weight and overweight
groups. Similar results have been observed in samples of young shift
and day workers (25) and children (24,30). Our study extends previ-
ous work by using data from two time points, 4 years apart, to retro-
spectively assess the relation between hair cortisol and the persist-
ence of obesity. We found a linear association between the number
of waves of obesity (0, 1, or 2) and hair cortisol levels: mean corti-
sol was lowest in individuals who did not have obesity at either
time point, higher in those who had obesity at just one time point,
and highest in those who had obesity at both times. This suggests
that chronic high-level cortisol exposure may play a role in the
maintenance of obesity. However, it is important to note that as
BMI measurements preceded the cortisol measurement, a reverse
association is also possible whereby persistent obesity could play a
role in the elevation of cortisol levels, for example through altered
metabolism.
Just one study to our knowledge that has examined hair cortisol in
relation to multiple measures of adiposity has failed to find any evi-
dence of an association (31). The authors attributed the null findings
to the elderly sample (n 5 283), given known changes in body fat
distribution with aging (37). However, in a more recent, larger study
of middle-aged and older adults (n 5 654), waist circumference and
waist-to-hip ratio (but not BMI) were significantly associated with
hair cortisol concentrations (28). This study’s sample also comprised
middle-aged and older adults and we observed significant relations
between hair cortisol and all markers of adiposity. Whether the asso-
ciations between cortisol and adiposity differ by age is an issue that
requires further exploration.
This study has several strengths. Data were from a large, well-
characterized, nationally representative sample of middle-aged and
older men and women. This is an advantage over previous studies
that have used smaller convenience samples. We used anthropomet-
ric data that were objectively measured by trained research nurses
rather than relying on self-reports. The mean BMI and prevalence of
overweight and obesity in our sample were comparable to age-
matched estimates from the 2012 Health Survey for England (38).
Availability of data on BMI at multiple time points allowed for
analysis of hair cortisol in relation to the persistence of obesity over
time, which to our knowledge has not previously been done. We
controlled for a range of potential behavioral and health-related
confounders.
There were also limitations. Data were from an older population, in
which levels of cortisol may differ relative to younger adults (28),
and the sample was almost exclusively white, so findings cannot be
assumed to generalize. Data on cortisol were only available for a
subset of the full ELSA sample, but the sample that provided hair
samples was selected at random. Our analyses did not account for
use of medications that might influence cortisol concentration, such
as oral, intra-articular, or local glucocorticoids. A key limitation is
that hair samples were only collected in the most recent health
examination. This is because the sampling of cortisol in hair was
not widely known in 2008 when the previous health examination
was conducted. It is not currently known whether chronically ele-
vated cortisol levels are a cause or consequence of obesity, and
since it was not possible to analyze anthropometric changes over
time in relation to baseline hair cortisol level in this study, we were
not able to draw conclusions on causality. Longitudinal studies are
required to shed light on the direction of associations between corti-
sol and adiposity. However, evidence from the clinical literature
showing that extreme conditions of hypercortisolism (Cushing’s
syndrome) and hypocortisolism (Addison’s disease) lead to central
obesity and weight loss, respectively (39), suggests that increased
systemic cortisol exposure may be the driving force behind this
association. If this is found to be the case, targeting cortisol levels
may offer a novel method for treating obesity (40).
To conclude, these results provide consistent evidence that long-
term exposure to elevated levels of cortisol over several months is
associated with higher levels of adiposity. Hair cortisol offers a suit-
able and easily obtainable measure for assessing chronically elevated
cortisol concentrations in obesity research and may therefore aid in
further advancing understanding in this area. While cross-sectional
studies have provided a good starting point from which to explore
the role of HPA axis dysregulation and chronic cortisol exposure in
