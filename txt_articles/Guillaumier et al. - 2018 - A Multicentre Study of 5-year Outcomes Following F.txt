Abstract
Background: Clinically significant nonmetastatic prostate cancer (PCa) is currently
treated using whole-gland therapy. This approach is effective but can have urinary,
sexual, and rectal side effects.
Objective: To report on 5-yr PCa control following focal high-intensity focused ultra-
sound (HIFU) therapy to treat individual areas of cancer within the prostate.
Design, setting, and participants: This was a prospective study of 625 consecutive
patients with nonmetastatic clinically significant PCa undergoing focal HIFU therapy
(Sonablate) in secondary care centres between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2015. A
minimum of 6-mo follow-up was available for599 patients. Intermediate- or high-risk
PCa was found in 505 patients (84%).
Intervention: Disease was localised using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging
(mpMRI) combined with targeted and systematic biopsies, or transperineal mapping
biopsies. Areas of significant disease were treated. Follow-up included prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) measurement, mpMRI, and biopsies.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The primary endpoint, failure-free
survival (FFS), was defined as freedom from radical or systemic therapy, metastases,
and cancer-specific mortality.
Results and limitations: The median follow-up was 56 mo (interquartile range [IQR] 35–
70). The median age was 65 yr (IQR 61–71) and median preoperative PSA was 7.2 ng/ml
(IQR 5.2–10.0). FFS was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI] 98–100%) at 1 yr, 92% (95% CI 90–
95%) at 3 yr, and 88% (95% 85–91%) at 5 yr. For the whole patient cohort, metastasis-free,
cancer-specific, and overall survival at 5 yr was 98% (95% CI 97–99%),100%, and 99% (95% CI
97–100%), respectively. Among patients who returned validated questionnaires, 241/247

 1. 
Introduction
The therapeutic approach to nonmetastatic prostate cancer is
an outlier compared to strategies for other solid organ
cancers. Regardless of the burden or location of cancer within
the gland, treatment is directed at the whole gland using
surgery or radiotherapy. While both approaches are effective,
they can be associated with urinary incontinence and erectile
dysfunction, with radiotherapy occasionally causing rectal
side effects [1–3]. While current trends demonstrate that
radical therapy is increasingly used among the patients most
likely to benefit from treatment with respect to better cancer-
specific survival [4], there is still a need to reduce treatment-
related side effects, particularly as the survival benefit
conferred by radical treatment is often seen over 10–15 yr
when compared to a strategy of active monitoring [5].
The aim of focal therapy is to reduce side effects and
maintain cancer control by targeting areas of known cancer
in a similar approach to that for other solid organ cancers
[6–8]. This concept of tissue preservation has come about
through improvements in disease localisation using multi-
parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and
mapping biopsy techniques [9]. However, many studies
have hitherto been small, based in expert centres, or subject
to short follow-up [10–18]. The only randomised study to
evaluate focal therapy recruited patients with low-risk
disease [19], a population known to have little to no chance
of metastases or cancer-related mortality.
We now report on medium-term cancer control out-
comes in a large multicentre patient cohort with clinically
significant nonmetastatic prostate cancer treated with focal
therapy using high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU).
2. 
Patients and methods
Institutional review board exemption was granted by University College
London Hospital for our health technology assessment programme,
which 
followed 
guidelines 
for 
evaluating 
surgical 
interventions
[20,21]. Focal HIFU commenced in 2006 in the UK with approval for
clinical use by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
(NICE) under special arrangements. All cases had to be prospectively and
consecutively entered into an academic registry, discussed in a
multidisciplinary meeting, and given written information on the
advantages and disadvantages of the procedure. We previously reported
on medium-term outcomes following whole-gland HIFU [22]. Between
January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2015, 625 consecutive patients
underwent primary focal HIFU using a Sonablate 500 device (Sonacare
Inc., Charlotte, NC, USA) in nine centres. Focal HIFU treatment was
offered to patients diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer of
Gleason score 6–9 and stage T1c–3bN0M0 and prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) of �30 ng/ml. Gleason 6 disease required a minimum of 4 mm of
cancer [23]. Patients were classified into D’Amico low-, intermediate-,
and high-risk groups [24].
Disease was localised using mpMRI combined with targeted and
systematic 
biopsies, 
or 
transperineal 
mapping 
biopsies. 
Targeted
biopsies involved taking three to six biopsy cores from all lesions with
a Likert score of 3–5, as well as systematic biopsies (transperineal or
transrectal). Mapping biopsies involved taking biopsy cores every 5 mm.
Intermediate- and high-risk cases also underwent a radioisotope bone
scan and/or cross-sectional computed tomography to rule out distant
metastases, depending on local institution guidelines.
All surgeons underwent a rigorous period of training involving online
learning, observation of five cases on two separate occasions in an expert
centre, and on-site proctoring by an expert urologist for five to ten cases,
and were followed by an expert clinical applications specialist for all
subsequent treatments.
There were various forms of focal HIFU permitted (Fig. 1). Up to two
retreatments with focal HIFU were allowed. All men were advised to
undergo 3–6-monthly PSA testing, with mpMRI routinely performed at
1 yr and every 1–2 yr. Two rises in PSA after the nadir, without
predefining the magnitude of the rise, were investigated using prostate
biopsy or mpMRI followed by biopsy if the mpMRI was suspicious. We
have previously reported on the high negative predictive value of mpMRI
following focal-HIFU [23,25].
Repeat HIFU was offered when either (1) clinically significant cancer
on biopsy occurred in field or out of field and mpMRI staging indicated
that the disease was still localised, or (2) when mpMRI demonstrated
clear in-field recurrence (mpMRI Likert score 5) associated with a rising
PSA. Patients were routinely offered the option of radical prostatectomy
or radical radiotherapy.
Physicians assessed postoperative adverse events during follow-up
clinic visits. Functional outcomes were assessed via patient-reported
outcome measures using validated questionnaires collected at 1–2 and 2–3
yr after focal HIFU treatment. Validated questionnaires included the
International Prostate Symptom Score [26] and the Expanded Prostate
Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) urinary continence domain [27]. All data
were audited and quality controlled by two data managers (N.M. and F.H.J.).
2.1. 
Primary outcome
Failure-free survival (FFS) was defined as avoidance of local salvage
therapy (surgery or radiotherapy), systemic therapy, metastases, and
prostate cancer–specific death. This excluded PSA kinetics, as there are
no kinetic measures that are valid in this setting.
(98%) achieved complete pad-free urinary continence and none required more than 1 pad/
d. Limitations include the lack of long-term follow-up.
Conclusions: Focal therapy for select patients with clinically significant nonmetastatic
prostate cancer is effective in the medium term and has a low probability of side effects.
Patient summary: In this multicentre study of 625 patients undergoing focal therapy
using high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), failure-free survival, metastasis-free
survival, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival were 88%, 98%, 100%, and 99%,
respectively. Urinary incontinence (any pad use) was 2%. Focal HIFU therapy for patients
with clinically significant prostate cancer that has not spread has a low probability of side
effects and is effective at 5 yr.

 2.2. 
Secondary outcomes
Our main secondary outcomes included metastasis-free survival and
prostate cancer–specific and overall mortality. We also report biopsy
outcomes when carried out, as well as adverse events and side effects.
Urinary continence was defined as being completely pad-free and
socially continent (0–1 pads/d). The latter definition is commonly used in
many series reporting radical prostatectomy outcomes [28]. We also
report on complete pad-free, leak-free urinary continence. In addition,
we evaluated whether certain baseline factors might predict for FFS.

 2.3. 
Statistical analysis
As this was a cohort registry study, there were no a priori sample size
calculations. Our decision to analyse and publish these data was based on
the registry being open for 10 yr and the availability of median follow-up
of approximately 5 yr for the cohort. Baseline characteristics are
presented as the median (interquartile range [IQR]) or proportion, as
appropriate. Kaplan-Meier estimates of time-to-event outcomes are
described with 95% confidence interval (CI) for those men with at least 6-
mo follow-up. Adverse events are reported as proportions only, and for
these the entire cohort was included to reduce selection bias. Urinary
continence was evaluated using the EPIC urinary continence domain
with a pad-free definition and a socially continent definition (0–1 pads).
Cox regression was used to determine whether baseline factors could
predict FFS. The univariable analysis included age, prostate volume, PSA,
Gleason score, and clinical T stage. For multivariable analysis, significant
factors (p < 0.05) were included (Supplementary Table 1). R version
3.4.2 was used for all statistical analyses. (R Foundation for Statistical
Computing, Vienna, Austria; www.R-project.org) The discriminative
ability of the model was measured using Harrell's c statistic. The model
was recalculated using 2000 bootstrap resamples to account for
optimism, after which the c statistic was adjusted. The c statistic is
comparable to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
for survival models.

Results
3.1. 
Baseline demographics
A total of 625 patients were treated with focal HIFU, of
whom 599 reached at least 6-mo follow-up and 505 (84%)
had intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer (Table 1).
Table 2 lists the biopsy characteristics. When excluding
patients with an event (n = 60) the median follow-up was
56 mo (IQR 35–70).
3.2. 
Primary outcome
The FFS at 1, 3, and 5 yr was 99% (95% CI 98–100%), 92% (95%
CI 90–95%), and 88% (95% CI 85–91%), respectively (Table 3).
Kaplan-Meier estimates at 5 yr were 96% (95% CI 91–100%),
88% (95% CI 84–93%), and 84% (95% CI 78–90%) for low-,
intermediate. and high-risk groups, respectively (Table 3
and Fig. 2).
3.3. 
Secondary outcomes
Following focal HIFU, eight patients transitioned to salvage
radical prostatectomy, 36 had salvage external beam
radiotherapy, 
and 
one 
received 
androgen 
deprivation
therapy. Ten patients experienced metastases during the
follow-up, of whom two had low-risk, four had intermedi-
ate-risk, 
and 
four 
had 
high-risk 
disease; 
three 
had
metastases after the second HIFU treatment. Kaplan-Meier
estimates for metastasis-free survival at 1, 3, and 5 yr were
99.7% (95% CI 99–100%), 99% (95% CI 98–100%), and 98%
(95% CI 97–99%), respectively (Table 3). There were seven
deaths, none of which was related to prostate cancer.
Kaplan-Meier estimates for overall survival at 1, 3, and 5 yr
were 100% (95% CI 99–100%), 99% (95% CI 98–100%), and
99% (95% CI 97–100%), respectively. At least one repeat focal
HIFU treatment was performed in 121 patients (one repeat
HIFU in 112 and two repeat HIFU in 9).
A total of 222 patients underwent biopsy following focal
HIFU. Of these, 111 were within our three earlier phase 1/2
studies [13–15] and 111 had for-cause biopsies as a result of

 rising PSA and/or suspicious mpMRI after focal HIFU.
Overall, 29 men had histological in-field recurrence on
biopsy, while 16 had histological evidence of out-of-field de
novo cancer or progression of untreated low-risk disease. A
further 11 patients had both in-field and out-of-field disease
on biopsy.
No patients had bleeding requiring intervention or
transfusion. Within 6 mo of treatment, postoperative
urinary tract infection and epididymo-orchitis occurred in
53/625 
(8.5%) 
and 
12/625 
cases 
(1.9%), 
respectively.
Endoscopic interventions for lower urinary tract symptoms
at any time point were required in 60/625 men (9.6%). There
were two (0.3%) recto-urethral fistulae. One of these cases
healed following urinary diversion using urethral and
suprapubic catheters for 6 mo but no bowel diversion.
The other required open reconstructive surgery because of
failure of conservative management (Table 4).
Baseline urinary continence status was reported by
421 men using the EPIC urinary domain questionnaire. At
1–2 and 2–3 yr after focal HIFU, pad-free status was
available at both baseline and follow-up for 313 and
247 men, respectively; 304 (97%) and 241 (98%) were
pad-free (0 pads) at these two time points. No men required
more than 1 pad/d, so social continence was achieved in
100%. At 1–2 and 2–3 yr after focal HIFU, pad-free, leak-free
status at both baseline and follow-up was available for
250 and 195 men, respectively; 208 (83%) and 156 (80%)
were pad-free, leak-free continent at these two time points
(Table 5).
In both univariable and multivariable analyses, only pre-
HIFU PSA and stage T3 were significant in relation to failure,
with multivariable hazard ratios of 1.04 (95% CI 1.01–1.07;
p = 0.004) and 3.06 (95% CI 1.11–8.44; p = 0.03), respectively
(Supplementary Table 1). The uncorrected c statistic was
0.67; after correction for optimism, the value was 0.66.
4. 
Discussion
Our study shows that following focal HIFU, failure-free
survival was 88% at 5 yr. Metastasis-free survival was 98%
and cancer-specific survival was 100% at 5 yr. Only 2% had
urinary incontinence requiring use of one daily pad and no
men required more than 1 pad/d. Bowel complications were
rare (0.3%).
The strengths of our study lie in its large and multicentre
nature, with medium-term follow-up data prospectively
collected in a nationally mandated registry and with
independent quality control of data entry against source
records. We predominantly treated patients with clinically
significant prostate cancer, for whom it is widely accepted
that treatment is required because of a higher risk of
progression on active surveillance.
While it is accepted that whole-gland radical prostatec-
tomy and radical radiotherapy are effective in treating
clinically significant nonmetastatic prostate cancer, these
modalities involve significant probabilities of urinary and
sexual side effects, and some bowel toxicity in the case of
radiotherapy. Focal therapy, by treating known areas of
cancer with a margin, aims to preserve prostate tissue and
minimise damage to the neurovascular bundles, bladder
neck, external urethral sphincter, and rectum. We have
shown that this strategy has a low probability of treatment-
related side effects and achieves good cancer control in the
medium term. Despite the absence of long-term follow-up,
we find these results reassuring and acceptable considering
that we predominantly used focal HIFU in intermediate-
and high-risk cancer.
Focal therapy using various energy modalities has been
evaluated in single-arm retrospective and prospective
studies. Recent systematic reviews have shown that focal
therapy has a minimal impact on quality of life, and while
oncological effectiveness is yet to be established, genitouri-
nary function is well preserved [8,29].
Most of our low-risk cases were historical from a time
when active surveillance for such disease was still ques-
tioned and it was deemed appropriate to offer these men
focal HIFU as an alternative to radical therapy. Nonetheless,
these cases still required a minimum amount of Gleason
6 cancer to qualify. Our UK focal HIFU programme now does
not allow treatment in instances of low-volume Gleason
6 disease because the probability of progression for such
lesions is rare, unless there are extenuating circumstances
such as psychological distress to the patient due to being on
active surveillance or family history [30]. This stance
contrasts with some other studies that have predominantly

cers are currently being piloted [31]. However, because of
previous problems in maintaining physician and patient
equipoise in 11 failed randomised comparative trials
comparing different interventions for localised prostate
cancer, this might not be possible to deliver [32]. Even if
randomisation could be delivered, the sample size would
have to be based on a noninferiority design that might
require 
between 
2000 
and 
8000 
patients 
recruited,
randomised and followed up over 10–15 yr, depending on
the noninferiority margin used.
However, other treatments such as prostate brachyther-
apy and robotic prostatectomy have been approved for

 clinical use without or before the completion of randomised
comparative studies. Partial nephrectomy for the treatment
of renal cancer is another example. Such changes in practice
were often based on medium-term outcomes from cohort
studies because the long natural history of prostate cancer
and small renal tumours made it unfeasible to deliver
randomised controlled trials. In this context, physicians and
health care organisations will need to consider whether it is
justified to insist on randomised comparative data for focal
therapy compared to radical therapy powered on mortality
and metastases. On the basis of our data, patients currently
diagnosed with prostate cancer that is suitable for focal
therapy may prefer to have the option to choose whole-
gland radical therapy or focal therapy.
4.1. 
Limitations
We accept that there are some limitations to our study.
First, since our prospective registry was embedded in
clinical care, not all patients were routinely biopsied after
treatment. We validated the role of mpMRI for follow-up
after focal-HIFU compared to prostate biopsy and showed
that the negative predictive value for mpMRI in this setting
is �95% for clinically significant prostate cancer [25]. Sec-
ond, in light of not having a validated and accepted cancer
control measure, we considered a clinically meaningful
composite outcome measure that reflects the recent
Intermediate 
Clinical 
Endpoint 
in 
Carcinoma 
of 
the
Prostate consensus findings [33]. Finally, validated ques-
tionnaire data were not available for all patients owing to
our reliance on postal return of questionnaires. While we
used the International Index of Erectile Function (5-item)
questionnaire, these data were unavailable at the time of
analysis.

Conclusions
Focal therapy using HIFU could be offered to select patients
with clinically significant nonmetastatic prostate cancer as
it is effective in the medium term and has a low probability
of urinary and rectal side effects.

Urology Association Annual meeting.
