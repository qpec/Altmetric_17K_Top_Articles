Abstract
Background: The effect of loop diuretic use in critically ill patients on vasopressor support or in shock is unclear.
This study aimed to explore the relationship between loop diuretic use and hospital mortality in critically ill patients
with vasopressor support.
Methods: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database. Adult patients
with records of vasopressor use within 48 h after intensive care unit admission were screened. Multivariable logistic
regression and propensity score matching was used to investigate any association.
Results: Data on 7828 patients were included. The crude hospital mortality was significantly lower in patients with
diuretic use (166/1469 vs. 1171/6359, p < 0.001). In the extended multivariable logistic models, the odds ratio (OR) of
diuretic use was consistently significant in all six models (OR range 0.56–0.75, p < 0.05 for all). In the subgroup analysis,
an interaction effect was detected between diuretic use and fluid balance (FB). In the positive FB subgroup, diuretic
use was significantly associated with decreased mortality (OR 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51–0.78) but was
insignificant in the negative FB subgroup. In the other subgroups of mean arterial pressure, maximum sequential organ
failure assessment score, and lactate level, the association between diuretic use and mortality remained significant and
no interaction was detected. After propensity score matching, 1463 cases from each group were well matched. The
mortality remained significantly lower in the diuretic use group (165/1463 vs. 231/1463, p < 0.001).
Conclusions: Although residual confounding cannot be excluded, loop diuretic use is associated with lower mortality.

Background
Optimizing fluid status is fundamental in critical care
but is challenging to achieve. Sufficient fluid resuscita-
tion is crucial in stabilizing the hemodynamic status of
patients, and largely depends on large-volume fluid ad-
ministration. Additionally, a positive correlation between
fluid overload and adverse outcomes has been reported
in various diseases, such as sepsis [1, 2], acute lung in-
jury [3], and acute kidney injury (AKI) [4].
Loop diuretics are commonly prescribed to alleviate fluid
overload. However, their efficacy and safety remain unclear.
Several studies have shown that diuretics may induce
oxidative stress and further aggravate renal injury in pa-
tients with severe AKI [5, 6]. However, a pilot randomized
controlled trial (RCT) failed to confirm any specific incre-
mental risk with furosemide use in AKI patients [7].
Furthermore, Grams et al. found that diuretic therapy was
associated with improved survival in AKI patients [8].
Despite these contradictory conclusions, loop diuretics are
still widely used in clinical practice to increase urine output
(UO) and reduce the rate of edema. In a large survey of
critically ill patients, diuretics were prescribed in more than
50% of the population during intensive care unit (ICU) stay
[9]. Another large online questionnaire survey also reported
that furosemide was commonly used, especially in critically
ill patients with positive fluid balance (FB) and acute pul-
monary edema [10]. In clinical situations, a patient’s
hemodynamic status may become relatively stable with

 vasopressor support after adequate fluid resuscitation. One
major concern is that diuretic use may induce hypovolemia
and further compromise the hemodynamic status, and it
remains unclear if diuretics can alleviate the detrimental ef-
fects of excessive fluid accumulation in these patients.
This study aimed to explore the relationship between
diuretic use and hospital mortality in critically ill pa-
tients on vasopressor support, using logistic regression
and propensity score matching (PSM). Subgroup analysis
was also performed to investigate the interaction effect
between diuretic use and other potential covariates.
Methods
Database introduction
All the data in the current study were extracted from an
online international database— Medical Information
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III)—that was pub-
lished by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
with approval from the review boards of the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology and Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center [11]. All the patients in the database
were de-identified for privacy protection, and the need
for informed consent was waived. One author (Y S) ob-
tained access to this database (certification number
1564657) and was responsible for data extraction.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Adult patients with medical records indicating any vaso-
pressor use within 48 h after ICU admission were initially
screened. The recorded vasopressors included dobuta-
mine, dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, vasopres-
sin, and phenylephrine. Patients who were younger than
18 years or spent less than 48 h in the ICU were excluded.
For patients who were admitted to the ICU more than
once, only the first ICU stay was considered.
Data extraction
Data on the demographic characteristics, comorbidities,
laboratory outcomes, diuretic use, FB, mean arterial pres-
sure (MAP), and disease severity score were extracted
from the database. Diuretic use was defined as the use of
any loop diuretic within 48 h after ICU admission, includ-
ing furosemide, torasemide, and bumetanide. Vasopressor
use was defined as the use of any vasopressor agent, in-
cluding norepinephrine, epinephrine, dobutamine, dopa-
mine, vasopressin, and phenylephrine, within 48 h after
ICU admission.
Stratification and outcome definition
Subgroup analysis was performed to explore the possible
interaction between diuretic use and hemodynamic indi-
ces as well as disease severity. Stratification was performed
according to the FB status within 48 h after ICU admis-
sion (≥ or < 0 ml/kg/48 h), mean MAP (≥ or < 70 mmHg),
median value of maximum sequential organ failure assess-
ment (SOFA) score during ICU stay (≥ or < 10), and me-
dian value of maximum lactate level during ICU stay (≥ or
< 2.7 mmol/L). The primary endpoint was hospital mor-
tality. AKI was defined as a 1.5-fold increase in serum cre-
atinine (sCr) level during the ICU stay relative to baseline
sCr level, according to the creatinine-based Kidney Dis-
ease Improving Global Outcomes criteria, without urine
output [12, 13]. For patients without previous sCr data, it
was estimated using the following formula [14]: sCr = 0.74
– 0.2 (if female) + 0.08 (if black) + 0.0039 × age (in years).
Propensity score matching
PSM [15] was used to minimize the effect of confound-
ing factors such as hemodynamic indices and disease se-
verity, which may lead to outcome bias. The propensity
score was assigned based on the probability that a pa-
tient would receive diuretic therapy and estimated using
a multivariable logistic regression model. A one-to-one
nearest neighbor matching algorithm was applied using
a caliper width of 0.05. The following variables were se-
lected to generate the propensity score: age, weight, dia-
betes mellitus, hypertension, cardiac disease, AKI, SOFA
score on ICU admission, white blood cells, fluid intake
volume, and proportions of different vasopressors. Ker-
nel density plots of the p score were used to examine
the PSM degree. Finally, 1463 matched pairs were gener-
ated and applied to further analyses.
Management of missing data
Variables with missing data are common in the MIMIC
III database. For serum lactate and albumin values, more
than 20% were missing and were removed from this ana-
lysis. For other continuous variables with missing values
less than 5%, the missing values were replaced by the
mean or median values.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± standard de-
viation or median (interquartile range), as appropriate. The
student’s t test, analysis of variance, Wilcoxon rank-sum
test, or Kruskal-Wallis test was used, as appropriate.
Categorical data are expressed as proportions and com-
pared using the χ2 test. An extended logistic model ap-
proach was used for covariate adjustment: as hemodynamic
indices such as FB, MAP, and serum lactate level and dis-
ease severity are important factors affecting the decision to
use diuretics in clinical practice, subgroup analyses were
performed as described above. Multicollinearity was tested
using the variance inflation factor (VIF) method, with a
VIF ≥ 5 indicating the presence of multicollinearity. Good-
ness of fit tests were applied to all logistic regression
models. PSM was used to minimize the imbalance between
groups. A two-tailed test was performed, and p < 0.05 was

 considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses
were performed using Stata 11.2 (Stata Corp., College Sta-
tion, TX, USA).
Results
Baseline characteristics
Data on 7828 patients were included. The flow chart of
patient selection is presented in Fig. 1. The comparisons
of the baseline characteristics are listed in Table 1. The
overall hospital mortality rate was 17.1%. The difference
in MAP was small between the groups (74.6 ± 8.2 vs. 73.0
± 7.1, p < 0.001), and the trends of the average hourly
MAP are presented in Fig. 2. The SOFA score on
admission was also relatively similar in the diuretic use
and no diuretic use groups (6 (4–8) vs. 6 (4–9), p = 0.012).
The fluid intake within 48 h was significantly higher in
patients with no diuretic use (113.8 ± 77.1 vs. 95.5 ± 55.6,
p < 0.002) while the UO volume was similar across the
groups despite statistical significance (48.5 ± 38.2 vs. 51.2
± 28.4, p = 0.009). However, the hospital mortality was sig-
nificantly lower in patients with diuretic use (166/1469 vs.
1171/6359, p < 0.001). Additional baseline information, in-
cluding the doses and proportions of different vasopres-
sors, is presented in Additional file 1 (Table S1).
Association between diuretic use and hospital mortality
In the extended multivariable logistic models (Table 2),
we observed that the odds ratio (OR) of diuretic use was
consistently significant in all six models (OR range 0.56–
0.75, p < 0.05 for all). Subgroup analysis was performed
according to the FB, MAP, maximum SOFA score, and
lactate level (Fig. 3). The OR of diuretic use was signifi-
cant in the MAP subgroups (≥ 70 mmHg: OR 0.70, 95%
confidence
interval
(CI)
0.55–0.88,
p = 0.002;
< 70
mmHg: OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.36–0.70, p < 0.001), SOFA
score (≥ 10: OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.51–0.77, p < 0.001; < 10:
OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.33–0.86, p = 0.010), and lactate level
(≥ 2.7: OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.35–0.57, p < 0.001; < 2.7: OR
0.69, 95% CI 0.51–0.94, p = 0.020), and no significant
interaction was observed. However, in the FB subgroups, an
interactive effect was detected (p value for interaction,
0.038). In the positive FB group, diuretic use was significantly
associated with decreased mortality (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.51–
0.78, p < 0.001), and insignificantly associated with it in the
negative FB group (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.47–1.14, p = 0.170).
Outcomes after propensity score matching
After PSM, 1463 cases from each group were well
matched by a 1:1 matching algorithm (Table 3). The
overall quality of the matched sample was assessed by
comparing the standardized difference of the means and
the ratio of the variances between the propensity scores
of both groups as well as by graphically inspecting the
propensity scores between the groups (Additional file 1:
Figure S1). There was no significant difference between
the two matched groups with regards to all twelve
covariates, including fluid intake (94.1 ± 57.4 vs. 95.6 ±
55.7, p = 0.483) and proportions of different vasopressors.
Among the 1463 propensity-matched pairs, we found that
the hospital mortality was significantly lower in the diur-
etic use group (165/1463 vs. 231/1463, p < 0.001). The UO
volume was significantly higher in the diuretic use group
(51.3 ± 28.5 vs. 44.5 ± 28.6, p < 0.001), and the mean MAP
was comparable (73.0 ± 7.1 vs. 74.5 ± 7.8, p < 0.001).
Sensitivity analysis
Vasopressin (despite weak recommendations in the sep-
sis guidelines) and phenylephrine are usually not used as
first-line vasopressors. For example, some vasopressors
may be used in patients during postoperative recovery
from anesthesia, and vasopressin may be prescribed for
gastrointestinal bleeding instead of septic shock. To test
the robustness of our findings, we performed a sensitiv-
ity analysis excluding these two vasopressors. The out-
comes remained stable after adjustment for confounders
(Additional file 1: Table S2) and in the comparisons after
PSM (Additional file 1: Table S3).
Discussion
The present study demonstrates that in critically ill pa-
tients with vasopressor use the use of diuretics is associ-
ated with significantly decreased hospital mortality. This
result was robust in the PSM analysis after adjustment
for covariates and remained consistent in the subgroups
of MAP, lactate level, and SOFA score. Unexpectedly, an
interaction was detected between FB and diuretic use. A
potential benefit was only observed in patients with

 positive FB; this benefit was insignificant in the negative
FB subgroup. Our findings are suggestive of a possible
beneficial role for diuretics in patients with vasopressor
use, which has not been previously demonstrated.
Adequate fluid resuscitation is fundamental in critical
care [16, 17], and entails aggressive large-volume fluid in-
take. However, several studies have reported that positive
FB was strongly associated with worse outcomes [18],
such as respiratory dysfunction [3], high intra-abdominal
pressure [19], coagulation disorder [20], and increased
mortality [21]. Excessive fluid accumulation may impair
clinical outcomes. Several studies have demonstrated that
strategies aimed at avoiding an excessive positive FB such
as restricted fluid resuscitation may be beneficial. One sys-
tematic review found that restricted fluid resuscitation
was
associated
with
decreased
mortality
in
trauma
patients compared with initial liberal fluid resuscitation
[22]. Silversides et al. also reported that in patients
with acute respiratory distress syndrome or sepsis a
conservative fluid strategy resulted in a shorter dur-
ation of ventilator use and ICU stay [23]. Thus, the
use of strategies aimed at alleviating fluid overload
following initial fluid resuscitation has become very
important in ensuring better prognosis, suggesting the
potential role of diuretic use. However, in contrast to
the established knowledge on fluid accumulation, con-
clusions on the effectiveness and safety of loop di-
uretics in critically ill patients remain controversial.
In a pharmacoepidemiologic evaluation [24], furosemide
was listed as a nephrotoxic drug. Mehta et al. investigated
data from 552 AKI patients and reported that diuretic use
was significantly associated with higher mortality and

 worse renal function [25]. In critically ill patients requiring
acute dialysis post-surgery, a higher accumulative diuretic
dose was significantly associated with increased mortality
[26]. However, another multicenter, observational study
reported that diuretics were commonly prescribed in 1743
patients with acute renal failure, and that their use was
not associated with deteriorated outcomes, including mor-
tality [27]. A small pilot RCT also failed to confirm any
specific incremental risk with furosemide use in AKI pa-
tients, but suggested an insignificant downward trend in
the 90-day mortality (21.6% vs. 30.5%) [7].
On reviewing all the aforementioned studies, we spec-
ulated that the risk of death or other poor outcomes was
confounded by AKI severity (baseline sCr levels of
3.8 mg/dl [25], 3.3 mg/dl [26], 2.0 mg/dl [27], and
1.8 mg/dl [7]). Diuretic use in patients with severe AKI
may contribute to unfavorable outcomes. Grams et al.
concluded that post-AKI diuretic therapy was associated
with improved 60-day survival in patients with relatively
mild AKI (baseline sCr level 1.6 mg/dl) [8]. In our study,
the mean baseline sCr level was 1.39 mg/dl and diuretic
use was also associated with lower hospital mortality.
Additionally, we speculated that the association between
diuretic use and mortality might be mediated by fluid
status. In the current study, the UO volumes in the two
groups were similar and both reached the specific
therapeutic end goals (UO > 1 ml/kg/h [28]) after ad-
equate resuscitation. Meanwhile, the fluid intake vol-
ume was significantly higher in the no diuretic use
group, which directly lead to a higher positive FB. In
clinical practice, high fluid intake is one common
strategy to reach resuscitation goals, including UO
volume. However, due to the retrospective nature of
the study, we could not infer if the UO volume im-
pacted
the
fluid
administration
protocol
decision.
After adjustment for fluid intake using PSM, the FB
was still significantly lower in the diuretic use group
and largely depended on the increased UO; this was
more significant in the sensitivity analysis. To a cer-
tain extent, this speculation also explained why this
association
was
insignificant

even
opposite

 patients with severe AKI, as they may fail to respond
to the diuretic challenge.
Furthermore, an interaction between FB and diuretic
use was detected, and the benefit associated with diur-
etic use existed only in the positive FB subgroup; it
remained insignificant in the negative FB subgroup. This
finding further supports our speculation that in patients
with a positive FB, the use of diuretics may alleviate fluid
accumulation and thus contribute to improved survival.
However, compared with achieving a mildly negative FB,
achieving a greater degree of negative FB could not fur-
ther reduce mortality in critically ill patients [29]. Thus,
the use of loop diuretics may further increase the nega-
tive FB volume; however, this was not conducive to sur-
vival in the negative FB subgroup.
One major concern is that diuretic use may induce
hypovolemia and compromise the already impaired
hemodynamic status in such patients. In the current
study, we found a significant difference in the MAP be-
tween the two groups, which could be affected by less
fluid accumulation in the diuretic group. However, the
clinical difference was relatively small both in the crude
comparison and in the comparison after PSM (2–
3 mmHg). This finding is consistent with the conclusion
of Yeh et al. that furosemide in critically ill trauma
patients resulted in lower fluid accumulation, with no
detrimental effect on the hemodynamic parameters [30].
This finding was also supported by the results of a study
by Shann [31]. Furthermore, we noticed that the associ-
ation between diuretic use and hospital mortality was
still significant in the subgroups with high SOFA scores,
high maximum lactate levels, and low MAP, which
suggested the feasibility of the appropriate use of loop
diuretics in these patients.
This study has several limitations. First, there are many
confounders for diuretic use in clinical practice, such as the
reason for ICU admission, disease severity, kidney function,
hemodynamic status, vasopressors, and clinician preference.
In the current study, we included as many confounders as
possible to minimize potential bias. However, due to the
retrospective nature, some information was unavailable in
this database. Rigorously designed randomized controlled
studies may be the only solution for the imbalance between
these two groups. Second, we inferred that the use of loop
diuretics might reduce the mortality in this specific cohort.
However, in addition to their diuretic effect, the adverse ef-
fects of loop diuretics, such as renal oxidative stress [5], may
be overridden by the benefit of reduced positive FB. Caution
should be exercised in interpreting these findings, especially
in patients without fluid accumulation or those with severe

 AKI. Third, despite the benefit of vasopressors revealed in
the current study, the inter-heterogeneity of included pa-
tients was still a concern. For instance, is the effect of di-
uretics
consistent
in
patients
with
slight
or
massive
vasopressor support? More studies are needed to verify this
interaction. Fifth, missing data is an important issue in the
analysis. In the current study, the percentage of missing
values of most variables is relatively small. Thus, these miss-
ing values were replaced by their mean or median values in-
stead of using multiple imputation methods. Finally, the
causal relationship between diuretic use and mortality could
not be confirmed. While the use of a propensity score can
further support our speculation, it still cannot overcome the
primary limitation associated with the observational nature
of the study. Further prospective studies are needed to verify
our hypothesis.
Conclusions
Diuretic use was associated with reduced hospital mor-
tality in critically ill patients with vasopressor support,
without an obvious compromise in the MAP. This asso-
ciation was not affected by disease severity and serum
lactate levels; however, this was only significant in pa-
tients with a positive FB. Future larger randomized clin-
ical trials are required to confirm and validate this
association.
