Centrosomes are the major microtubule organising centres of animal cells. Deregulation in
their number occurs in cancer and was shown to trigger tumorigenesis in mice. However, the
incidence, consequence and origins of this abnormality are poorly understood. Here, we
screened the NCI-60 panel of human cancer cell lines to systematically analyse centriole
number and structure. Our screen shows that centriole amplification is widespread in cancer
cell lines and highly prevalent in aggressive breast carcinomas. Moreover, we identify another
recurrent feature of cancer cells: centriole size deregulation. Further experiments demon-
strate that severe centriole over-elongation can promote amplification through both centriole
fragmentation and ectopic procentriole formation. Furthermore, we show that overly long
centrioles form over-active centrosomes that nucleate more microtubules, a known cause of
invasiveness, and perturb chromosome segregation. Our screen establishes centriole
amplification and size deregulation as recurrent features of cancer cells and identifies novel
causes and consequences of those abnormalities.

entrosomes are the major microtubule organising centres
(MTOCs) of animal cells participating in signalling, cell
division, polarity and migration1–3. Each centrosome
comprises two centrioles surrounded by a proteinaceous matrix,
the pericentriolar material (PCM), which confers the microtubule
(MT) nucleation capacity4. Centrioles are microtubule-based
cylinders and their structure, length (≈450 nm) and number (4 in
mitosis) are tightly controlled in non-transformed cycling cells,
the latter being deregulated in cancer5. Centrioles duplicate in S
phase, with the formation of a new centriole next to each pre-
existing one, that subsequently elongates until mitosis6–8. The two
newly formed centrosomes migrate to opposite poles during
mitosis, contributing to bipolar spindle formation and appro-
priate chromosome segregation.
Centrosomes were identified more than one century ago by
Van Beneden9 and Boveri10 who first proposed a key role for
centrosome amplification (>2 centrosomes per cell) in promoting
aneuploidy and tumorigenesis11. Accordingly, abnormalities in
centrosome structure and number have been detected in various
tumours
since
the
nineties
and
associated
with
genomic
instability and poor prognosis5,12–15. However, these small
structures remained understudied until the advent of sensitive
proteomics and RNAi screens, which identified their components.
Manipulation of their expression uncovered novel functions for
centrosome amplification in promoting features of tumorigenesis,
namely chromosomal instability and invasiveness16,17. Moreover,
centrosome amplification was recently shown to trigger tumor-
igenesis in vivo18. Finally, while non-transformed cells normally
die or stop proliferating after abnormal mitosis due to centro-
some amplification, cancer cells use mechanisms to cope with this
abnormality19. With these findings, centrosome amplification and
associated survival mechanisms became appealing targets in
cancer therapy. Presently, drugs that either prevent centrosome
duplication (i.e. a PLK4 inhibitor20) or target centrosome
amplification survival mechanisms (i.e. HSET inhibitors21,22) are
in clinical trials or under development, respectively.
However, the identification of centrosome amplification origins
and frequency among and within different tumours is critical for
its clinical exploitation. Until now, cell division failure and
deregulation of the centrosome duplication machinery are the
two main mechanisms known to experimentally induce centro-
some amplification23. However, their relative contributions are
not known in cancer, mostly due to technical challenges of
studying
such
small
structures.

Fig. 1 Quantifying centriole number and length in cancer cells. a Screen overview. Step 1 and 2: primary and secondary immunofluorescence screenings of
centrioles in the NCI-60 cancer cell lines using centrin (green) and centrin/CP110 (red) as centriolar markers, respectively. For each screening, we visually
selected 50 mitotic cells per each of the cell lines and programmed the microscope to automatically acquire images as Z-stack using a ×100 objective. Cells
were also stained with DAPI (blue) and α-tubulin antibody (red-primary screening, magenta-secondary screening). Scale bar 5 µm, insets 1 µm. Since
centriole dimensions (250 nm width and 400 nm length) are close to the resolution limit of light microscopy, we selected some cell lines with extreme
phenotypes for validation and further investigation, using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scale bar 500 nm. Please note that all the pictures
presented are from a non-cancerous cell line, RPE-1, used as a negative control in this study. b Overview of the semi-automatised quantitation of centriole
alterations. Briefly, maximum intensity projections, obtained from all the stacks collected per field of view, were created (step 1) and mitotic cells were
automatically segmented from a background of interphasic cells using a spatial correlation coefficient based on both DAPI and α-tubulin signals, both of
which are brighter in mitotic cells (step 2). Subsequently, centrioles were individually segmented using the centrin staining of each mitotic cell (step 3). In
the secondary screening, centrioles were independently identified using both centrin and CP110 staining, and only the structures where these two different
markers co-localised were kept for further analysis. Once identified in the 2D projections, all centrioles were segmented in three-dimensions (3D),
automatically split into individual centrioles and measured in 3D (steps 4, 5 and 6). The number of centrioles per mitotic cell and their individual lengths
were stored, together with a gallery of annotated images (see outputs of steps 2 and 3 for examples). These galleries were verified and manually curated
twice (at steps 3 and 5). All remaining steps, from 1 to 6, were automatically performed by the developed algorithm. Scale bar 5 µm, insets 0.5 µm

 performed in this area is hindered by: (i) the heterogeneity of
methods to study centrosomes, precluding comparisons between
studies, (ii) the quantification of centrosome alterations is biased
by the limited thickness of paraffin-embedded tissue samples12.
In view of these limitations, a systematic survey of centriole
abnormalities is imperative.
To assess the frequencies of centrosome abnormalities at the
single cell level amongst different cancer types, we chose the NCI-
60 panel of human cancer cell lines, derived from nine distinct
tissues, as a repository of cancer diversity24,25. Importantly, sev-
eral parameters, critical for a cohesive understanding of the origin
and consequences of centrosome abnormalities in cancer, have
been characterised in this panel, including: p53, ploidy status and
RNA expression25–30. Here, we develop a pipeline to semi-
automatically measure centriole number and length in mitotic
cells. We find that, in addition to centriole amplification, dereg-
ulation of centriole length is a recurrent feature of cancer, pro-
moting centriole amplification via both centriole fragmentation

 and ectopic procentriole formation. Centriole over-elongation
also induces the formation of enlarged centrosomes, with
increased MT nucleation capacities, enhancing chromosome
missegregation.
Altogether,
our
work
establishes
centriole
amplification and over-elongation as important features of cancer
biology, the latter enhancing MT nucleation and chromosomal
instability (CIN), two known tumorigenic features. Moreover, our
extensive overview of centriole defects in the NCI-60 panel,
combined with the publicly available information on its gene
expression and drug resistance, will allow further insights on
centriole regulation and the development of clinical applications
based on centriole aberrations.
Results
A semi-automated survey of centriole abnormalities. To assess
the frequencies of centrosome defects in different cancers, we
designed a semi-automated and systematic survey to quantify
both centriole number and length in the NCI-60 panel of cancer
cell lines (Fig. 1a). Given their small size, we developed an
algorithm to quantify and measure centrioles in 3D (Fig. 1b and
Methods). As both centriole number and length vary throughout
the cell cycle, we analysed only mitotic cells, which have a fixed
number (4) of fully elongated centrioles.
We performed a primary screening to rapidly estimate the
penetrance of centriole amplification and over-elongation. We
used centrin to count and measure centrioles as it localises early
to the distal end of centrioles, maximising their detection.
Furthermore, centrin has been successfully used (i) in centriole-
related screens31, (ii) to track centrioles by live imaging32, (iii) to
score centrosomal defects in cancer12 and (iv) as a readout for
centriole size33. Our results show that, while non-transformed
cells (human retinal pigmented cells, RPE-1) display no centriole
amplification, cancer cell lines have variable degrees of this
abnormality (from 5.6 to 90.7% of cells with >4 centrioles,
Supplementary Table 2). A total of 14 cell lines exhibit less than
15% of cells with amplification, 17 display between 15 and 30%
and 29 have more than 30% of amplification. Centriole size is also
controlled and rather homogeneous in non-transformed cells
(ref.34, RPE-1 show no over-elongation), but surprisingly variable
in the NCI-60 panel (from 0 to 51.7% of cells with overly long
centrioles, i.e. longer than 500 nm-twice the length of a normal-
length centriole measured using centrin staining, Supplementary
Table 2). A total of 49 cell lines exhibit less than 15% of cells with
over-elongation, 7 display between 15 and 30% and 4 have more
than 30% of over-elongation.
Although centrin is a widely used marker of all centrioles, false
positives may arise as centrin can be present in centriolar
satellites, small electron-dense granules35,36, justifying the need of
a validation screening. For this, we selected the top 50% of cell
lines of amplification and over-elongation (35 cell lines) and a
subset (18) of the less-defective ones to investigate the presence of
false negatives (Supplementary Table 2). We used centrin in
combination with a second centriolar marker, CP110, to reliably
label centrioles (Supplementary Fig. 1a) and only accounted
structures positive for both markers. With this strategy, we
identified cells with and without centriole amplification or over-
elongation (Figs 2a and 3a). Finally, to define the cut-off and
estimate the variability of centriole amplification and over-
elongation in non-cancerous cells, we quantified centriole
number and length in 5 non-cancerous cell lines from different
tissues: RPE-1, HB2, HaCat, LT97 and SAEC (Figs 2b and 3b).
On average, 7% ± 3 and 1% ± 2 of cells display centriole
amplification and over-elongation, respectively, in these cell lines.
Therefore, we set the cut-off for centriole amplification and over-
elongation to 13% and 5%, respectively (average + 2 s.d.). The
outputs of the secondary screening are depicted in Figs 2b and 3b.
Several cell lines included in the top 50% of amplification or over-
elongation in the primary screening did not significantly display
these anomalies in the secondary screening (Supplementary
Table 2). This inconsistency might be due to: (i) lack of sample
and/or counts reproducibility, (ii) centrin labelling satellites
besides centrioles or (iii) the presence of CP110-negative
centrioles. To address this, we compared the automated centrin
counts between both screenings in four cell lines displaying high
discrepancies between screenings and observed their similarity
(Supplementary Fig. 1b). CP110-negative and centrin-positive
structures are negative for other centriolar/centrosomal markers
in SN12C cell line, which displays the highest discrepancy
between screenings (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 1a). Finally,
while validating our screening by TEM (Fig. 3c, d), we observed
cells displaying supernumerary centrioles in MDA-MB-435 cell
line (positive control for amplification) but never in SN12C
(Fig. 2c). These data suggest that centrin labels other structures
than centrioles in SN12C cell line, and likely in the other cell lines
displaying high discrepancies between the two screenings.
Altogether, our observations demonstrate that centrin-positive
structures, which are negative for a second centriolar/centrosomal
marker, are unlikely bona fide centrioles, validating the results of
the secondary screening.
Centriole number and size are often increased in cancer. Our
secondary screening confirms that non-transformed cells display
low levels of centriole amplification (≈7%; Fig. 2b). Our data also
shows that approximately half of the cancer cell lines (28) display
more than 13% of amplification, threshold established based on
our controls, suggesting this abnormality is widespread. The

in which cell lines were ranked according to their percentage of mitotic cells with more than four centrioles. To define the cut-off for centriole amplification
and the variability of centriole number in non-cancerous cell lines, we quantified centriole number in five non-cancerous cell lines (depicted in green): RPE-1
(retinal pigmented epithelial cells), HB2 (mammary luminal epithelial cells), HaCat (keratinocytes), LT97 (colon adenoma cells) and SAEC (small airway
epithelial cells). The average percentage of cells with centriole amplification in the non-cancerous cell lines is 7 ± 3%, therefore we set the cut-off for
centriole amplification to 13% (average + 2 standard deviations). 28 cell lines from the NCI-60 panel displayed significant centriole amplification. Note that
for most of the cell lines, the majority of cells with amplification showed 5 to 8 centrioles per cell (grey). Cells with more than eight centrioles per cell (red)
were less commonly observed. A total of 50 to 60 mitotic cells were analysed per cell line. BR breast, CNS central nervous system, CO colon, BL blood, LU

 remaining cell lines display lower levels of centriole amplification,
similarly to non-cancerous cells (Fig. 2b). Centriole amplification
is always present in at least one but never in all cell lines origi-

specific rather than tissue-specific (Supplementary Table 2 and

 Our results suggest that increase and variability in centriole
length are novel recurrent features in cancer. Given the presence
of several long centrin-positive structures in some cancer cell
lines, we wondered whether these threads could represent
abnormal centrin-positive cilia rather than bona fide centrioles.
Nearly all centrin-positive structures are negative for ARL13B (a
cilia marker37) and positive for acetylated tubulin (a stable MTs
marker), therefore confirming the centriole nature of centrin
threads (Supplementary Fig. 4). For a final validation, centriole
length was measured by TEM in 4 cell lines: the non-cancerous
RPE-1 cells, and three cancer cell lines displaying increased levels
of centriole over-elongation: SN12C, HOP-62 and MDA-MB-435
(Fig. 3b). While centriole length did not exceed 500 nm in RPE-1
cells, we observed slightly longer centrioles in SN12C, long and
very long ones in HOP-62 and MDA-MB-435, respectively
(Fig. 3c, d). As expected, centrioles appear longer by TEM (e.g.
mean of 421 nm in RPE-1) than by immunofluorescence (IF,
mean of 277 nm) since centrin is restricted to the medium-distal
part of centrioles. Nevertheless, the TEM results mimic the IF
data as both show a significant increase in centriole length in the
3 cancer cell lines compared to the control, with SN12C and
MDA-MB-435, the least and the most deregulated ones. Our
TEM data further corroborates the IF results as centriole length
appears homogeneous in RPE-1 (VMR = 2) and SN12C (VMR =
4.5) cells but very heterogeneous in the two cell lines displaying
very long centrioles, HOP-62 (VMR = 51.9) and MDA-MB-435
(VMR = 280.3; Fig. 3d). Altogether, the TEM data validates our
IF survey of centriole length which established increase and
variability in centriole length as novel and recurrent features of
cancer cells.
The variability in centriole length was often higher in cell lines
with overly long centrioles, (Fig. 3b). This can both reflect inter-
cellular (only a subpopulation of cells is affected by centriole
over-elongation) and/or intra-cellular variabilities (only one
centriole in each cell is affected). To address this, we analysed
the distribution of the number of overly long centrioles per cell in
the NCI-60 secondary screening. Cells displaying centriole over-
elongation have mostly only one (87%), sometimes two (11%)
and rarely more than two (2%) elongated centrioles, feature
further validated in MDA-MB-435 cells (Supplementary Fig. 5a,
b). This intra-cellular heterogeneity might reflect that only certain
centrioles are permissive to centriole over-elongation. Each
cycling cell in mitosis has three generations of centrioles: the
grandmother (the eldest), the mother, generated in the previous
cycle, and finally, the daughters, born in the present cycle38. We
investigated if all generations of centrioles were equally affected
by centriole over-elongation using a marker of all centrioles
(acetylated tubulin) and a daughter-specific marker (STIL). In
MDA-MB-435 cell line, centriole over-elongation rather affects
mother/grandmother (98%) than daughter centrioles (Supple-
mentary Fig. 5c, d). Further staining, using the appendages
(structure of grandmother centrioles) protein CEP164, suggests
that centriole over-elongation likely affects mainly grandmother
centrioles in MDA-MB-435 cell line (Supplementary Fig. 5e).

tion (MDA-MB-231 (15%), MDA-MB-468 (24%), BT549 (25%)
and HS578T (33%)) while luminal cancer cell lines do not (MCF7
(5%) and T47D (9%); Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Sup-
plementary Table 2).
In addition, centriole amplification is associated with the most
common subset of colon carcinoma, CIN (chromosome instabil-
ity, microsatellites stable), as it was detected in some of these cell
lines (HCC-2998 and COLO205), but absent in all MSI-H cell
lines (microsatellites instability, hyper-mutated), HCT-15, HCT-
116 and KM12 (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary
Table 2). Our results suggest that centriole amplification is more
prevalent in specific subtypes of breast and colon cancer, which
are both associated with chromosome instability and worse
prognosis42,43.
We validated these findings in human breast using 15 hormone
receptor positive (luminal) and 10 hormone receptor negative
(basal-like) carcinomas (Fig. 4). Similar to cultured cells, we
observed a higher percentage of cells with supernumerary
centrioles in basal-like breast carcinomas (22%) than in luminal
ones (8%; Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary
Table 2). Our patient data supports the results of our systematic
survey
demonstrating that
centriole amplification is
more
frequent in basal-like than in luminal human breast carcinomas
suggesting that centriole amplification specifically occurs in more
aggressive molecular breast tumour subtypes.
Centriole amplification, p53 loss and ploidy deregulation. The
strongest molecular association shown with centrosome amplifi-
cation is loss of p53 function5,44,45. To test this, we used the
publicly available p53 status of the NCI-60 panel (Supplementary
Table 229). p53 is mutated in 80% of the cell lines and most of the
cell lines displaying centriole amplification exhibit impairment of
p53 function (24/28 cell lines). Nevertheless, this proportion is
not statistically different from the one observed in cell lines

elongation, and a subset of the less-defective ones, were processed in the secondary screening. The results of the secondary screening are depicted in the
bar graph (cell lines are ranked according to their percentage of mitotic cells containing at least one overly long centriole). The mean centriole length (blue)
and the variance-to-mean ratio (VMR-red), a normalised measure of the dispersion of the distribution, are depicted for each cell line. The cut-off for
centriole over-elongation (in green) was set to 5% which corresponds to the average percentage (1%) of cells with centriole over-elongation in the 5 non-
cancerous cell lines plus 2 s.d. (2%). 22 cell lines display significant centriole over-elongation. Centriole length was scored in 3D using centrin staining.

 without significant amplification (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Inter-
estingly, almost half of the p53 MT cell lines show no increase in
centriole number (18/42, Supplementary Table 2), suggesting that
loss of p53 is not sufficient to cause centriole amplification.
Centriole amplification may arise from cytokinesis failure,
mitotic slippage and/or cell fusion23, all of which would also lead
to severe ploidy deregulation. Mild ploidy deregulation might also
arise from centrosome amplification as the latter induces the
formation of lagging chromosomes17,46. We wondered whether
centrosome amplification correlates with ploidy deregulation,
modal chromosome number, numerical chromosome changes
and number of structural chromosomal rearrangement30,47
(Supplementary Table 2). All these parameters define the
karyotypic complexity and heterogeneity of each of the NCI-60
cell
line
and
none of
them
is
correlated
with
centriole
amplification (Supplementary Fig. 7b, c). However, 64% of the
cell lines with centrosome amplification show ploidy deregula-
tion, suggesting that events affecting both ploidy and centrosome
number, such as cytokinesis failure, might induce centriole
amplification in some cancers (Supplementary Table 2).
Centriole over-elongation drives centriole amplification. As
both centriole amplification and over-elongation are widespread
in our screen, we investigated their interdependency and observed
their correlation (Supplementary Fig. 8). Additionally, the pro-
portion of long centrioles in cells with centriole amplification is
statistically different from the expected proportion under the null
hypothesis of independence, therefore supporting that centriole
over-elongation and amplification are not independent (Fig. 5a).
This correlation might reflect that centriole over-elongation
triggers amplification, as suggested upon experimentally induced
centriole
over-elongation
in
the
osteosarcoma
cell
line,
U2OS48,49. To further substantiate this direct link in the NCI-60
panel,
we
overexpressed
CPAP,
a
promoter
of
centriole
elongation48, in two cancer cell lines without significant ampli-
fication and over-elongation, T47D and SF268. The percentage of
mitotic cells with amplification is significantly increased upon
CPAP overexpression (from 4% ± 1 to 26% ± 7 for T47D and
from 3% ± 1 to 28% ± 7 for SF268; Fig. 5b) therefore confirming
that over-elongation triggers amplification.
Centriole over-elongation might induce amplification via
ectopic procentriole formation48,49. Moreover, it was suggested
that overly long centrioles, may fragment48, which we tested by
inducing centriole over-elongation using CPAP overexpression in
U2OS cells (Supplementary Fig. 9). While maximum centriole
length is achieved at the onset of overexpression, a decrease in
length together with an increase in centriole number are then
observed (Supplementary Fig. 9a, c). This negative correlation
supports that centriole over-elongation induces amplification,
perhaps through fragmentation. To confirm this, we prevented
centriole biogenesis by inhibiting its master regulator, PLK4, with
centrinone B50, which drastically diminishes centriole number
(Supplementary Fig. 9d). Remarkably, CPAP overexpression
partially rescues centrinone B treatment with some cells even
displaying supernumerary centrioles (Supplementary Fig. 9d).
Centrosome
amplification
via
over-elongation
is
therefore
partially independent of centriole biogenesis, but relies partly
on fragmentation (Supplementary Fig. 9d), which was further
corroborated at the ultra-structural level by TEM (Supplementary
Fig. 9e).
We then investigated if centriole fragmentation and ectopic
centriole formation occur in the NCI-60 panel using two cell lines
displaying high degree of centriole over-elongation, MDA-MB-
435 and HOP-62. We examined centriole structure using TEM
and Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM), the latter using
acetylated tubulin as a centriole barrel marker. With SIM, we also
investigated procentriole nucleation sites using STIL staining.
While only normal-length centrioles with a proper barrel shaped
structure are visible in non-cancerous cells line (Fig. 5c, upper

note that only structures positive for both pericentrin and GT335 were taken into consideration to avoid false positives. All basal-like carcinomas (10 out of
10 patients) exhibited centriole amplification while it was not detected in 5 out of the 15 luminal carcinomas. Between 20 and 133 cells were analysed for

 panel), we observed asymmetrically elongated centrioles in MDA-
MB-435 cells, (Fig. 5c, middle panel), which often contain breaks
(see Fig. 5c, middle panel, lower TEM picture). This result
suggests either that only some of the MTs from the barrel have
been extended or that overly long centrioles are poorly stable and
break. Branched and opened centrioles at the tips were also
visualised by SIM in MDA-MB-435 and HOP-62 cells (Supple-
mentary Fig. S10a, b, panel (ii)). These data show that overly long
centrioles often exhibit abnormal, and likely unstable, structures
at their distal ends. Interestingly, we found evidences of centriole
fragmentation by SIM in MDA-MB-435 (fragment which were
neither procentrioles (STIL-negative) nor mother centrioles (not
associated to a nascent procentriole, unlike other centrioles in the
same cell; Fig. 5c, lower panel, insets 2). Centriole fragmentation
was also observed in HOP-62 cells (fragments emanating from
long centrioles; Supplementary Fig. 10b, panel (iii)). This was
further confirmed by TEM in MDA-MB-435 cells with the
presence of centriole fragments surrounding a centriole with a
markedly abnormal tip, (Fig. 5c, dotted boxes of Ai, Aii and Aiii).
Induced centriole over-elongation triggers amplification via
ectopic procentrioles formation48,49. Normally, only one procen-
triole forms close to each mother centriole proximal-end in
control cells (STIL-positive centriole, Fig. 5c, upper panel).
Strikingly, we observed that 4% of the overly long centrioles of
MDA-MB-435 cells nucleate multiple procentrioles along their
length (asterisk in inset 3 of SIM picture of Fig. 5c and

 Supplementary Fig. 10c), a phenomenon further confirmed by
TEM (asterisk in the EM pictures Biii and Biv of Fig. 5c). Our
study discovered two novel sources of centriole amplification in
some cancer cells: centriole fragmentation and ectopic procen-
triole formation upon severe centriole over-elongation.
Overly long centrioles form over-active centrosomes. Our sur-
vey unravelled centriole length deregulation as a novel common
feature of cancer cells. Interestingly centriole length was suggested
to set centrosome size48,51, therefore overly long centrioles should
form larger, and over-active, MTOCs. To test this, we first
determined if overly long centrioles recruit more PCM than
normal-length centrioles. To investigate specifically the effect of
“centriole length” on PCM recruitment, we quantified the PCM
content (γ-tubulin and pericentrin) of centrosomes with an
asymmetric centriole length content in MDA-MB-435 mitotic
cells and in mitoses with only normal-length centrioles (thereafter
called symmetric mitoses) in RPE-1 and MDA-MB-435 cells
(Methods section). Mitoses containing overly long centrioles
clearly display an asymmetry in PCM content with poles with
longer centriole(s) recruiting more than double PCM amount
than the other poles. Contrarily, in symmetric mitoses, almost no
difference in PCM content was observed between poles (Fig. 6a
and Supplementary Fig. 11a). These results suggest that overly
long centrioles recruit more PCM than normal-length centrioles
which was further investigated by inferring the interdependency
of PCM content and centriole length (centrin intensity) in MDA-
MB-435 and HOP-62 cells. Both parameters indeed correlate in
both cell lines, confirming that elongated centrioles recruit more
PCM (Supplementary Fig. 11b, c).
To further substantiate the direct link between centriole over-
elongation and enhanced PCM recruitment, we induced centriole
over-elongation in T47D and SF268 and quantified PCM content
of normal-length and overly long centrioles (YFP and CPAP
overexpression, respectively). Elongated centrioles contain more
PCM than normal-length centrioles (Fig. 6b), therefore confirm-
ing that overly long centrioles form larger centrosomes which are
likely over-active. To confirm this, we analysed the MT regrowth
capacities of centrosomes in (i) MDA-MB-435 mitoses displaying
overly long centrioles, and (ii) RPE-1 and MDA-MB-435
symmetric mitoses (Methods section). Almost no difference in
α-tubulin content was observed between poles in symmetric
mitoses (Fig. 6c). Remarkably, in spindles with asymmetric poles,
the pole containing longer centriole(s) contains, ≈1,6 times more
MTs than the other pole (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Fig. 11d),
demonstrating that centrosomes containing overly long centrioles
are indeed over-active.
Elongated centrioles enhance chromosome segregation defects.
Induced centriole over-elongation was suggested to trigger
defective cell division, mostly through multipolar mitosis for-
mation due to the accumulation of supernumerary MTOCs48. We
reasoned that centriole over-elongation could intrinsically, and
independently of centriole amplification, be detrimental for
mitotic cells as overly long centrioles form over-active centro-
somes that might generate unbalanced forces on chromosomes,
leading to chromosome instability and aneuploidy, two known
features of cancer52. To test this, we compared the occurrence of
chromosome segregation defects in mitotic MDA-MB-435 cells
containing only two centrosomes, with or without asymmetric
centriolar content. The incidence of chromosome segregation
defects, especially DNA/chromosome bridges, was higher in
asymmetric anaphases and telophases (32%), compared to sym-
metric ones (18%; Fig. 6d and Supplementary Fig. 12a, b).
To further link centriole over-elongation to chromosome
segregation defects, we induced over-elongation in T47D and
SF268.
The
proportion
of
multipolar
prometaphases
and
metaphases, a known source of chromosome instability17,46,
statistically increases upon CPAP overexpression (from 14% ± 1
to 34% ± 8 in T47D and from 3% ± 0 to 18% ± 4 in SF268;
Fig. 6e). Chromosome missegregation during anaphases and
telophases is also significantly enhanced upon CPAP over-
expression (from 28% ± 0 to 44% ± 4 in T47D and from 17% ± 4
to 40% ± 4 in SF268, Fig. 6e and Supplementary Fig. 12c). Our
results show that induced centriole over-elongation enhances
multipolar mitosis formation and chromosome segregation
defects in cancer cell lines.
In conclusion, our results suggest that overly long centrioles
induce the formation of over-active centrosomes which enhance
chromosome missegregation, both directly and indirectly via
centrosome amplification. This likely leads to aneuploidy and
therefore may participate in tumorigenesis (Fig. 7).
Discussion
Recent work showed the importance of centriole amplification in
promoting tumorigenesis18 and as a target for cancer therapy20,21,
raising the need to determine its prevalence and origins in cancer.
Here, we provided a sensitive and robust systematic survey of
centriole abnormalities in cancer cells. Our survey established
that centriole over-elongation and amplification are widespread
in cancer, the latter correlating with aggressiveness in breast and
colon cancer cell lines. Our follow up studies showed that overly
long centrioles form over-active centrosomes that enhance
chromosome missegregation. Furthermore, we provide the first
explanation for the occurrence of centrosome amplification in
cancer as we demonstrate that centriole over-elongation generates
Fig. 5 Centriole over-elongation drives centriole amplification in cancer cells via ectopic procentriole formation and centriole fragmentation. a Centriole
elongation and amplification are not independent. Higher proportion of overly long centrioles (>500 nm) in cells with centriole amplification (CA), (p <
0.0001, Pearson’s Chi-squared test), compared with the expected proportions under the null hypothesis of independence. The expected and observed
percentages of overly long centrioles in cells with no CA and CA are shown, together with a detailed view above, given the low frequency of overly long
centrioles. b Induced centriole elongation triggers centriole amplification in cancer cell lines. CPAP was transiently overexpressed for 96 h in two cell lines
from the NCI-60 panel, T47D and SF268, which do not normally display centriole over-elongation. Cells were stained with DAPI (blue), alpha-tubulin
(a marker of MTs) and centrin (used as a readout for centriole number) antibodies (Scale bar 5 µm). 3 independent experiments performed (depicted with
squares, triangles and circles). 80–140 cells were counted per condition and per experiment. The bars represent the means ± s.d. *Represents a p < 0.05

ectopic procentriole nucleation. Our work represents an impor-
tant asset to uncover the origins and consequences of centrosome
defects in cancer, and in the development of new tools for cancer
diagnosis and therapeutics.
The NCI-60 panel encompasses 60 cancer cell lines from nine
distinct tissues, and has been widely used as a repository of cancer
diversity, since the majority of the NCI-60 cell lines genetically
represent their corresponding tumour types24. Our survey rein-
forces the use of this panel as we observed a strong correlation

 between the findings in breast cancer cell lines and patient
samples.
Our survey demonstrated that half of the NCI-60 cell lines, and
all analysed tissues, show significant centriole amplification
compared to non-cancerous cell lines, confirming how wide-
spread this phenomenon is in cancer. We also identified increase
and variability in centriole length as common features of cancer
cells, explaining previous observations of overly large and/or long
centrin-positive structures in both breast cancer and plasma cell
neoplasms in situ53,54.
Our survey unveiled discrepancies in the penetrance of cen-
triole amplification within different cell lines from the same tis-
sue, indicating that centriole amplification is tumour-specific
rather than tissue-specific. We showed that centriole amplifica-
tion is more prevalent in specific molecular subtypes of breast
(basal-like) and colon (CIN molecular subtype) cancer cell lines
which represent particularly aggressive carcinomas, associated
with
poor
prognosis42,43.
Specific
molecular
features
pre-
ferentially present in these carcinomas may underlie the presence
of high levels of centrosome amplification. For instance, basal-like
breast carcinomas have an increased incidence in patients with
germline BRCA1 mutations55, shown to induce centrosome
overduplication56. In CIN colon cancer, centrosome amplification
may arise through Aurora-A gene amplification, whose over-
expression leads to supernumerary centrosomes45,57,58. Our data
confirm that centrosome amplification is associated with malig-
nant features, endorsing its potential as a tumour classifier to
establish prognosis and predict treatment response. The fact that
centrosome alterations are quite penetrant in cancer and rare in
non-cancerous cell lines, supports its use as a target in aggressive
tumour therapy20,23.
The large variability in the percentage of cells with super-
numerary centrioles observed between cell lines confirms the
concept of an intrinsic centrosome amplification “set point” for
each cell line, proposed by Wong et al.50. By reversibly inhibiting
centriole biogenesis, these authors generated dividing cells with-
out centrosomes in different cancer cell lines. After inhibitor
washout, cells form massive amounts of centrosomes de novo, but
gradually recover their initial level of centrosome amplification50.
This may reflect a tumour-specific dynamic equilibrium between
stochastic emergence and death of cells with supernumerary
centrioles. Accordingly, a recent study followed cell fate after
induced centriole overduplication and highlighted that their off-
spring dies during the next cell cycle59. In conclusion, while cells
with multiple centrosomes may arise and be present in the
population, part of their progeny may die. Cells with centriole
amplification may survive only if beneficial to the overall popu-
lation (e.g. by promoting invasiveness16 and/or yet unknown
non-cell autonomous effects that promote survival). Further
understanding of the “centrosome set point” is critical to suc-
cessfully use centrosome amplification as a target for cancer
therapy.
Previously, both the limited use of centriole markers and
absence of genetic characterisation of tumours precluded proper
and
systematic
understanding
of
the
origin
of
centriole
abnormalities5,12. Our screening provided an opportunity to
address this important question. We focused initially in under-
standing the role of p53 and ploidy deregulation, given existing
controversy on their importance23,60,61. While most cell lines
with amplification lost p53 function, this event is not sufficient to
trigger this abnormality, therefore reinforcing the idea that loss of
p53 function is a prerequisite to sustain centrosome amplification
across cancer44,45,62, rather than a direct cause. Finally, we
observed that only a subpopulation of the cell lines displaying
amplification has significant increase in ploidy, suggesting dif-
ferent origins of ploidy and centrosome deregulations. Given that
cells were in a steady state, we cannot exclude that a common
event affects both ploidy and centrosome homoeostasis, as this
might be hidden by differential evolution of ploidy and centro-
some number. Further studies looking at the evolution of popu-

deregulation are needed to understand how these processes are
related in cancer.
Our study identified a novel cause of centriole amplification in
cancer, centriole over-elongation. This defect affects only a sub-
population of cells, therefore reflecting inter-cellular hetero-
geneity that can reflect a dynamic equilibrium between genesis
and death of cells with centriole over-elongation. In addition, we
observed intra-cellular heterogeneity with usually only one or two
overly long centrioles per mitotic cell. This might reflect that
centriole length regulators are rate-limiting or alternatively that
not all centrioles are equally permissive to centriole length
deregulation. We rather substantiated the latter hypothesis by
showing that centriole over-elongation mostly affects grand-
mother centrioles in MDA-MB-435 cell line. Additional studies
are now required to further investigate those hypotheses.
We showed that overly long centrioles can fragment and
ectopically form procentrioles in cancer cell lines. These phe-
nomena likely explain previous observations of long centrin fibres
and electron-dense fragment-like microtubule complexes in
breast carcinoma53. This phenotype could result from the

Fig. 6 Centriole over-elongation leads to the formation of over-active centrosomes. a, b Overly long centrioles recruit more pericentriolar material than
normal-length centrioles. a RPE-1 (control, only normal-length centrioles) and MDA-MB-435 (with normal-length and overly long centrioles) cells were
stained with DAPI (blue), centrin (green), and γ-tubulin or pericentrin, (PCM components, red) antibodies (for details see Supplementary Fig. 11a and
methods). 3 independent experiments performed (squares, triangles, circles). A total of 37–62 centrosomes quantified per condition and per experiment.
One-tailed unpaired t test with Welch’s correction. b Induced centriole elongation triggers enhanced PCM recruitment. CPAP was overexpressed for 48 h
in two NCI-60 cell lines, T47D and SF268, which do not display overly long centrioles. Cells were stained with DAPI (blue), pericentrin (red) and acetylated
tubulin (green) antibodies. Compilation of three experiments (around 30 centrosomes accounted per condition and per experiment). Mann–Whitney test.
c Overly long centrioles nucleate more MTs than normal-length centrioles. Microtubule regrowth assay in RPE-1 and MDA-MB-435 cell line. Cells were

performed (squares, triangles, circles). A total of 30–82 centrosomes accounted per condition and per experiment. One-tailed unpaired t test with Welch’s
correction. d Chromosome segregation defects (see Supplementary Fig. 12a, b) are increased in mitotic cells with overly long centrioles. MDA-MB-435
cells were stained with DAPI (blue), CENPB (centromere, green), centrin (green) and CP110 (red, CP110 antibody sometimes labels the midbody)
antibodies. (200 cells counted per experiment, n = 3 squares, triangles, circles). z score test. e, f Induced centriole elongation enhances multipolar mitosis

cell lines. Cells were stained with DAPI (blue), α-tubulin (red) and centrin (green) antibodies. Three independent experiments performed (squares,
triangles, circles). Between 30–87 mitosis for e and 38–55 for f accounted per condition and per experiment. z score test, one-tailed. For all images: scale

 regulators48,49,63, or loss of cell cycle control64. Further investi-
gations including mining the publicly available NCI-60 omics
data are now required to identify the causes of centriole length
deregulation in cell lines displaying over-elongation. This strategy
is critical to exploit this defect in cancer biology, and will likely
provide a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying
centriole length regulation in normal cells.
Supernumerary centrosomes induce aneuploidy, via merotelic
attachment of chromosomes during mitosis, as well as invasive-
ness, due to enhanced MT nucleation capacity resulting in
extracellular matrix degradation and RAC1 activation16,17. We
propose that overly long centrioles may induce these features via
the formation of supernumerary centrioles. In addition, overly
long centrioles might directly trigger invasiveness as they form
over-active centrosomes which enhance MTs nucleation and
chromosome missegregation. We indeed observed an increase in
the occurrence of chromosome misalignments, polar asymmetry
and lagging chromosomes upon centriole over-elongation. These
defects likely result from the formation of asymmetric mitoses
with the pole containing longer centrioles, being over-active,
capturing more chromosomes than the other pole. Similarly,
mitoses with uneven numbers of daughter centrioles between the
two poles were recently shown to display asymmetric PCM
content and, therefore MT nucleation capacities. This asymmetry
in MT content leads to unequal kinetochore capture therefore
increasing the rate of chromosome missegregation59. Surpris-
ingly, we also observed an increase in the occurrence of chro-
mosome bridges upon centriole elongation. Overly long centrioles
may induce this defect by triggering mitotic delays, therefore
inducing Aurora B kinase-dependent telomere uncapping and
chromosome fusion65. Alternatively, chromosome bridges might
be a consequence of the formation of lagging chromosomes. The
latter can generate micronuclei with fragmented chromosomes,
which
in
the
next
cell
cycle
cause
bridges66,67.
Further
investigations are now required to decipher how centriole elon-
gation triggers chromosome segregation defects. Altogether, our
work demonstrates that centriole over-elongation enhances
microtubule nucleation and chromosomal instability, two known
tumorigenic features. Further studies are now required to deter-
mine if centriole over-elongation is sufficient to trigger tumor-
igenesis in vivo.
Our study provides a thorough and comprehensive compen-
dium of centriole number and length abnormalities in the NCI-60
panel of cancer cell lines. Our work supports that centrosome
amplification is widespread in cancer and uncovers centriole
length deregulation as a common feature in cancer cells. Because
these changes are specific to cancer, these findings unravel novel
and promising opportunities in the fields of cancer diagnostic and
therapy. Our survey combined with the publicly available data of
the NCI-60 cell lines are powerful and invaluable tools for the
identification of the molecular mechanisms by which cancer cells
lose precise control of centriole number and length. By making
our data publicly available, we will substantially expand the
characterisation of the NCI-60 panel of cancer cell lines and
consequently its use by the scientific community in the pursuit of
novel clinical and diagnostic tools in cancer research.
Methods
Cell culture. All NCI-60 cell lines were cultured in their respective media (see
Supplementary Table 1), which was supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS,
Gibco), Penicillin (100 IU mL−1, Gibco) and Streptomycin (100 µg mL−1, Gibco).
Note that the origins of all the NCI-60 cell lines are stated in Supplementary
Table 1. NCI/ADR-RES, MDA-MB-435 and SNB-19 were reported to be mis-
identified cell lines. To keep the NCI-60 panel entire, and be able to compare with
other studies using this panel, we kept these cell lines but affiliated them to their
relative correct tissue of origin. All NCI-60 cells used in the secondary screening
were tested for mycoplasma, the remaining cell lines were not. None of the cell
lines used in this study were authenticated. hTERT-RPE-1 (kind gift from Lars

Fig. 7 Cellular consequences of centriole length deregulation. In cancer cells, over elongated centrioles induce centriole amplification through centriole
fragmentation and/or ectopic procentriole formation along the elongated centrioles. Elongated centrioles also generate larger MTOCs with a higher
capacity to nucleate MTs that enhance chromosome instability during mitosis. Both scenarios could give rise to aneuploidy and might as well induce
invasiveness, therefore centriole length deregulation might participate to tumour initiation and progression

 DMEM (Gibco) media with 10%FBS. For HB2 cell line, the media was supple-
mented with 5 µg mL−1 of hydrocortisone and 10 µg mL−1 of insulin. The LT97
(kind gift from Sérgia Velho—I3S) cell line was cultured in a 4/1 mixture of
HamF12 (Gibco, supplemented with 10 mM Hepes, Calbiochem) and L15 (Gibco)
media supplemented with 2% FBS, 10 µg mL−1 insulin, 2 × 10−10 M triiodotyronin
(Sigma), 2 µg mL−1 transferrin (Gibco), 1 µg mL−1 hydrocortisone and 30 ng mL−1
epidermal growth factor (Sigma). The SAEC (kind gift from Tyson Sharp—BCI-
QMUL) cell line was cultured in SAGMTM BulletKitTM media (Lonza). The U2OS
cell line (kind gift from Pierre Gönczy—EPFL) was cultured in Mc Coy’s media
(Gibco). All media were supplemented Penicillin (100 IU mL−1, Gibco) and
Streptomycin (100 µg mL−1, Gibco). L-Glutamine (2 mM, Gibco) was also added
to all glutamine-deprived media. All cell lines were grown in a humidified 5% CO2
incubator at 37 °C.
Human breast carcinoma samples. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded
human breast tumour samples were consecutively retrieved from the files of the
Department of Pathology, Hospital Xeral-Cies, Vigo, Spain. This series comprises
15 luminal carcinomas and 10 basal-like tumours. The status of the oestrogen
receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2), antigen Ki67, and the basal markers epidermal growth factor receptor,
cytokeratin 5, cytokeratin 14, P-cadherin and Vimentin was previously char-
acterised for all of tumour cases. According to their immunoprofile, breast tumour
samples were classified as luminal (ER+, PR+, HER2− and Ki67−) or basal-like
carcinomas (ER−, PR−, HER2−, basal marker+). Representative tumour areas
were carefully selected and at least two tissue cores (0.6 mm in diameter) were
deposited into a tissue microarray. This study was conducted under the national
regulative law for the handling of biological specimens from tumour banks, with
samples being exclusively used for research purposes in retrospective studies.
Informed consent was obtained from all human participants.
Immunofluorescence staining. Adherent cell lines were directly grown on glass
coverslips. Suspension cell lines were pelleted and then re-suspended in 100 µL of
1× Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution without Calcium and
Magnesium (Biowest) and cytospinned onto slides using a Wescor Inc 7620
Cytopro™ Cytocentrifuge (500 rpm for 5 min at medium acceleration). Subse-
quently, both adherent and suspension cells were fixed using cold methanol for 10
min at −20 °C and, afterwards, incubated with 1× PBS containing 10% FBS for 30
min at room temperature. Immediately after, cells were incubated for 1 h and 30
min at room temperature with primary antibodies diluted in 1× PBS + 10% FBS.
After the incubation with the primary antibody, cells were washed three times, 5
min each, using a 1× PBS solution. After the washes, the cells were incubated for 1
h at room temperature with secondary antibodies (Alexa 488 or Fitc, Rhodamine,
Alexa 647 or Cy5, Jackson), diluted at 1/500 in 1× PBS with 10% FBS. Immediately
after, coverslips were washed three times, 5 min each, in 1× PBS solution, where in
DAPI was added to the second wash to stain DNA. The coverslips obtained by this
procedure were mounted on slides using ProLong® Gold Antifade Reagent
(Molecular Probes®). The slides were kept 24 h at room temperature to allow the
mounting media to cure. For Human breast carcinomas, 3 µm-thick tissue sections
were deparaffinised in Clear-Rite-3 (Thermo Scientific, USA, CA) and rehydrated
using a series of solutions with decreasing concentrations of ethanol. High tem-
perature (98 °C, 60 min) antigenic retrieval with Tris-EDTA pH = 9.0 (LeicaBio-
systems, UK) was performed, followed by incubation with UltraVision protein
block (Thermo Scientific) for 30 min at room temperature. The slides were,
afterwards, incubated with mouse anti-GT335 (1/800 dilution, Adipogen Ref. AG-
20B-0020-C100) and rabbit anti-pericentrin (1/250 dilution, Abcam AB4448) in
UltraAb diluent (Thermo Scientific) overnight at 4 °C. The sections were then
washed three times, 5 min per wash, with 1× PBS + 0.02% Tween20 before a 1 h
room temperature incubation with the secondary antibodies, anti-IgG rabbit
coupled to Alexa 488 and anti-IgG mouse coupled to Alexa-594 (Invitrogen),
diluted at 1/500 in PBS. Finally, sections were washed extensively with 1× PBS +
0.02% Tween20 and then counterstained and mounted with Vectashield containing
DAPI (VectorLabs, CA, USA).
Imaging was performed on a Zeiss Imager Z1 inverted microscope, equipped
with an AxioCam MRm camera (Zeiss) and ApoTome (Zeiss), using the ×100 1.4
NA Oil immersion objective. Images were taken as Z-stacks in a range of 10–14
µm, with a distance between planes of 0.3 μm, and were deconvolved with
AxioVision 4.8.1 software (Zeiss). Only the structures positive for GT335
(centriolar marker) and pericentrin (PCM marker) were analysed and scored.
Countings of centrioles were performed in breast cancer cases, with a minimum of
20, and a maximum of 133 cells scored per case. Statistical analyses were conducted
using IBM SPSS Statistics (Version 22.0. Armonk, NY, IBM Corp). The statistical
significance of the associations between categorical variables was determined using
the χ2 test. A Mann–Whitney statistical test was used to compare centrioles scoring
between luminal and basal-like carcinomas. A two-tailed 5% significance level was
considered as statistically significant (p < 0.05).
Primary immunofluorescence screening. Cells were stained with DAPI, centrin-2
(1/100 dilution, Ref. sc-27793-R, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,) and alpha-tubulin (1/
100 dilution, Ref. DM1A, Sigma) antibodies. Images were acquired on an Applied
Precision DeltavisionCORE system, mounted on an Olympus IX71 inverted
microscope, using a ×100 1.4 NA Oil immersion Olympus UPlan SAPO objective.
Data were acquired with a Photometrics Cascade II EMCCD camera (final pixel
size: 0.128 μm) through Applied Precision SoftWorx v5.5.1 Resolve3D acquistion
software using DAPI (Ex: 390/18; Em: 457/50), FITC (Ex: 475/28; Em: 528/38),
TRITC (Ex: 542/28; Em: 617/73) and CY5 (EX: 632/22; Em: 685/40) bandpass
filters for DAPI, Ax488, Rhodamine and Ax647 fluorophores, respectively, with a
Lumencor Spectra 7 SSL light engine. Images were taken as Z-stacks in a range of
10–14 µm and were later deconvolved with Applied Precision’s SoftWorx decon-
volution software (Note that these acquisition settings were used for all experi-
ments depicted in the manuscript, unless otherwise stated). Quantification of
centriole number and length was performed in at least 50 mitotic cells, for each of
the cell lines tested, using our in-house developed algorithm (see description
below).
Secondary immunofluorescence screening. Cells were stained with DAPI,
centrin-1 (1/1000 dilution, clone 20H5, Millipore), CP110 (1/250 dilution, home-
made) and α-tubulin (1/100 dilution, YL1/2 MCA776, Serotec) antibodies (for
more details, Immunofluorescence staining section). Confocal image stacks were
acquired on a Yokogawa CSU-X1 Spinning Disk confocal scan head, coupled to a
Nikon Ti microscope, using a Nikon ×100 Apo TIRF 1.49 NA Oil immersion
objective with the ×1.5 auxiliary magnification. 405, 491, 561 and 642 nm wave-
length lasers were used to excite DAPI, Alexa 488, Rhodamine and Alexa 647,
respectively. Images were acquired with a Photometrics Evolve 512 EMCCD
camera through Metamorph acquisition software (Molecular Devices). Images
were taken as Z-stacks in a range of 10–14 µm, with a distance between planes of
0.2 μm.
Deconvolution in three spatial dimensions was performed with the Parallel
Iterative Deconvolution plugin of ImageJ, using the Wiener Filter Preconditioned
Landweber algorithm with the following parameters: weiner = 0.001 (expressed as
a fraction of the largest Fourier coefficent of the PSF), low = 1, maximum number
of iterations = 25, terminate = 0.01 (terminate if mean delta less than this value).
This methodology requires a normalised point spread function (PSF), which was
previously created with the Diffraction PSF 3D PlugIn of ImageJ with the
parameters: Index of refraction of the mounting median = 1.46 (ProLong® Gold
Antifade Reagent, Molecular Probes®); numerical aperture NA = 1.44, wavelength
= 461, 519, 590, 667 nm for DAPI, AlexaFluor-488, Rodamine Red-X, and
AlexaFluor-647, respectively; image pixel spacing = 86.7 nm, slice spacing (z) =
200 nm, width = 64 pixels, height = 64 pixels.
Quantification of centriole number and length was performed in at least 50
mitotic cells, for each of the cell lines tested, using our in-house developed
algorithm (see description below).
Semi-automated quantification of centriole number and length. Centrioles
located at the vicinity of mitotic spindles were identified with the following algo-
rithm encoded in C/C++ using OpenCV 2.4.3 libraries (source code available on
request to A.G.). The segmentation of the mitotic figures from interphasic cells was
performed using the following procedure: calculate the maximum intensity pro-
jections of the DAPI and alpha-tubulin (rhodamin) signals; MaxB and MaxR,
respectively (step 1.1). Smooth MaxB and MaxR with a Gaussian kernel, σ = 1.15
μm (step 1.2). Calculate the per-element product of MaxB and MaxR, which we
named as CM, the correlation matrix (step 1.3). This CM serves to determine the
regions containing mitotic figures, characterised by having both a bright DAPI (due
to DNA condensation) and a bright alpha-tubulin (spindle) staining. Segmentate
the brightest objects of CM by the Otsu’s method68 (step 1.4). Calculate the signal
to noise ratio (S/N) of CN, where S corresponds to the mean pixel intensity of the
object class and N corresponds to the mean value of the pixels of non-object class
(step 1.5). Keep the objects with a S/N higher than 2.5. Otherwise segmentate the
objects from the CM by an intensity criterion: Calculate the mean (CMmean) and
standard deviation (CMsd) of CM and classify each pixel of CM to be part of the
object class (if its value is higher than Cmean + 6 × Csd), or to be part of the
background class (if its value is less or equal or less than Cmean + 6 × Csd) (step 1.6).
Dilate the remaining objects with a circular kernel, with r = 2.2 μm (step 1.7).
Apply a circularity criterion (Circ) over the objects to discharge edgy objects. The
Circ coefficient, which we define as Circ = (Harea − Oarea)/Harea, is a non-
dimensional quantity that relates the area of a given object (Oarea) to the area of its
convex hull (Harea), calculated with the Sklansky’s algorithm (Sklansky, 1982), with
Harea ≤ Oarea. An edgy object will have Circ close to 1 and a circular object will have
a Circ close to 0. Keep object with a Circ < 0.2 (step 1.8). Eliminate small objects
(delete if Oarea < 400 μm2), (step 1.9). Dilate the remaining objects with a circular
kernel, with r = 2.2 μm, to include regions closer to the spindle (step 1.10). Each
remaining 2D contour object will contain a mitotic figure and any centriole located
within a vicinity of 2.2 μm (step 1.11).
The segmentation of centrioles located at the vicinity of mitotic figures was
performed using the following procedure: Calculate the maximum intensity
projection, MAXcentrin and MAXCP110, of each centrin and CP110 channel,
respectively (step 2.1). Note that, for the primary screening, we only used a single
centriolar marker, namely centrin. As a consequence, for the primary screening, we
used only MAXcentrin, while, for the secondary screening, both MAXcentrin and
MAXCP110 were used. Segmentate, from MAXcentrin, and MAXCP110, the regions

 surrounded by the contours found in step 1.11, which we call ROICellcentrin and
ROICellCP110 (step 2.2). For each ROICellcentrin and ROICellCP110 matrices,
perform a bicubic interpolation overall ROICell pixels, with a size factor of 8, to
create the ROI.8xyCell matrix (step 2.3). This interpolation step helps to better
define the contours of the centrioles, which will be segmentated in the following
steps. Segmentate the brightest objects of each ROI.8xyCell by the Otsu method.
Use the Mander’s overlap coefficient to identify colocalising objects between
ROI.8xyCellcentrin and ROI.8xyCellCP110 matrices (the co-localisation step was
omitted for the primary screening) (step 2.4). Each of the remaining objects, which
we stored on a given ROI.8xCenti matrix, will contain the maximum intensity
projections of the centrin channel, each corresponding to the 2D projection of a
putative centrosome. Delete any ROI.8xCenti object smaller than 0.1 μm2, and
bigger than 1 μm2 (step 2.5). Identify the corresponding ROI.8xCenti pixels in all z-
stacks of ROI.8xyCell (step 2.6). Interpolate the corresponding z-planes with a
bicubic interpolation, and segmentate the pixels associated to the putative
centrosomei in 3D from the resulting matrix using the same threshold value
calculated in step 2.4. Store the segmentated objects on the ROI.8x.3DCenti matrix.
Perform a principal component analysis over any object of ROI.8x.3DCenti to
calculate its eigenvectors (step 2.7). Create a maximum intensity projection over
the first eigenvector of each ROI.8x.3DCenti object and calculate its inflexion
points (with a Sobel operator, step 2.8). For each object of ROI.8x.3DCenti create a
maximum intensity projection over the plane created by its first and second
eigenvectors (step 2.9). For each ROI.8x.3DCenti object, use a perpendicular plane,
shaped by its second and third eigenvectors, to split it at the inflexion points found
in step 2.8 (step 2.10). Repeat iteratively steps 2.7 to 2.9 over each resulting object
until any single object of ROI.8x.3DCenti becomes totally segmentated (step 2.11).
The resulting objects obtained from steps 2.9 to 2.11 will be considered as single
centrioles (step 2.12). The 3D length of each resulting centriole is finally calculated
from its first eigenvalue.
In summary, steps 1.1 to 1. 11 allow to identify mitotic figures in a background
of interphasic cells; steps 2.1 to 2.6 allow to identify the centrosomes located in the
vicinity of a given mitotic spindle; and steps 2.7 to 2.11 allow to isolate, count and
measure the length of single centrioles. Our current implementation of these
algorithms allows to perform manual curation at steps 1.4 and 2.10 (Fig. 1b). The
overall analysis of centriole number and length is depicted in Figs 2 and 3,
respectively. Two different population parameters, namely, the mean and the
variance-to-mean ratio (VMR), were used to compare centriole length between the
different cell lines Fig. 3b.

Transmission electron microscopy. Pellets of cells were fixed using 2.5% glu-
taraldehyde, in a 1× PBS solution, for 30 min at room temperature and postfixed
with 1% Osmium tetroxide (OsO4) solution for 1 h at 4 °C. The samples were
stained en bloc with 2% uranyl acetate for 20 min and dehydrated in a graded series
of ethanol. The samples were treated with propylene oxide for 15 min, followed by
a 1:1 mix of propylene oxide and resin for 15 min and a pure resin incubation for 1
h. The samples were polymerised at 60 °C for 24 h. Serial sections (60–120 nm)
were taken on a Leica Reichert Ultracut S ultramicrotome, collected on formvar-
coated copper slot grids, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The
sections were analysed at 100 kV on a Hitachi 7650 TEM. Centriole length
quantification was performed from TEM images of longitudinal sections of cen-
trioles using Image J software.
CPAP overexpression in T47D, SF268 and U2OS cells. U2OS, T47D and SF268
cells were transfected with either peGFP-C hCPAP (kind gift from Juliette
Azimzadeh), or pLJ499-EYFP plasmid (kind gift from Lars Jansen’s laboratory),
using the Neon® Transfection system. The following parameters were respectively
used for T47D, SF268 and U2OS: 1700, 1300 and 1200 V Pulse voltage, 20, 30 and
10 ms pulse width and 1, 1 and 4 pulses were used.
For U2OS, cells were either pelleted for further TEM processing (see
Transmission electron microscopy section above) or incubated for 1 h on ice to
induce the depolymerisation of cytoplasmic microtubules after 48, 72 or 96 h of
overexpression. Subsequently, cells were stained with DAPI, CEP135 (1/500
dilution, kind gift from Ryoko Kuriyama) and acetylated tubulin (1/500 dilution,
Sigma, Ref. T7451) antibodies (Immunofluorescence staining section for more
experimental details).
The number and length of centrioles was quantified using the maximum
intensity projection of the acetylated tubulin staining. Only centrioles positive for
at least two of the centriolar markers used (CPAP, acetylated tubulin or CEP135)
were analysed. Three independent experiments were performed. For the centriole
length quantification, 100 centrioles were measured per condition and per
experiment. A Mann–Whitney test was used to compare centriole length between
different conditions (see Supplementary Fig. 9c); a two-tailed 5% significance level
was considered as statistically significant (p < 0.05). To obtain the percentage of
cells with >4 centrioles, 100 cells were counted per condition and per experiment.
Similar experiments were performed for the centrinone B assay (see Supplementary
Fig. 9d), except that cells were incubated with centrinone B (500 nM) or DMSO
(negative control) 24 h prior transfection and throughout the entire time course of
the experiment.
For T47D and SF268 cells, cells were either incubated for 2 h on ice prior to
fixation to induce the depolymerisation of cytoplasmic microtubules (PCM
quantification) or directly fixed with cold methanol (10 min at −20 °C, centriole
number and chromosome segregation defects quantifications) after 48 or 96 h
overexpression, respectively. For PCM quantification, we decided to restrict our
analysis to one PCM component (pericentrin), as both pericentrin and γ-tubulin
quantifications gave similar results in MDA-MB-435, HOP-62 and RPE cells (Fig. 6
and Supplementary Fig. 11). Therefore, T47D and SF268 cells were stained with
DAPI, acetylated tubulin (1/500 dilution, Sigma, Ref. T7451) and pericentrin (1/
250 dilution, ref. AB44489 Abcam) antibodies. For centriole number and
chromosomal instability quantifications, cells were stained with DAPI, alpha-
tubulin (1/200, ref. AB18251, Abcam) and centrin-1 (1/1000 dilution, clone 20H5,
Millipore) antibodies.
For PCM quantification, we restricted our analysis to 48 h samples as centriole
structures really become very defective upon CPAP overexpression making the
analysis too difficult at later time points. Even with this restriction, centriole
structures were too defective to apply the macro designed for PCM quantification
in MDA-MB-435, HOP-62 and RPE (see below). As an alternative, we measured
pericentrin fluorescence intensities at each centrosome using Image J software.
Briefly, we created the sum intensity z-projections and measured the raw integrated
density of regions of interest (ROI) around each centrosome. To correct for
background fluorescence, we measured the raw integrated densities of region of
same size of the ROI that were outside centrosomes but within the cell. Three
independent experiments were performed with around 30 centrosomes accounted
per condition and per experiment. Note that the quantification was performed in
interphasic cells as the mitotic content was too low. A Mann–Whitney statistical
test was used to compare pericentrin densities between different conditions
(Fig. 6b).
For both centriole number and chromosomal instability quantifications, we
focused our analysis on the 96 h sample to study the long-term effect of centriole
length deregulation. For centriole number quantification (Fig. 5b), centrin was used
as a readout to count centrioles in mitotic cells. Three independent experiments
were performed (between 80 and 140 cells were counted per condition and per
experiment). A one-tailed unpaired t test with Welch’s correction was used to
compare centriole number between different conditions (see Fig. 5b).
To assess chromosomal instability, we first quantified the percentage of
multipolar mitosis during prometaphase and metaphase using α-tubulin staining
(Fig. 6e). Three independent experiments were performed (between 30 and 87
mitosis were accounted per condition and per experiment). A one-tailed z score
test was performed the compare the proportion of multipolar mitosis between
conditions. Second, we scored different types of chromosome segregation defects
during anaphase-telophase: polar asymmetry (chromosome(s) in the vicinity of one
of the two spindle poles at anaphase onset), DNA/chromosome bridge (“string-
like” connection between the two masses of segregating chromosomes), lagging
chromosome (chromosomes that lag between the two masses of segregating
chromosomes), DNA/chromosome protrusion (improperly aligned chromosome/
DNA that probably results from bridges) and multipolar mitosis (Fig. 6f and
Supplementary Fig. 12c). Three independent experiments were performed
(between 38 and 55 mitosis were accounted per condition and per experiment). A
one-tailed zscore test was performed the compare the proportion of chromosome
segregation defects between conditions.
Structured illuminated microscopy. MDA-MB-435, HOP-62 and RPE-1 cells
were incubated 2 h on ice to induce the depolymerisation of cytoplasmic micro-
tubules, and were subsequently stained with DAPI, acetylated tubulin (1/1000
dilution, Ref. T7451, Sigma) and STIL (1/500 dilution, Ref. A302-441A, Bethyl
laboratories) antibodies (for more details, Immunofluorescence staining section).
Super-Resolution images were acquired using an LSM780 ELYRA PS1 (SR-SIM)
microscope (Zeiss), and a ×63 objective. Images were collected with five grid
rotations, using a 1.513 refractive index oil at room temperature. Post-acquisition
processing of images, including structured illumination reconstruction, was done
using Zen (Zeiss).
Age-related centriole staining. MDA-MB-435 cells were incubated for 2 h on ice
to induce the depolymerisation of cytoplasmic microtubules. Subsequently, cell
lines were stained with DAPI, acetylated tubulin (1/1000 dilution, Ref. T7451,
Sigma), STIL (1/500 dilution, Ref. A302-441A, Bethyl laboratories) and eventually
CEP164 (1/700 dilution, Ref. SC240226, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies (for
more details, Immunofluorescence staining section). The number of overly long
centriole(s) per cell (Supplementary Fig. 5b) was determined using acetylated
tubulin staining, as a readout for centriole length, and the age of centrioles was
assessed using STIL staining (absence = mother, presence = daughter, Supple-
mentary Fig. 5c). In addition, the presence of ectopic procentriole was accounted
when overly long centrioles possessed at least two STIL dots along their length
(Supplementary Fig. 10c). Centrioles were considered as overly long when they
were at least approximately twice the size of normal-length centrioles. Three
independent experiments were performed with at least 68 cells displaying long
centriole(s) analysed per experiment.

 Cilia staining. MDA-MB-435 and HOP-62 cells were incubated for 2 h on ice to
induce the depolymerisation of cytoplasmic microtubules. Subsequently,
cell lines were subjected to an IF assay using DAPI and two different marker
combinations: (i) centrin-2 (1/500 dilution, Ref. sc-27793-R, Santa Cruz Bio-
technology) and acetylated tubulin antibodies (1/500 dilution, Sigma, Ref. T7451),
to visualise the long centrin-positive rod-like structures and stable MTs
present in centriole and cilia, respectively; (ii) centrin-1 (1/1000 dilution, clone
20H5, Millipore) and ARL13B (1/500 dilution, kind gift from T. Caspary), to label
the long centrin-positive rod-like structures and cilia, respectively (for more
experimental details, Immunofluorescence staining section). The visual examina-
tion of the presence of acetylated tubulin, or ARL13B, on the long centrin-
positive rod-like structures was performed on an Applied Precision Deltavi-
sionCORE system (for representative pictures see Supplementary Fig. 4). These
structures were considered as overly long when they were at least approximately
twice the size of normal-length centrioles. Three independent experiments were
performed, with at least 30 overly long centrioles analysed per condition and per
experiment.
PCM components quantification. RPE-1, MDA-MB-435 and HOP-62 cell lines
were incubated 2 h on ice to induce the depolymerisation of cytoplasmic micro-
tubules, and were subsequently stained with DAPI and two different marker
combinations to visualise both centrioles and PCM: (i) centrin-2 (1/500 dilution,
Ref. sc-27793-R, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and γ-tubulin (1/25 dilution, ref.
GTU88, Sigma), (ii) centrin-1 (1/1000 dilution, clone 20H5, Millipore) and peri-
centrin (1/250 dilution, ref. AB44489 Abcam). For more experimental details,
please see the Immunofluorescence staining section.
For the PCM quantification, acquired data (see “Primary immunofluorescence
screening” section for technical details) were processed and quantified with Fiji
(ImageJ distribution69). Centrosome detection was performed on a Maximum
Intensity projection, using Yen automatic threshold algorithm, to get a minimum
threshold value to be used as a reference for 3D Object Counter plugin70.
Total centrin and pericentrin/γ-tubulin sum intensities of all voxels of a
centrosome were obtained by 3D Object Counter’s Integrated Density parameter. A
local background value was calculated for each centrosome by creating the average
intensity projection and multiplying this value by the number of voxel of each 3D
object to get the contribution of the background/noise to the total measured
Integrated Density. The Centrosome fluorescence signal was then calculated by
subtracting the background integrated density to the object total integrated density.
The centrin and pericentrin or γ-tubulin integrated densities were plotted against
each other to investigate if centriole length and PCM content are correlated in the
two cell lines displaying centriole over-elongation, MDA-MB-435 and HOP-62
(Supplementary Fig. 11b, c). Three independent experiments were performed, and
at least 250 centrosomes were quantified per cell line and per PCM component.
The Spearman correlation coefficient was calculated and the two parameters were
considered correlated if p < 0.05.
To further push the analysis, we took advantage of the fact that mitoses were
often visually displaying asymmetric centriole content in MDA-MB-435 cell line to
directly compare, at the single cell level, the PCM recruitment ability of
centrosomes containing overly long centrioles versus centrosomes with normal-
length centrioles. Please note that we used RPE-1 and MDA-MB-435 cells with
only normal-length centrioles as controls. For mitosis with normal-length
centrioles (named “Normal-length”), the pericentrin or γ-tubulin integrated
density of the pole with higher centrin intensity was normalised to the integrated
density of the pole with lower centrin intensity. For mitotic cells with an
asymmetric content of centrioles, the pericentrin or γ-tubulin integrated density of
the pole containing longer centriole(s) was normalised to the integrated density of
the other pole. Centrioles were considered as overly long when they were at least
twice the size of normal-length centrioles. Three independent experiments were
performed (between 37 and 62 centrosomes were quantified per condition and per
experiment). One-tailed unpaired t tests with Welch’s correction were used to
compare samples.
MT regrowth assays. RPE-1 and MDA-MB-435 cells were incubated 2 h
on ice to induce the depolymerisation of cytoplasmic microtubules. After these 2 h,
freshly-warmed media was added to the cells and the plates were put at
37 °C for 45 s to allow MTs regrowth and subsequently fixed and stained with
DAPI, centrin-1 (1/1000 dilution, clone 20H5, Millipore) and alpha-tubulin (1/200,
ref. AB18251, Abcam) (for more experimental details, Immunofluorescence
staining section). The α-tubulin and centrin fluorescence intensities were measured
at each centrosome using Image J software. Briefly, mitotic cells were manually
selected and the area outside the selection was erased using the “clear outside”
function. To correct for background fluorescence, the min intensity z-projections
were created allowing for average intensity value measurement. These values were
subtracted from each stack and, then, the sum intensity z-projections were created
and the raw integrated densities of region of interest around each centrosome were
measured.
To directly investigate the effect of the variable “centriole length” on the ability
to recruit PCM, the α-tubulin raw integrated density of the pole with higher centrin
intensity was normalised to the raw integrated density of the pole with lower
centrin intensity in mitosis with normal-length centrioles (named “Normal-
length”). For mitotic cells with an asymmetric content of centrioles, the α-tubulin
integrated density of the pole containing longer centriole(s) was normalised to the
integrated density of the other pole. Note that centrioles were only considered as
overly long when they were approximately at least twice the size of normal-length
ones. Three independent experiments were performed (between 30 and 82
centrosomes were accounted per condition and per experiment). A one-tailed
unpaired t test with Welch’s correction was used to compare the different
conditions.
Quantification of chromosome segregation defects. MDA-MB-435 cells lines
stained with DAPI, to visualise DNA, and CENPB antibodies (1/200 dilution71), to
label centromeres. For centrioles, a double staining was performed using centrin-1
(1/1000 dilution, clone 20H5, Millipore) and CP110 (1/250 dilution, homemade)
antibodies. The green channel was used to visualise both centromeres and centrioles
(centrin antibody), since these structures have distinct locations in the cell (for more
experimental details, Immunofluorescence staining section). Images of anaphases
and telophase were taken as Z-stacks on an Applied Precision DeltavisionCORE
system using a ×100 1.4 NA Oil immersion objective and were blindly deconvolved
with Applied Precision’s SoftWorx software. Subsequently, these images were scored
for different types of chromosome segregation defects: polar asymmetry (chromo-
some(s) in the vicinity of one of the two spindle poles at anaphase onset), DNA/
chromosome bridge (“string-like” connection between the two masses of segregating
chromosomes), lagging chromosome (chromosomes that lag between the two
masses of segregating chromosomes) and DNA/chromosome protrusion (impro-
perly aligned chromosome/DNA that probably results from bridges).
Three independent experiments were performed, in which we analysed only
cells displaying normal-length centrioles or cells exhibiting overly long centriole(s)
at one spindle pole (200 cells were counted per experiment). Note that centrioles
were only considered as overly long when they were approximately at least twice
longer than normal-length ones. A z score test was used to compare the overall
proportions of anaphases and telophases with chromosome segregation defects
between the two groups of cells, p = 0.0001.
