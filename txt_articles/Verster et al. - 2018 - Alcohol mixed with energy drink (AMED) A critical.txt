Abstract
The purpose of this systematic review and meta‐analysis was to critically review the (1) preva-
lence of alcohol mixed with energy drink (AMED) consumption, (2) motives for AMED consump-
tion, (3) correlates of AMED consumption, and (4) whether AMED consumption has an impact on
(a) alcohol consumption, (b) subjective intoxication, and (c) risk‐taking behavior.
Overall a minority of the population consumes AMED, typically infrequently. Motives for AMED
consumption are predominantly hedonistic and social. Meta‐analyses revealed that AMED con-
sumers drink significantly more alcohol than alcohol‐only (AO) consumers. Within‐subject com-
parisons restricted to AMED consumers revealed that alcohol consumption does not
significantly differ between typical AMED and AO occasions. On past month heaviest drinking
occasions, AMED users consume significantly less alcohol on AMED occasions when compared
to AO occasions. AMED consumers experience significantly fewer negative consequences and
risk‐taking behavior on AMED occasions compared with AO occasions. Meta‐analyses of subjective
intoxication studies suggest that AMED consumption does not differentially affect subjective intox-
ication when compared to AO consumption. In conclusion, when compared to AO consumption,
mixing alcohol with energy drink does not affect subjective intoxication and seems unlikely to
increase total alcohol consumption, associated risk‐taking behavior, nor other negative alcohol‐
related consequences. Further research may be necessary to fully reveal the effects of AMED.

INTRODUCTION
Since their introduction, energy drinks have become increasingly
popular. Energy drinks are nonalcoholic beverages that currently
constitute less than 5% of the soft drink market.
Energy drinks contain caffeine and other functional ingredients
such as glucose, B‐vitamins, glucuronolactone, and taurine. Sometimes,
these are complemented with herbal extracts such as ginseng, Ginkgo
biloba, and guaraná. There is some evidence that caffeine and glucose
may have additive effects on aspects of cognitive performance (Scholey
and Kennedy, 2004). Limited studies into the effects of other
ingredients conclude that caffeine is largely responsible for most cogni-
tive effects of energy drinks (Giles et al., 2012; Peacock, Bruno, & Mar-
tin, 2013. In addition, caffeine consumption via energy drinks, especially
when mixed with alcohol, has raised several concerns discussed in this
systematic review.
Whereas popular energy drinks such as Red Bull (250 ml, 8.4 oz)
contain 80 mg of caffeine, comparable to the amount of caffeine
present in one regular cup of coffee, some energy drinks contain
substantially higher levels. Despite the increasing popularity of energy
drinks, consumption trends for adults show that total daily caffeine
intake has remained stable over the past decade (Verster & Konig,

 2017). The introduction of energy drinks has not resulted in an
increase in total daily caffeine consumption. In fact, total caffeine
consumption of children younger than 12 years has significantly
declined
over
the
past
10
years,
and
adolescent
caffeine
consumption has remained stable (Verster & Konig, 2017). Among
children and adolescents, however, over the past 15 years, a significant
reduction of caffeinated soft drink consumption is seen, accompanied
by an increase of coffee consumption (Verster & Konig, 2017).
In line with previous assessments (Health Canada, 2010; Nawrot,
Jordan, Eastwood, et al., 2003), the European Food Safety Authority
concluded that, for adults, caffeine consumption up to 400 mg per
day does not give rise to safety concerns (European Food Safety Author-
ity, 2015). For children and adolescents, not exceeding 3 mg/kg body
weight per day was recommended, and for pregnant women, maximum
daily caffeine intake was set at 200 mg per day. The recent review by
Verster and Konig (2017) shows that across the world, average daily caf-
feine intake is below these levels. The contribution of energy drinks to
total caffeine intake is relatively low across all age groups.
Nevertheless, some researchers and health organizations have
expressed concern regarding the potential health risks associated
with mixing alcohol and energy drink. On the basis of the existing
literature, Verster, Aufricht, and Alford (2012) identified three poten-
tial health risks:
1. Mixing alcohol with energy drink would increase total alcohol
consumption when compared to consuming alcohol only (AO).
2. Mixing alcohol with energy drink would mask the intoxication effects
caused by alcohol (i.e., alcohol mixed with energy drink [AMED]
consumers would feel less intoxicated when mixing alcohol with
energy drink than when consuming the same level of AO).
3. Mixing alcohol with energy drink would result in increased risk‐
taking behavior and experiencing negative alcohol‐related conse-
quences (e.g., drunk driving and unprotected sex).
In the 2012 review (Verster et al., 2012), developed by most of
this paper's authors, we addressed these three topics and concluded
that “Although some reports suggest that energy drinks lead to
reduced awareness of intoxication and increased alcohol consumption,
a review of the available literature shows that these views are not
supported by direct or reliable scientific evidence.” Also regarding
consumption patterns and their possible negative consequences, it
was concluded that supportive research was too limited to be able to
draw firm conclusions. We did however postulate that “a personality
with higher levels of risk‐taking behavior may be the primary reason
for
increased
alcohol
and
drug
abuse
per
se”
with
“the
co‐consumption of energy drinks being one of the many expressions
of that type of lifestyle and personality” (Verster et al., 2012).
Over the past 5 years, a large number of scientific studies have
addressed the proposed concerns with consuming AMED as opposed
to consuming AO. Here, we revisit those areas with an updated review
of the extant literature. This is important, because among both
researchers and lay people, there are persisting misconceptions and
myths about the effects of mixing alcohol with energy drink that are
not supported by scientific evidence.

METHODS
A literature search (PubMed, Embase, and PsycLit) was conducted
using the keywords “energy drink” and “alcohol,” covering all years
up to March 2, 2017. The literature search revealed 1,039 hits. After
removing 290 duplicates, a total of 749 papers remained of which
the abstracts and full text were screened.
The aim of this review was to give a critical review on (1) the
prevalence of AMED consumption, (2) the motives for AMED
consumption, (3) the correlates of AMED consumption, and (4)
whether AMED consumption has an impact on (a) alcohol consump-
tion, (b) subjective intoxication, and (c) risk‐taking behavior. Articles
addressing these topics and providing data were included in this
review. Reviews, commentaries, and editorials were not considered,
leaving 80 original articles that were included in the current review.
There were sufficient data on alcohol consumption and subjective
intoxication
to
allow
meta‐analyses.
The
meta‐analyses
were
conducted using the program Comprehensive Meta‐analysis (Biostat
Inc., Englewood, NJ, USA; Borenstein & Rothstein, 1999). Studies were
included if outcome measures were reported that could be used to
calculate effect sizes (ES), such as the mean, standard deviation, and
sample size. The ES and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
were computed for each of the AMED versus AO comparisons. If the
95% CI did not include zero, the ES was considered statistically signif-
icant (p < .05). Homogeneity/heterogeneity analyses were performed
to determine if each individual ES had the same distribution as the
combined overall ES. If the Q statistic resulting from this analysis was
not significant (p ≥ .05), a homogenous distribution was assumed and
a fixed effects model to perform the meta‐analysis was applied. If
not, a random effects model was applied, correcting for variation
between the studies (Lipsey & Wilson, 2000).

RESULTS

Prevalence of AMED consumption
Surveys among U.S. students and young adults reported AMED
consumption to vary from 8.1% to 64.7% of their cohorts (Berger,
Fendrich, & Fuhrman, 2013; Emond, Gilbert‐Diamond, Tanski, &
Sargent, 2014; Gonzales, Largo, Miller, Kanny, & Brewer, 2015;
Housman, Williams, & Woolsey, 2016; Martz, Patrick, & Schulenberg,
2015; Marzell, Turrisi, Mallett, Ray, & Scaglione, 2014; Miller, 2012; Pat-
rick, Macuada, & Maggs, 2016; Rutledge, Bestrashniy, & Nelson, 2016;
Snipes & Benotsch, 2013; Snipes, Green, Javier, Perrin, & Benotsch,
2014; Snipes, Jeffers, Green, & Benotsch, 2015). Among U.S. active‐duty
Navy and Marine Corps, 28% reported consuming AMED (Knapik et al.,
2016). Reported rates of past year AMED consumption were consider-
ably lower among Canadian student samples, ranging from 17.3% to
20% (Azagba, Langille, & Asbridge, 2013; Milicic & Leatherdale,
2016; Reid, Hammond, McCrory, Dubin, & Leatherdale, 2015).
Among young Australian adults, AMED consumption ranged from
21.1% to 77% (Peacock et al., 2013; Pennay et al., 2014). In Europe,
AMED consumption was reported by 3.4% of Slovakian adolescents
(Holubcikova et al., 2016), 10.6% of Polish adolescent athletes (Nowak
2 of 19
VERSTER ET AL.
 & Jasionowski, 2016), 20.6% of Dutch students (De Haan, de Haan,
van der Palen, Olivier, & Verster, 2012), 39.0% of U.K. students (John-
son, Alford, Stewart, & Verster, 2016; Johnson, Alford, Verster, & Stewart,
2016), 44.4% of Italian students (Vitiello, Diolordi, Donini, & del Balzo,
2016), and 46.1% of Italian teenagers (Flotta et al., 2014). Among Brazilian
students and teenagers, AMED consumption was reported by 12.9% to
31% (Bitancourt, Ribeiro Grilli Tissot, Marques Fidalgo, Fernandes
Galdurόz, & da Silveira Filho, 2016; Eckschmidt, Guerra de Andrade, dos
Santos, & Garcia de Oliviera, 2013; Locatelli, Sanchez, Opaleye, Carlini,
& Noto, 2012), and 38% of Puerto Rican students reported AMED con-
sumption (Cabezas‐Bou et al., 2016).
Various criteria were used to classify someone as an AMED
consumer, ranging from “ever consumed AMED at least once during
their life,” to past year consumption, or past month consumption.
Otherwise,
drinkers
were
simply
classified
as
current
AMED
consumers. This may explain the broad range of percentages of AMED
consumers reported across different studies. It should also be stressed
that these samples typically comprise students and thus may not be repre-
sentative of the general population. Also, as the majority of studies used
convenience samples, it is unclear whether the observed percentages
are representative of the wider student population they were drawn from.
The broad range in percentages (ranging from 3.4% to 77%) reported in
these studies should therefore be interpreted with caution and not used
to illustrate AMED consumption in the general population.
Indeed, studies that have examined AMED consumption in random
samples of adults not restricted to students have reported much lower
rates of AMED consumption. For example, from a random sample of
2,000 Australians 18 years and older, 4.6% of participants reported past
month AMED consumption (Pennay et al., 2015), and among a large ran-
dom sample of the Taiwanese working population, only 6.0% of 13,501
men and 0.7% of 8,584 women reported consuming AMED (Cheng,
Cheng, Huang, & Chen, 2012). Of a Canadian national representative
sample of never‐smoking students (Grades 9–12), 13% reported con-
suming at least one AMED during the past year (Azagba & Sharaf, 2014).

Motives for AMED consumption
In our previous review, only three studies were included that described
motives
for
AMED
consumption.
Malinauskas,
Aeby,
Overton,
Carpenter‐Aeby, and Barber‐Heidal (2007) reported that about half
of college students (54%) reported AMED consumption “during party-
ing.” O'Brien, McCoy, Rhodes, Wagoner, and Wolfson (2008) surveyed
U.S. students and reported percentages of AMED consumers drinking
AMED “to hide the flavor of alcohol” (55%), “to drink more and not feel
as drunk” (15%), to “not get a hangover” (7%), or “to drink more and not
look as drunk” (5%). Marczinski (2011) surveyed 66 regular U.S. energy
drink consumers on their motives for AMED consumption using a scale
ranging from 1 (highly disagree) to 4 (highly agree). The most important
motives for AMED consumption were “like the taste” (mean 3.02), “to
celebrate” (3.00), “to socialize” (2.95), and “to get drunk” (2.82).
During the past 5 years, several studies have further addressed this
topic. Peacock, Bruno, and Martin (2013) investigated motives for AMED
consumption in 403 young Australian adults. Most frequently endorsed
motives were “hedonistic motives” and “taste and sensation” related,
including “because I like the taste of alcohol and energy drinks together”
(69%) and “because I like the taste of energy drinks” (57%). Functional
motives including “To feel more energetic” (70%) and “So I could stay
out later” (54%) and situational motives such as “Because they are the
ingredients in a drink (e.g., Jägerbomb)” (72%) were also frequently
reported. To a lesser extent, intoxication‐ and impairment‐related
motives were endorsed, including “to get more drunk” (32%), “so I could
drink more” (20%), “to feel less drunk” (12%), “to look less drunk” (8%),
and “to avoid getting a hangover” (6%). In a subsequent paper, Peacock,
Droste, Pennay, Miller et al. (2015) examined motives for AMED con-
sumption among a community sample of 731 Young Australian adults
and 594 Australian university students. Participants were divided into
four groups corresponding to their primary motives for AMED consump-
tion: (a) taste (31%), (b) energy seeking (24%), (c) hedonistic (33%), and (d)
intoxication‐related motives (12%). No significant differences were
found between the groups regarding demographics or alcohol and drug
use, alcohol consumption on AMED sessions, and AMED consumption‐
related risk taking. Finally, Peacock et al. (2016) examined the motives
for AMED consumption of 693 Australian ecstasy users. Participants
reported consuming AMED to increase alertness (59%), for the taste
(25%), to party for longer (23%), and to combat fatigue (16%).
Droste et al., 2014 examined motives for AMED consumption in 594
Australian students. Factor analysis identified four types of motives, which
were categorized as being related to either “hedonic,” “social,” “energy/
endurance,”
and
“intoxication
reduction”
factors.
Among
AMED
consumers, having hedonic motives was associated with consuming
significantly more alcohol, and having intoxication‐reduction motives
was associated with experiencing significantly more alcohol‐related harm
outcomes during the past 3 months. The authors did not infer whether
these harmful events, including verbal, physical, and sexual aggression or
experiencing alcohol‐related accidents or injury, were experienced on
AMED or AO occasions.
Flotta et al. (2014) surveyed 870 Italian teenagers aged 15 to
19 years. Motives for AMED consumption that were rated as either
highly important or important included “to celebrate/to party” (10.3%
and 26.6%, respectively), “to socialize” (8.2% and 19.1%), and because
they “like the taste” (6.1% and 14.9%). Motives that were rated “not at
all important” included “to get work done” (53.5%), “because it's cheap”
(48.7%), “to feel more comfortable with the opposite sex” (48.5%), and
“because everyone else is doing it” (48.1%). Only 12.2% of the sample
endorsed “to get drunk” as an important motive to consume AMED.
Bonar et al. (2015) interviewed 439 U.S. youths, aged 14–20 years,
who were seeking emergency department care for any reason. Of
these, 158 consumed AMED during the past year (36%). Primary
motives included “to hide the flavor of alcohol” (39.2%), “like the taste”
(35.8%), “stay awake” (32.3%), and “need more energy, in general”
(28.5%). To a much lesser extent “drink more and not look as drunk”
(2.5%) and “drink more and not feel as drunk” (7.6%) were endorsed.
Magnezi, Bergman, Grinvald‐Vogel, and Cohen (2015) conducted
a survey among 802 Israeli youths, aged 14 to 18 years. The most com-
monly reported motive for AMED consumption was “to improve the
taste of their alcoholic beverage” (80.6%). To a lesser extent, partici-
pants endorsed consuming AMED “to feel intoxicated” (24.6%), “out
of curiosity” (14.6%), “to feel awake” (13.9%), “to consume more alco-
hol” (11.7%), “for social reasons” (10.4%), and “to reduce the side
effects of alcohol” (8.4%).
VERSTER ET AL.

 In another Italian study, Vitiello et al. (2016) surveyed 1,007
students, of which 44.4% acknowledged consuming AMED. Motives
for AMED consumption included “because I like it” (63.4%), “because
I can maintain high activity levels throughout the night” (14.6%),
“because I feel euphoric” (12.2%), “because I end up drinking less
alcohol” (6.5%), and “because I can concentrate better” (3.3%).
On‐premise interviews with a small group (N = 10) of Australian
bar patrons revealed that functional outcomes (e.g., maintaining wake-
fulness) were the most important motives for AMED consumption,
followed to a lesser extent by social bonding, alcohol taste masking,
and facilitating alcohol intoxication (Pennay & Lubman, 2012). Focus
group discussions and interviews with 41 young Australian AMED
consumers also identified social and functional motives as the most
important reasons for AMED consumption (Pettigrew et al., 2016).
In
the
Netherlands,
Verster,
Benson,
and
Scholey
(2014)
conducted a survey among 6,002 university students, of whom,
1,239 reported consuming AMED. The most frequently reported
motives for AMED consumption were “I like the taste” (81.1%), “I
wanted to drink something else” (35.3%), and “to celebrate a special
occasion” (14.6%). About one in five students (21.6%) also reported
at least one negative motive to consume AMED, including “to get
drunk” (8.0%), “it feels like it reduces the negative effects of alcohol”
(6.9%), “it feels like I can drink more alcohol” (5.6%), “to prevent getting
drunk” (3.8%), and “to sober up” (2.9%). Interestingly, in this study, the
same motives were also rated for mixing alcohol with other nonalco-
holic beverages (e.g., tonic or cola), and it appeared that these were
quite similar to the motives for consuming AMED. When students
rated motives for their other preferred nonalcoholic mixers, the most
frequently reported motives were also “I like the taste” (90.2%), “I
wanted to drink something else” (42.6%), and “to celebrate a special
occasion” (14.9%). Negative motives included “it feels like it reduces
the negative effects of alcohol” (5.1%) and “it feels like I can drink more
alcohol” (6.5%), and students significantly more often endorsed the
items “to get drunk” (10.9%), “to prevent getting drunk” (9.0%), and
“to sober up” (6.0%), when compared to motives for mixing alcohol
with energy drink. However, only a minority of students endorsed
these negative motives.
Johnson, Alford, Verster, et al. (2016) replicated the study by Verster
et al. (2014) in a sample of 1,873 U.K. students. The most frequently
endorsed motives for AMED consumption were “I like the taste”
(66.5%), “to celebrate a special occasion” (35.3%), and “I wanted to drink
something else” (25.1%). In contrast to the Dutch sample where 8.0%
reported consuming AMED “to get drunk,” an increased number
(45.6%) of U.K. students reported this motive. Also, other negative
motives such as “it feels like it reduces the negative effects of alcohol”
(10.8%) and “it feels like I can drink more alcohol” (10.0%) were more fre-
quently endorsed when compared to the Dutch student sample. Those
who endorsed at least one negative motive (52.6% of the sample) were
significantly more often male, younger, a smoker, had an earlier age of
onset of regular alcohol consumption, and reported experiencing signifi-
cantly more negative alcohol‐related consequences when compared to
AMED consumers who endorsed only neutral motives.
When compared to other mixers such as tonic or cola, endorse-
ment rates of neutral motives were quite comparable for mixing
alcohol with energy drink. The items “to get drunk” and “it feels like
it reduces the negative effects of alcohol” were significantly more
often endorsed for AMED consumption, whereas the motive “it feels
like I can drink more alcohol” was significantly more endorsed for
mixing alcohol with other beverages (18.9%).
Cobb, Nasim, Jentink, and Blank (2015) surveyed 1,174 U.S.
undergraduate students. Motives for consumption were recorded for
(a) premixed AMED drinks, (b) self‐mixed AMED drinks, and (c) other
nonalcoholic caffeinated beverages mixed with alcohol. The most
frequently endorsed motives were “to hide the flavor of alcohol”
(49.2%, 61.8%, and 81.4%, respectively), “I can drink less and get
drunk” (45.9%, 17.6%, and 17.5%), “it is the only mixer available at
parties” (18.4%, 17.6%, and 34.0%), and “I can stay alert while drinking”
(26.5%, 35.3%, and 12.4%). Less frequently endorsed were “to drink
more and not feel as drunk” (9.2%, 5.9%, and 8.2%) and “to drink more
and not look as drunk” (4.9%, 0%, and 4.1%).

Characteristics of AMED consumers
A large number of studies have examined dispositional characteristics
of AMED consumers. These studies either correlated AMED consump-
tion with a variety of behaviors and personality characteristics (associ-
ation studies) or directly compared AMED consumers with other
drinkers that consume AO. Finally, some studies have examined
whether different types of AMED consumers exist. The outcomes of
these studies are summarized in the following sections.
3.3.1
|
Associations with AMED consumption
Many studies have examined behaviors and demographics that may be
associated with the consumption of AMED. These studies are of a
cross‐sectional nature, using correlations or regression models to deter-
mine whether certain variables are related to AMED consumption.
Significant associations have been reported between AMED
consumption and binge drinking (Gonzales et al., 2015; Emond et al.,
2014; Martz et al., 2015; Patrick et al., 2016; Pennay et al., 2015; Reid
et al., 2015), drunkenness (Kristjansson, Mann, Sigfusdottir, & James,
2015), increased alcohol intake, higher blood alcohol concentrations
(BACs; Arria, Caldeira, Bugbee, Vincent, & O'Grady, 2016; Azagba
et al., 2013; Bonar, Green, & Asfrafioun, 2017; Brache & Stockwell,
2011; Cheng et al., 2012; O'Brien et al., 2008; Pennay et al., 2014;
Woolsey, Waigandt, & Beck, 2010), hazardous drinking (Bonar et al.,
2015; Eckschmidt et al., 2013), risk of alcohol use disorder (Emond
et al., 2014), risk for alcohol dependence (Cheng et al., 2012; Droste
et al., 2014; Snipes et al., 2015), and gambling (Pennay et al., 2015).
AMED consumers are significantly more likely to be male (Berger
et al., 2011; Bonar et al., 2015; Cheng et al., 2012; Eckschmidt et al.,
2013; Flotta et al., 2014; Housman et al., 2016; Martz et al., 2015;
Pennay et al., 2015; Snipes et al., 2014; Wells et al., 2013); young
(Azagba et al., 2013; Berger et al., 2011; Pennay et al., 2015; Rutledge
et al., 2016; Wells et al., 2013); White (Berger et al., 2011), Black or
Hispanic (Martz et al., 2015), and Black or other (Azagba et al., 2013;
Reid et al., 2015); single (Eckschmidt et al., 2013); a fraternity or soror-
ity member (Patrick et al., 2016); participate in athletics (Patrick et al.,
2016) or team sports (Azagba et al., 2013); live off campus (Patrick
et al., 2016); and have three or more evenings out per week (Martz
et al., 2015). AMED consumption has also been associated with
4 of 19
VERSTER ET AL.
 increased impulsivity (Snipes et al., 2015), lower anxiety sensitivity
(Snipes et al., 2015), and moderate (but not low and high) psychological
distress (Pennay et al., 2015).
In students, AMED consumption has been associated with having
a lower grade point average (Martz et al., 2015); more often having a
1‐year class cut (Martz et al., 2015); absence from school (Azagba
et al., 2013); students having more weekly spending money (Azagba
et al., 2013; Reid et al., 2015); and endorsing greater fun/social, relax-
ation, and image motives for drinking (Patrick et al., 2016). In workers,
AMED consumption was significantly more common in those with
manually skilled occupations, with working hours <40 hr or longer than
49 hr per week, in occupations with lower job control, and (in aTaiwan-
ese working population) being on piece‐rated or time‐based pay
systems (Cheng et al., 2012).
AMED consumption was associated with higher susceptibility to
smoking (Azagba et al., 2013, Bonar et al., 2017, Flotta et al., 2014,
Khan, Cottler, & Striley, 2016), the use of electronic cigarettes (Milicic
& Leatherdale, 2016), marijuana use (Azagba et al., 2013; Flotta et al.,
2014; Khan et al., 2016; Martz et al., 2015; Snipes & Benotsch,
2013), cocaine use (Snipes & Benotsch, 2013), ecstasy use (Snipes &
Benotsch, 2013), the use of other illicit drugs (Bonar et al., 2015; Bonar
et al., 2017; Martz et al., 2015), and nonmedical use of prescription
stimulants (Housman et al., 2016; Khan et al., 2016).
Significant
associations
were
also
found
between
AMED
consumption and increased risk of casual sex (Miller, 2012), intoxicated
sex (Miller, 2012; Snipes & Benotsch, 2013), unprotected sex (Berger
et al., 2013; Snipes & Benotsch, 2013), sex under the influence of drugs
(Bonar et al., 2015; Snipes & Benotsch, 2013), having an increased num-
ber of sexual partners (Flotta et al., 2014; Snipes & Benotsch, 2013), and
sexual victimization in men, but not in women (Snipes et al., 2014). Also,
significant associations were found between AMED consumption and
being more likely to experience negative alcohol‐related consequences
(Berger et al., 2013; Brache & Stockwell, 2011; De Haan et al., 2012;
O'Brien et al., 2008), increased risk taking (Berger et al., 2013; Brache
& Stockwell, 2011; Peacock, Droste, Pennay, Lubman et al., 2015;
Woolsey et al., 2010), being involved in verbal and physical aggression
(Miller, Quigley, Elisio‐Arras, & Ball, 2016), experiencing negative behav-
ioral outcomes such as fighting (Holubcikova et al., 2016), and nonviolent
alcohol‐related injury (Coomber et al., 2017).
AMED consumption has been associated with being involved in
high‐risk traffic behaviors, such as driving after drinking (O'Brien et al.,
2008; Peacock, Droste, Pennay, Lubman et al., 2015; Woolsey et al.,
2010), speeding, not wearing a seatbelt, traveling with an intoxicated
driver (Eckschmidt et al., 2013), riding with a driver that has used alcohol
(Flotta et al., 2014), receiving driving tickets and warnings (Martz et al.,
2015), and having traffic accidents (Martz et al., 2015). Finally, AMED
consumption has been associated with recent (but not former) trau-
matic brain injuries among Canadian adolescents (Ilie et al., 2015),
experiencing depressive symptoms (Bonar et al., 2017), and increased
risk for suicidal behaviors among U.S. army personnel (Herberman Mash
et al., 2014).
Other studies however, have not found significant associations
between AMED consumption and problematic behaviors including
binge drinking (Flotta et al., 2014), higher intoxication levels (Droste,
Miller, Pennay, Zinkiewicz, & Lubman, 2016; Rossheim and Thombs,
2011), increased levels of sensation seeking (Snipes et al., 2015), being
male (Malinauskas et al., 2007; Reid et al., 2015), younger age (Flotta
et al., 2014), having a lower grade point average (Azagba et al., 2013;
Patrick et al., 2016), school type (Martz et al., 2015), education level
(Pennay et al., 2015), income (Pennay et al., 2015), general health
(Pennay et al., 2015), sleep problems (Bonar et al., 2017), smoking
(Pennay et al., 2015), and nonmedical use of opioids and anxiolytics
(Khan et al., 2016). Further studies have also reported no significant
associations between AMED consumption and drunk driving (Arria
et al., 2016; Berger et al., 2013; Curtis et al., 2016; Flotta et al.,
2014), wearing a seatbelt when riding in a car driven by someone else
(Flotta et al., 2014), being hurt or injured (Berger et al., 2013), race or
ethnic group (Patrick et al., 2016; Wells et al., 2013), sexual identity
(Wells et al., 2013), participation in unprotected sex (Miller, 2012),
unwanted sexual contact (Berger et al., 2013), and sexual victimization
in women (Snipes et al., 2014).

Between‐group comparisons: AMED versus AO
consumers
Woolsey, Williams, et al. (2015) compared alcohol consumption in 281
AO consumers with 268 AMED consumers. The authors found that
the AMED group reported significantly more past month drinking days,
consumed significantly more alcohol on both typical and heaviest past
year drinking occasions, and consumed alcohol for longer times during
these occasions. They further reported that AMED consumers were
significantly more often involved in driving a car while having a
BAC > 0.08%, driving after drinking too much to drive safely, and riding
as a passenger with someone who had consumed too much alcohol to
drive safely. Unfortunately, there was no assessment of whether these
occasions were AMED or AO occasions. In a second study, Woolsey,
Jacobson, et al. (2015) reported similar findings. AMED consumers
were significantly more likely to drive a car while having a BAC > 0.08%,
driving after knowing they were too drunk to drive safely, and being a
passenger of someone who consumed too much alcohol to drive
safely. Again, it was not reported whether these events occurred dur-
ing AMED or AO consumption occasions. Only 13% of AMED con-
sumers reported feeling more capable to drive on AMED occasions
when compared to AO occasions. The fact that the vast majority of
drivers do not report a difference in the capability to drive a car after
AMED or AO is in line with Woolsey's findings that only a minority
of AMED consumers report that after AMED they feel more confident
(36%), feel they could drink more alcohol (45%), felt energy drinks
reduced the negative effects of alcohol (25%), or felt that energy drinks
sober them up quicker (20%). Of note, studies using within‐subject
comparisons among AMED consumers show that driving while intoxi-
cated is significantly less frequently reported for AMED occasions
when compared to AO occasions (De Haan et al., 2012; Johnson,
Alford, Stewart, et al. (2016).
Tucker, Troxel, Ewing, and D'Amico (2016) surveyed 696 U.S. high
school students at the age of 14 and again at age 17. Only those that
reported consuming alcohol were included in the sample. About 13%
reported past month AMED consumption, and these students also
reported consuming more alcohol (both frequency and quantity).
AMED consumption was associated with having more negative conse-
quences at high school, poorer grades, delinquent behavior, substance

 use‐related unsafe driving, drug use, and being intoxicated in public.
No significant differences in mental health, social functioning, and aca-
demic aspirations were found among AMED‐consuming high school
students compared to AO‐consuming high school students.

Are there different types of AMED consumers?
In an effort to examine whether all AMED consumers have similar
characteristics, several studies have subdivided users into different
categories.
Peacock and Bruno (2015) divided 403 young Australian AMED
consumers
into
groups
of
low‐risk‐taking
consumers
(38%),
disinhibited intake consumers (48%), and high‐risk‐taking consumers
(14%). When comparing the three groups, the disinhibited intake and
high‐risk‐taking AMED consumers exhibited higher trait impulsivity
scores and were also more commonly male and had greater AMED
and alcohol consumption. The authors concluded that AMED con-
sumers are not a homogenous group. An alternative interpretation is
that the authors arbitrarily divided AMED consumers into three groups
according to their level of risk‐taking behavior. Without similar com-
parisons in other alcohol consumer groups, it is questionable whether
this study informs understanding of the characteristics of AMED con-
sumers, and therefore, further research is needed in this area.
Other research categorized AMED consumers according to their
motives for AMED consumption.
Varvil‐Weld, Marzell, Turrisi, Mallett, and Cleveland (2013) divided
387 U.S. young AMED consumers into groups of “occasional AMED
consumers” (53.7%), “anti‐AMED” (30.5%), “pro‐AMED” (5.2%), and
“strong peer influence” (10.6%) drinkers. Whereas occasional drinkers
had neutral motives with regard to AMED consumption, pro‐AMED
consumers had positive attitudes and neutral expectancies but
reported the most AMED use, AO consumption, and alcohol‐related
consequences. Again, without comparison to similarly categorized
(for example) AO users, it is unclear to what extent this subdivision
adds to the understanding of characteristics of AMED consumers com-
pared to AO consumers.
Mallett, Marzell, Scaglione, Hultgren, and Turrisi (2014) divided 195
AMED consumers into four groups of “moderate alcohol consumers
with low AMED consumption” (55.9%), “moderate alcohol consumers
with high AMED consumption” (10.8%), “heavy drinkers with low
AMED consumption” (24.6%), or “heavy drinkers with high AMED con-
sumption” (8.7%). They found that drinkers who consume more AMED
have more positive beliefs, expectancies, and attitudes towards AMED
consumption. They further observed that heavy drinkers experienced
more alcohol‐related consequences when compared to moderate
drinkers. Heavy drinkers were 3 times more likely to consume low levels
of AMED than high levels of AMED. In subsequent analyses, Mallett,
Scaglione, Reavy, and Turrisi (2015) divided student drinkers in (a)
nonusers (60.4%), (b) those who initiated AMED consumption (12.4%),
(c) those who discontinued AMED consumption (15.6%), and (d) contin-
uous users of AMED (11.6%). Nonusers reported the lowest alcohol
consumption and alcohol‐related consequences, whereas continuous
users of AMED reported the highest rates. AMED consumers and those
who initiate AMED consumption also engage in riskier drinking behav-
iors and experience higher rates of negative consequences.

Does AMED consumption increase alcohol
consumption?
Table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of studies that investigated
energy drink and alcohol consumption. Data were typically gathered by
survey or interview. Two types of study design have been used—the
chosen design has significant implications regarding study outcome,
conclusions, and theoretical underpinnings. First, studies that used
between‐group comparisons are discussed. In these studies, alcohol
consumption of AMED consumers is compared to alcohol consumption
of AO consumers. By definition, these studies show whether there is a
group difference in alcohol consumption between AMED and AO con-
sumers. If these groups differ fundamentally only on their AMED con-
sumption status as an independent variable, then one can imply
causality—that is, that AMED consumption is wholly or largely responsi-
ble for differences in any dependent variable (i.e., alcohol consumption).
On the other hand, if the AMED and AO groups also differ on some
other fundamental variables (e.g., gender, age, and personality traits),
clearly any group differences may be attributable to this other factor.
A second approach is to use a within‐subjects design, as AMED con-
sumers do not mix alcohol with energy drink on every drinking occasion.
This allows comparison of outcomes between AMED and AO occasions.
The advantage of this design is that the same individuals are investigated
on two occasions thus abolishing the potential, underlying group differ-
ence effects. In theory, the only main difference between the two drinking
occasions would be the co‐consumption of energy drinks. On the other
hand, given that even within AMED consumers the frequency where
drinking episodes include AMED is significantly lower than AO occasions
(e.g., De Haan et al., 2012; Johnson, Alford, Stewart, et al., 2016), it is pos-
sible that consequences associated with AMED consumption have less
salience, skewing remembered instances towards AO occasions.
For the meta‐analyses, studies were included only if they provided
sufficient data regarding the typical number of alcoholic drinks on a
single drinking occasion. Therefore, not all studies could be included.
For example, Penning, de Haan, and Verster (2011) examined alco-
hol consumption on a heavy drinking occasion that resulted in a hang-
over. This drinking occasion cannot be considered to be representative
for a typical (average) drinking episode, nor is it sure this was their past
month heaviest drinking occasion. Therefore, it was excluded from the
meta‐analysis. Also, the on‐premise studies by Lubman, Droste,
Pennay, Hyder, and Miller (2014) and Verster, Benjaminsen, van Lanen,
van Stavel, and Olivier (2015) were excluded from the analyses as it is
not known whether the on‐premise night represents a typical drinking
episode.
The other 11 studies were included in the meta‐analyses.

Between‐group comparisons: AMED versus AO
consumers
Combined, the 11 studies provided data on alcohol consumption on
typical single drinking occasions of 6,061 AMED consumers and
14,496 AO consumers (Brache & Stockwell, 2011; De Haan et al.,
2012; Eckschmidt et al., 2013; Johnson, Alford, Stewart, et al., 2016;

 The results of the meta‐analysis on between‐group comparisons
confirmed that AMED consumers drink significantly more alcohol than
AO consumers on a typical drinking occasion (p = .0001, ES = 0.535,
95% CI [0.378, 0.692]; see Figure 1).
Seven studies also examined the maximum number of alcoholic drinks
consumed on a single occasion during the past month (Brache & Stockwell,
2011; De Haan et al., 2012; Johnson, Alford, Stewart, et al., 2016; O'Brien
et al., 2008; Woolsey et al., 2010; Woolsey, Jacobson, et al., 2015;
Woolsey, Williams, et al., 2015). The meta‐analysis combined data from
between‐group comparisons of 3,301 AMED consumers and 7,167 AO
consumers. AMED consumers reported a significantly higher maximum
number of alcoholic drinks consumed on a single past month occasion
when compared to AO consumers (p = .0001, ES = 0.651, 95% CI
[0.496, 0.807]; see Figure 2).
3.4.2

Within‐subject comparisons: AMED versus AO
occasions
Eight studies used a within‐subject design to compare alcohol con-
sumption on a typical AMED and a typical AO occasion (Brache &
Stockwell, 2011; De Haan et al., 2012; Johnson, Alford, Stewart,
et al., 2016; Lubman et al., 2013; Peacock, Bruno, & Martin, 2012;
Price, Hilchey, Darredeau, Fulton, & Barrett, 2016 Verster et al.,
2014; Woolsey et al., 2010). Alcohol intake of 3,480 AMED consumers
was compared for both occasions. Figure 3 summarizes the results of
the meta‐analysis. Alcohol consumption of AMED consumers does
not significantly differ on typical AMED occasions when compared to
typical AO occasions (p = .170, ES = −0.095, 95% CI [−0.230, 0.041]).
Four studies collected data on the maximum number of alcoholic
drinks consumed on a single episode during the past month (De Haan
et al., 2012; Johnson, Alford, Stewart, et al., 2016; Lubman et al., 2013;
Woolsey et al., 2010). Data from 2,743 AMED consumers were com-
bined into the meta‐analysis. The analysis revealed that for the maxi-
mum number of alcoholic drinks consumed on a single occasion
during the past month, the total alcohol consumption on AMED occa-
sions was significantly lower than on AO occasions (p = .015,
ES = −0.577, 95% CI [−1.039, −0.114]; see Figure 4).
3.4.3

Prospective studies
Marzell et al., 2014 conducted a survey in 386 U.S. students followed
up 1 year thereafter. AMED consumers reported significantly higher
amounts of alcohol consumption and associated negative sexual,
academic,
and
physical
consequences
when
compared
to

 consumption in the first survey predicted the behaviors observed in
the follow‐up survey.
Patrick, Evans‐Polce, & Maggs, 2014 conducted a prospective
study to examine whether AMED consumption predicted alcohol‐
related consequences 2 years later. They found that AMED consump-
tion was associated with significantly increased AUDIT scores, greater
alcohol intake, and corresponding negative consequences. In a second
paper, 508 AMED consumers were followed for 56 days (Patrick &
Maggs, 2014). Within‐subjects, occasions of AMED consumption were
compared to AO occasions. The analyses revealed that on AMED occa-
sions significantly more alcohol was consumed. Interpretation is diffi-
cult as no data were presented regarding estimated or measured
amounts of alcohol consumed on AMED and AO occasions, nor on
the relative frequency of both types of drinking occasions. After
controlling for estimated BAC, no significant differences in subjective
intoxication were found.

Comparisons of energy drink with other mixers
To examine whether energy drinks have unique properties relative to
other nonalcoholic mixers such as cola and tonic, direct comparisons
were made in two studies.
In the Netherlands, Verster et al. (2014) compared alcohol
consumption of 1,239 AMED consumers on occasions when they con-
sumed AMED with occasions when they mixed alcohol with other
nonalcoholic beverages (AMOB). Overall, the motives for consuming
AMED and AMOB were similar. Although significantly more often sub-
jects endorsed negative motives for AMOB compared to AMED, neg-
ative motives were endorsed only by a small number of subjects.
Therefore, the relevance of these differences can be questioned. Alco-
hol consumption on a typical AMED occasion (5.4 alcoholic drinks) was
significantly higher than alcohol on a typical AMOB occasion (5.1 alco-
holic drinks), representing a difference of 0.3 drinks per occasion.
Regarding the past month greatest number of drinks on a single drink-
ing occasion, significantly less alcohol was consumed on the AMED
occasion (4.5 alcoholic drinks) when compared to the AMOB occasion
(5.4 alcoholic drinks).
This study also attempted to differentiate between neutral and
negative motives. Within‐subject analyses were conducted to compare
alcohol consumption (quantity and frequency) on AMED occasions and
AO occasions. Alcohol consumption of AMED consumers with neutral
motives was compared to alcohol consumption of those who reported
at least one negative motive (the latter comprising 21% of the sample
[n = 257]). Irrespective of their motives, both groups reported consum-
ing significantly less alcohol on occasions when they consumed AMED
compared to AO occasions and to occasions when consuming alcohol
mixed with other nonalcoholic beverages.
Johnson, Alford, Stewart, et al. (2016) performed a partial replica-
tion of the Dutch study in 732 U.K. AMED consumers. Significantly
more subjects reported consuming AMED “to celebrate a special

 occasion” and “to get drunk” because they “received the drink from
someone else” or “because others drink it as well”. However, signifi-
cantly fewer subjects reported consuming AMED compared to AMOB
because “It feels like I can drink more alcohol.” Alcohol consumption
was significantly lower on typical AMED occasions (6.1 alcoholic
drinks) compared to typical AMOB occasions (6.7 alcoholic drinks).
Regarding the past month greatest number of drinks on a single drink-
ing occasion, significantly less alcohol was consumed on the AMED
occasion (7.1 alcoholic drinks) when compared to the AMOB occasion
(8.3 alcoholic drinks).
In both the U.K. and Dutch studies, irrespective of the type of mixer,
on both AMED and AMOB occasions, total alcohol consumption was
significantly less when compared to AO occasions of the same subjects.
Taken together, results from these two large studies suggest that
most alcohol is consumed on AO occasions. Significantly less alcohol is
consumed on mixing occasions. However, the type of nonalcoholic
mixerhaslittleinfluenceonthetotalamountofalcoholthatisconsumed.
Cobb et al. (2015) also reported data from a between‐group com-
parison regarding alcohol consumption of those who (a) consume
premixed AMED drinks, (b) consume self‐mixed AMED drinks, and (c)
mix other nonalcoholic caffeinated beverages with alcohol. The analy-
ses revealed that those who consume premixed AMED drinks con-
sumed significantly more standard drinks but were engaged in mixing
caffeine and alcohol for significantly fewer months than the other
two groups. No significant differences we observed with regard to
the average number of past month drinking days of alcohol mixed with
caffeine, hours spent drinking alcohol on a typical night mixing alcohol
with caffeine, average number of days of alcohol consumption per
month (without caffeine), or the average alcohol quantity consumed.
Unfortunately no AO group was included. Also of note, in the United
States premixed AMED drinks are no longer marketed.

The desire to drink more alcohol
Four studies have examined the desire to drink more alcohol after con-
suming AMED or AO.
Marczinski, Fillmore, Henges, Ramsey, and Young (2013) reported
that consumption of AMED increased the motivation to consume
more alcohol when compared to AO consumption. However, the
observed difference between AMED and AO group was not statisti-
cally significant (p = .075). Similarly, no significant differences were
observed in ratings of sedation.
McKetin and Coen (2014) compared a group who consumed
AMED with a group who consumed AO. They administered to each
subject 60 ml of vodka, mixed with either Red Bull Silver Edition
(AMED group, N = 36) or soda (AO group, N = 39). As body weight
and gender were not taken into account, the AO group had a signifi-
cantly higher breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) when compared to
the AMED group (0.030% vs. 0.025%, p = .042). No significant differ-
ences between the groups were found for ratings of stimulation, seda-
tion, feeling the effects of the cocktail, or feeling high. The group that
received Red Bull as the mixer reported significantly higher scores of
wanting more of the cocktail than those who received soda as mixer
(a difference of 17 mm on the 100‐mm scale, p = .006).
Marczinski, Fillmore, Stamates, and Maloney (2016) conducted a
six‐way crossover study in 26 healthy young subjects examining the
desire to drink more alcohol after administering alcohol (1.21 ml/kg
vodka) or placebo, mixed with different dosages of energy drink
(3.63 or 6.05 ml/kg, i.e., one or two 80‐ml cans of Red Bull for a 70‐
kg person) or placebo, alone or in combination. Twenty minutes after
drinking, the desire to drink more alcohol after receiving a low or high
AMED dose was significantly higher when compared to the AO condi-
tion (p = .032). A transitory statistically significant increase from a
score of 23.8 (AO) to 34.5 (AMED) on a 100‐point desire scale was
observed 20 min after consumption, but the effect was not significant
10, 40, 60, and 80 min after beverage consumption.
Marczinski, Fillmore, Maloney, and Stamates (2017) examined the
rate of drinking AMED versus AO. In a crossover design, 16 subjects
consumed (a) 1.97 ml/kg vodka and 5.91 ml/kg decaffeinated soft
drink, (b) 1.97 ml/kg vodka and 5.91 ml/kg energy drink, (c) 5.91 ml/
kg decaffeinated soft drink, or (d) 5.91 ml/kg energy drink. The drinks
were divided into 10 cups, and subjects were told that they had 2 hr to
consume the beverages. The mean BrAC achieved after 2 hr was
0.066%. No significant differences were observed on ratings of stimu-
lation or sedation, nor between the AMED and AO condition on a cued
go/no‐go task. The AMED beverage was consumed significantly faster
(i.e., 16 min) than the AO beverage.
It should be taken into account that the urge or desire to drink
does not automatically imply that this results in greater alcohol intake.
For example, in a recent study, participants could choose their
preferred beverage of choice, and the subsequent number of self‐
administered drinks were recorded (Sweeney, Meredith, Evatt, &
Griffiths, 2017). The alcoholic drinks each contained 14 g alcohol, with
added caffeine (60 mg) or placebo. Quinine was added to mask the
bitter taste of caffeine. Sixty‐five percent of participants choose to
consume the caffeinated alcoholic beverage above the AO beverage.
However, no significant difference was observed in the number of
self‐administered drinks.

Does mixing alcohol with energy drink change
the drinker's perception of intoxication?
It has been hypothesized that the stimulant effects of caffeine may
counteract the depressant effects of alcohol. In other words, that co‐
consumption of energy drinks may mask the intoxication effects of
alcohol. The masking effect implies that drinkers would feel less intox-
icated than they actually are when they consume AMED. The presence
of a masking effect could have serious consequences, for example,
when considering driving. People who are objectively intoxicated
could perceive themselves as being less intoxicated or even sober
and thus would be more willing to drive a car. This example illustrates
the importance of research to determine whether such a masking
effect actually exists after coconsumption of energy drinks and alcohol.
The most frequently cited study to support the existence of a
masking was conducted by Ferreira, de Mello, Pompéia, and de
Souza‐Formigoni (2006). However, the study by Ferreira et al. did
not directly assess subjective intoxication. Instead, it assessed 18
symptoms of alcohol consumption and reported significant differences
on subjective assessments of four of these symptoms. It can be

 questioned to what extent these four symptoms (i.e., higher scores of
headache, weakness, salivation, and reduced motor coordination) are
related to subjective intoxication and masking. Of note, Ferreira's find-
ings were not confirmed in a recent replication study with twice the
number of subjects (Ulbrich et al., 2013). In this study, Ulbrich et al.
(2013) found no significant difference on any of the 18 symptoms that
were examined by Ferreira et al. (2006). Similarly, Alford, Hamilton‐
Morris, and Verster (2012) could not find significant differences in sub-
jective effects to support the findings of Ferreira et al.
In 2014, Benson, Verster, Alford, and Scholey (2014) conducted a
literature review and meta‐analysis on the effects of consuming alco-
hol mixed with caffeinated beverages on subjective intoxication. Six-
teen articles were summarized, and nine were included in the meta‐
analysis. In addition to studies that combined alcohol with energy drink,
also clinical trials examining the effects of alcohol with caffeine (e.g.,
powder) or other nonalcoholic caffeinated beverages were included (e.
g., colas or caffeinated beer). One study included two doses of caffeine
in a within‐subjects design (Marczinski and Fillmore, 2006). The meta‐
analyses by Benson et al. (2014) revealed that no significant masking
effect was found with the higher or lower caffeine level (p = .404 and
.406, respectively). The authors concluded that
Despite the large range of caffeine doses (2.0–5.5 mg/kg
resulting in absolute levels of 46–383 mg) and alcohol
levels
0.29–1.068
g/kg
(resulting
in
blood
alcohol
concentration (BAC) from 0.032 to 0.12%) investigated,
caffeine had no effect on the judgement of subjective
intoxication.
This conclusion was adopted in 2015 by the European Food
Safety Authority (2015) who referred to this review in their assess-
ment on the safety of caffeine and concluded that “Single doses of caf-
feine up to 200 mg, corresponding to about 3 mg/kg bw for a 70‐kg
adult are unlikely to […] mask the subjective perception of alcohol
intoxication.”

Masking studies: AMED versus AO
Data on the masking effect examined when combining alcohol with
actual energy drinks (rather than with caffeine or cola‐type drinks)
come from six experimental studies directly comparing subjective
intoxication after consuming AMED with AO (Benson & Scholey,
2014; Marczinski, Fillmore, Bardgett, & Howard, 2011; Marczinski, Fill-
more, Henges, Ramsey, & Young, 2012; Marczinski et al., 2013;
Peacock, Bruno, Martin, & Carr, 2013; Van de Loo et al., 2016). In addi-
tion, an on‐premise study was conducted in the Netherlands assessing
subjective intoxication in a natural setting, including higher consump-
tion levels of alcohol when compared to laboratory settings. These
studies are summarized in Table 2.
In the six experimental studies, alcohol was consumed to achieve a
peak BrAC ranging from 0.03% to 0.08% (i.e., the equivalent of one to
four alcoholic drinks). Coadministered caffeine levels that varied from
0.6 to 3.57 mg/kg bodyweight (i.e., the equivalent of 0.5 to three
250‐ml cans of an 80‐mg‐caffeine energy drink). Subjective intoxica-
tion was assessed using the Beverage Rating Scale (Marczinski et al.,
2011, 2012, 2013; Peacock et al., 2013) or visual analogue scales

 ranging from sober to drunk/highly intoxicated (Benson & Scholey,
2014; Van de Loo et al., 2016). On the Beverage Rating Scale, drinkers
rate their perceived intoxication in terms of equivalence to that felt
after consuming bottles of beer containing 5% alcohol. The scale
ranges from 0 to 10 bottles of beer, in 0.5‐bottle increments.
Marczinski et al. (2011, 2012, 2013) conducted three studies in
healthy volunteers that examined the effect of AMED consumption
on subjective intoxication. In the first study, subjective intoxication
was assessed after administering 0.65 g/kg alcohol to achieve a peak
BAC of approximately 0.08%, with or without 3.57 ml/kg energy drink
(equivalent to 1.14 mg/kg caffeine, that is, a 250‐ml can containing
80 mg caffeine for a 70‐kg person). No significant difference in subjec-
tive intoxication was found between the group that consumed AMED
and the group that consumed AO (Marczinski et al., 2011). In the sec-
ond study, Maczinski et al. (2012) administered less alcohol (to achieve
a peak BAC of approximately 0.065%) while administering the same
amount of energy drink as in the first study. Again, no significant differ-
ence in subjective intoxication was found between AMED and AO
consumers. In the third study, Marczinski et al. (2013) administered
0.29 g/kg alcohol to reach a peak BAC of approximately 0.03%. In this
study, 1.82 ml/kg energy drink (0.6 mg/kg caffeine) was administered
(equivalent to half a 250‐ml can containing 80 mg caffeine for a 70‐
kg person). Also, in this study, no significant difference in subjective
intoxication was observed between the group that consumed AMED
and the AO group.
In N = 28 healthy subjects, and Peacock, Bruno, Martin, and Carr
(2013) examined subjective intoxication after administering alcohol
(0.5 g/kg), AMED (3.57 ml/kg), or a placebo drink. Subjective intoxica-
tion was assessed with the Beverage Rating Scale and a 100‐mm visual
analogue scale (the subjective effects scale). Both scales showed that
alcohol alone significantly increased subjective intoxication ratings.
Coadministering energy drink did not significantly alter these ratings.
Similarly, the observed physiological and psychological side effects in
this study must be attributed to the independent effects of alcohol
or energy drink alone; interactions between the two were generally
absent (Peacock, Bruno, Martin, & Carr, 2014).
In a crossover design in N = 24 healthy subjects, Benson and
Scholey (2014) examined subjective intoxication after administering
alcohol (0.6 g/kg), alcohol mixed with 250 ml Red Bull energy drink
(80 mg caffeine), or a placebo drink (matched except for functional
ingredients). Subjective intoxication was assessed with a 100‐mm
visual analogue scale ranging from sober to drunk. Consumption of
alcohol alone and AMED both significantly increased subjective intox-
ication ratings. No significant differences were observed in subjective
intoxication ratings between the alcohol alone and AMED condition.
Van de Loo et al. (2016) examined the effects of energy drink
(250 ml Red Bull, 80 mg caffeine) versus placebo energy drink mixed
with alcohol to achieve a BrAC of 0.08%, 0.05%, 0.02%, and 0%.
Subjective intoxication was assessed on a scale ranging from 0 (sober)
to 10 (highly intoxicated). Fifty‐six healthy social drinkers participated
in this double‐blind study. No significant difference in subjective intox-
ication was observed at BAC 0.08% and 0.05%. At BAC 0.02%, a
significant difference was found between energy drink and the placebo
drink (0.93 vs. 0.61, respectively, on a range from 0 to 10), with the low

confirmed that also at higher BAC levels no evidence of a masking

The meta‐analysis of six studies that examined subjective

Higher dosages on premise
In the Netherlands, Verster et al. (2015) assessed subjective intoxica-
tion on‐premise in 997 people leaving the bar after an evening of alco-
hol consumption. Breath alcohol tests were conducted followed by a
short interview. One hundred eighty‐five subjects consumed alcohol
and energy drink on the night of the interview. Both objective intoxica-
tion (BrAC 0.074%) and subjective intoxication did not significantly
differ between those who consumed AO and those who consumed
AMED. Regression analyses revealed that gender, time of the inter-
view, and BrAC were significant predictors of subjective intoxication
and

explained
37.7%
of
variance.

coconsumed energy drink or not was unrelated to subjective intoxica-
tion levels. This study showed that also under real‐life circumstances,
including achieving higher BrACs when compared to the six controlled
laboratory experiments, no evidence was found for the existence of a
so‐called masking effect.

Does AMED consumption affect risk‐taking
behavior?
A number of studies showed that AMED consumers experience signif-
icantly more risk‐taking behaviors when compared to AO consumers
(see section on characteristics of AMED consumers for an overview).
As stated earlier, these associations do not necessarily reflect a causal
relationship with AMED consumption, as energy drinks may simply
appeal more to people with higher levels of risk‐taking behavior than
does AO consumption. To examine whether there is a direct relation-
ship between AMED consumption and risk taking, studies applying a
within‐subject design are needed. Up to now, four studies have used
such a design.
Peacock
et
al.
(2012)

AMED
consumers. Relative to AO occasions, on AMED occasions the rates
of engagement in 26 different alcohol‐related risk‐taking behaviors
were significantly lower. In a subsequent placebo controlled double‐
blind clinical trial in 28 healthy subjects, no significant difference in
risk‐taking behavior was observed on the Balloon Analogue Risk Task
after administering alcohol (0.5 g/kg body weight) and energy drink
(3.57 ml/kg body weight Red Bull) or alcohol mixed with placebo
energy drink.
Similar findings of reduced chances of engaging in risk‐taking
behavior on AMED occasions compared to AO occasions were found
among 1,239 Dutch AMED consumers (De Haan et al., 2012) and
732 AMED consumers from the United Kingdom (Johnson, Alford,
Verster, et al., 2016).
It has been argued that risk‐taking behavior may be less commonly
experienced or remembered on AMED occasions simply because
AMED occasions occur significantly less frequently than AO occasions.
Therefore, Peacock, Droste, Pennay, Lubman et al., 2015 examined a
sample of 273 Australian and New Zealand AMED consumers with
matched frequencies of AMED and AO occasions. Again, significantly
lower odds of 18 out of 25 risk‐taking behaviors were found for AMED
occasions. No significant difference was found for the other seven
risk‐taking behaviors that were assessed.

DISCUSSION
This review of the literature shows that, compared with alcohol alone,
mixing alcohol with energy drink has little significant effect on total
alcohol consumption, subjective intoxication, and alcohol‐associated
risk‐taking behavior or other negative consequences. Alcohol itself
seems to be the cause of many negative consequences of high alcohol
intake per se. The literature is overwhelmingly consistent with the
notion that AMED consumption is just one manifestation of an under-
lying trait for greater alcohol consumption along with a cluster of other
risky behaviors.
4.1
|
Prevalence of AMED consumption
In our previous review (Verster et al., 2012), we noted that studies
reported percentages of AMED consumption ranging from 6% to
44%. These figures have not significantly changed over the past
5 years. Sample size, and the extent of targeted recruitment, and
geographical and demographic variables likely all contribute to the
large disparity in prevalence. Data from the few studies that have used
truly random sampling suggest that the prevalence of AMED consump-
tion in the general population is at or below 5% (e.g., Pennay et al.,
2015).
4.2
|
Motives for AMED consumption
The most frequently reported motives for AMED consumption are
neutral motives such as “I like the taste.” Negative motives such as
“To drink more and not feel as drunk” are less frequently reported.
Additionally, the subdivision into neutral and negative motives is
straightforward for some items; for others, it can be problematic. For
example, “I like the taste” may be considered a neutral motive. How-
ever, if those who endorse this motive engage in a significant increase
in alcohol consumption, then it could also be considered a negative
one. On the other hand, the different motives for AMED consumption
appear unrelated to total alcohol consumption on AMED versus AO
occasions.
4.3

Characteristics of AMED consumers
A large number of studies presented associations with AMED con-
sumption. These studies should be interpreted with some caution. A
significant association should not necessarily imply causal relationships
with AMED consumption. Any association may be driven by some
third factor. Alternatively, there may be reverse causation. For exam-
ple, Rossheim et al. (2016) suggested that the association between
heavy drinking and being an AMED consumer should be interpreted
in an alternative way; that is, the more alcohol you consume, the more
likely you also consume an AMED drink. They found a significant asso-
ciation between total alcohol consumption and the number of different
types of alcohol consumed.
Between‐group comparisons illustrate that AMED consumers may
differ in a cluster of characteristics from those who consume AO. For
example, several studies showed that AMED consumers drink more
alcohol than those who consume AO. One interpretation is that this
is caused by the coconsumption of energy drinks. However, there are
other possible explanations. For example, AMED consumers show
higher scores on sensation seeking and express more risk‐taking
behavior than AO consumers. An alternative interpretation is that
AMED consumption is one of a cluster of behaviors expressed by some
underlying trait or phenotype. In fact, the within‐subject comparisons
show that AMED consumers do not drink more alcohol on AMED
occasions when compared to AO occasions (see Figure 3 and 4).
Thus, the observed differences between AMED and AO con-
sumers seem to be presently independent of the consumption of
AMED. In other words, the groups may already differ from each other
in many respects, and AMED consumption is just one of them. The
available data further show that associations that are found in one
study may be absent in other studies. This observation illustrates that
the occurrence of significant associations depends highly on the char-
acteristics of the sample under investigation. One reason for the
conflicting results is that most cross‐sectional studies included rela-
tively small convenience samples of students. It is unclear to what
VERSTER ET AL.
15 of 19
 extent these samples are representative for the whole student popula-
tion, whether they are nationally representative, or how the results
translate to other countries.

Overall alcohol consumption, subjective
intoxication, and associated risk‐taking behavior
The meta‐analysis revealed that among AMED consumers, alcohol
consumption is not significantly higher on typical AMED occasions
when compared to typical AO occasions. Moreover, for the heaviest
drinking occasion during the past month, it was shown that AMED
consumers drink significantly less alcohol on AMED occasions when
compared to AO occasions (see Figures 3 and 4).
When consuming the same amount of alcohol, mixed with energy
drink or placebo, experimental studies and on‐premise data showed no
evidence of the existence of a “masking effect.” This finding is in line
with those from studies examining mixing alcohol with caffeine
(Benson et al. (2014). Across various alcohol and caffeine concentra-
tions, no significant difference was found in subjective intoxication
scores on AMED and AO occasions.
Within‐subject comparisons show that on AMED occasions,
significantly less risk‐taking behavior and negative alcohol‐related
consequences were experienced when compared to AO occasions.
Higher levels of risk‐taking behavior seem to be a preexisting charac-
teristic of people that also engage in energy drink consumption. The
meta‐analyses show that significantly less alcohol is consumed on
heaviest drinking AMED occasions when compared to heaviest drink-
ing AO occasions. As the relationship between alcohol consumption
and risk taking per se has been established, this finding may also
explain why less risk taking is experienced on AMED occasions when
compared to AO occasions.
In conclusion, current evidence suggests that mixing alcohol with
energy drink does not increase overall alcohol consumption and asso-
ciated risk‐taking behavior, nor does it have an effect on subjective
intoxication. The data do, however, show that excessive alcohol
consumption is common among certain populations (e.g., students).
The latter deserves attention, and we fully support the notion by
authorities such as National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism
(NIAAA) that future research should focus on the causes, conse-
quences, and prevention of excessive alcohol consumption per se.
