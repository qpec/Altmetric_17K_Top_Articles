IMPORTANCE Pubic hair grooming is a common practice that can lead to injury and morbidity.
OBJECTIVE To identify demographic and behavioral risk factors associated with pubic hair
grooming–related injuries to characterize individuals with high risk of injury and develop
recommendations for safe grooming practices.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study conducted a national survey
of noninstitutionalized US adults (aged 18-65 years). The web-based survey was conducted
through a probability-based web panel designed to be representative of the US population.
Data were collected in January 2014 and analyzed from August 1, 2016, through February 1,
2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Grooming-related injury history (yes or no), high-frequency
injuries (>5 lifetime injuries), and injury requiring medical attention.
RESULTS Among the 7570 participants who completed the survey (4198 men [55.5%] and
3372 women [44.5%]; mean (SD) age, 41.9 [18.9] years), 5674 of 7456 (76.1%) reported a
history of grooming (66.5% of men and 85.3% of women [weighted percentages]).
Grooming-related injury was reported by 1430 groomers (weighted prevalence, 25.6%), with
more women sustaining an injury than men (868 [27.1%] vs 562 [23.7%]; P = .01). Laceration
was the most common injury sustained (818 [61.2%]), followed by burn (307 [23.0%]) and
rashes (163 [12.2%]). Common areas for grooming-related injury for men were the scrotum
(378 [67.2%]), penis (196 [34.8%]), and pubis (162 [28.9%]); for women, the pubis (445
[51.3%]), inner thigh (340 [44.9%]), labia majora (369 [42.5%]), and perineum (115 [13.2%]).
After adjustment for age, duration of grooming, hairiness, instrument used, and grooming
frequency, men who removed all their pubic hair 11 times or more during their lifespan had an
increased risk for grooming injury (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.97; 95% CI, 1.28-3.01;
P = .002) and were prone to repeated high-frequency injuries (AOR, 3.89; 95% CI, 2.01-7.52;
P < .001) compared with groomers who did not remove all their pubic hair. Women who
removed all their pubic hair 11 times or more had increased odds of injury (AOR, 2.21; 95% CI,
1.53-3.19; P < .001) and high-frequency injuries (AOR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.78-5.01; P < .001)
compared with groomers who do not remove all their pubic hair. In women, waxing
decreased the odds of high-frequency injuries (AOR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.03-0.43; P = .001)
compared with nonelectric blades. In total, 79 injuries among 5674 groomers (1.4%) required
medical attention.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Grooming frequency and degree of grooming (ie, removing all
pubic hair) are independent risk factors for injury. The present data may help identify
injury-prone groomers and lead to safer grooming practices.

ubichairremovalhasbecomeacommonpracticeamong
menandwomenworldwide.1Thistrendhasbeendriven
in part by the media and in part by modern society’
s
definition of attractiveness, cleanliness, feelings of feminin-
ity or masculinity, and perception of genital normalcy.2-4 Pu-
bic hair removal has been associated with genital self-image
and higher levels of sexual response.5,6 Although pubic hair
grooming is widespread, the risks associated with hair re-
moval, such as genitourinary injuries, remain largely unchar-
acterized.
Injuries during or after pubic hair grooming are minor
(eg, razor or wax burns, folliculitis, and irritation)7,8 and
major (eg, laceration, skin infection, and sepsis).9,10 In a pre-
vious study describing injuries sustained while grooming
pubic hair, Glass et al11 used emergency department data to
estimate that 12 000 grooming-related injuries occurred
from 2002 to 2010 in the United States, with a 5-fold
increase in injuries during this 9-year period. This trend
suggests an increase in grooming incidence or an increased
rate of injuries sustained while grooming.11 Although that
study was the first to our knowledge to quantify genital
injuries related to grooming, no information was available
in the emergency department database to characterize risk
factors. Furthermore, the study only captured injuries war-
ranting evaluation in an emergency department and thus
likely underestimated the prevalence of all injuries related
to grooming.
Given the high prevalence of pubic hair grooming
(50%-87%),2,3,5,12abetterunderstandingofhowgroomingmay
lead to injury is warranted. We evaluated grooming behavior
by using a survey distributed to a nationally representative
sample of US men and women. Our survey focused on per-
sonal grooming practices and self-reported grooming-related
injuries. We hypothesized that the grooming instrument and
grooming frequency would be associated with injury.
Methods
Study Population
We conducted a nationally representative survey of noninsti-
tutionalized adults (aged 18-65 years) residing in the United
States. We developed a questionnaire examining injuries and
infections that occur as a result of personal grooming. The sur-
vey was conducted with GfK (formerly Knowledge Net-
works). Details regarding GfK study methods have been re-
ported previously10,13,14 and are described below. The
Committee on Human Research at the University of Califor-
nia San Francisco approved the study. GfK obtained elec-
tronic informed consent from all participants before admin-
istering the survey.
Panel members were randomly recruited using address-
based sampling methods from the US Postal Service’
s Deliv-
ery Sequence File.15 After the panel members were recruited,
they received notification via email to participate in a study
sample. GfK provided a laptop or notebook computer and free
internet service to all panel members with limited internet
and/or computer access. For the present study, panel mem-
bers received 1000 points for completing the survey ($1 cash
equivalent). The final survey was distributed in January of
2014.
Assessment of Potential Risk Factors for Grooming-Related
Injuries
The survey instrument can be found in the eAppendix in the
Supplement. Potential risk factors ranged from demographic
to grooming-related characteristics. Demographic character-
istics included age and race (white, black, Hispanic, mixed, or
other). Grooming characteristics included age when groom-
ing of pubic hair started, duration of grooming (in years), self-
perceived degree of hairiness (on a 7-point Likert scale, with
higher scores indicating increased perception of hairiness),
groomingfrequency(daily,weekly,monthly,every3-6months,
every year, or no regular grooming), the instrument used most
often (nonelectric blade, electric razor, wax, scissors, laser hair
removal and/or electrolysis, or other), who performs one’
s
grooming (self, partner or friend, or professional), position of
grooming(squatting,sittingorlayingonback,orstanding),how
grooming was visualized (direct visualization, using a mirror,
and/or without any visualization), and the number of times the
participant removed all their pubic hair (0, 1, 2-5, 6-10, or ≥11
times).
Assessment of Grooming-Related Injuries
To understand grooming-related injuries, we queried respon-
dents on injury history, location, type, and severity. Injury lo-
cation was defined by region; for men, this included the scro-
tum, penis, pubis, inner thigh, perineum, or anus; for women,
the pubis, inner thigh, labia majora, perineum, or anus. In-
jury types were classified as burn, rash, laceration, infection,
and/or abscess, and a serious injury was defined as one that
requiredmedicalattention.Injurieswereclassifiedintothefol-
lowing 3 different variables for analysis: (1) any history of
grooming-related injury (yes or no), (2) history of high-
frequency injuries (≥5 pubic hair grooming injuries over their
lifetimes), and (3) a history of injury that required medical at-
tention (eg, medical care, antibiotics, or surgery).
Statistical Methods
Data were analyzed from August 1, 2016, through February 1,
2017. GfK uses statistical weighting adjustments to correct for
known deviations. Additional survey errors such as noncov-
erage and nonresponse were also corrected for using panel
Key Points
Question What are the prevalence and clinical correlates of
injuries among US adults who groom pubic hair?
Findings In this nationally representative cross-sectional study of
5674 adults who reported pubic hair grooming, grooming-related
injury was reported by 1430 (weighted prevalence, 25.6%).
Degree of grooming was an independent risk factor for injury;
waxing may prevent repetitive injuries.
Meaning The present data may help to identify injury-prone
groomers and lead to safer grooming practices.

Results
Of the 14 409 US men and women who received our survey,
7570 (52.5% overall) completed the survey (4198 men [55.5%]
and 3372 women [44.5%]). The mean age (SD) of respondents
was 41.9 (18.9) years. Among the respondents, 5154 (68.1%)
were white; 951 (12.6%), Hispanic; 928 (12.3%), black; and 273
(7.1%), other.17 Four thousand seven hundred eighty-one re-
spondents (63.2%) were married or living with a partner; 1736
(22.9%), single; 897 (11.8%), divorced or separated; and 156
(2.1%), widowed.
Grooming Behavior
In total, 5674 of 7456 respondents (76.1%) reported ever hav-
ing groomed their pubic hair, with significantly more women
reporting a history of grooming (85.3% [weighted percent-
age]) than men (66.5% [weighted percentage]; P < .001).
Groomersweresignificantlyyoungerthannongroomers(mean
[SD] age, 43.2 [13.0] vs 49.8 [13.0] years; P < .001).
Amongthe5674(76.1%)respondentswhoreportedgroom-
ing, the mean (SD) age at grooming initiation was 23.4 (9.9)
years, with men reporting grooming starting later in life (mean
[SD] age, 25.2 [11.5] vs 22.0 [8.4] years; P < .001) and a corre-
spondingly shorter duration of grooming (15.0 [11.2] vs 18.8
[10.7] years; P < .001) than women. Most groomers (5345
[94.2%]) reported a history of personal hair removal, whereas
482 (8.5%) were groomed by a partner, 221 (3.9%) were
groomed by a professional, and 28 (0.5%) were groomed by a
friend. The most common position that groomers used to re-
move pubic hair was standing (4267 [75.2%]), followed by sit-
ting (1265 [22.3%]), squatting (749 [13.2%]), and lying down
(658 [11.6%]). Most respondents reported grooming under di-
rect visualization (4369 [77.0%]), whereas 1226 (21.6%) used
a mirror and 993 (17.5%) groomed without any visualization
but by feel. The most common methods for removing pubic
hair consisted of a nonelectric razor (2695 [47.5%]), followed
byanelectricrazor(1526[26.9%]),scissors(1044[18.4%]),wax
(148 [2.6%]), and electrolysis and/or laser hair reduction (34
[0.6%]).
Injury Types, Location, and Severity
An injury was reported by 1430 (weighted prevalence, 25.6%)
of all groomers, with more women reporting a history of
injury than men (868 of 3204 [27.1%] vs 562 of 2373 [23.7%];
P = .03). Most injured respondents reported having been in-
jured more than once (51 [66.5%]), with 461 (32.2%) of respon-
dentsreporting5ormoregrooming-relatedinjuriesduringtheir
lifetime.Lacerationwasthemostcommoninjuryreported(818
[61.2%]), followed by burn (307 [23.0%]) and rashes (163
[12.2%]). In addition, 133 injured groomers (9.3%) reported a
history of infection resulting from their injury. Of self-
reported injuries, respondents required antibiotics in 49 cases
(3.4%), and 36 (2.5%) had severe injuries that required surgi-
cal intervention, such as incision and drainage of an abscess
or suture closure of a laceration.

 Figure 1 and Figure 2 depict heatmaps using injury
prevalence to highlight the most commonly reported areas
of injury for male and female groomers. Men reported most
often injuring the scrotum (378 [67.2%]), followed by
the penis (196 [34.8%]) and the pubis (162 [28.9%]). For
women, the most commonly injured site was the pubis (445
[51.3%]), followed by the inner thigh (340 [44.9%]), the
labia majora (369 [42.5%]), perineum (115 [13.2%]), and the
anus (48 [5.5%]).
Risk Factors Associated With Grooming-Related Injuries
Male groomers who reported a grooming-related injury were
younger (mean [SD] age, 36.9 [11.7] vs 41.2 [12.9] years;
P < .001), had initiated grooming earlier in life (mean [SD] age,
22.7 [9.0] vs 26.1 [11.0] years; P < .001), and had groomed for
a slightly shorter time (mean [SD] duration, 14.1 [8.6] vs 15.3
[10.9] years; P = .04) compared with noninjured groomers. Fe-
male groomers who reported a grooming-related injury were
younger (mean [SD] age, 36.4 [11.8] vs 42.5 [13.4] years;
P < .001), had initiated grooming earlier in life (mean [SD] age,
20.1 [7.7] vs 22.7 [9.4] years; P < .001), and had groomed for a
shortertime(mean[SD]duration,16.2[9.8]vs19.8[12.0]years;
P < .001) compared with noninjured groomers. With use of the
Likert scale for self-perceived hairiness, male groomers with
a history of injury perceived themselves to be hairier (mean
[SD] score, 4.2 [1.3] vs 3.9 [1.4]; P = .01) than did noninjured
male groomers. This comparison was not statistically signifi-
cant in female groomers. Male groomers most often had an in-
jury when they performed grooming in the standing position
(487 [86.8%] vs 1470 [82.4%]; P = .03) compared with nonin-
jured male groomers. Position of grooming was not signifi-
cant for female groomers. Removal of all pubic hair was more
common in male and female groomers who reported an in-
jury compared with noninjured groomers (Table 1).
Multivariable Analysis
Five hundred sixty-two men (23.7%) reported a grooming-
related injury. These men had an increased risk for an injury
if they self-perceived to be hairier (adjusted odds ratio
[AOR], 1.14; 95% CI, 1.04-1.26), groomed monthly (AOR,
1.71; 95% CI, 1.11-2.64), groomed every 3 to 6 months
(AOR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.16-2.65), or removed all their hair
more than 11 times (AOR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.28-3.01) compared
with nongroomers. The type of instrument used was
not associated with injury or high-frequency injuries.
Daily, weekly, monthly, and every 3- to 6-month groomers
had increased odds for high-frequency injuries (ie, >5 inju-
ries in their lifetime); however, this did not translate into an
injury requiring medical attention. No factors were associ-
ated with injuries requiring medical attention after adjust-
ing for false-positive findings. Removal of all pubic hair 6 to
10 times was not significant (AOR, 5.11; 95% CI, 1.03-25.3)
(Table 2).
Eight hundred sixty-eight women (27.1%) reported a
grooming-related injury. After adjustment, risk for any injury
increased in women who groomed weekly (AOR, 1.73; 95% CI,
1.10-2.73) and monthly (AOR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.25-2.95) and who
removedallpubichairmorethanonce(AOR,1.78;95%CI,1.22-
2.57). Hairiness was not associated with any injury, high-
frequencyinjuries,orinjuryrequiringmedicalattention.Daily,
weekly, and monthly female groomers had increased odds for
high-frequency injury (ie, >5 injuries in their lifetimes); how-
ever, this did not translate into an injury requiring medical at-
tention. Grooming instruments were not associated with any
injury; however, participants who most commonly waxed re-
ported fewer high-frequency injuries (AOR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.03-
0.43). Similar to men, women who removed all of their pubic
hair more than 2 to 5 times had increased odds of injury re-
quiring medical attention compared with those who did not

P < .001) (Table 3).
Injuries Requiring Medical Attention
Overall, 79 injuries in 5674 groomers (1.4%) required medi-
cal attention. No instrument carried a higher risk for this
type of injury compared with any other. Among men, com-
pared with injuries that did not require medical attention,
perineal (6 [15.8%] vs 54 [4.0%]) and inner thigh injuries (11
[28.9%] vs 84 [6.2%]) were more common in those who
required medical attention (P < .001). The location of injury
was not associated with an injury that required medical
attention in women. Compared with the general grooming
population, injuries that required medical attention
occurred more often when others were grooming the par-
ticipant’
s pubic hair (54 [68.4%] vs 176 [13.0 %]; P < .001)
and when the groomers were laying on their backs (20 [25.3
%] vs 103 [7.6%]; P < .001).

 Discussion
In our survey, more than 70% of respondents reported a his-
tory of grooming, with 66.5% of men and 85.3% of women re-
porting a history of ever removing their pubic hair; an injury
was reported by 25.6% of all groomers. Thus, we found that
grooming is common, and characteristics associated with in-
juryvariedbetweenmenandwomen.Groomingfrequencyand
removing all pubic hair multiple times are risk factors for in-
jury and high-frequency injuries in men and women. Hairier
men have an increased risk for injury. Waxing is protective for
high-frequency injuries in women. Injuries that require medi-
cal attention are rare (1.4% of all groomers), but these severe
injuries are associated with groomers who lie on their back and
who have others groom their pubic hair.
People groom their pubic hair for different reasons, in-
cluding sexual appeal, oral sex, partner preference, or rou-
tine care and hygiene.18,19 In our survey, more than 70% of re-
spondents reported a history of grooming. This result is
consistent with previously published rates of pubic hair re-
moval, ranging from 48% to 87% for women and 33% to 50%
for men, depending on age and sexual orientation.2,3,5,12,14,20
Unlike prior studies that we are aware of examining trends in
pubic hair removal,6,12,20 this survey included respondents
from a wide range of ages, geographic locations, and sexual
activity patterns that mirrored the current population of the
United States.17 We found significantly greater prevalence of
grooming among younger groups. This finding could signify
a generational trend, indicating that this behavior may con-
tinue to become more universal as the population ages.
Theprevalenceofinjuryamongourrespondentswashigh,
with 1 in 4 groomers reporting at least 1 injury. Furthermore,
32.2% of those injured reported experiencing 5 or more inju-
riesduringtheirlifetime.Althoughmostinjuriesreportedwere
minor, this high rate of injury emphasizes the need for safer
grooming practices. Although sequelae from grooming inju-
ries are self-limited, some injuries require medical and even
surgical treatment, highlighting morbidity associated with the
behavior. In particular, lying on one’
s back while grooming and
having someone else groom one’
s pubic hair were associated
with injuries that required medical attention. Lying on one’
s
back may make visualization more challenging and thus pre-
dispose the groomer to injury. Having a partner perform one’
s
grooming eliminates a self-tactile sensation, which may pre-
dispose to injury. Alternatively, a grooming partner may en-
courage the injured to seek medical attention.
In men and women, grooming frequency and removing
all pubic hair were associated with increased risk for injury
and repeated high-frequency injuries in a dose-response
fashion. Thus, increasing exposure to grooming, in particu-
lar the degree of hair removal, is associated with increased
risk for injury. Reasons for removing all pubic hair in women
have been linked to feelings of sexual attractiveness and

 self-enhancement.21 Reasons for removing all pubic hair in
men have not been studied to our knowledge, but pubic hair
grooming in general has been linked to increased sexual
activity and improved self-perception of appearance.19
Recently, removal of all pubic hair has been correlated
with increased risk for cutaneous sexually transmitted in-
fections, such as human papillomavirus and molluscum
contagiosum.10,22 Clinicians and health care professionals
should be aware of this risk factor, which may present an
opportunity to discuss not only safe-sex practices but also
grooming-related injury–prevention strategies.
Some grooming methods may be safer than others, al-
though more research is necessary. In this analysis, no groom-
ing instruments were associated with injury in men; how-
ever, waxing was protective against high-frequency injuries
in women. The discrepancy between instruments and injury
between men and women may be explained by differences in
the type of grooming or body depilation between men and
women. It is common practice for women to perform body de-
pilation via waxing, which is less common among men.23 Be-
cause waxing involves the removal of the entire hair follicle,
hair regrowth after waxing is prolonged.24 This may lead to
fewer grooming exposures and thus decreased risk for injury.
Severe injuries and infections have been reported from pubic
hair waxing, and we believe more research is necessary be-
foreclaimingthatwaxingisthesafestmodeofhairdepilation.9
Limitations
Our study had several limitations. A variety of factors, includ-
ing age, participation in grooming activities, and cultural con-
text, may have dissuaded recipients from responding to the
survey. Pubic hair grooming is a sensitive topic, and some in-
dividuals might have refused to answer our survey truthfully
owing to embarrassment or fear of breach in anonymity. Simi-
larly, respondents are subject to have recall bias. Those with
more serious injuries or with negative grooming experiences
may be more likely to remember or report injury, and minor
injuries may have been underreported. Finally, we relied on
patient self-reporting and were unable to corroborate accu-
racy of the information that the participants provided. Fu-
ture studies should evaluate whether behavioral changes in
groomingpracticesprospectivelypreventgrooming-relatedin-
juries. If at-risk patients are identified at clinical visits and are
educated about safer grooming practices, subsequent analy-
sis could assess for change in rates of injury after screening and
intervention.
Conclusions
Pubic hair grooming is a widespread practice, and grooming-
related injuries occur in approximately 25% of individuals who
groom. Laceration is the most common form of injury. Groom-
