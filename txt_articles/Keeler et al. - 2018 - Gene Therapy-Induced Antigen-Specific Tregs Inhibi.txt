The devastating neurodegenerative disease multiple sclerosis
(MS) could substantially benefit from an adeno-associated virus
(AAV) immunotherapy designed to restore a robust and dura-
ble antigen-specific tolerance. However, developing a suffi-
ciently potent and lasting immune-regulatory therapy that
can intervene in ongoing disease is a major challenge and has
thus been elusive. We addressed this problem by developing a
highly effective and robust tolerance-inducing in vivo gene ther-
apy. Using a pre-clinical animal model, we designed a liver-tar-
geting gene transfer vector that expresses full-length myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) in hepatocytes. We
show that by harnessing the tolerogenic nature of the liver,
this powerful gene immunotherapy restores immune tolerance
by inducing functional MOG-specific regulatory T cells (Tregs)
in vivo, independent of major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) restrictions. We demonstrate that mice treated prophy-
lactically are protected from developing disease and neurolog-
ical deficits. More importantly, we demonstrate that when given
to mice with preexisting disease, ranging from mild neurolog-
ical deficits to severe paralysis, the gene immunotherapy abro-
gated CNS inflammation and significantly reversed clinical
symptoms of disease. This specialized approach for inducing
antigen-specific immune tolerance has significant therapeutic
potential for treating MS and other autoimmune disorders.
INTRODUCTION
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex T cell-driven autoimmune
disease of the CNS for which there is no known cure. Although the
exact etiology is unknown, the disease is thought to result from
peripheral activation of myelin-reactive CD4+ effector T cells that
have escaped immune-regulatory mechanisms.1–5 Active suppression
by regulatory T cells (Tregs) plays a key role in the control of self-an-
tigen-reactive T cells and the induction of peripheral tolerance
in vivo.2 Unfortunately, abnormalities in the frequency or suppressive
function of peripheral CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Tregs have been
observed in various autoimmune diseases, including MS.6,7
An attractive therapeutic strategy for restoring self-tolerance and
controlling disease is to selectively induce autoantigen-specific
CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Tregs. Numerous studies have demonstrated
the power of Treg-based immunotherapies.6,8,9 For example, it has
been shown that adoptive transfer of polyclonal CD4+CD25+ Tregs
can temporarily prevent or reduce the neurological symptoms of
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the murine
model of MS.10 Recent clinical studies have reported that injection
of CD4+CD25+ Tregs appears to be a safe and effective cellular treat-
ment in patients with type 1 diabetes and graft-versus-host dis-
ease.11,12 In an attempt to generate sufficient cells, several ex vivo
approaches for expanding CD4+CD25+ Tregs or in vitro induction
of Tregs have been explored.9 Polyclonal and in vitro antigen-spe-
cific Treg expansion are two well-known methods that have been
used to generate an adequate amount of CD4+CD25+ Tregs. Unfor-
tunately, there are several obstacles blocking the development of
large-scale ex vivo or in vitro antigen-specific Treg expansion
techniques.13
An alternative and efficient in vivo approach for inducing Ag-specific
tolerance is through ectopic expression of an antigen in the liver.14,15
Leveraging the tolerogenic nature of the liver, hepatic gene transfer
has successfully been used to induce robust transgene tolerance in
large- and small-animal disease models.16,17 Viral vectors such as
adeno-associated virus (AAV) have emerged as an effective vehicle
for in vivo delivery of therapeutic genes to various tissues and are
currently
being
used

trials
(ClinicalTrials.gov).
In this study, we demonstrate that hepatic gene therapy with an AAV
vector containing the full DNA coding sequence for the neuroprotein,
myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), can prevent develop-
ment of and reverse preexisting EAE. The vector therapy resulted
in the induction/expansion of antigen-specific FOXP3+ Tregs.
When vector is administered prophylactically, mice were protected

 from developing EAE disease. When administered to mice exhibiting
mild-to-moderate neurological deficits, vector alone was effective at
reversing both clinical and pathological signs of disease. When com-
bined with a short course of immune suppression, the AAV immuno-
therapy can rescue mice from fatal end-stage EAE disease and restore
mobility after exhibiting severe paralysis.
RESULTS
Hepatic Gene Transfer with AAV8.MOG Induces
Immunosuppressive MOG-Specific Tregs
To study the ability of the liver to induce immune tolerance to a trans-
gene protein, we engineered an AAV8 vector to contain the full cod-
ing sequence (CDS) of the neuroprotein MOG and placed it under
control of a liver-specific promoter. To establish that AAV8.MOG
can transduce hepatocytes and will stably express the non-secreted
neuroprotein, C57BL/6 mice were systemically injected with a single
dose of the vector (1011 vector genomes). Western blot and real-time
qPCR analysis of liver lysates from tissue harvested 2 weeks later

confirmed vector transduction and hepatocyte
expression of MOG (Figures 1A and 1B).
Although MOG protein accounts for only
0.05%–0.1% of total myelin proteins, it is re-
ported to induce a more potent T cell response
than other myelin antigens in patients with
MS.18,19 To complicate matters, a loss of im-
mune tolerance because of deficits in either
Treg numbers or their function has been
observed in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including
MS.5 Previously, in a model used for protein replacement therapy,
we could only indirectly establish that hepatocyte expression induces
transgene (Tg)-specific Tregs.20 Here, we developed an experimental
system that allowed us to directly determine the frequency of MOG-
specific FOXP3+ Tregs. Using a transgenic C57BL/6 Foxp3-EGFP
reporter mouse that expresses EGFP under the control of the mouse
Foxp3 promoter (FOXP3gfp+), in combination with a MOG38–49/I-Ab
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) tetramer, allowed us to
directly identify AAV8.MOG-induced Tg-specific CD4+ Tregs (Fig-
ures 1C and 1D). To do so, we chose to analyze freshly isolated sple-
nocytes from mice that had previously received AAV8.MOG vector.
This allowed us to determine the real-time frequency of tetramer-spe-
cific cells as opposed to values amplified by ex vivo restimulation.21
Multi-parametric flow cytometry revealed a significantly higher
I-Ab MOG35–55 tetramer+ frequency from CD4+CD25+FOXP3gfp+
gated cells compared with the control (h.CLIP/I-Ab) tetramer
(p < 0.0001) (Figures 1C and 1D; Figure S1). Similarly, age-matched

 naive reporter mice failed to bind either tetramer at levels above that
of control mice, ruling out potential non-specific binding (Figure 1C).
These findings provide direct and unambiguous evidence that liver-
directed AAV induces transgene-specific Tregs in mice, further con-
firming that hepatic expression of a full-length transmembrane neu-
roprotein can indeed drive in vivo induction of antigen-specific Tregs.
Next, to test whether the vector-induced MOG-specific Tregs
were
functional,
we
compared
the
capacity
of
FAC-sorted
CD4+FOXP3gfp+ Tregs harvested from the spleens of AAV8.MOG
tolerized mice, or age-matched naive mice, to suppress the prolifer-
ation of MOG-specific effector T cells when co-cultured in the pres-
ence of the immunodominant MOG35–55 peptide. Indeed, at a 1:10
Treg/effector T cell (Teff) ratio, the vector-induced Tregs sup-
pressed 58% of the effector cell proliferation. This was nearly three
times more effective than naive polyclonal Tregs (Figures 1E
and 1F). These results demonstrate that hepatocyte expression of
a non-secreted transmembrane neuroprotein delivered by an
AAV8 vector induces functionally suppressive MOG-specific Tregs
in vivo.
Pre-treatment with AAV8.MOG Vector Prevents EAE Induction
Next, we asked whether given first, will AAV8.MOG induce trans-
gene-specific immune tolerance and protect susceptible mice from
developing EAE (Figure 2A). To answer this, we administered either
AAV8.MOG or AAV8.GFP (irrelevant transgene control) vector to
cohorts of mice. Two weeks later, mice were immunized with
MOG35–55 emulsified in complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) to induce
EAE. Mice were monitored for signs of neurological deficits using a
five-point scale as described (Table 1). Beginning 10 days after EAE
induction, mice receiving control vector developed severe neurolog-
ical impairments (maximum mean clinical score [MCS]: 3.15 ± 0.2)
(Figure 2B). Disease progression was also associated with increasing
anti-MOG35–55 immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 and IgG2c antibody titers
(Figures 2C and 2D). In contrast, mice that received AAV8.MOG
were protected and failed to develop clinical signs of EAE or produce
MOG35–55-specific antibody responses (Figures 2B–2D). Notably,
neurological deficits in control mice continued to increase in terms
of both maximum and cumulative EAE scores until they developed
severe paralysis and needed to be humanely euthanized.
Next, we evaluated the frequency of FOXP3+ Tregs in peripheral
blood mononuclear cells. Flow cytometry analysis results showed
that mice treated with AAV8.MOG had a small but significant
increased frequency of CD4+CD25hiFOXP3+ Tregs in peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) compared with control mice (Fig-
ure 2E), further supporting that AAV hepatic gene therapy adminis-
tration selectively expands FOXP3+ Treg populations and induces
tolerance to the encoded transgene antigen.16

C57BL/6 mice (9 weeks old) were intravenously injected with 1011 vg/mouse via the

 Although various proteins have been safely expressed in the liver
following AAV gene transfer,22 we wanted to evaluate the long-
term stability of MOG expression in hepatocytes in the context of
induced EAE. Elevations in serum/plasma alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) level are routinely used in the clinic to screen for liver disease
and cell-mediated immunity directed against AAV-transduced he-
patocytes.23,24 Analysis of plasma ALT enzyme activity in mice
�4 months after receiving gene transfer revealed no significant dif-
ference
between
AAV8.MOG-treated
and
age-matched
naive
C57Bl6 mice, indicating that AAV8.MOG did not induce chronic
liver disease (Figure 2F). Additionally, hepatocyte expression of
MOG persisted in the mice that received AAV8.MOG until termina-
tion of experiment at 200 days after EAE induction (Figure 1A).
Notably, throughout this protracted timeline, mice never developed
any observable signs of neurological disability or general distress,
suggesting that hepatocyte expression of MOG does not provoke
any deleterious immune responses. Collectively, these data demon-
strate that prophylactic administration of liver-directed AAV8.MOG
produces long-term stable hepatocyte expression of MOG that has
an immuno-suppressive effect capable of preventing the develop-
ment of EAE.
The Immune Tolerance Induced by AAV8.MOG Is Robust
Next, we evaluated whether a single vector injection could provide
long-term hepatic transgene expression and still induce immune
tolerance. Two cohorts of mice were injected, intravenously, with
either AAV8.MOG or PBS/sham (Figure 3A). EAE was induced in
both cohorts of animals �200 days later with MOG35–55/CFA. Mice
were then monitored daily, and collections of plasma and lympho-
cytes were obtained every 2 weeks for analysis and Treg staining.
Even though vector was given over 7 months earlier, mice that
received AAV8.MOG failed to develop any signs of EAE disease,
whereas the age-matched control mice began exhibiting neurological
deficits at day 14, which rapidly increased in severity (Figure 3B), and
began to succumb to disease as early as 16 days after EAE induction
(Figure 3C). These results demonstrate that vector-induced immune
tolerance is stable and can be maintained long term.
In EAE25–28 and other models of protein replacement gene ther-
apy,16,29 long-term induction of tolerance is often confirmed by re-
challenging the mice. To further demonstrate the robustness of our
immunotherapy, we evaluated the ability of the AAV8.MOG treat-
ment to maintain tolerance and prevent disease following a second
attempt to induce MOG-specific EAE. Almost 3 months after the
initial EAE induction (9.5 months from AAV8.MOG induction of
tolerance), both groups of mice were re-challenged with MOG35–55
and monitored for development of or change in clinical signs. In
the control mice, disease escalation occurred rapidly (Figure 3B).
Within 15 days, half of the re-challenged control mice succumbed
to disease, whereas 100% of the AAV8.MOG-treated mice survived
(Figure 3C). However, at 16 and 37 days after secondary challenge,
two mice developed a slow relapsing-remitting disease (Figure 3B,
right). Nonetheless, 80% of the mice that received AAV8.MOG vector
months earlier showed absolutely no signs of EAE or liver disease over
the course of the experiment (Figures 3B–3D). The disease escalation
in the control mice confirmed that vector-treated mice were indeed
tolerized and not simply protected via a vaccination mechanism.
Thus, these data clearly demonstrated that AAV8.MOG protection
is indeed stable and robust.
AAV8.MOG Immunotherapy Reverses Established EAE Disease
The early symptoms of MS are often minor and overlooked. Diag-
nosis is usually made after the first clinically isolated syndrome
(CIS), which is defined as an episode of neurological deficit that lasts
at least 24 hr and is caused by inflammation or demyelination.30 In
terms of rate and severity of disability, disease progression is highly
variable and difficult to predict, which often results in a diagnosis
well after disease has been established. Therefore, we investigated
whether induction of Ag-specific tolerance following AVV8.MOG
immunotherapy would be effective in diminishing or reversing dis-
ease in mice during progressive stages of neurological impairment.
In this series of experiments, EAE was induced in age-matched
mice before being treated with vector. As the mice developed signs
of neurological impairment, they were divided in an alternating
fashion into two different groups so that the baseline clinical scores
would be comparable between the groups (referred to as rolling
enrollment). As mice reached the target MCS, they were injected
with either AAV8.MOG or PBS/sham vector (Figures 4A–4C). In
the first cohort, mice received treatment early in the disease process
as they began to lose tail tonality (Figure 4A). Both groups of mice
continued to develop severe paralyzing EAE by day 7 (peak MCS:
�3.5). Strikingly, beginning around day 8, all but one mouse that
was treated with a single injection of AAV8.MOG began to exhibit
a significant reversal of clinical symptoms (final MCS: 0.5 ± 0.3). In
contrast, control mice proceeded to develop severe neurological dis-
abilities (final MCS: 3.3 ± 0.4). In the next iteration, we evaluated
the ability of AAV8.MOG immunotherapy to reverse moderate dis-
ease by withholding treatment until mice exhibited complete tail
paralysis (MCS: �1). Like before, both groups of mice rapidly devel-
oped severe EAE with hind-leg paralysis (Figure 4B). After a brief
remission, control mice relapsed and developed severe ascending pa-
ralysis (final MCS: 3.2 ± 0.4). In contrast, AAV8.MOG-treated mice

 went into a nearly complete remission and regained use of their hind
legs (final MCS: 0.7 ± 0.2) (Figure 4B).
Lastly, we further probed the ability of AAV8.MOG to induce tolerance
and abrogate disease in mice with even more advanced preexisting dis-
ease. Following induction of EAE, AAV8.MOG immunotherapy was
withheld until disease advanced and mice presented with complete
tail paralysis with hind-leg inhibition and loss of fine motor coordina-
tion thataffectedtheirgaitand balance(combined MCS:1.3± 0.2)(Fig-
ure 4C). Mice continued to develop severe EAE with hind-leg paralysis,
which critically impeded their ability to freely move around the cage
and obtain food (peak MCS: R3.3). By day 30, mice that received
AAV8.MOG immunotherapy had a significantly greater reduction in
clinical scores compared to control mice (p = 0.0412). Although not
as robust as previously seen, these results have substantial clinical rele-
vance. Notably, all the mice that responded to the gene immunotherapy
regained the ability to freely ambulate, whereas control mice continued
to have hind-leg paralysis.
Inflammation in the Spinal Cord of Treated Mice
In EAE, the spinal cord is the primary site of encephalitogenic
effector cells and demyelination, and the degree of neurological
impairment is related to the magnitude of inflammation during
the early stages of the disease.31 To determine whether the amelio-
ration of neurological deficits was associated with a reduction in
encephalitogenic inflammation and/or demyelination, we compared
serial sections from multiple regions of spinal cords from mice that
received AAV8.MOG, to control mice for pathological differences
35 days after receiving vector. Histological examination showed
that non-tolerized control mice had numerous foci of cellular infil-
trates that were co-localized to areas of demyelination within the
white matter (Figure 4D). In contrast, there was an absence of in-
flammatory lesions within the spinal cord of the mice treated with
AAV8.MOG. These findings were consistent across the other treat-
ment groups, as well as with previous literature.14,32 These results
suggest that AAV gene immunotherapy reverses the clinical symp-
toms associated with EAE disease through a mechanism that
suppresses tissue-specific inflammation.
Transient Immune Suppression Enhances AAV8.MOG
Immunotherapy in EAE
It has been shown in an EAE model that Tregs may accumulate in the
target tissue but are non-suppressive.21 The failure to suppress the
effector response is believed to be associated with the localized inflam-
mation causing a Th1/Th17 microenvironment within the CNS. As
suggested by the diminished impact of AAV8.MOG treatment in
mice with delayed treatment seen in Figure 4C, this pro-inflammatory
microenvironment may limit the effectiveness of the induced Tregs,
especially at the height of inflammation. To overcome this limitation,
we hypothesized that successful treatment may require adjunct
immune suppression to modulate the pro-inflammatory environ-
ment within the CNS.33,34 To address this, we investigated the immu-
nosuppressive drug rapamycin. Rapamycin has been used to suppress
graft refection in organ transplantation, and its safety and efficacy
have been evaluated for use in humans with MS.35 In general terms,
rapamycin has a potent anti-proliferative effect on antigen-stimulated
effector T cells, while simultaneously allowing expansion of
CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Tregs, making it an ideal choice.36,37
To test the hypothesis, we reestablished the experimental parame-
ters that previously produced the smallest degree of disease
reversal (Figure 4C). EAE was induced and AAV8.MOG treatment
was withheld until mice developed complete tail paralysis with
hind-leg paresis (MCS: 1.4 ± 0.1, combined). Immediately after
being treated with either AAV8.MOG or PBS/control, all mice

 received an intraperitoneal injection of rapamycin (5 mg/kg).
Subsequently, mice received two additional doses of rapamycin
(5 mg/kg) 48 hr apart (Figure 5). As expected, EAE disease pro-
gressed quickly and both groups of mice developed severe neuro-
logical deficits and paralysis (peak MCS: 2.9–3.0) (Figure 5A).
Within 72 hr of receiving the rapamycin, both AAV8.MOG-
treated and control mice responded to the immunosuppression
and displayed signs of remission (a sustained reduction in
MCS R1).35 However, by day 10, 100% of the control mice
had relapsed and rapidly developed end-stage EAE disease
(final MCS: 3.5 ± 0.3). In contrast, neurological deficits in
AAV8.MOG-treated mice continued to decrease, and all but
one animal (90%) achieved complete remission (final MCS:
0.5 ± 0.3) (Figure 5A). Additionally, in a separate experiment,
mice that received the AAV8.MOG vector/rapamycin combination
remained symptom free (final MCS: 0.2 ± 0.1) until termination of
the experiment at �100 days after EAE (Figure S2).

areas of inflammation (Luxol fast blue, bottom row). In
contrast, despite having reached a higher peak clinical
score, there was an absence of infiltrates in the CNS of
AAV8.MOG-treated mice.
Next, we tested the effectiveness of the combined
immunotherapy in late and end-stage EAE dis-
ease. In these cohorts, EAE disease was induced
as before and allowed to develop until the mice
began exhibiting complete tail and hind-limb
paralysis (MCS: 3.0 ± 0.0) (Figure 5B) or border-
line quadriplegia (hind-limb paralysis with forearm paresis that pre-
vents the mouse from righting itself when placed on its back) (MCS:
3.5 ± 0.0) (Figure 5C) before AAV8.MOG/rapamycin treatment was
administered. Remarkably, mice that received the AAV8.MOG/rapa-
mycin immunotherapy, 71% (Figure 5B) and 80% (Figure 5C), respec-
tively, responded to the treatment and went into near-complete remis-
sion (MCS: >1) by day �30. In contrast, after transiently responding to
the rapamycin, the control mice relapsed into severe paralyzing or
fatal EAE disease (Figures 5B and 5C). Notably, in both groups, a
limited number of the animals failed to respond to rapamycin immu-
nosuppression, suggesting the disease process was beyond the point of
rescue.
To better illustrate the severity of EAE disease progression and the
effect AAV8.MOG/rapamycin treatment has, a representative video
visually documenting the reversal of clinical symptoms is available

 Hepatocyte Expression of MOG in Combination with Rapamycin
Promotes Treg Expansion of Peripheral Tregs and Reverses EAE
Rapamycin blocks the activation of a serine/threonine protein kinase
called mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which has a potent
anti-proliferative effect on antigen-stimulated effector T and B cells.
This results in selective reduction of T helper (Th) 1, Th2, and
Th17 cells while simultaneously allowing the expansion of Ag-specific

contrast, when analyzed after the final rapamycin dose on day 10,
there was an �33% difference in total Tregs between control mice
receiving rapamycin alone and AAV8.MOG-treated animals (Figures
5D and 5E).
CD44 is a cell-surface glycoprotein involved in cell-to-cell interac-
tions that are important in activation, migration, and apoptosis. Its
relative expression has been associated with FOXP3 expression and
Treg function, and can be used to identify activated Tregs.38,39 Similar

 to activated effector or memory CD4+ T cells, activated Tregs also ex-
press high levels CD44.39 Restricting the analysis to activated Tregs
(CD4+CD44+ CD25hiFOXP3+) revealed a 58.9% increase in Tregs
in mice that received rapamycin and AAV8.MOG immunotherapy
(Figures 5D and 5F). In contrast, only a 10.5% increase was seen in
rapamycin-only-treated mice.
Plasma ALT levels were also monitored as an indicator of liver dam-
age and failure of therapy. As reported above, the level of ALT ac-
tivity detected in AAV8.MOG-treated mice and control mice was
unremarkable throughout the rapamycin treatment window (Fig-
ures 5G and 5H). However, at 35 days post-treatment the control
mice had a significant increase in plasma ALT levels that corre-
sponded with an increase in clinical score (MCS: 3.6 ± 0.5, final).
Based on the profound level of neurological impairment the control
mice were experiencing, the significant rise in ALT is indicative of
liver toxicity associated with end-stage organ failure (Figures 5B
and 5C).
Collectively, these findings demonstrate that transient immunosup-
pression with rapamycin has a synergistic effect on AAV8.MOG
immunotherapy that selectively induces in vivo expansion of Tregs
and restores tolerance in an antigen-dependent manner.36
DISCUSSION
MS is a complex autoimmune disease that has no cure. Early diag-
nosis and aggressive treatment with immunomodulating agents can
lower the relapse rate and slow progression. However, these treat-
ments are generally non-specific and risk significant side effects
with long-term use.40 Newer disease-modifying therapies that target
specific immune responses or target specific CNS antigens have
shown potential, but various experimental limitations have prevented
clinical translation.8,41,42
Tregs are an essential component in preventing autoimmunity and
controlling responses to alloantigens. A disruption in the homeostasis
of tolerance in a variety of autoimmune diseases, including MS, may
result from a substantial decrease in the number or functional impair-
ment of Tregs.7,43 Using the EAE model, studies have shown that
adoptive transfer of polyclonal Tregs is able to attenuate the develop-
ment of autoimmune diseases.10 In contrast, disease was exacerbated
when CD4+CD25+ Tregs were depleted.44 Additionally, adoptive
transfer of autologous ova-specific ex vivo-expanded Tregs has been
evaluated in a clinical trial for Crohn’s disease.45 Although the treat-
ment was well tolerated and showed efficacy, the results were only
transient, lasting about 5 weeks, which is supported by in vivo and
in vitro data suggesting that ova-Tregs have a limited survival capac-
ity upon chronic activation.45 Other difficulties with ex vivo expan-
sion of antigen-specific Tregs include proper identification of
antigens, long culture times, and overall expense.
Although the mechanism is unclear, various in vivo techniques,
such as transgenic expression, liver-targeting nanoparticles, and
lentivirus (LV)-mediated gene transfer, have been shown to leverage
the natural ability of the liver to induce specific tolerance to an
ectopically
expressed
autoantigen.14,15,17,20,46–48
However,
even
though these and other studies have provided mechanistic insight,
their clinical value is unclear. Rather, an approach is needed that
is translatable to the clinic and achieves robust in vivo induction
of a durable Treg response, capable of reversing established autoim-
mune disease.
Addressing these requirements, the liver-directed AAV immuno-
therapy procedure presented here is based on the clinically tested
AAV gene therapy platform. Overall, it provides a less complex
approach for inducing antigen-specific Tregs in vivo.16,49 We have
shown that a single dose of vector established a durable source of
antigen needed for sustained induction and activation of autoreactive
Tregs. Additionally, having engineered the vector to include the full
coding sequence of MOG, it is likely to induce multiple immunodo-
minant and sub-dominant antigen-specific Tregs, independent of
MHC restrictions and without compromising long-term immune
homeostasis. This is supported by our previous work in a hemophilia
model where an AAV vector expressing clotting factor IX was used to
induce tolerance to the same transgene in multiple strains of
mice.29,46,50,51
As explained above, Treg immunotherapy for MS has to be capable of
reversing established disease in order to be clinically feasible. The data
presented clearly demonstrate that AAV.MOG immunotherapy not
only prevents induction of the autoimmune disease, but more impor-
tantly clearly reverses preexisting disease if administered during early
onset. Albeit, AAV immunotherapy alone was not sufficient to fully
reverse end-stage EAE disease. However, when augmented with tran-
sient immunosuppression, a potent synergistic effect was revealed
that rescued mice with rapidly progressing paralysis. The use of rapa-
mycin was specifically chosen because it induces de novo expression
of FOXP3 and expands functional FOXP3+ Tregs from naive cells
in vivo, while inhibiting the proliferation and trafficking of conven-
tional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.37,52–54 Rapamycin has also been shown
to be effective at modulating EAE. Esposito et al.35 demonstrated that
continuous rapamycin monotherapy can effectively inhibit the induc-
tion and the progression of established disease; however, upon with-
draw of the drug, mice rapidly developed a relapsing-remitting form
of EAE. Clearly, mitigating the inflammation in the CNS was neces-
sary for the AAV8.MOG immunotherapy to be maximally effective.
Along similar lines, it is tempting to suggest that AAV immuno-
therapy alone (without the use of rapamycin immunosuppression)
could reverse disease if given during a natural period of remission.
However, because the EAE model used in this study does not undergo
a relapsing-remitting cycle, direct evaluation was not possible.
In summary, we have developed a novel immunotherapy that reverses
debilitating paralysis in an animal model of MS that is superior to the
traditional non-specific immunosuppression therapies currently
available. The application of this approach as a clinical therapy for
treating MS and other human autoimmune diseases warrants further
investigation.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal Strains
Female (9- to 12-week-old) inbred C57BL/6 and C57BL/6-Tg
(Tcra2D2,Tcrb2D2), 1Kuch/J (MOGTCR 2D2), and B6.129(Cg)-
Foxp3tm3(DTR/GFP)Ayr/J (FOXP3gfp+) mice were purchased from Jack-
son Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). All procedures involving
animals were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the
University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC).
Vector Production
A recombinant AAV8 vector expressing full-length MOG under a
hepatocyte-specific promoter was produced by the method of trans-
fection using anionic liposomes as a transfection reagent into human
embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, below passage 50. Two plasmid
DNAs—recombinant construct flanked by the AAV inverted termi-
nal repeats (iTRs), pAAV-Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)/hAAT-MOG,
and a helper plasmid for AAV8 serotype (pDG8) mixed in equimolar
amount—totaling 90 mg per 15 cm plate were added to each plate con-
taining �1 � 107 cells. Virus was recovered from both cells and me-
dium. Medium was collected on days 2 and 4 post-transfection, with
consequent virus precipitation with 40% polyethylene glycol (PEG)
8000/2.5 M NaCl solution. Cells were resuspended in 20 mM Tris/
HCl (pH 8.5)/15 mM NaCl lysis buffer, 10 mL per 1–2 � 108 cells.
Cells were lysed by one-time freeze/thaw cycle and three rounds,
1 min each, of sonication on ice. Virus pelleted by PEG/NaCl was pro-
cessed similarly to the virus recovered from the cells and combined.
Clarified lysates ran on a step iodixanol density gradient55 and dia-
lyzed/concentrated on Apollo 20 spinning devices. The titer of each
preparation was estimated using a dot-blot assay.
Induction of EAE
Mice were immunized by subcutaneous injection of MOG35–55 in
CFA (Hooke Labs, Lawrence, MA, USA). Pertussis toxin (PT)
200 ng (Hooke Labs, Lawrence, MA, USA) was injected intraperito-
neally (i.p.) 6 and 24 hr later. The clinical symptoms of EAE were
checked daily and graded on a clinical score of 0–5: 0, no clinical signs;
0.5, partially limp tail; 1.0, paralyzed tail; 2.0, loss of coordinated
movement and hind-limb paresis; 2.5, one hind limb paralyzed; 3.0,
both hind limbs paralyzed; 3.5, hind limbs paralyzed and weakness
in forelimbs; 4.0, forelimbs paralyzed (quadriplegia); and 5.0, mori-
bund. Mice had to reach inclusion criteria of an MCS R2.0 to be
included in the study group. Mice would be euthanized if an MCS
R4.0 was maintained for 48 hr, as per IACUC policy.
Vector Administration
To examine the prophylactic effect of vector administration, we in-
jected 7- to 9-week-old female C57BL/6 mice with 1011 vector
genomes (vg) of AAV8.MOG or control vector. Two weeks later,
EAE was induced. To evaluate the therapeutic effect of vector admin-
istration, we induced EAE first in 9- to 11-week-old mice before. As
mice reached the targeted/indicated severity of disease they were in-
jected with 1011 vg of AAV8.MOG or control vector (scAAV.GFP or
sham/PBS) via the tail vein. Rapamycin (LC Laboratories, Woburn,
MA,
USA)
was
dissolved
in
a
vehicle
solution
containing
(0.2% w/v) carboxymethyl-cellulose sodium salt (C-5013) and
(0.25% v/v) polysorbate-80 (P-8074) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA)
in distilled water and stored at 4�C protected from light according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Rapamycin (5 mg/kg) was given
i.p. as indicated for a total of three and five doses beginning on the
day of vector administration.
Gene Expression
Messenger RNA was isolated from 30 mg of liver samples harvested
from mice that had received vector 2 weeks earlier using the RNeasy
kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA). Real-time qPCR was performed
in duplicate using RT2 qPCR Primer Assay for Mouse MOG
(QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. A MyIQ
iCycler fluorescent detection system with iQ5 operating software
Version 2.0 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) was used to
generate and analyze data. All gene expression was compared with
that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.56
Flow Cytometry
Peripheral blood cells or splenocytes harvested from mice and pro-
cessed to produce single-cell suspensions were stained with antibodies
to CD3 (145-2C11), CD4 (RM4-5), CD25 (PC61), CD8 (53-6.7),
B220 (RA3-6B2), CD44 (IM7), and CD62L (MEL14) (BD Biosci-
ences, San Jose, CA, USA). Class II MHC tetramers included
MOG38–49/I-Ab
class
II
MHC
(GWYRSPFSRVVH)
and
h.CLIP87–101 (PVSKMRMATPLLMQA), and were provided by the
NIH Tetramer Core (Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA). Red
blood cell lysis was performed with VersaLyse (Beckman Coulter,
Brea, CA, USA). Intracellular staining for FOXP3 was performed us-
ing the FOXP3 staining kit (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). Sam-
ples were analyzed on an LSR-II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and
post-analyzed using FCS Express 4 (Denovo Software, Los Angeles,
CA, USA).
In Vitro Suppression Assay
Spleens from FOXP3gfp+ mice that received vector no less than
2 weeks earlier were homogenized and enriched for CD4+ T cells
by magnetic depletion of non-target cells over an LS column (Miltenyi
Biotec, San Diego, CA, USA). GFP+ cells, representing the Treg pop-
ulation of CD4+ T cells (�10%), were further isolated using the
FACSAria II cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Splenocytes isolated from
2D2-MOGTCR mice were labeled with CellTrace Violet (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
CD4+FOXP3GFP+ Tregs and CellTrace Violet-labeled responder sple-
nocytes were seeded at the indicated effector/responder ratios in com-
plete 5% RPMI media containing 1 mg/mL MOG35–55 peptide for
72 hr at 37�C. Cells were resuspended and stained with anti-CD4
antibody to assess proliferation of responder CD4+ T cells. GFP
was used to discriminate between responder cells and Tregs. Prolifer-
ation was determined by quantitating CellTrace Violet fluorescence
intensity relative to the parent population of unstimulated responder
cells (0% proliferation) and stimulated cells incubated without Tregs

 (100% proliferation). Percentage of CD4+ responder T cell prolifera-
tion was determined using FCS Express 4.
Analysis of Plasma Samples
Plasma was analyzed for anti-MOG IgG1 and IgG2c by ELISA as pre-
viously described.46
Western Blot
Protein was extracted from liver tissue using T-PER Tissue Extraction
Reagent (Thermo) in the presence of Halt Protease Inhibitor
(Thermo). Total protein concentration was measured using the bicin-
choninic acid protein assay (Pierce). Samples was separated on
4%–20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane following standard proto-
cols. After blocking, the membrane was incubated for 1 hr at room
temperature with antibody against MOG or b-actin in 1% fat-free
dry milk in 1� tris-buffered saline with tween (TBST). HRP-conju-
gated secondary antibody was used for signal detection with the
ECL 2 Western Blotting Substrate (Pierce).
Histopathology
For histopathological analysis of the spinal cord, formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded, 5 mm sections were stained with Luxol Fast
Blue or H&E by standard procedures.
Statistical Analysis
Results are reported in figure legends as mean ± SEM, unless other-
wise stated. Statistical significance was determined using GraphPad
Prism software (La Jolla, CA, USA). The p values are reported as
indicated.
Study Approval
All studies were in accordance with protocols approved by IACUC at
the University of Florida, Gainesville.
