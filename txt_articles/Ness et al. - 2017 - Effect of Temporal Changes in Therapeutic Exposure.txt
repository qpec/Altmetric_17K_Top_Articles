Abstract
Background—The impact of temporal changes in cancer therapy on health status among 
childhood cancer survivors has not been evaluated.
Objective—Compare proportions of self-report of adverse health status outcomes across three 
decades among childhood cancer survivors.
Design—Cross-sectional
Setting—27 North American institutions
Participants—14,566 adults, ≥5 year survivors (median age 27, range 18-48 years) treated 
1970-1999
Measurements—Patient-report of poor general or mental health, functional impairment, activity 
limitation, cancer-related anxiety or pain were evaluated as a function of treatment decade, cancer 
treatment exposures, chronic health conditions, demographics, and health habits.
Results—Despite reductions in late-mortality and proportions with severe, disabling or life 
threatening chronic health conditions (33.4% among survivors treated 1970-79, 21.0% among 
those treated 1990-99), proportions reporting adverse health status did not decrease by treatment 
decade. When compared to those diagnosed 1970-79, survivors diagnosed 1990-99 were more 
likely to report poor general health (11.2% vs. 13.7%, p < 0.001) and cancer-related anxiety 
(13.3% vs. 15.0%, p < 0.001). From 1970-79 to 1990-99, the proportions reporting adverse 
outcomes were higher (p < 0.001) among leukemia (9.5% vs. 13.9%, poor general health) and 
osteosarcoma (23.9% vs. 36.6%, pain) survivors. Temporal changes in treatment exposures were 
not associated with changes in proportions reporting adverse health status. However, smoking, not 
meeting physical activity guidelines, and being either underweight or obese were associated with 
poor health status.
Limitations—The considerable improvement in survival among children diagnosed with cancer 
in the 1990s compared to those diagnosed in the 1970s makes it difficult to definitively determine 
the impact of risk factors on later self-reported health status without considering their impact on 
mortality itself.
Conclusions—Because survival rates following a diagnosis of childhood cancer have improved 
substantially over the past thirty years, this population now includes persons who would have died

 in earlier eras. Unfortunately, self-reported health status among those that do survive has not 
improved. This is despite evolution of treatment designed to reduce toxicities, and is an important 
reminder that even in the modern era, cancer cure is not without consequences.”
Introduction
Progress in treatment and supportive care for children with cancer has improved survival 
resulting in increasing numbers of childhood cancer survivors (1, 2). Unfortunately, a 
substantial number of survivors have chronic medical conditions resulting from cancer 
and/or therapy that alter health status and interfere with daily life (3-6). Ten to 25% of 
survivors of childhood cancer in their twenties and thirties report adverse health status 
including poor general health, poor mental health, functional impairment, activity limitation, 
cancer-related pain and cancer-related anxiety (4, 7-9). Of concern, these estimates are not 
static; longitudinal data indicate increased risk for adverse health status outcomes as 
survivors age (9, 10).
Since adverse health status outcomes are associated with specific treatment exposures, data 
describing risk of late effects have been used to modify clinical trials for newly diagnosed 
patients with the goals of maximizing survival, decreasing late effects of cancer therapy and 
improving overall health status (11-14). The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS), a 
multi-institutional cohort study of childhood cancer survivors, has provided a wealth of 
information on prevalence and predictors of adverse health status that directly apply to 
survivors treated in North America between 1970 and 1986 (15, 16). Analysis of the recently 
expanded CCSS cohort to include individuals diagnosed between 1987 and 1999 
demonstrates that survivors treated in more recent decades have reduced risk for late 
mortality (17), due in part to reduction in therapeutic exposures. However, the proportions 
reporting adverse health status among survivors treated with more contemporary therapy is 
not known.
Given this extension in lifespan for more contemporary survivors, the aims of this analysis 
were to: 1) determine the proportions of adult survivors of childhood cancer reporting 
adverse health status outcomes by treatment decade (1970-79, 1980-89, 1990-99) compared 
to rates in siblings; and 2) evaluate associations between diagnosis, temporal changes in 
treatment, chronic health conditions, demographic characteristics and health habits on 
adverse health status as a function of treatment decade. We hypothesized that survivors from 
the 1990s, treated with contemporary therapy, would report better health status compared to 
survivors from the 1970s.
Methods
These analyses included childhood cancer survivors participating in the CCSS treated from 
1970-1999 at 27 institutions in North America. Survivors eligible for these analyses were 
diagnosed when < 21 years and had survived ≥ 5 years from original diagnosis. Analyses 
were restricted to survivors who completed a baseline questionnaire when ≥ 18 years and 
consented to medical record abstraction, and siblings ≥ 18 years when they completed the 
baseline questionnaire (see Supplemental Figure 1) (15, 16). Study documents were

 approved by institutional review boards at each site; informed consent was obtained from 
participants. Data for these analyses were restricted to participants’ responses on the first 
(“baseline”) questionnaire.
Health status
Adverse health status was determined using established definitions in four domains for 
survivors and siblings and two additional domains for survivors (7). Participants were 
considered to have poor general health if they answered poor or fair when asked “Would you 
say that your health is excellent, very good, good, fair or poor?”, and poor mental health if 
responses on the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18) (18) resulted in a sex-specific T-
score of 63 or higher on the Global Severity Index or depression, anxiety, or somatization 
subscales. Functional impairments were considered present among participants reporting 
needing help with personal care, routine needs, or difficulty attending school or work. 
Activity limitations were considered present among participants reporting limitations in 
moderate activities (e.g. walking one block) in ≥3 months of the past two years. Survivors 
also rated pain related to cancer or treatment (adverse status defined as medium, a lot or very 
bad, excruciating pain) and fears/anxiety related to cancer or treatment (adverse status 
defined as medium, a lot or very many, extreme fears/anxiety).
Chronic conditions
Chronic health conditions were categorized using the Common Terminology for Adverse 
Events version 4.03 as none (Grade 0), mild/asymptomatic (Grade 1), or moderate/minimal 
local or non-invasive intervention indicated (Grade 2), versus severe, medically significant, 
disabling (Grade 3), and life-threatening (Grade 4) (19).
Decade, diagnosis, cancer therapy
Information related to diagnosis and treatment modalities/doses was obtained from medical 
records. Treatment decade (1970-79, 1980-89, 1990-99) was assigned based on diagnosis 
date. Time from diagnosis to survey completion was treated as a continuous variable. 
Diagnosis-specific (ALL, astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, HL, NHL, neuroblastoma, Wilms 
tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma) surgery, radiation and 
chemotherapy variables were selected for evaluation (Supplemental Table 1) based upon 
changes in treatment standards over time (20, 21), or because of previously established 
associations with adverse health status outcomes (7, 10, 22). To illustrate treatment changes 
over time, a variable, “treatment score”, was calculated using multivariable piecewise 
exponential models to estimate risk of any chronic condition ≥grade 3, with an offset of the 
logarithm of person years at risk, terminated at the onset of any chronic condition ≥grade 3 
or censoring, and diagnosis-specific treatment exposures as risk factors (Supplemental Table 
1). Specifically, this value is the standardized logarithm (those from 1970-1979 had mean 
0.0, standard deviation 1) of fitted risk of having any ≥grade 3 chronic health condition 
(Supplemental Table 2), based on diagnosis-specific treatment exposures. Therefore, 
survivors with greater risk of ≥grade 3 chronic conditions have a higher treatment score (17).

 Demographic characteristics, health habits
Attained age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking history, alcohol-intake history, body mass index 
(BMI) and physical activity levels were determined from questionnaire responses. Age was 
treated as a continuous variable and race/ethnicity as a dichotomy (“non-Hispanic white”; 
“other”). Smoking status (>100 cigarettes) was categorized as never, past or current (23). 
Heavy drinking was defined as > 4 drinks/day or >14 drinks/week for males and >3 
drinks/day or >7 drinks/week for females (24). BMI was categorized as underweight (<18.5 
kilograms per square meter (kg/m2)), normal (18.5-24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25.0-29.9 
kg/m2) or obese (≥30 kg/m2) (25). Inactivity was defined as <the equivalent of 150 minutes 
of moderate/75 minutes of vigorous weekly physical activity (26).
Statistics
Descriptive statistics were compared between survivors and siblings and across decades with 
Chi-square or t-tests. Proportions reporting adverse health status were compared between 
siblings and survivors by treatment decade in generalized linear regression models adjusted 
for attained age, race and sex. Among survivors, associations between decade of treatment 
and adverse health status outcomes were examined within diagnosis-specific groups by 
contrasting relative risks (RR) from three multivariable models for each outcome, adjusted 
for attained age, time since diagnosis, race and sex. The first models evaluated associations 
between treatment decade (decade) and adverse health status. The second (decade-treatment) 
models were additionally adjusted for treatment variables (Supplemental Table 1), and the 
third (decade-chronic condition) for any grade 3-4 chronic health condition. We 
hypothesized that attenuation of RR from the decade-only to the decade-treatment model 
would suggest that treatment exposures explain, at least partially, associations between 
treatment decade and adverse health status. Similarly, attenuation of RR from the decade-
only to the decade-chronic condition model would indicate that chronic health conditions 
explain, at least partially, associations between treatment decade and adverse health status. 
Regression was also used to evaluate associations between treatment decade, demographic 
characteristics and health habits with health status outcomes among survivors. Because of 
the availability of large numbers of ALL survivors, to reduce study costs, while still 
preserving statistical power, and to assure adequate numbers of less commonly diagnosed 
childhood cancer types, ALL survivors diagnosed 1987-1999 were under sampled. Sampling 
weights were applied in all modeling. SAS 9.3 (Cary, N.C.) was used for analyses.
Role of Funding Source
The funding sources had no role in the design and conduct of the study, collection, 
management, analysis or interpretation of the data or in preparation, review or approval of 
the manuscript.
Results
Characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1. Survivors included 4,618 
diagnosed 1970-79; 4,669 diagnosed 1980-89; and 5,279 1990-99. Among those eligible for 
these analyses, participation rates did not differ by treatment decade: 66% for 1970-79; 61% 
for 1980-89, and 64% for 1990-99 (p=0.22). Participation differed by diagnosis and was

 highest among survivors of ALL (73%) and lowest among survivors of neuroblastoma 
(50%). At the time they responded to the baseline survey, survivors treated 1970-79 were 
slightly older and further from diagnosis than those treated 1990-99, more likely to report 
non-Hispanic white race, less likely to be obese or report heavy drinking, and more likely to 
report current smoking. Siblings were more likely than survivors to be female, have health 
insurance and report current smoking.
Temporal changes-exposures
Provided in Table 2 (Supplemental Tables 3-12) are decade-specific distributions of 
survivors by diagnosis and therapeutic exposure (17, 27). The percentage of survivors 
exposed to cranial radiotherapy (CRT) decreased across time, primarily due to the declining 
use of prophylactic CRT in dose ranges 1800-2400 centigray (cGy) for ALL. Therefore, 
those exposed to CRT in the 1990s were primarily those with CNS tumors who received 
higher mean doses. The percentage of survivors exposed to chest radiation also decreased 
from the 1970s to the 1990s (17.3% decrease HL, 13.3% decrease neuroblastoma). Use of 
amputation for local control of osteosarcoma decreased from 80.3% in the 1970s to 22.8% 
in the 1990s. Over the three decades, the percentage of survivors exposed to nearly every 
type of chemotherapy agent increased, but with lower cumulative doses.
Temporal changes-chronic health conditions
A decrease in proportions with severe, medically significant, disabling or life-threatening 
chronic health conditions is shown in Table 2, with 33.4%, 25.8%, and 21.0% of survivors 
(mean±SD age 26.1±6.1 years) diagnosed from 1970-79, 1980-89, and 1990-99, 
respectively, reporting at least one grade 3-4 chronic health condition.
Temporal changes-health status
Despite an overall decrease in radiation exposure, reduced mean chemotherapy doses, and a 
decline in proportions with grade 3-4 chronic health conditions, in general, patient-reported 
health status did not improve across treatment decades (Supplemental Table 13, Figure 1). 
The percentage of survivors reporting poor general health and cancer-related anxiety was 
highest among survivors treated 1990-99 and lowest in those treated 1970-79 (13.7% vs. 
11.2% and 15% vs 13.3% respectively). Patient-reported poor general health, poor mental 
health, functional impairment, activity limitation or an adverse outcome in any of these four 
domains did not improve, with survivors more likely than siblings to report adverse health 
status outcomes in each (or any) domain.
Treatment decade (1970s, 1980s, 1990s) was associated with changes in proportions 
reporting adverse health status primarily among ALL, astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, and 
osteosarcoma survivors (Figure 2, Supplemental Table 14). The percentage of ALL survivors 
reporting poor general health (9.5%, 9.9%, 13.9%) and cancer-related pain (7.5%, 9.5%, 
13.7%) or anxiety (11.3%, 12.2%, 16.1%) increased across treatment decades. After 
adjusting for treatment exposures, associations between treatment decade and both poor 
general health and cancer-related pain became non-significant. However, adjusting for 
presence of any grade 3-4 chronic health condition did not influence these associations. The 
association between treatment decade and cancer-related anxiety was not attenuated by

 including treatment exposures or chronic conditions in multivariable models. The percentage 
of astrocytoma survivors reporting functional impairment (33.4%, 28.9%, 18.1%) and 
activity limitation (21.1%, 15.4%, 12.5%) decreased across time. Adjusting for treatment 
exposure or chronic health conditions did not impact associations between treatment decade 
and functional impairment. However, the association between treatment decade and activity 
limitation became non-significant when treatment exposures or grade 3-4 chronic health 
conditions were included in models. The percentage of medulloblastoma survivors reporting 
functional impairment also decreased over time (45.8%, 28.6%, 26.5%), although treatment 
decade was not associated with this change. The proportion of osteosarcoma survivors 
reporting poor general health (12.8%, 9.4%, 16.3%), poor mental health (16.8%, 17.3%, 
24.8%) and cancer-related pain (23.9%, 23.4%, 26.6%) increased across time. The effects of 
treatment decade remained significant for pain, but were attenuated for poor general and 
mental health when treatment exposures were included in models. Including chronic health 
conditions in models did not influence associations between treatment decade and poor 
general health, poor mental health or cancer-related pain.
Table 3 shows relative risks for adverse health status outcomes among survivors by 
treatment decade, demographic characteristics and health habits. In multivariable models, 
when compared to those treated 1970-79, those treated 1990-99 had an increased risk for 
poor general health and anxiety. Female sex, other race, BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 or > 24.9 kg/m2, 
physical inactivity and smoking were associated with increased risk for poor general health, 
functional impairment, poor mental health and anxiety. Heavy drinking was inversely 
associated with functional impairments and activity limitations, but was not associated with 
chronic disease status (16.6% among those with no vs. 13.1% among those with any grade 
3-4 chronic condition).
Conclusions
While contemporary therapy for certain childhood cancers has resulted in reduction of late 
mortality, extending the lifespan of survivors (17), our findings suggest that there is not 
concurrent improvement in patient-reported health status among survivors. This is important 
as perceived health and well-being have been associated with long-term mortality in other 
adult cohorts (28-30). Overall, we observed increases in the percentages of childhood cancer 
survivors treated from 1990-99 who reported poor general health and anxiety, and found that 
accounting for specific treatment exposures, in most instances, did not explain effects of 
treatment decade on adverse health status outcomes. Demographic characteristics and high-
risk health behaviors were associated with an increased risk for adverse health status. Thus, 
while the results of our analysis do not generally support anticipated benefits to health status 
expected from reductions in therapy, they do provide potential targets for clinical counseling 
and intervention among the increasing number of long-term survivors of childhood cancer.
There are several potential explanations for lack of improvement in health status outcomes 
reported by survivors treated over three decades. First, there has been a substantial increase 
in survival among children diagnosed with cancer. Estimates indicate that five-year survival 
rates for children diagnosed with cancer improved from 62.8% in 1975 to 79.8% in 1999 (2). 
It is possible that those who would have died in the earliest era, but lived in the most recent

 era, are those that on average, would report worse later health outcomes. It is likely that 
contemporary cohorts contain a greater proportion of survivors cured of higher risk disease, 
who would have previously died because of their cancer or treatment complications. Risk-
adapted therapy minimized treatment intensity for children with low-risk disease in the 
1990s, whereas children with high risk for relapse or mortality continued to receive more 
intensive treatment (31). This is exemplified among ALL survivors, for whom we found a 
small but consistent increase in the percentage reporting adverse outcomes in three of six 
health status domains. Among children with ALL, gains in survival over the study period 
were realized with evolution of therapies designed to cure children with high-risk disease 
(32), whereas decreases in long-term morbidity resulted from reduction of therapies to 
minimize late-effects in those with low-risk disease (33). Our data suggest that a smaller 
proportion of ALL survivors have medically significant, detectable chronic conditions 
(treated for high-risk disease), whereas a more sizable proportion may have subclinical 
chronic conditions that interfere with daily function. Second, there has been a decrease in 
late mortality among childhood cancer survivors (1), potentially because surveillance and 
identification allows for earlier medical management of subclinical health conditions. Early 
screening and disease management may reduce mortality, but may not positively influence 
perception of health status (34), which may result in survivors rating their health as worse. 
Finally, it is possible that survivors of childhood cancer treated in a more recent era who 
were more likely to have access to organized follow-up care (35) and educational materials 
about medical late effects (36), and who were treated when disclosure of mental health 
issues and pain were more acceptable, developed different internal standards (expectations) 
upon which to judge health status outcomes. Thus, those treated 1990-99 may be more likely 
to anticipate and/or report adverse outcomes than those treated 1970-79.(37)
In previous reports from the CCSS, the highest proportions of functional limitations were 
among CNS and bone tumor survivors (7). Since treatment approaches for these disease 
groups evolved over the decades to minimize adverse events, we expected rates of functional 
limitation to decrease over time. We observed improvement among astrocytoma and 
medulloblastoma survivors, where changes in treatment included improved surgical 
techniques and reductions in CRT dose/volume (20, 38, 39). However, there was no 
improvement among osteosarcoma survivors, where the biggest change in treatment was 
replacement of amputation with limb-sparing surgery. Our findings are consistent with 
literature that indicates a dose-response association (7% (1-13%) per Gray) between CRT 
dose and risk for adverse events among childhood brain tumor survivors (40), and with 
meta-analyses that report no difference in long-term disability among childhood sarcoma 
survivors who require amputation compared to those who had limb-sparing surgery (41).
The increase from the 1970s to the 1990s in percentage of ALL and osteosarcoma survivors 
who report cancer-related pain years after diagnosis is concerning. Among ALL survivors, 
this may be related to increased use of intrathecal therapy to treat CNS disease in the more 
recent era. Data indicate that back pain is a frequent complaint of adult survivors of ALL 
(42), and that back pain and neuropathy are associated with the number of intrathecal 
chemotherapy administrations (43). In osteosarcoma survivors, this may be due to increases 
in numbers of younger patients eligible for limb-sparing related to availability of expandable 
prostheses in the 1990s, many of whom required multiple surgeries to manage orthopedic

 complications. Dotan et al (44) reported an average of 6.2 complications, requiring 83 
additional surgeries, among 22/38 children. Likewise, Ruggieri et al (45) reported implant-
related complications among 17/32 children (72 months of follow-up) with lower extremity 
sarcoma who had limb-sparing using expandable prostheses.
As in the general population (46), smoking, body composition, inactivity, non-white race 
and female sex were associated with adverse health status outcomes among childhood 
cancer survivors. This indicates that survivors may be able to influence health status 
outcomes by modifying high-risk personal behaviors. Survivors who smoke, are inactive or 
obese should be directed to interventions designed to eliminate smoking (47), increase 
activity (48) and achieve a healthy weight (48). In addition, clinicians who treat female and 
non-white survivors and researchers designing interventions should consider these factors 
(49, 50) when counseling patients or developing targeted strategies to improve health status. 
Of note, we found an association between heavy drinking and functional impairments and 
activity limitations in our cohort. These data seem implausible, but are consistent with other 
studies among middle age adults where the highest odds for physical limitations are among 
never-drinkers and among individuals who quit drinking because of illness (51). Because we 
did not collect data on drinking history in our cohort, we were unable to directly evaluate 
this. However, there were no differences in the percentages of individuals who reported 
heavy drinking by chronic condition status.
These results should be considered in the context of potential study limitations. First of all, 
these analyses include many parallel comparisons, not adjusted for multiplicity. Chance 
alone could account for some of our findings. Second, not every survivor eligible for CCSS 
agreed to participate. Even though we stratified our analyses by diagnoses, participants may 
have been healthier or sicker than non-participants which could bias estimates either toward 
or away from the null. Third, the considerable improvement in survival among children 
diagnosed with cancer in the 1990s compared to those diagnosed in the 1970s makes it 
difficult to definitively determine the impact of risk factors on later self-reported health 
status without considering their impact on mortality itself. Finally, our evaluation of the 
impact of personal risk factors was concurrent with ascertainment of health status making it 
impossible to determine the temporality of this association.
Improved survival following a diagnosis of childhood cancer is a success story in modern 
medicine. Surprisingly, our data demonstrate lack of improvement in health status among 
childhood cancer survivors over thirty years of changing cancer therapy, an important 
reminder that cancer cure is not without some consequences. Current long-term follow-up 
guidelines are primarily focused on screening for chronic disease and do not give specific 
recommendations for surveillance of perceived health status. Fortunately, there has been 
recent recognition of the importance of patient-reported outcomes as part of curative therapy 
trials (48). These data may be important in providing opportunities to modify treatments 
with extreme toxicity and directing early intervention during survivorship for survivors who 
report adverse health status. Evaluations of associations between changes in specific 
treatment exposures and health status outcomes for individual primary cancer types, and the 
development and validation of risk prediction models to better determine who needs 
screening (52), are important next steps. In addition, because data indicate that risk for
