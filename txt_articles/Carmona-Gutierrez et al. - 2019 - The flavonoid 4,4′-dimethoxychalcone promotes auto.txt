The flavonoid 4,4′-dimethoxychalcone promotes
autophagy-dependent longevity across species
Didac Carmona-Gutierrez et al.#
Ageing constitutes the most important risk factor for all major chronic ailments, including
malignant, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. However, behavioural and phar-
macological interventions with feasible potential to promote health upon ageing remain rare.
Here we report the identification of the flavonoid 4,4′-dimethoxychalcone (DMC) as a natural
compound with anti-ageing properties. External DMC administration extends the lifespan of
yeast, worms and flies, decelerates senescence of human cell cultures, and protects mice from
prolonged myocardial ischaemia. Concomitantly, DMC induces autophagy, which is essential
for its cytoprotective effects from yeast to mice. This pro-autophagic response induces a
conserved systemic change in metabolism, operates independently of TORC1 signalling and
depends on specific GATA transcription factors. Notably, we identify DMC in the plant
Angelica keiskei koidzumi, to which longevity- and health-promoting effects are ascribed in
Asian traditional medicine. In summary, we have identified and mechanistically characterised
the conserved longevity-promoting effects of a natural anti-ageing drug.

 T
he medical and socioeconomic advances experienced in
developed countries over the last century have greatly
extended life expectancy. However, health span has not
increased at the same pace, resulting in the growing incidence and
prevalence of age-related pathologies. Indeed, ageing remains the
main risk factor for all major chronic maladies, including cardi-
ovascular diseases, neurodegeneration and cancer1. Since the
majority of ageing people are polymorbid, even considerable
advances against a single age-related disease may only marginally
improve health span. Therefore, tackling age-onset diseases by
targeting their commonality, the ageing process itself, appears the
most expedient approach. To date, only a few efficient dietary or
pharmacological anti-ageing interventions exist; these include
calorie restriction (the permanent reduction of total caloric intake
without malnutrition) and administration of pro-longevity drugs
like spermidine, rapamycin, metformin, NAD+ precursors, or
resveratrol2,3. Further approaches that are able to regress (or at
least delay) the onset of pathogenic age-related decline are
urgently needed.
Interestingly, epidemiological studies suggest that the regular
consumption of polyphenol-rich foods may decrease the risk of
many chronic conditions4, and certain polyphenols—most pro-
minently resveratrol—have been shown to extend life and/or
health span in several model organisms ranging from yeast to
mice5.
Polyphenols
are
phytochemicals
widely
dispersed
throughout the plant kingdom with manifold functions in planta
ranging from pollinator attraction to pathogen and UV protec-
tion. Among them, the flavonoids represent the largest poly-
phenol subgroup and many of them show anti-inflammatory,
anti-carcinogenic, anti-neurodegenerative and general cytopro-
tective properties6,7. However, reports specifically addressing the
long-term effects of chemically defined flavonoids on ageing
remain rare.
Most if not all behavioural, nutritional, pharmacological, and
genetic manipulations that are known to extend lifespan stimulate
macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy). In fact,
autophagy seems to be a causal effector of these protective
characteristics. For instance, the longevity drugs resveratrol,
rapamycin, and spermidine, all lose their efficacy when autophagy
is suppressed2. Autophagy is an intracellular recycling process, in
which damaged or superfluous macromolecules and organelles
are sequestered in two-membraned vesicles (autophagosomes)
and then targeted to lysosomes for bulk degradation8. This
facilitates the supply of recycled components for biosynthesis and
thus contributes to cytoplasmic renewal and consequent cellular
rejuvenation.
Conversely,
impairment
or
dysregulation
of
autophagic function results in age-related pathologies9,10. Alto-
gether, autophagy is largely associated with cytoprotection and
overall health.
Here we report the identification of the flavonoid 4,4′-dime-
thoxychalcone (DMC) as a natural autophagy inducer with
phylogenetically conserved anti-ageing properties. We found that
administration of DMC promotes cytoprotection and autophagy
across species and that autophagy induction is required for the
beneficial effects of this compound. Autophagy activation by
DMC depends on specific GATA transcription factors, but not on
the TORC1 kinase, a major regulatory instance of autophagy.
This suggests synergistic potential with other anti-ageing inter-
ventions that do rely on TORC1 signalling.
Results
4,4′-dimethoxychalcone (DMC) promotes longevity across
species. In an effort to identify novel natural compounds with
anti-ageing properties, we screened a library of 180 compounds
representing different subclasses of flavonoids (Supplementary
Table 1) for their ability to counteract age-related cellular demise.
For this purpose, we monitored cellular health during yeast
chronological ageing—an established model for the ageing of
human post-mitotic cells11–13—in the presence of each of these
flavonoids at a concentration of 50 µM. Using a high-throughput
approach (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1a–e), we determined in
parallel (i) cellular membrane integrity (survival) by means of
propidium iodide (PI) staining (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1d),
(ii) the clonogenic potential (outgrowth) of aged cells (Fig. 1b,
Supplementary Fig. 1e), and (iii) the production of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) detectable as the ROS-driven conversion of
dihydroethidium to fluorescent ethidium (Fig. 1c). In each of
these three independent assays, DMC emerged as a top cyto-
protective hit. Upon further determining the concentration
dependency of DMC’s rescuing effect, we established the optimal
dose in yeast to be at 100 µM (Supplementary Fig. 2a). DMC’s
potential to reduce chronological age-related cell death (as
assessed by PI staining) was thereby comparable to that of several
compounds previously reported as cytoprotective in ageing
models. Precisely, DMC partly outperformed other polyphenols,
including resveratrol and specific flavonoids (at 100 µM, as
DMC), and yielded a similar protective capacity as rapamycin (at
its optimal dosage of 40 nM) (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Con-
firming and extending our screening results, DMC treatment
reduced the age-related increase in apoptotic and necrotic cell
populations as determined by AnnexinV/PI co-staining, dimin-
ished the population of ROS-accumulating cells and promoted
clonogenicity during ageing (Fig. 1d–f, Supplementary Fig. 2c, d).
We next examined whether DMC would act as an anti-ageing
compound in two multicellular organisms, namely, the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.
Remarkably, chronic DMC treatment (41.6 µM for worms, 200
µM for flies) prolonged the median lifespan of both model
organisms by approximately 20% (Fig. 1g, h, Supplementary
Fig. 3a–k, Supplementary Table 2). Of note, DMC did neither
affect
food
intake (Supplementary
Fig. 4a) nor fecundity
(Supplementary Fig. 4b) of flies, and its longevity-extending
effects were independent of the food composition (Supplementary
Fig. 4c–e). DMC (50 µM) also largely prevented the senescence-
mediated decrease of clonogenic survival in highly confluent
human cells (U2OS osteosarcoma, HeLa cervical carcinoma,
and H4 neuroblastoma cells) (Fig. 1i, j, Supplementary Fig. 3l).
Altogether, these results suggest that DMC mediates phylogen-
etically conserved anti-ageing effects.
Autophagy is required for the beneficial effects of DMC. Most
anti-ageing interventions depend on autophagy to exert their
protective properties2, and several flavonoids have been reported
to stimulate autophagy14. Thus, we tested whether DMC would
activate autophagy. Indeed, in yeast cells subjected to chron-
ological ageing, DMC increased the autophagy-dependent redis-
tribution of a GFP-Atg8 fusion protein towards vacuoles and its
subsequent degradation to yield free GFP (Fig. 2a–c, Supple-
mentary Fig. 5a–c). Moreover, DMC treatment stimulated the
activity of Pho8ΔN60, a truncated form of alkaline phosphatase
(ALP), the vacuolar delivery and activation of which depends on
autophagy15,16 (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. S5d, e). In worms,
DMC feeding for 48 h resulted in increased formation of autop-
hagosomes as indicated by microscopic analysis of mCherry-fused
LGG-1, the worm homologue of Atg8 (Fig. 2e, f). Moreover,
brains of aged flies fed with DMC for 30 days exhibited reduced
abundance of Ref(2)P, the fly homologue of human sequestosome-
1 (SQSTM1/p62), suggesting increased autophagic flux, which
generally leads to reduced abundance of Ref(2)P17 (Fig. 2g, h).
Similarly, DMC induced autophagic flux in several human cell

determined by immunochemical detection of LC3 lipidation
(LC3-II) and microscopic detection of cytoplasmic GFP-LC3 dots
in the absence or presence of chloroquine, which stalls lysosomal
autophagosome degradation (Fig. 2i, j, Supplementary Fig. 6a–h).
In addition, DMC caused a reduction of SQSTM1/p62 levels in
HCT116 and HepG2 cells (Supplementary Fig. 6i–k). Finally,
DMC administered intraperitoneally efficiently triggered autop-
hagic flux in the heart and liver from wild type (WT) C57BL/6
mice, as shown by increased LC3 lipidation, even after leupeptin
treatment,
a
lysosomal
protease
inhibitor
(Fig.
3a,
b,
Supplementary Fig. 6l, m). In conclusion, DMC induces autop-
hagic flux in all model systems tested from yeast to mammals.
We next examined a possible causality between the induction
of autophagy and the protective effects of DMC. DMC reduced
the infarction area in mice subjected to prolonged myocardial
ischemia (with no reperfusion), an autophagy-associated and
ageing-relevant setting18–20, but only in wild type animals and
not in mice with cardiac-specific autophagy deficiency (Fig. 3c, d,
Supplementary
Fig.
6n).
Importantly,
this
dependence
on
autophagy also held true for the longevity phenotype. The

of
the

machinery, abolished DMC-mediated lifespan extension in yeast,
worms, and flies (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 7a–h). Altogether,
this indicates that autophagy induction is indeed necessary for the
beneficial effects of DMC.
DMC targets the yeast GATA transcription factor Gln3. Next,
we asked via which pathway(s) DMC might promote autophagy.
DMC did neither impair proteasome activity nor induce endo-
plasmic reticulum stress (Supplementary Fig. 8a, b), thus ruling
out two possible xenobiotic-mediated, pro-autophagic routes21–23.
We then decided to examine the anti-ageing effects of DMC in
several yeast mutants deficient for genes/proteins known to be
involved in autophagic signalling24 (Fig. 5a). The disruption of the
GATA transcription factor GLN325 was the genetic intervention
that most prominently abated DMC-mediated cytoprotection
(Fig. 5a, b, Supplementary Fig. 8c, d). Of note, this phenotype

 could be reversed by episomal Gln3 expression (Supplementary
Fig. 8e, f), indicating that the observed effects were functionally
linked to the deletion. DMC-mediated cytoprotection was also
abrogated upon disruption of the Gln3 regulator protein phos-
phatase 2A (PP2A), either by deletion of its catalytic (PPH21/
PPH22) or one of its regulatory (TPD3) subunits (Fig. 5a). The
three other yeast GATA transcription factors (Gat1, Dal80 and
Gzf3) failed to affect DMC treatment (Supplementary Fig. 9).
Consistently, DMC treatment could not induce autophagy in the
absence of Gln3 (Fig. 5c, d). This suggests a crucial and specific
role of this GATA transcription factor in the execution of DMC
effects.
Gln3 is involved in the co-regulation of general amino acid
control26, and interference with amino acid metabolism has been
linked to lifespan extension and autophagy induction across
species27–29. In accordance with an impact of DMC on Gln3
function, the metabolomic and proteomic profiles of DMC-
treated yeast cells showed a pronounced influence on amino acid
metabolism (Fig. 5e, Supplementary Fig. 10c, f, g). A similar
metabolic repercussion was detected upon metabolomic analysis
of heart and liver tissue of mice treated with DMC intraper-
itoneally (Supplementary Fig. 10a, b, d, e). Notably, the metabolic
imprint of DMC-treated wild type yeast seems to be very similar
to that of gln3 deletion mutants both with respect to the amino
acid profile30 (Fig. 5e) and the metabolome in general (Fig. 5f).
This suggests that the impact of DMC may suppress Gln3
activity. To test this, we monitored the expression of the β-
galactosidase-encoding lacZ gene placed under the control of the
Gln3-inducible MEP2 promoter, which is specifically targeted by
Gln331. In wild type yeast cells, DMC treatment reduced lacZ
activity to levels close to those observed in the GLN3 knockout
strain (Fig. 5g). This further supports the possibility that DMC
mediates its effect by inhibiting Gln3 activity. We reasoned that in
this case, the genetic disruption of GLN3 should per se also
promote cytoprotection and autophagy. Indeed, GLN3 deletion
mutants exhibited decreased age-related cell death and higher
autophagy levels than wild-type cells (Fig. 5b–d, Supplementary
Fig. 8c, d). Thus, Gln3 deletion and DMC treatment have similar,
epistatic effects on yeast cells with respect to autophagy induction
and cytoprotection, supporting the idea that both act on the same
pathway. Altogether, our data argue for an anti-autophagic role of

 Gln3 during chronological ageing that can be suppressed by
DMC.
DMC acts independently of TORC1. We next asked how DMC
might
target
Gln3
activity.
The
classical
model
of
Gln3
cytoplasmic-nuclear
translocation
and
activation
involves
TORC1-dependent negative regulation32. Thus, TORC1 inhibi-
tion, which is consistently connected to longevity33, actually sti-
mulates Gln3 activity and does not suppress it as DMC.
Accordingly, treatment with rapamycin, an inhibitor of the
TORC1 kinase complex with well-established anti-ageing effects,
promoted activation of the Gln3-inducible MEP2 promoter, and
this effect was completely lost upon GLN3 deletion as previously
described31 (Supplementary Fig. 11a). Intriguingly, however,
rapamycin
continued
to
mediate
both
cytoprotection
and
autophagy induction under these GLN3-defective conditions.
Deletion of Gln3 did neither preclude the reduction of age-
dependent cell death (as determined by PI staining) nor the sti-
mulation of autophagic flux (as determined by GFP liberation)
induced by rapamycin (Fig. 6a–c, Supplementary Fig. 11b, c).
These results indicate that DMC and rapamycin mediate cyto-
protection
via
independent
pathways.
Consequently,
the
combinatorial treatment with both agents, which consistently
reduced Gln3 activity compared to rapamycin supplementation
alone (Supplementary Fig. 11d), resulted in additive cytoprotec-
tive effects (Supplementary Fig. 11e). Thus, DMC seems to
operate independently from TORC1. Indeed, neither deletion of
the main TORC1 component TOR1 nor YPK1, a downstream
target kinase of TORC2 involved in the positive regulation of
autophagy during amino acid starvation29, influenced DMC
effects (Fig. 5a). In line, as opposed to rapamycin, DMC did not
influence

(Rps6)
phosphorylation,
a
downstream marker of TORC1 activity (Fig. 6d; Supplementary
Fig. 11f). These data suggest that DMC regulates Gln3 activity in
a manner that differs from the classical TORC1-dependent route.
We further unveiled a functional interaction of DMC with the
Gln3 regulator PP2A. Its genetic inactivation by deletion of both
its functionally redundant catalytic subunits (PPH21, PPH22)
receded DMC effects (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Fig. 11g). These
catalytic subunits can form distinct complexes with multiple
regulatory/specificity subunits relevant for Gln3 regulation. One
of these complexes is formed with the scaffold module Tpd3, the
deletion of which we found to revert DMC-mediated effects
(Fig. 5a, Supplementary Figure 11g), similar to PPH21/22
disruption. Notably, this specific complex—as opposed to the

 one with Tap42—is rapamycin-insensitive34,35, supporting the
idea that TORC1 is not involved in DMC effects. In aggregate,
our data suggest that DMC functionally targets Gln3 in a
TORC1-independent manner.
GATA transcription factors are conserved DMC effectors.
Finally, we tested whether the described dependence of DMC on
yeast Gln3 is phylogenetically conserved. Indeed, silencing of the
C. elegans GATA transcription factor elt-1, a Gln3 homolog,
precluded both DMC-mediated lifespan extension and autophagy
induction in worms (Fig. 7a–c, Supplementary Fig. 12a, b).
Similarly, elt-1 knockout animals treated with DMC did not show
improved survival during ageing (Supplementary Fig. 12c–e).
Intriguingly, in human U2OS cells, siRNA-mediated silencing of
GATA2 (and to a lower extent also that of GATA3, but not that
of other Gln3 homologues), precluded autophagy induction by
DMC (Fig. 7d, e, Supplementary Fig. 13). In contrast, rapamycin-
induced autophagy remained unaltered upon GATA2 silencing
(Supplementary Fig. 14a), again supporting the concept that
DMC and rapamycin ignite independent pathways across species.
In fact, DMC—as opposed to rapamycin—did not inhibit
TORC1 signalling as determined by sustained S6K1 phosphor-
ylation levels (Supplementary Fig. 14b). In aggregate, these results
indicate a conserved role for specific Gln3-like GATA tran-
scription factors in DMC-mediated autophagy and lifespan
extension.
Discussion
While the beneficial effects of certain behavioral and dietary
strategies (especially calorie restriction) are uncontestable2, most
individuals have difficulties to strictly and permanently adhere to
them. This has encouraged the search for potential pharmaco-
logical alternatives. The present work identifies the flavonoid 4,4′-
dimethoxychalcone (DMC) as an anti-ageing compound with
cardioprotective effects in mice and the potential to promote
longevity across species. This echoes prior studies reporting that
chalcones possess a wide—though poorly defined—range of
biological activities relevant to human health6. So far, DMC
has been only reported to mediate a mild anti-malarial (IC50
21.7 µM)36 activity and to inhibit the proliferation of human
K562 leukaemia cell lines (IC50 15 µM)37. To our knowledge,
there is no natural source of DMC known to date. Intriguingly,

 we could detect DMC in the stipes and leaves (but not in the
roots) of the chalcone-rich plant Angelica keiskei koidzumi
(commonly known under the Japanese name of Ashitaba), to
which longevity- and health-promoting effects are attributed in
Asian folk medicine (Supplementary Fig. 15a, b). This fuels the
expectation that DMC may be therapeutically applicable in
humans. Incidentally, DMC seems to be well tolerated in mice
with no apparent side effects or toxicity, at least up to a dose level
of 2000 mg/kg per os during an observation time of 14 days38.
Moreover, we could detect DMC in the blood plasma of middle-
aged mice that were fed with chow containing 0.25% DMC for
7 days, suggesting that orally administered DMC becomes bioa-
vailable in mammals (Supplementary Fig. 15c).
Our data further demonstrate that the protective effects of
DMC are mediated by autophagy induction. Intriguingly, the
anti-ageing capacity of most interventions—independently of
their upstream targets—seems to converge in autophagy induc-
tion. Still, many flavonoids have antioxidant potential that might
mediate some degree of acute cytoprotection separately from
autophagy. For instance, DMC protected mice against hepato-
toxicity induced by acute ethanol intoxication, as measured by
decreased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, in both
wild type and whole body ATG4B knockout animals (Supple-
mentary Fig. 6o). Along similar lines, DMC slightly reduced cell
death during the early phase of chronological ageing in different
yeast strains, were they autophagy-competent or not (Supple-
mentary Fig. 7h). However, at later time points, the anti-ageing
effects of DMC were largely lost in autophagy-deficient yeast
strains. In fact, the antioxidant capacity does not solely determine
the long-term effects of cytoprotective flavonoids, as indicated by
the fact that several flavonoids with powerful antioxidant activ-
ity39 failed to mediate anti-ageing effects in our initial screen
(Supplementary Fig. 2e). Accordingly, other studies have shed
doubts on the exclusive relationship between the health-
promoting and antioxidant properties of flavonoids40.
DMC promotes autophagy via a pathway that involves specific
GATA transcription factors. In yeast, our results suggest that
during chronological ageing, the GATA transcription factor Gln3
limits survival by exerting an anti-autophagic role, and that this
can be reverted by DMC. While a previous genetic high-
throughput study, in which Δgln3 cells were found to be long-
lived41, supports this notion, the role of Gln3 in autophagy seems
to be more controversial. In discrepancy with our data, Gln3 has
previously been shown to promote ATG14 expression upon
nitrogen starvation in the logarithmic phase, raising the pre-
sumption that it might have a general pro-autophagic role42.
However, this work did not measure actual autophagic flux in
gln3-deficient strains, and ATG protein expression levels alone
are not an accurate means to monitor autophagy15,43. In addition,
a more recent study has challenged these observations by not
finding any changes in ATG14 transcription or autophagy
induction in gln3 deletion mutants subjected to nitrogen starva-
tion, although other ATGs seemed to be upregulated44. More
importantly, this latter report also showed that under basal
autophagic conditions in the logarithmic phase, the deletion of
GLN3 (but not GAT1) actually promoted accumulation of ATG8

 and ATG29 mRNAs (ATG14 remained unaffected).44 The
authors of that study concluded that Gln3 must have a direct or
indirect role in the repression of some ATG genes when autop-
hagy functions at basal/physiological levels44. Accordingly, we
observed increased expression levels of different ATG proteins in
ageing Δgln3 cells (Supplementary Fig. 16). While under acute
autophagy induction, e.g. upon nitrogen starvation, Gln3 might
positively contribute to the expression of distinct ATGs44, our
data and the recent literature41,44 are consistent with a role for
Gln3 in restraining cytoprotective autophagy operating at a basal
activity, at least during physiological chronological ageing con-
ditions. We thus surmise that, by interfering with the autophagy-
repressive activity of Gln3, DMC can increase autophagic flux
thus conferring cytoprotection upon ageing.
Both Gln3 activation32 and lifespan extension33 are associated
to inhibition of TORC1. However, we show here that these two
outcomes are correlative, i.e. that Gln3 activation as it occurs
during TORC1 inhibition is not causal for cytoprotection. Simi-
larly, our results support the notion that Gln3 is not required for
rapamycin-mediated autophagy induction, as GLN3 deletion and
rapamycin treatment induce autophagy in an additive manner.
These data suggest, on the one hand, that DMC regulates Gln3
activity TORC1-independently. Indeed, recent evidence indicates
that such non-canonical mechanisms of Gln3 regulation may
exist45–47. On the other hand, it establishes synergistic potential
with other anti-ageing interventions that act on the TORC1
inhibitory pathway. As a proof of principle, we show that DMC
and rapamycin (a specific TORC1 inhibitor) exert additive
cytoprotective effects.
Several GATA transcription factors have been connected to
lifespan control48 in higher eukaryotes, and we can show that—as
in yeast—DMC effects depend on specific GATA transcription
factors in nematodes and human cell cultures. It should be noted
that in worms, silencing of the GATA transcription factor elt-1
did not per se promote organismal lifespan extension (as opposed
to yeast Gln3), although it did increase autophagy in intestinal
cells. This might be due to tissue-restricted effects of elt-1 RNAi
or due to a higher complexity of longevity regulation in higher
eukaryotes through interactions among several GATA family
members49. In mammalian cells, the role of GATA transcription
factors in autophagy is only starting to be elucidated with dif-
fering outcomes depending on the specific factor. Only two
reports have addressed this issue50,51. On the one hand, GATA1
has been shown to promote autophagosome formation and
transcription of genes encoding ATG components in human
erythroblasts, although the effects on different ATGs were rather
heterogeneous50. On the other hand, GATA4 seems to inhibit
doxorubicin-mediated autophagy in rat cardiomyocytes51. Our
data identifies GATA2 as a further family member with anti-
autophagic capacity, at least under the tested conditions.
In the last century, life expectancy has increased globally,
resulting in a demographic transformation characterised by an
increased ageing population. This has greatly boosted the inci-
dence and prevalence of late onset afflictions, which represents a
pressing socioeconomic concern. Thus, it is critical to devise
feasible anti-ageing interventions. The present work establishes
the potential of DMC as a pharmacological instrument against
ageing and age-related diseases. Future studies must explore
whether DMC and/or its chemically defined derivatives can be
advantageously used in humans as well.
Methods
Reagents. The following reagents were purchased from the indicated suppliers:
FITC-labeled Annexin V (Roche Applied Science [11828681001]), diyh-
droethidium (DHE, Sigma-Aldrich, [D7008]), propidium iodide (PI, Sigma-
Aldrich [P4170]), 4,4′-dimethoxychalcone (DMC; ABCR, [AB179040];
Extrasynthese, [1295]; Sigma-Aldrich, [S617237]), rapamycin (LC laboratories, [R-
5000]), resveratrol (Sigma-Aldrich [R5010]). For the initial yeast screen, all fla-
vonoids (including 4,4′-dimethoxychalcone) were purchased from Extrasynthese;
for a complete list including the name, subclass and article number of each fla-
vonoid please refer to Supplementary Table 1. Flavonoid stock solutions were
always freshly prepared in DMSO prior to treatment. Acetonitrile (Chromasolv),
formic acid (puriss), ethylacetate (Chromasolv) were purchased from Sigma
Aldrich (St Lois, USA). Water was purified by MilliQ system (<18.2 MΩcm, Merck,
Darmstadt, Germany).
Yeast strains and plasmids. Experiments were carried out in BY4742 (MATα
his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0) and respective null mutants, obtained from Euro-
scarf or self-generated (Supplementary Table 3) as described below. To monitor
subcellular localisation of endogenous Atg8, a previously reported strain expressing
an EGFP–Atg8 fusion protein was used52. Atg protein expression was determined
using chromosomal 6(HA)-tagged strains, generated using pYM17 as a template53.
All strains were grown on SC medium containing 0.17% yeast nitrogen base (BD
Diagnostics, Schwechat, Austria), 0.5% (NH4)2SO4, 30 mg/l of all amino acids
(except 80 mg/l histidine and 200 mg/l leucine), 30 mg/l adenine and 320 mg/l
uracil, with 2% glucose (SCD). For complementation experiments with Gln3, i.e.
for episomal Gln3 expression, cells were grown on SCD as described below and
upon flavonoid treatment galactose was added to a final concentration of 0.1% to
induce expression. Successful expression was verified via western blot; note that the
double band obtained (Supplementary Fig. 8f) is characteristic for Gln354.
Yeast chronological ageing experiments. Chronological ageing experiments
were carried out in 96-deepwell plates (Bel-Art Products, USA), sealed with gas-
permeable adhesive membranes (Excel Scientific) and lids. Therefore, 500 µl of
fresh media were inoculated with overnight cultures from cellular material of a 4-
day-incubated YEPD plate to an OD600 of 0.1 (~1.106 cells ml–1). Thereby, the
wells at the outer rims of the deepwell plates were not inoculated, since they are
prone to dry out in the course of ageing; instead they were loaded with water. Next,
cells were grown to an OD600 of ~0.2 and subsequently supplemented with either
the indicated concentration of freshly DMSO-diluted flavonoid or DMSO alone
(control), both at a final concentration of 0.2% DMSO. Aliquots were taken out to
perform different viability stainings (PI, DHE, AnnexinV/PI), survival tests (plat-
ing, regrowth capacity)13,55, and/or autophagy assays (EGFP-Atg8, ALP) at indi-
cated time points (Fig. 1a).
For the initial yeast screen, each flavonoid was supplemented at a concentration
of 50 µM. After identification of DMC as a top cytoprotective hit, we determined
the optimal dose for treatment in yeast at 100 µM, at least under the applied
conditions. This was the lowest concentration exerting the highest rescue effect
(Supplementary Fig. 2a).
One of the major causes of yeast chronological ageing might be the excessive
production of acetic acid56. Consistently, yeast lifespan can be prolonged by
alkalinization of the medium52. Of note, DMC treatment did not alter the pH of
the medium (Supplementary Fig. 2f), demonstrating that the cytoprotective effects
of DMC upon yeast chronological ageing are pH-independent.
If not otherwise stated, representative ageing experiments are shown with at
least six independent biological replicates aged at the same time. Experiments were
performed at least three times in total with similar outcome, except during the
screening procedure, where each flavonoid was tested in three to six independent
samples for each ageing experiment.
Assays for cell death markers in yeast. For the initial yeast screen, PI (necrosis)
and DHE (superoxide anione O2- production) staining was performed as follows:
~1 × 107 cells were harvested by centrifugation for 5 min at 2,700 × g and stained
for 5 min with propidium iodide (100 ng/ml in PBS pH 7.4) or dihydroethidium
(2.5 µg/ml in PBS pH 7.4), respectively. Cells were pelleted again for 5 min at
2700 × g and resuspended in PBS. Relative fluorescence units were determined
using a fluorescence reader (Tecan, GeniusPRO) and normalised to the OD600 of
each sample. Then, the area under the curve (AUC) for all monitored days
throughout chronological ageing was calculated and a Z-score computed for the
results with PI and DHE, respectively. The results obtained in these high-
throughput assays positively correlate with the corresponding low scale experi-
ments (Supplementary Fig. 1a–c). Of note, an unstained sample of each well was
tested at day 1 of chronological ageing to take account for possible intrinsic
fluorescence properties of any given flavonoid that might interfere with our
fluorescence-based assays. For the viability assay using outgrowth capacity, which
has been previously used to determine ageing-associated viability41,57, aliquots (9
µl) were taken at day 3 of chronological ageing to inoculate 171 µl fresh SCD media
in 96-well-plates. Cultures (total 180 µl) were grown at 28 °C, 1000 rpm (motor
speed) and OD600 was measured at the point of inoculation and 10 h thereafter
using a plate reader (Tecan, GeniusPRO). Outgrowth was defined as the difference
between the measured OD600 at the time of inoculation and after 10 h of growth
[OD600(10h)- OD600(inoculation)], and then normalised to the DMSO-treated control;
finally, a Z-score was computed. As in the other high-throughput assays (see
above), a positive correlation between outgrowth capacity and viability was
established (Supplementary Fig. 1b).

 Assays for apoptosis/necrosis (AnnexinV/PI co-staining) upon DMC treatment
were quantified by flow cytometry (BD LSRII Fortessa, BD Biosciences). Briefly,
~1 × 107 cells were harvested by centrifugation for 5 min at 2700 × g and washed
once with water and once with buffer B + S (35 mM potassium phosphate buffer,
pH 6.8, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1.2 M sorbitol). To obtain spheroplasts, cells were
resuspended in 330 µl buffer B + S, 15 µl glucuronidase/arylsulfatase (Sigma-
Aldrich, [BGALA-RO]) and 3 µl lyticase (1000 U/ml, Sigma-Aldrich [L2524]) were
added, and cells were incubated at 28 °C for 30 min. Spheroplasts were pelleted at
500 g for 2 min and carefully washed once with buffer B + 0.6 M sorbitol. Then
spheroplasts were resuspended in 30 µl incubation buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4,
140 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.6 M sorbitol) and stained for 20 min by addition of
3 µl AnnexinV-FLUOS (Sigma-Aldrich [11828681001]) and 3 µl PI (100 µg/ml).
For flow cytometry, a total of 30,000 cells per sample were evaluated using BD
FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences). ROS accumulating cells were quantified
evaluated by DHE staining (see above) and subsequent flow cytometry and analysis
of 30,000 cells. For clonogenic survival plating, cell counts of DMC-treated cultures
and controls were measured using a CASY cell counter (Schärfe System GmbH),
and 500 cells were plated on YEPD agar plates and incubated for two days at 28 °C
to allow colony formation. The colony-forming units (CFUs) were analysed using
an automated colony counter (LemnaTech). For each strain, the CFUs determined
for the control cultures were set to 100%, and the survival of the respective DMC-
treated cultures was calculated relative to the corresponding control culture.
Plasmid construction and yeast knockout generation. Single and double-mutant
strains were generated according to a reported method by either employing a gene-
specific URA3-knockout cassette, amplified by PCR using pUG72 as a template58
or using the natNT2 or hphNT1 cassettes of pFA6a–natNT2 and pFA6a–hphNT1,
respectively53. Correct gene deletion was verified by PCR with corresponding
control primers and further checked for consistent auxotrophies. All primers used
are listed in Supplementary Table 4. The plasmid [pESC-His-6(HA)] was con-
structed by digestion with SacI/ClaI and ligation with the 6(HA) fragment
amplified from pYM17 using primers ClaI_6HA_f and SacI_6HA_r. GLN3 was
amplified from genomic DNA from BY4742, using primers GLN3_F (NotI) and
GLN3_R (ClaI) and cloned into the resulting vector using NotI/ClaI restriction
sites (see Supplementary Table 5). Notably, at least three different clones of each
generated mutant were tested for similar response to PI staining during ageing to
rule out clonogenic variation.
Yeast autophagy measurements. Autophagy was examined according to pub-
lished methods by determining either GFP liberation via immunoblot analysis (see
Immunoblotting section) or vacuolar localization of Atg8 through fluorescence
microscopy in cells expressing an EGFP–Atg8 fusion protein52. In addition, ALP
activity16 was assessed using corresponding Pho8ΔN60 cells transformed with and
selected for stable insertion of pTN9 HindIII fragment59: ~3 × 107 cells were har-
vested by centrifugation at 2700 × g for 5 min and washed once with 500 µl H2O.
Cells were resuspended in 200 µl ice-cold Assay buffer (250 mM Tris/HCl pH 9.0,
10 mM MgSO4, 10 µM ZnSO4) and transferred to a pre-cooled reaction tube with
100 µl acid-washed glass beads. Cells were disrupted in a beadmill (Mini-Bead-
beater) in a pre-cooled metal reaction tube rack for 3 × 45 s with 30 s intervals in
between. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min
and the supernatant carefully transferred to fresh pre-cooled tubes. Protein con-
centration was determined using a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad [5000006]).
Cell extracts corresponding to 1–1.5 µg protein were added to a final volume of 550
µl assay buffer (room temperature) and the reaction was started by addition of 50 µl
α-naphtylphosphate (55 mM in assay buffer, pH 9.0). After 20 min at room tem-
perature, the reaction was stopped by addition of 200 µl stopping buffer (2 M
glycin/NaOH pH 11.0). Two hundred microlitres of the reaction mix was measured
in black 96-well plates in a platereader (Tecan, GeniusPRO) at ex: 345 nm, em: 472
nm. To correct for intrinsic (background) ALP activity, control cultures (without
pTN9) were simultaneously processed and ALP activity subtracted.
Yeast TORC1 activity. Cells were grown to an OD600 of 0.2 and treated with either
100 µM DMC or 40 nM rapamycin for 6 h. Three OD600 units were harvested and
proteins extracted (see Immunoblotting section). Rps6 phosphorylation at serine
232 and 233 was detected with a phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (Ser235/236)
antibody60 (Cell Signaling [#2211 S], rabbit, 1:1000) and phosphorylation levels
normalised to GAPDH. As controls, stationary phase cultures of wild type and
rps6aS232A,S233A Δrps6b strains (kind gift from Dr. Tarek Moustafa) were refed
with fresh SCD medium for 1 h before harvest.
Yeast MEP2 promoter activation. MEP2 promoter-dependent lacZ expression
was determined using a beta-galactosidase assay. At the indicated time points, 1.5
OD600 units were harvested, washed once with water and lysed for 30 s in 380 µl Z-
buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 40
mM 2-mecaptoethanol) with 50 µl 0.1% SDS and 50 µl CHCl3 using a beadmill
(Mini-Beadbeater). After addition of 50 µl 4 mg/ml o-nitrophenylgalactoside
(Serva), suspensions were incubated at room temperature and stopped with 125 µl
1 M Na2CO3 when the suspensions turned yellow. Samples were centrifuged for 5
min at 2700 × g and absorption of the supernatant was measured at 450 nm. To
assess the fraction of live cells, aliquots of the cultures were stained with PI and cell
death measured by flow cytometry. Miller units/fraction alive were calculated using
the formula [1000x A450]/[volume in ml*OD600*incubation time in min*fraction
PI-negative cells].
Determination of yeast metabolomic changes. Yeast cells cultured in deep well
plates were treated with 100 µM DMC (or 0.2% DMSO as control) for 72 h. For
each replicate, 5 ml culture were rapidly harvested by microfiltration using 0.45 µm
PVDF-filters, immediately washed with 10 ml ultrapure water, snap-frozen in
liquid nitrogen, and kept at −80 °C prior to extraction. Boiling ethanol (BE)
extraction was performed with 2.5 ml pre-heated BE buffer (75% v/v ethanol, 15
mM ammonium acetate pH 7.5) for 2 min at 96 °C in a water bath with short
vortexing every 30 s. After extraction, the cells’ remnants were pelleted by cen-
trifugation for 3 min at 2500 × g at −20 °C, the supernatant was concentrated by
nitrogen evaporation and dry-frozen. Samples were dissolved in 100 µl LCMS-H2O,
centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 5 min and the supernatant used for LC/MS.
All samples were measured with a LC/MS system from Thermo Fisher
ScientificTM. A Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC setup equipped with an Atlantis T3
C18 analytical column (Waters, USA) was used for compound separation prior to
mass spectrometric detection with an ExactiveTM Orbitrap system. A reversed-
phase ion-pairing HPLC method was used for metabolite separation (adapted from
ref. 61). Tributylamine was used as ion-pairing agent. A 40 min gradient was
applied and 2-propanol and an aqueous phase (5% methanol (v/v), 10 mM
tributylamine, 15 mM acetic acid, pH 4.95) were used as eluent A and B,
respectively (Supplementary Table 6). The injection volume was 10 µl per sample
and an injection loop of 20 µl was used.
Negative ionisation of metabolites was carried out via heated electrospray
ionization (HESI) prior mass spectrometric analysis. For the online detection of the
analytes a full scan of all masses between 70 and 1100 m/z with a resolution (R) of
50,000 (at m/z 200) was used.
LC/MS-data acquisition was conducted with Xcalibur software (version 2.2 SP1,
Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, USA)), Raw data were converted into mzXML
by msConvert (ProteoWizard Toolkit v3.0.5), and metabolites were targeted-
searched using the in-house developed tool PeakScout62. Pure analytes were run on
the same system to obtain exact reference retention times and fragmentation
spectra. Raw data was further assessed with Microsoft Excel 2010. For metabolite
clustering, metabolite areas were normalised to the cumulative signal of all
metabolite areas for each day (the mean signal of each metabolite across all samples
was set to 1) and log2 transformed. PCA analyses were performed using the tool
Genesis 1.7.7 (Bioinformatics, Technical University of Graz). The complete data set
is available in Supplementary Data File 1.
Determination of yeast proteome using SILAC. SILAC (stable isotope labeling
by/with amino acids in cell culture) experiments were performed following pre-
viously published protocols17. Briefly, proteins from labeled yeast cells (Lys0 +
Arg0 or Lys4 + Arg10) treated with 100 µM DMC for 24 h or 72 h were extracted
by glass bead disruption in buffer P (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100,
150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) containing complete® protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche), 1 mM PMSF (Sigma) and HDAC inhibitors trichostatin A (2 µM, Sigma)
and nicotinamide (30 mM, Sigma). Protein concentration was determined using
Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad) and 500 µg from each heavy and light extracts
were mixed and stored at −80 °C prior to MS measurement. For MS sample
preparation, probes were reduced with 1 mM DTT (Sigma‐Aldrich) and alkylated
using 5.5 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma‐Aldrich). Proteins were separated by SDS-
PAGE and digested in gel using trypsin (Promega) at 37 °C over night and the
resulting peptide mixtures were processed on STAGE tips63.
Mass spectrometric measurements were performed on a LTQ Orbitrap XL mass
spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) coupled to an Agilent
1200 nanoflow‐HPLC (Agilent Technologies GmbH, Waldbronn, Germany).
HPLC‐column tips (fused silica) with 75 μm inner diameter (New Objective,
Woburn, MA, USA) were self-packed with Reprosil‐Pur 120 ODS‐3 (Dr. Maisch,
Ammerbuch, Germany) to a length of 20 cm. Samples were applied directly onto
the column without pre‐column. A gradient of A [0.5% acetic acid (high purity,
LGC Promochem, Wesel, Germany) in water (HPLC gradient grade, Mallinckrodt
Baker B.V., Deventer, Netherlands)] and B [0.5% acetic acid in 80% ACN (LC‐MS
grade, Wako, Germany) in water] with increasing organic proportion was used for
peptide separation (loading of sample with 2% B; separation ramp: from 10% to
30% B within 80 min). The flow rate was 250 nl/min and for sample application
500 nl/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in the data‐dependent mode and
switched automatically between MS (max. of 1 × 106 ions) and MS/MS. Each MS
scan was followed by a maximum of five MS/MS scans in the linear ion trap using
normalised collision energy of 35% and a target value of 5000. Parent ions with a
charge state from z = 1 and unassigned charge states were excluded for
fragmentation. The mass range for MS was m/z = 370 to 2000. The resolution was
set to 60,000. Mass‐spectrometric parameters were as follows: spray voltage 2.3 kV;
no sheath and auxiliary gas flow; ion‐transfer tube temperature 125 °C.
The MS raw data files were uploaded into the MaxQuant software version
1.4.1.264, which performs peak detection, label-free quantification, and generates
peak lists of mass error corrected peptides using the following parameters:
carbamidomethylcysteine was set as fixed modification, methionine oxidation and

 protein amino-terminal acetylation were set as variable modifications. Three miss
cleavages were allowed, enzyme specificity was trypsin/P, and the MS/MS tolerance
was set to 0.5 Da. Peak lists were searched by Andromeda for peptide identification
using a Uniprot Saccharomyces cerevisiae database containing common
contaminants such as keratins and enzymes used for in-gel digestion. Peptide lists
were further used by MaxQuant to identify and relatively quantify proteins using
the following parameters: peptide, and protein false discovery rates were set to 0.01,
maximum peptide posterior error probability (PEP) was set to 1, minimum peptide
length was set to 7, the PEP was based on Andromeda score, minimum number
peptides for identification and quantitation of proteins was set to one and must be
unique, and identified proteins were re-quantified.
For enrichment analysis, the DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.7 software,
NIAID/NIH [https://david-d.ncifcrf.gov/], was used employing the following
settings: functional annotation clustering (GOTERM_BP_FAT), medium
stringency, Kappa similarity (term overlap: 3, similarity threshold: 0.5),
classification (initial group membership: 3, final group membership: 3, multiple
linkage threshold: 0.5), enrichment Threshold (EASE: 1.0) The reference proteome
was set to all measured proteins at a given timepoint. For P-value calculation,
Benjamini correction was used. The complete data set is available in Supplementary
Data File 2.
The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the
ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE65 partner repository with the dataset
identifier PXD012108 and the project name: “The flavonoid 4,4′-
dimethoxychalcone promotes autophagy-dependent longevity across species”.
C. elegans strains and maintenance. We followed standard nematode culture
conditions66. Nematode rearing temperature was kept at 20 °C, and animals were
maintained at 20 °C on Nematode Growth Media (NGM) agar supplemented with
Escherichia coli (OP50 or transformed HT115). We employed the N2 (wild type)
and MH4799:elt-1(ku491) IV strains for lifespan assays and the VK1093:vkEx1093
[Pnhx-2::mCherry::lgg-1] strain for autophagy measurements.
C. elegans lifespan assays. DMC-treatment of C. elegans was carried out on NGM
agar plates continuously during the entire lifetime starting as L1 larvae, unless
otherwise specified. All agar plates were prepared from the same batch of NGM
agar and seeded with dried bacteria (OP50), which were previously UV-killed to
avoid interference with the xenobiotic-metabolising activity of Escherichia coli.
DMC (41.6 µM) or an equivalent volume of the solvent DMSO was spotted on
dried bacteria in treatment and control plates, respectively. Spotted plates were
dried overnight at room temperature prior to use. The procedure was repeated each
time worms were transferred to fresh plates. For RNAi lifespan experiments, RNAi
feeding started at L4 larval stage. Worms were placed on NGM plates containing
0.5–1 mM IPTG and seeded with HT115 bacteria transformed with either the
pL4440 vector or the test RNAi plasmid. The dsRNA-transformed bacteria atg-5
(Y71G12B.12), bec-1 (T19E7.3) and elt-1 (W09C2.1) were derived from the
Ahringer C. elegans RNAi library67. All dsRNA bacterial clones were used at a
concentration of 0.9 OD diluted with empty vector-harbouring bacteria, according
to previous studies68.
Survival analysis started from hatching, unless otherwise specified, and was
carried out at 20 °C using synchronous populations of 60/80 animals per condition.
Animals were scored as dead or alive and transferred every day on fresh plates
during the fertile period, and then every other day or every 3 days until death.
Worms were considered dead when they stopped pharyngeal pumping and
responding to touch. Worms that died because of internal bagging, desiccation due
to crawling on the edge of the plates, or gonad extrusion were scored as censored.
These animals were included in lifespan analyses up to the point of censorship.
Note that due to the rather high biological variance associated with ageing
experiments, replicates of survival assays are shown as separate experiments; for
details, see Supplementary Table 2.
C. elegans autophagy measurements. To quantify autophagy induction, the
VK1093:vkEx1093 [Pnhx-2::mCherry::lgg-1] strain was used. Worms were treated
with 41.6 µM DMC from the L1 stage for 48 h. For silencing experiments, worms
were transferred as L4 on the respective plates (control and corresponding RNAi ±
DMC). After 24 h of silencing the (adult) worms were acquired using a fluores-
cence microscope.
Using ImageJ, [http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/], the pictured worms were manually
selected and the number of foci counted, using the automated function in ImageJ
“Analyze Particles” on the adjusted images. To avoid artifacts, all the pictures were
acquired and adjusted using the same settings.
D. melanogaster strains and media. We used Drosophila melanogaster w1118 or
Atg7−/− flies. The latter were generated by crossing Atg7d77/+ virgins with
Atg7d14/+ male flies69, both isogenised to w1118. Fly experiments were performed
using two different media: (i) CSY, containing 1% agar (BD) 1% Bacto™ yeast
extract (BD), 5% sucrose (Roth), 0.8% cornmeal, 0.03% (v/v) propionic acid and
0.3% (v/v) 4-hydroxybenzoate solution (Sigma-Aldrich, 100 g/l in 100% ethanol),
or (ii) Bloomington cornmeal-molasses medium, containing 0.8% agar, 0.75% dry
baker’s yeast, 0.83% soy meal, 8.5% sugar beet syrup, 6.7% corn meal, 0.0525% (v/
v) propionic acid and 0.42% 4-hydroxybenzoate solution (310 g/l in 100% ethanol).
For both media, propionic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoate were added when the food
had cooled down to 60 °C. DMC was added at 40 °C at a final concentration of 200
µM and a DMSO concentration of 0.1%. Food was stored at 4 °C for no longer than
1 week.
D. melanogaster lifespan analyses. Flies were reared in standard wide plastic vials
with plugs and hatched for three days until they were collected, allowed to mate for
24 h and then sexed under CO2 anaesthesia and sorted into portions of 20 flies with
a maximal, total anaesthesia time of 6 min. For brain immunofluorescence, flies
were anesthetised for no longer than 2 min. On CSY, flies were transferred to fresh
food three times a week, on Bloomington cornmeal-molasses medium every other
day. Accidentally escaped flies were censored. All ageing experiments were carried
out in climate chambers at 25 °C and 70% humidity with a 12 h/12 h light/dark
cycle. Note that due to the rather high biological variance associated with ageing
experiments, replicates of survival assays are shown as separate experiments; for
details, see Supplementary Table 2.
Fly food consumption assay. Feeding behaviour was determined by capillary
feeding assays. Briefly, plastic fly vials were filled with 3 ml 1% agar and three small
air holes were introduced into the vial wall with a hot syringe. Vials were sealed
with Parafilm (Bemis NA) and rubber caps, containing two additional air holes for
ventilation and two holes for 5 µl glass capillaries (Hirschmann). Four female flies
per vial were accustomed to the feeding procedure for 2 days. Then, feeding of the
test food (2.5% yeast extract, 2.5% sucrose and 200 µM DMC or respective amount
of DMSO) was monitored over three consecutive 10–15 h intervals. Five inde-
pendent vials per condition were analysed and feeding behaviour expressed as µl
food*fly−1*12 h−1.
Fly fecundity assay. Flies (1–4 days old) were transferred to new vials and allowed
to mate for 48 h before sorting them into portions of 10 female animals under CO2
anaesthesia. Flies were aged on Bloomington food containing 200 μM DMC or
control food. At the indicated time points, flies were transferred to fresh food for
16 h and subsequently first instar larvae and eggs were counted. In total, six
independent vials per condition were analysed.
Fly autophagy measurements. w1118 flies were reared on Bloomington cornmeal-
molasses medium, containing 0.47% agar, 0.75% dry baker’s yeast, 0.83% soy meal,
8.5% sugar beet syrup, 6.7% corn meal, 0.0525% (v/v) propionic acid and 0.42% 4-
hydroxybenzoate solution (310 g/l in 100% ethanol) and allowed to hatch for
2 days. Then flies were transferred to new vials and allowed to mate for 24 h.
Portions of 20 female flies were sorted under CO2 anaesthesia with a maximal
anaesthesia of 2 min and transferred to small vials containing control food (0.1%
DMSO) or food supplemented with 200 µM DMC, both containing 1% agar. Flies
were transferred to fresh vials every other day and aged for 3 (young) or 30 days
(old) at 25 °C and 70% humidity with a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle.
Brains from 30-days old female flies were dissected and collected in ice cold
haemolymph-like saline (HL-3) solution. Following fixation in phosphate buffered
saline containing 0.7% Triton X-100 (PBS-T) and 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min
and several washing steps in PBS-T, unspecific antibody binding sites were blocked
with 10% normal goat serum. Brains were incubated with a polyclonal anti-Ref(2)P
(Rabbit, gift from Dr. Gabor Juhasz, 1:8000) antibody for 48 h, washed six times,
and subsequently incubated with the corresponding Alexa 488-linked secondary
antibody (Rabbit, Invitrogen, [#A11034], 1:500) for another 16 h. 11–12 brains of
each condition were stored in VectaShield (Vector Laboratories LTD.,
Peterborough, United Kingdom) in glass-bottom petri dishes at 4 °C and scanned
by confocal microscopy within 2–4 weeks.
Spatial image data was generated using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope with
spectral detection (Leica Microsystems, Inc.) and a HCX IRAPO L 25x/0.95 NA
water immersion objective. Z-stacks were acquired using a resonant scanner (8000
Hz, 8× line averaging, 1024 × 1024 pixels). Alexa 488 fluorescence was excited at
488 nm and emission detected at 500–550 nm. Image noise was reduced by image
deconvolution (Huygens Pro, SVI B.V.; optimised maximum-likelihood estimation
approach; five iterations). Processed z-stacks were projected using the maximum-
intensity projection method. Image analysis of projections was performed using
ImageJ software, [http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/]. The central brain region of 11–12
brains per condition was selected manually with the free-hand tool, and the average
grey value related to the selected area of each brain was measured.
Cell culture conditions and cell lines. Culture media and supplements for cell
culture were purchased from Gibco-Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA) and plastic-
ware from Corning (Corning, NY, USA). Human osteosarcoma U2OS cells (cell
line was purchased from ATCC [HTB-96]) and their GFP-LC3-expressing deri-
vatives were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% foetal bovine serum, 100
mg/l sodium pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES buffer, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium
and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulphate (37 °C, 5% CO2). Human hepatocellular
carcinoma HepG2 cells (cell line was purchased from ATCC [HB8065]) were
cultured in EMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 mg/l
sodium pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES buffer, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium and 100

 μg/ml streptomycin sulphate. Human colorectal cancer HCT116 cells (cell line was
purchased from ATCC [CCL-247]) were cultured in McCoy’s medium enriched
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 mg/l sodium pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES buffer,
100 units/ml penicillin G sodium and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. For autop-
hagy induction, cells were treated for 8 h with 50 μM DMC (Sigma Aldrich
[S617237]) in presence or absence of 50 μM chloroquine (Sigma Aldrich [C6628])
to properly assess autophagic flux.
Cell culture autophagy measurements by automated microscopy. GFP-LC3
U2OS cells were generated by transfection of U2OS cells with pEGFP-LC3 plasmid
and were maintained by selection with Neomycin. GFP-LC3 HCT116 cells were
generated by transfection with lentiviral GFP-LC3 construct (Millipore [17-
10193]). U2OS or HCT116 cells stably expressing GFP-LC3 were seeded in 96-well
or 384-well imageing plates (Greiner) 24 h before stimulation. Cells were treated
with DMC for 8 h, in presence or absence of Chloroquine (for 2 h before fixation).
Subsequently, cells were fixed with 4% PFA and counterstained with 10 μM
Hoechst 33342. Images were acquired using a BD pathway 855 automated
microscope (BD Imageing Systems, San José,USA) equipped with a 40X objective
(Olympus, Center Valley, USA) coupled to a robotised Twister II plate handler
(Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, USA). Images were analysed for the presence of
GFP-LC3 dots in the cytoplasm by means of the BD Attovision software (BD
Imageing Systems). Cell surfaces were segmented and divided into cytoplasmic and
nuclear regions according to manufacturer standard proceedings. RB 2x2 and
Marr–Hildreth algorithms were used to recognise cytoplasmic GFP-LC3 positive
dots. For siRNA analyses, U2OS cells stably expressing GFP-LC3 were transfected
with scramble siRNA (siCtr) or siRNAs targeting GATA1 (siGATA1), GATA2
(siGATA2), GATA3 (siGATA3), GATA4 (siGATA4), GATA5 (siGATA5),
GATA6 (siGATA6), TRPS1 (siTRPS1) and Atg5 (siAtg5) (3 individual siRNA
sequences per each gene, see Table 5) for 48 h, followed by 50 µM DMC (or 10 µM
rapamycin) or being kept in control condition for additional 6 h. Thereafter, cells
were fixed and autophagy measured as described above. For quantification, the
mean value and SEM from the data of all three individual siRNA sequences were
calculated. Knockdown efficiency was verified by western blot analysis (Supple-
mentary Figure 13).
Yeast-like chronological senescence assay. The assay was performed as
described in Leontieva et al70. In brief, 80,000 cells were seeded into 96-well plates
and left untreated or treated with 50 μM DMC. After 5 days, dead cells and con-
ditioning media were removed, cells were trypsinised and a 10% aliquot was plated
in fresh medium-filled six-well plates. After 1 week, clones were marked trough
crystal violet staining and counted.
Determination of S6K1 phosphorylation. U20S cells were treated for 6 h with two
different doses of DMC or rapamycin (1 µM). mTORC1 activity was assessed by
immunoblotting and evaluated as levels of phosphorylation of its target ribosomal
protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1/P70S6K1) on threonine 389 using a phospho-
specific antibody (Cell Signalling Technology, [#9205]). Rapamycin was used as a
positive control of mTORC1 inhibition.
Plant verification and extraction. Angelica keiskei koidzumi plants were pur-
chased from a local retailer. The plants displayed the morphological characteristics
for the species, including pinnate leaves, serrate, 3-parted leaflets, long petioles with
sheathing and the characteristic colour of its sap. In addition, plant DNA extracted
from snap-frozen leaves was genotypically verified. Therefore, nuclear rDNA
(internal transcribed spacer 1, 5.8S ribosomal RNA gene and internal transcribed
spacer 2) was amplified with primers ITS4 and ITS5 (Supplementary Table 5) and
the product sequenced using the same primers (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Ger-
many). Comparison to GenBank accession no. GU395158.1 confirmed the geno-
type for Angelica keiskei koidzumi.
For detection of DMC in Angelica keiskei koidzumi, fresh plant material (~2 g of
roots and stipes/leaves, respectively) was harvested, cut in 5 × 5 mm pieces, snap-
frozen and pulverised with pre-cooled steel beads in a bead mill (mini-beadbeater,
Biospec Products). Plant powder was dry-frozen and kept at −80 °C for at least 24
h prior to extraction (for extraction procedure, refer to “Extractions and
measurements of DMC”).
Mouse husbandry and serum preparation. Male C57BL/6 mice were purchased
from Janvier Labs, France. Treatment of animals started at an age of 12 months. All
mice were kept and treated in accordance with national and European ethical
regulations (Directive 2010/63/EU) and the experiments approved by the
responsible government agency (Bundesministerium für Wissenschaft, Forschung
und Wirtschaft, BMWFW, Austria). Mice were fed ad libitum with regular food
(pellets, Ssniff, Germany) supplemented with 0.25% DMC for 7 days. Animal
physical activity, exploration, defecation, food and water intake as well as body
weight was carefully monitored to ensure normal behaviour. At the end of the
experiment, the animals were anaesthetised by isoflurane inhalation and sacrificed.
Plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and kept at
−80 °C prior to extraction.
For mouse autophagy measurements, 6-week-old male wild type C57BL/6 or
Atg4b−/− mice (Harlan, France) were used. Animal experiments were in
compliance with the EU Directive 63/2010 and protocol APAFIS #10511-
2017070511526660 v2 was approved by the Ethical Committee of the CRC (CEEA
no. 5, registered at the French Ministry of Research). Atg4b−/− mice were kindly

Mice were housed in a temperature-controlled environment with 12 h light/
dark cycles and received food and water ad libitum. Mice were injected
intraperitoneally with a single 100 mg/kg dose of DMC, dissolved in 50 µl DMSO,
and 30 mg/kg of Leupeptin (2 h prior to sacrifice) and 6 h later were sacrificed.
Tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenised (two cycles of 20 s at
5500 rpm [motor speed]) using Precellys 24 tissue homogenator (Bertin
Technologies, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France) in a 20 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4)
containing 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM EDTA and Complete®
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany). Tissue
extracts were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C and supernatants were collected.
Protein concentration in the supernatants was evaluated by the bicinchoninic acid
technique (BCA protein assay kit, Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, USA).
For prolonged ischemia in vivo, 3-month-old male C57BL/6J wild type or Atg7
cardiac-specific knockout (Atg7cKO) mice were obtained from the Jackson
Laboratory. All mice were kept and treated in accordance with national ethical
regulations (IACUC protocol #17022) and the experiments approved by the
responsible institutional agency (Rutgers-New Jersey Medical School’s Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee). Mice were housed in a temperature-controlled
environment with 12-h light/dark cycles where they received food and water ad
libitum. Three-month-old C57BL/6 J mice were anesthetised by intraperitoneal
injection of pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg). A rodent ventilator (Minivent;
Harvard Apparatus Inc.) was used with 65% oxygen. The animals were kept warm
using heat lamps. Rectal temperature was monitored and maintained between 36.8
and 37.2 °C. The chest was opened by a horizontal incision at the fourth intercostal
space. Ischemia was achieved by ligating the anterior descending branch of the left
coronary artery (LAD) using an 8-0 prolene suture 2 mm below the border between
the left atrium and LV. Ischemia was confirmed by ECG change (ST elevation) and
colour change of myocardium. When recovered from anaesthesia, the mice were
returned to their cages. They were housed in a climate-controlled environment.
Determination of metabolic changes in mice heart and liver. Animals were
treated as described for mouse autophagy measurements (see “Mouse husbandry
and serum preparation” section). All standard and reactives used were from Sigma-
Aldrich except ammonium carbonate (VWR). For sample preparation of liver and
heart tissue, about 30 mg of tissues for each condition were first weighted and
solubilised into 1.5 ml polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes with ceramic beads
with 1 ml of cold lysate buffer (MeOH/Water/Chloroform, 9/1/1, −20 °C). They
were then homogenised three times for 20 s at 5,500 rpm (motor speed) using
Precellys 24 tissue homogenator (Bertin Technologies, Montigny-le-Bretonneux,
France), followed by a centrifugation (10 min at 15000 × g, 4 °C). Then upper phase
of the supernatant was split in two parts: the first 270 µl used for the Gas Chro-
matography coupled by Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) experiment in microtubes
centrifugation, the others 250 µl used for the Ultra High Pressure Liquid Chro-
matography coupled by Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC/MS) experimentations.
Concerning the GC-MS aliquots, 150 µl were transferred from the microtube
centrifugation to a glass tube and evaporated. 50 µl of methoxyamine (20 mg/ml in
pyridine) was added on dried extracts, then stored at room temperature in dark, for
16 h. The day after, 80 µl of MSTFA was added and final derivatization occurred at
40 °C for 30 min. Samples were then transferred in vials and directly injected into
GC-MS.
Concerning the LC-MS aliquots, the collected supernatant was evaporated in
microcentrifuge tubes at 40 °C in a pneumatically-assisted concentrator (Techne
DB3, Staffordshire, UK). The LC-MS dried extracts were solubilised with 450 µl of
MilliQ water and aliquoted in three microcentrifuge tubes (100 µl) for each LC
method and one microcentrifuge tube for safety.
Aliquots for analysis were transferred in LC vials and injected into LC/MS or
kept at −80 °C until injection.
For sample preparation of polyamines (liver, heart), about 30 mg of tissues for
each condition were first weighted and solubilised into 1.5 ml polypropylene
microcentrifuge tubes, with 1 ml of cold lysate buffer with 1% sulfosalicylic acid
(MeOH /water 1% SSA, 9/1, −20 °C). They were then homogenised three times for
20 s at 5500 rpm (motor speed) using Precellys 24 tissue homogenator (Bertin
Technologies, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France), followed by a centrifugation (10
min at 15,000 g, 4 °C). Six hundred microlitresof the upper phase of the
supernatant was collected and evaporated in microcentrifuge tubes at 40 °C in a
pneumatically-assisted concentrator (Techne DB3, Staffordshire, UK). The LC-MS
dried extracts were solubilised with 300 µl of MilliQ water, centrifugated (10 min at
15,000 × g, 4 °C), and 50 µl were transferred in polypropylene vial injection for LC
method and the rest was transferred in microcentrifuge tube for safety. Aliquots
transferred in polypropylene vials were injected into LC/MS or kept at −80 °C until
injection.
A number of targeted and untargeted analyses were performed to obtain a
comprehensive picture of DMC’s metabolomic impact. Note that all MRM
transitions for the below methods are available upon request.

analysis. The complete pathway topology analyses are available in Supplementary
Data File 1 (yeast), Supplementary Data File 3 (mouse heart) and Supplementary
Data File 4 (mouse liver).
Measurement of infarct size. Three hours after LAD ligation, the animals were
anesthetised and intubated, and the chest was opened. To demarcate the ischaemic
area-at-risk (AAR), Alcian blue dye (1%) was perfused into the aorta and coronary
arteries. Hearts were excised, and LVs were sliced into 1-mm-thick cross sections.
The heart sections were then incubated with a 1% triphenyltetrazolium chloride
solution at 37 °C for 15 min. The infarct area (white), the AAR (not blue), and the
total LV area from both sides of each section were measured using ImageJ software
and the values obtained were averaged. The percentage of area of infarction and
AAR of each section were multiplied by the weight of the section and then totaled
from all sections. AAR/LV and infarct area/AAR were expressed as percentages.
Ethanol intoxication and determination of ALT activity. Mice were fasted for 6 h
and then they were administered a 33% (vol/vol) ethanol solution at a total
cumulative dosage of 4.5-g/kg by four equally divided gavages in 20-minute
intervals, as described in Ding et al.72. Control mice received the same volume of
water. Vehicle (DMSO) or DMC were intraperitoneally injected to mice 30 min
before ethanol administration. Sub-mandibular blood collection occurred 16 h after
ethanol binge. Hepatic damage was quantified as serum ALT activity (Alanine
Aminotransferase activity) by means of a specific kit (Alanine Transaminase
Activity Assay Kit, Abcam [ab105134]). ALT activity was calculated as [mU*mg−1]
of pyruvate produced in the reaction.
Extractions and measurements of DMC. For DMC extraction of plant samples,
10 mg of plant powder were placed into 1 ml of ethylacetate and the samples
extracted at room temperature for an hour in an ultrasonic bath followed by
another hour on a shaker at 145 rpm (motor speed). Afterwards, the samples were
centrifuged, the supernatant evaporated using nitrogen flow at room temperature
and the resulting residue reconstituted in 100 µl 60% acetonitrile. For DMC
extraction of mice plasma, 40 µl of plasma were precipitated with 150 µl of acet-
onitrile, vortexed, and centrifuged. The supernatant was evaporated at room
temperature under nitrogen flow. The residue was dissolved in 50 µl of 60%
acetonitrile.
All obtained samples were analysed using LC/MS. Experiments were carried out
on an Ultimate 3000 System (Dionex, LCPackings, Vienna, Austria) coupled to a
LTQ Orbitrap (ThermoFinnigan, Vienna, Austria), using an ESI ion source in
positive mode. The system was controlled by Xcalibur Software 1.4.
Chromatography was carried out on a Gemini C18, 20 x5 mm 3 µm (Phenomenex,
Torrance, USA) column using 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% formic acid
in acetonitrile (B) as mobile phase. The separation was performed under gradient
elution conditions: 60% B up to 90% B in 8.5 min, keeping 90% B constant for 3
min and re-equilibrating for 4 min. The flow rate was 200 µl/min at 30 °C, injection
volume 20 µl. For the mass spectrometry measurements 2 scan events were
monitored simultaneously: scan mode in the FTMS and production ion scan of 269
(CID 35) in the LTQ ion trap.
Immunoblotting. Preparation of yeast cell extracts for the EGFP-Atg8 autophagy
assay and expression levels of HA-tagged Atg proteins were performed as descri-
bed17. Therefore, three OD600 units of cells (~1 × 108 cells) were harvested by
centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min, washed once with 500 µl H2O and resus-
pended in 300 µl lysis buffer (1.85 M NaOH, 7.5% 2-mercaptoethanol) and incu-
bated for 10 min on ice. Then, 300 µl 55% trichloroacetic acid were added, samples
were mixed briefly and incubated for another 10 min on ice. The precipitate was
pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min and the supernatant was
removed (followed by a short spin to remove residual supernatant). The pellet was
resuspended in 150 µl sample buffer (200 mM Tris/HCl pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10%
glycerol, 120 mM DTT, 0.004% bromophenol blue), placed in an ultrasound bath
for 5 min and then boiled for 5 min at 95 °C. Before gel electrophoresis, samples
were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min.
Immunoblotting was performed using standard protocols. Blots were probed
with murine monoclonal antibodies against GFP (Roche, [#1814460], 1:5,000 in
TBS + 1% dry milk) or HA (Sigma-Aldrich, [H-9658], 1:10,000 in TBS + 1% dry
milk) and the respective peroxidase-conjugated affinity-purified secondary
antibody (Sigma, [#F-9137], 1:10,000 in TBS + 1% dry milk).
For human cell culture experiments, proteins were extracted from cells by
means of Radio Immunoprecipitation Assay (RIPA) buffer. Twenty-five
micrograms of proteins were separated on 4–12% bis-tris acrylamide (Thermo
Fisher Scientific Inc.) and electrotransferred to Immun-Blot®PVDF Membrane
(Biorad) Membranes were then sliced horizontally in different parts according to
the molecular weight of the protein of interest to allow simultaneous detection of
different antigens within the same experiment. Unspecific binding sites were
saturated by incubating membranes for 1 h in 0.05% Tween 20 (v:v in TBS)
supplemented with 5% non-fat powdered milk (w:v in TBS), followed by an
overnight incubation with primary antibodies specific for LC3B (Cell Signalling
Technology, [#2775], rabbit, 1:1,000) and SQSTM1/p62 (Abnova, clone 2C11,
[#H00008878-M01], mouse, 1:10,000). Development was performed with
appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labelled secondary antibodies (Rabbit-
HRP, Thermo Scientific, [#31460], 1:5,000; Mouse-HRP, Thermo Scientific,
[#31430], 1:5,000) plus the Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). An anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase antibody was used to control equal loading of lanes (for yeast
experiments: the antibody was a gift from Dr. Guenther Daum, rabbit, 1:40,000; for
human cell and mouse experiments: Cell Signalling Technology, clone D16H11,
[#5174], rabbit, 1:10,000). For knockdown efficiency tests of GATA siRNA and
controls (Supplementary Figure 13), the following antibodies were used: Thermo

all immunoblots are depicted in Supplementary Fig. 17.
Statistical analyses. The number of independent biological replicates (n) is
indicated in the figure legends of the corresponding graphs. If not stated otherwise,
independence is defined for yeast experiments as different clones or transformants,
aged separately; for cell culture as separately treated cultures; for C. elegans,
Drosophila and mouse experiments as different animals. Sample size was pre-
estimated based on the effect size observed in initial yeast experiments. There was
no blinding in the experiments. Where normality criteria were met (calculated by
Kolmogorow-Smirnow and Bartlett’s tests), P-values were calculated using Stu-
dent’s t-test (two-sided, unpaired) or an analysis of variance (ANOVA) approach
(for more than two groups), followed by a Bonferroni post hoc test. Non-
parametric data was analysed using a Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple
comparison correction. Where necessary, data was log-transformed to achieve
normality and homogenous variances and significance assessed for the transformed
data. For data with two variables (e.g. treatment and strain) a two-way ANOVA
was performed, followed by testing simple main effects (Bonferroni-corrected
multiple comparisons of different levels of each factor in case of significant
main factor or interaction). Significance of yeast ageing survival data (factors
treatment and time) was tested using repeated measures ANOVA (two-way mixed
ANOVA) with time as the within-subjects factor. For survival analyses, log-rank
(Mantel-Cox) tests were performed between DMC-treated and untreated condi-
tions and the significance threshold was adapted according to the number of
pairwise comparisons. If not stated otherwise, asterisks indicate significance: ***P <
0.001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05. Statistics were performed using Origin Pro 2008
(OriginLab).
