In Brief
Mitochondrial fission protein DRP1 is
decreased in activated glucose-excited
POMC neurons, resulting in increased
leptin sensitivity and glucose
responsiveness and enhanced
hypoglycemic counter-regulatory
response. Mechanistically, altered ROS
levels affect PPARg targets, such as the
KATP channel Kcnj11, which affects
POMC neuronal responsiveness to
metabolic shifts.

SUMMARY
Hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neu-
rons regulate energy and glucose metabolism. Intra-
cellular mechanisms that enable these neurons to
respond to changes in metabolic environment are ill
defined. Here we show reduced expression of acti-
vated dynamin-related protein (pDRP1), a mitochon-
drial fission regulator, in POMC neurons of fed mice.
These POMC neurons displayed increased mito-
chondrial size and aspect ratio compared to POMC
neurons of fasted animals. Inducible deletion of
DRP1 of mature POMC neurons (Drp1fl/fl-POMC-
cre:ERT2) resulted in improved leptin sensitivity and
glucose responsiveness. In Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2
mice, POMC neurons showed increased mitochon-
drial size, ROS production, and neuronal activation
with increased expression of Kcnj11 mRNA regu-
lated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
(PPAR). Furthermore, deletion of DRP1 enhanced
the glucoprivic stimulus in these neurons, causing
their stronger inhibition and a greater activation of
counter-regulatory responses to hypoglycemia that
were PPAR dependent. Together, these data un-
masked a role for mitochondrial fission in leptin
sensitivity and glucose sensing of POMC neurons.
INTRODUCTION
In the CNS, the hypothalamus plays a major role in regulating en-
ergy and glucose homeostasis (Diano, 2013) via the ability of
several neuronal populations to respond to circulating peripheral
signals, including nutrients. The molecular mechanisms by
which hypothalamic neurons are able to sense these circulating
signals and to respond by altering their activity levels have been
the subject of many investigations. Studies from our laboratory
have shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS), a byproduct
of nutrient oxidation, are important regulators of the anorexi-
genic and glucose-sensing pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neu-
ronal activity (Andrews et al., 2008; Diano et al., 2011; Long
et al., 2014). A positive correlation between POMC activity and
ROS levels exists that leads to cessation of feeding and
increased energy expenditure. Indeed, when ROS scavengers
are selectively placed in the mediobasal hypothalamus, feeding
behavior and cellular events associated with fasting, such as
POMC inhibition, are promoted (Diano et al., 2011).
Mitochondria are a major site of ROS production. These or-
ganelles are highly dynamic, for they are able to move and
change their morphology according to the energetic needs of a
cell. Mitochondrial morphological alterations include fission
and fusion (Nasrallah and Horvath, 2014). These processes are
finely regulated by several proteins, including mitofusin 1 and 2
(MFN1 and MFN2) and optic atrophy (OPA) 1 for mitochondrial
fusion and mitochondrial fission 1 (Fis1), mitochondrial fission
factor (Mff), and dynamin-related protein (Drp) 1 for mitochon-
drial fission (Liesa et al., 2009). Fis1 and Mff are located on the
outer mitochondrial membrane and are aggregated in contact
with the endoplasmic reticulum to create a microdomain for as-
sembly of DRP1, Mff, and Fis1 (Hoppins and Nunnari, 2012).
When DRP1, a cytosolic protein, is activated, it translocates to
the outer membrane of the mitochondrion, where it multimerizes,
generating a ring-like structure that constricts and divides this
organelle (Lackner and Nunnari, 2009; Yoon and McNiven,
2001; Zhu et al., 2004). DRP1 activation is rapidly regulated by
the phosphorylation of serine 616 and dephosphorylation of
serine 637, which are targeted by different phosphatases and ki-
nases, including protein kinase A (PKA) and calcium-calmodulin-
dependent kinase (CamK; Han et al., 2008; Wilson et al., 2013).
Recent findings from our laboratory have shown that mito-
chondrial fission mediated by DRP1 is an important mechanism
that enables glucose-excited neurons of the ventromedial nu-
cleus of the hypothalamus to sense changes in circulating
glucose levels and to alter their activity levels, thus affecting

 peripheral glucose homeostasis (Toda et al., 2016). Because
arcuate POMC neurons are also important nutrient-sensing
neurons involved in the regulation of energy and glucose homeo-
stasis, this study was undertaken to examine the role of mito-
chondrial fission regulated by DRP1 in POMC-mediated control
of energy and glucose metabolism.
RESULTS
Decreased DRP1 Activation in POMC Neurons of
Fed Mice
Mitochondrial dynamics have been shown to play a role in hypo-
thalamic nutrient sensing (Dietrich et al., 2013; Schneeberger
et al., 2013; Toda et al., 2016). To further study its role in hypo-
thalamic POMC neurons, we performed double labeling for
POMC and phosphorylated dynamin-related protein 1 (pDRP1)
in fed and fasting conditions. Analysis of the double labeling re-
vealed a significant difference in pDRP1-POMC co-localization
in fasted versus fed states (Figures 1A–1G), with the fasted state
showing a significantly greater co-localization level (Figures 1A–
1C and 1G) compared to the fed state (Figures 1D–1G). These
data suggest that activation of POMC neurons in fed state is
associated with reduced DRP1 activation and, thus, reduced
mitochondrial fission.
Increased Mitochondrial Size in Activated POMC
Neurons of Fed Animals
We then analyzed mitochondrial size, density, coverage, and
aspect ratio in POMC neurons of fed and fasted mice. In
support of the decreased pDRP1 expression and related fission
in POMC neurons of fed mice, we found an increase in mito-
chondrial size (Figures 1H–1K), coverage (Figure 1M), and
cumulative probability distribution of mitochondrial aspect ratio
(AR; the ratio between the major and minor axis of the ellipse
equivalent to the mitochondrion; Figure 1N) in activated (cfos
positive) POMC neurons of fed animals compared to silent
POMC neurons of fasted mice. No difference in mitochondrial
density (Figure 1L) was observed in POMC neurons of fed
mice compared to fasted animals. Non-activated POMC neu-
rons (cfos negative) of fed mice also showed a significant in-
crease in the average mitochondrial area (Figures 1H–1K)
compared to POMC neurons of fasted mice; however, no
difference in mitochondrial coverage (Figure 1M) and cumula-
tive probability distribution of mitochondrial AR (Figure 1N)
were observed. Altogether, these data further suggest that
mitochondrial fusion, specifically in activated POMC neurons,
is associated with fed state.
Selective Deletion of DRP1 in POMC Neurons Alters
POMC Expression, Activation, and Mitochondrial Size
To study the role of mitochondrial fission in POMC neurons, we
generated mice with selective deletion of DRP1 in POMC neu-
rons (Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre) using the loxP-Cre system (Figure S1,
available online). To validate our model, we analyzed and found
no DRP1 expression in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of 3-month-
old Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre compared to controls by immunohisto-
chemistry (Figures S1B–S1G). To assess the effects of DRP1
deletion at the cellular level, we performed POMC immuno-
staining in hypothalamic sections and observed a significant
decrease of POMC immunoreactivity in the ARC of Drp1fl/fl-
POMC-cre mice compared to controls (Figures S2A–S2C) as
well as a significant reduction in POMC fibers in the hypotha-
lamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) (Figures S2D–S2F). No dif-
ference in AgRP fiber staining was observed between the two
experimental groups (Figures S2G–S2I). Electron microscopic
examination of POMC neurons showed a significant increase
in mitochondrial size (Figures S2J–S2L) and coverage (Fig-
ure S2M). No changes in aspect ratio (Figure S2N) were
observed, while a decrease in mitochondrial number (Fig-
ure S2O) was found in Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre mice compared to
controls.
Selective Deletion of DRP1 in POMC Neurons Alters
Energy and Glucose Metabolism
To determine the effect of POMC-selective DRP1 deletion on
the animal physiology, we then assessed their metabolic
phenotype. Three-month-old Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre male mice
fed on a standard chow diet showed an increased body weight
due to increased fat mass (Figures S3A–S3C) compared to both
Drp+/+-POMC-cre and Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre negative male mice.
Since no differences were observed between Drp+/+-POMC-
cre
and
Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre
negative
male
mice,
Drp+/+-
POMC-cre male mice were used in all experiments as control
mice. While no difference in corticosterone levels was found be-
tween the groups (Figure S1H), a significant increase in circu-
lating leptin levels was observed (Figure S3D). Similar data
were obtained from female mice (Figures S4A–S4D). Both in
males and females, the obese phenotype was associated with
increased food intake (Figures S3E and S4E), decreased energy
expenditure and locomotor activity (Figures S3F–S3H and S4F–
S4H), and increased respiratory quotient, specifically in female
mice (Figure S4I). Significant decreases in markers of brown
adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis were also observed in
both male and female Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre mice compared to
controls (Figures S3J, S3K, S4J, and S4K). In agreement with
the observed phenotype, Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre mice showed
glucose intolerance (Figures S3L and S4L) and insulin resis-
tance (Figures S3M and S4M).
Altogether these data suggest that deletion of DRP1 during
development has significant effects on POMC neuronal integrity,
which, in turn, underpinned the altered adult metabolic pheno-
type of these animals. However, these results do not address
the role of mitochondrial fission in the adult functioning of
POMC neurons.
Inducible Deletion of DRP1 in POMC Neurons Does Not
Affect POMC Expression
To bypass the developmental phase, we then generated mice
with selective deletion of DRP1 in POMC neurons using a tam-
oxifen-inducible POMC-cre mouse model (POMC-cre:ERT2;
Berglund et al., 2013), which allows temporal control of cre re-
combinase activity. DRP1+/+-POMC-cre:ERT2, used as control,
and DRP1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice were injected with tamoxifen
(intraperitoneal [i.p.], 0.1 mg/g BW [body weight] daily for 5 days)
starting at 5 weeks of age to induce POMC neuron mature-onset
loss of DRP1 in Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice (Padilla et al., 2010;
Figure S5A). To validate our model, we analyzed and found no
DRP1expression in the ARC of 3-month-old conditional knockout
648

 animals compared to controls by immunohistochemistry (Figures
S5B and S5C). In addition, no pDRP1 staining was observed
in Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice (Figures S5D–S5F). Further
analyses of the mouse model also showed no differences in
POMC cell counts (Figures S5G–S5I) or their projection fields in
several hypothalamic and extra-hypothalamic targets, including
the hypothalamic PVN (Figures S5J–S5L). In addition, over 95%
of tdTomato-positive neurons were found to be POMC labeled
(Figures S5M–S5O). No difference in hypothalamic (Figure S5P)
and pituitary (Figure S5Q) POMC mRNA and circulating cortico-
sterone levels (Figure S5R) was found between the two experi-
mental groups.

 Inducible Deletion of DRP1 in POMC Neurons Increases
POMC Mitochondrial Size, ROS Content, and Neuronal
Activation in Response to Glucose
To assess the intracellular effects of DRP1 deletion in POMC, we
first studied mitochondrial morphology. Compared to control
animals, Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice showed a significant in-
crease in the average mitochondrial size (Figures 2A–2C) paral-
leled by a decrease in the aspect ratio (Figure 2D) in POMC neu-
rons, while no changes in mitochondrial density (Figure 2E) and
coverage (Figure 2F) were observed. In response to a glucose
load, increased ROS levels in POMC neurons were found in
Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice compared to controls (Figures
3A and 3B). Because increased ROS levels were shown to in-
crease POMC neuronal activation (Diano et al., 2011; Long
et al., 2014), we then assessed cfos immunolabeling in POMC
neurons after a glucose load. Compared to controls, Drp1fl/fl-
POMC-cre:ERT2 mice showed an increase in cfos immunoreac-
tivity in POMC neurons 1 hr after the glucose load (Figures 3C–
3G). In support of the cfos data, electrophysiological recordings
showed that while 45% of POMC neurons in control mice were
responsive to changes in glucose levels (5 POMC neurons out
of 11 cells; n = 8 mice; Figure 3H), in Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2
mice 83% of POMC cells were responsive (10 POMC neurons
out of 12 cells; n = 8 mice; Figure 3H). Furthermore, POMC neu-
rons of Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice had a greater membrane
potential compared to controls (Figure 3I), and they showed a
stronger inhibitory response to decreased glucose levels
compared to control mice (Figures 3J and 3K). Potassium ATP
channels have been shown to play a role in POMC glucose
responsiveness (Parton et al., 2007). Next, we assessed the
RNA expression of Kcnj11. Compared to control animals,
Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice had significantly higher arcuate
Kcnj11 mRNA levels (Figure 3L).
Together, these results revealed that inhibition of mito-
chondrial fission in POMC neurons enhances their glucose
responsiveness.
Inducible Deletion of DRP1 in POMC Neurons Improves
Peripheral Glucose Metabolism
Next, we assessed the metabolic phenotype of DRP1fl/fl-POMC-
cre:ERT2 mice and their controls. Contrary to Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre
mice, no differences in body weight, fat, or lean mass contents
were observed between Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice and con-
trols consisting of Drp1+/+-POMC-cre:ERT2 injected with tamox-
ifen and Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 injected with vehicle, up to
3 months of age (Figures 4A–4C). Because no differences were
observed in the two control groups, animals were then grouped
together in all experiments that did not require POMC visualiza-
tion by tdTomato. In that case, only Drp1+/+-POMC-cre:ERT2
mice injected with tamoxifen were used as control.

 No difference in leptin levels was observed in either females
(3.86 ± 0.38 ng/mL in controls versus 3.55 ± 0.65 ng/mL
in Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice; n = 9 and 10 mice, respectively)
or males (4.43 ± 0.87 ng/mL in controls versus 4.50 ± 0.79 ng/mL
in Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice; n = 8 and 9 mice, respectively).
Since selective and inducible DRP1 deletion in POMC neurons
showed a significant change in their glucose responsiveness
(see Figure 3), we then performed a glucose tolerance test. A sig-
nificant improvement in glucose tolerance was observed in
Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice compared to controls (Figure 4D).
While no difference in circulating insulin levels was found during
the glucose tolerance test (Figure 4E), a significant decrease in
glucagon levels was found in Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice
compared to their controls (Figure 4F).
Inducible Deletion of DRP1 in POMC Neurons Increases
Leptin Sensitivity by Enhancing POMC Neuronal
Activation by Leptin
We then assessed whether Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice were
also more responsive to other circulating signals, such as leptin.
Leptin administration at the beginning of the dark cycle induced
a significant decrease in food intake in Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2
mice compared to controls (Figure 4G). In agreement with this,
1 hr after leptin injection, significant increases of cfos (Figures
4H and 4I) and pSTAT3 staining (Figures 4J and 4K) were
observed in the POMC neurons of Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2
mice compared to controls.
Inducible Deletion of DRP1 Decreases POMC Neuronal
Activation and Increases Food Intake in Response to
Glucoprivation
POMC electrophysiological recordings showed that selective
and inducible DRP1 deletion in POMC neurons induced a
stronger inhibition in POMC neurons when glucose levels decline
(Figures 3J and 3K). To assess POMC neuronal activation in
response to glucoprivation, we analyzed cfos immunolabeling
in POMC neurons 45 min after 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) adminis-
tration. A significant decrease in double immunostaining for
cfos and POMC was observed in Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2
mice compared to controls (Figures 5A–5C). This increased
POMC inhibition was also associated with a significant increase
in food intake in Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice compared to con-
trols after 2DG injection (Figure 5D).
Inducible Deletion of DRP1 in POMC Neurons Improves
Counter-regulatory Responses to Hypoglycemia
To further assess POMC responsiveness to hypoglycemia,
we then performed 2DG test with simultaneous measurements
of insulin and glucagon levels. Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice
showed a stronger response to 2DG test (Figure 5E), with
significantly higher glucagon (Figure 5F), but not insulin (Fig-
ure 5G), levels during the test. Furthermore, Drp1fl/fl-POMC-
cre:ERT2 mice showed greater levels of circulating corticoste-
rone and epinephrine (Figure 5H) compared to control mice
45 min after 2DG injection. In agreement with these data,
Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice displayed a blunted insulin-
induced hypoglycemia (Figure 5I). To further analyze their
response to hypoglycemia, we then performed hyperinsule-
mic-hypoglycemic clamp study in DRP1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2
mice and their controls (Figures 5J and 5K). A significant
reduction in glucose infusion rate was required to prevent
blood
glucose
from
falling
below
the
clamped
level
in
Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice compared to their controls
(Figure 5K), suggesting an increase in counter-regulatory re-
sponses in Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice compared to con-
trols. To determine whether a differential hepatic glucose
production was occurring in Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice, a
pyruvate tolerance test was performed that showed increased
circulating glucose levels in Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice
compared to controls (Figure 5L). This was also associated
with increased hepatic G6Pase mRNA levels (Figure 5M),
further suggesting that selective and inducible deletion of
DRP1 in POMC neurons enhances counter-regulatory re-
sponses by elevating counter-regulatory hormone release
and hepatic glucose output.
Inducible Deletion of DRP1 in POMC Neurons Affects
PPARg Expression Levels
We found that inducible deletion of DRP1 in POMC neurons
significantly affected POMC ROS levels, neuronal activation,
and responsiveness to glucose (Figures 3A–3K). Interestingly,
we observed that the arcuate mRNA levels of Kcnj11, the gene
encoding the potassium ATP channel, are significantly elevated
in Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice compared to controls (Fig-
ure 3L). Since we have previously shown (Diano et al., 2011;
Long et al., 2014) that the activation and mRNA levels of the
nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
gamma (PPARg) are associated with POMC ROS levels
and neuronal activation, next, we assessed whether PPARg
was altered in our animal model. Compared to control mice,
Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice showed a significant increase
of PPARg protein levels in punches of the hypothalamic ARC
(Figures 6A and 6B).
Activation or Inhibition of PPARg Affects 2DG-Induced
Hypoglycemia and Kcnj11 mRNA Levels
To further determine the role of PPARg, we then studied the
effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of either
rosiglitazone, a PPARg agonist, or GW9662, a non-selective
PPARg antagonist, on 2DG-induced hypoglycemia in Drp1fl/fl-
POMC-cre:ERT2 and control mice. While i.c.v. injection of
GW9662 45 min before i.p. administration of 2DG showed no
significant effects compared to vehicle injection in control
mice (Figures 6C and 6D), i.c.v. GW9662 administration in
Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice significantly impaired their res-
ponse to hypoglycemia by lowering glucose to levels similar
to those of control mice injected with either GW9662 or vehicle
(Figures 6C and 6D).
Consistently, when rosiglitazone was intracerebroventricularly
administered 45 min before i.p. 2DG, a significant increase in
glucose levels in response to hypoglycemia was observed in
control mice compared to vehicle-injected controls (Figures 6E
and 6F). Rosiglitazone-treated control mice showed glucose
levels comparable to those of Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice in-
jected with vehicle after 2DG administration (Figures 6E and
6F). No changes in glucose levels were found in Drp1fl/fl-
POMC-cre:ERT2 mice treated either with vehicle or rosiglitazone
(Figures 6E and 6F).

 To assess whether administration of rosiglitazone in control
mice or GW9662 in Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice had any ef-
fects on Kcnj11 mRNA levels in arcuate punches, we performed
real-time PCR (Figure 6G). In agreement with the changes in
glucose levels observed after 2DG administration, rosiglitazone
significantly increased arcuate Kcnj11 mRNA in control mice
compared to controls injected with vehicle (Figure 6G), whereas
GW9662 injection significantly decreased arcuate Kcnj11 mRNA
in Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice compared to vehicle-injected
Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice (Figure 6G). Altogether, these
data suggest that deletion of DRP1 in POMC neurons, by
increasing PPARg levels, alters KATP channels, which, in turn,
affects POMC neuronal responsiveness to metabolic shifts.
DISCUSSION
Our findings revealed a critical role for mitochondrial fission in the
regulation of POMC neuronal responsiveness to glucose. First,
we showed that pDRP1 (active form), a GTPase that regulates
mitochondrial fission, is significantly decreased in POMC neu-
rons of fed compared to fasted animals. In agreement with
this, mitochondrial analyses revealed that activated POMC neu-
rons in fed animals have increased mitochondrial size and
aspect ratio compared to POMC neurons of fasted animals, sug-
gesting that mitochondrial fusion may be a required process
for POMC neuronal activation, as implied by previous work
(Schneeberger et al., 2013). To delineate the role of DRP1 in
POMC neurons, we then generated mice with selective deletion
of DRP1 in POMC cells (Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre). In these mice,
DRP1 deletion strongly affected POMC neuronal development
and integrity, as shown by the significant reduction in arcuate
POMC expression, neuronal density, and projections. Drp1fl/fl-
POMC-cre mice showed alterations in their metabolic pheno-
type, displaying increased body weight and fat mass that was
associated with increased food intake and decreased energy
expenditure and locomotor activity. Impaired glucose meta-
bolism was also observed. Strikingly, this phenotype quasi-phe-
nocopied that of mice in which the fusion driver Mfn2 was
knocked out throughout development (Schneeberger et al.,
2013). These observations argue that mitochondrial fission and
fusion mechanisms are critically involved in the proper develop-
ment of the POMC neuronal circuitry.
However, when the activity of the Cre recombinase was
temporally controlled and DRP1 deleted in mature POMC neu-
rons, a differential phenotype was observed. No differences in
body weight and composition were found in Drp1fl/fl-POMC-
cre:ERT2 mice compared to their controls. At the cellular level,
no changes in POMC expression and POMC neuronal number
in the ARC were found between the two experimental groups.
However, an increase in leptin sensitivity and glucose res-
ponsiveness was observed in Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice
compared to controls. These enhanced sensitivities were com-
bined with increased POMC neuronal activation both by cfos im-
munostaining and electrophysiological recordings that was
associated with an increase in arcuate KATP mRNA levels. In
addition, increased mitochondrial size and elevated ROS levels
were found in POMC neurons of Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice
compared to controls. As a result, their response to recombinant
leptin on feeding was vastly affected. In addition to improved
leptin sensitivity, selective and inducible deletion of DRP1 in
POMC neurons improved glucose metabolism in response to
either a glucose load or hypoglycemia by inducing a greater acti-
vation of counter-regulatory responses. In both glycemic condi-
tions, changes in glucagon levels and hepatic output were
observed. Since we have previously shown that changes in
POMC ROS levels are associated with changes in hypothalamic
PPARg (Diano et al., 2011; Long et al., 2014), we then assessed
whether deletion of DRP1 by affecting ROS levels may affect
PPARg in Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice. A significant upregula-
tion of PPARg protein levels was observed in the arcuate
punches of Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice compared to controls.
Furthermore, central inhibition or activation of PPARg affected
the response of Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 and control mice,
respectively, to 2DG-induced hypoglycemia. This was associ-
ated with significant changes of Kcnj11 mRNA levels in the
ARC of control and Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice treated with
either rosiglitazone or GW9662, respectively. Overall, these find-
ings provide evidence for a role of DRP1-mediated mitochondrial
fission in adult POMC nutrient sensing. In addition, our studies
highlight the notion that germline deletion of molecules in control

 of mitochondrial fission unmasks a critical role for mitochondrial
dynamics in neuronal development, but this approach does not
reveal how these processes play roles in adult neuronal func-
tioning and related physiological processes.
Mitochondrial fission and fusion are highly regulated pro-
cesses in which mitochondria continuously fuse and divide to
adapt their morphology and number to the environmental condi-
tions. In mammals, mitochondrial fusion is mediated by mitofusin
1 and 2 and OPA1, which are located in the outer and inner mem-
branes, respectively. On the other hand, mitochondrial fission is
mediated by DRP1, which is located in the cytosol and, when
activated, is recruited to the mitochondrial surface to induce
the fission of the mitochondrial membranes (Lackner and Nun-
nari, 2009; Yoon and McNiven, 2001). Mutations in any of these
proteins in humans have been shown to induce neurological dis-
orders and neurodevelopmental abnormalities (Alexander et al.,
2000; Delettre et al., 2000; Waterham et al., 2007; Z€
uchner et al.,
2004). More recently, alterations in mitochondrial fission or
fusion have been associated with metabolic disorders such as
type 2 diabetes and obesity (Dietrich et al., 2013; Nasrallah
and Horvath, 2014; Schneeberger et al., 2013; Toda et al.,
2016). Thus, understanding the physiological and cellular
functions of mitochondrial dynamics in mammals is of critical
importance to gain insights into the pathogenesis of diseases,
including metabolic disorders.
DRP1 deletion during brain development has been shown to
negatively affect neuronal proliferation (Ishihara et al., 2009;
Wakabayashi et al., 2009). Similarly, we have found that DRP1
deletion in POMC neurons during embryogenesis affects their
development as significant reductions in POMC expression,
number, and projections were found in Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre
mice, thus suggesting that POMC neuronal development
strongly depends on mitochondrial fission. Therefore, to under-
stand the role of mitochondrial fission in mature POMC neurons,
mice were generated in which the temporal control of Cre recom-
binase activity allowed the selective deletion of DRP1 in mature
POMC neurons. Similar to previous reports, we found that selec-
tive and inducible DRP1 deletion in POMC neurons induced
increased mitochondrial size as well as the formation of large
spheres together with an increase in content of ROS in POMC
neurons. While increased ROS levels may have detrimental ef-
fects in several neuronal cell types (Kim et al., 2015), POMC
neuronal activation is driven by a rise in ROS levels (Diano
et al., 2011; Long et al., 2014). Indeed, a significant increase in
POMC neuronal activation was found in Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2
mice compared to their controls that was associated with
increased PPARg and KATP channel expression levels. In associ-
ation with these cellular changes, Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 mice
showed increased leptin sensitivity and increased glucose
sensing to both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. Indeed, cen-
tral rosiglitazone injection to controls significantly improved
while central GW9662 injection to Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2
mice significantly impaired glucose metabolism in response
to 2DG-induced hypoglycemia. In support of a role for PPARg
in improving counter-regulatory responses to hypoglycemia,
PPARg agonists have been shown to amplify counter-regulatory
responses to hypoglycemia in non-diabetic subjects (Gabriely
et al., 2001).
As different cell types have diverse mitochondrial number and
morphology, it is conceivable that the role of mitochondrial
fission and fusion in specific cell types may differentially regulate
various cell types. This may be the case for glucose-sensing
POMC neurons in the hypothalamic ARC and the glucose-
sensing hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus (VMH) neurons.
While in this study we have found that increased glucose levels,
such as in fed state, reduced DRP1 activation in glucose-excited
POMC neurons, our recent study in VMH glucose-excited neu-
rons (Toda et al., 2016) showed that increased glucose levels
activate DRP1, and that this mechanism plays a role in the ability
of these neurons to properly respond to a glucose load.
In summary, our studies revealed that DRP1-mediated mito-
chondrial fission plays a negative role in POMC neuronal re-
sponses to glucose and leptin sensitivity, which further elaborate
on the role of mitochondria in central control of homeostasis
(Horvath et al., 1999).
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
All animal work was approved by the Yale University Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee. Mice were housed at 22�C–24�C with a 12 hr light/12 hr
dark cycle with standard chow (Harlan Teklad no. 2018, 18% calories from
fat) and water provided ad libitum. All mice studied were on the same
background.
Generation of Experimental Mice with a Conditional and/or
Inducible Deletion of Drp1 Specifically in POMC Neurons
We used the cre/loxP technology to generate mice in which DPR1 was selec-
tively ablated in POMC neurons (POMC Drp1fl/fl). We generated mice by
crossing Drp1 floxed mice (Drp1fl/fl; Kageyama et al., 2014) with POMC-cre
that express Cre recombinase exclusively in POMC neurons of the ARC. As
control mice, Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre negative and Drp1+/+-POMC-cre positive lit-
termates were used. All mice studied were on a mixed background (129SvEv,
FVB, and C57BL/6J).
Tamoxifen-inducible cre:ERT2 (Berglund et al., 2013) mice controlled by
Pomc regulatory elements were developed to temporally control cre excision
specifically in POMC-expressing neurons. Founder lines with inducible cre ac-
tivity were screened by injecting 5-week-old cre reporter mice from these lines
(R26RtdTomato + [tdTomato] 3 POMC-cre:ERT2) with a single daily dose of
tamoxifen (0.10 mg/g BW) or vehicle (corn oil) for 5 consecutive days.
The expression of tdTomato in 3-month-old mice was detected in nearly all
POMC neurons (>95%) in the ARC as well as in a small number of neurons in
the brainstem. Recombination was strictly dependent upon tamoxifen treat-
ment, as no cre activity could be detected in the absence of tamoxifen when
Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 were injected with vehicle. Cre activity was also not
detected in other regions of the CNS after tamoxifen injections. Cre-activated
reporter expression was present in the pituitary gland where the Pomc gene
was endogenously expressed. As controls, Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 injected
with vehicle and Drp1+/+-POMC-cre:ERT2 injected with tamoxifen were
used. However, because there were no differences between these two control

 groups, the majority of the experiments was performed using Drp1+/+-POMC-
cre:ERT2 injected with tamoxifen (to visualize POMC neurons via tdTomato
expression) unless otherwise specified.
Immunostaining for DRP1 was routinely performed to validate our animal
models. Perfused (4% PFA) coronal brain sections (50 mm) were incubated
with mouse anti-DRP1 antibody (BD Biosciences #611738, 1:500) for 24 hr

 at room temperature followed by the secondary antibody (biotinylated goat
anti-mouse IgG; 1:250 in PB; Vector Labs) and Alexa Fluor 488 avidin
(1:2,000 in PB; Life Technologies). Immunostaining was visualized using fluo-
rescence microscopy.
Indirect Calorimetry System and Body Composition
Animals were acclimated in metabolic chambers (TSE System-Core Metabolic
Phenotyping Center, Yale University) for 3 days before the start of the
recordings. Mice were continuously recorded for 2 days, with the following
measurements taken every 30 min: food intake, locomotor activity (in the xy
and z axes), and gas exchange (O2 and CO2; the TSE LabMaster System).
Energy expenditure was calculated according to the manufacturer’s guide-
lines (PhenoMaster Software, TSE System). The respiratory quotient was esti-
mated by calculating the ratio of CO2 production to O2 consumption.
Values were adjusted by body weight to the power of 0.75 (kg � 0.75) where
mentioned.
Body composition was measured in vivo by MRI (EchoMRI; Echo Medical
Systems).
Measurement of Circulating Hormones
Serum insulin and glucagon (Bio-Plex Pro Diabetes Assays, BioRad), cor-
ticosterone (ab108821, Corticosterone ELISA kit, Abcam), epinephrine
(MBS700597, Mouse Epinephrine ELISA Kit, MyBioSource), and leptin (Cat.
# EZML-82K, Mouse Leptin ELISA kit, Millipore) were measured following
the manufacturer’s protocol.
Glucose, Insulin, and Pyruvate Tolerance Tests and 2DG Test
Glucose (2 g/kg BW; Sigma-Aldrich), insulin (0.75 U/kg; Humulin R; Eli Lilly),
and pyruvate (2 g/kg BW sodium pyruvate; Sigma-Aldrich, Cat#P5280) toler-
ance tests were performed as previously reported (Kim et al., 2014; Long
et al., 2014; Toda et al., 2016).
2DG test was performed by i.p. injection of 200 mg/kg BW 2DG (Sigma-
Aldrich).
Surgical Procedure for Clamp Studies
Hyperinsulemic-hypoglycemic clamps were performed under conscious and
unrestrained condition in control and conditional knockout mice (Flak et al.,
2014). Under deep anesthesia, polyethylene catheters were inserted into
the right carotid arteries and jugular veins of mice. Lines were flushed daily
with 50 mL heparinized saline for the 3- to 5-day recovery period. On the
day of the study, insulin (Humulin-R; Lilly) was infused intravenously at
10 mU,kg�1,min�1 for 120 min, combined with a variable infusion of glucose
to maintain target blood glucose levels of �50 mg/dL (hypoglycemia). Glucose
was measured every 10 min in whole arterial blood (5 mL) with a glucose meter
(Hemocue). To replace volume and red cells lost in sampling, heparinized
blood cells from donor mice were resuspended in saline and infused intrave-
nously, along with the insulin and glucose, at 6 mL/min. Once the 120 min blood
sample was collected, mice were immediately euthanized under deep anes-
thesia by decapitation.
phospho-DRP1 Immunostaining
Ad libitum-fed or 12 hr fasted mice were perfused with saline following
4% PFA transcardially. Rabbit anti-phospho-DRP1 (Ser616) antibody (Cell
Signaling, Cat# 4494, 1:1,000) and rabbit anti-POMC antibody (Phoenix
Pharmacuticals, 1:2,000) in PB were used for immunostaining and analyzed
with fluorescent microscope as previously reported (Long et al., 2014; Toda
et al., 2016).
cfos Immunostaining
After overnight fasting, mice were injected with either saline (same volume
as glucose) or glucose (2 g/kg, i.p.), and after 1 hr from the injection they
were perfused. In another set of experiments, 2 hr fasted mice were in-
jected with 2DG (200 mg/kg, i.p.), and after 45 min from the injection
they were transcardially perfused. Brain sections were then immunostained
for cfos (rabbit anti-cfos antibody; Santa Cruz, 1:2,000). No staining was
performed to visualize POMC neurons since mice were expressing
tdTomato in this neuronal population, which is per se fluorescent. Sections
were mounted on a glass slide with Vectashield (Vector Labs) and analyzed
with fluorescent microscope.
DHE Administration
ROS levels in POMC neurons were measured by injecting dihydroethidium
(DHE, 1 mg/mL; Invitrogen) through tail vein of Drp1fl/fl-POMC-cre:ERT2 in-
jected with corn oil (as control) or tamoxifen (tdTomato negative) as previously
reported (Andrews et al., 2008; Long et al., 2014; Toda et al., 2016). Two hours
after the DHE injection, glucose (2 g/kg BW) was injected, and 1 hr after
the glucose injection, mice were transcardially perfused. Brain sections
were then immunostained with anti-rabbit POMC antibody (1:2,000, Phoenix
Pharmaceuticals).
Fluorescent images of five to seven brain sections were captured with
confocal microscope and analyzed by imaging software (ImageJ).
Electron Microscopy Analysis
Ad libitum-fed or 16 hr fasted mice were anesthetized and transcardially
perfused with 0.9% saline followed by fixative (4% paraformaldehyde, 15%
picric acid, and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M PB). Brain coronal sections
were either immunostained with anti-POMC primary antibodies (1:3,000) or
double stained with anti-cfos (1:2,000) and anti-POMC primary antibodies
(1:7,000). Ribbons of serial ultrathin arcuate sections were collected on For-
mvar-coated single-slot grids and examined using a Philips CM-10 electron
microscope. Mitochondria morphology in activated (double stained) and
non-activated (only POMC stained) POMC neurons in fed and fasted mice
was measured as previously reported (Toda et al., 2016).
Leptin Sensitivity
Individually housed mice were intraperitoneally injected with recombinant mu-
rine leptin (3 mg/g BW, Peprotech) just before the dark phase and food intake
was measured at 1, 2, 4, 12, and 24 hr after leptin injection. For immunostain-
ing, mice were injected with leptin (3 mg/g body weight, Peprotech) at 9:00
a.m., and 1 hr later, mice were rapidly perfused and brains were processed
for immunostaining for p-STAT3 (1:250 in 0.1 M PB; Cell Signaling Technology)
or cfos (diluted 1:2,500 in 0.1 M PB; Calbiochem) as previously described
(Long et al., 2014; Toda et al., 2016). No staining was performed to visualize
POMC neurons since mice were expressing tdTomato in this neuronal popu-
lation, which is per se fluorescent. Sections were mounted with Vectashield
antifade (Vector Labs) for analysis.

 Real-Time PCR
Total RNA was extracted using Trizol solution (Invitrogen). A High-Capacity
cDNA Reverse-Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) was used for the
reverse transcription. Real-time PCR (LightCycler 480; Roche) was performed
using the following: Mm02619580_g1 for b-actin, Mm00839363_m1 for
G6Pase, Mm00515664_m1 for DIO-2, and Mm01244861_m1 for UCP1
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). The expression of the Kcnj11 gene, which encodes
the Kir6.2 KATP channel subunit, was evaluated in the ARC. The calculations of
average Cp values, SDs, and resulting expression ratios for each target gene
were based on the Roche LightCycler 480 software.
Electrophysiology
Seven- to eight-week-old mice were used and the hypothalamic slices were
prepared as previously described (Liu et al., 2011; Toda et al., 2016). Perfo-
rated patch recording was performed in POMC-Tomato neurons of the ARC
under voltage and current clamp. The membrane and spontaneous action po-
tential were recorded in POMC neurons under current clamp. We recorded ac-
tion potential firing for 4–8 min at a glucose concentration of 2.5 mM. When
firing was stable, glucose concentration was changed to 0.2 mM for 4 min
before returning to 2.5 mM for 6 min. At the end of the perforated patch record-
ings, the membrane of every cell was ruptured and whole-cell patch recording
measured to check current-voltage relationship. All data were sampled at 3–10
kHz, filtered at 1–3 kHz, and analyzed with an Apple Macintosh computer using
AxoGraph X (AxoGraph Scientific). Statistics and plotting were performed with
KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software) and Igor Pro (WaveMetrics). The average
firing rate was calculated in the last 2 min of each glucose concentration. All
the experiments were performed blindly to the electrophysiologist.

Cat# 11 836 170 001) on ice for 30 min. Protein concentrations were measured
using the BCA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 23228 and 1859078). Mem-
branes were incubated overnight at 4�C with anti-PPARg antibody (Santa

Lateral Ventricle Cannulation
A sterile guide cannula was implanted into the lateral brain ventricle (0.3 mm
posterior and 1 mm lateral relative to bregma, and 3 mm below the surface
of the skull) as previously described (Diano et al., 2011).
PPARg agonist (rosiglitazone; Enzo Life Sciences) and antagonist GW9662
(2-chloro-5-nitrobenzanilide; Cayman Chemical Company) were dissolved in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 10 mg/mL concentration. This stock solution
was then diluted 1:10 in saline in order to inject 1 mg rosiglitazone or
GW9662 in 1 mL vehicle. In both experiments, mice injected with the same
volume of vehicle (DMSO in saline ratio 1:10) were used as control.
Two hour fasted animals were given an i.c.v. injection of vehicle, rosiglitazone,
or GW9662, and 45 min after their administration, 2DG test (200 mg/kg, i.p.) was
performed as described above. Mice were killed 45 min after i.c.v. injections,
and the ARC was collected to measure the expression of Kcjn11 mRNA through
real-time PCR, as described above.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were performed blinded to the individual performing the exper-
iment and analysis. Two-way ANOVA was used to determine the effect
of the genotype and treatment with the Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad
Software).
For repeated-measures analysis, ANOVA was used when values over
different times were analyzed. Significant effects were evaluated followed by
Fisher’s protected least significant difference post hoc test with Tukey’s or
Bonferroni’s correction. When only two groups were analyzed, statistical sig-
nificance was determined by unpaired Student’s t test. A value of p < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant. All data are shown as means ± SEM.
