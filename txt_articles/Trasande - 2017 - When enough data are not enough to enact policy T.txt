Abstract
Strong evidence now supports the notion that organophosphate pesticides damage the fetal
brain and produce cognitive and behavioral dysfunction through multiple mechanisms,
including thyroid disruption. A regulatory ban was proposed, but actions to end the use of
one such pesticide, chlorpyrifos, in agriculture were recently stopped by the Environmental
Protection Agency under false scientific pretenses. This manuscript describes the costs and
consequences of this policy failure and notes how this case study is emblematic of a broader
dismissal of scientific evidence and attacks on scientific norms. Scientists have a responsi-
bility to rebut and decry these serious challenges to human health and scientific integrity.
This Perspective is part of the Challenges in Environmental Health: Closing the Gap between
Evidence and Regulations Collection.
Organophosphates are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that were first developed as human
nerve gas agents during World War II but were subsequently adapted as insecticides, as they
were effective at killing insects via the same mechanism but at much lower exposure concen-
trations. Rapid urbanization and population growth accelerated the use of these chemicals in
homes and agriculture. Though use is increasingly restricted in developed countries to prevent
infestations in homes, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, and malathion remain widely used to protect
crops.
Not only are alternative methods available to reduce pesticide use (or at least use less toxic
alternatives) [1], but evidence has rapidly accelerated documenting adverse effects of organo-
phosphate exposure in general, and chlorpyrifos in particular, especially of low-level exposure
in pregnancy and effects on the fetal brain [2,3]. Multiple longitudinal studies have docu-
mented consistent decrements in cognitive function in relationship to prenatal exposure, con-
trolling for multiple other potential predictors, such as socioeconomic status and other

 environmental exposures, such as lead [4,5]. Prenatal exposure has been associated with mag-
netic resonance imaging findings in children, including frontal and parietal cortical thinning
that are consistent with the neurobehavioral deficits identified in psychological testing [6].
Findings in humans are supported by laboratory studies that document not only inhibition
of acetylcholinesterase but disruption of thyroid hormone by chlorpyrifos in laboratory stud-
ies, especially at low levels of exposure [7–10]. Thyroid hormone has long been known to be
crucial for brain development, so much so that thyroid-stimulating hormone analyses are rou-
tinely performed on newborns [11]. During pregnancy, subtle changes in free thyroxine within
the normal range that would not prompt clinically significant increases in thyroid-stimulating
hormone can induce reductions in intelligence quotient (IQ), changes in brain morphology,
and even clinically apparent autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [12–18].
It should be noted that health risks of chlorpyrifos have been raised for decades, resulting in
a ban on household use of chlorpyrifos in 2000. The ban was timely for scientific reasons, in
that it nested a natural experiment within an ongoing birth cohort study at Columbia Univer-
sity in which the research team was studying effects of pesticide exposure on the developing
brain. Before the ban, they found decreases in birth weight and length in relationship to levels
of chlorpyrifos in newborn cord blood. After the ban, as levels substantially decreased, associa-
tions with these strong predictors of adult neurocognitive and cardiovascular outcomes disap-
peared [19]. Given the ethical concerns that exist with conducting randomized control trials
of synthetic chemical exposures, such natural experiments are rare in environmental health
research [20]. Data from this Columbia study provide compelling counterargument to those
who have noted the potential for alternative explanations of the other observational studies
that have been conducted to date. Emerging evidence also suggests prenatal chlorpyrifos expo-
sure may induce tremor detectible in middle childhood [21].
An expert panel recently evaluated the epidemiological and toxicological evidence for
effects of this class of chemicals on cognitive deficits and intellectual disability, using rigorous
criteria elaborated by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Danish Environmental Pro-
tection Agency. They evaluated the toxicological evidence to be strong and the epidemiological
evidence to be of moderate-to-high quality. The expert panel rated probability of a causal rela-
tionship to be quite high, between 70%–100% [22].
Yet recently, United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Administrator
Scott Pruitt denied a petition to revoke all food residue tolerances for chlorpyrifos, calling it
“crucial to U.S. agriculture” and to “ensur[ing] an abundant and affordable food supply for
this nation and for the world” [23]. USEPA had proposed to ban all uses of chlorpyrifos in
2015 [24] and reiterated the need for the ban based upon unacceptably high levels of chlorpyri-
fos identified in food and drinking water and risks posed to women, children, agricultural
communities, and workers [25]. The press release suggested that “predetermined results” had
been improperly used to guide policy. It cites methodological concerns voiced by the federal
advisory committee tasked with reviewing regulatory decisions on insecticides under the Fed-
eral Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, but revisions by USEPA staff had already
been made to resolve these concerns [26]. A less inflammatory Federal Register statement sug-
gests that chlorpyrifos is the only cost-effective choice for some crops [27].
The emphasis of Administrator Pruitt on the need for sustaining the food supply by using
chlorpyrifos in agriculture [23] bears some further comment. While concerns have been raised
about the need for pesticides to proverbially “feed the world,” the evidence for superiority of
crop yield is not as ironclad as some suggest. Context clearly matters, as a recent meta-analysis
of performance comparisons between conventional and organic agriculture suggests, with
equivalent yields under good management practices, particular crop types, and growing condi-
tions [28,29]. Let us for a moment assume that there are no alternatives to chlorpyrifos and

 that it is needed to sustain the global food supply. At the very least, there are serious tradeoffs
to consider in such a decision: is keeping children well fed worth their being less smart and
able to contribute to the future of the global economy? Administrator Pruitt’s statement on
chlorpyrifos is mum on this point.
Researchers at four institutions who led the birth cohort studies did not conspire to select
populations or otherwise design their studies with the intention of finding adverse effects of
organophosphate exposures on child neurodevelopment [30]. Results were rigorously vetted
in peer review by researchers independent of the primary study authors, after successfully hav-
ing their grant applications reviewed stringently by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
through its own separate peer review process. “Predetermined” that surely is not; the use of
“predetermined” should alarm all in the scientific community. In addition, Administrator
Pruitt’s decision fails to consider the reality that the cohort of US children born in 2010 lost 1.8
million IQ points and 7,500 children had their IQs shifted into the intellectual disability range
as a result of prenatal organophosphate exposures [31].
The costs of Administrator Pruitt’s inaction are also substantial for our economy. While at
an individual level an IQ point may not be perceptible except to the keen tools used by the neu-
ropsychologist, a large literature has documented that each IQ point lost translates to a 2%
reduction in lifetime economic productivity [32]. On average, children born in the US today
are expected to have approximately $1,000,000 in economic productivity, after adding up
income over the life course and appropriately discounting for time preference. That equates to
roughly $20,000 per IQ point, not to mention the additional educational and healthcare costs
(among others) associated with intellectual disability. Together, the 1.8 million IQ point loss in
each birth cohort of children will cost the US $44.7 billion annually, assuming future birth
cohorts are exposed at current levels [31]. Chlorpyrifos is but one organophosphate pesticide,
and few epidemiological studies have measured serum chlorpyrifos, instead measuring the dia-
lkylphosphate metabolites common to the organophosphates. Estimates of disease burden due
to organophosphates cannot therefore be parsed to isolate a chlorpyrifos-specific disease bur-
den. Having raised an important caveat, the judgment that chlorpyrifos is the only cost-effec-
tive choice for some crops [27] does not consider a very large societal cost associated with lost
IQ.
So when are enough data enough to prompt policy action to protect the public? Fifty years
ago, during a period of intense debate about the health effects of tobacco, Sir Austin Bradford
Hill gave a landmark lecture on criteria for causation. Clearly, exposure must precede effect
for us to even consider causality. Hill identified additional criteria that should be considered,
such as consistency, exposure–response relations, biological plausibility, effect size, and speci-
ficity. What has been easily forgotten from Hill’s lecture is the need for context in considering
the totality of evidence. The stakes involved clearly matter; Hill used the example of restricting
the use of a drug for morning sickness for pregnant women, suggesting that we might act on
“relatively slight evidence” of harm, as “[t]he good lady and the pharmaceutical industry will
doubtless survive.” Similarly, for an occupational carcinogen, “fair” evidence would be suffi-
cient. He closes by emphasizing: “All scientific work is incomplete—whether it be observa-
tional or experimental. . .That does not confer upon us a freedom to ignore the knowledge we
already have, or to postpone the action that it appears to demand at a given time” [33].
Scientists have a responsibility to speak up when policymakers fail to accept scientific data.
They need to emphatically declare the implications of policy failures, even if some of the scien-
tific underpinnings remain uncertain. There is always some uncertainty in estimating expo-
sures from epidemiology studies, especially where there has been exposure to multiple
organophosphates, for example. In the case of organophosphates, there is still ample evidence
to support a ban given the consistent findings among a large number of epidemiology studies

 as well as laboratory studies, which suggest a modest or perhaps minimal uncertainty of causa-
tion. One could easily replace the example of chlorpyrifos with a host of other synthetic chemi-
cals where policy action remains lagging despite substantial evidence for serious public health
concern. These include brominated flame retardants, phthalates, and bisphenols, just to name
a few, as documented in recent reports by the Endocrine Society [34] and the WHO and
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) [35] on endocrine disruptors.
Scientists who raise their voices should be prepared to face criticism from those who have
substantial vested interests. A response to the WHO/UNEP report funded by CropLife Amer-
ica (a trade association representing the agricultural pesticides industry), the American Chem-
istry Council (ACC), as well as Canadian and European trade associations, published critical
comments, and these were rebutted [36]—that is all for the good. Individual scientists have
been targeted, myself included. A consultant to the ACC and his colleague recently responded
to estimates of the disease burden and cost estimates due to organophosphate pesticides and
other endocrine disrupting chemicals by labeling the evidence for disease causation as “pseu-
doscience” [37]. In these attacks on my colleagues and I [38], funding sources are not stated,
and no conflicts of interest are declared.
One of the two authors argued that government-funded academic researchers have an
incentive to report adverse findings regarding chemical exposures to preserve their careers
[39]. The reality is quite different—many peer-reviewed publications use the adage “further
research is needed” and are silent about the implications for regulatory action or other oppor-
tunities for action. Researchers may actually—and wrongly—be inclined to temper interpreta-
tion of study findings because definitive conclusions could preclude grant applications with
new studies of chemicals for which an accumulated literature suggests probable causation.
Attacks on scientific norms are likely to continue unabated, be they on climate change, the
benefits of vaccines, synthetic chemical exposures, or many other important public health
issues. We cannot become numb and tune these attacks out. In an era when fake news is ram-
pant, scientists and journal editors must identify knowledge gaps while documenting the
urgency for action. There can of course be debate about the specific action and its urgency.
Taking chlorpyrifos off the market will preserve our children’s intellectual potential. The
chemical and agricultural industries will survive as they have survived the loss of many
chemicals.
