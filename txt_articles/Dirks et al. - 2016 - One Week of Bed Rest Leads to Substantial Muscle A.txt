One Week of Bed Rest Leads to
Substantial Muscle Atrophy and
Induces Whole-Body Insulin
Resistance in the Absence of Skeletal
Muscle Lipid Accumulation
Diabetes 2016;65:2862–2875 | DOI: 10.2337/db15-1661
Short (<10 days) periods of muscle disuse, often neces-
sary for recovery from illness or injury, lead to various
negative health consequences. The current study inves-
tigated mechanisms underlying disuse-induced insulin
resistance, taking into account muscle atrophy. Ten
healthy, young males (age: 23 6 1 years; BMI: 23.0 6
0.9 kg $ m22) were subjected to 1 week of strict bed
rest. Prior to and after bed rest, lean body mass (dual-
energy X-ray absorptiometry) and quadriceps cross-
sectional area (CSA; computed tomography) were
assessed, and peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) and leg
strength were determined. Whole-body insulin sensitiv-
ity was measured using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic
clamp. Additionally, muscle biopsies were collected to
assess muscle lipid (fraction) content and various
markers of mitochondrial and vascular content. Bed rest
resulted in 1.4 6 0.2 kg lean tissue loss and a 3.2 6 0.9%
decline in quadriceps CSA (both P < 0.01). VO2peak and
one-repetition maximum declined by 6.4 6 2.3 (P < 0.05)
and 6.9 6 1.4% (P < 0.01), respectively. Bed rest induced
a 29 6 5% decrease in whole-body insulin sensitivity
(P < 0.01). This was accompanied by a decline in muscle
oxidative capacity, without alterations in skeletal muscle
lipid content or saturation level, markers of oxidative
stress, or capillary density. In conclusion, 1 week of bed
rest substantially reduces skeletal muscle mass and
lowers whole-body insulin sensitivity, without affecting
mechanisms implicated in high-fat diet–induced insulin
resistance.
Recovery from injury or illness generally necessitates a
period of bed rest, often as a consequence of hospitali-
zation. Prolonged (.10 days) periods of bed rest have
been shown to induce substantial changes in body com-
position and are accompanied by overall metabolic decline
(1,2). Though this model of prolonged physical inactivity
has taught us much about muscle disuse atrophy, it may
be of limited clinical relevance to most patients who are,
on average, hospitalized for ,7 days (3). Recent data
from our laboratory as well as others show that merely
a few days of disuse substantially reduces skeletal muscle
mass and strength (2,4–6). As a consequence, it has been
suggested that the accumulation of such short (,10 days),
successive periods of bed rest or immobilization may
largely be responsible for the loss of muscle mass and
metabolic decline observed throughout the life span (7,8).
Impairments in metabolic health following prolonged
disuse have been well described and include a decline in
glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (1,9), a decrease
in resting fat oxidation (10), an increase in mitochondrial
reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (11), and a de-
cline in basal metabolic rate (12). As the decline in meta-
bolic health predisposes to greater morbidity and mortality

METABOLISM
 of patients (13), it is of major clinical relevance to under-
stand the mechanisms responsible for this decline in met-
abolic health. Prolonged disuse has been associated with
substantial loss of muscle mass and/or gain in fat mass
(2). Such changes in body composition lower the body’s
capacity for blood glucose disposal and may contribute to
the decline in metabolic health. However, changes in body
composition can only partly explain the observed metabolic
decline, as reduced insulin sensitivity has been observed dur-
ing bed rest before measurable changes in body composition
became apparent (1,2). We hypothesize that the substantial
muscle atrophy caused by short-term bed rest will contribute
to, but not fully explain, the vast decline in metabolic health.
One of the key hallmarks of metabolic health is insulin
sensitivity. Earlier studies have demonstrated that short
periods of bed rest impair glucose tolerance and lower
whole-body and/or peripheral insulin sensitivity (14–18).
The development of insulin resistance under conditions of
lipid oversupply (e.g., type 2 diabetes mellitus and [high-
fat] overfeeding) has been associated with lipid deposition
in skeletal muscle (19) and, more specifically, with an
increase in intramuscular lipid intermediates such as diac-
ylglycerols (DAGs), ceramides, and long-chain fatty acyl-
CoA, which impair insulin signaling (as reviewed in Ref.
20). Furthermore, both muscle disuse atrophy (21,22) and
the development of insulin resistance (23) have also been
attributed to a decline in mitochondrial content and/or im-
pairments in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function. Addi-
tionally, impairments in micro- and macrovascular function
have been linked to peripheral insulin resistance (24). So far,
it is unclear which mechanism(s) contribute to the proposed
development of insulin resistance during short-term bed rest.
The objective of the current study was to assess mech-
anisms that may contribute to the development of insulin
resistance during short-term muscle disuse, taking into
account the expected muscle atrophy. To achieve this, we
subjected healthy, young males to 1 week of strict bed rest
and used comprehensive measures of muscle mass and
muscle function in combination with detailed metabolic
phenotyping (e.g., whole-body insulin sensitivity, sub-
strate metabolism, skeletal muscle lipid content and
composition, muscle oxidative capacity, and capillary
density) to determine their possible contribution to the
development of disuse-induced whole-body insulin re-
sistance. Importantly, this was conducted under energy-
balanced conditions to eliminate the contribution of
overfeeding to our results. We hypothesized that bed
rest–induced insulin resistance is attributed to mecha-
nisms known to induce insulin resistance in chronic met-
abolic disease (i.e., ectopic lipid deposition, intramuscular
accumulation of lipid intermediates, a decline in mito-
chondrial content and/or impairment in skeletal muscle
capillarization). In this study, we demonstrate that short-
term bed rest leads to skeletal muscle atrophy, pro-
nounced whole-body insulin resistance, and a decline in
skeletal muscle oxidative capacity. Strikingly, these effects
do not seem to be mediated via mechanisms involved in
obesity-related insulin resistance such as skeletal muscle
lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, and micro- and/or
macrovascular dysfunction.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Subjects
Ten healthy young men (age 23 6 1 years) were included in
the current study. Subjects’ characteristics are presented in
Table 1. Prior to inclusion in the study, subjects filled out a
general health questionnaire and completed a routine medical
screening to ensure their eligibility to take part in the study.
Exclusion criteria were a BMI ,18.5 or .30 kg $ m22, a
(family) history of thrombosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus (de-
termined by HbA1c values .7.0% [53 mmol$mol21]), and
any back, knee, or shoulder complaints. Furthermore, sub-
jects who had been involved in structured and prolonged
resistance-type exercise training during the 6 months prior
to the study were also excluded. All subjects were informed
on the nature and risks of the experiment before written
informed consent was obtained. During the screening visit,
a fasting blood sample was taken to assess HbA1c, resting
energy expenditure was measured with the use of a venti-
lated hood, and a one-repetition maximum (1RM) estimation
test was performed. The current study was approved by
the Medical Ethical Committee of Maastricht University
Medical Centre (registration number 14-3-013) in accor-
dance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Experimental Outline
The experimental protocol is depicted in Supplementary
Fig. 1. After inclusion into the study, subjects visited the
university for a pretesting visit during which the 1RM and
peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) tests were performed. Fol-
lowing this visit, a 7-day period of standardized nutrition
was started. On day 6 of the controlled diet, a mixed-meal
tolerance test was performed. The day after, on day 7 of
the standardized diet and the day prior to bed rest, test
day 1 was scheduled. During this day, a muscle biopsy was
taken from the m. vastus lateralis, and a hyperinsulinemic-
euglycemic clamp and computed tomography (CT) and dual-
energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans were performed.
The next morning, subjects arrived at the laboratory to
start the bed rest period. The meal tolerance test was re-
peated on day 6 of bed rest. After exactly 7 days of bed
rest, test day 1 was repeated, and subjects were allowed to

 go home. On the next day, subjects returned to the labo-
ratory to repeat the 1RM and VO2peak tests.
One Week of Bed Rest
To mimic the effects of a standard hospitalization pro-
cedure, subjects underwent a 7-day period of strict bed rest.
On the morning of day 1, subjects reported to the laboratory
in the fasted state at 0800. From that moment on, subjects
remained in bed. During the day, subjects were permitted to
use a pillow and elevation of the bed-back to perform their
daily activities. All hygiene and sanitary activities were per-
formed on the bed. Every morning, subjects were woken at
08 00, and lights were turned off at 2300. Participants were
monitored continuously by the research team.
Dietary Intake
During the screening visit, resting energy expenditure was
measured by indirect calorimetry using an open-circuit
ventilated hood system (Omnical; Maastricht University,
Maastricht, the Netherlands) (25). For 7 days prior to bed
rest, subjects were given standardized food to prepare and
consume at home. During the bed rest period itself, die-
tary intake was entirely controlled. During the pre–bed
rest period, subjects received all food products and pre-
pared the meals at home. In that week, subjects reported
to the laboratory once or twice to allow adjustments of
the diet in response to body weight changes (when nec-
essary) to keep body weight stable. During bed rest, en-
ergy intake was increased when subjects reported being
hungry. Energy requirements were estimated based on
indirect calorimetry data, multiplied by an activity factor
of 1.55 (prior to bed rest) and 1.35 (during bed rest).
Macronutrient composition of the diet was identical before
and during the bed rest period (Supplementary Table 1).
Body Composition
During test days 1 and 2 (prior to and immediately after
bed rest, respectively), anatomical cross-sectional area (CSA)
of the quadriceps muscle, hamstrings, and whole thigh were
assessed via a single slice CT scan (Philips Brilliance 64; Philips
Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands). While subjects were
lying supine, with their legs extended and their feet secured, a
3-mm thick axial image was taken 15 cm proximal to the top
of the patella. On test day 1, the precise scanning position
was marked with semipermanent ink for replication on test
day 2. Next, a single slice CT scan at the level of the upper
border of the L3 vertebra was taken to assess total muscle
CSA (i.e., all paraspinal and abdominal muscle). For this scan,
subjects were lying in a prone position, with their chin resting
on both hands. The following scanning characteristics were
used: 120 kV, 300 mA, rotation time of 0.75 s, and a field of
view of 500 3 500 mm. CT scans were analyzed for the CSA
of the whole thigh muscle as well as the quadriceps and
hamstring muscles and for total muscle CSA at the level of
the L3 vertebra by manual tracing using ImageJ software
(version 1.48t; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD)
(26). The L3 Skeletal Muscle Index was calculated by dividing
the paraspinal muscle area by height squared. Tissue with
Hounsfield units between 229 and +150 HU was selected as
muscle tissue. The L3 CT scans were also used to determine
intramuscular adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue, and
subcutaneous adipose tissue using SliceOmatic software
(version 5.0; Tomovision, Montreal, QC, Canada) as described
previously (27). Body composition was measured via DXA
(Hologic, Discovery A; QDR Series, Bradford, MA). The sys-
tem’s software package Apex version 2.3 was used to deter-
mine whole-body and regional lean mass, fat mass, and bone
mineral content.
Insulin Sensitivity
On the day prior to bed rest and directly after 1 week of
bed rest, a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp was per-
formed to assess whole-body insulin sensitivity. At the
applied level of hyperinsulinemia, hepatic glucose output
will be minimal (28,29). Therefore, the presented whole-
body insulin sensitivity data presented in this study mainly
reflect peripheral insulin sensitivity. Due to the choices for
the setup of this experiment, this protocol does not allow
assessment of the impact of bed rest on maximal insulin
responsiveness. Before the start of the experiment, a Tef-
lon cannula was inserted anterogradely in an antecubital
vein of the forearm for the infusion of 20% glucose (Baxter
B.V., Utrecht, the Netherlands) and insulin (40 mU $ m22 $
min21; Novorapid, Novo Nordisk Farma, Alphen aan den
Rijn, the Netherlands). On the contralateral hand, a second
cannula was inserted into a superficial dorsal hand vein.
From this catheter, arterialized venous blood was obtained
by heating the hand in a hot-box (60°C). A small amount of
blood was drawn every 5 min throughout the entire 2.5 h
clamp to determine glucose concentration (ABL800 Flex;
Radiometer Medical, Brønshøj, Denmark). The amount of
glucose infused was altered to maintain euglycemia at
5.0 mmol $ L21. The last 30 min of the clamp were used
to calculate the mean glucose infusion rate (GIR).
At baseline and during the last 30 min of the clamp,
fasting and insulin-stimulated energy expenditure and
substrate oxidation were assessed by indirect calorimetry
using an open-circuit ventilated hood system (Omnical;
Maastricht University, Maastricht, the Netherlands) (25).
From these data, total fat and carbohydrate oxidation
rates and metabolic flexibility were calculated as described
before (30). To test glucose tolerance in a practical man-
ner, a meal tolerance test was performed 2 days prior to
bed rest and on day 6 of bed rest at 08:30 as part of the
standardized diet. Before and after bed rest, subjects re-
ceived identical test meals which provided 7.6 6 0.2 kcal $ kg
body weight21, 72 6 1 g carbohydrate (52 6 0.4 energy
percentage [En%]), 19 6 0.3 g fat (31 6 0.4 En%), and 24 6
0.1 g protein (17 6 0.2 En%). While subjects were in an
overnight fasted state, an antecubital vein was cannulated to
allow repeated blood sampling. Prior to breakfast, and at t =
30, 60, 90, and 120 min following meal ingestion, a blood
sample was collected in a supine position to assess plasma
glucose and insulin concentrations. The disposition index
(DI), as a measure of b-cell function, was calculated using
the following formula: DI = (I120 2 I0/G120 2 G0) 3 OGIS.

Impact of Short-term Bed Rest
Diabetes Volume 65, October 2016
 Muscle Function Tests
Eight or 9 days before, and on the day after the 7-day bed
rest, an incremental cycle ergometer test was performed
with 40-W increments every 3 min to determine peak
oxygen uptake (VO2peak). Next, 1RM strength tests on a
leg press and leg extension device (Technogym, Rotterdam,
the Netherlands) were performed to determine maximal
leg strength. The estimations obtained during the screen-
ing visit, obtained via the multiple repetitions testing pro-
cedure (31), were used to determine 1RM as described
previously (32). In short, after warming up, the load was
set at 90–95% of the estimated maximum strength and
increased after each successful lift until failure. A 2-min
resting period was allowed between subsequent attempts.
A repetition was deemed valid if the participant was able
to complete the entire lift in a controlled manner without
assistance. Finally, maximal grip strength was determined
using a JAMAR handheld dynamometer (model BK-7498;
Fred Sammons, Inc., Burr Ridge, IL). Three consecutive
measures were recorded for both hands, and maximal
grip strength of both hands was averaged to calculate mean
maximal grip strength (33).
Blood and Muscle Sampling
During the meal tolerance tests and on each day of bed
rest, blood samples were collected in EDTA-containing
tubes and directly centrifuged at 1,000 3 g for 10 min at
4°C. Aliquots of plasma were snap-frozen in liquid nitro-
gen and stored at 280°C until further analysis. Addition-
ally, before and after bed rest, a single muscle biopsy was
collected from the vastus lateralis muscle. After local an-
esthesia was induced, a percutaneous needle biopsy was
taken ;15 cm above the patella (34). Any visible non-
muscle tissue was directly removed, and part of the bi-
opsy sample was embedded in Tissue-Tek (4583; Sakura
Finetek, Zoeterwoude, the Netherlands) before being frozen
in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane. All remaining muscle
tissue was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Muscle
samples were subsequently stored at 280°C until further
analyses.
Plasma Biochemistry
Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were ana-
lyzed using commercially available kits (GLUC3, refer-
ence 05168791 190, Roche; and Immunologic, reference
12017547 122, Roche) (interassay coefficient of variation
4.9% and intra-assay coefficient of variation 1.5%, re-
spectively). Plasma-free fatty acid concentrations were
analyzed with an ABX Pentra 400 analyzer (Horiba Di-
agnostics, Montpellier, France) with test kits purchased
from ABX Diagnostics (Montpellier, France).
Skeletal Muscle Analyses
Fiber Typing
Muscle biopsies were stained for muscle fiber typing as
described previously (35). The section of the muscle that
was mounted and frozen in Tissue-Tek was cut into 5-mm
thick cryosections using a cryostat at 220°C. Pre– and
post–bed rest samples of each subject were mounted
together on uncoated, precleaned glass slides, thereby
carefully aligning the samples for cross-sectional fiber
analyses. Stainings were performed to analyze muscle fiber-
type specific CSA and intramyocellular triglyceride con-
tent. To measure fiber type–specific CSA, slides were
incubated with primary antibodies directed against myo-
sin heavy chain (MHC)-I (A4.840, dilution 1:25; DSHB)
and laminin (polyclonal rabbit antilaminin, L9393, dilu-
tion 1:50; Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, the Netherlands).
After washing, the appropriate secondary antibodies were
applied: goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 647 and goat
anti-mouse IgM Alexa Fluor 555 (A-21245 and A-21422;
dilution 1:400 and 1:500, respectively; Molecular Probes,
Invitrogen, Breda, the Netherlands). Myonuclei were
stained with DAPI (D1306; 0.238 mmol/L; Molecular
Probes). Both primary and secondary antibodies were di-
luted in 0.1% BSA (A7906; Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.1% Tween
20 (P2287; Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in PBS. Incubation of
antibodies was performed at room temperature. Skeletal
muscle tissue was stained as follows. Tissue was fixated in
acetone for 5 min, after which the slides were air dried for
15 min and incubated with 3% BSA in 0.1% Tween-PBS
for 30 min. Slides were then washed (standard washing
protocol: 5 min 0.1% Tween-PBS, 2 3 5 min PBS) and
incubated with the first antibodies for 45 min. After wash-
ing, slides were incubated with the secondary antibodies,
diluted together with DAPI, for 45 min. After a last wash-
ing step, cover glasses were mounted by Mowiol (475904-
100GM; Calbiochem, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). As a
result of the staining procedure, nuclei were stained in
blue, MHC-I in red, and laminin in far-red. Images were
visualized and automatically captured at 310 original mag-
nification with a Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope
with customized spinning disk unit (DSU; Olympus, Zoe-
terwoude, the Netherlands) with a ultra-high sensitivity
monochrome electron multiplier CCD camera (1,000 3
1,000 pixels, C9100-02; Hamamatsu Photonics, Hama-
matsu City, Japan). Image acquisition was done by Micro-
manager 1.4 software (36), and images were analyzed with
ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). The images were
recorded and analyzed by an investigator blinded to subject
coding. As a measure of fiber circularity, form factors were
calculated by using the following formula: (4pi $ CSA) $
(perimeter)22. On average, 176 6 31 and 212 6 60 muscle
fibers were analyzed in the pre– and post–bed rest samples,
respectively.
Capillary Density
An immunohistochemical staining for skeletal muscle
capillarization (Fig. 6D) was performed as described pre-
viously (37). Slides with muscle cryosections of 5 mm were
taken from the 280°C freezer and thawed for 30 min at
room temperature. After fixation for 5 min with acetone,
samples were air dried again for 15 min. Slides were then
incubated for 45 min with CD31 (dilution 1:50; M0823;
DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark). Slides were then

 washed (standard washing protocol 3 3 5 min PBS). After
that, a 45-min incubation step with goat anti-mouse bi-
otin (BA-2000, dilution 1:200; Vector Laboratories, Bur-
lingame, CA) was started, and a standard wash was
performed. Next, slides were incubated with Avidin Texas
Red (A2006, dilution 1:400; Vector Laboratories) and an-
tibodies against MHC-I (A4.840, dilution 1:25; DSHB) and
laminin (polyclonal rabbit antilaminin, dilution 1:50,
L9393; Sigma-Aldrich) for 45 min and washed. In the fi-
nal incubation step, goat anti-mouse IgM Alexa Fluor
488 and goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 350 (A-21042
and A-11046, dilution 1:200 and 1:133, respectively; Mo-
lecular Probes) were applied for 30 min. After washing,
slides were mounted with Mowiol. The staining procedure
resulted in images with laminin in blue, MHC-I in green,
and CD31 in red. Images were automatically captured
at 310 original magnification with a Olympus BX51 fluo-
rescence microscope with customized spinning disk unit
(DSU; Olympus) with a ultra-high sensitivity mono-
chrome electron multiplier CCD camera (1,000 3 1,000 pix-
els, C9100-02; Hamamatsu Photonics). Image acquisition
was done by Micromanager 1.4 software (36), and images
were analyzed with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health).
The images were recorded and analyzed by an investigator
blinded to subject coding. In all images, a minimum of
30 fibers were counted per fiber type. The number of capil-
laries was counted and expressed as capillary-to-fiber ratio
and capillary-to-fiber perimeter exchange index (CFPE; num-
ber of capillaries per 1,000-mm perimeter).
Fiber Type–Specific Lipid Content, Lipid Fractions,
and Saturation
An Oil Red O (ORO) staining was performed to analyze
muscle fiber type–specific intramyocellular triglyceride con-
tent, based on previous work (38). Freshly cut samples
were air dried for 30 min and fixated in 3.7% formaldehyde
(1040051000; Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) for
60 min. After rinsing 3 3 30 s with Milli-Q, slides were
incubated for 5 min in 0.5% Triton X-100 (108643; Merck
Millipore) in PBS. Slides were then washed for 3 3 5 min
with PBS and incubated for 45 min with primary anti-
bodies against MHC-I (A4.951, dilution 1:25; DSHB) and
laminin (polyclonal rabbit antilaminin, dilution 1:50;
L9393; Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.05% Tween-PBS. After washing
(1 3 5 min 0.05% Tween-PBS, 2 3 5 min PBS), slides were
incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies: goat
anti-mouse IgG1 Alexa Fluor 488 and goat anti-rabbit IgG
Alexa Fluor 350 (A-21121 and A-11046; dilution 1:133 and
1:200, respectively; Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). Slides
were then washed (1 3 5 min 0.05% Tween-PBS, 2 3 5
min PBS) and rinsed for 30 s with Milli-Q, after which
slides were placed in the ORO solution for 30 min. This
solution was made by dissolving 250 mg ORO powder
(O0625-25G; Sigma-Aldrich) in 50 mL 60% triethyl-
phosphate (538728; Sigma-Aldrich). Of this solution,
48 mL was added to 32 mL of Milli-Q, which was then filtered
using a paper-folding filter. After incubation with the ORO
solution, slides were rinsed with Milli-Q for 3 3 30 s and
placed under slow-running cold tap water before being
mounted with cover glasses and Mowiol. The staining pro-
cedure resulted in images with laminin in blue, MHC-I in
green, and ORO in red. Images were semiautomatically
captured at 340 original magnification with using a Nikon
E800 fluorescent microscope coupled with a Nikon DS-Fi1c
camera (Nikon Instruments, Amsterdam, the Netherlands)
using the NIS-Elements BR software package version
4.20.01. Analysis of the images was done using ImageJ
software (National Institutes of Health) by an investigator
blinded to subject coding. No differences in fiber circularity
were observed between pre– and post–bed rest samples.
On average, 34 6 1 muscle fibers were analyzed in both
the pre– and post–bed rest samples. A representative
image of the ORO staining is displayed in Fig. 3A.
To determine intramuscular lipid content and the
degree of saturation, ;50 mg wet muscle was used as
described elsewhere (39). Total lipid was extracted using
chloroform-methanol (1:1 volume for volume) and inter-
nal standards and thereafter evaporated under nitrogen
at 37°C. The extracted lipids were separated into triacyl-
glycerol, DAG, free fatty acids (FFA), and phospholipid
(PL) by thin-layer chromatography and transferred into
separate tubes. After incubation with methanol, pentane
was added to the samples, which were then vortexed and
centrifuged. The pentane extracts (upper phase) were iso-
lated, and the residues were evaporated under nitrogen at
37°C. Finally, the residues were dissolved in iso-octane,
and FA concentrations in the fractions were determined
using an analytical gas chromatograph (GC-2010 Plus;
Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Muscle ceramide content and
ceramide fatty acid species were analyzed as described
previously (40).
Enzyme Activities
For mitochondrial enzyme activities, ;10 mg of the muscle
was immediately homogenized in 100 volume for weight
of a 100 mmol/L potassium phosphate buffer and used for
the measurements of maximal b-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehy-
drogenase (b-HAD) and citrate synthase (CS) activi-
ties. Total muscle b-HAD activity was measured in
TrisHCl buffer (50 mmol/L TrisHCl, 2 mmol/L EDTA,
and 250 mmol/L NADH [pH 7]) and 0.04% Triton-X. The
reaction was started by adding 100 mmol/L acetoacetyl-CoA,
and absorbance was measured at 340 nm over a 2-min
period (37°C) (41). The CS activity was assayed spectropho-
tometrically at 37°C by measuring the disappearance of
NADH at 412 nm (42).
Western Blotting
Muscle was homogenized as previously described (43),
10 mL of protein was loaded, and standard SDS-PAGE
procedures were followed. Antibodies included total and
phosphorylated Akt (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
MA), oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (MitoSciences,
Eugene, OR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),

2 (SOD2; all Abcam, Cambridge, U.K.), 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal
(4-HNE; Alpha Diagnostics, San Antonio, TX), COXIV
(Invitrogen), and a-tubulin (Abcam) as a loading control.
Protein carbonylation (Oxyblot; Millipore) was determined
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Ponceau
staining was used to confirm equal loading for antibodies
that required the entire membrane (e.g., 4-HNE and pro-
tein carbonylation). All samples for a given protein were
detected on the same membrane using chemilumines-
cence and the FluorChem HD imaging system (Alpha
Innotech, Santa Clara, CA).
Statistics
All data are expressed as mean 6 SEM. Changes over time
were analyzed using a paired samples Student t test (before
vs. after bed rest) or a one-way ANOVA (for daily measure-
ments) using a Bonferroni post hoc test. Muscle character-
istics were analyzed using a repeated-measures ANOVA
with time (before vs. after bed rest) and fiber type (type I
vs. type II) as within-subjects factors. In case of a signif-
icant main effect, paired samples t tests were performed to
assess time effects within fiber types. For the ORO analy-
ses, region (subsarcolemmal vs. intramuscular fat) was added
as a within-subjects factor. Statistical significance was set at
P , 0.05. All data were analyzed using SPSS version 22.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
RESULTS
Body Composition
Figure 1 displays the effect of short-term bed rest on skeletal
muscle mass as assessed by DXA (Fig. 1A) and CT (Fig. 1B).
After 1 week of bed rest, participants lost 1.4 6 0.2 kg
(range: 0.6 to 2.8 kg) lean tissue mass (Fig. 1A) (P , 0.01),
representing a 2.5 6 0.4% loss of lean tissue mass. Lean
tissue was mainly lost from the trunk (1.0 6 0.2 kg) and
legs (0.28 6 0.12 kg) (Table 2). Fat mass did not change
during 1 week of bed rest as participants were fed in energy
balance (20.2 6 0.1 kg; P . 0.05). A 3.2 6 0.9% decline in
CSA of m. quadriceps femoris was observed following bed
rest (from 7,900 6 315 to 7,664 6 354 mm2; P , 0.01)
(Fig. 1B). CSA of the whole thigh muscle had declined by
2.2 6 1.0% (P , 0.05). CT scans at the level of the L3
vertebra showed a 1.3 6 0.4% decline in total muscle CSA
(P , 0.01). As a consequence, the L3 Skeletal Muscle Index
had declined from 51.9 6 2.5 to 51.1 6 2.4 cm2 (P , 0.01).
Analyses performed with SliceOmatic revealed no changes in
intermuscular adipose tissue (P . 0.05) and visceral adipose
tissue (P . 0.05). Subcutaneous adipose tissue declined
from 93 6 28 to 89 6 27 mm2 (P , 0.01). Following bed
rest, nonsignificant declines in type I (from 6,650 6 725 to
6,218 6 662 mm2) and type II muscle fiber CSA (from
6,542 6 746 to 5,982 6 525 mm2) were observed (P .
0.05) (Supplementary Table 2). No differences in fiber circu-
larity were observed between pre– and post–bed rest samples.
Insulin Sensitivity and Glycemic Control
GIR during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp had
declined by 29 6 5% (range 9–53%; P , 0.01) following
1 week of bed rest (Fig. 2A). Adjustment of GIR for total
body weight rather than lean body mass yielded similar
results (229 6 5%; P , 0.01). Postprandial plasma glu-
cose and insulin concentrations observed during the meal
tolerance tests are displayed in Fig. 2C and D. For plasma
glucose, the area under the curve (AUC) and incremental
area under the curve (iAUC) did not differ between both
tests (both P . 0.05). In contrast, plasma insulin concen-
trations showed a significant increase in AUC (from 4,963 6
779 to 6,944 6 513 mU $ L21 $ min21; P , 0.05) and iAUC
(from 4,213 6 773 to 5,736 6 430 mU $ L21 $ min21; P ,
0.05) following bed rest. Fasting plasma glucose concentra-
tions (Fig. 2B) averaged 5.7 6 0.2 mmol $ L21 prior to bed
rest and did not change during the bed rest period (P .
0.05). For plasma insulin concentrations (Fig. 2B), a significant
time effect (P , 0.001) was observed such that fasting in-
sulin concentrations had increased from 7.2 6 1.8 mU $ L21
at baseline to 11.8 6 1.8 mU$L21 after 1 week of bed
rest. Consequently, the homeostasis model assessment of
insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index increased from 1.9 6
0.5 to 3.1 6 0.5 from day 1 to 8 (P , 0.01). The calculated
DI was 27,043 6 11,949 and 16,945 6 9,972 pre– and
post–bed rest, respectively (P . 0.05).

 Energy Expenditure and Whole-Body Substrate
Oxidation
Resting metabolic rate, as measured by indirect calorim-
etry, tended to decline from 1,694 6 47 to 1,624 6
34 kcal $ d21 (23.8 6 2.0%; P = 0.070) following bed
rest. When corrected for the total lean tissue mass, no
such trend was observed (P . 0.05). During both the
pre– and post–bed rest clamps, energy expenditure was
increased during insulin infusion (time effect; P , 0.01).
Stimulation by insulin increased the respiratory quotient
from 0.84 6 0.01 during the baseline period to 0.93 6
0.01 during exogenous insulin infusion (P , 0.001), with-
out differences between pre– and post–bed rest values.
Additionally, carbohydrate oxidation rates were increased
during the pre– and post–bed rest clamp (baseline: 0.13 6
0.01, hyperinsulinemia 0.24 6 0.01 g $ min21; P , 0.001).
Fat oxidation rates decreased from 0.056 6 0.007 (baseline)
to 0.011 6 0.005 g $ min21 (insulin) during the pre–bed rest
clamp and from 0.047 6 0.004 to 0.014 6 0.004 g $ min21
during the post–bed rest clamp (effect of insulin, P , 0.001;
trend for time 3 treatment effect; P = 0.065). Total protein
content and phosphorylation status of both Akt (Ser473) and
Akt (Thr308), measured in fasted biopsies, were not altered
following bed rest (P . 0.05).
Functional Outcomes
A significant decline in 1RM leg press strength, from 211 6
16 to 196 6 45 kg (27 6 1%; P , 0.01), was observed
following bed rest. Similarly, leg extension strength de-
creased from 128 6 7 to 117 6 7 kg (28 6 2%; P , 0.05).
Following bed rest, no changes in handgrip strength were
observed: grip strength averaged 45 6 2 kg prior to bed
rest and 46 6 2 kg after the 7-day intervention (P .
0.05). Results from the cycle ergometer test showed a
decline in VO2peak from 3,332 6 200 to 3100 6
162 mL $ min21, representing a 6.4 6 2.3% loss in
VO2peak following bed rest (P , 0.05) at a maximal work-
load of 260 6 16 vs 246 6 15 W, respectively (P , 0.05).
Lipid Metabolism
Plasma FFA concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 2) showed
a time effect (P , 0.001) during bed rest. Post hoc analyses
revealed that values on day 7 of bed rest were greater than
on days 2 through 5 (P , 0.05). At baseline, results from
the ORO staining showed a greater lipid area percentage in
type I than type II muscle fibers (P , 0.05, Fig. 3B), with
smaller droplets in type I versus type II fibers in the sub-
sarcolemmal region (P , 0.05). Following bed rest, no
changes in lipid area percentage were observed (P .
0.05). Droplet size (Fig. 3C) changed, such that a significant
time 3 fiber type interaction was found (P , 0.01). Based
on this interaction, we showed greater lipid droplets in
type I versus type II fibers following bed rest (P , 0.01).
Skeletal muscle lipid content of the measured lipid pools
did not change with bed rest (all P . 0.05, Fig. 4). In the PL
pool, the percentage saturation increased (P , 0.05) (Sup-
plementary Table 3). For the three other pools, the pro-
portion of polyunsaturated fatty acids increased or tended
to increase. Although contents of some specific fatty acid
species was altered following bedrest, no changes in total
contents of any of the measured lipid pools were observed
(Supplementary Table 4).

Impact of Short-term Bed Rest
Diabetes Volume 65, October 2016
 Oxidative Capacity
Fig. 5 depicts results on various parameters of mitochondrial
content. CS activity (Fig. 5A) decreased by 8 6 3% following
bed rest (P , 0.05). Activity of b-HAD (Fig. 5B) tended to
decrease by 9 6 6% (P = 0.071). Protein content of the
different complexes of the OXPHOS system all decreased or
tended to decrease, as depicted in Fig. 5C. Lipid peroxidation,
determined by 4-HNE content, did not change following bed
rest (Fig. 5D) (P . 0.05). For protein carbonylation (Fig. 5E)
content, a trend for a decline was observed (P = 0.075). Both
SOD2 (Fig. 5F) and catalase (Fig. 5G) protein expression did
not change following 1 week of bed rest (P . 0.05).
Vascularization
Seven days of bed rest did not lead to significant changes
in VEGF (213 6 10%; P . 0.05) and eNOS (212 6 13%;
P = 0.086) protein expression (Fig. 6A and C). For HIF-1a
protein expression (Fig. 6B), a 35 6 11% increase was
observed following bed rest (P , 0.05). Bed rest did not
lead to changes in capillary density or oxidative exchange
across the muscle bed, as shown by the capillary-to-fiber
ratio (Fig. 6E) and CFPE index (Fig. 6F).
DISCUSSION
In the current study, we observed that merely 1 week of
bed rest strongly reduced muscle mass, strength, and
physical performance. Bed rest resulted in the onset of
severe whole-body insulin resistance and a strong decline
in skeletal muscle oxidative capacity, both of which
occurred in the absence of lipid accumulation or a decline
in capillary density in skeletal muscle tissue.
The impact of prolonged bed rest upon skeletal muscle
mass and metabolic health has been studied extensively
(1,2). Though the model of prolonged disuse is of sub-
stantial scientific importance, it may be of more clinical
relevance to study short periods of disuse, as patients are
typically hospitalized for up to 7 days (3). Recently, we
showed that even 5 days of disuse can lead to a ;4%
decline in muscle mass and a concomitant ;9% decline
in muscle strength (5). In keeping with this, in the current
study, we report a 3.2% decline in quadriceps CSA follow-
ing 1 week of bed rest (Fig. 1B) (2). On a whole-body level,
this translated to a 1.4 6 0.2 kg loss of lean tissue (Fig.
1A), which is equivalent to ;200 g lean tissue loss
per day. In comparison, it took a group of healthy,
young males 12 weeks of progressive resistance-type ex-
ercise training to gain the equivalent amount of lean tis-
sue (1.7 kg) (44). Thus, we can lose as much muscle in
1 week of bed rest as we can gain by 12 weeks of intense
resistance-type exercise training. Furthermore, the loss
of muscle was accompanied by a substantial ;8% decline

 in muscle strength and a ;6% reduction in VO2peak. These
findings clearly demonstrate that even a short period of
disuse has severe consequences for muscle mass and phys-
ical performance, an effect that is unlikely compensated
for during rehabilitation. As a consequence, it has been
suggested that successive periods of bed rest or immo-
bilization may be responsible for the progressive decline
in muscle mass throughout our lifespan (7,8).
The loss of skeletal muscle mass and/or strength during
hospitalization has been shown to be predictive of morbi-
dity and mortality (13). This may be more related to the im-
pact of disuse on metabolic health than to the decline
in muscle mass per se. Therefore, in the current study, we
also aimed to assess the impact of short-term disuse on
metabolic health. We performed hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic
clamps prior to and after 1 week of bed rest to assess
whole-body insulin sensitivity and observed a substantial
;30% decline in glucose disposal (Fig. 2A). Under these
conditions, hepatic glucose output is strongly dimin-
ished, and skeletal muscle is responsible for ;85% of
glucose disposal (29). This implies that merely 1 week
of bed rest can lower insulin sensitivity by as much as
30%. These findings are in line with previous studies,
demonstrating similar declines in whole-body and/or
peripheral insulin sensitivity following 7–9 days of bed
rest (14–16,18). This decline in whole-body insulin sen-
sitivity manifested in a greater postprandial insulin re-
sponse required to maintain normoglycemia following bed

 rest (Fig. 2C and D), illustrating the impact of physical
inactivity on day-to-day metabolic control. Supporting the
concept that profound insulin resistance manifested with
bed rest, relatively insensitive population markers such
as the HOMA-IR index also increased during the inter-
vention. Interestingly, the increase in HOMA-IR over time
did not occur until 4 days of bed rest and was entirely
attributed to an increase in postabsorptive insulin con-
centrations (Fig. 2B). Thus, it could be suggested that
disuse-induced insulin resistance occurs even more rap-
idly than 1 week (9). Previous work aiming to elucidate
the impact of bed rest on insulin signaling has shown that
bed rest induced insulin resistance is accompanied by re-
ductions in the contents and/or activity of key proteins
regulating glucose uptake and storage in muscle, such as
GLUT4, hexokinase 2, and glycogen synthase (18). How-
ever, the decline in insulin sensitivity following bed rest
could not be explained by impaired insulin and AMPK
signaling, as Akt and AS160 signaling seemed to remain
intact following short-term bed rest (45). Consequently,
other mechanisms are likely to be responsible for the
development of insulin resistance following short-term
bed rest.
Despite substantial muscle atrophy, a ;3% decline in
lean mass likely cannot explain the observed ;30% de-
cline in whole-body insulin sensitivity. As such, during
short-term disuse, other mechanisms must contribute to
the development of whole-body insulin resistance. Ectopic
lipid deposition has often been suggested to lead to the
development of insulin resistance in situations of lipid
oversupply (19). Although previous studies have reported
increases in intramuscular lipid deposition following pro-
longed bed rest (1), the impact of short-term disuse on
skeletal muscle lipid accumulation has been comparatively
underinvestigated (46). In line with our previous findings
(46), in the current study, we did not detect a measurable

changes in VEGF (A, predicted molecular weight 43 kDa) protein expression were observed. A significant increase in HIF-1a (B, 97 kDa)
protein expression was observed following bed rest. Total eNOS (C, 133 kDa) protein expression tended to decline following 1 week of bed
rest (P = 0.086). D represents an immunohistochemical image of the CD31 staining, made by microscopy with a magnification of 203. I:

 increase in type I or II muscle fiber lipid content (Fig. 3B).
We extend on these findings by reporting no increase in
subsarcolemmal lipid depots, which have been suggested
to more specifically contribute to the development of insulin
resistance (47). Of course, it could be speculated that an
intracellular increase in specific fatty acid intermediates,
such as DAGs, fatty acyl-CoA, ceramides, and/or free fatty
acids may be responsible for impairments in insulin recep-
tor function and glucose trafficking (20). Therefore, we also
measured muscle lipid content of various lipid fractions
(Fig. 4). In line with our fiber type–specific data, we did
not observe changes in lipid content of the various lipid
fractions, including DAGs, following 1 week bed rest.
Whereas we did see changes in some specific DAG species
(Supplementary Table 4), these were not the 18:2 species
that have been specifically linked to insulin resistance (48).
Whereas previous work has been inconclusive about the
role for ceramides in the development of insulin resis-
tance (49–51), we demonstrate no change in total con-
tent and only minor changes in specific fatty acid species
within the ceramide pool following bed rest, thereby
likely ruling out a mediating role for ceramides in the
development of insulin resistance during bed rest. Fur-
thermore, the degree of saturation of specifically the
DAG pool has been reported to be increased in insulin-
resistant men when compared with control subjects (52).
However, we failed to observe any changes in the degree
of saturation of the various lipid pools, but actually ob-
served a relative increase in polyunsaturated fatty acids
(Supplementary Table 3) in the different lipid pools. This
can potentially be explained by a preferential oxidation of
saturated fatty acids during disuse, which has been sug-
gested previously (10). Collectively, changes in lipid content
and/or lipid composition in skeletal muscle tissue following
bed rest are unlikely to explain the observed development
of insulin resistance, and therefore other processes must
be implicated.
Mitochondrial dysfunction, and specifically the release
of mitochondrial ROS, has been postulated as a key factor
in the development of muscle disuse atrophy (23) and
insulin resistance (53,54). Indeed, previous disuse studies
have demonstrated a decrease in mitochondrial protein
content and enzyme activities, the onset of mitochondrial
respiratory dysfunction, and an increase in ROS emission
in situations of muscle atrophy (11,22,55,56). In keeping
with this, we show a tendency for a decline in b-HAD (Fig.
4B) and a significant 8% decline in citrate synthase activity
(Fig. 4A), indicative of a decline in mitochondrial content
(57). Similarly, protein content of all complexes of OXPHOS
(Fig. 4C) decreased with bed rest. Given the lack of a fiber-
type shift away from oxidative fibers (Supplementary Table
2) that is normally observed following prolonged bed rest,
these changes cannot be explained by differences in fiber-
type distribution. Additionally, it has been suggested that
short-term bed rest could lead to oxidative stress, which in
turn triggers the imbalance between muscle protein synthe-
sis and breakdown (58). However, we did not find increases
in either 4-HNE or protein carbonylation, suggesting the
absence of overt oxidative damage. These findings are in
contrast to a previous report analyzing markers of oxidative
damage following a longer period of bed rest (59), suggest-
ing that oxidative damage is a consequence of longer pe-
riods of bed rest. Given these data, it was not surprising
that no changes in the antioxidants superoxide dismutase
2 (SOD2) and catalase (Fig. 4F and G) were found, as they
would usually be increased in the presence of oxidative
stress. Previous work by Abadi et al. (22) indicates that
muscle oxidative capacity is impaired following short-term
disuse. We extend these findings by confirming actual declines
in muscle oxidative capacity following bed rest and suggest
that, despite not having measured the glutathione/oxidized
glutathione ratio to assess short-term redox status, overt
oxidative stress does not seem to play a role in the rapid
development of insulin resistance during up to 1 week of
bed rest. Although time-course studies are clearly warranted
to look at instigating factors of muscle atrophy and the
rapid development of insulin resistance, our data suggest
that impairments in oxidative capacity may (partly) contrib-
ute to the observed decline in insulin sensitivity during
short-term bed rest.
As in vivo peripheral insulin sensitivity can also be
modulated by changes in macro- and microvascular func-
tion (60), we also evaluated the effect of bed rest on various
angiogenic markers by measuring the expression of VEGF
and eNOS, as well as HIF-1a. These data suggest potential
early adaptive responses following 1 week of bed rest, as
the expression of eNOS tended to decrease, whereas an
increase in HIF-1a was seen (Fig. 5). However, this did
not result in actual changes in skeletal muscle capillary
density as measured by immunohistochemistry. This is
in line with previous work showing no changes in capil-
lary density following bed rest (16,55). Consequently,
our data do not provide evidence that a decline in cap-
illary networks contributes to the rapid decline in whole-
body insulin sensitivity that was observed following 1
week of bed rest.
The magnitude of changes that we observed following
merely 1 week of bed rest underlines the impact of short-
term muscle disuse, as this study demonstrates that
1 week of bed rest can result in a similar amount of muscle
mass and strength loss as can be regained within months
of intense rehabilitation (35,44). These changes in lean
mass and muscle strength were observed despite our par-
ticipants being in energy balance, suggesting that the
impact of bed rest in undernourished individuals will
be even greater. Next to the decline in muscle mass
and function, the observed loss in metabolic health
during disuse is of paramount importance. By means of
comparison, the measured decline in insulin sensitivity
(i.e., ;30%) is similar to the difference between a normal
glucose-tolerant individual and a patient with type 2 diabetes
(52), and is equivalent to a decline that is observed following
;30–40 years of aging (23,61). As the decline in muscle mass,
strength, and peripheral insulin sensitivity have been shown

 to be good proxy markers for patient outcomes following
hospitalization (62), our results emphasize the impor-
tance of finding practical and effective interventional
strategies that can be applied immediately following
the onset of muscle disuse.
We conclude that short-term muscle disuse leads to
substantial declines in muscle mass and function and is
associated with the development of peripheral insulin
resistance and a decrease in skeletal muscle oxidative
capacity. Whereas we are still unclear on the molecular
mechanisms responsible, our findings clearly indicate
that intramuscular lipid accumulation (implicated in
high-fat diet–induced insulin resistance), impairments in
mitochondrial function and changes in capillary density
in skeletal muscle tissue cannot be held responsible for
the rapid onset of insulin resistance during a short period
of bed rest. Clearly, early interventions are warranted to
prevent or attenuate the negative functional and meta-
bolic consequences of short-term bed rest.
