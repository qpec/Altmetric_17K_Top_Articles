Background: We assessed the cancer risks of four different Finnish asbestos-exposed cohorts. We also
explored if the cohorts with varying profiles of asbestos exposure exhibited varying relative risks of cancer.
Methods: The incident cancer cases for the asbestos-exposed worker cohorts were updated to the end of
2012 using the files of the Finnish Cancer Registry. The previously formed cohorts consisted of asbestos
mine workers, asbestosis patients, asbestos sprayers, and workers who had taken part in a screening
study based on asbestos exposure at work.
Results: The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for mesothelioma varied from about threefold to > 100-
fold in the different cohorts. In the screening cohort the SIR for mesothelioma was highest in 2003e2007,
In other cohorts it was more constant in 5-year period inspection. The SIR for lung cancer was about
twofold to tenfold in all except the screening cohort. Asbestos sprayers were at the highest risk of
mesothelioma and lung cancer.
Conclusion: The SIR for mesothelioma is high in all of the cohorts that represent different kinds of
asbestos exposure. The smaller SIR for mesothelioma in the screening cohort with lowest level of
asbestos exposure might suggest dose-responsiveness between asbestos exposure and mesothelioma. It
does seem that the highest risk of lung cancer in these cohorts except in the youngest of the cohorts, the
screening cohort, is over. The highest SIR for lung cancer of the asbestosis patient and sprayers cohort is
explained by their heavy asbestos exposure.

1. Introduction
Asbestos is the name given to a group of naturally occurring
fibrous minerals. The two main groups of these minerals are
serpentine, which includes chrysotile; and amphiboles, which in-
cludes crocidolite, anthophyllite, and amosite. The adverse health
effects of asbestos have been known since the first half of the 20th
century. When handled, asbestos fibers may emanate into the air
and be easily inhaled. After inhalation, fibers end up in the smallest
bronchial tubes and the alveoli. They can also be transferred via the
lymphatic veins to different parts of the body. Asbestos exposure
may cause, for example, pleural plaques, pleural effusion, pulmo-
nary fibrosis (asbestosis), lung cancer, and mesothelioma of the
pleura or peritoneum. The Helsinki Criteria for the diagnosis and
attribution of asbestos were updated in 2014. Laryngeal and ovarian
cancers were considered asbestos-caused diseases [1,2];
the
International Agency for Research of Cancer (IARC) found sufficient
evidence of asbestos causation of these cancers in humans [3,4].
The latency period of asbestos diseases is from 10 years to 40
years or even longer. All types of asbestos fibers are known to cause
health hazards, crocidolite being the most potent. After the wide-
spread use of asbestos in the 20th century, hundreds of thousands of
workers in industrialized countries have contracted an asbestos-
related disease. According to the World Health Organization
(WHO) estimates, > 107,000 people die each year from asbestos-
related lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis resulting from
occupational exposures [5].
In Finland, unlike in other countries, anthophyllite asbestos has
been widely used because of its domestic production in the Paakkila
and Maljasalmi mines in 1918‒1975. Approximately 40% of all
asbestos used in Finland was anthophyllite. Finland also imported
asbestos in the forms of chrysotile, amosite, and crocidolite. Asbestos

 was widely used in construction materials, especially during the
1960s and 1970s. Although all uses of asbestos were banned by 1994
in Finland, it is estimated that half of the asbestos that was previ-
ously used in construction is still in place. Due to earlier asbestos
exposure, new asbestos-related diseases are still diagnosed in
Finland. The numbers of work-related asbestos-induced lung cancer
and mesothelioma cases show an almost flat trend, with w50 new
cases of lung cancer and 50 new cases of mesothelioma emerging
each year in Finland [6]. It is estimated that the incidence of meso-
thelioma and lung cancer will begin to diminish by the end of the
2010s. The number of registered asbestosis cases has already fallen
by w50% from the highest values of the mid-1990s.
In this study we assessed the cancer risks of four different Finnish
asbestos-exposed cohorts. Our main aim was to determine whether
the cessation of the use of asbestos some 20 years ago has affected
the risks of asbestos-related cancers. We also explored whether the
cohorts with somewhat varying profiles of asbestos exposure
exhibited varying relative risks of cancer and whether an excess of
cancers of the larynx or ovaries could be identified in these cohorts.
2. Materials and methods
Table 1 shows the number of workers in the different cohorts
and subcohorts, followup period, person-years, and the proportion
of men and tobacco smokers among the workers.
“Asbestos mine workers” is the oldest cohort, and comprises
workers of the former Paakkila and Maljasalmi anthophyllite
asbestos mines in Finland. The Paakkila mine began operating in
1918; Maljasalmi in 1943. A total of 734 workers were followed up:
they had been employed in these mines for at least 3 months be-
tween January 1953 and July 1967. Altogether 28% of the workers
were exposed for over 5 years. Workers of the mine and the refinery
were considered to have heavy asbestos exposure while the rest of
the personnel had moderate asbestos exposure. [7]. The Maljasalmi
mine was closed in 1953, and the Paakkila mine in 1975. It is
possible that these workers were also exposed to asbestos after-
wards in, for example, the construction industry.
The “asbestosis patient” cohort was formed in 1977‒1985, and
consisted of patients who visited the Finnish Institute of Occupa-
tional Health for a periodic health examination due to previously
diagnosed asbestosis. They had worked as insulation (53 workers),
asbestos mine (24 cases) or asbestos cement factory (24 cases)
workers, sprayers (14 cases), or in other asbestos-exposing work (13
cases). Their mean duration of asbestos exposure was 21 (range, 4‒
40) years. [8]
The “asbestos sprayer” cohort consisted of 133 asbestos sprayers
who were identified in 1987 from employee registers and other
sources. The mean duration of the asbestos exposure of the 60
sprayers who took part in the health examinations was 3 (range,
0.2‒13) years. Asbestos spraying with crocidolite was performed in
Finland between the years 1955 and 1976, after which spraying and
the use of crocidolite was prohibited [8].
The largest and most recent of the four cohorts is the “asbestos
screening” cohort.
The
asbestos-related
illnesses
of
exposed
workers were screened in Finland in 1990‒1992. A questionnaire
was sent to study participants, based on the registers of trade
unions and employment pension institutions. The final cohort
consisted of 24,214 people. At the time of the screening project, the
mean duration of work that exposed workers to asbestos was 26
years. A total of 71% of the workers of this cohort were construction
workers who had a history of at least 10 years of employment in the
construction industry, starting before 1980. Asbestos use in con-
struction materials in Finland ceased at the end of the 1980s, which
can be regarded as materially decreasing any potential exposure in
the construction industry. Of course, the material that was already
in place also contained asbestos, which may have caused some
exposure in renovation work even after the end of the 1980s. In
Finland, asbestos cement products were manufactured between
1923 and 1988. Asbestos cement contained 10‒15% chrysotile. In
shipbuilding, crocidolite asbestos was sprayed in 1955‒1975.
Boards containing amosite were used in the interior furnishing of
ships until the 1970s [9]. The screening cohort also had 672 workers
who participated voluntarily. Their interviewed asbestos exposure
was similar to the other workers’ in the cohort. There were also
5,693 workers who answered the preliminary questionnaire but
did not participate in the actual screening study. Their detailed
asbestos exposure remained unclear, although they had been
employed in asbestos exposing industry over 10 years [10].
The participants were identified and followed up for death and
emigration in 1967e1994 via the Population Register Centre, using
the unique identification number given to everyone residing in
Finland since January 1, 1967 as the key. Three men from the cohort
of asbestos sprayers had to be excluded because of missing iden-
tification data. Follow-up for cancer was carried out automatically
using the files of the Finnish Cancer Registry. The follow-up started
on January 1, 1967; on January 1 of the year following the first
periodic health examination since 1977 for the asbestosis patients,
on January 1 of the year following the year of first employment as
an asbestos sprayer, or from the date of screening. or from January 1
1991 for the screening cohort. The calculation of person-years
ended at emigration or death, or on December 31, 2012, which-
ever occurred first. The number of incident cancer cases and the
person-years at risk, were counted separately for 5-year (1st period
6 years) calendar periods (1967e1972, 1973e1977, 1978‒1982,

 1983‒1987, 1988‒1992, 1993‒1997, 1998‒2002, 2003‒2007, and
2008‒2012). The expected numbers of cases for total cancer and
specific cancer types were calculated by multiplying the number of
person-years in each age group by the corresponding average
cancer incidence in Finland during the period of observation.
As we did not know the smoking habits of the workers after the
cohorts were formed, we analyzed smokers and ex-smokers
together. As no smoking-specific reference data were available for
cancer incidence, the smoking-specific risks of cancer were calcu-
lated using the expected numbers of the general Finnish population.
To calculate the standardized incidence ratio (SIR), the observed
number of cases was divided by the expected number. Exact 95%
confidence intervals (CI) were defined on the presumption that the
number of observed cases followed a Poisson distribution.
3. Results
3.1. Mesothelioma
There were altogether 108 mesotheliomas during the follow-up
period. The SIR varied from about threefold to > 100-fold in the
different cohorts (Table 2). Table 3 shows the SIRs for mesothelioma
and lung cancer in the four cohorts in the 5-year calendar periods of
the follow-up. The asbestos mine workers’ as well as asbestosis
patients’ and sprayers’ SIRs for mesothelioma have been highest in
the 1980s and 1990s. In the screening cohort the highest SIR for
mesothelioma was in the beginning of this century.
3.2. Lung cancer
During the follow-up, we observed a total of 1,135 lung cancers
among men and women in these four cohorts (Table 2). The SIRs for
lung cancer to be seen in the 5-year period inspection seem to have
diminished since late 1990s in all except the screening cohort
(Table 3).
The screening cohort had 6,197 cancer cases in all and 994 lung
cancer cases (SIR 1.23, 95% CI 1.16e1.30; Table 2). Table 4 presents
lung cancer SIRs in the different cohorts and subcohorts. The
highest SIRs for lung cancer were among smokers in these different
exposure groups except for the asbestos sprayer cohort.
3.3. Other cancers
Table 5 shows the SIRs for all sites cancer in the different cohorts
according to smoking status.
We
observed
three
laryngeal
cancer
cases
among
the
nonsmoking men and women of the screening cohort (SIR 0.26,
95% CI 0.05e0.77), 34 cases among the smokers (SIR 1.31, 95% CI
0.90e1.82), and 15 cases among those whose smoking status was
unknown (SIR 1.40, 95% CI 0.78e2.31). In other cohorts, only one
case of laryngeal cancer was observed (data not shown).
Six cases of cancer of the ovaries were observed, all of which
were in the screening cohort. Of these, four were among the non-
smokers (SIR 1.14, 95% CI 0.31e2.92) and two were among the
smokers (SIR 1.02, 95% CI 0.12e3.67; data not shown).
4. Discussion
The first mesothelioma cases in the asbestos mine worker
cohort exposed to anthophyllite asbestos occurred in the 1980s,
which reflects the long latency period of mesothelioma, as the
asbestos exposure of some of the workers had begun already in
1918 and ceased by 1975. Karjalainen et al [11] reported the first
four mesotheliomas in this cohort and calculated the latency period
to be 39‒58 years. The asbestos sprayers were at the highest risk of
mesothelioma. This can be explained by their earlier exposure to
high concentrations of crocidolite asbestos, which is considered the
most potential type of asbestos to cause health problems. The
asbestos exposure of the screening cohort workers varied accord-
ing to their profession and working years, and the cohort also
included less exposed workers. Part of the asbestos used in con-
struction was chrysotile, which is regarded to be less potent in

 causing mesothelioma [4]. The question still remains, however, as
to why the mesothelioma risk in the screening cohort is lower than
that in the other cohorts. It is unclear whether the level of asbestos
exposure has affected the risk of mesothelioma, but a recent French
study found a clear dose-response relationship between occupa-
tional asbestos exposure and pleural mesothelioma [12]. One
earlier study [13] showed a doseeresponse relationship between
mesothelioma risk and the asbestos fiber concentration of lung
tissue. In the future we will see whether the risk increases in the
screening cohort, or stays lower, which would support the theory of
dose-responsiveness.
The SIRs for mesothelioma have been constant in the asbestos
mine workers and sprayers cohorts (Table 3). There is no clear trend
of the SIR for mesothelioma either in the asbestosis patient cohort,
where the asbestos exposure ceased at the latest in 1985; because
of the disease, they were not at work anymore. The SIR for meso-
thelioma in the screening cohort was highest in 2003e2007. The
cohorts are heterogenic regarding the beginning and ending of the
workers’ asbestos exposure, which with the very variable latency
period of mesothelioma makes it impossible to make conclusions of
when the mesothelioma risk starts to diminish after the ending of
asbestos exposure. The overall incidence of pleural mesothelioma
has been constant in Finland in recent years, whereas in Sweden,
for example, it has been decreasing since the asbestos ban in 1982,
12 years earlier than in Finland (Fig. 1) [14].
A previous study [16] showed that the workers of the asbestos
mine and associated factory had excess overall mortality for lung
cancer already in 1936‒1966, after rather a short period of asbestos
exposure. In this cohort, the prevalence of smoking among men
was 81%. Fourteen percent of the female workers smoked. Ac-
cording to Rimpelä [17], w60% of Finnish men smoked in the early
1960s. Thus smoking plays an important role in the excess risk of
lung cancer, perhaps amplifying the effect of anthophyllite expo-
sure. The lung cancer risk is smaller in the asbestos mine workers
cohort than in the asbestosis patients and sprayers cohorts. Rather
than being a sign of a smaller carcinogenicity of anthophyllite
asbestos, this is likely due to different grades of asbestos exposure
among workers of the mines. The measurements made in the
enrichment plant in Paakkila mine showed 200 anthophyllite fibers
in cm3 before 1970 [18], but of course the level of the asbestos
exposure depended on the working time and the particular duty in
the mine. According to an article published in 1968 [19], the
number of workers in Paakkila mine was 132, 12 of whom were
white collar workers. As the cohort was formed of people who had
worked in Paakkila and Maljasalmi mines in 1953e1967 and Mal-
jasalmi was closed already in 1953, there were also those who had
worked for a shorter time and thus were less exposed in this cohort.
That would explain the smaller SIR for lung cancer of this cohort,
compared with asbestosis patients and sprayers, who are known to
have a heavy asbestos exposure.
Asbestosis patients’ risk of lung cancer is high. This is logical,
because the development of asbestosis is known to require heavy
asbestos exposure. The higher the asbestos exposure, the higher the
risk of lung cancer, regardless of smoking. The highest observed risk
of lung cancer was among asbestos sprayers. Sprayers were
exposed to high concentrations (as measured, up to 100 fibers per
cm3; [9]) of crocidolite. The SIR for lung cancer in the screening
cohort,
which
mainly consisted
of
construction workers,
is
moderately increased. The asbestos exposure of workers in this
cohort was very heterogenic, which probably explains why their
overall risk was lower than that in the other cohorts. However, the
SIR for lung cancer of nonsmokers is surprisingly low, although we
have no nonsmoking population to compare it with. As detected
earlier [10], the SIR for lung cancer was higher (Table 3) among
those who only answered the preliminary questionnaire and did
not participate in the actual study. Not participating may reflect the
fact that they were not so interested in health issues and therefore,
might have had an unhealthier lifestyle, which also elevates the

 overall risk of cancer. Nevertheless, in the screening cohort, the SIR
for lung cancer was still at the same level as it was over 25 years ago
(Table 3). Exposure to asbestos continued until at least 1994 in this
cohort, so the cancer risk is expected to start to decrease in the near
future.
As we do not know the smoking habits of the workers after the
cohorts were formed, we analyzed the smokers and ex-smokers
together. Although it is of course possible that smoking habits
changed later, it is less probable that nonsmokers started smoking,
because active campaigning against it has been targeted at
asbestos-exposed workers [20]. In the screening cohort, the prev-
alence of smoking was similar to that of the Finnish general pop-
ulation in 1979 [8].
We found no increased risk of ovarian cancer or laryngeal cancer
in these asbestos-exposed cohorts. The total number of women was
small (1,091). Most of them (539 women) worked in the construc-
tion industry, where asbestos exposure in typical women’s work
was probably low. Why the asbestosis patient and sprayer cohorts
had no cases of laryngeal cancer and why there was only one in the
asbestos mine worker cohort is explained by the small sizes of these
cohorts and the relative rarity of laryngeal cancer. Although the
evidence of an increased risk of laryngeal cancer associated with
asbestos exposure [1] is consistent, even in our largest cohort the
risk remained at the same level as that of the overall population.
It has to be kept in mind that overall SIRs of different cohorts are
not directly comparable even in this case when the reference
incidence rates for all cohorts are derived from the same popula-
tion, if the person-year distributions of the cohorts are different in
terms of calendar period or age. Therefore we stratified our data
according to these variables and compared SIRs in a given calendar
period and age range in each of the cohorts.
As a conclusion, even if the SIRs for mesothelioma are high, the
number of cases per year is small. Asbestos sprayers, who had been
exposed to high amounts of crocidolite, were at the highest risk of
mesothelioma and lung cancer. The smaller SIR for mesothelioma
in the screening cohort would suggest dose-responsiveness of
asbestos exposure. It does seem that, the highest risk of lung cancer
in the older cohorts is over, but remains elevated in the most recent
of the cohorts, the screening cohort. The highest SIR for lung cancer
is in the asbestosis patient and sprayers cohort, which is explained
by their heavy asbestos exposure. We did not find an increased risk
of ovarian cancer, or laryngeal cancer in these asbestos-exposed
cohorts.
