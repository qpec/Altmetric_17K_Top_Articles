ABSTRACT
Objective: To determine whether 24-h availability of physiotherapy services decreases 
ICU costs in comparison with the standard 12 h/day availability among patients admitted to 
the ICU for the fi
 rst time. Methods: This was an observational prevalence study involving 
815 patients ≥ 18 years of age who had been on invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) for 
≥ 24 h and were discharged from an ICU to a ward at a tertiary teaching hospital in Brazil. 
The patients were divided into two groups according to h/day availability of physiotherapy 
services in the ICU: 24 h (PT-24; n = 332); and 12 h (PT-12; n = 483). The data collected 
included the reasons for hospital and ICU admissions; Acute Physiology and Chronic 
Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score; IMV duration, ICU length of stay (ICU-LOS); and 
Omega score. Results: The severity of illness was similar in both groups. Round-the-
clock availability of physiotherapy services was associated with shorter IMV durations 
and ICU-LOS, as well as with lower total, medical, and staff costs, in comparison with 
the standard 12 h/day availability. Conclusions: In the population studied, total costs and 
staff costs were lower in the PT-24 group than in the PT-12 group. The h/day availability 
of physiotherapy services was found to be a signifi
 cant predictor of ICU costs.

INTRODUCTION
The ICU is considered the most costly hospital 
department. For example, in Germany, it has been 
estimated that the ICU accounts for 20% of all hospital 
costs.(1) Because critical care is a crucial hospital service, 
the factors that impact ICU costs have been widely 
studied. The total cost per patient in the ICU depends 
largely on the severity of illness and the ICU length of 
stay (ICU-LOS).(2-4) However, there have been very few 
studies looking into cost of ICU in Brazil. Nangino et al.(5) 
calculated the fi
 nancial impact of nosocomial infections 
in the ICU at a charitable hospital in the Brazilian state 
of Minas Gerais. The authors reported longer ICU-LOS, 
higher per-patient ICU expenditures, and higher per-day 
ICU expenditures for patients with infection than for 
those without. Nevertheless, it is important to consider 
the heterogeneity among countries, and even within 
a country, in terms of the allocation of resources, 
distribution of critical care services, personnel costs, 
drug prices, culture, and the ethical standards of the 
society in relation to health care.(6)
Prolonged ICU-LOS has been associated with a longer 
duration of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV).(7) 
Approximately 33% of patients admitted to the ICU 
require IMV,(8,9) which has been associated with higher 
mortality,(10) a higher incidence of hospital-associated 
pneumonia,(11) and ICU-acquired muscle weakness.(12) 
The use of IMV is also associated with higher costs,(13) 
accounting for 12% of all hospital costs.(14) Therefore, it 
seems that strategies to improve the weaning process 
and reduce IMV duration would reduce costs(11) and 
improve long-term patient outcomes.(15)
The aim of physiotherapy in the ICU is to enhance 
the overall functional capacity of patients, as well as to 
restore respiratory and physical independence, thereby 
decreasing the risk of bed rest-associated complications.
(15) However, it is important to understand that the role 
of physiotherapists in the ICU varies considerably among 
countries and depends on such factors as staffi
 ng levels, 
training, and expertise.(16) In Brazil, physiotherapists are 
in charge of respiratory care and employ mobilization 
techniques. Respiratory care includes lung expansion, 
bronchial hygiene, assisted cough, suction, oxygen 
delivery, implementing/monitoring noninvasive mechanical 
ventilation, adjusting/monitoring IMV, participating in 
the weaning process, and extubation.(17) Mobilization 
techniques consist in the following(18): general exercises, 
such as passive, assisted, active, and resistive maneuvers;

transference training; positioning the patient when 
sitting; and providing ambulation therapy as soon 
as possible.
Although growing interest in reducing costs for patients 
requiring long-term mechanical ventilation has led to 
the development of various models of care delivery, 
none of those models have been tested in scientifi
 cally 
rigorous studies.(19,20) Brazilian law requires that ICU 
teams include one physiotherapist for every 10 patients 
for at least 18 h/day.(17,21) However
, fi
 nancial pressures, 
coupled with increasing expectations from regulators, 
payers, and consumers are changing health care 
delivery systems. Integrated, outcome-based systems 
of care delivery are needed.(19) During the process of 
adapting to the law, ICU patients at our hospital were 
seen by a physiotherapist on a 12 h/day shift basis. 
Our hospital has chosen to implement a 24 h/day, 
rather than an 18 h/day, physiotherapy schedule, in 
order to facilitate the organization of routines and to 
match the hours of public transportation. Therefore, 
the current study aimed to investigate the benefi
 ts 
and costs of this change, comparing ICUs with 24-h 
availability of physiotherapy services and those with 
12-h availability of physiotherapy services in terms 
of the costs incurred for patients admitted to the ICU 
for the fi
 rst time.
METHODS
Procedures
This observational prevalence study was conducted 
at the Hospital das Clínicas of the University of São 
Paulo School of Medicine, in the city of São Paulo, 
Brazil. The hospital has 125 ICU beds distributed 
among 11 ICUs. Three ICUs with a total of 53 beds 
were provided with physiotherapy services for 24 h/
day (PT-24 group), and eight ICUs with a total of 72 
beds were provided with physiotherapy services for 
12 h/day (PT-12 group). 
All patients received physiotherapy in the ICU from 
the local staff, which comprised professionals certifi
 ed 
to treat critically ill patients. Each physiotherapist 
treated an average of 10 patients during each 6-h shift. 
Physiotherapy sessions averaged 30 min in length, 
depending on the needs of the patient. During the 
data collection period, the physiotherapists continued 
their normal routine in the ICU, and no new treatment 
protocols were introduced.
Data were collected from December 1, 2009, to 
September 31, 2011. The study was approved by 
the local research ethics committee (Protocol no. 
1159/07). The requirement for written consent was 
waived, because the study analysis was based on 
secondary data.
For the patients who met the inclusion criteria listed 
below, data were collected from patient charts. To 
facilitate access to clinical information, we collected 
data for the period from ICU admission until 48 h after 
discharge to a ward. All data were collected by four 
trained researchers. 
Participants
The study included clinical and surgical patients who 
were between 18 and 90 years of age at their fi
 rst 
admission to the ICU, had been on IMV for ≥ 24 h, and 
were subsequently discharged to a ward. In the case of 
surgical patients, we included only those who received 
IMV exclusively because of surgery. Mechanically 
ventilated patients were specifi
 cally chosen because 
this group is the most common target for ICU-LOS 
reductions, given the many available interventions that 
can shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation use. 
Surgical patients with a history of neuromuscular 
disease, neurodegenerative disease, high spinal 
cord injury, or tetanus were excluded because of the 
possibility of prolonged mechanical ventilation. Burn 
patients were excluded because they were admitted 
exclusively to a PT-12 ICU and underwent multiple 
surgical procedures for resurfacing, making it impossible 
to draw comparison with patients who underwent other 
types of surgical procedures. Patients who had been 
referred from another facility were excluded, because 
of the diffi
 culties of accessing the data of interest. We 
also excluded patients who were on IMV prior to surgery, 
not only because such patients represent a minority 
but also because they present multiple complications. 
Patients who remained in the ICU for more than three 
months were also excluded, as were obstetric patients, 
patients who were transferred out of the ICU to other 
institutions, patients who died in the ICU, and patients 
for whom the medical records were incomplete. Patients 
were included in the study only once, even if they were 
readmitted to the ICU after discharge.
Measures
The following information were collected from the 
medical records: age; gender; Acute Physiology and 
Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score; IMV 
duration; ICU-LOS; number of respiratory and motor 
physiotherapy sessions during the ICU stay; and 
Omega score.(22)
The Omega system was created by the French 
Intensive Care Society.(22) The Omega score refl
 ects 
the workload required for each indicated procedure. 
The Omega system, which is similar to the Therapeutic 
Intervention Scoring System,(23) has been shown 
to be highly accurate for estimating workloads and 
costs. 
(22) The Omega system evaluates 47 diagnostic or 
therapeutic procedures, divided into three categories. 
Omega 1 includes general procedures (e.g., intubation, 
vasoactive drug administration, and chest tubes), 
which are recorded only once during the ICU stay. 
Omega 2 includes diagnostic procedures and transport 
out of the unit (e.g., for radiography or endoscopy), 
which are recorded each time they are performed. 
Omega 3 includes procedures related to mechanical 
ventilation and monitoring, which are recorded daily 
throughout the ICU stay. The procedures listed in 
Omega 3 are closely related to physiotherapy practices 
in ICUs in Brazil. The total Omega score is obtained by 
calculating the sum of the scores for Omega 1, 2, and 
185

 Relationship between availability of physiotherapy services and ICU costs
3.(22) After calculating the Omega score, we converted 
the estimated cost to French francs (FF), using the 
regression equations reported by Sznajder et al.(22) 
Those authors developed three regression equations 
to estimate the costs in FF:
Direct costs = 211.68 × total Omega score + 1,191.5
Medical costs = 124.4 × total Omega score
Nursing staff costs = 67 × total Omega score
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was performed using the 
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 
15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and the program 
R for Windows, version 3.2.3 (R Development Core 
Team—www.r-project.org). The descriptive analyses of 
the continuous variables were presented as the mean 
± standard deviation, median (interquartile range), 
or absolute and relative frequency, as appropriate 
according to the distribution of the data. Normality 
tests revealed nonparametric distributions for most 
of the variables in both groups (PT-12 and PT-24). 
Therefore, the Mann-Whitney U test was used in order 
to compare the difference between the two groups. 
Standard multiple linear regression analysis was 
performed in order to develop a model for predicting ICU 
costs based on the h/day availability of physiotherapy 
services in the ICU (PT-12 = 0; PT-24 = 1); APACHE 
II score; surgical procedure(4) (no = 0; yes = 1); and 
ICU-LOS, in days.(2-4) Those variables were selected 
on the basis of clinical criteria. Prior to interpreting 
the results of the multiple regression analysis, we 
evaluated some assumptions. Stem-and-leaf plots and 
box plots indicated that the variables in regression were 
not normally distributed, which required logarithmic 
transformation of the variables. The level of signifi
 cance 
was set at p < 0.05.
RESULTS
We evaluated a total of 10,654 records of patients 
admitted to the ICU during the study period (Figure 1). 
Of those 10,654 patients, 815 met the inclusion criteria: 
483 in the PT-12 group and 332 in the PT-24 group.
The general characteristics of the patients are shown 
in Table 1. The h/day availability of physiotherapy 
services was not determined by the type of ICU (surgical 
or clinical). The proportions of surgical patients in the 
PT-12 and PT-24 groups are also presented in Table 1. 
In both groups, males predominated. There was no 
statistical difference between the groups in terms of 
the severity of illness, as determined by the APACHE 
II score, at ICU admission (p = 0.65). However, the 
patients in the PT-24 group were signifi
 cantly older 
than were those in the PT-12 group (p < 0.001). In 
addition, the duration of IMV was signifi
 cantly shorter in 
the PT-24 group than in the PT-12 group (p < 0.001), 
as was the ICU-LOS (p = 0.013).
Table 2 presents the ICU costs calculated for the 
PT-12 and PT-24 groups. The Omega 3 score was 
signifi
 cantly lower in the PT-24 group than in the PT-12 
group (p=0.005), as were the total Omega score, total 
costs, medical costs, and staff costs (p = 0.010 for all). 
Standardized regression coeffi
 cients (β) and squared 
semipartial correlations (sr2) for each predictor in the 
multiple linear regression model are shown in Table 
3. The h/day availability of physiotherapy services 
in the ICU, APACHE II score, and ICU-LOS were all 
found to be signifi
 cant predictors of ICU costs. The 
model was able to account for 72% of the variance 
in ICU costs (p = 0.05; R2 = 0.72): ICU costs(y) = 
4.800 + 0.010*(APACHE II score) + 0.045*(ICU-
LOS) − 0.070*(h/day availability of physiotherapy 
services).
DISCUSSION
Our fi
 ndings suggest that the estimated cost per 
patient in a fi
 rst admission to the ICU is reduced 
when physiotherapy services are available around 
the clock rather than for only 12 h per day. That 
conclusion is based on the lower Omega 3 and total 
Omega scores, as well as the lower direct, medical, 
and nursing staff costs associated with the PT-24

condition.(24) We also demonstrated that IMV duration 
and ICU-LOS were shorter in the PT-24 group. In 
addition, APACHE II scores, ICU-LOS, and the h/day 
availability of physiotherapy services were found to 
be signifi
 cant predictors of ICU costs. In particular, 
the relationship between the h/day availability of 
physiotherapy services and ICU costs was inversely 
proportional, meaning that the more physiotherapy 
patients receive during their fi
 rst ICU stay, the lower 
are the hospital costs. However, higher APACHE II 
scores and prolonged ICU-LOS were found to translate 
to higher hospitalization costs. To our knowledge, this 
is the fi
 rst study to examine ICU costs based on the 
h/day availability of physiotherapy services.
Although the Omega score has not been validated 
for use in Brazil (i.e., with Brazilian currency), it 
was chosen because it is easy to use and refl
 ects 
the workloads associated with caring for critically ill 
patients.(25) In addition, the Omega 3 score is based on 
procedures that are closely related to those employed 
by physiotherapists working in ICUs in Brazil. The 
need for cost calibration is inherent to all methods 
used to estimate costs in critical care,(25) such as 
the Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System(23) and 
activity-based costing.(26) When comparing results 
for different countries, factors such as the exchange 
rate must be considered, and the measurements 
must refl
 ect purchasing power—comparing costs and 
resources rather than expenses.(27)
The Omega 3 score evaluates procedures such as 
mechanical ventilation and continuous surveillance 
in the ICU. In the current study, the Omega 3 score 
was lower in the PT-24 group than in the PT-12 group, 
because of the shorter IMV duration and ICU-LOS in the 
former
. In Brazil, the role of the physiotherapist in the 
ICU includes implementing and monitoring noninvasive 
mechanical ventilation; adjusting and monitoring IMV; 
participating in the weaning process; and extubation. 
In the current study, round-the-clock ICU availability of 
physiotherapy services was found to accelerate weaning 
and to improve IMV management, thereby decreasing 
the IMV duration, in comparison with ICU availability of 
physiotherapy services for only 12 h per day. In addition, 
it is well known that IMV duration is an independent 
predictor of hospital and ICU costs.(13) Our results are 
in line with those of a similar study, comparing 24 h/
day and 6 h/day availability of physiotherapy services 
for ICU patients in Brazil.(28) That study showed that 
round-the-clock availability of physiotherapy services 
reduces the ICU-LOS, IMV duration, pulmonary infection

 Relationship between availability of physiotherapy services and ICU costs
rate, and mortality rate. However
, the authors of that 
study did not include a cost analysis of physiotherapy 
services, as some other authors have done.(29)
As previously mentioned, the total Omega score 
is the sum of the Omega 1, Omega 2, and Omega 3 
scores. Because there were no differences between 
our two groups in terms of the Omega 1 or Omega 
2 score, differences in the Omega 3 scores account 
for the difference in the total Omega score. The 
regressions postulated by Sznajder et al.(22) are based 
on the use of the total Omega score to calculate the 
total, medical, and staff costs. It is important to 
note that the Omega system does not include the 
workload of the physiotherapist. In our study, both 
groups were given access to a physiotherapist from 
the multidisciplinary team for either 12 h/day or 24 h/
day. Therefore, it should also be noted that providing 
round-the-clock physiotherapy services contributed to 
reducing the overall workload of the team, as refl
 ected 
in the signifi
 cant differences between the two groups 
in terms of medical and staff costs.
Despite our positive results, there are still confl
 icting 
data in the literature regarding the impacts that 
respiratory care and chest physiotherapy have on 
clinical outcomes and cost analyses. One previous 
report showed that chest physiotherapy delivered twice 
a day to patients who had been on IMV for at least 48 
h was independently associated with a reduction in the 
incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia.(29) In a 
study conducted in Spain, Varela et al.(30) also reported 
that providing chest physiotherapy for pulmonary 
lobectomy patients on the ward can shorten hospital 
stays, resulting in savings equivalent to FF 41,084.69. 
However, studies conducted in other countries, such 
as Australia and England, have shown that, among 
critically ill patients admitted to medical or surgical 
ICUs, physiotherapy has no effect on the frequency 
of ventilator-associated pneumonia,(31) mortality, 
ICU-LOS,(29,30,32) or IMV duration.(29,31,33)
It is particularly challenging to perform outcome 
studies of physiotherapy in the ICU. The population 
admitted to the ICU is quite diverse, and the combination 
of patient characteristics, socioeconomic profi
 le, 
clinical conditions, and ICU setting can alter outcomes 
in the critical care area. The most well-accepted 
recommendations regarding physiotherapy in ICU 
are related to the weaning process.(31) For example, 
the European Respiratory Society and the European 
Society of Intensive Care Medicine recommend the 
active participation of a physiotherapist in the weaning 
process,(32,34) because it can optimize weaning from 
IMV, as was shown in the current study. 
The lack of agreement across studies could be related 
to the complexity of patient health conditions and the 
diversity of the health care systems in different settings 
and countries. For example, our hospital is a referral 
center for South America and a tertiary teaching 
hospital. Consequently, patients who present to our 
hospital have multiple comorbidities, are severely ill, 
and have a prolonged ICU-LOS. We found that, in 
addition to reducing IMV duration and ICU-LOS, greater 
availability of physiotherapy services was a signifi
 cant 
predictor of reduced ICU costs, as were lower APACHE 
II scores and shorter ICU-LOS. 
Despite the importance of the results, our study has 
some limitations that should be considered. First, the 
Omega system has not been validated for use in Brazil, 
and conversion to the local currency to estimate the 
fi
 nancial savings for Brazilian hospitals cannot occur 
without a cost calibration. Therefore, the interpretation 
of these data should consider the cost variation between 
the two dates, 1992 (when the Omega system was 
devised) and 2011 (when the data collection process 
for the current study was fi
 nalized), based on infl
 ation 
indices (e.g., consumer price indices), which represent 
the evolution of the cost of living. Infl
 ation over that 
period in France was 37.92%. In 1992, 6.9 FF would 
have been equal to 1 euro. Second, the study was not 
designed to examine quality improvements (pre- and 
post-intervention). We compared different ICUs at the 
same time during the transition to 24-h physiotherapy 
shifts at our hospital. As a result, the data were not 
collected from standardized groups. Third, because 
the study was conducted at a general hospital, 
heterogeneous diagnoses could have interfered with 
our results. Nevertheless, the role of the physiotherapist 
and the clinical routine are the same in all units; we 
considered it more important to differentiate between 
clinical and surgical patients than to determine patient 
diagnoses. It is also worth noting that the severity 
of illness was similar in both of the groups in our 
sample. In addition, we excluded all patients with a 
higher probability of prolonged ICU-LOS; however
, the 
literature indicates that mechanical ventilation weaning 
times are longer in such patients, due to previous 
disease, rather than to respiratory failure (the reason 
for intubation).(7,10) Another limitation is related to the 
potential lack of external validity of our fi
 ndings, given 
the extensive list of exclusion criteria. Finally, some 
authors have questioned the use of log transformation 
and its implications for data analysis, arguing that 
the results of standard statistical tests performed on 
log-transformed data are often not relevant for the 
original, non-transformed data.(35,36) However, log 
transformation is one of the most popular methods 
of transforming skewed data in order to approximate 
normality. If the original data follow a log-normal or 
approximately log-normal distribution, which was 
the case in our study, then the log-transformed data 
follow a normal or near normal distribution (the 
log transformation does in fact reduce or eliminate 
skewness).(34,37)
In the population studied, ICUs with round-the-clock 
availability of physiotherapy services presented lower 
IMV durations and ICU-LOS, as well as lower total, 
medical, and staff costs, in comparison with ICUs in 
which physiotherapy services were available for the 
standard 12 h/day. Providing ICU patients with 24-h 
access to physiotherapy services was found to be a 
signifi
 cant predictor of lower ICU costs.
