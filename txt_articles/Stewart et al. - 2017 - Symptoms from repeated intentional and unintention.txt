Symptoms from repeated intentional and
unintentional head impact in soccer
players
ABSTRACT
Objective: To determine the rate and differential contribution of heading vs unintentional head im-
pacts (e.g., head to head, goal post) to CNS symptoms in adult amateur soccer players.
Methods: Amateur soccer players completed baseline and serial on-line 2-week recall question-
naires (HeadCount) and reported (1) soccer practice and games, (2) heading and unintentional
soccer head trauma, and (3) frequency and severity (mild to very severe) of CNS symptoms. For
analysis, CNS symptoms were affirmed if one or more moderate, severe, or very severe episodes
were reported in a 2-week period. Repeated measures logistic regression was used to assess if
2-week heading exposure (i.e., 4 quartiles) or unintentional head impacts (i.e., 0, 1, 21) were
associated with CNS symptoms.
Results: A total of 222 soccer players (79% male) completed 470 HeadCount questionnaires.
Mean (median) heading/2 weeks was 44 (18) for men and 27 (9.5) for women. One or more unin-
tentional head impacts were reported by 37% of men and 43% of women. Heading-related symp-
toms were reported in 20% (93 out of 470) of the HeadCounts. Heading in the highest quartile
was significantly associated with CNS symptoms (odds ratio [OR] 3.17, 95% confidence interval
[CI] 1.57–6.37) when controlling for unintentional exposure. Those with 21 unintentional expo-
sures were at increased risk for CNS symptoms (OR 6.09, 95% CI 3.33–11.17) as were those
with a single exposure (OR 2.98, 95% CI 1.69–5.26) when controlling for heading.
Conclusions: Intentional (i.e., heading) and unintentional head impacts are each independently
associated with moderate to very severe CNS symptoms. Neurology® 2017;88:901–908

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in athletes is a recognized public health concern.1–6 Soccer, the
most popular sport worldwide,7 may account for the dominant share of subconcussive exposure
in sports, where excess heading (more than 1,000 per year) may be a cause of subclinical brain
injury, effects that were not explained by history of recognized concussion.8 Although published
studies have focused on collegiate and professional players,9–14 most soccer players are amateur
recreational league players.
Most studies of head injury in other sports have focused on single or repeated concussive
injury episodes, now known to cause chronic brain pathology,15 especially in susceptible indi-
viduals.16–21 Recently, it was suggested that persistent CNS effects from soccer in adolescents
were explained by collision-related injuries, not heading.22 However, because heading was not
assessed in this study it was not possible to parse attribution to unintentional vs intentional head
impacts9,23–28 or exposures that also occur during practice.20
Using data from a 2-week recall3,4 questionnaire, we examined the short-term relation of
intentional (i.e., heading) and unintentional (i.e., head to head, head to goalpost, etc.) head
impacts with CNS symptoms among amateur soccer players.

 METHODS The Einstein Soccer Study is a multifaceted longi-
tudinal study of heading and its consequences in adult amateur
soccer players. We used data from one substudy, where soccer
players
were
recruited
over
a
9-month
period
between
November 2013 and July 2014 and asked to complete one or
more serial 2-week recall questionnaires on soccer activity,
heading, and other head impacts.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. The Albert Einstein College of Medicine institutional
review board approved the study. All participants gave written
informed consent at time of enrollment.
Questionnaire development. The 2-week recall questionnaire
design was guided by 2 focus groups with adult amateur soccer
players intended to elucidate (1) types of heading and other
head
impacts
that
occur
during
soccer,
(2)
symptoms
experienced from heading, and (3) questionnaire language that
would resonate with soccer players. Participants were asked to
write actions they engage in while on the field and how they
would describe heading and any sensations or symptoms
experienced
following
heading,
as
well
as
unintentional
impacts. Discussion covered terms that could be used as scale
anchors for the least and greatest severity of heading-related
sensations/symptoms.
HeadCount, a self-administered questionnaire, was designed
to assess head impacts and associated symptoms. We selected
a 2-week recall period, vs 1 week or 4 weeks, as short enough
for soccer players to accurately recall recent activity but long
enough to capture a meaningful amount of soccer activity.3,4
Two-week recall questionnaire. HeadCount was imple-
mented as a web-based questionnaire, beginning with a single
yes/no question on soccer activity. HeadCount, completed as
a web-based questionnaire, was organized into 5 modules
focused on outdoor practice, outdoor games, indoor practice,
indoor games, and unintentional head impacts. Identical
questions are repeated for outdoor and indoor settings and
include any practice sessions, number of soccer practice days,
average number of headings during practice in the past 2
weeks, and CNS symptoms. Participants were asked how often
(0–51 episodes) in the past 2 weeks they experienced heading
temporally associated with symptoms, defined as very low impact
(no pain 5 0), mild impact (slight pain 5 1), moderate impact
(moderate pain, some dizziness 5 2), severe impact (felt dazed,
stopped play, needed medical attention 5 3), and very severe
impact (knocked unconscious 5 4).
For indoor and outdoor competition, questions were asked
about the number of competitive soccer games, positions played
during games, and average number of headings during games.
For all soccer activities in the last 2 weeks, participants were
asked how often they experienced unintentional head impacts
from specific causes (e.g., ball hitting to the back of the head,
head to goal post, head to head). Finally, questions were asked
about lifetime head injuries.
Any head injury not related to soccer was assessed using a life-
time head injury questionnaire.
Anthropomorphic measurements. Standardized protocols
were used to measure height, weight, neck circumference, neck
length, and head circumference in each participant. Cylindrical
neck volume was estimated as follows:

Neck-circumference2�

Study population and data collection. Adult amateur soccer
players were recruited by print and Internet advertisement and
through soccer leagues, clubs, and colleges in New York City
and surrounding areas. Interested individuals were directed to
an enrollment website, which, after informed consent, collected
screening information. Inclusion criteria were age 18–55 years,
at least 5 years of active amateur soccer play, current active ama-
teur soccer play, 6 months of amateur soccer play per year, and
English language fluency. Exclusion criteria were schizophrenia,
bipolar disorder, known neurologic disorder, pregnancy, and
medical contraindication to MRI (relevant to a separate arm of
the study). A research team member contacted qualifying indi-
viduals, confirmed eligibility and willingness to participate in the
full longitudinal study, and invited enrollment. Refusals were
defined as individuals who completed a screener form but could
not be contacted afterwards, refused to participate, or withdrew
from the study without completing their first study visit. Poten-
tial refusals were defined as individuals who did not consent to the
screener form or who consented to the screener form but did not
complete the form.
Enrollment occurred during an initial study visit. At the end
of the study visit, enrolled participants were told they would
receive an e-mail message asking them to complete an online
HeadCount survey. Compensation for the study visit ($150)
was contingent on completion of the online HeadCount within
a week of their visit. Participants were similarly asked to complete
HeadCount questionnaires in conjunction with subsequent study
visits that occurred every 3 months.
Analysis. Data from the HeadCount surveys were analyzed to
determine the relation of CNS symptoms to heading or uninten-
tional head impacts and the direct or effect-modifying role of
neck size. Total heading, the primary independent variable, was
highly skewed and defined as an ordered categorical variable of
approximately equal size quartiles. Unintentional head impacts
were represented as a count variable (i.e., 0, 1, 21 events).
Positive CNS symptoms were defined as occurring if one or
more episodes of moderate (i.e., moderate pain or some
dizziness), severe (felt dazed, stopped play, or required medical
attention), or very severe symptoms (i.e., knocked unconscious)
were reported.
All 2-week HeadCount questionnaires were used in the anal-
ysis to assess the relation of CNS symptoms with heading and
unintentional head impacts. Repeated-measures logistic regres-
sion was used to estimate the odds ratio for the relation between
heading and unintentional head impacts to CNS symptoms as
well as the direct and effect-modifying effects of neck-related
measures. Covariates considered in the model included sex, age,
season of year (i.e., 4 quarters), intercollegiate vs club or league
play, field position, alcohol use, and cigarette use. Questionnaires
(n 5 43) were excluded if the participant did not report heading
activity or unintended head impacts during the 2-week recall
period. Seven questionnaires, all completed by one respondent,
were excluded as the heading and other data were unique and
extreme outliers. For modeling, we used the PROC MIXED
procedure in SAS/STAT 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
RESULTS A total of 535 individuals accessed the study
web portal; 22% explicitly refused and another 9.2%
did not provide data and were assumed to have refused
(figure). A total of 240 individuals completed an initial
2-week HeadCount questionnaire; 222 reported soccer
activity. Of these, 58 completed 2 HeadCounts and 80
completed 3 or more HeadCounts for a total of 524
HeadCounts. Of these, 178 questionnaires reported
heading activity and unintentional impacts, 292

 reported heading but no unintentional impacts, and 11
reported unintentional impacts but no heading.
Heading activity. Of the 222 respondents who re-
ported soccer activity in the baseline HeadCount,
68% were involved in outdoor competition, followed
by 54% for outdoor practice, 30% for indoor compe-
tition, and 18% for indoor practice (table 1). Among
those with soccer activity, the number of days of
activity and the heading per day of activity was greater
for practice than it was for competition (table 2). The
mean (median) cumulative heading across all activi-
ties among those who reported heading (n 5 197)
was 42.8 (20), where 48% of all heading occurred
during outdoor practice and where 80% of soccer
heading occurred during outdoor activities.
The mean (median) cumulative heading from the
initial HeadCount (table 2) was higher for the 84
respondents who only completed the baseline Head-
Count (i.e., mean 38.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]
24.5–51.7) compared to the 138 respondents who
completed one or more follow-up HeadCounts (i.e.,
mean 35.9, 95% CI 29.9–42.0), but these means
were not significantly different.
Unintentional head impacts. Exposure to unintentional
head impacts was reported in 35% of the 222 baseline
HeadCounts; 16% reported 2 or more episodes
(table 2). “Head hit elbow or knee” and “ball hit
the back of the head” were the 2 most common
unintentional exposures.

all reported activities on the initial HeadCount (table 3)
was 40.5 (16). Statistically significant higher levels of
heading were observed for people who do not drink
alcohol (p 5 0.02). At least one unintentional head
impact was reported in 38% of the initial 222 Head-
Counts. No significant association was found for any
of the covariates with risk of unintentional impacts.
Twenty percent of the 222 baseline HeadCounts
reported moderate to very severe symptoms, with 18

 reporting severe symptoms and 7 reporting very severe
symptoms, of which 6 had 2 or more unintentional
head impacts in a 2-week period and 1 had no unin-
tentional impacts. Among the 7 with very severe symp-
toms, 4 were in the 4th quartile and 3 were in the 3rd
quartile for heading in a 2-week period. Elevated pro-
portions
of
HeadCounts
with
symptoms
were
observed for participants whose positions were forward
(p 5 0.05) and defense (p 5 0.05), as well as partic-
ipants with similar frequency of soccer play for 6 years
or less (p 5 0.002) and those who had played 11–16
years at a similar frequency (p 5 0.004).
CNS symptoms and head impacts. The relation of CNS
symptoms with either heading or unintentional
impacts did not vary after adjusting for sex, age, prior
concussion, or other covariates described in table 3.
These covariates were not retained in the logistic
models. Moderate to very severe CNS symptoms
were related to heading activity (table 4, model 1A)
and unintentional head impacts (table 4, model 1B).
When both exposure variables were included in the
logistic model (table 4, model 1C), only heading
activity in the highest quartile was significantly related
to CNS symptoms (odds ratio [OR] 3.17, 95% CI
1.57–6.37) when compared to the lowest heading
quartile. Both 1 unintentional impact (OR 2.98,
95% CI 1.69–5.26) and 21 unintentional impacts
(OR 6.09, 95% CI 3.33–11.17) from head exposures
in a 2-week period were independently related to
CNS symptoms.
Logistic models were completed that built on model
1C (table 4) by adding the trichotomous variables for
neck length and neck circumference or separately add-
ing neck volume. None of the neck-related variables in
these models was significantly related to CNS symp-
toms and no meaningful interactions were observed
between neck measures and head impact variables.
DISCUSSION Relatively little is known about the
short-term CNS effects from exposure to repeated
head impact in soccer that may have longer-term
consequences.9,29–32
Heading

result in overt concussive events may not represent
the full span of risks. In this study, we assessed the

of
heading
and
unintentional exposures that occur in soccer to the
risk of CNS symptoms.
Heading is very common in both practice and
competition. Among those with heading activity in

 headings/2 weeks) was more than twice the median
(i.e., 20). This finding is consistent with our previous
study, where 30% of soccer players had more than
1,000 headings per year and had a higher risk of
microstructural white matter changes, typical of
TBI pathology, and worse cognitive performance.8
In this study, the 10% of 2-week questionnaires with
the most heading activity accounted for 42% of all
heading activity.
In 114 of 517 2-week questionnaire intervals,
amateur soccer players reported moderately severe
and possibly concussive CNS symptoms. This is
equivalent to a rate of 114 events/20 person-years
or almost 6 events per year of soccer play. These
events are more strongly related to unintentional head
impacts, although heading was also shown to be an
independent risk factor. These findings suggest that
soccer players experience repeated concussive and
not simply subconcussive impacts. The relation of
unintentional head impacts with moderate to severe
CNS symptoms is consistent with prior studies that
suggest soccer-related CNS symptoms are largely ex-
plained by unintentional head exposures. The risk is
substantially higher (i.e., OR of 8.36) for the
17.6% of 2-week episodes with 2 or more such expo-
sures vs the 20.2% of the 2-week episodes with a sin-
gle exposure (i.e., OR of 3.6). More specifically, if
a soccer player has one unintentional head impact,
there was a 47% probability (17.6%/[17.6% 1
20.2%]) of having another such event in the same
2-week interval. It may thus be sensible to intervene
with timely coaching when such events occur as a step
to reduce the risk of a subsequent event.
This study did not address the broader question of
whether heading or unintentional head impacts are
related to more subtle transient changes represented
by variation in performance on neuropsychological
tests. It will be important to determine if these more
subtle changes occur in the absence of severe CNS
symptoms. Since the aggregate effect of repeated im-
pacts may itself be important, independent of the
force of individual events, characterizing the number
and frequency as well as type of exposure is an impor-
tant first step toward understanding the impact of
heading and unintentional head impacts.
Previous studies have generally conflated the role
of heading with the role of unintentional impacts that
specifically result in recognized concussion.20,34–37
Prior work suggests that person-to-person collisions
are the dominant cause of concussion in high school
players.22 The latter conclusion, however, was based
on sideline observer detection, definition, and report-
ing of concussion, where overt events will stand out.
Our data suggest that concussive events due to head-
ing are less likely to be detected. Importantly, this
prior study did not measure heading exposure per

 se or test its association with concussive symptoms.
Rather, the authors’ specific focus was on recognized
concussion, not the association of collision-related
impacts with concussive symptoms. Concussive
symptoms in the absence of gross impairment or
unconsciousness may go unreported and undetected
if players are not directly questioned.
While our report contributes the largest body of
knowledge to date regarding the nature of heading
and unintentional head impacts in amateur soccer,
several limitations to this study must be considered.
Most notably, we studied relatively young adult ama-
teur players in the northeastern United States. We
cannot generalize from the level of soccer activity
among study participants to all soccer players,
including adolescents and younger children, who
may experience different patterns of exposure and also
may only engage in soccer during specific seasons of
the year. Moreover, we did not find evidence that
neck-related measures were a risk factor for or an
effect modifier of head impacts and CNS symptoms.
A prior study suggested evidence to the contrary for
female players. It is possible that neck measures are
meaningful in more vulnerable groups (e.g., younger
or less experienced players).
Our sample overall is diverse with respect to sea-
son of activity. Participants typically report playing
soccer throughout the year. We cannot generalize to
college or professional competition or to the full year
of soccer experience to estimate the proportion of
players who are at risk of CNS symptoms from differ-
ent sources of exposure.
Data on heading, unintentional head impacts, and
outcomes are self-reported and subject to recall error,
raising a question as to whether the significant associ-
ations in this study are explained by reporting bias.
For example, reverse causation (i.e., reporting more
symptoms could motivate reporting of more heading
and unintentional head impacts) could explain the
study results. For heading, however, this explanation
is unlikely as participants answered the symptom
questions after answering the heading questions and
responses could not be changed. In addition, the esti-
mate of 2-week heading exposure was the product of
a formula that included soccer practice and competi-
tion activity and separate data about heading during
these activities. Participants would have to implicitly
combine such information in a way that results in sys-
tematic CNS reporting errors. In contrast, questions
about unintentional head impacts followed responses
to questions about CNS symptoms. While reverse
causation is a possible explanation, we note that our
finding is consistent with prior evidence.
We also considered a more general bias hypothesis
where errors in reporting (i.e., either overreporting or
underreporting) CNS symptoms are assumed to be
directly correlated with frequency of exposure (i.e.,
underreporting occurs among those who report fewer
head impacts or overreporting occurs among those
who report more head impacts, or both). This assump-
tion lacks face validity when considering the likelihood
of a reporting error for severe to very severe symptoms.
Specifically, one would have to believe that the act of
reporting heading or unintentional head impacts
directly influences errors (i.e., forgetting or overreport-
ing) in reporting CNS symptoms (i.e., a soccer player
felt dazed or had to stop play or sought medical atten-
tion, or was simply knocked unconscious).
Finally, the finding of a relation from head im-
pacts in soccer to CNS symptoms is necessary but
not sufficient evidence to support a longer-term

 impact. If evidence of short-term effects was lack-
ing then it would raise questions about whether
head impacts in soccer have meaningful long-
term consequences. On the other hand, these
findings raise concerns about the likelihood of
longer-term effects and thus provide a strong
motivation for continued study.
