Abstract
Physical inactivity and sedentary behavior relate to poor health 
outcomes independently. Healthy inactive adults are a key 
target population for prevention. This systematic review and 
meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of physical 
activity and/or sedentary behavior interventions, measured 
postintervention (behavior change) and at follow-up (behavior 
change maintenance), to identify behavior change techniques 
(BCT) within, and report on fidelity. Included studies were 
randomized controlled trials, targeting healthy inactive adults, 
aiming to change physical activity and/or sedentary behavior, 
with a minimum postintervention follow-up of 6 months, using 
16 databases from 1990. Two reviewers independently coded 
risk of bias, the “Template for Intervention Description and 
Replication” (TIDieR) checklist, and BCTs. Twenty-six studies 
were included; 16 pooled for meta-analysis. Physical activity 
interventions were effective at changing behavior (d = 0.32, 
95% confidence intervals = 0.16–0.48, n = 2,346) and main-
taining behavior change after 6 months or more (d = 0.21, 
95% confidence intervals = 0.12–0.30, n = 2,190). Sedentary 
behavior interventions (n = 2) were not effective. At postint-
ervention, physical activity intervention effectiveness was 
associated with the BCTs “Biofeedback,” “Demonstration of the 
behavior,” “Behavior practice/rehearsal,” and “Graded tasks.” At 
follow-up, effectiveness was associated with using “Action plan-
ning,” “Instruction on how to perform the behavior,” “Prompts/
cues,” “Behavior practice/rehearsal,” “Graded tasks,” and 
“Self-reward.” Fidelity was only documented in one study. Good 
evidence was found for behavior change maintenance effects in 
healthy inactive adults, and underlying BCTs. This review pro-
vides translational evidence to improve research, intervention 
design, and service delivery in physical activity interventions, 
while highlighting the lack of fidelity measurement.

INTRODUCTION
Physical activity has a beneficial effect on the risk 
factors associated with cardiovascular disease, 
stroke, type 2 diabetes, and cancer [1]. When com-
pared to individuals who participate in low levels of 
physical activity, highly active and moderately active 
people have a reduced risk of all-cause mortality [2]. 
However, only 60% of adults in England, 56% in 
Australia, and 50% in the USA report participating at 
the recommended levels of 150 min/week of moder-
ate to vigorous physical activity [3–5]. Inactive adults 
(those not meeting the recommended levels), even if 
they are currently healthy, are therefore a key target 
for intervention as they may be at risk of develop-
ing ill health without long-term lifestyle change. This 
review also includes interventions aimed at reduc-
ing sedentary behavior as high levels are associated 
with a range of risk factors independently of physical 
activity levels [6].
Although previous reviews exist for physical activ-
ity interventions, they have combined inactive and 
active populations [7] or summarized highly hetero-
geneous samples (e.g., those suffering from diabetes 
and pregnant women [8]), or combined healthy 
and unhealthy adults [9]. The importance of phys-
ical activity as a primary preventative approach 
for healthy adults has long been acknowledged 
[10]. Individuals not currently engaging in physical 
Implications
Practice: Physical activity practice, gradually 
increasing intensity, using heart rate monitors, 
creating detailed plans, receiving instructions, 
using prompts, and rewarding oneself for pro-
gress may promote a change in physical activity 
behavior.
Policy: Healthy but inactive adults represent 
a key population that may be on the cusp of ill 
health and interventions in this population can be 
effective in producing sustained changes in phys-
ical activity.
Research: Future research should address the 
lack of fidelity assessment in physical activity 
interventions and the dearth of randomized con-
trolled trials aimed at reducing the sedentary be-
havior of inactive adults that assess maintenance 
of behavior change.

activity, nor presenting with ill health may not have 
experienced a “teachable moment” or any cause for 
concern for their health that would act as a catalyst 
for change [11, 12]. Consequently, despite a prolif-
eration of reviews of physical activity interventions, 
there has been no systematic review of interventions 
targeting healthy and inactive adults. The biggest 
reductions in future health problems are often seen 
when moving people from inactive to moderately 
active lifestyles [1]. Therefore, healthy adults, who 
may not yet be suffering the effects of inactivity, 
represent a key target population for public health 
prevention efforts.
Behavioral science highlights the need to draw 
an important distinction between initial behavior 
change and behavior change maintenance, which 
is reportedly harder to achieve [13]. A number of 
reviews that have attempted to analyze longer-term 
outcomes have not specified a minimum postinter-
vention follow-up period [8, 14, 15]. Therefore, the 
majority of reviewed studies, despite being 12 or 
more months in duration only captured facilitated 
behavior change (i.e., directly after active compo-
nents are completed). Maintenance is hypothesized 
to occur at a minimum of 6 months after initial be-
havior change [16]. Six-month postintervention out-
comes, where no contact with participants is made, 
are therefore needed to capture behavior change 
maintenance. This is not always clear in the litera-
ture, with reviews including studies where active 
components such as motivational newsletters or 
phone calls are still occurring during the “follow-up” 
period [8, 17, 18]. This review provides a unique 
contribution in distinguishing clearly between be-
havior change and behavior change maintenance of 
physical activity/sedentary behavior interventions.
Another crucial need is to explore the fine-grain 
detail of intervention content in an attempt to un-
cover effective elements. Specifying the active 
components of an intervention is essential for imple-
menting, replicating, and synthesizing successful 
approaches [19]. The Behavior Change Technique 
(BCT) taxonomy v1 [19] includes 93 items that 
allow the “active ingredients” of interventions to be 
systematically described, reviewed, and replicated. 
Previous reviews have either failed to identify be-
havior change techniques [20] or have analyzed 
BCTs using older less comprehensive taxonomies 
[18, 21]. In previous taxonomies such as the 40-item 
CALO-RE taxonomy [22] a number of BCTs were 
missing and many more were not irreducible (i.e., 
these BCTs were composites and needed to be fur-
ther broken down into more basic elements) [23]; 
as such, using this taxonomy is less likely to provide 
interventionalists with sufficient information for 
clear replication. This review is the first in the area 
of physical activity and sedentary behavior interven-
tions that aims to investigate behavior change and 
maintenance using the 93 item BCT taxonomy v1 
[19] in healthy inactive adults.
Finally, to enable replication, intervention design-
ers would benefit from the knowledge of factors such 
as mode of delivery, duration, frequency, and fidelity 
(an evaluation of the delivery of the intervention as 
planned). However, this detail is rarely reported. 
The “Template for Intervention Description and 
Replication” (TIDieR) [24] allows for a systematic 
description of interventions using a 12-item check-
list detailing the why, what, who, where, and how of 
intervention delivery. The current review will pro-
vide this additional insight, essential for intervention 
replication. In summary, this review aimed to fill a 
number of important evidence gaps. This is the first 
review to synthesize randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs) of physical activity and sedentary behavior 
interventions for healthy inactive adults. It is also the 
first review to analyze outcomes in this population 
representing both behavior change (postinterven-
tion) and behavior change maintenance (follow-up). 
Finally, it is the first review to provide evidence from 
these interventions using the BCT taxonomy v1 and 
analyze the content from items on the TIDieR check-
list. We aimed to answer three research questions:
•Are RCTs of interventions aimed at increasing phys-
ical activity or reducing sedentary behavior in 
healthy inactive adults effective immediately postint-
ervention (behavior change) and at a minimum of 
6-month postintervention follow-up (behavior change 
maintenance)?
•Which behavior change techniques, are associated with 
effectiveness at postintervention and follow-up?
•How often is the fidelity of such interventions checked?
METHODS
The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (regis-
tration number: CRD42014014321), and a detailed 
preregistered protocol was also published [25].
Eligibility criteria
Study characteristics
Participants
Healthy adults (aged 18 or older) who were inactive 
(defined as less than 150 min of moderate or 75 min 
of vigorous-intensity activity per week, or less than 
10,000 steps/day). Included studies had a min-
imum of 70% of participants classified as inactive. 
Healthy was defined as those without serious injury, 
long-term physical incapacity, or suffering or reha-
bilitating from chronic conditions and risk factors 
that require medication.
Intervention
Any intervention evaluated in an RCT with a pri-
mary aim (as stated in the full paper and/or study 
protocol) to increase physical activity and/or reduce 
sedentary behavior. We included all settings (e.g., 
leisure centre, primary care) and delivery formats 
(e.g., group, individual).

page 149 of 157
Comparator or control
Any passive (e.g., usual care) or active (e.g., alterna-
tive behavioral approaches) control group.
Outcomes
Primary outcomes were self-reported or objectively 
measured physical activity and/or sedentary be-
havior assessed at baseline and/or postintervention 
(defined as directly after intervention completion), 
and a minimum of 6 months after intervention com-
pletion. Secondary outcomes, where available, were 
recorded.
Information sources
Searches were conducted on the following elec-
tronic databases from January 1, 1990 to August 
2016: Applied Social Sciences Index (ASSIA); British 
Nursing Index (BNI); Cumulative Index to Nursing 
and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); 
Cochrane systematic review database; current 
controlled trials register; Database of Abstracts 
of Reviews of Effects (DARE); EMBASE; Health 
Technology Assessment (HTA) database; National 
Institute of Health Research (NIHR) portfolio; 
PsycINFO; PubMed; Scopus; SPORTDiscus; System 
for Information on Grey Literature (SIGLE); Web of 
Science. In addition, 18 published systematic reviews 
[8, 14, 15, 17, 20, 26–38] were screened to make sure 
relevant articles were not missed by the electronic 
searches. Furthermore, we screened the reference lists 
of all included studies and requested from experts 
(e.g., members of European Health Psychology 
Society) in the field any relevant information on pub-
lished, unpublished, and ongoing research. 
Search strategy
Searches included a combination of terms from 
medical subject headings (MeSH) and keywords in 
the title, abstract, and text (Supplementary Table 1). 
The search included multiple terms for population 
(e.g., adult, inactive), intervention (e.g., health pro-
motion, physical activity), comparator (e.g., clinical 
trial), and outcome themes (e.g., exercise, sedentary 
behavior). All terms within each theme were com-
bined with “OR” and then the four themes were 
combined with “AND.”
Study selection
Search results were imported into Endnote X7 
reference management software and duplicates 
were removed. Titles and abstracts were screened 
by N.H. with a random 10% done independently 
(N.T.). Full texts of potentially relevant studies were 
assessed independently by two reviewers (N.H., 
N.T.). Where information was missing or only pro-
tocols were available, study authors were contacted 
for relevant information regarding eligibility crite-
ria. Any disagreements were resolved through dis-
cussions with the other reviewers (A.C., D.T.).
Data extraction
All data from included studies were extracted into 
Excel using a prepiloted data extraction form. Data 
from each included paper were extracted independ-
ently by two reviewers (N.H., N.T.) and included 
the variables listed in Table 1. We contacted 10 
authors requesting additional outcome data for the 
meta-analysis and obtained further information 
from two.
Classification of intervention and control condition content
Behavior change techniques were coded as present 
or absent using the BCT taxonomy v1 for all interven-
tion and active control conditions. Two experienced 
reviewers (A.C., N.H.) coded all available primary 
papers, related papers, and protocols for each study 
independently (as per [23]). The TIDieR checklist

describes reporting items that are essential for accur-
ate intervention description and replication. The 12 
items on the checklist were coded independently by 
two reviewers (N.H., N.T.) as either present, absent, 
unclear, or not applicable. Items 11 and 12 were of 
particular interest as they cover planned and actual 
adherence/fidelity assessment respectively. Inter-
rater reliability throughout this review was assessed 
using Krippendorf’s α, a reliability coefficient that 
compares favorably to  
alternatives [39].
Risk of bias
Two reviewers (N.H., D.T.) independently assessed 
risk of bias using the Cochrane tool for assessing risk 
of bias [40] in RevMan software. Assessment was per-
formed for the domains of allocation sequence gen-
eration and concealment, blinding of participants, 
personnel and outcome assessors, completeness of 
outcome data (postintervention and follow-up), se-
lective reporting of outcomes (if protocol available), 
and any other potential sources of bias. We assessed 
risk of bias as either low, unclear, or high risk.
Quality of the evidence
The quality of evidence for primary outcomes was 
assessed using the Grading of Recommendations 
Assessment, Development and Evaluation guide-
lines (GRADE) [41]. Assessment was performed in 
the areas of design, study limitations, consistency, 
directness, precision, and publication bias. Risk 
of publication bias was assessed with funnel plots 
using Stata 14. Grading was assessed for continuous 
physical activity and sedentary behavior outcomes 
at postintervention and follow-up. Quality of the 
included studies was judged as high, moderate, low, 
or very low depending on our confidence that the 
estimates of the effect were accurate based on the 
GRADE guidelines [41, 42]. RCTs start as high 
quality but can be downgraded for serious problems 
on any of the five domains.
Statistical analysis
Effect sizes
As per Cochrane guidelines for the meta-analysis, 
it was assumed that baseline figures were equal 
between groups based on the RCT design [43]. 
Postintervention and follow-up means, standard 
deviations, and sample sizes for each condition were 
analyzed to produce standardized mean differences 
(Cohen’s d), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
This analysis was performed for the studies report-
ing continuous outcomes (16 out of 26) [44–59].
Synthesis of results
We conducted two meta-analyses using a random 
effects model in Stata 14 to calculate pooled effect 
sizes for postintervention and follow-up physical 
activity outcomes. Heterogeneity was investigated 
using Higgins I
2, with heightened levels (over 
50%—moderate; over 75%—high) being explored fur-
ther in subgroup or sensitivity analysis.
Subgroup, sensitivity, and additional analysis
Preplanned analysis by subgroups was conducted 
by type of physical activity measure (self-report 
vs. objective) and targeting single versus multiple 
behaviors. Sensitivity analysis was completed on 
the follow-up meta-analysis with and without a 
study, which produced an effect size different in 
magnitude from the others. Prespecified additional 
analysis was conducted using a set of univariate 
meta-regression models to examine the association 
between 20 individual behavior change techniques 
(behavior change techniques had to be present in 
at least two studies for inclusion), total number of 
behavior change techniques, intervention duration, 
follow-up duration, age, and intervention effective-
ness. Prespecified additional analyses of sedentary 
behavior outcomes, mode of delivery, and theoret-
ical basis were not possible due to the small number 
of studies (sedentary behavior: n = 2) and wide 
range of approaches across studies respectively. The 
association between behavior change techniques 
and effect size was investigated using regression 
coefficients (β), with values > .10 in conjunction 
with an adjusted R
2 of >10%, indicating an important 
association [26]. Due to the large number of univar-
iate meta-regressions, there was a risk of false-posi-
tive findings. Therefore, we used the Monte Carlo 
permutation test (10,000 permutations) to calculate 
adjusted p values [60].
RESULTS
Study selection
The final review included 26 studies [44–59, 61–70] 
published across 47 papers (Fig. 1).
Study and participant characteristics
The country in which the 26 studies were con-
ducted was diverse with the largest number from 
America (11 studies [46–50, 53–55, 58, 61, 62]; 
Supplementary Table 2). The behavior targeted 
was physical activity in 20 studies [45–55, 57–59, 
64–69], physical activity and sedentary behavior 
in two studies [44, 56], physical activity and diet in 
three studies [61–63], and physical activity, diet, and 
smoking in one study [70]. Intervention provider 
was mixed with the most common involving an in-
structor [50, 51, 56, 57] or student counselor [45, 
49, 52, 67]. Intervention setting was most frequently 
primary care [64–67, 70], an exercise facility/leisure 
center [18, 50, 51, 56, 57], or delivered by post [47, 
53, 54, 68, 69]. Duration and frequency ranged 
from receiving a single information pack [69] to 33 
individual and group sessions over 14 months [60]. 
Theoretical basis was highly variable with the trans-
theoretical model utilized most often [50, 52, 64–66, 
68–70].

Participants were on average 51.4 years old and 
mostly female (77%) with an average body mass 
index of 29.2 and 28.9 kg/m
2 in intervention and 
control conditions, respectively. Participants in 
16/19 studies reporting body mass index were over-
weight. Average sample size was 129 participants 
for the intervention conditions (3,350 total) and 143 
for the control conditions (3,713 total) at baseline. 
Only 12 studies reported ethnicity, with nine having 
a majority of white/Caucasian participants [47, 48, 
50, 52–54, 61, 65, 67]. Average intervention length 
was 21 weeks (range 0–61) and the average length 
between the intervention finishing and the last fol-
low-up measurement was 41 weeks (range 24–121). 
The attrition rate from baseline to follow-up was 28% 
in the intervention and 26% in the control condi-
tions. For primary outcomes, 21 studies used a sub-
jective measure [44, 47–49, 51–55, 58, 61–70], three 
used a mixture of subjective and objective measures 
[50, 57, 59], and two an objective measure only [45, 
46]. Both sedentary behavior measures were self-re-
port [44, 56].
For secondary outcomes, one study found 
improvements in physical fitness (postintervention 
and follow-up [63]), one found postintervention 
increases in self-efficacy [53], one found an interven-
tion effect at follow-up for physical functioning and 
mental health [66], and one found an improvement 
for women only on three subscales of quality of 
Life (QOL), but a decrease on four other subscales, 
all at follow-up [64]. Only seven studies reported 
adverse effects, with three showing some imbal-
ance between groups (two showed increased risk 
of injury/falls in the intervention condition [53, 67] 
and one showed more adverse events for controls) 
[46].
Behavior change techniques
The 26 interventions contained an average of 8.4 
behavior change techniques, with a range between 
0 and 17 and a total of 37 different behavior change 
techniques implemented across the interventions 
(Supplementary Table 3). The most frequently 
used behavior change techniques were “Goal set-
ting (behavior)” (22 studies) and “Social support 
(unspecified)” (20 studies). The 19 active control 
conditions contained an average of 5.1 behavior 
change techniques, with a range between 0 and 
15 and a total of 24 behavior change techniques 
implemented across the control conditions. The 
most frequent behavior change techniques in the 
active control conditions were “Goal setting (behav-
ior)” and “Information about health consequences” 
(both 10 studies). Average inter-rater reliability for

than one study was good (Krippendorf’s α = 0.91, 
range = 0.58–1.00).
TIDieR checklist
Reporting in the 26 intervention conditions was ad-
equate for 69% of items (Supplementary Table 4). 
For the 19 active control conditions, reporting was 
adequate for 54% of items. For intervention and con-
trol conditions, a brief description (item 1%–92% 
for intervention; 89% for control), mode of delivery 
(item 6%–100% for intervention; 79% for control), 
and procedure (item 4%–88% for intervention; 84% 
for control) were the most well reported. Where the 
intervention was delivered (item 7%–47% for inter-
vention; 50% for control) and how and by whom fi-
delity or adherence was assessed (item 11%–36% for 
intervention; 19% for control) were the items with 
the most inadequate reporting in both conditions. 
Average inter-rater reliability for the TIDieR items 
was good (Krippendorf’s α = 0.75).
Risk of bias within studies
Nineteen studies were judged to be at high risk 
of bias on at least one domain (Supplementary 
Figure 1). The domain judged as having the lowest 
risk of bias was completeness of outcome reporting 
(low risk in 15/26 studies for follow-up outcomes 
and 12/21 studies for postintervention outcomes). 
Random sequence allocation was reported ad-
equately in 12 studies. For the remaining indicators, 
the number of studies assessed as low risk was poor. 
The risk of bias domains that were judged to have 
a large number of high-risk studies were selective 
reporting (11 studies) and “other” (10 studies). The 
majority of the judgments in the “other” domain 
were caused by low sample sizes and/or high attri-
tion rates at follow-up. Overall, the risk of bias rating 
across all domains was mostly unclear (60%). Good 
inter-rater agreement was achieved across the eight 
main domains (Krippendorf’s α = 0.81).
Intervention effects on main outcomes
Physical activity
Five studies had more than one intervention group. 
In each instance, the most intensive intervention 
group was compared with controls. Five studies 
reported baseline and follow-up outcomes only. Of 
the 21 studies that reported physical activity out-
comes postintervention, 13 studies showed a sig-
nificant effect in favor of the intervention, 2 studies 
showed a significant effect in favor of the interven-
tion on a subscale of the main outcome, and the 
remaining 6 studies showed no effect. At follow-up, 
11 studies showed a significant effect in favor of the 
intervention, 2 studies showing a significant effect in 
favor of the intervention on subscales of the main 
outcome, and 13 studies showed no effect.
Three studies provided sufficient noncontinuous 
data (percentage of participants classified as active). 
Only one of these studies showed a difference in 
favor of the intervention at follow-up. Fourteen 
studies provided sufficient continuous data (e.g., 
minutes per week/day of walking or moderate/
vigorous activity) to pool for the postintervention 
meta-analysis and 16 for the follow-up meta-anal-
ysis. Postintervention, intervention participants 
engaged in significantly more physical activity than 
control participants (d = 0.32 [95% CI = 0.16–0.48]; 
Supplementary Figure 2), representing a relatively 
small effect, with a moderate to high level of het-
erogeneity (I
2 = 69%). The effective interventions 
showed postintervention improvements ranging 
from 31 to 247 min/week of physical activity and 
606–1,849 steps/day.
At follow-up, intervention participants still engaged 
in significantly more physical activity but the effect 
was smaller (d = 0.21 [0.12–0.30]; Supplementary 
Figure 3), with very low heterogeneity (I
2 = 3%). The 
effective interventions showed improvements at fol-
low-up ranging from 5 to 95 min/week of physical 
activity and 421–1,370 steps/day.
Sedentary behavior
Of the two studies that reported sedentary behavior 
outcomes (both sitting time), only one reported 
group differences, showing no intervention effect at 
postintervention or follow-up.
Quality of evidence across studies
Using the GRADE criteria [41, 42], the postinter-
vention physical activity outcome was downgraded 
two levels to low quality because there was a high 
level of heterogeneity (serious inconsistency) and 
suspicion of publication bias based on the funnel 
plot (Table 2).
The follow-up physical activity outcome was 
judged to be high-quality evidence, with no obvious 
problems across the five domains. The postinterven-
tion and follow-up sedentary behavior outcomes 
were both downgraded one level to moderate 
quality based on the fact that one of the two studies 
showed high risk of bias (serious inconsistency).
Subgroup and sensitivity analysis
One study showed an effect size that was mark-
edly different from the other studies at follow-up. 
Removing this study did not have any impact on the 
pooled effect or heterogeneity levels.
Studies using self-report measures had a signifi-
cant, small-to-medium effect size postintervention 
(d = 0.39 [95% CI = 0.19–0.59]; I
2 = 72%), whereas 
studies using objective measures showed a small, 
nonsignificant effect size (d = 0.14 [−0.01 to 0.30]; 
I
2 = 0%). Studies using self-report measures also 
had a small but significant effect size at follow-up 
(d = 0.23 [0.12–0.35]; I
2 = 24%), whereas studies 
using objective measures had a small nonsignificant 
effect size (d = 0.16 [−0.02 to 0.33]; I
2 = 0%).

Studies targeting only physical activity had a small 
significant effect size postintervention (d = 0.29 
[0.15–0.43]; I
2 = 52%), whereas studies targeting 
multiple behaviors had a small-to-medium, but 
nonsignificant effect size (d = 0.43 [−0.26 to 1.12]; 
I
2 = 93%). Studies targeting only physical activity 
showed a small significant effect size at follow-up 
(d = 0.22 [0.11–0.32]; I
2 = 10%), whereas studies tar-
geting multiple behaviors showed a small nonsignif-
icant effect size (d = 0.19 [−0.00 to 0.39]; I
2 = 0%).
Meta-regression
All covariates (intervention duration, follow-up 
duration, number of behavior change techniques, 
age of participants, 20 individual behavior change 
techniques) were entered into univariate models 
to calculate the percentage of among-study het-
erogeneity (adjusted R
2) explained by the covar-
iate and the strength of the association between 
the covariate and effectiveness (β; Supplementary 
Table 5). Studies that included the behavior change 
techniques 
“Biofeedback,” 
“Demonstration 
of 
the behavior,” “Behavior practice/rehearsal,” and 
“Graded tasks” showed larger effect sizes at postint-
ervention than studies that did not. The large R
2 for 
the BCT “Biofeedback” was due to the 95% CIs from 
each subgroup (present vs. absent) not overlapping. 
Studies that included the behavior change tech-
niques “Problem solving,” “Review behavior goal,” 
and “Feedback on behavior” showed a smaller effect 
size at postintervention than studies that did not.
At follow-up, there was minimal heterogeneity 
(3%). Therefore, subgroup analyses were utilized 
with a criterion of a difference in Cohen’s d of 
>0.10 defined as meaningful, consistent with the 
meta-regression (Supplementary Table 6). Studies 
that included “Action planning,” “Instruction on 
how to perform the behavior,” “Prompts/cues,” 
“Behavior practice/rehearsal,” “Graded tasks,” and 
“Self-reward” showed larger effect sizes at follow-up 
than studies that did not. Studies that included 
“Information about antecedents” had a smaller 
effect size at follow-up than studies that did not.
DISCUSSION
This review showed that interventions aiming to 
increase physical activity in healthy inactive adults 
are effective in promoting behavior change and 
behavior change maintenance. The two eligible 
interventions measuring sedentary behavior were 
not effective at either. The quality of the evidence 
was high for follow-up physical activity outcomes, 
moderate for both sedentary behavior outcomes, 
and low for postintervention physical activity out-
comes. The majority of risk of bias ratings was 
judged as unclear, reflecting a problem with poor 
reporting of details essential for judgments of 
study quality. Problems with inadequate reporting 
extended to the TIDieR coding, with reporting of 
active control conditions a serious problem for rep-
lication. Items 11 and 12 of the TIDieR guidelines 
combine adherence and fidelity, and therefore even 
for studies that did contain this information, it was 
focused on attendance and engagement, and not on 
the delivery of content as planned. In fact, only one 
study assessed the fidelity of intervention content. 
This is of real concern for future research, as without 
the knowledge or measurement of fidelity, details of 
the effectiveness of interventions must be taken with 
caution, as it could be the case that the intervention 
was not delivered as planned. The behavior change 
technique coding provided a detailed summary of 
intervention components and showed the potential 
for a number of techniques to be associated with 
intervention effectiveness.
Using subgroup analysis, the studies classified as 
using objective measurements all utilized pedome-
ters and overall were found to be ineffective. This 
may be due to overestimation in self-report meas-
ures [71], pedometers not accurately distinguishing 
between intensities of activity or capturing activities 
such as cycling [72], or reliability issues when com-
pared with accelerometers [73]. Lastly, only one of 
the four studies stated that pedometers were sealed. 
Pedometers could therefore have been used for the 
unintended purpose of self-monitoring behavior, 
particularly in one study where self-monitoring 
was not a stated part of the intervention or control 
group. It is unfortunately beyond the scope of this 
review to analyze why this difference has occurred.
Comparison with other studies
This is the first review to analyze only studies with 
a minimum of 6-month postintervention follow-up. 
Exploring maintenance of behavior change after a 
significant period of time in which no intervention 
contact has been made with participants is essential 
to investigate whether positive behavioral changes 
can be sustained [74]. Previous reviews of physical 
activity interventions have found similar effect sizes 
for postintervention physical activity outcomes [1, 
15, 26]. Two previous reviews of long-term effect-
iveness in physical activity outcomes have not truly 
captured follow-up outcomes because the majority 
of the studies only measured outcomes until the end 
of an active intervention period [14, 15]. The same 
issue was found in one previous review, which high-
lighted long-term outcomes for sedentary behavior 
in 16 studies [8].
This review was also consistent with previous 
ones in finding that combined physical activity and 
sedentary behavior interventions are ineffective in 
changing sitting time [8, 27]. Both previous reviews 
found only four very small RCTs of sedentary 
behavior interventions, none of which collected 
any follow-up outcomes [8, 27]. Unsurprisingly, 
the present review found no interventions target-
ing only sedentary behavior from 26 years of lit-
erature that fit our criteria. This highlights a need

for more interventions to assess the maintenance of 
changes in sedentary behavior and to include meas-
ures other than sitting time. The BCT analysis was 
consistent with a previous review of interventions 
targeting obese adults (using an older taxonomy), 
which showed that demonstrating the behavior, 
using prompts and cues, prompting behavioral prac-
tice, setting graded tasks, and rewarding progress 
were associated with effectiveness [28]. This review 
did not however find that interventions containing 
self-monitoring were more effective, contrasting it 
with previous reviews using much more heteroge-
neous samples [8, 26].
Implications for research and practice
Despite physical activity interventions, showing 
statistically significant effectiveness at both time 
points, the effect sizes could not be translated into 
meaningful units to judge potential clinical signifi-
cance. This reflects a common pattern from other 
reviews of physical activity interventions (e.g., [26, 
34]) that cannot quantify overall improvements for 
practitioners and policy makers in a more useable 
manner (e.g., minutes per day of moderate physical 
activity) because physical activity is measured in 
such diverse ways. This problem has led to a recent 
call for the measurement of physical activity to be 
more standardized so that data can be pooled more 
meaningfully to further knowledge [75]. However, 
two previous reviews showed that effect sizes of 
d = 0.19 and d = 0.18 equated to increases of 15 and 
73 min of physical activity per week and 496 and 
620 steps/day, respectively, dependent on baseline 
activity levels [7, 76]. Given that the interventions 
in this review were in people with low levels of base-
line activity and effect sizes were somewhat larger, 
the increases may have been greater, particularly at 
postintervention.
Previous research has shown that for overweight 
adults, experiencing health events or “teachable 
moments,” such as a doctor recommendation about 
health can be the catalyst for long-term changes in 
diet and physical activity [11]. The interventions 
highlighted in this review were for healthy inactive 
adults, who were overall in the overweight category 
across the included studies. This represents an ideal 
population to intervene with, by for instance, an 
intervention delivered through primary care, to 
lessen the risk of developing serious health condi-
tions. This review aids commissioners, practitioners, 
officers, and policy makers in the design of future 
physical activity interventions for this population 
by showing that the inclusion of heart rate monitors 
to track exertion during exercise, providing a dem-
onstration of the behavior, prompting practice of 
the behavior (often in supervised exercise classes), 
and increasing the intensity and duration of exer-
cise in progressive stages, may be effective in pro-
ducing changes in physical activity—the last two 
may also produce changes that can be maintained 
over longer periods. In addition, including detailed 
plans to perform the behavior, providing instruc-
tion on how to perform the behavior, encouraging 
the use of prompts/cues as a reminder to exercise, 
and rewarding oneself for making efforts to increase 
physical activity may lead to sustained improve-
ments in physical activity.
Strengths and limitations
This review is the first to investigate physical ac-
tivity interventions specifically with healthy inactive 
adults, to draw a distinction between outcomes of 
behavior change and behavior change maintenance, 
and to use the latest taxonomy to analyze BCTs in 
relation to these two outcomes. The strengths of 
this review include the comprehensive terms and 
databases searched, the RCT design of the studies 
included, the quality assessment using GRADE, and 
the preregistration and published protocol. In add-
ition, this is the first review to incorporate coding 
of TIDieR guidelines against published physical ac-
tivity intervention descriptions, which highlighted 
key characteristics such as dose and frequency of 
intervention contacts. This fine-grained detail is im-
portant in contributing to ongoing efforts such as the 
Human Behavior Change Project that aim to build 
an ontology of behavior change which will allow 
intervention designers to answer what works, with 
what behaviors, for who, and why [77].
Due to the limitations of reviewing BCTs precho-
sen by other researchers, or perhaps not reported 
within manuscripts, this review could not comment 
on the remaining items from the BCT taxonomy v1. 
Also, given the small number of studies included in 
the meta-regression, this analysis had limited power 
and more studies would be needed to provide 
stronger evidence for the true effects of individual 
BCTs, particularly the large postintervention effect 
found for “Biofeedback.” Also, although every effort 
was made to include only healthy inactive adults, 
some of the studies only provided basic baseline 
data on which to make this decision. Furthermore, 
only English language studies were included and, 
for resource reasons only 10% of the initial titles and 
abstracts were double screened.
CONCLUSIONS
The population highlighted in this review overall 
were inactive, overweight, and not reported to have 
any serious health conditions. This population is 
key in targeting individuals that may be at the tip-
ping point of developing chronic health problems 
without sustained behavior change. Physical activ-
ity interventions are effective in changing physical 
activity and maintaining these changes, with the evi-
dence for maintenance effects being of greater qual-
ity. There is no evidence to date that longer-term 
changes in sedentary behavior can be achieved by 
intervening with this population.

Overall reporting of behavioral interventions is 
in need of improvement. Adoption of the TIDieR 
guidelines, particularly details of fidelity assessment, 
and structuring the description of content using the 
BCT taxonomy v1 would vastly improve the abil-
ity of researchers, practitioners, and policy makers 
to interpret and replicate effective interventions. 
Standardization of physical activity measurement 
would also be hugely beneficial for the translation of 
evidence synthesis into practical recommendations 
for practitioners and policy makers. This review pro-
vides those working across the spectrum of physical 
activity promotion with key information on how to 
commission, design, and implement physical activ-
ity interventions for adults who are at heightened 
risk of ill health due to inactivity.
