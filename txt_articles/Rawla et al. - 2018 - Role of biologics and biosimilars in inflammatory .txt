Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory disease 
of the gastrointestinal system. The spectrum is of predominantly two types, namely, ulcerative 
colitis and Crohn’s disease. The incidence of IBD has been increasing steadily since 1990, and 
so the number of agents used in their treatment. Biologics that are derived partly or completely 
from living biological sources such as animals and humans have become widely available, 
which provide therapeutic benefits to the IBD patients. Currently, monoclonal antibodies against 
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, and golimumab), integrins 
(vedolizumab and natalizumab), and interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 antagonists (ustekinumab) 
are approved for use in IBD. Biosimilars of infliximab and adalimumab are also available for 
the treatment of IBD. This review summarizes the clinical pharmacology, studies leading to 
their approval, overall indications and their use in IBD, usage in pregnancy and lactation, and 
the adverse effects of these agents. This review also summarizes the recent advances and future 
perspectives specific to biologics and biosimilars in IBD.

Introduction
The inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises two types, namely, the ulcerative 
colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). They are a spectrum of chronic idiopathic 
autoimmune inflammatory disorders with remission and relapses, primarily affecting 
the gastrointestinal system.1 It was traditionally regarded as the disease of the west-
ernized nations, but in the 21st century, the epidemiology of IBD is fast changing.2 
A systematic review reports that the highest prevalence of IBD is seen in Europe 
(UC 505 per 1,00,000 in Norway and CD 322 per 1,00,000 in Germany) and North 
America (UC 286 per 1,00,000 in the USA and CD 319 per 1,00,000 in Canada).3 
It also reports that the incidence has been rising since 1990 in newly industrialized 
countries of Africa, Asia, and South America. For example, the annual percentage 
change of UC and CD in Brazil was +14.9% (95% CI 10.4, 19.6) and +11.1% (95% 
CI 4.8, 17.8), respectively, whereas in Taiwan, it was +4.0% (95% CI 1.0, 7.1) and 
+4.8% (95% CI 1.8, 8.0), respectively.3 UC is characterized by confluent mucosal 
inflammation and erosions starting from the anal verge and extending to a variable 
extent.4 CD is a transmural inflammation of any part of the gastrointestinal tract with

characteristic rectal sparing and skip lesions often associated 
with extraintestinal manifestations involving the joint, skin, 
or eyes.5 Patients often complain of diarrhea associated with 
rectal bleeding, abdominal tenderness, and weight loss.6,7
Etiopathogenesis of IBD comprises genetic compo-
nents, environmental factors, microbial flora of the gut, and 
immune responses.8 However, the main mechanism seems 
to be the bacterial antigens gaining access to the antigen-
presenting cells through the impaired epithelial barrier. 
There are interleukin (IL)-12- and IL-18-mediated type 1 
helper T-cell responses in CD and IL-4-mediated type 2 
helper T-cell responses in UC.9 The balance between pro- 
and anti-inflammatory responses is governed by regulatory 
TH17 and Treq cells as both of them serve to limit immune 
and inflammatory responses in the gut.9 The T cells further 
govern the release of IFN and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 
that recruit macrophages, which in turn positively regulate 
T helper cells.9 Finally, the recruited inflammatory cells gain 
access to the site of inflammation with the help of cell adhe-
sion molecules such as integrins.9
Medical therapy of IBD is complex as the disease etiology 
is multifactorial and the primary aim of pharmacotherapy is 
to dampen the generalized inflammatory response, thereby 
relieving symptoms.10 Off late importance has been given to 
mucosal healing as well.10 The specific goals of treatment in 
IBD include the control of acute exacerbation, maintenance 
of relapses, treatment of specific complications, and sur-
veillance of malignant transformation.11 Traditionally, the 
drugs used in the treatment of IBD are mesalamine deriva-
tives (mesalamine, sulfasalazine, olsalazine, and balsala-
zide), glucocorticoids (prednisolone, methylprednisolone, 
hydrocortisone, and budesonide), and immunomodulators 
(6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclosporine, 
and tacrolimus).10 With the advent of advances in medical 
science and technology, a new group of drugs emerged 
for various chronic disease conditions called the biologics 
that are derived partly or completely from living biological 
sources such as animals and humans.12 The most widely used 
biologics are the TNF-α inhibitors such as adalimumab, 
certolizumab, golimumab, and infliximab, which are highly 
effective in the treatment of both UC and CD. The other bio-
logic agents in IBD include the integrin receptor antagonists, 
namely, vedolizumab and natalizumab, and IL-12 and IL-23 
antagonist, ustekinumab.13 This review summarizes the clini-
cal pharmacology, overall indications and their use in IBD, 
usage in pregnancy and lactation, and the adverse effects of 
these agents and their biosimilars.
We have summarized various approved agents for cur-
rent use in IBD and their recommended dosage regimen in 
Table 1. Some of the biologics in the Phases II and III of their 
development along with their mechanism of action as regis-
tered in the global clinical trial registry (www.clinicaltrials.
gov) for use in IBD are summarized in Table 2. Similarly, the 
biosimilars in the pipeline at various stages of development 
for use in IBD and their status in various countries of the 
world are summarized in Table 3.

Review methodology
Studies were searched in electronic databases according to 
article titles, abstract contents, and relevance in the field 
of biologics and biosimilars in IBD. The database used in 
this review included PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Google 
Scholar, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency, and 
Cochrane databases. We also manually searched references 
to identify additional relevant studies. The “Keywords” above 
were used to locate relevant journal articles. Here, we pro-
vide a comprehensive narrative literature review of the role 
of biologics and biosimilars in IBD as well as discuss and 
highlight the clinical pharmacology, overall indications and 
their use in IBD, usage in pregnancy and lactation, and the 
adverse effects of these agents and their biosimilars.

arthritis (RA).14 It was initially named as D2E7 marketed by 
Abbott Laboratories (Chicago, IL, USA) and currently owned 
by AbbVie (Chicago, IL, USA).15 The name Humira stands 
for human MAb in RA. It is a recombinant human immu-
noglobulin (Ig)-G1 MAb created using the phage display 
technology.16 It inhibits TNF-α, which is a cytokine involved 
in normal inflammatory and immunological responses, 
and it inhibits its interaction with p55 and p75 cell surface 
TNF-alpha receptors. It does not have action on TNF-beta.16 
It also causes changes in the levels of adhesion molecules 
that are responsible for leukocyte migration. Adalimumab is 
indicated for use in moderate-to-severe RA, juvenile idio-
pathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, 
moderate-to-severe CD and UC with inadequate response 
to conventional therapy, moderate-to-severe chronic plaque 
psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, uveitis, and Behcet’s dis-
ease.17 It is available as a sterile, preservative-free solution in 
the pen of 80 and 40 mg, the prefilled syringes of 80, 40, 20, 
and 10 mg, and a single use institutional vial of 40 mg, which 
are to be given subcutaneously (SC).14 The bioavailability of 
the agent is 64% with a half-life of ~2 weeks following linear 
kinetics of elimination.14
Dosing in CD
The recommended dose regimen for use in CD in adults is 
160 mg on day 1, 80 mg on day 15, and a maintenance dose of 
40 mg every alternate week starting at day 29 for not >1 year.14 
The evidence for the use of adalimumab in CD stems from 
three main clinical trials, namely, CLASSIC (clinical assess-
ment of adalimumab safety and efficacy studied as induction 
therapy in CD), CHARM (Crohn’s trial of the fully human 
antibody adalimumab for remission maintenance), and GAIN 
(gauging adalimumab efficacy in infliximab nonresponders).18 
The CLASSIC-I trial is a dose-ranging randomized controlled 
trial (RCT) with 299 moderate-to-severe CD patients naive 
to TNF-α inhibitor therapy who were randomized to receive 
adalimumab (40/20, 80/40, or 160/80 mg) or placebo at weeks 
0 and 2. The remission rates (primary endpoint) defined as CD 
activity index (CDAI) <150 at week 4 were 18% (P=0.36), 
24% (P=0.06), and 36% (P=0.001), respectively, and 12% in 
the placebo group.19 A total of 275 patients from CLASSIC-
I entered the CLASSIC-II RCT where all patients received 
40 mg adalimumab at weeks 4 and 6 of CLASSIC-I. A total 
of 55 patients who were at remission during both the dos-
ing of CLASSIC-II were re-randomized into adalimumab 
40 mg every other week (EOW), weekly, or placebo through 
56 weeks. The rates of remission were 79%, 83%, and 44%, 
respectively. The remaining 204 patients who were not on 
remission while entering CLASSIC-II were subjected to adali-
mumab 40 mg EOW open label with the option to increase 
the dose to 40 mg weekly in case of a nonresponse or flare, 
and at 56 weeks, 46% were at remission.20 In CHARM trial, 
~40% of the 499 patients with moderate-to-severe CD had 
clinical remission at 26 and 52 weeks suggesting long-term 
efficacy.21 In case of the GAIN trial conducted among patients 
who had either lost response or were intolerant to infliximab, 
patients were randomized to receive either adalimumab 
induction therapy or placebo and 21% achieved remission 
while approximately half demonstrated clinical benefit.22 A 
study done by Cote-Daigneault et al has shown the evidence 
for efficacy in fistulizing CD and in achieving mucosal heal-
ing in CD unlike certolizumab and in UC.23 Adalimumab is 
indicated in pediatric CD. IMAgINE 1 and IMAgINE 2 are 
the two trials showing the evidence of efficacy and safety of 
adalimumab in pediatric population. The IMAgINE 1 trial 
was conducted in 192 children with CD not responding to 
conventional therapy. After an open-label induction therapy 
with SC adalimumab at weeks 0 and 2, 188 children at week 4 
were randomized to receive double-blind maintenance therapy 
with either high dose (40 or 20 mg for body weight ≥40 or 
<40 kg; n=93) or low dose (20 or 10 mg for body weight ≥40 
or <40 kg; n=95) of adalimumab alternate week for 48 weeks. 
At week 26, 63 (33.5%) of the 152 patients who completed 
26 weeks were in clinical remission. High- and low-dose 
groups (36/93 [38.7%] versus 27/95 [28.4%]) showed no 
significant difference (P=0.075).24 Patients who completed 
IMAgINE 1 were eligible to enroll in IMAgINE 2. A total 
of 100 children participated for up to 240 weeks. A total of 
41% and 48% achieved remission (pediatric CDAI ≤10) and 
response (pediatric CDAI decrease ≥15 from IMAgINE 1 
baseline) at 240 weeks, respectively. The safety profile was 
similar to those in adult CD trials with adalimumab and 
IMAgINE 1 trial.25
Dosing in UC
The recommended dose regimen for UC is 160 mg SC on 
day 1 (or 80 mg on two consecutive days) followed by a dose 
of 80 mg on day 15 and, 2 weeks later (day 29), continues 
with a dose of 40 mg EOW
.14 A meta-analysis of three RCTs 
reported that adalimumab 160/80 mg was more efficacious 
when compared with placebo for the induction of clinical 
remission (relative risk [RR] 1.62, 95% CI 1.15, 2.29) and 
clinical response (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.19, 1.59). Similarly, 
adalimumab 40 mg EOW was more effective than placebo 
in maintaining clinical remission (RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.57, 
3.59) and clinical response (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.29, 2.21).26

Role of biologics and biosimilars in IBD
Side effects
The most serious adverse reactions encountered in clinical 
trials were serious infections due to immunosuppression, 
malignancies, and demyelinating neurological disease.14 
Serious infections include pneumonia, septic arthritis, 
prosthetic/postsurgical infections, erysipelas, cellulitis, 
diverticulitis, and pyelonephritis at an incidence rate of 
0.04/patient-year (PY) when compared with 0.02/PY in the 
placebo arm.14 The most frequently encountered malignan-
cies other than lymphoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers 
(NMSC) include breast cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, 
melanoma, and prostate cancer at a rate of 0.6 (95% CI 
0.3, 1.0)/100 PYs in 3853 adalimumab (Humira)-treated 
patients for a median duration of 5.5 months versus 0.4 
(95% CI 0.2, 1.0)/100 PYs in 2183 controls for a medical 
duration of 3.9 months. However, based on a recent pooled 
estimate from 23,458 patients treated with adalimumab on 
comparison with age- and sex-matched populations, the 
observed number of malignancies in each disease popula-
tion was reported to be similar to the expected number 
in the reference population.27 The rates for lymphomas 
(0.1/100 PYs) and NMSC (0.2/100 PYs) were very low.27 
Some of the common side effects include injection site 
pain and reaction, hypersensitivity, and gastrointestinal 
disturbances. In contrast, rare adverse effects result in the 
reactivation of latent tuberculosis, autoantibody produc-
tion leading to a lupus-like syndrome, blood dyscrasias, 
congestive cardiac failure, and interstitial lung diseases.28 
Humira comes under category B for its use in pregnancy 
as animal studies have proven to be safe but controlled 
studies in humans are lacking.14 Its use in lactation is based 
on the benefit–risk ratio as decided by the doctor because 
it is unknown if adalimumab is excreted in breast milk or 
absorbed systemically.14 Its use in children has not been 
evaluated, and it should be used judiciously in geriatric 
population as there is already an increased risk of infec-
tions and malignancies in elderly.14
Certolizumab pegol (Cimzia®)
Mechanism of action and indications
Certolizumab pegol is a monoclonal antibody (MAb) manu-
factured by Union Chimique Belge (UCB) Pharmaceuticals 
(Brussels, Belgium) and subsequently approved by the FDA 
in April 2008 for CD.29 Certolizumab pegol is a recombinant 
antigen-binding fragment (Fab) antibody against TNF-α, 
which is conjugated to 40 kDa polyethylene glycol, thereby 
enhancing the bioavailability, drug stability, and plasma 
half-life.30 The molecular mass of the Fab antibody frag-
ment alone is 47.8 kDa. It is the only crystallizable frag-
ment (Fc)-free PEGylated TNF-α inhibitor, so it does not 
fix complement or cause antibody-dependent cell-mediated 
cytotoxicity.30 The FDA-approved indications are moderate-
to-severely active CD or RA, active psoriatic arthropathy, 
and ankylosing spondylitis.29 It is available as powdered 
reconstitution form, which contains 200 mg of sterile, white, 
lyophilized powder, and as prefilled syringe, which is a 
single-use, 1 mL prefilled glass syringe with a fixed 25 G 
1/2 in thin wall needle, providing a dose of 200 mg/1 mL.29 
Upon single SC dose or intravenous (IV) dose, there was 
a predictable dose-related plasma concentration. There is a 
linear relationship between the dose given and the maximum 
plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the curve over 
time. Though metabolism studies have not been performed 
in humans, animal studies suggest that polyethylene glycol 
polymers are excreted unchanged in urine and the terminal 
plasma half-life is ~14 days.29
Dosing in CD
The recommended regimen in CD is the SC administration 
of 400 mg initially and at weeks 2 and 4. If there is response, 
400 mg SC is given once in every 4 weeks for maintenance.29 
The efficacy of certolizumab is proven by the PRECiSE-1 
study, which was an RCT done at 171 sites where 331 patients 
with moderate-to-severe CD were randomized to receive 
400 mg certolizumab and 328 patients received placebo. 
At week 6, clinical response (100-point reduction in CDAI 
score) was 35% when compared with 27% in the placebo 
group (P=0.02). At week 26, the clinical remission (CDAI 
≤150 points) was 29% in the certolizumab group versus 
18% in the placebo group (P<0.05).31 Fistula closure rates 
were same at short term and long term with certolizumab 
when compared with placebo.31 PRECiSE-2 study evalu-
ated patients who had clinical response with certolizumab 
at week 6 and were randomized to receive certolizumab 
400 mg (n=216) or placebo (n=212) every 4 weeks over 
weeks 8–24 for maintenance therapy. The remission rates 
were 48% and 29%, respectively, at week 26.32 Patients com-
pleting PRECiSE-1 and -2 received open-label certolizumab 
400 mg every 4 weeks for 7 years in PRECiSE-3 trial, and 
the clinical remission rate was ≥68% at each year based on

responders to infliximab, which was given open-label induc-
tion, showed 62% response rates and 39.3% remission rates, 
despite being a difficult-to-treat group.35
Side effects
The common adverse effects include injection site reactions 
and infections mainly of the respiratory tract and urinary 
tract; some of which can be very severe due to immune 
modulation. Similar to the other drugs in the class, reactiva-
tion of tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and malignancies have been 
reported, but hypersensitivity reactions are rare.36 Some of 
the other rare adverse effects reported in controlled trials are 
blood dyscrasias, optic neuritis, hepatitis, alopecia totalis, 
anxiety, bipolar disorder, suicidal tendencies, nephrotic syn-
drome, renal failure, menstrual disorders, and dermatitis.29 
Certolizumab is a category B drug in pregnancy. Animal 
studies have proven no harm, but controlled human stud-
ies are not done.29 Because of its large molecular weight, 
it neither crosses the placental barrier nor gets secreted in 
the milk. Even if present in milk, the biologics would get 
degraded in the intestinal tract, but the local effect in the 
mucosa is not known.29 It is not recommended in pediatric 
use, and caution should be excised regarding its use in 
elderly due to the risk of malignancy and opportunistic 
infections.29
Golimumab (Simponi®)
Mechanism of action and indications
Golimumab is yet another fully human IgG1 kappa MAb first 
approved in 2009 by FDA for the treatment of RA. It was 
developed and marketed by Janssen Biotech, Inc (Horsham, 
PA, USA).37 It was isolated from a hybridoma clone produced 
by transgenic mice, which were immunized with human TNF-
α. The commercial product, which is produced in a recombi-
nant cell line culture, binds to the soluble and transmembrane 
forms of TNF-α and acts as an inhibitor.38 This agent has 
been approved for use in moderately to severely active RA, 
psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and moderately to 
severely active UC.39 The European Medicines Agency has 
further approved it for JIA in combination with methotrexate 
for children >40 kg body weight.40 It is available as prefilled 
glass syringes (27G 1/2 in) providing either 50 mg/0.5 mL 
or 100 mg/1 mL of solution.39 Upon SC administration, the 
bioavailability was 53% and gets primarily distributed in the 
circulatory system with limited extravascular distribution.39 
The terminal plasma half-life is ~2 weeks, and the metabolic 
pathway is not known.39
Dosing in UC
The recommended dosage regimen for UC is 200 mg SC 
at week 0 followed by 100 mg at week 2 and maintenance 
therapy 100 mg once every 4 weeks.39 in the PURSUIT-SC, a 
Phase II/III multicenter, placebo-controlled, induction RCT, 
anti-TNF-naive patients with moderately to severely active 
UC were assigned randomly to receive placebo, or two goli-
mumab regimens were given 2 weeks apart (200 mg followed 
by 100 mg or 400 mg followed by 200 mg). At week 6, both 
the golimumab regimens induced significant clinical response 
(30 versus 51 and 55%, both P<0.0001) and clinical remission 
(6 versus 18 and 18%, both P<0.0001).41 In the PURSUIT-
M RCT, patients in clinical response were randomized to 
receive either placebo or two regimens of golimumab (50 or 
100 mg every 4 weeks) for 52 weeks. At week 54, patients 
on golimumab achieved more continuous clinical response 
(31 versus 47 and 50%, P=0.01 and <0.001) and remission 
(16 versus 23 and 28%, P=0.12 and 0.004).42
Side effects
The common adverse events noted were infections and 
injection site reactions, which were similar in number to the 
placebo arm.43 Golimumab as the other TNF-α inhibitors can 
rarely cause severe infections, opportunistic infection, reac-
tivation of tuberculosis, malignancies, heart failure, autoim-
munity, and demyelinating disorders.43 It belongs to a category 
B drug in pregnancy as animal studies have shown no harm, 
but controlled human studies are lacking.39 The information 
regarding secretion into human milk, the effect on breastfed 
infant, or lactation is not known.39 Efficacy in children is not 
well established with one study on pediatric juvenile idio-
pathic arthritis demonstrating no efficacy but similar rate of 
adverse events when compared with adults.44 Caution should 
be exerted while using in elderly due to increased risk of 
infections and malignancy with increasing age.39
Infliximab (Remicade®)
Mechanism of action and indications
Infliximab is an engineered chimeric IgG1 MAb and created 
by combining mouse and human TNF that has increased the 
specificity and affinity to the TNF-α receptor. In 1988 at 
New 
Y
ork University’s School of Medicine, this MAb against 
TNF has been discovered.45 Remicade was the first TNF-α 
blocking agent approved by the FDA, initially for treating 
CD, in 1998. This is produced when the variable regions of 
a murine antibody (25%) are fused with the constant regions 
of a human antibody (75%) at the hinge region using genetic

Role of biologics and biosimilars in IBD
engineering.46 It is indicated for use in CD (pediatric and 
adult), UC (pediatric and adult), RA, ankylosing spondy-
litis, psoriatic arthritis, and plaque psoriasis.47 The agent is 
supplied as a sterile, white, lyophilized 100 mg powder for 
IV infusion in a 20 mL vial. Each single-dose vial contains 
infliximab (100 mg), dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate 
(6.1 mg), monobasic sodium phosphate, monohydrate 
(2.2 mg), polysorbate 80 (0.5 mg), and sucrose (500 mg) and 
no preservatives.47 In adults, single IV infusion of 3–20 mg/
kg showed a linear relationship between the dose that was 
administered and the maximum serum concentration.47 It acts 
by inhibiting the binding of TNF-α with its receptors. This 
results in the induction of proinflammatory cytokines such 
as IL-1 and IL-6. This causes an enhancement of leukocyte 
migration by increasing endothelial layer permeability and 
the expression of adhesion molecules by endothelial cells 
and leukocytes and results in the activation of neutrophil 
and eosinophil functional activities and the induction of 
acute-phase reactants and other liver proteins, as well as 
tissue-degrading enzymes produced by synoviocytes and/or 
chondrocytes.47 Infliximab does not neutralize TNF-β, and 
the median terminal half-life of infliximab is 7.7–9.5 days.47
Dosing in CD and UC
The recommended dose is 5 mg/kg at 0, 2, and 6 weeks, 
which is followed by the maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg 
every 8 weeks after that for the treatment of CD or UC in 
both adults and children.47 For adult patients with CD who 
respond and then lose their response, consideration may be 
given to treatment with 10 mg/kg.47 In the Targan study, 65% 
of patients with active CD had a clinical response at weeks 
to doses 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg versus 17% for placebo with 
no dose–response effect. The remission rates were 33 versus 
4%. In the ACCENT-1 trial with 573 patients and dose of 
5 mg/kg, 58% achieved a clinical response and 28% achieved 
remission at week 2. It was also found that three loading doses 
at weeks 0, 2, and 6 had significantly higher response rate at 
week 10 when compared with a single infusion at week 0 (69 
versus 59%, P=0.035).48 In the ACCENT-1 maintenance trial, 
all patients received an induction dose of 5 mg/kg infliximab 
IV and then they were randomized to receive placebo or 
infliximab two doses (5 or 10 mg/kg) for 1 year once every 
8 weeks. The proportion of patients who had remission at 
2 weeks and continued to be in remission at 30 weeks was 
21%, 44%, and 45%.49 The evidence for the usefulness of 
infliximab in UC was mainly by two RCTs namely ACT-1 and 
ACT-2.50 In ACT-1, 69% and 62% of patients who received 
infliximab 5 and 10 mg/kg, respectively, at weeks 0, 2, and 6, 
had desired clinical response at week 8, in comparison to 37% 
of those receiving placebo (P<0.002 for both comparisons).51 
In ACT-2, 65% and 69% of patients who received infliximab 
5 and 10 mg/kg, respectively, achieved a clinical response 
at week 8, when compared with 26% of those receiving 
placebo (P<0.001 for both comparisons).52 A study done by 
Cote-Daigneault et al has shown the evidence for efficacy in 
fistulizing CD and achieving mucosal healing in CD unlike 
certolizumab and in UC.23
Side effects
The main adverse effect includes the development of antibod-
ies that may lead to the loss of response, infusion reactions, 
and serum sickness-like reactions.50 Problems associated 
with immunomodulation as easy susceptibility to infec-
tions, reactivation of tuberculosis, certain malignancies, 
and opportunistic infections are similar as in other TNF-α 
inhibitors.50 There have also been reports of hepatitis, CNS 
vasculitis, and hematological derangements that have been 
reported with the use of infliximab.47 This agent belongs to 
category B in pregnancy, and its effect on a lactating infant 
or its presence in human milk is not known. However, as in 
other IgG antibodies, it is present in the placenta and the 
new born may face difficulties with immune suppression.47 
Its safety and efficacy has been well established in children 
older than 6 years for use in UC and CD. Use of infliximab in 
elderly is advised with caution due to an otherwise increased 
risk of malignancy and infections.47
Integrin receptor antagonists
Vedolizumab (Entyvio)
Mechanism of action and indications
Vedolizumab is a humanized MAb, which was approved by 
the FDA in July 2014 after a priority review. It is essentially 
an integrin α4β7 receptor antagonist, which blocks the 
binding of Mucosal Addressin Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 
(MAdCAM-1) to the integrin receptor, thereby producing 
anti-inflammatory action by preventing T-cell adhesion and 
infiltration.53 Since integrin α4β7 receptors are found more 
in the gut epithelium, vedolizumab is indicated currently for 
moderate-to-severe CD and UC.54 Clinical trials in pediatric 
population are also ongoing for UC and CD since November 
2017.55,56 The agent is available in the market as 300 mg of 
lyophilized cake in a single-dose 20 mL vial for reconstitu-
tion.57 The plasma half-life is ~25 days. The drug undergoes 
a rapid, saturable, and nonlinear elimination at low concen-
tration and a slower, linear, and nonspecific elimination at 
therapeutic or higher concentration.57

Rawla et al
Dosing in CD and UC
Vedolizumab is given as a 300 mg IV infusion at 0, 2, and 
6 weeks and then every 8 weeks after that, for both UC and 
CD. If no improvement is noticed, the drug is withdrawn.57 
In the GEMINI I induction therapy trial, 374 UC patients 
received either vedolizumab 300 mg (n=224) or only placebo 
(n=149) IV at weeks 0 and 2. The rates of clinical response 
(47% versus 26%) and clinical remission (17% versus 5%) 
at week 6 were statistically significant (P<0.001 for both).58 
Those with clinical response at week 6 were randomized to 
receive vedolizumab 300 mg IV every 4 weeks, or every 
8 weeks or placebo for 52 weeks. The rates of clinical remis-
sion were 45% for the vedolizumab 4-weekly group, 52% for 
the vedolizumab 8-weekly group, and 16% for the placebo 
group (P<0.001).58 The CD trials included the GEMINI II 
and GEMINI III, which showed mixed results of efficacy.59 
At week 6 in GEMINI II RCT, clinical remission was seen 
in 14.5% who received vedolizumab and 6.8% who received 
placebo and clinical response was seen in 31.4% who received 
vedolizumab and 25.7% who received placebo (P=0.23). 
Among patients who responded to induction therapy, 39.0% 
and 36.4% of those who received vedolizumab 8- and 
4-weekly, respectively, were in clinical remission at week 52% 
versus 21.6% of those who received placebo (P<0.001 and 
0.004, respectively, for the two vedolizumab groups versus 
placebo).60 GEMINI III trial was conducted in patients with 
TNF antagonist failure, and the remission rates at week 10 
were 26.6% in vedolizumab group versus 12.1% in placebo 
group (nominal P=0.001). The response rates at week 6 were 
39.2% versus 22.3%, respectively (nominal P=0.001).61
Side effects
The most common adverse reactions seen with vedolizumab 
are infusion reactions and infections due to immunomodu-
lation.54 Safety data showed a similar adverse reaction rate 
to placebo.55 Malignancies were reported in 0.4% of those 
treated with vedolizumab, but the long-term exposure was 
limited.57 A potential for immunogenicity was found with 
13% of the patients treated showing antivedolizumab antibod-
ies at 24 weeks.57 Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric 
population have not been established, while in geriatric 
population, no difference in safety and efficacy has been 
observed compared to the adult population.57 Till date, no 
studies have been done with this drug in pregnant women and 
it is rated a category B drug.57 No fetal harm was observed 
in studies done on rabbits and monkeys even at 20 times 
the recommended human dosage.57 Animal studies detected 
vedolizumab in the milk of lactating monkeys, but it is still 
unknown whether it can be generalized to humans. Hence, 
the drug should be used with caution in nursing mothers.57
Natalizumab (Tysabri®)
Mechanism of action and indications
Natalizumab, the first among its drug family, is a humanized 
IgG4 MAb against the α4 chains of integrins and behaves 
as a selective adhesion molecule antagonist inhibiting the 
translocation of leukocytes across blood vessel membranes 
approved by FDA in year 2004.62 The agent is nonspecific to 
antagonize α4β1 integrin (very late antigen [VLA]-4) and the 
α4β7 integrin (lymphocyte Peyer’s patch adhesion molecule 
[LPAM]-1).63 VLA-4 is involved in regulating the trafficking 
of mononuclear leukocytes from the peripheral circulation to 
sites of inflammation, and this mechanism is tapped to treat 
multiple sclerosis.63 The only other indication of use is in CD, 
and the mechanism of action is similar to vedolizumab.63 It 
is available as 300 mg natalizumab in 15 mL (20 mg/mL) IV 
solution in a sterile, single-use vial with no preservatives.64 
Upon administration, the number of circulating leukocytes of 
all types is increased except the absolute neutrophil count.64 
The mean half-life was ~10–11 days, and a steady state con-
centration after a 4-weekly dose was achieved at 24 weeks.64
Dosing in CD
The recommended dose in CD is 300 mg IV infusion over 
1 hour 4-weekly, and the agent was discontinued at 12 weeks 
if no response. It should not be used with concomitant 
immunosuppressants (eg, 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, 
cyclosporine, and methotrexate) or concomitant inhibi-
tors of TNF-α.64 ENACT-1 trial with 905 adult patients 
with moderate-to-severe disease across 142 global centers 
proved the efficacy of natalizumab in CD. Patients randomly 
received 300 mg natalizumab 4-weekly (n=721) or placebo 
(n=181), and clinical response at week 10 was 56% versus 
49% (P=0.05), respectively, while remission was seen in 
37% versus 30% (P=0.12), respectively.65 Those with clinical 
response at week 10 underwent the maintenance phase for 
52 weeks, and the sustained response was 61% versus 28% 
in placebo arm (P<0.0001).65 The next landmark trial was the 
ENCORE trial where 509 adult patients were randomized 
to receive natalizumab or placebo. At week 12, the clinical 
response rate was 60% versus 44% (P=0.001) and the remis-
sion rates were 38% versus 25% (P=0.001), respectively.66
Side effects
The most common adverse effects encountered are a head-
ache, abdominal pain, joint pain, colitis including worsen-

Role of biologics and biosimilars in IBD
ing of CD, influenza syndrome, infection, gastrointestinal 
disturbances, fatigue, pharyngitis, and infusion reaction.67 
The serious adverse reactions as listed by the FDA include 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy due to infection 
with John Cunningham virus, Herpes infections, hepatotox-
icity, hypersensitivity, antibody formation, and immunosup-
pression.64 Natalizumab is a category B drug in pregnancy 
with detection in human milk as well, though its effect on a 
breastfed infant is unknown.64 It is not recommended for use 
in children, and sufficient data are not available to identify 
difference in responses among elderly.64
IL-12 and IL-23 antagonist
Ustekinumab (Stelara®)
Mechanism of action and indications
Ustekinumab is a human IgGIκ MAb against the p40 sub-
unit of IL-12 and IL-23 cytokines. It was first approved in 
Canada in 2008 for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in adult 
patients and later in 2009 by FDA.68 IL-12 and IL-23 play an 
important role in the activation and differentiation of natural 
killer cells and CD4+ T lymphocytes. Hence, blocking their 
action helps in chronic inflammatory conditions such as 
plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and CD.69 It is available 
as IV 130 mg/26 mL (5 mg/mL) solution in a single-dose 
vial and SC 45 mg/0.5 mL or 90 mg/mL solution in a single-
dose prefilled syringe or 45 mg/0.5 mL in a single-dose 
vial.70 Treatment has been shown to decrease the expression 
of mRNA of IL-12 and IL-23. Steady-state concentrations 
are achieved by week 28, and the mean elimination plasma 
half-life ranges from 15 to 45.5 days.70
Dosing in CD
The recommended dosage regimen is a single IV dose, which 
is weight based (260 mg if weight is ≤55 kg, 390 mg if weight 
is >55–85 kg, and 520 mg if weight is >85 kg) followed by 
a maintenance dose of SC 90 mg administered 8-weekly.70
The safety and efficacy of ustekinumab were evaluated 
in three randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clini-
cal namely UNITI-1 and UNITI-2 for induction therapy and 
IM-UNITI for maintenance therapy.68 In the UNITI-1 trial 
(n=741), the clinical response rate at week 6 was 33.7% and 
21.5% (P<0.01) and the remission rate at week 8 was 20.9% 
and 7.3% (P<0.001) in the ustekinumab and placebo arms, 
respectively.71 In the UNITI-2 trial (n=628), the clinical 
response rate at week 6 was 55.5% and 28.7% (P<0.001) and 
the remission rate at week 8 was 40.2% and 19.6% (P<0.001) 
in the ustekinumab and placebo arms, respectively.71 IM-
UNITI trial testing ustekinumab 90 mg SC maintenance 
8-weekly and 12-weekly, 53.1% and 48.8%, respectively, 
were in clinical remission at week 44 when compared with 
35.9% receiving placebo (P=0.005 and 0.04, respectively).72
Side effects
The most common adverse effects encountered were naso-
pharyngitis, injection site erythema, and vulvovaginal can-
didiasis besides other infections. Clinically significant and 
serious infections included anal abscess, gastroenteritis, and 
pneumonia.69 A total of 0.2% of ustekinumab-treated patients 
and placebo-treated patients developed NMSC, whereas 
0.2% of the ustekinumab-treated patients developed other 
cancers, which were none in the placebo group.70 Approxi-
mately 6% of the patients in the psoriasis studies developed 
antiustekinumab antibodies whereas only 3% of the patients 
in the CD studies did so.70 During the postmarketing phase, 
more incidents of hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphy-
laxis, angioedema, rashes, and urticaria have been reported.70 
Human data on effects in pregnancy are not well established 
due to the lack of data. Animal studies have not shown any 
adverse developmental effects on the fetus even at doses >100 
times the recommended human dose.70 Though studies in 
lactating monkeys have shown the presence of ustekinumab 
in the milk, no presence of the drug in human milk has been 
found.70 Safety and efficacy have not been established in the 
pediatric population, and there are no enough data among 
elderly to determine any difference in the safety and efficacy 
as compared to the adult population.70
Biosimilars in IBD
The treatment of IBD imposes a tremendous economic 
burden on the health care system as the cost utilization has 
seen a significant shift from hospitalization to medication, 
especially the biologics.73 With the patent period of many 
of these drugs coming to an end, it is possible to produce 
a similar biologics that could be marketed at a much lower 
price than the innovator biologics, some of which are 
already available in developing countries such as India 
and developed countries such as South Korea.74 These 
drugs are called as biosimilars, which may be defined as a 
biologic product that is highly like the reference biologic 
with no clinically meaningful differences in clinical safety 
or efficacy.75 Biologics are a highly complex protein or 
other substances derived from a biological source, and 
hence, complete reproducibility of reference biologics is 
not possible. Thus, minor differences in clinically inac-
tive components are permissible.76 The current biosimilars 
approved for use in IBD belong to TNF-α inhibitors namely

adalimumab and infliximab.77 Biosimilars of adalimumab 
include adalimumab-atto (Amjevita™) by Amgen Phar-
maceuticals (Thousand Oaks, CA, USA) and adalimumab-
abdm (Cyltezo®) by Boehringer Ingelheim. Amjevita was 
created using recombinant DNA technology in a mammalian 
cell expression system resulting in an antibody with human 
IgG1:k constant regions and human-derived heavy- and 
light-chain variable regions. It was approved by FDA in 
September 2016.78 Cyltezo is again a recombinant human 
IgG1 MAb, which was approved in August 2017.79 The 
indications of these two agents are similar to Humira except 
in hidradenitis suppurativa and uveitis in the same dosage 
regimen with similar efficacy and side effects.78,79
With regard to infliximab, there are again three biosimi-
lars, which are approved by FDA namely infliximab-dyyb 
(Inflectra®) by Pfizer (New 
Y
ork City, NY, USA), infliximab-
abda (Renflexis™) by Samsung Bioepis (Seoul, South 
Korea), and infliximab-qbtx (Ixifi™) by Pfizer in 2016, 
2017, and 2017, respectively.80–82 Both chimeric IgG1κ MAb 
composed of human constant and murine variable regions, 
which are produced by a recombinant cell line cultured.80,81 
These agents are used in the same indications as Remicade 
at same dose with similar efficacy and adverse effects.80,81
Future paradigm
Biologics off late as mentioned has become an important 
modality of treatment in IBD and the mainstay of therapy in 
patients with fistulizing or perianal CD.83 However, the avail-
able treatment has certain drawbacks, the most important of 
which is 30% primary nonresponders.84 Some patients tran-
siently show response but then experience a loss of response 
(secondary nonresponders).85 Besides this, the available 
agents come with a myriad of serious adverse effects such as 
antibody formation, malignancies, reactivation of tuberculo-
sis and hepatitis B as mentioned. Therefore, there is a need 
to develop newer agents that are more effective with fewer 
side effects and agents with novel targets and novel mecha-
nisms of action. Some of these novel targets include Janus 
kinase inhibitors (eg, tofacitinib), IL inhibitors, antisense 
oligonucleotides (eg, mongersen), sphingosine-1-phosphate 
(S1P) receptor agonist (eg, ozanimod), anti-integrin inhibi-
tors, and so on.86 Janus kinase inhibitors interfere with the 
signaling pathway that is needed for inflammatory process, 
whereas the antisense oligonucleotides prevent translation 
process by binding to mRNA from which the protein is usu-
ally synthesized.87,88 S1P receptor agonists decrease the total 
lymphocyte count in circulation, especially CD4+CCR7+ and 
CD8+CCR7+ T cells.89
Conclusion
As the burden of IBD is increasing with time, so is the 
plethora of novel agents under development for its treat-
ment. Initially, biologics were prescribed much later in the 
course of the disease, but this paradigm has changed with 
the increasing availability of evidence that suggests early use 
of biological agents. Also, the focus of treatment has shifted 
from mere supportive or symptomatic to more therapeutic or 
curative. One of the significant hurdles faced currently with 
these newer biologics is the cost and adverse reactions. With 
the availability of biosimilars in the market now, the cost has 
come down drastically, and in the future with novel agents in 
the pipeline, one could expect to see agents with enhanced 
safety and tolerability.
