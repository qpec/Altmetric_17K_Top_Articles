 Design—Case control study.
Setting—Longevity Genes Project (LGP) and New England Centenarian Study (NECS).
Participants—439 LGP (mean age: 97.8 ± 2.8) and 1,498 NECS (mean age: 101.4 ± 4.0) 
participants compared to their respective younger referent cohorts of 696 LGP and 302 NECS 
controls, respectively.
Measurements—Self and proxy reports of age of onset of cancer, cardiovascular disease, 
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, osteoporosis, and stroke.
Results—Long-lived individuals from both LGP and NECS compared to their respective 
younger referent groups delay the age of onset of cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, 
hypertension, and osteoporosis. The relative risk of overall morbidity is 0.12 in NECS males and 
0.20 in NECS females compared to the younger NECS referents and 0.18 in LGP males and 0.24 
in LGP females compared to younger male and female LGP referents. The age at which 20% of 
each of the centenarian groups experienced specific diseases was significantly delayed by between 
18 and 24 years relative to the referent groups, when stratified by sex.
Conclusion—The similar extension of health-span and compression of morbidity seen in both 
the NECS and LGP centenarian samples further validates the utility of these rare individuals for 
the study of factors that delay or prevent a broad spectrum of diseases otherwise associated with 
mortality and disability.

INTRODUCTION
Life expectancy has steadily increased in the US, with a 2011 life expectancy of 78.7 years.1 
A recent Institute of Medicine report suggests that though life expectancy has increased, 
health span has not and longer life expectancy has been associated with greater rates of 
disability.2 An analysis of US data concluded that overall prevalence of disease, the length of 
life with disease, and loss of mobility have increased between 1998 and 2008.3 On the other 
hand, there are individuals who survive long beyond average life expectancy and spend a 
relatively short period of their lives with age-related diseases or disability4, 5. This is most 
evident among those who survive near the limit of human life span6, findings that are 
consistent with James Fries’ compression of morbidity hypothesis7. These findings 
contradict the notion that the older people get, the sicker they get and the more resources 
they require. In fact, Medicare spending on patients during the last year of life has been 
noted to decrease as age at death increases8 and total end-of-life expenditures are lowest for 
the oldest enrollees.9
Various distinct cohorts of individuals with exceptionally long lifespans are being studied 
around the world and in the US and have provided insight into the interactions of morbidity, 
mortality and survival to older ages.10–12 The Long Life Family Study (LLFS) and the New 
England Centenarian Study (NECS) recently found that the overall disease-free survival of 
these long-living individuals was increased compared to their referent cohorts.13 Here, we

 sought to assess compression of morbidity among Longevity Genes Project (LGP) 
participants relative to the NECS findings. While the NECS includes individuals of diverse 
ethnic backgrounds and has a particular focus on centenarians age 105 and above, LGP 
focuses on a younger sample of centenarians of a founder population, Ashkenazi Jews. We 
set out to determine if individuals with exceptional longevity from both NECS and LGP 
share similar delays in disease onset and compression of morbidity. If both cohorts display 
similar delays in morbidity then this study will confirm that results from one population of 
centenarians can be generalized to other populations and that younger centenarians, who are 
more prevalent, can be useful for longevity studies.
METHODS
Participants
LGP—Ashkenazi Jewish individuals, age 95 and older, termed centenarians, although the 
group included both centenarians and near-centenarians, were recruited from the 
northeastern United States for the LGP at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (Einstein) 
between 1998 to present. They were recruited by word of mouth and through advertisements 
in Jewish aging centers and other multi-senior settings. Participants were required to be 
living independently at age 95 as a reflection of good health, although at the time of 
recruitment, at ages older than 95, they could be at any level of dependency. Birth 
certificates or dates of birth as stated on passports were used to verify participants’ ages.
A younger referent group was comprised of Ashkenazi Jewish individuals without parental 
history of longevity, who were also enrolled in aging studies at Einstein. Lack of parental 
history of longevity was defined as neither parent of the referent surviving to age 95 or 
beyond. The group included spouses of the offspring of centenarians from LGP, as well as 
individuals from families without exceptional longevity from the LonGenity cohort. 
Informed consent was obtained from the participants or their proxies if the participant lacked 
decisional capacity. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at 
Einstein.
NECS—The NECS began in 1994 as a population-based study of all centenarians living 
within eight towns in the Boston area.14 In 2000, the study expanded enrollment to include 
centenarians from primarily North America and to a limited degree England, Ireland, 
Australia and New Zealand. Potential participants were identified from state voter registries, 
responses to nursing home and senior center mailings, news items appearing in print and on 
the internet, and enrollment inquiries made directly to the NECS. The only exclusion 
criterion for the NECS has been the inability to validate age. Birth certificates and other 
government issued documentation, such as state and local birth registries, passports, or 
naturalization documents, were used to validate birth dates for 78% of the participants where 
such documentation was available. For the remaining 22% of the participants, we used U.S. 
census data from the late 1800s and early 1900s, which noted the participant’s age at the 
time of the census15–17.
The NECS also enrolled referent participants who were individuals without evident familial 
predisposition for exceptional longevity. This referent group was composed of spouses of

 offspring of centenarians and participants of the same birth cohort as the offspring but where 
at least one parent died at age 73 years, which is the average life expectancy for the 1900 
birth cohort.
Participants or their legally assigned representative (if the subject did not have decisional 
capacity) underwent informed consent, and the study was overseen up until 2001 by Beth 
Israel Deaconess Medical Center’s Institutional Review Board (Boston, MA) and thereafter 
by the Boston University Medical Campus IRB.
Measures
In both LGP and NECS, socio-demographic, vital status, and medical history data were 
collected via mailed questionnaires, telephone calls, or in-person visits. Medical history 
questionnaires in both studies asked similar questions. Next-of-kin/proxy assisted when 
necessary. In the NECS, we compared subject’s (or their proxy’s) responses to the medical 
history questionnaire with their medical records for a random subsample of 25 subjects and 
for the diseases included in the analysis reported here the agreement was 100%.5 Ages of 
onset for the following diseases were ascertained: cancers not including skin cancers, 
cardiovascular disease (CVD), defined as angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias, congestive 
heart failure, and/or myocardial infarction; hypertension (HTN), defined as being on an 
antihypertensive medication or being told by their physician that they have HTN; 
osteoporosis, defined as a having a history of osteoporosis or a history of hip, wrist or spine 
fracture at age 50 or older; stroke; and diabetes mellitus. The disease categories were 
harmonized between the two studies so that for the purpose of this analysis each disease was 
defined the same way in both LGP and NECS. The selected diseases were among the top 10 
leading causes for death in people age 65 years and older according to the United States 
Centers for Disease Control (CDC).18 In LGP centenarians and referents, data on congestive 
heart failure was not elicited, and in NESC referents, data on angina was not elicited. Due to 
the small number of participants with diabetes mellitus in the studies, this disease was 
excluded from the disease-specific analyses due to potentially inaccurate estimates. 
Dementia was not included because of the low sensitivity in determining the presence of this 
disease either in the medical record or when participants or their proxies are asked. Overall 
morbidity was defined as one or more of the diseases listed above, including diabetes 
mellitus.
Data were collected from NECS participants at the time of enrollment and annually 
thereafter. In order to conform to the LGP data, only the disease-related data collected at 
enrollment was used in the disease-related analyses. Further, we included in the NECS data 
only for those centenarians who were at least age 95 at enrollment to better harmonize the 
two studies. Given the differences in the ages of NECS and LGP participants, referents and 
centenarians were not directly compared between the two studies. Rather, centenarians and 
referents were compared within their respective studies.
Statistical Methods
Participants’ phenotypic characteristics are displayed by median, range, and frequencies.

 curves. Age at enrollment was used for censoring because follow-up disease prevalence data 
were not collected in LGP. Missing data were assumed to be missing at random and were 
ignored for purposes of these analyses. Significant differences in hazard rates among groups 
and sex were tested using Bayesian parametric survival analysis with Weibull regression.19 
This approach tailors the Cox proportional hazard regression to model an accelerated hazard 
for increasing ages and offers a simple multivariate parametric approach for the estimation 
of risk and quantiles of specific survival. Comparisons between LGP centenarians and 
referents and NECS centenarians and referents according to sex were summarized by hazard 
ratios (HRs), Table 3, and by the gains of each of disease-free survival in years, which are 
derived from the HRs, Table 2. The percentiles of survival for each disease were chosen to 
approximate the reported prevalence for each disease amongst older adults. Specifically, 
20% prevalence for cancer for ages 65–80 was based on CDC Wonder20 (year 2009); 25% 
prevalence CVD for ages 65 and older was based on MMWR21; 25% prevalence 
hypertension was based on reference22. Because of the low prevalence of osteoporosis and 
stroke in the LGP study participants at enrollment, 25% prevalence of osteoporosis and 10% 
prevalence of stroke were used.
The estimates of hazard-rates, risk, and quantiles of specific survival were computed using 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and uninformative priors were assumed for all 
parameters (essentially, all parameter values were assumed to be, a priori, equally likely). At 
least 11,000 simulated values were used to estimate parameters and produced summaries of 
model fit. Credible intervals were estimated using the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles from the 
samples generated from the posterior distribution. Statistical significance of HRs was based 
on 95% credible intervals. The survival distributions estimated using Weibull regression 
were plotted together with the Kaplan–Meier curves to evaluate adequacy of model fitting by 
visual inspection (see Supplementary Material). All analyses were conducted in Open Bugs 
3.2.3 and R 3.1.1.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows summary statistics of the 4 comparison groups included in the analysis and 
the prevalences of age-related diseases. The analysis included 439 long-lived participants of 
the LGP (74 % female) with an age range of 95–110 years and 696 referent participants 
(51% female) aged 53–93 years. NECS participants consisted of 1,498 long-lived 
individuals (76% female) with an age range of 95–119 years. The younger referent group 
consisted of 302 participants (46.0% female), aged 49–89 years.
Figures 1A–F show sex and disease-specific Kaplan–Meier curves for survival free of each 
of five age-related diseases and overall morbidity-free survival in the four groups. Table 2 
shows the HRs estimated by Bayesian–Weibull regression. Sex had a significant effect on 
age of onset of disease (Table 3; Figure 2). We next summarize the results for overall 
morbidity and by disease.
Overall Morbidity
In the NECS, the risk of morbidity for centenarian females was approximately 1.41 times 
higher than the risk for morbidity for centenarian males (HR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.22–1.61).

 However, there were no significant differences in risk by sex in the other groups. The risk of 
morbidity was significantly lower in each of the centenarian groups compared to the 
corresponding referent groups, with rates of risk for centenarians between 0.12 and 0.24 
times that of the risk for morbidity of the corresponding referent groups. The age at which 
20% of each of the centenarian groups experienced morbidity was significantly delayed by 
between 18 and 24 years relative to the referent groups.
Cancer
Female LGP referents had decreased risk of cancer compared to male LGP referents (HR: 
0.56, 95% CI: 0.33–0.87), Table 2, while the corresponding NECS referents did not show a 
significant difference by sex. Sex did not modify the risk for cancer in the centenarian 
groups. There were significant differences between centenarians and referents in each of the 
two studies. The HR for cancer of male NECS centenarians was 0.08 compared to male 
NECS referents (95% CI: 0.06–0.11) and 0.13 for female NECS centenarians compared to 
female NECS referents (95% CI: 0.09–0.20). The HRs for cancer of the respective 
comparisons for the LGP groups were 0.23 (95% CI: 0.16–0.34) for males and 0.17 (95% 
CI: 0.13–0.22) for females. Figure 2 shows that by the age of approximately 67 years in 
males and 74 years in females, 20% of NECS referents had a cancer event. The age at which 
the same percentage of LGP male referents had a cancer event was approximately 78 years 
while it was 74 for females. The age of cancer incidence was delayed to approximately 96 
years in both male and female LGP centenarians and 97 and 99 years for NECS male and 
female centenarians, respectively, with the differences between the centenarians and the 
referents being significant, Table 2. Table 3 shows the gain of years of cancer-free survival. 
In LGP centenarians, the estimated age at which 20% of subjects had a cancer event was 
delayed by approximately 19 and 22 years compared to LGP referents for males and 
females, respectively. The similar comparison in the NECS study showed a delay of 
approximately 30 and 25 years, respectively.
Cardiovascular Disease
In both the NECS and LGP, female referents had lower risk of CVD compared to male 
referents, Table 2, (NECS HR: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.25–0.55; LGP HR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.29–
0.82). There was a sex difference amongst LGP centenarians as well (HR: 0.66, 95% CI: 
0.46–0.92), though it was not significant in NECS centenarians. All groups displayed 
significant differences between centenarians and referents (HR: 0.14, 95% CI: 0.10–0.19 for 
NECS males; HR: 0.25, 95% CI: 0.16–0.39 for NECS females; HR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.16–
0.34 for LGP males; and HR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.29–0.60 for LGP females). Figure 2 shows 
that 25% of the LGP male centenarians had a CVD event by approximately age 92 
contrasted with approximately 75 years for LGP male referents. For the LGP females, the 
approximate ages were 98 and 86 years, respectively. These age differences were found to be 
even greater for the NECS groups. In the LGP sample, female centenarians showed a 
delayed onset of CVD of 6 years, on average, compared to their male counterparts.
Hypertension
Both the NECS and LGP centenarians demonstrated an increased risk of hypertension in 
females compared with males (NECS HR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.14–1.54; LGP HR: 1.54, 95%

 CI: 1.12–2.07). The centenarian groups all had significantly lower risks for hypertension 
when compared to their corresponding referent groups (male NECS HR: 0.10, 95% CI: 
0.08–0.12, female NECS HR: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.10–0.17, male LGP HR: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.13–
0.24, and female LGP HR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.26–0.41). LGP female centenarians delayed the 
age at which 25% subjects had hypertension by about 17 years versus their female LGP 
referents, while for males, the difference was 27 years. The reduced risk for hypertension in 
NECS centenarians compared to NECS referents translated into approximately 35 years and 
29 years for males and females, respectively. There were significant delays for males in both 
the NECS and LGP centenarian groups of approximately 5 and 7 years, respectively, as 
compared to their female counterparts.
Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis was more prevalent and occurred at statistically significant earlier ages in 
females than males of all four groups (Table 3; Figure 2). Moreover, there were significantly 
lower risks for osteoporosis in both sexes in each study for the centenarians compared to 
referents: NECS males HR: 0.33 (95% CI: 0.20–0.54), LGP males HR: 0.65 (95% CI: 0.44–
0.92), NECS females HR: 0.15 (95% CI: 0.11–0.20), and LGP females HR: 0.40 (95% CI: 
0.29–0.55), Table 2. LGP female centenarians significantly delayed the age at which 25% of 
the subjects had the disease by approximately 12 years compared to female referents, while 
the difference between LGP males was 7 years. Across all groups, males significantly 
delayed the age at which 25% of the subjects had osteoporosis compared to females by 8 
and 13 years for LGP centenarians and referents and 12 and 18 years for NECS centenarians 
and referents, respectively (Table 3).
Stroke
Given the small prevalence of stroke in the LGP study (Table 1), many of the HRs among 
the LGP group were not significant, nor were the delays of onset of stroke for 10% of the 
participants. However, there was a statistically significant reduced risk for stroke for NECS 
centenarians versus NECS referents (Females: HR: 0.13, 95% CI 0.06–0.28; Males: HR 
0.09, 95% CI: 0.05–0.16). Moreover, there was a statistically significant delay in the onset of 
stroke for 10% of NECS centenarians versus referents, of approximately 19 years in females 
and 22 years in males.
DISCUSSION
The results of this study demonstrate that centenarians in both the NECS and LGP cohorts 
markedly and similarly compress morbidity and delay the onset of major age-related 
diseases, as well as overall morbidity, compared to younger referent groups. This work 
validates previous findings that there is a relative compression of morbidity at oldest ages 
and suggests that this observation may be generalizable to ethnically varied longevity 
cohorts. These findings support the premise that centenarians are an ideal sample for the 
study of protective factors that promote healthy aging.
When looking at sex-specific differences in disease-free survival, the female NECS and LGP 
centenarians demonstrated a greater hazard for the prevalence of hypertension compared to

 males. This may be because hypertensive males have a higher mortality compared to 
hypertensive females,23, 24 thus leaving behind a selected cohort of male survivors with a 
low prevalence of hypertension. In contrast, female LGP centenarians were noted to have 
increased disease-free survival compared to male centenarians for CVD. The fact that this 
gender-effect was not noted in the NECS centenarians for CVD may be due to a survival 
bias where men with significant age-related morbidity die at a younger age, selecting for 
healthier male centenarians, particularly at the extremes of old age, and the NECS male 
centenarians were older than the LGP male centenarians. This is consistent with our 
previous findings that the older the age group, the greater the degree of compression of 
morbidity.6 Similar reasoning may explain why female NECS centenarians demonstrated an 
increased risk of overall morbidity compared to male NECS centenarians. However, 
sampling variability may have also played a role. For osteoporosis, males across all of the 
groups displayed a significantly lower hazard in the prevalence of disease compared to 
females. This is consistent with earlier onset of osteoporosis seen in women due to rapid 
decrease in bone mass from loss of estrogen post-menopause. However, this result may also 
be biased because men are screened less frequently for osteoporosis than women and thus 
may remain undiagnosed.
The LGP study previously demonstrated that their centenarians did not practice healthier 
habits throughout their lives compared to their contemporaries, suggesting that environment 
was not an important differentiating factor for these individuals’ enhanced life and health 
spans.25 Half of the subjects were overweight or obese, less than half performed moderate 
exercise, and 60% of the men and 30% of the women were heavy smokers for a significant 
part of their lives. Additionally, the LGP study performed whole genome sequencing of 44 
centenarians, finding that each had an average of 5 mutations that should have resulted in a 
disease but none of them manifested those diseases during their life time.26 Similarly, the 
NECS performed a Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) with 801 centenarians and 
found that they had just as many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with 
diseases as are encountered in the general population.27 The LLFS’s GWAS also led to the 
same conclusion.28 If particularly healthy behaviors and a relative lack of disease-associated 
variants are not primarily responsible for the prolonged health spans that are observed in 
centenarians, then one needs to consider the presence of longevity-associated genetic 
variants, among other factors, that counter the effects of disease-associated variants and 
mechanisms that cause aging. Indeed, genomic discoveries made in centenarians delineate 
several mechanisms underlying exceptional longevity and healthy aging.27, 29, 30 Many of 
the longevity genes discovered in the NECS genetic signatures study have been validated in 
other ethnically diverse centenarian cohorts, including the LGP.31
Several limitations to this analysis are evident. First, the enrollment criteria for both 
centenarians and referents somewhat differ between the two studies. However, evaluated 
separately with the same methods, both studies showed the same pattern of results. Both 
study samples have a healthy volunteer effect, either because LGP requires participants to be 
independently living at the age of 95 and/or because both studies are less likely to enroll 
participants who are highly debilitated and less inclined to participate in any study. Thus, our 
findings are specific to centenarians who are not in the clinically significant disease phase. 
Another limitation of the analysis is that the referent group in the NECS is smaller than the

 centenarian group. Finally, our analysis did not include several leading causes of death 
among older people, such as pulmonary diseases and Alzheimer’s disease.
Although LGP centenarians are on average slightly younger and are of a different genetic 
and ethnic background, they demonstrate similar compression of morbidity compared to 
NECS centenarians. These findings suggest that extension of health-span and compression 
of morbidity is likely generalizable to most centenarian cohorts. Further study into the 
protective factors that contribute to this longevity phenotype could potentially yield 
therapies that target the mechanisms responsible for exceptional longevity and may benefit 
the general aging population. Resulting compression of morbidity can lead not only to less 
chronic debilitating age-related diseases in individuals, but also to significant reductions in 
health costs, termed the “longevity dividend”.32
