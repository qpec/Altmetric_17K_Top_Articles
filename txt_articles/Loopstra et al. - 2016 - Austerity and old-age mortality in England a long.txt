Summary
Objective: There has been significant concern that austerity
measures have negatively impacted health in the UK. We
examined whether budgetary reductions in Pension Credit
and social care have been associated with recent rises in
mortality rates among pensioners aged 85 years and over.
Design: Cross-local authority longitudinal study.
Setting: Three hundred and twenty-four lower tier local
authorities in England.
Main outcome measure: Annual percentage changes in
mortality rates among pensioners aged 85 years or over.
Results: Between 2007 and 2013, each 1% decline in Pension
Credit spending (support for low income pensioners) per
beneficiary was associated with an increase in 0.68% in old-
age mortality (95% CI: 0.41 to 0.95). Each reduction in the
number of beneficiaries per 1000 pensioners was associated
with an increase in 0.20% (95% CI: 0.15 to 0.24). Each 1%
decline in social care spending was associated with a signifi-
cant rise in old-age mortality (0.08%, 95% CI: 0.0006–0.12)
but not after adjusting for Pension Credit spending. Similar
patterns were seen in both men and women. Weaker asso-
ciations observed for those aged 75 to 84 years, and none
among those 65 to 74 years. Categories of service expend-
iture not expected to affect old-age mortality, such as trans-
portation, showed no association.
Conclusions: Rising mortality rates among pensioners aged
85 years and over were linked to reductions in spending on
income support for poor pensioners and social care.
Findings suggest austerity measures
in England have
affected vulnerable old-age adults.

Introduction
The long-term decline in mortality among those aged
85 years and over in England has reversed, since 2010
among men and 2011 among women (Figure 1).1 By
2013, rates for men were 4% higher than in 2010,
while among women they were 6.1% higher. This
was not seen in other older age groups, though the
long-term decline among those aged 75 to 84 years
recently plateaued. Among those aged 65 to 74 years,
and those just under pension age, mortality rates con-
tinued to decline.
These unexplained increases have occurred in the
context of a large-scale experiment with austerity
measures in the UK. With a stated aim to reduce
the deficit, the Coalition government sought cuts
totalling £85 billion.2 It reduced per capita spending
on local services by 23.4% and made structural
reforms to welfare administration and the generosity
and conditions attached to receipt of benefits. In
total, these changes resulted in a net reduction in wel-
fare expenditure of £16.7 billion, about 7% less than
would be expected prior to these reforms.3 The coin-
cidence of rising mortality and budget cuts has led
several commentators to speculate that there might
be a causal relationship.
Healthcare professionals are in the front line when
it comes to dealing with the health consequences of
some of these policies. A survey published in the BMJ
in 2013 found that, among over 1000 GPs surveyed,
68% indicated that they had seen evidence of their
patients’ health being affected by reductions to their
benefits, and 94% said their workload had increased
to some degree due to increasing financial hardship
among their patients.4 Rising claims for homelessness
assistance have been linked to reduced spending on
housing services and welfare support.5 Food bank use
has been highest in areas facing largest cuts to benefit
spending and where most claimants have had their
benefit payments stopped for failing to meet certain
conditions.6 Fit-for-work tests have coincided with
rising suicides, prescriptions for anti-depressants
and declining mental health.7 In turn, there have
been calls for medical professionals to be involved

 in assessing whether welfare benefits were adequate to
ensure the health of their patients and to act as advo-
cates where they see need emerging.8,9
In this context of austerity, alongside rising old-
age mortality, there have been concerns among clin-
icians and public health practitioners that the welfare
system is losing its ability to provide adequate sup-
port and care for older persons. Public Health
England examined mortality at ages over 65 years
and considered three possible explanations – statis-
tical artefact, influenza and cold weather – conclud-
ing that the increase was linked to a prolonged flu
season and especially cold winter in 2012.1 The
report did not consider reductions in government
expenditure, but the possibility of these links was
raised in a recent New Statesman article, asking
‘Why are the old dying before their time?’10 Citing
recent data from the Office of National Statistics
showing declining life expectancies, it raised concerns
that reduced social care for the elderly and other
community services for the elderly may explain
these
trends.
These
concerns
were
shared
by
Caroline Abrahams from Age UK, who stated ‘the
most obvious likely culprit is the rapid decline of
state-funded social care in recent years, which is leav-
ing hundreds of thousands of older people to struggle
on alone at home without any help’.11
If Public Health England’s attribution of rising
mortality to cold weather and flu is correct, then it
should
lead
to
an
elevation
of
mortality
in
regional swathes across the nation. However, as
noted in their report,1 and as shown in more
detail in Figure 2, trends have varied considerably
across local authorities, with no apparent geo-
graphic patterning consistent with regional out-
breaks.
About
one-quarter
of
local
authorities
actually experienced a decline in old-age mortality
deaths over 2011 to 2012, while another quarter
experienced especially large rises of 9%.
Here, we test the hypothesis that reductions in
spending on the various forms of social and economic
support which benefit older people could impact on
mortality rates. Although the basic state pension has
been protected from public spending cuts, with a
‘Triple lock’ increasing it by the highest figure of
inflation, average earnings or 2.5%, unlike other wel-
fare benefits, there have been substantial cuts in two
major areas particularly affecting older people. First,
the Coalition government reduced Pension Credits,
which provide financial support to pensioners on
low incomes. This has two components, Guarantee
Credit, which guarantees that all pensioners receive
a weekly income of £151.20 (single) or £230.85, some-
what higher than the basic state pension, and Savings
Credit, which gives those with small amounts of sav-
ings additional cash payments. Both also give recipi-
ents entitlement to a range of other benefits, such as
reduced Council Tax. In 2011, the government froze
weekly
Savings
Credit
payments,
and
in
2012,
increased eligibility thresholds leading to a significant

National Statistics.

 reduction in claimants and a reduction in payments
(Web Appendix Table A1). As shown in Figure 3,
average spending on Pension Credit dropped from
£759 per pensioner in 2011 to less than £675 per pen-
sioner in 2012.
Second, local authorities have reduced spending
on social care to achieve budget deficit targets. This
includes reduced funding for residential care, day and
domiciliary care, and assessment and care manage-
ment for elderly people. The Institute for Fiscal
Studies has calculated that while spending on health
increased by 4.3% in real terms during 2010–2011
and 2014–2015, spending on social care fell by
11.5%.12 Social care spending on older people has
been especially hard hit; spending on people aged
65 years and over made up only 51% of total adult
social care spending in 2013–2014, down from 56% in
2009–2010.13
Using data from 324 local authorities in England
spanning 2007–2013, we test the hypothesis that
budgetary reductions in spending on Pension Credit
and social care and reductions in the number of
Pension Credit beneficiaries are associated with
increasing
mortality
observed
among
pensioners
aged 85 years and over.
Methods
Data
We collected data on age-specific mortality from the
Office for National Statistics for 324 lower-tier local
Figure 2. Change in mortality rates among pensioners aged over 85 years across local authorities in England, 2011 to 2012.

111
 authorities in England (excluding City of London
and Isles of Scilly due to small population size),
which were available for years covering 2007 to
2013.14 We used annual population estimates to cal-
culate mortality rates for all persons aged 85 years
and over per 1000 population. These data were
matched to local authority data on welfare expend-
iture, including social care from the Department of
Communities and Local Government, and on state
pensions and Pension Credit from the Department
for Work and Pensions.15,16 Because upper tier coun-
cils control spending on social care and some other
services, these expenditures were allocated to lower-
tier districts by their population weightings within the
overall council. All spending data are in constant
pounds
per
capita.
We
obtained
data
on
the
number
of
Pension
Credit
beneficiaries
from
Nomis.17 The count for every quarter was averaged
over fiscal years and divided by the number of pen-
sioners in local authorities to obtain the annual
prevalence of Pension Credit beneficiaries.
Statistical model
We used a multiple linear regression model to assess
the association of changes in mortality rates with
changes in welfare provisioning for older-age adults.
Specifically, we used a first difference model, examin-
ing how the annual change prevalence of Pension
Credit
beneficiaries,
amount
spent
on
Pension
Credit per beneficiary, and the amount of spending
per capita on social care in local authorities related to
the annual percentage change in mortality for pen-
sioners aged over 85 years, as follows:
�Age 85 þ mortality rateit
¼ � þ �� Proportion of pensioner population
receiving Pension Creditit
þ � �Pension Credit spending per beneficiaryit
þ � �Social Care spending per capitait þ year þ "it
Here i is local authority and t is year. Spending
data were converted into annual percent changes per
capita. This approach controls for between-area dif-
ferences by only examining the associations between
changes in spending and benefit coverage in relation
to changes in mortality within each local authority.
Thereby, fixed characteristics influencing differences
in mortality rates between areas are unlikely to con-
found our analysis. To correct for pre-existing time
trends, we included an adjustment for the linear time-
trend.
These analyses were conducted for total mortality
rates and for men and women separately. Though we
hypothesised that, given their vulnerability, it would
be the oldest groups that would be most affected by
cuts in spending, we also examined these relation-
ships using changes in mortality rates among pen-
sioners aged 65 to 74 years and 75 to 84 years to
test the specificity of our findings. We removed out-
liers from local authorities where annual percentage

 changes in mortality and spending were >j20%j and
those in which standardised residuals exceeded two
standard deviations because of instability due to
small numbers in some authorities, although the
results were not qualitatively affected by this step.
All models were computed using STATAv13.0 with
robust standard errors adjusted for clustering effects
of local authorities.
Results
Table 1 shows the results of the cross-local authority
statistical models. There was a significant associ-
ation between both declines in Pension Credit
spending per beneficiary and the number of benefi-
ciaries with increases in age-85þ mortality. Each 1%
reduction in Pension Credit spending was associated
with a 0.65% rise (95% CI: 0.0.38–0.93%), and each
decline of one beneficiary per 1000 pensioners was
associated with an increase in mortality of 0.20%
(95% CI: 0.15–0.24%). To put the magnitude of
these associations in perspective, our model esti-
mates that the average drop in Pension Credit
spending in 2012 of 2.87% corresponds to a 1.37%
rise in mortality (95% CI: 0.70–2.04%), and the
decline in Pension Credit beneficiaries observed in
2012 (27 per 1000 pensioners) translates to a rise
of 2.69% in mortality (95% CI: 1.93–3.44%).
Together, these changes are of a sufficient magnitude
to explain almost 90% of the observed 4.56% rise in
mortality of that year.
We also found that greater reductions in social
care per capita were associated with a significant
rise in old-age mortality (0.08%, 95% CI: 0.006–
0.015%, but, as shown in Table 1, this association
was attenuated to non-significance after adjusting
for changes in Pension Credit beneficiaries and
expenditure (0.04; 95% CI: �0.03 to 0.12).
We further disaggregated models by age and sex.
As shown in Table 1, the patterns were similar for
both men and women aged 85 years and over.
However, we observed that the associations were
weaker for pensioners in age categories 75–84 years
and not statistically significant for those aged 65–74
years (Table 2).
Robustness checks
We performed a series of robustness and specificity
checks. First, we incorporated additional data from
Nomis that specified beneficiaries of the Savings
Credit and Guarantee Credit portions of Pension
Credit coverage separately, and provided information
on
average
weekly
spending
per
beneficiary.
Consistent with the changes that were made to
Savings Credit in 2011 and 2012, we observed that
annual reductions in spending and coverage in the
Savings Credit portion of Pension Credit were more
strongly associated with increasing old-age mortality
(Web Table A3). Second, we examined different cate-
gories of local authority spending, including total
spending, transportation, central services and cultural

 and recreational services, to check the specificity of
our findings. None was significantly associated with
old-age mortality rates (Web Table A4). Next, we
adjusted for the level of state pension spending,
which was not reduced during this period. Our
main findings were unchanged; consistent with the
observation that Pension Credits were protective,
we found that each 1% increase in spending on
state pensions was associated with a significant
decrease in old-age mortality of 0.55% (95% CI:
0.26–0.85%) (Web Table A4, model 6).
Discussion
Principal findings
Our results suggest that budgetary reductions to
incomes of the poorest pensioners may have increased
their vulnerability and risk of mortality. There was a
strong association of reductions in spending on
Pension Credit and reductions in Pension Credit cover-
age with rising age-85þ mortality rates.
Strengths and weaknesses
To our knowledge, this study is the first to link data
on welfare spending to old-age mortality rates in the
UK for recent years, in a period when death rates
have risen. Using cross-local authority variation, we
were able to identify associations with different cate-
gories of welfare spending. Falsification tests showed
a high degree of specificity in our findings. For exam-
ple, it was the Savings Credit portion of Pension
Credit, which underwent changes in both eligibility
and generosity that was most strongly associated
with increasing mortality among those in the oldest
age group. We also observed an association with
social care spending, but did not find associations
with other areas of spending that would not be
expected to have an impact on old-age mortality,
but which underwent cuts between 2011 and 2013.
Furthermore, we would expect that cuts to spending
would impact the oldest, most vulnerable pensioner
groups, and indeed, observed no, or only weak, asso-
ciations with younger pensioner groups.
The statistical analysis has several limitations,
however. First, we could not investigate relationships
between changes in receipt of welfare and social care
and risk of mortality at the individual level as such
data were not available to test this research question.
Thus, our analysis is ecological and could be vulner-
able to ecological fallacy. Second, ideally this study
would examine what conditions those over 85 years
are dying from to identify the mechanisms involved.
However, cause of death coding is notoriously unre-
liable at these ages. Those who reach the age of 85
years often have multiple disorders, any one of which
could be identified as the cause of death.18 Moreover,
there may be geographical clustering related to
custom and practice in attribution of deaths at
these ages to particular causes. Nonetheless, many
of the common causes of death in older people in
England are associated with risk factors such as
cold and impaired nutrition, with another form of
income supplementation in older people, winter fuel
payments, linked to about half of the decline in excess
winter mortality observed in England during the
1990s.19 Thus, the findings are biologically plausible.
The limitations of death coding among the oldest
people prevent detailed assessment of the causes of
the increased deaths. However, if influenza has
indeed played a role it seems most likely to be

 among those rendered vulnerable by welfare cuts.
Previous research in England has shown that mortal-
ity from influenza is twice or three times as high in the
most deprived areas20,21 so, even if influenza is impli-
cated, the findings presented here suggest that its
associated mortality may be affected by changes to
the Pension Credit system or reduced care for elderly
people. As with all statistical analysis of observa-
tional studies, there is potential for other unobserved,
time-varying
confounding
factors,
although
we
adjusted for pre-existing time trends and relatively
fixed differences across local authorities in surveil-
lance and monitoring.
Another possibility to be considered is the exist-
ence of a cohort effect. Yet those now aged 85 years,
the so-called ‘golden generation’ have been one of the
most intensely studied from this point of view as they
have shown especially high rates of health improve-
ment throughout life.22 Thus, the current decline is
especially surprising. Finally, we were unable to
examine social care spending on pensioners specific-
ally, which could have biased our estimate of the
impact of social care cuts downward.
Implications for clinicians and policymakers
Pensioners have been one group thought to be pro-
tected from austerity policy, as much emphasis has
been placed on promises to protect the state pension,
as illustrated by the aforementioned ‘Triple Lock’.
However, this does not apply to the Pension Credit,
which directly impacts upon the poorest older age
adults, one of the most vulnerable groups in the
population.
While ostensibly the decline in Pension Credit
spending may seem relatively small, it is important
not to consider this narrowly in relation to total
income, but rather in relation to residual income
after fixed costs of housing and basic utilities are
taken account of. For the poorest pensioners, a
change of even a few pounds could make a consider-
able difference to disposable income.23 As reported,
declines of this magnitude can cause significant stress
and anxiety to people of older ages, which could pre-
cipitate heart attack or stroke. Other plausible mech-
anisms could include reduced nutrition, inadequate
heating, damp or other health damaging circum-
stances, and social isolation. In addition, as noted
above, losing eligibility will remove entitlement to
other benefits. It is not possible, with the data avail-
able, to determine with certainty the mechanisms that
might be involved in increased mortality. This com-
plexity, and the multiple pathways involved, means
that qualitative research may be more helpful in elu-
cidating the roles that they play.
Our findings also have implications for the NHS.
Many health service professionals have expressed
concern about increasing pressure on their services
attributable to cuts to social security spending.24
In conclusion, it has widely been assumed that
pensioners have been spared the worst of budgetary
reductions and welfare reforms. However, some have
questioned this25 and the analysis presented here sug-
gests that this is not, in fact, the case. Both recent and
proposed future changes to welfare spending fall
heavily upon pensioners.26 The social care spending
gap, exacerbated by population ageing and rising
demand for services, has been projected to be £2.8
to £3.5 billion by 2019/20.27 This suggests things
will get worse for vulnerable old-age pensioners.
Healthcare professionals are witnesses to the conse-
quences of these cuts, and thus have a crucial role in
drawing attention to them and advocating publicly
for policies that protect some of the most vulnerable
individuals in society.
