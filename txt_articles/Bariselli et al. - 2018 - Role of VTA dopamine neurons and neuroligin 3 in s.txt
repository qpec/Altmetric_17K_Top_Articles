Atypical habituation and aberrant exploration of novel stimuli have been related to the
severity of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), but the underlying neuronal circuits are
unknown. Here we show that chemogenetic inhibition of dopamine (DA) neurons of
the ventral tegmental area (VTA) attenuates exploration toward nonfamiliar conspecifics and
interferes with the reinforcing properties of nonfamiliar conspecific interaction in mice.
Exploration of nonfamiliar stimuli is associated with the insertion of GluA2-lacking AMPA
receptors at excitatory synapses on VTA DA neurons. These synaptic adaptations persist
upon repeated exposure to social stimuli and sustain conspecific interaction. Global or VTA
DA neuron-specific loss of the ASD-associated synaptic adhesion molecule neuroligin 3
alters the behavioral response toward nonfamiliar conspecifics and the reinforcing properties
of conspecific interaction. These behavioral deficits are accompanied by an aberrant
expression of AMPA receptors and an occlusion of synaptic plasticity. Altogether, these
findings link impaired exploration of nonfamiliar conspecifics to VTA DA neuron dysfunction
in mice.

rom infancy, we encounter an array of diverse stimuli from
the environment. Repeated exposure to a stimulus can result
in habituation whereas nonfamiliar stimuli usually increases
exploratory behavior. Habituation and novelty recognition allow
us focusing attention on what is unknown, promote exploratory
behavior, facilitate learning, and are predictive of cognitive
function later in life1. Several neuropsychiatric disorders are
characterized by deficits in habituation and novelty exploration.
In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), young patients show pro-
longed attention to depictions of objects, but reduced attention to
social stimuli2. Moreover, ASD patients are hyporesponsive to
novel visual stimuli and exhibit slowed habituation to faces3,4.
Such alterations are observed in a significant number of indivi-
duals with ASD, as they have been reported in clinical studies
using diverse stimuli and read-outs5–7. However, the circuits and
neuronal mechanisms underlying this specific aspect of the ASD
phenotype remain largely unknown.
Dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA)
and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) may contribute to the
habituation to familiar stimuli and to the exploration of non-
familiar stimuli. DA neurons increase their activity in response
to novel environments8, to stimuli of positive or negative
value9, and to natural rewards10. Interestingly, these neurons
also respond to nonrewarding novel stimuli and their responses
habituate when the stimulus becomes familiar11,12. This has led
to the proposal that novelty by itself may be rewarding. In
rodents,
nonfamiliar
conspecifics
or
nonfamiliar
objects
increase Ca2+-transients in VTA DA neurons and this activity
is necessary to promote social, but not object exploration13.
Glutamatergic synapses onto DA neurons undergo several
forms of synaptic plasticity that may contribute to the mod-
ification of social interactions in response to experience. Spe-
cific
synaptic
adaptations
have
been
described
during
development, after drug exposure, cue-reward learning, reci-
procal social interactions, and after repeated burst stimulation
of DA neurons14–18. Furthermore, glutamatergic transmission
is altered in several ASD animal models19, and we have recently
shown that deficits in the postnatal development of excitatory
transmission onto VTA DA neurons lead to sociability defi-
cits20. Notably, several studies highlight decreased social reward
processing in patients with ASD21,22, and these alterations have
been hypothesized to precipitate further developmental con-
sequences in social cognition and communication23. Whether
specific forms of synaptic plasticity in the VTA are induced by
exposure to nonfamiliar stimuli (novelty-induced synaptic
plasticity), and whether aberrant plasticity associated with
exploration of nonfamiliar conspecific in the VTA is related to
the maladaptive responses in ASD mouse models is still largely
unknown.
In this study, we parse the response to and the preference for
nonfamiliar conspecifics as specific aspects of sociability con-
trolled by DA neurons. We demonstrate that intact VTA DA
neuron excitability is necessary to express a preference for non-
familiar conspecifics but not for nonfamiliar objects. Additionally,
we adopt a conditioned place preference protocol, based on
interaction with familiar or nonfamiliar conspecific, to demon-
strate that VTA DA neuron function underlies the reinforcing
properties of social interaction. Mice lacking the ASD-associated
synaptic adhesion molecule neuroligin 3 (Nlgn3) exhibit aberrant
exploration of nonfamiliar conspecifics as well as deficit in
habituation processing. These phenotypes are recapitulated by
VTA DA neuron-specific down-regulation of Nlgn3. Finally, we
discovered a form of novelty-induced synaptic plasticity at glu-
tamatergic inputs onto VTA DA neurons that sustains conspecific
interactions and is impaired in Nlgn3 KO and Nlgn3 VTA DA
knockdown mice.
Results
VTA DA neurons and exploration of nonfamiliar conspecifics.
Mice have been reported to interact with their conspecifics, to
habituate upon repeated contact with the same subject, and to
exhibit increased exploration when subsequently brought into
contact with a nonfamiliar mouse24. To examine whether VTA
DA neurons regulate exploration of nonfamiliar conspecifics, we
examined the behavior of mice in which the inhibitory DREADD
(hM4Di)25 or mCherry were virally expressed in DA neurons of
the VTA (VTA::DAhM4Di: AAV5-hSyn-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry or
VTA::DAmCherry: AAV5-hSyn-DIO-mCherry injected into DAT-
Cre mice, Fig. 1a). Virus infusions led to mCherry expression in
50% of TH+ (tyrosine hydroxylase, an enzyme necessary for DA
synthesis) VTA neurons and in few (2%) of TH+ cells in the
neighboring substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc; Supplementary
Fig. 1a), confirming preferential targeting of the VTA. Applica-
tion of the hM4Di ligand clozapine-n-oxide (CNO) decreased the
neuronal excitability of VTA::DAhM4Di neurons compared to
VTA::DAmCherry ex vivo (Supplementary Fig. 1b) and decreases
DA release in striatal regions in vivo26.
We then assessed the time spent in social interaction upon
repeated exposure to the same mouse (habituation) and the
subsequent response to a nonfamiliar conspecific (Fig. 1b). To
compare between social and nonsocial stimuli, we also examined
the behavioral responses to familiar and nonfamiliar objects
(Supplementary Fig. 1c–f). When repeatedly exposed to the same
mouse (Fig. 1c) or object stimulus (Supplementary Fig. 1c; s1 and
o1, respectively), VTA::DAhM4Di animals injected with vehicle
show progressive reduction in the interaction with the stimuli
over days. This process has been referred to as habituation27.
After
four
habituation
days,
the
animals
increased
their
exploratory behavior toward either a nonfamiliar social (s2;
Fig. 1d) or a nonfamiliar object stimulus (o2, Supplementary
Fig. 1d) at day 5.
To study the role of VTA DA neurons in this behavioral trait,
DA neuron excitability was decreased by intra-peritoneal (i.p.)
injection of CNO in VTA::DAhM4Di before the exposure to the
nonfamiliar stimulus at day 5. VTA::DAhM4Di animals decreased
their exploratory behavior toward the nonfamiliar conspecific
whereas control VTA::DAmCherry mice treated with CNO showed
unaltered stimulus exploration (s2, Fig. 1e, f). Interestingly, when
exposed to a nonfamiliar object (o2), both VTA::DAhM4Di and
VTA::DAmCherry
animals
treated
with
CNO
exhibited
an
increased exploration (Supplementary Fig. 1e, f). Thus, reducing
VTA DA neuron excitability specifically alters the exploration of
a nonfamiliar conspecific, but not of a nonfamiliar object,
suggesting a differential requirement of DA neuron activity for
driving exploration of social and inanimate stimuli.
VTA DA neurons and preference for nonfamiliar conspecifics.
To assess the role of VTA DA neuron excitability in mediating
the exploration of a nonfamiliar conspecific over an inanimate
object or a familiar conspecific stimulus, VTA::DAhM4Di and
VTA::DAmCherry mice were subject to the three-chamber test28
under vehicle and CNO conditions. The test was performed twice:
first, animals received either vehicle or CNO and, after 1 week of
washout, the test was repeated and the pharmacological treatment
was counterbalanced (Fig. 2a). To monitor potential off target
effects of CNO, we also included VTA::DAmCherry mice treated
with CNO as controls. During the task, test mice were given a
choice between an object (o1) versus a nonfamiliar mouse (s1 or
s3) and subsequently a choice between a familiar (second expo-
sure to s1 or s3) versus a nonfamiliar conspecific (s2 or s4).
Previous studies define sociability in this assay as longer time
spent in the chamber with the same-sex nonfamiliar mouse rather

 than in the chamber with the object, and more time spent sniffing
the same-sex mouse rather than sniffing the object29,30. Accord-
ing to these criteria, VTA::DAhM4Di mice treated with vehicle
(Supplementary Fig. 2a, d), VTA::DAmCherry mice treated with
CNO (Supplementary Fig. 2b, e) as well as VTA::DAhM4Di mice
treated with CNO (Supplementary Fig. 2c, f) exhibited sociability.
We observed a decreased distance moved upon CNO-mediated
reduction of DA neuron excitability (Supplementary Fig. 2g).
However, despite the reduced locomotion, mice still expressed
social preference.
In the second phase of the task, we assessed preference for
social novelty that was defined as follows: longer time spent in the
chamber with the same-sex nonfamiliar rather than in the
chamber with the familiar mouse and more time spent sniffing
the same-sex nonfamiliar conspecific rather than sniffing the
familiar mouse, particularly during the first 5 min of the test28.
While preference for social novelty was exhibited by VTA::
DAhM4Di mice treated with vehicle (Fig. 2b, e) and by VTA::
DAmCherry mice treated with CNO (Fig. 2c, f), it was absent in
VTA::DAhM4Di mice treated with CNO (Fig. 2d, g). CNO treated
VTA::DAhM4Di mice displayed a reduction in distance moved
(Fig. 2h). Additionally, to compare preference for social novelty
across groups, we calculated a “social novelty index”, as time
spent sniffing the nonfamiliar stimulus minus time spent
exploring the familiar target, in the first and last 5 min of the
assay. We found that the social novelty index was reduced by
CNO injections in VTA::DAhM4Di mice compared to both CNO
treated VTA::DAmCherry and vehicle treated VTA::DAhM4Di
(Fig. 2i). Altogether, these findings indicate that reducing the
excitability of DA neurons decreases the exploration of novel
social stimuli, when given a choice between nonfamiliar and
familiar conspecifics.
VTA DA neurons and nonfamiliar conspecific reinforcement.
To investigate whether nonfamiliar conspecific interactions are
reinforcing in mice, we performed a conditioned place preference
(CPP) task (modified from 31, 32). Briefly, test mice are housed
with familiar mice throughout the protocol. After the Pre-TEST,
we performed 4 days of repeated conditioning where wild-type
(WT) mice learn to associate one compartment of the apparatus
with the presence of either a familiar conspecific (familiar, f1), a
nonfamiliar conspecific (s1) or a nonfamiliar object (o1) stimulus,
while the other compartment is left empty (Fig. 3a, b). At day 5

 analyzed, we observed a longer interaction with the nonfamiliar
conspecifics compared to the other stimuli at either time point
(Fig. 3i). These data suggest that a nonfamiliar conspecific
remains salient over days and promotes contextual associative
learning.
To assess the role of VTA DA neuron excitability in mediating
the reinforcing properties of nonfamiliar conspecific interactions,
both control VTA::DAmCherry and VTA::DAhM4Di received
injections of CNO before each conditioning session and were
treated with vehicle before the Post-TEST (Fig. 3j). Control VTA::
DAmCherry but not VTA::DAhM4Di mice developed a preference
for the compartment associated with the nonfamiliar conspecifics
(Fig. 3k and Supplementary Fig. 3d, e). These observations
suggest that the excitability of DA neurons mediates both the
interaction with nonfamiliar conspecifics as well as the acquisi-
tion of nonfamiliar conspecific-induced contextual associations.
Altered conspecific interactions in Nlgn3KO mice. Patients with
ASD exhibit slowed habituation to faces4 and are less responsive
to social reward22. Thus, we tested whether a deletion of Nlgn3 in
mice, a category 2 (strong candidate) classified ASD-linked gene
(http://gene.sfari.org)33–35 encoding a postsynaptic adhesion
molecule36, might result in deficits in exploration of nonfamiliar
conspecifics and in the reinforcing properties of conspecific
interaction. Global Nlgn3KO mice37 exhibit reduced ultrasonic
vocalization and social memory in male–female interactions as
well as altered motor behaviors and olfaction38–41. We examined
the interaction time upon repeated exposure to a familiar mouse
(habituation) and the subsequent response to a nonfamiliar
conspecific (Fig. 4a). Nlgn3KO mice exhibited overall lower
interaction times, no significant habituation, and lacked the
increased response to nonfamiliar conspecifics seen in Wild Type
(WT) littermates (Fig. 4b, c and Supplementary Fig. 4a–d).
However, Nlgn3KO mice showed habituation, increased explora-
tion of nonfamiliar objects (Fig. 4d, e) and preference for non-
familiar objects in a novel object recognition task (Fig. 4f–h). This
indicates that both novelty preference and memory for objects are
unaltered. In addition to impaired response to nonfamiliar con-
specifics, Nlgn3KO mutants exhibit alterations in motor activity
(Fig. 4i) and marble burying (Fig. 4j). In an olfactory dis-
crimination test42, Nlgn3KO male mice showed normal response
and habituation to a social odor (Supplementary Fig. 4e). How-
ever, the mutant mice had a significantly decreased response
when subsequently presented to a second (novel) social odor
(Supplementary Fig. 4e). To further examine conspecific inter-
action in Nlgn3KO mice, we tested the reinforcing properties of
social
interaction31,32.
When
mice
are
conditioned
in
a
conditioned place preference paradigm with familiar mice,
Nlgn3KO mice did not develop a preference for the social com-
partments, whereas WT mice did (Fig. 4k, l, and Supplementary
Fig. 4f, g). These findings suggest that Nlgn3KO mice exhibit
altered social interactions and defects in social reward behaviors.
Nlgn3 loss-of-function in VTA DA neurons alters sociability.
The diverse alterations in social but also nonsocial behaviors in
Nlgn3KO mice, indicate that multiple different systems might
contribute to their phenotype. To test whether any alterations are
due to Nlgn3 functions in VTA DA neurons we generated
microRNA-based knock-down vectors for conditional suppres-
sion of Nlgn3 expression (Supplementary Fig. 5a, b). Cre-
dependent AAV-based vectors were injected into the developing
VTA of DAT-Cre mice at postnatal days 5–6 and mice were
analyzed using a battery of behavioral tests (AAV2-DIO-miRNlgn3
in DAT-Cre mice: VTA::DANL3KD, Fig. 5a, b, and see Supple-
mentary Fig. 5c for off-target areas affected and Supplementary
Fig. 5d, e for further controls). Notably, VTA::DANL3KD mice
exhibited a similar impairment in reinforcing properties of con-
specific interaction as the global Nlgn3KO mice in the conditioned
place preference paradigm (Fig. 5c, d, and Supplementary Fig. 5f,
g) indicating that Nlgn3 downregulation in VTA DA neurons is
sufficient to mimic this aspect of the global Nlgn3KO phenotype.
Furthermore, when repeatedly exposed to the same and subse-
quently to a nonfamiliar conspecific, VTA::DANL3KD mice
showed an overall reduction in social exploration and a blunted
response to novel conspecific stimuli (Fig. 5e–g, and Supple-
mentary Fig. 5h–k). At the same time, VTA::DANL3KD mice
showed preference for novel objects in the novel object recogni-
tion task (Fig. 5h–j). Thus, there is a specific requirement for
Nlgn3 in VTA DA neurons for appropriate exploration of non-
familiar conspecifics and for the reinforcing properties of social
interaction. By contrast, motor activity, marble burying, and
social olfaction that are altered in global Nlgn3KO mice were not
modified in the VTA::DANL3KD mutants (Fig. 5k, l, Supplemen-
tary Fig. 5l). Interestingly, we observed that knock-down of Nlgn3
in VTA-DA neurons of adult mice produced a similar but less
pronounced social interaction phenotype as in developing ani-
mals, with reduced habituation and reduced response to non-
familiar
conspecifics
(Supplementary
Fig.
6).
Thus,
Nlgn3
expression, in both developing and mature VTA DA circuits, is
required for habituation and nonfamiliar conspecific exploration.

 AMPARs, which can be assessed by calculating a rectification
index (RI)17. We tested whether nonfamiliar exploration induced
specific forms of long-lasting synaptic plasticity at excitatory
inputs onto DA neurons in the VTA (novelty-induced synaptic
plasticity). In WT mice, the RI increased at synapses 24 h after the
exploration of either a nonfamiliar mouse or a nonfamiliar object
when compared to RI calculated from home caged mice (Fig. 6a).
By contrast, the RI was unchanged after the exposure to a new
context and AMPA/NMDA ratios were unchanged for any of the
above conditions (Fig. 6b). When AMPAR EPSCs were recorded
after repeated exposure (over 4 days) to object stimuli, the RI was
normalized to control condition (Fig. 6c). A subsequent exposure

 to a new object (o2) increased the RI (Supplementary Fig. 7a). By
contrast, GluA2-lacking AMPARs were detected in mice repeat-
edly exposed to a nonfamiliar conspecific stimulus (s1) over a 4-
day period and were still present at these synapses after 10 days of
repeated exposure (Fig. 6c). Remarkably, the AMPA/NMDA ratio
was significantly elevated after 4 days of social (s1) repeated
exposure relative to baseline but was normalized after 10 days of
repeated exposure (Fig. 6d), while the paired-pulse ratio (PPR)
remained unchanged throughout (Supplementary Fig. 7b). Taken
together, these data indicate that repeated exposure to a non-
familiar conspecific stimulus, but not an object stimulus, tran-
siently increases synaptic strength (AMPA/NMDA ratio) and
produces a stable insertion of GluA2-lacking AMPARs at VTA
DA neuron excitatory inputs.
To understand the functional role of noncanonical AMPARs
inserted during nonfamiliar conspecific exposure, we infused the
GluA2-lacking AMPAR blocker NASPM into the VTA starting
from the second day of interaction with either social or object
stimuli (Fig. 7a, b). NASPM infused mice reduced the interaction
with a conspecific stimulus upon repeated exposure (Fig. 7c); by
contrast, the infusions did not alter long-term habituation to an
object (Fig. 7d), interaction in the home cage between two
familiar mice or distance moved in an open field (Supplementary
Fig. 7c–e). To further understand the impact of GluA2-lacking
AMPARs at VTA DA neuron inputs on conspecific repeated
exposure, we promoted the insertion of GluA2-lacking AMPARs
via blue-light illumination of ChR2 or eYFP expressing VTA DA
neurons18 of DAT-Cre mice (VTA::DAChR2: AAV5-Ef1α-DIO-
ChR2(H134R)-eYFP,
VTA::DAeYFP:
AAV5-Ef1α-DIO-eYFP).
DA neuron stimulation consisted in 15-minute long ChR2-
mediated bursts of action potentials18 delivered the day before
each conspecific exposure (Fig. 7e, f). This noncontingent burst
activation increased RI in photocurrent positive neurons (IChR2+;
Fig. 7g) and blocked habituation to social stimuli (Fig. 7h).
Altogether, these data indicate that GluA2-lacking AMPARs
might represent a synaptic signature of conspecific saliency and,
once inserted, their activity counteracts habituation.
Nlgn3 loss-of-function impairs novelty-induced plasticity.
Nlgn3 has been implicated in the regulation of AMPARs at glu-
tamatergic synapses39. We therefore hypothesized that defects in
DA neuron synaptic function could represent the mechanism
underlying the aberrant habituation to familiar conspecifics and
response to nonfamiliar conspecifics in VTA::DANL3KD mice. We
explored glutamate receptor function in VTA DA neurons of
global Nlgn3KO and conditional VTA::DANL3KD mice. Notably,
we observed increased RI of AMPAR-mediated currents indi-
cating the aberrant presence of GluA2-lacking AMPARs at
excitatory inputs onto VTA DA neurons in both Nlgn3 loss-of-
function models (Fig. 8a). Given the abnormal elevation of
GluA2-lacking AMPARs in naïve VTA::DANL3KD mice, we
hypothesized that in these mice synaptic plasticity induced by
exposure to nonfamiliar conspecifics might be occluded. Indeed,
GluA2-lacking AMPARs in VTA DA neurons were not further
increased 24 h after nonfamiliar social stimulus exposure in
VTA::DANL3KD mice (Fig. 8b). Thus, aberrant plasticity of
GluA2-lacking AMPARs in VTA DA neurons is associated with
an impaired response to a social novel stimulus.
Discussion
In this study, we establish that intact VTA DA neuron excitability
is necessary for (1) the exploration of nonfamiliar social stimuli,
(2) the preference for nonfamiliar versus familiar conspecifics,
and (3) the acquisition of nonfamiliar conspecific-induced con-
textual associations. Novel stimuli, independent of their nature,
leave a plasticity trace at glutamatergic synapses in the VTA,
which persists upon repeated exposure to social stimuli and
supports sustained conspecific interactions. We use a deletion of
the ASD-associated gene Nlgn3 and demonstrate that global
Nlgn3 knock-out results in an impaired habituation and an
aberrant exploration of nonfamiliar conspecifics. Furthermore,
selective inactivation of Nlgn3 in VTA DA neurons disrupts
novelty-induced plasticity at glutamatergic synapses in the VTA,
alters exploration of nonfamiliar conspecific, and the reinforcing
properties of conspecific interactions while having no detectable
effect on motor behaviors or olfaction.
Global loss of Nlgn3 is also accompanied by a broad spectrum
of additional phenotypes, including changes in olfaction and in
motor-related behaviors38–41. Thus, the origin of social behavior
alterations in these mice was unclear. Previous studies explored
phenotypes in mice carrying a point mutation in Nlgn3 that
reduces (but does not abolish) Nlgn3 expression and has been
observed in 2 patients from one family43. For this model, it was
concluded that behavioral phenotypes are significantly dependent
on the genetic context with significant phenotypes reported for
some genetic backgrounds but not others44–46. Our study
demonstrates that VTA DA neuron specific Nlgn3 loss of func-
tion is sufficient to recapitulate sociability deficits reported in
global KO mice.
Although several studies have provided instrumental infor-
mation about the neuronal circuits, within the reward system,
that control social behavior in rodents13,47–49, the synaptic

 adaptations occurring at VTA DA neurons during interactions
with nonfamiliar conspecifics remained largely unknown. Here,
we show that while reduced excitability or conditional suppres-
sion of Nlgn3 in VTA DA neurons affect the exploration of
nonfamiliar conspecifics, they both fail to modify responses to
novel objects, presumably because of the higher intrinsic salience
of social stimuli. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observe that
while both nonfamiliar object and conspecific exploration trigger
the insertion of GluA2-lacking AMPARs, only the repeated

while the insertion of non-canonical AMPARs reflects the novelty
associated to the stimulus, their persistence signals the higher
salience of the conspecific over the object stimulus. The insertion
and the expression of noncanonical AMPARs has been previously
associated with nonsocial and highly salient experiences, such as
cocaine exposure17. However, a causal relationship between

 reported. Here, we show that the insertion of noncanonical
AMPARs at VTA DA
neurons contributes to behavioral
responses to social stimuli suggesting that these receptors could
also represent a functionally-relevant synaptic signature respon-
sible for the behavioral responses associated with other salient
stimuli.
Changes in AMPA/NMDA ratio occur in response to both
rewarding and aversive processes50, and synaptic strengthening is
transiently expressed and necessary for associative learning15.
Consistent with previous findings16, we report an increased
AMPA/NMDA ratio at VTA DA neuron excitatory inputs in
response to social interaction, which is transiently expressed upon
repeated exposure to nonfamiliar conspecifics, but not object
stimuli. However, although the increased synaptic strength might
represent an additional signature related to the saliency of social
interaction, its role in habituation processing and, possibly con-
textual learning, warrants further investigation.
In recent years, accumulating evidences indicate that synaptic
adaptations
associated
to
reward
and
aversion
occur
at
projection-specific subclasses of VTA DA neurons51,52. An
anatomic-functional segregation of reward circuitry is also
emerging in respect of social behavior: while VTA DA neurons
projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), but not prefrontal
cortex (PFC), promote conspecific interaction13, DA neuron
projections to the interpenduncular nucleus control familiarity
signaling47. Thus, the specific synaptic signatures observed in
response to nonfamiliar conspecific exposure might also occur in
dedicated VTA circuits. At the same time, given the intrinsic
diversity of sensory and emotional information provided by social
vs. inanimate stimuli, it is conceivable that synaptic plasticity
occurs at specific inputs to defined subclasses of VTA DA neu-
rons. Additional investigations of synaptic properties of defined
inputs to projection-specific DA neuron subclasses is needed to
further understand the circuits and the synaptic mechanisms

 underlying both novelty and saliency processing associated with
conspecific and inanimate stimuli.
Altered social interactions and communication are defining
aspects of the autism phenotype. However, such alterations may
arise from a plethora of neuronal processing defects, ranging
from alterations in perception, sensory processing, multisensory
integration, or positive and negative valence assigned to con-
specific stimuli23. In this work, we specifically explore neuronal
circuitry relevant for the exploration to and the preference for
nonfamiliar conspecifics. We chose this domain, as studies in
children
with
ASD
demonstrated
altered
habituation
and
responses to novel stimuli7,53. Notably, in toddlers, a slowed
habituation to faces but normal habituation to repeatedly viewed
objects has been reported to coincide with more severe ASD
symptoms54. Several rodent models of ASD exhibit altered social
novelty responses24,55, and such alterations have been suggested
to reflect changes in social memory or discrimination. However,

 habituation and social novelty responses in mice and humans are
largely unknown. Our rodent work not only highlights a con-
tribution of VTA DA neurons to this process but also takes steps
toward identification of the synaptic basis of social novelty
responses and habituation. Considering the complexity of ASD
behavioral dysfunctions, we propose that fractionating the autism
phenotype according to specific behavioral domains based on
neuronal circuit elements will provide a productive stratification
criterion for patient populations. Thus, we speculate that in a
subpopulation of individuals with ASD alterations in VTA DA
function might contribute to the social interaction phenotype
whereas in other subgroups of patients alterations in social
interaction may arise for different reasons. A prediction from this
hypothesis is that stratification of patient populations based on an
assessment of novelty responses, habituation, and social reward
may help to identify subgroups of patients that would particularly
benefit from interventions targeting function and plasticity of the
VTA-DA circuit elements.
Methods
Animals. The study was conducted with WT and transgenic mice in C57BL/6J
background. WT mice were obtained from Charles River. For DA neuron-specific
manipulations DAT-iresCre (Slc6a3tm1.1(cre)Bkmn)56 and DAT-Cre BAC transgenic
mice57 were employed. Nlgn3KO mice were previously described37. Male and
female mice were housed in groups (weaning at P21 – P23) under a 12 h light –
dark cycle (7:00 a.m.–7:00 p.m.). All physiology and behavior experiments were
performed during the light cycle. For Nlgn3KO and WT mice, multiple behavioral
tests were performed with the same group of animals, with a minimum of 3 days
in-between tests. VTA::DANL3KD and VTA::GFP participated in one behavioral test
prior to the start of social CPP. A minimum of two independent cohorts were used
for the behavioral experiments. Embryos for cortical cultures were obtained from
NMRI mice (Janvier). All the procedures performed at UNIGE and Biozentrum
complied with the Swiss National Institutional Guidelines on Animal Experi-
mentation and were approved by the respective Swiss Cantonal Veterinary Office
Committees for Animal Experimentation.
Surgery. Injections of rAAV5-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry and rAAV5-hSyn-
DIO-mCherry were performed in DAT-Cre mice at 4–7 weeks. For additional
information on chemogenetic viral vectors, see Supplementary Methods. Mice were
anesthetized with a mixture of oxygen (1 L/min) and isoflurane 3% (Baxter AG,
Vienna, Austria) and placed in a stereotactic frame (Angle One; Leica, Germany).
The skin was shaved, locally anesthetized with 40–50 µL lidocaine 0.5% and dis-
infected. Bilateral craniotomy (1 mm in diameter) was then performed over the
VTA at following stereotactic coordinates: ML ± 0.5 mm, AP −3.2 mm, DV −4.20
± 0.05 mm from Bregma. The virus was injected via a glass micropipette (Drum-
mond Scientific Company, Broomall, PA) into the VTA at the rate of 100 nl/min
for a total volume of 200 nL in each side. The virus was incubated for 3–8 weeks
prior to perform the behavioral tasks or electrophysiological recordings.
Injections of purified AAV2-DIO-miRNlgn3-GFP, AAV2-Synaptophysin-GFP
and AAV2-DIO-miR-GFP were done at P5–P6 for developmental knockdown and
at 4–7 weeks for adult knockdown. For additional information on viral vectors and
validation of construct for Neuroligin 3 downregulation, see Supplementary
Methods. Injections were performed under a mixture of oxygen and isoflurane
anesthesia (Baxter AG, Vienna, Austria) as previously described. The animals were
placed in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instrument) and a single craniotomy was made
over the VTA at the following stereotaxic coordinates: ML + 0.15 mm, AP + 0.2
mm, DV −4.2 mm from lambda for P5-P6, and for 4–7 weeks: ML ± 0.4 mm, AP
-3.2 mm, DV −4.4 mm from Bregma. Injections were made with a 33-G Hamilton
needle (Hamilton, 65460-02) for a total volume of 200 nL. Injections sites were
confirmed post hoc by immunostaining on VTA. The virus was incubated for
3–4 weeks prior to perform the behavioral tasks or immunostaining. Mice were
excluded from the study if the body weight was less than 75% of the mean body
weight at the start of behavior trials.
Injections of rAAV5-Ef1α-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP and rAAV5-Ef1α-DIO-
eYFP were performed in DAT-Cre mice at 4–5 weeks. For additional information
on viral vectors, see Supplementary Methods. Mice were anesthetized and placed in
a stereotactic frame (Angle One; Leica, Germany) as previously described. The skin
was shaved, locally anesthetized with 40–50 µL of lidocaine 0.5% and disinfected.
Unilateral craniotomy (1 mm in diameter) was then performed to reach the VTA
with a 10° angle, at following stereotactic coordinates: ML ± 0.9 mm, AP −3.2 mm,
DV −4.20 ± 0.05 mm from Bregma (Paxinos). The virus was injected via a glass
micropipette (Drummond Scientific Company, Broomall, PA) into the VTA at the
rate of 100 nl/min for a total volume of 500 nL. The virus was incubated for
3–4 weeks and subsequently, mice were implanted with optic fibers above the VTA.
The animals were anesthetized, placed in a stereotactic frame, the skin was shaved
and a unilateral craniotomy was performed as previously described. The optic fiber
was implanted with a 10° angle at the following coordinates: ML ± 0.9 mm, AP
−3.2 mm, DV −3.95 ± 0.05 mm from Bregma above the VTA and fixed to the skull
with dental acrylic.
Implantations of stainless steel 26-gauge cannula (PlasticsOne, Virginia, USA)
were performed on WT mice at 8–10 weeks. Mice were anesthetized and placed in
a stereotactic frame as previously described. Unilateral craniotomy (1 mm in
diameter) was then performed over the VTA at following stereotactic coordinates:
ML ± 0.9 mm, AP −3.2 mm, DV −3.95 ± 0.05 mm from Bregma. The cannula was
implanted with a 10° angle, placed above the VTA and fixed on the skull with

All animals underwent behavioral experiments 1–2 weeks after surgery.
Three-chamber test. The three-chambered social preference test was performed in
a rectangular Plexiglas arena (60 × 40 × 22 cm) (Ugo Basile, Varese, Italy) divided
into three chambers (each 20 × 40 × 22 cm) that communicate by removable doors
situated on the walls of the center chamber. Three to eight weeks after virus
infusions, VTA::DAhM4Di and VTA::DAmCherry mice were randomly assigned to
two batches that received intraperitoneal injections of either saline (vehicle) or
Clozapine N-oxide (5 mg kg−1; for further details about drug preparation and
injection see Supplementary Methods). All injections were done 30 min before
starting the experiment. One to two weeks after, the experimental subjects treated
first with CNO received vehicle and vice versa, thus performing the task in both
conditions. The habituation phase consisted in 10 min of free exploration of the
empty arena. Subsequently, the mouse was temporarily kept in the center chamber
by closing the removable doors. Two enclosures were placed in the centers of the
side chambers. One enclosure was left empty (inanimate object, o1) and the other
one contained a nonfamiliar social stimulus (novel juvenile mice C57BL/6J,
3–4 weeks, s1/s3 in vehicle or CNO condition). The doors were then removed and
the experimental mouse freely explored the arena and the two enclosures for 10
min. The walls of the enclosures, consisting of vertical metal bars, allowed visual,
auditory, olfactory and tactile contact between the experimental mouse and the
stimulus mouse. The stimuli mice were habituated to the enclosures during three
sessions of 20 min the 3 days before the experiment. The position of the stimuli was
randomly assigned and counterbalanced.
The mice were then restrained a second time in the center chamber by closing
the removable doors. The enclosures were held in position and a nonfamiliar
conspecific (s2/s4 in vehicle or CNO condition) was placed in the empty one. In
this phase, the prior nonfamiliar conspecific is considered as familiar (social
familiar, s1/s3). The doors were opened and the experimental mouse explored the
arena for 10 min, with the two enclosures containing the familiar and the
nonfamiliar social stimuli. At the end of the 10 min, the experimental and stimuli
mice returned to their home cage.
Every session was video-tracked and recorded using Ethovision XT (Noldus,
Wageningen, the Netherlands), which provided the time in the different chambers
and the distance moved during the test. An experimenter blind to the treatment of
animals also manually scored behavior. The stimulus interaction was scored when
the nose of the experimental subject was oriented toward the enclosures at a
distance approximately less than 2 cm. The time interaction was used to calculate
the Social Novelty Index as: Interactionnonfamiliar−Interactionfamiliar. The arena was
cleaned with 5% ethanol solution and dried between trials.
Long-term habituation/nonfamiliar exploration task. An experimental cage
similar to the animal’s home cage was used for this task. The bedding was replaced
after each trial and water and food were available. During the habituation phase
(4 days, day 1–4), all VTA::DAhM4Di experimental mice received an intraperitoneal
injection of saline 30 min before the task. The experimental VTA::DAhM4Di mouse
was placed in the cage with a nonfamiliar conspecific (novel juvenile mouse, C57Bl/
6J, 3–4 weeks old, s1). The animals were let free to explore the cage and to interact
with each other for 15 min. At the end of the trial, the experimental and stimulus
mice were returned to their homecage. For four consecutive days the experimental
mouse was exposed to the same conspecific (s1) and habituated to the environment
and the social stimulus. Day 5 consisted in the novelty phase. The VTA::DAhM4Di
experimental mice were split in two batches and were injected with either saline or
CNO (5 mg kg−1) 30 min before the trial. A nonfamiliar conspecific (s2) was placed
with the experimental mouse in the cage for 15 min to allow direct interaction. In
total, the experimental mice were exposed to two different conspecifics: one social
stimulus repeatedly presented from day 1–4 (habituation phase, s1) and a second
mouse at day 5 (novelty phase, s2) The same protocol as described above was used
for object habituation/nonfamiliar exploration task. The VTA::DAhM4Di experi-
mental mice received injection of saline and were exposed to the same object (der
klein kaufman tanner; Germany, o1) from day 1–4 (habituation phase). On day 5
the animals were injected with either saline or CNO (5 mg kg−1), and were exposed
to a novel object stimulus (novelty phase, o2). VTA::DAmCherry mice underwent
the habituation/nonfamiliar exploration task and received an intraperitoneal
injection of saline from day 1–4 and CNO (5 mg kg−1) on day 5. The social and
object habituation/nonfamiliar exploration task performed with Nlgn3KO and
VTA::DANL3KD was performed as described above. The test was done in a cage
similar to the mice home cage containing food and water; the same cage was used
for the duration of the trial. Three to four weeks old C57Bl/6J male mice were used
as stimulus mice, lego blocks and a small plastic toy were used as object. The
animals were left to freely interact with the stimulus mouse or object for 15 min.
For four consecutive days the experimental mouse was exposed to the same sti-
mulus (s1 or o1). Day 5 consisted of the novelty phase (s2 or o2). At the end of
each trial, the experimental and stimulus mice were returned to their home cage.
During the social habituation/nonfamiliar exploration task, nonaggressive
interaction was scored (experimenter blind to genotype and treatment group) when
the experimental mouse initiated the action and when the nose of the animal was
oriented toward the social stimulus mouse only. During the object habituation/
nonfamiliar exploration task, the interaction was scored when the nose of the
animal was oriented toward the object stimulus. The time interaction was used to
calculate the Novelty Index as: InteractionDay 5−InteractionDay 4, both for social
and object habituation/nonfamiliar exploration task.
The experimental cage was cleaned with 5% ethanol solution and the bedding
was changed between sessions.
For the experiments with pharmacological agents, mice were cannulated to
allow the infusion of either saline or 1-Naphthylacetyl spermine trihydrochloride
(NASPM), directly in the VTA. The habituation task was performed as previously
described. NASPM or saline were infused using a Minipump injector (pump Elite
11, Harvard apparatus, US) with 500 nL of saline (2 min of active injection at 250
nL min−1 rate, and 1 min at rest), 10 min before each trial. At day 1, mice received
saline. From day 2–4 of the habituation phase, mice received either 4 µg of NASPM
dissolved in 500 nL of saline or 500 nL of saline only (at 250 nL min−1) before each
trial. This dose has been previously used to obtain GluA2-lacking AMPARs block
in vivo58. After at least 1 week, the animals were re-tested to habituation/
nonfamiliar exploration task and the pharmacological treatment was
counterbalanced. The scoring of the social or object interaction was made as
previously described. The experimental cage was cleaned with 5% ethanol solution
and the bedding was changed after every session. To assess the cannula placement,
experimental subjects were infused using Chicago Sky Blue 6B (1 mg mL−1),
sacrificed 1–2 h later and transcardially perfused as previously described. For
detailed experimental procedures about NASPM infusions during open field and
familiar conspecific interaction and VTA DA neuron optogenetic stimulation

Methods.
Nonfamiliar, familiar, and novel object CPP. Conditioned place preference
experiments for examining reinforcing properties of nonfamiliar conspecific,
familiar conspecific or nonfamiliar object interactions were conducted in an
apparatus (spatial place preference; BioSEB) consisting of two adjacent chambers
(20 × 20 × 25 cm) with dot (black) or stripe (gray) wall patterns, connected by a
lateral corridor (7 × 20 × 25 cm) with transparent walls and floor. The dot chamber
was always associated to rough floor, while the stripe chamber with smooth floor.
The illumination level was uniform between the two chambers and set at 10–13 lux.
ANY-Maze behavior tracking software was used to track animal’s movements
within the apparatus and to manually score the time spent in nonaggressive
interaction with the stimulus.
At day 0, experimental mice (male C57Bl6/J; group-housed; 8–16 weeks) freely
explored the CPP apparatus for 15 min to determine Pre-TEST preference for one
or the other chamber. After the Pre-TEST, experimental mice returned to their
home cage with their cage-mates. The preference score was calculated as time spent
in stimulus chamber (US+) divided by the sum of the time spent in stimulus
chamber (US+) and the time spent in the empty chamber. No animals were
excluded from the analysis based on preference score and US+ pairings were
randomly assigned to dot or stripe chamber. At day 0, nonfamiliar conspecific
(male C57Bl/6J; single-housed; 3–4 weeks) or familiar stimuli mice (male C57Bl/6J;
cohoused with experimental mice during the conditioning) were habituated to the
US+ chamber for 15–30 min. The novel object stimulus was the same used in the
object habituation/nonfamiliar exploration task.
From day 1–4, experimental mice underwent a conditioning schedule consisting
of 30 min-long sessions (1 per day). Each session was subdivided in six blocks of 5
min during which the animals alternated between US+ and US− chamber, in
presence (of either familiar mouse, f1, nonfamiliar mouse, s1 or novel object, o1) or
absence (empty) of the stimulus, respectively. Experimental mice were guided
through the corridor during the alternations and returned to their home cage with
their cage-mates at the end of the conditioning session. Groups were
counterbalanced for US+/US− sequences and for dot or stripe wall pattern. VTA::
DAhM4Di and VTA::DAmCherry mice received an intraperitoneal injection of CNO
(5 mg kg−1) 30–90 min prior each conditioning session. At day 5, during the Post-
TEST, experimental mice freely explored the CPP apparatus, without any stimulus
for 15 min and the preference score was measured. The CPP apparatus was cleaned
with 1% acetic acid, rinsed with distilled water and dried between each
experimental subject.
Social conditioned place preference. Mice were tested at P30–P45 and were
group housed before the test. The test apparatus was a custom-built cage measuring
46 × 24 × 22 cm divided into three chambers. The two outer chambers (23 × 18 ×
22 cm) had vertical or horizontal striped pattern on the walls and flooring con-
sisting or black rubber mats with different patterns (stripes vs squares). The outer
chambers were joined together by a smaller chamber (23 × 10 cm) with white walls
and floor with a 7 × 7 cm opening at the base to the outer chambers that can be
closed. The cage was cleaned with 70% ethanol between each trial. During the
pretrial, mice were left to freely explore the cage for 30 min. After the pretrial, all
mice were single housed for the remainder of the test and one chamber was
assigned the social chamber and one the isolation chamber. All mice received one
social and one isolation condition session (30 min each) per day for 4 days, with a
two-day rest between the second and third conditioning day. Mice were socially
conditioned for 30 min together with their cage-mates followed by conditioning in
the isolation chamber for 30 min. After the fourth conditioning day, mice were
tested in a 30 min postconditioning trial. The time spent freely exploring the

 chambers for 30 min was manually scored by an investigator blinded to the gen-
otype. The preference score was calculated as the time spent in the social chamber
divided by the combined time spent in the social and isolation chamber. Animals
were excluded by pre-established criteria if they exhibited a strong preference for
one chamber (more than 2 reference for one chamber). For detailed description of
additional behavioral tasks, see Supplementary Methods.
Ex vivo electrophysiology. In all, 200–250 µM thick horizontal midbrain slices
were prepared from adolescence/early adulthood C57Bl/6J, VTA::DAhM4Di, VTA::
DAmCherry, Nlgn3 KO and VTA::DANL3KD mice. Subjects were anesthetized with
isoflurane/O2 and decapitated. Brains were sliced by using a cutting solution
containing: 90.89 mM choline chloride, 24.98 mM glucose, 25 mM NaHCO3, 6.98
mM MgCl2, 11.85 mM ascorbic acid, 3.09 mM sodium pyruvate, 2.49 mM KCl,
1.25 mM NaH2PO4, and 0.50 mM CaCl2. Brain slices were incubated in cutting
solution for 20–30 min at 35°. Subsequently, slices were transferred in artificial
cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing: 119 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.3 mM MgCl2,
2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.0 mM NaH2PO4, 26.2 mM NaHCO3, and 11 mM glucose, bubbled
with 95% O2 and 5% CO2) at room temperature. Whole-cell voltage clamp or
current clamp electrophysiological recordings were conducted at 32°–34° in aCSF
(2–3 ml/min, submerged slices). Recording pipette contained the following internal
solution: 130 mM CsCl, 4 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1.1 mM EGTA, 5 mM HEPES,
2 mM Na2ATP, 5 mM sodium creatine phosphate, 0.6 mM Na3GTP, 0.1 mM
spermine and 5 mM lidocaine N-ethyl bromide. Ex vivo CNO validation experi-
ments were conducted in current-clamp configuration with the following internal
solution: 140 mM K-Gluconate, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EGTA, 10 mM
HEPES, 4 mM Na2ATP, 0.3 mM Na3GTP and 10 mM creatine-phosphate. Putative
DA neurons of the VTA were identified accordingly to their position (medially to
the medial terminal nucleus of the accessory optic tract), morphology, cell capa-
citance (>28 pF) and low input resistance at positive potentials. Excitatory post-
synaptic currents (EPSCs) were recorded in voltage-clamp configuration, elicited
by placing a bipolar electrode rostrolaterally to VTA at 0.1 Hz and isolated by
application of the GABAAR antagonist picrotoxin (100 µM). Traces were not
corrected. Access resistance (10–30 MΩ) was monitored by a hyperpolarizing step
of −4 mV at each sweep, every 10 s. Data were excluded when the resistance
changed >20%. The AMPA/NMDA ratio was calculated by subtracting to the
mixed EPSC (+35 mV), the non-NMDA component isolated by D-APV (50 µM at
+35 mV) bath application. The values of the ratio may be underestimated since it
was calculated with spermine in the pipette. The rectification index (RI) of
AMPARs is the ratio of the chord conductance calculated at negative potential
(–60 mV) divided by the chord conductance at positive potential (+40 mV). PPR
was measured at −60 mV, with a fixed inter stimulation interval of 50 ms. PPR was
calculated by dividing the amplitude of the second EPSC by the amplitude of the
first EPSC. To measure the RI from ChR2-expressing VTA DA neurons after
in vivo optogenetic stimulation, a 500 ms blue-light pulse was delivered through
the microscope objective in voltage-clamp configuration. Neurons were considered
photocurrent positive (IChR2+) when they responded with a large depolarizing
current in response to optical stimulation, while photocurrent negative (IChR2−)
when they did not. Representative example traces are shown as the average of
10–20 consecutives EPSCs typically obtained at each potential. The synaptic
responses were collected with a Multiclamp 700B-amplifier (Axon Instruments,
Foster City, CA), filtered at 2.2 kHz, digitized at 5 Hz, and analyzed online using
Igor Pro software (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Electrophysiology experi-
ments were performed blind to behavioral or genetic manipulation.
Statistical analysis. No statistical methods were used to predetermine the number
of animals and cells, but suitable sample sizes were estimated based on previous
experience and are similar to those generally employed in the field. The animals
were randomly assigned to each group at the moment of viral infections or
behavioral tests. Statistical analysis was conducted with GraphPad Prism 6 and 7
(San Diego, CA, USA) and MatLab (The Mathwork). Statistical outliers were
identified with the ROUT method (Q = 1) and excluded from the analysis. The
normality of sample distributions was assessed with the Shapiro–Wilk criterion and
when violated nonparametrical tests were used. When normally distributed, the
data were analyzed with independent t test, paired t test, while for multiple
comparisons one-way ANOVA and repeated measures (RM) ANOVA were used.
When normality was violated, the data were analyzed with Mann–Whitney test,
Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, while for multiple comparisons,
Kruskal–Wallis or Friedman test were followed by Dunn’s test. For the analysis of
variance with two factors (two-way ANOVA, RM two-way ANOVA and RM two-
way ANOVA by both factors), normality of sample distribution was assumed, and
followed by Bonferroni post hoc test. All the statistical tests adopted were two-
sided. When comparing two samples distributions similarity of variances was
assumed, therefore no corrections were adopted. For social behavior experiments,
the outlier analysis was conducted on manually scored nonaggressive social
interaction. Data are represented as the mean ± s.e.m. and the significance was set
at P < 0.05. For further information about the statistical analysis of the three-
chamber social interaction task and a summary of the statistical tests adopted for
each dataset, see Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 1.
