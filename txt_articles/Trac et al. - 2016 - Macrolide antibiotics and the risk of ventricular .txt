acrolide antibiotics (e.g., azithromycin, 
clarithromycin and erythromycin) are a 
common class of medication used to 
treat community-acquired respiratory tract infec-
tions.1–3 In 2010, more than 57 million outpatient 
prescriptions were written for macrolide antibiotics 
in the United States.4 An observational study 
prompted the US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) to issue warnings about the risk of QT inter-
val prolongation and fatal ventricular arrhythmia 
with azithromycin.5 This study showed a higher 
risk of cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality 
among patients prescribed azithromycin than 
among patients prescribed amoxicillin or no anti-
biotic.6 Findings from this study were supported by 
case reports and other published studies.7–12 Other 
frequently used macrolide antibiotics, such as clar-
ithromycin and erythromycin, have also been asso-
ciated with QT interval prolongation.11,13,14
Recent studies suggest that these regulatory 
warnings are overstated.15–18 Mortensen and col-
leagues15 showed the risk of 90-day mortality was 
no higher (and rather was lower) among older 
patients who received azithromycin than among 
those who received other guideline-concordant anti-
biotics. In the same study, there was no difference 
between the 2 groups in the risk of arrhythmia, 
heart failure or any cardiac event.15 Another study 
showed no higher 5-day risk of cardiovascular 
death with azithromycin than with penicillin V.16 In 
a study involving patients with radiologically con-
firmed community-acquired pneumonia, compared 
with nonuse, clarithromycin was associated with a 
higher risk of cardiovascular events, but not cardio-
vascular mortality or all-cause mortality.17
Given the conflicting findings of prior studies, 
we conducted a large propensity-matched popula-
tion-based cohort study involving older adults in 
the outpatient setting to investigate whether azithro-
mycin, clarithromycin or erythromycin was associ-
ated with a higher 30-day risk of ventricular 
arrhythmia than nonmacrolide antibiotics (amoxi-
cillin, cefuroxime or levofloxacin). Based on prior 
literature, we hypothesized that macrolide antibiotic 
use would be associated with a higher risk of ven-
tricular arrhythmia than nonmacrolide antibiotics.

Background: Many respiratory tract infections 
are treated with macrolide antibiotics. Regu-
latory agencies warn that these antibiotics 
increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmia. We 
examined the 30-day risk of ventricular ar-
rhyth 
mia and all-cause mortality associated 
with macrolide antibiotics relative to nonmac-
rolide antibiotics.
Methods: We conducted a population-based 
retrospective cohort study involving older adults 
(age > 65 yr) with a new prescription for an oral 
macrolide antibiotic (azithromycin, clarithromy-
cin or erythromycin) in Ontario from 2002 to 
2013. Our primary outcome was a hospital 
encounter with ventricular arrhythmia within 
30 days after a new prescription. Our secondary 
outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. We 
matched patients 1:1 using propensity scores to 
patients prescribed nonmacrolide antibiotics 
(amoxicillin, cefuroxime or levofloxacin). We 
used conditional logistic regression to measure 
the association between macrolide exposure 
and outcomes, and repeated the analysis in 
4 subgroups defined by the presence or absence 
of chronic kidney disease, congestive heart fail-
ure, coronary artery disease and concurrent use 
of a drug known to prolong the QT interval.
Results: Compared with nonmacrolide antibiot-
ics, macrolide antibiotics were not associated 
with a higher risk of ventricular arrhythmia 
(0.03% v. 0.03%; relative risk [RR] 1.06, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 0.83–1.36) and were 
associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortal-
ity (0.62% v. 0.76%; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.78–0.86). 
These associations were similar in all subgroups.
Interpretation: Among older adults, macrolide 
antibiotics were not associated with a higher 
30-day risk of ventricular arrhythmia than 
nonmacrolide antibiotics. These findings sug-
gest that current warnings from the US Food 
and Drug Administration may be overstated.

Methods
Design and setting
We conducted a population-based retrospective 
cohort study involving older adults, using linked 
health care databases in the province of Ontario, 
from Apr. 1, 2002, to Mar. 1, 2013. Ontario has 
about 13.7 million residents, 16% of whom are 
aged 65 years and older.19 The Ontario Health 
Insurance Plan (OHIP) is the single payer for all 
Ontario citizens and provides universal access to 
hospital care and phys 
ician services. Residents 
aged 65 and older (about 2 million residents) also 
receive prescription drug coverage.
We conducted this study at the Institute for 
Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) according to 
a prespecified protocol that was approved by the 
Research Ethics Board at Sunnybrook Health 
Sciences Centre (Toronto, Ontario). Participant 
informed consent was not required for this study. 
The reporting of this study followed guidelines 
for observational studies (Appendix 1, available 
at www 
.cmaj 
.ca 
/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj.150901/-/DC1).20
Data sources
We ascertained patient characteristics, drug use, 
covariate information and outcome data using 
records from 8 databases. Vital statistics, includ-
ing date of death, were obtained from the Regis-
tered Persons Database, which contains demo-
graphic information on all Ontario residents 
who have ever been issued a health card. We 
used the Ontario Drug Benefit Program database 
to identify prescription drug use. This database 
contains highly accurate records of all outpatient 
prescriptions dispensed to patients aged 65 and 
older, with an error rate of less than 1%.21 We 
identified diagnostic and procedural information 
on all hospital admissions and emergency de-
partment visits from the Canadian Institute for 
Health Information (CIHI) Discharge Abstract 
Database and CIHI National Ambulatory Care 
Reporting System database. Covariate informa-
tion was obtained from the OHIP database, 
which includes health claims for inpatient and 
outpatient physician services. The Canadian 
Organ Replacement Register identifies patients 
with end-stage kidney disease. Diagnostic infor-
mation on all admissions to adult mental health 
beds was determined using the Ontario Mental 
Health Reporting System. The ICES Physician 
Database reports prescriber and specialist refer-
ral data. These data sets were linked with the 
use of unique, encoded identifiers and analyzed 
at ICES. Previous studies have used these data-
bases to study adverse drug events and health 
outcomes.22–30
With the exception of prescriber specialty 
(missing in 19% of prescriptions), the databases 
were complete for all variables used in this study.
Codes from the International Classification of 
Diseases, 9th revision (ICD-9; pre-2002) and the 
International Statistical Classification of Diseases 
and Related Health Problems, 10th revision 
(ICD-10; post-2002) were used to assess baseline 
comorbidities in the 5 years before receipt of the 
new antibiotic prescription (Appendix 2, avail-
able at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj.150901/-/DC1). Concurrent medication use 
was assessed in the 120 days before cohort entry. 
Chest radiography, urinalysis and sputum tests 
were assessed in the 7 days before cohort entry. 
We evaluated prior health care use with physician 
visits, and diagnostic and screening tests per-
formed in the previous year. Codes used to ascer-
tain outcomes are detailed in Appendix 3, avail-
able at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj 
.150901/-/DC1, which lists only ICD-10 
codes because all events occurred after the imple-
mentation of this coding system.
Patients
We established a cohort of older adults in Ontario 
who were dispensed a new outpatient prescription 
for a macrolide antibiotic (azithromycin, clarithro-
mycin or erythromycin) between Apr. 1, 2002, and 
Mar. 1, 2013. The date of the prescription served as 
the index date (referred to as the cohort entry date 
or start time for follow-up). These patients were 
compared with a group of older adults with similar 
baseline indicators of health who were prescribed 
nonmacrolide antibiotics that have similar indica-
tions for use as macrolide antibiotics but have not 
been found to be associated with ventricular 
arrhythmia (amoxicillin or cefuroxime) or have 
weak proarrhythmic potential (levofloxacin).14
Before matching, we excluded the following 
patients from both groups: those who were in their 
first year of eligibility for prescription drug cover-
age (age 65 yr), to avoid incomplete medication 
records; those with prescriptions for any antibiotic 
in the 180 days before the index date, to ensure that 
the drug was newly prescribed; those who received 
a prescription for more than 1 type of antibiotic on 
the index date, to form mutually exclusive groups; 
those who were discharged from the hospital in the 
2 days before their index date, to ensure these were 
new outpatient antibiotic prescriptions (because in 
Ontario, patients continuing an antibiotic treatment 
initiated in the hospital would have their outpatient 
antibiotic prescription dispensed on the same day 
or the day after hospital discharge); and those with 
daily drug doses that were not standard for the 
treatment of respiratory tract infections, to ensure 
generalizability to usual prescribing (Appendix 4, 
 Research
E122 
CMAJ, April 19, 2016, 188(7) 
available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi: 
10.1503/cmaj. 
150901/-/DC1). Study patients could 
enter the cohort only once, so for patients with mul-
tiple eligible prescriptions, we restricted the infor-
mation to the first eligible prescription.
Outcomes
The primary outcome of this study was a hospital 
encounter (presentation to the emergency depart-
ment or hospital admission) with ventricular 
arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia or ventricular 
fibrillation). The secondary outcome was all-cause 
mortality. We restricted our analysis to 30 days 
after the index date because macrolide antibiotics 
are prescribed for short durations and any observed 
outcomes can be reasonably attributed to the study 
drugs over this time frame. Furthermore, QT pro-
longation has been shown to start within hours to 
days of initiating macrolides, and thus, one would 
expect that drug-related ventricular arrhythmias 
would occur soon after initiating a macrolide anti-
biotic prescription.11,12,31–33 We conducted a second-
ary analysis using a 14-day (v. 30-d) follow-up.
The diagnosis codes used to identify ventricular 
arrhythmia are presented in Appendix 3. Trained 
personnel enter these codes into the databases 
based only on physician-recorded diagnoses in a 
patient’s medical chart. The ICD-10 codes for ven-
tricular arrhythmia have not been fully validated; 
however, their sensitivity would be expected to be 
low, since true ventricular arrhythmias frequently 
go undetected in routine health care (because they 
often occur outside hospital settings, in unmoni-
tored patients in hospital or in a setting of multi-
organ medical illness). In previous studies assess-
ing the accuracy of ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes for 
cardiac arrhythmia (ventricular and supraventricu-
lar), the positive predictive value (truly have the 
condition when code is present) exceeded 80%.34–37 
We performed a manual review of 202 charts in 
our region and confirmed a positive predictive 
value of 92% (95% confidence interval [CI] 87%–
95%) for the set of codes used in this study to 
detect ventricular arrhythmia. Vital statistics for all-
cause mortality are coded accurately in our data 
sources, with a sensitivity of 97.8% and specificity 
of 100% for the finding of death.38 Because codes 
to assess specific cause of death in our region have 
not been validated and are expected to be inaccu-
rate, we did not include this outcome in our study.
Statistical analysis
We used propensity score matching to eliminate 
systematic differences in the measured baseline 
characteristics of our comparison groups. This 
allowed us to form a matched set of patients in our 
2 groups with a similar probability of receiving a 
macrolide antibiotic given a set of measured base-
line covariates.39,40 We estimated the propensity 
scores using a multivariable logistic regression 
model with 106 baseline characteristics selected 
because of their potential influence on the out-
comes or segregation of patients between the com-
parison groups (Appendix 5, available at www.
cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.150901/-/
DC1).40–42 We matched patients in the macrolide 
antibiotic group with patients in the nonmacrolide 
antibiotic group in a 1:1 ratio using greedy match-
ing with a caliper width within 0.2 standard devia-
tions of the logit of the propensity score. We also 
matched patients based on presence or absence of 
the following 4 conditions to conduct prespecified 
subgroup analyses for the matched pairs: chronic 
kidney disease, congestive heart failure, coronary 
artery disease and concurrent use of a drug known 
to prolong the QT interval (Appendix 6, available 
at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj.150901 
/-/DC1). We compared baseline char-
acteristics between those prescribed macrolide 
antibiotics and those prescribed nonmacrolide anti-
biotics using standardized differences. This metric 
describes differences between group means rela-
tive to the pooled standard deviation and is consid-
ered a meaningful difference if greater than 10%.43 
We estimated the odds ratio (OR) and 95% CIs for 
the primary and secondary outcomes using condi-
tional logistic regression, which accounted for 
matching.44 Each OR was approximated to be the 
relative risk (RR) (appropriate given the inci-
dences observed). We also performed multivari-
able logistic regression with the unmatched cohort, 
adjusting for age, sex and the 4 subgroup condi-
tions defined above.
We evaluated the association between mac-
rolide antibiotic use and our outcomes in 
4 specified subgroups within our propensity-
matched cohort, as defined above. We hypothe-
sized that any RR of ventricular arrhythmia 
associated with macrolide antibiotics compared 
with nonmacrolide antibiotics might be greater 
when these conditions were present than when 
they were absent. For example, the dose of clar-
ithromycin should be reduced by 50% in chronic 
kidney disease owing to impaired clearance, but 
in practice this seldom occurs.45 Similarly, in 
prior reports, ventricular arrhythmia associated 
with macrolide antibiotic use occurred in 
patients with pre-existing risk factors, such as 
congestive heart failure46 and cardiovascular 
disease,11,47–49 and those taking other QT-
prolonging medications.50,51 We also assessed 
interaction by type of macrolide antibiotic, in 
which patients taking nonmacrolide antibiotics 
followed their matched pair. We determined 
interaction p values by including interaction 
terms in the regression models. In addition,

because levofloxacin has been associated with 
weak proarrhythmic potential, we repeated our 
analyses excluding matched pairs that included 
levofloxacin, to determine whether this affected 
the risk for ventricular arrhythmia associated 
with macrolide antibiotics compared with non-
macrolide antibiotics. We conducted all analyses 
with SAS version 9.4. In all outcome analyses, 
we interpreted 2-tailed p values less than 0.05 
as significant.

Before matching, patients prescribed macro-
lide antibiotics were more likely to receive their 
prescription from a general practitioner (77.0% 
v. 56.6%) and have chronic lung disease (28.8% 
v. 23.8%) than patients prescribed nonmacrolide 
antibiotics, and were less likely to take warfarin 
(4.6% v. 7.4%) and have a urinalysis test (1.5% 
v. 4.9%). A total of 503 612 patients taking mac-
rolide antibiotics were successfully matched 
with 503 612 patients taking nonmacrolide anti-
biotics. The 2 groups were well-balanced and 
showed no meaningful differences in the 106 
measured baseline characteristics (Appendix 8). 
Clarithromycin and azithromycin were the most 
frequently prescribed macrolide antibiotics 
(48.9% and 48.0%, respectively), followed by 
erythromycin (3.1%). The median starting daily 
dose for clarithromycin was 1000 (interquartile 
range [IQR] 500–1000) mg; for azithromycin, 
300 (IQR 300–300) mg; and for erythromycin, 
1000 (IQR 999–1000) mg. The median day sup-
ply for clarithromycin was 10 (IQR 7–10) days; 
for azithromycin, 5 (IQR 5–5) days; and for 
erythromycin, 7 (IQR 7–10) days. General prac-
titioners were the most frequent prescribers 
(73% in both groups). The region of Ontario 
where the antibiotic was prescribed was also 
well-balanced among matched patients taking 
macrolide and nonmacrolide antibiotics. The 
interaction by macrolide type was not significant 
(p = 0.7), thus macrolides were examined as a 
group in all analyses.

multiorgan medical illness in which recorded codes describe illnesses other than ventricular arrhythmia).

Outcomes
The primary and secondary outcomes are shown 
in Table 2. Across the entire cohort, during the 
30-day follow-up period, 260 patients (0.03%) 
had a record of a hospital encounter with ventric-
ular arrhythmia and 6977 (0.69%) died.
The 30-day risk of ventricular arrhythmia 
associated with macrolide antibiotics compared 
with nonmacrolide antibiotics was not signifi-
cantly different (0.03% v. 0.03%; RR 1.06, 95% 
CI 0.83–1.36; p = 0.6). Use of macrolide antibiot-
ics was associated with a lower risk of all-cause 
mortality (0.62% v. 0.76%; RR 0.82, CI 0.78–
0.86; p < 0.001). Similar results were observed 
with use of multivariable logistic regression in 
our entire unmatched cohort (Appendix 9, avail-
able at www.cmaj 
.ca/lookup/suppl/doi: 
10.1503/
cmaj. 
150901/-/DC1). 
Subgroup analyses
Subgroup analyses for ventricular arrhythmia and 
all-cause mortality are shown in Figures 1 and 
2. The presence or absence of chronic kidney 
disease, congestive heart failure, coronary artery 
disease or concurrent use of a QT-prolonging 
drug did not significantly modify the relative asso-
ciation between antibiotic exposure and the risk of 
ventricular arrhythmia (p values for the interac-
tion ranged from 0.3 to 0.8). Across all subgroups, 
use of macrolide antibiotics was associated with a 
lower risk of all-cause mortality than use of non-
macrolide antibiotics, with no modification of the 
relative association across subgroups (p values for 
the interaction ranged from 0.1 to 0.7).
Additional analyses
First, we examined our outcomes at 14 days 
(rather than 30 d) of follow-up. Similar to our 
30-day follow-up analysis, macrolide antibiotic 
use was associated with no different risk in 
ventricular arrhythmia and a lower risk of all-
cause mortality than nonmacrolide antibiotic 
use (Appendix 10, available at www.cmaj.ca/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj. 
150901/-/DC1).
Second, when we repeated our analyses 
excluding matched pairs taking levofloxacin, the 
association with ventricular arrhythmia did not 
change (0.03% v. 0.02%; RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.92–
1.58; p = 0.2).
Interpretation
In this population-based cohort study, we observed 
that, compared with nonmacrolide antibiotics, new 
use of macrolide antibiotics was associated with a 
similar 30-day risk of ventricular arrhythmia 
(0.03% v. 0.03%) and a slightly lower risk of all-
cause mortality (0.62% v. 0.76%).
The findings of 9 published studies (summa-
rized in Appendix 11, available at www.cmaj.ca/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.150901/-/DC1) 
describing the risk of arrhythmia or death with use 
of macrolide antibiotics compared with other 
classes of antibiotics or nonuse are inconsistent.

These studies vary in patient age, sex and comor-
bidity. Two studies reported no significant increase 
in the risk of ventricular arrhythmia associated 
with macrolide use relative to other antibiotics af-
ter 107 and 3015 days of follow-up, although Rao 
and colleagues7 reported an increased risk during 
the first 5 days of treatment only. The 7 remaining 
studies did not examine arrhythmia risk; however, 
1 study did report a higher risk of cardiac events.17 
With respect to our secondary outcome of all-
cause mortality, 2 studies reported a higher risk as-
sociated with macrolide antibiotic use6,9 and 
3 other studies reported no such risk.15,17,18 Similar 
to our results, 2 studies reported macrolide antibi-
otics to be associated with a lower risk of all-cause 
mortality than nonmacrolide antibiotics.15,18 Rao 
and colleagues7 reported an increased risk of all-
cause mortality during the first 5 days of treatment, 
but not for treatment days 6 to 10. We used the 
quality checklist developed by Downs and Black55 
to assess the reporting, external validity, internal 
validity and statistical power of the prior 9 studies 
(Appendix 12, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/
suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.150901 
/-/DC1). Six of the 
reviewed studies were of fair quality,6–8,15,17,56 and 
3 were of good quality.9,16,18
Of particular interest is the comparison of our 
findings with those of Ray and colleagues,6 who 
observed a higher 5-day risk of cardiovascular 
death (hazard ratio [HR] 2.88, 95% CI 1.79–4.63) 
and death from any cause (HR 1.85, 95% CI 
1.25–2.75) among patients taking azithromycin 
compared with patients not taking an antibiotic, as 
well as among patients taking azithromycin com-
pared with those taking amoxicillin (HR 2.49, 
95% CI 1.38–4.50, for cardiovascular death; HR 
2.02, 95% CI 1.24–3.30, for all-cause mortality). 
Although the authors matched baseline character-
istics when they compared azithromycin use with 
nonuse, no matching was done when the reference 
group was use of amoxicillin. Compared with the 
azithromycin group, patients receiving amoxicil-
lin seemed healthier overall, with a lower propor-
tion of baseline medication use (with the excep-
tion of digoxin and insulin), a lower prevalence of 
comorbidities and fewer hospital admissions and 
emergency department visits. Accordingly, fewer 
deaths may have occurred among those receiving 
amoxicillin if they were less prone to events than 
the macrolide antibiotic group.
In this same study, the authors reported the 
greatest risk of cardiovascular death among 
patients with the highest baseline risk of cardio-
vascular disease.6 Additionally, Schembri and col-
leagues17 reported an increased risk of car-
diovascular events with prolonged courses of 
clarithromycin (> 7 d), especially in patients with 
pre-existing coronary artery disease. For these 
reasons, we explored congestive heart failure and 
coronary artery disease as subgroups in our study, 
in addition to chronic kidney disease and use of 
other QT-prolonging medications. In contrast to 
prior studies, we found that these variables did not 
significantly alter the association between macro-
lide antibiotic use and our outcomes. Nonetheless, 
these findings should be interpreted with caution, 
and physicians should always consider a patient’s 
baseline risk for adverse events before prescribing 
macrolides or other antibiotics.
Three recent reviews of case reports have iden-
tified several major risk factors for macrolide- 
induced QT prolongation: existing QT interval 
prolongation, a history of torsades de pointes, 
female sex, older age, heart disease, hypokalemia, 
hypomagnesemia, significant bradycardia, brady-
arrhythmias and use of QT-prolonging drugs and 
metabolic inhibitors.57–59 Progression of QT pro-
longation to more serious cardiac events com-
monly occurs when many of these clinical risk fac-
tors are present together. Older women with heart 
disease are at particularly higher risk.57 To mini-
mize risk, others advocate for electrocardiography 
to monitor the QT interval before and after initiat-
ing therapy.60 There has also been recent specula-
tion about the role of potential genetic modifiers in 
clarithromycin-related arrhythmia risk, and some 
believe genetic screening for potential drug-
induced QT prolongation may be of value.61
Strengths and limitations
Our study has several strengths. The use of Ontar-
io’s health care databases with data on universal 
prescription drug coverage for older adults pro-
vided us with a large representative sample of 
patients who received the study antibiotics in rou-
tine care. This allowed us to estimate the risks of 
uncommon but serious adverse events with good 
precision and external validity. We assessed clini-
cally important adverse events (hospital encounter 
with ventricular arrhythmia and death), rather than 
relying on surrogate outcomes such as a prolonged 
QT interval on an electrocardiogram, which makes 
these findings of particular interest to clinicians and 
regulatory agencies. In addition, we were able to 
reduce the influence of confounding by indication, 
a bias common to observational drug studies. Con-
founding by indication assumes that patients who 
receive a drug for a particular reason may have an 
altered risk of study outcomes because of this 
underlying reason compared with those who did 
not receive the drug.62 To reduce the influence of 
confounding by indication, we compared patients 
prescribed macrolide antibiotics with patients pre-
scribed nonmacrolide antibiotics (amoxicillin, 
cefuroxime or levofloxacin) that have similar indi-
cations (e.g., treatment of community-acquired 
 Research
E128 
CMAJ, April 19, 2016, 188(7) 
respiratory tract infections) as macrolide antibiotics 
but are not meaningfully associated with a higher 
risk of ventricular arrhythmia.
Our study has some limitations. Prospective 
data collection with independent outcome adjudi-
cation would be a preferred method to assess risk. 
In this study, we analyzed retrospective data using 
administrative diagnosis codes assigned from 
physician records, and cardiac rhythm tracings 
were not available in our data sources. The diag-
nosis codes we used for a hospital encounter with 
ventricular arrhythmia have a good positive pre-
dictive value but limited sensitivity. However, we 
have no reason to suspect any systematic differ-
ence in diagnosis recording by antibiotic type, 
which suggests that our relative measures of risk 
are robust. In addition, we were unable to deter-
mine the specific indication for which the antibiot-
ics were prescribed, because this information is 
not captured in our pharmacy database. However, 
we did know the specialty of the prescriber, which 
was similar in our 2 matched groups. As with all 
observational studies, residual confounding can 
never be eliminated; however, we used a statisti-
cal technique to ensure our comparison groups 
were similar on 106 measured baseline character-
istics. Our findings may not be generalizable to 
other regions if Ontario physicians deliberately 
avoided prescribing macrolide antibiotics to 
patients at highest risk of ventricular arrhythmia 
(e.g., those with baseline QT prolongation) or dis-
continued macrolide antibiotics when the QT 
interval was prolonged in a follow-up electrocar-
diogram. However, our impression is that most 
Ontario physicians rarely take ventricular arrhyth-
mia risk into account when deciding to prescribe a 
macrolide. Although shorter follow-up periods 
were used in prior studies,6–8,16,17,56 we consider the 
30-day follow-up used in our study to be clini-
cally relevant. We did, however, repeat our analy-
ses within 14 days of macrolide prescription and 
found similar results.
Implications for practice
This study was prompted by FDA warnings about 
a higher risk of QT interval prolongation and sub-
sequent ventricular arrhythmia among patients 
taking azithromycin.5 Although caution should be 
exercised when prescribing macrolide antibiotics 
to high-risk patients in whom drug clearance or 
electrical activity of the heart is impaired and out-
comes less predictable, our study findings and 
examination of the current literature suggest that 
the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and death from 
macrolide antibiotic use may be overstated. A 
careful re-examination and updating of drug pre-
scribing references45,63–65 and warnings from regu-
latory agencies may be warranted.
Conclusion
Among older adults prescribed macrolide antibi-
otics compared with nonmacrolide antibiotics, 
we found no difference in risk of a hospital 
encounter with ventricular arrhythmia within 30 
days of a new prescription and a lower risk of 
30-day all-cause mortality. These findings are 
reassuring for health care providers who pres-
cribe macrolide antibiotics to a wide range of 
patients in routine care.
