Abstract
Background—We investigated whether adolescents drank alcohol less frequently if they lived in 
jurisdictions with school climates that were more affirmative of lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) individuals.
Methods—Data from the 2010 School Health Profile survey, which measured LGBTQ school 
climate (e.g., percentage of schools with safe spaces and gay-straight alliances), were linked with 
pooled data from the 2005 and 2007 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, which measured sexual 
orientation identity, demographics, and alcohol use (number of drinking days, drinking days at 
school, and heavy episodic drinking days) in 8 jurisdictions. Two-level Poisson models tested the 
associations between school climate and alcohol use for each sexual-orientation subgroup.
Results—Living in jurisdictions with more (versus less) affirmative LGBTQ school climates was 
significantly associated with: fewer heavy episodic drinking days for gay/lesbian (incidence-rate

1. INTRODUCTION
Gay/lesbian and bisexual adolescents drink alcohol and engage in heavy episodic drinking 
(HED) more frequently than their heterosexual peers (Corliss et al., 2008; Marshal et al., 
2008; Talley et al., 2014). Stigma and minority stress theories (Goffman, 1963; Meyer, 
2003) purport that gay/lesbian and bisexual adolescents experience an excess burden of 
stress related to their minority sexual orientation, which can lead them to cope by drinking 
alcohol. Though empirical research supporting these theories have identified interpersonal 
mechanisms (e.g., violence; Jun et al., 2010; Rosario et al., 2014) that partly explain sexual-
orientation drinking disparities, the recent Institute of Medicine report on the health of gay/
lesbian and bisexual individuals called for more research on how broader social 
environments contribute to health disparities (Institute of Medicine, 2011). For example, 
school environments have a powerful influence on adolescents’ health (Bonell et al., 2013). 
In particular, school climates that are more (versus less) affirming of lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) adolescents may have fewer stressors—or foster 
healthy coping and resilience—for these populations, thereby mitigating sexual-orientation 
drinking disparities (Hatzenbuehler, 2009).
Studies have linked alcohol use with two aspects of LGBTQ school climate: the presence of 
gay-straight alliances (GSAs) and anti-bullying policies that enumerate sexual orientation as 
a protected demographic (Heck et al., 2011; Konishi et al., 2013; Poteat et al., 2013). 
Generally, GSAs are student clubs comprised of LGBTQ students and their heterosexual 
allies who work together to cultivate safe and supportive environments for students of all 
sexual orientations and gender identities/expressions. Studies examining the associations 
between GSAs and alcohol use generally show that all students—gay/lesbian, bisexual, and 
heterosexual students—attending schools with GSAs report lower drinking behaviors than 
students at schools without GSAs (Konishi et al., 2013; Poteat et al., 2013). One study 
(Konishi et al., 2013) showed that attending schools with anti-bullying policies that 
enumerate sexual orientation as a protected demographic was associated with lower odds of 
past-month HED for heterosexual, gay/lesbian, and bisexual students; however, some of 
these findings failed to reach statistical significance, despite having odds ratios of 0.50 and 
below. These studies suggest that GSAs and inclusive anti-bullying policies are associated 
with lower alcohol use for all students.

 LGBTQ-affirmative school climates also include other vital facets. LGBTQ adolescents who 
learn from LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum report feeling safer and experiencing less 
victimization (Kosciw et al., 2012, 2014). Because lower victimization is associated with 
lower alcohol use (Bontempo and d'Augelli, 2002; Rosario et al., 2014; Russell et al., 2012), 
school climates that reduce victimization likely lower adolescents’ alcohol use. Moreover, 
LGBTQ adolescents who see “safe space” stickers (which help LGBTQ people identify 
locations where they will be welcomed and affirmed) at school are more likely to feel 
comfortable and have positive/helpful conversations with teachers and mental health 
professionals about LGBTQ issues, even when controlling for presence of GSAs (Kosciw et 
al., 2012, 2014). Furthermore, gay/lesbian and bisexual adolescents who have supportive 
educators report greater feelings of safety, less victimization, and lower alcohol use than 
their peers without this kind of support (Goodenow et al., 2006; Kosciw et al., 2012, 2014; 
Seil et al., 2014). Altogether, this evidence suggests that teaching LGBTQ-inclusive 
curriculum, providing adolescents with safe spaces, offering counseling services, and 
fostering supportive student-teacher relationships may be linked with lower alcohol use.
Using an established measure of LGBTQ school climate that incorporates the 
abovementioned facets of the school environment (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2014), the current 
study examined the effects of LGBTQ school climate and sexual orientation on adolescents’ 
drinking frequency. Using representative data from 8 jurisdictions across the United States, 
we examined the independent effects of LGBTQ school climate and sexual orientation on 3 
alcohol use variables—number of past-month drinking days, drinking days at school, and 
HED days. We also tested whether sexual orientation modified the effects of LGBTQ school 
climate on alcohol use, and estimated the effects of LGBTQ-affirmative school climate on 
alcohol use for each sexual-orientation subgroup separately. Based on prior research (Corliss 
et al., 2008; Goodenow et al., 2006; Heck et al., 2011; Konishi et al., 2013; Kosciw et al., 
2012, 2014; Marshal et al., 2008; Poteat et al., 2013; Seil et al., 2014; Talley et al., 2014), 
we hypothesized: gay/lesbian adolescents, bisexual adolescents, and adolescents unsure of 
their sexual orientation (henceforth, “unsure adolescents”) would report more frequent 
drinking than heterosexual adolescents; and living in jurisdictions with more versus less 
affirmative LGBTQ school climates would be associated with less frequent drinking for all 
sexual orientations. This investigation extends previous research by analyzing data that is 
generalizable to adolescents from several jurisdictions in the United States to examine the 
effects of a more holistic measure of LGBTQ school climate on drinking behaviors for 
specific sexual-orientation subgroups.
2. METHODS
This study utilized Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) data collected from students in 
grades 9-12 from 14 jurisdictions that included several measures of sexual orientation—
sexual identity, behavior, or attraction—in 2005 and 2007, which represent the earliest years 
in which a sufficient number of jurisdictions included sexual orientation items to allow for 
pooled analyses. Each jurisdiction administered paper-pencil surveys to adolescents and 
used two-stage, cluster sampling strategies to produce representative, population-based 
samples (Brener et al., 2004). Methodology about the pooling of the dataset is described 
elsewhere (Mustanski et al., 2014). Drawing on minority stress theory (Meyer, 2003), we

 assumed that LGBTQ-affirmative school climates would be most pertinent for adolescents 
who self-identify as gay/lesbian or bisexual (versus grouping based on sexual behavior or 
attraction). Therefore, we focused solely on sexual identity in the current study, and 
analyzed data from the 8 jurisdictions that collected this information (see Table 1). Though 
Boston, Massachusetts collected information on sexual identity, this jurisdiction did not 
have data for the school climate variable and was therefore excluded from our analysis. We 
utilized data collected in 2005 and 2007 for each jurisdiction with 2 exceptions: we excluded 
2005 data from both Maine and Rhode Island because they did not measure sexual identity. 
Protocol approval was not necessary because deidentified data were obtained from 
secondary sources.
2.1. Measurements
2.1.1. Alcohol Use—We examined 3 alcohol use measures shown to have adequate test-
retest reliability (Brener et al., 2002). Number of drinking days was assessed with the 
question: “During the past 30 days, on how many days did you have at least one drink of 
alcohol?” Response options were 0, 1 or 2, 3 to 5, 6 to 9, 10 to 19, 20 to 29, and all 30 days. 
Number of days drinking at school was assessed with the question: “During the past 30 
days, on how many days did you have at least one drink of alcohol on school property?” 
Response options for this question were identical to those for the number of drinking days. 
Number of HED days was assessed with the question: “During the past 30 days, on how 
many days did you have 5 or more drinks of alcohol in a row, that is, within a couple of 
hours?” Response options were 0, 1, 2, 3 to 5, 6 to 9, 10 to 19, and 20 or more days. For 
each variable, we created a continuous count variable by assigning midpoint values to 
categories with ranges (e.g., 1 or 2 days was coded as 1.5), consistent with previous research 
(Cullen et al., 1999; DeSimone, 2010).
2.1.2. Student-Level Independent Variables—Demographic measures, including 
sexual orientation, were assessed via self-report. Sexual identity was assessed with the 
question: “Which of the following best describes you?” Response options included 
heterosexual (straight), gay or lesbian, bisexual, and not sure. Measures for gender, race/
ethnicity, and age are described elsewhere (Mustanski et al., 2014). Sexual orientation, 
gender, and race/ethnicity were dummy-coded and treated as categorical. In multivariable 
models, we treated age as a continuous variable and centered it at the grand median (16 
years) to provide meaningful intercepts (Raudenbush and Bryk, 2002).
2.1.3. Jurisdiction-Level Independent Variables—We created the LGBTQ school 
climate variable from the 2010 School Health Profile (SHP) survey, administered by the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Each jurisdiction administered two 
unique paper-pencil surveys: one survey to school principals and one survey to lead health 
education teachers using random, systematic, equal-probability sampling strategies to 
produce representative samples of schools (Brener et al., 2011). School principals and 
teachers completed surveys containing different items about their school, and LGBTQ 
school climate was measured with the following items after the initial stem “Does your 
school...”: have a gay-straight alliance or similar club; identify “safe spaces” for LGBTQ 
adolescents; prohibit harassment based on real or perceived sexual orientation; encourage

 staff to attend professional development activities about safe and supportive school 
environments for LGBTQ adolescents; provide LGBTQ-inclusive sexual health curricula; 
facilitate access to LGBTQ-competent health services outside school; and facilitate access to 
LGBTQ-competent social and psychological services outside school. Principals completed 
all items excluding the sexual health curricula item, which was completed by lead health 
education teachers. All items had yes/no response options. LGBTQ school climate items had 
excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α=0.97); additional details about this variable are 
described elsewhere (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2014). We standardized this variable, and 
positive scores indicated more affirmative school climates for LGBTQ adolescents.
To control for jurisdiction-level confounders, we adjusted for each jurisdiction's median 
household income and density of same-sex couples gathered from the 2010 United States 
Census. Bivariate analyses showed that both variables were positively associated with 
LGBTQ school climate (income: r=0.65, P=0.08; density of same-sex couples: r=0.84, 
P<0.01). To provide meaningful intercepts and effects in all our models, median household 
income was grand-mean centered and divided by 10,000, and the density of same-sex 
couples was grand-mean centered and multiplied by 1,000. Further detail on these variables 
is presented elsewhere (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2014).
2.2. Data Analyses
Analyses were conducted in Stata version 13 (College Station, Texas), and results in Tables 
1 and 2 used recommended weighting procedures (Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, 2014). We conducted complete case analyses. After excluding the few 
participants 12 years and younger (n=185), the sample included 57,427 participants. Missing 
data were minimal, ranging from 0.5% for age to 6.2% for number of drinking days. Of the 
participants who responded to at least one alcohol use question (n=56,681), 95.0% 
(n=53,814) had complete data for all independent variables. We allowed our sample sizes to 
vary for each alcohol use variable.
We conducted two-level hierarchical generalized linear models with students nested within 
jurisdictions. Models were fit using the GLLAMM (Generalized Linear Latent and Mixed 
Models) command (Rabe-Hesketh et al., 2004a). Because alcohol use was measured with 
continuous count responses, we fit models with Poisson distributions and log link functions. 
Robust “sandwich” estimators were used to account for overdispersion (Rabe-Hesketh and 
Skrondal, 2012). Since the GLLAMM command allows for a single sampling weight 
variable (Rabe-Hesketh et al., 2004b), we used an adjusted sampling weight variable in 
multivariable analyses, which has been used previously with these data (Birkett et al., 2014; 
Hatzenbuehler et al., 2014; Talley et al., 2014). Derivation of the weight variable is 
described elsewhere (Mustanski et al., 2014).
We engaged in a three-step model building process for each alcohol use variable. Model 1 
contained student-level variables. Model 2 contained student-level and jurisdiction-level 
variables. Model 3 contained student-level and jurisdiction-level variables as well as the 
cross-level interactions between sexual orientation and LGBTQ school climate, which were 
employed to test whether sexual orientation modified relationships between school climate 
and alcohol use. All models contained random intercepts, allowing alcohol use to vary by

 jurisdiction. Models containing random slopes for sexual-orientation subgroups did not 
converge; we fit cross-level interactions in random intercept models because a priori 
hypotheses about fixed effects take priority over random effects (Snijders and Bosker, 
2012). From Model 3, we estimated incidence-rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals, 
which correspond to a single standard deviation increase in the school climate variable for 
each sexual-orientation subgroup, while holding all variables constant.
3. RESULTS
Table 1 presents the frequency and percentage of each sexual-orientation subgroup by 
jurisdiction. Bivariate analyses shown in Table 2 indicate that gay/lesbian, bisexual, and 
unsure adolescents reported greater mean number of drinking days, drinking days at school, 
and HED days than heterosexual adolescents.
3.1. Drinking Days
Gay/lesbian, bisexual, and unsure adolescents drank on significantly more days in the past 
month than heterosexual adolescents, controlling for race/ethnicity, gender, and age (Model 
1, Table 3). In Model 2, controlling for student-level and jurisdiction-level variables, 
LGBTQ school climate was not associated with drinking days. The cross-level interactions 
were not significant (Model 3).
Table 4 shows the associations between LGBTQ school climate and alcohol use for each 
sexual-orientation subgroup. For heterosexual adolescents, living in jurisdictions with more 
(versus less) LGBTQ-affirmative school climates reported fewer drinking days—but the 
effect was small. The associations between living in more versus less LGBTQ-affirmative 
school climates and drinking days did not achieve statistical significance for gay/lesbian, 
bisexual, or unsure adolescents—however, living in more versus less LGBTQ-affirmative 
school climates was marginally associated with fewer drinking days for gay/lesbian 
adolescents.
3.2. Drinking Days at School
Gay/lesbian, bisexual, and unsure adolescents drank at school on significantly more days in 
the past month than heterosexual adolescents (Model 1, Table 3). Living in jurisdictions 
with more versus less affirmative LGBTQ school climates was associated with fewer 
drinking days at school (Model 2). Upon adding the cross-level interactions between school 
climate and sexual orientation (Model 3), the effect of LGBTQ school climate on drinking 
days at school was more protective for unsure adolescents than heterosexual adolescents 
(Model 3).
LGBTQ-affirmative school climates were associated with fewer drinking days at school for 
unsure adolescents (Table 4). LGBTQ-affirmative school climate was not associated with 
drinking days at school for heterosexual, gay/lesbian, or bisexual adolescents.

 3.3. Heavy Episodic Drinking Days
Gay/lesbian, bisexual, and unsure adolescents engaged in HED on more days than 
heterosexual adolescents (Model 1, Table 3). Living in jurisdictions with more versus less 
LGBTQ-affirmative school climates was associated with fewer HED days (Model 2). The 
cross-level interactions were not significant for gay/lesbian, bisexual, and unsure 
adolescents (Model 3).
Heterosexual and gay/lesbian adolescents living in jurisdictions with more (versus less) 
LGBTQ-affirmative school climates reported fewer HED days (Table 4). LGBTQ school 
climate was not associated with the number of HED days for bisexual or unsure adolescents; 
however, living in more versus less LGBTQ-affirmative school climates was marginally 
associated with fewer HED days for unsure adolescents, and the magnitude of this effect 
was similar to the protective effect found among gay/lesbian adolescents.
4. DISCUSSION
In general, our study showed that LGBTQ school climate was associated with fewer 
drinking days at school and fewer heavy episodic drinking days (Models 2 in Table 3). 
Specifically, heterosexual and gay/lesbian adolescents engaged in HED on fewer days if 
they lived in jurisdictions with more versus less affirmative LGBTQ school climates. Living 
in jurisdictions with more affirmative school climates was also associated with fewer days 
drinking at school for unsure adolescents. For bisexuals, there were no significant 
relationships between LGBTQ school climate and drinking behaviors.
Our finding regarding heterosexual adolescents—that they engaged in HED less frequently 
if they lived in more (versus less) LGBTQ-affirmative jurisdictions—aligns with previous 
research showing the presence (versus absence) of GSAs was associated with less alcohol 
use among heterosexual adolescents (Heck et al., 2011; Konishi et al., 2013; Poteat et al., 
2013). One potential explanation for this finding is, like gay/lesbian and bisexual 
adolescents, heterosexual adolescents are victimized because their peers perceive them as 
gay/lesbian or bisexual (Poteat and Espelage, 2007; Poteat et al., 2011), and this kind of 
victimization may be lower in jurisdictions more affirming of LGBTQ adolescents. Also, 
school climate for all students might be better in jurisdictions with greater affirmation of 
LGBTQ individuals (e.g., schools may be more likely to conduct student-centered 
education), which could reduce alcohol use for all adolescents. We also cannot rule out 
residual confounding in which some unmeasured variable is responsible for these 
associations. For instance, LGBTQ-affirmative jurisdictions may have more restrictive 
alcohol policies and taxation that affect adolescents’ drinking frequency. Future research 
should examine possible mechanisms and confounders that explain the associations between 
LGBTQ school climate and alcohol use.
For bisexual adolescents, LGBTQ-affirmative school climates were not significantly 
associated with drinking behaviors. These results suggest that LGBTQ-affirmative efforts in 
schools may not address the needs of bisexual adolescents. Biphobia could also explain this 
result, because bisexuals often experience bias from heterosexual and gay/lesbian 
individuals (Friedman et al., 2014). Like racism, biphobia and bisexual-related stigma

 manifest in multiple ways—ranging from covert to blatant, and internalized to structural 
(Hatzenbuehler et al., 2013). Similar to previous studies (Corliss et al., 2008; Marshal et al., 
2008; Talley et al., 2014), we found that bisexual adolescents had the greatest number of 
drinking days and HED days compared to other sexual-orientation subgroups. Moreover, 
bisexual adolescents comprised a larger segment of the population than gay/lesbian and 
unsure adolescents. These findings suggest that future research should: explore how school 
climates can be more affirmative of bisexual adolescents; examine reasons why bisexual 
adolescents are at elevated risk for alcohol use; and design, implement, and evaluate alcohol 
use interventions aimed at reducing alcohol use for bisexual adolescents.
For adolescents unsure of their sexual orientation, LGBTQ supportive school climates were 
associated with fewer school drinking days, marginally associated with fewer HED days, but 
not associated with fewer drinking days in general. Given the dearth of research on how 
social environments impact alcohol use for adolescents who are questioning their sexual 
orientation, we have little theoretical or empirical work to draw on to explain the observed 
patterns for this subgroup. Nevertheless, compared to heterosexuals, adolescents unsure of 
their sexual orientation are at greater risk for alcohol use and many other health risks—
suicide, illicit drug use, and peer victimization (Birkett et al., 2014; Hatzenbuehler et al., 
2014; Newcomb et al., 2014)—and more research about how social environments can 
support and affirm adolescents developing their sexual orientation is needed to inform 
interventions for these vulnerable youth.
4.1. Implications
Our study has direct implications for alcohol interventions. Like previous studies (Corliss et 
al., 2008; Marshal et al., 2008; Talley et al., 2014), we found that gay/lesbian, bisexual, and 
unsure adolescents engaged in drinking and HED more frequently than heterosexual peers. 
Thus, gay/lesbian, bisexual, and unsure adolescents must be recognized as priority 
populations for alcohol use interventions, especially because scant evidence exists about 
evidence-based interventions to reduce alcohol use among these groups (Coulter et al., 2014; 
Institute of Medicine, 2011).
We also showed that LGBTQ-affirmative school climates might reduce alcohol use for gay/
lesbian and unsure adolescents. Based on these findings, schools can create LGBTQ-
affirmative school climates by performing the following:
1)
Establish and enforce policies that protect adolescents from being bullied or 
harassed based on their sexual orientation.
2)
Create safe spaces and clubs for LGBTQ adolescents.
3)
Train school staff how to be competent about and support the needs of LGBTQ 
adolescents.
4)
Develop and implement interventions that reduce anti-LGBTQ prejudice among 
both students and staff.
5)
Teach adolescents from LGBTQ-inclusive curricula, especially in health and 
history.
Coulter et al.

 6)
Provide adolescents with LGBTQ-competent services, or provide referrals to 
such resources.
7)
Regularly provide staff, students, and parents with informational resources (e.g., 
websites, organizations) about how to be supportive of LGBTQ people.
These aspects of school climate are linked with feelings of safety, lower victimization, and 
improved mental health outcomes for gay/lesbian and bisexual adolescents (Goodenow et 
al., 2006; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2014; Heck et al., 2011; Konishi et al., 2013; Kosciw et al., 
2012, 2014; Poteat et al., 2013; Seil et al., 2014), and our study expanded these outcomes to 
include HED for gay/lesbian and heterosexual adolescents. Thus, creating and sustaining 
LGBTQ-welcoming and -affirming school environments may reduce hazardous drinking 
behaviors.
4.2. Limitations
Our findings should be considered in light of the study's limitations. We cannot infer 
causality because data were cross-sectional—plus the SHP data were from 2010, and YRBS 
data were from 2005 and 2007. Prior analyses, however, showed that the SHP school 
climate data from 2010 were highly correlated with SHP data from 2004 and 2006 
(Hatzenbuehler et al., 2014), suggesting that school climate data from 2010 were a good 
proxy for earlier school environment data. Yet the psychometric properties of the school 
climate variable are unknown, and it is possible that schools were implementing policies/
programs related to gender identity and expression but not sexual orientation. Furthermore, 
only principals and teachers completed LGBTQ school climate items; thus, we do not know 
whether students were aware of the LGBTQ resources present on campus. Future research is 
needed to examine correlations between students’ perceptions of school climates and 
objective indicators of these climates. Nevertheless, having principals and teachers report on 
LGBTQ school climate (as was done in our study) reduces bias related to having 
participants provide data for both the independent and dependent variables (Diez Roux, 
2007). Regarding the YRBS data, all measures were self-reported by students; and our 
recoding of the alcohol use variables may have caused misclassification, even though we 
used methods from previous studies (Cullen et al., 1999; DeSimone, 2010).
This study was also partly ecological in nature: SHP and YRBS data were not necessarily 
drawn from the same schools. Nevertheless, schools that participated in the SHP and YRBS 
were selected using probability sampling methods, which would likely cause non-
differential misclassification effects, biasing results towards the null. The small number of 
jurisdictions (n=8) reduced our statistical power for finding significant effects for 
jurisdiction-level variables and cross-level interactions (Snijders and Bosker, 2012), which 
could explain some of our marginally significant findings. There may also be residual 
confounding at the student level (e.g., socioeconomic status) and jurisdiction level (e.g., 
alcohol outlet density).
Though we used data representative of public high schools and students, they were only 
from 8 jurisdictions in the United States, which are among the more progressive 
jurisdictions in the country (Movement Advancement Project, 2015)—thereby limiting 
generalizability. Furthermore, we used identity-based measures of sexual orientation;

 therefore, our findings may not generalize to other operationalizations of sexual orientation, 
including behavior- and attraction-based measures.
4.3. Strengths
Despite these limitations, our study extended the literature (Heck et al., 2011; Konishi et al., 
2013; Kosciw et al., 2012, 2014; Poteat et al., 2013) on LGBTQ school climate and alcohol 
use. First, the LGBTQ school climate measure included multiple components, such as 
inclusive curriculum, services, and policies, whereas previous research often focused on 
individual aspects of LGBTQ school climate (e.g., only GSAs). Second, we examined the 
effects of LGBTQ school climate for specific sexual-orientation subgroups, rather than 
collapsing gay/lesbian, bisexual, and unsure adolescents into a single group; our results 
showed that LGBTQ supportive climates were associated with drinking for some, but not 
all, sexual-orientation subgroups. Third, the student-level and jurisdiction-level data in our 
study were derived from probability-based samples in 8 jurisdictions—thereby providing 
generalizable results for a substantial segment of youth living in the United States.
4.4. Conclusions
Our study addresses 1 of the 5 major recommendations put forth by the Institute of Medicine 
report: to examine social influences of health for gay/lesbian and bisexual individuals 
(Institute of Medicine, 2011). We found that LGBTQ-affirmative school climates were 
associated with reduced incidence of drinking days for gay/lesbian, unsure, and heterosexual 
adolescents. Therefore, LGBTQ-affirmative school climates may have salubrious health 
implications for nearly all adolescents, irrespective of their sexual identity.
