ABSTRACT
Background and objective The American Academy
of Pediatrics recommends that preterm infants complete
a predischarge ‘car seat challenge’ observation for
cardiorespiratory compromise while in a car seat. This
static challenge does not consider the more upright
position in a car or the vibration of the seat when the
car is moving. This pilot study was designed to assess
the cardiorespiratory effects of vibration, mimicking the
effect of being in a moving car, on preterm and term
infants.
Methods A simulator was designed to reproduce
vertical vibration similar to that in a rear-facing car seat
at 30 mph. 19 healthy newborn term and 21 preterm
infants, ready for hospital discharge, underwent
cardiorespiratory measurements while lying flat in a cot
(baseline), static in the seat (30°), simulator (40°) and
during motion (vibration 40°).
Results Median test age was 13 days (range 1–65 days)
and median weight was 2.5 kg (IQR: 2.1–3.1 kg).
Compared with baseline observations, only the total
number of desaturations was significantly increased when
infants were placed at 30° (p=0.03). At 40°, or with
vibration, respiratory and heart rates increased and
oxygen saturation decreased significantly. Profound
desaturations <85% significantly increased during
motion, regardless of gestational age.
Conclusions This is the first study to assess the effect
of motion on infants seated in a car safety seat. Term and
preterm infants showed significant signs of potentially
adverse cardiorespiratory effects in the upright position at
40°, particularly with simulated motion, not identified in
the standard challenge. A larger study is required to
investigate the significance of these results.
INTRODUCTION
Infant car safety seats are used for infants from
birth up to 10 kg. They may be too big to effect-
ively secure low-birthweight or preterm infants
who are discharged home from neonatal intensive
care units (NICUs), at weights of 1.8–2.5 kg.1 In
these seats, the prominent occiput of a preterm
infant may push the head forward, particularly
during sleep, potentially causing airway obstruc-
tion. Studies have shown that premature infants are
prone to drops in blood oxygen saturation, and
apnoea or hypoventilation when restrained in car
seats,2–4 in up to 60% of infants studied.5 The
American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recom-
mends that all preterm infants should undergo
monitoring in a car seat before discharge—for
apnoea, bradycardia or desaturations,6 7 and many
UK hospitals follow this advice. The significance
and potential impact of these problems is not
clear,8 9 but there have been reports of deaths of
infants who have been left in a sitting position,
including in car seats—both on journeys, and when
parents have used it as an alternative to a pushchair
or cot for the infant to sleep in.10–13
One survey noted that 94% of infants, below
5 months of age, spent over 30 min a day in seating
devices including car seats.14 The mean was 5.7
±3.5 hours. There have been no studies looking at
the effects on infants over such prolonged periods
in a sitting position.
There are no universal guidelines on implement-
ing the car seat challenge,15–17 and commonly the
angle of the back of the car seat to the horizontal is
not reported although in a vehicle it should be
40°–45° for maximum protective effect. In our hos-
pital, the challenge is routinely performed with the
car seat placed on the floor, using the carrying
handle for stability (like many UK units surveyed,
see online supplementary appendix 1). The angle
of the seat’s back to the floor is approximately 30°,
which is flatter than the position in a vehicle.
No published studies have monitored infants in
moving vehicles, so there is no data on whether
infants experience more or less cardiorespiratory
compromise when travelling. Hence, it is unknown
whether
the
‘car
seat
challenge’
as
currently
What is already known on this topic?
▸ Some infants seated in car safety seats show
signs of cardiorespiratory compromise.
▸ The infant car seat challenge is used in
neonatal units to determine if the infant can
travel safely in a car.
▸ The static challenge does not take into account
the more upright position of the seat or the
effect of motion when the car is moving.
What this study adds?
▸ This is the first study to carry out the car seat
challenge in a simulated moving car seat.
▸ Infants showed signs of cardiorespiratory
compromise, which were undetected in the
static car seat challenge.
▸ The moving challenge may be a better test to
determine if infants can travel safely in a car
seat but further research is required.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Study aims
This pilot study investigated the physiological effects on healthy
term and preterm infants placed in a static car seat at 30° and
40°, and whether the motion of a moving vehicle had any
adverse or beneficial effects. It replicates the normal routine of a
parent preparing and taking their infant on a car journey.
Study design
Ethical approval was granted. Informed written consent was
obtained from both parents of participating infants. Mothers in
late pregnancy attending antenatal clinics were informed about
the study. Interested mothers of healthy infants were visited 12–
24 hours after delivery to obtain consent. Given that many term
infants were discharged within hours after normal delivery,
many infants recruited were delivered by caesarean section.
Healthy term or preterm infants on NICU shortly due for dis-
charge were also eligible.
Exclusion criteria included unwell infants, those with known
congenital anomalies, cardiorespiratory disease or hypotonia
from any cause.
All infants in the study were due to take a similar (non-
monitored) journey home in a car seat within days of the study.
Study protocol
After random allocation to one of two protocols (to investigate
test order), the infants underwent physiological monitoring for
30 min in a car seat in each of the three positions.
Protocol A:
I.
on a horizontal surface, seating angle 30° (static)
II.
on the simulator, seating angle of 40° (static)
III. on the simulator, seating angle of 40° with movements to
simulate being in a car travelling at 30 mph (motion).
Protocol B:
I.
on the simulator, seating angle 40° (static)
II.
on the simulator, seating angle 40° (in motion)
III. on a horizontal surface, seating angle 30° (static).
Each of these conditions was compared with baseline—a
period before testing when the infant was asleep supine in a cot,
for up to 90 min after a feed.
As all infants were due to go home within days of testing, for
the 30° position, the infants’ own car seats were used. All
infants underwent testing at 40° in the stationary vibration rig.
The two protocols were designed to determine whether any
identified physiological disturbances observed were more likely
to be a consequence of being in the car seat, the angle of the car
seat or the presence of movement, including identifying any
effect from infant sleep state, or the possible effects of being in
a car seat for a long period.
Motion simulator
A motion simulator was developed to reproduce vertical vibra-
tion broadly representative of that at the base of a car safety seat
fixed in a rear-facing position in the back seat of a small family
car (see figure 1 and online supplementary video 1). The angle
of fixation was approximately 40° to the horizontal, using the
standard Isofix system. The simulator was designed, manufac-
tured and tested by the Human Factors Research Unit within
the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research at the University
of Southampton and received ethical approval for use in
neonates. The simulator reproduced the vertical vibrations from
travelling at 30 mph on a straight urban road, excluding
braking, acceleration or going over bumps (see online supple-
mentary appendix 2).
Infant monitoring
Physiological
recordings
were
made
using
a
‘capnocheck’
recording system (Oxi-pulse sleep capnograph, Pulmolink UK)
allowing continuous recording of inspiratory and expiratory
carbon
dioxide
levels
(EtCO2),
oxygen
saturation
(SpO2),
respiratory rate (RR) and heart rate (HR), sampled at 1 s inter-
vals. The monitor has an artefact rejection programme designed
to cope with movement. All infants were constantly observed by
an experienced neonatal nurse and/or doctor. A report was gen-
erated for each infant in each position using the PROFOX
Respiratory Oximetry Software.
If any significant episodes of apnoea (more than 15 s) or
oxygen desaturation (<85% for more than 20 s) were observed,
the test was immediately stopped. These pragmatic cut-offs were
chosen to minimise responses to minor, artefactual or self-
limiting apnoea or desaturation while ensuring a prompt
response to more significant episodes and minimising any risk
to the infant. Resuscitation equipment and trained personnel
were available immediately.
Statistical analyses
In this pilot study, we aimed to recruit 20 term and 20 preterm
infants. No studies in a vibrating car seat have been conducted;
hence, the nature, frequency and magnitude of any adverse
effects were unknown. The sample size was pragmatic, by each
infant acting as his/her own control (ie, each being studied in
each condition—static and moving), and this should generate
CIs for potential discernible treatment effects to help inform a
larger study. It is unknown whether the movement of a simu-
lated car journey would make such effects more or less likely or
severe.
The sampled values for all parameters were imported into an
Excel spreadsheet, and all analyses were conducted using SPSS
V
.23.
The mean values obtained in each condition for each infant
for SpO2, EtCO2, HR and RR were used as point estimates
(ie, as single-value units of interest). Given the small numbers
and skewed nature of the data a non-parametric approach was

 used for the paired data (Wilcoxon test). The McNemar’s test
was used for categorical paired data. For looking at differences
in test order the Mann-Whitney and χ2 tests were used. Every
infant was to undergo three study positions randomly assigned
as per protocol and data from each study were compared with
the baseline observation period in the cot.
Similar comparisons were made for the frequency and dur-
ation of dips in saturation (a fall in SpO2 ≥4% lasting for ≥10 s
and SpO2 below 85% for at least 4 s), episodes of apnoea
(pauses of >10 s) and bradycardia (<100 bpm in preterms,
<60 bpm in term infants).
RESULTS
Infant demographics
Forty infants were studied; 21 preterm (53%) and 22 were male
(55%). The median gestational age was 36 weeks (IQR: 31–39
weeks), ranging from 27 weeks 5 days to 41 weeks 5 days. The
median birth weight was 2.5 kg (IQR: 1.5–3.2 kg) ranging from
0.8 to 4.8 kg. Seventeen infants were born by normal vaginal
delivery (42.5%), 10 by elective (25.0%) and 13 by emergency
caesarean section (32.5%).
Data at testing
The median age at testing was 13 days (IQR: 6–33 days) ranging
from 1 day after birth to 65 days. Preterm or very low-
birthweight infants were tested when they were mature enough

 for discharge. The postmenstrual age at testing ranged from
34 weeks 3 days to 42 weeks 4 days. The median weight was
2.5 kg (IQR: 2.1–3.1 kg) ranging from 1.6 to 4.8 kg.
W
e aimed to test each infant in each condition for 30 min but
interruptions from infant care procedures meant that the actual
times varied and not all tests were completed in a few cases.
The baseline recordings with the infant placed supine in a cot
ranged from 17 to 120 min with a median of 60 min; thus, the
results were adjusted to a standard 30 min or per unit of time
tested.
Many infants put their chin on their chest during testing but
three infants slumped forward during vibration (see figure 2).
Their position was left while they maintained normal oxygen
saturations to observe what would happen. They lifted their
head up briefly at intervals but could not maintain this position.
Outcome for all infants
Table 1 shows the outcomes for all infants comparing measure-
ments at rest in the cot (reference group) with the three other
positions. The only significant difference in the outcome vari-
ables comparing baseline to the 30° position was a higher
number of total desaturations at 30°.
However, infants in the static 40° position and in motion had
significantly higher HR and RR, lower SpO2 and more total
desaturations, compared with baseline. In motion, episodes of
desaturation <85% were also significantly increased, a median
of six episodes versus one when at rest. Episodes of bradycardia
and apnoea were slightly but not significantly more common at
rest. EtCO2 level rose slightly but non-significantly at 40° and in
motion.
Term versus preterm
Preterm infants were older at testing (median 25 days, range
7–65 days) compared with term infants (median 6 days, range
1–15 days).
Table 2 shows the same outcomes as in table 1 but for term
infants only. The numbers are smaller, hence the potential for
significance is reduced, but the direction of the differences per-
sisted and was similar in term and preterm infants.
T
erm infants placed in the static 40° position had significantly
higher HR and RR and lower SpO2. In motion, the increased
HR did not reach significance compared with baseline but the
RR was significantly higher, the SpO2 significantly lower and
the number of desaturations was increased.
Table 3 shows the same outcomes as in table 1 but for
preterm infants only. The differences are in the same direction
but slightly less marked compared with term infants.
In comparison with term infants baseline HRs were much
higher, and although the rates increased sequentially when the
infants were seated at 30°, 40° and in motion these differences
were not statistically significant compared with baseline. The
median SpO2 dropped from baseline but was only significant

 during motion. The number of desaturations was much higher
among preterm infants (5) at baseline and rose significantly
during
motion.
RR
showed
a
significant
increase
at
40°
but not when in motion. EtCO2 levels were higher in all
positions, with fewer bradycardic events and a similar number
of apnoeic events, but no significant differences between
positions.
The order of testing did not affect the results.
DISCUSSION
This is the first study of its kind looking at the physiological car-
diorespiratory response in infants seated in a moving car seat.
W
e have shown that the simulation rig is safe to use and iden-
tified physiological disturbances not seen under static conditions
in many infants. It may thus be a more accurate predictor of
potential cardiorespiratory risk compared with the standard car
seat challenge.
The finding that significant potentially adverse physiological
effects were more frequent when the infant was at 40° and in
motion than when at 30° regardless of which test came first sug-
gests that it is the more upright position and the addition of
movement that is responsible rather than an effect of a pro-
longed period in the sitting position.
W
e tested infants for up to 30 min—a relatively short journey
time; however, some had frequent (up to 16) significant desa-
turations (<85% for ≥4 s) during this time. The vibration test
reproduced motion in a straight line—no bumps, turns, braking
or acceleration, so this probably underestimates the effect of
travelling on real roads. Previous studies of infants in static car
seats have noted that cardiorespiratory problems increase in fre-
quency with longer periods in a car seat.1 18
All infants in our study were healthy but the effects in infants
with cardiorespiratory disease or hypotonia may be more
marked, as has been shown in the static car seat challenge.19
The low muscle tone and prominent occiput of preterm
infants may lead to neck flexion and possible airway obstruc-
tion when in a car seat,20 and this may be exacerbated by
motion. Some preterm infants with recurrent desaturations
flopped
forward
in
an
extremely
flexed
position
during
motion, raising their heads intermittently but could not main-
tain a raised head position. The head and shoulders came
forward despite shoulder straps, which may be too long for
smaller infants allowing some forward movement.2 While
head supports with cut-outs over the occipital area have been
shown to reduce neck flexion,21 further research using them
during motion is indicated. Parents often leave their infant
alone in the back seat when travelling, and on long journeys
the infant may slump forward in this way, resulting in respira-
tory compromise. Our findings suggest that it may be benefi-
cial on a long journey for an adult to sit with the infant in
the back of the car or use a mirror to observe the infant’s
position.

 This small-scale pilot study was designed to identify any
potential adverse effects of a more upright position and of
motion on infants in car seats. Limitations are its small size, lack
of randomisation of the infants studied, the lack of formal sleep
state monitoring and the limited time each infant spent in a car
seat.
W
e have shown potential changes in cardiorespiratory stability
during periods in which the infant is in a more upright position
than usually used in static car seat challenges, and the exacerba-
tion of these effects during simulated movement in some
infants. W
e cannot be certain of the clinical significance or
potential risks posed by the changes we have identified, which
could be a consequence of position, restraint, movement or a
combination of all three. The infants in the supine position
were not restrained (as they would be in a car bed); thus, we
cannot assess the effects of restraint in this position.
More research is needed to quantify these effects, and to
investigate how best to avoid them if they are clinically signifi-
cant. In particular, there is a need for larger studies to investi-
gate the effect of increasing infant age (and thus size), and
duration of journey time, together with simulating the effects of
changes in vehicle speed and direction.
The importance of protecting infants in the event of a
moving vehicle accident must be emphasised, and infant car
seats must be used whenever infants travel in cars (as per UK
law),22 23 but these findings support the AAP guideline that
infant car seats should not be used as a routine infant sleep
environment.24
CONCLUSIONS
This is a unique pilot study—the first to look at the physio-
logical effect of vibration on infants in a car safety seat. The
standard static car seat challenge currently used in hospitals
does not reflect the angle or motion of the journey undertaken
by the infant. The infant, in a seat placed at the more upright
40° position plus vibration experienced in a car, shows signifi-
cantly increased HR, RR and decreased SpO2. Simulating
motion reveals a striking increase in potentially clinically signifi-
cant oxygen desaturations. Surprisingly these differences were
similar in term and preterm infants.
The motion simulator offers the possibility of further investi-
gation of the potential benefits and limitations of various
designs of infant car seats. This may lead to a revision of
current recommendations for testing infants’ suitability for
travel in an infant car seat and also have implications for the
design of car seats for newborn infants.
