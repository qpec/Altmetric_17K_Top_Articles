INTRODUCTION 
 
DNA methylation-based biomarkers, often referred to 
as “epigenetic age” or "epigenetic clock", are robust 
estimators of chronological age of an individual [1–4]. 
For example, a measure of epigenetic age based on 
levels of methylation in 353 CpG dinucleotide markers 
(cytosine linked to guanine by a phosphate group) 
allow the estimation of the age of an individual. This 
estimate is consistent across most types of biological 
specimens, including whole blood, brain, breast, 
kidney, liver, lung, and saliva and cell types, including 
CD4+ T cells, monocytes, B cells, glial cells, and 
neurons [3]. 
 
Recent studies suggested that epigenetic age is associated 
with age-related health outcomes above and beyond 
chronological age. For example, we and others have 
shown that individuals whose epigenetic age was greater 
than their chronological age (i.e., individuals exhibiting 
epigenetic "age acceleration") were at an increased risk 
for death from all causes, even after accounting for 
known risk factors [5–7]. Further, we recently showed 
that the offspring of semi-supercentenarians (subjects 
who reached an age of 105-109 years) have a lower 
epigenetic age than age-matched controls [8]. Based on 
these findings, it has been hypothesized that epigenetic 
age captures some aspect of biological age and the 
resulting susceptibility to disease and multiple health 
outcomes. A first step in testing this hypothesis is to test 
whether epigenetic age predicts longevity in multiple 
populations and across ethnic groups. 
 
In many studies epigenetic age is estimated from DNA 
derived from blood samples. It is well known that blood 
cell composition changes with age and some of these  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
changes might be independent predictors of mortality [9–
12]. Thus, it is of interest to understand whether 
considering information on blood cell composition in 
measures of epigenetic age improves their predictive 
power for mortality. 
 
Here, we evaluated the ability to predict time to death 
for 
blood-based 
epigenetic 
age 
measures, 
both 
published 
and 
novel 
measures 
that 
incorporate 
information on blood cell composition. Due to the well 
documented 
age-related 
changes 
in 
blood 
cell 
composition, we distinguished epigenetic measures of 
age that were independent of changes in blood cell 
composition (cell-intrinsic measures), and measures that 
incorporated 
age-related 
changes 
in 
blood 
cell 
composition ("extrinsic" measures). By increasing the 
number of independent cohort studies, we more than 
doubled the number of mortality events available for 
analysis, which allowed for detailed subgroup analyses 
including those based on race/ethnicity. 
 
RESULTS 
 
Cohort studies 
 
Our 
meta-analysis 
included 
13 
population-based 
cohorts. An overview of the cohorts is provided in 
Table 1. Our study involved 3 racial/ethnic groups: non-
Hispanic whites (n=9,215), Hispanics (n=431), and 
Blacks (n=3,443). Detailed descriptions of each cohort 
can be found in the Supplemental Materials. 
 
 
 
ABSTRACT 
 
Estimates of biological age based on DNA methylation patterns, often referred to as "epigenetic age", "DNAm
age", have been shown to be robust biomarkers of age in humans. We previously demonstrated that
independent of chronological age, epigenetic age assessed in blood predicted all‐cause mortality in four human
cohorts. Here, we expanded our original observation to 13 different cohorts for a total sample size of 13,089
individuals, including three racial/ethnic groups. In addition, we examined whether incorporating information
on blood cell composition into the epigenetic age metrics improves their predictive power for mortality. All
considered measures of epigenetic age acceleration were predictive of mortality (p≤8.2x10‐9), independent of
chronological age, even after adjusting for additional risk factors (p<5.4x10‐4), and within the racial/ethnic
groups that we examined (non‐Hispanic whites, Hispanics, African Americans). Epigenetic age estimates that
incorporated information on blood cell composition led to the smallest p‐values for time to death (p=7.5x10‐43).
Overall, this study a) strengthens the evidence that epigenetic age predicts all‐cause mortality above and
beyond chronological age and traditional risk factors, and b) demonstrates that epigenetic age estimates that
incorporate information on blood cell counts lead to highly significant associations with all‐cause mortality.

Epigenetic age estimation 
 
We used two methods for estimating the epigenetic age  
of each blood sample (Table 2). First, we used the 
approach by Horvath (2013) based on 353 CpGs, as 
described in [3] and Methods. Second, we used the 
approach by Hannum et al. (2013) based on 71 CpGs 
[2]. Both epigenetic age estimates were correlated with 
chronological age at the time of blood draw (Table 1) 
with biweight midcorrelation coefficients ranging from 
0.65 to 0.89. But birth cohorts were excluded from this 
correlation analysis because it is not meaningful to 
calculate correlations with chronological age in this 
situation. The Horvath and Hannum estimates were also 
highly correlated with each other (r=0.76) even though 
the underlying sets of CpGs share only 6 CpGs in 
common. (Supplementary Table 1). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Estimated 
blood 
cell 
counts 
that 
relate 
to 
chronological age 
 
We estimated the abundance of ten blood cell types based 
on observed DNA methylation patterns (Methods) –
exhausted/senescent 
CD8+ 
T 
cells 
(CD8+CD28-
CD45RA-), CD8+ naïve, CD8+ total, CD4+ naïve, 
CD4+ total, natural killer cells, B cells, monocytes, 
granulocytes, and plasmablasts. To study age-related 
changes in blood cell composition, we correlated these 
estimated blood cell counts with chronological age in all 
of the cohort studies (Supplementary Table 2). Our 
results are congruent with findings from flow cytometric 
studies that demonstrate that the abundance of naïve 
CD8+ T cells decreases with age (reflecting thymic 
involution), whereas exhausted/senescent CD8+ T cells 
increase with age [9–12].

 An overview of several measures of epigenetic age 
acceleration is presented in Table 2. One such measure 
(denoted as AgeAccel) is defined as the residual that 
results from regressing epigenetic age on chronological 
age. Thus, a positive value of AgeAccel indicates that the 
epigenetic age is higher than expected, based on 
chronological age. These Horvath and Hannum based 
measures 
of 
age 
acceleration 
are 
denoted 
by 
AgeAccelHorvath and AgeAccelHannum, respectively. For the 
sake of brevity and consistency with other publications 
from our group, we abbreviate AgeAccelHorvath as 
AgeAccel. 
 
AgeAccelHannum and to a lesser extent AgeAccel were 
previously shown to correlate with blood cell counts 
[5]. Thus, we distinguished two broad categories of 
measures of epigenetic age acceleration when dealing 
with DNA methylation from blood or peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs): intrinsic and extrinsic 
epigenetic measures, which are independent of, or 
enhanced by blood cell count information, respectively. 
We define intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (IEAA) 
as the residual resulting from regressing epigenetic age 
on chronological age and measures of blood cell counts 
(Methods). By definition, IEAA is not correlated with 
chronological age and is weakly correlated with 
estimated measures of blood cell counts (Supplementary 
Table 4). IEAA is meant to capture cell-intrinsic 
properties of the aging  process  that  exhibit  some  pre- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
servation across various cell types and organs. 
Compared to our other measures of age acceleration, 
IEAA, adapted from the Horvath measure of epigenetic 
age, exhibited significant correlations with epigenetic 
age acceleration in breast tissue (r=0.48, p=0.0011, 
Figure 1B) and saliva (r=0.67, p=8.8x10-9, Figure 1F). 
By contrast, an analogous measure of IEAA based on 
the Hannum measure showed much weaker correlations 
(r=0.073 in breast and r=0.41 in saliva Figure 1D, 1H). 
For this reason, we focused on the Horvath measure of 
IEAA. 
 
The age-related changes to blood cell composition 
(Supplementary Table 4) can be leveraged to capture 
aspects of immunosenescence. Using these measures, 
we derived a novel extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration 
(EEAA) measure by up-weighting the blood cell count 
contributions 
of 
AgeAccelHannum 
(Methods 
and 
Supplementary Table 4). 
 
Descriptive statistics (minimum, maximum, median) of 
the measures of epigenetic age acceleration can be 
found in Supplementary Table 3. 
 
Cox regression models of all-cause mortality

Figure 2. Univariate Cox regression meta‐analysis of all‐cause mortality. A univariate Cox regression model was used to relate
the censored survival time (time to all‐cause mortality) to (A) the universal measure of age acceleration (AgeAccel), (B) intrinsic
epigenetic age acceleration (IEAA), (C) extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (EEAA). The rows correspond to the different
cohorts. Each row depicts the hazard ratio and a 95% confidence interval. The coefficient estimates from the respective studies
were meta‐analyzed using a fixed‐effect model weighted by inverse variance (implemented in the metafor R package [34]). It is
not appropriate to compare the hazard ratios and confidence intervals of the different measures directly because the measures
have different scales/distributions. However, it is appropriate to compare the meta analysis p values (red sub‐title of each plot).
The p‐value of the heterogeneity test (Cochran's Q‐test) is significant if the cohort‐specific estimates differed substantially.

Figure 4. Hazard ratio of death versus cohort characteristics. Each circle corresponds to a cohort (data set). Circle sizes
correspond to the square root of the number of observed deaths, because the statistical power of a Cox model is determined by the
number of observed deaths. (A‐C) The y‐axis of each panel corresponds to the natural log of the hazard ratio (ln HR) of a univariate Cox
regression model for all‐cause mortality. Each panel corresponds to a different measure of epigenetic age acceleration (A) universal age
acceleration, (B) intrinsic age acceleration, (C) extrinsic age acceleration. Panels (D‐F) are analogous to those in A‐C but the x‐axis
corresponds to the median age of the subjects at baseline (Table 1). The title of each panel reports the Wald test statistic (T) and
corresponding p‐value resulting from a weighted linear regression model (y regressed on x) where each point (data set) is weighted by
the square root of the number of observed deaths. The dotted red line represents the regression line. The black solid line represents the
line of identify (i.e., no association).

 Our novel measure of extrinsic age acceleration EEAA 
led to smaller p-values for the associations with all-cause 
mortality than the original measure AgeAccelHannum in 
univariate 
Cox 
models 
(pEEAA=7.5x10-43, 
pAgeAccelHannum=1.4x10-34, Supplementary Figure 1) and in 
multivariate 
Cox 
models 
(pEEAA=3.4x10-19, 
pAgeAccelHannum=6x10-15, Supplementary Figure 2). Further, 
when both EEAA and AgeAccelHannum were included in 
the same Cox model, only EEAA remained significant in 
the WHI data and FHS univariate models. Since these 
results indicate that EEAA outperforms the closely related 
measure AgeAccelHannum when it comes to mortality 
prediction, we removed the latter from subsequent 
analyses. 
 
All considered measures of epigenetic age acceleration 
were predictive of time to death in univariate Cox 
models 
(pAgeAccel=1.9x10-11, 
pIEAA=8.2x10-9, 
pEEAA=7.5x10-43, Figure 2) and multivariate Cox models 
adjusting for risk factors and pre-existing disease status 
(pAgeAccel=5.4x10-5, 
pIEAA=5.0x10-4, 
pEEAA=3.4x10-19, 
Figure 3). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Interpreting effect sizes and variance of epigenetic 
age acceleration 
 
Subjects differed substantially in terms of their 
measures of epigenetic age acceleration, e.g. EEAA 
ranged from -28 to 28 years in the WHI (standard 
deviation =6.4 years, Supplementary Table 3). 
 
About five percent of the participants of the WHI 
exhibited an EEAA value larger than 10, which is 
associated with a 48% increased hazard of death as can 
be seen from the following calculation. The HR of 
EEAA is 1.040 if EEAA=1 (Figure 2c) but it is 
HR=1.48=(1.040)10 if EEAA=10. Negative values of 
age acceleration were associated with a lower hazard of 
mortality. For example, 20% of subjects had an EEAA 
value less than -5, which is associated with an 18% 
decrease in the hazard of death (HR=0.82=1.04-5).

between EEAA and time to death remained  highly signi-

 ficant in subgroups stratified by race, sex, follow-up 
duration, body mass index, smoking status, physical 
activity (Table 3) and in subgroups stratified by 
prevalent disease at baseline such as cancer, coronary 
artery disease, hypertension and type 2 diabetes (Table 
4). Only one subgroup led to an insignificant finding 
(p>0.05) in our univariate model analysis: namely 
subjects with less than 5 years of follow up (Table 3). 
For multivariate models, we failed to observe 
significant associations for the following subgroups: i) 
less than 5 years of follow up, ii) between 5 and 10 
years of follow up, iii) current smokers, iv) obese 
individuals, v) Hispanics, vi) individuals with cancer, 
and vii) subjects with coronary artery disease. The 
insignificant results in multivariate models in cancer 
patients or CAD patients might reflect the relatively low 
sample sizes or that epigenetic age acceleration is 
dwarfed by other predictors of mortality in subjects with 
severe diseases. Hazard ratio estimates remained highly 
consistent across all subgroups examined. 
 
We did not observe significant differences in the 
estimated hazard ratios across any subgroup (Tables 3 
and 4). Specifically, racial/ethnic differences in HR 
were not observed (interaction p=0.62 in age-
adjustment models and p=0.14 in full models). Overall, 
these subgroup analysis results confirm that epigenetic 
age acceleration is an independent predictor of earlier 
mortality even after adjusting for possible confounders 
and within major subgroups of the population. 
 
Hazard ratio of death versus follow up time and 
median age 
 
The large number of cohorts allowed us to relate cohort 
characteristics (such as median age or median follow up 
removing time) to strength of association with 
mortality. We did not find a statistically significant 
relationship between the hazard ratio of death for the 
median age of the cohort or the follow up time (Figure 
4). 
 
Robustness analysis 
 
To assess the robustness of our findings, we also carried 
out a leave-one-out analysis by re-running the 
metaanalysis after removing data from individual 
cohorts. The resulting p-values are highly robust with 
respect to a single data set from the analysis 
(Supplementary Table 5). In our study, we used a fixed 
effects meta-analysis method for the sake of consistency 
with previous analyses [5]. However, our results remain 
qualitatively the same after using a random effects 
meta-analysis method (Supplementary Figure 4). 
DISCUSSION 
 
The current study corroborates previous findings 
regarding the predictive power of DNA methylation-
based biomarkers of age for mortality [5,6,8]. We 
further examined novel variants of these measures that 
are either independent of blood cell counts or are 
enhanced by changes in blood cell sub-populations. We 
showed that the extrinsic measure EEAA out-performs 
previous measures of age acceleration when it comes to 
predicting 
all-cause 
mortality. 
Furthermore, 
the 
associations between epigenetic age acceleration and 
mortality did not differ significantly across subgroups 
of race/ethnicity, sex, BMI, smoking status, physical 
activity status, or major chronic diseases. The 
consistency of 
the associations 
across 
multiple 
subgroups lends support to the notion that epigenetic 
age acceleration captures some aspect of biological 
aging over and above chronological age and other risk 
factors. 
 
The development of suitable measures of biological age 
has been a key goal in the field of aging research [13]. 
Many biomarkers of age have been posited including 
epigenetic alterations of the DNA (e.g., DNA 
methylation), transcriptomic changes in blood [14], 
telomere length [15], whole-body function such as gait 
speed (reviewed in [16]). The current study does not 
aim to replace existing blood based biomarkers, but 
rather, we aimed to demonstrate that it complements 
existing markers. Above all, this study shows that 
epigenetic age captures an aspect of biological age, as 
assessed 
through 
lifespan, 
above 
and 
beyond 
chronological age, blood cell composition, and a host of 
traditional risk factors of mortality. 
 
The measures of epigenetic age acceleration are 
attractive because they are highly robust and because 
their measurement only involve DNA methylation data. 
While actual flow cytometry data will always be 
preferable to imputed blood cell count data (based on 
DNA 
methylation data), the measures of age 
acceleration do not require the measurement of flow 
data. Rather, measures of intrinsic and extrinsic 
epigenetic age used blood cell count estimates resulting 
from DNA methylation data. The measure of extrinsic 
age acceleration EEAA reflects aspects of immuno-
senescence because, by construction, it correlates with 
age-related changes in blood cell composition, such as 
T lymphocyte populations, which underlie much of the 
age-related decline in the protective immune response 
[9–12]. Thus, the high predictive significance of EEAA 
for all-cause mortality probably reflects the fact that it 
assesses multiple aspects of the biological age of the 
immune system including both changes in blood cell

 composition and cell-intrinsic epigenetic changes. It has 
been known for decades that poor T cell functioning is 
predictive of mortality [17]. 
 
The findings surrounding the predictive utility of 
intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration are biologically 
compelling and point to a new frontier in aging 
research. Our study strongly suggests IEAA is reflective 
of an intrinsic epigenetic clock that is associated with 
mortality independent of chronological age, changes in 
blood cell composition, and traditional risk factors of 
mortality. 
IEAA 
probably 
captures 
a 
cell-type 
independent component of the aging process for the 
following reasons. First, IEAA is moderately preserved 
across different tissues and cell types collected from the 
same subject (Figure 1). Second, IEAA but not EEAA is 
predictive of lung cancer [18]. Third, only IEAA and 
AgeAccel relate to centenarian status [8]. 
 
Overall, our results inform the ongoing debate about 
whether epigenetic biomarkers of age capture an aspect 
of biological age. While epigenetic processes are 
unlikely to be the only mediators of chronological age 
on mortality—in fact, multiple risk factors have 
stronger effects on mortality—our results suggest that at 
least one of the mediating processes relates to the 
epigenetic age of blood tissue and that this process is 
independent of age-dependent changes in blood cell 
composition. Future studies will be useful for gaining a 
mechanistic understanding of this intrinsic epigenetic 
aging process. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Measures of epigenetic age 
 
We used an epigenetic biomarker of age based on 353 
CpG markers as one measure of epigenetic age because: 
a) it is an accurate measurement of age across multiple 
tissues [3]; b) we previously showed that it is predictive 
of all-cause mortality [5]; c) it correlated with measures 
of cognitive/physical fitness and neuro-pathology in the 
elderly [19,20]; and d) it was associated with conditions 
that are of interest in aging research including Down's 
syndrome [21], Huntington's disease [22], Parkinson's 
disease [23], obesity [24], HIV infection [25], 
menopause [26], centenarian status [27], ethnicity and 
sex [28], and cellular senescence [3,29]. This epigenetic 
age estimator not only lends itself to measuring aging 
effects in elderly subjects; but also applies to prenatal 
brain samples [30] and blood samples from minors [31]. 
Epigenetic age is defined as the predicted value of age 
based on the DNA methylation levels of 353 CpGs. 
Mathematical details and software tutorials for 
estimating epigenetic age can be found in the additional 
files of [3]. All of the described epigenetic measures of 
aging and age acceleration are implemented in our 
freely available software (https://dnamage.genetics. 
ucla.edu) [3]. 
 
DNA methylation age estimate by Hannum et al 
(2013) 
 
We also used an alternative measure of epigenetic age 
developed by Hannum et al (2013) [2]. The resulting 
age estimate is based on the 71 CpGs and coefficient 
values from the third supplementary table [2]. The 
authors developed this age prediction method by using 
an elastic net regression model for predicting 
chronological age based on DNA methylation levels 
from whole blood. 
 
Measures of epigenetic age acceleration 
 
Table 2 provides an overview of our measures of 
epigenetic age acceleration. The universal measure of 
age acceleration (AgeAccel), which is valid for a wide 
range of tissue types, is defined as the residual resulting 
from a linear regression model that regresses the 
Horvath estimate of epigenetic age on chronological 
age. Thus, a positive value for AgeAccel indicates that 
the observed epigenetic age is higher than that 
predicted, based on chronological age. AgeAccel has a 
relatively weak correlation with blood cell counts [25], 
but it still relates to estimated blood cell counts, as seen 
in Supplementary Table 4. 
 
To estimate "pure" epigenetic aging effects that are not 
influenced by differences in blood cell counts 
("intrinsic" epigenetic age acceleration, IEAA), we 
obtained the residual resulting from a multivariate 
regression model of epigenetic age on chronological age 
and various blood immune cell counts (naive CD8+ T 
cells, exhausted CD8+ T cells, plasmablasts, CD4+ T 
cells, natural killer cells, monocytes, and granulocytes) 
imputed from methylation data. 
 
Extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration measures capture 
both cell intrinsic methylation changes and extracellular 
changes in blood cell composition. Our measure of 
EEAA is defined using the following three steps. First, 
we calculated the epigenetic age measure from Hannum 
et al [2], which already correlated with certain blood 
cell types [5]. Second, we increased the contribution of 
immune blood cell types to the age estimate by forming 
a weighted average of Hannum’s estimate with 3 cell 
types that are known to change with age: naïve 
(CD45RA+CCR7+) cytotoxic T cells, exhausted 
(CD28-CD45RA-) cytotoxic T cells, and plasmablasts 
using the Klemera-Doubal approach [32]. The weights

 used in the weighted average are determined by the 
correlation between the respective variable and 
chronological age [32]. The weights were chosen on the 
basis of the WHI data. Thus, the same (static) weights 
were used for all data sets. EEAA was defined as the 
residual variation resulting from a univariate model 
regressing the resulting age estimate on chronological 
age. By construction, EEAA is positively correlated with 
the estimated abundance of exhausted CD8+ T cells, 
plasmablast cells, and a negative correlated with naive 
CD8+ T cells. Blood cell counts were estimated based 
on DNA methylation data as described in the next 
section. By construction, the measures of EEAA track 
both age related changes in blood cell composition and 
intrinsic epigenetic changes. None of our four measures 
of epigenetic age acceleration are correlated with 
chronological age. 
 
Estimating blood cell counts based on DNA 
methylation levels 
 
We estimate blood cell proportions using two different 
software tools. Houseman's estimation method [33], 
which is based on DNA methylation signatures from 
purified leukocyte samples, was used to estimate the 
proportions of cytotoxic (CD8+) T cells, helper (CD4+) 
T, natural killer, B cells, and granulocytes. The software 
does not allow us to identify the type of granulocytes in 
blood (neutrophil, eosinophil, or basophil) but we note 
that neutrophils tend to be the most abundant 
granulocyte (~60% of all blood cells compared with 
0.5-2.5% for eosinophils and basophils). To estimate the 
percentage of exhausted CD8+ T cells (defined as 
CD28-CD45RA-), plasmablasts, and the number 
(count) 
of 
naïve 
CD8+ 
T 
cells 
(defined 
as 
CD45RA+CCR7+), we used the "Horvath method" 
[25], which is implemented in the advanced analysis 
option of the epigenetic age calculator software [3]. We 
and others have shown that imputed blood cell counts 
have moderately high correlations with corresponding 
flow cytometric data, e.g. r=0.86 for naïve CD4+ T 
cells, r=0.68 for naïve CD8+T, and r=0.49 for 
exhausted CD8+ T cells [28]. 
 
Cox regression models and meta-analysis 
 
Here, we used Cox models for analyzing the censored 
survival time data (from the age at blood draw until age 
at death or last follow-up). We regressed the censored 
survival times on covariates using Cox regression 
models implemented in the R function coxph in the 
survival package. The resulting coefficient values 
(interpreted as log hazard ratios) and standard errors 
were combined using the R software package metafor 
[34]. The meta-analysis was carried out with the R 
command rma (with arguments method="FE" to get 
fixed effects estimates). The forest plots were created 
using the R function forest (with argument atransf=exp 
to exponentiate the estimate of the log hazard ratios). 
 
Sample exclusions 
 
In addition to cohort-specific quality checks, we further 
excluded individuals who had ever been diagnosed with 
leukemia 
(ICD-9: 
203-208), 
reported 
receiving 
chemotherapy, and whose methylation beta value 
distributions deviated substantially from a gold standard 
(according to the quality statistic corSampleVSgold 
standard<0.80 from the online age calculator [35–37]).
