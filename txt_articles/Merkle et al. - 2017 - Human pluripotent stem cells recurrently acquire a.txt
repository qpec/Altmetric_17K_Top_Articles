Abstract
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can self-renew indefinitely, making them an attractive 
source for regenerative therapies. This expansion potential has been linked with acquisition of 
large copy number variants (CNVs) that provide mutant cells with a growth advantage in culture1–
3. However, the nature, extent, and functional impact of other acquired genome sequence 
mutations in cultured hPSCs is not known. Here, we sequenced the protein-coding genes (exomes) 
of 140 independent human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines, including 26 lines prepared for 
potential clinical use4. We then applied computational strategies for identifying mutations present 
in a subset of cells5. Though such mosaic mutations were generally rare, we identified five 
unrelated hESC lines that carried six mutations in the TP53 gene that encodes the tumor 
suppressor P53. Notably, the TP53 mutations we observed are dominant negative and are the 
mutations most commonly seen in human cancers. We used droplet digital PCR to demonstrate 
that the TP53 mutant allelic fraction increased with passage number under standard culture 
conditions, suggesting that P53 mutation confers selective advantage. When we then mined 
published RNA sequencing data from 117 hPSC lines, we observed another nine TP53 mutations, 
all resulting in coding changes in the DNA binding domain of P53. Strikingly, in three lines, the 
allelic fraction exceeded 50%, suggesting additional selective advantage resulting from loss of 
heterozygosity at the TP53 locus. As the acquisition and favored expansion of cancer-associated 
mutations in hPSCs may go unnoticed during most applications, we suggest that careful genetic 
characterization of hPSCs and their differentiated derivatives should be carried out prior to clinical 
use.
Somatic mutations that arise during cell proliferation and are then subject to positive 
selection are major causes of cancer and other diseases6. Acquired mutations are often 
present in a subset of cells in a sample, and can therefore be detected in next generation 
sequencing data from their presence at allelic fractions less than 50%5,7. We reasoned that 
similar analysis of sequencing data from a large number of hESCs might reveal previously 
unappreciated mosaic mutations and mutation-driven expansions acquired during hESC 
culture at single-nucleotide resolution. This approach would complement previous studies 
describing culture-derived chromosomal-scale aneuploidies and megabase-scale CNVs in 
hPSCs1,8,9.
To this end, we sought to collect and perform whole exome sequencing (WES) of hESC 
lines that were derived under appropriate informed consent and were readily available for 
distribution (Fig. 1a). We therefore turned to the registry of hESC lines maintained by the 
US National Institutes of Health (NIH) (Fig. 1b) and were able to obtain, bank, and 
sequence 114 independent hESC lines (Fig. 1c-e). We selected cell lines at low to moderate 
passage numbers (mean P18, range P3-P37) and cultured them in a common set of growth 
conditions for an average of 2.7 ± 0.7 (± STD) passages (range 2-6 passages) prior to 
banking and sequencing (Fig. 1f,g). Since hESC-derived differentiated cells are currently

 being studied in clinical trials for their safety and utility in a range of diseases such as 
macular degeneration10, we also obtained genomic DNA from an additional 26 independent 
hESC lines that had been prepared under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions for 
potential clinical use (Fig. 1c,e,g). We performed WES of these 140 hESC lines from 19 
institutions to a mean read depth of 79.7 ± 0.1 (± SEM) (range 57 for UM4-6 to 115 for 
UM78-2) (Fig. 1h). Further details on cell line acquisition and selection can be found in 
Supplementary Table 1 and in Materials and Methods.
To identify potentially acquired mutations, we examined the number of sequencing reads at 
high-quality and high-coverage heterozygous sites across the exome. We observed that the 
allelic fractions for most variants followed a binomial distribution, reflecting statistical 
sampling around the 50% level expected of inherited alleles (Fig. 2a), as well as a much 
smaller set of sites where variant alleles were present at lower fractions (Fig. 2a,b). We 
applied a statistical test to identify variants for which the observed allelic fractions were 
unlikely (P<0.01 by binomial test) to have been generated by random sampling of two 
equally-present alleles. We found 263 candidate mosaic variants, of which 28 were predicted 
to have a damaging or disruptive effect on gene function (Supplementary Table 2).
The only gene affected by more than one such mutation was the tumor suppressor gene 
TP53. TP53 was affected by six of the 28 mutations, found in five unrelated hESC lines 
(Supplementary Table 3), including a GMP-prepared cell line (MShef10) that carried two 
distinct TP53 variants (G245S and R248W). These six missense mutations, while rare 
(<0.01%) in the general population11 (Fig. 2c), mapped to the four residues most frequently 
disrupted in human cancer (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Table 3)12–14. Since P53 is mutated in 
approximately 50% of tumors15, coding mutations in these four residues are associated with 
a substantial fraction of human cancer disease burden. Each of the six mutations involved a 
cytosine residue of a CpG dinucleotide and may therefore involve a highly mutable site16.
On a crystal structure of the human P53 protein complexed with DNA, each of the mutations 
mapped to the DNA-binding domain of P5317 (Fig. 2e,f). Mutations at these positions are 
associated with cancer and often act in a dominant negative fashion to substantially diminish 
P53’s regulation of apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and genomic stability18. Individuals 
with germ-line mutations at these residues develop Li-Fraumeni syndrome, an autosomal 
dominant disease with a lifetime cancer risk of nearly 100%19. In these patients, tumors can 
arise at any age and can affect most tissues, including the brain, bones, lung, skin, soft 
tissues, adrenal gland, colon, stomach, and blood20.
To independently test the hypothesis that the inactivating TP53 mutations were acquired 
during cell culture, we developed droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assays to digitally count the 
abundance of each allele at the four TP53 mutation sites (Fig. 3a,b, Supplementary Table 4). 
Analysis of genomic DNA derived from the 140 hESC lines confirmed that all six mutations 
identified by WES were indeed mosaic, with allelic factions ranging from 7-40%, suggesting 
their presence in 14-80% of cells in culture (Fig. 3c). We did not identify additional cell 
lines carrying mutations at these positions, suggesting they were either absent or present at 
allelic fractions below the sensitivity of the assay (approximately 0.1%)21. These findings 
demonstrate that each of the TP53 mutations identified in hESCs was an acquired mutation

 and that cells with the mutation had come to represent a significant fraction of cells in 
affected lines.
We next asked whether the cells harboring these TP53 mutations expanded their 
representation within the hESC population across passages. We re-obtained early passage 
vials for hESC lines that were mosaic for TP53 mutations (CHB11 at P22, and WA26 at 
P13), thawed a fresh vial of ESI035 at P36, and analyzed the genomic DNA from the frozen 
vial and at each subsequent passage to test for changes in mutant allelic fraction. In each of 
the three hESC lines, TP53 mutant alleles increased in representation over passages (Fig. 3d) 
in all but one experiment, suggesting these mutations conferred a strong selective advantage 
(approximately 1.9-fold/passage) under standard hESC culture conditions (Fig. 3e, Extended 
Data Figure 1, Supplementary Table 5). To confirm that this selective advantage was 
conferred by TP53 mutations and not by CNVs at Chr20q11.211–3, we analyzed all 140 
hESC lines using microarrays and found that none of the lines carrying TP53 mutations also 
carried the Chr20q CNV (Supplementary Table 6). Our overall results are consistent with a 
model in which positive selective pressure for clonal expansion of mutations that inactivate 
P53 are present during the routine culture of hPSCs. Indeed, it has previously been reported 
that loss of P53 activity facilitates the reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency22,23 
and promotes hPSC survival and proliferation24, suggesting a prominent role for P53 in 
regulating self-renewal in hPSCs (Fig. 3e).
To test the reproducibility of our observations and to explore the effects of P53 mutations in 
additional contexts, we screened for TP53 mutations in publically available RNA sequencing 
data from 251 hPSC samples in 57 published studies, corresponding to 13 hESC and 104 
hiPSC lines (Fig. 4a-c, Supplementary Table 7). The relatively high expression of TP53 in 
stem cells provided sufficient read depth for allelic counting and allowed us to identify nine 
instances of eight distinct point mutations in TP53, three of which we had independently 
seen by WES. Like the mutations ascertained by WES, each of these eight mutations led to 
missense substitutions in the DNA-binding domain of P53 (Fig. 4d-f, Supplementary Table 
3, Extended Data Figure 2). When we considered both WES and RNAseq data sets, we 
identified four codons that were recurrently mutated in hPSCs: R181, G245, R248, and 
R273. Notably, we identified four distinct TP53 mutations in the commonly used WA09 
(H9) hESC line grown in different laboratories (P151S, R181H, R248Q, and R267W) 
indicating that the mutations arose during cell culture (Fig. 4h).
Of the 15 instances of TP53 mutations observed by either WES or RNAseq, the percentage 
of mutant reads suggested that 10 were mosaic and that three had reached fixation (50% of 
allelic fraction). Surprisingly, two cell lines, WA09 (R248Q) and WIBR3 (H193R) had 80% 
± 3% and 100% mutant reads, respectively (Supplementary Table 3). These findings were 
consistent with the excess allelic fraction observed during the culture of WA26 (Fig. 3d) and 
suggested the presence of additional mutational mechanisms affecting mutant TP53 allelic 
fraction. Indeed, we observed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of a large telomeric domain 
including the TP53 locus along chromosome 17 (Extended Data Figure 3) that was almost 
complete in a gene-targeted derivative of WIBR3 (Fig. 4i), and was partial in WA09, 
consistent with the observed high fraction (80%) of mutant TP53 reads. These results 
Merkle et al.

 suggest that follow-on LOH after an initial TP53 point mutation likely confers additional 
selective advantage.
We next asked if TP53 mutations might affect cell differentiation or affect the survival of 
differentiated cells. To this end, we examined studies for which there was RNA sequencing 
data for both hESCs and their differentiated progeny. Cell lines with substantial factions of 
TP53 mutant cells could readily form teratomas, gut epithelial cells25 (Fig. 4i), 
neuroepithelial cells26 (Fig. 4j), and pancreatic polyhormonal cells27 (Fig. 4k). Notably, a 
hESC line harboring a mosaic G245C mutation expanded its mutant allelic fraction over the 
course of differentiation27, suggesting a continued selective advantage in differentiating 
mutant cells.
Together, our analyses indicate that researchers have unknowingly and routinely used hPSCs 
that harbor cancer-related missense mutations in TP53, sometimes accompanied with LOH. 
These findings have practical implications for the use of hESCs in disease modeling and 
transplantation medicine. The fact that we observed TP53 mutations among both hESC and 
hiPSCs cultured with a wide variety of media, substrates, and passaging methods (Extended 
Data Figure 4) suggests that new culture conditions should be explored to reduce the 
selective pressure for TP53 mutations. We also suggest that hPSCs should be regularly 
subjected to genetic testing, particularly before and after stressful interventions such as gene 
editing or single-cell cloning that force hPSC populations through bottlenecks (Fig. 4l,m). 
Our specific findings here suggest that the P53 pathway should be an immediate focus for 
these genetic tests. However, a comprehensive ascertainment of recurrent culture-acquired 
mutations will require the analysis of still-larger collections of stem cell lines by both exome 
and whole genome sequencing.
Our findings also demonstrate that sequencing tests provide an opportunity to detect 
potentially harmful mutations in differentiated cell preparations derived from hPSCs, 
thereby increasing the safety of cell replacement therapies for conditions ranging from 
diabetes to Parkinson’s disease. In support of this notion, clinical trials with hPSC-derived 
materials have recently been halted due to the discovery of undisclosed mutations28, but 
have since resumed. We suggest that hPSCs and their derivatives be subjected to genome-
wide analyses at several key steps: during initial cell line selection, as part of the 
characterization of a master bank of hPSCs, and as an end-stage release criterion prior to the 
transplantation of the hPSC-derived cellular product. Importantly, although TP53 mutations 
recurred at detectable fractions in several cell lines, most lines (~95%) were free of 
detectable TP53 mutations despite having spent extensive time in culture. Regenerative 
medicine remains a viable and exciting goal that is more likely to succeed as potential 
pitfalls, like the one we report here, are identified and addressed.

hESC acquisition
As a source of hESCs for this study, we focused on those that had been voluntarily listed by 
research institutions on the registry of hESC lines maintained by the US National Institutes 
of Health (NIH) (http://grants.nih.gov/stem_cells/registry/current.htm). As of July 8, 2015, a

 total of 307 hESC lines were listed on this registry. Of these, we requested viable frozen 
stocks of the 182 lines annotated to be available for distribution and to lack known 
karyotypic abnormalities or disease-causing mutations. During our effort to obtain these cell 
lines, we found that 45 were subject to overly restrictive material transfer agreements that 
precluded their use in our studies and 11 could not be readily obtained as frozen stocks due 
to differences in human subjects research regulations between the U.S. and the U.K. Nine 
cell lines were unavailable upon request or were overly difficult to import, and three could 
not be cultured despite repeated attempts. Further details on the availability of cell lines can 
be found in Supplementary Table 1.
The generation of hESCs used in this study was previously approved by the institutional 
review boards (IRBs) of all providing institutions and reviewed by either the United States 
National Institutes of Health (US-NIH) or the United Kingdom Stem Cell Steering 
Committee (UK-SCSC) as all cell lines used in this study were listed on the US-NIH 
Embryonic Stem Cell Registry or UK Stem Cell Registry. Use of the hESCs for sequencing 
at Harvard was further approved and determined not to constitute Human Subjects Research 
by the Committee on the Use of Human Subjects in Research at Harvard University.
hESC culture
In a separate document, we describe in detail a protocol for the adaptation of hESC lines 
from diverse culture conditions (xxxxxx Reference to Nature Protocol Exchange paper once 
this DOI is generated). Briefly, we considered that different laboratories employ different 
methods to culture hESCs, raising the question of how best to thaw and culture the cell lines 
we obtained from multiple sources. Traditionally, hESCs are maintained on gelatinized 
plates and co-cultured with replication-incompetent mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) 
feeder cells in tissue culture medium containing knockout serum replacement (KOSR). More 
recently, hESCs have been cultured on a substrate of cell line-derived basal membrane 
proteins known by the trade names of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) or Geltrex (Life 
Technologies), in mTeSR129, E830, or similar in the absence of feeder cells. In previous 
work, we found that a medium containing an equal volume of KOSR-based hESC medium 
(KSR) and mTeSR1 (STEMCELL Technologies) (KSR:mTeSR1) robustly supports the 
pluripotency of hESCs undergoing antibiotic selection during the course of gene targeting 
experiments under feeder-free conditions31. To minimize stress to hESCs previously 
cultured and frozen under diverse conditions, cell lines were thawed in the presence of 10 
μM Y-27632 (DNSK International) into two wells of a 6-well plate, one of which contained 
KSR:mTeSR1 on a substrate of Matrigel, and the other containing KOSR-based hESC 
medium on a monolayer of irradiated MEFs. After 24 hours, Y-27632 was removed and cells 
were fed daily with the aforementioned media in the absence of any antibiotics. All cultures 
were tested for the presence of mycoplasma and cultured in a humidified 37°C tissue culture 
incubator in the presence of 5% CO2 and 20% O2.
Colonies of cells with hESC morphology and with a diameter of approximately 400-1000 
micrometers were transferred into KSR:mTeSR1 medium containing 10 μM Y-27632 on a 
substrate of Matrigel by manual picking under a dissecting microscope. Cells with 
differentiated morphology were removed from plates by aspiration during feeding. Once

 cultures consisting of cells with homogeneous pluripotent stem cell morphology had been 
established, they were passaged by brief (2-10 minute) incubation in 0.5 mM EDTA in PBS 
followed by gentle trituration in KSR:mTeSR1 medium containing 10 μM Y-27632 and re-
plating. Once cultures had reached approximately 90% confluence in one well of a 6 well 
plate, they were passaged with ETDA onto a Matrigel-coated 10 cm plate. Upon reaching 
approximately 90% confluence, cell lines were dissociated with EDTA as described above 
and banked for later use in cryoprotective medium containing 50% KSR:mTeSR1, 10 μM 
Y-27632, 10% DMSO, and 40% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). A subset of hESC lines 
(Supplementary Table 1) were passaged enzymatically with TrypLE Express (Life 
Technologies), expanded onto two 15 cm plates, and frozen down in 25 cryovials.
Whole exome sequencing and genotyping
Cell pellets of approximately 1-5 million cells were generated from banked cryovials of 
research-grade hESC lines, or were obtained directly from institutions providing GMP-grade 
hESC lines. Cell pellets were digested overnight at 50°C in 500 μl lysis buffer containing 
100 μg/ml proteinase K (Roche), 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 200 mM NaCl, 5% w/v SDS, 10 mM 
EDTA, followed by Phenol:Chloroform precipitation, ethanol washes, and resuspension in 
10 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0). Genomic DNA was then transferred to the Genomics Platform 
at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard for Illumina Nextera library preparation, quality 
control, and sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Sequencing reads (150 bp, 
paired-end) were aligned to the hg19 reference genome using the BWA alignment program. 
Genotypes from WES data for the cell lines were computed using best practices from GATK 
software32 compiled July 31, 2015. Sequencing quality and coverage were analyzed using 
Picard tool metrics. Cross sample contamination was estimated using VerifyBamID 
(v1.1.2)33. Data from each cell line was independently processed with the HaplotypeCaller 
walker and further aggregated with the CombineGVCFs and GenotypeGVCFs walkers to 
generate a combined variant call format (VCF) file. Genotyped sites were finally filtered 
using the ApplyRecalibration walker.
To determine whether lines with or without acquired TP53 mutations show other 
chromosomal aberrations or smaller regional changes in copy number, additional genotyping 
of the 140 hESC lines was performed using a custom high density SNP array (“Human 
Psych array”) that contains more than half a million SNPs across the genome. CNVs larger 
than 500 kb were identified using the PennCNV (v1.0.0)34 tool 
(penncnv.openbioinformatics.org). All CNVs were manually reviewed and are shown in 
Supplementary Table 6.
Mosaic variant analysis
To identify candidate mosaic variants, a table of heterozygous variants was generated from 
the VCF (Supplementary Table 2). To limit the frequency of false positive calls due to 
sequencing artifacts and PCR errors, variants were included if they had a variant read depth 
(DP) of at least 10, if they were either flagged as a “PASS” site or were not reported in the 
Exome Aggregation Consortium’s (ExAC) database11, and if they were not located in 
regions of the genome with low sequence complexity, common large insertions and 
segmental duplications, as described by Genovese and colleagues5. Multiallelic sites were

 split, left-aligned, and normalized. The resulting list of 2.1 million “high-quality 
heterozygous variants” was further refined to include sites that were covered by at least 60 
unique reads and had a high confidence variant score (“PASS”) as ascertained by GATK’s 
Variant Quality Score Recalibration software (840,222 variants). To exclude common 
inherited variants we selected variants present in less than 0.01% of the (ExAC) control 
population and restricted our analysis to only singleton or doubleton variants (9490 variants 
present in 1-2 of the 140 samples). Coverage was calculated by summing reference and 
alternate allele counts for each variant. Allelic fraction (AF) was calculated by dividing the 
alternate allele count by the total read coverage (both alleles) of the site.
Although the allelic fraction of inherited heterozygous variants is expected to be 50%, 
reference capture bias (a tendency of hybrid selection to capture the reference allele more 
efficiently than alternative alleles) causes the actual expected allele fraction for SNPs and 
indels to be closer to 45% and 35% respectively5. To account for these technical biases, we 
used a binomial test with a null model centered at 45% allelic fraction for inherited SNPs 
and 35% for inherited indels. Variants for which this binomial test was nominally significant 
(P < 0.01) were deemed to be candidate mosaic variants. The nominal P-value threshold of 
0.01 was chosen as an inclusive threshold in order to screen sensitively for potentially 
mosaic variants, at the expense of also capturing false positives for which low allelic 
fractions represented statistical sampling fluctuations. For this reason, we considered it 
important to further evaluate putative mosaic variants by independent molecular methods 
that deeply sample alleles at the nominated sites (Figure 3). A much more stringent 
computational screen based on a P-value threshold of 10-7 identified three of the six TP53 
variants, and TP53 was also the only gene with multiple putatively mosaic variants in this 
screen.
We also identified all high quality heterozygous variants that passed the inclusive statistical 
threshold of (P<0.01) in our binomial test and could potentially be mosaic (n=36,396). 
These data are included in Supplementary Table 2.
Variant annotation was performed using SnpEff with GRCh37.75 Ensembl gene models. 
Variants with moderate impact were classified as damaging by a consensus model based on 
seven in silico prediction algorithms35.
Assessment of TP53 mutation frequency in cancer
We turned to the ExAC database11 that complies the whole exome sequences of over 60,000 
individuals to assess the frequency at which the amino acid residues we observed to be 
mutated in some hESCs were affected in the general population. We then consulted the 
COSMIC (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/gene/analysis?ln=TP53)12, ICGC (https://
cbioportal.gdc.cancer.gov/cbioportal/)13, and IARC P53 (http://p53.iarc.fr/
TP53SomaticMutations.aspx)14 databases and plotted the percent of tumors carrying a 
mutation in each codon (Fig. 2d, Extended Data Figure 2b).
Molecular modeling of P53 protein
To visualize the spatial location of the amino acid residues affected by TP53 mutations 
observed in hESCs by WES on the P53 protein, we downloaded the 1.85 Angstrom X-ray

 diffraction based structure file from the Research Collaboratory for Structural 
Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (file 2AHI) and built the model protein/DNA system 
(Chain IDs D, G, and H) to visualise the secondary structure of a P53 monomer complexed 
to DNA as a ribbon diagram. DNA was illustrated as a space-filling model. Water molecules 
were discarded when building the wild-type model and minimized in two steps using the 
AMBER 16 package36. Affected residues were indicated as space-filling model 
superimposed on the ribbon diagram of P53 and highlighted in blue (wild-type) or red 
(mutated) without consideration of how the mutations might affect the secondary or tertiary 
structure of the protein.
Measurement of TP53 variant allele fraction by ddPCR
We assayed the allelic fraction of the four distinct TP53 mutations identified by WES 
(Supplementary Table 3) in the 140 hESC lines by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Each 
ddPCR analysis incorporated a custom TaqMan assay (IDT). Assays were designed with 
Primer3Plus and consisted of a primer pair and a 5’ fluorescently labeled probe (HEX or 
FAM) with 3’ quencher (Iowa Black with Zen) for either the control (reference) or mutant 
(alternative) base for each identified P53 variant (Supplementary Table 4). Genomic DNA 
from each hESC line was analyzed by ddPCR according to the manufacturer’s protocol 
(BioRad). The frequency of each allele for a given sample was estimated first by Poisson 
correction of the endpoint fluorescence reads21. These corrected counts were then converted 
to fractional abundance estimates of the mutant allele and multiplied by two to determine the 
fraction of cells carrying the variant allele.
Longitudinal hESC culture and calculation of TP53 mutation expansion
To assess how the allelic fraction of TP53 mutations might change over time in culture, 
hESC lines CHB11 (passage 22 or 25), WA26 (passage 13 or 15), and ESI035 (passage 36 
in two separate experiments) were serially passaged in mTeSR1 media (STEMCELL 
Technologies) at a density of approximately 30,000 cells/cm2 in the presence of 10 μM 
Y-27632. Cells were fed daily with mTeSR1 and passaged with Accutase (Innovative Cell 
Technologies Inc.) at approximately 90% confluence. To monitor changes in allelic 
fractions, genomic DNA from cells at the indicated passages were analyzed by ddPCR. To 
calculate the relative expansion rate of mutant relative to wild-type cells, we applied the 
following formula:
where R0 is defined as the ratio of (variant positive cells)/(variant negative cells) after some 
number of starting passages and R1 and R2 represent the aforementioned ratios measured on 
the same sample at T1 and T2>T1 passages respectively. From this equation, the estimation 
of variant positive cells after t passages from starting ratio R0 can be defined as

 Note that this equation estimates the relative growth rate of cells carrying the variant allele 
with a round of passaging as unit of time, with both relative survival and growth being 
incorporated. These data are included in Supplementary Table 5. For the subsequent 
calculation of the earliest passage at which these mutations might have become detectable, 
the detection thresholds (R0) for WES and ddPCR was assumed to be 0.1 (10/100 reads) and 
0.001 (1 per 1000 droplets), respectively.
RNA sequencing analysis
In order to identify P53 mutations in hPSCs, we analyzed 256 publicly available high-
throughput RNA sequencing samples of hPSCs from the SRA database (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra)37. Data accession numbers for SRA (and GEO, where 
applicable) are provided in Supplementary Table 7. Five of these 256 samples were not 
considered further as they were from single cells rather than cell lines. Following sequence 
alignment to the hg19 reference genome with Tophat238, single nucleotides divergent from 
the reference genome were identified using GATK HaplotypeCaller32. As sufficient 
sequencing-depth is required to deduce sequence mutation, a threshold of 25 reads per 
nucleotide was set. Under this criterion, 43 samples (40 hESC and 3 hiPSC) had a missense 
mutation in TP53. 10 of the 40 hESC samples (WA09) carried two separate mutations 
(Supplementary Table 7). Upon the identification of cell lines carrying mutant reads, RNA 
sequencing data from studies containing differentiated samples were included for analysis.
Loss of heterozygosity analysis
In order to evaluate TP53 alleles, we assessed the level of polymorphism by calculating the 
ratio between the minor and major alleles across chromosome 17. In order to minimize 
sequencing noise and errors, we included SNPs covered by more than 10 reads and that are 
located in the dbSNP build 142 database39. The resulted wig files were then plotted using 
Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)40 (Extended Data Figure 4). In order to quantify the 
difference in polymorphism between samples, we converted the wig files to BigWig using 
UCSC Genome Browser utilities41 and summed the allelic ratios between the distal part of 
the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p), the proximal side of this arm and the long arm of 
chromosome 17 (17q). The allelic ratio sum was then divided by the region's length (bp), 
which resulted in the proportion of SNPs, followed by one-sided Z score test for two 
population proportion to compare between the chromosome 17 areas within each sample. 
While most samples with mutations in TP53 showed a comparable, non-significant rate of 
polymorphic sites along the chromosome, WIBR3 samples with H193R mutations and 
WA09 samples with both P151S and R248Q mutations had a significantly different 
proportion (p<0.001) of polymorphic sites, in the distal part of the short arm of the 
chromosome (first 16x106 base pairs), including TP53 site. Unlike the three mutant WIBR3 
samples, the wild-type WIBR3 sample had a normal distribution of polymorphic sites with 
no significant difference between the short and long arms.

Note that while the mutant allelic fractions for lines CHB11 and WA26 approach fixation, 
that the fraction of mutant cells unexpectedly decreases for ESI035 over several passages, 
indicating a potential selective disadvantage that co-segregates with the TP53 mutation in 
this experiment. The number of replicate wells is indicated in each graph. Error bars depict

Extended Data Figure 4. Culture and passaging method employed for samples bearing P53 
mutations.
a, P53 mutations were observed in hPSCs grown in a broad array of culture media including 
home-made medium supplemented with knockout serum replacement (KOSR), and defined, 
commercial media such as E8. b, Similar numbers of P53 mutations were observed from 
cells grown with feeder cells or under feeder-free conditions. c, Since passaging hPSCs can 
introduce stresses or clonal bottlenecks, we examined whether P53 mutations were 
consistently seen when a particular passaging method was used, but we observed a wide 
variety of passaging methods associated with these mutations. Note that the interpretation of 
these data are complicated by the fact that the culture methods employed in the final 
published study may not reflect the previous culture history of that cell line, which may have 
previously passed through multiple laboratories, as well as by the lack of detail about culture 
methods present in some published studies. d, The addition of supplements such as rock 
inhibitor at passages does not appear to be sufficient to prevent P53 mutations in hPSCs.
