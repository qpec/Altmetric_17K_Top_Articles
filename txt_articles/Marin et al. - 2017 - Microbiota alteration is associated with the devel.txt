Depressive disorders often run in families, which, in addition to the genetic component, may point to 
the microbiome as a causative agent. Here, we employed a combination of behavioral, molecular and 
computational techniques to test the role of the microbiota in mediating despair behavior. In chronically 
stressed mice displaying despair behavior, we found that the microbiota composition and the metabolic 
signature dramatically change. Specifically, we observed reduced Lactobacillus and increased 
circulating kynurenine levels as the most prominent changes in stressed mice. Restoring intestinal 
Lactobacillus levels was sufficient to improve the metabolic alterations and behavioral abnormalities. 
Mechanistically, we identified that Lactobacillus-derived reactive oxygen species may suppress 
host kynurenine metabolism, by inhibiting the expression of the metabolizing enzyme, IDO1, in the 
intestine. Moreover, maintaining elevated kynurenine levels during Lactobacillus supplementation 
diminished the treatment benefits. Collectively, our data provide a mechanistic scenario for how a 
microbiota player (Lactobacillus) may contribute to regulating metabolism and resilience during stress.
Depression is one of the most common types of mental illnesses, affecting up to 7% of the population1,2. While 
improved diagnosis led to appreciation of the frequency of the disorder, better understanding of the mechanisms 
leading to depression is needed for the development of new therapeutic approaches for this debilitating dis-
ease. Based on both human and animal studies, several hypotheses have been proposed to underlie the etiology 
of depression, including monoamine deficiency, stress response dysregulation, neuronal plasticity deficits, and 
inflammation1–3. Genetic polymorphisms have also been linked to an increased risk for developing depression2. 
However, their prevalence cannot account for the frequency and familial nature of the disorder. Family history 
can also be viewed as having a “shared environment”
, i.e. a shared microbiota composition. Therefore, we decided 
to explore the role of the gut microbiota in the development and maintenance of depressive behavior.
The microbiota, the collection of organisms inhabiting various organs, has been increasingly recognized to 
modulate host physiology4. Changes in gut microbiota composition have been linked to CNS function in ani-
mal models and human studies. In most studies, germ free mice show a decreased anxiety phenotype, but an 
exacerbated response to stress, and have numerous neurochemical disturbances5–9. Alteration of gut microbiota 
composition in despair and anxiety disorders has long been suspected from clinical observations, such as high 
co-morbidities of colitis and depression10–12.
In this study, we set out to understand whether and how microbiota alterations contribute to CNS dysfunc-
tion and behavioral abnormalities and whether the gut microbiota could be therapeutically targeted to alleviate 
depression. Here, we show that chronic stress significantly alters intestinal microbiota composition, primarily 
depleting the Lactobacillus compartment. ROS produced by Lactobacilli can inhibit kynurenine metabolism, a 
pathway that can negatively impact the brain when dysregulated. Surprisingly, therapeutic administration of 
 
L. reuteri to stressed mice improves metabolic homeostasis and corrects stress-induced despair behaviors.

Results
Microbiota composition is altered by unpredictable chronic mild stress. 
To determine whether 
chronic stress can directly affect the microbiota, we chose the unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) model 
to induce despair behavior13,14. Considering the dynamic nature of the intestinal microbiota, we posited that last-
ing changes must be observed over a prolonged period of time (e.g. weeks-months). The UCMS model seemed 
particularly appropriate due to the length and variety of the stress protocol (Fig. 1a). Consistent with previous 
reports, this protocol effectively induced despair behavior, as measured by the forced swim test (t(19) = 
 3.343, 
Welch’s correction applied, p = 0.0034; Fig. 1b)3,15,16. The assay measures the amount of time an animal struggles 
to escape an uncomfortable situation, a behavior typically affected in most models of depression and corrected 
by anti-depressant treatment. We verified that the forced swim test results were true despair behavior, as the 
animals show normal activity and locomotion in the open field test (Sup. Fig. 1a,b). The UCMS protocol did not 
significantly impact the weight and the food intake of stressed mice when compared to the control group (Sup. 
Fig. 1c,d).
In order to assess the changes in microbiota composition that occur during chronic stress, we performed 16S 
rRNA sequencing on genomic DNA isolated from the fecal samples of naïve and stressed mice. The quantity of 
bacterial DNA in fecal pellets was not affected by stress, as demonstrated by 16S qPCR (t(33) = 0.4447, p = 6594; 
Fig. 1c). In terms of microbiota composition, principal coordinate analysis shows distinct clustering between 
samples from naïve and stressed mice, indicative of differences between the groups (Fig. 1d). A more in-depth 
taxonomic analysis of bacterial types revealed several changes in the microbiota composition (Fig. 1e shows one 
experimental cohort, Sup. Fig. 2 shows a different experimental cohort; bacterial classes are shown for ease of 
visualization). In our sequencing runs we observed between 14 and 29 significantly different genera between 
the naïve and stressed conditions. The variability in the starting microbiota (of naïve mice) and its changes (after 
stress) is not unexpected, as different shipments of mice, even from the same vendor, can have different micro-
biota compositions17,18. Overall, the most conserved microbiota change across all independent experiments was 
a decrease in bacillus class members in stressed mice (Fig. 1e, Sup. Fig. 2a). This class encompasses Lactobacillus 
and Turicibacter, and the decrease was also detectable at the genus level (Sup. Fig. 2b). Due to the abundance of 
literature linking Lactobacilli and behavior and the lack of studies and tools regarding Turicibacter species, we

further focused on Lactobacillus as a confident potential player in the despair phenotype. We verified the net 
loss of Lactobacilli by qPCR (t(19) = 
 4.103, Welch’s correction applied, p = 
 0.0006; Fig. 2a) and selective fecal 
sample cultures using MRS agar supplemented with azide (t(9) = 
 2.993, Welch’s correction applied, p = 
 0.0157; 
Sup. Fig. 3a,b)19. These results demonstrate that chronic stress disturbs the microbiota homeostasis, in particular 
by decreasing the Lactobacillus levels. Correlation analysis returned a positive correlation (Spearman r = 0.5246, 
p = 
 0.0122) between the relative Lactobacillus load and the escape behavior displayed by a mouse (Fig. 2b). Our 
observation was not limited to C57BL/6J, as BALB/cJ and C57BL/6N mice also show significant correlation 
(Spearman r = 0.4682, p = 0.0012) between Lactobacillus levels and their escape behavior (Fig. 2c). Interestingly, 
C57BL/6N mice had very low starting levels of Lactobacillus, which corresponded to low escape behavior even 
in the absence of stress. Our data are in agreement with recent studies showing associations between lower 
Lactobacillus levels and stress20,21.
To gain insight into potential causes for changed microbiota composition, we further characterized intestinal 
physiology and immunity. Similarly to previous reports using stress models22,23, large intestinal transit time was 
significantly decreased in the stressed animals (t(19) = 
 4.275, Welch’s correction applied, p = 
 0.0004; Sup. Fig. 4a). 
 
Furthermore, we observed an increase in the total size and cellular content of the stressed small intestines 
(t(22) = 
 3.574, p = 
 0.0017; t(22) = 
 2.248, p = 
 0.0349; Sup. Fig. 4b,c). These changes in intestinal physiology in 
response to stress may underlie microbiota changes.
Treatment with a Lactobacillus species ameliorates despair behavior by restoring kynurenine 
metabolism. 
To assess whether Lactobacillus levels may play a role in mediating despair behaviors, we 
attempted to replenish the levels of the bacteria and then measure escape behavior. To this end, we subjected 
mice to the UCMS protocol for three weeks and then supplemented their diet with live cultures of L. reuteri, while 
continuing the stress protocol for additional 4 weeks (Fig. 3a). Lactobacillus reuteri (ATCC 23272) is a species 
that colonizes several vertebrate hosts, including rodents and humans, and was shown to improve despair and 
anxiety-like behaviors, including the forced swim test in mice24,25. This regimen indeed elevated Lactobacillus 
levels in the stressed mice (Fig. 3b, t(8) = 
 3.330, p = 
 0.0104). The increase in overall Lactobacillus was not due 
to a re-expansion of endogenous bacteria, but due to L. reuteri supplementation (Sup. Fig. 5). Moreover, in 
our experimental paradigm, L. reuteri supplementation ameliorated the despair behavior induced by UCMS 
(Fig. 3c, Fstress(1, 32) = 
 8.569, p = 
 0.0062; Finteraction(1, 32) = 
 3.005, p = 
 0.0926; Bonferroni post-hoc tbroth = 
 3.96, 
tL.reuteri = 
 0.8441). L. reuteri also improved the compulsive behavior observed in stressed mice, as measured by 
the nestlet shredding test (Fig. 3d, Fstress(1, 31) = 
 13.7, p = 
 0.0008; Ftreatment(1, 31) = 
 5.508, p = 
 0.0255; Bonferroni 
post-hoc tbroth = 
 3.861, tL.reuteri = 
 1.412). These data indicate that Lactobacillus levels may be mediating, at least in 
part, the depressive-like behavior.

To get an insight into the potential mechanism of Lactobacillus-supported resiliency, we performed untargeted 
metabolomics analysis of serum samples to identify if and how metabolites composition was altered after chronic 
stress. Principal component analysis showed that the metabolic profile of stressed mice is clustered distinctly 
from that of naïve mice (Fig. 3ei). Treatment with L. reuteri modified the metabolic profile of stressed mice to an 
intermediate profile, suggesting that some of the stress associated metabolic alterations may be a consequence of 
decreased Lactobacillus levels, while others may be a direct effect of L. reuteri administration (Fig. 3eii). While 
several molecules were significantly different in our analysis (234 out of 4900 spectra), most returned spectra 
were not confidently matched to known molecules due to limitations in the metabolite library (Sup. Fig. 6). Of 
the identified compounds, we mined those increased in stressed animals and normalized by L. reuteri treatment. 
Among them, metabolites in the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway presented this pattern (Fig. 3f, F(2, 53) = 
 12.13, 
p < 0.0001). Evidence of dysregulation of this pathway in depressed patients, as well as its recently described role 
in the initiation of despair behaviors26, have made the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway particularly compelling 
as part of the potential mechanism mediating the microbiome effects on behavior. IDO1 is the main enzyme 
metabolizing L-tryptophan to kynurenine outside of the liver (where TDO is the primary enzyme)27. The effects 
of Lactobacillus strains on ido1 expression remain unclear. While it appears that in the context of inflammatory 
disease several Lactobacillus strains can increase IDO1 expression or activity28,29, in other models Lactobacillus 
administration dampens it30,31. Intriguingly, a recent study32 showed that, at steady state, Lactobacillus admin-
istration can directly modulate kynurenine metabolism, by inhibiting the pathway initiating enzyme IDO1 via 
production of reactive oxygen species (i.e. H2O2, summarized in Fig. 4a).
To further explore this question in our study, we verified that cultured L. reuteri produced a significant amount 
of H2O2 in vitro, when compared to E.coli, a negative control that does not produce H2O2 (Fig. 4b, t(4) = 
 208.2, 
p < 
 0.0001). In addition, we also compared the ROS production from L. reuteri with that of endogenous 
Lactobacillus in Jackson C57BL6 mice, L. johnsonii, and observed they were comparable (Fig. 4c and Sup. Fig. 3c, 
Tuckey’s posthoc q = 
 1.592, p = 
 0.51). L. murinus, the endogenous Lactobacillus found in Taconic C57BL6/N mice 
was also included for comparison. We next measured peroxide levels in the fecal contents of the stressed mice and 
discovered that H2O2 levels were decreased in the stressed mice; more importantly, and in agreement with our 
hypothesis, therapeutic administration of L. reuteri significantly raised the level of H2O2 in vivo (F(2, 25) = 9.907, 
p = 
 0.0007, Fig. 4d). Moreover, we observed a significant correlation between the drop in Lactobacillus levels 
and the levels of H2O2 (Fig. 4e, Spearman r = 
 0.7818, p = 
 0.0105). We further verified the kynurenine pathway

dysregulation by probing for ido1 mRNA in the intestine. Our results show increased ido1 expression in the intes-
tines after stress, which is decreased after L. reuteri treatment (Fstress(2, 14) = 7.274, p = 0.0068), in accordance to 
the effects observed on ROS production (Fig. 4f). To further investigate the causative role of kynurenine metab-
olism in mediating despair behavior we treated naïve mice with L-kynurenine daily (i.p., Fig. 4g) and observed 
a significant reduction in escape behavior (t(16) = 
 2.861, Welch’s correction applied, p = 
 0.0113) at the end of 
the 4-week protocol (Fig. 4h). Moreover, in order to show that the benefit of Lactobacillus supplementation is by 
reducing kynurenine level, we treated stressed mice simultaneously with L.reuteri and L-kynurenine, expecting 
kynurenine to bypass the benefits of L.reuteri supplementation. Indeed, while L. reuteri alone increased the escape 
behavior of stressed mice, kynurenine administration abrogated the beneficial effect of L.reuteri (F(2, 18) = 
 8.632, 
p = 0.0024; Fig. 4i), even with elevated levels of Lactobacillus and H2O2 (Sup. Fig. 7a,b).
Discussion
Taken together, our results demonstrate that microbiome homeostasis was robustly altered in animals undergoing 
UCMS, with a consistent decrease in Lactobacilli. This finding was shared across three strains of mice (C57BL/6J, 
as BALB/cJ and C57BL/6N). Moreover, our data suggest that the production of H2O2 by Lactobacillus may be pro-
tective against the development of despair behavior by direct inhibition of intestinal ido1 expression and decrease 
in the circulating level of kynurenine, a metabolite associated with depression26.
Our results are in agreement with recent literature demonstrating that microbiome composition is modified 
with acute and chronic stress20,33,34. Microbiome dysbiosis is also detected in humans affected by major depressive 
disorders and the transplantation of the biota from these patients in germ free mice can induce despair behavior9. 
Beyond describing microbiome fluctuation as a consequence of UCMS, we further demonstrated that levels of 
Lactobacillus correlate with the susceptibility to and severity of despair behaviors. Indeed, animals exhibiting 
low (i.e. Taconic C57BL/6N mice) intestinal Lactobacillus levels present with a basal despair phenotype, when 
compared to animals with higher levels of Lactobacillus (i.e. Jackson C57BL/6J mice). Accordingly, therapeutic 
administration of a probiotic Lactobacillus species during UCMS was sufficient to improve the despair symptoms.

Further works will be needed to explore the role of other populations of bacteria affected by UCMS, as well as 
Lactobacillus strain differences and their abilities to improve behavior.
Recently, members of the Lactobacillus genus have been shown to affect a multitude of aspects of human 
physiology, as they colonize several sites of the body, including the skin, the vagina, and the entirety of the gas-
trointestinal tract, starting with the oral cavity35. Perhaps best studied in the vagina, Lactobacilli protect against 
infection by producing a diversity of antimicrobial factors, including lactic acid, peroxide, bacteriocins, as well 
as by resource competition35–37. Although in a few contexts increased levels of Lactobacilli are associated with 
pathology, e.g. dental cavities38, the bacteria are largely non-pathogenic or beneficial. From dysbioses or probiotic 
studies, Lactobacilli are associated with protection against infection, improved recovery after enteric infections, 
decreased colitis pathology, and better cognitive function25,39–41.
While Lactobacilli are able to control other microbial communities through secretion of antimicrobial factors, 
genetic limitations make them more sensitive to environmental conditions. In particular, many Lactobacillus 
genus members are unable to synthesize amino acids and purines and thus rely on nutrient rich environments 
and other bacteria for supply of essential building blocks42–45. We hypothesize that, in the context of a faster 
intestinal transit, such as the one observed in stressed animals, fluctuating availability of nutrients and symbiotic 
bacteria will impact the renewal of the Lactobacillus niche46. Further studies will be able to determine whether 
there is indeed a causal relationship between increased intestinal motility and microbiota alteration in the context 
of stress, or rather if the dysbiosis induced during stress causes altered intestinal physiology.
We found that the level of kynurenine is increased after chronic stress, in a manner dependent on Lactobacillus 
levels. Kynurenine can readily cross the blood-brain barrier to drive depression within the CNS by disrupting 
neurotransmitter balance and driving neuroinflammation27,47. A recent study by Agudelo et al.26 identified this 
pathway as also being disrupted in stressed mice using the same model of UCMS. Taken together, these new 
findings point to disruptions in tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism as an important factor in mediating despair 
behavior. IDO1 is the main enzyme responsible for conversion of tryptophan to kynurenine outside of the liver, 
and its expression and activity can be directly inhibited by reactive oxygen species (ROS)32. Members of the 
Lactobacillus family have the capacity to produce high levels of ROS, as a means of maintaining their niche36,37. In 
our study, we have shown that decreased levels of ROS in stressed animals correlate with an increase in intestinal 
ido1 transcripts, thus potentially explaining our observed increase in circulating kynurenine. Moreover, several 
studies have shown that inhibiting IDO1 activity (such as with the small molecule 1-methyl tryptophan) has 
potent effects in ameliorating depressive-like behaviors both in chronic stress and inflammation-induced sickness 
behavior models48–50.
The inhibition of IDO1 by Lactobacillus-derived ROS is likely just one of the mechanisms through which 
Lactobacilli, and L. reuteri in particular, contribute to host physiology and modulate behavior. Our findings are in 
accordance with the previously reported beneficial effect of L. reuteri administration on despair and anxiety-like 
behaviors25. Nevertheless, in their study, Bravo and colleagues have shown that L. reuteri can modulate GABA 
receptor expression in the CNS, via the vagus nerve25. The vagus nerve has been shown to carry peripheral sig-
nals and modulate inflammatory and stress reponses51–54. Whether the two results are connected remains to be 
investigated. It is possible that intestinal kynurenine can signal on the afferent vagal terminals and modulate its 
effects in the CNS, including its modulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. To this point, it is 
important to consider the contribution of liver TDO to peripheral kynurenine levels. TDO expression and activity 
are increased by glucocorticoids and in response to acute stress, and play a role in glucocorticoid levels homeosta-
sis55–57. Whether TDO levels decrease chronically in our long-term stress model (following an expected decrease 
of corticosterone) or what effect the Lactobacillus administration has remains to be investigated. We have also 
considered other possible mechanisms for the behavioral effects of L. reuteri supplementation, mediated by the 
immune system, or other populations of commensals affected by the treatment. Further studies will be necessary 
to assess the chronological and the hierarchical role of each pathway during despair behavior development, as 
well as how these pathways affect the CNS.
Altogether, our results indicate that the microbiome can play a causative role in the development and 
symptomatology of depression. Further studies are needed to prove a causal relationship between intestinal 
Lactobacillus levels and depressive-like behavior. Moreover, investigation of whether Lactobacilli can play a simi-
lar function in human biology and if manipulation of Lactobacillus levels and/or local induction of ROS produc-
tion in the gut could be used to treat psychiatric disorders is warranted.
Methods and Materials
Animals. 
All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations of the 
University of Virginia and approved by the University of Virginia Animal Care and Use Committee. Male 
C57BL/6 and BALB/c (8 weeks old) were purchased from Jackson or Taconic laboratories as described in the text. 
The mice were maintained on a 12 hours light/dark cycle with lights on at 7am. Chronic stress was started after 
at least 1 week of acclimation. All behavioral interventions were performed between 4 pm and 7 pm and take-
downs were performed between 11am and 2 pm. Sample size was selected to be similar to previously reported 
behavioral experiments. Animals were housed 2–3 per cage and cages were randomly assigned to control or 
experimental groups. In each experiment, every group consisted of at least 3 cages in order to minimize cage 
effects. Investigators were not blinded to the group allocation. Experiments were conducted in such a way as to 
make sure that all experimental groups were exposed to the same environments. Animals were excluded from 
the experiments if they developed illnesses (e.g. dermatitis) that might affect the outcome of the results. Certain 
measurements are occasionally not available for each mouse enrolled in the study due to technical issues (e.g. 
fecal sample not provided, sample loss).

Chronic mild stress protocol. 
Mice were subjected daily to an acute stressor (1–2 hours: restraint, loud 
white noise, crowded housing, strobe light) and an overnight stressor (12–24 hours: 45° cage tilting, repeated 
cage changes, wet bedding, dark deprivation) presented in a randomized fashion as described in the literature13. 
For restraint stress, mice were placed in clean 50 mL conical tubes with pierced holes for ventilation for 1 hour. 
For crowded housing stress, mice were placed on top of the cage wire for 2 hours, after which their cage was 
changed. For wet bedding stress, 200 mL of water was added to the bedding of a clean cage. All procedures used 
autoclaved, sterile materials (bedding, water) in order to prevent contamination. Food, water intake, and weights 
were monitored in initial experiments and no major changes were observed in the stressed group. For subsequent 
experiments, monitored parameters are indicated on matching experimental design figures. Sequencing results 
showed no new OTUs in the stressed microbiota, indicating the lack of contamination during the stress protocol.
Behavioral assessment. 
Despair behavior was assessed at time points of interest using the forced swim 
test, as described in the literature58. The last 4 minutes (out of 6 minutes total test) were scored for escape behav-
ior, defined as active swimming, with all four limbs and tail moving. The test was conducted using autoclaved 
water and disinfected containers. Anxiety/compulsive behavior was assessed using the nestlet-shredding test16. 
The mice were singled housed 30–60 minutes before the beginning of the test. Each mouse then received a 
pre-weighed nestlet and allowed undisturbed activity for either 30 or 60 minutes. At the end of the test, the piece 
of nestlet that was still intact was weighed.
DNA isolation. 
Whole genomic DNA was isolated via phenol-chloroform extraction. Briefly, a fecal pel-
let was placed in a 2 mL tube containing 200 μ 
L silica-zirconia beads (0.1 mm). The tube was filled with 750 μ 
L 
extraction buffer, 200 μ 
L 20% SDS and 750 μ 
L phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). After disruption, the 
aqueous phase was separated by centrifugation and cleaned up with two washes of chloroform-isoamyl alcohol 
(24:1). The DNA was precipitated and resuspended in 10 mM Tris solution.
Fecal microbiota sequencing. 
For 16S rRNA sequencing, the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was 
amplified for 25 cycles using specific primers with adapter overhangs as per the Illumina library preparation 
guide (Sup. Table 1). Following purification of the PCR products, individual indexes were added to the amplicons 
by PCR. The amplicons were purified, pooled in equal quantities, and then sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq 
platform. Reads with an average quality score below 25 (from any 10-bp window) or a mismatched barcode were 
removed. Paired-end reads were then merged using the software FLASH59. Merged reads were analyzed using the 
QIIME pipeline with default parameters to remove chimeric, pick 97%-identity OTUs and assign taxonomy60.
Selective culture of Lactobacilli and L. reuteri preparation. 
Fecal pellets were resuspended in 1 mL of 
deMan, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) broth supplemented with sodium azide (0.02% w/v) to select Lactobacillus19. 
After brief decanting of insoluble fecal material, samples were further diluted 1:1000 in MRS/azide and 50 μ 
L 
of this dilution were spread on MRS/azide agar plates and grown overnight at 37 °C, in aerobic conditions. The 
plates were then imaged with a Bio-Rad gel imager and colonies were counted using the “particle counter” plugin 
in ImageJ.
For Lactobacillus supplementation experiments, L. reuteri was obtained from ATCC (23272) and cultured aer-
obically according to manufacturer instructions. Radiated food pellets were pulverized in a blender and kneaded 
with fresh L. reuteri (2 billion CFU/mouse/day) and water, or with MRS culture broth and water for control. The 
animals received fresh food prepared daily.
Intestinal transit time measurement. 
Large intestinal transit time was measured as previously 
described61. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isofluorane and a 3 mm diameter glass bead was inserted 2 cm 
inside the rectum with a lubricated rod. The mice were then placed in an empty cage without bedding and the 
time to bead expulsion was measured.
Intestinal tissue analysis. 
The small intestine was dissected by excising under the stomach and before the 
cecum. Mesenteric fat and Peyer’s patches were carefully removed using fine forceps. The intestine was opened 
longitudinally and the contents were removed in two PBS washes. Excess liquid was gently absorbed using 
kimwipes and the tissue was weighed. Intestinal cells were then isolated as previously described62. Briefly, the 
mucus layer and epithelial cells were shook off in two washes with HBSS/5% FBS/2 mM EDTA. The tissue was 
then digested with collagenase VIII (Sigma, C2139) for 12–15 minutes, filtered, and the cells washed twice with 
HBSS/5% FBS/2 mM EDTA and finally resuspended in FACS buffer (0.01 M PBS, 1% BSA, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% 
sodium azide). Cell counts and viability were determined using an acridine orange/propidium iodine assay on a 
Nexcelom cell counter.
Metabolite analysis. 
Blood was collected by cardiac puncture and centrifuged at 10,000 × 
 g for 3 minutes 
in gel tubes for serum preparation. Frozen (− 
80 °C) serum samples were shipped to the University of Michigan 
Metabolomics Core for untargeted metabolomics analysis. Metabolites isolated by positive and negative ion 
selection were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry peak intensities were further analyzed using 
the MetaboAnalyst online software. Peak values were filtered using the interquantile range, normalized to the 
group sum, then log transformed and auto-scaled for principal component analysis and further statistical tests63. 
Identifiable significant metabolites were analyzed through pathway analysis, followed by further manual pathway 
enrichment.
ROS quantification. 
Fresh fecal samples were collected in sterile 2 mL tubes, weighed, and resuspended 
in 1 mL sterile PBS. After brief sedimentation of insoluble particles, 500 μ 
L of bacterial slurry were incubated

at 37 °C for 30 minutes. Following bacterial culture centrifugation, 50 μ 
L of supernatant was reacted using the 
Amplex Red hydrogen peroxide/peroxidase assay kit (Thermo Fisher, cat. A22188) according to manufacturer’s 
protocol. For ROS production by individual Lactobacillus species, fecal Lactobacilli were cultured as described 
above for 20 hours. Individual colonies were selected and dissociated in 200 uL MRS media and incubated for 
30 minutes at 37 °C. The resulting ROS concentration was measured as described above. The identity of each 
colony was verified using specific primers (Sup. Table 1).
qPCR. 
For RNA quantification, frozen tissues (brain and intestine) were homogenized by bead beating in 
RNA TRI Reagent (Life technologies) and RNA was extracted according to manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA was 
synthethized with the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Life Technologies). cDNA was amplified 
using the Sensifast Sybr NO-ROX kit (Bioline), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Gapdh was measured as 
a normalizer for each sample. Results were analyzed by the relative quantity (Δ 
Δ 
Ct) method64.
For total 16S rRNA quantification, we followed the BactQuant protocol described by Liu et al.65. Briefly, the 
16S gene was amplified using primers directed to the V3-V4 rRNA region (Sup. Table 1). L. reuteri DNA was used 
for the standard curve. For relative quantification of total Lactobacillus or specific Lactobacillus species, the Δ 
Δ 
Ct method was used to compare Lactobacillus-specific amplification to that of the 16S rRNA gene. Reactions were 
performed using the Sensifast Sybr NoROX kit from Bioline (BIO-98005). Primer sequences are available in Sup. 
Table 1.
Statistical analysis. 
All statistical analyses were performed in Prism. The results of the statistical tests are 
presented within the results section. Analyses involving two groups were performed using a two-tailed t-test. 
If the variances between groups were significantly different, a Welch’s correction was applied. For experiments 
involving stress and another variable (e.g. L.reuteri treatment), data were analyzed with a two-way ANOVA. For 
the metabolomics experiments involving only 3 groups, a one-way ANOVA was utilized. Outliers were excluded 
if they fell more than two standard deviations from the mean. For all analyses, the threshold for significance was 
at p < 
 0.05. Repeats for each experiment, if performed, are specified in the figure legend corresponding to the 
respective panel.
