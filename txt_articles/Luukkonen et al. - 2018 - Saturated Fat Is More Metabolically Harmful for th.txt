 Saturated Fat Is More
Metabolically Harmful for the
Human Liver Than Unsaturated
Fat or Simple Sugars
Diabetes Care 2018;41:1732–1739 | https://doi.org/10.2337/dc18-0071
OBJECTIVE
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (i.e., increased intrahepatic triglyceride [IHTG]
content), predisposes to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Adipose tissue
lipolysis and hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) are the main pathways contributing
to IHTG. We hypothesized that dietary macronutrient composition influences the
pathways, mediators, and magnitude of weight gain-induced changes in IHTG.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
We overfed 38 overweight subjects (age 48 6 2 years, BMI 31 6 1 kg/m2, liver fat
4.7 6 0.9%) 1,000 extra kcal/day of saturated (SAT) or unsaturated (UNSAT) fat or
simple sugars (CARB) for 3 weeks. We measured IHTG (1H-MRS), pathways con-
tributing to IHTG (lipolysis ([2H5]glycerol) and DNL (2H2O) basally and during eugly-
cemic hyperinsulinemia), insulin resistance, endotoxemia, plasma ceramides, and
adipose tissue gene expression at 0 and 3 weeks.
RESULTS
Overfeeding SAT increased IHTG more (+55%) than UNSAT (+15%, P < 0.05). CARB
increased IHTG (+33%) by stimulating DNL (+98%). SAT significantly increased while
UNSAT decreased lipolysis. SAT induced insulin resistance and endotoxemia and
significantly increased multiple plasma ceramides. The diets had distinct effects on
adipose tissue gene expression.
CONCLUSIONS
Macronutrient composition of excess energy influences pathways of IHTG: CARB
increases DNL, while SAT increases and UNSAT decreases lipolysis. SAT induced the
greatest increase in IHTG, insulin resistance, and harmful ceramides. Decreased
intakes of SAT could be beneficial in reducing IHTG and the associated risk of
diabetes.
The rapid increase in the prevalence of obesity has led to a coepidemic of nonalcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (1). NAFLD is strongly associated with insulin resistance (IR)
and predicts the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (1).
Although obesity is its primary acquired cause, some subjects who gain weight do not
develop NAFLD (1,2). Whether composition of the diet contributes to susceptibility of
NAFLD is unclear. Saturated but not polyunsaturated fat has been reported to increase
intrahepatic triglycerides (IHTGs) in young nonobese adults, despite similar weight gain
(2). The epidemic of obesity has been attributed to an increased intake of simple sugars

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY/COMPLICATIONS
 (3). However, no studies have compared
the effects on IHTGs of overfeeding diets
enriched in simple sugars or saturated
or unsaturated fat.
Fatty acids (FAs) in IHTGs can originate
from adipose tissue lipolysis, hepatic de
novo lipogenesis (DNL), and dietary fat (4).
Lipolysis provides most of the FAs used
for synthesis of IHTGs (4). DNL produces
exclusively saturated FAs (SFAs) from
substrates such as simple sugars (4,5).
Excess sugar intakes increase DNL and
IHTG content in humans (5). In mice, a
high-fat diet increases adipose tissue
lipolysis (6). The pathway by which IHTGs
are synthesized in response to overcon-
suming fat has not been studied in
humans.
Although IHTGs are commonly asso-
ciated with IR, triglycerides (TGs) them-
selves are inert and do not confer IR (7).
Wehavepreviouslyshowninhumansthat
IR cosegregates with hepatic ceramides,
independent of IHTGs and obesity (7).
Ceramides are synthesized de novo from
SFAs, such as palmitate, and interfere with
glucose metabolism by inhibiting insulin
signaling (8) and by stimulating hepatic
gluconeogenesis (9). Inflammatory medi-
ators, such as endotoxins derived from gut
bacteria, may induce IR by upregulating
ceramide synthesis (10). In mice, satu-
rated but not unsaturated fat feeding
increases the proportion of endotoxin-
containing bacteria in the gut, increases
plasma concentrations of endotoxin, and
induces IR (11,12). To our knowledge, there
are no human data comparing the effects
of hypercaloric diets enriched with satu-
rated or unsaturated fat or simple sugars
on IR, plasma ceramides, endotoxemia,
and gut microbiota.
In the current study, we hypothesized
that the metabolic effects of a hyper-
caloric diet depend on the macronutrient
composition. Specifically, we hypothe-
sized that 1) overconsumption of simple
sugars stimulates DNL whereas saturated
fat increases lipolysis, 2) overconsump-
tion of simple sugars and saturated fat
increases availability of SFAs and thereby
ceramide synthesis, and 3) saturated but
not unsaturated fat or simple sugar diets
induce endotoxemia, which may further
increase ceramide synthesis. Accordingly,
we compared the effects of three hyper-
caloric (1,000 extra kcal/day for 3 weeks)
diets on 1) IHTG content, 2) rates of DNL, 3)
rates of lipolysis, 4) adipose tissue tran-
scriptome, 5) plasma concentrations of
ceramides, and 6) gut microbiota and a cir-
culating marker of endotoxemia (Fig. 1A).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Subjects
Subjects in this study (clinicaltrials.gov,
NCT02133144) were recruited by news-
paper advertisements or by contacting
subjects who previously had participated
in metabolic studies. Exclusion criteria
included 1) type 1 or 2 diabetes, 2) pre-
existing autoimmune, viral, or drug-induced
liver disease, 3) excessive use of alcohol
(.20 g/day for women and .30 g/day
for men), 4) evidence of any other acute
or chronic disease, 5) extreme obesity
(BMI $40 kg/m2), 6) use of drugs influ-
encing glucose orlipid metabolism, and 7)
pregnancy or lactation. All subjects suit-
able for the study based on a telephone
interview were invited for a screening
visit. The flowchart of study subjects is
shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. The na-
ture and potential risks of the study were
explained to volunteers before obtaining
written informed consent. The Helsinki
University Hospital Ethics Committee ap-
proved the study protocol.
Study Design
The day before the metabolic study, a
blood sample was taken for measure-
ment of background enrichment of 2H in
plasma water and VLDL-TG palmitate for
measurement of DNL (Fig. 1A). Subjects
then underwent measurement of IHTGs
by proton MRS (1H-MRS). The following
morning, subjects arrived at the clini-
cal research unit after an overnight fast
and after consuming deuterated water
(2H2O) (3 g/kg body water) the evening
before the study day to achieve a plasma
water enrichment of 0.3% for the mea-
surement of DNL. Fecal samples were
self-collected and stored immediately
at 220°C and within 24 h at 280°C until
analysis.
Body
composition
(InBody
720; BioSpace, Seoul, Korea), weight,
and height were measured, and blood sam-
ples were taken for measurement of DNL
and for liver function tests, fasting glucose,
free FAs (FFAs), insulin, TGs, and total,
HDL, and LDL cholesterol. Thereafter, a
euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp com-
bined with infusion of [2H5]glycerol for
measurement of lipolysis was performed.
After the baseline visit, the subjects
were randomized to one of three groups
to consume a hypercaloric (1,000 excess
kcal/day) diet for 3 weeks, with excess
energy originating predominantly from
saturated fat (SAT, 76% from SFAs, 21%
from monounsaturated FAs [MUFAs],
and 3% from polyunsaturated FAs
[PUFAs]), unsaturated fat (UNSAT, 57%
from MUFAs, 22% from PUFAs, 21%
from SFAs), or simple sugars (CARB,
100% simple sugars). The overfeeding
diets were provided to participants and
consisted in the SAT group of 30 g co-
conut oil, 40 g butter, and 100 g 40% fat
containing blue cheese as extra energy
per day; in the UNSAT group of 36 g olive
oil, 26 g pesto, 54 g pecan nuts, and 20 g
butter; and in the CARB group of 2.8 dL
orange juice, 4.3 dL sugar-sweetened bev-
erage, and 200 g candy. Of the overfeeding
energy, 2%, 91%, and 7% came from
carbohydrate,fat,andproteinintheUNSAT
group and 1%, 86%, and 13% from these
sources in the SAT group, respectively, and
100% from simple sugars in the CARB
group. After 3 weeks of consuming the
hypercaloric diets, baseline measurements
were repeated.
Adherence to the diets was reinforced
by weekly contacts with the study dietitian
and verified by 3-day dietary records,
which were performed before and after
3 weeks on the diet, and by measuring
the FA composition of fasting VLDL-TG
as an objective biomarker of recent
dietary FA intake (13). The food records
were analyzed using the AivoDiet soft-
ware (version 2.0.2.3; Aivo Finland, Turku,
Finland).
Methods
The FA composition of VLDL-TG was
assessed as described in the Supplemen-
tary Data. Respiratory gas exchange
and rates of resting energy expenditure
and substrate oxidation were recorded
by indirect calorimetry as previously de-
scribed (14). IHTG content was determined
by 1H-MRS and visceral and subcutaneous
fat by MRI using 1.5-T Siemens Avantofit
as described (5). Fasting DNL was assessed
based on the incorporation of deuterium
from 2H2O in plasma water (Finnigan Gas-
Bench-II; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Lough-
borough, U.K.) into VLDL-TG palmitate
using gas chromatography–mass spec-
trometry. Further details of DNL method-
ologyaregivenintheSupplementaryData.
Insulin action on serum FFAs and glycerol
Ra were determined using the euglycemic-
hyperinsulinemic clamp technique as pre-
viously described (5). The insulin infusion
lasted 120 min (120–240), and the rate

 of the continuous insulin infusion was 0.4
mU/kgz min.Adipose tissue transcriptome
and gut microbiota were analyzed as de-
tailed in the Supplementary Data. Plasma
ceramide analyses were performed as
previously described (15). Serum lipopoly-
saccharide-binding protein (LBP) and sol-
uble cluster of differentiation 14 (sCD14)
were measured by quantitative ELISA using
human LBP DuoSet and human CD14
DuoSet kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN). Plasma adiponectin (7) and other
analytical procedures were assessed as
previously described (15).
Power Calculation
IHTG was the primary outcome. We cal-
culated from a previous study (2) that
12 subjects per group were needed to
detect a 1.4% difference in change in liver
fat between the three groups with an a
of 0.05, b of 0.2, and SD of 1.0.
Statistics
Continuous variables were tested for
normalityusingtheKolmogorov-Smirnov
method. Changes between groups were
compared using one-way ANOVA, fol-
lowed by a Fisher least significant differ-
ences test to analyze the differences
between groups. Nonparametric varia-
bles were log-transformed for analysis
and back-transformed for presentation
or were analyzed nonparametrically with
the Kruskal-Wallis test. The paired Stu-
dent t test was used to explore within-
group effects of overfeeding. Categorical
variables were analyzed with the Fisher
exact test. Data are presented as the
means with SDs for normally distributed
variables and as medians (quartiles 1–3)
for nonnormally distributed variables,
unless otherwise specified. P , 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
Baseline studies were performed in 39
subjects, of which 38 completed the
study. The SAT, UNSAT, and CARB groups
were comparable with respect to age,
sex, BMI, IHTG, body composition, and bio-
chemical characteristics such as glucose,

determined by 1H-MRS, hepatic DNL from 2H2O enrichment in VLDL-TG palmitate, adipose tissue lipolysis by [2H5]glycerol in the basal state and during
euglycemic hyperinsulinemia, plasma ceramides by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, and endotoxemia by fecal

 insulin, lipids, and liver enzymes (Table 1).
Baseline composition of the diet (Supple-
mentary Table 1) and the FA composition
of VLDL-TG (Supplementary Table 2) were
also comparable between the groups.
Compliance
Macronutrient Composition
At the end of the overfeeding period, fat
comprised 60% (54–64) and 59% (53–61)
of the total energy intake in the SAT and
UNSATgroups,respectively.Thesepercen-
tages were twofold higher than in the
CARB group (24% [20–26]) (Supplemen-
tary Table 1). Saturated fat intake was
twofold higher in the SAT group (33%
[28–36]) than in the UNSAT group (14%
[14–18], P , 0.001). Monounsaturated
(28% [23–30] UNSAT vs. 13% [12–15]
SAT, P , 0.001) and polyunsaturated
(11% [10–14] UNSAT vs. 5% [4–5] SAT,
P , 0.001) fat intakes were twofold higher
in the UNSAT than in the SAT group. The
percentage of total energy intake from
carbohydrate was 2.8-fold higher in the
CARB group (64% [58–68]) than in the
UNSAT (23% [19–29], P , 0.001) or the SAT
(26% [23–32], P , 0.001) groups.
FA Composition of VLDL-TG
The FA composition of fasting plasma
VLDL-TG was used to monitor compli-
ance (Fig. 1B). During the SAT diet, the
abundance of SFA in VLDL-TG increased
significantly: 16:0 by 17% (26.2 6 3.6 vs.
30.7 6 3.6 mol% [P , 0.001], 18:0 (3.1 6
1.2 vs. 4.1 6 1.2 mol% [P , 0.01]), and
14:0 (1.8 6 0.7 vs. 4.8 6 1.7 mol% [P ,
0.001]). The abundance of 18:2 de-
creased significantly during the SAT diet.
During the UNSAT diet, 18:2 increased
significantly (P , 0.01). During the CARB
diet, the abundance of 16:0, 14:0, and
16:1 increased and 18:2 decreased sig-
nificantly (P , 0.05) (Fig. 1B).
Body Weight and Composition
Body weight in all subjects increased
by 1.4 6 1.5% from 92.1 6 17.0 to
93.3 6 17.2 kg (P , 0.001). Changes in
body weight averaged 1.4 6 1.2 kg in the
SAT, 0.9 6 1.1 kg in the UNSAT, and 1.4 6
1.6 kg in the CARB groups (P = NS). Visceral
(1,940 6 1,605 vs. 2,072 6 1,674 cm3;
2,019 6 1,328 vs. 2,080 6 1,361 cm3;
2,014 6 1,217 vs. 2,115 6 1,351 cm3,
before vs. after, respectively, in the
SAT, UNSAT, and CARB groups) and sub-
cutaneous (4,770 6 2,152 vs. 4,906 6
2,090 cm3; 4,732 6 2,350 vs. 4,805 6
2,473 cm3; 5,133 6 2,154 vs. 5,204 6
2,157 cm3, respectively) fat volumes
tended to increase but did not change
significantly during overfeeding.
Energy Expenditure and Substrate
Oxidation Rates
As expected, overfeeding increased rest-
ing energy expenditure significantly from
7.49 6 1.36 to 7.61 6 1.48 MJ/day (P ,
0.05) in all subjects. Rates of energy
expenditure and substrate oxidation rates
expressed per kilogram body weight or fat-
free mass remained unchanged in all sub-
jects, within and between groups (data
not shown). Nonprotein respiratory
quotient did not change with overfeeding
(data not shown).
IHTGs
IHTGs increased by 55% (4.9 6 6.6 vs.
7.6 6 8.8%, P , 0.001) in the SAT group,
by 15% (4.8 6 4.9 vs. 5.5 6 4.8%, P ,
0.02) in the UNSAT group, and by 33%
(4.3 6 4.7 vs. 5.7 6 5.4%, P , 0.02) in the
CARB group (Fig. 1C). The increase was
significantly greater in the SAT than the
UNSAT group (P , 0.01) (Fig. 1D). This
difference was independent of changes
in body weight as determined by the
significantly different intercepts of the
linearregressionlinesbetweenchangein
IHTGs and change in body weight in the
SAT versus the UNSAT group (P , 0.05)
(Supplementary Fig. 2).
Hepatic DNL
Hepatic DNL, as determined by the
amount of newly synthesized palmitate
in VLDL-TG, increased significantly dur-
ing the CARB diet (96 [47–116] vs. 190

Lipolysis
Basal State
Fasting serum insulin increased signifi-
cantly with overfeeding in the SAT group
(8.1 [5.8–11.9] vs. 9.5 [5.9–11.9] mU/L,
P , 0.05) but remained unchanged in
theUNSAT(9.1[6.5–14.6]vs.9.5[7.8–11.1]
mU/L, P = NS) and CARB (10.3 [6.2–19.2]
vs. 11.1 [6.9–23.8] mU/L, P = NS) groups.
Basal whole-body glycerol Ra remained
unchanged in all groups (Fig. 2B).
Euglycemic Hyperinsulinemia
During hyperinsulinemia, increases in
serum insulin concentrations were sim-
ilar before and after the diets (22 6 7 vs.
22 6 6 mU/L, P = NS), with no differences
between the SAT, UNSAT, and CARB
groups (data not shown). Whole-body
glycerol Ra during euglycemic hyperinsu-
linemia compared with baseline increased
in the SAT (2.08 6 0.46 vs. 2.31 6
0.59 mmol/kg z min, P , 0.05), decreased
in the UNSAT (2.59 6 0.87 vs. 2.14 6
0.77 mmol/kg z min, P , 0.05), and
remained unchanged in the CARB (2.15
6 0.74 vs. 2.27 6 0.64 mmol/kg z min, P =
NS) group after overfeeding (Fig. 2C).
Whole-body glycerolRaduringeuglycemic
hyperinsulinemia increased significantly
moreintheSATcomparedwiththeUNSAT
(P , 0.001) and in the CARB compared
with theUNSAT(P , 0.01) group (Fig. 2C).
Serum FFAs
Serum free fatty acid concentrations, which
reflect the net effects of lipolysis and lipo-
genesis, remained unchanged in the SAT
group but decreased significantly during
hyperinsulinemia by overfeeding in the UN-
SATandCARBgroups(SupplementaryFig.3).
Adipose Tissue Transcriptome
Gene set analysis identified 28 reporter
pathways of 134 curated Kyoto Encyclo-
pedia of Genes and Genomes pathways
at a 5% false discovery rate. The SAT and
CARB diets changed 18 pathways, and
the UNSAT diet changed 5 pathways,
which were highly distinctive between
the diets. Only three pathways over-
lapped between all diets (Fig. 2D). The
pathways upregulated by the SAT diet
included those related to inflammation,
such as genes related to Escherichia coli
infection, natural killer cell–mediated cy-
totoxicity, nucleotide-binding oligomeri-
zation domain-like receptor signaling,
and leukocyte transendothelial migration,
and to glycerolipid metabolism. The SAT
and CARB diets shared some pathways
related to inflammation, such as genes
relatedtoantigenprocessing,chemokine
signaling, and hematopoietic cell lineage.
In addition, the CARB diet induced pathways
related to carbohydrate metabolism, such
asfructoseandmannosemetabolism,pen-
tose phosphate pathway, and glycolysis/
gluconeogenesis. The UNSAT diet upregu-
lated pathways related to oxidative phos-
phorylation and extracellular matrix.
IR and Plasma Ceramides
In the SAT group, HOMA-IR increased
significantly by 23% (1.9 [1.3–3.2] vs. 2.2
[1.4–3.3], P , 0.05). Total plasma ceram-
ide concentration also increased signif-
icantly by 49% (P , 0.001) in the SAT
group. In contrast, there were no changes
in plasma ceramides in the UNSAT or CARB
groups. The increase in total plasma ce-
ramides was significantly higher in the SAT
compared with the UNSAT (P , 0.05) and
the CARB (P , 0.001) groups. This dif-
ference was independent of changes in
body weight as determined by the signif-
icantly different intercepts of the linear
regression lines between change in total
plasma ceramides and change in body
weight in the SAT versus the UNSAT (P ,
0.05) and in the SAT versus the CARB (P ,
0.001) groups.
The increase in total plasma ceramide
concentration in the SAT group was due to
increases in several long-chain ceramides
(Fig.3andSupplementaryTable3).Plasma
concentrations of dihydroceramides (i.e.,
theprecursors of ceramidesin the de novo
ceramide synthetic pathway, the species
with 18:0 sphingoid base) were also in-
creased in the SAT but not in the other
groups (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 3).

Diets Affect Liver Fat Content
Diabetes Care Volume 41, August 2018
 Gut Microbiota and LBP-to-sCD14 Ratio
Serum LBP-to-sCD14 ratio, a marker of
endotoxemia(16),increasedsignificantly
(4.3 6 1.0 vs. 4.7 6 1.1 [P , 0.01]) in the
SAT group but not in the other groups.
The increase in LBP-to-sCD14 ratio was
significantly higher in the SAT compared
with UNSAT (P , 0.05) and CARB (P ,
0.001) groups. We found 79% of the
between-sample gut microbiota varia-
tion was explained by the subject (P ,
0.001)(SupplementaryFig.4),highlighting
overall resilience of the individual-specific
microbiota during overfeeding. We next
analyzed individual taxa that were af-
fected by overfeeding (Supplementary
Fig. 5). The abundance of gram-negative
Proteobacteria increased 3.6-fold during
the SAT (P = 0.038) but not the other diets
(Supplementary Fig. 6). Other bacterial
families remained unchanged.
Plasma Lipids, Adiponectin, and Liver
Enzymes
Baseline concentrations are reported in
Table 1. Plasma HDL cholesterol increased
significantly by 17% in the SAT (+0.3 6
0.3 mmol/L, P , 0.01 for after vs. before)
but not in the UNSAT (+0.1 6 0.3 mmol/L)
or CARB (20.1 6 0.2 mmol/L) groups. The
increase in HDL cholesterol was signifi-
cantly greater in the SAT than in the CARB
group(P, 0.001).Plasma LDLcholesterol
increased by 10% in the SAT group (+0.3 6
0.4 mmol/L, P , 0.01) but remained
unchanged in the UNSAT and CARB
groups. No significant changes occurred
in plasma TGs or adiponectin in the
groups. Plasma alanine aminotransferase
increased significantly in the SAT (28 6
15 vs. 35 6 18 IU/L, P , 0.05) but not in
the UNSAT (26 6 9 vs. 27 6 5 IU/L) or
CARB (24 6 11 vs. 28 6 18 IU/L) groups.
Plasma aspartate aminotransferase in-
creased in the SAT (26 6 5 vs. 29 6
6IU/L,P,0.05)butremainedunchanged
in the UNSAT and CARB groups.
CONCLUSIONS
NAFLD has been shown to predict type 2
diabetes and cardiovascular disease in
multiple studies, even independent of
obesity (1), and also to increase the risk of
progressive liver disease (17). It is there-
fore interesting to compare effects of
different diets on liver fat content and
understand the underlying mechanisms.
We examinedwhetherprovisionof excess
calories as saturated (SAT) or unsaturated
(UNSAT) fats or simple sugars (CARB)
influences the metabolic response to
overfeeding in overweight subjects. All
overfeeding diets increased IHTGs. The
SAT diet induced a greater increase in
IHTGs than the UNSAT diet. The compo-
sition of the diet altered sources of excess
IHTGs. The SAT diet increased lipolysis,
whereas the CARB diet stimulated DNL.
The SAT but not the other diets increased
multiple plasma ceramides, which in-
crease the risk of cardiovascular disease
independent of LDL cholesterol (18).
Compliance
The FA composition of liver TG is similar
to that in VLDL (4). We monitored com-
pliance by analyzing changes in FA com-
position of VLDL-TG. The SAT diet
increased SFA, and the UNSAT diet in-
creased PUFA (Fig. 1B). The CARB diet
also increased SFAs, which are exclusive
products of DNL (5). These data demon-
strate that subjects were compliant and
are novel in showing that different diets
have distinct effects on hepatic FA com-
position as determined from that in VLDL-
TG. Weight gain averaged 1.2 kg in all
subjects overeating 1,000 kcal for 3 weeks.
This weight gain is consistent with the
gain of 1.6 kg observed by Ris´
erus and
colleagues (2) in healthy subjects over-
eating 600 kcal/day for 7 weeks but less
than the gain of 2.3 kg observed by Harris
et al. (19) during the first 3 weeks of
overfeeding 1,000 kcal/day. As in the
current study, interindividual variation
in the latter study was large and ranged
from 1 to 7 kg after 8 weeks (19). We also
observed slightly but not significantly less
weight gain in subjects fed the UNSAT diet
comparedwith theotherdiets.However,
the important key findings (i.e., the
greater increase in liver fat, lipolysis,
and ceramides by the SAT compared
with the UNSAT diet) were independent
of changes in body weight.
IHTG
Overfeeding increases IHTG (2,5,20). The
SAT diet increased IHTG significantly
more than the UNSAT diet in the face

 ofsimilarenergyexcessandindependent
of changes in body weight. This is con-
sistent with a previous study showing a
greater increase in IHTG after overfeed-
ing saturated than polyunsaturated fat
(2). Similarly, an isocaloric saturated fat-
enriched diet increases IHTG compared
with polyunsaturated fat (21). High sat-
urated fat intakes characterize subjects
with NAFLD (22,23). Thus, diet compo-
sition influences IHTG, and saturated
fat induces a greater accumulation of
IHTG than unsaturated fat.
Pathways of IHTG
Regarding the mechanisms underlying
increased IHTG during overfeeding, di-
rect quantification of sources of FAs in
IHTG using stable isotopes and liver biopsy
specimens in subjects with elevated IHTG
has shown that most IHTGs are derived
from adipose tissue lipolysis (59%) and
DNL (26%) (4). We found SAT increased
and UNSAT decreased adipose tissue li-
polysis. Lipolysis was traced using deu-
terated glycerol, which is not reesterified
in adipose tissue due to a lack of glycerol
kinase. This contrasts with serum FFA, the
concentration of which reflects net effects
of lipolysis and lipogenesis. Overfeeding
decreased serum FFA, as reported pre-
viously (20). No studies have measured
overfeeding effects on lipolysis in humans.
High saturated fat–feeding in mice stim-
ulates lipolysis via inflammatory media-
tors (6). In keeping with such data, we found
upregulation of multiple inflammation-
related pathways in the adipose tissue tran-
scriptome. PUFAs can inhibit lipolysis by
activation of G-protein–coupled receptor
120, which mediates anti-inflammatory
and insulin-sensitizing effects (24,25). The
opposite effects of the SAT and UNSAT
diets on lipolysis, the major contributor to
IHTG, could explain why the SAT diet in-
creased IHTG to a greater extent than the
UNSAT diet.
Overfeeding simple sugars stimulates
DNL, which produces exclusively SFA in
humansand occursmainlyintheliver(5).
Consistent with these data, the CARB diet
increased hepatic DNL and SFAs in VLDL-
TG (Figs. 1B and 2A). The CARB diet also
induced multiple pathways related to
carbohydrate metabolism in the adipose
tissue transcriptome (Fig. 2D).
IR and Its Mediators
The SAT diet induced IR. This is consis-
tent with several studies showing that
isocaloric substitution of saturated fat
with monounsaturated (26,27) or poly-
unsaturated fat (28) or carbohydrates (27)
ameliorates IR. A large prospective study
recently reported intake of foods rich in
SFA, such as butter and cheese, increased
the risk of type 2 diabetes (29).
SAT but not the other diets increased
multiple plasma ceramides. TGs them-
selves are inert and do not confer IR (7).
Ceramides are key mediators of satu-
rated fat-induced IR (8–10,30–33) in
mice and are the most upregulated lipid
species in inflamed adipose tissue in
human NAFLD (34). SFAs and ceramides
originating from de novo ceramide syn-
thesis cosegregate with IR in human
NAFLD (7). Saturated palmitoyl-CoA is
an obligate precursor for the de novo
pathway (8,30). The SAT diet thus may
have induced IR via stimulating the de
novo ceramide synthetic pathway in the
liver. The SAT but not the other diets
also increased markers of endotoxemia
and upregulated genes related to gram-
negative bacterial infection in adipose
tissue.Thesechangescouldhavecontrib-
uted to SAT-induced lipolysis and de novo
ceramide synthesis, because in mice, en-
dotoxin induces both adipose tissue in-
flammation (11) and ceramide-dependent
IR (10).
Limitations of our study include small
sample size although the largest of its
kind (35). Another limitation is that we
did not assess physical activity objec-
tively during the study. Including a con-
trol group being overfed their habitual
diet might also have been helpful.
In conclusion, overfeeding saturated
or unsaturated fat or simple sugars
for 3 weeks increases IHTG, but its mag-
nitude and the associated metabolic
changes depend on the diet. Saturated
fat induced the highest increase in IHTG
by stimulating adipose tissue lipolysis,
the major pathway of IHTG. Moreover,
saturated fat induced IR and increased
circulating concentrations of ceramides.
In contrast to saturated fat, overfeeding
of unsaturated fat led to a smaller in-
crease in IHTG, decreased lipolysis, and
no change in ceramides. Simple sugars
increased IHTG by stimulating DNL. Con-
sistent with current dietary recommen-
dations (36–38), the current study shows
that saturated fat is the most harmful
dietary constituent regarding IHTG accu-
mulation. Because NAFLD increases the
risk of type 2 diabetes, avoidance of foods
rich in saturated fats might also help in
prevention of diabetes.
