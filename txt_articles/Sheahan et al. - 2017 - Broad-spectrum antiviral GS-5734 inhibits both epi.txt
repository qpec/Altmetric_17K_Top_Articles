Emerging viral infections are difficult to control because heterogeneous members periodically cycle in and out of
humans and zoonotic hosts, complicating the development of specific antiviral therapies and vaccines. Coronaviruses
(CoVs) have a proclivity to spread rapidly into new host species causing severe disease. Severe acute respiratory syn-
drome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) successively emerged, causing severe
epidemic respiratory disease in immunologically naïve human populations throughout the globe. Broad-spectrum
therapies capable of inhibiting CoV infections would address an immediate unmet medical need and could be invaluable
in the treatment of emerging and endemic CoV infections. We show that a nucleotide prodrug, GS-5734, currently in
clinical development for treatment of Ebola virus disease, can inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication in multiple
in vitro systems, including primary human airway epithelial cell cultures with submicromolar IC50 values. GS-5734 was also
effective against bat CoVs, prepandemic bat CoVs, and circulating contemporary human CoV in primary human lung cells,
thus demonstrating broad-spectrum anti-CoV activity. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, prophylactic and early
therapeutic administration of GS-5734 significantly reduced lung viral load and improved clinical signs of disease as well as
respiratory function. These data provide substantive evidence that GS-5734 may prove effective against endemic MERS-
CoV in the Middle East, circulating human CoV, and, possibly most importantly, emerging CoV of the future.
INTRODUCTION
The genetically diverse coronavirus (CoV) family, currently composed
of four genogroups [1 (alpha), 2 (beta), 3 (gamma), and 4 (delta)],
infects birds and a variety of mammals. Thus far, only CoV groups
1 and 2 are known to infect humans. Although CoV replication ma-
chinery exhibits substantial proofreading activity, replication of viral
genomic RNA is inherently error-prone, driving the existence of ge-
netically related yet diverse quasi-species (1). Most CoV strains are nar-
row in their host range, but zoonotic CoVs have a proclivity to jump
into new host species (2). Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-
CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) are
recent examples of newly emerging CoV that caused severe disease in
immunologically naïve human populations. SARS-CoV emerged in
Guangdong, China in 2002 and, with the aid of commercial air travel,
spread rapidly throughout the globe, causing more than 8000 cases
with 10% mortality (2). In 2012, it was discovered that MERS-CoV
evolved to infect humans through bats by way of an intermediate camel
host, causing more than 1700 cases with almost 40% mortality and,
like SARS-CoV, air travel has fueled global spread to 27 countries (2).
MERS-CoV is endemic in the Middle East, and serologic studies in the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kenya suggest fairly frequent infections
in humans (>45,000 persons) (3, 4). The SARS-CoV epidemic ended
over a decade ago, but several SARS-like CoVs have been isolated from
bats that efficiently use the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 re-
ceptor, replicate to high titer in primary human airway cells, and are re-
sistant to existing therapeutic antibodies and vaccines (5, 6). With
increasing overlap of human and wild animal ecologies, the potential
for novel CoV emergence into humans is great (2). Broad-spectrum
CoV therapies capable of inhibiting known human CoV would address
an immediate unmet medical need and could be an invaluable treatment
in the event of novel CoV emergence in the future.
Currently, there are no approved specific antiviral therapies for
CoV in humans. Attempts made to treat both SARS-CoV and MERS-
CoV patients with approved antivirals (that is, ribavirin and lopinavir-
ritonavir) and immunomodulators (that is, corticosteroids, interferons,
etc.) have not been effective in randomized controlled trials (7). Clin-
ical development of effective CoV-specific direct-acting antivirals
(DAAs) has been elusive, although there are several conserved drug-
gable CoV enzyme targets including 3C-like protease, papain-like pro-
tease, and nonstructural protein 12 (nsp12) RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRp) (7). In 2016, Warren et al. reported the in vivo
antiviral efficacy of a small-molecule monophosphoramidate prodrug
of an adenosine analog, GS-5734, against Ebola virus in nonhuman pri-
mates (8). Because the mechanism of action of GS-5734 for Ebola virus is
the inhibition of the viral RdRp and previous work had suggested weak
activity of the nucleoside component of GS-5734 against SARS-CoV
(9), we sought to assess the antiviral potency and breadth of activity of
GS-5734 against a diverse panel of human and zoonotic CoV.
RESULTS
GS-5734 prevents SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication in
human airway epithelial cells
GS-5734 is a prodrug that requires metabolism by the host cell to the
pharmacologically active triphosphate (TP) to inhibit virus replication

 (9). To determine whether GS-5734 could inhibit replication of highly
pathogenic human CoV, we first evaluated antiviral activity and cyto-
toxicity in the continuous human lung epithelial cell line Calu-3 2B4
(2B4) (10). GS-5734 inhibited MERS-CoV replication in 2B4 cells with
an average half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of
0.025 mM (Fig. 1A and fig. S1). We did not observe any measureable cy-
totoxicity at concentrations of up to 10 mM (Fig. 1B and fig. S1), thus
demonstrating that the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) for GS-5734
is in excess of 10 mM (CC50/IC50 = therapeutic index, >400) in 2B4 cells.
With incubation of 1 mM GS-5734, the average intracellular concentra-
tion of the pharmacologically active TP of GS-5734 in 2B4 was 2.79 mM
during the 48-hour treatment (Fig. 1C). Together, these results suggest
that substantial inhibition of CoV replication will be achieved at low
micromolar concentrations of the TP in the lung.
Primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cell cultures are among
the most biologically relevant in vitro models of the lung, recapitulat-
ing the cellular complexity and physiology of the human conducting
airway (11). We assessed the antiviral activity of GS-5734 against SARS-
CoV and MERS-CoV in HAE cultures. A dose-dependent reduction in
replication approaching 1 log10 was observed at 0.1 mM and exceeded
2 log10 at 1 mM GS-5734 as compared to untreated controls (Fig. 2, A
and B), with average IC50 values of 0.069 mM (SARS-CoV) and 0.074 mM
(MERS-CoV). In parallel, we assessed the abundance of intracellular
genomic [open reading frame 1a (ORF1a)] and subgenomic viral RNA
[open reading frame nucleocapsid (ORFN)] via quantitative reverse tran-
scription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A dose-dependent re-
duction in both ORF1a and ORFN was observed for both SARS-CoV
and MERS-CoV (Fig. 2, C and D, and table S1), consistent with titer re-
duction. The number of MERS-CoV–infected HAE cells also diminished
with increasing dose of GS-5734, as observed by microscopy (Fig. 2E). To
assess cytotoxicity of GS-5734 in HAE, we first measured the transcript
levels of multiple proapoptotic and antiapoptotic factors within the
signaling cascades of two different death receptors, TNF (tumor necrosis
factor) and FAS (Fas cell surface death receptor) (fig. S2, A and B, and
table S2). Unlike the positive control drug staurosporine, which uniformly
up-regulated the transcription of all apoptosis factors measured, we did
not observe a dose-dependent effect with GS-5734 treatment at concen-
trations that inhibit CoV replication. We then measured cytotoxicity via
CellTiter-Glo assay in HAE treated with 10 or 0.1 mM GS-5734 or DMSO
for 48 hours. As expected, GS-5734 treatment was similar to that of
DMSO (CC50 in HAE > 10 mM; therapeutic index, >100; fig. S2C).
To assess cytotoxicity of GS-5734 in an additional primary human lung
cell type, we exposed normal human bronchiolar epithelial (NHBE)
cell cultures to dilutions of GS-5734 or two known cytotoxic compounds,
puromycin or staurosporine (fig. S3). In NHBE, the average CC50 for
GS-5734 was determined to be 45 mM, which is 1800-fold above the
observed IC50 value for MERS-CoV in 2B4 cells (0.025 mM) and 600-fold
above the observed IC50 value for MERS-CoV in HAE cells (0.074 mM)
(fig. S3, A and B). Together, we demonstrate antiviral efficacy in HAE
against both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV at concentrations that are at
least 100-fold lower than those with observable cytotoxicity.
GS-5734 is effective against a diverse array of human
and zoonotic CoV in HAE
CoV host specificity and entry into host cells are guided by the viral
spike glycoprotein whose extensive genetic variation is a reflection
of host species diversity and variation in virus receptor usage (Fig. 3A).
Conversely, the CoV RdRp nsp12 is highly conserved between CoVs
especially within genogroups (Fig. 3A), making it a potentially broadly
applicable drug target.
Because we observed an antiviral effect against the two members of
genogroup 2 (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), we sought to assess the
breadth of antiviral activity against a genetically diverse array of hu-
man and zoonotic bat CoV in HAE cells. Treatment of HAE cultures
with GS-5734 infected with human CoV NL63, a circulating group
1 human CoV that typically causes bronchitis (12), resulted in a pro-
nounced 3 log10 reduction in virus production at 0.1 mM and unde-
tectable virus at higher concentrations (Fig. 3B). Likewise, GS-5734
treatment inhibited replication of very diverse SARS-CoV–like group
2b (HKU3, WIV1, and SHC014) and MERS-CoV–like group 2c (HKU5)
bat CoVs. Among these, WIV1 and SHC014 pose particular concern
as “prepandemic strains,” which can infect HAE cultures without adapta-
tion and are thus poised for emergence in humans (5, 6). With 1 mM
GS-5734, infectious virus production of bat CoV was reduced by 1.5 log10
to 2 log10, and levels of viral genomes and subgenomic transcripts were
reduced by 1 log10 to 2 log10 (Fig. 3B). Together, these data suggest that

 GS-5734 can inhibit a broad range of diverse CoV including circulating
human CoV, zoonotic bat CoV, and prepandemic zoonotic CoV.
Prophylactic treatment with GS-5734 reduces
SARS-CoV disease
GS-5734 has relatively poor plasma stability in mice (that is, half-life,
<5 min) due to expression of a secreted carboxylesterase 1c (Ces1c)
absent in humans (13). Plasma stability of GS-5734 was markedly in-
creased (half-life, ~25 min; fig. S4) in mice genetically deleted for Ces1c
(Ces1c−/−). We confirmed that SARS-CoV pathogenesis as measured by
weight loss and lung viral titers was similar in wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J
and Ces1c−/− mice through the infection of age- and sex-matched mice
from both strains (fig. S4). We then assessed the pharmacokinetic (PK)
profile in Ces1c−/− mice dosed subcutaneously with 50 mg/kg once daily
(QD) or 25 mg/kg twice daily (BID). Plasma concentrations of prodrug
diminished rapidly, accompanied by transient exposure to the alanine
metabolite (Ala-Met) and more persistent exposure to the nucleoside
analog (Fig. 4A). The plasma PK profile in esterase-deficient mice
was similar to that reported previously in monkeys (8), but tissue accu-
mulation of metabolites was ~10-fold less efficient in mice, suggesting
that high doses and corresponding plasma exposures are necessary to
obtain lung TP levels similar to those predicted in human. The metab-
olite profile in the lung showed the TP to be the dominant intracellular
metabolite, establishing the less technically challenging assessment of
total lung metabolite levels as a close approximation of TP (Fig. 4B).
Although both 50 mg/kg QD and 25 mg/kg BID resulted in target max-
imal lung levels, tissue activation was not only less efficient in mouse
but also the TP had a substantially shorter half-life in the mouse lung
(~3 hours) relative to that observed in human lung cells in vitro or the
nonhuman primate lung in vivo (half-life, ~20 hours; fig. S5). Therefore,

 only the BID-dosing regimen was able to maintain lung levels between
12 and 24 hours, consistent with those anticipated in humans and suf-
ficient to maintain CoV inhibition over the dosing interval (Fig. 4C).
Mouse models of SARS-CoV disease faithfully recapitulate many
aspects of SARS-CoV pathogenesis in humans including anorexia,
high titers of virus replication in the lung, and the development of
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as well as an age-related
exacerbation of disease (14). As shown in Fig. 5A, prophylactic admin-
istration at 50 mg/kg QD or 25 mg/kg BID ameliorated SARS-CoV–
induced weight loss seen with vehicle treatment. Virus titers in the
lung were significantly reduced (P < 0.05) on both 2 and 5 days post-
infection (dpi) in GS-5734–treated mice as com-
pared to vehicle-treated animals (Fig. 5B). In
addition, levels of viral antigen staining in lung
sections of GS-5734–treated animals were signif-
icantly lower (P < 0.05) as compared to vehicle-
treated animals (Fig. 5, C and D). Treatment
with GS-5734 also reduced SARS-CoV–induced
lung pathology, including denuding bronchiol-
itis, perivascular accumulation of inflammatory
infiltrates (that is, “cuffing”), and intra-alveolar
edema associated with diffuse alveolar damage
as compared to vehicle-treated animals (Fig. 5E
and fig. S6).
Prophylactic treatment with GS-5734 pre-
vented defects in pulmonary function seen in
SARS-CoV–infected, vehicle-treated animals, as
measured by whole-body plethysmography
(WBP), an extremely sensitive means of quanti-
tating pulmonary function (15). Penh, a surrogate
measure of airway resistance or accumulation
of debris in the airway, was significantly (P <
0.05) elevated in vehicle-treated animals as com-
pared to those treated with GS-5734 (Fig. 5F).
Metrics of labored breathing, such as increased
exhalation time and extended pause in be-
tween the end of one breath and the beginning
of the next, were increased in vehicle-treated
animals as compared to those administered
with GS-5734 (Fig. 5F).
Therapeutic postexposure administration
of GS-5734 mitigates disease
Because prophylactic administration of GS-5734
reduced virus lung titers, improved lung func-
tion, and ameliorated symptoms of SARS-CoV
disease, it was of interest to determine whether
therapeutic treatment would also be effective.
First, we compared the antiviral efficacy of GS-
5734 (25 mg/kg, BID) beginning at −1 dpi (that
is, prophylactic) or +1 dpi (that is, therapeutic).
Therapeutic GS-5734 substantially reduced the
SARS-CoV–induced weight loss in infected
animals (Fig. 6, A and B) and significantly sup-
pressed virus lung titers (P = 0.0059), thus de-
monstrating that therapeutic administration of
GS-5734 can reduce disease and suppress repli-
cation during an ongoing infection (Fig. 6C).
Therapeutic treatment significantly (P = 0.003)
improved pulmonary function (that is, reduced Penh scores) as com-
pared to vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 6D). We then explored the
therapeutic potential of GS-5734 given at 2 dpi, which is after virus
replication and lung airway epithelial damage have peaked (fig. S7).
Disease severity and survival did not differ with treatment, but we
observed a significant reduction (P < 0.05) in SARS-CoV lung titers
of GS-5734–treated animals at 6 dpi. These data suggest that reduc-
tions in viral load after peak lung titers were achieved were insuffi-
cient to improve outcomes after the immunopathological phase of
disease had been initiated. Thus, in the mouse, if given before the peak
of SARS-CoV replication and peak damage to the airway epithelium,

 GS-5734 can improve pulmonary function, reduce viral loads, and di-
minish disease.
DISCUSSION
Emerging viral infections represent a critical global health concern
because specific antiviral therapies and vaccines are usually lacking.
To maximize the potential public health benefit of therapeutics against
emerging viruses, they should be efficacious against past (that is,
SARS-CoV), current (that is, MERS-CoV), and future emerging viral
threats. Knowledge of the spectrum of therapeutic efficacy is essential
for making informed clinical decisions, especially in the early stages of
an outbreak. Because zoonotic CoV emergence is driven by an amal-
gamation of human, wild animal, and viral factors, it is difficult to gauge
zoonotic CoV emergence potential based on viral genome sequences
alone (2). Here, we provide an example of a successful public-private
partnership that combines metagenomics, synthetic biology, primary
human cell culture models, drug metabolism, PKs, and in vivo models
of viral pathogenesis to demonstrate broad-spectrum activity of a drug
candidate against a virus family prone to emergence (fig. S8). Although
we demonstrated broad-spectrum efficacy against human and zoonotic
CoV from multiple CoV genogroups, we have not yet assessed antiviral
efficacy for all CoV genogroups, which is a limitation of our current
study. Nevertheless, our panel of reconstructed human and zoonotic
bat CoV was essential to determine whether GS-5734 would be effica-
cious against highly divergent emerged (SARS-CoV), emerging (MERS-
CoV), and circulating zoonotic strains with pandemic potential (that is,
WIV1 and SHC014) (5, 6, 16, 17). In the future, the rapid development
of vaccines, therapies, and diagnostics for emerging viruses will be
dependent on the reconstruction and the in vitro and in vivo adaptation
of these viruses in the laboratory.
Here, we report the broad-spectrum antiviral efficacy of a small
molecule against multiple genetically distinct CoV in vitro and
in vivo. Current vaccine and human monoclonal antibody approaches
have proven to be effective but typically have limited breadth of
protection due to antigenic diversity in the CoV spike glycoprotein
(5, 6). Conversely, RdRp-targeting therapies such as GS-
5734 are more likely to be broadly active against past,
current, and future CoV due to the inherent genetic con-
servation of the CoV replicase. As evidenced by the fail-
ure of the nucleoside prodrug balapiravir to translate
in vitro efficacy into in vivo efficacy in mice and hu-
mans, antiviral drug candidates should be thoroughly
evaluated in the most biologically relevant models of
pathogenesis to maximize clinical translatability (18). Cell
type–specific differences in the active transport and/or
metabolism of nucleoside analogs may affect the anti-
viral profile (19). Thus, we aimed to expand on previous
in vitro studies of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV antiviral
efficacy that were limited to monkey kidney cancer cell
lines (8, 9). Similar in cellular complexity and physiolo-
gy to the human conducting airway, the HAE cell cul-
ture contains mucus-secreting cells, basolateral cells, and
some of the main target cells of SARS-CoV (ciliated ep-
ithelial cells) and MERS-CoV (nonciliated epithelial
cells) in vivo (11, 20). With our HAE cell antiviral effi-
cacy data, we provide strong evidence that GS-5734 will
be taken up and metabolized in cells targeted by multi-
ple human and zoonotic CoV in the human lung.
Preclinical in vivo antiviral efficacy studies provide insight into the
PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) relationship of a drug from which effective
dosing regimens can be extrapolated for human clinical trial. To maxi-
mize the utility of preclinical PK/PD studies, the use of animal models that
accurately recapitulate human disease is essential. Multiple aspects of the
human disease are captured by the mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (SARS-
CoV MA15) model used herein, including high-titer virus replication lim-
ited to the lung, the development of ARDS, age-related exacerbation of
disease, and death. In contrast to humans infected with SARS-CoV where
viral titers peak 7 to 10 days after the onset of symptoms, virus titers in
the lungs of SARS-CoV MA15–infected C57BL/6 mice rapidly increase
4 to 5 logs and peak at 2 dpi, concurrent with maximal damage to the
conducting airway epithelium and alveoli (14). After 2 dpi, virus titers
wane, and the remainder of the disease course is driven by immunopath-
ology. Thus, the 7 to 10 days before peak replication in humans is com-
pressed into the first 48 hours of our mouse model. Similar to humans,
disease severity in SARS-CoV–infected mice is directly correlated with
lung viral load, which can be modulated through increasing dose of
input virus (14, 21). With both prophylactic (−1 dpi) and therapeutic
(+1 dpi) dosing of GS-5734, we demonstrate a reduction in replication
below a disease-causing threshold. Therapeutic treatment beginning
at 2 dpi reduced lung viral loads yet did not improve disease outcomes,
suggesting that antivirals initiated after virus replication and immunopa-
thology have reached their tipping point were not clinically beneficial.
This result is not surprising given the precedent set by the influenza
antiviral oseltamivir, where treatment efficacy diminishes with time after
the onset of symptoms (22). Like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV titers in the res-
piratory tract peak in the second week after the onset of symptoms (23).
Thus, the window in which to administer antiviral treatment after the onset
of symptoms but before achieving peak virus titers should be prolonged in
humans as compared to experimentally infected mice. Unfortunately, the
differences in SARS-CoV pathogenesis among mice and humans noted
above limit our ability to determine the time at which treatment no longer
will provide a clinical benefit in humans. Nevertheless, our studies provide
data that strongly support the testing of GS-5734 in nonhuman pri-
mates and suggest that therapeutic treatment of MERS-CoV–infected

 humans with GS-5734 will help diminish virus replication and disease
if administered early enough during the course of infection.
Currently, there are no approved antiviral treatments for SARS-
CoV or MERS-CoV that specifically target the virus. Multiple therapeutic
approaches against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are currently in de-
velopment including immunomodulation, vaccination, DAAs, and
host-targeted antivirals (7). Known antivirals, such as ribavirin and
lopinavir-ritonavir, and immunomodulators, such as interferon
and corticosteroids, have been used to treat both SARS-CoV and MERS-
CoV patients, but none were proven effective in randomized controlled
trials (7). Cell culture studies in multiple cell lines have demonstrated
antiviral effects of several U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved
drugs (ritonavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, mycophenolic acid, and ribavirin),
but contradictory results and experimental incongruities make the in-
terpretation difficult (24–29). Small molecules targeting SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV have been assessed in cancer cell lines in vitro, but their anti-
viral efficacy against other human or zoonotic CoV remains unknown
(16, 30). Very few small molecules have been assessed in CoV animal
models of viral pathogenesis, and some have even been shown to exac-
erbate disease (for example, ribavirin and mycophenolic acid) (31, 32).
Although the Ces1c−/− mice used herein foster increased drug stability,
they are not suitable for MERS-CoV efficacy studies because the murine
ortholog of the MERS-CoV receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), does
not facilitate MERS-CoV infection (33). Thus, our in vivo studies were
limited to SARS-CoV, and future studies assessing MERS-CoV efficacy
in double-transgenic humanized DPP4/Ces1c−/− mice are planned. Hu-
man safety testing for GS-5734 is ongoing, and the drug has already been
used to treat a small number of Ebola virus–infected patients under the
“compassionate use” clause (34). Overall, our work provides evidence that
GS-5734 may protect CoV-infected patients from progression to severe
disease and could prophylactically protect health care workers in areas
with existing endemic MERS-CoV and that its broad-spectrum activity
may prove valuable when a novel CoV emerges in the future.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The primary goal of this study was to determine whether the small-
molecule nucleoside analog GS-5734 exhibited broad-spectrum anti-
viral activity against the CoV family. Using multiple in vitro models
including human primary cells, we measured the antiviral effect of GS-
5734 on multiple CoV, encompassing much of the inherent family-wide
genetic diversity. Data presented for studies in human primary cultures
are representative of those from three human donors. Cytotoxicity was
assessed in the 2B4 cell line and in two human primary lung cell types.
Experiments were performed in triplicate unless otherwise stated. Drug
effects were measured relative to vehicle controls. The secondary goal of
this study was to assess antiviral efficacy in vivo within mouse models of
severe CoV disease. The in vivo efficacy studies were intended to gain the
data required to justify further testing in nonhuman primates and collect-
ively inform future human clinical trials. Mice were age- and sex-matched
and randomly assigned into groups before infection and treatment. The
prophylactic and therapeutic in vivo studies presented in the main text
were repeated at least once. Pathology and SARS-CoV antigen scoring
were performed in a blinded manner. Exclusion criteria for in vivo studies
were as follows: If a given mouse unexpectedly did not lose weight after
infection and their virus lung titers were more than 2 log10 lower the mean
of the group, this indicated that infection was inefficient and all data related
to that mouse were censored. Primary data are located in table S3.
Viruses
SARS-CoV expressing GFP (GFP replaces ORF7) and MERS-CoV ex-
pressing RFP (RFP replaces ORF3) were created from molecular com-
plementary DNA clones as described (11, 20). To create SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV expressing nLUC, the genes for GFP and RFP were replaced
with nLUC and isolated as referenced above. Recombinant human CoV
NL63 and recombinant bat CoV for strains HKU3, HKU5, WIV1, and
SHC014 were created as described (5, 6, 12, 16, 17).
GS-5734
GS-5734 was synthesized at Gilead Sciences Inc., and its chemical
identity and purity were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance,
high-resolution mass spectrometry, and high-performance liquid chro-
matography (HPLC) analysis (9). GS-5734 was solubilized in 100% DMSO
for in vitro studies and in vehicle containing 12% sulfobutylether-b-
cyclodextrin in water (with HCl/NaOH) at pH 5 for in vivo studies. GS-
5734 was made available to the University of North Carolina (UNC) at
Chapel Hill under a materials transfer agreement with Gilead Sciences.

GS-5734, n = 11). Weights of GS-5734–treated animals were statistically different (P < 0.05) from those of vehicle-treated animals at 3 and 4 dpi for prophylactic groups
and at 4 dpi for therapeutic groups by two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test. (B) Percent starting weights of mice in (A) at 4 dpi. (C) SARS-CoV lung

 In vitro efficacy and cytotoxicity in 2B4 cells
The human lung epithelial cell line 2B4 was maintained in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (Gibco), 20% fetal bovine serum (HyClone),
and 1× antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco) (10). Twenty-four hours after
plating 5 × 104 cells per well, fresh medium was added. In triplicate,
cells were infected for 1 hour with MERS-nLUC diluted in growth
medium (MOI of 0.08), after which virus was removed, cultures were
rinsed once, and fresh medium containing dilutions of GS-5734 or ve-
hicle was added. DMSO (0.05%) was constant in all conditions. At
48 hours postinfection (hpi), virus replication was measured by nLUC
assay (Promega), and cytotoxicity was measured via CellTiter-Glo
(Promega) assay and then read on a SpectraMax plate reader (Molecular
Devices). The IC50 value was defined in GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad)
as the concentration at which there was a 50% decrease in viral replica-
tion using ultraviolet-treated MERS-nLUC (100% inhibition) and ve-
hicle alone (0% inhibition) as controls. CC50 value was determined
through comparison of data with that from cell-free (100% cytotoxic)
and vehicle-only (0% cytotoxic) samples.
In vitro efficacy and toxicity in HAE cells
HAE cell cultures were obtained from the Tissue Procurement and
Cell Culture Core Laboratory in the Marsico Lung Institute/Cystic
Fibrosis Research Center at UNC. Before infection, HAE were washed
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and moved into air-liquid inter-
face medium containing various doses of GS-5734 ranging from 10 to
0.00260 mM (final DMSO, <0.05%) (11). HAE cultures were infected
at an MOI of 0.5 for 3 hours at 37°C, after which virus was removed,
and cultures were washed with PBS and then incubated at 37°C for
48 hours. Fluorescent images of MERS-RFP were taken at 48 hpi after
nuclear staining with Hoechst 33258. Virus replication/titration was per-
formed as previously described (11). Similar data were obtained using
cells from three different patient donors. Cytotoxicity was measured
via CellTiter-Glo (Promega) in duplicate HAE cell cultures treated with
10 or 0.1 mM GS-5734 or DMSO at 0.05%.
In vivo pharmacokinetic analysis in plasma after GS-5734
administration in Ces1c−/− mice and marmosets
Mice were subcutaneously administered with GS-5734 (25 mg/kg), af-
ter which plasma was isolated from triplicate mice at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4,
6, 8, and 12 hours after administration. Three male marmosets were
administered a single dose of GS-5734 intravenously at 10 mg/kg, after
which plasma was isolated at 0.083, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours
after administration. For both mouse and marmoset, 25 ml of plasma
was treated and analyzed as described in the Supplementary Materials
and Methods “Stability of GS-5734 in WT or Ces1c−/− mouse plasma.”
Plasma concentrations of GS-5734, alanine metabolite (Ala-Met), and
nucleoside monophosphate were determined using 8- to 10-point cal-
ibration curves spanning at least three orders of magnitude with quality
control samples to ensure accuracy and precision and prepared in normal
mouse plasma. Analytes were separated by a 75 × 2 mm (4-mm) Synergi
Hydro-RP 30A column (Phenomenex) using a multistage linear gradient
from 0.2 to 99% acetonitrile in mobile phase A at a flow rate of 260 ml/min.
Quantitation of GS-5734 metabolites in the lung after
GS-5734 administration in Ces1c−/− mice and marmosets
Mice were dosed with GS-5734 (25 or 50 mg/kg), as described above.
Lungs from triplicate mice were isolated at 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours after
administration and snap-frozen. Four male marmosets were dosed
with GS-5734, as described above, and lungs were isolated at 2 and
24 hours after administration and were snap-frozen. On dry ice,
frozen lung samples were pulverized and weighed. Dry ice–cold ex-
traction buffer containing 0.1% potassium hydroxide and 67 mM
EDTA in 70% methanol and containing 0.5 mM chloroadenosine
triphosphate as internal standard was added and homogenized. After
clarifying centrifugation at 20,000g for 20 min, supernatants were dried in
a centrifuge evaporator. Dried samples were then reconstituted with
60 ml of mobile phase A, containing 3 mM ammonium formate (pH 5)
with 10 mM dimethylhexylamine in water, and centrifuged at 20,000g
for 20 min, with final supernatants transferred to HPLC injection vials.
An aliquot of 10 ml was subsequently injected onto an API 5000 LC/
MS/MS system for analysis performed using a similar method, as de-
scribed for intracellular metabolism studies.
Prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of GS-5734 against
SARS-CoV in Ces1c−/− mice
Male and female (25- to 28-week-old) mice genetically deleted for car-
boxylesterase 1C (Ces1c−/−) (stock 014096, The Jackson Laboratory)
were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and infected with 104
PFU/50 ml (prophylactic studies) or 103 PFU/50 ml (therapeutic studies)
SARS-CoV MA15. Animals were weighed daily to monitor virus-
associated weight loss and to determine the appropriate dose volume
of GS-5734 or vehicle. GS-5734 or vehicle was administered sub-
cutaneously BID, 12 hours apart. On 2 and 5 dpi (prophylactic) or
2 and 4 or 6 dpi (therapeutic), animals were sacrificed by isoflurane
overdose, and the large left lobe was frozen at −80°C for viral titration
via plaque assay, as described (14). The inferior right lobe was placed
in 10% buffered formalin and stored at 4°C until histological analysis.
Aberrations in lung function were determined by WBP (Data Sciences
International), as described (15).
Biocontainment and biosafety
Reported studies were initiated after the UNC Institutional Biosafety
Committee approved the experimental protocols under the Baric Labora-
tory Safety Plan (20167715). SARS-CoV is a select agent. All work for
these studies was performed with approved standard operating pro-
cedures for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other related CoVs in facilities
conforming to the requirements recommended in the Biosafety in Micro-
biological and Biomedical Laboratories, the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services, the U.S. Public Health Service, the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes of Health.
Animal care
Efficacy studies were performed in animal biosafety level 3 facilities at
UNC Chapel Hill. All works were conducted under protocols approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at UNC Chapel
Hill (protocol #13-288; continued on #16-284) according to guidelines
set by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Labora-
tory Animal Care and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Statistics
All statistical calculations were performed in GraphPad Prism 7. Specific
tests to determine statistical significance are noted in each figure legend.
