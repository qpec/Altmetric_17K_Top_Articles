Obesity-related insulin resistance represents the core component of the metabolic syndrome,
promoting glucose intolerance, pancreatic beta cell failure and type 2 diabetes. Efficient and
safe insulin sensitization and glucose control remain critical therapeutic aims to prevent
diabetic late complications Here, we identify transforming growth factor beta-like stimulated
clone (TSC) 22 D4 as a molecular determinant of insulin signalling and glucose handling.
Hepatic TSC22D4 inhibition both prevents and reverses hyperglycaemia, glucose intolerance
and insulin resistance in diabetes mouse models. TSC22D4 exerts its effects on systemic
glucose homeostasis—at least in part—through the direct transcriptional regulation of the
small secretory protein lipocalin 13 (LCN13). Human diabetic patients display elevated hepatic
TSC22D4 expression, which correlates with decreased insulin sensitivity, hyperglycaemia and
LCN13 serum levels. Our results establish TSC22D4 as a checkpoint in systemic glucose
metabolism in both mice and humans, and propose TSC22D4 inhibition as an insulin
sensitizing option in diabetes therapy.

nder physiological conditions, energy homeostasis is
tightly controlled by counter-regulatory hormonal sys-
tems. Whereas pancreatic glucagon as well as adrenal
glucocorticoid hormones mediate essential parts of the fasting
response to ensure organ function during nutrient depletion1, the
pancreatic beta-cell hormone insulin triggers the fast uptake and
oxidative catabolism of glucose in liver, muscle and adipose
tissue, and simultaneously inhibits glycogenolysis and gluco-
neogenesis in liver during the postprandial state2. Insulin actions
are mediated through its membrane-bound tyrosine kinase
receptor. Upon insulin binding, the intrinsic tyrosine kinase
activity of the insulin receptor at the cell surface becomes
activated and leads to the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of
multiple signalling components, involving consecutive phos-
phorylation events at the insulin receptor substrate proteins and
the subsequent activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase
(PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) signalling axis3,4. Upon
insulin
stimulation
3-phosphoinositide-dependent
protein
kinase-1 (PDK1) phosphorylates PKB/Akt on T308 within the
kinase domain, whereas PDK2, which is represented by several
kinases including mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2
(mTORC2) phosphorylates Akt within its C terminus tail on S473
(refs 5,6). Once phosphorylated and activated Akt phosphorylates
and inhibits the inhibitor of mTORC1 the tuberous sclerosis
complex 2 (Tsc2; a.k.a Tuberin) within the Tsc1/2 to activate
downstream mTORC1 signalling to S6K1 and S6. Other targets of
Akt include glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3 beta and Forkhead
Box O 1 and 3 (FoxO1 and 3) transcription factors7. Insulin
signal transduction exerts control over biochemical pathways
through either modulation of metabolic key enzyme activities or
through the stimulation or inhibition of metabolic target gene
transcription, eventually culminating in the regulation of anabolic
glucose, lipid and protein metabolism8.
The inability of key metabolic tissues, including skeletal
muscle, adipose tissue and liver to respond to normal circulating
concentrations of insulin, that is, insulin resistance, is commonly
associated with obesity, ageing and a sedentary lifestyle8. Under
these conditions, systemic glucose and lipid homeostasis are
substantially compromised, leading to successive pancreatic beta
cell exhaustion and further deterioration of glucose homeostasis.
Upon the manifestation of glucose intolerance as a marker of the
pre-diabetic state, 5–10% of glucose-intolerant patients indeed
further progress into full-blown type 2 diabetes9.
Interestingly, insulin resistance is not only associated with
obesity-related metabolic dysfunction but also with opposing
conditions of systemic energy availability, for example, tumour-
induced body wasting (cancer cachexia) and lipodystrophy.
Indeed, both excess and lack of adipose tissue energy stores are
coupled to systemic inflammation, fatty liver development,
skeletal muscle degradation and increased adipose tissue lipolysis,
favoured by insulin resistance and the lack of anabolic insulin
action10,11.
Consequently,
safe
and
effective
modalities
to
improve systemic insulin sensitivity are direly needed not only
for counteracting obesity-related type 2 diabetes but may also
pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches in wasting
diseases.
In this respect, we have recently identified transcription factor
TSC22D4 as a regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism during
cancer cachexia12. Livers of tumour-bearing mice had elevated
levels of TSC22D4 and hepatic knockdown of TSC22D4 acutely
led to the induction of lipogenic genes. Interestingly, hepatic
TSC22D4 levels positively correlated with the degree of tumour-
induced body wasting12, overall suggesting that hepatic TSC22D4
activity may not only be involved in the control of tissue-specific
lipid
metabolism
but
also
be
linked
to
systemic
energy
homeostasis by thus far unknown mechanisms. This hypothesis
prompted us to define the hepatic TSC22D4 target gene network
and the systemic implications of hepatic TSC22D4 action at a
more global level. We now identify the hepatic TSC22D4 as a
potent regulator of insulin sensitivity in both murine and human
diabetes, acting—at least in part—through the secreted factor
lipocalin
LCN13.
TSC22D4
thus
represents
a
previously
unknown
checkpoint
in
inter-organ
communication
and
systemic metabolic control and may serve as an attractive target
in insulin sensitizing diabetes therapies.
Results
Hepatic TSC22D4 deficiency improves insulin sensitivity. To
understand the range of TSC22D4-regulated transcriptional
programmes beyond the lipogenic pathway, we performed high
throughput transcriptome profiling in primary mouse hepato-
cytes infected with adenovirus carrying either non-specific
control or TSC22D4-specific shRNA. KEGG pathway analysis
demonstrated that loss of TSC22D4 significantly regulated several
biological processes, most notably including insulin signalling
(Supplementary Fig. 1a), suggesting that TSC22D4 may exert an
important impact on hepatic and systemic insulin responses.
To test this hypothesis, we employed TSC22D4-deficient and
control
primary
mouse
hepatocytes
and
probed
for
the
phosphorylation
of
prototypical
insulin
signalling
pathway
components. Indeed, TSC22D4 depletion significantly increased
phosphorylation of Akt/PKB on both T308 and S473 as well as its
downstream targets GSK3 beta on S9 and FoxO1 on S256 under
basal and insulin-stimulated conditions, respectively (Fig. 1a),
overall indicating that TSC22D4 downregulates the insulin
signalling pathway in a hepatocyte-autonomous manner.
Furthermore, liver-specific knockdown of TSC22D4 in wild-
type animals (Supplementary Fig. 1b,c) enhanced the hepatic Akt
T308/S473 phosphorylation in response to either exogenous
insulin injection (Fig. 1b) or re-feeding in a fasting–feeding
regimen (Fig. 1c), while adenoviral liver-specific overexpression
of TSC22D4 robustly impaired S473 phosphorylation of Akt in
mouse liver and also impaired the Akt signalling to its down-
stream targets, including GSK3 beta (Fig. 1d; Supplementary
Fig. 1f), demonstrating that hepatic TSC22D4 is a critical deter-
minant of insulin signalling also in vivo.
These results prompted us to explore the functional impact
of
hepatic
TSC22D4
on
systemic
glucose
metabolism
in
healthy C57Bl/6 mice. Thus, we employed an adeno-associated
virus
(AAV)
delivery
system
allowing
the
expression
of
TSC22D4-directed miRNAs specifically in liver parenchymal cells
but not in other liver cell types for a period of several months13. Six
weeks after AAV-mediated miRNA delivery, wild-type mice with
hepatocyte-specific TSC22D4 deficiency (Supplementary Fig. 2a)
showed no change in fasting blood glucose levels (Fig. 2a) but
displayed significantly reduced levels of serum insulin (Fig. 2b) and
an improved homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance
(HOMA-IR) index as compared with control littermates (Fig. 2c).
Indeed, hepatic TSC22D4 deficiency improved insulin-triggered
systemic glucose clearance in an intra-peritoneal insulin tolerance
test (Supplementary Fig. 2b), and also improved glucose tolerance
(Fig. 2d), overall pointing towards improved systemic insulin
sensitivity
and
glucose
handling
upon
hepatocyte-specific
TSC22D4 knockdown. To validate these findings in an inde-
pendent and more acute setting, we down regulated hepatic
TSC22D4 expression by adenoviral shRNA delivery into wild-type
mice. In agreement with the long-term effects, inhibition of hepatic
TSC22D4 had no effect on serum glucose concentrations in healthy
animals under both fasting and feeding conditions (Fig. 2e;
Supplementary Fig. 2c), but again reduced fasting and feeding
serum insulin (Fig. 2f; Supplementary Fig. 2d) and HOMA-IR in

 comparison to control shRNA-injected littermates (Fig. 2g). In line
with the negative regulatory impact of TSC22D4 on hepatic insulin
signalling (Fig. 1d), liver-specific overexpression of TSC22D4
significantly elevated serum insulin levels in both low-fat diet
(LFD) (10% calories from fat) and high-fat diet (HFD) (60%
calories from fat)-fed C57Bl/6 mice as compared with control
littermates (Fig. 2h), correlating with increased HOMA-IR under
these conditions (Fig. 2i), and a trend to elevate serum glucose
levels (Fig. 2j).
Hepatic TSC22D4 knockdown prevents diabetic hyperglycaemia.
Our results thus far demonstrated that hepatic TSC22D4
inhibition (a) improves systemic insulin sensitivity and glucose
tolerance without causing episodes of hypoglycaemia under
healthy conditions (Fig. 2a) and (b) that TSC22D4 also regulates
insulin sensitivity under conditions of (high-fat diet induced)
metabolic dysfunction (Fig. 2i). Thus, we next tested the
hypothesis that hepatic TSC22D4 inhibition could serve as a
novel approach to counteract diabetic hyperglycaemia and
glucose intolerance. In this respect, we acutely downregulated
hepatic TSC22D4 expression in 14 weeks old db/db mice, a
standard model for insulin-resistant obesity and type 2 dia-
betes14. Remarkably, already 7 days after adenovirus delivery,
liver TSC22D4 deficiency improved insulin (Supplementary
Fig. 3a) and glucose tolerance as compared with control

levels in diabetic animals under refed conditions (Fig. 3b). In
line with the anti-diabetic action of TSC22D4 downregulation,
water intake (Supplementary Fig. 3b) as well as serum levels of
insulin (Fig. 3c) and c-peptide (Fig. 3d) were substantially
diminished in TSC22D4-deficient mice as compared with
controls, correlating with an induction of S473 and S9
phosphorylation of hepatic Akt and GSK3 beta, respectively,
as well as increased liver glycogen levels (Fig. 3e; Supplementary
Fig. 3c). Of note, short-term hepatic TSC22D4 inhibition
had no effect on body weight (Supplementary Fig. 3d) and
lowered serum alanine aminotransferase levels (Supplementary
Fig. 3e) indicating the absence of liver toxicity under these
conditions.

 To confirm the gluco-regulatory function of hepatic TSC22D4
in an independent model, we acutely disrupted TSC22D4
expression in livers of New Zealand obese (NZO) mice, which
represent a multigenic model of diabesity15. At 16 weeks of age,
NZO mice displayed severe obesity, insulin resistance and
hyperglycaemia as described15. Liver-specific knockdown of
TSC22D4 markedly improved insulin (Supplementary Fig. 3f)
and glucose tolerance (Fig. 3f), normalized blood glucose levels
under refed conditions (Fig. 3g), and elevated Akt and GSK3
beta phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 3j) compared with
control littermates, perfectly matching the effects in db/db mice
(Fig. 3a–e). In addition, while TSC22D4 knockdown in NZO
mice did not affect body weight, it slightly decreased abdominal
and inguinal WAT mass (Supplementary Fig. 3g–i).
The efficient and acute improvements in diabetic glucose
homeostasis next prompted us to test for a putative diabetes
prevention potential of hepatic TSC22D4 inhibition. Therefore,
we chronically knocked-down TSC22D4 specifically in hepato-
cytes of young (5 weeks old) db/db mice that still showed no signs
of obesity and metabolic dysfunction. Remarkably, while control
animals developed severe hyperglycaemia over the course of
10 weeks and displayed substantial insulin resistance, hyperinsu-
linemia and glucose intolerance at an age of 15 weeks (Fig. 3h-j),
hepatic TSC22D4 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. 3k) not only
prevented the onset of hyperglycaemia (Fig. 3k) but also
significantly improved insulin sensitivity and insulin tolerance
(Fig. 3h,i; Supplementary Fig. 3k–m) and glucose tolerance
over time (Fig. 3j). Noteworthy, at the end of the experimental
10-week period, TSC22D4 knockdown had caused a roughly 25%
reduction in HbA1c levels as compared with controls (Supple-
mentary
Fig.
3n),
thereby
outpacing
the
performance
of
metformin
in
an
almost
identical
db/db
experimental
setup16. In contrast to the induction of hypertriglyceridemia
in cancer cachectic wild-type mice upon liver-specific TSC22D4
knockdown12,
long-term
TSC22D4
deficiency
diminished
serum triglycerides (TAGs) (Supplementary Fig. 3o) but left
liver TAG levels unaltered (Supplementary Fig. 3p). Only minor
changes in body weight, fat, and lean mass were transiently
detectable over the course of the experiment (Supplementary
Fig. 3r–t). Consistent with these metabolic phenotypes, long-term
TSC22D4 knockdown impaired gluconeogenic gene expression
but left genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and lipogenesis
mostly unaffected (Fig. 3l–n).
LCN13 partially mediates the effects of hepatic TSC22D4. To
get mechanistic insights into the insulin sensitizing and glucose
lowering action of hepatic TSC22D4, we screened for the most
strongly regulated TSC22D4 target genes in the transcriptome
data
sets
from
TSC22D4-deficient
and
control
mice
(Supplementary Fig. 4a). Remarkably, the most strongly upre-
gulated gene upon TSC22D4 knockdown was represented by
lipocalin 13 (LCN13), a member of a conserved family of small
secreted
proteins17.
Liver
cistrome
analysis
by
chromatin
immunoprecipitation experiments coupled to massive parallel
sequencing (ChIP-seq) and subsequent ChIP-PCR confirmation
identified three TSC22D4-binding sites within the Lcn 13 gene
locus (Fig. 4a), proposing a direct regulatory function of
TSC22D4 in Lcn 13 expression through chromatin recruitment.
Indeed, siRNA-mediated TSC22D4 knockdown in hepatoma cells
transfected with Lcn 13 luciferase reporter constructs carrying the
identified TSC22D4-binding sites within the Lcn 13 locus induced
reporter gene activities (Supplementary Fig. 4b). In accordance,
hepatic TSC22D4 knockdown elevated Lcn 13 mRNA levels 100-,
11- and 4-fold in livers of wild-type, db/db, as well as NZO mice,
respectively (Fig. 4b). Also, Lcn 13 mRNA levels were significantly
diminished upon hepatic TSC22D4 overexpression under both
LFD and HFD conditions (Supplementary Fig. 4c), and Lcn 13
mRNA was also suppressed in livers of methionine- and cholin-
deficient (MCD) diet-fed lipodystrophic mice (Supplementary
Fig. 4d), thereby correlating with high levels of TSC22D4 in this
model as reported previously12. In line with the proposed
endocrine function of Lcn 13, western blot analysis of Akt S473
phosphorylation
in
skeletal
muscle
revealed
that
hepatic
TSC22D4 deficiency induced not only hepatic but also skeletal
muscle insulin signalling (Supplementary Fig. 4e), thereby
correlating with elevated LCN13 serum levels upon hepatic
TSC22D4 deficiency (Fig. 4c) and with direct insulin sensitization
in cultured C2C12 myotubes as well as differentiated 3T3-L1
adipocytes upon exposure to recombinant LCN13 (Fig. 4d, data
not shown). Indeed, hepatic TSC22D4 knockdown did not only
elevate
liver
but
also
skeletal
muscle
glycogen
stores
(Supplementary Fig. 4f). To address the functional role of
LCN13 as a potential mediator of hepatic TSC22D4-dependent
glucose control, we performed genetic rescue experiments in db/
db diabetic mice. Single TSC22D4 knockdown significantly
ameliorated glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and hyper-
glycaemia in db/db mice as shown above (Fig. 4e–g). Remarkably
simultaneous knockdown of hepatic LCN13 and TSC22D4
expression by double adenoviral shRNA delivery (Supple-
mentary Fig. 4g) partially re-induced systemic glucose intole-
rance (Fig. 4e) as well as dysfunctional glucose homeostasis and
insulin resistance in diabetic mice (Fig. 4f,g). Consistently,
simultaneous
knockdown
of
LCN13
and
TSC22D4
also
abrogated the improved liver and skeletal muscle insulin
signalling that we observed with single TSC22D4 knockdown,
indicated by Akt S473 phosphorylation and Glut4 expression
(Supplementary Fig. 4h,i), while levels of pro-inflammatory

together, these findings demonstrate that inhibition of LCN13
acts as one major functional downstream target of TSC22D4 in
the control of (diabetic) glucose intolerance and insulin resistance
in vivo. In addition neither TSC22D4 nor LCN13 single or double

(Supplementary
Fig.
5a,b),
overall
suggesting
that
the
TSC22D4-dependent effects on systemic insulin sensitivity and
glucose handling were mediated through both local, hepatic and
remote,
LCN13-dependent
effects
on
extra-hepatic
tissues,
including skeletal muscle and probably adipose tissue. Of note,
LCN13 re-constitution in TSC22D4 knockdown animals (Fig. 4)
only partially reversed the TSC22D4-mediated phenotype and
previous reports demonstrated that TSC22D4 localizes both in
the nucleus and in the cytoplasm in cultured neuronal cells19,
suggesting that in addition to the nuclear regulation of LCN13
gene expression, TSC22D4 may engage additional cytoplasmic
mechanisms to control cellular insulin signalling. This hypothesis
is in line with the cell-autonomous effects of TSC22D4 inhibition
on insulin signalling in isolated hepatocytes (Fig. 1) and needs to
be further explored in future studies.
Tsc22d4 levels correlate with insulin sensitivity in humans. To
finally test the relevance of our findings in humans, we analysed a
cohort of 66 patients with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) or
type 2 diabetes (T2D) (Supplementary Table 1). As shown in
Fig. 5a, TSC22D4 mRNA was significantly elevated in livers of
T2D patients as compared with NGT counterparts. Consistent
with the insulin-sensitizing and gluco-regulatory functions of
TSC22D4 in mice, hepatic Tsc22d4 mRNA levels significantly
correlated with fasting glucose levels in humans (Fig. 5b). Fur-
thermore, Tsc22d4 expression negatively correlated with insulin
sensitivity across this human cohort, the latter determined by the
glucose infusion rate (GIR) during a hyperinsulinemic-eugly-
caemic clamp (Fig. 5c). Tsc22d4 mRNA levels positively corre-
lated with circulating TAG and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels
(Supplementary Fig. 5c,d) thereby further supporting our results
from animal models (Supplementary Fig. 5e). Importantly,
LCN13 expression studies in this patient cohort revealed a highly
significant correlation between Tsc22d4 and Lcn13 mRNA levels
(Supplementary Fig. 6a), and demonstrated an overall lower
expression of LCN13 in diabetic patients as compared with non-
diabetic subjects (Supplementary Fig. 6b). In addition, hepatic
LCN13 mRNA levels correlated with GIR and fasting glucose
levels in humans (Supplementary Fig. 6c,d), overall recapitulating
the TSC22D4-LCN13-insulin sensitization link in animal models.
Discussion
Based on substantial side effects of existing pharmacological
approaches, efficient and safe insulin sensitization and glucose
control remain critical therapeutic aims to prevent diabetic late
complications20. Our data now establish TSC22D4 as a critical
node in systemic glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity.
Given
its
upstream
regulatory
function
for
the
multi-
organ enhancement of insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake,
modulation of TSC22D4 function now provides novel pers-
pectives in both the understanding of mechanisms in metabolic
inter-organ communication and the development of insulin
sensitizing treatment strategies.
According to the WHO, diabetes affects more that 347 million
individuals these days with almost 90% suffering from insulin-
resistant type 2 diabetes. For these patients, blood glucose
lowering therapies are the primary treatment option. However,
major classes of current anti-diabetic and/or insulin sensitizing
drugs are associated with severe limitations, highlighted by the
recent market withdrawal of rosiglitazone20.
Metformin, the most widely used first-line type 2 diabetes drug,
efficiently reduces HbA1c levels. However, this reduction is often
insufficient
for
many
diabetic
patients
and
its functional
dependence on the organic cation transporter (OCT) 1 may
generate a cohort of non-responders in genetic OCT1 loss-of-
function carriers. Also, despite the proven efficacy of metformin,
treatment is associated with gastro-intestinal side effects. Current
guidelines then recommend drug combinations of metformin
with sulfonylurea, thiazolidinediones, DPP-4 inhibitors or GLP-1
receptor agonists. These agents, however, are associated with
severe side effects such as bone mineral density loss and increased
fracture risk for thiazolidinediones and potentially dangerous
hypoglycaemic episodes for sulfonylureas. Due to the progressive
beta-cell dysfunction that characterizes type 2 diabetes, many
diabetic patients eventually require insulin replacement therapy
despite oral anti-diabetic treatment. It is tempting to speculate
that the improvement of metabolic inter-tissue communication
through TSC22D4 actions as demonstrated in the current
manuscript may represent a particularly effective therapeutic
approach in future diabetes and insulin sensitizing therapies,
particularly supported by the notion of an overall conservation of
the TSC22D-insulin sensitivity axis in humans.
Of note, ablation of TSC22D4 in animals did not provoke
enhanced tumour formation or hepatic dysfunction within the time
spans investigated thus far, indicating that TSC2D4-based long-
term therapeutic application may not be associated with enhanced
tumour risk as may be predicted from the potent stimulatory
impact on PI3K/Akt signalling. Indeed, while potential long-term
complications of TSC22D4 inhibition need to be addressed in
future experimental studies in detail, our data indicate that other
TSC22 family members with documented pro-tumorigenic activ-
ities21 were not able to compensate for the reduced levels of hepatic
TSC22D4, underlining the hypothesis that TSC22D4 displays a
rather unique spectrum of biological features that might spare
tumorigenic potential upon long-term inhibition.
In this regard, while acute TSC22D4 inactivation in tumour-
bearing animals led to hypertriglyceridemia12, this effect was absent
upon long-term TSC22D4 inhibition in diabetic animals, indicating

 that elevated systemic lipid levels either represent a more transient
consequence of hepatic TSC22D4 deficiency and may not compro-
mise the beneficial effects of TSC22D4 inactivation in the long run
or only occur in the wild type but not in the diabetic situation.
Overall, our data are consistent with a model in which aberrant
TSC22D4 function imposes a tonic inhibition of liver insulin
signalling and LCN13 secretion, thereby promoting a metaboli-
cally dysfunctional phenotype.
Interestingly, delivery of recombinant LCN13 into diabetic
animals has been proven to be remarkably ineffective in terms of
insulin sensitization and the restoration of glucose homeostasis18,
particularly when compared with the marked effects of hepatic
TSC22D4 knockdown as shown here, suggesting that the endo-
genous action of TSC22D4, comprising both LCN13 secretion as
well as an additional, to-be-identified intracellular mechanism
provides a particularly effective cue to control insulin sensitivity.
Given the lack of efficient and safe insulin-sensitizing therapies to
date, TSC22D4-mediated restoration of insulin action and thus
systemic energy homeostasis under relevant disease conditions,
definitely deserves further experimental exploration in the future.
Methods
Plasmids and RNA interference. For shRNA experiments, oligonucleotides
targeting mouse TSC22D4 (50-GCCTGGTTGGCATTGACAACA-30) and LCN13
(50-GCCGTGAGTTTAAATTCGTGA-30), were annealed and cloned into the
pENTR/U6 shRNA vector (Invitrogen). Non-specific oligonucleotides (50-GATC
TGATCGACACTGTAATG-30) with no significant homology to any mammalian
gene sequence were used as non-silencing controls in all experiments. Expression
vectors for Flag-tagged TSC22D4 were generated by standard PCR-based methods
and cloned into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector.). For miRNA experiments, oligo-
nucleotides targeting mouse TSC22D4 (50-GACAGCGATGACGATAGTGGT-30)
and non-specific oligonucleotides (50-AAATGTACTGCGCGTGGAGAC-30) were
cloned into pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR (‘BLOCK-iTTM PolII miR RNAi Expres-
sion Vector Kit’ (Invitrogen)). The miRNA cassette encoding a nonspecific miRNA
(50-AAATGTACTGCGCGTGGAGAC-30) was PCR-amplified from pcDNA6.2-
GW/EmGFP-miR-NC and cloned into the NotI site at the 50 end of the EGFP coding
sequence in the double stranded AAV vector pdsAAV-CMV-EGFP as described22.
Recombinant viruses. Adenoviruses expressing a TSC22D4- or LCN13- or a
non-specific shRNA under the control of the U6 promoter, or the TSC22D4
cDNA under the control of the CMV promoter were cloned using the BLOCK-iT
Adenoviral RNAi expression system (Invitrogen). Viruses were purified by the
cesium chloride method and dialysed against phosphate-buffered-saline buffer
containing 10% glycerol before animal injection, as described23. Adeno-
associated viruses encoding control or TSC22D4-specific miRNAs under the
control of a hepatocyte-specific promoter were established, as described
previously22.
Animal experiments. Male 5–12-week old C57Bl/6 and BKS.Cg-Dock7m þ / þ
Leprdb/J (000642) mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories and
maintained on a 12 h light–dark cycle with regular unrestricted diet and free
access to water. For glucose and insulin tolerance tests (GTT and ITT, respec-
tively), mice were fasted for 4 h before intraperitoneal injections. For GTTs,
fasted mice were i.p. injected with 1 mg D-glucose per g body weight. For ITTs
fasted mice were i.p. injected with 1.5 U insulin per kg body weight. Unless
otherwise stated, animals were fed ad libitum and had free access to water.
For adenovirus injections, 2 � 109 plaque-forming units (p.f.u.) per recombinant
virus were administered via tail vein injection. For double knockdown adeno-
virus injections (rescue experiment) 2 � (2 � 109) p.f.u. recombinant virus per
treatment group were used (NC group: 4 � 109 control shRNA; LCN13 group:
2 � 109 LCN13 shRNA þ 2 � 109 control shRNA; TSC22D4 group: 2 � 109
TSC22D4 shRNA þ 2 � 109 control shRNA; TSC22D4 þ LCN13 group: 2 � 109
TSC22D4 shRNA þ 2 � 109 LCN13 shRNA). For AAV experiments 5 � 1011
p.f.u. were injected via the tail vein. In high-fat diet experiments, C57Bl/6 mice
were either fed a standard chow diet (10% energy from fat, Research Diets
D12450B, USA) or a high-fat diet (60% energy from fat, Research Diets D12492,
USA) for a period of 11 weeks. In each experiment, 4-12 animals received
identical treatments and were analysed under fasted, random fed or fed condi-
tions as indicated. Organs including liver, epididymal and inguinal fat pads, and
gastrocnemius muscles were collected after specific time periods, weighed, snap-
frozen and used for further analysis.
In each animal experiment, mice were randomly assigned to each group.
Number of animals per group to detect biologically significant effect sizes was
calculated using appropriate statistical sample size formula and indicated in the
biometrical planning section of the animal licence submitted to the governing
authority. Blinding was not done during animal group allocation. Animal handling
and experimentation was performed in accordance with the European Union
directives and the German Animal Welfare Act (Tierschutzgesetz) and approved by
local authorities (Regierungspra
¨sidium, Karlsruhe, Germany).

 Quantitative Taqman RT–PCR. Total RNA was extracted from frozen organ
samples or cultured hepatocytes using QIAzol and the RNeasy (Qiagen) kit. cDNA
was prepared by reverse transcription using M-MuLV enzyme and Oligo dT
primer (Fermentas). cDNAs were amplified using assay-on-demand kits (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) and an ABI StepOnePlus sequence detector (Applied Biosystems).
RNA expression data were quantified and normalized to levels of TATA-box
binding protein RNA (Tbp) as described24.
Human TSC22D4 mRNA expression was measured by quantitative real-time
RT–PCR in a fluorescent temperature cycler using the TaqMan assay, and
fluorescence was detected on an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detector (Applied
Biosystems). Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Life Technologies), and 1 mg
RNA was reverse transcribed with standard reagents (Life Technologies). From
each RT–PCR, 2 ml were amplified in a 26 ml PCR reaction using the Brilliant SYBR
green QPCR Core reagent kit from Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Samples were incubated in the ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detector for
an initial denaturation at 95 �C for 10 min, followed by 40 PCR cycles, each cycle
consisting of 95 �C for 15 s, 60 �C for 1 min and 72 �C for 1 min. Human TSC22D4
and OBP2A (LCN13) (determined by Hs00229526_m1 and Hs01062934_g1,
respectively) (Applied Biosystems) mRNA expression was calculated relative to the
mRNA expression of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1),
determined by a premixed assay on demand for HPRT1 (Hs01003267_m1)
(Applied Biosystems). Amplification of specific transcripts was confirmed by
melting curve profiles (cooling the sample to 68�C and heating slowly to 95 �C with
measurement of fluorescence) at the end of each PCR. The specificity of the PCR
was further verified by subjecting the amplification products to agarose gel
electrophoresis.
Primary hepatocyte isolation and treatment. Primary mouse hepatocytes were
isolated and cultured as described25. Briefly, male 8–12-week old C57Bl/6 mice
were anesthetized by i.p. injection of 100 mg kg � 1 body weight ketamine
hydrochloride and 5 mg kg � 1 body weight xylazine hydrochloride. After opening
the abdominal cavity, the liver was perfused at 37 �C with HANKS I buffer via the
portal vein for 5 min and subsequently with HANKS II buffer for 5–7 min until
disintegration of the liver structure was observed. The liver capsule was removed
and the cell suspension was filtered through a 100 mm mesh. The cells were washed
and, subsequently, viability of cells was determined by trypan blue staining. 1 � 106
living cells per well were seeded on collagen I-coated 6-well plates. After 24 h, cells
were infected with recombinant adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 100.
Primary mouse hepatocytes were either treated with PBS or insulin at a
concentration of 100 nM per well for 10 min.
Gene expression profiling. Gene expression profiling was performed for liver
extracts from control or TSC22D4 shRNA adenovirus-treated C57Bl/6 mice;
control, LCN13, TSC22D4, TSC22D4 plus LCN13 adenovirus-treated BKS.Cg-
Dock7m þ / þ Leprdb/J (000642) mice. Gene expression profiling was performed
using arrays of Mouse Genome 430 2.0 and murine MoGene-2_0-st-type from
Affymetrix. Biotinylated sense-strand DNA was then prepared according to the
Affymetrix standard labeling protocol. Afterwards, the hybridization on the chip
was performed on a GeneChip Hybridization oven 640, then dyed in the GeneChip
Fluidics Station 450 and thereafter scanned with a GeneChip Scanner 3000.
All of the equipment used was from the Affymetrix-Company. A Custom CDF
(Microarray Lab, Dept. of Psychiatry/Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience
Institute, University of Michigan, MI, USA) Version 17 with Entrez-IDs based gene
definitions was used to annotate the arrays. Raw data were log2 transformed,
quantile-normalized and RMA background corrected. Differential gene expression
was analysed based ANOVA, using a commercial software package SAS JMP7
Genomics, version 6, from SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). A false positive
rate of a ¼ 0.05 with FDR correction was taken as the level of significance. Gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to determine whether defined lists (or sets)
of genes exhibit a statistically significant bias in their distribution within a ranked
gene list. Pathways belonging to various cell functions such as cell cycle or apop-
tosis were obtained from public external databases (KEGG, http://www.genome.
jp/kegg/).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. Mouse liver was crosslinked in 1% for-
maldehyde for 15 min, followed by quenching with 1/20 volume of 2.5 M glycine
solution, and two washes with 1 � PBS. Nuclear extracts were prepared by dounce
homogenization in cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA,
1% SDS, protease inhibitor cocktail). Chromatin fragmentation was performed by
sonication in ChIP-SDS lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, 1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA,
pH7.5) using the Bioruptor (Diagenode), and Flag-tagged or endogenous
TSC22D4proteins were immunoprecipitated in ChIP dilution buffer (50 mM Tris,
155 mM NaCl, 1.1% Triton X-100, 0.11% Na-deoxycholate, 1 mM PMSF and
complete protease 3 inhibitor tablet, pH7.5) using an anti-Flag (#F3165, Sigma) or
two distinct TSC22D4antibodies (ab76915, Abcam,; SAB2105343, Sigma-Aldrich),
respectively. Cross-linking was reversed overnight at 65 �C, and DNA isolated
using phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. Precipitated DNA was analysed using
Illumina Hi-Seq 2000 for sequencing or real-time PCR against specific regions
within the LCN13 locus. Each sample was measured in duplicates and the mean
Ct-value was calculated. Each mean value was then normalized to the Ct-value of
the respective input DNA Ct-value for the same PCR assay (DCt) according to the
following formula: DCt ¼ (Ct[ChIP]–(Ct[Input]–Log2(input dilution factor))) with
input dilution factor ¼ 1/(fraction of input saved). Fraction of input equals the
amount of input protein that was used for DNA purification divided by the amount
that was used to make the IP. Next the % input was calculated for each ChIP
fraction (linear conversion of the normalized ChIP DCt) by using the following
formula: % input ¼ 2( � DCt) which was eventually normalized to background
(mock IP) Ct value using the following formula: DDCt[ChIP/Mock] ¼ DCt[ChIP]
–DCt[Mock]. The IP fold enrichment above the sample specific background was
finally calculated as follows: IP fold enrichment ¼ 2( � DDCt[ChIP/Mock]). This
calculation allows the ChIP data to be normalized to both mock input as well
as background levels. ChIP primers were as follows:
Peak1: fragment size: 225; forward 50-
GGAGAGCACAGATGGCATCTACCTA-30; reverse 50-TCAAGCCTTTGAGAG
TTCCATGCCA-30
Peak2: fragment size: 245 bp; forward 50-GACGTGTAGACCTCAATGAGTG
CAT-30; reverse 50-CCAGATCCCAGAGTACTGTAGGAGA-30
Peak3: fragment size 216 bp; forward 50-CTTCTGAAGCATGCAGGGCTGG
ATCAT-30; reverse 50-TTGGGTGAGGCAGGCACACAGTAT-30
Peak4: fragment size 207 bp; forward 50-CACTTGCTGCTCTTCCAGAGGAC
TCAA-30; reverse 50-TGGCCCTCATAAGCAGAGTCTAGATT-30
Cell culture and transient transfections. Plasmids carrying TSC22D4-binding
sites within the LCN13 locus were cloned into pGL3prom Luc vector (Promega) by
standard PCR using primer pairs used for the ChIP-PCR. Murine Hepa 1-6 cells
(ATCC) were maintained in DMEM-high glucose (#11995, Gibco) supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37�C in a humidified
atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For luciferase assay transfections, calcium phos-
phate precipitation method was used as described (200 ng reporter plasmid per
well)26. Where indicated, expression plasmids encoding TSC22D4-specific or
non-specific shRNA were co-transfected (400 ng plasmid per well, respectively).
Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection for luciferase assays. The luciferase
activity was normalized to beta galactosidase activity.
C2C12 myoblasts (ATCC) were differentiated into mature myotubes as
described27. Mature myotubes were incubated with 200 nM recombinant LCN13
from two different sources (BioCat and R&D Systems,) for 3 h and cells were
stimulated with insulin (30 nM) for 15 min before harvesting for western blot
analysis as described below.
Cell lysis and protein analysis. Proteins were extracted from frozen organ
samples or cultured cells following lysis in ice cold lysis buffer A (50 mM
Tris pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5 % Triton X, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM
Na3V04, 1 mM NaF, 1 mg ml � 1 pepstatin A and 1 mM DTT). Western blot assays
were performed using antibodies specific for TSC22D4 (home-made TSC22D4
polyclonal antibody was generated and purified by PINEDA Antibody Service
(Berlin, Germany), LCN13 (AF7974, R&D Systems; sc-164876, Santa Cruz
Antibodies), p-Akt (S473) (#9271, CST), p-Akt (T308) (#13038, CST), Akt
(#9272 ,CST), p-GSK3 beta (S9) (#89336,CST), GSK3 beta (#9315, CST), Glut4
(#07-1404, Millipore), VCP (ab11433, Abcam), p-Foxo1 (S256) (#9461, CST),
Foxo1 (#2880 CST). For TSC22D4 antibody generation, a TSC22D4 peptide was
coupled via an N-terminal cysteine to the carrier protein maleimide-activated
mariculture keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). Antipeptide antibodies were
affinity purified from rabbit serum by positive selection on antigen peptide.
Immunoblots were developed using ECL reagent (#RPN2106, Amersham) or
ECL Prime for weaker signals (#RPN2236, Amersham) and detected digitally
with a BioRad ChemiDoc Imaging System or with autoradiography films. For
digitally acquired images quantification was performed using the ImageLab
software. Scanned autoradiography films were quantified using the ImageJ
software. For some figures, unrelated lanes were cropped out and flanking lanes
were put side by side using Adobe Photoshop. We indicated this kind of a
modification with a thin, vertical black line. Full size images are provided
in Supplementary Fig. 7. Cell lines were regularly tested for mycoplasma
contamination as required by in-house policies.
Blood metabolites. Serum levels of glucose and triglycerides (TAGs) were
determined using an automatic glucose monitor (One Touch, Lifescan, Germany)
or commercial kits (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany; RANDOX, Northern Ireland;
WAKO, Germany), respectively. Insulin levels were determined using a mouse
insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Mercodia, Sweden).
HOMA-IR was calculated using the following formula: HOMA-IR (mmol l � 1 �
mU ml � 1) ¼ fasting glucose (mmol l � 1) � fasting insulin (mU ml � 1)/22.5.
HOMA-ISI was calculated using the following formula ¼ 10,000/(SQRT (fasting
glucose (mmol l � 1) � fasting insulin (mU ml � 1) � (mean glucose (mmol l � 1) �
mean insulin (mU ml � 1)).
For HbA1c determination 20 ml of whole blood were homogenized in 80 ml ice-
cold A. dest., incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 15,000g for 10 min at
4 �C. Ten microlitre of the resulting supernatant were transferred to HPLC vials
containing 125 ml of 20 mM Bis-Tris, 2 mM KCN (pH 6.9). The HbA1c fraction

 (HPLC: PolyCAT A column (35 mm � 4.6 mm, 3 m, 1,500 Å) from PolyLC Inc.
(USA) on a LaChrom Elite HPLC System from Hitachi High-Technologies
Corporation (Japan) was identified by comparison to the retention time of pure
standard of haemoglobin. The HbA1c fraction was quantified as % of non-glycated
haemoglobin by calculating the ratio of HbA1c and Hb0 peak areas.
Tissue lipid extraction. Hepatic lipids were extracted as described previously28,
and TAG and total cholesterol content was determined using commercial kits as
above. Values were calculated as milligrams (TAG and cholesterol) per gram wet
tissue.
Human studies. We investigated TSC22D4 mRNA expression in liver tissue
samples obtained from 66 extensively characterized Caucasian obese and lean men
and women who underwent open abdominal surgery for Roux en Y bypass, sleeve
gastrectomy, elective cholecystectomy or explorative laparotomy. With oral glucose
tolerance tests, we identified individuals with type 2 diabetes (n ¼ 26) or normal
glucose tolerance (n ¼ 40). The phenotypic characterization of the cohort has been
extensively described previously29. Insulin sensitivity was assessed using the
euglycaemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp method as described previously30. All
baseline blood samples were collected between 8:00 and 10:00 after an overnight
fast. All study protocols have been approved by the Ethics Committee of the
University of Leipzig (363-10-13122010 and 017-12-230112). All participants gave
written informed consent before taking part in the study.
Statistical analysis. For each experiment, means and s.e.m. or s.d. (specified in
Figure Legends) of parameters measured were determined. Statistical analyses were
performed using Student’s t-test in one-factorial designs. Correlation was deter-
mined using Pearson’s correlation coefficient; F-test was applied to determine
significance. For multi-factorial study designs, two-way ANOVA was used when
appropriate. Holm–Sidak post hoc was applied when significant differences were
found with an overall significance level ¼ 0.05. All analyses were carried out with
SigmaPlot v.12 software or GraphPad Prism.
