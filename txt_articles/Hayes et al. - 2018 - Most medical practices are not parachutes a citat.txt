n a widely cited 2003 BMJ article, the authors made the 
tongue-in-cheek observation that there are no random-
ized trials of parachutes.1 In an era in which proponents 
of evidence-based medicine increasingly rely on randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) to show treatment efficacy, Smith 
and Pell1 argued that some medical practices are so benefi-
cial that it would be silly to subject them to an RCT. The 
use of a parachute during free fall, such as a controlled jump 
from an airplane, is an example. Without the use of a para-
chute, the chance of death approaches nearly 100%, 
although there are scattered case reports of people surviving 
such a fall.2 With a parachute, the risk of death decreases 
dramatically, with recent estimates of 1.1 deaths per 
100 000 jumps, a rate of 0.0011%.3 Of course, there are sev-
eral limits to the parachute analogy in medicine. The first 
difference is etiology. Falling from an airplane has only 
1 causal pathway leading to harm. In contrast, most human 
diseases have multifactorial etiologies,4 and any 1 practice 
may be unlikely to single-handedly reverse the outcome. 
The second limitation is the effect size. Parachutes improve 
survival from nearly 0% to nearly 100%. Empirical analyses 
show that few medical practices offer so large a magnitude of 
benefit. For instance, in a review of over 80 000 medical

Background: In a 2003 paper in BMJ, the authors made the tongue-in-cheek observation that there are no randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) of parachutes. This paper has been widely read, cited and used to argue that RCTs are impractical or unnecessary for 
some medical practices. We performed a study to identify and evaluate claims that a medical practice is akin to a parachute.
Methods: Using Google Scholar, we identified all citations to the 2003 paper. We searched for claims that a specific practice was 
akin to a parachute. For each practice, we identified the desired outcome of the practice, and searched Google Scholar and 
ClinicalTrials.gov for RCTs that were conducted, ongoing, halted, planned or unpublished.
Results: Of 822 articles citing the original paper, 35 (4.1%) argued that a medical practice was akin to a parachute. Eighteen of the 
35 (51%) concerned mortality or live birth, and 17 (49%) concerned a lesser outcome. For 22 practices (63%), we identified 1 or 
more RCTs: in 6 cases (27%), the trials showed a statistically significant benefit of the practice; in 5 (23%), the trials rejected the 
practice; in 5 (23%), the trials had mixed results; in 2 (9%), the trials were halted; and in 4 (18%), the trials were ongoing. Effect size 
was calculated for 5 of the 6 practices for which RCTs gave positive results, and the absolute risk reduction ranged from 11% to 
30.8%, corresponding to a number needed to treat of 3–9.
Interpretation: Although there is widespread interest regarding the BMJ paper arguing that randomized trials are not necessary 
for practices of clear benefit, there are few analogies in medicine. Most parachute analogies in medicine are inappropriate, incor-
rect or misused.

practices from the Cochrane database, Pereira and col-
leagues5 found only 1 medical practice that reliably had a 
large effect on overall mortality, and the absolute risk reduc-
tion (ARR) of this practice was about 33%.6
Despite the limits to the parachute analogy, the article by 
Smith and Pell1 has gained popularity in the medical commu-
nity and is often used to criticize the need for RCTs of a spe-
cific practice. For instance, in a 2016 update to guidelines put 
forth by the US Department of Agriculture and Department 
of Health and Human Services, daily flossing was no longer 
recommended, as it lacked rigorous data showing benefit.7 In 
opposition, Holmes8 argued that long-term flossing was akin 
to a parachute and may not ethically be tested in randomized 
fashion. Whether daily flossing is a parachute may be debated, 
and the analogy may be exaggerated. We performed a study 
to determine how often researchers claim their medical prac-
tice is a parachute when it is in fact no such thing.
Methods
We identified on Google Scholar all articles that cite the paper 
by Smith and Pell.1 Our search was conducted from Jan. 1 to 
Mar. 31, 2016. We selected Google Scholar because of its 
extensive citation network and coverage,9 which are known to 
be superior compared to other citation engines, particularly its 
citation analysis.10,11 One reviewer (M.J.H.) screened titles and 
abstracts of identified articles for full-text review, excluding all 
articles in languages other than English, published in non–
peer-reviewed journals or not related to human clinical medi-
cine (e.g., veterinary medicine). Selected full-text articles were 
individually reviewed in full by 2 authors (M.J.H. and V.P); as 
there were no disagreements, all subsequent analyses were 
based on the reviews of 1 reviewer (M.J.H.). We included arti-
cles that used the paper by Smith and Pell1 to argue that a spe-
cific medical practice was like a parachute in that it could not 
ethically or practically be tested in an RCT. We did not 
include articles that used the paper to argue against the princi-
ples of evidence-based medicine in general. We defined a 
medical practice as any medication, procedure or system-based 
change intended to help prevent or treat a medical condition.
For all included articles, we searched Medline for RCTs or 
systematic reviews of RCTs that had investigated the subject 
referenced by the article. If multiple large RCTs were readily 
identifiable, they were each included in our analysis. A 
detailed search strategy for these RCTs is given in Appendix 1 
(available at www.cmajopen.ca/content/6/1/E31/suppl/DC1), 
and all articles selected were reviewed by M.J.H. and V.P. For 
these RCTs, we ascertained whether studies gave a positive 
result (net benefit of the proposed practice), negative result 
(no benefit or net harm of the proposed practice) or mixed 
result (inconsistent evidence supporting the use of the pro-
posed practice). For practices for which no RCT could be 
found, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov to identify any ongoing 
or unpublished RCTs available. For studies with no published 
or unpublished RCTs, we summarized the nature of the prac-
tice, and M.J.H. and V.P. determined whether an RCT was 
clinically feasible.
Statistical analysis
We performed descriptive statistics. We calculated the ARR 
by subtracting the risk in the control arm from that in the 
experimental arm at whatever time point was reported by the 
author.
Ethics approval
This study of published reports did not require institutional 
board review approval. A protocol can be requested from the 
corresponding author.
Results
At the time of our investigation, the article by Smith and Pell1 
had 822 citations on Google Scholar. Of the 822 articles, 35 
(4.3%) directly compared a medical practice to a parachute or 
used the parachute argument to defend implementation of 
that practice (Figure 1). These were included in subsequent 
analysis. We did not identify any prior citation analyses for 
the article by Smith and Pell.1
Of the 35 medical practices, 22 (63%) involved RCTs that 
were completed, ongoing, halted or planned (Table 1). Exam-
ples include stenting for renal artery stenosis, insulin ana-
logues for the treatment of type 1 diabetes, simulation train-
ing for providers working in critical care medicine and 
metastasectomy for isolated pulmonary metastatic colorectal 
cancer. In 6 cases (27%), RCTs showed a statistically signifi-
cant benefit of the practice; in 5 (23%), RCTs rejected the 
practice; in 5 (23%), RCTs gave mixed results; in 2 (9%),

Mortality or live birth was the clinical outcome of interest 
for 18/35 practices (51%). A lesser outcome, including infec-
tion control, reduced diabetic complications, cardiovascular 
events, clearance of parasites, pain or discomfort, weight 
gain, lead migration and effective dental restoration, was the 
outcome of interest for the remaining 17 practices (49%) 
(Figure 2).
Among the 6 practices with positive evidence in RCTs, the 
ARR could be calculated for 5 and ranged from 11% to 
30.8%, corresponding to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 
3–9. Notably, 3 of the 5 studies concerned mortality or live 
birth, and 2 reported the ARR for other outcomes.
Interpretation
Over a decade after publication of the article by Smith and 
Pell,1 which concluded that RCTs of parachutes or other 
highly effective practices would be ludicrous, we found few 
papers citing the article that argued that a medical practice is a 
parachute. Among those practices, only half referred to a 
practice whose clinical outcome was mortality or live birth. Of 
identified practices, more than half have been tested in an 
RCT, which undermines the claim that the practice is a para-
chute. Among the remaining practices, RCTs seem possible, 
even desirable, for several.
In this respect, our findings are similar to those of other 
empirical analyses. Glasziou and colleagues73 compiled a list 
of 16 examples of treatments that are universally considered 
beneficial and that lack randomized study. Djulbegovic74 
extended this list to nearly 50 examples. Yet what must be 
acknowledged is that this set of interventions is a tiny fraction 
of all medical practices: as there are at least 80 000 practices,5 
50 practices account for just 0.06% of medical interventions.
The proportion of purported parachutes for which RCTs 
gave a positive result in our study, 50% if mixed trial results 
are interpreted as positive, is similar to the reported rate of 
trials with positive results in the setting of genuine therapeutic 
uncertainty, just over 50%.75 This suggests that analogizing a 
medical practice to a parachute is done for practices that are, 
on average, no more likely to be beneficial than a typical med-
ical practice tested in randomized fashion.
Moreover, previous parachutes in medicine have been 
shown to be overstated. The philosopher of science John 
Worrall commented, after listing several medical treatments, 
including appendectomy for acute appendicitis, “no RCT has 
ever been performed on any of these treatments and none 
presumably ever will.”76 Yet there are now 4 RCTs of appen-
dectomy versus antibiotics,77–80 which suggests that there may 
be a subset of patients who can be spared surgery. Another 
example is precision oncology. Experts have claimed that the 
use of next-generation sequencing to pair patients with cancer 
with targeted therapies is a medical practice of such great 
promise that RCTs are unethical.81 To date, 1 RCT has been 
conducted for this practice, yielding negative results.82 In both 
of these cases, the presence of a RCT, particularly one that 
gives a negative result, undermines the parachute analogy.
In cases in which the magnitude of benefit was estimable, we 
found NNT values of 3–9 and ARR values of 11%–30.8%. 
These gains are smaller than those with parachutes, which have 
ARR values greater than 99% and NNT values approaching 1. 
These results suggest that, even when RCTs support the use of 
the practice, the use of the parachute analogy is inappropriate.
Although more RCTs are being performed per annum 
than ever before,83 the idea of the RCT as the pinnacle of 
evidence-based medicine has been criticized.84 Moreover, 
there is growing interest in the use of observational data, 
including big data and real-world data, to make causal infer-
ences about the efficacy of novel treatments.85,86 One justifica-
tion for this interest is that it may not be feasible or ethical to 
conduct RCTs for highly promising medical practices. Our 
results provide a reassuring note. Few medical practices have 
large treatment effects,5 and even practices believed to be 
parachutes often are not.
Limitations
Although we performed an exhaustive search of references to 
the seminal paper by Smith and Pell1 using a search engine 
with the widest citation network,10,11 we may not have cap-
tured all instances in which researchers likened a particular 
practice to a parachute, as many such instances may not have 
been captured by the use of a single search engine or may 
have predated the 2003 paper.
Second, and notably, only a small proportion of papers cit-
ing the article by Smith and Pell1 drew a specific comparison 
to a medical practice. This is largely in part because many 
researchers cite the paper to criticize generally the importance 
of RCTs. Nevertheless, this fact is also noteworthy. In over a 
decade since publication of the article, and although it has 
generated widespread discussion and interest, few citing 
papers argue that a practice in medicine is akin to a parachute.

Third, our paper does not imply that RCTs are always 
feasible, possible, necessary or ethical. We tried to be as 
objective as possible in our determination of which practices 
could be tested in RCTs in the future, but we acknowledge 
the subjective nature of this assessment and the inherent 
challenges of performing rigorous RCTs. In fact, it is inevita-
ble that there will be situations in medicine in which deci-
sions have to be made in the absence of randomized data.87 
Moreover, as noted by Djulbegovic,74 there are indeed exam-
ples of practices universally thought beneficial in the absence 
of RCTs. However, our investigation provides further evi-
dence that the number of such practices is few. We also pro-
vide a cautionary note: a researcher’s belief that an interven-
tion is a parachute seems a poor predictor of actual parachute 
practices.
Conclusion
Although there is widespread interest in the idea that some 
medical practices are like parachutes — with a magnitude of 
benefit so large and obvious that RCTs are unnecessary — 
few biomedical authors compare a specific medical practice to 
a parachute. When they do, over half refer to a practice that 
has been tested with an RCT, and half refer to an outcome of 
lesser importance than overall survival, findings that under-
mine the claim that the practice is a parachute. When RCTs 
have been conducted and estimate effect sizes, practices analo-
gized to parachutes have ARR values that are smaller and 
NNT values that are larger than those for parachutes.
