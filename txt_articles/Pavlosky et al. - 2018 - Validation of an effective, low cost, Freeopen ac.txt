Abstract
The modern acoustic stethoscope is a useful clinical tool used to detect subtle, pathological
changes in cardiac, pulmonary and vascular sounds. Currently, brand-name stethoscopes
are expensive despite limited innovations in design or fabrication in recent decades. Conse-
quently, the high cost of high quality, brand name models serves as a barrier to clinicians
practicing in various settings, especially in low- and middle-income countries. In this publica-
tion, we describe the design and validation of a low-cost open-access (Free/Libre) 3D-
printed stethoscope which is comparable to the Littmann Cardiology III for use in low-access
clinics.
Introduction
Since its introduction in 1819 by Rene
´ Laennec[1], the acoustic stethoscope has been an inte-
gral part of clinical medicine. Despite the lack of major structural design innovations over
recent decades, modern stethoscopes can be an expensive part of the physician’s armamentar-
ium, often costing several hundred US dollars. The high cost of modern stethoscopes remains
a significant barrier to physicians and allied health professionals practicing in the developed
word and in low- and middle-income countries, where few affordable high-quality options
exist. Traditionally, the selection of a stethoscope often does not involve the acoustic properties
of the model[2] with most users selecting an expensive brand-name stethoscope such as the
Littmann Cardiology III or other premium brands. However, previous studies that compared
stethoscope brands have concluded that cost does not correlate with better diaphragm sound
quality at relevant frequencies, compared with lower-cost alternatives[3,4]. While other 3D
printed stethoscope models that would be low-cost to produce can be found online[5–15], we
are not aware of any that have been used clinically or research-validated.
Numerous groups have previously attempted to standardize methods to determine the effi-
cacy of acoustic stethoscope models[2,16–20], but currently no accepted standardized modal-
ity exists. Consequently, the performance of any acoustic stethoscope is little more than the

from the University of Western Ontario’s medical
 manufacturer’s claim or the subjective opinion of the user. Some groups have attempted to
objectively compare acoustic stethoscope models and currently two competing methods of
measuring frequency response exist. The first method uses air coupling to transmit frequen-
cies[2–4,16,17] while the other uses a phantom to simulate vibrations of the chest wall
[19,21,22]. These methods allow investigators to quantitatively compare the sensitivity of a
stethoscope model compared with another.
In this article, we describe the construction and validation of a low cost, Free/open access
3D printed acoustic stethoscope—referred to here as the ‘Glia model’. The aim of this research
is to give low budget health care systems affordable access to an effective stethoscope for a cost
under $5 USD and to contribute to the body of literature by ensuring this stethoscope is rigor-
ously tested and released as Free/open access hardware. To achieve this, we utilized 3D print-
ing, a technology that is advancing rapidly and becoming increasingly inexpensive[23]. 3D
printing technology has been used by others, especially for work on prosthetics[24–26], splints
[27,28] and preoperative planning[29]. It has also been proposed as a partial solution to prob-
lems in supply chain management during disasters[30], such as by Global Humanitarian Lab
[31] and Field Ready[32]. The flexibility of 3D printing technology also allows users to aug-
ment our design to fit their own needs. We also attempt to make our bills of material, con-
struction methodology and validation methods accessible and low cost, allowing others to
validate our design independently with ease.
Methods
Stethoscope design
Design of the Glia model 3D printed stethoscopes was done using Free/Open Source Software
(FOSS) so as to keep costs low and allow others easy access to examine and modify code. Crys-
talSCAD (https://github.com/Joaz/CrystalScad, Germany) was used to create digital models of
the stethoscope head, two ear tubes and an ear plug mold due to its ability to create complex
shapes in a way that was not possible with OpenSCAD at the time. OpenSCAD (http://
openscad.org, Canada) was used to create digital models of the Y-piece, stethoscope ring and
spring (Fig 1A). Since its original creation as documented in this paper, the eartubes have been
completely ported to OpenSCAD. The stethoscope head is presently a hybrid of CrystalSCAD
and OpenSCAD. As the ear plug mold is no longer used in our current production process, its
archived version also remains in CrystalSCAD.
Other accessory hardware is required, such as the plastic diaphragm, tubing and ear buds.
These are listed in Table 1.

Stethoscope printing and assembly
Each part was printed on a commodity 3D printer (Prusa Mk II, 1.75 mm filament diameter,
0.4 mm nozzle diameter, no scaffolding or support) using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
(ABS) with 100% infill as indicated and 0.2 mm layer height. A 40 cm silicone 12 mm outer
diameter (OD), 8 mm inner diameter (ID) tube was attached between the stethoscope head
and the larger bore of the Y piece. Two 9 cm silicone 6 mm OD, 4 mm ID tubes were attached
between the smaller bore of the Y piece and the ear tubes. A diaphragm was cut from a Staples
brand PVC report cover (Swing-lock report cover, clear with black spine; UPC 718103160223)
by turning a sharp caliper and creating a circular diaphragm with a 40 mm diameter. This dia-
phragm was attached to the stethoscope head with a printed ABS ring. A printed ABS truss
that has some spring properties by design is used as a spring for the ear tubes.

 The earbuds are generic earbuds from commodity earbud-style headphones that are
widely available and of negligible cost. The final construction of the current model can be
seen in Fig 1C.
Costs in Table 1 were calculated using the density of PA757 ABS (1.05 g/cm3)[33] and the
part weight, which is calculated using version 1.3.0-dev of the Slic3r software (https://slic3r.org,
Italy). We assumed the price of 12 lbs (5.4545 kg) of virgin PA757 ABS pellets to be $38.99 USD
[34]. Commercial ABS filament was assumed to cost $23.96 USD/kg[35]. Electricity costs were
estimated using the Ontario Energy Board’s current mid-peak rates[36,37] multiplied by the
printer’s expected electricity use based on measurements of a similar printer with similar temper-
atures[38] printing for four hours then multiplied by 0.8 for an approximate conversion to US
currency. This number was rounded up to the nearest cent. The energy costs of filament extru-
sion are negligible when estimated based on previous reporting[39] and were thus not included.
Acoustic transfer
The frequency response of Glia model stethoscopes, compared with the Littmann Cardiology
III, was determined using an experimental setup modeled from a phantom-based frequency
response setup previously described[19]. A latex balloon filled with 2 L (2000 g) of water was
used as a phantom and each stethoscope was applied to the surface by hand. Phantom excita-
tions were supplied by an external vibrating speaker which was placed in contact with the bal-
loon and sound was played at 86 Hz intervals between 0 and 5000 Hz (white noise) for 15
seconds. The output of each stethoscope was recorded by a microphone which was placed in a
silicon tube attached to the stethoscope head for spectral analysis. Spectral analyses such as
these have been used successfully in the past to analyze breath sounds recorded from individu-
als with lung pathology[40]. The simplicity of this design was intended to allow other users to
validate our design independently.
Results
After many iterations, we successfully designed a working stethoscope, known as the Glia
model (Fig 1), at a total cost of $2.83 USD using recycled ABS pellets. A bill of materials and
cost breakdown can be found in Table 1.
We compared the Glia stethoscope to the Littmann Cardiology III using a phantom, as
described in the methods. At all frequencies tested, the Glia model performed similarly to the
Cardiology III (Fig 2A). The difference in attenuation (dB) of the Glia model to the Littmann

 Fig 2. Calibration and comparison of 3D printed Glia model stethoscopes to the Littmann Cardiology III. Stethoscope output
responses were measured using the equipment setup described in the methods. Each stethoscope model recorded input sound at
multiple frequencies and the change in amplitude between input and recorded sound was documented (lower log attenuation is
better) for each stethoscope (Fig 2A). The decibel difference in attenuation (Glia minus Littmann) is shown across all frequencies
tested where values above 0 dB indicate the Glia model attenuated less sound (Fig 2B).

Discussion
Using a phantom-based method, we show here that the Glia model stethoscope, at a cost of
$2.40 USD, is comparable to the Littmann Cardiology III across a range of spectral frequencies
from 86 Hz to 5000 Hz, making it a low-cost, suitable alternative to those who cannot access or
afford a high-cost model.
The stethoscope is one of the most widely used instruments in modern medicine, allowing
clinicians to detect subtle changes in heart, lung and vascular sounds. Despite a lack of major
innovation in design or fabrication since Dr. Littmann patented his stethoscope in 1963, the
acoustic stethoscope remains an expensive piece of equipment that creates a cost barrier for
physicians practicing in low- and middle-income countires. This study aims to create a vali-
dated high quality acoustic stethoscope at a cost under $5 USD.
The quality and intensity of the sound reaching the earpiece from the diaphragm is depen-
dent on nearly every piece of the stethoscope as well as the physiology of the user. These vari-
ables have been previously summarized[3] and include the size and volume of the bell[18,41];
hardness of the inner cavity of the bell[42]; improperly fitted components allowing air leaks
and loss of sound[41]; the thickness, size and tautness of the diaphragm and the interior
smoothness, rigidity, length and diameter of the tubing[43,44]. Additional user related factors
include improperly fitted ear pieces that allow air exchange[4,41,44,45]; anatomical variations
of the auditory canal of the user[45]; background noise[46] and training[47]. Many of these
variables needed to be considered when designing the Glia model stethoscope, particularly
physical properties such as channel diameter through the 3D printed parts and infill percent-
age, which ultimately determines the density and hardness of the parts. We also tried several
printing materials including poly-lactic acid (PLA) and ABS. Of particular challenge was creat-
ing the interface between the ear tube and the spring to prevent rotation when the ear tubes
were pulled apart.
As previously mentioned, no standard method of determining the acoustic response of
stethoscope models currently exists. Previous studies have attempted to objectively quantify
stethoscope efficacy[19,21,22,41] and previous comparisons between brands indicate that no
significant correlation between cost and quality exists[3,4]. However, there may be some sub-
jective decrease in efficacy when using low-quality disposable stethoscopes[47].
The Littmann Cardiology III has recently become unavailable. Its replacement, the Litt-
mann Cardiology IV costs $190 USD[48], which is comparable to other brand name stetho-
scopes such as the Welch Allyn Harvey Elite ($150 USD[49]). Ultimately, however, the
usefulness of any stethoscope is dependent on user preference and so we encourage those with
access to a 3D printer to build and test our model independently. The protocol listed in the
methods has been purposely designed to be replicable using commonly available materials.
Any printer capable of printing in ABS should be able to create our device, including RepRap
printer designs used by our group[50]. Printers of sufficient quality and reliability can be easily
obtained or built internationally for less than $1,000 USD[51].
The Glia model stethoscope is a class I medical device according to Health Canada and the
FDA. In Canada, a non-profit company was incorporated to manufacture stethoscopes and
has received a Medical Device Establishment Licence from Health Canada. The stethoscope is
in clinical use in London, Canada at the London Health Sciences Centre. It has also been
trialed and was gradually introduced in the Gaza strip, an area with extremely limited access to
medical devices. Hospitals in Gaza are self-sufficient producers of these stethoscopes.

 Low cost does not mean low quality
This work aimed to produce a stethoscope of comparable quality to those premium-brand
devices unobtainable due to economic, political or military factors. We believe this aim was
achieved as shown in the results above. This work is significant in both developed and low-
and middle-income countries (LMICs) as it introduces two cost-saving innovations: the use of
plastic and 3D printing to create a product equal to metal alternatives and the dissemination of
plans and bills of material through a Free and open source license.
Our results suggest that the use of inexpensive techniques to produce medical devices does
not necessitate the lowering of quality standards. This presents a challenge to an implicit
assumption found in some literature and organizations that lower standards may be necessary
for the developing world[52,53]. An example pertinent to 3D printing is the use of 3D printed
upper limb prosthetics based on the e-Nable project[26] in LMICs. These prosthetics have
been found to be inadequate in many important activities as per a standardized assessment
[54]. Despite this, the implicit argument is that poor quality devices are acceptable because of
the present lack of access to devices[53].
Future research
This project was the first of several planned open access medical device projects. Future plans
include expanding access by providing validated models of other pieces of medical equipment,
including pulse oximeters, tourniquets, otoscopes and ECG machines, allowing health institu-
tions to sustainably produce affordable, high quality equipment for many clinicians.
