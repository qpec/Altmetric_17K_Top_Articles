AIMS
To investigate the association between use of β-blockers and β-blocker characteristics – selectivity, lipid solubility, intrinsic
sympathetic activity (ISA) and CYP2D6 enzyme metabolism – and fall risk.
METHODS
Data from two prospective studies were used, including community-dwelling individuals, n = 7662 (the Rotterdam Study) and
2407 (B-PROOF), all aged ≥55 years. Fall incidents were recorded prospectively. Time-varying β-blocker use was determined using
pharmacy dispensing records. Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for age and sex were applied to determine the
association between β-blocker use, their characteristics – selectivity, lipid solubility, ISA and CYP2D6 enzyme metabolism – and fall
risk. The results of the studies were combined using meta-analyses.
RESULTS
In total 2917 participants encountered a fall during a total follow-up time of 89 529 years. Meta-analysis indicated no
association between use of any β-blocker, compared to nonuse, and fall risk, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.97 [95% confidence interval
(CI) 0.88–1.06]. Use of a selective β-blocker was also not associated with fall risk, HR = 0.92 (95%CI 0.83–1.01). Use of a
nonselective β-blocker was associated with an increased fall risk, HR = 1.22 (95%CI 1.01–1.48). Other β-blocker characteristics
including lipid solubility and CYP2D6 enzyme metabolism were not associated with fall risk.
CONCLUSION
Our study suggests that use of a nonselective β-blocker, contrary to selective β-blockers, is associated with an increased fall risk in an older
population. In clinical practice, β-blockers have been shown effective for a variety of cardiovascular indications. However, fall risk should be
considered when prescribing a β-blocker in this age group, and the pros and cons for β-blocker classes should be taken into consideration.

 WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT
• Beta-blocker use has been associated with fall risk, although literature is contradictory.
• Pharmacological and adverse effects may vary between β-blocker characteristics.
• Therefore, the association between β-blocker characteristics – adrenergic receptor selectivity, lipid solubility, intrinsic
sympathetic activity (ISA) and CYP2D6 enzyme metabolism – and fall risk should be evaluated.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
• Use of a nonselective β-blocker, in contrast to selective β-blockers, is associated with an increased fall risk in an older
population.
• Lipid solubility and CYP2D6 enzyme metabolism were not associated with fall risk.
• The number of participants using a β-blocker with ISA was limited and therefore an association with fall risk could not be
examined.
Introduction
In the aging population, fall incidents form a growing
healthcare problem [1]. Of those older than 65 years, one in
three encounters at least one fall annually [2]. Falls lead to
significant morbidity and even mortality. Moreover, falls are
associated with reduced quality of life and increased health
care costs [3–5]. One of the risk factors for falls is the use of
certain medication [6, 7], including β-blockers, although
literature is contradictory [7–10]. Beta-blocker use is thought
to result in fall risk by inducing bradycardia, reducing the
cardiac output, inducing hypotension and dizziness [11].
Pharmacological effects and occurrence of adverse effects
may vary between different β-blocking agents. Differences of
β-blocking agents relate for example to their selectivity for
adrenergic receptors, lipid solubility, intrinsic sympathetic
activity (ISA) and their elimination route [11, 12].
Previously, we observed an increased fall risk with the use of
nonselective β-blocking agents [8]. In addition, the more
lipophilic β-blockers may be associated with central nerve
system side effects, such as dizziness and light-headedness [11,
13]. Furthermore, β-blocking agents with ISA might be less
susceptible to cause bradycardia [11]. Regarding the elimination
route, some β-blockers are eliminated through liver metabolism
(e.g.,
metoprolol
and
propranolol),
whereas
others
are
predominantly eliminated by renal excretion (e.g., atenolol)
[11,
12].
For
those
subjected
to
liver
metabolism,
the
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 enzyme plays an important role
[14, 15]. The CYP2D6 gene displays multiple genetic variations,
of which the *4 variant allele is suggested to be of main
importance for Caucasians. The *4 variant results in a
nonfunctional protein [16], and in Caucasians it is responsible
for the majority of poor metabolizer phenotypes [14, 15].
Previous research indicated that metoprolol users with a poor
metabolizers
phenotype,
according
to
their
CYP2D6*4
genotypes, had a lower blood pressure and were at increased risk
for bradycardia [17, 18]. Overall, varying pharmacological
effects of β-blocking agents or individual differences on
clearance may underlie the contradictory literature results.
Our objective was to investigate the association between
use of β-blocker and β-blocker characteristics – selectivity,
lipid solubility, ISA and CYP2D6 enzyme metabolism – and
fall risk. We hypothesized that use of nonselective agents,
lipid soluble agents and those without ISA are associated with
an increased fall risk. In addition, we hypothesized that users
of β-blockers metabolized by CYP2D6 who carry a CYP2D6*4
variant are also at increased risk for fall incidents. These
research questions were investigated in two independent
studies involving community-dwelling older individuals.
Methods
Study population and setting
Data were used from the Rotterdam Study and B-PROOF
(B-vitamins in the PRevention Of Osteoporotic Fractures).
The Rotterdam Study is an ongoing population-based cohort,
executed within a suburb of Rotterdam. Its design, objectives
and methods have been described in detail [19, 20]. Briefly,
the study was initiated in 1989 and 7983 participants aged
≥55 years were included. Subsequently, participants were
interviewed and underwent an extensive set of examinations
that were repeated during the follow-up visits every 4–5 years.
For the current study, participants with pharmacy dispensing
data and validated fall data were included, covering a study
period from 1 May 1991 until 31 December 2010. The
Rotterdam Study has been approved by the medical ethics
committee
according
to
the
‘Wet
Bevolkingsonderzoek
ERGO’ (Population Study Act: Rotterdam Study), executed
by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports of the
Netherlands. All study participants gave written informed
consent to participate in the study and obtain information
from their treating physicians [19, 20].
B-PROOF has also been described in more detail [21]. In
short, it is a multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled,
double-blind trial investigating the efficacy of vitamin B12
and folic acid supplementation on the prevention of fractures
in persons aged ≥65 years. In total, 2919 participants were
included and followed for 2–3 years, covering a study period
from 2008 until 2013. Inclusion criteria were homocysteine
levels of 12–50 μmol l–1, serum creatinine ≤150 μmol l–1,
and no reported malignancies in the past 5 years. For the
current study participants with pharmacy dispensing data
were
included.
The
Medical
Ethics
Committee
of
Wageningen University approved the study protocol, and
the Medical Ethics committees of Erasmus Medical Centre
and VU University Medical Center gave approval for local
feasibility. Before entering the study, all participants gave
written informed consent [21].

 Previous B-PROOF results indicated that the intervention
had no effect on the time to first or second fall, or the number
of falls encountered during the study [22]. For the current
study we therefore used a cohort study design.
Fall incidents
In the Rotterdam Study, serious falls were defined as ‘a fall
leading to a hospital admission or leading to a fracture’. Data
were obtained from a computerized reporting system of the
general practitioners within the Rotterdam Study. Participant
data were also linked to the Dutch National Morbidity
Registration, which contains information of all hospital
admissions. Serious fall data were coded by two members of
the research team and were completed until 2010. The first
serious fall date was defined as the index date. A participant
was
followed
from
the
baseline
date
(date
of
study
enrolment) until the first serious fall (index date), death or
the end of the study period, whichever came first.
In
B-PROOF,
a
fall
incident
was
defined
as
‘an
unintentional change in position resulting in coming to a
rest at a lower level or on the ground’ [23]. Participants
reported fall incidents prospectively on a fall calendar on a
weekly basis. The calendar was returned to the research team
every 3 months. Participants with incomplete or unclear
calendars were contacted by telephone. Participants were
followed until their first fall incident; the Thursday in that
particular week was defined as the index date. Participants
were followed from baseline until the index date, their
drop-out date or the date of their last calendar, date of death,
or the end of the study, whichever came first.
Beta-blocker use
Beta-blocker use was defined according to the Anatomical
Therapeutic
Chemical
(ATC)
code
[24],
C07.
Selective
β-blockers were defined with the ATC codes: C07AB, C07BB,
C07CB, C07DB, C07EB and C07FB. Nonselective β-blockers
were defined as C07AA, C07BA, C07CA, C07DA, C07EA,
C07FA and C07AG. Table 1 lists the characteristics of
individual β-blocking agent, according to lipid solubility,
ISA, and CYP2D6 enzyme metabolism [11, 12].
Five exposure definitions were used in the analyses: i)
β-blocker use overall; ii) selective- and nonselective β-blocker
use; iii) lipophilic and nonlipophilic β-blocker use; iv)
β-blockers with and without ISA; and v) use of β-blockers with
and without CYP2D6 enzyme metabolism.
In both studies, β-blocker use was based on pharmacy
dispensing records. Thereby, we were able to use β-blocker
exposure as a time-varying determinant. In the Rotterdam
Study, these records from the regional pharmacies were
available from 01 January 1991 onwards. More than 95% of
the participants fill their drug prescriptions at one of these
pharmacies.
In B-PROOF, pharmacy dispensing records were obtained
from the Dutch Foundation for Pharmaceutical Statistics, as
previously described [8]. Data were available throughout the
study period of a participant.
The dispensing records contain information regarding
date of dispensing, total amount of drug units per dispensing,
prescribed daily number of units, product name of the drugs
and corresponding ATC code. Current medication use was
defined as use at the time of the fall (on the index date). Past
use was defined as use prior to, but no longer on, the index
date. To investigate a dose–response relation, the average
prescribed daily dose was expressed in standardized defined
daily doses (DDDs). In the Rotterdam Study, we ensured that
all participants had pharmacy dispensing records available
for at least 4 months prior to their study start, to avoid
potential misclassification of exposure.
Covariables
Basis characteristics including age, sex, ethnicity, use of a
walking
aid,
history
of
falls,
smoking
habits,
alcohol
consumption
and
diabetes
were
ascertained
using
a
questionnaire
[19,
21].
During
study
visits,
various
characteristics were measured including weight, height,
blood
pressure,
depressive
symptoms
and
cognitive
performance. Additionally, serum creatinine [19, 21], and
the use of concomitant medication were assessed. As a
measure of physical function, lower limb disability scores
were determined in the Rotterdam Study [25, 26], in
B-PROOF
physical
performance
scores
and
hand-grip
strength were assessed [27, 28]. In the Rotterdam Study, also
orthostatic
hypotension
measures
and
dizziness
were
available [19].

 In the Rotterdam Study, alcohol consumption was based
on food frequency data and reported in g day–1 [29]. In
B-PROOF, alcohol consumption was categorized into light,
moderate and excessive [30]. Diabetes was based on self-
report [19, 21]. Weight and height were measured and were
used to calculate body mass index (kg m–2). Hypertension
was defined as systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg and/or
diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg [31]. In the Rotterdam
Study, depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center
for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (score range
0–60) [32] or in a subsample the Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale (score range 0–21) [33]. In B-PROOF, the
15-item version of the geriatric depression scale was used
[34]. Clinically relevant depressive symptoms were based on
Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale scores
≥16 [35, 36], Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores
≥9 [37], or geriatric depression scale scores ≥5 [38]. Cognitive
performance
was
assessed
by
the
mini-mental
state
examination [39]. Serum creatinine levels were used to
calculate an age-adjusted estimate of the glomerular filtration
rate according to the chronic kidney disease epidemiology
collaboration formula [40]. Concomitant medication use
was assessed with pharmacy dispensing records, and those
considered as potential confounders were; antihypertensive
medication C02, diuretics C03, calcium antagonist C08,
renin-angiotensin agents C09, benzodiazepines N05BA or
N05CD, and antidepressants N06A. Lower-limb disability
scores were assessed using a modified version of the Stanford
Health Assessment Questionnaire [25, 26]. The score was
based on answers to questions regarding rising, walking,
bending, and getting in and out of a car. Disability was
defined as a score of 3 or higher [26]. A physical performance
score was calculated from the results of three physical
function tests: walking test, chair stand test, and the tandem
stand test [28] Physical performance score ranged from 0–12
(low physical performance–high physical performance) [27,
41]. Maximum handgrip strength (kg) was defined as the
highest results of two maximum trials per hand using a
dynamometer (Takei TKK 5401; Takei Scientific Instrument
Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Orthostatic hypotension was defined
as: a decrease of ≥20 mmHg in systolic and/or a decrease of
≥10 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure [42]. Dizziness
symptoms were assessed using a questionnaire [19].
For the Rotterdam Study, baseline fall history, dizziness
and serum creatinine levels were used, and depressive
symptoms were available from the second visit onwards. Data
of the other covariables were available for all follow-up visits,
but to minimize the number missing, the values from the
preceding visit were used.
Genotyping
CYP2D6*4 (rs3892097) allele variants were determined based
on the Illumina 550 (+duo; the Rotterdam Study), and the
Illumina-Omni express array (B-PROOF), and imputation to
1000 Genomes Project (PhaseIv3, March 2012) reference set
[43].
The
imputation
quality
was
0.99.
In
B-PROOF
imputations were only done for Caucasians. For both studies,
the reference group was defined as those with homozygous
major allele carriership (i.e. the absence of a CYP2D6*4
allele).
Statistical analyses
Baseline characteristics were determined for fallers and
nonfallers. Differences between groups were tested using a t
test, a Chi-square test or a Mann–Whitney U test. Deviation
from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was tested using a Chi-
square test for allele frequencies.
Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate
fall hazard ratios (HR) for users compared to nonusers [44].
The model compares the prevalence of exposure to β-blockers
in the incident fall cases on the index date with the exposure
prevalence in all other participants in the cohort on the same
date of follow-up. In this way, cases are censored but noncases
can serve as a reference on multiple occasions until the end of
the study period. This method for cohort analysis with a
Cox proportional hazards analysis with drug use as a time-
varying determinant is valid and has been described earlier
[44]. This analysis was done for the five exposure categories
(i.e., β-blocker use overall, selectivity, lipophilicity, ISA and
CYP2D6
enzyme
metabolism)
separately.
Per
exposure
category
we
stratified
on
β-blocker
characteristic
(e.g.,
nonuse
vs.
selective-
and
nonselective
β-blocker
use).
Nonuse was defined as no current β-blocker use. The models
were adjusted for age and sex (model 1). Covariables were
included in the models if they changed the hazard ratio of
the association between β-blocker use and falls by > 10%
(model 2). For the first exposure, a dose–response relation
was investigated. Dose categories were made according to
median number of prescribed DDDs. In addition, the analysis
of the fifth exposure was stratified on CYP2D6 genotypes. Fall
risk in current users was compared to nonusers, within those
carrying no variant CYP2D6*4 alleles. Likewise, within those
carrying at least one variant CYP2D6*4 allele, fall risk in
current users was compared to nonusers.
The results of the two studies were combined using meta-
analysis. The effect estimates – β’s (log HR) – and their
standard errors were used to calculate the overall effect, and
to investigate the heterogeneity between the studies. Meta-
analyses were done using the R package ‘rmeta’ applying a
random effect model, R version 3.0.3. All other statistical
analyses were done using the statistical software package SPSS
version 21.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) and P-values <0.05
were considered statistically significant.
Finally, sensitivity analyses were applied, in which we
categorized the selectivity β-blocker group into: no β-blocker
use (reference); selective β-blocker use; nonselective; and
nonselective and also high lipophilic β-blocker use. The
lipophilic β-blocker group was categorized into: no β-blocker
use
(reference);
nonlipophilic;
medium
lipophilic;
and
highly lipophilic. In addition, a dose–response relation was
investigated for nonselective β-blockers. Furthermore, an
association
with
falls
for
past
and
current
use
was
investigated for selective and nonselective β-blockers.
Results
Study population
The
total
Rotterdam
Study
population
included
7983
participants. Of those, 7662 had both medication and fall
data, with 6170 having also genetic data. B-PROOF included

2295
 2919 participants, of whom 2407 had medication and fall
data, and 2135 also had genetic data (flow-chart Figure S1).
The Rotterdam population with medication, fall, and genetic
data differed slightly from those without genetic data. Those
without genetic data were slightly older and more likely to:
be female; have a positive fall history; use a walking aid;
tohave a lower mini-mental state examination score; have
depressive symptoms, hypertension, self-reported diabetes
or lower limb disabilities; and be of non-Caucasian origin.
In addition, there were fewer current smokers. In B-PROOF,
those without genetic data were more likely to have self-
reported diabetes.
In the Rotterdam Study the median follow-up time was
11.4 year with an interquartile range of 5.1–17.9 years, and
in B-PROOF it was 1.8 years (0.5–2.0). Table 2 presents the
baseline characteristics for both study populations, separated
on occurrence of a fall during follow-up.
Beta-blocker use and fall risk
In both studies, current and past use of β-blockers was not
associated with fall risk, table 3. For current use – compared
to nonuse – the combined HR was 0.97 [(95% confidence
interval (CI) 0.88–1.06]. The use of selective β-blockers was
also not associated with fall risk, combined HR = 0.92
(95%CI 0.83–1.01). Use of nonselective β-blockers was
associated with an increased fall risk, combined HR = 1.22
(95%CI 1.01–1.48). Use of a lipophilic or nonlipophilic
β-blocker was not associated with fall risk, combined HR was
0.99 (95%CI 0.71–1.37), and HR = 0.99 (95%CI 0.88–1.09)
respectively. In both studies, the hazard ratios were adjusted
for age and sex, as the other considered covariates did not
change the HR by more than 10%. As, in total, there were
only four fall-cases who used a β-blocker with ISA capacity,
the association between β-blockers with and without ISA
could not be investigated.
Dose response relation
In both studies, β-blockers were used in relatively low
dosages, the median number of prescribed DDDs was 0.50.
No dose–response relation was observed. The combined
analyses indicated that those using the median dose or less
– compared to nonuse – had a fall risk of HR = 1.03 (95%CI
0.92–1.16). Those using a dose above the median had a fall
risk of HR = 0.88 (95%CI 0.72–1.08). In addition, there was
no significant linear trend for the dose categories, P = 0.159.
Data of the individual studies are not shown.
Beta-blocker use, fall risk and CYP2D6*4
genotype
In the Rotterdam Study, CYP2D6*4 allele had a frequency of
20%, and in B-PROOF 22%. In both studies, the allele
frequency was in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium.
The association between use of β-blockers, subjected to
CYP2D6 enzyme metabolism or not, and fall risk, was
stratified on CYP2D6*4 genotype. No significant associations
were observed, Table 4.
Only one of the meta-analyses indicated significant
heterogeneity between the studies, I2 varied between 0–4%.
The meta-analyses of nonlipophilic β-blockers indicated
significant heterogeneity, p = 0.04 and I2 = 4%.
Sensitivity analyses
Additional
categorization
of
the
nonselective
β-blocker
group into nonselective, and nonselective highly lipophilic
β-blockers, did not result in materially different results. Use
of nonselective β-blockers – compared to nonuse – was
nonsignificantly associated with an increased fall risk,
combined HR = 1.22 (95%CI 0.97–1.53). Use of nonselective
highly lipophilic β-blockers was not significantly associated
with fall risk, combined HR = 1.23 (95%CI 0.87–1.74).
Likewise, subdividing lipophilic β-blockers into medium
and highly lipophilic β-blockers did not show substantially
different results, combined HR = 0.99 (95%CI 0.85–1.15),
and
HR
=
1.22
(95%CI
0.86–1.71),
respectively.
In
addition, no dose–response relation was observed for non-
selective β-blocker use (data not shown). The combined
analyses indicated that those using the median dose (0.50
DDD) or less – compared to nonuse – had a fall risk of HR = 1.25
(95%CI 0.96–1.62). Those using a dose above the median had
a fall risk of HR = 1.22 (95%CI 0.87–1.69). The results of the
association
for
past
and
current
use
of
selective
and
nonselective β-blockers compared to nonuse are presented in
Table S1. The results indicated no association with fall risk for
past use of selective or nonselective β-blockers. All these
analyses were adjusted for age and sex.
Discussion
In two large older populations, the use of nonselective
β-blockers was associated with an increased fall risk. Use of
selective, lipophilic or β-blockers overall, was not associated
with fall risk. Furthermore, we did not observe an association
between β-blocker use and fall risk across genotypes of CYP2D6.
To our knowledge, our study group is the first to evaluate
the association between β-blocker characteristics and fall risk.
We observed an increased fall risk for current use of
nonselective
β-blockers,
although
there
was
no
dose–
response relation. Furthermore, no association was observed
for selective β-blocker use or β-blocker use overall. These
findings might be explained by the receptor binding profile
and
accompanying
systemic
effects
of
nonselective
β-blockers. Nonselective β-blockers, in addition to binding
to β1-receptors, bind to β2-receptors and some also to
α-receptors. β1-receptors are mainly located in the heart,
while β2-receptors are also present in the lungs, smooth
muscle cells of the peripheral circulation, liver and in skeletal
muscle cells [11, 12, 45]. As a consequence, nonselective
β-blockers not only reduce heart rate and contractility, but
also
induce
peripheral
vasoconstriction,
including
in
blood vessels towards and in skeletal muscle [11, 12].
Contrarily,
β-
and
α-blockers
also
exhibit
vasodilating
properties [11, 12]. In theory, β2-antagonist may as well have
a direct negative effect on skeletal muscle and might thereby
be related to fall risk, as β2-agonist are suggested to have a
positive
effect
on
muscle
function
[46,
47].
Thus,
nonselective β-blockers may be related to fall risk by their
broader range in effects and their potential negative effect
on skeletal muscle.
Another aspect of selective and nonselective β-blockers is
that the indication for use can differ. Selective β-blockers are

 mainly used for hypertension, although metoprolol, for
example, is also used in patients with heart failure or those
who
with
angina
pectoris
or
a
previous
myocardial
infarction.
Nonselective
β-blockers,
by
contrast,
are
contraindicated for asthmatics and diabetics. Sotalol, a
nonselective agent is used for arrhythmias and carvedilol is
used for heart failure, but also for hypertension and angina
pectoris [11, 12, 48]. These potential indication differences

 of β-blockers may be related to fall risk. Nevertheless, our
sensitivity analyses did not indicate an association with fall
risk for past use of selective or nonselective β-blockers. This
suggests that confounding by indication does not play a
major role. If the association was spuriously caused by
confounding by indication, we would expect a similar risk
estimate in past users as in current users.
Within the B-PROOF population we previously observed
an association between nonselective β-blocker use and fall
risk, though then nonselective β-blockers were slightly
differently defined [8]. Currently we also included in α- and
β-blockers, and excluded ocular administered β-blockers.
In previous studies, overall use of β-blockers has been
associated with fall risk [9, 10], but not consistently [7]. In
the studies that reported an association, an increased fall risk
was observed during initiation of use, which was thought to
be due the increased risk of hypotension [9, 10]. We
investigated current use and not initiation of use, which
may partly explain the discrepancy in results.
With respect to the lipophilicity of β-blockers, some
nonselective
β-blockers
are
highly
lipophilic,
such
as
carvedilol and propranolol [11, 12]. Because lipophilic agents
can cross the blood–brain barrier [11, 13], we hypothesized
that their use was associated with more central adverse
effects, including dizziness. Nevertheless, our sensitivity
analyses investigating the use of β-blockers, combining
strong lipophilic and nonselective characteristics, in relation
to fall risk did not result in a different association than for
nonselective β-blockers overall. Thus, our results do not
confirm this hypothesis.
Regarding pharmacokinetic properties of β-blockers, we
hypothesized that users of β-blockers that are subjected to
2D6 enzyme metabolism who carry a CYP2D6*4 variant are
at
increased
risk
for
fall
incidents,
due
to
decreased
metabolism and potentially increased drug concentrations.
Previous
studies
indicated
that
the
combination
of
metoprolol – a β-blocker predominantly metabolized by
CYP2D6 – use and a poor metabolizer phenotype – based on
genotype – was associated with a lower clearance, longer
half-life [49], and with lower blood pressure and heart rate
[17, 18]. Although we were not able to investigate these
specific endpoints, our results do not indicate that these
clinical effects – whether they occurred or not – were
translated into fall risk.
Our study has strengths and limitations. Its strength is the
combination
of
two
large,
independent,
community-
dwelling study populations, and thereby the possibility to
investigate consistency of a potential signal (finding) across
the two studies. Our study also has limitations, as the
B-PROOF study participants were included according to their
homocysteine levels. However, we do not think that this
inclusion criterion would have interfered with a mechanism
underlying a potential association between β-blocker use
and falls. In the Rotterdam Study, fall incidents were
differently assessed than in B-PROOF, as serious fall incidents
were gathered, and falls not leading to serious consequences
were not included. This may lead to a different association if
the underlying mechanism for β-blocker-related falls would
differ between serious and less serious falls. However, we are
not aware of different mechanisms, and the effect sizes were
relatively
similar
across
both
studies.
In
addition,
we
investigated current use. Possibly, participants encountering
side effects had already stopped using, switched to another
β-blocker or received lower doses. This may have resulted in
underestimation of the association. Another limitation is
the relatively low number of users carrying a CYP2D6*4
allele, consequently we clustered intermediate metabolizer
phenotype (carriers of one *4 allele) with poor metabolizers
(carriers of two *4 alleles). Despite the clustering, the
numbers were too low to draw conclusion. Lastly, we do not
have information on actual plasma levels of the β-blockers.
Conclusion
Our study indicates an increased fall risk in older people
during the use of nonselective β-blockers, contrary to
selective β-blockers. In clinical practice, β-blockers have been
shown effective for a variety of cardiovascular indications.
However, fall risk should be considered when prescribing a
β-blocker in this age group, and the pros and cons for
β-blockers classes should be taken into consideration.
