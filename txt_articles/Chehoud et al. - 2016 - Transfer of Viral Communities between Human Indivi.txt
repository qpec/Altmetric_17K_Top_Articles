ABSTRACT
Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective treatment for refractory Clostridium difficile infections.
However, concerns persist about unwanted cotransfer of pathogenic microbes such as viruses. Here we studed FMT from a sin-
gle healthy human donor to three pediatric ulcerative colitis patients, each of whom received a course of 22 to 30 FMT treat-
ments. Viral particles were purified from donor and recipient stool samples and sequenced; the reads were then assembled into
contigs corresponding to viral genomes or partial genomes. Transfer of selected viruses was confirmed by quantitative PCR. Vi-
ral contigs present in the donor could be readily detected in recipients, with up to 32 different donor viral contigs appearing in a
recipient sample. Reassuringly, none of these were viruses are known to replicate on human cells. Instead, viral contigs either
scored as bacteriophage or could not be attributed taxonomically, suggestive of unstudied phage. The two most frequently trans-
ferred gene types were associated with temperate-phage replication. In addition, members of Siphoviridae, the group of typically
temperate phages that includes phage lambda, were found to be transferred with significantly greater efficiency than other
groups. On the basis of these findings, we propose that the temperate-phage replication style may promote efficient phage trans-
fer between human individuals. In summary, we documented transfer of multiple viral lineages between human individuals
through FMT, but in this case series, none were from viral groups known to infect human cells.
IMPORTANCE
Transfer of whole communities of viruses between humans has rarely been studied but is of likely medical impor-
tance. Here we studied fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), a highly successful treatment for relapsing Clostridium difficile
infection and, potentially, other gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. We investigated the transfer of viral communities during FMT
and documented transfer of multiple viral lineages between humans. None of these were viruses that replicated on animal cells
or that are known to be pathogenic. We found that temperate bacteriophage, which form stable associations with their hosts,
were significantly more likely to be transferred during FMT. This supports a model in which the viral temperate replication style
may have evolved in part to support efficient viral transmission between environments.

F
ecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been used to treat
relapsing Clostridium difficile infection with great success and
shows promise for treatment of other indications (1, 2). However,
many pathogenic human viruses are known to be transmitted via
the fecal-oral route, and viral transfer accompanying FMT has not
been studied previously. Here we investigated viral transfer during
FMT using model-independent metagenomic sequencing.
Introduction of single viruses into humans has been closely
studied, but the transfer of populations of viruses is much less well
understood. Multiple viruses are commonly found as coinfections
in humans, though it is usually unknown whether acquisition of
these viruses was sequential or simultaneous. Careful tracking of
transmitted founder viruses during human immunodeficiency vi-
rus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission has revealed
examples of probable simultaneous transfer of multiple lineages
(3, 4). HIV and HCV commonly co-occur and may be acquired
simultaneously during intravenous drug use (5). In the case of
satellite viruses (e.g., hepatitis B virus and its satellite virus hepa-
titis D virus), the two are inferred to commonly infect together
because the satellite depends on its helper for replication (6). Mul-
tiple viruses that replicate in human cells may be transferred to-
gether during organ transplantation (7). For bacterial viruses, si-
multaneous acquisition of multiple lineages has rarely been
investigated.
The human fecal virome is immense in the numbers of viruses
present—comparable to the number of bacteria, which is 1011 per
g of feces—and the number of different types. Gut bacteriophages
are so numerous and diverse that sequence databases contain only

 a small fraction of the global population (8–14). Thus, simply
sequencing total DNA from stool and aligning to database ge-
nomes generally misses most of the bacteriophage sequences pres-
ent, necessitating specialized methods.
In this study, we investigated the transfer of viral communities
between humans through FMT and characterized features associ-
ated with particularly efficient transmission. We took advantage
of a case series where feces samples from a single donor were used
to treat three children with ulcerative colitis (UC) (15). These
subjects received a particularly intensive procedure, which con-
sisted of 22 to 30 FMT treatments per subject delivered by colono-
scopy or enema during a 6 to 12 week period. We performed
metagenomic analysis of viral particle fractions purified from fecal
samples from the donor, the donor product, and recipients before,
during, and after transplantation. To track viral transfer, we as-
sembled contigs representing viral genomes and monitored their
abundances through the transplantation process. All recipients
were detectably colonized by multiple donor viruses, document-
ing transfer of whole viral populations.
RESULTS
Subjects studied. Three pediatric UC patients receiving immuno-
therapy regimens were switched to receiving a course of 22 to 30
FMT treatments via colonoscopy or enema during a 6 to 12 week
period (Fig. 1A) (15). Donor stool specimens were from a single,
healthy, 37-year-old male. FMT in all three patients was associated
with a symptom-free period of at least 4 weeks, supporting the
temporary withdrawal of immunotherapy (no treatment other
than mesalamine). Treatment was associated with endoscopic and
histologic remission for at least 2 weeks after the last FMT. All
three subjects eventually relapsed and resumed therapy with im-
munomodulators.
Analysis of transfer of bacterial lineages. Bacterial microbiota
composition was investigated by purifying DNA from stool and
FIG 1 Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to treat ulcerative colitis. (A) Diagram of the treatment regimens. Patient 1 received 30 rounds of FMT, patient
2 received 25, and patient 3 received 22. All patients were in remission (gray-shaded boxes) while receiving the FMT course and remained in remission for more
than 11 weeks following their last FMT. However, all three eventually experienced a relapse requiring immunotherapy. Administration of mesalamine, given
orally or through a rectal enema, was allowed during the trial, depending on the clinical disease activity. Three samples (indicated as triangles) were taken from
each patient: one before the beginning of the FMT course (pre), the second after the 13th FMT (during), and the third 2 to 3 weeks after finishing the FMT course
(post). (B) Bacterial lineages in the samples studied. Bacterial taxonomic representation and abundance were characterized by sequencing of 16S rRNA gene tags.
Details are described in reference 15. (C) Viral families detected in the samples studied, assessed by alignment of reads to a curated database of viral sequences

the CDD. The output was interpreted using custom annotation relating Pfam domains to viral gene functions. Gene types identified are summarized at the right
in the figure. The percentages of classified phage ORFs from the four donor samples, patient 1, patient 2, and patient 3 were 8.9%, 7.1%, 3.8%, and 9.5%,
respectively.

 sequencing a segment of the 16S rRNA gene as previously de-
scribed (15). The donor samples contained high levels of Bacte-
roides and lower levels of Firmicutes such as Dialister and Subdoli-
granulum. Prior to FMT, the three recipients harbored communities
dominated by Subdoligranulum, Prevotella, and Bacteroides, respec-
tively. During FMT, Bacteroides dominated in all three recipients
(Fig. 1B). After completion of the FMT treatment, Bacteroides per-
sisted, but Firmicutes lineages also increased in abundance in recipi-
ents 2 and 3. Global community analysis showed that for all three
recipients, the composition of microbial communities during FMT
became detectably (though modestly) closer to that of the donor.
After FMT, all three recipients’ microbial communities increased in
diversity (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material), suggestive of ac-
quisition of healthier microbiota.
Compositionofthefecalviromeindonorsandrecipients.To
study viral transfer, virus-like particles (VLPs) were purified from
18 samples. We compared four donor samples of two types: two
were crude stool samples, and the other two were processed to
generate the liquid product used for FMT. Recipient samples were
taken prior to FMT, during the FMT intervention (after the 13th
FMT treatment), and after the FMT was completed. The five con-
trol samples were (i) a stool sample from a healthy 25-year-old
male, (ii) two stool samples from pediatric Crohn’s disease pa-
tients on immunotherapy but not receiving FMT, and (iii) two
buffer-only negative-control samples. The first three control sam-
ples were from well-studied subjects and served as positive con-
trols. The two pediatric Crohn’s disease patients were selected
because a previous metagenomic study had shown them to harbor
anelloviruses (Torque teno virus) and parvoviruses (Human bo-
cavirus) (16). The two buffer controls were included to document
contamination from reagents and environmental admixture.
VLPs were purified from the 18 samples, and then DNA was
isolated from the particles. VLP DNA was amplified using
multiple-displacement amplification (MDA) and the product se-
quenced using Illumina technology. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) for
16S was used to assay contaminating bacterial DNA, documenting
only low-level carryover (see Table S1 in the supplemental mate-
rial). Here we investigated only DNA viruses. RNA viruses are less
abundant in stool than DNA viruses, and results of previous stud-
ies performed by us and others suggest that many of the RNA
viruses present in stool are transient plant RNA viruses derived
from food (17; unpublished data).
At least one million reads were acquired from each fecal sample
(see Table S2 in the supplemental material), allowing detailed in-
vestigation of the viral populations. Low-quality reads were fil-
tered out, as were reads mapping to the human genome (hg18)
and phage phiX174 (the latter is added to sequencing mixtures for
technical reasons). Reads were aligned to a curated viral database
(18) using a permissive alignment threshold (BLAST E value
10�3). Low-abundance negative-control samples (�50,000 reads)
were filtered out, and plots of the proportions of the most abun-
dant taxa are shown (Fig. 1C). The majority of reads did not align
to reference database sequences (an average of 17.9% of reads
returned significant matches).
Of the reads that did align, the most common assignments
represented Microviridae, which are nonenveloped, single-
stranded DNA phages from the family that includes phiX174, and
caudovirales, the members of which comprise a broad family, in-
cluding all of the tailed phages. Of the two controls with known
animal cell viruses, anelloviruses were recovered efficiently and
bocavirus less efficiently. The MDA step is known to amplify
single-stranded circular DNA particularly efficiently, likely ex-
plaining the abundance of anelloviruses and Microviridae, both of
which have small single-stranded circular DNA genomes.
To examine the VLP genomes in our samples more fully, reads
were assembled into contigs using deBruijn graph assembly (19)
and overlap consensus methods (20). A total of 3,634 contigs were
built from the four donor samples (see Table S3 in the supplemen-
tal material). Of these, 261 were greater than 3,000 bp in length
(mean length, 8,161 bp; maximum length, 65,335 bp). For the
recipients, totals of 486, 1,177, and 1,936 contigs were built from
each pre-FMT sample; among these, 38, 138, and 127 contigs were
greater than 3,000 bp in length (see Table S4). These contigs were
assessed for length, circularity, and number of open reading
frames (ORFs). Nine of the 261 contigs were circular, suggest-
ing that we had sequenced the entire viral genome (see Fig. S2).
With one exception, these clustered at specific lengths sugges-
tive of anelloviruses (~3,000 bp), Microviridae (~5,000 to
6,000 bp), and Siphoviridae (typically �30,000 bp). One circular
contig (8,662 bp) was annotated as Podoviridae (typically
�40,000 bp), suggesting that it may have assembled as a circle due
to the presence of a repeated sequence. Linear contigs are either
complete linear genomes or genome fragments.
Proteinsencodedinthegutvirome.Tocatalogthegenespres-
ent, open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted, conceptually
translated, and aligned to several protein databases (19, 21, 22),
including one composed of conserved protein domains (from the
Conserved Domains Database [CDD]) known to be associated
with viruses (12, 14). A total of 3,321 ORFs were predicted. Pro-
tein types found in the donor and in each recipient pre-FMT are
summarized in Fig. 1D. Only an average of 7.3% of proteins were
annotated, which emphasizes the size of the pool of uncharacter-
ized bacteriophage genes. Prominent CDD types were associated
with phage capsids, tails, portals, terminases, and other structural
components. Additional annotations, including bacteriocin, beta-
lactamase, reverse transcriptase, and restriction modification,
were associated with effector proteins.
Contigs of length �3,000 bp had on average 6 ORFs, allowing
us to use gene family membership to annotate the probable viral
family of origin. We found that each contig had on average two
ORFs matching a viral genome (BLAST E value 10�5). The major-
ity of classified VLP genomes belonged to tailed phages (caudovi-
rales), which include Siphoviridae, Myoviridae, and Podoviridae.
Microviridae were also prominent. In several cases, single ORFs
annotated as belonging to animal cell virus lineages (Poxviridae,
Adenoviridae, and Herpesviridae), but multiple other ORFs on the
same contig annotated as caudovirales, so in these cases the cau-
dovirales attribution was retained, or multiple other ORFs were
unclassified, weakening the animal cell virus assignment. The two
Crohn’s disease samples preselected for containing animal cell
viruses returned contigs representing anellovirus and bocavirus as
expected.
Transfer of viral lineages with FMT. We then used the contigs
of �3,000 bp to investigate the transfer of phages during FMT
(Fig. 2; see also Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). To score
detection of a donor contig in a recipient, we required �50%
coverage of the contig and alignment of at least 5 paired reads,
where both reads in each pair showed high-quality alignment to
the target contig. We note that these criteria are conservative, so
the proposed numbers of contigs transferred represent minimal

 estimates. Comparing to recipient samples at the first time point
after initiation of FMT, while FMT was ongoing, we detected 21,
42, and 16 donor contigs, respectively. At the second time point, 5
to 13 weeks later, and 2 to 4 weeks after the completion of the FMT
treatment, we detected 5, 7, and 34 donor viral contigs, respec-
tively. Fig. S4 shows examples of sequence alignments of reads
from recipients at time points following transfer onto contigs built
from donor reads, illustrating high coverage.
To confirm the transfer from the donor to recipients, we used
quantitative PCR (qPCR) to analyze VLP DNA samples (Fig. 3).
As the template, we analyzed fecal VLP DNA specimens that were
not subjected to MDA amplification, which is known to distort
relative abundances. To confirm that some lineages transferred
efficiently, we analyzed four VLP contigs from the donor that were
detected in at least two different recipients. qPCR assays were
designed for each of the four contigs (see Table S5 in the supple-
mental material), and positive-control DNAs were synthesized for
use as copy number standards. We compared results from the four
donor samples to those from the nine recipient samples (three
patients, three time points each). We also tested the same positive
controls used in the viral sequencing analysis, specifically, stool
VLP DNA from a healthy 25-year-old male and from two pediatric
Crohn’s disease patients. As a negative control, we used a com-
mercial phage lambda DNA sample.
All four qPCR assays detected the expected contigs in the do-
nor samples and in at least two recipients. Levels were low in all
controls. For contig 100-94 (annotating as Microviridae) and con-
tig 100-182 (unattributed), donor contigs were detected after
FMT in all three recipients (Fig. 3A and B). For contigs 100-21
(Podoviridae) and 19 (Myoviridae), transfer was robust to subjects
2 and 3 (Fig. 3C and D). The maximum copy numbers detected
were in the range of 8 � 103 to 15 � 103 copies per nanogram of
VLP DNA.

investigated features of viral contigs associated with efficient
transmission during stool transplantation. We first asked whether
any inferred phage-encoded proteins could be identified that cor-
related with efficient transmission. Figure 4A shows the top two
conserved domain families that correlated with frequency of
transmission (P values, �0.05; odds ratio, �4.2 times more likely
to be transferred). These transferred domains were found to be
associated with the temperate replication style, in which phages
form quiescent long-term associations with their bacterial hosts.
The highest-scoring family (pfam01051) is annotated as an “ini-
tiator replication protein.” The best-studied member of this group
is RepA protein of the temperate-phage P1. RepA initiates DNA
replication on the P1 genome, and related proteins also mediate
replication of herpesviruses. The second-highest-scoring family
(pfam14659) is a domain from the lambda integrase family of
integration proteins. Lambda integrase is well known to mediate
integration during prophage formation. Thus, the top two genes
associated with preferential transfer were indicative of the temper-
ate replication style.
We next asked whether any viral families were preferentially
transferred by comparing frequencies in the donor versus recipi-
ent VLP populations. We focused the analysis on our most accu-
rate detections, specifically, the donor viral pool consisting of con-
tigs of �3,000 bp. Comparison showed that Siphoviridae were
significantly more likely to be transferred (P � 0.0072 by the
Fisher exact test; Fig. 4B). We repeated these tests by looking at
Siphoviridae compared to all contigs and again found Siphoviridae
to be significantly more likely to be transferred (P � 0.0001 by the
Fisher exact test; Fig. 4C). Siphoviridae include phage lambda, 434,
and P22 and are known be rich in temperate phage that have the
capacity to integrate into the host cell genome (23).
To confirm transfer, we selected four contigs annotating as
Siphoviridae and called as transferred and designed qPCR assays to
verify transfer. VLP DNA samples (not subjected to MDA) were
tested, and contigs were detected in the donor and recipient as
expected from the sequencing data (Fig. 4D to G). In all four cases,
the transferred phage were detected in at least two of the three
recipients, indicating transfer to multiple individuals.
DISCUSSION
Here we report transfer of gut viral communities associated with
FMT. No viruses infecting human cells were detected in the do-

built from donor samples that are indicated by sequence data to be present in
patients after FMT treatment, but not in recipient pre-FMT samples, were
quantified by qPCR. VLP DNA from stool was tested without the use of
Genomifi amplification (to reduce distortions of abundance data). Abundance
was quantified from 4 samples from the donor (two whole stool and two
purified product prepared for FMT), from samples from the 3 recipient pa-
tients (at three time points each), and from samples from 3 control individuals.

 nor; thus, reassuringly, no transfer could be documented in recip-
ients. Numerous recipient VLP sequence reads showed high-
quality alignments to donor VLP contigs, suggesting transfer with
FMT. Many were annotated as containing genes known to be
phage encoded, supporting the inference that the VLP contigs
corresponded to phage. From 5 to 34 transferred contigs could be
detected in recipient samples. Simultaneous transfer of multiple
viruses has rarely been documented in humans but was readily
detected here, potentially associated with the large number of
FMT treatments (22 to 30 per subject). On the basis of these ob-
servations, we propose that transfer of bacteriophage populations
is a general characteristic of FMT.
An alternative interpretation for our data could be that viruses
were not transferred from donor to recipients but instead were
present in recipients at levels that were initially below the level of
detection. According to this view, viruses preexisting in the recip-
ient would have grown out after FMT, resulting in the spurious
appearance of transfer. We cannot completely rule out this possi-
bility, but several aspects of phage biology in the human gut sup-
port our interpretation. Bacteriophage populations in the intes-
tines of healthy humans are known to show extreme differences
among individuals (8–14). However, within an individual, popu-
lations show notable longitudinal stability, at least in healthy sub-
jects (8, 10, 11). As a result, most VLP genomes are likely recog-
nizable by their individual of origin. Thus, while it is possible that
some new examples of detection in recipients represent the out-
growth of preexisting viruses, or even de novo colonization, we
expect that most recipient sequences resembling donor VLPs were
genuinely derived from the donor stool product.
Our most unexpected finding was that lysogeny is associated
with efficient transfer by FMT. This was indicated first by the
preferential transfer of the Siphoviridae, the group that includes
phage lambda and is known to be rich in temperate phage. Anal-
ysis of genes associated with transfer also made this point
(Fig. 4A). The most strongly associated gene encoded the RepA
protein, important for replication of the temperate-phage P1, and

 the second most strongly associated gene encoded a domain of the
lambda integrase protein, important for prophage formation.
On the basis of our findings, we propose that the temperate-
phage replication style may have evolved in part to optimize phage
transmission between environments. If bacteriophage must pass
through hostile environments to reach locations favorable for rep-
lication, transportation as a prophage may promote dispersal.
Transmission of gut viruses between human hosts potentially in-
volves persistence outside the gut, likely representing a transmis-
sion barrier. Viruses transferred efficiently by the fecal-oral route
are rarely enveloped, suggesting that tough physical properties
may be needed to survive fecal-oral transmission. In feces, an en-
veloping membrane may be damaged by the detergent effects of
bile salts or by drying after shedding in feces. Respiratory viruses,
in contrast, are commonly spread on respiratory droplets and are
often enveloped. Integration of prophage DNA into the bacterial
genome may provide a protective vehicle supporting phage trans-
mission despite exposure to feces or other hostile environmental
pressures. Thus, we propose that the temperate-phage replication
style may in part have evolved to maximize survival during trans-
mission.
In summary, we presented a metagenomic survey of DNA vi-
ruses transferred during FMT. Numerous temperate phage were
found to be transferred, but no viruses were detected that corre-
sponded to pathogenic viruses that infect human cells. The mate-
rials and methods employed for preparing and introducing feces
into patients differ and may influence the likelihood of viral trans-
mission, so additional characterization of viral transfer can help
guide development of safest practices.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human subjects. Human subjects and methods used for FMT have been
previously described (15). Fresh stool specimens from the healthy adult
donor were divided into ~50-g aliquots. Sterile normal saline solution was
added prior to homogenization in a strainer bag with 500-�m pores
(Seward Laboratory Systems Inc., Port Saint Lucie, FL) using a Smasher
Laboratory Blender/Homogenizer (AES Chemunex Inc., Cranbury, NJ).
Both fresh stool samples and the homogenized stool preparations used for
the transplantation were analyzed here. Experiments were carried out
under a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of Baylor
College of Medicine (H-30591).
DNA purification and sequencing. Detailed methods are presented in
Text S1 in the supplemental material and summarized here. Phage parti-
cles were purified from stool samples by suspension in SM buffer and
filtration through a 0.22-�m-pore-size filter (EMD; Millipore). The fil-
trate was concentrated using a 100-kDa-molecular-mass Centricon Plus
70 cutoff filter (Millipore), resuspended in 40 ml SM buffer (50 mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 8 mM MgSO4, 0.002% gelatin), and
concentrated. The concentrate was treated with DNase I and RNase
(Roche) at 37°C for 30 min to eliminate nonencapsulated nucleic acids,
and then the enzymes were deactivated at 65°C for 15 min. Total phage
DNA was extracted from particles using a QIAamp DNA stool kit (Qia-
gen). Extracted phage DNA was amplified using an Illustra GenomiPhi V2
DNA amplification kit (GE Healthcare). Libraries were made using an
Illumina Nextera XT Samples Prep kit and quantified using a SYBR Fast
Illumina library quantification kit (Kapa Biosystems).
Purified VLP DNAs were sequenced on three MiSeq runs (250 bases
per read, paired-end sequencing) according to the instructions of the
manufacturer (Illumina). Two negative-control samples yielded 1,242
and 36,156 reads, respectively. Contigs were built from the four donor
samples and were annotated with open reading frames (ORFs), integrase
genes, and viral family names based on similarity to reference viral ge-
nomes. ORFs were also aligned to entries in a database of conserved do-
main integrase genes (to assess potential temperate replication style) and
also the Virulence Factor Database, Aclame database of mobile genetic
elements, NCBI’s reference viral database, NCBI’s reference bacterial da-
tabase, and NCBI’s nucleotide database to assess additional functional
features (summarized in Tables S3 and S4 in the supplemental material).
Reads from all of the samples were mapped to contigs built from the four
donor samples using Bowtie2 (24). Coverage metrics were calculated,
including the rate of concordance between paired reads, the average depth
of coverage, and the percentage of each contig that was covered by reads.
qPCR validation. The qPCR analysis for quantitating contigs was per-
formed using FastSYBR green master mix (Applied Biosystems). Primers
are described in Table S5 in the supplemental material. ZeroBlunt TOPO
vector (Thermo, Fisher Scientific), containing the corresponding
gBLOCK synthetic copy number control sequence, was linearized and
used as a standard control.
Quantification of 16S rRNA copy numbers was performed using the
real-time TaqMan method with TaqMan Environmental master mix 2.0
and primers as indicated in Table S5 in the supplemental material Zer-
oBlunt TOPO vector containing a nearly full-length clone of Escherichia
coli 16S was linearized and used as a standard control.
Statistical analysis. The Fisher exact test and odds ratios were used to
assess significance of conserved domains or viral family transfer.
Assessing contamination of phage DNA preparations with bacterial
and human DNA. Purities of the phage DNA preparations were assessed
using qPCR to quantify bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies (see Table S1 in
the supplemental material). Values ranged from 7 to 5,021 16S rRNA gene
copies/ng of purified phage DNA (average, 257 copies/ng). The contribu-
tion of bacterial DNA per nanogram of purified phage DNA could be
estimated by assuming that the average bacterial genome has 2 to 5 rRNA
gene copies and is 2.5 to 5.5 Mb (25) in total (molecular weight [MW],
1.6 � 109 to 3.3 � 109), implying that, on average, 1.0 nanograms of phage
DNA was contaminated with 1.1 pg of bacterial DNA.
Human DNA contamination was assayed by aligning sequence reads
from the VLP DNA samples to the human genome. Most samples con-
tained �1% human DNA; the highest value recorded was 4% (see Ta-
ble S2 in the supplemental material).
We thus concluded that bacterial DNA and human DNA were minor
contributors to the VLP genomic DNA samples studied.
