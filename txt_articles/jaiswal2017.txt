BACKGROUND
Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), which is defined as the 
presence of an expanded somatic blood-cell clone in persons without other hema-
tologic abnormalities, is common among older persons and is associated with an 
increased risk of hematologic cancer. We previously found preliminary evidence 
for an association between CHIP and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but 
the nature of this association was unclear.
METHODS
We used whole-exome sequencing to detect the presence of CHIP in peripheral-
blood cells and associated such presence with coronary heart disease using sam-
ples from four case–control studies that together enrolled 4726 participants with 
coronary heart disease and 3529 controls. To assess causality, we perturbed the 
function of Tet2, the second most commonly mutated gene linked to clonal hema-
topoiesis, in the hematopoietic cells of atherosclerosis-prone mice.
RESULTS
In nested case–control analyses from two prospective cohorts, carriers of CHIP 
had a risk of coronary heart disease that was 1.9 times as great as in noncarriers 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 2.7). In two retrospective case–control co-
horts for the evaluation of early-onset myocardial infarction, participants with 
CHIP had a risk of myocardial infarction that was 4.0 times as great as in noncar-
riers (95% CI, 2.4 to 6.7). Mutations in DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, and JAK2 were each 
individually associated with coronary heart disease. CHIP carriers with these 
mutations also had increased coronary-artery calcification, a marker of coronary 
atherosclerosis burden. Hypercholesterolemia-prone mice that were engrafted with 
bone marrow obtained from homozygous or heterozygous Tet2 knockout mice had 
larger atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic root and aorta than did mice that had 
received control bone marrow. Analyses of macrophages from Tet2 knockout mice 
showed elevated expression of several chemokine and cytokine genes that contrib-
ute to atherosclerosis.
CONCLUSIONS
The presence of CHIP in peripheral-blood cells was associated with nearly a dou-
bling in the risk of coronary heart disease in humans and with accelerated athero-
sclerosis in mice. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.)

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
A 
ging is associated with an in-
creased incidence of cancer and cardio-
vascular disease. We and others recently 
used whole-exome sequencing data to identify a 
common, age-related disorder marked by an 
expansion of hematopoietic clones carrying re-
current somatic mutations, most frequently loss-
of-function alleles in the genes DNMT3A, TET2, 
and ASXL1.1-3 These mutations, which are also 
common in the myelodysplastic syndrome and 
acute myeloid leukemia,4 provide a selective ad-
vantage to the hematopoietic stem cells in which 
they occur5,6 and are detectable as clones in pe-
ripheral-blood samples because the mutated stem 
cells maintain the ability to differentiate into 
circulating granulocytes, monocytes, and lym-
phocytes.7,8 Such clones rarely accumulate in per-
sons younger than 40 years of age, but they be-
come more common among older persons, with 
more than 10% of persons older than 70 years of 
age carrying such a mutation. Carriers of these 
mutations have 10 times the risk of a hemato-
logic cancer as do those without such mutations. 
On the basis of these findings, we provisionally 
defined persons carrying such mutations in the 
absence of any other hematologic abnormalities 
as having clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate 
potential (CHIP).9
Our exploratory analysis revealed that persons 
with CHIP are at increased risk for death from 
any cause and, surprisingly, for coronary heart 
disease.1 Although traditional risk factors for coro-
nary heart disease (e.g., hypercholesterolemia, type 
2 diabetes, hypertension, and smoking) account 
for a large proportion of the risk, many persons 
with atherosclerosis or coronary heart disease 
do not have established risk factors,10,11 which 
suggests that unknown factors may also contrib-
ute to atherosclerosis and its complications. In 
this study, we tested the hypothesis that CHIP 
contributes causally to atherosclerotic cardiovas-
cular disease.
Methods
Study Samples
The primary samples that we used were obtained 
from four case–control studies that together en-
rolled 4726 participants with coronary heart dis-
ease and 3529 controls. The protocols for all four 
of these studies were approved by the ethics com-
mittees at all involved institutions; written in-
formed consent was obtained from all the par-
ticipants.
First, we used a modified nested case–control 
study design from two prospective cohort stud-
ies, BioImage and Malmö Diet and Cancer 
(MDC). BioImage was selected because of the 
enrichment of the cohort with older participants 
at high cardiovascular risk,12 whereas MDC was 
selected because of its long follow-up period and 
extensive phenotypic data.13 After the exclusion 
of participants with prevalent cardiovascular 
events, coronary heart disease was defined as a 
history of myocardial infarction or coronary re-
vascularization after the time of DNA collection. 
Among these participants, we selected those 
with coronary heart disease who were matched 
with controls on the basis of age, sex, type 2 
diabetes status, and smoking history without 
regard to follow-up time. The baseline charac-
teristics of the participants in these two cohorts 
are shown in Table S1 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix, available with the full text of this article 
at NEJM.org.
We analyzed whole-exome sequencing data 
from two retrospective case–control studies, the 
Atherosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biolo-
gy Italian Study Group (ATVB)14 and the Pakistan 
Risk of Myocardial Infarction Study (PROMIS),15,16 
to evaluate participants with early-onset (age, 
<50 years) myocardial infarction. In these stud-
ies, case participants consisted of those with 
early-onset myocardial infarction who were se-
lected at the time of the index presentation to 
hospitals, and controls were persons from the 
same medical centers who did not have cardio-
vascular disease. In ATVB, case participants 
were 45 years of age or younger and were age-
matched with controls, whereas in PROMIS we 
selected only case participants and controls who 
were from 40 to 50 years of age. The baseline 
characteristics of the participants in these two 
cohorts are shown in Table S2 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix.
To understand which CHIP genes contributed 
to the risk of coronary heart disease, we per-
formed a gene-level analysis on samples ob-
tained from BioImage, MDC, and three prospec-
tive cohorts unselected for coronary events: the 
Jackson Heart Study (JHS), the Finland–United 
States Investigation of NIDDM [Non–Insulin-
Dependent Diabetes Mellitus] Genetics (FUSION), 
and the Framingham Heart Study (FHS).17 JHS

and FUSION were part of our prior association 
study of CHIP with coronary heart disease,1 
whereas samples from FHS were newly analyzed 
for this study.
Whole-Exome Sequencing
DNA was obtained from individual studies, and 
further processing was performed at the Broad 
Institute of Harvard and the Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology. We performed whole-exome 
sequencing on blood samples obtained from 113 
participants with coronary heart disease and 257 
controls from BioImage and on samples obtained 
from 320 participants with coronary heart dis-
ease and 320 controls from MDC. Whole-exome 
sequencing in ATVB and PROMIS had been per-
formed previously. We identified CHIP carriers 
on the basis of a prespecified list of variants in 
74 genes known to be recurrently mutated in 
myeloid cancers (Table S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Details regarding the sequencing pro-
cedures are provided in the Extended Methods 
section in the Supplementary Appendix.
Atherosclerosis in Mice
We transplanted atherosclerosis-prone mice that 
were bred to have a knockout mutation for the 
gene encoding low-density lipoprotein receptor 
(Ldlr) with bone marrow from Tet2 control mice 
or heterozygous or homozygous knockout mice. 
The mice were started on a high-fat, high-choles-
terol diet and then assessed for atherosclerosis at 
various time points. We performed gene-expres-
sion analysis on macrophages cultured from bone 
marrow obtained from Tet2 control or knockout 
mice that had been exposed to vehicle or low-
density lipoprotein (LDL).
Statistical Analysis
In the analysis of data from the BioImage and 
MDC studies, we used a Cox proportional-hazards 
model after adjustment for age, sex, type 2 dia-
betes status, total cholesterol, high-density lipo-
protein (HDL) cholesterol, hypertension, and 
smoking status. In the analysis of data from 
ATVB and PROMIS, we analyzed whole-exome 
sequencing data using a logistic-regression mod-
el after adjustment for age, sex, type 2 diabetes 
status, and smoking status. Details regarding 
the statistical analysis are provided in the Ex-
tended Methods section in the Supplementary 
Appendix.
Results
Association between CHIP and Coronary 
Heart Disease
In the samples obtained from the BioImage and 
MDC studies, we found that the somatic muta-
tions most commonly occurred in the genes 
DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 and that 72 of 77 
participants (94%) with CHIP had a mutation in 
only a single driver gene1,2 (Table S4 and Fig. S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
The median age of the participants in BioImage 
at the time of DNA sample collection was 70 years, 
and the median follow-up time was 2.6 years. We 
found that 19 of 113 participants with coronary 
heart disease (17%) were CHIP carriers versus 25 
of 257 controls (10%) (hazard ratio, 1.8; 95% con-
fidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 2.9; P 
= 
0.03). The me-
dian age of the participants in MDC was 60 years 
at the time of DNA sample collection, and the 
median follow-up was 17.7 years. CHIP was identi-
fied in 21 of 320 participants with coronary heart 
disease (7%) versus in 12 of 320 controls (4%) 
(hazard ratio, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.1; P 
= 
0.003) 
(Fig. 1A, and Table S5 and Fig. S2 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). The combined analysis of the 
two cohorts in a fixed-effects meta-analysis showed 
that the CHIP carriers had a risk of incident coro-
nary heart disease that was 1.9 times as great as 
in noncarriers (95% CI, 1.4 to 2.7; P<0.001).
Association between CHIP and Early-Onset 
Myocardial Infarction
In both ATVB and PROMIS, participants with 
early-onset myocardial infarction had marked 
enrichment of CHIP, as compared with controls. 
In ATVB, 37 of 1753 participants with myocardial 
infarction (2%) were CHIP carriers versus 6 of 
1583 controls (<1%) (odds ratio, 5.4; 95% CI, 2.3 
to 13.0; P<0.001). In PROMIS, 52 of 2540 partici-
pants with myocardial infarction (2%) were CHIP 
carriers versus 13 of 1369 controls (1%) (odds 
ratio, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.8 to 6.5; P<0.001). A com-
bined fixed-effects meta-analysis of these two 
cohorts showed that CHIP was associated with an 
odds ratio of 4.0 (95% CI, 2.4 to 6.7; P<0.001) for 
early-onset myocardial infarction (Fig. 1B).

nary events, we specifically tested for associa-
tions between coronary heart disease and muta-
tions in DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, and JAK2. 
Participants with mutations in DNMT3A, TET2, 
and ASXL1 had 1.7 to 2.0 times the risk of inci-
dent coronary heart disease as did those with no 
mutations, whereas the JAK2 V617F mutation 
was associated with 12.1 times the risk (Fig. 2A).
Mutations in TET2, JAK2, and ASXL1 also 
showed significant enrichment among partici-
pants with early-onset myocardial infarction in 
samples obtained from ATVB and PROMIS, with 
myocardial infarction identified in 12 of 13 par-
ticipants with TET2 mutations, in 8 of 8 partici-
pants with ASXL1 mutations, and in 16 of 16 
participants with JAK2 mutations (Fig. 2B). JAK2 
V617F accounted for 19% of the total mutations 
among patients with myocardial infarction in 
ATVB and PROMIS but for only 4% in BioImage 
and MDC (Fig. 2C).
Association between CHIP and Coronary-
Artery Calcification
We hypothesized that an increased atherosclero-
sis burden drives the association between CHIP 
and coronary heart disease, rather than other

age, sex, type 2 diabetes status, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, smoking status, and 
hypertension. Panel B shows a forest plot of odds ratios for the association between myocardial infarction and

after adjustment for age, sex, type 2 diabetes status, and smoking status.

Panel A shows a forest plot of hazard ratios for the risk of coronary heart disease in BioImage, MDC, and three prospective cohorts that were unselected for coronary events: the 
Jackson Heart Study (JHS), Finland–United States Investigation of NIDDM [Non–Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus] Genetics (FUSION), and the Framingham Heart Study 
(FHS), according to mutated gene. Hazard ratios for the listed mutations were obtained by a fixed-effects meta-analysis of Cox proportional-hazards models after adjustment for

among the participants in ATVB and PROMIS (combined analysis), according to the mutated gene. The odds ratios for myocardial infarction were obtained with the use of Fisher’s 
exact test; P values were not adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing. Panel C shows the proportion of total mutations (according to gene) among participants with myocardial in-
farction in the ATVB and PROMIS studies, as compared with those with coronary heart disease in the BioImage and MDC studies.

factors that might cause myocardial infarction, 
such as increased thrombosis or vasospasm. 
Among the participants in the BioImage study, we 
assessed data on coronary-artery calcification, a 
noninvasive measure of atherosclerosis as detect-
ed on cardiac computed tomography. Among those 
without incident coronary heart disease, CHIP 
carriers had a median score for coronary-artery 
calcification that was 3.3 times as high as that 
in noncarriers (306 versus 92 Agatston units); in 
those with incident coronary heart disease, the 
score was 1.8 times as high in CHIP carriers as 
in noncarriers (650 versus 355 Agatston units) 
(P 
= 
0.03 by linear regression after adjustment for 
incident coronary heart disease) (Fig. 3A).
A coronary-artery calcification score of 615 
Agatston units or more has served as an empiri-
cal cutoff for identifying older persons at high 
risk for coronary events.18 Among the participants 
without incident coronary heart disease, CHIP 
carriers were 3.0 times as likely to have a coro-
nary-artery calcification score of 615 or more 
than were noncarriers (P 
= 
0.05 by logistic regres-
sion after adjustment for age, sex, type 2 diabetes 
status, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, hyper-
tension, and smoking status) (Fig. 3B).
We had previously found that the presence of 
a CHIP clone with a variant allele fraction of at 
least 10% (which corresponds to ≥20% of nucle-
ated blood cells harboring the mutation) was 
associated with a greater risk of a hematologic 
cancer than a CHIP clone below this size.1 
Therefore, we tested whether CHIP with a larger 
clone size was also associated with a greater 
burden of atherosclerosis. CHIP carriers without 
incident coronary heart disease but with a vari-
ant allele fraction of a least 10% had 12 times 
the risk of having a coronary-artery calcification 
score of 615 or more as did noncarriers (P 
= 
0.002 
by logistic regression after adjustment), whereas 
participants with a variant allele fraction of less 
than 10% had no increased risk (P 
= 
0.02 for 
heterogeneity) (Fig. 3B, and Fig. S3 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix).
We hypothesized that the participants with 
an increased proportion of mutated cells might 
also have a greater risk of incident coronary heart 
disease. In a meta-analysis of data from BioIm-
age and the three prospective cohorts unselected 
for coronary events, we found that the risk of 
incident coronary heart disease was 2.2 times as 
great among the participants with a variant al-
lele fraction of at least 10% as among those 
without mutations (P<0.001 by Cox proportional 
hazards after adjustment), whereas those with a 
variant allele fraction of less than 10% had a risk 
that was 1.4 times as great (P 
= 
0.16; P 
= 
0.24 for 
heterogeneity) (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). In this analysis, data from MDC were

Calcification.
Panel A shows coronary-artery calcification (CAC) scores in Agatston units 
among participants with CHIP and those without CHIP in the BioImage 
study, stratified according to the presence or absence of incident coronary 
heart disease. The horizontal line in each box indicates the median score, 
and the top and bottom of the boxes indicate the 75th and 25th percen-
tiles, respectively. Among the participants with no coronary heart disease, 
the median scores were 92 for no CHIP and 306 for CHIP; among those 
with coronary heart disease, the median scores were 355 and 650, respec-
tively. P = 0.03 for the comparison between CHIP and no CHIP; the P value 
was obtained with the use of a linear-regression model of logarithm-trans-
formed CAC plus 1, after adjustment for incident coronary heart disease 
status. Panel B shows a forest plot of odds ratios for the association be-
tween a CAC score of 615 or more and mutation status, stratified accord-
ing to the variant allele fraction (VAF) among participants with incident 
coronary heart disease in BioImage. The odds ratios were obtained with 
the use of a logistic-regression model after adjustment for age, sex, type 2 
diabetes status, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, smoking status, and hy-
pertension. P = 0.02 for heterogeneity between a VAF of less than 0.10 and 
a VAF of 0.10 or more.

and coronary heart disease, we next sought to 
assess causality experimentally. We selected Tet2 
for further study because it is the second most 
commonly mutated gene in CHIP and has been 
associated with the risk of coronary heart disease 
regardless of age. In previous studies, hematopoi-
etic stem cells from mice that are homozygous for 
loss of function of Tet2 in all hematopoietic cells 
recapitulate the clonal advantage of mutated TET2 
hematopoietic cells seen in humans.6
We transplanted bone marrow from these mice 
and from control mice into irradiated, athero-
sclerosis-prone Ldlr knockout mice19 and initiat-
ed a high-cholesterol diet after allowing time for 
hematopoietic reconstitution. As compared with 
mice that had received control bone marrow, 
mice that had received bone marrow from the 
Tet2 knockout mice had a median lesion size in 
the aortic root that was 2.0 times as large after 
5 weeks (P 
= 
0.02 by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test), 
that was 1.7 times as large after 9 weeks (P 
= 
0.01 
by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test), and that was 1.4 
times as large after 13 weeks (P 
= 
0.03 by Dunn’s 
test) (Fig. 4A and 4B, and Fig. S5A and S5B in 
the Supplementary Appendix). By 17 weeks, the 
median lesion size in the descending aorta was 
2.7 times as large in the mice that had received 
bone marrow from Tet2 knockout mice as in 
those that had received control bone marrow 
(P 
= 
0.02 by Dunn’s test) (Fig. 4C and 4D).
Most humans with TET2-associated CHIP have 
a mutation in only a single allele of the gene.1,2 
Therefore, we also tested the phenotype of Tet2 
haploinsufficiency. Ldlr knockout mice receiving 
bone marrow from mice that were heterozygous 
for the Tet2 deletion had a median aortic-root 
lesion size that was 1.4 times as large as that in 
control mice after 13 weeks on the high-choles-
terol diet (P 
= 
0.05 by Dunn’s test) (Fig. S5A and 
S5B in the Supplementary Appendix); after 17 
weeks, the median lesion size in the descending 
aorta was 2.7 times as large (P 
= 
0.03 by Dunn’s 
test) (Fig. 4C and 4D).
Mice receiving bone marrow from Tet2 knock-
out mice had normal levels of peripheral-blood 
white cells and a normal differential count dur-
ing the study period. There also was no signifi-
cant between-group difference in fasting serum 
lipid levels after 17 weeks on the high-cholesterol 
diet (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Loss of Tet2 Function in Myeloid Cells
The earliest stages of atherosclerosis involve 
monocyte infiltration into vessel walls and dif-
ferentiation into macrophages.20 We hypothe-
sized that Tet2 loss alters the function of macro-
phages (and their precursor monocytes) in plaques 
to enhance atherosclerosis. We tested this hy-
pothesis by generating mice that lacked Tet2 in 
the majority of myeloid cells but not in other 
lineages; to create this murine line, we bred 
mice with loxP sites flanking exon 3 of Tet2 with 
mice that express Cre recombinase from the Lyz2 
promoter.21 In Ldlr knockout mice that had re-
ceived bone marrow from these mice, the mean 
size of the aortic-root lesion was 1.7 times as 
large as in mice that had received control bone 
marrow after 10 weeks on the high-cholesterol 
diet (P 
= 
0.003 by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test) 
(Fig. S5C in the Supplementary Appendix).
Tet2 catalyzes DNA hydroxymethylation,22 an 
epigenetic modification that can influence gene 
transcription. Therefore, we hypothesized that 
Tet2 modulated gene expression in macrophages 
exposed to excess cholesterol. We cultured bone 
marrow–derived macrophages from Tet2 knock-
out or control mice, incubated them with either 
vehicle or a pathophysiologically relevant dose of 
native LDL (200 mg per deciliter),23,24 and ana-
lyzed the transcriptome using messenger RNA 
sequencing. Gene set enrichment analysis re-
vealed that the most significantly up-regulated 
functional class of genes in Tet2 knockout mac-
rophages contained cytokines or chemokines and 
receptors, whereas the most significantly sup-
pressed class contained genes involved in lyso-
somal function. Gene class annotations were ob-
tained from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG) database (Tables S7 and S8 and 
Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
We focused on the set of 217 genes that showed 
differential regulation by both loss of Tet2 and by 
LDL treatment. Transcript levels in Cxcl1, Cxcl2, 
Cxcl3, Pf4, Il1b, and Il6 were among the most 
highly induced in Tet2 knockout macrophages in 
this set (Fig. S7A and S7B in the Supplementary

Appendix). Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Cxcl3, and Pf4 belong to 
a single C-X-C motif (CXC) chemokine gene clus-
ter, whereas Il1b and Il6 are classic proinflam-
matory cytokine genes. Tet2 knockout macro-
phages also secreted more of these proteins in 
vitro in response to LDL loading or endotoxin 
exposure than did control macrophages. Al-
though either LDL or endotoxin strongly induced 
the CXC chemokines, endotoxin but not LDL 
caused robust secretion of interleukin-1b and 
interleukin-6 (Fig. S7C in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
To assess the in vivo importance of these 
observations, we measured CXC chemokine lev-
els in the transplanted mice after they had been 
on an atherogenic diet for 13 to 17 weeks. We 
found that the levels of Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Cxcl3, Pf4, 
and Ppbp were 2 to 4 times as high in the serum 
of mice that had received bone marrow from 
Tet2 knockout mice as in mice that had received

Shown are the effects of the transplantation of bone marrow into female, atherosclerosis-prone Ldlr knockout mice, 
according to whether the donor mice had wild-type (WT) Tet2, heterozygous (HET) Tet2, or knockout (KO) Tet2. 
Deletions in Tet2 were obtained by using Cre recombinase expressed from the Vav1 promoter. Panel A shows aortic-
root sections obtained from mice that had received transplants from WT or KO Tet2 mice after the mice had re-
ceived a high-cholesterol diet for 5 weeks and 9 weeks (oil red O staining at 5 weeks and Masson’s trichrome stain-
ing at 9 weeks). The dashed lines indicate the lesion areas. Panel B shows the quantification of aortic-root lesions in 
mice that had received transplants from WT or KO Tet2 mice at 5 weeks and 9 weeks. P values were obtained with 
the use of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Panel C shows lesions in the descending aorta that were stained with oil red 
O at 17 weeks in mice that had received transplants from WT, HET, or KO Tet2 mice. The amount of red dye that is 
visible indicates the degree of atherosclerosis, according to Tet2 status. Panel D shows the quantification of lesions 
in the descending aorta at 17 weeks, according to Tet2 status. P values were obtained with the use of Dunn’s Krus-
kal–Wallis test for multiple comparisons and the Benjamini–Hochberg correction. In Panels B and D, the black hori-
zontal lines represent the median values.

Clonal Hematopoiesis and Risk of Atherosclerosis
control bone marrow, whereas those that had 
received bone marrow from mice that were het-
erozygous for Tet2 deletion showed intermediate 
levels (Fig. S7D in the Supplementary Appendix).
We also sought evidence of increased inflam-
mation in other tissues. In mice that had received 
Tet2 knockout bone marrow, there was develop-
ment of prominent xanthomas in the spleen and 
middle ear, marked foam-cell accumulation and 
glomerulosclerosis in the kidney, and large in-
flammatory infiltrates in the liver and lung (Fig. 
S8A and S8B in the Supplementary Appendix).
Because we found increased levels of CXC 
chemokines in the serum of mice that had re-
ceived bone marrow from Tet2 knockout mice, we 
tested for an analogous increase in humans with 
TET2 clonal hematopoiesis. The prototypical CXC 
chemokine in humans is interleukin-8, which 
mice lack. Plasma levels of interleukin-8 were 
available from 2689 controls (age range, 40 to 82 
years) in the PROMIS study. The 12 participants 
with TET2 mutations in this cohort had signifi-
cantly higher circulating interleukin-8 levels than 
did those without the mutations (median level, 
50 vs. 21 ng per milliliter; P 
= 
0.02 by the Wil-
coxon rank-sum test on log-transformed values) 
(Fig. S8C in the Supplementary Appendix).
Discussion
In four distinct studies involving human partici-
pants, we found that somatic mutations leading 
to CHIP had significant associations with the risk 
of coronary heart disease or early-onset myocar-
dial infarction. In a murine model of atheroscle-
rosis, the loss of Tet2 function in hematopoietic 
cells accelerated atherogenesis.
These results support several conclusions. First, 
the relationship between CHIP and coronary heart 
disease appears to be a causal one. Experimental 
manipulation of one of the genes that is most 
frequently mutated in CHIP — Tet2 — worsened 
atherosclerosis in mice. In humans, coronary 
events increased in relation to clone size, and 
there was also a dose–response relationship be-
tween clone size and atherosclerosis on imaging.
Second, mutations in multiple CHIP-associat-
ed genes were linked to coronary heart disease. 
We suggest that these mutations may increase the 
risk of coronary events owing to altered transcrip-
tional output of macrophages. These cells medi-
ate many inflammatory responses and promi-
nently populate atherosclerotic plaques.25,26 In 
support of this model, we found that loss of Tet2 
augmented the expression of inflammatory che-
mokines in macrophages that were exposed to 
native LDL, an effect that is similar to that in 
Tet2-deficient macrophages that were exposed to 
bacterial endotoxin.27
Previous studies have shown that CXC che-
mokine interaction with the receptor CXCR2 can 
mediate firm monocyte adhesion to inflamed 
endothelium28,29 and that this interaction pro-
motes atherogenesis.30,31 We propose that a major 
consequence of TET2 deficiency in tissue macro-
phages is the enhanced recruitment of monocytes 
and other blood cells to peripheral sites, including 
the arterial intima, because of elevated expression 
of CXC chemokines. Several organs of mice lack-
ing hematopoietic Tet2 harbored large leukocyte 
aggregates, and TET2 mutations in humans were 
associated with increased plasma levels of inter-
leukin-8. A recent study also identified augment-
ed Il1b and inflammasome activation as a major 
mediator of atherosclerosis in mice with hemato-
poietic Tet2 deficiency.32 It is unclear which par-
ticular inflammatory mediators predominate in 
driving atherosclerosis associated with TET2 de-
ficiency and whether mutations in DNMT3A, ASXL1, 
and JAK2 also influence the risk of coronary events 
by means of increased inflammation, issues that 
invite further experimentation.
An alternative explanation for the observed 
association is that CHIP-associated mutations 
provide a proliferative advantage to hematopoietic 
progenitors and a consequent increase in circulat-
ing myeloid cells. Elevations in levels of peripher-
al-blood granulocytes and monocytes have been 
linked to coronary outcomes in the general popu-
lation,33 whereas persons with JAK2-mutated my-
eloproliferative neoplasms are at increased risk for 
venous and coronary thrombosis, according to the 
degree of leukocytosis.34,35 However, nearly all 
persons with clonal hematopoiesis caused by mu-
tations in DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 have a nor-
mal white-cell count and differential,1,36 and JAK2 
mutations account for only a small percentage of 
CHIP. Furthermore, mice that lacked hematopoi-
etic Tet2 had normal blood counts in our study 
and in previous studies.32,37 Nonetheless, we can-
not fully rule out a role for leukocytosis in human 
coronary heart disease, since CHIP could lead to 
a myeloproliferative state over several years.
In conclusion, our data support the hypothe-

sis that somatic mutations in hematopoietic cells 
contribute to the development of human athero-
sclerosis. We propose that clonal hematopoiesis 
may be a modifiable risk factor, perhaps through 
the use of cholesterol-lowering medications or 
targeting of specific inflammatory pathways.
