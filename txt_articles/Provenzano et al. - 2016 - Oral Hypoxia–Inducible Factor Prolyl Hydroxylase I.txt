Abstract
Background and objectives Roxadustat (FG-4592), an oral hypoxia–inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor
that stimulates erythropoiesis, regulates iron metabolism, and reduces hepcidin, was evaluated in this phase 2b
study for safety, efficacy, optimal dose, and dose frequency in patients with nondialysis CKD.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements The 145 patients with nondialysis CKD and hemoglobin #10.5 g/dl
were randomized into one of six cohorts of approximately 24 patients each with varying roxadustat starting doses
(tiered weight and fixed amounts) and frequencies (two and three times weekly) followed by hemoglobin
maintenance with roxadustat one to three times weekly. Treatment duration was 16 or 24 weeks. Intravenous iron
was prohibited. The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving hemoglobin increase of $1.0 g/dl
from baseline and hemoglobin of $11.0 g/dl by week 17 (16 weeks of treatment). Secondary analyses included
mean hemoglobin change from baseline, iron utilization, and serum lipids. Safety was evaluated by frequency/
severity of adverse events.
Results Of the 145 patients enrolled, 143 were evaluable for efficacy. Overall, 92% of patients achieved
hemoglobin response. Higher compared with lower starting doses led to earlier achievement of hemoglobin
response. Roxadustat–induced hemoglobin increases were independent of baseline C–reactive protein levels and
iron repletion status. Overall, over the first 16 treatment weeks, hepcidin levels decreased by 16.9% (P=0.004),
reticulocyte hemoglobin content was maintained, and hemoglobin increased by a mean (6SD) of 1.83 (60.09)
g/dl (P,0.001). Overall mean total cholesterol level was reduced by a mean (6SD) of 26 (630) mg/dl (P,0.001)
after 8 weeks of therapy, independent of the use of statins or other lipid–lowering agents. No drug–related serious
adverse events were reported.
Conclusions In patients with nondialysis CKD who were anemic, various starting dose regimens of roxadustat
were well tolerated and achieved anemia correction with reduced serum hepcidin levels. After anemia
correction, hemoglobin was maintained by roxadustat at various dose frequencies without intravenous iron
supplementation.

Introduction
Anemia is a common CKD complication associated
with increased morbidity and mortality (1,2). Re-
combinant erythropoiesis–stimulating agents (ESAs)
provide improved quality of life in dialysis (1,3–5)
and nondialysis (6–8) populations and reduce red
blood cell (RBC) transfusions. However, anemia in a
majority of patients with nondialysis CKD (NDD-
CKD) stages 3b–5a is not treated and often delayed
because of late nephrology referral and ESA reim-
bursement limitations (9). Between 2005 and 2010,
only 28% of patients with CKD in the United States
received ESA before dialysis initiation (10).
Additionally, safety of ESAs in CKD anemia treat-
ment is being questioned after greater risks for death,
cardiovascular events, and stroke were observed in
ESA intervention trials targeting hemoglobin (Hb)
.13 g/dl (11–13). Consequently, ESA use, even in
patients with Hb,10 g/dl, decreased markedly after
2011 following US Food and Drug Administration
warnings to reduce ESA utilization to transfusion
avoidance only (14).
These developments may adversely affect outcomes
in patients with CKD and Hb,10 g/dl who have
higher risks of hospitalization, RBC transfusion (15),
progression to dialysis, and mortality (16,17). Specif-
ically, RBC transfusions may allosensitize patients
with CKD, reducing likelihood to receive a transplant
(18–20). These potential consequences of untreated/
undertreated anemia coupled with ESA safety

 concerns call for safer, effective, and accessible treatment
for CKD anemia (21).
Roxadustat (FG-4592) is a hypoxia–inducible factor prolyl
hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF-PHI). Transient inhibition of
prolyl hydroxylase by hypoxia or HIF-PHI activates several
early response target genes, including the genes encoding
erythropoietin (EPO) and EPO receptor, and proteins promot-
ing iron absorption, iron transport (transferrin), and heme
synthesis. In a placebo–controlled, phase 2a, 4-week treatment
study, roxadustat increased Hb levels in a dose-dependent
manner and improved iron homeostasis while modestly
and transiently increasing endogenous EPO levels within
or near physiologic range (22). We now report data from an
open label, phase 2b study of roxadustat administered for
16–24 weeks to patients with NDD-CKD who were anemic,
further exploring dose and frequency strategies to deter-
mine the optimal dose and regimen for phase 3 studies.
Materials and Methods
Study Design
This was a multicenter, open label, randomized study of
roxadustat in patients with stage 3 or 4 NDD-CKD conducted
at 36 sites in the United States (four sites in Puerto Rico). The
study consisted of a screening period of up to 4 weeks, a
treatment period of 16 or 24 weeks, and a 4-week follow-up
period. It was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01244763),
approved by all appropriate institutional review boards, and
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All
patients provided written informed consent.
Patients and Treatment
Eligible patients with NDD-CKD were 18275 years of age
with eGFR=15259 ml/min per 1.73 m2, had mean screening
Hb #10.5 g/dl, had a baseline ferritin .30 ng/ml, had trans-
ferrin saturation (TSAT) $5%, and had not received ESAs for
the 12 weeks before enrollment (Supplemental Table 1).
In total, 145 patients were enrolled into six different dose
cohorts (A–F) of 24 patients each in cohorts A–E and 25
patients in cohort F (Table 1). These cohorts were selected
to determine which dose strategy (fixed versus tiered
weight based) and which dose regimen (thrice weekly
[TIW] or twice weekly [BIW]) produced optimal desired
initial Hb response. During maintenance therapy, less fre-
quent dosing options were assessed. Patients were initially
randomized to cohorts A and B in parallel for 16 weeks of
treatment. After their completion, two 24-week treatment
cohorts, cohorts C and D, were then randomized in paral-
lel. After completion of randomization cohorts A–D, the
last two 24-week treatment cohorts, cohorts E and F, en-
rolled patients. Randomization was performed centrally
across all sites using a predetermined randomization
schedule with permuted block design. None of the sites
had access to the master randomization schedule, and the
sites received a treatment assignment for a patient only
after the patient met the enrollment criteria.
Cohorts A and B received starting roxadustat doses of 1.0–
1.7 mg/kg (on the basis of phase 2a experience) (22) TIW in
one of three doses tiered by body weight, whereas cohort E
received tiered weight starting dose BIW (Table 1). Cohorts
C, D, and F received three fixed starting doses of 50, 100, and
70 mg TIW (regardless of weight), respectively.
Hb was measured weekly, and Hb response was defined
as an increase from baseline Hb (DHb) $1.0 g/dl and Hb
level $11.0 g/dl. Doses could be titrated every 4 weeks.
After an Hb response was achieved, the roxadustat dose
frequencies that were used for Hb maintenance were that
cohorts A, C, and D continued TIW, cohort B switched to
BIW (from TIW), cohort E switched to once weekly (QW)
from BIW, and cohort F first switched to BIW from TIW
and, after stable Hb, to QW (Table 1).
ESAs, intravenous (iv) iron, androgens, and RBC transfusions
were prohibited. Use of oral iron was allowed but not required.
Dose Modifications
Investigators titrated roxadustat doses on the basis of
cohort–specific adjustment rules to correct and maintain
Hb levels to prespecified Hb targets of 11.0–13.0 g/dl for
cohorts A, B, E, and F and 10.5–12.0 g/dl for cohorts C and
D (Supplemental Table 2). Maximum roxadustat dose was
capped at 2.2 mg/kg per dose for cohorts A–D and 2.5 mg/kg
for cohorts E and F.

 Doses were held/decreased when Hb rate of rise was
.1.5 g/dl within the first 3 weeks or $2.0 g/dl during any
2-week treatment period or if Hb level was $14.0 g/dl at
any time (Supplemental Table 2).
Assessments
The primary end point was the cumulative proportion of
patients in each cohort achieving Hb response by the end of
week 16. To evaluate the full treatment effect in evaluable
patients with 24 weeks of treatment, Hb response rates
through end of treatment are also presented. The effect of
roxadustat on Hb values was also assessed by mean Hb
over time. The schedule of assessments and extent of missing
data are provided in Supplemental Table 3.
Safety was assessed by physical examinations, electro-
cardiograms, laboratory tests, and adverse events (AEs;
from onset of treatment through end of follow-up). Hepcidin,
serum iron, transferrin, TSAT, and ferritin were measured
(Supplemental Table 4). Lipid profiles were performed on
stored serum samples at the end of the study.
Statistical Analyses
Twenty-four patients per cohort were enrolled to eval-
uate Hb responses to different dosing regimens. The
efficacy-evaluable population consisted of patients receiv-
ing at least 2 weeks of study treatment with valid baseline
and post–treatment Hb measurements.
DHb from baseline used the pooled variance from all
groups (analysis of covariance model). Time to response
was estimated (Kaplan–Meier test). Additional analyses
included simple ANOVA, mixed model repeated measure
ANOVA, and chi-squared test as appropriate. All analyses
used SAS (v9.1.3; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Statistical
significance was on the basis of P#0.05 unadjusted for
multiple comparisons. Results are presented as
means6SDs (in the text and tables) and means6SEMs (in
the figures). Missing data were imputed using last obser-
vation carried forward. Hb values for patients receiving
blood transfusions were censored after transfusion.
Results
Patient Disposition
Of 357 patients screened, 145 were enrolled (safety
population), of whom 143 were efficacy evaluable. Twenty-
four patients were enrolled in each cohort (25 in cohort F). All
randomized patients received roxadustat. Twelve patients
(8.3%) discontinued treatment prematurely: consent with-
drawal (n=5); AEs (n=6), four of which were fatal (see below);
and noncompliance (n=1). The participant flow diagram is
provided as Figure 1.
Patient Characteristics at Baseline
Although minor differences existed among cohorts
with regards to age, sex, and the presence of diabetes and
hypertension, patient demographics and baseline charac-
teristics were similar (Table 2). Mean baseline Hb (mean of
three Hb values) was 9.7 g/dl (range =7.0–10.7 g/dl). Only
52.4% of patients were iron replete (ferritin .100 ng/ml
and TSAT.20%); 45 of 145 patients were receiving oral
iron at randomization, which was continued through end
of study. Eight patients began oral iron during the treat-
ment phase.
Efficacy
Overall cumulative Hb response rate (efficacy-evaluable
patients across all cohorts; n=143) was 91.6% (Figure 2A,
Table 3). Median times to Hb response were shorter in the
cohorts with higher weekly starting dose than those with
lower weekly starting dose: 28 days in cohorts A, B, and
D versus 35 days in cohort E, 49 days in cohort C, and
56 days in cohort F.
Correction Phase. In the first 4 weeks of dosing, mean
Hb increases in individual cohorts ranged from 0.6 to 1.7 g/dl.
Higher starting dose cohorts A, B, and D achieved larger
initial 4-week mean Hb increases of 1.7, 1.1, and 1.5 g/dl,
respectively, than lower starting dose cohorts C, E, and F,
with Hb increases of 0.57, 0.77, and 0.61 g/dl, respectively
(Figure 2B).
In the first 4 weeks of therapy, initial mean Hb increases
varied inversely with tertile of body weight in the fixed
starting dose cohorts (cohorts C, D, and F) (Table 3), an
effect absent in the three tiered weight dose cohorts.
Maintenance of Target Hb. Among the cohorts achiev-
ing prompt Hb correction (cohorts A, B, and D), mean Hb
levels were maintained in a vast majority of patients at end
of treatment.
The two TIW tiered weight dose cohorts achieved initial
Hb correction in 83% and 100% of patients, with durability
of response (two consecutive Hb values between 10.5 and
13.0 g/dl over the final 8 weeks of treatment) in 70% and
96% of patients. Furthermore, 84% and 96% of initial
responders were able to maintain Hb, despite 20%–30%
dose reductions in mean weekly maintenance dose that in-
cluded BIW frequency conversion in cohort B (from TIW).
In the highest nonweight–based dose cohort receiving
100 mg TIW and the tiered weight 70–150 mg BIW cohort,
96% of patients achieved initial Hb correction, with dura-
bility of response in 92% and 75% of patients, respectively.
Additionally, 96% and 78% of initial responders in the two
highest nonweight–based dose cohorts (70 and 100 mg, re-
spectively) were able to maintain Hb, despite 22%–25%
reductions in mean weekly maintenance dose, including
conversion from BIW to QW dosing.
Five patients (3.4%) received RBC transfusion. One
patient each had gastrointestinal bleed, hemorrhage during
scheduled surgery, and a low Hb after study treatment.
Two patients underwent transfusion between days 9 and
15 before HIF-PHI treatment could meaningfully affect Hb.
Hb correction was independent of baseline C–reactive
protein (CRP). Overall, mean maximum change in Hb
(DHbmax) during the first 12 weeks of treatment was
1.7661.14 g/dl. After 12 weeks of treatment, mean
DHbmax values were similar between patients with baseline
CRP #5 ng/ml (+1.8261.24 g/dl; n=90) and those with
baseline CRP .5 ng/ml (+1.5261.14 g/dl; n=47; P=0.14).
Hb response rate and DHb were independent of baseline
iron repletion status. Among iron-replete patients (base-
line ferritin .100 ng/ml and TSAT.20%), mean DHb at
the end of treatment was 1.56 (61.03) g/dl, and 90.5%
achieved Hb response (n=74). Among those not iron
replete at baseline, mean DHb at the end of treatment was
similar at 1.27 (61.14) g/dl (P=0.17), and 92.8% achieved
984

 Hb response (n=69). No significant effect of oral iron
administration on Hb levels was observed over the first
16 weeks of therapy.
Exploratory Measures
Baseline hepcidin correlated with baseline CRP (r=0.35;
P,0.001). After 16 weeks of treatment, mean (6SD) hepcidin
decreased by 27.7 (6107.2) ng/ml (16.9%) from baseline
(P=0.004), whereas ferritin decreased by 85.9 (6112.6) ng/ml
(30.9%; P,0.001) (Supplemental Table 4). Total iron-binding
capacity increased by 40.4 (641.0) mg/dl (15.3%; P,0.001).
Although TSAT and ferritin declined during initial weeks
of treatment, they were stable thereafter. The subgroup of
patients with the highest baseline TSAT and ferritin expe-
rienced greater declines in these parameters in cohorts re-
ceiving TIW dosing (Supplemental Figure 1). Despite these
changes in TSAT and ferritin, mean reticulocyte hemoglo-
bin content (CHr) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV)
remained constant or modestly increased during the study,
despite active erythropoiesis. The above changes reverted
toward or exceeded baseline values after therapy ended
(Supplemental Table 4).
Mean overall platelet counts did not change significantly
during treatment. In the high responder cohorts A, B, and
D, the tertile of patients with the highest baseline platelet
counts experienced a significant mean reduction in platelet
count of 14% from baseline over the course of treatment
(P,0.05) at all but two time points after treatment week 8.
The platelet counts in the middle and lower tertiles did not
change during treatment (Figure 3).
Mean (6SD) baseline total cholesterol of 171 (645) mg/dl
(n=143 efficacy-evaluable patients) was reduced by 26
(630) mg/dl overall and 17–36 mg/dl (P,0.001 to P=0.02)
in all cohorts after 8 weeks of treatment (Figure 4). These
reductions persisted: 21 (632) mg/dl (P,0.001) after
16 weeks and 19 (637) mg/dl (P,0.001) after 24 weeks
(cohorts C–F only); thereafter, total cholesterol levels re-
turned toward baseline. Reduction in mean total choles-
terol was greater for patients with higher ($200 mg/dl)
versus lower (,200 mg/dl) baseline total cholesterol levels
at 8 weeks (39.6 versus 13.6 mg/dl, respectively) and
24 weeks (39.6 versus 13.6 mg/dl, respectively). Subgroup
analysis showed similar reductions in LDL cholesterol and
increases in HDL-to-LDL ratio, and magnitudes of changes
in total and LDL cholesterol were independent of patient
use of statins (Supplemental Figure 2).
Safety
Treatment-emergent AEs were reported by 116 (80%) of
145 patients enrolled (Table 4). Fifty-seven serious adverse
events (SAEs) were reported in 35 (24.1%) patients (Sup-
plemental Table 5). Six patients were discontinued from
treatment because of an AE or an SAE. Four of these were
fatal: pulmonary embolism, cardiopulmonary arrest (2), and
an unwitnessed death (Supplemental Table 3). The two non-
fatal AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were worsen-
ing congestive heart failure with peripheral edema in one
patient and insomnia in another patient. Twelve serious car-
diovascular events were reported in 11 patients, two of
which were reported after completion of roxadustat treat-
ment, and the other nine serious cardiovascular events
were reported before achieving Hb response. Five SAEs
resulted in deaths, all in patients with a history of signifi-
cant cardiovascular disease (Supplemental Table 6): four
during treatment (described above) and one (cerebral in-
farction and pulmonary edema) during follow-up. None of
the deaths were attributed to study medication, and none
of the SAEs was considered related to study drug.
During treatment, 14 patients (9.7%) had at least one
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) value between one and

occurred in cohorts A and B (16 weeks of treatment) after 1.1, 4.7, 13.3, and 13.4 weeks of dosing. The remaining eight discontinuations
occurred in cohorts C–F (24 weeks of treatment) after 1 day (single dose) and 2.6, 3.4, 8.1, 8.9, 11.1, 18.1, and 21.7 weeks of dosing.

patients (2.8%) had ALT greater than three times the ULN.
During the follow-up period, three patients had at least one
ALT greater than the ULN, with a similar pattern for
aspartate aminotransferase. No patient had total bilirubin
greater than the ULN at baseline or during follow-up, but
four (2.8%) patients had total bilirubin up to two times the
ULN during treatment. Liver function abnormalities were
transient only, and no patient met Hy’s Law.
Discussion
Roxadustat, an orally bioavailable HIF-PHI, is being
developed to treat CKD-associated anemia. In this phase 2b
study, various roxadustat dose regimens were evaluated
for 16 and 24 weeks in patients with NDD-CKD. Both fixed
and weight-based dosing corrected Hb levels, providing
a range of Hb increases and median correction times to
be considered for phase 3 testing. These data show the
flexibility in dosing frequency (TIW, BIW, and QW) during
maintenance therapy.
The package label for conventional ESA therapy requires
iron repletion and often, iv iron supplementation (23). In
contrast, roxadustat corrected anemia and maintained Hb
without iv iron, despite baseline iron depletion in almost
one half of the patients. Although TSAT and ferritin de-
creased during the initial Hb response, these parameters sub-
sequently stabilized, permitting the continued maintenance

 of Hb levels at TSAT and ferritin thresholds lower than those
required during ESA treatment. The ability to maintain this
correction for longer periods of time without iv iron will be
tested in phase 3 studies. Furthermore, CHr levels were
maintained, despite robust erythropoiesis, indicating ab-
sence of functional iron deficiency during roxadustat treat-
ment. Iron used in erythropoiesis in these patients could
have come from mobilization of internal stores as well as
from oral iron supplementation, but the latter was given to
only 37% of patients. Hb response in patients who were not
iron replete and not on oral iron at baseline was as good as
in those who were iron replete and on oral iron.
Hepcidin levels decreased with roxadustat treatment.
This negative regulator of iron absorption and mobilization
is elevated with inflammation and sequesters iron imped-
ing erythropoiesis. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) acts as
an iron sensor (24); HIF stabilization is associated with
hepcidin suppression, increased intestinal iron absorption
(25), and increases in iron transport enzymes. In HIF-2a
knockout mice, intestinal HIF-2a induces iron absorption
genes and increases serum iron necessary for effective
erythropoiesis (26). Hepcidin likely mediates part of the
mechanism by which inflammation results in hyporespon-
siveness to ESAs (27,28). CRP, an inflammatory marker, is
elevated in approximately 25% of patients with CKD (29).
In contrast to ESAs, where lower Hb responses are report-
ed in patients with higher CRP who were inflamed (30),
responses to roxadustat were independent of the degree of
baseline inflammation reflected by CRP levels. Thus, hep-
cidin reduction by roxadustat potentially enables coordi-
nated erythropoiesis, regardless of inflammation or
exogenous iron supplementation.
Treatment with roxadustat had different effects on
platelet levels and MCV of RBCs than that described with
ESAs. ESA treatment can increase platelet count and de-
crease MCV (31,32), both possibly related to functional iron
deficiency. In contrast, treatment with roxadustat was as-
sociated with stable platelet counts and even decreasing
platelet counts in those in the highest baseline tertile. We
hypothesize that patients with the most elevated baseline
platelet counts had some degree of reactive thrombocytosis
because of iron deficiency (functional or otherwise) amelio-
rated by roxadustat through improved iron transport and
metabolism, producing a decline in platelets. Evidence for
this improved iron metabolic state during roxadustat treat-
ment is maintenance of CHr levels and MCV, despite ro-
bust erythropoiesis (a state incompatible with functional iron
deficiency), perhaps fostered by higher total iron-binding
capacity (31% increase) and thus, improved transferrin trans-
port of iron from tissue stores or oral absorption of die-
tary iron. Although these effects may reflect better iron
delivery/utilization, the precise mechanism, the extent to
which they minimize iron deficiency–mediated reactive
thrombocytosis, and the risk for thromboembolism require
additional exploration.
Mean total and LDL–associated cholesterol levels fell
with roxadustat treatment. Cholesterol reduction oc-
curs during high-altitude exposure (33). The potential
cholesterol-lowering effect of roxadustat may be mediated,
in part, by the effects of HIF on degradation of the rate-
limiting enzyme, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reduc-
tase (34). Although a reduction in total and LDL cholesterol
may be a benefit, because dyslipidemia and hypertension
are risk factors for cardiovascular disease in patients with
CKD, the potential for this benefit requires assessment in
larger future trials.
Roxadustat was well tolerated with no drug-related
SAEs reported in this study. All serious cardiovascular

 events reported during the treatment period occurred
before achieving anemia correction to Hb$11.0 g/dl;
Hb$11.0 g/dl was maintained during a major portion of
the roxadustat treatment period in this study. In contrast to
the hypertensive risks of ESAs, no SAEs of hypertension
were reported in this study. The reported rate of hyperten-
sive AEs (7.6% of treated patients) was below what has
been reported for similar patient populations treated with
ESAs (16%–32%) (35,36) and comparable with placebo rates
seen in other similar studies in this patient population (37).
A recent CKD patient cohort study estimated 7.7 deaths
and 8.0 progression to dialysis initiation events per 100
patient-years for those with stage 4 CKD and 41.4 deaths and
9.4 progression to dialysis initiation events per 100 patient-
years for those with stage 5 CKD (38). With 145 such pa-
tients enrolled and followed for approximately one half of a
year, the occurrence of five deaths and the initiation of di-
alysis in seven patients were not unexpected. These data
need to be interpreted in the setting of the open label study
design, in which no comparator group was included, and
factor in the patients’ background comorbidities and risk
factors.
This study shows that roxadustat can potentially correct
anemia, regardless of inflammation or initial iron repletion
status, while reducing hepcidin and cholesterol levels in
patients with NDD-CKD. Roxadustat has a potentially
acceptable safety profile. We did not find ESA–associated
side effects, and the hepcidin- and cholesterol-lowering
activity of roxadustat has not been reported with ESAs.
Risks from iv iron supplementation may be obviated.
Taken together, these results informed the design of phase
3 studies investigating roxadustat as a novel oral therapeu-
tic and a potentially safer and more accessible alternative
to parenteral ESAs in the treatment of anemia secondary to
CKD.

aRegarding serious cardiovascular events, all patients had
been in the study for ,10 weeks, and none had achieved target
hemoglobin of 11 g/dl before the onset of the serious adverse
event. During their treatment period, patients had hemoglobin
,10 g/dl for 18% of the exposure time. Six of nine (67%) of
serious cardiovascular events occurred when hemoglobin
,10 g/dl. The remainder of the serious cardiovascular events
were experienced while patient hemoglobin was 10–11 g/dl.
No serious cardiovascular events were reported when hemo-
globin was $11 g/dl during the study, although this
hemoglobin range accounted for 52% of total patient
exposure.
bRenal serious adverse events and dialysis initiation. Of four
patients who reported acute renal serious adverse event, three
fully recovered from the events, and one progressed to dialysis.
The three patients reporting chronic renal serious adverse
event initiated dialysis. Clinical scenarios consistent with
volume depletion were judged to be a major contributing fac-
tor in a majority of the renal serious adverse events. Another
patient initiated hemodialysis without reporting a serious
adverse event. Of the five patients who initiated dialysis dur-
ing the study, two had stage 5 CKD with eGFR,15 ml/min per
1.73 m2 at baseline, and the other three patients had borderline
stage 4/5 CKD with baseline eGFR values of 15 or 16 ml/min
per 1.73 m2.
