 SUMMARY
UCn2 and UCn3 peptides have recently been infused to treat patients with heart failure (HF) but are limited by
their short half-lives. A 1-time intravenous injection of virus vectors encoding UCn2 or UCn3 provided sustained
increases in plasma concentrations of the peptides. This was associated with increases in both systolic and
diastolic left ventricular (LV) function, mediated by increased LV SERCA2a expression and Ca2þ handling. UCn2,
but not UCn3, gene transfer reduced fasting glucose and increased glucose disposal. These findings support
UCn2 and UCn3 gene transfer as potential treatments for HF and indicate that UCn2 may be an optimal
selection in patients with diabetes and HF. (J Am Coll Cardiol Basic Trans Science 2018;3:249–64) © 2018 The

C
ardiovascular disease is the most
common
cause
of
death
in
the
United States, with 300,000 deaths
and 550,000 new cases every year. Heart fail-
ure (HF) affects 6 million people in the
United States, and in those
with severe
symptoms, 40% die within 4 to 5 years of
onset despite optimal therapy (1,2). Because
of
this
poor
prognosis,
new
approaches,
including
gene
transfer,
are
warranted.
Many cardiovascular deaths are related to
diabetes mellitus: >35% of patients with cor-
onary disease have diabetes (3). More effec-
tive
therapies
for
cardiovascular
disease
and diabetes are needed.
The corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)
family includes CRF and urocortins 1 (UCn1),
2 (UCn2), and 3 (UCn3). Because of the po-
tential
deleterious
effects
of
long-term
exposure to CRF and UCn1 (4,5), we have
focused on UCn2 and UCn3 in our studies. In normal
humans, expression of UCn2 mRNA is found pre-
dominantly
in
skin
and
endometrium
(6);
UCn3
mRNA is found in the gastrointestinal tract and
endometrium (7). Circulating levels of UCn2 and UCn3
peptide in normal humans are rarely reported due to
their low concentrations. Plasma UCn2 in normal
males is <0.3 ng/ml (68 pmol/l) (8), and in normal
adult women, serum samples showed mean UCn3
concentrations of 0.2 ng/ml (51 pmol/l) (9).
The
actions
of
UCn1,
UCn2,
and
UCn3
are
governed
by
the
tissue
distribution
of
their
re-
ceptors, corticotropin-releasing hormone receptors 1
(CRHR1) and 2 (CRHR2). UCn1 has similar affinity for
CRHR1 and CRHR2, but UCn2 and UCn3 have high
affinity for CRHR2 alone. CRHR1 is predominantly
expressed in brain, while CRHR2 is expressed in
peripheral
tissues,
including
vascular
smooth
muscle, the gastrointestinal tract, skeletal muscle,
and myocardium (9,10). UCn2 and UCn3 peptide
infusions have beneficial cardiovascular effects, and
UCn2 and stresscopin (a UCn3 homolog) have been
used to treat patients with HF in early-stage clinical
trials (11,12).
UCn2 has beneficial inotropic effects, with modest
effects
on
cardiac
myocyte
30,50-cyclic
adenosine
monophosphate (cAMP) production. In preclinical
studies in murine HF, infusion of UCn2 peptide
increased left ventricular (LV) contractile function
(13). Studies in large animals (14) and clinical trials
(11,12) have demonstrated the safety and beneficial
effects of UCn2 peptide infusion on LV function.
UCn3 peptide infusion, less studied, is also reported
to have beneficial cardiovascular effects (15).
An unanticipated and previously unrecognized ef-
fect
of
sustained
elevation
of
plasma
UCn2
is
increased insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal,
features that recently were shown to provide long-
term resolution of insulin resistance in 2 murine
models (16). It is unknown whether UCn2 or UCn3
gene transfer influences glucose disposal in normal
animals.
A direct comparison of the cardiovascular effects
between brief UCn2 and UCn3 peptide infusions
in human males with and without HF was only
recently conducted (15). This study compared the

 cardiovascular effects of brief intra-arterial infusion
of UCn2 and UCn3 peptides. Both peptides resulted in
arterial vasodilation, although UCn3 showed tachy-
cardia associated with reduced diastolic blood pres-
sure at the highest infused dose (15), suggesting
variations in the effects of UCn2 versus UCn3, despite
their similar affinities for CRHR2. This study did not
include measures of LV pressure.
The major impediment in using UCn2 and UCn3
peptide infusions in clinical settings as therapeutic
agents is their short half-life (minutes) (17). This
limits duration of treatment to a few hours. Gene
transfer would circumvent this shortcoming. In this
approach, one would construct a virus vector encod-
ing UCn2 or UCn3, and deliver the vector systemi-
cally. Using proper vectors, one could efficiently
transfect the liver and other organs, which then
would serve as sources for sustained synthesis of
UCn2 or UCn3, enabling sustained elevation of plasma
UCn2 and UCn3, circumventing the need for constant
infusion
and
hospitalization.
Our
laboratory
has
shown in preclinical studies that such an approach,
using gene transfer of UCn2, is feasible and beneficial
for heart function. Specifically, we have shown that a
single intravenous (IV) injection of adeno-associated
virus type 8 (AAV8) encoding UCn2 (AAV8.UCn2),
increases plasma UCn2 for up to 7 months, increases
function of normal and failing hearts in mice (18,19),
and normalizes insulin sensitivity in 2 animal models
of insulin resistance (16).
There are 2 unanswered questions that we address
in the current study. First, does sustained elevation
of plasma UCn2 versus UCn3 have different effects on
LV function and LV Ca2þ handling? Second, does
UCn3 gene transfer, similar to UCn2 gene transfer,
affect glucose disposal? Our hypothesis was that
sustained elevation of plasma UCn3, achieved via
gene transfer, would be dissimilar to the effects of
sustained elevation of plasma UCn2 on cardiovascular
function and glucose disposal.
METHODS
AAV8 VECTOR PRODUCTION. AAV8 vectors encod-
ing murine UCn2 and UCn3 driven by a chicken b-actin
(CBA)
promoter
were
produced
(AAV8.CBA.UCn2
and AAV8.CBA.UCn3) (Figure 1D). Virus titers were
determined
by
real-time
quantitative
polymerase
chain reaction with virus genome DNA prepared from
purified virus. Details of vector manufacture have been
reported previously (16,18).
ANIMAL STUDIES. The Animal Use and Care Com-
mittee
of
the
VA
San
Diego
Healthcare
System
approved the studies. A total of 130 male C57BL/6J
mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Maine) 11.5 �
0.3 weeks old, weighing 26.5 � 0.2 g were used. One
animal (UCn3 group) died during surgical implanta-
tion of the telemetry unit (severe bleeding), and 4
animals (3 saline and 1 UCn2) were found dead 1 to 3
days after the procedure. Data were obtained 9.0 �
0.2 weeks after gene transfer.
HEART RATE AND BLOOD PRESSURE IN CONSCIOUS
MICE. Telemetry transmitters (HD-X11, Data Sciences
International, St. Paul, Minnesota) were implanted
following the manufacturer’s guidelines). A fluid-
filled pressure transducer line was inserted through
the left carotid artery into the proximal aorta distal to
the subclavian artery. Recording commenced 5 or
more days after implantation. Data transmitted from
the telemetry units enabled continuous recording of
the electrocardiogram, phasic arterial blood, and
activity (Ponemah software version 6.3, Data Sciences
International). Electrocardiograms, blood pressure,
and activity were recorded continuously for 72 h.
Data were averaged over two 4-h periods: 10 AM to 2 PM
(day cycle) and 10 PM to 2 AM (night cycle). Activity was
quantified over each 4-h period (day and night), and
is reported as mean movements during each 5-min
interval.
VECTOR DELIVERY. Mice were anesthetized (1.5%
isoflurane), and a jugular vein was exposed through a
small incision on the neck. A final volume of 100 ml of
saline containing AAV8.UCn2 or AAV8.UCn3 (5 � 1011
genome copies [gc] per mouse; 1.9 � 1013 gc/kg) or
saline (control) was delivered IV via a 31-ga needle.
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY. Echocardiography
was
per-
formed using a Vevo 2100 system with a MS550s
(32 to 56 MHz) transducer (Visualsonics, Toronto,
Ontario, Canada), as previously described (18). To
examine mitral inflow, mice were injected intraperi-
toneally
with
10 mg/kg
ivabradine
hydrochloride
(Sigma-Aldrich,
St.
Louis,
Missouri)
in
double-
distilled
water
to
reduce
heart
rate
without
affecting contractile function (20). Using pulsed-
wave and tissue Doppler, mitral inflow and mitral
annulus velocities were acquired from a 2-chamber
view. Vevo software (Visualsonics, version 2.1) was
used for measurement and analysis.
LV
FUNCTION. Sodium
pentobarbital
(80
mg/kg,
intraperitoneally) was used for anesthesia. LV pres-
sure was measured using a 1.4-F micromanometer
catheter
(SPR
839,
Millar
Instruments,
Houston,
Texas) as previously described (18). LV systolic and
diastolic function were assessed using the first de-
rivative of LV pressure development (þdP/dt) and
decay (�dP/dt), respectively. The time constant of LV
pressure decline (Tau) was also measured as an added

 assessment
of

function.
To
determine
whether increases in peak LV þdP/dt and ejection
fraction (EF) were associated with relatively load-
independent changes in LV contractile function, we
measured the slope of the end-systolic pressure-
volume relationship (ESPVR) and cardiac output (CO),
as previously described (21).
FASTING
GLUCOSE
AND
GLUCOSE
TOLERANCE
TESTING. To determine whether UCn2 and UCn3
gene transfer were associated with similar alterations
in glucose disposal in normal mice, we measured
fasting glucose and glucose tolerance 9.0 � 0.2 weeks
after UCn2 and UCn3 gene transfer in normal male
mice. They were provided (ad libitum) a cereal-based
diet (Harlan Teklad Lab, Madison, Wisconsin). Mice
were housed (20�C to 21�C) with lights off from 6 PM to
6 AM daily. Normal mice received IV saline (n ¼ 12),
AAV8.UCn2 (1.9 � 1013 gc/kg, n ¼ 10) or AAV8.UCn3
(1.9 � 1013 gc/kg, n ¼ 12). Eight to 10 weeks later,
fasting (12 h) glucose was determined, and glucose
tolerance
testing
was
performed
as
previously
described (16). Area under the curve was calculated
for individual animals using the area under the curve
analysis
software
in
GraphPad
Prism
(GraphPad
Software version 6.07, La Jolla, California). We then
used these data (mean � SE) to test for between-
group differences.
NECROPSY AND TISSUE COLLECTION. Anesthetized
mice underwent a terminal procedure during which
blood was collected in EDTA tubes (BD Biosciences,
San
Jose,
California)
for
plasma
extraction
after
centrifugation for 10 min at 4,000 rpm and 4�C.
Organs were collected and weighed, and a part of
each was fast frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored
at �80�C, while another part was fixed in 10%
formalin and transferred to 70% ethanol 24 h later.
CARDIAC MYOCYTE ISOLATION AND SIZE ASSESSMENT.
Isolation
of
cardiac
myocytes
was
done
using
methods previously described (22). Viable cardiac
myocytes underwent cAMP and protein kinase A
(PKA) assays, and Ca2þ transient measurement. A
portion of cardiac myocytes were fixed (10% formalin,
10 min), washed twice with PBS, stained with eosin
for 10 min, washed twice with PBS, and then plated.
Photographs were taken (10� magnification) and the
size of 120 � 11 cardiac myocytes per animal was
quantified using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda,
Maryland).
Group
identity
was
unknown
to
the
examiner. Cells that were spherical (nonviable) and
those overlaid or attached to other cells (viable cell
clusters) were excluded. Length and width were
measured. Cell volume was calculated assuming a
cylindrical model:
Volume ¼ Length � pðWidth=2Þ2
CA2D TRANSIENTS. Ca2þ transient measurement was
performed as
previously
described
(18). Multiple
cardiac myocytes from each of 4 hearts per group
were used.
ADENYLYL CYCLASE AND PROTEIN KINASE A ACTIVITY
ASSAYS. Adenylyl cyclase activity was determined by
measuring the amount of cAMP in isolated cardiac
myocytes as previously described (23).
IMMUNOBLOTTING
AND
LV
mRNA
SCREENING.
Western blots were performed as described previ-
ously (18,19). Sources for antibodies include: anti–
p286-CAMKIIa
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas,
Texas); anti–p2808-RYR2 (Abcam, Cambridge, Mas-
sachusetts); anti-GAPDH (Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers,
Massachusetts);
anti-vinculin
(Sigma-
Aldrich).
To
evaluate
alterations
in
LV
mRNA
expression, we used focus gene arrays for cAMP and
Ca2þ
signaling
pathways
(Qiagen,
Germantown,
Maryland), which screens expression of 84 proteins
responsive to cAMP or Ca2þ.
HISTOLOGY. Transmural sections of the LV and liver
samples were fixed in 10% formalin (Sigma-Aldrich),
paraffin-embedded, sliced into 5-mm sections, moun-
ted, and then counterstained with hematoxylin and
eosin, and with Masson’s trichrome. The slides were
scanned using an Axio Scan Z1 slide scanner (Zeiss,
Oberkochen, Germany). Quantitative assessment was
performed using ImageJ version 1.49 software.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. Data acquisition and anal-
ysis were done without knowledge of group identity.
Group sizes were determined by power calculations.
GraphPad Prism V6.07 software was used for statis-
tical analysis. Data represent mean � SE; 1-way
analysis of variance and Kruskal-Wallis tests were
used to detect differences in the 3 groups. Sidak and
Dunn multiple comparison tests were then used to
test for between-group differences (UCn2 vs. UCn3).
In some instances, when comparisons were made
between 2 groups, the Student t test was used
(unpaired, 1-tailed). The null hypothesis was rejected
when p < 0.05.

 Mice that received AAV8.UCn2 (1.9 � 1013 gc/kg, IV)
had a 20-fold increase in plasma UCn2 levels: control
(n ¼ 8): 0.8 � 0.1 ng/ml (181 pmol/l); UCn2 (n ¼ 8):
16 � 1 ng/ml (3,627 pmol/l); p < 0.0001 (Figure 1E).
Mice that received AAV8.UCn3 (1.9 � 1013 gc/kg, IV)
had a 70-fold elevation in plasma UCn3 level: control
(n ¼ 8) 0.1 � 0.1 ng/ml (26 pmol/l); UCn3 (n ¼ 6):
7 � 0.4 ng/ml (1,785 pmol/l); p < 0.0001 (Figure 1E).
HEART RATE AND BLOOD PRESSURE. Heart rate and
blood
pressure
were
obtained
from
untethered,
conscious, unsedated mice via telemetry. The antici-
pated increase in nocturnal activity was associated
with increases in heart rate and blood pressure during
the night compared with daytime when the animals
were roughly 50% less active (Table 1). However, no
overall group differences were seen in heart rate or in
activity levels. Daytime diastolic (p ¼ 0.05) and mean
blood pressures (p ¼ 0.039) were decreased similarly
in UCn2 and UCn3 groups. Although there was a
reduction in systolic blood pressure of UCn2 and
UCn3 animals, it was not significant during daytime
(p ¼ 0.07). At night, systolic (p ¼ 0.034), diastolic
(p ¼ 0.047), and mean blood pressure (p ¼ 0.02) were
decreased in UCn2 and UCn3 mice, with no between-
group differences (Table 1).
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY. Eight to 10 weeks after UCn2
or UCn3 gene transfer, EF (p < 0.0001) and velocity of
circumferential fiber shortening corrected for heart
rate (VCFc) (p < 0.0001) were increased in both UCn2
and UCn3 groups compared with control (Table 2).
UCn2
had
a
greater
effect
than
UCn3
on
EF
(p ¼ 0.0013) and VCFc (p < 0.0001). There was an
overall reduction in end-diastolic diameter (EDD) and
end-systolic diameter (ESD) (p < 0.0001 for both)
(Table 2), with reduced EDD and ESD greater after
UCn2 gene transfer than after UCn3 gene transfer
(p ¼ 0.0007 and p < 0.0002, respectively). Both UCn2
and UCn3 transgenes increased passive mitral inflow
(MV E-wave). UCn2 or UCn3 gene transfer did not
affect the ratio of passive to active mitral inflow
velocity (E/A).
LV
FUNCTION. UCn2
versus
UCn3
gene
transfer
resulted in a 1.5-fold and 1.4-fold increase, respec-
tively, in the peak rate of LV pressure development
(þdP/dt) compared with control (control 5,448 � 277
mm Hg/s, n ¼ 18; UCn2 8,314 � 340 mm Hg/s, n ¼ 8;
UCn3 7,553 � 388 mm Hg/s, n ¼ 20; p < 0.0001)
(Figure 2A). UCn2 gene transfer increased the slope
of the ESPVR by
90%, and UCn3
gene transfer
increased the slope of the ESPVR by 63% (control
4.0 � 0.3 ml/min, n ¼ 9; UCn2 7.6 � 1.2 ml/min, n ¼ 6;
UCn3 6.5 � 1.1 ml/min, n ¼ 8; p ¼ 0.02) (Figure 2B).
Both transgenes increased the peak rate of LV pres-
sure decay (�dP/dt), with UCn2 resulting to a 1.3-fold
increase and UCn3 a 1.2-fold increase (control �5,597
� 292 mm Hg/s, n ¼ 18; UCn2 �7,212 � 357 mm Hg/s,
n ¼ 8; UCn3 �6,859 � 342 mm Hg/s, n ¼ 20; p ¼ 0.006)
(Figure 2C). Tau was reduced 31% and 24% by UCn2
and
UCn3
gene
transfer,
respectively
(control
8.6 � 0.3 ms, n ¼ 9; UCn2 5.9 � 0.6 ms, n ¼ 8; UCn3

In Vivo Assessment of LV Function
Eight to 10 weeks after IV delivery of AAV8.UCn2 or AAV8.UCn3 (1.9 � 1013 gc/kg) or saline, mice underwent physiological studies to assess LV function.
(A and B) Peak rate of LV pressure development (A) (þdP/dt) and the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR) (B), a relatively
load-independent measurement of LV contractility, were both increased by UCn2 and UCn3 gene transfer, with no between-group differences. (C and D)
Peak rate of LV pressure decline (�dP/dt) (C) and the time constant of LV pressure decline (Tau) (D), measures of LV diastolic function, were both
increased by UCn2 and UCn3 gene transfer, with no between-group differences. (E) Cardiac output (CO) was increased by UCn2 and UCn3 gene transfer,
with no difference between UCn2 and UCn3. (F) LV developed pressure (LVP) showed no group differences. (G) Heart rate (HR) in anesthetized animals
was increased by UCn2 and UCn3 gene transfer, with no between-group differences. Individual data are shown (mean � SE); p values are from 1-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA). LV ¼ left ventricle; LVP ¼ left ventricular developed pressure; other abbreviations as in Figure 1.

 increased by UCn2 and UCn3 gene transfer by 65%
and 50%, respectively (control 3.69 � 0.35 ml/min,
n ¼ 9; UCn2 6.10 � 0.66 ml/min, n ¼ 8; UCn3 5.53 �
0.81 ml/min, n ¼ 8; p ¼ 0.03) (Figure 2E). LV devel-
oped
pressure
showed
no
group
differences
(Figure 2F). Heart rate under anesthesia was increased
in mice that had received UCn2 or UCn3 gene transfer
(control 391 � 10 beats/min, n ¼ 18; UCn2 457 � 13
beats/min, n ¼ 8; UCn3 416 � 14 beats/min, n ¼ 20;
p ¼0.01) (Figure 2G). There were no group differences
between UCn2 and UCn3 effects on þdP/dt (p ¼ 0.2),
ESPVR slope (p ¼ 0.4), �dP/dt (p ¼ 0.5), Tau (p ¼ 0.4),
CO (p ¼ 0.5), or heart rate (p ¼ 0.06).
CYTOSOLIC
CA2D
TRANSIENTS. Cardiac myocytes
were isolated 9.0 � 0.2 weeks after gene transfer or
saline injection and used for Ca2þ transient assess-
ment. There were group differences in peak cytosolic
Ca2þ concentration (p < 0.007) (Figures 3A and 3B).
Both UCn2 and UCn3 increased peak cytosolic Ca2þ
concentration, although there was no between-group
difference in UCn2 versus UCn3 (p ¼ 0.19). Tau, the
time constant for the rate of LV pressure decline and a
measure of LV diastolic function, showed a group dif-
ference (p ¼ 0.0003) (Figure 3C). UCn2 and UCn3 gene
transfer reduced the time constant similarly (control
0.16 � 0.006 s, n ¼ 52; UCn2 0.14 � 0.005 s, n ¼ 54; UCn3
0.14 � 0.004 s, n ¼ 61). The time to peak cytosolic Ca2þ
concentration showed no group difference (Figure 3D).
LV
SIGNALING. There were no group differences
in LV cAMP levels or PKA activity (Figures 4A and 4B).
LV levels of phosphorylated Ca2þ/calmodulin-depen-
dent protein kinase II (CaMKII, isoform a) were
reduced (p ¼ 0.0024) by both UCn2 (71% reduction)
and UCn3 (55% reduction) gene transfer (Figure 4C).
Phosphorylated ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2) protein
levels
showed
group
differences
(p
¼
0.013)
(Figure 4D), solely attributable to a 59% reduction
associated with UCn2 gene transfer. LV sarco/endo-
plasmic reticulum Ca2þ-ATPase (SERCA2a) protein
levels were increased similarly in UCn2 and UCn3
groups (p ¼ 0.04) (Figure 4E).
We also measured LV mRNA expression of key
signaling proteins (Table 3), which revealed some
differences in the effects of UCn2 versus UCn3 gene
transfer. For example, although cardiac myosin light
chain
kinase
expression
was
increased
by
gene
transfer of UCn2 and UCn3 (p ¼ 0.006), the increase
following UCn3 gene transfer was somewhat greater
in degree (UCn2 1.2-fold control; UCn3 1.4-fold con-
trol; p ¼ 0.042). In addition, insulin-like growth fac-
tor binding protein 3 mRNA was reduced 32% by
UCn2 gene transfer, but increased 19% by UCn3 gene
transfer
(group
difference
p
¼ 0.0033).
The
LV
expression of an additional 84 proteins in the cAMP/
Ca2þ
signaling
pathway
showed
that
fibroblast
growth factor 6 (FGF6) and neuropeptide Y (NpY)
were decreased by UCn2 and UCn3 gene transfer
similarly, while NpY1 receptor expression was un-
changed. These findings were confirmed by reverse-
transcription polymerase chain reaction (Table 3). LV
and liver UCn2 mRNA increased (209-fold and 5,173-
fold, respectively). The extent of UCn2 and UCn3
expression in liver was similar, but LV expression
was somewhat higher for UCn3 than UCn2 (Table 3).
FASTING
GLUCOSE
AND
GLUCOSE
TOLERANCE
TESTING. We previously showed that UCn2 gene
transfer was associated with increased insulin sensi-
tivity and increased glucose disposal (16). We there-
fore tested whether UCn2 and UCn3 gene transfer
affected glucose disposal in normal mice. We used
2 measures to quantify glucose disposal: fasting blood
glucose and glucose tolerance testing. Eight to 10
weeks after UCn2 and UCn3 gene transfer, fasting
(12-h) glucose was reduced in mice that had received
UCn2 gene transfer (p < 0.002 vs. control; p < 0.001 vs.
UCn3) (Figure 5). UCn3 gene transfer had no effect on
fasting glucose. In addition, glucose tolerance testing
confirmed a group difference in glucose clearance.
The area under the glucose-time curve showed an
overall group difference (p ¼ 0.015), which was solely
attributable to increased glucose clearance in mice
that had received UCn2 gene transfer (p ¼ 0.02 vs.
control; p < 0.02 vs. UCn3). UCn3 gene transfer, by
contrast, had no effect on glucose disposal (Figure 5).
NECROPSY. Mice showed no group differences in
body, liver, or lung weight (Table 4). However, UCn2
and
UCn3
gene
transfer
was
associated
with
a
reduction in LV weight (p ¼ 0.006) (Table 4). This
reduction persisted when LV weight was normalized
to body weight (p ¼ 0.0001) and was similarly
reduced in mice that had received UCn2 or UCn3 gene
transfer.
HISTOLOGY AND CARDIAC MYOCYTE SIZE. Histo-
logical inspection of transmural samples of LV and
liver samples from all 3 groups showed no abnor-
malities in inflammatory cell infiltrates or fibrosis.
Quantification of fibrosis showed no group differ-
ences (Figure 6). There were differences in cardiac
myocyte volume (p < 0.02, 1-way analysis of vari-
ance) (Figure 7). The mean values of 120 � 11 cells
measured from each individual animal were: control
36.6 � 1.1 pl, n ¼ 5; UCn2 31.2 � 1.4 pl, n ¼ 5;
UCn3 30.1 � 1.8 pl, n ¼ 5 (p < 0.02) (Figure 7). Thus,
cardiac myocytes from control mice were 15% larger
than those from UCn2 mice (p ¼ 0.06) and 18% larger
than those from UCn3 mice (p < 0.03). Cardiac

 myocytes from UCn2 and UCn3 groups had similar
volumes. Cardiac myocytes from control mice were
13% to 16% wider (control 20.9 � 1.8 mm, n ¼ 6; UCn2
18.1 � 0.6 mm, n ¼ 5; UCn3 17.5 � 0.5 mm, n ¼ 5;
p ¼ 0.10), but minimally longer (control 128.1 � 1.9
mm, n ¼ 6; UCn2 120.4 � 3.0 mm, n ¼ 5; UCn3
124.6 � 3.2 mm, n ¼ 5; p ¼ 0.26).
DISCUSSION
Sustained
elevation
of
plasma
concentrations
of
UCn2 versus UCn3, achieved via gene transfer, has
pronounced beneficial effects on LV systolic and LV
diastolic function (Figure 2). These beneficial effects
were associated with equivalent enhancement of
Ca2þ handling in cardiac myocytes (Figure 3) and
comparable increases in LV SERCA2a expression and
reductions in CaMKII phosphorylation (Figure 4).
UCn2, but not UCn3, gene transfer reduced LV RYR2
phosphorylation (Figure 4). However, despite 42%
amino acid sequence homology and binding the same
receptors (CRHR2) with similar affinity (Figures 1A
to 1C), UCn3 does not affect glucose disposal, while
UCn2 gene transfer does.
LV FUNCTION. Indications that UCn2 gene transfer
may have a greater benefit on systolic function than
UCn3 gene transfer were seen in echocardiographic
assessment. LV EF and VCFc were increased more by
UCn2 than by UCn3 gene transfer (p ¼ 0.0013 and
p < 0.0001, respectively) (Table 2). The comparable
beneficial effects of UCn2 and UCn3 gene transfer on

 Ca2þ transients and SERCA2a expression does not
explain the differences seen on echocardiography.
Given the similarity in LV peak þdP/dt (Figure 2),
which is less load-dependent than EF, the echocar-
diography differences may reflect small differences
in loading conditions rather than differences in LV
contractility per se.
In a previously published study, we reported that
LV �dP/dt was not altered 6 weeks after UCn2 gene
transfer in normal mice (18), but was at 4 months. In
the present study, we saw increased LV peak �dP/dt
9.0 � 0.2 weeks after gene transfer of either UCn2 or
UCn3. Both transgenes also reduced Tau, confirming
an important effect on LV diastolic function, which
was similar for both transgenes. The percent increase
in LV peak þdP/dt versus control (UCn2 53%; UCn3
39%), which was confirmed by increases in the ESPVR
slope (UCn2 90%; UCn3 63%), and in CO (UCn2 65%;
UCn3 50%) would be anticipated to have important
physiological effects, especially in the setting of HF.
DIFFERENCES IN PLASMA LEVELS OF UCn2 VERSUS
UCn3. One could argue that differences in the effects
of UCn2 versus UCn3 gene transfer (on RYR2 phos-
phorylation and EF, for example) simply reflect dif-
ferences in plasma levels of transgene: plasma UCn2
(16 ng/ml [3.6 nmol/l]) was higher than plasma UCn3
(7 ng/ml [1.8 nmol/l]) (Figure 1C). However, the rela-
tive changes were greater after UCn3 gene transfer
(70-fold increase) than after UCn2
gene transfer
(20-fold increase). The affinity of UCn2 and UCn3 for
the CRHR2 receptor is comparable, and their ability
to stimulate cAMP in cells stably transfected with
CRHR2b is similar (Figure 1C) (half-maximal effective
concentration [EC50] 0.05 to 0.08 nmol/l for cAMP
production) (24). By contrast, the EC50 for UCn2 and
UCn3 activation of CRHR1 is >100 nmol/l (24), a
concentration far in excess of what was achieved in
the present study (1.8 to 3.6 nmol/l). It therefore
seems likely that CRHR2 receptors were saturated,
CRHR1
receptors
minimally
activated,
and
that
downstream effects of activation were maximal at the
plasma concentrations obtained. It is possible that
the effects measured were not receptor-dependent.
However, in a previous study, we have shown the

parison test with correction). (E) LV SERCA2a protein levels were increased similarly by UCn2 and UCn3 gene transfer. Individual data are shown (mean �

 effects of UCn2 gene transfer on glucose disposal are
dose-dependent and absent in CRHR2-deleted mice
(16). An important consideration is whether there are
variations in the clearance of these peptides from
plasma, but we could find no data regarding the
specific peptidases involved. A structure analysis
excludes the likelihood that neprilysin or neurolysin
are involved. Endothelin converting enzyme-1, which
can cleave CRF and UCn1 at high agonist concentra-
tions at CRHR1 (25), are not known to play a role in
UCn2 and UCn3 degradation.
HEART RATE AND BLOOD PRESSURE. Although the
anticipated reductions in blood pressure were seen,
the reductions were equivalent following UCn2 and
UCn3 gene transfer, and no differences in heart rate
were observed (Table 1). These data, obtained in
untethered, unsedated mice, provide persuasive ev-
idence that unlike the case with IV infusion of UCn3
in human subjects (26), abnormally low blood pres-
sure is not seen with UCn2 or UCn3 gene transfer, and
there is no increase in heart rate. A plausible expla-
nation, given that UCn2 and UCn3 peptides lower
systemic vascular resistance (8,14,15), is that sus-
tained high plasma levels of these peptides are
associated with blunting of vasodilator and chrono-
tropic effects.
EFFECTS ON LV SIGNALING. UCn2 and UCn3 gene
transfer
equivalently
reduced
phosphorylation
of
CaMKII in LV samples (Figure 4). Thus, while this
may have contributed to the comparable increases in
LV function observed after gene transfer, it cannot
be the mechanism underlying differences in the ef-
fects of UCn2 versus UCn3. CaMKII expression and
activation are important determinants
of
cardiac
function, and its inhibition enhances LV function
(27). We previously showed that UCn2 gene transfer
reduces LV CaMKII expression in HF in mice (19).
Although we speculate that reduced Thr286 phos-
phorylation
of
CaMKII
may
have
contributed
to
increased LV function, we did not determine the
mechanism by which increased UCn2 or UCn3 evokes
this change.
We found that UCn2, but not UCn3, gene transfer
reduced
LV
RYR2
phosphorylation
(Figure
4).
Although the consequences of variations in RYR2
phosphorylation on LV function are debated (28), a
59% reduction in LV RYR2 phosphorylation is a
distinctive difference in the effects of UCn2 versus
UCn3 gene transfer, and RYR2 phosphorylation has
been linked to reduced arrhythmias and increased LV
function in HF (29,30). Although we screened LV
expression of 84 signaling proteins in the cAMP/Ca2þ
pathway, there were none that showed significant
directionally opposite effects of UCn2 versus UCn3
gene transfer.
REDUCED LV MASS. UCn2 and UCn3 gene transfer
were associated with similar reductions in LV mass.
The reduction, which was 14% for both UCn2 and UCn3
gene transfer, was significant (p ¼ 0.006) (Table 4), and
correlated closely with similar 15% to 18% reductions
in cardiac myocyte volume (Figure 7). Reduced cardiac
myocyte volume was mostly due to reduced cardiac
myocyte width with less reduction in length. The
mean cardiac myocyte volume in control mice (36.6 �
1.1 pl) is somewhat higher than those reported in rab-
bits (30.4 � 1.4 pl), ferrets (30.9 � 1.9 pl), and rats
(34.4 � 1.5 pl), measured by the same techniques (31).
The absence of fibrosis and the architecture of the
cardiac myocytes is compatible with a physiological
rather than a pathophysiological process. The reduc-
tion in blood pressure versus control conferred by
both UCn2 and UCn3 gene transfer (Table 1) is a
possible explanation for reduced LV mass. Indeed,
the mass difference may reflect, at least in part,
relative systolic hypertension in control mice versus
UCn2 and UCn3 mice, especially during nocturnal
activity (control 142 � 5 mm Hg; UCn2 123 � 6 mm Hg;

 UCn3 128 � 3 mm Hg). The reduction in LV CaMKII
phosphorylation seen following UCn2 and UCn3 gene
transfer (Figure 4) may also have played a role in the
reduction of LV mass. For example, pharmacological
inhibition of CaMKII reduces hypertension-induced
LV hypertrophy (32).
GLUCOSE DISPOSAL. A key difference in the effects
of UCn2 versus UCn3 gene transfer was that UCn2
gene transfer—but not UCn3 gene transfer—reduced
fasting blood glucose and increased glucose disposal
in normal mice. These data confirm those that we
previously published (16) regarding the effects of
UCn2 gene transfer on glucose disposal, but extend
the findings to indicate that the effect is UCn2-
specific, occurs even in normal animals, and is not
seen with UCn3 gene transfer. Why UCn3 does not
have this effect was not addressed in the current
study but is a focus of ongoing studies. Although the
assessment of insulin resistance is usually conducted
in the setting of obesity and pre-diabetes or diabetes,
it is a continuous variable and can be influenced by
physiological interventions in normal subjects. For
example, sedentary nondiabetic men showed signifi-
cant increases in insulin sensitivity after 24 weeks of
moderate-intensity dynamic exercise training (33). In
the present study, mice that received UCn2 gene
transfer experienced a reduction in glucose disposal
that likely reflects an increase in insulin sensitivity
(Figure 5).

have 42% sequence homology and bind the same re-
ceptors (CRHR2a and CRHR2b) (Figure 1C) (24). Why
then do we see differences in the effects of UCn2 versus
UCn3 gene transfer? Although similar, the affinities of
UCn2 for the 2 CRHR2 subtypes are somewhat tighter
than those of UCn3 (inhibitory constant [Ki] for
CRHR2a: UCn2 2.1 nmol/l; UCn3 5.0 nmol/l; Ki for
CRHR2b: UCn2 0.7 nmol/l; UCn3 1.8 nmol/l). These
small differences may be associated with variations
in
physiological
responsiveness.

 demonstrated that variation in 3-dimensional confor-
mation of the 2 peptides can alter agonist–receptor
interaction and thereby influence downstream effects
(34). In particular, the 3-dimensional structures of CRF
family peptides, including UCn2 and UCn3, possess
a-helical backbones with a turn (described as a kink) at
residues 25 to 27, resulting in a helix-loop-helix
morphology—these
2
helices
may
play
important
roles in receptor binding and affinity (35). UCn2 shows
a more acute angle between helices compared with
UCn3, and this may, at least in theory, alter receptor
activation (35). Finally, UCn3, but not UCn2, is required
for glucose- and incretin-stimulated insulin secretion
and is expressed in pancreatic b cells (36). However, if
transgene UCn3 increased insulin secretion in the
present study, it had no apparent effect on glucose
disposal.
IMPLICATION
FOR
HF
THERAPY. As
has
been
reported before, UCn2 and UCn3 (or its homolog,
stresscopin) have shown beneficial cardiovascular
effects in preclinical and clinical HF (11,12,14,15). In
those studies, UCn2 and UCn3 peptides were infused
IV or, in 1 case, intra-arterially (15). This approach,
due to the short half-life of the peptides, provided
benefits of limited duration. We have previously
shown that UCn2 gene transfer provides sustained
increases in both plasma UCn2 and cardiac function in
normal mice and in mice with HF (18,19). The current
study confirms the previous studies of UCn2 gene
transfer in normal mice and extends the findings to
UCn3 gene transfer where we also see sustained
increases in LV function.
CONCLUSIONS
UCn2 and UCn3 gene transfer reduce blood pressure
without increasing heart rate in untethered and
unsedated mice. LV mass is reduced by UCn2 and
UCn3 gene transfer, a possible sequela of reduced
blood pressure and diminished LV CaMKII phos-
phorylation.
Similar
and
substantial
increases
in
measures of LV systolic and diastolic function are
seen with UCn2 and UCn3 gene transfer, mediated by
increased LV SERCA2a expression and increased Ca2þ
handling. UCn2, but not UCn3, gene transfer reduced
fasting glucose and increased glucose disposal. These
findings suggest that UCn2 and UCn3 gene transfer
may be effective treatments for HF and indicate that
UCn2 may be an optimal selection in patients with
diabetes and HF. It remains to be determined whether
UCn3 gene transfer, like UCn2 gene transfer (19), in-
creases function of the failing heart. Further investi-
gation into precise molecular pathways by which
UCn2 and UCn3 gene transfer influence Ca2þ handling
and key Ca2þ handling proteins are underway.

Cardiac Myocyte Volume
Cardiac myocytes were isolated 9.0 � 0.2 weeks after intra-
venous delivery of saline, AAV8.UCn2 (1.9 � 1013 gc/kg) or
AAV8.UCn3 (1.9 � 1013 gc/kg). Viable isolated cardiac myocytes
were fixed in 10% formalin, stained with eosin and their size
was measured using ImageJ software. (A) Each symbol rep-
resents the mean volume of 120 � 11 cardiac myocytes
measured per mouse. Measures were made blinded to group
identity. (B) Representative isolated cardiac myocytes, indi-
cating cardiac myocyte length (red) and width (green). There
was an overall group difference in cardiac myocyte volume
(p < 0.02, Kruskal-Wallis) due to a larger volume in cardiac
myocytes from control mice. Between-group comparisons are
from the Dunn multiple comparison test. Abbreviations as in

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: HF and
diabetes are 2 of the most prevalent disorders encoun-
tered clinically, and both diseases have poor outcomes
despite recent advances in therapy. New strategies to
treat HF and diabetes urgently are needed. Data from the
current study indicate that gene transfer of UCn2 and
UCn3 increase systolic and diastolic function of the
normal heart, and that UCn2 gene transfer, but not UCn3
gene transfer, increases glucose disposal.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: The present paper is an
important step in translating UCn2 and UCn3 gene
transfer to clinical applications and adds to our
knowledge regarding the specificity of UCn2 gene
transfer in increasing glucose disposal. There are
2 potential obstacles to translation to clinical settings.
First, will sustained increases in plasma UCn2 or UCn3 be
well tolerated? A biodistribution and toxicology study of
the long-term and dose-related effects of UCn2 gene
transfer is underway. Second, will UCn3 gene transfer,
like UCn2 gene transfer, have a favorable impact in HF,
and will UCn3 have a favorable impact in diabetes? We
have recently shown that UCn2 gene transfer increases
function of the failing heart (19) and also restores insulin
sensitivity in 2 models of insulin resistance (16).
However, the effects of UCn3 gene transfer in preclinical
HF have not been tested. An exciting aspect of the
present data is the possibility that UCn2 or UCn3 gene
transfer—via a single IV administration—might provide
prolonged improvement in LV diastolic function in
patients with HF and preserved EF, a clinical problem
that has been resistant to effective therapy.
