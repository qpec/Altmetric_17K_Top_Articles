Abstract
Aims: frailty is proposed as a summative measure of health status and marker of individual vulnerability. We aimed to inves-
tigate the discriminative capacity of a frailty index (FI) derived from interRAI Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment for
Acute Care (AC) in relation to multiple adverse inpatient outcomes.
Methods: in this prospective cohort study, an FI was derived for 1,418 patients ≥70 years across 11 hospitals in Australia.
The interRAI-AC was administered at admission and discharge by trained nurses, who also screened patients daily for geri-
atric syndromes.
Results: in adjusted logistic regression models an increase of 0.1 in FI was significantly associated with increased likeli-
hood of length of stay >28 days (odds ratio [OR]: 1.29 [1.10–1.52]), new discharge to residential aged care (OR: 1.31
[1.10–1.57]), in-hospital falls (OR: 1.29 [1.10–1.50]), delirium (OR: 2.34 [2.08–2.63]), pressure ulcer incidence (OR: 1.51
[1.23–1.87]) and inpatient mortality (OR: 2.01 [1.66–2.42]). For each of these adverse outcomes, the cut-point at which
optimal sensitivity and specificity occurred was for an FI > 0.40. Specificity was higher than sensitivity with positive pre-
dictive values of 7–52% and negative predictive values of 88–98%. FI-AC was not significantly associated with readmis-
sions to hospital.
Conclusions: the interRAI-AC can be used to derive a single score that predicts multiple adverse outcomes in older inpati-
ents. A score of ≤0.40 can well discriminate patients who are unlikely to die or experience a geriatric syndrome. Whether
the FI-AC can result in management decisions that improve outcomes requires further study.

 Introduction
Frailty is proposed as a summative measure of health status
and marker of individual vulnerability. Older people who are
frail have a diminished capacity to compensate effectively for
external stressors and thus are vulnerable to adverse out-
comes [1]. Identification of inpatients who are frail has the
potential to target their care more appropriately. While frailty
status is attractive as a risk stratification tool, the evaluation of
frailty in the acute care (AC) setting has proven problematic.
Many inpatients are unable to complete the performance-
based tests integral to some frailty measures [2] and discrim-
inative ability may be lacking for tools that categorise the
majority of cohorts as ‘frail’ [3]. Comparison of multiple
frailty instruments has reported generally poor predictive prop-
erties [4] and low sensitivity for adverse events (AE) [5, 6].
The quantification of frailty by counting accumulated
deficits to determine a frailty index (FI) score has the
potential to overcome some of these challenges. A FI is
feasible for even bed-bound older inpatients [7] and as a
continuous rather than dichotomous measure may harness
greater granularity across the health spectrum. An electronic
FI (eFI) has recently been validated using health record
data in primary care [8]. An existing hospital-based assess-
ment system, which serves other clinical and administrative
purposes, can also be used to derive a FI. A FI derived
from the interRAI-Acute Care Instrument (FI-AC) [9]
increases with chronological age and reaches a 99% limit of
0.69, below the theoretical maximum of 1.0 [10]. The
strong association between the FI-AC and death has been
reported [10], but a valid frailty measure should be more
than a mortality-prediction tool. Geriatric syndromes such
as delirium, pressure ulcers and falls exert a high toll in per-
sonal suffering as well as greater healthcare costs [11, 12].
Functional decline and institutionalisation should also be
considered since these outcomes are of primary importance
to older people themselves [13].
Here, we evaluate the predictive validity of the FI-AC in
older inpatients. We consider how admission FI-AC score
relates to discharge destination and explore its association
with other clinically important adverse outcomes.
Methods
Setting and sample
Previous studies have described recruitment of the study
cohort [10, 14–16] and the relationship of polypharmacy with
adverse outcomes in hospitalised older people [17]. In brief,
1,418 patients aged 70 and older admitted to 11 AC hospitals
across Australia were recruited. These hospitals included
small secondary care centres, rural hospitals, metropolitan
teaching centres and major tertiary referral facilities. The
majority of patients (N = 1,220) were recruited from general
medical wards with 198 in orthopaedic or surgical wards.
Patients admitted to coronary or intensive care units, for pal-
liative care or for less than 24 h were excluded.
Measures
Frailty
The interRAI-AC tool, now known as the interRAI-AC-
Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (AC-CGA), was used
for data collection. This instrument was specifically devel-
oped for use in the acute setting to support CGA of older
inpatients [9, 18]. It collates information across a large
number of domains including sociodemographic data, phys-
ical, cognitive and psycho-social functioning, medications,
medical diagnoses, advance directives and discharge destin-
ation. Nurse assessors who were trained to use the
interRAI-AC instrument gathered data at admission (within
24 h in the ward) and discharge. To obtain information for
each item in the interRAI instrument, patient and family
interviews, direct observations, staff interview and medical
records were used. A number of scales embedded in the
interRAI instruments combine single items belonging to
domains such as activities of daily living (ADL), instrumen-
tal ADL and cognition; these are used to describe the pres-
ence and extent of deficits in these domains [18].
A frailty index (FI-AC) was calculated for each patient
using candidate variables recorded in the interRAI-AC.
Variables were chosen and coded as deficits according to
well-defined criteria [10]. Deficits included co-morbidities,
incontinence and pain as well as impairments in function,
sensorium, mood and cognition. Each individual’s deficit
points were summed and divided by the total number of def-
icits considered (here = 56). For example, an individual with
12 deficits out of 56 counted had an FI-AC of 0.21. The FI
has been contextualised against clinical descriptors: 0.25 has
been proposed as the cut-off between ‘fit’ and ‘frail’ in
community-dwelling older people [19] and scores of 0.4 and
above describe older people who are dependent on others
for ADL and have a significantly higher risk of death [20].
Outcome measures
Discharge destination
Discharge destination after the AC epi-
sode was classified on an ordinal scale as community, con-
tinuing inpatient care (including rehabilitation, palliative or
extended care), residential aged care (RAC) or death.
Newly discharged to RAC
Those not in RAC at admission
and who were discharged directly from AC to RAC, were
classified as newly discharged to RAC. Those who died in
hospital were excluded.
In-hospital mortality
In-hospital mortality was recorded for
those patients who died during the hospital episode.
Fall in hospital
In-hospital fall was defined as having at least
one fall during the period of hospitalisation. These data
were collected prospectively by the research nurses using all
available sources of information including interviewing the
patient and medical staff, daily ward visits to review medical
records and checking the forms or systems for recording
AEs.

 Functional decline
This was assessed using change in the ADL
short form scale that consists of four items (personal hygiene,
walking, toilet use and eating). Scores on the ADL scale range
from 0 to 16, with higher scores indicating greater impair-
ment [12]. In hospital functional decline was defined as hav-
ing a worse (higher) ADL score on discharge compared to
admission. Those who died in hospital were excluded.
Delirium
As part of the interRAI-AC, varying mental func-
tion and acute changes in mental status from baseline were
evaluated by the nurse assessors at admission and discharge.
The two items were combined to screen for delirium. This
screener has been validated in a prospective observational
study with good positive predictive value (PPV) of delirium
[21]. Delirium in hospital was recorded if the interRAI
delirium screen was positive at the admission or discharge
assessments or if delirium and/or any acute change in cog-
nitive function was noted in the hospital records on daily
ward visits by the nurse assessor.
Pressure ulcer incidence
As previously described [22], new
cases of pressure ulcer were assessed by the research nurse
who visited the wards daily and viewed medical charts to
record AEs including onset of any pressure ulcer that
developed during the AC stay. Those with pressure ulcer
present at admission were excluded.
Readmissions or deaths within 28 days
Patients were followed
up at 28 days post discharge from AC by telephone and/or
viewing medical records to determine if the patient had
been readmitted to hospital or died during that period.
Composite AE in hospital
This included inpatient fall, delir-
ium or pressure ulcer.
Composite adverse outcome
Patients discharged to a RAC facil-
ity or who died in hospital or within 28 days post discharge
were combined in this category.
Analysis
Frequency distributions were used to describe cohort char-
acteristics. Percentages are given as the proportion of avail-
able data. To investigate the predictive ability of the FI-AC
on various AEs, we performed ordinal regression for dis-
charge outcome and logistic regression between each of the
other AE and FI-AC adjusting for age and gender. We cate-
gorised the FI into nine groups such as 0–0.1000,
0.1001–0.2000 and so on in order to compute an odds ratio
(OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of OR. To summar-
ise discrimination we prepared the receiver operating char-
acteristic (ROC) curve and computed the area under the
curve (AUC), also known as c-statistics. The ROC curve is
seen as a better means of assessing a binary logistic regres-
sion model’s ability to accurately classify observations, with
AUC values of 0.70 and higher considered acceptable dis-
crimination [23].
For each adverse outcome, the FI cut-point at which
optimal sensitivity and specificity occurred was calculated as
well as PPV and negative predictive value (NPV) related to
this FI score.
Ethics
Ethical approval for secondary analysis of the interRAI
data set was granted from the University of Queensland
medical research ethics committee. The University of
Queensland has access to de-identified clinical and research
data on interRAI-AC assessments held in data repositories
managed by the University of Queensland under a licensing
agreement with the interRAI organisation, Michigan, USA.
Results
In the cohort of 1,418 patients, mean age was 81 (SD 6.8)
years, and 55% were female. Prior to admission, 85% were liv-
ing independently in the community and median length of stay
in AC was 7 days (interquartile range 4–11 days). Principal
diagnoses (ICD codes) were recorded for 1,411 participants
(99.5% of the sample). Sociodemographic and clinical charac-
teristics of the study population are shown in Table 1.
An FI-AC could be derived for 100% of the cohort and
was normally distributed around a mean (SD) of 0.32
(0.14). In ordinal regression models, those discharged to
the community (n = 917) were the least frail (0.28 ± 0.12),
while those discharged to other inpatient care (n = 237),
RAC (n = 207) or who died (n = 57) were progressively
frailer (0.39 ± 0.13; 0.41 ± 0.13; 0.47 ± 0.16 respectively)
(OR: 1.93 [95% CI:1.77–2.12]).
In logistic regression models, adjusting for age and gen-
der, each increase of 0.1 in FI was significantly associated
with an increased likelihood of each adverse outcome con-
sidered, with the exception of readmissions within 28 days
(Table 2).
For each adverse outcome, the cut-point at which opti-
mal sensitivity and specificity occurred was for an FI >
0.4. At this FI value, the specificity was higher than its sen-
sitivity. The PPV varied from 7% for inpatient pressure
ulcer to 52% for delirium with consistently high NPVs
(88–98%).
Discussion
In this cohort of older inpatients, a FI derived from an
existing assessment system was significantly associated with
multiple adverse outcomes. While frailty was measured
within 24 h of admission to hospital and may have been
impacted by acute illness, our findings confirm the import-
ance of patients’ current status in prognostication. Older,
complex patients are now scattered throughout general
medicine and surgical wards and many doctors feel inad-
equately trained to meet their individual needs [24].
Identification of older patients most vulnerable to AEs is a
critical first step to optimise management and, ultimately,
improve outcomes. The generation of a FI could help all
doctors, not just those with training and expertise in geriat-
ric medicine, to stratify risk status.
While the continuous nature of the FI is one of its
strengths, in this study we were motivated to explore a cut-

 point that might inform decision-making. Our findings are
clinically coherent. The FI of 0.40 lies between the descrip-
tors moderately frail (mean FI = 0.36) and severely frail
(mean FI = 0.43) on the Clinical Frailty Scale [20]. Results
are also consistent with previous studies. In 2305 commu-
nity dwellers >65 years, no one with FI > 0.45 was free of
both disability and co-morbidity [25]. Here, the NPV of
FI > 0.40 was consistently high, indicating that geriatric
syndromes are uncommon in older inpatients who are
more robust. Integrated, multi-component interventions
which address common shared risk factors can significantly
reduce the incidence of geriatric syndromes, including

 falls, delirium and functional decline [26]. Components
include encouraging early mobilisation, optimising nutri-
tion and hydration and providing reorientation and enga-
gement. Whether systematic application of these strategies
can reduce adverse outcomes for frail older people on
non-geriatric wards is a focus of current studies by our
group [27].
The links between baseline frailty and both delirium
[28–30] and falls [30] in older inpatients have previously
been recognised. This is congruent with the conceptualisa-
tion of a frail older person as a complex system on the
threshold of failure. When redundancy has been lost, even
minor triggers can result in perturbations of higher order
functions such as divided thinking or upright ambulation
[1, 31]. On the other hand, we found no association
between frailty status and readmission to hospital. Again,
this is consistent with previous studies [4]. Readmissions to
the acute sector are notoriously difficult to predict [32] but
medical instability and socio-environmental vulnerability
[33] seem to be key contributors, neither of which is cap-
tured by current single-point frailty measures. Incorporation
of assets, such as the presence of a supportive care-giver
and affluence, may improve prediction of this outcome.
Neighbourhood deprivation, for example, can be reflected
in patients’ residential postcodes [34] which are already rou-
tinely included in electronic admission documentation. The
identification of patients most at risk could trigger imple-
mentation of interventions proven to be effective at redu-
cing hospital readmissions, such as follow-up phone calls
and home visits [35].
This study has certain strengths. The study population is
a large cohort of patients recruited from secondary and ter-
tiary care settings with detailed assessment of patients’ func-
tional
and
cognitive
status.
Data
collection
was
comprehensive and complete with less than 2% missing
data in the final analysis models. We also acknowledge
methodological weaknesses. The instrument used, the
interRAI-AC, does not yet have widespread international
uptake. Yet, it does have more uptake than any other omni-
bus assessment system. The derivation of an FI-AC from
this instrument does not depend on the further collection
of data. Importantly, it can be calculated for even bed-
bound and dependent older people, as exemplified by the
100% completion in this cohort.
Electronic medical records have considerable potential
to individualise patient care [36]. For example, they have
already been used to improve the risk stratification of
patients
presenting
with
suicidal
behaviour
[37].
Comparison of the eFI derived from community-based
assessment [8] to the FI at admission to hospital could
track health across care settings, providing a frailty trajec-
tory which may be more critical to prognosis than either
measure in isolation [38]. The identification of high-risk
patients would enable us to move forward with the next
step, of whether knowing such information with precision
can aid the clinical judgement now employed daily to pro-
ceed with usual care, or to modify it based on the
vulnerability of the person to whom it is aimed. Whether
such modification will target healthcare resources more
effectively and appropriately, and result in improved out-
comes for older inpatients, should be the focus of future
enquiries.
Key points
• A Frailty Index (FI) derived from the interRAI-AC assess-
ment system (FI-AC) has been shown to predict inpatient
mortality.
• A valid frailty measure should be more than a mortality-
prediction tool.
• This study showed that an increased FI-AC score was sig-
nificantly associated with multiple adverse outcomes.
• Identifying high-risk patients using an FI may aid clinical
judgement to target healthcare more effectively.
