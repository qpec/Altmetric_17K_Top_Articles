Natural medicines are attractive sources of leading compounds that can be used
as interventions for neurodegenerative disorders. The complexity of their chemical
components and undetermined bio-metabolism have greatly hindered both the use of
natural medicines and the identification of their active constituents. Here, we report
a systematic strategy for evaluating the bioactive candidates in natural medicines
used for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We found that Drynaria Rhizome could enhance
memory function and ameliorate AD pathologies in 5XFAD mice. Biochemical analysis
led to the identification of the bio-effective metabolites that are transferred to the
brain, namely, naringenin and its glucuronides. To explore the mechanism of action,
we combined the drug affinity responsive target stability with immunoprecipitation-
liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis, identifying the collapsin response
mediator protein 2 protein as a target of naringenin. Our study indicates that biochemical
analysis coupled with pharmacological methods can be used in the search for new
targets for AD intervention.

INTRODUCTION
The development of drugs from natural medicines is a powerful and promising research track.
Because of the diversity of constituents in herbal medicines, multi-component interactions and
multiple molecular targets must be considered, making it difficult to investigate the signaling
mechanism. In vitro bioassay-guided isolation is one of the typical ways to access active compounds
(Koehn and Carter, 2005) and provides a window into the mechanisms of herbal drugs. However,
this approach does not always detect the actual active compounds because this method ignores the
bio-metabolism of constituents before and after absorption (Wishart, 2016). The BBB permeability
of these metabolites is one of the crucial factors in the development of a medicinal drug for
central nervous system (CNS) diseases. In other words, the application of natural medicines to
the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is largely hindered by the limited knowledge of their
metabolism, the effective metabolites and their brain transfer, and the molecular mechanisms
underlying this metabolism. Therefore, addressing which metabolites are delivered to the brain
is at the forefront of research to unravel the true mechanisms of natural medicines.

Discovery of Therapeutic Anti-AD Drug
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis
has been a powerful tool for identifying micro constituents
from the bio-samples obtained after the oral delivery of herbal
drugs (Xiao et al., 2012). Based on LC-TOF/MS analyses, a
few reports have shown selected brain-penetrating metabolites
to be interventions for AD (Wang et al., 2012; Ho et al.,
2013), but their targets and mechanisms were not well clarified.
Our laboratory and others have shown that the drug affinity
responsive target stability (DARTS) method is effective in
identifying the target protein of a ligand (Lomenick et al.,
2009; Tohda et al., 2012). Using this method, we explored the
signaling of several small molecules (Tohda et al., 2012; Shigyo
et al., 2015). In the present study, we established a series of
procedures to investigate which proteins bind to the compounds
and confirm the interaction using LC-MS and DARTS analyses to
identify brain-active compounds after the oral administration of
a drug.
Here, we construct a systematic strategy to unravel the
mechanisms of action of the natural medicines used for AD
treatment by exploring the brain-penetrating metabolites and
their target proteins as a starting point. Briefly, the steps include
(1) screening of effective natural medicines that may enhance
axonal elongation and recover memory function using in vitro
and in vivo models, which have been established previously
(Tohda et al., 2004; Kuboyama et al., 2005); (2) systematically
exploring effective metabolites delivered to the brain using
chemical and pharmacological analyses; (3) identification of the
target proteins as an initial point in identifying the signaling
axis of effective metabolites; and (4) clarification of the specific
signaling pathway driven by those identified metabolites. In this
study, using DR as an example, we first found that DR was
able to recover memory deficits in a murine AD model. By
performing a systematic approach utilizing LTQ Orbitrap Fourier
Transform Mass Spectrometry (LTQ-Orbitrap-FT-MS/MS), we
identified real active metabolites that were distributed in the
brain after the oral administration of DR. Furthermore, the
target of the active metabolites was identified by a combination
of DARTS and LTQ-Orbitrap-FT-MS/MS. We are the first to
identify the effective form of DR and its mechanism for AD
treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal Studies
All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the
Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the
Sugitani Campus of the University of Toyama. All protocols were
approved by the Committee for Animal Care and Use of the
Sugitani Campus of the University of Toyama. The approval
number for the animal experiments is A2014INM-1, and the
confirmation number for the recombinant gene experiments is
G2013INM-1.
Transgenic mice (5XFAD) were obtained from Jackson
Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, United States). They were
maintained as double hemizygotes by crossing with B6/SJL F1
breeders. To test the effect of the DR extract on 5XFAD mice,
we used 5XFAD mice (male and female, 6–
8 months old)
and non-transgenic wild-type littermate mice (male and female,
6–
8 months old). To investigate the effect of naringenin on
5XFAD mice, we used 5XFAD mice (male, 8–
12 months old) and
non-transgenic wild-type littermate mice (male, 8–
12 months
old). All mice were housed with free access to food and water and
were kept in a controlled environment (25 ± 2◦C, 12-h light/dark
cycle starting at 7:00 am).
Behavioral Test
The DR extract was prepared as described previously (Yang et al.,
2015). The DR extract was dissolved in saline to concentrations
of 0.5, 5, and 50 mg ml−1. The DR extract or vehicle solution
(saline) was orally administered once per day for 31 days. On day
20 of DR administration, mice were individually habituated to an
open-field box composed of polyvinyl chloride (33 cm × 28 cm;
height, 26.5 cm) for 10 min. Their paths were tracked using
a digital camera system. The distance moved for 10 min was
considered the locomotor activity and was analyzed with Etho
Vision 3.0 (Noldus, Wageningen, Netherlands). At days 21, 25,
and 31, the object recognition test (ORT), object location test
(OLT), and episodic-like memory test (ELM) were performed
as described previously (Kuboyama et al., 2015). Naringenin
(Sigma–
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) was suspended in
saline to a concentration of 0.5 or 10 mg ml−1 and was orally
administered once per day for 31 days. On days 21, 22, and 29 of
naringenin administration, the open-field locomotion test, ORT,
and OLT were performed.
Immunohistochemistry
After the behavioral studies, mice were deeply anesthetized
with chloral hydrate (Wako, Tokyo, Japan) and perfused with
saline followed by ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde. Dissected
brains were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at
4◦C, immersed in 30% sucrose for 48 h for cryoprotection,
and stored at −30◦C. The brains were cut into 20 µm
coronal slices (six slices of each mouse brain) every 100 µm
in the perirhinal cortex area (bregma −1.46 to −2.06 mm)
using a cryostat (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany). The slices were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with a polyclonal
antibody against Aβ(1–
40/42) (1:300) (Chemicon, Temecula,
CA, United States, cat # AB5076), a monoclonal antibody
against pNF-H (1:300) (Covance, Emeryville, CA, United States,
cat # SMI-35R), and a monoclonal antibody against PHF-tau
(1:100) (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, United States, cat
# MN1020) at 4◦C for 24 h. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:300) and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated
goat anti-mouse antibody (1:300) were used as secondary
antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, United States, cat
# ab150077 and ab150116, respectively). Fluorescence images
of axons, PHF-tau and Aβ(1–
40/42) were captured using a
fluorescent microscope (BX-61/DP70, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan)
at 324 mm × 430 mm. Six successive slices from the perirhinal
cortex containing the hippocampus (CA1, CA3, and DG) of
each mouse were captured for quantification. The images were
analyzed with ImageJ (NIH) as described previously (Tohda et al.,
2012).

Discovery of Therapeutic Anti-AD Drug
Bioavailability, Metabolism, and Brain
Penetration of DR Extract
The DR water extract was re-dissolved in H2O to a concentration
of 10 mg ml−1 and filtered with a 0.45 µm membrane; a 10 µl
sample was used for LC-MS analysis. To explore the metabolites
that penetrated the brain, DR or vehicle solution (saline) was
orally administered to 5XFAD mice (male and female, n = 3) at
a concentration of 13 g kg−1 for a single dose. Thirty minutes
and 5 h after drug administration, mice were euthanized and
blood was collected. The plasma was obtained after centrifugation
of blood at 11,000 g for 10 min at 4◦C. The brain cortex
was dissected following perfusion with saline. Plasma (200 µl)
was extracted with methanol, dried, and resolubilized in 50 µl
methanol. The brain cortex was homogenized and extracted
with methanol, dried, and resolubilized in water (containing
0.1% formic acid) before loading onto preactivated Sep-Pak
C18 SPE cartridges (Waters). The metabolites were eluted with
methanol, vacuum dried, sonicated, and resolubilized in mobile
phase before LC-MS analysis. To calculate the concentration
of metabolites in the brain, the standard curve was made.
Simply, the standard compounds were mixed with blank cortex
and extracted as the method above, and then were applied to
LC-MS analyses. A Thermo ScientificTM Accela HPLC system
interfaced with an LTQ Orbitrap XL hybrid Fourier Transform
Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Co., San Jose, CA, United
States) was used to chemically profile DR and the biosamples.
Liquid chromatographic analysis was performed on a Capcell
Pak C18 MGIII S-5 (1.5 mm i.d. × 150 mm, Shiseido, Tokyo,
Japan) column held at 40◦C with a flow rate of 200 µl/min.
In the mobile phase, 0.1% aqueous formic acid (v/v) (A) and
acetonitrile (B) were used. The following linear elution gradient
was used: 0–
5 min, 6–
20% B; 5–
10 min, 20–
30% B; 10–
25 min,
30–
70% B; 25–
26 min, 70–
6% B; 26–
32 min, 6% B. The following
ESI parameters were used: spray voltage 4.5 kV, capillary voltage
40.0 kV, tube lens 150 V, capillary temperature 330◦C, sheath gas
flow rate 50 units, and aux gas flow rate 10 units. We operated the
mass spectrometer in the positive ESI mode, scanning from 50
to 2,000 m/z, and calibrated the instrument using a polytyrosine
solution before each experiment.
Primary Cultures and Measurement of
Axonal Density
Embryos were removed from a pregnant ddY mouse (SLC,
Shizuoka, Japan) at 14 days of gestation as described previously
(Tohda et al., 2012). The cells were treated with 10 µM Aβ25−35
or 5 µM Aβ1−42 (Sigma–
Aldrich, A4559 or A9810) for 3 days
before being treated with naringenin or vehicle (0.1% DMSO)
for 4 days. The Aβ25−35 or Aβ1−42 was previously incubated
at 37◦C for 4 or 7 days for aggregation, respectively. The cells
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and immunostained at
4◦C for 24 h with a monoclonal antibody against pNF-H (1:500)
as an axonal marker and a polyclonal antibody against MAP2
(1:2000, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom, cat # ab32454) as
a neuronal marker. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit
IgG (1:200) and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse
IgG (1:200) were used as secondary antibodies. Fluorescence
images were captured using a fluorescence microscope system
(BX61/DP70, Olympus) at 644 µm × 855 µm. The lengths of
the pNF-H-positive axons were measured using a MetaMorph
analyser (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, United States).
DARTS Analysis
A mouse brain cortex was homogenized with M-PER (Thermo
Scientific) containing 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo
Scientific). The brain lysate (2.7 mg each) was added to 60 µl
of 6 mg ml−1 DR extract or vehicle solution and incubated
for 60 min at room temperature. The mixture was proteolysed
using 2.7 mg thermolysin (Sigma) in reaction buffer [50 mM
Tris–
HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2] for 30 min
at 37◦C. To stop the proteolysis, 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0) was
added to each sample in a 1:10 ratio. The samples (600 µg
each) were then analyzed using 2D-PAGE. The separated proteins
were stained using the colloidal Coomassie method. The spots
that were thicker in the DR-treated lysate than the vehicle-
treated lysate were cut out and prepared for mass spectrometry
analysis. Protein spots were excised, digested with trypsin
(Promega, Madison, WI, United States), mixed with α-cyano-
4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA, and
subjected to MALDI-TOF analysis (Microflex LRF 20, Bruker
Daltonics). DARTS and western blot analysis were performed
to confirm the collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2)
protein as a target of naringenin. A primary culture of mouse
cortical neurons (ddY, E14) was maintained for 72 h without
drug treatment. The cells were lysed, and cell lysate (15 µg each)
was added to 1.67 ml of 10 mM naringenin in vehicle solution
and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. The mixture
was proteolysed using 3.75 ng thermolysin in reaction buffer
for 15 min at 37◦C. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.5
M EDTA (pH 8.0) to each sample at a 1:10 ratio. The samples
were then subjected to SDS–
PAGE for western blot analysis.
Anti-CRMP2 (1:3000) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, United States, cat
# C2993) and anti-β-actin (1:1000) (Cell Signaling Technology,
cat # 4967) antibodies were used as the primary antibodies,
and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000) (Santa Cruz,
CA, United States, cat # sc-2004) was used as the secondary
antibody.
IP Coupled with LC-MS Analysis
Mouse primary cortical neurons (E14) were cultured for 3 days
before 100 µM naringenin was added for 0.5, 2, or 6 h. After
being washed three times with 1× PBS, neuronal cells were lysed
with M-PER solution. Thirty micrograms of protein from each
sample was denatured and extracted with 100 µl methanol, and
the supernatant was subjected to LC-MS after centrifugation
at 14,000 g for 10 min. For immunoprecipitation (IP), the
lysates (30 µg) treated with naringenin for 6 h were incubated
with antibody (CRMP2 or IgG, 3.5 µg) for 1 h before being
incubated with protein G dynabeads (Life Technologies) for
10 min at 4◦C. The beads were washed three times with PBS
containing 0.02% Tween 20 and then extracted with methanol.
The supernatant was applied to LC-MS after centrifugation for
10 min at 14,000 g. The LC-MS conditions were the same as those
in the aforementioned experiment except for the linear elution

siRNA Knockdown
siRNAs were transfected into mouse cortical neurons (ddY
E14) together with GFP vectors according to the manufacturer’
s
protocol for nucleofection (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). Briefly,
mouse cortical neurons (5.0 × 106 cells) were mixed with
siCRMP2 (1 µM, Thermo Scientific, cat # 4390771) or control
siRNA (1 µM, Thermo Scientific, 4390843) and GFP vector
(2 µg, Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) and electroporated with an
Amaxa Nucleofector (Lonza). Three days after the transfection,
cells were fixed and immunostained with a polyclonal antibody
against CRMP2 (Sigma, cat # C2993). Double immunostained
neurons were selected for statistical analysis. The appropriate
concentration
of
siRNA
for
knockdown
was
determined
previously. Three days after the transfection of siRNA, the
cells were treated with naringenin (10 µM) or vehicle solution
(0.1% DMSO). Four days after treatment, the axon density was
measured.
In Vitro Evaluation of Phosphorylated
CRMP2
Mouse primary cortical neurons (E14) were cultured for 3 days
and then treated with 10 µM Aβ25−35 for another 3 days. After
removal of the Aβ-containing medium, the cells were treated
with naringenin (1 µM) for 0.5, 24, or 96 h. Cells were fixed
and double immunostained with a polyclonal antibody against
pThr514 CRMP2 (1:200) (Cell Signaling Technology, cat # 9397)
and a monoclonal antibody against MAP2a/2b (1:200, Fremont,
CA, United States, cat # MS-249-S) as a neuron marker. The
expression of pCRMP2 was measured using a CS Analyzer
(ATTO, Tokyo, Japan).
Statistical Analysis
Graphs were generated with GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA, United States), and Student’
s unpaired
t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett’
s
post hoc test and two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc
test were performed for statistical analysis of the data, and the
statistical significance criterion P-value was 0.05. The data are
presented as the mean ± SEM.
RESULTS
DR Extract Ameliorates Memory Deficits
in the 5XFAD Mouse Model
DR extracts (5, 50, or 500 mg kg−1 per day) or vehicle solutions
were orally administered to 5XFAD mice. The determination of
DR doses was according to the animal study of other groups
(Anuja et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2014). The memory test scheme
was showed in Figure 1A. In the object recognition memory
test (Figure 1C), all of the mice showed equivalent exploratory
behavior toward each of the objects (preference indices were
approximately 50%) in the training session. In the test session,
wild-type mice and DR (50 and 500 mg kg−1 per day)-treated
5XFAD mice exhibited significantly more frequent exploratory
behavior toward a novel object than vehicle-treated 5XFAD mice
(approximately 50%). Improvement of recognition memory by
DR (500 mg kg−1 per day) was confirmed by other independent
experiments, too (Supplementary Figures 1A,B).
To test whether spatial memory is improved by DR, we
performed the object location memory test (Figure 1D); in this
test, in which one of the novel objects was located in a different
place in the test session, the vehicle-treated 5XFAD mice could
not distinguish the object with the novel location from the
object with the familiar location, whereas wild-type mice and
DR (500 mg kg−1 per day)-treated 5XFAD mice significantly
increased their exploratory behavior toward the object in the
novel location. The ELM was carried out to evaluate the ability
of the mice to integrate object (what), location (where), and
context recognition (when) (Dere et al., 2005). In this test,
among the four objects in the test session, E1 and E4 were
located at the same places in training session 2, while the
objects D2 and D4’had been presented to mice in training
session 1 (Figure 1E(1)). Therefore, objects D2 and D4’were
more unfamiliar than objects E1 and E4 in the test session.
Wild-type mice and DR (50 and 500 mg kg−1 per day)-treated
5XFAD mice significantly increased their exploratory behavior
toward the unfamiliar objects (D2 and D4’
) compared with the
familiar objects (E1 and E4) (Figure 1E(2)). The vehicle-treated
5XFAD mice failed to distinguish between the presented objects.
For objects D2 and D4’
, D2 was presented to mice at the same
location in training session 1. D4’
was located at a novel place for
the mice; therefore, if the mouse memorized object places and
presentation orders, the mouse would show higher preference
indices for object D4’
than D2. Like the vehicle-treated 5XFAD
mice, the wild-type mice failed to recognize objects D2 and
D4’
; in contrast, DR (500 mg kg−1 per day)-treated 5XFAD
mice significantly increased their exploratory behavior toward
object D4’
rather than D2 (Figure 1E(3)), this might due to the
memory improvement of DR on normal mice (Supplementary
Figures 2A–
C). The animals’
body weights were recorded during
the drug administration, with no significant changes observed in
any of the groups (Supplementary Figure 2D). In the open-field
test, no significant locomotor differences were detected in the
distances moved and velocity among the five groups (Figure 1B
and Supplementary Figure 2E).
Collectively, these results indicate that DR extract rescues
cognitive deficits when orally administered to 5XFAD transgenic
mice.
DR Extract Ameliorates AD-Like
Pathology in 5XFAD Mice
All of the aforementioned wild-type mice and 5XFAD mice
were euthanized after the behavior tests. To examine the effect
of orally administered DR on the number of Aβ plaques, the
brains of mice were sectioned and stained for Aβ1−42 to visualize
Aβ plaques. We measured Aβ plaques in the perirhinal cortex
and hippocampus of the brain. Amyloid deposits were primarily
localized in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of 5XFAD mice,

Discovery of Therapeutic Anti-AD Drug
FIGURE 2 | DR extract ameliorates AD-like pathology in 5XFAD mice. DR extract (5, 50, 500 mg kg−1, p.o.) or vehicle solution (saline) was administered to wild-type
or 5XFAD mice (males and females, 6–8 months old) for 31 days. The day after the behavioral test, mice were sacrificed and subjected to brain analysis.

the cerebral cortex and hippocampus are shown. One-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s post hoc test were used for all statistical analyses (∗p < 0.05 vs. veh/5XFAD; the
number of measured areas is shown in each column).
while no Aβ deposits were observed in the age-matched wild-type
mice (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure 2F). DR treatment
dose-dependently reduced Aβ plaques in the cortex of 5XFAD
mice and diminished Aβ plaques in the hippocampus at the
500 mg kg−1 per day dose (Figure 2B).
To assess the level of paired helical filament (PHF)-tau,
another key neuropathological feature in AD, we stained the
brain slices with an anti-phosphorylated tau antibody. PHF-tau
was observed very close to the Aβ plaques (Figure 2A) in 5XFAD
mice, while no PHF-tau was observed in the wild-type mice.
DR dose-dependently decreased the levels of PHF-tau in the
cortex, and a decreasing trend in PHF-tau was observed in the
hippocampus after DR treatment (Figure 2C).
As DR stimulated axonal outgrowth after Aβ25−35-induced
atrophy in cultured primary cortical neurons (Yang et al., 2015),
we investigated whether any changes were induced by DR
treatment in 5XFAD mice. Abnormal axon structures, such as
bulb- or ring-like neurofilaments stained with pNF-H, are located
within amyloid plaques in both preclinical and end-stage AD
patients (Dickson and Vickers, 2001). Our previous study also
indicated that bulb-shaped axons are colocalized with amyloid
plaques in 5XFAD mice (Tohda et al., 2012). The axons in
the vehicle-treated 5XFAD mice were blocked at the front of
amyloid plaques and formed swollen bulb- or ring-like shapes
(Figure 2D). Abnormal axons were rarely detected in the distal
part of amyloid plaques. DR (500 mg kg−1 per day) treatment
significantly reduced the swollen axonal areas in the brain cortex
and hippocampus (Figure 2E). Collectively, these results indicate
that orally administered DR effectively repairs degenerated axons
in the brains of 5XFAD mice, which might contribute to the
recovery of memory function.
DR-Derived Metabolites Penetrate the
BBB after the Oral Administration of DR
Extracts to 5XFAD Mice
To clarify the mechanism through which DR may function in
treating AD, we tried to detect DR-derived metabolites that are
delivered into the brain. Using the high-accuracy quasi-molecular
ion ([M+H]+) and a mass error of ±1 mmu, we comprehensively
characterized 17 compounds by comparing their MS-MS data
and fragmentation patterns with those of reference standards
or reported compounds (Supplementary Figure 3 and Table 1).
Naringin and neoeriocitrin are the two main compounds in DR
extract, with contents of 96.8 and 108.0 mg g−1, respectively.

with methanol and subjected to LC-MS analysis. (A) Extracted ion current (EIC) chromatograms of naringenin glucuronide (m/z = 449.1065) and naringenin

and naringenin glucuronide are metabolized from naringin and
were detected in the plasma of rats after the oral administration
of naringin (Fang et al., 2006). Then, we profiled the chemicals
that were delivered into the blood and brain in 5XFAD mice
with HPLC-FT-MS. Usually higher doses than effective doses are
selected to detect the metabolites of herbal extracts (Xiang et al.,
2011), formulations (Fujiwara et al., 2011; Kushida et al., 2013),
and even single compounds (Durairajan et al., 2012; Tan et al.,
2013) in biosamples. Therefore, we orally administered a high
dose of DR (13 g kg−1) to the 5XFAD mice. Using SIEVE software
(Niu et al., 2015), we performed differential analyses of the
total ion current (TIC) chromatograms for the biosamples from
vehicle-treated and DR-treated mice (Supplementary Figure 4).
The different TIC peaks were analyzed and considered based
on their retention times, accurate mass values, and MS-MS
fragment patterns. Thirteen compounds or metabolites were
detected in the plasma of DR-treated 5XFAD mice, and 3
chemicals were detected in the brain cortex of DR-treated 5XFAD
mice (Supplementary Table 1). The extracted ion current (EIC)
chromatograms of the speculated brain-delivered metabolites
are shown in Figure 3A. These metabolites were detected in
the brains 5 h after administration of DR (Figure 3A(3))
but not detected in the brains of vehicle-treated 5XFAD mice
(Figure 3A(1)) or 30 min after the oral administration of
DR extract (Figure 3A(2)). To confirm the structures of
the speculated metabolites, we synthesized naringenin-7-O-
glucuronide and naringenin-4�-O-glucuronide from naringenin
and analyzed the mass fragmentation characteristics of these
compounds (Figure 3B). The HPLC-MS results showed similar
retention time and MS-MS fragmentations in the standards
and DR-treated mouse brain samples (Figure 3C). Our pre-
experiment showed that the Cmax of metabolites was 5 h after DR
administration. Using the standard curve, the calculated levels of
naringenin, naringenin-7-O-glucuronide, and naringenin-4�-O-
glucuronide metabolite in the brain are 15.1 ± 2.9, 302.6 ± 77.9,
and 22.7 ± 17.8 pmol g−1 following DR treatment, respectively.
Taken together, these results suggest that the metabolites
naringenin and glucuronides of naringenin at the 4� or 7 position
can penetrate the BBB after the oral administration of DR
extract.
DR-Derived Brain Penetrating
Metabolites Enhance Axonal Growth in
Cultured Neurons after Aβ Treatment
To test the effects of brain-penetrating metabolites on axonal
growth, we investigated their effects on both Aβ1−42 and
Aβ25−35-induced axonal atrophy in cultured cortical neurons.
According to the bioavailability of DR (13 g kg−1) in vivo,
we calculated the total accumulated naringenin metabolites
in the brain at a concentration of 13.1 nM after DR
(500 mg kg−1) administration. Therefore, we selected the
concentration of metabolites from 10 to 10 µM for the study
in vitro. Axonal density was decreased significantly by Aβ25−35
or Aβ1−42 treatment, whereas treatment with naringenin
(1 µM) and naringenin-7-O-glucuronide (0.1 µM) significantly
increased the length of pNF-H (phosphorylated neurofilament
H, axonal marker)-positive axons (Figures 4A,B). What’

and one of the compounds (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 µM), NGF (100 ng/ml), or vehicle (0.1% DMSO) was added to the neurons. Four days after the treatment, the

naringenin (1 µM) and naringenin-7-O-glucuronide (1 and

(Figure 4B). NGF was used as a positive control for axonal
extension after Aβ25−35 treatment (Kuboyama et al., 2005). This
result indicates that naringenin and naringenin-7-O-glucuronide
can restore Aβ-induced axonal atrophy.
Naringenin Ameliorates Memory Deficits
and AD-Like Pathology in 5XFAD Mice
According to the contents of naringin and naringenin in
DR extract, and naringin could be metabolized to naringenin
in vivo according to our experiment and other reports. We
calculated the total amount of naringenin aglycone in DR
extract. Twenty-three milligram naringenin is contained in
500 mg DR extract. We also referred to the dose of naringenin
in reports of other AD models (Yang et al., 2014; Ghofrani
et al., 2015). We orally administered naringenin (5 and 100 mg
kg−1 per day) to the 5XFAD mice (male, 8–
12 months old)
for 31 days (Figure 5A). In the ORT (Figure 5C), wild-type
mice and naringenin 100 mg kg−1 per day-treated 5XFAD
mice exhibited significantly more frequent exploratory behavior
toward the novel object than vehicle-treated 5XFAD mice. In
the OLT, naringenin 100 mg kg−1 per day-treated 5XFAD
mice showed the trend of increased object location memory
(Supplementary Figure 5B). There were no significant differences
in the distances moved by the four groups in the open-field
test (Figure 5B). During drug administration, the animals’
body weights did not change significantly (Supplementary

mice exhibited a significant reduction in amyloid plaques and
swollen axon expressions (associated with the plaques) in the

the hippocampus (associated with the plaques) was significantly
decreased by naringenin (100 mg kg−1 per day) treatment.
Taken together, the findings revealed that orally administered
naringenin ameliorates memory deficits and effectively decreases
amyloid plaques, plaque-associated PHF-tau and swollen axons
in 5XFAD mice, as shown for DR administration.
Naringenin Targets CRMP2 and Reduces
the Phosphorylation of CRMP2 in
Cultured Primary Neurons
To explore the mechanism responsible for naringenin-induced
axonal growth and memory improvement, we first used the
DARTS method (Lomenick et al., 2009; Pai et al., 2015) to
identify a target protein of naringenin. When a compound
binds to a target protein, the protein conformation is probably
changed, changing the protease sensitivity of the target protein
(Lomenick et al., 2009). Based on our previous study, a 62-
kDa protein spot was thicker in the DR-treated brain lysate
than the vehicle on a 2D-PAGE gel after thermolysin reaction
(Supplementary Figure 6), MALDI-TOF-MS analysis indicated
that the spot was possibly CRMP2. To confirm CRMP2 as a target
protein of naringenin, we performed DARTS and western blot
analyses using cell lysates from mouse primary cultured cortical
neurons (Figure 6A). After thermolysin treatment, the CRMP2
level in naringenin-treated lysates was significantly decreased
compared with the vehicle solution-treated group (Figure 6B and
Supplementary Figure 9).
Next, to confirm the binding of naringenin to CRMP2, we
performed LC-MS combined with IP analysis. First, we evaluated
whether naringenin could be taken up by the neurons. We
found that naringenin accumulated in the neurons in a time-
dependent manner (Supplementary Figures 7A,B). Surprisingly,
naringenin glucuronides were also detected in the neurons
30 min after incubation (Supplementary Figure 7A). Then,
lysates were prepared from neurons after 6 h of incubation with
naringenin and were subjected to IP with a CRMP2 antibody
or normal IgG antibody. Naringenin was detected abundantly

quantified. (F) Naringenin treatment decreased the Aβ-induced phosphorylation of CRMP2. Cortical neurons were cultured for 3 days, treated with Aβ25−35 or

removal of the Aβ-containing medium. The cells were double immunostained for pCRMP2 and MAP2. The level of pCRMP2 in neurons was quantified. (D–F) The
number of neurons is shown in each column. Student’s unpaired t-tests were performed in (D,E) (∗p < 0.05), and one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc test was

after IP with the CRMP2 antibody (peak area: 169,940) but was
rarely detected in the IgG immunoprecipitated sample (peak area:
8,265) (Figure 6C). The single peak detected in the group without
the CRMP2 antibody might be caused by a small amount of
non-specific binding between protein G and the CRMP2 protein
(Supplementary Figure 7C).
To investigate whether CRMP2 mediates naringenin-induced
axonal extension, CRMP2 was knocked down using siRNA
transfection. Three days after the transfection of siRNA targeting
CRMP2 (1 µM), the CRMP2 level in the GFP-transfected
neurons was significantly reduced (44%) compared with the
control siRNA-transfected neurons (Figure 6D, Right). There
were no changes in the measured cell body area (Figure 6D,
Left). In control siRNA-transfected neurons, the axon density
was significantly increased by naringenin treatment (Figure 6E).
However, the naringenin-induced axonal growth was completely
abolished by transfection of CRMP2 siRNA (Figure 6E). These
data indicate that CRMP2 is a target of naringenin and is essential
for naringenin-induced axonal growth.
CRMP2 is critical for the regulation of neurite outgrowth
due to its binding to tubulin heterodimers (Fukata et al., 2002).

et al., 2009; Isono et al., 2013). CRMP2 is phosphorylated
by Cdk5 at Ser522 and subsequently phosphorylated by GSK-
3β at Ser518, Thr514, and Thr509 (Uchida et al., 2005).
Therefore, we investigated the effect of naringenin on the
expression of pThr514-CRMP2 in Aβ-treated primary cultured
cortical neurons. Compared with the control group, CRMP2
was hyperphosphorylated at Thr514 after Aβ25−35 treatment; the
pCRMP2 level decreased significantly after naringenin treatment
(Figure 6F).
Collectively, our findings revealed that naringenin binds
to CRMP2 and reduces the Aβ-induced phosphorylation of
CRMP2, resulting in axonal growth facilitation.
DISCUSSION
Generally speaking, it is challenging and time-consuming to
isolate, identify, and screen the bioactive components in natural
medicines. In addition, the components may be metabolized to
phase I and II derivatives following absorption. Therefore, the
bioavailability and access of metabolites or natural components
to brain tissues are absolutely critical factors in predicting the
potential for those compounds as CNS drugs. Thus, studies
investigating the bioactivity and physiological mechanisms of
natural medicines must use the metabolites that have been
identified in the target tissues. Here, we report a new strategy
that couples biochemical analysis with pharmacological methods
and can be used to evaluate therapeutic candidates for AD
in natural medicines. Using this method, we found that a
crude drug, DR, ameliorated memory deficits and AD-like
pathologies in 5XFAD model mice. To clarify the mechanism
of action for DR in the treatment of AD, we first identified
metabolites that were delivered into the brain. To detect
enough concentration and a variety of metabolites as possible
as we can, we administered a single dose of DR (13 g
kg−1) to the mice. As a result, only 3 metabolites were
identified in the brain cortex with comprehensive FT-MS-MS
analysis.
Previously, we identified five main compounds in the water
extract of DR using bioassay-guided isolation, with two of
them (neoeriocitrin and caffeic acid-4-O-glucoside) showing
significant axonal elongation effects after Aβ25−35-induced
atrophy (Yang et al., 2015). In the present study, these two
compounds were detected in the blood but not in the brain
after the oral administration of DR (Supplementary Table 1),
demonstrating that they could not penetrate the BBB and enter
into the brain. Naringin did not show axonal regrowth activity
and was not detected in the brain. Nonetheless, two metabolites of
naringin—naringenin and naringenin-7-O-glucuronide—were
found in the brain after the oral administration of DR, and
these metabolites reversed Aβ-induced axonal atrophy. Here, we
directly identified the metabolites delivered into the brain after
an oral dose of a crude extract. Therefore, this method avoids
the identification of false-positive compounds that occurs with
standard bioassay-guided isolation methods and may be a fast,
economical, and efficient way to identify effective metabolites for
use as interventions for AD.
Glucuronidation mediated by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases
(UGTs) is an important metabolic pathway that facilitates the
clearance of xenobiotics, including drugs and environmental
substances, and functions in the metabolism of endogenous
compounds
(Rowland
et
al.,
2013).
These
hydrophilic
glucuronides are generally inactive and show poor BBB
permeability, while some glucuronides, such as morphine-
6-glucuronide and quercetin-3-O-glucuronide, exist in the
brain and show important biological activities (Ho et al.,
2013; Klimas and Mikus, 2014). Our present report also
shows that naringenin-7-O-glucuronide can penetrate the BBB
and enhance axonal regrowth. How do these glucuronides
exist in the brain? One possible explanation is the existence
of a transporter at the BBB. The organic anion transporter
(OAT) is localized at the membrane of BBB cells and is
responsible for the transportation of numerous endogenous
and
xenobiotic
amphipathic
compounds
(Kullak-Ublick
et al., 2001; Sugiyama et al., 2003; Ohtsuki et al., 2004).
Moreover, OAT can actively transport morphine-6-glucuronide
across the BBB (Bourasset et al., 2003). However, there are
no reports regarding a naringenin-glucuronide transporter.
Another explanation is the finding of UGTs in the brain
and neurons. In the brain, UGTs are mainly expressed in
endothelial cells and astrocytes of the BBB (Ouzzine et al.,
2014).
The
expression
of
glucuronosyltransferase
isoform
UGT1A6 was reported in primary cultures of neurons and
astrocytes (Suleman et al., 1998). Our results also provide
evidence that UGTs are present in neurons (Supplementary
Figure 7A). Thus, it is possible that naringenin was absorbed
by neurons and glucuronidated by UGTs after penetrating the
BBB.
Drug affinity responsive target stability has been used for
the identification of ligand targets by identifying the alterations
in proteolytic sensitivity that occur after the binding of ligand
and receptor (Lomenick et al., 2009). Therefore, this method
might be used to identify new targets for the treatment of
AD. Here, we first combined FT-MS-MS with the DARTS
method to discover a brain-penetrating compound, naringenin,
and its target protein CRMP2. Actually, DARTS is based on
the conformation changes after drug binding, resulting in a
decrease or an increase in proteolytic susceptibility of the target
protein (Lomenick et al., 2009). In this study, DR showed
increased band density while naringenin showed decreased band
density of CRMP2 compared with vehicle treated thermolysin
group in DARTS analysis. This might due to non-specifically
binding of DR derived components (except for naringenin)
with CRMP2 in case of DARTS used DR extract, because
the proteolytic susceptibility of CRMP2 might be changed
compared with that of CRMP2 induced by naringenin. Since
naringenin-7-O-glucuronide showed axonal regrowth activity
after Aβ-induced axonal atrophy, it is possible that naringenin-7-
O-glucuronide binds to CRMP2. Thus, we performed the DARTS
experiment of naringenin and its glucuronides using lysed
neurons. The result was shown in Supplementary Figure 8, except
for naringenin, naringenin-7-O-glucuronide but not naringenin-
4�-O-glucuronide also showed the possible binding possibility
to CRMP2. This was corresponding to the in vitro assay result,

which indicated that naringenin-induced cellular signaling was
attributed to naringenin and naringenin-7-O-glucuronide.
Naringenin has been reported to improve learning and
memory in Aβ or streptozotocin-injected AD models (Yang
et al., 2014; Ghofrani et al., 2015), which might relate to
the mitigation of lipid peroxidation and apoptosis or the
increased insulin and insulin receptor expression in the rat
brain. Naringenin also showed anti-inflammatory activity in
LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated glial cells and neuroprotective effects
against H2O2-induced hyper-oxidation (Heo et al., 2004;
Vafeiadou et al., 2009). In the present study, we found that
naringenin enhanced axonal growth in both normal neurons
and neurons subjected to Aβ-induced axonal atrophy. This
growth might contribute to the reconstruction of neural
networks and improvements in memory. With the exception
of lacosamide, which reduced the association between Cdk5-
phosphorylated CRMP2 and CaV2.2 in vitro and in vivo
(Moutal et al., 2016), the binding of small molecules to
CRMP2 has rarely been reported. Moreover, lacosamide inhibited
CRMP2-dependent tubulin polymerization, which prevents the
growth of neurites. The present study is the first to describe
a molecule, naringenin that targets CRMP2 and inhibits
CRMP2 phosphorylation at Thr514. This might restore the
association between CRMP2 and tubulin, leading to axonal
regrowth.
In summary, we first reported that DR enhances memory
function and ameliorates AD pathologies in 5XFAD mice.
LTQ-Orbitrap-FT-MS-MS and DARTS analysis pinpointed the
effective substances in DR and identified a molecule that
binds to CRMP2. This systematic strategy might contribute
to the development of natural medicines and exploration of
their mechanisms. Moreover, this strategy might be broadly
applicable to the identification of novel compounds and targets
for intervention in CNS diseases.
