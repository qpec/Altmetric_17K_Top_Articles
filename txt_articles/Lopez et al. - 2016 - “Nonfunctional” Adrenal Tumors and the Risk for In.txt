Abstract
Background—Adrenal tumors are commonly discovered on abdominal imaging. The majority 
of adrenal tumors are classified as “non-functional” and considered to pose no health risk, whereas 
a minority will be considered “functional” because they secrete hormones that increase risk for 
metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.
Objective—To evaluate the hypothesis that “non-functional” adrenal tumors (NFAT) increase 
risk for developing cardiometabolic outcomes when compared with having no adrenal tumor.
Design—Cohort study.
Setting—Integrated hospital system.
Participants—Exposed participants with benign NFAT (n=242) and unexposed participants with 
no adrenal tumor (n=1237).
Measurements—Medical records were reviewed from the time of abdominal imaging for 
development of incident outcomes (hypertension, composite diabetes [pre-diabetes or type 2 
diabetes], hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular events, chronic kidney disease) (mean 7.7 years). 
Primary analyses evaluated independent associations between exposure status and incident 
outcomes using adjusted generalized linear models. Secondary analyses evaluated relationships 
between NFAT and cortisol physiology.

 Results—NFAT were associated with significantly higher risk for incident composite diabetes 
when compared with no adrenal tumor (adjusted RR=1.87, 95% CI: 1.17, 2.98; absolute risk: 
30/110 vs. 72/615, 15.6%). No significant associations between NFAT and other outcomes were 
observed. Higher “normal” post-dexamethasone cortisol levels (<1.8 mcg/dL) associated with 
larger NFAT size and a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes.
Limitations—Potential bias in the selection of participants and ascertainment of outcomes.
Conclusions—Participants with NFAT had a significantly higher risk of developing diabetes 
when compared to participants without adrenal tumors. These results prompt a re-assessment of 
whether the classification of benign adrenal tumors as “non-functional” adequately reflects the 
continuum of hormone secretion and metabolic risk they may harbor.
INTRODUCTION
The use of cross-sectional abdominal imaging has increased the incidental detection of 
adrenal tumors (1, 2). Imaging and autopsy series estimate that the prevalence of adrenal 
tumors is 1–10% (3–5), with higher occurrences with older age (4, 5). Although nearly all of 
these adrenal findings will represent benign adrenocortical tumors that are “non-functional” 
in that they do not apparently secrete hormones (1, 2, 6), a substantial proportion may be 
“functional” in that they do secrete adrenocortical hormone(s). It is estimated that 
approximately 10% of adrenocortical tumors may secrete excess cortisol without the 
classical signs or symptoms of Cushing syndrome, known as subclinical hypercortisolism (1, 
6–9). Subclinical hypercortisolism has been associated with hypertension, insulin resistance, 
type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, and obesity(10, 11), and recent studies 
suggest that subclinical hypercortisolism may increase the risk of developing incident 
cardiovascular events and mortality when compared to “non-functional” adrenal tumors 
(NFAT)(12–14). Therefore, it is recommended that all patients with adrenal tumors be 
screened for hypercortisolism (1, 2, 15, 16).
However, emerging evidence suggests that even apparent NFAT have a higher cross-
sectional association with cardiometabolic derangements, such as insulin resistance, when 
compared with matched controls without adrenal tumors (17–19), possibly because NFAT 
secrete low-levels of glucocorticoids (17, 20). Although the size of these aforementioned 
studies was small and lacked longitudinal follow-up, collectively they suggest that NFAT, 
defined by our current clinical practice guidelines (1, 2, 15, 16, 21), may not be “non-
functional” after all; they may impart cardiometabolic risk by secreting inappropriate 
amounts of adrenal hormones that evade our traditional clinical criteria and detection 
capabilities.
A better understanding of whether NFAT represent an independent risk factor for 
cardiometabolic disease is of public health importance. We hypothesized that NFAT are 
associated with an increased risk for developing incident diabetes and cardiovascular 
outcomes, when compared with similar patients without adrenal tumors.

 METHODS
Study Population
We retrospectively assembled a cohort to examine the prospective association between 
NFAT and cardiometabolic outcomes. The medical records of patients at Brigham and 
Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital and their affiliated partner hospitals 
who had undergone either abdominal computed tomography or abdominal magnetic 
resonance imaging were evaluated (Figure 1). Detailed methodology for the selection of the 
study participants is presented in the Supplementary Appendix. After excluding participants 
who had a documented diagnosis of any adrenal hormone disorder or malignancy, we 
identified participants who potentially had NFAT (the exposure of interest) (n=941), and 
age-, sex-, and race-matched participants who potentially did not have an adrenal tumor 
(n=1,559) (Figure 1). All study procedures where approved by our Partners Inc. institutional 
research and ethics review board.
Assessment of the Main Exposure: Non-functional Adrenal Tumor
Individual medical record review was used to confirm exposure status (Figure 1). Detailed 
methodology for confirming exposure status is presented in the Supplementary Appendix. 
We excluded participants with an adrenal tumor that did not appear benign on imaging or 
who lacked biochemical evaluation to assess for subclinical hypercortisolism. From the 
remaining participants with adrenal tumors who had assessments for hypercortisolism, we 
excluded those with evidence for potential subclinical or overt hypercortisolism defined as: a 
serum cortisol of >1.8 μg/dl (50 nmol/liter) following a 1 mg dexamethasone suppression 
testing (DST) (21) or a urinary free cortisol (UFC) ≥50 mcg/24h (21). We also excluded 
participants with potential subclinical or overt primary aldosteronism (22) (Supplementary 
Appendix). Following these exclusions, there were 242 participants with NFAT, of which 
subclinical hypercortisolism was excluded by DST in 164/242, by 24h UFC in 104/242, and 
by both DST and UFC in 28/242. Similarly, we used medical record review to confirm 1,237 
unexposed participants who had no adrenal tumors on imaging and no known adrenal 
hormone dysfunction diagnoses (Figure 1).
Assessment of Other Relevant Exposures
Medical record review also collected details on pertinent demographic information (age, sex, 
race, and body mass index [BMI]), prevalent medical diagnoses (hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia, pre-diabetes, type 2 diabetes, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, 
myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, atrial fibrillation, interventional coronary procedure 
[coronary catheterization or coronary artery bypass graft surgery]), smoking history, and use 
of relevant medication classes (anti-hypertensive, anti-diabetes [oral hypoglycemics or 
insulin], and for coronary artery disease and/or hyperlipidemia [aspirin, nitrates, statins, 
fibrates, niacin]).
Assessment of Main Outcome Measures: Incident Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease
The main clinical outcomes of interest were: hypertension, composite diabetes, 
hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular events, and chronic kidney disease. These outcomes were

 assessed at baseline (the time of abdominal imaging to evaluate exposure status) and again 
in follow-up. Follow-up assessment of outcomes was conducted only after ≥ 3 years of 
longitudinal follow-up to ensure sufficient exposure time and opportunity for the reliable 
detection and documentation of clinical diagnoses by healthcare providers (n=166/242 with 
NFAT, n=740/1237 without any adrenal tumor) (Figure 1). Participants with < 3 years of 
available follow-up were not included in our dataset or analysis for incident outcomes. 
Prospective clinical outcomes were assessed at the most current annual or complete clinical 
evaluation. Examples of annual or complete evaluations include: comprehensive primary 
care or general internal medicine visit, cardiology or nephrology or endocrinology 
consultation, and pre-operative anesthesia consultation. Hypertension was defined by 
documented diagnosis. Pre-diabetes was defined by documented diagnosis and/or having a 
hemoglobin A1c value between 5.7–6.5% on ≥ 2 occasions among patients who were not on 
any hypoglycemic agent other than metformin. Type 2 diabetes was defined by documented 
diagnosis and/or having hemoglobin A1c values ≥ 6.5% on ≥ 2 occasions. Since pre-diabetes 
and type 2 diabetes are on a pathophysiologic continuum of insulin resistance, we defined 
“composite diabetes” as either pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes. Hyperlipidemia was defined 
by documented diagnosis and/or low-density lipoprotein ≥ 150 mg/dL. Cardiovascular 
events were a composite of any documented diagnosis of history of myocardial infarction, 
ischemic stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, or a coronary intervention procedure. 
Chronic kidney disease was defined by documented diagnosis.
Statistical analyses
We described demographic and clinical characteristics using the number of counts and 
proportions for categorical variables and mean with standard deviations (SD) for continuous 
variables. Categorical and continuous variables were compared using Fisher’s exact test or 
Chi-squared test, and Student’s t-test, respectively.
We fitted multivariable generalized linear regression models with binomial family and 
logarithmic link function to assess cross-sectional associations between NFAT and the 
prevalence of outcomes at baseline. Model 1 was adjusted for age, BMI, gender, race, and 
smoking status. Model 2 was adjusted for variables in model 1 as well as other clinically 
relevant cardiovascular and metabolic diagnoses (adjustments listed in table footnotes). For 
the above referred models we derived and reported unadjusted and multivariable adjusted 
prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
Primary analyses evaluated the independent relation between exposure status and the 
development of each incident outcome using adjusted generalized linear models with 
Poisson family and link log to derive risk ratios (RR) (incidence) and rate ratios (cumulative 
incidence)(23). Risk and rate ratios were derived for individuals who had ≥ 3 years of 
follow-up and did not have the outcome in question at baseline. We used three multivariable 
models. Models 1 and 2 were as described above. Model 3 included all variables in models 1 
and 2 as well as adjustments for the use of individual medication classes. In secondary 
analyses, we evaluated the association between NFAT size and cortisol levels using linear 
regression.

RESULTS
Study Population and Baseline Metabolic and Cardiovascular Outcomes
Baseline characteristics of the study population are described in Table 1. Participants with 
NFAT were slightly younger, had higher BMI and higher prevalence of pre-diabetes and 
diabetes when compared to those without adrenal tumors. In adjusted regression models, 
NFAT were independently associated with a higher prevalence of baseline composite 
diabetes (Appendix Table 1). This association between NFAT and baseline composite 
diabetes prevalence was present whether subclinical hypercortisolism was excluded using 
DST (adjusted PR=1.62 [1.16, 2.27]; n=164 with NFAT, n=1,237 without adrenal tumors) or 
using 24h UFC (adjusted PR=1.81 [1.13, 3.91]; n=104 with NFAT, n=1,237 without adrenal 
tumors).
“Non-Functional” Adrenal Tumors and Incident Outcomes
The mean duration of follow-up was 7.2 years (SD=3.5, range 3.0–23.1) for participants 
with NFAT and 7.8 years (SD=3.6, range 3.0–22.1) for participants without adrenal tumors. 
Incident composite diabetes was detected in 27.3% of participants with NFAT and 11.7% of 
participants without adrenal tumors (Figure 2A). Participants with NFAT had a significantly 
higher risk for developing composite diabetes when compared to participants without 
adrenal tumors (adjusted RR=1.87 [1.17, 2.98]; absolute risk 15.6% [6.9, 24.3]) (Table 2). 
There were no other significant associations between NFAT and other incident outcomes; 
however, wide confidence intervals preclude firm conclusions (Table 2). Importantly, among 
eligible participants in these analyses for incident composite diabetes, there were no major 
differences in demographic profiles, comorbidities, medication use, duration of follow-up or 
assessment of pertinent laboratories (Table 3).
Sensitivity Analyses for Incident Composite Diabetes
The relationship between NFAT and incident composite diabetes remained stable regardless 
of whether subclinical hypercortisolism was excluded using the 1mg DST (unadjusted 
RR=2.34 [1.43, 3.84]; adjusted RR=1.78 [1.03, 3.08]) or the 24h UFC (unadjusted RR=2.22 
[1.23, 4.01]; adjusted RR=2.10 [1.13, 3.91]) (Figure 2B,C). Since 24h UFC can be less 
sensitive at excluding subclinical hypercortisolism when compared to DST (21), we also 
used a stricter restriction criteria of 24h UFC <35 mcg/24h and observed no material 
difference in the result (adjusted RR=2.40 [1.26, 4.58]).
Higher adiposity may be a confounder of the association between NFAT and incident 
composite diabetes; however, higher adiposity may also represent a consequence of NFAT

 that secrete low-grade glucocorticoids and therefore may be in the causal pathway between 
NFAT and incident diabetes. Considering the potential for confounding by higher adiposity, 
we repeated our analysis for incident composite diabetes after adjusting for the change in 
BMI over time since weight gain may be an important risk factor for developing diabetes. 
We observed a stable adjusted RR of 2.05 (1.29, 3.27). Further, we repeated our analysis for 
incident composite diabetes after restricting the eligible participants to only those with 
BMI<30 kg/m2 such that the mean BMI for participants with NFAT was 25.0 (3.4) and the 
mean BMI for participants without adrenal tumors was 24.5 (3.1). There were no other 
notable differences in demographic or comorbid factors between exposure groups after 
restricting BMI to <30 kg/m2, and the adjusted RR for incident composite diabetes remained 
significant at 2.44 (1.17, 5.08).
Exploratory Analyses Including Subclinical Hypercortisolism
We explored whether there was a continuum of risk for incident composite diabetes when 
including participants with subclinical hypercortisolism. Of the 89 participants with adrenal 
tumors that we had excluded for adrenal hormone excess, 35 were excluded for subclinical 
hypercortisolism, and of these only 25 were eligible for analyses of incident composite 
diabetes (≥3 years of follow-up and no diabetes at baseline). Subclinical hypercortisolism 
was defined by DST in 21/25 with a mean post-dexamethasone cortisol of 2.8 (0.8) mcg/dL 
and by 24h UFC in 4/25 with a mean 24h UFC of 72.8 (19.3) mcg. During a mean follow-up 
of 7.9 (3.2) years, 32.0% of participants with subclinical hypercortisolism developed 
incident composite diabetes (Figure 2D).
Size of NFAT, Cortisol Levels, and Outcomes
In secondary analyses, larger NFAT size was associated with higher “normal” serum cortisol 
levels following dexamethasone (β=0.02, P<0.0001) and higher “normal” 24h urinary free 
cortisol levels (β=0.48, P<0.0001) (Figure 3A & 3B). Both relationships remained 
significant following adjustments for age, gender, race, BMI, smoking status, and prevalent 
hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular events, and chronic kidney disease. 
The prevalence of type 2 diabetes was higher with higher post-dexamethasone cortisol 
values (Figure 3C).
There was no significant association between the size of NFAT, or the degree of cortisol 
suppression following dexamethasone, with the incidence of composite diabetes or other 
outcomes; however, the number of incident cases in these analyses was small, thus limiting a 
robust analysis.
DISCUSSION
Adrenal tumors are discovered on 1–10% of abdominal imaging studies (1–5). There were 
>200 million computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies worldwide in 
2013, suggesting that the magnitude of the global prevalence of incidentally discovered 
adrenal tumors could be very high (24). Despite this high prevalence, adrenal tumors are 
often not given dedicated recognition or are lost to clinical follow-up (25), either because 
many health-care providers do not understand the importance of screening for adrenal

 hormone excess, and/or because they were considered unimportant at a time when another 
non-adrenal issue was the focus. Biochemical assessment of adrenal tumors is relevant 
because they may be “functional” in that they autonomously secrete hormones that cause 
overt or subclinical hormone excess and increase the risk for cardiovascular and/or 
metabolic outcomes. However, most adrenal tumors are ultimately determined to be “non-
functional,” and therefore considered to pose no health risk (12, 14). The findings from our 
current investigation substantially extend and potentially redefine the current paradigm of a 
“non-functional” adrenal tumor: we observed that individuals with apparent NFAT, as 
defined by current clinical guidelines, had approximately 2-fold higher risk of developing 
incident diabetes when compared with participants without adrenal tumors. Further, our 
results indicate that a potential mechanism underlying this increased risk for diabetes may be 
glucocorticoid excess within a range that is currently considered “normal” by our accepted 
standards. In this regard, our findings suggest that “non-functional” adrenal tumors may not 
be non-functional after all; rather, they may secrete small and inappropriate amounts of 
glucocorticoids that increase the risk for metabolic disease over time.
Prior longitudinal studies by Di Dalmazi et al.(13), Debono et al.(12), and Morelli et al.(14) 
have described associations between adrenal tumors with subclinical hypercortisolism and 
incident cardiovascular events (14) and mortality(12, 13). These three studies used the NFAT 
group as the referent control, and did not include comparisons with individuals without 
adrenal tumors. Whether the higher risk of cardiovascular events and mortality associated 
with hypercortisolism in these studies was mediated by the development of incident insulin 
resistance or diabetes, a major risk factor for death (26), was not directly evaluated. In 
contrast, our study was designed to focus only on NFAT in comparison to no adrenal tumors; 
however, we were also able to conduct an exploratory analysis that included a small 
population of participants with subclinical hypercortisolism that suggested a continuum of 
risk across these classifications. Collectively, our studies (12–14) suggest a “continuum of 
metabolic and cardiovascular risk:” prevalent NFAT may impart an increased risk of 
developing insulin resistance and diabetes when compared to individuals without adrenal 
tumors, and the addition of subclinical hypercortisolism may further increase the risk of 
developing cardiovascular events and death, which are dramatically increased in the rare 
instance of overt Cushing syndrome (27, 28) (Appendix Figure 1). In contrast to the studies 
by Di Dalmazi and Morelli, we did not have measures of adrenocorticotropic hormone 
(ACTH) since our study was observational and ACTH measures in patients with NFAT and 
without adrenal tumors are rarely performed. These prior studies reported that ACTH levels 
were detectable and slightly higher in NFAT when compared to subclinical hypercortisolism 
(13, 14); therefore, the demonstration that ACTH levels are slightly higher in participants 
with no adrenal tumors when compared to NFAT could have further supported a continuum 
of glucocorticoid excess to parallel the risk for incident diabetes we observed.
Some small cross-sectional studies have suggested a potential link between NFAT and 
cardiometabolic diseases (10, 17–19). Androulakis et al. showed that individuals with NFAT 
had greater insulin resistance indices and endothelial dysfunction when compared with 
healthy controls without adrenal tumors (17). Further, they observed associations between 
higher carotid intima-media thickness and higher cortisol within the “non-functional” range, 
suggesting that even “normal” cortisol concentrations may confer a spectrum of risk. The

 findings of our secondary analyses demonstrated that higher cortisol secretion within the 
presumed “normal” range associated with greater NFAT size and a higher prevalence of type 
2 diabetes. Although we did not observe a significant relation between NFAT size and 
incident outcomes, we presume that this effect was negated by the fact that larger NFAT (>4 
cm) may have been preferentially surgically resected in accordance with current guidelines 
(1, 2, 4, 15, 16).
Cortisol is a potent glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) 
agonist. As elegantly demonstrated by Arlt et al. in their studies of adrenal steroid profiling 
using mass spectrometry (20), when compared with healthy controls without adrenal tumors, 
NFAT secrete higher levels of glucocorticoids that are not typically measured or captured by 
our standard clinical assays of cortisol. Thus, our reliance on assessing cortisol as a 
surrogate for the functionality of adrenal tumors may be inadequate in that the spectrum of 
GR and MR agonists that are secreted may be much greater. Together, our findings provide 
some general support for the speculation that adrenal tumors may continue to secrete low 
concentrations of GR and/or MR agonists that can contribute to diabetes and cardiovascular 
disease risk, and therefore, future studies of NFAT should incorporate methods such as broad 
adrenal steroid profiling to better evaluate the spectrum of GR and MR agonists that might 
account for our findings of incident diabetes (20).
Our findings must be interpreted in the context of the limitations of our study design. First, 
observational studies can suffer from confounding and selection bias. Second, since the root 
cause of adrenal neoplasia remains unresolved, an alternative interpretation of our findings 
could be that an unknown factor that induces adrenal neoplasia may also increase the risk of 
diabetes. Regardless of the interpretation, the ultimate clinical applicability of our findings 
remains that patients with adrenal tumors have a higher risk for developing diabetes and 
therefore risk stratification should be considered. Third, we recognize that selection bias 
may have played a role in how we classified NFAT and that bias in the ascertainment of 
outcomes could have influenced the result. We used documentation of diagnoses to screen 
for adrenal tumors and detected only 1,346 participants from the >220,000 eligible 
participants without an adrenal hormonal diagnosis who underwent abdominal imaging. This 
<1% prevalence of adrenal tumors on imaging is much lower than previous reports (3–5), 
and may represent the fact that most incidentally discovered adrenal tumors were not 
officially included as diagnoses in the patient record, or were lost to follow-up during the 
clinical care of the primary indication for imaging. Therefore, it is possible that our selection 
of NFAT may have represented participants who had more visits to their healthcare 
providers; and/or had more conscientious healthcare providers; and/or had more abdominal 
imaging due to a greater burden of medical problems. However, we observed no major 
demographic or comorbidity differences in the eligible participants included in our incident 
composite diabetes analyses, and both exposure groups were followed for comparable 
durations of time with comparable screening and assessments of outcomes at comprehensive 
health encounters. Fourth, our findings may not be generalizable to men since the majority 
of our study population was female. The female predominance of our study population was 
unexpected, and may be due to the fact that women are much more likely than men to visit 
with and maintain longitudinal follow-up with their physicians (29, 30) and more likely to 
undergo abdominal imaging than men (of the >234,000 of abdominal scans available, 65%

 were in women). Fifth, we cannot exclude meaningful associations between NFAT and other 
outcomes where confidence intervals suggest the potential for a relationship. It should be 
noted that our classification of diabetes outcomes was the most refined since it incorporated 
documented diagnosis and/or supportive HbA1c levels. In contrast, the classification of 
some other clinical outcomes (such as hypertension) relied on documentation of diagnoses 
alone and the baseline prevalence of some of these outcomes was already high. Sixth, we did 
not have repeated and longitudinal assessments of adrenal hormones or NFAT size to assess 
whether new or worsening adrenal hormone excess could account for our findings (12–14). 
It is possible that NFAT are related to risk for diabetes due to the development of incident 
subclinical hypercortisolism that we did not assess; however, the underlying message of our 
study, that NFAT should be recognized and monitored as potential risk-factors for diabetes, 
is unlikely to change even if we had repeated measures of hormones or NFAT size. Lastly, 
we did not have ACTH levels to analyze as discussed earlier.
In summary, our findings demonstrate a significantly higher risk of developing incident 
diabetes in individuals with NFAT when compared to those without adrenal tumors. Given 
the high prevalence of incidentally discovered adrenal tumors that predominantly represent 
benign NFAT, our findings have important implications for general clinical practice and 
future research investigations: 1) the classification of “non-functional” may be an inadequate 
and misleading term to ascribe to benign adrenal tumors since it minimizes the potential 
continuum of adrenal hormone secretion that can contribute to cardiometabolic risk; 
therefore, the current accepted criteria by which we classify adrenal tumors as “non-
functional” may need re-evaluation; 2) these findings underscore the importance of 
recognizing incidentally discovered adrenal tumors as independent risk factors for 
developing diabetes that may warrant more frequent surveillance for glucose intolerance; 
and 3) future studies that include broad adrenal steroid metabolite profiling are needed to 
investigate whether NFAT secrete inappropriate amounts of glucocorticoid that evade our 
current clinical practice and contribute to adverse outcomes.

 Figure 2. Cases of incident composite diabetes during longitudinal follow-up
Shown are the proportion of participants who developed incident composite diabetes during 
follow-up. Eligible participants did not have any type of diabetes at baseline (the time of 
imaging), and had ≥3 years of follow-up. Panel (A) shows all 725 eligible participants (110 
with NFAT and 625 without adrenal tumors), where participants with NFAT had subclinical 
hypercortisolism excluded using either a 1mg DST or a 24h UFC. Panel (B) shows only 
those participants with NFAT who had subclinical hypercortisolism excluded using a 1mg 
DST≤1.8 mcg/dL (73 eligible), and panel (C) shows only those participants with NFAT who 
had subclinical hypercortisolism excluded using a 24h UFC<50 mcg (50 eligible). Panel (D) 
depicts an exploratory analysis, whereby participants who were initially excluded from the 
main analysis due to potential subclinical hypercortisolism were included, and compared 
with all the eligible participants without adrenal tumors and with NFAT to assess incident 
composite diabetes.
Blue squares and lines indicate participants with no adrenal tumors.
Red diamonds and lines indicate participants with NFAT.
Black circles and lines indicate participants with adrenal tumors and subclinical 
hypercortisolism.
