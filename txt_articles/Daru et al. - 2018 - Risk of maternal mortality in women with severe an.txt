Summary
Background Anaemia affects as many as half of all pregnant women in low-income and middle-income countries, but the 
burden of disease and associated maternal mortality are not robustly quantified. We aimed to assess the association between 
severe anaemia and maternal death with data from the WHO Multicountry Survey on maternal and newborn health.
Methods We used multilevel and propensity score regression analyses to establish the relation between severe 
anaemia and maternal death in 359 health facilities in 29 countries across Latin America, Africa, the Western Pacific, 
eastern Mediterranean, and southeast Asia. Severe anaemia was defined as antenatal or postnatal haemoglobin 
concentrations of less than 70 g/L in a blood sample obtained before death. Maternal death was defined as death any 
time after admission until the seventh day post partum or discharge. In regression analyses, we adjusted for post-
partum haemorrhage, general anaesthesia, admission to intensive care, sepsis, pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, 
thrombocytopenia, shock, massive transfusion, severe oliguria, failure to form clots, and severe acidosis as 
confounding variables. These variables were used to develop the propensity score.
Findings 312 281 women admitted in labour or with ectopic pregnancies were included in the adjusted multilevel 
logistic analysis, and 12 470 were included in the propensity score regression analysis. The adjusted odds ratio for 
maternal death in women with severe anaemia compared with those without severe anaemia was 2∙36 (95% CI 
1∙60–3∙48). In the propensity score analysis, severe anaemia was also associated with maternal death (adjusted odds 
ratio 1∙86 [95% CI 1∙39–2∙49]).
Interpretation Prevention and treatment of anaemia during pregnancy and post partum should remain a global public 
health and research priority.

Introduction
As many as half of all pregnant women in low-income and 
middle-income countries are diagnosed with anaemia,1,2 
which affects 32 million pregnant women worldwide.2 
Women in low-income and middle-income countries 
are at increased risk of anaemia1 because of the higher 
frequency of dietary iron deficiency, haemoglobino-
pathies, macronutrient deficiencies, and infections such 
as malaria, HIV, and hookworm infestation in those 
countries than in high-income countries.3 Anaemia has 
been associated with increased prevalence of ante-partum 
and post-partum haemorrhage.4
WHO has recognised anaemia as a global problem 
with serious consequence for mothers and their babies.5 
Even though anaemia in pregnancy is readily treatable, 
data from several studies show an association between 
maternal anaemia and severe adverse maternal and 
perinatal outcomes.2 The findings of these studies were 
not robust as a result of methodical limitations, including 
small sample sizes, use of surrogate outcome measures,6 
inconsistent definitions of severe morbidity,7 and failure 
to adjust for relevant confounders. Thus, severe anaemia 
is strongly correlated with maternal morbidity secondary 
to known clinical and biological factors.8 Furthermore, 
the crucially important outcome of maternal death is 
often not reported or is reported with low precision 
because of the rarity of events9 in small and retrospective 
datasets.4,10 As a result, the relation between severe 
anaemia and maternal mortality is not well understood.
The absence of robust evidence of severe anaemia and 
maternal mortality could affect prioritisation of anaemia 
as an important condition in its own right. We assessed 
the association of severe anaemia with maternal 
mortality in a large, multicountry dataset gathered via 
standardised procedures.
Methods
Survey methods and participants

sectional study in which data were collected for all

delivery and severe maternal outcomes (ie, maternal 
death and maternal near-miss) with standardised 
methods at 359 health facilities in 29 countries across 
Latin America, Africa, the Western Pacific, eastern 
Mediterranean and southeast Asia between May, 2010, 
and 
December, 
2011. 
The 
included 
countries 
were Afghanistan, Angola, Argentina, Brazil, Cambodia, 
China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ecuador, 
India, 
Japan, 
Jordan, 
Kenya, 
Lebanon, 
Mexico, 
Mongolia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, 
Palestine, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Sri Lanka, 
Thailand, Uganda, and Vietnam. They were chosen on 
the basis of their participation in the WHO Global 
Country Survey and on assessments of feasibility. Types 
of health-care facilities included government-funded 
regional and local hospitals, and community hospitals. 
Detailed explanations of the methods have been 
published previously.11,12
The WHO Multicountry Survey was based on a 
stratified multistage cluster-sampling approach to obtain 
a global sample of pregnancy complications. Within each 
region, two randomly selected provinces and the capital 
city of each country were sampled. Within each capital 
city and province, seven institutions with more than 
1000 deliveries per year and the capacity for caesarean 
deliveries were randomly selected (if there were fewer 
than seven eligible institutions, all eligible institutions 
were included). Data were collected for 2 months in 
institutions with more than 6000 deliveries per year data, 
and for 3 months in institutions with fewer than 
6000 deliveries per year. In countries where fewer than 
3000 deliveries were anticipated per year, data were 
gathered for 4 months at all centres. Health-care facilities 
were the primary sampling level of the WHO 
Multicountry Survey, and thus individual level analyses 
could be affected by clustering.
The study population comprised all women giving 
birth in participating hospitals and their respective 
neonates; all maternal near-miss cases admitted to 
participating hospitals, irrespective of gestational age 
and delivery status; and all maternal deaths in 
participating hospitals, irrespective of gestational age 
and delivery status, during the data collection period. 
Those in whom severe outcomes were a result of 
miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy were also included. 
Data were gathered for all eligible individuals from 
admission to a health-care facility until 7 days post 
partum or post abortion, discharge, or death (whichever 
came first). Thus, complications that occurred before 
presentation, more than 7 days post partum, after 
discharge, or during a post-partum readmission were 
not recorded. Data were captured via a pre-tested 
individual data collection form. Trained data collectors 
reviewed medical records and abstracted data into 
the forms daily; there was no contact with eligible 
women. Clarification, when needed, was sought from 
clinical staff. Additionally, data collectors completed an 
institutional form in consultation with the head of 
the obstetric department, in which obstetric, neonatal, 
and intensive-care capacity, and capacity to identify a 
range of laboratory, clinical, and management severity 
indicators for mothers and neonates were captured. 
Data for both the individual and institutional forms 
were then entered into a web-based management 
system. Ethical approval for the original Multicountry 
Survey was granted by WHO’s Ethical Review 
Committee, and was also sought in each contributing 
country. This specific analysis was approved by the 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Anaemia in pregnancy is associated with severe maternal 
morbidity and an indirect cause of maternal death across pregnant 
populations in both low-income and high-income settings.
We searched MEDLINE and Embase with the terms “anaemia”, 
“anemia”, “anae*”, “anem*”, “pregnancy”, “pregnan*”, 
“mother”, “mortality”, “death”, and “maternal mortality” for 
observational studies published in any language before 
June 19, 2017. We also searched in WHO’s study registry. We did 
not identify any large international analyses of the association 
between severe anaemia and maternal death, but noted 
several small national or regional studies with methodological 
limitations, such as small sample size, in which the small 
number of events prevented development of a robust model 
with adequate adjustment for known confounding variables.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, ours is the first study to explore the 
independent association of severe anaemia with maternal 
mortality. We noted an independent association to varying 
degrees in an ethnically and geographically diverse population. 
Because severe anaemia was recorded as a binary variable in our 
dataset (from the WHO Multicountry Survey), we could not 
examine whether a dose–response relationship exists between 
haemoglobin concentration and maternal mortality. 
Nonetheless, we identified an association that was present in 
several different regions and reproducible with different 
statistical techniques, even after adjustment for several known 
confounding variables.
Implications of all the available evidence
Irrespective of the cause, severe anaemia should be treated 
with vigour. Our findings support the use of haematological 
indices as outcome measures that are strongly associated with 
clinical outcomes. Our work also shows the need to prioritise 
the prevention and management of anaemia in pregnancy as a 
global public health and research priority.

review of our protocol. 
Definitions and variables
Haemoglobin was measured in accordance with 
standard clinical practice. Severe anaemia was recorded 
as an independent pregnancy complication if the 
haemoglobin measurement in an antenatal or postnatal 
blood sample taken before the outcome was less than 
70 g/L (in line with WHO’s definition of near miss for 
women who experience severe complications of 
pregnancy or delivery and nearly die, but survive).13 
Women without anaemia and those with haemoglobin 
concentrations of 70–120 g/L were grouped together. 
Maternal death was defined as death any time after 
admission until the seventh day post partum or 
discharge (whichever came first). Our approach follows 
the standards used by the WHO Multicountry Survey 
Research Network and previous analyses of this 
dataset.14 A list of the potential confounding variables 
and their respective definitions sought for adjustment 
within statistical models are provided in the appendix 
in accordance with reporting guidelines for regression 
models.15
Statistical analysis
In our analysis, we included all women admitted for 
delivery or ectopic pregnancy with or without severe 
anaemia at facilities where there were more than 
100 cases (to avoid instability and problems of 
convergence related to small sample sizes). We explored 
the relation between severe anaemia and maternal 
death with two approaches: a multilevel logistic 
regression analysis and a propensity score regression 
analysis.
We fitted an explanatory multilevel logistic regression 
model with maternal death as the dependent binary 
outcome and severe anaemia as the main exposure. We 
defined a three-level model for women (first level) giving 
birth in facilities (second level) within countries 
(third level). We selected a set of potential confounding 
variables from the covariates captured by the data 
extraction form a priori. Covariates selected had to have 
a plausible biological relation to the association between 
severe anaemia and maternal death (appendix). Selection 
of covariates was an iterative process that involved 
informal discussions with clinicians, epidemiologists, 
and laboratory scientists. We aimed to adjust the 
association of severe anaemia with the outcome of 
maternal death. Thus, we defined a confounding effect 
as a change of greater than 10% between the adjusted 
and unadjusted or crude odds ratio (OR) for severe 
anaemia and maternal death. We used a non-automated 
backwards elimination strategy to select variables 
included in the final model. All variables that were 
significant (ie, p<0∙05) in the adjustment were included 
in the final model.
Because we noted important differences in baseline 
clinical characteristics between women with and 
without severe anaemia, we did a second analysis based 
on propensity scores to mitigate confounding bias 
caused by the imbalance between the characteristics of 
the groups under comparison. We developed16 a score 
that represents the propensity (ie, the conditional 
probability) of a woman to develop severe anaemia in 
view of her clinical characteristics. Compared with 
classic multi 
variate adjustments, the propensity score 
permitted finer adjustments for wider sets of covariates. 
To obtain the score, we fitted a logistic regression 
model, with severe anaemia as a binary dependent 
variable and adjusted with the same covariates used in 
the multilevel logistic regression analysis (appendix). 
We used the propensity score to match, without 
replacement, women with severe anaemia and women 
without severe anaemia in a 1:2 ratio, to optimise the 
precision of the estimate of association and limit bias.17 
Matched pairs were chosen from within countries. 
We established a caliper of 0·25 of the SD of the 
propensity score,18 resulting in a small caliper but an 
excellent balance of women with severe anaemia 
and those without as matched samples. We computed 
standardised differences (ie, the difference in pro-
portions divided by the SD) for all variables included in 
the propensity score before and after matching to assess 
the effect of matching on the imbalance. We deemed 
a 10% standardised difference as the limit for

a correct balance. We also computed the post-match 
C statistic to assess the degree of balance.19 After 
matching, we compared maternal mortality between 
women with severe anaemia and those without severe 
anaemia as matched groups. We calculated an adjusted 
OR to quantify the association between severe anaemia 
and maternal death, and used univariate logistic 
regression fitted by generalised estimating equations to 
account for matched data.
To assess the effect of reducing severe anaemia on 
mortality, we calculated the population attributable 
fraction20 to estimate the reduction in mortality that 
would occur if severe anaemia was completely eradicated 
in the study sample:
where Pc is the proportion of cases that are exposed and 
αOR is the adjusted OR for the effect of anaemia on 
mortality.
We used the non-random package in R (version 1.42) 
for the propensity score matching, and STATA/IC 
(version 15.0) for all remaining statistical analysis.

Results
312 281 pregnancies (including 96 ectopic pregnancies), 
4687 cases of severe anaemia and 341 maternal 
deaths at 336 facilities were included in the multilevel 
analysis (figure 1). Table 1 shows the characteristics of 
included women with and without severe anaemia. 
12 470 women—4189 women with severe anaemia 
matched with 8281 women without severe anaemia—
from 309 facilities, and 146 maternal deaths were included 
in the propensity score analysis (figure 1). For 97 women 
with severe anaemia, only one match could be found (ie, 
they were matched 1:1 rather than 1:2).
The odds of maternal death was higher in mothers 
with severe anaemia than in those without severe 
anaemia in both the crude (OR 43∙35 [95% CI

(adjusted OR 2∙36 [95% CI 1∙60–3∙48], p<0·0001; 
table 2). The propensity score matching algorithm 
largely reduced the initial imbalance between women 
with and without severe anaemia, with between-group 
standardised differences for all instances lower than the 
recommended 10% limit (figure 2, table 3). After 
matching, the C statistic was 0∙506, which suggests 
almost-perfect matching. Overall, propensity score 
regression analysis showed an association between 
severe anaemia and maternal death (adjusted OR 1∙86 
[95% CI 1∙39–2∙49], p<0·0001; table 2). The population 
attributable fraction was 0∙184.
We did sensitivity analyses for both the multilevel and 
the propensity score regression models. When cases 
of post-partum haemorrhage were removed from the 
multilevel regression model, the adjusted OR between 
severe anaemia and maternal death was more pronounced 
(4∙58 [95% CI 2∙87–7∙31]). The association between 
anaemia and maternal mortality was unchanged when 
post-partum haemorrhage was classed as “none”, 
“moderate”, or “severe” according to use of medical 
and surgical management strategies (adjusted OR 2∙41 
[95% CI 1∙63–3∙55]). In the propensity regression analysis, 
changing the caliper between the cases with severe 
anaemia and those without severe anaemia did not affect 
the size or direction of the estimate (data not shown).
Discussion
In our analysis of a dataset of 312 281 pregnancies in 
29 countries from the WHO Multicountry Survey, the odds 
of maternal death were twice as high in those with severe 
anaemia compared with those without severe anaemia. 
The association seemed to be moderately strong, temporal, 
and consistent and was reproducible in both multilevel 
and propensity score regression analyses. Previously 
published estimates of the relation between anaemia and 
maternal mortality were limited by low event rates, low 
geographical variability,4 and residual confounding 
variables.10 Furthermore, maternal death is rarely reported 
as an outcome in randomised studies, and therefore such 
analyses necessitate use of observational data.10
Our finding of a link between severe maternal anaemia 
and mortality challenges the assumption that haemato-
logical indices such as haemoglobin are not suitable 
outcome measures.6 The insistence that clinical outcomes 
be used for assessment of effectiveness of iron interventions 
will necessitate larger, more complicated studies (possibly 
of composite outcomes) to ensure adequate power.6 The 
implications of our findings are far reaching, because 
severe anaemia is globally prevalent.2 The implementation 
of international recommendations on iron fortification,21 
targeted iron supplementation,5 anthelminthic therapy 
programmes,5 blood management strategies, and access to 
transfusion services should be vigorously reinforced. 
Importantly, maternal anaemia should remain an 
important priority, and merits renewed focus in terms of 
public health interventions and from clinicians caring for 
women during pregnancy and labour. Increased focus on 
effective prevention is needed, because approaches so far 
have not effectively addressed the problem.
Our study had several strengths. The dataset was large 
and diverse (both geographically and ethnically), with 
ample numbers of events and many available con-
founding variables, allowing for adjustment of statistical 
models without compromising the model’s goodness-of-
fit.22 We used two types of regression analyses to ensure 
that our findings were not affected by our choice of 
statistical modelling. The confounding variables chosen 
were from an extensive list of data gathered within the 
original study.12 We chose variables that had a plausible 
biological relation with severe anaemia and maternal 
death, those that, if present in the context of severe 
anaemia, worsen outcomes (appendix), and those that 
are associated with maternal death such as shock, 
admission to intensive care, and severe acidosis. The 
relevance of these variables helps to explain the great 
reduction from the crude OR after adjustment.
The association of anaemia with poor maternal 
outcomes, including increased morbidity related to 
post-partum haemorrhage,23 antenatal sepsis, and post-
natal sepsis, is well reported.24 We are confident that our 
adjustment of the statistical models has a rational a-priori 
basis. We were, however, limited in our choice of 
variables for adjustment, by what was recorded within 
the original WHO study. 341 maternal deaths were 
recorded in the survey sample, and our adjusted model 
included 12 variables—well within the rule of thumb of 
one confounder per ten outcome events.25
Our study also had several limitations. Anaemia data 
were collected according to the WHO definition of 
severe adverse outcome.12 Thus, anaemia was recorded 
as a binary variable (ie, present [haemoglobin <70 g/L] or 
absent [haemoglobin ≥70g/L]), and actual haemoglobin 
concentrations were not recorded. As a result, women

with mild-to-moderate anaemia were grouped with 
women without anaemia as the comparator. This 
grouping probably weakens the association identified, 
and also meant that we could not assess a potential 
dose–response relation between severe anaemia and 
maternal death. Furthermore, the timing of severe 
anaemia (antenatal or postnatal) was not recorded. 
However, with respect to temporality of association, all 
data for severe anaemia were gathered before maternal 
death occurred. Future similar research should explore 
haemoglobin as a continuous variable with maternal 
morbidity or mortality, or both, and whether higher 
haemoglobin concentrations are associated with adverse 
maternal outcomes.
More than 4000 cases were excluded from our analyses 
because of missing data. This issue was due to how data 
were gathered in the original survey12 (ie, in a binary 
fashion), which meant that multiple imputation strategies 
could not be used.26 Unfortunately, we could not examine 
in depth how these missing data affected the estimate of 
the relation between severe anaemia and maternal death.
We used propensity score regression analysis in 
addition to multivariable logistic models, because such 
analyses allow for comparisons of outcomes of interest 
from observational data via a scoring system for groups 
with similar characteristics, mimicking a randomised 
study.27 In propensity score analysis, important differences 
between groups are minimised (eg, achieving similarity 
in baseline characteristics reduces the risk of selection 
bias), although we cannot completely exclude the 
possibility of residual confounding—some relevant 
variables could be inadvertently omitted from the score. 
The use of propensity score analysis for data from the 
WHO Multicountry Survey is novel and supported the 
main findings of the logistic regression model.
The availability of care varied between the individual 
facilities contributing data to the dataset. An analysis 
stratified by individual facilities was unfeasible and 
therefore was not done. We controlled for variables that 
could predispose women to postnatal anaemia in our 
multilevel and propensity regression analyses and did 
sensitivity analyses to establish whether the relation 
between severe anaemia and maternal death was solely 
related to post-partum haemorrhage within these data.
We are confident that our findings are a robust 
demonstration of an independent link between severe 
anaemia and maternal death. Although our data cannot 
explain a direct causal relation between severe anaemia 
and maternal death, examination of the extent to 
which causal criteria have been met by our work is 
worthwhile.28 We noted a moderately strong association 
between severe anaemia and maternal death in the 
multilevel regression analysis on the basis of published 
criteria, with a point estimate (ie, adjusted OR) in the 
range of 2–5.29,30 By these criteria, the association was 
weak in the propensity score regression analysis, but 
this statistical approach underestimates the strength 
of associations.31 The association was temporal in that 
the exposure measurements (severe anaemia) were 
obtained before the occurrence of the outcome (death). 
This relation has biological plausibility,28 because 
severe anaemia reduces tissue oxygen availability (via 
a reduction in circulating haemoglobin), reduces iron 
availability for DNA synthesis, and alters enzyme 
function,2 all of which could contribute to an association 
between severe anaemia and maternal death. The 
relation between severe anaemia and maternal death 
was also consistently noted with varied statistical 
approaches.28,32 We could not study if there was a 
biological gradient.

Our sensitivity analyses showed that, when cases of 
post-partum haemorrhage were removed from the 
multilevel regression model, the strength of the 
association between severe anaemia and maternal death 
increased. Thus, inclusion of post-partum haemorrhage 
in our models could have resulted in underestimation of 
the strength of the relation. Furthermore, our sensitivity 
analyses emphasise that severe anaemia in pregnant and 
postnatal women strongly and independently contributes 
to adverse outcomes, irrespective of the cause. Anaemia 
treatment and prevention in pregnancy should remain a 
global priority.
