IMPORTANCE In treatment-resistant schizophrenia, clozapine is considered the standard
treatment. However, clozapine use has restrictions owing to its many adverse effects.
Moreover, an increasing number of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of other antipsychotics
have been published.
OBJECTIVE To integrate all the randomized evidence from the available antipsychotics used
for treatment-resistant schizophrenia by performing a network meta-analysis.
DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, PsycINFO, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials, World Health Organization International Trial Registry, and clinicaltrials.gov
were searched up to June 30, 2014.
STUDY SELECTION At least 2 independent reviewers selected published and unpublished
single- and double-blind RCTs in treatment-resistant schizophrenia (any study-defined
criterion) that compared any antipsychotic (at any dose and in any form of administration)
with another antipsychotic or placebo.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS At least 2 independent reviewers extracted all data into
standard forms and assessed the quality of all included trials with the Cochrane Collaboration’
s
risk-of-bias tool. Data were pooled using a random-effects model in a Bayesian setting.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was efficacy as measured by overall
change in symptoms of schizophrenia. Secondary outcomes included change in positive and
negative symptoms of schizophrenia, categorical response to treatment, dropouts for any
reason and for inefficacy of treatment, and important adverse events.
RESULTS Forty blinded RCTs with 5172 unique participants (71.5% men; mean [SD] age, 38.8
[3.7] years) were included in the analysis. Few significant differences were found in all
outcomes. In the primary outcome (reported as standardized mean difference; 95% credible
interval), olanzapine was more effective than quetiapine (−0.29; −0.56 to −0.02), haloperidol
(−0. 29; −0.44 to −0.13), and sertindole (−0.46; −0.80 to −0.06); clozapine was more effective
than haloperidol (−0.22; −0.38 to −0.07) and sertindole (−0.40; −0.74 to −0.04); and
risperidone was more effective than sertindole (−0.32; −0.63 to −0.01). A pattern of superiority
for olanzapine, clozapine, and risperidone was seen in other efficacy outcomes, but results were
not consistent and effect sizes were usually small. In addition, relatively few RCTs were available
for antipsychotics other than clozapine, haloperidol, olanzapine, and risperidone. The most
surprising finding was that clozapine was not significantly better than most other drugs.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Insufficient evidence exists on which antipsychotic is more
efficacious for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and blinded RCTs—in contrast
to unblinded, randomized effectiveness studies—provide little evidence of the superiority of
clozapine compared with other second-generation antipsychotics. Future clozapine studies
with high doses and patients with extremely treatment-refractory schizophrenia might be
most promising to change the current evidence.

A
s many as one-third of patients with schizophrenia
experience persistent psychotic symptoms despite
adequate treatment with antipsychotics.1 At present,
clozapine is considered the standard treatment for patients
with refractory forms of schizophrenia, which has been
codified in international guidelines.1-4 Unanimity concern-
ing the superiority of clozapine is based mainly on the land-
mark study by Kane et al5,6 that resulted in an impressive
effect size of clozapine compared with chlorpromazine
hydrochloride and led to clozapine’
s reintroduction in clini-
cal practice. Although subsequent comparisons7,8 with first-
generation antipsychotics (FGAs) showed smaller effect
sizes than the dramatic superiority in the study by Kane et
al,5,6 the superiority of clozapine compared with FGAs for
treatment-resistant schizophrenia has been corroborated
by an early meta-analysis of 12 trials9 and a Cochrane
review.10,11 Moreover, researchers12 found that clozapine
was the most efficacious antipsychotic in a network meta-
analysis (NMA) of trials for treatment of nonrefractory
schizophrenia, but the superiority was again driven by old
comparisons with FGAs. Indeed, in a Cochrane review using
a simple pairwise meta-analysis,13 clozapine was not more
efficacious than the second-generation antipsychotics
(SGAs) olanzapine, risperidone, or ziprasidone.
The reintroduction of clozapine led to the development
of numerous other SGAs, some of which showed superior
efficacy in meta-analyses not restricted to patients with
treatment-resistant disease.12,14,15 Moreover, effectiveness
studies suggested that some older agents, such as
perphenazine16 or sulpiride,17 might be as efficacious as
SGAs, but their effects in treatment-resistant schizophrenia
are unknown. Given the restrictions of clozapine use owing
to its many adverse effects, such as agranulocytosis, meta-
bolic problems, or sedation, and in light of a continuously
increasing number of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of
other SGAs, a new systematic review and meta-analysis on
the effects of the various antipsychotics in treatment-
resistant schizophrenia appeared to be necessary.
In an attempt to integrate all the evidence from the
available antipsychotics in treatment-resistant schizophre-
nia, we performed simple pairwise meta-analyses and an
NMA (also called a multiple-treatments meta-analysis), a
technique that allows the comparison of the relative effec-
tiveness among all antipsychotics that have been examined
in at least 1 trial. A particular advantage of this technique is
that one can obtain an effect estimate for the relative effec-
tiveness between 2 interventions, even if they have not
been compared directly in any trial, as long as they are part
of a connected network.18,19 This technique uses indirect
comparison of the 2 treatments of interest via 1 or more
intermediate comparators. Moreover, even when outcome
data for a particular comparison exist, the use of all avail-
able information, direct and indirect, renders the effect esti-
mate more precise than the pairwise meta-analysis counter-
part. Such advantages have established NMA as a powerful
evidence synthesis tool, and its use is crucial in health care
areas where many drugs are available, such as in treatment-
resistant schizophrenia.

demonstrated a high risk for bias for sequence generation or al-
location concealment were excluded.23 If a trial was described
as double-blind but randomization was not explicitly men-
tioned, we assumed that study participants were randomized,
and we excluded the trial in a sensitivity analysis. Study qual-
ity was independently assessed by 2 reviewers (M.D. and B.H.),
who used the Cochrane Collaboration’

Key Points
Question: What is the most effective and acceptable antipsychotic
for treatment-resistant schizophrenia?
Findings: A certain pattern of superiority was found for olanzapine,
clozapine, and risperidone in various efficacy outcomes, such as
mean change in overall and positive symptoms, response rates, and
dropouts owing to inefficacy, but treatment efficacy differences
were not definitive and clozapine was no more efficacious than
most other second-generation antipsychotics. Although substantial
evidence was available for clozapine, haloperidol, olanzapine, and
risperidone, data on the other included antipsychotics were limited.
Meaning: Insufficient evidence exists on which antipsychotic is
more efficacious for patients with treatment-resistant
schizophrenia.

methods.24,25 We sent emails to the first and corresponding
authors of all included studies to ask for missing data.
Outcome Measures and Data Extraction
The primary outcome was the mean change from baseline to
end point in overall symptoms of schizophrenia as measured
by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS),26 the
Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale,27 or any other validated scale
for the assessment of overall schizophrenia symptoms. If
change data were not available, we used the mean score at
study end point of these scales. Intention-to-treat data sets
were used whenever available.
Secondary outcome was a clinically important response to
treatment that was defined primarily as at least a 20% reduc-
tion of PANSS or Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale score or at least
minimal improvement on the Clinical Global Impressions
Scale.28,29 In patients with treatment-resistant schizophre-
nia, even a slight improvement might represent a clinically sig-
nificant effect, justifying the use of the 20% cutoff, which
roughly corresponds to at least minimal improvement on the
ClinicalGlobalImpressionsScale.30Forthetypicalpatientwith
acute schizophrenia, the 50% cutoff, corresponding to much
improvement on the Clinical Global Impressions Scale, might
be preferable.31 Other secondary outcomes were the mean
change in positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia,
dropoutsowingtoanyreason(all-causediscontinuation),drop-
outs owing to inefficacy of treatment, the occurrence of im-
portant adverse effects (ie, weight gain, extrapyramidal symp-
toms, and sedation), quality of life, ability to work, and
economic outcomes.
Study selection and data extraction were performed in-
dependently by at least 2 reviewers (M.T.S., M.D., B.H., and
S.L.). Missing SDs were estimated from P values or substi-
tuted by the mean SD of the other included studies.
Statistical Analysis
DatawereanalyzedfromOctober13,2014,toMarch3,2015.We
performed pairwise meta-analyses and NMA in a Bayesian set-
tingusingWinBUGs.32-35Weusedtherandom-effectsmodeland
assumed common heterogeneity across all comparisons. For
continuousoutcomes,theeffectsizeswerecalculatedasHedges
adjusted g standardized mean differences (SMDs).36 For bi-
nary outcomes, the effect sizes were calculated as odds ratios
(ORs).Bothtypesofeffectsizeswerepresentedalongwiththeir
95% credible intervals (CRIs). To enhance understandability,
SMDs were also transformed in original units and ORs in num-
bers needed to benefit (NNTB) and numbers needed to harm
(NNTH),whichwereestimatedwiththemeanoccurrenceofan
outcomeasthebaselinerisk.TheNMAcombineddirectandin-
direct evidence of all relative treatment effects, provided esti-
mates with maximum power, and allowed the ranking of the
various antipsychotics based on the surface under the cumu-
lative ranking and the mean ranks.37
The assumption underlying the performance of NMA is
transitivity, which suggests that all pairwise comparisons in
the network do not differ with respect to the distribution of
effectmodifiers.19,38,39Importantintransitivitymightbemani-
fested in the data as inconsistency between direct and indi-
rect evidence. Consistency was assessed by calculating the dif-
ference between direct and indirect treatment effects in all
closed loops and assuming loop-specific heterogeneity.40-43
The magnitude of inconsistency factors and their respective
P values were used to examine the presence of inconsistency
in each loop; we judged loops to be inconsistent with a sig-
nificant disagreement between direct and indirect evidence
(P < .10). To assess the evidence of inconsistency in the en-
tire network, we used the design-by-treatment model,44-46
which enabled us to examine the presence of loop and design
inconsistency.
Toassesstheeffectofpotentialmoderatorandqualityvari-
ables on the primary outcome, we planned several meta-
regression, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses in advance. In
separate network metaregression models, the variables’pub-
lication date, quality of randomization and allocation conceal-
ment, dose of antipsychotics in chlorpromazine equivalents,47
and severity of illness at baseline were included as covari-
ates. Other analyses were added post hoc, including the dose
ofantipsychoticsusing2alternativemethodstocalculatechlor-
promazine equivalents,48,49 dose of clozapine, trial duration,
and study sponsorship.
The definition of treatment resistance varied across stud-
ies. In a preplanned subgroup analysis, the included studies
were classified into the following 3 groups according to the ap-
plied criteria for defining treatment resistance: (1) no re-
sponse to 1 previous antipsychotic, (2) no response to at least
2 retrospective periods of antipsychotic treatment, and (3) no
responsetoacombinationofretrospectiveandprospectivecri-
teria for treatment resistance.
In preplanned sensitivity analyses, we used the fixed-
effect model, and we excluded trials with only completer data,
trials that included patients who previously demonstrated
treatment intolerance, trials that did not apply operational-
ized criteria to diagnose schizophrenia, and single-blind trials.
In a post hoc sensitivity analysis, we performed pairwise meta-
analyses and NMA for the primary outcome that included 5
studies published before 1990 that had to be excluded from
the main analysis because they led to inconsistency (de-
scribed in the Consistency of the Network subsection of the
Results). The motivation underlying this sensitivity analysis
was to show the full evidence of antipsychotic efficacy and to
justify that the decision to exclude studies conducted before
1990 in the main analysis did not introduce bias. Other post
hoc sensitivity analyses involved the exclusion of trials with
a high risk for attrition bias and those with a high risk for
reporting bias.
We investigated the presence of small-study effects for the
primary outcome to assess whether important differences in
treatmenteffectestimateswerefoundbetweenpreciseandim-
precise studies. We produced 2 comparison-adjusted funnel
plots;comparisonshavebeendirectedaccordingtotheageand
effectiveness of the treatments, assuming that newer and
more effective treatments, respectively, are favored in small

Results
Description of Included Studies
Weidentified40uniqueblindedRCTs 6-8,51-87with5172unique
participants published from 1968 to March 2012 through the
literature search. The PRISMA flowchart is shown in Figure 1
and with details of all included studies in eAppendix 3 in the
Supplement. Of 4813 patients with sex indicated, 3442 were
men (71.5%). The mean (SD) age of participants was 38.8 (3.7)
years; the mean (SD) duration of illness, 16.2 (4.3) years; and
the mean (SD) number of previous hospitalizations, 6.9 (3.1).
The median trial duration was 11 weeks. The assessment of
risk for bias is presented in eAppendix 4 in the Supplement.
Overall, the trial reports often did not provide details about
randomization procedures and allocation concealment;
4 studies69,76,78,84 were single-blind and the remaining were
double-blind. The mean dropout rate was 30.2% for the stud-
ies included in our analysis, and we found some indication of
selective reporting in 18 studies (45.0%). Figure 2 shows the
network of eligible comparisons for the primary outcome; net-
work plots for secondary outcomes are presented in eAppen-
dix 5 in the Supplement. The mean dose of the 12 antipsychot-
ics included in the analysis was 794 mg/d in chlorpromazine
equivalents.47 The drug involved in most comparisons was
clozapine (20 of 40 trials), followed by haloperidol (15 of 40
trials), olanzapine (14 of 40 trials), and risperidone (12 of 40
trials), whereas few trials were available for most other drugs.
Three antipsychotics (aripiprazole, perphenazine, and thio-
thixene hydrochloride), although included in the systematic
review, were not included in the meta-analysis because one
of the 2 relevant studies was not connected to the network51
and the other52 did not provide usable data (further explana-
tions can be found in eAppendix 3 in the Supplement).

Cohen91 recommended that an SMD of –0.20 is small, −0.50 is
medium, and −0.80 is large. Few statistically significant differ-
ences were found. In the simple pairwise meta-analytic com-

Pairwise (upper right portion) and network (lower left portion) meta-analytic
results are shown for the primary outcome. Drugs are reported in order of
efficacy ranking, and outcomes are expressed as standardized mean differences
(SMDs) (95% credible intervals). For the pairwise meta-analyses, SMDs of less
than 0 indicate that the treatment specified in the row is more efficacious. For
the network meta-analysis (NMA), SMDs of less than 0 indicate that the
treatment specified in the column is more efficacious. Bold results indicate
statistical significance. The overall heterogeneity (τ) is 0.11 for pairwise results
and 0.08 for NMA results. To obtain SMDs for comparisons in the opposite
direction, negative values should be converted into positive values and vice
versa.

Adverse Events
Few significant differences were found in terms of adverse
events (eAppendix 9 in the Supplement). As expected, the pat-
terns were generally consistent with the previous NMA12 in pa-
tients with non–treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but fewer
findings were statistically significant, which may be attrib-
uted to the lower number of included participants.
Other Outcomes
Only 5 studies8,51,72,75,87 provided data on quality of life. The
pairwise meta-analysis did not indicate any significant dif-
ference among antipsychotics (eAppendix 9 in the Supple-
ment), whereas conducting an NMA was not feasible. No
data were available for ability to work and economic out-
comes.
Sensitivity Analyses of the Primary Outcome
The most important sensitivity analysis was the inclusion of
the 5 old studies5,6,52-55 that were excluded from the pri-
mary analysis owing to a violation of the consistency
assumption. Including these trials did not change the
results much (eAppendix 6 in the Supplement). The only
change in pairwise comparisons was that clozapine was now
significantly better than chlorpromazine (sensitivity analy-
sis SMD, −0.74 [95% CRI, −0.99 to −0.49] vs main analysis
SMD, −0.44 [95% CRI, −1.10 to 0.22]). In the NMA, the main
change was a few differences in terms of statistical signifi-
cance. Olanzapine was ranked first as in the main analysis,
whereas clozapine was ranked second compared with third
in the main analysis, but clozapine was still not significantly
superior to all other SGAs. In the remaining sensitivity
analyses, SMDs and rankings did not change considerably,
or so few studies remained that hardly any result was sig-
nificant (eAppendix 10 in the Supplement).
Subgroup and Metaregression Analyses
for the Primary Outcome
Forthedegreeoftreatmentresistance,the3subgroupsofstud-
ies based on the criteria for defining treatment resistance (de-
scribed in the Statistical Analysis subsection of the Methods
section) were formed. No significant efficacy difference was
shown among antipsychotics in any of these subgroups, prob-
ably because the available data per group were less than that
of the main analysis (eAppendix 10 in the Supplement). Simi-
lar results were obtained when all trials, irrespective of their
publicationdate,wereincludedinthissubgroupanalysis(eAp-
pendix 6 in the Supplement).
Moreover, we found no significant effects in metaregres-
sions examining the impact of the possible effect modifiers
(eAppendix 10 in the Supplement), but these analyses also had
limited statistical power, and any interpretation should be
made with great caution.
Small-Study Effects, Original Units, NNTBs, and NNTHs
We found no evidence of small-study effects for the primary
outcome (eAppendix 11 in the Supplement). The SMDs back
transformed to original units, and NNTBs, and NNTHs can be
found in eAppendices 12 and 13 in the Supplement.
Discussion
We compared the effects of all antipsychotics in patients with
treatment-resistant schizophrenia using pairwise meta-
analyses and NMA. Olanzapine, clozapine, and risperidone
were found to be significantly better than some other antipsy-
chotics in various efficacy outcomes, but the results were not
consistent and the effect sizes were usually small. The most
surprisingfindingwasthatclozapinewasnotsignificantlymore
efficacious than most other drugs.
Clozapine’
s superiority was originally demonstrated in a
pivotal study5,6 in which it was clearly superior to chlorproma-
zineintreatment-resistantschizophrenia.Althoughsomesub-
sequent comparisons with FGAs were also statistically
significant8,92 and although the superiority to FGAs has been
confirmed by meta-analyses,9-11 the effect size of the original
study by Kane et al5,6 (−0.88) has never been replicated.
Figure 5 presents the results of all single-comparison cloza-
pinetrials5-8,53,56-70andillustratesthat,of21comparisons,only
2oldstudiescomparedwithchlorpromazine,5,6,531studycom-
pared with haloperidol,8 and 1 study compared with
risperidone56 showed a significant superiority; thus, the fail-
ure to find clozapine superior is not an artifact of NMA. The 2
old studies5,6,53 led to a high inconsistency in the NMA, vio-
lating a key assumption of the method. We speculate that the
inconsistency is in part owing to cohort effects in terms of the
periods when these studies were performed because some evi-
dence suggests that the clinical trial quality of psychophar-
macologic studies changed significantly after 1990.89,90 This
finding is also evident, among others, by an increasing pla-
cebo response93 and smaller drug-placebo differences.94,95
Nevertheless, when all trials, irrespective of their publication
date, were included, results of the NMA did not substantially
differ (eAppendix 6 in the Supplement).
Owing to several limitations, our NMA is not definitive.
Clozapine was superior in 3 large effectiveness studies16,92,96
thatcouldnotbeincluded.Essocketal92publishedalargecost-
effectiveness study in which clozapine was superior to the
groupofFGAsinmanymeasuresofeffectiveness,butthestudy
was unblinded. Similarly, in phase 2 of the Clinical Antipsy-
chotic Trials in Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE),16 cloza-
pine was shown to be more effective than risperidone and que-
tiapine, but clozapine was the only open-label treatment arm.
In the Cost Utility of the Latest Antipsychotic Drugs in Schizo-
phrenia Study Band 2 (CUTLASS 2),96 clozapine was found to

wasunblindedandcomparisonswithindividualSGAswerenot
presented. One could claim that, in open-label studies, expec-
tation bias could be a reason for clozapine’
s superiority, but re-
sultsfromreal-worldobservationalstudies97,98andpopulation-
basedregisterstudies99-101confirmthisfinding,evenregarding
hard end points such as hospitalization and number of inpa-
tient days. In these studies, better monitoring of patients re-
ceiving clozapine (eg, regular blood tests) is a possible bias.
Therefore, another possible explanation for not finding cloza-
pine superior to other SGAs is that patients who could benefit
from clozapine the most (patients with the most treatment-

of their study, clozapine was off the market owing to agranu-

cluded studies were conducted at a time when less severely
ill patients were generally enrolled in blinded RCTs, with more
onerous consenting procedures and commercialization of the
research conduct. Therefore, the criteria of treatment resis-
tance varied from partial nonresponse to high levels of treat-
ment resistance, and synthesizing this evidence could be prob-
lematic.Forexample,mosttrialsexaminingolanzapineapplied

chotic dose and trial duration as moderator variables did not
show any effect on treatment efficacy, but the statistical power
of these metaregressions was again markedly weak.105 There-
fore,thedosescheduleinclozapinetrialsandespeciallythelikely
underdosing in industry-funded trials could constitute a seri-
ous problem that could have affected the results.
Finally, results from a meta-analysis cannot be better than
those of the studies included. In our NMA, attrition and re-
porting bias were present in a considerable number of stud-
ies, and the issue of resistance to specific antipsychotics that
might be used subsequently as comparators in the included
trials (another form of sampling bias) could not be addressed
directly. In addition, NMA is a relatively new method that has
been criticized even more than conventional meta-analysis be-
cause it includes indirect evidence, which adds another level
of complexity and assumptions. Indeed, the trials in the net-
work were not as well linked (Figure 2) as in the previous NMA
of patients with nonrefractory schizophrenia.12 Enough stud-
ies examined clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and halo-
peridol, but, for drugs such as fluphenazine, sertindole, and
ziprasidone, the body of evidence was small and conclusions
on them are not robust. Therefore, more trials are needed to
provide clearer answers. Moreover, many other antipsychot-
ics, including SGAs, had no available RCT. Nevertheless, the
parallel that olanzapine and risperidone were also superior to
someotherantipsychoticsinnonrefractoryschizophrenia12and
even first-episode schizophrenia106 is noteworthy. In addi-
tion, the lack of statistically significant differences calls into
questionthehierarchiesfoundbytheNMA,soweprefertoem-
phasizetheeffectsizesbetweenindividualdrugs(ofwhichfew
were significant) rather than the rankings as presented in
Figures 3 and 4 and in eAppendices 9 and 14 in the Supple-
ment. However, the fact that, even in conventional pairwise
meta-analysesandintheindividualtrials(Figure5),hardlyany
significant differences were found clearly shows that the lack
of consistent superiority of clozapine is not simply owing to
methodologic limitations of NMA.
Conclusions
At present, insufficient blinded evidence exists on which
antipsychotic is more efficacious for patients with treatment-
resistant schizophrenia. Clozapine’
s superiority over the FGAs
has been demonstrated repeatedly, which establishes cloza-
pine as the standard treatment in this specific population, but
evidence from blinded RCTs for the comparison of clozapine
with other SGAs is lacking. Our analysis suggests that more
trials comparing clozapine with other SGAs in patients with
more severe illness and using high clozapine doses are war-
ranted. Moreover, the evidence on antipsychotics other than
clozapine, haloperidol, olanzapine, and risperidone is scarce,
and their results can change if further studies become
published.
