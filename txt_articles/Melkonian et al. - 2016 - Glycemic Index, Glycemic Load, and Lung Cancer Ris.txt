Abstract
Background:
Postprandial
glucose
(PPG)
and
insulin
responses play a role in carcinogenesis. We evaluated the associ-
ation between dietary glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load
(GL), markers of carbohydrate intake and PPG, and lung cancer
risk in non-Hispanic whites.
Methods: GL and GI were assessed among 1,905 newly diag-
nosed lung cancer cases recruited from the University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX) and 2,413 healthy con-
trols recruited at Kelsey-Seybold Clinics (Houston, TX). We
assessed associations between quintiles of GI/GL and lung cancer
risk and effect modification by various risk factors. ORs and 95%
confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using multivariable
logistic regression.
Results: We observed a significant association between GI [5th
vs. 1st quintile (Q) OR ¼ 1.49; 95% CI, 1.21–1.83; Ptrend <0.001]
and lung cancer risk and GIac (5th vs. 1st Q OR ¼ 1.48; 95% CI,
1.20–1.81; Ptrend ¼ 0.001) and lung cancer risk. We observed a
more pronounced association between GI and lung cancer risk
among never smokers (5th vs. 1st Q OR ¼ 2.25; 95% CI, 1.42–
3.57), squamous cell carcinomas (SCC; 5th vs. 1st Q OR ¼ 1.92;
95% CI, 1.30–2.83), and those with less than 12 years of educa-
tion (5th vs. 1st Q OR ¼ 1.75; 95% CI, 1.19–2.58, Pinteraction ¼
0.02).
Conclusion: This study suggests that dietary GI and other lung
cancer risk factors may jointly and independently influence lung
cancer etiology.
Impact: Understanding the role of GI in lung cancer could
inform prevention strategies and elucidate biologic path-
ways related to lung cancer risk. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers

Introduction
Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in
the United States (1). Smoking is the most well-characterized risk
factor for lung cancer and accounts for approximately 85% of the
population burden of lung cancer in developed nations (2).
However, evidence suggests that select dietary factors may mod-
ulate lung cancer risk. Factors including vitamins A, C, and E and
diets high in fruits and vegetables have been associated with
reduced lung cancer risk, whereas intake of red meat, dairy
products, saturated fat, and lipids have all been associated with
an increased risk (3).
The type and amount of dietary carbohydrate are the main
determinants of postprandial glucose and insulin responses (4)
which have been shown to play a role in promoting tumor growth
and carcinogenesis (5, 6). The glycemic index (GI) is a classifica-
tion of carbohydrate-rich foods based on postprandial blood
glucose responses, dependent on both the nature of the carbo-
hydrate and the type and extent of the food processing. GI
measures how quickly carbohydrates in food cause blood glucose
levels to rise after eating (7). Elevated blood glucose levels
stimulate the secretion of insulin. Insulin receptors activate sig-
naling pathways in the cell that are mitogenic, suggesting that
chronically elevated concentrations of insulin may influence the
risk of cancer through indirect effects on the insulin-like growth
factors (IGF). IGFs have been shown to play a critical role in
regulating cell proliferation and differentiation in cancer (8) and
there is evidence to suggest that IGFs are elevated in lung cancer
patients (9, 10).
Previous studies have investigated the association between GI,
and the related measure glycemic load (GL), and a variety of
cancers including colorectal (11–13), stomach (14–16), pancreas
(17, 18), endometrial (7, 19–21), ovarian (22, 23), prostate
(24, 25), and thyroid (26) but these studies are limited and
results have been largely inconclusive. To date, only one smaller
study has evaluated the association between dietary GI and lung
cancer risk in a case–control population in Uruguay (27). In a
large study of newly diagnosed lung cancer patients and healthy
controls, we investigated whether dietary GI and GL were asso-
ciated with lung cancer risk in non-Hispanic whites, and whether
these associations varied by known or suspected lung cancer risk
factors, including smoking.

 Department of Epidemiology at The University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center. Newly diagnosed, histologically con-
firmed cases who had not previously received treatment other
than surgery were recruited from MD Anderson Cancer. Healthy
control subjects, with no previous history of cancer (except non-
melanoma skin cancer), were selected from individuals seen for
routine care at Kelsey-Seybold Clinics; thelargest physician group-
practice plan in the Houston Metropolitan area. Controls were
frequency matched to cases according to their age in 5-year
categories, gender, and ethnicity. The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Boards at The University of Texas MD Ander-
son Cancer Center and the Kelsey-Seybold Foundation.
Data collection
All study participants completed an in-person interview by MD
Anderson staff interviewers to obtain information on a variety of
factors, including but not limited to, demographics, socioeco-
nomic status (education), history of hypertension prior to diag-
nosis or recruitment (for control subjects), physical activity and
smoking (including cigarettes per day), and alcohol history. An
individual who had never smoked or had smoked less than 100
cigarettes in his or her lifetime was defined as a never smoker. An
individual who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in his or her
lifetime but had quit at least 12 months prior to diagnosis (for
cases) or interview (for controls) was classified as a former
smoker. Current smokers were those who were currently smoking
or quit less than 12 months before diagnosis (for cases) or before
the interview (for controls).
Weight and height at diagnosis (for cases) or recruitment (for
control subjects) was recorded. Body mass index (BMI; kg/m2)
was derived from adult weight and height. BMI was categorized
according to the standard classifications of the World Health
Organization (WHO; normal ¼ <25 kg/m2; overweight ¼ 25–
29.9 kg/m2; obese ¼ �30 kg/m2). Participants also reported the
average number of times they undertook each of the five broad
groups of activities in the year before the interview. Activities
included active sports, physical exercises, swimming, walking
(including walking for golf), cycling, gardening or yard work,
hunting, housework, and other strenuous exercises. A metabolic
equivalent value (MET) was assigned on the basis of the energy
cost of each activity group (28). Energy expenditure from physical
activity was calculated as the MET value of each activity multiplied
by the frequency of each activity and then summed across all
activities.
We used a modified version of the NCI Health Habits and
History Questionnaire (29). The questionnaire includes a semi-
quantitative food frequency list made up of food and beverage
items and an open-ended section regarding dietary behaviors such
as dining in restaurants and food preparation methods. Portion
size was also queried. Total energy intake, total carbohydrate
intake, total fiber intake, and grams per day of consumption for
each food item were estimated using the USDA Food and Nutrient
Database for Dietary Studies (30). Total meat intake was calcu-
lated by adding total grams per day of each meat item in the food
frequency questionnaire (FFQ). All nutrient and food variables of
interest were energy adjusted for total caloric intake using the
residual method (31).
Because of smaller numbers of minorities, the large number of
GI/GL categories, and to reduce the residual confounding by
population stratification, the current analysis is limited to non-
Hispanic whites only.
Exclusions and eligibility
A total of 4,644 non-Hispanic white cases and controls had
complete dietary information for inclusion in the current analysis.
We excluded individuals with outlying total energy intake by
excluding individuals (N ¼ 158) with values that fell outside the
interval delimited by the 25th percentile minus 1.5 times the
interquartile range and the 75th percentile plus 1.5 times the
interquartile range based on the distribution of energy intake in
the population, by gender. Individuals with missing BMI were
excluded from the analysis as the distribution of missing data was
not even among cases and controls (N ¼ 168). A total of 4,318
individuals were included in the current analysis (1,905 cases and
2,413 controls).
GI/load calculations
We derived GI values according to a method previously
described (32, 33). Briefly, using published GI values compiled
by Foster-Powell and colleagues (32), we linked GI values (using a
scale in which the GI for pure glucose ¼ 100) to each of the
individual foods in the FFQ. The overall GL was calculated by
taking the product of the carbohydrate content of a given food
item bythe quantity ofthat food item consumed per day and its GI
value and then summing the values for all food items. The overall
GI, which reflects the average quality of carbohydrate consumed,
was calculated by dividing the total GL by total daily carbohydrate
consumption. We also calculated total GI using total available
carbohydrate (GIac), which was calculated using the same formula
for GI, but by subtracting the fiber values from the carbohydrate
values used in the GI calculations. GI exposures were energy-
adjusted using the residual method (31).
Statistical analysis
Physical activity levels (METs) and alcohol intake were cate-
gorized into tertiles based on the distribution in control subjects.
Missing physical activity was consistent between cases and con-
trols and therefore coded as a separate "unknown" category.
Analyses limited to only the sample with complete physical
activity information were consistent with the overall findings.
Smoking status was categorized according to pack-years, calcu-
lated as the number of cigarettes per day multiplied by the number
of years smoking, into the following categories: never smoker,
former smoker <20 pack-years, former smoker � 20 pack-years,
current smoker < 20 pack-years, and current smoker � 20 pack-
years. We additionally created a more granular categorization of
smoking (never smoker, former smoker <10 pack-years, former
smoker 10–20 pack-years, former smoker � 20 pack-years, current
smoker < 10 pack-years, current smoking 10–20 pack-years, and
current smoker � 20 pack-years) which yielded consistent results
(not shown). Alcohol consumption was adjusted for total caloric
intake using the residual method and divided into tertiles based
on the distribution in the controls for males and females sepa-
rately. GI and GL exposures were categorized into quintiles based
on the distribution among the controls and by gender with the
reference group comprised of individuals in the lowest category of
intake.
Comparisons for case–control characteristics were performed
using the Pearson c2 test for categorical variables and Student t
tests for continuous variables. Unconditional logistic regression
was used to calculate OR and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for
the association between quintiles of GI and GL and lung cancer

 risk [overall and separately for two major histologic subtypes,
adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)]. In
calculating ORs and 95% CIs, we used two modeling approaches.
In the first (minimally adjusted) model, we included age, gender,
education (<12 years, 12–15 years, 16þ years), and smoking
status. Matching variables were retained in these models to
account for the possibility of residual confounding.
In the second approach (the fully adjusted model), we
additionally controlled for variables that were considered bio-
logically and statistically relevant in the multivariable model.
Variables were retained if they improved the fit and predictive
power of the model and were statistically significant by the
likelihood ratio test. The variables included physical activity
(tertiles), BMI (WHO categories), total caloric intake (contin-
uous), alcohol intake (tertiles), total meat intake (energy-
adjusted continuous), and fiber intake (energy-adjusted con-
tinuous). Alcohol intake, meat intake, and fiber intake were
removed from the final model because they were not associated
with lung cancer risk. Tests for trend were obtained by including
an ordinal exposure variable in the model.
Stratified analyses for overall lung cancer risk were conducted
by smoking status (never/ever), gender, years of education (<12,
12þ), age (<60, 60þ), and BMI (normal vs. overweight and
obese). Multiplicative interaction was assessed by including the
cross-product term of dichotomous variable with the GI/GL
exposure in the logistic regression model. Statistical significance
was determined using the Wald statistic. We subsequently ran a
sensitivity analysis on a dataset further matched on smoking
status. Results of this analysis were qualitatively similar to the
overall findings and are presented in the Supplementary

version 13.0 (Stata Corp).
Results
Participant characteristics are described in Table 1. Cases were
more likely to smoke, be heavier smokers and had lower BMI,
physical activity levels, and years of education (P < 0.001 each).
Cases had higher daily values for both GI variables (P < 0.001 for
each), lower total carbohydrate intake grams per day (marginally
significant P ¼ 0.06), and lower fiber intake (P < 0.001).
Minimally and fully adjusted results for the association
between GI and GL variables and lung cancer risk (overall, AC,
and SCC) are presented in Table 2. GL was not associated with
lung cancer risk in any model. Higher GI and GIac were signifi-
cantly associated with an increased risk of lung cancer overall (GI
5th vs. 1st quintile, fully adjusted OR ¼ 1.49; 95% CI, 1.21–1.83;
Ptrend < 0.001; GIac 5th vs. 1st quintile, fully adjusted OR ¼ 1.48;
95% CI, 1.20–1.81; Ptrend ¼ 0.001). GIac was marginally signif-
icantly associated with AC risk (GIac 5th vs. 1st quintile, fully
adjusted OR ¼ 1.31; 95% CI, 1.02–1.67; Ptrend ¼ 0.08). GI and
GIac were significantly associated with SCC risk (GI 5th vs. 1st
quintile, fully adjusted OR ¼ 1.92; 95% CI, 1.30–2.83; Ptrend <
0.001; GIac 5th vs. 1st quintile, fully adjusted OR ¼ 1.92; 95% CI,
1.31–2.82; Ptrend <0.001), with more pronounced effect estimates
for SCCs compared with ACs.
Analyses stratified by age, gender, education, smoking status,
and BMI were also conducted (Table 3). Effect estimates for GL,
GI, and GIac were more pronounced for never smokers compared
with ever smokers (GL 5th vs. 1st quintile; never smokers OR ¼
1.81; 95% CI, 1.11–2.93; Ptrend ¼ 0.02 vs. ever smokers OR ¼ 1.01;
95% CI, 0.80–1.26; Ptrend ¼ 0.94, GI 5th vs. 1st quintile; never

¼ 0.001 vs. ever smokers OR ¼ 1.36; 95% CI, 1.08–1.71; Ptrend ¼
0.01). A significant interaction was observed between GL and
smoking status (Pinteraction ¼ 0.04).

Discussion
This is only the second study to suggest an independent
association between GI and lung cancer risk and the first study
to suggest that GI may influence lung cancer risk more profoundly
in specific subgroups, including never smokers, individuals with
low levels of education (<12 years), and those diagnosed with
certain histologic subtypes of lung cancer, specifically SCC. In this
case–control study, we observed a 49% increased risk of lung
cancer associated with daily GI with consistent findings for GIac.
Results for the two major histologic subtypes were consistent;
however, more pronounced effects were observed between GI and
SCC and between GL/GI and lung cancer risk in never smokers. In
addition, we observed significant interactions between high GL,
GI, and GIac and education.
A previous case–control study of 463 cases and 465 controls
conducted in Uruguay found that GI and sucrose-to-dietary fiber
ratio were significantly associated with lung cancer risk (OR ¼
2.77; 95% CI, 1.28–5.97 and OR ¼ 1.77; 95% CI, 1.11–2.83,
respectively; ref. 27). Although the associations between GI and
GL have not been extensively studied with regards to lung cancer
risk, previous studies of the association between these factors and
other cancers have suggested a role for increased dietary GI and GL
in cancer etiology.
Diets high in GI result in higher levels of blood glucose and
insulin, which promote glucose intolerance, insulin resistance,
and hyperinsulinemia (5, 6, 8). Insulin resistance is a pathologic
condition, and previous studies suggest that insulin resistance is
associated with abnormally high levels of growth factors, adipo-
kines, reactive oxygen species, adhesion factors, and proinflam-
matory cytokines, all of which have been associated with neo-
plastic tissue survival and cancer stem cell development (34–36).
Circulating levels of insulin have also been associated with a
variety of different cancers (37) and may modulate cancer risk via
perturbations in the IGF axis.
The IGF system is an integral part of growth regulation by the
body and abnormalities in all levels of the IGF system have been
implicated in carcinogenesis and cellular transformation (38, 39).
IGFs, such as IGF-1, play a pivotal role in regulating cell prolif-
eration, differentiation, and apoptosis. IGF-binding proteins nor-
mally inhibit the action of IGFs by blocking the binding of IGFs to
their receptor (10). Lower levels of these binding proteins have

 also been associated with increased cancer risk (40). In a previous
case–control study of 204 histologically confirmed primary lung
cancer patients and 218 control subjects, higher plasma levels of
IGF-I and lower levels of IGFBP-3, an IGF-binding protein, were
associated with an increased risk of lung cancer that persisted after
adjustment for age, gender, BMI, smoking status, race, and family
history of any cancer (10). This study also showed a significant
dose–response relationship between levels of plasma IGF-1 and
lung cancer risk. Results from animal experiments and cell cul-
tures studies also suggest that IGF-1 is a potent mitogen for a
variety of cancer cells including breast, prostate, lung, colon, and
liver cells (41). The evidence for the association between the IGF
system and lung cancer is inconsistent, however, with several
studies suggesting a null association (42, 43). Further research is
necessary to understand the underlying mechanisms linking GI/
load, the insulin-like growth factor axis, and lung cancer risk in
human populations.
The stratified analyses by smoking status showed a more
profound, independent association between dietary GI and lung
cancer risk in individuals without traditional lung cancer risk
factors (i.e., smoking). Smoking is the most important risk factor
for most lung cancers, therefore, it stands to reason that among
smokers, GI might not play an overwhelming role in lung cancer
risk. We did find, however, that smokers with high dietary GI had
slightly larger effect estimates compared with smokers with low GI
in the joint effects analysis (Fig. 1). Stratified analyses by other
factors, such as years of education and histologic subtype, suggest
possible joint or modifying effects between these risk factors and
GI. Educational attainment is a proxy for socioeconomic status
which has been linked with poor diet quality (including high
intake of simple sugars and reduced intake of fiber) in various
studies (44–46). Socioeconomic status is also closely linked with
smoking behavior (47), therefore the associations between GI and
lung cancer risk in individuals with less than 12 years of formal
education may represent the joint impact of low diet quality and
smoking on lung cancer risk.
SCC is the histologic subtype of lung cancer most closely linked
with smoking behavior (48). Previous studies of dietary intake
and lung cancer risk have suggested that the impact of dietary
factors, such as fruit and vegetable intake, on lung cancer risk may
be more pronounced in smokers and SCCs (49, 50). GI may have
a more profound impact on SCC via IGF pathways. Smoking has
been associated with expression of IGF-1 and IGF type 1 receptor
(IGF-1R), particularly in SCCs of the lung (51–53). In our study,

 smokers and nonsmokers differed by various characteristics (see
Supplementary Table S4) including histologic subtype and edu-
cation; 95% of SCC cases were smokers and nearly 50% had less
than 12 years of education compared with the 75% of ACs that
were smokers and only 35% had less than 12 years of education.
These differences are consistent with the existing literature and
could account for the differential associations between GI and
lung cancer risk in various subgroups (54–56). Future research is
necessary to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the interplay
between socioeconomic status, smoking behavior, GI, and lung
cancer risk.
The current study has several strengths. It is the largest study of
GL/GI and lung cancer risk to date and the first to be conducted in
a U.S. population. We utilized a large sample size of newly
diagnosed, histologically confirmed lung cancer cases and includ-
ed detailed data on many potential risk factors, including dietary
information from a validated FFQ. Finally, we conducted a
thorough analysis (overall, stratified, and joint) matched on
smoking status to address potential residual confounding by
smoking status and other factors.
Although this study provides the first quantitative assessment
of the association between GI and risk of lung cancer in a U.S.
population, there are several limitations that should be addressed.
It is a retrospective case–control study, meaning recall and report-
ing bias and confounding are important considerations. It is
possible that cases report their dietary intake differently from
healthy controls. For example, healthy controls are more likely to
recall healthy dietary habits than patients, leading to biased effect
estimates. However, it is unlikely that cases versus controls dif-
ferentially reported dietary consumption based on GI values.
Prospective cohort studies are required for estimating the causal
association between diet and lung cancer. Smoking has been
established as a cause of type II diabetes (57), and recent studies
suggest an association between diabetes, diabetic medication
(such as metformin), and lung cancer risk (58–61). Information
regarding diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease were not
collected within the scope of the current study until recently, and
we do not currently have information regarding diabetic medi-
cation. Given the link between high GI diets (via insulin) and
diabetes, this association warrants further attention in future
studies. In addition, FFQs are subject to random and systematic
error and are therefore not believed to accurately measure indi-
vidual dietary intake, but rather, rank individuals well based on
their relative intake. It is also possible that the association between
GI and lung cancer varies by race and that the results of the current
study, limited to non-Hispanic whites, are not generalizable to
other ethnic or racial subgroups. This study provides additional
evidence that diet may, independently and jointly with other risk
factors, impact lung cancer etiology. Further research is necessary
to understand the exact underlying mechanism for the association
between dietary GI and lung cancer risk.
