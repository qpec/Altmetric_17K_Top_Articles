Abstract  
The WHO Child and Adolescent Mental Health Atlas published in 2005 reported that 
Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in Europe to differ substantially 
in their architecture and functioning. We aimed to evaluate in detail the current 
characteristics of CAMHS at national level across Europe, including legal aspects of 
adolescent care. We carried out an online mapping survey of all 28 EU countries, aimed at 
expert(s) in each country. We obtained data for all 28 countries. The characteristics and 
activities of CAMHS varied considerably between the 28 EU member states (i.e. availabilty 
of services, inpatient beds, and clinicians; organization and delivery of specific CAMHS 
services and treatments), as well as CAMHS funding sources and users access. 
Neurodevelopmental disorders were the most frequent diagnostic group for people seen 
at CAMHS (data available from only 46% (N=13) of the responding countries). 70% (N=20) 
of the 28 countries reported having an official national child and adolescent mental health 
policy, covering young people until their official age of transition to adulthood. The 
heterogeneity in resource allocation does not seem to match epidemiological burden. A 
marked improvement in the planning, monitoring, and delivery of mental health services 
for children and adolescents is needed.  
 
Key words: child and adolescent mental health services, youth mental health, Europe 
 
 
SEARCH STRATEGY (panel) 
We searched PubMed from January 4, 2015 until January 15, 2015, using no language 
restrictions, for studies mapping the characteristics of CAMHS across European countries. 
Search terms were combined with MeSH terms: "Child and Adolescent Mental Health"[All 
Fields] AND "survey"[All Fields] AND "Europe"[All Fields], CAMHS[All Fields] AND 
("europe"[MeSH 
Terms] 
OR 
"europe"[All 
Fields]) 
AND 
("surveys 
and 
questionnaires"[MeSH Terms] OR ("surveys"[All Fields] AND "questionnaires"[All Fields]) 
OR "surveys and questionnaires"[All Fields] OR "survey"[All Fields]), "Child and 
Adolescent mental health"[All Fields] AND "service"[All Fields] AND "policy"[All Fields]. 
We excluded studies focusing on treatment of specific disorders, case studies, treatment 
methods, service user satisfaction, or clinical outcomes. To be included an article had to 
contain quantitative information on CAMHS-related policy or organization. We identified 
11 papers on CAMHS organization and characteristics at a national level, three in Europe 
(Italy, England, Belgium) and eight outside Europe (Uganda, China, Cambodia, South 
Africa – two papers-,  India, United States, Canada). We found no articles presenting or 
comparing CAMHS-related quantitative data at a European level.

INTRODUCTION 
Transition to adulthood is the period of onset of most serious mental disorders that disable 
or kill in adult life. Three-quarters of adult mental disorders have an onset before the age 
of 25 years, and up to 50% before the age of 16 years.1 Eight of the ten main causes of 
disability in young people aged 10–24 years are psychiatric and behavioural in nature.2 
Early intervention can reduce the severity and persistence of these disorders and lead to 
more favourable outcomes. 3-5 Initiation of treatment is, however, often delayed until 
several years after onset, resulting in potentially avoidable disease burden.6,7 
Access to child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) remains difficult, owing 
to a large discrepancy between the number of young people needing help and the 
availability of resources, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries.8 As for 
general medical care, there is a clear distinction between services for children or 
adolescents and those for adults, with a nationally set age of transition. Profound 
conceptual, clinical, and ideological differences exist between CAMHS and adult mental 
health services,9,10 which impede continuity of care for young people.11 McGorry has 
pointed out that this interface is “the weakest link in a system where it should be most robust”.12 
The most recent source of international data on country resources for CAMHS is the WHO 
Child and Adolescent Mental Health Atlas13,14, published in 2005. This global initiative 
provided systematic information on 66 countries across five continents; in Europe, 25 
countries were covered (including Iceland, Israel, Russian federation, Turkey and 
Uzbekistan). No subsequent studies have described CAMHS-related quantitative data at a 
European level.  
The MILESTONE project aims to improve transitions for young people from CAMHS to 
adult mental health services across Europe (http://www.milestone-transitionstudy.eu/). 
As part of the project’s efforts to map the CAMHS-adult mental health services interface 
across European mental health services, we did a survey of CAMHS in all 28 European 
Union (EU) countries, investigating service configuration, characteristics, and activity.

METHODS 
Survey sample 
We identified child psychiatrists and representatives of national child-psychiatry 
associations within each of the 28 EU member states with the help of WHO Regional 
Office in Copenhagen and the coordinator of the WHO Child Atlas project.14 In eight 
countries (Belgium, Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, United 
Kingdom), the survey was completed by the MILESTONE Principal Investigator or by a 
member of his or her team. Full affiliations of country respondents are presented in the 
appendix. Individuals were invited to participate by email: if no reply was obtained after 
three approaches, or we received a negative answer, we invited another expert. The choice 
of the alternative expert was based on suggestions either provided by individuals 
previously approached or by Dr. Matt Muijen, Dr. Myron Belfer and the MILESTONE PIs 
(SS, TF, AM, FMN, DPO, US, ST). 
Assessment instruments 
We adapted the European Service Mapping Schedule15 to create the European CAMHS 
Mapping Questionnaire (ECM-Q): this was designed to aid description and classification 
of mental health services and to allow the measurement of service use; it integrates many 
of the domains used in the WHO CAMHS Atlas.14 The ECM-Q was finalized (appendix 2) 
after multiple revisions  following internal review within the MILESTONE team, as well as 
taking into account the advice of external experts.  
A dedicated web domain was developed in collaboration with an Italian software 
company (Kema SNC).  
CAMHS was defined as a specialist, community based, multidisciplinary, mental health 
service delivering medical and psychosocial interventions for children and adolescents 
with mental health problems and disorders, or neuropsychiatric or developmental 
disorders within a specified catchment area with one Director or Consultant. 
Young people were defined as under 18 years or under the age of majority in the country 
in question. 
Data collection and analysis 
Each respondent was sent login credentials to complete the online questionnaires. Missing 
or potentially ambiguous responses were identified by GS and GdG, and each respondent 
was sent a detailed list of queries. Respondents were sent up to three email reminders to 
 5 
 
complete all sections of the questionnaire or clarify the figures provided. If we were still 
unable to obtain a response, we used data from the original submission. 
Total population and the percentage of young people below the national legal age of 
majority were derived from Eurostat databases16, collected by GS and GdG. 
Data were collated in Microsoft Excel 2013, imported into Stata13 (StataCorp. 2013. Stata 
Statistical Software: Release 13. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP) for cleaning and analysis, 
and analyzed and presented by JW and JG using appropriate descriptive methods.  
Role of the funding source 
The European Commission (FP7 program) had no involvement in the writing of the 
manuscript or in the decision to submit it for publication 
 
RESULTS 
Data were collected between October 1st 2014 and March 31st 2015, followed by quality 
control (from May 1st 2015 to September 30th 2015). We approached a total of 34 
individuals, and obtained responses from one respondent in all 28 EU countries. Each 
country respondents was free to ask collaboration to other national colleagues for survey 
completion (names are included in the appendix). Over 95% of survey items were 
completed. For six countries (Estonia, Finland, Malta, Romania, Slovenia, Sweden) the 
original completed questionnaires had missing (n = 20/28) or ambiguous (n = 11/28) data 
and no answer was received to our requests for clarification. 
The information was obtained from official national statistics or service reports (64% of 
countries, N=18/28), but also consultation with colleagues or experts (39% N =11/28), 
personal knowledge of the field (36%, N=10/28), and web searches (4%, N=1/28). 16 
countries out of 28 (57%) were able to provide references (eg, publications, websites, 
national reports) containing information about the organization of CAMHS or the 
epidemiology of child and adolescent mental health disorders in their country (see ECM-
Q, Q 10, appendix 2) . 
Provision of CAMHS 
Young people comprise about a fifth (average: 19%) of the general European population: 
Bulgaria, Germany and Malta have the smallest proportion of young people (16%) and the 
Republic of Ireland has the largest (25%) (table 1). Age of majority is 18 for almost all 
 6 
 
countries (89%, N=25/28), with the sole exception of Cyprus (17 years) and Malta and 
France (16 years). 
The number of public CAMHS varies considerably across countries, from 2 each in Malta 
and Luxembourg to 939 in the UK (table 1, figure 1). The number of public CAMHS 
relative to the target population ranged from 12.9 per 100.000 young people (Finland) to 
0.5 (Bulgaria). We did not collect information on how a service is delineated, so a service 
might be made up of many teams and work across a diverse range of settings.  
There is marked heterogeneity in terms of inpatient beds from less than 2 beds per 100 000 
young people in Portugal and Sweden to over 50 beds per 100 000 young people in 
Germany and the Netherlands (table 1, figure 2).  
The number of child and adolescent psychiatrists per 100,000 young people varies from 1.9 
in Bulgaria to 36 in Finland (table 1). The number of child and adolescent psychologists is 
generally higher than that of psychiatrists (except for Croatia, Czech Republic, Ireland, 
Portugal, and Slovakia). 
Most countries (25/28) have a juvenile justice system that in 64% (N=16/28) countries 
enables connections with specialized or dedicated forensic child and adolescent mental 
health services. Specialized educational services for young people are available in most 
countries : for mental retardation in 89% (N=24/28) of countries, for learning disabilities in 
86% (N=24/28), for physical and mental disabilities in 82% (N=23/28), for language and 
speech delay in 75% (N=21/28), and for behavioural problems in 64% (N=18/28). Only 
57% (N=16/28) countries had specialized services for deaf or blind children (appendix 3).  
Regarding the availability of specific facilities providing community outpatient child and 
adolescent mental health care, from 59 to 79% of countries  (N=16/27 -22/28) thought that 
the provision of public, or state-funded, group homes, respite care placements, day 
patients’ programmes, outpatient clinics, and health/primary health clinics was 
insufficient in their country. Private specialist services and foster care placements (of 
different types) are available in only half (respectively 48% and 54%, N= 13/27 and 15/28) 
of the responding countries. In Croatia, the Netherlands and Poland, outpatient care is 
also provided by non-governmental organizations (NGOs), by dedicated centres for youth 
and family (offering parenting support), or through community services (delivering 
assertive community treatment). 
 7 
 
Half of the (14/28) responding countries reported that CAMHS offer language interpreters 
for patients unable to speak the national language, either for diagnostic assessment (50%, 
N=14/28) or for care delivery (43%, N=12/28). 39 % of countries (N=11) reported having 
such services available only in limited geographical areas, while 4 countries reported 
having none for diagnostic assessment (14%)  or for care delivery (18%).  
CAMHS opening hours vary considerably across the EU, ranging from two hours per day 
in Estonia to 12 hours per day in Romania, from Monday to Friday, with a mean of 
approximately 8 hours per day (Mean=7∙76, SD=1∙8). Mobile emergency (24 hours a day) 
CAMHS teams are available in less than half of the countries (43%, N=12/28) or active 
only in limited areas (36%, N=10/28).  
Collaboration with other services  
Less than half (43%, N=12/28) of the countries had a national protocol or agreement 
between schools and health services for facilitating appropriate and timely referrals to 
CAMHS for children with suspected learning disabilities. 13/28 countries (46%) had no 
such protocols and in Belgium coverage was restricted to a few communities or areas. 
Most countries (63%, N=18/28) confirmed the availability, in most or all areas, of specific 
protocols for the referral of severe cases of abuse or neglect to mental health care providers 
by other community services (eg, schools, social services, other public and private 
agencies). Similarly, 70% of responding countries (N=19/27) had regular relationships 
between CAMHS and child safeguarding services in most or all areas. In terms of referral 
procedures, 16/28 countries (57%) reported the existence of official guidelines for referring 
patients from primary to secondary or tertiary care.  
Respondents from most countries indicated that there is at least one service user 
association (86%, N=24/28) and one family or caregivers’ association (96%, N=27/28) 
operating (or in existence). The degree of involvement of such organizations in the past 
two years in the formulation or implementation of mental health policies at national level 
(ie, participation in meetings dedicated to this purpose) differed considerably across 
countries, ranging from “rarely” (18% for users and 11 % for family associations, N=5-
3/28) and “not routinely” (39% for users, n=11/28, and 46% for family associations, 
N=13/28), to “frequently” (29%, N=8/28). In 14% of cases (N=4/28), the question did not 
apply, either because of the absence of national associations or due to the lack of specific 
national policies. 
 8 
 
CAMHS activity data  
A periodic activity report of CAMHS is obligatory in 86% (N=24/28) of countries (only 
Croatia, Germany, Luxembourg and Spain reported having no such requirement).  
Activity data were not available for 32% (N=9/28) of the responding countries, mainly 
due to the lack of national registries (presently available in 18 countries), or lack of access 
to such sources of information. 
The percentage of young people treated in CAMHS in the past 12 months (figure 3) was  3-
6% in 7 of 19 countries, 1-3% in 11 countries, and less than 1% in one country (Slovakia). 
According to the answers provided only by 36% of countries (N=10/28), the proportions 
of males being slightly higher (Mean 58%, DS=6%) than that of females (42%, DS=6%).   
The number of recorded new cases, for the last year available was provided by 13/28 
(46%) countries, and generally ranged between 0·2% and 2% of the young population. 
Less than half of the countries (46%, N=13) could provide complete data for every 
diagnostic category, DSM-5 or ICD-10 based, and one of them (Czech Republic) could 
provide 
no 
breakdown 
of 
ICD-10 
categories 
F80-F98. 
In 
all 
the 
countries, 
neurodevelopmental disorders are the most frequent diagnostic group for those receiving 
treatment from CAMHS. Information was not provided in sufficient detail to allow 
comparison between countries regarding specific developmental disorders. For some 
countries, more details can be found in the appendix 4-5). 
Policy and legislation in child mental health and child rights 
70% (N=20) of the 28 countries had an official national child and adolescent mental health 
policy, covering young people until their transition age. The age ranges mentioned in the 
policies for each country are listed in appendix 6. In two countries, the policy had been 
adapted in order to extend its coverage to a few years after the official transition age 
(Finland: 23 years; Germany: 21 years); such flexibility allows young patients to stay in 
services a few years longer after 18 years boundary if the treating clinician considers this 
more appropriate (i.e. eating disorder services). The key components of the policies 
include regulations on the types of health care provided and on the competency of care 
providers (covered by 63% of countries, N=17/27 replies), guidelines regarding access to 
services (59%, N=16/27), specific written standards of service provision (48%, N=13/27) 
and other matters, such as rights regarding consent and privacy (7%, N=2/27). Many 
sectors were reported to be involved in the development of policies about child and 
 9 
 
adolescent mental health, including mental health (64%, N=18), primary care (54%, N=15), 
child protection (50%, N=14), health and social welfare (36%, N=10), human rights (29%, 
N=8), and other social services (7%, N=2).   
All 28 EU countries have specific laws to protect children from abuse and exploitation. The 
majority of countries had formal procedures for informed consent (96%, N=27/28), 
confidentiality of health care services and records (N= 93%, N=26/28), and prescriptions 
of medications (n= 82%, N=23/28). Specific laws pertaining to the participation of children 
in experimental trials exist in 89% of the countries (N=25/28).  
National expected minimal standards of care for mental health professionals working in 
CAMHS were reported for at least two thirds of surveyed countries; 86% (N=24/28) 
reported that such standards exist for psychiatrists, 75% (N=21/28) for psychologists, and 
68% (N=19/28) for nurses. Standards of care include professional certification and 
maintenance of competency, in-service training, clinical supervision, and clinical practice 
guidelines. Standardized assessment of mental health services occurs in 68% (N=19/28) of 
the 28 countries: measures assessed include patients’ satisfaction (43%, N=12/28), clinical 
outcomes (36%, N=10/28), families’ satisfaction (32%, N=9/28), and other national 
requirements (32%, N=9/28), such as national accreditation of service providers, sentinel 
reporting systems, standards set by health insurance (ie, minimum number of staff, 
minimum staff qualifications). 
Health financing 
CAMHS across the EU receive funding through different channels (table 2). The most 
common source is government taxes (25/28 countries, 89%): in ten countries, this accounts 
for the majority (80-100%) of funding. Two other important sources of funding are service 
user families (68%, N=19/28) and social insurance, (61%, N=17/28) of countries. In about 
half of the countries, private insurance (57%, N=16/28) and NGOs (46%, N=13/28) play an 
important role in funding; international grants fund services in 6/28 (21%) countries. In 
Croatia, additional funding is provided by local communities. In all countries, families 
with a child or an adolescent with a disabling mental disorder receive subsidies or free 
government ancillary benefits in the form of exemption of all medical care costs. Other 
such subsidies or benefits include: access to specialized education programmes (96% of 
countries, N=27/28); provision of a disability pension (82%, N=23/28); access to 
institutional care (89%, N=25/28); provision of respite or practical help for caregivers 
 10 
 
(71%, N=20/28), and provision of training or education for parents (61%, N=17/28). In 
4/28 countries (14%), benefits include domiciliary care, rehabilitation courses for 
individuals and families, and financial assistance for parents or caregivers.  
Data collection and quality assurance 
Systems for collecting epidemiological data on child and adolescent mental health 
disorders exist in at least half of the surveyed countries, but only 10/28 (36%) could 
provide references for English language publications reporting detailed national data (eg, 
prevalence and incidence studies, service utilization studies, suicide rate studies, 
psychotropic drug utilization studies). 67% (N=18/27) of the countries reported the 
existence of a national data collection system for child and adolescent mental health 
disorders, but only 3% of countries (N=6/27) indicated that there is regular monitoring of 
treatment outcomes.  
Care for special populations 
In several countries, specific subgroups of children and adolescents have poor access to 
specialized mental health services dedicated to them: for example, only 37% (N=10/27 
replies) provide access for refugees, 26% (N=7/27) for orphans or victims of natural or 
man-made disasters, 22% (N=6/27) for seriously emotionally disturbed children, 15% 
(N=4/27) for minority groups, 11% (N=3/27) for runaway or homeless children, and 7% 
(N=2/27) for indigenous people. 33% (9/27) of countries have no special services designed 
to meet the specific needs of these subgroups and only 26%, (N=7/27) indicated having 
highly specialized services for fostered, forensic, or disabled children, children with 
autism or children who misuse substances.  
Pharmacological and psychosocial treatments 
For most countries,  all types of psychotropic medication most commonly used in CAMHS 
were available within their primary health care system (data from Malta and Estonia were 
missing): psychostimulants in 88% (N=23/26), and  second-generation antidepressants, 
antipsychotics and anxiolytics or sedatives in 92% (24/26), first-generation antipsychotics 
in 88% of countries (N=23/26), and mood stabilizers (eg, sodium valproate, lithium, 
carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and oxcarbazepine) in 85% (N=22/26), although in Denmark 
these medications are not available in primary care settings (prescriptions are authorized 
only if made by a child and adolescent psychiatrist). 
 11 
 
The most commonly available psychosocial treatments in CAMHS are family psycho-
education (88%, N=23/26), cognitive-behavioural therapy, learning assistance or 
educational support, and speech and language training (81%, N=21/26) (data missing for 
Malta and Estonia) (figure 4). Training or guidance for parents is available in 77% 
(N=20/26) of the countries.  
 
DISCUSSION  
In this first survey of CAMHS facilities in European countries since the WHO Child and 
Adolescent Mental Health Atlas report,14,17  we show a marked heterogeneity in terms of: 
(i) service distribution (beds, professionals, opening hours, dedicated facilities or 
educational services), (ii) CAMHS financing (public vs private sources), and (iii) users 
access (including new cases). Despite the overall (86%) mandatory requirement of periodic 
CAMHS activity reports, data on service activities were available only from 19/28 
countries, furtherly reduced to 13/28 for diagnostic group information, with 
neurodevelopmental disorders indicated as most frequent.  
Services and resources distribution 
We find variability in the numbers of child and adolescent psychiatrists per 100 000 young 
people. Between-country differences in service availability (table 1) appear to be more 
marked than those in prevalence rates of child/adolescent mental disorders18-19, 
suggesting that resource distribution does not match epidemiological prevalence estimates 
of child and adolescent mental disorders. Such differences are likely to be dependent on 
policy issues, distribution of financial resources, social, cultural and ethical attitudes, and 
the general architecture of mental health care in each country. For instance, the very low 
number of inpatient beds for children and adolescents in Italy reflects the very small 
number of psychiatric beds in general, 20,21 after the law leading to the closure of all mental 
hospitals and to a radical decrease in the provision of inpatient and residential care. Other 
countries, such as Germany, have a high number of inpatient beds across all types of 
psychiatric care (child and adolescent, adult, psychogeriatric, forensic).22 Some countries 
have other services such as intensive home treatment teams, psychotherapeutic facilities, 
or Flexible Assertive Community Teams,23 delivering almost comparable care in an 
outreach fashion.  
 12 
 
Marked differences were also observed in funding sources: in some countries all CAMHS 
activities are entirely publicly funded (i.e. Croatia, Italy, Spain), while in others, like 
Poland, a high proportion of CAMHS activity is funded through private sources. In 
eighteen countries, at least three quarters of CAMHS funding is provided by the 
government or social insurance.  
The need to use private resources (private insurance or paid directly by patient/family) to 
obtain access to mental healthcare may have, in our opinion, important societal 
implications for at least two reasons. First, having to pay for care may affect the 
socioeconomic wellbeing of patients’ families, by reducing their expenditure capacity on 
other essential goods and services. Secondly, accessing care only through private, and 
costly, pathways, may discourage families from seeking clinical support as soon as their 
child may need it, thereby removing any opportunities for early intervention. 
Several respondents to this survey noted that the provision of specific types of community 
child and adolescent mental health care in their own countries is insufficient to meet the 
needs of specific clinical groups requiring this type of care (e.g. respite care placements, 
day patients’ programmes, and outpatient clinics). This data input indicates to service 
commissionaires in these countries that they might consider the applicability of models of 
care delivered in other EU countries, as to whether they might improve health outcomes in 
their own.  
Current and future needs of care for neurodevelopmental disorders 
We found that most child and adolescent mental health care in the 28 European countries 
surveyed is targeted on children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders; in 
countries where subcategories were specified, autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) 
accounted for most of this diagnostic category. In many countries, adult mental health 
services do not treat adults with autism. This may be in part because the evidence base 
supporting effective treatments and services for adults with ASD is sparse24 or 
because adult mental health professionals do  require relevant trainng25. Such individuals, 
as they become adults, may not find any suitable mental health service for their care 
needs; 26 the exception being those who have psychiatric comorbidities. Clinical training 
and services policies should be reviewed to ensure that adult mental health professionals 
have the competencies required to treat adults with neurodevelopmental disorders and 
that adequate care is provided by adult mental health services.

European figures on CAMHS activities: problems and perspectives 
The percentage of  young people under the age of majority assisted by CAMHS varies 
substantially between different countries: although the high Italian proportion of CAMHS 
users can be explained by the specific combination of areas of assessment and treatment 
offered in CAMHS (child and adolescent mental disorders as well as child and adolescent 
neurological diseases), the high proportion of CAMHS users in Lithuania, the Netherlands 
and Slovenia does not seem to be justified neither by CAMHS availability, nor by 
differences in transition age (18 years for all three countries). 
In one third of sampled countries, respondents noted that the specific needs of children 
under certain special circumstances, e.g. refugee and asylum seeking children, children 
from minority ethnic backgrounds or those 'looked after' by government or local 
authorities (i.e. children 'in care'), were not met adequately. These responses can often be 
confirmed by other literature 27,28,29. This has important socio-political implications, given 
the recent increase in migration across the EU. Services should meet the specific clinical 
needs of new types of users: this includes being prepared to overcome linguistic barriers 
and offering specific and prompt assistance for those coming from war-torn regions.   
Finally, while governments support families with children affected by mental health 
disorders, mostly through financial channels (e.g. exemption of medical care costs) and 
access to specialized educational programs is overall guaranteed, parental training or 
practical support are not considered a universal benefit. Training courses for parents are 
not available in about a fourth of surveyed countries (23%; N=6). Considering the 
economic contribution of service user families and private insurances, families play an 
important role in the continuity of young patients’ healthcare. Governments should 
therefore consider how they might further support families and minimize any burden on 
them since this may result in better care for young patients, with a consequent saving on 
the public purse.  
All this underlines how the organization of services and the distribution of resources are 
often not based on users’ perspectives and needs, as it should be.30 Quality of care, as well 
as its continuity, needs full consideration of service users viewpoints as part of a process 
that involves multidisciplinary teams of clinicians, service users, and other stakeholders.31 
A combination of basic and clinical research might provide crucial insights to the 
mechanisms for improvement.32 Contact with CAMHS can favorably change the long term 
 14 
 
course of depression,33 highlighting the need for timely referral and a good compliance 
with services.  
Changes since 2005 WHO ATLAS  
Although differences in country coverage and methodology make it difficult to compare 
our data with those of the WHO ATLAS report from 2005, we can draw some conclusions. 
The highest availability of child and adolescent psychiatrists has increased from 18.9 to 36 
per 100,000 young people. CAMHS funding is now more reliant on governmental and 
public resources than 10 years ago, when in many countries services were mostly funded 
by private financing and international grants. National standards of training exist for child 
psychiatrists, despite existing country variability. 
Similarities between the two surveys highlight elements that have not been adequately 
addressed over the past 10 years: 
• paucity of systematic data collection for the assessment of CAMHS outcomes;  
• lack of national epidemiological survey data; 
• enduring service system gaps (i.e. considering the inter-sectoral nature of child and 
adolescent mental health service provision and the crucial importance of health-
based CAMHS’ collaboration with other services);  
• although at least one NGO related to child and adolescent mental health is present 
in each country, active involvement of NGOs in ongoing country level programmes 
is often scarce; 
• need for enhanced systematic data gathering and policy improvement to overcome 
mismatched resource allocation.  
 
Limitations 
Although we obtained replies from all 28 EU countries, not all questionnaires were 
completed fully, information on activity data was particularly lacking, with one third of 
countries not supplying this information.  
Caution is needed in interpreting these data, since information might have been provide 
based only on professional or local experience, and which might be inconsistent with 
national profile. We tried to minimize such potential lack of uniformity and reliability by 
using a specific definition of CAMHS and by seeking supplementary clarifications from 
the respondents. Additional strategies could have included: cross-checking the new 
 15 
 
information with already available information, using a more comprehensive glossary of 
terms and, gathering multiple responses for each country. However, for 15/28 countries 
information was provided by a team of respondents (belonging to the same academic or 
clinical group).   
The scarcity of standardized and valid data makes it difficult to interpret between-country 
differences or overall estimates (especially regarding activity data). Another complicating 
factor is that in some countries (eg, the UK or the Netherlands) services have been going 
through large-scale reorganization.  
 
CONCLUSION 
This paper provides important information for the evaluation and planning of European 
CAMHS. Differences have been highlighted. We do not suggest that a uniform service 
should be imposed on all country context, however, the data presented might highlight 
options that might improve services in countries that have not tried them. The survey 
highlights areas of concern: (i) poor service planning, discrepancies in resources across 
countries, and the lack of standardized outcome assessments for service provision or 
performance; (ii) scarce or variable involvement of service users and their families; (iii) 
scarcity of interdisciplinary CAMHS/adult mental health services. Clearer national 
policies are needed for service delivery and structure, and for standardized tools to assess 
the delivery, take up, and effectiveness of, treatment. Young people’s needs should be 
central to service provision, which requires improved understanding of their treatment 
experiences and their satisfaction with services. Professional training should be revised to 
bridge the gap between professional and service-related cultures.  
All these considerations highlight the need for standardized national data collection 
systems,34 using clearly identified and shared terminology, to form a holistic view of 
children’s and adolescents’ health and wellbeing and mental health services.  Addressing 
youth mental health needs in the most efficient and cost-effective way is part of the 
essential ongoing investment in adolescent health and wellbeing.35 This challenge implies 
an unprecedented reconfiguration of current service provision, as well as a harmonization 
of data collection systems.
