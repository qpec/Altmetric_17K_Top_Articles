Abstract
Community-wide awareness that ART provides protection against HIV has the potential to 
increase perceived safety and thereby increase condomless anal sex among men who have sex with 
men (MSM). Furthermore, reductions in condom use can increase exposure to sexually transmitted 
infections, which in turn can reduce the protective effects of ART on HIV transmission. The 
current study extends previous community-based behavioral surveillance research on beliefs 
regarding use of ART for HIV prevention and sexual practices among MSM. Anonymous cross-
sectional community surveys were collected from 1831 men at the same Gay pride event in 
Atlanta, GA four times over nearly two decades; 1997, 2005–2006 (the 2006 survey over-sampled 
African Americans to diversify the study), and 2015. Results indicate clear and consistent trends 
of increasing beliefs that HIV treatments reduce HIV transmission risks, reflecting the 
dissemination of HIV prevention research findings. Changes in treatment beliefs coincide with 
increased rates of condomless anal intercourse. Increased beliefs that treatments prevent HIV and 
increased condomless anal sex were observed for both HIV positive men and men who had not 
tested HIV positive. Results illustrate the emergence of an era where ART is the focus of HIV 
prevention and community-held beliefs and behaviors regarding definitions of risk create a new 
and potentially problematic environment for HIV transmission.

 Introduction
Antiretroviral therapies (ART) have revolutionized the treatment of HIV infection and ART 
is now used as a means of primary HIV prevention. For example, daily dosing of the co-
formulated antiretroviral medication tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine (TDF/
FTC, Truvada®) is approved for use as HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in HIV 
negative persons and is being integrated into HIV prevention services (Amico et al., 2012). 
Also of critical importance to preventing the forward transmission of HIV is the potential for 
ART to reduce HIV infectiousness when treating HIV infection (Cohen, McCauley, & 
Gamble, 2012;Pilcher, Eaton, Kalichman, Bisol, & de Souza, 2006). Following the results of 
a randomized controlled trial showing that early treatment prevents HIV transmission 
(Cohen et al., 2011), the focus of HIV prevention has shifted away from condom use toward 
detecting and treating those already infected (Forsyth & Valdiserri, 2012;Schwartlander et 
al., 2011). The impact of ART on HIV transmission at the community-level has also been 
observed in South Africa’s generalized HIV epidemic during the early stages of scaling up 
ART (Tanser, Barnighausen, Grapsa, Zaidi, & Newell, 2013). However, early observations 
have not translated to community-level reductions in HIV infections (Oldenburg et al., 
2016). The outcomes of one large community-level trial of administering early ART as 
prevention in South Africa demonstrated high-levels of uptake and viral suppression, but 
failed to show significant impacts on new HIV infections (Iwuji et al., 2016). In addition, 
HIV infections remain stable or are rising among men who have sex with men (MSM) in 
countries that have scaled-up HIV testing programs and provide wide-scale access to ART. 
Thus, the well-established potential for ART to change the course of HIV epidemics has not 
yet demonstrated significant reductions in HIV incidence at the community-level in major 
cities where ART is widely accessible (Matthews et al., 2016;Newman et al., 2015;Wilson, 
2012). Multiple factors may account for the limited impact of ART on new infections 
including large numbers of undetected HIV positive individuals, poor retention in care, and 
incomplete ART adherence (Fellows et al., 2015;Risher, Mayer, & Beyrer, 2015).
There are likely several factors that undermine the HIV preventive impact of ART. First, as 
ART transforms HIV infection into a chronic and manageable disease, the perceived threat 
of AIDS is diminishing. Second, as MSM become increasingly aware of the effects of ART 
on HIV transmission, individuals may reduce their motivation to use condoms to prevent the 
spread of HIV. For example, one in five men who participated in an online survey in 
Australia reported that they would be willing to engage in condomless anal sex with an HIV 
positive partner as long as that partner was taking HIV treatments (Bavinton et al., 2016). 
Finally, as condom use declines, individuals will more likely be exposed to other sexually 
transmitted infections (STI) which could increase risks for HIV transmission (Alaei, Paynter, 
Juan, & Alaei, 2016).
Shifts in HIV treatment-related beliefs over the course of HIV epidemics are associated with 
reductions in condom use and increased risks for other STI. For example,Holt et al. (2016) 
report that HIV positive MSM in Australia are increasingly more likely to believe that ART 
can prevent HIV transmission and that men who endorsed beliefs that HIV treatments 
prevent HIV are significantly more likely to engage in condomless anal sex. Similar changes 
are observed in MSM who are HIV uninfected, with beliefs that ART prevents HIV coincide

 with increases in condomless anal sex over time (Holt et al., 2014; Holt et al., 2016). 
Increased beliefs related to the potential for ART to prevent HIV transmission are associated 
with reductions in condom use in several countries (Laga & Piot, 2012), including Brazil 
(Hanif et al., 2014) and the United States (Kalichman, Eaton, & Cherry, 2010).
Research conducted years before there was evidence for the potential of ART to prevent HIV 
transmission had already demonstrated that MSM who held such beliefs reported less 
condom use (Chen, 2013). Studies between 1997, when highly active combinations of ART 
first became available, and 2006 showed significant increases in condomless anal sex among 
MSM (Kalichman, Eaton, et al., 2007b;Kalichman, Eaton, White, et al., 2007). These shifts 
in behavior occurred in a context of advances in ART used to prevent HIV transmission, 
including PrEP, and increasing beliefs that HIV treatments reduce HIV infectiousness. 
Similar patterns of association between HIV treatment beliefs and condomless anal sex are 
observed in both HIV positive and HIV uninfected MSM (Kalichman, Eaton, et al., 2007a). 
Thus, a pattern is emerging where increased awareness of the preventive effects of ART 
coincide with sexual behaviors that increase exposure to sexually transmitted pathogens that 
in turn increase risks for HIV transmission (Kalichman, 2008).
Previous studies of HIV treatment beliefs and condom use among MSM in the US were 
conducted prior to what is now definitive evidence that HIV viral suppression resulting from 
ART can directly translate to protection against HIV transmission (Crepaz, Hart, & Marks, 
2004). Specifically, in 2011 the results of a widely publicized randomized trial demonstrated 
that early treatment with ART reduces HIV transmission risks to nearly zero, ushering in an 
era defined by ‘HIV treatment as prevention” (Cohen et al., 2011) and the media coverage 
that has subsequently declared an end to AIDS (Park, 2014). The current study extends 
research conducted prior to definitive evidence for using HIV treatment as prevention 
(TasP). We examined community held beliefs about TasP and sexual behaviors among MSM 
attending the same Gay Pride festival in the southeastern US with cross-sectional surveys 
collected four times over 18 years. TasP beliefs and sexual behaviors were assessed using 
the same instrument at the same community event in 1997, 2005, 2006, and 2015. Here we 
present those four waves of behavioral surveillance data to examine community trends in 
treatment-related beliefs and sexual behaviors among MSM.
Methods
Participants, Settings and Procedures
Cross-sectional surveys were collected using venue intercept procedures that have been 
reported in previous studies (Kalichman, Eaton, White, et al., 2007). The same survey 
instrument and procedures were used to collect data at four time points; June 1997, June 
2005, September 2006, and October 2015. Potential participants were asked to complete 
anonymous surveys concerning health behaviors as they walked through the exhibit areas of 
a gay pride festival in Atlanta. For each year, we rented two booths in the exhibit area of the 
festival. Participants were told that the survey contained personal questions about their 
health and behavior, was anonymous, and would take 15-minutes to complete. In each year, 
greater than 80% of men approached agreed to complete the survey. Participant names were 
not obtained at any time. Survey respondents in 1997, 2005, and 2006 were offered $4 for

 completing the survey and $5 in 2015. In each year participants were given the option of 
donating their incentive payment to a local AIDS service organization.
Participants were 511 men surveyed at the Atlanta Gay Pride festival in 1997 (Kalichman, 
Nachimson, Cherry, & Williams, 1998), 473 men surveyed at this same event in 2005 
(Kalichman, Eaton, et al., 2007b), 449 men surveyed in 2006 (Kalichman, Eaton, White, et 
al., 2007), and 398 men surveyed in October 2015. As reported previously (Kalichman, 
Eaton, White, et al., 2007), the 2006 survey was intended to diversify the sample by 
including events targeted to African American MSM. It was therefore planned that the 2006 
survey year would be substantially different from the others in racial composition.
Measures
Participants completed self-administered anonymous surveys measuring demographic 
characteristics, substance use, sexual behaviors, HIV treatment beliefs, and treatment-related 
perceptions of sexual risk in relation to HIV treatment status.
Demographic characteristics—Participants were asked their age, years of education, 
income, ethnicity, whether they identified as gay, bisexual, or heterosexual, whether they had 
been tested for HIV antibodies, and if so the number of times they were tested and the 
results of their most recent HIV test. We also asked if they were exclusively partnered, 
defined as being in a relationship with only one man for at least six months.
Substance use—Participants reported use of alcohol, marijuana, nitrite inhalants 
(poppers), powder or crack cocaine, or methamphetamine in the past six months. Responses 
were coded dichotomously, Yes/No.
Sexual behaviors—Participants reported the number of times they had engaged in anal 
intercourse as the insertive and receptive partner, with and without condoms in the past six 
months. We also collected the number of sexual partners with whom participants had 
engaged in each behavior. Open response formats were used to reduce response bias and to 
minimize measurement error (Catania, Gibson, Chitwood, & Coates, 1990). Proportion of 
condom use during anal intercourse was calculated with the formulafrequency of condom 
protected acts / total frequency of acts. Measures similar to these have been found reliable in 
self-reported sexual behavior assessments (Schroder, Carey, & Vanable, 2003).
TasP beliefs—Participants responded to nine items assessing beliefs about HIV 
treatments, including beliefs about their effectiveness in treating HIV infection and reducing 
risks for HIV transmission. Items are the same for all years (Kalichman, Eaton, et al., 
2007b;Kalichman, Eaton, White, et al., 2007;Kalichman et al., 1998). Responses to each 
item were made on 4-point scales ranging from 1 = Strongly Disagree to 4 = Strongly 
Agree. For data reduction purposes, we replicated the varimax rotated principle components 
factor analysis reported by Kalichman et al. (Kalichman, Eaton, et al., 2007b). The same 
three-factor structure that was previously extracted emerged again the 2015 survey data. 
With all data across all surveys combined, we again replicated the same factor structure. The 
first component accounted for 32% of the variance in the analysis and included three items 
with rotated factor loading greater than .30; “HIV positive persons who take HIV

 medications are less likely to infect their sex partners during unsafe sex” (.735), “New AIDS 
treatments make it easier to relax about unsafe sex” (.776), and “It is safe to have anal sex 
without a condom with an HIV positive man who has an undetectable viral load” (.774). 
This factor was labeled HIV TasP beliefs and the linear composite (factor score) was used in 
analyses comparing survey years, partitioned by HIV status and engaging in condomless 
anal sex. Factor scores are interpreted asz-scores, with means of 0 and standard deviations of 
1, representing orthogonal linear composites of weighted items. Factor scores are therefore 
by definition internally consistent.
Treatment-related risk perceptions—This measure directly examined risk perceptions 
as a function of HIV treatment status by asking men to rate their perceived risk of 
serodiscordant receptive condomless anal sex, specifically risk during receptive condomless 
anal sex for an HIV negative male partner when their HIV positive partner has an 
undetectable viral load.
Participants were asked to respond to the following scenario: “Imagine that an HIV negative 
man has sex with an HIV positive man who is being treated for his HIV infection and has an 
undetectable viral load. Please rate how risky you believe anal sex without a condom is 
when the HIV negative partner is bottom (receptive)”. Responses were made for this single 
item on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 = Very Low Risk to 5 = Very High Risk.
Data quality assurances and statistical analyses
Surveys from each year were examined for inconsistencies and invalid responses which were 
treated as missing values (less than 5%), resulting in slightly different cell sizes for analyses. 
Comparisons of survey years were first conducted on demographic characteristics using 
contingency table chi-square tests for categorical variables and analyses of variance for 
continuous variables.
As a general framework, comparisons were made across survey years accounting for HIV 
status (HIV negative/unknown and HIV positive) and whether men had or had not practiced 
condomless anal intercourse in the previous six months. We first examined differences 
across survey years for demographic and HIV status characteristics using contingency 
tableX2 tests for categorical variables and one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) for 
continuous variables. Next, we tested for associations between survey year and sexual 
behaviors; condomless anal intercourse, numbers of condomless anal sex partners, and 
condom use. We conducted logit log-linear regression models to test the associations of 
survey year, HIV status and sexual behaviors, controlling for age and race. We included all 
main effects and 2-way interaction terms in the models. We treated these models as 
multivariable omnibus tests of association, with significant models followed by subsequent 
analyses between behaviors and years, partitioned by HIV status. In these analyses, we 
examined changes in behavior over time partitioned by HIV status groups using contingency 
tableX2 tests for categorical variables and general linear models for the continuous variable 
percent of condom use during anal sex.
We next examined differences for TasP beliefs and risk perceptions. As described above, we 
pooled the surveys across years and performed a principle components factor analysis to 
Kalichman et al.

 create a linear composite representing the TasP beliefs. We calculated factor scores for the 
first principle component that represented TasP beliefs for use in an ANOVA comparing 
survey years with HIV status and engaging in condomless anal sex included as variables in 
the model. Similarly, we used ANOVA to compare survey years, HIV status and condomless 
anal sex groups on the perceived risks for HIV transmission. All models controlled for age 
and race.
For all analyses of categorical variables, pairwise differences between survey years were 
tested by proportional differences and for continuous variables we used least significant 
difference tests. Non-parametric and parametric, tests for linear trends were also performed 
across the survey years. Missing data were treated as random and we used a complete case 
approach, analyzing all available data (Harel, Pellowski, & Kalichman, 2012). In addition, 
we tested for differences and linear trends across time points. Statistical significance was 
defined in all analyses as p < .05.
Results
The demographic characteristics of men who completed cross-sectional surveys at the 
Atlanta Gay Pride in 1997, 2005, 2006, and 2015 are shown in Table 1, which also shows 
that survey years differed along demographic. However, there were no differences in HIV 
testing history or HIV infections across survey years.
Condomless Anal Sex
Table 2 shows the rates of sexual behaviors for men surveyed at the four years of gay pride 
festivals. Logit log-linear regression models testing the association between survey year, 
HIV status and sexual behaviors, controlling for age and race, indicated significant omnibus 
associations for: condomless receptive anal sex,X2 = 14.2, p < .01; condomless insertive anal 
sex,X2 = 10.7, p < .06; total condomless anal sex,X2 = 12.8, p < .05; and number of male 
condomless anal sex partners,X2 = 63.2, p < .001. Similarly, the omnibus generalized linear 
model for associations with percent of times condoms were used was also significant, 
WaldX2 = 19.2, p < .001. Planned analyses examined sexual behaviors across survey years 
partitioned by HIV status.
There was a consistent pattern across years for both HIV negative and HIV positive men to 
demonstrate increased rates of condomless anal sex and increased numbers of sex partners 
from 1997 to 2015. For HIV negative/unknown HIV status men (see upper panel of Table 2), 
condomless anal sex increased from 43% in 1997 to 61% in 2015. In addition, 9% of HIV 
negative/unknown status men in 1997 reported two or more condomless anal sex partners 
compared to 33% in 2015. Across behaviors, the pattern of differences showed increasing 
rates of condomless anal sex, confirmed as statistically significant linear trends over survey 
years.
A similar pattern of increased condomless anal sex and numbers of partners was observed 
among HIV positive men (see lower panel Table 2); condomless anal sex increased from 
25% of men in 1997 to 67% in 2015, and the rate of HIV positive men reporting two or 
more condomless anal sex partners in the previous six months increased from 9% in 1997 to 
Kalichman et al.

 52% in 2015. The proportion of intercourse occasions protected by condoms among HIV 
positive men decreased from 82% in 1997 to 47% in 2015. The proportional differences 
across years, as well as the linear trends were statistically significant.
TasP beliefs and treatment-related risk perceptions
Figure 1 shows the mean factor scores for beliefs that HIV treatments are protective against 
HIV transmission among men who engaged in and did not engage in condomless anal sex at 
each survey year partitioned by HIV status group. Results comparing survey times, men who 
had and had not engaged in condomless anal sex and HIV status on TasP beliefs indicated a 
main effect for year of survey, F(3, 1829) = 6.3, p < .01; beliefs that HIV treatments are 
protective against HIV transmission increased over the four survey years. In addition, across 
all survey years, men who engaged in condomless anal sex were significantly more likely to 
endorse beliefs that HIV treatments are protective against HIV transmission, F(1, 1829) = 
9.3, p < .01. Beliefs that treatments are protective did not differ for men who were HIV 
uninfected and HIV positive men and there were no significant interactions.
Figure 2 shows the mean treatment-related risk perceptions for condomless anal sex when an 
HIV positive partner has an undetectable HIV viral load. Results indicated significant 
differences across survey years, F(1, 1829) = 32.9, p < .01; the perceived risk of condomless 
anal sex with a man who has an undetectable HIV viral load decreased significantly over 
time. There was also a significant main effect for engaging in condomless anal sex, F(1, 
1829) = 40.2, p < .01; men who engaged in condomless anal sex reported significantly lower 
perceived risks for HIV when a partner has an undetectable viral load. In addition, HIV 
status group significantly interacted with engaging in condomless anal sex across survey 
years and HIV status groups, F(1, 1829) = 6.1, p < .01; HIV positive men who engaged in 
condomless anal sex reported the lowest perceived risks and HIV positive men who did not 
engage in condomless anal sex held the highest perceived risks. However, there was also a 
significant 3-way interaction, F(3, 1829) = 2.8, p < .05; the differences between HIV 
positive men who did not and who did engage in condomless anal sex in 1997 were 
negligible and similar to HIV negative/unknown status men, whereas HIV positive men who 
engaged in condomless anal sex in 2005, 2006, and 2015 held the lowest perceived risks.
Discussion
The current study adds to the mounting evidence that substantial changes have occurred in 
community-held beliefs that condomless anal sex is safer in the era of HIV treatment as 
prevention. Across the 20 years represented in our cross-sectional surveys, beliefs shifted for 
both the view that HIV transmission risks are reduced when people living with HIV are 
treated with ART and for perceptions of risk conferred by condomless anal sex with an HIV 
positive man when his blood plasma viral load is undetectable. Treatment-related behavioral 
beliefs in this study paralleled a resurgence in condomless anal sex among MSM measured 
over nearly two decades. During that time, our cross-sectional surveys showed a doubling in 
rates of condomless receptive anal sex among uninfected MSM and more than triple the rate 
of insertive condomless anal sex among HIV positive men. Increases in men reporting two 
or more recent condomless anal sex partners were also observed for both uninfected and

 HIV positive men. Increases occurred incrementally and following a linear trend over time. 
These findings are similar to other studies that show increases in condomless anal sex 
among HIV positive and HIV negative MSM (Pantalone, Tomassilli, Starks, Golub, & 
Parsons, 2015). Thus, as treatment-related beliefs continue to shift in gay communities, we 
may expect further increases in condomless anal sex.
There is compelling evidence that under the conditions of ART reductions in blood plasma 
viral load correspond to genital tract infectiousness and predict HIV transmission risks 
(Cohen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, HIV infections among MSM continue to rise despite 
wide-scale treatment access and viral suppression (Matthews et al., 2016). Several factors 
can undermine the preventive value of HIV treatments, including treatment refusal and 
incomplete adherence. Of particular importance are local genital tract inflammatory 
processes that increase HIV shedding in semen rendering an individual more infectious than 
is apparent from his blood plasma viral load (Kalichman, Diberto, & Eaton, 2008;Pilcher et 
al., 2006). Thus, increases in condomless anal sex and exposure to STI will ultimately 
diminish the prevention benefits of HIV treatments (Jansen, Schmidt, Drewes, Bremer, & 
Marcus, 2016;Katz, Dombrowski, Bell, Kerani, & Golden, 2016;Payne, Lawrence, Soni, 
Llewellyn, & Dean, 2016;Sood, Wagner, Jaycocks, Drabo, & Vardavas, 2013).
The results of this research should be considered in light of its methodological limitations. 
As our study relied on repeated cross-sectional venue surveys, our findings are limited by all 
of the shortcomings of self-reported sexual behavior, particularly under-reporting. Our 
repeated cross-sectional samples were of convenience and cannot be taken as representative 
of any population, including MSM in Atlanta. In addition, our surveys were conducted in 
one US city that is experiencing significant increased rates of HIV infections, which again 
does not represent other cities. Our data also represent multiple cross-sectional surveys 
rather than longitudinal data and therefore cannot be used to infer causal relations. Several 
aspects of the HIV epidemic have changed over the time the surveys were conducted beyond 
HIV treatments and their use for prevention, any of which could confound our results. For 
example, during this same time there has been a shift away from HIV testing linked to 
prevention counseling to only using HIV testing to detect infections (Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, 2003). Also, new prevention approaches other than TasP are 
available, most notably PrEP that was not approved before the most recent survey time, and 
may have influenced responses. Other potential confounds not measured in the surveys 
include condom fatigue, changes in testing access, and the fact that HIV is no longer 
considered a death sentence. These co-occurring community-level changes may therefore 
account for the observed increases in condomless sex. In addition, we do not know whether 
TasP beliefs vary over time for people receiving treatment versus those not receiving ART in 
these surveys. With these limitations in mind, our findings have implications for continued 
efforts to prevent HIV infections among MSM.
HIV treatments offer great hope for curtailing new HIV infections. Universal access to ART 
has the potential to reduce community-level blood plasma viral load, which could mean a 
reduction in community-level infectiousness. However, to maximize the HIV prevention 
benefits of ART, increased efforts to control co-occurring STI are required. Both HIV 
uninfected and HIV positive sexually active MSM should receive comprehensive sexual

 health services that include routine screening for herpes simplex virus, HPV, syphilis and 
other pharyngeal, urethral and rectal STI (Mimiaga et al., 2008). Supportive services are 
needed to sustain increases in HIV treatment including transportation, drug assistance 
programs and housing. In addition, HIV positive men who are receiving ART should have 
access to HIV treatment adherence counseling in order to assure sustained viral suppression. 
In addition, while the CDC recommends sexually active HIV uninfected MSM to get HIV 
tested repeatedly each year, the recommendations for prevention counseling and other 
prevention services are no longer supported (Galletly, Pinkerton, & Petroll, 2008). In the 
absence of prevention counseling, which should include interventions for continued condom 
use and access to PrEP, repeated HIV testing represents an idle response for those who test 
HIV negative until the point they become infected. Reaping the public health benefits of 
ART for prevention will therefore require increased attention to resolving behavioral beliefs, 
reducing sexual risk behaviors and investment in prevention services (Holtgrave, Maulsby, 
Wehrmeyer, & Hall, 2012).
