Interactions among drugs play a critical role in the killing efficacy of multi-
drug treatments. Recent advances in theory and experiment for three-drug
interactions enable the search for emergent interactions—ones not predictable
from pairwise interactions. Previous work has shown it is easier to detect
synergies and antagonisms among pairwise interactions when a rescaling
method is applied to the interaction metric. However, no study has care-
fully examined whether new types of normalization might be needed for
emergence. Here, we propose several rescaling methods for enhancing the
classification of the higher order drug interactions based on our conceptual
framework. To choose the rescaling that best separates synergism, antagonism
and additivity, we conducted bacterial growth experiments in the presence of
single, pairwise and triple-drug combinations among 14 antibiotics. We found
one of our rescaling methods is far better at distinguishing synergistic and
antagonistic emergent interactions than any of the other methods. Using our
new method, we find around 50% of emergent interactions are additive,
much less than previous reports of greater than 90% additivity. We conclude
that higher order emergent interactions are much more common than
previously believed, and we argue these findings for drugs suggest that
appropriate rescaling is crucial to infer higher order interactions.
1. Introduction
Multi-drug treatments are an important tool [1–5], in particular, for combatting
bacteria that are highly resistant to the individual use of traditional antibiotics
[6–11]. The efficacy and efficiency of these combination therapies are substan-
tially affected by how the specific drugs interact. Thus, a useful categorization
scheme for interactions is needed that uses the additive case [6,12,13]—drugs
do not interact at all—as a baseline. Along with this is the concept of emer-
gence—effects of drug combinations that cannot be predicted from lower order
interactions among subsets of the drugs [14]. Relative to these baselines, inter-
actions are generally categorized as a type of synergy if the combination kills
more efficiently than is expected from the additive case or from lower order inter-
actions (figure 1). Conversely, when the drug interaction reduces the effect of each
drug, the interaction is called antagonistic (figure 1), which itself contains special
cases: (i) buffering, in which one drug completely masks the effect of the other
drug and (ii) suppression, in which the effectiveness of the drugs in combination
is weaker than at least one drug by itself [8,15–17].
It is a challenge to quantify interactions with a metric that has clear boundaries
between these casesand effectively identifiesand distinguishes between interaction
types. Overcoming this challenge often requires a rescaling or normalization of
basic metrics, and for pairwise interactions, some effective methods have been dis-
covered [8,18–20]. Rescaling for combinations of more than two drugs has
previously been done using themost straightforward generalization ofthe pairwise

 method [14,21], but unlike the pairwise case, there are several
possibilities for rescaling metrics for higher order interactions,
even among three drugs. Here, we explore these possible rescal-
ings and identify the one that is best at categorizing and thus
distinguishing among three-drug interactions. Importantly,
this particular rescaling method is different from the rescaling
previously used in the literature byourselves and others. Conse-
quently, this could reveal new insights for interactions among
three or more drugs, as well as other objects such as proteins
[22] and predators [23–27], and some existing results may
need to be revisited and revised [14,28].
For the case of two drugs, there are two common methods
to analyse and categorize interactions. First, Loewe additivity
categorizes the interaction based on the strength of inhibition
on bacterial growth when drug concentrations are varied
simultaneously [12]. When the same effective concentration
(relative to each drug’s minimum inhibitory concentration) of
the two drugs kill bacteria at a rate that is independent of the
relative fractions of each drug, the interaction is regarded as
additive. This Loewe measure is motivated by the simplest
case in which a drug does not interact with itself. Depending
on the direction of the divergence from this additive case, the
relationship is considered as either synergy or antagonism.
Second, Bliss independence (BI) defines additivity to be the
case when the presence of one drug does not affect another
drug’s per cent reduction of bacterial growth rate [6]. This defi-
nition breaks down if one of the drugs and the pairwise
combination are both lethal such that bacteria cannot grow.
Interactions are antagonistic according to BI when the deviation
from additivity (DA) is positive and are synergistic when DA is
negative [8,18]. BI offers a simple measurement of the epistatic
interactions because it relies on less data and its results are more
easily calculable and interpretable [17].
The DA measures yield a unimodal distribution around the
additive case for drug interactions. Because of the unimodal
shape, it is challenging to delineate boundaries and tease apart
synergistic, additive and antagonistic cases. To overcome this
hurdle, a rescaling method of the DA measure was proposed
in Segre et al. [18] for pairwise interactions. The rescaling nor-
malizes DA with respect to the pairwise drug fitness for two
reference cases: lethal synergy and complete buffering (i.e. the
combined two drugs have the same effect as the strongest
single-drug alone). This rescaled form of DA leads to an inter-
action distribution that exhibits three dominant peaks, with
clear spacing between them, hereafter referred to as a trimodal
distribution. For both simulated and empirical results, these
peaks enable a straightforward separation among synergistic,
antagonistic and additive interactions [8,18–20]. These peaks
are observed at the exact location expected theoretically.
Given that higher order (greater than 2) drug combinations
are increasingly being used to combat drug-resistant patho-
gens, it is important to have similarly effective, though not
necessarily similar in form, rescaled measures for higher
order interactions within a complex environment. This is a
complicated task, because effects at all levels—single drug,
pairwise combination, triple combination, etc.—may need to
be taken into account (figure 1). For example, a three-drug
combination could have interactions arising from the three
different pairwise combinations as well as an interaction that
only emerges when all three drugs are present. Recently, a
novel method to characterize and quantify emergent inter-
actions in three-drug combinations has been introduced.
Beppler et al. [14] present a framework that compares the
higher order interaction with expectations based on its lower
order component interactions. First, the direct extension of
the DA metric allows identification of three-drug interaction
compared solely to the single-drug effects [14,21,29]. Next,
the new emergent three-way interaction (E3) incorporates the
pairwise interactions in the model and determines the effect
of three-drug interaction that is beyond the effects from all
two-drug combinations. The generalization of the interaction
formulae for combinations of more than three drugs is fol-
lowed by the conceptual derivation of each metric, and the
special case with four drugs is provided in Beppler et al. [14].
Moreover, a recent numerical model by Wood et al. [28] used
maximum entropy estimation to predict the higher order
effects relative to single and pairwise drug effects for any
number of drug combinations. They showed that their numeri-
cal estimation is consistent with an algebraic expression that is
equivalent to E3 for three-drug combinations. However, our
emergent N-way interaction metric differs from Wood et al.’s
model in the sense that it quantifies the deviations from the
expectations from all lower order effects, not just pairwise
effects, so for four drugs or more, our model and Wood
et al.’s model will differ.
In this paper, we show that there are several choices for
rescaling emergent interactions and that the specific choice of
rescaling plays a crucial role in identifying interactions
among drugs. We analyse the previously defined rescaling
method—direct extension of the two-drug rescaling—of the
emergent three-way measure and establish new rescaling
methods that greatly improve the characterization of emergent
properties. These methods are defined by exploring possible
reference cases of synergy and antagonism that arise with
higher order drug combinations. Lethality always serves the
reference case for synergies as it offers the most extreme case
of synergism regardless of number of drugs in the environ-
ment. Therefore, there is only one simple extension of the
rescaling method for two-drug combinations for synergies.
However, for antagonistically interacting drugs, the definition
for the reference case of complete buffering could vary based
on the drug system and also the interaction metric (DA
versus E3). Because DA quantifies the overall interaction with

 respect to individual drug effects, the strongest single-drug
effect defines the complete buffering case as in the two-drug
system. However, for the emergent interaction, it matters
whether the buffering is defined relative to some subset or to
all of the lower order drug combinations (single drug, two
drug or some combination). Our new rescaling methods
cover the possibilities for the definition of the antagonistic buf-
fering, and our evaluation of these possibilities eventually
leads to enhanced classification of the emergent interaction.
To empirically study whether these different scaling
methods effectively separate the histogram for the metric
into a trimodal distribution, making it straightforward to sep-
arate synergy, additivity and antagonism, we selected 14
antibiotics and systematically investigated the effects of
three-drug combinations on the growth rate of a bacterium,
wild-type Escherichia coli. These data allow us to apply several
rescaling methods and hence to identify which method is best
at distinguishing among interactions for three-drug combi-
nations and emergent interactions. We further apply our
rescaling analysis to the three-antibiotic combination data
presented in Wood et al. [28]. We compare the original analy-
sis in the Wood et al. paper [28] with the new analysis from
our rescaling method. Finally, we present a straightforward
generalization of our new rescaling methods to emergent
interactions that involve more than three drugs.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Experimental details
2.1.1. Bacteria
The bacteria used in these experiments was the E. coli strain
BW25113, the wild-type strain (lacIq rrnBT14 DlacZWJ16 hsdR514
DaraBADAH33 DrhaBADLD78) [30] derived from the strain W1485
background [31]. A single colony was used to inoculate cultures
for glycerol stocks stored at 2808C. A single colony from this gly-
cerol culture was used to inoculate cultures in LB media (10 g l21
tryptone, 5 g l21 yeast extract and 10 g l21 NaCl). These cultures
were resuspended in MC buffer and stored at 48C. Bacteria for
experiments were grown by inoculating 20 ml of the MC stock
into 2 ml LB daily and growing for 5 h at 378C; 25 ml of a 1024
dilution of this culture in LB was used to inoculate into 975 ml
cultures for experiments.
2.1.2. Antibiotics
Antibiotics used include clindamycin hydrochloride (Sigma
C-5269), chloramphenicol succinate sodium salt (Sigma C3787),
fusidic acid sodium salt (Sigma F0881), erythromycin (Sigma
Aldrich E-6376), ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (MP Biomedicals
199020), cefoxitin sodium salt (Fluka C4786), ampicillin (Sigma
A9518), nitrofurantoin (Sigma N7878), trimethoprim (Sigma
T7883), tobramycin sulfate (Sigma T-1783), streptomycin sulfate
(Sigma Aldrich S-6501), gentamicin sulfate salt (Sigma G1264),
vancomycin hydrochloride (Sigma V2002) and doxycycline
hyclate (Sigma D9891). The dosage, mechanism of action and
abbreviations of these antibiotics are given in table 1.
2.1.3. Growth experiments
Antibiotic concentrations were chosen to reduce growth by 15–
35% as compared to the no-drug control (LB). These sub-lethal
dosages were first determined by testing a range of concentrations
for each antibiotic and were then used in all single-drug, two-drug
and three-drug conditions. Each triple-drug experiment included a
no-drug control, three single-drug conditions, three two-drug con-
ditions and the three-drug combination. In all cases, antibiotics
were added to the previously determined sub-lethal concen-
trations in 1 ml LB and inoculated as described above; 100 ml
was aliquoted into 4–6 wells for each condition in a 96-well
plate. These cultures were grown overnight for 18 h at 215 r.p.m.
and 378C. Optical density readings at 600 nm (OD600) at 18 h
were used to calculate growth rates as compared to the no-drug
control at 18 h by taking their ratios at this time point. This pro-
cedure has been previously used by us [32] and others [33,34].
Each three-drug experiment was repeated at least three times.
Data are represented as median, maximum and minimum.
Growth experiment data were also obtained from Wood et al.
[28], and methods for those empirical measurements are detailed
in that paper. Here, the Wood et al. [28] triple-drug combination
data (with non-zero concentration for each drug in the combi-
nation) are analysed using the exact same analytical DA and
E3 measures, calculations and cut-offs for significance (all these
methods are explained in the subsequent sections) as for our
empirical data.

 2.1.4. Definition of lethal
Lethal antibiotic concentrations are all concentrations above which
no bacterial growth can be measured. Experiments were per-
formed to determine the maximum OD600 measurements with
error that represent the lethal case. Bacteria for these experiments
were grown and inoculated in 96-well plates in the same manner
as described above. Three conditions were tested: LB only (no
cells), LB þ cells and LB þ streptomycin (STR) 9.2 mg ml21 þ
cells. STR 9.2 mg ml21 was chosen as an extremely high antibiotic
concentration that would ensure no bacterial growth, even when
the populations were re-inoculated in no-drug environments.
Thus, the LB only (no cells) and the LB þ STR 9.2 mg ml21 þ
cells conditions could be used to determine the error in OD600
measurements that represent no bacterial growth. The LB þ cells
condition was used as the positive control and 100% growth refer-
ence point. The LB only and LB þ cells conditions were each
replicated in 16 wells. The LB þ STR 9.2 mg ml21 þ cells condition
was replicated in 64 wells. After 18 h of growth at 378C and
215 r.p.m., the OD600 measurements were gathered. From these
extremely high drug concentrations as well as populations with
no bacterial growth at all, we obtained mean OD600 measurements
of 0.044 with an error of 0.003. In addition, we further tested bac-
teria populations at low OD, but above 0.047, to confirm that
those populations continued to grow (electronic supplementary
material, figure S1). Thus, all growth measurements below 0.047
represent lethal cases.
Based on the analysis of the E3 measure, we find that when the
three-drug combination and one of the pairwise combinations are
both lethal, the rescaled E3 measure identifies the emergent inter-
action as either antagonistic buffering or lethal synergy. This
situation is consistent with both definitions. However, unless the
three-drug combination is chosen to be non-lethal, the effect of the
third drug on the outcome is not obvious as the pairwise combi-
nation already represents lethality. For this reason, we identified
all such cases as inconclusive, which is consistent with previous
work on large drug interaction networks (e.g. Yeh et al. [8]).
2.2. Cut-off values for the rescaled emergent
interaction measure
Based on previous work [8,14] and the analysis of the resulting
distributions of [E3]R2 over all the drug triples (see Model Frame-
work and Results), the interaction is identified as synergistic
when rescaled E3 is less than 20.5, antagonistic if it is greater
than 0.5, and additive otherwise. For antagonistically identified
triples, we further choose 1.3 as the cut-off between the special
cases of buffering and suppression.
2.3. Model framework
2.3.1. Three-way interaction measures
In general, a measure of the efficacy of a treatment is how much it
inhibits bacterial growth rate relative to growth in the absence of
drugs. This measure is equivalent to a relative fitness for the bac-
teria that is typically denoted by wD, where D stands for a single
drug or a mixture of several drugs. Here, the fitness measures
are symmetric in the ordering of drug indices, for example,
wXY ¼ wYX for drugs X and Y. As discussed in the Introduction,
BI is when the per cent reduction in growth rate by a single drug
is independent of the presence of other drugs and is expressed in
an equation as wXY ¼ wXwY [6]. Accordingly, the DA is defined
by DAX,Y ; wXY � wXwY, with the general interpretation that a
large-enough negative value of DAX,Y implies synergy between
drugs, such that the combined effect is greater than would be pre-
dicted based on the single effects. Conversely, a large-enough
positive DAX,Y means that the drugs are acting antagonistically.
Identifying the existence of some type of interaction among
more than two drugs can be defined analogously (i.e. via genera-
lization of DA). For three drugs, the DA measure becomes:
DAX,Y,Z ; wXYZ � wXwYwZ, quantifying interactions at any level
that contribute to the overall interaction [14,21,28,29]. With more
sophisticated modelling and measures, it is also possible to identify
true emergence—the overall interaction is not just a result of inter-
actions among subsets of the drugs. That is, it is important to
distinguish between effects that arise from lower order interactions
(such as pairwise interactions that yield an apparent three-way
effect) and those that arise from emergent interactions that require
all of the drugsto be present to manifest their unified effect in killing
bacteria. A recent model that is capable of making this distinction
was introduced [14] and was termed the E3 measure.
The logic of the E3 measure is that all possible pairwise con-
tributions are correctly weighted and subtracted from the overall
interaction; hence it quantifies any triple-drug interaction that
does not originate from the pairwise interactions. The weighting
is determined based on the expected three-way effect when only
two drugs (pairwise interaction X and Y) interact and the third
drug (Z) is additive with them. Based on the three-way DA
measure, this would give an effect of wzDAX,Y because wZ
would factor from all terms and the remaining terms are just
the definition of the pairwise DA measure. For three drugs,
there are three pairwise combinations, so subtracting all possible
pairwise combinations yields
E3 ; DAX,Y,Z � wX DAY,Z � wY DAX,Z � wZ DAX,Y:
ð2:1Þ
Rewriting this equation solely in terms of the relative fitness
gives
E3 ¼ wXYZ � wXwYZ � wYwXZ � wZwXY þ 2wXwYwZ:
ð2:2Þ
Notably, this E3 measure includes every possible relative fitness
in the three-drug system. Both the E3 and DA measures are sym-
metric in drugs X, Y and Z and can be easily adapted to higher
order interactions that involve more than three drugs. More
detailed discussion of the derivation of higher order interaction
metrics can be found in Beppler et al. [14].
2.3.2. Rescaling three-way interaction measures
To easilyquantify theinteractionstrength and theseparationof inter-
action classes, the interaction measure must be rescaled. For pairwise
interactions, Segre et al. [18] established a rescaling method that
greatly enhances the discovery of antagonism. Their normalization
is based on two limiting reference cases for the synergistically and
antagonistically interacting drug pairs. The normalization factor
for synergy is defined by substituting the lethal case into the DA
measure (i.e. DA ¼ j0 � wXwYj ¼ wXwY), whereas the antagonistic
interaction is rescaled by the complete buffering case in which the
two-drug effect is the same as the fitness of the single drug with
the stronger effect (i.e. DA ¼ jminðwX, wYÞ � wXwYj). With this
rescaling the pairwise interactions yield a trimodal distribution
centred on these reference cases (modes at 21, 0 and 1 as expected
theoretically) and provides a clear cut-off between synergistic,
additive and antagonistic interactions [8,18,20,35].
To classify interactions among three-drug combinations, we
also need to establish an appropriate rescaling or normalization.
In particular, the reference cases for negative and positive
measures must be properly defined for each triple-drug interaction
measure. It is expected that there is a biologically and empirically
grounded choice of rescaling that will provide a clear distinction
between the interaction classes, as in the case with two drugs.
Moreover, as our rescaling measures are based on special cases
of the DA or E3 measures, they are symmetric by construction.
The case of lethality is uniquely defined for each three-
way interaction measure. On the other hand, buffering can be
defined in several different ways, and the choice of definition

J. R. Soc. Interface 13: 20160332
4
 may depend on the type of interaction measure (emergent versus
overall) being considered.
Because DA quantifies the deviations from the case that all
single-drug effects are combined additively, it is practical to
define buffering with respect to the effect of the strongest indi-
vidual drug. However, the definition of buffering for E3 is not
unique because E3 captures the effect of the three-drug combi-
nation relative to all lower order effects. Hence, buffering could
be defined relative to the strongest individual drug, the stron-
gest pairwise effect or the strongest of all of these. As a
result of this ambiguity, the choice of rescaling might cause
misidentification of antagonism. In the subsequent sections,
we first present
the extension
of the two-drug
rescaling
method to three-way interaction measures, and then construct
new rescaling factors that will help to more comprehensively
evaluate and characterize the emergent properties of drug
combinations.
2.3.3. Extension of two-drug rescaling method (Rescale 0)
Beppler et al. [14] and Sanjua
´n et al. [21] introduced a rescaling
that directly extends the method of Segre et al. [18]. Negative
measures are scaled relative to extreme lethal synergy such that
the triple-drug combination kills off the bacteria, i.e. wXYZ ¼ 0.
When the interaction measure is positive, it is scaled with
respect to the buffering case defined to be when the fitness
of bacteria exposed to the triple-drug combination is the same as
when exposed to just the single drug with the strongest efficacy,
i.e. wXYZ ¼ minðwX, wY, wZÞ. Hence, the normalization factor
(Scale 0, denoted by S0) for the positive E3 measure is defined by
S0 ¼ jminðwX, wY, wZÞ � wXwYZ � wYwXZ � wZwXY þ 2wXwYwZj:
Then, the rescaled E3 measure with S0 (Rescale 0) takes
the form
[E3]R0 ¼
wXYZ�wXwYZ�wYwXZ�wZwXYþ2wXwYwZ
jminðwX,wY,wZÞ�wXwYZ�wYwXZ�wZwXYþ2wXwYwZj:
Based on the discussion above, the current published rescaling
method [14,18,21] is the most appropriate way of characterizing
interaction type based on the DA measure and the synergistic
emergent interactions.
2.3.4. New rescaling methods for emergent three-way
interaction (E3)
To explore alternative rescaling methods that may lead to a
clearer identification of antagonistic interactions, we revisit the
possible definitions of buffering. Based on the buffering defi-
nition, the antagonistic buffering cases would be mapped to 1
via the corresponding rescaled metric. Note that the synergistic
interactions are characterized by the previously defined rescaling
method; hence rescaling methods presented here map the lethal
synergies to 21. All of the different rescaling methods are
summarized in table 2.
2.3.5. Rescale 1: buffering relative to pairwise drug effects
Higher order combination therapies of N drugs are analysed
relative to the lower order combinations (i.e. N 2 1, N 2 2, etc.)
of subsets of the drugs. Therefore, another type of buffering is
when the effect of all three drugs combined is exactly the same
as that of the most powerful pairwise combination (i.e. the
lowest relative fitness in the presence of any pairwise combi-
nation of drugs). Consequently, for antagonistically interacting
drugs (i.e. E3 . 0), we introduce the normalization factor S1 by
substituting the minimum of all pairwise drug fitnesses for the
triple-drug fitness in E3 (table 2):
S1¼jminðwXY,wXZ,wYZÞ�wXwYZ �wYwXZ �wZwXY þ2wXwYwZj:
Hence, the rescaled E3 measure (Rescale 1) is
[E3]R1¼
wXYZ�wXwYZ�wYwXZ�wZwXYþ2wXwYwZ
jminðwXY,wXZ,wYZÞ�wXwYZ�wYwXZ�wZwXYþ2wXwYwZj:
In this way, we can assess if any of the pairwise drug combi-
nations disguise the effect of the cooperation and antagonism
of the remaining drug in the triple-drug combination.
2.3.6. Rescale 2: buffering relative to single and pairwise drug
effects
In this section, we propose a generalization of the above S1-
rescaling scheme that accounts for all lower order drug components.
This generalization allows for the possibility that a single-drug
therapy might be more powerful and offer more effective treatment
than any pairwise combination (i.e. the lowest relative fitness in the
presence of a single drug is lower than the relative fitness in
the presence of any pairwise combination). This extension defines
theE3 measure relative to theminimum of thefitness values attained
by any single or pairwise components as (table 2)

 Thus, the new rescaled E3 measure (Rescale 2) takes the form
[E3]R2 ¼
wXYZ � wXwYZ � wYwXZ � wZwXY þ 2wXwYwZ
jminðwX, wY, wZ, wXY, wXZ, wYZÞ � wXwYZ � wYwXZ � wZwXY þ 2wXwYwZj :
Rescale 1 and 2 yield the same results if the minimum of the pair-
wise drug fitnesses is less than the minimum of the single-drug
fitnesses, which is frequently the case. Notably, Rescale 2 spans a
broader set of circumstances than Rescale 1.
We further note that it is straightforward to generalize
Rescale 2 when emergent properties with more than three
drugs are analysed. For the case of N drugs, the scaling factor
S2 is given by calculating the emergent measure by replacing
the N-drug fitness by the minimum of the bacterial fitness
among all possible subsets of the drugs. For instance, four-drug
combinations are rescaled relative to the case when
wXYZT ¼ minðwX, wY, wZ, wT, wXY, wXZ, wXT, wYZ, wYT, wZT;
wXYZ, wXYT, wXZT, wYZTÞ:
2.3.7. Rescale 3: buffering relative to effects from pairwise
interactions
Because the E3 measure captures the emergent triple-drug
interaction that cannot be explained by the pairwise effects,
we consider another definition of buffering to be relative to
the expected pairwise contribution to the overall three-way
interaction (DA). Note that based on the DA and E3 measures,
this is not the same as the relative fitness in the presence of a
pairwise drug combination because each of those relative
fitnesses is multiplied by the proper weighting (i.e. the relative
fitness in the presence of the remaining single drug). Replacing
the DA term (DAX,Y,Z) in the E3 expression (2.1) by the minimum
of pairwise interaction contributions defines our last scaling
method, S3, via
S3 ¼ jminðwX DAY,Z, wY DAX,Z, wZ DAX,YÞ
�wX DAY,Z � wY DAX,Z � wZ DAX,Yj:
Substituting the pairwise fitness measures into the minimized
quantity in S3, we obtain
minðwX DAY,Z, wY DAX,Z, wZ DAX,YÞ
¼ minðwXwYZ, wYwXZ, wZwXYÞ � wXwYwZ,
which is a symmetric expression in terms of the pairwise contri-
butions. S3 can be expressed purely in terms of the fitness
parameters as
S3 ¼ jminðwXwYZ, wYwXZ, wZwXYÞ
�wXwYZ � wYwXZ � wZwXY þ 2wXwYwZj:
So when the unscaled E3 measure is positive, we rescale the E3
measure (Rescale 3) as (table 2)
[E3]R3 ¼
wXYZ � wXwYZ � wYwXZ � wZwXY þ 2wXwYwZ
jminðwXwYZ, wYwXZ, wZwXYÞ � wXwYZ � wYwXZ � wZwXY þ 2wXwYwZj :
Because experimental concentrations of individual drugs are
chosen such that each reduces the growth about 15–35%, we
expect somewhat similar results as in the Rescale 1 because
we are simply multiplying wXYZ ¼ minðwXY, wXZ, wYZÞ by a
number between 0.65 and 0.85 (relative fitness of a single drug).
3. Results
To distinguish different types of interactions manifested in
triple-drug combination therapies, we use a newly proposed
emergent three-way measure [14]. To include as much infor-
mation as possible, we show all data in the histogram results
(figure 2). We observe that the unscaled version of the emer-
gent measure yields a unimodal distribution around the
additive case (figure 2a). We find that Rescale 0 which defines
buffering based on the comparison of the triple-drug combi-
nation with the single drug effects (previously used method
in [14,21]) results in a distribution with modes at 21 and 0,
hence identifying emergent synergies. Yet, Rescale 0 does not
result in a clear distinction for the antagonistic triples
(figure 2c).
Importantly, using the new rescaling methods we propose
here, we see that Rescale 2, which defines antagonistic buffer-
ing relative to the single or pairwise drug effects, successfully
maps (figure 2b) lethal synergies to 21, additive interactions
to
0
and
the
antagonistic
buffering
interactions
to
1. Consequently, the resulting distribution from Rescale 2
leads to a multimodal distribution with three dominant
peaks (see Silverman test results for multimodality in electronic
supplementary material, table S1 and figure S2). The distri-
bution of Rescale 2 without the inconclusive cases—when
one of the pairwise combinations and triple combination are
lethal—is given in electronic supplementary material, figure
S3. Although the peak at 1 is diminished when the inconclusive
cases are excluded, our main result still holds as the identifi-
cation
of
synergistic
and
antagonistic
interactions
is
enhanced. Note that the same result is obtained by Rescale 1
where the triple combination is only compared with the most
effective pairwise combination (figure 2d). This is because
the pairwise components in the analysed data are always stron-
ger than individual drugs. Moreover, in agreement with
theoretical predictions, Rescale 3, which defines antagonistic
buffering relative to the most powerful pairwise interaction,
yields similar results as in both Rescale 1 and Rescale 2. Nota-
bly, Rescale 3 leads to cleaner separation between the different
modes than the other choices of rescaling (figure 2e).
Via Rescale 2, we find 38 synergistic, 78 antagonistic buffer-
ing and 47 antagonistic suppressive emergent interactions
from 364 different triple-drug combination experiments. Of
the remaining combinations, 165 are additive and 36 are incon-
clusive due to lethality to the pairwise and triple combination.
Interaction classifications found via each of the rescaling
methods are summarized in the electronic supplementary

 material, table S2. In figure 3, we provide a comparison
between the existing rescaling method (Rescale 0) and the
newly proposed method Rescale 2 in terms of the identification
by each of the synergistic or antagonistic triples. We find
that the majority of emergent antagonisms (90%) are either
classified as additive or underestimated (buffering versus sup-
pression) according to Rescale 0. A comparison of emergent
interaction types obtained via the other rescaling methods is
given in electronic supplementary material, table S3.
We additionally give two examples of highly synergis-
tic and highly suppressive emergent interactions. First, a
triple-drug
combination
of
ciprofloxacin þ clindamycin þ
streptomycin yields emergent lethal synergy (figure 4a) accord-
ing to all rescale methods studied here, whereas such an
interaction is not apparent with the unscaled version of E3.
Next, the drug combination with erythromycin þ cefoxitin þ
tobramycin shows highly suppressive emergent interaction
(figure 4b) according to rescaling methods 1–3, while it
is barely identified as antagonistic according to Rescale 0 (pre-
viously used method) and is not even identified as antagonistic
with the unscaled version.
To see if we obtain similar results (e.g. unimodal distri-
bution from unscaled data, multimodal distribution using
scaled methods) with other datasets, we also analysed the
data from Wood et al. [28]. We find that the unscaled measure
for this dataset also yields a unimodal distribution (figure 5,
inset), seeming to imply that almost no emergent interactions
exist. However, when we apply rescaling methods to this
dataset, we observe multimodal distributions (figure 5; elec-
tronic supplementary material, figure S4) that are similar to

 the results from the analysis of our own data. The peak at –1
(corresponding to lethal synergies by definition) is not visible
for these data. This is due to the fact that the vast majority of
the data (93%) are coming from just six combinations of three
drugs that are varied in their concentrations to create a larger
set of data. These particular combinations and the range of
concentrations used result in either emergent antagonism or
emergent additivity for almost all experiments. These results
are consistent with previous reports that different drug con-
centrations
do
not
change
a
drug
interaction
from
antagonistic to synergistic [8]. Therefore, the data in this
study mainly represent the effect of varying drug dosages
for a small set of drug combinations, whereas our study
measures a much larger set of drug combinations and thus
analyses a much larger set of potential interactions and classi-
fications. Even for the limited set of drug combinations
studied in Wood et al. [28], we find our rescaling methods
greatly enhance the identification of interactions. Specifically,
we find only 53% of the measurements are additive with
the remaining measurements being synergistic (3%) or antag-
onistic (44%) emergent interactions, as opposed to more than
97% additivity reported by Wood et al. [28]. That is, the
choice of rescaling leads to dramatically different conclusions
about the presence and overall prevalence of emergent inter-
actions. Moreover, our new analysis reveals that the Wood
et al. [28] data also frequently exhibit emergent interactions
and that these interactions tend to be much more antagonistic,
and using our new rescale, different datasets yield the same
conclusions.
Consequently,
applying
our
new
rescaling
methods to different datasets (ours and Wood et al.’s [28])
yields similar conclusions about an increase in antagonism
for
higher
order
emergent
interactions,
suggesting
the
generality of our findings and the need for rescaling.

 measure is not useful for identifying and distinguishing among
drug interactions. We overcame this problem by constructing
new rescaling methods relative to natural reference frames of
synergistic and antagonistic cases. As a result, our rescaling
methods oftheemergent measureallowustoclearlydistinguish
interaction types via multimodal characteristics of the emergent
E3 measure distribution.
We have shown that defining antagonistic buffering as
the masking effect by the pairwise combinations (Rescale 1)
or by all possible lower order combinations (Rescale 2) lead
to nearly identical results. Intriguingly, Rescale 3, where buf-
fering occurs when the overall interaction effect is masked by
the strongest pairwise interaction, is somewhat similar to
Rescale 1 and 2 but yields important differences for categor-
izing interactions. The consistency of all three new rescaling
results gives confidence that the identification of the emer-
gent properties is well established. Among these methods,
we identify Rescale 2 and Rescale 3 as the best at categorizing
emergent interactions based on the distributions they pro-
duce. Rescale 2 may be more widely adopted because of
ease of interpreting from the fitness measurements, hence
comparing through standard bar graphs. On the other
hand, Rescale 3 may be desirable because it is more naturally
connected to the underlying formulation of E3 itself.
There
are
three
baselines
for
rescaling:
21
(lethal
synergy), 0 (additivity) and 1 (antagonistic buffering). Per-
forming a test of multimodality for the distribution of E3
with Rescale 2, we find at least four modes, with three domi-
nant ones occurring at 21, 0 and 1 (electronic supplementary
material, table S1). These modes suggest that our empirical
data do segregate into the three extreme cases upon which
our rescaling metrics are designed. Intriguingly, there may
be a fourth peak that could be a weaker form of antagonism
(see multimodal Silverman test in electronic supplementary
material, figure S2). This mode is consistent with features of
the pairwise distribution of interactions although that limited
dataset makes it difficult to see the peak [8]. As we obtain
more empirical data, this fourth peak and other characteristic
features of this distribution will be explored in more detail.
Applying the rescaling methods we proposed here sub-
stantially changes the existing results for the multi-drug
interactions from Wood et al. [28]. They suggest that most
of the interactions in the multi-drug environment can be
explained by pairwise and single-drug effects. However, via
the use of our rescaling methods, we identify substantial
numbers of non-additive interactions from the same dataset.
Hence, we conclude that for many combinations the higher
order effects are not simply the result of lower order effects.
These conclusions further strengthen the importance of the
choice of an appropriate rescaling method when identifying
higher order emergent interactions.
Our rescaling method enhances the mode for emergent
synergy (at 21) even more than the Segre et al. [18] rescaling
method enhances the mode for synergy for pairwise inter-
actions in a yeast epistasis study. This can be explained by
considering the differences of the fitness ranges for yeast
knockouts and drug combinations. The fitness of the single
knockout is typically very close to the wild-type fitness (¼1)
[18]. As interaction type is determined based on the compari-
son between single and double mutants, lethal synergies
(when fitness of double knockout is close to 0) are obvious
even with the unscaled measure. However, drugs at most
useful concentrations lead to lower fitnesses than those that
result from single-gene knockouts. Because of this reduced
difference between lethality and the single effects, lethal drug
synergies are not as obvious with the unscaled measure as
they were in the gene epistasis studies. Intriguingly, the rescal-
ing of the emergent interaction measure helps uncover the
strength of the synergistic interaction. Moreover, in addition
to the modes expected for synergistic, additive and antagonistic
buffering interactions, the rescaling for emergent drug
measures yields a substantial number of suppressive triples,
thus yielding even more useful information for classifying
drug interactions. Taken together, our new rescaling method
offers a strong and robust identification and categorization
scheme for three-drug interactions and very possibly higher
order interactions in general.
The identification of highly synergistic and suppressive
emergent interactions that we established in this study could
be especially important for antibiotic research. This importance
and clinical relevance is because highly synergistic triple-drug
combinations are of utmost importance due to the high efficacy
of
the
treatment
compared
with
pairwise
interactions
[1,36–40]. On the other hand, identifying suppressive inter-
actions may be especially valuable because it has been shown
that, counterintuitively, these interactions may slow and thus
suppress the evolution of antibiotic resistance [8,15,17,41–43].
That is, there may be a trade-off between killing efficiency
and the evolution of resistance. Synergistic combinations may
be especially good at killing bacteria but may also increase
the likelihood and rate of evolution of resistance [17,42–44].
Thus, this trade-off can also be seen as balancing the good of
an individual with the good of the public.
We note that it can be very important clinically whether
three-drug interactions are different from the expectations
based on all two-drug interactions. This is because an emergent
synergistic interaction would be a potentially novel therapeutic
option, whereas a three-way synergy that just resulted from a
pairwise synergy would not gain much benefit by adding
the third drug. Indeed, in such a case, the third drug could
be irrelevant in terms of killing bacteria, and thus likely
should not be used in order to decrease the toxic side effects
to the patient. This rescaling method will allow us to determine
if an additional third drug gives a real benefit. As mentioned
above, drug interactions can change the topography of fitness
landscapes, and this is important because ultimately, it

 would be very useful to design landscapes such that the bac-
teria would have a difficult time reaching maximal fitness
peaks with multi-drug resistance. Emergent interactions, as
opposed to DA interactions, could change the shape of the
fitness landscape more dramatically.
One caveat is that the empirical data are for fixed drug con-
centrations, so that BI is used to determine interaction type.
BI is a much simpler and straightforward way of measuring
interactions than Loewe additivity, which requires examin-
ation of interactions across a gradient of concentrations for
each of the drugs. Although Loewe integrates more infor-
mation about interactions, the ease of measurement and
calculation of BI has led to its use in a huge number of studies
[8,14,21,29,45–49], including our present one.
Methods developed here for capturing the higher order
interactions are applicable to other complex systems. These
systems include, for example, protein and gene interaction
networks (e.g. [22]), food webs (e.g. [23–25]) and transpor-
tation networks (e.g. [50]). Hence, our rescaled emergent
measure offers a systematic and straightforward method for
uncovering the complex interactions that occur in a wide
range of systems.
In summary, we have shown that our new rescaling
methods lead to a clear distinction between different cat-
egories—synergistic, additive, antagonistic buffering and
antagonistic suppressive—of interactions, and that these
distinctions do not exist when looking at results for the
unscaled measure or the previously used rescaling method
(i.e. Rescale 0). Therefore, our new rescaling methods are
required to accurately characterize cases of emergent inter-
actions among multiple drugs. In particular, Rescale 2 and
Rescale 3—synergy defined relative to lethality for both cases
and antagonistic buffering relative to the strongest lower
order effect (Rescale 2) or interaction (Rescale 3)—offer a
direct and more distinct measurement of epistasis that is
straightforward to generalize to higher order interactions.
Therefore, we propose that Rescale 2 and 3 could be a useful
tool in future studies that examine complex drug interactions
or other complex systems with interacting components.
