Abstract
Alternative therapeutics for infectious diseases is a top priority, but what infections should
be the primary targets? At present there is a focus on therapies for severe infections, for
which effective treatment is most needed, but these infections are hard to manage, and
progress has been limited. Here, we explore a different approach. Applying an evolutionary
perspective to a review of antibiotic prescription studies, we identify infections that likely
make a large contribution to resistance evolution across multiple taxa but are clinically mild
and thus present easier targets for therapeutics development. Alternative therapeutics for
these infections, we argue, would save lives indirectly by preserving the high efficacy of
existing antibiotics for the patients who need them the most.
Introduction
The evolution of antimicrobial resistance is among the greatest challenges to public health in
our time [1], and the development of novel therapeutics to replace traditional antibiotics will
likely play a key role in addressing this issue [2]. The state of the pipeline of alternative thera-
peutics was recently assessed in a report commissioned by the Wellcome Trust [2]. Focusing
on "therapies that could be developed to treat systemic/invasive rather than superficial infec-
tions" [2], the authors assessed the potential of the major current lines of research in the area,
including bacteriophages, phage lytic enzymes, probiotics, and antimicrobial peptides [2]. At
present, however, candidate therapies are a far cry from serious contenders to antibiotics in
the treatment of severe infections, and the authors of the report conclude that, rather than
being true alternatives, these therapeutics may be "used as adjuncts to antibiotics because their
activities may not provide sufficient therapeutic benefit on their own" [2].
In addition to the efforts made in the biomedical field, there is growing interest among evo-
lutionary biologists in developing drugs that are more robust to the evolution of resistance.
This can be done, for example, by targeting traits that are shared among bacterial cells, such as
quorum sensing or siderophores, and thus taking advantage of evolutionary conflicts between
groups and individuals [3,4]. While these strategies promise to be less prone to resistance evo-
lution, they only inhibit bacterial proliferation to a limited extent and are thus unlikely to be as

 effective treatments as classic antibiotics that efficiently kill the pathogen. And one would be
hard pressed to rely on such a drug as the sole antibacterial in treating a severe invasive
infection.
Thus, novel types of therapeutics are being developed, but they share the problem that,
plainly put, they are not good enough for the treatment of severe infections. In this paper, we
take one step back and address the fundamental question of what function alternative thera-
peutics for infectious diseases should serve, and we outline a way forward through a focus on
common mild infections.
The dual roles of alternatives to antibiotics
There are at least 2 ways in which alternative therapeutics can help alleviate the resistance cri-
sis. First, they can be used to manage infections that are no longer treatable with antibiotics
because the bacteria are resistant. This role entails a focus on severe infections, for which effec-
tive treatment is most needed, and therefore puts high demands on efficacy. It is a goal pro-
moted by WHO [5], which we are currently failing to achieve [2].
Second, alternative therapeutics can substitute for antibiotics in order to decrease antibiotic
consumption and thus relax selection for resistance. In this case, the focus should rather be on
infections that make a large contribution to resistance evolution and are realistic targets for
alternative therapeutics.
For which infections are alternative therapeutics most feasible?
The reasons for the current lack of success (see above) are likely complex, but we think an
important aspect is the focus on infections that are severe (e.g., sepsis) and therefore hard to
treat. By turning our attention to infections that are mild and self-limiting [6] (e.g., strep
throat), we can set the bar lower and thus plausibly increase the success rate.
Mild infections might also be more readily treated with novel therapeutic options, including
antivirulence drugs, quorum quenchers, and other therapeutics that may be less effective treat-
ments but can be made more robust to resistance evolution than traditional antibiotics [3].
Furthermore, because mild infections leave more time for diagnostics than do severe infections
that need to be treated without delay [7], they lend themselves better to therapeutics that have
a narrow spectrum and thereby a smaller negative impact on the commensal biota.
In mild infections, alternative drugs can be better for the patient
The best option for the patient is that which strikes the best balance between treatment benefit
and side effects. For antibiotics, the latter include an increased risk of future antibiotic resis-
tance [8] and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea [9]. Because alternative therapeutics are not anti-
biotics and are often narrow spectrum (e.g., phages, lysins, specific virulence factor inhibitors),
it is plausible that these side effects would be less pronounced. (The potential for other types of
side effects is hard to assess for alternatives in general.) Alternative therapeutics can therefore
be better for the patient, given that the infection is sufficiently mild that the difference in treat-
ment efficacy does not outweigh the difference in these side effects.
Are mild infections important for the evolution of resistance?
It is uncontroversial that the evolution of antibiotic resistance is driven by antibiotic use, but
the quantitative contribution of mild infections to clinically important resistance is incom-
pletely known. Here, we use a thought experiment that is grounded in evolutionary theory and

 in line with empirical data to discuss the contribution of antibiotic consumption in the com-
munity to medically relevant resistance.
Consider the following scenario. An individual harbours Escherichia coli strains with and
without genes encoding β-lactamases in an asymptomatic carriage state. The individual then
contracts streptococcal pharyngitis, consults the general practitioner, and is prescribed amoxi-
cillin. E. coli β-lactamases confer resistance to amoxicillin [10], and under treatment this gives
the β-lactamase–producing strain a competitive advantage over the nonproducing strain. The
β-lactamase–producing strain thus increases in abundance in the patient’s microbiota, tempo-
rarily or more permanently. This, in turn, increases the probability that it will transmit to
other individuals or spread to an anatomical site where it causes disease, thus contributing to
the resistance problem in the individual patient as well as society.
Consistent with this scenario, a 1-week course of amoxicillin given to healthy volunteers
resulted in an increase in E. coli positive for a β-lactamase gene in faeces [11], and a single dose
of oral ampicillin administered to patients with gonorrhoea was followed by an increase in fae-
cal E. coli resistant to this drug [12]. In addition, previous use of penicillin is a risk factor for
extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) and multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae in urinary
tract infections in the community [13,14]. The relevance of this for severe infection is sug-
gested by the finding that carriage of ESBL positive E. coli is a risk factor for bacteraemia with
these organisms [15].
This thought experiment illustrates 2 general points. First, systemic antibiotic treatment
selects for resistance throughout the patient’s microbiota, not only in the pathogen it is aimed
to target. Thus, when weighing the benefits of treatment against the problem of selecting for
resistance, one needs to look beyond the infection at hand and take the whole microbiota into
account.
Second, the use of a single antibiotic can contribute to the increase in resistance to a whole
range of drugs if resistance determinants co-occur in the same bacterial strains, which is often
the case [10]. β-lactamases are cases in point, especially ESBLs, as they confer resistance to sev-
eral antibiotics in the β-lactam group (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins [16]). But also,
genes that encode unrelated resistance mechanisms may occur together on the same mobile
genetic elements or otherwise in the same bacteria. If a strain is resistant to several antibiotics,
it will be favoured by selection imposed by any of those drugs, and when the strain increases in
frequency due to this selection, so do all resistance determinants that it encodes. Multiresistant
strains thus allow different resistance determinants to ’hitchhike’ [17] with each other. In
terms of our thought experiment with β-lactamase producing E. coli, the relevance of this
effect, even for mechanistically unrelated resistance determinants, is suggested by the co-
occurrence of resistance to third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, and the
finding that previous use of quinolones is a risk factor for ESBL in community-acquired uri-
nary tract infections [10,13,18]. The problem of multiresistance may be further exacerbated by
the fact that multiresistant strains are favoured under a larger number of treatment regimens,
and thereby in a larger fraction of patients, as compared to strains that are resistant to a single
type of antibiotic.
More generally, systematic reviews and meta-analyses have found associations between
antibiotic consumption and resistance in the community [19] as well as between antibiotic
prescription in primary care and resistance in the individual patient [8], and there is an epide-
miological association between antibiotic prescription in the community and resistance in
invasive infection [20–22]. Whilst these studies leave much open, they do suggest a role for
antibiotic consumption in the community in the spread of medically important resistance.
This is unsurprising, because the community dominates antibiotic use. For example, in the
European Union (2011) a median of 19.5 defined daily doses (DDDs) were prescribed per
PLOS Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2003533

 1,000 inhabitants per day in the community, as compared to 1.8 DDDs per 1,000 inhabitants
per day in the hospital sector [23].
In summary, the evolutionary consequences of antibiotic treatment go beyond the antibi-
otic used and the pathogen at which it is aimed, and it is plausible that prescription in the com-
munity makes a relevant contribution to resistance. Next, we turn to the indications that drive
this antibiotic use.
Which infections contribute most to antibiotic consumption in the
community?
To address this question, we review the published literature on antibiotic prescription in the
community (see S1 Text for details).
Antibiotic prescription in the community has been studied in a number of countries [24–
44], and whilst differences in diagnostic classifications among studies prevent detailed com-
parisons, a general pattern is clear: a large proportion of prescriptions are due to infections
that in previously healthy individuals are typically mild and self-limiting. Many cases pertain
to the upper respiratory tract and adjacent structures. Indeed, in the United States, sinusitis,
otitis media, and pharyngitis rank first, second, and third, respectively, and together contribute
almost 30% of the prescriptions [24].
Overall, pharyngitis/tonsillitis and urinary tract infection are among the top 4 indications
in more than half of the studies, and they contribute a median of 8.5% and 9.3% of the pre-
scriptions, respectively. There is variation among countries, however, and, for example, in
Sweden these 2 diagnoses account for 19% and 20%, respectively.
There is thus scope for considerably reducing antibiotic use by developing alternative thera-
peutics for infections that are relatively mild. For the fraction of these infections that are viral,
it is possible to decrease antibiotic prescription even in the absence of alternatives. A summary
of the findings is given in Fig 1, and details are given in S1 Text.
Streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis as a candidate for alternative
therapeutics
In this section, we discuss possible alternative treatments for pharyngotonsillitis. We discuss
this condition, specifically, because it makes an important contribution to antibiotic consump-
tion (see above), but the alternative treatment strategies available and the types of issues one
needs to consider are relevant to other conditions as well.
Bacterial pharyngotonsillitis is almost always of streptococcal aetiology, with group A strep-
tococci (GAS) accounting for the majority of cases [45]. For GAS pharyngitis, penicillins are
the treatment of choice [46], and despite extensive penicillin use, GAS are invariably sensitive.
Penicillin treatment of GAS infections may thus seem unproblematic from a resistance per-
spective. However, because these infections make a large contribution to antibiotic use, they
may affect the evolution of resistance in other bacteria, in accordance with the thought experi-
ment and discussion above.
In assessing the suitability of streptococcal pharyngitis for alternative therapeutics, it is key
to consider the reasons why this condition is currently treated with antibiotics. In their guide-
lines for the management of GAS pharyngitis, the Infectious Diseases Society of America
(IDSA) invokes the following reasons for treatment: prevention of acute rheumatic fever
(ARF), prevention of suppurative complications, improvement of clinical signs and symptoms,
reduced contagiousness/transmission, and accelerated resumption of normal activities [46].
To this may be added the prevention of Lemièrre’s syndrome due to, e.g., Fusobacterium

 necrophorum pharyngitis, which may be misdiagnosed as streptococcal. The latter risk should,
however, be small, given adequate diagnostic procedures.
The effect of antibiotic treatment in sore throat, including streptococcal, has been assessed
in a systematic review from the Cochrane Library [47]. The authors conclude that "the absolute
benefits are modest" [47] but point to the problem of context dependence. The case of ARF
serves to illustrate this problem. Antibiotic treatment decreases the risk of ARF to approxi-
mately one-fourth [47]. However, the incidence of ARF varies greatly among populations [48],
and the absolute risk of this sequela has to be locally assessed. For example, in Sweden, current
treatment guidelines state that the risk of ARF is too low to motivate the use of antibiotics [49].
(Antibiotic treatment is still recommended on other grounds.) The issue of context depen-
dence applies to suppurative complications, as well [47]. We therefore conclude that an alter-
native therapeutic for streptococcal pharyngitis should ideally address all of the reasons for
treatment listed in the IDSA guidelines, but the minimum acceptable level of effectiveness in
preventing sequelae will differ among populations. The reduction of symptoms and shortening
of the infection period are, on the other hand, relevant to all populations. In the following, we
discuss alternative approaches that we think have potential.
Asymptomatic carriage of GAS is common and does not normally warrant antibiotic treat-
ment, as the risks for complications and transmission are considered low [46]. One potential
strategy would therefore be to develop antivirulence drugs that turn symptomatic infection
into asymptomatic carriage, decrease the symptoms and risks associated with infection, or
help the immune system to clear the bacteria. Specific factors of interest include the superanti-
gens, such as the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A, which induce inflammation and may
contribute to both symptoms and bacterial burden in pharyngitis [50,51], and streptokinase,
which has been implicated in the evasion of host defence in the microvasculature as well as
Fig 1. Mild infections make a large contribution to antibiotic prescription. The literature on antibiotic
prescription in the community was reviewed, and the top 4 indications in each country studied were extracted.
The 6 diagnoses that were among the top 4 in the largest proportion of studies are presented above, with bars
representing the proportion of studies (countries, n = 21) in which the diagnosis was among the top 4 (see S1

 saliva [52,53]. In addition, both the superantigens and streptokinase are likely to be bacterial
public goods and thus lend themselves to more evolutionarily robust therapeutics [3], although
the fact that different strains have different superantigen profiles suggests the possibility of
strain replacement in response to interventions. Although the feasibility of this approach is
hard to assess, the fact that the virulence mechanisms of GAS have been extensively studied at
the molecular level speaks in its favour.
Another approach would be to use bacteriophages. As compared to the antivirulence
approach, this would have the benefit of killing the bacteria and thus make it more similar to
current treatment. A recent study in the Russian military reported promising results using
phages as prophylaxis for respiratory tract infections, including tonsillitis [54]. We would
interpret this study cautiously, however, because the published full text is incomplete, with
some pages omitted.
The mechanisms by which phages kill streptococci are known, and work on sequestering
these mechanisms for therapeutic purposes has made substantial progress. Thus, phage lytic
enzymes have been shown to be effective against GAS in mouse models of invasive infection
[55] as well as oral colonization [56].
The therapeutic avenues discussed above have the potential to address all of the reasons for
current antibiotic treatment of GAS pharyngotonsillitis, as listed in the IDSA guidelines. In
addition, the therapeutics would be more specific to GAS than are current antibiotics. In the
case of antivirulence drugs, this is due to the fact that specific molecular mechanisms of viru-
lence would be targeted, while the narrow host range of phages has a similar effect for therapy
with phages and their lytic enzymes. These potential therapeutics should therefore be less dis-
ruptive to the patient’s microbiota and impose less selection on other bacteria, as compared to
traditional antibiotics.
Discussion and conclusion
Here, we have made 2 interconnected points. First, infections that are relatively mild make a
large contribution to antibiotic prescription, and it is plausible that this translates into consid-
erable selection pressure for antibiotic resistance.
Second, by turning our attention to infections that make a large contribution to resistance
evolution but are clinically mild, we may increase the success rate of alternative therapeutics
development and decrease the selection pressure for resistance to current antibiotics. We have
focussed on the contribution to bulk antibiotic consumption, but more subtle aspects are also
relevant. For example, different groups of patients (e.g., age groups) differ in the incidence of
specific infections as well as in the bacteria they carry asymptomatically and their co-occurring
medical conditions and histories, and this may affect the type of resistance being prevented.
In conclusion, together with other strategies, such as shorter courses [8] and the use of
more narrow spectrum antibiotics [12], where applicable, alternative therapeutics for mild
infections would decrease the selection pressure for antibiotic resistance and thus help retain
the efficacy of current antibiotics, so that we can keep using them to treat the severe infections
for which we fail to develop novel drugs.
