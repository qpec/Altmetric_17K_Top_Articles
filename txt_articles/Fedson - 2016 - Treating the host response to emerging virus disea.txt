Abstract: There is an ongoing threat of epidemic or pandemic diseases that could be caused by influenza, Ebola 
or other emerging viruses. It will be difficult and costly to develop new drugs that target each of these viruses. 
Statins and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been effective in treating patients with sepsis, pneumonia 
and influenza, and a statin/ARB combination appeared to dramatically reduce mortality during the recent Ebola 
outbreak. These drugs target (among other things) the endothelial dysfunction found in all of these diseases. Most 
scientists work on new drugs that target viruses, and few accept the idea of treating the host response with generic 
drugs. A great deal of research will be needed to show conclusively that these drugs work, and this will require 
the support of public agencies and foundations. Investigators in developing countries should take an active role 
in this research. If the next Public Health Emergency of International Concern is caused by an emerging virus, a 
“top down” approach to developing specific new drug treatments is unlikely to be effective. However, a “bottom 
up” approach to treatment that targets the host response to these viruses by using widely available and inexpensive 
generic drugs could reduce mortality in any country with a basic health care system. In doing so, it would make an 
immeasurable contribution to global equity and global security.

Introduction 
For almost two decades, leading scientists and health 
officials have warned that we must prepare for a potentially 
devastating global pandemic of an infectious disease. Initial 
concern was focused on the avian influenza A (H5N1) 
virus. More recently, people in West Africa have endured a 
devastating outbreak of Ebola virus disease. Several other 
emerging viruses are believed to seriously threaten global 
health and global security. T
o prepare, scientists have been 
urged to discover new vaccines and treatments for these 
emerging viruses. At the same time, political leaders have 
been urged by global health experts to invest millions in a 
“top down” restructuring of the global health system. 
This article takes a different view. It focuses on an 
alternative approach to the scientific discovery of treatments 
for individual patients, reviews the mechanisms of action 
and clinical experience with specific drugs that might 
be useful, and considers whether or not recent lessons 
regarding this “bottom up” approach to treatment have 
been learned. 
Reductionist science and the discovery of new 
treatments
In a recent report, van Vught and colleagues sought 
to explain why hospitalized patients are susceptible to 
nosocomial pneumonia (1). They assumed that one reason 
might be immune suppression caused by the conditions for 
which they had been hospitalized. T
o address this question, 
they compared the systemic host responses of ICU patients 
with hospital-acquired and community-acquired pneumonia 
(HAP and CAP, respectively). They measured 19 plasma 
biomarkers and determined genome-wide gene expression

profiles for the two groups. T
o their surprise, they found 
that levels of inflammatory cytokines and endothelial and 
coagulation responses in the two groups were similar, as 
were most measures of clinical outcome. Although some of 
the biomarker responses in HAP patients were “modestly 
mitigated” (under-expression of type 1 interferon and 
elevated expression of “cell junction and mobility gene 
signatures”), subgroup analyses, including the presence or 
absence of COPD and the type of infection, confirmed the 
overall findings (1). Not surprisingly, HAP patients were 
admitted to the ICU later (mean 8 days) than CAP patients 
(mean 0 days), but mortality rates in the two groups were 
not statistically different. Although overall clinical outcomes 
were similar in HAP and CAP patients, no information was 
provided on whether host responses were different in those 
who survived compared with those who died. 
The study by van Vught et al. adds to our understanding 
of the many mechanisms involved in the host response to 
infection. Like most descriptive studies, it provides scientific 
explanations for what happens, yet offers no guidance on 
how to improve outcomes in patients with pneumonia, 
sepsis and other forms of critical illness. More than 100 
clinical trials have been undertaken to test drugs designed 
to modify individual signaling molecules or pathways 
involved in the host response to sepsis (2). None of these 
trials has led to meaningful improvement in patient survival. 
Suggestions to improve the research model have included (I) 
identifying plausible targets for intervention; (II) improving 
patient selection, stratification and staging; (III) developing 
new designs for early phase studies; and (IV) creating 
new large-scale collaborative groups of investigators (2). 
Nonetheless, plausible targets for intervention have almost 
always been chosen based on findings in animal models that 
focused on individual molecules (e.g., TLR4), pathways (e.g., 
coagulation) or systems (e.g., innate immunity) known to be 
associated with adverse outcomes. These choices reflect an 
approach to discovery that seeks incremental improvements 
in scientific understanding. It is epitomized most recently 
by systems and computational biology. The study by van 
Vught et al. is a good example of this reductionist approach 
to discovery. 
A different approach to discovering new 
treatments 
 
A different approach to therapeutic discovery moves in 
the opposite direction. It starts with the recognition that a 
beneficial clinical phenotype has already been observed with 
treatment, and it then uses the tools of reductionist science 
to investigate the mechanism(s) that brought this about. It 
is important to understand that although this alternative 
is informed by the discoveries of reductionist science, it 
is driven primarily by an unwavering focus on the clinical 
(phenotypic) benefits that have been (or seem to have 
been) achieved with treatment. In effect, it exemplifies a 
Darwinian approach to therapeutic discovery. 
A good example of this approach is the propensity-
matched observational studies of Mortensen and colleagues 
(3,4). They studied patients hospitalized with community-
acquired pneumonia who had been treated with statins 
and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). In their initial 
study (3), outpatient treatment with either a statin or 
an ARB prior to hospitalization was associated with an 
approximately 30% reduction in 30-day all-cause mortality, 
and inpatient treatment with either drug was similarly 
or more effective (Table 1). In a more recent study using 
slightly different methodology, outpatient treatment with a 
combination of the two drugs was 60% effective in reducing 
30-day all-cause mortality (Table 1) (4). 
A large body of earlier experimental and clinical research 
had suggested that statins and ARBs might be effective 
in treating pneumonia patients. These drugs had been 
developed by cardiovascular scientists to treat patients with 
heart disease (statins) and hypertension (ARBs). Gradually, 
investigators realized they also had broad anti-inflammatory 
and immunomodulatory (pleiotropic) activities that 
affected, among other things, inflammatory and anti-
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, the complement 
cascade, coagulation factors, oxidative stress, macrophage 
and T cell polarization, late mediators of inflammation 
[e.g., high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), specialized 
pro-resolving mediators of inflammation (e.g., lipoxins, 
resolvins), mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism 
(5,6). These factors are now acknowledged to actively affect 
the host response to sepsis (7), pneumonia (8), and other 
forms of acute critical illness. Furthermore, cardiovascular 
investigators have published more than 80 reports showing 
that combination statin/ARB treatment is more effective 
than treatment with either agent by itself (9,10; DS Fedson, 
unpublished observations). 
A full discussion of the many drugs (including PPAR and 
AMPK agonists) that might be useful in modifying the host 
response to critical illness, and the mechanisms by which 
they might act, is beyond the scope of this article. Instead, 
the focus will be on treatment with statins and ARBs and 
how they affect the host response.

Endothelial and epithelial dysfunction in critical 
illness 
There is growing recognition that endothelial dysfunction 
and the loss of endothelial barrier integrity are central 
to the pathophysiology of bacterial sepsis and acute 
lung injury (7,11,12). Many systemic virus diseases (13), 
including influenza (14), dengue and Hantavirus pulmonary 
 
syndrome (15), are also characterized by endothelial 
dysfunction. Figure 1 shows the vascular endothelium in 
its resting state (on the left) and many of the changes in 
endothelial cell function that occur with sepsis (on the 
 
right) (7). The disruption of tight junctions between 
endothelial cells leads to a loss of barrier integrity, followed 
by the leak of fluid from the blood into interstitial tissues 
and beyond (e.g., the alveoli in pneumonia). Inflammatory 
changes facilitate the recruitment of macrophages and 
neutrophils that adhere to and transition through the 
endothelium. These and other changes activate the 
coagulation cascade, which in turn further stimulates 
inflammation and often establishes a feed-forward cycle in 
which more inflammation causes even more endothelial 
injury. Some of the signaling molecules involved in 
maintaining endothelial barrier integrity and in its 
disruption are shown in Figure 1 (7). Others that play 
important roles in endothelial cell signaling include the 
angiopoietin (Angpt)/Tie2 signaling axis, angiotensin-
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), vascular endothelial cadherin 
(VE-cadherin), claudins, C3a/C5a, RhoA/Rac1 GTPases, 
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and sphingosine-
1-phosphate-1 (S1P1) (7,8,11,12). Many other facets of 
endothelial activity are also involved, including redox 
metabolism (16) and mitochondrial function (17,18). 
Epithelial cell dysfunction is also a well-known feature of 
the host response to critical illness. Several abnormalities, 
including a loss of barrier integrity, increased permeability, 
epithelial apoptosis and increased levels of biomarkers, have 
been observed in the lung, liver, kidney and gastrointestinal 
tract (19). Despite the anatomic closeness of epithelial and 
endothelial cells, it is unclear to what extent functional 
disturbances in these two cell types are unique or shared. 
Many treatments being developed for endothelial 
dysfunction could also affect similar disturbances in 
epithelial cells. This might be especially important for 
understanding how treatments for influenza and Ebola virus 
disease work, as discussed below. 
Statin and ARB effects on endothelial and 
epithelial dysfunction
Several of the signaling molecules and pathways associated 
with disrupting or protecting the endothelial barrier 
are shown in Table 2 (7,12). Treatment with statins and 
ARBs appears to benefit patients with sepsis, pneumonia, 
influenza and other forms of critical illness, and may do 
so by maintaining or restoring endothelial (and perhaps 
epithelial) barrier integrity. Statins and ARBs are known 
to affect endothelial cells (for example, 20-24). Their 
benefits involve (at least in part) the Angpt/Tie2 and ACE2/
angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas signaling axes.

community-acquired pneumonia: the previous study (3) and the recent study (4). All patients had received antibiotics within 48 hours of 
admission. Among patients treated with both statins and ARB, 2.2% were treated as outpatients and 0.8% as inpatients. Prior outpatient 
use was defined as enough medication to last until hospital admission, assuming 80% compliance. Inpatients received treatment for at 
least the first 2 days of hospitalization. The multilevel regression analysis adjusted for age; co-morbid diseases; tobacco, drug and alcohol 
abuse; and other medications (cardiac, diabetic, respiratory and corticosteroids). Similar levels of effectiveness in preventing 30-day all-
cause mortality were obtained in the previous study for patients treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (data not shown). *,

Angpt/Tie2 signaling
The molecular biology of the Angpt/Tie2 signaling axis 
has been revealed in studies spanning more than a decade 
(25-28). Angpt-1 is found in platelets, pericytes and 
especially in endothelial cells, where it acts constitutively 
to maintain endothelial barrier integrity. Tie2, a tyrosine 
kinase receptor, is found almost exclusively in endothelial 
cells. (There is no information on whether Angpt/Tie2 
signaling is involved in any form of epithelial dysfunction in 
critical illness.) An increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines 
in patients with sepsis causes the release of Angpt-2 from 
storage in Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) within endothelial 
cells (Figure 2) (29). Release of Angpt-2 suppresses Tie2 
signaling, reduces Foxo-1 phosphorylation and increases 
Angpt-2 gene transcription. The loss of Tie2 signaling 
leads directly to endothelial dysfunction, and in mice 
its restoration reverses the acute lung injury seen with 
influenza virus infection (30). Increases in RhoA kinase and 
myosin light chain kinase activity are other mechanisms 
Figure 1 Changes in the VE response to inflammatory stimuli during sepsis. The resting vascular endothelium is shown on the left in its 
natural state. As shown on the right, sepsis produces profound changes that convert the endothelium to a procoagulant state. This disrupted 
endothelium expedites the loss of fluid through disengaged tight junctions and expedites the recruitment, attachment and extravasation of 
inflammatory cells through the endothelium. Activation of the coagulation cascade potentiates inflammation and completes a vicious cycle 
in which inflammation induces and exacerbates coagulopathies and endothelial injury. Only some of the signaling molecules involved in 
maintaining endothelial barrier integrity are shown in the figure. Others that play important roles include Angpt/Tie2 signaling, the ACE2/
angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas signaling axis, C3a/C5a, RhoA/Rac1 GTPases, matrix metalloproteinases, and S1P1. ESL1, E-selectin ligand 1;

involved in the loss of endothelial barrier integrity and the 
ensuing plasma leakage (26-29,31). 
In mice (27,28,32) and humans (27-29,31-37), sepsis 
is associated with increased plasma levels of Angpt-2, 
increased plasma leakage into the lungs, and increased liver 
and renal dysfunction (27-33). Tie2 activation maintains 
or restores endothelial barrier integrity in experimental 
sepsis (34). In patients with sepsis, an increased serum level 
of Angpt-2 serves as a useful biomarker that signifies an 
increased risk of multi-organ failure and death (35-39). 
Treatment with statins and ARBs directly affects the 
Angpt/Tie2 signaling axis. Statins activate Akt and increase 
phosphorylation of Foxo1, which decreases Angpt-2 
production (Figure 2) and increases endothelial barrier 
integrity (29). Endothelial barrier integrity is also enhanced 
by statin inhibition of Rho and Rac geranylgeranylation (30). 
 
Moreover, mice with a deletion in vitamin D receptor 
develop severe LPS-induced acute lung injury, which can 
be reduced by pretreatment with either an experimental 
Angpt-2 antagonist or an ARB (40). 
ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas signaling
Studies published more than a decade ago showed that ACE2 
is the functional receptor for SARS coronavirus (41-43). 
 
Soon thereafter, ACE2 was shown to protect mice from 
acute lung injury associated with experimental sepsis (44). 
This study suggested a broad role for ACE2 signaling in the 
pathogenesis of sepsis, acute lung injury and other forms of 
acute critical illness (45-47). 
The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) modulates many 
essential functions that maintain homeostasis. Angiotensin 
II (Ang II), which acts on type 1 Ang II receptor (AT1R), 
is central to RAS activities. Ang II increases endothelial 
barrier permeability (48). The ACE homolog ACE2 acts as 
a counter-regulator to the activities of Ang II by forming 
angiotensin-(1-7), which acts via the Mas receptor to oppose 
the vasoconstrictor and inflammatory effects of ACE/Ang II/
AT1R signaling (45-47). ACE2 has been found in alveolar 
epithelial cells, enterocytes in the small intestines, and 
endothelial and smooth muscle cells in several organs (43).

The ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas signaling axis 
modifies several aspects of both acute and chronic 
inflammation. It has beneficial effects on insulin 
metabolism (49) and on the cardiovascular (46,50), 
renal (51), and coagulation systems (52). It attenuates 
inflammatory damage to endothelial cells in vascular 
disease (53-55) and diabetes (56,57). In experimental 
sepsis, ACE2/ang-(1-7)/Mas signaling down regulates 
inflammatory changes in endothelial cells (58) and 
improves outcomes (59,60). Similarly, in experimental 
acute lung injury, this signaling axis reverses endothelial 
and epithelial cell dysfunction (61-65) and prevents 
ARDS (66-68). Children with ARDS have an increase in 
bronchoalveolar fluid ACE and a decrease in ACE2 (69). 
Several experimental studies have demonstrated the 
benefits of treatments that target ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/
Mas signaling. In experimental rodent models of sepsis 
and acute lung injury, ARBs down regulate numerous 
pro-inflammatory cytokines and improve outcomes 
(59,62,70). These findings are supported by other studies 
of ARB treatment in models of cardiac hypertrophy and 
vascular injury (71-74). Moreover, in a rabbit model of 
atherosclerosis, statin treatment up regulates ACE2 in 
the heart, and this is associated with epigenetic histone 
modifications (75). 
Clinical experience with statin and ARB 
treatment in patients with critical illness
The demonstrated effects of statin and ARB treatment on 
Angpt/Tie2 and ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas signaling 
in endothelial and epithelial cells provide a solid basis for 
considering using these drugs to treat patients with acute 
critical illness. Thus far, statins and ARBs have been used to 
treat patients with sepsis, ARDS, influenza and Ebola virus 
disease. Opinions vary on the interpretation of published 
Figure 2 Mechanism of statin-mediated suppression of Angpt-2 production in endothelial cells during sepsis. Under normal conditions, 
Tie2 is tonically activated by Angpt-1, and this in turn activates Akt, leading to the phosphorylation of Foxo-1 and suppression of Angpt-2 
expression. In sepsis, inflammatory cytokines lead to the release of pre-formed Angpt-2 from Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs). The local 
increase in Angpt-2 suppresses Tie2 signaling, reducing Foxo-1 phosphorylation and increasing ANGPT2 gene transcription. Statins 
(simvastatin) activate AKT, increase Foxo-1 phosphorylation and decrease the production of Angpt-2. ACE2, angiotensin-converting

Angpt-2 antagonizes Tie2 in 
the context of inflammation, 
a profound initial release of 
preformed Angpt-2 could 
initiate a feedback loop that 
sustains (and perhaps ampli-
fies) the deleterious state of 
Tie2 signaling impairment. 
Thus, primary prevention 
of Angpt-2 induction may 
be more effective clinically 
than efforts to intervene after 
an Angpt-2/Tie2 feedback 
loop has been established.

Figure 7. Proposed mechanism for statin-mediated suppression of ongoing Angpt-2 production during sepsis. 
In endothelium of quiescent blood vessels, Tie2 is tonically expressed and activated. Through downstream 
activation of Akt, Foxo1 is phosphorylated and Angpt-2 transcription is suppressed. During the initial phase of 
sepsis, pre-formed Angpt-2 stored in Weibel Palade bodies (WPBs) is rapidly exocytosed in response to early 
acute-phase cytokines. Excess Angpt-2 impairs Tie2 signaling, which in turn, reduces Foxo1 phosphorylation 
and enables it to drive the transcription of the ANGPT2 gene. Simvastatin favors the phosphorylation of Foxo1, 
thus attenuating the production of Angpt-2.

reports, but on the whole the results have been encouraging. 
Sepsis and pneumonia
The experimental foundation for treating the host response 
in patients with sepsis and acute lung injury can be found in 
studies of simvastatin treatment of LPS-treated mice (76-
78). There have been more than 25 observational studies 
of outpatient statin treatment in patients hospitalized with 
infection, pneumonia or sepsis (79). Overall, statins were 
found to reduce episodes of hospitalization and mortality, 
although a high degree of heterogeneity among the studies 
has led to caution in interpreting the results. 
Four reports of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
of inpatient statin treatment of ICU patients with sepsis 
and ARDS have been published (80-85). In three of these 
reports, patients were mechanically ventilated. None of the 
RCT
s showed a reduction in mortality, and three trials were 
abandoned early for reasons of futility. Statin treatment was 
found to be safe in these ICU patients, but it was probably 
“too little too late”; in one study, patients had been treated 
with mechanical ventilation for a mean of eight days before 
statin treatment was begun (81). 
Another RCT of statin treatment in sepsis patients 
was conducted by clinicians in Birmingham, UK (86), 
although their study has received little attention from 
intensive care specialists. Patients who presented to the 
emergency department with signs of sepsis but no evidence 
(yet) of multi-organ failure were randomized to receive 
either atorvastatin (49 patients; 40 mg per day) or placebo 
 
(51 patients). All study subjects had been statin-naive for 
at least two weeks, and treatment was started as soon as 
they were hospitalized. The primary goal was to determine 
whether “statin treatment might reduce the absolute rate 
with which sepsis converted to severe sepsis” (i.e., multi-
organ failure) (86). The investigators calculated they 
would need 414 patients to detect a statistically significant 
reduction in severe sepsis of 15% (e.g., from 40% to 25%). 
Although slow recruitment forced the investigators to 
stop their trial prematurely, they succeeded in achieving 
their primary goal: the occurrence of severe sepsis was 
reduced not by 15% as planned, but by 83%. Because the 
development of multi-organ failure in sepsis patients is 
thought to be due to the loss of endothelial barrier integrity, 
it is reasonable to conclude that the positive outcome in this 
RCT reflected the activity of atorvastatin in maintaining 
endothelial barrier integrity. As discussed above, statins 
probably contribute to maintaining endothelial barrier 
integrity by affecting the Angpt/Tie2 signaling axis (30).
Influenza
The host response to influenza virus infection has been 
studied extensively, and many of these studies have been 
recently reviewed (87-92). In both experimental and human 
influenza, a greater degree of virus replication is generally 
associated with greater inflammation and more severe 
disease (93,94). However, individual influenza viruses 
may differ in the extent to which they elicit inflammatory 
responses, and the degree of hypercytokinemia is not 
always directly associated with levels of virus replication or 
mortality (88,95).
Endothelial and epithelial cells are intimately involved 
in the host response to influenza virus infection, and it is 
often difficult to separate the two. Both cell types can be 
infected in vitro with influenza A H5N1 viruses (96-98), and 
this is associated with a brisk and unbalanced inflammatory 
response involving (among other things) NF-kappa B 
and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3 (99,100). Studies 
in cell co-culture systems, however, show that influenza 
viruses primarily target epithelial rather than endothelial 
cells (97,101,102). Nonetheless, while helpful, these in 
vitro studies cannot take account of the complex interplay 
between these cells and other components of the host 
response in vivo (especially leukocytes and macrophages), 
which contribute to the inflammatory response (102-106). 
 
Tellingly, the importance of host factors, not virus 
replication, was shown conclusively in a study of 
experimental acute lung injury following intra-tracheal 
instillation of inactivated H5N1 influenza virus (107).
In the lung, ACE2 is found primarily in epithelial 
cells (108), and the ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas axis 
directly regulates epithelial cell survival (109,110). In mice, 
ACE2 is a mediator of the acute lung injury caused by 
influenza A H5N1- and H7N9-virus infection (111,112), 
and in patients, increased ACE2 levels are associated with 
severe disease (111,113). In mice experimentally infected 
with H5N1 influenza, treatment with an ARB (losartan) 
improves survival (114). 
The Angpt/Tie2 signaling axis is also involved in the 
pathogenesis of experimental influenza (32). Angpt-like 4, 
a member of the Angpt family that does not signal through 
Tie2, also promotes vascular permeability in experimental 
influenza (115). Importantly, a specific Tie2 agonist 
(Vasculotide) promotes survival in mice infected with 
influenza virus (31). In this study, all of the mice that were

given only an antiviral agent immediately after infection 
died, whereas those that were also given a Tie2 agonist 
starting as late as five days after infection survived. 
Statins reduce influenza virus replication in vitro (116), 
but for several reasons, studies of statin treatment of 
influenza virus-infected mice have been inconclusive (117). 
There is still a good possibility that statins might contribute 
to improved survival in human influenza because, among 
other things, they down regulate pro-inflammatory 
cytokines. Statins probably act in other ways as well. For 
example, in mice, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand 
(TRAIL) signaling promotes apoptosis in epithelial cells 
(118), while in humans with acute coronary syndrome 
(another inflammatory illness), statins reduce endothelial 
cell apoptosis (119). Thus, statins would probably have 
a positive effect on the host response to influenza. In all 
of these studies, statins were used by themselves, and not 
combined with other immunomodulatory agents. 
More than a decade ago, when the prospect of a global 
avian H5N1 influenza pandemic was of great concern, it 
was suggested that treating the host response might be an 
effective way to mitigate pandemic mortality (120-122). 
The need for such an approach was amply demonstrated 
during the influenza H1N1 pandemic in 2009-2010, when 
more than 90% of the world’s people had no access to 
adequate supplies of pandemic vaccines and antiviral agents 
(121,122). More recently, the emergence of the influenza A 
H7N9 and similar influenza viruses has served as a reminder 
that the pandemic threat has not disappeared (123). There 
are many ongoing efforts to improve the global supply of 
influenza vaccines (124-126). Nonetheless, during the first 
6 months of the next pandemic, access to pandemic vaccines 
will be severely limited for virtually everyone in the world 
(121,122). 
Influenza accounts for a substantial proportion of cases 
of medically attended acute respiratory infection (MAARI). 
Two large observational studies of statin treatment in 
MAARI patients have yielded conflicting results (there 
are no such studies for ARBs). In one study from the UK, 
statin treatment resulted in a 33–35% reduction in 30-day 
all-cause mortality (127), although the proportion of these 
illnesses that were caused by influenza virus infection was 
unknown and the investigators were unable to control for 
previous influenza vaccination in their analysis. In another 
study from the US, the effectiveness of influenza vaccination 
in MAARI patients was actually reduced in individuals who 
were taking statins (128), although like the UK study, the 
proportion of illnesses caused by influenza virus infection 
was unknown. Nonetheless, these findings from the US 
are compatible with those of another study, which showed 
that elderly patients taking statins had reduced antibody 
responses following influenza vaccination (129). 
In a recent report, investigators used a test-negative 
design to study the effectiveness of influenza vaccination, 
outpatient statin treatment, or both in preventing 
laboratory-confirmed, medically attended influenza in 
adults ≥45 years in age (130). Table 3 summarizes their 
findings for influenza A H3N2. (Similar findings were 
reported for influenza A H1N1 and influenza B, although 
the numbers of such patients were small.) In patients who 
had received influenza vaccine, outpatient treatment with 
statins reduced the effectiveness of vaccination from 46% to 
25%. However, in unvaccinated subjects, outpatient statin 
treatment alone reduced the number of cases of influenza by 
37%. When influenza vaccines are unavailable, as will occur 
during the early months of the next pandemic, this finding 
will take on special meaning. 
Interpretation of the results of outpatient studies of statin 
treatment in patients with MAARI and laboratory-confirmed 
influenza may be debatable, but it is more important to know

whether statins benefit patients hospitalized with laboratory-
confirmed influenza because it is hospitalized patients who 
are at increased risk of dying (121). T
wo observational studies 
suggest that inpatient statin treatment could reduce 30-day 
all-cause mortality (Table 4) (131,132). Both studies were 
conducted using the same database, both used propensity 
scoring and both controlled for age, sex, underlying co-
morbid conditions, and (importantly) previous influenza 
vaccination and antiviral treatment. The first study 
(retrospective cohort) found that statin treatment reduced 
30-day all-cause mortality by 41%, suggesting that statins 
might be useful in treating influenza patients requiring 
hospitalization (Table 4) (131). The second study (case-
control) found that statins reduced 30-day mortality by an 
even greater margin −59% (Table 4) (132). Nonetheless, 
investigators for the second study concluded that because 
of unmeasured confounding, statins should not be used 
“as adjunct treatment for preventing death among persons 
hospitalized for influenza” (132). The findings for statins 
and ARB treatment of community-acquired pneumonia 
(Table 1) and those for statin treatment of laboratory-
confirmed influenza (Table 3) suggest this conclusion is 
premature. 
Ebola virus disease
More than a decade ago, Ebola scientists noted clinical 
similarities between Ebola and septic shock (133). When 
the outbreak of Ebola virus disease appeared in West Africa 
in 2014, experience with treating the host response in 
patients with sepsis, pneumonia and influenza suggested the 
same approach might improve outcomes in Ebola patients. 
Recent experimental studies suggest that statins might 
be effective against the Ebola virus itself. For example, 
heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has been shown to suppress 
Ebola virus replication (134), and statins are known to up 
regulate HO-1 (135). Moreover, Ebola viruses are cytotoxic 
because they target cell membrane cholesterol (136), which 
is affected by statins. Other studies, however, suggest that 
the host response to Ebola virus infection itself could be a 
target of treatment. Genetic studies of Ebola in mice have 
shown that endothelial dysfunction and increased vascular 
permeability are associated with Tie2 (137). Ebola virus 
glycoprotein activates endothelial cells in vitro via a TLR4-
mediated mechanism (138), and TLR4 is down regulated 
by statin treatment. Most of these experimental findings 
were published before Ebola virus-infected health care 
workers were evacuated to the US and Europe. Clinical 
findings documented in the case reports for these patients 
convincingly demonstrated endothelial dysfunction 
and massive fluid losses that reflected a breakdown of 
endothelial barrier integrity (139,140). 
On August 15, 2014, shortly after WHO declared 
Ebola to be a Public Health Emergency of International 
Concern, a letter was published online suggesting that 
statins and/or ARBs might be useful in treating Ebola 
patients and should be tested (141). This idea was not 
well received by Ebola scientists (142) and officials at 
the World Health Organization (WHO) (DS Fedson, 
unpublished observations). Nonetheless, a few months later, 
physicians in Sierra Leone were able to treat consecutively 
approximately 100 Ebola patients with a combination 
of atorvastatin (40 mg/day) and irbesartan (150 mg/day) 
(143,144). Some of these patients were also treated for 
2–3 days with clomiphene, a selective estrogen receptor 
modifier (SERM) previously shown to have antiviral activity 
against Ebola virus (145,146). [Although clomiphene has 
not been described as having immunomodulatory activities, 
other drugs in the same category have been used to treated 
immune-mediated diseases (147)]. There was no financial 
or logistical support for a proper clinical trial, but thanks 
to a private donation the drugs were made available to 
local physicians. Only three inadequately treated patients 
are known to have died (143,144). The physicians and

supervising health officials responsible for these patients 
refused to publicly release information on their experience, 
but their treatment results were documented immediately 
in letters and memoranda (Figure 3) and eventually in 
local newspapers (148). Unfortunately, international 
organizations involved in the Ebola response, including 
WHO, have made no effort to validate these findings (DS 
Fedson, unpublished observations). 
Earlier, in September 2014, health officials at WHO 
decided that only investigational treatments that target the 
virus would be tested in Ebola patients (149) (experimental 
Ebola vaccines were also approved for testing). Several 
clinical trials were undertaken (at great expense) to test 
experimental antiviral drugs, convalescent plasma and 
monoclonal antibodies (150). Because of a decline in the 
number of cases, some of the trials had to be abandoned. In 
the few that were completed, none of the treatments had a 
major effect in improving overall survival in Ebola patients, 
especially in those with high virus loads; i.e., those most in 
need of effective treatment (151-154). 
In spite of these disappointing clinical experiences, Ebola 
scientists continue to focus on developing treatments that 
target the virus (155,156). Some investigators insist that 
the rhesus macaque non-human primate (NHP) model 
provides the “gold standard” for testing investigational 
Ebola treatments (157). Surprisingly, no investigator has 
ever shown that Ebola virus infection in NHPs replicates 
the endothelial dysfunction and massive fluid losses that are 
the hallmark of human Ebola virus disease. This contrasts 
with the experience of earlier investigators who showed that 
NHPs could be used to study endothelial dysfunction in 
other models of critical illness (158-160). Moreover, Ebola 
scientists seem to be unfamiliar with the findings of HIV 
scientists who have studied simian immunodeficiency virus 
(SIV) infection in two NHP species. Clinical outcomes 
are very different in rhesus macaques, all of whom die, 
compared with sooty mangabeys, all of whom live (161,162). 
Remarkably, both species have similarly high virus loads. 
The findings from SIV infection in these two NHP models 
demonstrate convincingly that the host response, not virus

load, primarily determines outcome. 
Investigators have yet to explain why gastrointestinal 
endothelial dysfunction is so prominent in Ebola virus 
disease, whereas the lung, liver and kidneys are the 
primary targets of severe or fatal sepsis, pneumonia and 
influenza. [Interestingly, influenza viruses naturally cause 
gastrointestinal infection in waterfowl, and experimental GI 
infection of cats shows that influenza A H5N1 virus targets 
intestinal endothelial cells and leads to widespread systemic 
infection (163)].
The complex relationship between the gut and other 
organs in critical illness has only begun to be explored (164). 
 
Experimental and human studies show that ACE2 in 
gut epithelial cells is necessary for normal absorption of 
amino acids (165,166) and glucose (167). In addition, the 
absence of ACE2 in gut epithelial cells alters immunity and 
leads to increased inflammation (165). Both experimental 
animals (168) and humans (169) with acute intestinal 
inflammation have elevated plasma levels of ACE2 and 
angiotensin-(1-7). In animal models of acute intestinal 
inflammation, treatment with ARBs down regulates pro-
inflammatory cytokines and reduces oxidative stress and 
epithelial apoptosis (170-172), and statins have similar 
effects (173-175). Apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells is 
a common finding in human and animal studies of critical 
illness (164). It is tempting to speculate that the response of 
Ebola patients in Sierra Leone to combination statin/ARB 
treatment might have been due to the favorable effects of 
ARBs (and perhaps statins) on ACE2 in intestinal epithelial 
(and perhaps endothelial) cells. 
Clinical investigators continue to seek a better 
understanding of the host response to Ebola virus infection. 
A recent study of seven Ebola virus-infected healthcare 
workers explored 54 separate plasma biomarkers of severe 
disease (176). The investigators documented activation 
of the coagulation cascade and evidence of endothelial 
dysfunction, although levels of Angpt-2, ACE2 and 
angiotensin-(1-7) were not measured. These biomarker 
findings reflect the increase in vascular permeability that 
clinicians have long known to be a central feature of Ebola 
virus disease. 
A few investigators believe that treating the host response 
in Ebola patients is a reasonable idea (177,178), but their 
views are not widely shared. Recently, other investigators 
reviewed the overall clinical experience in managing 
patients with Ebola virus disease in and outside of West 
Africa (179). They noted that open-label; uncontrolled 
studies like the statins/ARB experience in Sierra Leone (143) 
 
“precluded any conclusions” about the effectiveness of 
this treatment. Because no specific treatment had yet been 
shown to be effective, they concluded, “improving the 
global capacity to provide supportive critical care… may be 
associated with the greatest opportunity to improve patient 
outcomes” (179). They offered no suggestions on how or at 
what cost this could be accomplished. 
Implications for treating the host response to 
other emerging virus infections 
The threat of a major influenza pandemic has not 
disappeared. Virologists regularly document the natural 
emergence of influenza virus reassortants with pandemic 
potential (180). According to WHO, several other emerging 
viruses also threaten to cause epidemics or pandemics, and 
urgent attention should be given to developing vaccines and 
treatments (Table 5) (181). In practical terms, it is unlikely 
that specific vaccines will be developed for each of these 
viruses, let alone produced, distributed and administered 
to populations before one of these viruses emerges. The 
same is true for specific antiviral agents. Yet the diseases 
associated with all but one of the emerging viruses requiring 
urgent research and development (R&D) are characterized 
by endothelial dysfunction (there are no data for Rift Valley 
fever) (42,182-185). Endothelial dysfunction is also seen in 
Table 5 Emerging virus diseases likely to cause major epidemics or pandemics (181)

dengue and Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (186), and it is 
a feature of several diseases thought to represent bioterrorist 
threats, including inhalation anthrax (32,187). 
As discussed earlier, a large number of agents that 
appeared promising in experimental studies have not 
been found to be effective in clinical trials (2). The recent 
failure of RCT
s of statin treatment to improve outcomes in 
mechanically ventilated sepsis patients (85) has caused many 
observers to abandon hope that statins will be effective in 
treating any form of acute critical illness. In the absence 
of clinical trial evidence showing that treating the host 
response actually works, these experiences remind us to 
remain cautious. The failure of corticosteroid treatment to 
reduce mortality in patients with severe influenza is well 
known (188). A recent RCT of statins in adults with dengue 
was unsuccessful (189). A trial of a TLR4 antagonist failed 
in patients with severe sepsis (190,191). An exploratory 
RCT of aspirin treatment of patients at risk of developing 
ARDS was abandoned because treatment was ineffective 
(192,193). Several factors could explain why these trial 
results were disappointing, including a low level of severe 
disease and mortality in the patient populations being 
studied (189). In addition, most of these trials were based on 
earlier experimental or observational studies that examined 
single agent treatment. Thus, another reason for their 
failure might be that none of them studied combination 
treatment with more than one drug. 
Treatments that target the infecting virus often bring 
modest benefits at best, as shown by the clinical trials in 
Ebola patients discussed above. A study of neuraminidase 
inhibitors in patients hospitalized during the influenza A 
H1N1 pandemic reduced overall hospital mortality by 19%, 
although mortality was reduced by approximately 50% in 
those who were treated within 2 days of symptom onset, 
something difficult to achieve in routine clinical care (194). 
By comparison, numerous experimental studies have shown 
that modifying the host response (e.g., cytokine knock-out) 
can dramatically improve survival without having any effect 
on virus load (121). 
Treating the host response with drugs that target 
endothelial (and perhaps epithelial) dysfunction represents 
an alternative and potentially more effective strategy for 
managing of a wide variety of emerging virus diseases (195). 
There is a good chance that a small number of inexpensive, 
generically produced and widely available drugs that modify 
common features of the host response to each of these 
viruses could be used in the syndromic treatment of them 
all (121,122,143,144).
Implications for treating the host response to 
other acute infectious diseases 
Observational studies suggest that treating the host response 
improves outcomes in patients hospitalized with sepsis, 
pneumonia and influenza, as discussed above. Because 
the host response to these diseases involves similar or 
overlapping mechanisms related to endothelial dysfunction, 
these findings suggest that in addition to treating emerging 
virus diseases, drugs like statins and ARBs might be used 
to treat patients with other, acute “everyday” infectious 
diseases in which similar mechanisms are involved. Some 
of these diseases occur only occasionally [e.g., Hantavirus 
pulmonary syndrome (15,186) or inhalation anthrax (187)], 
but others are far more common, especially in low-income 
countries. One of them is malaria. 
Clinical studies of severe and cerebral malaria (both 
falciparum and vivax) in children and adults treated 
with antimalarial drugs have documented endothelial 
dysfunction: decreased plasma levels of angpt-1, increased 
levels of angpt-2 and increased angpt-2/angpt-1 ratios 
(196-203). Other findings include elevated levels of several 
pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and other 
biomarkers indicating endothelial [vascular/intercellular 
adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1/ICAM-1), endothelial 
selectin (E-selectin)), coagulation (thrombomodulin) and 
complement (C5a) activation.
In experimental studies of cerebral malaria, mice infected 
with Plasmodium bergei ANKA develop neurological signs 
five to six days after infection. At the same time, signs 
of inflammation (increased pro-inflammatory cytokines 
and chemokines) and endothelial dysregulation become 
prominent. Under conditions where antimalarial treatment 
only partially reverses the course of illness, additional 
treatment with a statin (204-206) or another intervention 
(207,208) that affects endothelial cells reduces neuro-
inflammation, restores endothelial barrier integrity, and 
increases survival. Dysregulation of the Angpt/Tie2 
signaling axis is also seen in experimental P. berghei infection 
(32,209-211). Treatment with an antimalarial drug combined 
with either angopoietin-1 (210) or an ARB (irbesartan) (211) 
restores endothelial barrier integrity and improves survival. 
These clinical and experimental finding suggest that 
adjunctive treatments targeting endothelial dysfunction 
might improve outcomes in patients with severe and 
cerebral malaria (198,199). Earlier studies had shown that 
decreased endothelial nitric oxide (NO) was associated with 
severe and fatal malaria, but a recent RCT of inhaled NO

in malaria patients showed no effect on plasma levels of 
angpt-2, parasitemia or mortality (212). Given the response 
of Ebola patients to statin/ARB treatment discussed above, 
this combination should be considered for inclusion in a 
clinical trial of adjunctive treatment in malaria patients. 
T
wo additional observations in malaria patients may be 
relevant for Ebola treatment. First, endothelial dysfunction 
and systemic inflammation persist for many weeks after 
antimalarial treatment has cleared the circulation of 
parasitized red blood cells, and similar findings have 
been seen following non-malarial infections (213). These 
observations suggest that persistent endothelial dysfunction 
might contribute to post-Ebola syndrome and could be a 
target for treatment. 
Second, in a large study of Ebola patients, all of 
whom received antimalarial treatment with artemether-
lumefantrine, the presence of parasitemia was associated 
with a significant 20% increase in survival (214). This 
finding was independent of age and Ebola virus load, and 
the highest level of parasitemia was associated with an 83% 
survival rate. Several explanations for this “remarkable 
phenomenon” were suggested, including early up regulation 
of IFN-β, induction of NK cells, and dampening of the 
Ebola virus-induced cytokine storm (214). In an earlier 
study of Ebola patients, all of whom were given antimalarial 
treatment; those who were treated with artesunate-
amodiaquine had a 31% lower risk of mortality compared 
with those treated with artemether-lumefantrine (215). 
However, in mice infected with a mouse-adapted Ebola 
virus, treatment with all four antimalarials, either alone or 
in combination, had no effect on survival (214), indicating 
the drugs had no direct antiviral effect. Interestingly, 
artesunate is known to have broad immunomodulatory 
activities against microbial infections and inflammatory 
disorders. In a study of cerebral malaria in P. berghei-
infected mice, artesunate (but not mefloquine) improved 
survival by a mechanism that was independent of its 
antimalarial activity (216). In studies using murine VE cells, 
artesunate (I) inhibited NF-kappa B translocation to the 
nucleus; (II) down regulated the expression of ICAM-1; and 
(III) prevented parasitized red blood cells from attaching 
to endothelial cells. Taken together, these observations 
suggest that in Ebola patients, pre-existing malaria 
parasitemia might have provided a measure of protection 
against the effects of Ebola virus on endothelial barrier 
integrity by activating endothelial defence mechanisms 
(e.g., up regulating angpt-1 and down regulating angpt-2). 
Artesunate treatment itself might have had an additional, 
independent effect on endothelial barrier integrity. These 
mechanisms are plausible in light of the response of Ebola 
patients to statin/ARB treatment, a regimen that affects the 
Angpt/Tie2 signaling axis and improves endothelial barrier 
integrity. 
Ebola and “lessons learned” 
In evaluating the response to the H1N1 influenza 
pandemic in 2009, a WHO report concluded, “The world 
is ill prepared to respond to a severe influenza pandemic 
or to any similar global, sustained and threatening public 
health emergency” (217). The response to the Ebola 
outbreak in West Africa five years later showed that little 
had changed (218).
Many commentaries have examined the shortcomings of 
the international Ebola response, especially the response by 
WHO (e.g., 219,220). Four independent “lessons learned” 
reports have offered overlapping recommendations on 
how to structure a better WHO and international response 
for managing future epidemics and pandemics (221-224), 
and published summaries highlight their common features 
(225,226). Each report recommends strengthening national 
health systems and reorganizing and improving WHO’s 
governance and capacity to respond to emergencies. All 
of them recommend that WHO establish an independent 
Center for Emergency Preparedness and Response and 
create a contingency fund to support the rapid deployment 
of emergency response capabilities (225). They also 
emphasize the importance of system-wide accountability 
(e.g., WHO, the United Nations and The World Bank) 
to ensure an effective global response to future health 
emergencies. 
The four “lessons learned” reports also offer several 
recommendations for accelerating R&D, and in each report 
WHO is expected to play a major role (225). WHO has 
developed its own R&D Blueprint that aims to “reduce 
the time between the declaration of an international public 
health emergency and the availability of effective tests, 
vaccines, antivirals and other treatments…” (227). This 
R&D Blueprint will serve as “a convening mechanism for 
public health officials, scientists, and product developers, 
and an instrument to articulate technical guidance for R&D 
preparedness and response” (227). In doing so, WHO hopes 
to fulfil its “global mandate to set evidence-based priorities 
and standards for research, ensuring that all voices are heard 
and avoiding conflicts of interest” (227).

be found in the report of the Commission on a Global 
Health Risk Framework for the Future (223). The GHRF 
Commission calls for establishing a Pandemic Product 
Development Committee (PPDC) that will be accountable 
to a T
echnical Governing Board under the supervision of 
WHO and it’s Director-General. The PPDC would seek 
the participation of national regulatory authorities, industry, 
research organizations, and other public and private 
stakeholders to promote regulatory convergence, pre-
approve clinical trial designs, manage intellectual property 
and product liability, and expedite the manufacturing 
and distribution of vaccines, treatments and diagnostics. 
Adequate funding for this enterprise will be essential, 
and might require establishing a new global financing 
mechanism for innovation (228). T
wo reports suggest this 
effort would cost at least $1 billion per year (223-225). 
None of the Ebola “lessons learned” reports mentions 
the statins/ARB experience in Sierra Leone and what it 
might mean for clinical trials of treatments that target the 
host response (218-230). Instead, the reports call for R&D 
on new treatments that seem to focus exclusively on new, 
experimental agents that target only the virus and will 
undoubtedly require extensive investment (221,223-225). 
Moreover, the recommendations for coordinating this research 
call for a prominent role for WHO, which firmly rejected 
the idea of studying treatments that target the host response 
to Ebola and which has never convened a meeting to provide 
“technical guidance for R&D preparedness and response” 
that includes treating the host response (122,149,227; DS 
Fedson, unpublished observations). Not surprisingly, WHO 
has realistically concluded “most individual funding agencies 
are likely to make decisions on a case by case basis, in line with 
their mandates and mission” (227).
Several Ebola experts have objected to the publication of 
reports describing the treatment experience in Sierra Leone 
(143,144), saying these reports do not constitute evidence 
of protection (DS Fedson, unpublished observations). 
These critics have not explained why they have opposed 
undertaking clinical trials to obtain the data they now 
demand, or why they have shown no interest in validating 
what reportedly happened to Ebola patients who were 
treated in Sierra Leone. 
Clinical trials of new treatments
T
esting new treatments in the midst of a severe outbreak 
is fraught with difficulty. The clinical trials that were 
undertaken during the Ebola outbreak required large-
scale international collaboration and were very expensive 
 
(151-153,229). One notable development was expansion of 
the activities of the International Severe Acute Respiratory 
and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) (229,230). 
ISARIC developed a set of pre-approved and adaptable 
syndrome-based protocols for clinical research and clinical 
trials that are available online to its member networks in 
Africa and beyond. ISARIC and its affiliated Platform for 
European Preparedness Against (Re-)emerging Epidemics 
(PREPARE) have developed relationships with funders 
and other organizations that support training and capacity 
development (230). These developments address many of 
the administrative, regulatory, legal and ethical difficulties 
that could otherwise impede a rapid research response 
during future outbreaks. 
When testing new treatments in the setting of an Ebola-
like outbreak, a classical 1:1 RCT will seldom be appropriate 
or even feasible, so choosing an alternative trial design 
becomes vitally important. As noted recently, “While the 
scientific merits of RCTs are powerful, advocates for them 
have not paid enough attention to competing factors that 
shape research ethics, such as the need for clinical equipoise 
in starting an RCT, the weakness of knowledge gained 
when small sample sizes prevail and available supportive 
care is given to all, the importance of rapidly finding what 
agent is best among competitors rather than insisting on 
starting from scratch as RCTs do, and retaining community 
trust in participating in any RCT with a control arm. 
Addressing these concerns is crucially important if any trials 
are to succeed in very challenging circumstances” (231). 
 
All of these issues became evident during the recent Ebola 
clinical trials. 
During the Ebola outbreak, a consensus emerged in favor 
of adaptive trial designs that would minimize the number 
of patients who would receive less than effective treatment 
and at the same time accelerate the discovery of one or 
more treatments that would best improve patient survival 
 
(232-234). The statins/ARB treatment experience in Sierra 
Leone suggests, however, that an adaptive trial design might 
not be needed. Historical observations show that the effects 
of many treatments can be so dramatic that bias can be 
ruled out (235); in these instances, “the observations speak 
for themselves” (236). The question that must then be asked 
is “how much difference between treatment outcome and 
the natural outcome is enough?” (236). Simulation studies 
show that “implausibly large associations, both between 
treatment and confounding factor and between confounding 
factor and outcome, are generally required to explain risks

beyond relative rates of 5–10”, and “rate ratios beyond 10 
are highly likely to reflect real treatment effects” (236). 
Compared with historical controls, survival rates in Ebola 
patients treated with the statin/ARB combination were of 
this order of magnitude (143,144). Thus, it could be argued 
that in a future outbreak of Ebola (or Ebola-like disease), an 
adaptive design clinical trial of a statin/ARB-like treatment 
regimen might not be needed. 
If nothing else, the experience in Sierra Leone suggests 
that the clinical equipoise needed to justify a RCT of 
a treatment targeting the host response to Ebola virus 
infection may no longer exist. Moreover, RCT
s “bring final 
quantification, (but) they offer little scientific novelty in 
themselves. Before an idea can be confirmed or quantified, it 
has first to be discovered. For true intellectual advancement, 
i.e., in proposing new problems, new solutions, or new 
ideas… (it is case reports and case series that suggest)… 
mechanisms (and) therapeutic surprises” (237). The case 
series of Ebola patients who were treated with a statin/ARB 
combination constitutes such a surprise. 
Suggestions for treatment research
There is an obvious need for effective drugs to treat each of 
the emerging virus diseases that threaten to cause epidemics 
or pandemics. Important lessons have been learned from 
studies of treatments for influenza, sepsis, pneumonia and 
Ebola, as discussed above. Most of these studies have been 
observational in design, which means that compared with 
RCTs they have well recognized limitations (e.g., healthy 
user bias, confounding by indication and other unmeasured 
confounding variables) (238-240). Nonetheless, physicians 
know that “nearly all clinical decisions involve probabilistic 
reasoning, …so a realistic goal for observational research 
may not be the high standard set by RCTs but instead 
the level of certainty needed to influence a … treatment 
decision” (240). This admonition is especially important 
given the short time frame (a few weeks at most) for studies 
that evaluate treatment outcomes in acute critical illness. 
Ebola follow up and post-Ebola syndrome 
A recurrence of acute Ebola virus disease is still 
possible, and plans should be made for clinical studies of 
experimental and generic treatments if this occurs. In the 
meantime, the statin/ARB treatment experience in Sierra 
Leone should be evaluated and the findings independently 
validated (143,144). If validated, a conventional clinical 
trial of statin/ARB treatment might not be necessary (see 
discussion above). 
The dimensions of post-Ebola syndrome also need 
to be defined: the duration of virus persistence and the 
long-term effects of uveitis, arthritis, and neurologic 
complications (241). Several follow up studies to do this 
are now underway. Although it is unclear whether antiviral 
agents will be needed to clear the virus, investigators should 
not overlook the possibility that statins, ARBs and drugs 
like clomiphene could be useful in treating the post-Ebola 
complications seen in these patients (242-245). Investigators 
should also consider the possibility that post-Ebola 
syndrome might share features in common with chronic 
critical illness due to other causes (246). 
Cellular mechanisms that support virus replication
In clinical studies, treatments that target the virus have 
been only modestly effective, yet antiviral treatments are 
still the focus of new research strategies, including drug 
repurposing (247). If new antivirals must be specific for 
each individual virus, this approach to research has many 
disadvantages. One way to overcome this problem might be 
to discover drugs that target common cellular mechanisms 
that support virus replication. As proposed for influenza 
viruses (248), this approach would minimize the possibility 
of virus resistance, would (presumably) work only in virus-
infected cells (see below), would likely reduce unwanted 
side effects, and could include several drugs that are already 
licensed for treating other diseases. Suggested cellular 
targets for influenza antiviral intervention include (I) the 
Raf/MEK/ERK kinase and p38 MAPK kinase pathways and 
(II) the IKK/NF-kappaB pathway. Cell culture studies of 
several unlicensed agents that down regulate these pathways 
have given promising results (248). Interestingly, there 
is considerable molecular cross-talk between these two 
pathways in endothelial cells (249), epithelial cells (250), and 
macrophages (251). In each of these cells and in rat kidneys 
in vivo (252), statins down regulate both of these pathways. 
Statins also prevent Ang II-induced endothelial dysfunction 
by inhibiting p38 MAPK (253,254). In addition, ARBs 
inhibit the RAF/MEK/ERK and p38 MAPK pathways 
(255-257). Finally, in septic mice, giving an ARB 30 minutes 
after cecal ligation and puncture inhibited NF-kappa B, p38 
MAPK and ERK1/2, reduced levels of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines in lung tissue, and significantly improved 
 
survival (258). Considered together, these findings suggest 
that in influenza and perhaps other emerging virus diseases,

Page 16 of 29
treatment with statins and ARBs would have much broader 
effects on the host response than simply interfering with the 
cellular machinery necessary for virus replication. These 
effects deserve to be studied in animal models of these 
diseases. 
Biomarker studies 
An important discussion is taking place among critical care 
investigators regarding the utility of biomarkers in guiding 
their studies. This discussion has been prompted by (I) the 
failure of clinical trials in sepsis and ARDS to identify new 
treatments that will improve patient outcomes (2); and (II) 
the availability of several new laboratory and computational 
technologies that allow investigators to identify an 
increasingly large number of biomarkers that might inform 
their clinical studies. 
Investigators recognize there is substantial variation 
in the host response to critical illness. To address this 
heterogeneity, one group of investigators believes that by 
using the techniques of integrated genomics (e.g., mapping 
gene expression as expression quantitative trait loci) they 
can define “subgroups of patients with different immune 
response states and prognosis … (that will provide) …
new insights into the pathogenesis of sepsis and create 
opportunities for … precision medicine … to target 
therapeutic inventions and improve sepsis outcomes” (259). 
These techniques can be used to define patient subgroups 
that show greater immunosuppression and higher mortality. 
They are also said to be more precise than definitions based 
on clinical criteria alone. 
Another group of investigators has taken up the 
challenge of “rethinking strategies” for clinical trial design 
by contrasting “lumpers” and “splitters” (260). Lumpers 
assemble heterogeneous groups of patients using simple 
syndromic definitions, but they are unable to identify 
subgroups within trial populations that have specific 
dysregulation of immune pathways or poorer outcomes. 
By contrast, splitters are interested in identifying specific 
subtypes in order to “match the right treatment to the right 
patients” (260). To address these conflicting views, the 
investigators propose three strategies to improve clinical 
trial design: practical enrichment (i.e., decrease “noise” 
in clinical trials), prognostic enrichment (i.e., identify 
subgroups at higher risk) and predictive enrichment (i.e., 
identify patients who will respond best to treatment). They 
believe that “different treatments require different target 
populations” (260). Because these populations cannot be 
identified beforehand, they argue that high-throughput 
searches can be used to identify biomarkers of therapeutic 
responsiveness that could inform clinical trial design. They 
believe that “tightly defined criteria enriching for treatment 
benefit will be the key to advancing treatment for sepsis and 
ARDS”, and advocate moving beyond a “one-size-fits-all” 
approach to treatment research (260). 
Although the discussion of the role of biomarkers 
summarized above is thoughtful, it is important to 
ask whether treatment advances that require “greater 
personalization of care” (260) will be relevant to discovering 
new ways to treat patients with emerging virus diseases. 
T
o be useful, tests for biomarkers must be rapid, highly 
accurate and inexpensive. Furthermore, investigators must 
not overlook “evidence-based treatments that are broadly 
applicable”, and recognize that “substantial investments into 
disease subtyping have not always translated in effective 
targeted treatments” (260). In all likelihood, many if not 
most emerging virus diseases will first (or eventually) affect 
people in low- and middle-income countries. It is not clear 
whether an approach to treatment discovery that is based on 
“precision” or “personalized” medicine will in any practical 
sense meet their needs. 
A different approach to treatment research 
The search for ways to treat patients with Ebola virus 
disease is still dominated by a focus on drugs that target the 
virus (261,262). The Ebola “lessons learned” reports call for 
huge investments that (it is hoped) will lead to the discovery 
of novel therapeutic agents (223-225). The reports call for 
this research to be coordinated at an international level, 
with active leadership by WHO. Given the failures outlined 
in the “lessons learned” reports and the disappointing 
results from clinical trials of investigational treatments in 
West Africa (150-154), it is important to ask what should be 
done when “underperforming big ideas in research become 
entrenched” (263). 
The ideas of “precision” or “personalized” medicine 
and the technologies on which they are based have become 
central to the research of many scientists, and they are 
widely accepted by institutions that support their work. 
Yet, for all of their complexity and promise, systems 
biology and personalized medicine have significant 
intellectual limitations (264-266). Enormous waste has 
been documented in biomedical (267) and clinical (268) 
research. Moreover, introducing a new scientific idea can 
be difficult (269): just ask an investigator who has prepared

a grant proposal or tried to publish a paper describing 
it. Empirical research shows that evaluators of research 
proposals systematically downgrade those that seek to 
explore new ideas (270). Social influences, behavioral 
bias and herding instincts among scientists “distort the 
evolution of knowledge if scientists are reluctant to accept 
an alternative explanation for their observations” (269). 
Instead, a propensity for “cognitive cronyism” (270) tends 
to exclude new ideas from consideration. Among other 
things, the reputational and/or financial costs of doing so 
can be very large.
The laboratory and clinical studies reviewed in this 
article suggest that an approach to treatment discovery 
based on the phenotypic benefits observed in patients 
who have been treated with inexpensive generic drugs like 
statins and ARBs has much to offer populations that will 
be affected by emerging virus diseases. This idea has not 
required RCTs to establish its validity (271). Instead, it is 
based on an acceptance of the (I) findings of reductionist 
scientists whose laboratory studies suggest plausible 
mechanisms for the pathophysiology of these diseases; (II) 
laboratory evidence of how these treatments work; and 
(III) observations of physicians and clinical epidemiologists 
showing that these treatments work in patients with several 
types of critical illness. 
The relevance of this approach for treating patients 
who in the future might become infected with an emerging 
virus is based on existing knowledge of pathophysiological 
mechanisms shared by all of these viruses and how 
these mechanisms are affected by treatment (272). 
 
More specifically, the studies reviewed here focus on (I) 
the cellular targets of several forms of critical disease 
(endothelial and epithelial cells); (II) the shared mechanisms 
of molecular dysfunction found in these diseases (the Angpt/
Tie2 and ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas signaling axes); and 
(III) two inexpensive and widely available generic drugs 
(statins and ARBs) that target the dysfunctional signaling 
pathways common to these and other diseases caused by 
emerging viruses. Although endothelial dysfunction has 
been a principal focus of much of this research (273,274), 
the diseases themselves are systemic in nature, and the 
effects of statin and ARB treatment on the host response are 
widespread and complex. 
One area of research that is relevant to all of these 
diseases and that has received increasing attention is 
immunometabolism: the study of the relationship between 
systemic and cellular metabolism and how it affects immune 
cell function (275,276). Statins and ARBs have broad and 
well-known anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory 
activities (5,6), but they also affect immunometabolic 
pathways. For example, oxidative phosphorylation and 
fatty acid oxidation are characteristic of M2 macrophages 
(276). Statins and ARBs reduce oxidative stress (277), ARBs 
promote fatty acid oxidation (278), and both are associated 
with M2 macrophage phenotypes (279,280). Statins affect 
T cell polarization by favoring T regulatory cells over 
Th17 cells (276,281). In addition, AMP-activated protein 
kinase (AMPK) acts as a master regulator of cellular energy 
balance by maintaining glucose and lipid homeostasis (275). 
AMPK is up regulated by statins (282) and ARBs (278). 
These are just a few of the many ways that statins and ARBs 
affect immunometabolic pathways. 
Conclusions 
The Ebola experience in West Africa is a reminder of the 
ongoing threat of emerging viruses that could cause severe 
epidemics or pandemics. The international response to 
the Ebola crisis has been widely criticized, not least for the 
earlier failure to develop vaccines and treatments that could 
have mitigated its devastating impact. The reasons for this 
failure are understandable: an outbreak of this magnitude 
was historically unprecedented, Ebola vaccines and 
treatments were perceived as having no commercial value, 
and other ongoing problems (e.g., malaria, HIV/AIDS) 
demanded attention. 
The international response to the Ebola crisis, like the 
response to the 2009 influenza pandemic, has been to call 
for a series of “top down” efforts to dramatically upgrade 
healthcare systems (especially surveillance), and make large-
scale investments in internationally coordinated programs 
to develop new vaccines and treatments. Little thought 
seems to have been given to the difficulty of choosing 
which of the many virus threats should receive priority or, 
if vaccines and treatments could be developed, how they 
might be used. For example, the much-heralded success 
of the Ebola vaccine trial in Guinea (283) depended on an 
existing human infrastructure that made ring vaccination 
possible: accurate contact tracing and tracing the contacts 
of all contacts. This human infrastructure will not exist in 
most countries when a new epidemic or pandemic virus first 
appears. Moreover, it will be impossible to vaccinate entire 
populations beforehand when the identity of the virus that 
might eventually emerge is not known. In all likelihood, 
these vaccines will first be given to laboratory and healthcare 
workers, and only later to populations at risk.

The development of new drugs that target emerging 
viruses also faces significant limitations. If they are to be 
specific for each virus, the identity of the next epidemic or 
pandemic virus will not be known, so choosing which drug 
to develop will be a matter of guesswork. If newly developed 
antiviral drugs have broad-spectrum activity, they will still 
be expensive, in limited supply, and unfamiliar to most 
physicians. Furthermore, they might be no more effective 
than the agents that were tested against Ebola (150-154). 
A conference held in November 2015 considered (once 
again) the lessons that should be learned from the Ebola 
crisis and how they might guide the response to future 
outbreaks (284). In considering the need for coordinated 
research, experts agreed that an effective response required 
more than the input from biomedical scientists; it also 
required the contributions of engineers, social scientists 
and ethicists. Yet, the examples given for needed research 
were biomedical: (I) studies of the human-animal interface; 
(II) contributions of molecular virology and immunology 
to understanding population herd immunity (this was 
considered a crucial area for research); and (III) better 
vaccines and treatments (although only vaccines were 
discussed). Once again, the emphasis was on “top down” 
international cooperation and synergistic action led by 
WHO. There was no mention of the need for research on 
treating the host response. 
The idea of treating the host response to an emerging 
virus disease is at least a decade old (120-122,285,286), 
but it has received little or no attention from WHO, other 
international institutions, and the scientific community 
(142; DS Fedson, unpublished observations). Nonetheless, 
phenotypic observations by physicians and clinical 
epidemiologists suggest that one or more inexpensive 
and widely available generic drugs could be used to treat 
patients with many infections that are severe enough to 
require hospital care (Table 6). These orally administered 
drugs are known to be safe when given to patients with 
acute critical illness. Because they are used routinely to treat 
Table 6 Considerations for establishing whether inexpensive and widely available generic drugs could be used to reduce mortality from emerging 
virus diseases that threaten to cause epidemics and pandemics
The threat of emerging virus diseases that could cause epidemics and pandemics is ongoing, but preparedness efforts have been and will 
continue to be inadequate
Recommendations for “top down” reform of national and international health care systems are well meaning, but implementation will be 
difficult and costly
Developing specific treatments that target each emerging virus disease will be complex, difficult, and unlikely to succeed
A “bottom up” approach to treating common features of the host response to emerging virus infections is possible, but achieving its 
promise will require laboratory and clinical research
Reductionist science has explained many mechanisms involved in the host response, but it has yet to identify inexpensive and widely 
available drugs that would be practical to use in patient treatment in countries with limited healthcare services
Phenotypic observations by clinicians and clinical epidemiologists have identified several inexpensive generic drugs that modify the host 
response to critical illness and improve survival
These generic drugs should be tested, both alone and in combination, in animal models of emerging virus diseases and other models of 
acute “everyday” critical illness (e.g., sepsis, influenza, pneumonia)
Promising drugs should be further investigated to define the molecular mechanisms that explain their effectiveness
Companies that produce these generic drugs should be identified to determine their production and surge capacities, logistical systems 
for global distribution, and costs to public programs
An international process should be established to monitor and/or coordinate the distribution of these generic drugs in everyday use and in 
the event of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern
Public and foundation funding should support laboratory and clinical research and the development of clinical trial protocols and 
infrastructures for testing generic drugs that could be used to treat patients with: 
acute “everyday” critical illness (e.g., sepsis, seasonal influenza, pneumonia), and 
acute critical illness that occurs immediately after the emergence of a new virus that threatens to cause a severe epidemic or pandemic

patients with cardiovascular diseases, they are familiar to 
physicians everywhere. In addition to treating patients with 
acute critical illness, experience with outpatient treatment 
in patients with influenza (Table 3) (130), sepsis (79) and 
pneumonia (Table 1) (3) suggests that these drugs might also 
be used in prophylaxis; for example, they could be given to 
healthcare workers and contacts of patients with Ebola virus 
disease.
The laboratory and clinical research needed to study 
this approach to treatment does not require “top down” 
international coordination. Many reports show it could 
be undertaken by individual scientists or groups of 
investigators, many of whom could and should come from 
low- and middle-income countries (287). If their research 
conclusively demonstrates the effectiveness of these drugs, 
they could be used to treat patients infected with many 
emerging viruses. Because these drugs are generic and 
inexpensive, global supplies are huge. Consequently, they 
could be used in any country that has a basic healthcare 
system, and treatment could be given on the very first 
epidemic or pandemic day. 
There is a strong possibility that a “bottom up” 
approach to treatment using inexpensive generic drugs 
could reduce mortality in the next Ebola-like epidemic or 
the next influenza pandemic. In doing so, it could make an 
immeasurable contribution to global health, global equity 
and global security.
