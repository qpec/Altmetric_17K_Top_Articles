Abstract
Background
Hypercholesterolemia is a well-established risk factor for coronary heart disease, but the
association between cholesterol level change and mortality is not fully understood. We
aimed to investigate the association of 2 year (2002–2003 to 2004–2005) change in choles-
terol with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in a population-based cohort study.
Methods and findings
The study population consisted of 269,391 participants aged more than 40 years who were
free of myocardial infarction, stroke and cancer using the Korean National Health Insurance
Service—National Health Screening Cohort. Cholesterol levels were classified into 1st, 2nd
and 3rd tertiles during each of the first and second health examinations, respectively. The
participants were followed-up for all-cause and cause-specific mortality from 1 January 2006
to 31 December 2013. Compared to participants who stayed within the 2nd tertile group for
cholesterol during both the first and second examinations, participants who became or main-
tained cholesterol levels to the 1st tertile during the second examination had increased risk
of all-cause mortality [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) =
1.28 (1.18–1.38) in 1st/1st, 1.16 (1.07–1.26) in 2nd/1st and 1.47 (1.32–1.64) in 3rd/1st tertile
levels, respectively]. In addition, increased or persistent high cholesterol levels to the 3rd ter-
tile was associated with elevated risk for all-cause mortality [aHR (95% CI) = 1.10 (1.01–
1.20) in 1st/2nd, 1.16(1.03–1.31) in 1st/3rd and 1.15(1.05–1.25) in 3rd/3rd tertile levels].
Conclusions
Changes in cholesterol levels in either direction to low cholesterol or persistently low choles-
terol levels were associated with higher risk of mortality. Particularly, spontaneous decline in
cholesterol levels may be a marker for worsening health conditions.

 Introduction
Hypercholesterolemia is a well-established risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) [1, 2],
indicating that cholesterol lowering therapy would be beneficial for prevention of CHD [3].
However, previous studies on the association between cholesterol levels and mortality have
shown inconsistent results that vary according to age, cause of death, and sex [4–8]. Previous
findings indicate that that low cholesterol was associated with high mortality [6, 7]. For exam-
ple, among the elderly, frailty or poor health status may have contributed to the increased risk
of death among those with low cholesterol levels [9]. In addition, other previous studies have
revealed a U-shaped relationship between cholesterol and mortality [10, 11]. Interestingly, the
increased risk of death among those with low cholesterol was due to non-vascular disease,
such as liver disease [12] or cancer [13], which is in contrast to the high contribution of cardio-
vascular disease (CVD) related mortality among those with high cholesterol levels [11].
A number of studies investigated the association between the change in cholesterol levels
and mortality [5, 8]. A study from the Honolulu Heart Program revealed a 30% increase in
mortality among people who had decreased levels of cholesterol [5]. The most common causes
of deaths among those with declines in cholesterol levels were malignancies of the hematopoi-
etic system, esophagus, and prostate and non-malignant liver disease. However, this study was
limited to a relatively small number of male subjects (n = 5,941). In a study using the Framing-
ham data, those with decreasing cholesterol levels were associated with increased risk of all-
cause and CVD mortality [8]. Spontaneous decline in cholesterol of 14 mg/dL during 14-years
was associated with 11% increased risk of mortality, compared to those with stable or increased
cholesterol levels. However, previous studies have been mainly performed in the Western pop-
ulation and the number of study population is relatively small.
In this study, we aimed to elucidate the association between change in cholesterol and all-
cause mortality as well as cause-specific mortality using a nationally representative cohort.
Methods
Data source
National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) in the Republic of Korea covers approximately 97%
of the Korean population and provides biennial health screening examinations called the
National Health Screening Program (NHSP) to all enrollees above 40 years old [14]. The
NHSP offers screening tests for several conditions, including anemia, liver disease and kidney
disease as well as cardiovascular risk factors including blood pressure, lipid profile and fasting
glucose. The National Health Insurance Service—National Health Screening Cohort (NHIS-
HEALS) database is composed of demographic factors, results from the NHSP, utilization of
medical facilities at outpatient and inpatient settings with the International Classification of
Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) codes and the date and cause of death from the Korea
National Statistical Office. In addition, NHIS-HEALS contains demographic information such
as age, gender, health insurance premium, and disability. The NHIS database has been widely
used in multiple epidemiological studies [15, 16] and its validity is described in detail else-
where [17].
Study population
The NHIS-HEALS database consists of about 510,000 randomly selected participants among
the general population over 40 years ages who underwent health screening examinations in
2002 or 2003 and followed-up until 31 December 2013. We identified 334,058 participants who
had cholesterol values in the first (2002–2003) and second (2004–2005) health examination

 periods. We excluded those who passed away (n = 1,032) before the index date of 1 January
2006. In addition, we also excluded those who were diagnosed with myocardial infarction (MI)
or stroke (n = 38,748), reported a history of MI, stroke or cancer before the index date
(n = 4,058) or had missing data on laboratory results and lifestyle variables (n = 12,689). Fur-
thermore, we excluded statin users (n = 15,140), who were defined as those with more than 30
cumulative defined daily dose (cDDD) of statins during 2002 to 2005 to investigate the associa-
tion between spontaneous change of cholesterol levels and mortality, since we assumed that
decreased cholesterol with statins or without statins may be differently associated with mortality
[18]. Therefore, final study population consisted of 262,391 participants (Fig 1).
This study was approved by Seoul National University Hospital’s institutional review board
(IRB number: 1703-039-863), and consent from individual patients was waived as NHIS-
HEALS was anonymized according to strict confidentiality guidelines. This study was
approved by NHIS (NHIS-2017-2-456)
Change in cholesterol level
Total cholesterol levels were measured at each health examination after fasting for at least 8
hours. Baseline (2002–2003) cholesterol levels were classified into 1st (< 182 mg/dL), 2nd
(182–212 mg/dL) and 3rd tertiles (� 212 mg/dL). In addition, follow-up (2004–2005) choles-
terol levels were classified into 1st tertile (< 181 mg/dL), 2nd tertile (181–210 mg/dL) and 3rd
tertile (� 211 mg/dL). Participants who stayed in the 2nd tertile group for both the initial and
second health examination periods were considered the reference group.
Outcome assessment
Deaths from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2013 were determined by using death certificates
from the National Statistical Office of Korea. The causes of deaths were categorized into CVD
(ICD-10 codes I00-I99) and cancer (ICD-10 C00-C97) according to the ICD-10 codes.

 Covariates
Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared and
grouped into < 25 kg/m2 and � 25 kg/m2 according to Asian-Pacific cut-off points [19].
Smoking status was classified into never, former and current smokers. Alcohol consumption
was divided into none or at least one drink per week. Insurance premium divided into quin-
tiles was used to classify household income status. The presence of disability was based on
National Registration for Disability. Comorbidities were summarized by the Charlson comor-
bidity index (CCI) [20] using ICD-10 codes from 2002 to 2005. History of hypertension and
diabetes were defined as having reported being previously diagnosed with or taking anti-
hypertensive or anti-diabetic medications.
Statistical analyses
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables and Chi-squared test for categorical
variables were used to compare baseline characteristics according to baseline cholesterol levels.
Continuous variables are expressed as mean [standard deviation (SD)]. We used the Cox-
regression hazard model to evaluate the risk of mortality according to the change in cholesterol
levels. We adjusted for age and sex in model 1. In model 2, we additionally adjusted life style
variables (BMI, smoking status and drinking status), socioeconomic factors (household
income and disability) and medical conditions (CCI, history of hypertension and diabetes, sys-
tolic blood pressure and fasting glucose level). We performed sensitivity analysis by excluding
deaths that occurred within the first two years from the index date to account for the possibil-
ity of reverse-causality. All data processing and statistical analyses were carried out using SAS
9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and STATA 14.1 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA),
respectively.
Results
Baseline characteristics
The mean age of the total population was 54 (SD 8.8) years and were composed of 153,759
(58.6%) male subjects (Table 1). The mean cholesterol level at baseline was 198.0 (SD 36.1)
mg/dL in 2002–2003 and 196.6 (SD 35.2) mg/dL in 2004–2005 with 0.57 (Standard error,
0.001) correlation coefficient for cholesterol. Subjects in the baseline 3rd tertile cholesterol
levels were more likely to be old, female, obese (� 25 kg/m2) and to have higher systolic
blood pressure and fasting blood glucose compared to those in the 1st and 2nd tertiles for
cholesterol.
Change in cholesterol and mortality
The mean follow-up period was 8.0 years and the mean time to death was 4.7 years. There was
a U-shaped relationship between baseline cholesterol levels and all-cause mortality [adjusted
HR (aHR) = 1.13; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.06–1.20 in 1st tertile, aHR = 1.15; 95%
CI = 1.08–1.22 in 3rd tertile], compared to 2nd tertile at baseline (S1 Table) (S1 Fig).
Subjects with persistent 1st tertile cholesterol levels and increasing cholesterol levels from
the 1st tertile to the 2nd and 3rd tertile levels during the follow-up period were associated with
increased risk of all-cause mortality [aHR (95% CI) = 1.28 (1.18–1.38), 1.10 (1.01–1.20) and
1.16 (1.03–1.31), respectively] compared to those with persistent 2nd tertile levels (Table 2).
Subjects with decreasing cholesterol levels from 3rd tertile levels to 1st and 2nd and persistent
3rd tertile levels were associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality [aHR (95% CI) =
1.47 (1.32–1.64), 1.15 (1.05–1.26) and 1.15 (1.05–1.25), respectively] compared to those with

 persistent 2nd tertile levels. Decreasing cholesterol from 2nd tertile to 1st tertile levels was
associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality [aHR (95% CI) = 1.16 (1.07–1.26)]. These
associations were prominent in groups less than 65 years old or men (S2 Table). Among statin
users (n = 15,140), those with persistent 1st tertile cholesterol levels were associated with high
all-cause mortality. (S3 Table).

 The risk of CVD mortality was elevated in those with persistent 3rd tertile levels and
increasing cholesterol levels from 1st tertile to 3rd tertile levels [aHR (95% CI) = 1.30 (1.05–
1.61) and 1.47 (1.10–1.98), respectively]. Subjects with persistent 1st tertile levels and decreas-
ing cholesterol levels from 3rd tertile to 1st tertile levels were associated with high CVD mor-
tality risk [aHR (95% CI) 1.37 (1.12–1.67) and 1.43 (1.08–1.89), respectively].
Increased risk of cancer mortality was observed those in persistent 1st tertile levels and
decreasing cholesterol levels from 3rd tertile to 1st tertile levels [aHR (95% CI) = 1.34 (1.19–
1.50) and 1.26 (1.06–1.50)].
Sensitivity analysis
In the sensitivity analysis of excluding deaths within the first two years of follow-up
(n = 2,069), increased risks of all-cause mortality, CVD mortality and cancer mortality were
consistently observed in subjects with persistent 1st tertile levels [aHR (95% CI) = 1.27 (1.17–
1.39), 1.36 (1.10–1.69) and 1.35 (1.19–1.53)] compared to those with persistent 2nd tertile
levels (Table 3). Moreover, decreasing cholesterol levels from 2nd and 3rd tertile to 1st tertile
levels were significantly associated with high all-cause mortality risk. On the other hand,
increasing cholesterol levels from 1st tertile to 2nd and 3rd tertile levels were associated with
high all-cause mortality [aHR (95% CI) = 1.11 (1.01–1.22) and 1.15 (1.01–1.31)].
Discussion
We demonstrated that subjects with both decreasing cholesterol levels and persistently low
cholesterol levels were significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality
compared to those remaining at a stable middle cholesterol level. In addition, subjects with

 increasing cholesterol levels and persistently high cholesterol were associated with high all-
cause mortality risk. CVD mortality according to change in cholesterol showed similar pat-
terns with all-cause mortality. On the other hand, cancer mortality risk was elevated in those
with persistently low and decreasing cholesterol levels.
Recent studies have found an inverse association between cholesterol level and mortality [9,
21–24]. However, it is uncertain whether low cholesterol level contributes to increased risk of
mortality or is rather a surrogate marker for other serious illnesses. A longitudinal study in
Denmark showed that severe diseases that could lower total cholesterol might increase mortal-
ity [21]. In addition, high cholesterol was associated with lower non-CVD mortality such as
cancer mortality in subjects with age � 65 years [23]. A study in patients with end stage renal
disease suggested that systemic inflammation and malnutrition may explain this inverse asso-
ciation through cytokines related to acute or chronic inflammation which contribute low cho-
lesterol levels and higher mortality [25].
Decline in cholesterol levels from high to low tertile within 2 years might be related to con-
ditions that can alter cholesterol homeostasis including uptake, synthesis and storage. Further-
more, decline in cholesterol levels consequently can lead increased susceptibility to fatal
diseases [9] by dysfunction in cellular functions [26]. In our study, cancer mortality was higher
in those with sustained low tertile of cholesterol levels or steep decline (from 3rd to1st tertile
levels) within 2 years. Increased lipid uptake in cancer cells may account for this steep decline.
Cancer cells have an increasing requirement for lipids in order to reduce the fluidity of cell
membranes and increase chemotherapy resistance by saturating the cell membrane with lipid,
thereby increasing their chances of survival [27].
Besides cancer mortality, low total cholesterol was associated with high CVD mortality in
prospective cohort studies [10, 28, 29]. This study also showed that low cholesterol levels as
well as high cholesterol levels were associated with high CVD mortality. We could not verify
the exact reasons for this result, but many previous studies have suggested that 1) this is due to
chance findings or reverse epidemiology [10]; 2) the effects of malnutrition, a risk factor for
non-ischemic heart disease [28]; 3) subfractions, particularly for low levels of high density lipo-
protein-cholesterol (HDL-C) [29]. In patients with acute MI, significant decreases in total cho-
lesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and HDL-C levels were reported,
although the causes were not clear [30].
There are several limitations in our study that need to be considered. First, we could not
evaluate lipoprotein subfractions such as HDL-C and LDL-C, due the lack of data [22]. Sec-
ond, possibility of day-to day variability due to laboratory error or biologic variability may
exist, as we used single cholesterol measurement. Repeated measurement would be more accu-
rate to classify the subjects [31]. Furthermore, while there might be possibility of increasing or
decreasing trends of cholesterol levels due to life style change in Korean population, such as
change of dietary patterns or increasing trends of obesity, we used classification of tertiles for
first and second examination, separately and there was no substantial change in average cho-
lesterol from 1998 to 2010 in Korean [32]. Third, we cannot rule out the possibility of reverse
causality. Although we have excluded deaths within first 2 years from index date to resolve
reverse causality, there might be other predisposing conditions that can cause steep decline of
cholesterol in short periods. Fourth, the changes in cholesterol levels may reflect a ‘regression
to the mean’ rather than any biologic effect [33].
In conclusion, decreasing cholesterol levels or persistently low cholesterol levels were asso-
ciated with higher risk of all-cause, cancer and CVD mortality. In addition, increasing choles-
terol levels or persistently high cholesterol levels was also associated with high CVD mortality
risk. This suggests that decreased cholesterol and low cholesterol levels may be an indicator for
poor health status. The clinical implication of this study is that individuals with spontaneously

 decreased cholesterol or persistently low cholesterol levels are at increased risk of mortality
and may require careful attention for signs of deterioration of health [8].
