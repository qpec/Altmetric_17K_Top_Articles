Ondansetron Use in Pregnancy and
Birth Defects
A Systematic Review
Shaun D. Carstairs, MD, FACMT
OBJECTIVE: To examine the risk of birth defects in
children born to women who used ondansetron early
in pregnancy for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy or
hyperemesis gravidarum.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, Scopus,
Web of Science, Journals@Ovid Fulltext, ClinicalTrials.
gov, and Google Scholar databases.
METHODS
OF
STUDY
SELECTION: Studies
were
included for review if they were written in English,
included
a
comparison
population
of
patients
not
exposed to ondansetron, and reported human data,
original research, exposure to ondansetron during the
first trimester, and structural birth defects as an outcome.
TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: A total
of 423 records were identified. After accounting for
duplicate records and including only relevant articles,
a total of eight records met criteria for review. Data from
the various studies were conflicting: whereas the three
largest studies showed no increased risk of birth defects
as a whole (36 malformations, 1,233 exposed compared
with 141 malformations and 4,932 unexposed; 58/1,248
exposed compared with 31,357/895,770 unexposed; and
38/1,349 exposed compared with 43,620/1,500,085 unex-
posed; with odds ratios [ORs] of 1.12 (95% confidence
interval [CI] 0.69–1.82), 1.3 [95% CI 1.0–1.7], and 0.95
[95% CI 0.72–1.26], respectively), two of these studies
demonstrated a slightly increased risk of cardiac defects
specifically (OR 2.0 [95% CI 1.3–3.1] and 1.62 [95% CI
1.04–2.14]), a finding that was not replicated in other
studies. The most consistent association (if any) appears
to be a small increase in the incidence of cardiac abnor-
malities, the bulk of which are septal defects.
CONCLUSION: The overall risk of birth defects associated
with ondansetron exposure appears to be low. There may
be a small increase in the incidence of cardiac abnormal-
ities in ondansetron-exposed neonates. Therefore, ondan-
setron use for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy should be
reserved for those women whose symptoms have not been
adequately controlled by other methods.

A
s many as 80% of pregnant women will experience
nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.1 In approxi-
mately one third of this population, nausea and vomit-
ing in pregnancy (and in particular, hyperemesis
gravidarum) poses a significant burden in terms of
missed time at work, adverse effects on personal and
family relationships, and increased health care-related
visits.1–4 Additionally, severe nausea and vomiting in
pregnancy (hyperemesis gravidarum) can cause dehy-
dration and weight loss necessitating hospitalization.
A number of medications have been tried for
treating nausea and vomiting in pregnancy with
various degrees of success. There are currently limited
data available to guide clinicians in choosing anti-
emetic medications for treating nausea and vomiting
in pregnancy. However, clinical experience and
a limited number of studies have supported using
medications such as doxylamine, pyridoxine, meto-
clopramide, and ondansetron.5–7 The American Col-
lege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (the College)
currently recommends the combination of pyridoxine
and doxylamine as first-line treatment for nausea and
vomiting
in
pregnancy.

 peripherally at vagal nerve terminals and centrally in
the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema
to reduce nausea, has become one of the most com-
monly prescribed antiemetics for treating nausea and
vomiting in pregnancy in the United States. Various
studies have demonstrated its effectiveness for treating
nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.8–11
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
has classified ondansetron in Pregnancy Category B.
However, a number of concerns have been raised
recently regarding the safety of ondansetron use by
pregnant women.12 Particular worry has focused on
the possible increased risk of birth defects in neonates
born to mothers who used ondansetron during their
pregnancies. A number of web sites have appeared on
the Internet touting risks of birth defects associated
with the use of ondansetron and encouraging parents
of neonates born with birth defects whose mothers
used ondansetron during pregnancy to consider legal
action against the makers of ondansetron. Both pa-
tients and medical providers can be confused by the
barrage of sometimes conflicting information avail-
able online. The following constitutes a systematic
review of the medical literature on the safety of on-
dansetron use during pregnancy, focusing on the
potential risk of congenital malformations in neonates
of women exposed to ondansetron during pregnancy.
SOURCES
Following the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies
in Epidemiology guidelines for systematic reviews,
the author, with the assistance of a professional
medical librarian with expertise in performance of
systematic reviews, carried out a search of the peer-
reviewed
literature
using
PubMed,
EMBASE,
Cochrane, Google Scholar, Journals@Ovid Fulltext,
Scopus, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov. The
search was restricted to human studies in English pub-
lished through November 15, 2015. The search string
used was
ondansetron AND (pregnancy OR birth defects OR con-
genital defects OR congenital malformations)
The author also searched referenced articles
generated by this database search and meeting the
inclusion criteria described subsequently.
STUDY SELECTION
A study was included for review if it 1) was written in
English, 2) reported human data, 3) reported the
results of original research (case reports or series,
editorials, commentaries, review papers, and clinical
guideline documents were excluded), 4) reported on
exposure during pregnancy to ondansetron during
a time period relevant to the development of birth
defects (ie, first trimester; studies that did not include
women exposed during the first trimester were
excluded), 5) reported structural birth defects as an
outcome, and 6) included a comparison population of
patients not exposed to ondansetron.
RESULTS
The search identified a total of 423 records across all
databases. Three hundred fifty records were not
relevant to the search criteria, leaving 73 records.
Sixty-five records were duplicates, leaving a total of
eight studies that met criteria for review (Fig. 1). The
results of the eight studies that met study criteria are
summarized in Table 1.
Einarson et al13 published the first study to exam-
ine the safety of ondansetron use during pregnancy.
The authors followed the outcomes of 176 women in
Canada who took ondansetron during their first tri-
mester and compared them with two other groups of
women who did not take ondansetron during their
pregnancies. They did not find any statistically signif-
icant differences between the groups in terms of num-
ber of stillbirths, number of miscarriages, incidence of
major malformations, gestational age at birth, and
mean birth weights. As a result of the small sample
size, however, the study was powered only to detect
a
fivefold
increase
in
the
incidence
of
major
malformations.
Asker et al14 published an observational cohort
study that obtained data from the Swedish Medical
Birth Registry. Sixty-five women in this cohort were
exposed to ondansetron during the first trimester of
their pregnancies. Those fetuses exposed to ondanse-
tron in utero were not found to have an increased risk
of malformations.

 Colvin et al15 from Australia examined 263 neo-
nates born to 251 women exposed to ondansetron
during pregnancy, 81% of whom were exposed during
their
first
trimester.
There
was
no
significantly
increased risk of any major birth defect with first-
trimester exposure (odds ratio [OR] 1.2, 95% confi-
dence interval [CI] 0.6–2.2). A significantly increased
risk of obstructive renal defects was found (OR 6.2,
95% CI 2.0–19.5) but the number of cases was less
than five, resulting in a wide CI.
A recent study by Van Bennekom et al,16 pub-
lished in abstract form, examined data from two
case-control studies, the Slone Birth Defects Study
and the National Birth Defects Prevention Study. A
total of 354 pregnant women within the two study
groups used ondansetron during their pregnancies.
The National Birth Defects Prevention Study group
(n5111) had no significantly increased risk of giving
birth to a neonate with cleft palate (OR 1.5, 95% CI
0.9–2.5), whereas the Birth Defects Study group
(n5243) had a significantly decreased risk of a neonate
with cleft palate (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2–0.8). The only
other statistically significant finding was a modestly
increased risk of renal agenesis or dysplasia in the
larger group (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.3–4.0).
Several more recent studies examining the risk
of ondansetron use during pregnancy have been
published utilizing larger cohorts of patients. In
2012, Anderka et al17 published an analysis of data
from the U.S. National Birth Defects Prevention
Study. The authors examined a total of 4,524 cases
and 5,859 controls; they specifically looked at the
incidence of four types of birth defects: cleft lip with
and without cleft palate, cleft palate alone, hypospa-
dias, and neural tube defects. In this study, there was
not found to be an increased risk of cleft lip, neural
tube defects, or hypospadias. However, the authors
reported a roughly twofold increased risk of cleft
palate in ondansetron-exposed neonates (OR 2.37,
95% CI 1.18–4.76). There were 11 cleft palate cases
in neonates exposed to ondansetron and 514 cases in
unexposed neonates. The relatively small sample size
in this study limits the interpretability of these re-
sults, and no other studies thus far have demon-
strated the increased risk for cleft palate reported in
this study.

 In 2013, Pasternak et al18 published the results of
a cohort study of 608,385 pregnancies in Denmark
utilizing data from the National Patient Register and
Medical Birth Registry spanning the years 2004-2011.
The authors studied women with first-trimester expo-
sure to ondansetron (up to and including week 12)
and examined the incidence of major birth defects
as defined by the European Concerted Action on
Congenital Anomalies and Twins. They excluded
chromosomal aberrations such as trisomy 21 (Down
syndrome) and other known causes of birth defects
such as fetal alcohol syndrome. Each woman exposed
to ondansetron was matched to unexposed women in
a one-to-four ratio, and the authors used logistic
regression to estimate propensity scores as the proba-
bility of exposure to ondansetron. The models were
adjusted for various factors including hospitalization
for hyperemesis gravidarum or nausea and vomiting
as a proxy measure of severity and exposure to other
antiemetic medications during pregnancy. The au-
thors did not find any significant association between
exposure to ondansetron and incidence of major birth
defects (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.69–1.82), small for gesta-
tional age (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.89–1.44), low birth
weight (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.51–1.13), or preterm
delivery (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66–1.25).
Andersen et al19 published a study in abstract
form in 2013. Data were obtained from the same data-
base as the Pasternak study but examined the years
1997–2010. The authors examined a total of 897,018
births; of these, 1,248 women obtained a prescription
for ondansetron. Fifty-eight congenital malformations
(4.7%) were noted in the ondansetron-exposed group,
and 31,357 malformations (3.5%) were noted in the
control group. Exposure to ondansetron was associ-
ated with an OR of 1.3 (95% CI 1.0–1.7) for major
malformations. An increased prevalence of heart de-
fects (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.3–3.1) accounted for the bulk
of the increased malformations found. The data from
this study have thus far been published only in
abstract form, making it difficult to determine specific
study methods, unlike other studies of similar size
(such as Pasternak et al). Additionally, the CI for risk
of major malformations includes 1, which amounts to
a negative result.
In 2014, another cohort study was published by
Danielsson et al20 that evaluated approximately 1.5 mil-
lion births and examined 1,349 neonates exposed to

 ondansetron in utero. No significantly increased risk
was found for either total malformations (OR 0.95,
95% CI 0.72–1.26) or “relatively severe” malformations
(OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.81–1.53). However, when the au-
thors looked specifically at cardiac malformations, they
found a slightly increased risk compared with meclizine
(OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.04–2.14). The majority of cardiac
defects reported in this study were septal defects (17 of
19 total; OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.19–3.28).
DISCUSSION
Data from the currently available studies on the risk of
birth defects from ondansetron use are inconsistent and
sometimes conflicting. The majority of the published
safety studies on ondansetron exposure in early
pregnancy indicates that the risk of birth defects
resulting from use of ondansetron is small. The results
of one study suggested a slightly increased risk of cleft
palate,17 but this risk has not been duplicated in sub-
sequent
studies
and
another
small
study
found
a decreased risk for cleft palate.16 Two other studies
suggested a small increase in risk of cardiac defects,19,20
whereas another very large, methodologically sound
study failed to demonstrate an increased risk of any
of the adverse outcomes listed previously.18
Before FDA approval of ondansetron, a number of
studies were performed as part of a preclinical safety
evaluation of the drug. Researchers performed single-
and repeat-dose in vitro and animal experiments to
examine ondansetron’s potential for reproductive tox-
icity, oncogenicity, genotoxicity, hypersensitivity, and
local irritancy. In these studies, ondansetron was noted
to have a very good safety profile; the only significant
toxicity noted was central nervous system toxicity that
occurred only when near lethal doses were adminis-
tered to the animals. Ondansetron did not demonstrate
oncogenic or genotoxic potential and was not found to
show reproductive toxicity.21
Studies examining efficacy of ondansetron use
in nausea and vomiting in pregnancy demonstrate
that it is at least as effective as other commonly
used antiemetics (including metoclopramide and
promethazine)4,22,23 and, in the case of pyridoxine
and doxylamine, that it may be more effective.11 It
also appears to be highly efficacious in the treat-
ment of hyperemesis gravidarum and may have
a lower incidence of side effects than other antie-
metics
used
in
the
treatment
of
hyperemesis
gravidarum.10,24
Although the safety studies published to date
present sometimes conflicting results, it appears that
ondansetron using during pregnancy is generally safe
and is very effective for treating nausea and vomiting
in pregnancy. Some data suggest a mildly increased
risk of cardiac septal defects, although this associa-
tion is not consistent across studies. Given ondanse-
tron’s demonstrated efficacy in treatment of nausea
and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravi-
darum, its use should not be completely discounted,
particularly in cases in which other medications have
failed. To minimize potential risk, ondansetron
should not be utilized as a first-line medication for
treating nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. The
combination of doxylamine and pyridoxine (the cur-
rent first-line recommendation by the College for
treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy) or
nonpharmacologic methods (such as ginger) should
be used for initial treatment. Other antiemetics that
are generally recognized as safe in pregnancy such as
metoclopramide and promethazine can be consid-
ered.
Additionally,
ondansetron
use
should
be
avoided, if possible, during the early stages of preg-
nancy
(ie,
before
10
weeks
of
gestation)
to
further minimize any possible risk of teratogenicity
(however small), because the fetal cardiovascular sys-
tem forms very early in pregnancy (during the first
10 weeks).25
Ondansetron has previously been designated
FDA Pregnancy Category B.26 The most recent Col-
lege Practice Bulletin on Nausea and Vomiting of
Pregnancy, published in September 2015, continues
to list ondansetron as an effective treatment for nau-
sea and vomiting of pregnancy and states that “the
absolute risk to any fetus [from ondansetron] is
low.”27 It also recommends that “early treatment
of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is recommen-
ded to prevent progression to hyperemesis gravida-
rum.” The risk of birth defects resulting from first-
trimester exposure to ondansetron is not clear but
appears to be very low. Because of this potential
risk, it should not be utilized as a first-line agent
for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in preg-
nancy. First-line agents such as ginger or pyridoxine
and doxylamine are not always effective for treating
nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, and the known
risks associated with suboptimally treated nausea
and vomiting in pregnancy or hyperemesis gravida-
rum need to be weighed against the very small
potential risks associated with ondansetron use. If
first-line agents for the treatment of nausea and
vomiting in pregnancy are not felt to control a pa-
tient’s symptoms adequately, particularly after the
first 10 weeks, health care providers and patients
should be reassured that ondansetron use during
pregnancy is generally safe and is a highly effective
measure for control of nausea and vomiting in
