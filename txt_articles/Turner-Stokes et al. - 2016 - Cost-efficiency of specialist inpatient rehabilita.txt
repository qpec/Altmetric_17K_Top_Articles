ABSTRACT
Objectives: To evaluate functional outcomes, care
needs and cost-efficiency of specialist rehabilitation for
a multicentre cohort of inpatients with complex
neurological disability, comparing different diagnostic
groups across 3 levels of dependency.
Design: A multicentre cohort analysis of prospectively
collected clinical data from the UK Rehabilitation
Outcomes Collaborative (UKROC) national clinical
database, 2010–2015.
Setting: All 62 specialist (levels 1 and 2) rehabilitation
services in England.
Participants: Working-aged adults (16–65 years) with
complex neurological disability. Inclusion criteria: all
episodes with length of stay (LOS) 8–400 days and
complete outcome measures recorded on admission
and discharge. Total N=5739: acquired brain injury
n=4182 (73%); spinal cord injury n=506 (9%);
peripheral neurological conditions n=282 (5%);
progressive conditions n=769 (13%).
Intervention: Specialist inpatient multidisciplinary
rehabilitation.
Outcome measures: Dependency and care costs:
Northwick Park Dependency Scale/Care Needs
Assessment (NPDS/NPCNA). Functional independence:
UK Functional Assessment Measure (UK Functional
Independence Measure (FIM)+FAM). Cost-efficiency:
(1) time taken to offset rehabilitation costs by savings
in NPCNA-estimated costs of ongoing care, (2) FIM
efficiency (FIM gain/LOS days), (3) FIM+FAM efficiency
(FIM+FAM gain/LOS days). Patients were analysed in 3
groups of dependency.
Results: Mean LOS 90.1 (SD 66) days. All groups
showed significant reduction in dependency between
admission and discharge on all measures (paired t
tests: p<0.001). Mean reduction in ‘weekly care costs’
was greatest in the high-dependency group at £760/
week (95% CI 726 to 794)), compared with the
medium-dependency (£408/week (95% CI 370 to
445)), and low-dependency (£130/week (95% CI 82 to
178)), groups. Despite longer LOS, time taken to offset
the cost of rehabilitation was 14.2 (95% CI 9.9 to
18.8) months in the high-dependency group,
compared with 22.3 (95% CI 16.9 to 29.2) months
(medium dependency), and 27.7 (95% CI 15.9 to
39.7) months (low dependency). FIM efficiency
appeared greatest in medium-dependency patients
(0.54), compared with the low-dependency (0.37) and
high-dependency (0.38) groups. Broadly similar
patterns were seen across all 4 diagnostic groups.
Conclusions: Specialist rehabilitation can be highly
cost-efficient for all neurological conditions, producing
substantial savings in ongoing care costs, especially in
high-dependency patients.
INTRODUCTION
Over 1 million people in the UK (2% of the
population) have a disabling neurological
condition, of which 350 000 require help for
most of their daily activities and it is esti-
mated that 850 000 people care for someone
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ A large 5-year national consecutive cohort ana-
lysis representing all specialist (levels 1 and 2)
rehabilitation units in England.
▪ Prospective routinely collected data are reflective
of real clinical practice.
▪ Different
methods
for
evaluation
of
cost-
efficiency are compared in the same data set.
▪ Owing to evolution of reporting requirements
over the data collection period, the outcomes of
interest were collected in less than 50% of the
full rehabilitation data set, so selection bias
cannot be excluded.
▪ This highly selected group of patients with
complex needs is atypical in comparison to
populations
described
in
published
analyses
from other large data sets, but has potential rele-
vance for other health systems that provide ter-
tiary specialist rehabilitation services.

 with a neurological condition.1 By improving independ-
ence and autonomy, rehabilitation has the potential to
reduce the needs for care and thus relieve the burden
and costs of care, both for family and society. Although
there is a growing body of trial-based evidence for the
effectiveness of rehabilitation in a variety of neurological
conditions,2 3 there are other important questions that
require a practice-based approach to determine what
works best for which patients and what approaches rep-
resent value for money in the context of real-life clinical
practice.4 5
Much of the evidence for effectiveness of rehabilitation
comes from the arenas of stroke and care of older
people. To date, there has been relatively little focus on
younger (ie, working aged) adults with complex disability
following neurological illness or injury. Specialist rehabili-
tation is increasingly recognised as an essential compo-
nent of healthcare for this group of patients.6 However, it
can be a costly intervention and systematic evaluation is
required to demonstrate that programmes are both
effective and cost-efficient. Porter and Teisberg7 intro-
duced the concept of ‘value-based healthcare’, where the
goal is not necessarily to minimise costs but to maximise
‘value’, defined as ‘patient outcomes divided by costs’.
The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) is the
most widely used standardised outcome measure for
rehabilitation in the world. Established large rehabilita-
tion data sets in the USA and Australia rely on the FIM,
not only as a measure of functional gains during
rehabilitation, but as a casemix tool and a measure of
cost-efficiency. In the absence of direct costing data, the
‘FIM-efficiency index’ (FIM gain/length of stay (LOS))
is often used as a proxy for cost-efficiency.8–13 However,
such estimations have a number of weaknesses:
1. They assume linearity of change and equal weighting
of items to the prediction of overall cost of care,
which is not necessarily the case.
2. They are frequently confounded by floor and ceiling
effects.14
3. The FIM is largely focused on physical disability,
which limits its use in the context of complex neuro-
logical disability, where cognitive and psychosocial
problems are often the principal limiting factors.
The UK National Health Service (NHS) provides one
of the most comprehensive health and social service
systems in the world15 and demands a somewhat differ-
ent approach.
▸ Rehabilitation services are planned and provided in
coordinated regional networks over a relatively small
geographical area. Local general (level 3) rehabilita-
tion services provide for the majority of patients, but
a smaller number are referred to specialist (level 1 or
2) services, which take a selected population of
mainly
younger
adults
with
complex
needs
for
rehabilitation that are beyond the scope of their local
rehabilitation services.16
▸ The statutory commitment to life-long provision of
care supports longer periods of rehabilitation in
these specialist services, provided that this can be
demonstrated to produce meaningful cost-benefits
through gains in wider independence and reduction
of long-term care needs.
Since 2010, the national UK Rehabilitation Outcomes
Collaborative (UKROC) database has collated episode
data for all inpatients admitted to specialist rehabilita-
tion services (levels 1 and 2) in England, providing
national benchmarking on quality, outcomes and cost-
efficiency of rehabilitation. Within the UKROC data set,
functional gain is evaluated using the UK Functional
Assessment Measure (UK FIM+FAM),17 18 which extends
the FIM to provide greater coverage of cognitive and psy-
chosocial function. Cost-efficiency is computed in terms
of the length of time taken to offset the initial costs of
rehabilitation through savings in the ongoing costs of
community care as estimated by the Northwick Park
Dependency Care Needs Assessment.19 20
A previously published single-centre analysis using
these
indices
demonstrated
the
cost-efficiency
of
rehabilitation for younger adults with complex needs fol-
lowing acquired brain injury (ABI),21 and showed that
longer lengths of stay can provide value for money by
reducing ongoing care costs.22 The cost-benefits were
particularly marked for highly dependent patients, while
‘FIM efficiency’ appeared to be greatest for the medium-
dependency group. This finding was important as highly
dependent patients may be denied rehabilitation in
other healthcare systems on the basis that they are costly
to care for and not expected to make significant gains
on the FIM.21
The objective of this article is to present the first
national cohort analysis of the UKROC database to
describe functional outcome, change in care needs and
cost-efficiency
following
specialist
rehabilitation
for
working-aged adults with complex disability arising from
neurological conditions. In particular, we wished to
determine whether the single-centre findings above were
reproducible across multiple centres and across a wider
range of neurological conditions.
Specific research questions were:
1. What types of functional gain are made during
rehabilitation by patients with different neurological
conditions?
2. Can longer lengths of stay for highly dependent
patients be justified by savings in ongoing care costs?
3. Are there important differences in outcome and cost-
efficiency across different neurological conditions
and for different levels of patient dependency that
service planners should be aware of?

 neurological disability undergoing specialist inpatient
rehabilitation in England.
Setting and data source
In England, level 1 rehabilitation units are tertiary ser-
vices providing for a regionally based catchment popula-
tion of 3–5million and taking a highly selected caseload
of patients with very complex needs. They are subdivided
by casemix into hyperacute, 1a (physical disability), 1c
(cognitive behavioural) and 1b (mixed) services. Level 2
services take a mixed caseload providing for a more local
population, divided into 2a (supradistrict) and 2b (local
district) specialist rehabilitation services. The data report-
ing requirements have evolved over time and vary some-
what between the different levels of service.
The UKROC database was established in 2009 through
funding a programme grant from the UK National
Institute for Health Research (NIHR),23 but now pro-
vides the national commissioning data set for NHS
England. The database collates de-identified data, which
are uploaded at monthly intervals and stored on a
secured NHS server held at Northwick Park Hospital. It
is overseen by a steering group of the British Society of
Rehabilitation Medicine.
The data set comprises sociodemographic and process
data (waiting times, discharge destination, etc) as well as
clinical information on rehabilitation needs, inputs and
outcomes. Full details may be found on the UKROC
website http://www.csi.kcl.ac.uk/ukroc.html.
▸ Data
collection
started
formally
in
April
2010.
Reporting was initially voluntary and contributing
centres could report any one of three approved
outcome measures, the Barthel Index (BI), the FIM
or UK FIM+FAM.
▸ Since April 2012, levels 1 and 2a services are commis-
sioned centrally by NHS England and are required to
report the full UKROC data set for all admitted epi-
sodes, including the UK FIM+FAM as the principal
outcome measure.
▸ Reporting of the Northwick Park Dependency Scale
and Care Needs Assessment as a measure of cost-
efficiency was optional until April 2013, but is now a
requirement for national benchmarking for these
levels 1 and 2a services.
▸ Locally commissioned level 2b (local district) services
may still report only lower level data such as the BI or
FIM.
Measurements
The UK FIM+FAM is a global measure of disability.17 18 It
includes the 18-item FIM (V.4) and adds a further 12
items, mainly addressing psychosocial function giving a
total of 30 items (16 motor and 14 cognitive items).
Each item is scored on a seven-point ordinal scale from
1 (total dependence) to 7 (complete independence).
Further details are published elsewhere.17 18
The Northwick Park Dependency Score (NPDS) is an
ordinal scale of dependency on nursing staff time
(number of helpers and time taken to assist with each
task) designed to assess needs for care and nursing in
clinical rehabilitation settings.19 It comprises a 16-item
scale of basic care needs (range 0–65) and a 7-item scale
of special nursing needs (range 0–35)—total range 0–
100. It is shown to be a valid and reliable measure of
needs for care and nursing in rehabilitation settings.24 It
supports categorisation of patients into three depend-
ency groups based on their admission NPDS:21
▸ Low dependency (NPDS <10): patients are largely
independent for basic self-care,
▸ Medium (NPDS 10–24): patients generally require
help from one person for most self-care tasks,
▸ High (NPDS ≥25): patients require help from two or
more persons for most care tasks and often also have
special nursing needs.
The NPDS also translates via a computerised algo-
rithm to the Northwick Park Care Needs Assessment
(NPCNA)20 which estimates the total care hours per
week and the approximate weekly cost of care (£/week)
in the community, based on the UK care agency costs.
The NPCNA provides a generic assessment of care
needs, regardless of who provides and pays for them.
The estimated cost of care is therefore independent of
individual circumstances or local policy for the provision
continuing care, which varies widely across the UK. The
algorithm is embedded within the UKROC software and
generates this information automatically.
Although there is no formal accreditation process for
use of the UK FIM+FAM and NPDS, the attendance of
UK FIM+FAM training by at least a core team of staff is
requirement for UKROC registration. All units that are
registered with UKROC have access to the national train-
ing and update workshops, as well as free telephone
support.
Cost-efficiency of rehabilitation
Within the UKROC data set, the cost-efficiency is calcu-
lated as the time taken to offset the cost of rehabilitation
by the resulting savings in the cost of ongoing care in
the community. This is calculated from the ‘episode cost
of rehabilitation’ divided by ‘reduction in weekly cost of
care’ from admission to discharge, as estimated by the
NPCNA. The episode cost was calculated per patient as
‘bed-day cost×LOS’. The cost per bed-day was calculated
on updated data from our previously published cost-
analysis.25 We used mean per diem costs for the differ-
ent levels of service as follows: 1 hyperacute: £670, 1a:
£540, 1b: £483, 1c: £634, 2a: 452, 2b: £418. For compari-
son with other series, we also report FIM efficiency, cal-
culated at individual patient level as change in total FIM
score/LOS in days. FIM+FAM efficiency is calculated as
change in total UK FIM+FAM score/LOS in days.
Valid LOS
In order to identify plausible admissions for rehabilita-
tion (as opposed to brief inpatient assessment or for
long-term care) we selected patients with LOS between 8

 and 400 days. Other cohort studies have used similar
cut-off points,26 although the exact time frames may vary
according
with
local
practice.
In
this
cohort,
we
excluded patients staying for 1 week or less as they
would not meet even the lowest time-thresholds for
repeat assessment. The NHS England service specifica-
tion for rehabilitation stipulates a maximum programme
length of 180 days with a trim point of 14 days (ie,
194 days in total). Subject to approval, extension for a
second period may be granted in some cases if it can be
justified on the grounds of anticipated functional gain
and cost-efficiency, bringing the total allowed LOS to
388 days. Allowing for possible short delays in discharge
at the end of programme, we therefore set 400 days as
the ceiling for a plausible LOS for rehabilitation.
Data extraction
De-identified
data
were
extracted
for
all
recorded
inpatient episodes for adults aged 16–65 years admitted
to level 1 or 2 specialist rehabilitation service and dis-
charged during the 5-year period between 1.4.2010 and
31.3.15, if they had:
A. A neurological condition recorded in the diagnostic
category;
B. A LOS 8–400 days;
C. Valid UK FIM+FAM and NPDS ratings completed
both within 10 days of admission and within the last
week before discharge.
Data were collated in MS Excel and transferred to
SPSS V.22 for analysis.
Data handling and analysis
Because data reporting was initially voluntary, missing
data were expected. No data were imputed for missing
values. There is continued debate about whether to use
parametric or non-parametric statistics for this type of
data. In this analysis, given the large size of the data set
and long ordinal nature of the measures (ie, many pos-
sible data points), we have elected to describe and
analyse the data using parametric statistics—although
non-parametric analysis gave very similar results and is
available from the authors if required.
▸ Ninety-five per cent CIs were calculated and multiple
comparisons made using bootstrapping with samples
of n=1000, to minimise the effect of any skewed data.
▸ Paired t tests were used to compare significant differ-
ences between admission and discharge.
▸ One-way analyses of variances (ANOVAs) with boot-
strapped post hoc analysis and Bonferroni correction
to correct for multiple tests were used to compare dif-
ferences for diagnostic groups and for different levels
of dependency. Key results from post hoc analyses are
summarised in the text, but not given in tables.
Further details are available on request from the cor-
responding author.
In this non-interventional observational study, size was
not predetermined but dictated by the accruals to the
national data set over the 5-year period that met the
inclusion criteria. Because the data set was dominated
by patients with ABI, analysis was also undertaken separ-
ately for each diagnostic group.
RESULTS
Figure 1 illustrates the data extraction process. From a
total of 13 004 registered episodes for adults aged 16–65
with
a
neurological
condition,
12 256
had
a
LOS
between 8 and 400 days representing the data set of
adults admitted for rehabilitation. Of these, 5739 (47%)
had a valid NPDS and FIM+FAM on both admission and
discharge and were included in the analysed sample.
A total of 62 rehabilitation units (15 level 1, 15 level
2a and 32 level 2b services) provided data, with good
representation across all four health regions in England.
Demographics are given in table 1. Because the
sample comprised less than 50% of the total rehabilita-
tion data set, demographics were compared for the ana-
lysed and the total sample. No significant differences
were found.
The study sample comprised approximately 3:2 males:
females, with a mean age at admission of 47.3 (SD=12.6)

BMJ Open: first published as 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010238 on 24 February 2016. Downloaded from 
 years. The mean rehabilitation LOS was 90.1 (SD=65.5)
days. Nearly three-quarters of the sample (73%) had
ABI, the remainder having spinal cord injuries (SCIs;
9%), peripheral neurological conditions, for example,
Guillain-Barré syndrome (5%) and progressive condi-
tions (13%). Table 1 shows the demographics for these
diagnostic groups and shows the breakdown of aetio-
logical causes within each category. As the time between
onset and admission (‘time since onset’) was very highly
skewed, the median and IQR is given as well as the
mean (SD). Excluding the progressive conditions, the
mean time since onset for ABI, SCI and peripheral
neurological conditions was 9.0 months (SD 46.5).
One-way ANOVA tests confirmed significant differ-
ences in LOS and episode costs (p<0.001) between the
different diagnostic groups. Patients with ABI stayed
longest (mean 90 days) with the highest episode costs
(mean approximately £43 000), while those with progres-
sive conditions stayed the shortest (mean 56 days) and
corresponding lower episode costs (mean approximately
£25 000).
Dependency and functional outcomes
Table 2 summarises the overall dependency and func-
tional outcome scores for the sample, together with cost-
efficiency. Between admission and discharge there was
highly significant increase in all parameters of functional
independence (FIM+FAM; p<0.001), with corresponding
reduction in all parameters of dependency (NPDS/
NPCNA; p<0.001). The mean total FIM+FAM gain was
35.5 and the mean individually calculated FIM+FAM effi-
ciency/week was 0.67 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.69). The mean
total cost of the rehabilitation programme was £39 381
and mean savings in ongoing cost of care in the commu-
nity was £496/week. The mean time taken to offset the
initial costs of rehabilitation was 17.9 months (95% CI
14.5 to 21.4).
Differences between diagnostic groups
The UKROC software generates ‘FAM splats’ in the form
of radar charts which provide an ‘at a glance’ view of the
disability profile and patterns of change during rehabili-
tation for the 30 FIM+FAM items. Figure 2 shows the
composite FAM splats based on median item scores at
admission and discharge for the four main diagnostic
groups. They illustrate the clinical value of recording
change in psychosocial, as well as physical function,
which would not be detected by changes in the FIM
items alone.
The differences in functional outcome across the diag-
nostic groups are summarised in table 3. On admission,
FIM+FAM motor scores were broadly similar across all

 the categories with the difference only crossing the
threshold for significance between the ABI and SCI
groups. However, as may be expected, cognitive FIM
+FAM scores were significantly lower in ABI than all
other diagnosis (p<0.001), and remained so at discharge
despite the substantially greater change in this group
(mean 15.7). Cognitive FIM+FAM scores were also sig-
nificantly lower for progressive conditions than for the
SCI and peripheral neurology groups, but the latter
were similar.
Between admission and discharge, change in FIM
+FAM motor score was significantly different between all
groups (p<0.001), except between ABI and SCI (p=1.0).
Change in FIM+FAM cognitive score was significantly dif-
ferent between all of the groups (p<0.01) except for SCI
and progressive conditions (p=1.0). Mean FIM+FAM effi-
ciency was lowest in progressive conditions (mean 0.44)
followed by the SCI group (mean 0.59) while broadly
similar in the ABI and peripheral neurology groups at a
mean of 0.71 and 0.77, respectively.
The differences in dependency are also summarised
in table 3. In keeping with the above findings, the ABI
group was the most dependent on admission. Post hoc
tests showed NPDS and estimated weekly care costs to be
significantly
higher
in
ABI
than
all
other
groups
(p<0.001), but there were no statistically significant dif-
ferences between any of the other groups.
Between
admission
and
discharge,
reduction
in
dependency and care costs were significantly different
between all groups (p<0.001), except between ABI and
SCI (p≥0.1). The mean individually calculated time to
offset the cost of rehabilitation was lowest in the progres-
sive conditions, at 8.5 months compared with 19–20 for
the other groups, but the data were widely spread with
overlapping CIs and post hoc tests did not show any sig-
nificant between-group differences.

The radar chart (or ‘FAM splat’) provides a graphic representation of the disability profile from the FIM+FAM data. The
30-scale items are arranged as spokes of a wheel. Scoring levels from 1 (total dependence) to 7 (total independence) run from
the centre outwards. Thus, a perfect score would be demonstrated as a large circle. This composite radar chart illustrates the
median scores on admission and discharge. The yellow-shaded portion represents the median scores on admission for each
item. The blue-shaded area represents the change in median score from admission to discharge. Clear differences in the pattern
of disability can be seen between the four groups. FIM, Functional Independence Measure; FIM+FAM, UK Functional

 Differences between groups based on dependency at
admission
The change in dependency, care needs and cost of care
in the community are summarised in table 4, grouped
by the level of dependency on admission.
As anticipated, LOS and the total cost of the rehabili-
tation episode were greatest in the high-dependency
group and smallest in the low-dependency group with
some twofold difference between them, and post hoc
tests showed significant differences seen between all
three groups (p<0.001).
The ongoing care hours and costs of care in the com-
munity remained high at discharge in the same pattern
as on admission, but the reduction in care hours and
costs was greater in the higher dependency groups,
reflecting the higher starting levels—again with signifi-
cant
differences
between
all
dependency
groups
(p<0.001).
Despite the higher cost of the rehabilitation, the time
to offset the costs of treatment through savings in the
cost of ongoing community care was shortest in the
high-dependency group at 14.2 months, followed by the
medium-dependency group at 22.3 months, and longest
in the low-dependency group 27.7 months. But, despite
the nearly twofold difference between the means for the
low-dependency and high-dependency groups, the CIs
were wide and the between-group ANOVA only just
reached significance at p=0.024.
By contrast, FIM efficiency was highest in the medium-
dependency group at 0.54 but similar between the low-
dependency and high-dependency groups at 0.37 and
0.38, respectively (p=0.15). FIM+FAM efficiency was
also highest in the medium-dependency group at 0.83,
and again similar in the low-dependency and high-
dependency
groups
at
0.70
and
0.58,
respectively
(p=0.65).
Because the data set was dominated by the ABI group,
we also compared the main cost-efficiency parameters
between dependency groups separately for each of the
diagnostic groups—see table 5. A broadly similar pattern
was seen in all the groups, with the time to offset the
costs
of
rehabilitation
being
shortest
in
the
high-
dependency group (albeit with wide CIs), while FIM effi-
ciency tended to be highest in the medium-dependency
group—reaching significance in all diagnostic groups
except the peripheral neurological conditions.
DISCUSSION
Large cohort analyses of routinely collected outcome
data make an important contribution to our understand-
ing of the gains that can be made from rehabilitation in
the course of real-life clinical practice, and provide the
opportunity for comparing different populations and
practices. This first multicentre analysis of the UK
national clinical data set for specialist rehabilitation
demonstrates that patients with complex neurological
disability have the potential to gain from specialist
rehabilitation across a wide range of conditions. It con-
firmed that the findings from the previous single-centre
study of ABI patients21 were generalisable across mul-
tiple centres and a wider range of neurological condi-
tions. Although the costs of treatment were quite high
(£40 000 on average), this investment was offset by
savings in the cost of ongoing care with approximately
18 months.
It should be noted that ‘specialist rehabilitation’
means something rather different in the UK from other
countries.
In
the
USA
and
Australia,
a
‘specialist
rehabilitation centre’ would be one in which the central
focus of treatment is rehabilitation, often in diagnosis-
specific programmes (eg, head injury, stroke or spinal
cord rehabilitation). In the UK, the term ‘specialist
rehabilitation’ is reserved for tertiary (levels 1 and 2)
centres, serving a large catchment population (typically
1–5 million for level 1 units) and admitting a selected
population of patients with highly complex rehabilita-
tion needs, regardless of diagnosis.16 Thus, a stroke unit
that provides rehabilitation as part of a specialist stroke
programme
would
be
classed
as
a
level
3
(non-
specialised) rehabilitation service. Patients who would
progress satisfactorily within their local (level 3) rehabili-
tation services were not included in this analysis, which
therefore
represents
a
smaller
subgroup
of
more
complex
patients,
in
comparison
with
other
inter-
national rehabilitation cohorts. Our findings may never-
theless have relevance for other health systems that offer
tertiary programmes of care.
The time since onset was highly skewed but, on
average, very long (eg, 9 months in the ABI group) com-
pared with other published series.27 Lengths of stay were
also substantially longer compared with recently pub-
lished series from the USA11–13 and Australia,26 so that
FIM efficiency was comparatively lower (0.4 compared
with 0.4–0.8 in the Australian series and 1.9–2.2 in the
US series). These findings reflect the selected group of
patients with complex needs admitted to the levels 1
and 2 services, many of whom had already failed to pro-
gress in their local level 3 rehabilitation services. Direct
comparison of casemix-adjusted outcomes between the
UK and Australian data sets28 confirms the preponder-
ance of very severely disabled patients in the UK series,
especially in the level 1 services. The majority of units
contributing to the US and Australian data sets would be
more similar to levels 2b and 3 services in the UK
(Eagar K, personal communication, 2015).
Nevertheless, for a UK population with mean age
47 years in 2015, the average projected life expectancy
would be approximately 40 years (males) and 42 years
(females).29 Even if one allows an estimated 15-year
reduction in respect of complex neurological disability,
the mean life expectancy of this study group may be
25 years or more. Extrapolated over this period, the
mean saving of nearly £500 per week (or £26 K per
year) in ongoing costs of care might be expected to
lead to overall life-time economic gains in excess of

 £650 000 or more per patient, or £3.7 billon for the
whole study sample. This confirms the value of invest-
ing in appropriate specialist rehabilitation services for
this group of patients. It does of course assume that
the gains in independence are maintained. Evidence
from
a
multicentre
evaluation
of
community-based
follow-up reported stability of dependency (and in
some cases, further improvement) over the first year
following discharge from the nine specialist levels 1 and
2a rehabilitation services in London,30 suggesting that
this assumption is valid—and possibly even conservative
—on a population basis.
Our analysis also demonstrated that cost-efficiency
measured in this way was highest in the most dependent
group of patients. This not only confirms the results
from our previous single-centre study in patients with
ABI,21 but also demonstrates that the reproducibility of
this finding across multiple centres and different neuro-
logical conditions. FIM efficiency, meanwhile, appeared
to be greatest in the medium-dependency group. This
once again underlines the floor and ceiling effects the
FIM in this more complex patient group and the fact
that a linear trajectory of recovery cannot be assumed,
nor an equal weight of items for estimating the cost of
care needs.
These findings are important because, in many coun-
tries, these highly dependent patients may be denied
rehabilitation if they are not expected to make signifi-
cant gains on a FIM score. Thus, they emphasise the
need for a range of different measures, reflecting differ-
ent patient groups and their potential for change in
during rehabilitation. FIM+FAM efficiency showed a
similar pattern to FIM efficiency, so the additional 12
items did not necessarily improve its performance as a
proxy for cost-efficiency, but they did provide a more
holistic evaluation of the change in cognitive/psycho-
social function, in addition to motor function, as illu-
strated in figure 2.
The authors recognise the following limitations to this
study:
▸ The data were collected in the course of routine clin-
ical practice. Despite the training provided to all
units registered with UKROC, the exact level of
expertise of clinicians recording the tools in each of
the 62 centres is unknown. Nevertheless, the data set
is reflective of real-life clinical practice, where staff
experience is expected to vary.
▸ Because of the evolution of reporting requirements
over the data collection period, the analysed sample
represents less than 50% of the full rehabilitation
data set. This finding was expected and comparison
of demographic and baseline data suggested that the
analysed sample was reasonably representative of the
total population. Nevertheless, the possibility of selec-
tion bias cannot be excluded.
▸ The NPCNA estimates of continuing care costs are
not true assessments as applied in traditional health
economic studies. On the other hand, the instrument
has been in use for over 15 years and is now quite
widely taken up both in clinical practice and in
research24 Experience has demonstrated it to be
neither overly generous nor mean in its estimation of
care needs and costs. Moreover, for the purpose of
this study, we were more interested in the relative
values for between-group comparison than the abso-
lute values. Nevertheless, the estimations of cost-
savings should be interpreted with some caution.
▸ Finally, while rehabilitation is provided through the
health sector, the saving in care costs accrues to those
responsible for ongoing care (typically the social care
services or the patient and their family). Thus, the
actual opportunity for realisation and reinvestment of
the savings will depend on the local funding arrange-
ments for health and social care.
The above limitations accepted, findings from this
study add to the growing body of evidence for the cost-
effectiveness of rehabilitation for patients with complex
disabilities.31 32 They confirm the potential for substantial
cost-savings to be made from appropriate provision of
specialist rehabilitation services for patients with complex
needs, even many months after the original injury.
