Abstract
Background: Evidence of protection from childhood Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)
against tuberculosis (TB) in adulthood, when most transmission occurs, is important for
TB control and resource allocation.
Methods: We conducted a population-based case–control study of protection by BCG
given to children aged 12–13 years against tuberculosis occurring 10–29 years later. We
recruited UK-born White subjects with tuberculosis and randomly sampled White com-
munity controls. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using
case–cohort Cox regression, adjusting for potential confounding factors, including socio-
economic status, smoking, drug use, prison and homelessness. Vaccine effectiveness
(VE ¼ 1 – hazard ratio) was assessed at successive intervals more than 10 years following
vaccination.
Results: We obtained 677 cases and 1170 controls after a 65% response rate in both
groups.
Confounding

factors
was
slight
10–20 years after vaccination, and more evident after 20 years. VE 10–15 years after vac-
cination was 51% (95% CI 21, 69%) and 57% (CI 33, 72%) at 15–20 years. Subsequently,
BCG protection appeared to wane; 20–25 years VE ¼ 25% (CI –14%, 51%) and 25–29 years

 VE ¼ 1% (CI –84%, 47%). Based on multiple imputation of missing data (in 17% subjects),
VE estimated in the same intervals after vaccination were similar [56% (CI 33, 72%), 57%
(CI 36, 71%), 25% (–10, 48%), 21% (–39, 55%)].
Conclusions: School-aged BCG vaccination offered moderate protection against tubercu-
losis for at least 20 years, which is longer than previously thought. This has implications
for assessing the cost-effectiveness of BCG vaccination and when evaluating new TB
vaccines.

Background
Tuberculosis (TB) is a major, and potentially preventable,
cause of morbidity and mortality globally, with 2 to 3
billion
of
the
world’s
population
infected
with
Mycobacterium tuberculosis,1 10% of whom progress to
clinical disease.2 In 2015, 10.4 million people were esti-
mated to have developed TB.1 TB incidence increases
sharply in young adults3 and most cases of pulmonary dis-
ease, the main source of onward transmission, occur in
adults. Progress in developing new TB vaccines is slow and
Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is the only licensed TB
vaccine.4 The efficacy of BCG in preventing TB varies geo-
graphically, particularly for pulmonary TB, with limited
evidence of protection in many tropical areas.5,6 Recent
evidence suggest that BCG may act in part by protecting
against infection.7 A large UK trial in the 1950s showed
good protection against TB for up to 15 years following
BCG vaccination of secondary-school children,8 confirmed
in observational studies to last at least 10 years after intro-
duction into the UK national programme.9 Although there
are few data on protection, more than 10 years after vac-
cination,10,11 studies in Brazil,12 in US Native-American
populations13 and, more recently, in the Norwegian gen-
eral population14 suggest BCG protection against TB can
last longer. We aimed to provide confirmatory evidence of
its durability in a case–control study of school-aged BCG
vaccination more than 10 years after vaccination in
England. From the 1950s, BCG (based on the Danish
strain)15,16 was offered routinely to schoolchildren in the
UK aged about 13 years, until the programme was discon-
tinued in 2005.
Methods
From 2102 to 2014, cases and controls were invited to
take part in face-to-face interviews and to be examined for
a BCG scar. We assessed protection from BCG vaccination
administered to children 10–30 years previously, 5-year
intervals after vaccination and tested for trends over time
by analysing time since vaccination on a continuous scale.
Details of the study design are presented elsewhere.17 In
summary, the study was restricted to persons of White eth-
nic group born in the UK. Other ethnic groups with a
higher risk of TB were offered BCG in infancy. Cases were
subjects living in England at diagnosis of a first TB episode
notified
between
2003
and
2012
to
the
Enhanced
Tuberculosis Surveillance System (ETS) of Public Health
England (PHE). Cases not known to be infected with HIV
were included if they were between 23 and 38 years old at
diagnosis (i.e. born between 1965 and 1989, and aged
13 years between 1978 and 2002). Controls were UK-born
subjects of White ethnic group without a previous history
of tuberculosis, residing in England, selected from the gen-
eral population and frequency-matched to cases by birth
Key Messages
• It is unclear whether protection by school-aged Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination against TB continues into
adulthood, when most transmission occurs.
• Using a case–control study design based on 677 cases and 1170 controls, we found about 50% protection that lasted
20 years and then waned.
• That BCG attributable protection against tuberculosis lasts longer than previously thought affects its cost-effective-
ness and has implications for the evaluation of new TB vaccines.

 cohort (in 5-year bands). For logistic efficiency, recruit-
ment of population-based controls was based on three-
stage, self-weighted, cluster sampling across England.17
Experienced field interviewers carried out Computer-
assisted Personal Interviews (CAPIs), following training
specific to the study including inspecting both arms of all
subjects to identify BCG vaccination scars. The training
included scar reading of volunteers with and without scars
and examination of photographs. Formal supervisory field
visits and blind telephone recall interviews of at least 10%
of study participants (selected at random) were conducted
for quality control.
No central databases of school vaccination records exist
in the UK and records were not kept consistently in local
child-health information systems. The classification of
BCG vaccination status was based on a combination of
participants self-reported history of BCG status (convinc-
ing history, probable history, no history) and scar inspec-
tion (present, not present, not examined). As BCG was a
vaccine given in school at about 12–13 years and usually
caused a pustule and then a scar, recall by cases and con-
trols was considered likely to be good. However, several
had difficulties recalling whether or not they had had a tu-
berculin skin test (TST) (children were only eligible for
BCG vaccination if they were considered TST-negative).
These subjects were not excluded from the analysis.
Instead, we reviewed the impact of the likely proportion of
unvaccinated participants who would have had a positive
TST.
Information on potential confounding factors, including
demographic and social variables, was collected and com-
pared in cases and controls. A measure of deprivation at the
small area level (average 1500 households) was obtained
from Census data based on quintiles of the index of mul-
tiple deprivation (IMD) score in 2010.18 Education was as-
sessed as highest education attainment and household
crowding was calculated from current number of people in
the household, number of rooms and bedrooms. Ever or
never been in prison in the UK or elsewhere was noted, as
was a history of being homeless for a week or more, and
regular travel (defined as every few years or more often)
and long stays (3 months or more) in high-TB-burden re-
gions. Smoking was categorized as never, ex- or current,
under or over 20 pack-years. Alcohol consumption was
based on frequency as well as quantity of UK standard units
and recreational drug use as only non-Class A drugs (e.g.
cannabis or solvents) or also using class A drugs (e.g. co-
caine and heroin). Information on smoking, alcohol, drug
use,
prison and homelessness
was
collected
using a
Computer-Assisted
self-interview
(CASI):
interviewees
entered the data on a laptop and then locked them to be in-
accessible to the interviewer before returning the laptop.
Ethics and consent
The study was approved by the UK’s NHS National
Research Ethics Service Committee. We obtained signed
informed
consent
from
those
willing
to
take
part.
Participants, irrespective of whether they completed the
study or not, were given a £15 gift voucher as compensa-
tion for their time.
Statistical methods
Cases and controls were compared across quintiles of the
IMD score. We cross-tabulated history of BCG receipt and
presence and absence of a BCG scar, assessing agreement
using Cohen’s kappa coefficient.
Hazard ratios (HRs) for the association between BCG
vaccination status and TB incidence were estimated using
the case–cohort approach, with controls forming the sub-
cohort.19,20 Controls were considered representative sam-
ples from the underlying population, as they were sampled
at random from the underlying population within which
cases arose (frequency-matched by birth cohort in 5-year
bands). TB rates are very low in the underlying population.
The above approach allowed efficient use of data on the
controls at different ages over time, as well as flexible mod-
elling of VE by time since vaccination.21 VE was defined as
VE ¼ 1 – HR.
Based on a Cox regression model allowing a time-
varying association between vaccination status and case–
control status, each case was compared at its event time
with all controls in the sub-cohort who were still at risk at
that time (i.e. were interviewed at an age older than that of
the case) and in the same year of birth stratum as the case.
The time scale in these analyses was age, and vaccination
status was a time-dependent variable. Self-reported age at
vaccination, if available, was used to define vaccination
status at a given age, otherwise the median age of 12 years
in those reporting age at vaccination was assumed. The
event time for cases was age at TB diagnosis, and the time
of right censoring in controls was the age at interview for
the study. Event times among cases were left-truncated on
the day before the TB diagnosis date. Model parameters
were estimated using a pseudo-partial likelihood analysis
with robust standard errors as is required in a case–cohort
analysis in which control groups are shared between
cases.19,20
HRs
were
estimated

successive
time-since-
vaccination intervals, respectively 10–15, 15–20, 20–25
and 25–30 years after vaccination. Log HRs were also
modelled as a smooth function of time since vaccination.
Flexible models based on restricted cubic splines were com-
pared, using the Akaike information criterion (AIC),22
with a model in which the log HR for BCG vaccination

 was
assumed
to

vaccination.
All Cox models used separate baseline hazards by year
of birth, to take into account the frequency-matching of
controls by birth cohort. The baseline model was also ad-
justed for sex. Deprivation level and educational level were
considered to be potentially important confounders and
were added to the baseline model for separate analyses
(partially adjusted model). In addition, other potential con-
founders were added in a further fully adjusted model, in
which potential confounding variables were added one by
one, and those judged to be important (i.e. changing the
estimated log HR for BCG vaccination by 60.25 of the
standard error of the log HR) were retained. Variables
relating to lifestyle (smoking status, drinking behaviour,
drug use) were included as a block in this procedure. Any
remaining variables were then added again one by one to
the model and assessed for retention as before.
Analyses were conducted first for those who had com-
plete data on the variables included in the final model. In
sensitivity analyses, we fitted the baseline and partially ad-
justed models on all individuals with complete data for the
model in question. Analyses were repeated using multiple im-
putation by chained equations to deal with missing data,
under a ‘missing at random’ (MAR) assumption.23 (See de-
tails in Supplementary Methods, available as Supplementary
Data at IJE online.)
Results
Of 1602 potentially eligible cases, 1047 (65%) were con-
tacted successfully. Of these, 60 were ineligible (not born
in the UK or not White) and 53 had difficulties precluding
participation such as frailty. Of the remaining 934, 257
(28%) refused and 677 (72%) were enrolled.17 Of those
enrolled, 534 (80%) had pulmonary disease, 85% bac-
teriologically confirmed, the rest had extra-pulmonary dis-
ease of which 53% were laboratory confirmed.
We recruited controls by sampling 9424 residential
addresses. For 13%, the address no longer existed or no
one was at the address after repeated visits on different
days and times. Among 8176 screened addresses, 1790
(22%) had at least one eligible resident. We recruited from
these addresses 1170 controls—a 65% response rate.17
The distribution of visits by time of day and by day of
week was similar in cases and controls.17 The proportions
of contactable cases was slightly lower for those living in
more deprived areas based on IMD quintiles. The propor-
tion of addresses successfully screened to identify eligible
controls
was
similar
across
IMD
quintiles
(see
Supplementary Table 1, available as Supplementary Data
at IJE online). Among eligible cases contacted, the refusal
rate was slightly higher for those living in the least
deprived quintiles. The proportion of addresses success-
fully screened to identify eligible controls was similar
across IMD quintiles. Among subjects identified as eligible
to be controls, the refusal rate was similar across IMD
quintiles,
though
slightly
higher
than
in
cases
(see
Supplementary Figure 1, available as Supplementary Data
at IJE online)
Cases were more likely to be male, more likely to be in
the most deprived IMD quintile, more likely to live in over-
crowded households and had fewer educational qualifica-
tions than controls (Table 1). Cases were more likely to
report regular travel to or a long-term stay (�3 months) in
a high-TB region. A higher proportion of cases than con-
trols reported drinking at a hazardous or harmful level and
reported being a smoker. The proportion of cases reporting
having used class A drugs was twice as high as in controls.
Similarly, a history of having ever been in prison or home-
less was more frequent in cases than controls.
We were unable to trace NHS vaccination records for
96% of participants. For those traced with BCG vaccin-
ation recorded, 94% (34/36) either recalled BCG vaccin-
ation or had a BCG scar. For those traced and no BCG
recorded, 71% had a BCG scar. Records were therefore
not used. As there was a good level of agreement between
self-reported history and scar inspection (86% agreement,
kappa ¼ 0.6, p < 0.001),17 information on self-reported
history and scar examination were combined to classify the
BCG status of participants (as shown in Table 2). Controls
were more likely to have had BCG vaccination than cases.
Estimated effects of BCG vaccine on TB according
to time since vaccination, for each model, are shown in
Table 3. Area-level deprivation and education level met
our retention criterion and were included in the partially
adjusted model. In the fully adjusted model, we adjusted
additionally for smoking, alcohol, use of controlled drugs,
regular travel abroad to a high-TB region, history of home-
lessness and history of prison stays. The remaining
variables (long-term travel abroad to a high-TB region,
average number of people per room, average number of
people per bedroom) did not meet our retention criterion.
In the complete case analyses, fewer than 1% of individ-
uals were excluded because information was missing on
BCG vaccination but a larger proportion were excluded
because of missing information on confounding variables
(17% in the fully adjusted model). The baseline model
shows evidence of a moderate protective effect of BCG up
to 25 years post vaccination (Table 3). This was attenuated
in the partially adjusted model: the protective effect 20–25
years post vaccination was low. Results were similar,
though with narrower confidence intervals (CIs), when the
baseline and partially adjusted models included all subjects

 with complete data for those models (see Supplementary
Table 2, available as Supplementary Data at IJE online).
Based on the fully adjusted model, there was good evidence
of a protective effect of BCG 10–15 years (HR 0.49, 95%
CI 0.31, 0.79) and 15–20 years (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.28,
0.67) since vaccination. The protective effect was lower
after 20 years: and 20–25 years (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.49,
1.14) and 25–29 years (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.53, 1.84) since
vaccination. These estimates correspond to a VE of 51%,
57%, 25% and 1%, 10–15, 15–20, 20–25 and 25–29 years
since vaccination, respectively.
The results based on multiple imputation of the missing
data also indicated lower protection more than 20 years
after BCG vaccination (Table 3). Estimated VEs were
56%, 57%, 25% and 21%, 10–15, 15–20, 20–25 and 25–
29 years since vaccination, respectively.
The association between BCG vaccination and log haz-
ard of TB modelled using restricted cubic splines with three
knots at 15, 20 and 25 years post vaccination did not fit

 the data better than the linear model (based on the AIC).
Results from analyses based on the simpler linear model
suggested an estimated 7% (95% CI: 0.2–12%) increase in
the log of the HR with each year from 10 years post vac-
cination (Figure 1). The results using multiple imputation
were similar to those from the complete case analysis, sug-
gesting some protective effect of the vaccine up to about 25
years post vaccination. The spline model suggested a fairly
constant level of vaccine effectiveness up to around
17 years post vaccination, and then a steeper reduction in
the VE after that (see Supplementary Figure 2, available as
Supplementary Data at IJE online).
Discussion
Based on a large, population-based case–control study,
there was about a 50% protection against TB between 10
and 20 years following school-aged BCG vaccination, with
little evidence of good protection after 20 years. Although
numbers were small, there appeared to be subsequent wan-
ing in protection. Results from complete case analyses and
multiple imputation to deal with missing data were
consistent.
We had a moderately good response rate from cases
and controls recruited to represent the children born in the
UK in the general population. As we were able to locate

vaccination, this was categorized as a convincing history; if only recall of BCG at school, it was categorized as probable. bSensitivity analysis moving this category
to the vaccinated did not change the effect estimate of the association between BCG and TB and had small numbers; they were therefore assigned to the vaccinated
category in the rest of the results.

 few vaccination records, we relied upon self-report of BCG
vaccination and inspection of participants for BCG scars to
ascertain BCG vaccination status. The correspondence be-
tween the histories and the scar inspections was good.
There was some confounding in estimating the protective
effect of BCG, due to lower BCG uptake in poorer subjects
who had a higher risk of TB, but we were able to control
for this in the analysis.
A limitation in our approach was the inability to assess
and exclude subjects who had a positive TST in the school
vaccination programme, who would have been ineligible
for vaccination. Retrospective ascertainment of results of
TST testing based on recall was not feasible, and partici-
pants’ recall could not be validated in the absence of re-
cords. Persons who have a positive response to a TST are
known to be at higher risk of TB during the first few years
after testing. However, follow-up data from the British
MRC BCG trial in adolescents showed that, in that low-
transmission setting, the risk of TB in participants with a
positive TST test declined over time, and was similar to
that of subjects who were TST-negative at baseline by
about 10 years after enrolment24,25 (see Figure 11 in ref.
17 for details). Thus, not taking account of the TST results
is unlikely to bias the association between BCG vaccin-
ation and TB beyond 10 years after vaccination. Also, ex-
trapolation from modelling work26 suggests that, in our
study, the prevalence of tuberculin positivity in the White
population would have been no greater than 4% at the
time and age of screening for vaccination.
Other limitations include the possibility that subjects
taking part are more likely to have been vaccinated than
those not contactable or who had refused. Cases were
somewhat harder to contact than controls. Together with a
higher response rate in cases than in controls, this might, if
anything, have acted to underestimate the protective effect
of BCG. After 20 years, a protective effect could no longer
be detected after adjustment for confounding in the base-
line model. Control for a wide range of confounders made
little difference to the HR 10–20 years after vaccination,
suggesting that, if there were any other unmeasured con-
founders or residual confounding, they may have limited
effect.
This study provides evidence that adds to that from the
original UK MRC trial, in which protection of 63% was
reported 10–15 years after vaccination (with wide 95% CI,
17–84%). In that trial, there was no evidence of protection
15–20 years after vaccination but the numbers of cases
were small and the CI consequently very wide (VE 9%,
95% CI < 0–71%).24 The apparent waning of protection
after 20 years has also been seen in Norway, where moder-
ately good protection was noted for 10–19 years after
childhood BCG (VE 58%, CI 27%, 76%) and lower pro-
tection 20–29 years after vaccination (VE 38%, CI –32 to
71%).14 In a Brazilian cohort, protection in 15- to 20-
year-olds after infant BCG vaccination was 39% (9–58%),
but with no data in older individuals.27 Other evidence for
the duration of protection in high-prevalence settings is
limited. A protective effect was noted in a case–control
study in Saudi Arabian 15- to 24-year-olds after infant
BCG vaccination (VE 67%, 95% CI 55–77%), but not in
25- to 34-year-olds (VE 20%, CI –6 to 37%).28 In con-
trast, in an extended follow-up of a BCG trial in US
Native-Americans, protection up to 60 years was re-
ported.13 However, it is unclear whether such a long
follow-up might have acted to select those at lower risk of
TB. The above studies also do not indicate whether the
protective effect of BCG in childhood is more durable,
when it is assumed immune responses are better, than in
infancy.
It has been suggested that, in high-transmission settings
and areas closer to the equator, masking of the effect of
BCG occurs by infection or sensitization by environmental
mycobacteria increasingly providing, over time, some pro-
tection in the unvaccinated.5,6,29,30 The studies so far on
durability of BCG have limited information with which to
assess the role of masking.
In summary, our case–control study suggests BCG vac-
cination
in
UK-born
adolescents
provided
protection
against tuberculosis for at least 20 years. BCG at school
age may have helped in the control of TB, including reduc-
ing the risk of multidrug-resistant disease, as those vacci-
nated around 13 years of age have been protected into
adulthood. WHO’s End TB strategy notes the importance

 of continuing infant BCG vaccination in high-prevalence
settings.31,32 We suggest also including a recommendation
for childhood vaccination when infant vaccination has not
been given. Our finding of longer duration of BCG protec-
tion may be helpful for countries assessing the cost-
effectiveness of BCG in the prevention of tuberculosis. It
also has implications for assessing new vaccines against tu-
berculosis, which should desirably provide protection that
is greater than that from BCG and which might also be ex-
pected to provide lasting protection, although assessment
of the latter would, in the short term, have to be based on
immunological characteristics.
