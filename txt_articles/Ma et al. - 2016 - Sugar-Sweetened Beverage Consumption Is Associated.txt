bdominal adipose tissue, particularly visceral adipose tissue 
(V
AT), has been linked to the development of type 2 dia-
betes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.1 Imaging techniques 
such as computed tomography (CT) can be exploited to assess 
the quantity of abdominal adipose tissue, including V
AT and sub-
cutaneous adipose tissue (SAT).2 In addition, the quality of V
AT 
and SAT can be indirectly assessed by adipose tissue attenuation 
obtained from CT images.3 From the CT images, the radioden-
sity range from −195 to −45 Hounsfield units (HU) is typically 
attributed to adipose tissue.4 Within this HU range, a lower HU 
in adipose tissue can be used as a proxy for lower fat quality.5,6 
Studies have shown that both quantity and quality of abdominal 
adipose tissue were associated with cardiometabolic risk.2,3

Clinical Perspective on p 377
Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) are the largest contrib-
utor of added sugar intake in the US.7 Added sugar consumed 
from SSB alone, particularly in low socioeconomic popula-
tions, nearly exceeds the limits of added sugar intake recom-
mended to maintain cardiometabolic health.8,9 Recent data 
from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 
2010 Study showed a significant number of deaths from dia-
betes and cardiovascular disease may be attributed to excess 
SSB intake.10 Sugars added in SSB are either sucrose or high 
fructose corn syrup, which both may contribute to metabolic 
disorders.11,12 In contrast, diet soda is a popular beverage,13 
which contains no calories from added sugar. In a previous 
cross-sectional analysis of data from the Framingham Heart 
Study, SSB intake rather than diet soda intake was associated 
with VAT volume.14 This observation was consistent with 1 
other cross-sectional study.15 However, these studies were lim-
ited by the cross-sectional design because the temporality of 
the association was not able to be established.
To date, data examining the association between either 
habitual intake of SSB or diet soda on the change in quantity 
Background—Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake has been linked to abnormal abdominal adipose tissue. We examined 
the prospective association of habitual SSB intake and change in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose 
tissue.
Methods and Results—The quantity (volume, cm3) and quality (attenuation, Hounsfield Unit) of abdominal adipose tissue 
were measured using computed tomography in 1003 participants (mean age 45.3 years, 45.0% women) at examination 
1 and 2 in the Framingham’s Third Generation cohort. The 2 exams were ≈6 years apart. At baseline, SSB and diet soda 
intake were assessed using a valid food frequency questionnaire. Participants were categorized into 4 groups: none to <1 
serving/mo (nonconsumers), 1 serving/mo to <1 serving/week, 1 serving/week to 1 serving/d, and ≥1 serving/d (daily 
consumers) of either SSB or diet soda. After adjustment for multiple confounders including change in body weight, 
higher SSB intake was associated with greater change in VAT volume (P trend<0.001). VAT volume increased by 658 
cm3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 602 to 713), 649 cm3 (95% CI, 582 to 716), 707 cm3 (95% CI, 657 to 757), and 852 
cm3 (95% CI, 760 to 943) from nonconsumers to daily consumers. Higher SSB intake was also associated with greater 
decline of VAT attenuation (P trend=0.007); however, the association became nonsignificant after additional adjustment 
for VAT volume change. In contrast, diet soda consumption was not associated with change in abdominal adipose tissue.
Conclusions—Regular SSB intake was associated with adverse change in both 
VAT quality and quantity, whereas we observed 
no such association for diet soda.

and quality in abdominal adipose tissue over time have been 
limited. The objective of the present study was to examine the 
prospective association between habitual intake of SSB or diet 
soda and changes in VAT and SAT assessed by CT over a 6-year 
time frame in the Framingham Heart Study. We hypothesized 
that, independent of change in body weight, higher habitual 
SSB intake would be associated with a greater increase in VAT 
and SAT quantity and a greater decline in the quality of adipose 
tissue in these regions, whereas we hypothesized that no such 
association would be observed with diet soda.
Methods
Study Sample
Study participants were drawn from the Third Generation cohort of 
the Framingham Heart Study, which has been described elsewhere.16 
Enrollment of the Third Generation cohort was initiated in 2002, and 
4095 participants (53.3% women, age range 19–72 years, 99.7% white) 
attended the first examination. In this cohort, participants were evalu-
ated by a physician interview, a physical examination, and standard lab-
oratory assessments of vascular risk factors. Of the 4095 participants 
who attended the first examination (2002–2005), 1994 participants 
underwent a multi-detector CT scan. Among these participants, 1160 
participants also had CT scan at the second examination (2008–2011). 
To be eligible for the CT scan, participants’ body weight had to be <160 
kg because of the CT machine’s restriction for weight. Compared with 
participants who attended both baseline and follow-up examinations 
but had no CT measurements at both exams (n=2251), those with CT 
measurements (n=1160) were older (45.3 versus 37.9 years), less likely 
to be women (44.7% versus 57.3%) or smokers (9.5% versus 16.7%), 
and had slightly higher body mass index (BMI) levels (27.3 versus 26.6 
kg/m2). It should be noted that, to be eligible for CT scans, men had to 
be age ≥35 years and women had to be ≥40 years. In addition, there 
was no substantial difference between the 2 groups for alcohol intake, 
waist circumference, lipid profiles and lipid lowering medication 
usage, antihypertensive medications usage, and fasting plasma glucose 
(all P>0.10). A total of 157 participants were additionally excluded for 
the following reasons: bariatric surgery (n=3), history of hard cardio-
vascular disease (myocardial infarction and stroke, n=9), history of 
cancer (excluding nonmelanotic skin cancer, n=16), missing data for 
SSB or diet soda (n=114), and missing important covariates such as 
physical activity, smoking status, and other dietary assessments (n=15) 
at baseline. The present study was completed on the final sample size 
of 1003 participants. All participants provided written informed con-
sent and the Framingham Heart Study protocols and procedures were 
approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Research at 
Boston University Medical Center.
Abdominal Adipose Tissue
The protocol for measuring abdominal adiposity has been previously 
described.2,3 Briefly, participants underwent an abdominal scanning 
with an 8-slice multi-detector CT scan (LightSpeed Ultra; General 
Electric Health Care). The CT scanning obtained 25 contiguous slices 
covering 125 mm superiorly from the upper edge of the S1 vertebrae. 
Pixels of CT image between −195 to −45 Hounsfield units (HU) were 
defined as adipose tissue. VAT and SAT were separated by manually 
tracing the abdominal muscular wall. The quantity was determined 
by the volume of VAT and SAT, and a ratio of VAT to SAT volume 
(VAT:SAT ratio) was calculated to reflect the propensity of storing fat 
in VAT relative to SAT. The average attenuation (HU) was also mea-
sured as a proxy for VAT and SAT quality. The intraclass correlations 
were >0.99 for both VAT and SAT readings.3
Beverage Consumption
The Harvard semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)17 
was used to assess SSB and diet soda intake at baseline in the Third 
Generation cohort. This FFQ consisted of 126 food items with 
standard serving sizes. There were 9 frequency categories for each 
food item, ranging from none or <1 serving/mo to ≥6 servings/d. 
Dietary assessment was considered valid only if reported energy 
intake was ≥2.5 MJ/d (600 kcal/d) for both men and women, <16.7 
MJ/d (4000 kcal/d) for women, <17.5 MJ/d (4200 kcal/d) for men, 
and if <13 food items were left blank.
To estimate SSB intake, we summed consumption of the follow-
ing 4 types of beverages, including (1) caffeinated colas with sugar, 
(2) caffeine-free colas with sugar, (3) other carbonated beverages with 
sugar, and (4) fruit punches, lemonade, or other noncarbonated fruit 
drinks. Diet soda intake was assessed using the following 3 items: 
(1) low-calorie cola (2) low-calorie, caffeine-free cola, and (3) other 
low-calorie carbonated beverage. The relative validity of the Harvard 
FFQ has been tested by comparing with 7-day dietary records in other 
cohorts.18–20 The correlation coefficient between the FFQ and dietary 
records was 0.51 for SSB and 0.66 for diet soda.21
Anthropometry and Covariate Assessment
Body weight was measured with light clothes, and was rounded to the 
nearest 0.5 pound. Standing height was measured using a vertical ruler, 
and measurement was recorded to the nearest ¼ inch. BMI was calcu-
lated as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2). Current smokers 
were defined when participants reported that they smoked regularly in 
the past year. Physical activity level was estimated using questionnaire-
derived intensity of the activity and time spent on performing the activity 
in a typical day. All dietary factors were estimated using the abovemen-
tioned FFQ including total energy intake (kilocalories/d), saturated fatty 
acids (as % energy intake), alcohol intake (grams/d), multivitamin use 
(yes/no), and intake of individual foods including whole grain (grams/d), 
fruit(grams/d), vegetable (grams/d), coffee (servings/d), nuts (grams/d), 
and fish (grams/d). Type 2 diabetes mellitus was defined as fasting 
plasma glucose ≥7 mmol/L or the use of hypoglycemic medications.
Statistical Analysis
According to the frequency of SSB intake at baseline, we categorized 
participants as nonconsumers (none to <1 serving/mo) and consum-
ers (3 categories): 1 serving/mo to <1 serving/week (occasional con-
sumers), 1 serving/week to 1 serving/d (frequent consumers), and ≥1 
serving/d (daily consumers). The same categorization strategy was 
applied for diet soda too. Mean and standard deviation or proportion 
and frequency were calculated for baseline characteristics of partici-
pants in each beverage consumption category. A median approach 
was used to examine the linear trend across consumption categories. 
The median intake value of SSB or diet soda in one category was 
assigned to all individuals in that category. The statistical significance 
of the linear trend was tested by linear or logistic regression model 
using the median intake value as a continuous independent variable.
Multiple linear regression models were used to examine the pro-
spective association of beverage consumption and change in body 
weight and abdominal adipose tissue (volume and attenuation). Least-
squares means of change in body weight and abdominal adipose tis-
sue were estimated for each beverage consumption category with 
adjustment for baseline outcome values, sex, age, smoking status, 
physical activity level, alcohol intake, daily energy intake, saturated 
fatty acids (% energy), multivitamin use, and intakes of individuals 
foods including whole grain, fruit, vegetable, coffee, nuts, and fish. 
SSB and diet soda were mutually adjusted (ie, diet soda was adjusted 
for in analysis for SSB and vice versa). In a separate model, change 
in body weight was additionally adjusted to assess whether the asso-
ciation was independent of body weight change. To examine whether 
the change in attenuation (HU) was independent of change in volume, 
volume changes in VAT or SAT were additionally adjusted for in the 
analyses for the attenuation change in VAT or SAT. A linear trend 
across beverage categories was performed using the median method 
described above with adjustment for same covariates.
In the secondary analysis, we tested whether sex, BMI, or diabe-
tes mellitus status modified the observed association between bev-
erage intake and abdominal adipose tissue change. A cross-product 
term of beverage intake categories and dichotomous variables of sex,

BMI (<25 and ≥25 kg/m2), or type 2 diabetes mellitus status was 
included in the multiple regression models for trend analysis. The 
significance level for the interaction term was set as P<0.02 (0.05/3) 
to account for multiple comparisons.
All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS statistical soft-
ware (version 9.3; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). A 2-tailed P<0.05 was 
considered statistically significant, unless otherwise specified.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
The majority of our study sample (85%, n=852) consumed 
a mixture of SSB and diet soda, and 1% (n=13) were daily 
consumers of both SSB and diet soda and 14% (n=138) were 
nonconsumers of both types of beverages. Among our study 
participants (Table 1), SSB nonconsumers, occasional, fre-
quent, and daily consumers accounted for 32% (n=317), 20% 
(n=196), 35% (n=356), and 13% (n=134), respectively. SSB 
consumers were more likely to be men, younger, current smok-
ers, engaged in slightly more physical activity, and less likely 
to have diabetes. Also, SSB consumers were not more likely 
to take multivitamins, consumed fewer nuts, and had higher 
daily energy intake. SSB intake was inversely associated with 
diet soda intake. As shown in Table 2, ≈50% (n=501) of study 
participants were diet soda nonconsumers, and 13% (n=128), 
22% (n=221), and 15% (n=153) were occasional, frequent, 
and daily diet soda consumers, respectively. There was no sig-
nificant difference in age, sex, current smoking status between 
diet soda consumption categories. Diet soda consumers were 
less likely to be engaged in physical activity, had higher BMI, 
and had higher prevalence of diabetes. Diet soda intake was 
directly associated with intake of saturated fat, nuts, and veg-
etables, but inversely associated with fruit intake.
SSB and Change in Abdominal Adipose Tissue
Over a 6-year interval, body weight increased by 2.4 kg (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.7–3.2), 2.8 kg (95% CI, 1.8–3.7), 
2.4 kg (95% CI,: 1.7–3.0), and 1.7 kg (95% CI, 0.5–2.9) from 
SSB nonconsumers to daily consumers (Table 3). No signifi-
cant association was observed between SSB intake and change 
in body weight (P trend=0.26).
There was a linear association between SSB intake and 
change in VAT volume (659 cm3 among nonconsumers and 
675, 709, and 809 cm3 in occasional, frequent, and daily con-
sumers, respectively), and this association became statisti-
cally significant after adjustment for change in body weight 
(P trend<0.001). Over follow-up, SAT increased by 586 cm3

(95% CI, 500–672) in nonconsumers and 568 cm3 (95% CI, 
427–709) in daily consumers. SSB intake was not associated 
with change in SAT volume (P trend=0.70 and P trend=0.77 in 
models with additional adjustment for change in body weight).
The attenuation change of VAT was 0.4 HU (95% CI, −0.1 
to 1.0) in nonconsumers and -0.6 HU (95% CI, −1.5 to 0.3) 
in daily consumers. After additional adjustment for change in 
body weight, a higher SSB intake was associated with a greater 
attenuation decline in VAT (P trend=0.007), which became 
nonsignificant on adjustment for change in VAT volume (P 
trend=0.24). We observed that SSB intake was not associated 
with attenuation change in SAT (P trend=0.92 and P trend=0.63 
in model with additional adjustment for change in body weight).
SSB intake was positively associated with change in V
AT:SAT 
ratio (P trend=0.007). The change in V
AT:SAT ratio was 0.09 (95% 
CI, 0.06–0.11) in nonconsumers and 0.15 (95% CI, 0.11–0.18) in 
daily consumers. This association remained significant with 
additional adjustment for body weight change (P trend=0.004).
Diet Soda and Change in Abdominal Adipose Tissue
As shown in Table 4, body weight increased by 2.8 kg (95% CI, 
2.2–3.3), 1.6 kg (95% CI, 0.5–2.7), 1.7 kg (95% CI, 0.8–2.5), and 
2.7 kg (95% CI, 1.7–3.8) from diet soda nonconsumers to daily 
consumers during the 6-year interval. Diet soda intake was not 
associated with change in body weight (P trend=0.96). At fol-
low-up, V
AT volume increased by 709 cm3 (95% CI, 652–766) in 
nonconsumers and 748 cm3 (95% CI, 644–853) in daily consum-
ers, whereas SAT volume increased by 588 cm3 (95% CI, 525–
652) in nonconsumers and 599 cm3 (95% CI, 482–717) in daily 
consumers. There was no association between diet soda intake 
and change in either SAT volume (P trend=0.80) or V
AT volume 
(P trend=0.38). Similarly, attenuation change in either V
AT or 
SAT was similar across diet soda consumption categories. No 
association was observed between diet soda intake and attenua-
tion change in V
AT (P trend=0.72) and SAT (P trend=0.81). Diet 
soda intake was also not associated with change in V
AT:SAT ratio 
(P trend=0.23). Additional adjustment for change in body weight 
did not change the observed associations.
Secondary Analysis
No significant interaction was observed between SSB intake 
and sex, BMI, or type 2 diabetes mellitus on the outcomes 
(Table 3). Nevertheless, sex-specified subgroup analyses were 
conducted for SSB intake (Tables I and II in the online-only 
Data Supplement). The association of higher SSB intake 
and adverse change in volume and attenuation of VAT was 
observed in both men and women (Figure, A and B). A sig-
nificant interaction was observed between sex and diet soda

intake for change in body weight and VAT volume (both P 
interaction=0.01, Table 4). However, diet soda intake was 
not associated with change in body weight or VAT volume in 
either men (Table III in the online-only Data Supplement) or 
women (Table IV in the online-only Data Supplement). The 
sex-specific analyses for diet soda intake and change in VAT 
volume and attenuation are shown in Figure, C and D.
Discussion
Principal Findings
In this prospective observational study of middle-aged adults, 
we observed that individuals who consumed ≥1 serving of SSB 
per day (SSB daily consumers) had a 29% greater increase 
in VAT volume over 6 years compared with nonconsumers. 
Coupled with this greater increase in VAT volume overtime, 
the decline in the attenuation of VAT was greater among daily 
SSB consumers as compared with SSB nonconsumers. In 
contrast, we observed no significant association between SSB 
intake and change in either volume or attenuation of SAT. In 
addition, we observed no significant association between diet 
soda intake and change in volume and attenuation of abdomi-
nal adipose tissue. Taken together, these findings suggest that 
habitual SSB intake was associated with a long-term adverse 
change in visceral adiposity (ie, increased VAT volume and 
decrease in VAT attenuation), independent of weight gain.
In the Context of Current Literature
In our previous study, using data collected from 2596 par-
ticipants in the Framingham Offspring and Third Generation 
cohorts, we examined the cross-sectional association of SSB 
intake and abdominal adipose tissue.14 In that study, SSB con-
sumption was associated with greater VAT and greater VAT:SAT 
ratio after adjustment for potential confounders. Similarly, a 
cross-sectional study conducted in 791 non-Hispanic white 
adults showed that regular SSB intake was positively associated 
with the ratio of VAT to overall abdominal adipose tissue.15 As 
far as we are aware, our study is the first observational study to 
prospectively link SSB consumption patterns to changes in VAT 
volume over time. Our findings are supported by a small (n=47) 
randomized intervention trial,22 which demonstrated that a high 
daily consumption of 1 L of SSB for 6 months led to a 23% 
increase in VAT volume. As such, our data, together with others, 
support the hypothesis that regular SSB consumption may be 
associated with adverse changes in VAT.
In addition to VAT volume, it has been shown that adipose 
tissue attenuation is a marker of metabolic risk.3 A lower HU 
reflects high lipid content in adipose tissue,5,6 and perhaps a 
damaged cell growth (ie, adipocyte hypertrophy).23,24 In the 
present study, we found that increased SSB intake was associ-
ated with a worsening (ie, lower) adipose tissue attenuation over 
time. Although evidence from human studies is limited, feeding

a high fructose diet (fructose accounting for 30% of energy) for 
8 weeks significantly increased volume of intra-abdominal adi-
pose tissue, as well as the size of adipocytes in this tissue com-
pared with a standard chow diet in male Sprague-Dawley rats.25 
In contrast, this animal study observed no effect of high-fruc-
tose diet on SAT, which is consistent with our observation that 
SSB intake was not associated with SAT attenuation in humans. 
However, lipid metabolism and the structure of adipose tissue in 
rats are different from humans, and the actual intake of fructose 
in the human diet is lower than 30% of energy intake.26 Further 
studies in humans that seek to examine the relationship of SSB 
or added sugar intake and VAT quality are needed.
Multiple factors may confound our lack of association 
between baseline SSB intake and weight change. Participants 
may have stopped drinking SSB after the baseline examination. 
It is also possible that some individuals, particularly those with 
overweight and obesity, may underestimate their SSB intake.27
Potential Mechanisms
Several mechanisms may explain the observed association 
between SSB intake and adverse changes in V
AT. Under normal 
conditions, circulating triglycerides deposition is more efficient 
in SAT compared with V
AT because lipoprotein lipase, the rate-
limiting enzyme, is more sensitive to insulin in SAT than that in 
V
AT.28,29 In contrast, under conditions of insulin resistance, lipo-
protein lipase activity in SAT may be suppressed28,29 and greater 
amounts of triglycerides flux in V
AT. It has been hypothesized that 
excess fructose, the major component in SSB, may trigger insu-
lin resistance and increase fat accumulation in V
AT.30 Fructose is 
primarily metabolized in the liver, where it is converted to triglyc-
erides.31 This pathway is not regulated by phosphofructokinase, 
the main rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis.32 When triglycerides 
are over produced, some may convert to intermediate products 
such as diacylglycerols, which may impair insulin signaling path-
ways.33 It is also possible that fructose may directly promote fat 
deposition in V
AT by activating intracellular glucocorticoids.34 
Because glucocorticoids receptors are more prominent in VAT 
than SAT,28 triglycerides may be more likely to be stored in 
VAT when excess SSB is consumed. Nevertheless, the exact 
underlying mechanisms remain to be determined.
Implications
Excess SSB consumption has been linked to increased risk 
of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.35 The 
present study provides a useful hypothesis for further analysis 
regarding the pathways leading SSB to cardiometabolic dis-
eases. SSB consumption is currently high in both children and 
adults, particularly in populations with low socioeconomic 
status.8 Our findings also emphasize the importance of the 
current dietary guideline recommendations36 (ie, limiting SSB 
consumption as much as possible may be an efficient strategy 
to reduce the burden of cardiometabolic disease).

Strengths and Limitations
Strengths of the present study include its prospective study 
design with utilization of highly specific and reproducible 
measurements of abdominal adipose tissue, and compre-
hensive dietary, lifestyle, and clinical data collected in the 
Framingham Heart Study. With respect to limitations, given 
that the majority of the study sample were white, this limits 
the generalizability to other ethnically diverse populations. In 
the present study sample, only 1 estimate of SSB or diet soda 
intake was assessed at baseline. We cannot rule out that partic-
ipants may have changed their beverage consumption intake 
over time. In addition, beverages such as sports drinks, energy 
drinks, and sweetened teas were not specifically assessed by 
the FFQ. Individuals with overweight or obesity may under-
estimate their SSB intake,27 which may partly explain why we 
observed no association between SSB intake and change in 
body weight. However, this type of misclassification is likely 
to attenuate our findings to the null rather than strengthen the 
association between SSB intake and change in VAT. Therefore, 
it is unlikely to account for our primary findings. We adjusted 
for a variety of dietary and lifestyle factors, but residual con-
founding may still exist. Finally, the assessment of diet soda 
intake did not include all consumption of low calorie and arti-
ficially sweetened, noncarbonated beverages.
Conclusions
Regular SSB intake at baseline was associated with an adverse 
change in VAT in a group of middle-aged adults over 6 years 
of follow-up. In contrast, we observed no such association for 
diet soda intake. The present study supports current dietary 
recommendations that limiting SSB consumption may be 
helpful to prevent cardiometabolic diseases.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
Excess sugar-sweetened beverage consumption has been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 dia-
betes mellitus. In this study, we conducted a prospective observational study that examined the association between habitual 
intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and change in visceral adipose tissue. We examined data collected from 1,003 middle-
age adults, mean age 45.3 years and 45% women, who attended the Framingham Heart Study’s Third Generation Cohort. 
These participants were examined at baseline and approximately 6 years later. This study demonstrated a dose–response 
relationship between sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and change in visceral adipose tissue. Higher sugar-sweetened 
beverage consumption was associated with higher fat accumulation and adverse change of quality in visceral adipose tis-
sue. Our findings provide evidence for further studies regarding underlying mechanisms leading sugar-sweetened beverage 
intake to cardiometabolic diseases. Our observations highlight the importance of the current dietary recommendations to 
limit sugar-sweetened beverage consumption.
