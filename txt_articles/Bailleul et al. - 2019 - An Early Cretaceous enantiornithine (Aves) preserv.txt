Understanding non-crown dinosaur reproduction is hindered by a paucity of directly asso-
ciated adults with reproductive traces. Here we describe a new enantiornithine, Avimaia
schweitzerae gen. et sp. nov., from the Lower Cretaceous Xiagou Formation with an unlaid egg
two-dimensionally preserved within the abdominothoracic cavity. Ground-sections reveal
abnormal eggshell proportions, and multiple eggshell layers best interpreted as a multi-
layered egg resulting from prolonged oviductal retention. Fragments of the shell membrane
and cuticle are both preserved. SEM reveals that the cuticle consists of nanostructures
resembling those found in neornithine eggs adapted for infection-prone environments, which
are hypothesized to represent the ancestral avian condition. The femur preserves small
amounts of probable medullary bone, a tissue found today only in reproductively active
female birds. To our knowledge, no other occurrence of Mesozoic medullary bone is asso-
ciated with indications of reproductive activity, such as a preserved egg, making our identi-
fication unique, and strongly supported.

n nearly every aspect, modern birds (neornithines) are highly
modified from the typical reptilian condition1. Although many
avian skeletal features were absent in stem birds (e.g., a keeled
sternum, a beak, a pygostyle), new information is making it
increasingly clear that many soft-tissue and behavioral features
associated with extant birds had their origins among the Dino-
sauria2. Avian reproduction is no exception—birds are the only
living amniotes with a single functional ovary and oviduct and are
additionally characterized by proportionately large eggs1, a high
degree of parental care1, and the use of medullary bone (MB), an
ephemeral tissue that serves as a calcium reservoir for eggshell
production during the reproductive cycle3–5. In the fossil record,
adults directly associated with reproductive traces are extremely
rare, but some key specimens have recently led to important
discoveries about the evolution of the modern avian mode of
reproduction. For example, preserved soft tissues interpreted as
ovarian follicles suggest stem birds had already lost function of
the right ovary6,7, and the histology of one specimen of Tyr-
annosaurus rex suggests that MB evolved well outside the avian
clade4,8.
Here we describe an important new specimen of enantior-
nithine bird preserving a wealth of reproductive features and
information, including a flattened intra-abdominal egg and traces
of MB. The specimen comes from the Lower Cretaceous Xiagou
Formation and represents a new taxon, Avimaia schweitzerae gen.
et sp. nov. We investigate the preserved egg through standard
paleohistological methods, scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). We discuss the
implications of these findings in context of our understanding of
dinosaur reproduction and the evolution of the specialized crown
avian condition.

 Locality and horizon. Near Changma Village, Yumen City, Gansu
Province, northwestern China; Lower Cretaceous (lower–middle
Aptian) Xiagou Formation10.
Diagnosis. Small-bodied enantiornithine (robust, cranially forked
pygostyle, distal condyles of tibiotarsus contacting medially, J-
shaped metatarsal I, metatarsal IV mediolaterally reduced relative
to metatarsals III and IV, metatarsal IV trochlea reduced to single
condyle; Supplementary Note 1) with the following autapomor-
phies: pubis delicate and strongly curved so that the caudal
margin is concave throughout; distal end of ischium dorsally
curved.
Description. Seven thoracic vertebrae with spool-like centra
precede the synsacrum, which consists of at least eight fully fused
vertebrae (Fig. 1b). The synsacral neural spines, visible in the
computed tomography (CT)-scans, form a low, continuous ridge
on the dorsal surface (Fig. 1). Typical of enantiornithines, the
pygostyle is craniodorsally forked proximally with ventrolateral
processes extending most of its length11; the distal end is broken.
Fusion of the pelvis at the acetabulum cannot be determined.
The cranial margin of the ilium is rounded and the dorsal margin
is gently convex. The preacetabular process is longer and broader
than the triangular postacetabular process (Fig. 1). Visible on the
right, the dorsolateral surface forms a low ridge that is also
present in Sinornis12 (Fig. 1b). The pubic peduncle of the ischium
is broader than that of the ilium. The craniodorsally oriented
dorsal process of the ischium contacts—but is not fused to—the
ilium, demarcating an ilioischiadic foramen, as in Qiliania and
PVL 4032–3 (Fundación-Instituto Miguel Lillo)11,13. The body of
the ischium is distally tapered and curved dorsally. As in CAGS-
IG-04-CM-007 9, the pubic shaft is long and delicate and the
distal third is strongly recurved such that it is orientated at nearly
90° from the main portion of the shaft (ventrally deflected in
Qiliania13; robust and only weakly curved in Feitianius14). The
distal ends are not fused but may have been in contact medially in
life.
The femur is nearly straight with a posterior trochanter
excavating its proximomedial surface, as in other enantior-
nithines11. The patellar groove is very weakly developed. The
tibiotarsus is fully fused such that the ascending process of the
astragalus cannot be discerned (forms a raised surface in
Qiliania13). The proximocaudal surface bears two tubercles
previously interpreted as the facies articularis lateralis and
popliteal tubercle in pengornithids14. Proximomedial excavation
is probably a diagenetic artifact. The fibular crest is short (14%
the length of the tibiotarsus) and located well distal to the
proximal articular surface. The distal condyles are large, round,
and contact medially. The medial surface of the medial condyle is
nearly flat (concave in Qiliania13). Only a fragment of the left
fibula is preserved.
The distal tarsals are fully fused to the metatarsals, which are
co-planar and unfused throughout their lengths. Metatarsal III is
the longest; metatarsal IV is longer than II, which terminates level
with the proximal end of the metatarsal III trochlea. Metatarsal II
has a tubercle for the attachment of the m. tibialis cranialis
located one-fifth from the proximal end on the craniolateral
surface contacting metatarsal III. A deep intertrochlear incision is
present between metatarsals II and III, probably resultant from
post-mortem plantar displacement of metatarsal II. The meta-
tarsal II trochlea is angled so that the medial margin is proximal
to the lateral margin and the trochlear condyles are only weakly
separated. The trochlea of metatarsal IV is reduced to a single
condyle as in most enantiornithines15. The condyle is angled
plantarolaterally, extending weakly onto the dorsal surface of
metatarsal III just proximal to its trochlea. Metatarsal I articulates
on the medial surface of metatarsal II as in all enantiornithines.
Exposed in craniomedial view, it is J-shaped with the trochlear
ramus measuring approximately two-thirds of the length of the
metatarsal shaft, proportionally shorter than in other enantior-
nithines
(half
of
the
shaft
length
in
Qiliania13,
less
in
Feitianius14).
Pedal digit II is more robust than III and IV with a slightly
larger ungual phalanx. The penultimate phalanx of digit II is 50%
longer than the first phalanx. Digit III includes three long non-
ungual phalanges, with the proximal and penultimate phalanges
being subequal in length and longer than the intermediate
phalanx. Digit IV is mostly not exposed.
Short body feathers are preserved in the caudodorsal region,
extending over the pygostyle where they become slightly longer
(Fig. 1). Elongate ornamental tail feathers appear to be absent.
Egg microstructure. A two-dimensionally flattened egg is pre-
served, laterally bound by the left and right pubes, extending
caudally from the penultimate thoracic vertebra and truncating
just cranial to the pygostyle (Fig. 1; Supplementary Figs. 1–2). The
egg occupies an area measuring approximately 5.2 cm2 (Fig. 1)
with a thickness between 200 and 400 µm (Fig. 2). Two petro-
graphic ground-sections reveal between four and six compacted
layers of eggshell, highly diagenetically altered by dissolution and
recrystallization (Fig. 2). EDS indicates the eggshell has been
dolomitized, so that it now contains a relatively high amount of
magnesium (Supplementary Note 2). Dolomitization is not
uncommon in fossil eggshells16. The eggshell layers are adjacent
(closely adhering) in some regions (Fig. 2d) and separated by
sediments in others (Fig. 2c, f–g). The general topography and
organization of the eggshell layers, the numerous breakages, and
the presence of sediment between layers suggests they have
undergone substantial post-mortem displacement and shear as
the egg was collapsed into a two-dimensional structure (Fig. 2f).
The first ground section (Fig. 2a) reveals four distinct layers of
eggshell that are each approximately 50 µm thick, with the top
two layers a mirror-image of the bottom two layers (Fig. 2d, e).
The eggshell displays a distinctly avian microstructure17 consist-
ing of three sub-layers: a mammillary layer with very few visible
organic cores, a prismatic layer, and a very thin external layer
(Fig. 2e). This tripartite organization is clearest in the two inner
eggshell layers, whereas the outer eggshell layers lack visible
organic cores (Fig. 2d, e). The eggshell preserved in IVPP V25371
is thinner than any previously reported enantiornithine egg-
shell17. The continuous layer (prismatic and external layers
combined) is thinner than the mammillary layer (cl:ml ratio =
0.58:1) whereas in previously reported enantiornithines17 and
neornithines18, the continuous layer is thicker, typically twice
the thickness of the mammillary layer (e.g., cl:ml ratio of 2:1;
or 1.9:1)17.
An additional dark brown layer is preserved in some regions
(Fig. 2b). SEM and EDS indicate this layer is enriched in
phosphorus compared to the rest of the eggshell, suggesting this
represents part of the eggshell cuticle (Fig. 3a–c) (Supplementary
Note 2), which is high in phosphorous content in extant
birds19,20. EDS of the surrounding sediment confirms that this
enrichment in phosphorus is endogenous to the cuticle layer and
is not a contaminant (Supplementary Note 2). SEM also further
indicates this layer consists of spherical nanostructures of calcium
phosphate (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Note 2). Similar nanospheres
are present in the cuticle of some extant birds, such as the
Japanese quail (Fig. 3d), although within Neornithes cuticle
nanostructures occur in a variety of shapes and sizes21,22.
Parts of what appears to be the organic shell membrane are
also visible in both the petrographic slides (Fig. 2b) and SEM

 images (Fig. 3a). In neornithines, the shell membrane (also called
the Membrana Testacea) consists of proteinaceous fibrils of
various sizes23. In Avimaia, these fibrils are between ~1.5 μm
(Fig. 2b) and 4 μm thick (Fig. 3a). Both their size and morphology
are within the range of those found in modern avian shell
membrane23 and similar to the permineralized fibers previously
reported in other dinosaur eggs, including another fossil avian
eggshell from the Late Cretaceous24–26. However, EDS analysis of
the shell membrane suggests that very few of the original organic
components are preserved (Supplementary Note 2).
Femoral histology. Histological examination of the right femur
(Fig. 4) reveals a thin compacta of nearly avascular cortical bone
(CB) and the presence of very small amounts of a darker endo-
steal bone lining the medullary cavity, which we interpret as MB.
The compacta consists almost entirely of parallel-fibered bone
(Fig. 4b, d). A thin inner circumferential layer (ICL) of endo-
steally derived lamellar bone separates the MB from the CB
(Fig. 4c). Each of these layers is separated by a clear line of
resorption (Fig. 4c). Like the eggshell, the CB is heavily altered,
displaying irregular and often confluent osteocyte lacunae
(Fig.4c–d)
typical
of
post-mortem
microbial
invasions27.
The density of these microbial invasions is increased just below
the periosteal surface (Fig. 4c), whereas a very thin band of the
outermost bone (Fig. 4c) appears almost unaffected by these
microbial invasions (Fig. 4c). A similar pattern is very commonly
observed in archeological specimens and suggests that the post-
mortem microbial invasion stopped before the entirety of the
bone was affected28. Under normal light the intact periosteal bone
external to the microbial invasion may superficially resemble an
outer circumferential layer29 (OCL), but polarized light analysis
reveals no significant differences in birefringence when compared
to the rest of the CB (Supplementary Fig. 3).
The CB is poorly vascularized by a very small number of
longitudinal
vascular canals indicating
slow growth.
It is
interrupted by a single line of arrested growth (Fig. 4c), indicating
that this specimen was at least 1-year old. Because no OCL29 is
present and the ICL is proportionately thin, we infer IVPP
V25371 had not reached full skeletal maturity.

Fig. 2 Light microscopy reveals multiple layers of eggshell, compacted and disturbed by sediments. The two-dimensionally preserved egg reveals between
four and six layers in cross-section (a). Parts of the cuticle (cu, dark brown layer) and shell membrane (sm) are also preserved (b). A close-up of the shell
membrane (pink box) shows some fibrils (pink arrows), that are proteinaceous in living birds, but in this case might be at least partially mineralized. The
eggshell layers are highly diagenetically altered (c, d). A four-layered area with a mirror-image pattern most likely represents an abnormal double-layered
egg (d, e) that displays the tripartite ornithoid microstructure typically found in avian eggshells: a mammillary layer (ml) with organic cores (white arrows),
a prismatic layer (pl), and an external layer (el). However, this mirror-image pattern (e) could also be the product of sediment displacement and lithostatic
compaction, as exemplified in a second ground section (f, g). In this section (g), sediment displacement and shear have also partially created a mirror-
image pattern, mimicking an abnormal multi-layered eggshell (f). Scale bar is 500 μm in a and g; 50 μm in b, 100 μm in c, d and f; and 20 μm in e

 At low magnification, the MB consists of a thin, dark brown
layer, with some short trabeculae extending into the medullary
cavity (Fig. 4). The MB can clearly be distinguished by its color
from the lighter colored CB. The endosteal surface of the MB is
scalloped, indicating active resorption at the time of death
(Fig. 4c). The MB has very few osteocyte lacunae and those
present are elongated (Fig. 4d). Polarized light reveals a lamellar
organization of the collagen fibers (Fig. 4d).
Interpretation of preserved eggshell. We interpret the entire
preserved eggshell structure as a single egg with an additional,
abnormal layer of eggshell, that has been crushed flat and dis-
turbed by sediments during diagenesis. Although multiple layers
are preserved, if two eggs were present the top two eggshell layers
should mirror each other, as should the bottom two layers.
Instead the top two layers mirror the bottom two layers (Fig. 2e).
Although only one small fragment of the egg was histologically
sampled, the entire structure was analyzed through CT and the
data show no indication that a second egg was present (Supple-
mentary Fig. 2). Our interpretation that only a single egg is
present is consistent with evidence from preserved soft-tissue and
nests that suggest stem birds (and possibly troodontids) had only
a single functional ovary and would have laid one egg per day7.
Four closely adhering layers of eggshell with the top two layers
mirroring the bottom two layers (Fig. 2d, e) are not apparent
throughout the entirety of the ground-sections (Fig. 2c, f, g). In
some areas only two mirrored layers are visible with additional
layers present but separated by matrix and not forming a clearly
double-layered (on top and bottom) structure (Fig. 2c). There are
two possible interpretations: either the second layer of eggshell
detached from the inner layer during diagenesis in some regions
(and was lost in some areas), which frequently occurs in the extra
layers of modern bird eggs when this abnormality is reported30,31,
or the four-layered, mirror-image pattern observed in the first
section (Fig. 2d, e) is the product of complex lithostatic
compaction, post-mortem folding, and sediment displacement
of a single-layered eggshell. It is often difficult to make this
differentiation in fossils32,33. In the second ground section (Fig. 2f,
g), the bottom-most layer has clearly been displaced and sheared
and in fact belongs to the layer now located above it (Fig. 2f). This
exemplifies how sediment displacement can create a mirror-
image pattern mimicking a multilayered egg.
Additional
CT-scan
data
with
extremely
high-resolution
capable of reconstructing the layers throughout the entire egg
may be able to distinguish between these two hypotheses in the
future. However, three lines of evidence indicate that at this time,
the preserved structure is best interpreted as an abnormal, double-
shelled egg that has been somewhat obscured by diagenesis. First,
the observed eggshell layers are not morphologically consistent
throughout: the mammillary layer in the outer layers of eggshell
lacks visible organic cores and it appears only the inner layer has
cuticle (Fig. 2d, e). If the layers are all from a single-layered egg
this difference in morphology between inner and outer layers
should not exist. Secondly, the absence of visible organic cores
only in the outer layers strongly suggests that fewer nucleation

 sites were available during the formation of the outer eggshell
layer. This often occurs in the outer layers of abnormal
multilayered non-avian dinosaur eggs34. Finally, the proportions
of the layers making up the eggshell microstructure are atypical
further supporting inferences that the reproductive system in this
individual was disrupted. In all healthy neornithine eggs18,35 and
in previously reported enantiornithine eggs17, the continuous layer
is thicker than the mammillary layer (typically cl:ml ratio = 2:1),
whereas the opposite condition is present in IVPP V25371 (cl:ml
ratio = 0.58:1). The presence of a cuticle (Figs. 2b, 3) indicates that
the formation of the continuous layer had terminated and that its
unusually thin morphology is not because it was incomplete. This
strongly suggests that the reproductive system of Avimaia IVPP
V25371 was not functioning normally, supporting interpretations
regarding additional egg abnormalities.
Discussion
Reports of dinosaur specimens preserved with eggs, or other key
reproductive features such as ovarian follicles, preserved within
the body cavity, are extremely rare7,36,37. The holotype of
A. schweitzerae is the only fossil bird ever reported with an
unlaid, intra-abdominal egg. The total evidence from the pre-
served eggshell microstructure combined with histological data
inform on a number of important evolutionary questions per-
taining to the origins of the specialized form of reproduction
present in modern birds (Fig. 5).
The eggshell preserved in IVPP V25371 is abnormally thin, as
indicated by the unusual proportions of the continuous layer
relative to the mammillary layer. Eggshell thinning in extant birds
is often attributed to environmental pollutants38 but can also be
caused by a hormonal imbalance39. The egg is also best interpreted
as having two layers of eggshell (Fig. 2e). Multilayered (including
double-layered) eggs are common in non-avian dinosaurs and in
both fossil and extant turtles, and are commonly referred in the
literature as pathological or abnormal31,32,34,40. Because these
types of eggs have been described in fossils more extensively than
in extant species, more data are necessary to fully understand the
cause of these numerous abnormalities preserved in the fossil
record41. However, multilayered eggs clearly do not represent the
normal, healthy condition. It has been suggested that they repre-
sent an ubiquitous response to stress in the many lineages in
which they occur31,34.
Modern eggs with multiple layers of eggshell are caused by
abnormal, prolonged retention in the oviduct, which is often
attributed to various types of physiological and/or environmental
stresses31,41–45. Although this condition is common in non-avian
dinosaurs and turtles31,32,34,40, multilayered eggshells appear to
be comparatively rare in modern birds, to our knowledge only
reported in a handful of species (the chicken44,46,47, the Herring
Gull48, the Japanese Quail31 and the Tropical mockingbird30),
and this condition has not been previously reported in any fossil
bird. If this is not the product of a sampling bias, it is unclear why
this condition would be less common in Neornithes compared to
more basal reptiles but it may be related to physiological changes
in crownward avians.
In modern birds, the eggshell cuticle reportedly only forms an
hour before oviposition49. Avimaia IVPP V25371 appears to
preserve parts of the cuticle layer. If our interpretation is incorrect
and the egg is not multilayered, this suggests eggshell formation
was completed but the bird died within the hour after cuticle
formation before oviposition. However, we infer that the eggshell
is double-layered and note that the cuticle only appears to be
present on the inner eggshell layer (Figs. 2, 3). This strongly
suggests that after eggshell formation was complete (as evidenced
by the cuticle), the egg was abnormally retained within the ovi-
duct where it received a second layer of eggshell. This evidence
suggesting prolonged egg retention, together with the fact the egg
is preserved still inside the body, brings us to speculate that
Avimaia IVPP V25371 may have suffered from a serious

 condition known as egg binding (also referred to as egg impac-
tion). This condition, in which the egg becomes completely stuck
inside the body, is a form of aggravated egg retention42,45. Egg
binding is common in small, domestic birds45,50, also occurring
in the wild51, and typically results in death unless the egg is
manually or surgically extracted. Thus, it is possible that IVPP
V25371 died as a direct result of the abnormal egg preserved
inside it. If correct, this would represent the oldest documented
occurrence of this common reproductive disorder. The alternative
hypothesis, based on the timing of cuticle formation of healthy
avian eggs49, that Avimaia IVPP V25371 died within the hour
before oviposition due to causes unrelated to egg retention or
binding, while gravid with an abnormal egg, is possible but seems
less likely given the multiple lines of evidence indicating dys-
function of the reproductive system.
The egg preserved in Avimaia IVPP V25371 also offers insight
into the evolution of the avian cuticle. Fossilized cuticles are
rarely reported, but remnants are known from non-avian ther-

eggshells.
However,
none
reported the presence of nanospheres of calcium phosphate
(Fig. 3c). In neornithines these nanospheres play multiple roles in
the survival of the developing embryo (e.g., Fig. 3d), including
critical antimicrobial defense21,22. Although most modern birds
lack nanospheres in their cuticle, nanostructuring has been
hypothesized to represent the ancestral avian condition21 (Fig. 5).
This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of nanospheres in
the cuticle preserved in Avimaia (Fig. 3c). Similar nanospheres
most commonly occur in modern taxa that nest in humid,
infection-prone environments (e.g., nests near water, or buried21);
therefore, we hypothesize a similar nesting ecology for Avimaia.
This also corroborates data from preserved enantiornithine nests,
which
suggests
the
eggs
were
partially
buried53.
Future
biomolecular analyses, such as investigation of the eggshell pig-
ment, may allow further insights into the nesting ecology of
Avimaia54,55.
Because IVPP V25371 represents a gravid female bird, we
anticipated the presence of MB, a labile tissue that forms endo-
steally in cancellous spaces throughout the skeleton in ovulating
and gravid female birds, providing a calcium reservoir for eggshell
formation3,5 (Fig. 4). MB was first reported outside Neornithes in
the non-avian theropod Tyrannosaurus rex, indicating this
reproductive specialization evolved far outside of Aves4,8 (Fig. 5).
Since this discovery, MB—or MB-like tissues—have been repor-
ted in an even broader phylogenetic sample, including orni-
thischian dinosaurs and pterosaurs56,57. However, because MB-
like endosteal tissues can form for a number of reasons not
necessarily related to reproduction (e.g., ref. 58), no previous
report of fossil MB can claim to be unequivocal within the fra-
mework of our current understanding of this reproductive tis-
sue57. Among stem birds, MB has previously been reported in the
fossil bird Confuciusornis59 and a pengornithid enantiornithine,
both from the Jehol Biota57. The purported MB in Confuciusornis
does not hold up to scrutiny and the pengornithid, although a
very strong case is made, lacks irrefutable signs of reproductive
activity (see discussion in ref.
57). IVPP V25371 preserves
unequivocal evidence of reproductive activity and lacks indication
of bone pathology (i.e., it has a smooth periosteum). Therefore,
Avimaia IVPP V25371 provides the strongest evidence to date for
MB occurring outside crown birds (Fig. 5).
In modern birds, MB is usually woven4,8 or parallel-fibered60,
but it can also present a lamellar organization61. Information
from this specimen and a previously described enantiornithine57
suggests that MB may have formed more slowly in enantior-
nithines compared to similarly sized neornithines. This is

Fig. 5 Simplified phylogeny with hypothetical evolutionary stages of modern avian reproduction. Stage 1: Plesiomorphic dinosaurian condition: abnormal
multilayered eggshells due to egg retention can occur34, dinosauroid eggshell microstructure35, possible sexual dimorphism75, strong histological evidence
for sexual maturity occurring prior to skeletal maturity63. Stage 2: Possible appearance of medullary bone4,8. Stage 3: Possible appearance of ornithoid
eggshell microstructure35. Stage 4: Possible appearance of cuticular nanostructuring21. Stage 5: Strong evidence for sexual dimorphism (inferred sexually
dimorphic feathers, e.g., ref. 65). Stage 6: In Avimaia: presence (not necessarily first occurrence) of cuticular nanostructuring, medullary bone, and a
plesiomorphic non-avian dinosaur-like timing of sexual maturity within Aves. Further support for the presence of sexually dimorphic plumage. Stage 7:
Avian-like timing of sexual maturity, skeletal maturity occurs prior to sexual maturity (probably evolved multiple times in parallel in Ornithuromorpha64)

 consistent with CB deposition, which is slower in enantior-
nithines compared to crown birds62. The MB in Avimaia appears
to have formed more slowly than that reported in another Early
Cretaceous enantiornithine57, which likely represents intraspecific
variation. The femoral histology indicates IVPP V25371 was not
rapidly growing but also that it had not fully reached skeletal
maturity at the time of death. This provides further evidence in
support of hypotheses that non-ornithurine birds, like non-avian
dinosaurs but unlike extant birds, reached reproductive maturity
before somatic maturity59,63–65 (Fig. 5). This has been demon-
strated in non-avian dinosaurs based on specimens preserved
while brooding66. Although widely speculated to also be true in
non-ornithurine birds (and in some cases supported by purported
occurrences of MB)56,59, this specimen provides additional evi-
dence that reproductive maturity preceded skeletal maturity in
stem birds.
Lastly, the holotype of Avimaia appears to lack elongated tail
feathers (Fig. 1), which lends support to inferences regarding the
sexual dimorphism of elongate tail feathers in enantiornithines
(Fig. 5). Some specimens of confuciusornithiforms and enan-
tiornithines preserve elongate rachis-dominated tail feathers
(RDFs), which are widely considered to be sexually dimorphic
features and present only in males65,67. Support for this inter-
pretation comes from the purported preservation of ovarian fol-
licles in one enantiornithine6,7 and medullary bone in one
Confuciusornis59, but the identification of female specific tissue in
both cases is still controversial57,68. Consistent with preserved
indicators that IVPP V25371 is female (egg, MB), RDFs are
absent. It is possible the absence of RDFs in IVPP V25371 is
preservational (as is the case in all described specimens lacking
this feature), given that feathers are not well preserved in this
specimen. An absence due to seasonal differences in plumage is
unlikely—if these feathers are in fact a sexual characteristic, they
would be expected to be present either year-round (as suggested
by their presence in very young juveniles69) or only present in the
breeding plumage. Since IVPP V25371 was clearly breeding, the
absence of RDFs in this specimen is most likely either a true
absence or taphonomic artifact. If this is a true absence,
the holotype of Avimaia then also supports previous hypotheses
that such features are sexually dimorphic and only present in
male enantiornithines67.
Methods
Phylogenetic analysis. We explored the phylogenetic position of IVPP V25371
(Supplementary Figure 4) using an expanded version of the O’Connor and Zhou70
dataset15 that includes seven additional tarsometatarsal characters (Supplementary
Note 1) and revised cranial scorings for Ichthyornis based on recently published
data71. We included all previously described enantiornithines from the Xiagou
Formation: Qiliania, Feitianius, Dunhuangia, GSGM CAGS-IG-07-CM-001,
CAGS-IG-02-0901, CAGS-04-CM-023. Information from CAGS-04-CM-007 was
combined with IVPP V25371 for the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) Avimaia.
CAGS-04-CM-02372 had to be removed because inclusion of this specimen
resulted in the collapse of Ornithothoraces. The final matrix consists of 41 taxa,
25 of which are enantiornithines, scored across 252 characters, 31 of which are
ordered, which we analyzed using TNT73. Early avian evolution is extremely
homoplastic; thus, we explored the effects on the matrix of using implied weighting
at various k values (k = 1, 3, 12, 16)74. We found that the results using a priori
weights were identical to those using implied weighting with the recommended k
value of 1674. Lower k values created a slightly larger polytomy among derived
enantiornithines.
In the presented analysis we conducted a heuristic search using tree-bisection
reconnection (TBR) retaining the single shortest tree from every 1000 followed by a
second round of TBR. The first round produced two trees 709 steps long; a second
round of TBR produced 44 trees of the same length.
Surface area calculations. The surface area occupied by the flattened egg was
calculated using a scaled photograph into the software Illustrator CS6 and the area-
length plug-in.
Paleohistology—petrographic ground-sections. The two fragments (from the
eggshell and the femur, Supplementary Figure 2) were extracted with a rotating tool
equipped with a diamond blade (Dremel 8100). Subsequently, the fragments were
prepared using the paleohistological ground-sectioning technique: Samples were
embedded in EXAKT Technovit 7200 (Norderstedt, Germany) one-component
resin, and cured for 24 h, cut using an EXAKT 300CP accurate circular saw, and
then ground and polished using the EXAKT 400CS grinding system (Norderstedt,
Germany) until the desired optical contrast was reached (between 20 and 30 μm).
Sections were observed under both natural and elliptically polarized light using a
ZEISS AX10 light microscope (Thornwood, USA). Photographs were taken using
the camera ZEISS AxioCam MRc5 (Thornwood, USA) and the software Axio
Vision SE64 (Rel. 4.9). We used the “photomerge” tool in Adobe Photoshop CS6 to
reconstruct the entire sections.
SEM and EDS. SEM was taken at Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences using
FEI Quanta 450 (FEG) at 20 kv. For the fossil egg, petrographic ground-sections
were used, but for the extant comparison of the Japanese quail cuticle (Coturnix
japonica; Fig. 3d), we used a fragment of eggshell embedded in a polished, resin
block (EXAKT Technovit 7200 (Norderstedt, Germany). The Japanese quail egg
fragment was taken from a complete egg obtained commercially. This species was
specifically chosen for its cuticle morphology (with nanostructures of calcium
phosphate) based on two previous studies21,22. Both BSE and SE modes (back-
scattered electrons and secondary electrons) were applied and EDS was calculated
for several spots (Supplementary Figure 5) showing different structures (Supple-
mentary Note 2, Supplementary Figs. 5–11, Supplementary Table 1).
μComputed tomography. The egg of IVPP V25371 was scanned twice. The
longitudinal scan (with a resolution of 15.49 μm) (Fig. 2b; Supplementary Fig-
ure 2b) was obtained from a 160-Micro-CL (Computed Laminography) at the
IVPP (Beijing China). The cross-sectional CT scans (15.7 μm) (Supplementary
Figure 2c) were obtained from an industrial CT scanner Phoenix v|tome|x
(Shanghai, China). CT scans were observed and photographs were taken using the
software VGSTUDIO MAX (2.0).
