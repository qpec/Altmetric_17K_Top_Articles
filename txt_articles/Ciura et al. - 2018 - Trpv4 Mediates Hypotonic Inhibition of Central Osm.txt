In Brief
Ciura et al. show that osmosensory
neurons in organum vasculosum lamina
terminalis are inhibited by hypotonicity.
This effect is triggered by activation of
Trpv4 channels and Ca2+ accumulation in
astrocytes, causing these cells to release
taurine through anion channels. Taurine
inhibits firing by activating glycine
receptors on the osmosensory neurons.

SUMMARY
The maintenance of hydromineral homeostasis re-
quires bidirectional detection of changes in extra-
cellular fluid osmolality by primary osmosensory
neurons (ONs) in the organum vasculosum laminae
terminalis (OVLT). Hypertonicity excites ONs in
part through the mechanical activation of a variant
transient
receptor
potential
vanilloid-1
channel
(dn-Trpv1). However, the mechanism by which local
hypotonicity inhibits ONs in the OVLT remains un-
known. Here, we show that hypotonicity can reduce
the basal activity of dn-Trpv1 channels and hyperpo-
larize acutely isolated ONs. Surprisingly, we found
that mice lacking dn-Trpv1 maintain normal inhibi-
tory responses to hypotonicity when tested in situ.
In the intact setting, hypotonicity inhibits ONs
through a non-cell-autonomous mechanism that
involves glial release of the glycine receptor agonist
taurine through hypotonicity activated anion chan-
nels (HAAC) that are activated subsequent to Ca2+
influx through Trpv4 channels. Our study clarifies
how Trpv4 channels contribute to the inhibition of
OVLT ONs during hypotonicity in situ.
INTRODUCTION
Mammals oppose changes in extracellular fluid (ECF) osmolality
by adjusting adaptive behavioral and physiological mechanisms
such as thirst (Gizowski and Bourque, 2018; Gizowski et al.,
2016; Zimmerman et al., 2017; Zimmerman et al., 2016) and an-
tidiuretic hormone release (Bourque, 2008; Gizowski et al., 2017;
McKinley et al., 2006). Central osmosensory neurons (ONs) in
the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis (OVLT) play an
essential role in this process through their ability to monitor
ECF osmolality and regulate downstream homeostatic effector
neurons. Notably, electrophysiological recordings in vivo and
in vitro have shown that rodent ONs display spontaneous action
potential (AP) discharge under isotonic conditions (Chaudhry
et al., 1989; Vivas et al., 1990), and the rate of this activity rises
during hypertonicity to synaptically excite effector neurons
(Ciura
and
Bourque,
2006;
Trudel
and
Bourque,
2010).
Conversely, hypotonic conditions reduce AP firing rate in ONs
(Vivas et al., 1990), and this effect lowers the excitatory drive
onto downstream neurons (Richard and Bourque, 1995).
While mechanisms mediating hypertonicity-sensing have
received considerable attention, little is known of how OVLT
ONs detect local hypotonicity. Hypertonic conditions depolarize
and excite ONs through the mechanical activation of dn-Trpv1
channels during cell shrinking (Ciura and Bourque, 2006; Ciura
et al., 2011; Zaelzer et al., 2015). Therefore, in principle, hypo-
tonic conditions could inhibit ONs through a swelling-dependent
reduction of dn-Trpv1 activity and membrane hyperpolarization.
Alternately the inhibitory effect of reducing ECF osmolality could
be mediated by the hypotonicity-activated cation channel Trpv4
(Liedtke and Friedman, 2003; Mizuno et al., 2003). While ex-
pressed in the OVLT, Trpv4 channels do not contribute to the
intrinsic osmosensitivity of ONs (Ciura et al., 2011). However,
recent studies have shown that such channels are required for
the regulatory volume decrease (RVD) response of astrocytes
(Benfenati et al., 2011). RVD is a homeostatic process that allows
many types of cells to oppose swelling by extruding solutes such
as taurine. Taurine release in response to swelling can occur
through various subtypes of hypotonicity-activated anion chan-
nels (HAACs) (Hoffmann et al., 2015; Jentsch, 2016; Vaisey et al.,
2016). Since taurine is an agonist at glycine receptors (GlyRs)
(Choe et al., 2012; Hussy et al., 1997), we examined whether
the hypotonic inhibition of OVLT neurons could be mediated by
HAAC-dependent gliotransmission and GlyR activation.
RESULTS
Hypotonicity Deactivates dn-Trpv1 in ONs
To determine whether deactivation of basally active dn�Trpv1
channels can mediate cell-autonomous hypotonicity sensing,
we examined the effects of applying a hypotonic solution to
neurons acutely isolated from the OVLT of wild-type (WT) and
Trpv1 knockout (Trpv1�/�) mice. Current-voltage (I-V) analysis

 revealed that hypotonicity caused a significant decrease in
membrane conductance in WT ONs (from 0.356 ± 0.041 to
0.272 ± 0.037 ns; n = 32; p < 0.001) but not cells from Trpv1�/�
mice (from 0.329 ± 0.040 to 0.311 ± 0.039 ns; n = 32; p = 0.131;
paired t tests; Figures 1A and 1B). Moreover, the effect of hypo-
tonicity observed in WT neurons was inhibited by the Trpv1
blocker SB366791 (3 mM; Figures 1A and 1B). Analysis of vari-
ance confirmed that the decrease in membrane conductance
caused by hypotonic stimulation of WT ONs was significantly
greater than either WT neurons exposed to SB366791 or ONs
from Trpv1�/� mice (p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA on rank and
Dunn’s post hoc comparison). Therefore, lowering extracellular
tonicity can cause a significant deactivation of basally active
dn-Trpv1 channels and should generate a relative outward shift
in holding current at voltages near rest to cause hyperpolar-
ization. Indeed, hypotonic solutions caused an outward shift in
current at a holding voltage (VH) of �60 mV in ONs isolated
from WT mice (WT 19.74 ± 4.38 pA, n = 32, p < 0.001), but not
Trpv1�/� mice (0.03 ± 3.0 pA, n = 32, p = 0.994; paired t tests).
dn-Trpv1 Is Not Required for Hypotonicity Detection In
Situ
To determine whether the cell-autonomous deactivation of
dn-Trpv1 is required for hypotonic inhibition of ONs in situ, we
performed non-invasive extracellular single-unit recordings in
acute hypothalamic explants prepared from WT and Trpv1�/�
mice, a preparation that preserves the cellular architecture and
synaptic connectivity of the entire OVLT. Surprisingly, we found
that hypotonic solutions inhibited the firing rate (FR) of ONs in
both genotypes (Figure 1C). Moreover, linear regression analysis
revealed that the slope of the relation between osmolality and the
firing rate was equivalent for neurons recorded in explants from
WT (0.043 ± 0.004 Hz/mOsm, r2 = 0.579, n = 43) and Trpv1�/�
mice (0.049 ± 0.004 Hz/mOsm, r2 = 0.767, n = 19; p > 0.05; Fig-
ure 1D). Thus mechanisms other than the deactivation of basally
active dn�Trpv1 channels contribute to the functional inhibition
of ONs during hypotonic conditions in situ.
Hypotonicity Inhibits ONs via Taurine Release and GlyR
Activation
In situ hybridization analysis has shown that the gene coding for
the taurine transporter (Slc6a6) is highly expressed in mouse
OVLT (Mouse brain atlas; http://www.alleninstitute.org/). Indeed,
as illustrated in Figure 2A (and Figure S1), the OVLT was strongly
labeled with an anti-taurine antibody. Furthermore, we found
dense GlyR immunolabeling in the processes and somata of
OVLT neurons (Figure 2B). To determine whether taurine can
inhibit ONs, we performed extracellular recordings from OVLT
neurons in acute slices of adult mouse hypothalamus. Bath
application of taurine (1 mM) caused a significant inhibition of
the firing rate in ONs (from 3.43 ± 0.63 Hz to 1.25 ± 0.65 Hz,
n = 5, p = 0.018), and this effect was abolished by the selective
GlyR antagonist strychnine (1 mM; from 3.60 ± 1.29 Hz to
2.98 ± 1.33 Hz, n = 3; p = 0.810, one-way repeated measures
[RM] ANOVA and Tukey test; Figures 2C and 2D).
To determine whether hypotonicity causes taurine to be
released in the vicinity of ONs, we next analyzed taurine efflux
from microdissected OVLTs. For this purpose, perfusate was
collected during consecutive 3-min time intervals, and samples
were analyzed using high-pressure liquid chromatography
(HPLC). As shown in Figure 2E, the average taurine concentra-
tion of samples taken during the hypotonic stimulus (22.9 ±
4.0 nM; n = 15 samples) was significantly greater than baseline
(5.7 ± 0.9 nM, n = 15 samples; p = 0.01, Mann-Whitney test),
thereby identifying taurine as a candidate mediator of ON inhibi-
tion during hypotonicity. We next investigated whether this
endogenously released taurine could be inhibiting ONs via the
activation of GlyRs. These experiments were performed in
superfused explants prepared from Trpv1�/� mice to exclude
any possible contribution of dn-Trpv1 deactivation. As illustrated
in Figure 2F, the inhibitory effect of hypotonicity was not pre-
vented by synaptic blockade with 10 mM bicuculline and 3 mM
kynurenate, suggesting that synaptic afferents are not required

 for hypotonicity-induced inhibition. However, the effect of hypo-
tonicity was completely suppressed by strychnine, indicating
that hypotonic conditions can inhibit ONs via release of endoge-
nous taurine and activation of GlyRs.
Hypotonicity Causes Taurine Release via HAACs in Glial
Cells
Taurine release under hypotonic conditions can be mediated by
various types of HAACs, including channels that can be blocked
by DCPIB (4-[(2-Butyl-6,7-dichloro-2-cyclopentyl-2,3-dihydro-
1-oxo-1H-inden-5-yl)oxy]butanoic acid; 20 mM) (Decher et al.,
2001; Hoffmann et al., 2015; Jentsch, 2016). As illustrated in
Figures 3A and 3B, the decrease in electrical activity induced
in ONs by hypotonic solution was blocked when explants from
Trpv1�/� mice were perfused with solution containing DCPIB
(from 3.49 ± 0.91 Hz in control to 3.47 ± 1.10 Hz in hypotonic,
n = 12, p = 0.927; paired t test).
In principle, neuronal and glial cells could both contribute to
hypotonicity-induced taurine release in the OVLT. However, pre-
vious work has shown that ONs behave as steady-state osmom-
eters and fail to show volume regulation in response to physio-
logically relevant osmotic stimuli (Ciura et al., 2011; Zhang and
Bourque, 2003). Therefore, taurine may be selectively released
by glial cells in the OVLT. To test this hypothesis, we compared
the effects of DCPIB on hypotonicity-induced currents in
cultured cortical glial cells and in ONs acutely isolated from the
OVLT of Trpv1�/� mice. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings
(e.g., Figure 3C) revealed that glial cells display a large increase
in membrane anion conductance when exposed to hypotonic
solution (control 1.56 ± 0.35 ns; hypotonic 9.10 ± 1.96 ns,
n = 7, p = 0.007; paired t test; Figure 3D; see Experimental Pro-
cedures for details), whereas ONs from Trpv1�/� mice showed
no significant change (control 1.54 ± 0.69 ns, hypotonic 1.54 ±
0.58 ns, n = 5, p = 0.982; Figure 3E). Moreover, addition of
20 mM DCPIB to the bath had no effect on ONs (p = 0.450) but
significantly reduced the response of glial cells, whose mem-
brane conductance returned to a value not significantly different
than control (3.11 ± 0.35 ns, n = 7, p = 0.345, one-way RM
ANOVA; Figure 3D).
To test the hypothesis that glial cells selectively mediate the
HAAC- and GlyR- dependent inhibition of ONs in situ, we exam-
ined the effects of treating hypothalamic explants prepared from

 Trpv1�/� mice with fluorocitrate (FC, 50 mM), a glia-selective
metabolic toxin (Imamura et al., 1993; Paulsen et al., 1987).
As shown in Figure 3A, ONs in FC-treated explants failed to
show an inhibitory response to hypotonic stimulation (control
3.05 ± 0.62 Hz, hypotonic 3.00 ± 0.58 Hz, n = 12, p = 0.606),
yet neurons recorded from FC-treated preparations showed
normal AP firing and inhibitory responses to GlyR activation
(Figure S2). Therefore, hypotonicity sensing by ONs in situ is
mediated by HAAC-dependent release of taurine from surround-
ing glial cells.
Trpv4 Mediates Hypotonicity-Induced Calcium Influx in
Glia
Hypotonic stimuli have been shown to increase [Ca2+]i in
astrocytes (Pangrsic et al., 2006), and hypotonicity-induced
activation of HAACs in these cells requires Ca2+ influx and
accumulation (Li et al., 2002). While the mechanism by which
hypotonicity increases [Ca2+]i is poorly understood, previous
work has shown that the hypotonicity-activated and Ca2+-
permeable cation channel Trpv4 is highly expressed in the

OVLT
(Liedtke
and
Friedman,
2003).
Indeed, immunostaining of the OVLT
with an antibody directed against Trpv4
revealed intense staining that was co-
localized
with
the
astrocytic
marker
GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein; Fig-
ures 4A and S3).
To determine whether Trpv4 contrib-
utes to hypotonicity-mediated increases
in [Ca2+]i, we performed measurements
on
cultured
WT
astrocytes
loaded
with FURA-2. Analysis of the ratio of
fluorescence emission (510 nm) evoked
by excitation at 340 and 380 nm (F340/380)
confirmed that hypotonic solutions signif-
icantly increase [Ca2+]i (control 0.369 ±
0.009 versus hypo 0.559 ± 0.031, n = 112 cells in 11 experiments,
p < 0.001,Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Figures 4B–D). The average
increase in [Ca2+]i observed in this total population of cells was
highly significant despite the fact that many cells seemed
unresponsive to the stimulus. Assuming that an increase in
F340/380 >0.2 indicates responsiveness (2 times the SD of all basal
F340/380 values), we determined that 31.3% of WT astrocytes
were responsive to hypotonic stimulation. Although astrocytes
obtained from Trvp4 knockout (Trpv4�/�) mice also displayed
a hypotonicity-induced increase in average [Ca2+]i (F340/380 ;
control 0.382 ± 0.017 versus hypo 0.476 ± 0.032, n = 36 cells
in 4 experiments, p < 0.001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), the hy-
potonicity-induced increase in F340/380 was significantly smaller
in Trpv4�/� cells than in WT cells (p = 0.002; Mann-Whitney
test; Figure 4D). Moreover a significantly smaller proportion of
Trpv4�/� astrocytes was responsive to hypotonicity compared
to WT cells (13.9% versus 31.3%, p = 0.041, chi-square test).
Further support for the involvement of Trpv4 in hypotonicity-
mediated increases in [Ca2+]i was obtained by examining the
effects of acute blockade of TRPV4 in WT cells. As illustrated in

HC-067047 significantly and reversibly reduced the increase in

Trpv4-Driven Ca2+ Influx Mediates HAAC Activation and
Gliotransmission
To determine whether the increase in [Ca2+]i is required for HAAC
activation during hypotonicity, we examined the effects of
chelating intracellular Ca2+ with BAPTA (1,2-bis(o-aminophe-
noxy)ethane-N,N,N0,N0-tetraacetic acid) during whole-cell re-
cordings from glial cells. As shown in Figures 4F and 4G, the
increase in membrane conductance (DG) evoked by hypotonic
solution was completely abolished in cells recorded using
BAPTA-filled pipettes (control 20.05 ± 3.37 ns, n = 18; BAPTA
0.49 ± 0.58 ns, n = 8; p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA). Moreover,
compared to controls, the increase in conductance evoked by
hypotonicity was significantly reduced in WT cells treated with
HC-067047 (5.04 ± 3.0, n = 7, p = 0.005) and astrocytes obtained
from Trpv4�/� mice (6.05 ± 1.34 ns, n = 15, p < 0.001; one-way
ANOVA; Figures 4F and 4G). These results indicate that the
Trpv4-mediated Ca2+ influx is required for activation of glial
HAACs in response to a hypotonic stimulus.
We next examined whether Trpv4 channels are required to
mediate the inhibitory effect of hypotonicity on OVLT ONs
in situ. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the effects
of the small molecule Trpv4 activator GSK1016790A (GSK)
(Thorneloe et al., 2008). When tested in artificial cerebrospinal
fluid (ACSF), bath application of GSK (200 nM) caused a signif-
icant inhibition of AP firing recorded extracellularly from OVLT
ONs (control 3.7 ± 0.6 Hz versus GSK 3.2 ± 0.6 Hz; n = 12;
p < 0.05, paired t test), but this inhibitory effect was absent
when GSK was applied in the presence of either DCPIB
or strychnine (Figure S4A). We then compared the effects
hypotonic solution on the electrical activity of ONs in hypotha-
lamic explants prepared from Trpv1�/� and Trpv1/4�/� double-
knockout mice. As illustrated in Figures 4H and 4I, the inhibi-
tory effect of hypotonicity was abolished in explants prepared
from Trpv1/4�/� animals (control 4.45 ± 0.62 Hz, hypotonic
4.39 ± 0.66 Hz, n = 17, p = 0.820, paired t test). Taken
together,
these
data
indicate
that hypotonicity
activates
Trpv4 channels to induce DCPIB- and GlyR-mediated inhibi-
tion of ONs in situ.
DISCUSSION
The brain’s ability to detect ECF hypotonicity is essential for the
maintenance of fluid homeostasis (Bourque, 2008) and to pre-
vent life threatening conditions such as hyponatremia and water
toxicity (Ayus et al., 2000; Hoorn and Zietse, 2008). Previous
work has shown that hypotonicity inhibits osmoregulatory
effector neurons such as vasopressin-releasing neurons in the
supraoptic nucleus through a combination of reduced excitatory
synaptic drive from OVLT ONs (Richard and Bourque, 1995) and
inhibitory gliotransmission (Choe et al., 2012; Hussy et al., 1997).
However, the OVLT is the brain’s primary site for central osmo-
sensation and the mechanisms mediating hypotonicity-depen-
dent inhibition in this nucleus were hitherto unknown. Our results
show that OVLT ONs can detect hypotonicity via cell-autono-
mous deactivation of basally active dn-Trpv1 cation channels
(Zaelzer et al., 2015). In principle, the membrane hyperpolar-
ization resulting from this effect could suffice to mediate hypoto-
nicity detection in situ. However, unexpectedly we found that
the hypotonic inhibition of AP firing by ONs in hypothalamic ex-
plants from Trpv1�/� mice was quantitatively equivalent to that
observed in WT mice. Therefore, other non-cell-autonomous
mechanisms are involved in hypotonicity detection.
It has been hypothesized that local interneurons expressing
Trpv4 could become excited by hypotonicity and mediate the
inhibition of OVLT ONs through a synaptic mechanism (Mizuno
et al., 2003). However, the inhibitory effect of hypotonicity on
OVLT ONs in Trpv1�/� explants was unaffected by combined
blockade of ionotropic GABA and glutamate receptors. There-
fore, local synaptic connections from GABA and glutamate
neurons do not mediate this response. Instead, we found that
the hypotonic inhibition of ONs requires strychnine-sensitive
GlyRs. Although GlyRs are expressed broadly within the brain,
glycinergic synapses occur mainly in the spinal cord and are
generally absent in forebrain regions (Kuhse et al., 1995). Indeed,
spontaneous synaptic events recorded from OVLT ONs are
completely eliminated by blockade of ionotropic GABA and
glutamate receptors (E. Trudel and C.W.B., unpublished data).
Thus, GlyR-mediated inhibition of ONs during hypotonicity likely
occurs at non-synaptic loci.
Previous studies have shown that glial cells can accumulate
large quantities of taurine (30–50 mM) (Olson and Li, 2000;
Pasantes-Morales et al., 1993) that can be released to mediate
RVD under hypotonic conditions (Pasantes-Morales et al.,

 2000). Indeed, taurine was highly concentrated within glial cells
of the OVLT, and HPLC analysis revealed that hypotonicity can
increase the rate at which taurine is released for at least
15 min. Although it is difficult to estimate the concentration of
taurine achieved within subcompartments of extracellular space,
it is reasonable to assume that millimolar levels of taurine would
accumulate in the extracellular compartment to achieve RVD
upon opening of volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs),
and thus that local GlyRs would be exposed to levels sufficient
for activation [EC50 �0.4 mM (Hussy et al., 1997)]. Moreover
the inhibitory effect of hypotonicity on ONs in explants prepared
from Trpv1�/� mice was abolished by pretreatment with the
gliotoxin FC. Taken together, these observations indicate that
taurine is released by glial cells during hypotonicity to inhibit
OVLT ONs via non-synaptic GlyRs.
At least two families of genes can form anion channels that
could potentially open in response to an increase in intracellular
[Ca2+]. These are the bestrophins (e.g., BEST1) and members of
the TMEM16 family (Hoffmann et al., 2015; Kunzelmann, 2015;
Sirianant et al., 2016). While capable of assisting swelling-
induced RVD, these channels are not considered likely media-
tors of taurine efflux due to their selectivity for small anions
(Jentsch, 2016). Nevertheless, TMEM16F has been shown to
become non-selective at high levels of intracellular Ca2+ (Kunzel-
mann, 2015). It is therefore possible that a channel of this type
could mediate taurine release in the OVLT. Alternately, channels
encoded by SWELL1 (LRRC8A) have been shown to form
DCPIB-sensitive and swelling-activated anion channels capable
of fluxing large solutes including taurine (Qiu et al., 2014; Voss
et al., 2014). While the permeation and pharmacological proper-
ties of SWELL1 channels are consistent with the mechanism
defined in our study, the activation of these channels during
hypotonicity was shown to be mediated by a reduction of cyto-
plasmic ionic strength rather than an increase in intracellular
Ca2+ (Syeda et al., 2016). Therefore, additional work is required
to identify the HAAC channel in glial cells of the OVLT.
Although it is well established that Trpv4 is expressed in the
OVLT, and is required for appropriate osmoregulation in vivo
(Liedtke and Friedman, 2003), the specific role played by these
channels in the osmotic control of ONs has remained obscure.
In particular, the hypotonicity-activated phenotype of the Trpv4
channel is paradoxically opposite to the osmotic electrorespon-
siveness of native ONs. Our data reconcile these observations
and explain how dn-Trpv1 and Trpv4 can both participate in a
coherent osmotic regulation of ONs. First, our data show that
the deactivation of basally active dn-Trpv1 channels mediates
an intrinsic hyperpolarizing (i.e., inhibitory) influence on ONs
exposed to hypotonicity. Second, they reveal that Trpv4 and
HAACs expressed in glial cells are partners in a non-cell-auton-
omous mechanism that also promotes the inhibition of ONs dur-
ing hypotonicity. As depicted in Figure S4, our findings indicate
that Trpv4-mediated Ca2+ influx either enables or triggers the
hypotonicity-mediated activation of HAACs in glial cells. More-
over, the resulting release of taurine, and possibly other GlyR
agonists (e.g., alanine and glycine), exerts a powerful inhibitory
effect on the firing rate ONs under hypotonic conditions.
The mixture of osmolytes released by glial cells undergoing
RVD varies with brain region and physiological state. For
example, astrocyte swelling has been shown to promote
VRAC-dependent release of excitatory amino acids and thereby
promote excitotoxicity during ischemia in the cerebral cortex
(Kimelberg, 2005). Whether glial cells mediate pathogenic re-
sponses or adaptive physiological effects, such as those
observed in the OVLT, may be related to specific genetic pro-
grams expressed by the astrocytes that populate different brain
regions (Farmer et al., 2016). Alternately, it is possible that
different physiological states can influence the expression or
activity of transporters that establish the pools of osmolytes
that are available for release upon swelling. Whether genetic
backgrounds or physiological states can modulate taurinergic
gliotransmission within the OVLT remains to be determined.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Transgenic Mice
All experiments were in accordance with a protocol approved by the Facility
Animal Care Committee of McGill University (#1190), using mice on a C57/
Bl6 background housed under 12:12-hr-light conditions and with food and wa-
ter provided ad libitum. WT C57Bl6 mice were from Charles River Laboratory
(QC, Canada), Trpv1�/� mice were from Jackson Laboratory (ME, USA), and
Trpv4�/� animals (Liedtke and Friedman, 2003) were bred in house. Double-
knockout Trpv1/4�/� mice were generated in our facility. Except where indi-
cated, male mice were used at 6–8 weeks of age and were anesthetized
with isoflurane.
Whole-Cell Recordings from Acutely Isolated OVLT Neurons
Whole-cell recordings from OVLT neurons were performed as described pre-
viously (Ciura and Bourque, 2006; Ciura et al., 2011). Further details are in the
Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Extracellular Recordings in Hypothalamic Explants and Slices
Extracellular recordings of APs (0.8–1.5 kHz) were made as described previ-
ously (Ciura and Bourque, 2006). Further details are in the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
Taurine Release from Isolated OVLT
Measurements of taurine release were performed as in previous studies (Choe
et al., 2012; Olson and Li, 2000). Further details are in the Supplemental Exper-
imental Procedures.
Recording and Calcium Imaging of Cultured Glia
Primary glial cultures were prepared as previously described (Duseja et al.,
2015). Prior to recording, cells were incubated with Trypsin (Invitrogen) and
re-plated onto 30-mm Petri dishes. Further details concerning electrophysio-
logical recording and calcium imaging in glia are in the Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures.
Drugs and Chemicals
Detailed information g the drugs used in this study are provided in the Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunostaining experiments, including pre-absorption controls, were per-
formed on coronal OVLT sections (50 mM thick) obtained from the brains of
mice perfused with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde. Further details
are in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Statistics
Statistical comparisons were performed using Sigmaplot 12 (SPSS, Chicago,
IL). All values are reported as mean ± SEM. In each case, normality of data dis-
tribution was assessed, and group comparisons were made as appropriate us-
ing parametric or non-parametric tests: t test, paired t test, Mann-Whitney test,

 or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Where multiple groups were compared, an
ANOVA on ranks was performed followed by Dunn’s test for multiple
comparisons. Slopes of linear regressions were compared using Prism 4.03
(GraphPad). Differences in proportions were tested using the chi-square
method. In all cases, differences were considered significant when p < 0.05.
