Abstract
A widespread approach to modern cancer therapy is to identify a single oncogenic driver gene and 
target its mutant protein product (e.g. EGFR inhibitor treatment in EGFR-mutant lung cancers). 
However, genetically-driven resistance to targeted therapy limits patient survival. Through 
genomic analysis of 1122 EGFR-mutant lung cancer cell-free DNA samples and whole exome 
analysis of seven longitudinally collected tumor samples from an EGFR-mutant lung cancer 
patient, we identify critical co-occurring oncogenic events present in most advanced-stage EGFR-
mutant lung cancers. We define new pathways limiting EGFR inhibitor response, including WNT/
β-catenin and cell cycle gene (e.g. CDK4, CDK6) alterations. Tumor genomic complexity 
increases with EGFR inhibitor treatment and co-occurring alterations in CTNNB1, and PIK3CA 
exhibit non-redundant functions that cooperatively promote tumor metastasis or limit EGFR 
inhibitor response. This study challenges the prevailing single-gene driver oncogene view and 
links clinical outcomes to co-occurring genetic alterations in advanced-stage EGFR-mutant lung 
cancer patients.
Introduction
The current paradigm in cancer genetics and therapy is to view and treat oncogene-positive 
disease (e.g. EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer; NSCLC) primarily through the lens 
of one oncogenic alteration (e.g. oncogenic, mutant EGFR, see Supplementary note). This 
approach does not address the potential risk of co-occurring genetic alterations present in the 
cancer, treating one “driver” as mutually exclusive from any other. Despite limited and 
sporadic reports1–5, the prevalence of co-occurring genetic alterations that impact clinical 
outcomes in advanced-stage lung cancers with a primary oncogenic driver is largely 
unknown, although recent work suggests a potential role for TP53 mutations6,7. This lack of 
data on the prevalence and impact of multiple co-occurring genetic events exists not only for 
treatment-naïve cancers but also for cancers that have acquired resistance to the initial 
targeted therapy (e.g. cancers with EGFR p.Thr790Met). An open question in the field is to 
what extent co-occurring genetic alterations cooperate with a primary driver gene (e.g. 
mutant EGFR) to promote tumor progression and therapy resistance in both the targeted 
therapy-naïve and acquired resistance settings (see Supplementary note).
This knowledge gap exists because to date large-scale genome sequencing efforts in NSCLC 
contain mostly early-stage tumors8, leading to the current prevailing model of one driver 
oncogene in each individual cancer. Yet, early-stage patients are not treated with targeted 
therapy. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that co-occurring genetic alterations 
commonly exist and cooperate with the primary driver as co-drivers to promote tumor 
progression and limit targeted therapy response. Here, we link clinical outcomes to genetic 
co-alterations in the largest cohort of advanced-stage EGFR-mutant lung cancers profiled by 
multiplex sequencing to date.

 Results
cfDNA analysis of advanced EGFR-mutant lung cancers
To determine the prevalence of co-occurring genetic alterations in advanced-stage EGFR-
mutant patients, we undertook a large-scale analysis using a clinically-validated cell free 
(cf)DNA assay Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, Methods). This cfDNA exome platform is 
approved for clinical use and measures single-nucleotide variants, small insertions/deletions, 
gene rearrangements/fusions, and copy number gain (CNG) across 68 clinically-relevant 
cancer genes (Supplementary Table 2, Methods)9,10. We defined the landscape of somatic 
genetic alterations present in 1122 EGFR mutation-positive and 1008 EGFR mutation-
negative patients with advanced-stage (Stage III/IV) NSCLC (Supplementary Tables 3–4, 
and Datasets 1 and 2).
We filtered for mutations that were non-synonymous and validated or predicted to impact 
gene function (Methods), yielding 1122 EGFR-mutation-positive and 944 EGFR mutation-
negative cases. This dataset of advanced-stage EGFR-mutant patients differs from TCGA 
and other genomic compendia of lung cancer that contain largely early-stage tumors.
Analysis of the 1122 EGFR-mutant patient cohort revealed the widespread presence of co-
occurring genetic alterations, in addition to the EGFR driver mutation (Fig. 1a). The EGFR-
mutant cases contained a mean of 2.58 ± 1.7 (S.E.M) genetic alterations beyond EGFR (out 
of the 68 genes profiled). When including the EGFR mutation, the range of detectable 
alterations was 1–13. Most patients (92.9%, 1043/1122) harbored at least one additional 
variant of known or likely functional significance beyond the EGFR driver mutation 
(Supplementary Dataset 1). The majority (89.8%; 3033/3375) of the genetic co-mutations 
present in the EGFR mutation-positive cohort have verified or likely functional impact (by in 
silico modeling, Methods, Supplementary DataSet 1), with only 10.2% (345/3375) of these 
co-mutations classified as likely passenger events (neutral or unknown functional impact). 
16.1% (415/2578) of the mutations present in the EGFR mutation-negative cohort were 
classified as passenger events (P = 1.3E−11, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test, OR: 0.64, 
proportions test, Supplementary Dataset 2; comparing the prevalence of mutations classified 
as passenger events in the EGFR mutation-positive cohort versus the EGFR-mutation-
negative cohort) (Fig. 1a–b, Supplementary Table 3). The data show that canonical EGFR 
driver mutations co-occur with oncogenic driver alterations in several other genes, including 
PIK3CA, BRAF, MET, MYC, CDK6, and CTNNB1. Comparison of the frequency of 
genetic co-alterations present in the EGFR mutation-positive samples (n=1122) with those 
present in the stage-matched EGFR mutation-negative samples (n=944) revealed significant 
enrichment for certain genetic events (q-values determined by two-tailed Fisher’s exact test 
Benjamini-Hocheberg correction for multiple hypotheses) within the EGFR-mutant cancers 
(Supplementary Table 3). There was enrichment for co-alterations in CTNNB1 [frequency 
of alteration in EGFR mutation-positive cases, 5.3% (60/1122) vs. EGFR mutation-negative 
cases, 1.8% (17/944), q = 2.0E−04], CDK6 [frequency of alteration in EGFR mutation-
positive cases 7.0% (79/1122) vs. EGFR mutation-negative cases 3.1% (30/944), q = 
8.0E−04], AR [frequency of alteration in EGFR mutation-positive cases, 5.1% (57/1122) vs. 
EGFR mutation-negative cases, 2.6% (25/944), q = 0.02], and a modest difference in TP53

 [frequency of alteration in EGFR mutation-positive cases, 54.6% (613/1122) vs. EGFR 
mutation-negative cases, 50.3% (475/944), q = 0.14] in the EGFR-mutant cohort (n=1122) 
compared to the stage-matched EGFR mutation-negative samples (n=944) (Fig. 1a–d, 
Supplementary Table 3, Supplementary Datasets 1 and 2). Pathway-level analysis showed 
selection for co-alterations in WNT/CTNNB1 [144/1122 vs. 92/944, q = 0.06) and hormone 
signaling genes (59/1122 vs. 29/944, q = 0.04) in the EGFR-mutant cohort, whereas 
alterations in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) (310/1122 vs. 361/944, q = 2.0E−06), MAPK 
pathway genes (e.g. KRAS) (291/1122 vs. 453/944, q = 2.8E−24) and gene fusions (e.g. 
ALK) (48/1122 vs. 67/944, q = 0.02) were enriched in the EGFR mutation-negative cohort 
(Fig. 1e, Supplementary Table 2). This large-scale dataset uncovers a potential role for 
WNT/CTNNB1 and cell cycle gene aberrations in the pathogenesis of advanced-stage 
EGFR-mutant NSCLC.
The EGFR p.Thr790Met mutation arises in over 50% of cases of acquired resistance to first-
generation EGFR TKIs (erlotinib, gefitinib)11, but is rarely detected (~0.5%) before EGFR 
TKI treatment12. In the cohort of 1122 EGFR-mutant NSCLC samples, 440 had a detectable 
alteration in EGFR encoding the p.Thr790Met mutation. Based on the rare detection of 
EGFR p.Thr790Met in EGFR TKI-naïve patients (0.5%)12, it is likely the vast majority of 
these EGFR p.Thr790Met -positive patients were treated previously with a first (or second)-
generation EGFR TKI. Similar to the presumed mutual exclusivity of oncogenic driver 
mutations in treatment-naïve NSCLC, EGFR TKI treatment resistance is considered largely 
a consequence of a single gene alteration, such as that encoding the EGFR 
p.Thr790Met.mutation, which is thought to be sufficient to drive acquired resistance to first-
generation EGFR TKIs in an individual patient11. Using our large clinical cohort (n=440 
EGFR p.Thr790Met positive cases), we tested whether specific genetic co-alterations tended 
to co-occur with EGFR p.Thr790Met, which would suggest a functional role for such co-
altered genes in driving EGFR TKI resistance in cooperation with EGFR p.Thr790Met. We 
found an increase in the mean number of detectable genetic alterations in EGFR 
p.Thr790Met -positive (2.41 ± 1.89 S.E.M.) compared to EGFR p.Thr790Met -negative 
(2.01 ± 1.77 S.E.M) patients (P = 4.5E−04, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test, Supplementary 
Table 4). More frequent alterations in cell cycle (CDK6, 43/440 vs. 36/682, q = 0.08) and 
CCNE1 (39/440 vs. 39/682, q = 0.28) CNGs), WNT pathway (CTNNB1 oncogenic 
mutations, 33/440 vs. 27/682, q = 0.12), hormone signaling (androgen receptor, AR, somatic 
mutations 30/440 vs. 27/682, q = 0.22), and epigenetic (MYC CNG, 47/440 vs. 41/682, q = 
0.08) genes and in KRAS (21/440 vs. 17/682, q = 0.24) and PDGFRA (21/440 vs. 11/682, q 
= 0.06) (CNG and oncogenic mutations) and BRCA1 (31/440 vs. 24/682, q = 0.10), were 
present in the EGFR p.Thr790Met -positive cases (n = 440) compared with the EGFR 
p.Thr790Met -negative cases (n = 682) (q-values determined by two-tailed Fisher’s exact 
test Benjamini-Hocheberg correction for multiple hypotheses, Fig. 2a–e, Supplementary Fig. 
1a–c and Supplementary Table 4). Corresponding differences in cell cycle (106/440 vs. 
117/682, q = 0.07), DNA repair (48/440 vs. 51/682, q = 0.16), epigenetic (62/440 vs. 
68/682, q = 0.16), WNT (68/440 vs. 76/682, q = 0.16), and hormone (30/440 vs. 29/682, q = 
0.18) pathway level changes were also observed (q-values determined by two-tailed Fisher’s 
exact test Benjamini-Hocheberg correction for multiple hypotheses, Fig. 2f). The finding of 
co-occurring oncogenic mutations in KRAS and EGFR is consistent with preclinical

 data13,14. In a subgroup analysis of EGFR p.Cys797Ser mutation-positive cases (n=15), 
which can arise upon acquired resistance to osimertinib (the approved third-generation 
EGFR TKI with activity against EGFR p.Thr790Met15), there were recurrent activating 
alterations in MAPK pathway (including KRAS CNG and oncogenic mutations) and cell 
cycle genes (CDK4, CDK6), and AR CNGs (Supplementary Fig. 1c). These data reveal 
extensive co-occurring alterations in advanced-stage EGFR-mutant NSCLCs, even those 
with EGFR TKI-resistant forms of mutant EGFR (i.e. p.Thr790Met, p.Cys797Ser).
cfDNA linked to clinical outcomes in EGFR-mutant lung cancers
We next examined the landscape of somatic genetic alterations present in a cohort of 
advanced-stage EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients in which longitudinal cfDNA analysis and 
clinical context and treatment response data were available (n=137 samples from 97 patients, 
Fig. 3a, Supplementary Table 5). Somatic mutations were filtered to remove synonymous 
mutations and mutations of unknown significance (Methods). We analyzed samples obtained 
from patients who were TKI-naïve (n=21), progressed on first-line TKI treatment (n=53) 
and progressed on 2nd line therapy (n=26). The number of detectable somatic alterations 
increased with each line of therapy, irrespective of age, gender, or tobacco exposure (pre-
TKI: mean (95% CI) 3.4 (2.2–4.5), PD 1st line: 3.8 (3.2–4.4), PD 2nd line: 5.2 (4.1–6.2), R2 
= 0.064, Slope 0.92, P = 0.01, F = 4.2, DF = 97, One-way ANOVA; (Fig. 3b, Supplementary 
Fig. 2a–c). Enrichment for the EGFR p.Thr790Met encoding mutation occurred at 
progression on first-line EGFR TKI (31/53 vs. 0/21, q = 3.6E−5), as expected based on the 
rare detection (~0.5%) of EGFRT790M before first-generation EGFR TKI treatment12 and 
established incidence of EGFRT790M (55%–65%) at acquired resistance to first-generation 
EGFR TKIs11 (q-values determined by two-tailed Fisher’s exact test Benjamini-Hocheberg 
correction for multiple hypotheses, Fig. 3a,c, Supplementary Dataset 3). Upon progression 
on second-line treatment (EGFR TKI or chemotherapy), there were trends towards selection 
for co-alterations in CCNE1 (5/26 vs. 3/53, q = 0.5), NF1 (6/26 vs. 3/53, q = 0.4), and 
PIK3CA (7/26 vs. 6/53, q = 0.5) (q-values determined by two-tailed Fisher’s exact test 
Benjamini-Hocheberg correction for multiple hypotheses Fig. 3a, 3c, Supplementary Dataset 
3). Alterations in genes involved in TP53 (pre-TKI vs. PD 2nd line; 6/21 vs. 17/26, q = 0.20), 
RTK (PD 1st line vs. PD 2nd line; 10/53 vs. 11/26, q = 0.17), MAPK (PD 1st line vs. PD 2nd 
line; 10/53 vs. 11/26, q = 0.17), Cell Cycle (PD 1st line vs. PD 2nd line; 10/53 vs. 9/26, q = 
0.27), Epigenetic (PD 1st line vs. PD 2nd line; 4/53 vs. 6/26, q = 0.20) and PI3K pathways 
(pre-TKI vs. PD 2nd line; 1/21 vs. 7/26, q = 0.20) were more frequently detected in patients 
with progression on second-line therapy (q-values determined by two-tailed Fisher’s exact 
test Benjamini-Hocheberg correction for multiple hypotheses, Fig. 3d, Supplementary 
Dataset 3).
We investigated detectable differences in cfDNA between EGFR TKI responders vs. non-
responders in 73 samples from 64 patients for whom response to subsequent EGFR TKI 
treatment was known (Supplementary Table 6). The mean number of functional alterations 
detected in cfDNA was lower in patients who responded (n=37, mean 2.7, 95% CI: 2.3–3.1) 
to a subsequent EGFR TKI (of any generation) compared to those who did not respond 
(n=36, mean 5.2, 95% CI: 4.3–6.0) (P = 0.0002, t = 5.4, F = 3.6, df = 71, 95% CI of 
difference in means 1.6–3.4, unpaired, two-tailed t test, Supplementary Fig. 2d, and

OR= 0.124), or APC (0/37 responders vs. 5/36 non-responders, (q = 0.23, 95% CI [ 0 ~ 
1.15 ] OR undefined) alterations were least likely to respond to a subsequent EGFR TKI (q-
values determined by two-tailed Fisher’s exact test Benjamini-Hocheberg correction for 
multiple hypotheses, Supplementary Fig. 3a–b). Patients whose cfDNA harbored CDK4 or 
CDK6 gene alterations (n=7) also exhibited decreased progression-free survival (PFS) (HR: 
13.8, 95% CI [5.1 ~ 36.8], P = 1.4E−11, Cox proportional hazard regression test, 
Supplementary Fig. S3c–d) in response to EGFR TKI treatment compared to patients 
without detectable CDK4/6 alterations (n=66). Pathway level alterations in cell cycle genes 
(1/37 responders vs. 12/36 non-responders, q = 0.006 (95%CI: 95% CI [ 0.0018 ~ 0.613 ] 
and OR = 0.083)), MAPK (3/37 responders vs. 12/36 non-responders, q = 0.03 (95% CI 
[ 0.04 ~ 1.02 ]:and OR = 0.247), PI3K (1/37 responders vs. 9/36 non-responders, q = 0.03 
(95% CI [ 0.0024 ~ 0.867 ]: and OR= 0.11), and WNT (3/37 responders vs. 8/36 non-
responders, q = 0.19 (95% CI [ 0.058 ~ 0.695] and OR = 0.369) also correlated with lack of 
response to EGFR TKI treatment (q-values determined by two-tailed Fisher’s exact test 
Benjamini-Hocheberg correction for multiple hypotheses, Supplementary Fig. 3e). Cell 
cycle (n=12 positive, n=61 negative, HR 2.8, 95% CI [1.4 ~ 5.9], P = 0.004, Cox 
proportional hazard regression test) and MAPK pathway alterations (n=15 positive, n = 58 
negative, HR 1.9, 95% CI [1.0 ~ 3.7], P = 0.04, Cox proportional hazard regression test) 
(Supplementary Fig. 3f–h) were biomarkers of decreased PFS during subsequent EGFR TKI 
treatment. Patients with CDK4/6 alterations (n=7) exhibited decreased overall survival (OS) 
compared to patients without (n=66) (HR: 5.4, 95% CI [1.7 ~ 18.0], P = 0.002, Cox 
proportional hazard regression test, Supplementary Fig. 4). These data suggest selection for 
increased genetic diversity during iterative tumor progression on therapy and identify 
biomarkers of poor response to EGFR TKI treatment (i.e. cell cycle and MAPK pathway 
gene alterations). We observed further evidence for this in a cohort of several individual 
clinical cases of EGFR-mutant NSCLC in which intra-patient longitudinal cfDNA profiling 
was performed (Supplementary Fig. 5).
cfDNA analysis linked to differential osimertinib response
While mechanisms of acquired resistance to the third-generation EGFR TKI osimertinib 
have been well-described14–17, mechanisms of primary resistance have not been well 
characterized. We identified 41 patients who underwent cfDNA analysis prior to treatment 
with osimertinib for whom clinical response, PFS, and OS to subsequent osimertinib 
treatment were known (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Dataset 4). Alterations in 
MET (3/21), NF1 (5/21), CDK4 (3/21), CCNE (3/21), CDK6 (2/21), PIK3CA (6/21) and 
APC (5/21) were only found in patients with primary resistance to osimertinib treatment 
(Fig. 4a–b, Supplementary Dataset 4). Patients with cfDNA alterations in CDK4 or CDK6 
(n=5) exhibited decreased PFS to osimertinib compared to patients without (n=36) 
detectable CDK4/6 alterations (Median PFS 0.7 months (95% CI: 0.7-NR) vs. 11.2 months

 regression test, Fig. 4c–d), although no statistically significant difference in OS was 
observed (Supplementary Fig. 4c). Pathway level alterations in cell cycle genes (0/20 
responders vs. 8/21 non-responders, q = 0.03 (95%CI [ 0 ~ 0.47 ]: and OR undetermined), 
MAPK (1/20 responders vs. 7/21 non-responders, q = 0.15 (95% CI [ 0.0025 ~ 1.146 ]and 
OR=0.126), PI3K (0/20 responders vs. 7/21 non-responders, q = 0.04 (95% CI [0 ~ 0.667 ]: 
and OR undetermined), and WNT (2/21 responders vs. 7/21 non-responders, q = 0.33 (95% 
CI [ 0.023 ~ 1.65 ] and OR = 0.26) were associated with lack of response to osimertinib 
treatment (q-values determined by two-tailed Fisher’s exact test Benjamini-Hocheberg 
correction for multiple hypotheses, Fig. 4e). Decreased PFS to subsequent osimertinib 
treatment was also associated with cell cycle gene alterations (n=33 alt. negative, median 
PFS 11.2, 95% CI: 8.8-NR vs. n=8 alt. positive, median 1.5 months, 95% CI: 0.7-NR, HR 
5.4, 95% CI [2.0 ~ 14.5], P = 0.0002, Cox proportional hazard regression test, Fig. 4f–g), 
with a trend towards a difference in OS (OS 17.1 vs. 4.3 months, HR 1.7, 95% CI [0.6 ~ 
5.2], P = 0.4, Cox proportional hazard regression test, Supplementary Fig. 4d). These data 
highlight potential roles for MAPK, PI3K, and WNT pathway alterations in driving primary 
resistance to osimertinib and uncover cell cycle gene aberrations (specifically in CDK4/6) as 
a clinical biomarker of osimertinib non-response (i.e. primary resistance) in advanced-stage 
EGFR p.Thr790Met -positive NSCLC. Thus, co-occurring genetic alterations may function 
as co-drivers of tumor progression and drug resistance and create genetic diversity that is 
advantageous for cancer evolution.
Longitudinal spatial-temporal genomic profiling
We next leveraged the uncommon opportunity to analyze a NSCLC clinical case by both 
tumor-based whole-exome sequencing (WES) and cfDNA profiling over six years of disease 
progression: from the initial diagnosis of surgically-resectable disease, through metastatic 
progression first in mediastinal lymph nodes, then in lungs, bone, and brain over time, 
during which the patient was treated with erlotinib followed by the third-generation EGFR 
TKI rociletinib18 (Supplementary Fig. 6). Seven tumor specimens (4 lung, 2 bone, 1 lymph 
node), including four obtained at autopsy upon lethal tumor progression on rociletinib, and 
six plasma specimens were analyzed longitudinally.
The WES analysis showed that over 75% of the coding mutational burden was truncal (i.e. 
ubiquitous and clonal) at diagnosis but this decreased to 50–58% at the time of full cancer 
evolution (patient death) via the emergence of subclonal mutations through tumor 
progression and first- and second-line EGFR TKI treatment and resistance (Fig. 5a). The 
genetic-co-alterations present in this patient by longitudinal tumor-based exome sequencing 
are consistent with our cfDNA analysis of the broader cohort of advanced-stage EGFR-
mutant NSCLC (Fig. 1–4), with evidence of cell cycle, WNT, and PI3K pathway alterations. 
Multiple functionally-relevant somatic co-alterations were present in early-stage disease 
(R1), including clonal and truncal EGFR variant p.Glu746_Thr751delinsLeu (c.
2233_2252delinsAATT:chr7:g.55242463_55242482delinsAATT (hg19); NM_005228), 
CTNNB1 variant p.Ser37Phe (c.110C>T, chr3:g.41266113C>T (hg19);NM_001904)19, 
SMAD4 variant p.Leu146*, (c.437T>G, chr18:g.48575677T>G (hg19);NM_005359) and 
RBM10 variant p.Ser10* (c.269C>A, chrX:g.47032594C>A (hg19);NM_005676) as well as 
CDK2NA copy number loss (Fig. 5a–b, Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Datasets

 5 and 6). Acquisition of PRKCA variant p.Asn468Ile (c.1403_1404AC>TA, chr17:g.
64738757-64738758AC>TA (hg19);NM_002737)20 and PIK3CA variant p.Gly106Val (c.
317G>T, chr3:g.178916930G>T (hg19);NM_006218)21, and CNG in the genomic region 
encoding EGFR, CDK6, MET, and BRAF all occurred upon mediastinal lymph node 
metastasis (R2) (Fig. 5a–c, Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Datasets 5 and 6). 
Progression on initial EGFR TKI (erlotinib) occurred with acquisition of the EGFR variant 
Thr790Met (c.2369C>T, chr7:g.55249071C>T (hg19);NM_005228), found in ~60% of 
EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients who progress on first-generation EGFR TKI11, and the 
persistence of additional co-alterations including CTNNB1 variant p.Ser37Phe and PIK3CA 
variant p.Gly106Val. Our data suggest the PIK3CA variant p.Gly106Val arose before both 
EGFR TKI treatment and EGFR variant p.Thr790Met (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 8). 
The data suggest that the EGFR variant p.Thr790Met arose twice in this case in a previously 
unreported instance of independent dual clones, as it was found in metastatic sites that 
harbored PIK3CA variant p.Gly106Val (R3-left lung at erlotinib progression, R4-left lung at 
rociletinib progression, R6-right lung at rociletinib progression) and those that did not (R5-
right rib metastasis, R7-spine metastasis), although despite relatively deep sequencing 
coverage (250–600 fold across the tumor samples) we cannot completely rule-out that a rare 
subclonal common progenitor cell harboring EGFR variant Thr790Met existed in the 
primary tumor (Fig. 5a–c, Supplementary Fig. 8). Additional subclonal genetic co-
alterations, including PIK3CA variant p.His1047Arg (c.3140A>G, chr3:g.178952085A>G 
(hg19);NM_006218) (R5-right rib), RB1 variant p.Arg857His (c.2570G>A, chr13:g.
49050886G>A (hg19);NM_000321) (R4-left lung), CHD4 variant p.His1151Pro (c.
3452A>C, chr12:g.6697477T>G (hg19);NM_001273) (R6-right lung) and TLR4 variant 
p.Arg289Gln (c.866G>A, chr9 g.120475272G>A (hg19);NM_138554) (R5-right rib) arose 
with tumor progression on rociletinib (Fig. 5a–c). The activating PIK3CA variant 
p.Gly106Val21 was not found in all of the post-rociletinib metastatic sites (present in R4, R6; 
absent in R5, R7), demonstrating lesion-specific heterogeneity (Fig. 5a–b). A subclonal 
PIK3CA oncogenic variant p.His1047Arg22 was found in R5 (right rib, post-rociletinib), 
suggesting another instance of parallel evolution in this cancer: two different PIK3CA 
oncogenes (Fig. 5a–c, Supplementary Fig. 8). Although an RB1 variant p.Arg857His was 
detected in R4 (left lung- at rociletinib progression) and RB1 inactivation is associated with 
transition from lung adenocarcinoma to small cell carcinoma upon acquired EGFR TKI 
resistance23,24, there was no evidence of transition to small cell histology in this case 
perhaps due to absence of a somatic TP53 alteration (Supplementary Fig. 6).
While plasma samples for cfDNA analysis were unavailable for the initial clinical events 
(i.e. before erlotinib treatment), coupling serially-acquired cfDNA data (Methods) with 
tumor biopsy-based WES revealed examples of ubiquitous (e.g. EGFR variant p.exon19del, 
CTNNB1 variant p.Ser37Phe) and lesion-restricted (PIK3CA variant p.Gly106Val, RB1 
variant p.Arg857His, TLR4 variant p.Arg289Gln) mutations in the plasma (Fig. 5d). Thus, 
cfDNA analysis integrates multiple metastatic tumor lesions.
Functional significance of co-occurring genomic alteration
Similar to our larger cohort of EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients (Fig. 1–4), this case highlights 
the co-occurrence of genetic alterations within the WNT (CTNNB1 variant p.Ser37Phe),

 PI3K (PIK3CA variant p.Gly106Val), and cell cycle pathways (CDK6 CNG, and CDKN2A 
loss). We hypothesized such co-occurring alterations might function non-redundantly to 
drive tumor metastasis or limit targeted therapy response (See Supplementary note and Fig. 
6).
Clonal analysis of genetic alterations detected in cfDNA
Our data (Fig. 5) suggest that subclonal co-occurring oncogenic driver events can influence 
tumor progression and response to EGFR TKI treatment. To assess whether subclonal events 
are common in advanced-stage EGFR-mutant lung cancers more broadly, we assessed 
whether co-occurring genetic alterations detected in the cfDNA of 1122 advanced-stage 
EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients were clonal or subclonal (see Supplementary note and 
Supplementary Fig. 10). Our method inferred the founder canonical EGFR mutations 
(encoding p.Leu858Arg and p.Glu746_Ala750del) as mostly clonal in the 1122 patient 
advanced-stage EGFR-mutant NSCLC cohort, as expected (respectively: ~86.5%, 332/384; 
~89.7%, 350/390, P = 0.19, Fisher’s exact test. 95% CI of difference in two population 
proportion: −1.3% ~ 7.7%, OR = 0.96). We further found advanced-stage EGFR mutation-
positive NSCLCs are more likely to harbor subclonal genetic alterations than advanced-stage 
EGFR mutation-negative NSCLCs (Fig. 7a, Supplementary Datasets 1 and 2, 36.6% 
(1156/3157) subclonal alterations in EGFR-mutation positive vs. 24.9% (572/2291) 
subclonal events in EGFR-mutation negative cases, (P = 2.2E−16, Fisher’s exact test [95% CI 
of difference in two population proportion: 9.2%~ 14.1%], OR=1.47). Subclonal alterations 
were also more commonly found in the EGFR variant p.Thr790Met-positive samples (Fig. 
7b, Supplementary Dataset 1, 39.7% (604/1519) in EGFR variant p.Thr790Met-positive vs. 
33.3% (586/1760) in EGFR variant p.Thr790Met-negative cases, P = 0.02, Fisher’s exact 
test [95% CI of difference in two population proportion: 3.1% ~ 9.7%], OR 1.19). Relative 
to the clonal founder EGFR mutation, EGFR variant p.Thr790Met was more frequently 
subclonal (~71.1% clonal; 313/440, compared to founder EGFR mutations p.Leu858Arg and 
p.Glu746_Ala750del ~ 95% clonal (as above), P = 2.2E−16, Fisher’s exact test, OR=1.83), a 
finding of clinical relevance given that subclonal EGFR variant p.Thr790Met may be linked 
to inferior clinical response to third-generation EGFR TKI treatment25. The subclonal 
frequency of other common variants is also described (see Supplementary note).
Discussion
This study sheds new light on the genetic basis of oncogenesis and cancer progression by 
revealing that multiple co-occurring oncogenic events are present in the vast majority of 
advanced-stage EGFR-mutant lung cancers. These new data challenge the current view of 
the genetic basis of EGFR-mutant lung cancer as a single-oncogene disease wherein 
oncogenic, mutant EGFR is mutually exclusive from any other oncogene (Fig. 8). Our 
findings highlight the importance of deploying more informed and genomically-empowered 
molecular diagnosis, monitoring, and dynamically-applied rational polytherapy strategies to 
address the clonal and subclonal co-alterations that drive disease progression and drug 
resistance in order to better control this deadly cancer. Our data are reminiscent of recent 
findings in myeloproliferative neoplasms26 and prompt re-examination of the presence and

 clinical impact of co-occurring genetic alterations in other cancer types using large datasets 
such as the one here to enable a powered analysis.
We identify new pathways that promote EGFR-mutant lung cancer progression and limit 
EGFR TKI response. Examples include WNT/β-catenin and cell cycle gene alterations (Fig. 
4–6; see Supplementary note). Overall, the widespread presence, evolution, and clinical 
impact of co-occurring genetic alterations within advanced-stage EGFR-mutant lung cancers 
uncovered here re-shapes the current view of oncogene-positive lung cancer and offers 
future directions for both basic and clinical research that hold promise for improving current 
treatments for this aggressive cancer.
Online Methods
Patients
IRB-approval for the study # 16-19636 was granted by the UCSF IRB on May 13, 2016. Per 
the UCSF IRB the study does not involve human subjects as defined by the federal 
regulations summarized in 45 CFR 46.102(f), and hence does not require further IRB 
oversight, and requirement for informed consent was waived. For EGFR-mutation positive 
and EGFR-mutation negative cohorts selection for inclusion were met if patients had a 
known diagnosis of stage III or Stage IV NSCLC. For EGFR-mutation positive, 1122 
consecutive samples from 1006 patients from March 2015 to April 2016 in whom a non-
synonymous mutation in EGFR of known or predicted functional significance (see below) 
was identified on the Guardant 360 clinical assay were included for analysis. EGFR copy 
number gain by itself was included in the EGFR-mutation negative cohort. The EGFR-
mutant negative cohort consisted of all other advanced staged NSCLC patients from the time 
period of January 2016-April 2016 (1008 samples from 999 patients). Chart review of 
EGFR-mutant Guardant cases from patients at UCSF, UCSD, UC Davis, and University of 
Colorado was carried out by the study investigators to identify patient demographic 
information and to determine when the Guardant 360 assay was sent in relation to the 
patients’ treatment course. Objective response, PFS, and OS to EGFR TKI therapy were 
determined by retrospective chart review for clinical assessment and direct radiographic 
review by study investigators when possible. Composite clinical evaluation that integrated 
clinical and radiographic information was used to identify responders from non-responders. 
(Responder = radiographic and/or clinical improvement by investigator assessment, Non-
responders = radiographic SD or PD (by RECIST 1.1 criteria, or clinical decline, or death 
prior to imaging). The time-to-event outcomes, including progression free survival and 
overall survival were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method.
Cell-Free DNA Analysis
Samples were shipped to a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)-certified, College 
of American Pathologists-accredited laboratory (Guardant Health, Redwood City, 
California). Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) was extracted from whole blood collected in 10mL 
Streck tubes. After double centrifugation, 5ng – 30ng of cfDNA was isolated for digital 
sequencing as previously described9,27. For EGFR-mutant positive NSCLCs, samples were 
run on 68-gene panel or 70-gene panel, but only the 68 genes in common were included in

 this analysis (Supplementary Table 2). Sequencing data was analyzed using the Guardant 
Health clinical analysis bioinformatics pipeline to identify single nucleotide variants (SNVs) 
in 68 genes (150kb panel footprint), CNGs in 16, indels in EGFR and fusions in ALK, RET, 
ROS1, NTRK1, FGFR2, and FGFR39,27. All cell-free DNA fragments, both leukocyte- and 
tumor-derived, were simultaneously sequenced. The variant allele fraction (VAF) was 
calculated as the proportion of cfDNA harboring the variant in a background of wild-type 
cell-free DNA. Reporting thresholds for SNVs, indels, and fusions were 1–2 molecules and 
0.01%–0.04% allelic fraction with 0.2%–0.3% 95% limits of detection and >99.9999% per-
position analytical specificity9,27. To identify CNGs a large training set, probe-level unique 
molecule coverage was normalized for signal saturation, individual probe efficiency, GC 
content, and overall unique molecule throughput and robustly summarized to generate a 
quantitative gene-level unique molecule representation. Relative quantitation was 
determined by comparison of this representation to the inferred diploid baseline on a per-
gene level. Reporting thresholds were based on training set-established decision thresholds 
for both absolute copy number deviation from per-sample diploid baseline and deviation 
from the baseline variation of probe-level normalized signal in the context of background 
variation within each sample’s own diploid baseline. Reporting threshold for CNGs was 
2.12 copies with a 2.24–2.76 gene-specific 95% limits of detection and 100% analytical 
specificity. For clonality analysis, first, the mutational allele frequency (MAF) was 
normalized by copy numbers of the same genes with CNGs and the largest MAF within each 
was selected as the normalized Max-MAF; second, the ratio of the MAF of each mutational 
allele over Maximum-percentage detection (Max-pct) within a case was computed, and the 
probability distribution was plotted using kernel density estimation. To determine the cut-off 
of percentage of normalized MAF as clonal or subclonal of each mutation, we implemented 
aforementioned algorithms to the case with both tumor tissue exome sequencing and cfDNA 
sequencing encoding EGFR p.exon19del, EGFR p.Thr790Met PIK3CA p.Gly106Val, 
CTNNB1 p.Ser37Phe, RB1 p.Arg857His and TLR4 p.Arg289Gln reported in this study 
(Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 10). The value of 0.2 was defined as a robust cutoff for 
subclonal or clonal mutations resulting in 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, as all 
somatic variants identified through this method as subclonal or clonal in cfDNA were also 
correctly identified as subclonal or clonal in patient tumor samples (Supplementary Fig. 10). 
For longitudinal case (Fig. 5d), cell-free DNA was isolated from 1 ml of frozen plasma and 
analyzed as described5,28. Clinical data was collected by review of medical records under an 
IRB-approved protocol (UCSF). Non-synonymous mutations from EGFR-mutant positive 
and negative datasets were further processed using R statistical computing program (version 
3.3). Unknown significant variants were filtered out by using COSMIC (V79), GENIE (see 
URLs) and prediction algorithm see URLs).
Whole-exome sequencing and analysis
Informed consent was obtained from the patient and patient’s family for study of biological 
materials and clinical records obtained from the patient. DNA was extracted from FFPE for 
primary tumor and frozen tumor tissue samples and matched non-tumor tissue using the 
Qiagen Allprep DNA/RNA Mini Kit. The library preparation protocol was based on the 
Agilent SureSelect Library Prep and Capture System (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, 
CA). Quantitation and quality were assessed using the Qubit Flourometer (Thermo Fisher).

 DNA concentration was determined to be greater than 2.5 ng/ul and the overall quantity > 
500ng. By Nanodrop, the 260/280 ratio was greater than 1.7. DNA was resuspended in a low 
TE buffer and sheared (Duty Cycle 5%; Intensity 175; Cycles/Burst: 200; Time: 300s, 
Corvaris S2 Utrasonicator). Bar-coded exome libraries were prepared using the Agilent Sure 
Select V5 library kit per manfucaturer’s specifications. The libraries were run on the 
HiSeq2500.
Alignment
Raw paired end reads (100bp) in FastQ format generated by the Illumina pipeline were 
aligned to the full hg19 genomic assembly obtained from USCS, gencode 14, using bwa 
version 0.7.12. Picard tools version 1.117 was used to sort, remove duplicate reads and 
generate QC statistics. Tumor DNA was sequenced to median depth of 303X (range 114.39–
383.41) and the matched germline DNA to average depth of 231.65.
Exome analysis
SNV, INDEL and Dinucleotide substitution calling, identification and classification of driver 
mutations, somatic copy number aberration calling, subclonal deconstruction and 
phylogenetic tree construction were performed as described29.
Classification of SCNAs
SCNA events were defined as segments called by ASCAT >= 400kb in size that met set 
thresholds. Segments with a combined raw nMinor and nMajor greater than a 1.5 times the 
ASCAT derived ploidy for their specific tumor region were considered SCNA gains. SCNA 
losses had an integer nMinor value of 0 and a combined raw nMinor and nMajor of less than 
1.25 times ploidy for their specific tumor region.
Incorporation of p.Thr790Met mutation into phylogenetic reconstruction
In order to create an accurate subclonal phylogeny it is necessary to remove mutation 
clusters that violate two evolutionary principles. Firstly, the pigeonhole principle which 
ensures that two mutation clusters cannot be considered to be on separate branches of an 
evolutionary tree and thus be independent if the cancer cell fraction values of the two 
clusters together exceeds 100% within region of a tumor. Secondly, a descendent clone must 
have a smaller cancer cell fraction than its ancestor within each and every tumor region, 
referred to as the ‘crossing rule’. Using these principles, it can be determined whether 
particular mutation clusters conflict with each other and cannot be fitted to the same 
evolutionary tree.
The subclonal phylogeny illustrating the entire course of the patient’s disease was derived 
following these two principles and the methods of multi-sample subclonal deconstruction 
and tree construction in29. However, the SNV encoding EGFR p.Thr790Met did not cluster 
with any other SNVs following these methods due to its unique CCF profile across R3, R4, 
R5, R6 and R7. No other SNV appears clonal in all these regions as well as being absent 
from both R1 and R2. As cluster 7 and the EGFR p.Thr790Met encoding mutation appear 
clonal in R3, R4, and R6 but cluster 7 is absent from R5 and R7 and the EGFR p.Thr790Met 
encoding mutation is present they cannot, by the crossing rule, be present in the same

 population of cells. In addition, as cluster 7 was present clonally in R2 before Erlotinib 
treatment while the EGFR p.Thr790Met encoding mutation is absent from R2, it follows that 
cluster 7 is likely to have arisen before the EGFR p.Thr790Met encoding SNV.
The most parsimonious solution to this violation of the crossing rule, assuming that the 
cancer cell fractions are correct, is that there are two independent origins of the EGFR 
p.Thr790Met encoding SNV. p.Thr790Met encoding SNV (A) would occur in a cell already 
containing the SNVs from cluster 7, and go on to become clonal post-Erlotinib treatment in 
R3, R4 and R6. p.Thr790Met encoding SNV (B) would occur in a population of cells 
lacking the SNVs present in cluster 7 and go on to become clonal in R5 and R7 post-
Erlotinib. These possible origins of the EGFR p.Thr790Met encoding SNV are indicated on 
the subclonal phylogeny that can be seen in Supplementary Figure 8 by the placement of a 
magenta square on the relevant branches.
Cell Lines and Reagents—The HCC827 (EGFR p.Glu746_Ala750del) and HEK293-FT 
cell lines were obtained, authenticated, and cultured as recommended by the American Type 
Culture Collection (ATCC). These cell lines confirmed to be negative for mycoplasma. 
HCC827 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 media (Hyclone, GE Healthcare) supplemented 
with 10% FBS (SAFC, Sigma-Aldrich), 1X penicillin and streptomycin (UCSF, Cell Culture 
Facility). HEK293-FT cells were cultured in DMEM media (Hyclone, GE Healthcare), 
supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.1X penicillin and streptomycin. All cell lines were grown at 
37 °C, in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Erlotinib and rociletinib were purchased 
from Selleckchem.

PIK3CA and β-Catenin constructs were engineered to express PIK3CA p.Gly106Val and β-
Catenin p.Ser37Phe following QuickChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit protocol 
(Agilent Technologies). The p.Ser37Phe encoding CTNNB1 fragment was then sub-cloned 
in a pQCXIB retroviral construct for stable overexpression, using sticky ends ligation with 
ApaI and BamHI-HF (New England BioLabs) restriction enzymes, per manufacturer’s 
instructions. HEK293-FT cells were transfected with pBABE (empty vector), pBABE-
PIK3CA encoding p.Gly106Val, pQCXIB (empty vector) and pQCXIB-CTNNB1 encoding 
p.Ser37Phe using Fugene 6 (Promega) per manufacturer’s instructions. Virus containing 
media was harvested at 24 hrs and 48 hrs post-transfection. HCC827 cells were infected 
with virus containing media, supplemented with 8 μg/ml of polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich), for 
24 hours. The culture medium was changed to standard growth media for an over-night 
incubation, after which cells were incubated in antibiotic selecting medium containing 
puromycin 1 ug/mL (Gibco) for p-Babe construct or blasticidin 2.5 ug/mL (Gibco) for 
pQCXIB constructs. Antibiotic resistant cells were used in the subsequent tests.

 Cell Viability and Growth Assays—One hundred thousand of HCC827 cells, 
engineered with the β-Catenin p.Ser37Phe and PIK3CA p.Gly106Val expression constructs, 
and under puromycin (1 ug/mL) and blasticidin (2.5 ug/mL) selection, were seeded in 12 
well plates and, after 24 hrs, treated with DMSO (control), erlotinib (50–100 nM) and 
rociletinib (100 nM), in 2% FBS, for three days. Cells were then air-dried for 5 minutes, 
fixed for 5 miutes in ParaFormAldehyde (PFA, 4% vol/vol; Santa Cruz Biothechnology) and 
stained in 0.05% crystal violet (g/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) solution for 30 minutes. Each well 
was washed twice with tap water and air-dried. Plates were scanned using ImageQuant 
LAS4000 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Each image is representative of a triplicate 
experiment. Cell viability was assessed using the above culture conditions, seeding two 
hundred of cells each well. Cell count was registered after three days of growth and assessed 
using Vi-CELL XR. Each test was run in triplicate.
Invasion and Migration Assays—Transwell migration and invasion assays were 
performed as described in Okimoto et al.35 Briefly, 8-μm-pore Matrigel coated (invasion) or 
non-coated (migration) Transwell inserts (BD Biosciences) were added at the top of a 
Transwell chamber filled with 10% FBS, RPMI media. To each insert, 2.4 × 104 cells in 
serum-free media were added. The Transwell chambers were incubated for 20 hrs at 37 °C 
in the incubator. Cells that did not migrate through the pore or invade the matrigel were 
scraped off; the membranes were fixed in methanol for 15 min and then stained with crystal 
violet for 30 min. The surface of the membrane was imaged in 5 distinct fields, with a Zeiss 
Axioplan II immunofluorescent microscope at 10×. Invasion and migration were assessed 
counting the average imaged cells in the 5 regions. Results presented are from three 
independent experiments.
Immunoblotting and q-RT-PCR—The HCC827 cells engineered with the β-Catenin 
p.Ser37Phe and PIK3CA p.Gly106Val expression constructs were drug treated, in serum free 
condition, with DMSO (control), erlotinib (100 nM) and rociletinib (100 nM) for 24 hrs. 
Protein lysates were collected in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease (Roche) and 
phosphatase (Roche) inhibitors. Western blot was performed loading 10 μg of lysed proteins. 
Pre-casted 4–15% gels (Bio-Rad) were used for the mono-dimension protein separation. 
Proteins were transferred on nitrocellulose membranes using Trans-blot Turbo Transfer 
system (Bio-Rad). Blots were then blocked in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween20 (vol/vol) 
and 5% BSA (Fischer Scientific, vol/vol) for 1 hr, at room temperature. The primary 
antibodies were incubated over-night, at 4ºC. The primary antibodies used were: pY1068-
EGFR D7A5 (#3777), total EGFR D38B1 (#4267), β-Catenin D10A8 (#8480), pS473-AKT 
D9E (#4060), total AKT (#9272), pT202/Y204-ERK1/2 (#9101), total ERK1/2 (#9102) and 
cleaved PARP (#9541) from Cell Signaling Technology; Actin AC-74 (#A2228) from 
Sigma-Aldrich. The membranes were washed twice in washing buffer (Tris-buffered saline, 
0.1% Tween20, vol/vol) and then incubated with secondary HRP conjugated antibodies for 1 
hr, at room temperature. ECL kit (GE Healthcare) was used as chemoluminescent substrate. 
Blots were developed and scanned using ImageQuant LAS4000 (GE Healthcare Life 
Sciences). ImageJ (NIH) was used to quantify the western blots. All western blots represent 
the result of three independent experiments.

 The RNA was purified from the HCC827 cells engineered with the β-Catenin p.Ser37Phe 
and PIK3CA p.Gly106Val expression constructs using RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen). One 
microgram of total RNA was used for the reverse-transcriptase reaction with SensiFAST 
cDNA Synthesis Kit (BIOLINE). The q-PCR was performed with six replicates each 
condition and using a 1:3 dilution of the template cDNA. Human MYC, CCND1, LEF1, 
HOXB9, and endogenous control GAPDH genes were amplified with Taqman gene 
expression assay (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression analysis was computed using 
QuantStudio 12K Flex Software (Applied Biosystems). Data were analyzed using the 2−ΔΔCt 
method and expressed as relative mRNA expression.
Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was performed as described36. Briefly, 
5-micron thick formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) human tissue sections were stained 
with the β-Catenin D10A8 (#8480 Cell Signaling, 1:100 dilution), or pSer473-Akt D9E 
(#4060, Cell Signaling, 1:100 dilution) antibody per manufacturer’s instructions. Stained 
slides were digitized using the Aperio ScanScope CS Slide Scanner (Aperio Technologies) 
with a 20× objective. The proportion of cells exhibiting nuclear β-Catenin staining was 
determined using the ScanScope default nuclear algorithm. pSer473-Akt quantitation was 
determined using the ScanScope default membrane algorithm. Three fields of view per 
section were used to determine the mean and standard error of the mean of positively 
staining cells.
Statistics—To determine differences in cfDNA alterations between cohorts two-tailed 
Fischer’s Exact test with Benjamini-Hochberg method to correct for multiple hypothesis 
testing and generate q-values.was (Figs. 1c,e, 2c,f, 3c,d, 4e, Supplementary Figs. 3 and 9). 
We considered the false discovery rate to be controlled under 20% (q<=0.2).37 For 
supplementary tables 3 and 4, two-tail t-test was used for two population mean difference 
with 95% confidence interval. The effect size, Cohen’s d was determined by the equation: 
(Mean1-Mean2)/SDpooled, where SDpooled= (SD1+SD2)/2; proportions test was used for two 
population proportion comparison with 95% confidence interval, no correction was used. In 
some conditions, 95% confidence interval for the single population proportion was used. 
The odds ratio (OR) was calculated for the measure of effect size between two population 
with proportion comparison. For PFS (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 3) and OS 
(Supplementary Fig. 4) assessments, the 95% CI for median duration of progression free 
survival and overall survival were computed using robust nonparametric Brookmeyer and 
Crowley method. Hazard ratio with 95% CI and P-values were calculated with Cox 
proportional hazards regression model with survival package in R. For Q-PCR, cell growth, 
invasion, and migration analysis (Fig. 6) one-way ANOVA and with Bonferroni correction 
were used to determine P-values (GraphPad Prism).

 Figure 8. Evolution of the understanding of the genetic pathogenesis of oncogene-positive (here, 
EGFR-mutant) lung cancer
(a) Traditional view of lung cancer based on histopathological analysis. Lung 
adenocarcinoma, scale bar = 50 microns. (b) Current molecular classification of NSCLC 
based on single-gene driver oncogene status, depicting the current view of mutually-
exclusive driver oncogenes, as shown in the pie chart with frequency of each driver 
alteration in lung adenocarcinoma. (c) The proposed new model of EGFR-mutant NSCLC 
pathogenesis arising from our findings: a re-classification of advanced-stage EGFR-mutant 
NSCLC based on the co-occurring genetic alterations that our dataset revealed (shown here 
at the pathway level). We propose that advanced-stage EGFR-mutant NSCLCs contain co-
occurring genetic alterations that function collaboratively as co-drivers of tumor progression 
and drug resistance. We now need to identify and co-target these co-occurring functional 
genetic alterations beyond mutant EGFR itself in patients, early and dynamically during 
treatment, in order to improve patient survival. The finding of extensive co-occurring 
alterations within advanced-stage EGFR-mutant NSCLC at scale now paves the way for 
studying the biological and clinical impacts of genetic interactions that are created by the co-
alterations present in these EGFR-mutant NSCLCs.
