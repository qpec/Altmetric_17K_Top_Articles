In light of the current outbreak of Ebola virus disease, there is an urgent need to develop effective therapeutics to treat Ebola infection,
and drug repurposing screening is a potentially rapid approach for identifying such therapeutics. We developed a biosafety level 2
(BSL-2) 1536-well plate assay to screen for entry inhibitors of Ebola virus-like particles (VLPs) containing the glycoprotein (GP) and the
matrix VP40 protein fused to a beta-lactamase reporter protein and applied this assay for a rapid drug repurposing screen of Food and
Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. We report here the identification of 53 drugs with activity of blocking Ebola VLP entry into
cells. These 53 active compounds can be divided into categories including microtubule inhibitors, estrogen receptor modulators,
antihistamines, antipsychotics, pump/channel antagonists, and anticancer/antibiotics. Several of these compounds, including
microtubule inhibitors and estrogen receptor modulators, had previously been reported to be active in BSL-4 infectious Ebola virus
replication assays and in animal model studies. Our assay represents a robust, effective and rapid high-throughput screen for the
identification of lead compounds in drug development for the treatment of Ebola virus infection.

INTRODUCTION
The current outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa has esca-
lated to a scale not seen previously. As the outbreak continues, the
export of virus infections to other regions in the world is occurring,
accompanied in some cases by secondary infections.1 Currently, there
is no proven effective treatment for Ebola virus infection. Although
antibody-based therapy has been shown to be effective in a macaque
model and has been used for the treatment of a few patients, the
current supply of such drugs is very limited.2 The estimated mortality
rate of the current Ebola outbreak is approximately 70%, which is
dramatically high.3 Although a specific vaccine might eventually con-
trol Ebola virus infection, its development and deployment may take
some time.4,5 Therefore, drug repurposing screens that identify
approved drugs with the potential for new indications might be a good
approach to rapidly discover and develop anti-Ebola virus drugs for
the treatment of patients with Ebola virus infection.
We applied a previously developed Ebola virus-like particle (VLP)
entry assay for a drug repurposing screen of Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)-approved drugs.6 The Ebola VLP used in this
assay is comprised of two proteins: glycoprotein (GP) and the matrix
protein VP40 fused to a beta-lactamase reporter enzyme, which can be
used to monitor VLP entry in a regular biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) cell
model. We miniaturized this assay into a 1536-well plate format for
high-throughput screening (HTS). This initial drug repurposing
screen led to the identification of 53 previously approved drugs with
Ebola VLP entry-blocking activity. Although the activities of these
drugs should be further confirmed using fully infectious Ebola viruses
in vitro and in vivo in BSL-4 laboratories, we herein publish all of our
data for quick access by other researchers interested in further studies.
Using the assay described, we plan to conduct more comprehensive
compound screening to identify additional lead compounds for drug
development to treat Ebola virus infection.

 (ATP) content cell viability assay kit was purchased from Promega
(Madison, WI, USA). Polystyrene plates (384-well and 1536-well
black, clear bottom, sterile, tissue culture treated) were purchased
from Greiner Bio-One (Monroe, NC, USA). A FDA-approved drug
collection of 600 compounds was originally prepared at the National
Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) for a persona-
lized cancer treatment project. This collection excludes certain drugs,
such as those known to be immunosuppressive, topically applied drugs,
and those for approved use in animals. In a follow-up screening, we
used an NCATS-approved drug collection of 2816 compounds that was
previously assembled.7 All of the compounds were dissolved as a
10 mM stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted in
DMSO at a 1 : 3 dilution to generate six concentrations in 384-well
plates, followed by reformatting into three 1536-well compound source
plates for HTS.
Cell culture methods
HeLa cells were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS, GE healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and 100 U/mL of penicillin
and 100 mg/mL of streptomycin (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) at 37 6
C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2.
Cell viability assay with the ATP content assay kit
HeLa cells were plated at 750 cells/well in 3 mL of assay medium
(DMEM110% FBS) in 1536-well assay plates and incubated for
16 h at 37 6
C and 5% CO2. Library compounds were added to the
assay plate at 23 nL/well using an NX-TR pintool station (WAKO
Scientific Solutions, San Diego, CA, USA). After a 4.5 h incubation
at 37 6
C and 5% CO2, cytotoxicity effects were measured by adding
3 mL of ATP content assay mixture to each well and incubating the
plates at room temperature for 30 min. Luminescence values were
acquired using a ViewLux plate reader (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA,
USA).
Ebola VLP beta-lactamase assay for HTS in 1536-well plates
This 1536-well plate assay was adapted from the original 6-well assay6
with a modification that eliminated the cell washing steps. HeLa cells
were plated at 750 cells/well in 3 mL of assay medium (DMEM110%
FBS) in 1536-well assay plates and incubated for 16 h at 37 6
C and 5%
CO2. Compounds in the 1536-well drug source plates were added to
the 1536-well assay plates at a volume of 23 nL/well using an NX-TR
pintool station (WAKO Scientific Solutions, San Diego, CA, USA).
Following a 1 h incubation at 37 6
C with 5% CO2, 1 mL/well of VLP
solution was added to the assay plates using a BioRapTR FRD dispenser
(the VLP solution was diluted in Opti-MEM to a final con-
centration of 1: 16). The plates were then spinoculated by centrifu-
gation at 1500 rpm at 4 6
C for 45 min, followed by incubation at
37 6
C with 5% CO2 for 4.5 h. The CCF2-AM beta-lactamase substrate
was prepared at a 63 concentration following the manufacturer’s
instructions and added to the assay plates at 1 mL/well. Following a
2 h incubation at room temperature, dual fluorescence intensities
(Ex15405620, Em15460620, and Ex25405620, Em25530620 nm)
were measured using an EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer, Boston,
MA, USA). The ratio of fluorescence intensities (Em1/Em2) was calcu-
lated to represent the beta-lactamase activity that is proportional to the
amount of VLP entry into the host cells.
Imaging measurement of VLP entry assay in 384-well plates
Hits identified in the primary assay were ‘cherry-picked’ and serially
diluted in a 1 : 3 ratio in DMSO to produce 11 concentrations. The
VLP entry assay was then performed in a manner similar to that
described above. Briefly, HeLa cells were plated at 4000 cells/well in
40 mL assay medium (DMEM110% FBS) and incubated for 16 h at
37 6
C with 5% CO2. The compounds in DMSO solution were added at
0.5 mL/well to the assay plate; after a 1 h incubation at 37 6
C with 5%
CO2, 10 mL of the VLP inoculum was added to each well (final dilution
of 1 : 16). Following centrifugation at 4 6
C for 45 min, the plates were
incubated for 4.5 h at 37 6
C with 5% CO2. The 63CCF2-AM substrate
solution was added to the assay plates (8.3 mL/well), and a 2 h incuba-
tion at ambient temperature was performed. The dual fluorescence
intensities were measured using an EnVision plate reader as described
above, and fluorescence images (both green and blue) were also
processed using an InCell 2200 automated imaging system (GE
Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA).
Data analysis and statistics
The primary screen data and curve fitting were analyzed using soft-
ware developed internally at the NIH Chemical Genomics Center
(NCGC).8 Half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of
compound confirmation data were calculated using Prism software
(GraphPad Software, Inc. San Diego, CA). All values are expressed as
the mean 6 SD (no3).
RESULTS
Optimization of Ebola VLP entry assay for HTS
Our Ebola VLP entry assay utilizes two Ebola viral structural proteins:
GP and VP40 fused to a beta-lactamase reporter. Upon expression of
these two proteins in transfected 293 T cells, VLPs are produced that
contain BlaVP40 packaged inside a lipid envelope in which GP is
anchored. After incubation in HeLa cells, the VLPs enter the cyto-
plasm through the receptor binding-fusion activity of GP, thus releas-
ing BlaVP40 into the intracellular space. VP40-beta-lactamase is
delivered into the cytoplasm and can be detected by its beta-lactamase
activity inside cells (Figure 1A).6 The Ebola VLPs morphologically
resemble wild-type Ebola viruses.9 The original assay was developed
in a 6-well plate format with multiple plate-washing steps; however, to
perform compound screening with this Ebola VLP entry assay in a
1536-well plate format, we optimized the assay by miniaturization and
reduction of the steps (Figure 1B). We were able to detect a robust
assay signal using 750 cells at 3 mL/well in this 1536-well plate format;
this greatly reduced the need for VLP solution, which is a limiting
reagent for this assay. We were also able to eliminate the washing steps
by using a dye-quenching solution in the beta-lactamase loading buf-
fer. This simplified the assay procedure, reduced well-to-well variation
due to intrinsic errors in the washing steps, and significantly increased
the compound screening throughput. A signal-to-basal ratio of 2.5-
fold with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 11% and a Z9 factor of 0.62
were obtained in a DMSO plate test in this 1536-well plate Ebola virus
entry assay (Figure 1C).
Drug repurposing screen to identify active compounds that block
Ebola VLP entry
We previously selected 600 FDA-approved drugs from our collection
for a cancer project that eliminated certain compounds, including
immunosuppressive drugs. This series of drugs was diluted at a 1 : 3
ratio to generate six concentrations, ranging from 0.24 to 57.5 mM
(final), in the assay plates. We identified 25 primary hits using a criteria

 of IC50,10 mM and a maximal inhibition of .70% in the Ebola VLP
assay. These primary hits were then ‘cherry-picked’ along with three
additional microtubule inhibitors and an human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) entry inhibitor for confirmation testing. We also
performed a data analysis using the green fluorescence channel to
eliminate cytotoxic compounds (the green channel indicates healthy
and viable cells that are loaded with the fluorescent beta-lactamase
substrate).
Among the 29 ‘cherry-picked’ compounds, the anti-Ebola virus
entry activities of 23 were confirmed in the Ebola VLP assay
(Figure 2 and Table 1). To eliminate the effect of cytotoxic com-
pounds, we also measured compound cytotoxicity using an ATP con-
tent assay. The selectivity index (SI) for each active compound is
reported as a ratio of the IC50 of blocking Ebola virus entry over that
determined in the cytotoxicity assay (Tables 1 and 2). The ability of
these compounds to block Ebola VLP entry was also confirmed in
imaging measurements for the same assay (Figure 3). Maraviroc, an
HIV entry inhibitor, was not active in this assay. These 23 confirmed
compounds can be divided into six categories: microtubule inhi-
bitors, estrogen receptor modulators, antihistamines, typical antipsy-
chotics, ion channel/pump antagonists, and anticancer/antibiotics
(Figure 2).
During the submission and revision of this manuscript, we com-
pleted the screening of an additional 2216 drugs in the NCATS-
approved and investigational drug collection.7 The 30 additional
active compounds first listed in Table 2 were selected as having an
IC50,10 mM with a maximal inhibition of .50% and an SI.10 in the
Ebola VLP assay. The last three compounds in Table 2, Imipramine,
Chloroquine, and Nilotinib, have IC50 values between 10 and 30 mM
but have previously been reported to inhibit Ebola virus infection.10–12

Figure 1 Schematic representation of the Ebola VLP entry assay and compound screening method using this assay. (A) Ebola VLPs contain Ebola GP and the VP40
protein fused to a beta-lactamase (Bla) reporter. HeLa cells are loaded with the beta-lactamase substrate CCF2-AM, which results in green fluorescence. After VLP
loading into cells, Bla hydrolyzes the substrate CCF2-AM, disrupting the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in the substrate and thus causing blue
fluorescence. The ratio of blue/green fluorescence intensities represents the activity of Bla inside cells. (B) Flow chart of compound screening in 1536-well plates using

listed in Supplementary Table S1.
DISCUSSION
We quickly applied a BSL-2 Ebola virus entry assay for a repurposing
screen of 600 selected drugs. This assay identifies compounds that block
Ebola VLP entry into host cells mediated by Ebola virus surface GP.
Although the active compounds found to block Ebola VLP entry need
to be further tested in wild-type Ebola virus infection assays and in
animal models to confirm their antiviral activity, our results represent a
proof-of-principle investigation supporting the suitability of this assay
for rapid screening of Ebola antiviral compounds that inhibit viral
entry. Based on our screen of 600 FDA-approved drugs, we quickly
identified 23 compounds that block Ebola VLP entry, with the most
potent compound being the microtubule inhibitor Vinblastine
(IC50548 nM). We also found an additional 30 active FDA-approved
compounds with an IC50,10 mM and SI.10 in the extended screening
of 2216 additional approved or investigational drugs in our collection.
We decided to publish all our data from this drug repurposing screen
so that other researchers may quickly access all the accumulated data in
this ongoing emergency situation caused by the current unprecedented
Ebola virus outbreak. Although our laboratories do not have direct
access to BSL-4 facilities for the further confirmation of the activity
of these compounds in Ebola virus infection assays and animal models,
we hope that our data will be used by other researchers who do possess
the capability of performing these experiments.
The 23 drugs identified with inhibitory effects on Ebola VLP entry
can be grouped into six categories based on their approved indications.
The group with the most potent anti-Ebola virus entry activity consists
of microtubule inhibitors, including Vinblastine (IC50548 nM),
Vinorelbine (IC50566 nM), Vincristine (IC505140 nM), Colchicine
(IC505238 nM), Nocodazole (IC505402 nM), Mebendazole (IC505
3.4 mM), and Albendazole (IC5054.8 mM). Microtubules have prev-
iously been implicated in Ebola virus VP40 and GP functions.13–15
Nocodazole’s activity in blocking Ebola virus entry has been described,
and the mechanism of action is believed to be related to microtubule
depolymerization, leading to the inhibition of viral entry.13
A second group comprises the estrogen receptor modulators
Toremifene (IC5050.56 mM), Tamoxifen (IC5050.73 mM), and
Raloxifene (IC5051.8 mM). A 2013 report indicated that Toremifene
and another estrogen receptor modulator, Clomiphene, effectively
block Ebola virus infection independent of the estrogen receptor
and were effective in a mouse infection model.16 As previously
reported, HeLa cells are estrogen receptor-negative,17–19 and the effect
of estrogen receptor modulators in blocking Ebola virus entry is
believed to be unrelated to the classical estrogen receptors.16 The iden-
tification of estrogen receptor modulators and microtubule inhibitors
in our screen validates the BSL-2 Ebola virus entry assay for the iden-
tification of virus entry inhibitors.
A third group of compounds has antihistamine and anticholinergic
activities and includes Clemastine (IC5051.1 mM), Maprotiline
(IC5052.4 mM), and Benztropine (IC5052.6 mM). A fourth group

 (IC5054.9 mM), Thiothixene (IC5051.9 mM), and Trifluoperazine
(IC5054.4 mM). The possible mechanism of action of these drugs in
inhibiting Ebola VLP entry remains unknown.
A fifth group includes pump/channel blockers such as Digoxin
(IC5050.76 mM), Dronedarone (IC5052.2 mM), and Propafenone
(IC5056.2 mM). The activity of Digoxin has been found in multiple
drug repurposing screens against many targets, including cancer and
HIV.20–22 Digoxin was reported to suppress HIV-1 structural protein
synthesis by altering viral RNA processing23 and to inhibit HIV-1 gene
expression via a-1 subunit of the Na1/K1-ATPase inhibition.20
However, Digoxin shows cytotoxicity at a compound concentration
similar to that effective in blocking Ebola VLP entry. Dronedarone, a
multichannel inhibitor indicated for the treatment of cardiac arrhyth-
mia, inhibits class I sodium (at rapid pacing rates) and class IV calcium
channels and exhibits non-competitive anti-adrenergic activity.10
Propafenone is also an orally active antiarrhythmic drug that blocks
sodium channels and has beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist and weak
calcium antagonist activities.24 The potencies of this group of com-
pounds against Ebola virus entry are relatively weak.
The last four drugs are anticancer drugs and antibiotics. Sunitinib is
a multi-kinase inhibitor.25 Daunomycin, similar to Doxorubicin,
intercalates DNA, inhibiting DNA biosynthesis. DNA intercalators
have also been previously found to induce the production of the anti-
viral cytokine interferon.11 Azithromycin and Clarithromycin are
macrolide antibiotics that block bacterial protein synthesis. It remains
to be determined how these drugs affect Ebola VLP entry.
During the manuscript submission and review process, we screened
an additional 2216 approved drugs from our NCGC pharmaceutical
collection,7 which also contains experimental and animal drugs. We
identified and confirmed 30 additional active compounds selected
using criteria of an IC50,10 mM with a maximal inhibition .50%
and an SI.10-fold in the Ebola virus entry assay (Table 2). Table 2
also shows three additional active compounds previously shown to
inhibit Ebola virus infection.10–12 In addition, we identified 95 active
Table 2 An additional 30 active compounds that block Ebola VLP entry in our assay at an IC50,10 mM and SI .10 plus three additional active
compounds previously shown to inhibit Ebola virus infection.

Approved drugs inhibiting Ebola virus entry into host cells

 compounds with IC50 values of 10 to 30 mM or an SI,10-fold or
without FDA approval for human use (Supplementary Table S1). At
present, we cannot exclude that a few of our reported drugs inhibit
reporter beta-lactamase activity instead of inhibiting Ebola VLP-entry.
Anti-Ebola virus activities of 16 approved drugs that were tested in the
Ebola virus infection assays and/or animal models have been prev-
iously reported in the literature.12,15,16,26–31 We found that 11 of these
16 compounds are active in our Ebola VLP entry assay (Tables 1 and
2): Nocodazole (IC5050.4 mM), Toremifene (0.55 mM), Tamoxifen
(0.76 mM), Raloxifene 1.84 (1.53 mM), Cepharanthine (1.53 mM),
Clomiphene
(1.72 mM),
Dronedarone
(2.2 mM),
Amodiaquine
(4.43 mM), Imipramine (13.7 mM), Chloroquine (15.3 mM), and
Nilotinib (15.3 mM).
Although more experiments will be needed to fully understand the
possible use of any of these compounds against Ebola virus infection,
here we describe a surrogate Ebola virus entry assay that can be used
for HTS in a BSL-2 facility for the rapid screening of extensive com-
pound collections. The identification of several drugs previously
known to inhibit Ebola virus entry in our repurposing screen further
supports the usefulness of our approach. All the screening data
obtained in this Ebola VLP entry assay are deposited in the
PubChem database for open access. Using the Ebola VLP entry assay
described here, we will continue to screen additional experimental
drugs in our collection that are currently in clinical trials, and we
will also expand this compound screening using the entire NCATS
diverse collection of approximately 400 000 compounds. We hope
that our screening efforts will result in the identification of novel
lead compounds for the development of drugs to treat Ebola virus
infections.
