Abstract. Asbestos exposure causes malignant tumors such 
as lung cancer and malignant mesothelioma. Based on our 
hypothesis in which continuous exposure to asbestos of 
immune cells cause reduction of antitumor immunity, the 
decrease of natural killer cell killing activity with reduction 
of NKp46 activating receptor expression, inhibition of cyto-
toxic T cell clonal expansion, reduced CXCR3 chemokine 
receptor expression and production of interferon-γ production 
in CD4+ T cells were reported using cell line models, freshly 
isolated peripheral blood immune cells from health donors as 
well as asbestos exposed patients such as pleural plaque and 
mesothelioma. In addition to these findings, regulatory T cells 
(Treg) showed enhanced function through cell-cell contact 
and increased secretion of typical soluble factors, interleukin 
(IL)-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, in a cell 
line model using the MT-2 human polyclonal T cells and its 
sublines exposed continuously to asbestos fibers. Since these 
sublines showed a remarkable reduction of FoxO1 transcription 
factor, which regulates various cell cycle regulators in asbestos-
exposed sublines, the cell cycle progression in these sublines 
was examined and compared with that of the original MT-2 
cells. Results showed that cyclin D1 expression was markedly 
enhanced, and various cyclin-dependent kinase-inhibitors were 
reduced with increased S phases in the sublines. Furthermore, 
the increase of cyclin D1 expression was regulated by FoxO1. 
The overall findings indicate that antitumor immunity in 
asbestos-exposed individuals may be reduced in Treg through 
changes in the function and volume of Treg.
Introduction
Asbestos exposure causes lung fibrosis known as asbestosis, 
one of the most typical forms of pneumoconiosis, as well 
as pleural plaque (PP), benign pleural effusion, and diffuse 
pleural thickening (1-3). In addition to these benign diseases, 
the occurrence of malignant tumors such as lung cancer and 
malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an important consideration 
for the understanding and development of disease prevention 
methods, early diagnosis and treatment (4-6). The carcino-
genic potential of asbestos fibers has been recognized. Initial 
DNA damage caused by production of reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) mainly derived from iron-including asbestos such as 
crocidolite (CRD) and amosite is considered the dominant 
cause of asbestos-induced carcinogenesis (7,8). Next, physi-
ological DNA damage caused by asbestos fibers to pulmonary 
epithelial cells and pleural mesothelial cells is the other cause 
of malignant transformation because of the rigid and thin 
physical features of fibers with more than a 3 aspect ratio for 
fibers defined as a ‘fiber’ (9,10). In addition to these causes, 
the easy absorbance of other carcinogenic substances inhaled 
into the lung, such as tobacco smoke and air pollutants on the 
surface of asbestos fibers, may enhance the synergistic effects 
for malignant transformation, especially for lung epithelial 
cells, since the odds ratio for lung cancer caused by asbestos 
inhalation and tobacco smoking showed synergistic effects 
according to various epidemiological studies (9-11).
We have been investigating the immunological effects 
of asbestos fibers because asbestos is a mineral silicate 
possessing Si and O as the core chemicals, and silica (SiO2) has 
been shown to affect immune competent cells. The evidence 
of dysregulation of the immune system caused by silica was 
confirmed epidemiologically by frequent complications of 
autoimmune diseases, as well as cell biological investigations 
which revealed chronic activation of responder and regulatory 
T cells (Treg;  CD4+, CD25+ and forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) 
positive inhibitory cells) caused by silica particles (12-14). 
Considering the malignant complications in asbestos-exposed 
patients, it is possible that asbestos exposure promotes the

T cell-like cell line caused by continuous 
exposure to asbestos fibers

reduction of tumor immunity in these patients (15,16). It is 
on the basis of this viewpoint that we examined the effects 
of asbestos on human immune cells. Investigations involving 
human natural killer (NK) cells, a cell line and freshly isolated 
NK cells derived from healthy donors (HD) and stimulated 
ex vivo, showed reduction of NK cell killing activity with 
decreased expression of some NK cell-activating receptors 
such as NKG2D and 2B4, with the suppression of the mitogen-
activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway (17,18). 
In addition, the most remarkable reduction among these acti-
vating receptors was NKp46 when comparing its expression 
to freshly isolated NK cells derived from HD, PP and MM 
patients (17,18). The expression of NKp46 on the surface of 
NK cells was well correlated with NK cell killing activities in 
these patients. Differentiation and clonal expansion of CD8+ 
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were inhibited when chryso-
tile asbestos was co-cultured in a mixed lymphocyte reaction 
(MLR) assay with reduction of cell attacking molecules such 
as granzyme B and perforin (19,20).
Experiments involving T cells have been developed using 
cell line models with continuous exposure to chrysotile A 
(ChA), chrysotile B (ChB) or CRD for more than one year 
in vitro, with cells derived from the human T cell leukemia/
lymphoma (HTLV)-1 virus immortalized human polyclonal 
cell line, MT-2. The original MT-2 cells (Org) showed apop-
tosis with activation of pro-apoptotic MAPK, mitochondrial 
apoptotic pathway and ROS production, when exposed 
transiently to ChA, ChB or CRD with relatively high doses 
of these fibers (21-24). However, when Org cells (MT-2 
cells that never encountered asbestos fibers) were exposed 
continuously with relatively low doses of fibers (doses that 
do not yield apoptosis in less than half of the cells) for more 
than one year, these sublines (designated as CB1 to 3, CA1 to 
3, and CR1 exposed to ChB, ChA and CRD, respectively, and 
established independently) exhibited changes in cell features 
(15,22,24). The cells showed acquisition of asbestos-induced 
apoptosis, alteration of cytokine production, excess produc-
tion of interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor 
(TGF)-β, reduced production of interferon (IFN)-γ, resis-
tance to TGF-β-induced growth inhibition, and enhanced 
phosphorylation and expression of β-actin on their cell 
surface (15,22-25). In addition to these alterations, the cell 
surfaces in these sublines showed reduction of C-X-C motif 
chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3), which is known to be impor-
tant to attract IFN-γ-producing and tumor attacking T cells 
near tumor cells (26-28). Coupled with reduced secretion of 
IFN-γ, these sublines were characterized by reduced anti-
tumor immunity. These findings were confirmed in freshly 
isolated  CD4+ T cells derived from patients with PP or MM 
(26-28). Thus, considering these results and those obtained 
from NK cells and CTLs indicated that asbestos exposure 
causes reduction of antitumor immunity in asbestos-exposed 
individuals.
Since it was reported that MT-2 cells possess Treg func-
tion (29) and exhibit excess production of typical soluble 
factors such as Treg, IL-10 and TGF-β in CB1-3, CA1-3 and 
CR sublines continuously exposed to asbestos fibers such as 
ChB, ChA and CRD (15,22-25), it was thought that asbestos 
exposure of the MT-2 cell line causes enhanced Treg function. 
This possibility was investigated together with the increase in 
Treg function of sublines through cell cell contact, as well as 
the reported excess production of soluble factors (30).
It was also found that sublines continuously exposed to 
asbestos showed remarkably reduced expression of forkhead 
transcriptional factor 1 (FoxO1) (31). We reported that this 
reduced FoxO1 caused reduction of pro-apoptotic molecules 
such as Puma, Bim and Fas ligand in exposed sublines 
(CB1-3, CA1-3 and CR1), in addition to Bcl-2 overexpression 
induced by phosphorylation of signal tranducer and activator 
of transcription 3 (STAT3) caused by autocrine usage of 
overproduced IL-10 (31). FoxO1 is known to regulate various 
cell cycle regulators such as cyclins and cyclin-dependent 
kinase-inhibitors (CDK-Is) (32-36). Therefore, in this study 
we analyzed the expression of these cell cycle regulators and 
the status of cell cycle progression in sublines continuously 
exposed to asbestos, and compared the results with those 
obtained for Org cells.
Materials and methods
Cell lines and asbestos. Details of MT-2, Org and the asbestos-
induced apoptosis resistant sublines (CA1-3, CB1-3 and CR1) 
have been reported previously (22-24). These cells were 
maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37˚C in 
RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum 
(FCS), streptomycin and penicillin. Seven asbestos-resistant 
sublines, CA1-3, CB1-3 and CR1, were generated by continuous 
exposure to ChA, ChB, and CRD, respectively. As previously 
reported (22-24), the doses of asbestos fibers for continuous 
exposure were 5-10 µg/ml. These doses induced less than half 
of the cells to proceed to apoptosis when transiently exposed 
(22-24). The International Union Against Cancer standard 
ChA and ChB were kindly provided by the Department of 
Occupational Health at the National Institute for Occupational 
Health, South Africa. In addition, ChA, ChB and CRD were 
kindly provided as standard fibers from the Japan Association 
for the Study of Fiber Materials. The mineralogical features of 
fibers used have been reported previously (37).
Real-time RT-PCR. The expression levels of various cell cycle 
regulators such as CDK-Is including p21Cip1, p27Kip1, p57Kip2, 
p16ink4a, p15ink4b, p18ink4c, and p19ink4d, and cyclins including 
cyclin A, B, D1, D2 and e, were analyzed in Org and continu-
ously exposed sublines (CA1-3, CB1-3 and CR) using the 
real-time RT-PCR method. All the primers used are listed in 
Table I. Total cellular mRNA from ORG, CA1-3. CB1-3 and 
CR1 cells was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen 
GmbH, Hilden, Germany). After synthesis of the first strand 
of cDNA, real-time RT-PCR was performed using the SYBeR 
Green method (Takara Bio Inc., Kusatsu, Japan) with the 
Mx3000P QPCR System (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa 
Clara, CA, uSA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Western blotting. The procedures for western blotting were 
performed according to the previously reported methods (31). 
Briefly, MT-2Org cells and cells from asbestos continuously 
exposed sublines were lysed in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) 
containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM 2-mercap-
toethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 
0.1% sodium lauryl sulfate, 150 mM NaCl and 1% protease

inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and briefly sonicated. After 
centrifugation at 18,000 x g for 10 min, the supernatant was 
collected and measured using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, 
Rockford, IL, uSA). Cell lysate containing 50 µg protein was 
boiled in SDS-sample buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGe 
separation. The resolved proteins were subsequently elec-
trotransferred onto Immobilon P membranes (Millipore, 
Bedford, MA, uSA). After initial blocking with Tris-buffered 
saline containing 0.2% Tween-20 (TBS-T) supplemented with 
5% BSA for 2 h membranes were then incubated with each 
primary antibody in TBS-T containing 1% BSA at dilutions 
recommended by the manufacturers for 1-2 h at room tempera-
ture (RT). Thereafter, the membrane was gently rinsed with 
TBS-T and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conju-
gated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies in TBS-T 
at dilutions recommended by the manufacturers for 1 h at 
RT. After a final set of rinsing with TBS-T, the presence of 
the proteins of interest was evaluated using a chemilumines-
cence reaction mediated by an ECL Plus chemiluminescence 
detection kit (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) and each 
was then visualized with Chemi-Stage (Toyobo, Osaka, 
Japan).
Western blotting for some of the cell cycle regulators 
was performed using mouse anti p21Cip1 (F-5) (Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology), rabbit anti p16ink4a (C-20) (Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology), rabbit anti-cyclin D1 (M-20) (Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology), and rabbit anti-β-actin as the control (Cell 
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, uSA).
Flow cytometric analysis of the cell cycle. The individual cell 
cycle phases in logarithmically proliferating ORG, CA1-3, 
CB1-3 and CR1 cells were analyzed using flow cytometry. 
For the continuously exposed sublines CA1-3, CB1-3 and 
CR1, supplemented asbestos fibers were removed using 
density gradient centrifugation and cells without fibers were 
then cultured for one week before the analysis. All of these 
sublines and the Org MT-2 cells were cultured with bromode-
oxyuridine (BrdU) for 30 min, and after being washed twice 
with PBS the cells were incubated with fluorescence-labelled 
anti-BrdU antibody and 7-amino-actinomycin D (7AAD) for 
detection of DNA indices. The G1 phase in the cell cycle was 
then determined as BrdU-negative, DNA indices = 2n frac-
tion, the S phase was Brdu-positive, and DNA indices = 2n< 
<4n fraction, while the G2/M phases were Brdu-negative and 
DNA indices = 4n fraction.
Knock-down of FoxO1 in the MT-2Org cell line. Procedures 
regarding knock-down of FoxO1 in MT-2Org with lenti-
virus have been described (31). Lentivirus plasmid vectors 
pLKO.1-puro-Control having scramble shRNA sequence and 
pLKO.1-puro containing shRNA sequence targeting human 
FoxO1 (TRCN0000039579 and TRCN0000039580), and 
the packaging plasmids kit of pLP1, pLP2 and pLP/VSVG, 
were obtained from Sigma and Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, 
uSA), respectively. Recombinant lentivirus was produced 
in Hek293T cells and MT-2Org cells were infected with 
recombinant lentivirus. Sublines having the shRNA expres-
sion cassette with puromycin resistance were established after 
culture with medium containing 1 µg/ml puromycin (Sigma) 
for 2 weeks. Resultant cell lines were designated Org-Ctrl 
(Scramble), Org-kD#1 (TRCN0000039579) or Org-kD#2 
(TRCN0000039580). The amount of FoxO1 protein was 
determined with immunoblot analysis using anti-FoxO1 
monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology).

known to negatively regulate cyclin D1 among the various 
cyclins. In addition, the sublines continuously exposed to 
asbestos (MT-2 Org, CA1-3, CB1-3 and CR1) showed remark-
ably reduced expression of the FoxO1 gene. As expected, 
cyclin D1 expression was remarkably enhanced in all the 
sublines by ~20-60-fold when compared with that of Org cells. 
For other cyclins, expressions of cyclin D2 and E showed no 
differences between Org and sublines. Although cyclins A 
and B showed decreased expression in sublines compared to 
Org cells, the reduction rate was 0.2-0.5-fold in the sublines. 
The excess expression of cyclin D1 in the sublines was a 
remarkable finding among the cyclins examined.
In contrast to results for the cyclins, various CDK-Is exhib-
ited reduced expression in sublines compared to MT-2 Org 
cells. As shown in Fig. 2, p21Cip1, p57Kip2, p18ink4c and 9\p19ink4d 
showed significantly reduced expression in the sublines.
Protein expression of cyclin D1 and CDK-Is. The representa-
tive protein expression of p21Cip1, p16ink4a and cyclin D1 are 
shown in Fig. 3. Similar to findings for mRNA expression, 
cyclin D1 was expressed highly in sublines when compared 
to that in MT-2 Org cells. In addition, expressions of p21Cip1 
and p16ink4a were reduced in the sublines. Although p16ink4a 
mRNA was not representative because of the lower quality of 
real-time RT-PCR, it was clear that the expression of p16ink4a 
decreased remarkably in sublines at the protein level.
Cell cycle phases in MT-2Org and sublines continuously 
exposed to asbestos fibers. As shown in Fig. 4A, cell cycle 
phases in MT-2 Org cells and the seven sublines continuously 
exposed to asbestos fibers (CA1-3, CB1-3 and CR1) were 
analyzed using staining with anti-Brdu antibody and DNA 
indices using 7AAD. The percentages of the S phase (cells with 
Brdu-positive and 2n< <4n in DNA indices) were then divided 
by the percentage of the G1 phase (cells with BrdU-negative 
and 2n in DNA indices). The results for all cell lines and MT-2 
Org are shown in Fig. 4B, and S/G1 phase-population ratios 
are relative to a ratio of 1.0 for MT-2 Org. All sublines showed 
a higher ratio ranging from 2.6 to 4.3. This indicated that the 
cell cycle in sublines had progressed rapidly compared to that

of MT-2 Org cells, as suggested from the data of cell cycle 
regulator expression, the remarkable excess expression of 
cyclin D1, and the reduced expression of CDK-Is.
Cyclin D1 expression in MT-2 Org knocked down forcibly by 
FoxO1. The sublines of MT-2 Org, which were continuously 
exposed to asbestos fibers, showed a remarkably decreased 
expression of FoxO1 as we reported previously. In addition, 
cyclin D1, which is negatively regulated by FoxO1, showed 
recovered expression in the sublines, and a similar pattern was 
observed for CDK-Is, which are positively regulated by FoxO1 
and showed reduced expression in the sublines. To confirm the 
direct effects of reduced FoxO1 in MT-2 Org for the expres-
sion of cyclin D1, lentivirus-derived shRNA for FoxO1 was

induced in MT-2Org, and the expression of cyclin D1 in MT-2 
Org and the knocked-down subline was analyzed. As shown 
in Fig. 5A, two of the knocked-down cells (kD#1 and kD#2) 
showed reduced expression of FoxO1. Additionally, the mRNA 
expression of cyclin D1 was assayed using kD#1 cells and 
scrambled sequence transfected cells. Although the expression 
level in kD#1 was not enhanced remarkably, as we observed in 
sublines continuously exposed to asbestos fibers for more than 
one year, the expression of cyclin D1 was significantly upregu-
lated in kD#1 compared to that in scrambled transfected cells.
Discussion
Asbestos-exposed patients show complications comprising 
malignant tumors such as lung cancer and malignant meso-
thelioma (4-6). In addition, these individuals might have an 
increased risk of developing other tumors such as laryngeal, 
gastrointestinal and bladder cancers (38,39). Pulmonary 
regions are also affected by carcinogenic activities such as 
ROS production, physical impairment of cellular DNA due to 
the mineralogical features of the asbestos fibers, and absorp-
tion of other carcinogenic substances inhaled into the lung, all 
of which may lead to the development of malignant tumors. 
However, a consideration of other cancers and the long latent 
period (30-50 years) for pulmonary and pleural occurrence of 
cancers suggest that reduction of antitumor immunity may be 
an important factor in the development of asbestos-induced 
tumors (4-6). It is from this viewpoint that we have been 
investigating the immunological effects of asbestos fibers on 
immune competent cells. Our results showed that NK cells 
exhibited reduced killing activity and expression of various 
activating receptors, as well as a decrease of MAPK signaling 
in experiments involving an asbestos-exposed human NK cell 
line, freshly isolated NK cells exposed to asbestos in vitro, and

in NK cells derived from asbestos-exposed patients with PP or 
MM (17,18). CTLs showed reduced differentiation and clonal 
expansion when CD8+ T cells were put into the MLR assay 
with reduction of cell attacking molecules such as granzyme B 
and perforin (19,20). Investigation of T helper cells showed 
that CXCR3 expression and IFN-γ production were reduced 
in trials involving the cell line model, freshly isolated cells 
from HD and continuously exposed to asbestos in vitro, and in 
CD4+ cells derived from patients with PP or MM (15,26,27).
The other immune cell that plays an important role in anti-
tumor immunity is Treg. If the function and volume of Treg are 
enhanced, the activity of tumor-killing T cells is suppressed, 
particularly in the area surrounding tumor cells, and antitumor 
immunity is subsequently reduced (40-42). To investigate the 
possibility of enhanced Treg function following its continuous 
exposure to asbestos, we investigated Treg function using MT-2 
cells, which were reported to possess Treg function (29,30). 
Our findings indicated that MT-2 cells exposed continuously 
to asbestos with a relatively low dose did not exhibit apoptosis 
when exposed transiently, showed enhancement of Treg func-
tion via cell-cell contact, and revealed an increase of soluble 
factors to function as Treg, namely, IL-10 and TGF-β, as we 
reported previously (22,24,30).
The next goal was to determine how asbestos alters cell 
proliferation or cell cycle progression in Treg. A key fact for 
this investigation was the remarkably reduced expression of 
FoxO1 transcription factor found in MT-2 sublines exposed 
continuously to asbestos fibers such as ChA, ChB, and CRD. 
These sublines showed resistance against the asbestos-induced 
apoptosis via upregulation of IL-10, increased phosphorylation 
of STAT3 by autocrine usage of IL-10, and subsequent upregu-
lation of Bcl-2 located downstream of STAT3 (22). Moreover, 
our recent study revealed that reduced FoxO1 caused reduction 
of other apoptosis-related molecules such as Bim, Puma, and 
Fas ligand, which are known to be regulated by FoxO1 (31).
FoxO1 is known to regulate various cell cycle regulators, 
such as cyclin D1 and CDk-Is. Since cyclin D1 is negatively 
regulated and CDK-Is are positively regulated, it seems that 
FoxO1 control of the cell cycle does not proceed quickly. 
However, if continuous asbestos exposure causes massive 
downregulation of FoxO1, the cell proliferating activity 
might be accelerated in such cells. Therefore, the expres-
sion of cell cycle regulators in MT-2 Org and its sublines 
was examined. Results showed an overall tendency toward 
acceleration of cell cycle progression, since cyclin D1 was 
highly expressed, CDK-Is showed reduced expression, and 
the S phase in sublines increased in comparison to MT-2 Org 
cells. The increased expression of cyclin D1 was regulated by 
FoxO1, since artificially silenced cells from MT-2 Org showed 
increased cyclin D1 expression.
A consideration of the overall results and our previous 
findings reveals that MT-2 sublines continuously exposed to 
asbestos fibers such as ChA, ChB and CRD showed enhanced 
Treg function via cell-cell contact and excess secretion of 
typical two soluble factors, namely, IL-10 and TGF-β, and 
examination of Treg in the asbestos-exposed population may 
reflect enhancement of function and proliferation, quality and 
volume (Fig. 6). However, it is difficult to examine these facts 
in asbestos-exposed patients because the function and volume 
of Treg needs to be analyzed in the tumor-surrounding area

Figure 6. Schematic summary of the effects on Treg following continuous 
exposure to asbestos fibers, the ‘enhancement of Treg function’. The func-
tion of Treg was enhanced through cell-cell contact and excess production 
of typical soluble factors such as IL-10 and TGF-β. In addition to these func-
tional enhancements, the volume of Treg may increase following asbestos 
exposure through the remarkable reduction of the FoxO1 transcription factor. 
Both effects of asbestos exposure on Treg reduces antitumor immunity in 
asbestos-exposed individuals.

instead of peripheral blood. This evaluation therefore needs 
time. Notwithstanding these considerations, our cell line model 
clearly showed that asbestos causes a reduction of antitumor 
immunity in asbestos-exposed individuals and makes them 
more sensitive to the development of tumors after a long-term 
latent period following the initial exposure to asbestos.
Future studies are needed to evaluate Treg function and 
volume in the surrounding areas of asbestos-induced tumors, 
and to develop preventive procedures to neutralize asbestos-
induced enhancement of Treg through the use of natural 
products in foods or plants. These approaches may be helpful 
for chemoprevention of asbestos-induced tumorigenesis.
