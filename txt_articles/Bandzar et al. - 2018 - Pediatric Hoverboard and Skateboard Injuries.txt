OBJECTIVES: To investigate the characteristics of hoverboard injuries compared with 
skateboard injuries in children presenting to US emergency departments (EDs).
METHODS: Data regarding hoverboard and skateboard injuries in children <18 years of age 
were obtained from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System for calendar years 
2015 and 2016. Data included demographics, body regions injured, and ED disposition.
RESULTS: There were an estimated 26 854 hoverboard and 121 398 skateboard injuries 
treated in US EDs between 2015 and 2016. The mean and median ages for hoverboard 
and skateboard injuries were 11 and 13 years, respectively. In both groups, boys were 
more commonly injured. The majority of hoverboard injuries occurred at home, whereas 
skateboard injuries occurred on the street. The wrists were the most common injured 
body part, and fractures were the most common diagnosis in both groups. The majority 
of patients in both groups were discharged from the hospital. Approximately 3% of the 
patients with skateboard injuries and hoverboard injuries were admitted to the hospital.
CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of injuries among hoverboard riders and skateboarders 
was similar. Fractures, contusions, and sprains and/or strains were the most common 
types of injuries in both riders. However, there was a higher number of sprains and/or 
strains in skateboarders when compared with hoverboard users. This difference may be 
attributed to the way users ride these boards. Fractures were the most common reason for 
hospital admission for both toys. By elucidating the characteristics of hoverboard injuries, 
preventive measures can be implemented to decrease the incidence of these injuries as well 
as ED visits.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Hoverboards 
are a new toy among children. Hoverboards are 
known to spontaneously catch fire and cause a wide 
array of injuries. However, little research has been 
conducted regarding hoverboard injuries and how to 
counsel parents appropriately.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: In this study, we use 
nationally representative data to investigate 
various characteristics of hoverboard injuries and 
skateboard injuries in children to better counsel 
parents. We highlight the importance of helmet use, 
wrist pad use, and parental supervision.

Downloaded from 
 Hoverboards (also known as self-
balancing, 2-wheeled boards) 
have experienced rapid popularity 
since their introduction to the US 
consumer market in 2015. As the 
demand for hoverboards spiked that 
year, US consumers were able to 
purchase hoverboards from multiple 
manufacturers that did not undergo 
quality or safety inspections before 
sale.1 By the last quarter of 2015, the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission 
(CPSC) had received reports of users 
with dangerous injuries presenting 
to emergency departments (EDs), 
including burns from spontaneous 
fires from malfunctioning hoverboard 
batteries, as detailed in the press.2 As 
a result, the CPSC began investigating 
hoverboard injuries, and many 
airlines, university campuses, and 
public roads banned hoverboard use.3
Hoverboards, which are structurally 
similar to skateboards, have attracted 
media attention, but little research 
has been conducted to investigate 
hoverboard injuries. Researchers 
in recent studies have investigated 
skateboard injuries in children and 
suggested preventive measures 
to increase patient safety.4 The 
CPSC’s National Electronic Injury 
Surveillance System (NEISS) database 
contains a wealth of information 
regarding users with various injuries 
related to consumer products (ie, 
hoverboard injuries) who present 
to US hospital EDs across the nation. 
Our purpose in this study is to use the 
nationally representative data from 
the NEISS database to investigate the 
characteristics and epidemiology of 
hoverboard injuries in the pediatric 
population and compare them with 
those of skateboard injuries. We aim 
to elucidate the types of injuries that 
occur to help direct injury prevention 
efforts and advise families.
METHODS
Data Source
The CPSC monitors injuries in US 
EDs through the NEISS database. 
The NEISS database, which was 
established in calendar year 1972, 
has undergone various revisions 
in its sampling frame during 1978, 
1990, and 1997 and is a stratified 
sample of ∼100 hospital EDs in the 
United States. The data in the NEISS 
are selected from hospitals with at 
least 6 beds and that operate for 24 
hours per day in the United States 
and its territories. Hospitals that 
participate in the NEISS database 
submit data extracted from patients’ 
medical records in their EDs. These 
records are then reviewed by 
professional NEISS coders. The data 
uploaded are also associated with 
a consumer product. A coordinator 
assigns a consumer product code 
for each injury. In addition, other 
characteristics of the patients’ 
injuries are recorded in the database, 
including a free-text narrative of 
an injury by the physician in the 
ED. NEISS coders review all of the 
information. The NEISS coders 
receive detailed training to decrease 
the variability in data collection. 
Previous studies have revealed 
the NEISS database’s accuracy in 
identifying injuries.4 
– 
6
The NEISS database is updated 
frequently and allows for the 
estimation of the epidemiology of 
injury-related ED visits. Hoverboard 
(product code: 5042) and skateboard 
(product code: 1333) injuries in 
children <18 years of age were 
retrospectively analyzed from 
calendar years 2015 and 2016 
by using the NEISS database.7 
Product code 5042 in the NEISS 
database includes a group of 
products (powered scooters and/
or skateboards) that includes 
hoverboards. The analyzed data from 
the NEISS database included patient 
age, sex, injured body part, type of 
injury, ED disposition, and locale of 
injury. In addition, a short narrative 
written by the attending physician 
in the ED regarding the injury is 
included in each case.
Data Analysis
The data were analyzed by using the 
SAS University Edition (SAS Institute, 
Inc, Cary, NC) survey procedure 
PROC SURVEYFREQ function. This 
accounted for the NEISS database’s 
complex statistical design. Sample 
weights from the NEISS database 
were used in all analyses to 
extrapolate national estimates. 
Relationships were examined by 
using χ2 tests and by calculating 
relative risk (RR) with 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs). A P value 
of <.05 was considered statistically 
significant.
Study Variables
Cases were categorized on the basis 
of injury type, ED disposition, locale 
of the injury, and injured body 
part. NEISS database categories for 
injury types included the following: 
(1) fracture, (2) contusion, and 
(3) sprain and/or strain. Injury 
types that did not represent at 
least 5% of the total injuries were 
assigned to the category “other.” 
NEISS database categories for the 
patient’s disposition from the ED 
included the following: (1) treated 
and released, (2) hospitalized 
(admitted, transferred to another 
hospital, or held for observation), 
and (3) left the ED against medical 
advice or without being completely 
evaluated. NEISS database categories 
for the locale of the injury included 
the following: (1) home, (2) public 
street and/or highway, and (3) place 
of recreation (eg, school). NEISS 
database categories for injured body 
part included the following: (1) head, 
(2) wrist, (3) forearm, and (4) ankle. 
Body parts that were injured that 
did not represent at least 5% of the 
total injuries were assigned to the 
category “other.”
Ethical Considerations
This study received institutional 
review board exemption.

 RESULTS
There were an estimated 26 854 
hoverboard injuries during 2015 
and 2016 (95% CI 20 462–33 246); 
summarized in Table 1). The mean 
and median age was 11 years. The 
number of hoverboard injuries 
peaked at ∼12 years of age (Fig 1).  
Boys accounted for 52% of all 
injuries. Of the number of recorded 
cases detailing race (56% of the total 
number of injuries), white users 
accounted for the majority of injuries 
(39%). Of the hoverboard cases 
detailing the locale of the injury, 66% 
occurred at home.
The most common injuries were 
fractures (40%), contusions (17%), 
and strains and/or sprains (13%). 
There were 3 burns in the study 
cohort. Two patients sustained 
injuries from riding a hoverboard in 
the kitchen and colliding with a stove 
of boiling water. The other patient 
developed a friction burn after his 
or her finger was run over by a 
hoverboard. The most common body 
parts injured were the wrist (19%), 
forearm (14%), and head (14%). 
The ankles were the most commonly 
sprained body part (RR = 11.8; 
95% CI 10.8–12.9). The majority of 
patients were treated in the ED and 
discharged from the hospital (95%). 
A small number of patients (<1%) 
left the ED without being completely 
evaluated by a medical provider. 
Head injuries accounted for 14% of 
all admissions to the hospital.
There were ∼121 398 (95% CI 
88 788–154 008) skateboard injuries 
in calendar years 2015 and 2016 
(Table 2). The mean and median age 
of skateboard injuries was 13 years. 
The number of injuries increased 
with age (Fig 1). Of the skateboard 
cases detailing the locale of the 
injury, 52% occurred on the street. 
The most common body part injured 
was the wrist (15%). Fractures 
accounted for 32% of all injuries. 
The ankles were the most commonly 
sprained body part (RR = 3.33; 
95% CI 3.26–3.40). The majority of 
injuries were treated in the ED and 
patients were discharged from the 
hospital (96%). Approximately 3% 
of those with skateboard injuries 
were admitted to the hospital for 
further management. Head injuries 
accounted for 35% of all admissions 
to the hospital.
The forearm and wrist had the 
highest frequency of fractures when 
compared with other body parts 
in those with hoverboard injuries 
(RR = 1.15; 95% CI 1.12–1.18) and 
skateboard injuries (RR = 3.52; 95% 
CI 3.47–3.58) presenting to the ED. 
Fractures accounted for the largest 
number of hospital admissions when 
compared with other injury types 
from hoverboards (RR = 9.06; 95%  
CI 8.80–9.32) and skateboards  
(RR = 3.50; 95% CI 3.29–3.73).
DISCUSSION
During 2015 and 2016, there were 
26 854 hoverboard injuries and 
121 398 skateboard injuries in 
children <18 years of age. The mean 
and median age of hoverboard riders 
was lower than that of skateboard 
riders. The number of users with 
hoverboard injuries presenting to 
the ED peaked at 12 years of age, 
whereas the number of users with 
skateboard injuries presenting to 
the ED increased with age. This 
may be due to the increased risk-
seeking behaviors and/or lack of

Downloaded from 
 parental supervision seen with older 
children. The ratio of male to female 
skateboarders who presented to 
the ED after sustaining an injury 
was ∼3:1 compared with that of 
hoverboard riders, which was ∼1:1. 
It is unclear why boys comprised a 
larger proportion of injuries when 
presenting to the ED for skateboard 
use compared with hoverboard use. 
The majority of skateboard injuries 
occurred on the street (52%), 
whereas the majority of hoverboard 
injuries occurred at home (66%). 
This can be attributable to the ease of 
riding hoverboards at home, whereas 
skateboards require a hard surface 
(ie, asphalt).
The distribution of injuries among 
hoverboard riders and skateboarders 
was similar. Fractures, contusions, 
and sprains and/or strains were the 
most common types of injuries in 
both types of users. However, there 
was a higher number of sprains 
and/or strains in skateboarders 
compared with hoverboard users. 
This difference may be attributed 
to the way users ride these boards. 
Skateboarders can grind rails, flip 
the board (ie, kickflip) and ollie, or 
jump off obstacles. In comparison, 
hoverboard riders primarily use 
it as a ride-on toy (ie, around the 
home or outside), with less room 
for recreational tricks because of 
the innate design of the product. 
This may explain why the majority 
of sprains and/or strains occurred 
around the ankle in skateboarders, 
likely occurring during performing 
tricks with the board. This may 
also explain why hoverboard riders 
injured their wrists more often, 
which likely occurred after falling off 
the toy.
Contrary to recent news 
articles describing hoverboards 
spontaneously catching fire, in this 
cohort, no injuries were observed 
from this mechanism. Three patients 
were burned; however, the burns 
were not associated with device 
malfunction.

 A limitation of these data is not 
knowing whether patients were 
wearing protective gear. A case series 
of 5 hoverboard injuries revealed 
that none of the patients in the study 
were wearing protective gear.4 In 
this cohort, head and wrist injuries 
accounted for >25% of all those with 
hoverboard and skateboard injuries 
presenting to the ED. Fourteen 
percent of all admissions from 
hoverboard injuries and 35% of all 
admissions from skateboard injuries 
presenting to the ED were due to head 
injuries. The head was also the second 
most common body part injured 
by both toys. Although it is unclear 
whether these patients were wearing 
protective gear, a helmet and wrist 
pads may decrease the frequency of 
head and wrist injuries in hoverboard 
riders and skateboarders.
In this study, 40% of skateboard 
injuries and 49% of hoverboard 
injuries in the database did not have 
a documented locale of the injury. 
Another limitation of this study 
and source of potential bias is not 
knowing where a large percentage 
of skateboard and hoverboard 
injuries occurred. Lastly, the data 
from product code 5042 in the NEISS 
database include a group of toys (ie, 
hoverboards and powered scooters 
and skateboards). Thus, it is difficult 
to draw conclusions regarding 
solely hoverboard injuries from this 
product code.
CONCLUSIONS
This study reveals that the wrist, 
head, and forearm were the most 
common injured body parts in 
children presenting to the ED  
with hoverboard and skateboard 
injuries. Fractures were the most  
common diagnosis made in the 
ED resulting from hoverboard and 
skateboard injuries. Head injuries 
and fractures were a common  
cause of admission to the hospital. 
Most hoverboard injuries occurred  
at home, and most skateboard  
injuries occurred on the street.  
By elucidating the characteristics of 
hoverboard and skateboard injuries 
in children, preventive measures 
can be implemented to decrease 
the incidence of injuries and the 
frequency of ED visits.
