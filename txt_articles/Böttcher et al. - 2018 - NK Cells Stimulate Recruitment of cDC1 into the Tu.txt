SUMMARY
Conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1) are crit-
ical for antitumor immunity, and their abundance
within tumors is associated with immune-mediated
rejection and the success of immunotherapy. Here,
we show that cDC1 accumulation in mouse tumors
often depends on natural killer (NK) cells that pro-
duce the cDC1 chemoattractants CCL5 and XCL1.
Similarly, in human cancers, intratumoral CCL5,
XCL1, and XCL2 transcripts closely correlate with
gene signatures of both NK cells and cDC1 and
are associated with increased overall patient sur-
vival. Notably, tumor production of prostaglandin
E2 (PGE2) leads to evasion of the NK cell-cDC1
axis in part by impairing NK cell viability and chemo-
kine production, as well as by causing downregula-
tion of chemokine receptor expression in cDC1. Our
findings reveal a cellular and molecular checkpoint
for intratumoral cDC1 recruitment that is targeted
by tumor-derived PGE2 for immune evasion and
that could be exploited for cancer therapy.
INTRODUCTION
The tumor microenvironment (TME) contains stromal cells and im-
mune cells that shape cancer development and impact the
response to tumor therapy (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011; Pal-
ucka and Coussens, 2016). Intratumoral immune cells comprise
lymphocytes, such as T cells, B, cells and natural killer (NK) cells,
and diverse populations of myeloid cells, including granulocytes,
monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs) (Gajewski
et al., 2013; Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011; Palucka and Cous-
sens, 2016). The different myeloid cells within the TME fulfill
distinct and sometimes opposing roles. Simplistically, intratumoral
monocytes and M2-polarized macrophages can promote cancer
cell growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis, as well as contribute
to the establishment of an immunosuppressive environment.
They are associated with tumor progression and poor clinical
outcome (Noy and Pollard, 2014). In contrast, M1-polarized mac-
rophages and DCs contribute to anti-tumor immunity and are
associated with a favorable outcome (Engblom et al., 2016).
The contribution of conventional DCs (cDCs) to anti-tumor im-
munity reflects their ability to present tumor antigens and to
secrete cytokines that regulate T cell survival and effector func-
tion. cDCs can be divided into at least two subsets, conventional
type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1) and conventional type 2 dendritic
cells (cDC2) (Guilliams et al., 2014; Merad et al., 2013). The
cDC1 subset depends for its development on the transcription
factor Batf3 and can be identified by the selective expression
of the C-type lectin receptor DNGR-1 (aka CLEC9A) and the
chemokine receptor XCR1 and, in non-lymphoid organs and in
tumors, additional expression of the integrin aE (CD103) in the
presence of low expression of CD11b. cDC1 are especially
adept at taking up dead tumor cells and transporting tumor an-
tigens to tumor-draining lymph nodes where they constitute
the key DC subtype responsible for cross-priming anti-tumor
CD8+ T cells (Roberts et al., 2016; Salmon et al., 2016). In addi-
tion to this trafficking role, cDC1 also play a key role within
tumors themselves. Intratumoral cDC1 attract T cells (Spranger
et al., 2017), re-stimulate and expand tumor-specific CD8+
T cells (Broz et al., 2014), and support T cell effector function
by secreting interleukin (IL)-12 (Ruffell et al., 2014). The overall
importance of cDC1 in anti-tumor immunity is underscored by
multiple studies demonstrating that the lack of cDC1 in Batf3�/�
mice abolishes the rejection of immunogenic tumors and the
response to adoptive T cell therapy and to immune checkpoint
blockade (Broz et al., 2014; Hildner et al., 2008; Salmon et al.,
2016; Sa
´ nchez-Paulete et al., 2016; Spranger et al., 2015).
Human cDC1 are very rare within the TME and often excluded
from early tumor stages, which might hinder anti-tumor immunity
and contribute to cancer progression. Although intratumoral
cDC1 have not been investigated in humans in as much detail
as in mice, cDC1 abundance in human melanoma correlates

 with T cell infiltration and the ratio of cDC1-selective transcripts
over macrophage-restricted transcripts can be used as a prog-
nostic marker for cancer patient survival (Broz et al., 2014;
Spranger et al., 2017). Therapies aimed at increasing cDC1 abun-
dance in tumors or facilitating their activation may therefore boost
anti-tumor immunity and potentially increase the responsiveness
of cancer patients to immunotherapy (Broz et al., 2014; Salmon
et al., 2016; Spranger et al., 2017). However, the mechanisms
determining theabundance of cDC1 at thetumor site remainenig-
matic and it is unclear whether cDC1 are actively recruited into the
TME and if this requires the participation of other cell types.
Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a prostanoid with immune-regula-
tory function that is produced by many cell types and can further
be released upon cell death (Hangai et al., 2016). We previously
found that many tumors secrete PGE2 to suppress anti-cancer
immunity (Zelenay et al., 2015). In such tumors, genetic ablation
of cyclooxygenases, encoded by the Ptgs1 and Ptgs2 genes,
leads to inability to produce PGE2 and renders the cancers sus-
ceptible to cDC1-dependent CD8+ T cell-mediated immune con-
trol (Zelenay et al., 2015). Mouse tumors lacking PGE2 production
are therefore an ideal system in which to dissect the mechanisms
underlying cDC1 accumulation. Here, we show that such tumors
are infiltrated by cDC1, and we identify a key role for intratumoral
NK cells in producing CCL5 and XCL1 chemokines that promote
cDC1 recruitment. We provide evidence that a similar NK cell/
chemokine functional axis determines cDC1 abundance in hu-
man melanoma, breast cancer, lung cancer, and head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma and show that it impacts on pa-
tient survival. Finally, we uncover a role for PGE2 both in diminish-
ing NK cell survival and function and in downregulating cDC1
responsiveness to chemoattractants. These data provide in-
sights into the control of cDC1 accumulation in tumors in mice
and humans and support the rational design of therapies aiming
to increase cDC1 numbers in tumors that might help overcoming
resistance to current immunotherapies.
RESULTS
cDC1 Accumulate within the Tumor Microenvironment
of COX-Deficient Tumors
We established a flow cytometry staining protocol that allows
distinction between cDC1 and other CD11c+MHC class II
(MHCII)+ myeloid cell populations including CD64+ macro-
phages and CD11b+ cDC2 in tumors (Figure 1A). CD103+ but
not other cells (putative cDC2) among CD64�CD11c+MHCII+
cells expressed DNGR-1 (Sancho et al., 2008), XCR1 (Dorner
et al., 2009), and IRF8 (Ginhoux et al., 2009) (Figure 1B), vali-
dating them as bona fide cDC1. We used the staining protocol
to assess cDC1 abundance in PGE2-producing control (COX-
competent) BRAFV600E and Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/� (COX-deficient)
BRAFV600E melanoma tumors (Zelenay et al., 2015). We focused
initial analyses on 4 days after tumor cell implantation, before
the onset of any T cell-mediated immune control of the COX-
deficient tumors (Zelenay et al., 2015). As reported (Zelenay
et al., 2015), control and Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/� BRAFV600E tumors
were broadly equivalent in terms of total number of CD45+ cells,
CD11c+MHCII+ cells, and tumor mass (Figure 1C). However,
Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/� BRAFV600E showed markedly greater accumula-
tion of cDC1, both in frequency and in total numbers (Figure 1C)
(Zelenay et al., 2015). Consistent with the flow cytometric anal-
ysis, cDC1 were sparse in confocal images of sections from
control BRAFV600E tumors but abundant in those from Ptgs1/
Ptgs2�/� BRAFV600E tumors (Figures 1D and 1E). In addition
to increased density, cDC1 often formed multicellular clusters
within Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/� BRAFV600E tumor tissue (Figures 1D
and 1E). Tumor infiltration by cDC1s was confirmed by distance
analyses after surface reconstruction of cDC1 profiles in
confocal images, which revealed that cDC1 in Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/�
BRAFV600E melanomas were located further away from the tumor
margin and from CD31+ blood vessels than in control tumors
(Figure 1F). We extended the analysis to other mouse cancer
models and found that, similar to BRAFV600E melanoma, tumors

colorectal cancer cells or 4T1 breast cancer cells displayed
low numbers of intratumoral cDC1 (Figures S1A–S1D). Again,
we observed altered localization of cDC1 in the COX-sufficient
tumors, which displayed fewer clusters of cDC1 deep within
the tumor parenchyma (Figures S1A–S1F). Finally, we confirmed
that cDC1 recruitment is functionally relevant by demonstrating
that immune control of COX-deficient tumors is lost in cDC1-
deficient Batf3�/� mice (Figure 1G) (Zelenay et al., 2015). This
loss of control correlated with markedly reduced tumor infiltra-
tion by CD8+ T cells (Figure 1H) and the fact that the few infil-
trating CD8+ T cells, including tissue-resident memory T cells

 (TRM) identified by CD103 expression, did not express gran-
zyme B (GzmB) (Figure 1I). We conclude that tumor-derived
PGE2 impairs the accumulation and spatial positioning of cDC1
within the TME and that an unknown mechanism induces the
accumulation of cDC1 in COX-deficient tumors, which is key
for subsequent CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-cancer immunity.
cDC1 Accumulation in COX-Deficient BRAFV600E
Melanoma Depends on NK Cells
In addition to an increase in cDC1 and modest elevation of T cell
populations, Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/� BRAFV600E melanomas showed
a prominent early rise in NK1.1+CD3� cells (Figure 2A), which
was sustained over several days (Figure S2A). NK1.1+CD3� cells
stained positive for CD49b and GzmB, suggesting that they were
conventional NK cells and not ILC1 (Serafini et al., 2015) (Fig-
ure S2B). The distribution of intratumoral NK cells was highly
similar to that of cDC1, evident as multicellular clusters of both
cell types (Figure 2B) located within 5–10 mm of each other (Fig-
ure S2C) and with NK cells positioned closer to cDC1 than
to other MHCII+ cells (Figure 2C). Similarly, in an autochthonous
genetically engineered breast cancer model (MMTV-PyMT),
cDC1 and NK cells were often found in multicellular clusters
(Figures 2D and 2E), indicating that co-localization is not a
consequence of tumor cell transplantation.
Given the close apposition, we tested the requirement of
NK cells for cDC1 accumulation by measuring cDC1 content
in
Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/�
BRAFV600E
tumors
transplanted
into
Rag2�/�Il2rg�/� mice, which lack NK cells, T cells, and B cells
versus Rag1�/� mice, which lack T and B cells but contain NK
cells. Whereas we observed many cDC1 in wild-type (WT) and
Rag1�/� mice, cDC1 failed to accumulate in tumors transplanted
into Rag2�/�Il2rg�/� mice (Figure 2F). In addition, antibody-
mediated depletion of NK cells in WT or Rag1�/� mice (Fig-
ure S2D) resulted in a decrease in cDC1 within Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/�
BRAFV600E tumors (Figure 2G) irrespective of total tumor mass
(Figure S2E). By microscopy, we confirmed reduced cDC1
numbers in tumor sections and further noticed decreased
cDC1 clustering within Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/� BRAFV600E tumors trans-
planted into Rag2�/�Il2rg�/� mice or into NK cell-depleted mice
(Figures S2F–S2H). Of note, we also observed a reduction in total
CD11c+MHCII+ cells within Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/� BRAFV600E tumors in
NK cell-depleted mice, suggesting that accumulation of some
cDC2 might also depend on NK cells (Figure S2I). NK cell deple-
tion was further associated with a decrease in intratumoral CD8+
but not CD4+ T cells (Figures S2J and S2K). In contrast to
the observed dependence of cDC1 accumulation on intratu-
moral NK cells, cDC1-deficiency in Batf3�/� mice had no impact
on NK cell numbers in Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/� BRAFV600E tumors
(Figure 2H).
Antibody-mediated depletion of NK cells resulted in rapid
growth of Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/� tumors in WT mice (Figure 2I). This
was similar to the loss of immune control seen in Batf3�/� mice
but NK cell depletion in the latter further exacerbated tumor
growth (Figure 2I), arguing that some but not all of the effects
of NK cells on tumor control are mediated through cDC1. This
might be expected from the fact that NK cells can directly kill
tumor cells and produce cytokines with anti-tumor effects
(Guillerey et al., 2016). Taken together, these data suggest that
NK cells play a key role in anti-tumor immunity in part but not
exclusively by promoting intratumoral accumulation and posi-
tioning of cDC1.
NK Cells Are the Major Source of XCL1 and CCL5 in
Tumors and Are Directly Inhibited by PGE2
Analysis of gene expression data from the Immunological
Genome (ImmGen) Project (Heng et al., 2008) indicated that six
chemokines, CCL5, CCL3, XCL1, CXCL1, CCL4, and CCL27A,
can be expressed by NK cells (Figure 3A). In a protein array,
lysates of Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/� BRAFV600E early (day 4) tumors dis-
played 45-fold more CCL5 than COX-sufficient control tumor ly-
sates and a minor (<2-fold) increase in CCL27A (Figures 3B and
3C). Other chemokines putatively produced by NK cells either
showed a small reduction between control and Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/�
BRAFV600E tumors (CXCL1) in the protein array or could not be
detected by this analysis (CCL3 and CCL4). We also observed
higher CXCL10 levels in Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/� BRAFV600E tumors, a
chemokine that can be produced by intratumoral DCs to attract
T cells (Spranger et al., 2017). High levels of CCL5 protein in
lysates from Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/� BRAFV600E tumors but not control
BRAFV600E tumor lysates were confirmed by cytometric bead
array (CBA) analysis (Figure 3D). Of note, we did not find any
differences in CCL5 levels between lysates of control or Ptgs1/
Ptgs2�/� BRAFV600E cells cultured in vitro, suggesting that tu-
mor-infiltrating cells rather than the tumor cells themselves are
the main source of this chemokine in vivo (Figure S3A).
Because XCL1, the ligand for the chemokine receptor XCR1
expressed by cDC1, was not represented in the protein or the
cytometric bead arrays, we analyzed tumor extracts for Xcl1
mRNA. Similar to CCL5 protein, Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/� BRAFV600E but
not control BRAFV600E day 4 tumors contained abundant XCL1
transcripts (Figure 3E). By intracellular flow cytometry, NK cells
but not MHCII+ cells stained positive for CCL5 protein and for
Xcl1 mRNA in Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/� BRAFV600E but not control tumors
(Figure 3F). Rare infiltrating CD8+ T cells at this time point also

 produced CCL5 but expressed only low levels of Xcl1 mRNA
(Figure 3G). At a later time point (12 days), when T cell infiltration
is much more prominent, CCL5 protein was detectable in NK
and CD8+ T cells in Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/� BRAFV600E tumors but Xcl1
mRNA still remained largely restricted to NK cells and was
not highly expressed by any T cells, including TRM (Figures
3H–3J). Similar observations were made in spontaneously devel-
oping mammary tumors in MMTV-PyMT mice (Figures 3K–3M).
In line with these data, the levels of CCL5 protein and Xcl1
mRNA in day 4 Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/� BRAFV600E tumors were identical
between WT and Batf3�/� mice (Figures S3B and S3C), but were
severely reduced in WT mice depleted of NK cells (Figures 4A
and 4B). Similarly, we detected very low levels of CCL5
protein and Xcl1 mRNA in Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/� BRAFV600E tumors
transplanted into Rag2�/�Il2rg�/� mice (Figures 4C and 4D)
but observed only a minimal, non-significant, reduction of
CCL5 and XCL1 expression in Rag1�/� mice (Figures 4A and
4B). Therefore, in the absence of PGE2, intratumoral NK cells
are a major source of XCL1 and CCL5.
Finally, to examine whether PGE2 directly impacts NK cell pro-
duction of CCL5 and XCL1, we isolated splenic NK cells from WT
mice and stimulated them through NK1.1, an activatory receptor.
Anti-NK1.1 induced secretion of CCL5 and XCL1, which was
strongly reduced in a dose-dependent manner in presence of
PGE2 (Figures 4E and 4F). Survival of NK cells was also markedly
reduced by PGE2 even in the presence of IL-2 (Figure 4G). IL-15
or IL-15:15Ra complex was able to rescue NK cell survival
but not the impaired CCL5 and XCL1 production (Figures S4A–
S4C). Similar to splenic NK cells, NK cells isolated from tumors
were susceptible to PGE2 inhibition (Figures 4H and 4I). Despite
its marked effects on function and survival, PGE2 did not induce
the expression of the co-inhibitory receptors TIM-3 and PD-1 by
NK cells in vitro (data not shown) or in vivo (Figure 4J). These data
indicate that NK cells are a direct target of tumor-derived PGE2,
which decreases cell viability and inhibits production of putative
cDC1 chemoattractants.
XCL1 and CCL5 Mediate Recruitment of cDC1 into
Tumors to Promote Immune Control
cDC1 express XCR1, the only receptor for XCL1 (Dorner et al.,
2009), and CCR1 and CCR5, both of which bind CCL5 (McColl,
2002). Consistent with that expression pattern, cDC1 generated
from bone marrow cells in vitro migrated efficiently toward CCL5
and XCL1 in a transwell assay (Figure 5A). To investigate whether
the two chemokines are necessary for cDC1 recruitment into tu-
mors, we treated WT mice with neutralizing antibodies against
CCL5 (aCCL5) and XCL1 (aXCL1) or isotype-matched control
antibodies and implanted them with Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/� BRAFV600E
tumor cells. We found that in vivo blockade of CCL5 and XCL1
resulted in markedly reduced cDC1 accumulation within tumors
(Figure 5B). These data indicate that cDC1 accumulation in the
TME requires CCL5 and XCL1.
Single loss of either CCR5 or XCR1 was not sufficient to
block intratumoral cDC1 accumulation (data not shown), likely
because of receptor redundancy, and we were not able to test
mice doubly deficient in the two receptors because of genetic
linkage of the loci. Instead, we used gain-of-function experi-
ments to determine whether CCL5 or XCL1 are sufficient to
mediate cDC1 recruitment into the TME. Four days after inocula-
tion of WT mice, cDC1 accumulation was significantly increased
in Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/� BRAFV600E tumors retrovirally transduced to
express CCL5 or XCL1 compared to tumors formed by mock-
transduced (EMPTY) cells (Figure 5C). Consistent with increased
cDC1 accumulation, Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/� BRAFV600E tumors ex-
pressing CCL5 or XCL1 showed accelerated rejection in WT
mice compared to mock-transduced cells (Figure 5D) but all
grew at a comparable rate in Batf3�/� mice (Figure 5E). The latter
indicates that CCL5- or XCL1-expressing tumors are not intrinsi-
cally compromised in their ability to grow in vivo but are
controlled by the immune system in a cDC1-dependent manner.
In NK cell-depleted mice, Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/� BRAFV600E tumors ex-
pressing XCL1 grew more slowly than mock-transduced cells
(Figure 5F), suggesting that XCL1-mediated recruitment of
cDC1 can partially compensate for the loss of tumor immune
control caused by NK cell ablation.
Next, we extended this analysis to other tumor models. Similar
to Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/� BRAFV600E tumors, B16-OVA tumors (that do
not produce PGE2) (Zelenay et al., 2015) expressing CCL5 and
XCL1 showed increased accumulation of cDC1 within the TME
(Figure 5G) and decreased tumor growth (Figure 5H). A similar
trend was observed for tumors formed by Ptgs2�/� CT26 colo-
rectal cancer cells in BALB/c mice (Figures 5I and 5J). We
conclude that cDC1 accumulation within the TME can be
induced by the cDC1-recruiting chemokines CCL5 and XCL1
to improve tumor immune control.
PGE2 Inhibits the Responsiveness of cDC1 to
Chemokines
We further investigated whether CCL5 or XCL1 expression also
induced cDC1 accumulation in COX-competent tumors, by-
passing PGE2-mediated suppression of NK cells. Interestingly,
neither CCL5 nor XCL1 expression was able to rescue the low
abundance of cDC1 in BRAFV600E tumors (Figure S5A), which
all grew similarly to mock-transduced cells in WT mice (Fig-
ure S5B). Similar observations were made with COX-sufficient
CT26 tumors expressing CCL5 or XCL1 (Figures S5C and

 S5D). Therefore, chemokine expression alone is not sufficient
to recruit cDC1 into PGE2-producing tumors, suggesting that
PGE2 not only suppresses CCL5 and XCL1 production by NK
cells but also impairs cDC1 responsiveness to the chemokines.
Consistent with that notion, cDC1 exposed to conditioned
medium (CM) from PGE2-producing tumors were impaired in
their migration toward CCL5 and XCL1 (Figures S5E and
S5F). Furthermore, cDC1 incubated with CM from PGE2-pro-
ducing cells or with synthetic PGE2 downregulated Xcr1 and
Ccr5 mRNA and XCR1 protein (Figures S5G–S5I). XCR1 down-
regulation was also seen in cDC1 isolated from BRAFV600E tu-
mors (Figure S5J). These data indicate that PGE2 can block
the ability of cDC1 to migrate toward the chemokines CCL5
and XCL1 in part by inducing downregulation of the respective
receptors.

Correlation between NK Cells, Chemokines, and cDC1

Figure 4. NK Cells Are the Main Source of CCL5 and XCL1 in COX-Deficient Tumors
(A and B) WT mice, WT mice depleted of NK cells, or Rag1�/� mice were injected s.c. with 2 3 106 control or Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/� BRAFV600E cells and analyzed 4 days
later for CCL5 protein (A) and Xcl1 mRNA (B).
(C and D) WT mice, Rag1�/� and Rag2�/�Il2rg�/� mice were injected s.c. with 2 3 106 control or Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/� BRAFV600E cells and analyzed 4 days later for

(E–G) Splenic NK cells from WT mice were cultured with IL-2 and stimulated with plate-bound anti-NK1.1 for 16 hr in the presence or absence of the indicated
concentrations of PGE2. Culture supernatants were analyzed for CCL5 (E) and XCL1 (F) proteins while NK cells were analyzed for survival by flow cytometric
analysis with annexin V and propidium iodide (G).
(H and I) NK cells isolated from Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/� BRAFV600E tumors were stimulated with plate-bound anti-NK1.1 for 16 hr in vitro in the presence or absence of the
indicated concentration of PGE2. Culture supernatants were analyzed for CCL5 (H) and XCL1 (I) proteins.
(J) Expression of TIM-3 and PD-1 on NK cells in BRAFV600E tumors at day 4 and day 12 after tumor transplantation.
Data in (A)–(D) are pooled from at least two independent experiments with 3–5 mice per group and represented as mean per group ± SEM. Data from one out of at
least two experiments is shown in (E)–(J). Error bars indicate mean of duplicate wells ± SD; (F): n.d., not detected. (A–D): n.s., non-significant, ***p < 0.001.

 dataset of 38 populations of human hematopoietic cells (No-
vershtern et al., 2011). We additionally probed for XCL2, a pa-
ralog of XCL1 that is found in humans but not mice and also
binds to XCR1 with high affinity (Fox et al., 2015). Both XCL1
and XCL2 were highly expressed within the CD56� (often
referred to as CD56dim) subset of NK cells (Figure 6A). CCL5
was expressed in CD56� and CD56+ NK cells, as well as in other
immune cell populations such as effector and memory CD8+
T cells (Figure 6A). Therefore, human NK cells can produce the
chemokines CCL5, XCL1, and XCL2 and are a rare source of
the latter two, at least in blood under steady-state conditions.

To investigate the presence of these
chemokines in human cancers, we looked
at tumor gene expression data from The
Cancer
Genome
Atlas
(TCGA).
When
analyzing TCGA datasets for skin cuta-
neous melanoma (SKCM, n = 470 pa-
tients), breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA,
n = 1098), head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSC, n = 528), and lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD, n = 585), we
observed a positive correlation between
the three chemokines XCL1, XCL2, and
CCL5 that was highly significant in each
dataset (Figures 6B and S6A), consistent
with the notion that they might all be pro-
duced by the same intratumoral cell type. To assess whether
that type could be NK cells, we compared a chemokine gene
expression signature containing XCL1, XCL2, and CCL5 with a
broad signature of NK cells (Figure S6B). We observed a highly
significant, positive correlation between the two gene signatures
in all four TCGA datasets (Figure 6C).
Next, we investigated whether cDC1 accumulation in human
tumors correlated with the abundance of NK cells and the che-
mokines. To identify transcripts best suited to identify cDC1,
we utilized a recently published gene expression dataset for
DC populations in different human tissues (Heidkamp et al.,

 2016). We derived a human cDC1 signature that included
CLEC9A (Poulin et al., 2012), XCR1 (Bachem et al., 2010; Dorner
et al., 2009; Fox et al., 2015), CLNK, and the transcription factor
BATF3 (Robbins et al., 2008) (although the latter was also ex-
pressed at low levels in cDC2). We excluded CCR7, THBD
(CD141/BDCA3), IRF8, ITGAE (CD103), FLT3, and ZBTB46,
which have previously been used as cDC1 markers (Broz
et al., 2014; Roberts et al., 2016) but, in our analysis, displayed
promiscuous expression (Figure 6D). In all cancer types, our
cDC1 signature showed a high degree of positive correlation
with both the gene signatures for NK cells (Figure 6E) and the
chemokine signature (Figure 6F). The 3-way correlation always
reached significance but was most profound in melanoma and
breast cancer (Figure 6G). A CD8 T cell signature (Figure S6B)
also correlated with the signatures for cDC1, NK cells, and
chemokines (Figures 6G and S6C–S6E), consistent with the
notion that the interplay between NK cells and cDC1 favors
CD8+ T cell-dependent anti-tumor immunity.
Gene Signatures of NK Cells and cDC1 Positively
Correlate with Cancer Patient Survival
Finally, we assessed the degree to which these observations
related to disease outcome. Notably, higher expression of NK
signature genes in tumor samples (Figures 7A and 7B) was
significantly associated with patient survival in all cancer types
(Figure 7C; Table S1). Similarly, stratification of patients by
expression of cDC1-associated genes (Figures 7D and 7E) indi-
cated that a higher cDC1 signature in tumors is positively asso-
ciated with survival (Figure 7F; Table S1). Of note, a single cDC1
marker, CLEC9A, was also prognostic of patient survival (Fig-
ure 7G) and the cDC1 signature was at least as powerful a pre-
dictor of cancer patient survival as a CD8 T cell signature
(Figure 7H).
Consistent with the analyses in TCGA datasets, we found a
similar positive correlation of NK cell and cDC1 gene signatures
in an independent cohort of breast cancer patients (Figures S7A
and S7B) in which cancers were further classified into clinical
groups, including the triple-negative breast cancer subtype
(TNBC) that has poor prognosis. Strikingly, TNBC samples
showed a very significant positive association between cDC1
and NK cell signature genes and survival (Figures S7A and
S7B), which was even more pronounced than when all breast
cancer patients were analyzed without separating by tumor
subgroup. Altogether, these data indicate across a wide array
of human tumors that those with the highest NK cell and cDC1
content display the best prognosis. Importantly, high NK cell
and cDC1 content was not merely a proxy for cancers with
high overall immune infiltration as expression of monocyte/
macrophage-specific genes such as CD68 or CD14 in tumor
samples was not positively correlated with patient survival in
any type of cancer (Figure S7C and data not shown). Thus, our
analysis reveals the importance of the quality rather than the
quantity of the immune infiltrate and the favorable consequences
of NK cell and cDC1 recruitment.
Similar to the analyses of cDC1 and NK cell gene signatures,
we observed a positive correlation with survival when we ranked
melanoma, HNSC and TNBC patients according to expression
of CCL5, XCL1, and XCL2 (Figures S7D and S7E). However, in
lung and breast cancer, with the exception of TNBC, the associ-
ation between higher chemokine signature and survival did not
reach significance (Figure S7D), despite them all displaying an
association of survival with cDC1 signatures. This discrepancy
is likely due to chemokine redundancy and additional mecha-
nisms contributing to the accumulation of cDC1 within some
tumors. Finally, it is possible that pleiotropic chemokines such
as CCL5 can contribute to tumor progression by recruiting regu-
latory T cells (Velasco-Vela
´ zquez et al., 2014), obscuring
the prognostic value of the three chemokine signature (data
not shown).
DISCUSSION
Myeloid cells such as macrophages and DCs within the TME
shape tumor development and anti-cancer immunity. cDC1 fulfill
a unique role in promoting the latter through their ability to trans-
port tumor antigens to tumor draining LNs for T cell priming, to
produce chemokines that recruit T cells into the TME, and to
locally secrete IL-12 and restimulate tumor-infiltrating T cells.
Because of these functions, the abundance of intratumoral
cDC1s in tumors has previously been suggested to correlate
with immune-mediated control and favorable outcome in both
mice and humans (Broz et al., 2014; Salmon et al., 2016;
Spranger et al., 2015, 2017). However, the mechanisms that
control the accumulation of cDC1 within tumors remain poorly
understood. Here, we uncover a key role for NK cells in the pro-
duction of chemoattractants, including CCL5 and XCL1/2, that
are necessary for the accumulation of cDC1 in incipient tumors
and for tumor immune control. We also show that this axis
can be subverted by tumor-derived PGE2, which both impairs
NK cell function and causes downregulation of the XCR1 and
CCR5 chemokine receptors on cDC1. Finally, we suggest that in-
tratumoral cDC1 accumulation in human tumors is regulated by a

 similar mechanism as in mice and is positively correlated with
favorable patient outcome in several different types of cancer.
These findings illuminate the early events leading to tumor immu-
nity and uncover a new checkpoint in immunity that could form
the basis for novel cancer immunotherapies and for improving
current ones.
NK cells contribute to anti-tumor immunity in mice and are
associated with good prognosis in human cancer patients (Pal-
ucka and Coussens, 2016; Vesely et al., 2011). They can secrete
cytostatic cytokines such as interferon gamma (IFN-g) and can
directly kill tumor cells, functions that render NK cells an attrac-
tive potential target for immunotherapy. Our analyses indicate
an additional, so far unrecognized, function of NK cells in the
recruitment of cDC1 into the TME. Interestingly, exclusion of
cDC1 in lung adenocarcinoma has been reported to coincide
with a lack of intratumoral NK cells (Lavin et al., 2017), indepen-
dently supporting the idea that NK cells contribute to the accu-
mulation of cDC1 in tumors. At the same time, our data raise
the question of how NK cells recognize tumor cells and accumu-
late within incipient tumors. Cells undergoing neoplastic trans-
formation often show increased expression of ligands for NK
cell activating receptors (Diefenbach et al., 2001; Gasser et al.,
2005), which endow NK cells with the ability to participate in tis-
sue stress surveillance responses (Hayday, 2009; Raulet and
Guerra, 2009). Therefore, activation of NK cell receptors by li-
gands expressed by transformed cells might be key for innate
anti-tumor immunity and, as revealed here, also sets in motion
adaptive immunity through production of cDC1 chemoattrac-
tants. Consistent with this notion, stimulation of the activating
receptor NK1.1 on NK cells in vitro resulted in secretion of
both CCL5 and XCL1. However, the degree to which activating
ligands expressed by cancer cells versus additional signals
(e.g., from cytokines such as type I IFNs or IL-15) (Delconte
et al., 2016) contribute to NK cell-dependent ignition of anti-can-
cer immunity remains to be elucidated.
Although fully differentiated cDC1 can be detected in blood,
especially in humans, cDC1 that accumulate in tissues in
steady-state are thought to develop from committed precursors
(pre-cDC1) that originate in bone marrow and travel via blood to
seed peripheral organs (Grajales-Reyes et al., 2015; Liu et al.,
2009; Schlitzer et al., 2015). However, it is not known whether
‘‘emergency’’ needs for cDC1, such during tumor development,
are met by increased pre-cDC1 recruitment. Notably, pre-cDC1
do not express the chemokine receptors XCR1 or CCR5 (Gra-
jales-Reyes et al., 2015), implying that they cannot respond to
CCL5 and XCL1 secreted by intratumoral NK cells. Similarly,
the steady-state tissue colonization of tissues by DCs is NK
cell-independent. Therefore, while it will be important to investi-
gate the degree to which pre-cDC1 might be selectively recruited
to tumors, our findings, including from ex vivo migration assays,
suggest that the NK cell-dependent cDC1 accumulation could
additionally rely on the recruitment and/or retention of differenti-
ated cDC1, either from the circulation or surrounding tissue.
In murine tumors, intratumoral cDC1 were located in very
close proximity to NK cells and both cell types were often situ-
ated in multicellular clusters within the TME. It seems likely that
these clusters are a result of the chemotactic cues provided by
NK cells, but might additionally be supported by chemokines
secreted by cDC1 (e.g., CXCL9 and CXCL10) that could attract
NK cells via CXCR3 (Spranger et al., 2017; Wendel et al.,
2008). The observed clustering of cDC1 and NK cells within
the TME might ensure further communication between these
two cell types, eventually leading to mutual activation of cDC1
and NK cells and facilitating anti-tumor immunity, similar to
reciprocal activation of cDC1 and XCL1-secreting T cells in
lymph nodes and within the intestine (Brewitz et al., 2017; Ohta
et al., 2016). Consistent with this possibility, a very recent study
suggests that cDC1-derived IL-12 is essential for the anti-tumor
activity of NK cells (Mittal et al., 2017) while NK cell-derived IFN-g
sustains production of IL-12 by cDC1 (Alexandre et al., 2016).
Nevertheless, it is possible that, in some instances, infiltrating
T or other cells producing CCL5, XCL1, and/or XCL2 can substi-
tute for NK cells in maintaining the recruitment of cDC1.
The generation of PGE2 by elevated COX activity is a mecha-
nism by which tumors can evade anti-tumor immunity (Zelenay
et al., 2015). Our results indicate that a key target of PGE2 is
NK cells, which fail to accumulate in PGE2-producing tumors
and are further impaired in their survival and ability to produce
CCL5 and XCL1. PGE2 likely has additional effects on NK cells,
such as inducing the downregulation of NK cell activatory recep-
tors or cytotoxic effector molecules (Kalinski, 2012). In addition,
autocrine PGE2 decreases the expression of activating NK cell
receptor-ligands on tumor cells (Pietra et al., 2012). However,
in addition to targeting NK cell activity, PGE2 also hinders
cDC1 directly, by causing downregulation of the chemokine
receptors that promote recruitment into tumors. Therefore,
PGE2 impairs anti-tumor immunity by acting on at least two
cellular layers of the innate immune system, NK cells and
cDC1. In addition, PGE2 is known to also directly suppress cyto-
toxic T cell action (Chen et al., 2015; Su et al., 2011) underscoring
its role as a major immunosuppressive mediator that interferes
with multiple aspects of anti-cancer immunity.

 In a previous study, the ratio between transcripts from a set of
genes enriched in cDC1 and levels of transcripts expressed by
other myeloid cells proved to be a prognostic marker for cancer
patient survival (Broz et al., 2014). Furthermore, CCR7 transcript
levels in a cohort of melanoma patients correlated with survival,
pointing to a potential role for CCR7-expressing cells, including
cDC1, in anti-tumor immunity (Roberts et al., 2016). However,
the transcripts used in those studies are not entirely selective
for cDC1 and, therefore, we derived a new cDC1 gene signature
based on the transcriptome of DC subsets across several human
tissues (Heidkamp et al., 2016). The selectivity of the cDC1
signature described here was independently confirmed in a
recent unbiased genomic profiling of human DC subsets and
monocytes by single-cell RNA-sequencing, which established
cDC1-restricted expression of CLEC9A, XCR1, CLNK, and
BATF3 (Villani et al., 2017). This new cDC1 signature provides
a powerful means to demonstrate a positive association of
cDC1 with patient survival in several human cancers, including
metastatic melanoma, breast cancer, head and neck squa-
mous cell carcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma. Interestingly,
CLEC9A as a single cDC1-specific marker showed almost iden-
tical prognostic value in these analyses, underscoring the strong
discriminatory power of CLEC9A in identifying cDC1 in tissues,
as recently confirmed (Villani et al., 2017). We therefore propose
that CLEC9A should be used for assessing cDC1 content in
tumors, either as a single marker or in combination with other
strictly cDC1-specific genes such as XCR1. However, XCR1
expression on intratumoral cDC1 has to be carefully evaluated,
given our observation that tumor-derived PGE2 can induce its
downregulation.
Similar to cDC1 in mice, human cDC1 seem to be very rare in
tumors and are often excluded from samples associated with
tumor progression (Lavin et al., 2017). In line with this, we found
a very low abundance of cDC1-specific transcripts in some
TCGA datasets such as colorectal cancer, precluding us to
evaluate the role of cDC1 in that cancer (data not shown). Inter-
estingly, key enzymes for PGE2 production such as COX-2 are
often overexpressed in colorectal cancer and associated with
poor prognosis (Dannenberg and Subbaramaiah, 2003), sug-
gesting that PGE2 might be one of the mechanism responsible
for the scarcity of cDC1 in the TME of some human tumors.
In line with this, we detected a significant negative correlation
between the transcript levels of PTGS2 and XCL1 or XCL2 in
some but not all the TCGA patient datasets analyzed in our
study (data not shown). Further studies are necessary to deter-
mine the exact contribution of PGE2 to cDC1 scarcity in human
cancer.
Our findings on the interplay between NK cells and cDC1
within the TME have several therapeutic implications. First, our
analyses of human cancer samples clearly establish that dearth
of cDC1 is associated with poor prognosis of patient outcome,
as previously suggested (Broz et al., 2014). This implies that
cDC1 have a role in spontaneous anti-tumor immunity in hu-
mans, as in mice. Given that intratumoral cDC1 are also essential
for T cell-based therapies in mouse tumor models (Broz et al.,
2014; Salmon et al., 2016; Sa
´ nchez-Paulete et al., 2016;
Spranger et al., 2015), our data further indicate that a low fre-
quency of cDC1 might be one reason for the low response rate
of cancer patients to immune checkpoint blockade. It would be
of great interest to establish whether cDC1 accumulation (e.g.,
determined by assessing cDC1-specific transcripts such as
CLEC9A) can serve as a predictive biomarker for the outcome
of such treatments. Second, our data indicate that increasing
the accumulation of intratumoral cDC1 enhances tumor immune
control even in the absence of innate immune stimuli that delib-
erately promote cDC1 activation. Locally stimulating intratu-
moral NK cells or developing XCR1 ligands to attract cDC1
into the TME could be an attractive therapeutic means of eliciting
anti-tumor immunity and increasing the response rate to immu-
notherapy. On this note, it seems intuitive to preferentially target
the XCL1/XCL2-XCR1 axis rather than CCL5 to guide cDC1 into
tumors, thereby ensuring that CCL5-mediated recruitment of
tumor-promoting immune cells such as macrophages or regula-
tory T cells is avoided. Therapeutic strategies aiming to increase
cDC1 numbers in tumors might benefit from combination with
COX-inhibitors, especially in tumors that show high levels
of PGE2 production. Finally, it is likely that additional immuno-
suppressive mechanisms contribute to excluding NK cells and
cDC1 from tumors. Identifying such factors may help develop
new strategies to augment cDC1 recruitment into tumors
and increase the fraction of patients benefiting from cancer
immunotherapy.

 EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Mice
C57BL/6, MMTV-PyMT transgenic C57BL/6 mice, Batf3�/�, Rag1�/�, Rag2�/�Il2rg�/� and BALB/c mice were bred at The Francis
Crick Institute under specific pathogen-free conditions. Mice were used at 6-12 weeks of age, gender-matched and littermates of
the same sex were randomly assigned to treatment or control groups in all experiments. All animal experiments were performed
in accordance with national and institutional guidelines for animal care and were approved by the Francis Crick Institute Biological
Resources Facility Strategic Oversight Committee (incorporating the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body) and by the Home
Office, UK.
Cell lines and primary cell cultures
Mycoplasma negative BRAFV600E melanoma, CT26 colorectal cancer, 4T1 breast cancer, B16-OVA and GP2-293 cell lines were and
cultured in complete RPMI medium (RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum, 50mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 100U/ml Penicillin, 100mg/ml
Streptomycin, 292ng/ml L-Glutamin). COX-sufficient control and Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/� cell lines were generated by CRISPR/Cas9-medi-
ated gene editing as described previously (Zelenay et al., 2015). In vitro differentiation of CD103+ cDC1 was performed with primary
bone marrow cells from female C57BL/6 mice at 6-12 weeks of age using the induced CD103 DC protocol (Mayer et al., 2014). DCs
were harvested 12-14 days after the start of the culture and used for experiments.
METHOD DETAILS
Tumor cell injections
Cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed three times in PBS. 2x105 or 2x106 cells were injected s.c. in 100ml endotoxin-free
PBS on the flank of recipient mice. Tumor growth was measured using a digital caliper. Tumor diameters stated in the figures refer to
the average of the longest diameter and its perpendicular for each tumor.
NK cell depletion in vivo
For depletion of NK cells, mice were injected i.p. with 100ml of an antibody cocktail containing anti-NK1.1 (clone PK136, 40mg/mouse)
and anti-Asialo-GM1 (Poly21460, Biolegend, 35ml/mouse) one day prior and one day after tumor transplantation. For tumor growth
experiments, antibody injections were performed every 3-4 days during the course of the experiment.
Chemokine neutralization in vivo
For neutralization of CCL5 and XCL1, 50mg of anti-CCL5 and 50mg of anti-XCL1 antibodies or of isotype-matched control antibodies
were injected i.v. at the time of tumor transplantation, followed by a second injection two days later (R&D Systems; CCL5: AF478 and
MAB478; XCL1: AF486, MAB486; Isotype controls: AB-108-C, MAB006).
Processing of tumor tissue
Unless stated otherwise, tumors were excised 4 days after transplantation. Mammary tumors from female MMTV-PyMT mice were
excised when palpable. Tumor mass of individual tumors was determined using a microscale. For subsequent analysis by flow
cytometry, tumors were cut into pieces and digested with Collagenase IV (200U/ml) and DNase I (100mg/ml) for 30min at 37�C. Tissue
was passed through a 70mm cell strainer (Falcon) and washed with FACS buffer (PBS with 1% FCS and 2mM EDTA) before proceed-
ing with antibody mediated staining. For protein/chemokine analyses, tumors were placed in protein lysis buffer (PBS with Aprotinin,
Leupeptin and Pepstatin (all 10mg/ml)) and homogenized using a TissueLyser II (QIAGEN). For RNA isolation, homogenization was
performed in RLT buffer (QIAGEN).
Chemokine analyses
Total protein content of tumor lysates was quantified by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Profiling of intra-
tumoral chemokines was done for 500mg protein from tumor lysates using the Mouse Chemokine Array Kit (R&D Systems) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Signal was revealed by SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher
Scientific); and signal of individual chemokine spots was quantified using ImageJ software. Quantification of chemokines in tumor
lysates or from cell culture supernatants was done by flow cytometry using the Cytometric Bead Array (CBA, BD Biosciences).
Detection of XCL1 protein in cell culture supernatants was done by ELISA (R&D Systems). Note that the lack of sensitivity of this
ELISA precluded analysis of XCL1 protein in tumor extracts.
Dendritic cell migration assays
Chemotaxis of cDC1 was analyzed in transwell migration assays. 5x105 DCs were taken up in RPMI/1% BSA and placed into
5mm pore size transwell inserts (Corning), which were placed into wells of a tissue culture plate containing 500ml RPMI/1% BSA ±
100ng/ml CCL5 (R&D) or 150ng/ml XCL1 (R&D). After incubation at 37�C for 2h, cells in the lower compartment were harvested
and quantified by flow cytometry. Migration was calculates as % live cells in bottom well relative to input.

 NK cell stimulation assays
NK cells were purified from spleens or Ptgs1/Ptgs2�/� BRAFV600E tumors of wild-type C57BL/6J mice by negative selection using the
NK Cell Isolation Kit II (Miltenyi Biotec). NK cells were cultured at 37�C in medium containing either 200U/ml recombinant IL-2, 5ng/ml
IL-15 or 5ng/ml IL-15:IL-15Ra complexes (Invitrogen) for 16h. To assess chemokine production, NK cells were stimulated with plate-
bound anti-NK1.1 antibody (PK136) for 16h. Where indicated, 1-100ng/ml PGE2 (Sigma) was added to the in vitro culture.
Flow cytometry and fluorescence activated cell sorting
Flow cytometric analyses were performed using an LSR Fortessa, LSR Fortessa X20 or FACSymphony (BD Biosciences). Data were
analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star). DAPI (0.5 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) or a Live/Dead fixable cell stain kit (Invitrogen) was used to
exclude dead cells in all experiments, and anti-CD16/CD32 antibody (2.4G2) was used to block non-specific binding of antibodies
via Fc receptors. The following antibodies were used for flow cytometry: anti-CD3ε (clone 17A2), anti-CD4 (RMA4.5), anti-CD8a
(53-6.7), anti-CD8b (53-5.8), anti-CD11b (M1/70), anti-CD11c (N418), anti-CD16/CD32 (2.4G2), anti-CD24 (M1/69), anti-CD45.2
(104), anti-CD49a (HMa1), anti-CD49b (DX5) anti-CD64 (X54-5/7.1) anti-CD103 (M290), anti–Clec9a/DNGR-1 (1F6), anti-CCL5
(2E9/CCL5), anti–MHC class II (MHC II) I-a/I-E (M5/114.15.2), anti-NK1.1 (PK136), anti-PD-1 (29F.1A12), anti-TCRb (H57-597),
anti-TCRgd (GL3), anti-TIM-3 (RMT3-23) and anti-XCR1 (ZET). Detection of cell death was done using the Annexin V Apoptosis
Detection Kit with PI (Biolegend) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. NK cells were identified as live CD45+NK1.1+CD49b+
CD3�MHCII� cells. CD103+ cDC1 were identified as live CD45+CD103+CD11b�CD11c+MHCII+ cells. Quantification of total cell
numbers by flow cytometry was done using fluorescent beads (Beckman Coulter). For intracellular staining of CCL5 ex vivo, tu-
mor-bearing mice were injected with brefeldin A (10mg/kg body weight) i.v. and tumors were collected 6h later. Tumor processing
was done in presence of brefeldin A (5mg/ml) and cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10min at room temperature. Detection
of intracellular mRNA encoding for XCL1 was done by PrimeFlow RNA Assay (Affymetrics and Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a type 1
probe according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Intracellular staining was performed in permeabilization buffer (eBioscience) for
30min and cells were subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry. Staining of intracellular IRF8 (V3GYWCH) or Granzyme B (anti-
human, cross-reactive with mouse, clone GB11) was done using the Foxp3/Transcription factor staining buffer set from eBioscience.
All antibodies were purchased from Biolegend, BD Biosciences or eBioscience except for anti-DNGR-1, which was produced
in house. Sorting of tumor cells after retroviral transduction was done using a BD FACSAria or a BD FACSAria Fusion. Purity of
cell populations was determined by reanalysis of a fraction of sorted cell samples.
Immunofluorescence Imaging
Tumors were fixed in Antigenfix solution (Diapath). Samples were dehydrated in 30% sucrose prior to embedding in TissueTek OCT
freezing medium (Sakura Finetek) and stored at �80 C. 30mm sections were permeabilized, blocked, and stained in 0.1M Tris
(AppliChem) supplemented with 1% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100 (Gerbu Biotechnik) and normal mouse serum (Life Technologies). Serial
tumor sections were prepared and visually inspected by epifluorescence light microscopy before acquisition of representative areas
by confocal microscopy. Staining used the following antibodies: anti-CD31 (clone Mec13.3; Biolegend), anti-CD103 (goat polyclonal;
R&D Systems), anti-Collagen IV (rabbit polyclonal; Abcam), anti-NK1.1 (PK136; BD Biosciences), anti-MHC class II (MHCII) I-A/I-E
(M5/114.15.2; BD Biosciences). Stained sections were mounted in Mowiol and analyzed on a LSM 710 or LSM 780 confocal micro-
scope (Zeiss). Image analysis was performed using Imaris software (Bitplane) on maximum projections of 7-10 Z-plane sections.
Semi-automated analyses using the Imaris surface generation tool was used to reconstruct surfaces for CD103+ cDC1,
CD103�MHCII+ cells, NK cells and CD31+ blood vessels. To calculate the distance of cells to the tumor margin, a surface outlining
the margin of the tumor was generated based on Collagen IV staining. Automated quantification of the minimal distances between
individual cells, of cells to CD31+ blood vessels or the tumor margin was done using the Imaris distance transformation tool.
Cloning of retroviral vectors for XCL1 and CCL5 expression
NK cells were isolated from spleen of C57BL/6 WT mice and NK cell mRNA was purified using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Total cDNA
was prepared by reverse transcription and DNA was then amplified using the following primers: XCL1-Forward (BamHI) 50-GGCCCG
GGGATCCATGGATGAGACTTCTCCTCCT-30 and XCL1-Reverse (XhoI) 50-CGGCCAACCGGCTCGAGTTACCCAGTCAGGGTTA-30
for XCL1; CCL5-Forward (BamHI) 50-GGCCCGGGGATCCATGGATGAAGATCTCTGCAG-30 and CCL5-Reverse (XhoI) 50-CGGCCA
ACCGGCTCGAGCTAGCTCATCTCCAAATA-30 for CCL5. Both PCR products and the target vector pMSCV-IRES-mCherry (Addg-
ene #52114) were then digested with XhoI and BamHI for 1h at 37�C and purified by gel extraction after agarose gel electrophoresis.
Ligation was performed for 1h at room temperature using T4 DNA ligase (NEB). The ligation mix was then transformed into One Shot
TOP10 chemically competent bacteria (Thermo Fischer Scientific) and plated on ampicillin containing LB-agar plates. Single colonies
were then sequenced and used for plasmid isolation using the High speed Maxi Kit (QIAGEN).
Retroviral transduction
GP2-293 packaging cells were transfected with a mixture of GeneJuice (Novagen), VSV-G envelope protein-coding plasmid, and a
pMSCV-IRES-mCherry plasmid coding for the desired protein or empty as control. On three consecutive days post-transfection, the
pseudotyped virus-containing culture medium was harvested, filtered, supplemented with 8 mg/ml polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich), and
immediately applied to target cells for spinfection by centrifugation (90min, 2500xg at room temperature). After the incubation,
Cell 172, 1022–1037.e1–e5, February 22, 2018
e4
 the medium was exchanged for fresh complete RPMI1640 medium. Target cells were passaged at least three times after retroviral
transduction and analyzed for mCherry expression as a read out for transduction efficiency. Where necessary, cells were FACS-
sorted based on mCherry expression to ensure equal levels of transduction between different cell lines.
RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR
RNA was isolated using QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kit and cDNA was synthesized using the Superscript II reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was performed using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Invitrogen) accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions on an QuantStudio (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the relative standard curve method. The
PCR conditions were 2min at 50�C, 10min at 95�C followed by 40 2-step cycles of 15 s at 95�C and 1 min at 60�C. Primers for
XCL1 (Xcl1-Forward 50-CTTTCCTGGGAGTCTGCTGC-30 and Xcl1-Reverse 50-CAGCCGCTGGGTTTGTAAGT-30) and HPRT
(HPRT-Forward 50-TCAGTCAACGGGGGACATAAA-30 and HPRT-Reverse 50-GGGGCTGTACTGCT-30 TAACCAG) as normalization
control were used to assess relative gene expression.
Analysis of gene expression data
Publically available datasets were downloaded from gene expression omnibus (GEO, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Affyme-
trix arrays were normalized using RMA. Illumina arrays were quantile normalized and log2 transformed. All data from expression ar-
rays were processed within R. Data from the following gene expression datasets were used in this paper: GSE15907, GSE24759,
GSE77671. For analyses of chemokines expressed by NK cells (GSE15907), analyses were restricted to probes with expression
values above the standard post-normalization threshold of 120 indicating expression above background.
Bioinformatic analysis of cancer patient data
RSEM normalized expression datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were downloaded from Firehose (https://gdac.
broadinstitute.org/). Hierarchical clustering of expression data was plotted as heatmaps using the ‘gplots’ package (version
3.0.1), where red indicates higher and blue indicates lower expression relative to the mean expression per gene. For generation
of gene expression signatures, normalized expression values were log2-transformed and ranked by the mean expression value of
signature genes. The following gene signatures were used: chemokines (XCL1, XCL2, CCL5), NK cells (NCR1, NCR3, KLRB1,
CD160, PRF1), cDC1 (CLEC9A, XCR1, CLNK, BATF3) and CD8 T cells (CD8A, CD8B, CD3E). Overall survival analyses were per-
formed for the top and bottom quartile expression ranked values for selected genes or the ranked sum expression of gene signature
and plotted for Kaplan-Meier curves using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad). Gene signature analyses for another cohort of breast cancer
(including TNBC) patients were done using the KM plotter software (http://kmplot.com) (Sza
´ sz et al., 2016).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad). Statistical significance was determined using an
unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test. Statistical analyses for three or more groups and tumor growth profiles were done by ANOVA.
Correlation analyses were performed using Pearson correlation. The log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was used to determine statistical
significance for overall survival in cancer patient data from TCGA. Data are shown as mean ± SD or mean ± SEM as indicated in
the figure legends. Significance was assumed with *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.

Figure S7. Prognostic Value of Chemokine Expression for Overall Survival, Related to Figure 7
(A and B) Survival analyses of a human breast cancer patient cohort with associated gene expression data available at the KM plotter site (http://kmplot.com). All
breast cancer patients from the dataset or a sub-group of patients diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) were split into the top and bottom half for
expression of signature genes and compared for overall survival. (A) Prognostic value of a cDC1 signature (CLNK, BATF3, XCR1) for all breast cancer patients
(n = 1764) or TNBC patients (n = 161). Please note that CLEC9A transcript is absent in this particular dataset and cannot be included in the signature.
(B) Prognostic value of a NK cell signature (NCR1, NCR3, KLRB1, CD160, PRF1) for all breast cancer patients (n = 3951) or patients with TNBC (n = 255).
(C) Prognostic value of CD68 expression levels in tumor biopsies for overall survival of human cancer patients from TCGA datasets.
(D and E) Prognostic value of a chemokine signature (XCL1, XCL2 and CCL5) for overall survival of human cancer patients from (D) TCGA datasets as indicated or
(E) human breast cancer patients available at the KM plotter site. p = p value, n = number of data points in the analysis.
