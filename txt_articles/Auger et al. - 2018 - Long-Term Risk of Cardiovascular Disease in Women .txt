BACKGROUND: The possibility that congenital heart defects signal a 
familial predisposition to cardiovascular disease has not been investigated. 
We aimed to determine whether the risk of cardiovascular disorders later 
in life was higher for women who have had newborns with congenital 
heart defects.
METHODS: We studied a cohort of 1 
084 
251 women who had delivered 
infants between 1989 and 2013 in Quebec, Canada. We identified 
women whose infants had critical, noncritical, or no heart defects, and 
tracked the women over time for future hospitalizations for cardiovascular 
disease, with follow-up extending up to 25 years past pregnancy. We 
calculated the incidence of cardiovascular hospitalization per 1000 
person-years, and used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate 
hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association 
between infant heart defects and risk of maternal cardiovascular 
hospitalization. Models were adjusted for age, parity, preeclampsia, 
comorbidity, material deprivation, and time period.
RESULTS: Women whose infants had heart defects had a higher overall 
incidence of cardiovascular hospitalization. There were 3.38 cardiovascular 
hospitalizations per 1000 person-years for those with critical defects 
(95% CI, 2.67–4.27), 3.19 for noncritical defects (95% CI, 2.96–3.45), 
and 2.42 for no heart defects (95% CI, 2.39–2.44). In comparison with 
no heart defects, women whose infants had critical defects had a hazard 
ratio of 1.43 (95% CI, 1.13–1.82) for any cardiovascular hospitalization, 
and women whose infants had noncritical defects had a hazard ratio of 
1.24 (95% CI, 1.15–1.34), in adjusted models. Risks of specific causes 
of cardiovascular hospitalization, including myocardial infarction, heart 
failure, and other atherosclerotic disorders, were also greater for mothers 
of infants with congenital heart defects than with no defects.
CONCLUSIONS: Women whose infants have congenital heart defects 
have a greater risk of cardiovascular hospitalization later in life. Congenital 
heart defects in offspring may be an early marker of predisposition to 
cardiovascular disease.

ardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death 
in women,1 killing >2 million worldwide in 2013 
alone.2 However, early life risk factors for cardio-
vascular disease are not well understood. Some studies 
report associations with prior pregnancy disorders,3,4 
and recently, longitudinal data suggest that women 
whose offspring have congenital anomalies may have 
a 26% greater risk of cardiovascular mortality later in 
life.5 Factors such as stress from caregiving are thought 
to contribute to the association,5 but the impact of spe-
cific congenital anomalies on cardiovascular disease risk 
has yet to be studied.
Heart defects are a particularly promising subset 
of congenital anomalies for their potential to explain 
the relationship between infant anomalies and sub-
sequent maternal cardiovascular disease. Congenital 
heart defects are the most common type of birth de-
fect with a worldwide prevalence of ≈7.7 per 1000 
live births.6 Moreover, adult cardiovascular disease 
and congenital heart defects share common risk fac-
tors. Diabetes mellitus, obesity, and preeclampsia, 
for example, are strongly related to both congenital 
heart defects in offspring and maternal cardiovascular 
disease.4,7–9 Congenital heart defects may also reflect 
a familial genetic predisposition to cardiovascular 
pathology.10,11 Caring for infants with critical heart 
defects is associated with psychosocial and financial 
stress,12,13 which may increase the risk of maternal 
cardiovascular disease in the long term.14 Despite 
supportive evidence for a link between congenital 
heart defects in infants and maternal cardiovascular 
risk, the association between the 2 has yet to be stud-
ied. We therefore assessed the long-term risk of car-
diovascular disease in women whose newborns had 
heart defects.
METHODS
Data
This study included all women who delivered at least 1 live birth 
in hospitals in the province of Quebec, Canada between 1989 
and 2013. In Quebec, 99% of deliveries occur in hospital.15 Using 
encrypted health insurance numbers, we followed the cohort 
longitudinally over time beginning at the first delivery to iden-
tify any cardiovascular hospitalizations thereafter. There were 
3 possible reasons for ending follow-up: (1) hospitalization for 
a cardiovascular disorder or procedure; (2) death; or (3) end of 
study on March 31, 2014. We extracted the data from discharge 
abstracts in the Maintenance and Use of Data for the Study of 
Hospital Clientele registry, which contains summary abstracts for 
all hospitalizations in Quebec.16 The data, analytic methods, and 
study materials will not be made available to other researchers 
for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the proce-
dure but can be obtained from the Ministry of Health of Social 
Services following standard procedures for access.
For each admission, we had information on up to 26 diagnos-
tic and 20 procedural codes, and data on admission to a coronary 
care unit or death during hospitalization, as well. We excluded 
women without health insurance numbers because they could 
not be followed longitudinally, and 22 
734 women with preexist-
ing cardiovascular disease or congenital heart defects. Similarly, 
we excluded women who only had stillbirths. Data on heart 
defects in fetuses who were stillborn are not collected in Quebec.
Heart Defects
We identified all neonates who had heart defects docu-
mented on their discharge summary using diagnostic codes 
of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth 
Revisions, and procedure codes of the Canadian Classification 
of Diagnostic, Therapeutic, and Surgical Procedures and the 
Canadian Classification of Health Interventions (Table I in the 
online-only Data Supplement). We categorized heart defects 
according to severity, including critical and noncritical. We 
defined critical heart defects as those requiring attention 
shortly after delivery to prevent sequelae in infants, in con-
trast to noncritical defects where treatment may be delayed 
or not required.17 We included 7 critical anomalies (tetralogy 
of Fallot; transposition of the great vessels; truncus arteriosus; 
hypoplastic left heart syndrome; common ventricle; coarctation 
of the aorta; other critical defects including total anomalous 
pulmonary venous return, Ebstein anomaly, tricuspid and pul-
monary atresia), and 8 noncritical anomalies (endocardial cush-
ion defect; ventricular septum defect; atrial septum defect; 
valve anomaly; other anomalies of the aorta; pulmonary artery 
anomalies; heterotaxy; other remaining noncritical defects).4
Women who delivered ≥1 neonate with a heart defect 
were ascertained by linking the maternal discharge abstract 
to the neonatal abstract. The exposure was categorized as fol-
lows: (1) women who delivered at least 1 neonate with a criti-
cal heart defect; (2) women who delivered at least 1 neonate 
with a noncritical defect, but none with a critical defect; and 
(3) women whose neonates were all free of any heart defect. 
For analyses of specific defects in women whose infants 
had both critical and noncritical defects, only critical defects 
were considered (critical defects were given priority). Women 
whose infants had multiple exclusively critical or noncritical 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• This longitudinal cohort analysis of >1 million 
women is the first to show that congenital heart 
defects in offspring are associated with increased 
risk of maternal cardiovascular morbidity later in 
life, including atherosclerotic disease, cardiac hos-
pitalization, and cardiac transplantation.
• The association with subsequent cardiovascular 
morbidity risk is present for both critical and non-
critical congenital heart defects.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Women who have given birth to offspring with 
congenital heart defects may benefit from earlier 
attention to traditional cardiovascular risk factors 
and more aggressive primary prevention strategies.

defects were included in a separate category. We analyzed 
exposure as a time-fixed covariate on the assumption that 
the presence of a heart defect at a later pregnancy reflects a 
maternal predisposition to cardiovascular disease that would 
have been present from the time of the first live birth.
Cardiovascular Hospitalization After 
Pregnancy
We used diagnostic and procedure codes to identify all women 
who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of a cardiovascular dis-
order, or who underwent a cardiovascular procedure during 
follow-up (Table II in the online-only Data Supplement). We 
analyzed the first event of cardiovascular disease. We ana-
lyzed a range of maternal cardiovascular disorders, focusing 
on the heart (heart failure, ischemic heart disease, myocardial 
infarction, angina, cardiac arrest, inflammatory heart disorder, 
conduction disorder, valve disorder, cardiomyopathy), lungs 
(pulmonary embolism, pulmonary vascular disease), cerebro-
vascular system (ischemic stroke, hemorrhage), and other 
specific diseases including hypertension, other atherosclerotic 
disease, aortic aneurysm or dissection, aneurysm of other ves-
sels, deep vein thrombosis, and arterial embolism. We also 
considered several cardiovascular interventions, including cor-
onary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass grafting, pacemaker 
insertion, valve surgery, cardiac transplant, and admission to a 
coronary care unit. Women with >1 cardiovascular diagnosis 
were included in each outcome category.
Covariates
We considered several covariates as potential confounders, 
including maternal age at first delivery (<20, 20–24, 25–29, 
30–34, 35–39, ≥40 years), total parity (1, 2, ≥3 deliveries), 
preeclampsia (yes, no), comorbidity during pregnancy or 
subsequent admissions (obesity, diabetes mellitus, dyslipid-
emia, depression), material deprivation defined as the most 
socioeconomically deprived quintile of neighborhoods (yes, 
no), and the time period at first delivery (1989–1996, 1997–
2004, 2005–2012). We analyzed comorbidity as a time-fixed 
covariate using a global metric (any versus no comorbidity). 
Socioeconomic deprivation was estimated from census data 
on employment rate, proportion of population with no high 
school diploma, and mean neighborhood income.4,18 Data on 
material deprivation were missing for 6.2% of women, which 
we imputed based on maternal age, parity, preeclampsia, 
comorbidity, and period at first delivery.
Data Analysis
We estimated the incidence of cardiovascular hospitalization 
per 1000 person-years. We calculated the cumulative incidence 
after 25 years of follow-up for women who had critical, non-
critical, or no heart defects in their offspring. To account for 
death as a competing outcome, we estimated the cumulative 
incidence using the cumulative incidence function.19 The cumu-
lative incidence function does not censor deaths, but rather 
handles them as a competing event.19 We computed 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) using the counting process method.20
Using accelerated failure time models with a Weibull 
distribution, we estimated the median number of years 
required to reach a cumulative incidence of 5 cardiovascular 
hospitalizations per 10 
000 women. The Weibull distribution 
assumes proportional hazards and coincides with the Cox 
model.21 We computed the median time using each patient’s 
estimated survival time from the model.21 We adjusted these 
models for maternal age at first delivery, parity, preeclampsia, 
comorbidity, material deprivation, and time period.
Using Cox proportional hazards regression, we calculated 
hazard ratios and 95% CIs for the association between con-
genital heart defects in offspring and subsequent risk of mater-
nal cardiovascular hospitalization. We adjusted these models 
for the same set of covariates, and assessed the proportional 
hazards assumption using log (–log survival) plots. We used the 
number of days since the first delivery as the time scale and 
censored women if they were never hospitalized for cardiovas-
cular issues by the end of the study. We used the Fine and Gray 
method to handle deaths, a competing risk.20 Analyses were 
performed for each cardiovascular indication separately, and 
for all cardiovascular hospitalizations combined, as well.
We tested models with the exposure as a time-varying 
covariate, in the event that mechanisms linking infant heart 
defects with maternal cardiovascular disease began only at 
the first affected pregnancy. In time-varying models, women 
contribute follow-up to the unexposed category until the 
first pregnancy affected by heart defects.22 Because the large 
sample size prevented convergence of time-varying models, 
we performed a subsample analysis comprising all women 
whose infants had heart defects and a 1:3 random sample 
of women without defects. The subsample comprised 65 
600 
women, including 16 
400 whose infants had heart defects. 
Because long interpregnancy intervals are rare in Quebec, the 
time contributed to the exposed category in the time-varying 
analysis is very similar to the time in the time-fixed analysis.
In sensitivity analyses, we included 1505 women who only 
had stillbirths, assuming different scenarios: (1) all stillbirths had 
critical defects; (2) all stillbirths had noncritical defects; (3) 5% of 
stillbirths had critical defects, 20% had noncritical defects, and 
75% had no heart defects; and (4) no stillbirths had heart defects. 
We also restricted the analysis to women without preeclampsia.
We performed the analyses with SAS version 9.4 (SAS 
Institute Inc). The study abided by ethical requirements for 
research involving humans in Canada, and we obtained 
an ethics waiver from the institutional review board of the 
University of Montreal Hospital Center. Informed consent was 
not required.
RESULTS
There were 1 
084 
251 women in this study, including 
1516 with critical and 14 
884 with noncritical heart de-
fects in the offspring (Table 1). The incidence of cardio-
vascular hospitalization was higher for women whose 
infants had heart defects (Table 2). There were 3.38 car-
diovascular hospitalizations per 1000 person-years for 
critical defects (95% CI, 2.67–4.27), 3.19 for noncriti-
cal defects (95% CI, 2.96–3.45), and 2.42 for no heart 
defects (95% CI, 2.39–2.44).
In comparison with no heart defects, women whose 
offspring had critical or noncritical heart defects tended 
to be hospitalized earlier for most cardiovascular diseas-

es (Table 3). For myocardial infarction, women whose 
infants had critical defects required a median of 7.2 
years to attain 5 hospitalizations per 10 000, whereas 
women whose offspring had no heart defects required 
9.8 years. Similarly, women whose infants had critical, 
noncritical, or no congenital heart defects required 
a median of 16.8, 15.2, and 22.0 years, respectively, 
to attain 5 cardiac arrests per 10 
000. Although this 
pattern was observed for most types of cardiovascu-
lar hospitalizations, the median time to various cardio-
vascular hospitalizations was not significantly different 
between women who had children with critical and 
noncritical defects.
The cumulative incidence of cardiovascular hospi-
talization began to diverge shortly after pregnancy for 
several outcomes (Figure). For women whose offspring 
had critical heart defects, the incidence of heart fail-
ure, myocardial infarction, and coronary angioplasty 
increased more rapidly after 10 years of follow-up in 
comparison with women whose infants had no heart 
defects, whereas the incidence of valve surgery ac-
celerated after 18 years of follow-up. With noncritical 
defects, the increase in cardiovascular hospitalizations 
was generally steady over time.
Even after adjustment, having an offspring with a con-
genital heart defect was associated with a greater risk 
of cardiovascular hospitalization in comparison with no 
heart defects (Table 4). In comparison with no heart de-
fects, women whose infants had critical defects had 1.43 
times the risk of any cardiovascular hospitalization (95% 
CI, 1.13–1.82; P=0.003), and women whose infants 
had noncritical defects had 1.24 times the risk (95% CI, 
1.15–1.34; P<0.0001). Specific causes of cardiovascular 
hospitalization were also greater for mothers of infants 
with congenital heart defects in comparison with no de-
fects. Women whose infants had critical heart defects, 
for instance, had 2.61 times the risk of myocardial in-
farction (95% CI, 1.31–5.20; P=0.007), 3.04 times the 
risk of other atherosclerotic disease (95% CI, 1.72–5.36; 
P=0.0001), and 43.2 times the risk of cardiac transplant 
(95% CI, 6.41–291.7; P=0.0001). Women whose infants 
had noncritical defects had 2.08 times the risk of heart 
failure (95% CI, 1.53–2.82; P<0.0001), 2.52 times the 
risk of pulmonary vascular disease (95% CI, 1.54–4.11; 
P=0.0002), and 2.13 times the risk of pacemaker inser-
tion (95% CI, 1.29–3.52; P=0.003). Associations were 
sometimes stronger for critical than for noncritical heart 
defects, although there was no statistically significant 
difference between the groups. There was no evidence 
of interaction with age at first delivery, total parity, pre-
eclampsia, comorbidity, and material deprivation.
Results were similar when we tested models with the 
exposure as a time-varying covariate, although statis-
tical power was lower because of the smaller sample 
size (Table 5). In time-varying models, women whose 
infants had critical heart defects had 1.34 times the risk 
of any cardiovascular disease (95% CI, 1.03–1.75), and 
women whose infants had noncritical heart defects had 
1.33 times the risk (95% CI, 1.21–1.47).
The risk of maternal cardiovascular hospitalization 
also varied depending on the specific heart defect in 
the infant (Table 6). Relative to no heart defect, women 
whose infants had tetralogy of Fallot had 1.49 times 
the risk of any cardiovascular hospitalization (95% CI, 
0.95–2.34), and women whose infants had hypoplastic 
left heart had 2.24 times the risk (95% CI, 1.27–3.96). 
Risks were also elevated for several noncritical defects. 
Relative to no heart defect, women whose infants had 
noncritical pulmonary artery defects had 1.66 times 
the risk of any cardiovascular hospitalization (95% CI, 
1.27–2.17), and women whose infants had noncritical 
heterotaxy defects had 2.42 times the risk (95% CI, 
1.15–5.08). Women whose infants had noncritical ven-

tricular septum defects had 1.17 times the risk (95% 
CI, 1.00–1.37) and those with atrial septum defects 
had 1.21 times the risk (95% CI, 1.04–1.42) of any 
cardiovascular hospitalization. Women whose infants 
had multiple noncritical defects had 1.26 times the risk 
(95% CI, 1.04–1.54) of any cardiovascular hospitaliza-
tion. The risk was also higher for women whose infants 
had multiple critical defects, but the association was 
not statistically significant (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 
0.37–3.74). There was no evidence of statistically sig-
nificant differences between specific defects.
We found little or no change in the findings when 
women who only had stillbirths were included in analy-
ses. Excluding women with preeclampsia led to random 
variation in the results, and wider CIs for critical heart 
defects because of the smaller number of exposed 
women (Table III in the online-only Data Supplement). 
Nonpreeclamptic women whose infants had critical 
heart defects, for instance, had 1.29 times the risk of 
any cardiovascular disorder or intervention (95% CI, 
0.98–1.69), 2.64 times the risk of myocardial infarc-
tion (95% CI, 1.26–5.50), and 43.23 times the risk of 
cardiac transplant (95% CI, 6.41–291.73). Associa-
tions were more stable for noncritical defects. Nonpre-
eclamptic women whose infants had noncritical defects 
had 1.24 times the risk of any cardiovascular disorder or 
intervention (95% CI, 1.14–1.35), 2.04 times the risk of 
heart failure (95% CI, 1.44–2.89), and 2.31 times the 
risk of pacemaker insertion (95% CI, 1.38–3.88).

associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular dis-
ease later in life. Women whose offspring had critical or 
noncritical heart defects were hospitalized for cardio-
vascular disease sooner, and the risks were greater for 
most types of cardiovascular disorders, including isch-
emic heart disease, other atherosclerotic disease, and 
cardiac transplant. Associations were stronger for criti-
cal defects such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, but 
the majority of noncritical heart defects were also asso-
ciated with an elevated risk of cardiovascular hospital-
ization. Thus, having an infant with a congenital heart 
defect may represent a novel risk factor for developing 
cardiovascular disease. Women who have a newborn 
with a heart defect may therefore benefit from early

primary prevention and counseling to reduce their risk 
of cardiovascular disease.
Few studies have investigated the possibility that 
heart defects in offspring signal a greater propensi-
ty for heart disease in mothers. In a cohort study of 
455 250 women who delivered infants between 1979 
and 2010 in Denmark, the presence of any congenital 
anomaly in a newborn was associated with a greater 
risk of maternal mortality, including cardiovascular 
death up to 28 years later.5 In this same study, women 
whose infants had any congenital anomaly had 2 times 
the risk of death from myocardial infarction, but there 
was no association with stroke mortality.5 Although 
these results reflect congenital anomalies as a whole, 
heart defects are frequent and have the potential to 
account for much of the association with cardiovascu-
lar mortality.6 Our own results suggest that the pres-
ence of a heart defect in an infant is associated with 
the subsequent risk of hospitalization for a range of 
cardiovascular disorders, including myocardial infarc-
tion and ischemic stroke, although not all associations 
were statistically significant. Because the cohort was 
relatively young, it is possible that the association with 
late-onset cardiovascular diseases will strengthen with 
longer follow-up. It is also interesting to contrast these 
findings with a small body of evidence suggesting no 
increased risk of cancer in women whose newborns 
had congenital anomalies.23,24
How congenital heart defects in infants relate to lat-
er maternal cardiovascular disease is unclear. Because 
we found no evidence to support a clinically meaning-
ful difference in the results for the time-fixed versus 
time-varying analysis, it is possible that the relationship 
between congenital heart defects and maternal car-
diovascular risk reflects both stress-related pathways 
and a maternal predisposition to cardiovascular disease 
present from the start of the study. Imbalance in angio-
genic biomarkers such as placental growth factor and 
altered cytokine production, as well, have been linked 
with both congenital heart defects and adult cardio-
vascular disease.25–28 Congenital heart defects and adult 
cardiovascular disease share common risk factors. For 
instance, preeclampsia is associated with both heart 
defects and cardiovascular disorders later in life.4,9 Dia-
betes mellitus, and more weakly obesity, are also asso-
ciated with congenital heart defects and cardiovascular 
disease.7,8 Although we adjusted for several of these 
characteristics, it is possible that other behavioral or 
lifestyle factors, such as nutrition or smoking, mediate 
some of the associations independent of overt comor-
bidities. A genetic component cannot be excluded.
Furthermore, mothers of infants with heart defects 
have a high risk of stress, anxiety, and depression.12 This 
is especially the case for severe heart defects that of-
ten involve repeated and costly hospitalizations.13 With

tive incidence in women whose infants have heart defects. Table IV in the online-only Data Supplement shows the number of

adolescence,29 the psychosocial impact of congenital 
heart disease on caregivers may not be benign and may 
have a cumulative effect over the long term. We ad-
justed for depression in this analysis, but other stressors 
may explain some of the increased risk of cardiovascu-
lar disease in mothers.14
A number of limitations of the current analysis de-
serve discussion. First, we could only identify heart 
defects in infants who were born alive. Congenital de-
fects in pregnancies that resulted in elective termina-
tion, miscarriage, or stillbirth were not considered. In 
addition, only heart defects identified at delivery were 
identifiable in our database. Defects discovered later in 
childhood were therefore not included. Similarly, the 
data set did not allow us to distinguish noncritical per-
sistent defects from more benign findings that could be 
expected to resolve with maturity.29 Thus, some women 
might be misclassified in terms of their exposure status.

ORIGINAL RESEARCH 
ARTICLE
extend past menopause, thus excluding the highest 
risk period for cardiovascular disease.30 The analysis 
may have therefore been underpowered to detect as-
sociations with outcomes that were rare, and future 
studies with longer follow-up are needed. Analyses of 
recurrent cardiovascular events may also be merited, 
because this study stopped follow-up at the first car-
diovascular hospitalization. We did not find evidence 
of interaction with preeclampsia, suggesting that 
preeclampsia is not a modifier. Nonetheless, future 
research using larger sample sizes may be useful to 
determine if effects differ depending on the presence 
of preeclampsia. We lacked information on risk factors 
such as smoking, body mass index, and ethnicity, and 
residual confounding cannot be excluded, making this 
an important limitation.
In this longitudinal study, women whose infants had 
critical or noncritical heart defects had >25% greater 
risk of any cardiovascular hospitalization later in life. As-
sociations were stronger for many outcomes, and were 
present with both critical and noncritical heart defects. 
The presence of a heart defect in a woman’s offspring 
may therefore be a novel risk factor for the develop-
ment of maternal cardiovascular disease. More study 
is needed to determine if women whose infants with 
heart defects could benefit from targeted primary pre-
vention initiatives.
