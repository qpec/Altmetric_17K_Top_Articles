Abstract: Liver cancer is highly fatal, and death rates in the United States are
increasing faster than for any other cancer, having doubled since the mid-1980s.
In 2017, it is estimated that the disease will account for about 41,000 new cancer
cases and 29,000 cancer deaths in the United States. In this article, data from the
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program and the National Cen-
ter for Health Statistics are used to provide an overview of liver cancer incidence,
mortality, and survival rates and trends, including data by race/ethnicity and state.
The prevalence of major risk factors for liver cancer is also reported based on
national survey data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Despite
the improvement in liver cancer survival in recent decades, only 1 in 5 patients
survives 5 years after diagnosis. There is substantial disparity in liver cancer death
rates by race/ethnicity (from 5.5 per 100,000 in non-Hispanic whites to 11.9 per
100,000 in American Indians/Alaska Natives) and state (from 3.8 per 100,000 in
North Dakota to 9.6 per 100,000 in the District of Columbia) and by race/ethnicity
within states. Differences in risk factor prevalence account for much of the
observed variation in liver cancer rates. Thus, in contrast to the growing burden, a
substantial proportion of liver cancer deaths could be averted, and existing dispar-
ities could be dramatically reduced, through the targeted application of existing
knowledge in prevention, early detection, and treatment, including improvements
in vaccination against hepatitis B virus, screening and treatment for chronic hepati-
tis C virus infections, maintaining a healthy body weight, access to high-quality dia-
betes care, preventing excessive alcohol drinking, and tobacco control, at both the
state and national levels. CA Cancer J Clin 2017;67:273-289. V

Introduction
Liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancer (hereafter liver cancer) is the fifth and eighth
leading cause of cancer death in men and women, respectively, accounting for
approximately 41,000 cancer cases and 29,000 deaths in the United States in 2017.1
Liver cancer death rates are increasing at a faster pace than any other cancer.2,3 An
average 19 years of life are lost per death because of a relatively young median age
at diagnosis (63 years) and a high fatality rate.2 Liver cancer incidence has been ris-
ing in the United States since at least the mid-1970s,2,4 a trend that is projected to
continue through at least 2030.5 A major factor contributing to this increase is the
comparatively high prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among those
born during 1945 through 1965, also called “baby boomers.”2,6 The sustained rise
in obesity and type II diabetes over the past several decades has also likely contrib-
uted to the increasing liver cancer trend.7
The incidence of liver cancer varies by race/ethnicity and state, mainly because of
differences in the prevalence of major risk factors and, to some degree, because of
disparities in access to high-quality care.1,2,8 However, there is limited information
on contemporary liver cancer mortality and survival rates in the United States,

 particularly by race/ethnicity. Recently, the Annual Report to
the Nation on the Status of Cancer series (hereafter the Annual
Report) featured liver cancer incidence rates and trends but
provided limited information on mortality.2,3 A small num-
ber of other studies that examined liver cancer mortality
and/or survival in the United States did not report death
rates by either state9,10 or race/ethnicity.3,11
In this report, we examine trends in liver cancer inci-
dence, survival, and mortality in the United States and pro-
vide contemporary state-level death rates for 5 broad racial
and ethnic groups. State-level statistics are particularly
important, as they can inform state cancer-control planning,
early detection, and prevention efforts. By using data from a
population-based subset of the United States, we also
describe disparities in survival rates and trends by race/eth-
nicity and stage. Prevalence and trends in major risk factors
for liver cancer, as well as interventions to prevent or miti-
gate their burden, are also reviewed in detail.
Materials and Methods
US mortality data from 1990 through 2014 were obtained
from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as
provided through the National Cancer Institute’s Surveil-
lance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program.12
These data were the source for long-term death rate trends
and cross-sectional 5-year rates.
Initially, we used long-term survival data (1975-2012)
from the 9 oldest SEER registries (Connecticut, Hawaii,
Iowa, New Mexico, and Utah, and the metropolitan areas
of Atlanta, Detroit, San-Francisco/Oakland, and Seattle-
Puget Sound [SEER 9]) to examine relative survival trends
by stage at diagnosis and by race (white, black, and other
races combined). However, because there was no substantial
change in relative survival for any stage or race in the 1970s
and 1980s (data not shown), we used data from SEER 13
(the SEER 9 registries plus rural Georgia, the Alaska
Native Tumor Registry, and the metropolitan areas of Los
Angeles and San Jose/Monterey) to examine trends in
cause-specific survival (hereafter cancer-specific survival) from
1992 to 2012 by race/ethnicity.13 Data from all 18 SEER
registries (SEER 13 plus Louisiana, Kentucky, New Jersey,
and the remainder of California and Georgia [SEER 18])
provide coverage for 28% of the US population and were
used to calculate contemporary (2006-2012) stage distribu-
tion and 5-year cancer-specific survival.
Population-based liver cancer incidence data were also
obtained to provide additional context for the select mortal-
ity statistics presented herein. The North American Associ-
ation of Central Cancer Registries, which compiles data
from registries participating in SEER and/or the CDC’s
National Program of Cancer Registries, was the source for
5-year incidence rates (2009-2013),14 while the SEER 13
registries were the source for long-term incidence trends
(1992-2013).13
Liver cancer cases and deaths were classified according to
the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, third
edition, and the International Classification of Diseases, 10th
revision
(codes
C22.0-C22.1),
respectively.15,16
Age-
adjusted rates per 100,000 were calculated using SEER*Stat
software, version 8.3.2.0.17 SEER 13 incidence rates were
adjusted for reporting delays using registry-specific factors
available in SEER*Stat, with the exception of rates for
American Indians/Alaska Natives (AIs/ANs), which were
adjusted using combined US registry delay factors provided
by the National Cancer Institute.3 Delay adjustment, which
has the greatest impact on the most recent data years,
accounts for future corrections to currently available cancer
incidence data, thus providing a more accurate depiction of
contemporary incidence trends.18 Joinpoint regression anal-
ysis was used to model and quantify trends in the observed
death rates overall and by race/ethnicity.19 Trends in inci-
dence and death rates by race/ethnicity are shown with
smoothed lines, which were fitted using locally weighted
regression curves (the LOWESS command in Stata soft-
ware, version 13),20 in which 30% of the data were used in
the smoothing.
The broad racial groups used throughout our analysis of
cancer occurrence exclude Hispanic ethnicity for whites
(hereafter non-Hispanic [NH] whites), blacks, Asian/Pacific
Islanders (APIs), and AIs/ANs. Long-term death rate
trends (1990-2014) by race/ethnicity exclude deaths from
Louisiana, New Hampshire, and Oklahoma, because these
states did not report data on Hispanic ethnicity for one or
more years during the study period. To avoid underascer-
tainment of AI/AN ethnicity in areas with a low percentage
AI/AN population, results for AIs/ANs are based on data
from Contract Health Service Delivery Area (CHSDA)
counties.
Several notable, recent studies have used cross-sectional,
nationally representative survey data to describe trends in
and the current prevalence of major liver cancer risk factors.
As such, these studies are summarized herein in lieu of rep-
licating previous analyses. In brief, we included in our
review studies that analyzed the CDC’s National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for preva-
lence estimates of obesity,21 hepatitis B virus (HBV) and
HCV infection,6,22 diabetes,23 and nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease.24 NHANES’ estimates for several health-related
factors are based on direct measurements gathered during
in-person examinations and thus are less susceptible to bias
from self-report. State-level estimates of obesity and alcohol
intake were obtained from analyses of the Behavioral Risk
Factor Surveillance System, a computer-assisted telephone

 survey of adults 18 years and older. Additional studies we
reviewed used data from the CDC’s National Health Inter-
view Survey (self-reported cigarette smoking prevalence)25
and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration’s National Survey on Drug Use and Health
(self-reported binge drinking among adults ages 50 years
and older).26
Cancer Occurrence
National Level
Incidence and mortality
Average annual liver cancer incidence (2009-2013) and
death (2010-2014) rates for the most recent 5 years of avail-
able data in the United States were 7.7 and 6.3 per 100,000,
respectively. Both incidence and death rates were notably 2-
to 3-fold higher in men than in women for each of the 5
major racial/ethnic groups (Table 1). Liver cancer incidence
and death rates were highest for AIs/ANs (15.2 and 11.9
per 100,000, respectively) and were more than double those
in NH whites (6.3 and 5.5 per 100,000, respectively),
among whom the rates were lowest. Death rates increased
with age up to ages 80 to 84 years in all racial/ethnic groups
except blacks, among whom mortality peaked at ages 60 to
64 years (Fig. 1).
Liver cancer incidence and mortality patterns are similar,
with rates overall increasing since at least 1975 for incidence
and since 1980 for mortality.4 Data by ethnicity are only
available since 1992 for incidence (Fig. 2) and since 1990
for mortality (Fig. 3). From 1990 to 2014, death rates rose
by 57% in blacks, 69% in Hispanics, and 82% in NH whites;
in AIs/ANs, the death rate more than doubled, from 5.4
(per 100,000) to 11.9. In stark contrast, death rates declined
slightly in APIs, from 10.8 (per 100,000) in 1990 to 9.6 in
2014. As a result of this divergent trend, a crossover
between APIs and AIs/ANs occurred, in that death rates in
AIs/ANs were about 40% lower than those in APIs in 1990
but were 10% higher in 2014 (Fig. 3). In all racial/ethnic
groups, changes in liver cancer death rates were in the same
direction among men and women (Table 2).
Overall, our findings confirm and expand upon results on
liver cancer occurrence from the Annual Report series and
other published results.2,3,11,27 Despite rising death rates,
however, liver cancer incidence rates in AIs/ANs did not
show any increase after 2009 in our analysis. This is likely
because AI/AN mortality data in our analysis were from
CHSDA counties nationwide, whereas incidence trends
were based only on cases from CHSDA counties in areas

 covered by SEER 13. Indeed, the Annual Report, which
used nationwide CHSDA incidence data, reported a statis-
tically significant, continuous increase in liver cancer inci-
dence among AI/AN men from 2003 to 2012,2 consistent
with death rate trends in our analysis.
Stage distribution and survival
Figure 4 shows liver cancer stage distribution by race/eth-
nicity. The proportion of liver cancers diagnosed at the
localized stage ranged from 40% in AIs/ANs to 45% in
APIs (approximately 15% of cases were unknown stage).
The 5-year liver cancer-specific survival rate was 21% overall
for patients diagnosed during 2006 through 2012, ranging
from 4% for distant stage disease to 37% for localized dis-
ease (Fig. 5). There was little difference in 5-year survival
between men and women. Compared with NH whites
(20%), survival was statistically significantly lower in blacks
(16%) and higher in APIs (27%) (Table 1). Absolute differ-
ences in stage-specific survival by race/ethnicity were largest
for localized disease, for which survival was highest in APIs
(46%) and lowest in blacks (30%) and AIs/ANs (28%) (Fig.
5). Notably, although there was little difference in stage dis-
tribution between NH whites and blacks, the 5-year survival
rate in blacks was approximately 5% lower for all stages
combined (Table 1).
The 5-year survival rate for liver cancer has been
increasing since at least 1992 in all races except for AIs/
ANs, in whom the trend is inconsistent, in part because
of sparse data (Fig. 6). Compared with NH whites, 5-
year survival has increased more rapidly in APIs and has
lagged in blacks, whereas trends in Hispanics have been
similar. By stage, the most significant increase occurred
for localized disease, for which the 5-year survival rate
increased from 17% for patients diagnosed in the early
1990s to 39% for those diagnosed during 2006 through
2012 in the SEER 13 areas (Fig. 6). A more modest
increase in survival was observed for regional-stage liver
cancers, which rose from 8% to 14% over the same period.
No improvement has been observed for distant-stage
disease.
Consistent with our results, earlier studies found a lower
5-year survival rate in blacks than in whites27 and an
increase in 5-year relative survival in all races combined and
in studied races (whites, blacks), largely limited to localized-
stage and regional-stage liver cancer.3
State-Level Mortality
Similar to national patterns, liver cancer death rates in most
states were 2- to 3-fold higher in men than in women
(Table 3). Racial/ethnic disparities in liver cancer mortality
were present in most states, including those with relatively
less poverty and low liver cancer death rates, in which low
rates among whites masked markedly higher rates among
racial/ethnic minority groups (eg, Minnesota and Utah).
Among states with available data, liver cancer death rates

 were statistically significantly higher in black men than in
NH white men in all states except Mississippi, New Mex-
ico, Arkansas, and South Carolina. The black-white racial
disparity was the highest in the District of Columbia, in
which the black rate for both sexes combined (13.3 per
100,000) was more than 4 times higher than that for NH
whites (3.2 per 100,000). Liver cancer death rates were gen-
erally higher in APIs than in NH whites across states,
although in some states with fewer liver cancer deaths
among APIs, the difference was not statistically significant.
Disparity patterns for Hispanics were less consistent than
those for other minority groups, in that liver cancer death
rates were higher than in NH whites in only about one-half
of states with available data.
The liver cancer death rate in both sexes combined during
2010 through 2014 was highest (�8 per 100,000) in the Dis-
trict of Columbia, Hawaii, Louisiana, and Texas and lowest
(<5 per 100,000) in Iowa, Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska,
Utah, Vermont, and North Dakota (Fig. 7). Consistent with a
lower liver cancer death rate in NH whites, the death rate was
generally higher in states with a lower proportion of NH
whites. Among states with comparable proportions of NH
whites, those with higher poverty levels tended to have higher
liver cancer death rates. For example, the rate was higher in
Kentucky (6.1 per 100,000; population, 87% NH whites) than
in North Dakota (3.8 per 100,000; 89% NH whites).
The geographic patterns of incidence described in the
Annual Report were generally comparable to the mortality

 patterns in our study, with some differences. For example, in
the Annual Report, Alabama and Louisiana ranked among the
second and third quartile of states, respectively, in terms of
liver cancer incidence rates2 but were among the 10 states with
highest liver cancer death rates in our analysis. These differ-
ences may be related to variation in access to care across states.
Risk Factors
Current Status and Trends
The majority (approximately 60%) of liver cancers in the
United States are attributed to potentially modifiable risk
factors, although these proportions vary somewhat because
of differences in data sources, study periods, and methodol-
ogy.28–30 Makarova-Rusher et al estimated that, among US
Medicare recipients during 2000 through 2011, metabolic
disorders (including excess body weight, diabetes, impaired
glucose tolerance, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and meta-
bolic syndrome) accounted for the largest proportion of
hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) (32%), followed by
chronic HCV infection (21%), excessive alcohol drinking
(13%), smoking (9%), and chronic HBV infection (4%).28
HCC is the major histologic type of primary liver cancer,
accounting for greater than 70% of all liver cancers in the

that 24% of all liver cancer deaths in adults ages 35 years
and older in 2011 were caused by smoking.30 Although the
magnitude of association between HBV/HCV infection
and HCC is much greater (relative risk [RR], 22-60) than
that of excessive alcohol drinking (RR, 7.3), metabolic

 disorders (RR, 3.8),28 or smoking (RR, 1.5),31 these factors
account for a substantial number of HCCs in the United
States because of their higher population prevalence. Rare
genetic disorders account for only 2% to 3% of HCCs.28,29
Differences in risk factor prevalence accounts for much of
the variation in liver cancer rates by sex, age group, state,
and race/ethnicity. For example, higher liver cancer death
rates in Texan Hispanics (predominantly of Mexican origin)
than in Floridian Hispanics (mostly of Cuban or Puerto
Rican origin) may reflect higher prevalence of chronic HCV
infection, excess body weight, and nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease in Mexican Americans than in Hispanics of Cuban
or Puerto Rican origin, as well as differences in immigration
history.32,33 Among populations with a large proportion of
recent immigrants (APIs and Hispanics), aggregated liver
cancer rates are influenced by high background HCV/HBV
prevalence in some countries of origin.34,35 Conversely,
acculturation across generations in these populations also
increases liver cancer risk, as several lifestyle risk factors are
more common in the United States (eg, obesity, alcohol
consumption, and smoking) than in many parts of Asia and
Latin America.
Hepatitis C virus
HCV infection accounts for approximately 20% of liver
cancers worldwide,36 with prevalence ranging from 3.5% or
more in many countries in Central, East, and Western Asia
and North Africa to less than 1% in several higher income
countries in Western Europe.37 According to NHANES,
the prevalence of chronic HCV infection (defined as posi-
tive HCV RNA testing) in the United States was 1% dur-
ing 2003 through 2010, representing approximately 2.7
million people.6,38 However, this number is likely an
underestimate, because populations with very high infection
prevalence (eg, heavy drug users and incarcerated or home-
less people) are not represented in NHANES.37,38 A study
incorporating these populations estimated that at least 3.5
million adults were infected with HCV as of 2010.38 People
born between 1945 and 1965 (“baby boomers”) have an
HCV prevalence of approximately 2.6% and account for
about 80% of HCV-infected cases,6 which explains the
increased age-specific death rates for individuals ages 50 to
64 years in the current study. Major risk factors for chronic
HCV infection in the United States are injection drug use
and receipt of a transfusion before 1992.6 Other factors that
increase risk include being born to an HCV-infected
mother, receiving high-risk tattoos or body piercing,
needle-stick injuries, having sexual contact with infected
people, and some medical conditions (eg, transplantation,
hemodialysis, and human immunodeficiency virus infec-
tion).39 HCV infection prevalence in the United States is
higher among those with lower education or income and
among ages 20–59 years is nearly twice as high among men
as among women.2,6
According to NHANES, blacks in the United States
are more likely than other races/ethnicities combined to
have chronic HCV infection, although the prevalence for
other individual minority groups is not available because
of sparse data.6 Some surveys and reports from state
health departments indicate that HCV infection is gener-
ally more common in AIs/ANs, APIs, and Hispanics
than in NH whites but may vary by geographic loca-
tion.34,35,40–43 Overall, the proportion of all HCCs dur-
ing 2000 through 2011 attributable to HCV was 17% in
whites, 21% in Hispanics, 30% in Asians, and 36% in
blacks.28

whites in the population during 2010 through 2014 were based on US Census Bureau 2015 vintage population estimates available through the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program.
Liver Cancer in the United States

 Although representative information on HCV prevalence
across states is not available, states with higher liver cancer
incidence rates have generally reported higher HCV infec-
tion prevalence.40,42,43 Higher prevalence of HCV infection
in nonwhites and those with lower income is consistent
with higher liver cancer death rates in states with both a
higher proportion of nonwhites and high poverty.
Hepatitis B virus
Although HBV infection is the most common cause of liver
cancer globally, accounting for over one-half of liver cancer
cases worldwide, it accounts for less than 5% of liver cancers
in the United States.36 HBV infection prevalence is 5% or
greater in many low- and middle-income countries in sub-
Saharan Africa, Central and East Asia, and the Western
Pacific, as well as a small number of countries in other
regions, but it is generally low (<2%) in high-income coun-
tries.44,45 Transmission of HBV infection in endemic coun-
tries is most common from mother to infant (vertical
transmission), whereas in other countries, it mainly occurs
through direct contact with body fluids, such as sharing
syringes for drug use, needle-stick injuries, and sexual con-
tact (horizontal transmission).44
Since the 1990s, the overall prevalence of chronic HBV
infection (defined as positive for hepatitis B surface antigen)
in the United States has been stable at 0.3% to 0.4% in indi-
viduals ages 20 years and older but has declined substantially
(from 0.2% to 0.03%) in those ages 6 to 19 years, largely
reflecting the influence of HBV vaccination uptake among
children.22 During 2011 to 2012, an estimated 850,000 peo-
ple in the United States had chronic HBV infection.22
However, prevalence varies greatly by race/ethnicity, rang-
ing from 0.1% in NH whites and Mexican Americans to
0.6% in blacks and 3.1% in Asians.22 Prevalence is also
higher among foreign-born individuals (1.1%) compared
with those born in the United States (0.1%),22 with those
born in China and other highly endemic countries having
substantially higher prevalence (�9%).46 Consequently,
93% of Asians with chronic HBV infection are foreign-
born,22 and the proportion of all HCCs during 2000

 through 2011 attributable to HBV was 18% in Asians, com-
pared with <3% in whites, blacks, and Hispanics.28 A con-
siderable proportion of liver cancers among Pacific Islander
and AI/AN adults may also be attributable to HBV infec-
tion because of their high prevalence of HBV infection,
although these data are unavailable.47,48
Metabolic disorders and excess body weight
Prospective studies have demonstrated that liver cancer risk
increases by 26% per 5 kg/m2 increase in body mass index
(BMI) in the United States,7 where 69% of people ages 20
years and older have excess body weight (BMI �25
kg/m2).49 From the 1960s to 2013-2014, the prevalence of
overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/m2) among adults remained
high but stable at 32% to 34%,50 while obesity (BMI �30
kg/m2) tripled from 13% to 38%, and class 3 obesity (BMI
�40 kg/m2) increased 8-fold, from 1% to 8%.21 These
increases occurred in both men and women until the late
1990s, but since have been mainly confined to women.21,50
Currently, overweight prevalence is higher in men (38%)
than in women (30%), but more women than men are obese
(40% vs 35%) and class 3 obese (10% vs 6%).21 The preva-
lence of obesity has substantially increased in all races/eth-
nicities with available historical information.50 Among
women, obesity prevalence ranges about 3-fold to 5-fold,
from a low of 12% in Asians to 38% in NH whites, 47% in
Hispanics, and 57% in blacks.21 Among men, obesity preva-
lence in NH whites (35%), blacks (38%), and Hispanics
(38%) is similar but is nearly 3-fold the prevalence in Asians
(13%).21
Prevalence of obesity by state and race/ethnicity is shown
in Figure 8. In most cases, patterns of obesity prevalence in
each racial/ethnic group correspond to liver cancer death
rates. For example, both obesity prevalence and liver cancer
mortality in the District of Columbia are among the lowest
in the country in NH whites but are very high in blacks.
Obesity may also contribute to substantially higher liver
cancer death rates in blacks and Hispanics than in NH
whites in Texas. In some other instances, however, this pat-
tern is more equivocal. For example, although NH whites in
Hawaii have lower obesity prevalence than NH whites in
the continental United States, their liver cancer death rate is
higher. These inconsistencies likely reflect differences in the
prevalence of other major contributors to liver cancer, nota-
bly viral hepatitis infection.
A large-scale, prospective study in the United States
has demonstrated that diabetes increases the risk of liver
cancer by 2.3-fold in men and 1.4-fold in women.7 Con-
sistent with the increase in excess body weight, the preva-
lence of diabetes has increased from 9.8% in the late 1980s
to 12.4% in 2011-2012, and it is estimated that an addi-
tional 36.5% are prediabetic.23 The increase in diabetes
over 2 decades has been more modest in NH whites (from
8.6% to 9.5%) than in blacks and Mexican Americans
(from approximately 17% to 21%). Although trend data
are not available for other minority groups, the contempo-
rary prevalence of diabetes was relatively high in all His-
panics combined (18.7%) and in Asians (16.5%),23 despite
lower BMIs in the latter.21 Diabetes prevalence is also
high and increasing rapidly in those with low education
and income.23,51
More than 20% of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease, a condition highly associated with excess body
weight and diabetes, will develop nonalcoholic steatohepati-
tis, a more serious type of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in
which fat accumulation in the liver causes inflammation and
cell damage, thereby increasing the risk of liver cancer.52
There is little information on trends in nonalcoholic steato-
hepatitis prevalence from population studies, partly because
diagnosis may require invasive procedures. However, a few
studies have reported a rising trend in the prevalence of
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in the United States, consis-
tent with the increases in excess body weight and diabetes

 prevalence, although there may be variations in reported
prevalence based on diagnostic criteria used in those stud-
ies.24,53 An analysis of NHANES data reported an increase
in the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease from
18% during 1988 through 1991, to 29% during 1999 and
2000, and to 31% during 2011 and 2012.24 Among the 3
racial/ethnic groups in that analysis, Mexican Americans
had the highest prevalence, followed by NH whites and
blacks. An analysis of data from more than 1.3 million vet-
erans using different diagnostic criteria also demonstrated
an increase, although the reported prevalence was lower (an
increase from 6% in 2003 to 18% in 2011); racial patterns
were similar to those in NHANES.52
Alcohol drinking and tobacco smoking
Alcohol
consumption
increases
liver
cancer
risk
by
approximately 10% per drink per day (eg, a 3-fold
increased risk for someone consuming 8 drinks per day).54
Excessive drinking includes binge drinking (�4 drinks per
occasion for a woman or �5 drinks per occasion for a
man) and heavy drinking (�8 drinks per week for a
woman or �15 drinks per week for a man).55 Binge drink-
ing is the most common type of excessive alcohol drinking
in the United States—17% of adults (or 38 million people)
binge drink.55 On the basis of the National Survey on
Drug Use and Health, binge drinking prevalence among
individuals aged 50 years and older has increased by
approximately 20% in the last decade.26 Men, those with a
higher income, and tobacco and illicit drug users are most
likely to binge drink. Compared with NH whites, the
self-reported prevalence of binge drinking is similar in
blacks, lower in Asians, and slightly higher in Hispanics.26
As illustrated in Figure 9, states with the highest preva-
lence of binge drinking are in the North and Midwest,
whereas the intensity of binge drinking is highest in the
central South and parts of the Midwest.
Smoking increases liver cancer risk by approximately
50%.31 Smoking prevalence among men is highest in AIs/
ANs (38%), followed by blacks (21%), NH whites (17%),
and APIs and Hispanics (12% to 13%). Prevalence in
women is generally much lower than in men within the
same racial/ethnic group (24% in AIs/ANs, 13% in blacks,
7% in Hispanics, and 3% in APIs), with the exception of
NH white women (16%).25 Despite overall reductions in
smoking in the United States, prevalence is highest and
declines are weakest among individuals with lower educa-
tion levels and incomes,25 who have a higher likelihood of
other liver cancer risk factors. States with the highest smok-
ing prevalence are in the Southern region among NH
whites, in Southern states and the Midwest in black men,
and in the Midwest in black women.56
Interventions
Many liver cancer cases could potentially be prevented by
alleviating exposure to risk factors or mitigating the risk
among those exposed. The following is a broad summary of
current strategies along with their limitations and includes
interventions intended for low-income individuals, minori-
ties, and other high-risk groups. Tailored, culturally appro-
priate
application
of
these
interventions
for
different
subpopulations at the state and local level is essential but
remains a challenge, particularly considering the disparities in
health care access and limitations in public health resources.
Hepatitis virus infection
The Institute of Medicine has established 4 general groups
of recommendations for the prevention and control of HBV
and HCV, including improvements in infection surveil-
lance, awareness, infection care and services, and HBV vac-
cination.57 More representative data are required on HBV
and HCV prevalence among subpopulations in the United
States, including data by state and from high-risk popula-
tions (eg, the homeless). Increasing awareness among policy
makers, health care providers, and the general population is
an essential part of any strategy to control HBV and HCV
infection. Awareness is even more important for those at
risk and the individuals/organizations that serve them,
because many are unaware of viral hepatitis infection screen-
ing, HBV vaccination, or the availability of treatment to
cure HCV infection. Currently, the CDC recommends
one-time HCV testing for people born from 1945 to
1965.39 However, only 14% of this cohort has reported
HCV testing, with little variation between Asians, NH
whites, blacks, and Hispanics.58 In contrast, a recent assess-
ment indicated that HCV testing among the AI/AN 1945
to 1965 birth cohort served by the Indian Health Service
increased 4-fold during 2012 through 2015, from 8% to
33%, likely due in part to the implementation of integrated
electronic clinical decision-support tools at Indian Health
Service facilities as well as other provider-based initiatives.59
Some professional organizations also recommend screening
for high-risk individuals,39 including the incarcerated popu-
lation, which may be one of the cost-effective ways to
reduce transmission of HCV infection.60
Although interferon and/or ribavirin have been used with
some success to treat HCV infection, the introduction of oral
direct-acting antivirals in 2014 represented major progress,
resulting in very high cure rates with shorter term treatment
and substantially fewer adverse side effects.61,62 Although
future studies are needed to determine the long-term effects
of these new drugs, they are likely to reduce HCV complica-
tions, including HCC. However, underdiagnoses of HCV
cases, in addition to obstacles to care and the high cost of
direct-acting antivirals, are major barriers. For example, only
slightly more than one-third of those with known HCV
CA CANCER J CLIN 2017;67:273–289
VOLUME 67 _ NUMBER 4 _ JULY/AUGUST 2017
283
 infection receive follow-up care, and less than 10% are suc-
cessfully treated.39 The variation in reimbursement of direct-
acting antivirals because of their high cost further contributes
to suboptimal access in states with more restricted coverage.39
Unlike HCV, treatments for HBV infection, including
pegylated a-interferon and nucleos(t)ide analogues, may halt
the progression of active liver disease but do not cure the
infection.62,63 Thus, although these treatments have been able
to reduce the risk of HBV-related HCC, they require long-
term administration.64 HBV vaccination is the most effective
means of preventing HBV infection and liver cancer and has
been part of routine childhood vaccinations in the United
States since 1982.65–67 In 2014, HBV vaccination coverage in
children ages 19 to 35 months in the United States was 91%
to 93% in NH whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians, and it
was slightly higher in Pacific Islanders (95%) and AIs/ANs
(99%).68 Despite historically high HBV infection prevalence
among Pacific Islanders and Alaska natives, comprehensive
universal infant vaccination has been very successful in lower-
ing the childhood infection rate in these populations.47,48 For
example, HBV prevalence in children ages 2 to 11 years in the
US-affiliated Pacific Island countries decreased from 8.4% in
the 1980s to 0.2% in the 2000s.48 Although greater than 90%
of adolescents in the United States received the HBV vaccine
in 2015, coverage varied across states, ranging from 83% in
Idaho to 98% in New Hampshire.69 HBV vaccination of
high-risk adults is also recommended, but coverage remains
low at only 50% in the United States.57 Both HBV and HCV
infection can be prevented through the expansion of compre-
hensive programs to reduce transmission through high-risk
behaviors (eg, using shared syringes).57
Excess body weight
Consistent with a substantial increase in the number of peo-
ple with excess body weight and associated metabolic disor-
ders in the United States, the estimated proportion of
HCCs attributable to these factors increased from 26% dur-
ing 2000 through 2003 to 36% during 2008 through 2011.28
Excess body weight in childhood is a major contributor to
the obesity epidemic, because, for many children, it extends
into adulthood; it is also a risk factor for type II diabetes and
other metabolic disorders associated with liver cancer in
adults.70,71 Therefore, preventing excess body weight in chil-
dren should be a major focus of any weight-control interven-
tion at the population level. Among children and adolescents
ages 2 to 19 years, approximately one-third have excess body
weight and 17% are obese, although there is substantial vari-
ation by race/ethnicity and across states.49,72,73
The etiology of childhood obesity is complex and is influ-
enced by multiple behavioral, cultural/environmental (eg,
family, school), socioeconomic, and genetic factors, which
can lead to unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and adverse
changes in metabolism.70,74–77 The relative effect of these
factors may vary across subpopulations, including by race/
ethnicity.75–77 Because children generally spend a consider-
able amount of time in school (including preschool), school-
based interventions can provide a great opportunity for
weight control, such as education about healthy lifestyles
and increasing physical activity and access to affordable,
healthy food while reducing access to unhealthier foods at
school.74 However, the effects of school-based interventions
may be difficult to sustain long term, and studies have
shown
that
additional
environmental
strategies
could
improve outcomes. For example, family-based interventions
may help to improve diet, increase physical activity, and
reduce screen time at home.74–76
Among adults, intensive lifestyle interventions (including
diet, physical activity, and behavior therapy) to promote
healthier diet and physical activity have been shown to be
successful in maintaining or reducing body weight and dia-
betes risk among participants in several studies.78–80 How-
ever, these interventions have not been as successful at the
population level, including when offered through primary
care providers.81–83 This inconsistency may be due in part to
participation bias, but it may also reflect primary care pro-
viders’ time constraints and insufficient training for deliver-
ing
effective
behavioral
counseling,
which
could
be
remedied through appropriate instruction or referrals.81–84
When lifestyle interventions are not successful for adequate
weight loss, individuals with obesity may be eligible for
pharmacotherapy, and those with class 3 obesity may benefit
from bariatric surgery.85
The use of modern communication technologies, such as
social and mobile tools, may have the potential to increase
the efficiency and accessibility of behavioral interventions, but
studies to date have produced mixed results.86–88 Some regu-
lations and policies may also help weight-control strategies in
both children and adults, including mass media campaigns
(increasing awareness and education to change unhealthy
behaviors), food labeling and advertising regulation, taxation
of nonessential high-calorie foods and sugary beverages, and
improvements in urban structure (eg, increasing public trans-
portation).89–92 Overall, maintaining normal weight may be
more challenging for minorities and individuals with low
income, because they often live in neighborhoods with more
limited access to healthier foods and appropriate environ-
ments for physical activity.75,76 For example, poor neighbor-
hoods usually have limited sports facilities and programs (in
schools and outside) and fewer or unsafe sidewalks.75,76
Increased awareness, the availability of multiple recom-
mendations and guidelines for maintaining a healthy body
weight, and the implementation of some community-level
interventions and regulations may have contributed to a
modest decrease in obesity in children ages 2 to 5 years and
stable trends in children ages 6 to 11 years as well as adult

 men in the United States during the last decade.21,49,72
However, to adequately address the obesity epidemic and
associated metabolic disorders, comprehensive implementa-
tion of successful interventions and additional research to
identify more efficient strategies at the population level,
especially in racial/ethnic minorities, are needed.72
Other risk factors
In addition to reducing weight and increasing physical
activity, appropriate diabetes care can prevent or delay com-
plications like nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. However,
undiagnosed diabetes remains a substantial challenge in the
United States; one-third of patients with diabetes in the
most recent NHANES survey were diagnosed by laboratory
tests used in the survey and had not been previously diag-
nosed.23 Undiagnosed diabetes was more common in Asians
and Hispanics (50%) than in blacks (37%) and NH whites
(32%). This highlights the importance of access to preven-
tive medicine and routine blood sugar tests. However, dis-
parities in access to high-quality diabetes care persist even
among those diagnosed with the disease, largely driven by
lack of insurance coverage,93 particularly among Hispanics
overall and lower income groups.94,95
For preventing excessive alcohol drinking, the Community
Preventive Services Task Force recommends increasing alco-
hol excise taxes; regulating alcohol outlet density and the days
and hours of alcohol sale; maintaining government controls
over alcohol sales; using computers, mobile phones, and other
electronic devices for interventions; and holding retailers
accountable for harms when they illegally sell/serve alcohol.55
Effective policies for reducing tobacco control have been dis-
cussed comprehensively in several publications.31 Briefly, the
policies recommended by the World Health Organization’s
Framework Convention on Tobacco Control include tobacco
taxation, smoke-free laws, warning about the dangers of
tobacco (warning labels and media campaigns), marketing
bans, and assistance with smoking cessation.96 Smoking prev-
alence across states is highly correlated with tobacco-control
policies in states.56,97 Although smoking may play a smaller
role than some other risk factors in the burden of liver cancer,
reducing tobacco use will also prevent numerous deaths from
many other cancers and chronic diseases.30,97
Treatment and Survival
HCC has a very poor prognosis. The overall median survival
for patients with untreated disease is 4 months, ranging
from 2 months for late-stage cancers to 14 months for very
early stage cancers.98 Potentially curative treatments are
available for early stage liver cancers, including surgical
resection, ablation, and liver transplantation.99–102 Cur-
rently, HCC is the leading diagnosis among liver transplant
recipients (27% in 2015), and the number of liver trans-
plants because of liver cancer continues to increase.103
Transarterial embolization and transcatheter arterial chemo-
embolization are usually used to treat patients with
intermediate-stage liver cancer who do not have tumor-
related symptoms, vascular invasion, or metastasis and may
increase survival.100–102,104 Improvements in and access to
treatments are the likely reasons for a substantial increase in
localized-stage liver cancer survival and, to a lesser degree,
regional-stage survival, as demonstrated in our analysis. Sys-
temic treatment with sorafenib (an oral multikinase inhibi-
tor) is used for more advanced HCCs, except for end-stage
cancers, which are generally considered for palliative care
only. However, sorafenib can increase survival for only a few
months.100–102 This, along with the lack of any specific
treatment
for
end-stage
HCC,
explains
the
little
improvement in 5-year survival for advanced cancers over
the entire study period in our analysis.
Variation in treatment may account in part for differential
stage-specific survival by race and ethnicity. Disparities in
treatment for patients diagnosed with potentially curable,
early stage disease have been documented in several studies. A
study of patients diagnosed from 1998 to 2011 with clinical
stage I/II HCC indicated that slightly less than 40% under-
went surgery. A lower probability of undergoing surgery was
observed for black and uninsured or Medicaid-insured
patients in multivariate models that included stage and
comorbidity score. In that study, the median survival of
patients who underwent surgery was 48.3 months compared
with 8.4 months for those who did not undergo surgery.105
Other studies have noted pronounced disparities in the receipt
of liver transplantation among patients who were eligible for
this treatment. One such study of patients with early stage
HCC reported to SEER registries from 1998 to 2010 who
were eligible for liver transplantation based on the Milan cri-
teria indicated that black, Asian, and Hispanic patients were
substantially less likely to receive this treatment than NH
whites.106 A study in California by race and ethnicity exam-
ined HCC treatment and survival patterns in greater detail
for Asian subpopulations. Consistent with previous studies,
that study indicated that the probability of receiving surgical
treatment was lower for black and Hispanic patients than for
NH white patients. In addition, the study found considerable
variations in surgical treatment among Asian subpopulations,
with the lowest rates reported for Laotian/Hmong and Cam-
bodian patients and the highest rates reported for Chinese,
Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese patients.107 Those studies
suggested that considerable progress in reducing liver cancer
mortality could be achieved by ensuring equitable access to
high-quality treatment, especially for patients with early stage
disease for whom surgery potentially can be curative.
Part of the improvement in survival for localized-stage can-
cers may also be related to earlier detection. The American
Association for the Study of Liver Diseases has developed
CA CANCER J CLIN 2017;67:273–289
VOLUME 67 _ NUMBER 4 _ JULY/AUGUST 2017
285
 guidelines for the surveillance of high-risk individuals, such as
certain patients with cirrhosis, HBV- or HCV-related chronic
active hepatitis, or other chronic liver diseases that meet certain
criteria.100,101 However, although studies have suggested that
such surveillance is cost-effective and could lead to a greater
percentage of liver cancers diagnosed at earlier stages, it
remains controversial.100,101,108–110 Because of a lack of high-
quality data from clinical trials, it is unclear whether liver can-
cer surveillance could translate into lower mortality from the
disease,100,101,110 demonstrating the need for further research.
Limitations
Population-based cancer data in the United States are gener-
ally available only for the 5 broad groups presented herein.
However, liver cancer rates can vary substantially by sub-
group within these large, heterogeneous populations. For
example, as pointed out by the Office of Management and
Budget in 1997, the broad category of Asian and Pacific
Islander is problematic because it includes subpopulations
with vastly disparate cultural, socioeconomic, and health pro-
files, which lead to substantial variations in cancer occur-
rence. In addition, caution is warranted when interpreting
death rates and cancer-specific survival for racial groups
other than NH whites and blacks, because both racial/ethnic
misclassification on death certificates and nonrandom cen-
soring because of biases in patient follow-up are more likely
to occur. One recent analysis indicated that APIs and His-
panics were substantially more likely to be censored (lost to
follow-up) within the first 5 years after a cancer diagnosis
than NH whites, particularly for cancers with an unfavorable
prognosis.111 Finally, liver cancer incidence and mortality
rates in AIs/ANs were based on a relatively modest number
of outcomes and should be interpreted with caution.
Conclusions
The burden of liver cancer in the United States is significant
and is expected to increase in the decades to come. More-
over, despite some improvements in localized and regional
disease survival rates in the 2 most recent decades of avail-
able data, the overall prognosis for liver cancer remains
poor. Wide disparities in liver cancer death rates by sex,
race/ethnicity, and state persist, reflecting differences in the
prevalence of major risk factors and, to some extent,
inequalities in access to high-quality care. However, most
liver cancers are potentially preventable, and interventions
to curb the rising burden of liver cancer and reduce racial/
ethnic disparities should include the targeted application of
existing knowledge in prevention, early detection, and treat-
ment, including improvements in HBV vaccination, screen-
ing and treatment of HCV, maintaining a healthy body
weight, access to high-quality diabetes care, prevention of
excessive alcohol drinking, and tobacco control. �
