background Children who experience parental 
cancer are at increased risk of developing emotional, 
social, cognitive and behavioural problems. Our aim 
was to investigate how experience of parental cancer 
in childhood or adolescence is associated with primary 
school achievement, educational attainment and income 
in early adult life.
Methods This is a register-linkage, prospective study 
of children born in Denmark from 1978 through 1999 
and their parents. Parental cancer experience before the 
ages of 15 and 18 was identified in the Danish National 
Patient Registry. Final grade point average (GPA) in 
ninth grade, educational attainment and disposable 
personal income at the age of 30 were identified in 
Statistics Denmark registers. General linear models and 
multinomial logistic regression were used to estimate 
beta estimates of GPA, and relative risk ratios (RRR) 
for lower educational and income levels compared 
with children without parental cancer, taking parental 
educational status into account.
results Children who had experienced parental cancer 
achieved a slightly lower final GPA in ninth grade and 
had a higher risk of low educational attainment (RRR: 
1.20; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.25) and attenuated income at 
the age of 30 (RRR: 1.11; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.16). For all 
outcomes, analyses suggested substantial deterioration 
in achievements in subgroups of children whose parent 
had a severe cancer type (RRRLow education: 1.52; 95% CI 
1.39 to 1.66) or if the parent died of cancer (RRRLow 
education: 1.61; 95% CI 1.49 to 1.75).
Conclusion Educational and socioeconomic 
attainments in early adulthood were affected negatively 
in individuals who had experienced parental cancer 
as children or adolescents. The associations appeared 
stronger the more severe the cancer was.
InTroduCTIon
At present, approximately one-third of the Danish 
population is diagnosed with cancer at some point 
in a life course.1 Additionally, the cancer inci-
dence is continually increasing and a 10% increase 
is expected within the next decade.1 It has been 
reported that one in every six cancer survivors is 
residing with their minor children.2 Having cancer 
in the prime childbearing and parenting age range 
not only poses unique short-term and long-term 
challenges to the patient with cancer, since a nega-
tive impact may extend to the children and the 
rest of the family.3–8 As the cancer incidence is 
increasing, the population of children experiencing 
a parent with cancer is also expanding.
Children of parents with cancer have received 
growing attention within the field of paediatric 
research.9 Research suggests that children affected 
by parental cancer may experience problems in 
many domains, including emotional, social, cogni-
tive, behavioural and physical functioning.4–8 
Besides reducing children’s quality of life, such 
problems may induce social impairment and impact 
school achievement and learning.2 7 10 11 Further, 
the literature suggests that children living with a 
physically or mentally ill parent undertake domestic 
responsibilities and household roles and assist in 
caregiving. These conditions negatively affect their 
time spent in social activities, and their time and 
ability to learn and to do homework, hence their 
academic achievement.12 13 Additionally, the vulner-
ability of children when a parent is diagnosed with 
cancer may depend on a variety of factors, such 
as the child’s age, sex, cognitive maturity as well 
as gender of the ill parent, nature of the illness 
and treatment effects, social background, family 
dynamics, and whether the family unit is intact or 
separated.2 3 13 14
Adolescence is a formative period of life, normally 
encompassing the crucial last school years, years of 
education and labour market establishment.15 These 
achievements are pivotal to good living standards 
and prosperity, individually and societally, and are 
fundamental in shaping an individual’s life chances 
and socioeconomic position (SEP) in a life course.16 
Poor adjustment to parental cancer in childhood or 
adolescence may thus impact on subsequent SEP 
with consequences on adult health.13 16
Little attention has been given to the impact 
of parental cancer on children’s primary school 
achievements and socioeconomic attainments in a 
life course perspective.4–6 Expanding our under-
standing of these associations may help to iden-
tify children and adolescents in high-risk groups 
who may benefit from appropriate support and 
early educational rehabilitation in teenage years 
if a parent is diagnosed with cancer, and thereby 
promote educational and health equality.15 16
The overall objective of this study was therefore 
to investigate the association between experience of 
parental cancer and social career of the children, 
specifically the association between parental cancer

study population
We assembled a Danish nationwide cohort of children born in 
Denmark from 1 January 1978 through 31 December 1999 
registered in the Danish Medical Birth Registry.17 Individuals 
were eligible for inclusion in the study if alive and residing 
in Denmark in the year of follow-up. The unique individual 
personal identification number assigned to all persons with a 
permanent residence in Denmark allowed linkage between chil-
dren and parents, and furthermore linkage with several nation-
wide Danish registries containing comprehensive information 
on health and social issues.18 Data were stored and processed 
at Statistics Denmark and no personally identifiable data were 
accessible.
Primary school achievement
Primary school achievement was assessed by attained grade 
point average (GPA) of examination grades and final teacher

evaluations completed in ninth grade (around the age of 15) in 
Danish public and private schools.19 Ninth grade corresponds 
to 9 
years of compulsory schooling plus one optional introduc-
tory year attended by more than 95% of Danish children. GPA 
covers the major domains of academic achievement, including 
Danish and foreign languages, mathematics, hard sciences, and 
social sciences. Registration of school grades in the Danish 
Ministry of Education was established in school year 2001/2002, 
and we obtained the information from the Academic Achieve-
ment Register.19 Study population I (SP-I) included 795 
160 
children born from 1986 through 1999. Due to changes in the 
Danish grading system in 2007, school grades before 2007 were 
converted into the currently used 7-point scale. The 7-point 
scale consists of seven grades (−03, 00, 02, 4, 7, 10, 12), where 
a score below 02 is considered not satisfactory (ie, failed).
socioeconomic attainment
Educational attainment and annual DPI at the age of 30 were 
used as measures of socioeconomic attainment. Study popu-
lation II (SP-II) consisted of children born from 1978 to 1984 
(n=360 
054).
Information on educational attainment was obtained from the 
Danish Population’s Education Register available at Statistics 
Denmark.19 Educational level was operationalised as the highest 
completed attained education in the given year and was catego-
rised into three groups according to the International Standard 
Classification of Education (ISCED) 2011: low (ISCED 0–2), 
medium (ISCED 3–4) and high (ISCED 5–8).20 We extracted 
DPI at the age of 30 from the Income Statistics Register avail-
able at Statistics Denmark21 and categorised this into quartiles 
by year according to the Danish population. DPI provided by 
Statistics Denmark consists of individual income such as pretax 
income, pensions, unemployment and cash benefits, and mirrors 
the available income for consumption and savings for the indi-
vidual after taxes and interest expenses.
Parental cancer
The Danish National Patient Registry was used to define 
parental cancer exposure.22 Children were considered having 
experienced parental cancer if at least one parent was diagnosed 
with cancer after childbirth and before the child’s 18th birthday. 
In analyses of primary school achievement, parental cancer was 
considered before the age of 15. The following cancer diagnoses 
were not included in the definition of parental cancer: N87.9, 
C44, D00-09 and D10-48.
In the initial analyses, parental cancer was modelled as a 
binary measure. In the additional analyses, we applied the 
following categorical secondary exposure-definitions to assess 
high-risk groups: gender of the parent with cancer, child’s age at 
the time of parental cancer diagnosis, 5-year prognosis of cancer 
type and parental death due to cancer. Cancer type was classified 
according to 5-year prognosis of the specific cancer type based 
on age-standardised survival estimates in the Nordic Cancer 
Registries,23 and divided into three categories: good (survival 
rate above 85%), intermediate (survival rate from 50% to 85%) 
and poor (survival rate below 50%). The Danish Register of 
Causes of Death was used to ascertain any parental deaths due 
to cancer and other causes, including date of death.24 Parentally 
bereaved children were maintained in the analyses.

Covariates
Covariates included child’s sex, year of birth, maternal and 
paternal age at childbirth, and parental education. To iden-
tify potential confounders we used the methods of causal 
diagrams.25 Parental education was based on the highest of the 
parent’s ongoing or completed education listed in the Danish 
Population’s Education Register, measured at childbirth.19 A 
priori, parental education was evaluated as a potential effect 
modifier. However, no interactions were found (pSP-I=0.460, 
pSP-II,education=0.892, pSP-II,DPI=0.777); thus, parental education was 
considered as a potential confounder. Furthermore, no interac-
tions between parental cancer and child’s sex were found (pSP-
I=0.214, pSP-II,education=0.880, pSP-II,DPI=0.686); therefore, boys 
and girls were maintained as one group.
statistical analyses
All statistical procedures were performed using STATA V
.14.2. 
Potential confounders in the models were maternal and paternal 
age at childbirth and parental education. Furthermore, we 
adjusted for trend by calendar year (year of birth). The depen-
dency between siblings in the sample was taken into account by 
applying a robust SE estimator. Children without parental cancer 
were considered the reference group in all statistical models. To 
examine the effect of parental cancer on primary school achieve-
ment, we applied a general linear model (GLM), modelling GPA 
as a continuous variable. Beta estimates and their corresponding 
95% CIs were calculated. Furthermore, primary school achieve-
ment was analysed as a binary outcome, higher and lower than 
the average of the study population (GPA=6.37), using binary 
logistic regression. The association between parental cancer and 
educational attainment at the age of 30 was assessed by multino-
mial logistic regression and reported as relative risk ratios with 
95% 
CIs. High educational level was considered as reference. 
DPI was analysed in the same way as educational attainment, 
and DPI in the fourth (highest) quartile was considered as refer-
ence. In addition, for all outcomes the associations were studied 
according to the secondary exposure-definitions explained 
above.
resuLTs
Table 1 shows the characteristics of the study populations with 
similar tendencies paralleling SP-I and SP-II. Of the included indi-
viduals, 4%–5% had experienced parental cancer (table 1). Chil-
dren with parental cancer differed statistically from their peers 
without parental cancer in terms of higher parental education 
and higher maternal and paternal age at childbirth. A slightly 
higher proportion of parental cancer occurred among mothers 
(online supplementary file 1). Approximately, half of the parents 
with cancer had a cancer type with a good 5-year prognosis. 
Common cancer diagnoses among mothers included cancer 
of the breast, cervix, uterus, ovary and melanoma, and among 
fathers genitourinary, colon and respiratory system cancers in 
addition to melanoma (online supplementary file 2).
Primary school achievement
On average, children with parental cancer achieved a GPA of 
6.48 
(95%

research report
cancer achieved a GPA of 6.37 (95% 
CI 6.36 to 6.37) in their 
final examinations and teacher evaluation grades (p<0.001). 
This grading difference existed almost equally for both boys 
and girls. However, the GPA among girls was higher compared 
with boys (data not shown). Results from the adjusted GLM 
showed an inverse association of the crude estimates; children 
with parental cancer had a slightly but statistically significantly 
lower GPA than their peers without parental cancer (table 2). 
Furthermore, we found an even lower GPA if the cancer type 
was of poor 5-year prognosis or if the parent died of cancer. 
Conversely, we found a slightly higher GPA in children 
with parental cancer if the 5-year prognosis was good or if the 
parent was alive at the child’s 15th birthday.
Examining the associations using binary logistic regression, we 
observed similar findings to the GLM; the risk of having a GPA 
below the average was slightly higher among children affected 
by parental cancer (OR: 1.05; 95% 
CI 1.02 to 1.08), whereas 
the estimates were substantially higher in the case of poor 5-year 
prognosis (OR: 1.25; 95% 
CI 1.19 to 1.32) and parental death 
due to cancer (OR: 1.30; 95% 
CI 1.23 to 1.37) (data not shown).
educational attainment
We found no association between the experience of parental 
cancer and educational attainment at the age of 30 in the crude 
model. By contrast, in the adjusted model, parental cancer was 
associated with a higher risk of attaining low educational level 
relative to high, and a slightly higher risk of attaining medium 
educational level (table 3). When analysing the association using 
the secondary exposure-definitions of parental cancer, we found 
an extended risk of attaining the lowest educational level relative 
to the highest if it was the father who had cancer. Further, if the 
parental cancer type was of poor 5-year prognosis, we found a 
52% (95% CI 39 to 66) increased risk of attaining the lowest 
educational level and a 61% (95% CI 49 to 75) increased risk if 
the parent died of cancer. No associations were observed when 
a parent had a good 5-year prognosis or was alive at the child’s 
18th birthday.
disposable personal income
In the adjusted model of parental cancer exposure and DPI 
at the age of 30, parental cancer was not strongly associated with 
an increased risk of attaining the third or second income quar-
tile. However, a moderately increased risk of attaining a DPI 
within the first (lowest) quartile relative to the fourth quartile 
was observed (table 4). The high-risk groups appeared in accor-
dance with analyses of educational attainments, accompanied by 
individuals 0–4 
years of age at parental cancer diagnosis.
dIsCussIon
In this nationwide register-based study of long-term educational 
and socioeconomic attainments in children with parental cancer, 
parental cancer was related to a small attenuation in GPA in 
ninth grade, and a higher risk of attaining low educational level 
and being in the lowest income quartile at the age of 30. All asso-
ciations were substantially stronger for children having a parent 
with a more severe cancer type or parental death due to cancer.
Generally, the crude estimates differed markedly from the 
adjusted estimates. Presumably, this is a result of the positive 
social gradient in cancer in the reproductive age and the strong 
intergenerational relation between parental and offspring educa-
tional achievement.15 26–28 It has been shown that children of 
low SEP have fewer resources to deal with chronically parental 
illness than children of high SEP
, which may explain increased 
child adjustment difficulties among children of low SEP
.29 Addi-
tionally, children growing up in disadvantaged circumstances 
may be more vulnerable and more likely to be exposed to several 
risk factors (physical, social and behavioural), which can interact 
so that the effect of a particular risk factor may have a stronger 
effect in more disadvantaged populations.16 However, we found 
no effect modification of parental education, assuming the same 
relative effect of parental cancer across social groups.
Children’s academic performance in case of parental cancer 
may be impacted due to poor general health, loss of motivation 
and diversion in attention, absence from school, and a lowering 
of cognitive pace caused by depressive symptoms.7 30 Lack of 
social support and caregiving from parents and lack of a proper 
safety net to compensate for missed schoolwork and learning 
have also been associated with attenuated academic perfor-
mance.29–33 Our results regarding GPA are in accordance with 
a study among children aged 10–20 
years old of chronically ill 
parents suggesting a lower self-reported GPA compared with 
children of healthy parents.33 However, in our study the atten-
uation in GPA was mostly profound in subgroups of children 
whose parent had a severe cancer type or if the parent died of 
cancer.
In a life course perspective, exposures may operate through 
timing of their actions.34 Our results indicated that the group of 
children in the age range of 0–4 
years at parental cancer diag-
nosis was at the highest risk of lower socioeconomic attainment, 
suggesting that the effect of parental cancer in early childhood 
may be prolonged over a life course. This was also suggested in 
a UK study investigating school performance in children who 
had lost a parent or sibling, where children below the age of 5 
were affected in particular.35 The influence of exposures acting 
during critical or sensitive periods of susceptibility may also be 
modified by accumulation of later-in-life exposures, whereby the 
health effects are added to or are interacting with each other.36 
Among children of patients with cancer, it seems reasonable that 
several accumulated influences will happen during childhood 
and adolescence due to parental cancer-related conditions.2 In 
a life course perspective, parental cancer in childhood could be 
considered as a potential early life stressor that may increase 
the health vulnerability to later-in-life exposures, expanding the 
risk of later social disadvantages and poor adult health.16 28 36 
Additionally, parental cancer specifically in the case of severe 
cancer or parental death may represent a major public health 
challenge.28 34
strengths and limitations
Our study has several strengths. The prospective study design 
ensured temporality between parental cancer exposure and 
subsequent outcomes. Furthermore, retrieving independently 
collected information from Danish nationwide registries allowing 
comprehensive long-term follow-up and the large representative 
sample size strengthened the validity of the study. Additionally, 
the use of register information, including individually linkage 
of information, minimised the risk of selection bias and recall 
bias.18 37
However, there are some limitations to this work. Missing or 
limited information on school grades on 11% of the children 
may indicate children failing to complete ninth grade, schooling 
outside of Denmark or attendance at schools without examina-
tion and grade traditions, for example, Rudolf Steiner schools. 
This may have introduced selection bias; however, for the two 
latter, we have no reason to believe that parental cancer should 
be more frequent among these children.

research report
We were capable of adjusting for several potential confounders; 
however, some confounding may still exist.38 Parental education 
was chosen to represent the SEP of the family, and this measure 
may not encompass the entirety of the effect of SEP on health 
and social issues.15 In light of the Danish welfare state providing 
relatively equal access to free education and healthcare,39 we do 
not consider parental income or employment as crucial potential 
confounders affecting the estimated associations further.
We found that parental cancer negatively affected educational 
attainment. Within a life course perspective, education can be 
conceptualised as an indicator of early life measure of SEP since 
formal education is usually completed in young adulthood.15 
However, there is no single best indicator of SEP
, and applica-
bility may depend on the study aim of which the particular choice 
of SEP measure should relate to the stage of life.15 Income is a 
measure of SEP most directly corresponding to material resources 
component. Income typically follows a curvilinear trajectory with 
age, such that income for younger adults may be less reliable indi-
cating their true SEP
.15 To strengthen the income measure, it may 
be of interest to extend the follow-up to an older age, allowing 
the sample reasonable time to complete an education and secure 
employment. However, as Danish registries were established in 
1978 at first, postponing the follow-up time would have limited 
the sample size substantially.
The validity and completeness of cancer diagnoses in the National 
Patient Registry are high and in close consistency to the Danish 
Cancer Registry, supporting the validity of the exposure measure.22 
However, a shortcoming of this work is the complexity of the 
underlying constructs of the parental cancer exposure measures, 
potentially implying a risk of non-differential misclassification of 
the estimated associations.
During the follow-up period, changes in education and 
medical care occurred, which is a common limitation in studies 
with long-term follow-up. Taking this concern into account, 
analyses were adjusted for calendar year.
The recently proposed national recommendations by the Danish 
Health Authority (2012) state that children of severely ill parents 
should receive more attention and to a greater extent be involved 
in the course of parental disease.10 In the future, children may 
potentially benefit from the increased attention recommended in 
this guidance. However, a Danish ethnographical study suggested 
that health workers did not comply with these recommendations.40 
In Norway, Sweden and Finland a systematic registration of chil-
dren and their vulnerability is a legal requirement. In a Danish 
context it may be debatable whether the existing recommendations 
are sufficient or whether further legislation is needed.
ConCLusIon
Our population-based study showed a small attenuation in 
the final GPA in ninth grade among children whose parents had 
a severe cancer diagnosis or died of cancer. In addition, this study 
provides evidence that children with parental cancer were nega-
tively affected socioeconomically in terms of lower educational 
attainment and DPI in young adulthood. The risk of attenuated 
educational attainment and income appeared stronger in the case 
of severe parental cancer or parental death due to cancer. These 
findings may indicate that some children who experience parental 
cancer would benefit from appropriate support and early educa-
tional rehabilitation in teenage years.
Correction notice This article has been corrected since it first published online. In 
table 1, column ’no parental cancer’ the percentage for ’medium education’ should 
be 47.7 (instead of 45.1) and the percentage for ’low education’ should be 20.9 
(instead of 20.5).
