IMPORTANCE A deep learning system (DLS) is a machine learning technology with potential
for screening diabetic retinopathy and related eye diseases.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the performance of a DLS in detecting referable diabetic retinopathy,
vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, possible glaucoma, and age-related macular
degeneration (AMD) in community and clinic-based multiethnic populations with diabetes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Diagnostic performance of a DLS for diabetic retinopathy
and related eye diseases was evaluated using 494 661 retinal images. A DLS was trained for
detecting diabetic retinopathy (using 76 370 images), possible glaucoma (125 189 images), and
AMD (72 610 images), and performance of DLS was evaluated for detecting diabetic retinopathy
(using 112 648 images), possible glaucoma (71 896 images), and AMD (35 948 images). Training
of the DLS was completed in May 2016, and validation of the DLS was completed in May 2017 for
detection of referable diabetic retinopathy (moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy or
worse) and vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy
or worse) using a primary validation data set in the Singapore National Diabetic Retinopathy
Screening Program and 10 multiethnic cohorts with diabetes.
EXPOSURES Use of a deep learning system.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUC) and sensitivity and specificity of the DLS with professional graders (retinal specialists,
general ophthalmologists, trained graders, or optometrists) as the reference standard.
RESULTS In the primary validation dataset (n = 14 880 patients; 71 896 images; mean [SD]
age, 60.2 [2.2] years; 54.6% men), the prevalence of referable diabetic retinopathy was
3.0%; vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, 0.6%; possible glaucoma, 0.1%; and AMD,
2.5%. The AUC of the DLS for referable diabetic retinopathy was 0.936 (95% CI,
0.925-0.943), sensitivity was 90.5% (95% CI, 87.3%-93.0%), and specificity was 91.6%
(95% CI, 91.0%-92.2%). For vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, AUC was 0.958 (95% CI,
0.956-0.961), sensitivity was 100% (95% CI, 94.1%-100.0%), and specificity was 91.1% (95%
CI, 90.7%-91.4%). For possible glaucoma, AUC was 0.942 (95% CI, 0.929-0.954), sensitivity
was 96.4% (95% CI, 81.7%-99.9%), and specificity was 87.2% (95% CI, 86.8%-87.5%). For
AMD, AUC was 0.931 (95% CI, 0.928-0.935), sensitivity was 93.2% (95% CI, 91.1%-99.8%),
and specificity was 88.7% (95% CI, 88.3%-89.0%). For referable diabetic retinopathy in the
10 additional datasets, AUC range was 0.889 to 0.983 (n = 40 752 images).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this evaluation of retinal images from multiethnic cohorts of
patients with diabetes, the DLS had high sensitivity and specificity for identifying diabetic
retinopathy and related eye diseases. Further research is necessary to evaluate the applicability
of the DLS in health care settings and the utility of the DLS to improve vision outcomes.

y 2040, it is projected that approximately 600 million
people will have diabetes, with one-third expected to
have diabetic retinopathy.1-3 Screening for diabetic reti-
nopathy, coupled with timely referral and treatment, is a uni-
versally accepted strategy for blindness prevention.2 How-
ever, programs for screening diabetic retinopathy are
challenged by issues related to implementation, availability of
human assessors, and long-term financial sustainability.2,4-7
A deep learning system (DLS) uses artificial intelligence
and representation learning methods to process large
data and extract meaningful patterns.8,9 A few DLSs have re-
cently shown high sensitivity and specificity (>90%) in
detecting referable diabetic retinopathy from retinal photo-
graphs, primarily using high-quality images from publicly
available databases from homogenous populations of white
individuals.10-12 The performance of a DLS in screening for
diabetic retinopathy should ideally be evaluated in clinical or
population settings in which retinal images from patients of
different races and ethnicities (and therefore with varying
fundi pigmentation) have varying qualities (eg, due to poor
pupil dilation, media opacity, poor contrast or focus).13,14
Furthermore, in screening programs for diabetic retinopathy,
the detection of incidental but related vision-threatening eye
diseases, such as glaucoma and age-related macular degen-
eration (AMD), should be incorporated because missing such
cases is clinically unacceptable.15
The primary aim of this study was to train and vali-
date a DLS to detect referable diabetic retinopathy, vision-
threatening diabetic retinopathy, and related eye diseases
(referable possible glaucoma and referable AMD) by evaluat-
ing retinal images obtained primarily from patients with
diabetes in an ongoing community-based national diabetic
retinopathy screening program in Singapore, with further
external validation on referable diabetic retinopathy in 10
additional multiethnic datasets from different countries
with diverse community- and clinic-based populations
with diabetes. The secondary aim was to determine how the
DLS could fit in 2 potential models of diabetic retinopathy
screening—a fully automated model for communities with
no existing screening programs and a semiautomated model
in which referable cases from the DLS undergo a secondary
assessment by human graders.
Methods
This study was approved by the centralized institutional
review board (IRB) of SingHealth, Singapore (protocol
SHF/FG648S/2015) and conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki. Information on race/ethnicity was col-
lected to evaluate the consistency of DLS diagnostic perfor-
mance across races/ethnicities. Patients’informed consent
was exempted by the IRB because of the retrospective nature
of study using fully anonymized retinal images.
Training Datasets of the DLS
The DLS for referable diabetic retinopathy was developed
and trained using retinal images of patients with diabetes
who participated in the ongoing Singapore National Diabetic
Retinopathy Screening Program (SIDRP) between 2010
and 2013 (SIDRP 2010-2013; Table 1 and Table 2). The SIDRP
was established from 2010, progressively covered all 18 pri-
mary care clinics across Singapore, and screened half of the
diabetes population by 2015.16 SIDRP uses digital retinal pho-
tography, a tele-ophthalmology platform, and assessment of
diabetic retinopathy by a team of trained professional grad-
ers. For each patient, 2 retinal photographs (optic disc and
fovea) were taken of each eye. All trained graders received 3
to 6 months of training before certification and underwent
annual reaccreditation. Specifically for this study, in the
training set (SIDRP 2010-2013), each retinal image was ana-
lyzed by 2 trained senior certified nonmedical professional
graders (>5 years’experience)17; if there were discordant
findings between the nonmedical professional graders, arbi-
tration was performed by a retinal specialist (PhD-trained
with >5 years’experience in conducting diabetic retinopathy
assessment) to generate final grading.
For referable possible glaucoma and AMD, the DLS was
trained using images from SIDRP 2010-2013 and several ad-
ditional population- and clinic-based studies of patients
with glaucoma and AMD (Table 1; eTable 1 in the Sup-
plement).17-20,22,23,25-29
Architecture of the DLS
The DLS consisted of a convolutional neural network to
implicitly recognize characteristics of referable diabetic reti-
nopathy, possible glaucoma, and AMD from the appearance
in retinal images. Training of the DLS entailed exposure of
multiple examples of retinal images (with and without each
of the 3 conditions) to the neural networks, allowing the net-
works to gradually adapt their weight parameters to model
and differentiate between conditions. Once the training was
complete, the DLS could be used to classify unseen images.
Technical details are shown in eFigure 1 in the Supplement.

Key Points
Question How does a deep learning system (DLS) using artificial
intelligence compare with professional human graders in
identifying diabetic retinopathy and related eye diseases using
retinal images from multiethnic populations with diabetes?
Findings In the primary validation dataset (71 896 images;
14 880 patients), the DLS had a sensitivity of 90.5% and
specificity of 91.6% for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy;
100% sensitivity and 91.1% specificity for vision-threatening
diabetic retinopathy; 96.4% sensitivity and 87.2% specificity
for possible glaucoma; and 93.2% sensitivity and 88.7%
specificity for age-related macular degeneration, compared with
professional graders.
Meaning The DLS had high sensitivity and specificity for
identifying diabetic retinopathy and related eye diseases using
retinal images from multiethnic populations with diabetes.

 same SIDRP among patients seen between 2014 and 2015
(SIDRP 2014-2015). The primary analysis was to determine
if the DLS was equivalent or better than 2 trained senior
nonmedical professional graders (>5 years’experience) cur-
rently employed in the SIDRP in detecting referable diabetic
retinopathy and vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy,
with reference to a retinal specialist (>5 years’experience in
diabetic retinopathy grading).
The DLS was then externally validated using 10 addi-
tional multiethnic cohorts of participants with diabetes from
different settings (community, population-based, and clinic-
based). A range of retinal cameras were used, and assess-
ment of diabetic retinopathy was facilitated by retinal spe-
cialists, general ophthalmologists, trained nonmedical
professional graders, or optometrists across the cohorts
(Table 1). All retinal images were captured with JPEG com-
pression format (resolutions 5-7 megapixels, except for
images of eyes in the Hispanic cohort [<1 megapixel]).

Definition of Referable Diabetic Retinopathy,
Vision-Threatening Diabetic Retinopathy,
Referable Possible Glaucoma, and Referable AMD
Diabetic retinopathy levels from all retinal images were
defined using the International Classification Diabetic Reti-
nopathy Scale.30 Referable diabetic retinopathy was defined
as a diabetic retinopathy severity level of moderate nonpro-
liferative diabetic retinopathy or worse, diabetic macular
edema, and/or ungradable image. Vision-threatening dia-
betic retinopathy was defined as severe nonproliferative
diabetic retinopathy and proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
Diabetic macular edema was assessed as present if hard
exudates were detected at the posterior pole of the retinal
images. If more than one-third of the photograph was
obscured, it was considered ungradable and the individual
was considered referable. Referable possible glaucoma was
defined as a ratio of vertical cup to disc diameter of 0.8

 or greater, focal thinning or notching of the neuroretinal
rim, optic disc hemorrhages, or localized retinal nerve fiber
layer defects—features sometimes referred to as glaucoma
suspects. Referable AMD was defined as the presence of
intermediate AMD (numerous medium-sized drusen, 1 large
drusen ≥125 μm in greatest linear diameter, noncentral geo-
graphical atrophy, and/or advanced AMD [central geographi-
cal atrophy or neovascular AMD]) according to the Age-
Related Eye Disease Study grading system.31
Reference Standards
For the primary validation dataset (SIDRP 2014-2015),
the reference standard was grading by a retinal specialist
(>5 years’ experience in conducting diabetic retinopathy
assessment) who was masked to the grading of the trained
nonmedical professional graders. For all other retinal
images from the 10 external validation datasets, reference
standards were based on individual studies’assessment of
diabetic retinopathy, which was based on retinal specialists,
general ophthalmologists, trained nonmedical professional
graders, or optometrists (Table 1). The DLS performance for
identifying referable diabetic retinopathy in the 10 external
validation datasets was compared against these reference
standards. For the analysis on referable possible glaucoma
and referable AMD, the reference standard was the retinal
specialist (Table 1).
Statistical Analysis
Initially the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver oper-
ating characteristic (ROC) curve of DLS was calculated on
the training dataset of the SIDRP 2010-2013 across a range
of classification thresholds, and one was selected that
achieved a predetermined optimal sensitivity of 90% for
detecting referable diabetic retinopathy, vision-threatening
diabetic retinopathy, referable possible glaucoma, and refer-
able AMD. For diabetic retinopathy screening, international
guidelines recommended a minimum sensitivity of 60%
(Australia) to 80% (United Kingdom).32,33 In Singapore, the
DLS sensitivity was preset at 90% based on the trained pro-
fessional graders’past performances and criteria set by the
Ministry of Health, Singapore. The hypothesis determined
was that the DLS was at least comparable to the professional
graders’performance.
Primary analysis was to evaluate the performance of the
DLS in the setting of the ongoing SIDRP 2014-2015 (the pri-
mary validation set) by determining whether the DLS was
equivalent or superior to professional graders in the screen-
ing program. Thus, the AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of the
DLS vs the professional graders in detecting referable dia-
betic retinopathy and vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy
was computed to the reference standard (retinal specialist)
at individual-eye levels.
Next, the following subsidiary analyses were performed:
(1) the analyses were repeated excluding patients who
appeared in both the SIDRP 2010-2013 training set and the
primary validation set of SIDRP 2014-2015 (n = 6291 seen
more than once in SIDRP), with the patient treated as having
referable diabetic retinopathy if either eye had referable dia-
betic retinopathy; (2) performance of the DLS was evaluated
using higher-quality images with no media opacity (eg, cata-
racts) as noted by professional graders; (3) AUC subgroups
were computed stratified by age, sex, and glycemic control;
and (4) the analysis was repeated by calculating the AUC,
sensitivity, and specificity of the DLS and the proportion of
concordant and discordant eyes on the 10 external validation
datasets, compared with the reference standards in these
studies (retinal specialists, general ophthalmologists, trained
graders, or optometrists; Table 1).
The DLS performance was then evaluated in detection of
referable possible glaucoma and referable AMD, with refer-
encetoaretinalspecialist,usingtheprimaryvalidationdataset
(SIDRP 2014-2015).

 For a secondary aim, an examination of how the DLS
could fit in 2 potential diabetic retinopathy screening mod-
els was performed: a fully-automated model for communi-
ties with no existing screening programs, vs a semiauto-
mated model in which referable cases from the DLS have a
secondary assessment by human graders—a method cur-
rently used in some communities and countries (eg, United
States, United Kingdom, and Singapore) (eFigure 2 in the
Supplement).32-35 For this analysis, in the fully-automated
model, eyes were considered referable if any one of the 3
conditions (referable diabetic retinopathy, referable possible
glaucoma, or referable AMD) were present. In the semiauto-
mated model, eyes classified as referable by the DLS would
undergo a secondary assessment by trained professional
graders to reclassify eyes if necessary. For semiautomated
models, evaluation was made of the proportion of images
requiring secondary assessment when presetting the DLS
sensitivity threshold at 90%, 95%, and 99% in detection of
referable status.

presented for proportions (sensitivity, specificity) and AUC,
respectively. In a few exceptional cases with estimate of sen-
sitivity at the boundary of 100%, the exact Clopper-Pearson
method was used instead to obtain CI estimates.36
All hypotheses tested were 2-sided, and a P value of less
than .05 was considered statistically significant. No adjust-
ment for multiple comparisons was made because the study
was restricted to a small number of planned comparisons. All
analyses were performed using Stata version 14 (StataCorp).
Results
From a total of 494 661 retinal images, the DLS was trained
for detection of referable diabetic retinopathy (using 76 370
images), referable possible glaucoma (using 125 189 images),
and referable AMD (using 72 610 images); performance of
the DLS was evaluated using 112 648 images for detection
of referable diabetic retinopathy, 71 896 images for referable
possible glaucoma, and 35 948 images for referable AMD.
All images were assembled between January 2016 and
March 2017 (Table 1), the DLS training was completed in
May 2016, and validation was completed in May 2017.
Among 76 370 images in the training dataset, 11.7% demon-
strated any diabetic retinopathy, 5.3% referable diabetic reti-
nopathy, and 1.5% vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy.
In the primary validation dataset, estimates were 8.0% for
having any diabetic retinopathy, 3.0% for referable diabetic
retinopathy, and 0.6% for vision-threatening diabetic reti-
nopathy (n = 71 896 images). In the 10 external validation
datasets, estimates were 35.3% for any diabetic retinopathy,
15.4% for referable diabetic retinopathy, and 3.4% for vision-
threatening diabetic retinopathy (n = 40 752 images; Table 2).
For possible glaucoma, 2630 images (1907 eyes) were consid-
ered referable; for AMD, 2900 images (1017 eyes) were con-
sidered referable (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
The overall patients demographics, diabetes history, and
systemic risk factors of the training and validation datasets
are listed in Table 3 (SIDRP 2010-2013 and SIDRP 2014-2015,
primary validation set) and eTable 2 in the Supplement
(10 external validation datasets for referable diabetic reti-
nopathy and training datasets for referable possible glau-
coma and referable AMD).
The diagnostic performance of the DLS as compared with
trained professional graders, both with reference to the reti-
nal specialist standard using this primary validation dataset,
is shown in Table 4. The AUC of the DLS was 0.936 for refer-
able diabetic retinopathy and 0.958 for vision-threatening
diabetic retinopathy (Figure 1). Sensitivity of the DLS in
detecting referable diabetic retinopathy was comparable with
that of trained graders (90.5% vs 91.1%; P = .68), although the

 graders had higher specificity (91.6% vs 99.3%; P < .001)
(Table 4; Figure 1). For vision-threatening diabetic retinopa-
thy, the DLS had higher sensitivity compared with trained
graders (100% vs 88.5%; P < .001), but lower specificity
(91.1% vs 99.6%; P < .001). Among eyes with referable dia-
betic retinopathy, the sensitivity of diabetic macular edema
was 92.1% for the DLS and 98.2% for professional graders.
Five subsidiary analyses were performed. First, the DLS
showed similar diagnostic performance in 8589 unique
patients of SIDRP 2014-2015 (with no overlap with training
set) as in the primary analysis (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Second, in a subset of 97.4% eyes (n = 35 055) with excellent
retinal image quality (no media opacity), the AUC of the
DLS for referable diabetic retinopathy increased to 0.949
(95% CI, 0.940-0.957); for vision-threatening diabetic
retinopathy, it increased to 0.970 (0.968-0.973). Third, the
DLS showed comparable performance in different sub-
groups of patients stratified by age, sex, and glycemic con-
trol (Figure 2).
Fourth, the DLS showed clinically acceptable perfor-
mance (sensitivity ≥90%) for referable diabetic retinopathy
with respect to multiethnic populations of different commu-
nities, clinics, and settings (Table 5). Among the 10 external
validation datasets, the AUC of referable diabetic retinopathy
ranged from 0.889 to 0.983. The DLS showed clinically
acceptable AUCs of greater than 0.90 for different cameras
(eg, FundusVue, Canon, Topcon, and Carl Zeiss). Most
datasets (except for Singapore Chinese, Malay, and Indian
patients) had more than 80% concordance between the DLS
and trained professional graders, with sensitivity of more

ists, general ophthalmologists, trained graders, or optom-

Fifth, for referable possible glaucoma, the AUC of the DLS
was 0.942 (95% CI, 0.929-0.954), sensitivity was 96.4% (95%
CI, 81.7%-99.9%), and specificity was 87.2% (86.8%-87.5%);

was 88.7% (95% CI, 88.3%-89.0%) (Figure 3).
For the secondary aim, we evaluated the performance of
the DLS in 2 diabetic retinopathy screening models (eFigure 2
in the Supplement): the fully- automated model had sensitiv-
ity of 93.0% (95% CI, 91.5%-94.3%) and specificity of 77.5%
(95% CI, 77.0%-77.9%) to detect overall referable cases (refer-
able diabetic retinopathy, possible glaucoma, or AMD), while
the semiautomated model (DLS followed by graders) had
sensitivity of 91.3% (95% CI, 89.7%-92.8%) and specificity of
99.5% (95% CI, 99.5%-99.6%) to detect overall referable sta-
tus. The performance of different semiautomated models
with a preset sensitivity threshold of 90%, 95%, and 99% are
shown in eTable 4 in the Supplement.

 identifying referable diabetic retinopathy and vision-
threatening diabetic retinopathy, as well as for identifying
related eye diseases, including referable possible glaucoma
and referable age-related macular degeneration. The perfor-
mance of the DLS was comparable and clinically acceptable
to the current model based on assessment of retinal images
by trained professional graders and showed consistency in
10 external validation datasets of multiple ethnicities and
settings, using diverse reference standards in assessment of
diabetic retinopathy by professional graders, optometrists,
or retinal specialists. This study also examined how the DLS
could be deployed in 2 common diabetic retinopathy screen-
ing models: a “fully-automated” screening model that
showed clinically acceptable performance to detect all 3 con-
ditions, useful in communities without any existing diabetic
retinopathy screening programs; and a “semi-automated”
model in which diabetic retinopathy screening programs
using trained professional graders already exist, and the DLS
could be incorporated.
There have been previous studies of automated soft-
ware for diabetic retinopathy screening14,37,38; most recent
ones used a DLS.10-12 Gulshan et al10 reported a DLS with
high sensitivity and specificity (>90%) and an AUC of 0.99
for referable diabetic retinopathy using approximately
10 000 images retrieved from 2 publicly available databases
(EyePAC-1 and Messidor-2). Similarly, Gargeya and Leng11
showed optimal DLS diagnostic performance in detecting
any diabetic retinopathy using 2 other public databases
(Messidor-2 and E-Ophtha). To facilitate translation, it is
important to develop and test the DLS in clinical scenarios
using diverse retinal images of varying quality from different
camera types and in representative diabetic retinopathy
screening populations.13 The current study therefore sub-
stantially added to other current studies.
First, the DLS was trained to also detect other related eye
diseases including referable possible glaucoma and referable
AMD in addition to diabetic retinopathy. Second, the training
and validation data sets were substantially larger (nearly

 500 000 images) and included images from patients of
diverse racial and ethnic groups (ie, darker fundus pigmenta-
tion in African American and Indian individuals to lighter
fundus in white individuals). The DLS showed consistent
diagnostic performance across images of varying quality and
different camera types, and across patients with varying sys-
temic glycemic control level.
Third, primary validation of the DLS was conducted in an
ongoing diabetic retinopathy screening program in which
there were poorer quality images, including ungradable ones.
This results in somewhat lower performance of the DLS
(AUC, 0.936) than the system by Gulshan et al that used
higher-quality images.10 Fourth, this study also had fewer
cases of severe disease (eg, vision-threatening diabetic reti-
nopathy, referable possible glaucoma, and referable AMD),
but this is more representative of populations for routine dia-
betic retinopathy screening.39
To ensure no degradation in health outcomes, a thresh-
old was set to ensure false-negative rates were no worse than
human assessment by trained professional graders. Although
the results suggest that professional nonmedical graders may
outperform the DLS (with high specificity of 99% for refer-
able diabetic retinopathy and vision-threatening diabetic
retinopathy), given the very low marginal cost of the DLS, the
low prevalence rate of the conditions in the target screening
population (<5%), and equality in health outcomes, the DLS
could be used with a semiautomated model in which first-
line screening with the DLS is followed by human assessment
for patients who test positive. This will allow increasing
screening episodes with lower cost and no degradation in
health outcomes.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the training set was
not developed entirely based on the retinal specialists’grad-
ing for all images. Although the reference standard in the pri-
mary validation dataset used grading by a retinal specialist,
reference standards for the external datasets were based on
varying assessment by retinal specialists, general ophthal-
mologists, trained graders, or optometrists. The performance
of the DLS may potentially be further improved if all images
in the training and validation data sets had criterion standard
references evaluated by the retinal specialists. Nevertheless,
the diagnostic performance of the DLS remained clinically
acceptable and highly reproducible in both the primary vali-
dation data set and in the 10 external datasets in which the
reference standards vary depending on whether the images
were evaluated by retinal specialists (African American,
Mexican, Hong Kong Chinese), general ophthalmologists
(Beijing Chinese), optometrists (Hong Kong Chinese) or pro-
fessional nonmedical graders (the remaining datasets) from
the different countries (Table 5).
Second, the DLS uses multiple levels of representation
to analyze each retinal image without showing the actual

Eyes are the units of analysis. Cluster-bootstrap biased-corrected 95% CI was
computed for each area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUC), with individual patients as the bootstrap sampling clusters. Referable
possible glaucoma defined as ratio of vertical cup to disc diameter of 0.8 or
greater, focal thinning or notching of the neuroretinal rim, optic disc
hemorrhages, or localized retinal nerve fiber layer defects. Referable acute
macular degeneration (AMD) defined as the presence of intermediate AMD
(numerous intermediate drusens, 1 large drusen >125um) and/or advanced
AMD, geographic atrophy, or neovascular AMD, using the Age-Related Eye
Disease Study grading system.30 Repeats from the Singapore National Diabetes
Retinopathy Screening Program (SIDRP) 2014-2015 were excluded from the
analysis. Asymptotic 95% CI was computed for the logit of each proportion and
using the cluster sandwich estimator of standard error to account for possible
dependency of eyes within each individual. Cluster-bootstrap biased-corrected
95% CI was computed for each AUC, with individual patients as the bootstrap
sampling clusters.

 diabetic retinopathy lesions (eg, microaneurysms, retinal
hemorrhages). These data points can possibly be the shape or
contour of the optic disc or tortuosity or caliber of the retinal
vessels. Such black-box issues may have an effect on physi-
cians’acceptance for clinical use.13
Third, identification of diabetic macular edema from
fundus photographs may not identify all cases appropri-
ately without clinical examination and optical coherence
tomography.
Conclusions
In this evaluation of retinal images from multiethnic
cohorts of patients with diabetes, the DLS had high sensitiv-
ity and specificity for identifying diabetic retinopathy and
related eye diseases. Further research is necessary to evalu-
ate the applicability of the DLS in health care settings and
the utility of the DLS to improve vision outcomes.
