Abstract
Background: Newborn telomere length sets telomere length for later life. At birth, telomere length is highly
variable among newborns and the environmental factors during in utero life for this observation remain largely
unidentified. Obesity during pregnancy might reflect an adverse nutritional status affecting pregnancy and offspring
outcomes, but the association of maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) with newborn telomere length, as
a mechanism of maternal obesity, on the next generation has not been addressed.
Methods: Average relative telomere lengths were measured in cord blood (n = 743) and placental tissue (n = 702)
samples using a quantitative real-time PCR method from newborns from the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort in Belgium.
By using univariate and multivariable adjusted linear regression models we addressed the associations between
pre-pregnancy BMI and cord blood and placental telomere lengths.
Results: Maternal age was 29.1 years (range, 17–44) and mean (SD) pre-pregnancy BMI was 24.1 (4.1) kg/m2. Decline
in newborn telomere length occurred in parallel with higher maternal pre-pregnancy BMI. Independent of maternal
and paternal age at birth, maternal education, gestational age, newborn gender, ethnicity, birthweight, maternal
smoking status, parity, cesarean section, and pregnancy complications, each kg/m2 increase in pre-pregnancy BMI
was associated with a −0.50 % (95 % CI, −0.83 to −0.17 %; P = 0.003) shorter cord blood telomere length and a −0.66 %
(95 % CI, −1.06 to −0.25 %; P = 0.002) shorter placental telomere length.
Conclusions: Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI is associated with shorter newborn telomere lengths as reflected by cord
blood and placental telomeres. These findings support the benefits of a pre-pregnancy healthy weight for promoting
molecular longevity from early life onwards.

Background
The prevalence of overweight and obesity is rising
worldwide, including in women of reproductive age. Ma-
ternal overweight and obesity are well-known risk fac-
tors for adverse pregnancy outcomes and maternal body
mass index (BMI) is also associated with maternal blood
glucose levels during pregnancy [1]. Higher risks for
pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia [2], ges-
tational diabetes [3], hypertensive disorders [4], and
cesarean delivery [5], have been associated with maternal
obesity. Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures contain-
ing TTAGGG repeats at the end of the chromosomes.
They are important in maintaining genomic stability and
protect chromosomes from end-to-end fusion and deg-
radation [6]. Telomere length is considered a biomarker of
biological ageing and has been associated with age-related
diseases such as cardiovascular disease [7, 8], type 2 dia-
betes [9], atherosclerosis [10, 11], and increased mortality
[12–14]. Telomere length variability and attrition rate has
been explained by heritability and by different environ-
mental determinants [15–19]. Even at birth newborn telo-
mere lengths are highly variable [20, 21] and the rate of
telomere shortening is higher during the first 4 years of
life compared to later life [22].
Environmental factors during in utero life that poten-
tially explain the observed telomere length variability
in newborns remain largely unidentified since large
population-based studies of telomere lengths in relation

 with environmental factors and age-related diseases have
traditionally recruited middle-aged subjects [23, 24].
Nevertheless, interest of in utero factors (physiological, so-
cial, environmental, demographical, and clinical exposures
during pregnancy) in relation to newborn telomere biol-
ogy is rising [24]. Indeed, recent studies have shown that
newborn telomere length is influenced by intrauterine ef-
fects such as exposure to maternal stress [25, 26], mater-
nal smoking [27], maternal education [28], maternal folate
concentrations
[29],
pre-eclampsia,
and
intrauterine
growth restriction [30, 31], as well as by diabetes during
pregnancy [32]. These findings reflect the importance of
in utero and early life exposures in the determination of
initial telomere lengths at birth and show that these expo-
sures may have an impact on ageing, disease susceptibility,
and molecular longevity later in life. Telomere length in
adulthood is associated with BMI [33], but the influence
of pre-pregnancy weight through the intrauterine environ-
ment on telomere length has not been addressed. Mater-
nal undernutrition during in utero development of the
fetus has been associated with coronary heart disorders
[34], increased BMI [35, 36], and hypertension [35, 37].
During pregnancy, maternal obesity might influence the
in utero environment, which can lead to altered fetal de-
velopment, physiology, and metabolism, potentially under-
lying the origin of later life diseases and possibly having an
impact on later life health [38]. Maternal obesity is associ-
ated with abnormal fetal growth [39], increased risks of
birth defects [40, 41], fetal death, still birth, and infant
death [42]. Later life health states, such as childhood obes-
ity [43], childhood asthma [44], and cardiovascular dis-
eases [45, 46], are associated with maternal obesity. These
observations are consistent with the developmental origin
of disease hypothesis [47]. We hypothesized that maternal
overweight and obesity during pregnancy might be im-
portant in setting telomere length at birth and may there-
fore contribute to the developmental programming of the
child. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the
possible effects of maternal obesity in a representative co-
hort of newborns on telomere length measured in fetal
cord blood DNA and placental DNA.
Methods
Study population and data collection
This study included 768 mother-newborn pairs (single-
tons) selected from the ongoing ENVIRONAGE (EN-
VIRonmental influence ON AGEing in early life) birth
cohort in the province of Limburg in Belgium. The study
protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of
Hasselt University and East-Limburg Hospital in Genk
(Belgium) and has been carried out according to the
declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was
obtained from all participating mothers. In total, 768
mothers with a singleton pregnancy and all with a pre-
pregnancy BMI below 40 kg/m2 were recruited from
February 1, 2010, to February 1, 2015, between Friday
1200 hours and Monday 0700 hours. The mother’s ability
to fill out questionnaires in Dutch was a criterion for se-
lection. The overall participation rate was 61 %. Because
DNA was missing or of bad quality for cord blood DNA
(n = 14) or for placental DNA (n = 57) or because telomere
length measurements were too variable between triplicate
measurements for cord blood telomere (n = 10) or placental
telomere (n = 8), and because of missing data on maternal
weight gain during pregnancy (n = 1), the final sample con-
sisted of 743 mother-newborn pairs to study associations
with cord blood telomere lengths and 702 mother-newborn
pairs to study associations with placental telomeres
(Additional file 1: Figure S1).
Data on maternal pre-pregnancy weight, weight before
delivery, and height were collected from the medical re-
cords at the hospital. Maternal height and weight were
measured without shoes, wearing light clothes to the
nearest centimeter and weight to the nearest 0.1 kg at
the first antenatal visit of each pregnancy (weeks 7–9 of
gestation). BMI was defined as weight in kilograms divided
by the square of height in meters. Gestational age was esti-
mated based on ultrasound data. Pre-pregnancy BMI was
categorized into three categories; normal was defined as
BMI below 25 kg/m2, overweight when BMI was greater
than or equal to 25 kg/m2 and below 30 kg/m2, and obese
was defined when BMI was greater than or equal to
30 kg/m2. Furthermore, the women were weighed on ad-
mission to the delivery ward. Maternal pregnancy weight
gain (weight before delivery minus pre-pregnancy weight)
was categorized according to the Institute of Medicine
guidelines – we defined insufficient and excessive gesta-
tional weight gain in relation to maternal pre-pregnancy
BMI (for underweight: total weight gain < 13 and > 18 kg;
normal weight: total weight gain < 11.5 and > 16.0 kg; for
overweight: total weight gain < 7.0 and > 11.5 kg; for obes-
ity: total weight gain < 5.0 and > 9.0 kg, respectively) [48].
Study questionnaires were completed in the post-delivery
ward to provide detailed information on maternal age,
paternal age, maternal education (as a measure for socio-
economic status), smoking status, parity, ethnicity, and
pregnancy complications. Maternal smoking status was
assessed as former smokers who had quit smoking before
pregnancy and smokers who continued smoking during
pregnancy. Maternal education was coded low when
mothers only went to primary school and did not obtain a
diploma, middle as they obtained a high school diploma
and high when they obtained a college or university degree.
Newborn’s ethnicity was classified as European-Cauca-
sian when two or more grandparents were European or
non-European when at least three grandparents were
of non-European origin. Information on pregnancy com-
plications were collected from the medical records for

 each mother. Pregnancy complications was coded as ab-
sent if mothers did not experience any pregnancy compli-
cations or as present if mothers experienced one or more
pregnancy complications. Included pregnancy complica-
tions were gestational diabetes, hypertension, infection
diseases, pre-eclampsia, vaginal bleeding, and hyper- or
hypothyroidism. Perinatal parameters were obtained after
birth such as birth date, newborn gender, birth weight,
and Apgar score. The ENVIRONAGE birth cohort is
generalizable to the gestational segment of the population
at large as it did not differ from all births in Flanders as to
maternal age, education, parity, newborn gender, ethnicity,
and birth weight (Additional file 1: Table S1) [49].
Cord blood and placental tissue collection
Umbilical cord blood was drawn immediately after deliv-
ery in BD Vacutainer® plastic whole blood tubes with
spray-coated K2EDTA (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).
Samples were centrifuged at 3200 rpm for 15 min and
blood tubes were stored at −80 °C. Buffy coat was re-
moved upon DNA extraction. Placentas were collected
and stored at −20 °C within 10 minutes after delivery. Pla-
cental biopsies were taken at the fetal site and stored at
−80 °C upon DNA extraction as described previously [50].
For each placenta, four different biopsies were taken at
four standardized sites across the middle region of the pla-
centa, at 4 cm approximately from the umbilical cord.
First, we determined within-placental average relative telo-
mere length variation in 14 different placentas based on
the four different biopsies. This average within placental
variation was 11.7 %. Because of the low variation in telo-
mere length within the placenta for different biopsies we
used only one biopsy (1–2 cm3) taken to the right of the
main artery for placental telomere length assessment.
Average relative telomere length measurement
DNA was extracted from cord blood buffy coat and pla-
cental tissue using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Inc., Venlo, The Netherlands). DNA quantity and purity
was assessed by a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer
(Isogen, Life Science, Belgium). DNA integrity was
assessed by agarose gel-electrophoresis. Average relative
telomere length was measured by a modified quantita-
tive real-time PCR (qPCR) protocol as described previ-
ously [51]. To ensure a uniform DNA input of 5 ng for
each qPCR reaction, samples were diluted and checked
using the Quant-iT™ PicoGreen® dsDNA Assay Kit (Life
Technologies, Europe). Telomere and single copy-gene re-
action mixture and PCR cycles used are given in Additional
file 1: Text S1. All measurements were performed in tripli-
cate on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems) in a 384-well format. On each run, a 6-point
serial dilution of pooled buffy coat or pooled placental
DNA was run to assess PCR efficiency as well as eight
inter-run calibrators to account for inter-run variability.
Relative average telomere lengths were calculated using
qBase software (Biogazelle, Zwijnaarde, Belgium) and were
expressed as the ratio of telomere copy number to single-
copy gene number (T/S) relative to the average T/S ratio of
the entire sample set. Before our study, we performed an
interlaboratory comparison of our telomere assay with a
US reference lab to standardize the protocol. We achieved
coefficients of variation (CV) within triplicates of the telo-
mere runs, single-copy gene runs, and T/S ratios of 0.68 %,
0.41 %, and 6.4 %, respectively, for cord blood telomeres.
For placental telomeres, we achieved CVs of 0.70 %,
0.45 %, and 6.9 %, for telomere runs, single-copy gene
runs, and T/S ratios, respectively.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using the SAS 9.3
statistical software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Continuous variables were tested for normality. Average
relative cord blood and placental telomere lengths showed
skewed distribution and were log10 transformed to im-
prove normal distribution. To study potential confounding
structure in our dataset, we assessed the distributions of
continuous variables (ANOVA) and proportions of cat-
egorical variables (χ2 test) across different classes of ma-
ternal
pre-pregnancy
BMI
(normal,
overweight,
and
obese). Pearson correlation (unadjusted analysis) and mul-
tiple linear regressions were applied to address the associ-
ation between maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and cord
blood or placental telomere lengths. In a first model, we
adjusted for maternal and paternal age, maternal educa-
tion, newborn gender, gestational age and birth weight. In
a second model, we additionally adjusted for parity, mater-
nal smoking status, newborn ethnicity, cesarean section,
and pregnancy complications. Finally, we introduced ma-
ternal net weight gain during pregnancy to our models as
a continuous variable as well as a categorical variable
coded as sufficient and insufficient weight gain using the
definition of Institute of Medicine guidelines (see Study
population and data collection). In order to test whether
the association of gestational weight gain on newborn
telomere length is influenced by maternal pre-pregnancy
BMI, we tested the interaction between weight gain and
pre-pregnancy BMI. We ran different sensitivity analyses
in which we separately excluded mothers from non-
European origin, those with pre-pregnancy BMI less than
18.5, those who underwent cesarean section, or those who
experienced complications during pregnancy.

 mean (SD) pre-pregnancy BMI was 24.1 (4.1) kg/m2. Of
the 743 mothers, 175 (23 %) were overweight and 80
(11 %) were obese. Most women (63 %, n = 465) never
smoked cigarettes and 178 women (24 %) stopped smok-
ing before pregnancy, whereas 100 mothers (13 %) re-
ported to have smoked during pregnancy (on average 8.6
cigarettes per day). The newborns, among them 376 girls
(51 %), had a mean gestational age of 39.2 weeks (range,
30–42) and comprised 417 (56 %) primiparous and 249
(34 %) secundiparous newborns. About 89 % (n = 658) of
the newborns were Europeans of Caucasian ethnicity.
The mean (SD) birth weight of the newborns was 3400
(475) g. Five minutes after delivery, more than 90 % of
the newborns had an Apgar score of 9 or 10. Higher ma-
ternal pre-pregnancy BMI was associated with more
cesarean sections (P for trend = 0.005), pregnancy com-
plications (P for trend = 0.006), and higher newborn
birth weight (P for trend = 0.0005). Obese mothers had
gained less weight during pregnancy compared to normal
weight and overweight mothers (P for trend < 0.0001).
The percentage of newborns from non-European origin
was somewhat higher in the highest versus lowest BMI
class (17 % vs. 10 %).
Predictors of newborn telomere length
The relative telomere length ranged from 0.51 to 1.75 in
cord blood and 0.52 to 1.89 in placental tissue. The cord
placental telomere length correlation was 0.44 (P < 0.0001)
(Additional file 1: Figure S2). Compared with newborn
boys, newborn girls had 6.83 % (95 % CI, 4.27–
9.30 %; P < 0.0001) longer telomere length in cord blood
and 5.24 % (95 % CI, 2.05–8.32 %; P = 0.002) longer
in placental tissue. Low maternal education was asso-
ciated with shorter cord blood telomeres (−6.04 %;
95 % CI, −10.18 to −1.71 %; P = 0.007) when comparing to
the highest maternal education level. Cord blood and

 placental telomere length increased with 0.27 % (95 %
CI, −0.01 to 0.54 %; P = 0.06) and 0.25 % (95 % CI, −0.08
to 0.59 %; P = 0.14), respectively, for each year increase in
paternal age. No significant associations were found with
cord blood or placental telomeres and maternal age, ma-
ternal weight gain during pregnancy, gestational age, ma-
ternal smoking status, newborn ethnicity, pregnancy
complications, or delivery modus.
Association between pre-pregnancy BMI and newborn
telomere length
Compared to mothers with a normal weight, cord blood
and placental telomere length were lower in overweight
and obese women (Table 2). In continuous analysis, both
before (Fig. 1) and after mutual adjustment for different
sets of covariates and potential confounders, both cord
blood and placental telomere length (Table 3) were con-
sistently lower with higher pre-pregnancy BMI. For each
unit (1 kg/m2) increment in maternal pre-pregnancy
BMI, cord blood telomere length was 0.50 % shorter
(95 % CI, −0.83 to −0.17 %; P = 0.003) and placental telo-
mere length was 0.66 % shorter (95 % CI, −1.06 to −0.25 %;
P = 0.002). Mothers gained weight during pregnancy on
the average (14.3 ± 5.6 kg) but further cumulative adjust-
ment for maternal weight gain did not influence our results
(Table 4). We did not observe a weight gain during preg-
nancy by pre-pregnancy BMI interaction with newborn
cord (P = 0.85) or placental (P = 0.22) telomere length.
Categorical analysis showed no association of insufficient
and sufficient weight gain during pregnancy on newborn
telomere length (Table 4). Sensitivity analyses with exclu-
sion of newborns from non-European origin, mothers with
pre-pregnancy BMI less than 18.5, mothers that underwent
cesarean sections, or experienced pregnancy complications
did not materially alter our results (Table 5).
Discussion
Persons of the same age vary greatly with regards to
telomere length and this variation is present from early
life. The key finding of our paper is that pre-pregnancy
BMI is associated with shorter newborn cord blood and
placental telomeres. These associations remained un-
changed after adjustments for paternal and maternal age
at birth, maternal education, and newborn gender, birth
weight, and gestational age. Our findings shed light on
the pre-pregnancy effects of maternal BMI on the next
generation. Indeed, our data showed that, for each BMI
unit increase, average relative cord blood and placental
telomeres were 0.50 % and 0.66 % shorter, respectively.
The telomere loss in newborns of obese mothers may in-
crease the risk for chronic diseases in adulthood. As we
used a real-time PCR method we are not able to provide
absolute values of telomere lengths to estimate the ef-
fects of our decline based on absolute values as mea-
sured, for instance, using terminal restriction fragments.
Nevertheless, an estimation can be based on available

 data from mean umbilical cord blood telomere lengths
(measured using TRF), leading to an estimated value of
approximately 10 kb [20, 21, 52, 53], indicating a decrease
of 0.50 % leads to a loss of approximately 50 bp in cord
blood telomere length for each maternal BMI point in-
crease. Based on longitudinal studies, an annual loss be-
tween 32.2 and 45.5 bp is estimated in adult leukocytes
[54], indicating that each maternal pre-pregnancy BMI
point increase is equivalent to a loss of 1.1 to 1.6 telomeric
year equivalence in adulthood (based on telomere attrition
of 32.2–45.5 bp/year). This illustrates the public health
significance of our findings, as newborns from obese
mothers compared with newborns from normal weight
mothers were biologically approximately 12 to 17 years
older, based on telomeric year equivalence in adulthood.
Longitudinal studies have shown that telomere attri-
tion is greatest during early life. Experimental studies in
zebra finches show that telomere length in early life is
predictive of longevity [55]. Therefore, our results of ma-
ternal BMI on newborn telomere length comprise an
important public health finding.
Epidemiologic and animal studies indicate associations be-
tween pre-pregnancy maternal obesity and cardiovascular
diseases and metabolic disorders in the offspring [45, 46].
Maternal obesity during the first trimester of pregnancy has
been associated with a relative risk of childhood obesity of
2.3 (95 % CI, 2.0–2.6) at the age of 4 years [43]. A suggested
mechanism that could underlie these relationships is in
utero fetal programming by nutritional stimuli [38]. Fetuses
have to adapt to the supply of nutrients crossing the pla-
centa, which may permanently change their physiology and
metabolism.
Our findings in newborns support the association be-
tween BMI and telomere length in adulthood. Meta-
analytical evidence suggests that leukocyte telomere length
is inversely associated with BMI in adulthood [33]. In adult
women, Valdes et al. [56] reported on the average 240 bp
shorter telomeres in obese women BMI > 30 compared
with lean women which corresponds to a age difference of
8.8 years. The role of the enzyme telomerase in the associ-
ation between increased BMI and shortened telomeres is
less well understood. Epel et al. [57] described low telomer-
ase activity with increased BMI in 62 adult healthy women,
which may be an important factor for the observed short-
ened telomeres in relation with body weight. Whether al-
tered telomerase activity in mothers due to increased BMI
also indicates altered neonatal telomerase activity remains
unclear and might be an interesting topic of research.
Obesity increases systemic inflammation and generation of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) in fat cells [58–60]. These

 high levels of ROS resulting in higher oxidative stress might
explain accelerated shortening of telomeres in addition to
cellular replication [61, 62]. As telomeres contain G-rich
fragments that are highly sensitive to ROS, these higher
levels of oxidative stress can lead to breakage of DNA and a
more rapid decline in telomere length [63]. Higher mater-
nal oxidative stress and inflammation status due to in-
creased obesity might generate a higher inflammatory and
oxidative stress intrauterine environment for the developing
fetus, influencing telomere biology during the in utero life.
Recent studies indeed showed that maternal obesity leads
to increased oxidative stress in both mothers and new-
borns. Higher states of oxidative stress were observed in
maternal plasma as well as in newborn plasma and placen-
tal tissue of obese mothers compared with normal weight
mothers [64]. Increased levels of malondialdehyde, super-
oxide anion, and nitric oxide levels were observed in new-
borns of obese mothers [64, 65]. These higher levels of
oxidative stress have been proposed to induce metabolic al-
terations that may act as mechanisms in fetal programming
[66] and this may provide a link between maternal obesity
and shortened telomere lengths in newborns.
In the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort, we observed (in un-
adjusted analysis), besides an association with pre-pregnancy
BMI, longer cord blood and placental telomeres in female
newborns compared to male newborns, that telomeres
tended to be longer with increased paternal age, and that
cord blood telomeres were longer in association with higher
maternal education, all of which are in accordance to recent
studies [28, 29, 67]. A strength of our study is the large sam-
ple size of newborns with matching cord blood and placen-
tal tissue, to study telomere length associations. We found
consistent results of shorter telomere length in both new-
born cord blood and placenta in association with pre-
pregnancy BMI. Further, our findings are generalizable as
our study population is representative for the gestational
segment of the population at large (Additional file 1: Table
S1). Our associations remained unchanged after adjustments
for different covariates and potential cofounders and per-
sisted across subgroups or after excluding non-European
newborns, mothers with pre-pregnancy BMI less than
18.5 kg/m2, cesarean sections, and pregnancy complications,
further suggesting an independent association. We need to
address some limitations of this study. We do not have in-
formation on paternal BMI and recent epigenetic effects of
paternal weight on newborns have been described [68,
69]. We used a real-time PCR method to determine telo-
mere
lengths,

 variability compared to the traditionally used TRF method
[70, 71]. However, we participated in an inter-laboratory
comparison and achieved coefficients of variation of less
than 7 %. Further, we acknowledge the fact that variability
within the placenta exists, and for our study the intra-
placental variability for telomeres was 11 %. Recently,
Factor-Litvak et al. [67] showed a strong correlation be-
tween newborn telomere length measured in cord blood
and both age-adjusted paternal and maternal telomere
lengths. As overweight mothers may potentially have
shorter telomeres, the association between pre-preg-
nancy BMI and newborn telomere length might be medi-
ated by maternal telomere lengths. This mediation could
not be addressed in the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort at
this moment as no data on maternal telomere lengths was
available. Finally, we need to acknowledge that other po-
tential important factors that occur during pregnancy,
such as newborn telomerase activity and alteration of oxi-
dative stress-related markers in mothers and newborns,
and which might influence telomere length at birth, were
not measured.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is the first study to report a strong
association between maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and telo-
mere lengths in newborns in a large birth cohort. Telomere
length in early life predicts life span; therefore, our results
on variation in offspring early-life telomere length in associ-
ation with maternal BMI are a major step forward in unrav-
elling the early life determinants of telomere length.
Further, the public health impact is considerable, as in afflu-
ent societies approximately 30 % of women of reproductive
age are overweight. Our results add to the growing body of
evidence that high maternal BMI impacts fetal program-
ming. Maintaining a normal BMI during a women’s repro-
ductive age may promote molecular longevity in the
offspring as exemplified by newborn telomere length. In
this context, maternal overweight and obesity might be one
of the most preventable environmental factors that may in-
crease life expectations of newborns and may impact over-
all quality of life by decreasing comorbidities in adulthood.
