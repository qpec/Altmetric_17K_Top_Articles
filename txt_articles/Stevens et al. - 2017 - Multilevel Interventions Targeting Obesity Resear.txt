Abstract
Introduction—The origins of obesity are complex and multifaceted. To be successful, an 
intervention aiming to prevent or treat obesity may need to address multiple layers of biological, 
social, and environmental influences.
Methods—NIH recognizes the importance of identifying effective strategies to combat obesity, 
particularly in high-risk and disadvantaged populations with heightened susceptibility to obesity 
and subsequent metabolic sequelae. To move this work forward, the National Heart, Lung, and 
Blood Institute, in collaboration with the NIH Office of Behavioral and Social Science Research 
and NIH Office of Disease Prevention convened a working group to inform research on multilevel 
obesity interventions in vulnerable populations. The working group reviewed relevant aspects of 
intervention planning, recruitment, retention, implementation, evaluation, and analysis, and then 
made recommendations.
Results—Recruitment and retention techniques used in multilevel research must be culturally 
appropriate and suited to both individuals and organizations. Adequate time and resources for 
preliminary work are essential. Collaborative projects can benefit from complementary areas of

 expertise and shared investigations rigorously pretesting specific aspects of approaches. Study 
designs need to accommodate the social and environmental levels under study, and include 
appropriate attention given to statistical power. Projects should monitor implementation in the 
multiple venues and include a priori estimation of the magnitude of change expected within and 
across levels.
Conclusions—The complexity and challenges of delivering interventions at several levels of the 
social—ecologic model require careful planning and implementation, but hold promise for 
successful reduction of obesity in vulnerable populations.
INTRODUCTION
Obesity is a major threat to public health because it increases risk for several chronic 
diseases, including cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of death in the U.S. 
Obesity and its adverse effects on health occur disproportionately among ethnic minorities 
and those with low SES, individuals living in rural areas, and some immigrant 
populations.1–3 High-risk and vulnerable populations require intensification of efforts to 
reduce obesity to maintain a healthy public.
The importance of research to identify strategies to combat chronic conditions, including 
obesity in high-risk groups, has long been recognized by NIH. In 2010, in response to a 
strategic priority at NIH, the National Cancer Institute collaborated with the National Heart, 
Lung, and Blood Institute to support the Centers for Population Health and Health 
Disparities Program to better address inequities in health among underserved racial, ethnic, 
and poor populations, with a focus on utilizing and evaluating multilevel interventions.4 
Recommendations from that program highlighted the need to address underlying social and 
economic barriers to healthy choices and collaboration with local health delivery systems 
and safety net providers to improve healthcare access and quality for underserved 
populations. Also endorsed was use of community-based participatory research principles to 
improve population health outcomes, and transdisciplinary collaborations. 5–7
Building upon these efforts, on September 15–16, 2015, the National Heart, Lung, and 
Blood Institute, in collaboration with the NIH Office of Disease Prevention and the NIH 
Office of Behavioral and Social Science Research, convened a working group to inform 
future research directions for multilevel interventions in high-risk and vulnerable 
populations, to encourage and enrich public health action. The group was composed of 
pediatricians, family medicine and community health educators, nurses, epidemiologists, 
biostatisticians, behavioral scientists, psychologists, and project coordinators who are 
experts in obesity, health promotion, behavior change, multilevel and systems intervention 
research design, nutrition, and physical activity. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss 
critical issues in the design and implementation of multilevel intervention research targeting 
hard-to-reach, high-risk, or vulnerable populations and communities.
This report summarizes the presentations and recommendations made at the meeting and 
additional discussions that were initiated by those interactions. It is intended to be of use to 
researchers, funders, and policymakers as they consider future research on the control of 
obesity in vulnerable populations. It begins by expanding on the meaning and contributions

 to be made by multilevel interventions, with particular attention to vulnerable populations. It 
then reviews relevant aspects formative work, intervention planning, recruitment, retention, 
implementation, evaluation, and analysis. It also gives suggestions for future research.
MULTILEVEL INTERVENTIONS
Multiple factors influence obesity risk, including individual behavioral factors, social and 
physical environments, and state and local policies. Multilevel interventions include change 
strategies in two or more levels of influence in the social—ecologic model (Figure 1).8–10 
Interventions with multiple components that address only one level of influence, such as 
programs that modify aspects of both the food and physical activity environments in schools, 
are multicomponent, but not multilevel. Multilevel interventions are delivered in more than 
one setting and researchers are usually (but not always) required to intervene on different 
people or sets of people in each setting to affect change.
In the ongoing Childhood Obesity Prevention and Treatment Consortium, four studies are 
testing the use of multilevel interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity in 
high-risk, vulnerable populations.10 For example, the Stanford GOALS study is an RCT that 
intervenes on overweight and obese children of Hispanic descent at three levels.11 The 
intervention includes a sports program delivered in community centers, environmental and 
behavioral changes in the home, and enhanced behavioral counseling delivered by primary 
care practitioners in their offices.
HIGH-RISK, VULNERABLE POPULATIONS
In spite of efforts from multiple stakeholders in recent decades, the high prevalence of 
obesity in the U.S. has shown little improvement.3,12,13 Population segments of deep 
concern include children, low-income individuals, racial/ethnic minority groups, rural 
populations, and adults aged >65 years.3,12–15 Predisposing factors for excess weight 
include biological, behavioral, cultural, environmental, political, sociodemographic (income, 
gender, race/ethnicity, age), and life stage.1,16–23 There is a need to better understand the 
multitude of complex and context-specific factors that interact to enhance vulnerability.24
A group recently recognized as being at high risk for developing obesity is recent 
immigrants, and studies indicate that dietary quality and physical activity patterns often 
decline soon after entry into the U.S.1,2 Reasons for this decline may be environmental, such 
as places where immigrants settle (poor, urban food desert, high convenience food, high 
crime communities), which then predispose individuals to developing poor dietary habits 
and physical inactivity.20,21,23 Furthermore, immigrant and low-income status each amplify 
barriers such as language constraints, limited access to resources, and health beliefs, which 
may contribute to behaviors that lead to obesity. These sources of vulnerability make recent 
immigrants an important group to consider for new research.
FORMATIVE WORK
Understanding the determinants of health behaviors in the specific population of interest is 
crucial to the design of feasible, acceptable, and effective interventions. Ideally formative

 research would be conducted at multiple levels of influence in preparation for intervention 
planning, and be used to identify which determinants are: most strongly related to obesity 
risk in the population of interest; most susceptible to change; and mutable within the scope 
of the intervention, considering length of time, cost, and expertise, and other resources 
needed to conduct the intervention.25,26 Formative work can be both qualitative and 
quantitative and use existing as well as newly collected data. Examples of formative work in 
obesity multilevel intervention trials include collaboration with community advisory groups 
and conducting small, iterative pilot studies to refine interventions aimed at community, 
individual, and family levels.11,27,28
Recommendations
•
Designate adequate time to conduct and analyze both qualitative and quantitative 
formative assessment at multiple levels to understand contextual factors relevant 
to the population under study.
•
Engage and obtain the perspectives of members of the target population and a 
wide variety of stakeholders early in the process.
•
Use multidisciplinary approaches to examine influences at multiple levels.
•
Continue to collect formative data as the intervention is being developed and 
implemented to understand issues related to dissemination.
PRELIMINARY WORK AND INTERVENTION PLANNING
Current conceptual models suggest the role of complex systems in obesity etiologies, 
prevention, and control.29 Thus, the addition of systems thinking to multilevel intervention 
design may help to increase impact.30,31 Systems models are distinguished from multilevel 
models by including, for example, dynamic interactions between and across levels and 
components, feedback loops and tipping points that may magnify or attenuate responses, and 
consideration of non-linear changes and multiple causal pathways. Interventions can be 
designed to incorporate these same complex systems features to prompt interactions and 
synergies between multiple components across multiple levels and settings.29 Similarly, 
careful consideration of specific behavior change strategies planned for the intervention may 
increase its effectiveness.32,33
Perry’s planning model34 and Intervention Mapping35 are examples of guides that can be 
useful in intervention design. Such approaches could be used to produce a specific, 
standardized, but flexible multilevel intervention guide for obesity prevention in vulnerable 
populations. A standard intervention planning process could be applied to determinants and 
the levels of influence relevant to a specific group. Thus, different interventions could be 
developed to reflect the determinants and capacities of the specific targeted population, but 
the process would be generalizable and reproducible.
A consortium of investigators could conduct preliminary or evidentiary studies36 that 
emanate from a defined, but flexible, intervention planning process. Sharing of results could 
accelerate the process of finalizing the specific intervention strategies to be used. Within that

 work, triggers and tailored therapies could be defined for use as elements of adaptive 
interventions using the Multiphasic Optimization Strategy framework, including designs 
such as a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART).37–39 The magnitude of 
change expected within levels and in the ultimate target (usually at the individual level) 
should be estimated a priori so that expectations and goals are well communicated and 
realistic.
Recommendations
•
Include intervention strategies that target determinants at multiple levels of the 
ecologic model.
•
Create linkages among the intervention levels and optimize the likelihood of 
synergy.
•
Consider the use of triggers to adapt or tailor interventions at multiple levels.
•
Incorporate systems thinking into the design and evaluation of multilevel 
interventions to try to anticipate, capture, and better understand the complexity 
of interacting exposures and responses.
•
Consider a priori decomposition of intervention strategies using a taxonomy such 
as that proposed by Michie et al.33,40 to describe and evaluate the anticipated 
approach.
•
Conduct appropriately powered evidentiary studies that target modest (relatively 
easily influenced) outcomes at several levels prior to undertaking the full trial to 
help select effective approaches.
RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION
For multilevel interventions, it is helpful to contact individuals in leadership positions within 
targeted organizations. Community groups (e.g., parks and recreation), healthcare systems 
(clinics, hospitals), and educational establishments (e.g., Head Start, schools) provide 
natural partners in these types of efforts. Recruitment of these organizations may require 
unique strategies and incentives, and often their early involvement in the planning processes 
is important.
To reach largely underserved populations, recruitment efforts need to consider locations 
where these populations tend to be, processes that allow for a trusted introduction to the 
recruiter and the research study, and materials in preferred language with attention to health 
literacy.41 In a systematic review of recruitment of underserved populations into research, 
social marketing and referral recruitment were found to be most successful.42 A potentially 
cost-effective recruitment strategy also includes recruiting from within ongoing cohort 
studies. Often, trust has already been established between the researchers and participants, 
and substudies can be effectively launched through this approach.43
Retention of both participants and organizations is critical to successful multilevel research. 
Retention efforts that maximize the building of trusting relationships with research staff can 
be particularly effective. Some studies have applied a “case management” approach, 
Stevens et al.

 allowing for consistent bidirectional communication between participants and a research-
staff point person.41,44 Frequent updating of contact information is critical, given that many 
participants change phone carriers and addresses throughout the course of the study, and 
organizations experience changes in personnel.
Recommendations
•
Define the population to be studied to facilitate the ability to focus on culturally 
important issues.
•
Cultivate relationships with key individuals and organizations at every 
intervention level and involve them in the planning process when possible.
•
Develop metrics for the study team to review on a regular basis, assessing 
objective progress and identifying what is working and what is not, in real time.
•
Plan ahead to maintain contact with study participants.
INTERVENTION IMPLEMENTATION
Because multilevel interventions often include a focus on the social and physical 
environments, it is useful to engage community members in intervention development and 
implementation. One resource that can be tapped for this service is the community health 
worker (CHW). CHW is an umbrella term describing community members who assist 
individuals and communities to adopt healthy behaviors. They usually share ethnicity, 
language, SES, and life experiences with the community members they serve. They have 
training that is recognized by health services and in some states require certification. 
Researchers should triage and amplify training for CHWs who show aptitude for work with 
community organizations to increase advocacy for the mobilization of resources and to work 
with policy-makers as community representatives. A review by the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention Task Force on Community Preventive Services has demonstrated 
sufficient evidence of effectiveness for CHWs to improve outcomes for blood pressure, 
cholesterol, physical activity, and healthful eating habits in patients at increased risk for 
cardiovascular disease.45
Process evaluation at all levels of the intervention is essential to try to understand how 
implementation of the intervention may be related to its effectiveness, acceptability, and 
dissemination potential.46–50 Equally important is the need to track intervention adherence, 
dose (delivered and received), and fidelity.46,51–53 For intervention trials that are being 
conducted by multiple investigative teams (such as in a multicenter trial), the ability to 
identify common process measures allows intervention implementation to be examined both 
within and across trials, thereby increasing the richness of the data.25,54
To enhance intervention effectiveness, baseline and interim measures can be collected and 
used as triggers for adaptations throughout the study conduct.37,55 Triggers and adaptations 
can be instituted at one or more levels of influence, or across levels of influence. 
Administered correctly, preplanned alterations in the intervention can amplify effectiveness 
without violating study blinding, even when the trigger is the primary outcome

 variable. 55,56 In addition, these preplanned changes do not inhibit the potential to 
disseminate an intervention, as do ad hoc, unplanned changes that are often poorly 
described, difficult to emulate, and constructed such that they may only be potent in the 
specific sample under study.
Recommendations
•
Plan for adequate resources to maintain intervention delivery at each level.
•
Consider using CHWs to engage community members and plan to provide 
training to enhance their role in outreach, enrollment, and intervention.
•
Track intervention participation and fidelity across settings using prespecified 
criteria for success, including minimal dose (delivered and received) at each 
level.
•
Monitor response to interventions at multiple levels and prespecify criteria for 
adapting the interventions to improve overall intervention effectiveness.
EVALUATION
For an obesity-related intervention, the primary evaluation of effect is usually at the 
individual level. However, careful thought should be given to assessment of the intervention 
at multiple levels. Investigators may want to use a composite variable to evaluate specific or 
multiple components of the intervention, as it can give insight into the achievement of a set 
of goals, rather than examining goals one by one. Although a global evaluation has value, 
composite variables can result in loss of information and be difficult to interpret.57,58 
Investigators need to balance these factors and be careful to insure proper interpretation.
Recommendations
•
Collect key process and outcome data to evaluate the implementation and 
effectiveness of each level of the intervention.
•
Consider the use of composite variables.
STUDY DESIGN AND ANALYSIS
Multilevel interventions pose special challenges for design and analysis because they 
address multiple levels of influence (Figure 1). Individuals may be independent at one level 
but have some connection with each other or with a common change agent at another level. 
This is obvious in trials that randomize groups or clusters,59–62 but it also occurs in trials 
that randomize individual participants but deliver interventions to real or virtual 
groups.60,63–69 Such connections create the expectation for positive intraclass correlation 
among observations taken on participants in the same group or cluster.70 It will be difficult 
to avoid this problem, as investigators would have to avoid any connection among 
participants across the hierarchy of levels for the duration of the trial.
Positive intraclass correlation will invalidate the usual analytic procedures.59–62,71 In 
addition, if the number of groups or clusters is limited, the df available for the test of the

 intervention effect will also be limited,71 which in turn will limit the power for that 
test.59,60,71 Finally, simple randomization of a limited number of groups or clusters to study 
conditions may not be enough to evenly distribute all potential sources of confounding,59,60 
so special attention must be given to control confounding in the analysis. The available 
design and analytic options vary substantially in the way that they address these issues.
Recommended designs have some form of randomization or complete modeling of the 
assignment rule to protect against confounding. Examples of the former include group- or 
cluster-randomized trials (random assignment of identifiable groups to study conditions with 
observations on group members),59–62 individually randomized group treatment trials 
(random assignment of individuals to study conditions with delivery of some intervention 
components in small groups or through a common change agent),60,63–69 stepped wedge 
designs (sequential randomization of all groups to intervention, providing both intervention 
and comparison observations on all groups),72–76 and RCTs (randomization of individuals 
with no interaction with each other or with a common change agent post-randomization).77 
The recommended non-randomized design relies on complete modeling of the assignment 
rule (regression discontinuity designs: those scoring on one side of a quantitative cut point 
receive the treatment, whereas those on the other side are controls, with proper modeling of 
the relationship between the assignment score and the outcome in the analysis).78–88 
Designs that do not have either of these features do not provide the same strength of 
evidence for causal inference.79,89–91 Even so, if none of the recommended designs can be 
used, multiple baseline designs (sequential assignment of a small number of groups to 
treatment, providing both intervention and comparison observations on all groups),90,92 
quasi-experimental designs (all the features of RCTs except randomization), 79,91 and time 
series designs (many observations before and after introduction of the intervention with 
analysis of change associated with the intervention) 79,91,93 may be helpful. SMART designs 
(randomization to dose or type of intervention component based on response to prior 
intervention)38,94–97 have been suggested as a way to refine interventions in preparation for 
a larger, standard randomized trial. SMART designs are well suited to assist researchers in 
the determination of triggers and intervention alternatives for use in a planned adaptive 
intervention.94
There are many examples of RCTs,98 group- or cluster-randomized trials,99 and individually 
randomized group treatment trials10 to evaluate obesity interventions. The authors identified 
one example of a stepped wedge design,100 three examples of SMART designs,37,101,102 and 
three examples of regression discontinuity designs103–105 applied to evaluate an obesity 
intervention. As such, it is clear that all of the recommended designs have applications in 
obesity intervention research. A recently introduced adaptation of the SMART design, the 
SMART with adaptive randomization design (adapts randomization probabilities to favor 
intervention sequences that appear to be superior)106 may find future use in obesity 
interventions but, to the authors’ knowledge, has not yet been applied.
Recommendations
•
If connections among participants or with a common change agent are expected, 
employ group- or cluster-randomized trials, individually randomized group

 treatment trials, stepped wedge designs, or regression discontinuity designs that 
allocate groups or clusters to study conditions. If not, employ traditional RCTs.
•
Consider SMART or SMART with adaptive randomization designs if treatment 
response heterogeneity is expected.
•
Consider factorial and repeated-measures designs in the context of group- or 
cluster-randomized trials and RCTs to increase the information provided by, or 
the efficiency of, the trial.
•
Reflect the design in the analytic plan. There are a number of approaches that 
can provide a valid analysis, including mixed-model regression methods, 
randomization tests, fixed-effects modeling in two stages, and analyses based on 
generalized estimating equations, often with a small sample correction.63,107,108
•
Estimate expected effect sizes and power conservatively, using clinical trials data
—based estimates of variance and intraclass correlation.
•
Consider tests of interactions, both within and between levels, at least as 
secondary analyses, even if power for those tests is limited.
•
Report results separately by gender and by race/ethnicity, even if there is limited 
power for such interaction effects, to support subsequent meta-analyses.
CONCLUSIONS
Although multilevel interventions have the potential to reduce obesity in vulnerable 
populations, they can be challenging, given the number and complexity of levels of influence 
requiring distinct interventions. Collaborative projects involving a group of investigators can 
benefit from an array of expertise pertinent to specific settings, as well as from larger sample 
size. Also, a consortium of studies can promote sharing of preliminary testing of 
intervention components applied in different settings. This type of testing is crucial, but 
often abbreviated by resources and circumstance. Acquired experiences could be used to 
inform a fully elaborated intervention in the format of a planning process that contains 
specific features and behavior change therapies, but is flexible to accommodate nuances of 
study settings and populations. The planning process used to construct different 
interventions tested at different sites would be amenable to dissemination owing to its 
flexibility.
Finally, a consortium, with common measurements enhanced and standardized by a 
coordinating center, can provide strong opportunities for samples studied in a randomized 
trial to be efficiently converted into a longitudinal cohort, thus leveraging value. Ideally, the 
plans for this conversion would be detailed prior to the collection of baseline trial data so 
that key variables can be included for longitudinal study. The questions to be addressed do 
not need to be limited to those expected to be impacted by the intervention, but could 
encompass a larger range of issues pertinent to the health of the population and 
organizations under study.
