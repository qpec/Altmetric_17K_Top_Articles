ABSTRACT: Novel pyrazolopyrimidines displaying high
potency and selectivity toward SRC family kinases have been
developed by combining ligand-based design and phenotypic
screening in an iterative manner. Compounds were derived
from the promiscuous kinase inhibitor PP1 to search for
analogs that could potentially target a broad spectrum of
kinases involved in cancer. Phenotypic screening against
MCF7 mammary adenocarcinoma cells generated target-
agnostic structure−activity relationships that biased subse-
quent designs toward breast cancer treatment rather than to a
particular target. This strategy led to the discovery of two
potent antiproliferative leads with phenotypically distinct
anticancer mode of actions. Kinase profiling and further optimization resulted in eCF506, the first small molecule with
subnanomolar IC50 for SRC that requires 3 orders of magnitude greater concentration to inhibit ABL. eCF506 exhibits excellent
water solubility, an optimal DMPK profile and oral bioavailability, halts SRC-associated neuromast migration in zebrafish
embryos without inducing life-threatening heart defects, and inhibits SRC phosphorylation in tumor xenografts in mice.
■ INTRODUCTION
Modern drug discovery programs typically begin with a
screening campaign (e.g., biochemical, virtual, or biophysical)
for agonists, antagonists, or inhibitors of a nominated target
associated with a particular disease.1−4 After hit identification,
subsequent chemical optimization is fundamentally based upon
“on-target” potency.1 The generation of high-affinity ligands
(so-called lead compounds) is followed by chemical refinement
into derivatives of superior potency, selectivity, and desirable
pharmacokinetic properties.1,5 Selected drug candidates are
then validated in vivo and, upon verification of safety and
efficacy, progressed to human trials.5 While the merits of this
well-defined process are undeniable, including several major
breakthroughs in anticancer therapy,6 this strategy is also
associated with declining productivity in the pharmaceutical
industry and limited success to tackle the most aggressive
cancers of unmet therapeutic need.7,8 High attrition rates at late
stages of drug development underlines that cancer hetero-
geneity across patients and adaptive drug resistance mecha-
nisms are major obstacles for the development of effective and
long-lasting anticancer targeted therapies.9−12 These challenges
have stimulated out-of-the-box thinking in pharmacotherapy
research (e.g., targeted polypharmacology,10 antibody-drug
conjugates,13 innovative prodrug approaches,14−17 etc.) and
the re-examination of the core principles of drug discovery in
complex diseases.18−20 The rise of modern phenotypic drug
discovery18,19 together with the use of more clinically relevant
disease models to guide early drug development20 are
representative examples of the paradigm shift initiated in the
field to trigger a positive inflection point.

 Protein kinases are integral components of signal trans-
duction cascades. They govern a wide range of basic
intracellular functions and coordinate cell-to-cell and extrac-
ellular matrix-to-cell communication to modulate cell and tissue
physiology. Consequently, their malfunctioning is directly
linked to progressive diseases including cancer and inflamma-
tion.21 The success in the clinic of several anticancer kinase
inhibitors has validated a number of kinases as oncotargets,22
while the increasing understanding of cancer cell biology has
demonstrated the essential role of different kinases in tumor
suppressor pathways (antitargets).23−26
The vast majority of kinase inhibitors bind to the kinase
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) pocket. Since all kinases (>500)
necessarily possess this relatively well-conserved catalytic site,
there is a great potential for cross-reactivity.10 In fact, even
though most kinase inhibitors are developed from single target
hypotheses, they typically display broad selectivity profiles
which, in some cases, have resulted in unanticipated clinical
applications (e.g., sorafenib).26 Inhibitor promiscuity may also
be advantageous for anticancer therapy when off-target
activities assist to address bioactivity issues related to pathway
redundancies, molecular heterogeneity, or resistance mecha-
nisms.9,10,26 However, if these activities result in the inhibition
of antioncogenic pathways or lead to severe side effects, drug
promiscuity becomes a major drawback.27,28 Paradoxically,
some kinases may behave as a target or an antitarget depending
on the cancer context. The expression of the activated fusion
oncoprotein BCR-ABL is a genetic abnormality associated with
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and ABL inhibitors
(imatinib, dasatinib) are clinically used in chronic phase CML
treatment.29 Also, ABL family kinases are abnormally activated
in various solid tumors, supporting their involvement in
oncogenesis.29 However, ABL (ABL1) and ARG (ABL2)
have been found to negatively modulate breast cancer
progression in vivo,30−32 indicating that ABL inhibition could
be counterproductive for breast cancer treatment (= antitarget).
This example serves to delineate the complexity of cancer
etiology and highlights the necessity of developing kinase
inhibitors with tailor-made pharmacodynamic profiles for the
effective targeting of each cancer subtype.33 Unfortunately,
despite significant investments in the development of kinase
inhibitors and the biomedical knowledge compiled over several
decades, our still limited understanding of cancer biology
prevents us from anticipating and optimally targeting the
complex orchestrated actions that generate, maintain, and
progress most neoplastic processes.
Acknowledging these limitations, many research groups
including ours are frontloading the collection of robust
empirical data to progress anticancer drug development
programs away from classical black-and-white anticancer target
hypotheses to more unbiased and evidence-led strategies for hit
selection and lead generation. Following that principle, in this
manuscript we show that cooperative ligand-based design and
phenotypic screening, complemented with biochemical assays
and the use of published data (literature, patents, etc.), can be
effectively applied to accelerate the generation of preclinical
drug candidates. Our strategy builds on three wide-ranging
hypotheses: (i) targeting the kinase ATP pocket with
compounds derived from promiscuous kinase inhibitors can
enable “rationally-biased” serendipitous discoveries; (ii) early
optimization of drug-likeness can be concurrently applied to
explore pharmacodynamic diversity; and (iii) phenotypic
screening of chemically related compounds in designated
models of cancer can generate target-agnostic structure−
bioactivity relationships and tailor ligand optimization to
particular cancer types/subtypes. By means of this pragmatic
approach to anticancer kinase inhibitor discovery, target
deconvolution of identified hits and leads is largely simplified,
thereby assisting the mechanistic elucidation of the molecular
targets and antitargets involved in the observed phenotype.
In this work we describe how the implementation of such an
approach led to the discovery of a kinase inhibitor with potent
activity against breast cancer cells and a unique selectivity
profile: the first small molecule able to inhibit SRC at
subnanomolar levels with a 1000-fold selectivity over ABL.
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Design, Synthesis, and Screening of Compounds 7a−
l. PP1 is a promiscuous inhibitor that indiscriminately targets
protein tyrosine kinases, many of which are involved in
oncogenesis such as the SRC family kinases (SFK), RET, KIT,
and ABL.34−37 Moreover, related derivatives developed there-
after38−40 have shown strong inhibition of a variety of kinases
with relevance in cancer including IGF-1R, EGFR, BTK,
VEGFR, PDGFR, PI3K, and mTOR. According to the co-
crystal structure of PP1 with HCK41 and RET42 kinases, this
small molecule is an archetypical type I kinase inhibitor, with its
N5 and 4-NH2 groups forming multiple H-bonds with the
hinge region of the kinase ATP site (Figure 1). The C3 p-tolyl
group is positioned toward a hydrophobic region well-
conserved across tyrosine kinases, thus being responsible for
the partial selectivity of PP1 over other kinase families.
Although PP1’s potent inhibition of disease-associated kinases
make it a valuable biological tool, its use is limited by low
solubility in water and poor selectivity, major limiting factors
for the clinical translation of many drug candidates.
We envisaged that the substitution of PP1’s tert-butyl group
at the N1 position with flexible water-solubilizing groups could
be used to improve drug-like properties and, at the same time,
explore the accessible sugar/phosphate regions occupied by the
natural ligand ATP in the search for novel binding affinity
profiles. As shown in Figure 1, compounds were designed to
display a cyclic tertiary amine connected to the N1 position of
Figure 1. Upper panel: ATP and PP1 (neutral forms). Lower panel:

 the pyrazolopyrimidine ring through an ethylene linker.
Following the route described in Scheme 1 (see full details in
the Supporting Information), a highly focused 12-member
library was generated by coupling a selection of cyclic
secondary amines to an aldehyde-modified derivative43 of
PP1 (6) via reductive amination.
The 12-member library was then tested against human
mammary adenocarcinoma MCF7 cells, using the inhibition of
cell growth as the primary output of the screening. Live-cell
high-content image-based phenotypic assays were carried out to
kinetically profile the antiproliferative response of MCF7 breast
cancer cells following treatment with a single dose (100 μM) of
compounds 7a−l for 5 d. Experiments were performed in
triplicate, using cells treated with PP1 (100 μM) or DMSO as a
positive and negative control, respectively. Cell proliferation
was monitored by time-lapse imaging using an IncuCyte
ZOOM microscope and analyzed by its software, enabling
determination of cell density (% confluence) over time after
compound addition. As shown in Figure 2a, compounds 7d and
7i−l (colored lines) led to a strong inhibition of cell
proliferation, maintaining confluence levels equal or below
those imaged at time zero (point of compound addition).
Interestingly, all these hits presented at least two tertiary amines
in their N1 motifs, providing the first insights into structure/
antiproliferative activity relationships.
Half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values were
then calculated for the five hits and PP1 in MCF7 cells using an
8-point half-log dose−response study (0.03 to 100 μM). Based
on the MCF7 growth kinetics data provided by the IncuCyte
assay, cell viability was determined at day 5 using the
PrestoBlue reagent. Figure 2b shows that derivatives 7j and
7k were the most potent among the novel compounds, with
EC50 values of 12 μM. Due to its potency and lower molecular
weight, the dimethylamino-containing piperidinyl group of
compound 7j was chosen as the N1 motif for the preparation of
a second library of pyrazolopyrimidines.
Design, Synthesis, and Screening of Compounds 8a−f
and 9a−f. Several investigations have reported that sub-
stitutions of the p-tolyl group at the C3 position of PP1 by
different aryl moieties (even closely related ones) have a major
impact on protein−ligand binding. Medicinal chemistry at that
position has generated inhibitors for a variety of kinases,
including receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., SRC,
ABL, RET, EGFR, BTK, PDGFRs, VEGFRs, KIT)34−38,40 and
nontyrosine kinases (e.g., PI3Ks, mTOR).39,44 To exploit this
feature as an opportunity to expand the prospective
pharmacodynamic scope of 7j, a selection of five arylboronic
acids and phenylacetylene were employed to functionalize the
C3 position of the heterocyclic ring by palladium-catalyzed
cross-coupling chemistry to synthesize derivatives 9a−f

 (Scheme 2). Together with the piperidine-containing com-
pounds 9a−f, the corresponding acetal intermediates 8a−f
were selected for testing against breast cancer cells to increase
the chemical diversity of the screening.
Antiproliferative properties of compounds 8a−f and 9a−f
were evaluated in MCF7 cells (dose−response studies), using
compound 5 (acetal intermediate of library 1), 7j (most potent
derivative of library 1), and PP1 as controls. As shown in Figure
3, compounds 8d and 9d (both having a 7-azaindol-5-yl group
at C3) exhibited superior antiproliferative properties (EC50 < 2
μM). Remarkably, time-lapse imaging of compounds 8d and 9d
(1−100 μM) revealed patently distinct antiproliferative mode
of actions (Figure 3b and Movies S1 and S2). Compound 9d
containing the piperidinyl moiety of 7jinduced cell death,
while its acetal precursor 8d halted cell division.
To identify the target/s that could be responsible of the
phenotype induced by hits 8d and 9d in MCF7 cells and
thereby shed some light over further optimization campaigns,
inhibition activities were tested for PP1, 7i−k, 8d, and 9d
against a selection of kinases involved in human cancer.
Proteins were chosen in accordance with the profile of related
pyrazolopyrimidines.34−39 Kinase profiling (Reaction Biology
Corp., USA) was performed by measuring 33P incorporation on
the substrate (poly [Glu, Tyr] 4:1) relative to DMSO. Dose−
response curves and calculated half-maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50) values are shown in Figure S1 and
Table 1, respectively. Derivatives 7i−k and 9d strongly
inhibited SFK members, whereas acetal-functionalized com-
pound 8d preferentially inhibited mTOR (>28-fold more
potent than PP1). The most potent inhibitor was compound
9d, which displayed similar potency to PP1 against SRC but
higher selectivity over RET, PDGFRα, and KIT. Interestingly,
according to the inhibition profile of compounds 7i−k (only
varying on the spacer between the dimethylamino group and
the piperidine), potency and selectivity for SRC were enhanced
by the proximity of the dimethylamino to the ring (IC50(ABL)/
IC50(SRC) for 7i = 50).
Using the information provided by the phenotypic screening
and the kinase inhibition profiling of leads 8d and 9d, two
independent optimization campaigns were implemented
toward the generation of anticancer drug candidates inhibiting
mTOR and SFK, respectively. Optimization of lead 8d into the
highly selective mTOR inhibitor eCF309 has been reported
elsewhere.45 Herein is described the generation and structure−
activity relationships (SAR) of pyrazolopyrimidine derivatives
with high potency and selectivity for SFK.
Design, Synthesis, and Phenotypic Screening of
Compounds 11a,b. The data collected from the kinase
profiling study indicated that the 2-[4-(dimethylamino)-1-
piperidyl]ethyl group at the N1 position was optimal to
generate SFK inhibitors of high selectivity, while the superior
potency of 9d against SRC suggested that on-target potency
could be further enhanced by optimization of the substituent at
the C3 position. A literature survey on SRC inhibitors was thus
performed to assist in the design of derivatives with improved
SRC binding. We focused our attention on the C3 substituent
of PP20, a potent dual SRC/ABL inhibitor developed by Apsel
et al. (Figure 4a).36 Novel derivatives were designed by
substituting the 7-azaindol-5-yl group at C3 of 9d with the
functionalized phenyl ring found in PP20, whereas the
piperidines used for 7i and 7j were introduced at the N1

 position. Acetal deprotection of compound 4 in TFA/water
(1:1) followed by reductive amination with either 4-
(dimethylamino) or 4-(dimethylaminomethyl)piperidine gen-
erated iodo intermediates 10a,b, respectively, which afforded
derivatives 11a (also known as eCF506) and 11b (Figure 4a)
by Suzuki cross-coupling with 4-(N-Boc-amino)-3-methoxy-
phenylboronic acid (see synthesis in the Supporting Informa-
tion).
Antiproliferative properties of compounds 11a,b were then
tested in cells using PP20 and dasatinib (a clinically approved
dual SRC/ABL inhibitor)22 as positive controls. Along with
MCF7 cells, breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells were
tested as a model of triple-negative breast cancer known to be
particularly sensitive to SRC inhibitors.46 As shown in Figure
4b, compound 11a induced a very potent antiproliferative effect
in both MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, significantly superior to
the activity displayed by derivatives 9d, 11b, and PP20.
Notably, 11a also outperformed the gold-standard SRC
inhibitor dasatinib.
Compound 11a was then selected for further screening.
Inhibition of SRC kinase activity in cells was studied by
Western blot. Upon activation, SRC undergoes autophosphor-
ylation of the Y416 residue within its kinase domain.47 Study of
phospho-SRCY416 levels can then serve both as evidence for the
presence of active SRC and to evaluate direct inhibition of SRC
kinase activity. Phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase
(FAK), a downstream substrate of SRC with high relevance in
cancer progression,48 was also studied in both MDA-MB-231
(Figure 4c) and MCF7 (Figure S2) cells. Dasatinib was used as
a positive control. Cell lysates were prepared following 24 h of
serum starvation and 1.5 h exposure to each inhibitor and
serum stimulation for 1 h. Analyses demonstrated that 11a
inhibits phosphorylation of SRC and FAK at low nanomolar
levels, with complete inhibition observed at 100 nM. Dasatinib

 activity was close to that of 11a, although it also induced a
dose-dependent increment of total SRC (Figure 4c).
Having demonstrated that 11a targets SRC in cells, we
investigated FAK activity and cell viability in cells that lack
expression of SRC. SYF murine embryonic fibroblasts (SRC−/
−, YES−/−, FYN−/−) were treated with either 11a or
dasatinib and levels of total/phospho-FAK analyzed by protein
immunoblot. As expected (Figure S3), FAK activity was found
to be unaffected by drug treatments, indicating that the
inhibition of phospho-FAKY861 in the breast cancer cell lines
was a consequence of SRC inhibition. Compounds 11a and
11b displayed significantly less antiproliferative activity in SYF
cells than dasatinib, suggesting increased selectivity against SRC
family kinases (Figure S3).
An automated 96-well scratch-wound cell migration assay
(analyzed in real-time by the IncuCyte ZOOM system) was
then set up to determine whether compound 11a could halt
migration of MDA-MB-231 cells, as would be expected for a
SRC inhibitor.49 Cells treated with 11a were monitored for 24
h at a dose range (1−10,000 nM) and compared with untreated
cells (0.1% v/v DMSO) and dasatinib treatment. Compound
11a significantly reduced cell motility at 10 nM as early as 6 h
into the study, with equivalent efficacy to dasatinib (Figure
4d,e). 11a treatments at higher concentrations induced greater
inhibition of cell migration (Figure S4), although cell viability
was also significantly reduced. Image-based measurement of
caspase 3/7 activity in MCF7 breast cancer cells demonstrated
significant levels of apoptotic cell death after 5 d treatment with
11a at concentrations ≥100 nM (Figure S4), in accordance
with the EC50 values observed for this cell line.

 recombinant kinases used in previous screenings (see IC50
values in Table 1 and dose−response curves in Figure S5). As
expected, dasatinib induced potent inhibition of nonreceptor
tyrosine kinases, such as ABL and SRC,22 but also high potency
against receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., PDGFRα, KIT). In
contrast, 11a exclusively inhibited SFK, with subnanomolar
IC50 values against SRC and YES (activities for the rest of the
SFK members are shown in Table S1). It is important to
highlight that 11a displayed a vast difference in activity (>950-
fold difference) between ABL and its primary target SRC.
While small molecule inhibitors with reverse binding
capabilities have been developed (e.g., imatinib strongly targets
ABL without inhibiting SRC),49 this is, to the best of our
knowledge, the first case of a small molecule with
subnanomolar IC50 for SRC that requires a concentration 3
orders of magnitude greater to reach the same level of
inhibition in ABL. Such properties have only been previously
reported in peptide-based bisubstrate inhibitors of SRC.50
Design and Synthesis of Compounds 12a−x and SAR
Analysis. To shed light over the structural features responsible
for the high antiproliferative properties and unique selectivity
profile of 11a, a library of 24 closely related analogs was
developed (see syntheses in the Supporting Information) by
introducing small changes on key functional groups of 11a (see
Figure 5). The activity of compounds 12a−x was then tested in
cells. MDA-MB-231 was the cell line chosen for the screening
due to its superior sensitivity to 11a treatment. Cell viability
assays were performed as previously described, and EC50 values
calculated for each compound. IC50 values were subsequently
determined against SRC and ABL for those compounds
exhibiting high antiproliferative activity (12d, 12e, 12m, 12w,
and 12x) and for selected compounds with low activity (12a,
12i, 12j, 12t, and 12v).
Analysis of the properties of compounds 12a−e (Figure 5)
indicates that the presence of a tertiary amino group at the
position 4 of the pyperidinyl ring is essential for the activity.
Substitution of the methyl groups by larger aliphatic rings was
tolerated, however, with compounds 12d and 12e being among
the most potent SRC inhibitors of the series. Removal of the
pyrimidine ring (see compound 12f) resulted in >3000-fold
decrease in antiproliferative activity. Screening of compounds
12g−x evidenced the limited structural variations permitted at
the top of the molecule to achieve high bioactivity. Most
modifications of the Boc and the methoxy groups of the phenyl
moiety at the C3 position led to a significant reduction in
bioactivity. Even minor chemical modifications such as the
substitution of the carbamate group by urea (12i) or amide
(12j), or the change of the methoxy by OH (12s), resulted in
>200-fold decrease in both antiproliferative properties and SRC
inhibitory activity. Remarkably, introduction of a benzylamino
group instead of the Boc was tolerated well, as observed from
the bioactivity exhibited by compound 12m. However,
introduction of endocyclic nitrogen atoms in the ring (see
12n and 12o) dramatically reduced compounds’ activity,
particularly in the ortho position. Interestingly, while the
methoxy group is required for maintaining high levels of activity
when the Boc group is present in the structure (see 12s−u),
substitution of the Boc group by an ester tolerated the
elimination of the methoxy group (see 12w and 12x).
Biochemical and in Silico Studies of 11a Binding to
the SRC Kinase. Most kinase inhibitors, especially adenine
analogues, bind to the catalytic domain of the enzyme in its
active conformation,22 thus competing with the natural
substrate ATP. To determine whether this was the mode of
binding of 11a to its primary target SRC, competitive inhibition
studies with ATP were performed (Reaction Biology Corp.,
USA). Experiments were designed to obtain Km values for ATP
in the absence and presence of different concentrations of
inhibitor 11a. The reactions were monitored every 10 min to
obtain progress curves with time course (Figure S6). These
were found to be linear regardless of the compound’s
concentration, suggesting that SRC inhibition by 11a is not
time-dependent (= reversible). The slopes (μM/min) were
represented against ATP concentration for a Michaelis−
Menten plot and a subsequent Lineweaver−Burk plot
(double-reciprocal plot), using GraphPad Prism software

 (Figure S6). Apparent Km increased when inhibitor concen-
tration increased and all lines converged on the Y-axis in the
double-reciprocal plot, thus suggesting that 11a is competitive
with respect to ATP against SRC. Dose−response curves of
SRC inhibition by 11a at different concentrations of ATP are
plotted in Figure S7. Calculated IC50 values increased in direct
proportion to ATP concentration, further confirming that 11a
is a type I kinase inhibitor and therefore binds to the SRC ATP
site in its active conformation. Global fit analysis using GraFit
software provided a Ki of 0.8 nM (Figure S7).
To gain insight on the selective binding affinity of 11a for
SRC over ABL, in silico docking studies were performed with
both the dual ABL/SRC inhibitor PP20 and the SRC-selective
inhibitor 11a. Docking of PP20 into SRC and ABL produced a
plausible predicted binding mode in both cases (Figure 6a,b),
with the adenine-mimicking pyrazolopyrimidine making H-
bonds to the hinge region of the proteins. The tert-butyl group
of the carbamate occupies a hydrophobic pocket formed by
several lipophilic residues in SRC and ABL, including the Phe
of their aspartate-phenylalanine-glycine (DFG) motif. Free
energy of binding was predicted by Autodock to be
approximately the same for both proteins (−8.5 and −8.9
kcal/mol, respectively). Docking of 11a into SRC also
produced a plausible predicted binding mode (Figure 6c) and
a higher predicted affinity than PP20 (calculated free energy of
binding of −10.6 kcal/mol). In SRC, the dimethylamino group
of the ethylpiperidinyl moiety on N1 interacts with Asp404, one
of the protein’s phosphate binding residues (see Figure
6c,e).21,22 In contrast, the large N1 group of 11a (compared
to the isopropyl on PP20) clashes with Tyr253 in the catalytic
site of ABL. This resulted in Autodock being unable to find a
position in the ATP binding site of ABL where 11a could
mimic the interactions made by the adenine moiety of ATP
(Figure 6d). This study indicates that the flexible polyamine
linker on N1 is responsible for the low affinity of compound
11a for ABL.
Phenotypic Screening of SRC Inhibitor 11a in Zebra-
fish. Developing zebrafish provides a rapid phenotypic assay to
simultaneously test safety and efficacy of novel compounds in a
living vertebrate.51 Small molecule phenotypic-based screens in
zebrafish have recently implicated SRC kinase in the migration
of the posterior lateral line primordium,52 a cohesive cluster of
cells that migrates horizontally under the skin along the
myoseptum to the end of the tail, periodically depositing
neuromasts. To determine the effects of 11a on cell migration
in vivo, we treated Tg(brn3c:mGFP) transgenic zebrafish53 that
express green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the mechanosen-
sory hair cells of the lateral line (which form part of the
neuromasts) with 11a for 2 d and measured the distance of the
last neuromast to the tip of the tail (marked by the end of the
notochord and the presence of black melanocytes, Figure 7a, in
red). 11a significantly reduced neuromast migration (>100 μm
in average) with minimal effect on the development of the
embryos (Figure 7a−c). In contrast, dasatinib treatment at >10
μM resulted in severe cardiotoxicity and death of most
embryos. At concentrations that were compatible with embryo
survival (1−10 μM), dasatinib did not inhibit the migration of
neuromasts, whereas it did still induce a patent cardiotoxic
phenotype (note heart enlargement in Figure 7c). Further
safety studies (see Figure S8) showed that dual ABL/SRC
inhibitor PP20 also induces severe cardiotoxicity in zebrafish
even after short treatment. These results, which correlate with
the essential role of ABL in heart development and healing,54,55
suggests that the selectivity of 11a over ABL might be
advantageous for therapy when ABL inhibition is not required.
Physicochemical and Drug Metabolism and Pharma-
cokinetics (DMPK) Profiling of SRC Inhibitor 11a in Vitro
and in Vivo. Compound 11a displays very high solubility in
water (>100 mg/mL, pH = 7.4), a significant advantage over
dasatinib, whose solubility in water ranges from moderate (18
mg/mL at pH = 2.6) to extremely low (<0.001 mg/mL at pH =
7).56 Notably, analysis of cLogP with the OSIRIS Property
Explorer57 provided an estimated value of 2.2 for 11a, while
experimental log D at pH = 7.4 was determined to be −0.04.
Inhibition of hERG channel and cytochrome P450 (CYP)
enzymes was determined for 11a to assess off-target liabilities
associated with cardiotoxicity (QT interval prolongation) and
potential drug−drug metabolic interactions. Results demon-
strated weak hERG inhibition (50.1% inhibition at 25 μM) and
marginal inhibition of CYP enzymes at 10 μM (Figure S9).
A plasma protein binding assay was performed with
compound 11a to test to what extent the compound can
bind to proteins in the blood, an important factor to predict
free drug levels in the body. Warfarin (positive control, 99−
100% bound) and 11a were incubated with human or rat
plasma in duplicates at 37 °C for 24 h and the free (unbound)
fraction of compound determined by LC-MS/MS. Percentages

 of unbound 11a were 9.4 and 19.1% in rat and human plasma,
respectively.
In vitro metabolic stability of 11a was systematically assessed
in human liver microsomes (HLM), blood plasma, and primary
hepatocytes (Cyprotex, UK). LC-MS/MS analysis of 11a
showed excellent compound stability (94%) after 30 min
incubation with HLM at 37 °C. 11a was subsequently
incubated (1 μM, 2 h, 37 °C) with plasma from either
human, mouse, or rat and analyzed by LC-MS/MS at different
time points. Regardless of the species, analyses showed full
plasma stability (Figure S10). Lastly, compound 11a (3 μM)
was incubated with mouse and human primary hepatocytes for
60 min and samples analyzed by LC-MS/MS at various time
points. Verapamil and umbelliferone were used as control
compounds. In agreement with the HLM study, compound 11a
showed high stability in human hepatocytes with a half-life of
751 min (Figure S10). As expected, faster clearance was
observed in mice hepatocytes (7-fold decrease in half-life).
Encouraged by the in vitro DMPK profile of 11a, an in vivo
study was performed in mice to determine oral bioavailability
and half-life (Cyprotex, U.K.). Female CD1 mice were given a
single dose of 10 mg/kg (0.25 mg/25 g mouse) of compound
11a orally (as a solution in nanopure water) or via IV injection
(as a saline solution). Blood/plasma samples were taken at
different time points (final sample taken after 8 h), and
compound levels measured by LC-MS/MS (Figure S11). The
calculated half-life value for 11a was 2.9 h, substantially higher
than that reported for dasatinib in mice (0.9 h).58 Compound
11a showed moderate oral bioavailability (25.3%), although it is
important to note that no excipients (just pure water) were
used for its oral formulation.
In Vivo SRC Inhibition Study in a Tumor Xenograft
Model. The presence of active (phosphorylated) SRC in
human colorectal cancer HCT116 cells and its inhibition under
11a treatment was verified by Western blot (Figure S12).
Subsequently, an in vivo PD study was performed in a xenograft
model of HCT116 cells in mice.59 HCT116 cells were injected
subcutaneously, and tumors were allowed to grow up to 3−4
mm in diameter. Subsequently, mice were dosed daily for 3 d
with 11a (50 mg/kg, in nanopure water) or vehicle (nanopure
water) by oral gavage and culled 3 h after the last dose (n = 4).
Tumors were excised, fixed, and sections labeled for phospho-
SRCY416 and stained with hematoxylin. As shown in Figure 8,
microscopy analysis demonstrated significant reduction of
phospho-SRCY416 in the xenograft sections from mice treated
with 11a relative to the untreated animal controls.
■ CONCLUSIONS
To move away from orthodox target-centric strategies, a
pragmatic approach for rapid discovery of novel high-quality
anticancer kinase inhibitors was implemented through the
generation and phenotypic screening of analogues of PP1, a
pyrazolopyrimidine known to inhibit multiple oncogenic
pathways.32−34 Derivatives of this promiscuous kinase inhibitor
were designed to improve physicochemical properties and
explore favorable pharmacological features through small
chemical modifications. To accelerate the advance from hits
to leads to drug candidates, compounds were screened by
phenotypic assays in the search for derivatives with potent
antiproliferative properties. Chemical design was biased toward
human breast cancer treatment (rather than to a particular
target) by using the breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF7 as a
discriminating cell model. Such a pseudotarget-agnostic strategy
identified compounds that inhibited pathways involved in
breast cancer survival and also disregarded compounds with
low cell penetrability (= deficient drug-likeness). After two
rounds of design, synthesis, and screening of highly focused
libraries, novel candidates with low micromolar activity in
MCF7 cells and high solubility in water were identified
(compounds 8d and 9d). Elucidation of the potential target/s
linked with their bioactivity was followed by a literature survey
to explore chemical motifs that could further improve these
phenotypic leads. From that point, two independent medicinal
chemistry campaigns were initiated. This manuscript has
focused on the development of SRC inhibitor 11a, a novel
pyrazolopyrimidine analogue that exhibits potent antiprolifer-
ative properties against breast cancer cells, halts MDA-MB-231
cell migration, and inhibits intracellular SRC signaling at low
nanomolar concentrations. Remarkably, kinase profiling
revealed that 11a is the first small molecule that inhibits SRC
at subnanomolar concentration (IC50 < 0.5 nM) with a 1000-
fold selectivity over ABL. This is of relevance because the
manifestation of cardiac events, especially in elderly patients, is
a well-established adverse effect of ABL inhibition.51,52
Synthesis and phenotypic screening of 24 closely related
derivatives of 11a were carried out to gain further insight into
the optimal chemical space for the generation of potent,
selective, and cell-active SRC inhibitors. Analysis of SAR
provided evidence of the strict structural requirements of the
pyrazolopyrimidine scaffold required to create such a class of
antiproliferative SRC/non-ABL inhibitors. The relatively low
molecular weight of 11a (510 Da) and its good physicochem-

 ical properties, including excellent water solubility and cLogP of
2.2, prompted us to investigate further the biological properties
of this compound. Biochemical and in silico studies confirm
that 11a is a Type I kinase inhibitor of SRC and provided
rationale for its selective affinity for SRC over ABL. Screening
of hERG channel and CYP induction, together with in vitro and
in vivo PK/PD assays (including zebrafish PD/safety studies)
support the nomination of 11a as a SRC-targeting drug
candidate that could potentially offer a superior therapeutic
window than dual SRC/ABL inhibitors.60,61 This novel SRC-
targeting inhibitor belongs to a second generation of SRC
inhibitors that do not target the ABL kinase,50,62 being the first
one to demonstrate suppression of SRC phosphorylation in
vivo. Finally, in concordance with the primary role of SRC in
driving tumor invasion and drug resistance mechanisms,63,64
more in-depth preclinical proof-of-concept studies using
appropriate in vivo models of disease progression and rational
drug combination studies will be required to demonstrate the
efficacy and therapeutic value of SRC/no-ABL inhibitors in
cancer treatment.
■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Synthetic Procedures. General Methods. Microwave-irradiated
reactions were carried out in a Biotage Initiator microwave synthesizer.
Nonmicrowave reactions were performed under an inert atmosphere
of nitrogen using anhydrous solvents. All commercially available
chemicals were obtained from either Fisher Scientific, Matrix Scientific,
Sigma-Aldrich, or VWR International Ltd. NMR spectra were
recorded at ambient temperature on a 500 MHz Bruker Avance III
spectrometer. Samples were dissolved in deuterated solvents
commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich. Chemical shifts are
reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to the peak of the
solvent. The data are presented as follows: chemical shift, integration,
multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, m =
multiplet), coupling constants (in Hertz, Hz) and interpretation. TLCs
were ran on Merck TLC Silica gel 60 F254 plates, typically 5 × 10 cm,
and monitored using a 254 nm UV source or permanganate staining.
Purifications were carried out using flash column chromatography with
commercially available silica gel and solvents. All compounds used in
the biological screenings were determined to be >95% pure by
analytical HPLC with evaporative light scattering detection (Agilent).

ethyl]pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-3-yl]-2-methoxy-phenyl]carbamate
(11a, aka eCF509). To a solution of 10a (50 mg, 0.1205 mmol) in
dioxane/water (4.5 mL/0.5 mL) were added [4-(tert-butoxycarbony-
lamino)-3-methoxy-phenyl]boronic acid (1.5 equiv, 48.3 mg, 0.181
mmol), potassium carbonate (1.5 equiv, 25.0 mg, 0.181 mmol), and
triphenylphosphine (20 mol %, 9.5 mg), followed by palladium acetate
(5 mol %), and the mixture heated in the microwave at 120 °C for 1 h.
EtOAc (50 mL) and water (50 mL) were added to the mixture, and
the organic layer separated. The aqueous layer was washed with EtOAc
(20 mL, ×2), and the organics combined, dried over anhydrous
MgSO4, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was purified by
column chromatography, MeOH/DCM (0−10% then 5−20 drops of
NH3 aq. per 100 mL) to give a light brown solid (23.1 mg, 0.0453

Biological Studies. General Methods. MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and
SYF cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM),
supplemented with serum (10% fetal bovine serum) and L-glutamine
(2 mM), and incubated in a Heracell 240i tissue culture incubator at
37 °C and 5% CO2.
Time-Lapse Cell Growth Assay. Cells were plated in 96-well Nunc
black optical-bottom plates (Thermo Scientific) at 1000 cells/well in
100 μL of DMEM medium containing 10% FBS and 2 mM L-
glutamine and incubated for 48 h in an incubator at 37 °C and 5%
CO2. The media was replaced with fresh media containing 100 μM
concentration of 7a−l, PP1, or DMSO (0.1% v/v), and the plates
imaged in the IncuCyte ZOOM system. Cell growth was monitored at
sequential time points over 5 d using the bright-field microscopic
images acquired by the IncuCyte ZOOM system. Cell confluence
determination was performed by the IncuCyte software.
Dose−Response Viability Assay. Cells were plated in 96-well plates
at 2000 cells/well in 100 μL of DMEM medium containing 10% FBS
and 2 mM L-glutamine and incubated for 48 h in an incubator at 37 °C
and 5% CO2. After 48 h, the media was aspirated from each well and
replaced with 95 μL of fresh medium. Compounds, including DMSO,
were prepared at 20× in DMEM medium in a separate 96-well
intermediate plate. 5 μL from the intermediate plate was then added to
each well containing cells. Untreated cells were incubated with DMSO
(0.1% v/v). After 5 d, PrestoBlue cell viability reagent (10 μL) was
added to each well, and the plates incubated for 60−90 min.
Fluorescence emission was detected using an Envision fluorescence
plate reader (excitation 540 nm, emission 590 nm). All conditions
were normalized to the untreated cells (100%), and curves were fitted
using a four parameter logistic fit with minimum value constrained to
zero using GraphPad Prism software, to calculate EC50 values.
Apoptosis Assay. Cells were plated in 96-well Nunc black optical-
bottom plates (Thermo Scientific) at 3000 cells/well in 100 μL of
DMEM medium containing 10% FBS and 2 mM L-glutamine and
incubated for 48h in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The media
was replaced with 95 μL of fresh media containing NucView 488 from
Biotium at 1 μM concentration, and drugs or DMSO added along a
concentration gradient, as described in the cell viability assay, and the
plates imaged in the IncuCyte. Cell growth was monitored over 5 days
using bright-field and NucView 488 fluorescence (excitation 460 nm,
emission 524 nm) microscopy. Cell confluence and apoptotic count
(positive NucView 488 emission signal threshold above background
signal) were performed by the IncuCyte software. The numbers
generated from the applied confluence and NucView 488 labeled cells
masks were divided so as to create a ratio of number of apoptotic cells
to cell confluence. The data were then normalized to DMSO to
account for the decreased number of cells found in higher
concentrations of drug treatment.
Western Blotting. Cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/well in 2 mL of
DMEM medium containing 10% FBS and 2 mM L-glutamine in 6-well
plates and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After 24 h, the media was
aspirated and replaced with 2 mL of DMEM medium containing 0.1%
FBS and 2 mM L-glutamine and the cells incubated for a further 24 h.
Two μL of compounds dissolved in DMSO at appropriate
concentration was then added to each well and plates incubated for
1.5 h. 222 μL of FBS was then added to each well (giving a final
concentration of 10%), and cells incubated for 1 h. Cell lysates were
then prepared using 100 μL of cell lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50
mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA,
100 mM NaF, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10%
glycerol and protease and phosphatase inhibitors) per well. The total
cell protein concentration in each lysate was determined using
precision red advanced protein reagent #2 from Cytoskeleton. Lysates
were normalized to 2 mg/mL and boiled at 100 °C for 3 min in SDS-
PAGE sample buffer (40% glycerol, 8% SDS, 0.1 M DTT, 0.25 M Tris-
HCl, pH 6.8). Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE using BioRad 4−
15% precast gels over 60 min at 140 V and transferred to PVDF
membranes over 150 min at 210 mA. Nonspecific antibody binding
was blocked by incubation of membranes for 1 h at room temperature
using western blocking reagent solution (Roche) prior to adding
primary antibodies in 0.5% blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight.
Membranes were washed with TBS/T (×3, 5 min) and then
secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) added
for 1 h at room temperature. Following further washing with TBS/T
(×3, 5 min) and TBS (×2, 5 min), HRP was detected by peroxidase
enhanced chemiluminescence (POD ECL from Roche) and bands
visualized using X-ray film or the ChemiDoc MP Imaging System from
BioRad.
Cell Migration Assay. Cells were plated at 50,000 cells/well in 100
μL of DMEM medium containing 10% FBS and 2 mM L-glutamine in
a 96-well ImageLock plate from Essen BioScience and left overnight to
adhere in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Scratch wounds were
created in each well using the WoundMaker supplied by Essen
BioScience, and each well washed with media (100 μL, ×2) to remove
floating cells. 95 μL of fresh media was added in each well.
Compounds, including DMSO, were prepared at 20× in DMEM
medium in a separate plate, and 5 μL was then added to each well
containing cells. Untreated cells were incubated with DMSO (0.1% v/
v). Images were recorded every 30 min using the IncuCyte-ZOOM for
24 h. Analysis of cell migration into the wound was performed using
the IncuCyte software.
Kinase Screening Assays - IC50 Determination. Radioisotope-based
assay ([γ-33P] ATP) consisting of measuring 33P incorporation on the
substrate (poly [Glu, Tyr] 4:1) relative to DMSO. Compound IC50
values were determined from 10-point, 1:3 dilution curves starting at
10 μM, by Reaction Biology Corp, with 10 μM ATP.
Evaluation of ATP Competition and Ki Value for 11a against
SRC. Materials: Inhibitor: 10 mM stock solution of 11a in DMSO.
Kinase reaction buffer: 20 mM HEPES-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 1
mM EGTA, 0.02% Brij35, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 0.02 mg/mL BSA, 2 mM
DTT, and 1% DMSO. Kinase: SRC; recombinant human full length
cytoplasmic domain (accession no. NP_005408), C-terminal His-
tagged, expressed in insect cells, MW = 62.3 kDa. Substrate for kinase:
poly [Glu, Tyr] 4:1. Reaction conditions: 0.6 nM SRC, 0.2 mg/mL

 poly [Glu, Tyr] 4:1, and varied ATP. Experimental procedure: The
kinase assays were performed at room temperature. 11a was added as
10-point dose IC50 mode into the enzyme/substrate mixture using
acoustic technology with 20 min preincubation. Then the five
concentrations of ATP were added to initiate the reaction. The
activity was monitored every 5−15 min for a time course study. The
ATP, substrate, and 11a concentrations tested were as follows: (i)
ATP concentrations tested: 1, 5, 15, 75, and 150 μM ATP; (ii)
substrate concentration: constant at 0.2 mg/mL; (iii) 11a concen-
trations tested: 10-point dose IC50 with 3-fold serial dilution started at
100 nM; (iv) time points measured: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90,
105, and 120 min.
Docking Studies. Crystal structures of SRC and ABL were
examined for their suitability for docking. PDB 3GEQ was selected
to represent SRC as it contained pyrazolopyrimidine ligand PP2,
which most closely resembles compounds PP20 and 11a, and its DFG
motif is in the active conformation. Similarly, PDB 4TWP was selected
as the ABL structure as its DFG motif is also flipped in the ATP-
interacting position. The side chain of Asp381 in the ABL DFG motif
was manually rotated in PyMol to match the ATP-binding mode of the
equivalent Asp in SRC. ABL in this structure also contains a T316I
mutation which was reverted to wild type. Models of PP20 and 11a
were built using the structure and binding mode of PP2 as a template.
Water molecules and other heteroatoms were removed from the
optimized structures, and the program PDB 2PQR 1.865 used to
assigned position-optimized hydrogen atoms, utilizing the additional
PropKa66 algorithm with a pH of 7.4 to predict protonation states. The
MGLTools 1.5.4 utility prepare_receptor4.py was used to assign
Gasteiger charges to atoms. Hydrogen atoms were assigned to
compound structures using OpenBabel 2.3.2,67 utilizing the -p option
to predict the protonation states of functional groups at pH 7.4. The
MGLTools utility prepare_ligand4.py68 was used to assign Gasteiger
charges and rotatable bonds. Autodock 4.2.369 was used to
automatically dock the compounds into the ATP binding pocket of
the crystal structures. A grid box that encompassed the maximum
dimensions of the cognate ATP ligand plus 12 Å in each direction was
used. The starting translation and orientation of the ligand and the
torsion angles of all rotatable bonds were set to those of the modeled
compounds. The Autogrid grid point spacing was set at 0.2 Å. The
Autodock parameter file specified 10 Lamarckian genetic algorithm
runs, 15,000,000 energy evaluations and a population size of 300.
Zebrafish PD/Toxicology Assay. Transgenic Tg(brn3c:mGFP)
zebrafish embryos were collected from breeding pairs and reared at
28 °C in E3 embryo media. One dpf embryos were treated with 11a at
different doses (10−750 μM) at 20 hpf, 36 hpf and 48 hpf, or DMSO
(0.1% v/v). Zebrafish embryos were imaged by fluorescent microscopy
at 72 hpf. Safety assays: Wild-type zebrafish embryos were collected
from AB-TPL breeding pairs and reared at 28 °C in E3 embryo media.
One dpf embryos were treated with 11a or dasatinib at 100 μM, and
DMSO (0.1% v/v) as negative control, for 4 h before being washed off
and replaced with fresh E3 media. For PP20 treatment, the fish were
incubated for 2 h post-amputation then replaced with fresh E3 media.
The embryos were left to develop in E3 media at 28 °C for 2 d, after
which, they were imaged by light microscopy. Zebrafish husbandry was
performed under Home Office License in compliance with the
Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and approved by the
University of Edinburgh Ethics Committee.
In Vivo PK Analysis. Three female cluster of differentiation 1 (CD1)
mice, 25−30 g, were dosed per administration route per time point,
per compound. 11a was administered either orally or intravenously
(typical dose level of 10 mg compound per kg body weight). Animals
were given free access to food throughout the study. At the following
time points, the animals were anaesthetised, blood collected in
heparinised tubes, and animals sacrificed: (i) oral dosing: 0.08, 0.25,
0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 h post-dose; (ii) IV dosing: 0.08, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4,
and 8 h post-dose.
In Vivo PD Study. Tumor xenografts were generated in mice by
injection of 2 million HCT116 cells subcutaneously. Tumors were
allowed to grow until 3−4 mm in diameter. A daily dose of 50 mg/kg
of 11a in pure water was administered by oral gavage. Mice were
sacrificed 3 h after the last dose and tumors excised, fixed in 4%
formaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), and embedded in
paraffin. Sections were cut using a Reichert-Jung 1150/Autocut
microtome to perform phospho-SRC immunochemistry. Antigen
retrieval was performed using heat treatment under pressure in a
microwave oven for 10 min in 10 mM citrate buffer pH = 6. Sections
were blocked for endogenous peroxidase followed by incubation with
antiphospho-SRC antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) (1:200
dilution) at 4 °C overnight. Staining was developed using EnVision
(Dako) and diaminobenzidene (Dako) before slides were counter-
stained in hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted in dibutyl phthalate
xylene. Slices were imaged on a NanoZoomer digital slide scanner,
Hammamatsu. Staining was scored by a single experienced observer,
blinded to treatment, using a weighted histoscore method.
