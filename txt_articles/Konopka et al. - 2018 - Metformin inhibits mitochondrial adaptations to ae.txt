Abstract
Metformin and exercise independently improve insulin sensitivity and decrease the
risk of diabetes. Metformin was also recently proposed as a potential therapy to
slow aging. However, recent evidence indicates that adding metformin to exercise
antagonizes the exercise‐induced improvement in insulin sensitivity and cardiorespi-
ratory fitness. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that metformin
diminishes the improvement in insulin sensitivity and cardiorespiratory fitness after
aerobic exercise training (AET) by inhibiting skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration
and protein synthesis in older adults (62 ± 1 years). In a double‐blinded fashion, par-
ticipants were randomized to placebo (n = 26) or metformin (n = 27) treatment dur-
ing 12 weeks of AET. Independent of treatment, AET decreased fat mass, HbA1c,
fasting plasma insulin, 24‐hr ambulant mean glucose, and glycemic variability. How-
ever, metformin attenuated the increase in whole‐body insulin sensitivity and
VO2max after AET. In the metformin group, there was no overall change in whole‐
body insulin sensitivity after AET due to positive and negative responders.
Metformin also abrogated the exercise‐mediated increase in skeletal muscle mito-
chondrial respiration. The change in whole‐body insulin sensitivity was correlated to
the change in mitochondrial respiration. Mitochondrial protein synthesis rates
assessed during AET were not different between treatments. The influence of met-
formin on AET‐induced improvements in physiological function was highly variable
and associated with the effect of metformin on the mitochondria. These data sug-
gest that prior to prescribing metformin to slow aging, additional studies are needed
to understand the mechanisms that elicit positive and negative responses to met-
formin with and without exercise.

INTRODUCTION
The declines in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), glucose control, and
insulin sensitivity are predictors of disease, disability, and all‐cause
mortality (Blair et al., 1989; Facchini, Hua, Abbasi, & Reaven, 2001;
Zaslavsky, Walker, Crane, Gray, & Larson, 2016). The age‐related loss
of CRF and insulin sensitivity is associated with lower mitochondrial
protein synthesis (biogenesis), abundance, and respiration and ele-
vated reactive oxygen species emissions (ROS) (Anderson et al.,
2009; Rooyackers, Adey, Ades, & Nair, 1996; Short et al., 2005).
Additionally, the decline in mitochondrial function is directly linked
with telomere shortening (Sahin et al., 2011). Telomeres, protective
caps at the ends of chromosomes, are critical features for maintain-
ing genome integrity and stability in response to a variety of cellular
stresses (e.g., cell division and oxidative stress) and lifestyle factors
(e.g., nutrition and exercise). Therefore, telomeres may provide an
integrated cellular measure of general health and biological aging.
Aerobic exercise is considered the gold standard approach to
increase CRF and peripheral insulin sensitivity across the lifespan.
Findings from prospective studies suggest a greater CRF and insulin
sensitivity impart protection from the onset of age‐related chronic
disease (Blair et al., 1989; Facchini et al., 2001). While the molecular
transducers that give rise to the pleiotropic health benefits of exercise
are still being elucidated, the energetic stress of exercise increases
AMP‐activated kinase (AMPK) activity (See Richter & Ruderman, 2009
for review). AMPK is considered an energy sensor of the cell and, in
response to energetic stress, increases energy‐producing processes
such as skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and insulin‐stimu-
lated glucose uptake. In line with this notion, we and others have
shown that increased skeletal muscle mitochondrial protein synthesis
and respiration as well as decreased ROS emissions may contribute to
improved CRF and peripheral insulin sensitivity after aerobic exercise
training (AET; Konopka et al., 2015; Robinson et al., 2017).
The biguanide metformin is the most widely prescribed medica-
tion to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and there is also a
growing interest in using metformin to treat aging and delay the
onset of multiple age‐related diseases (Barzilai, Crandall, Kritchevsky,
& Espeland, 2016). Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production
(Hundal et al., 2000) and increases peripheral glucose disposal in
adults with and without T2DM (Malin, Gerber, Chipkin, & Braun,
2012; Musi et al., 2002). Collectively, the glucose‐lowering effect of
metformin appears, like exercise, to be through an energetic stress
and/or redox mechanism in both skeletal muscle and liver. Metformin
inhibits mitochondrial respiration at complex I (CI) of the electron
transport system (Brunmair et al., 2004; Wessels, Ciapaite, van den
Broek, Nicolay, & Prompers, 2014), which stimulates an energetic
stress in skeletal muscle and activates AMPK for glucose uptake
(Malin et al., 2012; Musi et al., 2002). Additionally, metformin may
improve insulin sensitivity by decreasing skeletal muscle mitochon-
drial ROS emissions (Kane et al., 2010). Therefore, within skeletal
muscle, the mechanisms of action for metformin appear to be due to
an inhibitory effect at the level of the mitochondria which alter the
energetic and/or redox status of the cell.
The U.S. Diabetes Prevention Program (USDPP) demonstrated that
both lifestyle modification, including 150 min of moderate intensity
exercise per week, and metformin independently prevented the pro-
gression from prediabetes to T2DM by 58% and 31%, respectively
(Knowler et al., 2002). Several studies have since tested the effects of
metformin plus exercise to determine whether the combination would
elicit favorable synergistic or unfavorable antagonistic effects on phys-
iological function implicated in age‐related chronic disease. Evidence
now suggests that the addition of metformin to acute or chronic exer-
cise does not induce an additive effect but instead inhibits the exer-
cise‐mediated improvements in CRF and insulin sensitivity (Malin
et al., 2012; Sharoff et al., 2010). The mechanisms mediating the
antagonistic interaction between metformin and exercise on physio-
logical function involved in healthy aging are unknown.
Aerobic exercise training and metformin independently have pos-
itive effects on the improvement of whole‐body and peripheral insu-
lin sensitivity (Konopka et al., 2015, 2016; Malin et al., 2012; Musi
et al., 2002; Robinson et al., 2017) through overlapping yet distinct
cellular mechanisms. A classic adaptation to the energetic demands
of AET is to increase the capacity for energy production through
mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial respiration while met-
formin generates an energetic stress by inhibiting mitochondrial res-
piration with unknown effects on mitochondrial biogenesis. Due to
the juxtaposition of metformin and AET at the level of the mito-
chondria, we tested the hypothesis that metformin restricts the
increase in CRF and insulin sensitivity after 12 weeks of AET in
older adults free of chronic disease by inhibiting the increase in
skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration and protein synthesis.

RESULTS
2.1

Physical and clinical characteristics
All participants were free of chronic disease but had at least one risk
factor for T2DM: fasting glucose 100–125 mg/dl, 2‐hr glucose 140–
199 mg/dl, HbA1c (5.7%–6.4%), or family history of T2DM. Forty‐
two participants (80%) had family history of T2DM, and 14 (26%)
were taking statins throughout the study. All participants were met-
formin naïve. The dose was decreased from 2,000 to 1,500 mg/day
in 11 participants who reported gastrointestinal discomfort (placebo
n = 3; metformin n = 8). Pill compliance was 98% as calculated by
returned pill count. Table 1 shows the participants’ physical and clini-
cal characteristics. The 12 weeks of AET decreased (p < 0.05) body
weight, independent of metformin or placebo, which was largely due
to the reduction (p < 0.001) in whole body, trunk, and leg fat mass.
Fat‐free mass was not statistically different after the intervention.

Cardiorespiratory fitness, whole‐body insulin
sensitivity, and glucose regulation
Figure 1a
demonstrates that
VO2max (L/min) was significantly
increased after 12 weeks of AET (p < 0.05, main effect for time)
with a significant increase within the placebo group (p < 0.01) but

 not metformin. Metformin attenuated the increase in VO2max fol-
lowing 12 weeks of AET by ~50%, although this did not reach statis-
tical significance (p = 0.08, Figure 1b). After an overnight fast,
subjects completed a blood chemistry assessment and oral glucose
tolerance test (OGTT). HbA1c (%), fasting insulin, and HOMA‐IR
were decreased (p < 0.05) after 12 weeks of AET, independent of
metformin or placebo (Table 1). There was a significant interaction
(p < 0.05, time by treatment) for an increase in whole‐body insulin
sensitivity, evaluated by the Matsuda index, after AET with placebo
but not metformin (Figure 1c). On average, the increase in whole‐
body insulin sensitivity after AET was inhibited (p = 0.02) by met-
formin (Figure 1d). The change in insulin sensitivity after AET with
metformin was highly variable compared to placebo as evident by
approximately twice the SE (4.0 vs. 2.1). Further, there was a
dichotomous response to AET with metformin where 58% of partici-
pants were positive responders with increased insulin sensitivity and
42%
responded
negatively
with
decreased
insulin
sensitivity
(Figure 1d). Similarly, the oral glucose sensitivity index (OGSI) (Fig-
ure 1e,f), an estimate of glucose clearance, followed a similar pattern
as the Matsuda index where there was a significant interaction
(p < 0.05, time by treatment) between placebo and metformin. Post-
prandial glucose and insulin area under the curve (AUC) were not
different after the intervention, independent of placebo or met-
formin.
To further assess glucose regulation, we used continuous glucose
monitors (CGM) in a subset of 17 individuals (placebo n = 9; met-
formin n = 8) for ~7 days on three separate occasions, before, dur-
ing, and after the intervention. Interstitial glucose was measured
every 5 min (288 measurements per 24 hr) to determine several
indices of glucose behavior and variability. Compared to before AET,
we found that 24‐hr mean ambulant glucose and mean amplitude of
glycemic excursions (MAGE), an index of postprandial glucose excur-
sions, were lower during (p < 0.05), but no longer statistically differ-
ent after AET, independent of placebo or metformin (Figure 1g,h).
Since these measurements are taken during free‐living situations
where diet was not standardized, we also performed an exploratory
analysis of glucose behavior for the 5 hr that consisted of the stan-
dardized aerobic exercise session and post‐exercise nutrition as
shown in Figure 1i. We observed the expected exercise‐induced
decline and postprandial rise in glucose, but we did not detect a sta-
tistical difference in glucose AUC between groups.

Skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration
Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis to
evaluate mitochondrial respiration in permeabilized muscle fibers. To
determine the chronic adaptation to the intervention while avoiding
the acute influence of exercise and metformin, muscle biopsies were
obtained 48 hr after the last exercise bout and 36 hr after the last
metformin dose. Since a putative role of metformin is to inhibit com-
plex I (CI), we used two protocols to assess mitochondrial respiration
that was initiated by providing CI‐linked substrates pyruvate, gluta-
mate, and malate. In the first protocol (SUIT1), we used an ADP
bolus to stimulate maximal oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS; P)
to evaluate CIP followed by provision of octanoylcarnitine and succi-
nate to assess fatty acid oxidation (CI&FAOP) and complex II‐linked
(CI+II&FAOP) respiration, respectively. Last, the protonophore FCCP
was added to stimulate maximal uncoupled electron transport sys-
tem capacity (ETS; CI+II&FAOE). Before the intervention, CIP was
correlated with whole‐body insulin sensitivity (Figure 2a). After

 12 weeks of AET, the change in CIP was also correlated with the
change in whole‐body insulin sensitivity (Figure 2b). The relationship
between the change in CIP and whole‐body insulin sensitivity was
primarily driven by the differences observed after AET when taking
placebo rather than metformin. With placebo, AET nonsignificantly
increased CIP and CI+FAOP (both p = 0.07) and this trend was not
apparent with metformin (Figure 2c,d). Further, the change in
CI+II&FAOP was greater (p < 0.05) in placebo versus metformin
(Figure 2e).
In the second protocol (ADP titration), we titrated ADP to
stimulate submaximal and maximal CIP followed by CI+IIP and
CI+IIE. From the ADP titration curve, we estimated the apparent
ADP Km and Vmax using Michaelis–Menten kinetics. The AET‐in-
duced increases in submaximal and maximal CI‐linked respiration
(Figure 2f,g) as well as Vmax (Figure 2h) were abolished by met-
formin. In contrast, the apparent ADP Km was not different
between placebo and metformin after the 12‐week intervention
(Figure 2i). The change in mitochondrial submaximal and maximal

Skeletal muscle telomere length
Since telomeres regulate genome stability and are directly linked
with mitochondrial function, we aimed to understand whether exer-
cise with or without metformin may influence telomere length.
Skeletal muscle telomere length was measured in 47 study partici-
pants (22 placebo; 25 metformin) using qRT–PCR. Telomere length
was significantly increased after 12‐weeks of AET (p < 0.001) inde-
pendent of metformin or placebo treatment (Figure 3).

Skeletal muscle protein synthesis and nutrient
sensing
Cumulative skeletal muscle protein synthesis rates were measured
during the last 4 weeks of the intervention in subcellular fractions
enriched with mitochondrial, cytoplasmic, and myofibrillar proteins.
There were no significant differences between placebo and met-
formin in synthesis rates for any subcellular muscle protein fraction
(Figure 4a).
We probed for several nutrient‐sensing proteins involved in
adjusting skeletal muscle protein synthesis and insulin action. In the
current study, there were no significant differences in AMPK phos-
phorylation/total (Figure 4b). We also assessed the activation of AKT
at two binding sites, T308 and S473, since they are upstream signal-
ing proteins involved in protein synthesis and insulin action. AET
increased (p < 0.05, main effect for time) AKT phosphorylation/total
at T308 and S473 independent of placebo or metformin (Figure 4c,
d). 4eBP1 and RpS6 are downstream of AKT phosphorylation/total
and mTOR and involved in protein translation initiation and regula-

DISCUSSION
This study shows in older adults at risk for T2DM, but free of
chronic disease that a clinical dose of metformin inhibited the
improvement in skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration and attenu-
ated the increase in CRF and whole‐body insulin sensitivity after
AET. The change in insulin sensitivity was correlated with the
change in CI‐linked respiration after AET in the placebo but not met-
formin group. Collectively, these data suggest that metformin attenu-
ated the improvements in whole‐body physiological function after
12 weeks of AET, in part, by preventing the increase in skeletal mus-
cle mitochondrial respiration without affecting mitochondrial protein
synthesis. Metformin did not diminish the improvements in HbA1c,
fasting insulin, 24‐hr mean glucose, and fat mass or the increase in
skeletal muscle telomere length after AET. Since CRF and insulin
sensitivity are primary predictors of age‐related morbidity and mor-
tality, these data raise concerns about broad recommendations for
the use of metformin as a treatment to target aging.

Metformin attenuates the improvement in
physiological function after aerobic exercise training
Cardiorespiratory fitness is one of the strongest risk factors for dis-
ease and mortality and high levels of CRF impart protection against
development of cardiometabolic disease (Blair et al., 1989). CRF
decreases with age while AET is commonly recommended to
increase CRF and delay the onset of cardiometabolic disease during
advancing age. Our findings in older adults at risk for T2DM demon-
strate that compared to placebo, metformin blunted the improve-
ment in CRF by ~50% after 12 weeks of AET. These data confirm
previous reports that metformin also tended to diminish the increase
in CRF by ~40%–60% in middle‐aged prediabetic and T2DM after
10 and 22 weeks of exercise training, respectively (Boulé et al.,
2013; Malin et al., 2012). Within these previous studies, the inhibi-
tory effect of metformin was explicitly observed with exercise train-
ing while there was no influence of metformin on CRF in sedentary
control subjects. Additionally, metformin decreased CRF in healthy,
active adults (Braun et al., 2008). Collectively, these results indicate
a consistent pattern whereby metformin appears to blunt the
increase in CRF after exercise training.
In the current study, we show that metformin inhibits the aero-
bic exercise‐induced increase in whole‐body insulin sensitivity esti-
mated during a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test. Postprandial insulin

 sensitivity incorporates both hepatic and peripheral tissues, but the
majority is determined by peripheral glucose disposal (DeFronzo
et
al.,
1981).
Although
exercise
and
metformin
independently
improve insulin sensitivity (Konopka et al., 2015, 2016; Malin et al.,
2012; Musi et al., 2002; Robinson et al., 2017), our findings are con-
sistent with previous reports that metformin attenuated the increase
in peripheral insulin sensitivity by 30%–50% when assessed by a
hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamp after both an acute exercise
bout and 12 weeks of exercise training (Malin et al., 2012; Sharoff
et al., 2010). While the overall change in whole‐body insulin sensitiv-
ity after AET with metformin was not different from baseline, we
did observe a divergent response where nearly half of the partici-
pants increased and half of the participants decreased insulin
sensitivity.
Emerging evidence suggests that acute exercise plus metformin
therapy may result in a lower postprandial glucose excursion com-
pared to exercise or metformin alone (Erickson, Little, Gay, McCully,
& Jenkins, 2017). In the current study, besides consuming standard-
ized nutrition immediately after exercise, we did not control for tim-
ing of dietary intake or metformin consumption in relation to their
exercise bout. It is therefore plausible that the timing of metformin,
nutrition, and exercise needs to be highly controlled to minimize the
inhibitory effects of metformin on exercise‐induced improvements of
insulin sensitivity. However, our findings in participants who wore
CGM are not in line with this notion as we demonstrated a decrease
in 24‐hr mean glucose and glycemic variability during the interven-
tion, independent of metformin or placebo treatment. The decrease
in 24‐hr glucose during AET was lost during the 7 days after the last
exercise training bout which is consistent with previous work that
demonstrates the glucoregulatory benefits of exercise dissipate after
3 days of inactivity (King et al., 1995). Elevated glucose in nondia-
betic individual (110–115 mg/dl) was associated with increased risk
of age‐related conditions such as dementia and frailty compared to
those with normal glucose values (<100 mg/dl; Crane et al., 2013;
Zaslavsky et al., 2016). Conversely, individuals with a propensity for
long life had a lower 24‐hr mean glucose compared to normal age‐
matched controls (Wijsman et al., 2013). Additional research is
needed to determine whether lowering mean glucose, glycemic vari-
ability, or both are critical factors involved in mediating healthy long-
evity in humans. Even though we find that metformin diminished
two key positive health benefits of exercise, CRF and insulin sensi-
tivity, metformin did not hinder nor accentuate the improvement in
24‐hr mean glucose, HbA1c, or fasting plasma insulin with AET.
These data suggest that the effects of metformin are highly variable
not only within a given outcome like insulin sensitivity but also
across outcomes related to glucoregulation.

Metformin abolishes the improvement in
mitochondrial respiration after aerobic exercise
training
We report that the correlation between the change in CI‐linked
mitochondrial respiration and insulin sensitivity after AET was driven
by the relationship in the placebo (r = 0.53) group rather than met-
formin (r = 0.13), which suggests that metformin may act on the
mitochondria at CI to disrupt the relationship between insulin sensi-
tivity and mitochondrial respiration. Our findings largely indicate that
metformin inhibits the increase in submaximal and maximal CI‐linked
skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration after AET. Metformin abol-
ished the ~25% increase in maximal CI‐linked respiration after AET
during the ADP titration. No other studies have evaluated the
impact of metformin on mitochondrial adaptations to aerobic exer-
cise, but our findings are consistent with the 21% decrease in maxi-
mal CI‐linked respiration in isolated mitochondria from lean and
diabetic sedentary rats treated with metformin (100 mg kg−1 day−1)
(Wessels et al., 2014). Although not all in vivo studies demonstrate a
decrease in maximal CI‐linked respiration by metformin (Kane et al.,
2010), numerous in vitro studies (Brunmair et al., 2004; Owen,
Doran, & Halestrap, 2000; Wheaton et al., 2014) support the pre-
mise that metformin inhibits CI of the ETS. Metformin decreases
cancer cell and fibroblast proliferation by inhibiting CI of the ETS
(Wheaton et al., 2014). By overexpressing NDI1, a subunit within CI
that oxidizes NADH, cells were no longer susceptible to the inhibi-
tory effect of metformin (Wheaton et al., 2014). Collectively, these
data
support
the
concept
that
one
mechanism
of
action
for
metformin is linked to CI of the mitochondria.
The increase in maximal and submaximal mitochondrial respira-
tory capacity after AET can result from improved intrinsic mitochon-
drial function and/or increased abundance of mitochondria. By
adding FCCP to uncouple OXPHOS and ATP synthesis, we can
determine the contribution of OXPHOS to maximal ETS capacity as
an index of intrinsic mitochondrial function to infer whether changes
in respiration were independent from mitochondrial abundance. The
prevailing hypothesis is that a low P/E represents a reserve capacity
that is not being utilized and may be an indicator of poor coupling
efficiency. We have previously shown that a low P/E is observed in
the
sedentary
or
untrained
state
and
increases
with
exercise
(Konopka et al. 2017; Miller et al., 2017). In the current study, the
improvement in P/E after AET was inhibited by metformin which
suggests that metformin acts directly on the ETS to alter intrinsic
mitochondrial function independently of influencing mitochondrial
biogenesis or abundance.
In addition to respiration, the mitochondria also produce reactive
oxygen species (ROS). Since both exercise (Konopka et al., 2015)
and metformin (Kane et al., 2010; Madiraju et al., 2014) have been
shown to alter mitochondrial respiration, ROS emissions, and/or cel-
lular redox status, we sought to evaluate an integrated outcome
influenced by all these variables. Telomere length, a well‐established
indicator of cellular aging, has been directly linked to compromised
mitochondrial function and oxidative stress (Sahin et al., 2011; von
Zglinicki, 2000). Previous cross‐sectional studies have demonstrated
greater telomere length in leukocytes and skeletal muscle of endur-
ance exercise‐trained adults (LaRocca, Seals, & Pierce, 2010; Østhus
et al., 2012), we show for the first time that just 12 weeks of AET
increased skeletal muscle telomere length, independent of metformin
treatment. These data add to the evidence that exercise is an effec-
tive geroprotective intervention.
3.3
|
Influence of metformin on skeletal muscle
protein synthesis and nutrient sensing
Aerobic exercise and metformin have been shown to alter key intra-
cellular nutrient‐sensing pathways. We reasoned that the cellular
energy sensor AMPK would have increased activity due to the ener-
getic stress of metformin preventing the increase in mitochondrial
respiration in response to the energetic demands of AET. The influ-
ence of exercise and metformin on skeletal muscle AMPK activation
is transient, and effects on this signaling node were likely lost by
48 hr after exercise and 36 hr after the last metformin dose (Richter
& Ruderman, 2009). In contrast to AMPK, AET increased AKT T308
and S473 which suggests the blunted improvement in whole‐body
insulin sensitivity after AET is not linked to an impaired increase in
skeletal muscle insulin signaling at AKT.
We also evaluated skeletal muscle protein translation and associ-
ated regulatory proteins. The tendency to increase the phosphoryla-
tion of 4eBP1 may indicate an increased signal to initiate translation
of mRNA into functional proteins 48 hr after the last bout of AET.
Intriguingly, we also demonstrated a trend for an interaction for
increased phosphorylation of RpS6 after aerobic exercise when tak-
ing metformin. RpS6 is controlled via the mTOR pathway and a reg-
ulator of ribosome biogenesis. We anticipated that metformin would
have blunted the exercise‐induced phosphorylation of RpS6 as previ-
ously shown with treatments that activate energetic stress signaling
pathways, such as caloric restriction (Miller, Robinson, Bruss, Heller-
stein, & Hamilton, 2012) or metformin (Kulkarni et al., 2018). Met-
formin did not significantly alter cumulative mitochondrial protein
synthesis rates that occurred during the last 4 weeks of the 12‐week
AET. We chose this period to measure because we reasoned that
subjects would have reached a steady‐state response to the exercise
and metformin. Because of the difference in respiratory function,
these data indicate that either a difference in mitochondrial remodel-
ing occurred in the first 8 weeks that we did not capture, or that
metformin has a direct effect on the mitochondria independent of
mitochondrial remodeling. The latter is consistent with our findings
that suggest metformin alters mitochondrial intrinsic function rather
than mitochondrial protein synthesis.

Limitations
While our study sought to address the influence of metformin on
exercise‐induced physiological and mitochondrial adaptations, one
potential limitation is that we did not include a metformin group
alone and relied on previous studies who have already tested the

 influence of metformin on insulin sensitivity and/or CRF (Konopka
et al., 2016; Malin et al., 2012; Sharoff et al., 2010). Further, our
study did not include a hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamp as the
gold standard approach of measuring peripheral insulin sensitivity.
However, our data using OGTT‐derived estimates of insulin sensitiv-
ity are in line with previous studies who have demonstrated that
metformin blunts the improvement in insulin sensitivity after exer-
cise (Malin et al., 2012; Sharoff et al., 2010). Future studies may also
include additional groups across a continuum of metabolic health
such as individuals who are insulin‐sensitive, insulin‐resistant, and
newly diagnosed T2DM.

Considerations for metformin as a treatment
to target aging
The results of the current study should be considered in the larger
context of proposed treatments to slow aging. Retrospective data
and trials in populations with T2DM have shown improved overall
survival with metformin (Bannister et al., 2014), as well as decreased
risk of cardiovascular disease (UKPDS Group, 1998), cancer inci-
dence (Wu, Boudreau, Park, Simonds, & Freedman, 2014), and cogni-
tive decline (Cheng et al., 2014). Although these studies support the
use of metformin as a potential healthspan extending treatment,
these findings were largely in subjects with T2DM and none were in
adults absent of disease. For metformin to successfully target and
delay aging, it should (a) decrease age‐related diseases in general,
rather than only the decreased incidence of a single disease (i.e.,
T2DM), (b) be effective at reducing the onset of age‐related diseases
in most, if not all populations, rather than just those with hyper-
glycemia and T2DM, and (c) prevent or delay the deleterious effects
of aging before the accumulation of age‐related morbidities. Our
study is important in that it shows metformin can have positive or
negative effects on physiological function in those at risk, but absent
of chronic disease. The findings lead to questions about whether
metformin should be used as an adjunct to an exercise program or
in those who are already physically active and have high CRF. In
addition, they highlight the need to further explore the effects of
metformin in healthy individuals prior to widespread use as a slowed
aging treatment.

CONCLUSION
In summary, our findings show that metformin inhibits the increase
in skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration after 12 weeks of mod-
erate to vigorous AET despite no differences between placebo and
metformin on mitochondrial protein synthesis. Metformin also atten-
uated the increase in whole‐body insulin sensitivity and CRF after
AET. However, metformin did not inhibit other AET improvements,
including telomere elongation, fasting insulin, 24‐hr mean glucose,
and body composition. Our findings suggest that combining two
healthspan extending treatments, metformin and exercise, may inter-
fere with the improvement in some parameters of physiological
function and do not interact synergistically. This study indicates that
further research is needed before broadly prescribing metformin as a
treatment to slow aging.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Details of all study procedures and techniques can be found in the
Supporting Information. This study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board at Colorado State University (15‐5837H) and regis-
tered as a clinical trial (NCT02552355). Prior to beginning the study,
participants were informed of the study procedures, risks, and bene-
fits and then provided written consent.
5.1
|
Intervention
All participants completed a supervised, 12‐week AET program with
100% compliance. The AET included three sessions per week and
45 min per session. The first 15 min was at 60% of HR max while
the next 30 min was at a specified exercise intensity that progres-
sively increased 5% each week from 65% HRmax to 85% HRmax by
week 5. Participants had the option to exercise on a treadmill, sta-
tionary upright cycle ergometer, or an elliptical machine. Participants
were instructed to not change their normal diet. Immediately after
each exercise session, participants consumed a standardized bever-
age that consisted of carbohydrates (82 g) or carbohydrate (63 g)
plus protein (20 g). The original rationale for post‐exercise feeding
was to determine whether protein could stimulate skeletal muscle
mitochondrial protein synthesis as a way to offset the inhibitory
effects of metformin. Since there was minimal influence of post‐ex-
ercise nutrition on both clinical and cellular variables, these groups
were collapsed to focus on the effects of placebo vs. metformin.
Physical and clinical characteristics for those receiving different post‐
exercise feeding can be found in Supporting Information Table S1.
In a double‐blinded fashion, participants were randomized to
consume either placebo (lactose) or metformin. The dose for both
placebo and metformin was 500 mg/day the first week and increased
by 500 mg each week until reaching 2000 mg/day (1,000 mg twice
daily) by week 4. If participants weighed <75 kg, the maximum dose
was 1,500 mg/day (n = 5). Participants taking 1,500 mg/day were
instructed to consume 500 mg in the morning and 1,000 mg in the
evening. Participants were given more pills than needed on a weekly
basis during the first 4 weeks and every other week thereafter to
monitor pill compliance by the number of pills returned.
5.2

Oral glucose tolerance test
All participants arrived to the laboratory after an overnight fast. A
venous catheter was inserted to collect serial blood samples before
(−10 min) and after (0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min) con-
sumption of 75 g of glucose. Estimates of whole‐body insulin sensi-
tivity and glucose clearance were calculated using the Matsuda
Index (Matsuda & DeFronzo, 1999) and the oral glucose insulin sen-
sitivity (OGIS) index (Mari, Pacini, Murphy, Ludvik, & Nolan, 2001),
respectively.

Cardiorespiratory fitness
VO2max was determined on a stationary cycle ergometer (Lode), as
previously performed (Konopka et al. 2017; Robinson, Turner, Heller-
stein, Hamilton, & Miller, 2011). The workload began at 50 Watts
and increased every 2 min by 20 Watts for women and 30 Watts
for men. Respiratory gases were measured using a ParvoMedics
metabolic system.
5.4
|
Skeletal muscle biopsy
A muscle biopsy sample was obtained from the vastus lateralis
before and after the 12‐week intervention under local anesthesia
(1% lidocaine). Muscle bundles for high‐resolution respirometry were
immediately placed in ice‐cold BIOPS buffer while the remaining
muscle was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80C until pro-
cessed for analysis. Skeletal muscle data are unavailable for one par-
ticipant because no muscle sample was obtained.
5.5
|
Mitochondrial respiration
Permeabilization and respiration of muscle fibers were performed in
duplicate as previously performed (Konopka et al. 2017; Miller et al.,
2017). Respiration rates (O2 flux) were expressed relative to muscle
tissue wet weight (pmol/s/mg tissue).
5.6
|
Telomere length
Multiplexed qPCR measurements of telomere length were carried
out as previously described (Cawthon, 2009). Telomere length mea-
surements were performed using a Bio‐Rad CFX‐96 qPCR machine.
Multiplexing both telomere and albumin primers using a single fluo-
rescent DNA‐intercalating dye is possible because the telomere
sequences are amplified at a lower quantification cycle than the
albumin sequences. Standard curves were prepared using human
genomic DNA (Promega cat # G3041) with threefold dilutions rang-
ing from 50 to 0.617 ng. Negative controls included a no‐template
TelG/C only and AlbU/D only, and a combined TelG/C and AlbU/D
control. Samples were normalized across plates using a human geno-
mic DNA standard. Each sample was run in triplicate on a 96‐well
plate format, and relative telomere length was established using a
telomere (T)‐to‐albumin (A) ratio.
5.7
|
Deuterium labeling
Participants orally consumed deuterium oxide (2H2O, 70%, Sigma‐
Aldrich) to achieve an isotopic steady state of 1%–2% to label newly
synthesized skeletal muscle protein. 2H2O was provided during the
last 4 weeks of the intervention (weeks 9–12) starting with a priming
stage in week 9 (50 ml, 3×/day) followed by maintenance during
weeks 10–12 (50 ml, 2×/day). Body water enrichment was deter-
mined from plasma collected at the time of the OGTT. Tissue and
analyte preparation are detailed in the Supporting Information.
5.8
|
Western blotting
The cytoplasmic muscle fraction was used for western blot analysis.
15 µg of protein was loaded on the gel, and proteins were trans-
ferred onto PVDF membrane. Kaleidoscope (Bio‐Rad) was used as a
molecular weight marker. Blots were incubated overnight with the
primary antibodies found in the Supporting Information. Blots were
then washed with TBST (3 × 5 min), incubated with anti‐rabbit,
HRP‐conjugated secondary antibody, washed with TBST (3 × 5 min)
and TBS (2 × 5 min) and detected via chemiluminescence (West
Femto, Thermo Scientific). Images were obtained with a UVP
bioimaging system, and densitometry was analyzed using Image Stu-
dio Lite (version 5.2; Licor).

Statistics
Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM), and
a significance was set a priori at p < 0.05. Normality was confirmed
by the D'Agostino and Pearson test. A two‐way ANOVA (treatment
group × time) with repeated measures for time was performed.
Upon a significant effect, a Holm–Sidak's post hoc test was used for
multiple comparisons. When comparing the change (Δ) from pre‐ to
postintervention between groups, data were analyzed using an
unpaired t test. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) was used to
determine
associations
between dependent variables. GraphPad
Prism 7.0 was used to create figures and perform statistical analysis.
