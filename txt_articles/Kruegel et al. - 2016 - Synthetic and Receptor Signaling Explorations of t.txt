Abstract
Mu-opioid receptor agonists represent mainstays of pain management. However, the therapeutic 
use of these agents is associated with serious side effects, including potentially lethal respiratory 
depression. Accordingly, there is a longstanding interest in the development of new opioid 
analgesics with improved therapeutic profiles. The alkaloids of the Southeast Asian plant 
Mitragyna speciosa, represented by the prototypical member mitragynine, are an unusual class of 
opioid receptor modulators with distinct pharmacological properties. Here we describe the first 
receptor-level functional characterization of mitragynine and related natural alkaloids at the mu-, 
kappa-, and delta-opioid receptors. These results show that mitragynine and the oxidized analog 7-
hydroxymitragynine, are partial agonists of the human mu-opioid receptor and competitive 
antagonists at the kappa- and delta-opioid receptors. We also show that mitragynine and 7-
hydroxymitragynine are G-protein-biased agonists of the mu-opioid receptor, which do not recruit 
β-arrestin following receptor activation. Therefore, the Mitragyna alkaloid scaffold represents a 
novel framework for the development of functionally biased opioid modulators, which may exhibit 
improved therapeutic profiles. Also presented is an enantioselective total synthesis of both (-)-

 mitragynine and its unnatural enantiomer, (+)-mitragynine, employing a proline-catalyzed 
Mannich-Michael reaction sequence as the key transformation. Pharmacological evaluation of (+)-
mitragynine revealed its much weaker opioid activity. Likewise, the intermediates and chemical 
transformations developed in the total synthesis allowed the elucidation of previously unexplored 
structure-activity relationships (SAR) within the Mitragyna scaffold. Molecular docking studies, in 
combination with the observed chemical SAR, suggest that Mitragyna alkaloids adopt a binding 
pose at the mu-opioid receptor that is distinct from that of classical opioids.
Graphical Abstract
Introduction
The opioid receptors, and in particular, the mu-opioid receptor (MOR), are among the 
longest and most intensely studied molecular signaling systems in the central nervous 
system.1 Likewise, the prototypical small molecule agonist of these receptors, morphine, has 
been used by humans as an important analgesic and recreational euphoriant since ancient 
times. Indeed, MOR agonists, including not only morphine itself, but also a vast number of 
synthetic and semi-synthetic opioids, remain the gold standard of pain therapy. 
Unfortunately, acute MOR activation is also associated with serious side effects, including 
respiratory depression, constipation, sedation, nausea, and itching.1,2 At sufficiently high 
doses, the evoked respiratory depression can be severe enough to cause death. Further, the 
pronounced euphoria produced by MOR agonists makes them major drugs of abuse. These 
properties have made overdose from prescription opioid analgesics a leading cause of 
accidental death in the United States, killing more than 18,000 people in 2014.3,4 Another 
shortcoming of MOR agonists is the rapid development of tolerance to their analgesic 
effects. Thus, continuing escalation of dose is required to maintain an equivalent level of 
pain management. Similarly, when they are abused, tolerance to the euphoric effects of 
opioids is also rapidly developed. Thus in either case, chronic use often results in severe 
physical dependence on MOR agonists due to cellular- and circuit-level adaptations to 
continuous receptor stimulation. Accordingly, much effort has been dedicated to the 
development of new MOR agonists retaining potent analgesic effects, while mitigating or 
eliminating the deleterious side effects of the agents currently in use.1–8
Historically, MOR agonists have also been applied in the treatment of mood disorders, 
notably including major depressive disorder (MDD). Indeed, until the mid-20th century, low 
doses of opium itself were used to treat depression, and the so called “opium cure” was 
purportedly quite effective.9 With the advent of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) in the 
1950s however, the psychiatric use of opioids rapidly fell out of favor and has been largely

 dormant since, likely due to negative medical and societal perceptions stemming from their 
abuse potential. However, there have been scattered clinical reports (both case studies and 
small controlled trials) since the 1970s indicating the effectiveness of MOR agonists in 
treating depression. The endogenous opioid peptide β-endorphin, as well as a number of 
small molecules, have all been reported to rapidly and robustly improve the symptoms of 
MDD and/or anxiety disorders in the clinical setting, even in treatment resistant 
patients.10–17 These results have been recapitulated in rodent models, where a variety of 
MOR agonists show antidepressant effects.18–21 Most recently, we have found that the 
atypical antidepressant tianeptine, which has been used clinically for several decades and 
extensively studied in rodents and other mammalian species, is an MOR agonist, suggesting 
that this agent exerts its antidepressant effects via direct MOR activation.22 When taken 
together, this body of work establishes a clear precedent for the effectiveness of MOR 
agonists in the treatment of depression and anxiety. Unfortunately, the treatment of mood 
disorders with conventional MOR agonists is expected to suffer from the same liabilities as 
their use in the context of pain management. Accordingly, our laboratories have been 
concerned with the exploration of structurally and pharmacologically distinct classes of 
MOR agonists, with the aim of developing new opioid-based treatments for mood disorders 
and pain, which lack the classical side effects of these agents.
It was in this context that we became interested in the psychoactive plant Mitragyna speciosa 
(Figure 1), known as “kratom” in Thailand, or “biak biak” in Malaysia, a substance which 
has been used by humans in Southeast Asia for centuries to treat a variety of ailments. The 
plant material is typically consumed as a tea or chewed directly. At low doses, kratom is 
primarily used for its stimulating effects. At higher doses, opioid-like effects predominate, 
and the plant has been used as a general analgesic and as a substitute for opium or to treat 
opium withdrawal symptoms. Other medicinal applications are also known, including use as 
a treatment for fever, cough, diarrhea, and depression. There is also a precedent for 
recreational use of the plant, a fact that has contributed to legal control of Mitragyna 
speciosa in both Thailand and Malaysia, but the plant remains uncontrolled outside its 
endemic regions.23–27
In light of its well documented medicinal properties, the molecular constituents of 
Mitragyna speciosa responsible for its psychoactive effects have been studied, with more 
than 20 unique indole alkaloids having been identified in the plant.23–25,28 The indole 
alkaloid mitragynine (Figure 1) has been universally cited as the primary alkaloid 
constituent of Mitragyna speciosa, accounting for up to 66% by mass of crude alkaloid 
extracts.23 The other major alkaloids in the plant have been found to include paynantheine, 
speciogynine, and speciociliatine (Figure 1).23 The quantities of these major alkaloids, along 
with a wide variety of minor alkaloids, are considerably varied amongst different regional 
varieties of the plant and also depend on plant age, facts that considerably complicate the 
interpretation of reported psychoactive effects from the raw plant material.23–25,28 Amongst 
the minor alkaloids, the oxidized derivative 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH)29 (Figure 1) is of 
particular interest, as it has been reported to induce analgesic effects mediated through 
agonist activity at the mu-opioid receptor (MOR), exceeding in potency those of the 
prototypical opioid agonist morphine.27,30

 The mechanism of action of Mitragyna alkaloids has also been studied both in vitro and in 
vivo. In particular, Takayama and coworkers have accumulated a large body of evidence 
implicating the opioid receptor system as the primary mediator of the psychoactive effects of 
these alkaloids. Specifically, both mitragynine and 7-OH exhibit nanomolar binding 
affinities for the MOR and possess functional activity in tissue assays.27,30 Likewise, the 
antinociceptive effects of mitragynine and 7-OH in several rodent models are also inhibited 
by naloxone.27,30,31 Despite this evidence for the involvement of opioid receptor systems, 
and specifically MOR, in mediating the analgesic effects of Mitragyna alkaloids, there are 
conflicting reports in the literature. Most notably, an early study with mitragynine indicated 
that the behavioral effects in cats, and analgesic effects in rats, were not reversed by 
treatment with nalorphine, an opioid antagonist, while at the same time, mitragynine was 
found to produce markedly less respiratory depression than codeine.32 Mitragynine has been 
shown to bind in some degree to several non-opioid CNS receptors, including alpha-2 
adrenergic receptor (α2R), adenosine A2a, dopamine D2, and the serotonin receptors 5-HT2C 
and 5-HT7, but the strength of these affinities has not been reported.33 Mitragynine analgesia 
has also been shown to be inhibited by α2R antagonist idazoxan and by the non-specific 
serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine.34
Considering the many possible confounding factors present at the tissue or system level, 
such in vivo and ex vivo tissue assays are not ideal for positive confirmation of a functional 
effect at a particular receptor. Although receptor-level functional activity studies 
([35S]GTPγS binding) using cloned opioid receptors have recently been reported for several 
synthetic oxidized analogs35, no similar functional studies have been reported for 
mitragynine itself, or for other naturally occurring alkaloids in Mitragyna speciosa.36 Given 
the unique and still unclear molecular pharmacology surrounding Mitragyna alkaloids, we 
undertook a thorough examination of mitragynine and a number of natural and novel analogs 
at the opioid receptors, measuring receptor activation and intracellular signaling.
Results and Discussion
Mitragynine is a Partial Agonist of Human MOR
We isolated the four major alkaloids (Figure 1) from the Thai strain of Mitragyna speciosa 
and prepared 7-OH by photochemical oxidation of mitragynine (Scheme S1). Interestingly, 
only trace quantities of 7-OH were observed (by mass spectrometry) in our extractions of the 
raw plant material, and it was not possible to isolate any measurable quantity of this 
derivative. Therefore, it is doubtful that this alkaloid is a universal constituent of all 
Mitragyna speciosa preparations, and is unlikely to generally account for the psychoactive 
properties of this plant.
We then set out to evaluate the activity of these compounds in HEK cells expressing the 
MOR, delta-opioid receptor (DOR), or kappa-opioid receptor (KOR), using bioluminescence 
resonance energy transfer (BRET) functional assays. In these G protein-dependent assays, 
the Gα subunit is fused with a luciferase (RLuc8) donor, and the Gγ subunit is fused with a 
fluorescent protein (mVenus) acceptor. Thus, on receptor activation, the G protein subunits 
move apart and the observed BRET signal decreases (Figure 2A).

 At the human opioid receptors (hMOR, hKOR, and hDOR), mitragynine acted as a partial 
agonist at hMOR (Table 1 and Figure 2B, EC50 = 339 ± 178 nM; maximal efficacy (Emax) = 
34%). This result represents the first demonstration of functional opioid agonist activity at 
human receptors with a natural Mitragyna alkaloid, all prior functional studies having been 
conducted in vivo in rodents or ex vivo in rodent tissue. In contrast, at hKOR, mitragynine 
was a competitive antagonist (Table 1, IC50 = 8.5 ± 7.6 µM; pA2 = 1.4 ± 0.40 µM, and 
Figure S2 and S4), fully inhibiting the activity of the reference agonist U-50,488. Similarly, 
mitragynine acted as an antagonist at hDOR, but with very low potency (Figure S3). The 
other major natural alkaloids paynantheine, speciogynine, and speciociliatine, showed no 
measurable agonist activity at any of the human opioid receptors at concentrations up to 100 
µM, and only weak antagonist effects were observed (Table 1 and Figures S1, S2, and S3). 
The oxidized analog, 7-OH, was also characterized and found to be a potent, partial agonist 
at hMOR (Table 1 and Figure 2B, EC50 = 34.5 ± 4.5 nM; Emax = 47%). Further, it acted as a 
competitive antagonist at both hKOR (Table 1, IC50 = 7.9 ± 3.7 µM; pA2 = 490 ± 131 nM, 
and Figures S2 and S5) and hDOR (Table 1, IC50 = 15.6 ± 9.1 µM, and Figure S3). The 
partial agonist activity of mitragynine and 7-OH at the human receptors was further 
confirmed in antagonist experiments, as both compounds were able to partially inhibit the 
response elicited by the full agonist [D-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly-ol5]-enkephalin (DAMGO) 
(Figure S1).
In order to further confirm the opioid activity of the Mitragyna alkaloids, we performed 
radioligand binding studies to assess the affinity of the natural alkaloids and 7-OH for the 
opioid receptors (Table 2). As expected from their activity in our functional assays, both 
mitragynine and 7-OH exhibited significant binding affinities for hMOR. Similarly, the other 
natural alkaloids also bound to hMOR, consistent with their antagonist activity in the 
functional assays. Binding was also observed for mitragynine and 7-OH at hKOR and 
hDOR, again in agreement with the results of the functional assays. Further, the Ki values 
determined in the binding experiments were in accord with the EC50 and IC50 (after 
correction by Cheng-Prusoff equation) values determined in the functional experiments, or 
with the pA2 values (an estimate of Kd) determined by Schild analysis. Similar binding 
results were also obtained at the mouse opioid receptors (Table S2). Further, our binding 
data with 7-OH was consistent with previous literature reports (using guinea pig brain 
homogenates), but the affinities determined for mitragynine at MOR and DOR were much 
weaker than previously described.27,30 Given the better agreement between our in vitro data 
and the relative potencies of mitragynine and 7-OH in vivo, this new data may be more 
reliable. Taken together, the functional and binding results provide a rigorous and internally 
consistent assessment of the in vitro activity of the Mitragyna alkaloids at all three human 
opioid receptors.
Surprisingly, analogous assays using rodent receptors (mouse or rat) revealed that 
mitragynine exhibited no agonist activity, and it was instead found to act as a competitive 
antagonist at mouse MOR (mMOR) (Figure S6 and Table S1, IC50 = 1.1 µM; pA2 = 807 
± 573 nM), fully inhibiting the activation induced by the reference agonist DAMGO. The 
other isolated natural products, paynantheine, speciogynine, and speciociliatine, showed no 
notable agonist or antagonist activity at any of the rodent opioid receptors. In contrast, the 
activity of 7-OH was similar at the rodent receptors (Figure S6 and Table S1). These

 observations complicate the interpretation of prior reports of analgesic effects elicited by 
mitragynine in rodent models. Further, this interspecies variation may present significant 
challenges in the development of compounds in this class as novel therapeutics, as activity in 
rodent models may not be easily translatable to man. In this regard, it is fortunate that the 
more potent derivative, 7-OH, retains its agonist activity at mMOR, as the oxidized scaffold 
represents a more promising starting point for the development of analgesics in this class. 
With respect to mitragynine, it is also conceivable that the in vitro assays used in our study 
do not exactly replicate the receptor activation and signaling in native murine brain tissue. 
For example, a low efficacy partial agonist in the brain may appear as an antagonist (i.e. 
agonist with 0% efficacy) in the cell-based assays. Thus, consideration of both interspecies 
and interassay variability is advised for the future development of these compounds.
Mitragyna Alkaloids Bias Intracellular Signaling Toward G Proteins
Functionally selective (biased) agonists of the opioid receptors, which preferentially activate 
only certain downstream signaling pathways, hold promise as analgesics or antidepressants 
with reduced side effects. Given this potential to separate the well established therapeutic 
benefits of MOR activation from negative side effects, the study of functionally selective 
MOR ligands is a very active area of research at present.41–44 In particular, some evidence 
indicates that MOR agonists biased toward G protein signaling over β-arrestin signaling 
display less respiratory depression, tolerance development, and constipation, while 
remaining potent analgesics.45–48 Therefore, we were interested in exploring the potential 
for mitragynine’s unique molecular scaffold to serve as a starting point for the development 
of biased MOR agonists. To assess the level of β-arrestin recruitment induced by Mitragyna 
alkaloids, we employed a recently described BRET assay in transfected HEK cells, which 
was adapted for use with the opioid receptors.49 In this assay, the unlabeled receptor (in this 
case hMOR) is transfected alongside β-arrestin-2 (arrestin-3), fused with luciferase (RLuc8) 
and an SH3 binding domain (Sp1), and the membrane protein GAP43, fused with a 
fluorescent protein (citrine) and an SH3 domain. Accordingly, when an agonist induces β-
arrestin recruitment to MOR, the Sp1 domain on β-arrestin is brought into proximity with 
the membrane-localized SH3 domain, and binding occurs. This results in concomitant 
association of the luciferase donor and fluorescent protein acceptor, and a BRET signal is 
observed (Figure 3A). An advantage of this format is that native receptor can be used, 
avoiding potential confounds related to C-terminal tagging on expression or function.
As measured in this cell signaling assay, DAMGO induced robust recruitment of β-arrestin. 
Interestingly, both mitragynine and 7-OH were found to elicit no measurable β-arrestin 
binding, even in the presence of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), which 
typically enhances coupling to β-arrestin (Figure 3B). Due to this extremely weak signal, we 
were not able to quantitate the magnitude of functional selectivity for mitragynine and 7-
OH. However, since both compounds exhibit significant efficacy for activation in the G 
protein dissociation assay (Figure 2), there is a strong qualitative bias in favor of G protein 
signaling in these cells. Such selectivity for G protein-dependent signaling may explain the 
reduced respiratory depression previously reported for mitragynine compared to codeine32, 
although any such connection between upstream receptor signaling and physiological 
properties must be considered speculative. In any case, both mitragynine and 7-OH trigger

 downstream signaling significantly different from that induced by DAMGO. These results 
provide a good rationale for future experiments aimed at examining cellular signaling in 
relevant neuronal cells and mapping the effects of structural modifications on the level of 
functional selectivity.
SAR Exploration: Strategy
Having confirmed the MOR agonist activity of both mitragynine and 7-OH, we chose to 
explore several key structure-activity relationships (SAR) within this scaffold. In particular, 
we were interested in the effects of modifications at three positions: the methoxy group at 
position 9, the ethyl group on ring D, and the β-methoxyacrylate moiety (Figure 4). The aryl 
methoxy group at position 9 was of particular interest, as in the classical morphinan and 
benzomorphan opioid scaffolds, the change from aryl methoxy to phenol at key position 3 
(e.g. codeine to morphine), results in a dramatic increase in potency. Likewise, unsubstituted 
phenyl analogs in these scaffolds also exhibit weak activity.51 The importance of a phenolic 
moiety in many known MOR ligands is proposed to be due to formation of a water-mediated 
hydrogen bonding network with H2976.52 (superscript numbers refer to Ballesteros and 
Weinstein’s generic numbering scheme52), as shown in two recent X-ray crystal structures 
of MOR.37,53 Accordingly, it was hypothesized that if mitragynine binds in a similar pose, 
then the corresponding desmethyl analog 1 (Figure 4) would be expected to exhibit 
significantly increased potency. We also envisioned simplification of the D ring substituents 
by selective deletion of the enol ether (2) or pendant ethyl group (3) (Figure 4), analogs 
which would probe previously unexplored SAR in this region.
Enantioselective Total Synthesis of Mitragynine and Analogs
Although 7-OH and the desmethyl derivative 1 were prepared from the isolated natural 
product (Scheme S1), we also desired a total synthesis of mitragynine that would allow for 
the construction of more extensively modified analogs. Accordingly, we envisioned a 
synthesis starting from 4-methoxyindole, where ring C could be installed via Bischler-
Napieralski reaction to give a 3,4-dihydro-β-carboline. This intermediate would then be 
subjected to an enantioselective, proline-catalyzed Mannich-Michael-type cyclization with 
the appropriate enone to install ring D and set the stereocenter at position 3. This 
transformation was developed by Itoh and coworkers, and has been successfully employed in 
the total synthesis of several structurally similar indole alkaloids.54–56 The resulting 
tetracyclic ketone would serve as a versatile intermediate for the synthesis of a variety of 
analogs, including mitragynine itself (Figure 5).
The required 3,4-dihydro-β-carboline (4) was successfully prepared in a six step sequence 
starting from commercially available 4-methoxyindole (21% overall yield, Scheme S2A). 
The required enone (5) was synthesized from methyl 2-ethyl-3-oxobutanoate according to 
previously described procedures (Scheme S2B).57
With the necessary building blocks in hand, we attempted the key proline-mediated step for 
formation of ring D. Initial experiments with crude β-carboline 4 treated with an excess of 
enone 5 in the presence of proline, afforded the desired ketones in moderate yield as a 
mixture of epimers 6 and 7. Importantly, we found that the major diastereomer 6 was

 obtained in high enantiomeric excess (ee), while the minor diastereomer 7 was obtained in 
much lower ee. After optimization of the reaction conditions (it proved crucial to purify the 
β-carboline by chromatography), the desired ketone isomer 6S could be obtained in good 
yield and excellent enantiomeric excess (Scheme 1A). To rationalize the stereoselectivity of 
this transformation, a two step mechanism (Scheme 1B, D-proline shown) can be imagined, 
in which a Mannich-like reaction between the proline enamine of enone 5 and the β-
carboline 4, first sets the stereocenter at position 3. This is followed by intramolecular 
Michael addition to close the ring. In the last step, proline controls the face of protonation 
during hydrolysis, thereby also influencing the stereocenter at position 19. Proline is 
believed to be involved in control of the stereochemistry at the 19-position, as the 
diastereomeric ratio obtained in the reaction varies, and is different from that observed when 
either ketone product (6 or 7) is epimerized under basic conditions. Thus, the orientation of 
this stereocenter is not due simply to thermodynamic equilibration of the ketone product.
With key intermediate ketone 6S in hand, the next challenge of the synthesis was to effect 
epimerization of the pendant ethyl group into the appropriate β stereochemical configuration 
(as in mitragynine). This could not be accomplished by thermodynamic equilibration of the 
ketone with base or acid, as the desired stereochemistry positions the ethyl group in the less 
favorable axial configuration. As an alternative strategy, we envisioned that pseudo-allylic 
strain in the ene-ester product of a Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons (HWE) reaction, or in the 
corresponding transition state, might be used to perturb the equilibrium away from the 
equatorial alignment.58 Therefore, ketone 6S was treated with the carbanion formed from 
methyl diethylphosphonoacetate, and partial epimerization was indeed observed (Scheme 
2A). The ene-ester with the desired axial ethyl group was obtained as a mixture of E and Z 
isomers, 8E and 8Z (55 mol% of total product by NMR), while the ene-ester with retention 
of configuration at the ethyl group, 9, was obtained exclusively as the E isomer (45 mol% of 
total product by NMR). Unfortunately, the low reactivity of ketone 6S necessitated the use 
of large excesses of phosphonoaceate, a requirement that led to partial transesterification of 
the methyl ester (products 8 and 9 contained ~25 mol% of the corresponding ethyl ester).
With the ethyl group successfully epimerized to the appropriate position, the mixed ene-
esters 8E/Z were converted to (-)-mitragynine by a sequence of several key steps, including 
the simultaneous reduction of the ene-ester and detosylation with magnesium, 
transesterification, Claisen condensation (formylation), and O-methylation59 of the enol-
ester intermediate 10 (Scheme 2A). The final O-methylation step provided both (-)-
mitragynine and the isomeric analog (Z)-mitragynine (11) in modest yields. Starting from 
ketone 6R and employing the same synthetic sequence, the unnatural enantiomer, (+)-
mitragynine, was also obtained (Scheme 2B). Comparison of this material to the natural 
product by chiral HPLC confirmed their opposite stereochemistry, and thus, the absolute 
stereochemistry of the ketone products 6 and 7 obtained in the proline-catalyzed cyclization.
Synthesis of Desethylmitragynine
Considering that speciogynine, which is epimeric with mitragynine at the pendant ethyl 
group on ring D, was inactive as an opioid agonist in vitro, we reasoned that the nature and 
orientation of the substituent at this position was important for activity, and thus decided to

 further define the tolerance of the scaffold in this region via synthesis of the 
desethylmitragynine analog 3 (Figure 4). This dramatically modified analog was prepared by 
a synthetic sequence analogous to that applied for the synthesis of mitragynine, starting with 
the treatment of β-carboline 4 with methyl vinyl ketone in the presence of D-proline 
(Scheme S3).
Opioid Activity of Synthetic Analogs
With a variety of semi- and fully synthetic mitragynine derivatives in hand, key SAR of this 
molecular scaffold at the opioid receptors could be further explored. In particular, the 
synthesized analogs allowed investigation of the key moieties highlighted above, namely the 
aryl methoxy group at position 9, the β-methoxyacrylate moiety, and the ethyl group on ring 
D (see above, SAR Exploration: Strategy), as well as the importance of the absolute 
stereochemistry. As expected, the unnatural enantiomer (+)-mitragynine was found be a 
much weaker agonist at hMOR, in terms of both potency and maximal efficacy (Table 3). 
Surprisingly however, in contrast to naturally occurring (-)-mitragynine, it was found to be a 
low potency partial agonist at hKOR (EC50 = 9.1 ± 4.3 µM; Emax = 31%). Apparently, 
inversion of the stereochemistry in this scaffold is sufficient to switch from antagonist to 
agonist activity at hKOR.
In examining the specific functional groups identified above (Figure 4), we observed several 
important trends. For one, the switch from a methoxy group to a hydroxy group at position 9 
had very little effect on activity at hMOR, with the phenolic analog 1 being of similar 
potency and efficacy to mitragynine itself (Table 3). This result suggests that the mitragynine 
scaffold is likely to adopt a unique binding pose compared to classical morphinan- and 
benzomorphan-derived opioids, which display a dramatic relationship between their MOR 
activity and an exposed phenol group. Moving to the β-methoxyacrylate moiety, removal of 
the enol ether, as in the total synthesis intermediate 2, completely eliminated activity at 
hMOR (both agonist and antagonist). In contrast, the very close analog (Z)-mitragynine 
(11), was found to possess very similar activity to the natural product, indicating that 
stereochemical inversion of the β-methoxyacrylate moiety is tolerated (Table 3). Lastly, we 
turned our attention to the ethyl group on ring D. Results with speciogynine (Table 1) had 
already demonstrated that epimerization of this group was sufficient to switch from agonist 
to antagonist activity at hMOR, while also reducing binding affinity (see above, Tables 1 and 
2, mitragynine vs. speciogynine). Examining the desethylmitragynine analog 3, we found 
that this derivative retained agonist activity at hMOR, but with much lower potency (Table 
3). Thus, the substituent at position 19 is important for controlling both efficacy (agonist vs. 
antagonist) and potency. The synthetic derivatives described here ((+)-mitragynine, 1, 2, 3, 
and 11) were also found to be without activity at hKOR and hDOR (agonist and antagonist 
mode, EC50 and IC50 both >30 µM).
Molecular Docking Reveals a Unique Binding Pose
In order to rationalize our empirical SAR observations in the mitragynine scaffold and 
inform future rational design, we conducted preliminary molecular docking studies. 
Specifically, AutoDock60 was used to dock mitragynine and several of the analogs described

 above in the binding pocket of the agonist-bound X-ray crystal structure of mMOR (PDBID 
= 5C1M)37 (Figure 6).
The top-scored binding pose of (-)-mitragynine in the orthosteric site of the receptor 
partially overlapped with the binding pose of the co-crystallized morphinan-derived agonist, 
BU72, but exhibited some dramatic differences (compare Figure 6A to Figure S7). Although 
(-)-mitragynine and BU72 share a polar interaction between their protonated amines and 
D1473.32, which is well known to be critical for the binding of classical opioid agonists and 
antagonists37,53, other important ligand-receptor contacts are significantly different. In 
BU72 (Figure S7), the phenol occupies a hydrophobic pocket formed by TM5 and TM6 and 
forms a water-mediated hydrogen bonding network with H2976.52, an interaction that is 
common to opioid ligands in the morphinan class (see above for discussion, SAR 
Exploration: Strategy).36,51,53 In contrast, our docking studies suggest that the 
methoxyindole domain of (-)-mitragynine is preferentially directed toward an alternative 
hydrophobic pocket formed by residues of TM2 and TM3 (Figure 6A), which appears to 
lack a means for forming an analogous hydrogen bonding network. This result is in 
agreement with the minimal activity difference observed in vitro between (-)-mitragynine 
and phenolic derivative 1 (Table 3). Instead, the enol ether domain (part of the β-
methoxyacrylate) of mitragynine appears to be directed into the same region as the phenol of 
BU72 (toward TM5 and TM6). Thus, it can be speculated that this functional group 
participates in an analogous hydrogen bonding network with H2976.52, consistent with the 
complete loss of activity when this group was removed (see compound 2, Table 3).
The importance of the ethyl group on ring D is also explained by the predicted lowest-
energy binding pose of (-)-mitragynine. In comparing the orientation of this ligand with that 
of BU72 (Figure 6A and Figure S7, respectively), it can be seen that the ethyl group 
occupies a nearly identical region as the N-methyl group of BU72, being in the vicinity of 
several hydrophobic residues (M1513.36, Y1483.33, and Y3267.43). Accordingly, loss of this 
group, as in compound 3, would be expected to diminish hydrophobic ligand-receptor 
interactions and reduce activity, as was observed (Table 3).
Docking of other mitragynine analogs described above also produced results that were in 
agreement with the in vitro activity data. For example, in accord with its similar in vitro 
activity to (-)-mitragynine, (Z)-mitragynine (11) adopted a nearly identical binding pose 
(Figure 6B). Likewise, the predicted low-energy binding pose of 7-OH was also similar, with 
all key functionalities (the acrylate, ethyl group, tertiary amine, and indole) occupying very 
similar positions (Figure 6C). Interestingly, the 7-position hydroxy group does not appear to 
make a close contact with the receptor surface, and thus, potential hydrogen bonding 
interactions do not seem to be involved in the significant increase in potency afforded by 
oxidation at position 7. Instead, the slight bend introduced to the core structure by this 
modification appears to be more important. Notably, while (-)-mitragynine interacts with 
W2936.48 through its acrylate group, 7-OH interacts with this residue through both ethyl and 
acrylate groups, according to the chosen cutoff for apolar interactions (4.5 Å between heavy 
atoms; see Table S3). In contrast, docking of the unnatural enantiomer, (+)-mitragynine, 
revealed a dramatically different binding pose, reversed in its overall orientation in the

 pocket (i.e. with the acrylate projecting toward TM2 and TM3, see Figure S8A and compare 
with Figure 6A), in agreement with its weak activity in the functional assays.
We also docked paynantheine, speciogynine, and speciociliatine, compounds which bind to 
hMOR, but exhibit no agonist activity, instead serving as competitive antagonists. 
Considering paynantheine and speciogynine, the inverted stereochemistry at position 19 
(vinyl or ethyl group) induces a significant shift of the indole moiety toward TM1 and away 
from TM3 (Figure 6D), which results in the formation of additional contacts with TM1 
(Y751.39) and TM6 (H3197.36) that are not seen in the docking of the active compounds. 
Moreover, the hydrophobic interactions between the indole methoxy group and V1433.28 
and I1443.29 observed with (-)mitragynine are lost in these analogs, potentially resulting in 
reduced affinity for the active conformation of the receptor and corresponding antagonist 
activity. Consistent with the inverted stereochemistry of the core structure at position 3, 
docking of speciociliatine revealed a completely different binding pose with its indole group 
extending towards TM3 and forming a polar interaction with Y1483.33 (Figure S8B and 
Table S3). Notably, unlike all other compounds reported here, the acrylate moiety in 
speciociliatine is in axial rather than equatorial position, pointing towards TM5 and TM6. 
All in all, a number of different stereochemical configurations in the Mitragyna alkaloid 
family appear to be sufficient to retain binding at hMOR, while the absolute stereochemistry 
found in mitragynine is required for activation of the receptor.
Conclusion
In this work, we have presented the first thorough, in vitro characterization of the opioid 
receptor pharmacology and signaling of the natural Mitragyna alkaloids in receptor-level 
functional assays. The partial agonist activity of (-)-mitragynine at MOR is likely to account 
for many of the effects of Mitragyna speciosa extracts in humans. However, the other major 
alkaloids isolated from the plant, paynanthiene, speciogynine, and speciociliatine, all 
exhibited competitive antagonist activity at this receptor. Considering that cumulatively, 
these secondary alkaloids accounted for an approximately equal percentage of the total 
alkaloid content compared to mitragynine in our extracts, the gross psychoactive effects of 
crude plant material are likely to represent a complex interplay of competing agonist and 
antagonist effects at the opioid receptors. It was also found that the potent oxidized analog 7-
OH is not necessarily present in all extracts of plant material (as previously suggested), so 
the potential contribution of this alkaloid to the effects of Mitragyna speciosa is not general, 
unless 7-OH is formed as a metabolite.
Exploration with several synthetic mitragynine analogs allowed us to define basic SAR at 
each of the existing substituents, including in regions (the D ring) that were only accessible 
to derivatization via total synthesis. This work revealed that opioid activity in the 
mitragynine scaffold is quite sensitive to structural modification and suggested that the 
Mitragya alkaloids adopt a unique binding pose at MOR, distinct from that of classical 
opioids. This possibility was further supported by molecular docking studies at MOR. The 
first total synthesis of the unnatural enantiomer, (+)-mitragynine, likewise allowed us to 
confirm that the naturally occurring isomer is the more active opioid agonist.

 We also found that mitragynine and 7-OH display biased signaling at MOR, being selective 
for the G protein pathway. Thus, it is hoped that this scaffold may represent a starting point 
for the development of novel opioid analgesics with reduced side effects. Relatedly, the 
finding that, in addition to their activity at MOR, both mitragynine and 7-OH are KOR 
antagonists, suggests that Mitragyna alkaloids or their synthetic derivatives may also serve 
as leads for novel dual-action antidepressants. In this regard, mitragynine itself is of 
particular interest, as it acts as both a low efficacy MOR partial agonist, and a KOR 
antagonist. Both of these mechanisms have been shown to elicit antidepressant effects in 
animals, and in the case of MOR, humans as well (see above). However, modulators of the 
KOR have received considerably more attention in the psychiatry community in recent 
years, likely due to their apparent lack of abuse potential. Antagonists of this receptor are 
antidepressant in animal models and oppose a variety of stress-related responses that are 
believed to be mediated through the endogenous KOR agonists, dynorphins.61–63 Further, 
several agents in this class have entered clinical trials for MDD, but none have yet reached 
the market.64 Given the ability of mitragynine to perturb both of these opioid signaling 
systems in the direction consistent with mood enhancement, it is unsurprising that it has 
been shown to exhibit antidepressant activity in the forced swim test (a rodent model of 
depression).65 Therefore, Mitragyna alkaloids also hold promise in the treatment of mood 
disorders.
