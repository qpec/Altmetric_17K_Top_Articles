Aims
The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a femoral nerve block and a 
periarticular infiltration in the management of early post-operative pain after total knee 
arthroplasty (TKA).
Patients and Methods
A pragmatic, single centre, two arm parallel group, patient blinded, randomised controlled trial 
was undertaken. All patients due for TKA were eligible. Exclusion criteria included 
contraindications to the medications involved in the study and patients with a neurological 
abnormality of the lower limb. Patients received either a femoral nerve block with 75 mg of 
0.25% levobupivacaine hydrochloride around the nerve, or periarticular infiltration with 150 mg 
of 0.25% levobupivacaine hydrochloride, 10 mg morphine sulphate, 30 mg ketorolac 
trometamol and 0.25 mg of adrenaline all diluted with 0.9% saline to make a volume of 150 ml.
Results
A total of 264 patients were recruited and data from 230 (88%) were available for the primary 
analysis. Intention-to-treat analysis of the primary outcome measure of a visual analogue 
score for pain on the first post-operative day, prior to physiotherapy, was similar in both 
groups. The mean difference was -0.7 (95% confidence interval (CI) -5.9 to 4.5; p = 0.834). The 
periarticular group used less morphine in the first post-operative day compared with the 
femoral nerve block group (74%, 95% CI 55 to 99). The femoral nerve block group reported 39 
adverse events, of which 27 were serious, in 31 patients and the periarticular group reported 
51 adverse events, of which 38 were serious, in 42 patients up to six weeks post-operatively. 
None of the adverse events were directly attributed to either of the interventions under 
investigation.
Conclusion 
Periarticular infiltration is a viable and safe alternative to femoral nerve block for the early 
post-operative relief of pain following TKA.

About 93 000 total knee arthroplasties (TKAs)
were performed by surgeons in the NHS in the
United Kingdom in 2014; a 200% increase
since 2004.1 There may be severe pain in the
early post-operative period after this opera-
tion.2 A femoral nerve block, as a single rou-
tine 
peri-operative 
infiltration 
of 
local
anaesthetic, improves the control of pain and
reduces the need for systemic analgesics such
as opiates.2,3 However, it does not provide
analgesic effects to the posterior aspect of the
knee joint, which is supplied by the sciatic
nerve, and so pain relief is often incomplete. A
femoral nerve block may occasionally be asso-
ciated with serious complications, including
damage to the adjacent major blood vessels
and to the nerve itself.2 It also temporally
impairs quadriceps muscle function leading to
limited extension of the knee and falls post-
operatively.2,4 Alternative analgesic regimes
include an adductor canal block, but this also
does not provide analgesic effects to the back
of the knee.5
A popular alternative approach is the intra-
operative periarticular infiltration of analgesic
agents including local anaesthetics, opiates and
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which
may be delivered directly to the sources of
pain, reducing the risk of systemic side effects.6
Periarticular infiltration can be administered
by the operating surgeon without specialist
equipment, compared with a femoral nerve
block which requires ultrasound or a nerve
stimulator or both to be administered safely.

Periarticular infiltration does not inhibit quadriceps func-
tion and can provide analgesia to the whole of the knee
joint.2 However, there is little evidence to support its rou-
tine use in the management of early post-operative pain.2,7,8
We report a randomised controlled trial (RCT) compar-
ing the use of a femoral nerve block and periarticular infil-
tration in patients undergoing TKA to establish the most
effective management of early post-operative pain.
Patients and Methods
This was a single centre, two arm parallel group RCT
undertaken at the University Hospitals Coventry and War-
wickshire NHS Trust, Hospital of St. Cross, Rugby.
Patients were recruited between December 2013 and Octo-
ber 2015. All those undergoing primary unilateral TKA
were eligible. Exclusion criteria were:
- concomitant medical or psychiatric problems which
would interfere with treatment or follow-up;
- a neurological abnormality in the ipsilateral leg, e.g.
history of stroke, neurogenic pain or previous nerve pain;
- a specific contraindication to the analgesic agents used;
- participation in a clinical trial involving a pharmaceuti-
cal product during the previous 90 days;
- previous entry in the present trial;
- an inability to adhere to any procedure involved in the
trial.
Patients were allocated to treatment by a remote tele-
phone 1:1 randomisation service using a computer-
generated schedule with randomised blocks and stratified
by type of anaesthetic (general or spinal). The sizes of the
blocks were randomly chosen to ensure concealment. Ran-
domisation was undertaken by an independent member of
the operating theatre staff on the day of surgery after a spi-
nal anaesthetic with sedation or a general anaesthetic had
been administered.
All patients attended a routine pre-operative TKA educa-
tion class. Unless contraindicated, they were given gabapen-
tin as premedication and received either a spinal anaesthetic
with sedation or a general anaesthetic. After randomisation,
they were allocated to receive either femoral nerve block or
periarticular infiltration. The femoral nerve block technique
involved identification of the femoral nerve below the ingui-
nal ligament using nerve stimulation and/or ultrasound,
according to the anaesthetist’s normal practice, and infiltra-
tion of 75 mg of 0.25% levobupivacaine hydrochloride
around the nerve. Periarticular infiltration involved 150 mg
of 0.25% levobupivacaine hydrochloride, 10 mg morphine
sulphate, 30 mg ketorolac trometamol and 0.25 mg of
adrenaline, all diluted with 0.9% saline to make a volume of
150 ml. This was infiltrated into the skin and soft tissues of
the knee by the surgeon. The zones of infiltration included
the medial, lateral, suprapatellar and posterior soft tissues.
Surgeons were advised to infiltrate roughly equal quantities
to all four zones.
The remainder of the operation was performed accord-
ing to the surgeons’ routine practice. All patients followed
the same routine post-operative pathway unless they had
specific contraindications. All received regular paraceta-
mol, ibuprofen and gabapentin and morphine sulphate sus-
tained release. Oramorph was administered as required.
Routine thromboprophylaxis included intermittent positive
pressure calf compression until mobile and subcutaneous
low molecular heparin for 14 days post-operatively.
The fidelity with which both interventions were deliv-
ered was reviewed by an independent clinician (TC). The
results were relayed to those delivering the interventions in
order to maintain compliance with the protocol.
The primary outcome measure was a 100 visual analogue
score (VAS) of pain reported by the patient on the first day
post-operatively and before the start of physiotherapy, with
0 being no pain and 100 being the worst pain. This has been
validated for the assessment of pain after TKA.8 The primary
endpoint was chosen after feedback from the patient indicat-
ing adequate pain relief on the first post-operative day prior
to physiotherapy, and was of principal importance to the
study population; this is consistent with other smaller RCTs
which have also used this time point.9-11 
The secondary outcome measures are described below.
Pain after physiotherapy on the first post-operative day and
pain before and after physiotherapy on the second post-
operative day, was assessed using the same VAS as the pri-
mary outcome. Functional assessment was carried out by a
physiotherapist using straight leg raise and range of move-
ment of the knee, and the ability to transfer from bed to
chair and the time taken to rise from a chair, walk 3 m, turn
around, walk back to the chair, and sit down (timed up and
go).12 Total opiate, paracetamol, ibuprofen and gabapentin
analgesia used up to 24 and 48 hours post-operatively were
recorded. All opiates were converted to a morphine equiv-
alent dose using a multiplication conversion factor of 0.1
for codeine and tramadol, as outlined in the British
National Formulary.13 The Oxford Knee Score (OKS),14
EuroQol (EQ-5D-5L),15-17 and Douleur Neuropathic Pain
(DN2) score18,19 were taken six weeks post-operatively.
The OKS is a validated self-administered outcome meas-
ure.14 The EQ-5D-5L is a validated measure of health-
related quality of life, consisting of five dimensions and a
separate VAS.15,16 The values were calculated using the 3L
crosswalk value sets.17 The DN2 assesses neuropathic pain
using two questions.18,19 Adverse events (AEs) up to six
weeks post-operatively were recorded. An AE was defined
as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient, which
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the
treatment. They were further classified into serious adverse
events (SAEs) if they fulfilled any of the following criteria:
were immediately life-threatening, required hospitalisation
or prolongation of the existing hospitalisation, resulted in
persistent or significant disability or incapacity or
were regarded by the study team as an important medical
condition.
Although not reported in this study, patients were fol-
lowed up at up to 12 months with OKS, EQ-5D-5L, DN2

and AEs being recorded.20 These additional data are being
used to help inform the design of a further trial examining
chronic pain after TKA.
Patients were blind to the intervention to which they
were allocated. Concealment was maintained by ensuring
randomisation was performed after spinal anaesthesia and
sedation or general anaesthesia and then administered
within a sterile zone with drapes to prevent the patients
from seeing which intervention they received. In addition,
in order to ensure post-operative concealment, all patients
had a standard dressing applied to the area where a femoral
nerve block is usually performed. It was not possible to
blind the surgeon and anaesthetist delivering the interven-
tions to the treatment options. Outcome data were col-
lected by independent physiotherapists who were blinded
to the allocation of treatment.
The protocol was prepared in accordance with the Stand-
ard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional
Trials guidelines21 and published a priori.19 Statutory NHS
research and ethical approval was obtained on 23 September
2013, reference 13/WM/0316. The trial was conducted in
accordance with the Medicines for Human use (Clinical Tri-
als) Regulations 2004, the International Conference on Har-
monisation Good Clinical Practice and reported in line with
the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement.22
Patients were consulted during their routine clinical
appointments to determine if the research question was
important to them and those in a successful pilot trial were
asked to provide feedback on the processes of the trial.21 A
small number of those in the pilot trial helped to develop
the full proposal including the choice of primary outcome
measure. One of the patients who was in the trial steering

group was active in overseeing the running of the trial and
the ways of disseminating the results.
Sample size and analysis plan. The available literature sug-
gested a difference in the VAS for pain between the groups
of 12 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) 9 to 15) to be the
minimum clinically important difference (MCID).23 Based
on pilot data, the standard deviation (SD) for VAS for pain
was 30 mm.24 Therefore, to test the null hypothesis of
equality of the means of the treatment groups, assuming
approximate normality for the VAS, primary outcome data
for 264 patients (132 in each arm) were required for 90%
power and 5% significance.
Initial analysis investigated differences in the primary
outcome scores on an intention-to-treat basis using an inde-
pendent samples t-test. This was augmented with linear
regression analysis that adjusted for age, gender and type of
anaesthetic. Tests were two-sided and considered to pro-
vide evidence for a significant difference at p < 0.05. Esti-
mates of treatment effects were presented with 95% CIs.
For continuous approximately normally distributed sec-
ondary outcome measures (e.g. OKS, EQ-5D-5L), data
were analysed in a similar manner to the primary outcome.
In hospital medication variables were log transformed prior
to testing in order to improve the approximation of the nor-
mal distribution. Data, such as adverse events, were com-
pared between groups using chi-squared tests.
Some data were not available due to the voluntary with-
drawal of patients, lack of completion of individual items
or loss to follow-up. Where possible, the reasons for miss-
ing data were determined and reported. All analysis pre-

Results
A total of 264 patients were recruited between March 2014
and November 2015 and, of these, 262 were randomised.
Two patients were not randomised due to an error of data
entry. Figure 1 shows the flow of patients through the trial.
Baseline characteristics including age, gender, OKS and
EQ-5D-5L were similar in both groups (Table I).
A total of 59 anaesthetists performed the femoral nerve
blocks (median, three per anaesthetist, interquartile range
(IQR) 1 to 7; three operation notes did not name the anaes-
thetist) and 33 surgeons performed the periarticular infil-
trations (median, four per surgeon, IQR 2 to 11).
The main outcomes are shown in Table II.
On an intention-to-treat primary analysis, the mean
difference between groups was not statistically significant;
-0.9 (p = 0.770, 95% CI -5.3 to 7.2). Using multiple linear
regression analysis to adjust for age, gender and type of
anaesthetic, the mean difference between groups was not
statistically significant: -0.7 (p = 0.834, 95% CI -5.9 to 4.5).
The results of the secondary analysis are shown in Tables
II and III.
On the first post-operative day, after physiotherapy, the
mean pain scores increased in both groups, (femoral nerve
block group, 49; periarticular group, 52), however,
there was no statistically significant difference between
groups; -2.7 (p = 0.371, 95% CI -8.6 to 3.2). The mean dif-
ferences in pain scores on the second post-operative day,
both before and after physiotherapy, were also not statisti-
cally different between the groups, 2.7 (p = 0.435, 95% CI
-4.2 to 9.7) and 1.8 (p = 0.591, 95% CI -4.8 to 8.3), respec-
tively. Figure 2 shows the pain scores on the first and
second post-operative days as box plots.

post-operative day (treatment difference 16.4 seconds;
p = 0.051, 95% CI -0.1 to 33.0), were both marginally in
favour of periarticular infiltration and had borderline
statistical significance. The mean flexion of the knee on the
second post-operative day was better in the periarticular
group, however the difference between the groups was
small at -5.4° (p = 0.005, 95% CI -9.1 to -1.6). Amongst
the remaining functional outcomes on the first and second
post-operative days, there was no significant difference
between groups: the ability to straight leg raise (day 1
p = 0.192 and day 2 p = 0.219), the ability to transfer inde-
pendently (day 1 p = 0.069 and day 2 p = 0.254) and timed
up and go (day 1 p = 0.161 and day 2 p = 0.349).
There was no statistically significant difference in the
total use of analgesia up to 24 and 48 hours post-
operatively for paracetamol (p = 0.338 and 0.817, respec-
tively), ibuprofen (p = 0.285 and 0.309, respectively) or
gabapentin (p = 0.835 and 0.671, respectively) which were
given routinely. However, the requirement for morphine,
which was administered according to requirement, was less
up to 24 hours post-operatively in those receiving periartic-
ular infiltration (74% of the total dose given in the femoral
nerve block group, p = 0.042, 95% CI 55 to 99). At 48
hours there was no statistically significant difference in the
equivalent dose of morphine (p = 0.203) (Table III).
At six weeks post-operatively, there was no statistically
significant differences in mean OKS (-0.4, p = 0.673, 95%
CI -2.4 to 1.5), EQ-5D-5L (-0.01, p = 0.670, 95% CI -0.06
to 0.04) or DN2 scores (0.4, p = 0.118, 95% CI -0.04 to
0.77).
There were two deaths during the trial. One patient who
had been allocated to and received periarticular infiltration
died of a myocardial infarction (Table IV). One patient who
had been allocated to and received a femoral nerve block
died of sepsis. There were 39 AEs, of which 27 were SAE,
amongst 31 patients in the femoral nerve block group, and
Table IV.

51 AEs, of which 38 were SAEs, amongst 42 patients in the
periarticular infiltration group (Table IV). The most fre-
quent AEs were: superficial wound infection (15), acute
renal failure (nine) and chest infection (eight). None were
related to the type of anaesthetic under investigation.
Following the primary analysis, we did a post hoc per
protocol analysis for equivalence of outcome. This also
revealed that the mean difference between the groups
was not statistically significant 0.04 (95%CI -6.2 to 6.3,
p = 0.990).
Discussion
This trial shows that pain scores on the day after TKA are
the same in patients who have had a femoral nerve block
and those who have had periarticular infiltration of local
anaesthetic. It was not designed to show equivalence in out-
comes; however, the 95% CIs for the difference between the
groups in the per protocol analysis were only just over half
of the pre-specified MCID. We can, therefore be confident
that we have excluded a clinically important difference in
pain scores on the first post-operative day between the two
interventions.
Although the pain scores were similar in the two groups,
the use of morphine up to 24 hours post-operatively was
less in the periarticular group. Although morphine is an
effective supplementary analgesic for post-operative pain,
dose dependent systemic side effects, including nausea,
vomiting, respiratory depression, pruritus, reduced gut
mobility and urinary retention mean that lower doses are
preferable.25
Two other early functional secondary outcomes had bor-
derline significant differences between the groups (the ability
to transfer independently on day 1 and the flexion of the
knee on day 2) and both were in favour of periarticular infil-
tration. Although caution is needed in interpreting the rele-
vance of the secondary observations, these and the primary
outcome findings support the suggestion that periarticular
infiltration is a good alternative to femoral nerve block. Both
are designed to provide early analgesia and by six weeks we
found no difference in PROMs between the groups.
None of the AEs were directly attributed to either of the
interventions and the frequency of AEs was similar in both
treatment groups, and were comparable with those
reported in the literature, suggesting that periarticular infil-
tration does not pose an additional risk to the patients.26-28
Periarticular infiltration has previously been compared
with femoral nerve block for early pain relief following TKA
in three small RCTs including, in total, 181 patients.9-11
However, meta-analyses by Marques et al8 and Albrecht et
al29 and a Cochrane Review by Chan et al2 of these RCTs
have been unable to draw firm conclusions about the com-
parative effectiveness of these interventions, largely because
of a lack of statistical power and moderate quality
(GRADE)30 evidence. Our results now show that periartic-
ular infiltration offers comparable early pain relief, and
safety. Patients and clinicians should therefore consider
other factors including the availability of specialist
equipment such as a nerve stimulator or ultrasound for
administering the femoral nerve block, and any specific
contraindications when making a preference for either
intervention. 
The main strengths of this trial are the blinded assess-
ment of outcome and its pragmatic design. It followed a
published protocol and included an intention-to-treat pri-
mary analysis, meaning that the findings should be applica-
ble to routine clinical practice. 
The main weakness is that it involved only one NHS cen-
tre. Although, it included many different surgeons and
anaesthetists, the study should be repeated in other health-
care settings. We tested only one regime of periarticular
infiltration, but there are others with different types and
doses of local anaesthetic. However, the regime that we
chose and tested was representative of our region and many
hospitals in the United Kingdom. An error of data entry
resulted in the final sample for primary analysis being two
less than anticipated. However, the evaluated treatment dif-
ference of -0.9 was less than the MCID of 1.2, and smaller
than the anticipated SD; we are therefore confident that the
study was not underpowered and that there is no clinical
difference between the two treatment arms.
In conclusion, we did not find a clinically meaningful dif-
ference in the perception of pain on the day after TKA
between patients who have a femoral nerve block and those
having a periarticular infiltration of local anaesthetic. Peri-
articular infiltration, which can be administered without
the need for specialist additional equipment and reduces
post-operative morphine requirements, should be consid-
ered as a viable and safe alternative to femoral nerve block
for early pain relief following TKA.
Take home message:
- Periarticular infiltration is a good alternative to femoral nerve
block for managing post-operative pain following TKA.
- Periarticular infiltration may reduce a patients’ requirements for addi-
tional morphine following TKA.
- Within the limits of the trial, periarticular infiltration was a safe alterna-
tive to femoral nerve block.
