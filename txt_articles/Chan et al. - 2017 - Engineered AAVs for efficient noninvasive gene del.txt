Abstract
Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are commonly used for in vivo gene transfer. Nevertheless, 
AAVs that provide efficient transduction across specific organs or cell populations are needed. 
Here, we describe AAV-PHP.eB and AAV-PHP.S, capsids that efficiently transduce the central and 
peripheral nervous systems, respectively. In the adult mouse, intravenous administration of 1×1011 
vector genomes (vg) of AAV-PHP.eB transduced 69% of cortical and 55% of striatal neurons, 
while 1×1012 vg AAV-PHP.S transduced 82% of dorsal root ganglion neurons, as well as cardiac 
and enteric neurons. The efficiency of these vectors facilitates robust co-transduction and 
stochastic, multicolor labeling for individual cell morphology studies. To support such efforts, we 
provide methods for labeling a tunable fraction of cells without compromising color diversity. 
Furthermore, when used with cell type-specific promoters, these AAVs provide targeted gene 
expression across the nervous system and enable efficient and versatile gene manipulation 
throughout the nervous system of transgenic and non-transgenic animals.

 INTRODUCTION
Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs)1 have been extensively used as vehicles for gene transfer 
to the nervous system enabling gene expression and knockdown, gene editing2,3, circuit 
modulation4,5, in vivo imaging6,7, disease model development8, and the evaluation of 
therapeutic candidates for the treatment of neurological diseases9. AAVs are well suited for 
these applications because they provide safe, long-term expression in the nervous 
system10,11. Most of these applications rely on local AAV injections into the adult brain to 
bypass the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and to temporally and spatially restrict transgene 
expression.
Targeted AAV injections have also been used for gene delivery to peripheral neurons to test 
strategies for treating chronic pain12,13 and for tracing, monitoring, and modulating specific 
subpopulations of vagal neurons14,15. Many peripheral neuron populations, however, are 
difficult to access surgically (e.g., dorsal root ganglia (DRG), nodose ganglia, sympathetic 
chain ganglia, and cardiac ganglia) or are widely distributed (e.g., the enteric nervous 
system), thereby limiting methods for genetic manipulation of these targets. Likewise, in the 
CNS, single localized injections may be insufficient to study circuits in larger species16 or to 
test gene therapies for diseases that involve the entire nervous system or widely distributed 
cell populations (e.g., Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer’s, 
spinal muscular atrophy, Friedreich’s ataxia, and numerous lysosomal storage diseases)9.
Systemic AAV delivery provides a non-invasive alternative for broad gene delivery to the 
nervous system17; however, the high viral load required and relatively low transduction 
efficiency have limited wide adoption of this method. Several groups have developed AAVs 
that enhance gene transfer to the CNS after intravenous delivery. The recently reported AAV-
AS capsid18, which utilizes a polyalanine N-terminal extension to the AAV9.4719 VP2 
capsid protein, provides higher neuronal transduction, particularly in the striatum, which 
may have applications for Huntington’s disease. Similarly, the AAV-BR1 capsid20, based on 
AAV2, may be useful for applications that require more efficient and selective transduction 
of brain endothelial cells. Using a cell type-specific capsid selection method we developed 
called CREATE (Cre REcombinase-based AAV Targeted Evolution), we recently identified 
AAV-PHP.B, a capsid that transduces the majority of neurons and astrocytes across many 
regions of the adult mouse brain and spinal cord after intravenous injection21. While the 
efficiency of AAV-PHP.B opens up new possibilities for CNS-wide genetic modification, it 
requires a substantial dose of vector (e.g., 1 × 1012 vg per adult mouse or higher).
Here, we used CREATE to further evolve AAV-PHP.B for more efficient transduction of 
neurons throughout the adult mouse brain and spinal cord. We describe a novel enhanced 
variant of AAV-PHP.B, AAV-PHP.eB, which lowers the viral load required to transduce the 
majority of CNS neurons. Notably, we also report the characterization of a second capsid 
variant, AAV-PHP.S, that displays improved tropism towards peripheral neurons, including 
those in the DRG, cardiac ganglia, and enteric nervous system.
AAVs are also used for the bulk study of neuronal anatomical connectivity and 
morphology22 and are components of multi-viral strategies for tracing the relationships

 between bulk inputs and outputs23. At the single-cell level, AAV-based multicolor labeling 
systems24 have been developed with the goal of improving tracing efforts. However, the lack 
of control over the labeling density and uniformity of color diversity has been a persistent 
challenge24. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a two-component viral 
vector system to stochastically label cells with a wide range of hues while independently 
controlling the fraction of cells labeled. In addition, using the novel capsids reported here, 
we expressed a variety of fluorescent reporters under different cell type-specific promoters, 
supporting the potential use of these vectors for population-wide genetic manipulations of 
the nervous system in Cre transgenic or wild-type mice.
RESULTS
Engineered AAV capsids for efficient transduction across the central and peripheral 
nervous systems
Here we report two novel AAV capsids that provide increased gene transfer to the CNS and 
the PNS via the vasculature. We developed these vectors by applying the previously 
published in vivo capsid selection method, CREATE21 (Fig. 1a) to AAV-PHP.B and AAV9 
as parental capsids. First, we sought to evolve the previously described AAV-PHP.B vector 
for more efficient tropism towards the CNS. We generated an AAV capsid library in which 
the AAV-PHP.B 7-mer targeting sequence was modified by randomizing three consecutive 
amino acids (AAs) in an overlapping fashion across the 7-mer and flanking AAs (Methods). 
To provide selective pressure for capsids that transduce both neurons and glia, we subjected 
the library to parallel in vivo selections in adult Vglut2-IRES-Cre, Vgat-IRES-Cre, and 
GFAP-Cre mice, which express Cre in glutamatergic neurons, GABAergic neurons and 
astrocytes, respectively. After two rounds of selection, we found that a variant comprising 
the sequence DGT in place of the AAV-PHP.B sequence AQTLAVPFK at AA positions 
587–589 (Fig. 1b) was enriched in all three transgenic lines (11.1%, 12.1%, and 15.7% of 
the total recovered sequences, respectively). We used this DGT substitution variant or AAV-
PHP.B to package a single-stranded (ss) AAV reporter genome that expresses a nuclear-
localized GFP (NLS-GFP) from the constitutive CAG promoter, (ssAAV-CAG-NLS-GFP), 
and delivered 1 × 1011 vg of the viruses by intravenous injection to adult mice. We found 
that the DGT substitution variant appeared to transduce the CNS more efficiently than AAV-
PHP.B as judged by wide-field fluorescence microscopy of the intact brain (Fig. 1c) and 
confocal microscopy on thin sections from brain (Fig. 1f) and spinal cord (Fig. 1g). We refer 
to this enhanced AAV-PHP.B variant as AAV-PHP.eB and present further quantitative 
characterization below. Second, we performed a separate selection of an AAV9-based 7-mer 
library in GFAP-Cre mice21. After two rounds of selection, we found a variant (7-mer 
sequence – QAVRTSL, representing 33.3% of the total sequences recovered; Fig. 1b). As 
above, we evaluated the capsid against AAV9, its parent capsid, by packaging the ssAAV-
CAG-NLS-GFP reporter and delivering the vectors at 1 × 1012 vg/mouse. While the 
QAVRTSL variant and AAV9 both showed similar sparse transduction of the brain (Fig. 1c, 
d), the QAVRTSL variant notably appeared to strongly transduce peripheral sensory 
afferents entering the spinal cord and brain stem (Fig. 1c–e). We refer to this variant as AAV-
PHP.S. While unexpected given the selection scheme, the improved tropism for sensory

 neurons provided by AAV-PHP.S could be useful for widespread gene transfer to cells of the 
PNS. We explore this possibility below.
Together these data indicate that the tropism of AAV9 can be routed towards either more 
efficient CNS or PNS transduction (Fig. 1c), depending on the AA insertion/modification. A 
comparison of the AA insertion/modification sequences of AAV-PHP.eB and AAV-PHP.S 
along with their parent capsids, AAV-PHP.B and AAV9, respectively, is shown in Fig. 1b, 
and their nucleotide sequences and relative viral production efficiencies are provided in 
(Supplementary Table 1).
Quantification of transduction by AAV-PHP.eB and AAV-PHP.S
Next, we quantified the transduction efficiency of AAV-PHP.eB and AAV-PHP.B three 
weeks after intravenous administration of 1 × 1011 vg of ssAAV-CAG-NLS-GFP. First, when 
compared with AAV-PHP.B, AAV-PHP.eB provided significantly increased (> 2.5-fold) GFP 
fluorescence per cell nucleus throughout the cortex and striatum and (> 1.8-fold) in 
cerebellar Purkinje cells (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 1). To quantify expression in 
Purkinje cells, an automated cell segmentation and analysis pipeline was developed 
(Supplementary Fig. 2 and Methods). AAV-PHP.eB also showed an increase over AAV-
PHP.B in both the percentage of total cortical cells transduced (DAPI+ cells that express 
GFP; 51 ± 2% vs. 37 ± 3%; Fig. 2a,e) and the percentage of NeuN+ neurons transduced (69 
± 4% vs. 49 ± 7%; Fig. 2b,e). In the striatum, a similar trend towards increased transduction 
by AAV-PHP.eB compared to AAV-PHP.B was observed from quantifying both the 
percentage of DAPI+ and NeuN+ cells that express GFP (DAPI+: 42 ± 5% vs. 26 ± 5%; Fig. 
2a,e; NeuN+: 55 ± 7% vs 36 ± 8%, Fig. 2b,e). In the cerebellum, we observed an increase in 
the percentage of Calbindin+ Purkinje cells that expressed GFP in mice injected with AAV-
PHP.eB as compared with AAV-PHP.B (76 ± 5% vs. 37 ± 10%, Fig. 2c,e). Both vectors 
transduced a similar percentage of S100+ glia in the cortex as well as the striatum (Fig. 2e 
and Supplementary Fig. 3).
Next, we examined the transduction efficiency of AAV-PHP.S compared with AAV9, a 
vector known to provide broad transduction of the PNS and many peripheral organs after 
intravenous delivery17,25,26. We packaged ssAAV-CAG-NLS-GFP into AAV9 or AAV-
PHP.S, administered the viruses to adult mice by intravenous injection at 1 × 1012 vg/mouse, 
and then assessed GFP expression after three weeks. In the DRG, AAV-PHP.S provided a 
significant increase in transduction over AAV9 (Fig. 3a) as quantified both by native GFP 
fluorescence per cell nucleus (> 2.6-fold) (Fig. 3b) and by the percentage of cells positive 
for PGP9.5, a marker for neurons in the PNS, that co-expressed GFP (82 ± 2% vs. 46 
± 0.7%) (Fig. 3c). AAV-PHP.S also transduced the cardiac ganglia (Fig. 3a) and cells within 
the enteric nervous system of the small intestine and colon (Fig. 3d and Supplementary 
Video 1) with high efficiency. To determine the identity of enteric nervous system cells 
transduced by AAV-PHP.S, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the neuronal 
marker PGP9.5 and the astrocyte marker S100b. The majority of GFP+ cells within the 
myenteric plexus (Fig. 3d) and submucosal plexus (Supplementary Fig. 4) of the small 
intestine and colon co-localized to PGP9.5+ cells with sparse and faint transduction seen in 
S100b+ cells (Supplementary Video 1). Notably, we also observed robust transduction by

 AAV-PHP.S of cells in many organs, including the liver, lungs, heart, and stomach cells 
within the muscle and myenteric plexus layers (Supplementary Fig. 4).
AAV-PHP.eB and AAV-PHP.S enable efficient co-transduction of neurons
The increased transduction efficiency and enhanced expression per cell observed with both 
AAV-PHP.eB and AAV-PHP.S, relative to their parental capsids, suggested that a large 
fraction of cells are transduced by multiple AAV genomes when administered at the above 
doses. The transduction efficiency of these vectors may therefore enable applications that 
require expression from more than one AAV genome. To test this, we co-administered a 
cocktail of three AAV genomes with the single fluorescent proteins (XFPs) mRuby2, 
mNeonGreen, and mTurquoise2 expressed from the human Synapsin (hSyn1) promoter, 
which limits expression to neurons. The three-vector mix (AAV-hSyn1-3XFP) was packaged 
into AAV-PHP.eB or AAV-PHP.S and injected into adult wild-type mice. Co-administration 
of these vectors resulted in dense labeling of cells with multiple colors in the brain when 
delivered with AAV-PHP.eB and in the enteric nervous system with AAV-PHP.S (Fig. 4a). 
Because cells transduced by a single vector would express only one of the three XFPs, and 
thereby be red, green or blue, the wide color diversity seen in both the brain and the enteric 
nervous system demonstrates that these novel capsids enable the independent and stochastic 
co-transduction of neurons by multiple viral vectors.
Tunable density multiplexed gene expression
Multicolor labeling by AAVs can benefit single-cell morphology and tracing studies27. 
However, direct local virus injections22,24 may not provide uniform color diversity because 
of the non-uniform distribution of vector copies radiating outward from the injection site24. 
We predicted that systemically delivered AAVs may offer a solution to this challenge 
because the distribution of labeled cells and color diversity would be more uniform. Indeed, 
when we delivered three separate XFPs expressed from the CAG promoter (AAV-
CAG-3XFP; Fig. 4b) we observed a wide range of hues in the cortex, striatum, and 
cerebellum (Fig. 4d, left). However, this strategy, where the expression of the transgene is 
controlled in cis, couples the expression level, labeling density, and the color diversity to the 
virus dose. As expected, when we lowered the virus dose we observed that the density and 
color diversity were reduced (i.e., most cells were labeled by primary colors – red, green, or 
blue – likely reflecting single transduction events) (Fig. 4d, right). Therefore, to achieve 
stochastic, multicolor labeling while reducing the fraction of labeled cells, we sought a two-
component AAV system in which the expression of XFPs in each cell is dependent on a 
separate inducer vector that is co-transduced at a variable dose. In this way, color diversity 
could be decoupled from the labeling density. We developed two inducer systems: one that 
uses the tetracycline (tet)-inducible system – a tet-off transactivator (tTA) and a tet-
responsive element (TRE)28 (Fig. 4c) – and a second that uses the FLPo-FRT system29 
(Supplementary Fig. 5). Importantly, both systems allow for cell type-specific expression 
using FLEX/DIO vectors and the extensive collection of Cre transgenic animals available 
(e.g., JAX, ABI, and GENSAT).
The tTA-TRE based system relies on co-administration of three separate vectors with XFP 
expression driven by a TRE containing promoter, along with an adjustable dose of an AAV-

 tTA expression vector. To evaluate this approach, we co-administered ssAAV-TRE-
mNeonGreen along with a ssAAV-CAG-tTA vector. We delivered ssAAV-TRE-mNeonGreen 
at the same dose across all animals while varying the dose of the ssAAV-CAG-tTA inducer. 
We observed a dose-dependent reduction in the density of cells expressing mNeonGreen two 
weeks after intravenous delivery of the two vectors (Supplementary Fig. 6). Similar results 
were achieved with the two-component FLPo-FRT system (Supplementary Fig. 5). Although 
both systems are viable, we focused on the tTA-TRE system because (1) the short (417 bp) 
TRE promoter is compatible with longer transgenes, and (2) the positive-feedback loop in 
the AAV-tTA vector provides high levels of expression (Supplementary Fig. 7). However, 
care should be taken with long-term use of the tTA-TRE overexpression system to avoid the 
potential toxicity seen with overexpression of the tTA30.
We next sought to test the tTA-TRE system with multicolor labeling. Using the same 3XFP 
cocktail described above (Fig. 4a), we generated three ssAAV-TRE-XFP genomes and 
delivered the vectors at a high dose to all animals, along with either 1 × 1011 or 1 × 1010 vg/
animal of a neuron specific inducer vector (ssAAV-PHP.eB:hSyn1-tTA). Three weeks after 
intravenous administration we observed robust and inducer dose-dependent labeling (Fig. 
4e). Even at the lower inducer dose, and in contrast with the single-component expression 
system (Fig. 4d), many cells expressed more than one of the three XFP transgenes. We 
quantified the fraction of cells that contained each XFP and found that, with the two-
component system at a low inducer dose, at least 42% of the labeled cells within the cortex, 
striatum, and the Purkinje cell population expressed all three XFPs. In comparison, in the 
one-component system, less than 10% of the labeled cells in the cortex and 1% of cells in 
the striatum and the Purkinje cell population expressed all three XFPs (Fig. 4f). Finally, we 
utilized the two-component system to trace mitral cells in the olfactory bulb of an adult 
Tbx21-Cre mouse, a transgenic line that labels mitral and tufted cells in the olfactory bulb. 
Three weeks after intravenous administration of 1 × 1012 vg/animal of a cocktail of TRE-
DIO-XFPs and 1 × 1010 vg/animal of AAV-ihSyn1-tTA, a positive feedback inducible tTA 
driven by the hSyn promoter, we observed multicolor labeling at a density that facilitated 
segmentation of several local dendritic arbors after tissue clearing (Fig. 4g).
A versatile AAV toolbox with cell-type specific promoters
A further advantage of systemic AAV administration is that it provides a means to transduce 
populations of specific cell types even if the cells are distributed broadly. As a proof-of-
concept that AAV-PHP.eB can be used to achieve cell type-restricted expression across the 
brain, we co-administered three ssAAV genomes that each expressed a spectrally distinct 
XFP controlled by a different cell type-specific promoter. In this way, we were able to 
independently express distinct transgenes in neurons (hSyn1), astrocytes (GFAP), and 
oligodendrocytes (MBP) within the same animal (Fig. 5a). We also packaged AAV vectors 
containing previously published promoters that restrict reporter expression to 
catecholaminergic cells (mouse tyrosine hydroxylase; mTH), serotonergic cells (FEV 
promoter; Ple67), Purkinje cells (PCP2 promoter; Ple155)31, or GABAergic interneurons 
within the forebrain (mouse distal-less homeobox; mDlx5/6)32 and administered these 
intravenously (Fig. 5b–e). We provide quantification of the specificity and efficiency of 
reporter transduction using these gene regulatory elements in (Supplementary Table 2).

 Similarly, to achieve cell type-restricted expression within the PNS, we used AAV-PHP.S to 
co-administer the 3XFP cocktail under the control of the hSyn1 promoter (ssAAV-
PHP.S:hSyn-3XFP) or by expressing the 3XFP cocktail from the CAG promoter in a double-
floxed inverted open reading frame (ssAAV-PHP.S:CAG-DIO-3XFP) for expression in 
cholinergic neurons when used with ChAT-IRES-Cre transgenic mice (Supplementary Fig. 
8). Using this strategy together with the two-component TRE-tTA system described above, 
we were able to sparsely label cholinergic neurons within the myenteric plexus in the 
proximal colon and trace the processes of multiple neurons for several millimeters 
(Supplementary Fig. 8).
In Supplementary Table 3, we summarize the available constructs presented here, along with 
their applications within this paper.
DISCUSSION
Using the previously described CREATE21 selection method, we have developed and 
characterized two novel capsids, AAV-PHP.eB and AAV-PHP.S, that enable efficient and 
noninvasive gene delivery throughout the CNS or PNS and visceral organs, respectively 
(Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 4). As in our prior study21, these variants were identified 
after only two rounds of in vivo selection, further demonstrating how CREATE can be used 
to identify AAV capsids with enhanced transduction properties.
Previously, we selected for AAV capsids that more efficiently crossed the BBB and 
transduced GFAP-expressing astrocytes. Several of the identified variants, most notably 
AAV-PHP.B, also transduced neurons, although in general not with the same efficiency. In 
the current work, we sought to improve neuronal transduction while maintaining strong 
astrocytic transduction by performing parallel selections for capsids that transduced two 
widely distributed glutamatergic and GABAergic neuronal populations as well as astrocytes. 
This led to the development of the AAV-PHP.eB capsid, a variant that was consistently 
enriched through selections in each of the three Cre lines. Remarkably, AAV-PHP.eB differs 
from AAV-PHP.B at only two AAs adjacent to the original 7-mer insertion, yet at the 
relatively low systemic dose of 1 × 1011 vg/mouse it transduces the majority of neurons in 
the cortex and striatum, as well as over 75% of cerebellar Purkinje cells. The success of this 
approach suggests that the continued evolution of the AAV-PHP.B-based capsid using 
CREATE in multiple Cre lines is a viable strategy to improve transduction of other cell 
types, such as oligodendrocytes, while maintaining the overall CNS tropism.
We also describe the AAV-PHP.S capsid, which we identified by selecting for capsids that 
transduce GFAP-expressing cells. Although the mechanism underlying the selection of this 
variant is not clear, its discovery is nevertheless important; to date, there have been no 
reports of recombinant vectors capable of efficient, widespread transduction of peripheral 
neurons via systemic delivery in adult animals. Consequently, studies of PNS circuitry are 
arguably lagging behind those in the CNS. Many peripheral neuronal populations are 
challenging to access surgically, especially in small rodents, owing to their location or broad 
distribution. For example, the DRG are a key target for gene therapy or genetic manipulation 
in the study of pain13,33. Our finding that AAV-PHP.S transduces at least 80% of DRG

 neurons should enable high coverage delivery of transgenes to multiple DRG. More broadly, 
AAV-PHP.S also transduces neurons in the enteric nervous system and in other peripheral 
ganglia, such as the cardiac ganglia, and could provide system-wide gene delivery to these 
populations, or to subsets of these populations when used with Cre transgenic lines or cell 
type-specific promoters. Encouragingly, several recent studies have demonstrated that the 
tools developed for studying the brain can also be applied to probe the function and 
projections of specific cell types within the PNS12,14,15. The importance of anatomically and 
functionally mapping the PNS has been recognized by the recent NIH initiative for 
Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (SPARC), and the novel tropism of 
AAV-PHP.S may bring about new strategies to modulate PNS circuits through genetic tools 
such as optogenetics4 or chemogenetics5. For example, systemic Flp- and Cre-dependent 
effectors delivered via AAV-PHP.S to Cre transgenic animals or used in combination with 
circuit-specific retrograde Cre viruses should allow for circuit-based interrogation of PNS 
function and enable the types of experiments now routinely conducted in the CNS4,34.
The improved transduction efficiency we observed from both AAV-PHP.eB and AAV-PHP.S 
relative to their parental capsids was apparent from both the increased number of transduced 
cells and the increased expression level per cell (Fig 2, 3 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The 
higher expression in individual cells likely results from an increased mean number of vector 
genomes per cell, as supported by the high frequency of cells expressing multiple XFPs (Fig. 
4a). This suggests that for applications that do not require high expression levels per cell, the 
viral doses could be lowered from those used in this study. Lowering the viral load used for 
systemic gene delivery will reduce cost and production burden1 and minimize the risk for 
adverse reactions to the viral components35.
As AAV vector engineering efforts continue to improve the efficiency of transduction of 
specific organs or cell populations36, widespread gene transfer will become a more viable 
alternative to the development of germline transgenics. To facilitate studies in nontransgenic 
animals, it will be necessary to develop additional vehicles with improved transduction 
efficiency and specificity and to identify gene regulatory elements that can be used to restrict 
expression to defined populations. Finding short enhancers that provide the expected 
restriction in expression has proven challenging37, but more recent efforts31 are expanding 
the collection of enhancer-promoters available. Here, we evaluated several gene regulatory 
elements and found that it was possible to achieve expression that was largely restricted to 
the expected cell types. If the separate vector components are translatable across species, 
vector-based genetic manipulations of specific cell types may become more feasible in 
genetically intractable organisms. Notably, intravenously administered AAV-PHP.B provided 
improved transduction of the rat CNS, relative to AAV938. Recently, a Dlx5/6 enhancer was 
found to drive expression that was largely restricted to GABAergic neurons in the 
telencephalon of a panel of vertebrate species32. Here, we further validate the Dlx5/6 
enhancer vector for forebrain-wide GABAergic neuron expression when delivered using 
intravenous AAV-PHP.eB (Fig. 5e).
Cell morphology both informs and determines cell function39,40, and numerous tools have 
been developed for morphology and connectivity applications41,42, especially in the 
brain43,44. To enable tracing of cellular processes, sparse labeling of cells has been a key

 enabler – whether this comes from restricted gene or dye delivery (e.g. single-cell 
electroporation45,46) or from stochastic multicolor labeling and color-channel 
separation24,43,44. Both viral and transgenic approaches have been employed to address this 
problem. Although transgenic mice with sparse gene expression47,48 are useful, AAVs24 
provide a versatile platform that can be quickly customized with up-to-date tools, promoters, 
and recombinase-dependent expression control systems. Furthermore, vectors can be 
delivered through different routes or at a specific dose to control the location and fraction of 
cells labeled. For these reasons, we developed an AAV-based expression system that allows 
for sparse multicolor labeling. This system uses two AAV components: a cocktail of XFP 
encoding vectors that exist in the off-state until induced by a second AAV vector that can be 
delivered at an empirically determined dose to provide expression in the desired fraction of 
co-transduced cells. We demonstrated that this system is well suited to the use of 
systemically delivered AAV-PHP.eB and AAV-PHP.S to achieve relatively uniform and 
sparse expression in the CNS and PNS. In addition, decoupling the relationship between the 
labeling density and the expression level may have additional applications. For example, 
sparse, high-level expression could be beneficial for in vivo monitoring of neural activity 
with genetically encoded activity indicators by lowering the background fluorescence during 
wide-field imaging49 or large area 2-photon imaging50. Furthermore, a similar framework 
could be applied to the understanding of how neuronal circuitry and morphology change 
during normal and diseased states. Future applications of this two-component approach 
could also be used to achieve intersectional gene expression in defined populations through 
circuit-specific delivery of one or both components or through the use of unique capsid-
promoter or capsid-capsid combinations that serve to restrict expression to more specific 
populations.
Overall, the vector resources we present here expand the AAV toolbox for the genetic 
modification of neurons with the central and peripheral nervous systems.
METHODS
Animals
All procedures were approved by the California Institute of Technology Institutional Animal 
Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (JAX) - 
C57Bl/6J mice (000664), GFAP-Cre (012886)51, Vgat-IRES-Cre (016962)52, Vglut2-IRES-
Cre (016963)52, and Tbx21-Cre (024507)53. Male or female mice were used. Mice were 
randomly assigned to groups of predetermined sample size. All experiments with direct 
comparisons were performed in parallel to minimize variability.
In vivo selection
The AAV-PHP.eB capsid was identified by selecting for AAV-PHP.B variants that transduced 
cells in Vglut2-IRES-Cre, Vgat-IRES-Cre, and GFAP-Cre mice through two rounds of 
selection as previously described21. Intravenous administration of AAV vectors was 
performed by injection into the retro-orbital sinus of adult mice (6–8 weeks of age). The 
AAV-PHP.B capsid was modified by partial randomization of the original AAV-PHP.B 7-mer 
insertion and 4 flanking AAs (AAV-PHP.B AA positions 587 – 597). The AAV-PHP.B-based

 library was generated by PCR using primer XF21 and a mixture of 5 primers identical to the 
AAV-PHP.B template sequence with the exception of mixed bases at 3 consecutive 
randomized codons (NNK). In each primer mix, the position of the 3 randomized NNK 
codons was shifted by 6 bp (2 codons) such that each position in the 7-mer and the 2 AAs on 
each side of the 7-mer AAs were randomized, 3 AA at a time, in an overlapping manner. An 
equal amount of each of the 5 PCR products was assembled into the AAV-(delta)Cap-in-cis 
lox acceptor vector using the NEB Hi-Fi DNA Assembly Master Mix (New England Biolabs 
E2621) and used to generate the AAV-PHP.B-based AAV library. AAV-PHP.S was generated 
from an insertion of a random 7-mer between the 588-589 site of AAV9 and was identified 
from two rounds of in vivo selection in GFAP-Cre mice21.
Plasmids
The backbones of all AAV plasmids that are double inverted orientation (DIO) were based 
on pAAV-Ef1a-DIO EYFP (Addgene, #27056), and all non-DIO plasmids were based on 
pAAV-EF1a-Cre (Addgene, #55636). The backbone of pAAV-CAG-fDIO-mNeonGreen was 
based on pAAV-Ef1a-fDIO EYFP (Addgene, #55641). The fluorescent protein cDNAs for 
mTurquoise254, mNeonGreen55, mRuby256, or mKate2.5 were synthesized as gBlocks 
(Integrated DNA Technologies). The MBP-eYFPf and GFAP-mkate2.5f vectors have a 
farnesylation sequence attached by overhang PCR. The pAAV-CAG-NLS-GFP vector was 
modified by PCR to add N- and C-terminal NLS sequences and assembled using NEB Hi-Fi 
DNA Assembly Master Mix (New England Biolabs E2621). The mouse tyrosine 
hydroxylase (TH) promoter (mTH) was based on the 2.5 kb region of a published rat TH 
promoter57 and myelin basic promoter (MBP)58. Both were directly cloned from mouse 
genomic DNA. The hSyn1 promoter59 was cloned from pAAV-hSyn Con/Foff EYFP 
(Addgene, #55651). The GFAP (GfABC1D) promoter was previously described60 and was 
cloned upstream of a synthetic intron. The GFAP-mKate2.5 plasmid also contained 3 
tandem copies of sequences complementary to 6 miRNAs: miR-1, miR-122, miR-375, 
miR-196a, miR-743 and miR-10b inserted between the WPRE and an SV40 pA sequence. 
The TRE was PCR amplified from a SG-TRE containing plasmid28. The inducible hSyn1 
(ihSyn1) promoter was cloned by overlap PCR with the hSyn1 promoter, and 
oligonucleotides designed with a synthetic intron and 3 tetO binding sites. The AAV vectors 
expressing GFP from the Ple67 and Ple155 promoters were obtained from (Addgene, 
#49138 and #49140, respectively). The AAV-mDlx-NLS-mRuby vector was cloned by 
replacing the GFP reporter in pAAV-mDlx-GFP-Fishell-1 (Addgene, #83900) with a mRuby 
reporter fused with an N-terminal SV40 NLS.
Virus production and purification
AAVs were generated in HEK 293T cells (ATCC) using Polyethylenimine (PEI)61. 72 hours 
post transfection, viral particles were harvested from the media and after 120 hours from 
cells and the media. Viral particles from the media were precipitated with 40% polyethylene 
glycol (Sigma, 89510-1KG-F) in 500 mM NaCl and combined with cell pellets for 
processing. The cell pellets were suspended in 500 mM NaCl, 40 mM Tris, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 
pH 8, and 100 U/mL of salt-activate nuclease (Arcticzymes) at 37°C for 30 minutes. 
Afterwards, the cells were clarified by centrifugation at 2,000 × g and then purified over 
iodixanol (Optiprep, Sigma; D1556) step gradients (15%, 25%, 40%, and 60%)62. Viruses

 were concentrated using Amicon filters (EMD, UFC910024), and formulated in sterile 
phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Virus titers were measured by determining the number of 
DNAse I-resistant vg using qPCR using a linearized genome plasmid as a standard61.
Tissue preparation, immunohistochemistry and imaging
Intravenous administration of AAV vectors was performed by injection into the retro-orbital 
sinus of adult mice (6–8 weeks of age). After allowing time for expression (3 weeks unless 
otherwise noted in Results), mice were anesthetized with EUTHASOL™ (Virbac) and 
transcardially perfused first with 0.1M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4) at room temperature 
(RT) and then with freshly prepared, ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1M PB. The 
tissues were post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight and afterwards transferred to phosphate 
buffered saline (PBS) with 0.05% sodium azide. The brains, lungs, and liver were sectioned 
to 100 µm, and the spinal cord to 300 µm, using a Leica VT1200 vibratome. 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using 10% normal donkey serum (NDS), 0.1% 
Triton X-100 (no detergent was used with GAD67 staining) and 0.05% sodium azide. 
Primary antibodies used were rabbit Calbindin (1:500; Abcam, ab11426), mouse NeuN 
(1:500; EMD, MAB377), rabbit S100 (1:500; Abcam ab868), rabbit tyrosine hydroxylase 
(1:500; Abcam, ab112), goat 5-HT (1:200; Immunostar, 20079), rabbit PGP9.5 (1:500; 
Abcam, ab10404), and mouse GAD67 (1:250; EMD, MAB5406). Sections were incubated 
with primary antibodies in blocking solution (PBS with 10% NDS and 0.05% sodium azide) 
for 16–24 hrs at RT and then washed in PBS overnight and followed by secondary antibody 
incubation (Jackson Immuno Research, 711-166-152, 711-606-152, 715-166-150, or 
715-606-150) for 16–24 hrs at RT.
The dorsal root ganglia were post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4° C overnight and then cryopreserved 
in 30% sucrose at 4° C overnight. Tissues were then embedded in OCT (Tissue-Tek, 
Torrance, CA, USA), frozen in 2-methybutane on dry ice and stored at −80° C until 
sectioning. For cryosectioning, the DRGs were cut at a thickness of 16 µm using a Leica 
CM3050 and adhered to a Superfrost Plus microscope slide (Fisher Scientific, Tustin, CA, 
USA). Slides were stored at −80° C until staining. For DRG IHC, the slides were incubated 
in rabbit anti-PGP9.5 antibody (1:250, Abcam, ab10404) in blocking solution (10% horse 
serum, 0.1% triton X-100, and 0.02% sodium azide in PBS) overnight at RT. The next day, 
sections were incubated with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hr at RT 
(Jackson Immuno Research, 711-606-152). Between each step, sections were thoroughly 
washed with PBS. ProLong gold, anti-fade mounting medium (P36941; Molecular Probe, 
Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was applied to the slide before coverslip mounting.
The small intestines and colons were post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4° C overnight. Then the 
duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and proximal colon were sectioned and blocked in PBS with 
0.1% triton X-100, 3% bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% sodium azide overnight at RT. The 
next day, the tissue was incubated with the mouse on mouse blocking reagent (Vector 
Laboratories, MKB-2213) in PBS with 0.01% sodium azide at RT for 16 hours. Afterwards, 
the tissue was stained in the initial blocking solution with guinea pig anti-PGP9.5 antibody 
(1:100, Abcam, ab10410) and rabbit anti-s100 beta antibody (1:200, Abcam, ab52642) for 
48 hours and then washed in PBS with 0.01% sodium azide overnight. The secondary

 antibodies – goat anti-guinea pig Alexa 647 (A-21450) and goat anti-rabbit Alexa 555 
(A-21428) Molecular Probes, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) – were incubated in 
the initial blocking solution for 48 hours. Unbound antibodies were then washed out with 
PBS with 0.01% sodium azide overnight. Finally, samples were incubated in a refractive 
matching solution RIMS63 solution for 6 hours before imaging.
For Fig. 4b and g, samples were made transparent and mounted using ScaleS464. For Fig. 
4a,d, Fig. 5c, Supplementary Fig. 5a,b, and Fig. 6b,c samples were made transparent and 
mounted using RIMS. All other samples were mounted with Prolong Diamond Antifade 
(ThermoFisher, P36965).
For some images, the 16-bit green channel (GFP) gamma was adjusted to enable 
visualization of low and high expressing cells while avoiding oversaturation. In all cases, 
changes to contrast or gamma as well as microscope laser settings remained constant across 
sets of images that were directly compared. Images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 780 
confocal microscope fitted with the following objectives: Fluar 5×/0.25 M27 Plan-
Apochromat 10×/0.45 M27 (working distance 2.0 mm), and Plan-Apochromat 25×/0.8 Imm 
Corr DIC M27 multi-immersion or Zeiss Axiozoom V16 with a 0.7× objective fitted with a 
Hamamatsu c11440 camera.
Image processing and data analysis
All image processing was performed using Zen Black 2012, Adobe Photoshop and 
Illustrator CC, ImageJ, neuTube Build 1.0z2016, and Bitplane Imaris 8.3, and custom-made 
scripts in Matlab. For data analysis, Microsoft Excel 2016, Matlab, Python, and GraphPad 
Prism 7.01 were used.
To minimize bias, when direct comparisons for quantification (Fig 2d, 2e, 3b, and 3c) or 
direct qualitative comparisons were made, (Fig. 3b and 3d) (Supplementary Fig. 3a, 3b, 4a, 
4b and 4c) matched regions were selected for imaging by first viewing the cell type-specific 
immunostaining channel, rather than the GFP expression. Manual cell counting in the 
striatum and cortex was performed by a blinded observer (Fig. 2e). Automated counting was 
performed of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum (Fig. 2e).
To mitigate any cross-talk between the 3 fluorescent proteins, linear unmixing was used 
(Fig. 4d). For a given imaging condition, the expected cross-talk between the three 
fluorophores was evaluated based on the emission and excitation spectra of each 
fluorophore. Then, for each pixel in the RGB image the corresponding unmixed signals were 
calculated using a non-negative least square fitting.
Cell profiling was done using Imaris (Bitplane). To detect neuronal cell bodies from the 
image data, we manually analyzed cells in the cortex and striatum by drawing a region of 
interest (ROI) around each cell’s nucleus and intensity values were exported into Microsoft 
Excel and Graphpad Prism for analysis. For analysis of the cerebellum, we developed a 
computational pipeline to facilitate the automation of the whole procedure, since the highly 
organized layout of Purkinje cells allowed for high accuracy automated counting (the true 
positive rate = 88.0% and the positive predictive value = 95.5% relative to manual detection)

 To detect neuronal cell bodies from the image data (Supplementary Fig. 2), the custom 
Matlab code ‘GFPcount_from_cerebellum.m’ was used and is provided in supplementary 
software. In short, we applied a circular Hough transform to the maximum projection of the 
image stack. Prior to this process, morphological filtering with a circular structural element 
was performed with the images to remove thin fibrous processes. Each circular region 
detected from the images was considered as a single cell body. To measure the ratio of GFP-
positive cells and their intensity in the cerebellum, we applied the abovementioned cell-body 
detection method to the Calbindin channel to detect the soma of Purkinje cells and used this 
to define ROIs in the GFP channel. We then subtracted the background from each ROI to 
exclude the expression (or leakage) of GFPs in cytosol. The background was estimated by 
applying a 2D Gaussian smoothing kernel to each cell body image. Subsequently, the image 
was converted to binary, and the convex hull of the connected object therein was calculated. 
The objects whose area were smaller than 10% of the cell body were removed, and we 
considered the largest object as a nucleus of interest if there were more than one object. 
Nuclei with a mean intensity higher than 0.1 (the intensity rescaled to the range of 0–1) was 
counted as GFP-positive. The mean intensity of the nucleus was calculated by averaging the 
pixel values inside the object (Supplementary Fig. 1).
The pipeline for automated cell body detection was also applied to other analyses 
(Supplementary Fig. 7 and Fig. 4f). To measure the density of labeled cells in the sparse-
labeling system (Supplementary Fig. 6), the custom Matlab code ‘cell_density.m’ was used 
and is provided in supplementary software. In short, we applied the cell body detection 
method to the images and measured the density of detected cells by dividing the cell number 
by the area of the image. We also examined the distance between the neighboring cells; for 
each cell, all of the distances to other cells were calculated, and the minimum was selected 
as the distance to the closest neighbor. The values for all cells were then averaged for each 
region and condition. We used the same method to determine whether each cell expressed 1, 
2, or 3 XPFs (Fig. 4f) in the one- and two-component labeling systems by running a custom 
Matlab code ‘expressed_channel_count.m’ that can be found in the supplementary software. 
After detecting each cell body, we collected all the normalized intensity values therein from 
each channel. If the mean intensity of the channel was above 0.1, we considered that this 
gene (color) was expressed in the cell. Counting the number of expressed channels in each 
cell, we calculated the fraction of cells according to the number of expressed gene types.
To determine the mean GFP intensity (Fig. 2d and Fig 3b) the automated cell body detection 
pipeline above was used for Calbindin+ cells in the cerebellum and PGP9.5+ cells in the 
DRG along with a custom Python code ‘drg_intensity.ipynb’ that can be found in the 
supplementary software. Manual ROIs were drawn onto DAPI+ nuclei in the cortex and 
striatum using Bitplane Imaris 8.3, with the GFP channel turned off to minimize bias. The 
median fluorescence per ROI was determined and the average across all cells within each 
replicate were reported as the mean GFP intensity.

 PHP.B and AAV-PHP.eB (n = 5/group) the animal group size was chosen based on 
preliminary data that suggested a large effect size. One animal from each of the AAV-PHP.B 
and AAV-PHP.eB groups was excluded from data analysis after necropsy due to failed retro-
orbital injections. For Figure 1c, 1d, 1e, 1f, and 1g representative images were chosen from 
AAV9 (n = 5), AAV-PHP.S (n = 5), AAV-PHP.B (n = 4), and AAV-PHP.eB (n = 4). For 
Figures 2d, 2e, 3b, and 3c each dot is representative of one animal with three technical 
replicates averaged per animal. For Supplementary Figures 1a, 1b, and 1c, each line 
represents one animal with three technical replicates per animal. For Supplementary Figures 
6c and 6d, each dot represents a technical replicate for each of the three doses. For Figures 
2d, 2e, 3b, and 3c, unpaired, two-tailed t-tests were performed. Error bars show SEM. Data 
distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested. For Supplementary 
Figures 1a, 1b, and 1c statistical significance was assessed with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. 
For Supplementary Figure 6c and 6d means were compared by t-tests in which the P value is 
computed by fewest assumptions and did not assume consistent standard deviation. 
Statistical significance was determined by the Holm-Sidak method to correct for multiple 
comparisons with an alpha of 0.05.
