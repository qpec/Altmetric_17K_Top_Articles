ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVES
To determine whether more years spent in education 
is a causal risk factor for myopia, or whether myopia is 
a causal risk factor for more years in education.
DESIGN
Bidirectional, two sample mendelian randomisation 
study.
SETTING
Publically available genetic data from two consortiums 
applied to a large, independent population cohort. 
Genetic variants used as proxies for myopia and years 
of education were derived from two large genome 
wide association studies: 23andMe and Social 
Science Genetic Association Consortium (SSGAC), 
respectively.
PARTICIPANTS
67 798 men and women from England, Scotland, 
and Wales in the UK Biobank cohort with available 
information for years of completed education and 
refractive error.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Mendelian randomisation analyses were performed 
in two directions: the first exposure was the genetic 
predisposition to myopia, measured with 44 genetic 
variants strongly associated with myopia in 23andMe, 
and the outcome was years in education; and the 
second exposure was the genetic predisposition to 
higher levels of education, measured with 69 genetic 
variants from SSGAC, and the outcome was refractive 
error.
RESULTS
Conventional regression analyses of the observational 
data suggested that every additional year of education 
was associated with a more myopic refractive error 
of −0.18 dioptres/y (95% confidence interval −0.19 
to −0.17; P<2e-16). Mendelian randomisation 
analyses suggested the true causal effect was even 
stronger: −0.27 dioptres/y (−0.37 to −0.17; P=4e-
8). By contrast, there was little evidence to suggest 
myopia affected education (years in education per 
dioptre of refractive error −0.008 y/dioptre, 95% 
confidence interval −0.041 to 0.025, P=0.6). Thus, 
the cumulative effect of more years in education on 
refractive error means that a university graduate from 
the United Kingdom with 17 years of education would, 
on average, be at least −1 dioptre more myopic than 
someone who left school at age 16 (with 12 years 
of education). Myopia of this magnitude would be 
sufficient to necessitate the use of glasses for driving. 
Sensitivity analyses showed minimal evidence for 
genetic confounding that could have biased the 
causal effect estimates.
CONCLUSIONS
This study shows that exposure to more years in 
education contributes to the rising prevalence 
of myopia. Increasing the length of time spent in 
education may inadvertently increase the prevalence 
of myopia and potential future visual disability.
Introduction
Myopia, or short-sightedness, is one of the leading 
causes of visual disability worldwide, and its 
prevalence is increasing rapidly.1 2 Myopia is a 
refractive defect of the eye that causes light to focus 
in front of, rather than on, the retina, usually because 
the axial length of the eye is too long. As a result, 
distant objects appear blurred and close objects appear 
clearly (short-sight). The symptoms of myopia can be 
alleviated with spectacles, contact lenses, or refractive 
surgery, but irrespective of visual correction, the risk 
of complications from potentially blinding conditions 
such as retinal detachment, glaucoma, and myopic 
maculopathy, increase with the longer axial lengths 
associated with high myopia.3-5 Currently, 30-50% of 
adults in the United States and Europe are myopic, with 
levels of 80-90% reported in school leavers aged 17 or 18 
years in Singapore, South Korea, China, and other high 
income Eastern and South East Asian countries,1 2 5-8 
where myopic maculopathy has become one the most 
common causes of untreatable blindness.7 Based 
on existing trends, the number of people affected by 
myopia worldwide is expected to increase from 1.4 
billion to 5 billion by 2050, affecting about 50% of 
the world’s population.7 Almost 10% of these people 
(around 9 million) will have high myopia.7
For more than a century, myopia has been associated 
with higher levels of educational attainment,9 10 but

despite evidence from observational studies for an 
association between myopia and years of schooling 
or educational attainment, causal evidence for a 
role of education on myopia is lacking.6 11-13 Both 
myopia and educational attainment have a heritable 
component14-20; however, genetics cannot explain the 
rapid increase in the prevalence of myopia over one 
or two generations. The current increased prevalence 
of myopia, particularly high myopia, seems to be 
linked to an increasingly earlier age of onset and 
higher rate of progression in childhood,21 22 since 
the condition tends to remain relatively stable during 
adulthood (until myopic shifts occur secondary 
to the development of cataracts).23 Randomised 
controlled trials have shown convincingly that time 
spent outdoors in childhood partially protects against 
the development of myopia,24 25 but the association 
between myopia and time spent by children doing 
near work activities, such as reading, is less consistent 
across studies.11 26 Furthermore, the time children 
spend outdoors is typically independent of their near 
work activities, as measures of the two are generally 
uncorrelated.27-29 Consequently, it is not known with 
any certainty whether more years in education causes 
myopia, children with myopia spend more time on 
near work leading to better educational outcomes, 
children with myopia are more intelligent, or, indeed, 
an association with another confounding factor, such 
as socioeconomic position, leads to more years in 
education and myopia,6 11-13 30 since randomised trials 
that limit education in children would be unethical.
Mendelian randomisation is a type of instrumental 
variable 
analysis31 
that 
uses 
genetic 
variants 
associated with a risk factor (eg, education) as 
proxies for an environmental exposure to make 
causal inferences about the effect of the exposure on 
the outcome of interest (eg, myopia). This approach 
reduces bias from confounding and reverse causation, 
to which observational epidemiology studies are 
susceptible. It exploits the fact that genotypes are 
randomly assigned at conception. Hence, mendelian 
randomisation has been likened to a randomised 
trial by genotype, since genetic variants are not 
modifiable and are largely free from confounding.32 
33 With the recent availability of data from two large 
scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for 
educational attainment34 and myopia,15 together with 
the genotypes of approximately 488 000 participants 
in the UK Biobank, an investigation of the causal 
relation between years in education and myopia by 
bidirectional mendelian randomisation analyses35 
became possible with unprecedented statistical power. 
We investigated whether more time spent in education 
is a causal risk factor for myopia.
Methods
Study cohorts
23andMe—Pickrell et al15 reported the results of a 
GWAS for self reported myopia in a sample of 191 843 
people of European descent (106 086 cases, 85 757 
controls) carried out by the personal genomics 
company 23andMe (CA, USA). Myopia was ascertained 
by the questionnaire item “Have you ever been 
diagnosed by a doctor with nearsightedness (near 
objects are clear, far objects are blurry)?”
Social Science Genetic Association Consortium 
(SSGAC)—Okbay et al34 reported the results of a large 
meta-analysis of GWAS for educational attainment 
in 293 723 people of European descent. Educational 
attainment was defined by whether the participant 
attained a given level of schooling, based on the 
International Standard Classification of Education 
(1997) scale.36
UK Biobank—Cross sectional data from the 
baseline assessment of the UK Biobank project was 
collected between 2006 and 2010.37 UK Biobank 
recruited 502 664 participants aged 40 to 69 years 
through 22 assessment centres across the UK. 
One of two platforms was used to determine the 
genotype of participants: the BiLEVE Axiom array 
(Affymetrix, High Wycombe, UK) or the Biobank 
Axiom array (Affymetrix). All participants completed 
sociodemographic questionnaires, which included 
questions on past educational and professional 
qualifications. In the latter stages of recruitment, an 
ophthalmic assessment was introduced, and this was 
completed by approximately 23% of participants.
Definitions
Education—We determined the time spent in education 
by questionnaire as defined by the question for age 
of completed full time education in UK Biobank 
(n=336 826 participants completed the questionnaire 
at the baseline visit). The question was ascertained only 
for participants who did not have a college or university 
degree. To harmonise the educational outcome 
measure in UK Biobank (time spent in education) with 
the number of years spent in schooling (EduYears) 
variable in the SSGAC study,34 we coded participants 
with a college or university degree as having left full 
time education at age 21 years. Similarly, we assigned 
a value of 15 years for those participants who reported 
being aged less than 15 on completion of full time 
education. As schooling systems differ between 
countries, we included in the analyses only participants 
born in England, Scotland, or Wales
Refractive error—Measures of visual function were not 
performed from the start of recruitment for UK Biobank. 
Consequently, only a subset of participants underwent 
measurements of refractive error (n=127 412). This was 
measured by non-cycloplegic autorefraction (RC5000 
autorefractor; Tomey, Phoenix, AZ) after removal of 
spectacles or contact lenses. Although cycloplegic eye 
drops were not used (ie, the effect of accommodation on 
measurements of refractive error was not controlled), 
only adults in whom the effects of accommodation 
would be minimal were recruited to UK Biobank.38 Up 
to 10 measurements were taken. If the autorefractor 
reading was flagged as unreliable then we excluded 
the measurement. Spherical power and cylindrical 
power were averaged over repeat measurements.

error for each eye using the formula spherical 
power+0.5×cylindrical power. We took the average 
of the left and right mean spherical equivalent as the 
participant’s refractive error in dioptres and used 
this value in subsequent analyses (n=127 412). For 
participants with repeat measurements from separate 
visits (baseline visit and subsequent visits), we used 
only the baseline measurement. We excluded from 
the analyses those with pre-existing eye conditions 
that could affect refractive error—namely, cataracts, 
refractive laser eye surgery, injury or trauma resulting 
in vision loss, or corneal graft surgery. For example, 
cataracts are associated with a myopic shift in refractive 
error. We excluded 10 984 individuals with pre-existing 
eye conditions.
In total, 69 798 participants had valid education, 
refractive error, and genetic data available (fig 1).
Genotype data
The genetic data in UK Biobank underwent rigorous 
quality control procedures and was phased and 
imputed against a reference panel of Haplotype 
Reference Consortium (HRC), UK10K, and 1000 
Genomes Phase 3 haplotypes.39 40 Because of a problem 
with the imputation of UK10K and 1000 Genomes 
variants, we restricted analyses to HRC variants only. 
Samples were excluded based on several genotype 
based criteria: non-European ancestry, relatedness, 
mismatch between genetic sex and self reported 
gender, putative aneuploidy, outlying heterozygosity, 
and excessive missingness.39
Statistical analyses
Ordinary least squares observational analyses
Using linear regression adjusted for sex and age in 
UK Biobank, we assessed observational associations 
between refractive error and years spent in education. 
We then repeated the regression with adjustment 
for additional potentially confounding variables 
(for example, breast feeding has been reported to be 
associated with both refractive error41 and education42): 
Townsend deprivation index, birth weight, breast 
fed, and geographical coordinates of place of birth 
rounded to the nearest kilometre (northing and easting 
coordinates).
Generation of instrumental variables for mendelian 
randomisation
Pickrell et al15 reported the 50 variants most strongly 
associated with myopia in the study carried out by 
23andMe. Six variants (rs5022942, rs10887265, 
rs71041628, 
rs34016308, 
rs11658305, 
and 
rs201140091) were not in the HRC panel, leaving 44 for 
use as genetic instrumental variables in the mendelian 
randomisation analysis (see supplementary data table).
Okbay et al34 used UK Biobank as a replication cohort. 
Therefore in this study we used only genetic variants 
and summary statistics from their discovery analysis 
(http://ssgac.org/documents/EduYears_Discovery_5000.
txt). The authors identified 74 variants associated 
with educational attainment in SSGAC. Five variants 
(rs9320913, rs148734725, rs544990728, rs114598875, 
and rs8005528) were not in the HRC panel, leaving 
69 variants for use as instrumental variables (see 
supplementary data table).
For each trait we combined multiple genetic variants 
into a single weighted allele score. Compared with 
individual variants, this score has been shown to 
improve the coverage properties and reduce the bias of 
instrumental variable estimates.43 When constructing 
allele scores we used effect size estimates from the 
original GWAS publications to weight variants. To 
ensure correct coding of the effect allele we harmonised 
these variants with UK Biobank. We converted the 
genotype probabilities to effect allele (a) and non-
effect allele (A) dosages. Allele scores were calculated 
by summing the product of the weights and dosages 
across all n variants (see equations).
We calculated the proportion of variance in the 
phenotype variable explained by the allele score 
instrumental variable, by regressing the phenotype on 
its respective allele score.
Dosage = Prob (Aa) + 2 x Prob (aa)

Implementation of mendelian randomisation
Mendelian randomisation was implemented using 
the two stage least squares method in the R package 
ivpack.44 We included age and sex as covariates. To 
assess the risk of weak instrument bias, we used F tests 
to determine the strength of association in the first 
stage regressions between allele score and exposure.45 
Statistical power was assessed using the mRnd online 
calculator46 for a type I error level α=0.05 (http://

Sensitivity analyses
Confounding
We used confounding bias plots47 48 to assess relative 
bias in the instrumental variable estimate compared 
with standard multivariable regression. Such analyses 
are designed to quantify the bias present in a mendelian 
randomisation analysis in a manner analogous to 
examining the effect of adjusting or not adjusting 
for a potential confounder in a standard regression 
analysis. Additionally, in supplementary analyses we 
included suspected confounding factors as covariates 
(see supplementary table 4). The confounding 
variables considered42 49 50 were the first 10 genetic 
principal components, Townsend deprivation index, 
birth weight, breast fed, and place of birth (northing 
and easting coordinates).
Horizontal (genetic) pleiotropy
To investigate the degree of bias in the initial causal 
estimates due to pleiotropic effects, we used two 
sensitivity analyses (mendelian randomisation-Egger 
and weighted median mendelian randomisation). 
Mendelian randomisation-Egger is not valid for 
studies in which the instrumental variable-exposure 
and 
instrumental 
variable-outcome 
associations 
are calculated in the same sample (as was done 
for the main analyses in this study). Therefore, we 
ran the mendelian randomisation-Egger as a split 
sample analysis, by randomly splitting the sample 
in half (groups A and B). The supplementary data 
table shows the associations of the variants and 
time spent in education and refractive error for 
each group. Mendelian randomisation-Egger and 
weighted median methods were implemented using 
the R package TwoSampleMR (github.com/MRCIEU/
TwoSampleMR).51
Measurement error
To ensure the association between time spent in 
education and myopia was not an artefact of the 
non-normal distribution of the variable for age when 
full time education was completed, we used two 
alternative methods to recode time spent in education: 
dichotomisation into age more than 16 years when 
education was completed and age 16 years or less 
when education was completed; and excluding those 
who attended college or university. We compared the 
results with the original analyses using the continuous 
variable for age when full time education was 
completed.
The Durbin-Wu-Hausman test checks for the 
presence of endogenous variables in a regression 
model; the presence of such variables leads to 
biased effect estimates.52 53 Effect estimates from the 
observational analysis and second stage instrumental 
analysis were tested for endogeneity using the Durbin-
Wu-Hausman test.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research 
question or the outcome measures, nor were they 
involved in developing plans for recruitment, design, 
or implementation of the study. No patients were asked 
to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. 
There are no plans to disseminate the results of the 
research to study participants or the relevant patient 
community.

participants in UK Biobank who had spent longer in 
full time education were more myopic; that is, they had 
increasingly negative refractive errors (table 1). The 
relation was linear for those leaving full time education 
between the ages of 15 and 18 years, meaning that 
every additional year in education was associated with 
a higher myopic refractive error by −0.25 dioptres/y. 
For those leaving full time education after age 18 
years, the rate slowed to −0.10 dioptres/y (fig 2). On 
average, every additional year spent in education was 
associated with a more myopic refractive error of −0.18 
dioptres/y (95% confidence interval −0.19 to −0.17, 
P<2e-16). The association was largely unaffected 
by adjustment for measured potential confounders, 
including 
socioeconomic 
position 
(Townsend 
deprivation index), birth weight, breast fed, and place 
of birth (northing and easting coordinates; table 1).
Mendelian randomisation analyses: more time 
spent in education causes myopia
Bidirectional mendelian randomisation was used to 
assess the causality and direction of the association 
between time spent in education and refractive 
error. Bidirectional analyses consist of two separate 
mendelian randomisation calculations—one in each 
direction. Firstly, to calculate the causal effect of 
education on myopia we used a weighted education 
allele score as the instrumental variable. Secondly,

to calculate the causal effect of myopia on time spent 
in education we used a weighted myopia allele score 
as the instrumental variable. We derived the allele 
score for time spent in education from genetic variants 
identified by Okbay et al34 in a large meta-analysis of 
GWAS of people of European descent (n=293 723). 
Likewise, we derived the allele score for myopia from 
genetic variants reported by Pickrell et al15 in a GWAS 
of self reported myopia (n=191 843).
The myopia allele score explained 4.32% (F=3155) 
of the variance in average mean spherical equivalent 
refractive error of participants in UK Biobank and the 
education allele score explained 0.71% (F=464) of 
the variance in time spent in education. We selected 
these genetic variants to use as instrumental variables 
because of their robust association with time spent 
in education and myopia, allowing us to construct 
strong aggregate instrumental variables for making 
mendelian randomisation inferences. The large F 
statistics suggested that these analyses would not be 
affected by weak instrument bias.
Thus, using the allele score for time spent in 
education as the instrumental variable, mendelian 
randomisation analysis showed that every additional 
year spent in education resulted in a more myopic 
refractive error of −0.27 dioptres/y (95% confidence 
interval −0.37 to −0.17, P=4e-8) (table 2; fig 3). The 
mendelian randomisation effect estimate was even 
greater in magnitude than the observational estimate 
(−0.27 v −0.18 dioptres) suggesting that unmeasured 
confounders may have attenuated the latter relation. 
Conversely, using the myopia allele score as the 
instrumental variable in mendelian randomisation 
analyses provided little evidence that refractive error 
affected time spent in education (βIV=−0.008 y/dioptre, 
95% confidence interval −0.041 to 0.025, P=0.6) 
(table 2; fig 3). With a sample size of n=69 798, there 
was 80% power to detect an effect of time spent in 
education on refractive error ≥0.14 dioptres/y. In the 
reciprocal direction, there was 80% power to detect an 
effect ≥0.048 y/dioptre (see supplementary figure 1),

detect an effect of myopia on education, if present.
Sensitivity analyses: results of mendelian 
randomisation are robust to potential bias
Confounding
Mendelian randomisation analyses are based on two 
pertinent assumptions: the genetic instrumental 
variables are not associated with any confounders 
of the exposure-outcome relation, and the genetic 
instrumental variables are only associated with the 
outcome through the exposure.
In tests of the association between the allele scores 
for time spent in education and myopia with potential 
confounders, there was evidence that the geographical 
coordinate, northing (measured northward distance 
in UK) was negatively associated with time spent 
in education (β=−1.6e-6, 95% confidence interval 
−1.8e-6 to −1.5e-6) and positively with refractive 
error (β=1.2e-6, 9.8e-7 to 1.3e-6). Northing was also 
associated with the time spent in education (P=7e-5) 
and myopia (P=6e-3) allele scores (see supplementary 
table 2). Compared with standard regression, the 
confounding bias plot suggested that inclusion of 
the northing variable in the instrumental variable 
analysis would result in a greater degree of bias for 
the education allele score but not for the myopia allele 
score (fig 4).
In contrast, the geographical easting coordinate 
was positively associated with time spent in education 
(β=8.9e-7, 95% confidence interval 6.8e-7 to 1.1e-6) 
 
and negatively associated with refractive error 
(β=−1.0e-6, −1.3e-6 to −8.1e-6). It was weakly 
associated with the myopia allele score (P=0.01). 
However, there was little evidence to suggest a greater 
degree of bias in the instrumental variable analysis 
compared with a standard regression with the inclusion 
of the easting variable (fig 4). Sensitivity analyses 
suggested that confounding bias from the geographical 
coordinates had negligible impact on the mendelian 
randomisation results (see supplementary table 4).
One further confounding variable, population 
stratification principal component 9 (PC9), incurred 
a greater degree of bias in the instrumental variable 
regression compared with observational least squares 
regression. Additional analyses showed that PC9 was 
associated with a self reported place of birth in Wales 
(see supplementary figure S2) and also with a −0.17 
dioptre (95% confidence interval −0.05 to −0.28) 
more myopic refractive error, on average (P=4e-3) 
compared with those who reported being born in 
England. A mendelian randomisation sensitivity 
analysis that adjusted for population stratification 
principal components 1-10 provided similar results to 
those before adjustment (see supplementary table 4), 
suggesting that confounding due to PC9 did not lead to 
appreciable bias.
While education legislation has not been different in 
England and Wales while the UK Biobank participants 
were in education, Scottish schools normally finish one 
year earlier and university degrees are correspondingly 
one year longer. This difference would impact on the 
years spent in education for Scottish people moving to 
England to attend university, and vice versa. However, 
the results of a mendelian randomisation sensitivity 
analysis restricted to participants born in England 
were essentially unchanged (see supplementary table 
4), providing evidence that imprecision in quantifying 
years spent in education due to differences in school 
leaving age did not adversely affect the results.
Horizontal (genetic) pleiotropy
Under 
the 
second 
assumption 
of 
mendelian 
randomisation, genetic variants with pleiotropic 
effects are invalid instrumental variables. This can 
be problematic when genetic variants are used 
without regard for the biological mechanisms through 
which they affect the exposure—for example, if 
the genetic variants associated with more years in 
education also caused myopia independently of the 
education phenotype. Mendelian randomisation-
Egger, weighted mode, and weighted median methods 
are alternative methods of integrating instrumental 
variable estimates across individual single nucleotide 
polymorphisms. These methods allow some of the 
assumptions of mendelian randomisation to be 
relaxed providing valid tests for causality despite the 
presence of invalid instrumental variables (eg, due 
to genetic pleiotropy).54 If the results across different 
mendelian randomisation methods are divergent, this 
may indicate that genetic pleiotropy is creating bias. 
However, all methods yielded similar causal estimates 
in magnitude and direction, such that increasing time

spent in education led to a more myopic refractive error 
(by −0.17 to −0.40 dioptres/y), whereas there was 
little evidence that a more myopic refractive error led 
to more time spent in education (see supplementary 
table 3). With mendelian randomisation-Egger, a 
deviation of the intercept estimate from zero suggests 
the existence of genetic pleiotropy—that is, where 
certain genetic variants affect the outcome through a 
different biological pathway from the exposure under 
investigation. In practice, there was little evidence 
that the Egger intercept deviated from zero either 
for more time in education causing refractive error 
(intercept=0.007, SE=0.006, P=0.2) or refractive error 
causing more time in education (intercept=−0.002, 
SE=0.007, P=0.8), indicating that there was little 
evidence for directional genetic pleiotropy.
Measurement error
Encoding time spent in education as a dichotomous 
trait (>16 versus ≤16 years of age when completed full 
time education) produced the same pattern of causality 
as the continuous variable, age at which full time 
education was completed—that is, more time spent in 
education had an effect on refractive error (βIV=−0.35 
dioptres/LOD(education) where LOD is the logarithm 
of odds for having spent >16 versus ≤16 years in 
education, 95% confidence interval −0.48 to −0.22), 
whereas refractive error did not have an effect on time 
spent in education (βIV=−0.0004 LOD(education)/
dioptre, −0.03 to 0.03) (see supplementary table 4).
When those who had attended university or 
college were excluded from the analyses, there was 
a similar point estimate of the effect of time spent in 
education on refractive error (βIV=−0.23 dioptres/y, 
95% confidence interval −0.48 to 0.02, P=0.07) with 
larger standard errors. This was attributable, in part, 
to the reduced sample size (n=45 535). Again, there 
was little evidence that refractive error had an effect 
on time spent in education (βIV=−0.004 y/dioptre, 
95% confidence interval −0.04 to 0.03, P=0.8) (see 
supplementary table 4).
Using the Durbin-Wu-Hausman test for endogeneity, 
we found weak evidence that the instrumental variable 
estimate using the time spent in education allele score 
differed from the observational point estimate (Durbin-
Wu-Hausman P=0.06), with the instrumental variable 
estimate suggesting a larger negative association (table 
2). There was strong evidence that the instrumental 
variable estimate using the myopia allele score was 
a departure from the observational point estimate 
(Durbin-Wu-Hausman P<2e-16; table 2).
discussion
In this study, we found strong evidence that more time 
spent in education is a causal risk factor for myopia. 
More specifically, every additional year in education 
caused an increase in myopic refractive error of −0.27 
dioptres/y (95% confidence interval −0.37 to −0.17, 
P=4e-8). Thus the cumulative effect of more years in 
education on refractive error means that someone 
attending university would be likely to have at least 
−1 dioptre more myopia than someone who left school 
at age 16. A difference of this magnitude would blur 
vision on a Snellen visual acuity chart to 6/18 and 
affect the ability to drive without glasses. Those with 
myopia, by definition, have better near vision than 
distance vision and require less accommodative effort 
for near work and study, and so myopia has been 
proposed as an educational advantage.55 Despite 
the general perception that people with myopia are 
more studious than those without myopia, there was 
little evidence that being myopic resulted in people 
remaining in education for longer.
Strengths and limitations of this study
Mendelian 
randomisation 
is 
a 
particularly 
powerful approach for testing causal hypotheses in 
epidemiology.56 57 The large sample size and robustly 
associated genetic instrumental variables used here 
meant that causal effects could be estimated with high 
precision. Consistent with other studies, the allele score 
for myopia explained only a small fraction (4.32%) 
of the variance in refractive error of participants in 
UK Biobank.20 Likewise, the education allele score 
explained only a small fraction of the variance 
(0.71%) in time spent in education of participants in 
UK Biobank.34 However, power calculations confirmed 
these effects were sufficient to draw solid inferences 
from the results of mendelian randomisation analysis 
presented here (see supplementary figure S1). Given 
the ubiquity of exposure to education in populations 
with available genotype data, it is not possible to 
assess those who were completely free of the outcome, 
specifically education. Nor is it ethical to randomise 
children to different levels of or years in education to 
assess the impact on refractive error. The advantage 
of mendelian randomisation is that participants are 
grouped based on their genotype—randomly allocated 
at conception and so analogous to a randomised 
controlled trial in which genetic variants are used as 
proxies for an environmental exposure to make causal 
inferences about the impact of the exposure on the 
outcome of interest. However, it is not possible to 
determine exactly which components of educational 
practices in the past 5-7 decades have led to increases 
in myopic refraction using mendelian randomisation. 
Although more robust to confounding than standard 
observational studies, mendelian randomisation is 
not entirely immune. There was some evidence of 
confounding by the variables northing and PC9, of 
which the latter identified people from Wales. Although 
there are some differences between the education 
system in England and Wales compared with Scotland, 
the results held true when analyses were restricted to 
people from England. Another limitation of this study 
was selection bias. UK Biobank participants have been 
shown to be more highly educated, have healthier 
lifestyles, and have fewer self reported adverse health 
outcomes than expected compared with the general 
UK population.58 This selection bias could have led 
to bias in both the observational and the mendelian 
randomisation effect estimates.59

When using mendelian randomisation it is not 
necessary to know how the genetic variants used in the 
analysis cause the exposure. Yet, without knowing the 
function of the genetic variants and how they influence 
the traits described here, it is possible that some single 
nucleotide polymorphisms may influence the outcome 
through a pathway that does not involve the exposure—
that is, through horizontal pleiotropy. For example, 
educational outcomes and intelligence are highly 
correlated, and if intelligence caused myopia through 
a pathway that did not involve exposure to education, 
this could cause bias in the mendelian randomisation 
causal effect estimate (see supplementary figure 3a). In 
contrast, vertical pleiotropy refers to single nucleotide 
polymorphisms that influence the outcome through 
an intermediate phenotype—for example, if some 
single nucleotide polymorphisms affect exposure to 
education through their influence on intelligence. 
Vertical 
pleiotropy 
acting 
through 
intelligence 
would not bias the mendelian randomisation causal 
estimate obtained here (see supplementary figure 
3b). Sensitivity analyses (mendelian randomisation-
Egger and mode based mendelian randomisation; 
see supplementary table S3) suggested little evidence 
of unbalanced horizontal pleiotropy in the relation 
between education and myopia, although such bias 
cannot be ruled out unequivocally.
Comparison with other studies
In 
agreement 
with 
a 
substantial 
number 
of 
epidemiological studies dating back more than 100 
years,6 13 30 the observational analyses in this study 
showed that more highly educated participants in UK 
Biobank were more myopic. The results of bidirectional 
mendelian randomisation analyses showed that this 
association arises from exposure to factors related to 
education on myopia. The current epidemic of myopia 
in developed East and South-East Asian countries over 
the past one or two generations seems to coincide 
with widening exposure to primary and secondary 
education, whereas educational outcomes (eg, in 
scientific, reading, and mathematical literacy) are less 
clearly associated with myopia, since many Western 
countries achieve top international rankings in student 
assessments without the same high prevalence rates of 
myopia.60 Moreover, there are countries with poorly 
developed education systems in which the prevalence 
of myopia is low,61-64 and hence any causal relation 
between intelligence and myopia is unlikely. There 
are other well established associations between 
myopia and urbanisation, reduced light exposure, 
socioeconomic position, near work, and prenatal 
factors,21 65-67 and several of these factors either 
confound the relation between education and myopia 
or may work synergistically to exacerbate the effect—
for example, in countries where myopia prevalence 
is particularly high. Despite the robust associations 
between exposure to education and myopia reported 
by many of these previous studies, they have not 
shown causality. Only one study has addressed the 
causal relation between education and myopia: in a 
mendelian randomisation analysis of three cohorts 
of European ancestry (combined n=5649), Cuellar-
Partida et al68 reported that each year of education led 
to a more myopic refractive error of −0.46 dioptres/y 
(P=1e-3). However, the study was under-powered 
and the authors did not investigate the possibility of 
horizontal genetic pleiotropy or reverse causation.68 
Moreover, their methodology risked violating the key 
assumptions of mendelian randomisation because 
they 
used 
several 
thousand 
single 
nucleotide 
polymorphisms (n=17 749) to construct a polygenic 
risk score as an instrumental variable for their 
measure of education. The number of single nucleotide 
polymorphisms used in this previous study means it 
was more likely to include pleiotropic variants with 
direct effects both on exposure to education and on 
refractive error, and single nucleotide polymorphisms 
that are in linkage disequilibrium with refractive 
error variants. The much larger sample size in this 
study permitted the use of a small number of strongly 
associated variants as instrumental variables for 
exposure to education and refractive error. Thus the 
risk of linkage disequilibrium between the major risk 
variants for the two traits explaining the underlying 
associations between education and myopia was 
mitigated. Crucially, the analyses in this study provided 
strong evidence that the relation arose from a causal 
effect of exposure to education on refractive error, 
and not through reverse causation or confounding by 
influences such as socioeconomic position.
Exactly 
how 
increasing 
levels 
of 
education 
cause myopia cannot be inferred from mendelian 
randomisation 
analyses, 
although 
the 
known 
environmental risk factors for myopia provide intriguing 
clues. Children from developed East and South-East 
Asian countries consistently report that they spend less 
time outdoors than children from Australia or the United 
States,25 27 28 69-73 and randomised controlled trials have 
found that time spent outdoors during childhood protects 
against the development of myopia.24 25 Therefore, 
lack of time outdoors is a plausible mediator in the 
causal pathway linking more time spent in education 
and myopia. Furthermore, engaging in higher levels 
of near work activities, such as reading, is associated 
with the incidence and progression of myopia, albeit 
less consistently than time spent outdoors.11 26 73-75 
Yet, measures of time spent on near work activities and 
time spent outdoors are generally uncorrelated.27-29 
Thus, lack of time outdoors and excessive near work 
may not be the only routes mediating the effects of 
exposure to education on myopia. Children with 
myopia tend to engage in less physical activity, such as 
sports, but physical activity in itself does not seem to 
be protective.29 76 Others have correlated higher light 
exposure with lower myopia risk,66 77 and it is possible 
that those who spend more years in education have less 
exposure to natural light. The progression of myopia is 
faster in winter months, thus supporting the hypothesis 
that exposure to natural light is important.78 79 This 
hypothesis has been one of the main drivers for recent 
investment in “bright light classrooms” to protect

against myopia in South-East Asia.80 Whether these 
classrooms provide any protection against myopia that 
replicates the effects of increasing time spent outdoors 
is not currently known as the impact of this intervention 
has not yet been measured. The best recommendation, 
based on the highest quality available evidence at the 
moment, is for children to spend more time outside 
(www.nhs.uk/conditions/short-sightedness/).
Conclusions and policy implications
This study provides strong evidence that more time 
spent in education is a causal risk factor for myopia. 
With the rapid increase in the global prevalence of 
myopia and the economic burden of myopia and its 
vision threatening complications, the findings of this 
study have important implications for educational 
practices. Axial eye growth occurs predominantly 
during the school years81 and since levels of myopia 
tend to stabilise in adulthood23 any interventions 
to halt or prevent myopia need to be delivered in 
childhood. Policy makers should be aware that the 
educational practices used to educate children and to 
promote personal and economic health may have the 
unintended consequence of causing increasing levels 
of myopia and later visual disability.
