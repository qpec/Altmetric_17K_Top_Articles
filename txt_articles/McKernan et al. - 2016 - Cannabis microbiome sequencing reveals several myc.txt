Abstract
The Center for Disease Control estimates 128,000 people in the U.S. are
hospitalized annually due to food borne illnesses. This has created a
demand for food safety testing targeting the detection of pathogenic mold
and bacteria on agricultural products. This risk extends to medical 
 and is of particular concern with inhaled, vaporized and even

concentrated 
products  As a result, third party microbial testing

has become a regulatory requirement in the medical and recreational 
 markets, yet knowledge of the

 Introduction
Our knowledge of the natural microbiome of field-grown Cannabis 
in terms of rhizosphere bacteria, and endophytic fungi is lim-
ited to just a few focused studies1–3. Very little is known about 
the potential for bacterial and fungal contamination on medicinal 
Cannabis. Nevertheless, many states in the U.S. are now crafting 
regulations for detection of microbial contamination on Cannabis 
in the absence of any comprehensive survey of actual samples. 
A few of these regulations are inducing growers to “heat kill” or 
pasteurize Cannabis flowers to lower microbial content. While 
this seems a harmless suggestion, we must remain aware of how 
these drying techniques may create false negatives in culture-based 
safety tests used to monitor colony-forming units (CFU). Even 
though pasteurization may be effective at sterilizing some of the 
microbial content, it does not eliminate various pathogenic toxins 
or spores. Aspergillus spores and mycotoxins are known to resist 
pasteurization4,5. Similar thermal resistance has been reported for 
E. coli produced Shiga toxin6. While pasteurization may reduce 
CFU’s used in petri-dish or plating based safety tests, it does not 
reduce the microbial toxins, spores or DNA encoding these toxins.
Monitoring for mycotoxic fungi in cannabis preparations has been 
recommended as part of routine safety testing by the Cannabis 
Safety Institute. A major driver for this recommendation has been 
numerous reported cases of serious or fatal pulmonary Aspergil-
losis associated with marijuana smoking in immunocompromised 
patients7–9. The major cannabinoids have been shown to be potent 
inhibitors of several cytochrome P450 enzymes at therapeutic 
 
concentrations, including 1A1, 1A2, 1B1 2B6, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4 
and 3A510. Some of these enzymes have been implicated in the 
metabolism of the fungal toxins aflatoxin and ochratoxin11–13. This 
raises questions about potential interactions and appropriate safety 
tolerances for mycotoxins in patients being treated with cannabi-
noid therapeutics. In addition, some Fusarium species that produce 
toxins have proven to be difficult to selectively culture with tailored 
media14–16. This is a common problem associated with culture-based 
systems as carbon sources are not exclusive to certain microbes and 
only 1% of microbial species are believed to be culturable17.
While the risks of mycotoxic fungal contamination have been well 
studied in the food markets, the presence of the fungal popula-
tions present on Cannabis flowers has never been surveyed with 
next generation sequencing techniques18–23. With the publication 
of the Cannabis genome24,25 and many other pathogenic microbial 
genomes, quantitative PCR assays have been developed that can 
accurately quantify fungal DNA present in Cannabis samples26. 
Here, we analyze the yeast and mold species present in 10 real 
world, dispensary-derived Cannabis samples by quantitative PCR 
and sequencing, and demonstrate the presence of several myco-
toxin producing fungal strains that are not detected by widely used 
culture-based assays.
Methods
Culture-based methods
The culture-based methods selected for testing here represent those 
currently in use by established medicinal Cannabis safety test-
ing laboratories. 3.55ml of tryptic soy broth (TSB) was used to 
wet 250mg of homogenized flower in a whirlpack bag. TSB was 
aspirated from the reverse side of the 100μm mesh filter and 
placed into a BiolumixTM growth vial and spread onto a 3M Petri 
FilmTM and a SimPlateTM (3M PetrifilmTM 3M Microbiology, 
St. Paul, MN, USA; SimPlatesTM Biocontrol Systems, Bellevue, 
WA, USA; BioLumixTM Neogen, Lansing MI, USA) according to 
the respective manufacturers’ recommendations. BiolumixTM vials 
were grown and monitored for 48 hours while Petri-filmsTM and 
SimPlatesTM were grown for 5 days. Petri-filmsTM and SimPlatesTM 
were colony counted manually by three independent observers. 
Samples were tested on total coliform, total entero, total aerobic, 
and total yeast and mold. Only total yeast and mold discrepancies 
were graduated to sequencing.
DNA purification
Plant DNA was extracted with SenSATIVAx according to manufac-
turers’ instructions (Medicinal Genomics part #420001). DNA was 
eluted with 50μl ddH20.
Primers used for PCR and sequencing
PCR was performed using 5μl of DNA (3ng/μl) 12.5μl 2X Lon-
gAmp (NEB) with 1.25μl of each 10μM MGC-ITS3 and MGC-ITS3 
primer (MGC-ITS3; TACACGACGTTGTAAAACGACGCATC-
GATGAAGAACGCAGC) and (MGC-ITS3R; AGGATAACAATT-
TCACACAGGATTTGAGCTCTTGCCGCTTCA) with 10μl 
ddH20 for a 25μl total reaction. An initial 95°C 5 minute dena-
turization was performed followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15s 
and 65°C for 90s. Samples were purified with 75μl SenSATIVAx, 
washed twice with 100μl 70% EtOH and bench dried for 5 minutes 
at room temperature. Samples were eluted in 25μl ddH20.
      Amendments from Version 1
The statement in the abstract saying that the findings 
“demonstrate the limitations in the culture-based regulations” 
was removed. We added a brief mention of the limited 
literature relating to Cannabis microbiomes to the introduction. 
Clarification as to the scope of the study including only analysis 
of fungal microbiomes was added. We revised paragraph 2 of 
the introduction to focus on the numerous literature reports of 
pulmonary aspergillosis associated with cannabis use instead of 
potential dangers of mycotoxin toxicity. We provided additional 
background on the overlap of cannabinoid and mycotoxin 
metabolism via cytochrome P450 system. Figure 2 was revised 
and the figure legend expanded. We removed spurious hits to 
non-fungal species and reported only high-confidence species 
detected with 10 reads or more. This resulted in a higher number 
of species reported for some samples and fewer for others. 
The first paragraph of the discussion section was expanded to 
describe the additional findings. We added a sentence to the 
end of the second paragraph of the discussion mentioning the 
two existing publications on endophytic fungi in Cannabis. We 
removed the comment on potential growth inhibition relating to 
terpenoids. With respect to potential paxilline contamination, we 
de-emphasized the concern based solely on the detection of 
P. paxilli, and stated instead that if the results were verified by 
tests indicating high levels of paxilline then it may be a cause for 
concern. The comments relating to the sensitivity of ELISA assays 
were deleted. Some clarification was added to the concluding 
paragraph to emphasize the need to ensure that all species 
of potential concern can be detected, and also the need for 
additional studies to characterize a broader diversity samples, 
including measurements of toxin levels where relevant.

 Total Yeast and Mold assay and ITS amplification
A commercially available total yeast and mold qPCR assay 
(TYM-PathogINDICAtor, Medicinal Genomics, Woburn MA) 
was used to screen for fungal DNA in a background of host 
 
Cannabis DNA. The TYM qPCR assay targets the ribosomal DNA 
Internal Transcribed Spacer region 2 (ITS2) using modified prim-
ers described previously27,28. Fungal DNA amplified using these 
primers may also be subjected to next generation sequencing to 
identify the contributing yeast and mold species. ITS sequencing 
has been widely used to identify and enumerate fungal species 
present in a given sample29.
Tailed PCR cloning and sequencing
DNA libraries were constructed with 250ng DNA using New 
England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA) NEBNext Quick ligation module 
(NEB # E6056S). End repair used 3μl of enzyme mix, 6.5μl of 
reagent mix, 55.5μl of DNA + ddH20. Reaction was incubated 
at 30°C for 20 minutes. After end repair, ligation was performed 
directly with 15μl of blunt end TA mix, 2.5μl of Illumina adap-
tor (10μM) and 1μl of ligation enhancer (assumed to be 20% PEG 
6000). After 15 minute ligation at 25°C, 3μl of USER enzyme was 
added to digest the hairpin adaptors and prepare for PCR. The USER 
enzyme was tip-mixed and incubated at 37°C for 20 minutes. After 
USER digestion, 86.5μl of SenSATIVAx was added and mixed. The 
samples were placed on a magnet for 15 minutes until the beads 
cleared and the supernatant could be removed. Beads were washed 
twice with 150μl of 70% EtOH. Beads were left for 10 minute to air 
dry and then eluted in 25μl of 10mM Tris-HCl.
Library PCR
25μl 2X Q5 polymerase was added to 23μl of DNA with 1μl of 
i7 index primer (25μM) and 1μl universal primer (25μm). After 
an initial 95°C for 10s, the library was amplified for 15 cycles 
of 95°C 10s, 65°C 90s. Samples were purified by mixing 75μl of 
SenSATIVAx into the PCR reaction. The samples were placed on a 
magnet for 15 minutes until the beads cleared and the supernatant 
could be removed. Beads were washed twice with 150μl of 70% 
EtOH. Beads were left for 10 minute to air dry and then eluted 
in 25μl of 10mM Tris-HCl. Samples were prepared for sequencing 
on the MiSeq version 2 chemistry according to the manufacturers’ 
instructions. 2×250bp reads were selected to obtain maximal ITS 
sequence information.
PaxP verification PCR
Primers described by Shirazi-zand et al. were utilized to amplify 
a segment of the 725bp PaxP gene from Penicillium paxilli. 25μl 
LongAmp (NEB) 4μl 10μM primer, 1μl DNA (14ng/μl), 20μl 
ddH20 to make a 50μl PCR reaction. Cycling conditions were 
slightly modified to accommodate a different polymerase. 95°C 
for 30s followed by 28 cycles of 95°C 15s, 55°C for 30s, 65°C 
2.5 minutes. Samples were purified with 50μl of SenSATIVAx as 
described above. 1μl of purified PCR product was sized on Agilent 
HS 2000 chip. Nextera libraries and sequencing were performed 
according to instructions from Illumina using 2×75bp sequencing 
on a version 2 MiSeq.
Penicillium Citrinum verification PCR
Citrinum forward GATTTTCCAAAATGCCGTCT and Citrinum 
reverse GCTCAAGCATTAATCTAGCTA primers were used with 
identical PCR conditions as above with the exception using 35 cycles 
 
of PCR. Samples were purified with 50μl of SenSATIVAx as 
described above. 1μl of purified PCR product was sized on Agilent 
HS 2000 chip. Nextera libraries and sequencing were performed 
according to instructions from Illumina using 2×75bp sequencing 
on a version 2 MiSeq. Reads were mapped to Genbank accession 
number LKUP01000000. Mappings were confirmed using BLAST to 
NCBI to ensure the strongest hits were to P. citrinum.
Analysis
Reads were demultiplexed and trimmed with Casava 1.8.2 and trim_
galore v0.4.1 (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/
trim_galore/). FLASH v1.2.1130 was used to merge the reads using 
max_overlap 150. The reads were aligned to microbial references 
using MG-RAST v3.231. Alignments and classifications were con-
firmed with a second software tool from One Codex (https://one-
codex.com/) and critical pathways identified for further evaluation 
with PCR of toxin producing genes. Reads are deposited in NCBI 
under SRA accession: SRP065410. Nextera 2×75bp sequencing 
of the PaxP gene was mapped to accession number HM171111.1 
with CLCbio Workstation V4 at 98% identity over 80% of the read.

 Results
We purified DNA from Cannabis samples obtained from two 
different geographic regions (Amsterdam and Massachusetts) 
 
several years apart (2011 and 2015). The majority of samples puri-
fied and screened with ITS qPCR were negative for amplification 
signal implying reagents clean of fungal contamination. Six of 
the 17 dispensary-derived Cannabis samples tested positive for 
yeast and mold in the TYM qPCR assay. These results were com-
pared with the results derived from three commercially available 
culture-based detection systems for each of the 17 samples (3M 
PetrifilmTM 3M Microbiology, St. Paul, MN, USA; SimPlatesTM 
Biocontrol Systems, Bellevue, WA, USA; BioLumixTM Neogen, 
Lansing MI, USA; Figure 1). Of the 6 qPCR positive samples, 
two tested negative in all 3 culture-based assays and four tested 
negative in 1 or 2 of the culture-based assays (Table 1). None of 
the qPCR negative samples tested positive in any of the culture-
based assays. Each of the 6 discordant samples was subjected to 
ITS sequencing to precisely identify the collection of microbes 
present. Four additional samples from a different geographic ori-
gin (Amsterdam) were also subjected to ITS sequencing, for a 
total of 10 Cannabis samples.
Each discordant sample presented with an array of micro-
bial species, as shown in Figure 2. No sample presented with 
a single dominant species, and each sample displayed multiple 
 
species of interest. Of particular concern were the identified 
DNA sequences from toxin producing species: Aspergillus 
 
versicolor32–36, Aspergillus terreus37, Penicillium citrinum38–40, 
Penicillium paxilli41,42.
We further analyzed the ITS sequence alignments using the whole 
genome shotgun based microbiome classification software known as 
One Codex43. Nine of the ten samples sequenced showed the pres-
ence of P. paxilli (Figure 3). To verify the accuracy of this ITS phylo-
typing, a gene involved in the paxilline toxin biosynthesis pathway of 
P. paxilli was amplified with PaxPss1 and PaxPss2 primers described 
by Saikia et al.44. The resulting 725bp amplicon (expected size) was 
sequenced to confirm the presence of the P. paxilli biosynthesis gene in 
the Cannabis sample KD8 (Figure 4). This was successfully repeated 
with primers designed to target genes in the citrinin pathway of 
 
P. citrinum. There were some discrepancies between the results 
derived from the two software platforms (One Codex and MG-RAST). 
The MG-RAST analysis, using merged, paired reads correlated bet-
ter with the PCR results. While One Codex predicted and confirmed 
KD8 as having the highest P. paxilli content, the One Codex platform 
is optimized for whole genome shotgun data and may not be able to 
differentiate the 18S sequence differences (391/412 aligned bases) 
between these two species with a K-mer based approach.
With the confirmed presence of P. paxilli, we are curious to find out 
whether the toxin, paxilline, is present in the samples. Development 
of monoclonal antibodies to paxilline has recently been described45, 
but commercial ELISA assays with sensitivity under 50ppb do not 
appear to be available at this time. A >50ppb multiplexed ELISA 
assay is available from Randox Food Diagnostics (Crumlin, UK). 
Detection with LC-MS/MS has also been described46,47, however, 
and experiments are underway to determine whether paxilline 
can be identified in the background of cannabinoids and terpenes 
present in Cannabis samples.

 Table 1. Samples were cultured with 3 different techniques and compared to 
quantitative PCR (qPCR). Biolumix had the lowest sensitivity failing to pick up 4/17 
samples detected with other culture-based platforms. qPCR identified 2 samples that were 
not picked up by any other method. Positive qPCR samples were sequenced to identify the 
contributing signal. Highlighted samples fail the 10,000 CFU/g cutoffs which equates to a 
Cq of 26 on the qPCR assay according to the manufacturers’ instructions. (f) is fail or over 
10,000 CFU/g. (p) is pass or under 10,000 CFU/g. The raw CFU numbers can be deduced 
by dividing the CFU number by the 1,000 fold dilution factor used in this study.

 Figure 3. One Codex classification of ITS reads. P. paxilli is the most frequently found contaminant in Cannabis flowers. P. citrinum is not 
in the One Codex database at this time. One Codex utilizes a fast k-mer based approach for whole genome shotgun classification and can 
be influenced by read trimming and database content. The reads provided to MG-RAST were trimmed and FLASH’d (paired end reads 
merged when overlapping) prior to classification. K-mer based approaches can significantly differ from longer word size methods and this 
underscores the importance of confirmatory PCR in microbiome analysis.

 Figure 4. PCR of genes encoding Paxilline and Citrinin demonstrates amplification of the expected size. Citrinum primers we designed 
from Genbank accession number LKUP01000753. Paxilline primers were used as described in Saikia et al. PCR products were made into 
shotgun libraries with Nextera and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq with 2×75bp reads to over 10,000X coverage. Reads were mapped with 
CLCbio 4 to NCBI accession number HM171111.1 (A) and LKUP01000000 respectively (B). Paired reads are displayed as blue lines, green 
and red lines are unpaired reads. Read coverage over the amplicons are depicted in a blue histogram over the cluster while paired end read 
distance is measured in a red histogram over the region. Off target read mapping is limited. P. paxilli mappings are displayed on top (A) and 
P. citrinum mappings are displayed on bottom (B). Alignment of PCR primers to P. paxilli reference shows a 5 prime mismatch that is a result 
of the primers being designed to target spliced RNA according to Saikia et al.

 Discussion
This study demonstrates detection of numerous fungal species 
by molecular screening of ITS2 in several dispensary-derived 
 
Cannabis samples. These included the toxigenic Penicillium 
species: P. paxilli, P. citrinum, P. commune, P. chrysogenum, 
 
P. corylophilum, Aspergillus species: A. terreus, A. niger, A. flavus, 
A. versicolor and Eurotium repens. In addition, a pathogenic species 
Cryptococcus liquefaciens was detected. The fungal microbiomes 
of the different samples differed significantly in the number and 
diversity of species present. Two samples contained a large diver-
sity of species, similar to previous studies that used field-grown 
samples and culture-based outgrowth methods2,3,48. Other samples 
contained only a few species at significant levels. This is perhaps 
not surprising given the prevalence of indoor culture methods using 
artificial growth media for medicinal Cannabis. However, we do 
not have any knowledge of the specific growth conditions that were 
used for the samples analyzed.
Three different culture-based assays failed to detect all of the 
positive samples and one, BioLumixTM, detected only one out of 7 
positive samples. A review of the literature suggests that 
 
Penicillium microbes can be cultured on CYA media, but some may 
require colder temperatures (21-24C) and 7 day growth times49. 
Of the Penicillium, only P. citrinum has been previously reported 
to culture with 3M Petri-Film50. It is possible the different water 
activity of the culture assay compared to the natural flower 
 
environment is contributing to the false negative test results.
Quantitative PCR is agnostic to water activity and can be performed 
in hours instead of days. The specificity and sensitivity provides 
important information on samples that present risks invisible to 
culture based systems. The drawback to qPCR is the method’s 
indifference to living or non-living DNA. While techniques exist to 
perform live-dead qPCR, the live status of the microbes is unrelated 
to toxin potentially produced while the microbes were alive. ELISA 
assays exist to screen for some toxins51. Current state-recommended 
ELISA’s do not detect citrinin or paxilline, the toxins produced by 
P. citrinum and P. paxilli, respectively. The predominance of these 
Penicillium species in a majority of the samples tested is interesting. 
Several Penicillium species are known to be endophytes on various 
plant species, including P. citrinum18, and this raises the question 
of whether they may be common Cannabis endophytes. Indeed, 
P. citrinum and a species identified as P. copticola (a member of 
the citrinun section51) have previously been identified as Cannabis 
endophytes, along with several Aspergillus species2,3.
Paxilline is a tremorgenic and ataxic potassium channel blocker 
and has been shown to attenuate the anti-seizure properties of 
cannabidiol in certain mouse models52–54. Paxilline is reported to 
have tremorgenic effects at nanomolar concentrations and is respon-
sible for Ryegrass-staggers disease55. Cannabidiol is often used at 
micromolar concentrations for seizure reduction and contamination 
with paxilline, if confirmed, would be a cause for concern. Citrinin 
is a mycotoxin that disrupts Ca2+ efflux in the mitochondrial 
permeability transition pore (mPTP)56–63. Ryan et al. demonstrated 
that cannabidiol affects this pathway suggesting a similar potential 
cause for concern regarding CBD-citrinin interaction64. Considering 
the hydrophobicity of these mycotoxins and the growing interest 
in the use of extracted oils from CBD-rich Cannabis strains for 
treatment of drug resistant epilepsy65–70, more precise molecular 
screening of fungal toxins in these products might be warranted.
ITS amplification and sequencing offers a hypothesis-free test-
ing approach that can be employed to identify a broad range of 
fungal species present in a given sample. Appropriate primer design 
can survey a broad spectrum of fungal genomes while affording 
rapid iteration of design. Quantitative PCR has also demonstrated 
single molecule sensitivity and linear dynamic range over 5 orders 
of magnitude offering a very sensitive approach for detection of 
microbial risks. Our survey of Cannabis flowers in this study was 
limited, however. Further studies are required to survey a broader 
range of samples, and to determine whether paxilline, citrinin, afla-
toxin or ochratoxin can be detected at concentrations that represent 
a clinical risk in Cannabis samples or extracts derived from plants 
that test positive for the fungi known to produce those toxins.
Conclusions
Several toxigenic fungi were detected in dispensary-derived 
Cannabis samples using molecular amplification and sequencing 
techniques. These microbes were not detected using traditional 
culture-based platforms. These results suggest that culture based 
techniques borrowed from the food industry should be re-evaluated 
for Cannabis testing to ensure that they are capable of detecting 
the prevalent species detected by molecular methods with adequate 
sensitivity. We recommend that additional sequencing studies be 
performed to characterize the fungal and bacterial microbiomes 
of a more diverse selection of Cannabis samples. Such sampling 
should include dispensary-derived samples from both indoor 
and outdoor crops, as well as samples from police seizures from 
well-provenanced foreign sources, such as Mexico. Finally, further 
studies should be performed to measure toxin levels in strains that 
test positive for toxigenic species.

The authors have adequately addressed most of my concerns with the exception of the issue of
re-evaluating the standard methods used for establishing food safety thresholds as applied to cannabis.  
The problem is with the use of the word "re-evaluate".  The authors are suggesting that the negative
results they obtained using cell culture-based platforms in samples that were positive using their more
sensitive molecular amplification indicate a possible limitation of standard methods as applied to
cannabis. This may or may not be true. The concern I have is whether their technique is overly sensitive
based on current limits used in the food industry. It may be that use of molecular DNA amplification
methods indicate the presence of several toxigenic species of fungi and other pathogens in food but at
such low levels that standard culture-based methods would not detect them. In this case there would be
no need to re-evaluate the use of standard methods that establish safety thresholds. In short, without
some type of calibration between the author's technique and traditional methods there is no way of
knowing whether their sensitivity is too high or traditional methods used in the food industry are somehow
not capable of detecting pathogens in cannabis preparations and therefore need to be "re-evaluated".
 No competing interests were disclosed.

I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that
it is of an acceptable scientific standard.

The manuscript is well written and appropriate as an article in F1000 Research. The abstract states that
their findings, "demonstrate the limitations in the culture-based regulations", but this conclusion does not
follow from their data. In fact, their results show that their DNA based method is overly sensitive at
detecting potential pathogens. Whether culture-based regulations are appropriate or not would have to be
validated and tested directly, not simply inferred from the presence of microbial DNA. The authors should
remove this cautionary sentence in the abstract and throughout the manuscript until it has been validated.
This would make the manuscript more balanced and justified.
A better understanding of the microbiome and mycobiome in cannabis is an important endeavor in part,
because recent work on the human microbiome has revealed that microbial constituents of the
microbiome and fungi interact cooperatively and non cooperatively to influence human health. Recently
studies focused on the human gut mycobiome have been performed using deep sequencing of the ITS1
region for identification of fungi in fecal samples from healthy individuals and the researchers identified
184 fungal species in total. Human oral and lung tissues testing indicate the presence of Aspergillus,
, and 
in healthy individuals. An emerging theme from this new field of
Cryptococcus, Fusarium
Alternaria 
study indicates complex microbial communities distributed across the body that fundamentally contribute
to the development, physiology and metabolic homeostasis of the macro-organism. The same is likely
true in plants, like cannabis. Because of this beneficial dynamic interplay between microbes and hosts a
complete absence of amplified DNA or RNA microbial markers would be unexpected. The question is,
“What levels are safe?” and the answer to this question has not been established.
From a consumer safety perspective the rationale for microbial testing in food and pharmaceuticals is to
prevent infection of highly toxigenic microbes that grow readily and are consumed in rather large
quantities. For example, 
 infects grain in as much as 30% of Sub-Saharan African maize
Aspergillus flavus
and the Aflatoxin regulatory limit for maize is 10 ppb because in this region maize is consumed in kilogram
quantities on a daily basis. The risk of health hazard to individuals arising from microbial toxins or
mycotoxins is largely proportional to the consumption amounts and frequency. Compared to other
regulated foods or tobacco it is expected that the level of cannabis consumption would be minimal and
would therefore present minimal risk, nevertheless, there is burgeoning interest in putting in place
regulatory requirements for medical and recreational Cannabis in some markets.  
In this present study the authors use state-of-the art technology to identify DNA-based markers
associated with a variety of microbes and, as expected, some are pathogenic. The authors state that
“Mycotoxin monitoring in Cannabis preparations is important since aflatoxin produced by Aspergillus
species is a carcinogen.”, but there is no actual data showing that the strain of 
 they identify is
Aspergillus
toxigenic. 
 is a common fungus that is found in the human mycobiome in oral, lung,
Aspergillus
gastrointestinal tract. Detection of 
markers in minute quantities alone is not necessarily a
Aspergillus 
health concern unless it is also coincident with live cells that can grow readily and secrete toxin that are

based on comparison to their highly sensitive DNA based detection. Their results using standard
regulatory methods, for the most part, would not indicate a food safety problem. The authors should add
this emphasis. The authors correctly identify a limitation of their study in that the qPCR based testing has
an “indifference to living or non-living DNA” and because of this their PCR based approach may be
unnecessarily sensitive. To date there are little to no guidelines for thresholds on many mycotoxins or
bacterial toxins that have been established in the cannabis industry, so their findings help inform
regulators as to which type of toxins might be relevant for further analysis. 
The authors state, ”Health compromised patients exposed to aflatoxin and clearance-inhibiting
cannabinoids raise new questions in regards to the current safety tolerances to aflatoxin.” but the authors
present no data showing the presence of aflatoxin in any of their samples. So their caution is highly
speculative and they should indicate that unless they provide data supporting their caution.  
As mentioned above, dynamic homeostatic processes limit the growth of microbes and fungi in living
organisms and the authors point out that “several studies have demonstrated plant phytochemicals and
terpenoids like eugenol can inhibit the growth of fungi. It is possible the different water activity of the
culture assay compared to the natural terpene rich flower environment is contributing to the false negative
test results.”  but these phytochemicals may also prevent the growth of fungi and bacteria in the plant
despite the presence of microbial DNA. 
Furthermore they state that “While techniques exist to perform live-dead qPCR, the live status of the
microbes is unrelated to toxin potentially produced while the microbes were alive. ELISA assays exist to
screen for some toxins. Current state-recommended ELISA’s do not detect citrinin or paxilline, the toxins
produced by P. citrinum and P. paxilli, respectively. The predominance of these Penicillium species in a
majority of the samples tested is interesting.” Ideally the authors would test for these toxins in their most
positive samples.
The authors state that, “Cannabidiol is often used at micromolar concentrations for seizure reduction
implying sub-percentage contamination of paxilline could still be a concern” but this is highly speculative
and the authors should de-emphasize the “concern” and state instead that if their results were verified by
tests indicating high levels of paxilline then it may be cause for concern. The same is true for their concern
about Citrinin and aflatoxin and the authors should state this. 
The authors state, “While ELISA assays are easy point of use tests that can be used to detect fungal
toxins, they can suffer from lack of sensitivity and cross reactivity. ITS amplification and sequencing offers
hypothesis-free testing that can complement the lack of specificity in ELISA assays.” ELISA and rapid
diagnostic lateral flow tests are standard in the food safety industry for measuring toxins. I see no need to
call into question protein based ELISA methods without even testing them in the first place. All diagnostic
tests have sensitivity and selectivity limitations which is why they need to be tested and verified using
other analytical methods. 
The authors state that “Appropriate primer design can survey a broad spectrum of microbial genomes
while affording rapid iteration of design. Quantitative PCR has also demonstrated single molecule
sensitivity and linear dynamic range over 5 orders of magnitude offering a very robust approach for
detection of microbial risks. This may be important for the detection of nanomolar potency mycotoxins”.
The ability to detect single copies of genes makes their system highly sensitive, but does not indicate
level of mycotoxin. The authors should point out the limitations of their approach and discuss the
possibility that it would likely generate a high degree of false positive results compared to culture-based
standard methods.

The authors state, “These results demonstrate that culture based techniques superimposed from the food
industry should be re-evaluated based on the known microbiome of actual Cannabis flowers in circulation
at dispensaries.”  This statement appears to be too strong in light of their data. Without validation for the
presence of toxins above a safety threshold there is no need to re-evaluate the standard methods in the
food industry.

The manuscript is well written and appropriate as an article in F1000 Research. The abstract states
that their findings, "demonstrate the limitations in the culture-based regulations", but this
conclusion does not follow from their data. In fact, their results show that their DNA based method
is overly sensitive at detecting potential pathogens. Whether culture-based regulations are
appropriate or not would have to be validated and tested directly, not simply inferred from the
presence of microbial DNA. The authors should remove this cautionary sentence in the abstract
and throughout the manuscript until it has been validated. This would make the manuscript more
balanced and justified.
 
Author response: The last sentence of the abstract was revised to read: Here we describe the first
next generation sequencing survey of the fungal communities found in dispensary based Cannabis
flowers by ITS2 sequencing, and demonstrate the sensitive detection of several toxigenic 
and 
species, including 
that were not detected by
Penicillium 
Aspergillus 
P. citrinum and P. paxilli, 
one or more culture-based methods currently in use for safety testing.
A better understanding of the microbiome and mycobiome in cannabis is an important endeavor in
part, because recent work on the human microbiome has revealed that microbial constituents of
the microbiome and fungi interact cooperatively and non cooperatively to influence human health.
Recently studies focused on the human gut mycobiome have been performed using deep
sequencing of the ITS1 region for identification of fungi in fecal samples from healthy individuals
and the researchers identified 184 fungal species in total. Human oral and lung tissues testing
indicate the presence of Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, Fusarium, and Alternaria in healthy individuals.
An emerging theme from this new field of study indicates complex microbial communities
distributed across the body that fundamentally contribute to the development, physiology and
metabolic homeostasis of the macro-organism. The same is likely true in plants, like cannabis.
Because of this beneficial dynamic interplay between microbes and hosts a complete absence of
amplified DNA or RNA microbial markers would be unexpected. The question is, “What levels are
safe?” and the answer to this question has not been established.
From a consumer safety perspective the rationale for microbial testing in food and pharmaceuticals
is to prevent infection of highly toxigenic microbes that grow readily and are consumed in rather
large quantities. For example, Aspergillus flavusinfects grain in as much as 30% of Sub-Saharan
African maize and the Aflatoxin regulatory limit for maize is 10 ppb because in this region maize is
consumed in kilogram quantities on a daily basis. The risk of health hazard to individuals arising

consumed in kilogram quantities on a daily basis. The risk of health hazard to individuals arising
from microbial toxins or mycotoxins is largely proportional to the consumption amounts and
frequency. Compared to other regulated foods or tobacco it is expected that the level of cannabis
consumption would be minimal and would therefore present minimal risk, nevertheless, there is
burgeoning interest in putting in place regulatory requirements for medical and recreational
Cannabis in some markets.  
In this present study the authors use state-of-the art technology to identify DNA-based markers
associated with a variety of microbes and, as expected, some are pathogenic. The authors state
that “Mycotoxin monitoring in Cannabis preparations is important since aflatoxin produced
by Aspergillus species is a carcinogen.”, but there is no actual data showing that the strain
of Aspergillus they identify is toxigenic. Aspergillus is a common fungus that is found in the human
mycobiome in oral, lung, gastrointestinal tract. Detection of Aspergillus markers in minute
quantities alone is not necessarily a health concern unless it is also coincident with live cells that
can grow readily and secrete toxin that are above some threshold or there is an imbalance in
homeostatic growth limiting factors. The authors call into question culture-based testing, which is
the standard in Food safety and USP regulatory guidelines based on comparison to their highly
sensitive DNA based detection. Their results using standard regulatory methods, for the most part,
would not indicate a food safety problem. The authors should add this emphasis. The authors
correctly identify a limitation of their study in that the qPCR based testing has an “indifference to
living or non-living DNA” and because of this their PCR based approach may be unnecessarily
sensitive. To date there are little to no guidelines for thresholds on many mycotoxins or bacterial
toxins that have been established in the cannabis industry, so their findings help inform regulators
as to which type of toxins might be relevant for further analysis. 
The authors state, ”Health compromised patients exposed to aflatoxin and clearance-inhibiting
cannabinoids raise new questions in regards to the current safety tolerances to aflatoxin.” but the
authors present no data showing the presence of aflatoxin in any of their samples. So their caution
is highly speculative and they should indicate that unless they provide data supporting their
caution.  
 
Author response: We thank the reviewer for the background and context provided to his concern.
The questions about what levels of toxins are safe or acceptable fall well beyond the scope of the
present study.  We concede, however, that some statements made in the introduction may have
been too speculative.  We have revised paragraph 2 of the introduction to focus on the numerous
literature reports of pulmonary aspergillosis associated with cannabis use instead of potential
mycotoxin toxicity. We have also provided more background on the overlap of cannabinoid and
mycotoxin metabolism via cytochrome P450 system as follows.  Monitoring for mycotoxic fungi in
cannabis preparations has been recommended as part of routine safety testing by the Cannabis
Safety Institute. A major driver for this recommendation has been numerous reported cases of
serious or fatal pulmonary Aspergillosis associated with marijuana smoking in
immunocompromised patients
. The major cannabinoids have been shown to be potent
inhibitors of several cytochrome P450 enzymes at therapeutic concentrations, including 1A1, 1A2,
1B1 2B6, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4 and 3A5 . Some of these enzymes have been implicated in the
metabolism of the fungal toxins aflatoxin and ochratoxin
. This raises questions about potential
interactions and appropriate safety tolerances for mycotoxins in patients being treated with
cannabinoid therapeutics. In addition, some 
 species that produce toxins have proven to
Fusarium
be difficult to selectively culture with tailored media 
 . This is a common problem associated
with culture-based systems as carbon sources are not exclusive to certain microbes and only 1%
of microbial species are believed to be culturable  .

of microbial species are believed to be culturable  .
 
The first sentence of the next paragraph was edited slightly to follow more logically:  While the risks
of mycotoxic fungal contamination have been well studied in the food markets, the presence of the
fungal populations present on 
 flowers has never been surveyed with next generation
Cannabis
sequencing techniques 
 .
As mentioned above, dynamic homeostatic processes limit the growth of microbes and fungi in
living organisms and the authors point out that “several studies have demonstrated plant
phytochemicals and terpenoids like eugenol can inhibit the growth of fungi. It is possible the
different water activity of the culture assay compared to the natural terpene rich flower environment
is contributing to the false negative test results.”  but these phytochemicals may also prevent the
growth of fungi and bacteria in the plant despite the presence of microbial DNA. 
 
Author response: Upon reconsideration, we concluded that there is no way to predict how growth
of the specific fungi detected might be affected by the terpenoids in Cannabis flowers. Those
compounds may inhibit the growth of some fungi, while permitting the growth of others. In any
case, the effect of terpenes would not relevant to the ability of the fungi to grow on culture media
lacking those compounds. That sentence was deleted and the last sentence of paragraph 1 in the
discussion was edited as follows:  It is possible the different water activity of the culture assay
compared to the natural flower environment is contributing to the false negative test results.
Furthermore they state that “While techniques exist to perform live-dead qPCR, the live status of
the microbes is unrelated to toxin potentially produced while the microbes were alive. ELISA
assays exist to screen for some toxins. Current state-recommended ELISA’s do not detect citrinin
or paxilline, the toxins produced by P. citrinum and P. paxilli, respectively. The predominance of
these Penicillium species in a majority of the samples tested is interesting.” Ideally the authors
would test for these toxins in their most positive samples.
 
Author response: We stated transparently that this needed to be done as a future direction. We
don’t see it as an essential part of the current publication, which had the goal of simply cataloging
the fungal content of dispensary-derived samples.
The authors state that, “Cannabidiol is often used at micromolar concentrations for seizure
reduction implying sub-percentage contamination of paxilline could still be a concern” but this is
highly speculative and the authors should de-emphasize the “concern” and state instead that if
their results were verified by tests indicating high levels of paxilline then it may be cause for
concern. The same is true for their concern about Citrinin and aflatoxin and the authors should
state this. 
We agree. Paragraph 3 of the discussion was edited to address this criticism as follows:  Paxilline
is a tremorgenic and ataxic potassium channel blocker and has been shown to attenuate the
anti-seizure properties of cannabidiol in certain mouse models 
 . Paxilline is reported to have
tremorgenic effects at nanomolar concentrations and is responsible for Ryegrass-staggers disease
 . Cannabidiol is often used at micromolar concentrations for seizure reduction and
contamination with paxilline, if confirmed, would be a cause for concern. Citrinin is a mycotoxin that
disrupts Ca2+ efflux in the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) 
 . Ryan et al.
demonstrated that cannabidiol affects this pathway suggesting a similar potential cause for
concern regarding CBD-citrinin interaction 
 . Considering the hydrophobicity of these mycotoxins

and the growing interest in the use of extracted oils from CBD-rich Cannabis strains for treatment
of drug resistant epilepsy
, more precise molecular screening of fungal toxins in these
products might be warranted.
The authors state, “While ELISA assays are easy point of use tests that can be used to detect
fungal toxins, they can suffer from lack of sensitivity and cross reactivity. ITS amplification and
sequencing offers hypothesis-free testing that can complement the lack of specificity in ELISA
assays.” ELISA and rapid diagnostic lateral flow tests are standard in the food safety industry for

potency mycotoxins”. The ability to detect single copies of genes makes their system highly
sensitive, but does not indicate level of mycotoxin. The authors should point out the limitations of
their approach and discuss the possibility that it would likely generate a high degree of false
positive results compared to culture-based standard methods. 
Author response: The comments about ELISA assays was deleted and the paragraph was edited
to focus on detection of fungal species, not toxins, as follows.  ITS amplification and sequencing
offers a hypothesis-free testing approach that can be employed to identify a broad range of fungal
species present in a given sample. Appropriate primer design can survey a broad spectrum of
fungal genomes while affording rapid iteration of design. Quantitative PCR has also demonstrated
single molecule sensitivity and linear dynamic range over 5 orders of magnitude offering a very
sensitive approach for detection of microbial risks. Our survey of 
 flowers in this study
Cannabis
was limited, however. Further studies are required to survey a broader range of samples, and to
determine whether paxilline, citrinin, aflatoxin or ochratoxin can be detected at concentrations that
represent a clinical risk in 
 samples or extracts derived from plants that test positive for
Cannabis
the fungi known to produce those toxins.
The authors state, “These results demonstrate that culture based techniques superimposed from
the food industry should be re-evaluated based on the known microbiome of actual Cannabis
flowers in circulation at dispensaries.”  This statement appears to be too strong in light of their data.
Without validation for the presence of toxins above a safety threshold there is no need to
re-evaluate the standard methods in the food industry.
Author response: We respectfully disagree with this comment of the reviewer. The sentence was
taken out of context.  We were not trying to suggest that the standard methods in use in the food
industry should be re-evaluated for all applications, only the use of those methods for medicinal 
 testing. The Conclusions paragraph was modified to clarify as follows. Several toxigenic
Cannabis
fungi were detected in dispensary-derived 
 samples using molecular amplification and
Cannabis
sequencing techniques. These microbes were not detected using traditional culture-based
platforms. These results suggest that culture based techniques borrowed from the food industry
should be re-evaluated for 
 testing to ensure that they are capable of detecting the
Cannabis
prevalent species detected by molecular methods with adequate sensitivity. We recommend that
additional sequencing studies be performed to characterize the fungal and bacterial microbiomes
of a more diverse selection of 
samples. Such sampling should include

of a more diverse selection of 
samples. Such sampling should include
Cannabis 
dispensary-derived samples from both indoor and outdoor crops, as well as samples from police
seizures from well-provenanced foreign sources, such as Mexico. Finally, further studies should be
performed to measure toxin levels in strains that test positive for toxigenic species.

Five critiques:
1. “Microbiome” appears in the manuscript’s title, so you should cite some literature regarding plant
microbiomes in general, as well as 
-specific research. Vorholt (2012) and Turner 
 (2013)
Cannabis
et al.
provide general overviews. 
-specific microbiome studies (Kusari 
 2013, Gautam 
 2013)
Cannabis
et al.
et al.
generated very different results than yours, and should be discussed. The rhizosphere study by Winston 
 (2014) ought to be mentioned, and highlight the complimentary nature of rhizosphere and
et al.
phyllosphere studies.
      The foliar microbiome (
, phyllosphere, as opposed to rhizosphere) can be partitioned into two
aka
groups: 
 live upon the leaf epidermis, and 
 occupy intercellular spaces within the
epiphytes
endophytes
leaf. Culture-based detection systems normally surface-sterilize plant samples, so they assume that
cultured organisms are endophytes. NextGen and qPCR should identify both epiphytes and endophytes.
Classic epiphytes identified in your study include 
 and 
Kabatiella (Aureobasidium) microsticta
Sarocladium
.
(Acremonium) strictum
      Phyllosphere organisms may be plant pathogens, and cause disease symptoms; diseased plants
should never reach a dispensary. However, phyllosphere organisms may act as symbionts (good for the
plant) or commensals (indifferent), and their asymptomatic presence is not easily detected. Nevertheless
these cryptic organisms may cause disease in humans. The spores from phyllosphere fungi readily pass
through waterpipes (Moody 
 1982), and survive in smoke drawn from cannabis cigarettes (Kurup 
et al.
et
1983), as do aflatoxins (Llewellyn and O'Rear 1977). Worth mentioning.

2. Explain the methodology used to select three culture-based detection systems in this study. Are they
the most widely-used systems? Are they the systems recommended by cannabis regulatory agencies? If
the method was simply “convenience sampling,” say so.

3. Methods used in the qPCR ITS assay should be described in the Methods section, not the Results
section.
 
4. Figure 2, “DNA sequencing of ITS2 amplicons from culture negative samples that are qPCR positive for
total yeast and mold tests,” deserves some comment. Some of the taxa are not yeasts or molds. They

and an “uncultured bacterium.” Comment please.
 
5. This study revealed a surprisingly depauperate 
 foliar microbiome, compared to a recent
Cannabis
study of 
 species, using similar methods, that identified 92 genera of organisms (Cao 
Genlisea
et al.
2015). See Delmotte 
 (2009) for rich microbiomes in other plant species. Gzebenyuk (1984) isolated

79 species of fungi from hemp stems in Russia. Comment please.
      Where are the bacteria? Much of the concern over microbiology and food safety focuses on human
enteric pathogens (
 spp.) and opportunistic bacteria (
e.g., Escherichia coli, Salmonella
e.g., Pseudomonas
). Previous culture-based studies have isolated these organisms from 
aeruginosa, Berkholderia cepacia
 (
 Taylor 
 1982, Ungerleider 
1982). The only bacterium you identify (in Figure 2,

formerly known as 
Pantoea agglomerans,

the abstract of the paper! An exhaustive review of the 
 literature (McPartland

Recommend some future directions: a comparison of indoor crops and outdoor crops (outdoor
crops may show a seasonal community succession), and survey the microbiome of police seizures
from well-provenanced foreign sources, such as Mexico.

Worth mentioning.
 
Author response: Several of the references cited relate to analysis of the bacterial
microbiome on diverse plant species, which falls well beyond the scope of this study
(focusing on the fungal microbiome of 
).  However, we added a brief mention of
Cannabis
the very limited literature relating to Cannabis microbiomes to the introduction as follows:
"Our knowledge of the natural microbiome of field-grown 
in terms of rhizosphere
Cannabis 
bacteria, and endophytic fungi is limited to just a few focused studies
. Very little is known about
the potential for bacterial and fungal contamination on medicinal 
. Nevertheless, many
Cannabis
states in the U.S. are now crafting regulations for detection of microbial contamination on Cannabis
in the absence of any comprehensive survey of actual samples. A few of these regulations are
inducing growers to “heat kill” or pasteurize 
 flowers to lower microbial content. While this
Cannabis
seems a harmless suggestion, we must remain aware of how these drying techniques may create
false negatives in culture-based safety tests used to monitor colony-forming units (CFU). Even
though pasteurization may be effective at sterilizing some of the microbial content, it does not
eliminate various pathogenic toxins or spores. 
 spores and mycotoxins are known to
Aspergillus
resist pasteurization 
 . Similar thermal resistance has been reported for 
 produced Shiga
E. coli
toxin  . While pasteurization may reduce CFU’s used in petri-dish or plating based safety tests, it
does not reduce the microbial toxins, spores or DNA encoding these toxins."
Author response: We also added a sentence to the end of the second paragraph of the
discussion in reference to the two existing publications on Cannabis endophytic fungi. 
"Several 
 species are known to be endophytes on various plant species, including 
Penicillium
P.
 
 , and this raises the question of whether they are also 
 endophytes. Indeed, 
citrinum
Cannabis
P.
 and a species identified as 
 (a member of the citrinun clade
) have previously
citrinum
P. copticola
been identified as 
 endophytes, along with several 
 species

2. Explain the methodology used to select three culture-based detection systems in this study. Are
they the most widely-used systems? Are they the systems recommended by cannabis regulatory
agencies? If the method was simply “convenience sampling,” say so.
 
The
Author response: A sentence was added to the culture based methods section.  
culture-based methods selected for testing here represent those currently in use by established
medicinal Cannabis safety testing laboratories.
3. Methods used in the qPCR ITS assay should be described in the Methods section, not the
Results section.

4. Figure 2, “DNA sequencing of ITS2 amplicons from culture negative samples that are qPCR
positive for total yeast and mold tests,” deserves some comment. Some of the taxa are not yeasts
or molds. They include angiosperms 
), a protozoan (
(Zea mays, Pachysandra procumbens
), and an “uncultured bacterium.” Comment please.
Sterkiella histriomuscorum
 
Author response: The MG-RAST database contains multiple taxa. The hits to non-fungal
species contained multiple mismatches and were deemed spurious.  We filtered the data
to remove all non-fungal hits and regenerated the figures, reporting all fungal species
detected with 10 reads or more.  This resulted in a higher number of species reported for
some samples and fewer for others.  Figure 2 was revised and the figure legend
expanded.
 
5. This study revealed a surprisingly depauperate 
 foliar microbiome, compared to a
Cannabis
recent study of 
species, using similar methods, that identified 92 genera of organisms

(Cao 
 2015). See Delmotte 
 (2009) for rich microbiomes in other plant species.

      Where are the bacteria? Much of the concern over microbiology and food safety focuses on
human enteric pathogens (
 spp.) and opportunistic bacteria (
e.g., Escherichia coli, Salmonella
e.g.,
). Previous culture-based studies have isolated
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Berkholderia cepacia
these organisms from 
 (
 Taylor 
 1982, Ungerleider 
1982). The only
Cannabis e.g.,

bacterium you identify (in Figure 2, erroneously identified as a yeast or mold) isPantoea
formerly known as 
 a gram-negative bacterium and an
agglomerans, 
Enterobacter agglomerans,
opportunistic human pathogen.
Author response: This study focuses only on the fungal microbiome.  The studies cited
are looking at field-grown samples. We revised the MG-RAST figures to include all fungal
species detected down to a level of 10 reads.  This reveals a significantly larger number of
species in two samples. Other species display only a handful of species. Medicinal
Cannabis is often grown indoors in artificial media. The first paragraph of the discussion
section was expanded and split into two paragraphs as follows:
This study demonstrates detection of numerous fungal species by molecular screening of ITS2 in
"
several dispensary-derived 
 samples. These included the toxigenic 
species: 
Cannabis
Penicillium 
, 
 species: 
P. paxilli, P. citrinum P. commune, P. chrysogenum, P. corylophilum, Aspergillus
A.
, 
and 
 In addition, a pathogenic species 
terreus, A. niger, A. flavus A. versicolor 
Eurotium repens.
 was detected. The fungal microbiomes of the different samples differed
Cryptococcus liquefaciens
significantly in the number and diversity of species present.  Two samples contained a large
diversity of species, similar to previous studies that used field-grown samples and culture-based
outgrowth methods
. Other samples contained only a few species at significant levels. This is
perhaps not surprising given the prevalence of indoor culture methods using artificial growth media
for medicinal 
. However, we do not have any knowledge of the specific growth conditions
Cannabis
that were used for the samples analyzed.
Three different culture-based assays failed to detect all of the positive samples and one, BioLumix 
, detected only one out of 7 positive samples. A review of the literature suggests that Penicillium
microbes can be cultured on CYA media, but some may require colder temperatures (21-24C) and
7 day growth times 
 . Of the 
 only

Penicillium,
P. citrinum
with 3M Petri-Film 
 . It is possible the different water activity of the culture assay compared to the
natural flower environment is contributing to the false negative test results."

Minor critiques:
1.     The detection and confirmation of 
 and 
 deserves mention
Penicillium citrinum
Penicillium paxilli
in the abstract of the paper! An exhaustive review of the 
 literature (McPartland 
Cannabis
et al.
 2000) found no references to these organisms.
Here we describe the first next generation sequencing survey of the fungal communities found in
dispensary based Cannabis flowers by ITS2 sequencing, and demonstrate the sensitive detection
of several toxigenic 
 and 
 species, including 
 and 
, that
Penicillium
Aspergillus
P. citrinum
P. paxilli
were not detected by one or more culture-based methods currently in use for safety testing.
2.     Species names should never be capitalized. For example, 
 should read

P. Citrinum

3.     The full name should be spelled out the first time it appears in the Methods section, Penicillium

4.     The Methods section should explain that the

PaxP
Penicillium paxilli.
Methods section should identify NEP as New England BioLabs.

5.     Recommend some future directions: a comparison of indoor crops and outdoor crops
(outdoor crops may show a seasonal community succession), and survey the microbiome of police
seizures from well-provenanced foreign sources, such as Mexico.
