Nanodiamonds have demonstrated potential as powerful sensors in biomedicine, however, their trans-
lation into routine use requires a comprehensive understanding of their effect on the biological system
being interrogated. Under normal fabrication processes, nanodiamonds are produced with a graphitic
carbon shell, but are often oxidized in order to modify their surface chemistry for targeting to specific cel-
lular compartments. Here, we assessed the biological impact of this purification process, considering cel-
lular proliferation, uptake, and oxidative stress for graphitic and oxidized nanodiamond surfaces. We show
for the first time that oxidized nanodiamonds possess improved biocompatibility compared to graphitic
nanodiamonds in breast cancer cell lines, with graphitic nanodiamonds inducing higher levels of oxidative
stress despite lower uptake.
Introduction
Nanodiamonds have been proposed as a reliable and capable
replacement for fluorescent dyes in biomedical applications.
Nanodiamonds can contain substitutional atoms and vacant
lattice sites that result in photostable fluorescent color centers.
For example, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers1 have been
used with cells in vitro for tracking,2 temperature sensing,3
and magnetic field measurement.4,5 NV color centers also are
able to measure electric fields,6,7 pressure,8 pH 9 and nuclear
magnetic resonance spectra.10,11 Owing to their superior spin
properties
over
detonation
nanodiamonds,
High-Pressure
High-Temperature
(HPHT)
nanodiamonds
are
commonly
exploited for these measurements.12,13
After HPHT and detonation nanodiamond fabrication, the
nanodiamond surface is typically a layer of sp2 graphitic
carbon.14–16 For metrology in cells, this graphitic layer is
often removed by oxidation, which has been to shown to:
reduce charge switching between the NV− and NV0 charge
states;17
improve
brightness;18
and
facilitate
surface
functionalization to target nanodiamonds to particular intra-
cellular sites such as organelles.19,20 Identifying and under-
standing any cellular perturbations caused by the biological
application of nanodiamonds with different surface chem-
istries is vital.
The ability to perform intracellular measurements using
nanodiamonds relies firstly on a robust knowledge of the pro-
cesses that govern their internalization and retention. Both
graphitic and oxidized nanodiamonds have been observed to
be internalized,21,22 with oxidized nanodiamonds explicitly
shown to be actively internalized by clathrin-mediated endocy-
tosis.23 Oxidized nanodiamonds also appear to enhance
uptake of various pharmaceuticals and their corresponding
efficacy.24 The rate at which graphitic and oxidized nanodia-
monds are expelled from cells has been reported to be slow,
with only about 15% oxidized nanodiamonds expelled after six
days in HeLa cells.21,25
Next, consideration must be made of their potential cyto-
toxicity. Both graphitic and oxidized nanodiamonds have been
demonstrated to have little or no short-term cytotoxicity in
human cells in complete culture media,26–32 although there
have been cytotoxic effects observed in bacteria with both
surface types.33 Many studies have focused on short-term viabi-
lity; for the longer term experiments enabled by the chemical-
and photo-stability of nanodiamonds, a greater impact may be

 observed on proliferation over time, where slow cell division
and death processes can be examined. Application of graphitic
nanodiamonds in serum-free media over 24, 48 and 72 h has
been shown to reduce cell number,34 although a similar
study at 24 h for graphitic and oxidized nanodiamonds did
not observe a significant effect.31 Furthermore, in full
medium over 48 h, oxidized diamonds have been shown to
have little influence on cell number.35 In addition to
changes in cellular proliferation, nanoparticles may cause
transient stress responses,36,37 which have yet to be fully
explored for nanodiamonds. For example, oxidative stress, an
imbalance of free radical species and antioxidants, is an
important parameter that is linked to many cell processes
such as apoptosis, DNA degradation, as well as cardio-
vascular and neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer.38,39 If
nanodiamonds are to be exploited as a potential replacement
for fluorescent dyes, they should not only be benign in terms
of their impact on proliferation, but they should also avoid
induction of cellular stress responses. There have been a
limited number of studies of nanodiamond induced oxi-
dative stress responses; while unmodified detonation nano-
diamonds showed a small antioxidant effect,40 oxidized deto-
nation diamonds were found to cause a low level of reactive
oxygen species generation in one cell line.32 Detonation
nanodiamond is often compositionally more impure than
HPHT nanodiamond, likely changing how the biological
impact.41 Acid-oxidized diamonds were observed to have no
effect on unstressed neural cells and actually reduced the
stress in stressed cells.42
Here, we sought to determine the biological impacts of
both graphitic and oxidized HPHT nanodiamonds by analyz-
ing cellular uptake as well as proliferative and stress responses
in two breast cancer cell lines. We focus on HPHT nanodia-
mond rather than detonation diamond due to the aforemen-
tioned advantageous sensing capability. We present the first
direct comparison of graphitic and oxidized HPHT nano-
diamonds
using
realistic
concentrations
for
single
cell
measurements (≤1 μg mL−1), rather than the higher concen-
trations typically used for drug delivery.
Materials and methods
Nanodiamond preparation
Nanodiamonds (Non-detonation, NaBond Technologies Co.,
China)
were
manufactured
by
a
High-Pressure
High-
Temperature (HPHT) bulk diamond process then milled to a
nominal 45 nm, with less than 50 ppm nitrogen impurities
and
containing
fluorescent
nitrogen-vacancy
centers.
Oxidation to remove the graphite by burning was performed in
a Vecstar VTF1SP tube furnace in air, calibrated with a K-type
thermometer to 445 ± 5 °C. Nanodiamonds were drop-cast
onto a quartz coverslip (CFQ-2520, UQG Optics, UK) or con-
tained in a crucible (SS22, Almath, UK). The sample was
heated in air at 450 °C for 5 hours to remove the graphitic
shell (ESI Fig. 1†).
Nanodiamond characterization
Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) was performed with 14 mg
of nanodiamond powder (TGA 4000, PerkinElmer, USA). To
evaluate optimal conditions for oxidation, the heating temp-
erature was increased at 3 °C min−1 or 1 °C min−1 up to 900 °C
in air and the weight was measured every second. A plateau
was observed at 650 °C. The temperature was held at 120 °C
for 30 minutes to remove water. Heating at 3 °C per minute
decreased the nanodiamond mass remaining from 75% to
25% between 546 ± 1 °C and 592 ± 1 °C. Upon slower heating
at 1° per minute, the nanodiamonds were reduced from 75%
to 25% mass between of 534 ± 1 °C to 545 ± 1 °C (ESI
Fig. 1a†). The largest mass loss rate occurs at a consistent
temperature, 537 ± 1 °C (3 °C min−1) and 535 ± 1 °C
(1 °C min−1), as an exothermic reaction occurs to sustain a
burning phase. These results place an upper bound on the
temperature required to conserve most of the sample mass in
a heating plateau profile at 535 ± 1 °C. Considering the
derivative of this curve (ESI Fig. 1b†), 425–450 °C appears to
be sufficiently far below the onset of burning to perform the
oxidation.
For preparation of oxidized nanodiamonds for the experi-
ments in the remainder of this study, the temperature was
increased to 450 °C in 5 min, and then held at that level while
the mass change was monitored at 1 s intervals (ESI Fig. 1c†).
The instrument temperature was calibrated by alumel, perkal-
loy and iron magnetic phase transitions at the temperatures
154.2 °C, 596 °C and 780 °C to be accurate to ±1 °C across this
range. The error in the mass fraction decrease is given by com-
bining the errors in the linear fit to the nominal error in mass
accuracy of 0.02%.
To assess the impact of the oxidation process on the nano-
diamond chemistry,
optical spectroscopy was performed.
Raman micro-spectroscopy was performed with a WITec Alpha
300 R Confocal Raman microscope (WITec GmbH, Germany).
Samples were prepared by drop-casting diamonds onto a
calcium fluoride substrate (CAFP25-1U, UQG Optics, UK) and
Raman spectra were recorded using 4 mW 488 nm excitation
(CMX1-04813, Newport Corporation, USA) and a 20 × NA = 0.4
objective (421350-9970-000, Nikon, Japan). Data were collected
across a 400 μm × 400 μm area in 1 μm steps with 0.5 s inte-
gration time per point and calibrated by measuring a silicon
standard.
Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was con-
ducted
with
a
Nicolet
iS10
transmission
instrument
(ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) with the sample of nano-
diamonds on NaCl windows (Z527130, Sigma-Aldrich, USA).
64 scans per sample were taken with 2 cm−1 resolution. For
each measurement, a background of air and an empty slide
was used. FTIR spectra were processed by subtracting a cubic
polynomial background in the ranges 700–3100 cm−1 and
3800–4000 cm−1, and smoothed using a Savitsky-Golay filter
(width 201, order 2).

diamond sizes, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Dynamic

System.
Firstly,
two
intersecting
scratches were made with a diamond cutter onto a quartz sub-
strate (CFQ-1250, UQG optics, UK) for localization. The sub-
strate was cleaned in acetone then isopropanol in a Sonorex
Digital
10P
Ultrasonic
bath
at
63
°C
(BandelinGmbH,
Germany) for 30 minutes each. The nanodiamonds were
suspended in ethanol at 1.6 mg mL−1 and sonicated for
90 minutes at 320 W of ultrasonic power before deposition
on
the
quartz
by a
respiratory
nebulizer
(U22,
Omron
Healthcare Co., Kyoto, Japan). A 15 μm × 15 μm, 4096 × 4096
scan was taken at 0.2 Hz per line with Nanoworld Arrow-FM-20
Force Modulation tips using non-contact air topographical
imaging.
AFM data were processed in Gwyddion (GNU General
Public License at http://gwyddion.net/). At least 861 nano-
diamonds were assessed. The data were linearly subtracted
during collection to correct for tilt. Each image was rotated by
2.2° for mutual alignment and an identical background area
on each was set to zero. The images were cropped to show the
same diamonds. Data were collected by applying a threshold
mask that selected all observed diamonds (3 nm for each),
then all diamonds in the shadow of the large particles were
removed
and
the
maximum
height
of
the
remaining
particles was exported. The error in the mean was calculated
by dividing the standard deviation by the root of the popu-
lation size and the distributions were compared by the
Mann–Whitney U test.
Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) data were collected with a
Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZSP instrument. Samples were vor-
texed for 2 minutes at 2025 Hz on a VWR Mixer (444-0203,
VWR International Ltd, USA), followed by sonication in an
Ultrawave U300H (Ultrawave Ltd, UK), a repetition of vortexing,
then filtration through a 0.45 μm Polyethersulfone syringe
filter (514-0075, VWR International Ltd, USA). The sample was
placed within a plastic cuvette for the experiment (67.754
Polystyrene, Sarstedt AG & Co., Germany) with 637 nm exci-
tation and collection via 173° backscattering.
Cell culture
MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 adherent breast cancer cells were
grown in phenol-free Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM, 11880-028, ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) with 10%
heat
inactivated
Fetal
Calf
Serum
(FCS,
1050064,
ThermoFisher Scientific, USA). The cells were split at 80% con-
fluence in ratios 1 : 20 for MDA-MB-231s and 1 : 10 for MCF-7s.
MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 origins were verified by short tandem
repeat genotyping (performed at the Cancer Research UK
Cambridge Institute, UK).
Calculation of number of nanodiamonds per cell
The number of nanodiamonds per cell was calculated using
the following parameters. C: concentration = (0.01, 0.1 and
1 μg mL−1); V: volume of medium in a well = 0.3 mL; L: mean
characteristic dimension of the individual nanodiamonds43 =
23 nm; ρ: density of diamond = 3.5 × 103 kg m−3; and N:
number of cells per well = 3 × 105.

Uptake experiments
Cells were seeded into six optical-quality eight-well plates
(IB-80826, ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) at 5 × 104 cells per
well,
and
incubated
overnight
to
allow
for
attachment.
Graphitic and oxidized nanodiamonds at 1 μg mL−1 in 300 μL
medium with serum were added to three wells each per plate,
and fresh medium without nanodiamonds was added to two
wells per plate as controls. The plates were left for 1, 2, 4, 8, 24
and 48 hours. At the completion of the uptake time, the wells
were washed 3× in medium. They were then fixed in parafor-
maldehyde (HT5011, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 15 minutes, fol-
lowed by three washes in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution
(14025092, ThermoFisher Scientific, USA). Cell nuclei and
membranes were stained by addition of 3 mL HBSS containing
2 drops of NucBlue Live Ready Probes Reagent (R37605,
Invitrogen, USA) and 5 μg mL−1 Wheat Germ Agglutinin –
AlexaFluor 488 membrane dye (W11261, Invitrogen, USA) sim-
ultaneously for 10 minutes. The wells were then washed in
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (2×) and suspended in PBS.
The fixed cell samples were scanned with an Olympus
Confocal Fluorescence Microscope FV1200, using a 60× oil
objective, a pixel size of 132 nm, a scan speed of 4 μm s−1 and
a confocal size of 71 μm with a resolution of better than
215 nm. Bright field illumination was used to locate cells, so
that at least 175 nuclei were captured per condition. The z
position was set by moving upwards until the substrate was
not observed. The samples were sequentially raster scanned
with 405 nm, 488 nm and 633 nm lasers to the collect the
nuclear, membrane and nanodiamond signal respectively.
Nanodiamond aggregates were detected by elastic light scatter-
ing around 633 nm using a collection filter 575–675 nm.
Proliferation
Cellular proliferation measurements were conducted with an
Incucyte Zoom System (Essen Bioscience, USA). Four replicates
of 0, 0.01, 0.1 and 1 μg mL−1 nanodiamonds were added to
MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells in phenol-free DMEM media sup-
plemented
with
Glutamax
(35050-038,
ThermoFisher
Scientific, USA) and 10% FCS. A positive control for prolifer-
ation change was induced using 1 mM H2O2 (386790-100,
VWR, UK). Images were analyzed with the Incucyte Zoom soft-
ware version 2016, and a size threshold of 350 μm2 was used
so that nanodiamonds were not counted as cells.
Oxidative stress
Cells were seeded into eight-well plates at a density of 5 × 104
cells per well. Cells were incubated overnight and then washed
in DMEM/F-12 medium (21041-025, ThermoFisher Scientific,
USA) with serum. Graphitic and oxidized diamonds were each
added into two wells at 1 μg mL−1 in 300 μL media with serum

 and incubated for four hours. As a positive control to induce
oxidative stress, 200 μM tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) was
added to two wells one hour before imaging. Just prior to
imaging, media was removed from all wells and was replaced by
media containing two drops of NucBlue dye according to the rec-
ommended protocol and 0.5 μM CellRox™ Orange Reagent
(C10443, Invitrogen, USA) for 30 minutes. Cells were then washed
in fresh media and imaged live at 37 °C and 5% CO2 using an
excitation laser at 405 nm with collection within 425–475 nm,
and an excitation laser at 559 nm with detection within
570–670 nm. A scan speed of 10 ms per pixel at a confocal aper-
ture of 105 μm were used to capture images (512 × 512 pixels).
Data and image analysis
Raman spectra were analyzed using k-means clustering (WITec
Project 4, Witec GmbH, Germany) to extract the diamond
signal. Fluorescence background was removed by fitting and
subtraction of a 5th order polynomial between 800–1300 cm−1
and 1710–2500 cm−1. Data were normalized to the integral of
the pure diamond peak between 1280–1390 cm−1. The relative
amount of graphite on the sample was calculated by inte-
gration between 1490–1660 cm−1 and this wavenumber range
was used for p-value significance, error calculation and percen-
tage reduction. The area was calculated by using trapezium
rule, and its error was estimated by the standard deviation of
the data around a cubic fit. P-Value significance was investi-
gated by a two-tailed Mann–Whitney U test as the data did not
pass a normality test.
Proliferation tests were analyzed with standard ANOVA.
Where data sets violated the assumptions of a standard
ANOVA under the homogeneity of variances condition, in the
case of CellRox data, Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA and Dunnett’s
post-hoc test were used instead. Microscopy images were pro-
cessed using custom software written in FIJI ImageJ.44 For the
uptake experiment, image filenames were initially blinded and
artifacts were removed, including the scattering signals from
fragmenting nuclei. After this, nuclear areas were measured
and counted using the ‘Thresholding’ and ‘Particle Analyzer’
(>50 μm) functions. The membrane stain was used to define
the edges of cells, and filled to designate areas enclosed by
membrane. These areas were then removed if found not contain
a nucleus (Binary Feature Extractor45). The nanodiamond scat-
tering channel was thresholded by considering nine representa-
tive images and setting the value as closely as possible for both
cell lines. All diamonds that were not totally contained within
cells were removed (Binary Feature Extractor, 100% overlap45)
and the remaining particles were analyzed. Two factor ANOVA
via Regression was applied to account for unbalanced control
with post-hoc t-tests under Dunn-Šidák were used.
Results
Nanodiamond preparation and characterization
Oxidized nanodiamonds (ESI Fig. 2a†) were prepared by
heating
in
air
using
conditions
optimized
via
thermo-
gravimetric analysis to achieve low mass loss of approximately
2% over one hour, converging to a linear rate of −1.20 ± 0.02%
per hour (Fig. 1a, ESI Fig. 2b†). Verification of the oxidation
process was made using optical spectroscopy. Raman spec-
troscopy (Fig. 1b) showed that the peak associated with graphi-
tic carbon (1575 cm−1) was reduced in relative area under
curve compared to that of diamond (1332 cm−1) from 51.8 ±
0.5 to 12.2 ± 1.1 (arbitrary units, p = 2.2 × 10−12). Fourier

(1786 cm−1) and C–O–C peaks (1089 cm−1) relative to CvC
between 1430 cm−1 and 1490 cm−1 (ESI Fig. 2c and d†). Also,
as expected, the spectrum exhibited a shift in the CvO groups
from aldehyde (1721 cm−1) to carboxyl (1784 cm−1) as the
groups were converted into the most oxidized form through
the heating process.15,33,46–50
We next analysed the change in the size of the nano-
diamonds with oxidation. The mean size determined using
AFM before oxidation was 8.1 ± 0.2 nm, and after oxidation it
was 7.5 ± 0.2 nm, a reduction of 0.6 ± 0.2 nm (ESI Fig. 3a†).
From TGA we expect to see a ∼6% mass decrease after five
hours, which would correspond to a ∼0.2 nm radius decrease
on a spherical 7.6 nm nanodiamond, which is consistent with
these AFM findings. We also examined the aggregation of the

 nanodiamonds through DLS and confocal optical microscopy.
Examination of the size distribution of nanodiamonds sus-
pended in water at 66 μg mL−1 found that oxidized nano-
diamonds tend to aggregate into significantly smaller clumps
than graphitic nanodiamonds (ESI Fig. 3b†). The aggregation
of nanodiamonds is further exacerbated by suspension in the
complete media used for cell culture studies, where aggregates
of up to 6 μm in size could be observed; again, oxidized nano-
diamonds showed a smaller aggregate size compared to gra-
phitic nanodiamonds (ESI Fig. 3c and d†).
Nanodiamond uptake in cells
Cellular experiments were performed using two different
breast cancer cell lines. MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 are breast
cancer lines representative for mesenchymal-like and luminal-
like cancer types respectively. While MCF-7 cells express estro-
gen and progesterone receptors and form invasive breast
ductal carcinomas, MDA-MB-231 cells do not express estrogen
receptors and produce highly invasive and metastatic tumors.
Cells were exposed to nanodiamonds for up to 48 h and
microscopy images (Fig. 2, ESI Fig. 4†) show a clear increase in
the accumulation of nanodiamonds over time, many of which
were present as aggregate clumps of similar sizes. A detailed
summary of the size distribution of oxidized and graphitic
nanodiamond clumps in both cell types can be found in ESI
Fig. 5 and 6.† Interestingly, when examining the distributions
of particle sizes in cells (ESI Fig. 5 and 6†), the number of par-
ticles below 0.02 μm2 apparently decreases in MDA-MB-231s
over time, whereas the number of particles above 1 μm2
increases up to four hours, and then decreases between
8–24 hours. In contrast, MCF-7 cells continuously uptake par-
ticles throughout the 48 hours experiment.
Quantitatively,
our
data
show
that
MDA-MB-231
cells
showed a significantly higher uptake of oxidized rather than
graphitic nanodiamonds (Fig. 3a), with both a greater number
of particles (p = 4 × 10−8), as well as a greater observed area of
nanodiamond signal (p = 4 × 10−9). MDA-MB-231 cell uptake
reached a peak after four hours of exposure of 4.7 ± 0.9 μm2
Fig. 2
Nanodiamond uptake observed in MCF-7 cells. Cells were incubated with 1 μg mL−1 graphitic or oxidized nanodiamonds for 1, 2, 4, 8, 24 and
48 hours before fixation. Cells were then co-stained with NucBlue nuclear stain and membrane stain Wheat Germ Agglutinin-Alexa Fluor 488.
Nanodiamond scattering signal was detected at 633 nm. An increase in the number of nanodiamonds within cells may be observed over time up to
48 h (white arrows denote dense cellular uptake).

Nanodiamonds were internalized into cells over time in two different breast cancer cell lines: (a) MDA-MB-231 and (b) MCF-7 cells. ‘Total
area per cell’ refers to the total nanodiamond intracellular area in the images divided by the number of nuclei observed in that image. Oxidized dia-
monds were taken up in a greater amount than graphitic diamonds (p = 4 × 10−8 for MDA-MB-231s and p = 3 × 10−5 for MCF-7s). NBiologicalreplicates =
2 (control) and 3 (nanodiamond sample). NNuclei = 500 ± 200 per condition for MDA-MB-231 and 430 ± 170 per condition for MCF-7.

Nanodiamonds have negligible anti-proliferative effect. Graphitic diamonds cause a small decrease in confluency at 1 μg mL−1 in
MDA-MB-231 cells (top left, −5 ± 2%, p = 0.0014), but no other experiments showed any significant decrease at these concentrations. Nreplicates = 4.

dized diamonds respectively. The subsequent decline in signal
is likely due to cell division over the following hours. By con-
trast, MCF-7 cells showed a more similar uptake of graphitic
and oxidized nanodiamonds until 24 h, at which point the
uptake of graphitic nanodiamonds appeared to reach satur-
ation (Fig. 3b). MCF-7 cells also showed a level of uptake that

also significantly higher than graphitic diamond uptake in
MCF-7 cells (p = 3 × 10−5), making this a consistent finding
across both cell types.
Cellular proliferation with nanodiamonds
Next, experiments were performed to assess whether the
uptake of graphitic and oxidized nanodiamonds had any
impact on the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7
breast cancer cell lines. We added nanodiamond concen-
trations of 0, 0.01, 0.1 and 1 μg mL−1, corresponding to
approximately 200, 2000 and 20 000 nanodiamonds per cell.
Hydrogen peroxide was used as a positive control of cell
death and phosphate buffered saline as a negative control.
We used automated phase contrast microscopy (Incucyte) to
count
cells and determine confluency. Considering the
growth phase between 48 and 108 hours, cell confluency was
slightly reduced at 1 μg mL−1 for graphitic nanodiamonds on
the MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 4a) cells (−5 ± 2%, p = 0.0014), but no
change was observed with oxidized diamonds (+1 ± 4% p =
0.89). MCF-7 (Fig. 4b) cells appeared to be unaffected by the
addition of nanodiamonds of either type (graphitic: +2 ± 2%
p = 0.37, oxidized: −1 ± 3% p = 0.73).
Nanodiamond-induced stress
Finally, we examined the cellular oxidative stress responses to
evaluate whether any transient effects were present that did
not manifest as anti-proliferative. MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 5a)
showed significant increase in oxidative stress under appli-
cation of the positive control TBHP and for incubation with
graphitic nanodiamonds (ANOVA p = 6 × 10−5). In post-hoc
comparison, the critical threshold of the d-statistic was 2.3,
which was surpassed by the TBHP (d-stat = 8.7) and the gra-
phitic diamonds (d-stat = 4.6). Oxidized nanodiamonds did
not show any effect on oxidative stress, with levels remaining
comparable to the control condition (d-stat = 1.8). This
pattern of response was repeated in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5b),
where TBHP and graphitic diamonds were found to induce
stress at a level above the control (d-stat = 3.6, d-stat = 5.7
respectively) and oxidized diamonds did not show a signifi-
cant change (d-stat = 1.7). Oxidative stress measurements
were made at both 1 h and 2 h time points; teasing these
apart it was apparent that MDA-MB-231 cells were most
stressed in the initial 1 h but had largely returned to normal
stress levels after 2 h. MCF-7 cells had a more similar
response at both time points. The higher stress levels from
graphitic nanodiamonds are of particular note, given the
lower uptake of these nanodiamonds into cells.
Discussion
Nanodiamonds containing NV centers have been explored as a
chemical- and photo-stable replacement for fluorescent dyes
in cells for applications such as organelle tracking and temp-
erature sensing. Here, we sought to determine the biological
impacts of both graphitic and oxidized HPHT nanodiamonds,
examining cellular uptake as well as potential impacts on pro-
liferation and importantly, cellular stress responses. We chose
to focus on HPHT nanodiamonds as their superior spin
properties
have
led
to
wide
use
for
biological
sensing
applications,5,17,51–53 both in graphitic2 and oxidized forms.52
Oxidized forms of nanodiamond have often been used in bio-
logical experiments due to their improved functionalization
Fig. 5
Graphitic nanodiamonds produced increased levels of cellular
oxidative stress for (a) MDA-MB-231 cells. Graphitic diamonds had a sig-
nificant d-statistic (= 4.6 > d-critical = 2.3) and TBHP performed suc-
cessfully as the positive control (significant d-statistic = 8.7 > d-critical =
2.3) (b) MCF-7 cells (significant d-statistic = 5.7 > d-critical = 2.3). TBHP,
the positive control performed as expected 3.6 > d-critical = 2.3.
Oxidized diamonds did not increase the cellular stress in either cell line.
Oxidative stress was generally higher at 1 h time point for graphitic dia-
monds. Outliers greater than 1.5× the interquartile range were not
plotted. d-Statistics were used in place of p values, as the sample did
not reflect a normal distribution, and so the analysis was done on ranked
data. Nimages = 24, 31, 33, 15, 25, 24, 33, 31 (column order), Ncells = 451,
478, 671, 368, 530, 433, 897, 773.

 capability, but direct comparison of biocompatibility via oxi-
dative stress in graphitic and oxidized HPHT nanodiamonds
from the same batch has yet to be reported.
We have shown for the first time that oxidized HPHT nano-
diamonds show improved biocompatibility compared to gra-
phitic HPHT nanodiamonds. In breast cancer cell lines, gra-
phitic nanodiamonds induced higher levels of oxidative stress
despite lower uptake compared to oxidized nanodiamonds. We
observed an order of magnitude greater nanodiamond uptake
in MCF-7 cells over time, particularly at the later time points,
when compared against MDA-MB-231 cells. This is consistent
with the increased expression of clathrin protein in MCF-7
cells,54 as nanodiamonds have previously been observed to be
mostly internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis.23 We
also observed oxidized nanodiamond being uptaken at a
higher rate than graphitic nanodiamonds in both cell lines,
but with a more dramatic difference in the MDA-MB-231 cells.
We noted that oxidized nanodiamonds formed smaller aggre-
gates in cell culture media, which may go some way to explain
these differences. In particular, at least 72% of oxidized nano-
diamond aggregates were below 250 nm in diameter, while at
least 56% of graphitic nanodiamond aggregates were below
this size. If further size reduction were needed in future appli-
cations, it would be possible to use techniques such as bead-
assisted sonic disintegration or salt-assisted dry attrition
milling for temporary physical separation of the particles,55 or
the addition of chemicals to the nanodiamond surface such
as
serum
proteins,56,57
surfactants,58
lysine59
or
various
polymers60–64 for chemical separation.
Uptake dynamics have been shown to be shape dependent
in nanodiamonds, with rounder particles remaining in cells
for longer,21 so it may be that oxidized nanodiamonds form
aggregates of different roundness; this would need to be veri-
fied in future by a higher resolution technique such as TEM.
Furthermore, nanoparticle surface charge can be an important
factor in intracellular uptake, although contradictory findings
have been reported in the literature with regard to how nano-
particle interactions with the cell surface relates to surface
charges.65,66 Oxidized nanodiamonds have been reported to
exhibit more electronegative zeta potentials,57,67–69 so the
difference in surface charge between the two nanodiamond
types studied here may contribute to the differences in uptake.
In proliferative studies on cells, we observed a small but sig-
nificant decrease in proliferation under the highest concen-
tration of HPHT graphitic diamonds in MDA-MB-231 cells. No
significant difference was observed at any of the tested concen-
trations of oxidized nanodiamonds. This low cytotoxicity
profile
is
consistent
with
other
published
work,
which
generally
shows
low
or
non-existent
nanodiamond
cytotoxicity,30–32,70–74 over similar time courses.29,75–77 Our
work on HPHT diamond aligns with studies on detonation
diamond despite the compositional differences,41 with graphi-
tic nanodiamonds suppressing cell proliferation and oxidized
nanodiamonds
having
the
lowest
cytotoxic
effect.15,28
Although we did not observe any anti-proliferative effect of oxi-
dized nanodiamonds, we exposed our cells to a concentration
range suitable for experiments interrogating local organelle
tracking or temperature sensing, rather than those used
for drug delivery, which would be substantially higher.
At
higher
concentrations
such
as

effects
including apoptosis have been observed even with oxidized
nanodiamonds.78
Evaluating oxidative stress in cells exposed to nanodiamonds,
we observed that graphitic HPHT diamonds cause a high degree
of stress in cells, exceeding that of the positive control. This
agrees with previous studies where unmodified nanodiamonds
were observed to produce oxidative stress,79,80 though neither
the amount of graphite nor the fabrication procedure were
defined in these studies. The observation of oxidative stress
under graphitic nanodiamonds is also reported for other
forms
of
sp2
carbon,81–83
especially
pure
carbon
black
particles.84–86 Horie et al. also examined three varieties of
nanodiamonds with different zeta potentials.75 Those with
positive zeta potentials caused oxidative stress, while the nega-
tive ones did not, which may be consistent with our findings.
Of particular interest in our results is the fact that we did not
observe any oxidative stress when cells were exposed to oxi-
dized diamonds, consistent with previous reports at both the
cellular42 and organism levels.87
Our results therefore suggest that the impact of the surface
chemistry of nanodiamonds can be significant for biological
applications. It would therefore be prudent for nanodiamonds
to be oxidized prior to application in cells, regardless of
whether
they
are
being
subjected
to
functionalization.
According to our findings, oxidation can increase cellular
uptake and minimize any potential oxidative stress response.
These benefits exist in addition to the well known benefits of
reduced charge switching between the NV− and NV0 charge
states,17
improved
brightness18
and
facilitating
surface
functionalization for targeting.19,20
Despite the promising findings of our direct comparison of
the biological impacts of graphitic and oxidized nanodia-
monds in two different cell types, there remain some limit-
ations to our study. Firstly, biocompatibility is expected to be
determined by surface chemistry and shape,88 so it is reason-
able to expect that differences in the fabrication methods such
as HPHT or detonation processes could cause variations in the
cellular response. A direct comparison of nanodiamonds of a
similar size and shape produced by the two different processes
would be of interest in future work. Secondly, to prepare our
oxidized nanodiamonds we use oxidation by heating in air
alone. While this is a commonly used procedure,19 it is also
often replaced or combined with cleaning by acids, UV-Ozone,
or oxygen plasma, which may exaggerate the differences in
surface chemistry, potentially leading to different results in
uptake, proliferation and oxidative stress. Thirdly, the optical
scattering measurement used in our uptake experiments has
been shown to be insensitive below a diameter of 37 nm for
nanodiamonds,89 so we may be missing signals associated
with any free nanodiamonds undergoing passive uptake, as
suggested elsewhere.23 However, given the size distributions of
our nanodiamonds in solution, we expect this to be a relatively

 minor contribution to the overall signal. Finally, we studied
only uptake, proliferation and oxidative stress. Future work
should examine other potential sources of stress response,
such as inflammatory or genotoxic responses.79
Conclusions
It is vitally important for any sensor used to perform measure-
ments in a biological system to avoid perturbation of the
system that it is measuring. We have shown that nanodiamond
oxidation, which is used to reduce charge switching between
NV− and NV0 and to improve brightness, is also advantageous
for increasing intracellular uptake and avoiding oxidative
stress in cells. Improved biocompatibility is crucial for the use
of nanodiamonds as a revolutionary biomedical tool and
implies that HPHT graphitic diamonds should first be oxi-
dized for biological metrology, as this greatly reduces the effect
that the sensor has on the system it is measuring.
