The Mars mission will result in an inevitable exposure to cosmic radiation that has been shown to cause 
cognitive impairments in rodent models, and possibly in astronauts engaged in deep space travel. 
Of particular concern is the potential for cosmic radiation exposure to compromise critical decision 
making during normal operations or under emergency conditions in deep space. Rodents exposed to 
cosmic radiation exhibit persistent hippocampal and cortical based performance decrements using six 
independent behavioral tasks administered between separate cohorts 12 and 24 weeks after irradiation. 
Radiation-induced impairments in spatial, episodic and recognition memory were temporally coincident 
with deficits in executive function and reduced rates of fear extinction and elevated anxiety. Irradiation 
caused significant reductions in dendritic complexity, spine density and altered spine morphology 
along medial prefrontal cortical neurons known to mediate neurotransmission interrogated by our 
behavioral tasks. Cosmic radiation also disrupted synaptic integrity and increased neuroinflammation 
that persisted more than 6 months after exposure. Behavioral deficits for individual animals correlated 
significantly with reduced spine density and increased synaptic puncta, providing quantitative 
measures of risk for developing cognitive impairment. Our data provide additional evidence that deep 
space travel poses a real and unique threat to the integrity of neural circuits in the brain.
The exploration of space presents countless challenges to the ingenuity of humankind. Vast distances separate 
our planet from those within and beyond our solar system and necessitate further advances in engineering to 
minimize the deep space travel time and in biology to ameliorate as many of the adverse effects of prolonged 
space travel as possible. While many threats to the success of such extraterrestrial missions have been popularized 
in the media and entertainment industries, one area that has not received such attention are the human health 
risks associated with cosmic radiation exposure. As NASA plans a mission to Mars, astronauts will inevitably be 
exposed to low fluences of highly energetic and fully ionized nuclei that define the spectrum of galactic cosmic 
rays (GCR)1–3. Charged particles that represent the GCR are a component of cosmic radiation that is deflected 
from the surface of the Earth by its protective magnetosphere. Due to their high energy, multiple charged par-
ticle species can penetrate the hull of a spacecraft and tissues of the body depositing a trail of dense ionizations 
along particle trajectories3. In the body, the ionization events resulting from these interactions damage a variety 
of critical molecular targets, producing complex lesions that compromise cellular repair processes and protract 
the recovery of irradiated tissues. Recovery from cosmic radiation injury is further confounded by secondary 
ionizations caused by delta rays that emanate from primary particle tracks, considerably increasing the range and 
amount of cellular damage4,5.
NASA and international space agencies have recognized the potential health concerns associated with cosmic 
radiation exposure6, and based on recent evidence derived from rodent models have an increased awareness of 
the potential neurocognitive complications that could compromise mission critical activities or long term cogni-
tive health7. Despite our long-standing knowledge that patients subjected to cranial radiotherapy for the control 
of brain malignancies develop severe and progressive cognitive deficits8,9, the total doses and radiation types used 
in the clinic differ significantly from those encountered in space. Compelling evidence has now demonstrated 
the adverse effects of space-relevant fluences of charged particles on cognition7,10–15, and our studies, have linked 
functional behavioral decrements to the erosion of neuronal structure and synaptic integrity in specific regions 
of the brain7,16. Importantly, these changes were found to persist 6 weeks following acute exposure of rodents to 
charged particles, and showed little or no signs of recovery, regeneration or repair7. Here, we extend our studies

mance at not only 12, but 24 weeks after acute exposure, effects that are associated with reductions in dendritic 
complexity, changes in synaptic protein levels and elevations in neuroinflammation.
Results
Cosmic radiation causes long-term cognitive dysfunction. 
To assess the functional consequences 
of cosmic radiation exposure on the brain, we behaviorally tested mice 12 weeks after exposure to 48Ti or 16O 
(Fig. 1). While impairments on the novel object recognition (NOR) task can be caused by multiple underlying 
causes, it can indicate changes in the functional connectivity of the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex 
(mPFC) and requires the animal to distinguish a novel object from a familiar object. Analysis of this preference 
for novelty in NOR testing showed a significant group effect as indicated by a reduced DI [F (4, 51) = 
 2.897, 
P = 
 0.03]. Multiple comparison testing showed that exposure to 30 cGy 48Ti significantly reduced recognition 
memory (P = 
 0.03), while 5 cGy 48Ti or 16O and 30 cGy 16O had no effect on memory retention (Fig. 1a). Following 
the NOR task, mice were habituated and tested on the object in place (OiP) task which is also dependent on 
Figure 1. Cognitive deficits evaluated 12 weeks after cosmic radiation exposure. (a) Analysis of preference 
for novelty on a Novel Object Recognition (NOR) task shows that 30 cGy 48Ti particle irradiation significantly 
reduced recognition memory. (b) Performance on an Object in Place (OiP) task shows decrements in spatial 
memory retention for mice exposed to 30 cGy 48Ti particles as manifested in a reduced preference to explore 
an object found in a novel location. (c) All 48Ti and 16O irradiations significantly impaired recency memory 
as evident by a reduced preference for the less recently explored object in the Temporal Order task (TO).

intact hippocampal and prefrontal and perirhinal cortical functions. In this case, functionally intact mice exhibit 
a preference towards objects that have been moved to a novel location. The results of this test show statistically 
 
significant group difference, again indicated by a markedly reduced preference to explore novelty 
 
[F (4, 42) = 
 3.427, P = 
 0.02] (Fig. 1b). Individual analysis showed that 48Ti 30 cGy irradiation impaired OiP memory 
 
(P < 
 0.004), while 5 cGy 48Ti or 16O and 30 cGy 16O again had no effect on spatial memory function. Lastly, the 
mice were tested on the temporal order (TO) task where animals were familiarized with two sets of objects, 
4 hours apart. Mice with intact hippocampal function show a preference for the first object explored rather than 
the more recent object. The results of this test demonstrate that cosmic radiation exposure impaired recency 
memory as reflected by a reduced preference for less recently presented object (Fig. 1c). Analysis of recency dis-
crimination in the TO task revealed an overall group effect [F (4, 43) = 7.753; P < 0.0001]. Further multiple com-
parison analyses showed that all HZE particle exposures impaired recency memory, 5 and 30 cGy 16O (P < 
 0.0001 
and P = 
 0.01, respectively) and 5 and 30 cGy 48Ti (P = 
 0.005 and P = 
 0.05, respectively). Total exploration times 
of mice for each of these tasks is provided in Supplementary Table 1 (S1A–C). The inability of these irradiated 
animals to react to novelty after exposure to space relevant doses of cosmic radiation demonstrates the persistence 
of cognitive decrements in learning and memory. These data extend our past findings obtained at 6 weeks post 
exposure16, and demonstrate that charged particle irradiation results in robust and persistent deficits in recogni-
tion and temporal order memory 12 weeks later.
To determine further the extent and nature of cosmic radiation-induced behavioral deficits, a different 
rodent model (male Wistar rats) was used to assess executive function through their capability to perform 
attentional set shifting17. For these studies, exposure to GCR relevant low doses (5 cGy) of 48Ti caused signif-
icant decrements (P = 
 0.048, Mann-Whitney) in compound discrimination (CD) when assessed at the same 
12 week post-irradiation time point (Fig. 1d). Deficits in CD, indicated by the increased number of attempts 
required to successfully reach criterion (6 consecutive accurate choices) indicate the relative inability of those 
animals to identify and focus on task relevant cues. Other tasks involving simple discrimination (SD) and com-
pound discrimination reversal (CDR) were not impaired at this post-irradiation time. These results extend our 
cognitive findings considerably and now demonstrate that charged particle exposure compromises executive 
function and temporal order memory that can be linked to impaired perirhinal cortex function over extended 
post-irradiation times.
Given the wide-ranging cognitive deficits found 12 weeks after cosmic radiation exposure, we assessed the per-
sistence of these decrements 24 weeks after irradiation (Fig. 2). Analysis at 24 weeks revealed overall significant 
group differences for the preference of novelty for the NOR task [F (4, 39) = 3.601, P = 0.02]. 48Ti particle irradi-
ation was again most damaging, significantly reducing the DI of the 5 and 30 cGy irradiated mice, as compared 
to controls (P = 
 0.03), while neither dose of 16O had an effect on recognition memory (Fig. 2a). Performance on 
the OiP task showed significant decrements in spatial memory retention, again indicated by a markedly reduced 
preference to explore novelty [F (4, 38) = 
 5.018, P = 
 0.002]. Multiple comparison analysis showed that the pref-
erence for novelty in OiP was significantly reduced following 30 cGy 16O (P = 
 0.02) 5 and 30 cGy 48Ti (P = 
 0.001 
and P = 
 0.02, respectively) irradiation when compared to controls (Fig. 2b). At 24 weeks, HZE particle exposure 
was again shown to impair TO memory as demonstrated by reduced recency discriminations [F (4, 44) = 
 5.012, 
P = 
 0.002] following irradiation. Multiple comparison testing showed that exposure to cosmic radiation signifi-
cantly reduced preference for the less recently presented, sample phase 1 object, 5 and 30 cGy 16O (P = 
 0.04 and 
P = 
 0.007, respectively) and 5 and 30 cGy 48Ti (P = 
 0.003 and P = 
 0.05, respectively; Fig. 2c). Total exploration 
times of mice for each of these tasks is again provided in Supplementary Table 2 (S2A–C). These data suggest that 
the effects of irradiation on cognition persist over extended times with no apparent reduction in severity. These 
longer-term changes in performance were again found to manifest dose independence, suggesting an absence of, 
or a lower dose threshold (≤ 
5 cGy) for charged particle-induced cognitive impairment. These data demonstrate 
that space-relevant fluences of charged particles can elicit surprisingly long-term cognitive decrements in learn-
ing and memory that persist for at least 6 months.
To ascertain whether cosmic radiation exposure was associated with additional behavioral consequences, a 
separate cohort of animals was tested for fear extinction and anxiety 24 weeks following exposure to 48Ti par-
ticles (30 cGy, Fig. 2d,e). Fear extinction refers to an active process that involves the dissociation of a learned 
response to a prior adverse event. Irradiation had no effect on associative learning as indicated by robust 
freezing following exposure [Fig. 2d; Two-way RM ANOVA, F (1, 16) = 
 0.9210, P = 
 0.4]. Unirradiated mice 
exhibited a gradual decrease in freezing behavior over the extinction training [Fig. 2d, Two-way RM ANOVA, 
F (1, 18) = 
 14.61, P = 
 0.001]. Furthermore, time spent in freezing was statistically indistinguishable between 
control and irradiated groups on day 3 (sessions 11–15) [Multiple t test, DF = 
 12, P = 
 0.001]. Control mice 
showed abolished fear memory as demonstrated by reduced freezing behavior in the memory retrieval test 
when compared to irradiated animals [Fig. 2d, Unpaired t test, DF = 
 12, P = 
 0.02]. Unirradiated mice exhibited 
significant extinction or re-learning as evidenced by reduced freezing between first to last (15th) extinction 
training session [Fig. 2e Paired t test, t = 
 5.035, DF = 
 6, P = 
 0.002], while irradiated mice continued to show 
robust freezing [paired t test, DF = 
 6, P = 
 0.1] during both 1st and 15th trials. Baseline freezing values for this 
task are provided in Supplementary Table 3 (S3).
The ability to dissociate certain events from adverse outcomes (inhibitory learning) over time helps maintain 
cognitive health by minimizing stress18. When irradiation compromises the process of extinction, increased anx-
iety may result. To quantify anxiety, animals exposed to 48Ti particles (30 cGy) were subjected to an elevated plus 
maze (EPM) that provides animals the choice of remaining in either “open” or more protected, “closed”
, arms 
of the maze. HZE particle irradiation enhances anxiety-like behavior as evident by reduced numbers of entries 
into the open arms [Fig. 2f, Unpaired t test, DF = 
 20, P = 
 0.01] and less time spent in the open arms [Unpaired 
 
t test, DF = 
 16, P = 
 0.001] for the irradiated mice as compared to the control group. Correlations between mem-
ory extinction and EPM data show the relationship between heightened anxiety and reduced rates of extinction

Figure 2. Cognition remains significantly impaired 24 weeks following exposure to cosmic radiation.  
(a) Analysis of the preference for novelty in the Novel Object Recognition (NOR) task demonstrates that charged 
particle irradiation continues to impair object recognition memory 6 months following exposure to low doses 
of 48Ti particles, while animals exposed to 16O remain unaffected. (b) Performance on the Object in Place (OiP) 
task, however, shows significant decrements in spatial memory retention following exposure to 30 cGy 16O, and 
5 and 30 cGy 48Ti particles when compared to controls. (c) Analysis of preference for the Temporal Order (TO) 
task shows all 48Ti and 16O irradiations significantly impaired recency memory as shown by a reduced preference 
for the less recently explored object. (d) Irradiation using 30 cGy of 48Ti particles did not impair the acquisition 
of conditioned fear as demonstrated by similar freezing times observed by tone-shock trial 5 for both control and 
exposed mice. All mice showed a gradual decrease in freezing behavior over the extinction training on day 3, 
however the time spent freezing was significantly greater for the irradiated mice as compared to controls. Control 
mice successful abolish fear memory as demonstrated by reduced freezing behavior in the memory retrieval test 
when compared to irradiated mice. (e) Irradiated mice showed robust freezing between the first and last extinction 
training session as compared to controls, demonstrating that irradiated mice have a compromised ability to 
relearn. (f) Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) testing reveals that charged particle irradiation enhances anxiety-like 
behavior as demonstrated by reduced numbers of entries and time spent to open arms when compared controls. 
(g) Irradiated mice exhibiting severe extinction impairment also had increased anxiety as compared to control 
mice that were able extinguished fear memories. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, one-way ANOVA followed by

(Fig. 2g). The ratio of the number of entries and time spent in closed arms versus open arms are provided in 
Supplementary Table 4 (S4). These data demonstrate that increased anxiety may also contribute to the inability 
to properly engage “unlearning” processes, representing yet another cognitive risk factor associated with cosmic 
radiation exposure.
Cosmic radiation exposure reduces the dendritic complexity of mPFC neurons. 
Cognitive 
changes may be predictive of structural alterations, and based on the behavioral paradigms used we postulated 
that neurons within the mPFC would exhibit indications of radiation-induced damage. Therefore, following cog-
nitive testing, the morphometric assessment of neurons in the prelimbic layer of the mPFC was conducted. This 
analysis was facilitated by the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expressed in neurons of the Thy1-EGFP 
transgenic strain of mice, allowing for high resolution imaging of select neurons throughout the brain (14, 15). 
Digital reconstructions of confocal Z-stacks exhibited marked reduction in the dendritic arborization (Fig. 3, 
green) of mPFC neurons throughout the prelimbic cortical layers (I–VI) 15 weeks after exposure to charged par-
ticles. Quantitative analysis of dendritic branching patterns and length showed significant reductions in the num-
ber of dendritic branches, branch points, and overall dendritic length for every dosing paradigm used (Fig. 3). 
As was found for the cognitive endpoints, none of these long-term structural changes were dose-responsive, sug-
gesting either lower dose thresholds or the absence thereof. Again, these data validate our past findings observed 
at 6 weeks post exposure7, and further demonstrate the marked and persistent deterioration of neuronal structure 
following cosmic radiation exposure.
Cosmic radiation exposure reduces spine density along mPFC neurons. 
To determine the effects 
of cosmic radiation exposure on dendritic spines, higher-resolution analysis of reconstructed dendritic seg-
ments was performed. Comparison of control animals to animals exposed to charged particle radiation showed 
a marked reduction in dendritic spines 15 weeks later (Fig. 4a, red). When normalized to dendritic length, (i.e. 
10 μ 
m), each charged particle type and dose was found to elicit reduced yields of total dendritic spines and spine 
density that were dose-independent (Fig. 4a). Consistent with our past results7, our present findings highlight yet 
another structural parameter of neurons that remain compromised at protracted post irradiation times.
Functional and structural correlations after cosmic radiation exposure. 
To validate the functional 
relevance of morphometric analyses, the individual behavioral performance of each mouse (i.e. DI value) was 
plotted against its respective spine density (1.2 mm2) for all irradiation paradigms. Correlating dendritic spine 
density against the corresponding performance of each animal subjected to the OiP task revealed consistent and 
significant trends (Fig. 4b). For 16O exposures, Spearman correlations are as follows: r = 
 0.29 for 0 Gy controls 
(P = 
 0.48), r = 
 1.0 for 5 cGy (*P = 
 0.01) and r = 
 0.90 for 30 cGy (P = 
 0.08). For 48Ti exposures, Spearman corre-
lations are as follows: r = 
 0.29 for 0 Gy controls (P = 
 0.48), r = 
 1.0 for 5 cGy (**P = 
 0.01) and r = 
 1.0 for 30 cGy 
(**P = 
 0.01). With the exception of animals subjected to 30 cGy 16O particles, reduced spine density was corre-
lated significantly with lower DI values for all irradiated cohorts when compared to controls. These data clearly 
demonstrate the importance of correlating persistent radiation-induced changes in neuronal morphometry to 
behavioral performance, where certain structural changes in neurons correspond to select deficits in cognition.
Cosmic radiation exposure reduces specific spine types. 
To analyze further potential differences in the 
susceptibility of morphologically distinct spines to cosmic radiation exposure, distinct subclasses of spines were 
categorized and quantified 15 weeks following irradiation (Fig. 5). Reconstructed dendritic segments were scru-
tinized for changes in specific subclasses of spines after irradiation, as shown in representative images. Dendritic 
spines were classified as filopodia, long, mushroom, or stubby based on rigorous morphometric criteria as 
described previously19. The data clearly illustrate that cosmic radiation exposure caused dose-independent reduc-
tions in multiple immature spine types along mPFC neurons. Significantly lower numbers of filopodia (30–37%), 
 
thin (32–35%) and mushroom (21–34%) spines types were found after 16O or 48Ti particle exposures, while 
mature stubby spines were more radioresistant. These data clearly show that spines of defined morphology exhibit 
differential susceptibility to cosmic irradiation.
Increased PSD-95 synaptic puncta after irradiation of mPFC neurons. 
To complement structural 
analyses, the levels of postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) puncta were quantified from deconvoluted con-
focal images of immunohistochemically stained tissue sections (Fig. 6). High-resolution imaging of brain tissue 
(layer II of the mPFC) revealed consistent and significant increases in the yield of PSD-95 puncta after all charged 
particle irradiations (Fig. 6a). Exposure to either dose of 16O or 48Ti particles increased PSD-95 levels by ~1.2–1.4 
fold along neurons in the mPFC in a dose-independent manner (Fig. 6b). These data indicate that, in addition 
to structural changes, charged particle exposure elicits persistent and significant alterations in the amount and 
distribution of specific synaptic proteins that remain 15 weeks following acute exposures. Data are also consistent 
with past data sets obtained at 6 weeks7, and indicate that similar irradiation paradigms elicit long lasting changes 
in critical synaptic proteins.
Correlating synaptic and functional changes after cosmic radiation exposure. 
To determine how 
the observed changes in synaptic PSD-95 puncta corresponded with changes in cognition, similar correlation 
analyses were performed as those described for spine density (Fig. 6c). For these comparisons, elevated PSD-95 
levels significantly correlated with reduced DI for all conditions except those for the animals exposed to 5 cGy 
16O particles. For 16O exposures, Spearman correlations are as follows: r = 
 − 
0.27 for 0 Gy controls (P = 
 0.48), 
r = 
 − 
0.90 for 5 cGy (P = 
 0.08) and r = 
 − 
1.0 for 30 cGy (**P = 
 0.01). For 48Ti exposures, Spearman correlations 
are as follows: r = 
 − 
0.15 for 0 Gy controls (P = 
 0.69), r = 
 − 
1.0 for 5 cGy (**P = 
 0.01) and r = 
 − 
1.0 for 30 cGy

(**P = 0.01). Thus, with the exception of animals subjected to 5 cGy 16O particles, individual performance on the 
OiP task was significantly lower and inversely correlated with elevated PSD-95 puncta, an effect that was most 
pronounced for animals irradiated with 30 cGy of 48Ti particles. These data again indicate additional consistent

and persistent charged particle-induced effects in the brain. While the functional significance of elevated PSD-95 
puncta is less certain, changes in synaptic protein levels have proven to be reliable markers of cosmic and terres-
trial radiation exposure of the brain.
Cosmic radiation-induced neuroinflammation. 
While morphometric alterations to neurons are likely 
to play a pivotal role in neurocognitive outcomes, other factors may directly or indirectly impair neurotransmis-
sion following cosmic radiation exposure. To ascertain whether charged particle irradiation caused persistent 
alterations in the levels of activated microglia, ED1 immunopositive cells were quantified 15 and 27 weeks later. 
For all irradiation conditions and time points, the number of ED1 positive cells increased significantly (Fig. 7). At 
15 weeks post-irradiation ED1 levels were increased by ~1.2–1.6 fold and further elevated to ~2-fold at 27 weeks.

The persistence of microglial activation is noteworthy and suggests that low dose charged particle exposure elicits 
an increase in the number of inflammatory cells that prune neuronal processes, thereby disrupting neurotrans-
mission and cognition.
Discussion
Recent studies from our laboratory have confirmed the adverse effects of cosmic radiation exposure on CNS func-
tion7,15,16. Cognitive tasks used in the present study corroborate past findings and identify significant longer-term 
deficits in episodic, spatial, recognition memory and compound discrimination mapping to regionally defined 
and more global regions that include the frontal and temporal lobes containing the hippocampus, mPFC and 
perirhinal cortex7,13–15,17,20. Persistent behavioral decrements on the NOR, OiP, TO and attentional set shift testing 
paradigms lasting 4–6 months following low dose exposure to charged particles, considerably extends our past 
work7 and highlights the exquisite sensitivity of the brain to biophysical interactions with cosmic rays. These new 
data reveal additional detrimental effects related to fear extinction and anxiety, where charged particle irradia-
tion compromises the ability to dissociate adverse events and outcomes. The inability to moderate reactions to 
certain unpleasant stimuli could elicit elevated stress, anxiety and otherwise disadvantageous responses in unex-
pected or emergency situations, responses that have been linked to changes in the mPFC21. Such conditions could 
clearly be problematic for astronauts and their capability to efficiently operate over the course of a deep space 
 
mission, and impairments in executive function point to further potential complications in conducting complicated 
 
multifaceted tasks or in decision-making under stressful situations. Our new data derived from each of these

separate cognitive tests provide convincing evidence of disrupted neurotransmission between cortical and hip-
pocampal circuits in the brain and also suggest that the neurocognitive risks resulting from exposure to cosmic 
radiation are likely to persist indefinitely.
Understanding precisely how GCR particles damage the brain to elicit such long-term behavioral decrements 
necessitates knowledge of the frequency and nature of the interaction of these destructive particles with critical 
brain structures. Highly energetic particles are deeply penetrating, and will produce densely ionizing tracks along 
particle trajectories as they traverse all cell types in the brain. Delta rays emanating from these primary tracks can 
elicit secondary sparsely ionizing events as far as 1 cm away, considerably extending the reach of a single particle’s 
interactions among cells. Taking into account particle dose, linear energy transfer (LET) and fluence/μ 
m2 in rela-
tion to the geometry of critical neuronal structures, we estimate that the mean number of particle traversals in our 
study is between 0.25–11.3 for the soma, 2.5–114 for the dendritic tree and 0.013–0.57 for a particular dendritic 
spine type22. These approximations clearly demonstrate that, while direct hits to the soma and dendritic tree are 
relatively frequent events, those to the spines are not. This also suggests that, if a given particle can ionize targets 
within a 1-cm cylindrical volume as it traverses the brain, then the probability of any neuronal structure incurring 
multiple ionizations during a long-term mission to Mars is likely to exceed unity23. This estimate may also provide 
an explanation for the many dose-independent changes observed (i.e. cognition, neuronal structure, etc.). If even 
very low fluences of cosmic particles are predicted to interact with multiple neural cell types and circuits that 
exhibit unusually high sensitivities, then the overall effect could manifest as an all or nothing response.
Since behavioral decrements can be predictive of structural change, we sought to establish a more conclusive 
cause and effect by interrogating neurons in those regions of the brain interrogated specifically by our battery 
of distinct cognitive tasks. Because the mPFC has been implicated as key to complex cognitive behavior includ-
ing decision-making and executive function and is linked to each of our behavioral tasks24, neurons within this 
region were subject to rigorous structural analyses. In the present study, reductions in dendritic complexity found 
at 15 weeks after exposure corroborate past findings under similar irradiation conditions conducted at earlier 
times7, and agree with past results obtained in various hippocampal neurons after exposure to different radiation 
Figure 7. Exposure to cosmic radiation leads to increased neuroinflammation in the prelimbic layer of the 
mPFC. Representative images from left to right illustrate immunohistochemical visualization of ED-1+ cells in 
control, 5 cGy 16O or 5 cGy 48Ti in the PL subfield 15 weeks post-exposure (ED1+ red and toto-3 counterstain; top). 
Quantitative analysis demonstrates that, compared to respective controls, irradiation leads to increased numbers 
of activated microglia 15 and 27 weeks later (left and right lower panels, respectively). Data are expressed as

types16,19,25. Importantly, these new data provide additional evidence defining a marked and unexpected persis-
tence of cosmic radiation-induced changes in mPFC neuronal structure. Structural changes were also temporally 
coincident with increased PSD-95 puncta and activated microglia. While the functional consequences of irradi-
ation on PSD-95 remain uncertain, past work has shown that in immature neurons, overexpression of PSD-95 
decreases branching of primary dendrites leading to marked reductions of secondary dendrites26. These findings 
are consistent with present observations (Fig. 5), and suggest that radiation-induced overexpression of PSD-95 
inhibits dendritogenesis, with concomitant reductions in the number and density of dendritic spines. Changes 
in PSD-95 could also disrupt synaptic integrity by altering the composition and distribution of proteins and 
receptors residing at the synaptic cleft27,28, and changes in neuroinflammation could actively regulate structural 
plasticity by pruning dendritic arbors and spines29. Thus, given the long-lasting impact of cosmic radiation on 
neuronal structure, inflammation and synaptic protein levels, it is difficult to envision how these collective pro-
cesses would not have an adverse effect on neurotransmission and the cognitive well being of those engaged in 
deep space travel.
To strengthen the causal links between structural and synaptic measurements and cognition, radiation- 
induced changes in dendritic spines and synaptic puncta were plotted against individual behavior performance 
on the OiP task. The majority of the data showed significant correlations between either reduced dendritic spine 
density or increased PSD-95 puncta and lower DI values (Figs 4 and 6). Animal having spine densities below 
30,000/0.026 μ 
m3 or puncta levels above 6000/0.0018 μ 
m3 in the mPFC were likely to exhibit more pronounced 
behavioral decrements on the OiP task (DI ≤ 
 10). Collectively this data indicates the importance of preserving 
the critical structural and synaptic components needed to maintain circuit integrity. Dendritic spines represent 
the structural correlates of learning and memory and are dependent on the correct stoichiometric balance and 
organization of critical synaptic proteins30,31. Therefore, it is not surprising that once spine numbers or synaptic 
protein levels deviate from their optimal levels, neurotransmission and cognition would be compromised. In a 
prior report, behavioral testing was found to increase hippocampal spine density, an effect not observed in ani-
mals exposed to 56Fe particles and subjected to different behavioral paradigms32. Thus, while it is possible that 
behavioral testing can impact spine density and/or synaptic protein levels, in this study, non-irradiated animals 
exhibited much less variability than found in the irradiated cohorts. Thus, these correlations provide compelling 
evidence that low dose cosmic radiation exposure elicits defined structural and molecular changes in neurons that 
are certain to underlie a majority of the marked and persistent neurocognitive side effects observed.
So what does this all mean for a mission to Mars and for NASA’s future plans for deep space exploration? 
Our recent and current data, along with data from other laboratories, have now clearly identified an unexpected 
sensitivity of the CNS to cosmic radiation exposure23. With this realization comes a concomitant understanding 
of the risk for developing cognitive deficits that may predispose astronauts to performance decrements, faulty 
decision-making and longer-term neurodegenerative effects. Given the increased demands, uncertainties and 
variety of stressors inherent in deep space travel, defining acceptable risk specific to radiation exposure remains 
a challenge. While carefully controlled terrestrial based experimentation has elucidated a number of potential 
mechanisms responsible for chronic CNS effects, realistic limitations related to cosmic radiation simulations on 
Earth and the extrapolation of rodent based behavioral studies to the neurocognitive functionality of astronauts 
is not without caveats. Furthermore, outbred rodent strains exhibit marked inter-individual variation in the sus-
ceptibility to develop HZE-induced cognitive impairment, and the results presented here may not extend to other 
rodent strains13,14,17,20, a situation not uncommon to human subjects. Nonetheless, ground based rodent models 
are useful for validating and refining assumptions used in various risk assessment models. Rodents have been 
found to exhibit behavioral parallels with humans on a sequence model of episodic memory33 and to possess 
higher order neuronal structure and sophisticated metacognitive ability thought to be restricted to primates34. 
There are, however, no data that suggest the response of rodent neurons to cosmic radiation would differ in a 
fundamental way from those of humans, and data derived from rodent-based studies can help identify the types 
of potential problems that need to be incorporated in any risk management activity related to human error. Thus, 
the most logical conclusion to draw from these studies is that cosmic radiation exposure poses a real and poten-
tially detrimental neurocognitive risk for prolonged deep space travel. With the growing realization that space 
is a radioactive environment comes the need to more completely define these risks with more certainty through 
continued research. Development of more advanced engineering and biologic countermeasures designed to the 
protect host neuronal circuitry from cosmic radiation exposure are underway, and will certainly be incorporated 
into deep space mission planning. Unlike humankinds’ other great adventures, space is truly the final frontier. 
Our exploration of strange new worlds should not be hampered by the fear of cosmic radiation exposure, but 
rather, inspire robust efforts to advance our understanding of a previously unrecognized problem.
Materials and Methods
Additional experimental procedures can be found in the Supplementary Materials.
Animals, heavy ion irradiation, and tissue harvesting. 
All animal procedures were carried out in 
accordance with National Institutes of Health and Institutional Animal Care guidelines and were approved by the 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California, Irvine and at the Eastern Virginia Medical 
School. Six-month-old male transgenic mice [strain Tg(Thy1-EGFP) MJrsJ, stock no. 007788, The Jackson Laboratory, 
Sacramento, CA] harboring the Thy1- EGFP transgene and 7–9 month old male retired breeder (socially mature) Wistar 
rats (HSD:WI; Harlan Sprague Dawley Inc. Indianapolis, IN) were used in this study. Mice were bred and genotyped 
to confirm the presence of Thy1-EGFP transgene. Charged particles (16O and 48Ti) at 600 MeV/n were generated and 
delivered at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory at dose rates between 
0.05 and 0.25 Gy/min. Dosimetry was performed, and spatial beam uniformity was confirmed by the NSRL 
 
physics staff.

Behavioral testing. 
Separate cohorts of mice and rats exposed to cosmic radiation were subjected to 6 distinct 
 
behavioral paradigms 12 or 24 weeks after irradiation. Separate cohorts of mice were interrogated using the NOR, 
OiP and TO tasks at 12 and 24 weeks, while an additional cohort was used for a fear extinction paradigm and 
EPM task 24 weeks following exposure to quantify additional behavioral performance. Rats were subjected to an 
attentional set shifting paradigm (12 weeks) designed to interrogate functionality in select cortical regions of the 
brain including the mPFC, perirhinal cortex and basal forebrain17. The NOR, OiP and TO tasks rely on intact 
hippocampal, mPFC and perirhinal cortex function35,36. While the NOR task measures the preference for novelty, 
the OiP task is a test of associative recognition memory and the TO task provides a measure of temporal order 
memory, that depend on interactions between the hippocampus, mPFC and perirhinal cortices. Spontaneous 
exploration tasks (NOR, OiP, TO) were conducted as described previously7, using the following expression to 
calculate the DI:
−
×
Time spent exploring novel object
total exploration time
Time spent exploring familiar object
total exploration time
100
Fear extinction follows a modified fear conditioning protocol37 in which repeated trials dissociating the 
tone-shock pairing can be used to measure the rate of reduced freezing or fear extinction. Deficits in this behavior 
have been linked to the infralimbic region of the mPFC and require active learning, thereby provide a measure 
of cognitive flexibility. The elevated plus maze provides a measure of anxiety that can be linked to the amygdala 
(among other regions), by quantifying the time spent and number of entries into an open versus closed arm of 
the maze.
Additional details regarding attentional set shifting, fear extinction and EPM testing can be found in the 
Supplementary Materials.
Confocal imaging, and neuronal morphometry and spine parameters. 
The expression of EGFP in 
specific subsets of neurons provides for the high-resolution imaging and quantification of neuronal structure. In 
previous studies, we demonstrated that the cosmic radiation types reduced dendritic complexity of hippocampal 
granule cell and mPFC neurons. Here, we have extended our morphometric analyses of neurons in the prelim-
bic layer of the mPFC to extended post-irradiation times (15 weeks), using the same rigorously defined mor-
phometric and experimental criteria19. Briefly, all morphometric parameters and spine density were quantified 
from reconstructed neurons in a region of interest (1.2 × 
 1.2 mm2) of the prelimbic cortex (bregma 2.80 mm 
to 1.50 mm). For dendritic analyses, 100 μ 
m thick sections from the prelimbic cortex were prepared for confo-
cal imaging. Three sections per animal were used to generate Z-stacks from five animals using a Nikon Eclipse 
TE 2000-U microscope (Nikon, Japan). Quantification included the dendritic structure of both apical and basal 
dendrites of L1 to L6 neurons. An algorithm for tracing dendritic filaments was used to reconstruct the entire 
dendritic tree, where tracing originates from the soma and terminates near terminal dendritic diameter thresh-
olds. Reconstructed dendritic segments can be analyzed under higher magnification for dendritic spines that can 
be labeled, manually verified, morphologically categorized, and quantified. All morphometric parameters were 
validated from an independent series of pilot reconstructions in both manual and semiautomatic modes. Images 
were then compared for accuracy and consistency to ensure that selected parameters represented actual variations 
in dendritic structure. Parameters of neuronal structure that were identified and quantified through image recon-
struction and deconvolution using the IMARIS software suite (Bitplane Inc.) included the cell body, dendritic and 
axonal length, branching and branch points, dendritic complexity, spines, and boutons.
The number of dendritic spines was determined by summing total number of spines in the same region of 
interest, where spine density was calculated by dividing total dendritic length by the total number of spines. 
Spines were classified based on the following morphological parameters: (i) Stubby spine: Stubby spines are 
devoid of a neck, diameter of the head is almost equal to the total length of the spine. (ii) Long spine: Length of 
neck is greater than its diameter and the head is clearly distinguishable but has a diameter less than the length of 
the neck. (iii) Mushroom spine: Mushroom spines have a large head and a narrow neck, diameter of the head is 
greater than the width of the neck. (iv) Filopodia spine: Total spine length is greater than 1 μ 
m with the complete 
absence of a head.
Immunohistochemistry of synaptic proteins. 
Coronal sections of the brain were immunostained for 
the quantification of PSD-95 as described previously19.
Statistical analysis. 
Data are expressed as mean ± 
 SEM of 4 to 10 independent measurements. The level 
of significance was assessed by one-way ANOVA along with Bonferroni’s multiple comparison using Prism data 
analysis software (v6.0). Correlation of spine density or PSD-95 puncta to individual DIs was performed using the 
Spearman rank test. Statistical significance was assigned at P < 0.05.
