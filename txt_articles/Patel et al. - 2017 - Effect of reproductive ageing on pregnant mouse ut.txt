Key points
r Older pregnant women have a greater risk of operative delivery, still birth and post-term
induction.
r This suggests that maternal age can influence the timing of birth and processes of parturition.
r We have found that increasing maternal age in C57BL/6J mice is associated with prolongation
of gestation and length of labour.
r Older pregnant mice also had delayed progesterone withdrawal and impaired myometrial
function.
r Uterine ageing and labour dysfunction should be investigated further in older primigravid
women.
Abstract Advanced maternal age (�35 years) is associated with increased rates of operative
delivery, stillbirth and post-term labour induction. The physiological causes remain uncertain,
although impaired myometrial function has been implicated. To investigate the hypothesis that
maternal age directly influences successful parturition, we assessed the timing of birth and
fetal outcome in pregnant C57BL/6J mice at 3 months (young) and 5 months (intermediate) vs.
8months(older)ofageusinginfraredvideorecording.Serumprogesteroneprofiles,myometrium
and cervix function, and mitochondrial electron transport chain complex enzymatic activities
were also examined. Older pregnant mice had a longer mean gestation and labour duration
(P < 0.001), as well as reduced litter size (P < 0.01) vs. 3-month-old mice. Older mice did
not exhibit the same decline in serum progesterone concentrations as younger mice. Cervical
tissues from older mice were more distensible than younger mice (P < 0.05). Oxytocin receptor
and connexin-43 mRNA expression were reduced in the myometrium from 8-month-old vs.
3-month-old mice (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 respectively) in tandem with more frequent but shorter
duration spontaneous myometrial contractions (P < 0.05) and an attenuated contractile response
to oxytocin. Myometrial mitochondrial copy number was reduced in older mice, although there
were no age-induced changes to the enzymatic activities of the mitochondrial electron transport
chain complexes. In conclusion, 8-month-old mice provide a useful model of reproductive ageing.
The present study has identified potential causes of labour dysfunction amenable to investigation
in older primigravid women.

Introduction
Over recent decades, the average age of primigravid
mothers
in
developed
countries
has
increased
progressively,
with
women
(including
multiparous
women)
over
the
age
of
35
years
comprising
a
significant
proportion
of
the
pregnant
population
(Office for National Statistics for England and Wales,
2013) (Matthews & Hamilton, 2014). Such trends are
accompanied by a simultaneous rise in the incidence of
pregnancy complications such as post-term induction,
failuretoprogressinlabour,andpostpartumhaemorrhage
(Ecker et al. 2001; Roos et al. 2010; Yogev et al. 2010).
Advanced maternal age is also associated with an increase
in Caesarean section and instrumental delivery rates
(Smith et al. 2008; Ludford et al. 2012; Karabulut et al.
2013; Herstad et al. 2015).
There is limited understanding of the links between
maternalageandtheprocessesofthetimingofparturition.
Spontaneous contraction of isolated human pregnant and
non-pregnant myometrium ex vivo is reported to decline
with advancing maternal age, with the myometrium from
pregnant women exhibiting increased multiphasic contra-
ctions (Smith et al. 2008; Arrowsmith et al. 2012). Other
studies have suggested that myometrial tissue responds
less effectively to uterotonic agents such as oxytocin or
prostaglandins with increasing maternal age (Greenberg
et al. 2007; Arrowsmith et al. 2012), which is supported
by the observation that women of older age have a greater
probability of requiring oxytocin-augmentation for the
induction of labour (Adashek et al. 1993; Main et al. 2000).
Age
may
also
influence
cervical
ripening.
A
retrospective, cohort study revealed that a maternal age
above 30 years was an independent and significant
predictor of cervical ripening failure in response to
prostaglandin E2 (Melamed et al. 2010), suggesting an
abnormal age-related timing of cervical ripening or
impaired prostaglandin E2 responsiveness. A maternal
age greater than 35 years has also been implicated as
an independent risk factor of ‘failure to progress in
labour’ during the first stage of labour, which is normally
associated with cervical dilatation and regular myometrial
contractions (Sheiner et al. 2002).
Studies in rodents may provide further insights into the
responisble mechanism and improve upon experimental
control and tissue availability compared to the clinical
setting, although they have seldom been undertaken in
appropriately aged and nulliparous rodents. Holinka et al.
(1978) suggested that multiparous mice at the extreme
limit of reproductive viability (11–12 months) have
extended gestations compared to younger multiparous
mice (3–7 months), possibly as a result of changes in
the maternal progesterone status (Holinka et al. 1978).
However, the impact of maternal age in nulliparous mice
at an age more relevant to older pregnant women (i.e.
at the initial stages of reproductive ageing; �8 months)
was not investigated. In another study, spontaneous
myometrial contractility in vitro was reduced in tissues
from
older
24-week-old
Wistar
rats
compared
to
8-week-old animals, although this was neither related
to the expression of myometrium contraction associated
proteins, nor plasma lipid or pregnancy-related hormone
profiles. There was also no evidence of a delay in timing
of delivery (Elmes et al. 2015) suggesting that their model
does not reflect adequately the situation in older pregnant
women. A possible reason for this is that a rat age of
24 weeks is more representative of an 18–20-year-old
adult rather than a 35-year-old (Sengupta, 2013).
The present study aimed to develop a more appropriate
mouse model of reproductive ageing to address parallels
with older (�35 years) nulliparous pregnant women and
explore the impact on gestational age at parturition, as
well as uterine and cervical function. We hypothesized
that the timing/initiation of labour would be prolonged
in older dams as a consequence of a delay in parturition
signals affecting the physiological ripening of the cervix
and the activation of myometrium. We also explored the
notion that the ability of the myometrium to contract at
term would deteriorate in older mothers as a result of
age-related mitochondrial dysfunction.
Methods
Ethical approval
Institutional Animal Welfare Committee approval was not
required because no regulated procedures were used for
the present study. No animal was anaesthetized or under-
went any surgical procedure. All animals were treated
and killed in accordance with the Animals (Scientific
Procedures) Act 1986 guidelines and the experimental
details conform with the animal ethics checklist (Grundy,
2015).
Animals
C57BL/6J mice (weighing 21.5–30.5 g, aged 3–8 months;
Charles
River
Laboratories,
Margate,
UK)
were
maintained under controlled conditions (25 °C, 12:12 h

light/dark cycle) and received water and standard chow
diet ad libitum. Females (all ages) were mated with
C57BL/6J males (aged 3–4 months; Charles River
Laboratories). Conception was determined by the pre-
sence of a vaginal plug (day 0 of gestation). A total
of 510 mice were used for the present study. This
number comprised non-pregnant 3-month-old (n = 60),
5-month-old (n = 50) and 8-month-old (n = 60)
mice; late pregnant 3-month-old (n = 90), 5-month-old
(n = 40) and 8-month-old (n = 110) mice; and full-term
3-month-old (n = 8) and 8-month-old (n = 8) mice; as
well as 84 pups born to the full-term mice.
Development of the mouse model of advanced
maternal age
Three age groups of female mice were selected for
experimentation; all were capable of reproduction (3,
5 and 8 months of age). This was informed by pre-
vious studies of the oestrous cycle in ageing C57BL/6J
mice (Nelson et al. 1982; Felicio et al. 1984), which
reported that peak cycling occurred at 3 to 5 months
of age but that, by 9 months, normal cycling was
disrupted and average cycle lengths became progressively
longer, indicative of reproductive ageing. Virgin C57BL/6J
mice at 8 months of age were used to model human
nulliparous advanced maternal age. The 3-month-old
mice acted as controls, assuming this to be a period
of maximal reproductive potential. The 5-month-old
mice represented an intermediate age group for some
experiments.Whereappropriate,experimentaltechniques
were repeated with age matched non-pregnant female
mice.
Tissue collection
Mice
were
killed
by
cervical
dislocation
and
exsanguination, in accordance with Schedule 1 of
The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. To control
for changes to uterine smooth muscle during the oestrous
cycle, all non-pregnant tissues were collected in the
oestrous stage of the cycle, as confirmed by the presence of
large cornified epithelial cells with very few or no visible
nuclei in vaginal fluid collected by daily vaginal smearing.
Myometrium and cervixes from time mated late pre-
gnant mice were collected on day 18 of gestation and blood
samples for progesterone analyses taken between days 15
and 19 of gestation. Blood samples were immediately
collected by cardiac puncture. Following centrifugation
(10 min at 13 000 g), serum was aspirated and stored at
–80 °C until analysis.
Uterine horns and cervices were dissected and placentas
and fetuses were removed. Fetuses were killed by
destruction of the brain and decapitation, in accordance
with
Schedule
1.
Mouse
uterine
horns
were
cut
longitudinally down the midline, and the endometrium
wasgentlyremovedwithacottonbud.Small,fullthickness
myometrium strips were dissected longitudinally with the
fibre structure and mounted vertically in the organ bath.
Uterine and cervical tissues were either immediately
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for DNA extraction
and protein isolation, placed into RNAlater (Ambion,
Warrington, UK) in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions for RNA extraction and stored at −80 °C,
or transferred to ice-cold PBS (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole,
UK) for isometric tension recording. Cervical biopsies for
histological analysis were fixed by overnight immersion
in 10% (v/v) formal saline solution (formaldehyde
solution 10% v/v in 0.9% NaCl solution; Fisher Scientific,
Loughborough, UK) and then embedded in paraffin.
Non-pregnant uterine and cervical tissues were collected
and processed similarly.
Serum progesterone assay
Serum progesterone concentrations from primiparous
mice through late gestation (n = 5–8) were determined
using a progesterone enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay kit (Enzo Life Sciences, Exeter, UK).
RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis
Myometrium (30 mg) was homogenized (TissueLyser;
Qiagen, Manchester, UK) and total RNA was extracted
from the lysate (RNeasy mini kit; Qiagen) in accordance
with the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA sample quality
and concentrations were verified by gel electrophoresis
and spectrophotometric analysis using a NanoDrop
ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Labtech International Ltd,
Uckfield, UK). RNA (500 ng) was used to synthesize
cDNA using 0.25 μg of random hexanucleotide primers
(Promega, Southampton, UK) and 200 IU of Superscript
III (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK).
DNA isolation
Total genomic DNA was extracted from 25 mg of myo-
metrial tissue. Tissue was homogenized in 160 μl of
PBS (Sigma-Aldrich). DNA was extracted from the lysate
using the ReliaPrep gDNA Purification kit (Promega)
in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
DNA was quantified (ng μl−1) and the DNA integrity
was checked (NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer).
Dilution was standardized to 50 ng μl−1 in a volume
of 100 μl using RNase/DNase free water (Qiagen) and
samples were sonicated for 10 min (Pulsatron 55; Kerry
Ultrasonics Ltd, Hitchin, UK) to shear the DNA prior
to mitochondrial/nuclear genome ratio (Mt/N) ratio
determination by a quantitative real-time PCR.

Quantitative real-time PCR
A quantitative real-time PCR was performed as described
by Bustin et al. (2008). SYBR green chemistry (2x
QuantiFAST SYBR green; Qiagen) was performed on a
RotorGene 6000 (Qiagen) using the primers listed in
Table 1. Forward and reverse primers were optimized to
be used at working concentrations of 300 nM in a total
reaction volume of 10 μl. A pre-PCR cycle was run for
5 min at 95 °C followed by 42 cycles of 95 °C for a
10 s denaturation step, followed by 60 °C for a 30 s
combined annealing/extension step. Test samples (2 μl
of cDNA) were run in duplicate in parallel with cDNA
standards of known gene copy number abundance (108 to
101 copies). Melt-curve analysis was performed to confirm
the presence of one single product and non-template
controls were run to assess genomic DNA contamination.
Qunatification cycle (also referred to as cycle threshold)
values were used for analysis and abundance data were
obtained for test samples by the generation of a standard
curve based on the quantified cDNA. Quantification
data for the genes of interest were expressed relative
to the most stable reference genes from a panel of 3
[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH),
β-actin and β2 microglobulin (B2M)], using GeNorm
software (Vandesompele et al., 2002).
Infrared video camera recording of mouse parturition
Primiparous late pregnant (day 17 of gestation onwards,
3 and 8 months of age, n = 8 for each) females were
singly housed. Females were monitored continuously
using infrared video cameras (600TVL Eyeball Dome;
Qvis, Austin, TX, USA) from the appearance of the first
pup until the completion of parturition. Minimal nesting
bedding was provided (Enviro-dri; Shepherd Speciality
Papers, Watertown, TN, USA) to prevent the camera view
being obscured. Mice were maintained under controlled
conditions (25 °C, 12:12 h light/dark cycle: 07.00–19.00 h)
with access to standard chow and water ad libitum.
Cameras were connected to a Zeus Lite HDMI LX 4
Channel Full D1 Networked CCTV Recorder DVR 1TB
Hard Drive (Qvis), which recorded continuously with the
tracked time and date. Litter size, live pup weights and any
pup mortality were recorded. Mice that failed to deliver
after 21 days were culled and the uteri were dissected to
confirm pregnancy loss. The precise time of birth was
determined from the video recording by the appearance
and complete delivery of the first pup, and gestation
length calculated (days). Total parturition duration (h)
was determined as the time between the complete delivery
of the first pup to the complete delivery of the final pup.
Ex vivo isometric tension measurements of mouse
myometrium
Myometrial muscle strips (�5 × 2 × 2 mm) were dissected
from mouse uterine horns from non-pregnant females
in oestrous or late pregnant dams (gestation day 18).
Strips were mounted in a 10 ml of organ bath chamber
(Panlab 8 Chamber Organ Bath System; ADInstruments,
Oxford, UK) and maintained in oxygenated physiological
salt solution (PSS) (in mM): 119 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.17
MgSO4,25NaHCO3,1.18KH2PO4,0.025EDTA,6glucose
and 2.5 CaCl2; 37 °C, 95% air–5% CO2; pH 7.4; BOC
Gases, Guildford, UK). A resting tension of 29 mN (2×
slack length) was applied before an equilibration period
(45 min) to establish spontaneous contractions. After
10 min of baseline measurement, spontaneous contra-
ctile activity (minimum 1 h) and the response to the
contractile agonist oxytocin were evaluated (10−12 to 10−7
M oxytocin concentration response curve; Syntocinon;
Alliance Pharmaceuticals, Chippenham, UK). The contra-
ctile capacity of each myometrial tissue strip in response

to a depolarizing K+ solution (PSS with 60 mM KCl
substituted for NaCl) was measured after recording the
spontaneous contractility.
All data were recorded and analysed using LabChart,
version 6 (ADInstruments). Contractile periods were
assessed using mean integral tension (MIT; the sum of
the contraction integrals divided by the duration of the
period assessed and then corrected for myometrial active
tissue wet weight, expressed as mN·s g–1). Contraction
force was calculated as the mean amplitude of contra-
ctions over the assessment period. Contraction frequency
was expressed as contractions s–1, and the duration of a
contraction as the time (s) between start and end. Because
oxytocin dose–response curves were not sigmoidal, EC50
and Emax values could not be calculated, the slope of
the linear response across the concentration range was
analysed.
Ex vivo tensile strength measurements of mouse
cervix
Cervical tensile strength was measured as described
previously (Read et al. 2007). Intact cervices from
non-pregnant in oestrous or late pregnant (day 18)
females were dissected and all vaginal tissue was removed
(n = 6–9). The preparation was mounted in a 10
ml organ bath chamber in oxygenated PSS (37 °C).
Cervices were initially held at a slack length (at which
a further 0.25 mm stretch led to an increase in passive
tension) and equilibrated for 15 min. The inner diameter
(resting diameter of cervical os) was measured as 0 mm
stretch and the os was then isometrically stretched
incrementally (1 mm every 2 min) until tension plateaued
or, infrequently, when the tissue snapped/tore. The force
required to distend the cervix and the tension exerted
by the stretched tissue were analysed, force–strain curves
generated and the slope of the linear component measured
as a gauge of tissue elasticity/stiffness.
Histological studies in mouse cervix
Whole intact cervical samples from non-pregnant females
in oestrous or late pregnant (day 18) were fixed
overnight [10% (v/v) formaldehyde solution in 0.9%
NaCl solution; Fisher Scientific], followed by automated
processing (TP1020 tissue processor; Leica Biosystems,
Milton Keynes, UK) and wax embedding (EG1150
heated paraffin embedding module; Leica Biosystems).
Paraffin wax sections (5–10 μm longitudinally through
cervical samples) were mounted on SuperFrost Plus

the bicinchoninic acid method using a commercially

activities of the electron transport chain complexes were
expressed in units mg–1 homogenate protein content.
To evaluate myometrial mitochondrial density, citrate
synthase activity was adjusted for protein content.
Statistical analysis
Student’s t test was used to assess data between two groups.
One-way ANOVA was used followed by an all pairwise
multiple comparison (Tukey’s test) when comparing three
or more groups (GraphPad Prism, version 5.0; GraphPad
SoftwareInc.,SanDiego,CA,USA).Thecomparisonspre-
sented are between pregnant and non-pregnant animals
at the same age and between animals at different ages with
the same pregnancy status.
Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant; n is the number
of animals or tissues used per test group. Linear regression
analyses were carried out using Stata, version 11.2
(StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) and P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant. Pup weight was
calculated as an average per litter. For assessment of
myometrium spontaneous contractile activity, when there
was more than one tissue strip per animal, the average
value across all related strips was used. For assessment
of oxytocin augmented concentration responses, the rate
of change in MIT (slope) in response to increasing
concentrations of oxytocin was calculated for each myo-
metrium tissue strip and the results compared generalized
least squares regression with robust standard errors
clustered by animal.
Power calculations were carried out based on published
data. Animal numbers were calculated to give a minimum
of 80% power to detect a minimum of 20% difference
between groups at P < 0.05.
Results
Parturition in mice of advancing reproductive age
Eight mice per group were monitored in pregnancy and
at delivery. Of the 8-month-old mice, only six delivered at
term and 25% failed to maintain pregnancy (confirmed
by uterine dissection post day 21). All mice, regardless of
age group, were confirmed to be pregnant on gestation
day 15, although 63% of the older mice had some
degree of intrauterine fetal loss and/or fetal resorption.
All 3-month-old mice delivered at term, with no fetal
loss. Older 8-month-old mice demonstrated increased
gestationallength(20.1±0.2days,n=6vs.19.1±0.1days
for 3-month-old mice, n = 8; P < 0.001) (Fig. 1A).
Eight-month-old pregnant mice also had longer labour

3-month-oldmice,n=8;P<0.001)(Fig.1B)andreduced
litter size (4.8 ± 0.9 pups, n = 6 litters vs. 7.5 ± 0.2 pups
for 3-month-old mice; n = 8 litters; P < 0.01) (Fig. 1C).
Reproductive age had no effect on average pup weight per
litter; 8-month-old mice (1.59 ± 0.07 g, 29 pups from
n = 6 litters vs. 1.54 ± 0.04 g, 60 pups from n = 8 litters).
Linear
regression
analyses
were
undertaken
to
determine whether the prolongation of gestation and
duration of labour in older mice could be explained
not only by an influence of maternal age, but also
mechanistically because of the reduction in litter size. The
impact of older age on gestation length was 1.03 days
[95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.59–1.47; P < 0.001],
which remained significant after adjustment for litter
size. The effect of maternal age on gestation length was
0.64 days (95% CI = 0.12–1.16; P < 0.05). Litter size
had no significant influence on gestation length for either
3- or 8-month-old mice (3-month slope: 0.04 ± 0.19;
r2 = 0.007, P = 0.848; 8-month slope: –0.16 ± 0.08;
r2 = 0.523, P = 0.104) (Fig. 1D). The impact of maternal
age on labour duration was 2.67 h (95% CI = 1.93–3.41;
P < 0.001) after adjustment for litter size; the effect
of maternal age on labour duration was 1.77 h (95%
CI = 1.14–2.39; P < 0.001).
Progesterone measurements in late gestation
The serum progesterone profile differed between 3- and
8-month-oldmice;in3-month-oldmice,theprogesterone
concentration fell between gestation days 15 and 18
(109.5 ± 22.55 ng ml−1 vs. 30.5 ± 6.59; P < 0.01)
(Fig. 2), whereas this decline was not observed in older

mice between gestation days 15 and 19 (80.9 ± 12.13 to
58.4 ± 11.57 ng ml−1) (Fig. 2).
Effect of reproductive ageing on cervical distensibility
Maximal cervical distension (increase in cervical os
diameter) was similar in non-pregnant mice aged 3
and 5 months but, at 8 months, was increased 1.7-fold
compared to both 3-month-old (10.6 ± 0.2 mm, n = 8
vs. 6.2 ± 0.2 mm, n = 6; P < 0.001) and 5-month-old
(6.3 ± 0.2 mm, n = 8; P < 0.001) non-pregnant
mice (Fig. 3A and B). In late pregnancy, cervices from
8-month-old mice were more distensible compared to
the 3-month-old mice (19.3 ± 0.4 mm, n = 6 vs.
16.0 ± 0.5 mm, n = 9; P < 0.001) and those of the
5-month-old mice more distensible than 3-month-old
animals (18.0 ± 0.3 mm, n = 6; P < 0.01) (Fig. 3A
and B).
Maximum distension was greater in mice of all ages in
late pregnancy compared to non-pregnant mice, implying
that cervical softening had occurred in all groups by day
18 of gestation. The maximal distension for late pre-
gnant cervical tissues compared to maternal age matched
non-pregnant animals was 2.59-, 2.88- and 1.82-fold
higher for 3-, 5- and 8-month-old mice, respectively
(n = 6–9; P < 0.0001 for all) (Fig. 3A and B).
Cervical stiffness was determined as the slope of cervical
distensionstress–straincurvesshowninFig.3A.Therewas
no difference in cervical stiffness between non-pregnant
3- and 5-month-old mice (7.1 ± 0.2 g mm−1, n = 6; 6.6 0.2
g mm−1, n = 8, respectively) but stiffness at both ages was
approximately twice that at 8 months (3.4 ± 0.2 g mm−1,
n = 8) (P < 0.001 for both comparisons) (Fig. 3C). Slopes
of the cervical distension stress–strain curves for all ages of
late pregnant mice were similar and all were lower than age
matched non-pregnant animals by a factor of 0.32, 0.27
and 0.49 for 3-, 5- and 8-month-old mice, respectively
(n = 6–9; P < 0.0001 for all) (Fig. 3C).
Determination of collagen in cervical tissues
Masson’s
trichrome
blue
staining
(expressed
as
a
percentage of the total cervical area) was similar between
thethreeagegroupsinthenon-pregnantandlatepregnant
cervical tissues. The transition from non-pregnant to late
pregnancy in all age groups was associated with reduced
cervical collagen content; a 28% decline in 3-month-old
mice compared to age matched non-pregnant animals
(63.0 ± 4.2% to 34.6 ± 3.5%; P < 0.001), a 29% reduction
in 5-month-old mice (64.1 ± 3.4% to 34.9 ± 1.7%;
P < 0.001) and a 32% reduction for 8-month-old mice
(69.8 ± 2.4% to 37.8 ± 2.1%; P < 0.001) (n = 6 for

Expression of MMP2 in cervical tissues
MMP2 staining was localized in the columnar and
squamous epithelium, as well as the stroma, in both
non-pregnant and late pregnant cervical tissues for all
three ages. MMP2 protein expression (mean ± SEM
arbitrary units of positivity) was not significantly different
between the three age groups in non-pregnant or

P < 0.01, n = 8 for both groups) mice (Fig. 6A). There
were no other age-related differences in expression across
groups. Cx43 expression was low in non-pregnant myo-
metrium from all age groups compared to late pregnancy,
which was associated with increased expression in mice
of all ages (6.16-, 9.12- and 8.17- fold change for 3-,
5- and 8-month-old mice, respectively, compared to
non-pregnant tissues; P < 0.001, n = 8 for all groups)

differences in OXTR expression levels across groups. Late
pregnancy was associated with increased OXTR mRNA

Spontaneous contractile activity of non-pregnant

MITvaluesforspontaneousmyometrialcontractionswere
similar between all age groups in both non-pregnant and
late pregnant cohorts (n = 8 mice per group, average
of four tissue strips per animal) (Fig. 7A). Spontaneous
contractile activity was significantly higher in all late pre-
gnant mice compared to non-pregnant mice of all age
groups (P < 0.001, P < 0.01, P < 0.05, n = 8 mice per
group, average of four strips per animal).
The contractile response (mean peak amplitude)
induced by 40 mM K+ PSS) was similar in the myo-
metriumfromallnon-pregnantagegroups.Inthelatepre-
gnant mouse, the numerical age-associated reduction in
the contraction amplitude was not significant (P = 0.073)
(Fig. 7B). High K+-induced contraction amplitudes were
significantly increased in the myometrium from late pre-
gnant mice compared to tissues from non-pregnant mice
in all three age categories (P < 0.01, P < 0.05, n = 8 mice
for each group, average of four tissue strips per animal)

A, tension generated by the cervix is plotted as a function of incremental stretch of the cervical os diameter as
stress–strain curves. Tissues obtained from non-pregnant 3-month-old (n = 6, open circles), 5-month-old (n = 8,
open triangles) and 8-month-old (n = 8, open squares) mice, as well as late pregnant 3-month-old (n = 9, closed
circles), 5-month-old (n = 6, closed triangles) and 8-month-old (n = 6, closed squares) mice. Cervical stretch
(distension) means were different between non-pregnant compared to late pregnant mice of all three age groups
(∗∗∗P < 0.001). Cervices obtained from non-pregnant 3-month-old [NP(3), n = 6, open bar with diagonal lines],

n = 6, closed grey bar] and 8-month-old [LP(8), n = 6, closed dark grey bar] mice for (B) and (C). B, transition
from a non-pregnant to pregnant state, significantly increased maximal cervical distension in all three age groups
(∗∗∗P < 0.001). Advance in age from 3 to 8 months and 5 to 8 months in non-pregnant mice, as well as from 3
to 5 to 8 months in late pregnant mice, also significantly increased maximal cervical distension (∗∗P < 0.01 and
∗∗∗P < 0.001). C, cervical stiffness as determined by the slope of cervical distension stress–strain curves. Transition
from a non-pregnant to pregnant state, significantly reduced cervical stiffness in 3-, 5- and 8-month-old mice
(∗∗∗P < 0.001). Advance in age from 3 to 8 months and 5 to 8 months in non-pregnant mice also significantly
reduced cervical stiffness (∗∗∗P < 0.001); however, an advance in age did not change cervical stiffness in tissues
from late pregnant mice. Data were analysed using ANOVA followed by an all pairwise multiple comparison Tukey’s
test and are presented as the mean ± SEM for (A), (B) and (C).

mtDNA content in the myometrium
The mtDNA copy number (Mt/N ratio) was 26% lower
in the myometrium from non-pregnant 8-month-old
(23.56 ± 1.59 copy number) compared to non-pregnant
3-month-old (31.75 ± 2.07; P < 0.05) mice (Fig. 9). There
was an age-related decline in mtDNA copy number in late
pregnant myometrium from 3 months (48.63 ± 1.67) to
5 months (38.61 ± 1.60; –25%; P < 0.01) from 3 months
to 8 months (28.80 ± 1.72; –41%; P < 0.001) and from
5 months to 8 months (–21%; P < 0.01) (Fig. 9). The
mtDNA copy number was higher in late pregnant than
non-pregnant myometrium from 3-month-old (53%;
P<0.001)and5-month-old(34%;P<0.01)mice(Fig.9).
Mitochondrial electron transport chain enzyme
activities in the myometrium
Figure 10A demonstrates that citrate synthase activity in
myometrial tissue protein was not significantly affected by
age in either non-pregnant (3 vs. 8 months; P = 0.896,
n = 8 for both groups) or late pregnant mice (3 vs.
8 months; P = 0.952, n = 8 for both groups). Citrate
synthase enzyme activity was numerically similar in
late pregnant mouse myometrium compared to the
non-pregnant state for both age sets; the differences were
not significant (n = 8 for all groups) (Fig. 10A).
In tissues from the same groups of animals, complex I
(NADH dehydrogenase) activity in myometrial protein
was not modified by age in either non-pregnant (3-
vs. 8-month-old; P = 0.465) or late pregnant mice (3-
vs. 8-month-old; P = 0.075) (Fig. 10B). Myometrial
tissue NADH dehydrogenase activity was not significantly
altered by pregnancy in either age group compared to the
non-pregnant state (Fig. 10B).
Similarly,
complex
II
(succinate
dehydrogenase)
activity was not significantly altered by age in both
non-pregnant (3 vs. 8 months; P = 0.205) and
late pregnant mice (3 vs. 8 months; P = 0.654)
(Fig. 10C). However, succinate dehydrogenase activity was
significantly increased by pregnancy in the myometrium
from both 3- and 8-month-old mice (P < 0.001, P < 0.01,
respectively) (Fig. 10C). Succinate dehydrogenase activity
was significantly higher in the myometrium from pre-
gnant 3-month-old (64%) and 8-month-old (43%)
mice compared to age-matched non-pregnant controls
(P < 0.001 and 0.01, respectively).
Complex III (ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase)
activity also was not significantly altered by age in
non-pregnant (3 vs. 8 months; P = 0.299) and late pre-
gnant mice (3 vs. 8 months; P = 0.399) (Fig. 10D). For

Figure 7. Effect of maternal age on spontaneous contractile activity in the myometrium from
non-pregnant and late pregnant mice
Myometrium was obtained from non-pregnant 3-month-old [NP(3), n = 32 strips from n = 8, open bars with
diagonal lines], late pregnant 3-month-old [LP(3), n = 32 strips from n = 8, open bars], non-pregnant 5-month-old
[NP(5), n = 32 strips from n = 8, closed grey bar with diagonal lines], late pregnant 5-month-old [LP(5), n = 32
strips from n = 8, closed grey bar], non-pregnant 8-month-old [NP(8), n = 32 strips from n = 8, closed dark
grey bar with diagonal lines] and late pregnant 8-month-old [LP(8), n = 32 strips from n = 8, closed dark grey

this did not reach significance (Fig. 10D).
Discussion
The present study confirmed the validity of using
8-month-old pregnant C57BL/6J mice, a common trans-
genic mouse strain, as a model of reproductive ageing in
relation to parturition by demonstrating that maternal
age was associated not only with prolonged gestation,
but also greater duration of labour. Mechanistically, this
wasassociatedwithanabsenceofprogesteronewithdrawal
at term in older mice and disrupted uterine priming
activation, although the process of cervical softening
appeared to be unaffected. There was also a significant
reduction in mtDNA copy number in the myometrium
from older mice, which could contribute to impaired
contractile activity via a reduction in overall ATP synthesis
or altered intracellular Ca2+ regulation
The impact of mouse maternal age on gestation
length and labour duration
Accurate evaluation of timing of birth demonstrated that
the older the age of mice at conception, the greater the
probability of prolonged pregnancies and longer labours
compared to younger mice. This supports previous data

reporting a marked increase in gestation length seen with
advancing maternal age across various species including
mice and humans (Asdell, 1929; Terrill & Hazel, 1947;
Brakel et al. 1952; Soderwall et al. 1960; Moore, 1963;
Holinka et al. 1978; Silk et al. 1993; Jolly et al. 2000; Roos
et al. 2010). The only previous study of aged C57BL/6J
mice used proven breeders, rather than virgin mice, up to
the age of 11–12 months and reported a gestation increase
of 2.2 days (Holinka et al. 1978). Our data show that
the length of gestation in primiparous C57BL/6J mice is
prolonged from 8 months, which is an age that is more
relevant to the human situation.
Labour duration was also significantly lengthened in
oldermice;previousanimalstudieshavenotexaminedthis
in any detail, as far as can be determined. Our data agree,
however, with observations on reproductive ageing in
humans where the length of labour and risk of prolonged
labour increases with advancing maternal age (Greenberg
et al. 2007). There are a number of possible explanations
for the maternal age-related prolonged gestation length
in the mouse model, although the most probable is the
observed absence of an effective progesterone withdrawal,
which is essential for the onset of parturition in rodents

(Weiss, 2000). Young animals showed a reduction in
progesterone (72%) the day before delivery; in contrast,
olderanimalsmaintainedprogesteroneconcentrationsthe
day before delivery (only 28% reduction). Of interest,
despite the lack of progesterone withdrawal, the older
mice still went into labour. This brings into question the
role of progesterone withdrawal in labour onset, although
we cannot rule out the possibility that progesterone
withdrawal occurs later and more quickly in older mothers
and was not detected by our daily measurements up to
19 days. The apparent lack of progesterone withdrawal
could also represent a disruption in the luteolysis pathway
that inhibits/delays the progesterone decline in older mice.
This was not assessed in the present study, although it has
been reported that a significant decline in murine corpus
luteum function during pregnancy normally only occurs
at 10–11 months of age in mice (Harman & Talbert, 1970).
One study of the effect of age on maternal progesterone
concentrations in term parturient rats aged 8 and 24 weeks
showed no difference, although this model was not one of
advanced reproductive age (Elmes et al. 2015).
We also identified a negative relationship between
reproductiveageatconceptionandlittersizeatterm.Older
mice delivered smaller litters and had a greater incidence
of stillbirth, with a small number of older mice failing
to deliver by 22 days of gestation, most probably as a
result of pup resorption. A reduction in litter size in older
animals has been reported previously in various species

2012). Increased rates of resorption of conceptuses and
intrauterine fetal deaths, as well as stillbirth rates, have also
been reported in ageing rodents (Talbert, 1971; Holinka
et al. 1979; Niggeschulze & Kast, 1994; Akiyama et al. 2006;
Lopes et al. 2009; Kong et al. 2012).
The reduction in litter size in older mothers in the
present study supports data from humans indicating that
miscarriage increases with maternal age (Nybo Andersen
etal.2000;Nagaokaetal.2011;Khaliletal.2013;Qiaoetal.
2014). Stillbirth and fetal loss are also common risk factors
for mothers of advanced maternal age (Haavaldsen et al.,
2010). Possible causes for fetal loss in older animals in the
present study could be a series of reproductive senescence
changes such as oocyte depletion and poor oocyte quality
in aged ovaries resulting in the development of fewer
and/or non-viable fetuses (Liu et al. 2013). Decreased
litter size can also be related to an increase in the
number of defective blastocysts (as a consequence
of
abnormal
embryonic
development
patterns)
available for implantation (Day et al. 1991) or a
failure of the aged uterus to maintain embryonic
development (Talbert, 1971; Holinka et al. 1979; Kong
et al. 2012). Furthermore, because 8-month-old mice
tended to be slightly heavier, there may have been some
influence of increased adiposity, although this was not
controlled for in the present study. Unlike the study by
Holinka et al. (1978) conducted in older animals, we
did not find a significant relationship between litter size
and gestation length. However, because this was not the
primary focus of the present study, the numbers were
small; it is possible that this relationship would become
more apparent if more animals had been studied.
The impact of mouse maternal age on cervical
function
Having demonstrated that older mice have prolonged
gestation and labour in parallel with altered progesterone
withdrawal, we determined how this impacted on
reproductive tissues and mechanisms underpinning the
observed age-related phenotypic changes. First, we hypo-
thesized that delayed cervical softening (which occurs
prior to ripening) in older mice could influence gestation
length. Pregnant cervices were generally more distensible
than those of non-pregnant mice, comprising data that
complements the existing body of literature in rodents
(Harkness & Harkness, 1959; Read et al. 2007; Word et al.
2007; Vargis et al. 2012). Cervices from older pregnant
mice still displayed greater distensibility than the younger
pregnant mice but, intriguingly, this did not result in
shorter labours. It suggests, perhaps, that the acute cervical
ripening phase may have more functional importance for
labour progress than cervical softening. We attempted
to examine the contribution of collagen and MMP2
expression (Stygar et al. 2002; van Engelen et al. 2008; Choi
et al. 2009; Akins et al. 2011) to these changes in cervix
biomechanics and softening using immunolocalization
techniques. There were no apparent age-related changes
in collagen and MMP2 in non-pregnant mouse tissues.
This did not mirror the generalized age-associated changes
reported for other collagen rich tissues and organs such as
skin and bone (Wang et al. 2002; Quan et al. 2010).
In pregnant compared to non-pregnant animals, there
was a reduction in cervical tissue collagen content, which
could directly account for the pregnancy related change in
cervical distension. There were no significant differences
in collagen and MMP2 expression in cervices on day 18 of
gestation between younger and older animals. However,
the period for cervical softening is long (days 12–18) and
so differences may not be that apparent when labour is
delayed. Indeed, the role of MMPs has been attributed
more to the breakdown of the extracellular matrix during
the ripening rather than the softening phase of parturition
(Read et al. 2007). Because ripening usually occurs within
24 h of parturition (Read et al. 2007), this may potentially
explain why no significant differences between MMP2
expression in non-pregnant and late pregnant cervical
tissues were detected. Cervical ripening also requires
a drop in progesterone levels (Mahendroo et al. 1999;
Mahendroo, 2012) and, because circulating progesterone
remains relatively stable at the end of gestation in older
8-month-oldmice,thismaybeanindicationthattheonset
of cervical ripening was also perturbed.
Taken
together,
it
is
difficult
to
conclude
that
age-induced changes in collagen and MMP2 cervical
properties and cervical distension have a major impact
on the progress of labour in this model. To confirm this
definitively, further quantitative methods for comparing
soluble and interstitial collagen content should be
performed, along with western blotting and zymography
for MMP2. Also the �24 h delay in parturition seen in
8-month-old mice needs to be taken into account by
examining cervices on day 19 for this group.
The impact of mouse maternal age on uterine
function
We also determined that there was an inherent decrease
in myometrial contractile function in vitro that could
explain the prolongation of pregnancy and labour in
older mice. These data provide additional insight into
previous literature where a negative correlation between
contractile activity and increasing maternal age has been
reported for women (Smith et al. 2008) and in rats
where mature parturient females demonstrate reduced
spontaneous myometrial contractile activity compared to
adolescent rats (Elmes et al. 2015).
At the molecular level, we detected small changes in
Cx43 and OXTR expression in the older group of mice in
parallel with the alterations in contractile frequency and

duration in the myometrium. This suppression may be a
result of the lack of progesterone withdrawal on day 18
in the older mice, or reduced fetal occupancy (reduced
litter size) limiting the influence of uterine stretch on the
inductionofthesecontractileassociatedproteins(Ouetal.
1997; Ou et al. 1998; Lyall et al. 2002; Terzidou et al.
2005). This contrasts with the findings of Elmes et al.
(2015) who reported that maternal age had no influence
on Cx43 protein expression in pregnant rat myometrium
but, as discussed previously, their previous study used
24-week-old rats, which represents full maturity rather
thanthepointofreproductivedeclineasusedinourmodel
(Elmes et al. 2015). The upregulation of Cx43 and OXTR
in late pregnancy compared to the non-pregnant state was
similar to other studies in rodents (Ou et al. 1997; Ou et al.
1998).
The functional impact of Cx43 and OXTR changes
are difficult to determine directly because expression was
still relatively high in older animals. However, assuming
that the majority of the mRNA signal comes from
smooth muscle rather than embedded blood vessels, this
small decrease in mRNA could result in a reduction in
gap junction number and OXTRs in the myometrium
and partly explain the reduction in oxytocin-augmented
contractility in tissues from older mice. These data are
consistent with previous findings that report reduced
contractile responses to oxytocin in the myometrium from
pregnant women aged 40 years and above (Arrowsmith
et al. 2012).
In
the
present
study,
there
was
no
specific
age-induced decrease in spontaneous contractile activity
of non-pregnant mice and oxytocin did not augment
contractile activity, probably because OXTR mRNA
expression was low. By contrast, Arrowsmith et al. (2012)
have reported a striking reduction in spontaneous contra-
ctile force in non-pregnant human myometrium from
older women (post 30 years old) compared to myo-
metrium from non-pregnant 25–29-year-old women.
Returning to molecular events, despite evidence to
supporttheroleofPTGS2inhumanandmousepregnancy
(Reeseetal.1999;Slateretal.1999;Grossetal.2000;Tsuboi
et al. 2000; Tsuboi et al. 2003), the expression of PTGS2
was not induced in term myometrium or regulated by age.
This might be because we assessed the myometrium on
the day before delivery for the younger mice and 2 days
before in the 8-month-old old group. Tsuboi et al. (2000)
reported an absence of PTGS2 mRNA upregulation in
the myometrium of wild-type mice on the day before
parturition but strong signals for PTGS2 mRNA on the
day of parturition. Because myometrial tissues were taken
on day 18 of gestation, it would be beneficial to repeat
the present study using myometrial tissues collected on
day 19 of gestation in older primiparous mice, as well
as on the day of parturition for both young and older
mice.
The impact of mouse maternal age on uterine
mitochondrial number and function
The unique set of experiments that we undertook to
assess mitochondrial number and activity in the myo-
metrium from primiparous mice in the early stages of
reproductive ageing showed a clear reduction in the Mt/N
DNA copy number seen with age in myometrial tissues
from pregnant and non-pregnant animals. Interestingly,
there was a pregnancy-associated enhancement in the
Mt/N in younger mice, although this was suppressed in
older mice. By contrast, mean activities of mitochondrial
electron transport chain enzymes NADH dehydrogenase
and ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase (complexes I and
III), as well as citrate synthase activity, in the mouse myo-
metrium were not influenced by age or pregnancy state.
Succinate dehydrogenase (complex II) activity was also
unaffected by age but was enhanced in pregnancy.
These data differ from the bulk of published data
for cardiac and skeletal muscles and, to some extent,
smooth muscle, where the process of ageing has often been
associated with an alteration in the enzymatic activities of
all or some of the mitochondrial electron transport chain
complexes (Yen et al. 1989; Cooper et al. 1992; Torii et al.
1992; Sugiyama et al. 1993; Takasawa et al. 1993; Ojaimi
et al. 1999; Kwong & Sohal, 2000; Linet al. 2000; Short et al.
2005;Figueiredo etal.2008;Muller etal.2010;Padraoetal.
2012). Some contradictory data do exist, with alterations
in mitochondrial respiratory complex activities not always
being apparent across all tissues in aged animals (Kwong
and Sohal, 2000).
The reasons for minimal age-related changes in the pre-
sent study may relate to the age of mice used because the
majority of published studies have reported alterations in
mitochondrial electron transport chain complex enzyme
activities in muscles from animals far older than 8 months
of age.
Irrespective of age, complex II was found to be
significantly increased in the pregnant myometrium. This
novel finding could be explained, in part, by an increased
cell number and/or hypertrophy in the pregnant uterus
(Douglas et al. 1988; Shynlova et al. 2006). However, we
would also expect to see an increase in activities of all
other electron transport complexes, which was not the
case. Increased complex II activity is often associated
with increased rates of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production by reverse electron flux from complex II to
complex I (Quinlan et al. 2012; Dedkova et al. 2013).
Increased ROS production leads to an eventual reduction
of oxidative capacities and the ATP synthesis rate, which
may be why the activities of complex I and III were
not increased during pregnancy. To definitively determine
mitochondrial function in terms of oxidative capacity and
ATPproduction,NADHavailability(NADH/NAD+ ratio)
in the mitochondrial matrix should be measured.

The
impact
of
pregnancy
on
cytochrome
c
oxidase/complex IV activity has been reported previously
to increase in pregnant human and rat myometrium
(Geyer & Riebschl¨
ager, 1974) compared to non-pregnant
myometrium, but the ages of women were not reported
and the pregnant rats were only 40 days old.
The generalized age-related reduction in mt/N DNA
copy number in non-pregnant and pregnant myometrium
at 8 months of age suggests that this reduction pre-
cedes any change in mitochondrial complex activity. A
reduced mitochondrial copy number has been reported
previously as a consequence of ageing in rodent and
human skeletal muscle (Barazzoni et al. 2000; Short
et al. 2005; Peterson et al. 2012). According to the
mitochondrial theory of ageing, a decline in mtDNA
is a direct result of mitochondrial ROS accumulation,
which in turn causes progressive damage to mtDNA and
other mitochondrial constituents. The limited increase in
mitochondrial copy number in pregnant older animals
compared to non-pregnant animals probably has physio-
logical consequences in parturition and could help
explain the reduction in contractile potential in the
myometrium from older mice. A reduction in Mt/N
could reflect a concurrent reduction in capacity with
respect to generating sufficient cellular energy (ATP) to
drive uterine contractions but, because several copies of
mtDNA can be present in one mitochondria (Wiesner
et al. 1992), ATP production in mitochondria from
older animals would have to be measured to confirm
this.
The role of mitochondria and ATP provision in the
control of uterine contractions has been studied pre-
viouslyinthemousenon-pregnantmyometrium(Gravina
et al. 2010). Pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial
complex I and disruption of the mitochondrial membrane
potential caused a reduction in the force of myo-
metrial contractions in vitro. It was hypothesized that
these reductions were not linked to ATP generation
but suggested instead that mitochondrial Ca2+ handling
has an independent role in determining uterine contra-
ctility (Chalmers & McCarron, 2008; Gravina et al. 2010;
Gravina et al. 2011). This could comprise an alternative
explanation (given the reduction in mtDNA copy
number) for our observations showing that myometrium
from older pregnant mice has altered contractility
in vitro.
Summary
The present study confirms that both gestation and
parturition are prolonged in a primiparous mouse model
of maternal ageing, and there also is deterioration in
reproductive capacity as reflected by a decline in litter size.
The mouse model mimics the characteristics associated
with ageing in humans, including a delayed onset of
parturition and a prolonged duration of labour, as well as
a greater risk of fetal loss. It therefore comprises a suitable
model for assessing further the mechanisms responsible
for the age-induced changes demonstrated in the present
study.
The present study demonstrates that maternal age
influences the expression of contractile associated proteins
and also that alterations in spontaneous and oxytocin
augmented myometrial contractions in older mice. These
data suggest that myometrium from older mice on day
18 of gestation may not be fully ‘activated’ for parturition
mediated either by the limited progesterone withdrawal in
the older mice or a reduced uterine stretch as a result
of litter size. A reduced Mt/N copy number in myo-
metrialtissuesfromolderpregnantmiceimpliesthatmyo-
metrium in older mice have fewer mitochondria, with a
potential impact on myometrial contractile function in
these animals.
Taken together, the data from the present study
highlight the physiological and cellular changes that occur
with reproductive ageing. The reproductive tissue that is
predominantly affected by ageing is the myometrium.
Our work highlights the need for additional research
into this nascent area in both animal models and human
tissues, with the aim of developing a more detailed under-
standing of the mechanistic impact of maternal ageing
on labour. This is necessary to the inform management
of labour in older women, which is a burgeoning clinical
problem.
