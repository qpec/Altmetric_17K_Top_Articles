Abstract
Background and objectives Serum creatinine (SCr)–based AKI definitions have important limitations, particu-
larly in very low-birth-weight (VLBW) neonates. Urine biomarkers may improve our ability to detect kidney
damage. We assessed the association between 14 different urine biomarkers and AKI in VLBW infants.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements We performed a prospective cohort study on 113 VLBW infants
(weight #1200 g or ,31 weeks’ gestation) admitted to a regional neonatal intensive care unit at the University of
Alabama at Birmingham between February 2012 and June 2013. SCr was measured on postnatal days 1, 2, 3, and 4
and was combined with clinically measured SCr to determine AKI according to Kidney Disease Improving
Global Outcomes AKI definition (increase in SCr $0.3 mg/dl or $50% increase from previous lowest value).
Urine was collected on the first 4 days (average number of urine collections, 3; range, 1–4). The maximum urine
biomarkers and urine biomarker/creatinine levels were calculated for 12 urine biomarkers, and the minimum
urine biomarker and biomarker/creatinine levels were assessed for two urine biomarkers. We compared these
values between infants with and those without AKI. Ideal cutoffs, area under the receiver-operating characteristic
curve , and area under the curve adjusted for gestational age were calculated.
Results Cumulative incidence of AKI during the first 2 postnatal weeks was 28 of 113 (25%). Infants with AKI had
higher maximum levels of urine cystatin C, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, osteopontin, clusterin, and
a glutathione S-transferase (2.0, 1.8, 1.7, 1.7, and 3.7 times higher, respectively) than infants without AKI. In
addition, infants with AKI had lower minimum levels of epithelial growth factor and uromodulin than those
without AKI (1.4 and 1.6 times lower, respectively). Most but not all participants had their maximum (or minimum)
biomarker values preceding AKI. These associations remained after adjustment for gestational age.
Conclusions Urine biomarkers measured in the first 4 days of life are associated with AKI during the first
postnatal weeks. Further evaluations are necessary to determine whether these biomarkers can predict important
clinical outcomes. In addition, intervention studies that use biomarkers to stratify enrollment groups are needed
before bedside evaluations can be incorporated into care.

Introduction
AKI in premature infants is common and predicts
poor clinical outcomes (1). Current identification of
AKI relies on acute elevation of serum creatinine
(SCr), but SCr-based definitions are hampered by
numerous problems: most important, that SCr is a
measure of function, not damage (2). In neonates,
SCr-based AKI definitions present additional chal-
lenges because SCr levels on postnatal day 1 reflect
maternal SCr, which declines over the next week or
weeks depending on gestational age (GA) (3). In ad-
dition, acute changes in fluid status, which occur dur-
ing this time period, may have an important effect on
SCr values (4,5). Fortunately, urine protein bio-
markers show promise of someday being able to
help diagnose AKI early in the disease process by
noninvasively measuring specific urine proteins (6).
Improving the ability to reliably detect AKI would
have important implications in the ability to care for
critically ill neonates and will also improve the ability
to perform clinical research.
In evaluation of urine biomarkers of AKI in neo-
nates, it is critical to adjust for differences in GA.
Prior literature has shown that in premature infants
without AKI, urine proteins will be highest among
those with the lowest GA, probably because of the
passive loss of proteins in the context of immature
tubular function (6–8). Previously, we (7) and others
(8–18) have published data on the ability of urine
biomarkers to predict AKI in neonates; however,
these studies are limited by the size of the cohort
or the use of nested case–control methods, with
most of these studies evaluating only one biomarker.
In addition, previous studies were subject to risk of
misclassification bias, given that many infants had
only a few SCr levels measured to determine AKI.
This study extends our understanding of urine AKI
biomarkers by prospectively collecting SCr data in

 the entire cohort and increasing the sample size of infants
with and without AKI.
To address the limitations of prior literature, as well as to
improve the understanding of urine kidney damage bio-
markers in premature infants, we performed a prospective
cohort analysis on 113 premature infants (birth
weight,1200 g and/or GA of #31 weeks). We tested the
hypothesis that 14 specific candidate urine biomarkers (and
urine biomarker/creatinine ratios) are associated with AKI
in premature infants after controlling for GA. We tested the
maximum value obtained in 12 biomarkers and the mini-
mum value in two biomarkers (uromodulin and epithelial
growth factor).
Materials and Methods
Study Population
Preterm infants (birth weight [BW]#1200 g and/or
GA#31 weeks) admitted to the regional neonatal intensive
care unit at the University of Alabama at Birmingham be-
tween February 2012 and June 2013 were prospectively
followed. Newborns were excluded if they had known
congenital kidney disease or if they did not survive be-
yond the first 48 hours of life. We followed enrolled infants
from the time of birth until 36 weeks postmenstrual age
(PMA) or hospital discharge, whichever occurred first, as
is commonly done to define mortality in premature infants.
The study was approved by the University of Alabama at
Birmingham Institutional Review Board, and informed pa-
rental consent was obtained. The clinical and research activ-
ities reported here are also consistent with the Principles of
the Declaration of Helsinki.
Definition of Outcomes
To ascertain whether a child developed AKI within the
first 2 weeks of life, we measured SCr at postnatal days 1, 2,
3, and 4, in addition to any clinically measured values from
the first 2 weeks of life. SCr was measured once in four of
113 (3.5%), twice in six of 113 (5.3%), three times in ten of
113 (8.8%), and at least four times in 93 of 113 (82%) of the
cohort during the 2 weeks of life (median, 5 [range, 1–14]
days). Neonatal AKI was defined using the Kidney Dis-
ease Improving Global Outcomes AKI definition, in which
stage 1 was defined as an increase of SCr $ 0.3 mg/dl or

 an increase in SCr by $50% within the first 7 days of life,
stage 2 was defined as a doubling of SCr, and stage 3 was
defined as tripling of SCr (19). We compared each SCr to
the lowest previous SCr value to date (this was done be-
cause the postnatal day 1 SCr is related to the mother’s SCr
value and decreases steadily over the first weeks of life)
(3). The four infants who had only one SCr value collected
were assumed to not have AKI. We did not include urine
output criteria because it is often difficult to measure urine
output in babies, and many premature infants with AKI
are nonoliguric because of poor tubular function.
Biomarker Analysis
Urine was collected daily during the first 4 days of life
using Cuddle Buns (Small Beginnings, Hesperia, CA)
diapers placed at the perineum. Samples during the first
4 days of life were collected as follows: all 4 days, 60 of 113
(53%); 3 days, 25 of 113 (32%); 2 days, 13 of 113 (12%);
1 day, five of 113 (4%). The moist part of the diaper was cut
out and placed in a syringe. Urine was squeezed into a
centrifuge tube using the syringe plunger and centrifuged
for 10 minutes. The supernatant was aliquoted and frozen
at 270°C until evaluation. Urine biomarker analysis was
performed on multiarray plates by electrochemilumines-
cence using the Sector Image 2400 (Meso Scale Discovery
[MSD], Gaithersburg, MD]. Albumin, b-2-microglobulin
(B2M), cystatin C, epithelial growth factor (EGF), neutro-
phil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), osteopontin
(OPN), and uromodulin (UMOD) were measured in urine
using MSD Human Kidney Injury Panel 5 Kit assay; a
glutathione S-transferase (a-GST), calbindin, clusterin,
kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), osteoactivin, trefoil fac-
tor 3, and vascular EGF (VEGF) were measured using
MSD Human Kidney Injury Panel 3 Kit Assay. Samples
for panel 5 were diluted 500-fold before they were added
to the plate. Samples for panel 3 were diluted 10-fold be-
fore they were added to the plate. Samples were added to
plates and prepared as stated in the manufacturer’s pro-
tocol and were analyzed on Sector Imager. All markers
detected in the samples were in the range of the standard
curve. The inter-run and intrarun percentages of coeffi-
cient of variance, as well as the variability of samples
and standards (between-runs and in-runs) were below
10% in all cases and below 5% in most sample/standard
comparisons.
Statistical Analyses
Infant and maternal demographic characteristics and
intervention characteristics were compared between in-
fants with and those without AKI using a chi-squared test
(Fisher exact test when expected cell frequencies were ,5)
for categorical variables; a t test or Mann–Whitney U test

 was used for normally distributed and non-normally dis-
tributed continuous variables, respectively. Univariate sta-
tistics were computed for each biomarker of interest, and
in a subsequent analysis, a Mann–Whitney U test was
used to compare absolute maximum biomarker levels
and urine creatinine–corrected biomarker levels (to ac-
count for concentration differences) between the AKI and
non-AKI groups. Sample data were transformed to their
natural logarithm (to account for non-normal distribution).
To determine the biomarker threshold level that is best
associated with AKI, discriminatory statistics (i.e., area
under a receiver-operating characteristic curve [AUC])
were calculated for each biomarker using logistic regres-
sion adjusted for GA because of evidence in prior litera-
ture of a correlation between biomarker levels and GA
(20). To determine the threshold, predicted probabilities
were computed for each biomarker, and the biomarker
threshold was defined as the threshold level in which the
summation of sensitivity and specificity was maximized.
P,0.05 was considered to indicate statistically significant
differences. SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC), was used for all statistical analyses.
Results
Bivariate Analysis
Informed consent was granted in 122 of 284 (43%) very
low birth weight (VLBW) infants eligible for the study. The
reasons for nonenrollment included lack of interest (n=76),
lack of availability (n=78), or transfer to another hospital
(n=8). During a 2-week period, nine patients did not have
urine collected. We report our findings on the 113 infants
whose parents consented for the study and had at least
one urine collected for biomarker analysis. Overall, BW,
GA, and 5-minute Apgar score did not differ between in-
fants enrolled and those not enrolled (Figure 1).
Among the 113 infants included in the study, 28 (25%)
were diagnosed with AKI (25 with stage 1, one with stage 2,
and two with stage 3). Thirteen infants died(11.5%).
Babies with AKI had shorter birth length (32.0 cm versus
35.5 cm; P=0.02), were less likely to be born from moth-
ers with pre-eclampsia (one of 28 [4%] versus 32 of 85
[38%]; P=0.001), and were more likely to have an umbil-
ical artery catheter (18 of 28 [64%] versus 29 of 85 [34%];
P=0.02) (Table 1).
Biomarker Levels Comparison
Table 2 shows the distribution of the levels of the 14
urine biomarkers assessed by percentile groups across all
days in all patients. The maximum biomarker levels dur-
ing the first 4 postnatal days for those with and those
without AKI are shown in Table 3. Biomarkers are ex-
pressed as pg/ml. Compared with infants without AKI,
those with AKI had 2.0 times higher median levels for
cystatin C (18.93105 versus 9.133105; P=0.01), 1.8 times
higher NGAL (6.233105 versus 3.493105; P=0.04), 1.7
times higher clusterin (4.253105 versus 2.453105;
P=0.05), 1.7 times higher OPN (10.43105 versus
6.143105; P=0.01), and 3.7 times higher a-GST (9.103102
versus 2.403102; P=0.004). On the other hand, compared
with infants without AKI, those with AKI had 1.4 times
lower median EGF (3.633103 versus 7.93103; P=0.05) and
1.6 times lower median UMOD (2.863105 versus 8.333105;
P=0.001) than those without AKI (Table 3).
The maximum biomarker/creatinine (Cr) levels during
the first 4 postnatal days for infants with and those without
AKI are shown in Table 4. These values are expressed as
pg/mg creatinine. Compared with those without AKI,
those with AKI had 1.7 times higher median albumin/Cr
(4.253108 versus 2.403108; P=0.01), 1.6 times higher me-
dian B2M/Cr (16.03107 versus 9.933107; P=0.01), 2.8
times higher median cystatin C/Cr (20.73106 versus
7.233106; P=0.002). 1.9 times higher median NGAL/Cr
(6.113106 versus 3.173106; P=0.003), 1.7 higher median
OPN/Cr (7.753106 versus 4.643106; P=0.003), 2.0 times
higher median clusterin/Cr (3.453106 versus 1.693106;

1.133104; P=0.03), and 4.6 times higher median a-GST/
Cr (10.33103 versus 2.213103; P,0.001). In addition, com-
pared with infants without AKI, those with AKI had 1.3
times lower UMOD/creatinine (7.83106 versus 6.03106;
P=0.02) (Table 4). Controlling for urine creatinine yielded
statistically significant differences in three additional bio-
markers (albumin, B2M, and VEGF), whereas differences
in EGF were no longer statistically significant.
Association of Biomarkers and AKI
Of the biomarkers that were significantly different be-
tween patients with and without AKI, all had fair dis-
criminative capability (Table 5). In particular, UMOD had
the highest AUC (AUC, 0.71), followed by a-GST (AUC,
0.68) and EGF (AUC, 0.68). The biomarkers with the low-
est discriminative ability were clusterin (AUC, 0.62) and
albumin (AUC, 0.62). Combined with GA in the logistic
model, UMOD remained the biomarker with the highest
discriminative capability (AUC, 0.73), followed by EGF
(AUC, 0.70). The remaining biomarkers had similar
AUCs. After correcting for urine creatinine and combined
with GA, similar AUCs were observed, although cystatin
C had a slightly better discriminative capability (AUC,
0.70) (Table 6).
Timing of Occurrence of Maximum/Minimum Biomarker
Levels
AKI diagnosis occurred at a median age of 4 days (range,
2–5; mean, 3.4; SD, 1.1). Maximum biomarker values (or
minimum for UMOD and EGF) occurred before the di-
agnosis of AKI by SCr criteria in 44%–66% of infants for
any given biomarker (Table 7). This percentage was even
higher (78%–85% for any given biomarker) when the
timing of biomarker maximum/minimum on the day
of AKI diagnosis or the day before diagnosis was eval-
uated (Table 7).
Discussion
The maximum values of urine biomarkers in the first 4
postnatal days of life were 1.7–3.7 times higher in infants
with AKI than those without AKI for cystatin C, NGAL,
OPN, clusterin, and a-GST. The minimum EGF and
UMOD values were 1.4–1.6 times lower in those with
AKI compared with those without AKI. Furthermore, after
adjustment for urine creatinine, additional differences
were detected for B2M and VEGF, whereas EGF was no
longer significantly different. Overall there were moderate
performance profiles (with AUC of approximately 0.65–
0.7) for most of the biomarkers. These findings enhance
our understanding of the potential role of novel urine
AKI biomarkers in premature infants.
We have previously reported that urine NGAL, OPN,
cystatin C, and B2M levels were higher in those with AKI
than those without AKI (7). This study confirms those
findings in a larger cohort and, together with our previous
findings, provide insights into how AKI affects urine bio-
marker levels in this population. There were some discrep-
ancies in study design between the present study and our
previous published work (7), which may yield differing
results. Our previous study had a significantly smaller
sample size, with only nine AKI participants in the analy-
sis. In addition, the present study captured more SCr val-
ues, minimizing the possibility of misclassification bias.
Also, this study evaluated AKI only during the first weeks
of life.
Other previous studies that explored the role of AKI
biomarkers have suggested that urine biomarkers may be
useful candidate biomarkers in premature infants (8–18,21).

Urine Biomarkers of AKI in Premature Infants, Askenazi et al.
1531
 For example, Sarafidis et al. (10) showed that urine NGAL
levels on day 0 of life were higher in those who develop AKI
(n=9) by SCr criteira compared with GA-matched controls.
Similarly, Tabel et al. (11) showed that urine NGAL levels
were independently associated with AKI (n= 6) after adjust-
ment for GA, birthweight, sex, and 1-minute Apgar scores.
Others have also suggested that urine KIM-1 can be an
early marker of AKI in premature infants (8–12). For rea-
sons that are not entirely clear, urine KIM-1 was not sig-
nificantly associated with elevation of SCr. This could be
due to differences in tubular development in premature
infants, or the reasons for elevation of SCr could have
been different in our cohort compared with others.
When exploring the timing of changes in biomarkers in
relation to AKI, we found that most infants had maximum/
minimum biomarkers values before the diagnosis of AKI.
There are several possible explanations of why not all
infants had their highest (or lowest) biomarkers before AKI
diagnosis. First, it’s possible that the biomarkers continue
to rise (or drop) even after a SCr-based diagnosis is made.
Second, the limitations of SCr-based AKI definitions
(which functioned as our gold standard for AKI in this
study) may be causing this effect.
The baseline urine biomarkers of this cohort overall are
much higher than the biomarkers in other cohorts. This is
likely due to poor tubular function in premature infants.
We have previously shown that in infants without AKI,
these biomarkers vary by GA. Therefore, this variation
needs to be accounted for (as we did in the present study by
adjusting for GA in our analysis) in order to make proper
inferences.
Interestingly, we found that urine albumin, B2M, and
VEGF were not statistically significant when we looked at
the biomarkers alone, but they became statistically signif-
icantly different when we controlled for urine creatinine.
The main reason to control for urine creatinine is to adjust
for differences in the dilution of the samples. If two infants
had similar amount of biomarker excretion, but one infant
produced twice the urine volume of the other, the first
infant’s “diluted” urine would make it appear that the
amount of biomarker excreted was lower compared with
that of the second infant. Controlling for urine concentra-
tion allows the investigator to evaluate the biomarker
amount more accurately by controlling for dilution of the
sample. Alternatively, urine creatinine may differ almost

 two-fold in premature infants weighting 500 g versus
those weighing 1000 g as a direct proportion to muscle
mass. Overall, AUC improved slightly for both the crude
and adjusted analyses after adjustment for urine creati-
nine. Additional studies in larger cohorts are needed to
better understand these relationships and determine
whether correction for dilution status with creatinine (or
perhaps other markers) may help optimize these candidate
biomarkers. Moreover, it is possible that controlling with
other markers (which could help determine developmental
stage) could be also useful.
We have previously reported a protective association
between AKI and pre-eclampsia in premature infants (22),
and here we show again this important association. There
are several possible reasons for this association. It is pos-
sible that pre-eclampsia could alter the physiology of the
premature kidney in such manner that reduces its suscep-
tibility to develop AKI. For example, pre-eclampsia could
cause sequential or continuous episodes of ischemia pre-
conditioning, which helps protect against AKI in some hu-
man studies (23). Alternatively, the indication for the
delivery of a premature infant may differ between those
whose mothers had pre-eclampsia and those who are de-
livered because of other health issues, such as perinatal
infection.
The strengths of our study include the relatively large
number of infants with AKI (in comparison to other studies
of urine biomarkers in premature infants), as well as the
fact that each screened infant had ample SCr measurements
to determine AKI status. In addition, we have assessed a
broad number of candidate urine biomarkers for AKI.
Despite these strengths, we also acknowledge several
important limitations, which could provide insights as to
why the urine biomarker values were not more robust (with
AUC consistently around 0.65–0.7). The main potential
limitation of this study is that it relies on a rise in SCr
to define AKI as a gold standard definition for AKI. We
have used the most updated neonatal AKI definition, but
it has not been validated against hard clinical endpoints.
Thus, it is possible that we have identified as AKI some
cases with changes in SCr that may not be due to true
renal injury. In addition, it is very possible that the SCr in
many infants rises (i.e., functional change) without

 producing true damage. This is true for any population,
and perhaps even truer in this cohort, as the changes in
SCr during the first week of life can occur for various rea-
sons besides true kidney injury. Abrupt changes in fluid
status (premature infants can lose 15% of their weight in
the first week of life) may be causing changes in SCr, with-
out real kidney injury. Finally, we assumed that the four
infants with only one SCr measurement did not have AKI.
Future larger cohort studies are needed to solve some
of the limitations of our study. Although we adjusted for
gestational age, we acknowledge that we were unable to
control for all contributing factors that could be associated
with both AKI and biomarker values. In addition, the
sample size does not allow us to closely evaluate how the
trends in the biomarkers may differ in those with true
damage versus controls. Although maximum biomarker
levels appeared on (or before) the day of AKI diagnosis in
our study, future studies are needed to assess the rise/
reduction of these biomarkers in the context of confirmed
tubular injury.
Future studies with larger cohorts are underway and
may close the critical gaps in our understanding of the use
of urine biomarkers in premature infants. First, before we
can incorporate urine biomarkers into clinical practice, the
scientific community needs to show that candidate bio-
markers predict significant clinical outcomes, including the
development of CKD. Because only 13 infants in our cohort
died, we were underpowered to evaluate this association.
Second, future studies must also show that interventions
guided by urine biomarkers can affect clinical outcomes.
Third, studies that include only infants who are at high risk
for AKI (as opposed to testing all infants) will likely
improve the precision of these tests. Finally, studies to
identify the cause of the rise in SCr (i.e., patients who
have a transient versus sustained rise) are also needed.
Such studies could help to shed light on the challenging
task of identifying infants at risk of AKI and will have
critical importance in early diagnosis, which can drive
clinical change and test interventions in this vulnerable
population.
In conclusion, we expanded our understanding of the
normative values and changes in biomarker levels between
infants with and those without AKI, using the current
neonatal AKI definition. Larger well designed studies that
can stratify patients at risk, determine the cause of rising
SCr, and evaluate clinical outcomes (including CKD) are
needed to help validate the use of urine biomarkers in
clinical care.
