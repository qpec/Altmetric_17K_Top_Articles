ABSTRACT
The current methods available to diagnose antimicrobial-resistant Myco-
bacterium tuberculosis infections require a positive culture or only test a limited
number of resistance-associated mutations. A rapid accurate identification of antimi-
crobial resistance enables the prompt initiation of effective treatment. Here, we de-
termine the utility of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of M. tuberculosis directly
from routinely obtained diagnostic sputum samples to provide a comprehensive re-
sistance profile compared to that from mycobacterial growth indicator tube (MGIT)
WGS. We sequenced M. tuberculosis from 43 sputum samples by targeted DNA en-
richment using the Agilent SureSelectXT kit, and 43 MGIT positive samples from
each participant. Thirty two (74%) sputum samples and 43 (100%) MGIT samples
generated whole genomes. The times to antimicrobial resistance profiles and con-
cordance were compared with Xpert MTB/RIF and phenotypic resistance testing
from cultures of the same samples. Antibiotic susceptibility could be predicted from
WGS of sputum within 5 days of sample receipt and up to 24 days earlier than WGS
from MGIT culture and up to 31 days earlier than phenotypic testing. Direct sputum
results could be reduced to 3 days with faster hybridization and if only regions en-
coding drug resistance are sequenced. We show that direct sputum sequencing has
the potential to provide comprehensive resistance detection significantly faster than
MGIT whole-genome sequencing or phenotypic testing of resistance from cultures in
a clinical setting. This improved turnaround time enables prompt appropriate treat-
ment with associated patient and health service benefits. Improvements in sample
preparation are necessary to ensure comparable sensitivities and complete resis-
tance profile predictions in all cases.

T
uberculosis (TB) infection is a global emergency associated with an increasing
burden of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex infections (1). Phe-
notypic testing for antimicrobial resistance detection is slow, with results typically a
month to 6 weeks after initial culture confirmation, leading to the potential for
prolonged suboptimal antibiotic treatment. Molecular assays such as the Xpert MTB/RIF
(Cepheid), MTBDRplus, and MTBDRsl (Hain Lifescience) can rapidly detect a limited
number of first- and second-line drug resistance mutations (2). However, none are
currently able to identify the full range of antibiotic resistance mutations needed for
appropriately targeted therapy in people with multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB. Further,
these assays recognize only a fixed number of target mutations, missing less common
resistance mutations (3), while Xpert MTB/RIF can only detect DNA mutations and
cannot predict amino acid changes, resulting in potential false positives (4).
Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of M. tuberculosis enables a comprehensive
identification of all known drug-resistant mutations for all classes of TB drugs and also
can provide valuable contact tracing information (5). Recently, the sequencing of
organisms cultured in mycobacterial growth indicator tubes (MGITs) has been shown to
be both an accurate method for detecting first- and second-line resistance mutations
across the genome and less expensive than present routine diagnostic workflows (6).
Although it is being rolled out in England (7), it relies on bacterial culture, which can
delay the time to result by several weeks.
We previously described a successful method for capturing M. tuberculosis DNA
directly from sputum samples using biotinylated RNA baits (8). This protocol provides
a possible faster alternative to sequencing M. tuberculosis whole genomes and could
therefore offer a quicker diagnosis of antibiotic resistance, leading to tailored treatment
regimens with less use of antimicrobials and associated toxicity, fewer days in the
hospital, reduced cost, and improved outcomes.
Mixed-strain infections of M. tuberculosis are well documented (9) and may lead to
poor treatment outcomes and the possible emergence of minority drug-resistant
strains (10–12). Culture of M. tuberculosis is known to impact negatively the detection
of mixtures and minority variant mutations (13), with short-term MGIT culture being
particularly poor at identifying mixed infections (14).
The aims of this study were (i) to compare the utility of performing WGS directly
from routinely obtained diagnostic sputum with that from MGIT samples taken from
the same participant (time to diagnosis plus their ability to predict antimicrobial
resistance [AMR]) and (ii) to identify mixed infections and minority populations within
samples.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study recruitment. Individuals aged 16 years or older attending a TB service with suspected
pulmonary TB at seven clinics in London, UK, were invited to take part in this study.
DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from 1-ml clinical samples and MGIT cultures using mechanical
ribolysis and an automated DNA extraction workflow. Samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 16,200 �
g, and the supernatant was discarded. For MGIT cultures only, a saline prewash method was utilized to
reduce the human nucleic acid component of the sample (15). One milliliter of sterile saline was added
to the pellet (0.9% [wt/vol]), and the pellet was resuspended and centrifuged for 15 min at maximal
speed (16,200 � g). The supernatant was discarded and the process was repeated. For sputum and MGIT
cultures, approximately 50 �l of glass beads (425 to 600 �m) was added to each sample pellet, and
ribolysis was performed on a FastPrep24 platform for 45 s at 6.4 m/s. Two hundred forty microliters of
extraction buffer 2 and 10 �l of proteinase K were added to each of the samples, which were vortexed
and then incubated at 56°
C for 10 min. DNA was extracted from samples lysates on the Diasorin IXT
(Arrow) automated platform using DNA extraction cartridges eluting into 100 �l.
Quantification of extracted Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA. The Xpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid) assay
was performed on sputum samples as per the manufacturer’
s instructions; the M. tuberculosis quantity
was reported as either very low, low, medium, or high alongside threshold cycle (CT) values. The Xpert
MTB/RIF assay also reported rifampin resistance as “detected” or “not detected.” Drug susceptibility
testing was based on phenotypic cultures for first-line drugs on solid media using the resistance ratio

 method and was carried out by the National Mycobacterium Reference Service using their standard
protocols. A second M. tuberculosis-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting the 16S rRNA gene (rrs) was
utilized to quantify the M. tuberculosis DNA extracted from sputum samples and MGIT cultures. For MGIT
culture extracts, a 1/1,000 dilution was prepared prior to qPCR analysis. qPCR was performed using
forward primer 5=-GTGATCTGCCCTGCACCTC-3= and reverse primer 5=-ATCCCACACCGCTAAAGCG-3= with
a TaqMan probe ROX-AGGACCACGGGATGCATGTCTTGT-BHQ2 (16). The M. tuberculosis-specific qPCR
mixtures consisted of 12.5 �l of Quantitect Multiplex NoROX mix (Qiagen), 0.2 �M primers and probes,
and 5 �l template per reaction mixture in a total volume of 25 �l. Reactions were performed in duplicates
on a Rotor-gene 8000 platform. The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 50°
C for 30 min, 95°
C for 15
min, and 40 cycles of 94°
C for 45 s and 60°
C for 45 s. Standards were prepared from commercially sourced
M. tuberculosis genomic DNA (Vircell), reconstituted as directed by the manufacturer.
Sequencing library preparation and whole-genome sequencing. Total DNA was quantified in
sputum and MGIT extracts using the Qubit high sensitivity DNA assay (Life Technologies). Carrier human
genomic DNA (Promega) was added where needed to obtain a total of 200 ng of DNA input for library
preparation. All DNA samples were sheared using a Covaris S2 ultrasonicator for 150 s (peak incident
power [PIP], 175; duty factor, 5; 200 cycles per burst using frequency sweeping). Sputum samples were
prepared using the SureSelectXT target enrichment system for the Illumina paired-end sequencing
library protocol (Agilent Technologies). End repair, the 3= addition of adenosine, and the ligation of
adapters were all carried out according to Agilent’
s protocol. Prior to hybridization, 12 cycles of
precapture PCR were performed using primers provided in the SureSelectXT kit. Hybridization of M.
tuberculosis DNA to the streptavidin-coated beads was carried out using am M. tuberculosis-specific bait
set described previously (8). Briefly, 120-mer RNA baits were designed to provide nonredundant
coverage of the entire length of the positive strand of the H37Rv reference genome; they were
synthesized by Agilent Biotechnologies. The baits can be purchased from Agilent and the bait sequences
are available upon request from the authors. Eighteen cycles of postcapture PCR were performed with
indexing primers provided in the SureSelectXT kit. All Agilent-recommended quality control steps were
carried out. To compare the effect of target enrichment on MGIT sequencing, the first 14 MGIT samples
underwent library preparation using SureSelectXT, and all subsequent MGIT samples had DNA libraries
prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep kit (NEB) as per the manufacturer’
s protocol. The
resulting DNA libraries were run on either a MiSeq or NextSeq sequencer (Illumina) using either a V2
500-cycle or 500/550 Mid output 300-cycle kit, respectively.
Optimized sequencing method. Three samples were prepared using a SureSelectXT fast target
enrichment system (Agilent Technologies) as per the manufacturer’
s protocol. A reduced bait set was
designed to capture only genes associated with drug resistance, and information for spoligotyping was
used in the hybridization step. The reduced set of 120-mer RNA baits was synthesized by Agilent
Technologies in the same way as the full set, except that it only included baits that were complementary
to the genes and regions in Table 1 of the H37Rv reference genome.
Bioinformatics analysis. Sequencing reads weretrimmed for adapter content and quality using Trim
Galore, keeping reads longer than 100 bp. Trimmed reads were deduplicated and mapped to the H37Rv
(accession number NC_000962) reference genome using BBmap, allowing only successfully mapped
paired reads at the 99% equivalent minimum identity across the entire read and a maximum insert size
of 500 bp. Duplicate mapped reads were removed using Picard tools, and variants against the reference
genome were called with freebayes, keeping only variants with a minimum of 10 supporting reads,
greater than 2% frequency, mapping quality greater than 20, and a base quality score greater than 30,
with reads present on both the forward and reverse strands and on both the 5= and 3= ends of reads.
Variants found in and within 100 bp of Pro-Glu (PE) and Pro-Pro-Glu (PPE) genes, mobile elements, and
repeat regions were discarded. For resistance calling, single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were annotated

 using ANNOVAR (17). A maximum likelihood phylogeny was also inferred from 1,113 core genome SNVs
present in 64 samples representing 32 participants using RAxML (v. 8.2.1) (18) with 99 bootstrap
replicates. The SNV distance between pairs was calculated using R package seqinr. The same filtering
conditions were also applied to the variants for the minor variant analysis. The number of reads across
each variant position was normalized between pairs of samples from the same patient to adjust for the
effect of read depth on variant frequency. Minor variants were filtered from the data set if found on reads
with greater sequence identity to a different M. tuberculosis complex species. To further control possible
contamination of paired samples with low frequency variants, MGIT and sputum samples from each pair
were extracted on separate days, prepared in separate sequencing libraries, and sequenced on different
runs.
Ethics approval and consent to participate. Samples were collected with informed consent from
patients attending a TB clinic setting at the participating hospitals. Approval for the study was granted
by the NRES Committee East Midlands–Nottingham 1 (REC reference 15/EM/0091). All samples were
pseudoanonymized and allocated unique identification numbers.
Data availability. All sequence data associated with this study have been deposited in the European
Nucleotide Archive under study accession number PRJEB21685.
RESULTS
Genomic coverage. Sixty-three participants were prospectively enrolled. Paired
sputum and MGIT samples were sequenced from 43 patients. This is due to 10
participants not having an MGIT sample collected for sequencing, another eight
samples being smear and Xpert MTB/RIF negative, and two where the volume of
sputum was insufficient for DNA extraction. Samples sequenced from MGIT cultures
had a higher reference genome coverage than those obtained directly from sputum
(Fig. 1), and this was correlated to the increased M. tuberculosis DNA available from the
former (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The enrichment of MGIT culture
samples using the M. tuberculosis probes also enhanced the quality and depth of the
sequences (Fig. S1).
We next evaluated whether bacterial load, as measured by smear and Xpert MTB/
RIF, could be used to predict the success of whole-genome sequencing. From 43
patients, 32 sputum samples (74.4%) and 43 MGIT samples (100%) generated whole
genomes (�85% coverage against reference genome) (Fig. 2A). Sputum sequencing
success was linked to estimated input pathogen copy number. We stratified partici-
pants into 16 with high (3� smear result, Xpert MTB/RIF high), 18 with medium (2�
smear result, Xpert MTB/RIF medium), and 9 with low (scanty or 1� smear result, Xpert
MTB/RIF low) bacterial loads and found that 87.5% of sputum samples with high
bacterial load samples generated complete genomes compared to 72.2% with medium
and 55.5% with low bacterial loads (Fig. 2B and C). We were also able to recover partial

 genomes for two sputum samples that were reported as negative by smear microscopy
but Xpert MTB/RIF positive.
MGIT and sputum sequence variation. A comparison of the 32 patients with both
complete sputum and MGIT genomes available showed no unique consensus sequence
variation between the pairs. The identity between sputum and MGIT consensus se-
quences is shown in a heat map (Fig. 3) and phylogenetic tree (see Fig. S2). Twenty-
three MGIT and sputum pairs showed no SNV between them at the consensus level,
while nine patients’sample pairs differed by one or two single nucleotides. In all nine
patients, the consensus polymorphism was present as a minority variant in the matched
sputum or MGIT sample (see Table S1).
Time to antibiotic resistance prediction. Allowing for sample batching, which was
only carried out for study purposes, the direct sequencing of sputum using targeted
enrichment reduced the time to antibiotic susceptibility prediction initially to 5 days,
compared with a mean of 11 (standard deviation [SD], 6) days for MGIT sequencing (Fig. 4).
This was reduced further by protocol optimization to 3 days when a reduced bait set was
used that captures only the regions with putative resistance mutations (Table 1 and Fig. 4).
Hybridization optimization also reduced the whole-genome protocol to 4 days (Fig. 4). The

fully resequenced three MDR-TB samples (noted in Fig. 4.) from this study to a high average
depth of coverage (�2,000�) over the captured regions. All eight genotypic resistant
variants identified in the whole-genome sequencing data were also identified after rese-
quencing with the reduced bait set (see Fig. S3). Overall, 36 sputum samples with complete
genomes, including 77% of those with drug resistance mutations, would have been
reported a mean of 9 days earlier than with MGIT sequencing and a mean of 35 days earlier
than with phenotypic testing using the optimized 3-day protocol.
Antibiotic resistance concordance. We found complete concordance between
resistance mutations identified in paired MGIT and sputum samples from nine partic-
ipants when there was �85% single read coverage against the reference genome. Four
participants missed resistance mutations where sputum sequencing read coverage was
too low to make a reliable call (Table 2). Xpert MTB/RIF, sputum WGS, and MGIT WGS
were concordant with phenotypic resistance testing in 21 of 23 resistance mutations
identified (Table 2). The exceptions were where a variant in participant RF015GT
predicting an amino acid change Ser428Iso in rpoB (H37Rv codon numbering; Esche-
richia coli rpoB numbering S509I) was reported as resistant by Xpert MTB/RIF, but the
reference laboratory found it to be susceptible (Table 2). Previous publications have
shown that not all SNVs at this position are associated with resistance (19–21). A fixed

mutation was found to be susceptible. This common polymorphism in katG has been
previously been shown to confer consistently high levels of isoniazid resistance to M.
tuberculosis (22–24). Whole-genome sequencing from both MGIT and sputum samples
also identified streptomycin (three patients) and p-aminosalicylic acid ([PAS] four
patients) resistance mutations, neither of which is routinely tested within the pheno-
typic assay in the United Kingdom.

 Mixed infections and minority variants. No mixed infections were detected. Using
data normalized for read depth, from 32 matched sputa-MGIT samples, minor fre-
quency variation was low, with only 88 minority biallelic sites meeting the quality
criteria identified in all samples, representing 0.002% unique variable positions across
the genomes. We undertook stringent procedures to exclude sequencing error, the
presence of closely related M. tuberculosis complex species in sputum, contamination in
and between sequencing runs, and lab contamination after sample collection as
potential causes for the findings. None of the variant alleles were at positions known to
be associated with antimicrobial resistance. In 41% (13) of cases, directly sequenced
sputa had higher numbers of novel minority variants identified than the matched MGIT
samples, compared to 19% (6) of MGIT samples with more minority variants in the
sputum samples (see Fig. S4).
To control for the potential influence of the SureSelectXT step, we analyzed the
proportions of minority variants shared between sputum and eight SureSelectXT
enriched MGIT samples (40%), comparing between sputum and 16 nonenriched sam-
ples (38%), and found no statistically significant difference (P � 0.854). Overall, 37.2%
of minority variants were concordant between sputum and MGIT samples, and the read
frequencies with which they occurred were weakly correlated (see Fig. S5). This
correlation was skewed by one patient (WH044IL), in whom both MGIT and sputum
samples were more variable than other samples (Fig. S4) and in whom seven variants
were at much higher frequencies in the MGIT than in sputum (at 30% to 45% versus
�5%, respectively) (Fig. S5 and S6). However, there was no evidence of mixed geno-
types. The five synonymous minor variants and two nonsynonymous variants occurring
in two genes of unknown function (Rv3529c and Rv3888c) were distributed across the
genome and were not shared across any other pairs of samples.
DISCUSSION
We have shown that using target enrichment WGS methodology directly from
diagnostic sputum samples generates resistance data, at most, up to 24 days earlier
than MGIT culture WGS and up to 31 days faster than phenotypic testing of Mycobac-
terium tuberculosis. Sputum sequencing only achieved whole-genome sequences suit-
able for predicting resistance mutations in 32/43 (74%) samples, though this included
a smear-negative sputum sample. Our demonstration that the quality of sequence data
is strongly correlated with the input level of TB DNA (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental
material) means that the success of sequencing can be predicted using semiquantita-

 tive methods such as smear microscopy and Xpert MTB/RIF (Fig. 2), notwithstanding
their variable performance (25).
Our data compare well with a recent report describing WGS of sputum where
contaminating human DNA had been depleted (26). While this method achieved a
slightly faster turnaround time on diagnostic samples (2 versus 5 days), it may be less
susceptible than targeted enrichment, as only 60% (24/40) of smear-positive samples
yielded sequence data suitable for resistance prediction. The study did not report
bacterial load, and so a thorough comparison of sensitivity cannot be performed. The
methods are, however, highly complementary, and combining the two would likely
improve the genome copy input and increase direct WGS sensitivity. Our experience
with enrichment methods (27, 28) also predicts that a redesign of the first-generation
probe set would further improve the detection of resistance mutations.
Direct sequencing of sputum is currently slower than rapid methods such as the Xpert
MTB/RIF and the Hain MTBDRplus and MTBDRsl assays for detecting resistance. However,
there are major advantages to using WGS. First, unlike existing rapid methods, it can
accurately identify the precise nucleotide change causing resistance. In our study, Xpert
MTB/RIF reported resistance in a susceptible organism where there was a nucleotide
change at position 428 in the rpoB gene not associated with resistance (19–21). Where
discordant resistance results were found between molecular methods and the routine
phenotypic testing, we could not repeat the phenotypic testing, as this was carried out
historically by a centralized reference laboratory. Therefore, these discrepancies cannot be
confirmed, and this represents a limitation of this type of study. Second, WGS, unlike rapid
methods which target specific mutations, is able to detect resistance mutations for a wider
range of second- and third-line drugs and also new drugs where current rapid tests would
require costly redesign. This has already helped us to personalize treatment in a case of
drug-resistant M. tuberculosis (29). Third, the data from direct WGS of sputum can report
evolutionary relationships between samples (Fig. S2), providing the most detailed informa-
tion on transmission dynamics available.
An important objective of our study was to evaluate the potential for direct
sequencing from sputum to detect mixed M. tuberculosis infections, which are subop-
timally identified by MGIT and solid culture (13, 14). Mixed infections are important in
the pathology of TB, and the ability to detect resistance variants that are not at a
consensus level, although not necessarily common (30), can affect antibiotic steward-
ship (31). Mixed infections and MDR-TB are more prevalent in countries with a much
higher burden of TB than the United Kingdom and a greater prevalence of drug
resistance, while high levels of HIV amplify the problem (32, 33). We were able to detect
significantly more minority single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in sputum compared to
the matched MGIT sequence (Fig. S5), despite the mostly clonal populations in this

 study and the greater read depths achieved from MGIT sequencing. The origin of this
heterogeneity remains unconfirmed, although we rigorously excluded contamination
and methodological error. SNVs could be due to the presence in sputum of nontuber-
culous mycobacteria and other species which are known to have sequence homology
with M. tuberculosis and may theoretically be detected by targeted enrichment. How-
ever, our use of highly stringent sequence mapping and the fact that the SNVs were
detected across the genome and not concentrated in regions generally associated with
cross hybridization suggest that they are real. In case WH044IL, seven SNVs present in
sputum increased in frequency in the MGIT culture, possibly reflecting a selective
growth advantage for this haplotype, particularly as one nonsynonymous SNV occurred
in the Rv3888c gene, which has been shown to be essential for mycobacterial in vitro
growth (34). This result confirms suggestions that diversity is lost and that culture-
related selection of some variants can occur even during limited MGIT culture. Thus,
MGIT culture may not be representative of the original sample and could potentially
reduce the likelihood of identifying low-level resistance mutations and mixed infections
that may act as a reservoir for resistance development.
The standard diagnostic workflows for M. tuberculosis are costly and time consum-
ing. Ground breaking work within Public Health England has demonstrated that
sequencing M. tuberculosis whole genomes from positive MGIT cultures is faster and
less expensive (6), and where the sputum pathogen DNA concentration is low, early
MGIT sequencing could still be the best possible workaround (15). Direct sequencing of
M. tuberculosis from sputum has the potential to reduce the time to antimicrobial
resistance detection within a clinically relevant time frame (26). We show here that its
success is critically dependent on the input genome copies of pathogen DNA. While
enrichment increases the cost of pathogen sequencing, this could be offset, as dem-
onstrated in our study, by only enriching areas of interest on the genome. It is
important to note that the infrastructure and expertise for rapid, high-throughput,
targeted enrichment sequencing directly from clinical material of M. tuberculosis and
other pathogens already exist in genomic centers where cancer and genetic disease
sequencing uses this methodology. We believe, therefore, that effective scale-up and
implementation of this rapid and accurate technology is relatively easy, once the
technique has been optimized.
