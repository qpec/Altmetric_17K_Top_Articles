Tau positron emission tomography ligands provide the novel possibility to image tau pathology in vivo. However, little is known about
how in vivo brain uptake of tau positron emission tomography ligands relates to tau aggregates observed post-mortem. We performed
tau positron emission tomography imaging with 18F-AV-1451 in three patients harbouring a p.R406W mutation in the MAPT gene,
encoding tau. This mutation results in 3- and 4-repeat tau aggregates similar to those in Alzheimer’s disease, and many of the mutation
carriers initially suffer from memory impairment and temporal lobe atrophy. Two patients with short disease duration and isolated
memory impairment exhibited 18F-AV-1451 uptake mainly in the hippocampus and adjacent temporal lobe regions, correlating with
glucose hypometabolism in corresponding regions. One patient died after 26 years of disease duration with dementia and behavioural
deficits. Pre-mortem, there was 18F-AV-1451 uptake in the temporal and frontal lobes, as well as in the basal ganglia, which strongly
correlated with the regional extent and amount of tau pathology in post-mortem brain sections. Amyloid-b (18F-flutemetamol) positron
emission tomography scans were negative in all cases, as were stainings of brain sections for amyloid. This provides strong evidence that
18F-AV-1451 positron emission tomography can be used to accurately quantify in vivo the regional distribution of hyperphosphorylated
tau protein.

 Introduction
Tau pathology is closely related to neuronal dysfunction
and degeneration in Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopa-
thies. In these disorders, tau is abnormally hyperpho-
sphorylated
and
accumulates
intracellularly,
forming
tangles of paired helical filaments (PHF), twisted ribbons
and/or straight filaments (Iqbal et al., 2016). Tau aggre-
gates
in Alzheimer’s
disease
consist predominantly
of
PHF, which contain all six isoforms of tau, mixed with
straight filaments. The recent development of PET radio-
tracers for tau aggregates opens up the possibility to assess
tau
pathology
in
vivo
(Ossenkoppele
et
al.,
2015;
Villemagne and Okamura, 2015; Harada et al., 2016;
Johnson et al., 2016; Scholl et al., 2016; Smith et al.,
2016). These tracers, along with PET tracers revealing
extracellular plaques containing amyloid-b fibrils, will be
essential for improving the early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s
disease in clinical practice as well as in the evaluation of
novel disease-modifying therapies (Dani et al., 2016).
Studies using the most common PET tracer for tau path-
ology
to
date,
18F-AV-1451,
demonstrated
increased
uptake
in
temporo-parietal
regions
in
patients
with
Alzheimer’s disease (Chien et al., 2013; Johnson et al.,
2016; Ossenkoppele et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2016). In
post-mortem brain tissue, this ligand was screened to
detect PHFs of tau, exhibiting a 425-fold higher affinity
for PHF-tau compared to amyloid-b fibrils (Xia et al.,
2013). Recently, an autoradiography study reported prefer-
ential
in
vitro
binding
of
18F-AV-1451
to
PHFs
in
Alzheimer’s disease, not to straight filaments resulting
from other tauopathies (Marquie et al., 2015). However,
no study has hitherto compared regional in vivo binding of
a tau PET tracer with the distribution and the degree of tau
pathology using post-mortem immunohistochemistry in the
same individual.
Individuals exhibiting only tau pathology, not amyloid-b
fibrils, are an ideal group to further explore the binding
properties of a tau PET tracer. The p.R406W mutation in
the gene encoding the tau protein (MAPT c.1216C4T;
R406W) on chromosome 17 results in neurofibrillary tan-
gles that are similar to the neurofibrillary tangles in
Alzheimer’s
disease
at
an
ultrastructural
level
(Ghetti
et al., 2015). Many cases with this mutation present with
slowly progressive episodic memory impairment, which in
many ways clinically resembles Alzheimer’s disease (Ostojic
et al., 2004; Passant et al., 2004). Previous neuropatho-
logical examination of R406W mutation carriers revealed
tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles and neurites. These
PHF-tau changes were mainly localized in temporal and
frontal lobe areas as well as the basal ganglia, sparing
the parietal and occipital lobes (Lindquist et al., 2008;
Ghetti et al., 2015).
Here we report the first results of 18F-AV-1451 (tau),
18F-flutemetamol (amyloid-b) and
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose
(FDG, glucose metabolism) PET imaging in three patients
carrying the MAPT R406W mutation at different disease
stages. In addition, we report results from the neuropatho-
logical examination of one of these subjects who died 2
weeks after the PET scans, as well as the relationship be-
tween in vivo and post-mortem assessment of tau path-
ology
in
this
case.
Finally,
autoradiography
using
3H-AV1451 was performed on cortical tissue sections
from two additional deceased patients with the MAPT
R406W mutation.
Materials and methods
Participants
Three subjects carrying the MAPT R406W mutation, aged 56,
60 and 76 years, (Patients A, B and C, respectively) from a
family with hereditary dementia from Southern Sweden were
investigated. Four control subjects and five patients with
Alzheimer’s disease were recruited from the ongoing Swedish
Biofinder Study (www.biofinder.se). Further information on
the clinical assessments is given in the Supplementary material.
All clinical data are summarized in Table 1. Written informed
consent was obtained from the participants, and approval of
this study was obtained from the Regional Ethical Review
Board in Lund, Sweden.
MRI and CT scan
Patients A and B underwent a 3 T MRI scan using a Siemens
Skyra scanner. T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gra-
dient echo (T1-MPRAGE) was acquired at a resolution of
1 � 1 � 1 mm. Patient C could not undergo MRI due to claus-
trophobia and consequently underwent a CT scan, using a
Philips Brilliance 64 scanner. Images were reconstructed to
5 mm axial and 3 mm coronal slices.
PET
18F-AV-1451 PET scans were performed on a GE Discovery
690 PET scanner (General Electric Medical Systems) as dy-
namic scans using LIST-mode 100–120 min after a bolus in-
jection of 365 � 14 MBq of
18F-AV-1451.
18F-FDG scans
were
acquired
on
the
same
scanner
in
a
static
scan
60–80 min after injection of 198 � 2 MBq of FDG. Images
of 18F-flutemetamol (Nelissen et al., 2009) were obtained as
dynamic scans 90–110 min after injection of 193 � 2 MBq on
a
Philips
Gemini
TF
PET-CT
scanner
(Philips
Medical
Systems). Low dose CT scans for attenuation correction were
performed immediately prior to the PET scans. PET data were
reconstructed into 5 min frames using an iterative Vue Point
HD algorithm with six subsets, 18 iterations with 3 mm filter
and no time-of-flight correction. 18F-flutemetamol data were
processed using NeuroMarQ software (GE Healthcare), ana-
lyses of 18F-AV-1451 and 18F-FDG data were performed using
PMOD 3.603 software (Pmod, Zurich, Switzerland). PET
images were co-registered to their corresponding magnetic res-
onance T1-MPRAGE or CT images. We chose to analyse the
18F-AV-1451 standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) from
the same areas that were processed for neuropathological ana-
lysis in Patient C, with the addition of a few areas in the
Tau PET in MAPT mutation carriers

 temporal and frontal lobes and the basal ganglia, areas known
to be affected by pathology in R406W mutation carriers.
Regions of interest were delineated manually for the data pre-
sented in Figs 1 and 3. Regions of interest were delineated on
the magnetic resonance images (Patients A and B, as well as
control subjects and cases with Alzheimer’s disease) or CT
image (Patient C) and transformed into PET space using trans-
formations derived from co-registrations. The cerebellar cortex
was used as a reference region for the calculation of SUVRs.
For the analysis of correlations between regional 18F-FDG
SUVRs and 18F-AV-1451 SUVRs in Patients A and B (Fig. 2),
the MRI was segmented into grey and white matter and re-
gions of interest were defined using FreeSurfer (version 5.3 and
its Desikan-Killiany Atlas). PET images were co-registered to
the MRIs and SUVRs calculated in PET space. The cerebellar
cortex was also here used as a reference region for the calcu-
lation of SUVRs. Further, the SUVRs of the 18F-FDG scans
were normalized to the mean control 18F-FDG value for each
neocortical region in order to relate the tau pathology to the
relative change of the 18F-FDG uptake in Patients A and B,
respectively (Smith et al., 2016).
Neuropathology
Neuropathological diagnostic analysis was performed on sec-
tions including the hippocampus, the inferior and superior
temporal gyri, the frontal pole and the dorsolateral frontal
gyri, the parietal cortex, occipital cortex and cerebellum.
Details of immunohistochemical procedures are described in
the
Supplementary
material.
Neurodegenerative
structural
changes were assessed as to regional extent, local–regional se-
verity and to intensity/density of protein pathology, with
regard to tau appearance. Tau pathology in the cortical com-
partment was readily graded in none, mild, moderate, and
severe (grades 0, + , + + and + + + , respectively), for correl-
ation with 18F-AV-1451 uptake. Mild grade ( + ) corresponded
with few loosely knit aggregates of tau-positive fibres in one or
two cortical layers, mostly the laminae II–III, and a few dis-
persed tau-positive neurites between the aggregates. Moderate
grade ( + + ) signified scattered loosely knit fibre aggregates in
all layers, with tau-positive scattered neurites and occasional
tangle-filled neurons in-between. In severe grade ( + + + ),
abundant aggregates were seen in all layers, with numerous
tau-positive neurites and several tau-positive tangle-filled neu-
rons in-between. Inter-rater reliability was determined by three
independent,
blinded
readers
(Cohen’s
kappa,
0.72–0.84;
P 5 0.001; SPSS version 22). As a second independent measure
of tau-positive neurite density, the number of neurites/mm was
estimated in the cortex of tau-stained sections using stereolo-
gical systematic random sampling (Ronn et al., 2000) (Stereo
Investigator, MBF Bioscience). Only cortical areas and the pu-
tamen could be reliably sampled using this stereological
approach.
Autoradiography
Details
of
the
methods
regarding
autoradiography
are
described in the Supplementary material.
Statistical analyses
Correlations between neurite density, the neuropathological
grade of tau pathology and
18F-AV-1451 SUVR values as
well as the correlation between
18F-FDG and
18F-AV-1451
SUVR were analysed with non-parametric Spearman’s Rank-
Order Correlation using Graph Pad Prism 6. A P-value
of 5 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Study subjects
The three examined patients belonged to two generations
of a family with slowly progressive dementia; all carried the
MAPT R406W mutation. Cognitive testing of Patients A
and B revealed an isolated memory impairment (Table 1),
and both fulfilled the criteria of mild cognitive impairment
(Petersen, 2004). Patient A had a 10-year history of isolated
short-term memory loss and irritability and Patient B had
developed mild memory impairment and increased anxiety

 4 years prior to the clinical examination. MRI in both cases
showed no or slight general brain atrophy with moderate
atrophy in the medial temporal lobes, most pronounced in
the parahippocampal gyri with widening of the collateral
sulci, and a medial temporal atrophy corresponded to
Scheltens score 1. Patient C exhibited memory impairment
26 years prior to this examination and had developed
marked dementia, behavioural disturbances, mutism, dys-
phagia and mild parkinsonism by the time of this study.
The CT scan showed generalized cortical atrophy with sub-
stantial atrophy of the medial temporal lobes, especially of
the parahippocampal gyri with pronounced widening of the
collateral sulci. Medial temporal atrophy corresponded to
Scheltens score 3.
18F-AV-1451 and 18F-flutemetamol
PET
In the two younger cases (Patients A and B; Fig. 1A, B and
I), retention of 18F-AV-1451 was most distinct in the tem-
poral poles, the hippocampus and anterior aspects of the
inferior temporal gyrus. Uptake was also detected in the
basal regions of the frontal lobes. In the more affected
case (Patient C, Fig. 1C and I), a more widespread reten-
tion pattern was observed in the temporal lobes, the basal
ganglia and the frontal lobes. No significant tracer uptake
was detected in the parietal or occipital lobes. Control cases
showed no tracer retention in cortical areas (Fig. 1D and
Supplementary Fig. 1).
The patients further underwent
18F-flutemetamol PET
scans. Composite scores representing mean global cortical
uptake were below a previously determined cut-off for
amyloid-b-positivity (51.42; Palmqvist et al., 2014) in
the three patients who did not show visual signs of cortical
18F-flutemetamol retention either (Fig. 1E–G).
Correlation of 18F-AV-1451
with 18F-FDG
Patients A and B underwent an additional 18F-FDG scan.
The 18F-FDG SUVRs for each region were normalized to
the controls’ regional SUVRs and correlated with the cor-
responding AV-1451 SUVRs (Fig. 2A–D). We found stat-
istically significant inverse relationships of higher regional
AV-1451
uptake
with
lower
FDG
retention
in
both
patients (Patient A: rs = �0.39, P 5 0.01, Fig. 2E; Patient
B: rs = �0.37, P 5 0.01, Fig. 2F).

Immunohistochemical staining for hyperphosphorylated tau
protein showed extensive neuronal tau pathology in the tem-
poro-limbic region, the anterior temporal lobe and hippocam-
pus, where tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles were abundant
along with tau-positive neurites. Lower-grade pathology was
detected in frontal cortical areas, whereas posterior cortical
areas were only affected to a minor degree. Tau pathology
was assessed according to a four-point grading system (0, +,
+ +, + + +), as described above, and results are summarized
in Fig. 3A–J. Both 3R and 4R tau-positive neurites could be
detected using isotype specific antibodies (data not shown).
No amyloid-b-containing neuritic plaques or amyloid angio-
pathy were detected (data not shown).

(r = 0.93,

positive neurites (r = 0.92, P 5 0.01; Fig. 3K). Interestingly,
the region with the highest SUVR (2.85) was putamen,
which did not exhibit higher tau pathology density than
the inferior temporal lobe with an SUVR of 2.38.
Autoradiography
Cortical tissue samples from two other patients with the
R406W MAPT mutation were analysed using autoradiog-
raphy. Specific binding of 3H-AV1451 to tau aggregates
could be detected in the cortical tissue sections of both
patients. Radioligand binding was co-localized with tau ag-
gregates, as visualized by immunohistochemistry with the
tau-specific antibody AT8 (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Discussion
In the present study we describe three members of a family
with MAPT R406W mutation at different stages of a
degenerative neurological disorder. In vivo imaging with
18F-AV-1451 PET indicated that tau pathology in these
cases starts in the inferior temporal lobes and temporal
poles, and at a later stage also involves the basal ganglia
and the frontal cortex while sparing posterior cortical areas

 and the cerebellum. In one patient who died shortly after
PET scanning and was examined neuropathologically, we
found a strong positive correlation between the regional
in vivo retention of 18F-AV-1451 and the density of tau
aggregates visualized with immunohistochemistry in post-
mortem brain tissue. Our study is the first to report
18F-AV-1451 PET signal being directly correlated to neuro-
pathological tau burden in the same individual, which pro-
vides strong evidence that in vivo
18F-AV-1451 PET
retention indeed reflects the density of tau pathology con-
sisting of PHFs. However, it is known that unspecific re-
tention of 18F-AV-1451 occurs in the striatum and choroid
plexus, for example (Scholl et al., 2016). It is therefore
interesting to note that the region with highest retention
of 18F-AV-1451 in Patient C was the putamen. The neuro-
pathological evaluation revealed relatively severe tau path-
ology in this region, but even greater pathological burden
was observed in the inferior temporal lobe, which exhibited
a slightly lower retention of 18F-AV-1451 (Fig. 3K), indi-
cating that a proportion of the signal in the putamen might
represent unspecific tracer retention in addition to the spe-
cific binding to tau aggregates.
The R406W mutation is located in the N-terminal exon
13 of the MAPT gene and causes the formation of agglom-
erations containing six isoforms of tau (including 3R and
4R
tau)
highly
similar
to
the
aggregates
found
in
Alzheimer’s disease (Hong et al., 1998; Ghetti et al.,
2015), which was corroborated in the present study.

 At an ultrastructural level the tau filaments are PHF and
straight filaments with a diameter of 8–20 nm, structurally
similar to filaments found in Alzheimer’s disease (Reed
et al., 1997; Hutton et al., 1998). It has previously been
shown that 18F-AV-1451 can detect tau aggregates in pa-
tients with Alzheimer’s disease (Ossenkoppele et al., 2015;
Johnson et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2016). Our study pro-
vides proof of concept that it is also possible to visualize
tau pathology in R406W tau mutation carriers using
18F-AV-1451 PET. This is in accordance with a recent
study reporting highly concordant patterns of staining
with tau-antibody AT8 and 18F-AV-1451 binding in post-
mortem brain tissue of among others, Alzheimer’s disease
patients and subjects carrying MAPT mutations (Sander
et al., 2016), although this study also found evidence for
off-target binding and lack of correlation between antibody
staining and in vitro tracer binding in certain tau strains.
However, the present study indicates that the in vivo bind-
ing of 18F-AV-1451 correlates highly with the extent of tau
aggregates containing PHF. With tau immunization thera-
pies for Alzheimer’s disease currently emerging (Pedersen
and Sigurdsson, 2015), tau mutation carriers constitute
the ideal population for studying the effects of these thera-
pies. Not only would it be possible to examine the effects
of anti-tau treatment in the absence of concurrent amyloid-
b pathology, but also to identify and recruit subjects to
clinical trials at a presymptomatic disease stage. Our results
also suggest that one study endpoint in such clinical trials
could be 18F-AV-1451 retention.
Furthermore, we found an inverse relationship between
the retention of 18F-AV-1451 and brain glucose metabolism
as measured by 18F-FDG, indicative of decreased neuronal
metabolism and dysfunction in areas affected by tau path-
ology. These results indicate that tau-pathology is tightly
associated with neuronal dysfunction, which is in line with
previous publications on tau and glucose hypometabolism
in Alzheimer’s disease (Ossenkoppele et al., 2015; Smith
et al., 2016). Similarly, cognitive testing in Patients A and
B only showed deficits restricted to memory, likely reflect-
ing the limited distribution of tau pathology and glucose
hypometabolism to the inferior and medial temporal lobes
in these two cases.
In conclusion, our results strongly support the notion
that in vivo
18F-AV-1451 PET reflects the intensity of
regional tau neuropathology. The level of
18F-AV-1451
retention correlates with glucose hypometabolism and neur-
onal dysfunction. Tau pathology in R406W mutation car-
riers can be visualized using
18F-AV-1451 PET, thus
providing a useful tool for monitoring the effects of
future therapies directed against the formation of tau-inclu-
sions in these patients.
