Abstract
Rationale: Hospital chaplains provide spiritual care that
helps patients facing serious illness cope with their symptoms
and prognosis, yet because mechanically ventilated patients
cannot speak, spiritual care of these patients has been limited.
Objectives: To determine the feasibility and measure the effects of
chaplain-ledpicture-guidedspiritualcareformechanicallyventilated
adults in the intensive care unit (ICU).
Methods: We conducted a quasi-experimental study at a tertiary
care hospital between March 2014 and July 2015. Fifty mechanically
ventilated adults in medical or surgical ICUs without delirium or
dementia received spiritual care by a hospital chaplain using an
illustrated communication card to assess their spiritual affiliations,
emotions, and needs and were followed until hospital discharge.
Feasibility was assessed as the proportion of participants able to
identify spiritual affiliations, emotions, and needs using the card.
Among the first 25 participants, we performed semistructured
interviews with 8 ICU survivors to identify how spiritual care helped
them. For the subsequent 25 participants, we measured anxiety (on
100-mm visual analog scales [VAS]) immediately before and after
the first chaplain visit, and we performed semistructured interviews
with 18 ICU survivors with added measurements of pain and stress
(on 6100-mm VAS).
Measurements and Main Results: The mean (SD) age was
59 (616) years, median mechanical ventilation days was 19.5
(interquartile range, 7–29 d), and 15 (30%) died in-hospital. Using the
card, 50(100%) identifiedaspiritual affiliation,47(94%)identifiedone
or more emotions, 45 (90%) rated their spiritual pain, and 36 (72%)
selected a chaplain intervention. Anxiety after the first visit decreased
31% (mean score change, 220; 95% confidence interval, 233 to 27).
Among 28 ICU survivors, 26 (93%) remembered the intervention and
underwent semistructured interviews, of whom 81% felt more capable
of dealing with their hospitalization and 0% felt worse. The 18
ICU survivors who underwent additional VAS testing during
semistructured follow-up interviews reported a 49-point reduction in
stress(95%confidenceinterval,272to224)andnosignificantchange
in physical pain that they attributed to picture-guided spiritual care.
Conclusions: Chaplain-led picture-guided spiritual care is feasible
among mechanically ventilated adults and shows potential for
reducing anxiety during and stress after an ICU admission.

 Mechanically ventilated patients in the
intensive care unit (ICU) experience
substantial psychoemotional distress,
because endotracheal intubation or
tracheostomy prevents the majority from
speaking, and most observers cannot
reliably lip-read (1–6). Attempts at having
mechanically ventilated patients write or
point to letters to spell out words have been
often unsuccessful, because handwriting is
often illegible and the process is time
consuming (7, 8). Nurse and chaplain
interpretations of nods and gesticulations
by mechanically ventilated patients are
sometimes accurate, but there are also
reports of misinterpretation causing
significant miscommunication (2, 9, 10).
When critically ill patients are unable
to self-report, nurses will often use
cardiorespiratory signs, ventilator
compliance, and facial expressions to
identify symptoms that are present.
However, similar changes in vital signs or
behaviors may indicate a variety of different
symptoms (9, 11).
Communication cards may improve
communication between mechanically
ventilated patients and their providers
(12, 13), but only one rigorous study exists
that evaluates communication cards as
part of a comprehensive communication
intervention with endotracheally intubated
ICU patients and their nurses (14). Since
the adoption of minimized sedation as an
ICU best practice (15, 16), it has been
estimated that half of mechanically
ventilated patients may benefit from
assistive communication tools (17).
The Joint Commission and the
National Quality Forum for Palliative
Care guidelines include spiritual care as a
component of their care standards (18, 19),
and studies in non-ICU settings have
shown that many patients find religion or
spirituality to be the most important factor
enabling them to cope with serious illness
(20–22). Although previous studies in the
ICU have shown that chaplain care is
associated with increased family satisfaction
(23, 24), the focus has traditionally been on
the family members of dying patients and
not the patients themselves (25). There is
growing recognition of a need for a
comprehensive approach to providing
proactive spiritual support to ICU patients
(24–28).
Like other healthcare providers in the
ICU, our chaplain experienced difficulty
with lip-reading and interpreting behavioral
signs in mechanically ventilated patients he
saw in consultation. Therefore, he created an
illustrated spiritual care communication
card to facilitate the assessment of
spiritual needs and guide spiritual care
in mechanically ventilated adults in a
systematic way that meets established
criteria of the Association of Professional
Chaplains’ Standards of Practice for
spiritual assessment and delivery of care in
acute care settings (29). The card contains
four sections that allow mechanically
ventilated patients to point to pictures and
words that indicate their (1) spiritual or
religious affiliation, (2) emotions, (3)
spiritual pain, and (4) desired chaplain
interventions.
We aimed to determine the feasibility
and measure the effects of chaplain-led
picture-guided spiritual care in
mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients.
We hypothesized that awake and alert
mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients
without delirium or dementia would be able
to identify their spiritual preferences and
needs using the illustrated communication
card and that, in turn, the chaplain would
provide spiritual care that would alleviate
their psychoemotional distress during and
after the ICU admission.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
We performed a single-center prospective
cohort study at an urban, tertiary care
medical center. Between March 2014 and
July 2015, we screened adults 18 years of age
or older with 6 or more hours of mechanical
ventilation who had no history of dementia,
no advanced chronic neurologic disease
(e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
Parkinson’s disease) or stroke with receptive
or expressive aphasias, were known to
understand English or Spanish, and who by
ICU nurse report had a Richmond Agitation
Sedation Score of 0 or 21 and followed
simple commands (30). Patients were
considered eligible if they were alert and
oriented to self, place, and time by nodding
appropriately to orientation questions and
were not delirious as measured by the
Confusion Assessment Method ICU survey
(31). We screened Monday to Friday when
the medical ICU (MICU) chaplain was
working and available to see adult ICU
patients, and on weekends when the
chaplain and at least one of the other staff
involved in screening and assessments were
on call. We preferentially screened MICU
patients, because our MICU chaplain
developed the spiritual care communication
card for use. When no MICU patients were
eligible, we then screened surgical ICU
(SICU) patients who met the above criteria
and who were not already receiving care by
another chaplain.
Given our patients’ frequent inability
to write, we obtained a waiver of signed
consent and reviewed with eligible patients
an information sheet that explained the
study procedures. Only those who nodded
in assent to participation were included in
the study. The study was approved by the
Columbia University Medical Center
Institutional Review Board.
Picture-guided Spiritual Care
Our MICU chaplain (J.N.B.) developed the
illustrated spiritual care communication
card (Figure 1; see Figure E1 in the online
supplement) and provided all of the
picture-guided spiritual care to study
participants, speaking either in English or
Spanish. He is a member of the Association
of Professional Chaplains, has a Master’s of
Divinity, and completed six units of
Clinical Pastoral Education accredited by
the Association for Clinical Pastoral
Education. He developed the illustrated
spiritual care communication card with
four sections that reflect the domains of
a spiritual assessment that would be
typically assessed by a chaplain through
conversation but instead can be assessed by
having the user point to pictures and words
to: (1) identify spiritual or religious
affiliations; (2) identify a range of feelings;
(3) rate spiritual pain (32); and (4) select a
desired religious, spiritual, or nonspiritual
intervention that a chaplain can offer
(Figure 1). He developed the range of
feelings a patient could identify based first
on the four classes of feelings that he was
trained to assess when caring for someone:
anger, happiness, sadness, and fear (33). He
then intuitively added five more emotions
to each class and worked with an illustrator
to create cartoon faces associated with each
of these emotions so that patients could
describe their feelings by pointing to one or
more of 24 emotions.
The chaplain first reviewed the
participant’s state of health by speaking
with providers and reviewing the medical
record. He then introduced himself to the
participant and led him or her through each

 of the four sections of the communication
card. This structured chaplain-led picture-
guided spiritual care meets Standards of
Practice by the Association of Professional
Chaplains by evaluating relevant
information pertinent to the care of a
recipient’s bio-psycho-social-spiritual/
religious health and by implementing a
culturally sensitive plan of care to promote
the well-being of the recipient (29). For
participants who did not select any desired
chaplain intervention, the chaplain offered
well wishes specific to their hospitalization.
The chaplain revisited participants during
their hospitalization if they desired a
chaplain intervention to be repeated
(e.g., prayer) or if they had ongoing
psychoemotional distress for which they
desired follow-up spiritual care. During
revisits, he used the communication card to
guide spiritual care only if a participant
remained mechanically ventilated.
Measurements
We assessed the feasibility of using the
illustrated communication card to guide
spiritual care by (1) measuring the
proportions of participants who were able
to identify or confirm their spiritual or
religious affiliation, identify at least one
emotion, rate their spiritual pain on a 0 to
10 integer scale, and select at least one
desired chaplain intervention when using
the communication card for the first time;
and by (2) measuring the time needed to
complete the four sections of the
communication card and the time of the
entire initial chaplain-led picture-guided
spiritual care consultation.
We measured the effect of chaplain-led
picture-guided spiritual care for
mechanically ventilated ICU patients using
a two-phase approach that is described in
detail in the online supplement. Briefly,
because we were initially unsure how
participants would react to engaging in
communication about their emotions and
spiritual needs, we first conducted

 semistructured exploratory interviews with
ICU survivors from the first half of study
participants (n = 25) to identify the
common symptoms picture-guided
spiritual care treated. On the basis of our
review of these interviews, we then added
100-mm visual analog scales (VASs) to
measure anxiety immediately before and
after the initial chaplain visit in the second
half of study participants (n = 25) and
6100-mm VAS to measure changes in
stress and pain attributed to chaplain-led
picture-guided spiritual care among those
who survived intensive care and were
awaiting hospital discharge.
Demographic and clinical variables were
obtained from the electronic medical record.
A priori, we planned subgroup analyses
comparing VAS anxiety and stress scores
between participants who were younger
versus older, religious versus nonreligious,
cared for in the MICU versus SICU, and
received picture-guided spiritual care in
English versus Spanish. Post hoc, we
compared VAS anxiety and stress scores
between organ transplant recipients and
participants without organ transplantation
and between decedents and ICU survivors.
Statistical Analysis
We present categorical data using
percentages and continuous data as mean
(6SD) or median (interquartile range
[IQR]). We compared 100-mm VAS
anxiety scores immediately before and after
the initial chaplain-led picture-guided
spiritual care consult using the Wilcoxon
signed-rank test and compared 6100-mm
VAS scores measuring change in stress and
pain attributed to spiritual care among ICU
survivors to 0 (no change), also using
Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Statistical
significance was defined as a two-tailed
P , 0.05. Analyses were performed with
Stata 13.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX).
Results
We screened 84 adult ICU patients receiving
mechanical ventilation; 27 were found to
have delirium and were initially excluded, but
5 had no delirium on a subsequent day of
screening and remained mechanically
ventilated, resulting in 62 eligible patients.
Nine (15%) declined to participate, one
(1.6%) enrolled but underwent lung
transplantation before receiving picture-
guided spiritual care, and two (3.2%) enrolled
but were too lethargic to use the card. Fifty
(81%) completed a feasibility assessment on
the same day after enrolling and were
followed until hospital discharge. Figure 2
details participant flow through the study.
Participants had a mean (SD) age
59 (616) years and a wide range of Acute
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation
II scores. The most common indications for
mechanical ventilation were respiratory
failure or distress and pneumonia.
Participants were of diverse races/ethnicities,
and 10 (20%) used the Spanish version of
the communication card. They had multiple
comorbidities (Charlson comorbidity index
median [IQR], 2.5 [1–4]). Although 14
participants (28%) were solid organ or bone
marrow transplantation recipients, only
6 (12%) underwent transplantation while
enrolled in the study (all lung transplants).
Participants received mechanical ventilation
for a median (IQR) of 19.5 (7–29) days, and
23 (46%) received a tracheostomy. Forty-two
(84%) met the most recent consensus
definition of chronic critical illness (34).
The in-hospital mortality was 30%, 17
participants (34%) were discharged home,
17 (34%) were discharged to skilled-care
facilities, and 1 (2%) was discharged to
hospice (Table 1).
Using the communication card for the
first time, participants’ spiritual affiliation
was identified 100% of the time, 47
participants (94%) were able to identify one
or more emotion, 45 participants (90%)
rated their spiritual pain, and 36 (72%)
selected a desired chaplain intervention.
It took participants a median (IQR) of
8.5 minutes (5–13) to complete the four
sections of the communication card, and it

 took the chaplain a median (IQR) of 18
(11–25) minutes to both use the card with
participants and provide a desired spiritual
care intervention (Table 2).
For 34 participants (68%), identifying a
spiritual affiliation consisted of the chaplain
pointing to the affiliation on the card that was
listed in the medical record or given by
family members and observing the subject
nod in acknowledgment. However, seven
participants (14%) used the card to identify a
spiritual affiliation that was different from
what was listed in the medical record.
Participants had diverse spiritual or religious
affiliations, with most being either Catholic
(56%) or Jewish (10%), and seven (14%)
identified themselves as agnostic or having no
spiritual or religious affiliation (Table 2).
Participants’ emotions varied widely
(Table 2, Table E1). Forty-eight participants
(51%) felt only negative emotions (fear,
sadness, and anger), and nine (19%)
reported only feeling happy. Fourteen
(30%) reported feeling both happy and
negative emotions. On a 0 to 10 integer
scale, participants’ mean (SD) spiritual pain
was 4.2 (63.7) (Table 2). Among the
36 participants (72%) who selected one or
more desired chaplain interventions, 75%
requested religious interventions and 33%
requested nonreligious interventions
(Table 2). Only one subject (2.7%)
indicated that he wished to be left alone
after using the first three sections of the
communication card. The chaplain
revisited study participants during their
hospitalization to provide additional
spiritual care a median (IQR) of two (zero
to three) times, with 70% of revisits lasting
less than 25 minutes (Table 2).
Among the second half of participants
(n = 25), in whom anxiety was measured by
VAS immediately before and after the
initial chaplain-led picture-guided spiritual
care, anxiety decreased from a mean (SD)
VAS score of 64 (629) to 44 (628) (mean
absolute reduction of 20 points, 95%
confidence interval [CI], 233 to 27;
P = 0.002; mean relative reduction, 31%; 95%
CI, 248% to 215%; P = 0.001) (Figure 3).
Among 28 ICU survivors who consented to
follow-up interviews, 26 (93%) remembered
receiving the chaplain’s picture-guided
spiritual care in the ICU and completed the
semistructured interviews. Eighty-one
percent reported that they felt more capable
of dealing with their hospitalization, 81% felt
more at peace, 71% felt more connected with
what is sacred, 96% would recommend

 chaplain-led picture-guided spiritual care to
others, and 0% felt worse after receiving
spiritual care (Table E2). Their responses
to an open-ended question about why
chaplain-led picture-guided spiritual care is
helpful are listed in Table 3 and Table E3.
Many participants report decreased
anxiety and stress due to being able to
communicate using the card, and several
describe improved coping having recognized
and acknowledged their feelings with the
chaplain. On average, ICU survivors who
underwent 6100-mm VAS testing at follow
up (n = 18) reported mean 49-point
reduction in stress (95% CI, 272 to 2 24;
P = 0.002) and no significant change in
physical pain due to chaplain-led picture-
guided spiritual care (Table E2).
Younger, nonreligious, English-
speaking MICU participants reported slightly
greater reductions in anxiety and stress than
older, religious, Spanish-speaking SICU
participants. Those who ultimately survived
the ICU tended to report greater reductions
in anxiety after the first chaplain visit than
those who ultimately died or were discharged
to hospice. The four participants (8%) who
underwent lung transplant during study
enrollment reported a similar reduction in
stress attributed to spiritual care compared
with both those who underwent organ
transplantation before the study period and
those without organ transplantation. Given
the small subsample sizes, these results
should be considered preliminary and
interpreted with caution (Table E4).

Definition of abbreviation: IQR = interquartile range. Data presented as n (%) unless otherwise noted.
Participants were allowed to select more than one emotion or chaplain intervention. Therefore,
percentages may add to up to greater than 100%.
*The chaplain first obtained a religious affiliation from the medical record or family, and the participant
nodded in acknowledgment when asked his/her preference.
†Participants pointed to cartoon faces with a descriptive word above each face (see Figure 1). There
were four general emotion categories, each with specific faces: (1): fear: afraid, worried, uneasy,
terrified, shocked, nervous; (2) sadness: sad, lonely, guilty, embarrassed, hopeless, helpless; (3)
anger: angry, annoyed, disappointed, overwhelmed, frustrated, betrayed; (4) happiness: happy,
relieved, excited, loved, comfortable, peaceful. Numbers and percentages of specific emotions
identified are listed in Table E1 in the online supplement.

 guide to assist chaplains with spiritual care
for awake and alert mechanically ventilated
adults in the ICU. Participants reported
an immediate reduction in anxiety after
receiving this care for the first time, and
those who survived intensive care reported a
reduction in stress that they attributed to
picture-guided spiritual care. To our
knowledge, this is the first clinical study
to test a structured, integrative, and
measureable approach to chaplain care
aimed at treating anxiety and stress and
improving coping in mechanically
ventilated ICU patients. Using this unique
spiritual assessment tool with ICU patients
opens a novel area of chaplaincy and
palliative care clinical research.
Picture-guided spiritual care may
reduce anxiety during and stress after an
ICU admission in several ways. Survivors
of mechanical ventilation report feeling
anxious and lonely because they cannot
communicate vocally (1, 5, 35). Using the
communication board with the chaplain
addresses a mechanically ventilated
patient’s fundamental need to express him
or herself and to be understood. Having
participants point to faces to identify their
emotions on the communication card
revealed that approximately 50% felt only
negative emotions, 30% felt both happy and
negative emotions, and 20% felt only
happy. On the basis of the chaplain’s
experience of providing spiritual care to
study participants, the high prevalence of
happiness seemed to reflect participants’
appreciation for still being alive and for
family support they were receiving. Several
ICU survivors reported in follow-up
interviews that acknowledging their
emotions with the chaplain was crucial to
helping them cope with their critical illness.
This finding is consistent with prior studies
in non-ICU settings that have shown many
patients find spiritual care to be the single
most important factor enabling them to cope
with a serious illness (20–22). More than
half of participants rated their spiritual pain
greater than or equal to 5 on a 0 to 10
integer scale, and higher spiritual pain
scores have been shown to be associated
with lower spiritual quality of life and
adverse physical and emotional symptoms
(32). The desired chaplain interventions
that a patient selected, whether or not
religious, focused on comforting the
patient and improving his or her well-
being in the context of both his or her
spiritual pain and critical illness.
This study answers calls for more
rigorous studies of spiritual and religious
interventions (36), a need to develop a
comprehensive approach to assess and meet
the spiritual needs of patients (24, 26, 37, 38),
and for research aimed at improving critical
illness survivorship (39). A 2012 Cochrane
review found inconclusive evidence that
palliative care teams with a chaplain help
terminally ill patients feel emotionally
supported, but note that patients’ emotions
and ability to cope were not well measured
(36). We specifically measured participants’
emotions, showed improvement in
symptoms of anxiety and stress, and elicited
feedback that suggests spiritual care helps
ICU survivors cope with critical illness. Prior
studies have shown that chaplain-led
spiritual care improves family satisfaction
with end-of-life care in the ICU (23, 24), but
our study is the first to proactively and
systematically engage mechanically
ventilated ICU patients who are not
necessarily dying. With technological
advances, many critically ill patients now
survive what were previously fatal illnesses
(40, 41), but survivors of mechanical
ventilation are increasingly recognized to
suffer from anxiety, depression, and post-
traumatic stress disorder (42–44). Our
finding that chaplain-led spiritual care
potentially improves stress after the ICU and
helps ICU survivors’ ability to cope raises the
possibility that chaplain-led picture-guided
spiritual care with follow up may be able to
help prevent or alleviate these psychiatric
sequelae of critical illness.
Our study has several limitations. A
single chaplain provided all of the picture-
guided spiritual care. Participants were
primarily MICU patients sampled from an
urban tertiary care center with several organ
transplantation programs, but our subgroup
analyses suggest little difference in the
magnitude of anxiety and stress reduction
in transplant and nontransplant patients
who received mechanical ventilation. The
feasibility of chaplain-led picture-guided
spiritual care needs to be externally
validated with other chaplains, in cardiac
and pediatric ICU patients, and in other
hospitals where case mix and patient care
may differ. These validation studies should
also evaluate the psychometrics of the
spiritual care communication card and
assess whether refinements to the card
should be made. Although other ICU
healthcare providers could potentially use
parts of the card to screen for patients with
Table 3. Intensive care unit survivors’
responses to an open-ended question
about why chaplain-led picture-guided
spiritual care is helpful
“It was very helpful at the time to just reset
everything, to gauge where you’re at and
where you need to be.”
“I’m normally not the most spiritual or if you
want to say religious person. The fact that
there’s different interventions that are
universally comforting—that’s really
helpful because you don’t know what kind
of patient you have. And I think anyone
would take a blessing, even if you’re the
most hardcore.”
“It’s a relief, a guide for expression.”
“It’s more than just a tool; it’s an outlet. You
need that.”
“A [chaplain visit] is soothing to the patient
and family: it’s ok to have all of these
feelings, that I can feel serenity from
sadness. It gives me permission to
feel all this and that that is ok and part
of the process of healing. Validation of it
being okay to feel how you feel. It’s ok
to be upset. Patients want to impress
doctors and nurses and they can’t
always.”
“It gave me more calmness, more
acceptance.”
“Made me think for sure. With the numbers.
How, for example, disappointed or excited
I was.. it made me think. Pretty helpful.
Especially the feelings page. Made me
think about how I felt about being afraid,
disappointed. Made me think about my
emotions—which was helpful. A lot of
times you get overwhelmed by your
feelings, especially when you’re sick or in
a moment of stress.”
“I just felt more at peace” because “I was
able to communicate.”
“It may not change the physical pain, but it
can help to reduce or decrease the pain by
relaxing or calming the patient.”
It’s helpful “that it even prompts you to think
about it all. When you’re lying there in pain
and anxiety, it’s difficult to even think.”
“The visit from the chaplain is extremely
helpful. Talking to a chaplain or a person
that has the ability to help give you interior
peace and to help you with your fears and
frustrations means a lot to anyone and
helps you to feel better.”

 spiritual care needs, we recommend at this
time that only chaplains use the card,
because they are formally trained in how to
best engage communication on spiritual
matters. We did not study how spiritual care
affected end-of-life care among decedents,
but prior studies have already shown a
benefit (23, 24). Future studies of chaplain-
led picture-guided spiritual care should
evaluate its effect on those who die in the
ICU and their families’ satisfaction with
ICU care. We limited our measurements of
symptoms to 100-mm VAS for anxiety after
the first visit and stress and pain among
ICU survivors at a single follow-up visit.
Future studies should consider using more
comprehensive and repeated assessments of
symptoms (45, 46), spiritual quality of life
(47), and coping (48–50) to determine the
optimal dose of spiritual care needed to
improve well-being. Although our quasi-
experimental study design shows a potential
for efficacy of chaplain-led picture-guided
spiritual care, there is no psychometric
measurement support for asking subjects to
recall stress reduction. Furthermore, only a
randomized controlled trial can prove
efficacy, and measurements of anxiety,
depression, and post-traumatic stress
disorder after hospital discharge should be
considered as outcomes among ICU
survivors.
In conclusion, our findings
demonstrate that chaplain-led picture-
guided spiritual care is feasible among
awake and alert mechanically ventilated
adults and suggest that it may reduce anxiety
during and stress after an ICU admission.
Using this novel picture guide will facilitate
a paradigm shift in the role of chaplains in
acute care settings. Instead of primarily
being consulted just before a patient’s
death in the ICU, chaplains can now
provide interactive spiritual support to
mechanically ventilated ICU patients.
This strategy represents a significant step
forward in being able to integrate
spiritual care with intensive care and
shows promise to improve adult patients’
well-being both during and after critical
illness. n
