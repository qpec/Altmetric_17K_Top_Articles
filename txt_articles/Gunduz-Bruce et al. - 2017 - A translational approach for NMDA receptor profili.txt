New Findings
r What is the central question of this study?
Can the change in plasma arginine vasopressin concentration (P[AVP]) in response to osmotic
stimulation (POsm) serve as a biomarker for NMDA receptor signalling in schizophrenia and
depression and thereby distinguish between these mental illnesses?
r What is the main finding and its importance?
In response to hyperosmotic challenge, depressed subjects showed increased P[AVP] response
compared with healthy control and schizophrenic subjects. However, schizophrenic subjects
were not different from healthy control subjects in this small sample. The ‘P[AVP] response to
POsm’ is a suitable biomarker to distinguish depressed versus schizophrenic patients when used
with psychiatric screening. This is the first objective physiological measure for schizophrenia
or depression.
Altered NMDA receptor activity and glutamate signalling might underlie the pathogenesis of
both schizophrenia and depression in subgroups of patients. In schizophrenia, pharmacological
modelling,post-mortemandimagingdatasuggestreducedNMDAsignalling.Incontrast,recent
clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of the NMDA antagonist ketamine in severely depressed
patients suggest increased NMDA receptor signalling. We conducted a proof-of-concept study
to assess whether there is any in vivo evidence for an inverse association in depression and
schizophrenia with respect to the NMDA receptor function. For this purpose, we used a
translational approach, based on findings from animal studies that NMDA receptor is a key
mediator of arginine vasopressin (AVP) release into the bloodstream. Using hypertonic saline
to increase plasma osmolality (POsm) and thereby induce AVP release, as done in animal studies,
we found that in depressed patients the NMDA receptor-mediated AVP release induced by
hypertonic saline infusion was significantly increased [0.24 (0.15) pg ml−1 mosmol−1, P < 0.05]
compared with schizophrenia patients [0.07 (0.07) pg ml−1 mosmol−1]. Slopes for healthy
control subjects were 0.11 (0.09) pg ml−1 mosmol−1 which was less than the depressed
group. These findings are consistent with implicated NMDA receptor-related abnormalities

Introduction
The NMDA receptor is a major subtype of glutamate
receptor that mediates fast synaptic transmission in the
CNS. Reduced NMDA receptor (NMDAR) signalling has
long been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia,
as reviewed in detail elsewhere (Olney & Farber, 1995;
Krystal et al. 2002; Arnsten, 2011), and thought to underlie
both the cognitive dysfunction and symptom profile
observed in this disorder. Of note, NMDAR antagonists
provide a pharmacological animal model of schizophrenia
for drug development (Jentsch & Roth, 1999) and were
found to increase symptom severity when administered to
patients (Lahti et al. 1995, 2001; Malhotra et al. 1997).
In contrast to schizophrenia, some depressed patients
show a remarkable improvement following NMDA
antagonist administration (Berman et al. 2000; Zarate
et al. 2006), raising the possibility of increased NMDA
receptor signalling in depression. In the pathogenesis
of depression, the recognition of a glutamate-mediated
‘neuroplasticity hypothesis’ is relatively recent (Pittenger
& Duman, 2008; Sanacora et al. 2012) and supported by
several lines of evidence, including post-mortem (Ongur
et al. 1998; Rajkowska et al. 1999; Miguel-Hidalgo et al.
2000, 2002; Cotter et al. 2001; Bowley et al. 2002; Hamidi
et al. 2004; Khundakar et al. 2011), imaging (Yuksel &
Ongur, 2010) and clinical trials data (Berman et al. 2000;
Zarate et al. 2006; DiazGranados et al. 2010).
As
both
schizophrenia
and
depression
are
heterogeneous, it is highly likely that the suspected
abnormal NMDAR signalling in these disorders represent
subsets of patients. For example, the administration of the
NMDAR antagonist ketamine affects some schizophrenic
patients more than others, as evidenced by high variability
of the response pattern among patients (Lahti et al.
2001). Likewise, the antidepressant effect of ketamine is
also variable, because one-third of treatment-resistant
patients with depression do not respond to ketamine
(Moaddel et al. 2015), and ketamine may have a
preferential positive effect in depressed patients with
high anxiety levels (Ionescu et al. 2014). Therefore, it
would be simplistic to propose that NMDAR abnormality
solely would explain the entire pathophysiology of these
disorders.
As yet, in vivo assessment of the NMDAR in humans
is not possible. Thus, the need for development of
a blood-based biomarker that represents the NMDAR
signalling in schizophrenia and depression is essential.
Such
a
biomarker
would
enable
us
to
evaluate
the vulnerability of individuals towards schizophrenia
versus
depression,
especially
in
early
illness
when
there is significant overlap in the symptoms and
consequently diagnostic uncertainty. Schizophrenia most
often manifests during adolescence. Initial signs and
symptoms are typically non-specific, ranging from subtle
changes in behaviour to depressive symptoms, sometimes
including normal adolescent behaviour, such as academic
decline and social withdrawal. In addition, a biomarker
could be used to identify patients with abnormal NMDAR
signalling among those with established diagnoses in
order to offer targeted treatments using glutamatergic
agents.
One approach to a blood-based biomarker would be to
examine hormones that are regulated by the NMDAR in
the CNS. As hormones are directly released into the blood-
stream, assessment of such hormones in peripheral blood
could serve as a biomarker of the CNS disorders that are
associated with NMDAR signalling. Arginine vasopressin
(AVP) is one such hormone whose release is regulated
by the NMDAR. Arginine vasopressin is synthesized in
the cell bodies of magnocellular neurosecretary cells,
which are large neurons located in the hypothalamic
nuclei that extend to the posterior pituitary and
terminate on the pituitary portal system. Magnocellular
neurosecretory cells express functional NMDA receptors
and release AVP in response to glutamatergic activation
(McKinley et al. 1992; Richard & Bourque, 1995;
Bourque, 1998; Swenson et al. 1998; Leng et al. 2001;
Sladek, 2004). Glutamatergic synapses that terminate on
the magnocellular neurosecretary cells contain NMDA,
α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid
(AMPA) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (Panatier,
2009).
Physiological studies have demonstrated that the
plasma AVP (P[AVP]) response to plasma osmolality (POsm)
is sensitive to the function of the NMDA receptor. When
rats are infused with hypertonic saline, POsm increases
linearly during the infusion, as in humans, producing
a linear P[AVP] response to POsm. However, when rats
are pretreated with the non-competitive NMDA receptor
antagonist MK-801 and then administered hypertonic

Osmotic regulation of vasopressin in depression and schizophrenia
saline, the slope of the P[AVP] response to POsm decreases
(Onaka & Yagi, 2001), suggesting that the NMDA receptor
signalling modulates the release of AVP. Therefore, the
purpose of the present study was to determine whether
the P[AVP] response to POsm could serve as a biomarker
for the NMDA receptor signalling in schizophrenia and
depression.
As mentioned earlier, although resting P[AVP] is low,
AVP release is sensitive to increases in POsm as slight as
5 mosmol kg−1 (2–3%). Moreover, above this threshold
for osmotic AVP stimulation, the P[AVP]–POsm relationship
is tight and linear (Calzone et al. 2001; Stachenfeld et al.
2001).WehavesafelyincreasedthePOsm byadministration
of hypertonic saline infusion (HSI) in a number of
populations (Stachenfeld et al. 1996, 1998, 2001; Calzone
et al. 2001). We therefore propose that because the release
of AVP is NMDA receptor dependent, we can determine
the extent of NMDA receptor activity in humans by
measuring the osmotically controlled release of AVP
using HSI. Specifically, we would expect the magnitude
of the linear slope of the P[AVP]–POsm relationship to
serve as an indicator of the NMDA receptor activity. We
hypothesized that the lower NMDA receptor signalling
in schizophrenics would produce a flatter HSI-induced
P[AVP]–POsm slope compared with healthy individuals
without mental illness consistent with disrupted NMDAR
function. In contrast, we hypothesized that the greater
NMDA receptor signalling in depression would produce
a steeper HSI-induced P[AVP]–POsm slope compared with
healthycontrolsubjectswithoutmentalillness,andsteeper
than in schizophrenics.
Methods
Ethical approval. All subjects gave written informed
consent to participate in the study, which conformed to
the guidelines contained in the Declaration of Helsinki
and received prior approval by the Human Investigation
Committee of Yale School of Medicine (approval no.
0910005875) and the Human Subjects Subcommittee
of the VA Connecticut Healthcare System (Project No:
HGB0006). Upon establishment of eligibility, subjects
were scheduled for a single test day at the John Pierce
Laboratory, New Haven, CT, USA.
Overview. We recruited men and women with a
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
4th Edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis of schizophrenia or
unipolar depression and healthy control subjects via
referrals from the outpatient clinics of Yale School of
Medicine, VA Medical Center and the local clinics in the
New Haven area. All subjects received a brief telephone
screening for basic eligibility, such as age, sex and
medical history, after which they were brought in for
the consenting process and screening procedures. These
procedures included a history and physical examination,
laboratory assessment, ECG and a structured interview.
Trained research personnel conducted The Structured
Clinical Interview (SCID) using the DSM-IV, patient and
non-patient versions for diagnostic assessment. Trained
research assistants determined subjects’ diagnoses by
conducting structured interviews, which is standard of
practice in psychiatric diagnoses, and also by the American
Board of Psychiatry and Neurology certified psychiatrist
(prinicipal investigator of the study).
Protocol
Subjects. In order to reduce individual variability in
hydration levels, the subjects were instructed to eat only
a prescribed low-fat breakfast, drink 5 ml kg−1 water
and refrain from alcohol and caffeine for 12 h before
testing. Subjects arrived at the laboratory at 0800 h.
Hydration state was assessed by urine specific gravity. If
specific gravity was >1.02, the subjects were given another
5 ml kg−1 of water to drink, followed by a 60 min control
period. The subjects were seated in a comfortable chair for
catheter placement and took the semi-recumbent position
that was maintained throughout the experiment (ambient
temperature = 28°C). During a 60 min resting period,
the subjects were instrumented for the measurement of
plasma variables (using a 22 gauge Teflon I.V. cannula),
heart rate and arterial blood pressure (Colin Medical
Instruments,Komaki,Japan)andbloodoxygenationusing
a pulse oximeter.
Testing procedures. We infused hypertonic saline (3.0%
NaCl) at 0.1 ml kg−1 min−1 for 120 min to examine
the osmotic regulation of AVP in the subjects. We
obtained blood samples at 15, 25, 35, 45, 60, 75,
90, 105 and 120 min during the infusion, along with
measurements of blood pressure, heart rate and thirst
sensation.
After the infusion, we collected a second urine sample
and, following a 30 min stabilization period, the subjects
drank 15 ml kg−1 of water over 30 min. After water
ingestion, the subjects rested quietly for 60 min, at
the end of which a third urine sample was collected.
During this recovery period, blood samples were obtained
at 30 min intervals, and blood pressure and heart
rate were monitored at 10 min intervals. Haematocrit,
haemoglobin, osmolality and concentrations of AVP
and electrolytes were determined in all blood samples.
Volume, osmolality and electrolyte concentrations were
determined in all urine samples for a comprehensive
characterization of the water regulation abnormalities in
schizophrenia that are dependent on the P[AVP] response
to POsm.

analysis. Blood
samples
were
separated
immediately
into
aliquots
and
first
analysed
for
haemoglobin and haematocrit. A second aliquot was
transferred to a heparinized tube, and all other aliquots
were placed in prechilled tubes containing EDTA. The
tubes were centrifuged and the plasma was taken off the
heparinized samples and analysed for sodium, potassium
and osmolality. The EDTA samples were analysed for
concentrations of AVP. Plasma and urine sodium and
potassium were measured by flame photometry and POsm
by freezing point depression.
The P[AVP] was determined after extraction from
plasma on octadecylsilane cartridges (SEP-PAK C18;
Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA). Extracted
samples were assayed using a disequilibrium assay, with
the extracts incubated with the antiserum at 4°C for
72 h, followed by the addition of
125I-labelled AVP
(New England Nuclear, Boston, MA, USA). Bovine
albumin-coated charcoal was used for separation of free
and antibody-bound labelled AVP. This assay is highly
specific for AVP, with the antiserum prepared against
a lysine vasopressin–thyroglobin conjugate, and has a
sensitivity of 0.6 pg ml−1. Extraction recovery of AVP
was determined using plasma spiked with a known
concentration of AVP (Peninusula Laboratories, Belmont,
CA, USA). The recovery sample was extracted and
analysed along with the subjects’ samples. The extraction
recovery was 89%. Intra- and interassay coefficients of
variation for the midrange standards (2.3 pg ml−1) were
9.2 and 4.6%, respectively.
Thirst ratings. We assessed thirst by asking the subject
to make a mark on a line rating scale in response to
the question, ‘How thirsty do you feel now?’ The line
is 175 mm in length and is marked ‘not at all’ on one
end and ‘extremely thirsty’ at the 125 mm point. We
told subjects that they could mark beyond the extremely
thirsty point if they wished and might even extend the
line if they felt it necessary. This method was developed by
Marks et al. (1988) and has been used with great success
in the evaluation of several sensory systems. We have
found an extraordinarily good relationship between the
perception of thirst and plasma osmolality during HSI
and dehydration in young volunteers.
Statistical analysis
All
data
were
first
summarized
descriptively,
and
distributional assumptions for continuous variables were
tested using Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests and normal
probability plots. When normality was not satisfied,
transformations were considered, and if it was not possible
to normalize the data, non-parametric methods were
used.Demographicswerecomparedbetweengroupsusing
ANOVA for continuous measures and Fisher’s exact tests
for categorical variables.
Mixed effects models were used to test for differences
by group and time in all repeatedly measured continuous
outcomes.Group[healthycontrol(HC),depression(Dep)
and Schizophrenia (Sch)], time (available time points)
and the interaction between group and time were the
predictors in the models. Subject was the clustering
factor. The best-fitting variance–covariance matrix for
each model was selected based on the Schwarz Bayesian
criterion. Tests of simple effects and pairwise comparisons
were performed to explain significant interactions in the
models. Residual plots were used to evaluate the fit of the
model to the data. Sensitivity analyses with sex as a fixed
covariate were also performed.
The relationship between P[AVP] and plasma osmolality
was assessed using a mixed model, with AVP as the
dependent variable, group (HC, Dep and Sch), plasma
osmolality and the interaction between group and plasma
osmolality as predictors. This analysis was restricted to
the time points during the infusion. For this analysis, a
model with random intercept and slope for osmolality
fitted the best. This model allows the between-subject
heterogeneity in slopes to be taken into account and
accounts for the correlations of repeated measures within
individual. Pairwise slope comparisons between the
different groups were performed to explain interaction
effects. As a sensitivity analysis, a general linear model and
a non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test were also used to
compare the slopes for the relationship between P[AVP] and
POsm between groups. The dependent variables in these
models were individual slopes calculated using ordinary
linear regression based on all available P[AVP] and POsm
data for each individual during the infusion.

is expected for healthy control subjects. This subject was
also unusual in his response to the thirst rating, reporting
no thirst at baseline and no change throughout the
experiment. We kept this subject in the database because
we could not rule out possibilities such as anatomical
defects or pituitary lesions. Low slope values such as
this could also be caused by central diabetes insipidus,
although patients with central diabetes insipidus have
intact thirst sensation, unlike this subject (Verbalis,

The slope of the P[AVP] response to POsm is calculated by the slope of the regression line of the P[AVP]–POsm
relationship. The calculated osmotic threshold for P[AVP] represents the maximal POsm value at which P[AVP]

individuals with early symptoms convert to schizophrenia
over 2.5 years (Cannon et al. 2008). A similar percentage
of patients develop mood disorders, and some may
grow out of these early symptoms. This presents
major ethical challenges for early intervention in both
disorders because of false-positive and false-negative
diagnoses by current interview-based assessments. Thus,
to distinguish schizophrenia from depression and even
normal adolescent behaviour, an objective assessment of
the NMDA receptor signalling is crucial for diagnostic
guidance and early intervention.
We conducted this proof-of-concept study to assess
the central NMDA receptor signalling in healthy control
subjects, subjects with schizophrenia and subjects with
depression. Based on animal findings, we stimulated the
activity of the hypothalamic NMDA receptor by increasing
plasma osmolality via I.V. hypertonic saline and measured
the concentration of AVP in the peripheral blood over
time. Consistent with our hypothesis, we demonstrated
that in response to the hyperosmotic challenge, subjects
with depression showed a significantly increased AVP
response compared with both healthy control subjects
and schizophrenic subjects. However, although subjects
with schizophrenia showed a decreased AVP response
compared with the depressed group, they did not differ
significantly from the healthy controls. Nonetheless, the
lowest values were observed in the schizophrenia group,
which may represent a subgroup of patients with reduced
NMDAR signalling. Hence, our findings support the use
of ‘P[AVP] response to POsm’ as a potential biomarker to
distinguish depressed versus schizophrenic patients when
used together with psychiatric screening when there is
diagnostic uncertainty.
A potential caveat is that there was some overlap
across the groups, so although this measure is a potential
biomarker, it requires further testing and should be used
along with an overall diagnostic battery. Nonetheless, our
data will certainly contribute to our understanding of the
pathophysiology of both schizophrenia and depression. It
is well recognized that both schizophrenia and depression
are heterogeneous conditions, and there may be different
underlying scientific underpinnings among patients in
each disorder (Andreasen & Carpenter, 1993; Sullivan
et al. 2000; Kennedy et al. 2003; Hasler et al. 2004). Both
schizophrenia and depression also show differences in
course, treatment response, functionality and prognosis.
In this context, our method, for the first time, identifies
subgroups of patients within the schizophrenia group
with indication of low NMDAR activity and subgroups
of patients within the depression group high NMDAR

activity. Therefore, this method has potential to identify a
particular subtype of patients in each disorder, and thus is
a crucial step forward.
Previously,
HSIs
have
been
administered
to
schizophrenic patients in order to study the underlying
physiological abnormalities in a subset of schizophrenic
patients with polydipsia (Goldman et al. 1996). In this
previous study, polydipsic patients demonstrated the
lowest AVP response to hypertonic stimulation. To our
knowledge, this protocol has not been used in depressed
patients previously. Importantly, no prior studies have
examine the P[AVP] response to POsm in these groups
compared with each other or compared with a healthy
control group. In the present study, our schizophrenic
subjects were not polydipsic, as assessed by clinical
interview and laboratory values. In addition, their urine
osmolality were somewhat higher than that the other
groups at baseline.
NMDA
antagonists
are
used
to
provide
pharmacological animal models of schizophrenia in
drug development. Rodents pretreated with NMDA
antagonists also show a decreased AVP response to
hypertonic stimulation (Onaka & Yagi, 2001; Yamaguchi
& Watanabe, 2002). These observations are consistent
with reduced NMDAR activity in schizophrenia, at least
in some patients. It could be argued that the subunit
composition of the hypothalamic NMDA receptor
may be significantly different from that in those brain
regions implicated in the disorder, such as the prefrontal
cortex. However, the composition of the hypothalamic
NMDA receptor includes all four subunits of the NMDA
receptor heteromer (NR2A, NR2B, NR2C and NR2D), in
addition to the obligatory NR1 (Doherty & Sladek, 2011).
The similarity of the hypothalamic NMDA receptor
composition to most central NMDA receptors provides
reassurance that our approach is representative of the
implicated NMDA receptor dysfunction in schizophrenia.
Finally, to our knowledge, there are a handful of hormones
that may be regulated by stimulation of the NMDA
receptor in addition to AVP, such as gonadotrophin-
releasing hormone (Yin et al. 2007), prolactin (D’Aniello
et al. 2000) and leptin (Carbone et al. 2005). No
direct examinations have been made between these
neuroendocrine systems in depression and schizophrenia
with respect to the NMDA receptors, but this might be an
interesting area for future research.
We found a significantly greater P[AVP] response to a
changeinPOsm inthedepressedgroupcomparedwithboth
healthy control subjects and subjects with schizophrenia.
To the extent that the response to the NMDA antagonist
ketamine in depression suggests overactive NMDAR
signalling,ourfindingisconsistentwiththisinterpretation
in a subgroup of subjects, as three of the seven depressed
subjects showed the highest responses. Also of interest
is the spread of these slopes within the depressed group
(Fig. 3). Based on our understanding of the NMDAR, we
suspect that the members of this group in the upper range
represent patients with refractory depression, although
thishypothesisrequiresfurthertesting.Anotherlimitation
of our results is that we had a small sample size; hence, the
chance of false-positive or false-negative findings cannot
be overlooked. Replication of our results in a larger sample
is needed.
Potential medication effects also deserve comment,
because all of our patients were treated with antipsychotics
in the schizophrenia group and antidepressants in
the depressed group, and this constitutes a major
limitation in our study. Water regulation abnormalities
in schizophrenia have been documented before the
availability of antipsychotics (Hoskins, 1933; Sleeper,
1935) and are also observed in antipsychotic-free
patients (Hariprasad et al. 1980). In 1933, before the
discovery of antipsychotics, Hoskins intensively studied
54 schizophrenic patients and found that that the average
24 h urine volume (obtained by catheter from all subjects)
in the patients (2602 ± 120 ml) was twice the normal
amount in healthy subjects (1328 ± 83 ml). In some
patients, urine volume was 3–8 l day−1. In the other
study, in 92 patients the mean urine volume was similarly
increased, at 2532 ± 172 ml (Hariprasad et al. 1980).
More detailed studies showed that patients’ ability to
concentrate or dilute urine was within the normal range
and that restricted water intake did not lead to a craving
for water for schizophrenic subjects, in sharp contrast to
what is observed in diabetes insipidus. Animal studies
have shown either no effect of antipsychotics (Forsling
et al. 1988; Hirayama et al. 2001) or an increased P[AVP]
response to POsm (Wells & Forsling, 1992). Collectively,
these data suggest that antipsychotic treatments are not
causal in water regulation abnormalities in schizophrenia.
Toourknowledge,theP[AVP] responsetoPOsm hasnotbeen
studied in patients with depression or in animal models of
depression,butinratstheP[AVP] responsetoPOsm increases
with acute treatment and decreases with chronic (21 day)
treatment with fluoxetine (selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitor, a commonly used antidepressant; Faull et al.
1993). However, SSRIs may induce hyponatraemia from
inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, although
this occurs primarily in the elderly and rarely in the
age group studied here. Nonetheless, these types of
medications remain a potential a contributory factor in
the few subjects taking them in our investigation. Based
on this finding, although clearly more research needs to
be done, our finding of an increased AVP response in
depression may even be an underestimation.
There is also evidence suggesting that the AVP response
to hyperosmotic stimulation is genetically regulated. The
variability among dizygotic twins (r = 0.24) and high
correlation in monozygotic twins (r = 0.94) in the general
population indicates that the robust genetic mechanism

Conclusions
Our findings may represent the first in vivo evidence that
in depression the central NMDA receptor signalling is
enhanced and that in schizophrenia it may be decreased,
at least in comparison to depression. Once replicated in
larger samples and fully developed, our approach might
be used to detect vulnerability towards depression and
schizophrenia in individuals early in the disease process
and enable early intervention in a subgroup of patients. In
addition, this approach might be useful in quantifying the
central NMDA receptor responsiveness in individuals and
guide clinicians in targeted drug treatment using novel
glutamatergic agents.
