onvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) currently affects between 
2 and 4 million people in the United States, and the preva-
lence is increasing.1,2 AF causes ischemic stroke, and long-term 
anticoagulation with warfarin or the target-specific oral antico-
agulants can safely reduce the risk of ischemic stroke.3–8 Device-
based alternatives to anticoagulation that attempt to exclude the 
left atrial appendage (LAA) from the systemic circulation have 
been developed.9–15 The Watchman device (Boston Scientific, 
Plymouth, MN), a catheter-based, self-expanding LAA occlud-
ing device, has been studied in 2 relatively small randomized 
trials against warfarin.16–18 The results of these trials were 
disparate, resulting in significant uncertainty in the clinical 
community about the value of this new treatment paradigm. 
This uncertainty was reflected in a protracted US Food and 
Drug Administration evaluation of the Watchman device that 
ultimately resulted in approval in March 2015.

Original Article
Background—Randomized trials of left atrial appendage (LAA) closure with the Watchman device have shown 
varying results, and its cost effectiveness compared with anticoagulation has not been evaluated using all available 
contemporary trial data.
Methods and Results—We used a Markov decision model to estimate lifetime quality-adjusted survival, costs, and cost 
effectiveness of LAA closure with Watchman, compared directly with warfarin and indirectly with dabigatran, using data 
from the long-term (mean 3.8 year) follow-up of Percutaneous Closure of the Left Atrial Appendage Versus Warfarin 
Therapy for Prevention of Stroke in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation (PROTECT AF) and Prospective Randomized 
Evaluation of the Watchman LAA Closure Device in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation (PREVAIL) randomized trials. 
Using data from PROTECT AF, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios compared with warfarin and dabigatran 
were $20 486 and $23 422 per quality-adjusted life year, respectively. Using data from PREVAIL, LAA closure was 
dominated by warfarin and dabigatran, meaning that it was less effective (8.44, 8.54, and 8.59 quality-adjusted life years, 
respectively) and more costly. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000 per quality-adjusted life year, LAA closure 
was cost effective 90% and 9% of the time under PROTECT AF and PREVAIL assumptions, respectively. These results 
were sensitive to the rates of ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage for LAA closure and medical anticoagulation.
Conclusions—Using data from the PROTECT AF trial, LAA closure with the Watchman device was cost effective; 
using PREVAIL trial data, Watchman was more costly and less effective than warfarin and dabigatran. PROTECT AF 
enrolled more patients and has substantially longer follow-up time, allowing greater statistical certainty with the cost-
effectiveness results. However, longer-term trial results and postmarketing surveillance of major adverse events will be 
vital to determining the value of the Watchman in clinical practice.  (Circ Arrhythm Electrophysiol. 2016;9:e003407.

≥1 who were randomly assigned to LAA occlusion with the 
Watchman device and planned warfarin discontinuation or war-
farin therapy.16 At a mean follow-up of 18 months, LAA occlu-
sion was noninferior to warfarin for the composite end point 
of stroke, systemic embolism, or cardiovascular death.16 At a 
mean follow-up of 3.8 years, patients in the device group had a 
significantly lower risk of the same composite end point and the 
independent end points of stroke or systemic embolism, cardio-
vascular mortality, and all-cause mortality.18 However, there 
was a substantial rate of periprocedural complications, includ-
ing stroke and pericardial effusion, and implant failure.16
Prospective Randomized Evaluation of the Watchman 
LAA Closure Device in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation 
(PREVAIL) was a confirmatory, US-based trial that randomly 
assigned 407 patients to LAA occlusion with Watchman or 
warfarin.17 The patients in this study had somewhat higher risk 
for stroke than those in PROTECT AF with a higher mean 
age (74 versus 72 years in the device group), higher CHADS2 
score (2.6 versus 2.2), and higher rate of previous stroke or 
transient ischemic attack (27.5% versus 17.7%). At 18 months, 
the rates of the composite end point of stroke, systemic embo-
lism, and cardiovascular mortality were similar (0.064 in the 
device group versus 0.063 in the control group), but the device 
did not achieve the prespecified criteria for noninferiority 
because of large 95% confidence intervals. Periprocedural 
safety events with LAA closure were substantially lower in 
PREVAIL than in PROTECT AF. However, the rates of intra-
cranial hemorrhage (ICH) and major extracranial hemorrhage 
were substantially higher in the device arm of the study.
The primary cost-effectiveness study on LAA closure to 
date showed that the technology may be cost effective but used 
only the 18-month PROTECT AF data for model assump-
tions and a Canadian healthcare system payer perspective.19 
A follow-up analysis incorporating longer-term PROTECT 
AF data similarly demonstrated that LAA closure may be cost 
effective relative to medical anticoagulation, but this study 
excluded the conflicting data from PREVAIL.20 We evaluated 
the quality-adjusted survival, costs, and cost effectiveness of 
the Watchman device for LAA closure compared with warfa-
rin using the most contemporary clinical trial data and a US 
payer perspective. Given the divergent results of PROTECT 
AF and PREVAIL with respect to safety and efficacy, and the 
marked difference in follow-up (3.8-year average follow-up 
versus 18 months), we did not perform meta-analysis or pool-
ing of underlying data inputs but rather presented our cost-
effectiveness estimates for the 2 trials separately. In addition, 
given that the healthcare landscape now includes the alterna-
tive to treat AF patients with the target-specific oral anticoagu-
lants, we compared LAA closure and warfarin to dabigatran 
as a broadly representative agent in this new class of drugs.
Methods
Decision Model
We used a Markov model21 to perform a decision analysis compar-
ing 3 treatment strategies for the prevention of thromboembolism in 
patients with AF: adjusted-dose warfarin with a target international 
normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0, dabigatran 150 mg twice daily, and 
LAA closure with planned discontinuation of anticoagulation. Our 
base case consisted of a hypothetical cohort of patients aged 70 years 
with AF at increased risk for stroke (ie, CHADS2 score ≥1) and no 
contraindications to anticoagulation.
Most health states in the model have been previously described22 
and included healthy with AF, reversible ischemic neurological defi-
cit, ischemic stroke (mild or moderate to severe), ICH (mild or mod-
erate to severe), combined stroke and ICH, myocardial infarction 
(MI), systemic embolism, and death (Figure 1).4 We applied utilities 
and costs to each outcome in 2-week increments during its expected 
duration and discounted costs and benefits at 3% per year.23
For LAA occlusion, we created 2 sets of model inputs, based on 
PROTECT AF and PREVAIL, and compared both sets of model results 
to those of warfarin and dabigatran treatment. Risks for adverse events 
included in our model were generally derived from the event rates 
published in the PROTECT AF, PREVAIL, and RE-LY (Randomized 
Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy; trial of dabigatran 
versus warfarin) trials unless stated otherwise.4,5,17,18 Because PROTECT 
AF data have been published in several iterations, we used the peripro-
cedural complication rates from the index publication16 and long-term 
event dates from the most recent publication based on mean 3.8-year 
follow-up data.18 For values not available in the published literature, we 
identified adverse event rates from the Food and Drug Administration 
filing.24 For conditions not included in our model, such as cancer, we 
assumed that event rates were similar across all treatments. For each 
treatment, we quantified quality-adjusted survival, adverse event risk, 
and net costs to age 100 years or until death (whichever occurred ear-
lier). Model building and analyses were performed using TreeAge Pro 
Suite (TreeAge Software, Williamstown, MA) and Microsoft Excel 
(Microsoft, Redmond, WA).
Probability of Adverse Outcomes in the Decision Model
Treatment Assumptions
In PROTECT AF, the occlusion device was implanted in 408 of 449 
patients (88%) in whom it was attempted. Patients for whom device 
implantation was unsuccessful were treated with warfarin. For pa-
tients assigned to the device arm of PROTECT AF, we assumed that 
clinical adverse events could occur in the periprocedural period or 
during the long-term period thereafter. In PROTECT AF, for the first 
45 days after device placement, patients were maintained on warfarin 
anticoagulation and aspirin 81 to 325 mg daily. Eighty-six percent of 
patients were then transitioned to clopidogrel 75 mg daily and aspi-
rin for day 45 until 6 months, but 14% were maintained on warfarin 
and aspirin until 6 months because of incomplete appendage clo-
sure, based on blood flow around the device demonstrated on trans-
esophageal echocardiography. After 6 months, 92% patients who had 
WHAT IS KNOWN
• Randomized trials of left atrial appendage (LAA) 
closure with the Watchman device have shown vary-
ing results, and its cost-effectiveness compared to 
anticoagulation has not been evaluated using all 
available contemporary trial data.
WHAT THE STUDY ADDS
• Using data from the PROTECT AF trial, LAA clo-
sure with the Watchman device was cost-effective.
• Using PREVAIL trial data, Watchman was more 
costly and less effective than warfarin and dabigatran.
• PROTECT AF enrolled more patients and has sub-
stantially longer follow-up time, allowing greater 
statistical certainty with the cost-effectiveness results, 
but longer term trial results and postmarketing surveil-
lance of major adverse events will be vital to deter-
mining the value of the Watchman in clinical practice.

successful LAA closure were transitioned to aspirin therapy only, and 
the remaining 8% were maintained on warfarin indefinitely because 
of incomplete appendage closure.
In PREV
AIL, the LAA closure device was implanted in 252 of 265 
patients (95%) in whom it was attempted. The same medication treat-
ment paradigms were used in PREVAIL and PROTECT AF as specified 
by the trial protocols. Ninety-two percent of patients were then transi-
tioned to clopidogrel 75 mg daily and aspirin 81 to 325 mg daily for day 
45 until 6 months, but 8% were maintained on warfarin until 6 months 
because of incomplete appendage closure, based on blood flow around 
the device demonstrated on transesophageal echocardiography. After 6 
months, 99% of patients who had successful LAA closure were transi-
tioned to aspirin therapy only, and the remaining 1% was maintained on 
warfarin indefinitely because of incomplete appendage closure.
Mortality rates were adjusted for age (beginning at age 70 years). 
The presence of AF and antithrombotic therapy were accounted for in 
our model by the clinical event rates of the intention-to-treat analyses 
of PROTECT AF, PREVAIL and RE-LY.3,4,18,25–29
Periprocedural Adverse Events
The PROTECT AF model assumed that in the periprocedural period 
after LAA closure, 1.5% of patients had a serious pericardial effusion, 
1.1% of patients had an ischemic stroke, 0.6% of patients had a de-
vice embolization, and 0.2% had an esophageal tear.16 The PREVAIL 
model assumed that in the periprocedural period after LAA closure, 
0.4% of patients had a serious pericardial effusion, 0.7% of patients 
had an ischemic stroke, 0.7% of patients had a device embolization, 
and 0.2% had an esophageal tear.17
Ischemic Stroke
In the PROTECT AF base case, the annual rate of ischemic stroke was 
1.1% per year for warfarin, and the relative risk for ischemic stroke with 
dabigatran was 0.76 compared with warfarin.4,5,16,18,30 In the PREV
AIL 
base case, the annual rate of ischemic stroke was 0.7% per year for war-
farin.17 For LAA closure, the long-term annual rate of ischemic stroke 
(excluding periprocedural events) was 1.4% per year in PROTECT AF 
and 1.9% per year in PREVAIL (Table 1).17,18,30 In the base case, we 
assumed that ischemic strokes after LAA closure resulted in discontinu-
ation of aspirin therapy and replacement with warfarin.
Intracranial Hemorrhage
For the base case, the annual rate of ICH was 1.1% per year in 
PROTECT AF and 0% in PREVAIL on warfarin.17,18,30 The relative 
risk for ICH on dabigatran was 0.26 compared with warfarin (0.4% 
Figure 1. Decision model. The schematic at the top represents the treatment arms: warfarin, dabigatran, and percutaneous closure of the 
left atrial appendage (LAA). M represents a Markov process with 10 health states for each of the treatment options. These potential health 
states (and transitions) are identical for each of the treatment options. All patients remain in the Well state until one of the 5 events occur: 
transient ischemic attack (TIA), stroke, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, extracranial hemorrhage, 
or death. The probabilities of these events depend on the prescribed therapy. The triangles on the right indicate which health state the 
patient enters after an event. Reversible ischemic neurological event (RIND) is the health state that patients enter after a TIA or a stroke 
without residual deficit. Mild represents a neurological event that results in a neurological deficit but no limitation performing activities of 
daily living, whereas Moderate to Severe represents a neurological event that results in loss of independence for at least 1 activity of daily 
living. This figure does not show the perioperative events associated with the LAA closure, but these events occur before the Markov 
nodes and are enumerated in Table 1 under the section Periprocedural adverse events, LAA closure.

per year), based on RE-LY.4,5,16 The rate of ICH after LAA closure was 
0.2% per year in PROTECT AF and 0.4% per year in PREVAIL.17,18,30
Stroke and Hemorrhage Severity
We classified initial ischemic stroke into 4 categories: fatal, moderate-
to-severe neurological sequelae, mild neurological sequelae, and no 
residual neurological deficit.3,29,33–41 We assumed that a second mild 
ischemic stroke resulted in a moderate-to-severe ischemic stroke. We 
classified hemorrhage into 4 categories: fatal, ICH with moderate-to-
severe neurological sequelae, ICH with mild neurological sequelae, 
and nonfatal extracerebral major hemorrhage.4,31,37,42–47
Quality-of-Life Estimates
We calculated quality-adjusted survival by multiplying the prob-
abilities of adverse events by quality-of-life estimates (utilities).48 We 
adjusted baseline quality of life for age.49 We obtained the utility for 
warfarin without complications from published data on patients with 
AF that were based on patient ratings of their quality of life while re-
ceiving warfarin, including prothrombin time monitoring and chang-
es in diet or lifestyle. The mean utility was 0.987 for warfarin29,48 and 
0.998 for aspirin.29,48
We estimated the utility for dabigatran as 0.994 as in previous 
studies,22 which was derived from a survey of anticoagulation physi-
cians for an older direct thrombin inhibitor, ximelagatran.4,5,29
We accounted for the temporary decrease in quality of life as-
sociated with the LAA closure procedure by reducing quality of life 
by 30% for 10 days. After 10 days, patients were assigned the util-
ity for warfarin while on that medication and the utility for aspirin 
thereafter.48
Any ischemic or hemorrhagic neurological event with residual 
deficit, MI, and systemic embolism were associated with permanent 
decreases in quality of life. We assigned temporary decrements in qual-
ity of life (utility) for ischemic stroke with no residual neurological 
deficit, transient ischemic attack, nonfatal extracerebral major hemor-
rhage, pericardial effusion, esophageal tear, and device embolization.
Costs
Costs, expressed in 2014 US Dollars, reflected the perspective of an 
ideal insurer that covered inpatient and outpatient medical care and 
prescription costs. For each treatment, we projected costs >35 years; 
future costs and life years were discounted at 3% per year. We in-
cluded age-adjusted average healthcare expenditures for each patient 
and then added the costs associated with the 3 treatment strategies.65 
This analysis excluded indirect costs.
Drug Treatment Costs
We estimated medication costs for warfarin, dabigatran, and aspirin 
based on the median consumer prices in the United States.53,66 For 
warfarin anticoagulation, we combined the annual medication cost 
with the cost for 14 international normalized ratio tests and the Center 
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reimbursement for a pe-
riod of 90 days of anticoagulation management (Current Procedural 
Terminology code 99364). In sensitivity analyses, we allowed for pa-
tients initiating warfarin to have ≤8 additional international normal-

LAA Closure Costs
The Watchman device was recently approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration, and the CMS made a final determination to cover 
LAA closure on February 8, 2016 under diagnosis-related group 
(DRG) 273 (percutaneous intracardiac procedure with major com-
plication or comorbidity) at a rate of $20 961 and DRG 274 (per-
cutaneous intracardiac procedure without major complication or 
comorbidity) at a rate of $14 288. Because the device is only indi-
cated in patients with AF and a CHADS2 score ≥2 or a CHA2DS2-
VASc score ≥3, we estimated that the great majority of procedures 
will be reimbursed at the higher rate. We also included the cost of 
1 transesophageal echocardiogram at the time of the procedure and 
physician fee reimbursement, for a total cost of $24 010.55,68
Ancillary costs of imaging and clinical follow-up were modeled 
according to the PROTECT AF trial protocol, including transesopha-
geal echocardiography at 45 days, 6 months, and 12 months after 
implantation and 4 established care outpatient physician visits.16
Adverse Event Costs
We estimated the one-time costs of ischemic stroke, transient isch-
emic attack, ICH, and MI based on the costs of a hospitalization 
for the DRG or the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision code published by the Agency for Healthcare Research and 
Quality (AHRQ) HCUPnet.55 We estimated monthly costs of care for 
each of these complications based on previously published cost es-
timates using CMS reimbursement for the DRG, adjusted to 2014 
US dollars using the gross domestic product deflator.29,56–58,62,69–71 We 
estimated the one-time cost of a major extracranial hemorrhage based 
on the hospital cost for the International Classification of Diseases, 
Ninth Revision codes associated with gastrointestinal hemorrhage 
(530.21, 578.1, 578.9, and 772.4) published by AHRQ HCUPnet. 
We estimated the acute care costs of systemic embolization based on 
costs for the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision 
code 444.09 (Other arterial embolism and thrombosis of abdominal 
aorta). We estimated monthly costs of care for patients after systemic 
embolization based on previously published cost estimates using 
CMS reimbursement for the DRG, adjusted to 2014 US Dollars using 
the gross domestic product deflator.28,54–60 We estimated the one-time 
costs of a serious pericardial effusion based on the hospital costs for 
the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes 
423.0 and 423.3 published by AHRQ HCUPnet. We estimated the 
one-time costs of an esophageal tear using the hospital cost for DRG 
368 (major esophageal disorder) published by AHRQ HCUPnet.

events were derived from 95% confidence intervals for event rates 
from the PROTECT AF, PREVAIL, and RE-LY trials, as well as other 
published literature.4,16,17,24,30 When 95% confidence intervals were not 
published, a Poisson distribution was assumed to calculate the confi-
dence interval. Medication costs for aspirin, warfarin, and dabigatran 
included the range of discount and retail costs.53
We conducted a sensitivity analysis in which we varied the base-
line risk of ischemic stroke or ICH for all 3 treatment strategies by 
the same ratio to simulate the cost-effectiveness ratios for patients at 
varying risk for these adverse events (eg, low to high CHADS2).
Because procedural success and safety can be considerably worse 
with inexperienced operators outside of clinical trials, we also con-
ducted a sensitivity analysis in which we decreased the rate of suc-
cessful device implantation and increased the rates of each of the 
periprocedural adverse events from those reported in PROTECT AF 
and assessed how this impacted the cost effectiveness of the device.
Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis takes into account all sources of un-
certainty in the data inputs and generates a best estimate of which 
therapy is preferred at different cost-effectiveness thresholds. We 
performed second-order Monte Carlo simulations,22,72 randomly 
sampling (with replacement) a distribution of all variables 10 000 
times and then simulating outcomes. For event rates, we generally 
used a normal distribution, except for the mutually exclusive sub-
categorization of stroke, for which we used a Dirichlet distribution. 
We used a beta distribution for utilities and a gamma distribution 
for costs.
Results
Base Case Analyses
Under base case conditions with mean 3.8-year follow-up data 
from PROTECT AF, the quality-adjusted life expectancy was 
7.96 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with warfarin, 8.28 
QALYs with dabigatran, and 9.94 QALYs with LAA closure 
(Table 2; Figure I in the Data Supplement). Total costs were 
$92 190 for warfarin, $94 072 for dabigatran, and $132 844 
for LAA closure. Comparing LAA closure with warfarin, 
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $20 486 
per QALY, and comparing LAA closure with dabigatran, 
the ICER was $23 422 per QALY. In a base case cohort of 
10 000 patients followed over their lifetime, LAA closure was 
associated with an ischemic stroke rate lower than warfarin 
and similar to that of dabigatran, and it was associated with 
a markedly lower rate of ICH compared with both anticoagu-
lants (Table 3). LAA closure and dabigatran were also associ-
ated with higher rates of MI than warfarin.
Using data from PREVAIL for the base case data inputs, 
the quality-adjusted life expectancy was 8.54 QALYs with 
warfarin, 8.59 QALYs with dabigatran, and 8.44 QALYs with 
LAA closure (Table 2; Figure II in the Data Supplement). 
Total costs were $73 077 for warfarin, $83 746 for dabigatran, 
and $120 977 for LAA closure. LAA closure was dominated 
by both warfarin and dabigatran, meaning that it was both less 
effective (lower QALYs) and more costly than both medical 
alternatives. In a base case cohort of 10 000 patients followed 
over their lifetime, LAA closure was associated with an isch-
emic stroke rate similar to warfarin and higher than dabigatran 
and a markedly higher rate of ICH (Table 3).
Sensitivity Analyses
One-way sensitivity analyses for the comparison of LAA clo-
sure to warfarin showed that the cost effectiveness of LAA 
closure was most sensitive to changes in the rates of stroke 
and ICH (Figures III and IV in the Data Supplement). The 
model was also sensitive to the cost of the Watchman, the 
utility with warfarin, the cost of stroke, the rate of systemic 
embolism, the cost of ICH, and the rate of MI, and the utility 
associated with major adverse events (stroke, ICH, and MI). 
Using the PROTECT AF data inputs, the cost-effectiveness 
estimates were only moderately sensitive to these parameters, 
and the ICER for LAA closure compared with both medical 
therapies remained below $35 000 per QALY for all values of 
each variable tested. Using PREVAIL data inputs, the cost-
effectiveness estimates were insensitive to these parameters, 
and the ICER for LAA closure compared with both medical 
therapies remained above $100 000 per QALY for all value 
ranges of each variable tested.
Ischemic Stroke
The cost effectiveness of LAA closure could be sensitive to 
changes in ischemic stroke rates for patients with LAA closure.

from the trial showed that the ICER of LAA closure remained 
below $50 000 per QALY in comparison to both warfarin 
and dabigatran (Figure 2). Using data from PREVAIL, if the 
long-term rate of stroke with LAA closure dropped below 0.6 
strokes per 100 person-years, LAA closure would no longer 
be dominated, but the ICER of LAA closure would remain 
above $100 000 per QALY even if the long-term stroke rate 
dropped as low as 0.2 per 100 person-years (Figure 3).
Intracranial Hemorrhage
The cost effectiveness of LAA closure could be sensitive to 
changes in ICH rates for patients with LAA closure (Figures V 
and VI in the Data Supplement). Using data from PROTECT 
AF, 1-way sensitivity analysis on the rate of ICH after LAA 
closure over the plausible range from the trial showed that the 
ICER of LAA closure remained below $30 000 per QALY 
in comparison to both warfarin and dabigatran. Using data 
from PREVAIL, if the rate of ICH with LAA closure dropped 
below 0.1% ICHs per 100 person-years, LAA closure would 
no longer be dominated but the ICER would remain above 
$500 000 per QALY for both warfarin and dabigatran.
Periprocedural Adverse Events and Less 
Experienced Operator Sensitivity Analysis
One-way sensitivity analyses showed that the model was 
insensitive (incremental cost effectiveness varied by <$1000 
per QALY) to each of the periprocedural adverse events, 
including pericardial effusion, ischemic stroke, device embo-
lization, and esophageal tear.
To test the possible effect of less experienced operators 
performing LAA closure, we decreased the rate of success-
ful device implantation to 80% and increased each of the 
periprocedural adverse event rates to the highest value in 
their plausible ranges. For this scenario, using data from 
PROTECT AF, the ICER for LAA closure was $29 090 per 
QALY compared with warfarin and $35 360 per QALY com-
pared with dabigatran. For this scenario, using data from 
PREVAIL, LAA closure remained dominated compared 
with warfarin and dabigatran, meaning that it was both less 
effective (lower QALYs) and more costly than both medical 
alternatives.
Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis
In the Monte Carlo simulation, varying all data inputs 
simultaneously based on data from PROTECT AF, warfarin 
was most likely to be cost effective at a willingness-to-pay 
threshold <$6000 per QALY, dabigatran was most likely to 
be cost effective between $6000 and $21 000 per QALY, and 
LAA closure was most likely to be cost effective above that. 
LAA closure was 89% and 98% likely to be cost effective 
at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50 000 and $100 000, 
respectively (Figure 4). Using data from PREVAIL, warfa-
rin was most likely to be cost effective at all willingness-to-
pay thresholds. Percutaneous closure of the LAA was 9% 
and 14% likely to be cost effective at willingness-to-pay 
thresholds of $50 000 and $100 000 per QALY, respectively 
(Figure 5). We generated scatter plots including all the val-
ues from these simulations for both trials, which showed 
relatively modest variability around our base case estimates 
of cost and quality-adjusted survival (Figures VII and VIII 
in the Data Supplement).

Discussion
We found that in patients aged 70 years with AF at an increased 
risk of stroke (CHADS2 score ≥1), compared with oral antico-
agulation, the quality-adjusted survival and cost effectiveness 
of LAA closure with the Watchman device varied consider-
ably based on which clinical trial was used for the base case 
data inputs and assumptions. Using long-term follow-up 
(mean: 3.8 years) data inputs from PROTECT AF, the ICER of 
LAA closure compared with warfarin was $20 486 per QALY. 
However, using the 18-month follow-up data inputs from 
PREVAIL, LAA closure had lower quality-adjusted survival 
and was more costly (dominated in cost-effectiveness terms). 
At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000 per QALY, LAA 
closure was cost effective 89% of the time under PROTECT 
AF assumptions and 9% of the time under PREVAIL assump-
tions. These results were sensitive to the rates of ischemic 
stroke and ICH for LAA closure and medical anticoagulation, 
and it was the marked variation in these rates across the tri-
als that accounted for most of the variation in the effective-
ness (quality-adjusted survival) and cost effectiveness of the 
different treatment modalities. These findings indicate that 
the cost effectiveness of LAA closure will critically depend 
on whether rates of adverse events such as stroke and ICH 
in typical clinical practice mirror those of the clinical trials 
and demonstrate the critical need for systematic postmarket 
surveillance of LAA closure.
Our results using longer-term follow-up data from 
PROTECT AF extend the results of a previous cost-effective-
ness analysis using 18-month follow-up data from PROTECT 
AF and modeled in the Canadian healthcare system.19 That 
study showed an ICER of $41 565 per QALY for LAA closure 
compared with warfarin. During the 3.8-year follow-up of the 
PROTECT AF study, the rates of ischemic stroke and bleed-
ing were very favorable for LAA closure relative to medical 
anticoagulation, leading to better quality-adjusted survival 
and cost effectiveness. The rate of ICH with LAA closure in 
particular was dramatically lower than with medical antico-
agulation. During the extended time frame of our base case 
model, the cumulative effect of ongoing higher relative risk 
of major adverse events, particularly bleeding, with medical 
anticoagulation outweighed the early risk of periprocedural 
adverse events with LAA closure, resulting in a low ICER of 
$20 486 per QALY compared with warfarin.
In contrast, during the 18-month follow-up of the 
PREVAIL study, LAA closure was associated with simi-
lar or higher rates of ischemic stroke compared with medi-
cal anticoagulation and higher rates of ICH, leading to lower 
quality-adjusted survival and poor cost effectiveness. This 
was driven, in large part, by the substantially lower risk of 
stroke and ICH in the warfarin arm of PREVAIL. Importantly, 
these adverse event rates for warfarin were markedly lower 
than that in PROTECT AF and in the control arms of several 
recent studies evaluating the novel anticoagulants (Table I in 
the Data Supplement).4,6–8 In addition, if the trends in long-
term bleeding rates are consistent with PROTECT AF (lower 
in the device arm off anticoagulation), the extended follow-up 
results from PREVAIL may show an ongoing accrual of major 
bleeding events with medical anticoagulation that would 
improve the quality-adjusted survival and cost effectiveness 
of LAA closure over time.
Our cost-effectiveness estimates for PROTECT AF and 
PREVAIL were disparate because the studies were small, lim-
iting the statistical precision of their findings and causing sub-
stantial variation in adverse event rates. As such, we think that 
our results for the 2 studies likely represent the range of pos-
sible cost-effectiveness estimates. However, given the larger 
patient experience of the PROTECT AF trial (707 patients 
compared with 407 in PREVAIL) and the much longer 3.8-
year average follow-up time (compared with 18 months in 
PREVAIL), our estimates from PROTECT AF have less sta-
tistical uncertainty. In addition, a recently published study 
which included pooled data from the 4-year PROTECT AF 
follow-up, PREVAIL, and the 2 Continued Access Protocol 
registries showed that the major adverse event rates for the 
Continued Access Protocol registries (enrolling a combined 
1145 patients) were consistent with those of the long-term 
Figure 3. One-way sensitivity analysis show-
ing the effect of varying the long-term ischemic 
stroke rate of percutaneous closure of the left 
atrial appendage (LAA) on the incremental cost 
effectiveness of LAA closure compared with war-
farin and dabigatran in PREVAIL. If the long-term 
rate of stroke with LAA closure dropped below 
0.6 strokes per 100 person-years, LAA closure 
would no longer be dominated, but the incremen-
tal cost-effectiveness ratio of LAA closure would 
remain above $100 
000 per quality-adjusted life 
year across the range of stroke rates. The vertical 
dotted line shows the base case. PREVAIL indi-

PROTECT AF study, which corroborates those findings.73 
Finally, as noted above, the adverse event rates for warfarin in 
PROTECT AF were much more consistent with those in the 
control arms of several recent studies evaluating the target-
specific anticoagulants (Table I in the Data Supplement).4,6–8
Notably, periprocedural complications did not substantially 
influence the effectiveness or cost effectiveness of LAA closure 
in our study. Although periprocedural complications were more 
common in PROTECT AF than in PREVAIL, our analyses dem-
onstrated that the model was relatively insensitive to changes in 
the risk of these events. These procedural complications occur 
acutely, and over time, their influence on quality-adjusted sur-
vival and cost effectiveness is overwhelmed by the effects of 
highly morbid and costly adverse events, such as stroke and 
ICH. Similarly, in a sensitivity analysis to simulate inexperi-
enced operators in which we decreased the rate of successful 
LAA closure device implantation to 80% and increased each 
of the periprocedural adverse event rates to the highest value in 
their plausible ranges, we found that the quality-adjusted sur-
vival and cost effectiveness was only moderately affected.
For our study, several caveats should be considered. 
First, comparison of LAA closure to dabigatran is an indirect 
one because they have not been studied in any head-to-head 
trials. However, secondary analyses from RE-LY demon-
strated that the effectiveness of dabigatran seemed consistent 
across many strata of patients, suggesting that it is reason-
able to assume consistent effectiveness in a comparison with 
the population from the Watchman trials.4,5,74 Second, cost 
effectiveness may vary across the novel anticoagulants, but 
meta-analysis has demonstrated that major adverse event 
rates, including ischemic stroke, ICH, and death, are similar 
across the target-specific anticoagulants. Third, the base case 
inputs used from PROTECT AF and PREVAIL had differ-
ent follow-up times, and extended follow-up could lead to 
significant differences in long-term event rates. In the index 
PROTECT AF publication with a mean follow-up of 18 
months, LAA closure was noninferior to warfarin,16 whereas 
after a mean follow-up of almost 4 years, LAA closure was 
superior across several primary and secondary end points.18 
Because PREVAIL has reported only 18-month follow-up 
to date,17 there may be greater uncertainty with PREVAIL-
based estimates until longer-term data are reported. Fourth, 
clinical safety and effectiveness may depend on several fac-
tors not captured in these trials, including patient selection, 
operator or site factors, and concomitant use and duration of 
anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy after LAA occlusion. 
If safety or effectiveness is different outside of the clinical 
trial setting, this could substantially affect value.75 Finally, 
our study findings only apply to patients who are eligible 
for anticoagulation because patients with contraindications

to anticoagulation were excluded from both PROTECT AF 
and PREVAIL.
In conclusion, we found that the quality-adjusted survival 
and cost effectiveness of LAA closure with the Watchman 
device varies substantially depending on whether the clinical 
event rates reflect those of the PROTECT AF or PREVAIL 
clinical trials. The cost effectiveness of LAA closure using 
PROTECT AF data was in a range generally considered to be 
cost effective. Using data from PREVAIL, however, LAA clo-
sure was dominated by warfarin and dabigatran, meaning that 
it was less effective and more costly. PROTECT AF enrolled 
more patients and has substantially longer follow-up time, 
allowing greater statistical certainty with the cost-effectiveness 
results. Longer-term trial results and postmarketing surveillance 
of major adverse events will be vital to determining the ultimate 
value of this novel treatment modality in clinical practice.
