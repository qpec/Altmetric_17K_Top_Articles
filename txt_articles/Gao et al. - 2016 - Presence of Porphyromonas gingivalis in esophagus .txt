Abstract
Background: Mounting evidence suggests a causal relationship between specific bacterial infections and the
development of certain malignancies. However, the possible role of the keystone periodontal pathogen,
Porphyromonas gingivalis, in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains unknown. Therefore, we
examined the presence of P. gingivalis in esophageal mucosa, and the relationship between P. gingivalis
infection and the diagnosis and prognosis of ESCC.
Methods: The presence of P. gingivalis in the esophageal tissues from ESCC patients and normal controls was
examined by immunohistochemistry using antibodies targeting whole bacteria and its unique secreted protease, the
gingipain Kgp. qRT-PCR was used as a confirmatory approach to detect P. gingivalis 16S rDNA. Clinicopathologic
characteristics were collected to analyze the relationship between P. gingivalis infection and development of
ESCC.
Results: P. gingivalis was detected immunohistochemically in 61 % of cancerous tissues, 12 % of adjacent tissues
and was undetected in normal esophageal mucosa. A similar distribution of lysine-specific gingipain, a catalytic
endoprotease uniquely secreted by P. gingivalis, and P. gingivalis 16S rDNA was also observed. Moreover, statistic
correlations showed P. gingivalis infection was positively associated with multiple clinicopathologic characteristics,
including differentiation status, metastasis, and overall survival rate.
Conclusion: These findings demonstrate for the first time that P. gingivalis infects the epithelium of the esophagus of
ESCC patients, establish an association between infection with P. gingivalis and the progression of ESCC, and
suggest P. gingivalis infection could be a biomarker for this disease. More importantly, these data, if confirmed, indicate
that eradication of a common oral pathogen could potentially contribute to a reduction in the overall ESCC burden.

 Background
Since the discovery that Helicobacter pylori plays a causa-
tive role in gastric adenocarcinoma, multiple other associ-
ations between specific bacteria and cancer have been
reported [1, 2], including Salmonella typhi with gall
bladder cancer [3], Streptococcus bovis with colon cancer
[4], Chlamydophila penumoniae with lung cancer [5],
Bartonella species with vascular tumor formation [6],
Propionibacterium acnes with prostate cancer [7], and
Escherichia coli with colon cancer [8]. Esophageal cancer
is the eighth most frequent tumor and sixth leading cause
of cancer death worldwide. Whereas the majority of cases
occur in Asia, particularly in central China, recent data
suggest that the frequency of new cases is rising in
Western Europe and the USA [9, 10]. Two major histo-
logical subtypes of esophageal cancer have been identified
including squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), which is
more common in developing countries, and adenocarcin-
oma, which is more common in developed nations [11].
Esophageal cancer is characterized by difficulty of early
diagnosis, rapid development and high mortality. There-
fore, there is a considerable need to better understand
causative agents in order to reduce the incidence and
mortality of this disease. Like most cancers, a plethora of
risk factors including age, gender, heredity, gene mutation,
chemical exposure, and diet have been reported for
esophageal cancer [12, 13].
A potential contribution of microbes to the develop-
ment of esophageal cancer is beginning to emerge. Pei et
al. reported that Streptococcus, Prevotella and Veillonella
are the most prevalent genera detected in esophageal bi-
opsies [14, 15]. Yang et al. have classified the esophageal
microbiota into two subtypes: the Streptococcus-domi-
nated type I microbiome, which is mainly associated with
a normal esophagus, and the type II microbiome, in which
Gram-negative anaerobes predominate, which is associ-
ated with Barrett’s esophagus (BE) and esophagitis [16]. A
significant association between the inhabitants of the
upper digestive tract microbiota and esophageal squamous
dysplasia, a precursor lesion of esophageal squamous cell
carcinoma, has also been reported [17]. While there are
several phylum-wide studies on the esophageal microbiota
and the possible associations with reflux esophagitis,
Barrett’s esophagus, and esophageal squamous dysplasia,
there has been no research on the esophageal microbiota
in patients suffering from ESCC, especially at species level,
let alone the possible association of these bacteria with the
development of ESCC.
The microbiome in chronic and severe manifestations
of periodontal disease is enriched for Gram-negative an-
aerobic bacteria. Among these, Porphyromonas gingivalis
is a keystone oral pathogen which can invade epithelial
cells, and interfere with host immune responses and the
cell cycle machinery [18–20]. Epidemiological studies
have demonstrated that periodontal diseases and tooth
loss are significantly associated several cancers such as
oral cancer, gastric cancer, and pancreatic cancer and
may even relate to survival [20–24]. P. gingivalis-medi-
ated immune evasion, apoptosis inhibition, carcinogen
conversion, induction of MMP-9 and dysbiosis of the
oral microbiota have all been posited as pro-tumorigenic
mechanisms in the context of oral squamous cell carcin-
oma [20, 25]. Since esophageal squamous cells are histo-
logically similar to oral squamous cells and esophageal
infection arising from the oral niche is highly plausible,
we hypothesized that P. gingivalis may be associated
with ESCC. We set out to test this hypothesis using 100
ESCC subjects and 30 normal matched controls.
Results
Immunohistochemical detection of P. gingivalis presence
is more common in ESCC
As shown in Fig. 1, P. gingivalis was detected in cancer-
ous and adjacent esophageal mucosa, but not healthy
mucosa. Furthermore, P. gingivalis infection was more
common in cancerous tissue (61 %) than adjacent tissue
(12 %) or normal control tissue (0 %) (both p < 0.01,
Table 1). P. gingivalis was primarily immunolocalized to
the epithelial cell cytoplasm but bacterial antigens were
occasionally present in nuclei.
Expression of P. gingivalis lysine-gingipain (Kgp) is more
common in ESCC
To corroborate the presence of P. gingivalis antigens in
esophageal epithelium, we next used a Kgp-specific anti-
body. As shown in Fig. 2, the expression pattern of Kgp
reflected that of the whole cell antigens as above, being
primarily expressed in the epithelial cytoplasm but occa-
sionally in nuclei, and expressed at significantly high levels
in cancerous tissue (66 %), as compared with adjacent
(17 %) or healthy tissues (0 %) (both p < 0.01, Table 1).
P. gingivalis 16S rDNA is more frequent in ESCC
To control for false positives due to possible cross-
reaction of antibodies, we next employed qRT-PCR to
examine the presence of 16S rDNA in fresh esopha-
geal tissue specimens. All esophageal samples were
positive for the presence of bacteria, as determined
using universal 16S rDNA primers (Additional file 1:
Figure S1). Similar to the staining pattern with anti-
bodies to the whole cells and to Kgp, P. gingivalis
16S rDNA was present in significantly more frequently in
the cancerous tissues (71 %) than adjacent (12 %) or
normal esophagus mucosa (3.3 %; both p < 0.001), as
presented in Table 2.

 Comparison of different methods for the detection of P.
gingivalis presence
We next analyzed the correlation between the expres-
sion of P. gingivalis whole antigens and Kgp, and the
concordance between the results of immunohistochem-
istry (IHC) and real time qPCR. Of the 100 esophageal
cancerous tissue specimens that were analyzed in this
study, 59 % of samples were positive for immunohisto-
chemical staining for both P. gingivalis cells and Kgp
enzyme (Table 3). The level of P. gingivalis whole cell
staining was found to significantly correlate with the level
of the Kgp staining in cancerous tissue of ESCC patients
(p <0.0001; Pearson’s contingency coefficient = 0.630).
Moreover, we compared the results of IHC and qRT-
PCR for the presence of P. gingivalis to determine
the agreement between these two different methods.
The data showed that the average percentage of can-
cerous tissues positively stained with anti-P. gingivalis
antibody in the qRT-PCR positive tumors was signifi-
cantly higher than in the qRT-PCR negative tumors
(84.5 % versus 3.4 %; p <0.0001). There was only one
case with IHC scores of 2 that was qRT-PCR nega-
tive. However, we found eleven cases with IHC scores
of lower than 2 that were qRT-PCR positive (Table 4),
suggesting our IHC standard is higher and qRT-PCR
is more sensitive for the detection of P. gingivalis in
cancerous tissue. In current study, IHC scores with
whole P. gingivalis antigen equal or more than 2 were
P. gingivalis-positive. The sensitivity and specificity of
IHC were 84.5 and 96.6 %, respectively. The concord-
ance rate was 88 % (kappa = 0.736; p < 0.001) between
IHC and qRT-PCR (Table 4). When we re-examined
the eleven cases which were IHC negative and qRT-
PCR positive, we found 7 of them staining with an
IHC score close to 2, suggesting the positive criteria
of IHC is critical for the agreement of these two
methods. If we set the samples with IHC scores more
than 1 as P. gingivalis positive, the sensitivity and specifi-
city of IHC would be 94.3 and 96.6 %, respectively
(Kappa = 0.882; p < 0.001, Additional file 2: Table S1),

qRT-PCR for the detection of P. gingivalis infection
in the cancerous tissues of ESCC patients.
P. gingivalis infection is positively correlated to
clinicopathologic characteristics of ESCC
Since an association between P. gingivalis infection and
ESCC had been demonstrated, we next sought to deter-
mine if the presence of P. gingivalis antigens is associated
with the progression of esophageal cancer. Pathological in-
formation of the ESCC patients is presented in Table 5.
While the presence of P. gingivalis was not significantly
associated with age, gender, or smoking history of the pa-
tients, the presence of P. gingivalis was positively related
to differentiation, lymph node metastasis and the TNM
stage of ESCC (p < 0.05). A positive immunohistochemical
signal for P. gingivalis was 90 % in the poorly differenti-
ated tissues, which was significantly higher than that of
well or moderately differentiated samples (p < 0.05)
(Table 5). Moreover, the percentage of P. gingivalis in-
fected lymph node metastasis samples was 84.2 %, sta-
tistically higher than that of non-metastatic group
(46.8 %; p < 0.05) (Table 5). Similar relationships be-
tween P. gingivalis-derived Kgp expression, cancer cell
differentiation and metastasis were observed (Table 5).
Additionally, the presence of P. gingivalis was closely

 related to the TNM stage of ESCC. Late stage ESCC
tissues were more likely to be positive for whole P. gingi-
valis-derived antigens (87.5 %) or Kgp (84.4 %) than early
stage ESCC (48.5 and 57.4 %, respectively; p < 0.05).
Taken together, these results reveal that P. gingivalis
infection is positively correlated with poor differenti-
ation, severe lymph node metastasis and stage of ESCC,
suggesting that P. gingivalis could be a novel etiologic
agent and potential prognostic indicator of this import-
ant malignant disease.
P. gingivalis infection is negatively correlated with overall
ESCC survive rate
In order to assess the potential consequences of P. gingi-
valis infection on ESCC patients, we next compared the
overall cumulative survival rate in ESCC patients with
and without P. gingivalis infection. A total of 100 pa-
tients were followed up for survival analysis over a
period of 30 months (Table 6). Because of the limited
follow-up time, the survival rate of both groups was
greater than 40 % and the median survival time could
not be calculated. However, the mean survival time for
patients with positive P. gingivalis antigen expression
was 20.139 months, significantly lower than that of P.
gingivalis negative group (25.971 months) or all patients
(23.981 months) (both p < 0.05) (Table 6). Similar results
were found when Lys- gingipain expression were exam-
ined, with mean survival times of 22.475, 27.078, and
23.981 months for positive, negative and all patients
group, respectively (6). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier ana-
lysis showed that the difference between negative and
positive P. gingivalis presence was significant for overall
survival both for P. gingivalis positive staining (n = 100,
p = 0.036) (Fig. 3a) and Kgp positive expression (n = 100,
p = 0.048) (Fig. 3b).
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, the composition and po-
tential role of the esophageal microbiota in the patients
suffering from ESCC have not been investigated. Using
three complementary approaches, we have established
that antigens and DNA from P. gingivalis, a periodontal
pathogen, can be detected in the epithelium of the
esophagus of ESCC patients. The intensity of expression
of whole P. gingivalis antigen, its unique protease Lys-
gingipain, and detection of P. gingivalis-specific16S
rDNA were all significantly higher in the cancerous
tissue of ESCC patients than in the surrounding tissue
or normal control sites. Moreover, our analysis indi-
cates that the presence of P. gingivalis correlates with
multiple clinicopathologic factors, including cancer cell
differentiation, metastasis, and overall survival ESCC
rate. These findings provide the first direct evidence
that P. gingivalis infection could be a novel risk factor
for ESCC, and may also serve as a prognostic bio-
marker for this prevalent cancer.
A number of aspects of the interaction of P. gingivalis
with host epithelial cells provide a plausible molecular
basis for potential P. gingivalis-mediated carcinogenesis
[20, 25, 26]. First, chronic inflammation per se is associ-
ated with the development of cancer [27], and, for
example, prolonged IL-6 signaling and STAT3 activity is
known to be pro-tumorogenic [28, 29]. In this regard,
both our group and others have demonstrated that P. gin-
givalis
activates
JAK2
and
GSK3β
pathways,
thus

 increasing the production of IL-6 in epithelial cells
[28, 30]. Secondly, P. gingivalis can promote tumori-
genesis by secreting a nucleoside diphosphate kinase
(NDK). NDK from P. gingivalis antagonizes ATP acti-
vation of P2X7 receptors, and thus reduces IL-1β pro-
duction
from
epithelial
cells
[31].
Since
IL-1β
is
critical for priming IFNγ-producing, tumor–antigen-
specific CD8+ T cells, NDK from P. gingivalis could
promote the immune evasion of tumor cells [20].
Moreover, NDK-mediated degradation of ATP also
suppresses apoptosis dependent on ATP activation of
P2X7 receptors [32]. Thirdly, P. gingivalis inhibits epi-
thelial cell apoptosis by a number of mechanisms,
including activation of Jak1/Akt/Stat3 [33, 34], enhan-
cing the Bcl2 (antiapoptotic): Bax (proapoptotic) ratio,
blocking the release of the apoptosis effector cyto-
chrome c, and the activation of downstream caspases
[35]. Moreover, P. gingivalis can upregulate micro-
RNAs, such as miR-203, which suppress apoptosis in
primary gingival epithelial cells [36]. In concert with
suppression of apoptosis, P. gingivalis can accelerate
progression through the cell cycle by manipulation of
cyclin/CDK (cyclin-dependent kinase) activity and re-
ducing the level of the p53 tumor suppressor [37].
Lastly, in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells,
P.
gingivalis
promotes
cellular
migration
through
activation of the ERK1/2-Ets1, p38/HSP27, and PAR2/
NF-κB pathways to induce pro-matrix metalloprotein-
ase (MMP)-9 expression [25]. Apart from all the
above, another possible mechanism for P. gingivalis
induced carcinogenesis is the metabolism of poten-
tially carcinogenic substances. For example, P. gingi-
valis converts ethanol into its carcinogenic derivative,
acetaldehyde, to levels capable of inducing DNA damage,
mutagenesis and hyperproliferation of the epithelium
[38, 39], which could help explain the epidemiological
evidence associating heavy drinking and development
of some cancers [20].
While it is possible that P. gingivalis infection initiates
or is a co-factor in the transformation of esophageal

 epithelial cells, the possibility that cancer tissues repre-
sent a preferred microenvironment for P. gingivalis can-
not be excluded. Thus, while our results reveal a positive
association between infection with P. gingivalis and the
progression of ESCC, P. gingivalis is not yet established
as a novel etiological agent or co-factor of ESCC. Should
P. gingivalis prove to cause ESCC, the implications are
enormous. It would suggest (i) that improved oral
hygiene might reduce ESCC risk, (ii) that screening for
P. gingivalis in dental plaque may identify susceptible
subjects, and that (iii) antibiotic use, or other anti-
bacterial
strategies,
may
prevent
ESCC
progression.
Should
the
clear
association
between
P.
gingivalis
infection and ESCC turn out to be better explained by
physiological conditions inside ESCC cells being more
amenable to P. gingivalis survival and growth, this would
imply that attenuated P. gingivalis or non-pathogenic
bacteroidetes strains that contain eukaryotic lysins may
represent a novel and effective therapeutic approach for
ESCC. In this regard, several studies have attempted to
take advantage of the oxygen-limited conditions present
in malignant cells to develop anaerobic, non-pathogenic
bacteria for the delivery of cancer cell cytolysins [40].
These include Clostridium novyi for the treatment of
melanoma and modified Bifidobacterium longum car-
rying 5-fluorocytosine for the treatment of breast cancer
[41–43]. Hence, further studies to determine if P. gingiva-
lis infection promotes the initiation and progression of
ESCC are required.
Finally, colonization by P. gingivalis promotes the con-
version of a symbiotic to a dysbiotic of oral microbiota,
a process considered critical for the progression of peri-
odontal disease [44]. Dysbiosis of the microbiota in the
esophagus could potentially cause or exacerbate the
severity of esophageal disorders [18]. Thus, a further
possibility to be tested is that esophageal infection with
P. gingivalis leads to shift in the microbiome involved in
the development of esophageal cancer.
Conclusion
In summary, we have established that P. gingivalis mole-
cules are present in the epithelium of the esophagus of
ESCC patients and provide the first direct evidence of a
positive correlation between P. gingivalis infection, ESCC
severity and poor prognosis. These findings demonstrate
for the first time that P. gingivalis infects the epithelium of
the esophagus of ESCC patients, establish the association
between the infection of P. gingivalis and the progression
of ESCC, and suggest P. gingivalis infection could be a
biomarker for this disease. More importantly, these data,
if confirmed, indicate that eradication of an oral pathogen
could potentially contribute to a reduction in the overall
ESCC burden.
Methods
The study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the University of Henan University of Science
and Technology (HUST).
Patients and human tissue
One hundred patients with ESCC who underwent esopha-
gectomy surgery from 2010 to 2014 at the First Affiliated
Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology
and Anyang people’s hospital were investigated in this
study. Adjacent tissue samples were obtained 3 cm distant
to cancerous tissue. Thirty additional specimens were
randomly selected during endoscopic examination from
biopsy, and confirmed histologically as normal esophagus
mucosa. Demographics (sex and age) and clinicopatho-
logic features (differentiation status, lymphatic invasion,
lymph node metastasis, TNM stage) were obtained
from medical records. A smoker was defined as some-
one who had smoked one cigarette or more per day for
at least 1 year. Overall survival rates were determined
over 30 months.
Immunohistochemistry
Tissues were fixed in formalin and then embedded in par-
affin. Serial sections of 4 mm thickness were prepared and
deparaffinized by submersion in three separate concentra-
tions of ethanol (100, 95, and 70 %), and rinsing continu-
ously in distilled water for 5 min. Antigen retrieval was
performed by incubating slides in antigen retrieval Citra
plus solution (BioGenex, San Ramon, USA), according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Slides were blocked 1.5 %
normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
USA) for 30 min. Polyclonal rabbit anti-P. gingivalis

(15C8G5E6C2) antibodies [46] were utilized for the detec-
tion of P. gingivalis. Pre-immune rabbit IgG and normal
mouse IgG was used as a negative control. Primary anti-
bodies were incubated with tissue sections (anti-whole
cells 1:1000 dilution; anti-Lys-gingipain 1:500 dilution) for
12 h, 4 °C, followed by biotin-conjugated secondary
antibody for 1 h at room temperature, streptavidin-
peroxidase for 30 min at room temperature, and enzyme
substrate
(3,3′-Diaminobenzidine,
Dako,
Denmark).
As an additional control, sections were also incubated
with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) only, followed
by incubation with biotin-conjugated secondary anti-
body, streptavidin-peroxidase, and enzyme substrate.
PBS washes (3 times, 5 min each) were performed
during each incubation step. Sections were counterstained
with methyl green and visualized by light microscopy
(Eclipse 80i, Nikon, Japan). Every tissue section was evalu-
ated by two senior pathologists (Dr. Mi and Dr. Zhang).
The kappa statistic was used to assess inter-observer
variability with a score of >0.75 indicating excellent

 agreement. Staining intensity was classified using a nu-
merical scale; grade 0 (none, 0–10 % staining); grade 1
(weak, 10–30 %); grade 2 (moderate, 30–60 %), and
grade 3 (strong, over 60 %), with a score of > =2 consid-
ered positive of staining with P. gingivalis or Lys-
gingipain.
Determination of16S rDNA in fresh ESSC tissue
For each patient, tissues from cancer and adjacent to can-
cer sites (minimum 3 cm distant) were harvested and used
as experimental and internal controls, respectively. Endos-
copy biopsy specimens from healthy age- and gender-
matched individuals were obtained from normal controls
(n = 30). Tissues were suspended in 500 μl of sterile
phosphate-buffered saline, vortexed for 30 s and sonicated
for 10 s. Proteinase K (2.5 mg/ml final concentration) was
added and the samples were incubated overnight at 55 °C,
homogenized with sterile disposable pestle and vortexed.
DNA was extracted as described previously [47] and puri-
fied by phenol-chloroform extraction. All samples were
stored at −20 °C until further analysis. For amplification,
DNA concentrations were adjusted to 20 ng/ml. 16S
rDNA samples were amplified as described previously
[47] using P. gingivalis specific and universal 16S rDNA
primers (P. gingivalis 16S rDNA primer sequences were:
5′ AGGCAGCTTGCCATACTGCG 3′ (forward) and 5′
ACTGTTAGCAACTACCGATGT 3′ (reverse), and the
PCR product size was 404 bp; The universal 16S rDNA
primer
sequences
were
5′
GATTAGATACCCTGGT
AGTCCAC 3′ (forward) and 5′ CCCGGGAACGTATTC
ACCG 3′ (reverse), and the PCR product size was
688 bp). PCR reactions were performed at 95 °C for
5 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C
for 1 min, annealing at 52 °C for 1 min, and elong-
ation at 72 °C for 1 min with final elongation at 72 °C for
5 min.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed by SPSS statistical
package, version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Pearson’s contingency coefficient was used to test for the
association between the immunohistochemical staining
levels of P. gingivalis and Kgp. Correlations between the
presence of P. gingivalis and clinicopathologic factors were
analyzed by ANOVA or Chi-square test, as appropriate.
Overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
method and the log-rank test for comparison. Multivariate
analysis was performed to examine if P. gingivalis
presence was an independent prognostic factor using
the
Cox
proportional-hazards
regression
model.
P
values of ≤ 0.05 were considered to be statistically
significant.
