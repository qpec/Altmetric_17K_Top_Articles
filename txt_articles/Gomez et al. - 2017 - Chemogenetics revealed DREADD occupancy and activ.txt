The chemogenetic technology DREADD (designer receptors exclusively activated by
designer drugs) is widely used for remote manipulation of neuronal activity in freely
moving animals. DREADD technology posits the use of “designer receptors,” which are
exclusively activated by the “designer drug” clozapine N-oxide (CNO). Nevertheless, the in
vivo mechanism of action of CNO at DREADDs has never been confirmed. CNO does not
enter the brain after systemic drug injections and shows low affinity for DREADDs.
Clozapine, to which CNO rapidly converts in vivo, shows high DREADD affinity and potency.
Upon systemic CNO injections, converted clozapine readily enters the brain and occupies
central nervous system–expressed DREADDs, whereas systemic subthreshold clozapine
injections induce preferential DREADD-mediated behaviors.
T
he chemogenetic technology designer recep-
tors exclusively activated by designer drugs
(DREADD) (1) is a powerful approach for
remote and transient manipulation of cel-
lular activity in laboratory animals, with
potential for clinical therapeutics (2). DREADD
technology has been applied to the investigation
of various biological questions and disease mech-
anisms (3) by numerous laboratories around the
world. In the 10 years since its inception, there
have been more than 800 reports referring to
DREADD, with the number of publications and
laboratories using the technology growing ex-
ponentially (2).
DREADD technology posits the use of “designer
receptors”—namely, mutated human muscarinic
receptors (hM3Dq and hM4Di) that are not acti-
vated by acetylcholine or other endogenous neuro-
transmitters but exclusively via the “designer drug”
clozapine N-oxide (CNO), an inert and inactive
clozapine metabolite (1). However, the in vivo
mechanism of action of CNO at DREADDs has
never been confirmed.
We first carried out saturation binding experi-
ments in DREADD-expressing human embryonic
kidney (HEK) 293 membranes and observed no
detectable specific [3H]CNO binding (Fig. 1A). In
contrast, we observed high specific binding of
[3H]clozapine (Fig. 1B). Similar experiments were
performed by using brain tissue from mice in-
jected with hM3Dq or green fluorescent protein
(GFP) adeno-associated virus (AAV) constructs
and from hM4Di transgenic (hM4Di-Tg) and wild-
type (WT) mice (4). Again, [3H]clozapine showed
preferential binding to DREADDs over other en-
dogenous sites, whereas [3H]CNO did not bind
to either DREADD-expressing or naïve tissues
(Fig. 1, C to F).
We also performed competition binding assays
using HEK-293 membranes with [3H]clozapine
and increasing concentrations of nonradioactive
CNO (Fig. 1G) or clozapine (Fig. 1H). CNO showed
weak micromolar-level inhibition of [3H]clozapine
binding (hM3DqKi = 3.8 ± 0.3 mM and hM4DiKi = 1.5 ±
0.5 mM, where Ki is the inhibition constant),
whereas clozapine showed low nanomolar-level
inhibition of [3H]clozapine binding (hM3DqKi = 7 ±
2 nM and hM4DiKi = 3.5 ± 0.7 nM).
To visualize the specificity of [3H]clozapine
binding to DREADDs in intact brain tissue sec-
tions, we performed [3H]clozapine and [3H]CNO
autoradiography using brains from mice injected
with DREADD or GFP-expressing AAVs. We ob-
served no [3H]CNO-specific binding (Fig. 1, I and
K). In contrast, we observed high specific binding
of [3H]clozapine at the AAV-DREADD injection
sites but not at the AAV-GFP injection sites nor
at other brain areas containing endogenous
clozapine binding sites (Fig. 1, J and L) (5). Sim-
ilar experiments were carried out in rat sections
(Fig. 1M), where DREADD-mCherry immuno-
fluorescence (Fig. 1N) colocalized with specific
binding of [3H]clozapine to DREADDs (Fig. 1, O
and P). Last, we observed significantly higher
[3H]clozapine-specific binding in the hM4Di-Tg
mouse brain (cortex) as compared with that of
wild type (Fig. 1, Q and R) and an overall hM4Di
distribution as previously reported by using immu-
nohistochemistry (4).
CNO is considered inert (1); however, it has
not been evaluated, to our knowledge, for its
interactions with endogenous receptors at the
high (micromolar) concentrations that we observed
were necessary for CNO to bind to DREADDs.
Therefore, it is unknown whether its inert pro-
file would be maintained at such high concen-
trations. Accordingly, we screened CNO for its
ability to competitively inhibit binding to multi-
ple endogenous receptors and enzymes. CNO did
not show any substantial interaction at 100 nM
concentration (fig. S1). However, at 10 mM, CNO
competitively inhibited binding at several recep-
tors, including histamine H1 (~90%), 5-HT2A
(~53%), muscarinic M1 (~58%), M3 (~43%), M4
(~58%), and dopamine D1 (~24%) and D2 (~23%)
(fig. S1).
Despite the substantial number of publications
reporting successful use of DREADDs, the degree
towhichCNOentersthebraintooccupyDREADDs
has not been thoroughly investigated. On the
basis of our findings, we argue that this is a crit-
ical component of the DREADD system. That
is because (i) CNO converts to clozapine in vivo
(6–12), (ii) clozapine shows high brain permeabil-
ity (4, 13), and (iii) clozapine binds with very high
affinity to DREADDs. Therefore, a small amount
of converted clozapine from systemic CNO deliv-
ery would presumably occupy CNS-expressed
DREADDs in vivo.
On the basis of the above considerations, we
investigated the hypotheses that (i) CNO does
not readily cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB)
and (ii) the hM4Di-specific [11C]CNO binding
signal observed previously (4) could be due to
converted [11C]clozapine. We injected into the
cortex of rats hM4Di (right hemisphere) or GFP
(left hemisphere) AAVs (Fig. 2A). Rats were then
scanned by using positron emission tomography
(PET) after a bolus intravenous dose of [11C]CNO
or [11C]clozapine (~0.3 to 0.5 nmol/kg each).
[11C]CNO showed no observable brain uptake,
whereas [11C]clozapine showed substantial brain
uptake (Fig. 2B). PET images were then coregis-
tered (14) to a rat magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) template so as to localize radioligand uptake
in putative hM4Di expression sites. No [11C]CNO
signal was found (Fig. 2C). In contrast, highly
localized [11C]clozapine binding was observed at
the putative injection site of the AAV-hM4Di (Fig.
2D), which colocalized (Fig. 2, E to G) with both
hM4Di-mCherry expression and the [3H]clozapine
autoradiography signal. Dynamic [11C]CNO and
[11C]clozapine occupancy curves showed no
in vivo binding or hM4Di occupancy by [11C]CNO
(ratio < 1) (Fig. 2H) but high overall in vivo bind-
ing and specific hM4Di occupancy 45 min after
[11C]clozapine injection (Fig. 2I).
We next injected naïve mice with DREADD
or GFP AAVs into the striatum and then in-
jected them intraperitoneally with [3H]CNO or
[3H]clozapine (~5 mg/kg dose). At 30 min later,
we euthanized them and harvested blood, brain,
and peripheral organs to examine uptake of each
radioligand. No uptake was observed in brains
from DREADD-expressing mice after systemic
[3H]CNO injections (Fig. 2J). In contrast, we found

 high [3H]clozapine brain uptake and DREADD-
specific binding (colocalized with DREADD-
mCherry but not GFP expression) (Fig. 2K).
The overall distribution profile for [3H]clozapine
and [3H]CNO in peripheral organs was similar,
with the exception of the lungs (Fig. 2L).
We hypothesized that CNO may be a sub-
strate for the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump,
which limits permeability of molecules from cross-
ing the BBB (15). We tested CNO and clozapine
using a P-gp permeability assay. CNO exhibited
a high efflux (E) ratio, which was reversed after
P-gp inhibition, indicating that CNO is a P-gp sub-
strate (Fig. 2M), as recently reported (12). Clozapine
exhibited a low E ratio (E < 2), indicating that it
is not a P-gp substrate, as reported previously
(15). How does one then reconcile the numerous
publications documenting DREADD-specific CNO-
mediated effects on behavior?
CNO can convert to clozapine in vivo (6–12).
Therefore, to demonstrate that systemic CNO
injections lead to (i) clozapine conversion and
(ii) DREADD occupancy via converted clozapine,
we injected rats expressing hM4Di and GFP in
the right and left motor cortex, respectively, with
intravenous [11C]CNO (~2 to 4 nmol/kg) and har-
vested their blood and brain ~35 to 40 min later.
Plasma [11C]CNO and [11C]clozapine accounted
for ~40 and ~2%, respectively, of all radioactivity
detected (other polar and unidentified metabolites
accounted for ~58%) (fig. S2). In extracts from
brain hemispheres receiving AAV-GFP, [11C]CNO
accounted for ~76% of radioactivity detected
(other metabolites accounted for ~24%), and
no [11C]clozapine could be detected (Fig. 2, N and
P). In extracts from brain hemispheres receiving
AAV-hM4Di, [11C]CNO accounted for ~44%, whereas
[11C]clozapine accounted for ~31% of total radio-
activity detected (other metabolites accounted
for ~25%) (Fig. 2, O and P).
We next examined the putative agonistic prop-
erties of clozapine at hM3Dq and hM4Di.

 Clozapine showed greater potency [median
effective concentration (EC50) = 5.4 ± 3.1 nM] at
inducing increases in Ca2+ in hM3Dq-expressing
HEK-293 cells compared with CNO (EC50 = 85 ±
17 nM) (Fig. 3A). CNO showed greater intrinsic ef-
ficacy, which, however, was only achieved at high-
er concentrations. As expected, hM4Di-expressing
cells showed no Ca2+ response to either clozapine
or CNO (Fig. 3B). Both clozapine and CNO in-
duced significant increases in [35S]GTPgS binding
to hM4Di, but clozapine did so with significantly
greater potency at nanomolar concentrations (Fig.
3, C to G). In contrast, CNO-stimulated [35S]GTPgS
binding to hM4Di required micromolar concen-
trations (Fig. 3, C to G). Similar findings were
observed in WT and hM4Di-Tg mice (fig. S3).
To investigate DREADD-specific behavioral
responses, rats were injected bilaterally with
hM4Di and GFP AAVs or received sham surgery
into the accumbens/basal forebrain and were
tested for locomotor activity after intraperitoneal
injections of vehicle, CNO, or clozapine. A low,
subthreshold 0.1 mg/kg dose of clozapine sig-
nificantly decreased locomotor activity in hM4Di-
expressing rats but not in controls (Fig. 3H). The
magnitude of this effect was comparable with
that induced by 10 mg/kg CNO [~100-fold higher
dose, which is consistent with plasma levels
of converted [11C]clozapine (~2%) after [11C]CNO
injection]. At a higher clozapine dose (1 mg/kg),
both hM4Di-expressing rats and controls showed
decreases in locomotor activity, likely because
of sedative effects of clozapine at endogenous
sites. We also performed similar experiments in
Drd1ahM4Di mice and controls. Drd1ahM4Di mice
exhibited widespread hM4Di expression (Fig. 3I),
and thus, locomotor activity was examined after
lower doses of CNO and clozapine. We found
that 1 mg/kg CNO and 0.01 mg/kg clozapine
both significantly decreased locomotor activity
(Fig. 3I) selectively in Drd1ahM4Di mice and not
in controls.
It was recently reported that converted clozapine
reaches maximal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concen-
trations at 2 to 3 hours after CNO injection (12). We
hypothesized that any effects of CNO on locomotor
activity would thus be more likely to occur at
this time point. Indeed, we observed significant
decreases in locomotor activity in non-DREADD
control mice at 2 to 3 hours after 1 mg/kg CNO
injection, whereas 0.01 mg/kg clozapine had no
such effect (fig. S4). Accordingly, 1 mg/kg CNO
strongly inhibited locomotor activity in Drd1ahM4Di
mice at 2 to 3 hours after injection (fig. S4).

 Our collective findings indicate that systemic
CNO shows extremely low CNS presence and
highly unfavorable in vitro and in vivo phar-
macology for DREADD activation. The likely
reason for which [11C]CNO was detected in
extracts from both GFP- and hM4Di-injected brain
tissue is that [11C]CNO is circulating in brain blood
vessels or in CSF [but not within the brain (16)], as
shown previously where CNO CSF/plasma ratios
are extremely low (11, 12). Moreover, the fact that
[11C]CNO was detected in both AAV-GFP and
AAV-hM4Di extracts indicates that [11C]CNO
presence in these samples is not due to specific
DREADD binding. Last, lack of [11C]clozapine
detection in AAV-GFP extracts is in line with
CNO being inert at low (as in the trace doses
we administered here) but not at higher systemic
doses (6). Therefore, its above efficacy profile
would not be relevant for in vivo CNS DREADD
applications that use systemic CNO delivery. Fur-
thermore, for studies in which such concentra-
tions would be relevant, such as after intracranial
injections of micromolar CNO concentrations (17),
any CNO agonistic effects could be confounded
by off-target effects at endogenous receptors
(if present in the targeted region) (fig. S1). Ad-
ditionally, results may be further confounded by
local CNO-to-clozapine conversion (18) and thus
effects of converted clozapine on both DREADDs
and, if converted clozapine reaches high enough
concentrations, endogenous clozapine binding
sites as well. Additionally, experimental time
frames should be carefully considered because
of late-onset nonspecific effects of CNO, espe-
cially with repeated administration. Further-
more, intrinsic differences in metabolism between
experimental animals or future patients may
introduce experimental variability and lead
to poor reproducibility of findings. Last, im-
purities in CNO sourced commercially (such as
low CNO purity and/or residual presence of
clozapine) may further complicate interpreta-
tion of experimental results and may be re-
sponsible for inconsistencies observed across
laboratories.
Our study reveals the precise in vivo pharma-
cological mechanism of action of CNO at hM3Dq
and hM4Di DREADDs by demonstrating that
metabolically derived clozapine, arising from sys-
temic CNO administration, is the in vivo DREADD
actuator. Our findings provide context for inter-
pretation of past studies implementing DREADDs
and lead to the conclusion that investigators using
DREADD technology should use subthreshold

 doses of clozapine as the pharmacological agent
instead of high doses of CNO, whose mechanism
of action at DREADDs is mediated by converted
clozapine.
DREADD technology is considered a promis-
ing neuromodulation therapeutic for clinical
use. However, using CNO in humans has been
a limiting factor for clinical use of DREADDs
because of known conversion to clozapine in vivo
in humans. Although the use of clozapine in
humans as a DREADD actuator could potential-
ly lead to undesirable side effects, clozapine is
already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Ad-
ministration, it has been used clinically for
decades, and its pharmacokinetic and phar-
macodynamic properties and side effects are
known. Because DREADDs require very low,
subthreshold clozapine doses for their selective
activation in vivo, our findings address this
critical limitation and elevate the translational
potential of DREADD technology as a clinical
CNS therapeutic.
