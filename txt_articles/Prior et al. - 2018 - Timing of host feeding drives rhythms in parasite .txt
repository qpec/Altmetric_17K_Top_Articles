Abstract
Circadian rhythms enable organisms to synchronise the processes underpinning survival
and reproduction to anticipate daily changes in the external environment. Recent work
shows that daily (circadian) rhythms also enable parasites to maximise fitness in the context
of ecological interactions with their hosts. Because parasite rhythms matter for their fitness,
understanding how they are regulated could lead to innovative ways to reduce the severity
and spread of diseases. Here, we examine how host circadian rhythms influence rhythms in
the asexual replication of malaria parasites. Asexual replication is responsible for the sever-
ity of malaria and fuels transmission of the disease, yet, how parasite rhythms are driven
remains a mystery. We perturbed feeding rhythms of hosts by 12 hours (i.e. diurnal feeding
in nocturnal mice) to desynchronise the host’s peripheral oscillators from the central, light-
entrained oscillator in the brain and their rhythmic outputs. We demonstrate that the rhythms
of rodent malaria parasites in day-fed hosts become inverted relative to the rhythms of para-
sites in night-fed hosts. Our results reveal that the host’s peripheral rhythms (associated
with the timing of feeding and metabolism), but not rhythms driven by the central, light-
entrained circadian oscillator in the brain, determine the timing (phase) of parasite rhythms.
Further investigation reveals that parasite rhythms correlate closely with blood glucose
rhythms. In addition, we show that parasite rhythms resynchronise to the altered host feed-
ing rhythms when food availability is shifted, which is not mediated through rhythms in the
host immune system. Our observations suggest that parasites actively control their develop-
mental rhythms. Finally, counter to expectation, the severity of disease symptoms
expressed by hosts was not affected by desynchronisation of their central and peripheral
rhythms. Our study at the intersection of disease ecology and chronobiology opens up a
new arena for studying host-parasite-vector coevolution and has broad implications for
applied bioscience.

 Author summary
How cycles of asexual replication by malaria parasites are coordinated to occur in syn-
chrony with the circadian rhythms of the host is a long-standing mystery. We reveal that
rhythms associated with the time-of-day that hosts feed are responsible for the timing of
rhythms in parasite development. Specifically, we altered host feeding time to phase-shift
peripheral rhythms, whilst leaving rhythms driven by the central circadian oscillator in
the brain unchanged. We found that parasite developmental rhythms remained synchro-
nous but changed their phase, by 12 hours, to follow the timing of host feeding. Further-
more, our results suggest that parasites themselves schedule rhythms in their replication
to coordinate with rhythms in glucose in the host’s blood, rather than have rhythms
imposed upon them by, for example, host immune responses. Our findings reveal a novel
relationship between hosts and parasites that if disrupted, could reduce both the severity
and transmission of malaria infection.
Introduction
The discovery of daily rhythms in parasites dates back to the Hippocratic era and a taxonomi-
cally diverse range of parasites (including fungi, helminths, Coccidia, nematodes, trypano-
somes, and malaria parasites [1–6]) display rhythms in development and several behaviours.
Yet, how rhythms in many parasite traits are established and maintained remains mysterious,
despite their significance, as these traits underpin the replication and transmission of parasites
[7]. For example, metabolic rhythms of Trypanosoma brucei have recently been demonstrated
to be under the control of an oscillator belonging to the parasite, but the constituents of this
oscillator are unknown [8]. In most organisms, endogenous circadian oscillators (“clocks”)
involve transcription-translation feedback loops whose timing is synchronised to external
cues, such as light-dark and feeding-fasting cycles [9,10] but there is generally little homology
across taxa in the genes underpinning oscillators. Multiple, convergent, evolutionary origins
for circadian oscillators is thought to be explained by the fitness advantages of being able to
anticipate and exploit predictable daily changes in the external environment, as well as keeping
internal processes optimally timed [11,12]. Indeed, the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medi-
cine recognises the importance of circadian oscillators [13,14].
The environment that an endoparasite experiences inside its host is generated by many
rhythmic processes, including daily fluctuations in the availability of resources, and the nature
and strength of immune responses [15,16]. Coordinating development and behaviour with
rhythms in the host (or vector) matters for parasite fitness [17]. For example, disrupting syn-
chrony between rhythms in the host and rhythms in the development of malaria parasites dur-
ing asexual replication reduces parasite proliferation and transmission potential [18,19].
Malaria parasites develop synchronously during cycles of asexual replication in the host’s
blood and each developmental stage occurs at a particular time-of-day. The synchronous
bursting of parasites at the end of their asexual cycle, when they release their progeny to infect
new red blood cells, causes fever with sufficient regularity (24, 48, or 72 hourly, depending on
the species) to have been used as a diagnostic tool. Malaria parasites are assumed to be intrinsi-
cally arrhythmic and mathematical modelling suggests that rhythms in host immune effectors,
particularly inflammatory responses, could generate rhythms in the development of malaria
parasites via time-of-day-specific killing of different parasite developmental stages [20,21].
However, the relevant processes operating within real infections remain unknown [22].

 Our main aim is to use the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi to ask which cir-
cadian rhythms of the host are involved in scheduling rhythms in parasite development. In the
blood, P. chabaudi develops synchronously and asexual cycles last 24 hours, bursting to release
progeny (schizogony) in the middle of the night when mice are awake and active. We per-
turbed host feeding time (timing of food intake), which is known to desynchronise the phase
of rhythms from the host’s central and peripheral oscillators, and we then examined the conse-
quences for parasite rhythms. In mammals, the central oscillator in the brain (suprachiasmatic
nuclei of the hypothalamus, SCN), is entrained by light [10,23]. The SCN is thought to shape
rhythms in physiology and behaviour (peripheral rhythms) by entraining peripheral oscillators
via hormones such as glucocorticoids [24]. However, oscillators in peripheral tissues are self-
sustained and can also be entrained by several non-photic cues, such as the time-of-day at
which feeding occurs [25,26]. Thus, eating at the wrong time-of-day (e.g. diurnal feeding in
nocturnal mice) leads to altered timing of oscillators, and their associated rhythms in periph-
eral tissues. This phase-shift is particularly apparent in the liver where an inversion in the peak
phase of expression of the circadian oscillator genes Per1 and Per2 occurs [26]. Importantly,
eating at the wrong time-of-day does not alter rhythmic outputs from the central oscillator
[25].
In murine hosts with an altered (diurnal) feeding schedule, the development rhythms of
parasites remained synchronous but became inverted relative to the rhythms of parasites in
hosts fed at night. Thus, feeding-related outputs from the hosts peripheral timing system, not
the SCN, are responsible for the timing (phase) of parasite rhythms. We also reveal that the
inversion of parasite rhythms corresponds to a phase-shift in blood glucose rhythms. That par-
asites remain synchronous during the rescheduling of their rhythm coupled with evidence that
immune responses do not set the timing of parasite rhythms, suggests parasites are responsible
for scheduling their developmental rhythm, and may express their own circadian rhythms
and/or oscillators. Furthermore, our perturbed feeding regimes are comparable to shift work
in humans. This lifestyle is well-known for increasing the risk of non-communicable diseases
(cancer, type 2 diabetes etc. [27]) but our data suggest the severity of malaria infection (weight
loss, anaemia) is not exacerbated by short-term desynchronisation of the central and periph-
eral oscillators.
Results and discussion
First, we examined the effects of changing the time of food intake on the phasing of circadian
rhythms in host body temperature and locomotor activity (Fig 1). Body temperature is a com-
monly used phase marker of circadian timing because core body temperature increases during
activity and decreases during sleep [28,29]. Mice were given access to food for 12 hours in each
circadian cycle, either in the day (LF, light fed) or night (DF, dark fed). All food was available
ad libitum and available from ZT 0–12 (ZT refers to ‘Zeitgeber Time’; ZT 0 is the time in hours
since lights on) for LF mice, and from ZT 12–24 for DF mice. All experimental mice were
entrained to the same reversed photoperiod, lights on: 7pm (ZT 0/24), lights off: 7am (ZT 12),
for 2 weeks prior to starting the experiment (Fig 1).
We found a significant interaction between feeding treatment (LF or DF) and the time-of-
day (day (ZT 0–12) or night (ZT 12–24)) that mice experience elevated body temperatures
(χ2
(5,6) = 75.89, p < 0.0001) and increase their locomotor activity (χ2
(5,6) = 39.57, p < 0.0001;
S1 Table). Specifically, DF mice have elevated body temperature and are mostly active during
the night (as expected) whereas LF mice show no such day-night difference in body tempera-
ture and locomotor activity, due to a lack of night time elevation in both measures where food
and light associated activity are desynchronised (Fig 2). We also find the centres of gravity

 (CoG; a general phase marker of circadian rhythms, estimated with CircWave), are slightly but
significantly earlier in LF mice for both body temperature (approximately 2 hours advanced:
χ2
(3,4) = 28.17, p < 0.0001) and locomotor activity (approximately 4 hours advanced: χ2
(3,4) =
27.32, p < 0.0001) (S1 Table). Therefore, the LF mice experienced a significant change in the
daily profile of activity, which is reflected in some phase advance (but not inversion) relative to
DF mice, and significant disruption to their body temperature and locomotor activity rhythms,
particularly during the night. Because an altered feeding schedule does not affect the phase of
the SCN [25], our data suggest that rhythms in body temperature and locomotor activity in LF
mice are shaped by both rhythms in feeding and the light-dark cycle [30]. Finally, the body
Fig 1. Experimental design, feeding time. Infections were initiated with parasites raised in donor mice entrained to a
standard light regime [lights on: 7am (ZT 0/24) and lights off: 7pm (ZT 12)] and used to create experimental infections
in hosts entrained to a reverse light regime of 12-hours light: 12-hours dark [lights on: 7pm (ZT 0/24), lights off: 7am
(ZT 12); ZT is Zeitgeber Time: hours after lights on], leading to a 12-hour phase difference in SCN rhythms of donor
and host, and subsequently, parasite infections (see Materials and Methods for the rationale). Hosts were then assigned
to one of the two treatment groups. One group (N = 10) were allowed access to food between ZT0 and ZT12 (“light fed
mice”, LF, food access during the day) and the other group (N = 10) allowed access to food between ZT12 and ZT0
(“dark fed mice”, DF, food access during the night). Body temperature and locomotor activity were recorded from a
subset of RFID “tagged” mice in each group (N = 5 per group). Changing feeding time (day time feeding of nocturnal
mice) desynchronises rhythmic outputs from the central (SCN) oscillator and the peripheral (peripheral rhythms, PRs)
oscillators (“SCN 6¼ PRs”), whereas the SCN and peripheral rhythms remain synchronised in mice fed at night
(“SCN = PRs”).

 weight of LF and DF mice did not differ significantly after 4 weeks (χ2
(3,4) = 0.02, p = 0.9) and
both groups equally gained weight during the experiment (S1 Fig), corroborating that LF mice
were not calorie restricted.
Having generated hosts in which the phase relationship between the light-entrained SCN
and food-entrained rhythms are altered (LF mice) or not (DF mice), we then infected all mice
with the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi adami genotype DK (Fig 1) from
donor mice experiencing a light-dark cycle 12 hours out of phase with the experimental host
mice. After allowing the parasite’s developmental rhythms to become established (see Materi-
als and Methods) we compared the rhythms of parasites in LF and DF mice. We hypothesised
that if parasite rhythms are solely determined by rhythms driven by the host’s SCN (which are

 inverted in the host mice compared to the donor mice), parasite rhythms would equally shift
and match in LF and DF mice because both groups of hosts were entrained to the same light-
dark conditions. Yet, if rhythms in body temperature or locomotor activity directly or indi-
rectly (via entraining other oscillators) contribute to parasite rhythms, we expected that para-
site rhythms would differ between LF and DF hosts. Further, if feeding directly or indirectly
(via food-entrained oscillators) drives parasite rhythms, we predicted that parasite rhythms
would become inverted (Fig 1).
In the blood, P. chabaudi parasites transition through five developmental stages during
each (~24hr) cycle of asexual replication (Fig 3A) [6,31]. We find that four of the five develop-
mental stages (rings, and early-, mid-, and late-trophozoites) display 24hr rhythms in both LF
and DF mice (Fig 3B, S2 Table, S2 Fig). The fifth stage—schizonts—appear arrhythmic but this
stage sequesters in the host’s tissues [32,33] and so, are rarely collected in venous blood sam-
ples. Given that all other stages are rhythmic, and that rhythms in ring stages likely require
their parental schizonts to have been rhythmic, we expect schizonts are rhythmic but that
sequestration prevents a reliable assessment of their rhythms.
The CoG estimates for ring, and early-, mid-, and late-trophozoite stages are approximately
10–12 hours out-of-phase between the LF and DF mice (Fig 3B and 3C, S2 Table). For exam-
ple, rings peak at approximately ZT 10 in LF mice and peak close to ZT 23 in DF mice. The
other stages peak in sequence. Schizogony (when parasites burst to release their progeny)
occurs immediately prior to reinvasion, therefore we expect it occurs during the day for the LF
mice and night for DF mice [7]. The almost complete inversion in parasite rhythms between
LF and DF mice demonstrates that feeding-related rhythms are responsible for the phase of
parasite rhythms, with little to no apparent contribution from the SCN and/or the light: dark
cycle.
Changing the feeding time of nocturnal mice to the day time has similarities with shift
work in diurnal humans [34]. This lifestyle is associated with an increased risk of acquiring
non-communicable diseases (e.g. cancer, diabetes) [35] and has been recapitulated in mouse
models [e.g. 36,37,38]. In contrast, in response to perturbation of their feeding rhythm, infec-
tions are not more severe in hosts whose circadian rhythms are desynchronised (i.e. LF hosts).
Specifically, all mice survived infection and virulence (measured as host anaemia; reduction in
red blood cells) of LF and DF infections is not significantly different (comparing minimum
red blood cell density, χ2
(3,4) = 0.11, p = 0.74; S3A Fig). As described above, changes in body
mass were not significantly different between treatments (S1 Fig). Using a longer-term model
for shift work may reveal differences in infection severity, especially when combined with the
development of non-communicable disease.
There are no significant differences between parasite densities in LF and DF hosts during
infections (LF versus DF on day 6 post infection, χ2
(3,5) = 0.66, p = 0.42, S3B Fig). This can be
explained by both groups being mismatched to the SCN of the host, which we have previously
demonstrated to have negative consequences for P. chabaudi [18]. Our previous work was car-
ried out using P. chabaudi genotype AJ so is not directly comparable to our results presented
here, because DK is a less virulent genotype [39]. Instead, a comparison of our results to data
collected previously for genotype DK, in an experiment where SCN rhythms of donor and
host mice were matched (see Materials and Methods; infections were initiated with the same
strain, sex, and age of mice, the same dose at ring stage) reveals a cost of mismatch of donor
and host entrainment. Specifically, parasite density on day 6 (when infections have established
but before parasites start being cleared by host immunity) is significantly lower in infections
mismatched to the SCN (LF and DF) compared to infections matched to the SCN (χ2
(3,5) =
16.71, p = 0.0002, mean difference = 2.21e+10 parasites per ml blood) (see S4A Fig). In keeping
with a difference in parasite replication, hosts with matched infections reach lower red blood

 Fig 3. Parasite rhythms are inverted in hosts fed during the day compared to the night. (A) The asexual cycle of malaria parasites is characterised by five
morphologically distinct developmental stages (ring, early trophozoite, mid trophozoite, late trophozoite) differentiated by parasite size within the red blood cell, the size
and number of nuclei, and the appearance of haemozoin [31]. (B) Mean ± SEM (N = 10 per group) proportion of observed parasites in the blood at ring stage in light fed

The proportion of parasites at ring stage in the peripheral blood is highest at night (ZT 22) in dark fed mice but in the day (ZT 10) for light fed mice, illustrating the

 cell densities (χ2

blood).
The mismatched and matched infections compared above also differ in whether hosts had
food available throughout the 24-hour cycle or for 12 hours only (LF and DF). Restricting food
to 12 hours per day does not affect host weight (S1 Fig) and mice still undergo their main activ-
ity bout at lights off even when food is available all the time. Therefore, we propose that rather
than feeding duration, mismatch to the host SCN for as few as 5 cycles is costly to parasite rep-
lication and reduces infection severity. Because peripheral and SCN driven rhythms are usually
in synchrony, we suggest parasites use information from food-entrained oscillators, or meta-
bolic processes, to ensure their development is timed to match the host’s SCN rhythms.
Instead of organising their own rhythms (i.e. using an “oscillator” whose time is set by a
“Zeitgeber” or by responding directly to time-of-day cues), parasites may allow outputs of
food-entrained host oscillators to enforce developmental rhythms. Previous studies have
focused on rhythmic immune responses as the key mechanism that schedules parasite rhythms
(via developmental-stage and time-of-day specific killing [20,21]). Evidence that immune
responses are rhythmic in naïve as well as infected hosts is increasing [15,16], but the extent to
which peripheral/food-entrained oscillators and the SCN drive immune rhythms is unclear.
Nonetheless, we argue that rhythms in host immune responses do not play a significant role in
scheduling parasites for the following reasons: First, mismatch to the host’s peripheral rhythms
(which occurs in DF mice but not LF mice as a feature of our experimental design) does not
cause a significant reduction in parasite number (S3B Fig), demonstrating that stage-specific
killing cannot cause the differently phased parasite rhythms in LF and DF mice. Second, while
changing feeding time appears to disrupt some rodent immune responses [40,41], effectors
important in malaria infection, including leukocytes in the blood, do not entrain to feeding
rhythms [42,43]. Third, inflammatory responses important for killing malaria parasites are
upregulated within hours of blood stage infection [44] so their footprint on parasite rhythms
should be apparent from the first cycles of replication [19]. In contrast, rhythms of parasites in
LF and DF mice do not significantly diverge until 5–6 days post infection, after 5 replication
cycles (S3 Table, Fig 4). Fourth, an additional experiment (see Materials and Methods) reveals
that rhythms in the major inflammatory cytokines that mediate malaria infection (e.g. IFN-
gamma and TNF-alpha: [45,46,47,48]) follow the phase of parasite rhythms (Fig 5), with other
cytokines/chemokines also experiencing this phenomenon (S5 Fig). Specifically, mice infected
with P. chabaudi genotype AS undergoing schizogony at around midnight (ZT17), produce
peaks in the cytokines IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha at ZT21 and ZT19 respectively (following a
significantly 24h pattern: IFN-gamma p = 0.0055, TNF-alpha p = 0.0015). Whereas mice
infected with mismatched parasites undergoing schizogony around ZT23 (6 hours later), expe-
rience 3–6 hour delays in the peaks of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha (IFN-gamma: ZT0, TNF-
alpha: ZT1; following a significantly 24h pattern: IFN-gamma p = 0.0172, TNF-alpha
p = 0.0041). Thus, even if parasites at different development stages differ in their sensitivity to
these cytokines, these immune rhythms could only serve to increase synchrony in the parasite
rhythm but not change its timing.
More in-depth analysis of LF and DF infections provides further support that parasites
actively organise their developmental rhythms. We examined whether parasites in DF mice
maintain synchrony and duration of different developmental stages during rescheduling to the
host’s SCN rhythms. Desynchronisation of oscillators manifests as a reduction in amplitude in
rhythms that are driven by more than one oscillator (e.g. parasite and host oscillator). No loss
in amplitude suggests that parasites shift their timing as a cohort without losing synchrony.
Parasite rhythms in LF and DF mice did not differ significantly in amplitude (χ2
(6,7) = 1.53,
p = 0.22, S4A Table) and CoGs for sequential stages are equally spaced (χ2
(10,18) = 11.75,

 p = 0.16, S2 Table) demonstrating that parasite stages develop at similar rates in both groups.
The rhythms of parasites in LF and DF mice were not intensively sampled until days 6–8 PI,
raising the possibility that parasites lost and regained synchrony before this. Previously col-
lected data for P. chabaudi genotype AS infections mismatched to the host SCN by 12 hours
that have achieved a 6-hour shift by day 4 PI also exhibit synchronous development (S4B Table
and S6 Fig), suggesting that parasites reschedule in synch.
That parasite rhythms do not differ significantly between LF and DF mice until day 5–6
post infection (Fig 4) could be explained by the parasites experiencing a phenomenon akin to
jet lag. Jet lag results from the fundamental, tissue-specific robustness of circadian oscillators
to perturbation, which slows down the phase shift of individual oscillators to match a change
in ‘time-zone’ [10]. We propose that the most likely explanation for the data gathered from
our main experiment for genotype DK, and that collected previously for AJ and AS, is that par-
asites possess intrinsic oscillators that shift collectively, in a synchronous manner, by a few
hours each day, until they re-entrain to the new ‘time-zone’. Because there is no loss of ampli-
tude of parasite rhythms, it is less likely that individual parasites possess intrinsic oscillators
that re-entrain at different rates to the new ‘time-zone’. The recently demonstrated ability of
parasites to communicate decisions about asexual to sexual developmental switches [49] could
also be involved in organising asexual development.
If parasites have evolved a mechanism to keep time and schedule their rhythms, what exter-
nal information might they synchronise to? Despite melatonin peaks in lab mice being brief
and of low concentration [50,51], the host’s pineal melatonin rhythms have been suggested as
a parasite time cue [52]. However, we can likely rule pineal melatonin, and other glucocorti-
coids, out because they are largely driven by rhythms of the SCN, which follow the light-dark
Fig 4. Parasite rhythms in light and dark fed mice significantly diverge by day 5–6 post infection. The proportion of ring stage parasites across infections (light fed
mice, red, and dark fed mice, blue) as a phase marker reveals that rhythms of parasites in light fed mice (red) and dark fed mice (blue) diverge. Mice were sampled at ZT 12
on days 2, 4 and 6 and at ZT 0 on days 3, 5 and 7 post infection (see Fig 3 and S2 Fig). Consistent significant differences (��, p < 0.05; ���, p < 0.001) between feeding
treatments begins on day 5. By days 6–7 post infection, rings in light fed mice are present at ZT12 while rings in dark fed mice are present at ZT 0, indicating that parasites
in dark fed mice have rescheduled. Ring stages are presented as the phase marker because this is the most accurately quantified stage but other stages follow a similar
pattern (S3 Table). Mean ± SEM is plotted and N = 10 for each treatment group.

 cycle and have not been shown to phase shift by 12 hours as a result of perturbing feeding tim-
ing [25]; some glucocorticoid rhythms appear resistant to changing feeding time [53]. Whether
extra-pineal melatonin, produced by the gut for example [54], could influence the rhythms of
parasites residing in the blood merits further investigation. Body temperature rhythms have

 deploy the same mechanisms to organise developmental transitions in the host. Body tempera-
ture rhythms did not fully invert in LF mice but they did exhibit unusually low (i.e. day time)
temperatures at night. Thus, for body temperature to be a time-of-day cue or Zeitgeber it
requires that parasites at early developmental stages (e.g. rings or early trophozoites) are
responsible for time-keeping because they normally experience low temperatures during the
day when the host is resting. The same logic applies to rhythms in locomotor activity because
it is very tightly correlated to body temperature (Pearson’s correlation R = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.82–
0.88). Locomotor activity affects other rhythms, such as physiological oxygen levels (daily
rhythms in blood and tissue oxygen levels), which can reset circadian oscillators [57] and have
been suggested as a time cue for filarial nematodes [4].
Feeding rhythms were inverted in LF and DF mice and so, the most parsimonious explana-
tion is that parasites are sensitive to rhythms related to host metabolism and/or food-entrained
oscillators. Malaria parasites have the capacity to actively alter their replication rate in response
to changes in host nutritional status [58]. Thus, we propose that parasites also possess a mecha-
nism to coordinate their development with rhythms in the availability of nutritional resources
in the blood. Further work could explore whether parasites use information via the kinase
‘KIN’ to regulate their timing [58]. KIN shares homology with AMP-activated kinases
(AMPK), mammalian metabolic sensors implicated in both circadian timing and metabolic
regulation [59]. Glucose, and other sugars that require metabolising, suppresses the activation
of AMPK and its subsequent nutrient-sensing signalling cascade, with KIN proposed to act as
a nutrient sensor to reduce parasite replication rate in response to calorie restriction during
malaria infection [58]. Rhythms in blood glucose are a well-documented consequence of
rhythms in feeding timing [60] and glucose is an important resource for parasites [61]. We per-
formed an additional experiment to quantify blood glucose rhythms in (uninfected) LF and DF
mice (Fig 6A and 6B). Despite the homeostatic regulation of blood glucose, we find its concen-
tration varies across the circadian cycle, and is borderline significantly rhythmic in DF mice
(p = 0.07, peak time = ZT17.84, estimated with CircWave) and follows a significantly 24-hour
pattern in LF mice (p < 0.0001, peak time = ZT8.78). Glucose rhythms/patterns are shaped by
feeding regime (time-of-day: feeding treatment χ2
(18,32) = 45.49, p < 0.0001). Specifically, during
the night, DF mice have significantly higher blood glucose than LF mice (t = 3.41, p = 0.01,
mean difference 20.6mg/dl±7.32) and there is a trend for LF mice to have higher blood glucose
than DF mice during the day (t = -0.94, p = 0.78, mean difference 7.9mg/dl±9.86).
Titrating whether glucose availability is high or low would only provide parasites with
information on whether it is likely to be day or night, and a 12-hour window in which to make
developmental transitions should erode synchrony, especially as glucose rhythms are weak in
DF mice. Instead, parasites may use the sharp rise in blood glucose that occurs in both LF and
DF mice after their main bout of feeding as a cue for dusk (S5 Table; regions with solid lines
connecting before and after feeding in Fig 6), using KIN as a sensor [58]. In line with the
effects of feeding timing we observe in mice, a recent study of humans reveals that changing
feeding time can induce a phase-shift in glucose rhythms, but not insulin rhythms [43]. Alter-
natively, parasites may be sensitive to fluctuations in other factors due to rhythms in food
intake, such as amino acids [62] or other rhythmic metabolites that appear briefly in the blood
after feeding, changes in oxygen consumption, blood pressure or blood pH [63,64].
In summary, we show that peripheral, food-entrained host rhythms, but not central, light-
entrained host rhythms are responsible for the timing of developmental transitions during the
asexual replication cycles of malaria parasites. Taken together, our observations suggest that
parasites have evolved a time-keeping mechanism that uses daily fluctuations in resource avail-
ability (e.g. glucose) as a time-of-day cue or Zeitgeber to match the phase of asexual develop-
ment to the host’s SCN rhythms. Why coordination with the SCN is important remains

 mysterious. Uncovering how parasites tell the time could enable an intervention (ecological
trap) to “trick” parasites into adopting suboptimal rhythms for their fitness.
Materials and methods
We conducted an experiment to investigate whether host peripheral rhythms or those driven
by the SCN affect rhythms in the asexual development of malaria parasites. Our findings stim-
ulated the analysis of four further data sets stemming from three independent experiments.
Data available from the Dryad Digital Repository: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.jt224 [65].
Here, we detail the approach used for our main experiment “Effect of feeding time on parasite
rhythms” before briefly outlining the approaches used in the analyses of additional data “Costs
of mismatch to host SCN rhythms”, “Rhythms in cytokines during malaria infection”, “Syn-
chrony during rescheduling” and “Effect of feeding time on blood glucose rhythms”.
Effect of feeding time on parasite rhythms
Experimental design. Both LF (“light-fed mice”, access to food during the day, ZT 0–12)
and DF (“dark-fed mice”, access to food during the night, ZT 12–0) mice were kept in the
same light-dark cycle to ensure the phase of their central oscillators did not differ (because the
SCN is primarily entrained by light [23]) (Fig 1). Changing host feeding time in LF mice cre-
ated an in-host environment where peripheral rhythms associated with feeding are out of
phase with the SCN, but in phase in DF mice. Every 12 hours, food was added/removed from
cages and the cages thoroughly checked for evidence of hoarding, which was never observed.
All experimental infections were initiated with parasites from donor mice in light-dark cycles
that were out of phase with the experimental host’s light-dark cycles by 12 hours, leading to a
12-hour phase difference in SCN entrainment of donor and host. Specifically, infections were
initiated with ring stage parasites (which appear in the early morning) collected from donor
mice and injected immediately into host mice which experiencing their evening. Parasites that
are mismatched by 12 hours to mice with synchronised SCN and peripheral rhythms (i.e. DF
mice) take around one week to reschedule [66,67,18]. Therefore, if peripheral rhythms but not
SCN rhythms, affect parasite rhythms, by starting infections with mismatched parasites we
expected that parasites in DF mice would reschedule within 7 days whereas rhythms in the LF
mice would not change (or change less). Because rhythms generally return to their original
state after perturbation faster than they can be shifted from homeostasis [68], studying the
change in rhythms of mismatched parasites ensured we could observe any divergence between
parasite rhythms in LF and DF mice before host immune responses and anaemia clear
infections.
Parasites and hosts. We used 20 eight-week-old male mice, strain MF1 (in house sup-
plier, University of Edinburgh), entrained to a reverse lighting schedule for 2 weeks before
starting the experiment. After entrainment, mice were randomly allocated to one of two
feeding treatments for the entire experiment (Fig 1). After 2 weeks on the assigned feeding
treatment we recorded body temperature and locomotor activity for 48 hours. We used Bio-
Thermo13 RFID (radio frequency identification) tags (Biomark, Idaho, USA) in conjunction

allowed access to food from ZT 0-ZT 12) and dark fed mice (DF, grey bars; allowed access to food from ZT 12-ZT 0). Blood glucose
concentration was measured every ~2 hours for 30 hours from ZT 0. Steep increases in blood glucose concentration occur as a result of the main
bout of feeding in each group (i.e. just after lights on in LF mice and lights off in DF mice, illustrated by the regions with solid lines connecting
before and after the main bout, see S5 Table), and suggests glucose concentration is inverted during the night. Light and dark bars indicate lights
on and lights off (lights on: ZT 0, lights off: ZT 12). B) as for A, but plotted as a polar graph with corresponding developmental stages for each

 with a Home Cage Analysis system (Actual HCA, Actual Analytics Ltd, Edinburgh, Scotland),
which enables body temperature and locomotor activity readings to be taken every 0.05 sec-
onds without disturbing the animals (using a network of antennae spaced approximately 10.9
cm apart). Next, all mice were intravenously infected with 1 x 107 Plasmodium chabaudi adami
(avirulent genotype, DK) parasitised red blood cells (at ring stage). We used DK to minimise
disruption to host feeding compared to infection with more virulent genotypes that cause
more severe sickness [39]. All mice were blood sampled from the tail vein twice daily (ZT0 and
ZT12) on days 0–5 and every 6 hours from days 6–8 post infection (PI). The densities and
developmental stages of parasites in experimental infections were determined from thin blood
smears (day 2 PI onwards, when parasites become visible in the blood) and red blood cell
(RBC) densities by flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter).
Costs of mismatch to host SCN rhythms
We compared the performance of parasites in our main experiment (in which infections were
initiated with parasites from donor mice that were mismatched to the host’s SCN rhythms by
12 hours), to the severity of infections when infections are initiated with parasites from donor
mice that are matched to the host’s SCN rhythms. Twelve infections were established in the
manner used in our main experiment (eight-week-old male mice, strain MF1, intravenously
infected with 1 x 107 P. chabaudi DK parasitised RBC), except that donor SCN rhythms were
matched to the experimental host’s SCN rhythm and hosts had access to food day and night.
Densities of parasites were quantified from blood smears and RBC density by flow cytometry
on day 6 and 9 PI, respectively. We chose to compare parasite density in matched infections to
LF and DF infections on day 6 PI because parasites are approaching peak numbers in the
blood (before host immunity starts to clear infections) and their high density facilitates accu-
rate quantification when using microscopy.
Rhythms in cytokines during malaria infection
This experiment probes whether host immune responses mounted during the early phase of
malaria infection could impose development rhythms upon parasites. We entrained N = 86
eight-week-old female mice, strain MF1, to either a reverse lighting schedule (lights on 7pm,
lights off 7am, N = 43) or a standard lighting schedule (lights on 7am, lights off 7pm, N = 43).
Donor mice, infected with P. chabaudi genotype AS, were entrained to a standard lighting
schedule to generate infections matched and 12 hours mismatched relative to the SCN in the
experimental mice. Mice were intravenously injected with 1 x 107 parasitised RBC at ring
stage. Genotype AS has intermediate virulence [39] and was used to ensure immune responses
were elicited by day 4 PI. We terminally sampled 4 mice every 3 hours over 30 hours starting
on day 4 PI, taking blood smears, red blood cell counts and collecting plasma for Luminex
cytokine assays.
Cytokines were assayed by the Human Immune Monitoring Centre at Stanford University
using mouse 38-plex kits (eBiosciences/Affymetrix) and used according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations with modifications as described below. Briefly, beads were added to a
96-well plate and washed in a Biotek ELx405 washer. 60uL of plasma per sample was submitted
for processing. Samples were added to the plate containing the mixed antibody-linked beads
and incubated at room temperature for one hour followed by overnight incubation at 4˚C
with shaking. Cold and room temperature incubation steps were performed on an orbital
shaker at 500–600 rpm. Following the overnight incubation, plates were washed as above and
then a biotinylated detection antibody was added for 75 minutes at room temperature with
shaking. Plates were washed as above and streptavidin-PE was added. After incubation for 30

 minutes at room temperature a wash was performed as above and reading buffer was added to
the wells. Each sample was measured as singletons. Plates were read using a Luminex 200
instrument with a lower bound of 50 beads per sample per cytokine. Custom assay control
beads by Radix Biosolutions were added to each well.
Synchrony during rescheduling
We staged the parasites from the blood smears collected from the infections used to assay cyto-
kines (above) to investigate their synchrony during rescheduling. The infections from mis-
matched donor mice began 12 hours out of phase with the host SCN rhythms and the CoG for
ring stage parasites reveals they had become rescheduled by 6 hours on day 4 PI. We focus on
the ring stage as a phase marker–for the analysis of synchrony in these data and the divergence
between LF and DF parasites–because rings are the most morphologically distinct, and so,
accurately quantified, stage.
Blood glucose concentration
In a third additional experiment, we entrained 10 eight-week-old male mice, strain MF1, to a
standard lighting schedule for 2 weeks before randomly allocating them to one of two feeding
treatments. One group (N = 5) were allowed access to food between ZT 0 and ZT 12 (equiva-
lent to the LF group in the main experiment) and the other group (N = 5) allowed access to
food between ZT 12 and ZT 0 (equivalent to the DF group). After 10 days of food restriction
we recorded blood glucose concentration every 2 hours for 30 hours, using an Accu-Chek Per-
forma glucometer.
Data analysis
We used CircWave (version 1.4, developed by R.A. Hut; available from https://www.euclock.
org) to characterise host and parasite rhythms, and R v. 3.1.3 (The R Foundation for Statistical
Computing, Vienna, Austria) for analysis of summary metrics and non-circadian dynamics of
infection. Specifically, testing for rhythmicity, estimating CoG (a reference point to compare
circadian rhythms) for host (body temperature, locomotor activity, blood glucose concentra-
tion) and parasite rhythms, and amplitude for parasite stage proportions, was carried out with
CircWave for each individual infection. However, the cytokine data display high variation
between mice (due to a single sample from each mouse) so we calculated a more robust esti-
mate of phase than CoG by fitting a sine curve with a 24h period (using CircWave) and finding
the maxima. Linear regression models and simultaneous inference of group means (using the
multcomp R package) were run with R to compare summary measures that characterise
rhythms, parasite performance, glucose concentration and disease severity. R was also used to
construct and compared linear mixed effects models using which included mouse ID as a ran-
dom effect (to account for repeated measures from each infection) to compare dynamics of
parasite and RBC density throughout infections, and glucose concentration throughout the
day.

each rhythm (mean ± SEM), comparisons of CoG for parasites in light (LF) and dark (DF) fed
mice. Analysis shows CoGs are significantly different between treatment groups for each
rhythmic parasite stage. The interval between the CoGs of sequential stages is used as a proxy
for the developmental duration of each stage (see Fig 3C). There is a non-significant interac-
tion between parasite stage and treatment (LF, DF) on interval duration (χ2
(10,18) = 11.75,
p = 0.16) suggesting parasites develop through the asexual cycle at similar rates in both feeding
treatments. Only rings, early and mid trophozoites are used to calculate the interval difference,
as they are the most abundant stages. Intervals are calculated with respect to LF. For example,
a negative interval indicates that the difference between ring and early trophozoite CoGs is
longer in DF infections than LF. Sampling occurred every 6 hours during days 6–8 post infec-

 for each sampling point comes from multiple different infections which means CircWave gen-
erates a single curve for each stage (a curve for each infection is generated in A). Thus, error
for amplitude and CoG cannot be calculated, and so means cannot be statistically compared.
