Background: Folic acid fortification significantly reduced the prevalence of neural
tube defects (NTDs) in the United States. The popularity of “low carb” diets raises
concern that women who intentionally avoid carbohydrates, thereby consuming fewer
fortified foods, may not have adequate dietary intake of folic acid.
Methods: To assess the association between carbohydrate intake and NTDs, we ana-
lyzed data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study from 1,740 mothers of
infants, stillbirths, and terminations with anencephaly or spina bifida (cases), and
9,545 mothers of live born infants without a birth defect (controls) conceived between
1998 and 2011. Carbohydrate and folic acid intake before conception were estimated
from food frequency questionnaire responses. Restricted carbohydrate intake was
defined as �5th percentile among controls. Odds ratios were estimated with logistic
regression and adjusted for maternal race/ethnicity, education, alcohol use, folic acid
supplement use, study center, and caloric intake.
Results: Mean dietary intake of folic acid among women with restricted carbohy-
drate intake was less than half that of other women (p < .01), and women with
restricted carbohydrate intake were slightly more likely to have an infant with an
NTD (AOR 5 1.30, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.67).
Conclusions: This is the first study to examine the association between carbohydrate
intake and NTDs among pregnancies conceived postfortification. We found that
women with restricted carbohydrate intake were 30% more likely to have an infant
with anencephaly or spina bifida. However, more research is needed to understand
the pathways by which restricted carbohydrate intake might increase the risk of
NTDs.

INTRODUCTION
Following decades of research establishing the link between
maternal folate and neural tube defects (NTDs), the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandated that all
cereals and grains be enriched with 140 mg of folic acid per
100 g of product by January 1998 as part of a multifaceted
public health campaign to reduce the incidence of NTDs
(Food and Drug Administration, 1996; “Recommendations
for the Use of Folic Acid,” 1992). Pooled data from birth
defects registries across the United States demonstrate that
since the implementation of fortification, the prevalence of
anencephaly and spina bifida has declined by approximately
30%, and at least 1,300 NTD-affected births per year have
been prevented (Williams et al., 2015).
Popular “low-carb” diets may be counterproductive to
this success. The practice of restricting carbohydrates entails
abstaining from the very foods that are fortified with folic
acid, such as cereal, pasta, and bread. Indeed, adherence to
low-carbohydrate diets is associated with lower than recom-
mended intake of several micronutrients including folic acid
(Freedman, King, & Kennedy, 2001).

 We hypothesized that some women who restrict carbohy-
drates may have suboptimal folate status and subsequently may
be at higher risk of having an NTD-affected pregnancy. In this
study, we investigated whether maternal carbohydrate restriction
before conception was associated with spina bifida or anence-
phaly in a large, population-based study of birth defects.

METHODS
2.1
|
Study population
All study data are from the National Birth Defects Prevention
Study (NBDPS), a multicenter case-control study of major
structural birth defects. Details of the NBDPS design are pub-
lished (Reefhuis et al., 2015). In brief, nine Centers for Birth
Defects Research and Prevention sponsored by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recruited partici-
pants with an expected delivery date (EDD) between October
1997 and December 2011 among residents of either the entire
state (Arkansas, Iowa, and Utah) or well-defined geographic
study areas (California, Georgia, Massachusetts, North Caro-
lina, New York, and Texas). Cases were live births, stillbirths
(�20 weeks), and prenatally diagnosed terminations with at
least one eligible birth defect. Controls were live births with-
out a birth defect and were randomly sampled using birth cer-
tificates or hospital records from the same population as cases
in each state. Pregnancies included in this analysis were con-
ceived on or after April 1, 1998, which is 3 months following
the FDA’s deadline for fortification of eligible foodstuffs.

Case ascertainment and classification
Each center’s birth defects surveillance registry employed
active case ascertainment strategies to identify cases of
NTDs diagnosed up to one year after delivery by physical
examination, imaging, surgery, or autopsy. A clinical geneti-
cist at each center reviewed abstracted medical records to
determine study eligibility. Subsequent to enrollment in
NBDPS, each case received a secondary review by a team of
clinical geneticists to provide systematic, study-wide classifi-
cation (Rasmussen et al., 2003). Infants with chromosomal
abnormalities, recognized single-gene disorders, or terato-
genic syndromes were excluded. Cases were classified as
isolated if only one major structural defect was present, or if
co-occurring defects were anatomically or pathogenetically
related; otherwise, cases with multiple unrelated structural
defects were classified as nonisolated. In this analysis, the
outcome “NTDs” refers to two mutually exclusive sub-
groups: (1) anencephaly and (2) spina bifida. Per NBDPS
classification protocol, cases of anencephaly may have co-
occurring cranioraschischisis, encephalocele, or spina bifida,
whereas cases classified as spina bifida do not have another
co-occurring NTD.

Maternal interviews
Within 6 weeks to 24 months from the EDD, mothers partici-
pated in a structured hour-long telephone interview to collect
information about demographics, medical history, and life-
style behaviors. Among all NTD cases eligible for the
NBDPS, approximately 66% of mothers participated in the
interview (64% of controls), and the average age at interview
was 10 months (9 months for controls).

Carbohydrate and dietary folate intake
During the maternal interview, usual consumption of foods in
the year before pregnancy was ascertained using a modified
58-item food frequency questionnaire with additional ques-
tions about cereal consumption within 3 months of conception
(Willet et al., 1987). Carbohydrate (grams/day) and folate
(micrograms/day) intake from food and nonalcoholic bever-
ages including soft drinks were obtained using the USDA
National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Version
27, which provides values for essential nutrients and other die-
tary components for thousands of individual food items based
on laboratory composition analysis (Pehrsson, Patterson, Hay-
towitz, & Phillips, 2015; USDA Agricultural Research Serv-
ice, 2007). We examined two measures of maternal dietary
folate intake: folic acid and total folate. Dietary folic acid
intake reflects the estimated measure of synthetic folic acid
consumed through fortified foods, regardless of consumption
of foods with naturally occurring folate (green vegetables,
legumes, etc.). Total dietary folate intake was expressed as
dietary folate equivalents (DFE), which is the sum of synthetic
folic acid plus natural folate, weighted by folic acid to account
for its enhanced bioavailability. During the interview, we also
obtained information about the timing and frequency of use of
prenatal vitamins or multivitamins containing folic acid.
The observed distribution of carbohydrate intake was
used to determine a reasonable definition of “restricted”
intake which resulted in a sufficient number of exposed cases
for analysis and also generally aligned with most low carbo-
hydrate diets’ recommended target of <100 g/day (Freedman
et al., 2001). Subsequently, we defined restricted carbohy-
drate intake as daily intake �5th percentile among controls
mothers, which corresponds to approximately 95 g/day.

Statistical analysis
We examined characteristics of mothers with restricted
carbohydrate intake (�5th percentile) compared to mothers
with nonrestricted intake (>5th percentile) among controls;
bivariate comparisons were assessed using chi-square tests.

 periconceptional smoking or alcohol use, folic acid supple-
ment use, pregnancy intention, number of previous pregnan-
cies, and study center. To explore the relationship between
carbohydrate and folate intake in these data, we compared
mean intake of folic acid and total dietary folate among con-
trols with and without restricted carbohydrate intake.
We examined the association between restricted carbohy-
drate intake and NTDs using logistic regression to estimate
odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and
explored potential effect measure modification in stratified
analyses by folic acid supplement use, pre-pregnancy BMI,
and pregnancy intention. Models were ultimately adjusted
for covariates identified as potential confounders in a
directed acyclic graph that also resulted in �10% change in
the magnitude of the ORs. We further adjusted for caloric
intake to account for potential residual confounding by
energy intake. To visualize potential deviations from linearity
in the association between NTDs and carbohydrate intake,
we developed tail-restricted cubic splines with knots at the
5th, 25th, 75th, and 95th percentiles of carbohydrate intake
among controls.
Mothers were excluded from analyses if they had nonsin-
gleton pregnancies (5.3% cases; 2.7% controls), pregesta-
tional Type I or Type II diabetes (2.1% cases; 1.4% controls),
or had used a donor egg/embryo (<1% cases; <1% controls).
Also excluded were mothers missing �2 items on the FFQ
(3.8% cases; 4.4% controls) or who reported extreme caloric
intake <500 or >5,000 kcal (5.3% cases; 5.5% controls).
To explore the potential influence of specific characteris-
tics of our study population, we repeated analyses excluding
mothers with a first-degree family history of NTDs, mothers
who used medications classified as folic acid antagonists,
and mothers who reported using food supplements like nutri-
tional shakes. Because some centers initiated case ascertain-
ment among elective terminations after the start of the study
period, we also repeated analyses restricting to only centers
and study years with complete case ascertainment. Analyses
were performed using SAS statistical software, version 9.3
(SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). The NBDPS was approved
by the IRB at CDC and at each participating center.

RESULTS
We analyzed data from 9,543 controls and 1,559 cases,
including 516 cases of anencephaly (461 isolated) and 1,043
cases of spina bifida (926 isolated). Among cases of anence-
phaly, 30.4% were live births, 23.5% stillbirths, and 46.1%
terminations. Among cases of spina bifida, 87.5% were live
births, 2.4% stillbirths, and 10.1% terminations. Maternal
demographic and pregnancy characteristics by case/control
status are presented in Supporting Information Table 1.
Compared to women with nonrestricted carbohydrate
intake, women with restricted intake were more likely to be
older, non-Hispanic white, born in the United States, have
more years of education, and have higher household income
(Table 1). They were also more likely to have consumed
alcohol in early pregnancy, and to have planned their preg-
nancy. There were no differences in BMI, smoking, prenatal
vitamin, and/or folic acid supplement use, or number of pre-
vious pregnancies. Some variation by study center was
observed: for example, women with restricted carbohydrate
intake were more likely to live in New York or Massachu-
setts, and less likely to live in Texas or California. The aver-
age estimated daily intake of folic acid and total dietary folate
among women with restricted carbohydrate intake was less
than half that of women with nonrestricted intake (p < .01).
After adjusting for maternal race/ethnicity, education,
alcohol use, folic acid supplement use, and study center,
women with restricted carbohydrate intake were 41% more
likely to have an NTD-affected pregnancy (95% CI 5 1.11,
1.79) (Table 2). Further adjustment by energy intake slightly
attenuated the association (OR 5 1.30, 95% CI 5 1.02, 1.67),
with no appreciable difference in the magnitude of the asso-
ciation between anencephaly (OR 5 1.35, 95% CI 5 0.90,
2.02) and spina bifida (OR 5 1.28, 95% CI 5 0.95, 1.72).
The fully adjusted OR for any nonisolated NTD was 1.93
(95% CI 5 1.03, 3.60) compared to 1.25 (95% CI 5 0.95,
1.61) for isolated NTDs (Table 3). This pattern of higher
ORs among cases with multiple defects was consistent for
anencephaly and spina bifida; however, confidence intervals
overlapped considerably.
Figure 1 illustrates that in these data, as daily carbohy-
drate intake decreases, the association with NTDs increases
in magnitude. The association appears to be limited to
reduced carbohydrate intake only, as ORs for intake above
the median were consistent with null.
We observed no effect measure modification by folic
acid supplement use or BMI. However, effect estimates
stratified by pregnancy intention were notably divergent:
restricted carbohydrate intake was associated with NTDs
among unplanned pregnancies (OR 5 1.89, 95% CI 5 1.28,
2.79) but not among planned pregnancies (OR 5 0.87, 95%
CI 5 0.59, 1.29). Exclusion of mothers with a family history
of NTDs, mothers who used folic acid antagonists, and
mothers who used food supplements did not change the
results, nor did restriction to centers and years with full case
ascertainment among nonlive births (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
Despite the success of the FDA’s fortification program in
reducing the prevalence of NTDs, more than 20% of women
of childbearing age still have red blood cell (RBC) folate

 concentrations that are insufficient to attenuate the risk of
folic acid-sensitive NTDs at a population level (Tinker,
Hamner, Qi, & Crider, 2015). Further research is needed to
elucidate the underlying determinants of folate insufficiency
in this high-risk group, which are likely multifactorial rang-
ing from genetics to dietary patterns (Hamner & Tinker,
2014; Tsang et al., 2015). The popularization of low carbo-
hydrate diets could also be a contributing factor as fortified
foods are frequently high-carbohydrate foods (Blanck et al.,
2006; Quinlivan & Gregory, 2007). In this study, we found
that restricted carbohydrate intake before conception is asso-
ciated with a significant reduction in dietary folic acid and
total folate intake, and a moderate increase in the risk of
anencephaly and spina bifida, particularly among infants
with nonisolated NTDs, and particularly among women with
unplanned pregnancies. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to investigate the potential effect of maternal carbohy-
drate restriction on NTD risk.
Given our initial hypothesis, we expected to observe evi-
dence of modification by folic acid supplement use, whereby

 the odds of having an NTD-affected pregnancy would be
attenuated among women using supplements. However, the
proportion of women in our study that reported supplement
use in the month before conception was the same among
women with restricted and nonrestricted carbohydrate intake
(�31%), and the association with NTDs was not modified by
supplement use. One possible explanation is that for some
women, supplementation does not sufficiently compensate
for the folate deficit due to extreme carbohydrate restriction,
perhaps because the dosage is lower than the recommended
400–800 mg/day, or because of inconsistent use. Indeed,
recent NHANES data show that approximately 10% of
women who report using supplements still have RBC folate
concentrations associated with elevated risk for NTDs (Tin-
ker et al., 2015). It is also possible that maternal recall error
in the timing or frequency of supplement use led to misclas-
sification. An analysis of maternal folate and NTDs con-
ducted in a subset of our study population (1998–2003)
found no difference in mean dietary folic acid or total folate
between NTD cases and controls, and no association

effect” by which folate status in the majority of women in
the general population has reached levels at which nearly all
folate-sensitive NTDs are prevented (Mosley et al., 2009).
An alternative interpretation of our results is that the
observed association between restricted carbohydrate intake
and NTDs is mediated at least in part by caloric restriction or
poor diet quality in general, which have been previously
associated with NTDs (Carmichael, Shaw, Schaffer, Laurent,
& Selvin, 2003; Carmichael, Yang, & Feldkamp, 2012;
Sotres-Alvarez et al., 2013; Suarez, Felkner, Brender, &
Canfield, 2012). A California study of NTD-affected infants
conceived prior to folic acid fortification found that dieting
to lose weight during the first trimester was associated with a
doubling of risk of NTDs, whereas dieting to lose weight
within 3 months of conception was not associated with
NTDs (Carmichael et al., 2003). Mothers who reported any
dieting behaviors during pregnancy also had lower mean die-
tary intakes of folic acid than women who reported no diet-
ing. A more recent study of dieting among Mexican-
American women in Texas found the same doubling in NTD
risk, although in this study an association was observed for
women who reported dieting to lose weight within 3 months
before conception (Suarez et al., 2012). Neither the Califor-
nia nor the Texas study assessed carbohydrate restriction as a
specific dieting approach. In addition, neither study assessed
the potential effect of food restriction independent of desired
weight loss. Thus, our study offers a different angle as we
assessed carbohydrate restriction regardless of weight loss
intent. In NBDPS, questions about intentional weight loss
during pregnancy were added to the interview in 2005.
Among the subset of our sample for whom we had informa-
tion on dieting behaviors (46%), women with restricted car-
bohydrate intake were not more likely than other women to
report “trying to lose weight” (19% vs. 18%) or “avoiding
calories, fat, or carbs” (13% vs. 11%). We do not know the
proportion of women avoiding carbohydrates exclusively, as
the questionnaire asked about “calories, fat, and carbs” com-
bined. However, the observation that women with restricted
carbohydrate intake in our study were not any more likely to
be dieting suggests that “low carb” may be generally per-
ceived as a desirable or healthy dietary pattern and not just a
weight loss strategy. A recent national Gallup survey of die-
tary habits provides further evidence of carbohydrate reduc-
tion becoming a mainstream dietary pattern: the proportion
of respondents who reported “actively avoiding carbohy-
drates” increased from approximately 20% in 2002 to 30% in
2014, and almost a quarter of respondents who were not
actively trying to lose weight still reported avoiding carbohy-
drates on a daily basis (Dugan, 2014). Although we cannot
identify women in our study who were intentionally practic-
ing a “low carb” diet (or indirectly avoiding carbohydrates
via a gluten-free diet), examining those with reduced carbo-
hydrate intake relative to the rest of the study population
may be a sufficiently informative contrast if people are
increasingly avoiding carbohydrates regardless of whether
they are actively trying to lose weight.
Low carbohydrate diets are also clinically indicated for
patients diagnosed with Type II diabetes (Feinman et al.,
2015). Given that pregestational diabetes and obesity are
both established risk factors for NTDs (Carmichael, Rasmus-
sen, & Shaw, 2010; Ornoy, Reece, Pavlinkova, Kappen, &
Miller, 2015), we excluded women with Type I or II diabe-
tes, and we assessed but found no evidence of effect measure
modification or confounding by BMI. While diabetes and
obesity do not appear to explain the observed increase in
NTDs in our data, we cannot rule out residual confounding
as both diabetes and pre-pregnancy weight and height were
self-reported.
An important limitation of our case-control study is that
we lacked biospecimens collected during pregnancy. There-
fore, we cannot directly assess the association between car-
bohydrate intake and RBC folate concentrations, nor can we
assess the degree to which the association between NTDs
and restricted carbohydrate intake is mediated by low folate
status versus other pathways. Although we found that dietary
folate intake was significantly reduced among women with
restricted carbohydrate intake, this finding is exploratory as
our measures of carbohydrates and folic acid are not inde-
pendent in that they both come from the same reported
foods. As nutrient intakes were estimated based on self-
reported

 abbreviated FFQ, we further caution against interpreting the
estimated nutrient values in this study as absolute values; we
cannot assume, for example, that all women classified in our
study as having restricted carbohydrate intake actually con-
sumed fewer than 95 g/day. Another limitation is that the
FFQ captured usual diet in the year before conception, and
the extent to which diets may have differed around the time
of conception or during the first few weeks of pregnancy is
unknown. However, usual diet in the year before conception
is likely to reflect diet during the embryologic period of neu-
ral tube development which occurs often before pregnancy
recognition as well as before pregnancy-related nausea and
vomiting that can prompt changes in usual diet. One group
who may have changed their usual diet around the time of
conception is pregnancy planners. In our data, the association
between restricted carbohydrate intake and NTDs was
observed only among women with unintended pregnancies.
We speculate this could be because women who intended to
get pregnant made positive changes to their diet or began
consistently taking the recommended dose of folic acid sup-
plement (Dott, Rasmussen, Hogue, Reefhuis, & National
Birth Defects Prevention Study, 2010).
The NBDPS provided a unique opportunity to examine
this novel research question in a large, well-classified, popu-
lation-based case group accrued over a postfortification study
period of over 10 years. Ascertainment of cases among still-
births and terminations is an important strength of our study
as a large proportion of NTD-affected pregnancies do not
survive to live birth. In addition, the maternal interview pro-
vides essential information on potential confounders and
other important factors such as the timing and frequency of
folic acid supplement use.

CONCLUSION
In summary, we found that restricted carbohydrate intake in
the year before conception is associated with a moderate
increase in the odds of anencephaly and spina bifida. Neither
BMI nor folic acid supplement use modified the observed
association,
but
a
stronger
association
was
noted
for
unplanned pregnancies and for infants with multiple birth
defects. Our next steps include an examination of the relation
between carbohydrate intake and RBC folate concentrations
in a national sample. Given the sustained popularity of low
carbohydrate diets, we advise maternal health care providers
to be aware of their patients’ dietary practices and the poten-
tial for folate insufficiency among women practicing carbohy-
drate restriction.
