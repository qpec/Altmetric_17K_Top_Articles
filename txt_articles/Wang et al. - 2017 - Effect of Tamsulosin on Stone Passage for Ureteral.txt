Study objective: Tamsulosin is recommended for patients receiving a diagnosis of a ureteral stone less than 10 mm
who do not require immediate urologic intervention. Because of conflicting results from recent meta-analyses and large
randomized controlled trials, the efficacy of tamsulosin is unclear. We perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to
investigate the effect of tamsulosin on stone passage in patients receiving a diagnosis of ureteral stone.
Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases were searched without language restriction through November
2015 for studies assessing the efficacy of tamsulosin and using a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial design.
Meta-analysis was conducted with a random-effects model and subgroup analyses were conducted to determine
sources of heterogeneity.
Results: Eight randomized controlled trials (N¼1,384) contained sufficient information for inclusion. The pooled risk of
stone passage in the tamsulosin arm was 85% versus 66% in the placebo arm, but substantial heterogeneity existed
across trials (I2¼80.2%; P<.001). After stratifying of studies by stone size, the meta-analysis of the large stone
subgroup (5 to 10 mm; N¼514) indicated a benefit of tamsulosin (risk difference¼22%; 95% confidence interval 12% to
33%; number needed to treat¼5). The meta-analysis of the small stone subgroup (<4 to 5 mm; N¼533) indicated no
benefit (risk difference¼–0.3%; 95% confidence interval –4% to 3%). Neither meta-analysis for the occurrence of
dizziness or hypotension showed a significant effect.
Conclusion: Tamsulosin significantly improves stone passage in patients with larger stones, whereas the effect of
tamsulosin is diminished in those with smaller stones, who are likely to pass their stone regardless of treatment. [Ann

INTRODUCTION
Background
Patients receiving a diagnosis of ureteral stones less than
10 mm who do not require immediate urologic
intervention are observed for stone passage.1,2 Medical
expulsive therapy, including a-blockers, steroids, and
calcium channel blockers, has been extensively studied as
an adjunct to observation, potentially benefiting patients by
facilitating stone passage and decreasing the need for
urologic intervention. In accordance with the results of
numerous randomized controlled trials and meta-
analyses,3-5 the American Urologic Association and
European Association of Urology have recommended that
patients with ureteral stones less than 10 mm be followed
for stone passage and receive an appropriate medical
therapy.1,6 A recent Cochrane review of a-blockers,
including 32 randomized trials of 5,684 participants,
reported a significant improvement in stone passage.7
However, the majority of trials included in this study were
not placebo controlled and blinded and were considered at
moderate to high risk of bias; only 7 of 32 trials were
doubled blinded. Two subsequent multicenter randomized
placebo-controlled trials did not show a significant benefit
of tamsulosin, except in the most recent randomized trial,
which suggested a benefit in a subgroup with larger stones
(5 to 10 mm).8,9 These conflicting results have led to
considerable uncertainty in regard to the efficacy of
tamsulosin for increasing the passage of ureteral stones.
The efficacy of tamsulosin is important to elucidate.7
Urolithiasis is a common disorder because 1 in 11 persons
in the United States experiences stone disease in his or her
lifetime.10 It is estimated there are now more than 2
million annual outpatient visits for urolithiasis in the
United States.11 Although urologists have been proponents

GENERAL MEDICINE/SYSTEMATIC REVIEW/META-ANALYSIS
 Editor’s Capsule Summary
What is already known on this topic
There is contradictory evidence about the value of
tamsulosin for ureteral stones.
What question this study addressed
Do differences in stone size explain conflicting trial
results?
What this study adds to our knowledge
This meta-analysis of 8 trials and 1,384 patients
found no improvement in stone passage from
tamsulosin in the subset with smaller stones (<5
mm) but benefit in those with larger stones (number
needed to treat 5).
How this is relevant to clinical practice
Tamsulosin is beneficial for larger (5 to 10 mm)
ureteral stones only.
of a-blocker use, other clinicians who manage urolithiasis
have used a-blockers at low rates.11,12 A clear
understanding of the value of tamsulosin would help
clinicians to decide whether to offer this therapy to patients
with a common, recurrent, painful, and costly problem.
We chose to focus on tamsulosin because it is the most
frequently studied a-blocker, recommended in urology
treatment guidelines, and, in our experience, the most
common medical expulsive therapy used by emergency
physicians.6,7
Goals of This Investigation
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to
determine the effect of tamsulosin on stone passage in
adults receiving a diagnosis of ureteral stones. We sought to
overcome the limitations of previous meta-analyses by
including only randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trials. We also conducted a subgroup analysis
(stone size <5 versus 5 to 10 mm) to determine whether
stone size modifies the effect of tamsulosin, as suggested by
the latest trial.9 This study will clarify the role of tamsulosin
in patients receiving a diagnosis of ureteral stones less than
10 mm that do not require urgent intervention.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The protocol for this systematic review and meta-
analysis is available on the Prospero Web site (http://www.
crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/). Our study conforms to the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses statement for systematic reviews.13 With the
assistance of a medical librarian (E.W.), a search of
MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases to
include citations from January 1966 to November 2015,
limited to human subjects and without a language
restriction, was undertaken. Abstracts were included in the
search. Details of the search strategy are shown in
Figure E1, available online at http://www.annemergmed.
com. We reviewed bibliographies of identified studies and
review articles and consulted with topic experts to identify
additional studies not retrieved by the electronic search.
Two reviewers (R.C.W. and J.F.) independently
screened titles and abstracts of all articles identified by the
search. Disagreements between the reviewers concerning
the decision to include or exclude a study were resolved by
consensus and, if necessary, consultation with a third
author (M.L.S.). The following eligibility criteria were used
to select articles for this systematic review and meta-
analysis: randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind
trials that assessed the effect of tamsulosin on stone passage
among adult patients with radiographically confirmed
ureteral stones of 10 mm or less. Studies were excluded if
they did not provide a description of randomization, use of
a placebo, or blinding; if tamsulosin was not compared
with placebo; if stone passage was not measured; and if they
examined posturologic interventions for stones (such as
lithotripsy or ureteral stent placement). Studies were also
excluded from the meta-analysis if correspondence with
authors failed to provide data that would be amenable to
pooling. The full texts of potentially relevant studies were
then reviewed for articles meeting inclusion criteria. A final
roster of included studies was identified through reviewer
consensus. The 2 reviewers then independently abstracted
data from the included studies. The agreement between
reviewers for study inclusion was assessed with Cohen’s k.
Two investigators (R.C.W. and J.F.) independently
abstracted data from the included articles. The Cochrane
Group collection form for interventional reviews was used
for data abstraction. The information extracted included
trial name, year of publication, number and country of
centers, recruitment period, number of patients in each
treatment group, details about trial design (randomization,
blinding, and allocation concealment), eligibility criteria,
intervention, control therapy, baseline patient
demographics, efficacy outcomes (stone passage), length of
follow-up, safety outcomes (dizziness and postural
hypotension), and outcomes among relevant subgroups of
patients (small versus large stone size).
Two investigators (R.C.W. and J.F.) independently
performed quality assessment. We used the Cochrane
Collaboration’s tool to assess the risk of selection,

 performance, detection, attrition, and reporting biases
among the included randomized trials.14 In instances in
which data were not readily available or clear in the studies,
we contacted corresponding authors to gain clarification. If
studies were found to be at high risk of bias, meta-analyses
stratified by study quality could be performed.
Data Collection and Processing and Primary Data
Analysis
Pooled risk differences with corresponding 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) for each outcome of interest were
calculated. The main outcome was the risk difference in
stone passage after at least 3 weeks of observation. The risk
of stone passage was defined as the ratio of the frequency of
patients who were found to be stone free on follow-up to
the total group of subjects in each study arm. Participants
were considered to be stone free if they had a ureteral stone
at baseline and no stone on follow-up computed
tomography (CT) or kidney, ureter, and bladder
radiographs. The secondary outcome was the risk difference
in the 2 main adverse effects: self-reported dizziness and
postural hypotension. The number needed to treat was
calculated as the inverse of the risk difference in stone
passage.
We conducted a subgroup analysis based on previous
evidence suggesting that stone size (measured at the initial
visit) is an important determinant of stone passage.6,9,15
Furthermore, a recently published trial suggested that
patients with large stones (5 to 10 mm) benefited from
tamsulosin, whereas those with smaller stones (<5mm) did
not.9 We hypothesized that stone size modified the effect of
tamsulosin and accounted for between-study heterogeneity,
or could help resolve discrepancies between “negative-
result” multicenter trials and previous meta-analyses.16
Thus, we sought to conduct a prespecified analysis
comparing the effect of tamsulosin in a small-stone (<5
mm) versus large-stone (5 to 10 mm) subgroup. We used
the same outcome definitions of stone passage and time to
stone passage for these subgroup analyses. Time to stone
passage was not reported because this outcome is subjective
and was not measured precisely or uniformly in the
included studies.
Publication bias was explored with the use of funnel
plots, the Egger regression asymmetry test, and the Beggs
adjusted rank correlation test. For all meta-analyses,
outcomes were pooled with the DerSimonian and Laird
random-effects model, with weights calculated by the
inverse variance method to control for heterogeneity.
Heterogeneity in the summary statistics were assessed by
the c2 test statistic and expressed as the I2 statistic.
Individual study authors were contacted for updated or
individual patient data, but none were made available. All
analyses were performed with Stata (version 13; StataCorp,
College Station, TX).
RESULTS
Using the search terms, the search strategy yielded 991
references with potential relevance (Figure 1). After
removal of duplicate records, 732 references underwent
review of title and abstract, yielding 19 potentially relevant
references, which were reviewed in full. Five studies were
duplicates, 5 did not contain sufficient data to analyze in a
meta-analysis, and 1 reported 1-week outcomes (versus 3-
to 4-week outcomes). Authors for 7 studies were contacted
for additional information,8,17-22 and complete data were
available in only 8 cases. Agreement between study
abstractors was excellent (Cohen’s k¼0.94 [95% CI 0.82
to 1.0]). The 8 studies included in the systematic review are
shown in Table 1, comprising 1,384 participants. Included
trials and patient characteristics are also displayed. Among
the 8 placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized trials
of tamsulosin in patients with ureteral stones, only 1
included ureteral stones of all locations,8 whereas the
remaining studies included distal ureteral stones identified
by CT or kidney, ureter, and bladder radiographs. Four
studies were conducted in an emergency department (ED)
setting,8,9,19,23 and 4 were conducted in urology clinics in a
number of different countries,17,18,21,24 including
Australia, Egypt, France, India, Qatar, Switzerland, the
United Kingdom, and the United States.
Tamsulosin 0.4-mg pills were used as the intervention in
all trials. Six trials provided tamsulosin for 28 days, 1
provided the drug for 21 days,21 and the remaining study
provided tamsulosin for 42 days.23 The control group in
each study received a placebo pill.
The main outcome of all included studies was
stone passage, also referred to as “stone clearance” or
“stone-free rate.” In 7 of the 8 studies, this outcome was
defined as the absence of a ureteral stone on imaging,
either CT or kidney, ureter, and bladder radiographs, at
the end of the study period (after a stone was visualized
on baseline imaging). In 1 study, stone passage was
defined as the absence of urologic intervention.8 We
used results from 28 days whenever possible to avoid
heterogeneity.
The risk of bias for each study is described in Table E1,
available online at http://www.annemergmed.com. All
of the 8 studies were found to be at low risk of bias; 1
study was initially found to be at moderate risk of bias
because of lack of description of blinding and allocation
concealment in the published article.18 However, we
chose to include this study because contact with the

 author confirmed that the study was, in fact, placebo
controlled and double blinded. Four of the 8 studies
were found to have an unclear risk of attrition bias
because participants who were lost to follow-up were
excluded from the final analyses.
The percentage of participants who experienced stone
passage for tamsulosin and placebo cohorts is shown in
Table 2. The pooled risk of stone passage in the tamsulosin
arm was 85%; in the placebo arm, 66%. In the primary
meta-analysis including 8 studies, tamsulosin resulted in
increased stone passage (risk difference¼17%; 95% CI 6%
to 27%). However, the I2 statistic was 80.2% (P<.001),
indicating substantial heterogeneity. A forest plot of all
studies sorted by stone size can be found in Figure E2
(available online at http://www.annemergmed.com),
suggesting that this heterogeneity can in part be explained
by differences in stone size.
In a preplanned subgroup analysis, the pooled estimate
for stone passage in the subgroup of patients with large
stones (minimum stone size of 4 mm) was calculated. Six
of the 8 studies reported outcomes for a larger stone
subgroup; however, the definition of stone size varied from

 study to study because some studies used a cutoff of 4 mm,
whereas others used 5 mm. Two studies exclusively
enrolled participants with a minimum stone size of 4
mm.17,24 Large stone size definitions are listed in Figure 2.
In the subgroup meta-analysis of large stone size, the I2
statistic was 33.1% (P¼.19), with an RD in stone passage
of 22% (95% CI 12% to 33%), or a number needed to
treat¼5. In the subgroup meta-analysis of small stone size
(maximum stone size 5kmm), the I2 statistic was 0%
(P¼.43), with an RD in stone passage of –0.03% (95% CI
–3.9% to 3.3%), suggesting no benefit from tamsulosin on
stone passage in patients with smaller stones. However, this
subgroup meta-analysis is limited to only 4 studies in which
data for small stones were available.
The percentage of participants who experienced
dizziness for the tamsulosin and placebo cohorts is shown
in Table 3. The pooled analysis included 8 studies with an
I2¼¼67.8% (P¼.003), and the RD for the occurrence of
dizziness¼0.2% (95% CI –2.1% to 2.5%).
For orthostatic hypotension, the pooled analysis
included 8 studies with an I2 statistic¼0% (P¼.54), and
the RD for postural hypotension¼0.1% (95% CI –0.4%
to 0.5%). Neither analysis identified a significant difference
in either harm-related outcome between the tamsulosin and
placebo cohorts.
Visual inspection of the funnel plot did demonstrate
asymmetry (Table E2, available online at http://www.

 publication bias when data were analyzed by Egger’s test
(P¼.02), but not the Beggs test.
LIMITATIONS
We chose to include randomized, placebo-controlled,
blinded trials of tamsulosin. In accordance with visual
inspection of the funnel plot (Figure E3, available online at
http://www.annemergmed.com), as well as Egger’s test, we
found evidence to suggest publication bias. It is possible
that negative-result small studies were not published. To
minimize this bias, abstracts were searched, and several
authors were contacted. Ultimately, we did not uncover
any unpublished reports of high enough quality to permit
inclusion in this meta-analysis.
All of the studies enrolled subjects according to the
presence of a ureteral stone on CT or kidney, ureter, and
bladder radiographs. This eligibility criterion differs from
that of current practice because not all patients receiving a

 diagnosis of urolithiasis undergo CT or kidney, ureter, and
bladder imaging.11 Seven of 8 studies enrolled only patients
with distal ureteral stones, and the remaining study
included ureteral stones located in the proximal or
midureter.8 Thus, we were unable to conduct a meta-
analysis of nondistal studies. The majority of stones are
thought to be found in the distal ureter because distal
stones composed 65% of all ureteral stones in the
aforementioned large multicenter trial.8 Proximal stones
may continue to descend and become distal stones, and as
such, there may be an ultimate benefit to tamsulosin during
a longer period of observation. Similarly, all studies
excluded stones measuring more than 10 mm. Experts
recommend urologic intervention in these patients;
however, it is possible that passage of even these very large
stones can be facilitated by tamsulosin. Management of
these patients should include consultation with a urologist.
Previous reviews of randomized trials have shown
inconsistencies in the reporting of harms-related
outcomes.25,26 There is substantial heterogeneity in the
reported incidence of dizziness, with some studies reporting
20% of both cohorts experiencing dizziness and several
other studies reporting no harm-related events.17,18,24,27
Also, no included studies calculated the power to detect
differences in adverse effects. These limitations should be
taken into account when the reliability of the dizziness and
postural hypotension findings is considered, even when
combined in a meta-analysis.
Substantial heterogeneity was identified in our main
analysis, calling into question the reliability of a single
pooled estimate with all studies. This heterogeneity likely
stemmed from variation in clinical settings (ED versus
outpatient urology office), study populations, inclusion
criteria, follow-up assessment, and outcome measurements.
We sought to control for heterogeneity between studies by
using a random-effects model and also conducted a
subgroup analysis based on stone size, which explains a
portion of the heterogeneity that was encountered.
DISCUSSION
In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 8 randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, we found that
tamsulosin improves stone passage in a subgroup of
participants with large distal ureteral stones. In patients with
a confirmed distal ureteral stone from 5 to 10 mm, a trial of
tamsulosin 0.4 mg once daily for 28 days or until stone
passage is likely to improve stone passage. In these patients,
the number needed to treat for tamsulosin to induce 1
patient to pass a stone who otherwise would not have may be
as low as 3 or as high as 8. The subgroup analysis of
participants with smaller stones was limited to 4 studies,
which did not suggest a significant effect. This diminished
effect in patients with smaller stones may be explained by the
overall high likelihood of stone passage because more than
80% of those with a stone less than 5 mm experienced
spontaneous stone passage in the placebo arm.
The results of our meta-analysis suggest an explanation
for the discrepancies between previous meta-analyses and
the recent large multicenter pragmatic trial by Pickard
et al.8 The authors of this randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, pragmatic, multicenter trial reported a
lack of benefit of tamsulosin for patients with ureteral
stones up to 10 mm. The discrepancies between this well-
conducted trial and our meta-analysis are likely due to
differing inclusion criteria and stone sizes. Pickard et al8
included participants with ureteral stones of all locations
(proximal, midureter, and distal), whereas the 7 remaining
trials in this meta-analysis included only those with distal
stones. Thus, we chose to include the authors’ distal
ureteral stone subgroup, which appeared to show a weak
trend toward a benefit in the tamsulosin arm (RD¼5%;
95% CI –2% to 11%). We believe that the subgroup of
participants with large, distal stones from the study by
Pickard et al8 would have shown a significant improvement
in stone passage, but we were unable to obtain the
additional data required. After ongoing correspondence and
unsuccessful requests for data from Pickard, we ultimately
elected to use the best available results in the published
article for the purposes of pooling data. Thus, we used large
stones of all locations in the large stone subgroup analysis.
We believe the subgroup analysis based on stone size
identified in this meta-analysis is likely to be valid. This
subgroup analysis is suggested by a previous study, in which
tamsulosin improved stone passage in large stones (5 to 10
mm), but not in smaller ones (<5 mm).11 The role of stone
size as a modifier of the effect of tamsulosin on stone passage
is biologically plausible because stone size is a known
predictor of stone passage. Small stones have a high rate of
passage, whereas large ones are less likely to pass, and it
seems logical that tamsulosin mainly benefits patients with
more recalcitrant stones. The effect of stone size is consistent
across the 4 studies that included both small and large
subgroups because tamsulosin is associated with a benefit
in the large stone subgroups and not in the small stone
subgroup.8,9,21,27 Chance alone is unlikely to explain the
difference in the effect of tamsulosin because the 95% CIs of
the effect on small versus large subgroups do not overlap.
We updated the Cochrane review of a-blockers, which
included studies up to 2012. This review concluded that
the use of tamsulosin in patients with ureteral stones results
in a higher stone-free rate (relative risk 1.48; 95% CI 1.32
to 1.67) compared with standard therapy. In contrast to the

 Cochrane review, our main finding suggests that
tamsulosin is efficacious in patients with larger stones
(relative risk 1.36; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.56) and not with
smaller ones. This difference is likely due to our inclusion
of blinded placebo-controlled trials, whereas the Cochrane
review included 24 small, single-center trials, the majority
of which (19/24) did not describe use of a placebo and
blinding. Additionally, 2 recent multicenter studies not
included in the Cochrane review were included in our
updated meta-analysis.
Tamsulosin did not appear to increase the incidence of
dizziness or orthostatic hypotension in the included studies.
These results differ from those of the most recent previous
meta-analysis, in which the adverse events were combined.
Patients who received an a-blocker were 2.7 times more
likely to experience a number of adverse events, such as
dizziness, palpitations, headache, rhinitis, retrograde
ejaculation, and fatigue.7 In addition, a large observational
study found a significant association between tamsulosin use
and hypotension necessitating hospital admission in patients
with a mean age of 62 years and with benign prostatic
hypertrophy.28 Our results differ, likely because of the
restriction to the most serious adverse events, dizziness and
orthostatic hypotension. In addition, we limited our analysis
to tamsulosin in placebo-controlled, blinded studies with a
low risk of bias. However, we would maintain caution when
prescribing tamsulosin because the results of our meta-
analysis were limited by substantial heterogeneity and likely
underpowered. The main exclusion criteria in the
randomized trials in regard to patient safety included
hypotension; concurrent a-, calcium channel, or beta-
blocker use; allergic reaction to a-blockers; and pregnancy.
In accordance with the findings of this study, we
strongly recommend the use of tamsulosin in patients
receiving a diagnosis of large distal ureteral stones (5 to 10
mm). Because of the different cutoffs used in the included
trials (4 versus 5 mm), the effect of tamsulosin is less certain
for patients with a 4-mm stone, but we believe that it could
be offered after a discussion with the patient about the risks
and benefits of treatment. For stones less than 4 mm, we
believe it is reasonable to avoid prescribing a likely
unnecessary medication but acknowledge that in some
circumstances (such as for patients who have previously
needed surgical intervention for small stones) clinicians
may choose to test a course of tamsulosin. Either course
would be reasonable initially because the benefit of
tamsulosin in this group of patients is likely to be modest, if
any, but the harms from the drug appear to be minimal.
This meta-analysis also provides evidence for clinicians
to discuss the likelihood of stone passage with their patients
because those receiving a diagnosis of ureteral stones are
often interested in knowing what to expect in regard to
stone passage after an initial ED visit. A previous
meta-analysis of 224 participants found that 68% of
ureteral stones less than or equal to 5 mm passed
spontaneously and 47% of those greater than 5 mm would
pass spontaneously.1 In our meta-analysis, we found that
the overall stone passage rate at 28 days for distal ureteral
stones in the placebo arm (694 participants) was 64%, with
an 86% rate of stone passage in smaller stones (less than 4
to 5 mm) and 57% rate in patients with larger stones. It is
unclear why the rate of stone passage is higher in the
control group from our review. We believe that the method
of ascertaining the stone passage outcome in 7 of the 8
included studies—repeated imaging—is likely to be
accurate. Similarly, if administered tamsulosin, patients can
expect an 85% rate of stone passage for smaller stones and a
79% rate for larger stones.
In conclusion, there is strong evidence to suggest that
tamsulosin improves stone passage in patients with large
stones (5 to 10 mm), whereas the effect of tamsulosin is
unclear for those with stones less than 4 mm, who are likely
to pass their stone regardless of treatment.
