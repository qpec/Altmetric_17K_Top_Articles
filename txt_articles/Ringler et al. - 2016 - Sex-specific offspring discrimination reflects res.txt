Abstract
The ability to differentiate between one's own and foreign offspring ensures the exclusive 
allocation of costly parental care to only related progeny. The selective pressure to evolve 
offspring discrimination strategies is largely shaped by the likelihood and costs of offspring 
confusion. We hypothesize that males and females with different reproductive and spatial 
behaviours face different risks of confusing their own with others' offspring, and this should favour 
differential offspring discrimination strategies in the two sexes. In the brilliant-thighed poison 
frog, Allobates femoralis, males and females are highly polygamous, terrestrial clutches are laid in 
male territories and females abandon the clutch after oviposition. We investigated whether males 
and females differentiate between their own offspring and unrelated young, whether they use 
direct or indirect cues and whether the concurrent presence of their own clutch is essential to elicit 
parental behaviours. Males transported tadpoles regardless of location or parentage, but to a lesser 
extent in the absence of their own clutch. Females discriminated between clutches based on exact 
location and transported tadpoles only in the presence of their own clutch. This sex-specific 
selectivity of males and females during parental care reflects the differences in their respective 
costs of offspring confusion, resulting from differences in their spatial and reproductive 
behaviours.

In species with parental care, the ability to recognize and discriminate between one's own 
offspring and unrelated young can have considerable fitness consequences for both the 
caregiving parent and its progeny (Beecher, 1991; Sherman, Reeve, & Pfennig, 1997). As 
parental behaviours are often very costly, parents in noncooperatively breeding species

 should ensure that care is directed exclusively to their own progeny (Duckworth, Badyaev, & 
Parlow, 2003; Queller, 1997; Trivers, 1972; but see also Larsson, Tegelström, & Forslund, 
1995). Thus in several species males adjust the intensity of care according to the level of 
perceived paternity (bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus: Neff, 2003; eastern bluebirds, 
Sialia sialis: MacDougall-Shackleton & Robertson, 1998; pumpkinseed sunfish, Lepomis 
gibbosus: Rios-Cardenas & Webster, 2005; blue-footed boobies, Sula nebouxii: Osorio-
Beristain & Drummond, 2001; but see also Kempenaers, Lanctot, & Robertson, 1998).
Substantial fitness benefits of accurate offspring discrimination abilities can be expected 
particularly when the risk of misdirected care is high (i.e. the likelihood of mistaking 
unrelated for one's own offspring, Westneat & Sherman, 1993). This is the case, for 
example, when offspring are highly mobile, when foreign progeny are in close spatial 
proximity, under polygamy or when cuckoldry is common. Several mechanisms have been 
proposed to explain how parents may differentiate between their own offspring and 
unrelated young: recognition alleles, phenotype matching, assortative learning or spatial 
recognition (Komdeur & Hatchwell, 1999; Sherman et al., 1997). Discrimination 
mechanisms are also classified regarding the use of direct or indirect cues: direct recognition 
refers to parents recognizing specific phenotypic characteristics of their young (chemical: 
Head, Doughty, Blomberg, & Keogh, 2008; Neff, 2003; Neff & Sherman, 2005; acoustic: 
Knörnschild & Von Helversen, 2008; visual: Lahti & Lahti, 2002; Underwood & Sealy, 
2006); indirect recognition occurs if parents use contextual cues such as spatial location, 
frequency of encounters, larval age or external cues associated with an offspring's location 
(Bonadonna, Cunningham, Jouventin, Hesters, & Nevitt, 2003; Lank, Bousfield, Cooke, & 
Rockwell, 1991; Müller & Eggert, 1990; Waldman, 1987). Parents should follow the 
simplest set of rules to optimize costs and benefits between two kinds of possible errors in 
offspring recognition: (1) caring for unrelated progeny and (2) rejecting their own offspring 
as recipients of care (Trivers, 1974). For example, indirect rather than direct recognition is 
expected to evolve when offspring are not likely to move and are deposited in spatially 
discrete clusters or inside a parent's territory (Sherman et al., 1997; Waldman, 1987). Sex-
specific differences in spatial behaviours (e.g. territoriality versus high mobility) and/or 
reproductive strategies (e.g. choosing versus advertising sex, parental care versus offspring 
desertion) might thus favour different offspring discrimination strategies in males and 
females.
Behavioural differences between males and females are common features across most 
species and across social/environmental contexts. For example, several studies have 
demonstrated sex differences in species recognition abilities, probably resulting from the 
differential costs of mismating and hybridization or sex-specific risks of predation (Saetre, 
Král, & Bureš, 1997; Svensson, Karlsson, Friberg, & Eroukhmanoff, 2007). Regarding 
offspring discrimination, sex differences have been shown in the razorbill, Alca torda, in 
which care by each parent takes place at different stages of offspring development (Insley, 
Paredes, & Jones, 2003). Studies on offspring discrimination have mostly focused on highly 
social vertebrate species with prolonged and complex parental care (Komdeur & Hatchwell, 
1999; Krause & Caspers, 2012), which at the same time are considered to possess high 
cognitive abilities and learning capacities (Byrne & Whiten, 1988; Kummer, Daston, 
Gigerenzer, & Silk, 1997; but see also Holekamp, 2007). Little is known about offspring

 discrimination abilities in less social vertebrates, such as amphibians (but see Poelman & 
Dicke, 2007; Stynoski, 2009). While general kin discrimination and recognition mechanisms 
have been demonstrated for several amphibian species (Blaustein & Waldman, 1992; 
Waldman, 2005), the majority of studies have focused on differential behavioural responses 
towards kin and nonkin among amphibian larvae. In many animals, including amphibians, 
spatial and reproductive behaviours differ considerably between the sexes. In species with 
parental care, differential likelihood and costs of misdirected care might thus drive different 
offspring discrimination strategies in males and females.
We tested this hypothesis in Allobates femoralis, a Neotropical poison frog with sex-specific 
reproductive strategies and spatial behaviour. Males defend territories of about 150 m2 (M. 
Ringler, Ringler, Magaña-Mendoza, & Hödl, 2011) and announce territory ownership by a 
prominent advertisement call (Hödl, Amézquita, & Narins, 2004; M. Ringler et al., 2011; M. 
Ringler, Ursprung, & Hödl, 2009). Females occupy perches which are interspersed between 
male territories (E. Ringler, Ringler, Jehle, & Hödl, 2012). Both sexes are iteroparous and 
highly polygamous throughout the prolonged reproductive season (Ursprung, Ringler, Jehle, 
& Hödl, 2011). Under optimal conditions in captivity females can produce a clutch every 8 
days (Weygoldt, 1980). Courtship and mating occur in male territories where terrestrial 
clutches are laid and fertilized in the leaf litter (Montanarin, Kaefer, & Lima, 2011; E. 
Ringler et al., 2012; M. Ringler et al., 2009; Roithmair, 1992). Females abandon the clutch 
and return to their perches immediately after oviposition; males neither remain close to the 
clutches (i.e. egg guarding) nor provide any further care such as egg moistening or active 
predator defence. After 3 weeks of larval development the tadpoles are generally transported 
by the father to nearby water bodies (E. Ringler, Pašukonis, Hödl, & Ringler, 2013; 
Weygoldt, 1980). However, it has been shown that the mother takes over parental duties 
when the father disappears (E. Ringler, Pašukonis, Fitch, Huber, Hödl, & Ringler, 2015). As 
soon as the parent positions itself on the clutch the larvae wiggle onto the parent's back and 
are subsequently transported to widely dispersed water bodies up to a distance of 200 m (E. 
Ringler et al., 2013).
Considering the differential reproductive strategies and the unequal frequency of parental 
care in male and female A. femoralis, differences in offspring discrimination strategies 
between the sexes can be expected. As clutches are deposited in male territories, males can 
generally assume that all clutches inside their territory are their own offspring, and might 
therefore use a simple discrimination rule such as ‘all clutches inside my territory are mine’. 
In contrast, females have their clutches dispersed across multiple male territories, which, in 
general, will also contain clutches of other females. Thus, if females transfer tadpoles when 
the male disappears, they should be much more selective than males. Tadpole transport is 
likely to be costly for the carrying individual in terms of energy investment, predation risk 
and lost potential mating opportunities. During times of absence other males might also try 
to take over the territory, resulting in serious fights as soon as the former territory owner 
returns (E. Ringler, M. Ringler & A. Pašukonis, personal observation). Transport of 
unrelated offspring would impose these costs on either sex, but without yielding any 
benefits, and thus should be avoided. Specifically, we asked whether males and females 
discriminate between their own offspring and unrelated young and whether they use direct or 
indirect cues when transporting tadpoles. Furthermore, we tested whether parental

 behaviours are only elicited when an individual is predisposed to perform parental care by 
the presence of its own clutch.
Methods
We performed a behavioural experiment under controlled laboratory conditions from August 
2014 to March 2015 in the animal care facilities at the University of Vienna. Both wild-
caught frogs (N = 19) from French Guiana and our own captive-bred individuals (N = 29) 
were used for the experiments (see Table A1). All tested individuals were adult and had 
successfully produced/sired a clutch previously.
Ethical Note and Housing
All frogs used in this study are part of the ex situ laboratory population of the animal care 
facilities at the University of Vienna. Permissions for sampling and export of wild-caught 
frogs were obtained from the responsible French authorities (DIREN: Arrete n° 82 du 
10.08.2012 and Arrete n° du 14.01.2013). All experimental procedures were in strict 
accordance with current Austrian law, approved by the Ethics Committee of the University 
of Vienna, and followed the ASAB/ABS guidelines for the treatment of animals in 
behavioural research and teaching. The experiments were noninvasive as they were based on 
behavioural observations alone and therefore do not fall under the Austrian Animal 
Experiments Act (§ 2, Federal Law Gazette No. 114/2012).
All experiments were performed in standard glass terraria of equal size (60 × 40 cm and 40 
cm high) with identical equipment and furnishing. The floor was covered with pebbles of 
expanded clay, the back and side walls were covered with xaxim (plates made of dried tree 
fern stems) and cork mats, and the front was covered with fabric to prevent visual contact 
between neighbouring terraria and disturbances during maintenance. All terraria contained 
half a coconut shell, a small plant and a branch as suitable shelters and calling positions. We 
provided oak leaves as a substrate for oviposition, and a small glass bowl of 12 cm diameter 
filled with approximately 35 ml of water for tadpole deposition. An automatic raining, 
heating and lighting system ensured standardized climatic conditions with similar 
parameters to the natural conditions in French Guiana in all terraria. Frogs were fed with 
wingless fruit flies every second day. Apart from the transfer of the mating partners to other 
terraria after oviposition in trials 2 and 3, no further disturbance happened during the 
experimental trials.
Experimental Design
Our experiment, with three test conditions, was designed to identify the use of direct and 
indirect cues for offspring discrimination, as well as to determine whether the presence of a 
parent's own clutch is necessary to elicit parental care. In test 1 an unrelated clutch (i.e. a 
clutch from another pair of frogs) was placed inside the terrarium of an individual that had 
no clutch of its own at the time. In test 2 an unrelated clutch was added to the terrarium of an 
individual that already had its own clutch. The unrelated clutch was placed approximately 20 
cm away from the parent's own clutch, and the latter's location was not altered. In test 3 we 
replaced the parent's own clutch with an unrelated clutch and moved the former

 approximately 20 cm from the original location (see Fig. 1). We matched the parent's own 
and unrelated clutches by developmental stage (all between Gosner stages 13 and 17; 
Gosner, 1960) and clutch size. Unrelated clutches did not differ from the parents' own 
clutches in their number of tadpoles (own: mean ± - SD = 14.2 ± 4.3; unrelated: mean ± SD 
= 14.7 ± 5.9; paired t test: N = 30, t29 = −0.44, P = 0.663) in tests 2 and 3.
As it is impossible to manipulate egg clutches directly without substantial destruction, we 
always moved clutches together with the leaves on which they were deposited. In trial 2 the 
leaf with the parent's own clutch was also slightly lifted and then placed back at its exact 
original location, to exclude handling biases. Individuals that participated in test 1 were kept 
isolated by removing the previous partner for at least 3 weeks prior to testing and until they 
had transported any remaining clutches. In tests 2 and 3 we permitted pairs to mate and 
produce one clutch, and a few days after oviposition the respective other partner was 
removed and the unrelated clutch was added. To keep required sample sizes as small as 
possible, we started by conducting tests 1 and 2, while test 3 started only after we identified 
whether males and females discriminate between their own and unrelated clutches. Given 
that most males transported unrelated clutches in trials of both tests 1 and 2, we only used 
females in test 3. All individuals were tested only once (N = 46), or after a break of at least 3 
months before being tested again (N = 2). However, the latter two individuals were not used 
in the same test twice, neither were their data points directly compared in any statistical 
analysis. We checked terraria daily and recorded which clutches were transported to the 
water bodies. In cases where parents' own or unrelated clutches failed to develop, suffered 
from fungus infection or occasional slug predation the trial was stopped and excluded from 
further analyses. If clutches were not transported within 4 weeks after oviposition and dried 
up, this was counted as ‘no transport’. The ratios of successful tadpole transport events 
versus ‘no transport’ were then compared between tests and sexes, respectively, using 
Fisher's exact test, which is particularly robust and conservative if sample sizes are small. 
Alpha for rejection of null hypotheses was set a priori at P < 0.05.
Results
In test 1, 60% of males (6/10) but no female (0/10; Fig. 2a) transported tadpoles of unrelated 
clutches (Fisher's exact test: P = 0.011). In test 2, 90% of males (9/10; Fig. 2b) transported 
both their own and unrelated clutches. Females did not transport unrelated clutches, but 
transported their own clutches in 90% of cases (9/10). Only in a single case (1/10) did a 
female transport both her own clutch and the unrelated one, while another female (1/10) 
refused to carry both clutches (Fig. 2b). Thus, in test 2 tadpole transport of unrelated 
clutches also differed significantly between the sexes (Fisher's exact test: P = 0.001). 
Females in general did not transport tadpoles of unrelated clutches in tests 1 and 2 (no own 
clutch: 0/10; with own clutch: 1/10). By contrast, in test 3 all females (10/10) transported 
unrelated clutches when put in the original location of their own clutch, while they did not 
transport any of their own clutches (0/10) that were moved from their original location (Fig. 
2c).

 Discussion
We found different offspring discrimination strategies in male and female A. femoralis 
during parental care. While males also transported unrelated tadpoles, females discriminated 
between their own offspring and unrelated young according to the exact spatial location of 
the clutch.
Males in general transported all tadpoles that were placed inside their terraria. They even 
transported tadpoles in the absence of their own clutch (i.e. if they had not sired a clutch 
previously), but then they picked up unrelated tadpoles less often than males that had their 
own clutch present. However, the fact that even 60% of those males without their own clutch 
transported unrelated tadpoles suggests a strong motivation in A. femoralis males to 
transport all encountered larvae to water, at least all conspecific ones situated inside a male's 
territory.
In a recent study on tadpole transport behaviour in this species (E. Ringler et al., 2013) 
males were observed to occasionally transport clutches of neighbouring males (four of 119). 
These cases were probably caused by shifts in territory boundaries and show that, although 
rare, transport of unrelated tadpoles also occurs under natural conditions, at least in this 
study population which had a density of about 23 males/ha (M. Ringler, Hödl, & Ringler, 
2015). These field observations are in line with the results of the present study. We suggest 
that strong male territoriality favoured the observed behavioural pattern in males. Males 
actively defend their territories against male intruders (Narins, Grabul, Soma, Gaucher, & 
Hödl, 2005; M. Ringler et al., 2011) and clutches are exclusively laid within territory 
boundaries (Montanarin et al., 2011; Roithmair, 1992). Thus even when clutches might have 
changed their position slightly due to naturally occurring disturbances, such as other animals 
trespassing, males can still generally expect that all clutches inside their territory are their 
own. Consequently, there is no need for males to discriminate between the clutches inside 
their territory. In turn, the costs of accidentally rejecting their own clutch would presumably 
be higher than occasionally transporting unrelated tadpoles (cf. brooding birds that accept 
parasitic eggs, Rothstein, 1975). However, the simple discrimination rule ‘all clutches inside 
my territory are mine’ is only feasible when territories are stable and shifts in boundaries are 
rare. We cannot exclude that males actually recognize their own offspring but still decide to 
transport all tadpoles they encounter. However, given the expected costs associated with 
tadpole transport in terms of energy expenditure, predation risk, potential territory take-overs 
and lost mating opportunities, we consider this scenario unlikely. Follow-up experiments in 
the field are needed to corroborate that males differentiate between clutches that are ‘inside’ 
or ‘outside’ their territory boundaries. Furthermore, future studies should investigate tadpole 
transport behaviour in natural populations with high male densities, where territory shifts are 
probably more common.
Females only transported tadpoles when they had recently produced a clutch and accepted 
clutches based on their exact location. Even their own clutches that were relocated by only 
20 cm were not transported. As tadpoles cannot move between clutches, the exact spatial 
location of the clutch is probably sufficient to allow mothers to approach their own offspring 
(cf. Sherman et al., 1997; Waldman, 1987). The high polygyny and clutch deposition in the

 males' territories can confront females with clutches of several other females in close 
proximity to their own. The likelihood of accidentally picking up the wrong clutch is 
therefore much higher in females than in males. Consequently, establishing rules for 
offspring discrimination is more complex for females. Moreover, misdirected care can be 
expected to have differential costs to the sexes. As males generally transport any clutch 
inside their territory, transporting an unrelated clutch only leads to additional costs for the 
carrying male, but will hardly impact his remaining offspring. In contrast, females only 
transport tadpoles as a specific behavioural response triggered by their partner's 
disappearance. Consequently, the accidental transport of an unrelated clutch would 
automatically result in their own clutch not being transported, as from the female's 
perspective her compensatory duties have already been fulfilled. Thus, the costs of 
misdirected care are much higher for female than male A. femoralis.
Peterson (2000) suggested that if the probability of nest confusion is high, direct egg 
recognition should be favoured. In our study, female A. femoralis did not discriminate 
between clutches based on specific clutch-related cues, but were spatially accurate when 
transporting clutches. We speculate that direct clutch recognition is not feasible in A. 
femoralis because of insufficient phenotypic variation between clutches (cf. Tibbets & Dale, 
2007) and the ontogenetic change from zygotes to the hatched tadpoles. Although scent-
based offspring discrimination mechanisms are known from many vertebrate species 
(Johnston, Muller-Schwarze, & Sorensen, 1999; Yamazaki, Beauchamp, Curran, Bard, & 
Boyse, 2000), apparently odour cues of tadpoles are not used for offspring discrimination in 
A. femoralis (see also Schulte & Veith, 2014). In recent studies, remarkable orientation and 
spatial learning abilities have been demonstrated for two dendrobatid species. In a visual 
discrimination task Dendrobates auratus males used visual cues for spatial orientation and 
were also able to update their visual associations in a reversal learning task (Liu, Day, 
Summers, & Burmeister, 2016). In A. femoralis males, the high accuracy and precision 
during homing behaviour after experimental translocation and the loss of this orientation 
ability in unfamiliar habitat indicate the relevance of spatial learning for flexible navigation 
in their local area (Pašukonis et al., 2013; Pašukonis, Warrington, Ringler, & Hödl, 2014). 
Males repeatedly commute between home territories and tadpole rearing sites and 
presumably possess very detailed knowledge of the surrounding area. Our study suggests 
that females also have very precise spatial knowledge and remember the locations of specific 
clutches over the course of weeks. This is particularly surprising as females will probably 
have produced one or two further clutches with other males during the development of the 
initial clutch (E. Ringler et al., 2012) and as female tadpole transport is rare in the field (7%, 
E. Ringler et al., 2013). In this context, future studies should test whether the simultaneous 
presence of multiple clutches reduces a female's relocation ability. Further studies are also 
needed to identify whether females learn and remember certain features in their complex and 
changing habitat and how they manage to relocate their clutches after several weeks.
Previous studies in other dendrobatid species have shown that Ranitomeya amazonica 
(previously Dendrobates ventrimaculata in this location; Poelman & Dicke, 2007) males do 
not discriminate between offspring and unrelated young, whereas Oophaga pumilio females 
do (Stynoski, 2009). Mothers of O. pumilio provisioned tadpoles regardless of tadpole 
identity, but were highly sensitive to location as they did not provision tadpoles that were

 moved 2 cm to an adjacent cup. Stynoski (2009) hypothesized that the reason why O. 
pumilio, but not R. amazonica, discriminate between offspring and unrelated young, is that 
O. pumilio invest more in their offspring, both transporting and feeding tadpoles, than R. 
amazonica which only transport tadpoles. Our findings do not support the idea that in A. 
femoralis offspring discrimination has evolved in association with high levels of parental 
investment. Offspring discrimination seems to be linked to the risk of choosing the ‘wrong’ 
clutch (e.g. when clutches of different individuals are found in close spatial proximity), 
supporting the hypothesis that offspring discrimination strategies are shaped by the 
likelihood and costs of misdirected care (cf. Beecher, 1991). In fact, this hypothesis is also 
corroborated by the findings of Stynoski (2009) and Poelman and Dicke (2007), as female 
O. pumilio home ranges overlap, whereas male R. amazonica defend well-defined 
reproductive territories.
In some species, offspring recognition is not used until some minimum level of parental 
investment has occurred (Lefevre, Montgomerie, & Gaston, 1998; Mateo, 2006; Müller & 
Eggert, 1990). In the present study males even transported tadpoles when they had no 
clutches of their own, while females did so only when they had recently produced a clutch. 
Parental behaviour is presumably strongly influenced by the hormonal status of an 
individual (Hunt, Hahn, & Wingfield, 1999; Kindler, Bahr, Gross, & Philipp, 1991; 
Neumann, 2008). Our findings suggest that females are predisposed to perform parental care 
only after oviposition and probably also use temporal information for assessing parentage of 
a given clutch. In turn, the continuous calling of A. femoralis males during the rainy season 
might induce and maintain a certain hormonal state in males, where they remain in a 
‘reproductive mode’ which includes mating but also tadpole transport. However, the slightly 
lower tadpole transport rate in males that had not recently sired a clutch indicates hormonal 
and/or motivational changes are also induced by siring a clutch in males. Further studies, 
using larger sample sizes and possibly also hormonal analyses, are needed to more 
accurately investigate motivational changes according to tadpole transport induced by 
courtship and mating in males and females.
Conclusions
We have shown that different offspring discrimination strategies have evolved in male and 
female A. femoralis, probably as a response to different risks of misdirected care between 
the sexes. The high and low selectivity in males and females, respectively, regarding tadpole 
transport reflect differences in the most reliable and efficient solutions for differentiating 
between their own and unrelated tadpoles in the two sexes. Future studies should investigate 
how different uncertainties, such as stability of male territories or higher levels of polygyny, 
influence discrimination strategies in males and females.

Experimental design. (a) Test 1: unrelated clutches were placed inside the terrarium of 
males/females that had no own clutch at the same time; (b) test 2: unrelated clutches were 
added to the terrarium of males/females that already had their own clutches; (c) test 3: 
unrelated clutches were added to the terrarium of females that already had their own 
clutches, at the original location of the parent's own clutch, while the latter was moved 
approximately 20 cm from the original location.
