IMPORTANCE Gamification, the application of game design elements such as points and levels
in nongame contexts, is often used in digital health interventions, but evidence on its
effectiveness is limited.
OBJECTIVE To test the effectiveness of a gamification intervention designed using insights
from behavioral economics to enhance social incentives within families to increase physical
activity.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Behavioral Economics Framingham Incentive Trial
(BE FIT) was a randomized clinical trial with a 12-week intervention period and a 12-week
follow-up period. The investigation was a community-based study between December 7,
2015, and August 14, 2016. Participants in the modified intent-to-treat analysis were adults
enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study, a long-standing cohort of families.
INTERVENTIONS All participants tracked daily step counts using a wearable device or a
smartphone, established a baseline, selected a step goal increase, and received daily
individual feedback on goal performance by text message or email for 24 weeks. Families in
the gamification arm could earn points and progress through levels based on physical activity
goal achievement during the 12-week intervention. The game design was meant to enhance
collaboration, accountability, and peer support.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the proportion of
participant-days that step goals were achieved during the intervention period. Secondary
outcomes included the proportion of participant-days that step goals were achieved during
the follow-up period and the change in the mean daily steps during the intervention and
follow-up periods.
RESULTS Among 200 adults comprising 94 families, the mean age was 55.4 years, and 56.0%
(n = 112) were female. During the intervention period, participants in the gamification arm
achieved step goals on a significantly greater proportion of participant-days (0.53 vs 0.32;
adjusted difference, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.20-0.33; P < .001) and had a significantly greater
increase in the mean daily steps compared with baseline (1661 vs 636; adjusted difference,
953; 95% CI, 505-1401; P < .001) than the control arm. During the follow-up period, physical
activity in the gamification arm declined but remained significantly greater than that in the
control arm for the proportion of participant-days achieving step goals (0.44 vs 0.33;
adjusted difference, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.05-0.19; P < .001) and the mean daily steps compared
with baseline (1385 vs 798; adjusted difference, 494; 95% CI, 170-818; P < .01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Gamification designed to leverage insights from behavioral
economics to enhance social incentives significantly increased physical activity among
families in the community.

ore than half of the adults in the United States do not
obtain enough physical activity and are at higher risk
for cardiovascular disease.1-3 Gamification, the ap-
plication of game design elements such as points and levels

interventions to promote changes in health behaviors, such as
physical activity.4-7 Whereas interest in these approaches is
growing, evidence on their effectiveness is limited, and most
applications have not appropriately leveraged principles from
theories of health behavior.8-10
The rapidly expanding availability of mobile technolo-
giessuchaswearabledevicesandsmartphonesprovidesaplat-
form to monitor daily health behaviors and to deploy inter-
ventions on a broader scale.11 By incorporating insights from
behavioral economics, approaches could be designed to an-
ticipate predictable barriers to behavior change.12-15 Social in-
centives, or the influences that motivate individuals to ad-
just their behaviors based on social ties or connections, are
ubiquitous and could be leveraged within gamification inter-
ventions to provide a scalable, low-cost approach to increase
engagement.16 Evidence indicates that individual health be-
haviors are influenced by social networks,16-19 but more rig-
orous and prospective evaluations in community settings are
lacking.
Our objective was to conduct a randomized clinical trial

insights from behavioral economics to enhance social incen-
tives, such as collaboration, accountability, and peer support,
to increase physical activity. To test this intervention among

Methods
Study Design
The Behavioral Economics Framingham Incentive Trial (BE
FIT) was a randomized clinical trial conducted between
December 7, 2015, and August 14, 2016, consisting of
a 2-week run-in period, a 12-week intervention period, and
a 12-week follow-up period. The investigation was a
community-based study among families in the Framingham
Heart Cohort. The trial protocol is available in Supplement 1
and was approved by the institutional review boards at the
University of Pennsylvania and Boston University Medical
Center.
The study was conducted using Way to Health, a research
platform at the University of Pennsylvania used previously for
physicalactivityinterventions.13-15,20Participantsaccessedthe
study website to create an account, provide online informed
consent,andcompletebaselineeligibilitysurveys.Eligiblepar-
ticipantseitherdownloadedasmartphoneapplication(Moves;
ProtoGeo Oy or Fitbit; Fitbit, Inc) or were mailed a wrist-worn
wearable device (Fitbit Flex; Fitbit, Inc) to track step counts,
and they authorized access for their data to be captured for the
study. Prior work has demonstrated that these devices accu-
rately track step counts.21
Participants
Recruitment occurred from September 23, 2015, to February
26, 2016, using email and telephone calls. Adults already en-
rolled in the Framingham Heart Study were eligible to partici-
pate if they were 18 years or older, had an active email ad-
dress, had access to either a smartphone or computer
compatible with one of the activity tracking devices, and had
at least one other family member enrolled in the Framing-
hamHeartStudywhowasalsoeligibletoparticipatewiththem.
Participants were excluded if they were already participating
in a physical activity study, had been told not to exercise by a
physician,werecurrentlypregnant,orhadatleastonefallwith
significant injury in the past year or if there was any other rea-
son why participation was unsafe or infeasible. Forty-six in-
dividuals who wanted to participate did not have a family
member also interested in participating. We obtained institu-
tional review board approval to allow these individuals to par-
ticipate in a singleton arm that was similar to the control arm.
This was conducted outside of the main trial; therefore, their
outcomes data were not analyzed. Characteristics of these par-
ticipants are listed in eTable 1 in Supplement 2. Participants
who received a wearable device were allowed to keep it; no
other financial compensation was offered.
Baseline Step Count
Before randomization, participants were told to spend a few
weeks getting accustomed to their device. During this run-in
period, we estimated a baseline step count using the second
week of data. The first week of data was ignored to diminish
the potential upward bias of the estimate from higher activ-
ity during initial device use. To prevent potential downward
bias, we ignored any daily values less than 1000 steps be-
cause evidence indicates that these values are unlikely to rep-
resent capture of actual activity.22-24 If less than 4 days of data
were available during the second week (n = 9), the partici-
pant was contacted to inquire about any issues, and the run-in
period was extended until 4 days of data were captured. Nine
participants who began with the Moves smartphone applica-
tion switched to Fitbit (4 to the smartphone application and 5
to the wearable device). These participants had their baseline
step count estimated using only data from the new device.
Key Points
Question Does gamification, the application of game design
elements such as points and levels in nongame contexts, that uses
insights from behavioral economics to enhance social incentives
increase physical activity among families in the community?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 200 adults comprising
94 families, participants in the gamification arm had significantly
greater physical activity during the 12-week intervention than
participants in the control arm, including the proportion of days
that step goals were achieved and the change in the mean daily
steps.
Meaning Gamification designed to leverage insights from
behavioral economics to enhance social incentives could offer
a promising approach to improve daily health behaviors.

 Randomization and Goal Selection
Families composed of 2 or 3 members were randomly
assigned to a study arm. A computerized random number
generator was used with block sizes of 2 families stratified
on family size.
Afterrandomizationbutbeforeparticipantslearnedofstudy
armassignment,eachparticipantwasinformedofhisorherbase-
linestepcountandwasaskedtoselectastepgoalincreaseof33%,
40%, or 50% or any goal at least 1000 steps greater than base-
line. After all family members selected a step goal increase, the
familywasinformedofstudyarminstructions.Allinvestigators,
statisticians,anddataanalystsweremaskedtostudyarmassign-
ments until the study and analysis were completed.
Interventions
All participants selected whether to receive study communi-
cations by text message, email, or both. During the entire 24-
weekstudy,allparticipants(includingthoseinthecontrolarm)
received daily feedback on whether or not they had achieved
their step goal on the prior day. Participants in the control arm
received no other intervention.
Participants in the gamification arm were entered into a
game with their family for 12 weeks that was designed using in-
sights from behavioral economics to address predictable bar-
rierstobehaviorchangeandtoenhancesocialincentives.11First,
participants electronically signed a commitment pledge to try
their best to achieve their step goal. Precommitment has been
demonstrated to motivate behavior change.25,26 Second, ev-
eryMonday,thefamilywasendowedwith70points(10foreach
day of the upcoming week). Each day, the family was informed
of the one member who was selected at random to represent
their team. If that member achieved his or her step goal on the
prior day, the family kept its points; otherwise, 10 points were
lost. This design leveraged the following 3 important psycho-
logical principles: individuals tend to be more motivated by
losses than gains,13 behavior is often better sustained by vari-
able than constant reinforcement,27 and individuals tend to be
moremotivatedforaspirationalbehavioraroundtemporalland-
marks, such as the beginning of the week (the fresh start
effect).28 Third, each individual had 5 lifelines to use on days
when they were sick or activity was infeasible. This element al-
lowedforsomeforgivenessandenabledindividualstoseekhelp
from a family member. Fourth, if the family had 50 points or
more at the end of the week, they advanced up a level (bronze,
silver, gold, and platinum). If not, the family dropped a level.
This design creates achievable goal gradients (the notion that
the next highest level was attainable), a sense of social status,
progression through the game, and longer-term loss aversion
forfamiliesthatreachedhigherlevels.Familiesbeganatbronze
andwereinformedoftheirnewlevelonMonday.Familieswere
not told how other families were doing. Fifth, families were in-
formed that if they finished the intervention period at the gold
orplatinumleveltheyeachwouldreceiveacoffeemugwiththe
study logo as a reward (eFigure in Supplement 2).
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was the proportion of participant-days
that step goals were achieved during the 12-week interven-
tion period. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of
participant-days that step goals were achieved during the
12-week follow-up period and the change in the mean daily
steps from baseline during the intervention and follow-up
periods.
Statistical Analysis
A priori, we estimated that a sample of at least 170 partici-
pants (85 per study arm) would ensure 80% power to detect a
0.15 difference in the proportion of participant-days that step
goalswereachievedbetweenstudyarms,witha2-sidedαlevel
of .05 and accounting for clustering at the level of the family.
This calculation was based on previous studies13-15 and as-
sumed a standard deviation of 0.30, an intracluster correla-
tion coefficient between family members of 0.24, and an 8%
dropout rate.
After randomization, 6 participants were deemed ineli-
gible and were not started in any intervention. One partici-
pant assigned to the control arm lost interest; therefore, the
family member no longer had a group in which to participate.
Two participants assigned to the gamification arm did not se-
lect a goal or receive study arm assignment; thus, their 2 fam-
ily members also no longer had a group with which to partici-
pate. All other randomly assigned participants who received
anintervention(n = 200)wereincludedinthemodifiedintent-
to-treat analysis.
For each participant on each day of the study (participant-
day level), the number of steps achieved was obtained as a con-
tinuous variable, and this number was used to estimate the
mean daily steps. These data were dichotomized at the par-
ticipant-dayleveltocreateabinaryvariableindicatingwhether
or not each participant achieved his or her step goal, and this
variable was used to estimate the proportion of participant-
days that step goals were achieved.
Data could be missing for any day if a participant did not
use the activity tracking device or did not upload data. For the
main analysis, we used multiple imputation (using the mice
package in the R Project for Statistical Computing) for data that
were missing and step values less than 1000. Evidence indi-
cates that step values less than 1000 may not represent accu-
rate data capture,22-25 and our group has accounted for these
values as missing data in prior work.13-15 Five imputations were
conductedusingthefollowingpredictorsofmissingdata:base-
line step count, study arm, calendar month fixed effects, week
in the study, and a binary variable indicating the weekday or
weekend. Results were combined using standard rules by
Rubin.29 Secondary analyses were conducted using collected
data without multiple imputation, both with and without step
values less than 1000.
Unadjusted analyses estimated the proportion of partici-
pant-days that step goals were achieved and the change in the
mean daily steps from baseline by study arm for the interven-
tion and follow-up periods and for each week. In adjusted
analyses, models were fit with generalized estimating equa-
tions (using the geeglm function in the R Project for Statisti-
cal Computing) with an exchangeable correlation structure to
account for the correlation within a family cluster and among
aparticipant’

 resampling participants within each arm 150 times, was used
to estimate 95% CIs and P values.31,32 The prespecified main
model also adjusted for baseline steps and calendar month
fixed effects. As a sensitivity analysis, the main model was es-
timated by also adjusting for the tracking device (wearable de-
vice or smartphone) of participant activity.
Hypothesis tests were 2 sided using a significance level of
.05. Analyses were conducted using R, version 3.2.3; R Proj-
ect for Statistical Computing. A data and safety monitoring
board met before the start of the study and after the interven-
tion and follow-up periods were completed.
Results
Among 1212 adults invited to participate, 307 were assessed
foreligibility.Twohundredadultscomprising94familieswere
randomized and received an intervention (Figure 1). The mean
age of participants was 55.4 years, and 56.0% (n = 112) were
female (Table 1). Other participant characteristics were simi-
lar between study arms. The mean (SD) numbers of partici-
pant baseline daily steps were 7662 (3378) in the control arm
and 7244 (3368) in the gamification arm, which were not sig-
nificantly different (P = .41). The percentage increase in par-
ticipant step goals from baseline was not significantly differ-
ent between study arms (P = .74), with a mean (SD) of 2722
(1740) steps in the control arm and 2340 (1153) steps in the
gamification arm. Almost 40% (79 of 200) of participants se-
lected a custom step goal, and on average these goals were a
49.5% increase from baseline. Family structure and device use
among study participants are available, as well as character-
istics of individuals who did not enroll (eTables 2, 3, and 4 in
Supplement 2).
Ninety-seven percent (194 of 200) of participants com-
pleted the entire 24-week study. During the intervention pe-
riod, step data that were missing or had values less than 1000
steps per day represented 12.7% (1090 of 8568 participant-
days) of observations in the control arm and 10.1% (835 of 8232
participant-days) of observations in the gamification arm. Dur-
ing the follow-up period, these percentages increased to 37.0%
(3166 of 8568) and 42.1% (3462 of 8232), respectively (eTable
5 in Supplement 2).
The mean (SD) unadjusted proportions of participant-
days that step goals were achieved during the intervention pe-
riod were 0.32 (0.24) in the control arm and 0.53 (0.29) in the
gamificationarm(Table2).Theproportionachievingstepgoals
remainedconstantthroughouttheinterventionperiodforboth
study arms but declined for the gamification arm during the
follow-up period (Figure 2). The mean (SD) unadjusted pro-
portions of participant-days that step goals were achieved dur-
ing the follow-up period were 0.33 (0.20) in the control arm
and 0.44 (0.22) in the gamification arm.

 The unadjusted mean (SD) steps per day during the inter-
vention period were 8298 (3836) in the control arm and 8905
(3382) in the gamification arm (Table 2). In the control arm,
the change in daily steps from baseline was near 1000 in week
1, declined to less than 400 by week 5, and then increased to
near 800 by week 12 (Figure 3). In the gamification arm, the
change in daily steps from baseline began near 1550 in week 1
and ranged between 1400 and 1900 during the rest of the in-
terventionperiod.Theunadjustedmean(SD)stepsperdaydur-
ing the follow-up period were 8460 (3186) in the control arm
and 8629 (2783) in the gamification arm.
In the main adjusted model (Table 2), the gamification arm
achievedstepgoalsonasignificantlygreaterproportionofpar-
ticipant-days than the control arm during the intervention pe-
riod (adjusted difference, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.20-0.33; P < .001)
andduringthefollow-upperiod(adjusteddifference,0.12;95%
CI, 0.05-0.19; P < .001). The gamification arm also had a sig-
nificantly greater change in the mean daily steps than the con-
trol arm during the intervention period (adjusted difference,
953; 95% CI, 505-1401; P < .001) and during the follow-up pe-
riod (adjusted difference, 494; 95% CI, 170-818; P = .003). Sen-
sitivity analyses that adjusted for the tracking device of par-
ticipant activity demonstrated similar results (Table 2), as did
secondary analyses using only collected data (eTable 6 and
eTable 7 in Supplement 2).
Oneparticipantinthecontrolarmdiedforreasonsdeemed
by the institutional review boards and data and safety moni-
toring board as unrelated to the study. No other major ad-
verse events were reported (eTable 8 in Supplement 2). Most
participants in both study arms had positive perceptions about
theirexperiencesinthestudy,andmanystatedthattheywould
continue to use their activity tracking devices after the study
concluded (eTable 9 in Supplement 2).
Discussion
In this trial, we found that gamification designed using in-
sights from behavioral economics to enhance social incen-
tives within families significantly increased physical activity
duringthe12-weekintervention.Themeanincreasefrombase-
line among participants in the gamification arm was approxi-
mately 1700 steps, which is almost an additional 1 mile per
day.33 During the 12-week follow-up period, physical activity
levelsamongparticipantsinthegamificationarmdeclinedover
time but overall remained significantly greater than those in
the control arm. These findings demonstrate the potential for
leveraging incentives within social networks to change health
behaviors. The use of wearable devices and smartphones may
offer a scalable approach to deliver these types of interven-
tions on a broader scale. Because this intervention offered only
trivial material reward (a coffee mug), it could be deployed
more widely at low cost.
The results of this trial expand our understanding of using
gamification and social incentives to change health behaviors
and reveal important implications for the design of future in-
terventions. First, an important element of our study was the
use of principles from behavioral economics within the gami-
fication design to address predictable barriers to behavior
change.13-15,25-28 While gamification is used widely across vari-
ousindustries,evidenceonitseffectivenessisinconsistent,8-10,34
and most study designs have not appropriately incorporated
theories from health behavior.8-10 Our findings indicate that
these approaches could be more effective if designed to lever-
age insights from behavioral economics.
Second, although several retrospective studies17-19 have
identified associations between social networks and health be-
haviors, there have been few studies evaluating effects pro-
spectively. Zhang and colleagues35,36 have conducted 2 ran-

reported exercise. However, these studies were conducted
among graduate students, and financial incentives were also
offered, making the effect of social incentives more challeng-
ing to isolate and apply to the general community. In addi-
tion, Zhang and colleagues tested interventions among groups
of anonymous individuals. The use of family networks is a
strength of our study design because these relationships are
widespread and long-standing.
Third, approaches using financial incentives have raised
concern regarding their potential to create effects that do not
persist over time. A study by Finkelstein and colleagues37 ran-
domlyassigned800adultstocontrol,activitymonitoring,cash
incentives, or charity incentives. Over 6 months, the 2 incen-
tivegroupshadgreaterphysicalactivitythanthecontrols.How-
ever, these effects and the use of the activity tracking device
declined during the 6 months after incentives ceased. In our
study using social incentives, 97.0% (194 of 200) of partici-
pants completed the 12-week intervention, and none dropped
out during the 12-week follow-up period. Overall during the
follow-up period, physical activity levels remained signifi-
cantly greater in the gamification arm. However, activity lev-
els in the gamification arm declined in the follow-up period,

to increase longer-term sustainability, such as testing differ-
ent forms of social incentives (eg, competition or support) and

higher than those of previous similar studies,13-15 future in-

population. Third, we evaluated physical activity using step
counts and did not have data on other measures of physical
activity, device wear time, or other health outcomes. Step
counts are most commonly displayed by wearable devices and
have been successfully used in interventions to improve clini-
cal outcomes across different populations.33 However, a sys-
tematic review40 of studies among individuals with type 2 dia-
betes found that improvements in physical activity, including
steps and minutes of activity, did not influence clinical out-
comes. Future studies could evaluate both changes in step
countsandotherclinicaloutcomesoverlongerperiods.Fourth,
while effects were sustained during follow-up overall, activ-
ity in the gamification arm declined after week 20, and fur-
ther evaluations are needed to determine longer-term sus-
tainability. Fifth, we did not test the effect of the intervention
in nonfamily networks.
Conclusions
Compared with a control group of families in the community,
asocialincentive–basedgamificationinterventionamongfami-
lies was effective at increasing physical activity. Our findings
suggest that gamification may offer a promising approach to
change health behaviors if designed using insights from be-
havioral economics to enhance social incentives.

It’s All in the Game—The Uses of Gamification
to Motivate Behavior Change
Ichiro Kawachi, MB, ChB, PhD
Gamification is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as
“Theapplicationoftypicalelementsofgameplaying(e.g.point
scoring, competition with others, rule of play) to other areas
of activity, typically as an on-
line marketing technique to
encourage engagement with
a product or service.”1 In-
creasingly, as highlighted in the new study by Patel and
colleagues,2 it is being used in medicine and public health to
motivate behavior change.
The appeal of gamification is that it “promises to make the
hardstuffinlifefun.

Broadly speaking, games can be single player or involve
multiple players. They can incorporate competition (or not).
This yields a 2 × 2 menu from which to select the design of a
gamified intervention (Table). The simplest game is a solo
player game without competitors (except in the sense of com-
peting against oneself). The format does not require players
to be organized into teams, and it offers maximum flexibility
in terms of scheduling and goal setting. The drawback is in sus-
taining commitment over the long term, which can be sup-
plied by either (1) recruiting peer support and collaboration
(second row of the Table) or (2) introducing competition be-
tween players (right-hand column of the Table).
To return to our example of the virtual zoo, the next step
in gamification would be to introduce a social element, such
