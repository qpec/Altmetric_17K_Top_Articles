 Design, Setting, and Participants—A cluster randomized trial was conducted in 18 centers 
for primary healthcare within a national public system providing free medications and healthcare 
to uninsured patients in Argentina. A total of 1,432 low-income adult patients with uncontrolled 
hypertension were recruited between June 2013 and April 2015 and followed to October 2016.
Intervention—Nine centers (743 patients) were randomized to the multicomponent intervention, 
which included a CHW-led home intervention (health coaching, home BP monitoring, and BP 
audit and feedback), a physician intervention, and a text-messaging intervention over 18 months. 
Nine centers (689 patients) were randomized to usual care without study intervention.
Main Outcomes and Measures—The co-primary outcomes were the differences between the 
intervention and control groups in systolic and diastolic BP changes from baseline to end of 
follow-up in patients with hypertension. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients 
with controlled hypertension (BP<140/90 mmHg). Three BP measurements were obtained at each 
of two baseline and two termination visits using a standard protocol, and the means were used for 
analyses.
Results—Among 1,432 participants (mean age, 55.8 years; 772 [53.0%] women), 1,357 (94.8%) 
completed the trial. Baseline mean BP was 151.7 and 149.8 mmHg for systolic, and 92.2 and 90.1 
mmHg for diastolic in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Systolic BP reduction 
from baseline to month 18 was 19.3 mmHg (95% confidence interval [CI]: 17.9, 20.8) in the 
intervention group and 12.7 mmHg (95% CI: 11.3, 14.2) in the control group; difference in the 
reduction was 6.6 mmHg (95% CI: 4.6, 8.6; p<0.001). Diastolic BP decreased by 12.2 mmHg 
(95% CI: 11.2, 13.2) in the intervention group and 6.9 mmHg (95% CI: 5.9, 7.8) in the control 
group; difference in the reduction was 5.4 mmHg (95% CI: 4.0, 6.8; p<0.001). The proportion of 
controlled hypertension increased from 17.0% at baseline to 72.9% at 18 months in the 
intervention group and from 17.6% to 52.2% in the control group; difference in the increase was 
20.6% (95% CI: 15.4, 25.9%; p<0.001). No adverse events were reported.
Conclusion and Relevance—Among low-income patients with uncontrolled hypertension in 
Argentina, a CHW-led multicomponent intervention compared with usual care resulted in a greater 
decrease in systolic and diastolic BP over 18 months. Further research is needed to assess 
generalizability and cost-effectiveness of this intervention, and to understand which components 
may have contributed most to the outcome.
Trial Registration—clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01834131
Hypertension is a leading global modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and 
premature death.1,2 Despite extensive knowledge of hypertension prevention and treatment, 
the global prevalence of hypertension is high and increasing, while the proportion of 
controlled hypertension is low, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).3 It 
was estimated that 31.1% of the world’s adults had hypertension in 2010, and 75% of those 
with hypertension lived in LMICs. Furthermore, only 7.7% of patients with hypertension 
had their blood pressure (BP) controlled to <140/90 mmHg in LMICs.3 Therefore, 
developing and implementing effective, affordable, and sustainable programs for 
hypertension control is a public health priority in LMICs.

 Barriers at the healthcare system, physician, patient, and community levels hinder BP 
control.4,5 Strategies for overcoming these barriers, including pharmacist-led and nurse-led 
interventions, were shown to improve BP control in patients with hypertension.6,7 For 
example, pharmacist-led interventions were associated with a 7.6 mmHg reduction in 
systolic BP (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.3, 9.0) and nurse-led interventions were 
associated with a 3.5 mmHg reduction in systolic BP (95% CI 1.1, 5.9) in previously 
published meta-analyses.6,7 However, there are limited data on effective intervention 
strategies for hypertension control in LMICs.8,9 Furthermore, the effect of community health 
worker (CHW)-led interventions, a more affordable and sustainable approach for low-
income settings, has not been well tested in randomized trials.
The Hypertension Control Program in Argentina (HCPIA) was a cluster randomized trial 
aiming to test whether implementation of a CHW-led multicomponent intervention over 18 
months lowered systolic and diastolic BP and improved hypertension control among low-
income patients with uncontrolled hypertension in Argentina.
Methods
Study Design and Oversight
The HCPIA trial was a cluster randomized trial conducted among 18 centers for primary 
healthcare within a national public system (Remediar+Redes Program) in Argentina (trial 
protocol in Supplement 1). Details of the trial’s design and analysis plan have been 
published previously.9 The Institutional Review Boards of Tulane University and Hospital 
Italiano de Buenos Aires in Argentina approved the study. Informed consent was signed by 
all participants during screening.
Study Participants
After the 1998–2002 economic depression, a large proportion of the Argentine population 
did not have health insurance, and health care for the uninsured was provided by an 
overloaded national network of public clinics and hospitals.10,11 In response, the Remediar
+Redes Program was funded by the Argentina Ministry of Health to provide free 
medications and healthcare to low-income, uninsured patients.12 Over the past decade, the 
program has evolved to become the main public primary healthcare network in Argentina, 
covering almost all provinces and municipalities with almost 7,000 centers for primary 
healthcare across the country (>90% of all public clinics).
The main eligibility criteria for centers for primary healthcare were an affiliation with the 
Remediar+Redes Program, location in a poor urban area, and employment of CHWs in 
addition to general practitioners and nurses. A total of 204 centers from Buenos Aires, 
Misiones, Tucuman, Corrientes, and Entre Ríos were screened for potential participation. 
Among centers that met the eligibility criteria, 18 were selected based on recommendations 
from the Remediar+Redes Program (Figure 1). Cluster randomization was stratified by 
geographic region and conducted at the data coordinating center at Tulane University. The 
randomization schedules were generated using PROC PLAN in SAS software.

 The main eligibility criteria for index participants were uncontrolled BP (systolic ≥140 
mmHg and/or diastolic ≥90 mmHg on at least 2 separate screening visits), aged ≥21 years, 
uninsured and receiving primary care from the participating centers, and spouses or adult 
hypertensive family members aged ≥21 years living in the same household who were willing 
to participate in the study. The study nurses reviewed the clinic appointment schedules daily 
and identified all patients with hypertension. Two screening visits at least one day apart were 
conducted to assess patients’ eligibility. Eligible index participants, as well as their spouses 
and adult hypertensive family members, were recruited for the study between June 2013 and 
April 2015. To avoid selection bias, participants remained eligible for the study as 
hypertensive participants if they received antihypertensive treatment after the screening 
visits and their BP was <140/90 mmHg at the baseline examination.
Interventions
An 18-month multicomponent intervention program, including a CHW-led home-based 
intervention (health coaching and home BP monitoring and audit), physician education and 
BP feedback, and weekly text-messaging was implemented in the intervention clinics.
CHWs were trained to coach patients and their family members on lifestyle modification, 
home BP-monitoring, and medication adherence during a 2-day interactive training session 
followed by onsite field testing and certification. They were also trained to function as case 
managers for the patients and their families by coordinating intervention activities and 
facilitating patient care. CHWs visited participants’ homes monthly for the first six months 
and every other month thereafter. The family-based intervention started with an initial 90-
minute home visit at a time when all family members in the household were available to 
discuss general knowledge about hypertension prevention and treatment. During subsequent 
60-minute monthly or bimonthly follow-up visits, CHWs provided tailored counseling to 
participants and their families on lifestyle modification, home BP monitoring, and 
medication adherence skills. They reviewed specific strategies for lifestyle modification, 
such as weight loss, dietary sodium reduction, physical activity, alcohol moderation, and the 
DASH (the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, with patients and their families. 
Patients were encouraged to adopt lifestyle modification strategies that were the most 
suitable for their individual needs. All patients with hypertension in the intervention group 
were given an automatic home BP monitor and log and were trained to record their BP 
weekly. Additionally, they were provided 7-day pill organizers and counseled on techniques 
for improving medication adherence. Home visits also focused on goal setting, problem 
solving, social support, and maintaining motivation during challenging situations. CHWs 
helped patients schedule appointments with primary care physicians and delivered 
antihypertensive medications to patients’ homes if they did not have access to transportation.
Primary care physicians took part in an online education course on hypertension 
management followed by an onsite in-person half-day intensive training and certification. 
The physician training program focused on standard treatment algorithms for stepped-care 
BP management based on clinical guidelines.13,14 In addition, annual online hypertension 
management courses were provided for re-certification. Feedback was given to primary care

 physicians, based on home BP monitoring data collected by CHWs, to encourage 
medication adjustment when needed.
Individualized text-messages to promote lifestyle changes and reinforce medication 
adherence were sent out weekly to participants’ mobile phones by an eHealth platform at the 
Institute for Clinical Effectiveness and Health Policy in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Messages 
were based on hypertension status and perceived barriers to behavioral change identified 
during CHW home visits and consisted of motivational statements and behavior-change 
techniques to reinforce in-person education interventions. CHWs also collected information 
on participants’ receipt of text messages.
Usual Care Control
In the centers randomized to the control group, neither physicians nor CHWs were trained to 
conduct study interventions. Additionally, participants did not receive CHW home visits, 
home BP monitors, or text-messages. Participants were encouraged to follow regular the 
clinical visit schedule of the Remediar + Redes Program: monthly among patients after 
pharmacological treatment initiation and every 3–6 months among patients who had 
controlled BP.
Blinding
Study physicians, CHWs, and participants were not blinded to intervention assignment. 
However, study outcomes were collected by nurses who were not involved in the 
intervention.
Outcomes
The co-primary outcomes were the differences between the intervention and control groups 
in mean systolic and diastolic BP changes from baseline to the end of follow-up in patients 
with hypertension. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients with controlled 
hypertension (BP<140/90 mmHg), self-reported antihypertensive medication adherence, 
intensification (titration and/or addition) of antihypertensive medications, cost per additional 
percentage of hypertension controlled, and weight change over the 18-month intervention. In 
addition, difference in the changes of systolic and diastolic BP among normotensive 
participants were secondary outcomes.
Trained and certified research nurses who did not engage in the intervention collected all 
study data at baseline and 6, 12, and 18 months of follow-up in participants’ homes using 
standard questionnaires and measurement methods. Two visits between 1 and 14 days apart 
at baseline and at 18 months were conducted to obtain repeated BP measurements. Three BP 
measurements were obtained at each data collection visit, and the mean of all measurements 
at each time-point was used for analysis. BP was measured according to a standard protocol 
recommended by the American Heart Association.15 BP was measured with participants in a 
seated position after 5 minutes of quiet rest. In addition, participants were required to avoid 
alcohol, cigarettes, coffee/tea, and exercise for at least 30 minutes before their BP 
measurement. An auto-BP cuff (Intellisense Digital BP Monitor; model OMRON HEM-907 
XL) was used, and one of four cuff sizes (pediatric, regular adult, large, or thigh) was chosen

 based on each participant’s arm circumference. Patient adherence to antihypertensive 
medication was quantified using the eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale.16 
Intensification of antihypertensive medications, including titration or addition of a new 
medication, was assessed by questionnaire and medical records. Intensification was used as 
an indicator of primary care physician adherence to the intervention program and related 
clinical guidelines. Adverse events, such as hypotension, syncope, and injurious falls, were 
queried at nurse visits.
Costs related to the intervention (i.e., program coordination, CHW salaries, physician 
training, home visits, BP monitors, and eHealth platform programming) were recorded at 
each clinic or study coordinating center. Costs related to healthcare (i.e., drug expenditures, 
laboratory tests, physician office visits, and hospitalizations) were collected from patients, 
clinics, and hospitals using standard questionnaires.
Statistical Analysis
The trial was designed to provide 80% statistical power to detect a ≥4.0 mmHg reduction in 
systolic BP at a significance level of 0.05 using a 2-tailed test.6,7 Eighteen centers (9 in each 
group) with an average cluster size of 62 patients with hypertension, an 85% follow-up rate, 
an inter-cluster correlation of 0.06, and a standard deviation of 10.0 mmHg were assumed, 
and the cluster design was taken into consideration in the power calculation.17,18
The intention-to-treat principle was used for all analyses. Only patients with hypertension 
were included in the primary analysis, according to the study protocol, because we aimed to 
test the effect of the CHW-led multicomponent intervention on BP control among patients 
with hypertension.9 A mixed-effects regression analysis, in which participants were nested 
in families, which were nested in centers, which were further nested in randomization 
groups, was used to estimate difference in the changes of BP from baseline to 6, 12, and 18 
months, separately. In addition, the mean difference in the changes of BP during the 
intervention period were estimated. In these models, participants, families, and centers were 
assumed to be random effects, and the intervention was assumed to be a fixed effect. An 
autoregressive correlation structure was selected for these repeated measures. In addition, 
generalized estimating equations were used to compare baseline variables and the 
proportions of binary outcomes at 6, 12, and 18 months. Cluster effects were accounted for 
by assuming a compound-symmetry covariance structure, and standard errors were 
estimated using a robust variance estimator. In secondary analyses, important co-variables 
were adjusted, and predefined subgroup analyses were conducted. In these analyses, 
pairwise deletion of missing data was used to preserve all information observed. 
Additionally, multiple imputation for missing data in the multivariable analyses was 
conducted using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. PROC GLIMMIX and PROC 
GENMOD of SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) were used to obtain point 
estimates and standard errors and to test for differences between randomization groups. A 2-
sided p-value <0.01 was considered statistically significant because five main study 
outcomes were compared.
The incremental cost per additional percentage of patients achieving hypertension control at 
18 months was calculated using patient-level data.19 Costs related to intervention and

 healthcare, but not study data collection, were included. Costs were documented in 
Argentine pesos and converted to US dollars as of May 2017 (one dollar =15.8 pesos). The 
95% CI of incremental cost effectiveness ratio was estimated by bootstrapping 1000 
replications of the main analysis.20
Results
From June 2013 to April 2015, a total of 6561 patients with hypertension and their family 
members were screened, and 1,954 who met eligibility criteria were enrolled (Figure 1). Of 
them, 970 participants (743 hypertensive and 227 normotensive participants) were recruited 
from the 9 intervention centers, with a median 107 participants per center (range 104–114), 
and 984 participants (689 hypertensive and 295 normotensive participants) from the 9 
control centers, with a median 117 participants per center (range 48–131). Among 1,432 
participants with hypertension, 1,357 (94.8%) completed the 18-month follow-up.
The mean age of patients with hypertension was 55.8 years and 53.0% were women. In 
general, baseline characteristics of patients with hypertension were balanced between 
intervention and control groups (Table 1). However, the intervention group had a slightly 
higher proportion of individuals with self-reported major cardiovascular disease and 
hypercholesterolemia, as well as higher levels of mean systolic (151.7 vs. 149.8 mmHg) and 
diastolic (92.2 vs. 90.1 mmHg) BP, compared with the control group. Likewise, baseline 
characteristics of normotensive participants were balanced between intervention and control 
groups except for physical activity and diastolic BP, which were slightly lower in the 
intervention compared to control group (eTable 1 in Supplement 2).
Implementation indicators
During the 18-month intervention, CHWs completed 92.8% (8272/8916) of planned home-
based interventions, and patients completed 84.2% (26342/31287) of anticipated home BP 
measurements. In addition, the eHealth platform sent out 91.2% of scheduled text-messages 
and 76.3% of participants reported receiving messages weekly. The proportion of high 
adherence to antihypertensive medication (Morisky score=8) increased from 31.3% at 
baseline to 66.1% at 18 months in the intervention group and from 38.0% to 53.0% in the 
control group (Table 2). The difference in the proportion of high adherence to 
antihypertensive medication was 13.1% (95% CI: 7.0, 19.2%; p<0.001) at 18 months. 
Proportions of medication intensification from baseline to 18 months were 57.6% in the 
intervention group and 42.8% in the control group (p<0.001).
Co-primary outcomes
Systolic BP (95% CI) was significantly reduced from 151.7 (150.5, 152.9) at baseline to 
132.4 (131.2, 133.5) mmHg at 18 months in the intervention group and from 149.8 (148.7, 
151.0) to 137.7 (136.4, 139.0) mmHg in the control group (Figure 2, eTable 2 in Supplement 
2). Diastolic BP was reduced from 92.2 (91.3, 93.0) to 79.5 (78.7, 80.2) mmHg in the 
intervention group and from 90.1 (89.1, 91.1) to 83.7 (82.9, 84.6) mmHg in the control 
group. Difference in the reduction in systolic BP was 6.6 mmHg (95% CI: 4.6 to 8.6; 
p<0.001) and in diastolic BP was 5.4 mmHg (95% CI: 4.0 to 6.8; p<0.001) (Table 2). The

 intra-class correlation coefficients were 0.0768 and 0.0713 for changes in systolic and 
diastolic BP, respectively. Net reductions in systolic and diastolic BP were consistent by age, 
sex, cardiovascular risk (history of major cardiovascular disease, hypercholesterolemia, and 
diabetes), body-mass index, and number of hypertensive family members in predefined 
subgroup analyses (Figure 3).
Secondary outcomes
The proportion of controlled hypertension increased from 17.0% at baseline to 72.9% at 18 
months in the intervention group, and from 17.6% at baseline to 52.2% at 18 months in the 
control group. The difference in the increase in proportion of controlled hypertension was 
20.6% (95% CI: 15.4, 25.9%; p<0.001). The intra-class correlation coefficient was 0.0415 
for hypertension control. There were no significant differences in body weight or waist 
circumference changes between intervention and control groups (eTable 3 in Supplement 2).
There were no significant changes in BP in normotensive participants during the 18-month 
intervention (eTable 4 in Supplement 2). For example, differences in BP changes over 18 
months were 0.6 mmHg (95% CI: −1.6, 2.7; p=0.60) for systolic and 1.8 mmHg (95% CI: 
0.1, 3.5; p=0.04) for diastolic.
No adverse events were reported.
Cost-effectiveness of intervention
Mean intervention cost per patient was $114.6 (95% CI: 113.7, 115.6) or $6.36 per patient 
per month. There were no significant differences in mean healthcare costs per patient 
between the two groups: $62.2 (95% CI: 44.6, 79.7) in intervention and $67.6 (95% CI: 
41.9, 93.3) in control. The total cost per patient over the 18-month follow-up was $178.6 
(95% CI: 161.0, 196.1) in the intervention group and $67.6 (95% CI: 41.9, 93.3) in the 
control group. The mean adjusted total cost difference was $102.7 (95% CI: 61.0, 144.4), 
and the incremental cost effectiveness ratio was $464.7 per additional percentage of patients 
achieving hypertension control at 18 months (95% CI: 335.2, 771.7).
Sensitivity analysis
After multiple imputation for missing data, the difference in the reduction in BP over 18 
months was 6.7 mmHg (95% CI: 4.7, 8.7; p<0.001) for systolic and 5.1 mmHg (95% CI: 
3.8, 6.5, p<0.001) for diastolic (eTable 5 in Supplement 2). The difference in the increase in 
the proportion of controlled hypertension was 19.2% (95% CI: 14.1, 24.3%; p<0.001).
Discussion
This cluster randomized trial indicated that a CHW-led multicomponent intervention was 
effective in reducing systolic and diastolic BP and improving hypertension control among 
low-income, uninsured patients with hypertension in Argentina. The multicomponent 
intervention significantly increased patients’ adherence to antihypertensive medication and 
physicians’ adherence to treatment guidelines.

 These findings may have public health significance. About 80% of all cardiovascular 
mortality occurs in LMICs, where the greatest burden of hypertension is observed.3,21 
Although clinical trials have documented that BP lowering reduces the risk of cardiovascular 
disease and premature death, and affordable antihypertensive medications and lifestyle 
interventions are widely available, hypertension control rates continue to be low in 
LMICs.3,22–24 Lack of effective and sustainable strategies to overcome barriers is a major 
obstacle for hypertension control in under-served populations.25 Therefore, widespread 
scaling-up of this proven effective intervention in LMICs should result in a substantial 
reduction in uncontrolled hypertension and related cardiovascular disease.
Several strategies have been documented to improve BP control in patients with 
hypertension.6,7,26 In addition, multicomponent interventions targeting healthcare systems, 
physicians, and patients have been shown to be more effective.27,28 However, the effects of 
these intervention strategies have not been well studied in low-income settings. In a cluster 
randomized trial, Ogedegbe and colleagues reported that a multicomponent intervention, 
including patient education, home BP monitoring, lifestyle counseling, physician education, 
and BP audit and feedback, did not improve BP control compared to usual care in African-
American hypertensives receiving care in low-resource primary care practices.29 The 
HCPIA trial was also conducted in low-income patients who received healthcare from a 
resource-limited public primary care system in Argentina. The major differences between 
the two trials are that the intervention was led by CHWs and conducted at patients’ homes in 
HCPIA. In another cluster randomized trial, Jafar and colleagues reported that CHW-led 
home health education or general practitioner training alone did not reduce BP.30 However, 
the combination of home health education and practitioner training led to a significant 5.0 
mmHg reduction in systolic BP among patients with hypertension in Pakistan.30 These 
results support CHW-led multicomponent interventions for BP control in low-income 
settings. In many LMICs, CHWs are already employed within the public primary care 
system for infectious disease control and maternal and child healthcare. Training and 
engaging them in hypertension management may provide an effective, affordable, and 
sustainable approach for BP control in LMICs.
This study showed that CHWs can play an important role in hypertension control among 
low-income communities. They provided health coaching to patients and families about 
lifestyle modification and medication adherence; trained and tracked patients’ home BP 
monitoring; served as mediators between patients and the healthcare system and physicians; 
arranged physicians’ appointments and delivered medications when needed; and listened to 
patients and their family members, motivated them, and provided social support.31
A significant BP reduction in patients from control centers was also observed. In the 
Remediar+Redes Program, only 11.6% of patients with hypertension had their BP 
controlled.32 In this study, 52.3% of patients achieved hypertension control at 18 months in 
the usual care group. Patients received repeated BP measurements every six months and 
were interviewed about behaviors related to antihypertensive medication adherence, which 
might have contributed to improvement in medication adherence and treatment 
intensification, and eventually, BP reduction. In addition, intervention contamination could 
have occurred and contributed to the findings observed in the control group. Furthermore,

 BP reduction in patients might be partially due to regression to the mean because 
participants were selected to have elevated BP.
This study has several limitations. It used a cluster randomized trial design because the 
multilevel and multicomponent interventions were implemented at the primary care center 
level. It was not practical to recruit all participants prior to randomization. Therefore, 
selection bias could have occurred. However, patients with hypertension and their family 
members were systematically recruited to avoid selection bias.33 Important co-variables 
were also adjusted to limit potential confounding effects. Another limitation is that 
intervention contamination, if any occurred, might have diluted the observed effect. In 
addition, the incremental cost effectiveness ratio for quality adjusted life years saved was not 
calculated because extensive assumptions were necessary for modeling which was outside 
the scope of this report. Therefore, the cost-effectiveness of this CHW-led multicomponent 
intervention for BP control could not be directly compared with other interventions for 
various conditions.34
Conclusion
Among low-income patients with uncontrolled hypertension in Argentina, a CHW-led 
multicomponent intervention compared with usual care resulted in a greater decrease in 
systolic and diastolic BP over 18 months. Further research is needed to assess 
generalizability and cost-effectiveness of this intervention, and to understand which 
components may have contributed most to the outcome.

 Key Points
Question
Can a community health worker-led multicomponent intervention improve blood pressure 
control among low-income patients with hypertension?
Findings
In this cluster randomized trial among 1,432 low-income, uninsured patients with 
hypertension in Argentina, the community health worker-led multicomponent 
intervention significantly reduced systolic blood pressure by 6.6 mmHg and diastolic 
blood pressure by 5.4 mmHg compared to usual care over 18 months.
Meaning
A community health worker-led multicomponent intervention may improve hypertension 
control in low-income populations.

 Figure 1. Flow diagram of trial participants
Normotensive participants were spouses of hypertensive participants who had systolic blood 
pressure <140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg, and no use of antihypertensive 
medications. The Remediar+Redes Program national coordinating center screened 204 
centers for primary health care from five provinces. Many centers met the eligibility criteria. 
The Remediar+Redes Program recommended 18 centers to the study based on their 
geographic distribution, their willingness to participate, and their previous experience 
collaborating with the coordinating center. The centers were not randomly selected.
