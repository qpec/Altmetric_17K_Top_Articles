IMPORTANCE Bariatric surgery is effective in reducing all-cause and cause-specific long-term
mortality. Whether the long-term mortality benefit of surgery applies to all ages at which
surgery is performed is not known.
OBJECTIVE To examine whether gastric bypass surgery is equally effective in reducing
mortality in groups undergoing surgery at different ages.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS All-cause and cause-specific mortality rates and hazard
ratios (HRs) were estimated from a retrospective cohort within 4 categories defined by age at
surgery: younger than 35 years, 35 through 44 years, 45 through 54 years, and 55 through 74
years. Mean follow-up was 7.2 years. Patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery seen at a
private surgical practice from January 1, 1984, through December 31, 2002, were studied.
Data analysis was performed from June 12, 2013, to September 6, 2015. A cohort of 7925
patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery and 7925 group-matched, severely obese
individuals who did not undergo surgery were identified through driver license records.
Matching criteria included year of surgery to year of driver license application, sex, 5-year age
groups, and 3 body mass index categories.
INTERVENTION Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES All-cause and cause-specific mortality compared between
those undergoing and not undergoing gastric bypass surgery using HRs.
RESULTS Among the 7925 patients who underwent gastric bypass surgery, the mean (SD) age
at surgery was 39.5 (10.5) years, and the mean (SD) presurgical body mass index was
45.3 (7.4). Compared with 7925 matched individuals not undergoing surgery, adjusted
all-cause mortality after gastric bypass surgery was significantly lower for patients 35 through
44 years old (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.38-0.77), 45 through 54 years old (HR, 0.43; 95% CI,
0.30-0.62), and 55 through 74 years old (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.31-0.79; P < .003 for all) but
was not lower for those younger than 35 years (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.82-1.81; P = .34). The lack
of mortality benefit in those undergoing gastric bypass surgery at ages younger than 35 years
primarily derived from a significantly higher number of externally caused deaths (HR, 2.53;
95% CI, 1.27-5.07; P = .009), particularly among women (HR, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.4-6.7; P = .005).
Patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery had a significantly lower age-related increase in
mortality than severely obese individuals not undergoing surgery (P = .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Gastric bypass surgery was associated with improved
long-term survival for all patients undergoing surgery at ages older than 35 years, with
externally caused deaths only elevated in younger women. Gastric bypass surgery is
protective against mortality even for older patients and also reduces the age-related increase
in mortality observed in severely obese individuals not undergoing surgery.

T
he opportunity to explore the equivocal association be-
tween voluntary weight loss and long-term mortality1,2
has been made possible by studying patients who have
undergone bariatric surgery, a treatment that results in sig-
nificant and sustained weight loss.3,4 A number of controlled
retrospective studies5-11 on bariatric surgery mortality, a few
retrospective studies12-14 without control groups, and 1 pro-
spective matched control study15 have been reported. In ad-
dition, 2 bariatric surgery meta-analyses16,17 related to long-
term mortality have been published. From these data, the
general consensus has been that long-term all-cause mortal-
ity and, most often, cardiovascular disease– and cancer-
specific mortality are favorably affected in patients who have
previouslyundergonebariatricsurgery,eveninthosewhohave
already experienced a cardiovascular event18 or were diag-
nosed as having diabetes mellitus before bariatric surgery.19
Furthermore,atleast2retrospectivemortalitystudies6,20have
reported increased rates of externally caused deaths among
patients undergoing bariatric surgery compared with individu-
als not undergoing surgery. External deaths have been de-
fined as unintentional or undetermined injuries or poison-
ingsandintentionalinjuryorpoisonings(eg,suicide,homicide,
assault, or legal intervention).
From these long-term mortality data, an important clini-
cally related question arises. Does the reported mortality ben-
efit of long-term all-cause and cause-specific deaths extend
to all patients undergoing bariatric surgery regardless of the
age at which they underwent surgery? Drawing on a previ-
ously published long-term mortality study6 of Utah-based pa-
tients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, this study
examined whether the overall reduction in mortality after gas-
tric bypass surgery was found for each of 4 different age groups
whenpatientshadtheirsurgery.Onemightexpectthattheear-
lierinlifeaseverelyobesepersonundergoesgastricbypasssur-
gery,thegreaterthereductioninmortality.Thedegreetowhich
gastric bypass surgery is effective in reducing mortality when
performed on older patients (after 55 years of age, for ex-
ample) is unknown. We examined age group–specific com-
parisons of mortality and trends in increasing mortality risk
across age groups between severely obese individuals under-
going or not undergoing gastric bypass surgery. We also ex-
amined whether our prior suggestion of increased mortality
from external causes after gastric bypass surgery differed ac-
cording to age at surgery and sex.
Methods
Study Groups
This investigation was approved by the institutional review
board of the University of Utah with a waiver of consent
granted. The data set was not deidentified primarily because
the record search would not have been possible without the
identifiers. After death status was obtained, however, all sta-
tistical analyses were performed on deidentified data. The
waiver of consent was approved for this approach. Selection
of participants for this age-stratified retrospective study from
January 1, 1984, through December 31, 2002, has been previ-
ously described.6 Data analysis was performed from June 12,
2013, to September 6, 2015. In brief, from a consecutive se-
ries of 9949 patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery and
9628 severely obese (ie, those with a body mass index [BMI]
≥33 [calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by height
in meters squared]) Utah driver license and identification card
applicants, group matching was performed for 7925 patients
undergoing surgery and 7925 individuals not undergoing sur-
gery, after exclusion of patients undergoing gastric bypass sur-
gery who could not be adequately matched to driver license
records. Matching criteria included sex, BMI, age, and year of
surgery matched with year of identification card application.
The presurgical BMI of the patients undergoing surgery was
used to match with the adjusted, self-reported BMI of the in-
dividualsnotundergoingsurgery(sex-specificregressionequa-
tions to adjust driver license–reported BMI to measured BMI
have been previously described6). All data were linked to the
Utah Cancer Registry and to the National Death Index to iden-
tify death status and causes of death as categorized by Inter-
national Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), and
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related
Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), classifications. All
ICD external-caused death codes were combined for analy-
sis. Patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery and individu-
als not undergoing surgery were systematically divided into
4 specific age categories: younger than 35 years, 35 through
44 years, 45 through 54 years, and 55 through 74 years.
Statistical Analysis
With the use of Cox proportional hazards regression analysis,
the risks (hazard ratios [HRs]) of death were estimated by
comparing the patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
surgery and the individuals not undergoing gastric bypass
surgery within each of the 4 age categories. For each age
group, the survival time was computed as the difference
between the date of death for decedents or January 1, 2003,
for survivors and the baseline date, defined as the date of
bariatric surgery for the patient group and the date of driver
license or identification card application for the group not
undergoing surgery.
Baseline age, year of bariatric surgery or the year of driver
license or identification card application, and a cubic polyno-
mial of BMI at baseline were used to adjust the HR in the sta-
tistical models for each age group. Stratification by sex within
theoverallCoxproportionalhazardsregressionmodelwasper-
formed to allow different baseline hazards for each sex to meet
the proportional hazards assumption because mortality dif-
fers by sex. In addition to this sex-stratified model, sex-
specific analyses were performed.
A further model was defined to test for different age-
related increases in mortality risk between the 2 study groups.
Using the individuals younger than 35 years who did not un-
dergo surgery as the reference group, we estimated the mor-
tality risk for each of the remaining 7 age group– and study
group–specific categories. Tests for linear age-related in-
creases in mortality risk for each group and the difference in
the linear trends were performed using appropriate linear con-
trasts of the group-specific β coefficients.

tistical software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Table 1 highlights the descriptive data for all patients under-
going gastric bypass surgery, participants not undergoing sur-
gery, and age-specific categories. The mean (SD) age at sur-
gery was 39.5 (10.5) years, and the mean (SD) presurgical BMI
was 45.3 (7.4). Although no significant differences were found
between the 2 groups for mean follow-up time for all ages com-
bined and for age-specific categories, the mean BMI was con-
sistently 1.2 to 1.5 greater (P < .001) for the group not under-
going surgery compared with the group undergoing surgery.
During the total follow-up period of 18 years (mean, 7.2 years),
there were 213 and 321 total deaths for the groups undergoing
andnotundergoingsurgery,respectively(eTableintheSupple-
ment). Total deaths and death rates per 10 000 person-years
(ie, all-cause mortality) were consistently greater among the
participants not undergoing surgery within the age-specific
groups, with the exception of the subgroup of those younger
than 35 years, in which the group undergoing surgery re-
ported 69 all-cause mortality deaths compared with 50 all-
cause mortality deaths for the participants not undergoing sur-
gery. The increased mortality among the groups undergoing
andnotundergoingsurgeryinthoseyoungerthan35yearswas
primarily owing to externally caused deaths, where the num-
ber of deaths was 35 vs 12 in those undergoing and not under-
going surgery, respectively. Exclusion of externally caused
deaths in this youngest group resulted in a nonsignificant
(P = .37) reduced mortality for nonexternal causes (34 vs 38
deaths among those undergoing and not undergoing surgery,
respectively). The large age-related increases in mortality oc-
curred in those not undergoing surgery, but there was a much
lower rate of increase across age for the patients undergoing
gastric bypass surgery (eTable in the Supplement).
Compared with individuals not undergoing surgery, ad-
justed all-cause mortality after gastric bypass surgery was sig-
nificantly lower for the patients 35 through 44 years old (HR,
0.54; 95% CI, 0.38-0.77), 45 through 54 years old (HR, 0.43;
95%CI,0.30-0.62),and55through74yearsold(HR,0.50;95%
CI, 0.31-0.79; P < .003 for all) but was not lower for the those
younger than 35 years (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.82-1.81; P = .34)
(Table 2). Dividing the participants who were 55 through 74
years old into groups of 55 through 64 years old and 65 through
74 years old (only 78 individuals and 12 deaths) revealed simi-
lar benefits in both subgroups (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.32-0.86,
and HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.07-1.52, respectively). The unad-
justed death rates per 10 000 person-years in those undergo-
ing surgery vs not undergoing surgery were 93 vs 172 in the
group aged 55 through 64 years and 193 vs 447 in the group
aged 65 through 74 years.

those not undergoing surgery (HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.02-2.45). Re-
peating the all-cause mortality analyses after coding the ex-
ternally caused deaths as being censored at their death rather
than as an event, we found that the HR for those younger 35
years was reduced from 1.22 to 0.79 (95% CI, 0.47-1.32)
(Table 2). We also excluded, rather than censored, the partici-
pants who died of external causes from the analysis: the re-
sults were almost identical.
With all ages combined, deaths from cardiovascular dis-
ease (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.36-0.73) and cancer (HR, 0.40; 95%
CI, 0.25-0.64) were significantly lower for those undergoing
gastric bypass surgery compared with those not undergoing
surgery. The HRs for each group of age at surgery for these 2
end points were also universally decreased but were not sig-
nificant for many of the age categories because of the small
numbers of deaths.
The all-cause mortality analyses for the age groups were
repeated separately for men and women. The benefit of sur-
gery was significant or nearly significant for both sexes in each
of the 3 oldest age groups (Table 3). In the youngest age group,
only women had an elevated all-cause mortality risk (HR, 1.42;
95% CI, 0.90-2.26) seen in the sex-adjusted model, although
this finding was not significant (P = .13). The men younger than
35 years had a 21% reduction of risk, but this reduction was not
statistically significant (P = .56). Compared with those younger
than 35 years not undergoing surgery, the mortality rate from
external causes in women who underwent surgery before 35
years of age was 3.08 (95% CI, 1.4-6.7; P = .005), whereas for
men after surgery compared with men not undergoing sur-
gery,themortalityratewasonly0.98(95%CI,0.2-4.8;P = .98).

going gastric bypass surgery with individuals not undergoing

group and compared the mortality of the remaining 7 groups.
These mortality risks were used to estimate age-related trends
in mortality risk for each study group. Figure 1 shows the ex-
pected large significant increases in mortality risk in those not
undergoing surgery the older they are when they enter the
study (HR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.33-2.64, for those aged 35-44 years;

Discussion
This study further investigated the long-term mortality out-
comes of patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery and in-
dividuals not undergoing surgery within 4 groups undergo-
ing surgery at different ages: younger than 35 years, 35 through
44 years, 45 through 54 years, and 55 through 74 years. Pa-
tients who underwent gastric bypass surgery after 35 years of
age had a significant reduction in all-cause mortality com-
pared with those who did not undergo surgery. Before 35 years
of age, mortality was not significantly different, and the HR
suggested an increased all-cause mortality. However, when
deaths from external causes were excluded, the HR sug-
gestedareducedmortalityeveninthoseyoungerthan35years,
although the HR was not significant. Externally caused mor-
tality when gastric bypass surgery occurred before 35 years of
age was 2½ times higher than in severely obese individuals not
undergoing surgery. This significant increase was seen only in
those younger than 35 years and appeared to be confined
mostlytowomen.Furthermore,studyresultssuggestthatgas-
tric bypass surgery may be associated with a lower mortality
risk for cardiovascular disease– and cancer-related deaths ir-
respective of age at surgery, although the youngest and old-
est age groups had comparatively fewer deaths from these
causes and less power to find statistically significant results.
We hypothesized that undergoing gastric bypass surgery
at older ages might reduce the effectiveness of the operation
owing to long-standing disease that would be harder to re-
verse after weight loss. However, it appears that severely obese
persons aged 55 through 74 years who undergo gastric by-
pass surgery are likely to have significantly reduced long-
termmortalitycomparedwithage-matchedindividualsnotun-
dergoing surgery. Although gastric bypass surgery appears to
be effective when performed in individuals at any age, these
results do not imply that a severely obese person should wait
untilanolderagetoundergosurgery.Apriorstudy21foundthat
the risk of complications early after surgery increases with age.
Our results also indicate a significantly slower increase in age-
related mortality risk after gastric bypass surgery than in se-
verely obese individuals.
Longer-term mortality studies6-13,15,19,22,23 of patients un-
dergoing bariatric surgery have generally reported a reduc-
tion in all-cause mortality and reduced death rates from cer-
tain diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. An
exception is an initial study10 of predominantly male veter-
ans who, after bariatric surgery, did not have a mortality ben-
efit after 6.7 years of follow-up compared with individuals not
undergoing surgery. A subsequent analysis11 of an expanded
sample of 2500 veterans undergoing bariatric surgery, how-
ever,foundasignificant5-and10-yearmortalitybenefitinmen
after analyzing the first surgical year separately (despite no sig-
nificant mortality difference at 1 year). From this study and the
results of another study,24 it would appear that the survival
advantage of bariatric surgery might not be manifest until af-
ter the first postsurgical year. The significant long-term mor-
tality benefits for men in the study10 of veterans, along with
the results of major long-term observational studies6,7,15,19 in
bariatric surgery cohorts predominantly composed of women,
are confirmed by this Utah-based age- and sex-stratified re-
portrevealingsignificantlonger-termmortalitybenefitformen
and women. This benefit was independent of the year of sur-
gery, which was a nonsignificant predictor of mortality in all
models.Inaddition,oursex-specificanalysesrevealedahighly
significant total mortality reduction of 77% in men who had
surgery at 55 through 74 years of age, a greater reduction than
in any other age group of men or women.
An important finding of this study is that patients who un-
dergo gastric bypass surgery at a younger age (ie, <35 years)
are at greater risk of death from external causes. The sex-
specific analyses suggested that this increased mortality risk

from external causes was confined to women who under-
went surgery before 35 years of age, although men accounted
for only 24% of this age group. Even though none of the other
age groups had significant increases (or decreases) in mortal-
ity owing to deaths from external causes, the number of deaths
remains small. The nonsignificant but elevated HR of 1.3 for
externally caused deaths for the 2 oldest groups suggests that
greater statistical power is required to evaluate the impor-
tance of these estimates. There were too few deaths to subdi-
vide by the various causes of death within the external cause
definition,suchaspoisoningorsuicide.Therefore,atthistime,
counseling each patient on expectations about and risks of
these external causes of death should probably be given with-
out regard to age at surgery. Finally, with reference to pa-
tients who underwent surgery at younger than 35 years, al-
though the HR of 0.79 for patients undergoing surgery
compared with those not undergoing surgery was not signifi-
cant (95% CI, 0.47-1.32; P = .37) for nonexternally caused
deaths, there was a favorable trend for reduced mortality. The
lack of significance may have been the result of too few deaths
relatedtochronicillnesses(ie,cardiovasculardisease–andcan-
cer-related deaths) in this younger-age group. Longer fol-
low-up of these individuals is required for a more definitive
assessment of mortality risks in those younger than 35 years.
Althoughlimited,observationalstudies20,25-29suggestthat
some procedures, such as gastric bypass surgery, may increase
thelong-termriskofsubstanceusedisordersandsuicide.How-
ever, several studies30-33 report that individuals presenting for
surgeryarealreadyathigherriskofpsychiatricdiseaseandsub-
stance abuse, indicating that deaths after surgery from these
causes may not be directly associated with the surgery. At the
6-yearfollow-upofourprospectiveUtahstudy,theMedicalOut-
comes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey assessment of
physical health–related quality of life was improved among the
surgical group, but the mental health status was not.4,34 As
Livingston35 has pointed out, there is a great deal of overlap be-
tweenmentalhealthdisordersandobesity.Inadditiontothepo-
tentialincreasedriskofsubstanceusedisorders,postsurgicaldis-
satisfactionrelatedtopresurgicalexpectationsmayexist.Clearly,
additional research related to the behavioral and psychological
aspects before and after bariatric surgery, perhaps especially in
the younger population, is warranted.
Limitations related to this study included the lack of clini-
cal information before or after surgery or driver license appli-
cation,withtheexceptionofpresurgicalBMIorBMIatthetime
ofdriverlicenseoridentificationcardapplication,age,andsex.
Asaresult,whetherthepatientsundergoinggastricbypasssur-
gery had presurgical health statuses similar to those of the in-
dividuals not undergoing surgery or whether greater medical
attention was provided for patients undergoing surgery as a
result of their entry into the surgical medical system was not
known. There were too few cardiovascular disease–or cancer-
related deaths to find statistically significant results in 3 of the
4agegroupswhenthediseaseswereanalyzedseparately.How-
ever, the protective HRs suggest a likelihood that they would
becomestatisticallysignificantiflongerfollow-upcouldbeper-
formed. Potential bias related to self-reported height and
weight among driver license and identification card appli-
cants may have been present, despite the sex-specific regres-
sion correction. Inadequate statistical adjustment for this self-
reporting of BMI may be an explanation of the significantly
different mean BMIs of 1.2 to 1.5 reported in Table 1 between
the 2 study groups. Other potential biases related to the Na-
tional Death Index matching have been previously described.6
Strengths of this study included the large number of patients
undergoing gastric bypass surgery retrospectively followed up
for up to 18 years and the opportunity to divide mortality re-
sults into separate age categories and by sex.
Conclusions
This study found that the increased mortality from external
causes in patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery was lim-
ited to the subgroup of women who underwent surgery before
35 years of age. Importantly, this study implies that gastric by-
passsurgeryisprotectiveagainstmortalityevenforpatientswho
undergo surgery at an older age. Gastric bypass surgery also re-
duces the age-related increase in mortality risk compared with
severely obese individuals who do not undergo surgery.
