Abstract
MicroRNA-based therapies that target cardiomyocyte proliferation have great potential for the 
treatment of myocardial infarction (MI). In previous work, we showed that the miR-302/367 
cluster regulates cardiomyocyte proliferation in the prenatal and postnatal heart. Here, we describe 
the development and application of an injectable hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel for the local and 
sustained delivery of miR-302 mimics to the heart. We show that the miR-302 mimics released in 
vitro promoted cardiomyocyte proliferation over one week, and that a single injection of the 
hydrogel in the mouse heart led to local and sustained cardiomyocyte proliferation for two weeks. 
After MI, gel/miR-302 injection caused local clonal proliferation and increased cardiomyocyte 
numbers in the border zone of a Confetti mouse model. Gel/miR-302 further decreased cardiac 
end-diastolic (39%) and end-systolic (50%) volumes, and improved ejection fraction (32%) and 
fractional shortening (64%) four weeks after MI and injection, compared to controls. Our findings 
suggest that biomaterial-based miRNA delivery systems can lead to improved outcomes in cardiac 
regeneration.

 Heart disease is the leading cause of mortality across the world - in the United States and 
Europe, heart disease contributes to 600,000 and 4,000,000 deaths each year, respectively.1,2 
Myocardial infarctions (MI), or heart attacks, are individually linked to at least 50% of 
deaths.2 During MI, blood supply to cardiac tissue is compromised, initiating a tissue 
remodeling response. Central to this process is the permanent loss of contractile 
cardiomyocytes, the native muscle cell in the heart, and the replacement of healthy tissue 
with non-contractile, fibrotic tissue. Improved management of acute MI through medical and 
surgical intervention has allowed up to 95% of patients to survive hospitalization2; however, 
many of these patients will develop chronic heart failure, resulting in a 50% mortality rate at 
five years post-MI.2
Since a hallmark of MI is cardiomyocyte cell death, increasing the number of 
cardiomyocytes within the damaged myocardium may improve cardiac function. The major 
challenge to this approach is the limited capacity for renewal of cardiomyocytes in the adult 
heart.3,4 Cardiomyocytes are often thought of as being terminally differentiated, exiting the 
cell cycle within the first week postnatally with low to non-existent levels of proliferation 
after injury.5,6 This limited renewal capacity exacerbates the damage from ischemic injury 
during MI, as damaged cells are replaced with fibrotic scar tissue rather than contractile 
cardiomyocytes.7
Cellular therapy for cardiac regeneration remains an unmet challenge in the treatment of MI. 
Many cell types have been used in attempts to replace lost cardiomyocytes, including 
mesenchymal stem cells,8,9 skeletal myoblasts,10 and embryonic11 or induced pluripotent 
stem cell derived cardiomyocytes.12 However, only cardiomyocytes derived from pluripotent 
stem cells have been shown to engraft and produce functional myocardium. An alternative to 
cell delivery is to promote endogenous cardiomyocyte proliferation using growth factors, 
small molecules, and gene transfer.13–15 Among these strategies, certain microRNAs 
(miRNAs) induce cardiomyocyte proliferation, sometimes leading to improved cardiac 
function.16,17
miRNAs are 18–22 nucleotide long double-stranded RNAs that regulate gene expression 
post-transcriptionally by base-paring with the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) of target 
messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and inhibiting their expression. In our previous work, we 
identified a cluster of miRNAs (miR-302/367) that induced proliferation in cardiomyocytes 
through a direct binding site on the 3’ UTR of Mst1, Lats2, and Mob1, leading to inhibition 
of Hippo signaling. Consequently, Yap, the transcriptional effector of the Hippo pathway, 
translocated to the nucleus to interact with the TEAD transcription factor family to activate 
gene expression pathways that promote cellular proliferation.18 In mice, constitutive 
expression of the miR-302–367 cluster led to cardiomyopathy after MI due to persistent de-
differentiation in cardiomyocytes. However, systemic daily administration of miR-302 
mimics for one week after MI promoted cardiac regeneration by transiently reactivating the 
cardiomyocyte cell cycle to increase cell number, leading to proliferation and improved 
function. This work served as a proof of concept for miR-302 in regeneration; yet, systemic 
delivery had significant limitations including potential off-target organ accumulation and the 
need for serial daily administrations.

 Here, we demonstrate the use of local intramyocardial delivery of miR-302 mimics to 
infarcted myocardium via an injectable hydrogel, in an attempt to achieve miR-302 
translation and overcome the limitations of systemic delivery. Hydrogels are water-swollen, 
cross-linked polymers capable of encapsulating and releasing therapeutics after injection 
into tissues.19,20 Hydrogels have been explored widely for injection into cardiac tissue21–26 
and several formulations are currently in clinical trials and have demonstrated safety in 
humans.27 Hydrogels can be designed to undergo shear-thinning, in which physical 
crosslinks are reversible under shear stress, which allows them to be injected through a 
syringe or catheter.28 We previously developed shear-thinning, injectable hydrogels based on 
the guest-host interaction of modified hyaluronic acid (HA), a naturally occurring 
glycosaminoglycan.23–25 HA was modified with β-cyclodextrin (CD, host) or adamantane 
(AD, guest), where CD and AD form complexes in a defined structural arrangement with 
high affinity (Ka ~ 1 × 105 M−1). Thus, when CD-modified HA is mixed with AD-modified 
HA, they form a hydrogel that exhibits shear-thinning behavior during injection and rapid re-
healing after removal of shear, permitting injection into cardiac tissue.22,23,25,29
In this work, we utilize this guest-host HA hydrogel system to form injectable gel/miR-302 
complexes that release miR-302 to promote cardiomyocyte proliferation and regeneration 
after MI. Moreover, the gel/miR-302 induced cardiomyocyte proliferation leads to recovery 
of cardiac function. Thus, a combined gel/miRNA approach can be effectively used to 
promote mammalian cardiac regeneration through temporal specific activation of 
cardiomyocyte proliferation.
Cholesterol-modified mimics and CD–HA interaction
We previously identified miR-302b and miR-302c as active miRNAs in the miR-302–367 
cluster that modulates Hippo signaling, leading to cardiomyocyte proliferation.18 To 
improve cellular uptake, miR-302b and miR-302c were modified with cholesterol on the 5’ 
end of the passenger strand. As previously reported, cholesterol-modified double-stranded 
RNAs are passively internalized by cells in vitro and in vivo while unmodified RNAs are 
naturally repelled by cells due to electrostatics.30–33 To ensure that cholesterol modifications 
improved miR-302 mimic uptake, miR-302b and miR-302c with and without cholesterol 
modifications were added to mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes in culture and cells were 
stained with antibodies against Ki67, a marker for proliferation. Cardiomyocytes treated 
with cholesterol-modified miR-302b and miR-302c mimics (miR-302-chol) were 
significantly more proliferative (Ki67+) than those treated with unmodified mimics 
(Supplementary Figure 1a,b). Moreover, treatment of cardiomyocytes with cholesterol-
modified mimics also led to intracellular expression of miR-302 and knockdown of its 
Hippo signaling targets Lats2, Mob1, and Mst1 (Supplementary Figure 1c,d).18 Future 
studies were performed with equimolar amounts of miR-302b and miR-302c, hereafter 
simply termed miR-302.
Cholesterol is hydrophobic and has been well-described as a guest for interaction with CD 
as a host, suggesting that cholesterol-modified mimics may have improved affinity for CD-
HA (Figure 1a).34,35 To examine this interaction, we developed a fluorometric binding assay 
adapted from other similar assays.36,37 Rhodamine B (Rho) fluorescence was quenched by

 CD-HA due to guest-host interactions between CD and Rho; however, cholesterol has a 
higher affinity for CD and should displace Rho and recover fluorescence. We observed that 
adding cholesterol-modified miR-302 increased the fluorescence of the solution suggesting 
that cholesterol-modified miR-302 bound to CD–HA in a dose-dependent fashion (Figure 
1b, Supplementary Figure 2a,b). In contrast, un-modified miR-302 did not change the 
solution fluorescence, suggesting minimal interaction (Supplementary Figure 2c). Assuming 
negligible Rho binding, a binding constant for miR-302-chol/CD–HA complex formation 
was approximated as Ka = 2.0 × 103 M−1 by fitting to the Benesi-Hildebrand equation, in 
agreement previous reports (Supplementary Figure 2d,e).38 Cholesterol-modified miR-302 
mimics were then assembled into gels with CD-HA and AD-HA (~20% modification of HA 
with either CD or AD, Supplementary Figure 3). Release of cholesterol-modified miR-302 
was sustained from gels over three weeks (Figure 1c), which was slower than the release of 
mimics without cholesterol, confirming the cholesterol/CD interaction (Supplementary 
Figure 4).
To confirm that cholesterol-modified miR-302 did not affect mechanical and erosion 
behavior of gels, we performed oscillatory rheology and gel erosions assays with and 
without encapsulated miR-302. Storage (G’) and loss (G’’) moduli were equivalent for gels 
with and without encapsulated cholesterol-modified miR-302 (Supplementary Figure 5a). 
Shear-yielding and recovery were also observed in response to alternating high and low 
strain, demonstrating the ability of these gels to thin under shear strain and rapidly 
reassemble upon cessation of strain, permitting injection and rapid recovery of the gel/
miR-302 system (Supplementary Figure 5b). Gel erosion was not affected by inclusion of 
cholesterol-modified miR-302 in the system (Supplementary Figure 6). Taken together, 
cholesterol-modification of miR-302 mimics serves to both enhance cellular uptake and 
improve affinity for the gel without compromising gel mechanics, shear-thinning, or erosion.
In vitro bioactivity of gel/miR-302 assemblies
To assess the effect of gel/miR-302 assemblies on cardiomyocyte proliferation in vitro, 
supernatants from gel assemblies with miR-302 were collected and replaced serially over 
two weeks (Figure 2a). Neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes were treated with supernatants from 
gel/miR-302 or controls and stained with DAPI and antibodies to detect Ki67 and cardiac 
Troponin T (cTnT). Gel/miR-302 assemblies significantly enhanced proliferation (~20–25% 
positive for Ki67+cTnT+) from D0-D1, D1-D4 and D4-D7 compared to gels with a non-
specific sequence (gel/miR-NC) or gels alone (~10% positive for Ki67+cTnT+) (Figure 
2b,c). At early time intervals (D0-D1, D1-D4, and D4-D7), between ~0.15–0.3 µg/µL (5–10 
µM) of miR-302 was released (Supplementary Figure 7), which we showed is biologically 
active (Supplementary Figure 1) and induced neonatal cardiomyocyte proliferation. At later 
time intervals (D7-D10, D10-D14, D14-D21), ~0.1 µg/µL miR-302 was released, leading to 
no proliferation compared to controls. Since our previous study showed that transient 
delivery of miR-302 for one week could enhance cardiac function in vivo, the gel release 
profile in vitro suggests that gel/miR-302 may replicate serial dosing for one week from a 
single gel injection.

 In vivo bioactivity of gel/miR-302 after cardiac injection
Neonatal cardiomyocytes retain some proliferative capacity and therefore may be more 
responsive to miR-302 stimulation; thus, we sought to test the bioactivity of gel/miR-302 
assemblies in adult cardiomyocytes, which have extremely limited capacity to proliferate 
both in vitro and in vivo. Gels were ejected from 27G × 1/2” tuberculin syringes into water 
to demonstrate their capacity for injection with rapid reassembly and minimal cargo loss 
(Figure 3a). Gels were then injected in two regions (2 × 5 µL) inferior and lateral to the 
proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) in non-infarcted hearts of adult male mice, 
corresponding to the border zone of the infarct (Figure 3b). At 5, 14, or 28 days, hearts were 
stained for markers of cardiac proliferation, Ki67 and phosphorylated histone H3 (pH3), and 
a marker of cytokinesis, Aurora B kinase (Aurora B). Sites of injection were identified from 
Troponin T negative areas and proliferation in cardiomyocytes (Troponin T positive) was 
quantified around these sites of injection for all three markers.
Gel/miR-302 injections significantly increased the proportion of Ki67+ cardiomyocytes 
(Figure 3c). Cardiomyocyte proliferation was sustained at D5 and D14 in gel/miR-302 
compared to gel/miR-NC, but was no longer present by D28 (Figure 3e). Gel/miR-302 also 
induced non-myocyte proliferation at D14 and D28, although at lower levels than both 
groups at D5 (Supplementary Figure 8a). pH3+, and Aurora B+ cardiomyocytes around the 
site of gel/miR-302 injection were also elevated compared to controls at five days (Figure 
3d), demonstrating up to ~3% and ~2% of cardiomyocytes staining positive for these 
proliferation markers (Figure 3f,g).
Of note, gel/miR-302 led to significantly more cardiomyocyte proliferation than PBS/
miR-302 (Supplementary Figure 8b), suggesting sustained release and improved retention of 
miR-302 by the gel in vivo. Injections with gel/miR-NC also led to very low levels (<1%) of 
cardiomyocytes staining for of Ki67, pH3 and Aurora B, corroborating the very rare and 
limited capacity for adult cardiomyocyte self-renewal.39,40 Proliferating cardiomyocytes and 
non-myocytes were found within <200 µm of injection (Supplementary Figure 8c). To 
confirm that cardiomyocytes were proliferating through inhibition of Hippo signaling, 
sections were stained for Yap. In gel/miR-302 sections, there was increased total Yap in the 
nucleus in support of our established mechanism by which Yap dephosphorylated and 
localizes to the nucleus secondary to miR-302 (Supplementary Figure 9).18 No differences 
in cardiomyocyte maturity were observed following stimulation (Supplementary Figure 10),
Clonal proliferation in MHC-Confetti mouse model
To verify that the proliferation observed after gel/miR-302 treatment could generate new 
cardiomyocytes after MI, lineage tracing analysis was performed using a multicolor R26R-
Confetti Cre-reporter system with loxP-flanked nuclear green fluorescent protein (nGFP), 
red fluorescent protein (RFP), yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), and monomeric cyan 
fluorescent protein (mCFP) (Figure 4a).41 The construct was designed such that random 
recombination activates only one of the four fluorescent protein genes, allowing stochastic 
labeling of target cells and their descendants with a single color. This reporter system also 
allows cell fate analysis using any inducible Cre activation mouse line (Figure 4b).41–43

 Confetti mice were bred with the Cre transgene expressed under the myosin heavy chain 6 
(Myh6) promoter (Myh6-MerCreMer, also abbreviated MHC-MCM) to express Cre 
specifically in cardiomyocytes in response to tamoxifen.44 In this system, Myh6-
MerCreMer:R26R-Confetti labeled cells and their daughter cells could express one of four 
different fluorescent reporters: nGFP, YFP, RFP, or mCFP.
Tamoxifen doses were titrated to ensure low levels of Myh6+ cardiomyocyte labeling so that 
individual clones could be identified (Supplementary Figure 11a). After tamoxifen, MI was 
induced by ligation of the LAD. Gel/miR-302 or gel/miR-NC (2 × 5 µL) was then injected 
adjacent to the infarct in the border zone. At 4 weeks, gel/miR-302 injected hearts were 
strongly labeled in the infarct border zones (Figure 4c), suggesting increased lineage labeled 
cardiomyocytes due to clonal expansion. In contrast, gel/miR-NC injected hearts exhibited 
sparse labeling that mimicked hearts prior to injection (Supplementary Figure 11b). 
Confocal imaging revealed expression of nGFP, RFP, and YFP in adult hearts injected with 
both gel/miR-NC and gel/miR-302 (Supplementary Figure 12a). In our hands, the 
expression of mCFP was too weak to reliably detect, as previously reported.41,42
Clonal cardiomyocytes expressing nGFP, RFP, and YFP were clearly identified in gel/
miR-302-injected hearts while few clones were observed from gel/miR-NC injection 
(Supplementary Figure 12a,b). Among labeled cardiomyocytes, multiple clusters expressing 
nGFP were detected in gel/miR-302 injected hearts and localized to the border zone of the 
infarction (Supplementary Figure 12a). The average distance between nGFP+ cells was 
significantly lower in gel/miR-302 treated groups, suggesting that these cells were derived 
from a common single cell (Supplementary Figure 12c,d). Further analysis with Wheat 
Germ Agglutinin (WGA) staining to identify cell membranes showed fluorescent cells 
within 50 µm were mostly contiguous in gel/miR-302 treated groups but not in gel/miR-NC 
groups (Figure 5a). No differences in cardiomyocyte size were observed in the three 
fluorescent channels using WGA to distinguish between cardiomyocytes (Supplementary 
Figure 12e). In gel/miR-NC groups, distant cells (>50 µm) were often interspersed by 
unlabeled cardiomyocytes. Using 50 µm as a standard, we quantified the number of cells to a 
single clone for nGFP, RFP, and YFP across all sections of the heart in the border zone of 
infarcts. Gel/miR-302-injected hearts had a significant increase in the number of cells per 
clone (as many as 8), suggesting that these cells were derived from a common parent cell 
that had divided (Figure 5b). Our results demonstrating expansion of clones parallel those of 
other reports that have used this system.45–47
Gel/miR-302 complex pharmacokinetics
To demonstrate that miR-302 mimics were localized and sustained in the heart after MI, the 
gel was labeled with a near-infrared fluorescent molecule through a Michael addition 
between a thiolated Cy7.5 dye and methacrylated CD-HA (CD-Me-HA) (Supplementary 
Figure 13).23 Cy7.5-labeled CD-HA was then assembled into gels with miR-302 and 
injected into the heart following MI for ex vivo tracking at various times.
Immediately following injection, gels exhibited intense signal surrounding the infarct site at 
the two injection sites (Figure 6a). This signal declined over the first week and distributed

 over the heart, where it dissipated by 28 days. Quantification demonstrated a reduction in 
radiant efficiency by ~90% over the first week, suggesting highest rates of clearance during 
this period (Figure 6b). From qPCR, miR-302 expression in the heart was highest at D1, 
decreased over the first two weeks, and was similar to controls by D28 (Figure 6c). The 
targets of miR-302, Lats2, Mob1, and Mst1, also decreased in the heart by D7, suggesting 
bioactivity of the gel/miR-302 complex in modulating these components of Hippo signaling 
(Figure 6d). Low miR-302 expression was observed in the lungs at D7 (Supplementary 
Figure 14), suggesting vascular drainage of miR-302 through the coronary sinus.
Cardiac function after MI and gel/miR-302 injection
Recognizing the ability of gel/miR-302 to induce both cardiomyocyte proliferation and 
clonal, we examined the ability for of gel/miR-302 injections to improve physiological 
outcomes after MI by echocardiography. Adult mice were selected to receive gel/miR-302, 
gel/miR-NC, or PBS injection after MI. After four weeks, cardiac function was analyzed 
through echocardiography and measurements of left ventricular end diastolic volume 
(LVEDV), left ventricular end systolic volume (LVESV), ejection fraction (EF), and 
fractional shortening (FS) were made. Gel/miR-302 treated mice had reduced cardiac 
remodeling, demonstrated by reductions in LVEDV and LVESV, measures of cardiac 
volumes at the beginning and end of a single contraction, respectively, compared to PBS or 
gel/miR-NC controls (Figure 7a,b). LVEDV and LVESV of gel/miR-302 treated animals 
were not significantly different from non-infarcted mice. Whereas PBS and gel/miR-NC 
treated animals had significantly reduced EF and FS, EF and FS of gel/miR-302 treated 
animals were not significantly different from non-infarcted mice (Figure 7c,d). Masson’s 
trichrome staining at four weeks shows that the smallest ventricular areas from axial sections 
were with gel/miR-302 treatment, while gross tissue specimens also demonstrated decreased 
infarct size (Figure 7e). When quantified, gel/miR-302 appeared to decrease infarct size 
compared to gel/miR-NC from Masson’s trichrome sections, although this effect was not 
statistically significant (Figure 7f, Supplementary Figure 15). Representative 1-D 
echocardiographic M-mode measurements of wall movement are shown (Figure 7g), which 
illustrate improved anterior wall movement and decreased systolic and diastolic inner left 
ventricular diameters in gel/miR-302 treated mice. No changes in apoptosis or vascular 
density were observed at D28 between gel/miR-NC and gel/miR-302 treatments to suggest 
improvements were related to the cardiomyocyte response (Supplementary Figure 16, 
Supplementary Figure 17).
Discussion
The present study demonstrates that an engineered hydrogel, designed for injection and 
sustained delivery of miR-302, promotes both cardiomyocyte proliferation and functional 
regeneration. Our hydrogel system was developed to overcome the limitations of systemic 
delivery and to replace the requirement for 7 days of serial injections with sustained release 
from a single gel injection into the myocardium. The guest-host assembly mechanism was 
particularly attractive for this application as it permitted injection and self-healing to 
improve retention, and could potentially be adapted to minimally invasive delivery methods

 (e.g., catheter). Lastly, the hydrogel was designed from HA, a component used in numerous 
clinical applications.48
To further control release, the guest-host assembly mechanism also presented cyclodextrin 
that can be used to sequester cholesterol-modified miRNA in the hydrogel. Interestingly, 
binding of cholesterol to the cyclodextrin had minimal effects on gel erosion and mechanics 
while sustaining the release of the miRNA mimics over three weeks in vitro, slower than 
when these interactions are not included. Because mimics released faster than the gel 
eroded, we believe diffusion played a major role in release, likely due to the dynamic 
interactions within the gel and anionic repulsion between negatively charged HA and RNA. 
Mimic release may also be sustained due to increase in size by cholesterol modification and 
the ability for cholesterol to aggregate with itself due to hydrophobicity, causing entrapment 
within the network.
In vitro, the gel/miR-302 complex led to proliferation in neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes in 
releasates collected as far out as 7 days. The reduction in proliferation from releasates 
collected after this time (D10, D15) could be due to RNA degradation given the extended 
time of the experiment. Remarkably, in vivo, our gel/miR-302 complex led to robust 
proliferation of cardiomyocytes at 5 and 14 days in the adult heart, a terminally 
differentiated organ. Expression of Aurora B kinase suggested that cardiomyocytes not only 
entered the cell cycle but were undergoing cytokinesis. Clonal expansion of newly generated 
cardiomyocytes was observed surrounding the infarct zone of the hearts treated with the gel/
miR-302 complex. The use of a multi-colored lineage reporter allowed us to verify the 
generation of new cardiomyocytes in comparison to simply observing an increase in 
proliferative markers. Our findings concur with recent data showing that small numbers of 
newly generated cardiomyocytes observed over the lifespan of mammals or after injury are 
due to proliferation of pre-existing cardiomyocytes rather than arising from a progenitor 
population.39 While these new cells may enhance contractility after MI, cardiomyocytes also 
play a role in limiting remodeling by signaling through paracrine factors to fibroblasts.49 
This explains the improvements in global cardiac volumes and function observed after 
delivery of the gel/miR-302 complex. Interestingly, while other gels have improved function 
after MI, no improvement was observed in our case. This may be related to the softness 
(~500 Pa) and relative rapid clearance of our gel in the heart. Previous gel formulations that 
led to cardiac bulking were stiffer with higher retention.23,25
The proliferative potential of the gel/miR-302 complex is further attributed to enhanced 
retention and sustained release of miR-302 mimics upon injection, particularly as there was 
minimal proliferation without gel. Complexing the miRNA with the gel likely protected the 
miRNA mimics from degradation by ubiquitous RNAse H mediated mechanisms, allowing 
for continuous and persistent release of active mimics. This work also builds on previous 
reports of intramyocardial miRNA injections, where miRNAs were injected naked, in a lipid 
complex with a transfection reagent.50,51 Since gels allow for a single application and have 
been well-tolerated in human trials,27 we believe the use of a gel/miRNA complex offers 
significant advantages to these other approaches. Other recent reports have also corroborated 
the benefit of hydrogels in promoting miRNA delivery to the heart, although with different 
therapeutic targets or with viral delivery.52,53

 Our research demonstrates the potential of a bioengineered miRNA delivery approach to 
promote cardiomyocyte proliferation and cardiac regeneration after MI. This delivery 
mechanism has distinct advantages over current methods including: (i) overcoming the short 
lifespan of injected mimics, (ii) use as a single application, (iii) optimization of release of 
miRNA mimics over times for promoting cardiomyocyte proliferation and cardiac 
regeneration, and (iv) potential for adaptation to percutaneous delivery through catheter. 
Currently, there are no approved treatments that regenerate myocardium; in this regard, our 
system may have unique advantages to other existing treatments for MI. Future studies to 
refine the gel/miRNA formulation in larger animal models of myocardial infarction are 
important to progress the gel formulation for in vivo delivery. Finally, this study establishes 
the proof-of-concept of a technology to permit minimally invasive, sustained miRNA 
delivery that can be tailored towards other small RNAs for application to cardiac and other 
tissues.
Methods
Material Synthesis
Sodium hyaluronate 74 kDa (LifeCore, Chaska, MN) was converted to a 
tetrabutylammonium salt (HA-TBA) by exchange against Dowex-100 resin and 
neutralization by tetrabutylammonium hydroxide. CD-HA and AD-HA were synthesized as 
previously described.24 Briefly, CD-HA was prepared by amidation between 6-(6-
aminohexyl)amino-6-deoxy-β-cyclodextrin and HA-TBA in the presence of benzotriazol-1-
yloxy)tris(dimethylamino)phosphoniumhexafluorophosphate (BOP). AD-HA was 
synthesized by esterification of HA-TBA with 1-adamantane acetic acid in di-tert-butyl 
bicarbonate (BOC2O) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). Products were dialyzed, 
frozen, and lyophilized prior to use. 1H NMR (Bruker) at 360MHz was used to determine 
final product modification, which was approximately 20% of HA disaccharide repeats for 
both CD-HA and AD-HA. Me-HA was synthesized by the esterification reaction between 
HA and methacrylic anhydride and maintenance of pH between 7.5–8.5 for 8 hours. Me-HA 
was then converted to a TBA salt (Me-HA-TBA) and subsequently modified with CD as 
previously mentioned. For Cy7.5 labeling, the fluorescent peptide GCKKG-Cy7.5 was 
synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis (Protein Technologies) using glycinol 2-
chlorotrityl resin and FMOC protected amino acids that was then reacted with the free acid 
of Cy7.5. To couple the peptide to CD-Me-HA, the peptide was added dropwise to CD-Me-
HA in PBS at pH 8 for four hours.
Rheological Characterization
Measurements were performed using an AR2000 stress-controlled rheometer (TA 
Instruments) fitted with a 20-mm diameter cone and plate geometry, 59 min 42 s cone angle, 
and 27 µm gap. Rheological properties were examined by time sweeps (1.0 Hz; 0.5% strain). 
For shear recovery experiments, shear-thinning was performed at 250% strain with recovery 
at 0.5% strain at 20 Hz.

3’-GGUGACUUUGUACCUUCGUGAA-Chol-5’ (Passenger)
Unmodified mimics did not have the cholesterol on the 5’ of the passenger strand.
Rhodamine Quenching Assay
Rhodamine B (50 ng/µL) was mixed with varying amounts of CD-HA (0–50 ng/µL) towards 
a final volume of 200 µL in DI H2O to determine saturating CD-HA concentrations for 
quenching. For unquenching assays, Rhodamine B (50 ng/µL) was quenched with 50 ng/µL 
CD-HA by mixing. Complexes were then mixed with miR-302 mimics (0–5 µM) in a final 
volume of 200 µL. Emission was measured on a Tecan Infinite200 96-well microplate reader 
at an excitation of 550 nm. miR-302b-chol affinity for Rho/CD-HA complexes was 
calculated by fit to the Benesi-Hildebrand equation.
miR-302 Release and Bioactivity
To form gels with miRNA mimics, CD-HA (3.2 mg) or AD-HA (2.1 mg) polymers were 
sterilized under UV and resuspended in solutions of miR-302b (210 µM) and miR-302c (210 
µM) in PBS under sterile conditions to a final polymer concentration of 5 wt%. Polymer/
miRNA solutions of CD-HA and AD-HA were mixed manually and centrifuged. Gels were 
incubated with OPTI-MEM in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes with 500 µL supernatants collected 
and replaced at D1, D4, D7, D10, D15 and D21. Total miRNA concentration in releasates 
was quantified by RiboGreen (ThermoFisher) according to manufacturer’s protocols. 
Briefly, 20 µL of releasate was incubated with Hi-Range RiboGreen Buffer in 1x TE buffer 
to a final volume of 200 µL and fluorescence was measured at excitation of 500 nm and 
emission of 520 nm on a Tecan Infinite200 96-well microplate reader.
Neonatal Cardiomyocyte Isolation and Culture
Ventricular cardiomyocytes from neonatal mice were isolated as described previously.17 
Briefly, ventricles from neonatal mice (postnatal day 0–3) were separated from atria, cut into 
pieces, and then subjected to trypsin (0.5%) digestion buffer in calcium free HBSS 
containing 10mM HEPES and 0.54 mM EDTA under constant stirring. After digestion for

 18 hours at 4°C, minced hearts were dissociated with calcium free HBSS supplemented with 
10% horse serum, 5% FBS, and 10mM HEPES. Cells were then washed with calcium free 
DMEM supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% FBS. After a final wash, the cells were 
plated on uncoated plastic dishes for 2 hours with media supplemented with 10% horse 
serum and 5% FBS. Non-attached cells were passed through a cell strainer (70 µm, BD 
Falcon) and seeded on a gelatin coated 96-well plate at a density of 15,000 cells/well. After 
incubation for 48 hours, the majority of cells started to beat. Mouse ventricular 
cardiomyocytes prepared using this procedure consistently yielded a purity of >90%. For 
proliferation assays, gel/miR-302 releasates or controls were added to cells in 96-well plates 
for 24 hours. After 48 hours, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, 
permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution for 10 
min, followed by 30 min blocking in 5% donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Cells 
were then stained overnight at 4°C with cardiac Troponin T (ThermoFisher, MS295) and 
Ki67 (Abcam, ab16667) primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution and then secondary 
antibodies conjugated to Alex Fluor488 and 555. Images were acquired with a Leica TCS 
SP8 microscope.
In Vivo Proliferation
Prior to use, polymers were sterilized under UV irradiation for 1 hour. Gels were formed 
with miRNAs as previously described and manually transferred to a 27-Gx½” U-100 
tuberculin syringe (Terumo) under sterile conditions on ice. Male C57BL/6 mice (7–9 
weeks) were selected to receive 10 µL total of gel or control injection (2 × 5 µL). Mice were 
anesthetized with 3% isoflurane in an induction chamber (2L) and endotracheally intubated 
(Harvard Apparatus Regenerative Technology) with 1% isoflurane. A left lateral 
thoracotomy was performed at the fourth intercostal space to expose the heart. Injections 
were made inferolateral to the proximal LAD without infarct. Following injection, the chest 
was closed in 3 layers with a 3-0 polypropylene suture and animals were allowed to recover. 
After 5 days, the heart was excised, briefly washed in PBS, weighed, fixed in 4% PFA, 
embedded in paraffin, and further processed for immunofluorescence. Slides were washed in 
PBS with 0.05% Tritron X-100 (TBST) and blocked in 10% goat serum followed by 
incubation with primary antibodies against: cardiac Troponin T (ThermoScientific, MS295), 
Ki67 (Abcam, ab16667), Histone H3 phosphorylated at serine10 (Cell Signaling, 9701), 
Aurora B kinase (LSBio, LSB6592), Yap (Cell Signaling, 4912S), von Willebrand Factor 
(Abcam, ab8822), Troponin I (Abcam, ab10231), ACTC1 (Abcam, ab46805). TUNEL 
staining (Invitrogen) was performed using the Click-iT Alexa Fluor596 kit according to 
manufacturer’s protocols. After 24 hours, sections were incubated with secondary antibodies 
conjugated to Alex Fluor488, 555 or 647 (Life Technologies). Nuclei were identified by 
counter-staining sections with DAPI (Vector Labs). Slides were then mounted in 
Vectashield. A series of confocal images (z-stack) were acquired either by Leica STED 
Super-Resolution Microscope or LSM 710 Zeiss. Images were analyzed and constructed by 
ImageJ software and Imaris (Bitplane). Cells were counted by two blinded independent 
investigators from a minimum of three representative sections per mouse. All animal 
procedures were performed in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee at the University of Pennsylvania.

 MicroRNA Extraction and Expression of miR-302 and Targets
Male C57BL/6 mice (7–9 weeks) were iinjected with either gel/miR-NC or gel/miR-302 (2 
× 5 µL). At set time points after intramyocardial injection, the mice were euthanized and the 
heart, lung, and liver were collected and rapidly snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA 
extraction. RNA isolation was performed as previously described.54 The Ambion mirVana 
miRNA Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher) was used to purify samples enriched with small RNA. 
Reverse transcription was performed with TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription kit 
(Applied Biosystems) with 3 µL RNA and RT primer sets (miR-302b: ID:000531) according 
to manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the TaqMan 
MicroRNA assay kit (Applied Biosystems). Primers used for Mob1, Lats2, and Mst1 were 
ordered from IDT. These primers were also used for qPCR amplification of these targets in 
neonatal cardiomyocytes.

Intraperitoneal tamoxifen (6.7mg/kg) single injection was used to induce stochastic labeling 
of cardiomyocytes in Myh6-MerCreMer/R26R-Confetti mice. Doses were titrated to ensure 
low levels of cardiomyocyte labeling so that individual clones could be identified. Two 
weeks after tamoxifen injection, hearts were accessed by thoracotomy and the left ventricle 
was infarcted by ligation of the left anterior descending artery. Mice were selected to receive 
gel/miR-302 or gel/miR-NC (2 × 5 µL) injections lateral to the infarct in the border zone. 28 
days post-surgery and miR302 injection, mice were euthanized to collect tissues. The hearts

 were fixed overnight with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA). After 24 hours, hearts were then 
transferred to 50% OCT, followed by continuous incubation in 100% OCT. Then hearts in 
OCT were frozen with dry ice and kept in −80 °C until sectioning. For WGA staining, 
sections were rehydrated and then incubated for one hour at room temperature with WGA 
conjugated to Alexa Fluor-647 (Life Technologies, W32466) in PBS. Slides were then 
rinsed in PBS and mounted in Vectashield.
Myocardial Infarction Model
Male C57BL/6 mice (7–9 weeks) were selected to receive 10 µL total of gel or control 
injection (2 × 5 µL). Mice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane in an induction chamber 
(2L) and endotracheally intubated (Harvard Apparatus Regenerative Technology) with 1% 
isoflurane. A left lateral thoracotomy was performed at the fourth intercostal space to expose 
the heart. The LAD was ligated 2 mm below the left auricle and infarction was visualized 
from blanching of the left ventricle. Injections were made lateral to the infarct. The chest 
was closed in 3 layers with a 3–0 polypropylene suture and animals were monitored during 
recovery for signs of stroke or embolization. The number of mice for gel/miR-302 treatment 
group was at least 11 males to give 80% power to detect an effect size of 1.3 SDs using a 
two-group t test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level. Injections were not blinded (due to 
variations in consistency between gel and PBS) or randomized.
Near-IR Heart Imaging
At D0, D1, D7, D14, and D28, mice were sacrificed and hearts were explanted and scanned 
on a LI-COR Pearl® Impulse Small Animal Imaging System (Lincoln, NE) with an 
excitation filter of 745 nm and emission filter for indocyanine green (ICG). Exposure time 
was set to 2 seconds and binning factor was set to 4. Intensity was expressed as radiant 
efficiency and the color scale was set to a minimum of 1 × 107 and maximum of 1 × 108. 
Total radiant efficiency (photons s−1 cm−2 steradian−1 per µW cm−2) over hearts was 
normalized by manual measurements over the fluorescent region of interest (ROI), 
subtracting background measurements, and normalizing to initial radiant efficiency 
measurements as previously described.55
Transthoracic Echocardiography
Mice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane induction following maintenance at 2% by nose 
cone. Hair was removed using Nair and limbs were taped onto the metal EKG leads. Echo 
was performed blinded using a VisualSonic Vevo 2100 system with a 40-MHz transducer for 
cardiac imaging. The transducer was placed parallel along the long axis of the left ventricle 
for a long axis view or rotated clockwise for short axis view. Images were analyzed using 
Vevo200 1.6 VisualSonic software. Left ventricular infernal diameters during systole 
(LVIDS) and diastole (LVIDD) were obtained from 2D M-mode imaging, where fractional 
shortening was calculated per the equation EF = [(LVIDD-LVIDS)/LVIDD]. Left ventricular 
end systolic volume (LVESV) and left ventricular end diastolic volume (LVEDV) were 
obtained from B-mode imaging by manually tracing the left ventricular endocardial border. 
Ejection fraction was calculated per the equation EF = [(LVEDV-LVESV)/LVEDV].

 Figure 1. Gel assembly and miR-302 interactions
a) HA was modified with AD or CD, which self-assemble into shear-thinning and self-
healing gels. Likewise, cholesterol on miR-302-chol interacts with CD to sustain release 
from the gel. b) Rhodamine/CD-HA interactions lead to quenching of rhodamine 
fluorescence, but the fluorescence is recovered by titration of cholesterol-modified miR-302 
into the system and displacement of rhodamine complexes, indicating complexation between 
cholesterol and CD. c) Release of cholesterol-modified miR-302b and miR-302c (210 µM of 
each) from gels (5 wt%) in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes over three weeks quantified by 
RiboGreen, a commercially available RNA quantification kit (mean ± SD, n=3).

 Figure 2. In vitro cardiomyocyte proliferation
a) Schematic of miR-302 supernatant collection and cardiomyocyte uptake. Gel/miR-302 
(100 µL) assemblies were formed in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes with cholesterol-modified 
miR-302 (210 µM of miR-302b and miR-302c) or miR-NC (420 µM). OPTI-MEM (500 µL) 
was added above gels and supernatant was collected, frozen, and replaced at D1, D4, D7, 
D10 and D15. Supernatants collected from each timepoint were added to primary neonatal 
cardiomyocytes in culture. At 48 hours, cardiomyocytes were stained for Ki67, cardiac 
Troponin T, and with DAPI to detect proliferation. b) Quantification of Ki67+cTnT+ 
neonatal cardiomyocytes from gel supernatants from D0-D1, D1-D4, D4-D7, D7-D10 and 
D10-D15 in vitro cultures demonstrating proliferative effects from early gel/miR-302 release 
out to 7 days (mean ± SD, n=3 per condition, *p<0.05). Quantification was based on 
counting of Ki67+cTnT+ co-stained cells relative to total cTnT+ cells per high power field 
(HPF). c) Representative images of Ki67+cTnT+ neonatal cardiomyocytes (yellow arrows) 
to demonstrate increased Ki67 staining up to 7 days after exposure to gel/miR-302. Scale 
bar: 25 µm.

 Figure 3. In vivo cardiomyocyte proliferation
a) Pre-formed gel (5 wt%, blue dye) injected from a 27Gx1/2” syringe into water, to 
demonstrate rapid reassembly and minimal dispersion of cargo upon injection. b) Schematic 
for intramyocardial gel injections into non-infarcted murine hearts. Two injections were 
made inferolateral to the proximal LAD below the left atrial appendage in non-infarcted 
mouse hearts after thoracotomy. At 5, 14, or 28 days, hearts were sectioned and stained for 
Troponin T and Ki67, pH3 or Aurora B. c) Representative images of Ki67 staining in 
cardiomyocytes (yellow arrows) and non-myocytes at D5, D14 or D28, demonstrating 
increased proliferation in gel/miR-302 treated hearts. Scale bar = 50 µm. d) Representative 
images of pH3 and Aurora B staining in cardiomyocytes (yellow arrows) at D5. Scale bar = 
50 µm. e) Quantification of cardiomyocytes (Ki67+cTnT+) from hearts treated with gel/miR-
NC or gel/miR-302, demonstrating sustained proliferation of cardiomyocytes f,g) 
Quantification of pH3 and Aurora B positive cardiomyocytes surrounding gel/miR-302 
injection sites demonstrating increased proliferation in gel/miR-302 treated groups. Scale 
bar = 50 µm (mean ± SD, n=3 animals per group, symbol shapes indicate each animal,

 Figure 4. Gel/miR-302 induced clonal expansion in vivo
a) Schematic representation of lineage-tracing strategy and experimental design. To trace 
clonal proliferation, mice were cross-bred with Myh6MerCreMer and R26RConfetti. The 
expression of Myh6 leads to Cre-loxP recombination with consequent random activation of 
one of four fluorescent reporter proteins (nGFP, YFP, RFP and mCFP) with each color 
representing a different clone from a Myh6 positive cardiomyocyte. In our experimental 
design, mice were injected with tamoxifen intraperitoneally to induce the stochastic 
expression of nGFP, RFP, YFP and mCFP. After 14 days, the LAD was ligated to induce 
ischemic injury and gels were injected in the border zone of the infarct downstream. At 28 
days after ligation, hearts were collected for analysis of clonal expansion. b) Mechanism for 
gel/miR-302 induced clonal expansion: 1) adult cardiomyocytes are non-proliferative and 
incapable of dividing after ischemic injury; 2) tamoxifen is used to randomly label a small 
population of cardiomyocytes with one of four fluorescent reporter proteins; 3) hearts are 
infarcted and gel/miR-302 is injected into cardiomyocytes in the border zone; and 4) 
miR-302 stimulates differentiation, proliferation, and expansion of fluorescently-labeled 
cardiomyocytes, which pass the fluorescent protein gene onto daughter cells. c) Fluorescent 
scans of gross heart specimens immediately after explanting at 28 days. Fluorescence is 
displayed in the green and red channels to indicate labeling of cardiomyocytes in both gel/
miR-NC and gel/miR-302 treated groups. Scale bar = 2 mm.

 Figure 5. Clonal expansion of Confetti-labeled cardiomyocytes in mice
a) Representative sections from confocal imaging with labeled cardiomyocytes expressing 
nGFP, RFP, or YFP. Gel/miR-NC sections consisted mostly of individual cardiomyocytes 
that were spatially separated. In gel/miR-302 treated groups, multiple clones were observed 
in all three fluorescent channels in close proximity, consisting of several daughter cells from 
a single parent cell. WGA separates individual cardiomyocytes and permits identification of 
clones, specifically to differentiate multiple cardiomyocytes from multi-nucleated 
cardiomyocytes. Scale bar = 50 µm. b) Quantification of cells to a clone in the nGFP, RFP, 
and YFP channels. Clones are identified as cells within 50 µm proximity to one another (gel/
miR-NC, n=3; gel/miR-302, n=4, symbol shapes indicate each animal, *p<0.05). Clones 
consisting of one cell are not technically clones but stochastically labeled single cells, but 
are still counted as part of the analysis to demonstrate they are the ubiquitous in the gel/miR-
NC groups.

 Figure 7. Functional outcomes after myocardial infarction in adult mice
a) End diastolic and b) end systolic volumes at 4 weeks after myocardial infarction in mice 
treated with PBS, gel/miR-NC, or gel/miR-302 by B-mode echocardiography. Volume 
increases were significantly decreased in gel/miR-302 treated groups compared to controls. 
c) Ejection fraction and d) fractional shortening at 4 weeks after myocardial infarction by 
echocardiography. Neither ejection fraction nor fractional shortening of gel/miR-302 treated 
mice were significantly different from non-infarcted mice. All groups were compared 
through 1-way ANOVA (Mean ± SD, no MI, n=10; PBS, n=13; gel/miR-NC, n=9, gel/
miR-302, n=12. *p<0.05 **p<0.01 ***p<0.001). Outliers were removed using the robust 
regression and outlier removal method (ROUT) in Prism. e) Representative Masson’s 
trichrome sections demonstrating cardiac volume improvement at 28 days. Sections are 
arranged from ligation to the apex to visualize changes in tissue remodeling. Scale bar 
(sections)= 2 mm. Scale bar (gross) = 5 mm. Representative gross heart pictures at D28 are 
also shown. f) Quantification of infarct size from gross sections. Infarct size was calculated 
from a minimum of three sections per animal where the scar was well-represented and 
expressed as Infarct Area (%) = (Infarct Area)/(Total Section Area). g) M-mode 
echocardiographs of left ventricular anterior and posterior walls demonstrating diminished 
motion in anterior wall of gel/miR-NC treated mice with improvement in gel/miR-302 
treated mice.
