Abstract
OBJECTIVES—To estimate the proportion of older adults in the emergency department (ED) 
who are willing and able to use a tablet computer to answer questions.
DESIGN—Prospective, ED-based cross-sectional study.
SETTING—Two U.S. academic EDs.
PARTICIPANTS—Individuals aged 65 and older.
MEASUREMENTS—As part of screening for another study, potential study participants were 
asked whether they would be willing to use a tablet computer to answer eight questions instead of 
answering questions orally. A custom user interface optimized for older adults was used. Trained

 research assistants observed study participants as they used the tablets. Ability to use the tablet 
was assessed based on need for assistance and number of questions answered correctly.
RESULTS—Of 365 individuals approached, 248 (68%) were willing to answer screening 
questions, 121 of these (49%) were willing to use a tablet computer; of these, 91 (75%) were able 
to answer at least six questions correctly, and 35 (29%) did not require assistance. Only 14 (12%) 
were able to answer all eight questions correctly without assistance. Individuals aged 65 to 74 and 
those reporting use of a touchscreen device at least weekly were more likely to be willing and able 
to use the tablet computer. Of individuals with no or mild cognitive impairment, the percentage 
willing to use the tablet was 45%, and the percentage answering all questions correctly was 32%.
CONCLUSION—Approximately half of this sample of older adults in the ED was willing to 
provide information using a tablet computer, but only a small minority of these were able to enter 
all information correctly without assistance. Tablet computers may provide an efficient means of 
collecting clinical information from some older adults in the ED, but at present, it will be 
ineffective for a significant portion of this population.

elderly; emergency department; data collection; aged
Older adults in the United States make more than 20 million emergency department (ED) 
visits annually.1 Many older adults have unmet and often undiagnosed needs that negatively 
affect quality of life and health outcomes.2,3 Developing tools to identify and address these 
needs efficiently is a priority of geriatric emergency medicine research.4,5 Collecting 
accurate clinical information from older adults in the ED is vital to these efforts, but it is a 
labor-intensive process.
Mobile computing devices with a touchscreen interface have the potential to reduce the time 
required of ED personnel in collecting clinical information from older adults. These devices 
have been adopted for collecting information in a wide variety of commercial settings, 
including healthcare, and the feasibility of this approach has been demonstrated in the ED,6 
primary care,7 and specialty clinics,8,9 with accuracy comparable with that of self-completed 
paper surveys.10,11 In the ED, these interventions are acceptable to most individuals,12 with 
more than 90% of adults in the ED preferring a technology-based approach in one study,13 
and 93% reporting comfort using a computer for an alcohol use reduction program,14 but 
older adults differ from younger adults with regard to their familiarity with the use of 
electronic devices and in the prevalence of physical and cognitive impairments that might 
make these devices hard to use. Although it has been demonstrated that individuals with 
mild dementia,15 arthritis,11 and visual impairment16 can learn to use tablet computers, the 
extent to which older adults in the ED who have not received specific training are willing 
and able to use such devices to provide clinical information is unknown. The current study 
was designed to estimate the proportion of older adults in the ED who were willing and able 
to use a touchscreen tablet computer to provide answers to basic demographic and clinical 
questions.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design, Setting, and Selection of Participants
This was a cross-sectional study of adults aged 65 and older receiving care at two academic 
EDs (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina; Cooper University 
Hospital, Camden, New Jersey) in the United States that serve a racially and economically 
diverse population of older adults. EDs were located in two regions (southeast, northeast). 
The primary purpose of the study was to obtain estimates of the proportion of older adults in 
the ED who were willing and able to use a tablet computer to provide clinical information. 
Enrollment occurred between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. 7 days a week for 2 months at each site. 
Individuals aged 65 and older were identified by review of each ED’s electronic tracking 
board. Individuals were excluded if they were critically ill, had altered mental status, were 
on a psychiatric hold, or did not speak English. Individuals were considered critically ill if 
their emergency severity index triage score was 1 or based on the judgment of the treating 
emergency provider. Altered mental status was considered present if the individual had a 
chief complaint of altered mental status, confusion, or delirium; a cognitive test was not used 
to determine eligibility. (The Six Item Screener was administered in a subset of individuals, 
but this information was collected after the tablet was offered to the individuals and was not 
used as an exclusion criterion.) The institutional review boards at both sites approved the 
study. Data presented here were collected as part of an assessment of eligibility for another 
study assessing accuracy of self-reported ability to complete a simple mobility task.17 
Accordingly, all individuals in this sample had orally expressed a willingness to be screened 
to determine eligibility to be in a study. Consent to participate did not occur until after the 
tablet questions were offered to the individual, and consent was not a requirement for 
inclusion in this study.
Data Collection
Research assistants (RAs) collected data in in-person interviews. Before beginning the study, 
RAs were required to complete training in clinical research and demonstrate understanding 
of the study protocol. After this training, study investigators (SB, VAB) observed each RA 
until he or she demonstrated proficiency.
Each person who agreed to answer screening questions was asked, “Are you willing to use 
the tablet computer to answer these questions?” to determine whether he or she was willing 
to answer eight questions on a tablet. Participants were not informed that this was an 
important question in the study. Rather, the question was presented as, “We need this 
information. Are you willing to use the tablet?” For participants who agreed to use the 
tablet, the first two questions were designed to ensure that the person could use the tablet 
(e.g., mark the letter C). The next three questions assessed basic demographic information 
(age, sex, race). The final three questions assessed orientation (day of week, month, year). If 
participants were not willing to answer questions using the tablet, the relevant questions 
were asked orally. At the end of each survey, each participant who was willing to attempt to 
use the tablet was asked whether he or she would prefer to complete surveys such as this in 
an in-person interview or on a tablet computer. Tablet computers were chosen for data 
collection because they are small, portable, and lightweight. Additionally, because there is

 no physical keyboard, it is easier to clean than a conventional laptop computer; tablet 
computers were sanitized after each use using alcohol-based disinfectant wipes. Three 
tablets were used to collect data in this study: one ASUS Transformer TF101 (ASUSTeK 
Computer, Inc., Taipei, Taiwan), one Apple iPad Mini, and one Apple fourth-generation iPad 
(Apple, Inc., Cupertino, CA). Tablet questions were presented, and participant responses 
were recorded using an online survey instrument (Qualtrics, Provo, Utah). Responses were 
then transferred manually to a secure database (REDCap).
Outcomes and Analysis
The primary outcomes were willingness and ability to use a tablet. Willingness to use the 
tablet was determined based on the participant’s yes or no response to the above question. 
Ability to use a tablet was characterized by use of the tablet without assistance, how many of 
the eight assessment survey questions were answered correctly, whether six or more of eight 
questions were answered correctly, and whether all eight questions were answered correctly 
without assistance. The RAs observed each participant the entire time they used the tablet 
and indicated whether participants needed assistance in operating the device. Examples of 
assistance included the RA holding the tablet for the participant, reading the survey to the 
participant, or explaining to the participant how to scroll down on the screen to see the next 
question. RAs were instructed not to enter responses on behalf of participants or tell 
participants the answer to a question (i.e., this level of assistance was not allowed). 
Regardless of whether the participant was willing or able to use the tablet, the RA collected 
information about each participant’s prior experience using computing devices.
The Six-Item Screener for cognitive assessment was administered to a subset of participants 
in this study. A post hoc subgroup analysis was conducted on the subset of participants with 
a Six-Item Screener score of 4 or more, indicating no or mild cognitive impairment.18
Results are reported as medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) or percentages with 95% 
confidence intervals overall, according to sociodemographic characteristics, and according 
to prior exposure to technology. The chi-square test was used to examine differences in 
willingness of specific participant subgroups to use a tablet computer. Results significant at 
the P ˂ .05 level are reported in the results without adjustment for multiple testing. 
Assuming that approximately 20% of study participants would be willing and able to use the 
tablet for data entry, enrolling at least 240 participants would provide 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) within 5% of the point estimate for the percentage of participants willing and 
able to use the tablet. All data analysis was conducted using Stata version 14.0 (Stata Corp, 
College Station, TX).
RESULTS
Of the 365 individuals who were approached, 248 (69%) were willing to participate (Figure 
1). Of these 248 individuals, 121 (49%, 95% CI = 43–55%) were willing to use a tablet to 
answer the questions. Older adults were less likely to agree to use a tablet (P = .002; Table 
1). Individuals who reported using a computer or touchscreen device at least once a week 
were more likely to agree to use a tablet (P < .001).

 For the 121 individuals willing to use a tablet, median completion time was 3 minutes (IQR 
1 minute, 50 seconds-5 minutes, 5 seconds); 29% (95% CI = 21–37%) did not require 
assistance, 75% (95% CI = 67–83%) answered six or more questions correctly; 32% (95% 
CI = 23–49%) answered all eight questions correctly, and 12% (95% CI = 7–19%) answered 
all questions correctly without assistance. Individuals aged 85 and older took longer to 
answer the questions. The percentage of participants who answered six or more of the eight 
questions correctly was higher in whites than blacks (P = .02) and higher in those who 
reported weekly use of a touchscreen device than those who did not (P < .001) (Table 2). Of 
the initial 248 individuals who agreed to answer questions, only 39 (32%, 95% CI = 23–
40%) were willing to use the tablet and able to answer all eight questions without assistance.
Overall, 87% of individuals who used a tablet indicated they were willing to use a tablet 
again for data entry, but if given the choice, 75% of those who used a tablet stated they 
would prefer a verbal interview rather than tablet entry in the future. The preference for a 
verbal interview was particularly strong in individuals aged 85 and older (93%). The 
majority of participants indicated that they liked using the tablet computer for data entry 
(71%), although 16% were neutral, and 13% disliked using the tablet, including nine (8%) 
participants who indicated that they strongly disliked it (Figure 2).
Of the 248 study participants, 153 had cognition assessed using the Six Item Screener. Of 
these 153, 140 (92%) had a score of 4 or more, indicating no or mild cognitive impairment, 
and 85 (56%) had a score of 6. Of the 140 participants with no or mild cognitive 
impairment, 63 (45%) were willing to try to use the tablet, and 20 (32%) of the 63 answered 
all tablet questions correctly (Appendix Tables S1 and S2). Furthermore, 56% of this subset 
of participants with no or mild cognitive impairment entered an age using the tablet 
computer that matched their orally reported age. Eighty-two percent of these participants 
would be willing to use a tablet again to answer questions, but, as with the entire sample, 
78% stated that they would prefer to provide information in an interview.
DISCUSSION
Approximately half of this sample of individuals in the ED aged 65 and older approached 
for participation in the parent study were willing to use a tablet. Of the willing, the majority 
required assistance in completing the questionnaire and were unable to answer all eight 
questions correctly. Participant factors associated with better performance included younger 
age, white race, and prior technology use. Overall, participants liked using the tablet for data 
entry, but the majority would prefer a traditional face-to-face interview in the future. These 
results are consistent with those of prior studies of data entry using tablet computers, which 
found worse data accuracy in older individuals and differences based on race and prior 
technology use.6,7
Fifty-one percent of older adults in the current study were willing to use a tablet, and many 
of those had difficulty providing correct responses, with 32% correctly answering all 
questions. Of participants with mild or no cognitive impairment, 45% were willing to try to 
use the tablet, and 32% answered all questions correctly. Of the subset of participants who 
were cognitively intact, 56% correctly reported their age, suggesting that these participants

 had difficulty using the tablet to enter this information. These findings indicate the presence 
of substantial barriers to incorporation of this technology in the routine care of older adults. 
Observed reasons for participants marking the wrong answer included difficulty touching the 
desired spot on the screen and difficulty getting the tablet to register when they touched the 
screen. In some cases, it appeared the person had difficulty reading the question but did not 
feel comfortable asking the RA for assistance. Individuals aged 65 to 74 were more willing 
to use a tablet, less likely to require assistance, more likely to get answers right, and more 
likely to state they would be willing to use this technology again than those aged 75 and 
older. Similar to previous findings,15 these differences based on participant age may 
represent a greater comfort with and exposure to handheld technology of younger elderly 
adults, because this age group was more likely to use technology weekly. It is likely that the 
observed unwillingness or inability of many of the oldest adults to use tablet computers may 
be related to factors associated with age, particularly prior exposure to this technology, 
rather than age itself. Over the next two decades, as the current middle-aged population 
become older adults, it is likely that a larger proportion of older adults will be comfortable 
with this technology, although other problems that increase with age, such as visual 
problems and loss of dexterity, are likely to remain present in this next generation of older 
adults and may restrict use of this technology for some individuals.
The use of tablet computers for direct data entry by individuals for clinical assessments or 
data collection in a study has several advantages. First, this approach reduces time required 
of clinical providers or research assistants. Second, people are generally more likely to 
disclose sensitive personal information when answering self-administered questions than in 
a face-to-face interview.19,20 Thus, assessments of common but sensitive problems of older 
adults in the ED such as elder abuse or neglect, depression, or unmet nonmedical needs may 
be more accurate using tablet computers.3 Third, the use of tablet computers for assessments 
has the potential to facilitate broad, consistent dissemination of screening instruments or 
questionnaires. Furthermore, if older adults can provide accurate information using tablet 
computers, they may be able to provide self-supplied information such as demographic and 
medical history directly into electronic health records.
This study has several limitations. First, there were slight differences between the tablets. 
The devices had displays that differed slightly in size, contrast, resolution, and sensitivity of 
the screen to touch. The two Apple iPad tablets offered a zoom function within the survey 
that the ASUS Transformer did not; this may have assisted participants with visual 
impairment. The iPad Mini was slightly smaller, which resulted in smaller final rendered 
text, whereas the iPad Mini was lighter and presumably easier for participants to handle. 
Additionally, although both had contrasting text and background, the Apple devices had dark 
text on white background, and the ASUS device had the opposite. This difference may have 
affected legibility.21 Tablet computers with large-text options and easy-to-use operating 
systems have been developed specifically for use by older adults.22 Use of such tablets may 
have yielded different results. One participant had difficulty using the tablet because she had 
long acrylic nails. Providing a stylus, which was not done in this study, may make the tablet 
easier for some people to use. Level of formal education, which has been shown to affect 
performance on electronic questionnaires, was not assessed.6,7 Study subjects were 
predominantly white, which may limit generalizability to more ethnically diverse

 populations. Delirium,23,24 which may have been present in some participants and may have 
contributed to unwillingness or inability to use the tablet, was not assessed for. Only 
English-speaking people seeking care between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. at two academic EDs in the 
United States were included. Willingness and ability to use tablets computers may be 
different for non-English speakers and for older adults seeking care in other settings. 
Participants who were unwilling to use the tablet were also less likely to use technology on a 
regular basis. This would not affect the estimate of the percentage of people who are willing 
and able to use a tablet but would limit the generalizability of the estimate of the percentage 
of people who are able to use a tablet to those who are willing to use it. This study was 
conducted in 2014, at which time an estimated 18% of U.S. adults aged 65 and older and 
49% of adults aged 35 to 44 owned tablets. It is likely that, when younger generations turn 
65, a larger percentage of these individuals will be comfortable with tablets and other forms 
of electronic data entry than the current population of older adults.
Finally, there was neither penalty nor reward attached to using the tablet device. In other 
settings, such as selfcheckout lines in a grocery store and automated voice response systems 
for telephone calls, people make choices regarding the use of the system based on penalties 
and rewards. One might choose to use the self-checkout lane in a grocery store because it is 
quicker even though it requires more effort, but might choose to pay a premium to speak to a 
human agent rather than endure frustration with an automated voice response system. 
Similarly, if use of a tablet was associated with some other improved service (e.g., 
completion expedites access to a physician), the willingness of people to use these devices 
(or find someone to help them use these devices) might change. Similarly, penalties or 
rewards for accurate data entry might also influence the quality of the information obtained.
Approximately half of this sample of older adults in the ED were willing to provide clinical 
information using a tablet computer, but only a small portion of these were able to enter all 
information correctly without assistance. Tablet computers may provide an efficient means 
of collecting clinical information from some older adults in the ED, but at present will likely 
be ineffective for a significant portion of this population. Nonetheless, if a substantial subset 
of older adults is willing and able to use these devices, it would result in significant labor 
savings for some clinical processes and research studies.
