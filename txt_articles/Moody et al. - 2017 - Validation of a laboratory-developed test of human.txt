Sperm must undergo capacitation to become fertilization competent. Here we validated that
monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1) localization patterns, which were assessed in the Cap-
Score™ Sperm Function Test, reflect a capacitated state in human sperm. First, we defined
patterns representing sperm that do or do not respond to stimuli for capacitation. Sperm with
“capacitated” patterns had exposed acrosomal carbohydrates and underwent acrosome
exocytosis in response to calcium ionophore (A23187). Precision was evaluated by percent
change of the Cap-Score measured for 50, 100, 150, and 200 sperm. Changes of 11%, 6%, and
5% were observed (n ≥ 23); therefore, we counted ≥150 sperm per condition. Variance within
and between readers was evaluated using 20 stitched image files generated from unique
ejaculates. Two trained readers randomly resampled each image 20 times, reporting an average
standard deviation of 3 Cap-Score units and coefficient of variation of 13% when rescoring
samples, with no difference between readers. Semen liquefaction times ≤2 hr and mechanical
liquefaction with Pasteur or wide-orifice transfer pipettes did not alter Cap-Score values.
However, liquefaction with chymotrypsin (p = 0.002) and bromelain (p = 0.049) reduced
response to capacitating stimuli and induced membrane damage, while counterintuitively
improving sperm motility. Together, these data validate the Cap-Score assay for the intended
purpose of providing information on sperm capacitation and male fertility. In addition to its
clinical utility as a diagnostic tool, this test of sperm function can reveal the impact of common
practices of semen handling on the ability of sperm to respond to capacitation stimuli.

| INTRODUCTION
Current literature estimates the number of infertile couples to be 73
million globally, with over 40% attributed to a male factor (Kumar &
Singh, 2015). Standard semen analysis—assessing sperm count,
motility, and morphology—diagnoses less than 50% of all male
infertility. Most infertile men are instead believed to have defects in
sperm function, which are only diagnosed by repeated failed cycles of
intrauterine insemination (Aboulghar et al., 2001; Practice Committee
of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, 2006; Tournaye,

 2012). Traditional semen analysis does not test for sperm function and,
as such, cannot report on the ability of sperm in that semen sample to
fertilize (Lamb, 2010; Wang & Swerdloff, 2014). Tests of sperm
function would therefore have enormous clinical impact in helping
physicians counsel couples to the most appropriate form of assisted
reproduction; indeed, the development of assays of sperm fertilizing
ability are a recognized priority (Lamb, 2010; Oehninger, Franken, &
Ombelet, 2014; Wang & Swerdloff, 2014).
Although freshly ejaculated spermatozoa appear morphologically
mature and motile, they are fertilization incompetent until they
undergo a maturational process known as “capacitation” (Austin, 1952;
Chang, 1951). In most species, capacitation is dependent on the
removal of sterols from the sperm plasma membrane (sterol efflux) and
the influx of bicarbonate and calcium ions (Baldi et al., 1991;
Bedu-Addo, Lefièvre, Moseley, Barratt, & Publicover, 2005; Cohen
et al., 2014; Gadella & Van Gestel, 2004). The efflux of sterols that
occurs during sperm capacitation changes membrane fluidity, allowing
for the redistribution of specific membrane components (Cohen et al.,
2014; Cross, 1998; Selvaraj et al., 2007, 2009).
The Cap-Score™ Sperm Function Test (Cap-Score) is an in vitro,
laboratory-developed
test
designed
to
assess
sperm
function,
particularly regarding capacitation. This assay detects and analyzes
the localization patterns of the ganglioside GM1 to evaluate the
fertilizing ability of sperm. Conducting a Cap-Score test involves the
incubation of sperm in non-capacitating (Non-Cap) medium and
medium containing capacitating stimuli (Cap). The sperm that respond
to the capacitation stimuli are identified by specific GM1 localization
patterns. The final readout—the “Cap-Score”—reports the proportion
of sperm within a sample that display the localization patterns that
correspond with capacitation.
Validation of diagnostic assays involves multiple steps, typically
measuring assay precision, reproducibility, and accuracy (Cleophas &
Zwinderman, 2012). “Accuracy” is used in different ways, including for
demonstration of “fit for purpose,” demonstration that the assay
quantifies its intended target, and demonstration of statistical
accuracy or quantification within an acceptable range of uncertainty.
The process of validating an assay without precedent (such as the Cap-
Score) is more complex than for an assay that simply alters the
methodology of an established “gold standard” test: an assay of a novel
biomarker must be reproducible and precise within samples and
between readers. Other endpoints or markers of capacitation must
also be used to support the underlying assertion—in this case, that the
“capacitated” GM1 localization pattern is actually identifying a
capacitated sperm. Finally, clinical and population data are required
to show that the capacitation status provides information on male
fertility (“fit for purpose”).
Relevant to the question of whether or not the Cap-Score assay
provides information on male fertility, it is important to note that GM1
localization patterns have been tested in an independent, post hoc
clinical trial using a combination of retrospective and prospective
medical histories analyzed after performing the assay (Cardona et al.,
2017). In that study, Cap-Scores over a certain threshold were highly
correlated with successful fertilization by natural conception or within
three or fewer cycles of intrauterine insemination, and Cap-Scores
below that threshold were correlated with low fertilization success
(Cardona et al., 2017). Because that trial was performed with a highly
skewed patient population consistent with a tertiary care fertility
clinic, cohort comparison data were also collected, comparing the
distribution of Cap-Scores in a population of men with known fertility
versus those questioning their fertility. Significantly more men
questioning their fertility had Cap-Scores at or below one standard
deviation below the normal mean (Cardona et al., 2017). Together, the
data from those studies demonstrate the fitness of the test for its
intended purpose. Indeed, capacitation status is reflected by the Cap-
Score using the ultimate endpoint or criterion of capacitation—the
acquisition of fertilizing ability. However, one needs to interrogate
those specific cells with other methods to look at capacitation status to
prove that the individual sperm with “capacitated” patterns are
actually capacitated.
During capacitation, the plasma membrane and outer acrosomal
membranes are reported to communicate, thereby exposing some
molecules associated with the acrosome (Asano, Nelson-Harrington, &
Travis, 2013; Cohen, Mukai, & Travis, 2016; Jin et al., 2011; Kim &
Gerton, 2003; Kim, Foster, Kvasnicka, & Gerton, 2011). Capacitated
sperm are also able to undergo acrosome exocytosis. Here we utilized
the established tools of peanut agglutinin (PNA), a lectin that binds
specific
carbohydrate
residues
associated
with
the
acrosome
(Mortimer, Curtis, & Miller, 1987; Vázquez et al., 1996), and calcium
ionophore (A23187), which causes calcium influx into sperm and
induces acrosome exocytosis. Use of these or similar reagents can
provide mutually reinforcing evidence of the capacitation status of
sperm, and allow us to correlate these states to specific patterns of
GM1 localization. For example, we previously showed that murine
sperm exhibiting a specific pattern of GM1 localization were the same
population that underwent acrosome exocytosis, confirming that the
pattern in question reflected the capacitation status of those cells
(Selvaraj et al., 2007).
Assay reproducibility and precision pose special problems when
dealing with the highly heterogeneous populations of human sperm.
The World Health Organization has published multiple guidelines to
reduce subjectivity in evaluations of male fertility and standardize
routine semen analysis (World Health Organization, 1999, 2010).
Nonetheless, differences still exist within and among individual
andrologists (Auger et al., 2000), raising the question of whether
observed differences in semen quality are real or simply reflect
modifications in processing or measurement methods (Knuth,
Neuwinger, & Nieschlag, 1989). To improve the identification and
treatment of male fertility, semen quality evaluations should
demonstrate minimal variation both within single samples and
when read by different individuals. This attribute is known as
“precision,” which refers to how well a given measurement can be
reproduced when applied repeatedly to multiple aliquots of a single
homogeneous sample (Burd, 2010). Changes in precision (also
referred to as random analytical error) result entirely from factors
that may vary during normal operation of an assay. Larger sample
sizes often lead to increased precision, particularly when estimating
unknown parameters. For example, to estimate the proportion of
sperm having intact acrosomes within an ejaculate, a more precise

 estimate is obtained when 100 rather than 50 cells are sampled.
However,

diminishing returns and constitutes an unnecessary investment of
time.
Handling techniques, such as semen liquefaction, must also be
considered to ensure that differences in cell preparation that could
cause changes in the assay readout are avoided. According to the
World Health Organization guidelines, most semen samples should
liquefy on their own within 15 min at room temperature. However,
samples can be liquefied for up to 60 min at 37°C. And, if samples are
not liquefied after 60 min, liquefaction may be induced by: (i) diluting
the sample (1:1) with medium; (ii) repeatedly passing the sample
through an 18 or 19 gauge needle or pipette (mechanical liquefaction);
or (iii) treating the samples with enzymes such as chymotrypsin or
bromelain (Mortimer, 1994; World Health Organization, 2010).
Interestingly, certain liquefaction treatments affect seminal plasma
biochemistry and semen parameters (World Health Organization,
2010). For example, increasing liquefaction time can decrease
progressive motility in sperm (Mortimer, Swan, & Mortimer, 1998;
Shao et al., 2010) and increase DNA fragmentation (Balasuriya, Serhal,
Doshi, & Harper, 2012). Increases in sperm DNA fragmentation were
also observed when mechanical liquefaction is performed with
18-gauge needles (Kussler et al., 2014).
Enzymatic liquefaction of semen is an alternative to extended
time or mechanical methods. Chymotrypsin is a proteolytic enzyme
that cleaves amide bonds alongside hydrophobic amino acids
(tyrosine, tryptophan, phenylalanine), and is commonly used to
treat hyperviscous semen samples (Mortimer, 1994). Non-viscous
and viscous specimens exposed to chymotrypsin have shown little if
any
change
in
total
motility,
forward
progression
motility,
concentration, pH, or volume, but do exhibit a slight change in
sperm motility patterns (Chen, Lu, Xu, Huang, & Lu, 2006). Increased
levels of α-glucosidase activity, a biomarker that is positively
correlated with semen quality (Said, Galeraud-Denis, Carreau, &
Saad, 2009; Zöpfgen et al., 2000), are also observed following
liquefaction with chymotrypsin (Xu et al., 2006), further supporting
the minimal impact of chymotrypsin on semen quality. Bromelain, a
thiol proteolytic enzyme found in the stem of pineapples, has also
been used to treat viscous seminal plasma from dromedary camels,
and did not affect sperm motility (Monaco et al., 2016). This enzyme
also has anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, and anti-metastatic
properties (Chobotova, Vernallis, & Majid, 2010; Maurer, 2001;
Metzig, Grabowska, Eckert, Rehse, & Maurer, 1999; Taussig &
Batkin, 1988). Yet, very little research has focused on bromelain and
its effect on human seminal parameters, such as morphology, sperm
count, or sperm function, although it is being investigated/used
anecdotally to treat hyperviscosity.
The present study provides a series of experiments that
contribute to assay validation for the Cap-Score. First, cell biological
experiments were performed to demonstrate assay accuracy. Large
image files were generated, and two different readers were trained
to determine Cap-Score. The data generated were analyzed to
evaluate Cap-Score precision and its variation when determined by
the same and different operators. In addition, the Cap-Score was
utilized to determine if the length of time of liquefaction, mechanical
liquefaction, and enzymatic liquefaction affect capacitation.

| RESULTS
2.1 | Accuracy
The Cap-Score detects and analyzes localization patterns of the
ganglioside GM1, which differ in sperm that respond to stimuli for
capacitation. Typical GM1 localization patterns in sperm that either
have responded to stimuli for capacitation (GM1/CP), or have either not
been exposed to—or have not responded to—such stimuli (GM1/NCP)
are shown (Figure 1a,b). Because human sperm are so heterogeneous,
with many abnormal cells, a great many patterns can be seen beyond
these two; one such example is shown in Figure 1b. However, we
focused on the two patterns that are the keys for scoring.
Although the GM1/CP pattern reproducibly appeared in sperm
from different fertile men following exposure to stimuli for capacita-
tion, and was correlated with clinical fertility (Cardona et al., 2017),
those findings did not prove that the sperm having the GM1/CP pattern
were indeed capacitated. We therefore incubated sperm under non-
capacitating
(Non-Cap)
and
capacitating
(Cap)
conditions,
and
performed dual labeling with cholera toxin beta subunit (CTB) and
PNA to investigate the relationship between capacitation and patterns
of GM1 localization at the level of single cells (Figure 1b). Under Non-
Cap
conditions,
the
typical
GM1/NCP
pattern
predominated
(68.3 ± 3%; n = 10). Most of the cells with the GM1/NCP pattern did
not label with PNA, regardless of the treatment condition (Figure 1c,d);
this is consistent with an intact plasma membrane. The percentage of
sperm having the GM1/CP pattern increased from 16.3 ± 2.5% (n = 10)
under Non-Cap
conditions
to 28.0 ± 2.6%
(n = 10)
under Cap
conditions. Of great interest, the majority of cells with the GM1/CP
pattern did label with PNA over the acrosome (Figure 1c,d).
Acquiring the ability to exocytose the acrosome is a hallmark of
capacitated sperm. If the Cap-Score did in fact reflect the sperm that
were capacitated, we hypothesized that the Cap-Score should
decrease following treatment with a calcium ionophore, which can
trigger acrosome exocytosis in sperm that have undergone capacita-
tion. A decrease in Cap-Score (vs. sperm from that same sample
incubated under Cap conditions, but no ionophore) would be the
predicted consequence of exocytosis, which disrupts the plasma
membrane overlying the acrosome, preventing labeling or resulting in
atypical, “other” GM1 patterns. Incubating sperm under capacitation
conditions with the calcium ionophore A23187, we found the Cap-
Score indeed decreased (Figure 2a,b). This finding is consistent with
the model that cells undergoing acrosome exocytosis originated from
the sub-population with a GM1/CP pattern, and fit with earlier studies
in the mouse showing that only the sub-population of sperm
possessing the GM1/CP pattern was capable of undergoing acrosome
exocytosis (Selvaraj et al., 2007). Sperm incubated in basal (Non-Cap)
medium only, and then treated with A23187, showed no change in
Cap-Score (Figure 2c,d), supporting the notion that only capacitated
cells are capable of acrosome exocytosis.

 2.2 | Precision
Precision is defined as the repeatability or reproducibility of a
measurement performed on the same sample (JCGM/WG2, 2008;
Taylor & Cohen, 1998). The first step in determining Cap-Score
precision was to define the number of cells to count per sample. In
general, as the number of cells counted increases, there is an increase
in precision, up to a point when the Cap-Score will not change
appreciably with additional observations. We defined this threshold by
measuring the percent change in Cap-Score when 50, 100, 150, and
200 sperm were evaluated. The percent change was large when
counting 50 versus 100 sperm compared to counting 100 versus 150
and 150 versus 200 sperm (Table 1). Thus, Cap-Score precision was
only modestly improved by counting more than 100 sperm; however,
the 95% confidence intervals for the percent change when counting
50 versus 100 and 150 versus 200 did not overlap, suggesting a
significant reduction in percent change when at least 150 cells were
counted. A conservative Cap-Score value was therefore determined
by counting the GM1 localization patterns of at least 150 cells.
2.3 | Statistical accuracy and reproducibility within a
sample
Statistical accuracy can be defined as the proximity of measurements to
the true value. The true value of an unknown population can be
estimated byitscentraltendency, orthe mean.Onecan judgewhethera
dataset has a strong or a weak central tendency based on its dispersion,
or the inverse of precision (JCGM/WG2, 2008). The standard deviation
and coefficient of variation (coefficient of variation = standard devia-
tion/mean) measure the amount of dispersion within a sample.
Prior to evaluating Cap-Score accuracy by the same reader, we
estimated the number of images for each reader to sample. Two semen
donor groups were defined based on a cut-off of 1 standard deviation
below the mean Cap-Score for a population of men with presumed
fertility (pregnant wife or child less than 3 years old). The mean
Cap-Score for the group with “lower Cap-Scores” was 27 and the
“presumed fertile” group was 40. The standard deviations for each
group were 5.2 and 4.9, respectively. A power analysis using a two-
tailedtest was doneat the p < 0.05 andp < 0.01 levels, with a probability

PNA (None), labeling over the equatorial region (EQ); and labeling over the acrosome (ACR). (c and d) GM1 localization was compared to PNA
labeling in sperm incubated under Non-Cap (n = 10) and Cap (n = 10) conditions. Black, gray, and white bars represent the proportion of cells
with a given CTB labeling pattern having ACR, EQ, and None PNA label, respectively. Means within a given pattern of GM1 localization were
compared. Those means with different superscripts were found to be different using Fisher’s LSD (p < 0.05). In general, the majority of sperm
with the GM1/NCP pattern did not label with PNA in both treatment conditions. In contrast, sperm with the GM1/CP pattern predominantly
showed PNA labeling over the acrosome

(1-beta = 0.90). These analyses indicated that, respectively, 10 and 14
images should be sampled (five and seven per group). We therefore
generated 10 images each in the “lower Cap-Score” and “presumed
fertile” groups to ensure that each was sufficiently interrogated to
identify any differences in reproducibility that might occur because of
either low- or high-value Cap-Scores. Two different readers determined
Cap-Scoresby randomly resamplingthe10 imageseach from the “lower

standard deviation across images and readers was 3 while the average
coefficientofvariationwas13%(Figure3a).Boththestandarddeviation
andcoefficient ofvariationshowedalinearrelationshiptoCap-Score,as
determined by linear regression. Thus, while there was greater
dispersion associated with reading higher Cap-Scores, it appeared to
result from a greater Cap-Score magnitude. These data were consistent
with a high degree of statistical accuracy because Cap-Score values
were clustered tightly about the true value when the same sperm
population was randomly resampled by the same or a different reader.

Effect of calcium ionophore A23187 on Cap-Score. Sperm were incubated with basal, Non-Cap medium (n = 10), with stimuli for

Cap-Score was observed from the Non-Cap to Cap treatment. A reduction in Cap-Score was observed in the Cap + ionophore treatment,
showing that the sperm having undergone acrosome exocytosis originated from the subpopulation of cells having the GM1/CP pattern. (b)

(n = 5), with non-capacitating medium and then incubated with A23187 (Non-Cap + ionophore; n = 5), or with stimuli for capacitation (Cap)
(n = 4). No difference in Cap-Score was observed between the Non-Cap and Non-Cap + ionophore treatments, substantiating a lack of
exocytosis in unstimulated sperm. (d) The GM1 localization pattern versus the percent of cells having that pattern for each of the following

Those means with different superscripts were found to be different using Fisher’s LSD (p < 0.05)

 2.4 | Evaluation of reproducibility between readers
Ten stitched images were obtained each for the “lower Cap-Score” and
“presumedfertile”groups.Cap-Scoresweredeterminedbytwodifferent
readers whorandomly resampled eachimage20times; thisallowedusto
compare reproducibility in scoring between readers. Also, since each
image file contained several magnitudes more sperm than were being
sampled, each random resampling represented a distinct subsample of
cells from withinan individualejaculate.There was nodifferenceinmean
Cap-Score (Figure 3b) or variance (Figure 3c) between readers for any
image file. Cap-Score was therefore reproducible between readers
because independent readers obtained similar Cap-Score distributions
when resampling the same population of sperm. These data also further
established assay precision and accuracy when sampling 150 sperm, as
there was little change in Cap-Score when different subsamples of the
same population were compared between readers.
2.5 | Impact of liquefaction time
Cap-Score was compared between the control of 0.25 hr and test
samples of 1.25 (n = 10) and 2 hr (n = 9) to determine if an increase in
liquefaction time would alter the proportion of sperm capable of
responding to capacitation stimuli. When compared to the control,
Cap-Scores of samples liquefied for 1.25 or 2 hr were not different for
Non-Cap (Figure 4a; 0.25 vs. 1.25 hr p = 0.82; Figure 4b; 0.25 vs. 2 hr
p = 0.44) or Cap samples (Figure 4a; 0.25 vs. 1.25 hr p = 0.16; Figure 4b;
0.25 vs. 2 hr p = 0.47).
The percentage of motile sperm was measured immediately
following liquefaction (initial) and after washing (post-wash) for the
0.25- and 2-hr liquefaction times (Figure 4c). Motilities for the 1.25-hr
liquefaction time were only obtained after sample washing (data not
shown). Initial motilities were similar for both 0.25- and 2-hr
liquefaction treatments (p = 0.39), although a significant drop was
observed in post-wash motility for the 2-hr liquefaction treatment
(p = 0.02). Post-wash motilities were similar for both the 0.25- and
1.25-hr liquefaction treatments (p = 0.87; data not shown). Although
capacitation was not affected, motility decreased for the 2-hr
liquefaction subsequent to washing.
2.6 | Impact of mechanical liquefaction
Pilot studies revealed that passage through a hypodermic needle
negatively affected the percentage of motile sperm and membrane
integrity, so this method of viscosity reduction was not included in this
study. Cap-Score was, however, obtained for five semen samples
processed with a Pasteur pipette or a wide-orifice transfer pipette, and
then compared to samples liquefied for 0.25 hr (control) to determine
the impact of mechanical liquefaction on capacitation ability. Cap-
Scores for Pasteur pipette and wide-orifice transfer pipette were not
altered when compared to the control (Pasteur pipette, p = 0.73; wide-
orifice transfer pipette p > 0.99) (Figure 5a).
Initial, post-wash, and post-incubation motilities were obtained
for the control, Pasteur pipette, and wide-orifice-transfer-pipette
treatments; no difference was noted in post-wash (p = 0.19) or post-
incubation (p = 0.11) motilities for the wide-orifice transfer pipette
treatment when compared to initial populations (Figure 5b). In
contrast, motility decreased for samples processed with a Pasteur
pipette
when
comparing
initial
to
post-incubation
treatments
(p = 0.003) as well as post-wash to post-incubation treatments
(p = 0.004). Although mechanical liquefaction did not appear to affect
the ability to capacitate, as measured by the Cap-Score, processing
samples with a Pasteur pipette can have a negative impact on motility
subsequent to washing and extended incubation.

(Non-Cap, 0.25 hr), 27 ± 3% (Non-Cap, 1.25 hr), 41 ± 2% (Cap 0.25 hr), and 45 ± 2% (Cap, 1.25 hr). The average Cap-Scores in (b) were 19 ± 3%
(Non-Cap, 0.25 hr), 22 ± 2% (Non-Cap, 2 hr), 40 ± 3% (Cap, 0.25 hr), and 43 ± 3% (Cap, 2 hr). No difference was observed for Cap-Score between
the liquefaction times for either capacitating treatment. (c) Motilities for nine samples were obtained following 0.25 hr (solid bars) and 2 hr
(dashed bars) liquefaction times, immediately after liquefaction (initial) and after washing (post-wash). Average initial motilities for the 0.25- and
2-hr liquefaction times were 67 ± 4% and 62 ± 4%, respectively. Average post-wash motilities for the liquefactions times were 57 ± 4% (0.25 hr)
and 41 ± 4% (2 hr). The 2-hr liquefaction treatment resulted in a significant drop in post-wash motility compared to the
0.25-hr liquefaction treatment. Means ± standard errors are shown in each graph

 2.7 | Impact of enzymatic liquefaction
2.7.1 | Chymotrypsin
The impact of enzymatic liquefaction on capacitation was tested via
Cap-Score, first by using samples liquefied with chymotrypsin (which
was then removed during the washing process) or incubated for 3 hr in
the presence of chymotrypsin and then compared to samples liquefied
only for 0.25 hr (control; N = 10). Samples liquefied with chymotrypsin
and incubated under Non-Cap conditions were not affected (p = 0.66).
In contrast, samples liquefied with chymotrypsin and incubated under
Cap conditions exhibited a drop in Cap-Score when compared to the
control (p = 0.002) (Figure 6a) due to a decrease in the number of
capacitated cells combined with an increase in the number of abnormal
cells. Cap-Scores could not be obtained for samples incubated in the
presence of chymotrypsin due to high concentrations of membrane
damage and what appeared to be cell swelling consistent with volume
regulatory defects (Figure 6b).
Post-wash and post-incubation Non-Cap and Cap motilities were
calculated for all three chymotrypsin treatments. A difference was
observed for samples incubated with chymotrypsin in both the Non-Cap
and Cap treatments when comparing the average motilities of the control
tothechymotrypsinliquefactiontreatments(p = 0.001,0.004)(Figure6c).
2.7.2 | Bromelain
A pilot study was performed using the enzyme bromelain to determine
if the effect of enzymatic liquefaction with chymotrypsin on
capacitation was specific to chymotrypsin or could be induced by
other proteases used to reduce viscosity. Five samples were liquefied
for 0.25 hr with bromelain, and compared to control samples. Samples
liquefied with bromelain and incubated under Cap conditions
exhibited a drop in Cap-Score compared to the control due to a
decrease in capacitated cells and an increase in abnormal cells
(p = 0.049) (Figure 6d). Similar to our findings with chymotrypsin,
samples liquefied with bromelain and incubated under Non-Cap
conditions were not affected (p = 0.32). Cap-Scores were not obtained
for samples incubated with bromelain due to the large concentration
of damaged cells found in the incubated chymotrypsin treatment.

| DISCUSSION
The results presented here validate the accuracy, repeatability, and
precision of the Cap-Score Sperm Function Test; they also provide
important information on the influence of semen handling/prepara-
tion methods on assay outcomes. This report does not provide the
routine protocols for validation of the laboratory methodology to
perform the assay, which is beyond the scope of this work.
We investigated if the assay accurately identified sperm that
responded to stimuli for capacitation from those that either were
not exposed, or did not respond. We used two different approaches
to establish that the GM1/CP pattern did in fact identify capacitated
sperm: (i) dual-labeling experiments with PNA supported the notion
that sperm with the GM1/CP pattern also demonstrated communi-
cation
between
the
plasma
membrane
and
outer
acrosomal
membrane. This observation is consistent with the current working
model of plasma membrane dynamics during capacitation, in which
point-fusions occur between the plasma membrane and underlying
outer acrosomal membrane, exposing acrosomal matrix contents

The use of Pasteur pipettes and wide-orifice transfer pipettes for mechanical liquefaction. Ejaculates of five individuals were split
into three portions: mechanical liquefaction (control; black bar); 1:1 dilution with mHTF medium and mechanical liquefaction with Pasteur
pipettes (PP; dark gray bar); and 1:1 dilution with mHTF medium and mechanical liquefaction with wide orifice transfer pipettes (WOTP; light
gray bar). All three portions were incubated under Cap conditions, and then processed for Cap-Score. (a) Cap-Score following each

those liquefied with WOTP. In contrast, a drop in motility for the Pasteur pipette post-incubation treatment was observed when compared
both to the initial and post-wash treatments. Means ± standard errors are shown in each graph

 and thus the ligand for PNA. (ii) A portion of the sperm with the
GM1/CP pattern completed acrosome exocytosis in response to
calcium ionophore, more definitively linking Cap-Score and capaci-
tation at the level of individual gametes. Because the GM1/CP
pattern is localized over the rostral sperm head, we hypothesized
that acrosome exocytosis would result in loss of the membranes
contributing to that pattern, and hence either no labeling with CTB
or the appearance of cells having an “other” pattern that is
consistent with membrane perturbation; both outcomes would
lower the Cap-Score, which was observed.
Next, we showed that the precision of this assay was only
modestly improved by counting more than 100 sperm, which provides
a threshold to ensure that the number of sperm evaluated for each
assay was representative of the ejaculate’s distribution. Despite the
relatively low number required, we chose to score the GM1 localization
pattern of at least 150 sperm to be conservative.
The consistency of assay readout among different andrologists
was addressed by training two individuals to read GM1 patterns,
and then assessing the distribution of their Cap-Score readings.
Twenty large-image files that contained up to 5,000 sperm each
were created and resampled 20 times by each reader. An average
standard deviation and average coefficient of variation revealed
that the assay variance and/or dispersion were small and stable,
which is indicative of a high degree of Cap-Score reproducibility
per reader. Comparison of the scoring between the two readers
showed an average difference of 1 in mean Cap-Score. When the
Bonferroni correction was applied, no discernable differences
were observed. Similarly, Cap-Score variances were not different
FIGURE 6
Use of chymotrypsin or bromelain for liquefaction negatively affected Cap-Score. (a) Ten ejaculates were split into three portions.
The first portion was liquefied for 0.25 hr (control; black bars), the second portion was liquefied with 5 mg chymotrypsin per ejaculate for
0.25 hr (dark gray bars), and the third portion was incubated with 3 mg/ml chymotrypsin for 3 hr (light gray bars). A significant drop in Cap-
Score for Cap samples was observed between chymotrypsin conditions compared to control. Non-Cap and Cap samples incubated with
chymotrypsin could not be scored due to high levels of membrane damage. (b) Samples incubated under control conditions and labeled for
localization of GM1 appear normal (top left). However, samples incubated with chymotrypsin had high concentrations of sperm lacking
recognizable GM1 localization patterns and exhibiting membrane damage (bottom left). Many of the sperm had enlarged cytoplasmic droplets
(arrows), which are consistent with defects in volume regulation. A wider field of view demonstrates the abundance of cells having enlarged
cytoplasmic droplets (arrows; image on right). The samples from (a) were further analyzed in (c). Post-wash and post-incubation motilities
were obtained for Non-Cap and Cap samples liquefied for 0.25 hr (control; black bars), samples liquefied with chymotrypsin for 0.25 hr (dark
gray bars), and samples incubated with chymotrypsin for 3 hr (light gray bars). A significant increase in the percentage of motile sperm for
samples incubated with chymotrypsin was observed compared to the control in the post-incubation Non-Cap and Cap treatments. (d) Five
other ejaculates were split into two portions, and the first portion was liquefied for 0.25 hr (control; black bars) while the second portion was
liquefied for 0.25 hr with bromelain (dark gray bars). All portions were washed and incubated for 3 hr at 37°C in either Non-Cap or Cap
conditions, and processed for Cap-Score. A significant drop in Cap-Score was observed for Cap samples with bromelain compared to control.

 between readers. Collectively, these comparisons demonstrate
that the Cap-Score is highly reproducible and reliable within and
between trained readers, which are key considerations when
attempting to evaluate male reproductive fitness.
Another source of variance that could affect assay reliability lies
in semen handling/preparation and processing techniques. We
focused on three main liquefaction approaches, as sperm are
sensitive to this step of handling and there is significant variation
among andrologists in liquefaction methods. The time allowed for
liquefaction in assisted reproduction clinics typically ranges from
0.25 to 1 hr, at 37°C in air or CO2 incubators. In the present study,
liquefaction durations of up to 2 hr did not change Cap-Score,
whereas motility was reduced in post-wash samples liquefied for
2 hr. This effect might be a consequence of extended sperm
exposure to proteins found in seminal plasma that inhibit motility,
such as semenogelin I (Lilja, Abrahamsson, & Lundwall, 1989; Robert
& Gagnon, 1999) or its binding partner EPPIN (Silva, Hamil, &
O’Rand, 2013). Prolonged exposure to motility-inhibiting proteins
might also affect the ability to separate such inhibitory proteins from
sperm by washing.
Mechanical liquefaction with glass Pasteur pipettes or plastic
wide-orifice transfer pipettes did not affect capacitation, although use
of Pasteur pipettes did result in a decline in post-wash motility. This
effect could be a result of differences in expulsion properties between
glass and plastic (e.g., stickiness) or in orifice diameter, which
influences physical stress (e.g., shear forces). Physical stressors, such
as centrifugation and repeated pipetting, were reported to damage
rodent and human sperm and to interfere with their motility (Alvarez
et al., 1993; Katkov & Mazur, 1998; Varisli, Uguz, Agca, & Agca, 2009).
Interestingly, some physical stressors lead to sublethal damage in
human sperm that is only observed during extended incubations
(Alvarez et al., 1993). Thus it is possible that damage induced by
Pasteur pipettes rendered these sperm less able to withstand sample
washing or to survive the subsequent incubation. Nonetheless, our
data support the view that the functional impacts were minimal, as
even after extended incubations there was no impact of mechanical
liquefaction with either Pasteur or plastic wide orifice transfer pipettes
on capacitation ability.
Whereas liquefaction timing and mechanical liquefaction had
little impact on Cap-Score, enzymatic liquefaction with chymotryp-
sin or bromelain reduced the Cap-Score in samples stimulated for
capacitation. If the impairment resulted from changes in membrane
curvature or surface lipid presentation that altered GM1 labeling, a
similar reduction in Cap-Score should have been observed in the
Non-Cap treatment group; however, this was not the case. Thus,
proteolytic enzymes might inhibit capacitation or mechanisms
associated
with
capacitation,
and
the
mechanism(s)
warrant
additional investigation. Potential targets for the enzymes include
any of the numerous plasma membrane proteins, particularly ion
channels that are needed for volume regulation or capacitation.
Chymotrypsin and bromelain might also damage proteins found in
the seminal plasma that positively regulate capacitation in a manner
similar to the heparin-binding proteins found in cattle (Miller,
Winer, & Ax, 1990).
Although not a common or recommended practice, incubation for
3 hr with chymotrypsin provided further evidence that these enzymes
negatively affected proteins within the sperm membrane. Sperm
incubated under both Non-Cap and Cap conditions exhibited
significant damage, which was consistent with inability to regulate
volume and prevented CTB labeling for determination of GM1
localization patterns. This extended exposure time experiment was
intended not only to simulate samples containing residual chymotryp-
sin following washing (or exposure to very high concentrations for
shorter time periods), but also to exaggerate the presence and to
suggest the potential nature of damage done to the sperm during a
typical 0.25 hr liquefaction with chymotrypsin. Volume is regulated in
sperm cells by potassium and chloride ion channels involved in cyclic
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-mediated protein tyrosine phos-
phorylation pathways (Petrunkina, Harrison, Tsolova, Jebe, & Topfer-
Petersen, 2007; Petrunkina, Jebe, & Topfer-Petersen, 2005; Yeung,
Barfield, Anapolski, & Cooper, 2004). Water channels have also been
detected on the cytoplasmic droplet in mouse (Yeung, Callies, Rojek,
Nielsen, & Cooper, 2009) and rat sperm (Yeung & Cooper, 2010), and
in the midpiece membranes in human sperm (Yeung, Callies,
Tuttelmann, Kliesch, & Cooper, 2010). The swollen appearance of
the cells suggests that exposing sperm to chymotrypsin or bromelain
can damage these membrane channels, leading to the dysregulation of
volume and capacitation in samples exposed to capacitating stimuli.
Despite the effects on cell volume and membrane architecture, the
percentageof motile sperm increased in both Non-Cap and Cap samples
incubated with chymotrypsin, when compared to control populations
without the protease. The increase in motility might have resulted from
altered intracellular concentration of ions, such as calcium or bicarbon-
ate, that regulate sperm motility (Fakih, MacLusky, DeCherney, Wall-
imann, & Huszar, 1986; Turner, 2006). Alternatively, treatment with
chymotrypsin might have damaged motility-inhibitory substances, such
as protein kinase A (PKA)-anchoring inhibitor peptides (Vijayaraghavan,
Goueli, Davey, & Carr, 1997), or might have digested semenogelin I (Lilja
et al., 1989; Robert & Gagnon, 1999) or its binding partner EPPIN (Silva
etal.,2013).Targetedresearch beyondthe scope of thisreport would be
needed to identify chymotrypsin’s specific effects on membrane
channels, cAMP activity, and/or tyrosine phosphorylation.
Assessment of male fertility is plagued by the inability to assess
sperm function—namely, the ability of a individual’s sperm to fertilize an
egg (Oehninger et al., 2014; Wang & Swerdloff, 2014). A simple
diagnostic assay would provide a needed functional complement to the
descriptive assessments of traditional semen evaluations (World Health
Organization, 2010). Identifying sperm with deficiencies in fertilizing
ability will allow for a more specific understanding of what is now
categorized as “idiopathic infertility.” Of much greater practical
importance, such a physiological assessment would enable a clinician
to effectively counsel a couple toward the most appropriate form of
assisted reproduction to achieve pregnancy. To meet this pressing
clinical need, many assays of sperm function have been suggested–e.g.,
hamster zona pellucida-penetration assays (Barros, Gonzalez, Herrera,
& Bustos-Obregon, 1979; Rogers et al., 1979), sperm-zona pellucida-
binding tests (Liu, Garrett, & Baker, 2004), and cervical mucus
penetration assays (Alexander, 1981; Eggert-Kruse, Leinhos, Gerhard,
MOODY ET AL.
| 417
 Tilgen, & Runnebaum, 1989; Menge & Beitner, 1989)—but their use in
the clinic is limited by the difficulty in obtaining needed materials in a
logisticallypracticalfashion. Fillingthe currentvoid,datapresentedhere
validate the Cap-Score as an assay that can determine the ability of
sperm to undergo the physiological changes required to fertilize an egg.
Complementing these findings,the clinical utility of the Cap-Scoreassay
was also tested in an independent, post-hoc clinical trial, in which it was
found that capacitation status strongly tracked with a man’s history of
fertility (Cardona et al., 2017).
Even when standardized according to the recommendations of
national or international organizations, the methods traditionally
used for semen analysis remain subjective and variable (Auger et al.,
2000; Jørgensen et al., 2001). Therefore, it has been recommended
that internal and external quality controls be developed and the
variations observed within and between persons performing semen
analysis be evaluated to reduce confounding the assessment of
semen quality (Cooper, Neuwinger, Bahrs, & Nieschlag, 1992;
Matson, 1995; Mortimer, Shu, & Tan, 1986; Neuwinger, Behre, &
Nieschlag, 1990). In contrast, the data presented in the current study
demonstrate that the Cap-Score is highly reproducible and reliable
within and between readers. The data and image files acquired could
serve as a foundation for the continued quality control and quality
assurance in the evaluation of Cap-Score. For example, 2 of the 20
image files, one each from the “lower Cap-Scores” and “presumed
fertile” groups could be selected at random and scored each day to
demonstrate a reader’s daily ability to read Cap-Scores. If values are
obtained that are outside of acceptable ranges from the established
mean (Westgard, Barry, Hunt, & Groth, 1981), the laboratory
director can be consulted for remediation. These data can also be
used to track individual readers over time and to identify potential
changes in Cap-Score determination. Similarly, as new personal are
trained and incorporated into the reading rotation, their reading
ability can be evaluated by scoring multiple image files and
comparing their Cap-Scores to established values. Only through
continued internal and external quality assurance and quality control
will high standards of evaluating sperm function be maintained.

| MATERIALS AND METHODS
4.1 | Specimen collection
All
procedures
were
approved
by
the
Western
Institutional
Review Board (https://www.wirb.com/Pages/Default.aspx; Protocol
#20152233). Semen samples were collected by manual masturbation
from consenting men with known fertility (evidence of fathering a child
within the past 3 years or current pregnancy), after a minimum of 2 and
a maximum of 5 days of sexual abstinence. Any samples having fewer
than 10 × 106 motile sperm were discarded from this study.
4.2 | Standard sample processing
Ejaculates within a sealed specimen container (Fisher Scientific,
14-375-462) were liquefied at 37°C in an air incubator, and then
removed from the seminal plasma by centrifugation through
Enhance S-Plus Cell Isolation Media (Vitrolife, reference: 15232
ESP-100-90%) at 300g for 10 min. The cells were collected,
resuspended in ∼4 ml of Modified Human Tubal Fluid medium
(mHTF) (Irvine Scientific; reference 90126 [97.8 mM NaCl; 4.69 mM
KCl; 0.20 mM MgSO4; 0.37 mM KH2PO4; 2.04 mM CaCl2; 4 mM
NaHCO3; 21 mM HEPES; 2.78 mM C6H12O6; 0.33 mM sodium
pyruvate; 21.4 mM sodium lactate; 10 μg/ml gentamicin; 5 mg/L
phenol red]), and pelleted at 600g for 10 min. This washing protocol
was optimized through extensive preliminary studies (data not
shown) to remove seminal plasma, which can interfere with
assessment of GM1 localization. The sperm were resuspended in
mHTF with (Cap) and without (Non-Cap) a stimulus for capacitation,
and incubated for 3 hr at 37°C. The capacitation stimulus consisted
of
2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin
(Sigma;
reference
C0926)
(Osheroff et al., 1999; Parinaud, Vieitez, Vieu, Collet, & Perret,
2000). Pilot studies showed that this stimulus was as effective in
promoting capacitation in human sperm, as measured by GM1
localization patterns, at 3 hr of incubation as albumin was at 6 hr
(Vairo et al., 2013). Following incubation, all samples were fixed with
paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences; Hatfield, PA), as
previously described (Selvaraj et al., 2006). The fixed samples were
maintained at room temperature overnight prior to labeling.
4.3 | Cap-Score and acrosome exocytosis
Two treatments were prepared for each of 10 semen samples. Cap and
Non-Cap treatments were incubated, respectively, with and without
2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin for 3 hr. For seven of these samples, a
third treatment, Cap + ionophore, was prepared in which sperm were
incubated with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin for 2.75 hr, then the
calcium ionophore A23187 (Sigma–Aldrich, Allentown, PA; reference
C7522) was added to a final concentration of 20 μM and the cells were
incubated for another 0.25 hr.
In a second set of experiments, Cap (n = 4) and Non-Cap (n = 5)
treatments
were
incubated,
respectively,
with
and
without
2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin for 3 hr, plus a third treatment of
Non-Cap + ionophore was prepared. For this treatment, sperm were
incubated in basal non-capacitating media for 2.75 hr, then the calcium
ionophore A23187 (Sigma–Aldrich) was added to a final concentration
of 20 μM and the cells were incubated for another 0.25 hr.
Following incubation, the sperm were attached to slides for
0.25 hr,
labeled
for
10 min
with
10 μg/ml
of
Alexa
Fluor®
647-conjugated PNA from Arachis hypogaea (Thermo Fisher, Allen-
town, PA; reference L32460), washed 1× with mHTF, fixed for 0.5 hr,
and then labeled with 2 μg/ml of Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated CTB
(Thermo Fisher, reference C34775). All labeling and slide work was
done in a humidified chamber maintained at 37°C.
4.4 | Calculating sperm motility
The percentage of motile sperm was evaluated by counting
non-motile and motile sperm in 10 squares on a Makler chamber
(Sefi-Medical Instruments; Haifa, Israel), and then the number of
418 |

 motile sperm was divided by the total number of sperm counted.
Motility was determined four separate times for each treatment.
This was achieved by having two unique samples of the treatment
assessed by two different readers. The average of the four motility
readings was recorded after liquefaction (initial), after standard
processing
(post-wash),
and
after
the
3-hr
incubation
(post-
incubation).
4.5 | Varying time of liquefaction
Ejaculates of 10 fertile individuals were split into two portions. The
first portion was liquefied for 0.25 hr while the second portion was
liquefied for 1.25 hr in a sealed 15-ml polypropylene conical tube
(FALCON; reference 352096) placed in a 37°C water bath. In later
experiments, nine ejaculates were liquefied for 0.25 and 2 hr. All
tests of liquefaction duration were performed at 37°C.
4.6 | Mechanical liquefaction
Five samples from four fertile men were split into three portions.
The first portion was liquefied for 0.25 hr (standard processing
control). The second portion was liquefied for 0.25 hr then diluted
with pre-warmed mHTF (1:1 dilution). After the addition of mHTF,
the sample was gently pulled into and expelled 10 times from a non-
sterile
Pasteur
pipette
(VWR;
reference
14672-380).
The
third portion was liquefied for 0.25 hr, diluted with an equal
volume of mHTF, and then gently pulled into and expelled 10 times
from a non-sterile wide orifice transfer pipette (VWR; reference
14670-147).
4.7 | Liquefaction with chymotrypsin
Samples from five fertile men were split into three portions. The first
portion
was
liquefied
following
standard
processing methods
(control); the second portion was liquefied with chymotrypsin
(VitroLife;
reference
15524)
according
to
the
manufacturer’s
direction, using a fixed 5 mg/ejaculate for 0.25 hr; and the third
portion was liquefied following standard processing methods, but
was incubated for 3 hr in the presence of 3 mg/ml chymotrypsin.
4.8 | Liquefaction with bromelain
Samples from five fertile men were split into two portions. The first
portion was liquefied for 0.25 hr at 37°C; and the second portion was
liquefied
with
bromelain
(Sigma;
reference B5144-100UN),
as
recommended by the World Health Organization (2010), for 0.25 hr
at 37°C (10 units/ml). Both portions were then processed following
standard operating procedures.
4.9 | Sample labeling
Following incubation and fixation, liquefied samples were labeled
with 2 μg/ml of Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated CTB. After 10 min, 5 μl
of the labeled sperm was placed on a microscope slide, overlaid with
a cover slip, and moved to an imaging station.
4.10 | Image acquisition
Imaging
was
performed
on
Nikon
Eclipse
NI-E
microscopes
equipped with CFI60 Plan Apochromat Lambda 40× Objectives;
C-FL AT GFP/FITC Long-Pass Filter Sets; Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash
4.0 cameras; H101F—ProScan III Open Frame Upright Motorized
H101F Flat Top Microscope Stages; and 64-bit imaging workstations
running NIS Elements software (Nikon; Melville, NY). For the
reliability studies, these systems were programmed to automatically
capture sets of 15 × 15 stitched images containing up to 5,000
sperm. For the acrosome-exocytosis studies, the C-FL AT GFP/FITC
Long-Pass Filter Set was modified to have a band-pass emission
filter (ET535/50M). A C-FL At Cy5/Fluor 647/Draq5 Filter set in
combination with a ND16 filter were employed to visualize the Alexa
Fluor 647.
4.11 | Cap-Score determination
Two independent readers were trained to identify GM1 localization
patterns associated with capacitation of human sperm. The proportion
of sperm within a sample having undergone capacitation was
determined and reported as the Cap-Score (# of sperm with
capacitation patterns/(# of sperm with capacitation patterns + number
of sperm with other patterns)). For additional tests, readers were
trained to identify GM1 localization patterns and were required to
determine the Cap-Score for 10 of the stitched images. New readers
had to be within 2 standard deviations of the mean Cap-Score
established by the original two readers to qualify for scoring.
4.12 | Statistical analyses
Power Analysis was done using G*power (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &
Buchner, 2007). The following four quantities have an intimate
relationship:
(i)
sample
size;
(ii)
effect
size;
(iii)
significance
level = probability (Type I error) = incorrect rejection of a true null
hypothesis (a “false positive”); and (iv) power = 1 − probability (Type II
error) = incorrectly retaining a false null hypothesis (“false negative”).
Given any three, the fourth can be determined. For the purposes of
this study, power analysis was used to estimate the number of images
to sample for evaluating Cap-Score accuracy.
Student’s t-test was performed using Microsoft Excel (2013), and
was used to compare Cap-Score means between two readers. In this
example 20 different means were compared, increasing the chance of
incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis that there is no difference
between the means (i.e., making a Type I error). A Bonferroni
correction was applied to counteract this problem. Similarly, Student’s
t-test was used to compare the Cap-Scores for liquefaction timing,
mechanical liquefaction, and enzymatic liquefaction using the online
statistical calculator in silico (t-test; available online at: http://in-silico.
net/tools/statistics/ttest).
Fisher’s LSD was used for comparing means in the acrosome-

data,
