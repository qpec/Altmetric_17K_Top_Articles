Abstract 
Background We are faced with a growing crisis of non-communicable diseases driven by factors such 
as unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, tobacco use, and alcohol consumption, compounded by major 
inequalities in health. Over recent decades, biomedical research methods have helped to answer 
many important questions about treatment and prevention, but the kinds of tools that can tell us 
which intervention to choose over another are not invariably the most appropriate to address 
complex challenges such as designing healthier cities, or creating healthier, more sustainable food 
systems. The aim of this project was to identify the main obstacles to obtaining valid and 
appropriate evidence to guide public health decision making, and propose a set of solutions to 
address these problems.  
 
Methods We conducted a series of case studies to illustrate some of the problems with the current 
dominance of the biomedical approach to the generation and use of evidence for complex public 
health problems, including an analysis of the types of projects funded by the National Institute for 
Health (NIHR) Public Health Research (PHR) Programme since 2009. We held a workshop on Sept 
12–13, 2016, for several internationally recognised experts on complex systems approaches to 
public health evidence to produce a consensus statement. 
 
Findings The NIHR case study showed that funding from the PHR Programme has predominantly 
gone to the evaluation of downstream, individual-level interventions, with only a small proportion 
devoted to assessment of upstream policy actions (>75% of the 110 funded proposals examined 
downstream or midstream interventions). The key conclusions from the meeting are that current 
approaches to research and policy in major public health problems such as obesity have reached an 
impasse. Breaking this impasse will require a move beyond linear models of cause and effect to 
embrace complex systems approaches to both the generation and use of evidence. Achieving a 
solution will require many changes, ranging from strategic shifts in the way research is funded to 
new conceptual models for tackling public health problems at system level. 
 
Interpretation There is a pressing need to change the focus of research and action to tackle complex 
public health problems. Research funding must address the challenges of evaluating not only 
complex interventions, but also simple interventions within complex systems. The tools required to 
do this are still in the early stages of development, but we need to rebalance our approach to public 
health research to encompass complex systems science and methods in addition to more traditional 
 biomedical approaches. The expert group will publish its views in a consensus paper towards the 
end of 2016.
