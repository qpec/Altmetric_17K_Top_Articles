Abstract
Objective: ATL1103 is a second-generation antisense oligomer targeting the human growth hormone (GH) receptor. This 
phase 2 randomised, open-label, parallel-group study assessed the potential of ATL1103 as a treatment for acromegaly.
Design: Twenty-six patients with active acromegaly (IGF-I >130% upper limit of normal) were randomised to subcutaneous 
ATL1103 200 
mg either once or twice weekly for 13 weeks and monitored for a further 8-week washout period.
Methods: The primary efficacy measures were change in IGF-I at week 14, compared to baseline and between cohorts. 
For secondary endpoints (IGFBP3, acid labile subunit (ALS), GH, growth hormone-binding protein (GHBP)), comparison 
was between baseline and week 14. Safety was assessed by reported adverse events.
Results and conclusions: Baseline median IGF-I was 447 and 649 ng/mL in the once- and twice-weekly groups 
respectively. Compared to baseline, at week 14, twice-weekly ATL1103 resulted in a median fall in IGF-I of 27.8% 
(P = 0.0002). Between cohort comparison at week 14 demonstrated the median fall in IGF-I to be 25.8% (P = 0.0012) 
greater with twice-weekly dosing. In the twice-weekly cohort, IGF-I was still declining at week 14, and remained 
lower at week 21 than at baseline by a median of 18.7% (P = 0.0005). Compared to baseline, by week 14, IGFBP3 and 
ALS had declined by a median of 8.9% (P = 0.027) and 16.7% (P = 0.017) with twice-weekly ATL1103; GH had increased 
by a median of 46% at week 14 (P = 0.001). IGFBP3, ALS and GH did not change with weekly ATL1103. GHBP fell by a 
median of 23.6% and 48.8% in the once- and twice-weekly cohorts (P = 0.027 and P = 0.005) respectively. ATL1103 was 
well tolerated, although 84.6% of patients experienced mild-to-moderate injection-site reactions. This study provides 
proof of concept that ATL1103 is able to significantly lower IGF-I in patients with acromegaly.

Antisense oligomer treatment 
for acromegaly
www.eje-online.org
Introduction
Acromegaly is a rare, chronic, life-shortening disease 
caused by hypersecretion of growth hormone (GH), 
virtually always due to a pituitary adenoma, that in turn 
results in elevated circulating levels of insulin-like growth 
factor 1 (IGF-I) (1). Conventional therapy is directed at 
the pituitary gland and attempts to reduce GH secretion 
by means of surgery, radiotherapy or medical therapy 
in the form of somatostatin analogues and dopamine 
agonists (2). The GH receptor antagonist pegvisomant has 
successfully exploited an alternative therapeutic approach, 
namely to block GH action rather than secretion (3).
Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are single-stranded 
synthetic oligonucleotides that have been developed as 
therapeutic agents. Translation of mRNA, and hence, protein 
synthesis, is inhibited by sequence-specific ASOs that bind 
target pre-mRNA and/or mRNA (4). In the early 1990s, 
clinical trials with ASOs began, and in 1998, fomivirsen 
became the first oligonucleotide to be approved by the US 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of 
cytomegalovirus retinitis (5). In 2013, the second-generation 
ASO inhibitor mipomersen was approved by the FDA for the 
treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. 
Currently, there are more than 30 second-generation ASOs, 
including ATL1103, in clinical development for a variety 
of neurological, oncological, cardiovascular and metabolic 
conditions. Excellent reviews of the technology are available 
elsewhere (6).
ATL1103 is a second-generation, antisense oligomer 
designed to inhibit translation of human growth 
hormone receptor (GHR) mRNA (Fig. 1). It comprises 
20 nucleotides with a phosphorothioate backbone and 
2′-O-methoxyethyl modifications of the terminal five 
nucleotides at each end, which in combination increase 
its plasma half-life and affinity for the mRNA. Post-
hybridisation RNase H degradation results in inhibition 
of GHR translation. In pre-clinical rodent and primate 
studies, ATL1103 reduced GHR mRNA levels in the liver 
and serum IGF-I, with a terminal half-life of 2–4 weeks (7). 
Phase 1 studies in healthy male volunteers demonstrated a 
fall in serum IGF-I and growth hormone–binding protein 
(GHBP) (https://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20111207/pdf/ 
4234016x2cj5xn.pdf).
The objectives of this study were to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability and efficacy of ATL1103 in patients 
with acromegaly. Serum IGF-I was the primary measure 
of efficacy, with the other components of the IGF ternary 
complex, namely IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) and 
acid labile subunit (ALS) being additional measures of 
disease activity. Circulating GH and GHBP, the cleaved 
extracellular component of the GHR, were monitored to 
provide insight into the physiological implications of an 
ASO targeting the GHR. For the primary efficacy variable, 
the null hypothesis of no percentage change in fasting 
IGF-I levels from baseline to week 14 was tested for each 
treatment regimen.
Subjects and methods
Study design
This was a phase 2 randomised, open-label, parallel-group 
study of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and 
efficacy of two subcutaneous dosing regimens of ATL1103 
in patients with acromegaly (Fig. 2).

safety or affected results from this study,
11. had a history of alcohol or drug abuse in the 6-month 
period preceding the baseline visit.
Patients were recruited in 13 tertiary referral centres in 
Australia, France, Spain and the United Kingdom.
The study was approved by the NRES Committee East 
Midlands, Derby, UK; Bicêtre Hospital, France; Ethical 
Committee of Clinical Research, Hospital del al Santa 
Crue I Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain and Royal Adelaide 
Human Research Ethics Committee, Adelaide, Australia. 
The study was registered as EudraCT 201200314730 
and ANZCTR 12611000854932. Patients gave written 
informed consent.
Procedures and study medication
Patients received either ATL1103 200 
mg once or twice 
weekly 3 and 4 days apart for 13 weeks, with every patient 
receiving three doses in the first week, administered 
every other day. Based on the tissue half-life of >4 weeks, 
experience from primate studies and data from the 
 
phase 1 study, additional ‘loading’ doses were administered 
in the first week.
ATL1103 is formulated as a ‘ready-to-inject’ sterile 
solution at a concentration of 200 
mg/mL, pH 7.4, 
in ‘Water for Injection’. Patients were taught to self-
administer ATL1103 subcutaneously. After completion of 
drug administration at the end of 13 weeks, patients were 
monitored, off all therapy for acromegaly, for a further 
8 weeks.
All patients underwent pituitary MRI scans at 
baseline and at week 13 (completion of the study drug), 
which were independently reviewed by two ‘blinded’ 
expert pituitary neurosurgeons. Tumour diameter 
changes of 2 mm or more in any one dimension or 
tumour volume changes of more than 20% were 
considered significant.
An OGTT with measurement of plasma glucose and 
serum GH was undertaken at baseline (after any drug 
washout) and again at the end of week 13. An adverse 
event (AE) assessment was undertaken at each of the 11 
study visits from baseline until study conclusion.
In addition to routine safety parameters, serum IGF-I, 
IGFBP3, ALS and GHBP were monitored. Ring size (fourth 
digit left hand) was measured using standard European-
sized jewellers’ ring sets, and patients completed a 
signs and symptoms score (SSS, maximum score 40) 
and the disease-generated ‘quality of life’ AcroQol. 
AcroQol comprises 22 questions divided into two 
main categories: physical and psychological function. 
The psychological category is further subdivided into 
appearance and personal relationships. Each question is 
scored out of 5, with a maximum score of 110 reflecting 
best possible quality of life. The result is then converted 
to a percentage (8).
Randomisation and blinding
Permuted block randomisation (generated by a statistician 
and imported into the electronic case report form) was 
used to assign patients to either open-label, once- or 
twice-weekly ATL1003. Once initial data for a patient had 
been entered and the patient had fulfilled all inclusion 
criteria, a randomisation number and treatment regimen 
were generated. Treatment allocation was not known to 
the operational personnel until this randomisation was 
performed.
Blocks of size four were used with no stratification for 
the first 24 patients. The list included an additional 24 
randomisation numbers using a block size of 2 (total 48) 
to allow for overage.
Assays
IGF-I, GH and IGFBP3
Serum IGF-I, GH and IGFBP3 were measured centrally 
by IDS-iSYS (Immunodiagnostic Systems, (IDS) Ltd., 
Boldon, England, UK) assays at the Endocrine Laboratory, 
Universität München (Munich, Germany). Recombinant 
standards (98/574 for GH and 02/254 for IGF-I) 
yielded interassay variability of 4.0–8.7% (IGF-I) and 
 
1.1–3.4% (GH) and sensitivity of 8.8 
ng/mL (IGF-I) and 
 
0.04 
ng/mL (GH) (9, 10). The limit of quantification 
for IGFBP3 was 50 
ng/mL and the intra- and interassay 
coefficients of variation (CVs) were 4.2% and 6.9% 
respectively (11).
ALS
Serum ALS levels were measured in duplicate by sandwich 
immunometric assay using monoclonal antibodies 
directed against specific N- and C-terminal oligopeptides 
(12). A serum pool of healthy male volunteers was used 
for calibration and assigned 1000 
U/L. The assay range is 
500–5000 
U/L, and the intra- and inter-assay CVs were 
less than 9%. All samples from an individual subject were 
analysed in one run.

GHBP
Serum GHBP levels were measured by a modification of 
the ligand immunofunctional assay with an in-house 
monoclonal anti-GHBP antibody. Within-assay CVs were 
9.4% at 115 
pmol/L and 6.1% at 1550 
pmol/L. At the 
same concentrations, between-assay CVs were 8.5% and 
10.9% respectively. The lower limit of quantification was 
69 
pmol/L, and the linear range was 69–3500 
pmol/L. All 
samples from an individual subject were analysed in one 
run (13).
Statistical analysis
The study was powered for within-group comparison of 
serum IGF-I (primary efficacy variable).
Based on a published pegvisomant study (3), a 
clinically meaningful reduction in baseline IGF-I was 
determined to be 27.5%, with a conservative estimate 
of s.d. of 30%. To achieve a level of significance of 0.05 
with a two-sided test, it was determined that a minimum 
sample size of 12 patients per treatment was required to 
achieve a power of at least 80%.
The planned efficacy analyses were within the 
intention-to-treat group. For the primary efficacy 
variable, the null hypothesis of no percentage change in 
fasting IGF-I levels from baseline to week 14 was tested 
for each treatment group with a (two-sided) one-sample 
t test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. In addition, a pre-
specified, though not powered for between-treatment 
groups, comparison was performed using a Wilcoxon 
rank-sum test (mathematically equivalent to Mann–
Whitney U test) for serum IGF-I 1 week after the last dose 
of study drug (week 14).
Baseline to week 14 testing for both cohorts was 
undertaken (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) for each of the 
secondary endpoints (the other components of the IGF 
ternary complex, namely IGFBP3 and ALS, plus circulating 
GH and GHBP, SSS, ring size and AcroQoL) and presented 
as median plus range.
A post hoc regression analysis of the relationship 
between change in IGF-I and dose/kg/week is reported 
with the associated 95% CI. Comparison of trapezoidal 
area under the curve for GH during the OGTTs is 
reported. Statistical significance is indicated by a P 
value <0.05.
Serum IGF-I data are expressed in mass units (ng/mL) 
and as a percentage of the upper limit of the age-related 
reference range.
Data Safety Monitoring Board
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
was established prior to recruitment start, with an 
appropriate charter to direct decisions and monitor the 
trial safety results at intervals throughout the study 
and provided their recommendations as to whether the 
trial could continue as planned or whether there were 
any concerns. The DSMB comprised four individuals 
with appropriate experience in the areas of acromegaly, 
endocrine disorders, statistics and the conduct of clinical 
trials.

at a dose of 200 
mg twice weekly resulted in a median fall 
in serum IGF-I of 27.8% (range 4.4–49.8%, P 
= 
0.0002), 
while no change was seen with once-weekly dosing. 
At week 14, the median fall in IGF-I was 25.8% greater 
with twice-weekly compared to once-weekly dosing 
(P 
= 
0.0012). In the twice-weekly cohort, IGF-I levels were 
still declining at week 14, and at the end of the washout 
(week 21) remained lower than at baseline by a median of 
18.7% (P 
= 
0.0005) (Figs 4 and 5).
In both dosing regimens, one patient had an IGF-I 
within the age-related reference range at the pre-defined 
endpoint of week 14. Normalisation of IGF-I at any time 
point was a pre-defined outcome measure and was met 
by one additional patient in the twice-weekly regimen 
(week 13).
Combining the data from the two dosing regimens, 
regression analysis of the percentage change in IGF-I 
levels vs dose/kg/week (median 2.88 (range 1.52–6.90)) 
demonstrated an estimated slope of regression of −8.27, 
indicative of a highly statistically significant (P 
= 
0.0001) 
association between fall in IGF-I and the dose/kg/week 
(Fig. 6).
IGFBP3
In the twice-weekly cohort, at week 14, there was a 
median fall in serum IGFBP3 of 8.9% (range −29.2 to 
12.9%, P 
= 
0.027) from baseline (median: 7005 
ng/mL, 
range: 3396–9843). Once-weekly ATL1103 did not result 
in a significant change in serum IGBP3.
ALS
Compared to baseline, twice-weekly ATL1103 resulted in 
a median fall in ALS at week 14 of 16.7% (range −20.9 
to 34.9%, P 
= 
0.017) from baseline (median: 1970 
mU/mL, 
range: 945–2463). Once-weekly ATL1103 did not result in 
a significant change in serum ALS.

GH
In the twice-weekly cohort, median trapezoidal AUC for 
GH during the OGTT had increased by 46% (range −5.4 
to 419%, P 
= 
0.001) at week 14 compared to baseline 
(471 
ng·min/mL (79–867)). There was no change in GH 
levels in the once-weekly cohort (Fig. 7).
GHBP
There was a significant decline in serum GHBP levels in 
both cohorts at week 14. Twice-weekly ATL1103 resulted in 
a median decline of 48.8% (range −9.8 to 94.1%, P 
= 
0.005) 
in GHBP from baseline (525 pmol/L (<69–6434), while a 
median fall of 23.6% (range −61.4 to 59.4%, P 
= 
0.027) was 
seen in the once-weekly cohort (1179 
pmol/L (386–7637), 
P 
= 
0.027) and was maintained through to week 21. In 
the twice-weekly cohort, the median fall in serum GHBP 
at week 21 was 40.4% (range −94.1 to 6.1%, P 
= 
0.008) 
compared to baseline (Fig. 8).
Ring size
There was a statistically significant decrease in ring 
size circumference (mm) from baseline to week 13 for 
 
regimen 2, with a median decrease of −1.25 
mm (range 
−12.6 to 3.8, P 
= 
0.039). Ring size was unchanged with 
once-weekly dosing.
Signs and symptoms score
There was no marked difference in either regimen in 
median SSS at baseline (20 (1–36) vs 11 (7–30)). The median 
percentage fall from baseline at week 14 was greater for twice-
weekly dosing 37.5% (range −185.7 to 91.7%) compared 
with 10.2% (range −33.3 to 83.3%) for once-weekly dosing, 
although the changes were not statistically significant.

week 14 in the once-weekly cohort were 6.25 (range 0 to 
31.3, P 
= 
0.002) and 3.4 (range −2.3 to 14.8, P 
= 
0.0068) 
respectively, but these parameters did not change 
significantly with twice-weekly ATL1103.
In contrast, in the twice-weekly cohort, comparing 
baseline to week 14, the only significant finding was an 
improvement in the median absolute change for the 
appearance subsection of psychological dimension of 10.7 
(range −17.9 to 25.0, P 
= 
0.035). There was no significant 
improvement in the once-weekly cohort.
Safety
ATL1103 was well tolerated with mild-to-moderate 
injection-site reactions (ISRs) being the most common 
treatment-emergent AE, affecting 85% of patients in both 
cohorts (Table 2). Four serious AEs (SAEs) were reported, of 
which three occurred in a single patient taking the once-
daily regimen (acute bronchitis, loss of consciousness 
while driving and cholecystitis) and one in a patient 
taking the twice-daily regimen (ear infection), but none 
were felt to be study drug related; both patients completed 
the 13 weeks of therapy. Two patients from one centre 
‘withdrew consent’ at completion of dosing (weeks 13 and 
14) with study drug and thus did not participate in the 
washout period through week 21.).
One patient in each regimen had low circulating 
platelet levels at a single time point (weeks 4 and 13, 86 
and 132 
× 
109/L respectively; normal range 150 
× 
109/L), 
but these resolved either spontaneously or after treatment 
end (week 13). Two patients had elevated liver enzymes 
judged clinically significant: one patient taking the once-
daily regimen had γ-glutamyltransferase, AST, ALT and ALP 
values above the normal limit (>ULN); one patient taking 
the twice-daily regimen had AST and ALT values >ULN. 
All effects on liver function were transient (Table 3).
The treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) profile was 
comparable for the two treatment groups (Table 2). Almost 
all patients experienced ISRs (mild and moderate), and 
‘mild’ lipohypertrophy, that subsequently, resolved was 
reported in two patients. There was a greater incidence

Discussion
The technology underpinning ASO therapy is rapidly 
advancing and has the potential to offer new therapeutic 
options across a broad spectrum of diseases. Disordered 
protein production or function is implicated in most 
pathological processes, and ‘gene silencing or activating’ 
by single-stranded ASOs against target RNA sequences 
is an attractive concept that permits greater specificity 
than can be achieved with small molecules or antibodies 
(14). The synthetic structural modifications, such as the 
phosphorothioate backbone and 2′-O-methoxyethyl 
modifications, can be readily applied to whole classes of 
ASOs with only the nucleotide sequence being indication 
specific. Encouraging studies of ASOs are being reported 
against many targets, but this is the first report of the use 
of an ASO in endocrinology.
The data presented provide the ‘proof of concept’ 
that in patients with acromegaly, an ASO targeting 
the GHR can lower serum IGF-I and raise the prospect 
of a new and entirely novel therapy for acromegaly. 
Thirteen weeks of ATL1103 at a dose of 200 
mg twice 
weekly lowered median serum IGF-I by 27.8%, with 
two (15%) of 13 patients achieving an IGF-I within the 
reference range. Serum IGF-I levels were still declining at 
 
week 14 and had not returned to baseline by the end of 
the 8-week (week 21) washout period (Fig. 4), suggesting 
that the duration of ATL1103 therapy was too short to 
see maximum benefit and that prolonged treatment at the 
same doses may result in a further decline in serum IGF-I. 
 
First-order drug kinetics indicate that approximately 
four to five elimination half-lives are required to achieve 
steady-state plasma concentrations; since the tissue half-
life of ATL1103 is believed to be >4 weeks (15), this would 
suggest that between 16 and 20 weeks of treatment would 
be required for nadir IGF-I levels to be achieved.
In conjunction with the data indicating a relationship 
between the dose/kg/week and the fall in serum IGF-I, it 
seems probable that larger doses of ATL1103 administered 
for longer are likely to result in a greater fall in IGF-I and 
offer the prospect of ‘normalisation’ of IGF-I in a greater 
proportion of patients. Reassuringly, the decline in serum 
IGF-I with twice-weekly treatment was paralleled by falls 
in the other elements of the IGF ternary complex, namely 
IGFBP3 and ALS.
Circulating GHBP is the product of cleavage of the 
extracellular component of the GH receptor (16). In 
acromegaly, there is a negative correlation between serum 
GHBP concentrations and IGF-I and GH levels (17), 
such that GHBP concentrations are decreased in active 
acromegaly, and increase with conventional therapy. 
In contrast, the reduction in IGF-I caused by ATL1103 
therapy is associated with a significant decline in serum 
GHBP concentrations, which were still falling at week 14 
Figure 8

weekly ATL1103 resulted in a median decline of 48.8% in

fall of 23.6% was seen in the once-weekly cohort (P 
= 
0.027a). 
In the twice-weekly cohort, at week 21 the median fall in 
GHBP, compared to baseline, was 40.4% (P 
= 
0.008b). Medians

and had not returned to baseline by the end of washout 
at week 21. The fall in GHBP likely reflects the ATL1103-
induced downregulation of GHR cell surface number, with 
a dose–response observed, as the fall was greater with the 
twice-weekly compared to once-weekly regimen, 23.6% 
and 48.8% respectively. The changes in GHBP emphasise 
the difference in action of ATL1103 and future studies 
with increased doses of ATL1103, and larger cohorts will 
permit exploration of the relationship between the change 
in serum IGF-I and circulating GHBP concentrations.
As with pegvisomant, the reduction in serum IGF-I 
with twice-weekly ATL1103 was associated with a 46% 
increase in serum GH levels assessed during an OGTT. 
Studies with pegvisomant have demonstrated that the 
increased GH secretion is a consequence of negative 
feedback in response to the fall in circulating IGF-I 
induced by blocking GH action (18).
It is encouraging that an improvement in the soft-
tissue manifestations of acromegaly, indicated by the 
reduction in ring size, was seen with twice-weekly therapy. 
The short duration of therapy and small cohort size means 
it should not be a surprise that the fall in IGF-I was not 
associated with an improvement in SSS and only very 
modest improvements in quality of life as measured by 
AcroQol. Studies in larger numbers of patients treated for 
longer are required to demonstrate the impact of ATL1103 
on well-being and quality of life.
Almost all patients, approximately 85%, experienced 
ISRs, but otherwise ATL1103 was generally well tolerated 
with no apparent drug-related SAEs. There were four 
SAEs, of which three occurred in one patient, and all 
were judged as unlikely to be drug related; both patients 
completed the 13 weeks of therapy (Table 2). ISRs are a 
recognised side effect of second-generation ASOs, were 
mild to moderate in severity (predominantly a mixture 
of erythema, pain and pruritus) and affected both cohorts 
equally. No patient withdrew from this study because of 
ISRs. This is a similar incidence of ISRs as reported in other 
studies: 90% of patients participating in a phase 2 study 
of mipomersen experienced mild-to-moderate ISRs (19).

The mechanism of oligonucleotide-induced ISR is yet to 
be fully elucidated, but skin biopsies in 9 of 32 subjects 
participating in a phase 1 study of mipomersen were 
consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis (e.g., infiltrating 
neutrophils, prominent nuclear dust, lymphocytes and 
eosinophils with local macrophage infiltration) (20). The 
lessons learned from the numerous other ASOs under 
clinical development will inform the management of ISRs 
in future studies of ATL1103. Transient changes in platelet 
count and liver function were encountered but were 
judged not to necessitate any change in therapy. Studies 
of greater length involving larger numbers of patients are 
required before any conclusions can be drawn about the 
safety profile of ATL1103.
There were no clinically significant changes in 
pituitary tumour size, but the short duration of treatment 
precludes meaningful conclusions about the long-term 
impact of ATL1103 on this parameter. Both the patients 
in whom tumour expansion of >2 
mm was documented 
had 
discontinued 
somatostatin 
analogue 
therapy 
(one octreotide, one lanreotide) prior to commencing 
ATL1103, raising the possibility of rebound expansion 
from somatostatin analogue-induced tumour shrinkage. 
Reassuringly, the experience from more than 10-year use 
of pegvisomant is that GHR-targeted therapy does not 
induce growth of pituitary adenomas (21).
In summary, ATL1103 lowers IGF-I in acromegaly with 
biochemical changes consistent with downregulation of 
the GHR. As IGF-I was still declining at the end of the 
treatment period and with the knowledge that the dose/kg 
could be increased, ATL1103 has the potential to achieve 
disease control in a significant proportion of patients. 
Placebo-controlled studies of longer duration and using 
higher doses are needed to better assess the full potential 
of this novel treatment.
