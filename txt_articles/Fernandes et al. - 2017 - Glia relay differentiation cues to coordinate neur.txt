NEURODEVELOPMENT
Glia relay differentiation cues to
coordinate neuronal development
in Drosophila

Neuronal birth and specification must be coordinated across the developing brain to
generate the neurons that constitute neural circuits. We used the Drosophila visual system
to investigate how development is coordinated to establish retinotopy, a feature of all
visual systems. Photoreceptors achieve retinotopy by inducing their target field in the optic
lobe, the lamina neurons, with a secreted differentiation cue, epidermal growth factor
(EGF). We find that communication between photoreceptors and lamina cells requires a
signaling relay through glia. In response to photoreceptor-EGF, glia produce insulin-like
peptides, which induce lamina neuronal differentiation. Our study identifies a role for glia in
coordinating neuronal development across distinct brain regions, thus reconciling the
timing of column assembly with that of delayed differentiation, as well as the
spatiotemporal pattern of lamina neuron differentiation.
A
key challenge during neural development
is to coordinate the birth and specification
of diverse neuronal and glial cell types
across different brain regions. To probe this
process, we focused on the visual system
of Drosophila. Like vertebrate visual systems, the
fly visual system is organized retinotopically into
repeated modular circuits that process sensory
input from the entire visual field (1). The lamina
is the first ganglion in the optic lobe to receive
input from photoreceptors (1). For each of the
800 unit eyes (ommatidia) in the retina, there
is a corresponding lamina unit (cartridge) in
the optic lobe, made up of five lamina neuronal
types and multiple glial subtypes. Populating
these circuits with the correct number of cells
and cell types, and organizing them spatially,
requires that photoreceptor, lamina neuronal,
and glial development be precisely coordinated.
Photoreceptors develop progressively as a wave
of differentiation sweeps across the developing eye
imaginal disc, from posterior to anterior (Fig. 1A)
(2). Newborn photoreceptors promote wave prop-
agation by expressing Hedgehog (Hh), and recruit
additional photoreceptor subtypes to developing
ommatidia by expressing the epidermal growth
factor (EGF), Spitz (Spi) (2). As photoreceptor
axons grow into the optic lobes, they are en-
sheathed by a population of glia, called wrapping
glia. Wrapping glial morphogenesis and photo-
receptor axon ensheathment occur in response
to fibroblast growth factor (FGF) from photo-
receptors (3). Upon arrival in the optic lobes,
photoreceptors redeploy Hh and Spi to induce
their first target field, the lamina (4–7). Thus, the
differentiation wave in the eye disc ultimately
drives the development of photoreceptors, wrap-
ping glia, and the photoreceptor target field (lam-
ina neurons).
In the optic lobes, Hh from photoreceptor axons
promotes terminal divisions of neuroepithelial
cells into equipotent postmitotic lamina precursors,
which express Dachshund (Dac) (Fig. 1, A and B)
(4, 7). These precursors assemble into columns
of six to seven cells along photoreceptor axons,
also in an Hh-dependent manner (Fig. 1A) (4, 7–9).
Hh signaling promotes EGF receptor (EGFR) ex-
pression in precursors and, according to the current
model, makes them competent to respond to Spi,
which photoreceptor axons also deliver (Fig. 1A)
(5, 6). EGF from photoreceptors drives precursor
differentiation into the five lamina neuronal types,
L1 to L5, in each column [marked by embryonic
lethal abnormal vision (Elav), a pan neuronal
marker] (Fig. 1, A and B) (5). Although photo-
receptors concomitantly express Hh, which con-
trols precursor cell divisions and column assembly,
and EGF, which controls differentiation, precursors
differentiate only after column assembly is com-
pleted (2, 4, 5). Lamina precursors in each column
differentiate according to an invariant spatio-
temporal pattern, despite an apparently homog-
enous differentiation signal from photoreceptors
(EGF). In each assembled column of seven lamina
precursors, the most proximal (bottom) and most
distal (top) cells differentiate first into L5 and L2,
respectively; differentiation then proceeds in
a distal-to-proximal (top-to-bottom) sequence,
L3 forming next, followed by L1, then L4. The
two “excess” cells are later cleared by apoptosis
(Fig. 1A) (5).
We explored the possibility that other cell types,
such as glia, may be involved in coordinating
lamina neuronal differentiation with photo-
receptors. We found that EGFR in lamina pre-
cursors is dispensable for their differentiation
into neurons. Instead, photoreceptors signal to
wrapping glia with EGF and, in response, wrap-
ping glia induce L1 to L4 neuronal differentiation
by secreting insulin-like peptides. This intercellular
signaling relay couples neuronal differentiation
in the lamina with the timing of wrapping glial
morphogenesis. We suggest that it accounts for
the spatiotemporal pattern of differentiation,
which is linked to fate specification of lamina
neurons. Moreover, because glial processes arrive
in the lamina after photoreceptors, they may relay
the differentiation signal to the lamina with a lag
relative to the photoreceptor-delivered signal for
column assembly. In this way, glia help reconcile
both the timing of column assembly with that
of delayed differentiation, as well as the spatio-
temporal pattern of lamina neuron differentia-
tion. Glia thus coordinate neuronal development
across different ganglia.
Glial morphogenesis instructs lamina
neuron differentiation
To explore the coordination of glial morphogen-
esis with lamina and photoreceptor development,
we marked wrapping glia and their processes by
using a wrapping glia–specific driver to express
membrane-targeted green fluorescent protein
(GFP) (Fig. 1B and movie S1) (10). Wrapping glia
are basal to photoreceptor cell bodies in the eye
disc (3, 11–13). Their processes wrap photoreceptor
axons through the optic stalk and in the develop-
ing lamina (Fig. 1B) (12). Wrapping glial ex-
tension along photoreceptors into the optic lobes
was progressive, such that their processes invaded
the lamina further in older columns, progressing
as did differentiation (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the
leading edge of wrapping glial processes arriving
in the optic lobes correlated with the front of
neuronal differentiation in the lamina (Fig. 1B).
When we disrupted wrapping glial morphogenesis
and extension into the optic lobes by expressing
a dominant negative form of the FGF receptor
Heartless (HtlDN) (3) in wrapping glia, we ob-
served that the triangular front of differentiation
indicative of sequential L1 to L4 differentiation
was disrupted (Fig. 1C). Differentiating lamina
neurons only occupied the distal (top)–most
positions in columns. Presumptive L5 neurons
were still present but differentiated with a de-
lay of about three columns (Fig. 1C). This sug-
gests that wrapping glia are involved in lamina
differentiation.
EGFR is dispensable in lamina
precursors for differentiation
Because both wrapping glial morphogenesis
and EGF from photoreceptors are required for

 lamina neuron differentiation (5), we revisited
the original model to further characterize the role
of EGF from photoreceptors. Rhomboid (Rho)
proteins cleave Spi, making it active for secretion
(6, 14). Rho3 is specifically localized to photo-
receptor axons and rho3 mutants lack photo-
receptor axon-derived Spi, and lamina precursors
fail to differentiate, although they are recruited
into columns (6). In these mutants, Rho1 main-
tains normal Spi secretion from the cell body
such that photoreceptors are specified normally
and project appropriately to the lamina (6). Res-
cue experiments have demonstrated that the
rho3 mutant phenotype can be entirely attributed
to loss of Spi secretion from photoreceptor axons
(6). As expected, differentiating lamina neurons
exhibited dually phosphorylated mitogen-activated
protein kinase (dpMAPK), a readout for receptor
tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity, which was lost in
rho3 mutants. L1s to L4s were eliminated in rho3
mutants, as previously reported; however, L5s
differentiated but with a delay, indicating that
they follow a distinct differentiation program
from L1 to L4 and do not require EGF from
photoreceptor axons (fig. S1, C to G). We there-
after focused only on L1 to L4 differentiation,
which is abolished in the absence of EGF from
photoreceptor axons.
Although it is unambiguous that EGF from
photoreceptors is required for lamina neuronal
differentiation, the lack of cell type–specific tools
at the time the original model was formulated
precluded testing whether EGFR and MAPK are
required specifically in the lamina for L1 to L4 to
differentiate (5). To test this, we used a lamina-
specific Gal4 (10) to drive a dominant negative
form of EGFR (EGFRDN) in lamina precursors
and in differentiating lamina neurons (fig. S2A).
This did not prevent lamina neuron differenti-
ation as Elav-positive cells were observed. How-
ever, lamina morphology was disrupted, likely
due to apoptosis of lamina cells (fig. S2A). Pre-
venting cell death by expressing the baculovi-
rus caspase inhibitor P35 along with EGFRDN
restored lamina morphology, revealing that the
pattern of differentiation was unaffected by block-
ing EGFR activity in the lamina (Fig. 1, E and H).
Thus, although EGFR appears to be required in
lamina cells for their survival, they do not re-
quire it to differentiate, which implies that photo-
receptors do not communicate directly with lamina
precursors through EGF.
Although EGFR is not required for differentiat-
ing lamina neurons, MAPK signaling was active
in these cells (fig. S1A), likely downstream of
another RTK (15). To investigate whether MAPK
signaling is required for lamina neuron differen-
tiation, we blocked transcription downstream of
MAPK by expressing an activated form of the
negative regulator of the pathway, anterior open
(AopACT), in lamina precursors (fig. S2, B and C).
Differentiation was blocked, and lamina mor-
phology was also disrupted (again, likely due to
apoptosis) (fig. S2C). Blocking cell death by co-
expressing P35 with AopACT restored lamina
morphology. However, lamina neuron differen-
tiation was still prevented (Fig. 1, F and H). To

 determine whether MAPK activation could drive
ectopic neuronal differentiation, we expressed
an activated form of MAPK (MAPKACT) in the
lamina (Fig. 1G). Instead of a triangular front of
differentiation, indicative of sequential differ-
entiation, most lamina columns differentiated
immediately after formation, and many more
differentiated cells were present (Fig. 1, G and
H). Importantly, MAPK was sufficient to drive
lamina differentiation even in the absence of
EGF from photoreceptors in a rho3 mutant (sup-
plementary text and fig. S2). These data show
that MAPK signaling in lamina precursor cells
is both necessary and sufficient for lamina neu-
ronal differentiation.
Lamina differentiation requires
photoreceptor-activated EGFR in glia
Because photoreceptors signal through EGF but
lamina precursors do not respond to it, we hy-
pothesized that photoreceptors signal to wrapping
glia, which relay cues to lamina precursors. We
investigated whether glia respond to Spi from
photoreceptor axons: Wrapping glial nuclei (lo-
cated in eye discs) had reduced levels of dpMAPK
in rho3 mutants relative to controls (Fig. 2, A to C)
(remaining activity likely due to FGFR signaling),
indicating that photoreceptor axon–derived Spi
activated the EGFR pathway in wrapping glia.
To evaluate the function of active EGFR
signaling in wrapping glia, we used a wrapping
glia–specific Gal4 line to express EGFRDN. Glial
ensheathment of photoreceptor axons was not
affected by this manipulation (movies S1 to S3).
However, the L1 to L4 triangular front of neu-
ronal differentiation was absent (Fig. 2, D, E,
and J). L5 differentiation was unaffected (Figs. 2,
D, E, and J), as L5-specific markers were ex-
pressed in the proximal row of the developing
lamina (fig. S2H) (see table S1 for description of
neuronalsubtype-specificmarkers)(16). Thesedata
show that active EGFR signaling in wrapping glia
is necessary for L1 to L4 but not L5 differentiation.
Together our data suggest that photoreceptors
do not signal directly to lamina precursors. Rather,
wrappinggliarespondto EGFfromphotoreceptors
to induce L1 to L4 differentiation. We therefore
asked whether activating the EGFR pathway in
wrapping glia alone could bypass the require-
ment for EGF from photoreceptors and rescue L1
to L4 differentiation in the lamina. We expressed
an activated form of EGFR (EGFRACT) in wrap-
ping glia in a rho3 mutant background. In this
genotype, photoreceptor axons could not secrete
EGF, but EGFR signaling was activated only in
wrapping glia. Lamina differentiation was rescued,
and all L1 to L4 cell types were recovered (Fig. 2,
G, I, and J; fig. S4; and table S1). Similar results
were obtained when we expressed activated Ras
(RasV12) in wrapping glia in rho3 mutants (fig.
S2, I and J). These results argue that EGF from
photoreceptor axons activates EGFR in wrapping
glia, which is both necessary and sufficient to
induce L1 to L4 differentiation.
Glial insulin-like peptides induce
lamina differentiation
Because lamina precursors require active MAPK
signaling to differentiate into neurons (Fig. 1, F
to H), we reasoned that the differentiation signal
from wrapping glia must act through an RTK
upstream of MAPK. The Drosophila genome
encodes 20 RTKs, although only 10 lie upstream
of MAPK signaling (15). Of these, we focused on
the insulin receptor (InR) as, in other instances,

 glia can use insulin/insulin-like growth factor
signaling to communicate with neural progen-
itors (17, 18). In Drosophila, seven insulin-like
peptides (Ilp1 to Ilp7) bind to and activate the
sole Drosophila InR (19). Chico is the only insulin
receptor substrate in Drosophila (20) and acts to
stabilize binding of activated InR to PI3-Kinase
(PI3K) and growth factor receptor–bound pro-
tein 2 (Grb2), leading to activation of PI3K and
MAPK signaling, respectively (fig. S3A) (21, 22).
Thus, chico mutants have low levels of insulin
signaling. Differentiating L1 to L4s were missing
in large regions of all chico mutant laminas (~20%
of the lamina) (Fig. 3B). In other regions of the
same mutant brains, no or partial loss of differ-
entiated lamina neurons was evident. A viable
hypomorphic allelic combination for InR showed
similar differentiation defects (fig. S3B) (21, 22).
To determine whether InR and Chico were signal-
ing through PI3K or through MAPK, we used
Chico constructs that rescue both or only one or
the other of the downstream signaling pathways
(21): InR requires signaling through MAPK but
not PI3K for lamina neuronal differentiation
(supplementary text and fig. S3, C to E).
To activate InR in lamina precursors and
induce L1 to L4 neuronal differentiation, wrapping
glia must secrete Ilps in response to EGF from
photoreceptors. Although the central brain insulin-
producing cells secrete several Ilps that act sys-
temically, Ilps can also be developmentally and
regionally expressed (17, 18, 23). Ilp2, Ilp3, and
Ilp5 are only expressed in insulin-producing cells
in the central brain complex (23, 24). We were
unable to test for wrapping glial expression of
Ilp1 and Ilp4 due to a lack of reporters. However,
reporter constructs for Ilp6 and Ilp7 both drove
GFP expression in wrapping glia (Fig. 3, C and D),
and Ilp6-Gal4 expression in wrapping glia was
dramatically decreased in rho3 mutants (fig. S3,
F and G). Neither Ilp6 nor Ilp7 single mutants
showed defects in lamina neuronal differentia-
tion (fig. S3, H and I); however, Ilps are known to
act redundantly, and removal of some Ilps can
lead to compensatory regulation by others (24).
Therefore, to disrupt Ilp function, we ectopically
expressed a secreted antagonist of Ilps, imaginal
morphogenesis protein L2 (Imp-L2) (25–27), in
large actin-flip-out clones (fig. S3J). Consistent
with the chico and InR mutant data, blocking Ilp
activity by ImpL2 misexpression led to an almost
complete loss of L1 to L4 neuronal differentia-
tion (fig. S3J). Thus, secreted Ilps are required for
lamina differentiation.
Because Ilp6 in wrapping glia is lost in the
absence of EGF from photoreceptors, we asked
whether restoring Ilp6 in wrapping glia was suf-
ficient to induce L1 to L4 differentiation. Ex-
pressing Ilp6 in wrapping glia in a rho3 mutant
background rescued the L1 to L4 triangular front
of differentiation (Fig. 3, F and H). Moreover,
all L1 to L4 subtypes were recovered (figs. S3K
and S4 and table S1). dpMAPK expression in the
lamina was also restored (fig. S3, L and M), fur-
ther confirming that Ilp6 is sufficient to activate
the MAPK branch of insulin signaling during
lamina neuronal differentiation. We also tested
whether ectopically activating InR (with InRACT)
in the lamina could bypass all exogenous cues to
rescue lamina neuronal differentiation in a rho3
mutant background (Fig. 3, G and H). Although
several rows of Elav-positive cells were recovered,
they were disorganized (Fig. 3, G and H). These
cells included L1s, L2/3s, and L5s but no L4s
(figs. S3N and S4 and table S1). Altogether, our
data show that wrapping glia receive EGF from
photoreceptors and respond to produce insulin-
like peptides that induce differentiation of lamina
precursors by activating MAPK.
The signaling relay may serve to
delay differentiation
Because photoreceptors could signal directly to
lamina precursors (4, 7), but instead act through
glia, we sought to understand the advantages of
this relay mechanism. Glial processes arrive in
the optic lobes after photoreceptor axons (Fig. 1B).
Thus, the relay may delay the differentiation cue
to ensure that column assembly is completed
before differentiation initiates. To test this, we
supplied Ilp6 directly from photoreceptors in
rho3 mutants to bypass glial signaling (Fig. 4).
We expressed Ilp6 with two panphotoreceptor
drivers that differed in the onset of their ex-
pression: The first was expressed in early-born
photoreceptors, and the second was delayed rel-
ative to photoreceptor birth (Fig. 4, C and D). We
predicted that column assembly (6 to 7 lamina
precursors/column) would not be completed

 reliably when photoreceptors delivered assembly
and differentiation cues simultaneously (early
driver), because lamina precursors would differ-
entiate too early. However, if the differentiation
cue was delayed, the correct number of lamina
precursors would assemble into columns before
differentiating. Although early photoreceptor-
delivered Ilp6 expression rescued lamina neu-
ronal differentiation in a rho3 mutant, fewer
lamina precursors incorporated into columns
on average (4.4 lamina precursors per column
± 0.99 SD; N = 4 optic lobes) (Fig. 4C). Moreover,
Elav expression initiated in the youngest column
that contained four or fewer lamina precursors,
indicating that they were still being assembled
(Fig. 4C). When Ilp6 was expressed with the
delayed-onset photoreceptor driver in rho3 mu-
tants, lamina neuronal differentiation had only
initiated in old columns at ~10 hours after pu-
parium formation (APF) (Fig. 4D). However, col-
umns contained 6 to 7 precursors each (±0.88
SD; N = 4 optic lobes) (Fig. 4C), indicating that
column assembly was less disrupted compared
with early-onset Ilp6 expression. By ~15 hours
APF, all photoreceptors expressed Ilp6, and neu-
ronal differentiation was widespread, suggesting
that differentiation could “catch up” (Fig. 4E).
Nonetheless, the pattern was disrupted, because
the number of neurons in each column did not
reflect the age of the column (Fig. 5E). These data
suggest that the relay from photoreceptors to
wrapping glia to lamina precursors may function
to segregate column assembly from differentia-
tion in time.
Discussion
In Drosophila, photoreceptors establish reti-
notopy between the retina and their target field,
the lamina, by inducing lamina units, each con-
taining five neurons. This is a multistep process
requiring lamina precursor generation and as-
sembly into naïve columns, followed by their
differentiation into L1 to L5 according to an
invariant spatiotemporal pattern. We showed
that L1 to L4 differentiation is the consequence
of an intercellular signaling relay from photo-
receptors to wrapping glia and then to lamina
precursors (Fig. 5). Rather than instructing lamina
neuronal differentiation directly, EGF secreted
from photoreceptor axons activates the EGFR
pathway in glia (Fig. 5); in turn, glia induce lamina
precursors to differentiate into L1 to L4 through
local insulinand MAPK signaling(Fig. 5). Although
photoreceptor axons require InR to target the
lamina (28), targeting was unaffected in rho3
mutants (where L1 to L4 do not differentiate due
to reduced glial Ilps). It is therefore unlikely that
wrapping glial Ilps also guide photoreceptor axon
targeting.
Intercellular signaling relays are used in various
contexts during development (17, 18, 29, 30). In
the context of the lamina, the glial relay serves
several purposes: (i) The delayed arrival of glial
processes into the optic lobes relative to photo-
receptor axons temporally segregates column
assembly from differentiation (Fig. 4). The relay
from photoreceptors to glia to lamina precursors
could therefore be a mechanism to ensure that
column assembly is completed before differenti-
ation initiates, leading to reproducible numbers
of precursors in each column (Fig. 4). (ii) The
spatiotemporal pattern of lamina neuronal dif-
ferentiation is likely a consequence of being
coupled to progressive glial morphogenesis. Glial
wrapping is itself coordinated independently

but variable because some columns contained more differentiated neurons
than their older neighbors (arrowhead). Scale bar, 10 mm.

 by FGF from photoreceptors (Fig. 5) (3). Thus,
photoreceptors independently regulate the ability
of wrapping glia to induce differentiation in the
lamina as well as the timing and pattern of this
induction. All wrapping glia–driven rescues of
the rho3 mutant generated all lamina neuron
subtypes (fig. S4 and table S1). However, this was
not the case for lamina-driven rescues of rho3,
which produced aberrant subtypes while some-
times lacking others (fig. S4 and table S1). By
signaling through glia, photoreceptors may be
translating a homogeneous cue (EGF) into a
spatiotemporally graded one, which appears es-
sential for diversifying (L1 to L4) neuronal fates.
(iii) Glial cells may be well suited for integrating
sparse cues to interpret them into stronger or
more robust signals (31). Thus, by amplifying
cues from photoreceptors, glia may help reduce
noise or variability of the signaling outcome.

Fig. 5. A signaling relay from photoreceptors
to glia to lamina precursors instructs lamina
differentiation. Model: Photoreceptors secrete
EGF and FGF, which activate EGFR and FGFR,
respectively, in wrapping glia. EGFR activation
is required for glial expression of Ilps, which
activate InR and MAPK in lamina precursors
leading to L1 to L4 differentiation. FGFR signaling
regulates glia morphogenesis and process
extension into the brain (3) and therefore
indirectly regulates the timing and patterning
of L1 to L4 differentiation.
