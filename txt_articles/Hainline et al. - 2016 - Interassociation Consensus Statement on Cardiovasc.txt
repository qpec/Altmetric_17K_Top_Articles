Cardiovascular evaluation and care of college student-athletes is
gaining increasing attention from both the public and medical
communities. Emerging strategies include screening of the
general athlete population, recommendations of permissible levels
of participation by athletes with identified cardiovascular condi-
tions, and preparation for responding to unanticipated cardiac
events in athletic venues. The primary focus has been sudden
cardiac death and the utility of screening with or without advanced
cardiac screening. The National Collegiate Athletic Association
convened a multidisciplinary task force to address cardiovascular
concerns in collegiate student-athletes and to develop consensus
for an interassociation statement. This document summarizes the
task force deliberations and follow-up discussions, and includes
available evidence on cardiovascular risk, pre-participation
evaluation, and the recognition of and response to cardiac arrest.

 T
he National Collegiate Athletic Association
(NCAA) convened a multidisciplinary task force
at its headquarters in Indianapolis, Indiana, from
September 23 to 24, 2014, to address cardiovascular care in
the collegiate student-athlete (see Online Appendix for a
list of participants). The purpose of the task force was to
discuss and evaluate cardiovascular concerns in collegiate
student-athletes and to develop an interassociation consen-
sus statement and recommendations for the future. The
primary focus was sudden cardiac death and the utility of
screening with or without electrocardiogram (not including
echocardiogram). Other, more general cardiovascular issues
were discussed in breakout groups. This Executive

review process.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: INTERASSOCIATION
CONSENSUS STATEMENT ON CARDIOVASCULAR
CARE OF COLLEGE STUDENT-ATHLETES
THE PRE-PARTICIPATION EVALUATION.
1. The purpose of the pre-participation evaluation is to
identify conditions that may put the student-athlete at
unreasonable risk of death or catastrophic injury, with
the potential to modify and reduce risk through
individualized management. In addition, the pre-partic-
ipation evaluation provides the following opportunities:
a. to ensure that current health problems are managed
appropriately;
b. to identify conditions that serve as barriers to
performance;
c. to allow the student-athlete an opportunity to
establish a relationship with the team physician,
athletic trainer, and other members of the medical
team who may be involved in providing continuing
medical care;
d. to assess for characteristics that may place the
student-athlete at risk for future injury or disease;
e. to review medications and/or supplements, including
addressing possible Therapeutic Use Exemption
requests; and
f. to educate student-athletes regarding health risks,
health-related behavior, and pertinent issues regard-
ing safe play in sport.
2. Although all models of cardiac screening require more
research and education to improve and validate both
performance and feasibility, the NCAA supports, in
concept, pre-participation cardiovascular screening us-
ing a comprehensive personal and family history and
physical examination, such as the American Heart
Association (AHA) 14-point recommendations and/or
the Pre-Participation Physical Evaluation Monograph,
Fourth Edition (PPE-4).
3. The pre-participation evaluation process should be
formalized and in writing.
a. The member institution’s pre-participation examina-
tion should be conducted on campus under the
supervision of the institution’s director of medical
services, or, if an off-campus approach is used,
evaluations should be reviewed in a process super-
vised by the institution’s director of medical services.
The director of medical services should identify 1
clinician provider at the medical doctor/doctor of
osteopathic medicine level (most likely the head team
physician) and 1 clinician provider at the athletic
trainer level (most likely the head athletic trainer)
who will be charged with the responsibility for
ensuring that the pre-participation cardiac screening
is conducted with the necessary components, as
documented in the following text. Medical records of
the examination should be kept in an accessible,
secure file for at least the duration of the student-
athlete’s college career, and should accompany the
athlete during any school transfers.
4. As afforded by local resources, cardiac screening on
campus is encouraged in an effort to maintain a
consistent and high-quality level of care.
a. For member institutions that choose to rely on
external care providers to provide preparticipation
evaluations, an on-campus mechanism should be
established to confirm that the pre-participation
evaluations are thoroughly reviewed. The goal of
the review is to ensure follow-up and completion of
any potential abnormal finding (either confirmed or
dismissed) prior to organized athletic participation.
5. To ensure that team physicians are chosen and retained
on the basis of broadly accepted criteria, member
institutions that choose, appoint, and oversee team
physicians should be familiar with the ‘‘Team Physician
Consensus Statement: 2013 Update’’ (1).
6. It is recognized that many member institutions utilize
the electrocardiogram (ECG) as part of preparticipation
cardiac screening, even though there is no consensus as
to the short-and long-term risk/benefit ratio of such an
approach. For those member schools that choose to
utilize the ECG as part of the pre-participation cardiac
screening, the following guidance is provided:
a. Pre-ECG screening planning and coordination:
� Before pre-participation physicals are conducted,
team physicians, athletic trainers, and athletic
administrators should meet to discuss the execution
of ECG screening in student-athletes. A cardiovas-
cular specialist with the requisite expertise to
provide athlete ECG over-reading services and to
coordinate any downstream testing dictated by
ECG abnormalities should be identified.
� The implementation of ECG screening for all
student-athletes versus targeted high-risk groups
should be discussed and agreed upon.
� Student-athletes should be provided information
regarding the rationale for utilizing ECG screening
and the possible risk versus benefit of adding ECG
screening.
� The standards for ECG interpretation should be
reviewed and agreed upon, and avenues for prompt
secondary cardiac testing of ECG abnormalities
outlined.
b. Screening protocol:
� ECG screening should be implemented as part of
an integrated cardiovascular screen using a stan-
dardized history and physical examination, such as
the AHA 14-point recommendations or the PPE-4.
Journal of Athletic Training
345
 � The ECG should be obtained with equipment and
by persons trained according to American College
of Cardiology ACC/AHA/Heart Rhythm Society
recommendations (2).
c. Interpretation and secondary testing:
� The ECG should be interpreted with modern
standards that distinguish normal findings related
to physiological cardiac remodeling in trained
athletes from abnormalities suggestive of an
underlying pathological cardiac condition.
� Consensus guidelines on ECG interpretation in
athletes and a free, online training course are
available online at the BMJ Learning web site (3).
� The institution should provide cardiology oversight
and resources, either on-site or at a regional referral
center, to interpret suspicious ECGs and guide and
perform secondary testing that may be required for
athletes whose ECG results call for further
clarification.
d. Management of identified cardiac conditions associ-
ated with sudden cardiac death (SCD):
� In keeping with the NCAA’s requirement that each
member institution is responsible for protecting the
health of and providing a safe environment for each
student-athlete, the management of identified
cardiac disorders and all sport eligibility decisions
are ultimately the responsibility of the institutional
primary athletics health care providers, in consul-
tation with subspecialty consultants, including a
primary cardiology point person.
� The ACC/AHA provides recommendations for safe
participation in athletes with cardiovascular condi-
tions that can be used as an initial guideline. A
model that utilizes a comprehensive evaluation,
extensive patient/family counseling, and prudent
medical management for risk reduction and
informed decisionmaking that involves all key
stakeholders in the oversight of the athlete (e.g.,
coaches, athletic trainers, team physicians, and
athletic directors) provides a sensible strategy to
structure difficult cardiac clearance decisions.
RECOGNITION AND RESPONSE TO CARDIAC
ARREST, INCLUDING EMERGENCY ACTION PLANS.
1. Best practices strongly recommend a written emergency
action plan (EAP) for the treatment of cardiac arrest.
Online resources are available from the AHA (4).
Essential aspects of the plan include:
a. Ensuring the training of anticipated responders in
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated
external defibrillator (AED) use. Such training should
not be limited to athletic trainers and team physi-
cians, but should rather be inclusive, including, but
not limited to, strength and conditioning coaches,
sport coaches, and administrative personnel with
consideration in student-athletes, as resources allow.
b. Establishing an effective emergency communication
system. The communication system should be in
place before the beginning of the academic year.
c. Ensuring easy access to early defibrillation.
� Easy access means that there should be AEDs in
the immediate vicinity (within a 3-min walk) of all
high-risk locations, including, but not limited to:
the weight room/strength and conditioning room,
basketball court(s), football/soccer/lacrosse/base-
ball/softball fields, track and field space, and
indoor or other training facilities.
d. Ensuring properly charged and functioning AEDs.
There should be a checklist maintained for each AED
that indicates the date when the AED was checked
and by whom. This should be an assigned function,
and the check should occur at least monthly for both
the battery charge and the electrode pads. A
‘‘readiness’’ check by the athletic trainer or team
physician before each practice or competition is
encouraged. Manufacturer guidelines should be
followed.
e. Integrating on-site responder and AED programs with
the local emergency medical services (EMS) system.
Such integration should be developed before the
beginning of the academic year, and should differ-
entiate routine practice from competitions. For
anticipated high-volume competitions (e.g., football/
basketball games), the point of entry/exit for
emergency medical responders/vehicles should be
clearly established beforehand.
f. Practicing and reviewing the emergency response
plan at least annually.
INTRODUCTION
The NCAA convened a multidisciplinary task force at its
headquarters in Indianapolis, Indiana, from September 23
to 24, 2014, to address cardiovascular care in the collegiate
student-athlete (see Online Appendix for a list of
participants). The purpose of the task force was to discuss
and evaluate cardiovascular concerns in collegiate student-
athletes and to develop an interassociation consensus
statement and recommendations for the future. The primary
focus was sudden cardiac death and the utility of screening
with or without ECG (not including echocardiogram).
Other more general cardiovascular issues were discussed in
breakout groups. This document summarizes the task force
and follow-up discussions with task force members during
the review process. The document addresses:
1. Cardiovascular risk in collegiate student-athletes.
2. The pre-participation evaluation.
3. Evidence evaluating the efficacy of preparticipation
screening for detection of cardiovascular risk.
4. ECG as a screening tool for sudden cardiac death risk
prediction
5. Regional referral centers for evaluation of athletes
suspected or known to have a cardiovascular condition.
6. Recognition and response to cardiac arrest.
7. Cardiac research initiatives.
This document also includes an Executive Summary of
recommendations and a checklist of best practices for
NCAA member institutions (Table 1).
CARDIOVASCULAR RISK IN COLLEGIATE
STUDENT-ATHLETES
Whereas there is a general health benefit from regular
exercise (5), sports participation presents additional risk for
346
Volume 51 � Number 4 � April 2016
 injuries (6,7). Although sports activity during exertion,
including both training and competition, has been report-
edly associated with an increased risk for SCD (8,9), the
issue remains incompletely resolved (10).
For the purposes of this document, SCD is defined as an
unexpected death due to cardiac causes that occurs in a
short time period in a person with or without previously
known cardiovascular disease. SCD should be differentiat-
ed from exertion-related death in athletes that is not from a
primary cardiac cause, for example, heat stroke and
rhabdomyolysis (11). SCD in NCAA student-athletes is
variously cited as either an uncommon event (12–14) or as
an event that occurs with such regularity that it demands
further scrutiny (15–17). As with many epidemiological
debates, the truth depends on how the question is framed,
the methodological approach utilized, and the determina-
tion of whether SCD occurred during or soon after sport
participation or occurred as part of the larger population-
risk of SCD. Estimates of SCD for U.S. college athletes
range from 1 in 43,000 (0.0023%) to 1 in 83,000
(0.0012%), and some athlete groups appear to be at a
higher risk (12,15,17); the SCD mortality rate is lower
when post-mortem data is used to establish cardiovascular
diagnosis (10). The most common nontraumatic cause of
death among college athletes is SCD (17), and SCD
represents approximately 75% of fatalities in college
student-athletes during sport and exercise (15). For over
30 years, 5 to 10 NCAA student-athletes have died per year
of SCD; however, the number of athletes with cardiac arrest
who survived is unknown (18).
NCAA-focused research led to an analysis of SCD in
NCAA athletes over a 10-year period (2003 to 2013)
(15,17). The analysis was conducted using cases identified
in the NCAA Memorial Resolutions list, media reports, and
NCAA catastrophic insurance data. Autopsy reports were
reviewed when possible, and only cases with confirmed
cardiac etiologies or circumstances consistent with SCD
were included. The overall risk of SCD in an NCAA
student-athlete during or soon after exertion is estimated at
1 in 54,000 athletes/ year (0.0019%). The exertion-related
risk of SCD in a male athlete is 1 in 38,000 (0.0026%),
which is higher than the 1 in 122,000 (0.00082%) risk for a
female athlete, although SCD in female athletes still
accounts for 20% of all cases. African-American athlete
SCD risk is 1 in 22,000 (0.0045%), which is 3x higher than
the 1 in 68,000 (0.0015%) risk in a Caucasian athlete (17).
Some athlete groups are at higher risk than others. A male
basketball student-athlete has an exertion-related SCD risk
of 1 in 9,000 (0.011%), which is higher than any other
athlete group (17). The risk of SCD in Division I men’s
basketball or in an African-American male basketball
player from any division is as high as 1 in 5,200 (0.019%).
Other athlete groups with higher risk than average include
men’s soccer (1 in 24,000 or 0.0042%), football (1 in
36,000 or 0.0028%), and women’s cross-country (1 in
47,000 or 0.0021%) (17). Men’s basketball accounts for

Pre-Participation Evaluation of Student-Athletes
u The purpose of the evaluation, as stated in the 2014-15 NCAA Sports Medicine Handbook (19), is explained to the student-athlete.
u The cardiac evaluation includes, at minimum, a comprehensive personal and family history, and physical examination, such as the AHA 14-
point evaluation or the Pre-participation Physical Evaluation Monograph, Fourth Edition.
u The pre-participation evaluation is either conducted on campus under the supervision of the institution’s director of medical services or is
reviewed by a process that is supervised by the institution’s director of medical services.
u If an ECG is included in addition to history and physical screening, best practices include:
u Pre-ECG screening planning is performed with a multidisciplinary team
u The student athlete is provided an in-depth explanation for the rationale of ECG screening and the possible risk vs. benefit of adding ECG
screening.
u Modern athlete-specific ECG interpretation standards are used.
u Skilled cardiology oversight is available.
Emergency Action Plan for Cardiac Arrest
u A written emergency action plan for treatment of cardiac arrest is in place and has been reviewed and rehearsed among the following key
personnel:
u All primary athletic healthcare providers (athletic trainers and team physicians).
u Athletic director and director of medical services.
u All strength and conditioning coaches.
u The emergency action plan for cardiac arrest addresses each of the following:
u All athletic trainers, team physicians, and strength and conditioning coaches have received training/certification in CPR and AED use.
u A communication system has been established that ensures a rapid and coordinated response to cardiac arrest, both internally and for
emergency medical services.
u AEDs are placed strategically near all high-risk venues, including weight rooms, indoor arenas/courts, practice facilities, stadiums, and fields
where organized sports take place.
u Signage is clearly visible and strategically placed to indicate the location of each AED.
u AEDS are never behind locked doors and are checked (with appropriate signoff) at least monthly for proper battery charge and functional
electrode pads.
u Emergency medical service entry and exit are pre-determined and secured for all high-volume events.
This checklist can be used as a resource when evaluating institutional cardiac care plans. The checklist has been designed to help
institutions become better informed and educated about the best practices that are endorsed in this interassociation document. Please note
that the ‘‘Interassociation Consensus Statement on Cardiovascular Care of College Student-Athletes’’ does not provide prescriptive details
regarding clinical care, as such care is individualized for the needs of each student-athlete and is on the basis of consensus-and evidence-
based care that is consistent with the standards of a team physician and cardiovascular consultant.

 only 4% of male NCAA athletes, but nearly 20% of all
SCD cases. Men’s basketball and football together
represent 23% of all male NCAA athletes, but those 2
sports alone account for 50% of all SCD cases. These
values should be interpreted with some caution, given the
low absolute number of annual SCD occurrences, which
makes accurate assessment of the rate of SCD in subgroups
subject to large yearly variations.
THE PRE-PARTICIPATION EVALUATION
The NCAA currently requires every student-athlete to
undergo a pre-participation evaluation conducted by a
licensed medical doctor (MD) or doctor of osteopathic
medicine (DO) prior to participation in an NCAA sport.
The pre-participation evaluation is required upon matric-
ulation to an institution (administered within 6 months
prior to the student-athlete’s participation in any practice,
competition, or out-of-season conditioning activities for
the applicable academic year) with an annually updated
health history questionnaire and blood pressure measure-
ment. The 2014-15 NCAA Sports Medicine Handbook (19)
stipulates that the medical evaluation should include a
comprehensive health history, an immunization history,
and a relevant physical examination, concentrating on the
cardiac, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems. The
medical evaluation must also include confirmation of
sickle cell trait status, a solubility test for sickle cell trait,
or a release declining the test. In addition, the ‘‘Inter
Association Consensus: Diagnosis and Management of
Sport-Related Concussion Guidelines’’ (20), which were
released in July 2014, recommend that all student-athletes
undergo a 1-time baseline concussion assessment inclu-
sive of concussion history, symptom evaluation, and
cognitive and balance assessment. With regard to the
pre-participation cardiac evaluation, the 2014-15 NCAA
Sports Medicine Handbook (19) states that consideration
should be given to implementing the recommendations
from the AHA or the PPE-4 (21,22).
The NCAA currently does not define the purpose of the
pre-participation evaluation. Furthermore, the NCAA does
not currently require: 1) that the institution’s team
physician conduct the medical evaluation; 2) that the
institution’s team physician and/or director of medical
services review preparticipation evaluations performed by
outside physicians; or 3) that pre-participation evaluations
fulfill established criteria.
Various medical societies and authorities have charac-
terized the screening objective of the preparticipation
evaluation as a means to identify or raise suspicion of
cardiovascular abnormalities and diseases that are associ-
ated with unsafe sport participation in general or SCD in
particular (10,21–25) and as a way to enhance the safety
of athletic participation (26,27). These screening objec-
tives differ from general education and wellness goals.
Specifically, all of these screening objectives share a
common element: the identification of potentially life-
threatening conditions for which participation in compet-
itive sports would place the athlete at a level of increased
risk that some might find unacceptable, given the potential
consequences.
The AHA issued recommendations for the preparticipa-
tion screening of competitive athletes in 1996 (26) and in
2007 (28). These recommendations included a 12-point
personal and family history and physical examination, and
were promoted as a potentially effective strategy to raise
the suspicion of cardiovascular disease in athletes (28). In
2014, the AHA published updated pre-participation recom-
mendations regarding cardiovascular screening and extend-
ed the scope to include all generally healthy young people
between 12 and 25 years of age (10). The 2014
recommendations did not recommend large-scale, general
population, and universal cardiovascular screening with
history and physical examination, citing no evidence of
benefit. However, if done in athletes or other relatively
small cohorts of young, healthy people 12 to 25 years of
age, the AHA recommendations affirmed the use of the
previous screening guidelines and added 2 additional
questions that led to a 14-point history and physical
evaluation to raise the suspicion of cardiovascular disease
(Table 2). Additionally, the AHA recommended standard-
ization of forms used to guide the examination for high
school and college athletes.
The Pre-Participation Physical Evaluation Monograph
was first published in 1992 and has undergone periodic
revisions, with the latest (fourth) edition published in 2010
(21). The Monograph is a joint project of 6 medical
organizations representing a wide range of physicians who
perform pre-participation evaluations, with the latest
edition endorsed by the AHA. The monograph includes a
recommended standardized history questionnaire; there are
12 personal and family history questions related to
cardiovascular screening on the basis of the AHA
guidelines. The history questions from the PPE-4 and the
AHA 14-point recommendations utilize slightly different
wording and syntax, and are compared in Table 2.
Importantly, the pre-participation evaluation offers many
opportunities beyond screening for the identification of
serious cardiovascular conditions. As noted in the Interna-
tional Olympic Committee Consensus Statement on
Periodic Health Evaluation of Elite Athletes (24), the pre-
participation/periodic health evaluation can also serve the
following functions:
1. To ensure that current health problems are managed
appropriately;
2. To identify conditions that are barriers to performance;
3. To allow the athlete an opportunity to establish a
relationship with the health personnel who will be involved
in providing continuing care;
4. To look for characteristics that may put the elite athlete at
risk for future injury or disease;
5. To review medications and/or supplements, including
addressing possible therapeutic use exemption requests; and
6. To educate athletes regarding health risks and health-
related behavior.
The pre-participation evaluation does not need to focus
exclusively on current health and performance issues, but
can also provide an opportunity to assess the risk for future
health and quality of life matters (24). For example,
hypertension stage 1 or early metabolic syndrome,
conditions that predispose to subsequent cardiovascular
disease (29,30), may be noted and addressed. Such
anticipatory care can prevent future medical problems.
With regard to education, platforms can be developed
that allow dissemination of information about key areas
348
Volume 51 � Number 4 � April 2016
 of student-athlete health, such as tobacco and recrea-
tional drug use, dietary patterns, performance-enhancing
supplement use, concussion, weight management, and
mental health (31). Finally, the pre-participation evalu-
ation offers an opportunity to encourage compliance
among team physicians with consensus recommendations
and legislation (e.g., sickle cell trait) (1,32). To ensure
that team physicians are chosen and retained on the basis
of broadly accepted criteria, member institutions that
choose, appoint, and oversee team physicians should be
familiar with the ‘‘Team Physician Consensus Statement:
2013 Update’’ (1).

 EVIDENCE EVALUATING THE EFFICACY OF PRE-
PARTICIPATION SCREENING FOR DETECTION OF
CARDIOVASCULAR RISK
Pre-participation screening has been conducted in the
United States for more than 50 years. However, there is
limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of pre-
participation screening to achieve the generally agreed-
upon primary objective: the prevention of sports-related
death in athletes. The history questions designed to detect
previously undiagnosed cardiovascular conditions were
developed through expert consensus and have never been
validated scientifically. The generally broad and nonspe-
cific questions also elicit a high number of positive
responses in athletes. In college athletes, at least 1 positive
cardiovascular symptom or family history response was
reported by 24% to 43% of athletes during pre-participation
evaluations using either the AHA 12-point or PPE-4
questionnaires (33,34). In high school athletes, initial
positive history responses were reported by 68% of athletes
undergoing a heart screen using the PPE-4 history questions
(35). These responses have been considered ‘‘false
positive’’ responses by some investigators (34), but a
positive response on a screening questionnaire must be
differentiated from a true positive response on the basis of
careful follow-up questions by the clinician. The AHA
recommends review of positive questionnaire responses by
physicians to determine if further evaluation is warranted;
however, the ability of practitioners to discern true positive
from false positive responses has also never been studied
prospectively in a large-scale clinical trial.
Similarly, the addition of a resting 12-lead ECG to
screening protocols has also never been shown, in an
adequately designed study, to prevent SCD death in athletes.
Nevertheless, some authorities do recommend the use of a
resting 12-lead ECG during the preparticipation cardiovas-
cular screening of athletes (33,34,36). Several studies have
examined the ability of history, physical examination, and
ECG to detect potentially life-threatening cardiovascular
disease (which does not necessarily equate with identifying
individuals who will actually experience a cardiac event). In
general, the pre-participation history and physical examina-
tion have shown low sensitivity, high specificity, and a very
low positive predictive value for identifying potentially lethal
cardiac disorders (Table 3) (37). The majority of athletes
(60% to 80%) who experience SCD do not have recognized
warning signs or symptoms prior to their event; therefore, this
group will go undetected when screened by a protocol
primarily reliant on questioning about prior symptoms
(38,39). Because there is a high initial positive response rate
to the recommended screening questions, and because
symptoms leading up to SCD may be subtle or absent, it is
critical that physicians conducting preparticipation examina-
tions be well trained. Some data suggests that symptoms in
patients with primary structural, functional, or electrical
cardiac abnormalities may, in fact, be misinterpreted or
disregarded by medical staff (40).
ECG AS A SCREENING TOOL FOR SCD RISK
PREDICTION
The addition of a resting 12-lead ECG to a screening
history and physical examination increases the sensitivity to
identify many of the cardiac conditions associated with
SCD, specifically cardiomyopathies, myocarditis, ion-
channel disorders, and ventricular pre-excitation (41).
Nonetheless, 2 important causes of SCD in young athletes,
anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery and aortic root
dilation, are not detected by ECG (26,42). Just as
importantly, physician-to-physician variability in interpret-
ing the ECG in elite athletes can be considerable (43,44).
Although there is increasing momentum to standardize
ECG interpretation in elite athletes (45,46), the acceptance
of such standardization, the dissemination of an agreed-
upon knowledge base for such standardization, and the
infrastructure to support such an approach are widely
variable across the United States in general, and across
NCAA member institutions in particular. This alone may
have an effect on both the capacity and ability to implement
any type of effective screening for SCD. Therefore, if ECG
is included in the cardiovascular screening of athletes, it
should be:
1. Disclosed that the ECG has limits for positive and negative
predictive accuracy for SCD risk.
2. Interpreted with the current (and future evolving) state of
knowledge that distinguishes physiological cardiac remod-
eling from findings suggestive of underlying cardiac
pathology.
3. Conducted with adequate cardiology oversight and re-
sources to assist with the secondary investigation of ECG
abnormalities. The ECG should be obtained with equip-
ment and by persons trained according to ACC/AHA/Heart
Rhythm Society recommendations (2).

 4. Paralleled by the development of a registry for research
into new knowledge regarding sensitivity and specificity of
history, physical examination, and ECG findings to the
screening process.
Data suggests that screening by history and physical
examination alone has a low sensitivity to detect conditions
associated with SCD (33), and that the addition of ECG,
when properly interpreted and with skilled cardiology
resources available, improves cardiovascular screening if
the measurable endpoint is considered the detection of
silent or congenital cardiac conditions associated with SCD
(46) (see Table 4 for preliminary findings from an NCAA-
funded research study addressing the feasibility of ECG
screening). Although the AHA does not support a
mandatory, nationalized ECG screening program for
athletes, it has long supported, in principle, ECG screening
programs that are well-designed, prudently implemented,
and include adequate cardiology resources and expertise
(10,26,28). Even though the addition of an ECG may
improve the sensitivity of detecting potentially fatal
cardiovascular abnormalities, it may increase false-positive
results, particularly if updated ECG screening criteria are
not utilized (47,48). The false-positive rate can be reduced
from 17% to 4.2% without affecting sensitivity when
updated ECG screening criteria are used (47). Nevertheless,
the observation that 0.25% of screened athletes have
potentially dangerous cardiac conditions (49), and yet the
number of deaths among NCAA athletes both in and out of
competition has averaged 7.9 deaths/year over the past
decade (17), suggests that ECG screening may detect
cardiac conditions that would not lead to adverse events.
The possibility that these individuals could receive
apparently appropriate, but ultimately unnecessary inter-
ventions concerns some experts. There is an additional
concern that ECGs routinely read in clinical practice, not by
trained clinicians, are interpreted by ECG machine
computer algorithms, which may increase the false positive
rate. However, the long-term implications of whether early
detection truly saves lives or, perhaps, causes harm through
adverse medical events from secondary cardiac testing or
procedures require additional study.
Furthermore, the potential gap between those member
schools that offer ECG and/or echocardiogram screening
and those that do not represents not only a philosophical/
medical variation, but also a potential difference in
infrastructure support and available expertise. This presents
a further limitation to understanding if broader ECG
screening across NCAA member institutions will achieve
the desired goal of preventing SCD in student-athletes.
Clarification of these uncertainties, in light of the current
data cited previously, would come from a ‘‘big data’’
initiative that includes a large registry of ECG data and
outcomes, such as recommended by the Institute of
Medicine (IOM) for cardiac arrest generally (50), and
new research funding strategies focused on such issues
(51).
REGIONAL REFERRAL CENTERS FOR EVALUATION
OF ATHLETES SUSPECTED OR KNOWN TO HAVE A
CARDIOVASCULAR PROBLEM
Cardiovascular issues associated with SCD can be
addressed in a cardiovascular center with or without a
formal sports cardiology program. Sports cardiology is a
highly specialized segment of cardiovascular medicine
that has achieved recognition by major cardiovascular
organizations, such as the ACC. However, relatively few
individual practitioners or institutions have embraced the
knowledge base, practice skills, and experience applica-
ble to this discipline. This limitation is magnified for the
circumstances of college athletics by the geographic and
population dispersion of colleges and universities with
athletic programs. Certainly, most colleges and univer-
sities in major metropolitan areas, universitybased
medical centers, and many major community medical
centers have access to the expertise needed to evaluate
athletes who are determined by screening programs to
require further evaluation or who develop symptoms
potentially due to cardiovascular problems during
Table 4. ECG Screening in NCAA Athletes: Key Preliminary Findings From a 2-Year Multicenter Feasibility Trial
Abnormal ECGs were present in 192 (3.7%) of athletes.
A total of 1,716 athletes (33%) reported at least 1 positive response from the AHA symptom and family history questions, demonstrating the
importance of clinician input in evaluating the questionnaire response.
Thirteen conditions (0.23% of all athletes) associated with SCD or severe cardiac morbidity were identified, including:
� Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (n ¼ 15)
� Large atrial septal defect with right ventricle dilation requiring surgery (n ¼ 5)
� Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n ¼ 5)
All 13 had abnormal ECGs, and 3 had an abnormal history or physical examination.
The respective false-positive rates for detecting a potentially dangerous cardiac condition by ECG, physical examination, and reported history
responses were 3.4%, 2%, and 33%.
Of the abnormal ECGs, 1 in 16 (positive predictive value 6.3%) represented a potentially serious cardiac condition, whereas 1 in 1,000 (positive
predictive value 0.1%) positive history responses led to detection of a serious cardiac condition.
The average time loss from sport for athletes with an abnormal ECG was 2.6 days.
The average cost of follow-up testing for the 192 student-athletes with abnormal ECGs was not assessed.
No student-athlete had an adverse medical complication from additional cardiac testing or was unnecessarily disqualified from sport.
From an NCAA-funded research study addressing the feasibility of ECG screening (Drezner [49]). The NCAA funded a 2-year, multicenter,
prospective study on ECG screening in college student-athletes. Thirty-five NCAA institutions participated, and .5,200 student-athletes
underwent cardiovascular screening with ECG and the AHA-recommended history and physical examination. Electrocardiograms were
interpreted at a single institution by cardiologists with experience in ECG interpretation in athletes. The ‘‘Seattle Criteria’’ for ECG
interpretation were utilized by the cardiologists to determine abnormal findings (4S). The host institution’s medical team determined
evaluation of ECG abnormalities, management of detected cardiac conditions, and all eligibility decisions.

 training or competition. Many of the smaller colleges and
universities in low-density population areas do not have
local access to such expertise. Accordingly, it is rational
to consider developing regional referral centers to serve
these functions. Their functions should include, but not
be limited to:
1. Providing electronically accessible consultative resources
for pre-participation ECG interpretation when local
expertise for this specialized skill is not available.
2. Clarifying the cardiovascular status of athletes found to have a
suspicious personal history, family history, physical exami-
nation, or ECG during routine pre-participation screening.
3. Evaluating new symptoms developing during training or
competition, or in association with intercurrent illness, at
any time.
4. Consulting regarding clearance to participate or limitations
on levels of intensity for training and competition by
athletes with identified inherited, developmental, or
acquired disorders, or to return to training or competition
after resolution of an acquired cardiovascular problem,
such as myocarditis.
Cardiovascular centers, as described, should be guided by
specific standards for personnel, accessibility, and resourc-
es. In addition, both cardiology centers and institutions/
individuals with the knowledge base, practice skills, and
experience to evaluate and make recommendations for
athletes with cardiac conditions should strive to follow
consensus recommendations and guidelines principally
addressing criteria for eligibility and disqualification from
organized competitive sports for the purpose of ensuring
the health and safety of athletes (23,52–60).
RECOGNITION OF AND RESPONSE TO CARDIAC
ARREST
Cardiac arrest is defined as a severe malfunction or
cessation of the electrical and mechanical activity of the
heart, and results in almost instantaneous loss of con-
sciousness and collapse (50). Cardiac arrest in athletes can
be effectively treated through prompt recognition, early
CPR, and early use of an AED. A written EAP for treatment
of cardiac arrest that is well rehearsed will help to ensure an
efficient and structured response to an athlete with a cardiac
emergency who has collapsed, is not breathing normally or
is only gasping (i.e., agonal respirations), and who is
unresponsive. Essential elements of such an EAP include
(61,62):
1. Training of anticipated responders in CPR and AED use
(e.g., other athletes, coaching staff, referees, and so forth).
2. Establishing an effective emergency communication sys-
tem.
3. Ensuring quick access to early defibrillation from collapse
to first shock.
4. Ensuring that on-site AEDs are properly charged and
functioning.
5. Integrating on-site responder and AED programs with the
local EMS system.
6. Practicing and reviewing the emergency response plan at
least annually.
Prompt recognition of cardiac arrest is the first step to an
efficient emergency response (50,62). Although many
cases of athlete collapse are transient and are from benign
causes, cardiac arrest should be assumed in any student-
athlete who has collapsed, is not breathing normally or
only gasping, and is unresponsive, and the EAP for cardiac
arrest should be activated. Gasping and agonal respirations
can occur in the first minutes after cardiac arrest and
should not be interpreted as normal breathing. Brief
seizure-like activity or involuntary arm and leg move-
ments occur in approximately 50% of individuals with
cardiac arrest (63,64). Therefore, cardiac arrest should not
be mistaken for a seizure or syncope. In young athletes
(,35 years of age), the most common causes of SCD are
related to the following cardiovascular conditions: hyper-
trophic cardiomyopathy, congenital coronary anomalies,
arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, com-
motio cordis, and ion channelopathies (65). Survival from
cardiac arrest declines 7% to 10% for every minute that
defibrillation is delayed (66). Cardiac arrest in student-
athletes is a more survivable event through prompt
recognition and treatment with CPR and an AED, with
survival rates as high as 89% (63,67).
It is not sufficient to have in place a general protocol for
treatment of cardiac arrest. Protocols must be situation-
specific (61). For example, treatment of cardiac arrest in the
basketball gymnasium during a routine practice will differ
from treatment in the same gymnasium during a sold-out
basketball game that results in traffic delays and access
problems. Thus, coordination with EMS must be done
beforehand, both to cover practice-related and game/
championship events. Planning for emergency access by
EMS must be an essential element of planning for all
competition/championship events.
Whenever an athlete collapses and appears unresponsive,
first responders should (68):
1. Make sure the scene is safe.
2. Tap and shout at the unresponsive individual. If there is no
breathing or only gasping, and if there is no definite pulse
felt within 10 s, then:
3. Call for help and activate the local EMS system (i.e., call
911 or local emergency services number). Access points
for EMS to enter and exit the stadium, facility, or other
venue should be made clear to EMS and the facilities
manager and should be easily accessible for unimpeded
entry and exit.
4. If an AED is known to be in the immediate vicinity,
retrieve and apply the AED as soon as possible, and apply
shock if there is a shockable rhythm. Then, follow the AED
prompts regarding CPR and further shocks.
5. If an AED is not immediately available, begin chest
compressions/CPR until an AED arrives.
The debate about the effectiveness of various screening
examinations and tools to prevent SCD in student-athletes
will undoubtedly continue. However, there is no debate that
a well-rehearsed and effectively implemented EAP for
treatment of cardiac arrest is effective at reducing the risk
of death.
CARDIAC RESEARCH INITIATIVES
The NCAA is committed to expanding the understanding
of SCD and advancing the cardiovascular care of athletes
through education, research, and creation of new resources.
352
Volume 51 � Number 4 � April 2016
 With the enactment of NCAA legislation that mandates
catastrophic injury reporting (69), NCAA member institu-
tions are required to report all catastrophic injuries
occurring in student-athletes (including events that occur
outside of athletic training and competition); sudden death
and near fatalities from cardiac arrest are counted as
catastrophic injuries. Although SCD event reporting is
mandatory for NCAA athletes, collecting information on
sudden cardiac events for all college-aged and younger
individuals would be informative for a greater understand-
ing of incidence and prevention. Thus, future research on
the incidence of life-threatening cardiovascular events in
NCAA student-athletes will be directed by more precise
data.
More accurate information is also needed on the specific
etiologies of SCD in college student-athletes. After the
sudden death of any athlete, there is an opportunity to
perform a comprehensive and expert forensic examination.
This includes gross anatomical autopsy by a cardiovascular
pathologist experienced in the distinction of athletic heart
changes from structural pathologies associated with SCD.
In the case of a negative or indeterminate autopsy, genetic
testing can be conducted for known pathogenic gene
mutations associated with ion-channel disorders, cardio-
myopathies, and other established causes of SCD in young
persons. The NCAA has pledged to fund a study in which
expert forensic examination and genetic testing will be
available in cases of SCD. This means that post-mortem
tissue samples will be preserved to protect the quality of
extracted deoxyribonucleic acid, and heart tissue will be
preserved in accordance with methods that permit expert
cardiac pathology examination that can identify specific
cardiac conditions associated with SCD.
Additional research is needed to improve cardiovascular
screening strategies. The standardization of personal and
family history questions requires additional study to
determine both accuracy and efficacy. In addition, the
feasibility, cost implications, and downstream diagnostic
testing yield of different screening strategies needs to be
assessed, including those confined to history and physical
examination versus those that also utilize testing, such as
ECG and echocardiogram. Industry partnerships can be
explored that may make more accurate and consistent ECG
interpretation more widely available. Research can extend
above and beyond pre-participation cardiovascular disease
screening to include the effect of early-life choices and
habits on cardiovascular disease risk throughout the
lifespan. Lifestyle issues related to tobacco, dietary
patterns, physical activity, and medical conditions (such
as hypertension, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and
key cardiovascular adaptations to sport) are incompletely
understood among NCAA student-athletes, both during
college and later in life. Future research dedicated to
understanding the scope and long-term clinical implications
of these issues is important.
The NCAA is committed to partnering with national
organizations dedicated to the continued education of
primary care, sports medicine, and cardiology physicians
to enhance the cardiovascular care of athletes. Within this
context, the NCAA has an important public health
opportunity to better understand early markers of cardio-
vascular disease that may be present during college. It is
entirely conceivable that precursors or early manifestations

 of cardiovascular disease in college student-athletes may
lead to death on a substantially larger order of magnitude
than SCD. The development of preventive care strategies
and long-term surveillance will help to establish improved
long-term cardiovascular health. In addition, the opportu-
nity to utilize findings in college student-athletes for
application to the ‘‘college-aged’’ population cohort cannot
be understated.
Lastly, the IOM report, ‘‘Strategies to Improve Cardiac
Arrest Survival: A Time to Act’’ (50) provides recommen-
dations that can serve as collaborative opportunities for
NCAA member institutions. Pertinent recommendations
that are applicable across member schools include:
1. Establish a national cardiac arrest registry. The IOM
recommends that the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention should expand and coordinate cardiac arrest
data collection through a publicly reported and available
national cardiac arrest registry. The National Center for
Catastrophic Sport Injury Research can develop collabo-
rative data collection strategies with the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
2. Foster a culture of action through public awareness and
training. The IOM recommends partnerships that promote
public awareness of the signs, symptoms, and treatment of
cardiac arrest, noting that such efforts require public CPR
and AED training. This awareness and training creates a
culture of action that prepares and motivates bystanders to
respond immediately upon witnessing a cardiac arrest.
Member schools may be in a unique position to become a
key component of such a culture of action. Every member
school should have a cardiac emergency response plan
and protocol. Online resources are available from the
AHA (4).
3. Adopt continuous quality improvement programs. The
IOM recommends an integrated health care adoption of
continuous quality improvement programs for cardiac
arrest response. Member schools can become part of such
programs.
4. Accelerate research on pathophysiology, new therapies,
and translation of science for cardiac arrest. The IOM
recommends a collaborative effort to build the nation’s
infrastructure that will support and accelerate innovative
research on the causal mechanisms of onset, pathophysi-
ology, treatment, and outcomes of cardiac arrest. Coordi-
nated data collection at NCAA member schools represents
a unique opportunity to help advance such an effort.
5. Create a National Cardiac Arrest Collaborative. The IOM
recommends the establishment of a National Cardiac
Arrest Collaborative that will unify the cardiac arrest field,
identify common goals, and build momentum within the
field to ultimately improve survival from cardiac arrest
with good neurological and functional outcomes. NCAA
member schools are uniquely positioned to become part of
this collaborative.
CONCLUSIONS
Cardiac arrest during training and sports participation is a
leading cause of unexpected deaths and post-arrest
disabilities in NCAA athletes. The risk of SCD is higher
in male and African-American athletes and appears to be
disproportionately high in men’s basketball players.
Cardiovascular screening in athletes should include a
standardized personal and family history and a physical
examination. ECG screening can increase the sensitivity to
detect potentially lethal cardiac conditions if physician
training is improved and cardiology expertise is available.
If ECG screening is used ECGs should be interpreted with
modern standards that distinguish physiological changes
from findings associated with pathological cardiac disor-
ders. Secondary testing of screening abnormalities and
management of identified cardiac disorders should be
carried out in consultation with skilled cardiovascular
specialists. All NCAA member institutions should have an
established EAP to respond to an athlete with a cardiac
emergency who has collapsed, is not breathing normally or
only gasping, and is unresponsive, including the availability
of AEDs at all sporting facilities. Although NCAA member
institutions report all SCD events in student-athletes,
collecting information on sudden cardiac events for all
college-aged and younger individuals would be informative
for greater understanding of incidence and prevention.
Together NCAA member institutions have an opportunity
to train coaching staff, referees, and student-athletes to
recognize and respond to a cardiac emergency on the field
and in the community and to become CPR ambassadors
between the athletic programs and the larger student
population. Management of cardiac arrest with prompt
recognition, early activation of the emergency response
system, early CPR, and early use of an AED provides the
best chance of survival (Central Illustration).
