T cells become activated when T-cell receptors (TCRs) recognize
agonist peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex
molecules on antigen-presenting cells. T-cell activation critically
relies on the spatiotemporal arrangements of TCRs on the plasma
membrane. However, the molecular organizations of TCRs on
lymph node-resident T cells have not yet been determined, owing to
the diffraction limit of light. Here we visualized nanometer- and
micrometer-scale TCR distributions in lymph nodes by light sheet
direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM)
and structured illumination microscopy (SIM). This dSTORM and
SIM approach provides the first evidence, to our knowledge, of
multiscale reorganization of TCRs during in vivo immune responses.
We observed nanometer-scale plasma membrane domains, known
as protein islands, on naïve T cells. These protein islands were enriched
within micrometer-sized surface areas that we call territories. In
vivo T-cell activation caused the TCR territories to contract, leading
to the coalescence of protein islands and formation of stable
TCR microclusters.

T
cells play a central role in adaptive immunity against pathogens.
T-cell receptors (TCRs) in the plasma membrane recognize
pathogen-derived peptides bound to major histocompatibility
complexes (MHCs) on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs).
The compartmentalization and distribution of TCRs reflect early
signaling events (1, 2). TCR microcluster formation has been ob-
served on artificial surfaces coated with antibodies against TCR
or endogenous ligands, and on glass-supported lipid bilayers con-
taining ligands. The microtubule-dependent inward movement of
microclusters forms a mature immunologic synapse with its typical
“bull’s eye” pattern (3–5).
New superresolution imaging techniques have extended the
study of membrane architecture to the nanometer scale; these
techniques include photoactivated localization microscopy [PALM
(6) or FPALM (7)], (direct) stochastic optical reconstruction mi-
croscopy [STORM (8) or dSTORM (9)], and structured illumination
microscopy [SIM (10, 11)]. In combination with electron microscopy
(EM), these techniques have revealed 70- to 200-nm-wide TCR
membrane domains on quiescent T cells (12–14), known as “pro-
tein islands” or “nanoclusters.” These protein islands coalesce into
micrometer-scale clusters, or “microclusters,” after T-cell activation
(13). Although many other membrane proteins form similar
nanometer-sized compartments, including lipid-anchored proteins
(15–17), integrins (18, 19), immune receptors (13, 14, 20, 21), growth
factor receptors (22) and neurotransmitter receptors (23, 24), these
have not been observed in tissue. In particular, nanometer-scale TCR
organization and rearrangement after antigen recognition have not
been observed in the physiological environment of T cells. As such,
the physiological relevance of TCR clustering remains in question.
We investigated the subdiffraction organization of TCRs in
mouse lymph nodes and its change in response to antigen ex-
posure using light-sheet dSTORM and SIM. dSTORM provides
higher spatial resolution than SIM, whereas SIM circumvents the
spurious clustering artifacts in dSTORM. Comparison of lymph
node sections from untreated and antigen-challenged mice revealed
redistributions of TCR islands induced by antigenic peptides
processed and presented by APCs in vivo. Our results demon-
strate that T-cell activation is spatially controlled at nanometer
and micrometer scales, ranging from protein islands to micro-
clusters and newly described “territories.”
Results
Light Sheet dSTORM Visualized Nanometer-Scale TCR Islands on Naïve
Lymph Node-Resident T Cells. We developed prism-coupled light
sheet dSTORM to overcome the high fluorescence background
from bulk excitation in tissue (25). In brief, spatially aligned
642-nm and 405-nm lasers pass through a cylindrical lens and
focus at the back aperture of a long-working distance illumination
objective. The light sheet traverses through a glass prism and focuses
at the interface between glass and tissue. Use of the glass prism in-
creases the sample space to accommodate the use of a standard
35-mm culture dish (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 A–C). The ∼2-μm-thin
light sheet is coplanar with the image plane. Optical sectioning is
achieved by adjusting the position of the tissue sample in relation
to the light sheet (SI Appendix, Fig. S1D).
For dSTORM imaging in the present study, a continuous 642-nm
excitation light sheet was overlaid with a low-power 405-nm ac-
tivation light sheet with various pulse durations. A sparse set of
single molecule events was activated in each frame. Individual
molecule localizations were determined by Gaussian-based cen-
troid fitting using a custom MATLAB code. Drift correction was
performed by subpixel cross-correlation (26–28), which achieved a
level of precision comparable to that seen with the use of fiducial
markers (SI Appendix, Figs. S2 and S3). The localization precision
Significance
T-cell receptors (TCRs) recognize pathogens during T-cell–mediated
adaptive immune responses. Here we directly observed the orga-
nization of TCRs and their rearrangement on lymph node-resident
T cells during an immune response. We found that TCRs were
preclustered into nanometer-scale protein islands, which were
organized into larger membrane territories, and that T-cell
activation induced the formation of microclusters. Our data
provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, of subdiffraction
membrane organizations during immune responses in an ani-
mal model system.

 in lymph nodes was 35 ± 9 nm, with an average photon count of
∼400. The lateral resolution within the image plane was estimated
as ∼50 nm (SI Appendix, Fig. S4).
The TCR distribution on naïve T cells was investigated in lymph
nodes from 5c.c7 TCR transgenic mice without antigen exposure.
CD4 T cells from 5c.c7 TCR transgenic mice recognize a peptide
derived from moth cytochrome c (MCC; amino acids 88–103)
presented by MHC class II molecules (specifically I-Ek) (29). Lymph
nodes were fixed immediately after removal and cryosectioned for
immunofluorescence staining. TCRs were detected with a mono-
clonal antibody (H57) against the β-chain directly conjugated with
Alexa Fluor 647 dye (H57AF647). In a typical lymph node section,
T cells surrounded B-cell follicles near the periphery of the tissue. In
the T-cell zone, confocal imaging showed diffraction-limited distri-
butions of TCRs at the plasma membrane (SI Appendix, Fig. S5).
dSTORM imaging revealed nanometer-scale TCR islands on
naïve lymph node-resident T cells (Fig. 1A). The simultaneous
detection of the cell surfaces and cross-sections indicates specific
staining at the plasma membrane of T cells. We tested whether
TCR island and single H57AF647 antibody signals can be distin-
guished by comparing TIRF-based dSTORM images of isolated
naïve T cells and single H57AF647 antibodies on glass surfaces.
Circles with a diameter 2.5 times the localization accuracy,
δ (87.5 nm), highlight detection events produced by single anti-
bodies. In contrast to antibodies detected on the glass surface,
TCRs in the plasma membrane of 5c.c7 T cells showed organized
distributions (Fig. 1B). Based on the number of localization events,
a small fraction of TCRs on the T-cell surfaces were detected as
spatially isolated molecules. Here we defined TCR islands as as-
semblies of TCRs separated by less than 2.5 times the localization
accuracy (overlapping circles in Fig. 1B). The majority of protein
islands displayed larger dimensions, asymmetric shapes, and greater
numbers of events (Fig. 1 B and C).
Antibodies are known to have low labeling efficiency (30). Here
immunostaining of lymph node sections resulted in the binding of
2.5 H57AF647 antibodies per TCR island on average. We cal-
culated the detection efficiency to determine the number of total
(labeled and unlabeled) TCRs per island. In the plasma mem-
brane of naïve T cells, we registered ∼40 H57AF647 per μm2.
According to the previously reported surface concentrations of
∼140 TCRs per μm2 (2, 13), we estimated our detection effi-
ciency to be ∼30%. Based on this efficiency, the calculated
number of TCRs per island is consistent with literature values of
7–20 (Fig. 1C) (13). In addition, the island structures in tissue are
similar to those found in previous in vitro studies, which reported
40- to 300-nm-wide TCR islands with distances of 130–260 nm
between them (13, 16).
TCR islands were enriched within 0.5- to 2-μm-wide membrane
regions, which we call “territories.” Within a territory, neighboring
islands were distinct and separated by ∼200 nm (SI Appendix, Fig.
S6). Territories have irregular and undefined shapes, and are
surrounded by membrane regions with low or no detectable levels
of TCRs.
Light Sheet dSTORM Revealed TCR Microclusters After in Vivo T-Cell
Activation. We next investigated changes to TCR organization
after in vivo T-cell activation. Previous in vitro studies have
shown concatenation of TCR islands into microclusters after
antigen recognition on activating surfaces (13, 14). Here we
studied additional physiological parameters, including the dis-
play of endogenous and antigenic peptides at physiological
concentrations by host APCs, processing and transport of anti-
genic peptides, and mechanical and biochemical environments in
the lymph node.
For T-cell activation, 5c.c7 TCR transgenic mice were injected i.
p. with MCC peptides in alum adjuvant. Dendritic cells (DCs) ei-
ther from the injection site or resident to the draining lymph nodes
presented the MCC peptides and induced specific T-cell responses
(SI Appendix, Fig. S7A). Mesenteric lymph nodes were immediately
fixed and imaged at 2, 5, and 24 h after injection. The presence of
MCC in the lymph node as early as 2 h postinjection (SI Appendix,
Fig. S7B) indicates T-cell activation by DCs. Previous studies have
shown that peptide injection causes rapid and synchronized acti-
vation of all T cells in TCR transgenic systems (31). Compared with
T cells from untreated mice, T cells from injected mice showed
increased heterogeneity in shape, size, and membrane roughness
(Fig. 2A and SI Appendix, Fig. S7C).
In contrast to naïve T cells, a subset of TCRs in activated
T cells was localized in 200- to 800-nm-wide structures (Fig. 2B).
These structures are similar to the aforementioned microclusters
(1, 32, 33). Unlike territories, protein islands could not be re-
solved within microclusters (Fig. 2B). Local fluorescence density
peaks in superresolution images indicated reduced separation
between protein islands (Fig. 2C). Microclusters could be formed

 through concatenation of territories and recruitment of addi-
tional protein islands. Naïve T cells contain only TCR territories,
whereas activated T cells contain both territories and micro-
clusters, suggesting that not all TCRs contribute to T-cell
activation. Control injections of alum adjuvant without MCC
peptide did not trigger TCR redistributions (SI Appendix, Fig.
S8). Therefore, the observed TCR rearrangements are caused by
the recognition of MCC peptide presented by MHC molecules
on DCs. The locations of microclusters most likely coincide with
the initial contact sites between T cells and DCs.
We confirmed the observed TCR organizations on freshly
isolated T cells from mice before and after peptide injection
using a TIRF-based dSTORM system with greater localization
accuracy. Immunostaining was performed in T-cell suspension
without membrane permeabilization, and T cells were spun onto
glass slides for imaging. This procedure stains plasma mem-
brane TCRs, but not the TCRs residing on extracellular micro-
vesicles or intracellular membranes (e.g., endosomes, Golgi,
endoplasmic reticulum). TIRF dSTORM resolved protein is-
lands on naïve T cells and concatenating protein islands within
microclusters on activated T cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S9).
The interprotein–island separation distances appeared to be
slightly increased compared with tissue. Tissue dissociation also
yielded more homogeneous appearance and distributions of
microclusters. The flattening of the plasma membrane could
contribute to these differences. Costaining of T cells with a
membrane dye (DiL) and H57AF647 verified that increased TCR
localization was not due to membrane ruffling (SI Appendix,
Fig. S10).
SIM Imaging of TCR Islands and Microclusters in Lymph Node-
Resident T Cells. We confirmed our light sheet dSTORM findings
using SIM. On naïve lymph node-resident T cells, SIM detected
segregated TCR islands with dimensions of ∼100–300 nm (Fig. 3
A–C). These islands are resolution-limited assemblies of TCRs,
because SIM has a lower resolution than dSTORM (>100 nm in
tissue). Each assembly entity could represent a single TCR island
or multiple TCR islands. The interassembly separation distances
were 200–500 nm. After in vivo activation, T cells showed clear
changes in TCR distributions (Fig. 3 D–F). Decreased interassembly
distances suggested closer packing of the protein islands. T cells with
increased TCR clustering appeared more polarized, which could be
mediated by T cell–APC contacts. These findings support the earlier
light sheet dSTORM data from lymph nodes. In addition, SIM im-
aging of T cells freshly isolated from mice before and after peptide
injection confirmed the TCR organizations observed in lymph
node-resident T cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S9).

 Discussion
The complex organization and dynamics of the plasma mem-
brane present an ongoing challenge. This study is the first, to our
knowledge, to image plasma membrane receptors in the native
tissue environment with subdiffraction resolution using dSTORM
and SIM. For dSTORM, we achieved a high signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) by using ultrathin light sheet illumination. Our data prove
the existence of nanometer- and micrometer-sized TCR mem-
brane structures on lymph node-resident T cells. TCR islands on
naïve T cells were enriched in surface areas that we call territories.
On in vivo activation, T cells formed TCR microclusters with broad
size distributions. The coexistence of microclusters and territories
on activated T cells suggest that TCR redistribution is restricted
to T cell–APC contact sites. Our observations suggest a hi-
erarchical organization of TCRs on the plasma membrane of
lymph node-resident T cells (Fig. 4). In naïve T cells, TCRs are
preclustered into nanometer-scale protein islands, which are
enriched in micrometer-scale territories. After antigen recogni-
tion, TCR territories contract to form microclusters. Territory
contraction brings together distinct protein islands, which are re-
quired for signal transduction and T-cell activation.
Potential limitations of the present study include artifacts due
to postexcision fixation, low labeling efficiencies, and reduced
resolution. These limitations require the consideration of alter-
native procedures and interpretations. Postexcision fixation of
lymph nodes by immersion could affect T-cell morphology and
plasma membrane organizations. For optimal results, it should
be replaced in future studies by perfusion fixation (34). The
low labeling efficiency of immunofluorescence staining (∼30%)
hinders quantitative analysis of the dimensions of TCR islands
and microclusters. Some localization clusters in naïve T cells
could represent monomers or islands within which only one TCR
was detected. TCR transgenic mice with T cells expressing TCRs
fused to photoactivatable fluorescent proteins could be used to
increase the detection efficiency. In addition, the resolution
achieved here does not allow us to distinguish between TCRs at
the plasma membrane and in intracellular or extracellular vesi-
cles close to the cell surface (35, 36). Although our data from
freshly isolated lymph node T cells with and without peptide
injections showed similar changes to the data from tissue sections,
contributions from vesicles cannot be excluded. TCRs are con-
tinuously recycled by endocytosis and exocytosis (36–41). TCR
down-regulation by endocytosis is a well-documented mechanism
to reduce T-cell signaling (37–41). More recently, secretion of
exosomes in the immunologic synapse has been reported for T
cells activated on glass-supported lipid bilayers (36). Taken to-
gether, these processes can contribute to the TCR enrichment that
we observed in lymph node-resident T cells.
Traditional central supramolecular activation clusters (cSMACs),
a hallmark of mature synapses, were not apparent on lymph
node-resident T cells. This observation is consistent with multifocal

 TCR structures observed by EM (42), transient TCR accumu-
lations in vivo (35), and subregions identified within the cSMAC
(33, 43, 44). The stable microclusters described here may resemble
these previously described structures and could share some of
their functions, such as signal maintenance, signal inhibition,
endocytosis, and exocytosis. The sustained presence of micro-
clusters in our study suggests that the plasma membrane re-
tains its TCR reorganization beyond initial T cell–APC contacts
(45). Based on in vitro studies, TCR clustering is most likely
maintained by cytoskeletal structures and lipid phase separation
(1, 2).
TCR territories provide a mechanism for microcluster for-
mation. TCR-enriched territories are likely responsible for the
fast and amplified assembly of the signaling cascade, making
them surface “hot spots” for APC recognition. Previous studies
have shown that T cells can recognize a single agonist peptide
and become fully activated by ∼10 peptides (46, 47). Our present
data and previous data suggest that recognition of a single ago-
nist peptide within a protein island can lead to contraction of the
corresponding territory into a microcluster. It is likely that TCR
interactions with endogenous peptide-MHC complexes on the
APC contribute to this mechanism, to ensure sufficient cell con-
tact and TCR recruitment (48). A territory would serve as the
smallest activation unit to simultaneously ensure antigen speci-
ficity and sensitivity.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have investigated the organization and rearrange-
ment of TCRs on lymph node-resident T cells before and after in vivo
activation. We achieved subdiffraction resolution and resolved TCR
protein islands and territories on naïve T cells. In mice injected with
agonist peptides, we observed the formation of microclusters. We
have summarized our findings in a model that considers TCR orga-
nization on nanometer and micrometer scales. Our study provides
multiple lines of evidence for the spatial organizations of TCRs
in vivo. Our imaging approach is an important step toward studying
many biological systems in which the cellular architecture con-
trols their physiological functions at nanometer scale.
Materials and Methods
Mice, Antibodies, Peptides, and Fluorophores. 5c.c7/Rag2−/− (Taconic) and B10.A
mice (Taconic) were crossed to obtain homozygous 5c.c7 TCR transgenic mice.
The animal protocol was approved by the Salk Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee (protocol #13-00006). Armenian hamster monoclonal anti-
body H57 anti-murine TCR β-chain (Bio-X-Cell) was used to label TCRs. In-
traperitoneal injection of MCC peptides was used for in vivo activation of
T cells. Mesenteric lymph nodes were removed from mice, cryosectioned,
and labeled with H57 conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 (SI Appendix, Ma-
terials and Methods).
Superresolution Fluorescence Imaging.
Light Sheet dSTORM. Single-molecule superresolution imaging was performed
using a prism-coupled light sheet system as described previously (25). Single
molecule events within 2.5 times the localization precision (35 nm) from
consecutive frames were grouped into a single localization event. Drift
correction was performed using subpixel cross-correlation (SI Appendix,
Materials and Methods).
TIRF dSTORM. The same excitation and activation lasers as used for light sheet
dSTORM were used for TIRF illumination on an inverted Nikon Eclipse mi-
croscope. Drift correction was performed using near-infrared gold nanoshells
as fiducials (SI Appendix, Materials and Methods).
SIM. The Zeiss ELYRA PS.1 system was used for SIM imaging. Tissue samples
were embedded in Vectashield for index matching (SI Appendix, Materials
and Methods).
Analysis. Superresolution images were reconstructed by an in-house MATLAB
code that performs Gaussian fit to single molecule images in both lateral and
horizontal directions. Drift correction using subpixel cross-correlation was
performed using a MATLAB code adapted from Guizar-Sicairos et al. (49).
Fourier ring correlation analysis was performed using a MATLAB code
adapted from Nieuwenhuizen et al. (50).
