Abstract
Objective To investigate the efficacy of topical 0.2% hyaluronic acid in canine corneal
ulcers in vivo.
Procedures Six purpose-bred beagles were randomly assigned into two groups (three
dogs/group): group A received experimental product (Optimend
TM, containing 0.2%
hyaluronic acid, KineticVet
TM); group B received control product (Optimend
TM with-
out 0.2% hyaluronic acid and supplemented with carboxymethylcellulose). The clinical
scorer was masked to product content and subject assignment. Under sedation and
topical anesthesia, 6-mm axial corneal epithelial debridements were performed in the
left eye. Wounded corneas received standard ulcer treatment and topical product
(group A) or control product (group B) three times a day (TID) until ulcers were
healed. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy was performed 6 h after wounding and then every
12 h; findings were graded according to modified McDonald–Shadduck scoring sys-
tem; extraocular photography was performed after fluorescein stain application at all
examination time points. Images were analyzed using NIH IMAGE J software to quan-
tify rate of corneal epithelialization. Gelatin zymography was used to analyze matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 and 9 protein expression in tears collected at set time
points during the study period.
Results No statistical differences in clinical ophthalmic examination scores, rate of cor-
neal epithelialization, or MMP2 or MMP9 protein expression were found between
groups at any tested time point.
Conclusions The application of 0.2% hyaluronic acid to standard ulcer medical man-
agement is well tolerated. Topical addition of the viscoelastic did not accelerate cor-
neal wound healing compared to a topical control with similar viscosity in this study.

INTRODUCTION
Corneal epithelial injuries are common in both physician
and veterinary ophthalmology. Causes of superficial cor-
neal ulceration include trauma, spontaneous chronic cor-
neal epithelial defects (SCCEDs), aberrant hairs, such as
distichia or ectopic cilia, select surgical procedures (e.g.,
burr
keratotomy),
and
keratoconjunctivitis
sicca.1,2
Regardless of the etiology, corneal epithelial defects heal
primarily by epithelial cell migration and mitosis. This
cellular proliferation and migration is orchestrated by
numerous extracellular molecules, their receptors, and
subsequent intracellular signaling cascades. Hyaluronic
acid has been shown to play a role in corneal wound
healing.3,4
Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharide of the repeating
disaccharide units b-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl glu-
cosamine which are joined by b-1, 3- and b-1, 4-glycosidic
alternating bonds. Hyaluronic acid is abundant in almost
all mammalian tissue and was first discovered in bovine
vitreous.5 Although most naturally occurring hyaluronic
acid is found in connective tissue, it is also found in
epithelial and neural tissue. Hyaluronic acid may exist in
extracellular, pericellular, or intracellular spaces, and at
physiologic pH, hyaluronic acid is a polyanion; therefore,

 hyaluronic acid is hyaluronan.5–7 Previous studies have
localized hyaluronan in the intact rabbit, rat, and canine
cornea and detected this polysaccharide within the inter-
cellular spaces of the epithelium and stroma, within stro-
mal
keratocytes,
and
on
the
apical
surface
of
the
endothelium.8–10
Despite its simple chemical structure, hyaluronic acid
possesses unique rheological properties, specifically non-
Newtonian or shear thinning behavior.11 As a non-Newto-
nian fluid, hyaluronic acid is able to exhibit a low viscosity
when exposed to high shear stress and yet regain a high
viscosity
once
the
shear
stress
is
reduced,
allowing
hyaluronan to contribute to the structural and physiologic
characteristics of the various tissues in which it naturally
resides.
Hyaluronic acid serves other important biologic roles,
including the ability to promote wound healing. Numer-
ous
studies
have
demonstrated
that
hyaluronic
acid
accelerates
corneal wound healing both in vitro and
in
vivo.12–15
Consequently,
topical
hyaluronic
acid
is
commonly included in the treatment regimen for super-
ficial corneal ulcerations in canine patients. However,
past studies have utilized cell culture or small laboratory
animals as test subjects and of significance, phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) as control treatment. While PBS
lacks hyaluronic acid, it also lacks the viscoelastic prop-
erties of hyaluronic acid-containing solutions, a factor
which may be contributing to corneal wound healing in
addition to any innate hyaluronic acid properties. There-
fore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether
a commercially available ophthalmic solution containing
0.2% hyaluronic acid would accelerate canine corneal
wound healing in vivo compared to a control treatment
with similar viscosity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Six healthy female Beagle dogs (9–12 months, 10–15 kg)
were purchased from Covance Laboratory (Cumberland,
VA, USA) and housed in a research facility at the Univer-
sity of Missouri. Prior to study onset, complete oph-
thalmic examination of all dogs was performed by a board
certified veterinary ophthalmologist (EAG). Examinations
included slit-lamp biomicroscopy (SL-15 Kowa Company,
Ltd, Tokyo, Japan), indirect ophthalmoscopy (Wireless
indirect
ophthalmoscope,
Keeler
Instruments
Inc.,
Broomall, PA, USA and pan retinal 2.2 indirect lens; Volk
Optical Inc., Mentor, OH, USA), Schirmer tear test I
(Schering-Plough
Animal
Health,
Union,
NJ,
USA),
tonometry (Tono-Pen Vet, Dan Scott and Associates,
Westerville, OH, USA), and fluorescein staining (Flu-Glo,
Akorn, Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL, USA). All dogs were
determined to be free of ocular disease. The dogs received
daily socialization and all other husbandry needs including
a diurnal 12-h light cycle. All studies were performed
in accordance with the ARVO Statement for the Use of
Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and were
approved by the University of Missouri Institutional Ani-
mal Care and Use Committee.
Topical test products
Both test products were obtained from KineticVet
TM
(KineticVet, Lexington, KY, USA) in containers labeled as
A or B to mask those administering the medications and
the clinical scorer. Product content was not revealed until
study conclusion. Test product A was the experimental
agent, Optimend
TM (KineticVet, Lexington, KY, USA),
which contained 0.2% medium weight hyaluronic acid,
and test product B was the control agent which was Opti-
mend
TM without 0.2% medium weight hyaluronic acid and
supplemented with medium weight carboxymethylcellulose
to achieve the same viscosity as test product A. At the
study’s end point, an independent laboratory (Mass Spec-
trometry Facility, University of Missouri) performed con-
tent analysis of the test products and verified that test
product A contained hyaluronic acid while test product B
did not. Independent analysis of the test products also
revealed that both test products A and B had equal viscosi-
ties of 1150 cps.
Corneal wounding
Corneal wounding was performed by a board certified vet-
erinary ophthalmologist (EAG). Dogs were sedated with
dexmedetomidine (7 mcg/kg, IM; Zoetis Inc., Kalamazoo,
MI, USA) and hydromorphone (0.1 mg/kg, IM; Hospira,
Inc., Lake Forest, IL, USA). Following sterile placement
of
an
intravenous
catheter,
propofol
(Abbott
Animal
Health, Abbott Park, IL, USA, 2–4 mg/kg, IV) was
administered until the dogs were at an appropriate level of
anesthesia for intubation. Intubation was only considered
necessary if apnea occurred, and anesthesia was maintained
with IV administration of propofol to effect. The left eye
was then aseptically prepared, using a 1:20 dilution of
betadine
solution.
Local
anesthetic
(proparacaine
hydrochloride 1%; Bausch & Lomb Inc., Tampa, FL,
USA) was applied to the left eye 3 times to numb the cor-
neal surface. Topical mydriatic and cycloplegic agent (at-
ropine sulfate 1%; Bausch & Lomb Inc., Tampa, FL,
USA) was applied to the left eye once.
A superficial epithelial debridement was performed in
the left eye of all dogs. Briefly, using surgical loupes, a 6-
mm area of the axial cornea was outlined with a corneal
trephine. The epithelium was mechanically removed with
an excimer spatula as previously described.16 Fluorescein
stain was immediately applied to the cornea to verify suc-
cessful removal of the corneal epithelium as demonstrated
in Fig. 1.
Following wounding, the dogs were randomly and
equally assigned to one of two groups (three dogs/group):
group A (experimental agent: Optimend with 0.2% med-
ium weight hyaluronic acid) or group B (control agent:

 Optimend without 0.2% medium weight hyaluronic acid
and supplemented with medium weight carboxymethylcel-
lulose). The left eye of all dogs received standard treat-
ment
for
corneal
ulceration
which
included
topical
antibiotic (bacitracin, polymyxin B, gramicidin ophthalmic
solution, Paddock Laboratories Inc., Minneapolis, MN,
USA, 1 drop OS q 8 hr), and topical mydriatic and cyclo-
plegic (atropine sulfate 1.0%, ophthalmic solution, Akorn
Inc., Lake Forest, IL, USA, 1 drop OS to effect); dogs
were administered systemic anti-inflammatory medication
(carprofen, Zoetis Inc., Kalamazoo, MI, USA, 2.2 mg/kg
PO q 12 hr) and systemic analgesic medication (tramadol,
Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Bridgewater, NJ, USA, 4 mg/kg,
PO q 12 hr); the left eye of the dogs also received either
topical hyaluronic acid or control agent (1 drop OS TID).
To prevent ocular self-trauma, dogs wore an Elizabethan
collar until the study’s end point.
Six hours after wounding and then every 12 h, dogs
underwent examinations by a veterinary ophthalmologist
(EAG) masked to the treatment groups. Ocular health of
the left eye was scored according to the modified McDon-
ald–Shadduck (mMS) scoring system (range: 0–40). Exam-
inations were discontinued once the corneal ulcers were
healed.
Quantification of corneal wound healing
Photography of the left eye was performed at each exami-
nation before and after the application of fluorescein stain
using a Nikon D300S camera and AF-S DX NIKKOR
18–200 mm f/3.5–5.6G ED VR II lens (Nikon Inc., Mel-
ville, NY, USA). Images were analyzed with IMAGE J soft-
ware (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) to determine the rate of
corneal epithelialization. Briefly, the fluorescein stained
cornea was outlined and the area of the ulcer bed was cal-
culated for each examination time point until the ulcer
was healed (i.e., the cornea was fluorescein negative).
These measurements were used to determine the percent
reduction in the area of the corneal ulcer at each time
point. For example, at 6 h postwounding the percent
reduction in the area of the corneal ulcer was calculated as
follows:
½1 � ðArea of ulcer at time 6 hr �
Area of the ulcer at time 0 hrÞ� � 100
(1)
The percent reduction in the area of corneal ulceration
at each time point is demonstrated in Table 1.
Tear collection and extraction for zymography
Tears were collected from the left eye at baseline (i.e.,
prior to wounding) and 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h post-
wounding. Baseline samples served as control. Sampling
performed at baseline and 24, 48, 72, and 96 h post-
wounding occurred between 6 and 7 am to avoid diurnal
changes in tear volume. To collect tears, a Schirmer tear
test strip was placed in the ventral fornix for 1 min. The
tear test strip was then placed in an Eppendorf reaction
tube (Eppendorf-Netheler-Hinz GmbH, Hamburg, Ger-
many) and stored at �80 until further analysis.
Prior to performing zymography, tears were extracted
from tear test strips according to methods previously
described.17 Briefly, 200 lL of extraction buffer (0.5 M
NaCl, Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ, USA and 0.5%
Tween-20, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) was
added to each Eppendorf tube and incubated with gentle
agitation for 3 h at room temperature. The tear test strip
was then transferred to a new 2-mL centrifuge tube, and
residual fluid was extracted by pinching the distal end of
the strip in the sealed cap and centrifuging the tube at
approximately 100 g for 10 s. This liquid was then com-
bined with the stored extraction buffer for that tear test
strip, and the strip was discarded. To determine the total
protein concentration in the tear fluid, absorption was
measured at a wavelength of 595 nm using a nanodrop
plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VA, USA) with Bradford
reagent (Protein Assay Kit, BIO-RAD Laboratories, Her-
cules, CA, USA).
Zymography
Gelatin zymography was used to quantify total isoforms of
MMP2 and MMP9 proteins. 10% Novex precast SDS
polyacrylamide gels (Life Technologies, Novex, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) in the presence of 0.1% gelatin were used
under nonreducing conditions. A 35-lL zymography sam-
ple was prepared with previously harvested protein lysates
(4 lg), Tris–glycine–SDS sample buffer (Life Technolo-
gies, Novex, Carlsbad, CA, USA) (15 lL), and deionized
water (remaining volume). Deionized water was used as a
negative control. Zymography standards of active human
isoforms of MMP2 (molar mass: 66 000) and MMP9 (mo-
lar mass: 67 000) were used as positive standards (EMD
Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). Protein standards were

 run concurrently to approximate molecular weight. Sam-
ples were not heated prior to being loaded into the gel.
Samples were loaded for SDS–PAGE with 1X Tris–
glycine–SDS running buffer and were run at a constant
voltage (125 V) for 120 min. Following electrophoresis,
the gel was washed once in 1X zymogram renaturing buf-
fer which was then decanted and the gel was next washed
twice with 1X zymogram developing buffer. For the sec-
ond washing, the gel was incubated at 37 °C overnight.
For staining, the gel was washed with Simply Blue Safe
stain (diluted 1:2 with deionized water) for 60 min. The
stain was then decanted, and the gel was washed in deion-
ized water for 24 h. Digital quantification of zymograms
was performed using NIH IMAGE J software.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analysis was performed by a biostatistician
(RWM).
Summary
statistics
were
expressed
as
a
mean � standard deviation. To analyze the clinical scores,
percent reduction of the area of corneal ulceration and
zymography results, a two-factor model was used. The
factor of treatment group is a between-subjects factor
while the factor of time is a within-subjects factor.
Because it is difficult to assess the assumption of normality
with the small amount of data available, a nonparametric
approach was used. Specifically, a rank transformation was
used to test for main effect group differences18 and an
aligned rank transformation was used to test for group by
time interactions19; P < 0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS
Six hours following wounding, the highest scores of each
treatment group were recorded as 11 for a dog in group A
and 10.5 for a dog in group B. At this time point, the
mean mMS score of group A was 10.67 � 0.29 and the
mean mMS score of group B was 10.50 � 0. The mMS
scores decreased throughout the study period, and at the
study’s end point, the mean mMS score of group A was
1.67 � 0.14 and the mean mMS score of group B was
1.67 � 0.14. Regarding clinical scores, the main effect of
treatment group was not significant (P = 0.50) and the
group
by
time
interaction
term
was
not
significant
(P = 0.77). No difference in clinical scores between treat-
ment groups at any time point was detected (see Table 2).
The total time required to achieve corneal re-epithelia-
lization of the ulcer bed was not different between treat-
ment groups; one dog in each group was healed at 72 h
after wounding while the remaining four dogs were all
healed at 96 h postwounding. Figure 2 is a composite of
extraocular photographs documenting the clinical course
of re-epithelialization in a representative dog from group
A. When analyzing the percent reduction of ulceration,
the main effect of treatment group was not significant
(P = 0.55) and the group by time interaction term was
also not significant (P = 0.13). No statistical difference
between treatment groups in the rate of corneal wound
healing was detected at any time point.
MMP2 and MMP9 were detected in baseline tears from
the left eye. The expression of MMP2 and MMP9 was
increased 6 h after wounding. The expression of both
MMP2 and MMP9 in the tears from the left eye contin-
ued to increase until 24 h after wounding. Tears collected
at 48, 72, and 96 h postwounding showed a dramatic
decrease in the MMP2 and MMP9 expression. These
trends in MMP2 and MMP9 expression in the tears from
the left eye are shown in Figs 3 and 4, respectively.

of any dog at 96 h after wounding while MMP2 was
found in the tears of two dogs from group B.
DISCUSSION
The addition of hyaluronic acid to standard therapy for
canine corneal ulceration is controversial among veterinary
ophthalmologists. Results of previous studies performed in
other species suggest that hyaluronic acid accelerates
epithelial corneal wound healing when compared to saline
control.12–14,20 The results of this study found no differ-
ence in corneal re-epithelialization after superficial ulcera-
tion in dogs. Carboxymethylcellulose was utilized as the
viscosity-neutral control in the current study, whereas
PBS was used as the control in all prior investigations.
Hyaluronic acid is a non-Newtonian fluid, similar to the
precorneal tear film, and consequently demonstrates shear
thinning behavior.11,21,22 Thus, hyaluronic acid is able to
maintain a high viscosity at a low shear stress resulting in
a prolonged precorneal residence time during the inter-
blink. During blinking, high shear stress is created across
the corneal epithelium and hyaluronic acid becomes less
viscous which allows the shear stress of blinking to be well
tolerated.
In addition to its viscoelastic properties, the retention of
hyaluronic acid on the cornea may also be the result of
biochemical interactions.23 Hyaluronic acid is a known
ligand of CD44, a cell membrane glycoprotein which is
normally found on corneal cells.24 The expression of
CD44 is upregulated in corneal epithelial wounds, a
process which could further enhance the adherence of
hyaluronic acid to the cornea.3,25 Conversely, PBS lacks
these beneficial viscoelastic and biochemical properties.
Phosphate-buffered saline acts as a Newtonian fluid, main-
taining a constant viscoelastic state, regardless of shear
stress and has a significantly shorter precorneal retention
time compared to hyaluronic acid and other ocular lubri-
cants.11,26 Due to these factors, utilizing PBS as a control
in a study evaluating the efficacy of a hyaluronic acid in
corneal wound healing is not appropriate in our authors’
opinion.
An additional benefit of hyaluronic acid which PBS lacks
is its ability to promote precorneal tear film stability.27,28
Precorneal tear film is needed for maintenance of a healthy
ocular surface as it provides oxygen and various growth
factors to the avascular cornea. Healthy precorneal tear film
contains epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming
growth factor-beta (TGF-b), two signaling molecules that
play a critical role in corneal epithelial wound healing.29,30
The precorneal tear film aids in the mechanical removal of
pathogens, foreign bodies, and debris through mechanisms
of blinking and reflex tearing. It also contains numerous
antimicrobial compounds, including conventional antimi-
crobial compounds such as lysozyme, lactoferrin, lipocalin,
secretory immunoglobulin A, and complement, and also,
more recently detected antimicrobial proteins include sur-
factant protein-D and members of the cationic antimicro-
bial peptide family.31 The superficial lipid layer of the
precorneal tear film is thought to possess antimicrobial
properties; in a recent study, it was demonstrated that mei-
bomian lipids significantly inhibited bacterial growth and
caused extensive damage to bacteria.32 As PBS does not
promote precorneal tear film stability, it does not bolster
corneal health and defense in a manner similar to hyaluro-
nic acid and thus is further evidence that it is not an appro-
priate control for this type of study.
Due to structural, physiologic, and biologic differences
between hyaluronic acid and PBS, carboxymethylcellulose
was selected as control for this study. Carboxymethylcellu-
lose is a negatively charged, cellulose-derived polysaccha-
ride which demonstrates shear thinning behavior and
subsequent
prolonged
precorneal
retention
times
and
increases precorneal tear film stability.33–36 Despite pos-
sessing similar characteristics to hyaluronic acid, previous
studies comparing the efficacy of carboxymethylcellulose
and hyaluronic acid in various ocular diseases produced
conflicting results. Moreira et al. found that hyaluronic
acid accelerates corneal epithelial wound healing in rabbits

 compared
to
carboxymethylcellulose
while
Lee
et al.
showed that both hyaluronic acid and carboxymethylcellu-
lose significantly improved corneal and conjunctival vital
staining, tear film break up time, and dry eye symptom
scores but did not find a statistical difference between the
two treatment groups.37,38 As carboxymethylcellulose is an
anionic polysaccharide, with non-Newtonian rheological
properties and prolonged precorneal residence times, it
was considered a reasonable and appropriate control for
the current study.
While neither hyaluronic acid nor carboxymethylcellu-
lose altered the rate of corneal wound healing, adminis-
tration of modified forms of these polysaccharides may
promote
rapid
re-epithelization
of
corneal
ulceration.
Specifically, a recently developed form of hyaluronic acid,
known
as
cross-linked
hyaluronic
acid,
has
shown
promise as a corneal wound healing accelerant and supe-
rior tear substitute.12,39. However, the previous studies
assessing the efficacy of cross-linked hyaluronic acid in
corneal wound healing used PBS as a control. Therefore,
future studies should compare the efficacy of cross-linked
and non-cross-linked hyaluronic acid in corneal wound
healing.
The current study not only evaluated the rate of wound
healing but also the expression of MMP2 and MMP9.
MMP2 and MMP9 are integral components of the natural
wound healing process as these proteinases and their inhi-
bitory
proteins
(tissue
inhibitor
of
metalloproteinase)
orchestrate the degradation and remodeling of ulcerated
cornea.39 A previous immunohistochemistry study investi-
gating the presence of MMP2 and MMP9 in normal and
ulcerated canine corneas demonstrated that MMP2 appears
to be constitutively expressed in normal cornea and is
upregulated in ulcerated corneas, while MMP9 is only
expressed in ulcerated cornea.10 While intimately associ-
ated with the cornea, the precorneal tear film does not
directly reflect the MMP content of the cornea. Wang
et al. used zymography to demonstrate that MMP2 and
MMP9 are found in the lacrimal fluid of normal canine
eyes and that the expression of these MMPs increases in
Pseudomonasa aeruginosa-associated keratitis.40 In the cur-
rent study, gelatin zymography was used to evaluate the
expression of MMP2 and MMP9 in the precorneal tear
film and results were consistent with the aforementioned
study, as both MMP2 and MMP9 were detected in the
lacrimal fluid of the left eye prior to epithelial debridement
and their expression increased following corneal wounding.
One difference between the current study and that by
Wang et al. was MMP9 expression in the precorneal tear
film of healed corneas. MMP9 was undetectable in the
tears collected after corneal epithelialization was complete
in the current study while Wang et al. found that MMP9
continued to be expressed in the lacrimal fluid of healed
corneas. A possible explanation for this difference is the
lack of exogenous proteinases in this study. Pseudomonasa
aeruginosa produces alkaline protease and elastase and pro-
motes the expression of endogenous proteases specifically
MMP2 and MMP9.41–43 Here, ulcerated canine corneas
were not infected by bacterial or fungal pathogens, and
therefore without the influence of exogenous proteinase,
production of MMP9 is likely not promoted.
Hyaluronic acid may have an effect on MMP expres-
sion. While the expression of MMP2 and MMP9 was not
significant between treatment groups in this study, the
MMP2 and MMP9 expressions of those dogs receiving
hyaluronic acid were notably increased not only from
baseline but also in comparison with those dogs receiving
the control treatment, most notably at the 24-h time
point. Hyaluronic acid can increase MMP2 and MMP9
expression and promote the conversion of these MMPs
from their latent to their active isoform in various ocular
tissues, including corneal epithelial cells in vitro and deb-
rided corneas in vivo.44–46 In the current study, expression
of total MMPs was measured. Hyaluronic acid may accel-
erate epithelial cell migration by increasing the expression
of MMPs which help remodel the extracellular matrix of
wounded corneas.

 The authors acknowledge the small sample size used in
the present study. Prior to study initiation, a power analysis
was performed and it was determined that 12 animals per
group would be required to detect a clinically significant
difference in healing rates of 12 h with a power of 0.8 and
a = 0.05. A study size of 24 dogs was deemed impractical
given concerns of animal resources for this pilot study.
Another potential limitation of this study was the age of
the canine subjects. The dogs used in this study were
approximately 1 year old and considerably younger than
many clinical canine patients who present with nontrau-
matic, superficial ulcerative keratitis.47,48 With age, the
diameter of corneal epithelial cells enlarges and kerato-
cytes
decrease
in
number.49
Additionally,
SCCED
patients, with a mean age of 9 years,47 develop an atypical
hyaline membrane in the anterior stroma. These various,
age-related changes to the epithelial cells and underlying
extracellular matrix could alter the manner in which vis-
coelastic agents interact with the surrounding ocular envi-
ronment and affect corneal wound healing.
A third possible limitation was our choice of control.
The ideal control would only contain vehicle; however, if
topical vehicle was utilized, it would have lacked essential
rheological properties and been similar to PBS. Although
carboxymethylcellulose shares rheological properties simi-
lar to those of hyaluronic acid, previous studies suggest
that it too may promote wound healing.50 Future studies
could utilize not only hyaluronic acid and carboxymethyl-
cellulose but also other topical tear substitutes to assess
the effect of different viscoelastic substances in corneal
wound healing.
CONCLUSION
In summary, the results of this study indicated that while a
topical ophthalmic agent containing hyaluronic acid is well
tolerated, the addition of this viscoelastic polysaccharide does
not accelerate corneal wound healing when compared to a
control with similar viscosity and biochemical properties.
