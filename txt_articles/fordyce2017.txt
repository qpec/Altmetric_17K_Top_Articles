IMPORTANCE Guidelines recommend noninvasive testing for patients with stable chest pain,
although many subsequently have normal test results and no adverse clinical events.
OBJECTIVE To describe a risk tool developed to use only pretest clinical data to identify
patients with chest pain with normal coronary arteries and no clinical events during follow-up
(minimal-risk cohort).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This secondary analysis of a randomized, pragmatic
comparative effectiveness trial (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of
Chest Pain [PROMISE]) includes stable, symptomatic outpatients without known coronary
artery disease referred for noninvasive testing at 193 sites in North America.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to receive coronary computed tomography
angiography (CCTA) vs functional testing.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES A low-risk tool was developed and internally validated from
July 27, 2010, to September 19, 2013, in 4631 patients receiving CCTA as their initial test, with
a median follow-up of 25 months. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate pretest
variables to determine factors associated with minimal risk using a two-thirds random sample
for model derivation (n = 3087) and a one-third sample for testing and validation (n = 1544).
The model was then applied to the CCTA and functional testing arms, and test results and
event rates were ascertained.
RESULTS A total of 1243 of 4631 patients (26.8%) were in the minimal-risk cohort. The final
minimal-risk model included 10 clinical variables that together were correlated with normal
CCTA results and no clinical events (C statistic = 0.725 for the derivation and validation
subsets; 95% CI, 0.705-0.746): younger age; female sex; racial or ethnic minority; no history
of hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia; family history of premature coronary artery
disease; never smoking; symptoms unrelated to physical or mental stress; and higher
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. Across the entire PROMISE cohort, this model was
associated with the lowest rates of severely abnormal test results (1.3% for CCTA; 5.6% for
functional) and cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction (0.5% for a median of 25
months) among patients at the highest probability (10th decile) of minimal risk.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In contemporary practice, more than 25% of patients with
stable chest pain referred for noninvasive testing will have normal coronary arteries and no
long-term clinical events. A clinical tool using readily available pretest variables discriminates
such minimal-risk patients, for whom deferred testing may be considered.

C
urrent guidelines recommend noninvasive testing in
symptomatic patients with intermediate pretest prob-
ability of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD).1
However, studies of outpatients with a clinical syndrome of
possible ischemia found that most functional test results are
normal, and more than 95% of those patients will not experi-
ence an untoward clinical event during 2 years of follow-up,2-5
even among those thought to be at intermediate pretest like-
lihood of CAD by traditional risk assessment tools, such as the
Diamond-Forresterriskscore.6-9Thesefindingshaveledtosub-
stantial concerns about overtesting10 and development of ap-
propriate use criteria to guide clinical decision making11 but
little in the way of novel approaches to quantitative risk as-
sessment that might better guide decision making.
Patients unlikely to have CAD, clinical events, or revascu-
larization will derive minimal benefit and value from nonin-
vasive testing. If such patients can be identified before test-
ing, the need for testing and its associated costs might be
reduced. Safely deferred testing even in a modest percentage
ofpatientswouldbeanattractivestrategyinanerawhenhealth
care systems are accountable for costs and outcomes.12
Wehypothesizedthatthehighlyannotatedbaselinedemo-
graphic and clinical pretest data available in the Prospective
Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain
(PROMISE) trial would allow creation of a risk model useful for
identifying patients unlikely to benefit from noninvasive test-
ing,definedasthosewithnormaltestresults(includingnocoro-
nary atherosclerosis) and no clinical events during the subse-
quent 2 years of follow-up. We then used the model to develop
a clinical tool to aid health care professionals in identifying pa-
tients who may derive minimal or no value from noninvasive
testing for whom deferring testing may be considered.
Methods
Study Population and Design
PROMISE was a pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial that
enrolled10 003evaluablepatientsat193sitesinNorthAmerica
representing community practices and academic medical cen-
ters. The PROMISE study design and primary results have been
described in detail.7,13 The study enrolled stable sympto-
matic outpatients without known CAD referred for noninva-
sive testing for further evaluation from July 27, 2010, to Sep-
tember 19, 2013. Patients were randomized to an initial
anatomical testing strategy with coronary computed tomog-
raphy angiography (CCTA) or a functional testing strategy
(exercise treadmill testing, stress echocardiography, or stress
nuclear imaging) and then followed up for a median of 25
months for outcome events. The study protocol was ap-
provedbythelocalorcentralinstitutionalreviewboardateach
coordinating center and at each of the 193 enrolling sites in
North America (eAppendix 1 in the Supplement). Written in-
formed consent was obtained from all patients.
Definition and Derivation of the Minimal-Risk Cohort
Of the 10 003 patients randomized in PROMISE, the 4633 pa-
tients who were randomized to and received CCTA as an ini-
tial noninvasive test served as the initial analytic group in this
secondary analysis of PROMISE (Figure). Only patients receiv-
ing CCTA as their initial test were included in model develop-
ment because the definition of normal in this cohort in-
cluded those without any detectable atherosclerosis who are
at the lowest risk of adverse events.14 Patients were catego-
rized as being at minimal risk if they underwent CCTA that pro-
duced normal results and if all of the following conditions de-
fined a priori were met: (1) coronary artery calcium score was
0 or was not obtained; (2) no evidence of atherosclerosis;
(3)overallstudyqualitywasdiagnostic(ie,sufficientdataqual-
ity for interpretation); (4) left ventricular function was nor-
mal or not reported; (5) no wall motion abnormalities were
present or not reported; and (6) no relevant cardiovascular in-
cidental findings that could account for the patients’symp-
toms(ie,aorticdissectionorpulmonaryembolism)werenoted.
All patients with normal CCTA results were included in the
minimal-risk cohort in the absence of any of the following ad-
judicated clinical events during the median 25-month fol-
low-up period: all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarc-
tion (MI), unstable angina hospitalization, or revascularization
during the entire follow-up period. The final study cohort con-
sisted of 1243 minimal-risk patients and 3388 other patients
(n = 4631) (Figure).
Statistical Analysis
Continuous baseline characteristics were summarized using
means and SDs or medians with 25th and 75th percentiles. Cat-
egoricalvariablesweresummarizedusingfrequenciesandper-
centages. Group comparisons with respect to continuous base-
line variables were performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum
test; the Pearson χ2 test or Fisher exact test was used for com-
parisons that involved categorical variables. Statistical signifi-
cance was set at α = .05. All analyses were performed with SAS
statistical software, version 9.4 or JMP Pro, version 12.1 (SAS
Institute Inc).
Complete data were available for most of the baseline vari-
ables included in the a priori–specified list of interest. How-
ever, for total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which
had more than 5% missingness, imputation was performed
with a single imputation procedure, namely, the fully condi-
tional specification method using PROC MI in SAS, version 9.4.
Key Points
Question Is it possible to create a risk tool to identify
intermediate-risk patients with stable chest pain unlikely to
benefit from noninvasive testing?
Findings In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial,
1243 of 4631 patients (26.8%) with stable chest pain had normal
coronary arteries (without atherosclerosis) and no long-term
clinical events. These minimal-risk patients can be identified with
good discrimination using pretest clinical characteristics alone.
Meaning A clinical tool using readily available pretest variables
discriminates such minimal-risk patients, for whom deferred
testing may be considered.

Using the final study cohort, we performed a random two-
thirds to one-third data split to create a model development
subset (n = 3087) and a model testing and validation subset
(n = 1544) (Figure). In the model development subset, multi-
variable logistic regression analysis was used to identify base-
line (pretest) variables that were useful in discriminating the
minimal-risk patients from the other patients and creating a
model for identifying which patients were likely to fall into the
minimal-risk category. For continuous baseline variables, we
examined the shape and strength of the association between
individualvariablesandwhetherpatientswereintheminimal-
risk group using a flexible model-fitting approach that in-
volved restricted cubic spline functions (cubic polynomials).15
Categorical variables with more than 3 levels were collapsed
to 3 clinically meaningful categories. After examining univari-
ate associations, a multivariable logistic regression model for
assessing the probability of minimal risk was fit using the back-
ward variable selection method with all the a priori–specified
covariates that were significantly different at the α = .05 level
between the minimal-risk and other groups or were consid-
ered clinically relevant. The model derived in the model de-
velopment data set, including the variables selected and their
corresponding variable estimates, was then applied to the test-
ing and validation data set to assess the model’
s performance
in an independent sample.
The measure of predictive discrimination used to char-
acterize model performance in the model development and
validation samples was the area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUC) or C statistic.16 Calibration of the
model predictions was assessed by graphic comparison of
the observed proportion of minimal-risk patients to the
mean model prediction across deciles of the potential prob-
abilities of minimal risk. In addition, the Hosmer-Lemeshow
statistic was calculated to statistically assess model calibra-
tion. Finally, a sensitivity analysis using bootstrapping as an
alternative model-building strategy was performed as a com-
parison to the initial model-building approach. The mean
C statistic was computed and reported based on 1000 boot-
strap samples.
With the use of the final model, the potential probability
of minimal risk was computed for each person in the CCTA and
functional testing cohorts. For each cohort, the distribution of
potential probabilities was divided into deciles, with the first
decile including patients with the lowest potential probabili-
ties of minimal risk (ie, the patients least likely to be minimal
risk) and the 10th decile including patients with the highest
potential probabilities (ie, the patients most likely to be mini-
mal risk). Additional details of the model application and the
comparison to other risk scores are provided in eAppendix 2
in the Supplement.
After validation of the model, the variables selected in
the model development phase were refit in a final multivari-
able logistic regression model using the entire CCTA cohort
(n = 4631) to obtain more robust variable estimates for
application to other patient cohorts. The resulting C statistic
was reported, as well as odds ratios and 95% CIs (as esti-
mated by the Mann-Whitney test), for each variable in the
model.

Results
Study Population and Cohorts
Of the 4631 patients in the CCTA arm, 1243 patients (26.8%)
had a completely normal CCTA result and no clinical events
during the median 25-month follow-up period; these pa-
tients were categorized as the minimal-risk cohort (Figure). In
contrast, 3388 patients (73.2%) had an abnormal CCTA result
and/or experienced a clinical event; they were categorized as
theothercohort.Amongpatientsinthederivationsubset(two-
thirds of patients, n = 3087), there were many statistically sig-
nificant differences in baseline clinical characteristics be-
tween the minimal-risk (n = 829; mean [SD] age, 57.8 [7.2]
years; 526 females [63.4%]; 219 racial or ethnic minority
[26.6%]) and other (n = 2258) patients (Table 1). A complete
list of baseline clinical characteristics for the entire CCTA study
population, including all variables considered for model build-
ing, is given in eTable 1 in the Supplement.
Results of Multivariable Model
On the basis of the multivariable analysis in the model devel-
opment subset, 10 pretest clinical variables independently
assessed the probability of patients being categorized as mini-
mal risk (Table 2). The C statistic was 0.725 (95% CI, 0.705-
0.746). Using the variable estimates obtained in the model de-
velopment subset and applying the model to the independent
validation subset, which consisted of 1544 randomly se-
lected patients undergoing CCTA, yielded a nearly identical
C statistic of 0.725 (95% CI, 0.698-0.753); when the model was
applied to the entire CCTA population, the C statistic was 0.726
(95% CI, 0.710-0.742). Sensitivity analyses using bootstrap-
ping resulted in a similar C statistic of 0.728.
Model Calibration
Calibration of the model when applied to the independent
validation data set was examined by comparing the observed
proportion of minimal-risk patients with the mean potential
probability of minimal risk by deciles of the potential prob-
abilities (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Excellent calibration
is demonstrated graphically and by the Hosmer–Lemeshow
calibration statistic (χ2 = 9.46, P = .30).
Test Results and Clinical Event Rates by Probability
of Minimal Risk
With the variables selected, the minimal-risk model was refit
in the full PROMISE CCTA cohort (n = 4631). As reported in
Table 3, as the probability of minimal risk increased, the prob-
ability of a normal CCTA also increased, whereas the probabil-
ity decreased of an abnormal or severely abnormal test re-
sult. As outlined in eTable 2 in the Supplement, a severely
abnormal CCTA result was defined as having 1 of the follow-
ing: 2-vessel disease (≥70%) or 50% or more left main artery
stenosis or 70% or more proximal left anterior descending ar-
tery stenosis. Similar data were found when the model was ap-
pliedtothefunctionaltestingcohort.However,comparedwith
the CCTA cohort, at the highest probability of minimal risk, pa-
tients in the functional arm had greater rates of normal test re-
sults(85.2%vs63.9%)andseverelyabnormaltestresults(5.6%
vs 1.3%). In the entire study population (combined CCTA and
functional cohorts), as the probability of minimal risk in-
creased, the probability of cardiovascular death and MI de-
creased, with the lowest event rate among patients with the
highest probability of minimal risk (0.5% during a median 25
months of follow-up; 10th decile or 0.25% per year).
Comparison With Other Risk Scores
eFigure 2 in the Supplement shows the AUCs for the PROMISE
minimal-risk model compared with the Framingham and
Diamond-Forrester/Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) risk
scores for the assessment of minimal risk when applied to the
entire CCTA population. The PROMISE minimal-risk model
(AUC = 0.726; 95% CI, 0.710-0.742) better characterized pa-
tients as minimal risk compared with the Framingham
(AUC = 0.686; 95% CI, 0.670-0.704) and Diamond-Forrester/
CASS risk scores (AUC = 0.606; 95% CI, 0.589-0.624).
PROMISE Minimal-Risk Tool and Patient Example
eFigure 3 in the Supplement shows the variables required and
theoutputgeneratedusingthePROMISEminimal-risktool(this
information is also available online at promiserisktools.com).
A 50-year-old white woman with atypical chest pain, a medi-
calhistoryofhypertension,andahigh-densitylipoproteincho-
lesterol level of 70 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter,
multiply by 0.0259) is in the 10th decile of minimal risk. On
average, patients in the 10th decile from PROMISE had a 63.9%
probability of having a normal CCTA result, a 1.3% chance of a
severely abnormal CCTA result, and a 0.5% risk of cardiovas-
cular death or nonfatal MI during a 25-month follow-up pe-
riod. The individual patient whose data are shown is esti-
mated to have a probability of 0.76 of being at minimal risk
(normal CCTA result and no clinical events).
Discussion
Among PROMISE patients undergoing evaluation for stable
chest pain with an intermediate pretest probability of CAD,
26.8% had a normal CCTA result, no clinical events, and no re-
vascularization during a median 25 months of follow-up. A
modelthatincludedonlypretestdemographicandclinicaldata
identified this minimal-risk cohort with good discrimination
(C statistic = 0.725) and improved existing risk scores. From
thatmodelwedevelopedapretestdecisionsupporttooltohelp
cliniciansidentifypatientswithstablechestpainwhoarelikely

Theabilitytoidentifyasubsetofintermediatepretestprob-
ability patients with stable chest pain who might safely defer

yield of testing in current practice and the associated costs.
Studies2-5,7 suggest that the results of most functional stress
studies on outpatients with a clinical syndrome of possible is-
chemia are normal, and nearly all such patients will not expe-
rience an untoward clinical event. To our knowledge, few prior
analyses have attempted to identify and validate a set of de-
scriptors that could be used to help clinicians identify a sub-

likely to receive little or no benefit from noninvasive testing.
The concept of not testing such patients is commensurate with

ability of obstructive disease is greater than 10%.1
The model used 10 pretest variables commonly available
during the evaluation of a symptomatic patient with chest
pain; we incorporated these variables into a simple risk
assessment tool, allowing individual risk estimation. This
tool provides useful information in terms of the probability
of minimal risk but also the probabilities of an individual
patient having any abnormal or a severely abnormal test
result (CCTA and functional) or a clinical event. Although the
clinical threshold to recommend noninvasive testing may
vary, it may be reasonable to consider deferral of noninva-
sive testing for some patients. We acknowledge that approxi-
mately one-third of patients in the 10th decile (highest prob-
ability of minimal risk) still have some mild degree of

coronary atherosclerosis (Table 3). However, few in this
group have obstructive disease, and even fewer have a sub-
sequent adverse event during follow-up. To put this infor-
mation into context, patients in our study with the highest
probability of minimal risk had a lower risk profile (0.5% risk
of cardiovascular death and MI at a median 25 months of
follow-up) compared with a disease-free, asymptomatic
50-year-old cohort from the Framingham Heart Study (1.4%
annual risk of MI, coronary insufficiency, cardiovascular
death, angina pectoris, atherothrombotic stroke, and inter-
mittent claudication for males and 0.7% for females).17
Strengths and Limitations
The analysis has several advantages. Data from the patients
in the CCTA arm of PROMISE were used to develop the risk
tool model because CCTA can identify patients with normal
coronary arteries with high accuracy,18,19 and having no
atherosclerosis represents the lowest-risk patients.14 The
pragmatic nature of PROMISE well reflects contemporary
community practice. The large size of the PROMISE CCTA
database allowed cohorts with large sample sizes, as well as
the creation of distinct derivation and validation groups.
Furthermore, application of the model derived and validated
within the CCTA arm to the PROMISE functional testing arm
supports its generalizability, with the lowest event rates
among patients with the greatest probability of minimal risk
(10th decile) in both arms. Therefore, clinicians who are con-
sidering functional testing may also contemplate using this
risk tool because its risk outputs are not specific to the
intended test result type. Finally, the model itself has good
discrimination (C statistic = 0.725), consistent validation (in-
cluding using sensitivity analyses with bootstrapping), and
excellent calibration. Importantly, this model identifies the
minimal-risk patient cohort better than the traditional
Diamond-Forrester/CASS and Framingham risk scores that
are currently in clinical use.
There are some advantages of this PROMISE clinical tool
compared with other risk scores. The combined Diamond-
Forrester/CASS risk score, currently recommended in the
2012 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Asso-
ciation guidelines,1 was not designed to identify patients
unlikely to benefit from testing but rather to describe the
likely findings because patients were already destined to
receive noninvasive or invasive testing. The first Coronary
CT Angiography Evaluation for Clinical Outcomes: An Inter-
national Multicenter (CONFIRM) Registry risk score20 dem-
onstrates the incremental prognostic information derived
from identification of plaque burden and stenosis on CCTA,
was derived in a mixed population of patients (asymptom-
atic and symptomatic), requires noninvasive testing by defi-
nition as part of the score, and thus does not aid in the deci-
sion to test or defer testing. A subsequent CONFIRM risk
score developed using only medical history included only
symptomatic patients but is limited by not reporting cardio-
vascular death (only MI and all-cause mortality are
reported).21 Unlike the PROMISE risk tool, this score did not
aim to identify patients without coronary plaque (only those
without a coronary stenosis ≥50%), which CONFIRM itself
has shown to be prognostically important. Furthermore, our
risk tool is more generalizable to a full functional testing
population because neither CONFIRM score was applied to
patients undergoing exercise treadmill testing alone, stress
echocardiography, or nuclear perfusion with pharmacologic
stress. Thus, in addition to the entirely pretest nature of the
variables in our model, we evaluated a symptomatic cohort
and incorporated the probability of normal test results (un-
like the CONFIRM and Diamond-Forrester/CASS risk scores)
and freedom from downstream events (unlike the Diamond-
Forrester risk score) as end points in our model.
A method to identify patients who may derive minimal
benefit from testing has several potential implications for
patients, clinicians, and clinical practice in general. For
patients, this process can mean a reduction in testing from
which they would not benefit, thereby saving time, anxiety,
and cost, as well as a potential reduction in radiation expo-
sure and false-positive test results that could lead to more
invasive, unnecessary procedures. For clinicians, this tool
has the potential to help optimize office-based decision
making. From a practice and societal perspective, in an era
in which practitioners are increasingly held accountable for
costs and quality, identifying patients unlikely to benefit
from potentially expensive testing and who may be man-
aged conservatively has many potential economic and
process-of-care advantages.
This study has some limitations. It is unclear how these
results might apply to a higher-risk group with a greater preva-
lence of disease or incidence of events or those who did not
consent to participate in a clinical trial. However, the results
aregeneratedfromthelargestcontemporary,real-worldevalu-
ation of the role of noninvasive testing among patients with
stable chest pain, which strengthens its generalizability. In ad-
dition,theriskmodelwasderivedandvalidatedusingtheCCTA
cohort and therefore does not address other valid reasons to
test, including but not limited to obtaining knowledge of func-
tional capacity or reproduction of symptoms and their asso-
ciation with exertion. Although the model was found to be ro-
bust when applied to a distinct validation subset with the
PROMISE trial data set, further validation of the tool within
other independent data samples will provide greater general-
izability. Finally, our tool is not intended to act as concrete de-
cision support to test or not test patients, which would re-
quire a randomized clinical trial for validation. Rather, it is an
aidthatquantifiesminimalriskandpotentiallyidentifiesasub-
set of patients who are unlikely to benefit from proceeding
directly to noninvasive testing.
Conclusions
More than one-quarter of stable, symptomatic outpatients
with suspected CAD who currently have an indication for
noninvasive testing have no coronary atherosclerosis and no
revascularization procedures or clinical cardiac events dur-
ing a median 2-year period. These patients can be identified
using pretest clinical characteristics alone, including risk fac-
tor profile, symptom characteristics, and lipid values. These

variables can be used to inform a user-friendly, point-of-care
decision support tool quantifying the likelihood of having a
normal test result and no clinical events. If a high likelihood
of a normal test result and low clinical event rate is identi-
fied, clinicians could consider, including through shared
decision making, a strategy of deferred testing for such
patients because the benefit and value of testing are likely to
be low.
