Surveillance of Barrett’s oesophagus allows us to study the evolutionary dynamics of a human
neoplasm over time. Here we use multicolour fluorescence in situ hybridization on brush
cytology specimens, from two time points with a median interval of 37 months in 195
non-dysplastic Barrett’s patients, and a third time point in a subset of 90 patients at a median
interval of 36 months, to study clonal evolution at single-cell resolution. Baseline genetic
diversity predicts progression and remains in a stable dynamic equilibrium over time. Clonal
expansions are rare, being detected once every 36.8 patient years, and growing at an average
rate of 1.58 cm2 (95% CI: 0.09–4.06) per year, often involving the p16 locus. This suggests a
lack of strong clonal selection in Barrett’s and that the malignant potential of ‘benign’ Barrett’s
lesions is predetermined, with important implications for surveillance programs.

arcinogenesis is fundamentally an evolutionary process,
whereby cells that have acquired advantageous somatic
mutations clonally expand via a process of Darwinian
natural selection1,2. Initial models of this process, based on the
organismal evolution and evidence that multiple mutations were
required
to
generate
a
cancer,
assumed
progression
was
characterized by a series of clonal expansions, each sweeping to
fixation within the tumour. Barrett’s oesophagus (BE) provides an
ideal condition to study the dynamics of somatic evolution over
both space and time in humans in vivo3. However, despite
extensive genomic analysis of BE and its associated esophageal
adenocarcinoma (EAC)4–6, the dynamics of clonal evolution,
including changes in the clonal diversity, as well as the frequency
and rate of clonal expansions, have remained largely unchara-
cterized, as is the case for all neoplasms. The evolutionary
dynamics of Barrett’s clones are important both for under-
standing the fundamental process of neoplastic progression and
for the clinical management of the disease.
BE is an acquired metaplastic epithelial change in the lower
oesophagus, thought to be an adaptive response to chronic
gastro-esophageal reflux3,7. Patients with BE have an increased
risk
of
developing
EAC8.
However,
the
absolute
risk
of
progression
in
particular
for
Barrett’s
patients
without
dysplastic changes is only 0.12–0.6% per year8,9 and most of
these patients will never progress to EAC in their lifetime.
Following current guidelines, BE patients are enrolled in
endoscopic surveillance programs to detect dysplasia and early
cancers that can be effectively cured by minimally invasive
interventions10–12. Due to a lack of tools for robust risk
stratification, and the costs involved, the clinical management
and surveillance strategy for the large group of non-dysplastic
Barrett’s (NDBE) patients is debated. Measurements of the
evolutionary
process
that
drives
progression
may
provide
universal
biomarkers
for
robust
risk
stratification.
These
evolutionary biomarkers could be universal in their applicability
to virtually all types of neoplasms2,13–15.
Here we analyse multicolour fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) data to assess the genetic diversity at single-cell resolution
in NDBE patients. We confirm that genetic diversity correlates
with the risk of progression to cancer. Moreover, we show that
the level of genetic diversity is invariant over time, suggesting an
absence of strong selection in the evolution in NDBE and
consequently that progression risk is predetermined by the
invariant baseline level of diversity. Finally, we provide estimates
of the in vivo rate of clonal expansion and contraction of mutant
clones in a human metaplastic lesion.
Results
Multicolour FISH reveals genetic diversity on a single-cell
basis. We performed DNA FISH analysis on endoscopic brush
cytology specimens collected from 320 Barrett’s patients who all
had effective acid suppressive therapy and no morphological
evidence of dysplasia at baseline. Patients were followed for a
median of 43 months (range 11–130 months) during which
20 patients (6.3%) progressed; 8 patients developed high-grade
dysplasia (HGD) and 12 developed EAC after a median duration
of 34 months (Table 1). For 195 of these patients we also analysed
material from a second endoscopy, which included 14 progressors
(HGD, n ¼ 5 and EAC, n ¼ 9), and there was a median interval of
37 months between the first and second brushes (interquartile
range: 34–52). A minimum of 50 cells (Supplementary Fig. 1)
per sample were scored for abnormalities by FISH at seven
markers including CEP7, CEP17, p53, p16, Her-2/neu, 20q and
MYC, organized into two probe sets (Methods). The adequacy
of
counting
this
number
of
cells
to
measure
clone-size
abundance and diversity was confirmed by bootstrap analysis
(Supplementary Fig. 2).
The majority of cells analysed had no detectable abnormalities:
89 and 95% of all cells analysed from probe sets 1 and 2,
respectively, had wild-type genotypes (Fig. 1a). Across patients,
the loss of one p16 allele (hemizygous loss of p16) was the most
frequently observed alteration overall with 51% of the patients
(n ¼ 163) showing p16 loss in at least 5% of cells (Fig. 1b;
Supplementary Fig. 3). In contrast, p53 loss observed in at least
5% of the cells was found in only 7.5% of patients (n ¼ 24), and
relative p53 locus loss16 (defined by copy-loss or fewer copies of
the p53 locus relative to the chr17 centromere (Methods)—
observed in more than 5% of cells was seen in 10.6% of patients
(n ¼ 34). In addition, comparison of the data from multiple
brushes collected at the same endoscopy (termed repeat brushes)
validated the reproducibility of our FISH analysis (Methods and
Supplementary Fig. 4).
A dynamic equilibrium of clones and evolutionary stasis.
Previous studies of the clonal composition of individual Barrett’s
lesions have revealed genetic mosaicism17–19 and we sought to
measure the degree of within-BE segment heterogeneity in our
cohort. We defined a ‘clone’ as the collection of cells with
identical genotype (for example, identical copy-number of each of
the four probes scored in the cells) and quantified genetic
diversity using ecological diversity measures (Methods). Most
samples contained multiple clones (n ¼ 290, 91.6% by probe set 1;
n ¼ 213, 66.6% by probe set 2), and the distributions of diversity
revealed a long tail of patients with very clonally diverse lesions
(Fig. 1c,d). The genetic diversity measured using set 1 probes was
significantly higher than for set 2 (Po0.001, paired t-test), owing
to the prominence of p16 and p53 abnormalities assayed in set 1.
We also evaluated the contribution of each individual probe to
the overall level of diversity in the sample (Fig. 1e). Abnormalities

 of p16 alone were as diverse as the whole second probe set
(P ¼ 0.31, paired t-test). p16 abnormalities explained the majority
of the variance in clonal composition in set 1 (R2 ¼ 0.74;
Po2.2e � 16), and MYC abnormalities were responsible for the
majority of the genetic diversity in set 2 (R2 ¼ 0.80; Po2.2e � 16).
We examined clonal evolution over time in the Barrett’s
patients by comparing the clonal composition between the two
time points for the 195 patients where longitudinal data were
available. An average of 1.4 (s.d. ±1.4) clones in probe set 1 and
1.4 (s.d. ±1.9) clones in probe set 2 detected at the first time
point could not be detected at the second time point (termed ‘lost’
clones), while 1.7 (s.d. ±1.6) clones in probe set 1 and 1.8
(s.d. ±1.8) clones in probe set 2 were found at the second time
point but not the first (termed ‘new’ clones) (Fig. 2a). However,
bootstrap analysis suggested that nearly all of the observed slight
changes in diversity could be reasonably explained by cell
sampling, rather than bona fide changes in the clonal composition
of the lesion (Supplementary Table 1). Nevertheless, a total
of 32 significant changes in diversity were observed (16.4%; 29
non-progressors and 3 progressors) implying a dynamic turnover
of clones within the lesion, whereby clonal expansions are
balanced by the contraction of other clones. Further evidence of
this ‘dynamic equilibrium’ was provided by the observation of
relatively stable levels of genetic diversity over time: the evolution
of diversity did not show any significant trend over the follow-up
interval for either probe set (Fig. 2b,c) and irrespective of the
diversity measure used (Supplementary Fig. 5). Stratification of
the cohort into non-progressors and progressors revealed that
Shannon diversity decreased slightly over time for non-progres-
sors only when measured by probe set 1 (P ¼ 0.012, paired t-test;
Supplementary Fig. 6) but no significant difference was seen for
non-progressors with probe set 2. Progression was associated with
a slight increase in diversity over time in both probe sets, but was
only statistically significant for samples having already progressed
at the second time point in probe set 2 (P ¼ 0.03, paired t-test;
Supplementary Fig. 6). We note that in 8 out of 14 of the eventual
progressors, progression to HGD or EAC had already occurred at
the time of the second brushing and that brushes were obtained
prior to therapy (for example, ablation or endoscopic resection).
Together, these data suggest that clonal structure of sizeable (and
hence reliably detected) clones within non-dysplastic Barrett’s
lesions rarely change significantly over time. In other words,
significant clonal evolution over large swathes of the Barrett’s
epithelium cannot be observed in the majority of Barrett’s
patients, but there rather is a ‘dynamic equilibrium’ of clonal
composition.
Clonal expansions are rare. After correction for multiple testing,
binomial analysis revealed 27 statistically significant clonal
expansions and 45 clonal contractions (Supplementary Table 2)
over 993.6 patient years of observation, an average of 1 detectable
clonal expansion by these methods every 36.8 patient years and 1
clonal contraction every 22.1 patient years. The most frequent
expansions and contractions over time were: normal genotype
increase (n ¼ 23), normal genotype decrease (n ¼ 23) and p16 loss
decrease (n ¼ 19). Of the 32 cases of significant changes in
diversity that we detected, 28 corresponded to significant clonal
expansions/contractions, the 4 others being borderline significant
for clonal expansions/contractions. We used the available data to
try to approximate the growth rate of these clones within the
Barrett’s segment (Methods). Assuming linear growth, this
translated to an average growth rate of 0.6% of the total cell
population per month. Using 1.2 cm as the average radius of the
oesophagus, this corresponds to an increase in the area
of the Barrett’s mucosa occupied by a growing clone of 1.58 cm2
(95% CI: 0.09–4.06) per year, while large contractions occurred at
a rate of 0.4% of the cell population per month, with a corre-
sponding decline in mucosal area of 1.12 cm2 (95% CI: 0.77–4.37)
per year (Fig. 3a,b). Clonal expansions were not associated with
progression (Fisher’s exact test P ¼ 0.54).
Clonal evolution of single abnormalities. We examined whether
the individual abnormalities, as opposed to clones defined by all
the loci in a probe set, underwent consistent (albeit slight)
expansion or contraction over time. Only p16 abnormalities and
20q loss showed consistent changes in clone size across patients
(Supplementary Fig. 7a). Clones with loss of 20q tended to be
larger at the second time point (P ¼ 3.5e � 5, paired t-test) but this
was not associated with progression (P ¼ 0.80, Cox proportional
hazards model). Both contraction of clones with p16 loss and
expansion of clones with p16 gain were observed (P ¼ 8.4e � 3 and

Interestingly, the contraction of clones with copy loss of p16
appeared to be compensated by the expansion of clones with
gains at the p16 locus (Fig. 3c), suggesting that the former may be
replaced by the latter over time (Supplementary Fig. 7b). Clones
with a normal genome were also likely replacements for those
having lost p16 in most cases (Supplementary Fig. 7c), however,
we note that we could not detect true copy-neutral loss of
heterozygosity (cnLOH). The p16 locus is assayed in our probe
set 1, so these data partly explain the previously described lower
diversity observed in set 1 values at the second time point. The
expansion and contractions of p16 mutant clones were not
associated with progression (P ¼ 0.73 and P ¼ 0.55, respectively,
Cox proportional hazards models).
Analysis at a third time point. An additional third brush was
available for a subset of 88 patients, including 5 progressors, taken
at a median of 36 months (range 13–93 months) after their
second brush and at a median of 72 months after the first brush
(range 45–143). These brushes surprisingly revealed a general
decrease in diversity in set 1, but no difference in diversity in set 2
(Supplementary Fig. 8). Analysis of clonal frequencies revealed
that
p16-loss
clones
tended
to
have
contracted
or
even
disappeared at this time point (Po0.001, Supplementary Fig. 9),
similar to what we observed between the first two time points. Of
the 88 patients with a third brush, 22 showed a significant
contraction of p16-loss clones between the first and third time
points,
3
showed
a
significant
expansion
(Supplementary
Table 3). Moreover, expansions or contractions of clones with
abnormal p16 copy number accounted for all significant changes
in diversity in set 1 (Supplementary Fig. 8, right column). In
addition, the five progressors appeared to have moderately higher
diversity values than non-progressors, although this was rarely
significant (Supplementary Fig. 10). The rate of clonal contrac-
tions of p16-loss clones between the second and third time points
was similar to the rate between the first and second time points
(Wilcox-test P ¼ 0.13; Supplementary Fig. 11), although affecting
entirely different patients, despite the less stringent multiple
correction for this smaller cohort at the third time point, which
facilitates detection of smaller changes in clone frequencies.
Similarly to our observations between earlier time points, clones
appeared to be gained at similar rates (1.7±1.1 clone appearing
and 1.6±1.6 clone disappearing between the second and
third time points in set 1; 1.5±1.1 appearing and 1.6±1.8
disappearing in set 2). Together, these data suggest a general and
steady clonal contraction of p16-loss clones over time in the
Barrett’s segment that was not mirrored by any other locus
assayed.
Diversity measures determine progression risk. Our previous
work has shown that a high level of clonal diversity (measured
using biopsies and microsatellite LOH assays) within a Barrett’s
segment is associated with increased risk of progression to
cancer13,15. In this independent cohort of only non-dysplastic
Barrett’s patients, we validated these previous observations using
a different genetic assay and whole surface brushings instead of
random biopsies. Higher levels of clonal diversity that now were
measured by FISH on endoscopic brushings were associated with
increased risk of progression to HGD or cancer, this result being
largely robust to the choice of diversity statistics, and the FISH

 probes included in the measure; univariate Cox proportional
hazards analysis showed that out of the nine statistically
significant predictors of progression, seven were diversity-based,
and the two others being aneusomy and age (respectively seventh
and eighth most significant) (Table 2). Surprisingly, the size of the
biggest clone, evidenced by p53 loss and/or p53 relative locus loss
was not a prognostic marker. Thus, in this cohort of BE patients
with no dysplasia, p53 loss did not bear prognostic potential,
which is in contrast to findings in Barrett cohorts that also
included patients with low- and high-grade dysplasia16,20–22. We
included the significant prognostic markers in a multivariate
model with age and circumferential Barrett’s length (accepted
prognostic factors23–25) and found that all eight genetic variables
were
the
most
significant
predictors
of
progression
(Supplementary Table 4). The segment length was not a
significant prognosticator and we note that while several studies
have indicated that there is an increased risk in longer segments,
others were not able to confirm this finding26,27.
Interestingly, two of the best performing variables were
obtained by single-probe diversity measures that used just the
CEP7 and MYC probes, respectively. We stratified patients as
high- and low-risk using two different thresholds for each
significant diversity measure: (1) samples with values higher than
median (4median threshold) being high risk; (2) samples with
values in the upper quartile (top 25% threshold, used in previous
studies13,15) being high risk. We found that the genetic diversity
measures consistently and effectively separated the progressors
and non-progressors into the appropriate risk groups (Fig. 4,
Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Table 5). These
observations suggest that the level of clonal diversity determines
the progression risk in non-dysplastic Barrett’s patients and that
this risk can even be assessed using single-probe clonal diversity
measures of MYC or CEP7.
We note that neither the size of the clone(s) with p16 copy-
number alterations nor the diversity of p16-altered clones were
significantly associated with cancer development risk (Table 2).
Thus, while p16-altered clones show interesting clonal dynamics
over time, these dynamics appear not to be directly related to the
cancer development risk.
Progression risk is invariant over time. Our data indicated that
the level of clonal diversity measured at baseline in non-dysplastic
BE was indicative of progression risk, and that this level of
diversity did not change significantly over time. Consequently,
we hypothesized that the risk of progression to HGD or cancer
was established early in the development of a Barrett’s lesion
and remained invariant thereafter. To test this idea, we
re-classified patients as high- or low-risk using diversity
measures obtained from the second time point (without chan-
ging the previously defined risk-stratification cutoffs) and tested
whether
these
later
diversity
measures
were
predictive
of the initial progression risk. All measures remained significant
predictors of progression, with the exception of age (Supple-
mentary Fig. 13, Supplementary Table 6) and 10 out of 18
stratifications were still significant after multiple testing. The
average diversity of the two time points was similarly predictive.
We further reproduced this analysis after removing the eight
patients that had already progressed to HGD or cancer at the
second time point, leaving only six progressors. This hindered
statistical power but the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices
were still significant (Supplementary Fig. 14). We performed a
bootstrap analysis to test whether cell sampling error could lead
to patients being moved from low- to high-risk groups or vice-
versa. Our analysis revealed that the best diversity-based stra-
tifications correctly identified all but one progressor in 80–100%

 of all bootstrap simulations (Supplementary Fig. 15). Therefore,
the time at which the BE segment is analysed appears to have
little impact on our ability to distinguish high- and low-risk
patients, suggesting that patients’ risk of progression remained
constant over time. Taken together, we found that the
progression risk of non-dysplastic patients can be effectively
assessed
by
clonal
diversity
measures,
and
that
this
predetermined risk is stable over time. The few progressors for
which we had a brush from a third time point (n ¼ 5) prevented
the reproduction of this analysis at this time point.
Discussion
We have performed a longitudinal study of clonal evolution in a
cohort of non-dysplastic BE at single-cell resolution. At this
cellular resolution, we have been able to confirm previous reports
of frequent and extensive clonal mosaicism within the Barrett’s
segment17,19 in cells collected evenly across the whole Barrett’s
segment, and validated that genetic diversity is a powerful
predictor of progression insensitive to the choice of diversity
statistics using13. Although clonal expansions in our patients were
generally rare, we provide quantification of the frequency and rate
of clonal expansions in a human neoplasm. We only observed one
significant clonal expansion every 36.8 patient years of follow-up,
and in those cases, the clones grew at an average of 1.58 cm2
per year.
Importantly, our data show that measures of clonal diversity
are more prognostic than ‘traditional biomarkers’ that are based
on the detection of particular individual genetic abnormalities.
The relative utility of diversity measures may be due to a number
of factors, not least that traditional biomarkers are prone to
sampling errors, for instance when assayed in randomly taken
biopsies, or when neoplastic progression proceeds along a
non-assayed pathway. In contrast, diversity measures exploit
lesion heterogeneity as a proxy measure of evolvability, the idea
being that more diverse lesions are more likely to contain or
produce a ‘well-adapted’ clone that is able to drive carcinogenesis.
We note that diversity of specific markers was more prognostic
than others, and so optimal prognostication will benefit from
careful choice of markers. Most strikingly, we demonstrate that
several of the single-probe diversity measures (MYC and CEP 7)
were the best predictors in the multivariate analysis, and
conversely that p16-abnormalities are poor prognosticators due
to the initial expansion and then contraction of those clones.
Together our data underline the potential for clonal diversity
measures as robust biomarkers for cancer risk stratification in
endoscopically surveyed Barrett’s patients.
Our results are consistent with previous studies of the Seattle
Barrett’s oesophagus cohort28. That cohort, which includes
dysplastic as well as non-dysplastic BE, has been characterized
by single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays applied to the purified
epithelium from whole biopsies (one every 2 cm of the BE
segment). The degree of genetic divergence between biopsies
remained relatively constant in the non-progressors but 24–48
months prior to progression, massively genetically altered clones
started to appear in the progressors. Also in the Seattle cohort,
clones did not tend to sweep to fixation, and the resulting higher
levels of divergence remained stable over time. Importantly, in
this study we have provided a view of the spatial and temporal
dynamics of clones at cellular resolution.
Due to (likely) lead time bias, the highest incidence of
progression of Barrett’s patients is during the first year of
surveillance whereas the progression risk of the remaining
non-dysplastic Barrett’s surveillance cohort is low. High level
evidence from prospective studies of robust biomarkers to
distinguish future progressors from non progressors in these
low risk cohorts are lacking22. In line with the clinical observation
that progression is rare is the fact that we observed minimal
evolution occurring in our non-dysplastic Barrett’s cohort over
the duration of surveillance. Clonal stasis has been previously
suspected14,28, but the sparse biopsy sampling used in past studies
(as opposed to the endoscopic brushes used here) has meant that
moderately sized clonal expansions may have gone undetected.
The norm appears to be that once a dynamic equilibrium of
clones in the non-dysplastic Barrett’s lesion is established clonal
diversity
levels
remain
relatively
constant
thereafter.
Consequently, those lesions that are established with a high
level of clonal diversity appear to be inherently prone to cancer
development, whereas lesions established with a low level of
clonal diversity appear to be intrinsically non-progressive. Our
data provide some evidence (within the limits of our lesion
sampling) of a continual dynamic turnover of clones within the
Barrett’s mucosa such that the equilibrium level of diversity is
likely to be maintained by an ever changing mosaic of clones. It is,
however, not clear at which time point the dynamic equilibrium
in the Barrett’s tissue is reached. One known risk factor for

 progression of Barrett’s is active reflux disease29. In all study
participants, reflux control was achieved through effective acid
suppressive therapy prior to inclusion and so it remains to be
studied how clones and diversity evolve in a Barrett’s patient with
active reflux and esophagitis, and correspondingly whether or not
diversity reaches the stable equilibrium after effective treatment
with acid-suppressive therapy. An observation in this study was
the slight decline in diversity and contraction of clones over time
that was attributable to the decrease in the size of clones that had
lost a copy of the p16-locus. Consequently, we speculate that loss
of the p16-locus provides an advantage to clones experiencing
reflux, but a disadvantage once the acid is suppressed (and so
possibly clones that undergo homologous recombination—which
were undetectable in our study and could involve duplicating an
inactivated p16 copy—may experience positive selection). The
trend towards ‘genetic normalization’ could further be due to the
(microscopic) mucosal healing associated with the effects of
longstanding anti-reflux therapy as is achieved during follow-up
and management of patients in surveillance programs. This
perhaps explains the beneficial effects of periodic surveillance on
patient compliance to therapy and thus the progression risk,
which tends to be lower than expected in surveyed cohorts.
Moreover, this line of reasoning highlights that the evolutionary
dynamics (and indeed genetic markers thereof) may be different
in patients who receive acid-suppressive therapy compared with
those who do not. Nevertheless, our data suggest that an
increased risk of progression of a Barrett’s lesion is determined
early (Fig. 5). The emergence of altered clones 24–48 months
prior to the progression in the Seattle cohort28 is comparable to
the high diversity status of future progressors and the average
progression interval in our cohort, and therefore it is possible that
cancer risk is mediated by the acquisition of genetic instability
early in lesion development. Longer follow-up is required to
confirm very-long-term evolutionary stasis and invariance of
cancer risk.
Our observation has obvious and important consequences for
clinical surveillance of the large cohorts of low-risk Barrett’s
patients; principally that an increased risk of cancer is invariant
over a period of at least 3–4 years and can be determined from a
single diversity measurement using specific markers. Our data
shed light on the evolutionary dynamics of progression to cancer
in BE. Rather than the previous stepwise-model of sequential
clonal expansions that sweep to fixation, driving other clones
extinct30, our data support the co-existence of multiple clones17
in which new clones are regularly spawned but undergo minimal
clonal expansion, and often go extinct (Fig. 5). The p16 locus is
frequently involved in the rare large clonal expansions that do
occur, suggesting a special role for this locus in disease aetiology,
but was not found to predict cancer progression. Indeed, our
results suggest that among the seven markers we examined, only
losses at the p16 locus experienced consistent clonal selection.
Only when the correct combination of genetic events occurs will a
cancer develop: the lack of prior clonal sweeps implies that
progression may be a ‘punctuated’ event that requires the ‘lucky’
acquisition of a complete set of genetic changes by a single (small)
clone, either in one catastrophic event or sequentially, in an
otherwise evolutionary quasi-static cell population.
Our longitudinal study reveals a new picture of the dynamics of
carcinogenesis in BE where the clonal make-up and evolutionary
trajectory of the lesion is predetermined from the outset.
Recognizing that only a subset of non-dysplastic Barrett’s are
‘born to be bad’ offers new hope for effective risk stratification of
this challenging patient group. These novel measures need to be
based on universal biomarkers measuring the evolutionary
dynamics of neoplasms.
Methods
Patient data. Between 2002 and 2013, we performed a prospective cohort study in
which patients were recruited from one academic medical centre and six general
hospitals in the Netherlands. Criteria for the inclusion were: (a) age 418 years,
(b) endoscopic evidence of BE, (c) presence of specialized intestinal metaplasia
without dysplasia in biopsies of the baseline endoscopy, (d) no history of HGD or
EAC or prior endoscopic therapy for BE and (e) no endoscopic features of active
reflux esophagitis. All patients that developed dysplasia or EAC within 6 months
from the index endoscopy were excluded from the study. The Medical Ethics
Committee of the Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam approved the study and
all patients provided written informed consent. All patients underwent endoscopic
surveillance every 2–3 years in adherence to the international guidelines6,24.
Endoscopic findings from all participants were registered in a central database
along with the endoscopic and pathology reports, and clinical data including sex,
age, circumferential Barrett’s segment length, BMI, use of proton-pump inhibitors,
family history of BE and/or EAC, and smoking. During the baseline and
subsequent follow-up endoscopies, a cytology specimen was obtained from the
Barrett’s mucosa for genetic evaluation by a single-cell-based analysis using DNA
FISH. Patients were considered progressors when they developed HGD or EAC
during follow-up. Follow-up time was defined as the time from the baseline
endoscopy to the date of the most recent surveillance endoscopy or to the date of
the endoscopy based on which patients were diagnosed with HGD or EAC. Patient
data are summarized in Supplementary Data 1.
Brushes and biopsies. Samples for FISH analysis were taken from the whole
Barrett’s segment using a standard endoscopic cytology brush (Cook Endoscopy,
Winston-Salem, NC). Prior to brushing, a mucolytic agent (acetylcysteine,
50 mg ml � 1) was applied to dissolve the mucus layer. Brushes were stored in
PreservCyt solution (Hologic, Marlborough, MA) and concentrated in 3 ml by
removal of the supernatant after centrifugation. Following the cytospin procedure
(Shandon Cytospin 4, Cytocentrifuge, Thermo, Waltham, MA), the cells were
concentrated on a slide in a uniform monolayer and stored at � 80 �C until further
processing for FISH analysis.
Biopsies were then taken for pathological evaluation following the Seattle
protocol (four-quadrant biopsies every 2 cm, together with the targeted biopsies of
any visible lesions). Each biopsy was evaluated for the degree of dysplasia according
to the Vienna classification31. Cases of dysplasia or EAC reported by the local
pathologist were reviewed by two pathologists who were part of a central expert
pathology panel.
FISH. We selected seven markers, split in two panels of four markers, out of 12
from a larger panel based on the existing literature on biomarkers on Barrett’s,
including karyotyping, CGH, LOH data32. FISH was performed using fluorescent
locus-specific and chromosomal centromeric (CEP) probes (Abbott Molecular).

(9p21) and set 2 comprising CEP7, CEP17, 20q (20q13.2) and MYC (8q24.12).
A fluorescent microscope (Olympus BX61) equipped with specific band filters was
used to evaluate the slides. Signal patterns were recorded for consecutive interphase
nuclei of non-squamous, non-inflammatory cells (attempted to count 100 cells per
probe set). For each individual cell the copy number of each of the four loci was
recorded by manual counting by an experienced FISH technician (C.T.L.) who was
blinded to the clinical and histological findings.
A second brushing was performed in three patients, using a new clean brush,
immediately after the first brush was taken. FISH analysis was performed as per all
other brushes. To check for consistency in the FISH signals, the diversity from set 1
and set 2 measured in the first brush was compared with the second brush using
the resampling method described in the ‘Sampling Bias Analysis’ section below.
All single-cell FISH measurements are reported in Supplementary Data 2 and
illustrative pictures are shown in Supplementary Fig. 16.
Minimum cell number. To determine the minimum acceptable number of cells to
accurately describe per-sample statistics (for example, a clonal diversity measure)
we performed a bootstrap simulation. 1,000 random subsamples of size ns cells
(possible ns values: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90) were made by sampling
without replacement from the total of nt cells. We then, for each statistic evaluated,
we calculated the mean and s.d. across the 1,000 bootstrap replicates as a function
of the sample size ns. The variance of most statistics stabilized when 50 cells or
more were included and we thus analysed only the samples with at least 50 scored
cells (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Prognostic markers. We evaluated ‘individual markers’ as the percentage of
analysed cells with an analysis were expressed as the percentage of cells in a sample
representing the individual genetic abnormalities, which included p53 loss, p16 loss,
Her-2/neu gain, 20q gain, MYC gain and aneusomy (defined by the mean of the
percentage of cells with abnormal CEP17 in both sets and the percentage of cells
with abnormal CEP7).
To evaluate per cell variables; p53 LOH was defined as cells in which the copy
number of the p53 locus was inferior to 2 or to the copy-number of centromere 17.
The biggest clone size was defined by multiplying the frequency of the most
prominent non-normal genotype (for example, max (pi)) by the circumferential
(C) length of the BE segment.
Diversity measures were analysed to quantify clonal diversity within the
Barrett’s segment. Clones were defined as the collection of cells with the same
genotype, itself defined by the combination of probe-specific copy numbers. The
number of cells observed in a particular sample was denoted as N, the number of
genotypes (different clones) observed in the sample as R, and their frequency
within the sample as the set {pi}, and the genotype of kth locus in the ith cell as aik.
The Shannon and Simpson diversity indices take into account the number of
different clones as well as the abundance of each clone.
The Shannon index is given by:
S ¼
XR
i¼1 pi ln pi
ð Þ;
ð1Þ
The Simpson index, which places a greater weight on the more abundant clones, is
calculated as: S0¼ PR
i¼1 p2
i ;
The average pairwise genetic divergence is a distance metric and is qualitatively
different from the Shannon, Simpson and number of clones statistics. Rather than
measuring the number and abundance of clones, it estimates the time since cells
shared a common ancestor, based on how much they have genetically diverged
from each other. It is calculated as:

The number of different clones observed in a sample (Nc) was normalized to the
total number of cells in the sample (Nc/N), since the more cells that are assayed, the
greater the chance of observing a new clone. In contrast to Simpson’s index, this
statistic places a greater weight on the less abundant clones. In addition to the
diversity measures computed on the genotypes defined by whole probe sets, we also
calculated single-probe Shannon diversity indices, taking into account only a single
locus at a time.
Sampling bias analyses. We first proceeded to assess our ability to reliably
observe large clonal expansions and contractions for all clones present at baseline
in samples with multiple time points. For each clone i present in a sample s, we
proceeded to a binomial test using the binom.test standard R function, defining the
following: pi, the probability that any cell at time point 1 is of clone i; xi, the
number of observations of i at the second time point; ns, the number of cells scored
for s at the second time point.
The second resampling analysis concerned the relation between sampling bias
and the measurement of diversity over time. For each sample with multiple time
points, we pooled all cells scored at both time points. For each sample s and time
point t, we drew nt, the number of scored cells for sample s at time point t, at
random from the pool of clones and computed the resulting diversity measure
(Shannon and Simpson indices, number of clones per cell, average pairwise
divergence). The process was repeated 1,000 times to create a background genetic
diversity distribution for each endoscopic brush. For each sample, we produced the
distribution of pairwise differences between all resampled t2 diversity indices
minus all resampled t1 indices. A Z score was then attributed to the difference in
diversity observed in the real data compared with the resampled difference
distribution; a resulting P value was computed assuming a normal distribution.
Finally, the resampled distribution of each diversity measure was used to assess
the reliability of the diversity-based classifications presented in Supplementary
Table 4. On the basis of the selected threshold for stratification (above median or
top 25% of t1 observation to define high risk), we computed the frequency at which
each patient would switch category.
We analysed both probe sets with the same methodologies and used Bonferroni
correction for multiple testing. For the sample that had both a pre- and post-
progression time point, we used the pre-progression time point for both analyses.
Rate of clonal expansion. For each clone i in a patient p with two time points, we
defined the growth rate gi and length-normalized growth Gi rate of all clonal
expansions using the following formulas:
gi ¼ fi2 � fi1
ð
Þ=tbb
ð3Þ
Gi ¼ gi�2pCp�re
ð4Þ
where fi1 is the frequency of clone i in patient p at the first time point, fi2 its
frequency at the second time point, tbb the time between the brushes and Cp the
circumferential length of the Barrett’s segment in patient p. re represents the
average radius of the adult human oesophagus and was set to 1.2 cm.
Clonal expansion may only occur at the clone boundary meaning that the clone
will grow quadratically. Therefore we have that:
N t
ð Þ ¼ 1 þ lt=2
ð
Þ2
ð5Þ
Where N(t) is the percentage size of the clone at time t, and we solved for the
quadratic growth rate l (% cells per year) using the clone abundances at the two
time points (Supplementary Table 2).
