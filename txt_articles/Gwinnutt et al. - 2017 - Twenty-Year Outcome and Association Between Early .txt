Objective. To describe the outcome in patients with
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) over 20 years from symptom
onset, and to assess the association between early treat-
ment
(with
disease-modifying
antirheumatic
drugs/
steroids) and mortality and disability during follow-up.
Methods. Patients recruited to the Norfolk Arthri-
tis Register (NOAR) between 1990 and 1994 who met the
2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League
Against Rheumatism RA criteria at baseline were included
in this analysis. Demographic and clinical variables were
collected at baseline and at years 1–3, 5, 7, 10, 15, and 20.
Disease activity (swollen joint count [SJC]/tender joint
count [TJC]), disability (Health Assessment Questionnaire
disability index [HAQ DI]), and mortality over 20 years
were determined. Associations between treatment group
(early treatment [ET], treatment £6 months after symptom
onset; late treatment [LT], treatment >6 months after
symptom onset; never treatment [NT], no treatment) and
mortality and disability were assessed using weighted pooled
logistic regression and weighted multilevel mixed-effects
linear regression, respectively. Inverse weights were used to
account for confounding by indication and censoring.
Results. This study included 602 patients with RA
(median age 56 years [interquartile range 44–68 years];
65.9% women). The median SJCs and TJCs were low dur-
ing the follow-up period (1–3 swollen joints and 3–6 tender
joints). The median HAQ DI score increased after year 1
but remained at low/moderate levels (median 1.25 after
year 10). The risk of mortality was reduced in the ET and
LT groups compared with that in the NT group. The ET
group and the NT group had comparable HAQ DI scores
during the follow-up period (b 5 0.03, 95% confidence
interval [95% CI] 20.06, 0.12), while the HAQ DI score
was increased in the LT group (for LT versus NT, b 5 0.10
[95% CI 0.02, 0.17]).
Conclusion. The results of this study indicate the
importance of early treatment with regard to the long-
term outcomes in patients with RA.
Early rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a type of inflam-
matory polyarthritis, is a chronic disease primarily charac-
terized by synovial joint inflammation (1). Both conditions
(RA and inflammatory polyarthritis) may lead to progres-
sive joint destruction and premature mortality (2–5). With
appropriate therapy, however, this outcome can potentially
be ameliorated (6–8), although there are relatively few
studies investigating the long-term outcome in patients
with RA (9–16). A previous study from the UK described
the outcomes in 112 patients with RA who were recruited
between 1964 and 1966 (prevalent cases) (mean age at
symptom onset 45 years). Twenty years later, 35% of these

 patients had died, and an additional 43% of the patients
were classified as having moderate-to-high functional dis-
ability (17). The patients in this cohort were predominantly
treated with steroids, gold, and chloroquine, which were
standard treatments at that time.
Gathering new data on outcomes in the modern
era is important, because over the last 2 decades there
have been significant advances in available treatments and
strategies for the management of RA (18,19). Methotrex-
ate (MTX) has become the first-choice synthetic disease-
modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) (18), and a
number of biologic DMARDs have been introduced since
2000 (20). Previous research in patients with RA demon-
strated an association between a reduced mortality risk
and ever-exposure to MTX treatment over a mean of 6
years (6), reduced mortality risk and exposure to tumor
necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) treatment over a mean of
4.9 years (21), as well as improved functional disability
with MTX and TNFi therapy (22–25).
The aforementioned advances in treatment strat-
egy included a shift toward initiating synthetic DMARD
therapy early in the disease course, with the aim of treating
patients within a “window of opportunity” in order to
achieve maximal beneficial outcome (26,27). We previ-
ously showed that in patients with early inflammatory
arthritis who received early treatment with synthetic
DMARDs or steroids (initiation ,6 months after symp-
tom onset), the odds of having a high score ($1) on the
Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index (HAQ
DI) (28) at 5 years were comparable with the odds in
patients who never required treatment, after adjustment
for differences in disease severity between the treatment
groups. Those in whom therapy was initiated later ($6
months after symptom onset) had 2-fold increased odds of
having high HAQ DI scores compared with those who
were never treated (29). Furthermore, those treated early
showed a decrease in HAQ DI scores from baseline to
year 10, which approached significance, while those treated
later had increased HAQ DI scores at year 10 compared
with baseline, again after adjustment for differences in dis-
ease severity between groups (30). Other groups of investi-
gators have also shown the negative consequences of
delayed assessment in terms of remission rates and joint
destruction (31). However, the benefits of early treatment
have yet to be demonstrated to extend past 10 years. It is
also possible that the underlying natural history of RA
may have changed over time (32).
In the current study, we investigated the outcome
in patients with early RA over the course of 20 years,
including mortality, disease activity, and physical function.
We also examined the relationship between early synthetic
DMARD or steroid therapy and mortality risk and physi-
cal function over 20 years.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
A total of 1,098 patients with inflammatory polyarthritis
were recruited by the Norfolk Arthritis Register (NOAR)
between 1990 and 1994. Detailed information about NOAR is
presented elsewhere (33). Briefly, NOAR aimed to recruit and
follow up prospectively all incident cases of inflammatory polyar-
thritis in the former Norwich Health Authority region, Norfolk,
UK. These patients with inflammatory polyarthritis were referred
by primary care physicians (a large majority of the UK population
[99%] is registered with a primary care practice) or consultant
rheumatologists. The inclusion criteria for this analysis were as
follows: $16 years of age and $2 swollen joints for $4 weeks.
Patients were excluded if they were recruited more than 2 years
following symptom onset (76 patients were excluded). For this
analysis, only patients who met the American College of Rheuma-
tology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)
2010 criteria for RA were included (34). The criteria were applied
retrospectively to the baseline characteristics of the patients who
were included (n5 614). Patients gave written consent, and the
study was approved by the Norfolk and Norwich University Hos-
pital Local Research Ethics Committee.
Assessments. Patients were assessed at baseline and at
1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, and 20 years after registration. Patients were
assessed beyond year 5 only if they had documented swollen
joints on $2 occasions or had received DMARDs or oral corti-
costeroids by the fifth-year assessment (8 patients were excluded).
Date of birth and sex were recorded at baseline. At each assess-
ment, research nurses administered a standardized questionnaire
(including smoking status [never/former/current]). The start and
stop dates of treatment with all DMARDs and steroids were col-
lected from patients at each follow-up visit. Patients who were
receiving synthetic DMARDs or steroids before symptom onset
(n5 12) were excluded from the analysis. Patients were classified
into 1 of 3 treatment groups, with treatment being synthetic
DMARDs and steroids: the early treatment (ET) group, in which
patients received treatment #6 months after symptom onset; the
late treatment (LT) group, in which patients received treatment
.6 months after onset; and the never treatment (NT) group, in
which patients never received treatment.
Comorbidities were self-reported at and after baseline
and were coded based on the relevant chapters of the Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition and Tenth Edition
(see Supplementary File 1, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatol-
ogy web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.
40090/abstract). Once a patient reported a comorbidity, he or she
was coded as having that comorbidity throughout the remainder
of the follow-up period. Research nurses performed swollen joint
counts (SJCs) and tender joint counts (TJCs) in 51 joints, from
which 28-joint counts were derived (except at follow-up visits 5
and 7). Blood samples were obtained at baseline. Serum was
stored frozen, for determination of C-reactive protein (CRP; mg/
liter), rheumatoid factor (RF; latex agglutination test, positive cut-
off 40 units/ml), and anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide 2 (anti–CCP-
2) antibodies (tested using a Diastat Anti-CCP kit, cutoff 5 units/
ml [Axis-Shield]). Blood samples were then obtained every 5
years; in these samples, only the CRP level was determined. Dis-
ease activity was measured with the Disease Activity Score, using
ASSOCIATION OF EARLY TREATMENT OF RA WITH MORTALITY AND DISABILITY
1567
 3 variables: the number of swollen joints, the number of tender
joints, and the CRP level (35), when CRP data were available.
Outcomes. Disease activity was analyzed based on the
SJC in 51 joints and the TJC in 51 joints, as described above. All
patients were flagged with the Office for National Statistics
(ONS), the holders of the UK death register, which provided cop-
ies of death certificates including date of death and the underly-
ing cause of death. The ONS also provided age- and sex-specific
mortality rates by calendar year for the Norfolk population
(1990–2013). Patients were censored at their 20th anniversary
assessment or 20 years after symptom onset (if they did not
attend the 20th assessment), with the exception of patients who
left the country, who were censored on their departure date (7
patients with RA). At each assessment, patients completed the
British Modification of the HAQ disability index (36), a validated
self-report measure of functional disability that yields a score
from 0 (no disability) to 3 (maximum disability).
Statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to
describe baseline demographic and clinical variables. Baseline
scores were compared between treatment groups using the
Kruskal-Wallis or chi-square test, depending on the type and dis-
tribution of data.
The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated
for the cohort by comparing the observed numbers of deaths with
the expected number of deaths for the local population based on
age- and sex-specific mortality rates. Patients were included in
this analysis until death, 20 years after symptom onset, or the end
of 2013, whichever came first. The association between baseline
variables, including age, sex, SJC in 51 joints, TJC in 51 joints,
HAQ DI, CRP, RF, and anti–CCP-2, and mortality was assessed
using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. To assess
the association between treatment group and mortality, initially a
Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted for age and sex, was
used, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted. The SMR
for each treatment group was also calculated. To account for con-
founding by indication, a weighted multivariate pooled logistic
regression model was used (37,38), which produces odds ratios
(ORs) that are equivalent to hazard ratios. Covariates included
baseline measures (sex, smoking status, RF, anti–CCP-2, HAQ
DI, 51-joint SJC, 51-joint TJC, and CRP), and data for time-
varying measures where collected (HAQ DI, 51-joint SJC, 51-
joint TJC, CRP, and comorbidities).
The median 51-joint SJC, 51-joint TJC, and HAQ DI
scores and the numbers and proportions of patients receiving syn-
thetic DMARDs were determined for each time point. The rela-
tionship between treatment group and disability over 20 years
was assessed using a multilevel mixed-effects linear regression
model, which is a longitudinal regression model that allows time-
varying weights. Initially, only age and sex were controlled for
using an unweighted model. To account for confounding by indi-
cation and censoring, a weighted multivariate model was then
used, with the same covariates as those used for the pooled logis-
tic regression described above (except time-varying HAQ DI
scores).
To control for confounding by indication and censor-
ing, inverse probability weights, which account for cumulative
treatment exposure as well as censoring, were used to weight
the covariates in the regression models (see Supplementary
File 2, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site
at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40090/abstract),
using methods adapted from those described by Fewell et al (37).
Multiple imputation, using iterative chained equations (5 imputed
data sets were created) conditioned on baseline, lagged, and cur-
rent assessment variables, was used to account for missing data
on the assessments that patients attended. All regression analyses
were also performed in the total population of patients with
inflammatory polyarthritis (n5 1,000). Analysis was performed
using Stata statistical software version 13.1 (StataCorp; 2013).
RESULTS
A total of 602 patients with RA were recruited
between 1990 and 1994 and met all inclusion/exclusion cri-
teria (median symptom duration 5.4 months, interquartile
range [IQR] 2.9–9.9). The median age at symptom onset
was 56 years (IQR 44–68 years), and 397 patients (65.9%)
were women. The baseline characteristics of the patients
are shown in Table 1.
In total, 160 patients (26.6%) received treatment
within 6 months of symptom onset. Among these patients,
94 (58.8%) were prescribed sulfasalazine (SSZ), 45
(28.1%) were prescribed steroids, 8 (5.0%) were pre-
scribed MTX, and 13 (8.1%) were prescribed other
DMARDs.
Among
the
remaining
442
patients,
88
(19.9%) received their first treatment within 6–12 months,
77 (17.4%) received treatment at 1–2 years, 84 (19.0%)
received treatment $2 years after symptom onset, and 193
(43.7%) never received treatment while attending follow-
up. Male patients were more likely to receive early treat-
ment (n 5 75 [46.9%]) compared with late treatment
(n5 69 [27.7%]), and patients who received early treat-
ment had a shorter disease duration at presentation
(median 2.7 months) compared with those who received
late treatment (median 7.4 months). Patients who received
early treatment had worse clinical characteristics for all
baseline variables compared with those who received late
treatment or no treatment, except for TJCs and autoanti-
body status (Table 1). Similar results were seen when all
patients with inflammatory polyarthritis were included (for
details, see Supplementary File 3, available on the Arthritis
& Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/
doi/10.1002/art.40090/abstract).
A total of 207 patients (34.4%) were available for
the 20-year assessment. During the follow-up period, 205
patients (34.1%) left the cohort due to death, 135 (22.4%)
declined further follow-up visits, 8 (1.3%) became ineligi-
ble at year 5, and 47 (7.8%) were lost to follow-up (for
details, see Supplementary File 4, available on the Arthritis
& Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/
doi/10.1002/art.40090/abstract).
Because all patients were flagged with the ONS,
mortality data were complete for the whole cohort up to
the 20th anniversary assessment (even if follow-up ceased),
except those who left the country. During 9,774 person-
1568
GWINNUTT ET AL
 years of follow-up (mean 14.8 years), 265 patients (44.0%)
died. The age- and sex-standardized SMR for the cohort
of patients with RA was increased compared with that for
the general population in the Norfolk area (SMR 1.25
[95% CI 1.11, 1.42]). In a multivariate Cox regression anal-
ysis, older age at symptom onset (hazard ratio [HR] 1.10
per increased year of age at onset [95% CI 1.08, 1.11]) and
male sex (HR 1.47 [95% CI 1.13, 1.92]) were associated
with increased risk of death during that time period. Being
a current smoker at baseline was independently associated
with an increased risk of death compared with never smok-
ers (HR 1.65 [95% CI 1.17, 2.33]) and former smokers
(HR 1.82 [95% CI 1.34, 2.45]).
In total, 88 (55.0%) of the patients who received
early treatment died over the course of follow-up compared
with 99 (39.8%) of the patients who received late treatment
and 78 (40.4%) of those who received no treatment. The
SMR was increased in the ET group (SMR 1.28 [95% CI
1.03, 1.59]) and the LT group (SMR 1.23 [95% CI 1.01,
1.51]), and there was a trend toward significance for the
NT group (SMR 1.25 [95% CI 0.99, 1.57]) compared with
the general population of Norfolk. Within the cohort, there
was little difference in the risk of death between treatment
groups, after adjustment for age and sex (ET versus NT,
HR 1.09 [95% CI 0.80, 1.11]; LT versus NT, HR 0.99 [95%
CI 0.73, 1.33]) (Figure 1). After weighting to account for

ASSOCIATION OF EARLY TREATMENT OF RA WITH MORTALITY AND DISABILITY
1569
 confounding by indication, the association between time to
first treatment and mortality risk remained nonsignificant
for the ET group, although there was a trend toward re-
duced risk of mortality (ET versus NT, adjusted OR
[ORadj] 0.78 [95% CI 0.54, 1.11]; LT versus NT, ORadj 0.66
[95% CI 0.47, 0.92]). When all patients with inflammatory
polyarthritis were included (n5 1,000), the results were
similar (ET versus NT, ORadj 0.82 [95% CI 0.61, 1.11]; LT
versus NT, ORadj 0.78 [95% CI 0.59, 1.03]).
Table 2 shows the median disease activity and func-
tional disability scores over follow-up for the patients with
RA, stratified by treatment group. All patients were
included in the analysis up to the point of their last follow-
up visit. The median SJCs and TJCs decreased rapidly in
the first year after baseline (median 11 swollen joints and
14 tender joints at baseline) and remained low throughout
follow-up (median SJC range 1–3, and median TJC range
3–6). Median HAQ DI scores for the total RA cohort also
declined initially but then increased from the year 2 assess-
ment onward, culminating in a median score higher than
the baseline score after year 7 (median HAQ DI score of
1.25 after year 10 [IQR 0.50–2.00]) (Figure 2). The propor-
tion of patients receiving synthetic DMARDs was higher
in the ET group compared with the LT group until assess-
ment 2, after which time the proportions were comparable
(55–65%) (Table 2). Only a small proportion of patients
received biologic DMARDs during the study (7.6%), and
these patients were evenly distributed between the ET
group and the LT group (19 [11.9%] of 160 patients in the
ET group, and 27 [10.8%] of 249 patients in the LT
group). Similar trends were observed when all patients
with inflammatory polyarthritis were included, although
with lower median scores due to lower disease severity in
this group (see Supplementary File 3, available on the
Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.
wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40090/abstract).
Swollen and tender joint counts were similar
between treatment groups over the follow-up period,
excluding the baseline assessment. However, functional
disability was consistently higher in patients who received
treatment compared with patients who did not (Table 2).
After controlling for age and sex, there was an asso-
ciation between being prescribed treatment and increased
HAQ DI scores over follow-up (Table 3). When the model
was fully adjusted and inverse probability weights were
applied to account for confounding by indication, patients
in the ET group had HAQ DI scores during follow-up sim-
ilar to those in the NT group (for ET versus NT, b 5 0.03
[95% CI 20.06, 0.12]), whereas those in the LT group had
significantly higher disability scores over follow-up (LT
versus NT, b 5 0.10 [95% CI 0.02, 0.17]). Similar results
were observed when all patients with inflammatory polyar-
thritis were included in the analysis.

 modern era treated according to best practice at the time of
presentation, and the second pertains to the benefit of early
treatment, which is still apparent into the second decade
after symptom onset with respect to functional disability.
Median SJCs and TJCs decreased after baseline
and remained low during the follow-up period. Median
functional disability decreased initially but then increased
over time to above baseline levels by year 7 and then con-
tinued to increase up to year 20. Kapetanovic et al followed
183 Swedish patients with early RA for 20 years and
showed a similar HAQ DI trajectory, with mean HAQ DI
scores increasing to .1.0 at year 10 and thereafter (13).
This level of functional disability is higher than that
reported in healthy individuals of a similar age. In a ran-
dom sample of adults in central Finland, the mean HAQ
DI scores for all groups of individuals younger than age 75
years were ,0.5 (39). Similar results were observed in a
random sample of individuals older than age 65 years in
Augsburg and Aichach-Friedberg, Germany (only 22.5%
of the cohort had an HAQ DI score of $0.5) (40).
Despite the increase in median HAQ DI scores
over 20 years, these results are encouraging. An HAQ DI
score of 1.38 represents low to moderate disability (41). In
contrast, a study that recruited 112 patients with RA in
Droitwich, UK from 1964 to 1966 and followed them for a
similar time period showed much higher levels of disability
at 20 years (17). It thus appears that long-term disability in
RA patients is now less severe. Furthermore, although the
proportion of patients who died was similar in the
Droitwich and NOAR studies, patients in the NOAR
cohort had an older mean age at symptom onset (56 years
versus 45 years in the Droitwich cohort).

 The second finding from this study relates to the
benefits of early DMARD therapy. We previously showed
that treatment within the first 6 months following symptom
onset is associated with benefits in physical function at 5
and 10 years, after appropriate adjustment for differences
in disease severity (29,30). In the current analysis, we
observed that, after adjustment for confounding by indica-
tion (i.e., adjusting for demographic and disease factors
that may have influenced the decision to start DMARD or
steroid treatment at baseline or subsequently), patients
who were treated early had levels of disability over the
follow-up period that were similar to those in patients who
did not receive treatment, while patients treated later had
significantly higher levels of disability over 20 years. This
supports the importance of the “window of opportunity”
construct for treatment, showing that early treatment leads
to improved outcomes even into the second decade follow-
ing symptom onset. Increased functional disability over
time could be attributable to worse joint damage (42,43),
and it has been shown that patients who receive later treat-
ment have higher radiologic scores at follow-up compared
with those treated early (8,44,45).
The SMRs for the total population and for the 2
treatment groups were elevated. The SMR for those who
were never treated was increased to a similar extent but
failed to reach significance. There was a trend toward
reduced mortality risk in the ET group and a significant
reduction in mortality risk in the LT group compared with
the NT group. Treatment with MTX has previously been
shown to be associated with a reduced medium-term risk
of mortality in RA patients (6), and we previously showed
that having disease in remission at least once within the
first 3 years of follow-up was associated with reduced mor-
tality risk in patients with inflammatory polyarthritis com-
pared with the risk in patients who never achieved
remission within the first 3 years of follow-up (median of
7.9 years) (46). It is the nature of the SMR that it
approaches 1.00 as the length of follow-up increases,
because all patients will eventually die.
This analysis has a number of strengths. It is one of
the largest inception cohorts of patients with RA and
inflammatory polyarthritis with a 20-year follow-up period.
By retrospectively applying the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria
for RA (34), we have been able to study the subgroup of
patients classified as having RA according to the latest cri-
teria and compare their results with those of patients in the
whole NOAR cohort and other published RA cohorts. The
use of inverse probability weights to a longitudinal regres-
sion model allows us to control for confounding by indica-
tion over time. This is the current state-of-the art approach
in terms of controlling for confounding by indication and
differs from approaches used in our previous work (28,29).
The attrition rates in this cohort are to be expected
over a 20-year follow-up period. The use of inverse proba-
bility of censoring weights minimizes attrition bias.
Because SJCs and TJCs were not determined at follow-up
visits 5 and 7, these time points could not be included in
the longitudinal analyses. However, because we assessed a
majority of these patients at assessments 3 and 10, patient
disability should be modeled sufficiently.
A surprisingly high proportion of patients (32.1%)
never received DMARDs or steroids. This reflects the fact
that patients were recruited from primary and secondary
care settings and followed up regardless of disease severity.
If the study had been entirely based on continuing follow-
up in secondary care, then patients with mild disease
would have been discharged and contributed no follow-up
information. Our study shows that patients who never
received DMARD treatment did well and served as a use-
ful group with which to compare the groups of patients
who were treated either early or late.
Finally, these patients were recruited more than
20 years ago, meaning that the standard treatment at
that time does not reflect best treatment practices today.
Although this is a limitation, treatment practices are
constantly evolving. If we wish to understand the 20-
year outcome in RA patients, the only method is to
study patients who were exposed to the treatment strat-
egies used 20 years ago. Nevertheless, these results are
still important, because they show clear improvement in
these patients compared with patients studied in the
prior 20-year period and also show that early treatment
with predominantly SSZ or steroids is associated with
improved outcomes 20 years later. Thus, because MTX
is considered a more effective treatment than SSZ, the
benefits of early treatment with MTX may be even
greater after 20 years.
In conclusion, this cohort of RA patients had rel-
atively low median levels of disease activity from year 1
onward. In contrast, the median level of disability
increased to above baseline levels after 7 years. This dis-
ability is still moderate. Thus, on average, patients expe-
rienced relatively good long-term outcomes, particularly
compared with those observed in an earlier UK cohort
recruited from 1964 to 1966 and followed up for 20
years. As might be expected, early therapy was given to
patients with more severe disease. After adjustment for
this confounding by indication over time, functional dis-
ability was greater in the LT group compared with the
NT group over the course of follow-up, while the ET
group had levels of disability similar to those in the NT
group, indicating that the benefits of early treatment
were sustained long term.
