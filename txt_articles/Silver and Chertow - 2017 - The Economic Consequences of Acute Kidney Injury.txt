Introduction
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication 
that affects as many as one in 5 hospitalized patients, de-
pending on the definition employed [1–3]. In-hospital 
mortality for patients with AKI has recently been esti-
mated between 20 and 25% [3, 4], and critically ill patients 
with dialysis-requiring AKI experience mortality rates in 
excess of 50% [5, 6]. For patients who survive an episode 
of AKI, long-term risks include chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) [7], end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [7], cardiovas-
cular events [8], and reduced quality of life [9]. In one 
study of 415 survivors of dialysis-requiring AKI, one in 
4 patients reported health-related quality of life equal to 
or worse than death [10].
Owing to these poor outcomes in terms of health and 
the patient experience, AKI has emerged as a major pub-
lic health concern. The third pillar of the Institute for 
Healthcare Improvement Triple Aim is the cost of health-
care, with AKI-related costs likely to increase in the future 
as the incidence of AKI increases, with no effective thera-

Abstract
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an increasingly common condi-
tion associated with poor health outcomes. Combined with 
its rising incidence, AKI has emerged as a major public health 
concern with high human and financial costs. In England, the 
estimated inpatient costs related to AKI consume 1% of the 
National Health Service budget. In the United States, AKI is 
associated with an increase in hospitalization costs that 
range from $5.4 to $24.0 billion. The most expensive patients 
are those with AKI of sufficient severity to require dialysis, 
where cost increases relative to patients without AKI range 
from $11,016 to $42,077 per hospitalization. Even with these 
high costs, significant hospital-level variation still exists in 
the cost of AKI care. In this article, we review the economic 
consequences of AKI for both the general and critically ill AKI 
population. Our primary objective is to shed light on an op-
portunity for hospitals and policymakers to develop new 
care processes for patients with AKI that have the potential 
to yield substantial cost savings. By exposing the high rates 
of death and disability experienced by affected patients and 
the immense financial burden attributable to AKI, we also 
hope to motivate scientists and entrepreneurs to pursue a 
variety of innovative therapeutic strategies to combat AKI in 
the near term.

peutic interventions currently available or in the foresee-
able future [11]. This review will demonstrate the eco-
nomic consequences of AKI, with the objective to stimu-
late new prevention and treatment strategies for this 
common condition.
Cost Estimates in the General AKI Population
Most cost estimates come from single center studies of 
academic hospitals. Chertow et al. [12] examined costs 
associated with in-hospital changes in serum creatinine 
over an 8-month period at Brigham and Women’s Hos-
pital. Relative to no AKI, the additional costs attributed 
to in-hospital AKI ranged from $7,469 for a greater than 
25% change in serum creatinine to $33,161 for a greater 
than 177 µmol/L change in serum creatinine (in 1998 
USD). When adjusted for age, sex, admission diagnosis, 
severity of illness, and CKD, the same definitions of AKI 
were associated with $3,721 and $22,023 excess hospital 
costs, respectively. A study at the same academic center 
conducted 10 years later found similar results [2]. Defin-
ing AKI using Kidney Disease Improving Global Out-
comes (KDIGO) serum creatinine criteria, AKI was as-
sociated with a $7,082 increase in costs. Estimates ranged 
from $5,400 for KDIGO stage 1 to $27,300 for KDIGO 
stage 3, with similar multivariable adjustment as Chertow 
et al. [12].
Other cost estimates that used serum creatinine cri-
teria to define AKI have been limited to specialized pa-
tient populations. In surgical patients at the University 
of Florida, the risk-adjusted average cost of care for pa-
tients undergoing surgery was $26,700 without AKI 
and $42,600 with any AKI. Patients with RIFLE-R AKI 
had an additional cost of $10,700, those with RIFLE-I 
AKI had an additional cost of $21,400, and patients 
with RIFLE-F AKI had an additional cost of $38,200 
compared with patients with no AKI [13]. Similar re-
sults were observed in a University of Pittsburgh cohort 
of cardiac surgery patients. Relative to age- and 
APACHE III-matched controls, patients with RIFLE-R 
AKI yielded an additional cost of $11,234, those with 
RIFLE-I AKI yielded an additional cost of $20,461, and 
patients with RIFLE-F AKI yielded an additional cost of 
$34,155 [14].
A limitation of these studies is that medical care in ac-
ademic centers tends to be more expensive than the same 
care in community hospitals [15]. Kerr et al. [16] used 
routine national data for the National Health Service 
(NHS) in England to estimate the cost of AKI-related care 
throughout the entire country. After multiple sensitivity 
analyses for the prevalence of AKI, the estimated inpa-
tient costs related to AKI ranged from £894,193,943 ($1.4 
billion USD) to £1,153,732,733 ($1.8 billion USD), or ap-
proximately £1,100 ($1,700 USD) per episode of AKI. 
This amount was just over 1% of the NHS budget in 2010–
2011. Lower estimates outside of academic centers were 
also found in a study of 23 Massachusetts hospitals, where 
patients with complicated AKI (AKI requiring mechani-
cal ventilation or an intensive care unit) were excluded 
[17]. Patients with AKI incurred median direct hospital 
costs of $2,600, which still exceeded costs for asthma 
($1,400), gastrointestinal bleed ($2,100), pneumonia 
($2,100), and heart failure ($2,200). Non-academic hos-
pitals incurred 17% lower AKI-related costs compared to 
academic hospitals.
To determine costs related to AKI in a representative 
population across the United States, Silver et al. [18] used 
data from the National Inpatient Sample, which contains 
administrative data for over 7 million hospitalizations 
from 95% of the United States population. AKI was asso-
ciated with an increase in hospitalization costs of $7,933, 
which decreased to $1,795 when adjusted for patient and 
hospital characteristics. Compared to other acute medical 
conditions, adjusted mean increases in the cost of a hos-
pitalization for AKI were similar to hospitalizations for 
stroke, acute pancreatitis, and pneumonia. Important 
variation existed in hospital determinants of cost. Non-
academic hospitals incurred 16% lower AKI-related costs 
compared to academic hospitals, small hospitals incurred 
9% lower costs than large hospitals, and the West census 
region incurred 31% lower costs than the South census 
region. Similar to the other multicenter studies above, Sil-
ver et al. [18] used ICD-9 codes to ascertain AKI, which 
identify patients with moderate to severe AKI rather than 
those with mild AKI [19]. Despite not fully accounting for 
mild AKI, the estimated inpatient costs related to AKI in 
the United States still ranged from $5.4 to $24.0 billion.
Cost Estimates in Patients with Dialysis-Requiring AKI
The most expensive patients are those with AKI of suf-
ficient severity to require dialysis. Fischer et al. [17] found 
that dialysis increased costs by 63%, and Silver et al. [18] 
showed that the additional costs attributed to dialysis-re-
quiring AKI ranged from $11,016 to $42,077. These costs 
suggest that a small percentage of patients with AKI ac-
count for 20–25% of the incremental AKI-related hospi-
tal costs.

Many of these high cost patients are critically ill. The 
critical care literature has largely focused on cost differ-
ences between intermittent hemodialysis and continuous 
renal replacement therapy (CRRT), which is approxi-
mately a few hundred dollars per day more expensive 
with CRRT [20, 21]. Regardless of the modality selected, 
multiple studies have demonstrated that the provision of 
dialysis in critically ill patients adds between $28,000 and 
$56,035 with variation related to acute dialysis practice 
patterns between centers [21–23].
More important than modality selection is the cost-
effectiveness of providing any type of dialysis for criti-
cally ill patients. In the SUPPORT study, Hamel et al. 
[22] followed 490 patients in whom dialysis was initiat-
ed. The estimated cost per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) saved by initiating dialysis and continuing ag-
gressive care rather than withholding dialysis and allow-
ing death to occur was $128,200. Cost-effectiveness var-
ied by estimated survival probability; patients in the 
worst prognostic category (≤10% survival) had a cost

per QALY saved of $274,100, and patients in the best 
prognostic category (41–60% survival) had a cost per 
QALY saved of $61,900. Laukkanen et al. [23] added a 
societal perspective (e.g., long-term disability costs) to 
their cost-effectiveness analysis in 410 patients with di-
alysis-requiring AKI. Overall, cost per QALY saved was 
poor ($271,116). Cost-effectiveness decreased with in-
creasing age, exceeding $750,000 per QALY for patients 
over 65 years of age. However, cost effectiveness ap-
proached the commonly cited threshold of $50,000 per 
QALY for patients who survived for more than a year 
and did not require chronic dialysis ($37,172). These re-
sults suggest that dialysis in critically ill patients may be 
cost-effective under certain circumstances, but depends 
on recovery of kidney function and post-discharge sur-
vival, which are difficult outcomes for clinicians to pre-
dict a priori.
Few studies outside of the intensive care unit have ac-
counted for CKD, ESRD, and other long-term outcomes 
in their cost analyses. Kerr et al. [16] constructed a Mar-
kov model to estimate long-term costs arising from CKD 
and ESRD in patients who have had AKI relative to a 
matched group without AKI. They found that post-dis-
charge care for patients with AKI cost the NHS an addi-
tional £179 million ($277 million USD) relative to 
matched controls, but their estimate was very sensitive to 
small changes in the incidence of long-term (mainte-
nance) dialysis therapy. More research is needed to better 
quantify the costs associated with post-discharge AKI 
care.
Conclusions
Several studies now indicate that AKI is expensive and 
consumes considerable healthcare resources (Table 1). 
While it is difficult to fully determine which downstream 
costs are attributable to AKI rather than a coexisting di-
agnosis, even the most conservative estimates still attri-
bute approximately $1,700 in excess costs for each epi-
sode of AKI and $11,000 in excess costs for each episode 
of dialysis-requiring AKI. In the United States, at least $5 
billion in hospital costs are related to AKI, and the true 
costs are likely much, much higher. These estimates only 
account for the inpatient costs of AKI, and ignore AKI 
that occurs in a primary care setting and the long-term 
consequences of an AKI episode. Further work is also 
needed to better understand hospital-level differences in 
AKI care and patient experiences that influence the deci-
sion to initiate renal replacement therapy.
Despite the economic and health consequences of 
AKI, there have been very few innovations in the pre-
vention and management of AKI over the last decade. In 
the United Kingdom, a report by the National Confi-
dential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death found 
that 30% of AKI cases were avoidable and only 50% of 
patients received good care [24]. Small improvements in 
these numbers could yield substantial cost-savings, 
which is one of the goals of the NHS Think Kidneys 
quality improvement program [25]. Similar commit-
ment is required in other jurisdictions to help improve 
patient outcomes and the patient experience at a reason-
able cost for the ever increasing number of patients with 
AKI.
