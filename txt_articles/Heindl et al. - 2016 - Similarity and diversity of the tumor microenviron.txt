ABSTRACT
The tumor microenvironment is pivotal in influencing cancer progression and 
metastasis. Different cells co-exist with high spatial diversity within a patient, yet 
their combinatorial effects are poorly understood. We investigate the similarity of 
the tumor microenvironment of 192 local metastatic lesions in 61 ovarian cancer 
patients. An ecologically inspired measure of microenvironmental diversity derived 
from multiple metastasis sites is correlated with clinicopathological characteristics 
and prognostic outcome. We demonstrate a high accuracy of our automated analysis 
across multiple sites. A low level of similarity in microenvironmental composition is 
observed between ovary tumor and corresponding local metastases (stromal ratio r = 
0.30, lymphocyte ratio r = 0.37). We identify a new measure of microenvironmental 
diversity derived from Shannon entropy that is highly predictive of poor overall (p = 
0.002, HR = 3.18, 95% CI = 1.51-6.68) and progression-free survival (p = 0.0036, 
HR = 2.83, 95% CI = 1.41-5.7), independent of and stronger than clinical variables, 
subtype stratifications based on single cell types alone and number of sites. Although 
stromal influence in ovary tumors is known to have significant clinical implications, 
our findings reveal an even stronger impact orchestrated by diverse cell types. 
Quantitative histology-based measures can further enable objective selection of 
patients who are in urgent need of new therapeutic strategies such as combinatorial 
treatments targeting heterogeneous tumor microenvironment.
INTRODUCTION
Ovarian cancer is the most fatal gynecological 
malignancy [19, 36]. Approximately 75% of patients have 
metastatic diseases at diagnosis [15], and survival rate for 
International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics 
(FIGO) stage III-IV ovarian cancer ranges from 25% to 
37% [43]. The vast majority (70-80%) of ovarian cancer 
deaths are from high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSOC) 
with hardly any change in overall survival in the past 
years [6]. This is partly due to the distinctive biology of 
HGSOC: the lack of an anatomical barrier in the peritoneal 
cavity to cancer cell dissemination likely originated from 
the fallopian tube or precursor cells in the ovary [6, 22, 
24, 27, 37, 39]. 
To control this highly metastatic disease, concerted 
efforts have led to a new understanding of genetic 
heterogeneity in ovarian cancer and developments of

new targeted therapies and chemotherapy agents [2, 4, 
5, 18, 30, 33, 48, 49]. However, responses to therapies 
are often short-lived, and patients eventually relapse [51]. 
Understanding the contribution of the microenvironment 
to ovarian cancer progression will lead to the development 
of new biomarkers and provide the basis of improved 
therapeutic efficiency [4, 20, 29]. The desire to understand 
cancer-microenvironmental interactions has fuelled a 
developing interest in studying cancer from a novel 
perspective: ecology [3, 17, 23, 32, 40]. Seeing cancer 
cells as a ‘species’ disrupting the homeostasis of a 
complex ecosystems rather than just as a group of mutated 
cells [3] allows for drawing analogies to ecological 
hypothesis such as that complete eradication of a species 
is most likely impossible due to their ability to evolve 
adaptive strategies [17]. Another prominent example 
inspired by ecology is the “seed and soil” theory saying 
that in order to metastasize, the soil (microenvironment at 
the metastasis site) is as important as the seed (malignant 
cell) [34, 41]. Understanding and early interventions of 
the primary “seeds” and metastatic “soil” are required 
for better clinical management of cancer. Within a 
Darwinian framework, such analyses can reveal distinct 
microenvironments, or, the habitats of cancer, that can 
employ a number of different ecological forces driving 
tumor development and spread [14]. Studies of these 
ecological forces occurring in tumors can benefit from 
application of statistical tools routinely used in ecological 
studies. Histology samples provide an abundance of data 
as input for these methods due to preserved spatial context. 
Thus, spatial analysis empowered by large-scale analysis 
of archival histology samples could facilitate studies of 
ecological interactions in human tumors with far-reaching 
implications [23, 32].
Our previous work [25] demonstrated how fully 
automated image analysis using hematoxylin and eosin 
(H&E) slides of ovary tumors can enable the identification 
of ovarian cancer subtypes that were consistent with 
molecular subtyping previously reported [26, 48]. These 
subtypes were defined based on proportions of cells in 
histological ovary tumor sections alone: a high lymphocyte 
ratio group with good prognosis and a high stromal ratio 
group with poor prognosis [25]. However, different 
types of cells interact and co-exist with high spatial 
heterogeneity within a patient, yet the collective effect of 
cell diversity has not been studied. Besides a recent paper 
[12] where the authors observed large variations in intra-
case comparisons of stromal characteristics between ovary 
and metastases, the microenvironment of tumors other 
than those from the ovary has received little investigation. 
In this paper, we apply ecologically inspired diversity 
measurements based on Shannon entropy to assess the 
heterogeneity of microenvironments in multiple local 
metastasis sites of HGSOC, including ovary, omentum, 
peritoneum, lymph node and appendix. Our aims are: 1) 
to establish the use of automated histology analysis for 
studying multiple metastasis sites besides ovary tumors, 
2) to evaluate the similarity and ecological diversity of 
the microenvironment in these local metastases, 3) to 
understand the clinical implication of microenvironmental 
characteristics in HGSOC metastases.
RESULTS
Automated analysis of tumor microenvironment 
in local HGSOC metastases
We previously reported a high accuracy of our 
automated histological analysis system in identifying 
three major cell types (cancer cells, lymphocytes and 
stromal cells) in whole-section H&E histology samples of 
ovary tumors [25]. This system enabled the identification 
of ovarian cancer subtypes that were consistent with 
molecular subtyping previously reported [26, 48]. These 
subtypes were defined based on proportions of cells 
alone in the ovary tumors: a high lymphocyte ratio group 
with good prognosis and a high stromal ratio group with 
poor prognosis [25]. Here, we evaluated the accuracy of 
our system in analyzing H&E sections of tumors from 
other local metastases including omentum, peritoneum, 
appendix, spleen, umbilicus and lymph node using two 
approaches (Figure 1, Methods). First, we tested the 
accuracy of single-cell classification using a collection of 
4,633 single cells annotated by two pathologists that were 
not used to train the classifier (DNR and KK, Methods, 
Figure 2a). We found a good overall performance of our 
classifier compared with the pathologists’ annotations 
with high mean balanced sensitivity and specificity scores 
across sites (cancer cells 0.90, lymphocytes 0.82 and 
stromal cells 0.89, Figure 2b). Stromal cell classification 
in peritoneum has the lowest balanced average measure 
due to a higher frequency of tissue contraction artifacts 
as tissue gaps originated from formalin fixation and 
paraffin embedding procedures. Secondly, we measured 
the correlation between automated and pathologist’s cell 
proportion scores and observed a good level of correlation 
between automated and pathologist’s scores of cell 
proportions (cancer: r = 0.8, lymphocytes: r = 0.7, stromal 
cells: r = 0.9, Figure 2c). The presence of a small amount 
of normal epithelial cells in the appendix was responsible 
for misclassification as cancer cells, resulting in a lower 
correlation with the pathologist’s cancer cell proportion 
score. However, we observed in general a low amount of 
normal epithelial cells and the overall accuracy of cancer 
cell classification is high (median = 87%-96%, Figure 2b). 
We subsequently applied this automated image analysis 
tool on 192 local tumor lesions from 61 patients (Methods, 
Table 1).

Comparison of microenvironmental composition 
between ovary tumors and other local metastasis 
sites
Based on the histology image analysis results, we 
first compared the cellular composition of ovary tumors 
by examining individual cell types. We found a low 
correlation between stromal ratio measured in the ovary 
and mean stromal ratio in other local metastasis sites of 
the same patient (Pearson correlation r = 0.302, p = 0.03, 
Figure 3a, Methods). Consistent with our previous study 
[25], the high stromal ratio group, defined by dividing 
patients into two equal-size groups based on the ratio of 
stromal cells to all cells in ovary tumors, was associated 
with poor overall survival (p = 0.03, HR = 1.99, 95% 
CI = 1.07-3.72, Figure 3b; Supplementary Figure 1b) 
However, stromal ratio defined in any local site other than 
the ovary, or the mean stromal ratio of those sites were 
not prognostic (p > 0.05, Table 3, Figure 3c). A moderate 
correlation between lymphocyte ratio measured in ovary 
tumor and mean lymphocyte ratio in other metastasis sites 
of the same patient was also observed (Pearson correlation 
r = 0.369, p = 0.003, Figure 3d). Low lymphocyte ratio 
was associated with poor overall survival (p = 0.04, HR 
= 0.52, 95% CI = 0.28-0.97, Figure 3e; Supplementary 
Figure 1a). Neither lymphocyte ratio defined in any local 
site other than the ovary nor the mean lymphocyte ratio of 
these sites was prognostic (p > 0.05, Table 3, Figure 3f). 
Tumor microenvironmental diversity of ovarian 
local metastases is associated with poor overall 
and progression-free survival
To measure the collective characteristics of the 
microenvironment, we next examined tumor diversity 
measures that consider all cell types simultaneously. The 
Shannon diversity index that measures species diversity 
in an ecosystem was calculated for each tumor (Methods). 
A high score indicates diverse cell types with similar 
proportions, whilst a low score suggests dominance 
of one cell type. We first compared the distribution 
of Shannon diversity for each tumor site. Appendix

metastasis has significantly higher level of diversity 
compared with lymph node metastasis (Kruskal-Wallis 
test p = 0.008, Supplementary Figure 2a). Analysis of 
averaged cell ratios in these sites showed that lymph node 
has in general a higher proportion of lymphocytes, as 
expected (Supplementary Figure 2b). The appendix, on 
the other hand, has higher proportions of stromal cells and 
lymphocytes, which explained the high diversity score.
To measure the level of microenvironmental 
diversity for each patient, we calculated the mean of 
diversity scores in all tumors other than those from the 
ovary (MetDiv). By relating it to survival, we found that 
a high MetDiv score was associated with poor OS (p = 
0.002, hazard ratio (HR) = 3.18, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) = 1.51-6.68, Figure 4a; Supplementary Figure 1c) and

4b, Table 3; Supplementary Figure 1d). Patients with 
diverse microenvironments in metastases have 9% 5-year 
OS and 0% PFS compared with 42% and 20% respectively 
for patients with more homogenous microenvironments. 
The stability of these survival analyses was evaluated by 
random sampling of progressively fewer samples from 
100% (n = 61) to 70% (n = 42). Mean metastasis diversity 
remained prognostic over 85% of the time for univariate 
analysis (OS; Figure 4c). This confirms the stability of 
this score as a predictor for survival. In contrast, measures 
of mean diversity scores in all tumors including those 
from the ovary, microenvironmental diversity in ovary 
tumors, or variability within local metastases (standard 
deviation) were not found to be prognostic (Table 3, p > 
0.05). In addition, we compared our scores with another 
widely used ecological diversity index, the Simpson index 
(Methods). A high correlation between the two indices (r 
= 0.98, Supplementary Figure 3, Methods) was observed, 
which is consistent with previous studies that found very 
little qualitative differences between these scores [28, 
35]. We thus focused on the Shannon diversity index and 
MetDiv henceforth. Patient stratification based on MetDiv 
with respect to three cell types is illustrated in Figure 4d-
e. A shift in microenvironmental features from the low 
diversity group to the high diversity group is evident. 
Metastasis sites with low MetDiv scores contained a 
high amount of cancer cells, whereas those with highly 
diverse microenvironment shifted towards the center of 
the triangle plot due to a more diverse microenvironmental 
makeup.
Metastasis diversity is not dominated by a cell 
type or metastatic site and remains stable with 
reduced amount of tissue
Subsequently, we tested whether the prognostic 
effect of our MetDiv score was driven by dominant cell

types. When there is a dominant cell type, the Shannon 
diversity is low. Therefore a possible explanation of our 
observation is that a large amount of a single cell type 
in the metastases is responsible for a low diversity score 
and good prognosis. We then examined the distribution of 
cell types in the low and high MetDiv groups. We found 
no significant difference in the proportions of cancer 
cells, lymphocytes or stromal cells between the two 
groups (p > 0.1, Kruskal-Wallis test, Figure 4f). We next 
asked if MetDiv was driven by a specific metastasis site. 
MetDiv scores of these patients did not differ according 
to the presence of omentum, peritoneum, lymph node or 
appendix metastasis (p > 0.05, Supplementary Figure 4a-
d). We next examined the distribution of MetDiv groups 
according to clinicopathologic parameters. MetDiv was 
not associated with FIGO stage, debulking status and age 
(p > 0.05) but chemotherapy regimen (p = 0.002, Table 1). 
A factor that could influence the reliability of 
MetDiv score is the amount of tissue used for our analysis. 
To test this, we simulated the scenario that only half of 
a tumor was available and computed the MetDiv score 
based on the new data (Methods). We found that the

difference between the original and the new Shannon 
diversity score was very small (standard deviation = 
0.0016-0.0006; Supplementary Figure 5a). The prognostic 
value of MetDiv for OS and PFS based on the new scores 
remained significant (p < 0.005). We further evaluated the 
robustness of the MetDiv score by randomly sampling 
100% / 75% / 50% of cells from the whole-section images 
(Supplementary Figure 5b), revealing an even smaller 
standard deviation of the diversity score (0.0003), thereby 
supporting the stability of the MetDiv score against 
variable amount of tissue used for analysis. 
Metastasis diversity is prognostic independent of 
clinical parameters

and prognostic scores including age, debulking status,

0.03, HR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.07-3.72) and lymphocyte 
ratio in ovary tumors (p = 0.03, HR = 0.52, 95% CI = 
0.28-0.97) were associated with OS (Table 3). For PFS, 
only age grouping (p = 0.01, HR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.22-
4.53: Table 3) was prognostic. In multivariate survival 
analysis with age, stromal and lymphocyte grouping, 
we found that the MetDiv score remains statistically 
significant (OS p = 0.002, HR = 3.40, 95% CI = 1.59-7.27; 
PFS p = 0.0006, HR = 3.77, 95% CI = 1.77-8.03, Table 
3) followed by age (OS p = 0.01, HR = 2.72, 95% CI = 
1.27-5.83; PFS p = 0.0022, HR = 3.02, 95% CI = 1.48-
6.12). Stromal grouping and lymphocyte grouping were 
no longer significant (p > 0.05). The number of metastasis 
sites for each patient (OS p = 0.46, HR = 0.88 95% CI = 
0.65-1.21, PFS p = 0.436, HR = 0.90 95% CI = 0.68-1.18) 
or the presence of omentum, peritoneum, lymph node, 
appendix metastasis was not correlated with OS or PFS 
(p > 0.5, Table 3). Random sampling was again performed 
for MetDiv in multivariate analysis of OS that include age, 
stromal and lymphocyte grouping (Methods). We found 
that with more than 80% (49) samples, more than 81.3% 
of the times MetDiv remained significant, supporting its 
stability as a prognostic marker (Figure 4g).
DISCUSSION
Influences from stromal endothelial cells, immune 
regulation and cancer-associated fibroblasts were known 
to be important factors for tumor progression with roles 
in angiogenesis, inflammation and phenotype switching 
[1, 20, 52]. Prognostic subtypes directly related to 
immune or stromal components in ovary tumors have 
been consistently reported in large-scale studies of 
genomics [16, 33, 48, 49]. We have previously reported 
strong prognostic value of ovarian cancer subtypes 
based on the amount of immune or stromal infiltrate in 
ovarian tumor histological samples, where high amount 
of stromal cells was significantly associated with poor 
survival in contrast to lymphocytic infiltration which 
was found to correlate with favorable prognosis [25]. 
The most important finding in this study is that diverse 
microenvironment in multiple local metastases including 
omentum, peritoneal, lymph node and appendix is a 
novel feature of aggressive HGSOC. Its strong prognostic 
effect is independent of subtyping that consider a single 
cell type alone, microenvironmental diversity at a single 
tumor site, number of metastatic sites and standard clinical 
parameters in HGSOC. Therefore, our new study offers 
clear evidence that it is not just single cell type at play, but 
also that the collective contribution of diverse cells in the 
microenvironment parallels the acquisition of aggressive 
HGSOC phenotypes in locally advanced diseases. 
Specifically, 
HGSOC 
patients 
with 
diverse 
microenvironment or high MetDiv score in their local 
metastases have a staggering 5-year overall survival of 
9%, compared with 42% for patients with low MetDiv 
scores. Although there was a moderate degree of similarity 
in the amount of stromal cells between ovary tumors and 
other sites (Pearson correlation r = 0.302), only stromal 
cell abundance measured in ovary tumors but not in other 
sites was associated with poor overall survival in these 
locally advanced diseases (p = 0.03, HR = 1.99, CI = 1.07-
3.72). Similar conclusions were drawn in our analysis 
comparing lymphocyte abundance in ovary and other 
sites. These results underscore the clinical significance of 
stromal and lymphocyte abundance in ovary tumors but 
not in other tumor sites. 
The MetDiv score is, however, independent of 
and stronger than stromal or lymphocyte abundance in 
multivariate survival analysis (MetDiv p = 0.002, HR = 
3.40 95% CI = 1.59-7.27, age p = 0.01, HR = 2.72 95% 
CI = 1.27-5.83, stromal ratio p = 0.12, HR = 1.68, 95% 
CI = 0.88-3.21 and lymphocyte ratio p = 0.30, HR = 0.71, 
95% CI = 0.38-1.34). Debulking status is known as a key 
clinical variable for advanced ovarian cancer [7, 10, 50], 
and was found to be prognostic in our previous study that 
included patients with only ovary tumor samples (OS 
and PFS p < 0.01) [25]. However, it was not found to 
be associated with OS or PFS in the patient subset with 
more than one local metastasis under study here (p > 
0.05, Table 3). Reasons for the lack of significance can be 
either the small sample size or the now dated definition of 
optimal debulking (residual disease no larger than 1 cm in 
maximum diameter). 
Note that the MetDiv score is different from the 
ecosystem diversity index in our recent study of primary 
breast tumors [31]. Ovarian cancer is unique in its high 
metastatic potential due the lack of an anatomical barrier 
to cancer cell dissemination in the peritoneal cavity [5]. 
MetDiv thus represents an ecologically inspired measure 
that was specifically designed for the spatial analysis of 
HGSOC microenvironments, using a collection of 192 
local metastasis tumors spreading across 61 patients. 
Despite variations in background of different tumor sites 
and variable numbers of metastasis sites per patient, we 
showed that MetDiv provides a generalizable measure 
of cell diversity across multiple sites, emphasizing the 
importance of considering the cumulative effects of 
diverse cell types at multiple locations that can contribute 
to HGSOC progression. Further studies based on our 
findings may suggest novel solution to the problem of 
therapeutic resistance in HGSOC management [44, 47] 
and lead to clinical innovations in treatment strategies. 
With recent advances in immunotherapy targeting 
immune checkpoints or cytokines, combinatorial therapies 
with these new agents and anti-VEGF drugs such as 
bevacizumab [9] to target multiple components may 
be carefully considered for patients with high MetDiv 
scores to mitigate the joint effect from multiple cell types.

A further study to illuminate the complex network of 
cytokine and chemokine signaling between malignant 
cells and normal cells intertwined with growth factors 
underlying the prognostic effect of metastasis diversity 
will shed further light on this aspect. 
In summary, we demonstrated how automated 
histology analysis coupled with ecological measures 
is 
effective 
in 
characterizing 
the 
metastatic 
microenvironment in locally advanced HGSOC, leading 
to clinically significant findings. Advantages of our 
proposed method are that it utilizes objective automated 
histology analysis, widely available paraffin-embedded 
specimens and standard H&E staining methods, and we 
demonstrated that it is robust against variable amount 
of tissue ( > 50%) used for analysis. Limitations of our 
study include the lack of an independent test cohort, a two-
dimensional representation of complex tumors, no spatial 
association measured between cell types, two different 
treatment regimens, only one histologic subtype and only 
basic cell types (stromal cells, lymphocytes and cancer 
cells). Furthermore the definition of optimal surgery was 
refined over time and changed from < 1 cm to minimal/
none macroscopic residual disease [11]. Future efforts will 
focus on further validation of our automated system and 
the discrimination between different types of lymphocytes 
and stromal cells using immunohistochemistry approaches 
(e.g. fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, fibrocytes, vascular 
pericytes and endothelial cells) to further dissect the 
tumor microenvironment and consolidate their clinical 
relevance in HGSOC and other histologic subtypes as 
well as molecular profiling in independent cohorts with 
multiple sections per tumor. 
 Nevertheless, we expect that the need to understand 
the biological basis for coordinated influences from 
multiple microenvironmental cell types, and their 
concomitant effect on HGSOC treatment, will help shape 
future research on this devastating cancer type.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient selection and characteristics
All patients with ovarian carcinoma, who received 
primary debulking surgery without neoadjuvant therapy 
between May 1999 and December 2010 at Sun Yat-sen 
University Cancer Centre, China, were reviewed. A total 
of 61 patients with International Federation of Gynecology 
and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage III-IV HGSOC ovarian cancer 
with at least one locally advanced resectable metastasis 
site were identified (Table 1). Resectable metastases were 
collected during debulking surgery. In total, 192 paraffin 
embedded blocks from 7 local metastasis sites (61 ovary, 
51 omentum, 48 peritoneum, 9 appendix, 20 lymph node, 
1 spleen, 2 umbilicus; Table 2) were obtained from 61 
patients. For each patient 2-5 tumor sites were available 
(median n = 3). Patient consent and ethical approval were 
obtained by the institutional review board of Sun Yat-
sen University Cancer Centre. Paraffin-embedded tumor 
blocks were retrieved from the hospital archive. Clinical 
data including clinicopathologic characteristics, treatment 
regimen and follow-up 10-year overall survival (OS) and 
progression-free survival (PFS) were collected (Table 
1). OS was censored at the date of death or, for living 
patients, the date of last contact. PFS was censored at the 
date of death or progression, whichever occurred first, or 
the date of last contact for the patients alive and without 
recurrent disease. Progression was defined as serially 
rising CA125 levels, or any clinical or radiographic 
evidence of new lesions as either local/regional relapse 
or distant metastasis. Median OS and PFS were 43.33 
months (range 1.97-120 months) and 19.8 months (0.97-
120), respectively. All patients underwent debulking 
surgery that mainly consisted of total hysterectomy, 
salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, nodal dissection, 
or intestinal surgery followed by chemotherapy. Optimal 
debulking was considered as residual disease no larger 
than 1 cm in maximum diameter evaluated by surgeons at 
surgery [8, 38]. The majority of patients (88.6%) had 6-8 
cycles of paclitaxel/docetaxel plus carboplatin/cisplatin 
postoperatively, and 11.5% of patients received adjuvant 
chemotherapy of cyclophosphamide, bleomycin plus 
carboplatin before paclitaxel was available in China (Table 
1). 
Histology image analysis and validation
H&E histological sections of multiple metastases 
from paraffin-embedded tumor blocks were generated, 
digitalized (Aperio, 20x, 0.5µm/pixel) and analyzed using 
open source R package CRImage [53] (Figure 1). The cell 
classifier was trained based on 100 features comprised of 
mostly morphological and some textural measurements 
as described in [25]. Cells were classified based on their 
morphological differences of the nucleus positive for 
haematoxylin stain without using immunohistochemical 
target stains. Immune cells typically display small, round 
and homogeneously basophilic nuclei; cancer cells in 
general have nuclei of larger size and greater variability 
in texture and shape. Both cell types can be differentiated 
from stromal cells such as fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, 
fibrocytes, vascular pericytes and endothelial cells that 
contain more elongated nuclei. The average amount 
of cells classified in each tumor section was 362,417 
(interquartile range 208,129-502,789) for cancer cells, 
92,861 (interquartile range 39,075-106,220) for stromal 
cells and 67,433 (interquartile range 27,944-90,852) for 
lymphocytes.
Validation of the classifier on tumors other than 
those from the ovary was performed using two approaches. 
First, a total of 4,633 single-cell annotations from two 
 Oncotarget
71133
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
pathologists were collected from all six sites (cancer = 
2,668, lymphocyte = 1,120, stromal = 845; Figure 2a, 
Supplementary Figure 6). Note that this data was only used 
for testing and not for training the classifier. Subsequently, 
sensitivity and specificity as well as the balanced average 
of both were computed (Figure 2b, Supplementary 
Figure 7 and 8). The second approach was performed 
by comparing proportions of cancer cells, lymphocytes 
and stromal cells to total amount of cells in 24 randomly 
selected fields of view. The fields of view were 2000 x 
2000 square pixel images at a resolution of 0.5µm per 
pixel, representing 6 different metastasis sites each with 
four fields of view. Automated image analysis results were 
benchmarked against scores from the pathologists (DNR, 
KK) using Pearson’s correlation test. 
Tumor microenvironmental diversity measures
We quantified the ecosystem diversity for a tumor j 
using the Shannon diversity index [45]: 
 Eq.1
where  pij is the proportion of the i th cell type 
in tumor j, and R is the number of different cell types. 
A high value of the Shannon diversity index represents 
a heterogeneous environment populated by similar 
proportions of different cell types, whilst a low value 
indicates a homogeneous ecological composition. A 
known disadvantage of Shannon diversity is that it only 
accounts for species abundance and not absence [42]. We 
therefore also compared it with the Simpson diversity 
index [46]. The Simpson index of tumor j was defined as 
follows:
 Eq.2
where pij is the proportion of the i th cell type in 
tumor j and R the number of different cell types. 
Other statistical methods
Survival analysis was carried out using R. Survival 
curves were plotted according to Kaplan-Meier [21] 
method and the difference in survival was assessed using 
the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards model [13] 
was used to identify prognostic factors in univariate and 
multivariate analyses. To be considered for multivariate 
analysis, a factor had to be statistically significant (p < 
0.05) in univariate analysis. Continuous variables were 
dichotomized due to their skewed distribution (skewness 
ranging between -0.4 and 1) by employing either an 
iterative thresholding approach or if no optimal threshold 
could be found by dividing patients into two equal-size 
groups based on the median. Lymphocyte ratio was 
dichotomized into a group of lower 33% and a group of 
higher 67%, stromal ratio into a group of lower 50% and a 
group of higher 50%, both in line with our previous study 
[25]. To evaluate the proposed uni/multivariate survival 
models, progressively decreasing number of samples 
from 100% to 70% were randomly drawn 1000 times 
from the cohort without replacement, survival analysis 
was performed and log-rank test p-value was recorded. 
This was used to test the stability of the uni/multivariate 
survival model by computing the percentage of times 
where it remained statistically significant. Kruskal-Wallis 
test was used for testing association between a continuous 
variable and a categorical variable. Fisher’s exact test was 
used to test for association between categorical variables. 
Cell ratio was measured as the ratio of a cell type to 
all cells in a tumor. Variability of scores was measured 
using standard deviation. For testing the amount of 
tissue required for our analysis, we divided each section 
image into two halves horizontally or vertically, thereby 
obtaining equal sized tissue areas. New scores were 
computed using half of the tissue and compared with the 
original scores using absolute difference.
