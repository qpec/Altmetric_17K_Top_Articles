ABSTRACT
Recent studies and experience suggest that cefazolin might be equally
as effective as antistaphylococcal penicillins for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus
aureus (MSSA), with a better safety profile and lower cost. The objective of these
meta-analyses was to compare the safeties of antistaphylococcal penicillins and cefa-
zolin. The PubMed, Embase, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts databases
and websites for clinical trial registries through 23 June 2017 were searched. In addi-
tion, recent abstracts from infectious disease and pharmacy conferences were re-
viewed. We estimated Peto odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) us-
ing random-effects models. One analysis focused on hospitalized patients, and the
other focused on outpatients. Eleven retrospective studies of hospitalized patients
and three retrospective studies of outpatients were included. In hospitalized pa-
tients, lower rates of nephrotoxicity (Peto OR, 0.225; 95% CI, 0.127 to 0.513), acute
interstitial nephritis (Peto OR, 0.189; 95% CI, 0.053 to 0.675), hepatotoxicity (Peto OR,
0.160; 95% CI, 0.066 to 0.387), and drug discontinuation due to adverse reactions
(Peto OR, 0.192; 95% CI, 0.089 to 0.414) were found with cefazolin. In outpatients,
lower rates of nephrotoxicity (Peto OR, 0.372; 95% CI, 0.192 to 0.722), hepatotoxicity
(Peto OR, 0.313; 95% CI, 0.156 to 0.627), and hypersensitivity reactions (Peto OR,
0.372; 95% CI, 0.201 to 0.687) were observed with cefazolin. Compared to anti-
staphylococcal penicillins, cefazolin was associated with significant reductions in
nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity in hospitalized patients and outpatients. Addi-
tionally, cefazolin was associated with lower likelihoods of discontinuation due to
side effects in hospitalized patients and hypersensitivity reactions in outpatients.
Cefazolin should be considered a first-line option for patients with MSSA infec-
tions for which efficacy is presumed to be similar to that of antistaphylococcal
penicillin therapy.

T
he �-lactams are preferred over other classes of antibiotics for the treatment of
infections caused by methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (1–3).
Typically, antistaphylococcal penicillins are recommended as first-line agents, while
cefazolin is recommended as a second-line alternative (1–3). Concerns that have been
raised with cefazolin include the limited studies of and experience with its use for
serious MSSA infections, its unnecessarily broad spectrum of activity due to additional
Gram-negative coverage, the possibility of greater susceptibility to hydrolysis by some
�-lactamases (especially type A), and an inoculum effect resulting in potentially higher
rates of treatment failure in deep-seated MSSA infections (4–10).
In recent years, there have been increases in both clinical experience and the
number of reported studies involving cefazolin treatment for MSSA infections, leading
to switching to cefazolin as a first-line agent in many institutions. Cefazolin contains less
sodium, requires lower volumes of diluent, and is available for use as a rapid bolus

 injection, while antistaphylococcal penicillins need to be administered by slow intra-
venous infusion because of the risk of extravasation (11). Also, cefazolin can be dosed
less frequently than antistaphylococcal penicillins (every 8 h [q8h] versus q4h to q6h,
respectively) in patients with normal kidney function, it can be dosed much less
frequently in patients on hemodialysis (due to adjustment for renal dysfunction),
and it is much less expensive than antistaphylococcal penicillins.
Despite these potential advantages of cefazolin, most previous studies involving
cefazolin and antistaphylococcal penicillins had relatively small sample sizes. Therefore,
we conducted meta-analyses to compare the safety of cefazolin to that of antistaphy-
lococcal penicillins in hospitalized patients and outpatients.
RESULTS
Search results. The database search process identified 475 articles; 11 (12–22) were
included in the analysis of hospitalized patients, and 3 (23–25) were included in the
analysis of outpatients (Fig. 1).
Study characteristics. The characteristics of the included studies are summarized in
Table 1. The earliest study included was reported in 2011 (17); all studies were of a
retrospective cohort design (12–16, 18–22), except for two case-control studies (17, 23).
None of the studies were funded by manufacturing companies; seven were published
(14, 17–19, 21, 23–25), and six were unpublished except as conference abstracts (12, 13,
15, 16, 20, 22). All studies were conducted in the United States (12–16, 18–22), except
for two performed in South Korea (17, 23); all studies were single-center investigations
(12, 13, 15–17, 19, 20, 22, 23), except for three that were multicenter investigations
(14, 18, 21, 24); and all studies were in English. The average age of subjects ranged from

 49 to 65 years. Most studies included patients with MSSA bloodstream infections
(12–19, 21, 22). Six of the studies did not report the doses of antistaphylococcal
penicillins or cefazolin (12, 13, 17, 19, 20, 24). Nafcillin was used in 11 studies (12–17,
19, 20, 24), while oxacillin was used in 5 studies (18, 21–23, 25). Five studies defined
nephrotoxicity as an increase in the serum creatinine level of �0.5 mg/dl or 50% (12,
15, 17, 22–24). The exact definitions of nephrotoxicity in all included studies are
provided in Table 1. The assessments of bias risk are summarized in Table 2.
Study outcomes. All study outcomes are reported as outcomes with cefazolin
versus antistaphylococcal penicillins, with a relative risk (RR) of �1 favoring cefazolin.
When multiple definitions or categories were provided in the published investigations,
we utilized the least conservative definition or category to include the number of
events in the meta-analyses (Table 1). For the primary outcomes of nephrotoxicity and
hepatotoxicity, we used conservative definitions in sensitivity analyses that were based
on an increase in the serum creatinine level or glomerular filtration rate of �50% and
an alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) level �5 � the upper
normal limit, respectively. With the exception of nafcillin discontinuation due to
adverse drug reactions (ADRs), we were not able to perform any subgroup or
sensitivity analyses on the outpatient outcomes since there were fewer than 2
studies per outcome.
Nephrotoxicity and acute interstitial nephritis. Out of 847 hospitalized patients
on cefazolin versus 852 patients on antistaphylococcal penicillins, 126 (14.88%) and 225
(38.66%), respectively, experienced nephrotoxicity (Peto odds ratio [OR], 0.255 [95%
confidence interval {CI}, 0.127 to 0.513; P � 0.001]; I2 � 0%; Q � 4.753 [P � 0.002]) (Fig.
2). Subgroup analysis showed that the reduced nephrotoxicity with cefazolin was

OR, 0.451 [95% CI, 0.2019 to 0.928; P � 0.031]; I2 � 0%; Q � 4.606 [P � 0.141]) showed
consistent findings. None of the patients (n � 83) on cefazolin had acute interstitial
nephritis, compared to 12/136 (8.82%) of patients on antistaphylococcal penicillins
(Peto OR, 0.189 [95% CI, 0.053 to 0.675; P � 0.010]; I2 � 0%; Q � 0.450 [P � 0.799]).
In studies of outpatients, a statistically significant reduced risk of nephrotoxicity was
found with cefazolin compared to antistaphylococcal penicillins (Peto OR, 0.372 [95%
CI, 0.192 to 0.722; P � 0.003]; I2 � 0%; Q � 0.136 [P � 0.712]).
Hepatotoxicity. For the studies of hospitalized patients, 2 out of 258 patients
(0.78%) on cefazolin experienced hepatotoxicity, compared to 20 out of 263 patients
(7.6%) who received antistaphylococcal penicillins (Peto OR, 0.160 [95% CI, 0.066 to
0.387; P � 0.001]; I2 � 0%; Q � 2.508) (Fig. 3). Consistent observations were found in
sensitivity analyses based on published studies (Peto OR, 0.125 [95% CI, 0.031 to 0.495;
P � 0.003]; I2 � 0%; Q � 1.000 [P � 0.201]) and the conservative definition (Peto OR,
0.121 [95% CI, 0.015 to 0.968; P � 0.047]; I2 � 0%; Q � 1.000 [P � 0.199]). The
statistically significant differences persisted with subgroup analysis of cefazolin com-
pared to either nafcillin (Peto OR, 0.252 [95% CI, 0.087 to 0.731; P � 0.011]; I2 � 0%;
Q � 1.878 [P � 0.598]) or oxacillin (Peto OR, 0.049 [95% CI, 0.010 to 0.240; P � 0.001];
I2 � 0%; Q � 0.161 [P � 0.688]).
In the studies of outpatients, a statistically significant reduced risk of hepatotoxicity
was found with cefazolin compared to antistaphylococcal penicillins (Peto OR, 0.313
[95% CI, 0.156 to 0.627; P � 0.001]; I2 � 0%; Q � 0.212 [P � 0.645]).
Discontinuation due to ADRs. Out of 269 hospitalized patients, 4 (1.49%) in the
cefazolin group had therapy interrupted due to ADRs, compared to 31 out of 277
patients (11.19%) in the antistaphylococcal penicillin group (Peto OR, 0.192 [95% CI,
0.089 to 0.414; P � 0.001]; I2 � 0%; Q � 3.840 [P � 0.321]) (Fig. 4). We found consistent
findings in our sensitivity analysis of published studies (Peto OR, 0.122 [95% CI, 0.052
to 0.287; P � 0.001]; I2 � 0%; Q � 0.099 [P � 0.952]) and in our subgroup analysis of
nafcillin (Peto OR, 0.221 [95% CI, 0.088 to 0.555; P � 0.001]; I2 � 0%; Q � 2.810 [P �
0.267]). Oxacillin was used in only one study (18), which had a statistically significant
finding by itself.
For outpatients, statistically significant lower rates of discontinuation due to ADRs
were originally identified in one study (24) but statistical significance did not persist in
the meta-analysis of data from that study and the second study (25) (Peto OR, 0.432
[95% CI, 0.127 to 1.474; P � 0.180]; I2 � 0%; Q � 1.000 [P � 0.040]). However, a
subgroup analysis showed that the difference was statistically significant compared to
nafcillin (Peto OR, 0.267 [95% CI, 0.172 to 0.415; P � 0.001]; I2 � 0%; Q � 0.401 [P �

 Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. In hospitalized patients, no statistically sig-

outpatients toward less neutropenia with cefazolin (Peto OR, 0.512 [95% CI, 0.240 to
1.091; P � 0.083]; I2 � 0%; Q � 0.5 [P � 0.480]).

566.776; P � 0.608]; I2 � 0%; Q � 1.000 [P � 0.037]).
DISCUSSION
The findings from this systematic review suggest that treatment with cefazolin in
adults is associated with a clinically important favorable safety profile compared to
antistaphylococcal penicillins because of lower risks of nephrotoxicity, acute interstitial
nephritis, hepatotoxicity, hypersensitivity reactions, and discontinuation due to ADRs.
In other studies, cefazolin has demonstrated at least equivalent efficacy compared to
antistaphylococcal penicillins (26) and improved cost-effectiveness (14). Therefore,
cefazolin should be considered a first-line treatment option for MSSA bacteremia.
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review with meta-analyses to assess the
safety of antistaphylococcal penicillins. There was one previous meta-analysis (27). It
was reported in 2014, no unpublished work was included, and the authors of that study
stated that there were too few reported adverse events to provide meaningful com-
parisons. We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and included several recent studies. Our primary analyses
included both published and unpublished work using less-conservative definitions, but
the findings did not change when we limited the analyses to either published studies
or more-conservative definitions. This suggests that our findings are robust, but a large
randomized controlled trial to assess both efficacy and safety is needed to reduce the
likelihood of both measured and unmeasured confounders.
Most patients in our included studies had MSSA bloodstream infections. Since
patients with bacteremia are often treated for a prolonged period of time, there is a
greater possibility of patients experiencing side effects. Knowing the safer antibiotic
option is of great clinical relevance. For example, in a retrospective cohort study by Blot
FIG 4 Forest plot showing the Peto odds ratios of drug discontinuation due to adverse reactions for patients receiving cefazolin versus antistaphylococcal
penicillin (ASP) (14, 16–18).

 et al., MSSA bacteremia was associated with a long length of stay and a high treatment
cost in comparison to cases caused by other organisms (28). It is unclear how these
findings could be related to the use of antistaphylococcal penicillins for cases of MSSA
bacteremia. Moreover, a recent large multicenter retrospective cohort study by Mc-
Danel et al. (29) showed a significantly lower mortality risk with cefazolin than with
nafcillin or oxacillin. If this difference in mortality is true, it is possibly due to antibiotic-
related ADRs and the associated antibiotic discontinuation rates in light of findings
from more-recent studies that suggest equivalent efficacies of cefazolin and antistaphy-
lococcal penicillins (26).
The only antistaphylococcal penicillins used in the studies included in our systematic
review were nafcillin and oxacillin. We would expect relatively similar findings with
other agents in this class, such as cloxacillin and flucloxacillin, but further studies are
needed to confirm this hypothesis. Our primary aim was not to compare the safety of
the various antistaphylococcal penicillins. Although our results demonstrate that both
nafcillin and oxacillin have an inferior safety profile compared to cefazolin, subgroup
analyses according to the type of antistaphylococcal penicillin did not identify signif-
icant differences, with the exception of higher nafcillin discontinuation rates due to
ADRs in outpatients. A previous study found that nafcillin was associated with a high
discontinuation rate due to ADRs compared to oxacillin (30). The results of our analysis
are unable to confirm or refute this finding since we did not perform a head-to-head
analysis, and the oxacillin subgroup could be simply underpowered.
We did not combine data from studies of hospitalized patients with those involving
outpatients because of several differences in heterogeneity, including the frequency
and length of monitoring of ADRs as well as the treatment duration. Similarly to
hospitalized patients, outpatients who received antistaphylococcal penicillins were at
higher risks of nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and drug discontinuation due to ADRs.
However, only outpatients who received antistaphylococcal penicillins were at a higher
risk of a hypersensitivity reaction. Some of these ADRs have a delayed onset, which
could explain why these ADRs are more likely to be detected in outpatients with
more-prolonged follow-up. Despite no statistically significant differences in neutrope-
nia in hospitalized patients, outpatients had a nonsignificant trend toward a higher risk
of neutropenia with the use of antistaphylococcal penicillins. In the study using
nafcillin, statistical significance was achieved. It is unclear if this is due to differences in
the patient population, the type of antistaphylococcal penicillins, or the frequency of
monitoring. However, it is worth mentioning that most of the studies (14, 16, 22) that
assessed hospitalized patients used these �-lactams for short durations (�2 weeks).
It is still unclear if individuals with deep-seated infections with a high MSSA burden,
such as those with endocarditis, should be treated with cefazolin or antistaphylococcal
penicillins. There is consensus that individuals with central nervous system infections
should not be treated with cefazolin because of its poor penetration of the blood-brain
barrier. For other MSSA infections, the decision by clinicians to use cefazolin or
antistaphylococcal penicillins should take into account toxicity as well as efficacy and
cost considerations. Another limitation of our analysis was the inability to compare
study outcomes based on dose. For those studies that reported cefazolin dosing,
standardization of dosing according to renal function was not always well described.
Given the safety and concerns about the inoculum effect of cefazolin, it seems prudent
to use a higher dose of 2 g q8h in most patients with normal renal function. Given the
fact that some study participants may have continued antibiotic therapy after discharge
and may have chosen to seek care at a local hospital or clinic instead of the original
hospital at which the studies were conducted, uncertainty as to the extent of follow-up
after hospital discharge is possible. Since the included studies were observational and
antistaphylococcal penicillins are believed by some clinicians to cause more ADRs,
clinicians are perhaps more likely to monitor ADRs and attribute some ADRs to these
agent rather than cefazolin. Therefore, anchoring bias has to be considered.
In conclusion, this systematic review found that the use of cefazolin in both
inpatients and outpatients is associated with low risks of nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity,

 and discontinuation due ADRs compared to antistaphylococcal penicillins regardless of
publication status, definition, and type of penicillins. In outpatients, hypersensitivity
reactions also occurred less frequently with cefazolin. No significant differences in other
adverse events were found, but there was a nonsignificant trend toward lower rates of
neutropenia in outpatients. Future large randomized clinical trials should be conducted
on the safety of beta-lactam antibiotics. However, our results provide additional
evidence that cefazolin should be considered a first-line option for patients with MSSA
infections when its efficacy is presumed to be similar to that of antistaphylococcal
penicillins.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The meta-analyses were conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines (31) (see Table S1 in the
supplemental material). This study is registered with PROSPERO International Prospective Register of
Systematic Reviews (registration number CRD42017069474).
Search strategy and study selection. The full search strategy is provided in the supplemental
material. Two authors of this study (K.E. and S.A.) independently searched the PubMed, Embase, and
International Pharmaceutical Abstracts biomedical databases as well as the ClinicalTrials.gov and Clini-
calTrialsRegister.eu websites without date or language restrictions through 23 June 2017. In addition, the
following infectious disease and pharmacy conference proceedings were searched between 2010 and 23
June 2017: the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology
and Infectious Diseases, the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy/ASM
Microbe, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, and the American College of Clinical
Pharmacy. The references of the included studies were checked to identify additional studies. Two
authors of this study (K.E and S.A.) independently extracted the data regarding study characteristics
(Table 1) and any safety endpoints. Any disagreement between the authors was resolved through
discussion. Any study that compared the safety of antistaphylococcal penicillins to that of cefazolin in
adults was included. One analysis focused on studies of hospitalized patients, whereas the other included
outpatients only. Typically, inpatients would be sicker and more likely to have confounding factors,
including other medications. In addition, outpatients are monitored less frequently than inpatients. For
example, it might be easier to detect nephrotoxicity in inpatients, but this could be missed in outpa-
tients, even if changes in renal function met the definition of nephrotoxicity. Moreover, outpatients are
monitored for longer periods, and some adverse events might have been detected later when individuals
were outpatients but did not occur while they were inside the hospital. On the other hand, studies of
outpatients would not report adverse events that had occurred before discharge from the hospital.
Data analysis. The primary outcomes were rates of defined nephrotoxicity, defined hepatotoxicity,
and discontinuation due to ADRs. Studies that did not provide the definitions for nephrotoxicity and
hepatotoxicity were excluded. For primary outcomes, we performed a subgroup analysis according to
the type of antistaphylococcal penicillin as well as sensitivity analyses based on both publication status
and the more-conservative definitions among the included studies. Secondary outcomes included rates
of any other ADRs reported in at least two studies. Heterogeneity (I2) was assessed by using Cochran’
s
chi-squared test. The Peto ORs with 95% CIs were estimated by using random-effects models. The
authors of the studies were contacted for missing data. The quality of studies was independently
evaluated by using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) for observational studies (32). Publication bias was
visually assessed by using the funnel plot, and asymmetry was tested by using the Egger test (see Fig.
S4 to S6 in the supplemental material). All analyses were conducted by using Comprehensive Meta-
Analysis Version 3 software (Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA).
