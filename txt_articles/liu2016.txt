Background:
 In  Canada,
 private
 purchase
 of  human  papilloma
 virus  (HPV)
 vaccines
 has  been  possible
 since
2006.
 In Alberta,
 Canada,
 a publicly
 funded  quadrivalent
 HPV  vaccine
 program
 began
 in the
 2008/2009
school
 year.  There  have
 been
 concerns
 about  adverse
 events,  including
 venous  thromboembolism
 (VTE)
associated
 with  HPV
 vaccines.
 We  describe
 the  frequencies
 of
 adverse
 events
 following
 HPV  vaccination
among
 Alberta  females  aged  9  years  or  older
 and  look  at  VTE  following
 HPV  vaccination.
Methods:
 We  used  the  Alberta
 Immunization
 and  Adverse  Reaction
 to Immunization
 (Imm/ARI)
 repository
(publicly
 funded  vaccine),
 the population-based
 Pharmaceutical
 Information
 Network
 (PIN)  information
system
 (dispensing
 of  a vaccine),
 and  the  Alberta  Morbidity
 and  Ambulatory
 Care
 Abstract
 reporting
system
 (MACAR)
 for  June  1,  2006–November
 19,  2014.  Deterministic
 data  linkage
 used  unique  personal
identifiers.
 We  identified
 all  reported
 adverse
 events
 following
 immunization
 (AEFI)  and all  emergency
department
 (ED)  utilization
 or  hospitalizations
 within  42 days
 of  immunization.
 We  calculated
 the  fre-
quency
 of  AEFI  by  type,  rates  per  100,000
 doses
 of  HPV  vaccine
 administered
 and  the  frequencies
 of
ICD-10-CA
 codes  for  hospitalizations
 and  emergency
 department
 visits.
Results:
 Over  the  period
 195,270  females
 received
 528,913
 doses
 of  HPV  vaccine.  Of  those
 receiving
 at  least
one
 dose,
 192  reported
 one  or  more
 AEFI
 events
 (198  AEFI  events),
 i.e.,  37.4/100,000
 doses
 administered
(95%
 CI 32.5–43.0).
 None  were  consistent
 with  VTE.  Of  the  women
 who  received  HPV  vaccine  958  were
hospitalized
 and  19,351
 had  an  ED  visit  within  42  days  of  immunization.
 Four  women
 who
 had  an
 ED
visit
 and  hospitalization
 event
 were
 diagnosed
 with  VTE.  Three  of  these
 had
 other  diagnoses
 known
 to
be
 associated
 with  VTE;  the  fourth  woman
 had  VTE
 among
 ED  diagnoses
 but
 not  among
 those
 for  the
hospitalization.
Conclusions:
 Rates  of  AEFI  after
 HPV  immunization
 in  Alberta
 are  low  and  consistent
 with
 types
 of
 events
seen
 elsewhere.

 Introduction
Q2
The
 World
 Health
 Organization
 (WHO)
 recommends
 the
 human
papillomavirus
 (HPV)
 vaccine
 for
 prevention
 of
 cervical
 cancer
and
 other
 HPV-related
 diseases
 [1].
 Quadrivalent
 HPV
 (qHPV)
 vac-
cine
 was
 authorized
 and
 became
 available
 for
 private
 purchase
 in
Canada
 in
 2006
 for
 females
 aged
 9–26
 years.
 This
 authorization
was
 expanded
 to
 include
 females
 aged
 9–45
 years
 in
 2011.
 Bivalent
HPV
 (bHPV)
 vaccine
 was
 also
 authorized
 for
 use
 among
 females
aged
 10–25
 years
 in
 2010.
 Canada’s
 National
 Advisory
 Commit-
tee
 on
 Immunization
 (NACI)
 has
 recommended
 both
 vaccines
 in
females
 aged
 9–26
 years
 of
 age
 [2].
 Both
 vaccines
 were
 initially
administered
 in
 a
 three-dose
 series;
 however
 NACI
 now
 recom-
mends
 a
 two-dose
 series
 for
 immunocompetent
 persons
 aged
9–14
 years
 [2].

In
 Alberta,
 the
 publicly
 funded
 routine
 childhood
 and
 adoles-
cent
 vaccines
 are
 administered
 exclusively
 by
 public
 health
 nurses.
Alberta
 began
 to
 deliver
 a
 publicly
 funded
 three-dose
 qHPV
 vaccine
series
 in
 the
 2008/09
 school
 year
 for
 females
 in
 grade
 5,
 most
 of
whom
 were
 aged
 10–11
 years
 [3].
 A
 catch-up
 program
 was
 imple-
mented
 from
 2009/10
 to
 2011/12
 for
 females
 in
 grade
 9
 (most
 of
whom
 were
 aged
 14–15
 years).
 Both
 qHPV
 and
 bHPV
 vaccines
 are
also
 available
 for
 private
 purchase
 through
 pharmacies.
The
 monitoring
 of
 adverse
 events
 following
 immunization
(AEFI)
 contributes
 to
 vaccine
 safety
 surveillance
 and
 is
 an
 important
component
 of
 all
 vaccination
 programs.
 Vaccine
 safety
 is
 monitored
by
 passive
 surveillance
 in
 Alberta.
 There
 have
 been
 community
 con-
cerns
 that
 HPV
 vaccines
 may
 be
 associated
 with
 adverse
 events.
Venous
 thromboembolic
 events
 (VTE)
 are
 a
 particular
 concern,
 as
some
 were
 reported
 to
 occur
 following
 HPV
 immunization
 in
 the
United
 States
 [4].
 The
 objective
 of
 this
 study
 is
 to
 describe
 the
 fre-
quencies
 of
 adverse
 events
 among
 females
 aged
 9
 years
 or
 older
 that
occurred
 following
 HPV
 vaccination
 including
 looking
 specifically
at
 VTE
 following
 HPV
 vaccination.

 Methods
2.1.
 Ethics
 and
 role
 of
 funding
 source
The
 study
 was
 approved
 by
 the
 University
 of
 Calgary
 Conjoint
Health
 Research
 Ethics
 Board
 (Ethics
 ID:
 REB
 14-0598).
 The
 funding
source
 had
 no
 role
 in
 study
 design,
 collection,
 analysis
 or
 interpre-
tation
 of
 data,
 report
 writing
 or
 publication
 decision.
2.2.
 Data
 source
 and
 data
 extraction
Alberta
 has
 a
 publicly
 funded
 universal
 healthcare
 system
 in
which
 >99%
 of
 residents
 are
 registered
 [5].
 The
 registration
 file
 for
this
 program
 includes
 a
 Person
 Health
 Number
 that
 serves
 as
 a
unique
 personal
 identifier
 (ULI)
 [6]
 that
 permits
 data
 linkage
 at
 the
level
 of
 the
 individual
 across
 other
 administrative
 databases.
 We
used
 ULI
 to
 deterministically
 link
 data
 on
 vaccination,
 AEFI,
 and
healthcare
 utilization.
Alberta’s
 Immunization
 and
 Adverse
 Reaction
 to
 Immuniza-
tion
 repository
 (Imm/ARI)
 contains
 complete
 vaccination
 records,
including
 AEFI,
 for
 all
 publicly
 funded
 vaccines
 that
 were
 admin-
istered
 by
 public
 health
 since
 2006.
 Vaccination
 records
 prior
 to
2006
 comprise
 historical
 data
 and
 are
 entered
 electronically
 into
Imm/ARI
 by
 public
 health
 nurses
 after
 review
 of
 paper
 vaccination
records.
 The
 Pharmaceutical
 Information
 Network
 (PIN)
 contains
records
 of
 all
 prescriptions
 dispensed
 by
 pharmacies,
 whether
 pri-
vately
 or
 publicly
 funded.
 In
 the
 case
 of
 HPV
 vaccine,
 this
 would
only
 include
 privately
 funded
 vaccines.
 It
 is
 estimated
 that
 PIN
captures
 over
 95%
 of
 dispensed
 pharmacologic
 products
 [7].
 We
have
 assumed
 that
 all
 vaccine
 dispensed
 according
 to
 PIN
 was
 actu-
ally
 administered
 to
 the
 purchaser
 as
 the
 cost
 to
 purchaser
 of
 HPV
vaccine
 is
 about
 $150/dose
 [8].
 Both
 Imm/ARI
 and
 PIN
 contain
 infor-
mation
 on
 the
 patient,
 vaccine,
 dose,
 and
 date
 that
 vaccine
 was
administered/dispensed
 [9].
In
 Alberta,
 AEFI
 surveillance
 is
 a
 passive
 reporting
 system.
 Indi-
viduals
 who
 experience
 an
 AEFI
 report
 to
 their
 vaccine
 provider,
who
 completes
 a
 provincial
 AEFI
 reporting
 form;
 the
 data
 are
entered
 into
 Imm/ARI
 [10];
 Alberta
 Health
 then
 reports
 AEFI
 to
the
 Public
 Health
 Agency
 of
 Canada.
 The
 provincial
 AEFI
 reporting
form
 consists
 of
 a
 close
 ended
 checklist
 of
 types
 of
 adverse
 events,
accompanied
 by
 an
 open
 ended
 text
 field
 into
 which
 a
 descrip-
tion
 of
 event
 is
 to
 be
 entered
 as
 well
 as
 an
 open
 ended
 comment
section.
 The
 reporting
 form
 also
 collects
 time
 of
 onset
 following
immunization,
 outcome,
 hospitalization
 dates,
 patient
 identifiers,
vaccine
 antigens,
 vaccination
 date,
 and
 dose
 number.
 Alberta
policy
 is
 that
 providers
 should
 “Report
 events
 that
 do
 not
 meet
specific
 case
 definitions
 but
 are
 felt
 to
 be
 significant
 (i.e.,
 serious
or
 unusual)
 under
 [checkbox]
 Other
 Severe
 or
 Unusual
 Events.  .
 .
When
 an
 AEFI
 is:
• Serious
 (death,
 hospitalization,
 congenital
 abnormality,
 residual
abnormality,
 life
 threatening),
 unexpected
 (in
 terms
 of
 type
 or
frequency),
• Of
 concern
 (to
 the
 vaccine,
 his/her
 caregiver(s)
 or
 AEFI
 reporter).”
AEFI’s
 that
 meet
 any
 of
 these
 criteria
 should
 be
 reported
 regard-
less
 of
 consistency
 with
 time
 period
 of
 occurrence
 for
 the
 event
 of
the
 case
 definition
 of
 any
 such
 event.
 VTE
 cases
 are
 captured
 by
 the
checkbox
 ‘other
 unusual
 events’
 on
 the
 AEFI
 reporting
 form.
 Event
codes
 and
 text
 descriptions
 on
 all
 AEFI
 reports
 are
 reviewed
 by
trained
 nurses
 and
 coded
 into
 Imm/ARI.
 Information
 related
 to
 hos-
pitalizations
 and
 emergency
 department
 (ED)
 visits
 are
 captured
in
 the
 Alberta
 Morbidity
 and
 Ambulatory
 Care
 Abstract
 Reporting
(MACAR)
 system,
 including
 dates
 of
 admission
 and
 discharge,
 and
ICD-10-CA
 (International
 Classification
 of
 Diseases,
 10th
 Revision-
Canadian
 Adaptation)
 codes
 for
 diagnoses.
We
 extracted
 data
 on
 vaccinations,
 AEFI
 reports,
 hospitaliza-
tions
 and
 ED
 visits
 (within
 42
 days
 of
 vaccination)
 [4,11]
 for
 all
females
 for
 whom
 an
 HPV
 dispense
 or
 vaccination
 event
 was
recorded
 over
 June
 1,
 2006–November
 19,
 2014,
 using
 ULI
 to
 link
records
 for
 unique
 individuals.
2.3.
 Data
 analysis
We  counted
 the
 number
 of
 females
 who
 received
 one
 or
 more
doses
 of
 HPV
 vaccine
 by
 number
 of
 doses
 received
 and
 age
 at
first
 dose.
 We  described
 the
 frequencies
 of
 occurrence
 of
 AEFIs
by
 type
 of
 AEFI,
 and
 dose
 number
 associated
 with
 the
 AEFI.
 We
calculated
 rates
 of
 AEFI
 per
 100,000
 doses
 of
 HPV
 vaccine
 dis-
pensed/administered
 by
 dividing
 counts
 of
 AEFIs
 by
 the
 number
 of
vaccine
 doses
 received
 among
 the
 population
 of
 interest
 over
 the
period.
 We  described
 hospitalizations
 within
 42
 days
 of
 HPV
 vacci-
nations
 by
 ICD-10-CA
 diagnostic
 codes
 for
 the
 most
 responsible
diagnoses
 for
 all
 hospitalizations
 within
 42
 days
 of
 immuniza-
tion.
 “Most
 responsible
 diagnosis”
 is
 recorded
 by
 the
 health
 care
provider
 at
 discharge,
 using
 general
 coding
 standards
 that
 define
the
 most
 responsible
 diagnostic
 ICD
 code
 as
 that
 responsible
 for
 the
greatest
 portion
 of
 the
 length
 of
 stay
 or
 greatest
 use
 of
 resources
[12].
 A
 hospitalization
 event
 is
 defined
 as
 a
 hospital
 visit
 where
 a
person
 was
 admitted
 and
 discharged
 from
 a
 hospital.
 Some
 hos-
pitalization
 events
 were
 recorded
 twice
 because
 the
 person
 had
one
 hospital
 visit
 that
 was
 temporally
 associated
 with
 receipt
 of
two
 different
 vaccine
 doses
 (e.g.,
 was
 hospitalized
 within
 42
 days
of
 receiving
 both
 dose
 1
 and
 dose
 2).
 For
 these,
 we
 removed
 the
duplicate
 event
 and
 counted
 it
 as
 a
 single
 hospitalization
 event.
For
 each
 person,
 we  assumed
 that
 a
 transfer
 from
 one
 hospi-
tal
 to
 another
 had
 occurred
 if
 the
 date
 of
 discharge
 from
 the
first
 hospital
 was
 the
 same
 as
 the
 date
 of
 admission
 to
 a
 sec-
ond
 hospital.
 We  counted
 each
 hospital
 transfer
 as
 a
 separate
event.
 However,
 for
 the
 purpose
 of
 describing
 the
 frequency
 of
the
 most
 responsible
 diagnoses
 (the
 diagnosis
 that
 contributed
the
 greatest
 to
 length
 of
 stay)
 for
 such
 persons,
 we  counted
 each
most
 responsible
 diagnosis
 if
 they
 differed
 between
 hospitaliza-
tion
 events.
 We  operationally
 defined
 ‘serious’
 AEFI
 as
 those
 that
resulted
 in
 hospitalization
 and
 counted
 the
 number
 of
 ‘serious’
AEFI.
 We  linked
 hospitalizations
 and
 ED
 visits
 to
 identify
 those
who
 reported
 both
 events
 within
 42
 days
 of
 vaccination.
 Data
 anal-
yses
 were
 conducted
 using

 9.3

 AEFI
 review
 to
 identify
 VTE
One
 investigator
 (MLR),
 a
 physician,
 reviewed
 all
 text
 descrip-
tions
 for
 AEFIs
 coded
 as
 ‘other
 unusual
 events’
 for
 evidence
 that
 the
AEFI
 might
 have
 been
 VTE.
2.5.
 Identification
 of
 VTE
 not
 captured
 by
 AEFI
 reports
In
 order
 to
 maximize
 the
 chances
 of
 finding
 a
 VTE
 that
 was
 not
captured
 by
 an
 AEFI
 report
 within
 Imm/ARI,
 we  identified
 within
MACAR
 all
 females
 who
 were
 hospitalized
 or
 visited
 the
 ED
 within
42
 days
 of
 vaccination
 by
 deterministically
 linking
 Imm/ARI,
 PIN
and
 MACAR
 using
 the
 ULI.
 Our
 definition
 of
 VTE
 for
 this
 study
 was
the
 occurrence
 of
 an
 ICD-10-CA
 diagnostic
 code
 of
 I80.x
 or
 I82.x
 in
any
 of
 the
 potential
 diagnostic
 code
 fields
 (25)
 for
 a
 hospitalization
or
 ED
 (10)
 visit.
 For
 any
 woman
 who
 had
 such
 an
 ICD-10-CA
 code
for
 a
 hospitalization
 or

As
 can
 be
 seen
 from
 Table
 1,
 from
 June
 1,
 2006
 to
 November
 19,
2014,
 195,270
 females
 received
 one
 or
 more
 doses
 of
 HPV
 vaccine.
They
 received
 a
 total
 of
 528,913
 publicly
 and
 privately
 funded
 doses
of
 vaccine
 over
 the
 study
 period.
 Nearly
 all
 of
 the
 vaccine
 was
 qHPV
(99.2%
 of
 doses).
 The
 majority
 of
 women
 received
 three
 doses
 of
HPV
 vaccine
 (82.4%),
 while
 a
 smaller
 proportion
 received
 only
 two
doses
 (9.9%)
 or
 only
 one
 dose
 (6.4%).
 Most
 were
 aged
 9–14
 years
(79.5%)
 when
 their
 first
 dose
 of
 HPV
 vaccine
 was
 received,
 followed
by
 age
 groups
 15–19

 (10.0%),
 20–24

 Frequency
 of
 occurrence
 of
 AEFI
 &
 serious
 AEFI
 events
Of
 the
 195,270
 women
 who
 received
 HPV
 vaccine,
 192
 (<0.1%)
reported
 one
 or
 more
 AEFI
 events
 (198
 AEFI
 events).
 Of
 the
 192,
186
 reported
 one
 AEFI
 event,
 while
 six
 reported
 two
 different
 AEFI
events.
 All
 AEFI
 events
 occurred
 after
 receipt
 of
 the
 qHPV
 vaccine.
Six
 persons
 who
 experienced
 an
 AEFI
 had
 received
 one
 or
 more
vaccines
 in
 addition
 to
 HPV
 on
 the
 same
 day
 as
 they
 received
 HPV
vaccine.
 Table
 2
 displays
 the
 frequency
 of
 occurrence
 of
 types
 of
AEFI
 by
 dose
 of
 HPV
 vaccine
 in
 series
 received
 that
 corresponded
 to
the
 AEFI
 event.
 Among
 the
 198
 events,
 the
 most
 commonly
 reported
events
 were
 allergic
 reaction
 (n
 =
 90),
 other
 unusual
 events
 (n
 =
 34),
other
 rash
 (n
 =
 32),
 and
 pain
 and/or
 swelling
 (n
 =
 23)
 (Table
 2).
Most
 AEFI
 events
 occurred
 after
 receipt
 of
 the
 first
 dose
 of
 vac-
cine
 (n
 =
 117),
 followed
 by
 second
 (n
 =
 55)
 and
 third
 (n
 =
 25)
 doses.
Review
 of
 the
 text
 fields
 for
 ‘other
 unusual
 events’
 found
 none
 of
these
 events
 to
 be
 consistent
 with
 VTE.
Of
 the
 192
 persons
 reporting
 AEFI
 events,
 five
 had
 a
 serious
 AEFI,
(all
 classified
 as
 ‘serious’
 because
 of
 hospitalization);
 however
 only
4
 of
 them
 were
 hospitalized
 within
 42
 days
 of
 immunization.
 The
fifth
 person
 was
 hospitalized
 on
 day
 110,
 well
 outside
 of
 the
 42
 day
window.
3.3.
 Rate
 of
 occurrence
 &
 outcome
 of
 AEFI
 events
Over
 the
 study
 period,
 the
 rate
 of
 AEFI
 events
 was
 37.4
 per
100,000
 doses
 of
 HPV
 vaccine
 administered
 (95%
 CI:
 32.5–43.0).
 The
rate
 varied
 over
 time:
 no
 events
 were
 reported
 for
 2006
 or
 2007,
however
 only
 about
 5000
 doses
 of
 vaccine
 were
 dispensed
 in
 those
years
 (data
 not
 shown).
 For
 the
 period
 January
 1,
 2008–November
19,
 2014,
 the
 rate
 was
 37.7
 per
 100,000
 doses
 (95%
 CI:
 32.8–43.3).
AEFI
 rates
 varied
 over
 time,
 peaking
 in
 2011
 (Fig.
 1).
Of
 the
 198
 AEFI
 events,
 the
 outcomes
 were
 known
 for
 171,
 all
 of
which
 were
 full
 recovery.
3.4.
 Hospitalization
 within
 42
 days
 of
 vaccination
Among
 the
 195,270
 females
 who
 received
 HPV
 vaccine,
 958
were
 hospitalized
 (1053
 hospitalization
 events)
 within
 42
 days
 of
immunization;
 however
 only
 4
 of
 those
 hospitalized
 had
 a
 reported
AEFI
 (see
 above).
 Of
 the
 958
 who
 were
 hospitalized,
 most
 (861,
89.8%)
 had
 only
 one
 hospitalization
 event
 within
 42
 days
 of
 immu-
nization.
 The
 large
 majority
 of
 those
 hospitalized
 were
 aged
 9–14
years
 (66.0%)
 or
 15–19
 years
 (22.0%).
 The
 proportion
 of
 hospitaliza-
tions
 that
 occurred
 on
 the
 same
 day
 as
 vaccination
 was
 0.7%,
 34.6%
within
 1–14
 days,
 32.8%
 within
 15–28
 days,
 and
 31.9%
 within
 29–42
days
 (data
 not
 shown).

a Six
 of
 the
 192
 persons
 who
 experienced
 an
 AEFI
 had
 an
 AEFI
 on
 two
 occasions.
Thirty-two
 women
 had
 hospital
 transfers.
 Thirty-one
 women
had
 one
 hospital
 transfer
 and
 one
 woman
 had
 two
 transfers,
 result-
ing
 in
 69
 hospitalization
 events.
 Of
 these,
 six
 transfers
 (12
 events)
had
 the
 same
 most
 responsible
 diagnosis.
 Fourteen
 women
 had
multiple
 hospitalization
 records
 because
 they
 received
 two
 doses
 of
HPV
 vaccine
 within
 42
 days,
 and
 thus
 both
 doses
 were
 temporally
associated
 with
 the
 hospitalization.
 Fifty-two
 persons
 had
 more
than
 one
 hospitalization
 event
 because
 they
 were
 hospitalized
 on
separate
 occasions
 (i.e.,
 these
 were
 not
 hospital
 transfers).
 From
the
 1053
 hospitalization
 events,
 after
 accounting
 for
 transfers,
 we
counted
 1047
 most
 responsible
 diagnoses.
The
 frequencies
 of
 the
 1047
 most
 responsible
 diagnoses
 are
shown
 in
 Table
 3.
 Mental,
 behavioral
 and
 neurodevelopmental
 dis-
orders
 (19.4%)
 were
 the
 most
 frequently
 coded
 most
 responsible
diagnoses,
 followed
 by
 diseases
 of
 the
 digestive
 system
 (15.8%),
and
 injury,
 poisoning
 and
 certain
 other
 consequences
 of
 external
causes
 (13.8%).
3.5.
 Identification
 of
 VTE
 among
 those
 hospitalized
In
 addition
 to
 assessing
 frequencies
 of
 the
 most
 responsible
diagnoses
 we
 examined
 all
 ICD-10-CA
 diagnostic
 codes
 (in
 any
 of
the
 fields
 possible
 for
 hospitalizations)
 for
 codes
 corresponding
 to
our
 case
 definition
 of
 VTE.
 There
 were
 three
 women
 who
 had
 such
codes.
 The
 first
 had
 a
 most
 responsible
 diagnosis
 of
 Z50.1
 (other
physical
 therapy),
 and
 an
 I80.2
 other
 diagnosis.
 She
 was
 26
 years
of
 age
 and
 received
 the
 first
 dose
 of
 HPV
 vaccine
 23
 days
 prior
 to
hospitalization.
 The
 other
 ICD-10-CA
 codes
 were
 consistent
 with
having
 incurred
 an
 injury.
The
 second,
 aged
 11
 years,
 had
 a
 most
 responsible
 diagnosis
 of
R07.4
 (chest
 pain
 unspecified),
 and
 an
 I80.1
 other
 diagnosis.
 She
 had
received
 the
 third
 dose
 of
 HPV
 vaccine
 14
 days
 prior
 to
 hospitaliza-
tion.
 The
 other
 ICD-10-CA
 codes
 for
 this
 hospitalization
 indicated
the
 presence
 of
 a
 congenital
 heart
 defect
 known
 to
 be
 associated
with
 VTE.
The
 third
 was
 hospitalized
 for
 most
 responsible
 diagnosis
 of
I80.2
 (phlebitis
 and
 thrombophlebitis
 of
 other
 deep
 vessels
 of
 lower
extremities).
 She
 was
 14
 years
 of
 age
 and
 received
 the
 third
 dose
 of
HPV
 vaccine
 11
 days
 prior
 to
 hospitalization.
 Review
 of
 the
 other
ICD
 10
 codes
 for
 this
 hospitalization
 indicated
 that
 the
 VTE
 was
classified
 as
 a
 complication
 of
 other
 diagnoses
 (sepsis)
 that
 caused
the
 hospitalization.
Two
 of
 these
 three
 persons
 had
 received
 one
 or
 more
 vac-
cines
 in
 addition
 to
 HPV
 on
 the
 same
 days
 as
 they
 received
HPV
 vaccine.
 None
 of
 those
 hospitalized
 with
 a
 VTE
 diagnosis
died.

 19,351
 had
 an

 visit
within
 42
 days
 of
 immunization
 (26,849

 Discussion
In
 this
 study,
 we
 linked
 vaccination
 data
 with
 AEFI
 reports,
 hos-
pitalization
 records,
 and
 ED
 visit
 records,
 at
 a
 population-level,
 to
describe
 AEFI
 type
 as
 well
 as
 to
 identify
 VTEs
 that
 may
 be
 related
to
 HPV
 vaccination
 among
 women
 aged
 9
 years
 or
 older.
 We  found
an
 AEFI
 rate
 (37.4/100,000
 doses)
 that
 was
 substantially
 less
 than
that
 from
 reports
 from
 the
 American
 Vaccine
 Adverse
 Event
 Repor-
ting
 System
 (VAERS)
 (53.9/100,000
 doses)
 [14].
 The
 most
 common
types
 of
 adverse
 events
 that
 we
 observed
 (e.g.,
 allergic
 reactions,
‘other
 unusual
 events’,
 rash)
 were
 similar
 to
 those
 found
 from
analysis
 of
 the
 VAERS
 data
 [14]
 and
 similar
 to
 those
 seen
 in
 the
province
 of
 Ontario
 [15].
 Our
 results
 are
 consistent
 with
 other
 large
post-licensure
 safety
 and
 surveillance
 studies
 that
 found
 that
 HPV
vaccines
 are
 safe
 [11,16].
While
 we
 observed
 three
 cases
 of
 VTE
 among
 those
 hospitalized
within
 42
 days
 of
 immunization,
 all
 three
 had
 other
 health
 condi-
tions
 known
 to
 be
 associated
 with
 VTE.
 While
 one
 additional
 person
had
 an
 ED
 visit
 with
 a
 VTE
 code,
 this
 code
 was
 not
 among
 the
 dis-
charge
 diagnoses
 for
 the
 immediately
 following
 hospitalization.
 We
think
 it
 likely
 that
 the
 VTE
 diagnosis
 from
 the
 ED
 visit
 was
 a
 tenta-
tive
 diagnosis
 that
 was
 not
 substantiated
 by
 further
 investigations
during
 hospitalization.
 While
 Gee
 and
 colleagues
 [4]
 noted
 an
 asso-
ciation
 with
 VTE
 after
 HPV
 immunization,
 this
 association
 was
 not
statistically
 significant,
 only
 five
 confirmed
 cases
 were
 observed
and
 all
 of
 those
 cases
 had
 other
 known
 risk
 factors
 for
 VTE.
 Other
investigators
 have
 found
 no
 association
 between
 HPV
 vaccination
and
 the
 occurrence
 of
 VTE
 [11,16–18].
In
 Alberta,
 AEFI
 events
 are
 reportable
 if
 they
 meet
 case
 defini-
tions
 outlined
 by
 Alberta
 Health
 [10].
 AEFI
 reports
 are
 reviewed
by
 public
 health
 nurses
 who
 ensure
 AEFIs
 meet
 case
 definitions
and
 enter
 the
 data
 into
 Imm/ARI.
 We  found
 a
 higher
 rate
 of
 AEFI
events
 (37.4/100,000)
 than
 that
 reported
 for
 the
 Ontario
 schoolgirl
HPV
 immunization
 program
 over
 2007–2011
 (19.2/100,000
 doses
dispensed)
 [15].
 These
 differences
 are
 almost
 certainly
 due
 to
 the
use
 of
 stricter
 guidelines
 for
 the
 classification
 of
 AEFI
 in
 Ontario.
Harris
 and
 colleagues
 identified
 213
 qHPV
 AEFI
 reports
 for
 Ontario,
of
 whom
 only
 the
 133
 classified
 as
 ‘confirmed’
 were
 used
 in
 their
analyses.
 If
 all
 213
 reports
 had
 been
 used,
 the
 Ontario
 rate
 of
 AEFI
would
 have
 been
 30.7/100,000;
 a
 rate
 much
 closer
 to
 that
 which
we
 observed.
 However,
 as
 was
 also
 seen
 in
 Ontario,
 AEFI
 rates
 var-
ied
 by
 year.
 Passive
 surveillance
 data
 may
 be
 affected
 by
 numerous
factors,
 including
 “biased
 reporting,
 underreporting
 and
 the
 inabil-
ity
 to
 determine
 whether
 a
 vaccine
 caused
 the
 adverse
 event
 in
any
 individual
 report”
 [19].
 Changes
 in
 reporting
 may
 result
 from
changes
 in
 the
 reporting
 practices
 of
 healthcare
 personnel,
 or
 by
community
 concerns
 (resulting
 in
 increased
 reporting
 to
 health-
care
 personnel)
 [20,21].
 It
 is
 possible
 that
 the
 2011
 publication
 of
the
 report
 of
 Gee
 and
 colleagues
 [4]
 might
 have
 affected
 reporting
rates
 elsewhere,
 including
 in
 Ontario
 and
 in
 Alberta.
 However
 it
 is
also
 possible
 that
 a
 longer
 follow-up
 time
 for
 HPV
 immunizations
administered
 in
 the
 earlier
 years
 of
 the
 study
 period
 may
 also
 have
contributed
 to
 the
 observed
 pattern
 of
 reporting.
The
 strengths
 of
 this
 study
 included
 capturing
 women
 who
 had
received
 either
 publicly
 funded
 or
 privately
 purchased
 HPV
 vac-
cines.
 Similarly,
 in
 addition
 to
 the
 passively
 reported
 AEFI
 data,
our
 design
 overcame
 the
 limitations
 of
 passive
 reporting
 in
 our
search
 for
 VTE
 by
 accessing
 the
 records
 of
 all
 hospitalizations
 for
the
 entire
 population
 of
 women
 immunized
 regardless
 of
 types
of
 vaccine
 received
 or
 modes
 of
 vaccine
 funding.
 However,
 our
study
 also
 has
 limitations.
 Residents
 of
 Alberta
 who
 were
 hospi-
talized
 within
 Alberta
 but
 immunized
 out
 of
 province
 would
 not
have
 been
 captured.
 Similarly,
 those
 who
 were
 immunized
 within
Alberta
 but
 hospitalized
 out
 of
 province
 would
 not
 have
 been
 cap-
tured.
 We  do
 not
 know
 how
 many
 women
 this
 would
 be,
 but
 posit
that
 the
 numbers
 are
 small.
 We  did
 not
 validate
 the
 ICD
 codes
 for
hospitalizations
 or
 emergency
 department
 visits
 by
 chart
 review.
As
 the
 predictive
 value
 of
 ICD
 codes
 for
 VTE
 is
 variable
 [17]
 this
may
 have
 led
 to
 misclassification
 of
 outcome.
 Even
 in
 the
 absence
of
 misclassification,
 it
 is
 possible
 that
 VTE
 identified
 during
 hospi-
talization
 might
 have
 had
 symptom
 onset
 prior
 to
 hospitalization.
Finally,
 the
 women
 in
 our
 study
 received
 528,913
 doses
 of
 vaccine:
thus
 AEFI
 that
 occur
 very
 rarely
 but
 which
 are
 truly
 associated
 with
immunization
 with
 HPV
 vaccine
 would
 not
 be
 detected.
5.
 Conclusion
Adverse
 events
 following
 HPV
 immunization
 in
 Alberta
 are
 low,
consistent
 with
 those
 seen
 elsewhere,
 and
 consistent
 in
 the
 types
of
 event
 seen
 elsewhere.
