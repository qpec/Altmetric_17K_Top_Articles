Abstract
The major components of human diet both past and present may be estimated by measur-
ing the carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios (δ13C and δ15N) of the collagenous proteins in
bone and tooth dentine. However, the results from these two tissues differ substantially:
bone collagen records a multi-year average whilst primary dentine records and retains time-
bound isotope ratios deriving from the period of tooth development. Recent studies har-
nessing a sub-annual temporal sampling resolution have shed new light on the individual
dietary histories of our ancestors by identifying unexpected radical short-term dietary
changes, the duration of breastfeeding and migration where dietary change occurs, and by
raising questions regarding factors other than diet that may impact on δ13C and δ15N val-
ues. Here we show that the dentine δ13C and δ15N profiles of workhouse inmates dating
from the Great Irish Famine of the 19th century not only record the expected dietary change
from C3 potatoes to C4 maize, but when used together they also document prolonged nutri-
tional and other physiological stress resulting from insufficient sustenance. In the adults, the
influence of the maize-based diet is seen in the δ13C difference between dentine (formed in
childhood) and rib (representing an average from the last few years of life). The demon-
strated effects of stress on the δ13C and δ15N values will have an impact on the interpreta-
tions of diet in past populations even in slow-turnover tissues such as compact bone. This
technique also has applicability in the investigation of modern children subject to nutritional
distress where hair and nails are unavailable or do not record an adequate period of time.
Introduction
Famine was a regular occurrence in post-medieval, pre-Industrial Revolution Europe [1,2].
Where the population was mainly rural, any factor which reduced the quantity of food crops,
whether climate, military action, or pestilence, would have a devastating effect on the prices of

 food and the people who relied on the crops for their calories [3]. In the Great Famine of 1845–
46, an attempt was made by Sir Robert Peel to provide relief for the Irish by the importation of
maize (‘Indian meal’) from America. This unfamiliar food was unpopular, difficult to process
and cook: its yellow colour and effects on the intestines of the starving Irish led to it being
renamed ‘Peel’s Brimstone’[4]. The δ13C values of potatoes, a C3 plant and the main food crop
in Ireland prior to the Famine, and maize, a C4 plant which as a group are largely absent from
Ireland at this time, are measurably different and this isotopic shift offers the opportunity to
investigate dietary change in a population suffering from documented under-nutrition.
The stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen in bone collagen and bulk dentine collagen
have been used extensively over the past thirty years to characterise the childhood and adult
diets of archaeological individuals [5,6]. Bone collagen, because of its slow turnover rate, repre-
sents a long-term average of the adult diet which can, even in mature adults, date back to ado-
lescence [7]. In contrast, primary dentine is mineralised within 3–4 days of secretion and does
not remodel, so represents the diet at the time the tooth was growing [7,8]. Methodological
improvements have allowed the analysis of much smaller samples of human dentine, e.g. from
a maximum of five per tooth by Fuller et al. [8] to sections of collagen weighing 0.5mg [9],
which promise greater temporal resolution. While there are variations in the rate at which den-
tine is secreted as a permanent human tooth grows [10], the method of measuring 1mm hori-
zontal sections used in this study [11] will produce a rolling average of values. At this
resolution, and particularly as the method includes the removal of the circumpulpal dentine to
avoid contamination with secondary dentine, there should be no significant effect by assigning
the same timing to each section (See Fig 1).
The analysis of incremental dentine has allowed researchers to identify short-term changes
in the diet of individuals, and the resulting isotope profiles have been used for the first time
for the identification of migrants [11], a detailed analysis of the duration of breastfeeding [12],
responses to environmental conditions [13] and potential physiological responses to under-
nutrition [14]. The δ13C and δ15N values of body tissues reflect not only the diet of an individ-
ual, but can also be used as evidence for a period of nutritional stress when dietary intake is
insufficient for the individual's energy requirements [15,16]. Neuberger et al. [17] report the
segmental analysis of hair for forensic investigation of 15 adults and a child believed to have
died as the result of food deprivation. They found a trend for the δ15N values of the hair seg-
ments to rise as body mass index (BMI weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in
metres of the individual) reduced. This is consistent with earlier isotopic studies of the δ15N
values of hair from individuals deprived of food [15,18]. Neuberger et al. [17] also noticed a
trend amongst adults for δ13C values to be in phase with BMI. This observed drop in δ13C was
thought to be the result of the breakdown of body fat deposits, which are approximately 3‰
lower than other body tissues such as muscle [19] [17]; in order to maintain the levels of glu-
cose and ketones for energy during a prolonged fast, free fatty acids are obtained from the adi-
pose tissue [20] and may also be used for synthesis of new body tissues in the absence of
dietary carbohydrate. This observed fall in δ13C in nutritionally-stressed adults complements
the findings of Mekota et al. [15] who recorded a rise in δ13C and a fall in δ15N in the hair of
patients recovering from anorexia nervosa once re-feeding started and those of Lehn et al.
[21] in the identification of unknown individuals with a poor quality diet. In contrast, Neuber-
ger et al. [17] found the δ13C and δ15N co-varied in the same direction in hair from a 10
month-old child, suggesting a different metabolic pathway during food deprivation. Cherel
et al. [22] discussed the effect of the fasting of King penguins on their δ13C blood plasma val-
ues, interpreting a rise which they related to lipid content as denoting protein sparing and
lipid utilisation during the fasting period. Although energy-partitioning (the relative propor-
tion of energy derived from protein and fat stores) varies between individuals, and is

 influenced by the pre-starvation percentage of body fat to lean mass, both stores are utilised
during prolonged fasting [23].
In the absence of historical documents, identifying famine in a past population presents
challenges for the archaeologist. Archaeological contexts may yield evidence for short-term
deviations from the usual diet such as inclusion of unusual plants or alterations to butchery
practices [24]. Evidence for a catastrophic event in prehistory may hinge upon demography of
the cemetery population [25] or archaeological evidence for a single burial event. The osteo-
logical analysis of human remains for evidence of malnourishment such as rickets and scurvy
and indicators of systemic stress such as enamel hypoplasia, Harris lines and decreased stature
all contribute to the health status of individuals [26]. However, Wood et al. [27] pointed out
that those who succumb to a rapid death will not survive long enough for the body to produce
any bony markers for the causative agent. Those who die from acute diseases associated with
famine such as typhus and dysentery will thus appear to have been healthy [28]. Equally, any
change in δ13C and δ15N values resulting from a lack of food and leading shortly to death
(which can take as little as 2 months [29]) will not be measurable in bone collagen due to long
turnover times and averaging [7]. Collagen turnover in individuals who survived periods of

 famine will also eventually dilute and obscure any isotopic evidence for under-nutrition. This
led researchers to conclude it was not possible to identify famine with isotopic analysis of
archaeological bone [30,31]. However, starvation is not the most common cause of death [24]:
during periods of nutritional stress the population becomes more susceptible to infections and
thus it may be difficult to discriminate between an apparent famine and epidemic disease. Mor-
gan [32] concludes that in the absence of historical evidence, secure dating, and isotopic evi-
dence for dietary physiological changes, the combination of all other available archaeological
evidence may still not distinguish between catastrophic death from famine and from epidemic
disease, or from a combination of both.
As an historical event, the Great Irish Famine of 1845–52 has been extensively researched
and interpreted over the last 150 years. Historians and social commentators have used a wealth
of contemporary documents to explore the political, social and environmental factors which
combined to turn this particular series of crop failures into a devastating disaster. However,
Orser [33] carried out the first archaeological excavation of 19th-century Great-Famine-period
dwellings in Ireland in rural County Roscommon and made the point that notwithstanding all
the contemporary documents we know very little about the rural poor, and there have been few
subsequent opportunities to examine the archaeological record from this period in Ireland.
The excavation of the Kilkenny Union workhouse famine cemetery by Margaret Gowen & Co.
Ltd. from January to June 2006 allowed careful and respectful analysis of the remains of 970
individuals. The minute books for the workhouse indicate the burial ground was in use
between August 1847 and March 1851. The workhouse records from this period, and osteologi-
cal interpretations of the health and disease of the famine cemetery population, have been pub-
lished by Geber [34,35] and constitute an insightful analysis of the experiences of the Irish poor
at this time. This site represents a unique opportunity to examine the effects of an historical
famine on the victims both in terms of their observable bony pathology and of stable isotope
analysis of their skeletal tissues to investigate diet and physiology recorded in the δ13C and
δ15N values compared with the historical evidence. Such data from people who were nutrition-
ally deprived to such a degree is extremely rare and the opportunity to use their untold stories
is of significant import for the assessment of both modern and ancient individuals where nutri-
tional stress may be suspected and soft tissues are not available.
Materials and Methods
A single permanent tooth was collected from 20 individuals excavated from the Kilkenny
Union workhouse famine cemetery, designated numbers KUW 1 to 20. The stable isotope val-
ues from incremental dentine collagen were compared with those from the bulk rib bone colla-
gen reported in Beaumont et al. [36]. These individuals were chosen to provide a range of ages
and sex, but represent only a small sample of the 970 individuals recorded. Permission was
granted for the scientific analysis of these individuals by the Irish Antiquities section of the
National Museum of Ireland. All the skeletal remains were re-interred at the Famine Memorial
Garden at Goods Shed Square, McDonagh Junction shopping centre, Kilkenny, Ireland, in
2010.
Methods
In each case incremental dentine collagen was prepared from the full length of a single root or
a full longitudinal root section. The tooth notation, sex (if known) and age at death as deter-
mined by Geber [36] is recorded for each individual in Table 1 and the isotopic data shown in
Table 2. The incremental data for KUW 2, 3 and 8 and KUW 1, 4, 9, 12, 13, 14 and 16 have
been previously published [9, 14]. The teeth were cut into 1 mm sections [11] and an

 approximate age was assigned to each dentine segment [37]. This method allows us to investi-
gate isotopic changes over short periods, approximately 9 months in permanent teeth, although
due to the averaging of values (see Fig 1) there will be some attenuation of the profiles.
Collagen was prepared using the modified Longin method [38]. Surface debris was removed
by air-abrasion and samples were demineralised in 0.5M hydrochloric acid at 4°C. Each root
was then divided into 1mm sections using a scalpel. Each section was placed in sealed micro-
tubes, heated in pH3 acidified water at 70°C for 48 hours, allowing the collagen fibrils to dena-
ture. Filtration of dentine has been shown to be unnecessary due to the lack of exogenous
debris (compared to bone) and the very high collagen yields [9,11]. Samples were centrifuged
prior to freezing and freeze-drying. The dentine samples were combusted in a Thermo Flash
EA 1112 and the separated N2 and CO2 was introduced to a Delta plus XL via a Conflo III
interface. This instrument was used for dentine samples because it can analyse small (0.5 mg)
samples.
Samples were measured in duplicate in the University of Bradford Stable Light Isotope Lab-
oratory and compared with laboratory and international standards that were interspersed
throughout each analytical run (Table 3). The international standards were: IAEA 600, CH6,
CH7, N1 and N2. The laboratory standards, fish gelatin and bovine liver, were calibrated
against the international standards. The C:N ratios obtained from each dentine collagen sample
are within the range of 3.1–3.5 recommended by van Klinken [39]. This indicates well-pre-
served collagen that has not undergone diagenetic alteration. The yields from dentine were
between 10–19% by weight before demineralization. The results for both dentine and bone col-
lagen are expressed using the delta (δ) notation in parts per thousand (per mil or ‰) relative to
the international standards Vienna-PDB for δ13C and AIR for δ15N. The analytical error was
determined at ±0.2‰ (1sd) or better.

 Results and Discussion
The dentine isotope ratios from the adults reflect their childhood diet which is known from his-
torical sources to have been extremely restricted and dominated by potatoes supplemented
with a small amount of animal protein. The dentine δ13C values for the adult individuals range
between -21.7‰ and -19.5‰ (x = -20.5 +/- 0.3‰ 1sd, n = 13); the δ15N values range between
9.3‰ and 12.7‰ (x = 11.2 +/- 0.5‰ 1sd, n = 13). The intra-individual range of isotope ratios
is smaller: δ13C � 1.6‰; δ15N � 2.2‰. Although small, these ranges exceed analytical uncer-
tainty (i.e. +/-0.4‰ 2sd) and the δ13C and δ15N values co-vary as would be expected during
minor changes in dietary protein consumption during childhood and adolescence. For exam-
ple, KUW 1 exhibits low variation (δ13C = 0.8‰; δ15N = 1‰) in dentine isotope ratio profiles
between the ages of 0.5 and 9 years but an incremental δ15N rise of 1‰ (which exceeds analyti-
cal uncertainty at 2sd), between the ages of 5 and 9 years (Fig 2). The progressive nature of the
rise suggests this is a real if small change and not merely random analytical error. Whilst the
δ15N dentine (childhood) profile is analytically indistinguishable from the rib bone (adult)
value, this is not the case for δ13C which shows a ~3‰ increase from c. -20‰ in childhood to
-17.2‰ in later life. The rise in δ13C is not accompanied by a rise in δ15N and thus is most
likely to be recording a change from a predominantly C3 potato-based childhood diet to a diet
including C4 maize at some time between the age of 9 years and death more than 13 years later.

 Additional individual plots for adults from Kilkenny Union workhouse which show that their
childhood δ13C values reflecting a C3 potato-based predominantly range from -21‰ and
-20‰ are presented in S1, S2 and S3 Figs.
In contrast, the dentine isotope profiles of the seven children who died whilst their teeth
were forming, and which thus track diet up to death with increased temporal resolution, dis-
play much larger variations in δ13C and δ15N (Fig 3). The δ13C values for the children range
between -21.4‰ and -14.7‰ (x = -19.5 +/- 0.8‰ 1sd, n = 7); the δ15N values range between
9.2‰ and 14.3‰ (x = 10.9 +/- 0.5‰ 1sd, n = 7). The intra-individual range of isotope ratios is
the same for δ13C at � 6.7‰ and marginally smaller for δ15N at � 4.6‰. The large shifts in the
children’s δ13C isotope profiles demonstrate that, with the exception of KUW 10 (a nine year
old child), they changed their main calorie intake from C3 potatoes to C4 maize at some point
prior to death. For KUW 4, 11, 13, 14, 16 the δ13C profiles were rising immediately prior to
death. This is consistent with the documentary evidence relating to the maize-based diet pro-
vided in workhouses during the Great Famine [3]. The combined δ13C and δ15N profiles of
these children show that, as expected, the maize-based diet increases the δ13C values with
opposing covariance of the δ15N values (i.e. the fall in δ15N occurs at the same time as the rise in
δ13C), reflecting the change to the C4 plant-based diet (i.e. the maize pattern) and perhaps sug-
gesting a maize-based diet results in lower δ15N values. In Fig 3 the profiles from the children
are aligned with two known historical events: the introduction of maize imported from North
America in March 1846 and the closure of the cemetery in March 1851. Where possible, the
profiles are matched to the introduction of maize by aligning the first rise in δ13C with March
1846. In two cases (KUW 10 and KUW 12) this meant that the profile continued to death
beyond the closure of the cemetery, which was not possible. When those profiles are aligned
with death at 1851, the rise in δ13C appears to predict the dietary change, showing that there is
some error in the calculation of the age assignment of the dentine sections, or there is averaging
due to the overlapping developmental structures (see Fig 1). However, in all cases there is a rise
in δ15N just prior to the dietary change to maize (Fig 3). Moreover, the δ15N values in most
children rise just prior to death. The rises in δ15N are not due to a higher trophic level diet, as
δ13C should also rise (although to a much smaller extent); in all cases δ13C values remain stable
or fall, showing the opposite pattern of opposing co-variance (i.e. the famine pattern). Dietary
explanations for a rise in δ15N values without a corresponding rise in δ13C values such as the
consumption of freshwater fish or meat from animals raised in a forested environment should
be considered but these have not been historically documented for this population. Thus, this
pattern appears to be evidence for a period of nutritional stress prior to the introduction of
maize as a famine relief food. This is consistent with the findings of Neuberger et al., Lehn et al.
and Cherel et al. [17,21,22] that the recycling of body fat stores causes a fall in δ13C values in
body tissues. Huelseman et al. [40], during their controlled feeding experiment where terres-
trial foods were replaced with marine, found that the rise in δ15N values in hair keratin was
recorded more rapidly than for δ13C. Furthermore, the increase in δ15N was greater in the indi-
viduals with a higher rate of physical activity suggesting that the rise as a result of dietary
change was accompanied by a rise associated with nutritional stress.
Both patterns of opposing co-variance are visible in the profile of the juvenile KUW 4 (Fig
4) commencing with low δ13C: high δ15N of the famine pattern between the ages of 4 and 8
years of age and switching to high δ13C: low δ15N of the maize pattern between 8 years of age
and death. As with the adult KUW 1 (Fig 2), the δ15N value for the rib bone correlates well
with the dentine values (bone δ15N = 9.7‰, mean dentine δ15N = 10‰), and they are indistin-
guishable in the last c. 5 years of life. The δ15N value peaks at 10.7‰ at c. 6 years of age which
is only 1‰ different from the rib value but is preceded by an incremental rise and followed by
an incremental fall suggesting again that this is a subtle but analytically significant change. The

 shift in δ13C between dentine and rib is large: the dentine has a mean value of -21‰ (n = 10)
between the ages of 2 and 9 years but the δ13C rib value of -16.2‰ clearly reflects the shift to a
C4 maize diet between the ages of 8 and 9 years. Whilst the rib value falls short of the peri-mor-
tem dentine peak of -14.7‰, showing it was still in the process of equilibrating with the C4 diet
at death, it sits between the means of the last four increments and the last three increments, i.e.
-16.7‰ and -15.9‰ respectively, suggesting the rib value of this c. 13 year old child averages
the last c. 3 years of dietary inputs. Additional individual profiles for juveniles from Kilkenny
Union workhouse presented in S3 Fig show that, where there has been a C3 to C4 dietary
change prior to death, rib and final dentine increments can record different δ13C values where,
as in the case of KUW 4, the rib appears to be lagging behind the dentine (e.g. KUW 11,13,16)
or, somewhat inexplicably, predicting future dentine values (e.g. KUW 14).
The difference between the δ13C value of individual adult rib and mean dentine (Δ13C) var-
ies from 0.2‰ to 2.8‰ but is, in all cases, positive, i.e. later life values are higher than child-
hood values (Fig 5) although there is no significant correlation with age at death and Δ13C
(Pearson r = 0.43, p-value = 0.15). The δ13C mean of the ribs is significantly greater than the
mean of the bulk dentine (paired t-test p < 0.05, n = 13) and the data provide strong evidence
that short-term consumption of C4 maize has been variably recorded in the rib collagen
through bone turnover during the last few years of life whilst the dentine retains the C3 potato-

 based isotope values of the childhood diet (Fig 5 and S3 Fig). The retention of early life C3 iso-
tope values in the adult dentine is supported by the fact that virtually none of the adult dentine
δ13C values rise above -20‰, the dentine values for adults are significantly less variable than
those of the children (adult dentine mean -20.4‰ ± 0.4‰ 1sd; children dentine mean 19.6‰
± 1.5‰ 1sd, p < 0.05) and that the children's dentine mean is significantly greater than the
adult dentine mean (t-test p < 0.05).
As indicated above, the consumption of maize by the adults in the Kilkenny Union work-
house is recorded variably in the ribs and whilst there is no statistically significant correlation
with age at death in this relatively small group, it is difficult to conclude what other factors
such as onset of maize consumption, activity, nutrition and health may have impacted on the
visibility of maize consumption in the adult bones. Equally, the transition from potatoes to
maize visible within the dentine δ13C values of the children also appears to take several years
(e.g. Fig 4) because each sample of dentine, although of far higher temporal resolution than
bone, still does not represent a discrete time period but rather a running average due to current
sample size requirements and the pattern of appositional dentine growth (Fig 1) [11]. As a
result, a step-change in diet from C3 to C4 will manifest as a rising profile starting with the
increment that includes the first C4 influenced dentine in the innermost layer. This dentine will

 also be forming simultaneously in outer dentine layers nearer the tooth apex. If these layers
continue to build up with only C4-influenced dentine the profile further down the tooth, if not
arrested by death, will plateau at the new higher δ13C value. However appositional growth
means that the amplitude of a temporary dietary change within a profile will be attenuated and
the peak flattened as is suggested for the δ15N peak of KUW 4 that occurs between the ages of 5
and 7 years (Fig 4). Here, it is highly likely that the visible peak does not represent the highest
short-term δ15N dentine value because after this dentine layer was laid down, additional layers
would have been added with lower δ15N values reducing the averaged value. The true height of
the peak is therefore no longer visible at the current sampling resolution as KUW 4 survived
this period of stress. This strongly implies that a period of famine may manifest as what might
be reasonably considered a fairly minor (i.e. ~1‰) rise in δ15N. A further interpretive compli-
cation is that increments at the beginning and the end of a tooth profile may record more
extreme values because they are subject to only one-way averaging, i.e. dentine formed either
solely after or before the increment in question not both, and thus they will have a higher tem-
poral resolution. In the case of the final increments of incomplete tooth roots, such as that of
KUW 4 and the other juveniles in this study, the temporal resolution will be even greater
because the dentine has not yet reached its final thickness. For most incomplete teeth, the final
increment is extremely thin consisting of outer dentine layers only, and thus its isotope ratios
will not be ameliorated by dentine that would have been laid down in the future if the individ-
ual had survived and the tooth continued to completion. Turning this around, it also implies
that the onset of a dietary change from C3 to C4 will be heralded at an earlier age in the profiles
presented here than it actually occurred because the inner, later forming layers of dentine will
cause the profiles to rise. These observations suggest that similar dietary or physiological
changes may manifest differently in dentine isotope profiles depending on whether the change
occurred within a completed tooth root and was survived, or at the end of a profile in a tooth
where development was arrested at death. Temporary changes in δ13C as a result of a change in
diet or increases in δ15N as a result of famine may, therefore, be far more subtle and of sup-
pressed amplitude than might be anticipated or indeed obtained from the incomplete tooth
roots of children. Thinning the dentine of fully formed teeth from the pulp cavity prior to sec-
tioning should reduce the impact of later appositional deposition of dentine and thus increase
the temporal resolution of the isotope profiles.
The Great Irish Famine of 1845–52 was not the first major famine in Ireland nor was the
use of maize as a relief food in March 1846 the first major importation of maize to Ireland.
Crawford [41] demonstrates that maize was imported in quantity in 1801 and again in 1827 to
supply cheap food to the Irish poor. During 1827, when there were widespread crop failures,
Humphrey O’Sullivan, a schoolteacher in Callan, County Kilkenny, records in his diary that
'Indian meal' imported from America was being distributed in an attempt to “keep down the
cost of living for the poor” [41]. Whilst it is only possible to speculate about the actual cause of
death for the people buried in the Kilkenny Union workhouse cemetery because many individ-
uals died as a result of an inability to fight infection [42], the adult profiles show that some of
this workhouse population, who represent the poorest members of society at this time, appear
to have suffered from earlier periods of famine which have been recorded in dentine formed
during their childhood. The dietary history of Ireland since 1500 as documented by Clarkson
and Crawford [3] included many periods of food shortage whether arising from conflicts,
extreme weather conditions, or political mismanagement. It was always those with the least
entitlement to food who suffered the most [43]. It is possible, therefore, that older individuals
in the Kilkenny cemetery had survived earlier periods of food shortages in the half century pre-
ceding their death in the Kilkenny Union workhouse. KUW 5, an adult female whose teeth
would have been forming during the 1827 famine, shows both patterns of opposing co-variance

 in her dentine profile (Fig 6): the maize pattern between the ages of 4 and 7 years, when the
δ13C values temporarily rise above -20‰ coupled with a 1.4‰ fall in δ15N, followed by the
famine pattern where a 1.1‰ fall in δ13C values to within the C3 range is coupled with a 1.6‰
rise in δ15N denoting a further nutritional stress event between the ages of 8.5 and 12 years.
The later-life values of the rib suggest both δ13C and δ15N are raised above those expected for a
nutritionally sufficient potato-dominated C3 diet in the years before death.
Conclusion
This study is the first to use the stable isotope analysis of nitrogen and carbon in human den-
tine to identify changes related to a well-documented historical period of famine. These data
are a poignant reminder of the extreme conditions suffered by the children buried at Kilkenny,
but also clearly demonstrate that the intervention provided by the introduction of maize
allowed many to recover: their nitrogen isotope ratios return to dietary rather than stress levels,
and they survived beyond the dietary change. The ability of the human body to adapt to nutri-
tional deprivation and survive, returning to homeostasis, is clear within these profiles.
Although the change in diet from a C3 to a C4-based diet is recorded in the isotope ratios of
the adult rib bone collagen, it is difficult to resolve the age at which this occurred because of
averaging as a result of bone turnover. Using evidence from the dentine collagen δ13C and

and lower δ13C (famine pattern of opposing covariance) in the dentine profiles of the children
is marked by the return to lower δ15N values and higher δ13C in the maize pattern of opposing
covariance. Short-term δ13C and δ15N changes in dentine resulting from physiological, in this
case specifically nutritional, stress has not previously been demonstrated in an historical popu-
lation where the records of the period of famine can be related to individuals who suffered. Fur-
ther work needs to be undertaken to refine the ageing of each increment, both chronological
age and the period of time represented, and whether partially mineralised teeth need ageing dif-
ferently to complete ones. Nonetheless, this study shows that using incremental dentine colla-
gen δ13C and δ15N analysis it is possible to identify periods of physiological stress such as
famine in both adult and juvenile skeletons if it occurred during tooth development, i.e. up to
approximately 23 years of age. This could have important forensic and archaeological applica-
tions for the identification of populations and individuals for whom nutritional stress may
have contributed to their death.

S3 Fig. Incremental dentine carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotope ratio profiles for
KUW 11, 13, 14 and 16 showing that where there has been a C3 to C4 dietary change prior
to death, rib and final dentine increments can record different δ13C values. Analytical
uncertainty is shown at +/- 0.4‰ (2sd).
