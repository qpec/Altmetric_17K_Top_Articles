IMPORTANCE The death of a close relative is associated with an increased mortality risk
among the bereaved, but much less is known about the potential association of the death of a
sibling in childhood with mortality in this population.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association between sibling death in childhood and subsequent
mortality risk.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based cohort study of 5 005 029
participants evaluated linked national registers in Denmark (January 1, 1973, through
December 31, 2009) and Sweden (January 1, 1973, through December 31, 2008). A total of
2 060 354 Danish and 2 944 675 Swedish children who survived the first 6 months of their life
were included. We excluded 14 children who died of the same external cause as their siblings
within 30 days. Data were analyzed from November 2, 2015, through October 14, 2016.
EXPOSURES Participants were classified as exposed if a sibling died in childhood (age <18
years).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Poisson regression was used to estimate mortality rate ratio
(MRR) with the exposure as a time-varying variable.
RESULTS Among the 55 818 participants who experienced sibling death in childhood (51.5%
male and 48.5% female; median age at loss, 7.0 [interquartile range, 3.3-12.1] years), all-cause
mortality risk was increased by 71% (MRR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.57-1.87) during the follow-up of 37
years. The excess mortality risk was observed for groups with specific causes of death, and
the higher MRRs were found when the sibling pairs died of the same cause (death due to
disease [MRR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.87-2.49]; death due to external cause [MRR, 1.91; 95% CI,
1.54-2.37]). The increased mortality risk after sibling death was seen across the follow-up
period, regardless of the age at bereavement and the type of death among bereaved siblings,
but the magnitude of association was stronger during the first year after sibling death (MRR,
2.51; 95% CI, 1.79-3.54). Higher MRRs were found among sibling pairs with the same sex
(MRR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.70-2.18) and close age (MRR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.58-2.37).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Bereavement in childhood because of the death of a sibling
was associated with an increased risk for mortality in the short and long term. Health care
professionals should be aware of individuals’vulnerability due to sibling death, especially for
sibling pairs of close age or the same sex. Social and health care support may help to minimize
the potential adverse effects on the bereaved sibling.

ereavement caused by the death of a close relative is

increased risk for mortality and adverse health outcomes
has been observed among bereaved spouses, parents, and
children.2-5
Estimates suggest that nearly 8% of individuals in the
United States experienced a sibling death in childhood,6 but
much less is known about the health consequences to the sur-
vivors.Siblingrelationshiptendstobethelongestandthemost
intimate in families; thus, the death of a sibling can be a dev-
astatinglifeevent.7PreviousSwedishstudies8-11foundthatsib-
lingdeathinadulthoodmightaffectthebereavedsibling’
smor-
tality. However, these studies were restricted to adult siblings,
andtheexperienceofpsychologicalstressduetoasiblingdeath
in childhood may vary compared with that due to a sibling
death in adulthood. Previous studies have suggested that the
experience of a sibling death in childhood is associated with
anincreasedriskfordevelopingpsychosocialdistressandmen-
tal disorders later in life.12-17 However, to our knowledge, no
study has investigated the association of sibling death in child-
hood with subsequent mortality in bereaved siblings with a
long follow-up.
The severity of this bereavement is expected to depend on
the closeness of the siblings.18-20 We hypothesized that expe-
riencing a sibling death in childhood could lead to an excess
mortality risk in the surviving children, particularly for sib-
ling pairs with a small age difference and of the same sex. We
examined the association between sibling death in childhood
and subsequent mortality and evaluated effect modification
by the siblings’sex and age differences.
Methods
Study Population
The unique personal identification number in Scandinavian
countries permits accurate linkage of personal data between
national registers,21 and we conducted this population-based
cohortstudybasedonlinkednationalregistersinDenmarkand
Sweden.22 We linked live births in Denmark (January 1, 1973,
through December 31, 2004) and Sweden (January 1, 1973,
through December 31, 2006) with their mothers and thereaf-
teridentifiedtheirsiblings.Weexcludedthosewhodiedwithin
the first 6 months of life, because infant mortality in this pe-
riod is likely attributable to preterm birth, malformations, or
neonatal complications.23,24 We included only children who
had at least 1 sibling in childhood (age <18 years). We also ex-
cluded 14 children who died within 30 days of the same ex-
ternal cause as their siblings (of whom 11 [79%] died of trans-
port accidents, for which both siblings might die due to the
same accident). Our study included 5 005 029 children in the
final analysis. The study was approved in Denmark by the Data
Protection Agency and the Research Ethics Committee of the
Central Region, and in Sweden by the Research Ethics Com-
mittee at the Karolinska Institute. The study was based on de-
identified data, for which the ethics committees do not re-
quire informed consent.
Exposure
All index children were included in the unexposed group at the
start of follow-up (6 months after birth). The exposure was a
time-varying variable. An index child would be changed to the
exposed group when he or she was aged 6 months to younger
than 18 years and had a sibling who died at any age. The other
children remained in the unexposed group. Each child was fol-
lowed up until death, emigration, or the end of the study (De-
cember 31, 2009, in Denmark, and December 31, 2008, in Swe-
den),whichevercamefirst.Ifmultiplesiblingsdiedatdifferent
times, the exposure time started at the time of the death of the
first deceased sibling. The causes of death were retrieved from
the Danish and the Swedish cause of death registers22 and
coded using the International Classification of Diseases, Eighth
Revision (ICD-8), International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision (ICD-9), and International Statistical Classification of
Diseases and Health Related Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-
10). The causes of death were divided into deaths due to dis-
eases (ICD-8 codes 000-799, ICD-9 codes 000-799, and ICD-10
codes A00-R99) and external causes of death (ICD-8 codes
E800-E999, ICD-9 codes E800-E999, and ICD-10 codes V01-
Y98) according to the European Shortlist Causes of Death.25
Outcomes
The main outcomes were all-cause mortality, cause-specific
mortality, and mortality by type of death (death due to dis-
eases or external causes of death as defined above). We also in-
vestigated the following causes of death by groups: neo-
plasms; endocrine, nutritional, and/or metabolic diseases;
diseases of the nervous system; diseases of the circulatory sys-
tem; transportation accidents; suicide and intentional self-
harm; and other diseases (ICD-8, ICD-9, and ICD-10 codes are
shown in eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Covariates
Potential confounders were selected a priori based on previ-
ous literature4: preterm birth (<37 or ≥37 weeks), birth weight
(<2500, 2500-3249, 3250-3999, or ≥4000 g), singleton birth
(yes or no), parity (1, 2, or ≥3), Apgar score at 5 minutes (0-6,
7-9, or 10), maternal age (≤26, 27-30, or ≥31 years), maternal
education (0-9, 10-14, or ≥15 years), maternal social status (not
in the labor market, unskilled worker, skilled or white collar
worker, or top-level status), maternal smoking during preg-
nancy (yes or no), country of birth (Denmark or Sweden), sex
Key Points
Question Does sibling death in childhood lead to increased
mortality in bereaved individuals?
Findings In this population-based cohort study, a sibling death in
childhood was associated with a 71% increased all-cause mortality
risk among bereaved persons. The higher mortality risks were
found in the first year and among same-sex sibling pairs or sibling
pairs with a small age difference.
Meaning The minimization of potential adverse effects of sibling
death in childhood is important, especially in the first year and for
sibling pairs of close age and same sex.

15-19, 20-25, 25-30, or >30 years), and calendar period (1973-
1975 or in a 5-year interval during 1976-2010). The age of be-
reaved siblings and calendar year period were treated as time-
varyingvariables.Amissingindicatorwascreatedforamissing
value of each variable. Information on maternal and birth char-
acteristics were retrieved from the medical birth registers in
Denmark and Sweden,26,27 whereas socioeconomic factors
were retrieved from the Danish Integrated Database for Lon-
gitudinal Labour Market Research, the Danish Civil Registry
System, the Swedish Multigeneration Registry, and the Swed-
ish Registry of Total Population and Population Changes.22
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed from November 2, 2015, through October
14, 2016. We used a log-linear Poisson regression model to es-
timate the mortality rate ratios (MRRs) with 95% CIs to inves-
tigate the association of sibling death in childhood with sub-
sequent mortality of the surviving sibling. A child who
emigrated during the follow-up was censored at the time of
emigration. Exposed participants who died were divided into
the following 2 subgroups: those who died of the same cause
as their sibling and those who died of a different cause, with
additional adjustment for the index child’
s Charlson comor-
bidity index28 to account for comorbidity. When cause-
specific mortality and mortality by type of death were esti-
mated,deathfromothercauseswasconsideredasacompeting
event and treated as a censored case. The association be-
tween sibling death and mortality was examined across sub-
groups according to the age when the child experienced the
sibling’
s death (<6, 6-11, or 12-17 years) and time since the sib-
ling’
s death (<1, 1-4, 5-9, 10-14, or ≥15 years). Because siblings
with the same sex or a small age difference in general are so-
cially closer,20 they may experience greater effects after be-
reavement. We therefore also investigated the association by
age difference (<2, 2-5, 6-11, or ≥12 years) and sex difference
between the deceased and bereaved siblings.
Inaddition,basedondataavailabilityofcovariatesandICD
code changes, subanalyses were performed that were re-
strictedtochildrenbornafter1978,1980,1982,1987,1991,1994,
and 1997 and in children with information for all covariates
(complete case analysis). Additional analyses were performed
with children stratified by country of birth. We also per-
formed analyses through inclusion of all children after birth.
The analyses were performed using STATA/SE (version 12;
StataCorp) and SAS (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Inc) software.
Results
Atotalof55 818of5 005 029participants(1.1%;51.5%maleand
48.5% female) experienced the death of a sibling in childhood
(from6monthsafterbirthtothedaybefore18yearsofage).The
medianageofbereavedpersonsatthetimeoflosswas7.0years
(interquartile range, 3.3-12.1 years). Mothers of bereaved per-
sons were more likely to be young and to have low educational
levelsandhighparityandsmokedmoreoftenduringpregnancy.
Compared with unexposed individuals, exposed individuals
moreoftenwereofmultiplebirths,werebornpreterm,andhad
a low birth weight and low 5-minute Apgar scores (Table 1).
During the follow-up to 37 years, 534 participants died in
the bereaved group and 25 591 died in the nonbereaved group.
Compared with those who did not experience sibling loss, the
bereavedgrouphadanincreasedall-causemortalityrisk(MRR,
1.71; 95% CI, 1.57-1.87). The exposed group had increased all-
cause mortality when their siblings died of disease (MRR, 1.72;
95%CI,1.55-1.90)oranexternalcause(MRR,1.65;95%CI,1.40-
1.94)(Table2).Bereavedparticipantsalsohadexcessivedeaths
from disease (MRR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.70-1.21) and external cause
(MRR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.36-1.76). A stronger association was ob-
served if bereaved participants had the same cause of death
(disease or external cause) as the deceased sibling (Table 2).
Increased mortality risks were found among bereaved per-
sons after additional adjustment for their comorbid diseases
irrespective of the type of deaths among sibling pairs (eTable
2 in the Supplement).
Next, we investigated cause-specific mortality. As ex-
pected, individuals who experienced the death of a sibling also
hadaparticularlyhighriskfordeathfromthesamecauseastheir
deceased sibling (eTable 1 in the Supplement). For example,
the relative risks were the highest for endocrine, nutritional,

 and metabolic diseases (MMR, 158.08; 95% CI, 97.19-257.13);
diseases of the nervous system (MMR, 24.90; 95% CI, 14.68-
42.24); and diseases of the circulatory system (MMR, 44.90;
95% CI, 18.57-108.53). We also found a much higher mortality
risk for suicide among individuals whose deceased siblings
died of suicide (MMR, 8.01; 95% CI, 5.34-12.00).
With respect to time of follow-up, we observed increased
MRRs of sibling death associated with subsequent mortality
in the short and long term regardless of the age at bereave-
ment and type of death among the bereaved group (Figure),
but the strongest association was seen in the first year after sib-
ling death (MRR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.79-3.54). For external causes
of death, the magnitude of association was notably stronger
during the first year of follow-up (MRR, 8.58; 95% CI, 3.99-
18.48). The proportions of deaths from external causes tended
to decrease with the increasing length of follow-up. For
death from disease, the association also appeared to be
stronger in the first year after bereavement (MRR, 2.06; 95%
CI, 1.39-3.04) and the estimated effect seemed to persist
into older ages.
When estimating the effect of sex difference between sib-
ling pairs, we observed a higher effect size in same-sex sib-
ling pairs (MRR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.70-2.18) than in opposite-sex
pairs(MRR,1.53;95%CI,1.33-1.77)(Table3).Theanalysesstrati-
fiedbysexofthebereavedpersonsrevealedthatbereavedmale
participants had a higher mortality risk than bereaved female
participants regardless of whether the deceased sibling was a
male or female. For bereaved female participants who died of
an external cause, we did not observe an increased mortality
risk after sibling death. The strength of association was stron-
ger in close age group (<2 years) (Table 4), particularly for be-
reaved participants who died of external cause (MRR, 2.04;
95% CI, 1.50-2.77).
In sensitivity analyses, a fine categorization of age and cal-
endar year in 1-year interval (eTable 3 in the Supplement) and
inclusion of all children after birth (eTable 4 in the Supple-
ment) did not essentially change the result. The overall MRRs
from the separate analyses restricted to singletons, individu-
als with a gestational age of at least 37 weeks, a birth weight
of at least 2500 g, and a 5-minute Apgar score of 10; to those
withcompletecaseanalysis;andtoindividualsbornafter1978,
1980, 1982, 1987, 1991, 1994, and 1997 were consistent with
the results from the main analyses. The results of the analy-
ses stratified by countries were largely similar in the Danish
(MRR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.57-2.02) and Swedish (MRR, 1.62; 95%
CI, 1.44-1.83) populations. The analyses on sex difference be-
tween sibling pairs restricted to singletons yielded similar re-
sults (eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In this large population-based cohort study, we found that loss
of a sibling in childhood was associated with an increased mor-
tality risk later in life. The increased mortality persisted across
the follow-up period, irrespective of age at bereavement and
typeofdeath,butthemagnitudeofassociationwasstrongdur-
ing the first year after sibling death. The higher MRRs were
found when the siblings had the same cause of death or the
siblings had the same sex or a small age difference.7,19,29

also indirectly through parents’and other family members’re-
action to the deceased siblings.30 Studies examining potential
adverse effects of sibling death in childhood are sparse, com-
pared with research on parental death in childhood or sibling
deathinadulthood,probablyowingtofeweravailabledata.The
magnitudeofgriefduetosiblingdeathinchildhoodcanbecom-
parable to that due to parental death in childhood or sibling
death in adulthood.4,5 In fact, we found that the overall mor-
talityriskaftersiblingdeathinchildhoodwasslightlyhigherthan
overall mortality risk after parental death in childhood.4 A pre-
vious study also indicated that the death of a sibling in child-
hood was associated with a higher risk for serious emotional
and/or behavioral problems than parental death.16
We observed a stronger association when both the de-
ceased sibling and the bereaved person died of disease or an
external cause. Similar patterns have also been reported for pa-
rental death in childhood4,5 and sibling death in adulthood.10,11
With regard to cause-specific mortality from diseases of the
endocrine,nutritional,andmetabolicsystems;thenervoussys-
tem; and the circulatory system among bereaved partici-
pants, we found notably larger MRRs when their deceased sib-
ling died of the same cause. This finding may be attributed to
shared family environmental exposures and genetic suscep-
tibility. The association for sibling pairs who both died of an
external cause might be more complex and could reflect the
interplay of genetics and social or environmental factors. On
the other hand, we also observed an increased mortality risk
among bereaved persons if their sibling died of a discordant
cause, although of smaller magnitude. Adjustment for comor-
bidity did not essentially change these risks. An increased risk
fordiscordantcausesofdeathislesssusceptibletogeneticcon-
founding, and the finding may reflect an association with be-
reavement. The psychological stress after bereavement has
been proposed to play a significant role.5,22
A stronger association was seen when the sibling pairs had
the same sex or a smaller difference in age. Siblings of the same
sex and close age tend to have more frequent interactions and
experience greater feelings of warmth and closeness.18-20 At
the same time, perceived conflict is expected to be great in sib-
lings of the same sex or a close age,18,31 which might lead to
the guilt of the surviving siblings about the death of their sib-
ling. The resulting guilt may contribute to further distress and
increase the vulnerability of the surviving siblings.32 Our find-
ing that bereaved male participants had a higher mortality risk
than bereaved female participants was consistent with previ-
ous research4 in which boys who experienced the death of a
parent in childhood had a higher mortality risk than did girls.
However, a study using Swedish data11 found a higher mortal-
ity risk among female participants who experienced the death
of a sibling in adulthood than among male participants. Ad-
ditional research is needed to explore the underlying reasons
for these differences.
We found that the increased mortality persisted across the
follow-up period. The strength of grief caused by the death of
a sibling is generally expected to weaken over time, but the
death of a sibling could be a long-lasting stressor leading to al-
lostatic load or long-term grief.33,34 Bereaved persons were
foundtohaveaprominentlyincreasedmortalityrateinthefirst
year after their siblings’deaths, particularly if bereaved per-
sons died of external causes. The posttraumatic stress of the
bereaved parents may be directly related to the quality of care
and support that the bereaved individuals subsequently re-
ceived during the very early time after their siblings’deaths.
This process could lead to an immediate adverse health
consequence.35-37 Our results also showed that most deaths in
the first year after bereavement were attributable to external
causes. In contrast, a Swedish study11 showed that the asso-
ciation between sibling death in adulthood and mortality was

 stronger among bereaved individuals in the long term than in
the short term (>1 and ≤1 year since sibling death, respec-
tively). The discrepant results may stem from whether the sib-
ling death occurred in childhood or adulthood. In previous re-
search on mortality after parental death in childhood,4 MRRs
for diseases tended to increase during follow-up, whereas the
highest MRR for external causes was seen at the beginning of
follow-up. The potential mechanisms underlying the differ-
encesofhowanindividualreactstoparentalandsiblingdeaths
remain unknown.
Strengths and Limitations
Themainstrengthofourstudyistheuseoflarge-scaleregister-
based data from Denmark and Sweden. The population-
based cohort study, which includes all individuals from both
countries and provides accurate information on mortality, ex-
posure, and other covariates, eliminates the possibility of
recall bias or selection bias. Also, we adjusted for a broad
range of potential confounders. The sufficient sample size
with a long follow-up period provides a unique opportunity
to investigate cause-specific mortality and evaluate long-
term consequences of sibling death by the age at bereave-
ment and type of death.
Limitations must also be noted. We do not have data on
shared social environment and family characteristics
between sibling pairs, which might help to further elucidate
the underlying mechanisms linking sibling death and subse-
quent mortality among the bereaved individuals. Although
associations were found in increased mortality risks for
death from different causes among sibling pairs, we cannot
rule out the possibility of residual confounding by unmea-
sured confounders. Furthermore, an interplay between
bereavement and other factors may exist, including stress
and family or social factors (such as individuals’socioeco-
nomic and/or psychosocial characteristics, parental marital
status, and quality of the marital relationship). However,
some of these variables are not well defined, and few are
available in our data set. Additional research is required to
understand the mediating or moderating effects of these fac-
tors, which will broaden the perspective on the mechanism
and inform the design of intervention. In addition, although
we have a large cohort from 2 countries, numbers of events
are small in some cause-specific mortality groups, especially
in the analyses examining the same or discordant causes of
death within sibling pairs.
Conclusions
Experiencing a sibling death in childhood was associated with
short-andlong-termincreasedmortalityrisks.Healthcarepro-
fessionals should be aware of children’
s vulnerability after ex-
periencing sibling death, especially for same-sex sibling pairs
and sibling pairs with close age. Social support may help to re-
duce the level of grief and minimize potential adverse health
effects on the bereaved individuals.
