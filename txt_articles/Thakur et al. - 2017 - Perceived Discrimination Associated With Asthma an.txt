BACKGROUND: Asthma disproportionately affects minority populations and is associated with
psychosocial stress such as racial/ethnic discrimination. We aimed to examine the association
of perceived discrimination with asthma and poor asthma control in African American and
Latino youth.
METHODS: We included African American (n ¼ 954), Mexican American (n ¼ 1,086), other
Latino (n ¼ 522), and Puerto Rican Islander (n ¼ 1,025) youth aged 8 to 21 years from the
Genes-Environments and Admixture in Latino Americans study and the Study of African
Americans, Asthma, Genes, and Environments. Asthma was defined by physician diagnosis,
and asthma control was defined based on the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
guidelines. Perceived racial/ethnic discrimination was assessed by the Experiences of
Discrimination questionnaire, with a focus on school, medical, and public settings. We
examined the associations of perceived discrimination with each outcome and whether
socioeconomic status (SES) and global African ancestry modified these associations.
RESULTS: African American children reporting any discrimination had a 78% greater odds of
experiencing asthma (OR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.33-2.39) than did those not reporting discrimination.
Similarly, African American children faced increased odds of poor asthma control with any
experience of discrimination (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.42-2.76) over their counterparts not reporting
discrimination. These associations were not observed among Latino children. We observed het-
erogeneity of the association between reports of discrimination and asthma according to SES, with
reports of discrimination increasing the odds of having asthma among low-SES Mexican Amer-
ican youth (interaction P ¼ .01) and among high-SES other Latino youth (interaction P ¼ .04).
CONCLUSIONS: Perceived discrimination is associated with increased odds of asthma and
poorer control among African American youth. SES exacerbates the effect of perceived
discrimination on having asthma among Mexican American and other Latino youth.

 Racial/ethnic discrimination, an interpersonal form of
racism, is characterized as differential treatment or
biased attitudes directed toward individuals on the sole
basis of their race, color, national or ethnic origin, or
immigrant status.1 These experiences are known to elicit
emotional responses, ranging from anger and social
rejection to chronic vigilance,2-4 resulting in a concern of
constant harm5 and thus a source of psychosocial stress.6
Given the complex history of racial/ethnic relations in
the United States,7 the prevalence and severity of
discriminatory experiences varies across groups, with
African Americans and Latinos being more affected.8,9
Discrimination has been linked to poor mental health
outcomes, including depression10 and substance abuse,11
in youth. Unlike the well-known association between
perceived discrimination and physical health in
adults,12,13 this association is less known in children.14,15
Asthma, a common childhood condition, varies across
racial/ethnic groups, with African American and Puerto
Rican children carrying the greatest burden.16,17
Evidence suggests that psychosocial stress is an
important contributor to asthma exacerbations.18 In
fact, the Black Women’s Health Study demonstrated
that women scoring in the highest quartile of perceived
discrimination had an increased incidence of adult-onset
asthma.19 However, the role of discrimination in
childhood asthma has not been well established.
In addition to an individual’s race/ethnicity,9,20
socioeconomic status (SES) may also impact the
perception of discrimination in everyday experiences.21
SES may shape the exposure to racially biased treatment
in receiving and accessing medical care22,23 and to
environmental risk factors.24,25 Therefore, we expect that
the relationship between perceived discrimination and
asthma may vary with SES. Moreover, within a racial/
ethnic group, the experiences of discrimination may vary
widely based on an individual’s skin color. Therefore,
African ancestry, a known contributor to skin color,26,27
may affect the degree of discrimination an individual may
encounter.28 African ancestry is also associated with
asthma and worse pulmonary function in African
Americans and Latinos.29,30 Thus, it is possible that
African ancestry may modify the role of experiences of
discrimination on asthma-related outcomes.
Our study examined the association of perceived
discrimination with asthma outcomes in a multicenter
case-control study of African American and Latino
youth in the mainland United States and Puerto Rico.
Because asthma and discrimination vary with race/
ethnicity, these associations are examined within each
racial/ethnic group.14-17 In addition, we aimed to study
whether African ancestry and SES modified the
associations between perceived discrimination and each
asthma outcome examined (having asthma and poor
asthma control).
Methods
Study Population
Participants are from the Genes-Environment and Admixture in
Latino Americans (GALA II) study and the Study of African
Americans, Asthma, Genes, and Environments (SAGE II). These are
identical asthma case-control studies designed to examine complex
genetic and socioenvironmental contributors to asthma prevalence
and morbidity. The GALA II and SAGE II recruited Latino and
African American youth, respectively, with and without asthma aged
8 to 21 years of age from the mainland United States (San Francisco
Bay Area, Houston, Chicago, and New York) and Puerto Rico (San
Juan,
Puerto
Rico)

 (GALA II) or African American (SAGE II) to be eligible for the study.
Further details regarding eligibility criteria for the studies are described
elsewhere.25 Written age-appropriate informed consent/assent was
obtained from all participants and their legal guardians. The
University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and each study site’s
institutional review board (IRB) approved the SAGE II/GALA II
protocol (SAGE II UCSF-IRB No. 10-02877, Reference No. 155745;
GALA II UCSF-IRB No. 10-00889, Reference No.164561).
Outcome Assessments
Asthma: Asthma was defined by physician diagnosis and report of
symptoms and medication use within the 2 years prior to recruitment.
Within each catchment area, control subjects were frequency matched
to case subjects by the hospital or community clinic site of recruitment.
Eligible control subjects had no reported history of asthma, lung
disease, or chronic illness and no reported symptoms of wheezing or
shortness of breath (e-Table 1).
Asthma control: The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
(NHLBI) definition of asthma control is a composite score and the
accepted standard to measure control.31 Asthma control was derived
from information collected through a modified version of the 1978
American Thoracic Society–Division of Lung Diseases Epidemiology
Questionnaire on symptoms, nighttime awakening, interference with
normal activities, and rescue medication use during the week prior
to participant recruitment and interview, as well as lung function
measurements.32 Asthma control was defined for this analysis as
controlled, partially controlled, or poorly controlled33 (e-Table 2).
Assessment of Perceived Discrimination
Perceived discrimination was ascertained using a modified version of
the Experiences of Discrimination (EOD) questionnaire by asking
selected questions directed to the participant, with the parent/
caretaker’s
permission
and
input.34
Consistent
with
previous
studies,14,35 we included questions pertinent to pediatric populations:
“Have you ever experienced discrimination, been prevented from
doing something, or been hassled or made to feel inferior, in any of
the following situations because of your race, ethnicity, color, or
language: (1) at school, (2) getting medical care, (3) getting services
in a store or restaurant, and (4) on the street or in a public setting?
The choice for each question was yes or no. Experiences of
discrimination were defined as none or any (affirmative answer to at
least one situation) and also categorized as never (negative answer to
all four situations), rarely (affirmative answer to one or two
situations), and often (affirmative answer to three or more situations).36
Covariates
Race/ethnicity was categorized as follows: African American, Mexican
American, Puerto Rican, and other Latino (e-Appendix 1). For Latinos,
the mother’s preferred spoken language was included as a confounder.
In addition, for other Latino participants, a variable capturing the child’s
Latino subgroup (ie, multiple Latino origin, Central American, South
American, or Caribbean) was considered to account for variation within
the category. Recruitment site was included as a covariate.
Informed by previous studies,33,36 age, sex, current and in utero smoke
exposure (ie, maternal smoking during pregnancy), history of
breastfeeding, early-life daycare attendance, and reports of visible
water damage or mold were considered confounders for the analyses.
To capture SES, we used a composite index37,38 composed of the
following variables: maternal education, reported annual household
income, and insurance status. Each participant’s
ancestry was
determined using the software program package ADMIXTURE and
assuming three ancestral populations (African, Native American, and
European). We focused on African ancestry and classified individuals
as high/low ancestry using the population mean as a cut point for
each racial/ethnic group (e-Appendix 1).
For participants with asthma, the brief medication questionnaire39 was
used to ascertain reported controller medication use and included this
variable as a covariate when examining asthma control. Controller
medication use was defined as the report of inhaled corticosteroid,
leukotriene inhibitor, or long-acting beta-agonist use in the 2 weeks
prior to recruitment.
As of 2014, of the 1,370 and 4,236 eligible participants in SAGE II and
GALA II, respectively, we excluded those with missing info on
discrimination (n ¼ 542), SES (n ¼ 1,121), global African ancestry
(n ¼ 315), or other covariate (n ¼ 41). These exclusions yielded final
analytical sample sizes of 954 for SAGE II and 2,633 for GALA II.
When compared with participants included in the analysis, excluded
participants were more likely to be older (13.9 years vs 12.6 years;
P < .001), to report current tobacco smoke exposure (26.0% vs 22.1%;
P < .001), to be Puerto Rican Islander (38.5% vs 28.6%; P < .001), and
to have asthma (39.6% vs 32.6%; P < .001).
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics for case subjects and control subjects were
examined according to race/ethnicity. Differences and associations
were determined using the Student t test for continuous variables
with a normal distribution, the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous
nonnormally
distributed
variables,
and
the
c2square
test
for
categorical variables.
We used logistic regression models to quantify the association between
the report of perceived discrimination (none/any) and asthma status
(asthma yes/no) in each racial/ethnic group. This analysis was
repeated with severity of discrimination (never, rarely, often) as an
ordinal variable to examine for linear trend. Covariates significantly
associated with asthma status (P < .2) were included in the final
model. To determine whether the association between perceived
discrimination (none vs any) and asthma varies with SES and
proportion of African ancestry, interaction terms were tested in the
final model for each racial/ethnic group.
After meeting the proportional assumption in each racial/ethnic group,
ordinal logistic regression was used to estimate the association between
perceived discrimination (none/any) with asthma control (controlled,
partially
controlled,
and
poorly
controlled
asthma)
among
participants with asthma (e-Appendix 1). This analysis was repeated
with severity of discrimination (never, rarely, often) as an ordinal
variable to examine for linear trend. Finally, interaction terms of
perceived
discrimination
with
SES
and
proportion
of
African
ancestry were tested in the final model for each racial/ethnic group.
Significance of main effects and interaction effects were determined
at P ¼ .05. All analyses were conducted with R, version 3.3.0.40
Results
Baseline Study Characteristics
Participants with asthma were younger and more likely to
be male subjects compared with participants without
asthma, regardless of racial/ethnic group (Table 1).
African American participants with asthma were more
likely to be from low-income households and have a low
SES composite score, be under-insured and report greater
discrimination than their counterparts without asthma

 (all P < .05). For Mexican Americans, those with asthma
were more likely to be of high SES, have mothers with
higher educational attainment and have better health
insurance coverage (all P < .05) than those without
asthma. No associations with SES composite index were
observed in the other Latino or Puerto Rican groups.
Reports of discrimination by situation and asthma status
for each race/ethnic group are presented in e-Table 3.
Asthma Probability
After adjusting for age, sex, current and in utero
tobacco exposure, SES, global African ancestry, and
study site, we found that African American children
reporting any perceived discrimination had a
78% increased odds of having asthma (OR, 1.78;
95% CI, 1.33-2.39) compared with those denying
discriminatory experiences (Fig 1). This association
was not observed among the Latino subgroups. Only
among African American children we observed
increased odds of having asthma as reports of
discrimination increased (P for trend, < .001) (Fig 2).
For Latino subgroups, see e-Figures 1-3.
We examined whether the association between
perceived discrimination and having asthma differed
across the SES composite categories (low, middle, high)
for each racial/ethnic group. Significant heterogeneity
was observed among Mexican American and other
Latino participants (P for interaction, .01 and .04,
respectively) (Table 2). For Mexican Americans, we
observed a 65% increased odds of asthma with perceived
discrimination only among low-SES children (OR, 1.65;

 95% CI, 1.09-2.50). Conversely, among other Latino
children, perceived discrimination was associated with
increased odds of asthma only among those with high
SES (OR, 3.09; 95% CI, 1.03-10.1).
We observed no heterogeneity of the association
between perceived discrimination and having asthma
according to global African ancestry for any racial/
ethnic group (high vs low; P for interaction $ .42)
(e-Table 4). However, the association between perceived
discrimination and asthma was observed only among
African American children classified as having high
global African ancestry (e-Table 4).
Asthma Control
African American participants with asthma were observed
to have a 97% greater odds of poor asthma control
associated with any report of perceived discrimination
(OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.42-2.76) (Table 3) after controlling
for age, sex, SES, second-hand tobacco smoke, in utero
tobacco exposure, use of controller medication, and study
site. Moreover, the strength of the association between
poor asthma control and perceived discrimination
increased with exposure to discrimination (P for trend,
.006). These associations were not observed for Latino
subgroups regardless of how discrimination was specified.
No heterogeneity was noted in the association between
asthma control and perceived discrimination according to
SES and global African ancestry for any racial/ethnic
group (P for interactions $ .22) (e-Tables 5, 6).
Interestingly, perceived discrimination was associated
with poor asthma control among African American
children regardless of the proportion of their global
African ancestry and among only those Mexican
American children with a low African ancestry proportion
(e-Table 6).
Discussion
We observed increased odds of asthma and poor asthma
control with perceived racial/ethnic discrimination among
African American youth. Additionally, the odds of asthma

 and poor control increase as the severity of perceived
discrimination increased. For Mexican Americans and
other Latinos, the association between perceived
discrimination and asthma varied with SES, with increased
odds observed for low-SES Mexican American children
and other Latino children with high SES.
These findings contribute to the existing evidence
implicating racial/ethnic discrimination as a predictor of
negative health outcomes in children.10,11,14,15 For
asthma specifically, the findings are consistent with
results correlating discriminatory experiences and
subsequent asthma diagnosis in African-American adult
women.19 To our knowledge, this study is the first to
show an association between discrimination and an
asthma diagnosis in African American and Latino
children. We concur with findings that perceived
discrimination is an important risk factor for poor
asthma control among minority children41,42 and
emphasize the importance of considering psychosocial
stress when assessing childhood asthma.1,18,42
Differential access to services and opportunities in
society, resulting in reduced access to health-care
services and medications, has been shown to affect
asthma outcomes in minority populations.22-25,33 In
addition, our findings suggest that perceived racial/
ethnic discrimination is an independent risk factor for
asthma in African Americans. Additionally, as
evidenced by the Mexican American and other Latino
participants, experiences of discrimination may work
together with social status.43 Thus, perceived
discrimination and SES, independently or jointly, may
be relevant factors to consider for the health of minority
children.
The relationship between SES and racial/ethnic
discrimination is complex. In some cases, SES may lead to
underreporting of discriminatory experiences among
those with limited resources or better identification of
racist attacks among those with fewer competing
economic stressors.44 Additionally, historical experiences
of discrimination in a particular racial/ethnic group may
make such events more recognizable, regardless of SES.
These varying accounts likely explain the different
associations we observed between SES and discrimination
among the population of African American and Latino
participants. Additionally, unmeasured factors, related to
both SES and discriminatory experiences, may account
for some of the association seen with asthma and
related outcomes. Communities that are affected by
interpersonal discrimination to the greatest degree
are also more likely to fall victim to incidences of
structural racism, including living in areas exposed
to higher levels of air pollution and substandard
housing, as well as exposure to community violence.1,7
The latter are factors that are also increased among those
from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds and
have been independently shown to increase the risk of
asthma and related outcomes.45
Although this study advances our understanding of race/
ethnicity and health outcomes, there are important
limitations that should be noted. Although we present
evidence of a dose-response association between
perceived discrimination and asthma in the African
American participants, which provides strength to the
observations presented, the use of a cross-sectional
design limits our ability to make causal inference or
establish a temporal relationship between asthma and
perceived discrimination.
Although the Experiences of Discrimination
questionnaire has been validated in US adult
populations,34 we limited the questionnaire to items
relevant to pediatric populations (school and medical
settings, while receiving services, and in public). Despite
this limitation, the questions we included overlap with
those previously used in instruments validated for

 children.14,15,46 Unlike instruments specific for pediatric
populations,35 we are missing items assessing
experiences unique to pediatric populations, and as a
result our instrument likely underestimates the true
prevalence of discrimination and the magnitude of the
association of interest in our study population.
Moreover, by limiting our assessment to racial/ethnic
discrimination, we may have missed important
experiences of discrimination associated with sex,
religion, language, and sexual orientation.47 In addition,
our participants’ distress may result from discriminatory
events directed at other family members, including
caregivers and siblings, which were not assessed. Finally,
we excluded 2,019 participants due to missing data,
mostly for discrimination and SES indicators. However,
participants were selected based on disease status and
not on perceived discrimination or SES (or both), and
thus, it is unlikely that these exclusions biased our
results.
The strength of this study lies in the availability of
multiple variables and a large diverse sample size. Our
design included more than 3,500 African American and
Latino children from across the United States and
Puerto Rico and supports the conclusion that
discrimination operates independent of factors known
to contribute to either asthma or discrimination itself. In
addition, such a sample size allows the opportunity to
examine heterogeneity within the study sample.
Future studies should aim to advance the quantification
of discriminatory experience in pediatric populations
and further establish the association of these experiences
with physical health outcomes such as asthma. There is
also a need for a clearer understanding of the
mechanisms by which stress affects asthma, a condition
particularly sensitive to psychosocial stress. Assessment
of discrimination, as well as its forms (eg, sex, religion,
language, sexual orientation, and physical ability) could
help our understanding of the effect of perceived
discrimination not only for a common disease such as
asthma but also for other stress-related pediatric
diseases.47
Conclusions
Consistent with prior studies in both adults13,19 and
children,11,15 our findings suggest that racial/ethnic
discrimination independently contributes to poor health
outcomes. Thus, as experiences of discrimination
contribute to asthma outcomes, one of the most
common childhood conditions, these experiences may
also contribute to health inequity in general among US
children and adolescents throughout the life course.
