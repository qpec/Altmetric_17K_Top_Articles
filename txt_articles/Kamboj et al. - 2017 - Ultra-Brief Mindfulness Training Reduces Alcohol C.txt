Abstract
Background: Like other complex psychosocial interventions, mindfulness-based treatments comprise various modality-
specific components as well as nonspecific therapeutic ingredients that collectively contribute to efficacy. Consequently, the 
isolated effects of mindfulness strategies per se remain unclear.
Methods: Using a randomized double-blind design, we compared the isolated effects of 11-minutes of “supervised” 
mindfulness instruction against a closely matched active control (relaxation) on subjective, physiological, and behavioral 
indices of maladaptive alcohol responding in drinkers at risk of harm from alcohol use (n = 68). Simple follow-up instructions 
on strategy use were provided, but practice was unsupervised and not formally monitored.
Results: Both groups showed acute reductions in craving after training, although a trend group x time interaction (P = .056) 
suggested that this reduction was greater in the relaxation group (d = 0.722 P < .001) compared with the mindfulness group (d 
= 0.317, P = .004). Furthermore, upregulation of parasympathetic activity was found after relaxation (d = 0.562; P < .001) but not 
mindfulness instructions (d = 0.08; P > .1; group x time interaction: P = .009). By contrast, only the mindfulness group showed 
a reduction in past-week alcohol consumption at 7-day follow-up (-9.31 units, d = 0.593, P < .001), whereas no significant 
reduction was seen in the relaxation group (-3.00 units, d = 0.268, P > .1; group x time interaction: P = .026).
Conclusion: Very brief mindfulness practice can significantly reduce alcohol consumption among at-risk drinkers, even with 
minimal encouragement to use this strategy outside of the experimental context. The effects on consumption may therefore 
represent a lower bound of efficacy of “ultra-brief” mindfulness instructions in hazardous drinkers, at least at short follow-up 
intervals.

Introduction
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) causes inestimable personal suffer-
ing and contributes significantly to the global disease burden 
(Whiteford et al., 2013). However, AUD represents a clinical end-
point that is influenced by numerous environmental, develop-
mental, and neurobiological factors (e.g., Schuckit, 1994; Slutske, 
2005; Walsh et al., 2017). The transition to more severe alcohol 
problems is generally preceded by patterns of heavy drinking, 
which might not cross the severity threshold for AUD but are 
nonetheless associated with elevated risk of various negative 
outcomes for the individual, their social networks, and soci-
ety more broadly (NICE, 2010). From a public health perspec-
tive therefore, these at-risk drinkers are an important group for 
whom innovative brief psychosocial interventions are needed 
(Whitlock et al., 2004; NICE, 2010).
In recent years, many innovations in behavioral science have 
occurred at the interface between Eastern and Western scientific 
psychology in the form of “mind-body” treatments (Grossman 
et al., 2004). There has been particular interest in mindfulness-
based interventions for a range of psychiatric and physical 
health conditions (Gotink et al., 2015), which has been mirrored 
by enormous public interest in these approaches (Shonin and 
Van Gordon, 2015). Marlatt and colleagues (e.g., Leigh et al., 2005; 
Marlatt and Marques, 1977) were among the first to advance 
the idea that techniques based on Eastern contemplative tra-
ditions could usefully be incorporated into formal psychologi-
cal treatments for addiction. Since the publication of this early 
theoretical and clinical case material, more than 30 randomized 
controlled trials of mindfulness-based interventions in sub-
stance-using populations have been published (reviewed in Li 
et al., 2017). These studies suggest that, compared with alterna-
tive treatments, mindfulness-based treatments are superior on 
a variety of substance-use related outcomes.
Mindfulness refers to a heightened moment-to-moment 
awareness of the processes and contents of the mind, without 
judgement or clinging (Mikulas, 2011). As such, this process is 
antithetical to the fixation upon and elaboration of desire states 
that characterize addictions (May et al., 2004). Craving is the 
quintessential desire state associated with problematic drug use 
and is activated by external cues (cue-induced craving), as well 
as operating as a background state (tonic craving) signalling var-
ying degrees of deprivation (Sayette, 2016). Given the proposed 
association between craving (and negative affect) and relapse 
(Sinha and Li, 2007), most existing psychosocial (e.g., cogni-
tive behavioral therapy) and pharmacological treatments (e.g., 
replacement therapies) for drug and alcohol problems directly 
aim to downregulate the intensity of cue-induced or tonic crav-
ing, or both. Many psychosocial treatments for alcohol and 
substance use problems, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, 
consist of “emotion regulation” procedures that explicitly aim 
to reduce the occurrence and/or intensity of craving. Theoretically, 
these procedures derive from the idea that maladaptive behav-
iors are proceeded by undesirable cognitive and affective states 
(e.g., craving and drug-related thoughts), and reductions in the 
intensity/occurrence of these states is responsible for behavior 
change (Beck et al., 2001). Relaxation is a prototypical emotion 
regulation strategy, which is commonly employed in psychoso-
cial AUD treatments to reduce physiological arousal associated 
with craving, negative affect, or stress (Spada, 2012).
Notably, mindfulness-based approaches do not aim to dis-
pel or otherwise alter craving or related thoughts and feelings. 
Instead, these approaches emphasise nonjudgementally attend-
ing to the arising of craving, its intensification, and gradual dimi-
nution, followed by further arising (e.g., “urge surfing,” Bowen 
and Marlatt, 2009). By deliberating on these subjective experi-
ences nonjudgementally, the individual learns about their usual 
tendency to respond reflexively to urges. They also learn that 
they can apply nonreactive observation to urges that normally 
activate automatized action tendencies (compulsions). As such, 
one proposal is that mindfulness-based treatments enable the 
link between craving, affect, and behavior to become increas-
ingly conscious and under the control of intention (Brewer 
et al., 2013), leading to an uncoupling between drug-taking and 
automatic motivational tendencies (Ostafin et al., 2012; see also 
Garland et al., 2014) and craving (Brewer et al., 2011; Elwafi et al., 
2013). Other clinical trials suggest that, despite not directly aim-
ing to reduce craving, reductions in craving are nonetheless 
observed following mindfulness-based treatments (e.g., Bowen 
et al., 2009; Davis et al., 2014; Garland et al., 2016; see Li et al., 2017 
for other examples). Laboratory experiments have also shown 
acute reductions in craving following mindfulness in smokers, 
although this effect is most robust when mindfulness strate-
gies are compared with inactive control strategies (see Serfaty 
et al., 2017). Alternatively, some laboratory studies have shown 
that, relative to active control strategies (e.g., distraction or reap-
praisal), brief mindfulness-like strategies result in increased 
(Szasz et al., 2012), or limited reductions in, cue-induced craving 
(Murphy and McKillop, 2014). As such, the mechanistic relation-
ship between mindfulness treatment, craving, and drug use is 
complex and remains to be resolved (although see Witkiewitz 
and Bowen, 2010 for a well-powered moderated-mediation anal-
ysis involving mindfulness-based relapse prevention vs treat-
ment as usual and craving, depression, and substance use).
While an evidence base that supports the use of mindful-
ness-based therapies for AUD (e.g., mindfulness-based relapse 
prevention, acceptance and commitment therapy, dialectical 
behavior therapy) is developing apace (Grant et al., 2015; Lee et 
al., 2015; Li et al., 2017; Rösner et al., 2015), few well-controlled 
laboratory studies have been performed that parse the specific, 
isolated effects of specific mindfulness strategies (Levin et al., 
2012). Such studies have different aims to those of clinical tri-
als of mindfulness therapies, which involve complex treatment 
packages, containing numerous individual therapeutic proce-
dures (Craig et al., 2008). It is therefore difficult to isolate the 
contribution of individual therapeutic elements and determine 
their impact on overall efficacy using RCT designs (Levin et al., 
2012). Although recent developments in clinical trial design 
allow common addiction treatment elements to be studied in 
relative isolation and in simple combinations (Schlam et al., 
2016), RCTs are expensive and cumbersome. An alternative 
approach has therefore been to study specific, isolated psy-
chosocial treatment elements in highly controlled laboratory 
Significance Statement
We examine the isolated effects of simple mindfulness instructions in people at risk of harm from alcohol consumption (“at-risk 
drinkers”). A single brief session of mindfulness resulted in significant reductions in alcohol consumption compared with a care-
fully matched relaxation control condition at 1-week follow-up. These findings suggest that even “ultra-brief” experience with 
mindfulness can have measurable and potentially clinically meaningful effects in at-risk drinkers.

settings. The aims of such studies are closely aligned to those of 
pharmacological dose-finding studies (e.g., McCabe et al., 2009), 
namely to achieve maximum levels of experimental control to 
establish a proof-of-concept prior to RCTs designed to establish 
clinical utility. Moreover, such laboratory experimental studies 
allow a flexible, fine-grained, and highly efficient assessment 
of specific therapeutic strategies on mechanistically important 
substance-use indicators, which might be logistically difficult to 
assess in clinical trials (e.g., cue-induced craving) or raise ethical 
issues in treatment seekers (e.g., use of an alcohol “taste test”).
T
wo laboratory studies testing the specific and isolated effects 
of brief mindfulness strategies in at-risk drinkers have been pub-
lished recently. These showed either a highly circumscribed and 
limited differential effect of mindfulness (i.e., changes in state 
mindfulness immediately following mindfulness relative to a 
word-count matched relaxation condition; Vinci et al., 2014) or 
superior efficacy of a control strategy (distraction) on craving 
and craving-related distress relative to mindfulness (Murphy 
and MacKillop, 2014). However, while these and other laboratory 
experimental studies are informative, they have some limitations. 
These include lack of experimenter blinding, limited matching of 
conditions or nonoptimal controls, limited use of theoretically 
appropriate outcomes, and use of research participants whose 
alcohol/drug-use patterns are unlikely to be habitual (see Serfaty 
et al., 2017). As such, it remains to be established whether brief 
mindfulness instructions can have effects that endure beyond a 
laboratory training session and affect consumption behavior in 
drug-/alcohol-using populations, including at-risk drinkers.
Efficacy alone is not sufficient to establish the clinical util-
ity of psychosocial interventions for AUD. Such treatments also 
need to have high levels of compliance, uptake, and cost effec-
tiveness. These factors likely explain the preference among ser-
vice providers and users for brief alcohol interventions (Bertholet 
et al., 2005). However, it is generally accepted that mindfulness 
is a form of cognitive training requiring sustained and disci-
plined practice, and as such, the conjunction of the terms “brief” 
and “mindfulness” may seem oxymoronic. However, Bowen and 
Marlatt (2009) reported promising effects of just 11 minutes of 
mindfulness instructions on smoking behavior over the course 
of a 7-day follow-up. Given those findings, and the limitations 
in previous experimental research on mindfulness in drug- and 
alcohol-using populations (noted above), it remains important 
to determine whether a minimal dose of mindfulness is effec-
tive in changing drinking outcomes in the short term (≤7 days). 
Evidence of post-acute benefits of brief mindfulness strategies 
might have clinical importance, encouraging the use of such 
strategies early in treatment, with the potential to improve self-
efficacy and treatment motivation and retention.
In the current study, we aimed to address the limitations of 
previous laboratory studies of mindfulness in drug and alco-
hol users by comparing the effects of a brief set of mindfulness 
instructions with well-matched, active control instructions in 
participants with elevated risk of alcohol-related harms. The 
control strategy in this case consisted of relaxation instruc-
tions specifically designed to downregulate craving by reduc-
ing arousal. The mindfulness instructions, on the other hand, 
emphasized ongoing attention to internal experiences without 
attempting to change these. We describe these strategy instruc-
tions as ultra-brief because of their brevity relative to instruc-
tions typically used in mindfulness-based treatments (typically 
>10 hours; e.g., Bowen et al., 2014).
Methods
University College London Ethics Committee provided ethi-
cal approval for this study. A double-blind, randomized 
controlled design was used to assess the effects of mindful-
ness and relaxation on cue reactivity and drinking behavior. 
Following telephone screening, participants attended the study 
center (day 1), followed by remote 1-week follow-up (on day 8; 
Figure 1). Participants were blind to group and study hypotheses. 
Experimenters were blind to treatment allocation (see below).
Participants
Participants (n = 68; n = 34 women) were heavy drinkers but oth-
erwise healthy. They provided written, informed consent and 
met the following inclusion criteria: fluency in English; age 18 
to 50 years; preference for beer; hazardous drinking indicated 
by a score of ≥8 on the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification 
Test (AUDIT; Babor et al., 2001), and pre-2016 thresholds for 
risky drinking in the UK (≥14 or ≥21 units/week for men and 
women respectively; 8 g ethanol/unit). Participants who self-
declared the presence of current mental health problems or 
substance/alcohol use disorder or historical treatment seek-
ing for these conditions were excluded. Note, the AUDIT was 
only used to screen-in rather than screen-out participants 
with high scores.

Those self-declaring any respiratory difficulties were also 
excluded (see below). Of n 
= 
241 screened individuals, n 
= 
92 
were eligible, and n 
= 
68 attended the scheduled experimental 
session. The majority were students (n 
= 
54; 79.5%) with similar 
numbers of students per group (χ2(1) 
= 
1.439, P 
> 
.1). Participants 
received £20 compensation.
Based on an effect size from similar work (ηp
2 
= 
0.13; Beadman 
et al., 2015; G*Power3, Faul et al., 2007), a minimum n 
≥ 
22 was 
sufficient to detect a significant (α 
= 
0.05) time x group interac-
tion. However, given the uncertainty about effect magnitude for 
some indices used here, a conservative small-medium sized 
effect (f 
= 
0.175) was assumed, yielding a sample size estimate of 
n 
= 
68 (α 
= 
0.05; 1-β 
= 
0.80).
Measures
Physiological Indices of Cue-Reactivity and Strategy Response
Psychophysiological indices are markers of treatment response, 
indexing changes in cue-reactivity (Kamboj et al., 2011, 2012). 
Here, systolic blood pressure (BP; BM40 XL, Beurer UK Limited) 
was used as an index of cue-associated physiological arousal 
and sampled immediately after the cue-reactivity procedures for 
neutral and alcohol cues (see below; Sinha et al., 2009). Diastolic 
BP values are also reported. Heart rate variability (HRV) was 
used as a marker of autonomic functioning before and during 
strategy-use and was acquired using an electrocardiogram (ECG) 
device with a sampling rate of 1 kHz (Bodyguard 2, Firstbeat 
Technologies). HRV was quantified using the mean square of 
successive inter-beat differences (RMSSD), which reflects self-
regulation capacity and underlying parasympathetic influ-
ence on cardiac activity. RMSSD is particularly appropriate for 
short duration measurements, as used here (Task Force of The 
European Society of Cardiology, 1996).
ECG electrodes were attached below the right collarbone and 
left ribcage at the start of the experiment to allow stabilization. 
Event markers corresponded to the start and end of a 5-min-
ute baseline period prior to cue exposure, and the last 5-minute 
period of mindfulness/relaxation. Data were analyzed offline 
(Kubios; Tarvainen et al., 2014).
Alcohol-Related Measures
The AUDIT (Babor et al., 2001) assessed hazardous/harmful 
drinking. Previous week consumption was assessed using a 
7-day Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB; Sobell and Sobell, 1992), and 
UK government guidelines were used to determine binge-drink-
ing frequency (≥6 or ≥8 units of alcohol ≥once/week for women 
and men, respectively). The Drinking Motives Questionnaire-
Revised (DMQR) was used to assess high-risk drinking motives 
(coping and self-enhancement; Cooper, 1994).
Episodic craving was assessed using the 12-item Alcohol 
Craving Questionnaire (ACQ; Singleton et al., 1994) either in 
the context of the cue reactivity procedure (i.e., phasic or cue-
induced craving) or in the absence of cues (i.e., tonic or back-
ground craving; see Tiffany and Wray, 2012, for discussion of the 
distinction of these 2 types of craving). In both cases, instruc-
tions were to rate the items according to how participants 
felt “right now.” Mean values for the 12 items of the ACQ are 
reported here.
Affect
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; Zigmond 
and Snaith, 1983) identifies abnormal levels of anxiety and 
depression, with 7 items related to each construct. The State-
Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; Spielberger, 2010) was also used 
to assess trait anxiety. Affective state (valence and arousal) was 
assessed using the affect grid (Russel et al., 1989), a 2-dimen-
sional, 9 x 9 matrix, with valence anchors of “extremely 
unpleasant” (score 
= 
1; left side of grid) and “extremely pleasant” 
(score 
= 
9; right side of grid) and arousal anchors of “extremely 
highly aroused” (score 
= 
9; top of grid) and “extreme sleepi-
ness” (score 
= 
 1; bottom of grid). A single cross is placed in one 
of the 81 boxes to simultaneously indicate current valence and 
arousal. The middle square (score of 5) corresponded to neutral 
valence and arousal. Arousal and valence were assessed over 2 
timescales: acutely in the context of the cue reactivity proce-
dure (cue-induced arousal/valence, day 1) and longer term (day 
1 baseline to day 8 follow-up) reflecting background affect (i.e., 
in the absence of cues).
Mindfulness and Relaxation
Trait mindfulness was assessed using the Five Facet Mindfulness 
Questionnaire (Baer et al., 2008). Immediately after the mind-
fulness or relaxation strategy, state mindfulness was assessed 
with the Toronto Mindfulness Scale (TMS) and state relaxation-
tension using a 9-point single-item measure (“absolutely no ten-
sion” to “extremely tense;” Vinci et al., 2014).
Manipulation Checks
The Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire was adapted from 
the original measure (Devilly and Borkovec, 2000) and referred 
to beliefs about whether the allocated strategy might help the 
participant reduce their drinking. A manipulation check (Rood 
et al., 2012; Murphy and MacKillop, 2014) was adapted for this 
study and included 6 true/false questions (e.g., “I was instructed 
to allow my craving to stay as it is without trying to change 
it;” “I was instructed to breathe calmly in order to reduce my 
craving”). Strategy use during the 7-day follow-up period was 
assessed remotely on day 8 (“how many days have you practiced 
the technique during this week?” and “for how long (minutes) on 
average have you practiced each day”). Finally, participants were 
asked about the extent to which they were “fully engaged” with 
the strategy during the previous week (5-point scale: 1 
= 
 “not at 
all,” 3 
= 
”somewhat;” 5 
= 
 “completely”).
In Vivo Cue-Reactivity Procedure
Reactivity was assayed for identical quantities of chilled water 
(“neutral”) and chilled beer (“alcohol”) in identical beer glasses. 
Water preceded alcohol cues to avoid carry-over effects 
(Sayette et al., 2010). The reactivity procedure was conducted 
at 2 time points: before (cue reactivity 1) and after (cue reac-
tivity 2) strategy use (see Figure 1 for timeline of measures). 
The instructions on interacting with cues were the same for 
all participants and were delivered as a standardized audio (~2 
minutes) via headphones. Participants were asked to notice 
sensory qualities and any thoughts that occurred while inter-
acting with cues. Participants were then instructed to imagine 
taking a sip of the drink, noticing accompanying sensations 
and urges. BP, craving (ACQ-now), and affect (affect grid) were 
assessed after exposure to each type of cue before and after 
strategy use.
Beer Taste-Test
Participants were instructed to drink as much/as little of 275 mL 
chilled beer (Becks Blue, alcohol-free) as required to provide 
accurate taste ratings (below; Field and Eastwood, 2005). Alcohol-
free beer was used to avoid pharmacological interference with 
mindfulness/relaxation. Although we concealed our intention 
(to avoid pharmacological effects of alcohol), this “deception” 
was necessary to preserve the integrity of the experimental 
manipulations.

Participants rated the beer on 4 sensory continua to conceal 
the objective of this test (Field and Eastwood, 2005). This task 
along with the breath holding task (see below) were under-
taken prior to (behavior 1) and after (behavior 2) mindfulness or 
relaxation strategies (see Figure 1 for timing of behavior 1 and 
2 measures).
Breath-Holding
The duration of breath-holding is a behavioural measure of dis-
tress tolerance, which may be related to (the effects of) mindful-
ness (Lotan et al., 2013). Participants held their breath for as long 
as possible after a full, normal exhalation (Sütterlin et al., 2013). 
To ensure compliance, participants wore a nose clip and were 
monitored. Timing (seconds) stopped when participants took 
their first inhalation.
Mindfulness and Relaxation Strategies
Strategy instructions were recorded in a sound-attenuated envi-
ronment (same male actor for both sets of instructions). Doctoral 
trainees in clinical psychology (n 
= 
10) with academic and clini-
cal training in mindfulness rated both recordings (10-point 
scale) on the extent to which the instructions were consistent 
with their respective aims (to encourage either mindfulness 
or relaxation in response to craving). Both strategies scored 
highly: mindfulness 
= 
9.60 
± 
0.70; relaxation 
= 
8.90 
± 
0.74. Strategy 
instructions were well matched in terms of duration, number of 
words (mindfulness: 1581; relaxation:1595 words for 4 phases; 
see below), number of smoking- and craving-related words, and 
language complexity (Flesch-Kincaid grade level 8).
Participants received strategy instructions according to a ran-
domization code, balanced for gender (www.random.org), which 
was concealed from the experimenters. The audio instructions 
were stored on separate USB devices retained by the study super-
visors and accessed individually for each participant, along with 
a sealed envelope, containing experimenter-concealed follow-
up practice instructions printed on a credit-card sized flashcard.
During the session, participants were administered instruc-
tions from one of the USB devices according to randomization 
code. Headphone audio volume was fixed to prevent sound 
leakage and inadvertent breaking of the experimenter blind.
Instructions involved 4 phases: introduction (30 seconds), expla-
nation of strategy (3 minutes), preliminary experiential practice 
(4 minutes), and main strategy practice (7 minutes). The intro-
duction explained the aim of the upcoming strategy and was 
identical for both strategies. During the explanation of strategy, 
the relaxation group was told, for example, that craving inten-
sity can be reduced by “softening the muscles...and calming 
and unwinding the mind…releasing tension in your body” and 
that relaxation enabled transformation of sensations into more 
calming, less unpleasant experiences. It was also emphasized 
that this was a way of gaining control over craving.
By contrast, mindfulness instructions did not include any 
mention of reduced craving or of controlling, transforming, or 
regulating internal experience. It was clarified that the aim was 
not to simply relax, but to be alert and attentive. The empha-
sis was on “open monitoring” of experience and particularly on 
“aware[ness] of feelings and bodily sensations” and to “expe-
rience craving in a different way.” Participants were told that 
by noticing bodily sensations they could “experience them as 
temporary events in the body,” helping the participant to “tol-
erate [bodily sensations] without acting on them.” To minimize 
expectancy effects relating to the increasing popularity and 
public discussion of complementary medicine approaches, no 
mention of the term “mindfulness” (or “relaxation”) was made 
in any experimental or recruitment material.
After the explanations, participants provided ratings of cred-
ibility and expectancy for their assigned strategy. They then 
briefly practiced their assigned strategy (preliminary experi-
ential practice) and then undertook the strategy proper (main 
strategy practice). In contrast to the explanation, which involved 
a simple description of the strategies, the preliminary and main 
strategy practice involved active participation in the strategy. As 
such, during preliminary practice, participants in the mindful-
ness group were first instructed on breath and body awareness. 
They were then instructed to notice alcohol-related urges; to 
focus their attention on these feelings in the body and to “tell 
yourself [for example], I feel my craving in my abdomen [or chest 
etc.].” In contrast, relaxation involved instructions to “calm your 
body” in response to urges; to “loosen and ‘untense’ that region” 
and to “tell yourself, ‘I am managing my craving by calming my 
abdomen [or chest, etc.]’.” Mindfulness participants were also 
instructed to notice “the exact sensations” in their body and 
encouraged to consider the accompanying sensory qualities. 
Relaxation participants were instructed to breathe slowly and 
deeply and to “release tension” upon exhaling.
The main mindfulness practice reiterated and expanded 
upon these instructions, with additional instructions to be 
“open hearted and non-reactive as you notice the [craving] sen-
sations...[letting] go of the tendency to want things to be differ-
ent.” Instructions to “notice” and “focus” on urges “as they come 
and go” and that “these feelings can be accepted and tolerated 
rather than acted upon” were also included and repeated. The 
main relaxation instructions emphasized ease and comfort and 
“releas[ing] any stiffness in your muscles” in response to craving 
sensations. They also included instructions to loosen muscles 
and to respond to any unwanted feelings with feelings of calm-
ness. Full instruction scripts are available from the authors.
At the end of day 1, participants were asked to practice their 
assigned strategy for 15 min/d over the next 7 days, referring 
to the flashcard reminder instructions they received in a sealed 
envelope. These stated, “Remember that if/when you experience 
craving or urge to drink alcohol, you can refrain from it by using 
the strategies you have been taught.” The mindfulness reminder 
card additionally contained instructions to “Notice and observe 
your thoughts and physiological reactions nonjudgementally as 
they arise. Allow them to be there and let them go.” In contrast, 
the relaxation card stated “Take a few deep breaths and release 
any tension in your body as it arises. Allow your muscles to feel 
more and more calm.”

Participants responded to online adverts on general and 
research-oriented sites (Gumtree, Experimatch, Call for par-
ticipants, and a university-administered recruitment system), 
which contained a link to a web-based screening questionnaire 
that participants completed to declare whether they met inclu-
sion/exclusion criteria.
To reduce expectancy effects related to one or the other 
strategy prior to day 1, participants remained blind to the spe-
cific study aims and design. On the day 1, generic information 
relevant to both strategies was provided. Specifically, study 
information described the experiment as involving brief strat-
egies that may be helpful for managing craving experiences. 
Given that only broad aims of the experiment were disclosed, 
a degree of concealment was involved, which, on balance, was 
deemed essential to protect study integrity.

The sequence of tasks on day 1 and 8 is outlined in Figure 
1. Upon arrival, physiological equipment (BP cuff and ECG 
electrodes and device) was attached, followed by a ~10-min-
ute habituation and stabilization period. Participants were 
breathalyzed (Lion 500, Lion Instruments) to ensure compli-
ance with instructions to refrain from alcohol on the test-
ing day (all participants provided readings of 0.00) and then 
completed baseline questionnaires (TLFB, DMQR, HADS, Five 
Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, STAI, background ACQ-
Now, and background affect grid), with baseline HRV data 
acquired simultaneously. This was followed by the in vivo cue 
reactivity procedure for water, and then beer cues, followed 
by the beer taste-test and breath-holding (prestrategy phase; 
Figure 1).
Participants then listened to strategy instructions, imme-
diately followed by completion of poststrategy manipulation 
checks (TMS, relaxation state questionnaire, true/false manip-
ulation check) followed by a second in vivo cue reactivity pro-
cedure with water and beer cues and a second beer taste- and 
breath-holding test (poststrategy phase; Figure 1). At the end of 
the session participants were given the sealed envelope con-
taining follow-up strategy instructions.
Participants completed follow-up assessments on day 8 by 
following a link to an online survey tool. Participants repeated 
the TLFB (previous 7 days), the ACQ-Now, and affect grid. These 
latter assessments (and those at baseline on day 1) were not 
conducted in the context of any cue reactivity instructions and 
hence can be assumed to reflect background-craving and affect. 
Finally, on day 8, participants completed questions regarding 
strategy-use over the previous 7 days.
Statistical Analysis
All data are presented as means ± SD (or SEM, where indicated in 
figures), percentages, or counts. Data were examined for skew-
ness and outliers both statistically (Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests) 
and graphically. Where skewness was not corrected by trans-
formation (questions regarding 7-day strategy practice), non-
parametric (Mann-Whitney) tests were used. Outliers (>upper 
quartile + 1.5*IQR; Field, 2013) were winsorized (replacement 
with the highest nonoutlier for affect grid values or 1+ high-
est nonoutlier for all other variables). Sensitivity analysis con-
firmed the same statistical pattern of findings without outlier 
replacement.
The groups were compared on demographic characteristics, 
trait measures, baseline drinking behavior, and subjectively 
rated dependent variables, using independent samples t tests. 
Other data were analyzed using mixed time x cue type x group 
ANOVAs. The time factor involved 2 timeframes depending on 
the dependent variable: within session and longer term (base-
line to follow-up).
Pearson’s r is reported for correlations. Diagnostics of multi-
ple regression (exploring the effects of group, strategy practice, 
expectancy, and credibility on drinking) revealed no violation of 
the assumptions, indicating ordinary least squares was appro-
priate for parameter estimation.
The significance level was 0.05 and all reported tests were 
2-tailed; all posthoc tests were Bonferroni corrected. Within-
group effect sizes were calculated based on t and r values of 
within-subjects tests (Dunlap et al., 1996). Missing data points 
(recording failures due to technical issues) were missing com-
pletely at random (Little’s test: χ2(776) = 210.23, P > 0.1) and are 
indicated by deviations in the expected degrees of freedom in 
some of the analyses described below.
Results
Sample Characteristics
There were no group differences on demographic, mood, or 
alcohol consumption variables (Table 1; t values ≤1.50; P values > 
.1; ethnicity: χ2(1) = 2.138, P > .1). Frequency of alcohol consump-
tion (AUDIT item 1) was matched (n = 20: 2–3 times/wk; n = 14 ≥4 
times/wk in past month in both groups), as was binge drink-
ing frequency. HADS scores for the whole sample were similar 
to normative UK values for depression (normative mean for 
depression: 3.68 + 3.07; see Crawford et al., 2001) but somewhat 
elevated for anxiety (cf normative mean for anxiety 6.14 + 3.76). 
Nonetheless, the relatively low scores on the HADS (Table 1) in 
this sample is consistent with exclusion of participants with 
significant levels of common psychiatric symptoms.
The groups did not differ on DMQR drinking motives 
(F(3,198) = 0.356, P > .1), and both groups showed the same rank 
order of motives on the DMQR: social (3.84 ± 0.77) ≈ enhancement 
(3.50 ± 0.82) >coping (2.61 ± 1.01) >conformity (1.73 ± 0.81). High 
levels of enhancement motives in particular are consistent with 
the intention to recruit at-risk drinkers (Kuntsche et al., 2005).
General Strategy Effects
Relaxation and mindfulness did not differ in credibility or 
expectancy of efficacy, and participants provided equivalent 
ratings on understanding of strategy instructions (P values > 
.1). Poststrategy state mindfulness was not significantly higher 
in the mindfulness group (t(65) = 1.363, P > .1; Table 2), nor did 
state relaxation-tension differ statistically between groups 
(t(65) = 1.351, P > .1; Table 2). However, parasympathetic activ-
ity indexed using HRV during the strategy showed a significant 
main effect of time (F(1, 57) = 14.973, P < .001, η p
2 = 0.208), sub-
sumed by a significant time x group interaction (F(1, 57) = 7.266, 
P < .01, η p
2 = 0.113; Figure 2). This reflected an increase in HRV 
during relaxation (mean(Diff) = 12.24 ± 2.79 ms; d = 0.562; P < .001)

but not during mindfulness (mean(Diff) = 2.19 ± 2.48 ms; d = 0.08; 
P > .1).
There were no group effects or time x group interaction 
 
(P values >.1) on distress tolerance (breath-holding time), 
although participants showed a trend toward longer breath-
holding times after (i.e., at the behavior 2 time point) compared 
with before strategy instructions (behavior 1 time point; F(1,64) 
= 3.911, P = 
.052; Table 2).
At follow-up there were no group differences in the number 
of days of strategy practice, duration of practice per occasion, or 
level of engagement during practice (Table 2; P values >.1).
Acute Strategy Effects on Cue Reactivity
Subjective cue-induced craving (ACQ-Now) showed main effects 
for cue type (water, beer; F(1,62) = 21.94, P < 
.001, η p
2 = 0.261) 
and time (cue reactivity 1, cue reactivity 2; F(1,62) = 38.272, 
 
P < 
.001, η p
2 = 0.382), along with a cue-type x time interaction 
(F(1,62) = 17.214, P < 
.01, η p
2 = 0.217). The latter reflected larger 
decreases in alcohol craving from pre- to poststrategy in 
response to in vivo beer cues (d = 0.574, P < 
.001) relative to in 
vivo water cues (d = 0.357, P < 
.001) in both groups (Figure 3). 
There was also a trend-level time x group interaction (F(1,62) = 
3.805, P = 
.056, η p
2 = 0.058), reflecting steeper reductions in ACQ-
Now scores in the relaxation group (d = 0.722, P < .001) relative to 
the mindfulness group (d = 0.317, P = 
.004).
Affect grid valence (pleasantness) ratings showed no sig-
nificant main effects or 2-way interactions (F values ≤1.926, P 
> 
.1). However, there was a significant 3-way interaction (F(1,57) 
= 4.768, P = 
.033, η p
2 = 0.077), which appeared to reflect a greater 
reduction in cue-induced pleasantness during beer cue reactiv-
ity (cue-reactivity 1 to cue-reactivity 2; d = 0.274) but not dur-
ing water reactivity (d < 0.1) in the relaxation group (Table 2). 
However, the relevant Bonferroni corrected posthoc test was not 
significant (P > 
.1).
Arousal ratings from the affect grid showed a main effect 
of cue type, with higher levels of arousal to alcohol cues rela-
tive to neutral cues (F(1,57) = 13.284, P = .001, ɳp
2 = 0.189). In 
addition, there was a main effect of time (F(1, 57) = 7.513, 
 
P = .008, ɳp
2 = 0.116), reflecting an overall reduction in arousal 
from pre- to poststrategy in both groups (Table 2). However, 
there were no 2- or 3-way interactions (F values ≤ 1.135, P 
> .1). In addition, there were no main effects or interactions 
on systolic (F values ≤2.590, P > .1) or diastolic BP (F values 
≤2.651, P > .1).
Longer Term Effects on Background Craving 
and Affect
ACQ-Now scores reflecting craving in the absence of the struc-
tured cue reactivity procedure (i.e., background-craving) showed 
a reduction from the baseline to follow-up assessment time 
points (F(1,66) = 54.564, P < 
.001, ɳp
2 = 0.453) but no main or inter-
action effects involving group (F ≤ 2.883, P > 
.094). There were 
also no main effects or interactions on the longer term assess-
ments of pleasantness and arousal (F values ≤ 2.476, P > 
.1).
Acute and Longer Term Effects on Alcohol 
Consumption
There was only a main effect of time on within-session drink-
ing during the beer taste-test (F(1, 65) = 4.551, P = .036, ɳp
2 = 
0.065; Table 2) and no effects involving group (F values < 2.44, 
P > .1). There was also a main effect of time (baseline, follow-
up; F(1,66) = 19.699, P < .001, ɳp
2 = 0.230) on the TLFB assess-
ment of previous 7-day drinking. Critically, however, this 
was qualified by a time x group interaction (F(1,66) = 5.175, 
 
P = .026, P = .037, ɳp
2 = 0.073). As can be seen in Figure 4, the inter-
action reflected a larger reduction in previous 7-day alcohol 
consumption from baseline to follow-up in the mindfulness

relative to the relaxation group (-3.00 units or 24 g of alcohol, 
P > .1, d = 0.268). The change in taste test consumption was 
not correlated with alcohol consumption at follow up (TLFB) 
in either group (r values ≤0.22, P > .1).
When group, practice, credibility, and expectancy along 
with their interactions were entered into a multiple regression 
model, group was the only significant predictor of TLFB-change 
scores (β = 6.45, SE = 2.89, P =

Discussion
In this study, we examined the acute and longer term effects of 
ultra-brief mindfulness training on cue reactivity, affect, auto-
nomic activity, and alcohol consumption in at-risk drinkers. 
Participants rated mindfulness and the control relaxation strat-
egies as equivalently credible, had similar expectancies regard-
ing beneficial effects, and practiced each strategy to a similar 
extent across the 7-day follow-up. Bearing this equivalence in

mind, our primary finding was that despite the brevity of strat-
egy instructions, the mindfulness group, but not the relaxation 
group, showed significant reductions in alcohol consumption 
(reductions of 9.31 units or 74.5g vs 3 units or 24 g of pure alcohol, 
respectively). On the other hand, the relaxation group showed 
significantly increased HRV in line with increased parasympa-
thetic (or reduced sympathetic) influence on cardiac activity 
during strategy use (Sakakibara et al., 1994), and a trend-level 
interaction suggested larger generalized reductions in craving 
in the relaxation group. Descriptively, the 3-way interaction on 
affect-valence also appeared to reflect the effect of relaxation 
on alcohol cue-induced pleasantness, although the relevant 
Bonferonni corrected posthoc test was not significant.
The apparently distinct effects of mindfulness and relaxation 
are consistent with the proposal that these techniques have differ-
ent psychological and physiological mechanisms of action (Dunn 
et al., 1999). The more limited effects of mindfulness on evaluative 
aspects of cue reactivity are consistent with instructions to not 
control or evaluate subjective experiences of craving. In contrast, 
other lab-based mindfulness studies (particularly in smokers) 
have demonstrated a larger downregulation of craving following 
brief mindfulness instructions. However, these effects have gen-
erally been observed when mindfulness was compared with an 
inactive control condition (see review by Serfaty et al., 2017).
In addition, the absence of an effect on autonomic functioning 
(assessed via HRV) during mindfulness is consistent with the idea 
that any relaxation response following mindfulness instructions 
might have been offset by accompanying effortful mental activity, 
especially when instructions such as those used here explicitly 
describe the anticipated mindful state as one of alertness rather 
than relaxation (Lumma et al., 2015). By contrast, the ostensible 
increase in parasympathetic activity and relatively large reduc-
tion in cue-elicited craving in the relaxation group is consist-
ent with instructions related to arousal reduction (Hoffman et 
al., 1982), which are in turn consistent with the general treat-
ment goals of therapies that aim to downregulate the intensity 
of affective states (i.e., cognitive/behavioral therapies). Although 
the effect of relaxation on craving was >2-fold larger than mind-
fulness, the posthoc effects should be treated with caution until 
replicated, as they were based on a trend-level interaction (P 
= 
.056). Nonetheless, these effects are broadly in line with recent 
findings in smokers (Beadman et al., 2015) and heavy drinkers 
(Murphy and MacKillop, 2014) showing that use of emotion regu-
lation strategies (reappraisal and distraction respectively), but not 
mindfulness-like strategies, result in immediate reductions in 
craving. In addition, the effects on parasympathetic activity and 
craving vs drinking behavior may reflect differing time courses 
of action of relaxation and mindfulness, respectively. There were 
no between-group differences in acute (taste-test) drinking, and 
taste-test quantities did not correlate with longer-term (TLFB) 
drinking. Therefore, the effects of mindfulness on alcohol con-
sumption may be time dependent, only emerging after a delay. 
Future research should include a reassessment of subjective and 
physiological cue reactivity and acute drinking behavior (taste 
test) measures to determine the longer-term effects of mindful-
ness/relaxation on these important outcomes.
As well as their obvious clinical implications, studies that 
examine changes in drug-use following mindfulness may be espe-
cially informative based on theoretical consideration (Levin et al., 
2012). Of the recent relevant laboratory studies that examine both 
drug/alcohol use behavior and intensity of internal subjective 
states (Bowen and Marlatt, 2009; Rogojanski et al., 2011; Ostafin et 
al., 2012; Murphy and MacKillop, 2014; Ruscio et al., 2016), we are 
aware of only one study that showed a clear reduction in consump-
tion (smoking) following brief mindfulness instructions compared 
with control (Bowen and Marlatt, 2009). However, despite being an 
important early demonstration of positive effects of brief mindful-
ness instructions on drug use, that study has some limitations. For 
example, subjects appeared to be very light smokers and hence 
may not have shown the high level of automaticity in relation 
to smoking behavior which is assumed to be a primary target of 
mindfulness interventions (see below). In addition, expectancy 
and other important potential confounds were not controlled for. 
By applying a number of methodological improvements (use of a 
carefully matched active control, randomized, double-blind allo-
cation, expectancy and credibility assessment), we believe that 
the current study provides strong evidence for a reduction in drug/
alcohol-use behavior following very brief mindfulness training. 
Comparisons between 2 active psychosocial interventions rarely 
yield significant differences (Wampold and Imel, 2015), underscor-
ing the strength of the current findings.
Importantly, the effects were demonstrated in a clinically 
relevant, albeit non-treatment-seeking group of drinkers at risk 
of harm from alcohol. From an experimental perspective in fact, 
the presence of high levels of consumption and/or elevated indi-
ces of dependence may be particularly important when studying 
the effects of mindfulness in the laboratory. Specifically, lighter, 
social, or episodic drinkers/drug-users are likely to have a limited 
reward-learning history, and since mindfulness is proposed to 
act through a weakening of the influence of automatic processes 
on behavior (Ostafin, 2015), it is possible that the neurobiological 
substrate upon which mindfulness would act is absent in lighter 
users. The most appropriate participants to test the effects of 
mindfulness on behavior may therefore be those with drug/
alcohol dependence, with compulsive patterns of use (Bowen et 
al., 2014). However, laboratory studies must balance this issue 
with the need to maintain high levels of internal validity, which 
can be compromised through the recruitment of more severely 
affected drug/alcohol users, especially due to extraneous vari-
ability arising from psychiatric comorbidity.
We recognize that there are a number of limitations of the 
current study. Firstly, since the current study did not investigate a 
dose-response relationship, we cannot claim to have established 
a minimally effective dose of mindfulness, but simply identi-
fied a very short training duration that produces reductions in 
alcohol consumption. Secondly, students were overrepresented 
in our sample, which may limit the generalizability of our find-
ings. Relatedly, the effects may have been affected by chronicity 
of at-risk drinking, but onset/duration of such drinking was not 
assessed. Such assessments, along with a more complete diag-
nostic workup of participants, would have provided a clearer 
indication of the relevance of the findings to clinical populations 
(especially those with AUD). As it stands, our method for screening 
out participants on the basis of self-declared AUD was probably 
inadequate to this goal, and it is likely that our sample contained 
participants with at least mild AUD. On the other hand, we delib-
erately kept the assessment procedure as simple and brief as pos-
sible in this study, because the between-groups differences were 
expected to be subtle, and more extensive assessment of alcohol-
related difficulties (e.g., structured diagnostic assessment) raised 
a concern that differential effects between mindfulness and an 
active comparator would have been obscured (Kypri et al., 2007).
Thirdly, strategy use was not actively promoted in the days 
after the experimental session, and compliance was measured 
relatively crudely. Frequent assessment of strategy use, along 
with salient prompts to use the strategy, may have provided us 
with higher reliability data to examine the relationship between 
strategy practice and reduction in drinking. On the other hand, 
given the lack of prompts, the effects of mindfulness observed 
here may represent a lower bound of those expected in a clinical

situation, where between-session practice is actively promoted. 
This is highly encouraging for the development of brief mindful-
ness interventions in people at risk of AUD. 
It should also be reiterated that our description of a dissocia-
tion between craving and behavioral outcomes in the 2 strategy 
groups was based on a statistical trend for the relevant interac-
tion. Therefore, these findings should be interpreted with cau-
tion until replicated. However, the >2-fold larger effect size (in 
craving reduction) in the relaxation group suggests that this 
may be a clinically relevant finding. Indeed, beneficial effects 
of very brief relaxation training on craving have been noted in 
smokers (Limsanon and Kalayasiri, 2015). Beyond replication of 
the current findings, future research in at-risk drinkers should 
also examine the specific effects of relaxation in its own right.
Changes in drinking behavior were not biochemically veri-
fied here, and future studies may seek to employ remote alcohol 
monitoring (e.g., continuous alcohol monitoring technologies), 
which is ideally suited to short-timeframe assessments and 
participants for whom liver enzyme tests may not serve as 
sensitive or specific indices of problematic drinking. If such 
monitoring were combined with remote assessment of crav-
ing, this would also enable an objective assessment (or verifi-
cation) of recent drinking in relation to craving assessment, 
allowing more sophisticated modelling of the change process. 
Overall, our study did not make any specific attempt (and was 
not designed) to delineate the detailed mechanistic processes 
that may be responsible for mindfulness’s effects on behavior 
change. It could be argued, for example, that our mindfulness 
instructions might have additionally encouraged reappraisal of 
craving sensations and that our observed effects were second-
ary to this form of emotion regulation (Garland et al., 2014).
Finally, while we made efforts to ensure blinding to strat-
egy condition, we did not test the integrity of the blind for par-
ticipants or experimenters. Relatedly, we did not determine 
whether participants had previous experience of mindfulness 
or relaxation, which could have affected their response to these 
strategies and unblinded them to condition allocation upon 
exposure to the instructions. While expectancy effects might 
have been introduced by including questions about medita-
tion experience during the screening/assessment phase of the 
experiment, retrospective assessment of experience (at the end 
of the follow-up) would have allowed us to factor this variable 
into the interpretation of our findings.
To summarize, we found that ultra-brief in-session mindful-
ness instruction plus similarly brief instructions for out-of-ses-
sion practice was associated with a robust decrease in alcohol 
consumption over the course of a week. The alternative, the 
control relaxation strategy, was associated with increased para-
sympathetic activity during strategy use, and, based on a trend-
level interaction, potentially larger acute reductions in craving. 
The findings suggest that participants can be easily and rap-
idly trained in mindfulness, and this may therefore be a useful 
adjunctive strategy in brief interventions for excessive drinking.
