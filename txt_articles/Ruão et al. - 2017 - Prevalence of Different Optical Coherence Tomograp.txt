Abstract
Purpose: To evaluate the prevalence of different optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings in European patients with high
myopia. Methods: Cross-sectional study conducted in the Macula Unit of the University and Polytechnic Hospital La Fe (Valencia,
Spain). A total of 134 myopic eyes of 69 patients (16 males and 53 females) were included. All patients underwent a spectral
domain OCT examination at least once. The presence of tractional and atrophic myopic maculopathy and choroidal neo-
vascularization (CNV) was evaluated through OCT scans. Results: The prevalence of tractional myopic maculopathy was found
in 53.7% of the eyes. Within this group, 9.7% had foveal retinoschisis, 23.9% extrafoveal retinoschisis, 31.3% internal limiting
membrane rigidity, 24.6% epiretinal membrane, and none had vitreomacular traction. The most prevalent OCT finding was
chorioretinal atrophy, present in 79.1% of the eyes. Choroidal neovascularization was present in 61.9% of the eyes. There was a
trend toward higher prevalence of CNV in eyes with patchy atrophy with foveal involvement compared to those without foveal
involvement (81.8% vs 65.5%; P ¼ .103). Conclusion: The prevalence of CNV was quite high, especially in patients with patchy
atrophy with foveal involvement.

Introduction
High myopia (>6 diopter [D]) is related to a progressive and
excessive elongation of the eye.1 In Europe, the estimated pre-
valence of myopia is 30.6% (25 to 90 years old), and 2.7% for
high myopia, with increasing rates in younger participants.2
The prevalence of high myopia is higher in Asian populations,
ranging from 9% to 21%.3
With the advent of the spectral domain optical coherence
tomography (SD-OCT), new macular findings related to high
myopia have been described leading to a better understanding
of the visual function and pathophysiology. Myopic maculo-
pathy could be classified as tractional, atrophic, or neovascular
(Figure 1). Tractional maculopathy includes internal limiting
membrane (ILM) rigidity, foveoschisis, vascular microfolds,
vascular avulsion, epiretinal membrane, vitreomacular traction,
and macular holes.4,5
Atrophic maculopathy may present as tessellated fundus,
diffuse chorioretinal atrophy, patchy chorioretinal atrophy, and
macular atrophy. Tessellated fundus is characterized by the
presence of well-defined choroidal vessels around the fovea
and arcade vessels. In diffuse chorioretinal atrophy, the poster-
ior pole appears yellowish white. Grayish white lesions in the
macular area or around the optic disc are typical of patchy
chorioretinal atrophy, which are caused by a complete loss of
choriocapillaris. Macular atrophy appears as grayish white or
whitish atrophic lesion around a fibrovascular membrane that
expands through time.6
Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is another possible
complication in patients with high myopia. Spectral domain
optical coherence tomography provides a high-resolution
image of the lesion demonstrating the stages and activity of
CNV. It typically appears as a highly reflective tissue between
the retinal pigment epithelium and the neurosensory retina.3,7,8
Different risk factors for CNV have been described—the pres-
ence of lacquer cracks, patchy atrophy, thinning of the chorio-
capillaris and choroid, and the presence of CNV in the fellow
eye.8 In the present study, we evaluated the prevalence of var-
ious SD-OCT macular findings in patients with high myopia.

 Methods
This study was a cross-sectional study of 134 highly myopic
eyes from 69 patients. The Macula Unit of the University and
Polytechnic Hospital La Fe (Valencia) receives patients with
myopia from primary hospitals with visual complaints or OCT
abnormalities. From this group, patients with �6 D myopia or
axial length �26.5 mm were included in the present study.
Patients with history of any vitreoretinal surgery were
excluded.
All patients underwent at least 1 analysis by SD-OCT
Heidelberg Spectralis (Heidelberg Engineering, Inc, Heidelberg,
Germany). Standard Spectralis HRA-OCT scans were acquired
with 9-ART scanning quality, without enhanced depth imaging.
The SD-OCT scans were analyzed to evaluate the presence of
tractional changes (foveal retinoschisis, extrafoveal retinoschisis,
ILM rigidity, epiretinal membrane, and vitreomacular traction),
atrophic findings (patchy atrophy with/without foveal involve-
ment and diffuse chorioretinal atrophy), or neovascular lesions.
A subanalysis of the presence of ILM rigidity and epiret-
inal membrane in patients with foveal and extrafoveal reti-
noschisis was explored. In the same way, a comparison of
CNV prevalence in patients with or without foveal involve-
ment of patchy atrophy was made. The presence of the dif-
ferent OCT findings was also explored in patients with
chorioretinal atrophy or CNV.
The study was in compliance with the tenets of the Declara-
tion of Helsinki, institutional review boards, and Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act requirements of
the local institution.
All data were analyzed between June and July 2015 and
collected in an Excel document (Microsoft Excel 2011 for Mac,
version 13.3.9). The statistical analysis was performed using
IBM SPSS statistics software for Mac (version 21.0.0) using
Pearson w2 test.
Results
A total of 134 eyes of 69 patients (16 male and 53 female) were
included. The mean age was 63.3 + 12.2 years (range, 38-92
years). The prevalence of the different OCT findings is enum-
erated in Table 1. Chorioretinal diffuse atrophy was the most
prevalent feature, affecting 79.1% of the eyes. Only 7 eyes
from the 134 eyes included did not shown any tomographic
finding.
Tractional Findings
The presence of any sign of myopic retinoschisis (foveal or
extrafoveal) was found in 45 (33.6%) eyes. Foveal retinoschisis
was identified in 13 (9.7%) eyes; of those eyes, 10 (76.9%)
demonstrated ILM rigidity and 3 (23.1%) had epiretinal mem-
brane. There were 32 (23.9%) eyes with extrafoveal retinoschi-
sis, in which 24 (75%) had ILM rigidity and 11 (34.4%) had
epiretinal membrane. Vitreomacular traction was not found in
any patient.

 Atrophic Findings
Patchy atrophy was present in 107 eyes (79.9%); 22 (16.4%)
eyes showed foveal involvement and 85 (63.4%) eyes identi-
fied foveal sparring. There was a trend toward more CNV in
eyes with foveal involvement (81.8%) compared to those with-
out foveal involvement (65.5%; P ¼ .103).
Among the group of eyes with chorioretinal atrophy, the
prevalence of other OCT findings was foveal retinoschisis 12
(11.3%), extrafoveal retinoschisis 29 (27.4%), ILM rigidity 40
(37.7%), epiretinal membrane 26 (24.5%), patchy atrophy
without foveal involvement 72 (67.9%), patchy atrophy with
foveal involvement 21 (19.8%), and CNV 71 (67.0%).
Neovascular Maculopathy Findings
The presence of CNV was found in 83 eyes (61.9%). Within
this group, 5 (6%) had foveal retinoschisis, 24 (28.9%) extra-
foveal retinoschisis, 29 (34.9%) ILM rigidity, 18 (21.7%) epir-
etinal membrane, 54 (65.1%) patchy atrophy without foveal
involvement, 18 (21.7%) patchy atrophy with foveal involve-
ment, and 71 (85.5%) chorioretinal atrophy. Males (n ¼ 25;
80.7%) had a higher prevalence of CNV than females (n ¼ 58;
56.3%).
Discussion
Myopic maculopathy is a major cause of visual loss and legal
blindness worldwide, especially prevalent in Asia. There is not
an accepted classification for myopic maculopathy, although
we find several articles in the literature. After the advent of SD-
OCT, there is growing information about this entity,
particularly for neovascular maculopathy. The risk for the
development of myopic CNV in patients with high myopia is
not well characterized.1,3 A recent systematic review from
Wong et al8 described CNV in different populations, as
described below. Studies from the United States 20 and 40
years ago described a CNV prevalence of 5% in pathological
patients with myopia. This value can double in the Asian pop-
ulation. In the same article, 8 studies are mentioned reporting a
female predominance of myopic CNV prevalence, allegedly
due to an estrogen receptor expression in CNV. Our data do
not corroborate this, since males (80.7%) had a higher preva-
lence than females (56.3%). In a different type of study with 3
years of follow-up, 10.2% of myopic eyes developed CNV.1
Our study population showed a high rate of CNV (61.9%),
which is the most vision-threatening complication of high myo-
pia, and puts at risk more than half of our population. This high
prevalence is most likely explained by the type of patient with
high myopia seen in our Macula Unit, since only patients with
any visual symptoms or OCT abnormalities are referred for our
consultation.
In a Japanese study9 with 151 highly myopic eyes evaluated
with a swept source OCT, the incidence of myopic foveoschisis
was 9.3%, a value close to that in our study (9.7%). On the
other hand, the rates of epiretinal membrane (24.6%) in our
study are just above the values in the literature, as the epiretinal
membrane prevalence in highly myopic eyes ranged from
11.2% to 23.2%.10,11 In our study, foveal retinoschisis was
highly associated with ILM rigidity, as 76.9% of patients with
foveal retinoschisis had ILM rigidity.
The absence of vitreomacular traction in our population could
be somehow expected. Based on the results of the study by
Itakura et al,9 87.5% of patients with high myopia aged 60 years
or older had a complete posterior vitreous detachment. The mean
age of our study group was 63.3 years, thus, we can assume that
vitreomacular traction in this age range is quite rare.
Our study shows the prevalence of different SD-OCT macu-
lar findings in patients with high myopia in a Caucasian Euro-
pean population. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
bigger review of the prevalence of myopic maculopathy signs
in Europe. Different studies have been published based on
Asian populations, thus, the data could not be imported in our
daily clinical practice. Further studies with a larger cohort of
patients in different European countries are warranted in order
to better explain myopic maculopathy and the different clinical
findings.
