IMPORTANCE Food subsidies are designed to enhance food availability, but whether they
promote cardiometabolic health is unclear.
OBJECTIVE To investigate whether higher consumption of foods derived from subsidized
food commodities is associated with adverse cardiometabolic risk among US adults.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional analysis of the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey data from 2001 to 2006. Our final analysis was performed in
January 2016. Participants were 10 308 nonpregnant adults 18 to 64 years old in the general
community.
EXPOSURE From a single day of 24-hour dietary recall in the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey, we calculated an individual-level subsidy score that estimated an
individual’
s consumption of subsidized food commodities as a percentage of total caloric
intake.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcomes were body mass index (calculated as
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), abdominal adiposity, C-reactive
protein level, blood pressure, non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, and glycemia.
RESULTS Among 10 308 participants, the mean (SD) age was 40.2 (0.3) years, and a mean
(SD) of 50.5% (0.5%) were male. Overall, 56.2% of calories consumed were from the major
subsidized food commodities. United States adults in the highest quartile of the subsidy score
(compared with the lowest) had increased probabilities of having a body mass index of at
least 30 (prevalence ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.23-1.52), a ratio of waist circumference to height of
at least 0.60 (prevalence ratio, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.25-1.59), a C-reactive protein level of at least
0.32 mg/dL (prevalence ratio, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.19-1.51), an elevated non–high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol level (prevalence ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.05-1.25), and dysglycemia
(prevalence ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.04-1.40). There was no statistically significant association
between the subsidy score and blood pressure.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among US adults, higher consumption of calories from
subsidized food commodities was associated with a greater probability of some
cardiometabolic risks. Better alignment of agricultural and nutritional policies may potentially
improve population health.

A
mong the justifications for the 1973 US Farm Bill was
to assure consumers a plentiful supply of food at rea-
sonable prices.1 Four decades later, the US population
is burdened by substantial obesity and cardiometabolic
disease.2,3 Suboptimal diet quality is a leading factor associ-
ated with death and disability in the United States.4 Specifi-
cally,dietsthatarehighincalories,saturatedfats,salt,andsug-
ars but low in fruits and vegetables have been implicated in
thedevelopmentofcardiometabolicriskfactors(obesityoradi-
posity, elevated blood pressure, elevated lipid levels, and dia-
betes) and diseases.5
The US Department of Agriculture and US Department of
Health and Human Services Dietary Guidelines for Americans
emphasize consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains,
protein, and moderate amounts of dairy, while recommend-
ing limited consumption of saturated fats, sugars, salt, and
refined grains.6 At the same time, current federal agricul-
tural subsidies focus on financing the production of corn,
soybeans, wheat, rice, sorghum, dairy, and livestock, the 2
latter of which are in part via subsidies on feed grains.7 From
1995 to 2010, approximately $170 billion was spent on these
7 commodities and programs.7 A large proportion of these
subsidized commodities are converted into high-fat meat
and dairy products, refined grains, high-calorie juices and
soft drinks (sweetened with corn sweeteners), and processed
and packaged foods.7 For example, 30% to 40% of the corn,
more than half of the soybeans, and almost all of the sor-
ghum grown in the United States are used as feed for US
cattle and livestock, while approximately 5% of the corn is
converted into high-fructose corn syrup, and the other half
of the soybeans are converted into oils.8 Because the US agri-
cultural sector produces approximately 80% of the food that
Americans eat (the other 20% comes from imports), the
foods that are produced domestically matter for the Ameri-
can diet.4
Commentators have noted that because commodity sub-
sidies are federally funded taxpayers pay for the production
of these foods, as well as the potential downstream health ex-
penditures attributable to diet-related cardiometabolic
diseases.4,9 However, empirical evidence that the nation’
s ag-
ricultural policies are misaligned with nutritional recommen-
dations has been limited to ecological assessments.7 To date,
no study has examined the associations between consump-
tion of subsidized foods and cardiometabolic health at the in-
dividual level. Such evidence may more accurately help char-
acterize the alignment of agricultural policies with nutrition
and health. This study aimed to fill that gap using a recently
developed scoring system to estimate an individual’
s con-
sumption of subsidized foods and their derivatives.10
Methods
Institutional review board approval is not required for sec-
ondary analysis using the National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey (NHANES) data. The data collection pro-
cess of the NHANES has its own institutional review board and
written and oral informed consent procedures.
Data Sources and Participant Selection
We used data from 2001 to 2006 from the NHANES, a con-
tinuous, cross-sectional study of the noninstitutionalized,
civilian US population, with data released in 2-year cycles. Our
final analysis was performed in January 2016. Detailed de-
scriptions of the NHANES sampling methods are provided
elsewhere.11 We restricted our sample to 10 308 nonpregnant
adults 18 to 64 years old in the general community who pro-
videdcompletedietarydataasdeterminedbytheNHANESand
had daily caloric intake between 800 and 5000 kcal.12,13
Consumption of Subsidized Foods
Our main exposure of interest was a subsidy score, the pro-
portion of individual-level dietary intake (in calories) derived
from the 7 major subsidized food commodities (corn, soy-
beans, wheat, rice, sorghum, dairy, and livestock). The sub-
sidy score ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 indicates 0% of
total energy from subsidized commodities, and 1.0 indicates
100% of total energy from subsidized commodities. This sub-
sidy score variable was estimated using the NHANES dietary
recall (first day) data and the following federally sponsored
linked databases: MyPyramid Equivalents Database (http:
//www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/12355000/foodlink
/mped2/MPED_2.exe), Food Intakes Converted to Retail
Commodities (http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm
?docid=21993), What We Eat in America (http://www.ars.usda
.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=13793), and National Nutrient
Database for Standard Reference (http://www.ars.usda.gov
/main/site_main.htm?modecode=80-40-05-25). Detailed
methods of the subsidy score calculation are described
elsewhere.10 We categorized the subsidy score into quartiles,
identified empirically within the sample (Q1 is 0.00-0.47,
Q2 is 0.48-0.57, Q3 is 0.58-0.65, and Q4 is 0.66-1.00).
Cardiometabolic Risk Measures
We used the following 6 variables to characterize cardiometa-
bolic risk status: body mass index (BMI) (calculated as weight
in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), ratio of
waist circumference to height, circulating high-sensitivity
C-reactiveprotein(CRP)level(amarkerofinflammation),blood
pressure,non–high-densitylipoprotein(HDL)cholesterollevel,
and glycated hemoglobin level. We categorized each variable
into 3 categories using cut points that were defined clinically
Key Points
Question Is an individual’
s consumption of foods derived from
subsidized food commodities associated with adverse
cardiometabolic risk?
Findings In this cross-sectional analysis of adults in the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, being among the highest
quartile of subsidized food consumers was associated with having
a higher probability of cardiometabolic risk.
Meaning Food commodity subsidies support the production of
foods associated with adverse cardiometabolic risk, and
supporting the production of foods associated with
cardiometabolic health may help improve population health.

(BMI, blood pressure, non-HDL cholesterol level, and gly-
cated hemoglobin level) or empirically (ratio of waist circum-
ference to height and CRP level). Table 1 lists these domains
and categories.
We also created dichotomized categories of each cardio-
metabolic risk factor. These included obesity (BMI ≥30) vs no
obesity, abdominal adiposity (ratio of waist circumference to
height ≥0.60) vs no abdominal adiposity, elevated CRP level
(≥0.32 mg/dL) vs normal CRP level, hypertension (diagnosed
[self-reported] or undiagnosed [no self-reported diagnosis and
systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pres-
sure ≥90 mm Hg] hypertension or currently taking antihyper-
tensive medication) vs normotensive, dyslipidemia (diag-
nosed [self-reported] or undiagnosed [no self-reported
diagnosis and non-HDL cholesterol level ≥160 mg/dL] dyslip-
idemia or currently taking anticholesterolemia medication) vs
normal lipid levels, and dysglycemia (self-reported diabetes
diagnosis or glycated hemoglobin level ≥5.7%) vs no dysgly-
cemia. To convert CRP level to nanomoles per liter, multiply
by 9.524; cholesterol level to millimoles per liter, multiply by
0.0259; and glycated hemoglobin level to proportion of total
hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01.

Race/ethnicity was categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, Mexican American, and other. Educational at-
tainment was categorized as less than high school graduate,
high school graduate, some college, and college graduate or
more. We categorized the poverty income ratio according to
eligibility for food assistance programs as follows: less than
130% of the poverty level (eligible for the Supplemental Nu-
tritionAssistanceProgramandfreeschoolmeals),atleast130%
but less than 185% of the poverty level (eligible for the Special

dren), and at least 185% of the poverty level. We categorized
smoking status (current, past, or never) and at least 10 min-
utes of leisure time moderate or vigorous physical activity over
the past 30 days (yes or no).
We also examined the distribution of the subsidy score
across categories of self-reported household food security sta-
tus (fully food secure, marginally food secure, food insecure
without hunger, or food insecure with hunger). Last, we in-
vestigated whether the associations between high consump-
tion of subsidized commodity foods and cardiometabolic risk
remainedaftercontrollingforoveralldietqualityusingthe2010
Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010),14 a measure representing ad-
herence to federal dietary guidance (2010 Dietary Guidelines
for Americans).
Statistical Analysis
We used statistical analysis software (SAS, version 9.4; SAS In-
stitute and SAS-callable SUDAAN, version 10.0; RTI Interna-
tional). These programs accounted for the NHANES complex
design and dietary sampling weights so that characteristics of
the represented population could be correctly described.
Using weighted proportions and means with standard er-
rors,weexaminedpopulationcharacteristicsoverallandacross
subsidy score quartiles. We used linear regression to estimate
the mean (95% CI) cardiometabolic risk factor levels for US
adults across subsidy score quartiles, adjusted for age, sex, and
race/ethnicity. We used multivariate logistic regression to es-
timate the probability of each cardiometabolic risk factor at
each quartile of the subsidy score, adjusting for demographic
and behavioral covariates (eg, sex, age, race/ethnicity, educa-
tional attainment, poverty income ratio, smoking status, mod-
erate or vigorous leisure time physical activity, and total daily
caloric intake) and then further adjusting for the HEI-2010. We
also used logistic regression to examine the associations be-
tween the continuous subsidy score and each dichotomized
cardiometabolic risk factor. Individuals with missing data

all and by subsidy score quartiles. Overall, 50.5% of our study
sample were male, and this percentage did not vary signifi-

56.2% of calories consumed were from the major subsidized
food commodities. On average, individuals eating the high-
est proportion of subsidized foods (Q4) were younger than in-
dividuals in Q1. Quartile 4 also contained a higher proportion
of Mexican Americans and a lower proportion of non-
Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks compared with Q1
(P < .001). Compared with Q1, individuals in Q4 tended to be
significantly less educated, poorer, and less food secure
(P < .001 for all). From subsidy score Q1 to Q4, current smok-
ing status increased (P < .001), and leisure time physical ac-
tivity decreased (P = .006).

a Numbers are proportions (SEs) unless otherwise stated. Because of missing
values, the categories do not sum to the total 10 308 for some demographic
characteristics. Subsidy score quartiles were defined as follows: Q1 is 0.00 to
0.47, Q2 is 0.48 to 0.57, Q3 is 0.58 to 0.65, and Q4 is 0.66 to 1.00. Poverty
income ratio was defined as at least 185% of the poverty level (higher income),
at least 130% to less than 185% (eligible for the Special Supplemental Program
for Women, Infants, and Children but not the Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program), and less than 130% of the poverty level (eligible for the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and free school meals). Leisure

score quartiles and the corresponding prevalence ratios after
adjusting for sociodemographic factors. The eTable in the
Supplement lists the predicted marginal probability and
prevalence ratios of the 3-level cardiometabolic risk factors
across subsidy score quartiles. In the fully adjusted model in
Table 4, compared with Q1, those in Q4 had a 37% higher
probability of being obese (prevalence ratio, 1.37; 95% CI,
1.23-1.52), a 41% higher probability of having abdominal adi-
posity (prevalence ratio, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.25-1.59), a 34%
higher probability of having an elevated CRP level (preva-
lence ratio, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.19-1.51), a 14% higher probability
of having dyslipidemia (prevalence ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.05-
1.25), and a 21% higher probability of having dysglycemia
(prevalence ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.04-1.40). We found no sta-
tistically significant associations between blood pressure
and the subsidy score. Moreover, further adjusting for over-
all diet quality using the HEI-2010 did not significantly
change the results. The Figure shows the associations
between the continuous subsidy score and the dichotomized
cardiometabolic risk factors.
Discussion
More than half of all calories consumed by nonelderly adults
intheUnitedStatesduringthe6-yearperiodfrom2001to2006
originatedfromsubsidizedfoodcommodities.Adjustedforso-
ciodemographic and lifestyle factors, being among the high-
est quartile of subsidized food consumers was associated with
having a 14% to 41% higher probability of cardiometabolic risk
as measured by BMI, abdominal adiposity, CRP level, and lipid
levels. These associations remained robust to adjustment for
overall diet quality.
Our findings suggest that better alignment of agricul-
tural and nutritional policies may have the potential to
improve the distribution of risk factors for cardiometabolic
disease and may help clarify the ongoing debate about the
role of agricultural subsidies on health. Public health and
nutrition professionals have noted a link between agricul-
tural policy and obesity and cardiometabolic risk and have
called for elimination of agricultural subsidies or at least a
shift to include healthier crops.15-18 However, it has also been
argued that farm policies do not contribute to obesity and
that their elimination would actually increase caloric intake
in the United States,19-21 but 1 noteworthy limitation of that
work is that it considers total calories (and obesity) rather
than quality of calories (and cardiometabolic risk). There-
fore, a key strength and contribution of our analysis is the
consideration of diet quality (composition) rather than just
quantity of calories. In a previous publication, our group
showed that diets of individuals with higher subsidy scores
tended to be rich in high-fat dairy, grains, and meat products
and poor in fruits and vegetables and overall diet quality (as
measured by the HEI-2010).10
Moreover, previous research has described the effect of
socioeconomic status on cardiometabolic health in the
United States, with poorer and less educated individuals
more likely to have poor cardiometabolic health.22,23 Our
group has previously shown that younger, poorer, less edu-
cated, and less food-secure individuals consumed diets with
disproportionately higher proportions of subsidized food
commodities.10 The present finding that higher subsidy
scores are associated with adverse cardiometabolic risk
highlights the effect that agricultural subsidies may be hav-
ing on health disparities in the United States, in part due to
the lower cost per calorie of unhealthier food and the higher
cost per calorie of healthier food.24 This observation has
implications for food security because these same popula-
tion groups may also be restricted by the amount of money
they have available to meet their nutritional requirements.
For example, higher prices for healthy foods have been
found to be associated with increased blood glucose level
among people with type 2 diabetes, and this association is
especially pronounced among low-income individuals with
diabetes.25
Our findings, taken together with our group’
s previous
publication showing that diets of individuals with a higher
subsidy score tend to be of lower nutritional quality,10 sup-
port previous calls to realign agricultural policies with nutri-
tional needs in the modern era of increasing cardiometabolic
diseases.7 But what can be done? One potential policy lever
for addressing this need may be to shift agricultural subsi-
dies toward the production of healthier crops, such as fruits
and vegetables. A successful example comes from Finland’
s
berry project in the latter 20th century.26,27 By molding a
collaboration among berry farmers, industry, commercial
sectors, and health authorities with financing from the Min-
istry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Commerce, many
farmers switched from dairy to berry production, dairy con-
sumption declined, and local berry consumption gradually
rose in Finland.27-29 This berry project was part of the larger
North Karelia Project,29 which by the year 2000 helped
reduce countrywide cardiovascular disease mortality by
80% (attributed to dietary changes and dramatic reductions
in cardiometabolic risk factors like hypertension, hypercho-
lesterolemia, and smoking) and all-cause mortality by
45%, as well as increase male life expectancy by 7 years.30
Although since our period of study (2001-2006) food subsi-
dies in the United States have changed in scope and there are
now several initiatives to increase fruit and vegetable
production,31 there is still much more that can be done.
Because the present study is cross-sectional, future
research is still needed to investigate whether there is a tem-
poral relationship between consumption of subsidized foods
and cardiometabolic risks and diseases. In addition, we need
robust modeling of how changes to current subsidy struc-
tures would alter the production and consumption of vari-
ous foods and resulting health outcomes. Although other
related diet quality indexes (eg, the HEI-2010) exist, the sub-
sidy score provides additional benefit for better understand-
ing the role of subsidized foods on health independent of
overall diet quality.
There are some limitations to our analysis. First, a single
day of 24-hour dietary recall in the NHANES was used to
assess diet and create the subsidy score, and the residual
intrapersonal variability may decrease differences between

demographic subgroups. However, a single 24-hour recall
provides greater detail on the specific types and amounts of
food eaten than a food-frequency questionnaire. Second, the
subsidy score has its limitations. For example, it was not
possible to directly calculate the amount of high-fructose
corn syrup in foods or the exact proportion of subsidized

Obesity was defined as a body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms
divided by height in meters squared) of at least 30. Abdominal adiposity was
defined as a ratio of waist circumference to height of at least 0.60.
Hypertension was defined as diagnosed (self-reported) or undiagnosed (no
self-reported diagnosis and systolic blood pressure �140 mm Hg or diastolic
blood pressure �90 mm Hg) hypertension or currently taking antihypertensive
medication. Dyslipidemia was defined as diagnosed (self-reported) or
undiagnosed (no self-reported diagnosis and non–high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol level �160 mg/dL) dyslipidemia or currently taking
anticholesterolemia medication. Dysglycemia was defined as self-reported
diabetes diagnosis or glycated hemoglobin level of at least 5.7%. Elevated
C-reactive protein level was defined as at least 0.32 mg/dL. To convert
cholesterol level to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259; C-reactive protein
level to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524; and glycated hemoglobin level to

meat that is consumed as processed vs unprocessed due to
incomplete nutritional and ingredient information for foods
reported in the NHANES. In addition, some by-products of
subsidized commodities (eg, soy lecithin) are not captured
by our analysis because these by-products are not traced
through the food system. However, the amount of these
by-products in foods is negligible, and their exclusion is
unlikely to affect the results significantly. Third, the cross-
sectional nature of this study does not allow inference of
causality. We have not demonstrated that the agricultural
subsidies themselves are responsible for the current cardio-
metabolic risk burden in the United States, but rather that
agricultural subsidies are one part of the entire panoply of
cardiometabolic risk factors, some of which include poverty,
cheap food, poor dietary choices, and fewer options. Fourth,
a limitation of the study is the potential for unmeasured con-
founding. Although we controlled for known demographic
and lifestyle risk factors, many important risk factors, such
as smoking, physical activity, poverty, and food insecurity,
increased across subsidy score quartiles, suggesting that
there may be other relevant risk factors for which we were
unable to control.

How Society Subsidizes Big Food and Poor Health
Raj Patel, PhD
Approximately 80% of calories eaten in the United States
are grown domestically.1 Yet, the US diet is a leading cause of
morbidity. The analysis by Siegel et al2 in this issue of JAMA
Internal Medicine suggests that through commodity subsi-
dies that encourage poor diet we are, in part, paying for our
own demise.
However, commodity subsidies are a small part of a big-
ger problem. From 2014 to 2023, the 2014 US Farm Bill will
cost $956 billion (letter from D. W. Elmendorf to Frank D.
Lucas, chair of the House Committee on Agriculture; http:

/hr2642LucasLtr.pdf), of
whichdirectsupportforcom-
modity production is only $44.5 billion over 10 years. Further-
more, among a range of agricultural products, farmers re-
ceive the greatest share of the retail price in beef and milk at
50% compared with only 7% for processed food, such as bread.
So, while processed food prices may be low, commodity sub-
sidies are not the primary cause.
To understand better how the Farm Bill affects food con-
sumption in the United States, consider the Bill’
s largest com-
ponent, namely, support for low-income families to buy food.
Although initially introduced between 1939 and 1943, food
stamps were made a permanent part of US social policy in the
early 1960s, were joined to farm supports in the 1970s, and be-
came the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)
in 2008. SNAP is now the largest part of the Farm Bill, respon-
sible for $756 billion of the spend, and 65 million households
are eligible for the benefits today, although only 47 million
take advantage of it (letter from D. W. Elmendorf to Frank D.
Lucas, chair of the House Committee on Agriculture; http:
//www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments
/hr2642LucasLtr.pdf).
One response has been to see SNAP as a way to shape pref-
erencesamongthosewithlowincomes,whichismisguided.The
poorest families spend a greater share of their food budget on
fresh fruits and vegetables and cook at home far more than the
richest families.3 Furthermore, such restrictions may not be ef-
fective. Most important, while the subsidy is a necessary sup-
port to families on low incomes, it is also a substantial gift to
one of the largest players in the food system. The Wall Street
Journal reports that Walmart “rakes in about 18% of total US
outlays on food stamps” (http://www.wsj.com/articles
/SB10001424052702303843104579168011245171266). As the
largest grocery store and therefore the most visited conduit
for benefits to support low-income shoppers, Walmart finds
SNAP a reliable source of revenue. Assuming the trend
continues, $136 billion of the next Farm Bill will be spent at the
world’
s largest retailer, which points to a more general
phenomenon around agricultural subsidies that many of its
ultimate beneficiaries are large corporations operating within
the food system.
The Farm Bill supports farmers, although not quite in the
way that advocates of agricultural subsidy reform might think.
Farmer debt has increased since the farm crisis of the mid-
1980s. Subsidies are vital for highly indebted farmers to pay
their creditors. Not all farmers benefit from government sup-
port: previous Farm Bills have supported approximately 40%
of US farmers, with the rest being ineligible for subsidy. Al-
though some among the beneficiaries are larger-scale enter-
prises, many are not. Yanking away the income on which many
depend will do little to help and may cause harm.
