Background:
 It
 is
 generally
 acknowledged
 that  e-cigarettes
 are  unlikely
 to  be as harmful
 as  conventional
cigarettes,
 but  there
 is little  data  that quantifies
 their  relative
 harms.
 We  investigated
 the biological
response
 to e-cigarette
 aerosol
 exposure
 (versus
 conventional
 cigarette
 smoke  exposure)
 at
 the  cel-
lular
 level,  by  exposing
 human
 coronary
 artery  endothelial
 cells  (HCAEC)
 to  aqueous
 filtered
 extracts
of
 e-cigarette
 aerosol
 or  cigarette
 smoke
 and  looking
 at  gene
 expression
 changes
 consistent
 with
 a
stress
 response.
 This  included  genes
 controlled
 by  the oxidant-stress
 sensing  transcription
 factor
 NFR2
(NFE2L2),
 and  cytochrome
 P450  family
 members.
Methods:
 Cigarette  smoke
 extract  (CSE)  was  created
 using  mainstream
 smoke
 from
 a
 single  cigarette
drawn
 through  10  ml  of endothelial
 cell  growth
 media  MV2.  Electronic
 cigarette
 aerosol
 extract
 (eCAE)
was
 created
 using
 the  same
 apparatus,
 using  a constant
 power
 output
 of  10.8
 w (4.2  V) and
 18
 mg/ml
nicotine
 solution.
 eCAE
 was  generated
 using  5  cycles  of  5 s
 heat  with  at  least  10  s  in  between
 each  puff
to
 allow  the  coil  to  cool,  air  being  drawn  through
 the  device
 at  70  ml/minute.
Results:
 HCAEC
 responded
 to  the noxious
 components
 in  CSE,  resulting
 in  activation
 of  NRF2
 and
 upreg-
ulation
 of cytochrome
 p450.  However,
 eCAE
 did  not  induce  NRF2  nuclear  localisation,
 upregulation
 of
NRF2-activated
 genes,
 or the upregulation
 of
 cytochrome
 p450.
Conclusions:
 The  use  of  e-cigarettes
 as  a substitute
 for  conventional
 cigarettes
 is
 likely  to
 reduce
 imme-
diate
 tobacco-related
 harm,  at  least  with  respect  to  cardiovascular
 harms.

 Introduction
The
 rapid
 growth
 in
 the
 use
 of
 e-cigarettes,
 which
 deliver
 nico-
tine
 via
 inhaled
 aerosol
 rather
 than
 tobacco
 smoke,
 has
 generated
debate
 regarding
 their
 potential
 benefits
 relative
 to
 conventional
cigarettes.
 While
 e-cigarettes
 are
 unlikely
 to
 be
 as
 harmful
 as
 con-
ventional
 cigarettes,
 there
 is
 little
 data
 that
 quantifies
 their
 likely
relative
 harms,
 and
 data
 does
 not
 yet
 exist
 on
 the
 correlates
 of
long-term
 e-cigarette
 use.
 Given
 this,
 the
 development
 of
 labo-
ratory
 models
 that
 quantify
 the
 biological
 effects,

likely
 relative
 harms,
 of
 e-cigarettes
 and
 conventional
 cigarettes
 is
critical.
The
 levels
 of
 chemicals
 known
 to
 be
 harmful
 present
 in
 e-
cigarette
 aerosol
 depend
 on
 several
 variables
 such
 as
 the
 solution
used
 and
 the
 battery
 output
 voltage
 (Bahl
 et
 al.,
 2012;
 Kosmider
et
 al.,
 2014).
 Critically,
 a
 number
 of
 these
 experiments
 have
 been
performed
 with
 diluted
 refill
 solutions
 (e-liquid),
 rather
 than
heated
 aerosol
 (Bahl
 et
 al.,
 2012).
 The
 levels
 of
 toxic
 product
 will
depend
 on
 the
 way
 the
 e-cigarette
 is
 used
 (Farsalinos
 et
 al.,
 2015).
Moreover,
 the
 mere
 presence
 of
 detectable
 levels
 of
 potentially
harmful
 chemicals
 does
 not
 necessarily
 indicate
 that
 e-cigarette
aerosol
 will
 deliver
 concentrations
 required
 for
 the
 chemical
 to
 be
toxic.
 In
 the
 absence
 of
 long-term
 prospective
 data
 on
 the
 health
correlates
 of
 e-cigarette
 use,
 there
 is
 a
 need
 to
 investigate
 the
potential
 harmful
 effects
 of
 e-cigarette
 use.
 One
 valuable
 approach
might
 be
 to
 examine
 the
 biological
 response
 of
 human
 primary
 cells
to
 e-cigarette
 aerosol.

The
 oxidant-stress
 sensing
 transcription
 factor
 NFR2
 (nuclear
factor,
 erythroid
 2-like
 2,
 NFE2L2)
 is
 normally
 sequestered
 in
 the
cytoplasm
 through
 interaction
 with
 kelch-like
 ECH-associated
 pro-
tein
 1
 (KEAP1),
 but
 this
 interaction
 is
 disrupted
 upon
 electrophilic
attack,
 allowing
 NFR2
 to
 translocate
 to
 the
 nucleus
 and
 activate
gene
 expression
 (Müller
 and
 Hengstermann,
 2012).
 As
 such,
 activa-
tion
 of
 the
 NRF2
 system
 is
 a
 useful
 cellular
 biomarker
 of
 biologically
relevant
 levels
 of
 free
 radicals.
 Combustion
 products
 of
 tobacco
activate
 NFR2-regulated
 gene
 expression
 in
 the
 lung
 and
 initi-
ate
 a
 transcription
 profile
 that
 contributes
 to
 protection
 from
 the
stress
 induced
 by
 tobacco
 smoke
 (Rangasamy
 et
 al.,
 2004;
 Iizuka
et
 al.,
 2005;
 Müller
 and
 Hengstermann,
 2012).
 The
 role
 of
 NRF2
in
 the
 vasculature
 is
 less
 clear;
 modest
 activation
 by
 physiological
laminar
 flow
 is
 thought
 to
 protect
 endothelial
 cells
 from
 oxida-
tive
 stress
 (Zakkar
 et
 al.,
 2009).
 However,
 when
 crossed
 with
 a
hyperlipidaemic
 mouse,
 the
 Nrf2
 knockout
 mouse
 develops
 less
atherosclerosis,
 suggesting
 NRF2
 activation
 contributes
 to
 disease
progression
 (Barajas
 et
 al.,
 2011).
 The
 upregulation
 of
 cytochrome
P450
 family
 members
 by
 cigarette
 smoke
 has
 also
 been
 reported
previously,
 indicating
 they
 are
 another
 biomarker
 of
 toxic
 com-
pounds
 found
 in
 cigarette
 smoke
 (Baker
 et
 al.,
 2001;
 Zevin
 and
Benowitz,
 1999).
We investigated
 the
 biological
 response
 to
 e-cigarette
 aerosol
exposure
 and
 conventional
 cigarette
 smoke
 exposure
 at
 the
 cellular
level,
 by
 exposing
 primary
 human
 coronary
 artery
 endothelial
 cells
to
 aqueous
 filtered
 extracts
 of
 aerosol
 or
 smoke
 and
 measuring
 gene
expression
 changes
 consistent
 with
 a
 stress
 response.

 Methods
2.1.
 Generation
 of
 cigarette
 smoke
 extract
 and
 electronic
cigarette
 aerosol
 extract
Cigarette
 smoke
 extract
 (CSE)
 was
 created
 using
 mainstream
smoke
 from
 a
 single
 Marlboro
 Gold
 cigarette
 (7
 mg  tar,
 0.6
 mg  nico-
tine)
 drawn
 through
 10
 ml
 of
 endothelial
 cell
 growth
 media
 MV2
(Promocell,
 C-22120)
 at
 a
 rate
 of
 70
 ml/min.
 Under
 these
 condi-
tions,
 the
 cigarette
 was
 consumed
 in
 ∼5.5
 min
 resulting
 in
 ∼385
 ml
of
 mainstream
 smoke
 being
 drawn
 through
 the
 solution.
 Electronic
cigarette
 aerosol
 extract
 (eCAE)
 was
 created
 using
 the
 same
 appa-
ratus,
 using
 an
 iStick
 battery
 at
 constant
 power
 output
 (10.8
 W,
4.2
 V),
 with
 an
 Aerotank
 Mini
 atomiser
 (1.8
 �)
 loaded
 with
 Haven
fluid
 USA
 Mix
 18
 mg/ml
 nicotine
 solution
 (80%
 vegetable
 glycerine,
20%
 propylene
 glycol).
 eCAE
 was
 generated
 using
 5
 cycles
 of
 5
 s
heat
 with
 at
 least
 10
 s
 in
 between
 each
 puff
 to
 allow
 the
 coil
 to
 cool,
with
 air
 being
 drawn
 through
 the
 device
 at
 70
 ml/min.
 A
 visible
vapour
 was
 generated
 using
 these
 conditions.
 A
 fresh
 pre-soaked
heating
 coil
 was
 used
 for
 each
 experiment.
 A
 higher
 power
 output
was
 selected
 for
 generation
 of
 eCAE
 as
 it
 has
 been
 shown
 that

CSE
 and
 eCAE
 were
 filtered
 using
 a
 0.2
 �M
 sterile
 filter
 to
remove
 any
 particulate
 matter
 (to
 sterilise
 the

 and
 also
to
 simulate
 the

 that
 would
 occur
 in
 the

 and
 diluted
to
 10%
 in
 endothelial
 cell
 growth
 media
 before
 being
 added
 to
the
 cell.
 CSE
 and
 eCAE
 were
 used
 immediately
 after
 generation.
Nicotine
 concentrations
 in
 CSE
 and
 eCAE
 were
 measured
 by
 ABS
Laboratories
 Ltd,
 which
 indicated
 that
 both
 contained
 3.5
 �g/ml
 of
nicotine;
 therefore,
 the
 diluted

 Nicotine
 (Sigma,
 N3876)
 was
 diluted
 to
350

 and
 used
 as
 a
 control.

 Tissue
 culture
Human
 coronary
 artery
 endothelial
 cells
 (HCAEC)
 from
 3
 to
 6
 dif-
ferent
 donors,
 passage
 4–5,
 were
 seeded
 in
 6
 well
 plates
 and
 grown
to
 form
 a
 confluent
 monolayer.
 They
 then
 received
 3
 sequential
treatments
 of
 10%
 CSE,
 10%
 eCAE,
 or
 nicotine
 (350
 ng/ml)
 16
 h
 apart,
to
 study
 the
 stable
 effects
 of
 these
 treatments
 on
 cells
 (see
 supple-
mentary
 methods
 and
 model
 validation
 data).
 Cells
 were
 lysed
 16
 h
after
 the
 last
 treatment
 and
 total
 RNA
 isolated
 using
 Purelink
 RNA
mini
 kit
 (Ambion,
 Life
 technologies)
 for
 analysis
 of
 gene
 expression
changes.
We
 independently
 validated
 a
 panel
 of
 NRF2-regulated
 genes
 in
HCAEC
 using
 adenoviral
 overexpression
 of
 NRF2
 (see
 Supplemen-
tary

 and
 used
 this
 panel
 of
 genes
 to
 monitor
 NRF2-regulated
gene
 expression
 in
 response
 to

 (Fig.

2.3.
 Analysis
 of

Quantitative
 PCR
 (qPCR)
 was
 performed
 on

 reverse
transcribed
 total
 RNA
 using
 QuantiTect

 Kit
(Qiagen)
 with
 LightCycler
 480
 SYBR

 Master
 Mix
 (Roche)
using
 primers
 listed
 in
 Supplementary
 Table

 All
 replicates
 were
performed
 using
 primary
 cells
 from
 different
 donors.
 Statistical
analyses
 were
 performed
 using
 a
 oneway
 ANOVA
 with
 Tukey-
Kramer
 post
 hoc
 tests.
2.4.
 Immunocytochemistry
Immunocytochemistry
 to
 detect
 NRF2
 localisation
 was
 per-
formed
 on
 HCAEC
 exposed
 to
 treatments
 for
 2
 h,
 before
 being
fixed
 with
 4%
 paraformaldehyde
 for
 10
 min.
 NRF2
 localisation
 was
detected
 using
 rabbit
 anti-Nrf2
 (Santa
 Cruz
 SC-722)
 and
 cell
 bound-
aries
 using
 mouse
 anti-�catenin
 (BD
 610153).

 Results
We
 selected
 genes
 for
 investigation
 (SRXN1,
 DDIT4L,
 HMOX1,
GCLM,
 OSGIN1,
 PAR4,
 CYP1A1,
 CYP1B1)
 on
 the
 basis
 of
 literature
searches
 and
 previous
 unpublished
 work.
 From
 these,
 we
 selected
six
 (HMOX1,
 GCLM,
 OSGIN1,
 PAR4,
 CYP1A1,
 CYP1B1)
 that
 showed
clear
 evidence
 of
 regulation
 by
 CSE,
 defined
 as
 greater
 that
 two-
fold
 relative
 to
 control,
 and
 compared
 these
 to
 both
 nicotine
 and
eCAE.
3.1.
 CSE
 but
 not
 eCAE
 activates
 the
 oxidative
 stress
 pathway
Upregulation
 of
 HMOX1,
 GCLM,
 OSGIN1
 and
 PAR4
 was
 observed
as
 following
 exposure
 to
 CSE
 (P
 <
 0.05
 v
 all
 other
 treatments,
n
 =
 3–6),
 but
 not
 by
 eCAE
 or
 nicotine.
 This
 suggests
 NRF2
 is
 acti-
vated
 by
 CSE,
 but
 not
 eCAE.
 Immunocytochemistry
 was
 used
 to
analyse
 the
 intracellular
 location
 of
 NRF2.
 Two-hour
 exposure
 to
CSE
 induced
 a
 shift
 in
 NRF2
 from
 a
 predominantly
 cytoplasmic
 to
a
 predominantly
 nuclear
 localisation,
 indicating
 NRF2
 activation
(Fig.
 1B).
3.2.
 CSE
 but
 not
 eCAE
 increases
 expression
 of
 cytochrome
 P450,
IL8
 and
 NTPX1
Of
 the
 different
 p450
 cytochromes
 expressed
 in
 HCAEC,
 two
(CYP1A1,
 CYP1B1)
 were
 upregulated
 by
 CSE
 (Fig.
 2, P
 <
 0.05
 vs
all
 other
 treatments,
 n
 =
 3–6);
 however,
 eCAE
 did
 not
 affect
 gene
expression
 levels.
 We  also
 assessed
 interleukin
 8
 (IL8)
 and
 neuronal
pentraxin
 I
 (NTPX1),
 because
 we  have
 found
 both
 to
 be
 regulated
by
 CSE
 (unpublished
 data).
 We  observed
 that
 CSE
 upregulated
 the
expression
 of
 both
 IL8
 and
 NTPX1,  while
 eCAE
 did
 not.
 Interest-
ingly,
 IL8
 expression
 was
 reduced
 and
 NTPX1
 increased
 by
 nicotine,

 Discussion
We  explored
 gene
 expression
 changes
 consistent
 with
 a
 cellular
response
 to
 perceived
 xenobiotic
 stress,
 activation
 of
 the
 antioxi-
dant
 response
 and
 increases
 in
 cytochrome
 p450,
 in
 response
 to
CSE
 and
 eCAE.
 Our
 results
 indicate
 that
 HCAEC
 respond
 to
 the
noxious
 components
 in
 CSE,
 resulting
 in
 activation
 of
 NRF2
 and
upregulation
 of
 cytochrome
 p450
 (i.e.,
 a
 stress
 response).
 How-
ever,
 eCAE
 did
 not
 induce
 NRF2
 nuclear
 localisation,
 upregulation
of
 NRF2-activated
 genes,
 or
 the
 upregulation
 of
 cytochrome
 p450.
IL8
 directly
 enhances
 endothelial
 cell
 survival,
 proliferation,
 and
matrix
 metalloproteinases
 production
 (Li
 et
 al.,
 2003).
 NPTX1
 is
 a
novel
 epigenetic
 regulation
 gene
 associated
 with
 lung
 cancer
 prog-
nosis
 (Zhou
 et
 al.,
 2015)
 that
 enhances
 the
 level
 of
 endothelial
apoptosis
 (Guzeloglu-Kayisli
 et
 al.,
 2014).
 Interestingly,
 there
 was
a
 difference
 in
 expression
 of
 both
 of
 these
 genes
 between
 nicotine
and
 eCAE,
 despite
 an
 equal
 concentration
 of
 nicotine
 in
 both,
 sug-
gesting
 that
 while
 eCAE
 does
 not
 induce
 the
 same
 stress
 response
as
 CSE,
 there
 is
 a
 biological
 effect
 of
 other
 constituents
 of
 eCAE,
albeit
 one
 that
 does
 not
 reflect
 a
 stress
 response
 in
 our
 model.
This
 study
 used
 primary
 HCAEC
 because
 of
 their
 involve-
ment
 in
 the
 development
 of
 cardiovascular
 disease
 (Sima
 et
 al.,
2009;
 Gimbrone
 Jr.
 and
 García-Carde˜
na,
 2013);
 additionally,
 we
attempted
 to
 create
 conditions
 relevant
 to
 this
 investigation
 by
bubbling
 filtered
 mainstream
 smoke
 through
 tissue
 culture
 media,
which
 was
 filtered
 (0.2
 �m)
 and
 diluted
 before
 being
 added
 to
 cells.
Whilst
 it
 is
 not
 possible
 to
 perfectly
 simulate
 the
 mode
 and
 systemic
effects
 of
 smoking,
 CSE
 contained
 only
 the
 soluble
 components
of
 cigarette
 smoke
 gas
 phase
 and
 not
 the
 tar
 phase
 or
 particu-
lates
 >0.2
 �m.
 This
 made
 conditions
 more
 suitable
 for
 looking
 at
the
 systemic
 vascular
 effects
 of
 cigarette
 smoke,
 as
 opposed
 to
 the
lungs.
 The
 use
 of
 tissue
 culture
 media
 may
 be
 important
 as
 it
 con-
tains
 5%
 serum.
 Highly
 reactive
 chemical
 moieties
 and
 free
 radicals
may
 react
 with
 and
 modify
 the
 proteins
 in
 the
 media
 to
 create
proinflammatory
 adducts,
 which
 in
 turn
 may
 transmit
 some
 of
 the
noxious
 effect
 of
 CSE
 to
 the
 cell,
 similar
 to
 the
 way
 these
 reactants
may
 modify
 plasma
 proteins
 in
 vivo.
 The
 volume
 of
 smoke
 used
 in
our
 model
 corresponds
 to
 roughly
 half
 of
 the
 smoke
 inhaled
 from
 a
low
 tar
 cigarette
 (7–8
 puffs)
 by
 a
 regular
 smoker
 (Djordjevic
 et
 al.,
2000;
 Zacny
 and
 Stitzer,
 1996).
 eCAE
 was
 generated
 in
 an
 identical
manner
 to
 CSE,
 resulting
 in
 the
 same
 concentration
 of
 nicotine
 in
the
 extract
 (3.5
 �g/ml).
There
 are
 some
 limitations
 to
 this
 study
 that
 should
 be
 consid-
ered.
 First,
 we
 investigated
 a
 single
 e-cigarette
 product,
 a
 single
cell
 line,
 and
 a
 limited
 number
 of
 outcomes.
 Therefore,
 our
 results
should
 be
 considered
 preliminary,
 and
 their
 generalizability
 tested
in
 future
 studies
 across
 a
 range
 of
 products,
 fluids,
 device
 settings,
cell
 lines
 and
 outcomes.
 Second,
 our
 puffing
 protocols
 were
 not
designed
 to
 directly
 mimic
 real-world
 smoking
 or
 vaping,
 but
 to
standardise
 nicotine
 exposure.
 Future
 work
 should
 apply
 protocols
that
 mimic
 real-world
 behaviour.
 Third,
 the
 constant
 flow
 rate
 used
to
 produce
 CSE
 means
 that
 spikes
 in
 combustion
 temperature
 will
have
 been
 minimal.
 These
 spikes,
 generated
 by
 puffing,
 generate
large
 yields
 of
 combustion
 products,
 meaning
 the
 effects
 of
 CSE
 we
observed
 may
 in
 fact
 be
 conservative.
 Fourth,
 we
 only
 examined
 the
effects
 of
 CSE
 and
 eCAE
 separately.
 Given
 that
 dual-use
 of
 conven-
tional
 cigarettes
 and
 e-cigarettes
 is
 common,
 future
 models
 should
test
 different
 combinations
 of
 exposure.
Our
 results
 suggest
 that
 the
 use
 of
 e-cigarettes
 as
 a
 substi-
tute
 for
 conventional
 cigarettes
 is
 likely
 to
 reduce
 immediate
tobacco-related
 cardiovascular
 harms.
 The
 absence
 of
 NRF2
 activa-
tion
 or
 upregulation
 of
 cytochrome
 p450
 in
 HCAEC
 suggests
 a
 lower
biological
 impact
 of
 eCAE
 compared
 to
 CSE.
 This
 is
 in
 agreement
with
 other
 studies
 suggesting
 a
 lower
 potential
 disease
 burden
for
 e-cigarette
 use
 compared
 with
 conventional
 cigarettes
 (Oh
 and
Kacker,
 2014;
 Goniewicz
 et
 al.,
 2014).
 In
 the
 absence
 of
 long-term
prospective
 data
 on
 the
 health
 correlates
 of
 e-cigarette
 use,
 there
is
 a
 critical
 need
 to
 valid
 laboratory
 models
 on
 the
 relative
 harms
of
 e-cigarettes
 and
 conventional
 cigarettes
 to
 inform
 the
 ongoing
public
 health
 debate
 regarding
 their
 use.
 This
 study
 identifies
 two
biological
 axes
 for
 analysing
 the
 components
 of
 CSE
 and
 eCAE,
 and
indicates
 CSE
 but
 not
 eCAE
 induces
 a
 stress
 response
 in
 human
 cells.
Conflict
