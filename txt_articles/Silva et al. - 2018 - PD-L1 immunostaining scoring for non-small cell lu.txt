Abstract
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer death globally, and
new immunotherapies developed and under development targeting PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint
inhibition require accurate patient selection to assure good clinical outcome. PD-L1 immu-
nohistochemistry is the current biomarker assay used for patient selection, but still imprecise
in predicting therapy response. Exploring this issue, we performed computational tissue
analysis of PD-L1 immunostaining in procured NSCLC tissues (n = 50) using the Merck
KGaA anti-PD-L1 clone MKP1A07310. Staining patterns and PD-L1 cut-off points were
interrogated using relevant cancer immune-surveillance biomarkers. Groups with high PD-
L1 expression levels (above 25/50% staining cut-off points) were enriched for a biomarker
profile in the tumor-nest and microenvironment indicating escape from host-immunity, as
represented by increased numbers of cells positive for CD8 and Granzyme B (immune-
effectors), FOXP3 (immune-suppressive), and CD68 (P < 0.05). Manual analysis of PD-L1
staining patterns identified tumors with an immune-induced reactive pattern relevant for
immunotherapy that would ordinarily be excluded by the arbitrary 25% staining threshold (P
< 0.05). Conversely, some cases with completely or predominantly immune-independent
constitutive PD-L1 staining patterns that indicate insensitivity to immunotherapy may have
been incorrectly selected using this staining cut-off point criterion. Therefore, we propose
differentiation of reactive vs constitutive PD-L1 staining patterns to improve the accuracy of
this biomarker assay in selecting NSCLC patients for PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy.
Introduction
Lung cancer is the most lethal cancer type worldwide, with non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) accounting for the majority (~85%) of deaths [1]. Late diagnoses of NSCLC contrib-
ute to the high mortality and poor prognoses for those with advanced disease, treated with
platinum-based chemotherapy [2]. Novel immunotherapies that target the Programed Cell

 Death (PD)-1 /ligand (PD-L1) check-point have been approved for NSCLC based on
improved overall response rates in clinical trials using therapeutic monoclonal antibodies
(mAb) directed against PD-1 (Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab) and PD-L1 (Atezolizumab),
while other anti-PD-L1 mAbs (Avelumab and Durvalumab) are at advanced stages of develop-
ment [3–5]. With the current range of options, it is important to understand which patients
will benefit from each new immunotherapy drug. PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays
are the most advanced biomarker strategies in-place for patient screening, as elevated tissue
expression of PD-L1 has been correlated with a higher chance of prolonged post-therapy sur-
vival [3, 4, 6]. However, this approach has attracted some skepticism given that significant
number of patients, even in highly selected cohorts, have treatment outcomes that contradict
predictions based on PD-L1 status [6]. The use of multiple antibodies and staining thresholds
(1–50%) complicates PD-L1 IHC data comparisons [4, 6, 7]. Furthermore, we lack a standard
scoring algorithm for PD-L1 expression patterns in tumor-nests and the tumor microenviron-
ment (TME) [3, 8]. Finally, the biological relevance of PD-L1 staining cut-off points, including
their relationship to other immune biomarkers, remains unknown.
The PD-L1 staining profile targeted by PD-L1/PD-1 immunotherapies should be a reactive
pattern induced by interferon (IFN)-γ secreted by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) at
tumor-nest-TME interfaces [6, 8–10]. This reactive expression, from immune and tumor cells
responsive to IFN-γ, differs from constitutive expression arising from cell-intrinsic genetic/
epigenetic events. A strong and homogeneous constitutive PD-L1 tumor cell staining pattern
in the absence of any appreciable TIL component would predict a futile PD-L1/PD-1 therapeu-
tic intervention [6, 8]. Conversely, a reactive patchy PD-L1 pattern surrounded by T-cell rich
areas implies restraint of a potentially anti-tumoral cytotoxic adaptive response, and a greater
likelihood of anti-PD-L1/PD-1 therapeutic success [11, 12]. PD-L1 negative tumors without
TIL will not respond to PD-1/L1 therapy unless cancer antigens are exposed for a T-cell
response, while genetic events leading to inability to express PD-L1 in the presence of TIL
should identify acquired resistance to PD-1/L1 therapy. Currently, none of the applied PD-L1
scoring algorithms account for patterns that indicate cancer escape from immune surveillance
[6, 9].
This is the first publication to report IHC data for tumor-nest and TME compartments in
NSCLC samples using the Merck KGaA anti-PD-L1 clone MKP1A07310 for Avelumab devel-
opment together with an immune panel of effector and regulatory TIL [13], as well as to show
the effects of PD-L1 staining cut-off points, and the stratification of biologically relevant
PD-L1 staining patterns in tumor-nest and TME compartments. Using Computational Tissue
Analysis (cTA™) capable of scoring entire sections, complementary to another NSCLC digital
study [13], we expanded PD-L1 analyses to include all positively-stained TME cell types as all
may support an immuno-suppressive environment. We demonstrated that simplistic thresh-
olds based on PD-L1 staining amount over a whole section can exclude patients with lower
amounts but potentially therapy-permissive patterns, while including cases with strong label-
ing that is not necessarily related to a restrained adaptive immune response.
Materials and methods
Tissues and immunohistochemistry
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks prepared using surgical resections from 50
treatment-naive NSCLC patients (Table 1) were procured from Indivumed GmbH (Hamburg,
Germany) and processed in our Merck KGaA histopathology laboratory for IHC. Four-
micrometer-thick serial sections were generated per tissue block and immunostained for CD8

 scanning performed at x20. All whole-slide digital images were assessed for scanning artifacts
including blurring due to incomplete cleaning, and ‘stitching’ artifacts. Scanning was repeated
until all slides reached Flagships’ quality criteria for digital scans. Digital images were viewed
using Aperio ImageScope (Leica Biosystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL), with manual annotation
to include region(s) of interest (ROI). Inclusion annotations were made just outside the inva-
sive margin of the tumor mass when present (Fig 1A and 1B), excluding adjacent pre-existing
normal lung and/or pleural tissue and in-situ carcinomatous changes. Exclusion annotations
were made around staining and tissue artifacts including folds and tears, mounting media
artifacts, stain smudges, and other artifacts deemed irreversible in the scanning process. Addi-
tional exclusions were areas of necrosis (Fig 1B), entrapped airway tissue (including hyper-
plastic or metaplastic epithelium), ectopic lymphoid structures, and large intraluminal clusters
of macrophages and/or cellular debris. One tissue sample was dropped from the study due to
widespread anthracosis.
Computational tissue analysis (cTA)
Full scan analysis was performed using Flagship Bioscience’s proprietary cTA image analysis
software system (Westminster, CO, USA) available for research. The platform identified nuclei
in each sample based upon hematoxylin staining, then quantified the intensity of DAB staining

 for each nucleus-identified cell. To identify positive cells, thresholds for DAB staining were set
using biomarker-specific algorithms for CD8, FOXP3, CD56, Granzyme B, CD68, and PD-L1.
For PD-L1, multiple thresholds were identified according to a negative, +1, +2, and +3 scoring
paradigm contiguous with manual scoring approaches (Fig 1C and 1D). The biomarker-spe-
cific algorithms were then further developed on a sample-by-sample basis to assign cells to
either the tumor-nest or TME compartments based on morphometric and/or staining qualities
(Fig 1D). Instances where compartmental separation was impossible due to similar morpholo-
gies of tumor nest and TME cell nuclei, or an insufficient quantity of TME, cell information
was studied from both compartments. Data from these cases were included in the “All Cells”
category and excluded from the solo tumor-nest and TME compartment-specific analyses. All
annotations and image analysis markups were assessed by a pathologist (JPK) to verify perfor-
mance and accuracy. Stained cell counts and the percentage of positive cells for each tissue
sample in every biomarker on a per-compartment basis was performed. Heterogeneity was
further analyzed for PD-L1 stained samples using an algorithm-calculated H-Score within the
tumor-nest compartment, the TME compartment, and the entire tissue sample respectively.
Digital H-scores ranging from 0 to 300 were calculated using the following standard formula:
[3 � % cells +3 intensity] + [2 � % cells +2 intensity] + [1 � % cells +1 intensity].
Pathologist scoring of PD-L1 staining patterns
In addition to the image analysis detailed above, all slide images were reviewed and categorized
according to the PD-L1 staining patterns (I-V) noted in tumor-nest and TME compartments,
including the tumor-nest-TME interfaces (Table 3). The system used was an adaptation/exten-
sion of those previously suggested for cancer classification based on PD-L1 expression by
tumor cells and co-localization with TIL [6, 8]. The aim of this categorization was an attempt
to differentiate between constitutive versus reactive PD-L1 expression (or mixtures of the two)
in order to predict potential responders to PD-1/PD-L1-based immunotherapy [6, 8]. In this
study, we assessed PD-L1 expression by all cell types in the TME compartment rather than
using TIL counts.
Statistical analysis
Hierarchical clustering of the data for all biomarkers was performed using the MATLAB bioin-
formatics toolbox version 2015a (MathWorks, Natick, MA) with Euclidean distance metric

 and average linkage to generate the hierarchical tree. Data were normalized such that the
mean was 0 and the standard deviation was 1 across samples for each marker score. Pearson
correlation coefficients were also calculated between marker measurements and a heatmap
was generated to visualize the strength of the correlations.
Percentages of cells positive for each biomarker were compared for tumors above and
below 5%, 25%, 50%, and 80% cut-off points for PD-L1 immunostaining. These comparisons
were made for the tumor-nest, TME, and “All Cells” compartments. Additionally, positive
PD-L1 percentages, immune cell percentages, and digital H-scores were compared between
the PD-L1 staining pattern categories in the tumor-nest and TME compartments, respectively.
Data were plotted as box-and-whisker plots. Boxes show the median and interquartile range
(IQR) and whiskers show the range of the data excluding outliers. Outliers are defined as data
more than 1.5�IQR beneath the lower quartile or more than 1.5�IQR above the upper quartile.
No data points were removed from analysis. P-values were calculated using a two-tailed Stu-
dent’s t-test, assuming unequal sample variances. The Holm method was used to correct for
multiple comparisons, with a significance threshold of P<0.05 for each subset of analyses.
Results
Correlations between immune biomarkers in tumor-nests and TME
Multiple biomarkers were analyzed in the tumor-nest, TME, and All Cells compartments. This
allowed us to accurately assess the relative proportions of effector and regulatory cells in the
typically heterogeneous NSCLC tissue microenvironment, and their possible relationships. In
a small number of cases (n = 7), it was not possible to separate tumor-nest and TME compart-
ments digitally as the latter was minimal; All Cells scores only were analyzed for those slides.
In the group of cases where a separation between tumor-nest and microenvironment was fea-
sible (n = 43), scores derived from a single marker showed a greater correlation across com-
partments than scores derived from different markers in the same compartment (Fig 2A). For
example, percentages of CD68-positive cells in the tumor-nest and TME compartments had a
Pearson correlation coefficient (ρ) of 0.73, which fell to 0.42 when comparing CD68 and CD8
in the TME alone. However, PD-L1 data showed a lower correlation between the tumor-nest
and TME compartments (ρ = 0.43) than the other markers (Fig 2B). CD56 showed the least
correlation with other markers, while CD8 and Granzyme B (both expressed by cytotoxic T-
cells) showed the greatest association with each other (All Cells ρ = 0.93, P < 0.0001; Fig 2B).
Of the biomarkers beside PD-L1, CD8- and CD68-positive cells had the highest mean percent-
ages in both tumor-nest (10.7%; 8.3%) and TME compartments (11.1%; 13.2%) (Table 4).
Finally, we could not identify significant clustering based on the four NSCLC subtypes repre-
sented in our sample set (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma,
and pleomorphic carcinoma).
Distribution of immune biomarkers relative to frequently used PD-L1 cut-
off points
We compared the distributions of our immune markers relative to PD-L1 positive staining
cut-offs (5, 25, 50, and 80%) currently used in Merck KGaA PD-L1 clinical development pro-
grams. We studied cut-off points in the tumor nest, TME, and All Cells compartments, with a
full analysis of the immune markers in each compartment. A 50% PD-L1 TME cut-off put
only 14% of samples in the high PD-L1 group, increasing to 100% at a 5% PD-L1 TME cut-off.
Whereas, data from tumor-nest cut-offs permitted a more balanced sample size distribution.
For example, using the 25% and 50% PD-L1 tumor-nest cut-offs, approximately half of the

and blue represents weak correlations. No strong negative correlations were observed.

 samples were in the high PD-L1 group (53% and 44%, respectively). A plot of 50% PD-L1
tumor-nest cut-off (most frequently scored by pathologists) for overall immune cell expression
(All Cells) provides a summary of the global changes in cellular distribution for the PD-L1
high/low groups (Fig 3A). Higher percentages (P < 0.05) of stained cells for CD68, CD8,
FOXP3, and Granzyme B were detected in the high PD-L1 group when compared vs the low
PD-L1 group (Fig 3A). Results were similar when comparing immune marker distribution in
the tumor-nest, TME, and All Cells compartments using 25% and 50% PD-L1 tumor-nest cut-
off points (non-shown data). Additionally, we found no significant differences in Granzyme
B/CD8 ratio for the 50% cut-off (P = 0.14), but a higher FOXP3/CD8 ratio beneath the 50%
threshold (P = 0.03). When applying a 5% PD-L1 tumor-nest cut-off, 70% of samples segre-
gated to the high PD-L1 group, with CD8, Granzyme B, and CD68 significantly higher in
those samples (P < 0.05). Statistical comparisons using an 80% PD-L1 tumor-nest cut-off
value were impossible given that only one sample segregated to the high PD-L1 group.
Classification of PD-L1 staining patterns and relation with cut-Off points
The staining patterns for PD-L1 (Table 3) were classified for cases with tumor-nest and TME
compartment data (n = 43) to determine whether any NSCLC case with evidence of reactive
membrane expression would be falsely excluded at certain cut-off points, while some NSCLC
with only constitutive tumor expression might be inappropriately included. Most of the
tumors in this sample set were classified as having pattern I (n = 16) or II (n = 16); both show-
ing PD-L1 expression in tumor cells at the tumor-nest-TME interface that suggested contribu-
tion of a reactive process (Fig 4A and 4B).
In NSCLC classified as pattern I, the tumor cells showed variable percentages of PD-L1
membrane labeling (1+, 2+, and 3+ scores) and positive staining in TME cells (Fig 4A).
Heavier PD-L1 staining of tumor cells adjacent to positive TME cells were observed by the
pathologist in some fields, which varied within and between sections. In tumors classified as
pattern II, the variable staining intensity was largely limited to patches that were often located
at the tumor-nest-TME interface (Fig 4B). PD-L1 positive cells in the TME for pattern I and II
included morphological cellular components compatible with lymphocytes, macrophages,
fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Looking at the other immune biomarkers, CD8 and to lesser
extent CD68, most often showed pronounced infiltration on both sides of the tumor-nest-
TME interface, as opposed to the other immune markers that tended to be more diffusely
arranged in both compartments. Only one tumor showed predominantly negative staining for
PD-L1 in both compartments (tumor-nest and TME), consistent with pattern III (Fig 4C). Pat-
tern IV (diffuse and intense staining of tumor cell membranes with minimal to no TME
expression) was also only noted in one case (Fig 4D). Finally, there were a number of NSCLC

cell staining consistent with pattern V (Fig 4E).
Comparison of tumor groups with patterns I and II revealed a lower percentage of PD-L1
positive cells in the tumor-nests from the group showing pattern II staining (P < 0.00001).
Importantly, most of those pattern II samples fell beneath the cut-off points when applying
50% and 25% PD-L1 tumor-nest thresholds (Fig 4F). However, comparable percentages of
PD-L1-positive TME cells were noted for each of these patterns (Fig 4G). A similar separation
of these two groups could be achieved by using a tumor-nest digital H-score, with pattern I

terms of other immune biomarker cellular percentages (and their digital H-scores), there were
no significant differences between pattern I and II groups for TME or All Cells analyses. How-
ever, the tumor nest compartment for pattern I tumors showed significantly higher percent of

Discussion
Using procured NSCLC tissues from naïve-treated patients with advanced disease, we adopted
the cTA platform to identify and quantify multiple immune biomarkers in tumor-nest and
TME compartments in whole sections. Pivotal to this analysis was the usage of the Merck
KGaA anti-PD-L1 clone MKP1A07310, which is the analytical Ab for the evaluation of Avelu-
mab [5], with same specificity and higher sensitivity than Dako anti-PD-L1 clone 22C3 as
shown in a NSCLC PD-L1 IHC assay comparison study [14]. We demonstrated that all our
immune biomarkers, except for PD-L1, had a strong correlation across tumor-nest and TME
compartments, with CD8 and Granzyme B being the TIL markers with strongest association.
PD-L1 tumor-nest cut-off points, but not TME-related ones, allowed a balanced sample size
distribution that showed similar results at 25 and 50% in terms of TIL-related and non-related
immune biomarkers, clustering higher levels of these immune biomarkers with higher levels
of PD-L1 expression. This is consistent with the hypothesis that higher PD-L1 tumor-nest
expression would be expected in the context of an adaptive immune response to tumor anti-
gens. However, we propose that a simple quantification of PD-L1 immunostaining levels is not
enough to select patients for PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy [6], because cut-off points do not
allow discrimination between constitutive and reactive expression patterns. Our data show
that most cases with a patchy PD-L1 reactive pattern II fell below both 25 and 50% cut-off
points, indicating that they would be excluded from PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy if those cut-
off criteria were used for patient selection. Also, the inclusion of cases with high PD-L1 tumor
expression related to a constitutive expression either alone (pattern IV) or predominant (pat-
tern I) may not necessarily favor therapeutic outcome. In conclusion, we propose that current
scoring systems based simply on amount of staining should be complemented by algorithms
that discriminate between constitutive and reactive PD-L1 staining patterns, being the last one
the appropriate target for PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition.
We have demonstrated enrichment of effector and regulatory immune cell types in groups
with higher PD-L1 expression as defined by IHC thresholds of over 25 and 50%. This included
CD8 and Granzyme B positive cells, with the latter being a marker that highlights functional
effector T-cells [15]. The surprisingly low percentage of Granzyme B+ cells versus total CD8+
cells in our study might be explained by a large proportion of exhausted CD8 T cells [9, 16].
The Granzyme B+/CD8+ ratio did not differ significantly across the 25% and 50% thresholds,
but might not be expected in our particular cohort of patients with advanced disease. Increased
percentages of FOXP3+ cells with higher PD-L1 expression also suggested a tumor cell modu-
lation of the adaptive immune response given that PD-L1/PD-1 interactions promote T-cells
differentiation into regulatory cells [17]. The balance between FOXP3+ and CD8+ T-cells is
another clinically linked parameter, as low-FOXP3/ high-CD8+ ratios have been linked with
positive survival effects across multiple cancer types including NSCLC [18–19]. In the current
study, the FOXP3+/CD8+ ratio was lower in NSCLC above the 50% PD-L1 cut-off point, but
this result does not necessarily indicate a favorable TME for an adaptive anti-tumoral immune
response due to the likelihood that most of those TIL are exhausted. Overall, these results sup-
port using PD-L1 immunostaining cut-off points to select patients with higher chances of
responding to PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition, as they are consistent with previous positive

 correlations of PD-L1 expression, numbers of TIL, and longer overall survival in NSCLC and
other solid tumors [15, 20–21, 22–23]. However, our further analysis of PD-L1 staining pat-
terns in tumor-nests and TME suggested the need to take into account this additional aspect.
The categorization of tumor PD-L1 expression patterns related to TIL distribution has been
discussed previously, suggesting clear guidelines for checkpoint inhibition immunotherapy [6,
8]. This approach may simplify PD-L1 scoring paradigms, but detracts from complex immu-
nologic read-outs reflecting the contribution from various combinations of immune biomark-
ers. In fact, tumor-associated macrophages, fibroblasts, dendritic cells, and even endothelial
cells can modulate immune responses via PD-L1 expression [16, 24–30]. PD-L1 may also be
expressed on T-cells themselves [31]. Cells with morphologies consistent with all these cell
types were found to express variable PD-L1 labeling intensities in our tissue sections classified
as pattern I, II and V. Moreover, these PD-L1 expressing cells have been previously shown to
be therapeutically important, as positive responses to Atezolizumab were enriched in NSCLC
when PD-L1 was expressed by infiltrating immune cells [31]. In fact, absence of PD-L1 expres-
sion in the immune infiltrate was categorized as a “non-functional immune response” [31].
PD-L1 expression in TME immune and non-immune cells could be an over-arching bio-
marker for the anti-tumor response, allowing selection of appropriate patients for checkpoint
inhibitor immunotherapy. However, it is unknown which are the characteristics of the PD-L1
staining required in the TME (pattern I, II and V) for a successful therapeutic intervention. In
our study, the TME expression of PD-L1 alone did not facilitate separation of patients using
cut-off points, but it’s relationship to tumor cell staining in the context of our PD-L1 pattern
classification system (I-V) suggested why simple cut-off points may exclude therapy-respon-
sive patients, while including some who are unlikely to respond.
The analysis of PD-L1 staining patterns of tumor cells was performed to titrate the presence
of morphological structures where PD-L1/PD-1 interactions should occur like an ‘immuno-
logic synapse’. This is the classic TCR/antigen presentation interface where T-cell immune
activation and inhibitory signals interplay [32]. In our tissue context, localization of TIL at the
tumor-nest-TME interface and among other PD-L1-expressing cell types within the TME
compartment (captured in our pattern I, II and V) provide ample opportunities for PD-L1/
PD-1 interactions to attenuate or paralyze any adaptive immune response. This physical inter-
action was most clearly seen in our staining pattern II, which had a prominent and patchy
tumor-nest-TME interface (Fig 4B). In contrast, where PD-L1 expression by the tumor cells is
diffuse, often intense, and not only localized to the interface (patterns I or III), it is logical to
assume that this expression reflects tumoral-intrinsic events related to genetic mutation or epi-
genetic disturbance [6]. Such tumors will tend to be given high scores that are out of propor-
tion to the numbers of infiltrating immune cells [33], although many of such cases in our
study did also contain interface components (pattern I). We hypothesized that NSCLC tissues
with interface-only staining (pattern II) as well as the cases showing mixed interface and dif-
fuse staining (pattern I) contain inducible PD-L1/PD-1 interactions potentially adequate for
therapeutic blocking. Of note, current NSCLC PD-L1 scoring methods do not allow us to
identify patterns I and II [3], as traditional cut-off point fail to recognize these essential inter-
actions at the interface. Moreover, we have shown that most of the pattern II tumors fell below
a 25% and 50% cut-off points, which are commonly used in current scoring methods [3]. Also,
these methods will not assess if a sufficient extent and/or magnitude of adaptive immunity is
present to select patients who could benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 therapeutic intervention. In
fact, some pattern II tumors may contain a more extensive and targetable adaptive immune
response than those included in the pattern I category. Setting a lower tumor cell cut-off point
(e.g. 1% or 5%) risks including pattern II without sufficient immunological synapse interfaces,
while still including potentially recalcitrant pattern I or III tumors. Then, current scoring

 algorithms based on amount of staining should be complemented with qualitative algorithms
that allow the discrimination between constitutive and relevant reactive PD-L1 staining
patterns.
In conclusion, using our cTA analysis of PD-L1 immunostaining relative to immune bio-
markers that might be involved in NSCLC immune surveillance during this late disease stage,
we demonstrated that groups with high levels of PD-L1 defined by cut-off points of 25 and
50% enriched also for higher amounts of FOxP3, CD8, Granzyme B, and CD68 positive cells
in tumor-nest and TME. This association between high levels of PD-L1 and increased effector
and suppressor adaptive as well as augmented innate immune tumor infiltrates may reflects
escape from a potential host anti-tumoral immune response. Furthermore, high amounts of
PD-L1 in NSCLC defined by these or other cut-off points may not accurately predict if anti-
PD-1/PD-L1 therapy will successfully unleash a host anti-tumoral immune response. Selection
of a specifically reactive PD-L1 staining pattern within regions of the tumor architecture
where immunological synapses are formed is likely to be required for more accurate determi-
nation of which patients will benefit from this therapeutic intervention. We anticipate that the
current data may trigger a new way to analyze clinical trial specimens, because discrimination
between constitutive and reactive PD-L1 staining patterns should improve the precision of
immunotherapy patient selection.
