IMPORTANCE Understanding of personality as an independent risk factor for serious mental
illness (SMI) remains limited. Recently, overlap between the polygenic basis for specific
personality traits and specific SMIs has been identified.
OBJECTIVE To determine the association of the adolescent personality domains of social
maturity, mental energy, and emotional stability with later diagnosis of SMI.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This longitudinal cohort study enrolled Swedish male
military conscripts aged 18 or 19 years from January 1, 1974, through December 31, 1997.
The diagnosis of an SMI was extracted from the National Patient Register for all inpatient
treatment episodes in Sweden from January 1, 1974, through December 31, 2011. Data were
analyzed from May 3 to September 16, 2016.
EXPOSURES Social maturity, mental energy, and emotional stability assessed at conscription
interview.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Inpatient diagnoses of bipolar disorder, schizoaffective
disorder, schizophrenia, and other nonaffective psychoses occurring until December 31, 2011.
RESULTS Of the 1 017 691 men included in the cohort, 4310 developed bipolar disorder; 784,
schizoaffective disorder; 4823, schizophrenia; and 5013, other nonaffective psychoses. After
adjustment, with use of mean scores as a reference, low social maturity (hazard ratio [HR],
1.61; 95% CI, 1.48-1.74), low mental energy (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.24-1.44), and low emotional
stability (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.40-1.63) were inversely associated with schizophrenia in a
dose-dependent fashion. Other nonaffective psychoses displayed a similar pattern. Bipolar
disorder was associated with high (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.09-1.35) and low (HR, 1.12; 95% CI,
1.01-1.25) social maturity and low emotional stability (HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.46-1.78).
Schizoaffective disorder was associated with low emotional stability (HR, 1.53; 95% CI,
1.26-1.85).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Emotional stability is inversely associated with all SMI. Bipolar
disorder has a unique U-shaped association with social maturity. Premorbid personality may
reflect subtle changes in cerebral function, may combine with symptoms and other
neurocognitive deficits to influence illness presentation, and/or may be owing to shared
genetic architecture.

K
raepelin1 first raised the question of whether specific
premorbid personality traits reflect an early stage of ill-
ness or a genetic disposition to serious mental illness
(SMI). However, our understanding of personality as an inde-
pendent risk factor for SMI remains limited. Recently, a poly-
genic basis for neuroticism and a shared genetic architecture
with schizophrenia has been found,2,3 with inconsistent re-
sultsforbipolardisorder.2-4Furthermore,polygenicriskscores
for bipolar disorder are associated with extraversion.5 This re-
search has prompted renewed interest in the association be-
tween personality and SMI.6
Low extraversion and high neuroticism have been iden-
tifiedasfeaturesinpatientswithnonaffectivepsychosis7-11and
bipolar disorder.12 However, these studies do not elucidate the
temporal association between personality and SMI. A small
numberoflongitudinalcohortstudieshavefoundthatlowself-
esteem and neuroticism are present before development of
nonaffective psychotic symptoms13,14 and before diagnosis of
schizophrenia.15-17 Personality-related risk factors for bipolar
disorder and schizoaffective disorder have been less fre-
quently investigated. One study found high extraversion was
associated with bipolar disorder.15 In general, however, evi-
denceofapremorbiddiathesisinbipolardisorderislacking.17-19
We used data from Swedish conscript interviews to examine
whether premorbid social maturity (including extraversion),
mental energy, and emotional stability (including neuroti-
cism) were associated with development of bipolar disorder,
schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, and other nonaffec-
tive psychotic disorders.

Key Points
Question Are adolescent personality traits (social maturity,
mental energy, and emotional stability) associated with the risk
for subsequent serious mental illness (bipolar disorder,
schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, and other nonaffective
psychoses)?
Findings In this nationwide longitudinal cohort study of more
than 1 million Swedish men, social maturity, mental energy, and
emotional stability had a dose-response association with
schizophrenia and other psychotic illnesses. Bipolar disorder had
a unique U-shaped association with social maturity (with high and
low levels increasing risk).
Meaning Individuals who develop serious mental illnesses have
different patterns of premorbid personality, and genetic
architecture for personality traits and serious mental illness may
be shared.

Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed from May 3 to September 16, 2016. We as-
sessedtheassociationbetweenpersonalitymeasuresusingpoly-
choric correlations. Cox proportional hazard regression analy-
ses compared SMI rates in individuals with high, average, and
low levels of social maturity, mental energy, and emotional sta-
bility (with the average levels as a reference). We investigated
the proportionality assumption using Schoenfeld residuals.35
We performed a complete case analysis in which individuals
missing psychological or IQ assessments at baseline were ex-
cluded. Individuals who had admissions for SMI before their
conscriptioninterviewwereexcludedfromtheanalysis,aswere
individuals who were assessed as having psychosis at the con-
scription interview (this assessment was completed by a mili-
tary psychiatrist). For each outcome, individuals were fol-
lowedupfromtheconscriptioninterviewuntilthedatethatthey
developed the outcome or were censored at the date of receiv-
inganotherSMIdiagnosis,dateofdeath,dateofmigrationfrom
Sweden, or December 31, 2011, whichever was earliest.
We adjusted for year of conscription, age at conscription,
SES using Statistics Sweden’
s socioeconomic classification (de-
fined as the highest level of employment of either parent when
the individual was aged 15 years as unemployed, worker, white
collar worker, business owner, or missing), paternal age (in 10-
year age ranges), parental SMI diagnosis at any time, IQ score
(grouped as <74, 74-81, 82-89, 90-95, 96-104, 105-110, 111-118,
119-126, or >126), diagnosis of common mental disorder (CMD)
(anxiety or depression diagnosis made by the military psychia-
tristorbeforeconscriptioninterview),andalcoholandillicitdrug
use disorders at conscription. These confounders were chosen

fore,eachoftheeffectestimatesisindependentoftheotherper-
sonality measures and confounders. From this fully adjusted
model, we calculated the proportional reduction in SMI in the
populationifeachpersonalitymeasurewasaverage,ratherthan

The PAF assumes that the association between the personality
trait and SMI is causal. We conducted a sensitivity analysis ex-

conscript interview to remove individuals who were poten-
tiallyexperiencingpersonalitychangesduetoprodromalsymp-
toms before receiving a diagnosis. All analyses were com-
pleted using Stata software (version 14).36
Results
From1974through1997,1 017 691menwithoutpreexistingSMI
attended enlistment interviews that included personality and
IQ assessments. Of these, 570 individuals were excluded be-
cause of preexisting SMI. The distribution of personality traits
is presented in Table 1. Only 3.7% of the cohort had missing
SES or paternal age data. During the follow-up period, 4310
individuals developed bipolar disorder; 784, schizoaffective
disorder; 4823, schizophrenia; and 5013, other nonaffective
psychoses. The rate of incident SMI was 53.36 per 100 000 per-
son-years at risk (95% CI 52.48-54.26 per 100 000 person-
years at risk). None of the regression models violated propor-
tionality assumptions or gave evidence of multicollinearity.
Bipolar Disorder
Associationswithincreasedbipolardisorderwerefoundforlow
(hazardratio[HR],1.67;95%CI1.54-1.82)andhigh(HR,1.12;95%
CI, 1.03-1.22) deviations from average social maturity (Table 2).
Associations with increased rates were also found for low men-
tal energy (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.39-1.65) and low emotional sta-
bility (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.77-2.07) (Table 2). After adjustment
for the other personality measures, year of conscription, age at
conscription,SES,parentalSMI,paternalage,IQscore,CMD,and
alcohol and illicit drug use disorders at conscription, the HR for
bipolar disorder remained elevated for low (HR, 1.12; 95% CI,
1.01-1.25) and high (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.09-1.35) compared with
average social maturity. The association between mental en-
ergyandrateofbipolardisorderwasattenuatedsuchthatmen-
talenergywasnolongerassociatedwithbipolardisorder(Table2
and Figure). Low emotional stability continued to be associ-
atedwithincreasedbipolardisorderrates(HR,1.62;95%CI,1.46-
1.78) (Table 2 and Figure). The multivariable adjusted PAF for
bipolardisorderwas7%(95%CI,4%-11%)forsocialmaturityand
12% (95% CI, 9%-15%) for emotional stability. After excluding
individuals who developed bipolar disorder within 5 years af-
ter their conscription interview, the associations remained
(eTable in the Supplement).
Schizoaffective Disorder
We found a dose-response association for each personality do-
main in unadjusted analysis, such that individuals in the high
category had reduced rates of schizoaffective disorder com-
pared with average, and those with low scores had increased
rates (Table 2). After adjustment, only low emotional control
was associated with increased rates of schizoaffective disor-
der (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.26-1.83) (Table 2 and Figure). This find-
ing is equivalent to a PAF of 11% (95% CI, 5%-17%). The asso-
ciation between emotional stability and schizoaffective
disorder remained after excluding individuals who devel-
oped schizoaffective disorder within 5 years after the person-
ality assessment (eTable in the Supplement).
Schizophrenia
Unadjusted results suggested dose-response effects similar to
thoseforschizoaffectivedisorderbutwitheffectestimatesfur-
therfromunity.Afteradjustment,lowsocialmaturity(HR,1.61;
95% CI, 1.48-1.74), mental energy (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.24-
1.44), and emotional stability (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.40-1.63) were
independently associated with schizophrenia (Table 2 and
Figure). Reduced rates of schizophrenia were found in indi-
viduals with high social maturity (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77-
0.95), mental energy (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76-0.95), and emo-
tional stability (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.71-0.90). If all individuals
scored within the average range, PAFs would be 15% (95% CI,

12%-18%) for social maturity, 9% (95% CI, 6%-11%) for mental
energy, and 14% (95% CI, 11%-16%) for emotional stability. Af-
ter exclusion of individuals who developed schizophrenia
within 5 years after the personality assessment, results re-
mained similar (eTable in the Supplement).
Other Nonaffective Psychosis
The HRs were similar to those for schizophrenia. Again, we
found an inverse gradient with elevated hazards in those with
low social maturity (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.42-1.67), mental en-
ergy (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.15-1.35), and emotional stability (HR,
1.40; 95% CI, 1.30-1.51) (Table 2 and Figure). The PAFs were
13% (95% CI, 10%-16%) for social maturity, 6% (95% CI, 3%-
9%) for mental energy, and 11% (95% CI, 8%-14%) for emo-
tionalstability.Afterexcludingindividualswhodevelopednon-
affective psychosis within 5 years after the assessment, the
association between personality traits and SMI was main-
tained (eTable in the Supplement).
Discussion
Late adolescent social maturity, mental energy, and emo-
tional stability were inversely associated with schizophrenia
and other nonaffective psychotic illnesses in a dose-
dependent fashion after accounting for important confound-
ers.BipolardisorderhadaU-shapedassociationwithsocialma-
turity and was associated with low emotional stability.
Schizoaffective disorder was solely associated with low emo-
tionalstability.Associationsremainedafterexcludingmenwho
became ill within 5 years after their personality assessment,
suggesting that these results are not purely attributable to pro-
dromal changes in personality.
To our knowledge, we have presented the largest popula-
tion-basedlongitudinalstudytoexaminepersonalitytraitsand
risk for subsequent SMI. In keeping with previous research,13-17
wefoundthatindividualswithlowemotionalstability(ie,high
neuroticism) had increased rates of schizophrenia and other
nonaffective psychosis. We believe that this study is the first
to find that neuroticism is associated with increased rates of
bipolar and schizoaffective disorder. Previously, a study found
that premorbid introversion is associated with schizophrenia
and nonaffective psychosis.15 Our measure of social maturity
includes extraversion as a central characteristic, and social ma-
turity was similarly associated with schizophrenia and other
nonaffective psychotic disorders. This study also found that
premorbid extraversion was associated with an increased risk
for subsequent bipolar disorder.15 However, ours is the first to

show that low and high social maturity are associated with bi-
polar disorder. Owing to the way that bipolar disorder diag-
nosis was recorded (using ICD-8, ICD-9, and ICD-10), we were
unable to examine whether differences in social maturity were
linked to polarity of illness or psychotic vs nonpsychotic bi-
polar disorder, which could potentially explain the U-shaped
association. A previous study involving patients with preex-
isting bipolar disorder37 found that extraversion was associ-
ated with mania and introversion with depression. Social ma-
turity and mental energy are likely to capture elements of the
hyperthymictemperament,38whichhasbeenfoundtobecom-
mon in individuals with bipolar disorder and their appar-
ently healthy siblings.39 Therefore, the lack of association be-
tween mental energy and bipolar disorder is of interest.
Schizoaffective disorder appears to be intermediate to bipo-
lar disorder and schizophrenia in terms of associations with
personality measures. We might expect this finding because
of the mix of affective and psychotic symptoms in these pa-
tients.Schizoaffectivedisorderoftenhascross-sectionalsymp-

cause it signals vulnerability to stressors,41 influences cogni-
tive interpretation of events, or reflects subtle changes in ce-
rebral function42,43 or purely because of shared genetic risk for
emotional instability and SMI.2,44 Neuroticism has been found
to be associated with reduced glucose metabolism in several
prefrontal regions (including the dorsal medial prefrontal cor-
tex and inferior and middle frontal gyrus) that are implicated
in mood disorders and schizophrenia.45,46 The PAFs calcu-
lated in this study suggest that, if the association were causal,
modifyingneuroticismsothatallindividualsscoredwithinthe
normal range would reduce the prevalence of each SMI by ap-
proximately 12%. Low emotional stability may be modifiable
with specific forms of psychotherapy47 and serotonergic
drugs48,49 and thus may represent an appropriate target for
interventions.50Addressingneuroticismcouldalsohaveaposi-
tive effect on the duration of untreated psychosis,51 risk for
CMD,52 and physical health outcomes.53,54
Similarly,reducedsocialmaturityandextraversionmayre-
flect an inability to manage stressors leading to increased SMI
rates, or a shared genetic risk for SMI and the personality trait
may be present. However, our results suggest that the associa-
tionmaybespecifictononaffectivepsychosisandthathighand
low social maturity are associated with bipolar disorder. Extra-
version is positively correlated with resting glucose metabo-
lism in the striatum and posterior temporal region, reflecting
highdopaminetransmission.45,55Highlevelsofdopaminetrans-
mission have been related to emotions such as elation, eupho-
ria, and desire,56 symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of ma-
nia. Again, abnormalities in social maturity may be amenable
to psychopharmacologic57 and psychotherapeutic50 interven-
tion to reduce SMI incidence on a population level. Potentially
normalizing social maturity would reduce rates of bipolar dis-
orderby7%,schizophreniaby15%,andothernonaffectivepsy-
chosis by 13%. Cross-diagnostic and quantifiable constructs as-
sociatedwithneuralmetabolismandsharedgeneticriskfactors
for SMI, neuroticism, and extraversion may be useful mea-
sures in the National Institute of Mental Health research do-
main criteria to develop a biologically driven psychiatric clas-
sification system.58
Limitations
Interpretation is hindered by lack of validation of the rating
of psychological traits and an understanding of how social ma-
turity and mental energy map to more contemporary person-
ality concepts. This lack may reduce comparability with other
studies. However, the fact that the entire population of men
received the same assessment allows standardization of scores
and aids interpretation and generalizability. In addition, evi-
dencesuggeststhatsemistructuredinterviewsofthistypehave
high validity and interrater reliability,21 and the interview re-
mains in use.20 We were unable to test the stability of the per-
sonality measures because each individual received assess-
ment only 1 time. However, the interviews focused on
persistent personality traits rather than recent deviations. Evi-
dence suggests that personality traits increase in stability dur-
ing adolescence and remain relatively stable after that.59
Use of hospital records for SMI diagnoses captures only the
most severely unwell individuals. Outcome misclassification
in schizophrenia is unlikely because more than 90% of indi-
viduals with the diagnosis will be admitted to the hospital at
some point during their illness.60 However, individuals with
bipolar disorder may be less representative of all cases in the
population because hospitalization is likely to be more vari-
able. If this misclassification were nondifferential with regard
to each of the personality traits, our results would represent an
underestimate of the true association between personality and
development of SMI. If high levels of social maturity, mental
energy,andemotionalstabilityrepresentimprovedlifeandcop-
ing skills, we could hypothesize that they would differentially
reduce rates of hospitalization; however, we did not see this
in bipolar disorder, and thus selection bias seems to have been
unlikely. Misclassification because of the use of clinical diag-
noses of SMI, rather than operationally defined research diag-
noses,isalsopossible.Ifthismisclassificationwererandomwith
respect to each of the personality measures, it would tend to
reduce differences among SMI groups. However, differential
misclassification is possible, for example, if individuals with
high social maturity were more likely to receive a diagnosis of
bipolar disorder than schizophrenia because of their appar-
ently high social functioning.
We included all individuals who had complete personal-
ity and IQ tests and excluded 75 647 men who attended inter-
views but had incomplete data. The excuded group had a rate
of SMI (58.37 per 100 000 person-years at risk; 95% CI, 53.78-
62.07 per 100 000 person-years at risk) similar to that of in-
cluded individuals; thus, missingness (ie, the manner in which
data are missing from a sample of the population) does not ap-
pear to be associated with outcome. Until 2000, conscription
was mandatory and only 3% to 5% of Swedish men were ex-
empt from attending because of severe functional or intellec-
tual disability,61 which suggests that this cohort is represen-
tativeofallmeninSweden.Theonlyconfounderswithmissing
data were SES and paternal age, and no evidence suggests that
3.7% missing data would result in biased results from com-
plete case analysis.62
The potential for residual and unmeasured confounding
in our fully adjusted model remains. For instance, we did not
include measures of urban living or educational attainment,
which could be associated with personality and SMI. How-
ever, for these (or any other) covariates to have important ef-
fects on the results presented, they would have to be strongly
associated with the personality measures and with SMI and be
independent of other confounders included in the regression
model.63,64
Conclusions
This study indicates clearly and robustly that low social ma-
turity, mental energy, and emotional stability are associated
with nonaffective psychotic illnesses in general. However, in-
dividuals who developed bipolar disorder had different pat-
terns of these personality traits. Personality dimensions may
thereforebeusefulinunderstandingSMIendophenotypes,and
future research should focus on shared genetic influences on
personality and SMI.
