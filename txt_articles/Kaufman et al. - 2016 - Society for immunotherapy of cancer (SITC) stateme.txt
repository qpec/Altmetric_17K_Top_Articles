Abstract
The Common Rule is a set of ethical principles that provide guidance on the management of human subjects
taking part in biomedical and behavioral research in the United States. The elements of the Common Rule were
initially developed in 1981 following a revision of the Declaration of Helsinki in 1975. Most academic facilities follow
the Common Rule in the regulation of clinical trials research. Recently, the government has suggested a revision of
the Common Rule to include more contemporary and streamlined oversight of clinical research. In this
commentary, the leadership of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) provides their opinion on this plan.
While the Society recognizes the considerable contribution of clinical research in supporting progress in tumor
immunotherapy and supports the need for revisions to the Common Rule, there is also some concern over certain
elements which may restrict access to biospecimens and clinical data at a time when high throughput
technologies, computational biology and assay standardization is allowing major advances in understanding cancer
biology and providing potential predictive biomarkers of immunotherapy response. The Society values its
professional commitment to patients for improving clinical outcomes with tumor immunotherapy and supports
continued discussion with all stakeholders before implementing changes to the Common Rule in order to ensure
maximal patient protections while promoting continued clinical research at this historic time in cancer research.
There has been considerable progress in the develop-
ment of immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer
over the last decade. This has been possible because of
advances in our understanding of the basic mechanisms
that govern tumor immunity and T cell regulation, com-
mitment from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology in-
dustry to drug development in immunotherapy, and the
coordinated completion of well-designed clinical trials
[1, 2]. The importance of immunotherapy is highlighted
by the occurrence of durable response rates in some pa-
tients and evidence that immunotherapy may have thera-
peutic activity in a large number of cancers. Furthermore,
emerging data in melanoma support a role for combin-
ation immunotherapy as potentially more effective than
monotherapy [3]. Future priorities include understanding
mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy and identifi-
cation of predictive biomarkers that will help select appro-
priate patients for treatment and allow more efficient
clinical monitoring of anti-tumor responses in patients on
specific regimens.
A major reason for the success of immunotherapy in
changing the treatment paradigm for cancer has been the
participation of cancer patients in clinical trials. As experts
in the field, we have a responsibility to ensure that patients
are provided with appropriate information to make a truly
informed decision about clinical trial participation. This
process is complex because of the often challenging pro-
spect of balancing potential (or even unknown) benefit,
availability of alternative treatment options, and the possi-
bility of experiencing adverse events, or more succinctly
stated: the need to balance the hope and the reality.

 The informed consent process allows patients, or their
responsible proxy, to provide voluntary agreement to
participate in a clinical study after being informed of the
study purpose, the experimental drugs or procedures in-
volved, the therapeutic alternatives, the potential for per-
sonal or societal benefit, the potential type and intensity
of risks (including lack of response and adverse events)
and information on sponsors and healthcare provider
conflict of interest. The essential criteria of informed
consent have been well described and require that po-
tential study subjects have knowledge and comprehend
the proposed study, that their consent is given freely
without undue influence and that patients can withdraw
consent at any time [4–6]. The many ethical issues asso-
ciated with informed consent were summarized in the
Belmont Report, which was developed after a conference
at the Smithsonian Institution’s Belmont Conference
Center in 1976, with additions from the National Com-
mission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Bio-
medical and Behavioral Research in 1979 and the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration in 1981 [7]. The Belmont
Report provides guidelines for the ethical conduct of
clinical research and considers the individual rights of
patients to make informed decisions and considers
respect for persons, beneficence and justice. These prin-
ciples recognize that patients have the right to act as au-
tonomous decision makers with respect to the treatment
of their disease, special populations may require additional
protections to avoid harm, patients are treated in a fair
and equitable manner while entering into a treatment
strategy that may have limited or unknown effects and
that the selection of subjects and their clinical manage-
ment be fair and balanced without coercion.
In order to ensure the principles set forth in the
Belmont Report are followed in clinical research, the fed-
eral government in 1991 adopted the so-called Common
Rule. The Common Rule is a federal policy that outlines
how human subjects will be protected when electing par-
ticipation in a clinical trial. The Common Rule requires
compliance with contemporary ethical guidelines by re-
search institutions, provides regulations for local Institu-
tion Review Board (IRB) review of clinical studies, and
mandates the collection and documentation of informed
consent [4]. While the Common Rule has provided guid-
ance on how to conduct responsible clinical research for
the last 25 years, there is currently interest in modifying
the Common Rule in order to better protect research sub-
jects and help promote public trust relating to the in-
formed consent process [8].
Tumor immunotherapy may be one of the best exam-
ples of why the Common Rule should be amended.
Some of the recent regulatory approvals of immunother-
apy agents were based on data sets from early phase
clinical trials [9–11]. This likely relates to improved
understanding of tumor immunity and improved ration-
ale for drugs entering the clinic, as well as recognition of
areas of unmet clinical need. Thus, the likelihood of dir-
ect clinical benefit to a patient is higher today than it
was 25 years ago. Further, there are now better guide-
lines in place for the management of immune-related
adverse events. This has significantly shifted the benefit/
risk ratio for participating in clinical research studies in
the modern era. This shift needs to be fairly communi-
cated to potential study subjects and the demonstration
of benefit in cancers not traditionally characterized as
“immunogenic” suggests that there may be a greater
benefit to society for rapidly conducting and completing
tumor immunotherapy research studies. While these de-
velopments are exciting, it is also important to maintain
a fair and balanced perspective for potential human sub-
jects while avoiding over-emphasizing any individual
drug or therapeutic regimen.
The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) is
the primary member-driven professional organization
dedicated to improving outcomes for cancer patients
through the implementation of immunotherapy. Many
of our members are actively engaged in pre-clinical and
clinical investigation of cancer immunotherapy and par-
ticipate in the informed consent process. As a profes-
sional Society, we applaud the review of the Common
Rule at this pivotal stage in the history of cancer re-
search, and agree with many of the proposed changes.
The changes that promote shorter documents with at-
tention to the most meaningful information will help pa-
tients
without
medical
backgrounds
more
easily
understand and make decisions regarding clinical trials.
We also support exclusion from the Common Rule of
proposals that are not deemed to be research or that
have limited risks to human subjects, which will allow
less rigorous review by already overburdened IRBs and
will speed the pace of scientific discovery. The ability to
use a single IRB for cooperative group trials and changes
to the continuing review process where subject harm is
no longer possible, are also reasonable changes.
There are, however, some recommendations that are
of particular concern to our community. Restrictions on
the collection and testing of biomarkers may signifi-
cantly hamper critical research in the field at a time
when we are beginning to identify putative predictive
biomarkers of immunotherapy response and resistance.
The inclusion of high priority tumor, peripheral blood
and bone marrow biopsies to investigate correlative end-
points in current immunotherapy studies have been crit-
ical in identifying underlying mechanisms of response
and providing new biomarkers for validation [12]. This
is well exemplified by the finding that intratumoral
expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-
L1) may identify patients with certain types of cancers

 who are more likely to respond to monoclonal anti-
bodies that block the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. There are
two FDA-approved diagnostics for PD-L1 immunohis-
tochemistry
testing
to
guide
therapeutic
decision-
making for patients with non-small cell lung cancer
or melanoma who are candidates to receive anti-PD-1
therapies [13]. In addition, the FDA also very recently
approved the use of the Ventana PD-L1 assay to the
atezolizumab approved for use in advanced metastatic
urothelial cancer (http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/News-
room/PressAnnouncements/ucm501762.htm).
More progress with biomarkers of response are cru-
cial, given the cost of immunotherapeutic agents and
need to personalize and match likelihood of clinical
benefit with the appropriate treatment. For example, the
demonstration that PD-L1 expression may improve the
likelihood of successful immunotherapy has provided
insight into using other agents that may increase PD-L1
expression as a method to improve PD-1 blockade and
is an active area of current investigation. Limited access
to biospecimens that may otherwise be discarded or
placed in storage seems counterproductive to the re-
search mission. Most importantly, the mission of per-
sonalized medicine, the aim of which is to treat each
patient with the drugs he or she is most likely to re-
spond to, sparing unnecessary side effects and reducing
cost, requires by definition access to biospecimens. At a
time when technologies are rapidly evolving and consid-
erable information can be learned from even small sam-
ples, it is unadvisable to perform a clinical trial without
collecting the samples that will allow the investigators to
understand why patients respond or do not respond, a
necessary
step
for
making
progress
in
improving
treatments.
SITC values its responsibility to patients, and society
at large, to help foster the ethical conduct of clinical re-
search in order to improve the lives of patients with can-
cer. We believe that continued research is essential to this
process and must be conducted with appropriate regula-
tory oversight, institutional compliance and with respect
for individual patients. While we welcome the timely re-
view of the Common Rule and welcome a more compre-
hensive discussion with all stakeholders, we caution the
sponsors of the proposed changes to carefully consider
those measures that may inhibit investigation of correla-
tive aspects of contemporary clinical trials through in-
creased restrictions on access to biospecimens. The
decision to donate such materials should remain with a
well-informed, individual patient while recognizing that
there may be real benefits to both patient and society. The
ability to decline such participation should also remain
with the donor. The progress of the past decade has been
enormous and has been well served by informed interac-
tions between medical experts, regulatory agencies and
individual cancer patients. Continued dialogue should en-
hance clinical investigation allowing even further progress
in the common goal of elimination the burden of cancer
for patients and humankind.
