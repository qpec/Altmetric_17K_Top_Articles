Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy in acute 
coronary syndrome
Simon John Wilson,1 David E Newby,1 Dana Dawson,6 John Irving,2 Colin Berry3
ABSTRACT
Despite a large volume of evidence supporting the 
use of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with acute 
coronary syndrome, there remains major uncertainty 
regarding the optimal duration of therapy. Clinical trials 
have varied markedly in the duration of therapy, both 
across and within trials. Recent systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses suggest that shorter durations of dual 
antiplatelet therapy are superior because the avoidance 
of atherothrombotic events is counterbalanced by the 
greater risks of excess major bleeding with apparent 
increases in all-cause mortality with longer durations. 
These findings did not show significant heterogeneity 
according to whether patients had stable or unstable 
coronary heart disease. Moreover, the potential hazards 
and benefits may differ when applied to the general 
broad population of patients encountered in everyday 
clinical practice who have markedly higher bleeding and 
atherothrombotic event rates. Clinicians lack definitive 
information regarding the duration of therapy in 
patients with acute coronary syndrome and risk scores 
do not appear to be sufficiently robust to address these 
concerns. We believe that there is a pressing need 
to undertake a broad inclusive safety trial of shorter 
durations of therapy in real world populations of patients 
with acute coronary syndrome. The clinical evidence 
would further inform future research into strategies for 
personalised medicine.
InTRoDuCTIon
A ruptured or eroded coronary atherosclerotic 
plaque is the principal underlying cause of an acute 
coronary syndrome. The greatest ‘at risk’ period 
is during this early phase of plaque instability and 
healing, with recurrent event rates peaking in the 
first month. By 3 months, the plaque has usually 
stabilised, healed and subsequent event rates return 
to the background rates seen in patients with stable 
coronary heart disease.1–3 Indeed, beyond 3 months, 
recurrent events commonly occur on plaques at 
other sites within the coronary circulation.3 From 
first principles, the first 3 months is the most critical 
time for interventions to reduce recurrent cardio-
vascular events after an acute coronary syndrome 
(ACS). This is consistent with event rates seen in 
all clinical trials of patients with acute coronary 
syndrome: an initial time-varying high event rate 
that reverts to a consistent linear lower event rate 
from 3 months onwards (table 1).1 2 4 5
Antiplatelet therapy
In an acute coronary syndrome, thrombus forma-
tion occurs under conditions of high shear stress 
and is principally driven by platelet aggregation 
(figure 1). This dominance of platelet aggregation 
during intracoronary thrombus formation reflects 
the dramatic effects that antiplatelet therapies have 
on clinical outcomes (table 2). Aspirin was the 
first antiplatelet therapy which induced a halving 
in event rates in patients with acute coronary 
syndrome:6 7 such a large effect size has rarely been 
surpassed in other domains of cardiology.
Given aspirin’s remarkable success, it is perhaps 
unsurprising that adjunctive antiplatelet therapies 
have been investigated to build on these bene-
fits, especially as there are multiple mechanisms 
of platelet activation beyond the cyclo-oxygenase 
pathway (figure 2). However, as platelets are 
essential to primary haemostasis, there is a balance 
between reducing the incidence of future cardiovas-
cular events and causing harm from an increased 
risk of bleeding. The P2Y12 receptor antagonists 
are a class of drugs that have gained widespread 
acceptance since they appear to provide additional 
thrombotic protection at the expense of modest 
increases in bleeding. Their use is principally asso-
ciated with reductions in recurrent myocardial 
infarction1 4 5 8 and in a few trials, reductions in 
cardiovascular events and mortality.5 8 Other anti-
platelet therapies (figure 2) are available but have 
variable net clinical benefit and for the purposes of 
this review, we will consider only dual antiplatelet 
therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and P2Y12 receptor 
antagonism.
Dual antiplatelet therapy
The benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy following 
an acute coronary syndrome was established by the 
CURE,1 COMMIT/CCS-28 and CLARITY-TIMI 
289 trials. Combined aspirin and clopidogrel 
therapy reduced the 1-year incidence of cardiovas-
cular events by approximately 20% compared with 
aspirin alone. More potent and consistent P2Y12 
receptor inhibition with either prasugrel or tica-
grelor was superior to clopidogrel in the subsequent 
TRITON4 and PLATO5 trials.
The evidence for dual antiplatelet therapy in 
patients with stable coronary heart disease is less 
distinct. In the CHARISMA trial,2 the addition of 
clopidogrel to aspirin in patients with established 
cardiovascular disease or at high risk of clinical 
atherosclerotic disease did not reduce cardiovas-
cular events and was associated with an increase 
in severe bleeding. There was, however, a sugges-
tion of improved outcomes in patients with 
established atherothrombotic disease, particularly 
those with a history of myocardial infarction. The 
PEGASUS-TIMI 5410 trial compared aspirin mono-
therapy to a combination of aspirin and ticagrelor 
in patients with a previous myocardial infarction 
and at least one additional high-risk factor. At a

Review
mean of 33 months, ticagrelor (60 
mg) reduced the incidence 
of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke (7.77% 
vs 9.04%) at the expense of increased thrombolysis in myocar-
dial infarction (TIMI) major bleeding (2.30% vs 1.06%) and a 
neutral effect on overall mortality. On the basis of these trials, 
combination antiplatelet therapy would appear to confer only 
a small ischaemic benefit at the cost of a significant bleeding 
risk. European11 and North American12 guidelines therefore do 
not recommend dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with stable 
atherothrombotic disease but acknowledge that with careful 
consideration, combined antiplatelet therapy may be beneficial 
in some high-risk patients.
Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy: clinical trials
Current European13 and North American12 guidelines advise 
continuing dual antiplatelet therapy for 1 year following an acute 
coronary syndrome. These recommendations are made on the 
basis of early studies4 5 14 15 demonstrating a sustained increased 
risk of thrombotic complications, including stent thrombosis and 
spontaneous cardiovascular events, beyond 6 months. However, 
the greatest absolute reductions in cardiovascular events with 
dual antiplatelet therapy are seen in the first 3 months (table 1) 
and since these studies, advances in drug-eluting stent technology 
have led to a substantially reduced incidence of late (>30 
days) 
and very late (>1 year) stent thrombosis.16
In recent trials of patients treated with newer generation 
drug-eluting stents, shorter durations of dual antiplatelet 
therapy (3 months to 6 months) were non-inferior to 1217–22 
months or 2423 months of treatment with regard to etiher a 
composite of cardiovascular events or cardiovascular events 
plus major bleeding. Moreover, all of these trials included 
patients with an acute coronary syndrome (range 23% to 74% 
of study population) and in those who undertook prespeci-
fied subgroup analyses, no heterogeneity in treatment effect 
between stable and unstable coronary artery disease was 
observed (figure 3).
Beyond 12 months, there remains a residual risk of local 
and systemic atherothrombotic complications24 and a number 
of studies have examined whether extended dual antiplatelet 
therapy 
(>12 
months) 
following 
percutaneous 
coronary 
intervention may be beneficial. In the DES-LATE25 and 
ARCTIC-INTERRUPTION trials,26 prolonged treatment with 
dual antiplatelet therapy (18–30 months vs 12 months) neither 
reduced the incidence of cardiovascular events nor increased the 
risk of major bleeding. Among those patients presenting with 
an acute coronary syndrome, primary and secondary ischaemic 
end points did not differ from the global treatment population. 
In the DAPT trial,27 the largest and only double-blinded study, 
extended dual antiplatelet therapy (30 months vs 12 months) 
reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebro-
vascular events (4.3% vs 5.9%), myocardial infarction (2.1% 
vs 4.1%) and stent thrombosis (0.4% vs 1.4%) but at a cost of 
increased moderate or severe bleeding (2.5% vs 1.6%) and a 
borderline rise in all-cause mortality (2.0% vs 1.0%; p=0.05). 
Treatment effect did not differ between patients with or without 
a history of myocardial infarction for any of the co-primary end 
points including bleeding (figure 3).

Review
Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy: systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses
Meta-analyses of trials using dual antiplatelet therapy in patients 
receiving intracoronary stents have compared short (3–6 
months), 12-month and prolonged (>12 
months) durations of 
therapy.28 29 Longer treatment periods reduced the incidence 
of myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis but at a cost of 
increased major bleeding and with a tendency to increase overall 
mortality because of an increase in non-cardiovascular death. 
However, the majority of patients included in these analyses had 
stable coronary artery disease and few patients with acute coro-
nary syndrome were treated with ≤6 
months of dual antiplatelet 
therapy. In a recent meta-analysis30 that included only patients 
with a history of acute coronary syndrome, prolonged dual 
antiplatelet therapy reduced the risk of cardiovascular death 
(RR 0.85; 95% 
CI: 0.74 to 0.98, p=0.03) without an increase 
in non-cardiovascular death (RR 1.03, 95% 
CI 0.86 to 1.23; 
p=0.76) or all-cause mortality (RR 0.92, 95% 
CI 0.83 to 1.03).
Atherothrombotic risk
The optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy is dependent on 
the balance between preventing future atherothrombotic events 
and the increased risk of bleeding from continued treatment. 
Following an acute coronary syndrome, predictors of athero-
thrombotic risk include ST deviation, diabetes mellitus, smoking 
status, left ventricular ejection fraction, stent type, number of 
stents and complexity of coronary artery disease. Subgroup anal-
yses have attempted to identify if any of these factors influence 
outcomes with regard to duration of dual antiplatelet treatment.
In the EXCELLENT trial,22 there was a threefold increase in 
the incidence of cardiovascular events (p<0.001 for interaction) 
among pat
ients with diabetes mellitus treated with 6 months 
as compared with 12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy. In the 
ISAR-SAFE trial,20 rates of death, myocardial infarction, stent 
thrombosis, stroke or TIMI major bleeding tended to be higher 
in patients aged <67 
years and lower in patients aged ≥67 
years 
with 6 months compared with 12 months of dual antiplatelet 
treatment (p=0.03). These differences were driven by ischaemic 
complications rather than bleeding events. In the DAPT trial, 
men were nearly five times less likely to suffer from stent throm-
bosis if dual antiplatelet therapy was extended beyond 12 months 
(p=0.04) and the reduction in major adverse cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular events with prolonged therapy (30 months) was 
greater in those treated with prasugrel (vs clopidogrel; p=0.03)

or a first-generation drug-eluting stent (p=0.048). Similar 
trends were observed in DES-LATE25 and ARCTIC-INTERRUP-
TION.26
Audit of the British Cardiovascular Society Intervention 
database indicates that in 2013/2014, a half of all percuta-
neous coronary intervention procedures were associated with 
residual disease (≥1 stenosis of >50% severity), fulfilling the 
criteria for incomplete revascularisation. Patients with acute 
coronary syndrome and incomplete revascularisation have a 
residual burden of coronary disease that is a substrate for recur-
rent plaque rupture, coronary thrombosis and future cardiac 
events.31 32 Prolonged dual antiplatelet treatment may mitigate 
this risk but whether this translates to a more favourable risk-
to-benefit balance for patients with incomplete revascularisation 
remains an area for future research.
Bleeding and total mortality
Large registries and trials have shown that major bleeding is 
associated with an increase in mortality that could potentially 
negate the benefits of dual antiplatelet therapy in acute coro-
nary syndrome.33–36 Importantly, these bleeding risks are not 
confined to the initial hospitalisation phase.33 35 The association 
between bleeding and mortality has been a consistent feature 
of acute coronary syndrome trials irrespective of whether the 
intervention being assessed and improvements in outcome are 
seen with interventions that are associated with a lower bleeding 
risk. For example, in the OASIS-5 trial,33 fondaparinux had 
similar antithrombotic benefits to enoxaparin but was associated 
with lower rates of major bleeding and marked reductions in 
all-cause mortality. Similar benefits have also been reported for 
randomised controlled trials of arterial access sites in patients 
treated with an invasive strategy for either ST-segment37 or 
non-ST-segment38 myocardial infarction. Again, because radial 
artery access was associated with less bleeding, overall all-cause 
mortality was lower.37 38 There have been various mechanisms 
proposed for the link between bleeding and mortality that 
include rebound hypercoagulability, discontinuation of anti-
thrombotic treatments, inflammation and ischaemia.39 The 
European Society of Cardiology Working Group on Thrombosis 
has called for clinical trials to address bleeding in acute coronary 
syndrome including the exploration of the duration of dual anti-
platelet therapy.39
Duration uncertainty
Currently there are variations in local and regional dual anti-
platelet therapy practices that are confusing for patients, primary 
care physicians and cardiologists. Indeed, while European13 
and North American12 guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet 
therapy for 12 months after an acute coronary syndrome, both 
acknowledge that shorter or longer durations may be appro-
priate. Duration of therapy is seen as a major priority for future 
research by numerous national and international guideline 
committees as well as having considerable financial implications, 
especially for the latest generation of P2Y12 receptor antagonists.

Review
However, major pharmaceutical companies have to date not 
funded trials comparing shorter (<12 
months) durations of 
dual antiplatelet therapy, since, arguably, it may not be in their 
commercial interest to do so.
For clinicians and healthcare providers, there remains much 
uncertainty regarding the default duration of dual antiplatelet 
therapy for most patients with acute coronary syndrome. Current 
guidelines are largely based on evidence that predates potentially 
important technological advances, including second-generation 
drug-eluting stents, while in recent trials, only a minority of 
patients presented with an acute coronary syndrome and many 
of these studies were underpowered to detect differences due 
to low event rates. Selected populations included in randomised 
controlled trials have lower rates of bleeding and non-cardiovas-
cular death than the general population (table 3), since patients 
with any history of bleeding or major comorbidity were specif-
ically excluded from such trials. On the other hand, shorter 
durations of dual antiplatelet therapy may expose medically 
managed patients (such as due to complex disease) to an increased 
risk of atherothrombotic events. This is because stenting in acute 
coronary syndrome confers protection against atherothrombotic 
events40 41 and in the vast majority of clinical trials, only patients 
who underwent stent implantation were included. There is 
therefore a major concern that the evidence to date has been 
extrapolated to a broader population with a higher risk of both 
atherothrombotic events and adverse outcomes from bleeding. 
Accordingly, this has left uncertainty as to the relative benefits 
and risks of one period of treatment versus another in real-world 
patients with acute coronary syndrome.
Increased thrombin generation42 and platelet reactivity43 have 
been demonstrated for up to 2 years following a plaque rupture 
myocardial infarction. This may explain potentially more 
favourable outcomes with longer durations of dual antiplatelet 
therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome as compared 
to those with stable ischaemic heart disease undergoing percu-
taneous coronary intervention. However, switching from dual 
antiplatelet treatment to monotherapy (usually aspirin alone) 
is associated with a rebound prothrombotic effect, especially 
with regard to an excess of stent thrombosis.10 27 In the DAPT 
trial,27 this phenomenon occurred irrespective of the timing 
of switching to monotherapy. Thus, unless dual antiplatelet 
therapy is continued indefinitely, there will remain a small

Review
persistent short-term 3-month risk of rebound stent thrombosis 
and myocardial infarction following the transition from dual to 
single antiplatelet therapy.
Newer generation P2Y12 inhibitors provide more effective 
antithrombotic protection than clopidogrel but at the cost of 
increased bleeding. Given the greater expense of these agents 
and the marked temporal decline in thrombotic risk that is 
evident over the first few months, an early ‘switch’ from tica-
grelor or prasugrel to clopidogrel after 1 month to 6 months 
has been advocated. While evidence from small cohort44 and 
pharmacodynamic studies45 suggest such an approach may be 
safe and reduce bleeding events, an overall lack of data limits 
any meaningful recommendations. TROPICAL-ACS (NCT 
01959451) is an ongoing clinical trial investigating whether 
a switch to clopidogrel treatment after 1 week of prasugrel is 
non-inferior to 12 months of standard treatment with prasugrel. 
Results from this and other similar randomised studies (SWAP-4, 
NCT 02287909) should provide insights into defining the best 
strategy for switching between P2Y12 antagonists.
Personalised medicine
Generic recommendations for length of dual antiplatelet therapy 
derived from a protocolised intervention in clinical trials will 
inevitably expose some patients to an excessive duration of treat-
ment and disadvantage other patients by withdrawing therapy 
that protects them from myocardial infarction. The critical clin-
ical question is therefore: can individuals who are more or less 
likely to benefit from shorter or longer durations of treatment be 
identified? While several risk tools have been developed to help 
determine the future incidence of coronary thrombotic events 
and major bleeding episodes for an individual, the DAPT Score46 
and PARIS registry risk Score47 were specifically designed to 
predict medium-term to long-term risks that are directly modi-
fied by continuing or interrupting dual antiplatelet therapy.
Using data from the DAPT trial, the DAPT Score was developed 
to determine the net clinical benefit of extending dual antiplatelet 
therapy from 12 months to 30 months (figure 4). Thirty-seven 
candidate variables were considered with 8 included in the final 
model. In the validation cohort the c-statistic was 0.64 for isch-
aemia and 0.64 for bleeding. The PARIS registry risk score was 
similarly developed but was based on prospective observational 
data. Model discrimination for ischaemia (c-statistic 0.65) and 
bleeding (c-statistic 0.64) events were comparable to the DAPT 
score. Thus while these and other similar risk / benefit tools 
may provide a step forward, they do not as yet offer sufficiently 
robust predictive value for everyday clinical use.
Variables included in risk tools tend to predict both bleeding 
and myocardial infarction. High platelet reactivity was originally 
reported to identify patients at an increased risk of future athero-
thrombotic events.48 However, subsequent studies have failed 
to show an association between platelet reactivity and athero-
thrombotic outcomes49 or demonstrate that dose adjustment 
on the basis of on-treatment platelet reactivity is beneficial.50 
Routine platelet testing is therefore not recommended in patients 
prescribed P2Y12 inhibitors and is unlikely to deliver a clinically 
useful prediction score. Further research is needed to define 
Figure 4 DAPT Score calculator for predicting risk/benefit of extending dual antiplatelet therapy from 12 months to 30 months.Available at www.

Review
prediction tools with high discriminatory value in real-world 
patients, and the potential for net-clinical benefit according to 
the length of dual anti-platelet therapy.
ConCLuSIonS
It has been 15 years since the CURE trial demonstrated the 
benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy following an acute coronary 
syndrome and yet the optimal duration remains uncertain. With 
regard to thrombotic complications, recent clinical trials and 
meta-analyses suggest that with newer generation drug-eluting 
stents, 3 months to 6 months of dual antiplatelet therapy is 
non-inferior to 12 months of treatment. Prolonged treatment 
(>12 
months) reduces the risk of stent thrombosis, myocardial 
infarction and possibly cardiovascular death but at the cost of 
increased major bleeding and with no net mortality benefit. 
However, these potential hazards and benefits of intervention 
may differ when applied to the general broad population of 
patients encountered in everyday clinical practice who have 
higher bleeding and atherothrombotic event rates.
While ongoing randomised clinical trials may address some of 
the residual uncertainties in select subgroups, we believe there 
is a pressing need to undertake a broad inclusive trial of shorter 
durations of therapy in broad populations of patients with acute 
coronary syndrome. Such a trial will need to be able to explore 
specific subgroups, such as those who are medically managed, 
undergo percutaneous coronary intervention or have coronary 
artery bypass graft surgery, as well as enable better identifica-
tion of atherothrombotic and bleeding risks from real world data 
to inform a more personalised approach to decisions regarding 
treatment duration.
