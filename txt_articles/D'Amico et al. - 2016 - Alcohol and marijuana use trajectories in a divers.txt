Abstract
Aims—We tested race/ethnic differences in alcohol and marijuana (AM) trajectories (comprising 
an intercept term; reflecting overall probability of use, and a slope term; reflecting change in 
probability of use) during adolescence, whether AM use trajectories predicted high school 
outcomes, and whether outcomes differed by race/ethnicity after controlling for trajectory of AM 
use.
Design—This longitudinal study involved n=6,509 youth from 16 middle schools in Southern 
California surveyed from age 11.5 (2008) to age 17 (2015); all surveys assessed AM use, and the 
final survey also examined high school outcomes.
Setting—Youth completed five surveys in middle school and two online surveys in high school.
Participants—The sample was 50% male and 80% non-White.
Measurements—Intercept (at 2.75 years post baseline) and slope of AM use were examined as 
outcomes for race/ethnic differences. AM use trajectories were examined as predictors of 
academic performance and unpreparedness, social functioning, mental and physical health, and 
delinquency.
Findings—We found differences in trajectories of use by race/ethnicity with white youth 
reporting a higher overall intercept of alcohol use compared to all other groups (v. Asian p<.001, 
Black p=.001, Multi-ethnic p=.008). Overall, examination of trajectories of use showed that 
adolescents with a higher alcohol use intercept term reported greater academic unpreparedness 
(p<.001) and delinquency (p<.001) at wave 7 in high school. In addition, youth with a higher 
intercept for marijuana use reported greater academic unpreparedness (p<.001) and delinquency 
(p<.001), and poorer academic performance (p=.032) and mental health (p=.002) in high school. 
At wave 7, compared to White youth, Hispanic and multi-ethnic youth reported poorer academic 
performance (p<.001 and p=0.034, respectively); Asian, Black, and Hispanic youth reported

 higher academic unpreparedness (p<.001, p=.019, and p=.001); and Asian youth and multi-ethnic 
youth reported poorer physical health (p=.012 and p=.018) controlling for AM use.
Conclusions—Greater AM use was associated with worse functioning in high school for all 
youth. After controlling for AM use, non-White youth reported worse outcomes in high school for 
academics and health.
Keywords

The period from middle school to high school is associated with important developmental 
changes that occur physically, socially and mentally (1–3). Initiation of alcohol and/or 
marijuana (AM) during this time period can significantly affect functioning, especially if 
youth initiate at a younger age. For example, AM use during this time period is associated 
with academic problems, poorer mental health, use of other illicit drugs in the future 
(including heroin and cocaine), and a higher likelihood of abuse or dependence in adulthood 
(4–6). Furthermore, given that the brain is still developing, adolescents can still have 
memory, attention, and reaction time deficits even after they stop using compared to youth 
who have never used AM (7, 8).
Studies in the United States examining trajectories of alcohol use during adolescence have 
shown a consistent pattern. Initiation typically occurs in early adolescence (roughly ages 11–
15), with drinking rates increasing steadily during mid- and late adolescence before peaking 
in early young adulthood (9). Marijuana use trajectories follow a similar pattern, albeit with 
a later average age of initiation (i.e., 17). However, not all individuals follow this general 
pattern; thus research has focused on identifying distinct developmental trajectories of AM 
use. Most of these studies identify a group of persistent or high users, a declining group 
where use starts off heavy and gradually declines over time, an increasing group where use 
gradually escalates over time, and a moderate/infrequent group that uses occasionally over 
time (9–14). Persistent or high AM users typically have the worst outcomes (15–19). For 
example, youth in high marijuana use groups during high school also reported higher rates 
of both mental health and drug problems at age 21 (20); membership in higher alcohol use 
groups in 6th grade was associated with greater use of other substances and violent behavior 
in 8th grade (21); youth in the heaviest drinking trajectory group at age 18 had more 
problems with verbal memory and monitoring two years later (22); and youth who initiated 
alcohol and cigarettes concurrently early on reported worse physical health, a higher 
likelihood of selling drugs and the highest rates of self-reported problems compared to 
groups that did not initiate use in early adolescence (23).
Few studies have examined trajectories of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use among diverse 
ethnic and racial samples across middle school and high school (9, 11, 24). However, the 
face of the United States is changing. During the next 15 years, Asian American, Hispanic 
American, African American, and Native American populations are expected to rapidly 
grow in size, with each of these cultures subsequently comprising a significant proportion of 
the nation (17, 25). In addition, multi-racial Americans are the fastest growing population 
under age 18 (26). Research has shown that non-Whites often have worse health outcomes

 (11, 27, 28) and more interpersonal problems and other negative outcomes from AOD use 
(8, 29–31) compared to Whites, even with less AOD use. To date, there are no studies that 
longitudinally address when these disparities may start; for example, whether we may see 
disparities in functioning due to AOD use begin as early as adolescence. It is imperative that 
we assess when disparities in functioning may begin to occur and in what domains so that 
clinicians and providers can better determine the best time and way to intervene.
A small body of research has assessed racial/ethnic differences in AOD use; however, 
studies typically focus on one substance and do not address potential disparities in 
outcomes. Results indicate that Whites and Hispanics are more likely than Blacks and 
Asians to drink alcohol (32, 33), smoke cigarettes (34–36), and use marijuana (37, 38). Four 
recent studies have examined racial/ethnic differences in more than one substance across 
adolescence into adulthood (2, 39, 40). They all used data from the National Longitudinal 
Study of Adolescents and Adults (Add Health) to examine use of cigarettes, alcohol, and 
marijuana. Although these studies examined use from adolescence to adulthood, they only 
had four waves of data that were spaced over a 14 year period. Setoh and colleagues (2) 
examined differences between Whites and Hispanics; Keyes et al. (40) compared Whites and 
Blacks; Chen and Jacobson (41) compared Whites, Blacks, Hispanics and Asians; and 
Evans-Polce et al. (39) examined differences between Whites, Hispanics and Blacks. Three 
studies found that White youth had higher rates of AOD use initially and increased their use 
more rapidly over time than non-White youth; however, racial/ethnic differences lessened as 
youth aged indicating that non-White youth “caught up” in their 20’s and 30’s. Chen and 
Jacobson (41) found that Hispanics had the highest rate of use for all substances at age 12, 
with Whites increasing the most rapidly, and peak levels of use for Blacks occurring at later 
ages.
These studies have significantly advanced our knowledge in this area; however, several gaps 
need to be addressed. First, few longitudinal studies examine trajectories for more than one 
substance. Given that AM are the two substances initiated and used most frequently during 
adolescence, it is important to examine how trajectories of AM use during this time period 
may differentially affect outcomes. Second, none of these studies measure AM use with 
regular assessments during both middle school and high school. These are important 
developmental time periods to measure consistently. More regular assessments allow 
examination across critical transitions, including from age 11 to 14 when use rates increase 
dramatically (42, 43), and from 14 to 17 when youth begin to gain more independence from 
parents and may have more opportunities to engage in risk behaviors (44, 45). Third, studies 
tend to focus on differences between just a few racial/ethnic groups. Longitudinal research 
with diverse groups of youth is needed, including multi-ethnic youth, so we can examine 
how use in middle school and high school may affect functioning in high school. Fourth, 
most studies that examine how trajectories affect outcomes tend to focus on one outcome, 
such as mental health or academic achievement. It is important to assess several different 
domains, such as academics, physical and mental health, social functioning, and behavior as 
findings could shed light on what domains may be most affected during this important 
developmental period, which could help inform prevention efforts. Most importantly, these 
studies do not typically address potential disparities in functioning that may occur given the 
same rates of use during this time period. One cross sectional study found that Latino high

 school aged youth who reported drinking also reported a higher likelihood of getting into 
trouble with the police compared to White and Asian youth who drank alcohol (30). The 
current study moves the field forward significantly in this area by a) testing slope and 
intercept differences for AM use by race/ethnicity to determine whether differences exist in 
probability of use and rate of change in probability of use, b) testing whether the intercept 
and slope (average and change) of probability of AM use from age 11 to 16 predict 
outcomes across several key domains of functioning at age 17, and c) adjusting for level of 
AM use and comparing outcomes for White, Black, Hispanic, Asian and multi-ethnic youth 
to understand whether functioning in high school differs for these groups after controlling 
for AM use.
Method
Participants and procedures
This study focuses on two cohorts of youth who were in 6th and 7th grade (age 11–12) in 
2008 and were followed until 2015 (age 17). Participants were part of an AOD use 
prevention program, CHOICE, conducted in 16 middle schools in the greater Los Angeles 
area (46). Schools were initially selected to participate across three districts to obtain a 
diverse sample and to have similar AM use rates at baseline. A total of 14,979 students 
across all 16 schools received parental consent forms; 92% of parents returned this form (n = 
13,785). Approximately 71% of parents gave permission for their child to participate (n = 
9,828) and 94% of consented students completed the first survey (n = 8,932). The study has 
a Certificate of Confidentiality; all procedures were approved by the institution’s review 
board. Youth completed waves 1 through 5 in middle school during PE class (wave 1: fall 
2008, wave 2: spring 2009, wave 3: fall 2009, wave 4: spring 2010, and wave 5: spring 
2011), and follow up rates ranged from 74% to 90%, excluding new youth that could have 
come in at a subsequent wave. Procedures are reported more extensively elsewhere (46). As 
youth graduated from middle school to high school between waves 5 and 6, they transitioned 
from 16 middle schools to over 200 high schools nationally and internationally. The cohort 
was re-contacted and re-consented to complete four annual web-based surveys; we utilize 
the first two waves in the current study as this is what is available at this time. Wave 6 
occurred between May 2013 and April 2014 when participants were in 9th–12th grades. Of 
the 4,366 youth who were eligible for the wave 6 survey (i.e., in 6th–7th grade at wave 1, 
could be located, were re-consented), 2,653 (61%) of those completed the survey. Retention 
from wave 6 to wave 7 was 80%. Drop out was not significantly associated with 
demographics or risk behaviors, such as drinking and marijuana use. The trajectory sample 
of 6,509 youth includes original 6th and 7th graders from wave 1, and youth that completed a 
survey at any other wave from waves 2–7; 77% of youth completed 4 or more survey waves. 
See Table 1 for descriptive statistics and Table 2 for sample information at each wave.
Measures
Demographics at wave 1—Students were asked about their age, race/ethnicity, and 
gender. Students were classified into one of five racial/ethnic groups: non-Hispanic White 
(reference group), non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander, and multi-ethnic 
(indicated more than race)/Other (Native American, Native Hawaiian).

 Alcohol and marijuana use at waves 1–7—Alcohol and marijuana use were assessed 
using well-established measures with adolescents (47, 48). For past month use, we asked: 
“During the past month, how many days did you [drink at least one full drink of alcohol] 
[use marijuana]?” Responses ranged from 1=“0 days” to 8=“20–30 days” and were 
dichotomized (1=“any use” versus 0=“no use”) due to infrequent responses at high levels of 
use.
Academic performance and unpreparedness at wave 7—Academic performance 
was based on three items: self-reported grades in past year (48) (1=mostly F’s to 8=mostly 
A’s), highest level of school they plan to finish (49) (1=I may not finish high school to 6=I 
plan to go to graduate school or professional school), and how much they agree with the 
statement “Getting good grades is important to you” (1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly 
agree). Items were standardized (mean=0; standard deviation=1) to account for a difference 
in item scales and summed (α=0.57), with higher scores indicating stronger academic 
performance. Academic unpreparedness (50) had 4 items that evaluated how often the 
respondent went to class without homework done, without paper and pencil, without books, 
and how often they went to class late (0=never to 3=often). Items were summed with higher 
scores indicating more unpreparedness (α=0.75).
Physical health at wave 7—A physical ailments scale (51) had 4 items from the 
Physical Health Questionnaire-15 on how bothered the respondent had been in the previous 
4 weeks by stomach pain, headaches, feeling tired or having low energy and trouble 
sleeping. Original responses were dichotomized such that 0=not at all bothered and 
1=bothered a little or a lot. Responses were summed with higher scores indicating more 
symptoms (α=0.69). Physical health (52) included 3 items: general health (0=excellent to 
4=poor), physically able to do activities that one enjoys (0=with no trouble to 4=not able to 
do), and could participate in sports/activities similar to their peers (0=with no trouble to 
4=not able to do). Items were reverse scored and summed with higher scores indicating 
better health (α=0.69).
Mental health at wave 7—General mental health status was assessed using the MHI-5 
(53), a subscale of the SF-36; α=.75 (14). Five items reflecting mood in the past 30 days 
were rated on a 6-point scale (1=none of the time to 6=all of the time) and reflected domains 
primarily related to anxiety and depression (e.g., “How much of the time have you been a 
very nervous or anxious person?,” “How much of the time have you felt downhearted or 
blue?”) Items were summed and then, following scoring instructions, items were linearly 
transformed to a 0 to 100 scale such that higher scores indicate better mental health.
Social functioning at wave 7—Respondents rated seven items from the PROMIS Peer 
Relationships Short Form item bank (22) on a 5-point scale (0=never to 4=always). Raw 
scores ranged from 0 to 32. Following PROMIS scoring instructions, we transformed raw 
scores to a t-score (α=.92) with higher scores indicating better social functioning. Sample 
items include: “I was able to count on my friends”, “I felt accepted by other kids my age”, 
and “Other kids wanted to talk to me.”

 Delinquency at wave 7—Eight items (32) rated on a 6-point scale (1=not at all to 6=20 
or more times) and summed (α=.80) assessed how often the respondent engaged in various 
problem behaviors (e.g., school misbehavior, fighting, stealing) in the past year. In 
adolescent populations this measure is associated with AM use and mental health. (54–56)
Statistical Analysis
We used latent growth modeling to examine AM use over time, employing a structural 
equation modeling framework, using Mplus v6.11 (57) as this approach allows us to treat 
change as both an outcome (as in conventional growth models) and a predictor. The intercept 
represents the predicted value of the outcome when the predictor is equal to zero. This was 
set at 2.75 years because waves were not evenly spaced. There were 5.5 total years between 
waves 1 and 7 (wave 1 = 0 years, wave 2 = .5 years, wave 3 = 1 year, wave 4 = 1.5 years, 
wave 5 = 2.5 years, wave 6 = 4.5 years, and wave 7 = 5.5 years); the intercept therefore 
represents the average use; thus we refer to the intercept as the average in later sections. The 
slope represents the change in the probability of use as the individual ages. We used the 
weighted least squares with mean and variance adjusted estimator (WLSMV). This estimator 
(as implemented in Mplus) can provide consistent and unbiased estimates in the presence of 
missing data under some general assumptions, (58) hence we are able to use information for 
all individuals, regardless of the number of surveys they completed. Because of convergence 
problems caused by dissimilar variances, the MHI-5 score was divided by 10. Structural 
equation models are tested for fit to data using the chi-square test, however, this test can be 
overpowered, suggesting statistically significant misfit when discrepancies are negligible; 
hence, we use two additional measures of fit: the comparative fit index (59) (CFI) and the 
root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) (60, 61). Values of RMSEA less than 
0.05 indicate good fit, as do CFI values greater than 0.95.
We first examined race/ethnicity as a predictor of the slope and average (dummy coded, with 
White as the reference, compared to categories of Asian, Black, Hispanic, multi-ethnic/
other; average represented as the intercept); we controlled for age, gender and whether the 
individual attended an intervention school. We estimated separate models for alcohol and 
marijuana. We next examined a sequelae of change model (62). This is a feature possible 
within a structural equation modeling framework in which the random effect of the rate of 
change can function not just as an outcome (as it is conventionally modeled) but also as a 
predictor of downstream outcomes; thus we tested whether the slope and intercept for AM 
were associated with outcomes measured at wave 7. Finally, we examined race/ethnic 
differences in outcomes after controlling for use by estimating a single model with slope and 
intercept of both AM, and estimating the direct effect from race/ethnicity to each outcome.
Results
Predictors of slope and intercept of use
The first models we estimated included the latent growth to examine race/ethnic differences 
in the slope and intercept for alcohol and marijuana using two separate models. The 
intercept represents average probability of use, and slope represents change in probability of 
use over time, both modeled as a logistic function. Overall fit was good; for marijuana, chi-

 square=109, df=63, RMSEA=0.011, CFI=0.982; for alcohol chi-square=161, df=63, 
RMSEA=0.016 and CFI=0.971. Fit statistics indicate that the logistic-linear model of 
change in probability of use was a good description of the data (Table 3).
We found statistically significant effects for race/ethnicity predicting the average probability 
of use (intercept) and the change in the probability of use (slope) (Table 3). The averages of 
Asian teens were lower than White teens for both alcohol and marijuana, meaning that they 
used significantly less AM than Whites. Similarly, Black and multi-ethnic groups had lower 
averages than Whites for alcohol use, but these groups did not differ significantly on 
marijuana averages. For slopes, Hispanic youth had less steep slopes than did Whites for 
both AM, indicating that their rate of increase in the probability of use was less than that of 
White youth.
Effects of use on wave 7 outcomes
We next fit models where the intercepts and slopes of AM predicted outcomes measured at 
wave 71. To avoid collinearity problems, we again fit separate models for alcohol and 
marijuana. Model fit was again very good indicating that the linear logistic model fit the 
data; for marijuana, chi-square=146; df=99, RMSEA=0.009, CFI=0.995; for alcohol, chi-
square=215, df=101, RMSEA=0.013, CFI=0.989. A higher average (intercept) of alcohol 
use was associated with greater academic unpreparedness and delinquency scores (Table 4). 
For marijuana, a higher average was associated with greater academic unpreparedness, lower 
academic performance, poorer mental health and greater delinquency. The slopes for AM 
were also predictive of delinquency (with positive slopes associated with greater 
delinquency), and for alcohol with social functioning (with a positive slope associated with 
higher social functioning scores).
Race/ethnic differences for wave 7 outcomes controlling for use
Finally, we fit a model with AM use, and examined direct effects from race/ethnicity to the 
outcomes, controlling for both the average (intercept) and slope (rate of increase) of 
probability of use. The final model provided a good fit: chi-square=417, df=238, CFI=0.991, 
RMSEA=0.011. Table 5 shows results of this model, with the direct effects from race/
ethnicity to outcomes, controlling for use. Hispanic and multi-ethnic youth reported lower 
academic performance than White youth, and Asian, Black, and Hispanic youth reported 
significantly higher academic unpreparedness than White youth. Asian youth and multi-
ethnic youth also reported significantly poorer physical health than White youth. There were 
no statistically significant differences for delinquency, mental health, physical ailments or 
social functioning.
Discussion
The current study moves the field forward in the area of trajectory research by examining 
how AM use among a diverse sample of youth across this developmental period affects 
functioning for a variety of domains, including physical and mental health, academics, social

 functioning, and behavior. In addition, we assessed whether there were racial/ethnic 
differences in functioning for White, Black, Hispanic, Asian and multi-ethnic youth after 
controlling for level of AM use.
Similar to previous work in this area (38, 63), Asian youth reported less alcohol and 
marijuana use than White youth, and Black and multi-ethnic youth reported less alcohol than 
White youth. Furthermore, the rate of increase in the probability of drinking and marijuana 
use for Whites during adolescence was greater than the rate of increase in the probability for 
Hispanics, which corresponds with recent research on the Add Health data set (2, 39, 40). 
Thus, White youth continue to be at higher risk for substance use during middle school and 
high school.
Marijuana and alcohol use both affected functioning in high school; however, marijuana use 
was associated with poorer functioning across more domains. Specifically, youth who had a 
higher probability of marijuana use also reported lower academic functioning, were less 
prepared for school, engaged in more delinquent behavior and had poorer mental health. In 
addition, delinquent behavior in high school was more likely among youth who showed a 
greater increase in their probability of marijuana use from middle school to high school. 
These findings are important because teen marijuana use is rising across the United States 
(64). In addition, many youth tend to think that alcohol use has more consequences than 
marijuana use and therefore view marijuana use as “safer” than drinking (65), which may be 
due, in part, to changing views of marijuana use that have occurred due to changing 
marijuana policies (66). Prevention efforts must begin to address these changing views by 
educating youth about marijuana’s effects and how although marijuana may help with 
certain ailments, larger clinical trials with more varied groups of patients are needed (40). In 
addition, youth need to understand the potential harms of this drug such as its potential 
effect on their developing brain and how it can affect performance in both adolescence and 
adulthood (67).
Similar to marijuana use, delinquent behavior and academic unpreparedness in high school 
were more likely among youth who showed a greater increase in their probability of alcohol 
use from middle school to high school. These youth also reported higher social functioning 
in high school. Of note, some items on the social functioning measure focused on 
acceptance (other people may age want to be with me; want to talk with me) and popularity 
(I am good at making friends; other people want to be my friend). Alcohol use is often 
driven by social motives (68), and youth who view themselves as more popular tend to 
report heavier drinking (69). This is in contrast to youth who report use of other drugs, such 
as prescription drug use; these youth view themselves as less popular and therefore report 
lower social functioning (56). Thus, it may be that during this time period drinking is 
associated with being more social, and feeling more accepted and popular. Tucker and 
colleagues suggest that more work is needed in this area to gain a clearer understanding of 
why adolescents with a larger number of school-based friendship ties are more likely to 
drink (69).
When we examined functioning in high school by race/ethnicity while controlling for level 
of AM use, we found differences in academic functioning and physical health. Specifically,

 Asian youth and multi-ethnic youth reported more problems with physical health than White 
youth when using at the same level; Asian, Black and Hispanic youth reported being less 
prepared academically, and Hispanic and multi-ethnic youth reported lower academic 
performance compared to White youth. The difference that showed up most frequently was 
in regards to academic performance, which is developmentally applicable given that most 
youth are still in school and this may be one of the first domains to show problems due to 
AM use. However, Asian and multi-ethnic youth also reported poorer physical health even 
when controlling for level of AM use, which is something that has been shown in adult 
populations. Thus, it is crucial to address AM use early on for non-White youth, especially 
in light of findings, perhaps by increasing protective factors such as parental support (70), 
enhancing culture (71), or improving resistance skills (72).
The current study is limited by the nature of the survey data being self-report; however, AM 
data from these youth have matched AM self-reported data from national surveys (46, 67). 
We had larger samples of White, Asian, Hispanic and youth of mixed ethnicity compared to 
Black youth, yet we still found statistically significant differences for Black youth compared 
to White youth. Finally, we were unable to recontact many youth as they transitioned from 
middle school to high school; however, youth that completed the survey at wave 6 in high 
school did not differ demographically or on their AM use compared to those who did not 
complete the survey. In addition, we retained most of the sample once in high school, from 
wave 6 to wave 7, which occurred one year later.
In sum, findings suggest that during adolescence, non-White youth who report similar 
likelihood of AM use as White youth also report worse outcomes across several domains. 
One explanation for our findings is that similar levels of AM use affect diverse groups 
differently, and may be more problematic for non-white groups of youth. Thus, intervention 
programs that target AM use during this developmental period among those at-risk for 
negative outcomes might be one viable approach to ameliorating disparities in functioning. 
However, there are other preexisting factors that we did not include in the current study that 
could have potentially contributed to either AM use or lower functioning during this time 
period, such as discrimination, parental involvement, or neighborhood quality. In addition, 
although we did not find differences on demographics or AM use between those youth who 
dropped out of the study and those who continued to complete surveys, they could have 
differed on characteristics that we were unable to measure. Future work must continue to 
survey diverse groups of youth longitudinally and measure a variety of factors so that we can 
obtain a clearer understanding of how functioning may be affected by AM use during 
adolescence and emerging young adulthood and whether disparities in functioning may 
differ across different developmental milestones.

Notes: For academic performance each individual item was standardized (mean=0, SD=1), which results in possible negative scores. Social 
function scores of 0 to 35 were converted to z-scores per the scoring instructions for the PROMIS. Skewness: a skewness of 0 indicates a symmetric 
distribution. Positive skewness values such as we see here indicate a positively skewed distribution.

Note: Response rates cannot be computed from the N at each wave alone, as youth could come in and out of the study (e.g., complete waves 1, 3, 5, 
and 7, but not waves 2, 4, and 6) and still be retained in the sample. Response rates from waves 1–5 when youth were in middle school ranged from 
74%–90%, excluding new youth that could have come in at a subsequent wave. Sixty-one percent of youth (N = 2,653 of the 4,366 youth who were 
eligible for the wave 6 survey) completed the survey at wave 6. They were eligible for the wave 6 survey if they were in 6th–7th grade at wave 1, 
could be located, and were re-consented. Retention from wave 6 to wave 7 was 80%.
