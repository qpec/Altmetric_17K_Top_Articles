Abstract: Background: Environmental factors determine children’s health. Quantifying the health
impacts related to environmental hazards for children is essential to prioritize interventions to
improve health in Europe. Objective: This study aimed to assess the burden of childhood disease due
to environmental risks across the European Union. Methods: We conducted an environmental burden
of childhood disease assessment in the 28 countries of the EU (EU28) for seven environmental risk
factors (particulate matter less than 10 micrometer of diameter (PM10) and less than 2.5 micrometer
of diameter (PM2.5), ozone, secondhand smoke, dampness, lead, and formaldehyde). The primary
outcome was disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), assessed from exposure data provided by the
World Health Organization, Global Burden of Disease project, scientific literature, and epidemiological
risk estimates. Results: The seven studied environmental risk factors for children in the EU28 were
responsible for around 211,000 DALYs annually. Particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) was the main
environmental risk factor, producing 59% of total DALYs (125,000 DALYs), followed by secondhand
smoke with 20% of all DALYs (42,500 DALYs), ozone 11% (24,000 DALYs), dampness 6% (13,000
DALYs), lead 3% (6200 DALYs), and formaldehyde 0.2% (423 DALYs). Conclusions: Environmental
exposures included in this study were estimated to produce 211,000 DALYs each year in children
in the EU28, representing 2.6% of all DALYs in children. Among the included environmental risk
factors, air pollution (particulate matter and ozone) was estimated to produce the highest burden
of disease in children in Europe, half of which was due to the effects of PM10 on infant mortality.
Effective policies to reduce environmental pollutants across Europe are needed.

1. Introduction
Childhood is considered an important stage of life because children are more vulnerable than
adults to many environmental risk factors [1]. This vulnerability results from the biological sensitivity
that is an inherent characteristic of early growth and development [1]. Environmental exposures
have been proposed as important health determinants for children and adults [2]. In particular,
environmental exposures such as air pollution, heavy metals, and secondhand smoke, among
others, have been suggested as important contributors to the environmental disease burden in all
ages [3]. So far, only a few studies have estimated the environmental burden of disease during
childhood [1,4–7]. These studies have focused on a specific group of environmental pollutants [7]
or based their estimations on expert judgment (using qualitative approaches, without including a
comparative risk assessment) and not on robust evidence (using studies other than large cohort studies
or meta-analysis) [1,4,7].
In this study we aimed to estimate the burden of childhood disease due to environmental risk
factors in the European Union (EU) of the 28 countries, describing the impact of seven environmental
exposures (particulate matter less than 10 micrometer of diameter (PM10) and less than 2.5 micrometer
of diameter (PM2.5), ozone, secondhand smoke, dampness, lead, and formaldehyde), identifying
priorities in environmental health policies for childhood in Europe, and highlighting research and risk
management necessities. These seven environmental risk factors were chosen, from many possible
environmental risk factors for children, based on the strength of evidence on the causal relationship
between the risk factor and a health outcome, and the data (populational, health, and exposure)
availability across the EU of 28 countries. The environmental risk factors were defined for this study
as a physical or chemical environmental exposure that harms the health of the children. The scope
of this study does not include non-environmental risk factors, such as lifestyle, metabolic, genetic, or
those related to access to health services. This document is divided into five sections (introduction,
methods, results, discussion, and conclusion). The methods section describes the exposures and
outcome selection, data collection, and burden of disease methods. The results section summarizes the
impacts on the EU of 28 counties and describes the results for each exposure and the sensitivity analysis.
The discussion section compares the results with previous studies and explains the differences between
exposures and geographical distributions and includes a list of recommendations for authorities,
public health practitioners, and researchers.
2. Methods
2.1. Selection of Environmental Risks and Health Outcomes
This burden of disease focused only on environmental risk factors in children. Metabolic and
behavioral risk factors (e.g., sedentary, nutrition, active smoking), genetics, and those related to access
to health services were excluded from the assessment. The selection of environmental risks and health
outcomes was based on the following criteria: evidence for a causal relationship between exposure to
the environmental risk factor and the health effect (based on meta-analyses, World Health Organization
(WHO) guidelines, or previous risk assessments), independent health effects between the risk factors,
availability of exposure data at national level, and availability of baseline health statistics at national
level. Exposure-response functions and references used are shown in Table 1.

2.2. Data Collection
Our study considered the population between 0 to 18 years old of the 28 European Union
Countries (EU28) (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia,
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Malta,
Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom).
Population data by country and age were collected from the Eurostat database for the year 2015 [15]
and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) [16].
Health data was collected from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) [16,17]
and the World Health Organization [18,19] for asthma, mild mental retardation, otitis media,
lower respiratory tract infections, and infant mortality. Data for cough and low respiratory tract
symptoms [20] were collected from scientific papers and reports. Exposure data were collected from
the IHME [17] for lead, PM10, PM2.5, ozone, and secondhand smoke, the Environmental and Health
Information System (ENHIS) [21] for dampness, and from previous studies for formaldehyde [3] (see
Supplemental material). Lead exposure data from the IHME [17] database was primarily extracted from
the literature regarding blood lead concentrations. Blood lead values were derived from studies that
take blood samples and analyze them using various techniques to determine the level of lead present.
The theoretical minimum-risk exposure level (TMREL) for lead used was 2.0 mg/dL. For PM10 and
PM2.5, exposure estimates came from the IHME [17] and were drawn from multiple sources, including
satellite observations of aerosols in the atmosphere, ground measurements, chemical transport model
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 1084
4 of 13
simulations, population estimates, and land-use data. Monitor-specific measurements rather than
city averages was used. The measurements were recorded in 2014. For locations measuring only
PM10, PM2.5 measurements were estimated from PM10. This was performed using a locally derived
conversion factor (PM2.5/PM10 ratio for stations where measurements are available for the same year),
which was estimated using population-weighted averages of location-specific conversion factors for
the country. Satellite estimates were available at 11 × 11 km resolution and combine aerosol optical
depth retrievals from multiple satellites with the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model and land use
information. Estimates of the sum of particulate sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and organic carbon and
the compositional concentrations of mineral dust simulated using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport
model, and a measure combining elevation and the distance to the nearest urban land surface were
available for 2000 to 2015 for each 11 × 11 km grid cell. The TMREL for PM10 was assumed to be
7.9 µg/m3 and uniform distribution from 2.4–5.9 µg/m3 of PM2.5. For ozone, exposure data were
derived from the TM5-FASST chemical transport model, which generates a 3-month running average
of daily 1-hour maximum ozone values at the 0.1◦ × 0.1◦ for the years 1990, 2000, and 2010 [17].
The TMREL of ozone was also defined based on the exposure distribution from the American Cancer
Society CPSII study. A uniform distribution was drawn around the minimum and 5th percentile
values experienced by the cohort. This value was 33.3–41.9 ppb. Secondhand smoke exposure was
estimated based on the Health Behavior in School-aged Children survey collected between 2013 and
2014. The TMREL for secondhand smoke was zero exposure. For dampness, exposure levels were
derived from the Eurostat Statistics for Income and Living Conditions (SILC) data [17]. The TMREL
for dampness was zero exposure. For formaldehyde, country levels were obtained from national
indoor concentration data reported in the scientific literature [3]. For those countries without national
concentration reporting, the lowest level reported in other European countries was used. The TMREL
level used for formaldehyde was 100 mg/m3.
2.3. Environmental Burden of Disease
The environmental burden of disease analysis was performed following the comparative risk
assessment approach proposed by the World Health Organization [22] and the global burden of disease
project [2]. The environmental burden of childhood disease was estimated for the year 2015, using
population data from 2015 and exposure date ranging from 2013 to 2015. Exposures thresholds, if
any, were based on a counterfactual exposure distribution that would result in the lowest population
risk. The feasibility of reaching the counterfactual exposure levels in practice was not assessed here.
The burden of disease was estimated using the exposure data and a relative risk (RR) derived from
epidemiological studies to estimate the population attributable fraction (PAF). This analysis was
applied to each exposure-outcome pair. The PAF is defined as the proportional reduction in disease or
death that would occur if exposure to the risk factor were reduced to the counterfactual. The burden of
disease was calculated using disability weights (DW) and estimates of duration (L) of each outcome.
See below the explanation using three general formulas:
(1)
PAF = f × (RR − 1)/f × (RR − 1) + 1,
(2)
AP = PAF × P,
(3)
DALY = AI × DW × L,
where PAF: population attributable fraction; f: fraction of population exposed; RR: relative
risk; AP: attributable prevalence; P: background prevalence; DALY: disability-adjusted life year; DW:
disability weights; and L: duration of condition.
The disability weights used in this analysis were those proposed by the global burden of disease
project [23] or used in previous environmental burden of disease estimations [3]. For some cases an
approach based on the unit of risk (UR) was used. The UR estimated the absolute number of cases that
are to be expected at a certain exposure and then was transformed to DALYs using disability weights
and the duration of the condition. Burden from lead and mental retardation, PM2.5 and low respiratory

infections, secondhand smoke and low respiratory infections, and otitis media were obtained from the
global burden of disease project 2015 [2].
3. Results
3.1. Environmental Burden of Disease in the EU of 28 Countries
Seven different exposures were identified under the inclusion criteria, associated to six different
health outcomes (Tables 1 and 2). We estimated that in the population aged below 18 years of the
EU28, the seven environmental exposures (lead, PM10, PM2.5, ozone, secondhand smoke, dampness,
and formaldehyde), were responsible for 210,777 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) annually
(Table 2). Fifty-nine percent of these DALYs were attributable to particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5)
exposure, 20% to secondhand smoke, 11% to ozone, 6% to dampness, 3% to lead, and 0.2% related to
formaldehyde (Figure 1).

3.1.7. Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analysis for PM10 and asthma assuming a counterfactual exposure of 1.9 µg/m3
resulted in 18,681 DALYs, and assuming a counterfactual exposure of 20 µg/m3 resulted in 3885 DALYs.
We also performed a sensitivity analysis using a different exposure-response function between PM10
and asthma from a new meta-analysis; in this analysis, we estimated 45,098 DALYs [24]. The sensitivity
analysis of PM10 and infant mortality assuming a counterfactual exposure of 1.9 µg/m3 resulted
in 124,794 DALYs, and assuming counterfactual exposure of 20 µg/m3 resulted in 30,499 DALYs
(see Supplemental material). Sensitivity analysis for secondhand smoke assuming the minimum
percentage of secondhand smoke reported in the European Union 28, resulted in 12,848 DALYs for
asthma, 6867 DALYs for low respiratory infections, and 1168 DALYs for otitis media (see Supplemental
material). Sensitivity analysis for dampness and asthma, using mold (instead of dampness) as an
exposure resulted in 11,470 DALYs (see Supplemental material). Finally, the sensitivity analysis for
formaldehyde and asthma using 60 µg/m3 as a threshold resulted in 1667 DALYs (see Supplemental
material).
4. Discussion
Our results show a large impact of environmental exposures on child health across Europe.
This study found that the environmental risk factor for child health in the EU28 with the largest
impact was air pollution (PM10, PM2.5, and ozone) exposure, representing more than two thirds of
the environmental burden of disease of the seven exposures combined. This is similar to a previous
burden of disease study in six countries of Europe [3]. Secondhand smoke also showed a large impact,
resulting in 20% of the environmental burden of disease in European children.
In our analysis, we included three main air pollutants, PM10, PM2.5, and ozone. Ozone and
particulate matter have shown independent health effects. Different health outcomes were chosen
for PM10 and PM2.5. Specifically for particulate matter, scientific evidence suggests multiple health
outcomes, such as respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, or metabolic diseases, among others [25,26],
but it was not possible to include all these outcomes in our analysis, mainly because of the lack of robust
evidence (as described in the methods section) for children. The health outcomes in children that were
included in this analysis for PM10 were asthma and infant mortality [8,27], and for PM2.5 we included
lower respiratory infections [9] (see Table 1). Besides particles, we included in our analysis another
major pollutant, ozone, that has been shown to have clear and independent impacts in children [10].
Ozone has been associated with impacts on the respiratory system, especially with asthma [28], and
respiratory symptoms (such as cough and other low respiratory symptoms) [10]. In our analysis we
included cough days and days with other low respiratory symptoms as the main outcomes to ozone
exposure in children, as suggested by previous assessments [10]. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) has not
been included in this assessment to avoid double counting, since NO2 has a strong correlation with
particulate matter [27].
Overall, air pollution (PM10, PM2.5, and ozone) has the largest health impact in our analysis (70%
of all DALYs). From the 28 countries included in this analysis, 22 countries (with the exception of
Luxemburg, Ireland, Sweden, Estonia, Finland, and Denmark) have reported levels of PM10 above
the recommendations of the WHO (annual mean less than 20 µg/m3 of PM10) [29]. Ozone levels
above the level recommended by the WHO (100 µg/m3 8-hour mean) [29] have been reported in all
the EU28. Our analysis for ozone assumed as counterfactual exposure a uniform distribution in the
range of 33.3–41.9 ppb, for PM10 it assumed a counterfactual exposure of 7.9 µg/m3, and for PM2.5
a uniform distribution in the range of 2.4–5.9 µg/m3 [2,30]. Recent evidence has suggested that the
counterfactual could be lower (1.4 µg/m3 for PM2.5, corresponding to 1.9 µg/m3 of PM10) [31], so
we conducted a sensitivity analysis using these alternative counterfactual exposure concentrations,
resulting in an increase of 34% of the impacts (18,681 DALYs) associated with PM10 (see Supplemental
material). A second sensitivity analysis was performed, using as a counterfactual exposure the
recommended concentrations from the WHO guidelines of air quality for PM10 (annual mean less
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 1084
8 of 13
than 20 µg/m3) [29]. This sensitivity analysis shows what the benefits in child health would be (3885
DALYs) if the recommended WHO levels were reached in the EU28 (see Supplemental material).
These results highlight the importance of implementing specific measures to reduce child air pollution
exposure in Europe.
The main sources of air pollution in Europe are well known and include agriculture, traffic, heat,
power generation, and industry [32]. Since most of the European population lives in urban areas,
exposure to pollution from road traffic is the main source [33]. Therefore, specific policies across
Europe aimed to reduce traffic emissions should be implemented. Recent studies have suggested a
list of effective interventions to reduce air pollution in the European context through low emission
zones [34], a shift to walking, cycling and public transport [35], diversification of land use and increase
of the population density in cities [36], and improvements in agricultural practices [37], among others.
Secondhand smoke had the second largest impact (20% of all DALYs) in our environmental
burden of disease assessment. Like air pollution, secondhand smoke has been linked to multiple
health outcomes [38,39] but few dose-response functions are available to be used in a risk assessment
for children [3]. In our analysis, we included three secondhand smoke related diseases, asthma [13],
lower respiratory infections [2], and otitis media [2]. Of those, asthma had the largest impact on
DALYs, followed by low respiratory infections and otitis media. The percentage of secondhand smoke
exposure among children less than 14 years old in the EU28 ranged between 15% (in Finland) and 54%
(in Cyprus) [2]. We performed a sensitivity analysis applying the lowest percentage of secondhand
smoke exposure in the 28 European countries (see Supplemental material). This analysis showed the
impact of a simple achievable and realistic goal for all the countries. If the 28 European countries could
reduce secondhand smoke to 15% (as in Finland), 20,883 DALYs annually related to child health could
be avoided. These benefits could be achieved by applying individual and population-based measures
to reduce tobacco use in adults. Individual measures that have been described as effective smoking
cessation interventions are behavior therapy, pharmacological therapy (e.g., bupropion), physician
advice, nicotine replacement therapy, individual and telephone counseling, nursing, and self-help
interventions [40]. Population-based interventions that have also shown efficacy are smoking bans in
public spaces [41] and antismoking media campaigns [42].
Dampness has been associated with multiple respiratory outcomes like upper respiratory tract
symptoms, cough, wheeze, and asthma [43]. We included asthma as the main health outcome related
to dampness because it has robust evidence [12]. The proportion of houses with dampness was used
as a measure of exposure and ranged in the EU28 between 5% in Malta and 30% in Slovenia. Scientific
evidence has suggested a causal pathway between dampness, mold and asthma. In our analysis, we
included only dampness as exposure, but we also ran a sensitivity analysis assuming mold as main
exposure (see Supplemental material). In this sensitivity analysis we estimated similar results between
dampness and mold (12,954 DALYs annually using dampness vs. 11,470 DALYs annually using mold).
A review on housing interventions to control asthma related to mold and dampness has suggested
combined elimination of moisture intrusion and leaks and removal of moldy items for the reduction of
health risks [44].
Lead exposure in children has been widely studied and has been particularly associated with
neurodevelopmental outcomes [5]. In our assessment, we considered the impact of blood lead levels
on loss of IQ points and their translation to mild mental retardation [2,14,45], and it was estimated
that lead contributes 3% to the environmental DALYs. The blood lead levels reported in the EU of 28
countries ranged between 13 µg/l in Sweden to 104 µg/l in Romania [21]. Lead in the environment
has multiple sources, including industrial processes, paint, petrol, solder in canned foods, and water
pipes [21]. It has been suggested that lead in atmospheric air or flaked paint is deposited in soil and
dust and could be ingested by children, increasing their blood lead levels [46]. In addition, food and
water may also be important media of baseline exposure to lead [46]. Public health measures to reduce
and prevent exposure to lead have also been widely proposed [45,46]. Some of these measures are
phasing out lead additives in fuels and removing lead from petrol, reducing and phasing out the use of
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 1084
9 of 13
lead-based paints, eliminating the use of lead in food containers, traditional medicines and cosmetics,
and minimizing the dissolving of lead in water treatment and water distribution systems.
Formaldehyde is a chemical used in industrial processes, building materials, and in a wide
range of products [47]. Formaldehyde is widely prevalent both indoors and outdoors, but it reaches
high levels mostly indoors. Formaldehyde has been related in adults to nasal cancer, leukemia, and
respiratory outcomes [47] and in children, it has been related to asthma [11]. In our environmental
burden of disease assessment, formaldehyde results in a small impact on children (less than 0.2% of
all DALYs). In Europe levels are mostly under the guideline value (100µg/m3) [47]. We performed a
sensitivity analysis using an alternative threshold (60µg/m3) as suggested by previous assessments [48]
(see Supplemental material). In this sensitivity analysis we found a larger environmental burden
of disease associated with formaldehyde (33 DALYs annually in the main analysis vs 1667 DALYs
annually).
As in all burden of disease assessments, our study was limited by the availability of data and
the necessity to make assumptions to model likely scenarios. In particular, the lack of data and the
variability in availability across the EU28 was the main limitation in our study. Another limitation
in the burden of disease approach, is the lack of robust evidence of exposure-response relationships
between pollutants and health outcomes. Previous burden of disease approaches have suggested
placing greater value upon years lived by younger populations than older populations. We chose not
to include any age discount or adjust for this in our analysis. This could be a limitation because the
non-discounting approach could result in less conservative results. Another limitation is the use of
disability weights (DW) and disease duration (L) from the general population and applying these to
children. This was done due to the lack of a specific DW and L for children. The inclusion criteria used
in this assessment for pollutants and outcomes reduce the possibility of including more pollutants or
outcomes which have been studied in children. Chemical pollutants, such as bisphenol, or physical
pollutants, such as radiation, with high social interest were not included in this study due to the lack
of data availability across the EU28 and/or the lack of strength of evidence to quantify the impact on a
specific health outcome. Including only those risk factors with a strong causal relationship, supported
by large cohort studies and meta-analyses, is a strength of this assessment, ensuring a more robust
and conservative approach [49]. The conservative estimation of this environmental burden of disease
analysis considers only seven environmental risks for children in Europe. Stakeholders should use
this study to promote actions aimed to reduce those seven environmental risk factors. In addition,
stakeholders should have in mind other relevant environmental hazards (not included in this study),
such as plastics, pesticides, ionizing and non-ionizing radiations, noise or climate change, among
others, that have less available information across Europe and require research support focused on
children and promotion of mitigation actions.
To reduce the uncertainty of our analysis, we included confidence intervals for all estimates made.
We also ran several sensitivity analyses to identify the main input data that could impact more in the
magnitude of our estimates (see Supplemental material). This is the first environmental burden of
disease study focused on the EU28 that included seven environmental risk factors focused on children.
Previous assessments have only included a few European countries and focused only on one or a
few exposures [7], or not focused particularly on children [3]. Trasande et al. [7] have produced a
specific assessment of endocrine disruptors in the EU28. This specific group of pollutants has not been
included in our study because we decided to focus only on those environmental exposures that have
shown associations based on meta-analysis and not only on expert judgment.
The assessment of environmental burden of disease estimates offers the opportunity to identify
priorities and solutions for policy and research. These priorities and solutions are presented in this
study as recommendations for authorities, public health specialist, and researchers (Table 3) and are as
follows. First, this study found a real need to create and implement effective policies to reduce child
exposure to environmental risk factors across Europe, with special attention to major risk factors such
as air pollution and secondhand smoke. Second, there is a need to create common European databases,
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 1084
10 of 13
which collect and harmonize exposure data for (old and new) environmental risk factors, especially
for children. Third, there is a need for epidemiological studies on multiple environmental risk factors,
with special attention to providing dose-response functions with harmonized exposure and outcome
definitions. Currently, a number of European research projects focus on implementing the “exposome”
concept (HELIX [50]), EXPOsOMICs [51] and HEALS [52], and some of them are collecting relevant
information on multiple exposures and outcomes in children. These projects are a good example to
start filling some of these gaps.

Stakeholder
Recommendations
Authorities
Develop evidence-based policies to reduce child exposure to
environmental risk factors across Europe, with special attention to
major risk factors as secondhand smoke and air pollution
Public health practitioners
Create and develop European health databases with harmonized
exposure data for (old and new) environmental risk factors for

5. Conclusions
Environmental risk factors for children across Europe impact public health significantly.
Air pollution and secondhand smoke provide the biggest burden in children across Europe.
Evidence-based policies to reduce child exposure to environmental risk factors are urgently needed
in Europe. More research to collect and harmonize data between a wider range of environmental
exposures and health outcomes in children is needed.
