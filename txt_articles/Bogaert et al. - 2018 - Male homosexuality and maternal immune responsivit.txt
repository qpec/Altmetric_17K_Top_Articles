We conducted a direct test of an immunological explanation of the
finding that gay men have a greater number of older brothers
than do heterosexual men. This explanation posits that some
mothers develop antibodies against a Y-linked protein important
in male brain development, and that this effect becomes increas-
ingly likely with each male gestation, altering brain structures un-
derlying sexual orientation in their later-born sons. Immune assays
targeting two Y-linked proteins important in brain development—
protocadherin 11 Y-linked (PCDH11Y) and neuroligin 4 Y-linked
(NLGN4Y; isoforms 1 and 2)—were developed. Plasma from moth-
ers of sons, about half of whom had a gay son, along with addi-
tional controls (women with no sons, men) was analyzed for male
protein-specific antibodies. Results indicated women had signifi-
cantly higher anti-NLGN4Y levels than men. In addition, after sta-
tistically controlling for number of pregnancies, mothers of gay
sons, particularly those with older brothers, had significantly
higher anti-NLGN4Y levels than did the control samples of women,
including mothers of heterosexual sons. The results suggest an associ-
ation between a maternal immune response to NLGN4Y and subse-
quent sexual orientation in male offspring.
sexual orientation | homosexuality | fraternal birth order | NLGN4Y |
maternal immune hypothesis
A
fraternal birth order (FBO) effect exists in the sexual ori-
entation of men, but not of women, with older brothers (and
no other sibling characteristic) increasing the odds of male ho-
mosexuality (1–3). Although sexual orientation is likely determined
by multiple (potentially independent) factors and FBO is associated
with only a proportion of men’s sexual orientation (4–6), the effect
has been confirmed many times, including by independent inves-
tigators and in non-Western samples (2, 3, 7–10). FBO is in-
dependent of potential confounds, such as maternal age (1, 11), and
likely operates during prenatal life and not childhood (11). Evi-
dence in favor of a maternal immune hypothesis underlying FBO
includes the finding that fetal material enters maternal circulation
at parturition (12), as exemplified by male microchimerism occur-
ring in mothers of sons (13, 14) and by hemolytic disease of the
newborn (15). There is also evidence that maternal immune
products, including antibodies, can enter the fetal compartment and
pass the blood/brain barrier of the developing fetal brain (16–20).
Finally, an incremental maternal immune response occurs to a
Y-linked protein (SMCY/H-Y) in relation to prior male fetuses
(21), a phenomenon that, at times, may underlie widespread
alteration of fetal development and induce miscarriage (22).
Unlike SMCY, two Y-linked proteins—protocadherin 11 Y-
linked (PCDH11Y) and neuroligin 4 Y-linked (NLGN4Y)—
have special relevance as candidates to underlie FBO and sexual
orientation (2, 3) because they are represented in the fetal brain
and feature primarily extracellular structures (23–25), which al-
lows these proteins to be accessible to circulating antibodies.
Thus, antibodies could bind to these proteins and alter their role
in typical sexual differentiation of the brain (without necessarily
resulting in death of the affected cells or inducing miscarriage).
Both PCDH11Y and NLGN4Y are part of families of cell ad-
hesion molecules thought to play an essential role in specific
cell–cell interactions in brain development (23).
In our study, blood samples and reproductive histories were
collected from 54 mothers of gay sons (23 of whom had pre-
viously given birth to a heterosexual son) and a control sample of
72 mothers of heterosexual sons, along with additional controls
(16 women with no sons and 12 men). We developed in-house
ELISAs and used the plasma from participants to examine evi-
dence of the existence of maternal antibodies to these proteins.
Results
We examined antibody concentrations to each of these Y-linked
proteins (anti-PCDH11Y, anti-NLGN4Y isoform 1, anti-NLGN4Y
isoform 2) separately, but also used a z-scored combination of anti-
NLGN4Y isoforms 1 and 2 (combined anti-NLGN4Y). Such a
composite could provide a more reliable estimate of response to
common epitopes than either assay alone and thus might be a better
index of humoral response to NLGN4Y. Due to the skewed nature of
the assay data (Fig. S1), our main analyses employed nonparametric
statistics, which use rank-orders of data (26).
First, in a preliminary test, we expected women’s immune re-
activity to exceed men’s on the assumption that, upon exposure,
Significance
Gay men have, on average, a greater number of older brothers
than do heterosexual men, a well-known finding within sexual
science. This finding has been termed the fraternal birth order
effect. Strong scientific interest in sexual orientation exists
because it is a fundamental human characteristic, and because
its origins are often the focal point of considerable social con-
troversy. Our study is a major advance in understanding the
origins of sexual orientation in men by providing support for a
theorized but previously unexamined biological mechanism—a
maternal immune response to a protein important in male fetal
brain development—and by beginning to explain one of the
most reliable correlates of male homosexuality: older brothers.

 these male-specific substances should be perceived by the women’s
immune system as foreign to them. Using two-tailed Mann–Whitney
U tests (n = 154), this sex difference was supported for all three anti-
NLGN4Y measures (isoform 1: P = 0.007; isoform 2: P = 0.007;
combined NLGN4Y: P = 0.003), but not for PCDH11Y (P = 0.855)
(Fig. 1 and Table S1), a result that may partly reflect low antibody
responses across all participants for PCDH11Y relative to NLGN4Y
(Fig. S1).
Given that the expected sex difference was confirmed for
NLGN4Y, we then examined anti-NLGN4Y levels among
women (n = 142) using an omnibus, two-tailed, Jonckheere–
Terpstra test for ordered alternatives. In line with the maternal
immune hypothesis, the predicted ordering for antibody con-
centrations to anti-NLGN4Y was as follows: women with no
sons < mothers of heterosexual sons < mothers of gay sons with
no older brothers < mothers of gay sons with older brothers.
Mothers of gay sons with older brothers were predicted to have
the highest concentration of antibodies, but we also predicted
mothers of gay sons with no older brothers to have higher con-
centrations than mothers of heterosexual sons and women with
no sons, on the assumption that the former could be immunized
on a first male pregnancy or, for example, include a subset of
mothers immunized by miscarried and possibly undetected male
fetuses. In this analysis, we also controlled for total number of
pregnancies (live births and miscarriages) because this re-
productive variable differed among the groups and was related to
anti-NLGN4Y levels (Materials and Methods and Tables S4
and S5). The expected ordering of groups was confirmed for anti-
NLGN4Y isoform 1 (P = 0.000096) (Fig. 2), anti-NLGN4Y iso-
form 2 (P = 0.030), and combined anti-NLGN4Y (P = 0.0012).
The largest of these effects, using statistical effect size estimates
appropriate to the nonparametric statistics we employ here, would
be designated as medium (e.g., rs approximately = 0.30) (Fig. 2).
We conducted follow-up, pairwise comparisons on the NLGN4Y
results. The P values of these comparisons were one-tailed, in
keeping with the directional nature of the Jonckheere–Terpstra test.
As expected, mothers of gay sons with older brothers, relative to
mothers of heterosexual sons, had higher antibody levels on all
three NLGN4Y variables (anti-isoform 1, P = 0.00035; anti-isoform
2, P = 0.011; combined anti-NLGN4Y, P = 0.001). Mothers of gay
sons with older brothers, relative to women with no sons, generally
had higher antibody levels on all three NLGN4Y variables (anti-
isoform 1, P = 0.008; anti-isoform 2, P = 0.09; combined anti-
NLGN4Y, P = 0.023). Mothers of gay sons with no older brothers,
relative to heterosexual sons, had higher antibody levels on anti-
NLGN4Y isoform 1 (P = 0.024) and combined anti-NLGN4Y (P =
0.045). Mothers of gay sons with no older brothers, relative to women
with no sons, had higher antibody levels on anti-NLGN4Y isoform 1
(P = 0.021). Mothers of gay sons with older brothers had, relative to
mothers of gay sons with no older brothers, higher levels of anti-
NLGN4Y isoform 2 (P = 0.049) and combined anti-NLGN4Y (P =
0.047). See Table S2 for details related to the comparisons.
Discussion
NLGN4Y is presumed to play a role in male fetal brain devel-
opment (i.e., synaptic functioning) (23, 25), and is primarily ex-
tracellular in its expression, making it potentially accessible to
functional modulation by maternal antibodies upon their entry
into the fetal compartment and upon their crossing the de-
veloping blood/brain barrier of a male fetus. Such maternal im-
munological interactions are hypothesized to divert sexual
differentiation of the male fetal brain, with antibodies binding to,
and altering, male-specific cell-surface molecules, thereby alter-
ing their usual roles in the masculinization of sex dimorphic brain
structures. The strongest effects occurred for NLGN4Y isoform
1, an unsurprising finding given that it is the larger of the two
NLGN4Y isoforms and thus likely to have more epitopes.
However, both common and unique epitopes on the two iso-
forms may be relevant to the present findings, because some
analyses yielded slightly greater effects for the combined iso-
forms than for either isoform alone. It is not certain how
NLGN4Y might operate at the cellular level on the neuropsy-
chology of men’s sexual orientation, but the interaction of

 NLGN4Y with its binding partners, the neurexins, in the for-
mation of synapses (27) (Fig. 3) may influence relative sexual/
romantic attraction to others of a particular sex. The X-linked
homolog, NLGN4X, might also play a role in the formation of
sexual/romantic attractions, and antibodies raised by NLGN4Y
might alter sexual brain development by cross-reacting with fetal
NLGN4X, given its similarity to NLGN4Y. Notably, variations
in both NLGN4X and NLGN4Y are implicated in sex-linked,
neurological functioning associated with forming social connec-
tions to others: autism (25, 28).
Antibodies, along with short-lived antibody-secreting plasma
cells produced at initial antigen exposure, often disappear rela-
tively rapidly, with a half-life of 2–3 wk (29). However, long-lived
plasma cells replenish antibodies in serum and may exist in bone
marrow for an extended period, replenishing the antibody sup-
ply, even in the absence of antigen reexposure. Furthermore,
memory B cells exist for many years (presumably even beyond
long-lived plasma cells), but in order for memory B cells to dif-
ferentiate into antibody secreting (short- and long-lived) plasma
cells, they need re-exposure to the antigen (29). Thus, our main
findings, that elevated maternal antibodies to NLGN4Y are de-
tected many years after a last pregnancy and birth of a son, may
occur because one or both of the following circumstances exist:
(i) long-lived plasma cells replenish the supply of antibodies to
NLGN4Y even in the absence of antigen re-exposure and/or (ii)
memory B cells are restimulated by the antigen (e.g., via male
microchimerism) long after the original exposure occurred.
Elevated antibody levels observed in the mothers of gay sons
in our study are probably only a relative index of the physio-
logical levels that existed years earlier during the hypothesized
events affecting male fetal development. Thus, between-groups
differences detected now (e.g., mothers of gay sons with older
brothers vs. mothers of heterosexual sons) are likely not the
same magnitude as the between-groups differences that existed
during the relevant pregnancies.
Some evidence of an elevated antibody response to NLGN4Y
was observed in some women with no sons. Notably, women
without known male pregnancies may nonetheless have immune
responses to male-specific proteins (30), potentially reflecting
(undetected) miscarriages of male fetuses, or even possible im-
munization from exposure to biological material (e.g., semen)
during intercourse (31). Indeed, significant male microchimerism
(>20%) has been detected in women without any known male
pregnancy (30), making possible an immune response to male-
specific proteins that remains detectable long after initial
exposure. Caution is warranted in interpreting our finding,
however, given our small sample of women with no sons.
Our results begin to explain one of the most reliable correlates
of sexual orientation in men (i.e., FBO) and provide evidence of
a specific biological mechanism underlying men’s sexual orien-
tation: a maternal immune response to a Y-linked protein im-
portant in male fetal brain development. A maternal immune
mechanism does not exclude other factors (e.g., prenatal hor-
mones, genetics) advanced to explain sexual orientation (32, 33).
Indeed, although most of our key effects were of a notable sta-
tistical magnitude (i.e., medium in effect size), it is also clear that
only a portion of variation in men’s sexual orientation is
accounted for by these effects. Sexual orientation is clearly a
complex phenomenon with likely many factors influencing it.
Materials and Methods
Participants. To recruit participants, advertisements were placed on a Ca-
nadian university campus, in Kijiji, in local LGBT (lesbian/gay/bisexual/trans-
gender) magazines and radio stations, and in local newspapers. Participants
were also recruited through local Pride festivals, along with local chapters of
PFLAG (Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays). Six mothers were recruited
through a child and adolescent gender identity service at the Centre for
Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Toronto. Brock University and CAMH
research ethics boards approved this study.
Of the 159 participants who were recruited, 59 were mothers of het-
erosexual son(s) only (could have daughters, but sons were heterosexual
only), 48 were mothers of at least one gay son (but could have heterosexual
sons and/or daughters), 16 were women with no sons (11 with daughters only,
5 with no known pregnancies), 6 were mothers of at least one son diagnosed
with gender dysphoria (but could have additional sons and/or daughters),
13 were mothers of sons who had an unconfirmed sexual orientation because
the sons were too young to know their sexual orientation (could have
daughters as well), 3 were mothers of at least one adult transsexual child, and
2 were mothers of at least one bisexual son. Finally, 12 of the participants
were men.
The mothers of at least one gender-dysphoric son were reclassified as
mothers of at least one gay son because most of these gender-dysphoric sons
were likely to be gay men as adults (34, 35). The mothers of sons who had an
unconfirmed sexual orientation were reclassified as mothers of heterosexual
sons only, because the vast majority of these children were likely to be
heterosexual as adults (36, 37). The three mothers of (adult) transsexuals and
the two mothers of bisexual sons were not assigned to any other groups
because their offspring’s sexual orientation could not be classified with any
degree of certainty into gay or heterosexual categories. Thus, the final
groups of participants in the analyses were: 54 mothers of at least one gay
son (23 born after at least one older brother and 31 who did not have any
older brothers), 72 mothers of at least one heterosexual son (and with no
gay sons), 16 women with no sons, and 12 men. Although the three mothers
of transsexuals and two mothers of bisexual sons were not assigned to any

 of the study groups, their data were used for some analyses (e.g., data
preprocessing). We reran our main analyses filtering out the mothers of at
least one son with gender dysphoria and the mothers of sons who had an
unconfirmed sexual orientation (n = 19). Although power was decreased
due to a loss of participants, the size and direction of between group dif-
ferences were similar to that obtained with these participants included.
Thus, these excluded participants are not driving the significant results in the
full sample.
Participants ranged in age from 18 to 80 years. Participant age, in years,
was calculated as the date of examination minus their reported date of birth.
The sample sizes and mean ages of the five study groups are presented in
Table S3. One male subject neglected to report his age, so the mean age for
that group is based on 11 cases. A one-way ANOVA showed that age dif-
ferences between the five groups were statistically significant: F(4, 148) =
17.09, P < 0.0001, n = 153. The main driver of this result was the large dif-
ference between the groups of mothers of sons and the groups of men and
women with no sons, some of whom were young adults without children.
Measures. Outcomes of each pregnancy were identified by mothers as a mis-
carriage/abortion, stillbirth, or live birth. Mothers reported the biological sex of
each fetus (i.e., male, female, or unknown). Mothers reported on the sexual
orientation (or gender identity) of each child (i.e., heterosexual, gay, lesbian,
bisexual, transsexual, or unknown); however, mothers of gender-dysphoric boys
did not report on the sexual orientation of their son. Instead the sexual orien-
tation of gender-dysphoric boys was, as mentioned, classified as gay, based
on research that indicates such boys are most likely to be gay men as adults (34,
35). For a list of all pregnancy-related questions completed by the mother, see
Skorska et al. (38).
Blood Sample Collection and Processing. Participants were met at their homes or
on campus by a research assistant and a phlebotomist. First, participants com-
pleted a consent form and a questionnaire on demographics (e.g., age) and, if
female, on their pregnancy history. A 10-mL sample of whole blood was drawn
from the participants using sodium heparin coated vacutainers (BD Biosciences).
Participants were then debriefed and compensated financially.
The whole-blood sample was processed in our laboratory after extraction,
typically within 3–4 h. For the purpose of this study, we extracted the plasma
using the Ficoll method. Whole blood was mixed with an equal volume of
sterile PBS solution and overlaid drop-by-drop on 10 mL of Ficoll in a 50-mL
tube. The tube and its contents were centrifuged without braking for 30 min
at 600 × g at room temperature. After centrifugation, the upper plasma
layer was carefully extracted into 2-mL aliquots and stored at −80 °C or in
liquid nitrogen until ELISAs were conducted.
Recombinant Protein Generation. Recombinant proteins were generated
through custom orders: PCDH11Y (Genscript) and NLGN4Y (Creative Bio-
mart). Briefly, constructs were generated for PCDH11Y (NM_032971.1),
NLGN4Y transcript variant 1 (NM_014893.4; extracellular domain: 44–676 aa),
and transcript variant 2 (NM_001164238.1; extracellular domain: 29–206 aa).
HEK293 cells were used for transfection of the constructs and purification of
recombinant proteins. The two NLGN4Y isoforms have overlapping and
nonoverlapping amino acid sequences (Fig. S2) and likely have both com-
mon and unique epitopes.
ELISA. Protein coating concentrations and plasma dilutions were optimized in
our laboratory to obtain the best signal/background ratio. Standard ELISA
procedures were carried out. Briefly, 96-well ELISA microplates were coated
with the relevant recombinant proteins: 0.125 μg per well of PCDH11Y or
0.125 μg per well of NLGN4Y isoform 1 or 2. Plasma from each participant
was titrated and detected with a secondary anti-human IgG antibody la-
beled with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). Finally, a substrate chromogen
(TMB Substrate; item #7004, Cell Signaling Technology) was added to reveal
the immune reaction and optical density was measured using a Biotek
ELx800 plate reader. A standard curve was generated for each ELISA plate to
normalize the ELISA signal: anti-PCDH11Y antibody (Sigma) and anti-
NLGN4Y antibody (Sigma) were titrated for the generation of the standard
curve (Fig. S3). Of note, participants from each group (see, for example,
Table S3) were represented on each ELISA plate to minimize batch effects,
and the individual who performed the ELISA procedure was blind to the
group assigned to each participant on each plate.
Data Preprocessing. Assays were run in six batches. Using one-way ANOVA on
observed concentrations, no batch effect was detected for anti-PCDH11Y, F(5,
153) = 0.84, P = 0.523, n = 159, or for anti-NLGN4Y isoform 1, F(5, 153) =
1.76, P = 0.124, n = 159; however, a batch effect was found for anti-NLGN4Y
isoform 2, F(5, 153) = 4.66, P = 0.001, n = 159. Because relative, rather than
absolute antibody concentrations were of primary interest, we removed the
effect of batch from our measure of anti-NLGN4Y isoform 2 by saving the
standardized residuals (n = 159). We used these z-scored anti-NLGN4Y iso-
form 2 concentrations (corrected for batch) in all analyses in the main text
and Supporting Information.
As mentioned in the text, in addition to using anti-NLGN4Y isoform 1 and
batch-corrected anti-NLGN4Y isoform 2 separately, we also used a z-scored
combination (combined anti-NLGN4Y). The Spearman correlation between
anti-NLGN4Y isoform 1 and batch-corrected anti-NLGN4Y isoform 2 (ρ =
0.41, P < 0.0001, n = 159) further supported a combination of their assay
results into a composite measure. To produce the combined anti-NLGN4Y
measure, we standardized the scores for anti-NLGN4Y isoform 1 and then
added the (uncorrected) z-scores for isoform 1 to the (corrected) z-scores for
isoform 2 (n = 159).
To check whether participants’ age at examination would need to be
controlled for, we conducted Spearman’s correlations of age with anti-
PCDH11Y, anti-NLGN4Y isoform 1, batch-corrected anti-NLGN4Y isoform 2,
and combined anti-NLGN4Y. The correlations were small, ranging from
0.024 to 0.129, and none was statistically significant (n = 153). We also ex-
amined years from last pregnancy in all mothers. Across all mothers (n =
137), the correlations with antibody level were similar in magnitude to those
of age at examination, ranging between 0.010 and 0.109, and none was
significant. Age at examination and years from last pregnancy were there-
fore not examined in remaining analyses.
To check whether total number of pregnancies (live births plus miscarried
fetuses) would need to be controlled for, we conducted Spearman’s corre-
lations of pregnancy with anti-PCDH11Y, anti-NLGN4Y isoform 1, batch-
corrected anti-NLGN4Y isoform 2, and combined anti-NLGN4Y within all
women (n = 142) and within mothers only (n = 137). As shown in Table S4,
the correlations were negative in direction and were generally significant
for the three anti-NLGN4Y measures, ranging from −0.153 to −0.229. These
results suggested that pregnancy per se might have a tolerogenic effect (39)
with regard to NLGN4Y. A one-way ANOVA also showed that differences in
number of pregnancies between the four groups were statistically signifi-
cant, F(3, 138) = 7.10, P = 0.0002, n = 142 (Table S5). Thus, in the key analysis
of group comparisons among women for anti-NLGN4Y (see above), we
controlled for total number of pregnancies. To do this, regression analyses
were conducted with each of the antibody variables as criterion variables
and number of pregnancies as the predictor. The standardized residual was
