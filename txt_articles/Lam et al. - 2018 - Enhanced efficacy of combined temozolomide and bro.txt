Effective treatment for glioblastoma (GBM) is limited by the presence of the blood–brain
barrier (BBB) and rapid resistance to single agent therapies. To address these issues, we
developed a transferrin-functionalized nanoparticle (Tf-NP) that can deliver dual combination
therapies. Using intravital imaging, we show the ability of Tf-NPs to traverse intact BBB in
mice as well as achieve direct tumor binding in two intracranial orthotopic models of GBM.
Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with Tf-NPs loaded with temozolomide and the bromo-
domain inhibitor JQ1 leads to increased DNA damage and apoptosis that correlates with a
1.5- to 2-fold decrease in tumor burden and corresponding increase in survival compared to
equivalent free-drug dosing. Immunocompetent mice treated with Tf-NP-loaded drugs also
show protection from the effects of systemic drug toxicity, demonstrating the preclinical
potential of this nanoscale platform to deliver novel combination therapies to gliomas and
other central nervous system tumors.

nano-sized liposomal drug carriers of cancer therapies
such as Doxil® largely depend on passive enhanced vas-
cular permeation effects to achieve preferential accumulation in
tumor tissues1. We recently developed a polyethylene glycol
(PEG)ylated liposomal nanoparticle (Zavg dh ~ 130 nm), which,
like Doxil®, achieves stability in the circulation, but in addition,
can be functionalized via a PEG 2000 Dalton (Da; PEG2k) surface
linker with molecular targeting ligands such as folate, and has the
ability to partition a hydrophobic drug in the lipid envelope while
incorporating a hydrophilic drug in the aqueous interior of the
liposome for delivery of dual combination therapies in a single
nanoparticle (NP), achieving durable uptake by tumors in vivo
when delivered systemically (Fig. 1a)2. The simplicity and ver-
satility of this NP led us to hypothesize that it may also have the
ability to traverse the blood–brain barrier (BBB), which has much
greater vascular restrictions and tight endothelial barriers to NP
transport (with upper size limit of blood-tumor barrier
pores
~7–100 nm)3, if functionalized with molecular ligands that can
facilitate transport across the BBB4.
Glioblastoma (GBM; WHO Grade IV glioma) is the deadliest
primary brain malignancy with a mere median survival of
~15 months with current standard of care therapies5. Improving
treatment outcomes for GBM have been limited by the inability to
deliver most chemotherapies and novel small molecule inhibitors
across the BBB, which effectively excludes most molecules >400
Da6. Despite enhanced permeability and leakiness of glioma-
associated tumor vessels, the heterogeneous distribution of tumor
vessels, the paucity of intervening tumor cells in the vicinity of
these vessels, and altered cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics,
prevents effective delivery of chemotherapies to tumor cells7. To
address this challenge, NPs have recently been employed to
enhance the delivery of existing and novel therapies across the
BBB8.
NPs are stable polymeric encapsulation systems that can be
used to deliver multiple cargo to the central nervous system
(CNS)9. Functionalizing the surface of NPs with ligands to protein
receptors that are commonly expressed on the surfaces of brain
capillary endothelium and glioma cells can facilitate delivery
across the BBB via receptor-mediated transcytosis and subsequent
tumor targeting. Such ligands include transferrin, folate, lacto-
ferrin, interleukin peptide, and low-density lipoprotein4. Intra-
cellular transport vesicles can readily accommodate NPs between
100 and 200 nm in diameter via receptor-mediated transcytosis
allowing for versatility and adaptability of a wide range of NP
constructs10. Our previous work demonstrating durable uptake of
folate-functionalized NPs in flank xenograft mouse models of
triple-negative breast and non-small cell lung cancers led us to
hypothesize that we could adopt this NP platform for the delivery
of novel combination therapies within a single liposomal nanos-
cale carrier to intracranial mouse models of GBM2.
Finally, the therapeutic efficacy of cancer nanomedicines not
only hinges on their ability to target tumors efficiently, they must
be able to sustain stability in the systemic circulation without
premature release of payload, avoiding effects of systemic drug
toxicity and adverse off-target tissue effects. Surface modification
of liposomes with PEG imparts a steric barrier to the NPs that
decreases
their
recognition
and
clearance
by
the
reticu-
loendothelial system, imparting “stealth-like” properties, thereby
increasing circulation time, allowing for accumulation at the
tumor site, and minimizing adverse drug toxicities. This is seen
with the PEGylated liposomal formulation of doxorubicin
(Doxil®), which greatly reduces the cardiotoxicity of doxor-
ubicin11. Similarly, GBM patients treated with temozolomide
(TMZ), the standard of care chemotherapy for GBM, develop
significant bone marrow suppression5. In this study, we show that
transferrin-functionalized PEGylated NPs (Tf-NPs) can be used
to deliver novel combination therapies across the BBB in two

 intracranial orthotopic mouse models of GBM. Tumor-bearing
mice treated with Tf-NPs loaded with TMZ and the bromodo-
main inhibitor JQ1 have decreased tumor burden and prolonged
survival compared to mice treated with TMZ and JQ1 packaged
in non-functionalized NPs or free drug combinations. Further-
more, we show that mice treated with liposome-encapsulated
therapies have relative protection from systemic drug toxicity,
demonstrating the potential for translation of this nanoscale
platform to improve outcomes for patients with CNS tumors.
Results
Functionalized NPs can cross the intact BBB in mice. We first
performed biodistribution studies in non-tumor-bearing mice
using NPs that were functionalized with a 1,2-distearoyl-sn-gly-
cero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[amino(polyethylene
glycol)-
2000] (DSPE-PEG2K) linker conjugated with Cy5.5-Transferrin
(Tf-NP) or DSPE-PEG2K-Cy5.5-Folate (Fol-NP) to assess their
ability to cross the intact BBB. Non-functionalized PEGylated NPs
(PEG-NP)
or
NPs
functionalized
with
DSPE-PEG2K-Cy5.5-
Hemagglutinin (Hg-NP) served as negative controls. We chose to
use Cy5.5 fluorescence imaging, understanding that it was a semi-
quantitative technique for assessing biodistribution of NPs com-
pared to radio-isotope labeling, to simply demonstrate as proof of
concept that the conjugated NPs were able to be transported across
intact BBB. Mice given I.V. Tf-NPs demonstrated 1.7% total uptake
of the injected dose in the brain, compared to 0.9% in Fol-NP-
treated mice, respectively, with negligible accumulation in mice
injected with PEG-NP or Hg-NPs, 24 h following the injections
(Supplementary Fig. 1A). Quantification of confocal microscopy
images through fresh frozen coronal brain sections showed highest
accumulations of Tf-NPs in the brain compared to Fol-NPs, with
no significant increases in Cy5.5 fluorescence signal detected using
Hg-NPs compared to unconjugated PEG-NPs (Supplementary
Fig. 1B,C). This provided further preliminary evidence that the
functionalized NPs can cross the intact BBB in mice.
We then performed multiphoton intravital live imaging
through a cranial window (Fig. 1b) to assess the ability of these
NPs to cross the BBB in non-tumor bearing mice. To control for
vessel leakiness, we injected 70 kDa FITC-Dextran intravenously
to ensure vessel integrity following the cranial window procedure
(Supplementary Movie 1). Autofluorescence was controlled by
increasing signal to noise ratio, thus all Cy5.5 red fluorescence
seen in this and subsequent intravital images represents the
presence of Cy5.5-labeled NPs only. As Tf-NPs demonstrated the
highest percent uptake in the brain and had the smallest average
diameter (Zavg dh ~ 137 nm) (Table 1), we decided to conduct the
remainder of our experiments using Tf-NPs. As a negative
control,
we
injected
Hg-NPs
intravenously
and
failed
to
demonstrate uptake by the endothelium of brain microvessels
(Fig. 1c). In contrast, Tf-NPs demonstrated transport across the
endothelium of microvessels into the surrounding subarachnoid
space (Fig. 1d). This was further appreciated upon imaging 500
μm deeper into the cortical mantle, where diffusion of Tf-NPs
was observed across an isolated section of a microvessel, forming
a diffusion gradient of NPs away from the blood vessel (Fig. 1e).
Gliomas take up transferrin-functionalized NPs. We next
assessed the ability of Tf-NPs to achieve receptor-mediated
transcytosis in two intracranial orthotopic mouse models of
gliomas: the human U87MG and murine GL261 glioma models.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining demonstrated transferrin
receptor expression in the endothelium of tumor-associated blood
vessels and on tumor cells in both U87MG and GL261 tumor-
bearing mice, with relatively higher intensity of staining in
U87MG compared to GL261 tumors (Fig. 2a; α-Tf Receptor). This
increased uniform staining for the transferrin receptor throughout
the tumor was not seen in serial sections stained using control IgG
antibody (Fig. 2a; IgG Control). Western blot analysis also further
demonstrated
~1.4-fold
increased
expression
of
transferrin
receptor in U87MG compared to GL261 cells, consistent with the
relative differences in staining intensity observed between tumor
types on IHC (Fig. 2b). Our findings are consistent with studies
demonstrating transferrin receptor expression in U87MG12 and
GL26113 cells, suggesting that transferrin would be suitable as a
ligand for our NPs for assessing receptor-mediated transcytosis
and tumor targeting as previously reported in the literature14, 15.
We first assessed the ability of U87MG and GL261 cells to
internalize Tf-NPs in vitro. Cells incubated with Cy5.5-Tf-NPs
showed increased intracellular Cy5.5 signal which co-localized to
late endosomal/lysosomal compartments compared to cells incu-
bated with Cy5.5-PEG-NPs, visualized using immunofluorescence
microscopy over the course of 24 h (Fig. 2c). This intracellular
uptake was then quantified using flow cytometry, demonstrating
an average of 13% Cy5.5-positive cells after 24 h of incubation
with Cy5.5-Tf-NPs, compared to <1% Cy5.5-positive cells after
incubation with Cy5.5-PEG-NPs (Fig. 2d). These results suggest
that functionalization with transferrin is required for cellular
uptake of NPs in U87MG and GL261 glioma cells.
We then assessed the ability of Tf-NPs to achieve delivery to
brain tumors in vivo. Tumors were allowed to grow for 14 days
post implantation. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with an I.V.
injection of Tf-NPs on day 14 post-tumor induction and their
tumors subjected to multiphoton imaging 7 days following I.V.
injection (tumor induction day 21). Multiphoton imaging
demonstrated accumulation and uptake of Tf-NPs on the surface
of U87MG (Fig. 2e, upper right panels & Supplementary Movie 2)
and GL261 tumors (Fig. 2e, lower right panels & Supplementary
Movie 3), demonstrating the ability of Tf-NPs to achieve
accumulation and retention on the surface of intracranial
gliomas. This was in stark contrast to non-functionalized NPs
(PEG-NPs) which failed to demonstrate accumulation or uptake
by U87MG and GL261 tumors (Fig. 2e, left panels), suggesting
that transferrin functionalization is required for transport across
the BBB and delivery of NPs to glioma-bearing mice.

 TMZ and bromodomain inhibitor therapy is additive in glio-
mas. Current gold standard of care treatment for gliomas in
humans includes the DNA damage-inducing alkylating agent
TMZ5. We recently published the novel observation that inhibi-
tion of BET bromodomain proteins with the potent small
molecule inhibitor JQ1 regulates the DNA damage response in
multiple cancer cell lines in vitro, including U87MG cells16, and
others have also reported antitumor effects following BET bro-
modomain inhibition in mouse models of glioma17. As gliomas
show rapid resistance to TMZ18, we hypothesized that the addi-
tion of a bromodomain inhibitor may further sensitize gliomas to
TMZ therapy. To demonstrate sensitivity of the glioma cell lines
to bromodomain inhibition, we first treated U87MG and
GL261 cells with 500 nM JQ1 for 48 h and observed increased
γH2AX DNA damage foci formation in cells (Fig. 3a). DNA
damage foci were also seen in cells treated with 150 μM TMZ,
with additive effects when cells were treated with both JQ1 and
TMZ (Fig. 3a).
To further explore the combinatorial effects of TMZ and JQ1,
we performed conventional IC50 analyses in U87MG and
GL261 cells and calculated combinatorial indexes using these
two drugs. Cells treated with incremental log-fold increases in
JQ1 in the presence of 150 μM TMZ demonstrated decreased
viability quantified using the CellTiter-Glo® viability assay
(Fig. 3b, red lines) compared to cells treated with log-fold
increases of JQ1 alone (Fig. 3b, blue line). Calculation of JQ1 and
TMZ combinatorial index (C.I.) values using the Chou–Talalay
method19 generated C.I. values of 0.95 and 0.94 for U87MG and
GL261 cells, respectively, suggesting that the combination of JQ1
and TMZ achieved additive cytotoxic effects. This data was in line
with our observation that single agent JQ1 or TMZ treatment was
able to elicit DNA damage in glioma cells, and that the
combination of JQ1 and TMZ increased DNA damage over
either drug alone (Fig. 3a).
Tf-NP encapsulated drugs have superior therapeutic efficacy.
We next interrogated the therapeutic efficacy of drug-loaded NPs
compared to free drug dosing in our mouse models of glioma.
Despite TMZ and JQ1 both having good penetration across the
BBB20, 21, only 20% of total serum drug levels of TMZ are
achieved in the CSF at best20 (a paucity of data regarding the
neuropharmacology for JQ1 exists), thus we hypothesized that the
ability to package both drugs in NPs for targeted delivery to the
site of the tumor would combat CSF washout effects and increase
treatment efficacy. To test this, we first packaged TMZ and JQ1
into NPs (Fig. 4a, schematic) and characterized the kinetics of
drug release from the NPs. Single or dual drug-loaded NPs were
incubated in float-a-lyzer® devices with a 100,000 MW cut-off at
37 °C in normal saline with agitation. Samples were removed
from the devices at multiple time points over a course of 72 h and
analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography to
quantify drug release from the NPs over time. NPs loaded with
JQ1 demonstrated ~90% release of drug by 24 h (Fig. 4b) while
NPs loaded with TMZ demonstrated an attenuated release profile
with ~90% release by 48 h (Fig. 4c). Dual drug-loaded NPs
demonstrated similar release kinetics with relatively more rapid
release of JQ1 compared to TMZ and complete release of both
drugs by 72 h (Fig. 4d).
Tumor-bearing
mice were then treated
daily with I.V.
injections of vehicle, JQ1, TMZ, or JQ1 + TMZ in free drug
form, or drugs packaged in either non-functionalized PEG-NPs
or Tf-NPs at equivalent doses of 2 mg kg−1 per drug for 5 days
and tumor signal evaluated using luciferase bioluminescence.
Both U87MG (Fig. 5a) and GL261 (Fig. 5b) tumors showed
decreases in tumor signal following 5 days of free JQ1 or TMZ
compared to vehicle-treated mice, with additive effects when both
drugs were combined. Mice treated with drug-loaded PEG-NPs
demonstrated similar decreases in tumor signal compared to mice
treated with free-drug, however, mice treated with equivalent
doses of drugs packaged in Tf-NPs experienced slower long-
itudinal tumor growth quantified using bioluminescence imaging
compared to mice treated with free drug or PEG-NP drug
regimens across all treatment arms (Fig. 5c, d). U87MG mice
treated with Tf-NP encapsulated JQ1 and TMZ demonstrated a
99.1% decrease in tumor signal compared to an 82% and 79%
decrease in signal when treated with free JQ1 and TMZ or dual
drug-loaded PEG-NPs, respectively, after 7 days of treatment
(Table 2). Similarly, GL261 mice treated with Tf-NP encapsulated
combination therapies demonstrated a 99.3% decrease in tumor

 signal compared to a 97% and 96% decrease in signal in mice
treated with either free drug combinations or dual drug-loaded
PEG-NPs, respectively (Table 2). These results suggest that
functionalization of drug-loaded NPs with transferrin allows for
targeted delivery of drugs across the BBB to tumor cells in vivo to
achieve significant reductions in tumor burden compared to
untargeted drug-loaded NPs, which only achieve reductions in
tumor burden similar to free drug regimens.
Finally,
treatment
with
Tf-NP
therapies
translated
into
significantly prolonged survival of U87MG (Fig. 5e; solid lines)
and GL261 (Fig. 5f; solid lines) mice compared to mice treated
with either free drug (Fig. 5e, f; dashed lines) or drug loaded in
PEG-NPs (Fig. 5e, f; dotted lines). These results suggest that the
ability of Tf-NPs to achieve receptor-mediated transcytosis across
the BBB and accumulate at the site of glioma tumors (Fig. 2e)
allows for superior delivery of drugs into tumor cells, compared
to free drugs or drugs encapsulated in non-functionalized NPs.
Tf-NP therapies have increased pharmacodynamic effects
in vivo. To test the hypothesis that Tf-NPs achieve increased
delivery of drugs to tumors compared to free drug regimens, we
performed IHC staining of brain sections of U87MG and GL261
mice to quantify the amount of DNA damage and apoptosis in
tumors between the different treatment arms. U87MG and GL261
mice were sacrificed 1 week following treatment initiation and
brains were sectioned and stained for markers of DNA damage
(γH2AX), apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3), and proliferation (Ki-67).
Mice treated with drug-loaded Tf-NPs had brain tumors that
showed increased staining for γH2AX and CC3 compared to mice
that received free drug (Fig. 6 & Supplementary Fig. 2). These
increases in markers of DNA damage and apoptosis corresponded
with decreased numbers of cells that stained positive for the
proliferative marker Ki-67 in both U87MG and GL261 tumors
(Fig. 6 & Supplementary Fig. 2), suggesting that our observed
binding of Tf-NPs on the surface of tumors led to effective release
of drugs into the parenchyma of U87MG and GL261 tumors.
Furthermore, tumors from U87MG and GL261 mice treated with
dual drug-loaded Tf-NPs showed significantly increased DNA
damage and apoptosis with decreased proliferation compared to
mice treated with single drug-loaded Tf-NPs (Fig. 6 & Supple-
mentary Fig. 2). These results demonstrate the superior efficacy of
combined TMZ and bromodomain inhibitor therapy when
packaged in functionalized dual drug-loaded NPs in achieving
tumor control and survival in mice with gliomas compared to
treatment with equivalent combination free drug dosing.
NP therapies protect from systemic drug toxicity. Finally, we
hypothesized that the protective PEGylated packaging and
imbued stealth capability of the NPs would offer relative shielding
from the known systemic toxicities of JQ122 and TMZ23. To test
this, we performed serial daily blood monitoring of red blood cell
(RBC), white blood cell (WBC), and platelet (PLT) levels in
immunocompetent BL6 mice throughout the treatment period
comparing values between mice treated with free drug versus Tf-
NP-loaded drug. Mice treated with free JQ1, TMZ, or JQ1 +
TMZ had progressive leukopenia (Fig. 7a) and thrombocytopenia
(Fig. 7b) over the 5-day course of treatment. In contrast, mice
treated with drug-loaded Tf-NPs had significantly more stable
WBC and PLT levels over the treatment course, suggesting that
the PEGylated exterior of the NPs protected the mice from drug
toxicity effects. There were no significant changes in the red blood
cell counts in either treatment arms (Fig. 7c). Furthermore, mice
treated with drug-loaded Tf-NPs maintained their body weight
and body conditioning scores compared to mice treated with free
drug, which demonstrated significant weight loss and poor body
conditioning (Fig. 7d). Although we did not perform liver func-
tion tests, we extrapolated that the lack of weight loss and
maintained body conditioning in mice treated with drug-loaded
NPs was an indication of normal liver function despite the NPs
having a high degree of tropism for the liver as shown in our
biodistribution studies. This data supports the ability of these
PEGylated NPs to compartmentalize drug and retain it in the

 circulatory system in stealth mode while achieving targeted
therapeutic effects in the brain.
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report comparing the
efficacy of combined TMZ and bromodomain inhibitor therapy in
multiple models of GBM using a ligand-targeted liposomal
nanocarrier. Studies have shown therapeutic efficacy using
daunorubicin-loaded liposomes functionalized with transferrin
and p-aminophenyl-α-D-manno-pyranoside in C6 rat intracranial
orthotopic tumors24, or transferrin modified cyclo-[Arg-Gly-Asp-
D-Phe-Lys]-paclitaxel
conjugate
loaded
micelles25
and
doxorubicin-loaded liposomes dual functionalized with a D-
peptide ligand of the acetylcholine receptor and cyclic-[Arg-Gly-
Asp] peptide26 in U87MG intracranial orthotopic tumors, how-
ever, neither daunorubicin, paclitaxel, nor doxorubicin are first-
line therapies for GBM. Transferrin-functionalized magnetic silica
poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) NPs have been used recently to
deliver doxorubicin and paclitaxel simultaneously to intracranial
orthotopic U87MG tumors, however the application of this
technology is limited due to FDA restriction on human exposure
to magnetic fields27. Our transferrin functionalized, dual-drug
loading liposome system effectively delivers FDA-approved TMZ
and a bromodomain inhibitor (which is currently in clinical trials
for several different types of cancers, including glioma28) to
tumors in the brain with the ability to enhance survival and reduce
systemic toxicity, reflecting the translational potential to use this
platform to deliver novel combination therapies to improve
treatment resistance in patients across multiple CNS tumor types.
Brain capillary endothelial cells express receptors for transfer-
rin, folate, insulin, leptin, low-density lipoprotein, and insulin-like
growth factor to allow for transport of essential nutrients
including transferrin, glucose, and insulin to maintain brain
homeostasis15. Malignant tumor cells in the brain also express
transferrin and folate receptors, amongst others, on their cell
surfaces4, 29, 30. For these reasons, these ligands have been widely
exploited for receptor-mediated transcytosis of nanotechnology
across the BBB for targeted delivery to brain tumors31. IHC
staining of U87MG and GL261 brain tumors demonstrated
transferrin receptor expression in tumor-associated blood vessels
and tumor cells (Fig. 2a) and intravital imaging showing uptake
of Tf-NPs into the endothelium of brain microvessels (Fig. 1e)
and at the tumor site (Fig. 2e), suggests that functionalization of
our NPs with transferrin allows for receptor-mediated transcy-
tosis despite having an average diameter of 140 nm. Furthermore,
the lack of accumulation of non-functionalized NPs at the tumor
site suggests that functionalization with transferrin is required for
delivery of the NP across the BBB to the site of the tumor
(Fig. 2e). We further postulate that the increased therapeutic

 response in the U87MG model over the GL261 model is likely
due to the approximately 1.4-fold increase in transferrin receptor
expression in U87MG cells compared to GL261 cells (Fig. 2b),
allowing for enhanced retention of Tf-NPs at the site of U87MG.
This also points to the need for careful screening of surface
receptor protein levels in patients with gliomas at the time of
biopsy or surgical resection in order to achieve a personalized
approach to ligand-targeted nanotherapy.
Bromodomain inhibitors are currently in different phases of
preclinical and clinical trials for the treatment of multiple tumor
types32. Two recent studies have demonstrated in vitro and
in vivo efficacy of JQ117 and an orally bioavailable bromodomain
inhibitor OTX01533 in murine models of glioma. Cheng and
colleagues reported apoptosis and decreased levels of Myc, Bcl-2,
and Bcl-xL following JQ1 treatment in primary patient-derived
glioma xenografts in nude mice17. Berenguer-Daize et al. reported
single agent efficacy of JQ1 or OTX015 alone or in combination
with TMZ, everolimus, or SN38 in U87MG, T98G, and U118
GBM cell lines, and in heterotopic and orthotopic U87MG
xenografts in nude mice33. Interestingly, a common theme that
emerged from both studies is that inhibition of Myc following
bromodomain inhibition does not appear to factor into the anti-
tumor mechanism of drug action in glioma cells. This is further
supported by the observation that JQ1 does not reduce BRD4
occupancy at the MYC enhancer in U87MG cells34. Our obser-
vations that treatment of U87MG and GL261 cells with JQ1 leads
to increased markers of DNA damage and apoptosis both in vitro
(Fig. 3a) and in vivo (Fig. 6 & Supplementary Fig. 2) suggest that
this novel mechanism of DNA damage following bromodomain
inhibition can be harnessed in combination with other DNA
damage repair pathway inhibitors to increase cell death across
multiple tumor types. Finally, despite the anti-tumor effects of
bromodomain inhibitors, its potent systemic toxicity profile may
ultimately limit its use in the clinic. The ability of a targeted
nanocarrier to shield against its toxicity may help overcome this
hurdle to improve its safety and efficacy.
Methods
Chemicals and reagents. (+)-JQ1 was purchased from Cayman Chemicals. TMZ
was purchased from Sigma. DOPG and POPG were purchased from Avanti Polar
Lipids. DSPE-PEG2K/end-functionalized DSPE-PEG2K-(NH2/maleimide) was
purchased from Nanocs, Inc. Cholesterol, sodium, sodium carbonate, and solvents
(chloroform, methanol, phosphate buffered saline) were purchased from Sigma.
Liposome preparation. Liposomes were formulated at a mass ratio of 56:39:5
(DSPC:Cholesterol:POPG). (+)-JQ1 was dissolved along with these three compo-
nents (weight ratio to total lipid ratio = 3:50) in a 2:1 mixture of chloroform:
methanol. A thin film of these materials was generated by rotary evaporation at 40 °
C at 150 mbar and dessicated overnight until completely dry. Hydration of the lipid
film was conducted at 65 °C under sonication in 300 mM citrate buffer (pH 4) for
1 h. Functionalization of liposomes with DSPE-PEG2K-folate (Fol-NP), DSPE-
PEG2K-Hg10K (Hg-NP), or DSPE-PEG2K-transferrin (Tf-NP) and DSPE-PEG2K-
Cy5.5 was conducted using a post-fabrication, post-insertion technique in which
micelles of the components (5 mg functional lipid:50 mg total lipid) were incubated
with the drug-loaded liposomes under sonication at 65 °C for 30 min followed by
filtration through a 0.2 μm PES (polyethersulfone) syringe filter. TMZ was added in
a 0.9% sodium chloride solution to load through a pH gradient method. The
dispersed solution was sonicated at 65 °C for 5 min to facilitate solubilization of
TMZ. The final drug-loaded system was exchanged into PBS (pH 7.4) following
centrifugal filtration (100 K MWCO Millipore) to remove citrate and sodium
carbonate and any unloaded drug. Empty (lacking drug) liposomes were for-
mulated in the same fashion. Zeta potential measurements were used to confirm
the presence of targeting moieties on the surface of the PEGylated base liposome.

 No precise quantification of number of targeting groups on the surface of the NP
was conducted.
Liposome characterization and drug release studies. Dynamic light scattering
and zeta-potential analysis were conducted in 10 mM sodium chloride at 25 °C
using a Malvern ZS90 zeta-sizer. High-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC; Agilent technologies) was used to validate drug loading of (+)-JQ1 (λabs =
260 nm, elution ~ 10 min) and TMZ (λabs = 260 nm, elution ~ 2 min). Drug-loaded
NPs were then placed inside float-a-lyser devices with a 100,000 MW cut-off
(Spectrum Labs) and immersed into normal saline at 37 °C with agitation. Samples
were collected at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 48, and 72 h and percent drug remaining in
the NPs was determined using HPLC as described above. Data are presented as
mean ± SEM for three separate experiments.
Biodistribution studies. NCR nude mice (Taconic) were used for biodistribution
studies. To attenuate gut fluorescence, an alfalfa-free special diet (AIN-93M
Maintenance Purified Diet from TestDiet) was fed to mice 1 week prior to and
during experimentation. Cy5.5-labeled PEG-, Hg-, Fol-, or Tf-conjugated liposomes
suspended in PBS were administered via tail vein injection. Recovered Cy5.5
fluorescence in necropsied organs was measured using bioluminescence in vivo
imaging (IVIS, Caliper Instruments) with LivingImage™ software (Xenogen), per-
formed at 24 h post injection and reported as % injected dose per gram tissue (%ID).
JQ1 and TMZ sensitivity assays. For immunofluorescence of γH2AX DNA
damage foci, U87MG and GL261 cells were grown on glass coverslips coated with
poly-L-lysine (Gibco). Cells were exposed to 500 nM JQ1, 150 μM TMZ, or com-
bination of both JQ1 + TMZ for 48 h, then washed three times with PBS and fixed
using 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Cells were blocked with goat serum in
Triton X-100 and PBS for 1 h and incubated in γH2AX antibody (EMD Millipore,
Catalog No. 05-636) at 1:1000 dilution overnight at 4 °C. Coverslips were washed
three times in PBS and incubated in secondary Alexafluor antibody (Invitrogen,
Catalog No. A11001) and DAPI counterstain (ThermoFisher, Catalog No. 62248)
both at 1:1000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted onto
glass slides using ProLong Gold Antifade mountant (ThermoFisher) and images
were taken using a Nikon Eclipse 80i fluorescence microscope.
JQ1 and TMZ C.I. studies. For JQ1 and TMZ C.I. assays, cells were seeded onto
384-well plates in triplicate repeats and treated with a combination matrix of
concentrations of JQ1 ranging from 0 to 1.6 μM and TMZ ranging from 0 to 1.25
mM for 72 h. Cell viability was measured using CellTiter-Glo® assay and results
normalized to wells containing DMSO vehicle control. C.I. values were calculated
using the Chou–Talalay method with CompuSyn software. Data are presented as
mean ± SEM for three separate experiments.
In vitro NP uptake studies. U87MG and GL261 cells were grown on glass cov-
erslips coated with poly-L-lysine (Gibco). Cells were incubated at 37 °C with PEG-
Cy5.5-NP or Tf-Cy5.5-NP for 12 and 24 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS
before fixing with paraformaldehyde and processed for immunofluorescence using
LAMP1 (Abcam, Catalog No. ab24170) as a lysosomal marker and DAPI (Ther-
moFisher, Catalog No. 62248) as a DNA stain both at 1:1000 dilutions. For
quantification of intracellular uptake by flow cytometry, cells were harvested at 24 h
following incubation with PEG-Cy5.5-NP or Tf-Cy5.5-NP, washed once in PBS
and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and PBS with 1% BSA. Cells were washed three
times in PBS with 1% BSA. Ten thousand events were recorded and gated for
Cy5.5 signal on a FACS Canto II flow cytometer. Percent Cy5.5 positive cells were
quantified using FlowJo® software. Data are presented as mean ± SEM from three
biological replicates. Statistical significance determined using Student’s t test (*p <
0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).
Quantification of Cy5.5-labeled liposomes in the brain. NCR nude mice were
given 200 μL of Cy5.5-labeled PEG-, Hg-, Fol-, Tf-, or CTX-conjugated liposomes
suspended in PBS via tail vein injection and their brains harvested 24 h post
injection. Five micron thick fresh frozen coronal sections were prepared and
stained with DAPI (ThermoFisher, Catalog No. 62248) prior to fluorescence
imaging of Cy5.5-labeled liposomes (Cy5.5 channel excitation, 640 nm; emission,
700 nm) and DAPI-stained nuclei (excitation, 360 nm; emission, 460 nm) using a
Nikon A1R Ultra-Fast Spectral Scanning Confocal Microscope (Nikon Instruments
Inc.). Average integrated fluorescence intensity of Cy5.5-labeled liposomes in the
brain was quantified using ImageJ. Statistical significance determined using Stu-
dent’s t test (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).
Intracranial tumor implantation and monitoring. All animal experimentation was
performed in compliance with relevant ethical regulations in adherence with the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals and received institutional approval from the Committee on Animal Care at
MIT. U87MG human glioma cells were purchased through ATCC and maintained in
DMEM media (Gibco) with 10% FBS (Hyclone). GL261 mouse glioma cells were a
gift from Dr. M. Hemann and were maintained in DMEM (Gibco) with 10% FBS
(Hyclone), 1× Glutamine (Gibco), and 1× Pen/Strep (Sigma). All cell lines were tested
for mycoplasma and subjected to IMPACT testing for pathogens prior to use in
experiments. Cell lines were transduced with a lentiviral pLMP-GFP-Luc vector to
allow for stable expression of eGFP and firefly luciferase prior to implantation. Six-
week-old NCR nude (Taconic) or C57/BL6 male mice (Taconic) were used to gen-
erate intracranial orthotopic U87MG or GL261 gliomas, respectively. In brief, mice
were anesthetized using 2% isoflurane and their heads immobilized in a stereotactic
headframe using atraumatic ear bars. A burr hole was made using a steel drill bit
(Plastics One, Roanoke, VA, USA) 1.4 mm right of the sagittal and 1 mm anterior to
the lambdoid suture. Tumors were allowed to grow for 14 days prior to com-
mencement of treatment. Intracranial tumor growth was monitored in vivo using
bioluminescence IVIS® imaging (Xenogen, Almeda, CA) equipped with LivingImage™
software (Xenogen). Mice were randomly separated into each treatment arm: (i) Free
drug vehicle (DMSO in 5% β-cyclodextran in 0.9% sodium chloride), (ii) Free
(+)-JQ1, (iii) Free TMZ, (iv) Free (+)-JQ1 plus TMZ, (v) Tf-NP loaded with vehicle,
(vi) Tf-NP loaded with (+)-JQ1, (vii) Tf-NP loaded with TMZ, (viii) Tf-NP loaded
with (+)-JQ1 plus TMZ, (ix) PEG-NP loaded with vehicle, (x) PEG-NP loaded with
(+)-JQ1, (xi) PEG-NP loaded with TMZ, or (xii) PEG-NP loaded with (+)-JQ1 plus
TMZ. Mice were treated 14 days following tumor implantation daily with 100 μL I.V.
of free drug or drug-loaded NPs daily for 5 days and tumor response to treatment
was tracked every 3–5 days using IVIS imaging. Mice were given 150 μL I.P. of 30 mg
mL−1 D-luciferin (PerkinElmer) dissolved in PBS 10 min prior to IVIS imaging.
Signal intensity was quantified within a region of interest using LivingImage™ soft-
ware. Eight mice were used per treatment arm to ascertain statistical significance.
Multiphoton intravital imaging through a cranial window. To fashion a cranial
window, the skull was thinned away using a sterile stainless steel 2 mm diameter
cylindrical drill bit attached to a high-speed hand drill until the underlying dura
mater was exposed. Multiphoton imaging was performed on an Olympus FV-
1000MPE multiphoton microscope (Olympus Americas, Waltham, MA) using a
×25, N.A. 1.05 water objective. Excitation was achieved using a DeepSee Tai-
sapphire femtosecond pulse laser (Spectro-Physics, Santa Clara, CA) at 840 nm. The
emitted fluorescence was collected by PMTs with emission filters of 425/30 nm for
Collagen 1, 525/45 nm for GFP-labeled tumor cells and 668/20 nm for Cy5.5 NPs.
Collagen 1 was excited by second harmonic generation and emits as polarized light
at half the excitation wavelength. To control for vessel leakiness, we injected 70 kDa
FITC-Dextran intravenously to ensure vessel integrity following the cranial window
procedure. Autofluorescence was controlled by increasing signal to noise ratio, thus
all Cy5.5 red fluorescence seen in this and subsequent intravital images represents
the presence of Cy5.5-labeled NPs only. All images were processed using ImageJ.
IHC of brain sections. Brains were harvested two days post treatment for IHC
studies. Mice were perfused with neutral buffered formalin via cardiac puncture
and their brains extracted and left overnight submersed in formalin. Brains were
processed in 5 μm thick sections following paraffin embedding and IHC performed
to detect transferrin receptor (ThermoFisher, Catalog No. 13-6800), γH2AX (Cell
Signaling Technology, Catalog No. 9718S), cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signaling
Technology, Catalog No. 9664S), and Ki67 (Abcam, Catalog No. ab16667). Mouse
IgG (Santa Cruz, Catalog No. sc-2025) was used as a control to assess specificity of
transferrin receptor staining. All antibodies were used at 1:200 dilution. Visuali-
zation of stained nuclei was performed using DAB staining (Vector Labs, USA).
Slides were digitally scanned at ×20 magnification using an Aperio Digital Slide
Scanner (Leica) and viewed using the Aperio digital pathology viewing software
(Leica). Positively stained nuclei were quantified using ImageJ. Statistical sig-
nificance determined using ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
***p < 0.001).
Western blotting. U87MG and GL261 cells were harvested and lysed in low salt
lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, pH 7.4)
supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Complete mini EDTA-
free and PhosSTOP, Roche Applied Science). Normalized samples were loaded
onto 4–12% precast Tris-glycine gradient gels (Life Technologies), subjected to
SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto 0.2 μm nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad).
Immunoblotting was performed using monoclonal antibodies against transferrin
receptor (ThermoFisher, Catalog No. 13-6800) and actin (Sigma, Catalog No.
A5441) each at 1:1000 dilution. Protein bands were visualized following incubation
with Li-Cor fluorescent secondary antibodies (Li-Cor, Catalog No. P/N 925-32212
and P/N 925-68072) at 1:20,000 dilution using a Li-Cor Odyssey Infrared Imaging
System (Li-Cor) and quantified using Odyssey software (Li-Cor). Actin was used as
a loading control. Protein band intensity quantified using Li-Cor Odyssey software.
Intensity of bands averaged over three separate experiments. Uncropped blots are
included in Supplementary Information Section.
Systemic drug toxicity profiling. Serial daily blood sampling was performed
throughout the course of drug treatment and specimens analyzed on the day of
sample collection independently by the animal testing laboratories at MIT. Daily
body weights were recorded throughout the course of drug treatments. Five mice
were used per treatment arm to determine statistical significance.
