ABSTRACT
Background: Flavanols are an important class of food bioac-
tives that can improve vascular function even in healthy sub-
jects. Cocoa flavanols (CFs) are composed principally of the
monomer (−)-epicatechin (∼20%), with a degree of polymeri-
sation (DP) of 1 (DP1), and oligomeric procyanidins (∼80%,
DP2–10).
Objective: Our objective was to investigate the relative contribution
of procyanidins and (−)-epicatechin to CF intake–related improve-
ments in vascular function in healthy volunteers.
Design: In a randomized, controlled, double-masked, parallel-
group dietary intervention trial, 45 healthy men (aged 18–35 y)
consumed the following once daily for 1 mo: 1) a DP1–10
cocoa extract containing 130 mg (−)-epicatechin and 560 mg
procyanidins, 2) a DP2–10 cocoa extract containing 20 mg (−)-
epicatechin and 540 mg procyanidins, or 3) a control capsule,
which was flavanol-free but had identical micro- and macronutrient
composition.
Results: Consumption of DP1–10, but not of either DP2–10 or the
control capsule, significantly increased flow-mediated vasodilation
(primary endpoint) and the concentration of structurally related (−)-
epicatechin metabolites (SREMs) in the circulatory system while
decreasing pulse wave velocity and blood pressure. Total cholesterol
significantly decreased after daily intake of both DP1–10 and DP2–
10 as compared with the control.
Conclusions: CF-related improvements in vascular function are
predominantly related to the intake of flavanol monomers and
circulating SREMs in healthy humans but not to the more abundant
procyanidins and gut microbiome–derived CF catabolites. Reduction
in total cholesterol was linked to consumption of procyanidins
but not necessarily to that of (−)-epicatechin. This trial was
registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02728466.

INTRODUCTION
Evidence from clinical dietary intervention studies has
accumulated that links cocoa flavanol (CF) intake in humans
with improvements in vascular function and health (1). CFs
comprise several individual compounds, including monomeric
flavanols such as (–)-epicatechin and typically smaller amounts
of (+)-catechin, as well as procyanidins, which represent
oligomeric flavanol derivatives with a degree of polymerization
(DP) ranging from 2 to 10 (2). Whereas (–)-epicatechin can
represent between 15% and 20% (by wt) of CFs, procyanidins
make up 80–85% (by wt) (3).
We have previously established a causality chain between
the intake of one of the constituents of CF, namely (−)-
epicatechin, the subsequent absorption and presence of (−)-
epicatechin metabolites in the systemic circulation, and acute
nitric oxide–dependent arterial dilation [i.e., flow-mediated
vasodilation (FMD)] in humans (4). In this context, we and others
have shown that (−)-epicatechin is absorbed in the proximal
gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and is transiently present in the

FIGURE 1
Schematic of the fate of cocoa flavanols in the gastrointestinal tract. Only the monomeric flavanol (−)-epicatechin is absorbed in the
small intestine and metabolized to the major SREMs (–)-epicatechin-3�-O-glucuronide, 3�-O-methyl-(–)-epicatechin-5-sulfate, and (–)-epicatechin-3�-sufate.
Oligomeric procyanidins are neither absorbed nor metabolized in the small intestine. Both monomers and procyanidins are catabolized by gut microbes in the
colon, leading to ring fission products including γ VL, which, in turn, is absorbed and further metabolized to γ VLMs. DP, degree of polymerization; SREM,

human systemic circulation in the form of various structurally
related (−)-epicatechin metabolites (SREMs), which include
(–)-epicatechin-3�-O-glucuronide, 3�-O-methyl-(–)-epicatechin-
5- and -7-sulfate, and (–)-epicatechin-3�-sulfate (5, 6) (Figure 1).
In contrast, there is no evidence that procyanidins, especially
those with a DP of >2, are absorbed in the GIT as intact
procyanidin molecules, and they are not present in the systemic
circulation in humans (7). Nor do procyanidins break down in
the GIT in ways that contribute to the circulating pool of SREMs
(7). However, novel advances demonstrate that the human micro-
biome may play a crucial role in understanding the bioactivity of
CFs (6). Approximately 70% of the ingested (−)-epicatechin is
absorbed via the colon after catabolism by the microbiota, giving
rise in the systemic circulation to sulfated and glucuronidated
metabolites of 5-(3�,4�-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ -valerolactone (γ VL)
and 5-(3�,4�-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ -hydroxyvaleric acid, corre-
sponding to 42% ± 5% of (−)-epicatechin intake (6). Pro-
cyanidins are also subject to microbiome-mediated catabolism,
which contributes significantly to the concentrations of γ VL
metabolites in humans (7, 8). Overall, we estimated that 43%
and 54% of the γ VL metabolites present in human plasma
after the intake of CFs originate from the flavanol monomers
and procyanidins, respectively (7). Taken together, the role
of the gut microbiome in flavanol and procyanidin absorption
and metabolism is important, because gut microbiome–derived
CF metabolites represent a major part of the CF metabolome
present in the human circulation. Thus, γ VL metabolites
represent principal candidates for CF-derived metabolites causal
in mediating the cardiovascular effects observed after dietary
CF intake. Consequently, with the use of CF as a model, the
main goal of this investigation was to undertake a dietary in-
tervention study to establish the respective relative contributions
of flavanol monomers and DP2–10 procyanidins in mediating
the cardiovascular effects observed after cocoa intake in humans
and to assess the roles of SREMs and γ VL metabolites in these
processes.
METHODS
Study subjects
A total of 45 healthy Caucasian men, aged between 18 and 35
y, were recruited at the University of Dusseldorf (January 2015–
May 2016). [See Table 1 for their characteristics and Figure 2
for the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)
study flow]. The study subjects were screened based on a clinical
physical examination that included blood pressure measurement,
an electrocardiogram, and routine clinical tests (blood lipids,
C-reactive protein, full blood count, liver enzymes, hemoglobin,
glucose). Inclusion criteria for participation in the study were
as follows: 18–35 y of age, Caucasian, male, BMI (kg/m2)
of 23–27, and signed consent form. Exclusion criteria were

Test materials
All test materials were provided by Mars, Inc., in the form
of identical capsules that were in identical bottles, each labeled
with 1 of 3 alpha-numeric codes. Each participant consumed
2 capsules/d. The DP1–10 capsules made with cocoa extract
provided 690 mg total CFs, of which 130 mg was (−)-epicatechin
and 560 mg was DP2–10 procyanidins. The DP2–10 capsules
contained a cocoa extract with total of 560 mg CFs, of which 20
mg was (−)-epicatechin and 540 mg was DP2–10 procyanidins.
The control capsules contained no CFs, but their caffeine and

Study design
A randomized, controlled, double-masked, and parallel-group
dietary intervention trial was performed consisting of 3 interven-
tions. The 45 study participants were assigned to 1 of 3 parallel
groups (n = 15 each): the DP1–10, DP2–10, or control group
(Table 2). The randomized assignment list was generated with a
software freely available on www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/rand
omize2/ (GraphPad Software, Inc.).
Each intervention was preceded by a 24-h low-flavonoid diet,
where volunteers were instructed to refrain from the consumption
of flavonoid-rich foods, including fruits and vegetables, cocoa,
chocolate, tea, coffee, and alcohol. During each arm, participants
consumed daily with their breakfast, for a period of 1 mo,
2 capsules containing one of 1) DP1–10 flavanol monomers
and procyanidins, 2) DP2–10 procyanidins, or 3) a flavanol-
free control extract with matched micro- and macronutrient
composition (Table 2).
Measurements were taken before (baseline) and at 2 h after the
first capsules on day 1 and at 1 mo (days 28–30). Compliance was
assessed by the collection of empty bottles on the last study day
visit.
FMD was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were
plasma and urinary concentrations of SREMs and sulfated
and glucuronidated metabolites of the colonic catabolite γ VL.
Tertiary endpoints included other determinants of vascular func-
tion, such as blood pressure, arterial stiffness [including pulse
wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index], blood lipids
(plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol,
LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides ), and fasting plasma glucose.
Volunteers were asked to follow a low-flavonoid diet until the
next morning when the 24-h urine was collected. Volunteers were
also asked to complete a 48-h dietary questionnaire to assess
compliance with the low-flavonoid diet. A qualified researcher
enrolled the participants into the study. All researchers involved
in conducting the study or assessing outcomes were blinded
with regard to the identity of the test products. The study was
conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of
Helsinki, all procedures involving human subjects were approved
by the University of Dusseldorf Research Ethics Committee,
and written informed consent was obtained from all study
participants. The study was registered with the NIH randomized
trials registry at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02728466.

FMD and power analysis of the primary endpoint
FMD was measured in the brachial artery of the right
arm by the use of 5-min forearm occlusion by ultrasound
(Vivid I; GE Healthcare) in combination with a semiautomated
analysis system (Brachial Analyzer, MIA) (9). The intra- and
interindividual variabilities in FMD measurements established
in our laboratory are 0.9% (the SD of the difference between
repeated FMD measurements in n = 20 healthy subjects;
Christian Heiss, 2015) and 1% (the SD within a group of healthy
subjects), respectively (10). FMD was defined as the primary
outcome. Based on previous intervention studies with CFs, a
change in FMD of 1.3% was anticipated (11). Assuming an SD
of the change in FMD of 1%, 15 subjects/group would provide
sufficient power to detect an absolute change in FMD of 1.2%
(2-sided α of 0.0167%, power = 0.80) between groups with the
use of a Bonferroni correction in pairwise comparisons (12).
Quantification of SREMs and γVL metabolites by HPLC
SREMs and γ VL metabolites were analyzed in urine and
plasma by HPLC with fluorescence detection, as described by
Ottaviani et al. (5, 7). Blood samples were collected before
and at 2 h postconsumption on day 1 and after 1 mo of daily
consumption of test capsules with the use of EDTA-coated tubes.
Plasma was obtained by whole-blood centrifugation at 1800 × g
for 15 min at 4◦C, separated into several 1.2-mL aliquots and
spiked with ascorbic acid to provide a final concentration of 1
mg/mL. Subjects were also asked to collect urine samples for
24 h following test product consumption on day 1 and at 1 mo.
The total volume for each period was recorded. Immediately
after collection, urine samples were transferred into 14-mL tubes,
acidified with 560 μL of 2 mol sodium acetate/L at pH 4.5 and
56 μL of 0.5% thymol (wt:vol) in isopropanol, and finally stored
at −80◦C prior to analysis.
Blood pressure measurements
Office blood pressure was measured with the use of an
automated clinical digital sphygmomanometer (Dynamap) at the
upper left arm in a supine position, after 10 min of supine rest in
a quiet room and with the arm at heart level. At each time point, 3
blood pressure measurements were taken. The first was discarded
and the remaining 2 were used to provide an average that was used
for further analyses.
PWV
PWV was determined from applanation tonometry mea-
surements taken at the carotid and femoral arteries with a
SphygmoCor system, as previously described (13).
Blood lipids and glucose measurements
Total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglyc-
erides, and fasting plasma glucose were measured by the Institute
for Clinical Chemistry, University of Dusseldorf, with the use of
standard accredited assays.
Statistical analysis
The characteristics of the study population are expressed as
means ± SDs (Table 1). The primary test for an effect in the
randomized controlled trial was a univariate ANCOVA followed
by post hoc pairwise comparisons comparing the responses due
to DP1–10, DP2–10, and the control (fixed factors) at 1 mo
(dependent) with baseline values as covariates to account for
baseline differences. Responses to treatments were calculated
as changes in respective parameters (e.g., FMD): 1-mo values
minus baseline values on day 1. Mean values of parameters are
presented as means ± SEMs, and differences between responses
are presented as means with Bonferroni-adjusted 95% CIs. We
also analyzed the difference between responses at 2 h after acute
consumption of the 3 interventions on day 1 and at 1 mo as
compared with the 0-h baseline on day 1 by the use of repeated-
measurements ANCOVA, with baseline values as covariates.
Analyses were computed with SPSS 24 (IBM Corp.).
RESULTS
The study population consisted of 45 young, healthy male
volunteers (Figure 2), and their baseline characteristics are
detailed in Table 1. All values were within the normal range
for healthy individuals, and there were no significant differences
between groups. The test capsules were well tolerated, and no
adverse events were reported in the context of this study. All
subjects assigned to the interventions received the interventions,
completed the trial, and were analyzed for the primary endpoint.
Endothelial function improves after intake of DP1–10
flavanols but not after intake of DP2–10 flavanols
During this 1-mo randomized controlled trial, the consumption
of DP1–10 led to a significant improvement in FMD as compared
with the control and DP2–10 (Table 3), taking baseline values
of FMD as a covariate into account. FMD improvement after
the consumption of DP1–10 over the control at 1 mo was 1.4%
(95% CI: 0.7%, 2.2%). FMD improvement after the consumption
of DP1–10 over DP2–10 at 1 mo was 1.7% (95% CI: 0.9%,
2.5%). Figure 3 shows that similar improvements were observed
at 2 h after the first capsules on day 1 but that there were no
further improvements at 1 mo and 2 h after consumption of
the last DP1–10 capsules, but not after taking DP2–10 or the
control capsules. There was no significant time × intervention
interaction (P = 0.101), suggesting that the effect of DP1–10
did not differ between the time points. The baseline diameter of
the brachial artery and endothelium-independent nitroglycerin-
mediated vasodilation remained unaffected by either intervention
(data not shown).
SREMs and γVL metabolites in plasma and urine
At the beginning of the study on day 1, the concentrations of
SREMs in all but 2 subjects were below the limit of detection
(Table 3), which is consistent with the low-flavonoid diet that
volunteers followed for 24 h prior to the beginning of the study.
Ingestion of DP1–10, but not DP2–10 or the control, led to a
significant increase in plasma SREMs by 611 nmol/L (95% CI:
483, 739 nmol/L; Figure 4A) at 2 h after acute consumption on

day 1. After 1 mo of daily consumption and following overnight
fasting, fasting concentrations were low and not significantly
different from control or DP2–10 concentrations. These results
could be explained by the short half-life of SREMs and the
overnight fasting of the study subjects prior to the measurements
(8). In contrast to the control and DP2–10, additional acute
ingestion of DP1–10 led to an increase of 847 nmol/L (95%
CI: 679, 1016 nmol/L) in the concentration of plasma SREMs.
However, these concentrations were not significantly different
from the increases observed after the acute intake on day 1.
Analysis of 24-h urine (Figure 4B) showed that only DP1–
10, but not DP2–10, led to significantly higher urinary excretion
of SREMs compared with the control, with no difference
between day 1 and 1 mo. Although γ VL metabolites result
from gut microbiome cleavage of both flavanol monomers and
procyanidins, cleavage is more efficient in monomers (8). Plasma
concentrations of γ VL metabolites were only significantly
increased at 1 mo in the DP1–10 group; the increase after DP2–10
consumption was not significant (Table 3). However, the analysis
of 24-h urine (Figure 4C) showed that the urinary excretion of
γ VL metabolites was significantly greater in both DP1–10 and
DP2–10 compared with the control, with no difference between
day 1 and 1 mo. However, DP1–10 led to significantly greater
amounts of excreted γ VL metabolites.
Intake of DP1-10 flavanols, but not DP2-10, decreases blood
pressure and PWV
A significant decrease in office systolic blood pressure was
observed at 1 mo after consumption of DP1–10 compared with
the control (−6.7 mm Hg; 95% CI: –12.6, –0.9 mm Hg) and DP2–
10 (−6.5 mm Hg; 95% CI: –12.4, –0.6 mm Hg). No changes

with respect to the control (−0.3 mm Hg; 95% CI: –5.8, 5.3
mm Hg). The time × intervention interaction was not significant
(P = 0.271), suggesting that the effect of DP1–10 did not differ
between the time points (Figure 5A).
A decrease in office diastolic blood pressure was also observed
1 mo after consumption of DP1–10 as compared with DP2–10
(–6.9 mm Hg; 95% CI: –13.0, –0.8 mm Hg), but was not
significant when compared with the control (−5.5 mm Hg; 95%
CI: –11.6, –0.6 mm Hg), taking the baseline diastolic blood
pressure as a covariate into account. The consumption of DP1–10
led to a significant decrease in PWV at 1 mo of −1.0 m/s (95% CI:
−1.6, −0.4 m/s) compared with the control and of −0.8 m/s (95%
CI: −1.4, −0.2 m/s) compared with DP2–10 (Table 3, Figure 5B).

Both DP1–10 (–22 mg/dL; 95% CI: –40, –4 mg/dL) and
DP2–10 (–19 mg/dL; 95% CI: –37, –1 mg/dL) led to a
significant decrease in total cholesterol after 1 mo of consumption
compared with the control (Figure 5C). No significant changes in
triglycerides, plasma glucose, or HDL or LDL cholesterol were
observed in any of the groups.
DISCUSSION
With the use of CFs as a model, the relative contribution
of flavanol monomers and procyanidins in mediating the
cardiovascular effects observed after dietary intake was assessed.
It was also our intention to gain insights into the potential role
of gut microbiome–derived CF metabolites in mediating the
bioactivity of flavanol monomers and procyanidins. The data
obtained show that acute and sustained intake of CF DP1–10,
containing 130 mg of the monomer (−)-epicatechin and 560 mg
of procyanidins, led to significant improvements in endothelial
function and decreases in blood pressure and vascular stiffness.
In contrast, intake of DP2–10, which contained 540 mg of
procyanidins and a much-reduced 20 mg of (−)-epicatechin, had
no significant effect on these parameters.
Based on experiments performed in vitro, it was previously
speculated that, upon ingestion, dietary procyanidins are broken
down by the colonic microbiome to yield (−)-epicatechin
or other flavanol monomers (14). However, in humans in
vivo, procyanidin digestion does not yield (−)-epicatechin, and
consequently procyanidins do not contribute to the circulating
pool of SREMs (7). Instead, after intake, procyanidins are
degraded by the colonic microbiota, and the resulting catabolites,
including γ VLs, are absorbed in the distal GIT (7). The current
investigation confirmed these findings and demonstrated that the
consumption of CF procyanidins DP2–10 resulted in significant
increases in γ VL metabolites, but not SREMs, in plasma and
urine. This demonstrates that the impact of CF on vascular health
is linked to (−)-epicatechin and not to CF procyanidins, and
it follows that the vascular effects on FMD, PWV, and blood
pressure are mediated by SREMs and not γ VL metabolites.
Based on the 30-d duration of the study and the range of the
outcomes investigated, it is tenable that significant direct effects
of procyanidin intake and γ VL metabolites on vascular function

would have been observable if γ VL metabolites exhibited bioac-
tivity in this context. Although we consider this interpretation as
relevant and likely applicable at a larger scale, in view of the
inherent limitations of the study design, and in particular the
relatively small number of subjects, we cannot completely rule
out the possibility that in longer-term exposures of larger groups
of subjects who are more representative of the general population
circulating γ VL metabolites may be demonstrated to exert effects
on cardiovascular function. Furthermore, this investigation did
not extend to potential procyanidin intake–related and γ VL
metabolite–mediated health benefits beyond the modulation of
vascular function. In addition, circulating γ VLs represent a
recently validated nutritional biomarker of flavanol monomer and
procyanidin intake (8), and thus continue to be of great interest in
this area. This overall conclusion supports the notion that SREMs
are the bioactive mediators of CF intake–related vascular effects
and provides greater clarity and guidance for investigations,
both in vitro and ex vivo, that are aimed at elucidating the
specific mechanisms of action underlying the biological effects
observed after the intake of CFs. These findings also have
important implications beyond CFs, inasfar as they are very likely
applicable to other flavanol-containing foodstuffs. However, this
does not mean that procyanidin intake is without any impact
on cardiovascular health, and although not directly affecting
FMD, PWV, or blood pressure, procyanidins may affect the effect
size of flavanol- or SREM-mediated effects by preserving and
protecting flavanols, such as (−)-epicatechin, from oxidation or
degradation in foods during processing and storage or in the
GIT during digestion. Moreover, procyanidin intake may, via
its impact on cholesterol absorption and fecal steroid excretion
inside the GIT, mediate decreases in total plasma cholesterol
concentrations, as seen here in humans (Table 3) and elsewhere
in rats (15), and thus exert cardiovascular health benefits over
greater time spans than could be investigated in the current study.
The latter 2 points are also highly relevant in the context of 2
recent publications that aimed at assessing the biological effects
of pure epicatechin in the context of cardiovascular function, and
which did not find significant effects (16–18). When designing
studies that use pure epicatechin, based on replicating previous
investigations that use epicatechin-containing foods or food
extracts, such as cocoa or cocoa extracts, various aspects should
be taken into account. Not just the epicatechin intake amount
studied (19, 20) but also the composition of the food matrix in
which the compound is ingested have to be considered. In this
context, the various indirect effects of procyanidins described
above and elsewhere, as well as the effect of size-modulating
coingestion of methylxanthines (caffeine and/or theobromine)
(19) naturally present in cocoa and tea, are important factors
in the effect size as it relates to the cardiovascular effects thus
far investigated. Consequently, direct comparisons between the
effects of epicatechin ingested as an isolated compound and
consumed as part of a complex food matrix need to be considered
carefully.
Although research into the role of the gut microbiome in
human health is still in its infancy, especially in the context
of nutrition and primary disease prevention, various reports
highlight the importance of specific members of the microbiome
or specific microbiome-derived metabolites for human health
(21–24). Although a specific analysis of the gut microbiome
and its constituent phyla and genera lay outside the scope
of this investigation, the specific γ VL metabolites identified
here in the context of flavanol and procyanidin intake were
present in all participants of this study. Further, the work of
previous investigators also supports the supposition that the gut
microbiome–mediated formation of γ VLs is more likely than not
to be an event common across human populations and a wider
range of diet and lifestyle choices (6). Although the biological
effects of circulating γ VL metabolites, if any, are currently
unknown, data based on testing these compounds in cell culture
models suggest various potential bioactivities (25, 26). Whether
or not these in vitro findings can be translated into the context of
human health maintenance has yet to be established.
In conclusion, our data indicate that the vascular effects after
CF intake can be predominantly ascribed to the bioactivity of (−)-
epicatechin and that procyanidins do not contribute directly to CF
intake–mediated acute and longer-term vascular effects in healthy
humans. In view of potential future dietary recommendations
for flavanol intake in the context of cardiovascular health
maintenance and disease prevention, these findings are of great
relevance. Further large-scale research is needed to confirm
or refute this notion, but ongoing studies, especially the 5-y
COSMOS trial, which is currently studying the effects of CF
intake on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in 22,000 men
and women in the United States, will be important for doing so.
Moreover, in order to be able to establish recommended intake
values or to recommend the consumption of certain foods, the
biologically active compounds should be identified and their
content in foods should be known. Although considerable efforts
have been put into the establishment of the Phenol Explorer and
other food content databases (27), our general understanding of
flavanol and polyphenol intake is still limited. Also, the common
approach of estimating intake by combining food intake data
with food content databases is severely limited and not currently
validated by independent (e.g., biomarker-based) means (28).
The current study further underscores that a more detailed,
accurate, quantitative knowledge of individual (poly)phenols is
of importance in predicting potential biological effects of foods
and, thus, in the development of evidence-based nutritional
recommendations.
