Meat consumption providing a surplus
energy in modern diet contributes to
obesity prevalence: an ecological analysis
Wenpeng You1* and Maciej Henneberg1,2
Abstract
Background: Excessive energy intake has been identified as a major contributor to the global obesity epidemic.
However, it is not clear whether dietary patterns varying in their composition of food groups contribute. This study
aims to determine whether differences in per capita availability of the major food groups could explain differences
in global obesity prevalence.
Methods: Country-specific Body Mass Index (BMI) estimates (mean, prevalence of obesity and overweight) were
obtained. BMI estimates were then matched to mean of three year-and country-specific availability of total
kilocalories per capita per day, major food groups (meat, starch, fibers, fats and fruits). The per capita Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) and prevalence of physical inactivity for each country were also obtained. SPSS was used
for log-transformed data analysis.
Results: Spearman analyses of the different major food groups shows that meat availability is most highly
correlated with prevalence of obesity (r = 0.666, p < 0.001) and overweight (r = 0.800, p < 0.001) and mean BMI
(r = 0.656, p < 0.001) and that these relationships remain when total caloric availability, prevalence of physical
inactivity and GDP are controlled in partial correlation analysis. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis indicates
that meat availability is the most significant predictors of prevalence of obesity and overweight and mean BMI
among the food groups. Scatter plot diagrams show meat and GDP adjusted meat are strongly correlated to
obesity prevalence.
Conclusion: High meat availability is correlated to increased prevalence of obesity. Effective strategies to reduce
meat consumption may have differential effects in countries at different stages of the nutrition transition.

Background
The global prevalence of obesity and its associated meta-
bolic syndrome has increased markedly in adults and
children over the past 20 years [1–6]. Once considered a
problem only in high income countries, obesity is now
dramatically on the rise in low- and middle-income
countries, particularly in urban settings. Obesity has
been consider as one of major risk factors for a number
of chronic diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular
diseases and cancer [7]. The World Health Organization
(WHO) describes obesity as one of the most blatantly
visible, yet most neglected, public health problems [8].
Body weight status is determined with reference to the
body mass index (BMI). Those with a BMI ranging be-
tween 18–24.99 kg/m2 are considered healthy. In WHO
statistics, population segment consisting of individuals
with a BMI equal to 25 kg/m2 or higher is classified as
overweight whilst obesity is reserved for those reaching
or exceeding a BMI of 30 kg/m2 [9]. WHO also pub-
lishes the country-level estimate of mean BMI in kg/m2
to reflect its general body weight status.
It is well recognised that diet and lifestyle are the
major contributing
factors, yet previous population
based dietary interventions that focus on one dietary

 factor such as reducing fat intake have been ineffective
in combating the increasing rates of obesity [10–12].
Although energy intake is recognised as a major contrib-
uting factor to the growing obesity rates, there is in-
creasing evidence that some dietary patterns have a
greater influence on promoting body weight gain than
others [13]. Food production modernization and rising
income levels in last decades have made a range of foods
easily available and affordable with less seasonal vari-
ation [14]. To combat obesity a common approach has
been to limit energy intake, although weight loss is often
achieved in the short term, studies are unable to show
that this weight loss is maintained in the long term [15].
Of the food groups, meat when consumed at high levels
has been shown to increase weight gain due to its high
energy density and/or fat content [16–20]. Whether and
how nutrients provided by other food groups contribute
to this effect is not known. In addition, there is little evi-
dence that diet containing different composition of food
groups or macronutrients may also be important in de-
termining the development of obesity, yet this has yet to
be evaluated at the population level.
Our group recently suggested that the portion size of
animal and plant products in the modern diet has con-
tributed to obesity prevalence [21]. People from different
countries have different availability of meat due to their
affordability and dietary habits. We hypothesise that the
persistent consumption of high quantities of meat con-
tributes to increasing adiposity and thus obesity when
carbohydrates and fats consumed are sufficient or over-
abundant to satisfy caloric needs. Here we test this hy-
pothesis using three country specific variables defined by
BMI values (prevalence of obesity and overweight and
mean BMI) and per capita availability data of various
major groups of foodstuffs (meat, starch crop, fruits, fats
and fibers) and the three macronutrients (fats, proteins
and carbohydrates).
Methods
The country specific data were collected for this ecological
study:
The WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO) data
The WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO) data on
estimated prevalence rates of obesity and overweight (per-
cent of population aged 18+ with BMI ≥ 30 and 25 kg/m2
respectively) and on mean BMI of the population aged 18
+ by country was obtained for the year 2010 [22]. We did
not use the most recent version of three levels of BMI
(BMI = 30, BMI = 25 and mean BMI) in 2014, but used
the 2010 year data because of other key variables of inter-
est (described below). We included overweight prevalence
and mean BMI in our study in case meat availability was a
late-stage predictor of obesity.
We also captured the estimated prevalence rate of phys-
ical inactivity for each country for the population aged 18+
[22]. The estimated prevalence rate of physical inactivity is
defined as percent of defined population attaining less than
150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per
week, or less than 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical
activity per week, or equivalent.
The GHO is an initiative of the WHO to share data
on global health, including statistics by country and in-
formation about specific diseases and health measures.
The GHO specifically assembles prevalence data of the
biological risk factors, including obesity, overweight and
mean BMI for WHO Member States using standardized
protocols (http://www.who.int/gho/ncd/methods/en/).
The FAOSTAT Food Balance Sheet (FBS) data
The FAOSTAT Food Balance Sheet (FBS) data on major
food group availability per capita per day of: i) total
meat; ii) starch crops (mixed cereals and starchy root);
iii) fibers (vegetables and pulses); iv) fats (plant oils and
animal fats) and v) fruits [23]. The food items in each
food group are indicated in the Supporting Information
(Additional file 1: Table S1).
We also extracted the availability of grand total calories
and macro-nutrients of fats (animal and plant, in g/capita/
day) and proteins (animal, plant and meat, in g/capita/day)
from FBS for our study. As animal protein includes meat
protein, we subtracted meat protein from the animal pro-
tein to obtain the variable, “Animal protein, excluding meat
protein” for more precise data analysis. Following the
Atwater system [24], we calculated the energy from carbo-
hydrates using the formula: carbohydrates energy per day =
total calories- fat (grand total, in gram/day) × 9 – protein
(total, in gram/day) × 4. For carbohydrates availability in g/
capita/day, we used the energy in kilocalories (kcal) divided
by 4. Because obesity develops after cumulative exposure to
dietary risks (i.e. high intake of risk food groups today does
not lead to immediate obesity, but a prolonged exposure to
high intake of risk food type(s) is required.), we calculated
the mean grams per person per day over a 3-year period
(2007–2009) in each of these food categories to represent
typical long-term exposure to each of these dietary compo-
nents. The rationale for this decision is that studies have
shown that three years is a practical period to develop
metabolic syndrome leading to obesity after exposure to
dietary risks (i.e. high intake of meat today does not lead to
immediate obesity) [25–27]. Using the mean of three years
of nutrients and food groups may also reduce the random
errors during the data collection and calculation by FAO.
The FAOSTAT database disseminates statistical data
collected and maintained by the FAO. FAOSTAT data are
provided as a time-series from 1961 in most domains
through the Food Balance Sheet (FBS, http://faostat3.-
fao.org/home/E). The FBS presents a comprehensive
You and Henneberg BMC Nutrition  (2016) 2:22 
Page 2 of 11
 picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a
specified reference period. The FBS shows for each food
item i.e. each primary commodity availability for human
consumption which corresponds to the sources of supply
and its utilisation. The total quantity of foodstuffs pro-
duced in a country added to the total quantity imported
and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have oc-
curred since the beginning of the reference period gives
the supply available during that period. On the utilisation
side a distinction is made between the quantities exported,
fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and
transportation, and food supplies available for human con-
sumption. The per capita supply of each such food item
available for human consumption is then obtained by div-
iding the respective quantity by the related data on the
population actually partaking in it [28].
Minimum Dietary Energy Requirements, expressed as
kcal per person per day, is the weighted average of the
minimum energy requirements of the different gender-age
groups in the population with light activity. Grantham et
al. reported that when a mixed meal of protein, carbohy-
drate and fat is consumed, carbohydrates and fats are
digested faster and metabolised to satisfy body’s energetic
needs while slower digested protein is ultimately and
stored as fat [29]. Therefore, we extracted the Minimum
Dietary Energy Requirements from the FAO website
(http://www.fao.org/) and compared it and with the en-
ergy from carbohydrates and fats by country to see if the
energy from the proteins is the surplus.
The World Bank data
The World Bank dataset measures progress on aggregate
outcomes for member countries for selected indicators.
GDP PPP is gross domestic product converted to inter-
national dollars using purchasing power parity rates (http://
data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD)
[30].
GDP PPP is the measure of average income in constant
2010 $US adjusted for purchasing power parity for cross-
country comparability.
WHO, FAO and the World Bank are intergovernmen-
tal organizations using specialized information relevant
to their respective fields. Their professional personnel
should have evaluated these data in consideration of
their possible use, e.g. for scientific research and decision
making, before they were published. Therefore, the data
reporting is as free of bias and error as it can be with
government statistics. This means that errors are re-
duced but some inaccuracies related to reporting quality
may still be present in the data. Similar data from the
same sources were recently used to analyse the relation-
ships
between
nutrients
and
obesity
[31,
32]
and
diabetes [33–35] in a number of publications.
We obtained data for 170 countries after we matched
the prevalence estimates of obesity and overweight and
mean BMI to the year-and country-specific food and
other variables. Each country was treated individually as
the subject and all their availability for other variables
information was analysed. The detailed information of
country-level estimates is in the Supporting Information
(Additional file 2: Table S2).
For particular analyses, the number of countries in-
cluded may have differed somewhat because all informa-
tion on other variables was not uniformly available for
all countries due to unavailability from relevant UN
agencies. All the data were extracted and saved in
Microsoft Excel® for analysis. Data sources and summary
statistics are further described in the Supporting Infor-
mation (Additional file 3: Table S3).
Statistical analysis
The prevailing dogma of obesity is that obesity is an af-
fluence related medical conditions [36], which is gener-
ally caused by eating too much (too much calories
intake) [37] and moving too little (physically inactive)
[38]. Therefore, in this study we used GDP PPP, total
calories and prevalence of physical inactivity as the po-
tential confounders and the other variables are divided
into two sets, i.e. major food group and macronutrient
for data analysis in 5 steps.
Spearman rank correlation analyses was used to evalu-
ate the strength and direction of the associations be-
tween food group and macronutrient availability for
consumption and prevalence estimates of overweight
and obesity and mean BMI.
Partial correlation was used to find the unique variance
between each food group and macronutrient and preva-
lence of obesity and overweight and mean BMI respectively
while eliminating the variance from total calories, GDP
PPP and physical inactivity. In order to show the independ-
ent correlation of meat and meat protein to the three vari-
ables defined by BMI (BMI ≥ 30, BMI ≥ 25 and mean BMI)
respectively, we controlled for three potential confounders
(total calories, GDP PPP and physical inactivity) plus all
other food groups and all other macronutrient variables re-
spectively for partial analysis.
Stepwise multiple linear regression modelling was per-
formed to identify and rank predictors (independent var-
iables) of prevalence of obesity, overweight and mean
BMI respectively from two sets of data of food groups
and macronutrients respectively.
Scatter plots were used to explore the relationship be-
tween meat and meat protein (both GDP adjusted) and
three variables defined by BMI. Scatter plots were also used
to explore the relationship between prevalence of obesity
and each food group and macronutrient respectively.
Human diet patterns varying in different food compo-
nents may be affected by the types of food availability in
a particular region, socio-economic status and cultural

like Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) [41], Organ-
isation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) [42], Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
[42], Southern African Development Community (SADC)
[43], the Arab World [42], Latin America (LA), and Asia
Cooperation Dialogue (ACD) [44]. All the country listings
are sourced from their official websites for matching except
LA which is self-classified based on region primarily speak-
ing romance languages. Countries included in LA are listed
in the Supporting Information (Additional file 4: Table S4).
SPSS v. 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago Il USA) was used for
data analysis and the statistical significance was set at the
0.01 level (two-tailed). Prior to analysis data were log-
transformed to bring their distributions close to normal.
Results
Spearman rank correlation analyses of the different major
food groups shows that meat availability is most highly
correlated with prevalence of obesity (r = 0.666, p < 0.001)
and overweight (r = 0.800, p < 0.001) and mean BMI (r =
0.656, p < 0.001) and that these relationships remain when
total caloric availability, prevalence of physical inactivity
and GDP PPP are kept statistically constant in partial cor-
relation analysis (Table 1). Starch crop availability is
strongly in negative correlation with prevalence of obesity
(r = −0.205, p < 0.01) and overweight (r = −0.228, p < 0.01)
and mean BMI (r = −0.318, p < 0.001), but the relationship
does not remain in our partial correlation analysis
(Table 1). Interestingly, in Spearman rank correlation ana-
lyses fats group is second to meat in significant correlation
with prevalence of obesity (r = 0.517, p < 0.001) and

 overweight (r = 0.728, p < 0.001) and mean BMI (r = 0.438,
p < 0.001). However, these relationships nearly disappear
in the succeeding partial correlation analysis with control-
ling for total caloric availability, prevalence of physical in-
activity and GDP (Table 1).
Table 1 also presents the strongest significant correlation
between meat protein availability and prevalence of obesity
(r = 0.673, p < 0.001) and overweight (r = 0.793, p < 0.001)
and mean BMI (r = 0.660, p < 0.001). This correlation is
sustained when total caloric availability, prevalence of phys-
ical inactivity and GDP PPP are kept statistically constant
in partial correlation analysis (Table 1). Animal protein (ex-
cluding meat protein) shows quite high nonparametric
correlation coefficients with prevalence of obesity (r =
0.522, p < 0.001) and overweight (r = 0.741, p < 0.001) and
mean BMI (r = 0.516, p < 0.001), but this correlation is not
sustained in succeeding partial analysis (Table 1). Plant pro-
tein group shows slightly negative correlation with all the
three stages of body weight (BMI ≥ 30, BMI ≥ 25 and mean
BMI) in Spearman rank correlation analyse, but the rela-
tionships are relative strong (not at significance level of p <
0.001 yet) in partial correlation analysis with controlling for
total caloric availability, prevalence of physical inactivity
and GDP (Table 1). Both animal fat and plant oil food types
are correlated with prevalence of obesity (r = 0.581, p <
0.001 and r = 0.440, p < 0.001 respectively) and overweight
(r = 0.803, p < 0.001 and r = 0.570, p < 0.001 respectively)
and mean BMI (r = 0.574, p < 0.001 and r = 0.371, p < 0.001
respectively) in Spearman rank correlation analyses. How-
ever, in the succeeding partial correlation analysis the sig-
nificance either does not remain or becomes weak except
the correlation between animal fats group and prevalence
overweight (r = 0.358, p < 0.001). Carbohydrates energy
shows the relative significant correlation with prevalence of
obesity (r = 0.230, p < 0.01) and overweight (r = 0.202, p <
0.01) and mean BMI (r = 0.208, p < 0.01), but this relation-
ship becomes slightly negative in partial correlation analysis
(Table 1).
Meat and meat protein are in significant correlation
with prevalence of obesity (r = 0.356, p < 0.001 and r =
0.392, p < 0.001 respectively) and overweight (r = 0.421,
p < 0.001 and r = 0.431, p < 0.001 respectively) and mean
BMI (r = 0.380, p < 0.001 and r = 0.400, p < 0.001 respect-
ively) when we control for the potential confounders,
total calories, GDP and physical inactivity in partial ana-
lysis (Table 1). Meat availability is also significantly cor-
related to prevalence of obesity (r = 0.357, p < 0.001) and
overweight (r = 0.415, p < 0.001) and mean BMI (r =
0.339, p < 0.001) when we controlled for the four other
food groups and the three potential confounders in par-
tial correlation. We have the similar correlation of meat
protein to three variables defined by BMI respectively
when we controlled for the other five macronutrients
and the three potential confounders (Table 1).
Table 2 presents that meat and meat protein availabil-
ity are the most significant predictors of prevalence of
obesity (R2 = 0.468 and R2 = 0.472 respectively) and
overweight (R2 = 0.628 and R2 = 0.614 respectively) and
mean BMI (R2 = 0.507 and R2 = 0.498 respectively) when
all food groups and macronutrients were entered into
the regression model respectively for stepwise multiple
linear regression analysis.
The relationship between GDP adjusted meat availabil-
ity and prevalence of obesity and overweight and mean
BMI is noted to be logarithmic with strong correlations
(Fig. 1). Meanwhile relationship between GDP adjusted

 meat protein and the three levels of BMIs shows polyno-
mial relationship with the three variables describing
weight status (Fig. 2).
We also used scatter plots to show the relationship be-
tween prevalence of obesity and each food group and
macronutrient. See the Supporting Information (Additional
file 5: Figures S1 and Additional file 6: S2).
Table 3 shows that generally meat availability is posi-
tively correlated with prevalence of obesity and overweight
and mean BMI can be observed in different country
groupings regardless of cultural backgrounds, economic
levels and geographic locations of the clustered countries.
Based on the WHO region classifications, the positive
correlation is observed in every region except in SEARO.
The correlation between meat availability and three
variables defined by BMI can also be observed in the
country groupings of the Arab World (geographically
scattered in Asia and Africa) and LAC (located in Amer-
icas only) featured with the similar cultures respectively.
The trends also present in two functional alliances,
OECD and APEC although the former comprises devel-
oped countries only and the latter is comprised of both
developing and developed countries.
We subtracted grand total protein energy from grand
total calories to allow us to obtain the energy from grand
total fats and carbohydrates in kcal/capita/day [28],
which is more than the minimum dietary energy re-
quirements in all countries except Haiti (−29.3 kcal/
capita/day) and Zambia (−90.9 kcal/capita/day).
Discussion
The worldwide secular trend of increased obesity preva-
lence likely has multiple aetiologies, which may act through
multiple mechanisms. By examining the per capita avail-
ability of the major food groups and macronutrients for
170 countries we have shown that populations with the
highest availability levels of meat (meat protein) have the
highest prevalence of overweight and obesity and greatest
mean BMI. Meat is most significant predictor of prevalence
of obesity and overweight and mean BMI at country level,
and this relationship is independent of total calories avail-
ability, GDP and prevalence of physical inactivity. Our find-
ing of the relationship between meat availability and body
weight increase is consistent with data from Belgium [45]
and USA [46–48] that showed a positive association be-
tween obesity prevalence among adults and children and
meat consumption. Studies in China also showed that high
intakes of meat products, including red meat were associ-
ated with the prevalence of obesity [49, 50]. A survey in
Ireland showed that young girls avoided meat because they

 concluded that “‘meat is a fattening food” [51]. The associ-
ation for the Chinese population is particularly striking as
the changes in dietary patterns and obesity rates have oc-
curred very rapidly [52]. All these studies based on the indi-
vidual level held the view that fat in meat contributed to
obesity or body weight increase even though fresh meat has
been leaner than ever over the past few decades due to lea-
ner animals being bred and improved butchery and feeding
techniques that make fat content fall significantly [53, 54].
The correlation we found in this study between the three
major macronutrients or their proxy food groups and three
variables defined by BMI is compatible with Grantham et
al.’s finding that, in modern diet, carbohydrates and fats are
digested to satisfy body’s energetic needs while protein is
converted and stored as fat [29].
The human metabolic system has been adapting to
forager diet for millions of years [55], and adaptations to
an agriculture-based diet only started a few thousand
years ago in most populations [29, 56]. An evolutionary
mismatch between modern dietary constituents and the
food available prior to the agricultural revolution has
long been considered a factor in the obesity epidemic
[57]. In the Palaeolithic age our ancestors’ diet com-
prised of what could be extracted from natural environ-
ments through gathering, scavenging and hunting and
thus predominately consisted of animal protein [58]. In
addition to hunting large animals, the main food sources
included smaller animals such as amphibians, reptiles,
invertebrates and their eggs, but also plant products,
such as tubers, fruits and nuts that could be collected
seasonally. In general, there was limited availability of
animal and plant food, but plant sources were often least
available [21]. Fats do not occur in large quantities in
plants or wild animals. In the foraging situation ingested
protein was mainly used for energy production as avail-
able carbohydrates from plants would be too scarce to
satisfy human energy needs [55]. This use of protein was
possible as humans have efficient deaminases that can
convert amino acids to carbon skeletons that, when
broken down to pyruvate can be processed in the citric
acid cycle, or de novo lipogenesis, or gluconeogenesis
[21]. Occasionally, when there was an abundant meat
source, e.g. a large mammal, surplus ingested protein
was efficiently stored in the human body as adipose tis-
sue [59]. Thus the human metabolic system has evolved
over thousands of years to predominately rely on animal
protein and to a lesser degree carbohydrate and fats to sat-
isfy our energy needs and to store surplus food intake into
the adipose tissue [21]. Further support of human adapta-
tion and dependence on protein for energy, comes from
similarities in total energy intake (standardised by body
mass) and intestinal tract morphology between modern
humans and extant carnivores [21].
In the current study animal products provided less than
half (3.1–44.5 %) of the individual daily energy require-
ment for all countries examined [23], and a majority of en-
ergy came from plant products. Interestingly, there are a
number of different weight loss diets that are high in ani-
mal and low in plant products such as the Atkins
Nutritional Approach [60–62]. Although these diets can
be effective in reducing weight in the short term, energy
restriction is difficult to maintain long term and a majority
of people regain any weight that was lost [15]. Daily en-
ergy requirements of modern humans may be quickly and

 easily satisfied by digesting plant products rich in carbohy-
drates [21, 29, 50] whereas consumed concurrently animal
products, including meat that are more costly and slower
to digest, will be metabolised into fat and stored [21]. The
FAO/WHO currently recommends that our dietary pro-
tein should make up 10–15 percent of calorie intake [63].
It has been reported that consuming an amount of protein
above the FAO/WHO recommendation may be deleteri-
ous for weight maintenance through adult life [64]. In
support of this, the PANACEA project which used data
from the EPIC cohort [65] showed that participants con-
suming more than 22 % of energy from protein had 23–
24 % higher risk of becoming overweight or obese than
participants consuming a diet low in protein (≤14 %) [65].
Additionally, a 5 % higher proportion of protein at the ex-
pense of carbohydrates was associated with a 247 g weight
gain in men (95 % CI = (160,334)) and a 388 g weight gain
(296,480) in women after 5 years [65]. Furthermore, in-
creasing the proportion of fat by 5 % at the expense of
carbohydrates during the same period showed no associ-
ation with body weight increase [65].
Experiments among young males and rats undertaken
by Mikkelsen et al. [66] and Toden et al. [67] respect-
ively did not show the high meat protein quantity was
associated with body weight increase. The underlying
reasons may be that the used diets contained too much
meat protein which was over FAO/WHO recommended
level and/or that these experiments focused on one or
two sources of proteins, which did not reflect the actual
protein metabolism within human body. Two case con-
trolled studies have shown that adults and children con-
suming vegetarian diets have lower BMI values and a
lower prevalence of obesity [68, 69]. A medical and per-
formance testing of 46,684 Swiss showed that obesity
rates were also markedly lower in vegetarian adults [29]
and epidemiological studies have consistently shown that
vegetarians are thinner than comparable non-vegetarians
[70]. A meta-analysis of adult vegetarian diet studies es-
timated a reduced weight difference of 7.6 kg for men
and 3.3 kg for women, which resulted in a 2-point lower
BMI [68]. Although there are some animal data suggest-
ing that diets low in protein may increase the prevalence
of obesity [71], evolutionary differences between humans
and other animal species may explain our different
metabolic response to dietary protein [72]. Rats [73] and
mice [74] model experiments have shown that dairy pro-
tein rich diet reduces adiposity, which might be inter-
preted that the associations between dairy protein and
overweight and obesity are not as strong as meat protein
in this study. Our results show animal protein (excluding
meat protein) is associated with the three stages of
BMIs, but not as significantly as meat protein does may
be because protein from dairy [73] and fish products
[75] don’t contribute to body weight increase.
There is a growing body of evidence which suggests that
increased plant protein intakes are protective of body
weight gain. A longitudinal association study in the US
showed that people with the highest levels of plant protein
intake had a reduced risk of being obese [48]. A similar as-
sociation was found in the Belgian population using a food
consumption survey [45]. These findings are consistent
with the current study which showed that plant protein
consumption rates were inversely associated with preva-
lence of both overweight and obesity [50] and mean BMI.
Plant and meat protein may have different effects on body
weight [48] because of their differences in amino acid com-
position [76]. Generally, dietary plant protein in food is
mixed with indigestible carbohydrate (fiber) that can reduce
plant protein digestibility. Therefore, plant protein varies in
its digestibility and may provide considerably less energy
compared to meat proteins.
The current study shows an inverse association be-
tween starch food group (mixed cereals and starchy

 root) and carbohydrates availability and prevalence of
overweight and obesity and mean BMI. Cereals and
starchy roots are grown in greater quantities and provide
more food energy worldwide than any other type of
crop. Carbohydrates are not an essential nutrient in
humans [77, 78] even though they are a common source
of energy. For instance, carbohydrate content in foods
provide 70 percent or more of the energy intake of the
population in the developing countries and about 40
percent in the United States and Europe [79]. Humans
are the only large mammal that derives a majority of its
energy by absorbing and metabolising carbohydrate. Be-
cause carbohydrate metabolism primarily concentrates
on the oxidation of carbohydrates in the direct produc-
tion of energy, this rarely produces fat [77, 80].
Our results show that both plant oils and animal fats
are significantly associated with mean BMI, overweight
and obesity in Spearman analysis, but the significance of
this relationship disappears or is reduced because we
controlled for total calories, GDP and prevalence of
physical inactivity in partial correlation analysis. Numer-
ous studies have shown increased intakes of dietary fat
increase obesity risk/development [81–85]. However, a
causal relationship between fat intake and obesity preva-
lence based on these studies [86–88] is difficult to dem-
onstrate. Furthermore, the third American National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey showed that
in the past two decades in United States, the prevalence
of obesity has increased whereas the fat consumption
was reduced [89, 90]. Therefore, the increase in obesity
cannot be explained by changes in dietary fat alone.
A strength of this study is that we used per capita
availability data from 170 countries which enabled us to
examine relationships in food group and macronutrient
intake and how they may explain differences in the rates
of prevalence of obesity and overweight and mean BMI
at population level. However, there are several limita-
tions in this study. Firstly, although we attempted to re-
move confounding effects of variables such as GDP,
caloric etc. by means of partial correlation analysis, some
confounding factors may still influence correlation we
found. Secondly, there may be some variables not in-
cluded in our analysis that influence the correlation
found in this study. It is however difficult to see what
such variables may be. Thirdly, we could only use an
international food database that tracks the general mar-
ket availability of different food types, not the actual hu-
man consumption. There are no direct measures of actual
human consumption that can account for food wastage
and provide precise measures of food consumption inter-
nationally. Fourthly, we were unable to analyze associations
of food groups with obesity by each individual food item at
country level. One of the main reasons is that some country
may not access some particular food item due to its
availability in their region, socio-economic status or cultural
beliefs. For instance, pig meat (pork) is not consumed in
Muslim countries or less consumed in countries with
Muslim population, but they consumed mutton and lamp
and other animal meat which share similar nutritional
properties. Finally, the data analysed are calculated per
capita in each country, so we can only demonstrate a rela-
tionship between food group availability and obesity, over-
weigh and mean BMI at a country level, which does not
necessarily correspond to the same relationships holding
true at the individual level. Prospective cohort studies are
proposed to explore these associations further.
Conclusion
By examining the per capita availability of macronutri-
ents and the major food groups for 170 countries we are
able to identify that countries with dietary patterns that
are higher in meat have greater rates of obesity and
overweight and higher mean BMI. Considering the find-
ings of adverse effect of obesity on the risk of other
chronic diseases revealed by other studies as well as the
environmental impact of meat production, the country
authorities may advise people not to adopt a high-meat
diet for long-term healthy weight management.
