Diabetes Care 2017;40:1218–1225 | https://doi.org/10.2337/dc17-0310
OBJECTIVE
Rigorousevidenceislackingwhetheronlinegamescan improve patients’ longer-term
health outcomes. We investigated whether an online team-based game delivering
diabetes self-management education (DSME) to patients via e-mail or mobile appli-
cation (app) can generate longer-term improvements in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Patients (n = 456) on oral diabetes medications with HbA1c ‡58 mmol/mol were
randomly assigned between a DSME game (with a civics booklet) and a civics game
(with a DSME booklet). The 6-month games sent two questions twice weekly via
e-mail or mobile app. Participants accrued points based on performance, with scores
posted on leaderboards. Winning teams and individuals received modest financial
rewards. Our primary outcome measure was HbA1c change over 12 months.
RESULTS
DSME game patients had significantly greater HbA1c reductions over 12 months than
civics game patients (28 mmol/mol [95% CI 210 to 27] and 25 mmol/mol [95%
CI 27 to 23], respectively; P = 0.048). HbA1c reductions were greater among patients
with baseline HbA1c >75 mmol/mol: 216 mmol/mol [95% CI 221 to 212] and 29
mmol/mol [95% CI 214 to 25] for DSME and civics game patients, respectively;
P = 0.031.
CONCLUSIONS
Patients with diabetes who were randomized to an online game delivering DSME
demonstrated sustained and meaningful HbA1c improvements. Among patients with
poorly controlled diabetes, the DSME game reduced HbA1c by a magnitude compa-
rable to starting a new diabetes medication. Online games may be a scalable ap-
proach to improve outcomes among geographically dispersed patients with diabetes
and other chronic diseases.
Diabetes self-management education (DSME) is a core component of comprehensive
quality care of type 2 diabetes (1,2). There is consensus on the appropriate DSME
curricular elements (3) but not necessarily how it should be delivered. DSME can
generate short-term (,6 months) positive effects on glucose control, but these early
gains often dissipate quickly (4–8). A meta-analysis showed that two-thirds of hemo-
globin A1c (HbA1c) change attributable to DSME is lost in the 1–3 months after
completion (9).

EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND THERAPEUTICS
 A novel form of online education
(termed “spaced education” [SE]) based
on two robust psychological phenomena
(the spacing and testing effects) can im-
prove long-term retention of learning and
generate meaningful behavior change
(10–12). Delivered via e-mail or mobile
application (app), SE presents clinical
case scenarios accompanied by multiple-
choice questions. Participantsare asked to
submit answers and are then immediately
presented with the correct answer(s)
and an explanation ofthetopic. The mate-
rial is represented in a cycled pattern to
reinforce the content over weeks and
months. We have shown in randomized
trials involving health care providers that
the SE methodology improves knowledge
acquisition, boosts learning retention for
up to 2 years, and durably improves clin-
ical performance (13–18).
We recently incorporated several
game mechanics into SE, including com-
petition among participants and adaptive
content delivery that is modified based on
a participant’s past performance. Team-
based competition within SE games gen-
erates significantly stronger engagement
among participants (19), and an SE game
delivered to clinicians led to significantly
improved health measures of their pa-
tients (20).
In this study, we hypothesized that a
team-based SE game on DSME topics de-
livered to patients with type 2 diabetes
could generate sustained improvements
in their HbA1c. To test this, we conducted
a randomized trial with an active control
group among veterans with diabetes liv-
ing in the eastern U.S.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Design Overview
This study was a randomized controlled
trial of an online SE game among patients
with diabetes. The study received institu-
tional review board approval and was reg-
isteredatClinicalTrials.gov(NCT02082704).
Setting and Participants
The study was conducted from July
2014 to June 2015 among Veterans Af-
fairs (VA) patients in the eastern U.S.
We targeted for participation patients
with diabetes who had inadequate glu-
cose control while taking oral diabetes
medications, with or without the con-
comitant use of insulin, to study if the
DSME game would lower HbA1c via im-
proved medication adherence. Pharmacy
and laboratory data were reviewed for
patients with 1) an active prescription
for oral diabetes medications as of De-
cember 2013 and 2) whose most recent
HbA1c in 2013 was .64 mmol/mol as
measured by an in-hospital laboratory.
These veterans were solicited via letter
and telephone. They asked to enroll by
responding affirmatively over the phone
or returned a card via mail. Those pa-
tients who subsequently provided an
e-mail address, completed an online
survey, submitted an HbA1c home test
kit (Home Access Inc., Hoffman Estates,
IL), and had a home-tested HbA1c value
of $58 mmol/mol were included in the
study.
Development and Validation of
SE Game Content
The educational content for the SE game
was structured in single or multiple cor-
rect answer question-explanation format
to take advantage of the testing effect.
Fifty questions-explanations were devel-
oped on the topics of DSME and civics.
The DSME content focused on glucose
management, exercise, long-term diabe-
tes complications, medication adherence,
and nutrition. The civics content was
derived from the U.S. Citizenship and
Immigration Services Practice Test
(https://my.uscis.gov/prep/test/civics).
Questions were independently content
validated by two diabetes specialists,
one primary care physician, and one
physician-educator. They were then
pilot tested among 30 patients with dia-
betes, and specific questions were se-
lected for inclusion based on item
difficulty, point-biserial correlation, and
Kuder-Richardson 20 score. Detailed ex-
planations to accompany each question
were constructed to explain the answers,
provide a take-home message, and pro-
vide references for the content material.
Structure and Rules of the Game
The game used an automated system
(Qstream Inc., Burlington, MA) that sent
two questions every Tuesday and Thurs-
day to participants via e-mail or mobile
app from July to December 2014. Upon
answering the multiple-choice question,
the patient was immediately presented
with the correct answer and a detailed
explanation of the question content (Fig.
1). After a question was first presented
(round 1), it was sent again 4 weeks later
to reinforce learning points (round 2) via
the spacing effect. If the question was
answered incorrectly in round 1 but cor-
rectly in round 2, patients were given the
opportunity to receive the question again
2 weeks later in a bonus round. Points
were earned based on performance on
the questions. Patients were assigned to
one of seven teams based on their geo-
graphic region. To foster a sense of com-
petition and community, individual and
team scores were posted on leader-
boards. To protect patients’ identities,
each was assigned an alias. Team scores
were calculated as the average score ofall
of its members. In addition, patients were
shown how others had answered each
question and how many had answered
it correctly. Although rewards were
structured to take advantage of the dem-
onstrated efficacy of group-based finan-
cial incentives (21), we also included
individual-based awards to maintain en-
gagement among participants on lower-
performing teams. At the end of the
game, all members of the two teams with
the most points in each arm received a
$100 gift certificate to an online store. In
addition, the top 30% of individual patients
on the remaining teams in each arm re-
ceived a $100 gift certificate.
Randomization and Interventions
Patients were stratified by home-tested
HbA1c level ($69 vs. ,69 mmol/mol)
and pill possession ratio (PPR) ($0.60
or ,0.60) and block randomized at a
single time point into two arms (block
size = 4) using a random allocation se-
quence (22). All patients began the study
simultaneously in July 2014. We provided
the identical curricula (DSME and civics)
toallparticipants with only the method of
delivery differing between arms (Fig. 2).
Patients in the DSME arm received the SE
game on DSME and a paper booklet con-
taining the question-explanation materials
oncivics.Patientsinthecivicsarmreceived
the SE game on civics and a paper booklet
containing the question-explanation mate-
rials on DSME.
Clinical Data Sources
At enrollment and at 6 and 12 months
after the launch of the game, patients
were sent a home test kit and asked to
return a fingerstick blood sample blotted
on filter paper and urine specimen by
mail. These specimens were assayed
by a commercial laboratory for HbA1c (co-
efficient of variation: 3.0–3.9%), urine al-
bumin, and urine creatinine (Home
Access Inc.). Patient information was

 withheld from the outside laboratory
through use of coded identifiers. In addi-
tion, patients completed two online
questionnaires: an 8-item Diabetes Em-
powerment Scale (DES) Short Form (23)
and 20-item Problem Areas in Diabetes
(PAID) questionnaire (24), at baseline,
6 months, and 12 months. Patients were
sent a $75 gift certificate at each of these
time points. Additional clinical data were
extracted from the VA Corporate Data
Warehouse.
Outcomes Measures
Our primary outcome measure was the level
of HbA1c over time. Secondary outcome
measures included PPR of oral diabe-
tes medications, urine microalbumin-to-
creatinine ratio, and DES and PAID scores.
Statistical Analysis
Enrolling 450 participants provided 0.8
power to detect a 4 mmol/mol difference
in HbA1c between arms at a two-sided
0.05 significance level, assuming an SD
of 14 mmol/mol.
PPR was generated for oral diabetes
medications during the intervention and
follow-up periods and was calculated by
taking the total number of day’s supply
that the patient received over the course
of the study, including any fills that over-
lapped the beginning or end of the study
period, divided by the time between the
first fill date and the fill date of the first
prescription outside of the study period.
If the patient was on multiple diabetes
drugs, PPRs were averaged across drugs
taken in the same study period. Charlson
comorbidity indices, Elixhauser comorbid-
ity indices, and Diabetes Complications
Severity Scale scores were calculated us-
ing ICD-9 coding algorithms (25–27).
Generalized estimating equations with
unstructured correlation matrices were
used to examine the association between
arm and time with each of the outcomes.
The urine microalbumin-to-creatinine ra-
tio was log transformed for the analysis.
Intent-to-treat analyses were conducted
for the entire study population. For each
arm, the generalized estimating equa-
tion models estimated mean outcome
values as well as mean change in values.
Pairwise comparisons were made be-
tween arms using the contrast/estimate
statements in PROC GENMOD (SAS Insti-
tute Inc., Cary, NC). In these analyses,
we assumed an ignorable missing data
situation (“missing completely at ran-
dom”) (28,29) and performed the analysis
with an unbalanced design using all avail-
able information.
As there was missing outcome data at
the 6- and 12-month assessment times,
we used mixed linear regression models
to explore the associations under a
Figure 1—Example of DSME game content. The patient was presented with a multiple-choice
question (A). Upon submitting an answer, the patient was immediately presented with the correct
answer and a detailed explanation of the question content (B). After a question was first presented
(round 1),it was sentagain 4 weeks latertoreinforce learning points(round2)via the spacing effect.
Points were earned based on performance on each question (photo from iStock; istockphoto.com).

 “missing at random” assumption.Wealso
used these models to assess the role of
“team” as a random effect, to compare
models with fixed sample return times
(baseline, 6 months, and 12 months) ver-
sus actual sample return times, and to
compare models with various spatial cor-
relations versus a simple unstructured
correlation. Given that the adjusted
mixed-model HbA1c outcomes were simi-
lar to those from the initial unadjusted
generalized estimating equation model,
we present the results of our outcome
measures from the initial unadjusted
model.Inadditiontotheprespecifiedanal-
yses, we also present several post hoc
analyses to explore possible explanations
for observed associations. Post hoc linear
regression models were used to obtain
correlations between change in DES score,
PAID score, and points achieved during the
game as predictors of change in HbA1c val-
ues by study arm. As these were not pre-
planned analyses, we emphasize the
exploratory nature of these results. Data
were managed using Microsoft SQL Server
Management Studio 2014 and Microsoft
Excel 2010. All analyses were conducted
with SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc.) at the
a = 0.05 significance level.
RESULTS
Of 15,455 potentially eligible patients who
were contacted, 2,300 (15%) requested to
enroll.Amongthese,456(20%)completed
the enrollment process, met the inclusion
criteria, and were randomized to DSME
and civics game arms (227 and 229 patients,
respectively) (Supplementary Fig. 1). De-
mographic characteristics of randomized
patients were similar between arms (Ta-
ble 1). Thegamewasstartedby227(100%)
and 225 (98%) of DSME and civics game
patients, respectively, with 213 (94%) and
207 (90%) submitting responses to all
50 questions.
Primary Outcome
Over the 12 months of the study, DSME
game patients had significantly greater
reductions in mean HbA1c than civics
game patients (28 mmol/mol [95%
CI 210 to 26] and 25 mmol/mol [95%
CI 27 to 23], respectively; P = 0.048),
with the difference between cohorts
manifesting primarily in the 6 months af-
ter the games (Fig. 3 and Table 2). Results
were similar when adjusting for team and
missing data (28 mmol/mol [95% CI 210
to 26] and 25 mmol/mol [95% CI 27
to 23], respectively; P = 0.051) (Table 2).
Secondary Outcomes
Baseline HbA1c values were higher among
those with lower DSME knowledge, as
measured by their initial answers to the
DSME game questions (b = 20.19, P =
0.005). In contrast, reductions in HbA1c
over the trial were not significantly associ-
ated with improvement in DSME knowl-
edge over the course of the game (as
measured by final score adjusting for base-
line score), with patients’ engagement in
the game (as measured by the number of
questions answered), and their overall
performance on the game (as measured
by game points).
Empowerment (as measured by DES)
increased among the DSME game patients

 in the 6-month intervention period (+1.7
[95% CI 0.7 to 2.7]), whereas that of the
civics patients decreased (20.1 [95%
CI 21.1 to 0.8], respectively; P = 0.010).
There were also greater reductions in di-
abetes distress (as measured by PAID)
among DSME game patients during the
intervention period, but this difference
was not statistically significant. During
the 6-month follow-up period and the
12-month study overall, changes in em-
powerment and distress scores did not
differ significantly between arms.
Changesin PPRand urinemicroalbumin-
to-creatinine ratio during the intervention
and follow-up periods showed no sig-
nificant differences by arm. Similarly,
there was no significant difference be-
tween arms in the number of diabetes
medications started or discontinued
during the intervention and follow-up
periods.
Post Hoc Analyses
In patients with baseline HbA1c levels
.75 mmol/mol, HbA1c reductions over
the 12 months were significantly greater
among DSME game patients than among
civics game patients (216 mmol/mol [95%
CI 221 to 212] and 29 mmol/mol [95%
CI 214 to 25], respectively; P = 0.031)
(Fig. 3). Among DSME game patients,
the number of points earned during
the game (mean 14,118 [SD 2,122])
correlated significantly with increases in
empowerment (mean 1.12 [SD 7.79], R2 =
0.029, P = 0.017), but there was no signif-
icant correlation between this increase in
empowerment and improvements in
HbA1c.
CONCLUSIONS
Our results show that an SE game deliv-
ering DSME content to patients with di-
abetes over a broad geographic area
generates short-term increases in patient
empowerment and longer-term improve-
ments in HbA1c, compared with a control
intervention (civics game and paper-
based DSME). Among DSME game pa-
tients with elevated HbA1c at baseline
(.75 mmol/mol), the overall reduction
in HbA1c is comparable to that of starting
a new diabetes medication (30,31). In
aggregate, our study provides rigorous
evidence that an online game admin-
istered among patients with diabetes
can generate meaningful and sus-
tained improvements in their glucose
control.
It is noteworthy that the greatest im-
pact of the DSME game on HbA1c was
seen in the 6 months after completing
the game. This delayed impact may be
due to the time lag between the gradual
adoptionofappropriatehealth-improving
behaviors inducedbytheDSME game and
the glycemic improvements eventually
reflected in HbA1c. By its very nature,
the spacing effect requires learning to
be distributed over spaced intervals of
time. Educational programs structured
to take advantage of the spacing effect
have been shown to generate knowledge
and skills that are retained more effec-
tively over time, but this SE learning pro-
cess is gradual (13,15).
Our initial hypothesis was that HbA1c
would be impacted via increased adher-
ence to oral diabetes medications, but
this was not supported by our find-
ings. The DSME game may have affected
longer-term glucose control via lifestyle
changes such as exercise and nutrition,
but we did not capture these data from
patients. In future research, mobile apps
to track lifestyle changes used in combi-
nation with the DSME game may help de-
fine the role of exercise and nutrition in
the longer-term HbA1c changes we ob-
served (32). The financial incentives

 were similar in both arms and thus were
unlikely to have caused the differential
benefit on HbA1c. In an attempt to eluci-
date other potential mechanisms of ac-
tion, we performed several exploratory
analyses. The number of points earned
in the DSME game, which reflects pa-
tients’ engagement with the game as
well as their baseline and acquired
DSME knowledge, had a small but signif-
icant correlation with changes in em-
powerment. We also noted a significant
increase in empowerment among DSME
game patients during the intervention
period that preceded their significant
improvement in HbA1c but could not
demonstrate a significant relationship be-
tween this increase in empowerment and
improvements in HbA1c.
Of note, the control group also sus-
tained substantial reductions in HbA1c.
This is not unexpected based on our prior
research showing that DSME booklets
can significantly improve HbA1c over
12 months (33). These HbA1c changes
may also reflect an observation effect
caused by game participation, regression
to the mean, and/or patients’ engage-
ment in virtual communities generated
through the team-based competition.
These findings highlight the importance
of including an adequately designed
control group to clarify the true impact
of patient-directed interventions.
As technology has advanced over the
last 2 decades, multiple attempts have
been made to harness interactive com-
putergamestoimproveself-management
of patients with diabetes, shifting from
CD-ROMs to game consoles (e.g., PlaySta-
tion; Sony Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) to
the Internet (34). Overall, data supporting
the efficacy of these interventions are ex-
tremely limited (35). Most studies focus
on collecting information on user experi-
ence, frequently lack a control group, and
fail to assess longer-term outcomes.
Among randomized trials of computer-
based DSME interventions that do assess
longer-term outcomes, a recent meta-
analysis found that there was no signifi-
cant difference in HbA1c between study
armswhenpatientsweretested6months
or more after the interventions (36).
Similarly, a meta-analysis of game-based
interventions for patients with diabetes
found only three studies that were of suf-
ficient methodologic rigor for inclusion,
and these games showed no effect on
HbA1c compared with control subjects
(37).
Our study has a number of strengths,
including the novelty of the game-based
intervention, a focus on longer-term
health outcomes, geographic diversity of
the patient population, and a study design
that doubly controlled for game participa-
tion and content exposure. In addition, our
study was conducted remotely without re-
quiring physical contact with patients and
used in-home testing and administrative
data for outcome assessments, providing
evidence for scalability of such interven-
tions to larger patient populations and
health care systems. One benefit of the
SEmethodology isthatparticipantsmerely
require a computer or mobile device with
an Internet connection. Such an interven-
tion could be deployed in geographically
dispersed and remote health care settings
(38). We are developing an implementa-
tion strategy to deploy the DSME game
initially inthe VANew England Healthcare
System and then to expand across the
Veterans Health Administration.
Our findings must also beconsidered in
the context of several limitations. Enroll-
ment in the trial required Internet and
e-mailaccess, thereby enriching the study
with patients who are comfortable us-
ing technology. This may limit its gener-
alizability, as may the predominantly
male veteran population from which we
recruited. Although a small percentage of
the eligible patients who were contacted
wanted toenrollandfewerwere random-
ized, these participation rates are consis-
tent with both our prior studies and with
real-world experience with recruiting par-
ticipants into weight loss and diabetes
prevention programs (39–41). We were
not able to reliably assess the degree to
which patients engaged with the paper-
based DSME materials and thus cannot
determine if and how this impacted
HbA1c levels among the civics game par-
ticipants. The between-group difference
in HbA1c is significant but small, albeit
this improvement is considered at the
threshold of clinical significance by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (42).
In addition, we collected limited outcome
data from study participants, and these
did not provide evidence of a clear mech-
anism to explain the effects of the inter-
vention. Finally, we do not have health
outcomes data beyond 12 months, so
we cannotdeterminethe degreetowhich
the improvements in HbA1c are durable.
Further research is needed to determine if
and how such games can maintain or in-
crease improvements in HbA1c over time.
In summary, our randomized trial dem-
onstrates that an SE game delivering

Generalized estimating equation models estimated mean outcome values aswell asmean change in
values. Pairwise comparisons were made between arms using the contrast/estimate statements in
PROC GENMOD (SAS Institute Inc.). In these analyses, we assumed an ignorable missing data
situation (“missing completely at random”) (24,25) and performed the analysis with an unbalanced
design using all available information. Results from the unadjusted generalized estimating equation
model and adjusted mixed model are presented. For the latter, we performed mixed linear
regression models to explore the associations under a “missing at random” assumption and to
assess the role of “team” as a random effect. *P , 0.05 prior to rounding.

 DSME content generates significant im-
provements in HbA1c over 12 months
among patients with diabetes. This meth-
odology may be an effective and scalable
method by which to improve health out-
comesin patientswithdiabetesandother
chronic diseases.
