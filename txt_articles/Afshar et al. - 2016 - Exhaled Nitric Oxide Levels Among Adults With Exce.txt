BACKGROUND: More than one-quarter of the US population qualify as excessive alcohol
consumers. Alcohol use impacts several lung diseases, and heavy consumption has been
associated with poor clinical outcomes. The fractional excretion of exhaled nitric oxide
(FENO) has clinical implications in multiple airways diseases. We hypothesized that excessive
alcohol intake is associated with lower FENO levels.
METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we examined a sample consisting of 12,059 participants,
aged 21 to 79 years, interviewed between 2007 and 2012 from the National Health and
Examination Survey. Two valid FENO measurements that were reproducible were recorded.
Alcohol questionnaire data were used to define the following alcohol groups: never drinkers,
nonexcessive drinkers, excessive drinkers, and former excessive drinkers. The natural loga-
rithm of FENO values [ln(FENO)] as well as blood eosinophil count and C-reactive protein were
used as dependent variables to test the association with alcohol groups including multivar-
iable linear regression models with adjustment for predictors of FENO.
RESULTS: Excessive alcohol consumption comprised 3,693 (26.9%) of the US sample popu-
lation. Controlling for all other factors, excessive alcohol consumption had a negative
association and was an independent predictor for ln(FENO) levels in comparison with the
never-drinker group (�0.11; 95% CI, �0.17 to �0.06; P < .001). ln(FENO) levels decreased
across categories of increasing alcohol use (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Accounting for alcohol use in the interpretation of FENO levels should be an
additional consideration, and further investigations are warranted to explore the complex
interaction between alcohol and nitric oxide in the airways.

 Fractional excretion of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) is a
simple, noninvasive measurement of nitric oxide in an
exhaled breath that has been commonly used as a
biomarker of eosinophilic airway inflammation in
patients with asthma.1,2 In addition, the American
Thoracic Society has recommended that FENO levels in
patients with asthma be used to determine corticosteroid
responsiveness and compliance.3 Use of FENO has
expanded to several other applications in pulmonary
diseases including corticosteroid responsiveness in
COPD, diagnosing primary ciliary dyskinesia, and
treatment responses in pulmonary artery hypertension
and cystic fibrosis.4-7 Nitric oxide is an important
gaseous mediator, synthesized by the nitric oxide
synthase (NOS) family of enzymes, that is involved
in regulating several lung physiologic and pathologic
processes. Whereas nitric oxide can arise from
multiple anatomic locations in the lungs, FENO levels
are currently thought to represent predominantly
production from airway epithelial cells via nitric
oxide synthase 2 (NOS2; inducible NOS).4,8,9 The
effect of alcohol use on FENO levels has not been
investigated, but this information might be important
because alcohol use impacts several lung diseases
and could thereby influence the interpretation and
application of FENO measurements and the usefulness
of the assay.
Heavy alcohol consumption impairs lung defenses,
as reflected in the well-recognized association of
alcoholism and pneumonia.10 However, alcohol can
have positive effects and was used historically to treat
asthma and a variety of lung diseases.11 Pure ethanol
can act as a bronchodilator in humans11 and has
been shown to reduce allergic asthma in mice.12 On
the other hand, nonalcohol components within alcoholic
beverages such as sulfites, phenolic compounds/
resveratrol (inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-1), wheat/
gluten, and hop content can act as potential triggers
of asthma.13-15 The Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III; 1994)
data set demonstrated an increased risk for airflow
obstruction in former excessive alcohol consumers,
independent of potential confounders.16 Interestingly,
there was a reduction in the risk for lung restriction
in this group.16
We hypothesize that alcohol is an important predictor
of FENO, with reduced levels being observed in excessive
alcohol consumers. This hypothesis is based on the
observation that intravenous alcohol reduces exhaled
nitric oxide in anesthetized rabbits17 and, moreover,
modest alcohol consumption reduces exhaled nitric
oxide in subjects with asthma, but not normal subjects.18
Information regarding the effect of alcohol on FENO
levels might be important in the interpretation and
therapeutic considerations in subjects with risky
alcohol consumption and respiratory disease and/or
provide insight into potential mechanisms of alcohol
effects in the lung.
Methods
Study Population and Inclusion Criteria
NHANES is a nationally representative cross-sectional survey designed
to
assess
the
health
and
nutritional
status
of
the
civilian,
noninstitutionalized
US
population.
The
survey
is
conducted
annually
using
stratified
multistage
probability
sampling
to
provide estimates of the US population. Household interviews
were performed in person and standardized health measurements
were performed in a mobile examination center. Samples are
weighted on the basis of age, sex, race, and ethnicity to represent the
distribution of the US population. Beginning in 2007, NHANES
expanded
to
include
FENO
measurements.
We
analyzed
data
beginning in 2007 through the last available public use data files
released in 2012.
Participants 21 years of age or older with demographic data, alcohol
questionnaire data, and completed FENO testing were included in the
analysis. The age cutoff was chosen on the basis of the legal US
drinking age and to reduce bias in survey response from those below
the legal drinking age. Pregnant participants were excluded from
analysis. Additional data collected for analysis included C-reactive
protein (CRP) level and peripheral blood eosinophil count to
represent systemic inflammation. All participants provided written
consent, and the National Center for Health Statistics Research
Ethics Review Board approved all protocols.
Exhaled Nitric Oxide
A US Food and Drug Administration-approved, portable, hand-held
nitric oxide analyzer (Aerocrine NIOX MINO) was used with
automated prompts and coaching by health technicians. Subjects
were allowed 10 attempts to meet the NHANES protocol for two
valid FENO measurements that were reproducible, in accordance with
the testing procedures recommended by the manufacturer and
similar to those published by the American Thoracic Society and
European
Respiratory
Society.3
The
device
uses
an
online
chemiluminescence analyzer to provide measurements between 5 and
300 parts per billion (ppb). Participants with FENO results below the
level of detection (5 ppb) comprised 922 (6.27%) of all tested
participants. Multiple imputations were performed for values below
the instrument’s limit of detection to provide a normal distribution
in the natural log transformation of FENO (Fig 1). Subjects with
active chest pain, difficulty performing forceful expiration, or using
supplemental oxygen were excluded from participating.
To address potential confounders in FENO measurements, data
regarding consumption of nitrate-rich foods was captured by the
following questions: “Within the last three hours have you eaten
beets, broccoli, cabbage, celery, lettuce, spinach, or radishes?” and
“Within the last three hours have you eaten bacon, ham, hot dogs,
or smoked fish?” Upper respiratory infection was defined as an
affirmative answer to the following question: “In the past seven days,
journal.publications.chestnet.org
197
 have you had a cough, cold, phlegm, runny nose, or other respiratory
illness? Do not count allergies or hay fever.”
Alcohol Exposure
Alcohol questionnaire data were used to identify participants who met
the following definition for excessive alcohol consumption: binge
alcohol consumption (four or more drinks per occasion for a woman
and five or more drinks per occasion for a man); heavy alcohol
consumption (more than one drink per day on average for a
woman, and more than two drinks per day on average for a man).
This definition is consistent with the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention standards used to identify harmful patterns of
alcohol consumption.19 In NHANES, the following questions were
used to identify consumers meeting the given definition of excessive
alcohol consumption: “Had at least 12 drinks alcohol in life?” and
“Had at least 12 drinks in last year?” If drinkers answered yes to
both, then any of the following could be used: “Average number of
drinks per day?”; “Number of days had 5 or more drinks/past
12 months” (response had to equal or exceed 12 to average one
binge per month); and “Ever have 5 or more drinks every day?”
Former excessive drinkers met the criteria for excessive drinking but
answered no to the question, “Had at least 12 drinks in last year?”
Lifetime never drinkers answered no to the question, “Had at least
12 drinks alcohol in life?” The remainder were
classified as
nonexcessive alcohol consumers.
Alcohol-related liver disease was presumed in participants who reported
excessive alcohol use and had elevated liver enzyme levels at the time of
medical examination in the absence of other chronic liver diseases
including chronic hepatitis C and chronic hepatitis B. Elevated
liver enzyme levels were defined as serum alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) level > 40 units/L or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level
> 37 units/L in men and ALT or AST > 31 units/L in women.20
Other Variables
Age was categorized to represent the inflection points that occur in
FENO levels across the age ranges previously shown in NHANES.21 In
women, the categories for age range are 21 to 45 years and 46 to
79 years. In men, the categories for age range are 21 to 59 years and
60 to 79 years (NHANES limited FENO testing to a maximum of
79 years of age).
Never smokers were participants who smoked < 100 cigarettes in a
lifetime and do not currently smoke. Current smokers reported
smoking $ 100 cigarettes and currently smoke. Former smokers
previously smoked $ 100 cigarettes but do not currently smoke
cigarettes.
In
addition,
smokers
were
evaluated
in
regression
analysis using the survey question: “During the past 30 days, on the
days that you smoked, about how many cigarettes did you smoke
per day?”
Inhaled steroid and oral corticosteroid use was determined by asking
survey participants to report use of prescription medications during
a 1-month period prior to the survey date. The medications included
the following: fluticasone/salmeterol, mometasone, beclomethasone,
budesonide,
budesonide/formoterol,
flunisolide,
fluticasone,
triamcinolone, prednisone, prednisolone, and methylprednisolone.
Asthma was self-reported by indicating yes to the questions “Ever been
told you have asthma?” and “Still have asthma?” Self-report for hay
fever status in the past 12 months was used to reflect atopy;
although poorly sensitive, it has been shown to have good specificity
(up to 97%).22
Race and ethnicity were categorized into four groups: non-Hispanic
whites,
non-Hispanic
blacks,
Mexican
American/Hispanics,
and
other (Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian, or Pacific Islander).
Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing the weight
(kilograms) by the square of the height (meters). BMI was then
divided into six classifications based on the equivalent World Health
Organization criteria for conventional BMI: < 18.5 (underweight);
18.5 to 24.9 (normal weight); 25.0 to 29.9 (overweight); 30.0 to 34.9
(class I, obese); 35.0 to 39.9 (class II, severely obese); $ 40.0 (class
III, morbidly obese).23 Height was also recorded separately.

 Analytic Approach
FENO values were positively skewed and were natural log (ln)
transformed to approximate normality (Fig 1). The primary outcome
was ln(FENO). In secondary analyses, CRP level and peripheral blood
eosinophil
count
were
evaluated
as
continuous
variables.
All
estimates were calculated using the sampling weight to represent
people 21 years of age or older in the United States. Baseline
characteristics were presented as means with standard errors and
compared by t test for continuous variables and by c2 test for
comparison of two or more proportions. Linear regression was used
to test associations of ln(FENO) levels with covariables. Variable
selection for the final model was made a priori and based on a
review of previous literature and biologic plausibility. For average
cigarettes per day, the distribution was largely skewed to zero
cigarettes per day for never smokers, and therefore this variable was
categorized into the following, based on its distribution: zero
cigarettes per day, one to 10 cigarettes per day, 11 to 20 cigarettes
per day, and > 20 cigarettes per day. The final adjusted model
included age, sex, BMI, height, ethnicity, education level, poverty
index, asthma status, average number of cigarettes smoked per day,
inhaled steroid use, hay fever status, nitric oxide-rich vegetable
consumption, alcohol-related liver disease, and alcohol consumption.
Percent change and back transformation of the ln(FENO) was
performed for the alcohol groups in the multivariable model. Main
effects
were
tested
in
univariate
analysis,
and
then
two-way
interactions were tested including smoking and alcohol, asthma and
alcohol, and age and alcohol. Test for interactions with multiple
levels was performed according to a previously published method
using
Bonferroni-adjusted
t
statistics
for
b
coefficients
from
multivariable linear regression analysis using survey methods.24 Test
for linear and quadratic trend was performed using contrasts in the
coefficients corresponding to variables representing the alcohol
categories. The Pearson product-moment correlation was used to test
the correlation between ln(FENO) and CRP level/blood eosinophil
count. The analyses were performed with SAS (SAS Institute) and
Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN; Research Triangle Institute).
Results
Between 2007 and 2012, 30,442 individuals were
screened and selected. From those screened, 50.9% met
inclusion criteria and were enrolled, representing 15,501
people 21 years of age or older. Of the 15,501 NHANES
participants, 1,788 (11.5%) did not have completed
questionnaire or demographics data. Another 1,654
(10.7%) did not undergo two valid FENO measurements
for one of the following reasons: measurements were
nonreproducible; FENO examination was attempted
but no measurements were produced; or the participant
was excluded for medical reasons, including breathing
problems or chest pain. The final study population
for evaluation of FENO by alcohol group consisted of
12,059 people. A comparison of participants with
missing data with the final study population is shown
in e-Table 1. Participants with missing data included
a lower proportion of non-Hispanic whites, current
smokers, and those with alcohol-related liver disease.
In addition, those with missing data had lower
socioeconomic status and comprised a greater
proportion of women.
Excessive alcohol consumption was recorded in
3,693 participants (26.9%) who underwent the FENO
examination. Monthly binge alcohol consumption
was the most common form of excessive alcohol
consumption, described by 2,682 participants (72.6%).
Heavy daily alcohol consumption accounted for
197 excessive alcohol consumers (5.3%), and 814 of
the excessive alcohol group (22.1%) described both
binge alcohol consumption and heavy daily alcohol
consumption. Excessive alcohol consumers were
younger than members of the other alcohol groups and
included a greater proportion of males, non-Hispanic
whites, overweight participants, and never smokers.
Among the alcohol groups, excessive alcohol consumers
had the lowest median and ln(FENO) levels at 11.32 ppb
(interquartile range, 7.11-17.82 ppb) and 2.45 ppb
(SE 0.02; P < .0001), respectively. Demographics and
characteristics by alcohol group are shown in Table 1.
In univariate linear regression, the coefficients for all
the alcohol groups were negatively associated, in a
dose-dependent manner, with ln(FENO) levels in
comparison with the never-drinker group (Table 2).
In multivariable analysis adjusting for asthma, inhaled
steroid use, cigarettes per day, diet, hay fever, alcohol-
related liver disease, and baseline demographics, the
coefficient for excessive alcohol consumption continued
to have a negative association and remained an
independent predictor for ln(FENO) levels (Table 3).
ln(FENO) levels also decreased with increasing numbers
of cigarettes smoked per day, female sex, and education
> 12 years. On the other hand, FENO levels increased
with higher age group, increasing height, Hispanic
race, asthma, hay fever, and recent consumption of
nitrogen-rich vegetables. The association of ln(FENO)
with the alcohol groups had a decreasing linear trend
(P < .001), with the highest levels for nonexcessive
alcohol consumers and the lowest levels for excessive
alcohol consumers (Fig 2). Back transformation of the
natural log for the alcohol groups from multiple linear
regression demonstrates changes of 0.42, 1.18, and
1.47 ppb in comparison with the never-drinker group
for nonexcessive, former excessive, and excessive drinker
groups, respectively. These represent 3.00%, 8.48%,
and 10.59% changes, respectively. In the multivariable
regression model, no interaction was demonstrated
between alcohol categories and age (P ¼ 0.100), alcohol

 use and self-reported asthma (P ¼ 0.284), and alcohol
categories and average cigarettes smoked per day
(P ¼ 0.549). No significant associations were likewise
found between the excessive alcohol group and
peripheral blood eosinophil count or CRP level in
multivariable linear regression. Furthermore, neither
blood eosinophil count (P ¼ 0.692) nor CRP level
(P ¼ 0.330) had a linear trend by alcohol group. A
significant but weak correlation was found between
ln(FENO) levels and peripheral blood eosinophil counts
(Pearson’s coefficient, 0.21; P < .001) but not with
CRP level (Pearson’s coefficient, �0.02; P ¼ 0.16).
Stratified analysis based on participants with asthma
did not show any association between excessive
alcohol consumption and FENO levels (e-Table 2),
with no linear trend identified (P ¼ 0.461).
Discussion
In a representative sample of the US population,
FENO levels are linearly associated with level of alcohol
consumption, with excessive alcohol consumers having
the lowest levels in reference to never drinkers. More
than one-quarter of the US population can be described
as excessive alcohol consumers, and they have an
inverse relationship with FENO levels when compared
with never drinkers even after adjusting for asthma,
atopy, demographics, steroid use, diet, cigarette use,
socioeconomic status, education, and other confounders.
These changes are not demonstrated in the blood
eosinophil or CRP level, indicating a role for excessive
alcohol consumption in airway inflammation and
biology.
Excessive alcohol consumption accounts for one in
10 deaths among working-age adults and is the third
leading preventable cause of death in the United
States.25,26 We show that more than one-quarter of
the US population qualifies as excessive alcohol
consumers, which is similar to another report from a
nationally representative sample of US residents.27
Binge drinking is the most common form of excessive
alcohol consumption and is responsible for more than
one-half of alcohol-associated deaths and three-quarters
of an estimated $223.5 billion dollars in economic
costs.19 We found that nearly three-quarters of US
residents with excessive alcohol consumption are
binge alcohol consumers. Much of the biological
effects of unhealthy alcohol consumption have been
investigated in chronic alcohol consumers (ie, alcohol
use disorder), but < 5% of excessive alcohol consumers
are characterized as having an alcohol use disorder.27
Alcoholic lung disease and alcohol impairment of
airway host defenses occur in individuals with an
alcohol use disorder. Airway ciliary dysfunction,
glutathione depletion, epithelial barrier dysfunction,
cilia desensitization, and a proinflammatory state
represent well-described pathologic consequences
resulting from chronic alcohol use, which increase
the risk for pneumonia and acute respiratory distress
syndrome.10,28-31 However, despite the fact that
excessive alcohol consumers constitute a large
proportion of the US population, the clinical
significance of the depressed FENO levels found in
this population is unknown and requires future
investigations. Studies from NHANES to identify
reference standards and thresholds for FENO in healthy
adults have been reported.32,33 The results from these
NHANES studies and the American Thoracic Society
clinical practice guideline identify cutoff points between
39 and 50 ppb as clinically relevant,3 but no data are
available regarding low FENO levels in healthy subjects.
In a small cohort study in which patients with
normal lung function and upper respiratory symptoms
were monitored for 2 years, nearly one-half were
subsequently diagnosed with asthma,34 and FENO
levels above 7 ppb demonstrated an area under the
receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.896 with
82.5% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity, respectively,
for an asthma diagnosis. Measurement of FENO levels
have been examined mainly in the diagnosis and
management of patients with asthma; however, we
have shown that no meaningful differences of excessive
alcohol consumers were found in FENO levels when

 examining asthma participants only. Our finding of
a 21.3% reduction in the geometric mean between
never drinkers and excessive alcohol consumers and
a 10.59% reduction from the multivariable model
among all participants may represent clinical relevance.
Although the back transformation from the natural
log shows a small change in parts per billion from
the multivariable model, this interpretation is limited
because the calculation is negatively biased.35 More
importantly, the decreasing dose-dependent linear
trend shown in our results should be investigated
further in individuals with recent excessive alcohol
consumption or detectable blood alcohol concentrations,
in whom the effect on FENO levels may be stronger.
We did not find a role for alcohol in individuals with
asthma: no interaction between asthma and alcohol
consumption, or between FENO level and alcohol
consumption, was demonstrated. This supports the
notion that alcohol consumption does not contribute
significantly to asthma activity as measured by FENO.
However, our data are limited to self-reported asthma
and likely constitute a majority of healthy individuals
without symptoms at the time of testing. Historically,
alcoholic beverages have been used to treat asthma
symptoms and have been demonstrated in experiments
to have beneficial effects via bronchodilation and an
increase in vital capacity.11,36,37 However, adverse
asthma reactions have been described in groups with
abnormal acetaldehyde accumulation or sensitivities
to nonalcohol components of alcoholic beverages
(such as brewer’s yeast or sulfites), subsequent to alcohol
consumption.13-15 More recently, survey studies have
identified wine as the most common alcohol trigger
for asthma symptoms; however, the underlying
mechanism is not well understood.38,39 Additional
studies are needed to evaluate FENO levels in individuals
with symptomatic or more severe asthma to fully
understand the magnitude and clinical relevance of
alcohol consumption in asthma control and symptoms.
Nitric oxide is produced by the human lung and is a
biological mediator of airway inflammation with
abnormal levels in multiple lung diseases, most notably
asthma.40 In the airway, nitric oxide also functions as a
vasodilator and bronchodilator41 and as a ciliary beat
frequency stimulator.42 It is also a free radical that
provides cytotoxic effects important in the antimicrobial
function of the airway.43 Research on the association
of short-term alcohol consumption with FENO levels
in humans is limited to a small study in which only
participants with asthma had a decrease in FENO levels
and healthy participants had no appreciable change.18
On the other hand, results from our US population
sample show that excessive alcohol consumption is
an independent predictor of lower FENO levels, with a
dose-dependent association. In comparison, CRP and
blood eosinophil levels (markers of systemic and
allergic inflammation, respectively) did not demonstrate
a significant association. Whereas peripheral blood
eosinophils have been shown to be a predictor for FENO
levels in people with asthma,3,44 our findings show a
weak correlation with FENO in the general US population
and no association with excessive alcohol consumers
in adjusted analysis. Collectively, we interpret these
observations to suggest a previously unrecognized role
for excessive alcohol consumption in modulating nitric
oxide pathways specific to the airway.
The mechanism by which alcohol might reduce FENO
levels is not known, although there are intriguing
possibilities based on laboratory and small-animal
studies. Airway epithelial cell culture studies have
shown that brief alcohol exposure increases nitric
oxide-dependent airway ciliary beat frequency by
activating the endothelial isoform of nitric oxide
synthase (eNOS or NOS3).31 In contrast, prolonged
alcohol ingestion by mice resulted in reduced lung
nitric oxide levels as determined in bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid and was associated with low L-arginine
blood levels, suggesting lung nitric oxide depletion.45
Last, the role of eNOS in the production of exhaled
nitric oxide in airways is probably minor compared
with that produced by the inducible form of NOS
(iNOS or NOS2), which is thought to be the primary
source of FENO in airways diseases.46
The major strength of our study is the availability of data
from NHANES, which is a nationally representative and
comprehensive survey drawing from a large and diverse
sample of participants. The survey design avoids
volunteer bias and enhances the generalizability of
our results. However, several limitations apply to this
cross-sectional survey. Our missing data analysis
indicated that missing data did not occur at random
and that bias may have occurred in FENO testing and
questionnaire data capture. Changes in FENO over time
could not be captured to better assess the relationship
to alcohol consumption patterns. Alcohol consumption
was self-reported, and a misclassification bias of the
alcohol groups may have occurred. In addition,
environmental exposures, second-hand smoke exposure,
and diurnal variability may have confounded FENO
results. Similar to prior studies, we show that FENO levels

 are decreased in smokers and increased in subjects
with atopy and asthma, supporting the robustness of
our findings.32,47 The application of our results to
populations outside the United States is less reliable
because of differences in legal drinking age and
definition of excessive alcohol consumption. Many
European nations have lower drinking ages and,
therefore, include a younger population and also
classify higher drinking thresholds for unhealthy
alcohol consumption.48
In conclusion, we demonstrate a significant negative
association of excessive alcohol consumption with
FENO levels that was independent of other well-described
factors that influence FENO. We propose that
interpretation of FENO levels should account for
alcohol use. Our observation underscores the role
of excessive alcohol use in impacting biological
responses in the lung, and moreover, highlights the
importance of alcohol in mediating the response of
nitric oxide pathways in the lung. Further investigations
are warranted to explore the complex interaction
between alcohol and nitric oxide in the airways in
order to identify populations at risk for airways
disease and as an aid in the search for therapeutic
interventions.
