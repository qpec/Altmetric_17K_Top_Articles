Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is the prototypical psychedelic drug,
but its effects on the human brain have never been studied before
with modern neuroimaging. Here, three complementary neuroimag-
ing techniques: arterial spin labeling (ASL), blood oxygen level-
dependent (BOLD) measures, and magnetoencephalography (MEG),
implemented during resting state conditions, revealed marked
changes in brain activity after LSD that correlated strongly with its
characteristic psychological effects. Increased visual cortex cerebral
blood flow (CBF), decreased visual cortex alpha power, and a greatly
expanded primary visual cortex (V1) functional connectivity profile
correlated strongly with ratings of visual hallucinations, implying that
intrinsic brain activity exerts greater influence on visual processing in
the psychedelic state, thereby defining its hallucinatory quality. LSD’s
marked effects on the visual cortex did not significantly correlate with
the drug’s other characteristic effects on consciousness, however.
Rather, decreased connectivity between the parahippocampus and
retrosplenial cortex (RSC) correlated strongly with ratings of “ego-dis-
solution” and “altered meaning,” implying the importance of this par-
ticular circuit for the maintenance of “self” or “ego” and its processing
of “meaning.” Strong relationships were also found between the dif-
ferent imaging metrics, enabling firmer inferences to be made about
their functional significance. This uniquely comprehensive examination
of the LSD state represents an important advance in scientific re-
search with psychedelic drugs at a time of growing interest in their
scientific and therapeutic value. The present results contribute impor-
tant new insights into the characteristic hallucinatory and conscious-
ness-altering properties of psychedelics that inform on how they can
model certain pathological states and potentially treat others.

L
ysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a potent serotonergic hallu-
cinogen or “psychedelic” that alters consciousness in a profound
and characteristic way. First synthesized in 1938, its extraordinary
psychological properties were not discovered until 1943 (1). LSD
would go on to have a major effect on psychology and psychiatry in
the 1950s and 1960s; however, increasing recreational use and its
influence on youth culture provoked the drug’s being made illegal in
the late 1960s. As a consequence, human research with LSD has
been on pause for half a century. However, inspired by a revival of
research with other psychedelics, such as psilocybin and ayahuasca,
a small number of new reports on the psychological effects of LSD
have recently been published (2–6).
LSD has a high affinity for a range of different neurotransmitter
receptors, but its characteristic psychological effects are thought to
be mediated by serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) agonism (7).
Previous neurophysiological research with LSD is limited to elec-
troencephalography (EEG) studies in the 1950s and 1960s. These
reported reductions in oscillatory power, predominantly in the
lower-frequency bands, and an increase in the frequency of alpha
rhythms (8). Broadband decreases in cortical oscillatory power
have been observed in modern EEG and magnetoencephalog-
raphy (MEG) studies with psilocybin (9, 10), with EEG and the
dimethyltryptamine-containing brew “ayahuasca” (11), and with
rodent brain local-field potential recordings and a range of dif-
ferent 5-HT2AR agonists (12–14).
The effects of psychedelics (other than LSD) on human brain
activity have also previously been investigated with positron
emission tomography (PET) (15) and functional magnetic reso-
nance imaging (fMRI) (16). fMRI studies with psilocybin revealed
decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) and blood oxygen level-
dependent (BOLD) signal in connector hubs (16), decreased
Significance
Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), the prototypical “psychedelic,”
may be unique among psychoactive substances. In the decades
that followed its discovery, the magnitude of its effect on science,
the arts, and society was unprecedented. LSD produces profound,
sometimes life-changing experiences in microgram doses, making
it a particularly powerful scientific tool. Here we sought to ex-
amine its effects on brain activity, using cutting-edge and com-
plementary
neuroimaging
techniques
in
the
first
modern
neuroimaging study of LSD. Results revealed marked changes in
brain blood flow, electrical activity, and network communication
patterns that correlated strongly with the drug’s hallucinatory
and other consciousness-altering properties. These results have
implications for the neurobiology of consciousness and for po-
tential applications of LSD in psychological research.

 resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) in major resting
state networks (RSNs) such as the default-mode network (DMN)
(17), and the emergence of novel patterns of communication (18,
19), whereas increased cortical glucose metabolism was found with
PET (15). Notably, the spatial locations of the PET-, fMRI-, EEG-,
and MEG-measured effects of psychedelics are relatively consis-
tent; for example, high-level cortical regions, such as the posterior
cingulate cortex (PCC), and some of the principal effects of psi-
locybin revealed by fMRI (e.g., decreased DMN RSFC) were re-
cently replicated by a separate team working with ayahuasca (20).
Consistent with a prior hypothesis (17), these studies suggest
that an “entropic” effect on cortical activity is a key characteristic
of the psychedelic state. However, a putative excitation of hip-
pocampal/parahippocampal gyri activity has also been observed
with fMRI and psychedelics in humans (19) and animals (14).
Moreover, depth EEG studies in the 1950s reported activations in
medial temporal lobe regions during psychosis-like states under
LSD and other psychedelics (21, 22). Further, patients with epi-
lepsy with resection of the medial temporal lobes showed atten-
uated LSD effects postsurgery (23), and electrical stimulation of
medial temporal lobe circuitry produces visual hallucinations of
somewhat similar nature to those produced by psychedelics [e.g.,
distorted visual perception (24) and dreamlike “visions” (25)].
The present study sought to investigate the acute brain effects
of LSD in healthy volunteers, using a comprehensive placebo-
controlled neuroimaging design incorporating ASL, BOLD signal
measures, and MEG resting state scans. It was predicted that major
RSNs (e.g., the DMN) and hippocampal/parahippocampal gyri
circuitry would be implicated in the drug’s mechanism of action.
Twenty healthy participants attended two scanning days (LSD and
placebo) at least 2 wk apart in a balanced-order, within-subjects
design. Sessions included an fMRI followed by a MEG scan, each
lasting 75 min. Data were acquired during eye-closed, task-free,
“resting state” conditions. Drug/placebo were administered in solu-
tion and injected i.v. over the course of 2 min. Two resting state ASL
scans totaling 16 min were completed 100 min after i.v. adminis-
tration of LSD (75 μg in 10 mL saline) or placebo (10 mL saline),
corresponding to the initial phase of the peak subjective effects of
LSD (peak effects were reached ∼120–150 min postinfusion). Two
resting state BOLD scans totaling 14 min were completed 135 min
postinfusion, and two resting state MEG scans totaling 14 min were
completed 225 min postinfusion. All analyses applied multiple
comparison correction (SI Appendix) and two-tailed hypothesis
testing unless particularly strong prior hypotheses were held.
Results
The intensity of LSD’s subjective effects was relatively stable for
the ASL and BOLD scans but attenuated somewhat for the MEG
(SI Appendix, Table S1). Participants carried out VAS-style ratings
via button-press and a digital display screen presented after each
scan (SI Appendix), and the 11-factor altered states of conscious-
ness (ASC) questionnaire (26) was completed at the end of each
dosing day (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). All participants reported eyes-
closed visual hallucinations and other marked changes in con-
sciousness under LSD.
Data from 15 volunteers were suitable for the ASL and BOLD
analyses (four females; mean age, 30.5 ± 8.0 y; SI Appendix).
Differences in CBF in the two conditions were calculated using a
whole-brain analysis (cluster-correction, P < 0.05). Greater CBF
under LSD was observed in the visual cortex (Fig. 1), and the
magnitude of these increases correlated positively with ratings of
complex imagery on the ASC (r = 0.64; P = 0.01; Bonferroni
corrected P = 0.04; SI Appendix, Fig. S9A). The unthresholded
difference in CBF can be viewed in Neurovault (27) (neurovault.
org/collections/FBVSAVDQ/).
Seed-based RSFC analyses were also performed. A bilateral
parahippocampal (PH) seed was chosen based on previous find-
ings with psilocybin (19) and a primary visual cortex (V1) seed was
chosen based on the characteristic visual perceptual effects of
psychedelics. V1 was identified using a retinotopic-localizer par-
adigm (SI Appendix). Finally, the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) was
chosen because of our previous focus on this region in studies with
psilocybin and MDMA (16, 28). Analyses revealed increased
RSFC between V1 and a large number of cortical and subcortical
brain regions (Fig. 2 and SI Appendix, Table S3), decreased RSFC
between the PH and the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and PCC, and
increased RSFC between the PH and dorsal mPFC and right dor-
solateral PFC (Fig. 3 and SI Appendix, Table S4). Increased RSFC
between the vmPFC and the bilateral caudate and inferior frontal
gyrus was also observed, as was decreased vmPFC-PCC RSFC (SI
Appendix, Fig. S4 and SI Appendix, Table S5). All the relevant
unthresholded maps can be viewed in Neurovault (27) (neurovault.
org/collections/FBVSAVDQ/).
Increased V1 RSFC (to the most significant regions shown in
Fig. 2: P < 0.01; 5,000 permutations; SI Appendix, Fig. S8)
correlated with VAS ratings of simple hallucinations (r = 0.62;
P = 0.012; Bonferroni corrected P = 0.048; SI Appendix, Fig.
S9B), as well as ASC ratings of elementary (r = 0.63; P = 0.012;
Bonferroni corrected P = 0.048; SI Appendix, Fig. S9C) and
complex (r = 0.74; P = 0.0016; Bonferroni corrected P = 0.006;
SI Appendix, Fig. S9D) imagery. Decreased PH RSFC (to the
significant regions shown in Fig. 3) correlated with VAS ratings
of ego-dissolution (r = 0.73; P = 0.0018; SI Appendix, Fig. S9E)
and “altered meaning” on the ASC (r = 0.82; P = 0.0002;
Bonferroni corrected P = 0.002; SI Appendix, Fig. S9F). Im-
portantly, some of these (hypothesized) correlations were
phenomenology selective (SI Appendix, Table S7): increased vi-
sual cortex CBF and V1 RSFC correlated more strongly with the
visual hallucinatory aspect of the drug experience than the al-
tered meaning/ego-dissolution aspect, whereas the opposite was
true for decreased PH RSFC. Changes in vmPFC RSFC did not
correlate with any of the ratings.

 Next, the effect of LSD on brain network properties was in-
vestigated. Twelve functionally familiar RSNs were identified in a
set of 20 spatially independent components derived from in-
dependent data (human connectome project; SI Appendix). These
RSNs are as follows: a medial visual network, a lateral visual net-
work (VisL), an occipital pole network (VisO), an auditory network
(AUD), a sensorimotor network, the DMN, a parietal cortex net-
work (PAR), the dorsal attention network, the salience network, a
posterior opercular network (POP), the left frontoparietal network,
and the right frontoparietal network (rFP).
Four metrics were calculated for each RSN: within-RSN CBF,
within-RSN RSFC or “integrity,” within-RSN BOLD signal vari-
ance, and between-RSN RSFC or “segregation.” Between-condi-
tion differences in the first three metrics are shown in Fig. 4A, and
the between-RSN RSFC results are shown in Fig. 4B. Differences
(increases) in CBF were restricted to the visual RSNs, whereas
differences in variance and integrity (decreases) were much more
pronounced and universal. According to previous research with
psilocybin (17), it was predicted that decreased DMN integrity (or
DMN “disintegration”) would correlate with ratings of ego-disso-
lution, and this hypothesis was supported (r = 0.49; P = 0.03; SI
Appendix, Fig. S9G). Given the large number of possible permu-
tations, additional correlational analyses were not performed;
however, to test the selectivity of the relationship between DMN
disintegration and ego-dissolution, correlations were calculated for
ego-dissolution and the integrity of the other 11 RSNs, and none
were significant (SI Appendix, Table S2). Disintegration of the visual
RSNs did not correlate with ratings of visual hallucinations. See SI
Appendix, Fig. S5, for brain images of the RSN integrity results.
Between-RSN RSFC or RSN segregation was also markedly
modulated by LSD. Decreased segregation (red squares with white
asterisks in Fig. 4B, right matrix) was observed between eight RSN
pairs (VisL–PAR, VisL–dorsal attention network, VisO–POP,
AUD–PAR, AUD–rFP, DMN–salience network, PAR–POP,
POP–rFP), with only one pair (VisO–rFP) showing increased
segregation (blue square with white asterisk in Fig. 4B, right ma-
trix). Contrary to a prior hypothesis, decreased RSN segregation
(in the eight networks that showed this effect) did not correlate
with ratings of ego-dissolution (r = 0.12; P > 0.05).
Data from 14 volunteers were suitable for the MEG analyses
(three females; mean age, 32.1 ± 8.3 y). Primary analyses focused on
between-condition
differences
in
frequency-specific
oscillatory
power, measured during eyes-closed rest. The relevant data (14 min
of rest) were acquired ∼50 min after completion of the MRI pro-
tocol and filtered into the following frequency bands: delta (1–4 Hz),
theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–15 Hz), beta (15–30 Hz), low gamma (31–
49 Hz), and high gamma (51–99 Hz). Results revealed decreased
oscillatory power under LSD in four frequency bands (Fig. 5A), with
some suspected residual muscle artifact confounding the gamma
results. For the lower-frequency bands (i.e., 1–30 Hz), the decreases
reached significance in most of the sensors. To explore relationships
between these outcomes and subjective measures, VAS ratings of
ego-dissolution and visual hallucinations (simple and complex) were
entered into regression analyses, using cluster permutation testing.
Significant relationships were found between ego-dissolution and
decreased delta (mean cluster, r = −0.54; P < 0.05) and alpha power
(mean cluster, r = −0.29; P < 0.05) and between simple hallucina-
tions and decreased alpha power (mean cluster, r = −0.61; P < 0.05)
(Fig. 4B). Plotting the power spectrum independently for each
condition for the significant alpha cluster (Fig. 5C), it is evident that
the distribution of power is decreased across a broad frequency

 range under LSD, and the peak alpha rhythm is reduced in ampli-
tude and of higher frequency (i.e., 10 Hz under placebo, 12 Hz
under LSD; t = 4.21; P = 0.0009). Source modeling revealed that
sources of the power decreases were relatively distributed through-
out the brain (SI Appendix, Table S8), with significant effects in the
PCC/precuneus (theta, alpha, and beta) and other high-level cortical
regions (delta-beta).
This study’s multimodal design enabled correlational analyses to
be performed between the various (significant) imaging outcomes.
This was done in a hypothesis-driven manner, and because the
outcomes’ directions were already known, one-tailed tests were
performed. Relationships were observed between the increases in
CBF (localized to the visual cortex) and decreases in alpha power in
posterior (occipital cortex) sensors (r = −0.59; P = 0.029; SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S6) and between increases in V1 RSFC (to the most
significant regions: P < 0.01; 5,000 permutations; SI Appendix, Fig.
S8) and decreased posterior-sensor alpha power (r = −0.81; P =
0.0015; SI Appendix, Fig. S6), but there was only a trend-level re-
lationship between increases in visual cortex CBF and increases in
V1 RSFC (r = 0.43; P = 0.055). The mean change (decreases) in
the integrity of the 12 RSNs correlated very strongly with the mean
change (decreases) in their variance (r = 0.89; P = 4 × 10−6; SI
Appendix, Fig. S6). Neither metric correlated with the mean change
in CBF, however [r = 0.1 (P > 0.05) and r = 0.33 (P > 0.05) for
integrity and variance, respectively], nor head motion (SI Appendix),
but they did correlate with the mean decrease in power (significant
sensors) for the four displayed frequency bands [r = 0.79 (P = 0.001;
SI Appendix, Fig. S6) and r = 0.76 (P = 0.002) for integrity and
variance, respectively]. Mean decreases in RSN segregation (for the
eight pairs that showed this effect) correlated with mean decreases
in RSN integrity (mean of all 12 RSNs, r = 0.53; P = 0.02; SI
Appendix, Fig. S6) and reduced oscillatory power (delta-beta com-
bined, r = 0.67; P = 0.017; SI Appendix, Fig. S6), but not decreased
RSN variance (r = 0.33, P > 0.05) nor increased CBF (r = 0.18; P >
0.05). Given the number of possible permutations, we chose not to
explore beyond these relationships.
Discussion
The present findings offer a comprehensive new perspective on the
changes in brain activity characterizing the LSD state, enabling us
to make confident new inferences about its functional neuroanat-
omy. Principal findings include increased visual cortex CBF, RSFC,
and decreased alpha power, predicting the magnitude of visual
hallucinations; and decreased DMN integrity, PH-RSC RSFC, and
delta and alpha power (e.g., in the PCC), correlating with profound
changes in consciousness, typified by ego-dissolution. More broadly,
the results reinforce the view that resting state ASL, BOLD FC,
and MEG measures can be used to inform on the neural correlates
of the psychedelic state (9, 16). Importantly, strong relationships
were found between the different imaging measures, particularly
between changes in BOLD RSFC (e.g., network “disintegration”
and “desegregation”) and decreases in oscillatory power, enabling
us to make firmer inferences about their functional meaning.
The present study sheds new light on the relationship between
changes in spontaneous brain activity and psychedelic-induced
visual hallucinations. Strong relationships were observed between
increased V1 RSFC and decreased alpha power, as well as ratings
of both simple and complex visual hallucinations. The latter result
is consistent with previous findings with psilocybin (29). Impor-
tantly, a very strong relationship was also observed between in-
creased V1 RSFC and decreased alpha power in occipital sensors,
suggesting that as well as being commonly related to visual hal-
lucinations, these physiological effects are closely interrelated. The
increase in V1 RSFC under LSD is a particularly novel and
striking finding and suggests that a far greater proportion of the
brain contributes to visual processing in the LSD state than under
normal conditions. This expansion of V1 RSFC may explain how
normally discreet psychological functions (e.g., emotion, cognition,
and indeed the other primary senses) can more readily “color”
visual experience in the psychedelic state.
Biologically informed modeling has suggested that instability
within the primary visual cortex may facilitate the emergence of
geometric hallucinations via self-organized patterns of neural ex-
citation (30), and eyes-closed fMRI recordings during ayahuasca
hallucinations suggest the visual cortex behaves “as if” there is
external input when there is none (31) (see also ref. 29). The
present findings of increased visual cortex CBF, expanded V1
RSFC, and decreased alpha power may be seen as consistent with
the notion of “seeing with eyes-shut” under psychedelics, because
they are all properties normally associated with visual stimulation
(32, 33). Cortical alpha has been hypothesized to serve a general
inhibitory function, filtering out “stimulus-irrelevant” information
(34). Thus, reduced alpha power (9, 29, 35) could have dis-
inhibitory consequences, facilitating the release of anarchic pat-
terns of excitation that manifest spontaneously and experientially
as visual hallucinations. This hypothesis is leant (indirect) support
by two prior studies that found reduced spontaneous visual cortex
alpha power under psilocybin alongside reduced evoked vi-
sual responses (9, 29). Further work, using higher-resolution
brain imaging, machine learning techniques, dynamic measures
of functional and effective connectivity, and improved “capture”
of visual hallucinations (e.g., via button press or experience
sampling), may help to develop this appealing model (e.g., see
ref. 36).

 The present data also inform on another fundamental question;
namely, how do psychedelics alter brain function to (so profoundly)
alter consciousness? Interestingly, although the effects of LSD on
the visual system were pronounced, they did not significantly cor-
relate with its more fundamental effects on consciousness. Instead,
a specific relationship was found between DMN disintegration and
ego-dissolution, supporting prior findings with psilocybin (17). Also
consistent with previous psilocybin research (9), a significant re-
lationship was found between decreased PCC alpha power and
ego-dissolution. Moreover, an especially strong relationship was
found between PH-RSC decoupling and ego-dissolution (see also
ref. 10). Thus, in the same way the neurobiology of psychedelic-
induced visual hallucinations can inform on the neurobiology of
visual processing, so the neurobiology of psychedelic-induced ego-
dissolution can inform on the neurobiology of the “self” or “ego”
(37), and the present results extend our understanding in this
regard, implying that the preservation of DMN integrity, PH-RSC
communication, and regular oscillatory rhythms within the PCC
may be important for the maintenance of one’s sense of self or ego.
Linking these results to pathology, an especially strong re-
lationship was found between PH-RSC decoupling and the “al-
tered meaning” factor on the ASC. Interestingly, altered activity
within the PH-RSC circuit under psilocybin has previously been
found to correlate with the spiritual experience and insightfulness
dimensions of the 11-factor ASC (10), and altered RSC/PCC ac-
tivity has been found to correlate with ego-dissolution (9), sug-
gesting modulation of this particular circuit may be an important
feature of especially profound psychedelic experiences. The altered
meaning factor of the ASC is composed of items such as “some
unimportant things acquired a special meaning” and “things in my
surroundings had a new or alien meaning” that are phenomeno-
logically resonant with the notion of “aberrant salience” in
schizophrenia research (38). Impaired reality testing as a corollary
of impaired ego functioning may explain an association between
ego-dissolution and altered meaning. Similarities between aspects
of psychosis and the psychedelic state have long been debated, and
one of the most influential hypotheses on the neurobiology of
schizophrenia proposes a functional disconnect between certain
brain structures in the disorder (39). In this context, it is intriguing
to consider whether the PH-RSC circuit is involved in certain
psychosis-related experiences (e.g., refs. 40 and 41). More specifi-
cally, it would be interesting to examine the integrity of the PH-
RSC connection in cases of endogenous psychoses in which phe-
nomena such as altered meaning, ego-dissolution, and/or impaired
reality-testing are observed. To our knowledge, these specific
phenomena have never been formally investigated in imaging
studies involving patients exhibiting endogenous psychoses, but
studies on early psychosis and the at-risk mental state may be in-
formative in this regard (e.g., ref. 40).
When the present results are considered in relation to previous
human neuroimaging studies with psychedelics, some general prin-
ciples emerge. It seems increasingly evident that psychedelics reduce
the stability and integrity of well-established brain networks (e.g.,
ref. 16) and simultaneously reduce the degree of separateness or
segregation between them (e.g., ref. 42); that is, they induce network
disintegration and desegregation. Importantly, these effects are
consistent with the more general principle that cortical brain activity
becomes more “entropic” under psychedelics (17). Furthermore,
with the benefit of the present study’s multimodal imaging design,
we can extend on these generic insights to postulate some more
specific physiological properties of the psychedelic state and how
these relate to some of its key psychological properties; namely,
expanded V1 RSFC relates to the magnitude of visual hallucina-
tions and decoupling of the PH-RSC circuit relates to the level of
ego-dissolution, and perhaps also the profundity of a psychedelic
experience more generally (also see refs. 9 and 10 in this regard).
Before concluding, we should highlight some general limitations
of the present study and address a discrepant finding in the field.
Regarding limitations, a fully randomized, double-blind design is
often considered the gold standard; however, experimental blinding
is known to be ineffective in studies with conspicuous interventions.
Thus, a single-blind, balanced-order design with an inert placebo
(offering the simplest and “cleanest” possible control condition)
was considered an effective compromise. Also, although the mul-
timodal design of this study was an advantage, the experimental
protocol was demanding for participants, and the different scan
types (ASL, BOLD, and MEG) occurred separately in time. Si-
multaneous EEG-fMRI may therefore offer some advantageous in
this regard. Another general limitation of imaging studies involving
potent psychoactive drugs, is the issue of between-condition dif-
ferences in head motion and related artifacts. In this study, we
opted to use the most rigorous motion-correction strategies avail-
able (SI Appendix), despite motion levels being no higher than
those seen in previous studies by our group (16). Regarding the
discrepant finding, a previous psilocybin ASL study of ours
revealed decreased CBF postpsilocybin (i.v.) during eyes-open
rest (16), whereas the present i.v. LSD study found increased
CBF localized to the visual cortex with eyes-closed rest. One must
be cautious of proxy measures of neural activity (that lack
temporal resolution), such as CBF or glucose metabolism, lest
the relationship between these measures, and the underlying
neural activity they are assumed to index, be confounded by
extraneous factors, such as a direct vascular action of the drug

Blue indicates less power under LSD. Units are t-statistics. Significant sensor
clusters are marked such that stars correspond to P < 0.01 and crosses to P <
0.05 (corrected). Source localization results are also displayed. (B) Significant
correlations between changes (decreases) in oscillatory power and subjective
phenomena. (C) Power spectra for the significant sensor cluster in B (simple

 (43). For this reason, more direct measures of neural activity
(e.g., EEG and MEG) and/or more dynamic fMRI measures (e.g.,
RSFC) should be considered more reliable indices of the func-
tional brain effects of psychedelics, and it is notable in this regard
that our previous MEG (9) and RSFC (16, 19, 42) findings with
psilocybin are highly consistent with those observed here with
LSD. Thus, rather than speculate on the above-mentioned dis-
crepancy, it may be more progressive to highlight the advantages
of EEG/MEG and dynamic fMRI and conclude that further work
would be required to resolve discrepancies in the literature re-
garding the effects of psychedelics on metabolically related metrics
that lack temporal resolution.
Finally, as evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of
psychedelics mounts (6, 44–46), so does our need to better un-
derstand how these drugs work on the brain. In many psychiatric
disorders, the brain may be viewed as having become entrenched in
pathology, such that core behaviors become automated and rigid.
Consistent with their “entropic” effect on cortical activity (17),
psychedelics may work to break down such disorders by disman-
tling the patterns of activity on which they rest. Future work is
required to test this hypothesis and the others that have been
presented here as part of a broader initiative to properly utilize
these valuable scientific tools.
