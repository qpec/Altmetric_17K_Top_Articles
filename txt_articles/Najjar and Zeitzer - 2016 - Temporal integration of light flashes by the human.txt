Introduction
Mammals, including humans, have evolved to adapt their endoge-
nous physiological and behavioral rhythms to be consistent with 
the Earth’s 24-hour light/dark cycle. Such endogenous circadian 
rhythms range from the behavioral sleep-wake and arousal cycles to 
the secretion pattern of hormones, such as melatonin, cortisol, and 
thyroid-stimulating hormone. Circadian rhythms are under the con-
trol of a master oscillator located in the anterior hypothalamus just 
above the optic chiasm called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). 
The rhythms of the SCN have a period length that is close to, but 
not exactly, 24 hours and is entrained (synchronized) to the 24-hour 
light/dark cycle by light detected by ocular retinal photoreceptive 
elements (1–3). Inappropriate circadian entrainment is associated 
with alterations in thermoregulation, cardiovascular function, 
immune processes, sleep, vigilance, memory, and cognition (4–9).
In the mammalian retina, a small subset of ganglion cells con-
tains the photopigment melanopsin and is intrinsically photosen-
sitive (10–12). These intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion 
cells (ipRGCs) endogenously transduce light but also integrate 
processed neural signals coming from the traditional rod and 
cone photoreceptors of the outer retina (13–15). Axons emerging 
from the ipRGCs project to nonimage-forming (NIF) centers in 
the mammalian brain to evoke subcortical changes that include, 
but are not limited to, the resetting of circadian timing (1, 10, 11, 
16, 17), suppression of melatonin production (18), activation of the 
pupillary light reflex (14, 15), change in arousal levels (19, 20) and 
sleep drive (21), alleviation of seasonal depression (22, 23), and 
possibly the induction of migraine headaches (24). Given its NIF 
implications, light has been used for its considerable therapeutic 
potential in chronobiological disorders such as jet lag and shift 
work but has also been used to treat sleep and mood disorders as 
well as cognitive impairment via correction of circadian misalign-
ment and an acute activating response (22, 23, 25–32).
Underlying these NIF responses to light, traditional rod and 
cones photoreceptors are thought to be implicated in the fast and 
transient responses, whereas melanopsin is hypothesized to have 
a predominant effect on the sustainability and persistence of a 
response (33, 34). To date, however, the integrative physiology 
BACKGROUND. Beyond image formation, the light that is detected by retinal photoreceptors influences subcortical functions, 
including circadian timing, sleep, and arousal. The physiology of nonimage-forming (NIF) photoresponses in humans is 
not well understood; therefore, the development of therapeutic interventions based on this physiology, such as bright light 
therapy to treat chronobiological disorders, remains challenging.
METHODS. Thirty-nine participants were exposed to 60 minutes of either continuous light (n = 8) or sequences of 
2-millisecond light flashes (n = 31) with different interstimulus intervals (ISIs; ranging from 2.5 to 240 seconds). Melatonin 
phase shift and suppression, along with changes in alertness and sleepiness, were assessed.
RESULTS. We determined that the human circadian system integrates flash sequences in a nonlinear fashion with a linear 
rise to a peak response (ISI = 7.6 ± 0.53 seconds) and a power function decrease following the peak of responsivity. At 
peak ISI, flashes were at least 2-fold more effective in phase delaying the circadian system as compared with exposure to 
equiluminous continuous light 3,800 times the duration. Flashes did not change melatonin concentrations or alertness in an 
ISI-dependent manner.
CONCLUSION. We have demonstrated that intermittent light is more effective than continuous light at eliciting 
circadian changes. These findings cast light on the phenomenology of photic integration and suggest a dichotomous 
retinohypothalamic network leading to circadian phase shifting and other NIF photoresponses. Further clinical trials are 
required to judge the practicality of light flash protocols.

light in a nonlinear fashion. Intermittent patterns of light tested 
thus far fail, however, to elicit greater changes in outcomes when 
compared with continuous light exposures. Shorter duration of 
light exposures in the order of microseconds to milliseconds have 
been tested in rodents (45–47). While a single 2-millisecond flash 
of light is insufficient to phase shift the murine circadian system, 
a sequence of flashes administered once per minute for 60 min-
utes is sufficient to evoke phase delays (48). This study by Van 
Den Pol and colleagues, in addition to other published studies in 
rodents (45–47), established that the mammalian circadian sys-
tem has the capacity to respond to a sequence of very brief, milli-
second flashes of light.
of NIF photoreception in humans remains incompletely under-
stood, as it has wavelength (35–39), intensity (40), duration (41), 
and pattern (42–44) responses that are considerably distinct from 
the traditional perceptual image-forming responses, and most 
knowledge in this field has been imputed from studies of nonhu-
man mammals. Understanding NIF characteristics and responses 
to light is crucial for the development and optimization of light 
therapy strategies. NIF responses to light in humans have mainly 
been tested using continuous or intermittent light exposures, 
ranging from the order of minutes up to more than 6 hours of 
bright light (41–43). Most of these studies that used intermittent 
light exposures imply that the circadian system is able to integrate

ticipants were excluded from participation for either not meeting the criteria (n = 4) or declining to participate (n = 31). Forty-two participants participated 
in the study and were randomized to either a flash sequence or continuous light exposure protocol. Of the 34 participants who were allocated randomly to 
the different flash sequence light exposures, 3 failed to comply with the prelaboratory sleep schedule and were excluded and 31 were randomly assigned 
to different sequences of light flashes. Eight participants were allocated to the continuous light exposure. All 39 participants were analyzed. Melatonin 
suppression values in 3 participants from the flash allocated group were aberrant and had to be excluded.

Robust circadian phase shift in response to flashes of light. 
Within the group exposed to 1 hour of continuous light, cir-
cadian timing was changed by –0.60 ± 0.34 hours (delay) (t = 
–5.04, df = 7, P < 0.01, paired t test). Within the group exposed 
to flashes, circadian timing changed by –2.99 to 0.30 hours in an 
ISI-dependent fashion (Figure 3). An initial linear rise to peak 
responses occurred when flashes were separated by 2.5 to 7.6 
seconds of darkness, modeled with a standard linear fit using 
the formula y = m × x, such that m is the slope of the rise. Follow-
ing the peak of responsivity of the system, change in circadian 
phase in response to the light flashes dropped following a non-
linear, power function, as shown by y = y0 + A × xC, where y0 is the 
response of the system to a similar protocol without light admin-
istration (set to –0.11 hours, as this change in circadian phase 
was observed in a separate cohort of subjects who took part in 
this protocol but were not exposed to light; ref. 44), A is a scaling 
factor, and c is the power coefficient describing the decay of the 
response. The slope of the initial rise (m) was calculated as 0.23 
± 0.07 h/s, the power constant (A) was 5.5 ± 6.0, and the power 
coefficient (c) was –0.67 ± 0.40.
Flashes of light do not suppress melatonin in a dose-dependent 
manner. Continuous light suppressed melatonin secretion by 51% 
± 40% (W = 35, Z = 2.31, P < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) (Fig-
ure 4A and Figure 5A). Melatonin suppression was assessed in 28 
of 31 participants in the group exposed to flashes, as melatonin 
concentrations in 3 participants were higher than the assay’s max-
imum sensitivity, even after dilution of the saliva samples. The 
percentage of melatonin suppression fluctuated under the dif-
ferent flash frequency conditions but did not vary systematically 
based upon ISI (Figure 4A). If we limited our analysis to the par-
ticipants exposed to flashes who showed a similar corrected circa-
dian phase shift as those exposed to continuous light (i.e., within 
the 95% CI of the circadian phase change elicited by continuous 
We have recently shown that a sequence of 60 ultrashort 
2-millisecond flashes administered over 60 minutes can elicit 
a 45-minute circadian phase delay (44). Here, we compare the 
NIF effect of ultrashort 2-millisecond flashes to that of an equilu-
minous continuous light 1,250 to 120,000 times the duration of 
the flashes, present a model of NIF temporal integration of light 
flashes in humans, and suggest an optimized and selective chrono-
biological light therapy strategy.
Results
To examine the effects of different temporal patterns of light 
flashes on the human circadian timing system, we exposed 39 
young healthy participants (aged 19 to 36 years) to either a con-
tinuous 60-minute light exposure (n = 8) or a sequence of flashes 
of various frequencies from 0.004 to 0.4 Hz (interstimulus inter-
vals [ISI] = 2.5 to 240 s) (n = 31) (Figure 1). Both continuous light 
and flashes were of equal illuminance (1,700–1,805 lux) and 
composed of similar broad-spectrum white light (Supplemental 
Figure 1 and Supplemental Table 1; supplemental material avail-
able online with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI82306DS1). Light 
exposure was scheduled to be administered during the early 
biological night (Figure 2). Post-hoc analysis determined that 
light administration began 4.70 ± 0.92 hours after the onset of 
melatonin, a time during which light is expected to evoke delays 
in circadian timing (49). Acute changes in salivary melatonin 
concentrations, as well as objective and subjective alertness, 
were concomitantly measured (Figure 2).

the case of a participant who maintained a regular sleep schedule between 0:00 hours and 08:00 hours from day 1 to day 14 prior to coming to the lab 
are shown. On day 15, participants came to the sleep lab (blue arrow) and underwent a first CP procedure (CP1) that included multiple assessments of 
saliva, SSS, and an auditory psychomotor vigilance task (aPVT) in dim light (0.6–1.9 lux). All procedures were timed based on an individual’s average MSP 
from day 1 to day 14. Lights were turned off 4 hours prior to MSP on day 15, and subjects were allowed to sleep (recorded with polysomnography [PSG]). 
Two hours and fifteen minutes prior to MSP participants were awoken for scheduled light exposure (LE). LE ended 1 hour prior to MSP and consisted of 
either 60 minutes of continuous light or 60 minutes of a sequence of ultrashort flashes. On day 16, participants were awoken at habitual wake time, 
provided breakfast and lunch, and then underwent a second CP procedure (CP2) similar to CP1. After CP2, participants were discharged (red arrow) and 
were offered a taxi ride home.

Discussion
This experiment demonstrates that, in direct contrast to image-
forming photoreception, the human circadian timing system has 
the capacity to integrate light over a millisecond time scale. Fur-
thermore, we have demonstrated that a specific temporal pattern 
of light has the capacity to increase the induction of circadian 
phase changes to a greater extent than that observed with con-
tinuous light. As opposed to the response of the circadian timing 
system to light flashes, other NIF responses, including increased 
alertness and suppressed melatonin production, failed to show 
consistent responsivity to light flashes. This type of sequence of 
light flashes would be highly improbable to occur naturally and, 
as such, the response we observed is likely an unintended conse-
quence of the circuitry of the system.
Previous studies in humans have contributed to the elucidation 
of the characteristics of NIF photoresponses, including wavelength 
sensitivity (33, 36, 38), timing (49, 54), intensity (40), and photic 
history (41). A limited number of studies have examined the effect 
of the temporal pattern of light. Previous studies examining the 
effect of continuous long- versus short-duration (minutes) inter-
mittent light on the NIF system have implied that the effective-
ness of light in changing circadian timing declines rapidly with the 
duration of the light pulse (42, 43, 55). We have previously shown 
that much of the effectiveness of light on changing the timing of 
the circadian pacemaker may, in fact, be mediated within the first 
few milliseconds of light exposure (44). Our findings suggest that 
within the NIF photoresponsive structure, the circadian system 
appears to integrate ultrashort 2-millisecond flashes of light over 
time in a nonlinear fashion. This temporal integration is such that 
0.95 seconds of light delivered as discreet flashes evenly distrib-
uted over an hour has the capacity to be more than 2-fold more 
effective on phase delaying the circadian system than an equilu-
minous continuous light exposure 3,800 times the duration of the 
flashes. This is the first demonstration to our knowledge in any 
species that a sequence of ultrashort intermittent light flashes can 
be as effective, if not more effective, in changing the phase of the 
circadian timing system in comparison to a continuous white light 
of the same spectral composition and illuminance.
Circadian integration renders ultrashort flashes more efficient than 
continuous light. The responsivity of the circadian system to the flash 
sequence could be explained by the electrophysiological properties 
of the ipRGCs, which have a sluggish off response, in that they con-
tinue to fire for several seconds after cessation of a light stimulus 
(10, 56). When flashes are separated by a short ISI, the depolariza-
tion of the ipRGCs would become sustained, similar to that evoked 
by continuous light exposure. The higher effectiveness of flashes on 
circadian photoreception could arise from the additional firing of 
cones, which indirectly project to ipRGCs, at light onset and offset, 
thus generating a continuous response boosted by superimposed 
multiple spiking responses at each light onset and offset. Flashes 
seem to offer an ideal stimulus that maximizes inputs from the 
visual system (cones), which is optimized to be maximally respon-
sive to rapid temporal light fluctuations, and the more sluggish 
light: –0.36 to –0.83 h), we still observed that these individuals 
 
(n = 7) did not exhibit a significant melatonin suppression after the 
different flash exposures (W = 12, Z = –0.25, P = 0.81, Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test) (Figure 5C). Melatonin suppression in this sub-
group was significantly lower than that observed in the continuous 
light group (U = 46, Z = 2.03, P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney test).
Flashes of light do not change objective alertness and subjective 
sleepiness in a dose-dependent manner. Median reaction time (RT) 
(t = 4.49, df = 7, P < 0.01, paired t test; Figure 4B and Figure 5B), 
number of lapses (W = 34, Z = 2.18, P < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-
rank test; Figure 4C), and shift in optimum RT (mean of the 10% 
fastest RT) (t = 3.62, df = 7, P < 0.01, paired t test) decreased under 
continuous light exposure. Continuous light did not decrease sub-
jective sleepiness, as assessed by the Stanford Sleepiness Scale 
(SSS; ref. 53; W = 13.5, Z = 1.5, P = 0.19, Wilcoxon signed-rank 
test; Figure 4D). Median RTs, numbers of lapses, and SSS scores 
fluctuated under the different flash frequency conditions; how-
ever, there was no consistent increase in alertness or decrease in 
sleepiness as a function of the ISI (Figure 4, B–D). Median RT (t = 
–0.02, df = 9, P = 0.98, paired t test; Figure 5D), number of lapses 
(W = 25.5, Z = –0.15, P = 0.87, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), and 
shift in optimum RT (W = 16, Z = –1.12, P = 0.27, Wilcoxon signed-
rank test) did not change in participants exposed to flashes who 
showed a similar corrected circadian phase shift as those exposed 
to continuous light. There was no significant effect of continu-
ous light on electroencephalographic correlates of arousal (Δ: t =

initial linear rise to peak circadian phase change (~1.85 hours phase 
delay) was observed when flashes were separated by 2.5 to 7.6 seconds

exponential decay curve as ISI increased (n = 31). Responses of individuals 
(black circles) are plotted with the modeled curve (red line) and 95% CIs

protocol without light administration (data previously published in Zeitzer 
et al., ref. 44) is represented by a gray diamond with error bars (mean ± 
SD). In some participants, flashes separated by an ISI of 5 and 10 seconds 
induced over 2 hours of circadian phase shift. Negative values on the y 
scale indicate a phase delay.

that rods have a substantive contribution in flashes subsequent to 
the first one, given that they are saturated at very low illuminances 
of light and regenerate at a much slower pace compared with cones.
Integration of light information in the retina, however, does not 
exclude the possibility of integration of photic drive by neurons in 
the SCN (61). As with the ipRGCs, SCN neurons exhibit persistent 
firing, even after cessation of a light stimulation (62), providing a 
substrate for temporal integration. Alternatively, some neurons in 
the SCN are activated by phases of darkness (61). While the role of 
these neurons and their implication in entrainment remain unclear, 
it is possible that the combination of the excitation by flashes of light 
with interspersed darkness is able to mediate the observed effects.
A circadian critical fusion frequency. When flashes were sepa-
rated by 2.5 to 7.6 seconds, circadian phase shift was reduced to a 
similar magnitude as the shift induced by continuous light. Thus, 
melanopsin-based system that is hypothesized to integrate light 
exposure of long durations so as to remove the vagaries of behav-
ior (e.g., walking in a shaded area, weather) on light exposure and 
its effects on circadian timing. If the flashes are too far apart (e.g., 
ISI = 240 s), there may be insufficient drive on ipRGCs to evoke a 
change in circadian timing. Although a rapid dark regeneration of 
cone opsin is expected after short bleaches (57–59), if the flashes 
are too close together (e.g., 2.5–7.6 s), there may not be enough time 
for the bleached fragment of cone opsin to optimally regenerate; 
therefore, the loss of the superimposed boost in the response ren-
ders these sequences similar to continuous light. A similar obser-
vation has previously been noted in hamsters exposed to a train of 
300-millisecond light pulses separated by 300 milliseconds of dark 
or 300 seconds of continuous light of equal total photon density 
(60). While it is a possibility that requires testing, we do not believe

the circadian system may “perceive” this frequency of stimulation 
the same as it would continuous light. This is akin to the phenom-
enon of flicker fusion in image-forming vision, in which scotopic, 
rod-mediated vision has a critical fusion frequency (CFF) near 15 
Hz, while cone-mediated vision reaches a CFF near 60 Hz (63). 
Based on our findings, we suggest that circadian CFF, after dark 
adaptation and under a broad band full retinal exposure to a pat-
tern of 2-millisecond stimuli, occurs around 0.13 Hz (7.6 s ISI). As 
with CFF, we expect circadian CFF to vary across species (64).
A dichotomy in the NIF retinohypothalamic pathways. Given 
the technical difficulties in assessing the effect of individual 
2-millisecond light flashes on melatonin suppression or alert-
ness changes, we cannot exclude that transient changes in these 
functions have occurred following each brief light exposure. Nev-
ertheless, the absence of an ISI-dependent change in melatonin 
suppression and alertness over a 60-minute period under dif-
ferent ISIs supports the idea that light-induced circadian phase 
shifting is not subserved by the same neural 
pathways as either light-induced melato-
nin suppression or light-induced changes in 
alertness. Light-induced changes in mela-
tonin production, alertness, and phase shift 
are all thought to be communicated to the 
brain by the ipRGCs (16, 21, 65). While light- 
induced melatonin suppression is often used 
as a proxy for the effect of light on the circa-
dian system, our data indicate that there are 
at least some circumstances in which this is 
inaccurate. It is possible that distinct sub-
types of ipRGCs in the human retina (66, 67) 
may subserve different NIF functions. The 
M1 subtype of ipRGCs is implicated mainly in 
phase shifting the circadian system and has 
a faster response, a lower intrinsic threshold, 
and similar extrinsic input compared with 
other ipRGC subtypes (67). It is therefore 
possible that temporal integration is limited 
to M1 ipRGCs and that activation of these 
ipRGCs with light flashes is insufficient to 
induce light-induced melatonin suppression 
or alertness. An alternative possibility is that, 
as discussed above, the temporal integration 
of light is occurring at the level of the SCN. 
While the retinohypothalamic tract, which 
arises from the ipRGCs, projects to and con-
veys light information to the SCN, it also 
projects to other brain nuclei, including the 
paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus 
(PVN) (68), pretectal area (16), lateral hypo-
thalamic area (LHA) (69), and ventrolateral 
preoptic nucleus (VLPO) (68, 70). The PVN 
is involved in the control of melatonin secre-
tion, while the other areas (pretectal area, 
LHA, VLPO) are all implicated in the regula-
tion of sleep or wake. If temporal integration 
in the SCN is required for the phase shifting 
response to flashes, despite whether similar 
integration occurs in the retina, it is not altogether unexpected 
that NIF responses, such as light-induced melatonin suppression 
and changes in alertness, which may not depend on the SCN, are 
not affected by the flashes in a dose-dependent manner.
Technical considerations. There was considerable variability 
associated with responses to very short ISIs between the flashes 
of light. Some of this variability may be explained by difficulties in 
maintaining eyes open due to sleep inertia or anticipatory blinking, 
which is more likely to occur when the ISI is very short (e.g., every 
2.5 s) rather than long (e.g., every 240 s). We did not record eyelid 
movement but did discuss with the participants the importance of 
remaining awake with their eyes open in the Ganzfeld dome. Light 
is able to penetrate through the closed eyelid in a wavelength- 
dependent fashion, such that approximately 3% to 14% of light 
is transmitted (71). We have recently shown that, given sufficient 
intensity, millisecond light flashes passing through the eyelid have 
the capacity to induce changes in circadian timing (72). Neverthe-

less, if a participant had his eyes closed, the retinal illuminance of 
the stimulus would differ from the corneal measured illuminance 
and could contribute to the variability of the responses to the 
short ISI. Future studies are necessary to discover, and potentially 
remove, this source of variability in the response to short ISI.
It is worth mentioning that, even though we fit the observed 
phase shift as a function of ISI with a linear rise and exponential 
decay function, it is quite possible that other functions may be 
more appropriate for these data. This phenomenological fit, how-
ever, was chosen as most suitable after multiple tests with various 
models, based on known retinal and neuronal physiology. Further 
studies on NIF photoreception are necessary to refine these mod-
els and consecutively the fit of our data.
Flashes that are 2 milliseconds in duration, such as those used 
in this study, are faster than the pupil constriction response (73). 
While the pupil constricts after the flash occurs, we have found 
(data not shown) that there is a persistent pupillary constriction 
for 29.5 ± 3.24 seconds (n = 4) after an individual flash, thereby 
reducing the overall input to the retina, especially for flashes 
with an ISI under 15 seconds. Taking into account pupillary con-
striction induced by both continuous and different sequences of 
light flashes, continuous light would still contain 850 to 18,000 
times more light than the sequences of flashes used in this study. 
We could have, as many laboratories do, used an antimuscar-
inic agent to dilate the pupils to avoid the pupillary light reflex 
and keep it from interfering with the amount of light striking the 
retina. Given the potential effect of antimuscarinics on the phys-
iologic properties of retinal ganglion cells (74), we feel that the 
use of such agents would have created greater uncertainty in the 
interpretation of our results.
A final consideration is that the phase shift observed in our 
study under continuous light was smaller than that observed in 
previous studies (41, 49). This difference, however, is likely due to 
protocol dissimilarities in the intensity of the light exposure (49) 
and light history of the participants that could lead to a different 
sensitization of the photoreceptive system (41).
Ultrashort flashes revolutionize light therapy for chronobiolog-
ical disorders. Whether for mood (23, 28, 75) or circadian disor-
ders (26), light has been shown to be an effective and safe, yet 
challenging therapy. Multiple modulations have been suggested 
for the chromaticity (76–78), intensity (79), and pattern (55, 80) 
of light exposures to render them optimal for clinical and per-
sonal use. Here, we show that modulation of the temporal pat-
tern of light at the millisecond time scale can be manipulated to 
isolate and optimize the effects of light on the circadian timing 
system. Using modern lighting technologies, such as ultra-bright 
light-emitting diodes, flashes can also be incorporated into por-
table mask designs that could be controlled and timed via smart 
phone software to proactively phase shift and resynchronize jet-
lagged travelers to their new time zone, help individuals who want 
to go to sleep earlier on a regular basis do so (e.g., adolescents), 
and work in conjunction with daytime light/dark exposure to aid 
adjusting shift workers. The efficiency of this light treatment is 
especially pronounced, as flashes have been shown to be able to 
phase delay the circadian system, even during sleep, when the cir-
cadian system is most sensitive to light (54), while the eyelids are 
closed and without altering sleep (72). This type of light exposure, 
therefore, opens new treatment possibilities for circadian disor-
ders that will need to be tested in real-world clinical trials as well 
as possibilities for the alleviation of associated sleep, mood, cog-
nitive, and metabolic declines.
Methods
Participants. Thirty-nine healthy adults (25 males and 14 females; 26.4 
± 5.06 years of age, mean ± SD) were empaneled from August 3, 2012, 
to August 12, 2015. Participants were enrolled if they reported mini-
mal to no sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores: 
0–4; ref. 52), alcohol use (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test 
scores: 0–5; ref. 81), or depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemio-
logic Studies–Depression scores: 0–19; ref. 82) and were of intermedi-
ate chronotype (simplified version of Morning-Eveningness Question-
naire scores: 11–26; refs. 50, 51).
Protocol design. Participants took part in a 16-day protocol. From day 
1 to day 14 participants maintained a regular sleep time and wake time 
pattern at home. At-home sleep-wake patterns were monitored using 
actigraphs (Actiwatch, Philips, or Motionlogger, Ambulatory Monitor-
ing, and self-reported sleep diaries, ref. 83). Participants entered the lab-
oratory on day 15. The midpoint of sleep (MSP), defined as the midpoint 
of the average sleep period during the prior 14 days (day 1 to day 14), 
was calculated using the actigraphy data and used as the midpoint of an 
8-hour sleep opportunity in the laboratory (e.g., a subject who habitually 
went to bed at 00:00 hours and woke at 08:00 hours would have a MSP 
of 04:00 hours and be scheduled to sleep in the lab from 00:00 hours 
until 08:00 hours). Participants whose bed time or wake time deviated 
by more than 30 minutes twice across the prior 14 days were not empan-
eled in the study. All in-lab procedures were individually timed based 
on the participants’ MSP. Upon entry into the laboratory on day 15 until 
the conclusion of the study on day 16, subjects remained in a customize 
time isolation suite at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care Sys-
tem. Breakfast and lunch were provided to the subjects, and they had ad 
libitum use of an en suite bathroom. During waking hours and constant 
posture (CP), room lighting provided by standard overhead fluorescent 
lamps was dim (0.6–1.9 lux), so as to minimize the effects of background 
light on the circadian system or melatonin production (40). During the 
evenings of day 15 and day 16, subjects underwent a CP procedure (Fig-
ure 2). The purpose of the CP was to hold constant or remove factors 
that might otherwise mask endogenous circadian rhythms (84). During 
the CP, instead of eating dinner, participants were given equicaloric liq-
uid snacks (Ensure, Abbott Laboratories) every 60 minutes, such that 
the caloric intake that they would have received from their dinner was 
distributed over either 8 (CP1) or 10 (CP2) hours (85). During the CP, 
saliva samples were collected every 30 minutes. Alertness and sleepi-
ness levels were monitored every 60 minutes (Figure 2).
Light exposure. During the night between day 15 and day 16, sub-
jects were awakened by the experimenter 2 hours and 15 minutes prior 
to their MSP (1 hour and 45 minutes after their scheduled bedtime) 
and kept awake for 1 hour and 15 minutes. During the 15 minutes 
immediately following arousal into darkness, participants provided a 
saliva sample and alertness was assessed (see below). During the next 
hour, they received their experimental light exposure while in a sleep-
ing posture. An additional saliva sample was taken and alertness was 
reassessed during the final 15 minutes of experimental light exposure. 
After this hour, they were allowed to return to sleep for an additional 
5 hours (Figure 2). Participants were randomly assigned on day 15 to

Monitoring sleepiness and alertness. Subjective sleepiness was 
monitored by SSS (53). Objective alertness levels were monitored by 
testing RT over 10-minute segments via the auditory version of the 
psychomotor vigilance task using the PVT-192 (Ambulatory Moni-
toring) (87). Auditory psychomotor vigilance task data were analyzed 
using the manufacturer’s software (React, Ambulatory Monitoring). 
Variables derived from the software included mean and median RT, 
number of lapses (nonresponse for 400 ms), and shifts in optimum RT 
(mean of the fastest 10% RTs).
Changes in brain electrophysiological activity were recorded dur-
ing day 15 by electroencephalography (Siesta, Compumedics). Elec-
troencephalography data derived from each cortical electrode (C3/4, 
O1/2) were referenced to an electrically neutral/reference auricular 
electrode. Data were transformed using a fast Fourier transform with 
a window length of 2 seconds, overlap of 0%, using a Hanning window 
type with a maximum frequency of 50 Hz, followed by Welch averag-
ing with a mean averaging type on 30 seconds for a threshold of 50% 
and feature extraction on both power (absolute IU2 and relative per-
centage) and frequency (mean Hz and peak Hz). Using this method 
for each 30-second bin, the absolute power in the different frequency 
spectra was calculated. Frequency spectra were grouped, as is typical 
in such analyses, into frequency bands: δ (0.5–4 Hz), θ (4–7.5 Hz), α 
(8–12.5 Hz), σ (12–14 Hz), β (14–29 Hz), and γ (30–40 Hz). Power spec-
tra bands during the 10-minute auditory psychomotor vigilance task 
immediately prior to and at the end of the light exposure were ana-
lyzed for electrophysiological correlates of arousal (Prana, PhiTools).
Data analysis. Phase shift, percentage melatonin suppression, and 
changes in the parameters of alertness and sleepiness (after light expo-
sure – before light exposure) were plotted against the ISI (e.g., Δϕ = f [ISI]; 
Figure 3). Data were fitted using models, as indicated in the Results. The 
number of lapses was square root transformed (√lapses + √[lapses + 1]) 
and plotted against ISI for a better clarity of the plot. CI was calculated 
such as CI = average ± 1.96 × σ/√n (where σ is the standard deviation 
of the data and n is the number of data points). Negative change values 
for RT, number of lapses, and SSS indicate a faster RT, a decrease in the 
number or lapses, and a decrease in sleepiness, respectively. Negative 
percentage of melatonin suppression values indicate less melatonin 
suppression. Statistics, data fitting, and illustrations were done using 
OriginPro 8 SR2 (v8.0891, OriginLab). Figure 5 was done using Sigma-
Plot 11.0 (Systat Software). All data are presented as mean ± SD.
Statistics. Group differences in age, morning or evening prefer-
ence, and reported prior-month sleep quality were compared using 
a Mann-Whitney test. Sex distribution between the two groups was 
compared using a χ2 test. Phase angle of light exposure between 
groups and melatonin phase change between nights in the group 
receiving continuous light were analyzed using a 2-tailed, paired t test 
after checking for normal distribution of the data. Nonnormally dis-
tributed melatonin suppression data and discreet variables of lapses 
and changes in sleepiness assessed using the SSS were analyzed using 
the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Normally distributed continuous data 
of median RT, shift in optimum RT, and electroencephalographic cor-
relates of arousal were analyzed using a paired t test. All statistical 
tests used were 2 tailed.
Study approval. The study protocol was reviewed and approved 
by the Stanford University Institutional Review Board and conforms 
to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Subjects 
signed informed consent forms prior to any procedures.
receive either continuous light (n = 8, aged 27.4 ± 5.0 years) or one of 
twelve different light exposures that vary by the number of ultrashort 
2-millisecond flashes administered during an hour (n = 31, aged 26.1 
± 5.1 years). Flash frequency within the 1-hour light exposure varied 
between 0.004 and 0.4 Hz (ISI = 2.5 to 240 s). Subjects were random-
ized such that at least 2 participants were assigned to each of 12 ISI 
values (Figure 1 and Figure 3). Following an interim analysis, we added 
an extra 3 participants at an ISI of 10 seconds, 3 participants at an ISI 
of 5 seconds, and 1 participant at an ISI of 2.5 seconds. Randomization 
was done by J.M. Zeitzer through a random sequence generator algo-
rithm, and participants were assigned to experimental groups by study 
personnel. All data assessments were done blind to condition. Flashes 
were delivered using the xenon flash unit of a ColorDome (Diagnosys). 
Continuous light was delivered using a broad-spectrum 400 W blue 
metal halide bulb (Eye Hortilux) with an adapted ballast and a cus-
tom-built light box fitted with ultraviolet light filtration (Rosco 03114 
2024), neutral density filters (Rosco 3402), and diffusers (Rosco 117). 
Illuminance of both light exposures was matched to be around 1,800 
lux using the ILT1700 radiometer (International Light Technologies). 
Extensive characterization of the light sources is presented in Supple-
mental Table 1 and Supplemental Figure 1.
Circadian phase shift and melatonin suppression. Circadian phase 
was assessed on days 15 and 16 through examination of the endoge-
nous melatonin secretion profile. Saliva (at least 1 ml) was collected 
every 30 minutes by placing an absorbing swab into the mouth and 
moving it around slowly over 5 minutes. Next, the swab was put into a 
tube (Salivettes, Sarstedt). Samples were centrifuged after collection 
and then frozen and stored at –80°C until assayed. Salivary melatonin 
was assayed in duplicate according to the manufacturer’s instructions 
using the Bühlmann direct saliva Melatonin ELISA Kits (Alpco) based 
on the Kennaway G280 anti-melatonin antibody. All samples from a 
single subject were assayed on the same ELISA plate.
Onset of melatonin secretion was calculated as the time at 
which salivary melatonin concentrations exceeded a subject-specific 
dynamic threshold (Supplemental Figure 2). The dynamic threshold 
was calculated as the mean of the first 3 daytime melatonin concentra-
tions plus twice the standard deviation of these values (86). DLMO was 
estimated for each participant on days 15 (DLMO15) and 16 (DLMO16). 
Circadian phase shift (Δϕ) elicited by the light exposure was calcu-
lated as follows: Δϕ = DLMO15 – DLMO16 (Supplemental Figure 2). 
Phase delays are represented by convention negative numbers, and 
phase advances are represented positive numbers. The phase angle (θ) 
between DLMO15 and the onset of the experimental light exposure was 
also calculated to ensure that the participants were exposed to light 
at a similar circadian phase (Supplemental Figure 2). Average phase 
angle of light exposure (4.70 hours) of participants in both groups was 
plotted on the phase response curve to 1 hour of light, adapted from St 
Hilaire et al. (49) to obtain an average phase shift (–1.23 hours). Indi-
vidual deviations from the average phase angle were used to concom-
itantly obtain a percentage of change from average phase shift. The 
percentage of change obtained was then applied to each participant’s 
phase shift to obtain a corrected phase shift that takes into account the 
differences in circadian timing of the light exposure.
Melatonin suppression was calculated as the percentage of change 
between the sample taken at the end of light exposure and the sample 
taken immediately prior to light exposure: % melatonin suppression = 
(baseline [melatonin] – final [melatonin])/baseline [melatonin] × 100.
