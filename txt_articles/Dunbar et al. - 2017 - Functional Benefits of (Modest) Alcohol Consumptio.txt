Abstract Alcohol use has a long and ubiquitous history. Despite considerable research
on the misuse of alcohol, no one has ever asked why it might have become universally
adopted, although the conventional view assumes that its only benefit is hedonic. In
contrast, we suggest that alcohol consumption was adopted because it has social
benefits that relate both to health and social bonding. We combine data from a national
survey with data from more detailed behavioural and observational studies to show that
social drinkers have more friends on whom they can depend for emotional and other
support, and feel more engaged with, and trusting of, their local community. Alcohol is
known to trigger the endorphin system, and the social consumption of alcohol may thus
have the same effect as the many other social activities such as laughter, singing and
dancing that we use as a means of servicing and reinforcing social bonds.

Introduction
The use of alcohol has deep historical roots, with archaeological evidence for the
consumption of fermented beverages dating back at least 7000 years (Guasch-Jané
et al. 2006; Sicard and Legras 2011; Dietrich et al. 2012). Although the reasons behind
the prevalence of alcohol use are rarely investigated, there is an implicit assumption that
its hedonic (physiological reward) and anxiolytic (reduction of anxiety or stress)
properties are the main reasons for its universal use. However, alcohol also plays an
important role in social contexts by reducing our social inhibitions, as well as being a
potent trigger of the endorphin system (Froehlich 1997; Gianoulakis 2004; Herz 1997).
The link between alcohol and endorphin release is especially relevant, given the fact
that the endorphin system lies at the heart of social bonding in human and nonhuman
primates (Keverne et al. 1989; Panksepp 1999; Depue and Morrone-Strupinsky 2005;
Dunbar 2010; Machin and Dunbar 2011; Nummenmaa et al. 2016). Not only does
endorphin activation make us feel more relaxed (a natural property of opiates), but it
also seems to ‘tune’ the immune system (Sarkar et al. 2012). Alcohol may also have
indirect fitness benefits through the positive effect network size/composition has on
health and survival that has been widely documented in both humans (House 2001;
Kana’iaupuni et al. 2005; Kikusui et al. 2006; Charuvastra and Cloitre 2008; Reblin
and Uchino 2008; Smith and Christakis 2008; Dominguez and Arford 2010; Holt-
Lunstad et al. 2010; Pinquart and Duberstein 2010; Liu and Newschaffer 2011; Tilvis
et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2016) and primates (Silk et al. 2003, 2009, 2010; Crockford et al.
2008; Wittig et al. 2008).
Perhaps because alcohol addiction has serious medical and social consequences,
most research on alcohol use has focussed on the effects of over-consumption (Taylor
et al. 2005; Easdon et al. 2005; Roerecke and Rehm 2010). Nonetheless, the fact that
alcohol continues to be used, especially in social contexts, raises the question of why
humans began to use it, and continue to use it so widely. We can identify two potential
social benefits. One is that alcohol consumption enhances psychological wellbeing and,
directly or indirectly, promotes the building of the close personal bonds that underpin
social networks. In other words, it functions much like the many other behavioural
mechanisms (including laughter, singing, dancing and storytelling: Dunbar et al. 2012;
Tarr et al. 2015, 2016; Pearce et al. 2015; Dunbar et al. 2016) that are used to trigger the
endorphin system so as to facilitate large-scale (i.e. communal as opposed to dyadic)
social bonding. The other possibility is that alcohol in some way affects our social or
cognitive skills in ways that allow us to function more effectively in social situations.
While not all studies have shown such effects (see, for example, Dent et al. 1997), there
is some evidence to suggest that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between
alcohol consumption and at least some forms of cognition (Christian et al. 1995;
Hendrie et al. 1996; Launer et al. 1996; Elias et al. 1999; Galanis et al. 2000; Krahn
et al. 2003; Britton et al. 2004; Lang et al. 2007; Sinforiani et al. 2011). This suggests
that low-moderate levels of alcohol consumption might have beneficial effects on
cognition, and that could include social cognition. For example, because alcohol

119
 consumption makes us more willing to take risks (Abrams et al. 2006; Sayette et al.
2012) and behave more competitively (Hopthrow et al. 2007), it might make us more
willing to risk trying our luck with a prospective mate.
To explore this question, we combine data from a large national survey with data
sampled in pubs and bars. Because our primary interest lies in the social aspects of
alcohol consumption, we focus on the differences between individuals who have a
regular drinking venue (a ‘local’), more casual drinkers who do not and non-drinkers.
Because they provide very different social experiences, we also distinguish between
smaller ‘community’-style pubs and city centre bars. At least in the UK, a community
pub tends to be close to where its clientele live or work, such that regulars visit with
sufficient frequency to know the staff and clientele on a personal basis; these pubs
typically have a distinctly social ambience, with a smaller, quieter venue, are typically
more beer-oriented than wine-oriented, and generally have lower per capita consump-
tion (Jennings 2007). In contrast, city centre bars tend to be larger, have a clientele
drawn from a much wider, more heterogeneous population, and commonly lack the
community ambience of ‘locals’; their business plans typically focus on maximising
alcohol sales. Since conversation is the principal means for creating and servicing
friendships, we also undertook a study of the dynamics of conversation in these venues.
Methodology
We combine data from three separate studies: a structured national survey, a
questionnaire-based study of the clientele in a number of pubs and an observational
study of conversational behaviour in pubs.
Survey Sample
An online survey was commissioned from the polling agency YouGov by CAMRA
(the Campaign for Real Ale). It asked about respondents’ drinking behaviour, their
social networks and their wellbeing, using multiple-choice Likert-type responses. The
survey was conducted over one week in November 2015 using a UK national randomly
stratified sample of 2254 adults (aged 18+), representative of geographic region, gender
and age. As well as background demographic information, the survey asked how often
the respondent visited a pub, where they tended to drink and socialise, and whether they
had a ‘local’. Respondents were then asked how socially connected they felt to their
local community, using the Inclusion-of-Other-in-Self [IOS] rating scale (a 1–7 visual
analogue scale, in which 1 indicates low connectedness and 7 indicates high connect-
edness) (adapted from Aron et al. 1992), how much they trusted people in general (on a
0–10 scale), and how many people they felt they could turn to for help if they needed to
(an index of the size of their support network: Dunbar and Spoors 1995; Roberts et al.
2014). The survey also included measures of the respondents’ current sense of
wellbeing using the following questions from the UK Office of National Statistics’
surveys, rated on a 0 (Bnot at all^) to 10 (Bvery^) scale:

When aggregating poll data, YouGov follows standard practice and applies a
standard weighting (based on the Random Iterative Method, RIM: Deming and
Stephan 1940) to account for variability in sampling across UK regions. RIM can
result in a reduction of sample size, hence sample sizes cited in this paper are
sometimes less than the full 2254 sample.

To study behaviour in pubs at first hand, we carried out two separate studies in pubs. The
first focussed on social behaviour and cognition. We sampled 95 adults (31 women;
mean age 34.1 ± 11.7 years, range 18–63; all native English speakers) in six pubs. Four
were community pubs and two were large city-centre bars. Participants were invited to
take part in a set of short tasks on handheld devices. They were reimbursed £5 for their
time. After they had completed the tasks, they were given a breathalyser test to
determine their alcohol consumption. To make sure that accurate readings were taken,
they were asked not to drink while carrying out the questionnaire tasks. Only 13% of the
individuals sampled exceeded the UK legal blood alcohol limit for drink-driving, and
only three (3.1%) had an alcohol level that was more than twice the drink-drive limit.
The first part of the questionnaire asked about their drinking habits: how frequently
they visited pubs, their weekly alcohol consumption, what they typically drank,
whether they had a ‘local’, and whether they had consumed any alcohol before coming
to the pub. Next, participants were asked to rate how well-integrated into their local
community they felt themselves to be (using the same IOS task as used in the national
survey); a note was made of the size of the social group they were in. Finally, they were
given two picture-based tasks designed to assess their social appraisal of strangers.
In the first of these tasks, participants were shown 20 photos (10 male and 10 female)
of standardised faces from the Chicago Face Database (Ma, Correll & Wittenbrink
2015) and asked to rate them for trustworthiness, approachability and attractiveness on a
7-point Likert scale (1 = ‘Not at all’, 7 = ‘Extremely’). The faces were sampled randomly
from the database since we were not interested in actual attractiveness, but how
individuals perceived faces. This task assessed people’s propensity to make socially
relevant appraisals of strangers in ways that might influence their willingness to initiate
interaction, thus indicating whether their social judgments of others are influenced by
alcohol. Participants were also presented with a validated measure of social cognition
(the Reading the Mind in the Eyes task, RMET: Baron-Cohen and Wheelwright 2001).
For the RMET, subjects view a series of photos showing just the eye region of faces, and
a choice of four words describing different emotions. They were asked to choose which
word best described the emotion displayed in the photo. This task measures the ability to
identify emotions from other people’s faces, a capacity that underlies empathy (putting
yourself in someone else’s shoes) and hence mindreading (or mentalising) – the ability
to understand someone else’s thoughts (a key social skill) (Baron-Cohen and Wheel-
wright 2001). Mentalising is a core process central to human sociality.
Since conversation is at the heart of sociality, we undertook a second observational study
focussed on conversational behaviour in seven different pubs (five large city-centre bars, and
 two local community pubs). The Animal Behaviour Pro app was used on iPhones and iPads
to record the conversational behaviour of 65 focal individuals for 20 min each (total sample
time was 21.6 h). Subjects were not approached and were unaware that they were being
observed. A subject from an obviously interacting group was randomly selected, their
gender recorded as well as that of anyone they were sitting with at the time. For the next
20 min, the researcher recorded who the focal individual was speaking or listening to, as well
as whether anyone arrived or left their group. The researchers used eye contact and speaking
as criteria for who was engaged with their focal individual. The observer also noted when
individuals were not paying attention to the conversation (defined by behaviours such as not
talking, sitting in silence, staring off elsewhere round the room, waiting to be served at bar, or
on their phone). At the end of each sample period, the researcher randomly selected a new
focal individual from another group. At any single venue, researchers conducted roughly 6
samples (representing two hours of data collection), or as many as there were separate
groups in the pub. Two people were never sampled from the same conversation group. A
total of 283 people (135 males), including the 65 focal individuals, were recorded as being
involved in the sample conversations.
Results
Survey Data
Of the 2254 respondents, 708 declared that they were non-drinkers or rare drinkers, 946 said
they regularly drank alcohol but had no ‘local’ they visited regularly, and 447 that they had a
‘local’ (153 respondents did not answer the question). Figure 1 plots the responses to the main
questions as a function of these three groupings. The differences across the three categories in
personal happiness, perceived worthwhileness of life and satisfaction with life were all
significant (Fig. 1a: Kruskal-Wallis ANOV
A, χ2 = 25.88, df = 2, p < 0.0001; Fig. 1b:
χ2 = 12.63, df = 2, p = 0.002; Fig. 1c: χ2 = 36.20, df = 2, p < 0.0001): in each case, pairwise
comparisons reveal a significant difference between non-drinkers and drinkers (p < 0.05), but
no differences between regular drinkers with and without a ‘local’. Scores for trust in others
and engagement with the local community (IOS) also differed significantly between catego-
ries (Fig. 1d: χ2 = 39.18, df = 2, p < 0.0001; Fig. 1e: χ2 = 30.50, df = 2, p < 0.0001), with all
pairwise differences significant (p < 0.01). The number of intimate friends (support clique)
averaged 6.29 ± 7.69SD, which is on the high side but within the range of variation observed
in other samples (Dunbar et al. 1995; Sutcliffe et al. 2012; Burton-Chellew and Dunbar
2015). The differences between the three categories in support clique size are significant
(Fig. 1f: χ2 = 33.40, df = 2, p < 0.0001): the difference between non-drinkers and drinkers
was highly significant, but regular drinkers were only marginally significantly different from
those who had a ‘local’. In contrast, the differences between categories in the rated level of
personal anxiety were not significant (data not shown: χ2 = 1.27, df = 2, p = 0.531).
In order to evaluate the most likely causal relationships between these variables, we ran a
path analysis. We excluded anxiety from this analysis, since it is unrelated to pub use and
correlated (negatively) only with happiness (r = −0.419, N = 2254, p < 0.0001) and life
satisfaction (r = −0.339, p < 0.0001), but included the frequency with which participants
stated that they visited pubs (on a 5-point Likert scale) as the key variable of interest.

 directional. These suggest a causal sequence that runs from satisfaction with life to both
happiness and increased frequency of pub visits, which between them independently
influence one’s sense that life is worthwhile and the level of trust in, and connection with,
the local community (the latter indexed by IOS), which in turn influence the number of
intimate friends one has.
Taken together, these data suggest that there are benefits to be derived directly from
drinking alcohol, especially in relaxed social environments. These effects are clearly
involved in a complex feedback process, and it is clear from the path analysis that
certain types of people (those who feel more satisfied with their lives) are more likely to
visit pubs and benefit from these effects.
In-Pub Behavioural Data
Subjects sampled in the different venues did not differ significantly in blood alcohol level:
a 2 × 2 × 2 ANOVAwith customer type (‘regulars’ vs casuals: i.e. drinking in their ‘local’
or not), venue (community pub vs city centre bar) and sex as factors was not significant
(overall model F3,90 = 1.96, p = 0.126). Only sex came marginally close to significance,
with women having consumed less than men on average (F1,90 = 3.39, p = 0.069).
Those who declared that they were in their ‘local’ (‘regulars’) or who were in
community pubs were in significantly smaller social groups than those who were
casual visitors in city centre bars (Fig. 3a: regulars, mean group size 3.94 ± 2.78SD
vs 6.73 ± 3.74 for casuals; community pubs, mean = 3.56 ± 2.20 vs 5.84 ± 3.77 in city
bars). 2 × 2 × 2 ANOVA yielded a significant model (F3,91 = 9.00, p < 0.001), with
significant individual effects for customer type (F1,91 = 13.51, p < 0.001) and pub type
(F1,91 = 8.55, p = 0.004), but not for sex (F1,91 = 0.03, p = 0.855). Note that those
attending their ‘local’ and those in community pubs were in conversation-sized groups
(which typically have a maximum size of 4: Dunbar et al. 1995; Dezecache and Dunbar
2012; Dunbar 2016; Krems et al. 2016; Dahmardeh and Dunbar 2017), whereas casual
customers and those in city centre bars were typically in parties that were larger than the
normative limit for conversations.
Figure 3b plots how integrated into their local community people felt themselves to
be (indexed by the IOS scale). Subjects in smaller, community-type pubs were more
likely to feel that they were a member of their community than those in larger city
centre bars. However, the 2 × 2 × 2 ANOVA model with venue, customer and sex as
predictors was not significant (F3,79 = 1.51, p = 0.219), with location the only factor
that was (marginally) significant (F1,79 = 3.71, p = 0.058).
Participants were asked to rate the approachability, trustworthiness and attractiveness of
a set of photographs of male and female faces; they also took the Reading-the-Mind-in-
the-Eyes (RMET) test. For all four indices, there was no relationship between mean score
and blood alcohol level (linear or quadratic fits: F1,86 ≤ 1.406, p ≥ 0.226). Nor were any of
the linear or quadratic regressions significant when split by type of venue or gender.
Conversational Dynamics
Across all venues, the average size of conversations was 3.44 ± 1.33 SD (Fig. 4a). This
is again in close agreement with previous samples of conversation group size. Although
the average conversation group size was larger in city centre bars than in community

 pubs (Fig. 4b), the difference was not significant. However, conversations in city centre
bars had a significantly greater range than those in community pubs (Levene’s test for
homogeneity of variances: F1,64 = 8.002, p = 0.006, n = 65 groups).
The size of a social group had significant consequences for its dynamics. Irrespec-
tive of venue, conversations became more fragmented as the size of the group
increased, with continuous stretches of conversation being shorter (Fig. 5a: Pearson’s
r = −0.423, p < 0.001, n = 65 groups) and more people dropping out of the conversation
as group size increased (Fig. 5b: Pearson’s r = 0.285, p = 0.022, n = 65 groups).
Unbroken chains of conversation were also significantly shorter in proportion to the
number of individuals in the group that were not paying attention to the speaker
(Fig. 5c: Pearson’s r = −0.449, p < 0.001, n = 65 groups).

 A two-way ANOVA indicated that the proportion of people who were not engaged
with (i.e. paying attention to) a conversation they were physically part of was signif-
icantly higher in city centre bars than in community pubs (Fig. 6a: F1,64 = 4.85,
p = 0.031); in fact, people in city centre bars spent significantly more time not taking
part in the conversation they were associated with (Fig. 6b: F1,64 = 12.15, p < 0.001).
No one was ever recorded checking their phone in any of the samples in a small
community pub, but in large city centre bars people often did so. Overall, the total time
people spent on their phones was significantly positively correlated with total time
spent not talking (Pearson correlation: r = 0.311, p = 0.012). Consequently, conversa-
tions lasted significantly longer in community pubs than they did in city centre bars
(Fig. 6c: F1,64 = 20.47, p < 0.001). There was a tendency for people to drop out of
conversations more often in the latter type of venue, but the difference was not
statistically significant (Fig. 6d: F1,64 = 2.01, p < 0.161).
In sum, conversations in community-type pubs were longer, more focussed and less
liable to fragmentation than those in city centre bars.
Discussion
The aim of this study was to ask whether there was any evidence that alcohol
consumption has social benefits beyond a simple hedonic ‘high’ or anxiolytic effect.
Because alcohol triggers an endorphin response, we hypothesised that it might increase
the degree of social bonding (feelings of social closeness: see Dunbar and Shultz 2010;
Roberts et al. 2014) and this might have implications for how happy and socially
engaged people become. The evolutionary significance of this lies in the fact that our
social networks provide us with the single most important buffer against mental and
physical illness (House 2001; Fowler & Christakis 2008; Holt-Lunstad et al. 2010;

 Tilvis et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2016). We asked whether the frequency of social alcohol
consumption (indexed by the frequency of drinking in pubs) or the type of venue
(‘locals’ vs bars) influenced people’s social experiences and their wellbeing.
The survey data suggest that respondents who have a ‘local’ that they visit on a
regular basis are more socially engaged, feel more contented in their lives, and are more
likely to trust other members of their community. On some, but not all of our social
measures, those who drink ‘casually’ were more socially engaged than those who
didn’t drink at all, suggesting that there are independent effects due to being a drinker
and having a regular drinking venue. Overall, the number of close friends that people
have (those on whom one can count for support in times of crisis, often known as the
‘support clique’) is of the same magnitude as has been found in previous studies
(present study: 6–7; previous studies: 4–6: Sutcliffe et al. 2012). However, those who
did not have a ‘local’ had significantly smaller social networks and felt less engaged
with, and trusting of, the communities within which they were embedded. The path
analysis suggested that feeling satisfied with life and how often one visits a pub both

 independently influence a set of variables associated with happiness and trust in others,
which in turn influence engagement with the community and personal network size.
The results of the pub behavioural study corroborated the findings from the national
survey: people drinking in community pubs (or ‘locals’) felt significantly more engaged
with their local community than those drinking in city centre bars. More importantly,
those in ‘locals’ were more likely to be in ‘conversational’ sized groups, whereas those
drinking in city centre bars were in groups that significantly exceeded not only natural
conversation group size but also the typical size of the support clique. This difference in
social environment may be expected to have significant effects on the formation and
maintenance of social bonds. In large city centre venues, people were much less engaged
with each other, moving rapidly from one brief conversation to another. As a result, they
have less time to get to know their social companions or establish relationships with
them. We interpret this as being at least part of the explanation for the fact that those who
do not have a ‘local’ they visit regularly feel less engaged with their community, feel less
satisfied with life and have smaller support networks. This may have wider implications
because the size of support networks (cliques) scales up to predict the size of the
extended social network (or active network) (Zhou et al. 2005; Sutcliffe et al. 2012).
It is always possible that these differences in behaviour might be due to personality
differences. Extraverts, for example, have larger social networks than introverts, al-
though the average quality of their relationships is typically weaker as a result (Roberts
et al. 2008; Pollet et al. 2011). We did not include measures of personality because we
did not want to overburden our participants, and hence we cannot evaluate this
possibility here. However, we take the view that any relationship between particular
personality dimensions and our dependent measures (happiness, social engagement) is
likely to be mediated by the role of social drinking, or at least that the two effects are
independent and additive. This remains to be tested, however.
Although there is considerable evidence that moderate alcohol consumption can
enhance some aspects of cognition, including memory, mental arithmetic and inhibi-
tion, even though excessive consumption inevitably has deleterious effects (Christian
et al. 1995; Henrie et al. 1996; Launer et al. 1996; Elias et al. 1999; Galanis et al. 2000;
Krahn et al. 2003; Schreckenberger et al. 2004; Easdon et al. 2005; Lang et al. 2007;
Sinforiani et al. 2011), we could detect no effect on people’s assessment of strangers’
approachability, trustworthiness or attractiveness on the basis of facial cues, at least
within the modest range of alcohol consumption that we sampled. There is an important
contrast between most laboratory studies of the effects of alcohol, where subjects are
required to consume large doses of alcohol (in some cases, by intravenous injection) in
artificial settings, and our real-world observational study involving mostly moderate
social drinking. The lack of any effects of social alcohol consumption on social
cognition and the positive findings on the more general aspects of life satisfaction
and social engagement outside the immediate pub environment suggests that the role of
alcohol is more likely associated with the maintenance of existing relationships than
with the initiation of new ones with strangers.
Because the endorphin system is central to social bonding in primates (including
humans) (Keverne et al. 1989; Panksepp 1999; Depue and Morrone-Strupinsky 2005;
Dunbar 2010; Machin and Dunbar 2011; Nummenmaa et al. 2016) and seems to have a
direct effect on the body’s capacity to resist endogenous and exogenous disease threats
(Sarkar et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2016), anything that triggers the endorphin system is
Adaptive Human Behavior and Physiology (2017) 3:118–133
129
 likely to have been adopted once discovered. This is not, of course, to suggest that
excessive alcohol consumption does not have serious health consequences.
Aside from direct health benefits that might arise from up-regulating the endorphin
system, the principal benefit of the social consumption of alcohol may thus be that it
acts much like the many other endorphin-stimulating activities that we use for social
and community bonding (notably laughter, singing, dancing, and even storytelling:
Dunbar et al. 2012; Tarr et al. 2015, 2016; Pearce et al. 2015; Dunbar et al. 2016). This
is not to suggest that alcohol consumption is an adaptation in the formal biological
sense, but rather that we discovered how it could be used to trigger a mechanism (the
endorphin system) that is an adaptation for social bonding. Indeed, there is now a
widespread view among archaeologists that cereal cultivation was first started in order
to brew beer rather than to provide food (Dietrich et al. 2012; Hayden et al. 2013). We
suggest that, like these other social bonding activities, the consumption of alcohol, once
it had been discovered, came to be adopted as part of the complex set of activities and
rituals associated with bonding our (by monkey and ape standards) large social
communities.
