Background-—Recent randomized data suggest that calcium supplements may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular
disease (CVD) events. Using a longitudinal cohort study, we assessed the association between calcium intake, from both foods and
supplements, and atherosclerosis, as measured by coronary artery calcification (CAC).
Methods and Results-—We studied 5448 adults free of clinically diagnosed CVD (52% female; aged 45–84 years) from the Multi-
Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Baseline total calcium intake was assessed from diet (using a food frequency questionnaire) and
calcium supplements (by a medication inventory) and categorized into quintiles. Baseline CAC was measured by computed
tomography, and CAC measurements were repeated in 2742 participants �10 years later. At baseline, mean calcium intakes
across quintiles were 313.3, 540.3, 783.0, 1168.9, and 2157.4 mg/day. Women had higher calcium intakes than men. After
adjustment for potential confounders, among 1567 participants without baseline CAC, the relative risk (RR) of developing incident
CAC over 10 years, by quintile 1 to 5 of calcium intake, were 1 (reference), 0.95 (0.79–1.14), 1.02 (0.85–1.23), 0.86 (0.69–1.05),
and 0.73 (0.57–0.93). After accounting for total calcium intake, calcium supplement use was associated with increased risk for
incident CAC (RR=1.22 [1.07–1.39]). No relation was found between baseline calcium intake and 10-year changes in log-
transformed CAC among those participants with baseline CAC >0.
Conclusions-—High total calcium intake was associated with a decreased risk of incident atherosclerosis over long-term follow-
up, particularly if achieved without supplement use. However, calcium supplement use may increase the risk for incident CAC.

xcessive dietary calcium intake, particularly from over-
consumption of calcium supplements taken to prevent
or treat osteoporosis, may have unintended health conse-
quences. The well-known “milk”-alkali syndrome1 has been
increasing in incidence attributed to the widespread use of
over-the-counter calcium supplements.2 Supplements con-
tribute to calcium loading (ie, excessive calcium amounts in a
single dose or bolus), which leads to an increase in urinary
calcium excretion in adults with normal renal function, with or
without hypercalcemia, and possibly to soft tissue or ectopic
calcification.3 Gallagher et al recently found that 9% of
women taking calcium supplements had evidence of hyper-
calcemia and 31% had hypercalcuria.4
A direct relationship between total calcium intake (diet
plus supplements) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), how-
ever, has not been established, and this issue remains
controversial.5–13 Recent evidence derived from randomized,
controlled trials, including the Women’s Health Initiative, have
raised a concern for an association between calcium supple-
ment use and increased risk for CVD events.12–14 Among

 calcium supplement users, a high intake of calcium greater
than 1400 mg/day has been reported to be associated with
higher death rates from all causes, including from CVD.15
The purported CVD risk associated with total calcium
intake may depend on the source of calcium intake.3 Intake of
calcium from food sources has not been shown to increase
CVD risk, whereas a signal for increased risk of myocardial
infarction (MI) among calcium supplement users has been
reported.7 In a similar fashion, dietary calcium intake may
decrease risk of kidney stones, whereas calcium supplemen-
tation may increase risk.16 One explanation for this apparent
paradox may be that large boluses of calcium intake through
supplements may transiently elevate serum calcium concen-
trations,17,18 which, in turn, may lead to vascular calcification
and other adverse health effects.
One potential mechanism underlying the association
between calcium intake and CVD risk may be through
progression of atherosclerosis. The coronary artery calcium
(CAC) score is a well-established surrogate marker for burden
of atherosclerosis and is prognostic for CVD risk.19 A few
published reports have not demonstrated any association
between calcium intake and a single evaluation of CAC.5,20
However, little is known about the association of calcium
intake with incident CAC or CAC progression, particularly in a
population-based cohort, and whether any associations with
CAC differ by source of calcium intake (diet vs supplements).
In a multiethnic cohort of men and women, we hypothe-
sized that no associations would be found between dietary
calcium intake and CAC progression over 10 years of follow-
up. We also hypothesized that calcium supplement use would
be associated with increased CAC progression attributed to
unfavorable calcium balance.
Methods
Study Design
The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is a
prospective cohort study investigating risk factors and
progression of subclinical CVD, whose study design has
previously been reported on.21 Briefly, the MESA baseline
information was collected between 2000 and 2002 from
6814 individuals (52% women), aged ≥45 to 84, of 4 race/
ethnicities (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic,
and Chinese), who were enrolled at 6 US field centers:
Baltimore City and County, Maryland, Chicago, Illinois,
Forsyth County, North Carolina, New York City, New York,
Los Angeles County, California, and St. Paul, Minnesota. The
study was conducted under the guidelines of the Declaration
of Helsinki and approved by the institutional review boards at
each site. Written informed consent of all participants was
obtained.
Participants
Of the 6814 participants enrolled at baseline, participants
were excluded from this analysis if complete information on
dietary intake (n=283) was not available. Those with implau-
sibly high calcium intakes (>5000 mg/day) were excluded
(n=347). Participants with abnormal renal function, that is,
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values of 60 mL/
min or less, were also excluded (n=622) given that impaired
renal function could influence calcium metabolism. In addi-
tion,
participants
with
daily
energy
intakes
<600
or
>6000 kcal/day were excluded (n=114). This left 5448
participants available for cross-sectional analysis at the
baseline exam (2000–2002).
There were 3305 subjects who participated in the MESA
Air ancillary study and were eligible for a second computed
tomography (CT) scan 10 years later. Of these participants,
2742 (83%) had complete covariate data and returned for a
second follow-up CAC scan at MESA Exam 5 (2010–2012)
enabling them to be included in longitudinal analysis. Of
these, 1567 were free of CAC at baseline and included
in the incident CAC analysis, and 1175 had a baseline
CAC >0 and were included in the change in CAC score
analysis.
A flow diagram of participant inclusion/exclusion of our
substudy is shown in Figure. Additionally, Table 1 compares
the baseline characteristics of the overall MESA cohort
(n=6814), the MESA Air participants with CAC measured at
Exam 1 and Exam 5 (n=3305), and the sample used for
longitudinal analyses in this article (n=2742).
Dietary Assessment
At the MESA baseline exam, participants’ usual dietary intake
over the previous year was assessed by a modified, validated
120-item
quantitative
food
frequency
questionnaire
(FFQ).22,23 The MESA diet questionnaire for the current
population, with its designed sampling of varied ethnic groups
(independent of validation in general cohort studies), was
validated.24 Consumption frequency and serving size of each
food or beverage were recorded. Using the Block FFQ
design,22 serving sizes were quantified as small, medium, or
large, with corresponding weights (g) imputed according to
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
data. Nutrients were calculated for each FFQ line item
according to a weighted recipe using the Nutrition Data
System for Research (NDS-R database; Nutrition Coordinating
Center, Minneapolis, MN). Complete information about the
MESA diet data is available at https://www.mesa-nhlbi.org.
Use of calcium supplements by participants at the baseline
exam was estimated using a medication inventory approach in
which participants brought in all medication containers used

 in the past 2 weeks to be assessed and recorded.25,26 Total
daily calcium intake for each participant was determined by
adding the intake from daily supplements and total daily
calcium intakes. Total daily calcium intake was categorized
into quintiles based on overall population distribution as
follows: Q1: <434.9, Q2: 434.9 to 650.7, Q3: 650.7 to 936.5,
Q4: 936.5 to 1453.5, Q5: ≥1453.5 mg.
Blood and Other Measurements
Demographic characteristics, smoking status, physical activ-
ity, medical history, and medication use (including aspirin,
diabetes mellitus medications, antihypertensive medications,
and lipid-lowering medications) were collected through stan-
dardized questionnaires at the MESA baseline exam. Level of
education was defined as <high school, some college, or
college/graduate/professional school. Physical activity was
estimated as the total amount of intentional exercise
performed in a usual week and measured in metabolic
equivalent task (MET)–minutes per week. Smoking status was
categorized into never, former, or current smoker.
Physical examination variables (height, weight, blood
pressure [BP], etc) were assessed by trained staff using
standard MESA procedures.21 Body mass index (BMI) was
calculated as weight (kg)/height (m2). After a 5-minute rest,
BP was measured 3 times in the seated position using a
Dinamap model Pro 100 automated oscillometric sphygmo-
manometer (Critikon, Tampa, FL) with the average of the last
2 measurements used as the measure of BP.
Before the exam, participants were instructed to fast for
12 hours and refrain from smoking or strenuous exercise.
Blood samples were drawn and stored at �80°C. Blood lipid
variables were measured by standard chemical methods. C-
reactive protein (CRP) was measured by a high-sensitivity
assay (N High-Sensitivity C-reactive protein; Dade Behring,
Deerfield, IL). Homocysteine was measured by fluorescence
polarization immunoassay with an IMx Analyzer (IMx Homo-
cysteine Assay; Axis Biochemicals ASA, Oslo, Norway).
Diabetes mellitus was classified as having a fasting blood
glucose ≥126 mg/dL and/or the self-reported history of a
physician diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, or the use of
diabetes mellitus medications. Hypertension was diagnosed

on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)
equation.27
CAC Assessment
At the MESA
baseline
exam,
CAC was
measured by
electron-beam computed tomography at 3 field centers
and by multidetector computed tomography at the other 3
field centers,28,29 and these scans were read independently
at
a
centralized
reading
center.
The
methodology
for
acquisition
and
interpretation
of
the
scans
has
been
documented previously.30 Amount of CAC was quantified
using
the
Agatston
scoring
method.31,32
Interobserver
agreement and intraobserver agreement were found to be
very high (j=0.93 and 0.90, respectively). Validation of
phantom-adjusted CAC measurement was made to adjust
for attenuation differences.31,32 At Exam 5, participants of
the MESA Air ancillary study underwent repeat CT scanning,
allowing for a 10-year assessment of incident CAC and
change in CAC.
At each visit (MESA baseline and Exam 5), each participant
was scanned twice consecutively, and the average CAC from
the 2 scans from that respective visit was used in the
analysis.
Statistical Analyses
For our primary analyses, total calcium intake from diet and
supplements was parameterized into quintiles to allow for
examination of possible nonlinear relationships between

 calcium intake and CAC. Presence of CAC was defined as a
detectable Agatston score of >0.
Baseline
characteristics
of
study
participants
were
described using means (SDs) and proportions stratified by
the calcium intake quintile groups. Mean calcium intakes from
total, dietary, or supplemental sources were tabulated by sex.
Relative risk regression using a generalized linear model
and binomial error distribution was used to estimate preva-
lence ratios (PRs) and 95% CIs for the cross-sectional
association of total calcium intake with a CAC score >0 at
the baseline exam.33,34 Similar methods were used to assess
the relationship of calcium intake with the relative risk (RR)
and 95% CI for incident CAC at follow-up, for those without
baseline CAC (57.1%).
For participants with CAC >0 at the baseline exam (42.9%),
we used linear regression methods to evaluate the cross-
sectional association of calcium intake with extent of CAC
burden at baseline as well as changes in amount of CAC over
10 years of follow-up. We also retested this relationship after
log transformation of CAC score because of evidence from
previous reports of the possibility of influential levels of
skew.32
For both the cross-sectional and prospective analyses, we
considered 2 progressively adjusted models. Model 1 was
adjusted for demographic and lifestyle factors, including age,
sex, race/ethnicity, study site, BMI, exercise, smoking, pack-
years, alcohol use, education, income, health insurance, and
total caloric energy intake. Model 2 was further adjusted for
CVD risk markers, including systolic BP, diastolic BP, family
history of heart disease, total cholesterol, high-density
lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, lipid-lowering medication use,
diabetes mellitus, eGFR, total homocysteine, current aspirin
use, and calcium supplement use. Separate analyses were
performed for women and men, as well as for all participants
combined. Interaction terms for calcium intake with both sex
and race/ethnicity were used to test for any possible effect-
measurement modification of the association by these
characteristics.
Given that risk of atherosclerosis may differ by source of
calcium intake (dietary vs supplementation), we examined the
impact of calcium supplement use in several ways. First, we
examined risk of incident CAC associated with calcium
supplement use (vs nonuse) in our fully adjusted model
(model 2) that was also adjusted for total daily calcium intake.
Next, we examined risk for incident CAC for calcium
supplement use in models adjusted for confounders, but not
adjusted for total calcium intake. Finally, we created dummy
variables for calcium supplement users and nonusers by total
calcium intake quintiles and compared all groups to quintile 1
of calcium intake among nonsupplement users. We also
checked for interaction of the calcium intake quintiles with
calcium supplement use.
For all primary analyses, we used a complete case
approach to missing data. However, a sensitivity analysis
was performed using inverse probability of censoring weight-
ing (IPCW) to account for incomplete follow-up to estimate the
impact of attrition of participants.33 Two-sided P≤0.05 was
considered statistically significant. Models were developed in
SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Results
MESA participant characteristics at the baseline exam by
quintiles of total calcium intake are given in Table 2. Total
calcium intake varied by key demographic characteristics,
including sex, race/ethnicity, education, income, physical
activity, current smoking, BP, cholesterol, diabetes mellitus,
family history of heart disease, homocysteine, eGFR, Fram-
ingham Risk Score, and aspirin use. Use of calcium supple-
ments was greater in the higher quintiles of total calcium
intake. The distributions of total, dietary, and supplemental
calcium intake by sex are listed in Table 3. Table 4 shows the
breakdown of supplement use by quintile, separately for
women and men. Women had a higher mean total calcium
intake, which was driven by their higher use of calcium
supplementation.
Table 5 shows the adjusted risk of prevalent CAC at the
baseline exam. In cross-sectional analysis adjusted for
demographics and lifestyle factors (model 1), quintile 2
(PR=0.92 [95% CI, 0.85–1.00]) and quintile 4 (0.90 [0.83–
0.99]) of calcium intake were statistically significantly asso-
ciated with a lower prevalence of CAC >0 when compared to
participants in quintile 1, although this association was
attenuated with further adjustments of CVD risk factors.
Calcium supplement use was not significantly associated with
prevalent CAC (PR=0.96 [0.91–1.02]). For those with CAC >0
at baseline exam, there was no cross-sectional association of
calcium intake with extent of CAC burden (Table 6).
Table 7 shows the longitudinal associations between
baseline calcium intake and incident CAC over 10-year
follow-up, among those without baseline CAC. In the fully
adjusted model, which included adjustment for calcium
supplement use (model 2), the highest quintile of total
calcium intake compared to the lowest was associated with
decreased risk of incident CAC (RR=0.73 [0.57–0.93]).
On the other hand, in this same fully adjusted model, also
adjusted for total calcium intake, calcium supplement use was
associated with a 22% increase in risk in incident CAC
(RR=1.22 [1.07–1.39]). Given that this risk associated with
calcium supplement use was conditioned on total calcium
intake, we also explored a model of dietary calcium only and
evaluated the association of supplement use with CAC
without adjustment for total calcium intake (Table 8). In this

 particular model, calcium supplement use was associated
with a barely significant, slight increase risk of incident CAC
(RR=1.12 [1.00–1.26], P=0.047).
Therefore, we further examined the association of quintiles
of calcium intake with risk of incident CAC stratified by
nonusers and users of calcium supplements, comparing
nonsupplement users in quintile 1 as reference (Table 9).
We found that there was a signal for increased risk of incident
CAC among users of calcium supplements across the first 4
quintiles of calcium intake, with greatest risk noted among
calcium supplement users with the lowest total calcium intake
(quintile 1; RR, 1.41 [1.02–1.97]). For quintile 5, the
previously noted inverse association of high calcium intake
with incident CAC was attenuated among calcium supplement
users (0.91 [0.72–1.15]) versus quintile 5 of intake among
nonsupplement users (0.74 [0.51–1.07]). However, there was
no statistically significant interaction of calcium supplement
use with total calcium intake for quintiles 2 to 5 (P interaction,
>0.05 for all).
Among those with prevalent CAC at the baseline exam,
calcium intake was not associated with an increase in CAC
progression over an average of 10 years of follow-up
(Table 10). This lack of association persisted even when we
considered calcium as a continuous variable and log-
transformed CAC (Dlog CAC=�0.0004 [�0.047 to 0.046])
per gram of calcium consumed per day.
We conducted a sensitivity analysis using IPCW to account
for participant loss to follow-up and compared these to the
primary analysis. Using IPCW, estimates of RR of incident CAC
among participants with baseline CAC=0: were Q2: 0.95
(0.78–1.16); Q3: 1.16 (0.97–1.40); Q4: 0.96 (0.79–1.18); and
Q5: 0.85 (0.68–1.07). RRs did not vary from the adjusted
complete case estimates, using the lowest intake group (Q1)
as the reference.
Effect modification was tested by sex and race/ethnicity,
and no significant interactions were found.
Discussion
In this large, multiethnic study of men and women without
past history of clinical CVD, our results suggest a possible
protective association against risk for incident CAC over a
mean follow-up of 10 years for those with the highest daily
calcium intake, particularly among those who achieved this
without calcium supplements. On the other hand, calcium
supplement use, conditioned on total calcium intake, was
actually associated with an increased risk of incident CAC.
Previous calcium balance studies suggest that healthy
nongrowing adults require �550 to 1200 mg of dietary calcium
per day to maintain zero balance.34 Other balance studies have
shown that calcium intakes greater than 1400 mg/day result in

 positive calcium balance both in individuals with normal renal
function as well as in patients with end-stage renal disease.35,36
Little of the additional calcium provided by calcium supple-
ments, however, is incorporated in bone by adults,37,38 but it
may lead to a positive calcium balance and contribute to ectopic
calcification.
Because of the widespread awareness and treatment of
osteoporosis with calcium supplements among older adults,
this population would appear to be at greater risk of
developing the adverse consequences of positive calcium
balance, including vascular calcification. Calcium supplements
are used by 43% of US adults according to NHANES data.39
The current Institute of Medicine recommendations of calcium
intake for adults 51 years and older in the United States and
Canada are 1200 mg/day for women and 1000 mg/day for
men,40 but a substantial percentage of adults are consuming
total amounts of calcium in excess of 1200 mg/day.12,15,38 In
our MESA sample, the overall mean calcium intake of
participants was slightly less than US guidelines, with mean
intakes of 1081 and 908 mg for women and men, respec-
tively. However, among the highest quintile of calcium intake,
mean intake was 2157 mg, nearly double the recommended
daily allowance.
Calcium may be involved in pathogenesis of CVD through
multiple pathways, including through influences in lipid
metabolism, insulin secretion and sensitivity, inflammation,
thrombosis, regulation of body weight, and vascular calcifica-
tion.41 However, only a few past studies have investigated the
relationship
between
dietary
calcium
and
subclinical
atherosclerosis, as assessed by CAC. A past study from the
Framingham Study did not find any association of total dietary
calcium with CAC measured on a single CT 4 years later,5 but
they did not have a baseline measure of CAC to evaluate for
change. An ancillary study of the Women’s Health Initiative did
not find that women randomized to calcium/vitamin D
supplements had increased burden of CAC on a single CT
obtained 7 years after treatment, but, again, there was no
baseline CAC to assess for change.20 One study (n=144
women) did not find any significant progression of CAC among

 older women taking calcium supplements.42 However, that
study did not factor calcium supplement use in the context of
total calcium intake and was a small study of only women.
To our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluated total
dietary intake of calcium with progression of CAC scores in a
large multiethnic population of men and women. After full
adjustment for demographics, lifestyle factors, CVD risk
factors, and use of calcium supplements, we found that
among participants with a baseline CAC of zero, the highest
calcium intake (≥1453 mg) compared to the lowest intake
(<434 mg) was associated with a 27% decreased risk for
incident CAC, suggesting a protective effect of total calcium
intake in the highest consumers of overall calcium. However,
when considering supplement use, the risk of developing
incident CAC was 22% higher in those who used supplements
than those who did not. When stratified by supplement users
versus nonusers, the highest risk for incident CAC was found
among supplement users with the lowest intake of total
calcium (Q1); conversely, the lowest risk of incident CAC was
noted among nonsupplement users with the highest intake of
total calcium (Q5). These results suggest that any protective
association of calcium intake and incident CAC occurs in the
participants with high dietary calcium intake (excluding
supplemental calcium), which could be a proxy for overall
healthier diets. Approximately 75% of participants in quintile 5
and 60% in quintile 4 were supplement users. Without
clarifying the method of calcium intake, increasing total daily
calcium intake through supplement use might be considered
protective of heart disease.
We were prompted to conduct this analysis because
several recent reports have suggested that an association
exists between high calcium intakes in older adults (ie,
calcium supplement loading), and an increase in the risk of
CVD, including MI,12–14 but this is not without controversy.8,10
Our findings add further support to previously published
reports by suggesting that the relationship between calcium
intake and CVD risk is complex and appears to depend on the
source of calcium intake, with dietary calcium generally
showing a protective effect, but calcium supplement use
being associated with increased risk.
Rather than promoting bone health, excess calcium from
the diet and supplements is postulated to accrue in vascular
tissues. Pathological changes, presumably resulting from
atheromas, initiate conversions of smooth muscle cells to
bone-forming cells or osteroblasts.43 Excessive calcium
loading also has the potential to decrease parathyroid
hormone (PTH) to suboptimal levels and thus increase the

 risk for adynamic or low bone turnover.44 To date, long-term
evidence that calcium loading from excessive dietary and
supplement sources may accelerate pre-existent arterial
calcification has been lacking. CAC scoring is now recognized
as a reliable biomarker of total atherosclerotic plaque burden
and prognostic of risk for all-cause mortality and coronary
heart disease.19,32 Although widely prevalent, CAC typically
occurs in the absence of positive calcium balance. It is
uncertain whether CAC that occurs in the setting of a positive
calcium balance has the same association with CVD risk as
CAC that occurs in the absence of a positive calcium balance.
Low calcium intake (ie, less than 800 mg/day) has also
been suggested to be associated with increased CVD risk.45
This mechanism may be related to excess phosphorus intake
because of a low dietary calcium-to-phosphorus ratio.46 Our
results suggest that a wide range of calcium intakes between
�400 and 1400 mg/day are not associated with CAC over a
period of 10 years.
Low bone mineral density (BMD) has been linked to
vascular calcification in past studies.47–49 Those results
suggest that older women and, possibly, men may be
transferring calcium ions from extracellular bone fluid com-
partments to vascular sites, even in the absence of calcium
loading from supplements. This phenomenon may result from
a chronically elevated serum PTH concentration because of
calcium intakes that are too low relative to high dietary
phosphorus, but this scenario has not been established.
Under these conditions, calcium ions are thought to be
shunted from bone to arteries and other soft tissue sites that
have previously been signaled by phosphate ions to convert
medial arterial cells to osteoblasts and subsequent bone
formation.
When low BMD is identified in older osteoporotic patients,
they are typically treated with additional calcium and vitamin
D as supplements. Rather than increase skeletal mass,
excessive

Calcium Intake and Coronary Calcification

 cardiovascular calcification, especially smooth muscle calci-
fication.44,45 A leading risk factor for stimulating arterial
calcification that is supported by laboratory data is an
elevation of serum phosphate ions that have been shown to
induce calcification in animal models and cells.44,45 Better
understanding of the mechanisms of vascular calcification,
which have not yet been established, may generate better
insight into the long-term development of this process.
A key strength of our study is the ability to evaluate the
association of calcium intake, source of calcium intake, and
CAC in a large, multiethnic sample of US men and women at
both baseline and with repeat longitudinal estimates of
incident CAC up to 10 years. However, our findings should
be placed in the context of several limitations. First, we used an
FFQ for the assessment of dietary calcium intake. Although the
quantitative tool used in this assessment has been previously
validated, the daily variability of dietary calcium intakes
remains high and therefore an issue of potential measurement
error. Calcium supplement intake recall may also be question-
able despite use of a validated questionnaire.25 For example, a
very small percentage of participants (1.2%) self-reported
implausibly low mg values for their calcium supplements (0–
34 mg), where 1 to 2 mg might have been intended to be 1 to
2 g. However, study findings were consistent even when
supplemental calcium was not considered. Our study did not
control for vitamin D intake or seasonal ultraviolet exposure of
skin. We did not have measures of BMD at Exams 1 and 5 to
consider this possible confounder. Other study concerns may
relate to accuracy of self-reported data attained by question-
naires that elicited information on drug usage, concurrent
diseases, physical activity, and other personal health issues,
despite validation of the questionnaires.
Additionally, study participants who took the recom-
mended amounts of dietary calcium may have been engaging
in other unmeasurable health-promoting behaviors (ie, the
healthy user effect), which could potentially explain why a
decrease in risk of CAC development was observed in the
highest quintile of calcium intake.50 Calcium-rich foods are
associated with a healthy diet, and many of the participants
with a high dietary calcium intake may be consuming
vegetables, dairy, nuts, and fish—that provide cardioprotec-
tive benefits. Associations between calcium intake and
cardiovascular events observed in previous research may
possibly have resulted from completely different mechanisms
than an increase in CAC. Even though 50% of our study
participants had CAC at baseline, they were unusually healthy
as a result of stringent MESA recruitment protocols and the
current results may not necessarily generalize to other
populations. Another consideration of our study is that
although the prognostic value of CAC is well established, it
is only a surrogate marker for clinical CVD. Finally, we did
perform multiple testing, and it is possible that associations
found may be attributed to chance. Thus, our findings should
be considered hypothesis generating to stimulate further
investigation in this area. A type 2 statistical error (ie, a false-
negative result) is also always possible.
In summary, results from this long-term study of 10 years
showed a protective relationship between total calcium intake
and incident coronary atherosclerosis, particularly among
nonsupplement users. Even though mean total calcium intake
in quintile 5 was greater than the upper limits of current
recommendations, no increased risk of CAC progression was
found, and the highest quintile of calcium intake actually had
decreased risk of incident CAC among those without preva-
lent CAC at baseline. However, we found evidence that
calcium supplement use was independently associated with
incident CAC, whether or not we adjusted for total calcium
intake. This finding suggests that calcium loading with
supplements may not be entirely free of undesirable side
effects, especially considering evidence for events in ran-
domized trials of calcium supplementation like the Women’s
Health Initiative. Finally, our findings should reassure individ-
uals who are following dietary calcium recommendations by
eating high-calcium foods that consuming calcium from
diet alone at these levels or higher is not associated with
incident CAC.
