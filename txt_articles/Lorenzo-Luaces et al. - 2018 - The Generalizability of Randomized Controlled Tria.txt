Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment:

Arean et al 2016
 Study
Judgement
Support
Random sequence 
generation (selection bias)
Low risk
We randomly assigned participants to 1 of the 3 apps using a random
number generator built into the eligibility survey.
Allocation concealment 
(selection bias)
Low risk
Main article and protocol study do not directly reference allocation 
concealment but participants in this study were randomly assigned 
to treatment and this was a fully remote trial in which there was 
"minimal contact with study staff."
Blinding of participants 
and personnel 
(performance bias)
N/A
It is not possible blind participants to treatment condition
Blinding of outcome 
assessment (detection 
bias)
N/A
(Self-reported outcome)
Incomplete outcome data 
(attrition bias)
Low risk
Effect sizes computed from ITT analyses.
Selective reporting 
(reporting bias)
Low risk
No obvious deviations from published protocol.
Other bias
Low risk
A conflict of interest is reported in regards to one of the conditions 
the iCBT is being compared against. No obvious source of bias.
Montero-Marin et al 2016
Random sequence 
generation (selection bias)
Low risk
"Participants were individually randomized using blocked random 
number sequence.  Randomization to one of the three groups. 
Blocks were administered in each of the regions, using a computer-
generated random number sequence."
Allocation concealment 
(selection bias)
Low risk
"A person who had no other involvement in the study managed the 
random allocation to groups. This procedure was implemented 
through a remote central telephone line. The sequence was 
concealed until all individuals had been randomized."

Selective reporting 
(reporting bias)
Low risk
Due to recruitment problems and resource limitations, were unable 
to recruit number of participants originally proposed. Study 
sufficiently powered to detect a medium-sized effect of intervention. 
Other bias
Low risk
Study co-author employed by company who owns iCBT intervention. 
No obvious source of bias.
Beevers et al. 2017
Random sequence 
generation (selection bias)
Low risk
"Randomization was conducted with an allocation schedule of 
random numbers that was created by a computerized random 
number generator."
Allocation concealment 
(selection bias)
Low risk
"Participants who were deemed eligible were placed on this list by a 
research assistant (J.H.) who did not conduct telephone interviews."
