Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes with important anti-tumour functions. Cytokine
activation of NK cell glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) are essential for
robust NK cell responses. However, the mechanisms leading to this metabolic phenotype are
unclear. Here we show that the transcription factor cMyc is essential for IL-2/IL-12-induced
metabolic and functional responses in mice. cMyc protein levels are acutely regulated
by amino acids; cMyc protein is lost rapidly when glutamine is withdrawn or when
system
L-amino acid transport is blocked. We identify SLC7A5 as the predominant
system L-amino acid transporter in activated NK cells. Unlike other lymphocyte subsets,
glutaminolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle do not sustain OXPHOS in activated NK cells.
Glutamine withdrawal, but not the inhibition of glutaminolysis, results in the loss of cMyc
protein, reduced cell growth and impaired NK cell responses. These data identify an essential
role for amino acid-controlled cMyc for NK cell metabolism and function.

atural killer (NK) cells are important effector lymphocytes
for anti-tumour and anti-viral immune responses. Acti-
vated NK cells undergo substantial changes in cellular
metabolic pathways, undergoing reprogramming to achieve
increased
rates
of
glycolysis
and
mitochondrial
oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS)1–3. Elevated glucose metabolism is a
common feature of many activated immune cells and is required
to provide the energy and the biosynthetic capacity to sustain
immune functions4. Glucose is metabolised to pyruvate by
glycolysis and then either converted to lactate, which is secreted
from the cell, or further metabolised within the mitochondria to
fuel OXPHOS. The amino acid glutamine is also an important
fuel for metabolically active cells as glutaminolysis feeds into the
tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) to fuel OXPHOS. Our previous
research has shown that the changes in glucose metabolism that
occur during NK cell activation are crucial for NK cell functional
responses, including the production of interferon-γ (IFNγ) and
the expression of the cytotoxic molecule granzyme B1–3. This
research provides important insights into why NK cells may be
dysfunctional within solid tumours5–7, where the microenviron-
ment contains low levels of glucose that would curtail NK cell
metabolism8,9. Although NK cell-based cancer immunotherapies
have had success in the treatment of haematological malig-
nancies, the efficacy of these approaches has been less successful
for solid tumours10. Understanding how the nutrient-restrictive
tumour microenvironment affects NK cell metabolism and
function is crucial to developing new strategies that induce robust
NK cell anti-cancer responses.
Although it is now clear that glucose metabolism is important
in the control of NK cell responses, the mechanisms involved are
unclear. The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1
(mTORC1) is an important regulator of immune responses that
has well-described functions in the control of cellular metabolism
in multiple immune subsets4. In NK cells, mTORC1 is required
for the induction of elevated glycolysis following cytokine sti-
mulation1,3,11. In T-cell populations, the transcription factors
hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1α) and cMyc have been
described as central glycolytic regulators12–14. HIF1α is an
important transcriptional regulator of the cellular response under
hypoxic conditions, but can also be expressed under normoxic
conditions in which it has an important function in controlling
immune responses. HIF1α regulates glycolytic responses in
multiple T-cell subsets, including interleukin-2 (IL-2)-cultured
CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), by promoting the
expression of glucose transporters and glycolytic genes12,15. In
T cells, the transcription factor cMyc controls the early metabolic
reprogramming events that occur following T-cell receptor (TCR)
activation by increasing the expression of glucose transporters,
glycolytic enzymes and enzymes involved in glutaminolysis14.
cMyc has also been implicated in the control of invariant NKT
cell development in the thymus16. However, nothing is currently
known about the role of HIF1α and cMyc in NK cell metabolic or
functional responses.
Elevated OXPHOS is also essential for NK cell functional
responses, but little is known regarding the mechanisms involved
in the induction of mitochondrial metabolism in cytokine-
activated NK cells3,17. Glutamine is an important fuel source for
sustaining mitochondrial OXPHOS in activated T cells, but
whether glutamine is an important fuel for NK OXPHOS has not
be studied14.
Herein, we show that cMyc expression is crucial for NK cell
metabolic and functional responses. We identify mechanisms that
control cMyc in NK cells, highlighting an important function for
amino acid transport through SLC7A5 in regulating cMyc protein
expression. Furthermore, these data show that cMyc protein
expression is acutely sensitive to the availability of glutamine. We
demonstrate that although glutamine does feed into the TCA
cycle through glutaminolysis, this glutamine-fuelled TCA cycle is
not important for sustaining elevated levels of OXPHOS in
activated NK cells. Furthermore, we identify an important func-
tion for glutamine in NK cells; glutamine-regulated cMyc
expression acts as a critical metabolic rheostat in controlling NK
cell growth and effector responses. This study suggests that
therapeutic strategies that stabilise cMyc expression in NK cells
will lead to enhanced anti-tumour responses.
Results
cMyc controls NK cell metabolic and functional responses. We
have previously shown that NK cells undergo robust metabolic
reprogramming in response to cytokine stimulation1. As the
transcription factors cMyc and HIF1α have both been described
to have an important role in promoting glycolytic metabolism in
other lymphocyte subsets, we considered whether cMyc or HIF1α
are required for IL-2/IL-12-induced NK cell metabolism and
function12,13,18–20. To obtain the cell numbers required for
biochemical analyses, splenic NK cells were expanded in low-dose
IL-15 for 6 days, as previously described1,2. ‘NK cells’ refers to
IL-15-expanded NK cells herein unless otherwise stated. cMyc
protein expression was substantially increased in NK cells
stimulated with IL-2/IL-12 for 18 h (Fig. 1a). In fact, IL-2/IL-
12 stimulation induced cMyc protein levels rapidly within 30 min
of stimulation (Fig. 1b). In contrast, HIF1α protein levels are not
robustly induced in IL-2/IL-12-stimulated NK cells (Fig. 1c). As a
positive control for HIF1α, NK cells were treated with dimethy-
loxalylglycine (DMOG) for the final 2 h prior to lysis; DMOG
inhibits the prolyl-hydroxylases that target HIF1α for degradation
resulting in the accumulation of HIF1α protein (Fig. 1c). The
relative protein levels of cMyc and HIF1α were confirmed using a
quantitative proteomics approach. The data showed eightfold
more cMyc protein compared to HIF1α in activated NK cells
(Fig. 1d). To determine whether IL-2/IL-12-induced cMyc is
required for NK cell metabolic responses, Mycflox/flox × Tamox-
Cre
mice
were
generated
to
facilitate
the
inducible,
cre
recombinase-mediated excision of exon 2 of the Myc gene.
cMyc-null (Myc−/−) NK cells were generated by treating NK
cells, cultured from splenocytes, with 4-hydroxytamoxifen and
cMyc
deletion
was
confirmed
in
each
experiment
(Fig. 1e). The wild-type controls (WT) were NK cells from
MycWT/WT
Tamox-Cre
mice
treated
equivalently
with
4-
hydroxytamoxifen. There was no difference in NK cell subsets
in Myc−/− vs. WT cultures based on the expression of CD27/
CD11b (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Unstimulated NK cells did not
express
appreciable
levels
of
cMyc
protein
(Fig.
1a,
b).
Unstimulated Myc−/− NK cells were equivalent in size, as mea-
sured by forward scatter (FSC-A), to WT controls and neither
WT controls nor Myc−/− NK cells express the transferrin
receptor CD71, a known cMyc target gene (Fig. 1f, Supplemental
Fig. 1b)21. Following IL-2/IL-12 stimulation, WT NK cells
undergo blastogenesis, which involves an increase in the expres-
sion of nutrient receptors, including SLC2A1 (also called Glut1)
and CD71 and a substantial increase in cell size, as measured by
forward scatter (FSC-A) (Fig. 1g)1. In contrast, IL-2/IL-12-sti-
mulated Myc−/− NK cells were small, with comparable in FSC-A
to unstimulated NK cells, and expressed low levels of CD71
(Fig. 1g). Metabolic flux analysis showed significantly decreased
rates of glycolysis and reduced glycolytic capacity in IL-2/IL-12-
stimulated Myc−/− NK cells as compared to WT NK cells
(Fig. 1h, Supplementary Fig. 1c), which was associated with
decreased messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of the glycolytic
machinery (Fig. 1i). IL-2/IL-12 stimulated Myc−/− NK cells also
had reduced levels of OXPHOS and reduced maximal respiration

 rate compared to WT controls (Fig. 1j, Supplementary Fig. 1d).
The decreased mitochondrial function in Myc−/− NK cells was
associated with decreased mitochondrial mass; IL-2/IL-12 stimu-
lation resulted in an increase in mitochondrial mass, as measured
using a mitochondrial specific dye, in WT NK cells but not in
Myc−/− NK cells (Fig. 1k). Consistent with the observation that
IL-2/IL-12-stimulated NK cells did not induce high levels of
HIF1α expression, HIF1α-null NK cells (Hif1a−/−) had no defect
in
IL-2/IL-12-induced
metabolic
responses
(Supplementary
Fig. 2a-g).
Previous work has shown that NK cell metabolism is integrally
linked to NK cell effector function1–3. Therefore, we next
considered whether Myc−/− NK cells had defective effector
functions following IL-2/IL-12 cytokine stimulation. In the
absence of cMyc, IL-2/IL-12-activated NK cells produced less
IFNγ (Fig. 2a, b), and had reduced expression of the cytolytic
molecule granzyme B compared to WT NK cells (Fig. 2c, d). In
contrast, and consistent with the metabolic analysis of Hif1a−/−
NK cells, there were no functional differences between WT and
Hif1a−/− NK cells (Fig. 2e–h).

 Taken together, these data show that the transcription factor
cMyc, but not HIF1α, is crucial for the IL-2/IL-12-dependent
metabolic reprogramming of NK cells that accompanies robust
NK cell functional responses.
mTORC1 but not Akt signalling regulates cMyc expression.
We next considered the signalling mechanisms responsible for
the robust cMyc expression in IL-2/IL-12-stimulated NK cells. In
other cell types phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and
mTORC1 signalling have been linked to cellular metabolism
through the regulation of cMyc expression22,23. To investigate
this in NK cells, highly specific inhibitors of Akt or mTORC1
were used, Akti-1/2 and rapamycin, respectively. NK cells sti-
mulated with IL-2/IL-12 for 18 h were then treated for 1 h with
Akti-1/2 before immunoblot analysis. While effective Akt inhi-
bition was confirmed by the loss of Akt phosphorylation on
serine 473, no decrease in cMyc protein levels was observed
(Fig. 3a). Similarly, NK cells stimulated for for 18 h with Akti-1/
2 showed no decrease in cMyc levels (Fig. 3b). Consistent with
normal cMyc expression, NK cells stimulated in the presence of
Akti-1/2 were equivalent in size and CD71 expression, and pro-
duced comparable levels of IFNγ and granzyme B compared to
control untreated NK cells (Fig. 3c–g). Interestingly, mTORC1-
signalling was not decreased in the presence of Akti-1/2, as
measured by the phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate p70
S6 Kinase and the S6K substrate S6 ribosomal protein (Fig. 3h).
Therefore, we next considered whether mTORC1 signalling was
important for cMyc expression in NK cells. Rapamycin-inhibited
cMyc protein expression in NK cells stimulated with IL-2/IL-12
for 30 min and 1 h (Fig. 3i). Therefore, mTORC1 activity is
required for the initial IL-2/IL-12-stimulated upregulation of
cMyc. Next, we determined whether cMyc protein expression
remained dependent on mTORC1 activity over longer time per-
iods. Interestingly, after 18 h of IL-2/IL-12 stimulation in the
presence of rapamycin, NK cells now expressed high levels of
cMyc, indicating that mTORC1 activity is not required for sus-
tained cMyc expression in IL-2/IL-12-stimulated NK cells
(Fig. 3j). Therefore, the data indicate that mTORC1 is important
for initial IL-2/IL-12-induced cMyc but that additional mechan-
isms are involved in promoting cMyc protein expression after
prolonged stimulation.
Amino acid transport through SLC7A5 controls cMyc levels.
cMyc protein expression has been reported to be sensitive to
levels of amino acids in T lymphocytes. In particular, transport
through the system L-amino acid transporter SLC7A5 is essential
for maintaining cMyc levels in IL-2-maintained CD8+ CTLs24.
Therefore, we considered whether amino acid availability is
important for cMyc protein expression in NK cells. The hetero-
dimeric system L-amino acid transporters are composed of a
common heavy chain subunit SLC3A2 (CD98) and a light chain
subunit responsible for amino acid transport: SLC7A5 (LAT1),
SLC7A8 (LAT2), SLC43A1 (LAT3) and SLC43A2 (LAT4). Our
proteomics data show that NK cells only express SLC7A5 (LAT1)
(Fig. 4a). This correlates with mRNA expression of the system L
transporters available in the Immgen database. Slc7a5 mRNA
expression is robustly increased after 18 h of IL-2/IL-12 stimula-
tion and continued IL-2 signalling is required to maintain
SLC7A5 expression (Fig. 4b, c). This induction of SLC7A5
expression was confirmed by measuring the transport capacity of
the system L substrate 3H-phenylalanine, which was also robustly
induced in IL-2/IL-12-stimulated NK cells (Fig. 4d). 2-Amino-2-
norbornanecarboxylic acid (BCH), a competitive blocker of sys-
tem L-amino acid transport, was used as a negative control and
prevented 3H-phenylalanine uptake (Fig. 4d). BCH can be con-
sidered a specific inhibitor of uptake through the SLC7A5/
SLC3A2 (LAT1) transporter in NK cells, which do not express
LAT2–4 (Fig. 4a). Next, BCH was used to determine the
importance of SLC7A5-mediated amino acid transport for
maintaining cMyc expression. When cytokine-activated NK cells
were treated with BCH a dramatic decrease in cMyc protein levels
was observed after just 30 min (Fig. 4e). BCH treatment also
resulted in reduced mTORC1 signalling (Fig. 4e). Additionally,
SLC7A5-null (from Slc7a5flox/flox Vav-Cre mice) NK cells sti-
mulated for 18 h with IL-2/IL-12 did not induce cMyc protein
expression (Fig. 4f). One reason why SLC7A5 is required for

 mTORC1 activity in CD8+ T cells is that it transports the amino
acid leucine into the cell and there are well-described mechanisms
linking leucine to the regulation of mTORC1 activity25. Indeed,
NK cells activated in media without leucine were deficient for
mTORC1 signalling but, interestingly, these cells had normal
levels of cMyc (Fig. 4g). SLC7A5 is an obligate anti-porter, which
means that it must transport an amino acid out of the cell, most
commonly glutamine, in order to transport another amino acid
into the cell26. Therefore, intracellular glutamine is important in
sustaining SLC7A5-mediated amino acid transport. IL-2/IL-
12 stimulation robustly increased the rate of glutamine transport
into the cell (Fig. 4h). Glutamine uptake was not mediated by
system L transporters as it was not affected by BCH treatment
(Fig. 4h). Glutamine is predominantly transported by system ASC
(SLC1A4 and SLC1A5) and system A and N (SLC38A1,
SLC38A2, SLC38A5 and SLC38A7) transporters27,28. Quantita-
tive proteomics data showed that the predominant glutamine
transporters in activated NK cells are SLC1A5 and SLC38A2
(Supplementary Fig. 3a). Next, we tested whether glutamine is
important for sustaining cMyc protein expression in IL-2/IL-12-
activated NK cells. Glutamine withdrawal resulted in a rapid
decrease in cMyc protein expression within 30 min (Fig. 4i). In
contrast, when IL-2/IL-12-activated NK cells were deprived of
leucine or treated with rapamycin for 1 h, cMyc protein expres-
sion was not decreased (Fig. 4j). Together, these data show that
glutamine, but not mTORC1 activity, is required for sustaining
cMyc expression in cytokine active NK cells (Figs. 3 and 4). In
T cells, glutamine has been shown to regulate cMyc expression
through a mechanism involving fuelling of the hexosamine
pathway to support protein O-GlcNAcylation29. To investigate
whether the loss of cMyc protein following glutamine withdrawal
might be explained by decreased protein O-GlcNAcylation, a flow
cytometry-based assay was used to measure global O-GlcNAcy-
lation levels. While glutamine withdrawal does result in reduced
protein O-GlcNAcylation after 18 h, shorter periods of glutamine
withdrawal did not affect protein O-GlcNAcylation, indicating
that this mechanism is unlikely to account for the rapid loss in
cMyc protein levels (Fig. 4i, j, Supplementary Fig. 3b). Taken
together, the data argue that while SLC7A5 transport of leucine is
required for mTORC1 signalling, glutamine and the transport of
other amino acids through SLC7A5 are required to sustain cMyc
protein expression.
Given that cMyc is crucial for metabolic reprogramming in IL-
2/IL-12-stimulated NK cells, we next considered the impact of
BCH on NK cell metabolic responses. NK cells stimulated with
IL-2/IL-12 in the presence of BCH for 18 h were reduced in size
and had decreased expression of CD71 compared to untreated
controls (Fig. 5a). Inhibition of system L-amino acid uptake also
resulted in reduced levels of cellular metabolism; BCH treated NK
cell had reduced rates of glycolysis and glycolytic capacity, and
reduced rates of OXPHOS and maximal respiration (Fig. 5b–e).
These data are consistent with our observations in Myc−/− NK
cells (Fig. 1). Similar results were obtained when NK cells were
stimulated
with
IL-2/IL-12
in
the
absence
of
glutamine
(Supplementary Fig. 3c-g). Consistent with these observed
metabolic defects, NK cells stimulated with IL-2/IL-12 in the
presence of BCH or the absence of glutamine had reduced IFNγ
production and granzyme B expression (Fig. 5f–i Supplementary
Fig. 3h, i).
Next we performed experiments to confirm that amino acid-
controlled cMyc is also required for metabolic and functional NK
cell responses in NK cells isolated directly from mouse spleens.
Splenocytes from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-cMyc reporter
mice were used to measure cMyc levels in NK cells. cMyc protein
expression was significantly increased in splenic NK cells
stimulated with IL-2/IL-12 for 18 h, but not in those stimulated
in the presence of BCH (Fig. 6a, b). Additionally, the expression
of the cMyc target gene CD71 was found to parallel the observed
cMyc protein expression (Fig. 6c). The metabolic pathways of

 splenic NK cells stimulated with IL-2/IL-12 for 18 h were then
analysed. As seen with cultured NK cells, IL-2/IL-12-stimulated
splenic NK cells showed robust increases in the rates of both
glycolysis and OXPHOS as well as in glycolytic capacity and
maximal respiration rates (Fig. 6d–g). This metabolic response
was
prevented
when
system
L-amino
acid
transport
was
inhibited with BCH in line with the fact that these NK cells do
not express cMyc (Fig. 6d–g). Parallel experiments showed
that BCH treatment also inhibited IFNγ production and
granzyme B expression in IL-2/IL-12-stimulated splenic NK cells
(Fig. 6h, i).
cMyc protein is controlled by GSK3-targeted degradation. The
data show that in activated NK cells, cMyc protein levels are
rapidly lost following BCH treatment or glutamine withdrawal
arguing that cMyc is being actively degraded. Indeed, studies in
other cell types suggest that cMyc protein levels are extremely
labile and determined by constitutive cMyc protein synthesis and
degradation30. To investigate whether proteasomal degradation
plays a role in the regulation of cMyc levels, IL-2/IL-12-activated
NK cells were treated with BCH or deprived of glutamine in the
presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. In the
control cells, MG132 treatment resulted in a significant increase
in cMyc, confirming that cMyc is actively degraded in these NK
cells (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). Additionally, in NK cells treated
with BCH or deprived of glutamine for 1 h, MG132 treatment
resulted in a significant rescue of cMyc protein levels (Supple-
mentary Fig. 4a, b). The activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3
(GSK3) has been linked to the regulation of cMyc degradation.
GSK3 has been reported to phosphorylate cMyc on serine 58 to
promote degradation in the proteasome31,32. Indeed, the highly
specific GSK3 inhibitor CT9902133 prevented the rapid decrease
in cMyc protein expression in cells treated with BCH or deprived
of glutamine (Supplementary Fig. 4c, d). Together, these data
argue that a balance between high rates of cMyc synthesis and
GSK3-targeted cMyc degradation determines cMyc protein levels
in activated NK cells.
Glutaminolysis does not sustain OXPHOS in activated NK
cells. These data show a role for glutamine in controlling cMyc-
dependent metabolic responses in IL-2/IL-12-stimulated NK cells.
As glutamine is also a fuel that feeds into the TCA cycle through
glutaminolysis in other lymphocyte subsets14,34, we next con-
sidered the relative importance of glutamine in NK cells as a
signalling molecule to sustain cMyc protein expression vs. a fuel
to sustain OXPHOS. NK cells stimulated with IL-2/IL-12 for 18 h
were switched into glutamine-free media for 1 h prior to meta-
bolic flux analysis for rates of OXPHOS. Alternatively, NK cells
Fig. 4 SLC7A5 activity is required for IL-2/IL-12-induced cMyc expression.
a NK cells were activated for 18 h with IL-2/IL-12 and the number of protein
copies per cell were determined using quantitative proteomic analysis:
SLC7A5, SLC7A8, SLC43A1 and SLC43A2. b NK cells were left
unstimulated (US) or were stimulated with IL-2/IL-12 for 18 h and Slc7a5
mRNA levels analysed by qPCR. c NK cells were activated with IL-2/IL-12
for 20 h and then switched into media containing cytokines as shown for a
further 8 h. Slc7a5 mRNA levels were analysed by qPCR. d Purified NK cells
were stimulated with IL-2/IL-12 for 18 h and uptake of 3H-labelled
phenylalanine was measured in the presence or absence of the system L
competitor BCH (10 mM). e NK cells were stimulated with IL-2/IL-12 for 18
h and the system L blocker BCH (25 mM) was added for the final 30 or 60
min as indicated before immunoblot analysis of cMyc, phosphorylated S6
ribosomal protein on serine 235/6 (pS6) and total S6 ribosomal protein
(S6). f Slc7a5−/− (Slc7a5flox/flox × Vav-Cre) or WT (Slc7a5WT/WT × Vav-
Cre) NK cells were left unstimulated or were stimulated for 18 h with IL-2/
12 before immunoblot analysis of cMyc and β-actin protein expression and
qPCR analysis of Slc7a5 mRNA expression. g NK cells were stimulated with
IL-2/IL-12 in the presence or absence of leucine for 18 h before immunoblot
analysis of cMyc, pS6 and Akt. h Purified NK cells were stimulated with IL-
2/IL-12 for 18 h and glutamine uptake was measured using 14C-labelled
glutamine in the presence or absence of BCH (10 mM). i NK cells
stimulated with IL-2/IL-12 for 18 h were cultured in the presence or absence
of glutamine for 30 or 60 min as indicated, before immunoblot analysis for

 were treated with the glutaminase inhibitor bis-2-(5-phenylace-
tamido-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl
sulphide
(BPTES),
which
inhibits the first enzyme of the glutaminolysis pathway, or a
glutamine analogue that is a general inhibitor of glutamine-
utilising enzymes, 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON). The rate of
OXPHOS was not significantly affected by glutamine deprivation
or the addition of BPTES or DON (Fig. 7a–d, Supplementary
Fig. 5a, b). The inhibition of glutaminase with BPTES, but not
glutamine deprivation or DON treatment, had a small but sig-
nificant impact upon the maximal respiration rate (Fig. 7a–d,
Supplementary Fig. 5b). Glutamine is an important fuel in T cells
and, indeed, BPTES and DON treatment inhibited T-cell pro-
liferation (Supplementary Fig. 5c, d). These data suggested that
glutamine is not a key fuel for sustaining elevated levels of
OXPHOS in cytokine-stimulated NK cells.
To further explore glutamine metabolism we performed a 13C
carbon-tracing
metabolomics
experiment
using
uniformly
labelled 13C5-glutamine. NK cells were stimulated for 16 h with
IL-2/IL-12 in normal media and then switched into media
containing 13C5-glutamine for 30 min, 2 h or 8 h. The data
showed that glutamine does feed into the TCA cycle in NK cells
giving rise to m+4 labelled TCA cycle intermediates (Fig. 7e).
However, the mean enrichment of
13C within citrate was
significantly less than in other TCA cycle intermediates (Fig. 7f).
These data fit with the recent report that demonstrated that IL-2/
IL-12-stimulated
NK
cells
metabolise
glucose
to
generate
cytosolic citrate through the citrate malate shuttle2. Indeed, when
comparing the incorporation of 13C from 13C6-glucose and 13C5-
glutamine into the TCA cycle it is apparent that while the carbons
from glutamine feed into the TCA cycle, the carbons from glucose
are enriched in citrate and are not passed to downstream TCA
cycle intermediates (Fig. 7g)2. Taken together, these data argue
that cytokine-activated NK cells concurrently utilise the glucose-
fuelled citrate malate shuttle and the glutamine-fuelled TCA cycle
(Fig. 7e–g)2.
Considering that the citrate malate shuttle can also drive
OXPHOS2, we next explored the relative contributions of the
glutamine-fuelled TCA cycle and the glucose-fuelled citrate
malate shuttle in sustaining elevated OXPHOS in IL-2/IL-12-
activated NK cells. NK cells were stimulated with IL-2/IL-12 for

 18 h and then metabolic rates were measured before and after the
addition of BPTES to inhibit glutamine-fuelled TCA cycle, or
SB204990 to inhibit ACLY and the citrate malate shuttle. The
addition of SB204990, but not BPTES, resulted in a decrease in
basal OXPHOS rates (Fig. 7h). In contrast to the small effect of
BPTES, SB204990 treatment resulted in a substantial decrease in
the maximal respiration rate (Fig. 7h). Another ACLY inhibitor
BMS303141 resulted in a similarly large decrease in maximal
respiration rates (Supplementary Fig. 5e). Together, these data
indicate that OXPHOS is primarily maintained by the glucose-
fuelled citrate malate shuttle, and not glutaminolysis, in IL-2/IL-
12-activated NK cells. If so, it would be predicted that the
concentrations of citrate and malate would be substantially
greater than those of other TCA cycle metabolites due to the fact
that they are also part of the citrate malate shuttle (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 5f). Indeed, this was found to be the case; citrate and

Glutamine-dependent cMyc sustains NK cell responses. While
these data argue that glutamine is not an important fuel in NK
cells, glutamine is required for the expression of the metabolic
regulator cMyc (Fig. 1). Therefore, we investigated whether glu-
tamine is required for maintaining prolonged NK cell metabolism
through the regulation of cMyc. NK cells were stimulated with IL-

 free media or in media with glutamine in the presence or absence
of BPTES or DON. NK cells deprived of glutamine were small
compared to NK cells cultured with glutamine (Fig. 8a). In
contrast, NK cells cultured with glutamine and treated with
BPTES or DON were comparable in size to control cells (Fig. 8a,
Supplementary Fig. 6a). IL-2/IL-12-activated NK cells treated
with BPTES or DON for 1 h maintain high levels of cMyc protein
expression (Fig. 8b, Supplementary Fig. 6b) unlike those deprived
of glutamine for 1 h (Fig. 4i). Additionally, the metabolic sig-
nature of IL-2/IL-12-activated NK cells deprived of glutamine for
20 h was very different from those treated with BPTES for 20 h.
Consistent with the data showing that glutaminolysis does feed
into the TCA cycle and has a minor role in supporting OXPHOS,
BPTES treatment for 20 h resulted in a small decrease in both
OXPHOS and maximal respiration rates (Fig. 8c). However, the
impact of glutamine deprivation was much greater than that of
BPTES treatment; NK cells deprived of glutamine had a twofold
decrease in OXPHOS and a threefold decrease in maximal
respiration (Fig. 8c). The data presented herein suggest that the
substantial effect of glutamine deprivation on NK cell metabolism
is due to the loss of cMyc expression in glutamine-deprived NK
cells. Supporting this, glutamine-deprived NK cells but not
BPTES-treated NK cells had decreased rates of glycolysis and
glycolytic capacity (Fig. 8d), which are controlled by cMyc in NK
cells (Fig. 1g, h). IL-2/IL-12-activated NK cells that were deprived
of glutamine for 20 h had reduced levels of IFNγ production and
expressed lower levels of granzyme B (Fig. 8e, f). In contrast, IL-2/
IL-12-activated NK cells treated with BPTES for 20 h maintained
these NK cell effector functions (Fig. 8e, f). Additionally,
glutamine-deprived but not BPTES-treated NK cells had reduced
cytotoxicity towards tumour target cells (Fig. 8g). Similar results
were obtained using the more general inhibitor of glutamine

Taken together, these data show that glutamine availability, but
not glutamine metabolism, is crucial for NK cell anti-tumour
functions.
Discussion
In this study, we have shown a key role for cMyc in supporting
the metabolic changes required for NK cell responses following
IL-2/IL-12 cytokine stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 7). This
combination of cytokines drives a robust metabolic response
because IL-12 induces the expression of the high-affinity IL-2
receptor CD25 facilitating IL-2-dependent metabolic repro-
gramming1. Interestingly, the high rates of cellular glycolysis in
IL-2-maintained CTLs are dependent on HIF1α rather than
cMyc12. Nevertheless, cMyc is important for metabolic responses
in other lymphocyte subsets such as in TCR-stimulated T cells14.
It is worth noting that while the IL-2 stimulus is shared between
IL-2/IL-12-stimulated NK cells and IL-2-maintained CTLs, the
metabolic requirements of these cells will be distinct, as NK cells
are engaging in blastogenesis while CTLs are rapidly proliferating.
Both cMyc and HIF1α promote glycolysis and have overlapping
target genes but they also have unique functions. For instance,
cMyc, and not HIF1α, has been linked to the regulation of
mitochondrial biogenesis and OXPHOS35. Therefore, it is likely
that cMyc is essential at this early point during NK cell activation
as it promotes a metabolic response that matches the metabolic
requirements of cellular blastogenesis. While the data show that
HIF1α is not required for the initial metabolic response accom-
panying NK cell activation, this does not preclude a role for
HIF1α at other points during NK cell response. For instance, it
would be of interest to investigate whether HIF1α plays a role in
responses mediated by trained (or memory-like) NK cells.
cMyc protein expression can be regulated by both translational
and multiple post-translational mechanisms36. The data show
that mTORC1 activity is required for the initial increase in cMyc
protein expression following NK cells activation with IL-2/IL-12.
mTORC1 signalling regulates 5’ cap-dependent translation,
which is important for the translation of cMyc mRNA37–39.
However,
after
prolonged
periods
of
cytokine
stimulation
mTORC1 signalling is not required for cMyc protein expression.
Our previous work showed that in CTLs, cMyc protein levels are
also independent of mTORC1 signalling12,40. Interestingly, in
transformed CD8+ leukaemic T cells, cMyc protein expression is
dependent on mTORC1 activity41. This highlights that in CD8+
T cells, depending on the context, cMyc protein expression can
also be regulated by mTORC1-dependent and -independent
mechanisms. Herein, we show that in activated NK cells, cMyc
protein is continuously subjected to GSK3-targeted proteasomal
degradation. This means that to maintain high levels of cMyc
protein, NK cells must sustain high rates of protein synthesis. The
delivery of amino acids, which are essential for supporting high
rates of protein synthesis, are required to sustain high levels of
cMyc in NK cells. IL-2/IL-12-stimulated NK cells upregulate the
expression and activity of the SLC7A5 amino acid transporter
and SLC7A5-mediated amino acid transport facilitates elevated
cMyc protein expression. In CTLs, SLC7A5-mediated amino acid
transport has previously been shown to be critical for cMyc
expression and for metabolic and functional responses40. Inter-
estingly, SLC7A5 mRNA expression is also robustly induced in
NK cells in mice following murine cytomegalovirus infection
(www.immgen.org), suggesting that this transporter may have an
important role in NK cell responses to viral infection.
This study shows that PI3K/Akt signalling is not required for
IL-2/IL-12-induced NK cell metabolic or effector responses. This
is in contrast to our previous research showing an important role
for mTORC1 for cytokine-induced NK cell responses1. It is

 commonly believed that the mTORC1 kinase is activated down-
stream of PI3K/Akt signalling in immune cells, but this is not
always the case. This idea of a PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 linear pathway
is perpetuated by the fact that mTORC1 and PI3K/Akt signalling
can have overlapping functions in lymphocytes, though the
mechanisms involved can be quite distinct12,42–44. Here, we show
that mTORC1 signalling is robustly induced in IL-2/IL-12-sti-
mulated NK cells even in the presence of an Akt inhibitor,
indicating that mTORC1 and Akt signal independently, thus
explaining the phenotypic differences of NK cells stimulated in
the presence of Akt vs. mTORC1 inhibitors1. These results are in
line with our previous study in IL-2-cultured CTLs, which

 showed mTORC1 signalling was unaffected following pharma-
cological or transgenic inhibition of PI3K/Akt signalling12.
Instead, the data in CTL and now in NK cells argue that IL-2
regulation of leucine transport into the cell via SLC7A5 is a key
mechanism in promoting mTORC1 signalling40. While the data
here show that Akt signalling is not required for cytokine-induced
NK cell metabolism and function, this does not preclude a role for
PI3K/Akt signalling for NK cell metabolic responses in a different
context such as in receptor activated NK cells. Indeed, PI3K has
been shown to be important for NK cell receptor-mediated IFNγ
production45.
While the data show that glutamine is required for sustaining
cMyc expression, it is not an important fuel for cytokine-
stimulated NK cells. Glutamine does feed into the TCA cycle
through glutaminolysis, but this metabolic pathway is a minor
contributor to OXPHOS rates. Instead, the citrate malate shuttle,
a glucose-fuelled metabolic pathway recently described in IL-2/
IL-12-activated NK cells2, is the main pathway responsible for
sustaining elevated rates of OXPHOS. A key signalling molecule
involved in the control of the citrate malate shuttle is the Srebp
transcription factor (Sterol element binding protein)2. Taken
together, cMyc and Srebp are two key factors in determining
metabolic responses in IL-2/IL-12-stimulated NK cells; cMyc
promotes glycolysis and mitogenesis while Srebp controls the
metabolic switch to the citrate malate shuttle to fuel OXPHOS.
NK cells isolated from human solid tumours have been found
to be defective in their pro-inflammatory functions including
IFNγ production and tumour cytotoxicity5–7. Tumour cells are
known to have a high demand for glutamine, in addition to
glucose, and so it is likely that the tumour microenvironment can
also have low levels of glutamine46,47. The data presented here
argue that glutamine-restricted tumour microenvironments will
inhibit cMyc expression in NK cells, leading to reduced NK cell
metabolism and the inhibition of anti-tumour NK cell functions.
Indeed, the data show that when IL-2/IL-12-activated NK cells
were switched into glutamine-deficient conditions, metabolic
rates of OXPHOS and glycolysis decreased dramatically and IFNγ
production and tumour cytotoxicity was substantially inhibited.
Given that glutamine is a crucial fuel for tumour cells, targeting
glutamine metabolism is an attractive anti-cancer strategy that is
being actively pursued46,48. However, it is important to consider
the likely impact of such strategies on the anti-tumour immune
response. Anti-cancer drugs targeting glutamine metabolism will
also inhibit the growth, proliferation and function of T cells14,49.
However, this study reveals that NK cell metabolism and func-
tional responses are not affected by inhibitors of glutamine
metabolism. This finding has positive implications for the efficacy
of anti-cancer therapies using inhibitors of glutamine metabo-
lism. In fact, it might be predicted that such inhibitors might lead
to increased levels of glutamine within the tumour micro-
environment, due to decreased utilisation by tumour cells, which
would facilitate the expression of cMyc and anti-tumour effector
functions in tumour-infiltrating NK cells. This will be an exciting
area to address in future studies.
Methods
Mice. C57BL/6J male mice were purchased from Harlan (Bicester, UK) or were
bred in house. Mice with loxP sites inserted flanking exon 2 of the Myc gene
(B6.129S6-Myctm2Fwa/Mmjax)50, mice with loxP sites inserted flanking exon 2 of
the Hif1a gene (B6.129−Hif1atm3Rsjo)51, mice with loxP sites inserted flanking exon
1 of the Slc7a5 gene (B6.129P2-Slc7a5tm1.1Daca/J)40, mice in which a fusion protein
of Myc and enhanced green fluorescent protein is expressed in exon 2 of the Myc
gene (B6;129-Myctm1Slek/J)52 and transgenic mice expressing cre recombinase
under the control of the vav promoter (B6.CgTg(Vavl-cre)A2 Kio/J)53 were from
The Jackson Laboratory. Transgenic mice expressing a tamoxifen inducible cre-
recombainse (Gt(ROSA)26Sor<tm2(cre/ERT2) Brn/Cnrm)54 were obtained from
the European Mouse Mutant Archive (EMMA). All mice used in this study were
between 8 and 12 weeks of age and were bred and maintained in compliance with
EU and the Health Products Regulatory Authority regulations with the approval of
the University of Dublin’s ethical review board and in accordance with the WTB/
RUTG, University of Dundee in compliance with UK Home Office Animals
(Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 guidelines.
Cell culture. Cells were cultured in RPMI media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2
mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen), 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS; Labtech
International), 50 µM β-Mercaptoethanol (Sigma) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
(Invitrogen/Biosciences). For western blot analysis in amino acid-deficient media,
RPMI media without the amino acids L-glutamine and L-leucine (MP Bio) were
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated, dialysed FCS (Labtech International), 1%
penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen/Biosciences) and 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol.
For the amino acid-deficient stimulation, either 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen),
0.38 mM L-leucine (Sigma) or both amino acids together with rapamycin (20 nM,
Fisher) was added to the media. For ex vivo NK cell experiments, splenocytes were
isolated from murine spleens and left unstimulated with low-dose IL-15 (5 ng/ml)
as a survival factor or were activated with IL-2 (20 ng/ml, NCI preclinical repo-
sitory) and IL-12 (10 ng/ml, Miltenyi Biotech) for 18 h. For NK cell culture,
splenocytes were isolated from the murine spleen and cultured in IL-15 (10 ng/ml,
Peprotech; in RPMI media) for 4 days. On day 4, the cells were supplemented with
IL-15 (10 ng/ml) and cultured for a further 2 days. On day 6, cells were stimulated
for 18 h with IL-2 (20 ng/ml) and IL-12 (10 ng/ml) or were stimulated for 20 h with
IL-2 (20 ng/ml) and IL-12 (10 ng/ml) and were cultured for further 20 h in media
containing IL-2 (20 ng/ml) and IL-12 (10 ng/ml) where indicated. For AKT
experiments, NK cells were stimulated with IL-2 and IL-12 for 18 h in the presence
or absence of Akti-1/2 (2 μM, Sigma). For signalling analysis, 18 h IL-2/IL-12-
activated NK cells were treated with Akti-1/2 (2 µM, Sigma), the proteasomal
inhibitor MG132 (3 μM, Sigma) or the GSK3 inhibitor CT99021 (2 μM, Sigma) for
1 h or DMOG (200 µM, Sigma) for 2 h prior to protein lysis. The cells were cul-
tured in the presence or absence of glutamine (2 mM) in RPMI supplemented with
dialysed FCS, or alternatively in glutamine containing media plus the inhibitor
DON (2 μM Sigma) or the glutaminase inhibitor BPTES (10 μM). Unstimulated
cells were maintained in low-dose IL-15 (5 ng/ml) as a survival factor. For SLC7A5
inhibition experiments, the concentration of amino acids in RPMI was diluted
twofold using Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS; Invitrogen) in the presence or
absence of BCH (25 mM Sigma). For biochemical analyses, NK cells were purified
by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) using the NK cell isolation kit II
(Miltenyi Biotech) from the culture after day 6 or directly ex vivo. Where indicated,
splenocytes isolated from cMyc−/− (cMycflox/flox × Tamox-cre) or WT (cMycWT/
WT × Tamox-cre) mice were cultured for 4 days in IL-15 (10 ng/ml, Peprotech; in
RPMI media) in the presence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (0.6 µM, Sigma) to induce cre
recombinase-mediated excision of the floxed cMyc exon. The 4-hydroxytamoxifen
(0.6 µM, Sigma) was re-added on day 4 when cultures were fed with IL-15 (10 ng/
ml, Peprotech). For T-cell culture splenocytes were isolated from murine spleen
and T cells were activated with anti-CD3 antibody (2c11, 500 ng/ml) and IL-2 (20
ng/ml, NCI preclinical repository) in RPMI media for 36 h at 10 × 106 cells/ml.
Following activation, cells were washed and maintained in IL-2 (20 ng/ml). IL-2
(20 ng/ml) was re-added for the entire culture volume and the cell concentration
adjusted to 0.3 × 106 cells/ml every 24 h for a further 3 days before being put in the
presence or absence of glutamine (2 mM) in RPMI supplemented with dialysed
FCS, or alternatively in glutamine containing media plus DON (2 μM) for a further
3 days. For proliferation analysis of CD4+ T cells, T cells isolated from the murine
spleen were stained with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE; BD Bios-
ciences) before being activated with anti-CD3 antibody (2C11, 1 μg/ml, BD Bios-
ciences) in RPMI media in the presence or absence of 10 μM BPTES, or maintained
in IL-7 (10 μg/ml) for 36 h at 10 × 106 cells/ml. After activation, cells were washed
out of media and maintained in RPMI with IL-2 (20 ng/ml) for additional 48 h in
the presence or absence of DON (2 μM) inhibitor. Proliferation was assessed by cell
counts after 48 h. No significant differences in cell survival were observed as
determined by flow cytometry analysis. For analysis of cytotoxicity, YAC-1 cells
(mouse lymphoma cell line) and K562 cells (human chronic myelogenous leu-
kaemia cell line) were cultured in either RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen/Biosciences) or
Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (Sigma), both supplemented with 2 mM L-
glutamine (Invitrogen, Biosciences), 10% heat-inactivated FCS (Labtech, Interna-
tional) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen/Biosciences). YAC-1 and K562
cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection.
Flow cytometry. Cells were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C with Fc blocking antibody
CD16/CD32 (2.4G2) and subsequently stained for 20 min at 4 °C with saturating
concentrations of fluorphore conjugated antibodies. Antibodies used were as fol-

 were identified as NK1.1+, NKp46+ and CD3− cells and CD4+ T cells were
identified as CD19−, NKp46−, TCRβ+ and CD4+. For intracellular staining the
cells were incubated for 4 h with the protein transport inhibitor GolgiPlugTM (BD
Biosciences). For fixation and permeabilization of the cells, the Cytofix/Cytoperm
kit from BD Biosciences was used according to manufacturer’s instructions. Data
were acquired on either a FACSCanto, a LSR Fortessa, or a FACSCalibur (Becton
Dickinson) and analysed using FlowJo software (TreeStar). The gating strategies
used are outlined in Supplementary Figure 8. For proliferation studies, splenocytes
were stained with CFSE (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. T cells were either maintained in IL-7 (10 μg/ml) or activated with
anti-CD3 antibody (2C11, 1 μg/ml, BD Biosciences) in the presence or absence of
10 μM BPTES and were analysed on day 2 and day 3 by dilution of the dye CFSE.
To determine cMyc expression CD45.1 WT splenocytes were mixed with CD45.2
GFP-Myc splenocytes in a 1:1 ratio prior to culture as described. The ratio of
fluorescence in CD45.2 GFP-Myc and CD45.1 WT NK or T cells was calculated,
the WT cells providing a internal control for autofluorescence.
NK cell cytotoxicity. For the measurement of NK cell cytotoxicity, IL-2 (20 ng/ml)
and IL-12 (10 ng/ml) activated NK cells were stimulated for 18 h in RPMI medium
containing dialysed FCS with IL-2 (20 ng/ml) plus IL-12 (10 ng/ml) with or
without glutamine (2 mM) or the inhibitors DON (2 μM) or BPTES (10 μM). YAC-
1 or K652 target cells were stained with 20 μM calcein-AM (BD Pharmingen) at 37
°C for 30 min. 3 × 104 stained target cells were added to a 96-well V-bottomed
plate, and NK cells were added in a NK cell/target cell ratio of 5:1, 2:1 or 1:1. For
measurement of spontaneous release and maximal release, only target cells were
added to the well or a final concentration of 0.2% Triton X-100 lysis buffer was
added to target cells, respectively. Cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. After
incubation, the plate was spun down at 200 × g for 5 min, and 75 μl supernatant
was transferred to a black 96-well plate. Fluorescence was measured on a Molecular
Probes Spectra Max M3 spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 495 nm and
an emission wavelength of 515 nm. All samples were measured in triplicate, and
the average was used for further analysis.
Stable isotope tracer analysis. For analysis of TCA cycle intermediates, 4 × 106 to
5 × 106 purified cultured NK cells were stimulated for 18 h in medium containing 2
mM unlabelled glutamine. For time course experiments, purified cultured NK cells
were stimulated for 16 h in medium containing 2 mM unlabelled glutamine and IL-
2 (20 ng/ml) plus IL-12 (10 ng/ml). The cells were washed three times in medium
without glutamine, then 4 × 106 to 5 × 106 NK cells were cultured for another 30
min to 8 h in medium containing IL-2 (20 ng/ml) plus IL-12 (10 ng/ml) and 2 mM
13C5-glutamine (purity 99.1%, CK Isotopes Limited). For all experiments, cells were
harvested and washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
TCA cycle intermediates were extracted from the cell pellet and cell culture
supernatant by adding 80% aqueous methanol. Extracts were dried using a cen-
trifugal evaporator (GeneVac EZ-2, SP Scientific) and were stored at −80 °C until
further processing. Cell pellets from the experiment with unlabelled glucose were
spiked with 10 μl internal standard solution containing [U-13C] fumarate, [U-13C]
succinate, malate-d3 and citrate-d4 at 1 mM each. Calibration curves for each
analyte with the corresponding stable isotope labelled analogue as internal standard
were used to obtain quantitative data.
GC-MS analysis. To analyse intracellular TCA cycle intermediates, the cell lysates
were dried (CombiDancer Hettich AG) and subjected to methoximation and
silylation employing the derivatization protocol and instrumental setup previously
described55. Then, 1 μl of the derivatized sample was injected using splitless
injection mode. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) data were
analysed using the software Mass Hunter (version B.07.01/Build 7.1.524.0). All raw
data were corrected for natural abundance and tracer impurity using the software
IsoCor (Software Version 1.0)56 for the GC-MS data. For comparison of the label
incorporation of several metabolites, the mean isotopic enrichment is presented.
Proteomics analysis. For proteomic analysis, 5 × 106 purified cultured NK cells
were stimulated for 18 h in RPMI media containing IL-2 (20 ng/ml) plus IL-12 (10
ng/ml). To remove dead cells, a density gradient (Lymphoprep, Axis-Shield) was
used. Cells were spun down and stored at −80 °C until further preparation. Cell
pellets were lysed in 400 μl lysis buffer (4% SDS, 50 mM TEAB pH 8.5, 10 mM
TCEP). Lysates were boiled and sonicated with a BioRuptor (30 cycles: 30 s on, 30 s
off) before alkylation with iodoacetamide for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.
The lysates were subjected to the SP3 procedure for protein clean-up47 before
elution into digest buffer (0.1% SDS, 50 mM TEAB pH 8.5, 1 mM CaCl2) and
digested with LysC and Trypsin, each in a 1:50 (enzyme:protein) ratio. Tandem
mass tag (TMT) labelling and peptide clean-up were performed according to the
SP3 protocol. Samples were eluted into 2% dimethyl sulphoxide in water, combined
and dried in vacuo. The TMT samples were fractionated using off-line high pH
reverse phase chromatography: samples were loaded onto a 4.6 × 250 mm Xbrid-
geTM BEH130 C18 column with 3.5 µm particles (Waters). Using a Dionex BioRS
system, the samples were separated using a 25 min multistep gradient of solvents A
(10 mM formate at pH 9 in 2% acetonitrile) and B (10 mM ammonium formate pH
9 in 80% acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Peptides were separated into 48
fractions which were consolidated into 24 fractions. The fractions were subse-
quently dried and the peptides redissolved in 5% formic acid and analysed by liquid
chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS).
Liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. 1 μg per
fraction was analysed using an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer
(Thermo Scientific) equipped with a Dionex ultra high-pressure liquid chroma-
tography system (nano RSLC). Reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC)
was performed using a Dionex RSLC nano HPLC (Thermo Scientific). Peptides
were injected onto a 75 μm × 2 cm PepMap-C18 pre-column and resolved on a 75
μm × 50 cm RP-C18 EASY-Spray temperature-controlled integrated column-
emitter (Thermo) using a 4 h multistep gradient from 5% B to 35% B with a
constant flow of 200 nl/min. The mobile phases were: 2% acetonitrile (ACN)
incorporating 0.1% formic acid (FA; Solvent A) and 80% ACN incorporating 0.1%
FA (Solvent B). The spray was initiated by applying 2.5 kV to the EASY-Spray
emitter and the data were acquired under the control of Xcalibur software in a
data-dependent mode using top speed and 4 s duration per cycle, and the survey
scan is acquired in the Orbitrap covering the m/z range from 400 to 1400 Th with a
mass resolution of 120,000 and an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 2.0−e5
ions. The most intense ions were selected for fragmentation using collision-induced
dissociation (CID) in the ion trap with 30% CID collision energy and an isolation
window of 1.6 Th. The AGC target was set to 1.0−e4 with a maximum injection
time of 70 ms and a dynamic exclusion of 80 s. During the MS3 analysis for more
accurate TMT quantifications, 10 fragment ions were co-isolated using synchro-
nous precursor selection using a window of 2 Th and further fragmented using
HCD collision energy of 55%. The fragments were then analysed in the Orbitrap
with a resolution of 60,000. The AGC target was set to 1.0−e5 and the maximum
injection time was set to 300 ms.
Database searching and reporter ion quantification. The data were processed,
searched and quantified with the MaxQuant software package, version 1.5.7.4.
Proteins and peptides were identified using the UniProt mouse reference proteome
database (SwissProt and Trembl accessed on 13.01.2017) and the contaminants
database integrated in MaxQuant using the Andromeda search engine48,49 with the
following search parameters: carbamidomethylation of cysteine and TMT mod-
ification on peptide N-termini and lysine side chains were fixed modifications,
while methionine oxidation, acetylation of N-termini of proteins, conversion of
glutamine to pyro-glutamate and phosphorylation on STY were variable mod-
ifications. The false discovery rate was set to 5% for positive identification of
proteins and peptides with the help of the reversed mouse Uniprot database in a
decoy approach. Copy numbers were calculated as previously described50 after
allocating the summed MS1 intensities to the different experimental conditions
according to their fractional MS3 reporter intensities.
Quantitative real-time PCR. Cultured NK cells were purified using MACS pur-
ification with the NK isolation kit II (Miltenyi Biotech) prior to stimulation. RNA
was isolated using the RNeasy RNA purification mini kit (QIAGEN) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. From purified RNA, complementary DNA (cDNA)
was synthesised using the reverse-transcriptase kit qScript cDNA synthesis kit
(Quanta Biosciences). Real-time PCR was performed in triplicate in a 96-well plate
using iQ SYBR Green-based detection on an ABI 7900HT fast qPCR machine. For
the analysis of mRNA levels the derived values were normalised to Rplp0 mRNA
levels. Primer sequences are provided in Supplementary Table 1.
Seahorse metabolic flux analyser. For real-time analysis of the extracellular
acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of purified and
expanded NK cells cultured under various conditions, a Seahorse XF-24 Analyser, a
Seahorse XFe-96 Analyser or a Seahorse XF-8 Analyser (Seahorse Bioscience) was
used. In brief, 500,000 to 750,000 MACS purified, expanded NK cells were added to
a 24-well XF Cell Culture Microplate, 100,000 to 200,000 MACS purified NK cells
to a 96-well XFe Cell Culture Microplate and 200,000 ex vivo pure NK cells to an 8-
well XF Cell Culture Microplate (Seahorse Biosciences). All cell culture plates were
treated with Cell-Tak™ (BD Pharmingen) to ensure that the NK cells adhere to the
plate. Sequential measurements of ECAR and OCR following addition of the
inhibitors (Sigma) oligomycin (2 μM), FCCP (1 μM), rotenone (100 nM) plus
antimycin A (4 μM), and 2-deoxyglucose (2DG, 30 mM) allowed for the calculation
of basal glycolysis, glycolytic capacity, basal mitochondrial respiration, and max-
imal mitochondrial respiration. Where indicated, BMS303141 (10 μM, Sigma),
SB204990 (30 μM, Tocris), BPTES (10 μM,Tocris) or an equivalent amount of
vehicle control was injected into the Seahorse plate.
Western blot analysis. For western blot analysis, cells were harvested, washed
twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed at 1 × 107/ml in lysis buffer containing 50 mM
Tris Cl pH 6.7, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Bromphenol Blue, 1 µM dithiothreitol,
phosphatase- and protease inhibitors. Samples were denatured at 95 °C for 10 min,
separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Antibodies used for probing
blots are outlined in Supplementary Table 2. Uncropped western blot images are
included in Supplementary Fig. 9.

 Amino acid uptake measurements. For analysis of amino acid uptake, 1 × 106 NK
cells were resuspended in 0.4 ml uptake medium. HBSS (Gibco) containing [3H]L-
phenylalanine (1 μCi/ml) and [14C]L-glutamine (0.2 μCi/ml) was used for the
analysis of phenylalanine and glutamine uptake. The uptake assay was done in the
presence or absence of 10 mM BCH to inhibit System L–specific activity. Uptake
was assayed for 3 min with samples layered over 0.5 ml of a mixture of silicone oil
(Dow Corning 550 (BDH silicone products); specific density, 1.07 g/ml) and
dibutyl phthalate (Fluka) in a ratio of 1:1. Cells were pelleted below the oil, then the
aqueous supernatant solution, followed by the silicon oil–dibutyl phthalate mix-
ture, was aspirated, and the cell pellet underneath was resuspended in 200 μl NaOH
(0.5 M). Then, β-radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting in a
Beckman LS 6500 Multi-Purpose Scintillation Counter (Beckman Coulter).
Statistical analysis. GraphPad Prism 6.00 (GraphPad Software) was used for
statistical analysis. A one-way or a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the
Tukey or Sidak post hoc test was used for multiple comparisons. Student's t-test
was used when there were only two data sets for comparison. For comparison of
relative values, a one-sample t-test was used to calculate p values with the theo-
retical mean set to 1.00. A p-value of <0.05 was considered as statistically
significant.
