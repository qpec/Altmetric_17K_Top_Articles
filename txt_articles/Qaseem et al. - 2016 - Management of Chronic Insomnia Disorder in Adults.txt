Description: The American College of Physicians (ACP) devel-
oped this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical
recommendations on the management of chronic insomnia dis-
order in adults.
Methods: This guideline is based on a systematic review of ran-
domized, controlled trials published in English from 2004
through
September
2015.
Evaluated
outcomes
included
global outcomes assessed by questionnaires, patient-reported
sleep outcomes, and harms. The target audience for this guide-
line includes all clinicians, and the target patient population in-
cludes adults with chronic insomnia disorder. This guideline
grades the evidence and recommendations by using the ACP
grading system, which is based on the GRADE (Grading of Rec-
ommendations
Assessment,
Development
and
Evaluation)
approach.
Recommendation 1: ACP recommends that all adult patients
receive cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as the
initial treatment for chronic insomnia disorder. (Grade: strong rec-
ommendation, moderate-quality evidence)
Recommendation 2: ACP recommends that clinicians use a
shared decision-making approach, including a discussion of the
benefits, harms, and costs of short-term use of medications, to
decide whether to add pharmacological therapy in adults with
chronic insomnia disorder in whom cognitive behavioral therapy
for insomnia (CBT-I) alone was unsuccessful. (Grade: weak rec-
ommendation, low-quality evidence)

I
nsomnia is a major health care problem in the United
States. It is defined as dissatisfaction with sleep quan-
tity or quality and is associated with difficulty initiating
or maintaining sleep and early-morning waking with in-
ability to return to sleep (1). Approximately 6% to 10%
of adults have insomnia that meets diagnostic criteria
(1–4). Insomnia is more common in women and older
adults (5, 6) and can occur independently or be caused
by another disease. People with the disorder often ex-
perience fatigue, poor cognitive function, mood distur-
bance, and distress or interference with personal func-
tioning (2, 4). An estimated $30 billion to $107 billion is
spent on insomnia in the United States each year (7).
Insomnia also takes a toll on the economy in terms of
loss of workplace productivity, estimated at $63.2 bil-
lion in the United States in 2009 (8).
Chronic insomnia, also referred to as “chronic in-
somnia disorder” in the American Psychiatric Associa-
tion's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor-
ders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), is diagnosed according to
the DSM-5 (9) and the International Classification of
Sleep Disorders (10), which have similar criteria for
making the diagnosis. These criteria specify that symp-
toms must cause clinically significant functional distress
or impairment; be present for at least 3 nights per week
for at least 3 months; and not be linked to other sleep,
medical, or mental disorders (1). Symptoms of insom-
nia differ between older adults and the younger popu-
lation. Older adults are more likely to report problems
with waking after sleep onset (difficulty maintaining
sleep) than they are to report problems with sleep on-
set latency (time to fall asleep).
The goal of treatment for insomnia is to improve
sleep and alleviate distress or dysfunction caused by
the disorder. Insomnia can be managed with psycho-
logical therapy, pharmacologic therapy, or a combina-
tion of both. Psychological therapy options include
cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I); mul-
ticomponent behavioral therapy or brief behavioral
therapy (BBT) for insomnia; and other interventions,
such as stimulus control, relaxation strategies, and
sleep restriction (see Appendix Table 1, available at

tions). Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is
multimodal cognitive behavioral therapy targeted spe-
cifically to insomnia. It consists of a combination of cog-
nitive therapy, behavioral interventions (such as sleep
restriction and stimulus control), and educational inter-
ventions (such as sleep hygiene). Various delivery
methods are available, including in-person individual
or group therapy, telephone- or Web-based modules,
and self-help books. Trained clinicians or mental health
professionals can administer CBT-I.
Pharmacologic therapy in the United States in-
cludes drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Ad-
ministration (FDA) for insomnia treatment, including
benzodiazepines (triazolam, estazolam, temazepam,
flurazepam, and quazepam); nonbenzodiazepine hyp-
notics (zaleplon, zolpidem, and eszopiclone); the re-
cently approved orexin receptor antagonist suvorexant;
the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon; the antide-
pressant doxepin; off-label use of drugs, such as other
antidepressants,
antihistamines,
and
antipsychotics;
and melatonin.
Complementary and alternative approaches, in-
cluding acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine,
have also been used to treat insomnia.
GUIDELINE FOCUS AND TARGET POPULATION
The purpose of this American College of Physicians
(ACP) guideline is to present recommendations based
on the evidence on the efficacy, comparative effective-
ness, and safety of treatments for chronic insomnia dis-
order. The target audience for this guideline includes
all clinicians, and the target patient population includes
all adults with chronic insomnia disorder. These recom-
mendations are based on 2 background evidence re-
view papers (11, 12) and an evidence review sponsored
by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
(AHRQ) (13).
METHODS
Systematic Review of the Evidence
The
evidence
review
was
conducted
by
the
AHRQ's Minnesota Evidence-based Practice Center.
The summary of methods for the evidence review is
provided in the Appendix (available at www.annals
.org), and additional details are included in the accom-
panying background evidence review papers (11, 12)
and the full evidence report (13). Reviewers searched
several databases for randomized, controlled trials
(RCTs) published in English from 2004 through Sep-
tember 2015. The study population included adults
(aged ≥18 years) with chronic insomnia disorder (in-
somnia definitions that match diagnostic criteria for in-
somnia disorder).
The systematic evidence review evaluated psycho-
logical therapies, including CBT-I, multicomponent be-
havioral therapy or BBT for insomnia, stimulus control,
relaxation strategies, and sleep restriction; pharmaco-
logic therapies, including doxepin, triazolam, estazo-
lam, temazepam, flurazepam, quazepam, zaleplon, zol-
pidem, eszopiclone, ramelteon, suvorexant, off-label
use of drugs (such as antidepressants and antipsychot-
ics), and melatonin; and complementary and alterna-
tive approaches, including acupuncture and Chinese
herbal medicine. Evaluated outcomes included global
outcomes assessed by questionnaires (such as treat-
ment response), patient-reported and intermediate
sleep outcomes, and harms.
Grading the Evidence and Developing
Recommendations
This guideline was developed by the ACP Clinical
Guidelines Committee according to the ACP guideline
development process, details of which can be found in
the ACP methods paper (14). The Clinical Guidelines
Committee used the evidence tables in the accompa-
nying systematic review and full report (11, 12) when
reporting the evidence and graded the recommenda-
tions by using the ACP system, which is based on the
GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
Development and Evaluation) approach (Table).
Peer Review
The AHRQ evidence review was sent to invited
peer reviewers and posted on the AHRQ Web site for
public comments. The guideline was peer reviewed
through the journal and was posted online for com-
ments from ACP Regents and Governors, who repre-
sent physician members at the national level.
BENEFITS OF TREATMENTS FOR CHRONIC
INSOMNIA DISORDER
The efficacy, safety, and comparative effectiveness
of psychological and pharmacologic treatments for
chronic insomnia disorder are summarized in Appendix
Tables 2 to 5 (available at www.annals.org) and in the
accompanying evidence reviews (11, 12). Evidence is
described for the general adult population as well as
for older adults (aged >55 years).
Psychological Treatment
Evidence for most psychological therapies was lim-
ited, and there was insufficient evidence to determine
the comparative effectiveness of different psychologi-
cal treatments for chronic insomnia disorder in the gen-
eral population or in older adults.

 General Population
Moderate-quality evidence showed that CBT-I im-
proved remission, treatment response, sleep onset la-
tency, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, and
sleep quality in the general population (15–34). Im-
provements were seen across the various methods of
CBT-I delivery, including in-person individual therapy
(18, 24, 33, 35, 36), in-person group therapy (19, 20,
31), telephone-based modules (21), Web-based mod-
ules (17, 22, 23, 25), and self-help books (26, 29, 37);
however, evidence was insufficient to determine the su-
periority of one method over another.
Low-quality evidence showed that stimulus control
improved sleep onset latency and total sleep time in
the general population (38, 39).
Older Population
For
older
adults,
moderate-quality
evidence
showed that CBT-I improved Insomnia Severity Index
(ISI) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores
compared with controls, and low- to moderate-quality
evidence showed that CBT-I improved sleep onset la-
tency, wake after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency
(40–46).
Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that
multicomponent behavioral therapy or BBT improved
sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, sleep effi-
ciency, and sleep quality in older adults (47–50). Low-
quality evidence showed that stimulus control im-
proved total sleep time in older adults (51, 52).
Pharmacologic Treatment
Evidence was insufficient to determine the benefits
of pharmacologic therapy with benzodiazepines in the
general population or in older adults. Few trials met the
inclusion criteria for the evidence review, largely be-
cause many assessed short durations of treatment.
General Population
Low-quality evidence showed that eszopiclone im-
proved remission, and low- to moderate-quality evi-
dence showed that it improved sleep onset latency, to-
tal sleep time, and wake after sleep onset compared
with placebo in the general population (53–55). Zale-
plon did not improve total sleep time in the general
population (low-quality evidence) (56, 57). Moderate-
quality evidence showed that zolpidem improved sleep
onset latency and total sleep time in the general pop-
ulation (56–61). Zolpidem taken “as needed” improved
Clinical Global Impression scores (62) (low-quality evi-
dence), sleep onset latency, and total sleep time
(moderate-quality evidence) in the general population
(62–64). Zolpidem extended-release improved Clinical
Global Impression scores, sleep onset latency, total
sleep time, and wake after sleep onset in the general
population (low-quality evidence) (65). Low-quality evi-
dence showed that sublingual zolpidem reduced sleep
onset latency after middle-of-the-night waking (66).
Moderate-quality evidence showed that suvorexant in-
creased treatment response and improved sleep onset
latency, total sleep time, and wake after sleep onset
compared with placebo in mixed general populations
(67). Doxepin improved total sleep time and wake after
sleep onset in the general population (low-quality evi-
dence) (68).
Older Population
In older adults, low-quality evidence showed that
eszopiclone improved remission, total sleep time, and
wake after sleep onset (69). Low-quality evidence
showed that zolpidem reduced sleep onset latency in
older adults (70). Suvorexant increased treatment re-
sponse and improved sleep onset latency, total sleep
time, and wake after sleep onset compared with pla-
cebo in mixed older populations (moderate-quality ev-
idence) (67). Low-quality evidence showed that ramelt-
eon reduced sleep onset latency in older adults (71).
Doxepin improved mean ISI scores, sleep onset la-
tency, total sleep time, and wake after sleep onset in
older adults (low- to moderate-quality evidence) (72,
73).
Complementary and Alternative Treatments
There was insufficient evidence to determine the
safety or efficacy of complementary and alternative
treatments for insomnia disorder in the general popu-
lation or in older adults (13).
COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT
TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS
Overall, evidence was insufficient to determine the
comparative efficacy of pharmacologic treatments for
insomnia disorder in the general population or in older
adults.
HARMS OF TREATMENTS FOR CHRONIC
INSOMNIA DISORDER
A full summary of the evidence supporting the
harms of treatments for chronic insomnia disorder is
provided in Appendix Tables 2 to 5 and the accompa-
nying evidence reviews (11, 12).
Psychological Treatment
Specific adverse effects were not reported for psy-
chological interventions, and withdrawals were not re-
ported for treatment versus control groups. Therefore,
evidence was insufficient to determine the harms of
psychological interventions. However, due to the non-
invasive nature of CBT-I, adverse effects are likely to be
mild.
Pharmacologic Treatment
Harms were insufficiently reported in many of the
included RCTs, which most often provided data only on
study withdrawals. In addition to evidence from the sys-
tematic review on study withdrawals and adverse ef-
fects, specific adverse effects associated with the vari-
ous pharmacologic treatments are summarized in
Appendix Tables 4 and 5.

 Data from observational studies suggest that seri-
ous adverse effects, such as dementia and fractures,
may be associated with hypnotic drugs (74, 75). Prod-
uct labels from the FDA warn patients about cognitive
and behavioral changes, such as possible driving im-
pairment and motor vehicle accidents, as well as other
adverse effects. The FDA also recommends lower
doses of benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hyp-
notics in women and in older or debilitated adults. In
addition, the FDA recommends short-term use of these
drugs, although many patients may continue their use
for extended periods.
Comparative Safety of Pharmacologic
Treatments
Evidence was generally insufficient to determine
the
comparative
safety
of
various
pharmacologic
treatments.
The Figure summarizes the recommendations and
clinical considerations.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendation 1: ACP recommends that all adult
patients receive cognitive behavioral therapy for insom-
nia (CBT-I) as the initial treatment for chronic insomnia
disorder. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-
quality evidence)
Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia consists
of a combination of treatments that include cognitive
therapy around sleep, behavioral interventions (such as
sleep restriction and stimulus control), and education
(such as sleep hygiene). It can be performed in primary
care (18, 19). There are various delivery methods for
CBT-I, such as individual or group therapy, telephone-
or Web-based modules, or self-help books. Most stud-
ies focused on in-person CBT-I; however, the data sug-
gest that other delivery methods are also effective.
Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia should
be
considered
first-line
treatment
for
adults
with
chronic insomnia disorder. Although the current evi-
dence is insufficient to show the harms associated with
behavioral interventions, any such harms are likely to
be mild. Moderate-quality evidence showed that CBT-I
improved global outcomes in the general population,
including increased remission and treatment response
and reduced ISI and PSQI scores compared with con-
trols. Moderate-quality evidence showed that CBT-I
also improved sleep outcomes in the general popula-
tion, including reduced sleep onset latency and wake
after sleep onset and improved sleep efficiency and
sleep
quality.
Low-
to
moderate-quality
evidence
showed that CBT-I also improved global and sleep out-
comes in older adults, including improved PSQI and ISI
scores, reduced sleep onset latency, and improved
sleep efficiency. Moderate-quality evidence showed
that CBT-I reduced wake after sleep onset in older
adults.
Recommendation 2: ACP recommends that clini-
cians use a shared decision-making approach, including
a discussion of the benefits, harms, and costs of short-
term use of medications, to decide whether to add
pharmacological therapy in adults with chronic insom-
nia disorder in whom cognitive behavioral therapy for
insomnia (CBT-I) alone was unsuccessful. (Grade: weak
recommendation, low-quality evidence)
Benefits of pharmacologic treatment include im-
proved sleep outcomes, such as sleep onset latency
and total sleep time, and in some cases improved
global outcomes in the general population and in older
adults. Most studies have examined newer medica-
tions, whereas commonly used older and generic med-
ications, such as diphenhydramine and trazodone,
have not been studied. Low-quality evidence showed
that both eszopiclone and zolpidem improved global
outcomes in the general population, and low- to
moderate-quality evidence showed that eszopiclone,
zolpidem, and doxepin improved sleep outcomes,
such as sleep onset latency, total sleep time, and wake
after sleep onset. Moderate-quality evidence showed
that suvorexant, an orexin antagonist recently ap-
proved by the FDA, improved treatment response and
sleep outcomes in mixed general and adult popula-
tions. Low-quality evidence showed no statistically sig-
nificant difference between ramelteon and placebo for
sleep outcomes in the general population.
In older adults, low-quality evidence showed that
eszopiclone improved global and sleep outcomes and
both zolpidem and ramelteon decreased sleep onset
latency. Moderate-quality evidence showed that dox-
epin improved ISI scores, and low- to moderate-quality
evidence showed that it improved sleep outcomes.
Evidence was insufficient for melatonin in the gen-
eral population and in older adults. Benzodiazepines,
although widely used, were not addressed in this
guideline because few studies met the inclusion criteria
of the systematic review (insufficient evidence).
Evidence on harms was limited from RCTs that met
the inclusion criteria for the review, which mostly re-
ported on study withdrawals. However, observational
studies have shown that hypnotic drugs may be associ-
ated with infrequent but serious adverse effects, such
as dementia, serious injury, and fractures (74, 75, 76,
77). In addition, FDA labels warn of daytime impair-
ment, “sleep driving,” behavioral abnormalities, and
worsening depression. The FDA suggests dosages
lower than those used in many of the included studies,
especially for older adults.
Evidence is insufficient to evaluate the balance of
the benefits and harms of long-term use of pharmaco-
logic treatments in adults with chronic insomnia disor-
der. The FDA has approved pharmacologic therapy for
short-term use (4 to 5 weeks), and patients should not
continue using the drugs for extended periods. The
FDA also recommends that patients with insomnia that
does not remit within 7 to 10 days of treatment should
be further evaluated.
There was insufficient evidence overall on the com-
parative effectiveness and safety of the various pharma-
cologic treatments. See Appendix Tables 4 and 5 for a
summary of efficacy, adverse events, and costs for

AREAS WITH INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE
For nonpharmacologic therapy, evidence was in-
sufficient to determine the effect of multicomponent
behavioral interventions or BBT, sleep restriction, stim-
ulus control, or relaxation therapy on global outcomes
in the general population or in older adults with chronic
insomnia disorder. There was also insufficient evidence
to determine the effect of sleep restriction or relaxation
therapy on sleep outcomes in these populations.
Figure—Continued
Harms 
Psychological: sparsely reported but likely small because of noninvasive nature of therapy
Pharmacologic: sparsely reported overall from the included RCTs
   Benzodiazepines
      Daytime drowsiness, dizziness or lightheadedness, dementia
      Increased risk for falls, hip fractures, and mobility problems in older adults
      Temazepam associated with an increase in incident cancer cases
   Nonbenzodiazepines
      Eszopiclone: somnolence, unpleasant taste, myalgia, memory impairment, psychiatric-related adverse effects, depression,
      anxiety, accidental injury
      Zaleplon: pain, somnolence or dizziness, gastrointestinal events, arrhythmia, hallucinations
      Zolpidem: anxiety, somnolence, mood alterations, hallucinations, depression, psychiatric-related adverse events, memory
      and driving impairment, risk for fractures or major head injury or fracture requiring hospitalization, increase in incident
      cancer cases
      Suvorexant: somnolence; cognitive and behavioral changes, such as amnesia, anxiety, hallucinations, and other 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms; complex behaviors, such as “sleep-driving”; worsening of depression, including suicidal
      thinking in persons with depression; daytime impairments; sleep paralysis; hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations
      Ramelteon: dizziness; somnolence (similar to placebo); fatigue; headache; unpleasant taste; nausea; new cognitive or 
      behavioral abnormalities; complex behaviors, such as “sleep-driving”; exacerbation of depression and suicidal ideation in
      primarily depressed patients
      Doxepin: sedation, fatigue, weakness, lethargy, dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, headache
      Infrequent but serious adverse events, such as fractures and dementia, have been reported for hypnotic drugs in 
      observational studies. FDA label warnings include daytime impairment, “sleep driving,” behavioral abnormalities, and
      worsening depression in depressed patients.
Complementary and alternative treatments: none reported
Recommendations
Recommendation 1: ACP recommends that all adult patients receive cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as the
  initial treatment for chronic insomnia disorder. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)
Recommendation 2: ACP recommends that clinicians use a shared decision-making approach, including a discussion of the
  benefits, harms, and costs of short-term use of medications, to decide whether to add pharmacological therapy in adults with
  chronic insomnia disorder in whom cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) alone was unsuccessful. (Grade: weak 
  recommendation, low-quality evidence)
Clinical Considerations
Medications should ideally be used for no longer than 4 to 5 wk, and the skills learned in CBT-I can manage insomnia over the 
  longer term.
Studies of chronic insomnia disorder typically excluded patients with insomnia due to another disorder. Before recommending
  that patients continue use of insomnia medications, clinicians should consider treatable secondary causes of insomnia, such as 
  depression; pain; benign prostatic hypertrophy; substance abuse disorders; and other sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea and
  restless legs syndrome.
If, after a trial of CBT-I, a shared decision is made to continue medications for longer than 4 to 5 wk, clinicians should revisit the
  need for medication continuation at periodic intervals.
Chronic insomnia disorder itself may have deleterious health effects. However, whether medications decrease the harmful health
  effects of sleep deprivation is unknown, and evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms from long-term
  use of medications.
Older adults more frequently report WASO than SOL.
Older adults can be more sensitive to medications and their adverse effects and should be monitored closely when treated with 
  pharmacologic agents.
BBT = brief behavioral therapy; CBT-I = cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia; CGI = Clinical Global Impression Scale; FDA = U.S. Food and
Drug Administration; ISI = Insomnia Severity Index; PSQI = Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; RCT = randomized, controlled trial; SOL = sleep onset
latency; TST = total sleep time; WASO = wake after sleep onset.

 For pharmacologic therapy, there was insufficient
evidence on the effectiveness of benzodiazepine hyp-
notics (temazepam, triazolam, flurazepam, or quaz-
epam), melatonin, or trazodone on global or sleep out-
comes in the general population or in older adults with
chronic insomnia disorder. Evidence was also insuffi-
cient for the effectiveness of complementary and alter-
native treatments.
There was insufficient evidence to determine the
comparative safety or efficacy of pharmacologic or psy-
chological treatments for insomnia disorder in the gen-
eral population or in older adults. Trials comparing
pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies are
lacking and would be useful. Evidence was insufficient
for pharmacologic therapy or the choice of agent to
treat patients with sleep maintenance insomnia if CBT-I
alone was unsuccessful. There was insufficient evidence
for the balance of the benefits and harms of long-term
use of pharmacologic treatments in adults with chronic
insomnia disorder.
HIGH-VALUE CARE
Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is an ef-
fective therapy for chronic insomnia disorder and can
be performed and prescribed in the primary care set-
ting. Evidence showed that CBT-I was effective in treat-
ing the general population of adults as well as older
adults with chronic insomnia disorder. There is insuffi-
cient evidence to directly compare CBT-I and pharma-
cologic treatment. However, because CBT-I is noninva-
sive,
it
is
likely
to
have
fewer
harms,
whereas
pharmacologic therapy can be associated with serious
adverse events. Thus, CBT-I provides better overall
value than pharmacologic treatment. As indicated on
FDA labeling, pharmacologic treatments for insomnia
are intended for short-term use, and patients should be
discouraged from using these drugs for extended pe-
riods. Because few studies evaluated the use of the
medications for more than 4 weeks, long-term adverse
effects are unknown.

APPENDIX: DETAILED METHODS
The evidence review was conducted by the Minne-
sota Evidence-based Practice Center to address the fol-
lowing key questions:
1. What are the efficacy and comparative effective-
ness of treatments for insomnia disorder in adults?
a. What are the efficacy and comparative effective-
ness of treatments for insomnia disorder in specific
subgroups of adults?
b. What are the efficacy and comparative effective-
ness of combined treatments (e.g., cognitive behavioral
therapy and drug therapy) for the treatment of insom-
nia disorder in adults?
c. What are the long-term efficacy and comparative
effectiveness of treatments for insomnia disorder in
adults?
2. What are the harms of treatments for insomnia
disorder in adults?
a. What are the harms of treatments for insomnia
disorder in specific subgroups of adults?
b. What are the harms of combined treatments
(e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy and drug therapy)
for insomnia disorder in adults?
c. What are the long-term harms of treatments for
insomnia disorder in adults?
Search Strategy
The systematic literature search included English-
language RCTs published from 2004 through Septem-
ber 2015 (nonpharmacologic interventions), identified
using MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Regis-
ter of Controlled Trials, and PsycINFO bibliographic da-
tabases as well as hand-searches of references of rele-
vant studies. Studies were limited to RCTs of at least 4
weeks' duration that enrolled participants with insom-
nia disorder and reported global or sleep outcomes.
Studies focused on patient-reported outcomes rather
than sleep measures obtained by actigraphy and poly-
somnography. Large observational studies on pharma-
cologic hypnotics in adults with insomnia were in-
cluded for consideration of harms data.
Quality Assessment
The quality of studies was assessed using the
Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the AHRQ handbook
(78, 79), and the quality of systematic reviews was as-
sessed using the AMSTAR (A Measurement Tool to As-
sess Systematic Reviews) criteria (80). Additional infor-
mation, including inclusion and exclusion criteria, is in
the full evidence report (13) and the accompanying ar-
ticles (11, 12). This guideline rates the evidence and
recommendations by using the ACP guideline grading
system (Table).
Population Studied
Studies were limited to adults older than 18 years
with chronic insomnia disorder (that is, insomnia defini-
tions that matched diagnostic criteria for insomnia dis-
order). “Older adults” were those older than 55 years.
Patients who use alcohol to treat their insomnia disor-
der and those who misuse or abuse alcohol were out-
side the scope of this guideline.
Interventions Evaluated
Psychological therapy included CBT-I, multicompo-
nent behavioral therapy or BBT for insomnia, stimulus
control, relaxation strategies, and sleep restriction.
Pharmacologic therapy included doxepin, triazolam,
estazolam, temazepam, flurazepam, quazepam, zale-
plon, zolpidem, eszopiclone, ramelteon, and suvorex-
ant; off-label use of drugs, such as antidepressants and
antipsychotics; and melatonin. Complementary and al-
ternative approaches included acupuncture and Chi-
nese herbal medicine.
Comparators
Psychological interventions were compared with
usual care, wait-list controls (patients who have not yet
received the intervention but are on a wait list to re-
ceive it), or other insomnia treatments. Efficacy or effec-
tiveness of pharmacologic interventions and comple-
mentary and alternative approaches were compared
with those of placebo or another agent in the same or
another drug class.

 Outcomes
The goal of insomnia treatment is meaningful im-
provement in sleep and associated distress and/or dys-
function. Outcomes evaluated included 1) global out-
comes, which measure improvements in sleep and
related daytime dysfunction or distress and were as-
sessed by the ISI and the PSQI; 2) sleep outcomes,
which can be objective or patient-reported from sleep
diaries and include sleep onset latency, wake after
sleep onset, total sleep time, the intermediate sleep
measures of sleep efficiency (total sleep time divided
by the total time in bed) and sleep quality, function,
mood, and quality of life; and 3) harms of treatment,
such as adverse effects and study withdrawals.
Target Audience
The target audience for this guideline includes all
clinicians,
patients,
health
system
leaders,
and
policymakers.
Target Patient Population
The target patient population includes all adults
with chronic insomnia disorder.
Limitations
Sample sizes were small in most of the included
RCTs, which were also of short duration. Minimally im-
portant differences were often not established or used
in the studies. A large placebo response was observed
for pharmacologic treatments.
Grading the Evidence and Developing
Recommendations
This guideline was developed by the ACP Clinical
Guidelines Committee according to the ACP guideline
development process, details of which can be found in
the ACP methods paper (14). The Clinical Guidelines
Committee used the evidence tables in the accompa-
nying systematic review and full report (11–13) when
reporting the evidence and graded the recommenda-
tions by using the ACP guideline grading system
(Table).
Peer Review
The AHRQ evidence review was sent to invited
peer reviewers and posted on the AHRQ Web site for
public comments. The guideline underwent a peer re-
view process through the journal and was posted on-
line for comments from ACP Regents and Governors,
who represent physician members at the national level.

 Appendix Table 1. Psychological Interventions for Insomnia Disorder*
Treatment
Description
Stimulus control
Behavioral treatment that aims to establish consistency in sleep patterns and maintain an association of
sleep with the bed and bedroom (e.g., only go to sleep when tired)
Sleep restriction
Behavioral intervention that limits time in bed to sleep time, gradually increasing the time spent in bed
as sleep efficiency improves
Relaxation training
Training to reduce somatic tension and control bedtime thought patterns that impair sleep
Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia
Combination treatments that include cognitive and behavioral components, including stimulus control,
sleep restriction, and sometimes relaxation training
Multicomponent therapy or brief
behavioral therapy for insomnia
Multicomponent behavioral therapies without cognitive therapy
