Abstract
This study examines the relationship between self-
reports of being high on marijuana and percep-
tions about driving high or drunk. Data were
collected in 2014 from an online convenience
sample of adult, past 30-day marijuana and hash-
ish users in Colorado and Washington (n¼ 865).
Respondents were asked, “Were you high or feel-
ing the effects of marijuana or hashish when you
took this survey?” Logistic regression was used to
assess the relationship between being high and be-
liefs about driving high, controlling for demo-
graphics and marijuana use. Respondents who
reported being high at the time of survey admin-
istration had higher odds of agreeing with the
statements, “I can safely drive under the influence
of marijuana” (OR¼ 3.13, P< 0.001) and “I can
safely drive under the influence of alcohol”
(OR¼ 3.71, P< 0.001) compared with respond-
ents who did not report being high. Respondents
who were high also had higher odds of being open
to driving high under certain circumstances. Being
high may influence perceptions about the safety of
drugged and drunk driving. The effectiveness of
public health messages to prevent drugged and
drunk driving may depend in part on how persua-
sive they are among individuals who are high.
Introduction
Over the past decade, nearly half of U.S. states have
legalized marijuana for medical or recreational
purposes, and at least 10 states are currently con-
sidering recreational marijuana ballot initiatives [1].
The long-term public health implications of legaliz-
ing marijuana for recreational use are unknown, and
may include both positive and negative outcomes.
However, one concern is that widespread legaliza-
tion of marijuana may increase incidence of drugged
driving [2]. More readily available marijuana may
also play a role in incidence of driving under the
influence of alcohol. A study based on National
Alcohol Survey data from 2005 and 2010 indicates
that 7.5% of current drinkers nationwide “usually or
sometimes” use alcohol and marijuana simultan-
eously and that simultaneous use doubles the odds
of drunk driving [3].
A robust body of evidence shows that driving
under the influence of alcohol is a cause of car
crashes [4]. The evidence related to marijuana use
and car crashes is less clear. For example, two recent
meta-analyses [5, 6] and a review of the literature [7]
indicate that use of marijuana prior to driving ap-
proximately doubles the risk of a crash. In contrast, a
recent case–control crash-risk study conducted by
the NHTSA indicates that marijuana use does not
increase the likelihood of a car crash and that crashes
occurring under the simultaneous influence of mari-
juana and alcohol are attributable solely to alcohol
[8]. Discrepant findings may stem in part from the
complexity of measuring the degree to which an
individual is impaired by marijuana at a given
moment in time [9–13].
A key question is whether legalization of mari-
juana for recreational use will change patterns of

 behavior and social norms in ways that will affect
the likelihood of driving high, the likelihood of driv-
ing under the simultaneous influence of marijuana
and alcohol and the incidence of marijuana-related
car crashes. Evidence from alcohol research clearly
shows that individuals who are intoxicated under-
estimate the likelihood of negative consequences of
risky actions [14]. Experimental studies show that
individuals who are intoxicated perceive drunk driv-
ing to be less dangerous than sober individuals [15]
and have an increased willingness to drive drunk
under certain conditions, such as “a short distance”
[16]. These studies, conducted in carefully con-
trolled settings, highlight a basic precept underlying
campaigns to prevent drugged and drunk driving:
the decision to drive or refrain from driving while
under the influence of drugs such as marijuana and
alcohol may be made in a moment of intoxication,
when assessment of risk is less likely than usual to
cohere with reality [14].
Using a survey of marijuana users in Colorado
and Washington, we examined the association be-
tween self-reported marijuana and hashish highs and
marijuana-related safety perceptions, including the
perception that drugged driving is safe and that get-
ting caught is unlikely. We also explored whether
self-reports of being high are associated with open-
ness to driving high in certain situations. Finally, we
examined the association between these risk percep-
tions
and
self-reported
levels
of
marijuana
consumption.
Methods
Study design and sample
Data are from an online survey, administered in
September 2014 to a convenience sample of past-
year marijuana or hashish users, aged 18 and older,
living in Colorado or Washington. Respondents
were recruited from the Global Market Insite
(GMI) online panel which is an established panel
of U.S. adults. The survey took �20 min to com-
plete. The study design and instrument were
approved by RTI’s federally sanctioned institutional
review board.
The total study sample consisted of 1352 respond-
ents, with 634 from Colorado and 718 from
Washington. For the purpose of this analysis, we
further limited the sample to the 865 respondents
reporting past 30-day marijuana or hashish use,
which consisted of 399 respondents from Colorado
and 466 from Washington.
Measures
Self-reported assessment of being high was mea-
sured by asking respondents, “Were you high or
feeling the effects of marijuana or hashish when
you took this survey?” Response options were
“yes,” “no,” and “don’t know/prefer not to
answer.”
Risk perception items related specifically to the
safety of driving under the influence of marijuana or
alcohol and the risk of being caught driving high.
Belief items examined respondents’ willingness to
drive high in certain contexts. We measured risk
perceptions by asking respondents whether they
agreed or disagreed with the statements, “I can
safely drive under the influence of marijuana,” “I
can safely drive under the influence of alcohol,” and
“If I drove high I would probably not get caught.”
We measured beliefs about driving high in certain
situations by asking respondents whether they
agreed or disagreed that “It is OK to drive a little
bit stoned,” “In certain situations I might drive
high,” and “I would never consider driving high.”
Response options were measured on a 5-point scale
ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree,
with an option for “neither agree nor disagree”
and a “don’t know/prefer not to answer” option.
Data were collapsed into dichotomous variables rep-
resenting agreement (including those who strongly
agreed or agreed with statements) and disagreement
(including those who strongly disagreed, disagreed,
or were neutral in regard to statements). Responses
of “don’t know/prefer not to answer” were set to
missing for this analysis.
Demographic data were collected using items
from the 2012U.S. Census Bureau. Measures of ma-
rijuana and hashish use—ever use, past year use, and
past 30-day use—are from the 2012 National Survey

 on Drug Use and Health. These measures consist of
the following questions: “Have you ever, even once,
used marijuana or hashish?” and “How long has it
been since you last used marijuana or hashish?”
Number of days used in the past month was mea-
sured by asking, “Now think about the past month,
from (DATEFILL) through today. On average, how
many days did you use marijuana or hashish during
the past month?” Respondents were able to enter a
number from 1 to 31.
Consumption was measured as follows: “Now we
are going to show you five pictures of marijuana.
Thinking about the last day you used marijuana,
how much did you personally use that entire day?
Please check the box next to the photo that best
represents how much you used.” Images showed
1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64 and 1/128 oz. of marijuana.
Hashish consumption was measured similarly,
with images showing 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16 and 1/32
g. For both items, respondents could also select the
following responses: “Less than these amounts,” “I
have not used marijuana/hashish in the past year”
or “Don’t know/prefer not to answer.” We used
ounces as the unit of marijuana measurement and
grams as the unit of hashish measurement because
these are the metrics by which they are commonly
sold. Because a gram is much smaller than an ounce
(1 g ¼ 0.035 ounces), it is better suited for the pur-
chase of hashish, which is typically purchased in
smaller quantities relative to marijuana due to its
higher THC level. Marijuana and hashish consump-
tion were combined to form an overall individual
consumption variable. For the purpose of analysis,
the sample was split into tertiles, with approximately
one-third of the sample in each consumption cat-
egory (low, medium and high).
Analysis
Analysis consisted of six logistic regression models,
each of which examined the association between
self-reports of being high at the time of survey ad-
ministration and the risk perception and belief out-
comes described above. Each model controlled for
state of residence, gender, age, education, mental
health status, number of days of marijuana or
hashish use in the past 30, and amount of marijuana
or hashish consumed in the past month. Analysis
was completed using Stata 13.1.
Results
Sample characteristics
Sample characteristics are presented in Table I. All
respondents were past 30-day marijuana or hashish
users. A substantial proportion of the sample
(16.4%) reported being high at the time of survey
administration. Females represented 60.4% of the
sample. The sample was generally older (70.2%
were aged 35 or older), largely white (79.3%) and
well educated (55.4% had a college degree or more
education). In terms of mental health status, 42.5%
reported no days in the past 30 during which their

 mental health was “not good,” and 36.7% reported
having 1–7 days during which their mental health
was not good.
Findings
Proportion of the sample that endorsed
risk perception and belief items
One-third of all respondents (33.4%) agreed or
strongly agreed with the statement “I can safely
drive under the influence of marijuana,” whereas
only 8.3% agreed or strongly agreed they could
safely drive under the influence of alcohol (data
not shown). More than one-third of respondents
(37.9%) agreed or strongly agreed that if they
drove high, they would probably not get caught.
Substantial proportions of respondents believed it
was acceptable to drive high in certain contexts,
such as “a little bit stoned” (30.5%) and “in certain
situations” (38.8%). More than half of the sample
(53.0%), however, reported that they would never
consider driving high.
Association between being high and
perceptions of risk associated with driving
high or drunk
Respondents who reported being high at the time of
survey administration were more likely to agree
with the statements, “I can safely drive under the
influence of marijuana” (OR ¼ 3.13, P < 0.001) and
“I can safely drive under the influence of alcohol”
(OR ¼ 3.71, P < 0.001) compared with respondents
who reported not being high (see Table II).
Respondents who were high were also more likely
than those who were not to agree with the statement,
“If I drove high I would probably not get caught”
(OR ¼ 1.98, P < 0.01).
The perceived safety of driving under the influ-
ence of marijuana did not differ significantly by state
of residence, age, gender, education or mental health
status (see Table II). Only high frequency of mari-
juana use (21–30 days per month compared with 1–
10 days) and heavier marijuana use (high and
medium usage tertiles compared with the low use
tertile) were associated with greater odds of
agreeing that “I can safely drive under the influence
of marijuana.” In contrast, perceptions about the
safety of driving under the influence of alcohol dif-
fered significantly by gender, education and mental
health status, as well as by frequency and heaviness
of marijuana use. Males (compared to females), in-
dividuals with a college education or more (com-
pared
with
less
education)
and
individuals
reporting poor mental health on 8 or more days
during the past month (compared with those with
no days of poor mental health) were more likely to
agree with the statement, “I can safely drive under
the influence of alcohol.” Heavy marijuana users
(high usage tertile) were also more likely to agree
that they could drive safely under the influence of
alcohol, in contrast with frequent marijuana users
(21–30 days per month) who were less likely to
agree with the statement. Males and heavy mari-
juana users were also more likely to agree with the
statement, “If I drove high I would probably not get
caught.”
Association between being high and
openness to driving high
Respondents who reported being high at the time of
survey administration were significantly more likely
than those who were not to agree with the state-
ments, “It is OK to drive a little bit stoned”
(OR ¼ 2.74, P < 0.001) and “In certain situations I
might drive high” (OR ¼ 2.17, P < 0.001) (Table
III). Respondents who were high were significantly
less likely than those who were not high to agree
with the statement, “I would never consider driving
high” (OR ¼ 0.65, P < 0.05).
Males, individuals younger than age 35, those
with poor mental health on 8 or more days during
the past month, and those who used marijuana fre-
quently (on 21–30 days during the past month) or
heavily (high and medium usage tertiles) were more
likely to agree that it is okay to drive a little stoned
(see Table III). Males and frequent users (11–20 and
21–30 days per month) were more likely to say “In
certain situations I might drive high.” Frequent ma-
rijuana users (21–30 days per month) and heavier
marijuana users (high and medium usage tertiles)

 were less likely to agree with the statement, “I
would never consider driving high.”
Discussion
This study finds that current marijuana and hashish
users who reported being high or feeling the effects
of marijuana or hashish at the time of survey admin-
istration had substantially higher odds than those
who reported not being high of believing that they
could safely drive while under the influence of ma-
rijuana or alcohol. They also had higher odds than
those who reported not being high of saying that if
they drove under the influence of marijuana they
would “probably not get caught” and that it is
okay to drive “a little bit stoned” or “in certain situ-
ations.” Those who reported taking the survey high
had lower odds than those who did not of ruling out
driving high altogether. These findings are consist-
ent with the idea that being high may influence risk
perceptions about driving under the influence of ma-
rijuana and alcohol in potentially meaningful ways.
One-third (33.4%) of the overall sample of past
30-day users—including both those who were high
and those who were not—agreed with the statement
“I can safely drive under the influence of mari-
juana,” whereas only 8.3% agreed that they could
safely drive under the influence of alcohol. The dif-
ference in perceptions may be explained in part by
the existence of prominent, ongoing public health
campaigns and messages about the dangers of
drunk driving, widespread knowledge about laws
prohibiting drunk driving, and strong social norms
against drunk driving, all of which are rooted in a
well-established body of scientific research. In con-
trast, drugged driving, and driving under the influ-
ence of marijuana specifically, has been a lesser
focus of public health campaigns and findings
from research on the effects of marijuana use on
driving are somewhat inconsistent.
The primary limitation of this study is that the data
are from a convenience sample that is not necessarily
representative of the populations of Colorado or
Washington or of the populations of past 30-day ma-
rijuana or hashish users in those states. Our findings
are not generalizable to these populations or to mari-
juana users elsewhere. A population-based study that
examined cognitions and behaviors related to mari-
juana use in the context of the legalization of recre-
ational use would represent a valuable contribution to

 the evidence in this area and would help inform
policy and public health campaigns. The study
design limits what we may conclude from the find-
ings in another important way as well. Because the
study is cross-sectional rather than a longitudinal
study or an experiment the findings do not indicate
that being high increases the risk for driving high or
drunk; only that being high is associated with risk
perceptions about the safety of driving high or
drunk. Future studies are needed to determine
whether there is a causal effect of being high on ma-
rijuana or hashish on risk perceptions about driving,
and whether these risk perceptions are, in fact, related
to driving behavior. However, these findings are con-
sistent with studies of the effects of alcohol consump-
tion on risk perceptions, which show that intoxicated
individuals underestimate the likelihood of negative
consequences of risky actions [14–16]. Specifically,
alcohol studies with experimental designs show that
individuals who are intoxicated perceive drunk driv-
ing to be less dangerous than sober individuals [15]
and have an increased willingness to drive drunk
under certain conditions, such as “a short distance”
[16]. These findings are also consistent with research
showing that simultaneous use of marijuana and al-
cohol increases the odds of drunk driving [3].
This study has several additional limitations.
First, the primary independent variable used in this
analysis is being high or feeling the effects of mari-
juana or hashish at the time of survey administration.
Data for this variable were collected through unveri-
fied self-reports, and it is possible that some re-
spondents who reported being high were not.
Second, among respondents who were high when
they took the survey, there is no way of assessing
how high they were and how this might have influ-
enced outcomes. It would be possible to better
understand this through research conducted in an
in-person setting, especially as methods of testing
for cannabinoid impairment become more precise
[11–13]. Third, we do not measure simultaneous
use of marijuana and alcohol, or whether respond-
ents were feeling the effects of alcohol when they
took the survey, so this issue warrants additional
research. Fourth, some key measures used here
have not been validated or tested for reliability, re-
flecting the nascent state of research in this topic
area.
This study has implications for public health re-
search and for the development of public health
campaigns to prevent driving under the influence
of marijuana and alcohol. Studies with stronger

 research designs should be conducted to assess
whether the observed relationship between being
high and risk perceptions about driving high or
drunk is causal and, if so, to clarify the influence
of impairment on risk perceptions. If being high af-
fects risk perceptions, the public health community
would do well to address this in campaign planning
and development. For example, campaigns to pre-
vent drugged or drunk driving must be influential at
a moment in which the audience is intoxicated. At
the moment in which a decision is made to drive or
not drive, an individual who is cognitively impaired
must recall and be persuaded by campaign messa-
ging. This study suggests that campaigns may bene-
fit from understanding how messaging functions
within the context of intoxication. A useful area
for future research would be to assess whether
some messages—including both content and mes-
sage characteristics—are more memorable or more
persuasive than others among those who are high.
This study also strongly suggests that online public
health surveys should routinely measure the propor-
tion of the sample that completed the survey while
under the influence of marijuana, alcohol or other
intoxicants. Studies designed to test and validate
survey items for measuring self-reported drug im-
pairment would be useful for future survey research.
