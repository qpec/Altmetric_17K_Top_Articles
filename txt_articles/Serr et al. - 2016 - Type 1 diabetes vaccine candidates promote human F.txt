Immune tolerance is executed partly by Foxp3 þregulatory T (Treg) cells, which suppress
autoreactive T cells. In autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D) impaired tolerance promotes
destruction of insulin-producing b-cells. The development of autoantigen-specific vaccination
strategies for Foxp3 þTreg-induction and prevention of islet autoimmunity in patients is still in
its infancy. Here, using human haematopoietic stem cell-engrafted NSG-HLA-DQ8 transgenic
mice, we provide direct evidence for human autoantigen-specific Foxp3 þTreg-induction
in vivo. We identify HLA-DQ8-restricted insulin-specific CD4 þT cells and demonstrate
efficient human insulin-specific Foxp3 þTreg-induction upon subimmunogenic vaccination
with strong agonistic insulin mimetopes in vivo. Induced human Tregs are stable, show
increased expression of Treg signature genes such as Foxp3, CTLA4, IL-2Ra and TIGIT and can
efficiently suppress effector T cells. Such Foxp3 þTreg-induction does not trigger any effector
Tcells. These T1D vaccine candidates could therefore represent an expedient improvement in
the challenge to induce human Foxp3 þTregs and to develop novel precision medicines for
prevention of islet autoimmunity in children at risk of T1D.

 T
ype 1 diabetes (T1D) afflicts millions of people worldwide
and is a severe chronic autoimmune disease characterized
by the progressive loss of self-tolerance to insulin-
producing pancreatic b-cells1. The incidence of T1D is rising
dramatically especially in young children2. T1D and other
autoimmune diseases are thought to develop when T cells with
specificity for weakly binding T-cell receptor (TCR) agonists,
which may include self-antigens, evade thymic negative selection
and then mount a peripheral autoimmune attack3–7. In children,
the appearance of multiple islet autoantibodies indicates the onset
of islet autoimmunity (pre-T1D)8. Insulin autoantibodies are
often the first to appear thereby highlighting the contribution of
insulin in initiating T1D autoimmunity9.
Regulatory T (Treg) cells are pivotal in preventing auto-
immunity. Impairments in Treg numbers, function and induction
critically contribute to autoimmune destruction in T1D. Tregs are
characterized by the expression of the high-affinity interleukin-2
(IL-2) receptor a-chain (IL-2Ra) and the X-linked gene forkhead
box P3 (Foxp3), encoding the transcription factor Foxp3,
which acts as a lineage specification factor for the development
and function of CD4 þCD25 þTregs10–13. The essential function
of human Foxp3 þTregs to avoid autoimmunity is illustrated by
the fatal autoimmune disease IPEX (immunodysregulation,
polyendocrinopathy,
enteropathy
and
X-linked
syndrome),
which is caused by mutations in the Foxp3 gene.
Foxp3 þTregs have attracted attention as they can ‘tame’ their
autoreactive counterparts by direct contact-dependent inhibition
of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and effector T cells or by
releasing inhibitory cytokines such as TGFb or IL-10. Tregs
maintain their regulatory functions for a long period of time even
in the absence of antigens that induced their generation and are
stable and transferable14, thereby permitting the prospective
induction of these cells to prevent unwanted immunity. We are
focusing on novel strategies using optimized variants of critical
autoantigens for Foxp3 þTreg induction since Tregs bear the
promise of specifically targeting the harmful effects of peripheral
autoreactive T cells to control autoimmunity such as that
observed in T1D while preserving the ability of the immune
system to fight off infections15–18. Optimal in vivo induction of
stable
murine
Foxp3 þTregs
requires
the
subimmunogenic
delivery of strongly agonistic TCR ligands to naive CD4 þ
T cells16,17,19–21. By contrast, even high immunogenic doses of
weakly agonistic ligands fail to induce stable Foxp3 þTregs17,22.
The most efficient Foxp3 þTreg induction is achieved in T cells
that
proliferated
least
extensively19.
Specific
Foxp3 þTreg
induction
in
the
context
of
autoimmunity
could
allow
modulating the immune response for clinical benefit while
limiting long-term immune suppression.
T1D mouse models as non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice showed
that insulin functions as an essential autoantigen23,24. In humans
and mice, T cell responses to insulin are highly focused on a
human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ8- or murine IAg7-restricted
segment of the insulin-B-chain comprising residues 9–23 and the
human epitope is identical to that of mouse insulin25–27. Initial
murine studies using subimmunogenic delivery of natural insulin
B-chain epitopes show only a limited Treg induction efficacy and
a slight delay in T1D progression17. As one possible means to
explain the poor efficacy of Treg induction by natural insulin
B-chain epitopes in murine T1D, it has been indicated that the
insulin-B-chain peptide is presented by I-Ag7 in a low-affinity
binding register, which results in weak-agonistic activity of the
peptide presented by the major histocompatibility complex
(MHC)II
(refs
7,28).
To
efficiently
induce
insulin-specific
Foxp3 þTregs that could interfere with the development of
T1D in NOD mice, we devised a strongly agonistic mimetope
of the natural insulin-B-chain-epitope (21E-22E) with improved
MHCII-binding7 and showed that its sub-immunogenic delivery
promoted efficient Foxp3 þTreg induction and T1D protection
for 40 weeks and longer17. Importantly, crystal structures of the
human T1D susceptibility HLA-DQ8 allele and the homologous
molecule in NOD mice, I-Ag7, reveal striking structural overlap
between the MHC-peptide binding pockets29, which suggests
similar peptide presentation events of insulin-epitopes in human
T1D. Accordingly, a recent study provides evidence that insulin
B:9-23-reactive CD4 þT cells are present in the peripheral blood
of T1D patients and that the immunogenic register of this
peptide has low-affinity binding to HLA-DQ8 (ref. 30). Moreover,
T1D risk may be related to how an HLA-DQ genotype determines
the balance of T-cell inflammatory versus regulatory responses
to insulin, having implications for insulin-specific therapies to
prevent T1D (ref. 31).
Currently, the majority of strategies approved by the FDA for
autoimmune diseases have focused on non-antigen-specific
immune suppression. Although this was found to be partially
effective in inhibiting autoreactivity, these compounds have
numerous
side
effects
and
long-term
treatment
remains
challenging. Strategies that promote autoantigen-specific Treg
induction will permit the specific blockade of the deleterious
effects
of
autoimmune
destruction
while
maintaining
the
ability of the immune system to clear non-autoantigens. While
promising results have been obtained in mice, in man the
development of autoantigen-specific
Foxp3 þTreg induction
strategies
is
still
in
its
infancy.
It
is
currently
unclear
whether concepts established for efficient murine in vivo
Foxp3 þTreg induction will be translatable to the human
immune system, especially in the context of autoimmune
diseases such as T1D. Further studies are needed that provide
mechanistic insights for the in vivo induction of human
autoantigen-specific Foxp3 þTregs. As an excellent accessible
system permitting predictive in vivo immunology research, here
we used human haematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-engrafted
NOD-Scid-IL2-receptor-g-chain
knockout
(NSG)-HLA-DQ8
transgenic mice and newly established autoantigen-specific Treg
induction.
We provide first direct evidence that a set of two novel human
insulin mimetopes promotes human Foxp3 þTreg induction in
human-HSC-engrafted NSG-HLA-DQ8 transgenic mice in vivo.
Such induced Tregs from humanized mice are stable over
prolonged periods of time, present with robust suppressive
capacities and harbour high abundance of Treg signature genes
such as Foxp3, CTLA4, IL-2Ra and TIGIT in the absence of
effector T-cell responses. These T1D vaccine candidates could
critically contribute to the development of efficient autoantigen-
specific
Treg
induction
strategies
for
prevention
of
islet
autoimmunity in children at risk of developing T1D.

Agonistic activity of insulin mimetopes in CD4 þT cells.
To
define
optimal
conditions
for
human
insulin-specific
Foxp3 þTreg induction we tested agonistic activities of four
insulin-B-chain-10-23 mimetopes. Peptide selections were made
first based on the finding that insulin-B:10-23 peptide variants
with a mutation of arginine (R) to glutamic acid (E) at position 22
and/or including a change to glycine (G) at position 21
(ins.mim.2 ¼ 21G-22E; ins.mim.3 ¼ 21E-22E) were more potent
in stimulating murine insulin-specific CD4 þT cells7,17,28 and
stimulated human insulin-specific CD4 þT cells30,31. The use of
either E or G at position 21 was included based on findings in
NOD mice that insulin B:9–23-specific CD4 þT cells can be
divided into types A and B T cells. Both recognize the peptide
bound to IAg7 in register 3. However, type A T cells prefer the

 glutamic acid at position 21 as TCR-binding residue while type
B cells prefer glycine 21 (ref. 28).
Second, we set up two novel human insulin mimetopes with
mutations
at
position
22
to
glutamic
acid
(E)
together
with position 21 being E or G and an additional mutation of
position 14 from alanine (A) to glutamic acid (E) (ins.mim.1 ¼ 14
E-21G-22E;
ins.mim.4 ¼ 14E-21E-22E).
The
mutation
at
position 14 was included since structural analyses of a human
insulin-peptide-HLA-DQ8 complex had suggested that glutamic
acid ( ¼ E) is preferred over alanine at the first MHC-anchor29
(Supplementary Fig. 1 for peptide sequences).
Proliferative
responses
were
assessed
using
polyclonal
CFSE-labelled CD4 þT cells from eight islet autoantibody positive
HLA-DQ8 þ children. Comparisons were made upon stimulation
with either the natural insulin-B-chain-epitope or a set of
insulin-B-chain mimetopes or as controls left untreated. When
the proportion of cells with diluted CFSE-label was determined,
the insulin mimetopes showed increased stimulatory capacities
when
compared
with
the
natural
insulin-B-chain
epitope
(unstimulated: 6.2±0.2 versus insulin B:9-23: 6.4±0.3 versus
insulin mimetopes: 13.7±1.4 CFSEdimCD45RO þCD25 þT cells
in % of CD4 þT cells, Po0.01, Fig. 1).
Moreover, a combination of ins.mim.1 ¼ 14E-21G-22E and
ins.mim.4 ¼ 14E-21E-22E
resulted
in
significantly
enhanced
stimulation when compared with ins.mim.2 ¼ 21G-22E and
ins.mim.3 ¼ 21E-22E) either in CD4 þT cells from non-diabetic
children with ongoing islet autoimmunity (Fig. 1d, Po0.01) or
without autoimmunity (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Ex vivo identification of human insulin-specific Tregs. Next,
based on their enhanced stimulatory potential, agonistic activity
and in accordance with identified crystal structures29 we
employed
14E-21G-22E
(ins.mim.1)
and
14E-21E-22E
(ins.mim.4) for the development of insulin-specific HLA-DQ8-
tetramers.
CD4 þT-cell
enrichment
before
flow
cytometric
enumeration distinctly increased sensitivity of detection of
insulin-specific CD4 þT cells. Virtually no tetramer þCD4 þ
T cells were detected with the HLA-DQ8 control tetramers and
by using CD4 þT cells from an HLA-DQ8-negative donor
(Fig.
2a,b).
By
contrast,
insulin
mimetope-specific
CD4 þ
T
cells
were
readily
identified
ex
vivo
using
HLA-DQ8
insulin
mimetope-specific
tetramers,
and
frequencies
of
tetramer þCD4 þT cells were correlated with CD3 expression
(second right and right plots in Fig. 2b).
To permit for the first time the direct ex vivo identification of
human HLA-DQ8-restricted insulin-specific Foxp3 þTregs we
used pre-enriched CD4 þT cells and newly developed settings to
combine tetramer stainings with multiparameter flow cytometry
and intracellular Foxp3 staining (Fig. 2c).
To verify the specificity of the tetramer þCD4 þT cells for
the insulin mimetope and insulin B:9–23 itself, tetramer þ
cells were sort-purified and expanded in a polyclonal fashion.
Re-stimulation of CD4 þT cells with the insulin mimetopes
induced rapid proliferation, as determined by dilution of
the CFSE label (Fig. 2d). The CD4 þT cells likewise responded
to the natural insulin B:9–23 epitope, albeit to a lesser extent
(right plot in Fig. 2d).
Insulin-specific Foxp3 þTregs and autoimmune progression.
HLA-DQ8-restricted insulin mimetope-specific CD4 þT cells
were identified in children without and with various durations of
islet
autoimmunity
(disease
categories:
no
autoimmunity:
islet autoantibody negative, recent activation: multiple islet
autoantibodies for o5 years and long-term autoimmunity:
multiple islet autoantibodies 410 years, Fig. 3a,c). Likewise
such T cells were found in children with recent-onset or
longterm
T1D
(Supplementary
Fig.
3).
At
least
8 � 106
and up to 40 � 106 cells were acquired and HLA-DQ8-
restricted
insulin
mimetope-specific
CD4 þT
cells
were
detected in a range of 0.001–0.01% of CD4 þT cells (see summary
graph in Fig. 3c). These frequencies of insulin mimetope-specific
CD4 þT cells are in accordance with the range that has been
estimated for islet-antigen-specific CD4 þT cells, for example for
proinsulin76-90-specific CD4 þT cells the frequency has been
estimated to be B1 in 300,000 PBMCs32,33. Phenotyping of
HLA-DQ8-restricted insulin mimetope-specific CD4 þT cells
revealed an increase in the frequency of cells with a memory
phenotype according to the duration of islet autoimmunity
(Fig. 3d).
In young at-risk children, T1D can develop within several
months of the appearance of autoantibodies. However, it may
take more than a decade in some children8,9, supporting
the
concept
of
episodes
of
successful
immune
tolerance.
Of
interest,
frequencies
of
insulin
mimetope-specific
Foxp3 þTregs were significantly lower in children with recent
onset of autoimmunity than in children without autoimmunity
(no autoimmunity versus recent onset of autoimmunity: 1.9±0.9
versus 0.5±0.4% of Tet þCD4 þT cells, Po0.05, Fig. 3e).
We
identified enhanced
frequencies of
insulin mimetope-
specific Foxp3 þTregs in non-diabetic children with longterm
autoimmunity (long-term autoimmunity versus recent onset
of autoimmunity: 11.7±0.9 versus 0.5±0.4 Foxp3 þTregs as a
% of Tet þCD4 þT cells, Po0.001, Fig. 3e), indicative of at
least periods of successful ongoing immune regulation in
such children. To further support a critical role of insulin
mimetope-specific
Tregs
in
delaying
progression
of
islet
autoimmunity to clinically overt T1D, frequencies of insulin
mimetope-specific Tregs were found to be severely reduced in
children with newly diagnosed T1D and a very early disease
manifestation (age at diagnosis r5 years) (Fig. 3e). These
findings underscore the rationale of inducing autoantigen-specific
Tregs for delaying T1D progression.
Agonistic activity of insulin mimetopes in CD4 þT-cell clones.
To determine agonistic activities of the individual insulin
mimetopes we generated HLA-DQ8-restricted insulin mime-
tope-specific CD4 þT-cell clones from children without islet
autoimmunity or with various durations of islet autoimmunity.
For the stimulation of human CD4 þT cells and T-cell cloning
we used HLA-DQ8 insulin mimetope-specific artificial APCs
expressing
insulinB:chain-10-23-mimetopes
(14E-21G-22E
(ins.mim.1)
and
14E-21E-22E
(ins.mim.4))
which
were
established using antibody-coupling beads, DQ-antibodies34 and
unlabelled
insulin
mimetope-specific
HLA-DQ8-tetramers.
CD4 þT
cells
responding
to
stimulation
with
insulin
mimetope-specific artificial APCs were single-cell-sorted as
CFSEdimCD25highCD4 þT cells. In control experiments using
HLA-DQ8-expressing
artificial
APCs
fused
to
irrelevant
peptides
no
dilution
of
the
CFSE-label
was
observed
(Supplementary Fig. 4).
Insulin-specificity

growing

clones
was
confirmed upon stimulation with insulin mimetopes in the
presence
or
absence
of
DQ-blocking
antibodies,
analysed
flow-cytometrically
by
CD25
upregulation
(Fig.
4a,b)
and
confirmed by analyses of the highest CD25 levels (CD25 þ þ þ
levels, Fig. 4c,d and Supplementary Fig. 5). All tested CD4 þT-cell
clones also responded to the natural insulin B:9-23 epitope albeit
to a lower extent (Fig. 4e,f and Supplementary Fig. 5). These data
show that T cells cloned from CD4 þT cells responding to
insulin-B-chain-10-23 mimetopes are likewise specific for the

3
 natural insulin B:9-23 epitope (Fig. 4e,f and Supplementary
Fig. 5).
The set of four insulin-B-chain-10-23 mimetopes was used
to assess their individual proliferative capacities (ins.mim.
2 ¼ 21G-22E; ins.mim.3 ¼ 21E-22E; ins.mim.1 ¼ 14E-21G-22E;
ins.mim.4 ¼ 14E-21E-22E) in generated insulin-specific CD4 þ
T-cell clones (Fig. 4g). The stimulatory potential of the individual
insulin
mimetopes
is
shown
in
fold
of
the
stimulation
achieved with the natural insulin B:9-23 epitope. Irrespective
of the presence or duration of autoimmunity (Fig. 4g) all
insulin-variants were superior in stimulating insulin-specific
CD4 þT-cell clones. In particular ins.mim.4 (ins.mim.4 ¼ 14E-
21E-22E) presented with a significantly enhanced stimulatory
capacity
(Po0.05)
when
compared
with
ins.mim.2
(ins.mim.2 ¼ 21G-22E) and ins.mim.3 (ins.mim.3 ¼ 21E-22E).
A summary of the stimulatory capacities of all tested insulin-
specific CD4 þT-cell clones is outlined in Fig. 4g. These
findings are in accordance with our observations obtained from
competitive in vitro HLA-DQ8 binding assays (Fig. 4h) where
ins.mim.4 presented with the highest affinity to HLA-DQ8
(IC50 ¼ 0.9 mM) when compared with ins.mim.3 (IC50 ¼ 2.1 mM),
ins.mim.2 (IC50 ¼ 6.3 mM), ins.mim.1 (IC50 ¼ 3.2 mM) and the
natural insulin B:9-23 epitope (IC50 ¼ 14.8 mM).
Human insulin-specific Foxp3 þTreg induction in vitro. In
agreement with their enhanced stimulatory potential, agonistic
activity, in reference to identified categories of types A and B
T cells28 and in accordance with identified crystal structures29
we used ins.mim.1 (14E-21G-22E) and ins.mim.4 (14E-21E-22E)
to determine human insulin-specific Foxp3 þTreg induction.
We set up human in vitro Foxp3 þTreg induction mimicking
subimmunogenic TCR stimulation16,35. We developed a protocol
for human insulin-specific Foxp3 þTreg induction without TGFb
using premature withdrawal of TCR stimulation building up on
murine studies35. Highly pure human naive CD4 þT cells isolated
from children with or without islet autoimmunity (Fig. 5a–c;
disease
categories:
no
autoimmunity,
recent
activation
of
autoimmunity and longterm autoimmunity) were used as a

Fig.

When
analysed
at
20
weeks
post
reconstitution
NSG-HLA-DQ8 mice presented with successful CD4 þT-cell
development in pooled spleen and lymph nodes (3.9±0.4% of
human CD45 þ leukocytes, Fig. 8, n ¼ 8 from two independent
experiments) and peripheral blood (Supplementary Fig. 7) in
accordance with previous studies36. Upon reconstitution we
likewise identified in those animals other immune subsets, for
example, human CD8 þT cells and B cells (Supplementary Fig. 8).
To characterize insulin mimetope-specific CD4 þT cells we
used
insulin-HLA-DQ8-tetramers.
Of
note,
we
identified
HLA-DQ8-restricted insulin mimetope-specific CD4 þT cells
indicating successful positive selection on human HLA-DQ8
molecules in those humanized mice (0.2±0.2 of human CD4 þ
T cells, Fig. 8). Expression levels of tetramer þCD4 þT cells
correlated with CD3. No tetramer þCD4 þT cells were detected
with the control tetramers. Two-third of the insulin-specific
CD4 þT-cell fraction were in a naive CD45RA þstate (Fig. 8c,
middle plot) therefore suitable for Foxp3 þTreg induction. HLA-
DQ8-restricted
insulin-specific
CD4 þT
cells
were
likewise
identified in peripheral blood but not in CD4 þT cells purified
from white adipose tissues (WATs) (Supplementary Fig. 9).
Human insulin-specific Foxp3 þTreg induction in vivo. To
determine
human
insulin-specific
Foxp3 þTreg
induction
in vivo using subimmunogenic TCR stimulation reconstituted
NSG-HLA-DQ8 mice were subcutaneously implanted with
osmotic
mini-pumps
infusing
minute
amounts
of
insulin
mimetopes (5 mg per day for 14 days). Based on optimal CD4 þ
T-cell development vaccination was done at 20 weeks post
reconstitution. In accordance with their enhanced stimulatory
potential as identified in insulin-specific CD4 þT-cell clones
(Figs 1 and 4) and optimal in vitro Treg induction (Fig. 5)
we chose a combination of ins.mim.1 ¼ 14E-21G-22E and
ins.mim.4 ¼ 14E-21E-22E for in vivo Foxp3 þTreg induction.
Human CD127lowCD25 þTregs were identified in humanized
NSG-HLA-DQ8 mice in peripheral blood and spleen (Fig. 9a,b).
Treg identity within CD127lowCD25 þT cells was verified by
intracellular staining for Foxp3 (Fig. 9c).
Three weeks after subimmunogenic vaccination with insulin
mimetopes humanized NSG-HLA-DQ8 mice showed significantly
increased
frequencies
of
human
CD127lowCD25þTregs
(Fig. 9d, þ PBS: CD127lowCD25þ
Tregs: 2.8±0.4% versus þ
insulin
mimetopes:
CD127lowCD25þ
Tregs:
10.2±1.0%;
Po0.001). Upon application of insulin mimetopes we also
identified
HLA-DQ8-restricted
insulin-specific
CD127low
CD25highTregs (Supplementary Fig. 10).
Moreover, when CD4 þT cells were isolated from pancreatic
islets we identified increased frequencies of CD127lowCD25 þ
Tregs in NSG mice that had received insulin mimetopes for Treg
induction in contrast to control animals treated with PBS
(Supplementary Fig. 11).
Next, when we analysed Ki67 expression in insulin mimetopes
treated NSG mice, we observed a higher proliferative potential
of CD127lowCD25highTregs purified from lymph nodes when
compared
with
peripheral
blood
and
pancreatic
islets
(Supplementary Fig. 12).
Signatures of induced Tregs in NSG-HLA-DQ8 mice. Upon

and
IL-2Ra which impact Treg physiology. In addition, we observed
significantly increased abundance of TIGIT which has been
reported as important for Treg suppressive function39,40 and
RTKN2 which was shown to share the unique Treg signature
expression pattern while its functional role in Treg biology
remains largely undefined37 (Fig. 10a). Upon subimmunogenic
vaccination with insulin mimetopes we did not observe any
significant changes in IKZF2 encoding Helios, nor in ENTPD1
(encoding CD39, a Treg effector molecule41). Moreover, no
upregulation of T effector cell genes such as IL-17Ra and IL-21
was seen (Supplementary Fig. 13, abundance of NFATc2, RORgt,
T-bet and IFNg were below the lower limit of detection).
Stability of human Foxp3 þTregs induced in vivo. To assess the
methylation status of the Foxp3 CNS2 region (Treg-specific
demethylated region (TSDR)) we used high-resolution melting
(HRM)-PCR and pyrosequencing (Supplementary Fig. 14). The
TSDR region is critically involved in maintaining longterm
stability of Foxp3 expression42,43. We first evaluated the Foxp3
TSDR methylation status in ex vivo human CD4 þT cell/Treg
populations from male and female donors (Supplementary
Fig. 15a,b). Because of the fact that the Foxp3 gene is X-linked,
levels of Foxp3 TSDR methylation were higher in T cells from
female compared with male donors.

we
found
that

human

purified

(Supplementary Fig. 15c). The methylation status of such
Tregs
from
humanized
mice
induced
by

of
insulin mimetopes was as low as levels seen in ex vivo
human Foxp3highTreg populations (Supplementary Fig. 15).
In
contrast,
the
TSDR

from
naive

of such humanized NSG mice was completely methylated
(Supplementary Fig. 15c).
To further assess the stability of human Tregs induced
upon subimmunogenic TCR stimulation in vivo, humanized
NSG-HLA-DQ8 mice were maintained for 6 months upon
Treg induction. After 6 months humanized NSG mice that
had received insulin mimetopes for Foxp3 þTreg induction
presented with significantly enhanced abundance of Foxp3,
CTLA4,
IL-2Ra
and
TIGIT
compared
with
control
animals (Supplementary Fig. 16a). Moreover, 6 months after
subimmunogenic vaccination no upregulation of T effector cell
genes had occurred (Supplementary Fig. 16b). In accordance,
CD4 þT cells from such humanized NSG mice also harboured
reduced

of

 These findings are in accordance with data obtained in murine
T1D. We purified CD4 þT cells from pancreatic lymph nodes
of 40-week-old NOD Foxp3-GFP reporter mice that had
either received the natural insulin-B-chain epitope or insulin
mimetope (ins.mim.3 ¼ 21E-22E) for Treg induction at the
age of 4–6 weeks. Using two fluorescent insulin mimetope-
specific IAg7-tetramers (21G-22E- and 21E-22E-tetramer)28 we
showed that NOD mice that had received the insulin mimetope
and
were
still
diabetes-free
presented
with
significantly
increased frequencies of insulin-specific Foxp3 þTregs (7.2±1.8
versus 20.2±1.7% of insulin-specific CD4 þT cells, Po0.01,
Supplementary Fig. 17).
Moreover, T cells purified directly from the islets of NOD mice
that
had

insulin
mimetopes

presented with increased frequencies of stable Foxp3 þTregs
accompanied

CD127lowCD25highTregs and conventional T cells were sort-
purified from spleens and lymph nodes and first expanded using
polyclonal stimulation. Tregs and conventional T cells were rested
for 16 h in the absence of IL-2 to force them into synchronous
resting
states44.
Suppression
of
proliferative

of
conventional CD4 þT cells was then determined by analysing
the dilution of their CFSE label in the presence or absence of
Tregs. Ex vivo human Tregs presented with potent suppressive
capacities (% suppression of responder cell proliferation: Treg:

1:2 ¼ 96.1±0.4;
1:4 ¼ 64.1±3.8;
1:8 ¼ 30.8±3.0;
Fig. 10b,c).
Next, we performed suppression assays with HLA-DQ8-
restricted insulin-specific T-cell clones cloned from children with
ongoing islet autoimmunity as responder cells and insulin
mimetopes or insulin B:9-23 for stimulation. Induced Tregs
from humanized mice suppressed insulin mimetope-specific
proliferation (% suppression of insulin-specific responder cells
proliferation: Treg: responder 1:1 ¼ 80.3±3.5; 1:2 ¼ 62.8±12.7;
1:4 ¼ 48.2±8.7; 1:8 ¼ 43.2±5.5; Fig. 10d). Likewise, such Tregs
suppressed proliferation of insulin-specific T-cell clones upon
stimulation with insulin B:9–23 (% suppression of insulin-specific
responder cells proliferation: Treg: responder 1:1 ¼ 73.5±2.5;
1:2 ¼ 64.5±4.4; 1:4 ¼ 41.8±2.7; and 1:8 ¼ 27.6±1.5; Fig. 10e).
Moreover, such induced Tregs from humanized mice sup-
pressed responder T-cell proliferation using effector T cells from
T1D patients (% suppression of responder cells proliferation:
Treg: responder 1:1 ¼ 46.6±2.3; 1:2 ¼ 21.4±2.4; 1:4 ¼ 15.6±1.6;

Control of autoimmunity through instruction of endogenous
regulatory mechanisms is a long envisioned challenging goal
of
physicians
and
scientists18.
In

the
development
of autoantigen-specific tolerance induction strategies is still in
its infancy and currently studies are ongoing. Initial results
from clinical trials using natural autoantigens for induction of
self-tolerance, for example, natural insulin in T1D showed
thus far little benefit45–48. More recently, a first primary

dose-finding
study
in
children
genetically susceptible to T1D was finished49 where oral insulin
application to children genetically at risk but without ongoing
islet autoimmunity supported an immune response.
To further advance the translation of these antigen-specific
therapies from bench to bedside it will be critical to investigate
whether the choice of antigen, the time point and route
of administration induced a tolerogenic response and specifically
to study the conditions for efficient human Foxp3 þTreg
induction. It has been suggested that efficacy of tolerance
induction may critically depend upon: disease state, antigen
dosage, route of administration, the study cohort that is treated
and the choice of antigen, for example, insulin versus insulin
B chain peptides.
In humans, T1D risk is linked strongly to combinations of the
HLA-DR4/DQ8
and
DR3/DQ2
haplotypes50
with
90%
of
T1D patients harbouring DQ8 or DQ2 alleles. HLA-DQ8 shares
with
I-Ag7
strikingly
similar
binding
pockets
for
peptide
presentation29. Insulin B:9-23-reactive CD4 þT cells are present
in the peripheral blood of T1D individuals, the immunogenic
register of this peptide has low-affinity binding to HLA-DQ8
(ref. 30) and a strong agonistic variant of the natural insulin
epitope established in the murine system7 can efficiently stimulate
human CD4 þT cells31.
Here, we identify two novel human insulin mimetopes
(ins.mim.1 ¼ 14E-21G-22E and ins.mim.4 ¼ 14E-21E-22E) with
increased stimulatory capacities when compared with the natural
insulin
B:9-23
epitope
and
previously
established
insulin
variants7,17,30,31. The combination of ins.mim.1 and ins.mim.4
was chosen to use as the best stimulating mimetic within each
category of insulin-reactive CD4 þT cells, namely type A and type
B cells, as suggested in the NOD mouse setting28. However, based

 on its highest affinity to HLA-DQ8 ins.mim.4 (14E-21E-22E) will
probably contribute most to the observed functional effects.
Tetramers using ins.mim.1 and ins.mim.4 permitted for the
first time the direct ex vivo identification of human insulin
mimetope-specific
CD4 þT
cells
without
prior
in
vitro
expansion30 and combined with intracellular Foxp3 staining the
immediate
analysis
of
insulin
mimetope-specific
Foxp3 þ
Tregs. We have demonstrated that high frequencies of insulin
mimetope-specific Tregs were associated with profound delays in
T1D progression in children, which supports the rationale for
inducing insulin-specific Foxp3 þ
Tregs to delay or even
prevent human T1D. Moreover, these data are consistent with
the observation that children with slowly progressing phenotypes
display
an
accumulation
of
protective
genotypes
in
T1D
susceptibility genes51 most notably IL-2, IL2-Ra, INS VNTR
and IL-10.
The ability to directly identify human insulin-specific Foxp3 þ
Tregs ex vivo will be of critical relevance to assess insulin-specific
vaccination responses. This is a critical step currently missing in
clinical T1D prevention efforts and will support the development
of novel T cell-specific biomarkers alongside personalized
strategies for efficient prevention of islet autoimmunity and T1D.
The
best
stimulating
human
insulin
mimetopes
when
applied at low subimmunogenic doses were also most efficient
in
inducing
human
insulin-specific
Foxp3 þTregs.
These
results are in accord with observations in NOD mice where
subimmunogenic doses of strongly stimulating insulin mimetopes
efficiently
induced
insulin-specific
Foxp3 þTregs
which
prevented
T1D
development17.
Here,
we
provide
novel
conceptual evidence for using low doses of strong-agonistic
insulin mimetopes for efficient human Foxp3 þTreg induction
and suppression of human autoimmunity.
With respect to safety aspects of insulin-specific vaccination
strategies, recently a first primary insulin-specific vaccination
dose-finding study in children genetically susceptible to T1D was
completed49. Application of high doses of insulin to genetically
at-risk healthy children without signs of islet autoimmunity
promoted an immune response without hypoglycemia. The
incidence and type of adverse events were not different
between children who received placebo and children who
received insulin, regardless of the insulin dose49.
Moreover, insulin peptides have also proved safe at early stages
of clinical development, supporting the concept for epitope-based
vaccines52.
Concerning the time point of vaccination for Treg induction,
we show that this process was most efficient in naive T cells from
children without ongoing autoimmunity or in non-diabetic
children with long-term autoimmunity. It is therefore suggested
that insulin mimetope-specific Foxp3 þTreg induction may be
better applied as a primary preventive approach or as a secondary
vaccination strategy for non-diabetic children with longer
autoimmunity that have successfully passed the critical period
of autoimmune development without progression to overt disease
(longterm autoimmunity without T1D).
Mechanistically, recent data highlight a critical impact of
peptide-MHC quality (stimulation by a strong-agonistic ligand)
versus quantity on in vivo T-cell responses53. Evidence for
ligand discrimination beyond sensing of a cumulative TCR
signal in that T cell responses differed between low-density and
low-potency weak stimuli17,22,53–55 was provided. These findings
underline the importance of integrating peptide-MHC quality
and quantity in determining the minimal TCR stimulation
required for T-cell proliferation in vivo53 and support our
observations that most efficient stable Foxp3 þTreg induction is
achieved by a subimmunogenic stimulus of a strong-agonistic
ligand17. Accordingly, Tregs induced in humanized NSG mice

 presented with a demethylated TSDR region and were maintained
for prolonged periods of time in the absence of effector cell
responses.
More studies are required to gain an improved understanding
of how the subimmunogenic application of antigens for the
efficient and stable induction of Foxp3 þTreg cells can be best
achieved in human autoimmune diseases. These efforts might
include novel strategies for the application of self-antigens—for
example, the use of dissolving microneedle patches56, which were
recently tested for the administration of insulin to individuals
with T1D57. Such novel application strategies could help to mimic
continuous subimmunogenic antigen application promoting
efficient Foxp3 þTreg induction. Safety and efficacy of such
novel devices for vaccination have been recently tested on human
skin58,59.
It has been shown that human HSC-engrafted NSG mice
harbour a highly-diverse TCR repertoire, which is critical for
mounting an efficient yet not self-destructive adaptive immune
response60. The replacement of mouse MHC molecules by
human MHC components has been a major advance in
increasing the utility of these ‘humanized’ mice as this permits
the generation and maintenance of robust human T cell
responses61.
In reconstituted NSG-HLA-DQ8 mice we provide first direct
evidence for HLA-DQ8-restricted insulin-specific CD4 þT-cell
responses indicating positive selection on human HLA-DQ8

 molecules. Moreover, this will allow studying the requirements
for human insulin-specific Foxp3 þTreg induction in further
detail.
In sum, in the pre-clinical setting of humanized NSG-HLA-
DQ8
transgenic
mice
we
established
for
the
first
time
subimmunogenic Foxp3 þTreg induction and demonstrate that
subimmunogenic application of insulin mimetopes promotes
enhanced levels of insulin-specific Foxp3 þTregs in a human
immune system in vivo. Moreover, such induced Tregs were
found to be stable and presented with robust suppressive
capacities and increased abundance of Treg signature genes.
It remains challenging to interfere with processes that generate
autoimmune T1D in patients; however, defining the requirements
for efficient human insulin-specific Foxp3 þTreg induction
in vivo as evidenced here by the establishment of subimmuno-
genic vaccination protocols in humanized mice alongside the
development of novel human insulin mimetopes could represent
a critical improvement in this challenge.
Methods
Human subjects and blood samples. For the present study blood samples were
collected from children or adults who are first degree relatives of patients with T1D.
Written consent was obtained for the Munich Bioresource project (approval number
#5049/11, approval committee: Technische Universita
¨t Mu
¨nchen, Munich,
Germany). All subjects have been already enrolled into longitudinal studies with
prospective follow-up from birth62–64 with the documented age of islet
autoantibody seroconversion (initiation of islet autoimmunity). Venous blood was
collected using sodium heparin tubes and blood volumes collected were based on
EU guidelines with a maximal blood volume of 2.4 ml kg � 1 of body weight.
Subjects have been stratified based on the presence or absence of multiple islet
autoantibodies ( ¼ with or without pre-T1D) and based on the duration of islet
autoantibody positivity: no autoimmunity: first degree relatives of patients with
T1D who are islet autoantibody negative (n ¼ 11; median age ¼ 8 years,
interquartile range (IQR) ¼ 6–12 years, six males, five females); recent onset of islet
autoimmunity: subjects with multiple islet autoantibodies for less than 5 years
(n ¼ 7, median age ¼ 5 years, IQR ¼ 4–14 years, five males, two females); persistent
autoimmunity: subjects with multiple islet autoantibodies for more than 5 but less
than 10 years (n ¼ 9, median age ¼ 14 years, IQR ¼ 10–17.5 years, 7 males, two
females); longterm autoimmunity: subjects with multiple islet autoantibodies for
more than a decade who did not yet develop T1D (n ¼ 7, median age ¼ 15 years,
IQR ¼ 14–25 years, three males, four females). In addition five children with newly
diagnosed T1D and very early disease manifestation (disease onseto5 years) were
studied (n ¼ 5, median age ¼ 4 years, IQR ¼ 2–8 years, two males, three females)
and six children with longterm T1D for 45 years have been included (n ¼ 6,
median age ¼ 14, IQR ¼ 11.5–16.5 years, five males, one female). Umbilical cord
blood from healthy full-term newborns, acquired immediately after delivery from
the clamped umbilical cord was collected in citrate phosphate dextrose, including
one from a child of a mother with T1D. Samples (n ¼ 6) were provided through the
DKMS Cord Blood Bank of the University Hospital Dresden (Germany) or from
the Institute of Diabetes Research, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universita
¨t
Mu
¨nchen with informed consent and local ethics committee approval (approval
number: #5293/12, Technische Universita
¨t Mu
¨nchen, Munich, Germany).
Mice. NOD.129X1(Cg)-Foxp3tm2Tch/DvsJ mice, referred to as NOD Foxp3 GFP
reporter mice, were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Antigen-specific
in vivo Treg cell conversion protocols were executed based on established
protocols17: Four weeks-old female NOD Foxp3 GFP reporter mice were implanted
subcutaneously with osmotic mini-pumps (Alzet) releasing 5 mg day � 1 of insulin
mimetopes or the natural insulin-B-chain epitope for 14 days. Mice were
randomized to test groups for antigen-specific Treg conversion. No animals were
excluded due to illness or outlier results; therefore, no exclusion determination was
required. For ex vivo analyses of induced insulin-specific Foxp3 GFP þ Tregs, the
entire group of mice for treatment with either the natural insulin-epitope or the
strong-agonistic mimetope was analysed. NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid H2-Ab1tm1Gru
Il2rgtm1Wjl Tg(HLA-DQA1,HLA-DQB1)1Dv//Sz mice lack mouse MHC class II
and transgenically express human HLA-DQ8. These mice were developed by
Leonard Shultz at the Jackson Laboratory. To develop this stock, B10M-HLA-DQ8
mice were kindly provided by Dr. Chella David65. The DQ8 transgene was
backcrossed for 10 generations on the NSG strain background. The NSG-DQ8
mice were then intercrossed with NSG mice lacking mouse MHC class II
(NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid H2-Ab1tm1Gru Il2rgtm1Wjl) (ref. 66). The HLA-DQ8 mice were
bred and maintained group-housed on a 12-h/12-h light dark cycle at 25 �C with
free access to food and water under defined flora at the animal facility of Helmholtz
Zentrum Mu
¨nchen, Munich, Germany and at The Jackson Laboratory according to
guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Committees at each institution.
These mice were used as hosts for human HSC obtained from human HLA-DQ8
cord blood samples. The sex of the recipient mice was matched for the HSC donor
sex. Ethical approval for all mouse experimentations has been received by the
District Government of Upper Bavaria, Munich, Germany (approval numbers:
#55.2-1-54-2532-81-12 and 55.2-1-54-2532-84-12). The investigators were not
blinded to group allocation during the in vivo experiments or to the assessment of
experimental end points.
Isolation of infiltrating T cells from murine pancreata. Pancreata were digested
with collagenase V (1 mg ml � 1) in PBS with 0.1 mM HEPES and 0.1% BSA for
4–7 min at 37 �C. The cell suspension was passed through a 100 mm cell strainer
and stained for flow-cytometric analysis.
Human cell isolation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated
by density centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare). HSCs were
purified from PBMCs from fresh umbilical cord blood using the CD34 þ isolation
kit (Diamond CD34 Isolation kit human, Miltenyi Biotec) according to the
manufacturer’s protocols. Human Dendritic cells (DCs) were purified from
autologous PBMC samples using the Blood DC Isolation Kit (Blood DC Isolation
kit II human, Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Specifically CD14 þ and CD19 þ cells were labelled with magnetic beads and
depleted from the PBMC sample by separation on a MACS column. Subsequently
the remaining cells were labelled with CD304, CD1c and CD414 magnetic beads
and positive selection over a MACS column of CD304 þ plasmacytoid and CD1c þ
and CD141 þ myeloid DCs was performed. Human CD4 þT cells were isolated
from fresh PBMCs via negative magnetic bead enrichment (EasySep Human CD4
T Cell enrichment kit, Stem Cell) following the manufacturer’s protocol.

To detect intracellular protein expression of Foxp3, after surface staining, cells
were fixed and permeabilized using the Foxp3 Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience).
Cells were acquired on a Becton Dickinson LSR-II or on the BD FACSAria III cell
sorting system flow cytometer using FACSDiva software with optimal
compensation and gain settings determined for each experiment based on
unstained and single-colour stained samples. Doublets were excluded based on
SSC-A versus SSC-W plots. Live cell populations were gated on the basis of cell side
and forward scatter and the exclusion of cells positive for 7-AAD (BD Biosciences)
for murine stainings and Sytox Blue (Life Technologies) or Fixable Viability Dye
eFluor450 (eBioscience) for human stainings. Samples were analysed using FlowJo
software version 7.6.1 (TreeStar Inc., OR).
Peptides. Peptides at 495% purity were synthesized and purified at New England
Peptide (Boston, USA) or at JPT Peptides (Berlin, Germany). Peptide sequences.
HA307-319 epitope: H2N-PKYVKQNTLKLAT-OH, natural insulin B:9-23 epitope:
H2N-SHLVEALVLVCGERG-OH, four insulin-B-chain-10-23-mimetopes
(Supplementary Fig. 1) were employed in studies using human CD4 þT cells.
Peptides were chosen first based on the finding that insulin-B:10-23 peptide
variants with a mutation of arginine (R) to glutamic acid (E) at position 22
and/or including a change to glycine (G) at position 21 (ins.mim.2 ¼ 21G-22E;
ins.mim.3 ¼ 21E-22E) were indicated to be more potent in stimulating murine
insulin-specific CD4 þT cells7,17,28 and also suited to stimulate human
insulin-specific CD4 þT cells30,31.

 Second, two novel human insulin mimetopes with mutations at position 22 to
glutamic acid (E) together with position 21 being E or G as well as an
additional mutation of position 14 from alanine (A) to glutamic acid (E)
(ins.mim.1 ¼ 14E-21G-22E; ins.mim.4 ¼ 14E-21E-22E) were set up. The mutation
at position 14 was included since structural analyses of a human insulin-
peptide-HLA-DQ8 complex had suggested that glutamic acid ( ¼ E) is preferred
over alanine at the first MHC-anchor29.
Insulin-specific IAg7-restricted tetramer staining. Tetramer stainings have
been performed using established insulin mimetope-specific 22E- and 21G-22E-
tetramers28. In brief, untouched CD4 þT cells were incubated with tetramer
reagents for 1 hour at 37 �C in humidified 5% CO2 with gentle agitation
every 30 min followed by direct staining with antibodies for additional surface
markers and exclusion of dead cells for 20 min at 4 �C. A set of exclusion markers
(CD8, CD11b, CD11c, B220, F4/80 and a dead cell exclusion marker (Sytox Blue))
was used to increase specificity of the staining. As a negative control, we used a
tetramer of IAg7 with the well-characterized peptide from hen egg lysozyme
labelled with PE.
Insulin-specific HLA-DQ8-restricted tetramer staining. Fluorescent HLA-
DQ8-tetramers based on insulin-B-chain-10-23-mimetopes were developed in
collaboration with the NIH tetramer facility. Specifically, two of the insulin-
HLA-DQ8-PE-labelled tetramers were combined in stainings: a 14E-21E-22E and a
14E-21G-22E-tetramer were used to identify human insulin-specific CD4 þT cells.
For the HLA-DQ8-restricted insulin-specific tetramer stainings PBMCs were used
and CD4 þT cells were purified by negative MACS selection as described above.
To this end, untouched CD4 þT cells were incubated with insulin-specific
HLA-DQ8-tetramers for 1 hour at 37 �C in humidified 5% CO2 with gentle
agitation every 20 min followed by direct staining with antibodies for additional
surface markers and exclusion of dead cells (Sytox Blue) for 20 min at 4 �C. A set of
exclusion markers (CD8, CD11b, CD19, CD14 and a dead cell exclusion marker
(Sytox Blue)) was used to increase specificity of the staining. As negative controls,
we used a combination of two HLA-DQ8-tetramers fused to irrelevant peptides
(PVSKMRMATPLLMQA and QDLELSWNLNGLQADL) and labelled with PE.
Virtually no tetramer þCD4 þT cells were detected with the control tetramers.
Upon exclusion of unspecific binding, viable CD3 þCD4 þtetramer þT cells
were single-cell sorted for T-cell cloning experiments, expansion, testing of
antigen-specificity or used in further downstream assays.
HLA-DQ8-binding assay. Competitive binding assays were carried out according
to previously established procedures30,67,68: HLA-DQ8 monomers were kindly
provided by R.A.W. from the NIH Tetramer Core Facility (Atlanta, USA). The
CLIP peptide of HLA-DQ8 molecules was cleaved off by incubation with thrombin
(Novagen) for 2 h (ref. 69).
Specifically, a FITC-labelled GAD65 253-265R255F peptide (IAFFKMFPEVKEK)
was used as an indicator peptide (10 mM) for the binding reaction together with
thrombin-cleaved HLA-DQ8 monomers (0.4 mM) and increasing concentrations of
competitor peptides (natural insulin B:9-23, ins.mim.1,2,3,4, MP185-204). The
MP185-204 peptide (TAKAMEQMAGSSEQAAEAME) was used as a positive
DQ8-binding control. The indicator peptide incubated with DQ8 monomers in the
absence of competitor peptide was used as positive control. For background analysis
the binding reaction was performed without HLA-DQ8 monomers. The binding
reaction was incubated for 48h at 37 �C. Assays were then captured using anti-DQ
antibody-coated plates (SPV-L3, Abcam, 15 mg ml� 1). Detection was performed
using anti-FITC HRP (Abcam, 1:1,000) antibodies in combination with TMB
substrate (BD Biosciences) and subsequent analysis with the Epoch plate reader
(Biotech) at 450 and 405 nm.
Binding curves were fitted by nonlinear regression using log transformed x
values (x ¼ test peptide concentration) with the one-site competitive binding model
to extract IC50 values (Prism software, v.6.04, GraphPad Software).
Generation of artificial antigen-presenting cells. Earlier studies had shown
that an indirect coating of fluorescently unlabelled HLA-peptide tetramers on
beads via an anti-MHCII antibody provides specific and efficient stimulation of
antigen-specific CD4 þ T cells34. Therefore, we first coated anti-HLA-DQ
antibodies (SPV-L3, Abcam) to antibody-coupling beads (Dynabeads Antibody
Coupling Kit, Life Technologies) at 20 mg mg � 1 beads followed by coupling with
unlabelled HLA-DQ8-tetramers (3 mg per 10 � 106 beads) to the DQ-antibodies.
Artificial APCs (aAPCs) using the above described control tetramers were
generated accordingly. For stimulation aAPCs were used at a concentration of
230 mg ml � 1 corresponding to a tetramer concentration of 5 mg ml � 1.
CFSE-T-cell proliferation assays. CD4 þCD25-T cells were labelled with CFSE
and incubated with propagated APCs loaded with medium alone, various doses of
insulin B:9-23 peptide, or with a titration of various strong-agonistic insulin
mimetopes (as described above) for 5 days. In all assays, each condition was per-
formed in triplicate wells. Cells were cultured in X-Vivo15 Medium supplemented
with 2 mM glutamine, penicillin (50 U ml� 1), streptomycin (50 mg ml� 1) and 5%
heat-inactivated human AB serum (Invitrogen) in round bottom 96-well plates.
After 5 days, the cell cultures were stained for CD4, CD3, CD25 and CD45RO and
processed for FACS analyses. Responsiveness was measured by the presence and
quantity of CD4 þCD25 þCFSEdimT cells identified by FACS.
Generation of insulin-specific T-cell clones. To perform further phenotyping of
insulin-specific CD4 þT cells and to generate specific T-cell clones 500.000
CFSE-labelled CD4 þT cells were cultured in the presence of insulin-specific
aAPCs or control aAPCs generated as described above for 7 days. At day 7 the cells
were analysed and a single viable CFSEdimCD4 þT cell was sorted into each well of
a 96-well plate in the presence of 200 ml of X-Vivo15 medium and 1 � 104 PBMCs
of a HLA-DQ8 � donor, 1 � 104 PBMCs of a HLA-DQ8 þ donor as well as 1 � 104
HLA-DQ8 þ EBV-transformed B cells (Riken Cell Bank, Japan). Feeder cells were
irradiated with 40 Gy (PBMCs) or 50 Gy (B cells) before addition to the cultures.
Cells were stimulated with 30 ng ml � 1 anti-CD3 (OKT3, BioLegend) in the
presence of IL-2 (Peprotech, 20 U ml � 1) and IL-4 (Peprotech, 10 ng ml � 1).
Expansion of specific clones was performed by addition of IL-15 (Peprotech,
10 ng ml � 1) and IL-21 (Peprotech, 10 ng ml � 1) as well as low-dose IL-7
(Peprotech, 0.1 ng ml � 1). For expansion of growing clones cells were splitted into
48-well plates after 2 weeks. Clones were re-tested for antigen-specificity and
DQ-restriction by stimulation with natural insulin-peptides or -mimetopes
(0.1–10 mg ml � 1) in the presence or absence of HLA-DQ blocking antibodies
(SPV-L3, Abcam, 10 mg ml � 1) and analysis of total CD25 upregulation and
CD25 þ þ þ levels after 48 h of stimulation was assessed by FACS analyses.
Analysis of stimulatory potential of insulin mimetopes. Proliferative responses
of HLA-DQ8-restricted insulin-specific CFSE-labelled CD4 þT-cell clones were
defined using a titration of individual insulin mimetopes and the natural insulin
epitope B:9-23 presented by irradiated T cell depleted PBMCs. Subsequent FACS
analyses of CFSEdimCD25 þCD4 þT cells were performed as described above. The
stimulatory capacity of the insulin mimetopes was assessed as fold of stimulatory
capacity of the natural insulin B:9-23 epitope.
Human Treg induction using limited TCR-stimulation in vitro. For polyclonal
Treg induction, human naive CD4 þT cells were defined as CD3 þ, CD4 þ,
CD45RA þ, CD45RO �, CD127 þ, CD25 �, HLA-DR � and sorted with the BD
FACSAria III for purity (see Supplementary Fig. 6). CD4 þT cells were cultured for
12 h in a 96-well plate pre-coated with 5 mg ml � 1 anti-CD3 (UCHT1, BioLegend)
and 5 mg ml � 1 anti-CD28 (CD28.2, BioLegend) and 100 U ml � 1 IL-2 (Peprotech).
Limited TCR stimulation was achieved by pipetting the cells into new, uncoated
wells, after 12 h, where they were cultured for additional 36 h without further TCR
stimulation. To assess Treg induction using continuous TCR stimulation naive
CD4 þT cells were stimulated in pre-coated wells as described above for a time
period of 54 h and analysed accordingly. For antigen-specific Treg induction,
human naive CD4 þT cells were defined as CD3 þ, CD4 þ, CD45RA þ,
CD45RO �, CD127 þ, CD25-, HLA-DR � and sorted with the BD FACSAria III
for purity. Naive CD4 þT cells were co-cultured with autologous CFSE-labelled
DCs isolated as described above in the presence of insulin mimetopes, natural
insulin B:9-23 epitope (0.001 and 0.01 ng ml � 1). After 12 h APCs were removed by
sorting CD4 þT cells as CFSE � followed by a culture for additional 36 h in new
wells without further peptide stimulation.
Restimulation cultures. Upon Treg induction using limited or continuous
TCR-stimulation in vitro sort-purification of CD127lowCD25highCD4 þ Tregs was
performed. The Tregs were then stimulated for 36 h in the presence 5 mg ml � 1
anti-CD3 (UCHT1, BioLegend) and 5 mg ml � 1 anti-CD28 (CD28.2, BioLegend)
antibodies without addition of TGFb followed by the analysis of CD25, CD127 and
Foxp3 by intracellular staining and FACS as described above.
Treg suppression assay in vitro. Tregs were sort-purified as CD4 þCD3 þ
CD127lowCD25highT cells. In control experiments Treg identity of CD4 þCD3 þ
CD127lowCD25high T cells was confirmed by intracellular staining for Foxp3.
Conventional T cells were sorted as CD4 þCD3 þCD127 þCD25 �. Tregs were
purified from spleens and lymph nodes of humanized mice and first expanded for
six days by polyclonal stimulation with anti-CD3 (UCHT1, BioLegend) and
anti-CD28 (CD28.2, BioLegend ) at 1 mg ml � 1 each in the presence of IL-2
(Peprotech, 500 U ml � 1) and 20 � 104 irradiated CD4 � feeder cells (CD4-
depleted PBMCs and EBV-transformed B cells). On day six Tregs and conventional
T cells were sort-purified to remove the remaining feeder cells and conventional
T cells (responder cells) were labelled with CFSE (0.25 mM). Conventional T cells
were expanded accordingly at 50 U ml � 1 Il-2. Treg cells and conventional T cells
were rested for 16 h in the absence of IL-2 to force them into synchronous resting
states44. Labelled responder T cells were cultured with or without Tregs (responder:
Tregs 1:2; 1:4 and 1:8) for 3 days in the presence of stimulation with anti-CD3
(UCHT1, BioLegend) and anti-CD28 (CD28.2, BioLegend) (1 mg ml � 1 each).
Analyses were performed on day three on a FACSAria III and suppression of
responder cell proliferation was assessed by determining the dilution of their CFSE

 label. Suppression of responder cell proliferation is shown in % suppression of the
proliferation of the responder cells alone44.
For insulin-specific suppression assays, induced Tregs from humanized mice
were sort-purified as indicated above. Cells of insulin-specific T-cell clones were
used as effector cells labelled with CFSE as described above and co-cultured with
induced human Tregs. The cells were stimulated either with insulin mimetopes
(100 ng ml � 1) or the natural insulin B:9-23 epitope (10 mg ml � 1).
Additional experiments were performed using effector T cells from T1D
individuals and polyclonal stimulation as outlined above.
Engraftment of NSG mice with human haematopoietic stem cells. Two-week-
old NSG-HLA-DQ8 mice were reconstituted with at least 5 � 104 CD34 þHSCs
from an HLA-DQ8 þ donor per mouse by intravenous injection in 50 ml PBS into
the retro orbital sinus without prior conditioning by irradiation or busulfan
treatment. To avoid sex incompatibilities the sex of the NSG-HLA-DQ8 mice for
reconstitution was chosen in accordance with the cord blood donor.
Assessment of reconstitution efficacy in NSG-HLA-DQ8 mice. NSG-DQ8 mice
were bled 5 and 8 weeks post engraftment and peripheral blood was analysed
by FACS to characterize the engraftment of the human immune system using
fluorescently labelled-specific human versus murine CD45 antibodies.
Analyses of reconstituted humanized NSG-HLA-DQ8 mice. At various time
points after reconstitution humanized NSG-HLA-DQ8 mice were euthanized and
whole blood, peripheral lymph nodes, spleen and WAT were analysed for the
presence of CD4 þT cells. CD4 þT cells were extracted from WAT by collagenase
II (Sigma Aldrich, 4 mg ml � 1) digestion and peripheral lymph nodes were
homogenized by gentle grinding through a cell strainer followed by cellular FACS
stainings and analyses as described above.
Human in vivo Treg induction in humanized mice. Humanized NSG-HLA-DQ8
mice at 20 weeks post reconstitution were then subjected to in vivo Treg induction
assays using insulin mimetope peptide infusion by subcutaneous implantation of
osmotic mini-pumps, which permit the continuous delivery of minute amounts of
peptide for 14 days 15,17. Mice were infused with a combination of ins.mim.1 ¼ 14E-
21G-22E and ins.mim.4 ¼ 14E-21E-22E at 5 mg day � 1. Control animals were infused
with PBS. Successfully reconstituted animals were randomized to test groups for
antigen-specific Treg induction. No animals were excluded due to illness or outlier
results; therefore, no exclusion determination was required. For ex vivo T cell
analyses, the entire group of mice treated with PBS or the insulin mimetopes was
analysed. After 3 weeks, Foxp3 þTreg induction was assessed upon insulin-specific
tetramer stainings as described above and Tregs were identified based on
CD4 þCD3 þCD127lowCD25 þ. Treg identity was verified by intracellular staining
for Foxp3 and by analyses of Foxp3 mRNA abundance.
Analysis of Treg signature genes. T cells were sort-purified; cDNA synthesis and
subsequent amplification were performed using the SMARTer ultra-low input RNA
Kit for sequencing—v3 (Takara Clontech) according to the manufacturer
´s instruc-
tions. cDNA was purified using Agencourt AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter).
qPCR was performed on a CFX96 real time system (BioRad) using QuantiTect
Primer assays (Qiagen) for Foxp3, CTLA4, Il2-Ra, TIGIT, RTKN2, IKZF2, ENTPD1
and FCRL3 and SsoFast Evagreen Supermix (BioRad). Levels of Histone 3 and 18s
were used to normalize target gene expression levels (Histone: H3F3A BT020962,
primers: fwd: 50-ACTGGCTACAAAAGCCGCTC-30; rev: 50-ACTTGCCTCCTGC
AAAGCAC-30; 18s: QuantiTect Primer assay, Qiagen).
Analysis of T-cell effector genes. T cell effector genes were analysed on the same
cDNA samples used for Treg signature gene analysis described above. qPCR was
performed on a CFX96 real time system (BioRad) using QuantiTect Primer assays
(Qiagen) for IL17-Ra, NFATc2, IL-21, RORgt, T-bet and IFNg and SsoFast
Evagreen Supermix (BioRad). Levels of Histone 3 and 18s were used to normalize
target gene expression abundance (Histone: H3F3A BT020962, primers: fwd:
50-ACTGGCTACAAAAGCCGCTC-30, rev: 50-ACTTGCCTCCTGCAAAGC
AC-30; 18 s: QuantiTect Primer assay, Qiagen).
HLA fast genotyping. HLA-genotyping of the children was available. Fast geno-
typing was used for cord blood experiments and a protocol was developed on the
basis of Nguyen et al.70. In brief, DNA was extracted from whole blood using the
Quick-gDNA MiniPrep Kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. For qPCR analyses SsoAdvance Universal Probes Supermix (BioRad) was
used with 15 ng of gDNA, 250 nM forward and reverse primer and 500 nM of
Probes FAM and HEX. Standards were added for subsequent analysis with Bio-Rad

DNA bisulfite conversion and methylation analysis. Because of the reduced
nature of available sample material, FACS-sorted CD4 þT cells (50–2,000 cells)
were subjected to a combined sample lysis and bisulfite conversion using the
EpiTect Plus LyseAll Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) or the EZ DNA
Methylation-Direct Kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. For bias-controlled quantitative methylation analysis, a combination
of MS-HRM and subsequent Pyrosequencing was performed as described
earlier42,43. Utilizing the PyroMark Assay Design Software 2.0 (Qiagen), PCR
primers (human forward: 50-AAGTTGAATGGGGGATGTTTTTGGGATA
TAGATTATG-30; human reverse: 50-CTACCACATCCACCAACACCCATA
TCACC-30; annealing-temperature: 62 �C; murine forward: 50-TTGGGTTTTGTT
GTTATAATTTGAATTTGG-30; murine reverse: 50-ACCTACCTAATACTCACC
AAACATC-30; annealing-temperature: 60 �C) and the according sequencing
primer (human: 50-TAGTTTTAGATTTGTTTAGATTTT-30; murine: 50-AATTT
GAATTTGGTTAGATTTTT-30) were designed to cover the area of differential
methylation in the first Foxp3 intron initially reported by Baron et al.42
(Supplementary Fig. 14). Pyrosequencing data are presented as means of all
CpG-sites analysed due to high homology between methylation levels of the
individual sites (Supplementary Fig. 14).
Statistics. Results are presented as mean and s.e.m. or as percentages, where
appropriate. For normally distributed data, Student’s t-test for unpaired values was
used to compare means between independent groups and the Student’s t-test for
paired values was used to compare values for the same sample or subject tested
under different conditions. The non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-ranks test was
applied when data did not show Gaussian distribution. Group size estimations were
based upon a power calculation to minimally yield an 80% chance to detect a
significant difference in the respective parameter of Po0.05 between the relevant
groups. For all tests, a two-tailed P value of o0.05 was considered to be significant.
Statistical significance is shown as * ¼ Po0.05; ** ¼ Po0.01; *** ¼ Po0.001, or
not significant (ns) P4 0.05. Analyses were performed using the programs
GraphPad Prism 6 (La Jolla, CA) and the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
(SPSS 19.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).

Author contributions
I.S. performed ex vivo, in vitro and in vivo experiments for the characterization of
human insulin mimetopes and their impact on Treg induction versus T-cell proliferation
and -activation, analysed and interpreted data and wrote the manuscript. R.W.F.
supported and performed ex vivo analyses to assess Treg stability, analysed and
interpreted the data. P.A. coordinated islet autoantibody measurements and patient
phenotyping. M.G.S. performed ex vivo and in vitro analyses on Treg induction
and -stability, analysed and interpreted the data. F.G. performed ex vivo and in vitro
analyses on insulin-specific T cells, -Tregs and -induction. F.H. coordinated the clinical
study centre and patient visits. E.-M.S. designed the HLA-fast genotyping assay.
A.K. prospectively followed patients and families and coordinated study visits and venous
blood collection. L.S. provided NSG-HLA-DQ8 mice and supported analyses on
humanized mice. R.A.W. conceptualized, designed and produced HLA-DQ8-restricted
insulin-specific tetramer reagents. A.-G.Z. advised and co-conceptualized the study
design, and is PI of the cohort studies BABYDIAB, DiMelli and the Munich Bioresource,
which provided islet autoantibody positive and negative children for the study. C.D.
conceptualized, designed, performed in vivo experiments with humanized mice, analysed
and interpreted all studies and wrote the manuscript.
