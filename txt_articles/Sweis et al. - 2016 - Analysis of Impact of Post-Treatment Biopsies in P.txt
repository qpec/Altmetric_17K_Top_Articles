Purpose
The use of biopsy-derived pharmacodynamic biomarkers is increasing in early-phase clinical trials.
It remains unknown whether drug development is accelerated or enhanced by their use. We
examined the impact of biopsy-derived pharmacodynamic biomarkers on subsequent drug
development through a comprehensive analysis of phase I oncology studies from 2003 to 2010 and
subsequent publications citing the original trials.
Methods
We conducted a search to identify and examine publications of phase I oncology studies including
the use of biopsy-derived pharmacodynamic biomarkers between 2003 and 2010. Characteristics of
those studies were extracted and analyzed, along with outcomes from the biomarker data. We then
compiled and reviewed publications of subsequent phase II and III trials citing the original phase I
biomarker studies to determine the impact on drug development.
Results
We identified 4,840 phase I oncology publications between 2003 and 2010. Seventy-two studies
included a biopsy-derived pharmacodynamic biomarker. The proportion of biomarker studies
including nondiagnostic biopsies increased over time (P = .002). A minimum of 1,873 tumor biopsies
were documented in the 72 studies, 12 of which reported a statistically significant biomarker result.
Thirty-three percent of studies (n = 24) were referenced by subsequent publications specifically with
regard to the biomarkers. Only five positive biomarker studies were cited subsequently, and
maximum tolerated dose was used for subsequent drug development in all cases.
Conclusion
Despite their increased use, the impact of biopsy-derived pharmacodynamic biomarkers in phase I
oncology studies on subsequent drug development remains uncertain. No impact on subsequent
dose or schedule was demonstrated. This issue requires further evaluation, given the risk and cost
of such studies.

INTRODUCTION
The era of molecularly targeted antineoplastic
therapies has been accompanied by a corre-
sponding surge in phase I clinical trials.1 Many of
these trials include nondiagnostic biopsies
intended to elucidate biologic effects in response
to pharmacologic interventions. The arguments
supporting such studies are that they yield proof
of mechanism and define the optimal biologic
dose. There has been optimism that using biopsy-
derived pharmacodynamic biomarkers for these
purposes will accelerate drug development while
minimizing the risk of toxicities.2,3 As a result, the
proportion of phase I studies with biomarkers has
increased steadily from 1990 to 2007.4,5 The
aforementioned benefits have been cited as
driving factors for the increased use of biopsy-
derived biomarkers in early-phase clinical trials.
Despite the increased use of biomarkers, a
paucity of data demonstrating a beneficial impact
on drug development exists. Phase I pharmaco-
dynamic studies rarely inform subsequent phase
II dosing, which remains driven by toxicity, that
is, maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Only 13%
of phase I studies with biomarkers from 1991
to 2002 reported pharmacodynamic data that
affected the phase II drug dose.5 Moreover, the
proportion of phase II trials shaped by phase I
pharmacodynamic data may also be inflated by
publication bias. A recent study on early-phase

 clinical trials with biopsy-derived pharmacodynamic biomarkers
revealed that 22% were never published after abstract pre-
sentation.6 Of those that were published, pharmacodynamic data
were frequently absent (23%) or incomplete (30%).
Nondiagnostic tissue collection is associated with significant
costs and potentially deters patients from enrollment in early-
phase clinical trials. The per-patient cost for an additional bio-
marker endpoint in a trial was estimated to be $6,675 in 2004.7 In
addition, 36% of cancer patients in one survey stated that man-
datory research-related biopsies would deter them from enrolling
in a clinical trial.8 In the same study, 42% of patients believed that a
nondiagnostic biopsy would influence their health and care, even
when they were clearly informed that it was for research purposes
only. These data indicate that cancer patients often misinterpret the
risk-benefit profile of biopsies in early-phase clinical trials.
Given these concerns, it is critical to understand with precision
the potential benefits of such studies. Thus, we aimed to ascertain
the impact of biopsy-derived pharmacodynamic biomarkers on
subsequent drug development. We systematically identified phase I
oncology clinical trials that used cancer biomarkers published from
2003 to 2010. We then compiled and analyzed subsequent phase II
and III studies citing those trials to quantify whether the results of
these studies informed subsequent drug development.
METHODS
We identified published phase I oncology studies that involved the pro-
curement of an additional invasive, nondiagnostic, post-treatment tumor
biopsy for pharmacodynamic biomarkers over an 8-year period between
2003 and 2010.
Study Design
Publications of phase I clinical trials in oncology that incorporated a
biomarker were identified by searching PubMed using a broad search
algorithm. As an initial screen, a query was conducted using the National
Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings terms antineoplastic agent;
clinical trial, phase I; and neoplasms, as well as the text term oncology.
Studies incorporating a post-treatment biopsy were identified through
manual review. Results were limited to phase I clinical trials over an 8-year
period, from 2003 to 2010. The 2010 cutoff allowed adequate time for
publication of subsequent trials citing the phase I trial. Duplications were
removed, and data were exported for further analysis.
Identification of Biopsy-Derived Biomarker Studies
To extract phase I trials in oncology incorporating post-treatment
tumor biopsies, we further refined the data set by conducting a text search
of full abstracts. We compiled studies that included the terms biomarker,
pharmacodynamic, surrogate, or biopsy. The target population for this
analysis was adult patients with solid tumors receiving oral or intravenous
systemic antineoplastic therapies. Therefore, articles covering pediatric
populations, hematologic malignancies, topical/local therapies, gene
therapy, immunotherapy, or radiation therapy were excluded. Articles on
phase 0 trials were also excluded, as were review articles and editorial
publications. The remaining articles were downloaded, and one of the
authors (R.F.S) manually reviewed each full text for the presence or
absence of an additional nondiagnostic post-treatment invasive tumor
biopsy. Studies with urine, peripheral blood, imaging, or normal tissue
biopsies were collected but were not further analyzed for this study. Studies
including post-treatment biopsies for pharmacodynamic biomarkers were
then reviewed by at least two of the three authors.
Data Abstraction
We developed an article abstraction form that included three broad
domains: study characteristics, biomarker features and results, and citing
article data. The first domain included descriptive characteristics of each
study, including article year (time of indexing), funding source, study
location, and drug category (cytotoxic chemotherapy, small molecule,
biologic, or natural product/extract).
Next, we abstracted biomarker features and results. We noted the
number of different biomarker modalities, such as peripheral blood draw,
tumor biopsy, normal tissue biopsy, urine collection, or imaging. We then
focused on tumor biopsies and assessed several performance metrics.
Biomarker test reproducibility was the first characteristic assessed. Con-
sideration of interpatient or intrapatient variability, standard error,
population-based validation, test duplication for reproducibility, or quality
control was considered positive. If a reference to a citation with relevant
information on the assay was provided, that article was then reviewed and
assessed for the same measures. The use of appropriate positive and
negative controls alone was not considered sufficient to account for
reproducibility.
The second characteristic analyzed was the presence or absence of a
prespecified statistical plan. Description of a power analysis or comment
on the expected number of patients necessary to detect a significant result
in the context of a biomarker was considered positive. A prespecified plan
regarding traditional phase 1 endpoints (toxicity or efficacy) without
consideration of the biomarker was not considered positive. A description
of post hoc statistics used to characterize groups alone was not considered
sufficient. Next, we noted the number of laboratory tests per biopsy sample
and determined whether multiple comparison testing was addressed in the
Methods section, such as the application of a Bonferroni correction or the
use of a more stringent P value. The results and conclusions were then
reviewed for reporting of a statistically significant result. If present, we
noted whether a correction for multiple comparisons was mentioned.
Finally, we assessed whether the article included a conclusion regarding the
biomarker and whether the authors suggested that the biomarker data
would affect future studies.
Lastly, we used PubMed and Google Scholar to compile articles citing
the original phase I trials. For each study, the resulting list was filtered to
include only phase II or III studies to assess the impact of the biomarker on
subsequent drug development. We then noted the total number of studies
that referenced each biomarker. Those articles were characterized by the
context of the biomarker reference (mechanism of action, recommended
drug dose/schedule, or both).
Statistics
Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the studies. We used one-
way analysis of variance or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate, to evaluate the
significance of relationships between study characteristics and biomarker-
specific outcome. The Cochran-Armitage test was used to assess linear
trends over time. All statistical analyses were carried out using JMP
software (version 11.1.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Significance was defined
as P , .05 for all tests.
RESULTS
Data Sample
We identified 4,840 publications between 2003 and 2010 that
met initial screening criteria for phase I oncology trials (Fig 1).
Abstract keyword analysis narrowed those results to 584 studies
that included biomarkers, which were manually reviewed by one of
the authors (R.F.S.). Seventy-two studies included post-treatment,
nondiagnostic invasive tumor biopsies and were included in our
final analysis (Data Supplement).

 Characteristics of Biopsy-Derived Biomarker Studies
The characteristics of the 72 phase I studies that included
nondiagnostic biopsies are shown in Table 1. The proportion of
biomarker studies that included nondiagnostic biopsies increased
over time (P = .002, Fig 2A). The median number of biopsies per
study was 16, with a range of 2 to 149 (Fig 2B). A total of 1,873
tumor biopsies were documented within the 72 studies. This total
is underestimated, because 14 studies had additional biopsies not
explicitly quantified within the text of the publication or sup-
plementary materials. The number of different tests/assays per-
formed per biopsy ranged from one to 21, with a median of three.
The majority of studies with biopsy-derived biomarkers (71%,
n = 51) also included biomarkers derived from other modalities
(peripheral blood draw, normal tissue biopsy, urine collection, or
imaging).
Methodology and Impact of Biopsy-Derived Biomarker
Studies
Methods of biopsy-based biomarker assays were reviewed for
each study and characterized by predefined performance metrics
and impact on drug development (Table 1). A minority of studies
included a description of biopsy test characteristics, such as
reproducibility, assay validation, or standard error. Although the
vast majority of studies tested multiple biomarkers, few described
a correction for multiple testing in the methods. No study included
a prespecified statistical plan or power analysis in reference to
hypothesized biomarker outcomes. The vast majority of studies
made conclusions regarding the biomarker results, but only a
minority suggested that the biomarker results would affect sub-
sequent drug development. Although most studies were cited by at
least one subsequent phase II or III publication, the citing studies
inconsistently mentioned the prior biomarker results.
Characterization of Studies With a Positive Biomarker
Result
A statistically significant biomarker result was reported in
17% of studies (n = 12). These studies were deemed “positive
biomarker studies” and were further analyzed by compiling and
reviewing the citing phase II and III studies. From 2003 to 2007,
the proportion of publications that were considered positive
biomarker studies increased from 0% to 37% (P = .006 for trend).
Positive biomarker studies were more likely to have assay char-
acteristics defined in the methods (P = .02) and a higher number of
biopsies (median, 32 v 15, P = .01). The mean number of tests
performed per biopsy was 3.4. No positive biomarker studies
included correction for multiple testing. Only five positive bio-
marker studies were cited by subsequent phase II or phase III
trial publications in regard to the biomarker (range, 1-10 citing
publications per study).
Final Assessment of Overall Impact
To assess the overall impact of including biopsy-derived
biomarkers in phase I oncology trials, we focused on the five
positive biomarker studies that were cited by subsequent phase II
or III trial publications (Table 2). General impact was first assessed
through quantification of citations. Three of the studies (60%)
were cited exclusively by a single phase II article published by the
same authors. The remaining two studies by Baselga et al and
Tabernero et al were cited by unaffiliated investigators and were
cited more frequently (cited by three and 10 phase II or III studies,
respectively).
Subsequent publications were then reviewed for context in
regard to biomarker reference. In all citing phase II or III pub-
lications, the biomarker was considered to have validated the
biologic mechanism of action or confirmed the desired targeted

 molecular effect. Furthermore, in each study, a comment was made
referencing biologic activity at the selected dose or schedule of
drug. However, MTD was still used for dose selection in all cases,
including the two most frequently cited articles.
DISCUSSION
The addition of biopsy-derived biomarkers to phase I oncology
trials appears to have low yield in enhancing drug development.
Over an 8-year period in which 72 studies were conducted with at
least 1,873 nondiagnostic biopsies, only five studies resulted in a
statistically significant biomarker result that was cited in sub-
sequent publications. Furthermore, only two studies were cited
independently (ie, by other research groups).
Our formal analysis confirms that the use of biomarkers,
including those that are biopsy derived, is increasing over time.
Only three studies were identified with biopsy-derived biomarkers
from 2003, the first year analyzed, compared with 19 from 2010,
the final year included in this analysis. Furthermore, the references
to biopsy-derived biomarkers only confirmed expected target
activation and did not actually affect dose selection or go/no-go
decision making. Taken together, these findings call into question
the increasing use of such biomarkers in phase I studies without
concomitant improvement in the design of such studies.
It is important to highlight our finding that a statistically
significant biomarker result was more likely to occur in a study
with assay characteristics clearly delineated. This result is logical
and appears consistent with prior observations. The clinical
application of biomarkers is complex and requires both scientific
and technical validation.9 When designing such trials in the future,
the use of validated assays and carefully designed measures of
pharmacodynamic effect are likely to maximize the potentially
derived knowledge value. This output is critical as the sole measure
that can be weighed against the risks and costs of nondiagnostic
invasive biopsies.
The most heavily cited biomarker study was by Tabernero et al
and involved the drug everolimus. This publication included a
thorough description of assay validation, blinding during assess-
ment, appropriate positive and negative controls, and statistics.10

 A clear demonstration of drug activity was shown through biomarkers
in this study. Interestingly, an accompanying editorial by Sleijfer and
Wiemer still concluded that “there are too many uncertainties to solely
rely on biomarkers for dose selection.”11(p1577) This point was reiterated
in one of the citing articles by Ellard et al, who stated that “maximum-
tolerated dose remains an important end point and cannot be
supplanted with predictions of effective biologic dose.”12(p4539)
Nonetheless, this phase I study highlighted the appropriate con-
sideration of numerous factors of pharmacodynamic biomarker
trial design that have been previously recommended.2,13 Con-
sideration of such features should be incorporated into guidelines
for the design of phase I studies involving biomarkers.
Biomarker studies have been used after a drug has been
successfully developed to explore the impact of changes in dose or
schedule, as with cetuximab.14,15 Those studies used paired skin
biopsies, not tumor biopsies, exemplifying the complexity of
identifying an optimal dose of a relatively nontoxic monoclonal
antibody. Alternatively, randomized dose-ranging studies using
tumor size as an endpoint can also be used in this context.16
Given our findings, we recommend that the use of invasive
biopsies for the purpose of pharmacodynamics be limited to those
clinical trials in which the primary objective is to ascertain the
effect of the drug(s) on the biomarker. This may be particularly
relevant when there is uncertainty as to whether to proceed to
phase II development (ie, a pivotal biomarker study). In this
context, one needs to be rigorous in the design, ideally incorpo-
rating randomization to accurately measure the effect of the drug
treatment on the biomarker. For example, patients can be ran-
domly assigned to either two pretreatment biopsies or one pre-
treatment and one post-treatment biopsy after the MTD is reached.
With this design, any differences can be clearly attributed to the
drug. Such pivotal biomarker studies should have appropriate
power to detect an effect of pharmacologic significance. Given that
the intraindividual variability of the biomarker may be unknown,
the target sample size may need to be adjusted once this variability
is assessed (ie, in the control arm). Alternatively, patients can be
randomly assigned across a range of doses and/or schedules, ideally
using a single post-treatment biopsy (if the baseline assay varia-
bility is high and the post-treatment result is hypothesized to be
highly dependent on the pretreatment value, then two biopsies
should be used). Again, confidence in the assayed biomarker is
necessary, and the hypothesis should be clearly framed with a

Impact of Post-Treatment Biopsies in Phase I Trials
 statistical design appropriate for the impact of the question, given
the potential mortality of post-treatment tumor biopsies.17
Several limitations to our analysis existed. First, our data only
included studies published as full publications in journals indexed
through PubMed. Unpublished data could not be quantified or
assessed and may have affected our findings. However, this pub-
lication bias is more likely to overinflate the positive impact of
these studies, because negative results are less likely to be
published.6,18 Second, despite our attempt to identify all phase I
oncology trials with biomarkers, there is a possibility that some
were not captured by our search algorithm, despite its broad scope.
Similarly, our analysis specifically excluded studies involving
radiation and hematologic malignancies, which limited the
interpretation to phase I studies of solid tumors. Immunotherapy
studies were also excluded. Those studies involved vaccines,
cytokines, or adoptive cellular therapies, which warrant special
consideration, given that the target cellular effect is on the host
rather than on the tumor. Given recent advances in immune
checkpoint blockade, we did requery our dataset and found four
studies involving CTLA-4 or PD-1/PDL-1 targeted therapy. How-
ever, none of those studies included tumor biopsy-derived bio-
markers; therefore, no relevant data were missed. The analysis ended
in 2010, which was intentionally chosen to allow adequate time for
subsequent citation by phase II and III studies. These citation data
were critical to our final analysis of impact. To gauge the quantity of
uncaptured data from recent years, we screened studies from 2014
and found the number of biomarker studies to be only slightly
higher than that in 2010, the final year in our analysis (123 v 102,
respectively). Thus, it seems that a proportional number of addi-
tional studies would be added by including 4 more years. The
incremental addition of those studies to the analysis would be of low
benefit, given the previously mentioned limitations to identification
of citing studies.
Finally, even though dose and schedule do not seem to be
affected by biopsy-derived biomarkers, many of the citations
discussed confirmation of target engagement. Proof-of-concept
could potentially serve as a basis for continued development of a
drug class, when one particular drug may not show clinical activity.
Our study did not address this point because it is difficult, if not
impossible, to quantify the positive impact such knowledge of
biologic underpinnings might have on future drug development.
