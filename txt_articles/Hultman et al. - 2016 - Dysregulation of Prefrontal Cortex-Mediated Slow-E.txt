In Brief
The complex mechanisms whereby
multiple brain regions coordinate
emotion remain tenebrous. Hultman et al.
show that the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
directly regulates beta oscillatory
connectivity between multiple limbic
brain regions. Stress-induced disruption
of this PFC-dependent function yields
pathological emotional behavior.

SUMMARY
Circuits distributed across cortico-limbic brain re-
gions compose the networks that mediate emotional
behavior. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) regulates ultra-
slow (<1 Hz) dynamics across these networks, and
PFC dysfunction is implicated in stress-related ill-
nesses including major depressive disorder (MDD).
To uncover the mechanism whereby stress-induced
changes in PFC circuitry alter emotional networks
to yield pathology, we used a multi-disciplinary
approach including in vivo recordings in mice and
chronic social defeat stress. Our network model, in-
ferred using machine learning, linked stress-induced
behavioral pathology to the capacity of PFC to
synchronize amygdala and VTA activity. Direct stim-
ulation of PFC-amygdala circuitry with DREADDs
normalized
PFC-dependent limbic synchrony in
stress-susceptible animals and restored normal
behavior. In addition to providing insights into MDD
mechanisms, our findings demonstrate an interdisci-
plinary approach that can be used to identify the
large-scale network changes that underlie complex
emotional pathologies and the specific network
nodes that can be used to develop targeted interven-
tions.
INTRODUCTION
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a multifactorial mental disor-
der characterized by changes in mood, interests, sleep, and
perception. While many genes and cells have been implicated
in the onset and manifestation of depression, a concerted mech-
anism of causality has remained elusive, in part due to the het-
erogeneity of the disorder. Multiple human imaging studies
have implicated altered functional activation of the prefrontal
cortex (PFC) in MDD (Mayberg et al., 1999). Hyper-connectivity
(i.e., increased oscillatory synchrony) between PFC and the
default mode network has been directly linked to the duration
of depressive episodes (Greicius et al., 2007), and an increase
in the functional connectivity between PFC and both cognitive
and limbic affective networks has been described in depressed
subjects as well (Sheline et al., 2010). Finally, direct stimulation of
sub-regions of the PFC ameliorates MDD symptoms and related
behaviors in select clinical populations (George et al., 2010;
Mayberg et al., 2005) and in multiple preclinical models of the
disorder (Covington et al., 2010; Kumar et al., 2013). These find-
ings suggest that dysfunction within PFC-dependent networks
may serve as a pathophysiological mechanism underlying
MDD. Here, we employ a novel interdisciplinary approach to
test this hypothesis. Our goal was to test whether functional
changes in PFC-dependent networks directly contribute to
(rather than simply reflect) the global changes in limbic oscilla-
tory connectivity and the behavioral alterations that occur with
the disorder.
In humans, MDD can be triggered, exacerbated, or re-occur in
response to stress (Bartolomucci and Leopardi, 2009; Caspi
et al., 2003; Kendler et al., 1999; Tennant, 2002). Similarly, in
rodents, exposure to chronic social defeat stress induces a
syndrome that recapitulates many phenotypes of MDD (Golden
et al., 2011; Krishnan et al., 2007). In this paradigm, animals
are repeatedly exposed to larger aggressive animals for 10–
15 consecutive days. At the end of this protocol, animals
exhibit multiple depressive endophenotypes including hedonic
dysfunction, circadian dysregulation, anxiety, and psychomotor
retardation during the forced swim test (Krishnan et al., 2007;
Warren et al., 2013). Furthermore, phenotypic responses to the

 paradigm are sensitive to multiple distinct treatments that
ameliorate symptoms in MDD and bipolar depression in humans.
These treatments include cortical brain stimulation (Covington
et al., 2010; Kumar et al., 2013), tricyclic antidepressants (Berton
et al., 2006), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (Berton et al.,
2006), ketamine (Donahue et al., 2014), and anticonvulsants
(Berton et al., 2006). Now, we have clarified the role of PFC-
dependent circuitry in mediating MDD-related behavioral and
network phenotypes using the rodent model.
To directly probe the relationship between PFC circuitry,
limbic network oscillatory dysfunction, and the emergence of
depression-related behavior, we used the following systematic
approach. First, we implanted mice with microwire recording
electrodes in PFC and three relevant limbic brain regions impli-
cated in MDD: nucleus accumbens (NAc), amygdala (AMY),

(E) Using LFP data obtained during the second half of

limbic regions. We then introduced step-wise tem-
poral shifts between PFC oscillations and the other
LFPs. Finally, we re-calculated the phase synchrony
between these two regions and extracted the direc-
tionality based on the optimal time offset at which
each brain region synchronized with PFC for each
frequency. Data are shown as the 95% confidence
intervals (N = 33 mice). PFC activity preceded all
three of the other regions in 2–7 Hz band (red high-
light), and AMY activity in the 14–23 Hz band.
(F) To confirm that PFC and AMY exhibited direc-
tionality in the beta frequency range (14–23 Hz), we
calculated LFP phase coherence at various temporal
offsets in a second cohort of animals implanted with
wires in PFC and AMY (N = 46 mice; data show 95%
confidence interval).

frequencies at which the PFC influenced
neural activity in the other limbic regions,
and these oscillatory signals were selected
as the input parameters for our neural
network model of depression. Next, we

tory input parameters (Figure 1; see also Figure S1, available
online) and then inferred a network model of depression that
describes the relationship between the observed behavior and
circuit physiology using supervised machine learning. Finally,
we validated the ‘‘depression’’ network by directly stimulating
a key node at the intersection of PFC and AMY circuitry in chron-
ically stressed susceptible mice. Importantly, rather than intro-
ducing artificial circuit activity, this network manipulation
restored normal biological network oscillatory activity (i.e., mir-
roring the brain state of the unstressed and resilient animals)
and behavioral function. The findings generated using this
approach provided evidence that stress-induced dysregulation
of PFC-AMY circuitry disrupts the PFC-dependent synchroniza-
tion of ultraslow limbic activity. Furthermore, this dysregulation

 plays a key role in the manifestation of emotional behavior pa-
thology in MDD.
RESULTS
PFC Delta and Beta Activity Influence Limbic
Oscillations
To identify neural circuit components underlying susceptibility,
we implanted 33 animals with microwire electrodes (Figure 1B):
19 of these mice were subjected to chronic social defeat stress,
and 14 mice were used as non-stressed behavioral controls. The
most established behavioral assay for measuring the impact of
chronic social defeat stress in mice is the single-chamber social
interaction test (hereafter referred to as the ‘‘choice interaction
test’’) (Golden et al., 2011). In this assay, the interaction ratio is
defined as the total time an animal remains proximal to a CD1-
strain mouse in a small chamber divided by the time spent prox-
imal to that same chamber when it is empty. The interaction ratio
has been validated as a behavioral measure of susceptibility or
resilience to chronic social defeat, with susceptible mice exhib-
iting interaction ratios less than one (Krishnan et al., 2007). As ex-
pected, implanted mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress
exhibited lower interaction ratios during the choice interaction
test compared to control animals (p = 0.03 using rank-sum
test; Figure 1C). Furthermore, both susceptible and resilient an-
imals were identified in the stressed group of implanted mice
(Figure 1C). Together, these results confirmed that mice im-
planted with recording electrodes continue to show normal
behavioral responses to chronic stress. To discover the neural
network state that accompanied stress susceptibility, we directly
measured the impact of CD1 exposure on LFP activity in chron-
ically stressed mice using the FIT assay (Figure 1A). Critically,
this assay allows for the direct quantification of circuit responses
to an aggressor mouse without the influence of the exploratory or
escape behaviors exhibited during the choice interaction test
(Kumar et al., 2014).
Given that dysregulation of PFC-dependent circuits has been
implicated in contributing to MDD, we focused on PFC as the
seed region to perform functional connectivity analysis. We
initially sought to define which oscillatory frequency bands to
investigate by determining those that were PFC driven. We
took advantage of prior studies that suggest that directional in-
teractions across brain circuits can be extracted from phase re-
lationships between concurrently recorded LFP signals (Dzirasa
et al., 2013; Narayanan et al., 2011). We found that AMY, NAc,
and VTA oscillatory activities were particularly influenced by
PFC within the delta (2–7 Hz) range (Figures 1D–1F) during expo-
sure to the CD1 mouse. Beta (14–23 Hz) activity in the AMY was
sensitive to PFC input as well (Figures 1E and 1F). Thus, PFC ac-
tivity influenced limbic delta and beta oscillations, suggesting
that PFC delta and beta oscillations could be used as the seed
for our functional connectivity analysis.
PFC Synchronizes Slow-Evolving Limbic Beta Dynamics
Next, we probed the relationship between PFC oscillations
within these PFC-leading frequency bands (delta and beta) and
LFP activity measured across the limbic regions. LFP power re-
flects global activity patterns within a given brain region, while
LFP coherence quantifies the extent to which two distinct brain
regions oscillate together across time. As such, LFP coherence
reflects brain circuit activity (Igarashi et al., 2014; Jones and
Wilson, 2005). To quantify activity across the cortico-limbic
network, we calculated LFP power within each of the four brain
regions and LFP coherence between the six pairs of brain re-
gions we recorded. Since the dysfunctional networks previously
uncovered in MDD using fMRI show slow-evolving oscillatory
periods that are more than 1 s (ultraslow; <1 Hz) (Greicius
et al., 2007; Sheline et al., 2010), power and coherence were
measured using 1 s temporal windows. This approach allowed
us to identify the ultraslow patterns by which these measures
change over extended periods of time (Figures 2A and 2B). We
then determined the extent to which PFC activity correlated
with each measure of limbic brain activity (18 measures in this
study; there were 3 power measures and 6 coherence measures
for each of the two PFC-dependent frequency bands) over the
recording period (Figures 2B and 2C). Nearly all of the power
and coherence measures we tested showed correlated activity
with PFC (p < 0.05 for 341/342 comparison of 18 correlations/
animal using Spearman rank; N = 19 animals; p = 0.06 for the re-
maining NAc-VTA coherence circuit measure from one animal;
Figure 2C), aligning with fMRI studies that show widespread
functional connectivity between PFC and limbic regions (Sheline
et al., 2010). After confirming that our approach quantified func-
tional connectivity in mice using PFC as the seed region, we used
the raw correlation measures obtained from each implanted
animal as the parameters for a network analysis aimed at identi-
fying the neural architecture underlying the stress-susceptible
state.
Modeling Depression Network Dysfunction Using
Chronic Social Defeat Stress
To infer a ‘‘depression network’’ model that described the
manifestation of the susceptible phenotype, we assayed coher-
ence and power parameters during the FIT. A FIT reactivity
score is defined as the difference in each measure between
when the CD1 is and is not present (XFIT = XCD1 � XEmypty; Fig-
ure 3A). We have shown previously that the PFC LFP-power
reactivity score predicts susceptibility to social defeat stress
in stress-naive mice (Kumar et al., 2014). Here we used the
FIT assay to directly quantify the extent to which an acute
exposure to a CD1 impacts neural circuit function within limbic
regions and frequencies that we found to be PFC directed
(Figure 3A).
We determined the contribution of the 18 neural circuit mea-
sures obtained for each animal to its individual behavioral re-
sponses using a machine learning approach, the elastic net
(Zou and Hastie, 2005). This multivariate regularized regression
method tests the relationship between the 18 circuit-reactivity
values measured during the FIT (i.e., change in R2 values;
X1.n) and the behavioral interaction ratio measured during the
choice interaction test (Y1.n). It infers a network model that ex-
plains the emergence of stress susceptibility. All circuit features
retained in the network model contribute to the network, and
because each of the circuit features is tested within a single
multivariate model, there is no need for classical corrections
for multiple comparisons. In our case, only one circuit feature
Neuron 91, 439–452, July 20, 2016
441
 was retained in the model, converging on the solution of a univar-
iate regression.
The interaction ratio measured for each mouse’s behavior was
directly and specifically related to the correlation between PFC
power and AMY-VTA coherence in the beta oscillatory band dur-
ing the FIT (Figure 3B; hereafter referred to as ‘‘P-AV’’ network).
Exposure to the CD1 mouse decreased the correlation between
PFC beta power and AMY-VTA beta coherence in the suscepti-
ble mice ((�)reactivity in the P-AV network) and increased this
correlation in the resilient animals ((+)reactivity in the P-AV
network; Figure 3C; p < 0.05; R = 0.58 using Pearson correlation).
Notably, only the P-AV beta circuit reactivity measure was re-
tained in the model, suggesting that reactivity in this network ex-
plained the susceptible phenotype independently of the other 17
neural measures we tested. Neither reactivity in PFC beta power
nor AMY-VTA beta coherence alone correlated with the interac-
tion ratio during social interaction testing (Figure 3D). Thus, P-AV
reactivity did not simply reflect a global increase or decrease in
PFC power or AMY-VTA coherence induced by exposure to
the CD1; rather, P-AV reactivity directly reflected changes in
the dynamics that coordinated these two measures across time.
PFC Neurons Signal Synchrony between AMY and VTA
Since our depression network model suggested that PFC activity
was causally linked to beta (14–23 Hz) coherence between AMY
and VTA, we set out to determine if PFC unit firing signaled the
synchronization of beta oscillations in AMY and VTA. We
compared the firing of 169 PFC neurons recorded during the
FIT to the instantaneous phase of AMY and VTA beta oscillations

using phase-locking analysis (Figure 4A,
top). With this approach, we found that 37/
169 PFC neurons phase locked to AMY
beta oscillations (Figure 4A, bottom) and
that 33/169 neurons phase locked to VTA
beta
oscillations
(Figure
4A,
bottom).
Finally, we found that 21/169 PFC neurons
phase locked to beta oscillations in both
AMY and VTA (Figure 4A). Thus, the data
suggest that the coupling between AMY
and VTA beta oscillations can be signaled by the firing of PFC
neurons.
PFC phase locking to both AMY and VTA oscillations provides
one putative mechanism whereby PFC could regulate AMY-VTA
coherence. Nevertheless, there are other possible regulatory
mechanisms. Specifically, PFC neurons could fire relative to
the instantaneous relationship between oscillatory activity in
AMY and VTA (rather than relative to the instantaneous phase
of oscillations in each area; phase locking). To probe for such
a mechanism, we quantified the phase offset between AMY
and VTA beta oscillations at the instant each PFC neuron fired.
Since the phase offset time series between AMY and VTA was
not uniformly distributed (Figure 4A), we expected that PFC neu-
rons would also tend to fire at a non-uniform phase offset be-
tween AMY and VTA (i.e., mean resultant length [MRL] of the
circular vector >0; see Figure 4B). To compare the actual firing
of PFC neurons to the expectations based on purely random
timing we (1) randomly sampled the AMY-VTA phase offset
time series an equivalent number of times that a PFC neuron fired,
(2) grouped these randomly sampled phase offsets and calcu-
lated their MRL, and (3) repeated this process 100,000 times,
yielding a chance MRL distribution for that neuron. We then
compared the phase offsets at which the PFC neurons actually
fired to this random distribution. Neurons that exhibited MRL
values outside of the 95% confidence interval of their chance
MRL distribution were classified as synchrony (‘‘SYNC’’) cells
(Figure 4B). SYNC cells thus represent neurons that fire accord-
ing to specific AMY-VTA phase offsets (compared against a
random population of offsets that occur by chance).
442
Neuron 91, 439–452, July 20, 2016
 Nearly 23% (38/169) of PFC neurons fired relative to the phase
offset between AMY and VTA (phase-offset locking; Figures 4B
and 4C). The majority of SYNC cells (22/38) increased their firing
when oscillatory activity in AMY and VTA was highly synchro-
nized (+SYNC; neuronal firing increased at the dominant phase
offset between AMY and VTA oscillations), while 16/38 of these
SYNC cells increased their firing rate when AMY and VTA beta
oscillations were desynchronized (�SYNC; neuronal firing
increased at the non-dominant phase offset between AMY and
VTA oscillations). Strikingly, the majority of SYNC cells did not
phase lock to AMY or VTA beta oscillations, and the majority of
PFC neurons that phase locked to AMY and VTA oscillations
were not SYNC cells (Figure 4C, bottom).
Prior studies that probe spike-LFP relationships have shown
that assessing the timing relationship between the two, using
the introduction of temporal offsets between spikes and LFPs
as part of the analysis, can clarify the mechanisms underlying
spike-LFP interactions (Kumar et al., 2014; Siapas et al., 2005;
Sigurdsson et al., 2010). Thus, we exploited this approach to
probe the temporal mechanisms underlying the activity of
SYNC cells (Figure 4D). We introduced temporal offsets ranging
from �1 s to 1 s in 100 ms steps into our LFP analyses and recal-
culated the coupling between PFC activity and AMY-VTA syn-
chrony in each of these shifted timeframes. The directionality
of activity between PFC neuron firing and AMY-VTA was deter-

the coupling was observed. Strikingly,
we found that the majority of SYNC cells

synchrony
100 ms in the past (Figure 4D, top), indi-
cating a strong relationship between
SYNC cell firing and AMY-VTA synchrony
in the immediate past. In contrast, few
SYNC cells fired relative to the AMY-
VTA synchrony measured at temporal off-
sets further in the past (6/38, 15%),
demonstrating that phase-offset locking reflected a neural
mechanism that was coordinated on a sub-second timescale.
Nearly half of the SYNC cells fired relative to the synchrony
observed 300 ms in the future (17/38, 45%). The majority of
cells that fired relative to AMY-VTA synchrony in the future
were +SYNC cells (i.e., the firing of these cells signaled an in-
crease in synchrony). Together, our findings show that both
types of SYNC cells detect AMY-VTA synchrony levels in the im-
mediate past, and that +SYNC cells also predict increases in
AMY-VTA synchrony in the immediate future. Notably, these
findings also demonstrated that phase locking and phase-offset
locking were both distinct mechanisms whereby the activity of
PFC neurons could signal AMY and VTA synchrony. Nearly
50% (78/169) of PFC neurons exhibited at least one of these
mechanisms.
Direct PFC Stimulation Is Sufficient to Increase
AMY-VTA Synchrony
Our results so far confirm that PFC neurons signaled the syn-
chronization of AMY-VTA oscillations. To test whether PFC acti-
vation was sufficient to cause coherence between AMY and
VTA, we implanted transgenic mice engineered to express chan-
nelrhodopsin-2 in layer V pyramidal neurons of cortex with
recording electrodes in AMY and VTA, and a stimulating fiber
in PFC (Figure 4E). We then recorded LFP activity during direct

increased beta synchrony between AMY and VTA (Figure 4F).
Thus, PFC firing was indeed sufficient to increase AMY-VTA
coherence. Together, these findings demonstrated a definitive
physiological link between PFC activity and AMY-VTA coher-
ence. The correlation between PFC beta power and AMY-VTA
coherence in stressed animals is not simply a network epiphe-
nomenon. Rather, the correlation between these two neural
measures reflected an emergent property of a PFC-regulated
physiological network (P-AV network).
PFC-AMY Circuit Stimulation Reverses Network and
Behavioral Phenotype Induced by Chronic Stress
We next sought additional evidence of causality by manipulating
the P-AV network in chronically stressed ‘‘susceptible’’ mice and
measuring their behavioral response. Importantly, we sought to
restore normal healthy function to the circuit. We targeted the
PFC-AMY axis of the circuit because our LFP directionality anal-
ysis suggested that PFC exhibited a direct influence on AMY (but
not VTA) activity in the beta frequency band, justifying the
connection between PFC and AMY as a putative target for
manipulating the P-AV network in a manner consistent with the
endogenous network function that already exists.
To modulate PFC-AMY circuit activity, we used a chemoge-
netic approach based on DREADDs. These DREADDs are vari-
ants of muscarinic receptors (�hM3D) that have been modified
to be selectively activated by the pharmacologically inert com-
pound, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO). When activated by CNO,
hM3D increases the likelihood of neuronal firing through
signaling by the G protein Gq (Alexander et al., 2009; Armbruster
et al., 2007). To specifically target neurons within the PFC-AMY
circuit, we used an intersectional approach described in the
Experimental Procedures. This strategy was designed to yield
expression of the DREADDs in AMY neurons that form synaptic
connections with neurons in PFC (i.e., both afferent and efferent
connections; see Figures 5A and 5B) (Gradinaru et al., 2010) (Fig-
ure S2). Next, we evaluated amygdalar cell types impacted by
the DREADDs by measuring CNO-dependent evoked postsyn-
aptic currents in slices from these mice. Activation of the Gq-
DREADDs by CNO reversibly enhanced both evoked excitatory
postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs) and GABAA-evoked inhibitory
postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) in AMY principal neurons (Fig-
ures 5C and 5D; see also Figure S3), implying that the DREADDs
were expressed in both excitatory pyramidal neurons and
inhibitory GABAergic interneurons. The evoked IPSCs were
completed blocked by bath application of 10 mM bicuculline me-
thiodine, indicating that the IPSCs were mediated by GABAA re-
ceptors. Thus, our targeting strategy successfully rendered the
cells in AMY that formed connections with PFC more likely to
fire in response to excitatory input (PFC-AMY circuit stimulation).
Next, we examined the network-level effects of DREADD stim-
ulation in vivo. Mice were virally manipulated using our targeting
strategy and either subjected to chronic social defeat stress or
used as unstressed controls. Following chronic social defeat
stress, stressed mice and the non-stressed controls were im-
planted with recording electrodes in AMY, PFC, and VTA. After
surgical recovery, mice were treated with vehicle (i.p., intraperi-
toneally) and neurophysiological data were collected during a
FIT. Twenty-four hours later, mice were treated with CNO
(i.p.) to induce DREADD activation, and the FIT was repeated
(Figure 6A).
During the initial forced interaction testing session, exposure
to the CD1 mouse reduced connectivity in the P-AV network
(e.g., a decrease in correlation between PFC power and AMY-
VTA coherence; (�)reactivity) in all of the vehicle-treated,
stress-susceptible mice (N = 8; Figure 6B). In stressed, suscep-
tible animals, PFC-AMY circuit activation with CNO selectively
attenuated P-AV network (�)reactivity, such that animals ex-
hibited a smaller decrease in the correlation between PFC beta
power and AMY-VTA beta coherence in response to the CD1
exposure. In non-stressed control animals, treatment with
CNO potentiated P-AV network (�)reactivity. In the resilient
mice, CNO had no impact (N = 6 mice; Figure 6B). Critically, there
was no difference in P-AV network (�)reactivity in uninfected
susceptible mice subjected to repeat FIT testing (p = 0.84 using
rank-sum test; see Figure S4), demonstrating that activation of
the PFC-AMY circuit (and not simply repeat FIT testing) sup-
pressed the ‘‘susceptible-network’’ phenotype we identified in
chronically stressed mice. Control animals on CNO showed
reactivity that resembled the susceptible animals on vehicle,
and susceptible animals on CNO showed reactivity that resem-
bled the resilient and unstressed animals on vehicle. Notably,
stress-susceptible mice treated with vehicle tended to show
(�)reactivity values that were more negative compared to the
vehicle-treated, stress-resilient mice and the non-stressed con-
trols (p = 0.08 and 0.05 using one-tailed rank-sum test; Figure 6B,
bottom), providing additional biological support for the neural
network-based model we inferred using machine learning in
which (�)reactivity signaled susceptibility.
Since the DREADD strategy reversed the ‘‘susceptible-
network’’ neural phenotype in stressed mice (large P-AV reac-
tivity), we hypothesized that activation of the PFC-AMY circuit
might rescue their behavioral responses during the choice inter-
action test as well. We again used our viral infection strategy in
mice with wheat-germ agglutinin (WGA)-Cre in PFC and Gq-
DREADDs or GFP control in AMY. After recovery, mice were

on a 99.7619% confidence interval (a = 0.05/21 bins). The majority of SYNC cells phase-offset locked to AMY-VTA synchrony 100 ms in the past. SYNC cells that
fired at periods of high synchrony (+SYNC cells, green) also coupled to AMY-VTA synchrony 300 ms in the future. Plot below shows all PFC neurons at each of the
temporal offsets we tested. Neurons that showed phase-offset locking at a given LFP temporal lag are shown in yellow.

 subjected to chronic subordination stress or pair-housed as
non-stressed controls (Figure 7A). We initially identified suscep-
tible mice by measuring social behavior using a three-chamber
choice social interaction test (Figure 7B). We used this modified
three-chamber design in order to avoid habituating animals to
the standard chamber and ultimately cofounding the measured
interaction ratio during subsequent testing. Based on prior
studies (Covington et al., 2010), the animals that exhibited the
lowest 60% of social interaction scores in the three-chamber
interaction test were treated as susceptible (Figure 7B). Impor-
tantly, there was no difference in the distribution of interaction
times between the DREADD- and GFP-infected groups of
susceptible mice in the three-chamber test (p = 0.3088 using
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; Figure 7B, inset). Thus, simply ex-
pressing the DREADDs was not sufficient to alter the behavior
of animals in the absence of CNO. Similarly, treatment with
CNO did not impact social interaction behavior in mice that did
not express the DREADD receptor (Figure S5). After identifying
the susceptible animals, all of the experimental mice were tested
in the standard single-chamber choice interaction test following
CNO treatment to stimulate the DREADD (Figure 7C; see Sup-
plemental Experimental Procedures for further description).
Importantly, DREADD stimulation had no effect on the locomotor
profiles displayed by either of the groups (Figure 7D).
GFP-expressing stressed mice (pooled susceptible and resil-
ient animals) exhibited interaction ratios that were lower than the
non-stressed controls (p = 0.024 using Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test), demonstrating that the stressed animals exhibited the
typical profile of behaviors that emerged following social defeat
stress. Comparison of the interaction scores for the stressed
DREADD-infected mice to their GFP-infected controls revealed
that PFC-AMY stimulation increased social interaction in the
stress-susceptible animals and had no effect in the stress-resil-
ient mice (p = 0.027 and 0.96, respectively, using rank-sum test;
Figure 7C). No differences in interaction ratios were observed
between DREADD-expressing stressed mice (pooled suscepti-
ble and resilient animals) and their non-stressed GFP controls
(p = 0.43 using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), demonstrating that
social behavior was normalized in the stressed DREADD-ex-
pressing mice. Interestingly, activation of the PFC-AMY circuit
tended to reduce the interaction ratio in the non-stressed con-
trols as well (p = 0.14 using Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Figure 7C).
Thus, the behavioral responses induced by DREADD activation
mirrored the neurophysiological responses we observed in
each of the groups using in vivo recordings.
Finally, to ensure that the neurophysiological and behavioral
responses observed in susceptible mice during PFC-AMY
DREADD stimulation did not result simply from a DREADD-
induced disruption of normal AMY activity, we repeated experi-
ments in a new group of susceptible animals that expressed
the Gq-DREADD in AMY in a non-circuit-selective manner (Fig-
ure S6). Treatment with CNO in animals expressing Gq-DREADD
under a CaMKII-driven promoter in the AMY failed to restore
normal social interaction behavior or P-AV reactivity in these

ulation of the PFC-AMY circuit reverses the expression of the
‘‘susceptible’’ network and susceptible behavioral phenotypes
after chronic social defeat stress in mice.
DISCUSSION
Animal studies have been particularly useful in dissecting the
neural circuit mechanisms underlying sleep, habit formation,
spatial processing, fear, motor and sensory processing, and
motivation (Crawley, 2007). Nevertheless, there have been
several barriers to using rodents to model the emotional behavior
changes that characterize psychiatric disorders (Nestler and
Hyman, 2010). For example, it has simply not been feasible to
model dysfunction across many of the behavioral domains
observed in MDD, including guilt, mood, hallucinations, and sui-
cidality. An alternative strategy for overcoming this hurdle is to
create animal models that recapitulate the key disruptions in
emotion networks that contribute to psychiatric disorders.
Here we begin to identify and wield manipulations over such net-
works using a multidisciplinary approach including whole-circuit
recordings, stress manipulations, behavioral analysis, machine
learning, and direct brain stimulation using optogenetics to
demonstrate that changes in specific PFC-regulated neural
networks signal the emergence of behavioral dysfunction in a
widely validated rodent model of depression. Furthermore, we
provide direct evidence using DREADDs that normal emotional
behavior is restored by reversal of a naturally occurring
network-level disruption brought on by chronic stress. To our
knowledge, this is the first demonstration of electrophysiolog-
ical parallels between a key neural network-level phenotype
observed in patients with MDD and emotional deficits in a pre-
clinical model of the disorder. The preclinical model now affords
us detailed and more comprehensive understanding of the spe-

cific real-time dynamics of network func-
tion that are not currently available in
humans, thus uncovering novel targets
for therapeutic development.
We began these studies with the well-
recognized findings from both clinical
and pre-clinical models that regulation of
emotional behavior is highly dependent
on the PFC. The PFC makes direct mono-
synaptic
connections
with
multiple
limbic
brain
regions,
including AMY and VTA (Oh et al., 2014), and these PFC-depen-
dent circuits have been shown to regulate anxiety (Likhtik et al.,
2014), fear (Kumar et al., 2014), and psychomotor activity (Kim
et al., 2015). Multiple studies have also implicated the dysregu-
lation of PFC-dependent circuits as a central endophenotype
of depression (Dzirasa et al., 2013; Greicius et al., 2007; Kumar
et al., 2013; Mayberg et al., 1999; Salvadore et al., 2010; Sheline
et al., 2010). Further, chronic antidepressant treatment reverses
this neural circuit phenotype in the mouse model of depression
(Dzirasa et al., 2013). We built on these findings in order to begin
to dissect the distinct disruptions in emotion network critical for
advancing understanding of psychiatric disorders. We now find
that the emergence of behavioral pathology in a chronic
stress-based model of MDD is associated with altered function
across ultraslow PFC-dependent beta networks.
The studies presented here provide one of the first glimpses of
large-scale network analysis that will be critical to unraveling the
complex encoding of emotional processing. We identified the
P-AV network, whereby susceptible responses are reflected in
failure of coordination between PFC power and AMY-VTA coher-
ence, using a data-driven strategy based in machine learning.
The model solution generated by the elastic net is comprised
of the non-zero coefficients that account best for the network re-
cordings. Taken together, our behavioral, neurophysiological,
and stimulation-based experiments provide strong support for
the network model generated using our data-driven strategy.
On a cellular level, we show that nearly 50% of single units in
the PFC neurons phase lock to oscillations in AMY and/or VTA,
or to the phase offset between AMY and VTA oscillations
(phase-offset locking; SYNC cells). To our knowledge, the iden-
tification of SYNC cells marks the first time that cortical activity
has been shown to signal the phase offset between spatially
distinct subcortical oscillations. Directionality studies of the
Neuron 91, 439–452, July 20, 2016
447
 phase-offset lock phenomenon indicated that the majority of
SYNC cells phase-offset locked to limbic beta oscillatory activity
100 ms in the immediate past (i.e., AMY-VTA phase synchrony
state preceded PFC firing), and nearly half of the SYNC cells
also phase-offset locked to activity nearly 900 ms in the future
(i.e., PFC firing preceded AMY-VTA phase synchrony state).
Thus, SYNC cells may lie within a PFC-mediated feedback con-
trol circuit that detects and regulates the timing of sub-cortical
oscillations to enable distinct network-level computations. This
is consistent with our optogenetic findings, which showed that
direct PFC activation was sufficient to increase the beta coher-
ence between AMY and VTA. Our findings also raise the hypoth-
esis that phase-offset locking may serve as a general brain
mechanism whereby the cortex coordinates spatially distributed
brain regions to promote emotional behavior.
PFC activity has been shown to signal safety in threatening
environments (Adhikari et al., 2010). In animals that exhibit
behavioral dysfunction after stress (e.g., susceptible mice),
acute CD1 exposure disrupts the regulation of AMY and VTA in-
teractions by PFC. Furthermore, direct stimulation of PFC-AMY
circuitry using DREADDs normalizes activity in the P-AV beta

between AMY and VTA
may assign
salience to threat cues in order to signal
risk during various emotion experiences.
When this coherence signal is regulated
by PFC, an animal can maintain its normal
function under threatening conditions.
Thus, our findings suggest that the P-AV
network contributes to the emotion expe-
riences that guide behavior. Our observations suggest that the
relationship between P-AV reactivity and emotional regulation
may lie along a U-shaped curve (Figure 8). The state of a given
emotional network along this curve is modulated by PFC inputs
to AMY since this PFC-AMY circuit is altered by chronic stress
and direct stimulation of this circuitry using DREADDs. Given
that deficits in functional connectivity across PFC-dependent
networks have been described in MDD (Greicius et al., 2007; Nu-
gent et al., 2015), activity across the P-AV network may serve as
a novel translational measure of face validity in preclinical
models of MDD.
Using circuit manipulation, we were able to restore the P-AV
network in stressed animals to the natural state that occurs in
unstressed animals under standard physiological conditions.
Our viral infection strategy resulted in DREADD expression in
inhibitory and excitatory neurons. The PFC makes direct projec-
tions on glutamatergic neurons and feedforward local inhibitory
circuits in AMY (Ehrlich et al., 2009). Given that local inhibitory-
excitatory circuits are critical to generating oscillatory activity
(Bartos et al., 2007), this feedforward circuitry may play a central
role in regulating local oscillatory timing, ultimately synchronizing
448

 AMY beta oscillations with efferent input from PFC. The suscep-
tible brain state may then reflect the extent to which stress in-
duces plasticity in these circuits. Our WGA-Cre viral targeting
strategy also results in DREADD expression in AMY neurons
that project to PFC. Many of these glutamatergic neurons also
send axon collaterals to NAc (McDonald, 1991), providing
cellular mechanisms whereby decreasing the input resistance
of AMY neurons could potentially serve to coordinate large-scale
subcortical limbic dynamics timed to PFC input.
Our DREADD manipulation directly targets the capacity of
PFC to regulate AMY by increasing the likelihood of AMY
neuronal
firing
in
response
to
efferent
input
(ultimately
decreasing the input resistance of excitatory PFC efferents). In
the absence of novel closed-loop optogenetic protocols, which
stimulate the brain timed to ongoing patterns of activity in PFC,
even direct stimulation of PFC to AMY axon terminals would
fail to achieve this type of regulation. For instance, optogenetic
stimulation has been used to drive neurons based on their pro-
jection targets (Chaudhury et al., 2013; Stuber et al., 2011),
and in this study we use a transgenic approach to selectively
stimulate PFC efferents in layer V. Nevertheless, nearly all proto-
cols for such open-loop optogenetic stimulation ‘‘override’’ the
ongoing oscillatory dynamics that coordinate PFC output under
physiological conditions, thus failing to restore the regulation of
AMY activity by PFC dynamics. To this point, we show that expo-
sure to a CD1 decreases AMY-VTA coherence in both the sus-
ceptible and resilient mice (see Figure 3B, bottom). Thus, it is
the regulation of AMY-VTA coherence by PFC, and not AMY-
VTA coherence itself per se, that underlies susceptibility. While
multiple open-loop optogenetic stimulation protocols (including
PFC layer V stimulation, as shown here) may increase AMY-
VTA coherence, they would be unlikely to achieve the type of
regulation necessary to correct the P-AV network dysfunction
that defines the susceptible brain state. Indeed, there is a
growing appreciation in the field that the timing, duration, and
target and off-target effects from cellular manipulation are critical
considerations for the interpretation of network and behavioral
responses (Otchy et al., 2015).
Psychological stress is a major risk factor for the onset and
exacerbation of MDD. Stress induces adaptations in cortical
and limbic circuitry (Campioni et al., 2009; Dias-Ferreira et al.,
2009; Ghosh et al., 2013; Kim et al., 1996; Yuen et al., 2012).
For example, multiple distinct stress-induced cellular and molec-
ular adaptations have been shown to regulate chronic social
defeat syndrome in rodents. These adaptations include synaptic
potentiation of thalamic inputs into NAc (Christoffel et al., 2015), Ih
current increases in VTA (Friedman et al., 2014), and gene
expression changes in PFC (Covington et al., 2010; Vialou
et al., 2014). Since manipulation of several distinct network nodes
(circuits/brain areas) is sufficient to overcome these stress-
induced cellular modifications to restore the normal emotional
behavior (Bagot et al., 2015; Christoffel et al., 2015; Covington
et al., 2010; Friedman et al., 2014), it is likely that these distinct
molecular adaptations converge at the level of circuits or brain
networks to yield the syndrome. Here we integrate the disparate
neural sites involved in stress responses by showing how chronic
stress alters the PFC-dependent coordination of long-range
limbic networks to yield dysfunction in emotional behavior.
Our findings suggest that a disruption in the capacity of PFC
to coordinate neural interactions between AMY and VTA may
be a central brain mechanism underlying MDD. Furthermore,
therapeutics that directly target these network interactions
may have the potential to rapidly ameliorate depression
psychopathology.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animal Care and Use
Studies were conducted with approved protocols from the Duke University
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were in accordance with
the NIH guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. See Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures for additional details.
Electrode Implantation Surgery
At an age of 6–7 weeks, C57 mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and
placed in a stereotaxic device, and metal ground screws were secured to
the cranium. A total of 32 tungsten microwires were arranged in array bundles
and implanted in AMY (basolateral AMY and central extended AMY), NAc, PFC
(prelimbic and infralimbic cortex), and VTA. See Supplemental Experimental
Procedures for additional details. Histological analysis of implantation sites

Figure 8. Model of Stress Effects on P-AV Reactivity and Threat
Regulation
The relationship between P-AV reactivity and threat regulation can be modeled
by the upside-down U-shaped curve that is common to many biological sys-
tems. Chronic stress drives the network state to the right such that P-AV
reactivity decreases. Susceptible mice show the largest P-AV reactivity
change and the largest behavioral dysregulation, while little differences in
either measure are observed in resilient mice (top). Stimulation of the PFC-
AMY circuit moves the network state to the left such that P-AV reactivity
increases in susceptible mice, restoring normal reactivity and behavioral
regulation. In the control mice, this manipulation destabilizes the normal
network state and decreases P-AV reactivity (bottom).

 was performed at the conclusion of experiments to confirm recording sites
used for neurophysiological analysis (see Figure S7).
Neurophysiological Data Acquisition
Headstages were connected without anesthesia 30 min prior to recording ses-
sions. All neurophysiological recordings were performed during the FIT.
Neuronal activity was sampled at 30 kHz using the Cerebus acquisition system
(Blackrock Microsystems Inc.). LFPs were bandpass filtered at 0.5–250 Hz and
stored at 1,000 Hz. Neurophysiological recordings were referenced to a
ground wire connected to ground screws.
Determination of LFP Oscillatory Power and Cross-Area Synchrony
Signals recorded from all of the implanted microwires were used for analysis.
Using MATLAB (MathWorks), a sliding Fourier transform with Hamming win-
dow was applied to the LFP signal using a 1 s window and a 1 s step. Fre-
quencies were analyzed with a resolution of 1 Hz. Additional analytical details
are available in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Elastic Net Analysis
The spearman rank correlation coefficient was calculated between each limbic
activity measure (three power measures and six coherence measures) and
PFC power in the 2–7 Hz and 14–23 Hz range. FIT reactivity was then calcu-
lated for each of the 18 activity measures as RHO2
(CD1) � RHO2
(Empty). The
18 calculated reactivity measures were used as observation variables, and
the interaction scores measured during the choice interaction test were taken
as the response at each observation.

with N the number of observations, yi the response at observation i, xi a vector of

b0 a scalar ‘‘intercept,’’ and b coefficients on the different features (Zou and

optimized based on the global minimum of the mean squared error with alpha
values ranging from 10�6 to 0.9 incremented on a logarithmic scale. Data
were analyzed using the MATLAB Machine Learning toolbox (MathWorks).
Optogenetic Stimulation
The optogenetic experiment reflects additional analyses of data described in a
previous experiment (Kumar et al., 2013). Briefly, B6.Cg-Tg(Thy1-ChR2/EYFP)
18Gfng/J were obtained from Jackson labs. Six 4- to 8-month-old heterozy-
gous mice were implanted with a stimulating fiber in PFC, and recording
electrodes in PFC, AMY, NAc, and VTA. Following surgical recovery, neuro-
physiological recordings were obtained while mice were stimulated in PFC us-
ing a pre-recorded PrL neuron spike pattern with a mean rate (4.02 Hz). Our
physiology experiments were performed with a laser power of 2.5 mW, and
the light fiber was located directly above the superior sagittal sinus.
Viral Infusions
At an age of 6–7 weeks, C57 mice were anesthetized with ketamine
(100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg), placed in a stereotaxic device, and
injected with AAV-EF1a-mCherry-IRES-WGA-Cre (WGA-Cre) based on ste-
reotaxic coordinates measured from bregma at the skull (PFC, 1.96 mm
anterior-posterior [AP], ± 0.0.62 mm mediolateral [ML], and �2.28 mm dor-
sal-ventral [DV] at a 10� angle). Mice were also injected with AAV-hSyn-DIO-
HA-hM3D(Gq)-IRES-mCitrine (Gq-DREADD) or AAV-hSyn-DIO-EGFP (GFP)
based on stereotaxic coordinates measured from bregma (AMY, �1.46 mm
AP, ± 2.9 mm ML, and �4.9 mm DV). A total of 0.5 mL of each virus was deliv-
ered bilaterally at each injection site over 5 min using a 5 mL Hamilton syringe.
All viruses were obtained from the UNC Gene Therapy Center. Mice were
singly housed for 2 weeks to allow for surgery recovery. Mice were then sub-
jected to 15 days of chronic social defeat stress. Social interaction behaviors
were tested with either the three-chamber social interaction test or the single-
chamber social interaction test (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures
for more details).
For in vivo neurophysiology experiments in virally infused animals, mice
were implanted with microwire recording electrodes after chronic social defeat
stress, as described above. It should be noted that these mice were anesthe-
tized with isoflurane (1.5%); ketamine was not utilized in the post-chronic so-
cial defeat stress surgery given its antidepressant-like effects on chronic
stressed mice (Donahue et al., 2014). At the completion of all behavioral and
neurophysiological studies, mice were perfused transcardially with 4% PFA
(EM Sciences), and brains were harvested, frozen, and sliced at 35 mm
using a cryostat (Cryocut 1800, Reichert-Jung) and stained with an anti-GFP
antibody at a dilution of 1:2,000 (rabbit polyclonal, A11122, Invitrogen) accord-
ing to recommended Invitrogen protocol (see Supplemental Experimental Pro-
cedures). Fluorescence microscopy was used to identify both mCherry
expression co-expressed with the WGA-Cre in PFC as well as FITC-stained
mCitrine in the AMY using a Nikon Eclipse 80i fluorescence microscope.
Confocal images were taken using a Zeiss LSM 510 inverted confocal
microscope.
Mouse Brain Slice Preparation for Single-Cell Recordings
Mice infected with Gq-DREADDs were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane.
The brain was quickly removed from the skull after decapitation and immedi-
ately chilled in an ice-cold, oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) so-
lution containing 120 mM NaCl, 3.3 mM KCl, 25 mM NaHCO3, 1.23 mM
NaH2PO4 H2O, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgSO4, and 10 mM glucose. Coronal
slices (300 mm thickness) containing the AMY were cut with a moving blade
microtome, and the slices were then kept in normal oxygenated aCSF at
35�C for 60 min. The slices were then kept at room temperature until used
for recording.
A single slice was transferred to the recording chamber that was constantly
perfused (�3 mL/min) with oxygenated aCSF at 35�C. The AMY principal neu-
rons were viewed under a Zeiss upright microscope equipped with a 403
water immersion objective and an enhanced differential interference contrast
(DIC) video microscope system. Recording electrodes with resistance of
4–8 MU were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (1.5 mm outside diam-
eter [OD]) using a P97 electrode puller. Access resistance and input capaci-
tance were electronically compensated by approximately 60%–70% and
monitored throughout the experiment to confirm the stability of the recording.
The internal pipette solution contained 130 mM CsCl, 4 mM NaCL, 0.2 mM
EGTA, 4 mM Mg-ATP, 0.3 mM Tri-GTP, 10 mM HEPES, and 6 mM QX-314.
The pH was adjusted to 7.4 with CsOH, and osmolarity was 290 mOsm. Sig-
nals were filtered at 5 kHz and were digitized at 10 kHz through a Digidata1440
interface controlled by pClamp10 software (Molecular Devices).
In all instances, EPSCs and IPSCs were initially recorded for 5 min to estab-
lish stable baseline values. Without altering the perfusion rate and tempera-
ture, the perfusion medium was then switched to one containing CNO (1 mM)
for 10 min, followed by a drug washout. Synaptic responses were analyzed
off-line using Clampfit 10 software (Molecular Devices). A paired t test was
used to determine the statistical significance.
