Abstract
Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM cells) have been widely characterized in infectious disease 
settings; however, their role in mediating immunity to cancer remains unknown. Here we report 
that skin-resident memory T cell responses to melanoma are generated naturally as a result of 
autoimmune vitiligo. Melanoma antigen-specific TRM cells resided predominantly in melanocyte-
depleted hair follicles and were maintained without recirculation or replenishment from the 
lymphoid compartment. These cells expressed CD103, CD69, and CLA, but lacked PD-1 or 
LAG-3, and were capable of making IFN-γ. CD103 expression on CD8 T cells was required for 
establishment of TRM cells in skin, but was dispensable for vitiligo development. Importantly, 
CD103+ CD8 TRM cells were critical for protection against melanoma re-challenge. This work 
establishes that CD103-dependent TRM cells play a key role in perpetuating anti-tumor immunity.
Introduction
Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM cells) are crucial mediators of adaptive immunity in 
peripheral tissues. CD8 TRM cells have been characterized in association with infections of 
the skin, gut, lung, and genitourinary tract (1–4), where they mediate long-lived protection 
against re-infection (5–7). Separately, TRM cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of

 certain inflammatory conditions of the skin, including psoriasis (8) and mycosis fungoides 
(9). Despite their widespread involvement in diseases of peripheral tissues, it remains 
unknown whether TRM cells can mediate immunity to cancer.
Generation of T cell memory is paramount to ensuring durable anti-tumor immunity, 
although studies in cancer models have focused on lymphoid memory (10). Our work 
previously identified key requirements for generating lymphoid memory against melanoma 
(11). We showed that the autoimmune destruction of normal host melanocytes, a condition 
known as vitiligo, is required to sustain melanoma/melanocyte antigen (Ag)-specific T cells 
in lymph nodes and spleens for many months (11). This is consistent with the long-
recognized role of vitiligo as an independent positive prognostic factor in melanoma patients 
(12, 13), and more recently in patients treated with pembrolizumab who exhibit vitiligo 
incidence as high as 25% (14). While our studies implicated vitiligo in sustaining lymphoid 
memory, a growing role for resident memory in cutaneous immune settings suggests that 
vitiligo might also support the generation of TRM cells.
Seminal studies characterizing TRM cells in infectious disease models and under steady state 
conditions, provide a basis to identify resident memory responses against cancer. Cutaneous 
infections generate skin TRM cells with an effector memory-like phenotype that persist in the 
epidermis without recirculation through lymphoid tissues (1, 5, 6). Skin TRM cells are 
phenotypically CD44hi, CD62Llo, and are distinguished from lymphoid memory by the 
expression of CD69, cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA), and CD103 (15–17). CLA is a 
fucosyltransferase VII (FucT-VII)–modified derivate of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 
(PSGL-1), which is critical for T cell entry into skin (6, 18). CD103 is the TGF-β induced 
α-chain of the αEE7 integrin, which binds to E-cadherin on epidermal cells in peripheral 
tissues. Thus, CLA and CD103 are thought to position and retain TRM cells in skin as a 
barrier to re-infection (15, 16). Interestingly, CD8 T cells expressing CD103 have been 
identified in human lung and ovarian carcinoma specimens, where they are associated with 
significantly improved overall survival (19, 20). However, these T cells appeared 
functionally exhausted prior to PD-1 blockade (19). Thus, it remains unknown how tumor-
specific CD103+ CD8 T cells are generated, whether they represent bona fide resident 
memory, and to what extent they contribute to anti-tumor immunity.
The present studies are based on our hypothesis that vitiligo-affected skin supports resident 
memory T cells that participate in the immune response to melanoma. We employ a mouse 
model of melanoma-associated vitiligo, induced by depletion of regulatory T cells (Treg 
cells) and surgical excision of a primary dermal B16 melanoma (11, 21). The goals of this 
study were three-fold: (1) to define the characteristics of tumor-specific TRM cells, (2) to 
illustrate T cell- and host-intrinsic requirements for generating TRM cells against melanoma, 
and (3) to define a role for TRM cells in mediating tumor protection. Our findings establish a 
key role for TRM in sustaining immunity to cancer.

 Results
Functional melanoma Ag-specific TRM cells develop in the skin of mice with vitiligo
Our prior studies showed that dermal inoculation with B16 melanoma followed by Treg cell 
depletion and curative tumor excision (Fig. 1A) breaks tolerance to melanocyte antigens, 
resulting in autoimmune vitiligo in ~60% of mice (11, 21). Consistent with our prior finding 
that vitiligo is CD8 T cell-mediated (11), we found that CD8 T cells were enriched in the 
skin of vitiligo-affected mice, as compared with unaffected mice (Fig. 1B). To track the 
melanoma/melanocyte antigen-specific response in skin, mice received congenically-marked 
naïve transgenic CD8 T cells specific for gp10025–33 (pmel cells) (22). This small sentinel 
population of low-avidity T cells is primed during tumor growth (23), yet does not influence 
the extent or kinetics of vitiligo (11). Thirty days after surgery, pmel cell populations were 
greatly elevated in skin from vitiligo-affected mice as compared with unaffected mice (Fig. 
1C). Pmel cells could be recovered throughout the skin of mice with vitiligo, but proportions 
were significantly increased in perilesional as compared with pigmented sites (Fig. 1D; 
depigmented and perilesional sites depicted in the representative image, were used 
interchangeably for subsequent analyses). As compared with lymph node and spleen, pmel 
cells were enriched 10- to 100-fold in skin (Fig. 1E). Thus, Ag-specific T cells exhibited 
strong preferential persistence throughout skin of mice with vitiligo.
Phenotypic analysis indicated that pmel cells in skin were overwhelmingly CD44hi and 
CD62Llo, and also expressed high levels of the TRM cell markers CD103 and CD69 (Fig. 
1F). Approximately 50% of these cells also expressed the skin-specific marker CLA (Fig. 
1F). CD103 and CLA expression were higher in skin as compared with lymphoid tissues; 
however, CD69 expression was also elevated in lymph node (Fig. 1F), as expected (11). A 
similar phenotype was observed for total CD8 T cells in vitiligo-affected skin (Fig. S1). 
Thus, T cells in skin of vitiligo-affected mice exhibited a resident memory phenotype.
To determine if persistence in skin was limited to T cells with melanocyte antigen 
specificity, mice were instead transferred with small sentinel populations of naïve OT-I cells, 
and vitiligo was induced using B16 cells expressing OVA as a model tumor-specific antigen. 
Similar to pmel cells, OT-I cells persisted at substantially higher levels in skin as compared 
with lymphoid tissues of mice with vitiligo (Fig. 1G), where they exhibited a 
CD62LloCD103hiCD69+CLA+/− TRM cell phenotype (Fig. S1). Thus, CD8 T cells with 
specificity for both tumor-specific and shared antigens were maintained in vitiligo-affected 
skin. However, pmel cells persisted at ~10-fold higher levels than OT-I cells (Fig. 1H). 
Therefore, subsequent analyses focused on the pmel response.
We next assessed whether pmel cells in skin maintained functional capacity. Further 
phenotypic analysis of the population indicated negligible expression of the exhaustion 
markers PD-1 and LAG-3 (Fig. 2A). Accordingly, ex vivo re-stimulation of these cells with 
cognate gp100 peptide elicited production of IFN-γ at levels comparable to pmel cells from 
lymph nodes (Fig. 2B). Additionally, in skin of vitiligo-affected mice that had not received 
pmel cells, IFN-γ-producing TRP-2180–188-specific CD8 T cells could be detected, 
indicating a functional endogenous response (Fig. S2). To more precisely establish the 
localization of T cells within skin, microscopy was performed on perilesional skin sections.

 Consistent with their CD103 expression, CD8 T cells and pmel cells were located in 
proximity to E-cadherin-expressing cells at the dermal-epidermal junction, predominantly 
within hair follicles (Fig. 2C), the primary location of skin melanocytes in mice (24). 
Furthermore, T cells in perilesional skin were preferentially associated with follicles 
containing white hairs (Fig. 2D). Thus melanoma-specific T cells persisted in melanocyte-
depleted hair follicles, and were not functionally exhausted.
To conclusively determine whether CD8 T cells in vitiligo-affected skin are resident 
memory, we assessed their ability to persist when isolated from the lymphoid compartment. 
First, perilesional skin containing pmel cells was grafted onto RAG−/− recipients, which 
were then rested for 50 days. During this time, skin grafts progressed to complete 
depigmentation but surrounding host tissue remained pigmented (Fig. S3). We found that 
both CD8 T cells and pmel cells in skin grafts on RAG−/− mice were undiminished, as 
compared with vitiligo-affected control skin (Fig. 3A). In skin graft-draining lymph nodes, 
small populations of CD8 T cells were identified, however pmel cells were absent (Fig. 3B), 
suggesting that tumor/self Ag-specific T cells do not recirculate. Moreover, pmel cells in 
grafted skin retained a CD103+CD69+CLA+ phenotype that was comparable to those in 
vitiligo-affected control skin (Fig. 3C), but distinct from the CD103− CLA− phenotype of 
CD8 T cells that had migrated to lymph nodes (Fig. S4). As a second approach to address 
residency, wild-type vitiligo-affected mice were treated with the S1P receptor agonist 
FTY720 for 35 days to block T cell egress from lymph nodes. FTY720 reduced circulating 
CD8 T cells (Fig. 3D), but did not reduce populations of CD8 T cells (Fig. 3E; p = 0.311) or 
pmel cells (Fig. 3F; p = 0.999) in skin, nor did it alter TRM cell phenotypic marker 
expression (Fig. 3G). These data collectively illustrate the maintenance of a self-sustaining, 
TRM cell population in skin of vitiligo-affected mice.
Vitiligo is required for the generation of melanoma-specific TRM cells
While the above data demonstrated the development of TRM cells in association with 
vitiligo, an absolute requirement for host vitiligo remained to be shown. We previously 
found that vitiligo-affected mice initially prime larger Ag-specific T cell responses than 
those that remain unaffected (11), indicating that the establishment of resident memory 
could be due to enhanced priming. To determine if host vitiligo was required, we normalized 
T cell priming by pooling pmel cells from lymphoid tissues of multiple donor mice on the 
day of surgery. This uniform population was then adoptively transferred into treatment-
matched recipient mice, some of which would subsequently develop vitiligo, and others of 
which would not (Fig. 4A). Transferred pmel cells had an overwhelmingly 
KLRG1loCXCR3+Ki67hi phenotype (Fig. 4B), consistent with TRM precursor cells 
described in skin HSV infection (15). A proportion of these cells also expressed CD103 
(Fig. S5). Thirty days following adoptive transfer, small populations of pmel cells were 
detected in skin of 7 out of 10 recipients that developed vitiligo versus only 1 out of 8 
unaffected mice (Figs. 4C and D), supporting a requirement for host vitiligo in the 
development of resident memory.
To confirm this finding using a second model of vitiligo, TRP-1113–125 melanocyte Ag-
specific CD4 T cells were transferred into RAG−/− mice to become activated and induce

 vitiligo as previously shown (25), or into RAG−/−TRP-1−/− mice (which lack the target Ag) 
to serve as unaffected controls (Fig. 4E). Tumor-primed pmel cells (described above) were 
then transferred into these vitiligo-affected or unaffected recipients. Consistent with the 
above experiment, significantly larger pmel cell populations were identified in skin of 
vitiligo-affected mice thirty days later, as compared with unaffected controls (Fig. 4F; p = 
0.002). Pmel cells in vitiligo-affected skin were overwhelmingly 
CD44hiCD62LloCD103hiCD69+, and exhibited mixed expression of CLA (Fig. 4G). 
Therefore, host vitiligo was required for the generation of melanoma/melanocyte antigen-
specific TRM cells.
FucT-VII and CD103 are required for optimal formation of tumor-specific TRM cells
To identify T cell-intrinsic requirements for the development of vitiligo-driven TRM cells, 
we initially focused on CLA, a FucT-VII-glycosylated isoform of PSGL-1 (18). T cells 
deficient in FucT-VII lack expression of CLA, as we confirmed (Fig. S6). Indeed, 
melanoma-associated vitiligo was greatly reduced in FucT-VII−/− mice (Fig. 5A), although 
tumor growth was also unexpectedly enhanced (Fig. S7). Regardless, vitiligo was also 
reduced in RAG−/− mice that had been reconstituted with FucT-VII−/− CD8 T cells (Fig. 
5B), in which tumor growth was normal (Fig. S7), thus indicating an important role for 
FucT-VII in vitiligo development.
To determine the role of FucT-VII in the establishment of skin TRM cells in a setting where 
vitiligo was not impaired, congenically-distinct, naïve sentinel populations of wild-type 
(WT) and FucT-VII−/− pmel cells were co-transferred at a 1:1 ratio into wild-type mice prior 
to vitiligo induction. Fifty days after surgery, we observed a profound reduction in FucT-
VII−/− pmel cells, relative to WT pmel cells, in vitiligo-affected skin (Fig. 5C; p = 0.004). 
This was not due to a defect in priming, as FucT-VII−/− pmel cells had expanded to an even 
greater extent than wild type cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes prior to surgery (Fig. 5D). 
However, early T cell accumulation in skin was significantly impaired by FucT-VII 
deficiency (Fig. 5E; p = 0.013), suggesting that a defect in skin access contributed to the 
defect in memory. Surprisingly, FucT-VII−/− pmel cells also demonstrated reduced lymphoid 
memory formation (Fig. 5F; p = 0.010). Thus, in accordance with substantially reduced 
vitiligo, loss of FucT-VII (and CLA) in CD8 T cells perturbed T cell access to skin, and 
impaired the establishment of both lymphoid and resident memory compartments.
Pmel cells in vitiligo-affected skin also expressed high levels of CD103 (see Fig. 1F), which 
is important for TRM cell formation in HSV skin infection (15). In contrast to FucT-VII−/− 
mice, melanoma-associated vitiligo occurred with unaltered incidence and kinetics in 
CD103−/− mice (Fig. 6A), and in CD8−/− mice that had been reconstituted with CD103−/− 
CD8 T cells (Fig. 6B). We noted, however, that CD103−/− mice and CD8−/− mice 
reconstituted with CD103−/− CD8 T cells had a lower incidence of vitiligo that had 
disseminated beyond the surgical site (Fig. 6C and D). Therefore, CD8 T cell expression of 
CD103 was not required for vitiligo, however it enhanced disease severity.
To separately assess a role for CD103 in the development of TRM cells, congenically-distinct 
populations of wild-type and CD103−/− pmel cells were co-transferred at a 1:1 ratio into 
wild-type mice prior to melanoma-associated vitiligo induction. Forty-five days after tumor

 excision, there was a significant reduction in CD103−/− relative to WT pmel cells in vitiligo-
affected skin, although a minor CD103-independent population persisted (Fig. 6E; p = 
0.005). Unexpectedly, CD103-deficiency impaired T cell accumulation in skin as early as 
the day of tumor excision (Fig. 6F; p = 0.005). Defects in skin access and TRM cell 
formation were not due to reduced T cell priming, as CD103−/− populations expanded 
normally in tumor-draining lymph nodes (Fig. 6G). Moreover, in contrast to FucT-VII-
deficiency, loss of CD103 did not impair the formation of lymphoid memory (Fig. 6H). 
Additionally, CD8 T cell access to tumors (Fig. 6I), production of IFN-γ (Fig. 6J), and 
acute rejection of established B16 tumors (Fig. S8), were unaffected by CD103-deficiency. 
Thus, the loss of CD103 on CD8 T cells only appeared to reduce T cell accumulation in skin 
and the subsequent establishment of resident memory.
CD103-dependent TRM cells are necessary for long-lived immunity to melanoma
We previously demonstrated that mice with melanoma-associated vitiligo are protected 
against melanoma re-challenge >1 month after surgery, in flanks contralateral to 
depigmented surgery sites (11, 21). However, the protective memory T cell compartment 
was not identified. As the above data show that CD103-deficiency impairs TRM cell 
formation without perturbing lymphoid memory, this model was used to identify a role for 
CD103+ TRM cells in mediating tumor protection. CD8−/− mice reconstituted with CD103−/− 
or WT CD8 T cells were treated to induce melanoma-associated vitiligo as in Fig. 1A. Those 
that developed vitiligo (equivalent in both groups; Fig. 6B) were re-challenged thirty days 
later with intradermal B16 melanoma on contalateral flanks. In contrast to mice 
reconstituted with WT CD8 T cells, which had strong tumor immunity, those reconstituted 
with CD103−/− T cells demonstrated no tumor protection (Fig. 7A). Thus, CD103 expression 
on CD8 T cells was absolutely required for tumor protection in skin of vitiligo-affected 
mice.
To assess whether TRM cells were capable of providing tumor protection independent of 
lymphoid memory, FTY720 was administered daily to wild-type mice, starting 2 weeks prior 
to tumor re-challenge, to sequester tissue non-resident T cells in lymph nodes, and mice 
were again re-challenged on contralateral flanks. Indeed, tumor protection in vitiligo-
affected mice was completely unaffected by FTY720 treatment (Fig. 7B), indicating that the 
lymphoid compartment was not required for tumor immunity. However, treatment with a 
CD8 depleting antibody, which efficiently eliminated CD8 T cells from both lymphoid 
tissues and skin (Fig. S9), abrogated tumor immunity in FTY720-treated mice (Fig. 7B). 
Contralateral flanks were still pigmented at the time of re-challenge, and protection was 
independent of whether or not this area eventually depigmented (Fig. S10), indicating that 
protective TRM responses were not limited to lesional skin of mice with vitiligo. Moreover, 
vitiligo-affected mice exhibited no cross-protection against the unrelated Lewis Lung 
carcinoma, demonstrating that protection was tumor antigen-specific (Fig. S11). 
Collectively, these results show that CD103+ CD8 TRM cells are necessary and sufficient for 
long-lived melanoma protection in skin of vitiligo-affected mice.

 Discussion
The present studies establish that TRM cells provide durable immunity to cancer. We 
demonstrate that autoimmune tissue destruction provides a hospitable niche for tumor-
specific T cell residence in peripheral tissue. Indeed, melanoma-associated vitiligo supports 
TRM cells that persist and function independently from the lymphoid compartment. Thus, 
skin of hosts with vitiligo provides the necessary components of long-lived protection 
against melanoma.
Here we show that a number of concepts from studies of infectious disease extend to TRM in 
cancer. Melanoma-specific TRM cells resemble viral Ag-specific skin TRM cells in their 
generation from a KLRG1−CXCR3+ precursor (15), their CD44hiCD62LloCD103hiCD69+ 
phenotype (1, 17), and their long-term persistence throughout skin (1, 5, 6). Notably, we 
demonstrate that TRM cells are primary mediators of long-lived cutaneous immunity to 
cancer, which parallels the protective requirement for TRM cells in prevention of viral re-
infection (5, 6).
We report that vitiligo supports resident memory against both tumor-specific and self-
antigens, which could both participate in long-lived protection against melanoma. However, 
encounter with self-antigen in skin was shown to enhance the size of TRM cell populations, 
consistent with a role for persistent Ag in promoting resident memory formation during viral 
infection (26). Our observation that gp100-specific TRM cells reside predominantly in 
follicles containing white hairs, together with published findings that IL-7 and IL-15 
production by hair follicles maintains TRM cells (27), suggests that these follicles serve as an 
antigen-free niche. Despite this, we show that protection against melanoma re-challenge is 
afforded even in pigmented areas of skin, indicating widespread TRM cell function. As 
melanocytes reside only in hair follicles in C57BL/6 mice, studies are still needed to assess 
whether non-exhausted TRM cells develop in vitiligo-affected melanoma patients, wherein 
melanocytes also reside at the dermal-epidermal junction. Of note, the functional status of 
TRM cells in vitiligo-affected skin is distinct from the exhausted state of CD103+ CD8 T 
cells that infiltrate human lung and ovarian carcinomas (19, 20).
Regarding T cell-intrinsic requirements for TRM cell generation, we illustrate important yet 
distinct roles for FucT-VII and CD103. We show that FucT-VII is required for skin access 
and the establishment of TRM cells, but also contributes to lymphoid memory formation. 
Accordingly, FucT-VII loss has been implicated in increased peripheral T cell apoptosis 
(28). In contrast, we show that CD103-deficiency impairs the establishment of skin TRM 
cells without an apparent defect in lymphoid memory. This is consistent with a requirement 
for CD103 in resident memory formation during skin viral infection (15). However, we 
further highlight CD103 as a mediator of early CD8 T cell accumulation in skin, suggesting 
its potential role in promoting TRM precursor cell access to skin. The specific mechanisms 
whereby CD103-dependent TRM cells mediate anti-tumor immunity remain to be defined, 
although recent studies show that human CD103+ TRM cells are superior to their CD103− 
counterparts in production of IFN-γ and TNF-α (29). While we demonstrate a vital 
requirement for CD103-dependent TRM cells in mediating anti-tumor immunity, their role in

 mediating vitiligo was less apparent, indicating distinct roles for CD103-dependent TRM 
cells in mediating anti-tumor immunity and autoimmunity.
There remain several limitations to the present work. First, our studies do not differentiate 
what characteristics of the primary tumor itself are required for TRM cell programming. One 
could speculate that dermal melanomas direct T cell homing to skin, and that tumor-derived 
TGF-β induces CD103 expression on TRM cell precursors, however this remains to be 
determined. Second, the properties of autoimmune disease that promote TRM cell responses 
are not yet fully understood, as we have not directly demonstrated a requirement for 
melanocyte killing as opposed to some other inflammatory aspect of autoimmunity in skin. 
Further, while we show that CD4 T cell-mediated vitiligo promotes CD8 TRM cell 
responses, our results do not exclude a role for CD4 T cells in directly providing help to 
CD8 TRM cells. Finally, our studies do not address the mechanism whereby vitiligo-affected 
mice also maintain protection against intravenously-inoculated melanoma lung metastases 
(11). Additional studies are needed to determine whether TRM responses are also established 
in lungs of mice with vitiligo. Indeed precedence exists for the simultaneous generation of 
protective skin and lung TRM populations following viral skin infection (5).
The critical role for melanoma-specific TRM cells in tumor protection supports the induction 
of resident memory as a worthwhile goal for cancer immunotherapies. Forced expression of 
key surface molecules, such as CD103 and CLA, could potentially generate therapeutic T 
cells that reside in peripheral tissues. Our work underscores the equally important goal of 
generating a hospitable host environment for TRM cell seeding and maintenance. In future 
work the depletion of Treg cells in conjunction with checkpoint-blockade immunotherapy 
may further improve the host TRM response in skin. Moving forward, T cells resident in 
peripheral tissues should be recognized as a vital component of the immune response to 
cancer.
Materials and Methods
Study design
The research objectives were (1) to characterize the melanoma-specific memory CD8 TRM 
cell response in skin of mice with melanoma-associated vitiligo, and (2) to determine how 
TRM cells contribute to long-lived anti-melanoma immunity. Experiments were performed 
using tissues from mice with vitiligo, as indicated, with cell characterization by flow 
cytometry or immunohistochemistry, in vitro peptide re-stimulation, grafting of skin, 
treatment with FTY720, or tracking of vitiligo or tumor growth. Mice were randomly 
distributed between experimental groups without blinding. Sample sizes and endpoints were 
based on prior published studies to detect similar biological effects (11) and were selected 
prior to each experiment. All assessed samples, including outliers, were included in 
analyses. Detailed descriptions of experimental parameters and data analysis can be found in 
figure legends and the following paragraphs. Primary source data are in Table S1.

 Mice and tumor cells
C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. All transgenic and 
knockout mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and bred in-house (see 
Supplementary Materials and Methods), with the exception of Pmel-1 mice (22) on a Thy1.1 
congenic background, which were a gift from Nicholas Restifo (NCI), and TRP-1 TCR 
transgenic mice (referred to as TRP-1 Tg), carried on a RAG−/− TRP-1−/− background (30), 
which were a gift from Paul Antony (U of Maryland). Female and male mice were used, 
with individual experiments using mice of a single gender, enrolled at 6–8 weeks of age. 
B16 melanoma, B16-OVA, and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cell lines were validated as 
described in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Depleting antibodies and peptides
Depleting anti-CD4 (mAb clone GK1.5) and anti-CD8 (mAb clone 2.43) were produced as 
bioreactor supernatants from hybridoma cell lines (American Type Culture Collection) and 
administered 250 μg/dose, i.p. Peptides (>80% purity) were obtained from New England 
Peptide: human gp10025–33 (KVPRNQDWL), OVA257–264 (SIINFEKL), and mouse 
TRP-2180–188 (SVYDFFVWL).
Induction of melanoma-associated vitiligo
As previously described (21, 23), mice were inoculated i.d. on the right flank with 1.75 × 
105 B16 cells (or 5×105 B16-OVA cells, where indicated) on d0, and treated with anti-CD4 
mAb i.p. on d4 and 10. Tumors were surgically excised on d12. Spontaneous metastases 
were not observed with this B16 subline, and mice with recurrent primary tumors after 
surgery (<5%) were removed from the study.
Pmel and OT-I T cell adoptive transfer
Naïve TCR transgenic T cells (CD8+Thy1.1+ pmel cells or CD8+Ly5.1+ OT-I cells) were 
magnetically sorted by anti-CD44-PE negative selection followed by CD8 positive selection 
(Miltenyi). T cells were transferred i.v. at 104 cells/mouse, one day prior to induction of 
melanoma-associated vitiligo as described above. Where indicated, Ly5.1+ pmel cells were 
admixed at a 1:1 ratio with Thy1.1+ FucT-VII−/− or CD103−/− pmel cells (see 
Supplementary Materials and Methods) prior to transfer.
Tissue processing and flow cytometry
Lymphoid tissues were mechanically dissociated. Skin was minced and incubated in 3 
mg/mL collagenase Type IV (Worthington Biochemical Corporation) and 2 mg/mL DNase 
(Sigma-Aldrich) in HBSS at 37 °C for 45 minutes with stirring. Unless otherwise indicated 
for vitiligo-affected skin, a 2 cm2 patch of perilesional or depigmented skin from the right 
flank was used. Single cells suspensions were stained with antibody clones specified in 
Supplementary Materials and Methods. Flow cytometry was performed on a MACSQuant 
10 Analyzer (Miltenyi), and data were analyzed using FlowJo software V6 (Tree Star). 
Where given, MFI is the geometric mean of fluorescence intensity. Isotype controls and 
representative gating strategies are shown in Figures S12 and S13, respectively; absolute cell 
counts for histogram overlays are provided in Table S1.

 Detection of intracellular IFN-γ
Skin was digested as above, and subjected to a percoll gradient. Cells were incubated for 5–
14h at 37 °C in RPMI containing MHC I-restricted peptides (1 μg/mL; sequences given 
above), IL-2 (10 U/mL), and brefeldin A (10 μg/mL). Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and 
stained for IFN-γ, followed by flow cytometry as described above.
Immunohistochemistry and fluorescence microscopy
Paraformaldehyde-fixed sections of skin were blocked with 5% BSA, 1% goat serum, 1% rat 
serum and 1% donkey serum for 1h followed by staining with combinations of Anti-CD8-
AF594 (clone 53-6.7), -Thy1.1-AF647 (clone OX7), and mouse E cadherin-AF488 (clone 
DEMA-1), and DAPI (representative control staining in Fig. S14). Sections were analyzed 
with a Zeiss AX10 fluorescence microscope fitted with a CoolSnap HQ2 mono14-bit 
camera, using an ×10 Apo objective. Images were taken with ZEN Pro 2012 (Zeiss) 
software and processed with Fiji software. White hairs were distinguished from black hairs 
in bright field images as hairs lacking black striations.
Skin grafting
Fifty days after surgery, pmel cell-adoptively transferred mice with melanoma-associated 
vitiligo were used as donors of 2 cm2 patches of skin. Donor skin was harvested proximal to 
the healed tumor excision site, and was grafted onto RAG−/− recipient mice. 50d later, skin 
grafts were harvested for flow cytometry. Skin from mice in the original donor group (100d 
post-tumor excision) was used as a positive control.
FTY720 treatment
Mice received daily i.p. injections of FTY720 (2-amino-2-(2[4-octylphenyl]ethyl)-1,3-
propanediol hydrochloride, Cayman Chemical), 1mg/kg, beginning 30d post-surgery.
Adoptive transfer of tumor-primed pmel cells
Donor mice received Thy1.1+ pmel cells (d-1), B16 tumors (d0), and anti-CD4 (d4 and 10), 
as described above. On d12, spleens and lymph nodes were pooled from 10–12 mice/group. 
CD8 T cells (containing tumor-primed pmel cells (11, 21)) were isolated by magnetic 
selection (Miltenyi) and transferred i.v. into recipients that had previously been induced to 
develop vitiligo. Wild-type recipients had received B16 tumors, anti-CD4 mAb, and surgery, 
to induce melanoma-associated vitiligo. RAG−/− mice had received 4.5×104 naïve transgenic 
CD4 T cells from TRP-1 Tg mice, followed by sham skin surgery 1 day later. Thirty days 
after transfer of tumor-primed pmel cells, skin of recipient mice was analyzed by flow 
cytometry.
Reconstitution of RAG−/− and CD8−/− mice
RAG−/− or CD8−/− recipient mice received 8×106 magnetically-isolated CD8 T cells from 
spleens of naïve WT, FucT-VII−/−, or CD103−/− donor mice. One day after transfer, 
melanoma-associated vitiligo was induced in recipient mice.

 Tumor challenge
In mice with melanoma-associated vitiligo, 1.2×105 B16 cells or 1.2×105 LLC cells were 
inoculated i.d. ≥30 days after surgical excision of primary tumors. Cells were inoculated on 
flanks contralateral to surgical sites, unless otherwise indicated. Tumors were measured 
thrice weekly, starting on d6, and mice were euthanized at a tumor diameter of 20 mm.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software 
Inc). Data were tested for Gaussian distribution using the D’Agostino and Pearson omnibus 
normality test. When normally distributed, statistical differences were analyzed with 
unpaired t-test for comparing two groups from separate mice, paired t-test for comparing 
two groups from the same mouse, or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with 
Bonferroni posttest for comparing multiple groups. When not normally distributed, the 
Mann-Whitney test was used to compare two unrelated groups, the Wilcoxon matched pairs 
test to compare two groups from the same mouse, and the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunns 
posttest to compare multiple groups. Differences in tumor incidence were assessed using the 
Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon method (hazard ratios not proportional), tumor growth differences 
were assessed by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni posttest, and differences in vitiligo 
incidence were assessed by log-rank test. t tests were two-sided, and a significance level of 
0.05 was used for analyses.

 Editor’s summary
Resident memory to cancer
Melanoma patients with vitiligo are more likely to have a positive outcome, but the 
mechanism behind this association has remained unclear. Now Malik et al. report that 
skin-resident memory T (TRM) cells specific to melanoma antigens are maintained in 
vitiligo-affected skin. These cells persist and function independently of the lymphoid 
compartment, suggesting the vitiligo lesions provide a niche for the TRM cells. The TRM 
cells provide durable memory to the tumor, even in pigmented skin. These data suggest 
that skin-resident TRM cells are critical for maintaining anti-tumor immunity.

day of surgery, (G) lymph nodes 4d prior to surgery, (H) lymph nodes of vitiligo-affected 
mice 45d post-surgery, and (I) tumors on the day of surgery. (J) Analysis of lymph nodes 
from panel G, to detect IFN-γ production by CD8+Thy1.1+ pmel cells, following 5h ex vivo 
restimulation with cognate (gp10025–33) or irrelevant (OVA) peptide. Symbols represent 
individual mice. (E–I) Significance was determined by Wilcoxon matched pairs test, pairing 
CD103−/− and WT pmel populations in the same mouse (denoted by line-connected points). 
Arrows indicate mean percent difference between WT and CD103−/− pmel population sizes. 
Data are pooled from 2 independent experiments, each with n ≥ 3 mice/group, with the 
exception of G, which is representative of 3 experiments each with n ≥ mice/group. (J) 
Significance was determined by Kruskal-Wallis test; data are representative of 2 independent 
experiments each with n = 4 mice/group. NS denotes p > 0.05.

 Figure 7. CD103+ CD8 TRM cells are required for long-lived tumor protection
Mice were treated as in Fig. 1A, and those that developed vitiligo (right flank) were re-
challenged in pigmented skin on the left flank by inoculation with 1.2×105 B16 cells 30d 
post-surgery. (A) Tumor incidence (left) and average diameter of palpable tumors (right) in 
CD8−/− mice that had been reconstituted with either WT or CD103−/− naïve CD8 T cells. 
Naïve denotes untreated wild-type mice. Data are pooled from 2 independent experiments 
with n ≥ 8 mice group. B) Tumor incidence (left) and average diameter of palpable tumors 
(right) in vitiligo-affected mice that were either untreated, or treated with FTY720 +/− anti-
CD8 mAb. FTY720 was given daily starting 14 days prior to tumor challenge and 
continuing to the end of the experiment. Anti-CD8 was given 1d prior to tumor challenge 
and weekly thereafter. (Left) data are pooled from 2 independent experiments with n ≥21 
mice/group; (right) data are representative of 2 experiments with n ≥10 mice/group. 
Significance was determined by Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon analysis (left panels), or two-way 
ANOVA (right panels; tumor diameter given as mean +/− SEM).
