Forecasting the care needs of the older population in England 
over the next 20 years: estimates from the Population Ageing 
and Care Simulation (PACSim) modelling study
Andrew Kingston, Adelina Comas-Herrera, Carol Jagger for the MODEM project*
Summary
Background Existing models for forecasting future care needs are limited in the risk factors included and in the 
assumptions made about incoming cohorts. We estimated the numbers of people aged 65 years or older in England 
and the years lived in older age requiring care at different intensities between 2015 and 2035 from the Population 
Ageing and Care Simulation (PACSim) model.
Methods PACSim, a dynamic microsimulation model, combined three studies (Understanding Society, the English 
Longitudinal Study of Ageing, and the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study II) to simulate individuals’ 
sociodemographic factors, health behaviours, 12 chronic diseases and geriatric conditions, and dependency 
(categorised as high [24-h care], medium [daily care], or low [less than daily] dependency; or independent). Transition 
probabilities for each characteristic were estimated by modelling state changes from baseline to 2-year follow-up. 
Years in dependency states were calculated by Sullivan’s method.
Findings Between 2015 and 2035 in England, both the prevalence of and numbers of people with dependency will fall 
for young-old adults (65–74 years). For very old adults (≥85 years), numbers with low dependency will increase by 
148·0% (range from ten simulations 140·0–152·0) and with high dependency will almost double (increase of 91·8%, 
range 87·3–94·1) although prevalence will change little. Older adults with medium or high dependency and dementia 
will be more likely to have at least two other concurrent conditions (increasing from 58·8% in 2015 to 81·2% in 2035). 
Men aged 65 years will see a compression of dependency with 4·2 years (range 3·9–4·2) of independence gained 
compared with life expectancy gains of 3·5 years (3·1–4·1). Women aged 65 years will experience an expansion of 
mainly low dependency, with 3·0 years (3·0–3·6) gained in life expectancy compared with 1·4 years (1·2–1·4) with 
low dependency and 0·7 years (0·6–0·8) with high dependency.
Interpretation In the next 20 years, the English population aged 65 years or over will see increases in the number of 
individuals who are independent but also in those with complex care needs. This increase is due to more individuals 
reaching 85 years or older who have higher levels of dependency, dementia, and comorbidity. Health and social care 
services must adapt to the complex care needs of an increasing older population.

Introduction
The world’s population is ageing, and many countries 
are finding the consequent demand on health-care 
services to be a challenge. Social care needs of older 
people (ie, aged ≥65 years) are driven by their inability to 
self-care and live independently, most often assessed by 
needing help to undertake one or more basic activities of 
daily living (ADLs) such as bathing, dressing, or 
toileting. Explicitly taking account of cognitive status 
and incontinence, both strong predictors of admission 
to long-term care, produces a more nuanced measure of 
dependency,1 and one that is closer to the WHO’s 
concept of intrinsic capacity.2 Past trends in this 
dependency measure for the UK between 1991 and 2011 
suggest increases in both low dependency (care required 
less than daily), from 28·7% to 32·4%, and high 
dependency (24-h care), from 3·9% to 5·9%.3 These are 
consistent with trends in disability-free life expectancy 
(as measured through ADLs) in both the UK4 and the 
USA,5 both of which reveal an expansion of mild 
disability for women. 
Forecasts of care needs or dependency are often inferred 
from moderate or severe disability, even though 
considerable differences in the intensity of care are 
required across this range, or by using administrative data 
on care receipt, which measures demand rather than need. 
Additionally, models often fail to include risk factors other 
than sex, race, or education, and rarely include more than a 
few diseases, despite disability often being a consequence 
of multimorbidity6 and despite the numbers of older people 
with four or more diseases being projected to more than 
double between 2015 and 2035.7 A further limitation is that 
models have to make assumptions about the disability 
prevalence of younger cohorts ageing into the older

population—generally that prevalence is similar to that of 
earlier cohorts—thereby ignoring differences in risk factors 
such as dementia, cognitive impairment, and other 
disabling conditions and in lifestyle and sociodemographic 
factors. Some of these risk factors have changed positively 
(dementia)8,9 whereas others have changed negatively 
(obesity),10 and evidence suggests that the prevalence of 
multimorbidity in younger cohorts entering the older 
population will rise with each successive cohort.7
In England, there is an ongoing debate as to the level of 
funding for an individual’s care that should be provided 
by the state. Crucial to this debate is how care needs are 
likely to change for future cohorts of older people, in 
order to plan for and resource appropriate services to 
meet demand. We report results from a dynamic 
microsimulation model, the Population Ageing and Care 
Simulation (PACSim), to address many of the limitations 
of previous models, with the aim to provide the first 
estimates of future levels of dependency for the English 
population aged 65 years or older from 2015 to 2035, 
accounting for differences in disease and risk factor 
profiles of younger cohorts ageing into future older 
populations.
Methods 
Model
We used PACSim to estimate the numbers with, 
prevalence of, and years lived with varying levels of 
dependency for the population aged 65 years or older in 
England from 2015 to 2035. Full details of the architecture 
of PACSim are available elsewhere;11 in brief, PACSim is 
a discrete-time dynamic microsimulation model that 
simulates characteristics (sociodemographic, health 
behaviours, chronic diseases, geriatric conditions, and 
dependency) of individuals. Broadly, PACSim is in 
two parts: creation of the base population and simulation 
of the ageing of individuals.
Base population
To create the base population for PACSim, we pooled 
individuals aged 35 years or older from three longitudinal 
studies: Understanding Society wave 1 (n=27 293), the 
English 
Longitudinal 
Study 
of 
Ageing 
(ELSA) 
wave 5 (n=8744), and the Cognitive Function and Ageing 
Study II (CFAS II; n=5286), thereby ensuring a nationally 
representative sample of individuals who would age into 
the older population (≥65 years) and maximising the 
strengths and minimising the limitations of any one study 
in terms of the measured characteristics. Limitations of 
each study in terms of the characteristics are given 
elsewhere,11 and baseline characteristics available for all 
studies (by age group and study) are shown graphically in 
the appendix (pp 18–21). The study-specific sample weights 
were used to adjust for differential non-response or low 
response and then the pooled dataset was reweighted up to 
the English population in 2014 (the base of the projections), 
cloned so that all individuals had unit weights, and a 1% 
random sample taken to ease computing power and time. 
This formed the base population for PACSim (n=303 588).
With the exception of dementia, chronic diseases 
(coronary heart disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, 
arthritis, cancer, respiratory disease, and depression) were 
self-report of doctor diagnoses. Vision and hearing 
impairments were self-report of current condition 
and cognition status was defined by the Mini-Mental 
State Examination (MMSE) score,12 categorised as 0–9 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Between Jan 1 and Jan 15, 2018, we searched MEDLINE and Web 
of Science for worldwide studies published in English from 
inception up to the date of the search forecasting future disability 
or care needs with the search terms “disability”, “life expectancy”, 
“longevity”, “forecast”, and “simulation”. The complete search 
strings and a review of the simulation models found are given in 
the appendix. We identified five dynamic microsimulation 
models, four studies forecasting disability, and one on use of 
social care. Only one of the studies reported years with care needs 
(inferred from disability) for England, and this study included only 
two chronic conditions (cardiovascular disease and dementia) as 
risk factors for disability.
Added value of this study
The Population Ageing and Care Simulation (PACSim) model is 
the first dynamic microsimulation model forecasting 
dependency profiles of future older populations for England 
based on longitudinal data from three nationally representative 
studies of adults aged 35 years or older and accounting for a 
wide range of sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and 
chronic conditions, as well as the real risk factor profiles of new 
entrants into the older population. We find that, over the next 
20 years, absolute numbers of people aged 65 years or older 
with high dependency will increase by 36%. By 2035, most 
(80%) older people with medium or high dependency and 
dementia will also have two or more other diseases. Trends for 
men and women will differ markedly, with men aged 65 years 
seeing a compression in years lived with dependency whereas 
women will see an expansion of years lived with low and high 
dependency.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our projections highlight the importance of ensuring that 
health and social care services adapt so that they can 
adequately respond to the needs of an increasing older 
population with complex care needs; notably, this increase will 
probably be accompanied by a reduction in care provision by 
adult children as the retirement age is extended and an increase 
in older spouse carers who will be increasingly living with 
disabilities and multiple conditions.

(severe cognitive impairment), 10–20 (moderate cognitive 
impairment), 21–26 (mild cognitive impairment), or 27–30 
(normal cognition). Dementia status was only available in 
CFAS II participants; for the remainder, dementia status 
was allocated probabilistically and outside of the 
simulation, conditional on age group, MMSE category, 
and community or care home residence. Full details of 
data harmonisation and imputation of missing values are 
given elsewhere.11
To measure dependency, we used the so-called interval of 
need developed by Isaacs and Neville.1 This method 
categorises individuals according to the frequency with 
which they need care: high dependency (needs 24-h care), 
medium dependency (needs help at regular times daily), 
low dependency (needs help less than daily), or 
independent (free from care). For ELSA and CFAS II, 
interval-of-need categories were constructed according to 
the need for help with basic and instrumental ADLs, 
cognitive impairment, and continence status (table 1); 
there were no comparable items to define dependency in 
the Understanding Society study and therefore the interval 
of need was imputed using the chained equations method13 
on the basis of age, sex, and education. Further details of 
the interval-of-need classification are available elsewhere.11
Simulation 
Each characteristic for an individual was updated 
monthly (over the period January, 2014, to December, 
2042) if the probability of transition from the current 
value of the characteristic exceeded a randomly 
generated uniformly distributed variable. Transition 
probabilities for each stochastic characteristic (all except 
age, sex, education, and occupation) were calculated 
from fitting generalised linear models to the baseline 
and subsequent 2-year follow-up from the three studies 
pooled. All models used study-specific weights to adjust 
for non-response and sampling strategy. We included 
age and sex in all transition models and then included 
known risk factors for that characteristic, retaining those 
that were significantly associated with the transition; for 
dependency, we included disease and sociodemographic 
risk factors identified in two systematic reviews.14,15 The 
transition probabilities were converted to monthly 
probabilities to achieve a more realistic modelling of 
characteristics that jointly influence each other. To 
account for cognitive impairment being included in the 
interval of need and being an explanatory factor for 
transitions, we modelled transitions for physical 
dependency (without cognitive impairment) and then 
combined this outcome with cognitive impairment to 
produce an interval of need at the end of each simulation. 
For low, medium, and high physical dependency; mild 
and moderate cognitive impairment; depression; and 
visual and hearing impairment, we also modelled 
recovery to the next less severe category. Details of the 
explanatory factors included in each transition model 
are provided in the appendix and elsewhere;11 dementia 
was excluded as an explanatory variable because it was 
allocated after the simulation. Death was simulated from 
monthly survival probabilities derived from the annual 
probabilities of all-cause mortality underlying the 
2014-based principal popu 
lation projection for England.16
Model validation
PACSim well represented the time trends in the numbers 
of older people within broad age groups (65–74 years, 
75–84 years, and ≥85 years) from the 2014 population 
projections (appendix). Validation against external data 
sources was difficult because the base population of 
PACSim included all the major national longitudinal 
studies. However, there was generally good agreement 
between the age-specific and sex-specific prevalence of 
stroke, diabetes, current smoking, overweight, and obesity 
from PACSim and those from the Health Survey for 
England 2014,17 apart from the prevalence of obesity, which 
PACSim underestimated by around 8 percentage points 
for men aged 35–64 years and for women of all ages.

examine the impact of dementia and multimorbidity 
(defined as two or more chronic conditions) on absolute 
numbers and prevalence estimates. Years with and 
without dependency at age 65 years for men and women 
were calculated for each year by Sullivan’s method,18 
applying the age-sex-specific prevalence of dependency to 
the age-sex-specific lifetable population generated from 
the survival probabilities. We present results from the 
first run of PACSim over the time period 2014–35 along 
with the range of values from ten repeated simulations.
Data harmonisation for the three studies was 
undertaken in Stata version 12.1 and PACSim was 
implemented in SAS version 9.4.
Role of the funding source 
This work forms part of the MODEM project. No 
funding body has had any influence over the design of 
PACSim; the collection, analysis or interpretation of 
data; or the writing of the report. The corresponding 
author had full access to all data in the study and had 
final responsibility for the decision to submit for 
publication.
Results
Between 2015 and 2035, the absolute numbers of people 
aged 65 years or older in England will increase by 48·6% 
while the numbers living independently will increase by 
61·0% overall and by more than 50% across all age 
groups, with the largest increase being in the very old 
(age ≥85 years; table 2). For the young-old (aged 
65–74 years), both the numbers with and the prevalence 
of all levels of dependency will fall (table 2; appendix p 4). 
For the very old, numbers with low dependency will 
more than double and numbers with high dependency 
will almost double (table 2) owing to population increase 
in that age group, although dependency prevalence will 
change little.
The next 20 years show considerable differences by sex 
in the change in numbers of dependent older men and 
women and the prevalence of dependency (figure 1; 
appendix pp 5–7). In 2015, profiles of dependency in 
young-old men and women are similar, but by 2035, the 
proportion of young-old men who are independent will 
rise by almost 20 percentage points (from 70·5% to 
89·1%), whereas the proportion of young-old women who 
are independent will increase by only around 6 percentage 
points (from 68·1% to 73·6%; figure 1). In the very old, the 
proportion with low dependency will rise between 2015 
and 2035 for both men (from 42·1% to 51·1%) and women 
(from 49·7% to 57·2%), although in men this increase is 
mostly offset by a reduction in medium dependency (from 
13·8% to 9·4%), whereas in women it is offset by a lower 
proportion being independent (from 17·8% to 11·5%; 
figure 1; appendix p 7).

The sex differences in dependency over time are seen 
more clearly by examining the proportion of each 5-year 
birth cohort who remain independent as they age 
(figure 2). Three phenomena are apparent. First, more 
recent male birth cohorts enter the older population 
successively more independent than prior cohorts. 
Second, these improvements in independence do not 
carry through as the male cohorts age, because the 
proportion of each cohort that is still independent by age 
85 years or older is close to 30% regardless of birth 
cohort. Finally, the male cohort aged 65–69 years in 2015 
(ie, those born in 1946–50) exhibits evidence of recovery 
of independence in the next 5 years, with the proportion 
who are independent at age 70–74 years in 2020 being 
higher than that for the same individuals at age 
65–69 years in 2015; this is also true for the 70–74 year 
olds in 2015 (ie, those born in 1941–45) when they become 
75–79 years of age in 2020. More recent male birth 
cohorts show no evidence of recovery. These phenomena 
are not evident for women, whose profile of dependency 
for incoming cohorts varies little and who always have a 
lower probability of recovery (figure 2). The proportions 
with low, medium, and high dependency by birth cohort 
are provided in the appendix (pp 12–14).
Because care needs are greatest for those with 
substantial (ie, moderate or high) dependency, we 
examined how the burden of dementia with and without 
other comorbidity would change over the next 20 years. 
Between 2015 and 2025, the composition of the older 
population with substantial dependency will change 
markedly; numbers of older adults with dementia alone 
will reduce by 31·1%, then remain stable up to 2035, 
whereas numbers of those with dementia and two or 
more other comorbidities will more than double by 2025 
and then increase further by 2035 (table 3). Thus, by 2035, 
81·2% of substantially dependent older adults with 
dementia will also have two or more other conditions, 
compared with 58·8% in 2015 (appendix p 9). Trends in 
multimorbidity in individuals with substantial dependency 
but without dementia are in the same direction but less 
extreme. The distributions of comorbidity in those with 
substantial dependency with and without dementia were 
similar by sex although absolute numbers were greater for 
women than for men in all categories (appendix pp 9–11).
Life expectancy at age 65 years for men in England will 
increase between 2015 and 2035 by 3·5 years, with a gain 
in years independent of 4·2 years and a reduction in 
years with medium dependency of 0·4 years and in years 
of high dependency of 0·3 years (table 4). An absolute 
compression in the number of years lived dependent for 
men aged 65 years will therefore occur, with the 
proportion of life spent independent increasing to 2025 
then decreasing slightly to 2035. However, women’s life 
expectancy at age 65 years will increase less than for 
men, with almost half of this increase with low 
dependency and increases of 0·9 years independent and 
0·7 years with high dependency (table 4). The proportion 
of life spent with any level of dependency changes by less 
than 2 percentage points for women over the whole 
period (table 4).
Discussion
We report the first forecasts of levels of dependency in 
adults aged 65 years or older in England that include the 
sociodemographic and disease profiles for cohorts 
becoming 65 years of age over the period 2015–35. Our 
overall findings are that the proportion of independent 
older people will increase between 2015 and 2035 
although absolute numbers with low or high dependency 
will still rise by around a third. However, trends for men 
and women will be very different. Over the period 
studied, men (aged 65–74 years) will be successively 
more independent when they enter the older population, 
with the proportion independent increasing by almost 
20 percentage points between 2015 and 2035. 
Nevertheless, the improved dependency is not sustained, 
and once they reach 85 years of age or older they are 
indistinguishable from earlier cohorts. Young-old 
women (aged 65–74 years) will also see an increase in 
the proportion independent, but only by around

6 percentage points, and with almost no change in 
profiles of dependency between 2025 and 2035. Men 
aged 65 years will experience a real compression of 
dependency, with years of independence gained 
exceeding the gain in life expectancy. Women, on the 
other hand, will have most of the gain in life expectancy 
in years with low dependency, and with a small increase 
in years with high dependency, identical to trends over 
the previous two decades.3
Dementia incidence and prevalence have fallen over 
the past decades in the UK and the USA,8,9 but projections 
suggest that dementia prevalence will rise owing to 
longer survival and the increasing numbers of the very 
old.7,19 Due to the growth in the numbers of very old 
adults and the greater prevalence of multimorbidity in 
this age group, most older adults with medium or high 
dependency and dementia in 2035 will also have other 
comorbidities. This group is likely to have more complex 
care needs that are unlikely to be met adequately without 
improved coordination between different specialities and 
without improved recognition of the way in which a 
diagnosis of dementia affects the management of other 
long-term conditions.20
The need to inform policy and resource allocation for 
care of future older populations is evident from other 
dynamic microsimulation models for England, Japan, 
New Zealand, the USA, and Canada (see appendix 
[pp 23–25] for a review of simulation models). PACSim 
addresses the limitations of previous microsimulation 
models: care needs inferred only from ADL disability,21–23 
use of social care,24 or a combination;25 assumptions 
about risk factor and dependency profiles for new 
entrants to the older population rather than inclusion of 
real individuals as they age into the older population;21,22,24,25

and chronic conditions that impact disability and 
dependency;22–25 and the inability to observe the joint 
effect of diseases or multimorbidity. These differences 
between models are illustrated by comparison of our 
findings with those of the previous model for England, 
IMPACT-BAM,22 based on one of the studies (ELSA) 
included in PACSim. IMPACT-BAM reports a greater 
increase in years with disability for men than for women 
between 2015 and 2025. By contrast, PACSim forecasts a 
reduction in years of dependence (all levels) for men 
over the same period, although the disability and 
dependency measures are not directly comparable, the 
latter including cognitive impairment and instrumental 
ADLs, which provide a wider spectrum of functional 
limitation. Other strengths of PACSim are the use of 
three large, nationally representative surveys as its base 
population, with the baseline disease prevalence broadly 
comparable with the Health Survey for England 2014;17 
incorporation of level of education, which has 
increased—and will continue to increase for some 
time—in the older population; and performing the 
simulation on a monthly schedule, thus providing a 
more realistic evolution of individual characteristics that 
are co-dependent and the ability to transition rapidly

through the severity of dependency. Limitations to our 
study concern the assumptions inherent in PACSim: 
that the transition models remain constant over time, 
although the transition proba 
bilities will change over 
time if the risk factor profile of cohorts change and these 
can be further modified through exploring different 
scenarios; that the ADLs, cognitive status, and 
incontinence defining dependency levels will do so in 
the same way over the next 20 years, which might not be 
the case because technological advances might replace 
carer intervention; and omission of other risk factors 
such as alcohol use.
Several diseases that increase the risk of dependency 
share obesity as an underlying risk factor. Worldwide, 
there have been increasing trends in obesity and 
overweight,26 and halting the rise in obesity and diabetes 
is one of the global targets for non-communicable 
diseases for WHO.27 However, other risk factors for 
dependency have improved over past decades with 
reductions in stroke incidence28 and in dementia 
prevalence9 reported in the USA and reductions in 
dementia incidence reported in the UK.8 Nevertheless, 
even with reductions in incidence or prevalence of 
chronic conditions, the ageing of the population means 
a substantial increase in the number of older people 
with long-term conditions and with multiple concurrent 
conditions because multimorbidity is the norm for very 
old people, who are the fastest growing demographic;29 
however, population ageing might explain only up to 
half of past rises in multimorbidity prevalence.30 In the 
future, although young-old cohorts are more likely to 
enter old age independent, the proportion of the 
population who are multimorbid is forecast to rise with 
each successive cohort,7 and these result in a lower 
likelihood of recovery of independence, particularly in 
men, and therefore a greater likelihood of higher 
dependency with further ageing.
Our forecasts highlight the importance of ensuring that 
health and social care services adapt so that they can 
adequately respond to the needs of an increasing older 
population with complex care needs.2 The rise in care 
needs we have forecast contrasts with other trends that 
suggest that relying on families and other unpaid carers 
more than done so currently does not appear to be a 
sustainable solution. The supply of unpaid care to older 
people by their adult children in England is unlikely to 
keep pace with demand,31 whereas care provision by 
spouses is growing and is projected to continue to 
increase in importance.32 Older spouse carers are 
increasingly likely to be living with disabilities themselves, 
resulting in mutual care relationships33 that are not yet 
well recognised by existing care policy and practices. 
Extending the retirement age of the UK population is 
likely to further reduce the informal and unpaid carer 
pool, who have traditionally provided for older family 
members, and so shift this responsibility to the state.34 
These forces will unite to add further stress to social care 
budgets that help people to maintain independence 
within the community or fund long-term care needs.
