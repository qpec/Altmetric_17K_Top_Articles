IMPORTANCE Emergency general surgery (EGS) represents 11% of surgical admissions and
50% of surgical mortality in the United States. However, there is currently no established
definition of the EGS procedures.
OBJECTIVE To define a set of procedures accounting for at least 80% of the national burden
of operative EGS.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective review was conducted using data from
the 2008-2011 National Inpatient Sample. Adults (age, �18 years) with primary EGS
diagnoses consistent with the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma definition,
admitted urgently or emergently, who underwent an operative procedure within 2 days of
admission were included in the analyses. Procedures were ranked to account for national
mortality and complication burden. Among ranked procedures, contributions to total EGS
frequency, mortality, and hospital costs were assessed. The data query and analysis were
performed between November 15, 2015, and February 16, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Overall procedure frequency, in-hospital mortality, major
complications, and inpatient costs calculated per 3-digit International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification procedure codes.
RESULTS The study identified 421 476 patient encounters associated with operative EGS,
weighted to represent 2.1 million nationally over the 4-year study period. The overall
mortality rate was 1.23% (95% CI, 1.18%-1.28%), the complication rate was 15.0% (95% CI,
14.6%-15.3%), and mean cost per admission was $13 241 (95% CI, $12 957-$13 525). After
ranking the 35 procedure groups by contribution to EGS mortality and morbidity burden,
a final set of 7 operative EGS procedures were identified, which collectively accounted for
80.0% of procedures, 80.3% of deaths, 78.9% of complications, and 80.2% of inpatient
costs nationwide. These 7 procedures included partial colectomy, small-bowel resection,
cholecystectomy, operative management of peptic ulcer disease, lysis of peritoneal
adhesions, appendectomy, and laparotomy.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Only 7 procedures account for most admissions, deaths,
complications, and inpatient costs attributable to the 512 079 EGS procedures performed in
the United States each year. National quality benchmarks and cost reduction efforts should
focus on these common, complicated, and costly EGS procedures.

E
mergency general surgery (EGS) encompasses the care
ofthemostacutelyill,highestrisk,andmostcostlygen-
eral surgery patients.1-5 There are more than 3 million
patients admitted to US hospitals each year for EGS diagno-
ses, more than the sum of all new cancer diagnoses.1-5 This is
a particularly high-risk population of surgery patients—those
who undergo an EGS operation are up to 8 times more likely
to die postoperatively than are patients undergoing the same
procedures electively.2 In addition, approximately half of all
patients undergoing EGS will develop a postoperative
complication,2,4,6 and up to 15% will be readmitted to the hos-
pital within 30 days of their surgery.3 Despite the inordinate
burdenofEGSamongoperativesurgicalpatients,toourknowl-
edge, surgical benchmarks do not exist for EGS procedures.
Earlier efforts to define the scope of EGS have used vari-
ousdatasources:billingdataandrelativevalueunits7fromEGS
surgeons, Current Procedural Terminology codes of acute care
surgery fellows,8 and single-institution assessments.9 In 2013,
the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST)
Committee on Severity Assessment and Patient Outcomes ad-
dressed this issue by publishing a landmark list10 of 621 Inter-
nationalClassificationofDiseases,NinthRevision,ClinicalModi-
fication (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes.11 This list was created to
include “any patient (inpatient or emergency department) re-
quiring an emergency surgical evaluation (operative or non-
operative) for diseases within the realm of general surgery as
defined by the American Board of Surgery.”10(p1092) A fol-
low-up study proposed 149 ICD-9-CM procedure codes that
were identified as procedures that would or could treat any of
the aforementioned EGS diagnoses.1,12-15 These lists repre-
sent a significant advance toward a unified definition of EGS;
however, the wide clinical heterogeneity limits the ability to
translate these studies to existing surgical benchmarking
efforts.1,10,12-15
To build on this broadly inclusive list of diagnoses that en-
compass operative and nonoperative EGS patients,1,10,16,17 a
more focused, clinically relevant, and nationally representa-
tive list of EGS procedures is needed. The goal of the present
study was to expand the current diagnosis-based definition of
EGS10to define a standardized, representative set of proce-
dures that make up the bulk of the national clinical burden of
EGS. This set will simplify efforts to establish EGS bench-
marks,guidestandardizedandfocusedresearchpriorities,and
inform quality improvement programs. As such, the aim of the
present study was to identify a set of urgent and EGS proce-
dures that account for more than 80% of the national burden
of EGS in terms of frequency, morbidity, mortality, and cost.
Methods
Analytic Sample
FromNovember15,2015,toFebruary16,2016,wequerieddata
from the 2008 to 2011 Hospital Cost and Utilization Project’
s
(HCUP)16 National Inpatient Sample (NIS). The data query was
performedTheNISisthelargestall-payersclaimsdatabasethat
is publicly available in the United States. The NIS sampling
framework consists of a 20% sample of hospitals stratified
based on geographic region, ownership control, urban or ru-
ral location, teaching status, and number of hospital beds. This
framework provides a 90% sample of all hospital discharges
in the United States and includes patient-level and hospital-
level variables, comprising up to 25 diagnosis codes and 15 pro-
cedure codes per patient encounter.11,16 The HCUP-provided
discharge weights are provided annually to allow for nation-
ally representative population weighting of discharges. The
Partners Human Research Committee, the institutional re-
view board of Partners Healthcare, approved this study.
The analytic data set consisted of all patients 18 years or
older who had a principal diagnosis consistent with the AAST
EGS definition based on ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes11,18,19 who
were admitted urgently or emergently or who were admitted
through the emergency department if the admission type
was unknown. The sample was further limited to include
only patients who underwent an operative procedure on the
day of or the day following admission. To focus the analysis
on the scope of practice common to emergency general sur-
geons across a variety of facility types, patients who under-
went primarily obstetric, cardiac, vascular, endovascular, or
endoscopic procedures were excluded. Finally, patients
undergoing very rare procedures were excluded by removing
the bottom 5% of the sample when ranked by procedure
frequency.
Variables
Patient- and facility-level demographic data were derived from
NIS-provided variables and included age, sex, race/ethnicity
(non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, other, and
missing),patientzipcodeincomequartile,insurancepayer(pri-
vate, public, uninsured, and other), US census region (North-
east, Midwest, South, and West), hospital teaching status and
location (urban teaching, urban nonteaching, and rural), and
hospitalbedsize(small,medium,andlarge;actualcutoffsvary
according to urban or rural location and US census region).
The NIS-provided ICD-9-CM procedure codes were ana-
lyzed in their original 4-digit format (NN.nx) as well as col-
lapsed into 3-digit procedure groups (NN.n). This was done to
ensure that similar procedures were clustered together ac-
cording to the preexisting ICD-9-CM hierarchy of procedure
Key Points
Question What procedures account for most of the emergency
general surgery (EGS) burden in the United States?
Findings In this nationally representative observational study
representing more than 2 million patient encounters, 80% of
all operative volume, complications, death, and costs were
attributable to 7 EGS procedures: partial colectomy, small-bowel
resection, cholecystectomy, operative management of peptic
ulcer disease, lysis of peritoneal adhesions, appendectomy, and
laparotomy.
Meaning The 7 procedures identified in this study represent the
greatest clinical EGS burden and may serve as the focus of future
quality and benchmarking efforts to improve operative EGS care
nationwide.

codes and to avoid underestimation or overestimation of pro-
cedural burden owing to an increased or decreased number of
second-order divisions. For example, a right-sided hemico-
lectomy (45.73), a left-sided hemicolectomy (45.75), and a sig-
moid hemicolectomy (45.76) would all be considered partial
colectomies (45.7x). However, these would remain a distinct
procedure group from all variants of total colectomies (45.8x).
Procedure and procedure group counts were based on the
NIS-provided principal procedure code. Mortality rates were
also based on NIS-provided outcome data. Complications were
based on secondary ICD-9-CM codes and included 13 compli-
cation types: pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis and/or pul-
monary embolism, acute renal injury, stroke, myocardial in-
farction, cardiac arrest, acute respiratory distress syndrome,
sepsis, septic shock, mechanical wound failure, wound infec-
tion, postoperative gastrointestinal tract complications, and
other or unspecified postoperative complications including re-
tained foreign body and postoperative hemorrhage.17,20 Each
patient could theoretically have 1 to 13 complications during
an inpatient stay. Complication rate was calculated as a bi-
nary variable, indicating the presence of any complication,
whereasthetotalcomplicationcountwascalculatedasthesum
of all complications by procedure group. The NIS-provided in-
patient hospital charges were converted to estimated costs
using HCUP-provided cost to charge ratios, and these esti-
mates from 2008 to 2011 were normalized to 2015 US dollars
using annual hospital consumer-price indices.1,10,18,19,21
Statistical Analysis
Procedure count, total deaths, total complications, and total
index hospitalization costs were calculated for each 3-digit
ICD-9-CM procedure group included in the final analytic data
set. A mortality score and a complications score were defined
as the product of procedure frequency and mortality rate or
complications rate, respectively. Scores were calculated per
procedure groups and then ranked, such that each 3-digit
ICD-9-CMproceduregroupreceived1mortalityrankand1com-
plication rank. These 2 ranks were then summed to generate
a final burden rank by procedure group.
Once sorted by burden rank, the cumulative attributable
burden was determined regarding the frequency, total deaths,
total complications, and total hospital costs. For procedure
groups ranked 1 to 35, the cumulative attributable burden of
procedure frequency, for example, was calculated as the sum
of the number of procedures ranked 1 to n divided by the total
number of procedures in the entire analytic sample. This mea-
sure is akin to a percentile value for each ranked procedure.
Thecumulativeattributableburdenforfrequency,deaths,com-
plications, and costs was then calculated. For the procedure
group with rank x, the cumulative attributable burden for an
outcome of interest represents the summation of the propor-
tion of total burden for that outcome attributable to proce-
dures ranked 1 through x. A threshold of 80% of the total popu-
lation burden was established as an a priori cutoff to represent
significant representation of population-level burden for each
of the 4 outcomes of interest. Costs were not used to calcu-
late burden scores, but they were reported as an outcome mea-
sure to determine whether highly ranked procedures also ac-
count for significant surgical health care spending. All counts
and means were weighted using NIS-provided population de-
sign-weights generalized with Stata’
s svy command to ac-
count for patient clustering within hospitals and to attain na-
tionallyweightedestimates.Allanalyseswerecompletedusing
Stata, version 13.0 (StataCorp, Inc). Data analysis was con-
ducted from November 15, 2015, to February 16, 2016.
Results
This study identified a sample of more than 3.1 million pa-
tients with an EGS diagnosis (Figure 1) weighted to represent
morethan35.1millionpatientencountersnationallyin4years.
From this sample, 512 079 patients (16.5%) were excluded be-
cause they were not admitted urgently or emergently. An ad-
ditional 1 813 888 patients (58.4%) were excluded because they
did not undergo a major operation during their hospital stay.
Another 319 675 individuals (10.3%) were excluded because
theydidnotundergoanoperativeprocedureonthefirstorsec-
ond day of admission. After excluding a small proportion of
cardiac, vascular, obstetric, endoscopic, nonoperative proce-
dure codes (13 532 [0.4%]), as well as rare procedure codes
(23 532 [0.8%]), the final analytic sample included 421 476 pa-
tient encounters (13.6% of the original sample). This represen-
tative cohort exhibits appropriate patient-level, facility-

level, and geographic diversity (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
This sample included adults of all ages (range, 18-105 years),
was racially/ethnically diverse (61.3% non-Hispanic white,
9.0% non-Hispanic black, and 14.5% Hispanic individuals),
comprised a diverse payer mix (46.1% private, 37.8% public,
and 11.6% uninsured), and had even distribution across all in-
come quartiles (range, 24.6% in quartile 1 to 25.4% in quartile
3). This sample also represented a diverse array of facilities in
which 61.2% were large hospitals and 11.8% were urban teach-
ing hospitals. Applying NIS-provided population weights, the
final analytic sample represented a total of 2.1 million opera-
tivepatientencountersnationwidewithin4years,rangingfrom
502 484 (95% CI, 453 226-551 742) in 2008 to 537 031 (95% CI,
484 819-589 243) in 2009. The mean mortality in the overall
sample was 1.23% (95% CI, 1.18%-1.28%), and 15.0% (95% CI,
14.6%-15.3%) of the patients experienced 1 or more complica-
tion. The mean estimated inpatient hospital cost per admis-
sion was $13 241 (95% CI, $12 957-$13 525). Nationally, the an-
nualestimatedcostrangedfrom$6.1billion(95%CI,$5.5billion
to $6.7 billion) in 2008 to $6.6 billion (95% CI, $6.0 billion to
$7.3 billion) in 2010.
The final analytic sample included 137 unique 4-digit ICD-
9-CM procedure codes, which mapped into 35 distinct 3-digit
procedure group codes. When ordered by burden rank 1 to 35,
the cumulative attributable burden for total procedure count,
total deaths, total complications, and total costs increased
sharply through procedures ranked 1 to 7, but all 4 curves no-
tably flattened thereafter (Figure 2). Each additional proce-
dure increased the cumulative burden (for any of the 4 out-
comes) by a mean of 9% to 12% for the first 7 procedures,
whereas the next 7 procedures increased the cumulative at-
tributable burden by a mean of 2% with each additional pro-
cedure. These first 7 procedure groups accounted for 80.0%
of all procedures, 80.3% of all deaths, 78.9% of all complica-
tions, and 80.2% of all inpatient costs in this nationally rep-
resentative data set (Figure 2). The top 7 procedures included
partial colectomy (ICD-9-CM procedure group 45.7x), small-
bowel resection (group 45.6x), cholecystectomy (group 51.2x),
operative management of peptic ulcer disease (group 44.4x),
lysis of peritoneal adhesions (group 54.5x), appendectomy
(group 47.0x), and laparotomy (group 54.1x) (Table 1). The
top 10 primary diagnosis codes associated with each of these
top-ranked procedures as well as the most common diagno-
ses associated with procedure group 54.1x (laparotomy)
are presented in eTable 2 and eTable 3, respectively, in the
Supplement.
A complete list of procedure frequency, mortality rate,
complication rate, burden ranks, and mean inpatient costs of
all 35 procedure groups is reported in Table 2. Among the top

national benchmarks for EGS.
To our knowledge, this list is the first to be derived from a
nationallyrepresentativedatasetthatincludespatientsofallages,
races/ethnicities, income levels, facility types, and geographic
regions. In addition, ranking by the cross-products of both fre-
quency × mortality rate and frequency × complication rate en-
abledidentificationofproceduresthatarecommon,deadly,and
represent significant morbidity (Figure 2). By excluding proce-
duresthatarenotcommontothescopeofpracticeofallgeneral
surgeonsintheUnitedStates(ie,cardiac,thoracic,vascular,ob-
stetric, and endoscopic), the resultant list represents sufficient
homogeneity that can be interpreted in a clinically meaningful
waythroughoutthecountry.Althoughcostwasnotusedtorank
the procedures, it is notable that the same 7 procedures ranked
by clinical burden also accounted for 80% of all EGS-related
inpatient costs (Figure 2). This finding further emphasizes the
usefulnessofthese7procedurestoserveasthebasisforunder-
standingwaystoimprovequalityandreducecostamongpatients

In 2014, Gale and colleagues1 proposed a list of 149 proce-
dures that could be used to categorize patients with any of the
AAST-definedEGSdiagnoses.However,thislistdoesnottakeinto
account which of these procedures represent the most signifi-
cant proportion of national burden. In addition, the list’
s broad

However, the national representativeness of the NIS facilitates
theidentificationofthehighestburdenproceduresthroughout
theUnitedStates.Futurestudiesarewarrantedtosubsequently
monitor these procedures in prospective clinical-derived data-
bases. Second, the exclusion of nonoperative patients from the
finalanalyticdatasetomitsanimportantcohortthatmaynotre-
quire an operative intervention but may otherwise require the
care of a surgeon. As discussed above, the list provided in this
study is meant to guide benchmarks for operative EGS akin to
those that exist for nonemergent surgery. Analysis of nonoper-
ativecareiswarrantedandimportant,althoughmanydatabases
precludetheabilitytodeterminewhichpatientsreceivecarethat
is managed primarily by surgeons and which receive care that
is managed primarily by nonsurgeons, which may result in dif-
ferences in both quality and costs of care.22 Third, this analysis
was intentionally limited to operative procedures performed
within2daysofadmissionforanEGS-relateddiagnosis.Assuch,
itdoesnotaccountfortheburdenoftrauma-relatedprocedures
or semi-elective procedures that take place many days after ad-
mission. Finally, these findings do not represent other forms of

Conclusions
Analysis of the largest available nationally representative data-
base demonstrates that more than half of a million patients un-
dergo urgent or emergent general surgery operations annually
in the United States that account for more than $6 billion in an-
nualcosts.Only7representativeproceduresaccountforapproxi-
mately80%ofalladmissions,deaths,complications,andinpa-
tient costs attributable to operative EGS nationwide. National
quality benchmarks and cost reduction efforts should focus on
these common, complicated, and costly EGS procedures.
