IMPORTANCE Leisure-time physical activity has been associated with lower risk of
heart-disease and all-cause mortality, but its association with risk of cancer is not well
understood.
OBJECTIVE To determine the association of leisure-time physical activity with incidence of
common types of cancer and whether associations vary by body size and/or smoking.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We pooled data from 12 prospective US and European
cohorts with self-reported physical activity (baseline, 1987-2004). We used multivariable
Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals for associations
of leisure-time physical activity with incidence of 26 types of cancer. Leisure-time physical
activity levels were modeled as cohort-specific percentiles on a continuous basis and cohort-
specific results were synthesized by random-effects meta-analysis. Hazard ratios for high vs
low levels of activity are based on a comparison of risk at the 90th vs 10th percentiles of
activity. The data analysis was performed from January 1, 2014, to June 1, 2015.
EXPOSURES Leisure-time physical activity of a moderate to vigorous intensity.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident cancer during follow-up.
RESULTS A total of 1.44 million participants (median [range] age, 59 [19-98] years; 57%
female) and 186 932 cancers were included. High vs low levels of leisure-time physical activity
were associated with lower risks of 13 cancers: esophageal adenocarcinoma (HR, 0.58; 95%
CI, 0.37-0.89), liver (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.55-0.98), lung (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.71-0.77), kidney
(HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.70-0.85), gastric cardia (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64-0.95), endometrial (HR,
0.79; 95% CI, 0.68-0.92), myeloid leukemia (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70-0.92), myeloma (HR,
0.83; 95% CI, 0.72-0.95), colon (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77-0.91), head and neck (HR, 0.85; 95%
CI, 0.78-0.93), rectal (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80-0.95), bladder (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.82-0.92),
and breast (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87-0.93). Body mass index adjustment modestly attenuated
associations for several cancers, but 10 of 13 inverse associations remained statistically
significant after this adjustment. Leisure-time physical activity was associated with higher
risks of malignant melanoma (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.16-1.40) and prostate cancer (HR, 1.05; 95%
CI, 1.03-1.08). Associations were generally similar between overweight/obese and
normal-weight individuals. Smoking status modified the association for lung cancer but not
other smoking-related cancers.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Leisure-time physical activity was associated with lower risks
of many cancer types. Health care professionals counseling inactive adults should emphasize
that most of these associations were evident regardless of body size or smoking history,
supporting broad generalizability of findings.

P
hysical activity is known to reduce risks of heart dis-
ease and all-cause mortality,1 as well as risks of colon,
breast, and endometrial cancers.2 Less is known, how-
ever, about whether physical activity reduces risk of other can-
cers, which, together, constitute 75% of incident cancers in the
United States3 and 61% of cancers worldwide.4 Physical inac-
tivity is highly prevalent, with an estimated 51% of people in
the United States5 and 31% of people worldwide not attaining
recommended physical activity levels.6 Any decrease in risk
of cancer associated with physical activity may therefore be
relevant to public health and cancer prevention efforts.
To date, hundreds of prospective studies have examined
associations between physical activity and cancer risk,2 but,
owing to small case numbers, results have been inconclusive
for most cancer types. Meta-analyses, to a degree, mitigate the
sample size issue by pooling the published studies.2(pp198-209)
However, pooled studies have typically been heterogeneous
in study design (eg, case-control vs prospective cohort), physi-
cal activity types examined (eg, leisure-time vs occupational
activity), and in the contrasts examined (tertiles vs quintiles).
Such heterogeneity can attenuate risk estimates, thereby
masking true underlying associations.
In the present study, we examined leisure-time physical
activityinrelationtoriskof26differentcancertypesinapooled
analysis of 12 prospective cohort studies and 1.44 million par-
ticipants. We address several methodologic limitations in prior
research by attaining case numbers comparable to or exceed-
ing that of the current literature for most cancer types (see
eTable 1 in the Supplement), by restricting analyses to a spe-
cific study design (prospective cohort) and type of physical ac-
tivity (leisure time), and by examining the same consistent and
large contrast (90th vs 10th percentile) across studies. Our ob-
jectives were to determine the cancers associated with leisure-
time physical activity, and whether associations varied by ex-
cess bodyweight and smoking, among other factors of prior
interest. Our hypothesis was that higher levels of leisure-
time physical activity would be associated with lower risk of
the 26 cancer types.
Methods
Study Population
The Physical Activity Collaboration of the National Cancer In-
stitute’
s Cohort Consortium was formed to estimate physical
activityanddiseaseassociationsusingpooledprospectivedata
andastandardizedanalyticalapproach.Inapriorpooledanaly-
sis, we evaluated dose-response associations between leisure-
time physical activity and mortality.1
Prospective studies in the National Cancer Institute Co-
hortConsortiumwereeligibleforinclusioninthepresentstudy
if they assessed leisure-time physical activity and had appro-
priatecovariatedata.Forcohortswithkeydatamissingatbase-
linebutcollectedlater(5cohorts),baselinewasredefinedasthe
later date. Twenty of 23 cohorts (87%) met the inclusion crite-
ria and 12 (52%) agreed to participate, including 8 from the
United States and 4 from Europe (Table 1).7-18 Each study re-
ceived approval from its respective institutional review board.
Leisure-Time Physical Activity Assessment
Leisure-time physical activities are activities done at an indi-
vidual’
s discretion that improve or maintain fitness or health.
Our analysis includes leisure-time activities of moderate in-
tensity, defined as an intensity of 3 or more metabolic equiva-
lents (METs), or vigorous intensity, defined as 6 or more METs;
these are the intensity levels recommended by physical
activity guidelines.19(pvii)
Sevenofthe12cohorts9-11,14,15,18(29%oftheoverallsample)
assessed time per week in moderate and vigorous leisure-time
physicalactivities,enablingcalculationofMET-hoursperweek.
These cohorts assessed physical activity by asking about
discrete activities such as walking, running, or swimming,9,11
or, alternately, by inquiring about overall weekly participation
in moderate- to vigorous-intensity activities.10,14,15,18 The
median activity level was 8 MET-h/wk (interquartile range,
4-22 MET-h/wk) overall, and in 6 of 7 cohorts (eTable 2 in the
Supplement). This is equivalent to 150 minutes of moderate-
intensityactivity(eg,walking)perweek,andcomparabletothe
median activity level for the US population.5 Of the remaining
cohorts,4evaluatedonlyvigorous-intensityleisure-timephysi-
cal activity,8,13,16,17 and 1 evaluated frequency of moderate- to
vigorous-intensity activities, but not time spent.12 Ten of 12
cohorts used questionnaires previously validated against
objective criterion measures (eMethods in the Supplement).
Leisure-time physical activity levels were harmonized by
converting them to cohort-specific percentiles, with values
from 0 (low activity) to 100 (high activity). If physical activity
was based on categorical responses, the percentile at the
category midpoint was assigned. For example, if 20% of par-
ticipants indicated the lowest level of activity, they were
assigned the 10th percentile.
Cancer Ascertainment
Incident first primary cancers were identified by follow-up
questionnaires and review of medical records,7-9 cancer reg-
istry linkage,10-12,18 or both.13-17 Overall, 99% of cancer cases
were confirmed by medical records or pathology reports. Can-
certypewasdefinedusingtheSurveillance,Epidemiology,and
End Results site recode and the International Classification of
Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition20 (eTable 3 in the Supple-
ment).Participantswereobservedfrombaselinetodateofcan-
cer diagnosis, death, or end of follow-up, whichever came first.

Key Points
Question What is the association of leisure-time physical activity
with incidence of 26 types of cancer, and do the associations vary
by body size and/or smoking?
Findings In this study of pooled data from 12 US and European
cohorts, high vs low levels of leisure-time physical activity were
associated with lower risks of 13 of 26 cancers. Most of these
associations were evident regardless of body size or smoking
history.
Meaning Promotion of physical activity may be important for
population-wide cancer prevention and control efforts.

300 cases across studies. For each cancer, only cohorts with
at least 15 cases were included for analysis (eTable 4 in the
Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate HRs
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association
between leisure-time physical activity and cancer. The lin-
earity of physical activity and cancer associations was
evaluated with cubic splines and likelihood ratio tests.
Associations were predominantly linear (eFigure 1 in the
Supplement); therefore, physical activity was modeled on a
continuous linear basis for subsequent analyses. Hazard
ratios for higher vs lower physical activity levels are esti-
mated by comparing hazards at the 90th and 10th percen-
tiles of cohort-specific distributions, respectively. Hazard
ratios comparing higher vs lower activity levels were com-
puted as e90β-10β, where β is the log HR from the model for
the continuous physical activity percentile. DerSimonian
and Laird21 random-effects meta-analysis methods were
used to summarize cohort- and cancer site–specific results.
P < .05 was considered statistically significant. To account
for an increased type I error rate due to testing of multiple
outcomes, we also calculated the false-discovery rate22 for
primary findings. Statistical heterogeneity between studies
was evaluated by Cochran Q.23 Analyses were performed in
SAS, version 9.4.
Models included age, sex, smoking, alcohol, race/
ethnicity, education, and, for female-only cancers, hormone
therapy, oral contraceptive use, age at menarche, age at meno-
pause,andparity.Forovarianandendometrialcancers,women
who reported a history of oophorectomy and hysterectomy at
baseline, respectively, were excluded from analysis. Covari-
ates were selected on the basis of known associations with
cancer and are similar to those used in a study by Park et al24
of multiple cancer end points. Multiple-imputation
procedures25(pp104-117) were used to accommodate missing data
withineachcohort,withtheoverallproportionsofmissingdata
as follows: smoking status (2.3%), alcohol intake (1.3%), race/
ethnicity (1.7%), education (2.9%), hormone therapy (2.2%),
oral contraceptive use (0.8%), age at menarche (1.1%), age at
menopause (1.2%), and parity (1.9%). We also evaluated the
role of body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilo-
gramsdividedbyheightinmeterssquared)inphysicalactivity–
cancer associations by running all models with and without
adjustment for BMI.
We evaluated multiplicative effect modification by BMI
(<25, ≥25), smoking status (current, former, never smokers),
geographic region (United States, Europe), postmenopausal
hormone therapy (women only: ever-user, never-user), sex,
race (white, black), and follow-up (<5 years, ≥5 years) using
the Wald test for homogeneity. Interactions were declared if
P < .01.
Weconductedselectedcancersubgroupanalysesusingad-
ditional detailed data from the National Institutes of Health
(NIH)-AARP Diet and Health Study (eMethods in the Supple-
ment). Specifically, we examined associations for estrogen re-
ceptor (ER)-positive and -negative breast cancers and for non-
advanced and advanced prostate cancers. These specific
cancers and subtypes were selected on the basis of prior data
suggesting subtype specificity of associations.26,27 We also ex-

founder by adding covariates for intake of kilocalories, mul-
tivitamins, individual vitamin supplements, fruit, veg-
etables, and red meat. These diet covariates are the same as
in Park et al.24

Results
In our pooled data set, 1.44 million of 1.65 million partici-
pants had complete leisure-time physical activity data and no
history of cancer at baseline. Among participants, 57% were
women, the median age at baseline was 59 years (range, 19-98
years), and the median BMI was 26 (interquartile range, 23-
29) (Table 1). Higher activity levels were associated with
younger age, more education, lower BMI, and lower likeli-
hood of being a current smoker (eTable 5 in the Supplement).
During a median 11 years (interquartile range, 9-12 years) of
follow-up, 186 932 incident cancers were identified.
A higher level of leisure-time physical activity was asso-
ciated with lower risk for 13 of the 26 types of cancer (Figure 1,
eFigure 2 in the Supplement). Compared with a lower level of
leisure-time physical activity (10th percentile), higher level of
activity (at the 90th percentile) had strong inverse associa-
tions (greater than 20% reduction in risk) for 7 cancers: esoph-
ageal adenocarcinoma (HR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.37-0.89]), can-
cers of the liver (HR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.55-0.98]), lung (HR, 0.74
[95%CI,0.71-0.77]),kidney(HR,0.77[95%CI,0.70-0.85]),gas-
tric cardia (HR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.64-0.95]), and endometrium
(HR,0.79[95%CI,0.68-0.92]),andmyeloidleukemia(HR,0.80
[95% CI, 0.70-0.92]). Moderate inverse associations (10%-
20% reduction in risk) were observed for myeloma (HR, 0.83
[95% CI, 0.72-0.95]), colon cancer (HR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.77-
0.91]), head and neck cancer (HR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.78-0.93]),
rectal cancer (HR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.80-0.95]), bladder cancer
(HR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.82-0.92]), and breast cancer (HR, 0.90
[95% CI, 0.87-0.93]). Suggestive inverse associations were also
notedforgallbladdercancer(HR,0.72[95%CI,0.51-1.01]),small
intestine cancer (HR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.60-1.00]), and non-
Hodgkin lymphoma (HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.83-1.00]). Higher lev-
els of physical activity were associated with an increased risk
of prostate cancer (HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 1.03-1.08]) and malig-

nant melanoma (HR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.16-1.40]). Over the 26 can-
cers, the estimated false-discovery rate is 7%. This low false-
discovery rate suggests that chance is unlikely to explain any
more than 1 to 2 study findings. In aggregate, higher levels of
physical activity were associated with a 7% lower risk of total
cancer (HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.90-0.95]).
Heterogeneity between studies was modest, with nomi-
nal heterogeneity (P < .05) for esophageal adenocarcinoma,
liver cancer, soft-tissue cancer, colon cancer, melanoma, and
endometrial cancer. Exact causes of heterogeneity could not
be determined with certainty, but for esophageal adenocarci-
noma, liver cancer, and soft-tissue cancer, variability in HRs
may reflect small case numbers. For colon cancer, associa-
tions were weaker in female cohorts, and, for melanoma, as-
sociations were stronger in European studies (possibly reflect-
ingskintone).Forendometrialcancer,1outlyingresultappears
to drive heterogeneity, but the reason for the outlier is not un-
derstood. Despite quantitative heterogeneity, point esti-
mates for each study were generally consistent in direction.
In an influence analysis, excluding each study in turn only
modestly affected HRs (eTable 6 in the Supplement).
Adjusting for BMI attenuated associations for esophageal
adenocarcinoma and cancers of the liver, kidney, and gastric
cardia (ie, increase of 5%-11% in HRs) (see Table 2 and eFigure
3 in the Supplement) and nullified the association for endo-
metrial cancer; that is, the HR increased from 0.79 (statisti-
cally significant) to 0.98 (nonsignificant). Associations for liver
andgastriccardiawerenolongerstatisticallysignificantinBMI-
adjusted models, although HRs were still consistent with 15%
to 20% lower risk. Otherwise, the effects of adjustment for BMI
were modest, and 10 of 13 inverse associations remained
statistically significant after adjustment.
Effect modification by BMI was modest (Figure 2) except
for a slightly stronger lung cancer association (P for heteroge-
neity = .002) and a null endometrial cancer association (P for
heterogeneity < .001) in those with a BMI lower than 25. Ef-
fect modification by smoking history (Figure 3) was also mod-
est, except for a null lung cancer association in never smok-
ers (P for heterogeneity < .001) and an inverse myeloma
association in never smokers that became positive in current
smokers(Pforheterogeneity = .002).Therewasnoeffectmodi-

6%, and associations did not become uniformly stronger or
weaker (eTable 7 in the Supplement).
In additional analyses in the NIH-AARP study (eFigure 9
in the Supplement), leisure-time physical activity was
inversely associated with risk of ER-positive breast cancers
(HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.82-0.97]), and especially ER-negative
cancers (HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.59-0.88]; P for heteroge-
neity = .05). Leisure-time physical activity was associated
with higher risk of nonadvanced prostate cancer (HR, 1.08
[95% CI, 1.03-1.12]) but not advanced prostate cancer (HR,
0.99 [95% CI, 0.88-1.10]; P for heterogeneity = .14). The
leisure-time physical activity–melanoma association was
statistically significant in US regions with higher levels of
solar UV radiation (HR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.14-1.38]) but not in
regions with lower levels (HR, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.97-1.30]; P for
heterogeneity = .21). Lastly, adjustment for dietary factors
resulted in modest increases in HRs for esophageal adeno-
carcinoma (7%), liver cancer (5%), and rectal cancer (5%),
but for other physical activity–associated cancers,
the attenuation was minimal (<5%) (eTable 8 in the
Supplement).
Discussion
In this pooled analysis of 1.44 million participants, higher lev-
els of leisure-time physical activity (at the 90th percentile), as
compared with lower levels (at the 10th percentile), were as-
sociated with lower risk of 13 of 26 types of cancer examined,
with risk reductions of 20% or more for 7 of the cancers.
Leisure-time physical activity was also associated with higher
risk of malignant melanoma, and higher risk of nonadvanced
prostate cancer. A higher level of leisure-time physical activ-
ity was associated with a 7% lower risk of total cancer.
Our results suggest that leisure-time physical activity
may be associated with lower risk of a wider breadth of types

of cancer than previously described, and they bolster the
evidence for associations that were previously only weakly
supported. For example, associations for esophageal adeno-
carcinoma and gastric cardia cancer were among our stron-
gest findings, but previous prospective studies found small
effects compared with our own.28 For kidney and bladder
cancers, we observed clear inverse associations, while recent
meta-analyses reported nonsignificant associations in pro-
spective studies.29,30 For myeloid leukemia and myeloma,
we found robust inverse associations, whereas a 2015 meta-
analysis found null associations.31 For liver cancer, inverse
associations had been observed, but few studies had been
conducted32 and additional confirmatory data were needed.
We also observed nonsignificant inverse associations for
cancers of the gallbladder and small intestine, while existing
studies found no associations.32,33 Our findings confirm the
previously reported inverse associations between physical
activity and risk of colon, endometrial, and breast cancers,
and further extend the observation of inverse associations to
the ER-negative subtype of breast cancers (in the NIH-AARP
study).
Our study also systematically explored the role of BMI in
physical activity’
s association with the full spectrum of can-
cer types. Longitudinal studies34,35 and randomized exercise
trials36 show that physical activity helps prevent weight gain
and that exercise reduces levels of cancer-relevant biomark-
ers such as estradiol, mostly as a consequence of weight
loss.37,38 These combined observations have given rise to the
hypothesis that physical activity reduces cancer risk primar-
ily through lowering body weight. Our finding that physical
activity and cancer associations were generally BMI inde-
pendent argues against this hypothesis for most cancers.
However, for esophageal adenocarcinoma and cancers of the
liver, gastric cardia, kidney, and endometrium—cancers
known to be obesity related39—the associations were some-
what BMI dependent, and body mass index may potentially

be a mediating factor that explains why physical activity is
related to lower risk of these cancers. Unfortunately, we did
not have information about the trajectories of physical activ-
ity and body weight and therefore could not distinguish
between BMI’
s mediating and confounding roles.
We additionally observed that leisure-time physical
activity was strongly inversely associated with lung cancer
and unassociated with endometrial cancer in those with a
BMI lower than 25. For lung cancer, this may reflect higher
smoking prevalence among the lean, and thus higher poten-
tial for residual confounding. For endometrial cancer, this
may reflect the effect of removing body weight (because all
participants in this group are lean) from the causal path con-
necting physical activity to lower risk. For all other cancers,
there was little evidence for effect modification, suggesting
that among the overweight and obese, a higher physical
activity level is still associated with lower cancer risk. This is
important because not all persons who engage in high levels
of physical activity have low body weights. This finding may
help encourage those who are overweight or obese to be
physically active.
We separately examined risk associations among cur-
rent, former, and never smokers, and aside from lung cancer
and myeloma, found little evidence for effect modification.
For lung cancer, variability in the physical activity associa-
tion by smoking status could reflect an inability to com-
pletely adjust for smoking habits among current or former
smokers, that is, residual confounding. It is also conceivable,
however, that the different findings in current or former
smokers—who constitute almost all cases—are indicative of
distinct etiologic and biologic features of their lung cancers
compared with never smokers.40 Effect modification by
smoking status was not observed for other smoking-related
cancers such as head and neck cancer. This provides some
evidence against a generic bias due to residual confounding
by smoking, although case numbers were too small to rule
this out definitively. For myeloma, smoking is not a risk fac-
tor and effect modification may therefore be due to small
case numbers and/or chance.
Leisure-time physical activity was positively associated
with prostate cancer risk, but there is no known biologic ra-
tionale to explain this association. Physically active men are
more likely than inactive men to receive digital rectal exami-
nations and/or prostate-specific antigen screening,26 which
increases the likelihood of diagnosing indolent prostate can-
cers. The positive association that we observed could there-
fore be due to screening bias. To circumvent this potential bias,
weanalyzedadvancedprostatecancersintheNIH-AARPstudy
because advanced cases are less likely to remain indolent, and
found no association between physical activity and ad-
vanced prostate cancer. This difference in associations for
overall prostate cancers and advanced prostate cancers im-
plies that results for overall prostate cancers were influenced
by screening bias, although we cannot fully rule out etiologic
heterogeneity.
The higher risk of melanoma with increased leisure-time
physical activity was notable, particularly because this asso-
ciation has only been examined in 1 prior study. This case-
control study found that higher activity levels were associ-
ated with a 30% lower melanoma risk,41 a finding that our
analysisrefutes.Ofthe12cohortsweexamined,8foundhigher
activity levels to be associated with at least a 20% higher mela-
noma risk. Greater incidental sun exposure seems to be the
likely reason for this increase in melanoma risk because physi-
cal activity is frequently done outdoors in light clothing and
has been associated with substantially increased risk of
sunburn.42 Moreover, we found that the physical activity–
melanoma association was stronger in high-UV areas, imply-
ing that sun exposure is an important factor underlying this
association. Physically active people thus appear to be a
vulnerable population for melanoma, and cancer prevention
efforts focused on physical activity should emphasize sun
exposure safety (eg, http://www.cancer.org/healthy
/besafeinthesun/).
Physical activity’
s biological link with cancer has been hy-
pothesized to be mediated through 3 hormonal systems: sex
steroids, insulin and insulin-like growth factors, and
adipokines.43 Among other evidence for a link between physi-
cal activity and these hormonal systems, randomized exer-
cise trials show that randomization to a 1-year physical activ-
ityinterventionreduceslevelsofestroneandestradiol,37,38and
insulin44 in postmenopausal women, with effects mediated,
at least in part, through reduced adiposity. Several nonhor-
monal mechanisms have been hypothesized to link physical
activity to cancer risk, including inflammation, immune func-
tion, oxidative stress, and for colon cancer, reduced gastroin-
testinal transit time.43 Some of these nonhormonal mecha-
nismscouldpotentiallyexplainwhyphysicalactivitywasmore
robustly inversely associated with ER-negative than ER-
positive breast cancer. For some physical activity–associated
cancers in our study, for example, esophageal adenocarci-
noma or bladder cancer, less is known about the potential
mechanisms underlying the physical activity association and
our results suggest that further mechanistic research is
warranted.
The primary strength of our study is that, to our knowl-
edge, it is the largest ever conducted on physical activity and
cancer risk. This afforded us the statistical precision to exam-
ine uncommon and rare cancers that together constitute most
incident cancers. Another strength is our consistent method-
ological approach, including restriction to prospective co-
hort studies, and leisure-time physical activity, as well as ana-
lyzing the same large contrast in physical activity level across
studies.Thisapproachminimizesheterogeneity,improvescon-
sistency of results, and maximizes power. Finally, our results
are not susceptible to publication bias because our analysis is
not restricted to published data.
The main limitation of our study is that, in the context of
an observational study of lifestyle factors, we cannot fully ex-
clude the possibility that residual confounding by diet, smok-
ing, or other factors may affect our results. However, we did
control for many of the known cancer risk factors, and ad-
justed for diet in sensitivity analyses, with little overall effect
on results. We also carefully evaluated effects of adjusting for
BMI, and evaluated potential residual confounding by smok-
ing by estimating associations separately in never smokers. We

Anadditionallimitationisthatweusedself-reportedphysi-
cal activity, which entails some error in recall. Mitigating this
concern is the fact that many physical activity assessments
were previously validated and that the discrete, structured na-
ture of leisure-time physical activities makes them compara-
tively easy to recall.45 A further concern is that assessments
of physical activity differed somewhat by study; however, for
mostcancers,resultswerestillhighlyconsistentbetweenstud-
ies. Finally, not all cohorts assessed moderate- and vigorous-
intensity activities separately, and several cohorts lacked key
details needed to calculate MET-hours per week of physical ac-
tivity, a measure that would have enabled benchmarking our
findings against national guidelines. Our collaborative group
will conduct future studies targeting in greater detail the type,
intensity, and amount of physical activity needed to reduce
overall cancer risk in subsets with the relevant data.
Conclusions
Increasing levels of leisure-time physical activity were asso-
ciated with lower risks of 13 of the 26 cancers we investi-
gated, extending our current evidence base beyond colon,
breast,andendometrialcancers.Furthermore,ourresultssup-
port that these associations are broadly generalizable to dif-
ferent populations, including overweight or obese individu-
als, or those with a history of smoking. These findings support
promoting physical activity as a key component of population-
wide cancer prevention and control efforts.
