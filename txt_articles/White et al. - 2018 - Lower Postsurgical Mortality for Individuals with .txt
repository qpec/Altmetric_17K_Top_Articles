 Lower Postsurgical Mortality for Individuals with Dementia with Better-
Educated Hospital Workforce
Abstract
Surgical patients age 65 and over with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) were more likely to
die within 30 days of admission and to die after a complication than those without ADRD. Having better-
educated nurses in the hospital improved the likelihood of good outcomes for all surgical patients, but had a
much greater effect in individuals with ADRD. Specifically, a 10% increase in the proportion of nurses with a
Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree or higher was associated with 10% lower odds of death and 10%
lower odds of dying after a complication for surgical patients with ADRD.

 THE QUESTION
Individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) 
are at high risk for adverse outcomes during hospitalization, especially 
after surgery, because they have high delirium risk, more comorbidities, 
mobility limitations, and impaired communication. Nurses serve as 
the primary clinical surveillance system in hospitals, and can identify 
complications and intervene early. This is important in individuals with 
ADRD, who often cannot recognize a problem or clearly signal for help 
when needed. More than a decade of research has demonstrated that 
individuals cared for in hospitals with more nurses holding a Bachelor 
of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree or higher have better outcomes, 
including lower mortality, lower rates of failure to rescue (death after a 
complication), fewer readmissions, and shorter stays. 
Could being treated by higher-educated nurses mitigate some of the 
heightened risk faced by surgical patients with ADRD? Using 2006-7 
Medicare claims data linked with nurse survey data in four states, the 
authors examined the separate and combined effects of ADRD and 
BSN-educated nurses on mortality and failure to rescue among surgical 
patients age 65 and over. 
THE FINDINGS
The study included 353,333 Medicare beneficiaries who underwent general, 
orthopedic, or vascular surgery in one of 531 hospitals, in which the proportion 
of nurses holding a BSN degree or higher varied (0–73.9%, mean 38.5%, 
median 38.0%). Hospitals with higher proportions of BSN nurses tended to be 
larger, major teaching hospitals and high-technology facilities. Individuals with 
ADRD undergoing surgery were on average older, had more comorbidities, 
experienced more postoperative complications, and had longer lengths of 
stay than those without ADRD.
Direct ADRD and BSN nursing effects. Controlling for hospital, 
procedure, and individual characteristics, individuals with ADRD undergoing 
surgery were 88% more likely to die within 30 days of admission and 53% 
more likely to experience failure to rescue than those without ADRD. For all 
individuals undergoing surgery, each 10% increase in the proportion of nurses 
holding a BSN degree or higher was associated with 6% lower odds of death 
and 6% lower odds of failure to rescue.
Combined ADRD-BSN nursing effects. Controlling for hospital, 
procedure, and individual characteristics, each 10% increase in the proportion 
of BSN nurses was associated with 4% lower odds of death and 5% lower 
odds of failure to rescue for patients without ADRD, but 10% lower odds of 
death, and 10% lower odds of failure to rescue for patients with ADRD. The 
Figure depicts the differences in predicted probabilities of these outcomes 
for individuals with and without ADRD at hospitals with varying proportions 
of BSN nurses.

 BRIEF
Research
LDI
If these relationships were indeed causal, these findings suggest that 
increasing the proportion of BSN nurses in a hospital from 20% to 80% would 
lead to seven fewer deaths and 17 fewer cases of failure to rescue per 1,000 
individuals without ADRD, and 35 fewer deaths and 51 fewer cases of failure 
to rescue per 1,000 individuals with ADRD.
THE IMPLICATIONS
As the population ages, hospitals will face the challenges of caring for 
a rising number of clinically complex patients with ADRD. In this study, 
individuals with ADRD were older, had more comorbidities and longer 
stays, and experienced more complications than those without ADRD. 
This complexity requires care from nurses who are trained to think 
critically, synthesize and analyze large amounts of information, problem 
solve, and coordinate care across disciplines, competencies that are 
emphasized in BSN degree programs.
The findings highlight the role of the nurse in not only preventing 
complications in this vulnerable population, but mitigating the effects 
of complications once they occur. For example, in this study nearly 18% 
of patients with ADRD experienced psychosis (often due to delirium), 
compared to just 1% of those without ADRD. T
argeted nursing 
interventions including risk assessment, environmental modifications, 
early mobilization, reorientation, and nutritional support, can help to 
reduce the incidence and consequences of delirium. Similarly, close 
surveillance and nursing interventions can prevent or reduce the effect of 
other complications patients with ADRD are likely to experience, such as 
pneumonia, pressure ulcers, and falls.
In 2010, the Institute of Medicine released its landmark Future of Nursing 
report, which recommended increasing the percentage of nurses with 
BSN degrees in the workforce to 80% by 2020. This study supports 
this recommendation by demonstrating a vulnerable group of patients’ 
sensitivity to variation in BSN education and adds to the evidence on the 
value of transitioning to a largely BSN-educated workforce.
THE STUDY
This was a cross-sectional analysis of linked datasets representing 
California, Florida, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania hospitals. The authors 
used 2006-2007 Medicare data on inpatient hospitalizations and 
beneficiary demographics, and the 2006 Multi-State Nursing Care and 
Patient Safety Survey of registered nurses.
The study population included 353,333 Medicare beneficiaries who 
underwent general, orthopedic, or vascular surgery in one of 531 hospitals 
in California, Florida, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Hospitals were 
included if outcomes data were available for at least 50 patients and if 
there were at least 10 direct care nurses from the hospital represented in 
the nurse survey.
The authors estimated the direct effects of ADRD and BSN education, 
separately, on mortality and failure to rescue, and then the interaction 
effects of ADRD and BSN education on the outcomes in models fully 
adjusted for individual, procedure, and hospital characteristics.
