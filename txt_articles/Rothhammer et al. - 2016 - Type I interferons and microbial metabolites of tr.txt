 sclerosis (MS) patients. IFN-I signaling in astrocytes reduces inflammation and experimental 
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) disease scores via the ligand-activated transcription factor 
aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2). The anti-
inflammatory effects of nasally administered IFN-β are partly mediated by AhR. Dietary 
tryptophan is metabolized by the gut microbiota into AhR agonists that act on astrocytes to limit 
CNS inflammation. EAE scores were increased following ampicillin treatment during the recovery 
phase, and CNS inflammation was reduced in antibiotic-treated mice by supplementation with the 
tryptophan metabolites indole, indoxyl-3-sulfate (I3S), indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) and indole-3-
aldehyde (IAld), or the bacterial enzyme tryptophanase. In individuals with MS, the circulating 
levels of AhR agonists were decreased. These findings suggest that IFN-I produced in the CNS act 
in combination with metabolites derived from dietary tryptophan by the gut flora to activate AhR 
signaling in astrocytes and suppress CNS inflammation.
Astrocytes are the most abundant cell population in the central nervous system (CNS). They 
participate in diverse functions including control of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the 
regulation of metabolism, the modulation of neuronal transmission and CNS development 
and repair1–9. Astrocytes also play important roles during CNS injury and disease, and are 
thought to participate in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model 
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)10–12. Astrocyte activity is affected by 
factors produced within and outside the CNS, therefore, the study of these factors may shed 
light on the regulation of astrocyte function in health and disease and identify new 
therapeutic approaches for human neurologic disorders.
The microbial flora and its products have been shown to control T cell-dependent 
inflammation through several mechanisms including the conversion of precursors provided 
by the diet into immune regulatory metabolites13–15. However, less is known about the 
effects of the diet and microbial products on the inflammatory response of resident cells in 
the CNS. Here we identify an IFN-I and AhR axis that integrates immunologic, metabolic 
and environmental cues to regulate astrocyte activity and CNS inflammation.
 Results
 Astrocytes show a transcriptional response to IFN-I during EAE
To study the regulation of astrocyte function during autoimmune CNS inflammation, we 
induced EAE in C57Bl/6 mice by immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 
35–55 (MOG35-55) in Complete Freund’s Adjuvant (CFA) and analyzed mRNA expression 
in astrocytes by RNA-sequencing (Supplementary Figs. 1a,b). We detected 17,964 expressed 
genes (Fig. 1a), and found 1,879 transcripts that were differentially regulated in astrocytes 
during EAE compared to astrocytes from naive mice (Fig. 1b). Although these transcripts 
were associated with different functional families, ingenuity pathway analysis and functional 
gene clustering revealed that most genes were linked to IFN-I signaling (Supplementary 
Table 1). Upregulation of genes associated with IFN-I signaling genes during EAE was 
validated in an independent set of astrocyte samples by qPCR (Fig. 1c).

 We also validated the upregulation of genes previously associated with EAE, including Ccl2, 
Nos2 and Csf24,8,11 (Supplementary Fig. 1c). When adjusted for the number of cells, 
astrocytes were a dominant source of Ccl2, Nos2 and Csf2 expression in the inflamed CNS 
(Supplementary Figs. 1d,e). The expression of these genes in astrocytes was more strongly 
induced by immunization with MOG35-55 in CFA than with CFA alone, suggesting that it is 
mostly triggered by immune cell infiltration into the CNS (Supplementary Fig. 2).
 IFN-I signaling in astrocytes limits CNS inflammation
IFN-I are important regulators of inflammation in the context of infections, autoimmunity 
and other physiological processes16–18. To investigate the role of IFN-I signaling in 
astrocytes during EAE we knocked-down the interferon alpha/beta receptor 1 (Ifnar1) using 
a lentivirus-delivered shRNA (shIfnar1) expressed under the control of the GFAP promoter, 
which in this vector also controls the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)11,19 
(Fig. 2a). The lentivirus was administered intracerebroventricularily into the CNS 7 and 15 
days after EAE induction; a lentivirus carrying a non-targeting shRNA was used as a control 
(shControl). IFNAR1 silencing worsened EAE, as indicated by higher disease scores and 
failure to recover (Fig. 2a).
As assessed by qPCR, Ifnar1 expression was efficiently knocked down in GFP+ astrocytes 
sorted from shIfnar1-treated mice, but not in microglia (Fig. 2b). Transcripts associated with 
the response to IFN-I such as Mx1 and other genes of the IFN-I signaling pathway (Stat1, 
Stat2, Irf9) were down-regulated in shIfnar1-treated astrocytes but not in microglia (Fig. 2b). 
In agreement with the worsening of EAE, using custom-made NanoString nCounter arrays 
(Supplementary Table 2) we detected upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes (Ifng, Il6, 
Nos2, Ccl2 and Il23a) in astrocytes from shIfnar1-treated mice (Fig. 2c). Moreover, Ifnar1 
knock-down reduced the expression of the immunomodulatory transcription factor aryl 
hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) and its target gene Cyp1b1 in astrocytes (Figs. 2c,d). Although 
IFNAR1 knock-down was restricted to astrocytes, it was also associated with the increased 
expression of pro-inflammatory transcripts in microglia and Ly-6Chi monocytes (Figs. 2e,f 
and Supplementary Table 3) suggesting that IFN-I signaling modulates functional 
interactions between astrocytes and myeloid cells. Taken together, these data show that IFN-
I signaling in astrocytes limits CNS inflammation and induces AhR expression.
 IFN-I induces AhR expression in astrocytes
AhR regulates inflammation through its effects on several components of the immune 
system20,21. We first investigated whether AhR expression is controlled by IFN-I signaling 
in astrocytes. Similar to what has been previously reported for interferon-β IFN-β22, 
expression of Ahr and its target gene Cyp1b1 was increased in astrocytes during EAE (Fig. 
3a). In agreement with our in vivo findings, treatment with IFN-β up-regulated Ahr 
expression in primary mouse astrocytes in culture in an IFNAR1-dependent manner (Fig. 
3b).
Astrocytes produce IL-2723 and IL-27 is thought to contribute to the therapeutic effects of 
IFN-β in MS24. Although IL-27 up-regulates AhR expression in DCs and CD4+ Tr1 
regulatory cells25–27, IFN-β treatment also up-regulated AhR expression in IL-27 receptor

 deficient astrocytes, indicating that IFN-β induces AhR expression independently of IL-27 
(Supplementary Fig. 3a).
We then analyzed the direct regulation of AhR expression by IFN-β. IFNAR1 activation 
triggers JAK1/TYK2-dependent phosphorylation of STAT1, which dimerizes with 
phosphorylated STAT217. The STAT1/STAT2 heterodimer assembles with IRF9 to form a 
trimolecular complex called IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), which translocates to the 
nucleus and binds specific IFN-response elements (ISREs) to control the expression of 
interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (Fig. 3c). In line with these findings, exposure of primary 
cultures of astrocytes to IFN-β resulted in the phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT2, 
which peaked after 15 minutes (Fig. 3d). Inhibition of ISGF3 assembly by trichostatin A or 
impairment of ISGF3 translocation to the nucleus by sodium fluoride (NaF) inhibited the up-
regulation of both the ISGF3 target genes Mx1 and Ahr (Fig. 3e).
A bioinformatic analysis of the AhR promoter identified an ISRE that could be targeted by 
STAT1/STAT2-containing ISGF3 complexes formed in response to IFNAR1 activation, and 
also 4 STAT1 binding sites that could be recognized following STAT1 activation by other 
stimuli such as IFN-γ (Fig. 3f). In vitro activation of astrocytes with IFN-β resulted in the 
recruitment of STAT1 and STAT2 to the ISRE in the Ahr promoter, but not to the STAT1 
binding sites, as determined in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays (Fig. 3g). 
These data suggest that STAT1 is recruited to the ISRE as part of an IFN-I dependent ISGF3 
complex containing STAT2. STAT1 and STAT2 were also recruited to the ISRE in the Ahr 
promoter in astrocytes during EAE in an IFNAR1-dependent manner (Fig. 3h). Considering 
up-regulation of Ahr expression in astrocytes dependent on IFNAR1 during EAE (Figs. 
2c,d), these data suggest that ISGF3 drives Ahr expression in astrocytes during CNS 
inflammation. Moreover, its increased recruitment to STAT1 binding sites following Ifnar1 
knock-down suggest that IFN-I limits the accessibility of STAT1 to those sites in vivo, 
probably through the formation of STAT1/STAT2 heterodimers and/or epigenetic 
mechanisms.
To further investigate the effects of IFN-β on AhR-dependent transcriptional regulation we 
performed reporter assays using a construct in which an AhR-responsive promoter controls 
luciferase expression28. Exposure of HEK293 cells to IFN-β transactivated the AhR-
responsive promoter (Fig. 3i). This transactivation was mediated by AhR, as evidenced by 
its inhibition by the AhR-specific antagonist CH-223191 (Fig. 3i). Collectively, these 
findings suggest that ISGF3 assembled in astrocytes in response to IFN-β induces AhR-
dependent transcriptional programs.
 AhR expression in astrocytes limits CNS inflammation
To study the role of AhR expressed in astrocytes on the regulation of CNS inflammation we 
deleted AhR in astrocytes by crossing AhRfl/fl mice with mice expressing the Cre 
recombinase under the control of the GFAP promoter29. EAE was induced in GFAP-
Crepos;AhRfl/fl (GFAP-AhR deficient) and GFAP-Creneg;AHRfl/fl (control) mice and disease 
course was monitored. EAE disease scores were worse in GFAP-AhR deficient mice, mostly 
characterized by failure to recover during the chronic phase of the disease (Fig. 4a and 
Supplementary Table 4).

 GFAP is also expressed outside the CNS, including cells of the enteric nervous system30. 
Thus, it is possible that GFAP-driven AhR deletion in these cells and not astrocytes is 
responsible for the worsening of EAE in GFAP-AhR mice. To investigate the role of AhR in 
GFAP+ astrocytes during EAE, we constructed a lentivirus in which an AhR-targeting 
shRNA was expressed under the control of the GFAP promoter (shAhR-LV) and used it to 
knock down Ahr expression in GFAP+ astrocytes. The administration of shAhR-LV resulted 
in a significant worsening of EAE (Supplementary Figs. 3b,c), suggesting that disease 
worsening in GFAP-AhR mice results from AhR deficiency in GFAP+ astrocytes and not in 
GFAP+ cells outside the CNS.
AhR deficiency in astrocytes did not affect recall T cell responses in terms of proliferation or 
cytokine production in the periphery nor the recruitment of effector and regulatory T cells to 
the CNS (Supplementary Figs. 3d–f). However, expression of chemokines (for instance, 
Ccl2, Ccl20 and Cxcl10), cytokines (e.g. Il6, Il12, Il23) and pro-inflammatory markers such 
as Vim, Nos2, and Csf2 was increased in AhR-deficient astrocytes during EAE (Fig. 4a, 
lower panel). In agreement with the increased production of chemokines, AhR deletion in 
astrocytes was associated with an increase in the number of CD11b+CD45+Ly-6Chi CNS-
infiltrating monocytes (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 3f). In addition, expression of 
markers associated with inflammation and neurodegeneration were increased in microglia 
and monocytes from GFAP-AhR mice (Supplementary Table 3 and Fig. 4c).
To investigate the role of AhR in astrocytes we studied WT and AhR-deficient primary 
mouse astrocytes in culture. Expression of Ccl2, Csf2 and Nos2 was increased upon 
activation of AhR-deficient astrocytes with LPS (Fig. 4c). Astrocyte-produced factors have 
been linked to the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes to the CNS31. Supernatants from 
stimulated astrocytes promoted migration of CD11b+Ly-6chi monocytes in transwell assays, 
and this migration-promoting activity was increased in supernatants from AhR-deficient 
astrocytes (Fig. 4d). Blocking antibodies to CCL-2, GM-CSF and/or M-CSF interfered with 
the migration of monocytes induced by astrocyte supernatants, suggesting that the increased 
expression of these molecules in AhR-deficient astrocytes is responsible for their increased 
chemotactic activity (Fig. 4d).
Astrocyte-produced factors modulate the polarization of microglia and monocytes, and may 
also have direct neurotoxic effects8,11. Co-culture of activated AhR-deficient astrocytes with 
monocytes increased expression of pro-inflammatory markers (Il6, Il12, Il23a, Nos2, Ccl2) 
and decreased the expression of IL-10 in re-isolated monocytes (Fig. 4e). Moreover, culture 
supernatants from AhR-deficient astrocytes were more neurotoxic in vitro as compared to 
supernatants from WT astrocytes (Fig. 4e). Taken together, these data show that AhR 
signaling in astrocytes controls transcriptional programs that regulate the recruitment of 
Ly-6Chi inflammatory monocytes to the CNS, the activation of microglia and monocytes and 
astrocytic neurotoxic activities during EAE.
 SOCS2 induced by AhR in astrocytes limits NF-κB activation
The transcription factor NF-κB regulates the response of astrocytes to activation and their 
potential pathogenic activities during CNS inflammation32,33. To study the mechanisms used 
by AhR to regulate astrocyte function, we analyzed by ChIP the recruitment of NF-κB to the

 Ccl2, Csf2 and Nos2 promoters, because these genes have been linked to the recruitment of 
inflammatory monocytes to the CNS, the induction of neurotoxic activities in monocytes and 
microglia, and direct neurotoxic activities in astrocytes4,8,11. Following in vitro activation, 
binding of NF-κB to the Ccl2, Csf2 and Nos2 promoters was increased in AhR-deficient 
astrocytes, suggesting that AhR limits NF-κB activation in astrocytes (Fig. 4f).
AhR is reported to induce the expression of SOCS2 in B cells34, which interferes with NF-
κB activation35. Activation of astrocytes in vitro with LPS or IFN-β induces recruitment of 
AhR to target sites in the promoter of Socs2, and the AhR-dependent upregulation of Socs2 
expression (Figs. 4g,h). Activation of AhR- or SOCS2-deficient astrocytes with LPS in vitro 
resulted in increased NF-κB activation, supporting a role for SOCS2 in the suppression of 
astrocyte activation by AhR (Fig. 4i). Expression of Ccl2, Csf2 and Nos2 was increased in in 
vitro activated SOCS2-deficient astrocytes (Fig. 4j). Thus, these data suggest that AhR 
controls the pathogenic activities of astrocytes during EAE by limiting NF-κB activation in a 
SOCS2-dependent manner.
 Astrocytic AhR mediates the suppressive effects of IFN-β
IFN-β is a first line therapy for MS and suppresses EAE36,37. Previous studies in mice have 
focused mainly on the effects of peripherally administered IFN-β on T cells and monocytes, 
because IFN-β does not cross the blood brain barrier37. To investigate the role of AhR on the 
effects of IFN-β on astrocytes during EAE we administered IFN-β intranasally (i.n.) because 
this route of administration results in accumulation of IFN-β in the CNS38. In support of a 
CNS-restricted biodistribution of i.n. administered IFN-β, we detected the up-regulation of 
Mx1 expression in astrocytes, but not in splenic cells from WT mice (Fig. 5a). I.n. 
administration of IFN-β started 7 days after disease induction reduced EAE scores in WT 
but not in GFAP-AhR deficient mice (Fig. 5b). Conversely, the specific deletion of AhR in 
microglia in CX3CR1-CreERT2;AhRfl/fl mice, one month after treatment with tamoxifen39, 
did not alter the effects of i.n. IFN-β (Supplementary Figs. 4a,b). Expression of pro-
inflammatory cytokines and activation markers in astrocytes were decreased in WT mice 
treated with i.n. IFN-β. This was not observed in astrocytes from GFAP-AhR-deficient mice 
(Fig. 5c left). Of note, the expression of the IFN-I responsive gene Mx1 was not altered in 
GFAP-AhR as compared to control mice, indicating the co-existence of AhR-dependent and 
-independent IFN-I regulated genes. Il10 expression was up-regulated in AhR-deficient 
astrocytes (Fig. 5c left), suggesting that AhR does not drive Il10 expression in astrocytes as 
reported for T cells25,27,40,41. The number of CNS-infiltrating monocytes (Fig. 5c middle) 
and expression of pro-inflammatory molecules (Fig. 5c right) was decreased in WT but not 
GFAP- AhR deficient mice after i.n. IFN-β treatment. Hence, IFN-β signaling in astrocytes 
limits CNS inflammation in an AhR dependent manner.
 Dietary tryptophan limits CNS inflammation via AhR
The activity of AhR is regulated by small molecules, some of which are provided by the diet 
and the commensal flora20. The AhR-dependent anti-inflammatory effects of IFN-β suggest 
that dietary and microbial AhR ligands might regulate IFN-I signaling in astrocytes and 
CNS inflammation. Tryptophan (Trp) is an essential amino acid provided by the diet that is 
metabolized to into several AhR ligands20. To study the AhR-dependent effects of the diet

 on the regulation of CNS inflammation by astrocytes we induced EAE in WT and GFAP 
AhR-deficient mice and, starting on day 22 we fed the mice a Trp-depleted diet (TDD) or 
TDD supplemented with Trp (TDD+Trp) as described42. Lack of dietary Trp worsened EAE 
scores (Supplementary Fig. 5a), without affecting the levels of Trp or its catabolites 
serotonin and kynurenic acid (Supplementary Fig. 5b). The worsening of EAE scores could 
be reverted by Trp supplementation in control but not GFAP-AhR-deficient mice (Fig. 5d), 
suggesting that Trp-derived ligands of AhR act through astrocytes. Dietary Trp deficiency 
was associated with increased Ccl2 and Nos2 expression in astrocytes, which could not be 
reverted by Trp supplementation in GFAP-AhR deficient mice (Fig. 5e).
Trp-derived AhR agonists are generated through complex biochemical pathways catalyzed 
by commensal and host enzymes42–44. Indeed, Ampicillin (Amp)-sensitive Vancomycin 
(Vanco)-resistant bacteria generate AhR agonists from dietary Trp44. Thus, we tested the 
effects of antibiotic oral administration on late stage EAE and found that Amp, but not 
Vanco, interfered with disease recovery (Fig. 5f).
Bacterial tryptophanase (TnAse) catalyzes the conversion of dietary Trp to indole, which is 
used in the liver as a precursor for the synthesis of the AhR agonist indoxyl-3-sulfate 
(I3S)43,45. I3S is undetectable in germ free mice, indicating that its generation is dependent 
on the commensal flora43. Indeed, Amp administration decreased I3S urinary levels (Fig. 5h 
right). Moreover, peripherally administered I3S crosses the BBB and activates AhR in 
astrocytes (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Collectively, these data suggest that I3S produced by 
Amp-sensitive commensal bacteria participates in the regulation of astrocyte activity by 
AhR.
I3S or indole supplementation reduced EAE disease scores in Amp-treated mice (Fig. 5g) 
and increased I3S to levels (Fig. 5h right) to a similar extent to those detected in non-Amp 
treated mice. Moreover, I3S or indole supplementation reduced Ccl2 and Nos2 expression in 
astrocytes in an AhR-dependent manner (Fig. 5h and Supplementary Figs. 5e,f). Similar 
results were obtained when recombinant TnAse was administered by gavage to Amp-treated 
mice (Figs. 5g and Supplementary Figs. 5e,f).
TnAse-independent enzymatic reactions in commensal bacteria can also result in the 
synthesis of AhR agonists different from I3S such as indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) and 
indole-3-aldehyde (IAld) 44. Supplementation with IPA or IAld also reduced EAE scores in 
Amp-treated mice while reducing Ccl2 and Nos2 expression in astrocytes (Fig. 5h,i). IPA or 
IAld administration, however, did not restore peripheral I3S concentrations (Fig. 5h right).
Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) has been described to participate in the transformation of 
dietary Trp into AhR agonists 44. Interestingly, treatment with Amp but not with Vanco was 
associated with a reduction in L. reuteri 16S-RNA levels in the feces of treated mice (Fig. 
5j). Taken together, these data suggest that L. reuteri and other Amp-sensitive Vanco-
resistant commensal bacteria catalyze via TnAse dependent and independent pathways the 
conversion of dietary Trp into AhR agonists that modulate astrocyte function during EAE.

  IFN-I/AhR signaling modulates human astrocyte activation
To examine the clinical relevance of our findings we analyzed the expression of genes 
involved in IFN-I signaling in brain samples taken from MS lesions and normal appearing 
white matter (NAWM) from individuals with MS, as well as controls. Expression of MX1 
and the IFN-I pathway genes STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9 was upregulated in brain samples 
from individuals with MS (Fig. 6a). AHR expression was also upregulated in MS lesions 
(Fig. 6b).
In MS brain samples pSTAT1, MX1 and AhR co-localized with GFAP+ astrocytes in active 
and chronic MS lesions, as assessed by immunofluorescence (Supplementary Fig. 6), 
suggesting that IFN-I signaling promotes AhR expression in human astrocytes. Incubation of 
human fetal astrocytes in vitro with IFN-β up-regulated the expression of AHR (Fig. 6c). 
Activation of AhR by I3S decreased the expression of the pro-inflammatory genes NOS2, 
TNFa, IL6 and CCL2 in human astrocytes (Fig. 6d). In co-staining studies, however we 
detected the co-expression of AHR with CCL2 and iNos in GFAP+ cells (Fig. 6e and 
Supplementary Fig. 7), suggesting that although AhR expression is induced by IFN-I 
signaling during MS, the AhR-dependent regulation of astrocyte function may be impaired 
in MS.
Expression of the AhR transcriptional target CYP1B1 is decreased in MS lesions and 
NAWM (Fig. 6f). Using an AhR-responsive reporter to quantify AhR agonistic activity in 
MS and healthy control sera, decreased AhR agonistic activity was detected in sera from 
individuals with MS as compared to controls (Fig. 6g). Moreover, using a metabolomic 
approach we detected decreased levels of Trp-derived AhR-activating molecules and related 
metabolites in MS samples (Fig. 6h). Taken together, these data support a role for the IFN-
β/AhR axis in the regulation of human astrocytes, and suggest that deficits in AhR agonists 
provided by the metabolism, the diet, the commensal flora or the environment may 
contribute to the pathogenesis of MS.
 Discussion
In this work we describe a novel IFN-I/AhR axis that limits pathogenic astrocyte functions 
in MS and potentially, other neurologic disorders. Beneficial and deleterious effects have 
been assigned to IFN-β in CNS inflammation. Peripheral IFN-β administration is first line 
disease modifying therapy for MS, thought to act through its effects on dendritic cells (DCs), 
B and T cells24,37. IFN-β, however, boosts the production of pathogenic antibodies and 
exacerbates immunopathology in neuromyelitis optica46. These opposing effects of IFN-β on 
CNS inflammation in MS and neuromyelitis optica highlight the need to study its cell-
specific effects on CNS immunopathology.
Peripherally administered IFN-β does not cross the BBB, but substantial amounts of IFN-β 
are produced by astrocytes, microglia and CNS-infiltrating plasmacytoid DCs during EAE47. 
Microglia, infiltrating monocytes and neurons are cell populations directly targeted by IFN-β 
to arrest CNS inflammation and neurodegeneration22,48,49. We found significant anti-
inflammatory and neurodegeneration-arresting effects of IFNAR1 signaling in astrocytes 
mediated by AhR-driven transcriptional programs. Thus, our data support targeting IFNAR1

 signaling within the CNS for the therapeutic control of inflammation and astrocyte-driven 
neurodegeneration. The translational value of IFNAR1 activation in astrocytes, however, 
should be evaluated in the context of the deleterious effects of excessive IFN-I signaling in 
the CNS50.
The study of AhR signaling in EAE has been focused on its role in the regulation of effector 
and regulatory T cells, either directly or through the modulation of DC function27,40,41,51–53. 
AhR agonists with physiologically relevant important immunomodulatory activities are 
provided by environmental sources and also by cellular metabolism54,55. Together with 
recent reports of decreased levels of AhR agonists in inflammatory bowel disease56, our data 
suggest that imbalances in the uptake, production and/or degradation of AhR agonists may 
contribute to the pathogenesis of MS and other immune-mediated diseases, establishing a 
new link between the environment, metabolism and inflammation.
Environmental factors are known to contribute to the development of MS, but limited 
information is available about the identity of most of those factors and their mechanisms of 
action. Besides cellular metabolism, the diet and the commensal flora are abundant 
physiological sources of AhR agonists20. Depending on the experimental model, pro- and 
anti-inflammatory effects of the commensal flora have been recently reported57,58,14,15,59 
highlighting the need to identify the molecular mechanisms by which the commensal flora 
regulates the immune response. In this context, our work contributes to the understanding of 
the anti-inflammatory effects of AhR agonists generated from dietary Trp by TnAse 
dependent and independent pathways in commensal bacteria44. Moreover, our results 
identify a molecular pathway through which the diet in cooperation with the commensal 
flora modulate the activity of CNS resident cells and neuroinflammation. In addition, the 
regulation of AhR expression by IFN-β suggest that the microbiome may affect not only the 
development of CNS autoimmunity, but also its response to disease modifying therapies60. 
Thus, the study of the metabolic and environmental factors that regulate astrocyte activity 
may shed light on CNS physiology, identify mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and drive 
the development of more efficacious therapeutic interventions for MS and other neurologic 
diseases.

C57BL/6J, Ifnar1−/−, IL-27ra−/−, GFAP-Cre, and AhRfl/fl mice were obtained from the 
Jackson Laboratory and were all female. Mice with a specific deletion of AhR in astrocytes 
were generated by crossing GFAP-Cre and AhRfl/fl mice, efficient deletion of AhR in 
astrocytes was verified by PCR and Western blotting (data not shown). CX3CR1-CreERT2 
mice39 were a kind gift from Steffen Jung (Weizmann Institute of science) and were bred to 
AhRfl/fl mice. For activation of Cre recombinase activity, 5 week old mice were injected 
subcutaneously with 4 mg tamoxifen (Sigma) in 200 μl warm corn oil at two time points 48 
hours apart. Four weeks later, the expression of AhR in microglia and macrophages was 
determined by qPCR and mice subjected to EAE induction. All mice were on the C57Bl/6 
background and were kept in a pathogen-free facility at the Harvard Institutes of Medicine.

 All experiments were carried out in accordance with guidelines prescribed by the 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Harvard Medical School.
 EAE induction and treatments
EAE was induced in eight to ten weeks old mice by subcutaneous immunization with 200 μg 
MOG35–55 peptide emulsified in complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA, Difco Laboratories) per 
mouse, followed by administration of 200 ng pertussis toxin (PTX, List biological 
laboratories, Inc.) on days 0 and 2 as described26. Clinical signs of EAE were assessed 
according to the following score: 0, no signs of disease; 1, loss of tone in the tail; 2, hind 
limb paresis; 3, hind limb paralysis; 4, tetraplegia; 5, moribund. Human Interferon-beta 1a 
(Rebif, Merck Serono) or vehicle control was administered daily at a dose of 5.000 IU 
intranasally or intraperitoneally as outlined in the specific experiments. Antibiotics, Trp-
indoles, and TnAse were administered daily by oral gavage starting from day 22 after EAE 
induction at the following doses: Ampicillin 6 mg/20 g body weight (BW), vancomycin 3 
mg/20 g BW; indole, indole-3-propionic acid, indole-3-aldehyde at 400 μg/20g BW, TnAse 
at 200 μg/20 g BW. I3S was administered daily intraperitoneally at a dose of 200 μg/20g 
BW. All agents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich.
 Isolation of cells from adult mouse CNS
Mononuclear cells were isolated from the CNS as previously described11. Astrocytes, 
monocytes, and microglia were sorted as described before11 and outlined in Supplementary 
Fig. 1. Isolated CNS cells were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibody to CD11b 
(M1/70, 1:50), CD45 (90, 1:50), Ly6C (HK1.4. 1:100), CD105 (N418, 1:100), CD140a 
(APA5, 1:100), CD11c (N418, 1:100), F4/80 (BM8, 1:50), O4 (O4, Miltenyi Biotec, 1:10), 
and CD19 (eBio1D3, 1:100). All antibodies were from eBioscience or BD Pharmingen 
unless otherwise mentioned. Microglia were sorted as CD11b+ cells with low CD45 
expression and low Ly6C (CD11b+CD45lowLy6Clow), inflammatory monocytes were 
considered as CD45hiCD11b+Ly6Chi61. Astrocytes were sorted as CD11blowCD45low 
Ly6ClowCD105lowCD140alowCD11blowF4/80lowO4lowCD19low after the exclusion of 
lymphocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, monocytes (Supplementary Fig. 1). Sorted cells 
were found to be >85% GFAP+ by FACS analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1). We confirmed 
that we had isolated a relatively pure population of astrocytes by qPCR analysis of the 
expression of the astrocyte markers gfap, aldh1l1 and aqp4.
 Flow cytometry staining and acquisition
Mononuclear cell suspensions were prepared as previously described11. Antibodies for flow 
cytometry were purchased from eBioscience or BD Pharmingen and used at a concentration 
of 1:100 unless recommended otherwise by the manufacturer. Cells were then analyzed on a 
LSRII or MACSQuant flow cytometer (BD Biosciences and Miltenyi Biotec, respectively). 
As outlined in the individual figures, Th1 cells were defined as CD3+CD4+IFN-
g+IL-17−IL-10−Foxp3−, Th17 cells as CD3+CD4+IFN-g−IL-17+IL-10−Foxp3−, Treg cells as 
CD3+CD4+IFN-g−IL-17−IL-10−/+Foxp3+, microglia as CD11b+CD45lowLy6Clow, and pro-
inflammatory monocytes as CD45hiCD11b+Ly6Chi.

  RNA-sequencing
Mice were sacrificed at day 28 after disease induction and astrocytes isolated as described 
above. RNA was sequenced using the strand-specific TruSeq protocol. High coverage 
(>50M) strand-specific paired-end 76bp reads were aligned to the mm10/GRCm38 mouse 
reference genome using TopHat v2.0.1162. Gene expression levels were estimated for 38922 
GenCode Release M2 (GRCm38.p2) mouse gene annotations using Cuffquant and Cuffnorm 
v2.2.1 quartile normalized FPKMs and differential expression was assessed using Cuffdiff 
v2.2.162.
 nCounter gene expression
100 ng of total RNA was hybridized with reporter and capture probes in custom-made 
astrocyte-targeted nCounter Gene Expression code sets (Supplementary Table 1) according 
to manufacturer’s instructions (NanoString Technologies). Data were analyzed using 
nSolver Analysis software.
 qPCR
RNA was extracted with RNAeasy kit (Qiagen), cDNA was prepared and used for qPCR 
with the results normalized to Gapdh. All primers and probes were from Applied 
Biosystems. Mouse: Ahr Mm00478932_m1, Ccl20 Mm01268754_m1, Ccl2

 T cell proliferation
Splenocytes were cultured in X-VIVO 15 medium (Lonza) and were plated for 72 h at a 
density of 5 × 105 cells per well with increasing concentrations of MOG35–55 peptide. 
During the final 16 h, cells were pulsed with 1 Ci [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer), followed by 
collection on glass fiber filters and analysis of incorporated [3H]thymidine in a beta-counter 
(1450 MicroBeta TriLux; PerkinElmer). For intracellular cytokine staining, cells were 
stimulated for 4 h with PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; 50 ng/ml; Sigma), ionomycin 
(1 μg/ml; Sigma) and monensin (GolgiStop; 2 μM BD Biosciences). After staining of 
surface markers, cells were fixed and made permeable according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions (BD Cytofix/Cytoperm Kit (BD Biosciences) or Foxp3 Fixation/
Permeabilization (eBioscience).

  Primary astrocyte cultures
Cerebral cortices from neonatal mice aged 1–3 d were dissected, carefully stripped of their 
meninges, digested with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and DNAse I (1 mg/ml) for 15 mins, and 
dispersed to single-cell level by passing through a cell strainer (70 μm). The cell suspension 
was then cultured at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2, 95% air on poly-L-Lysin (Sigma) 
precoated 175 cm2 cell culture flasks. Medium was replaced every 4–5 d. After 7–10 d cells 
reached confluence and astrocytes were isolated by mild trypsinization with Trypsin-EDTA 
(0.06%) as previously described11. Cells were >95% astrocytes as determined by staining 
with GFAP or GLAST, with less than 5% contamination of CD11b+ microglia cells (not 
shown). After the isolation procedure, cells were further plated as required for the specific 
experiments. Concentrations of agents were 100 ng/ml for LPS (Sigma), 500 IU/ml for 
mIFN-β (R&D Systems), or 50 μg/ml 3-Indoxyl-sulfate (Sigma). Unless otherwise 
indicated, RNA analysis was done 24 h after start of treatment. For Western Blot, cells were 
pretreated with IFN-β or vehicle for 24 h, thereafter LPS was added and protein prepared 
after 2 h.
 Plasmids
Constructs encoding STAT1 and IRF-1 as well as pTK-Renilla were from Addgene. 
Reporter plasmids pAhR-Luc and pGud-Luc have been described before28. The pLenti-
GFAP-EGFP-mir30-shAct1 vector25 was a gift from Guang-Xian Zhang19.
 Transfections and luciferase assays
HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and transfected with 
Fugene-HD Transfection Reagent (Roche), reporter constructs (pAhR-Luc/pTK-Renilla or 
pGud-Luc/pTK Renilla) as well transcription factor expression constructs (pStat1, pIrf9) as 
indicated. In some experiments, transfected cells were exposed to 500 IU/ml of mIFN-β (Bio 
X cell) or AhR inhibitor CH223191 (Sigma). For the measurement of AhR ligands in human 
serum, 15.000 HEK293 cells were plated in 96 well plates 24 h before transfection with 
pGud-Luc and pTK-Renilla. After 24 h transfected cells were incubated with DMEM 
supplemented with 10% of patient serum. Luciferase activity was analyzed 24 h later using 
Dual Luciferase Reporter System (Promega) and normalized to Renilla luciferase activity.
 In vitro knockdown with shRNA
Ifnar1 expression was knocked down in mouse primary astrocytes in culture using a 
lentivirus vector carrying an Ifnar1-targeting shRNA (TRCN0000374694), a lentivirus 
carrying a non-targeting sequence was used as a control (TRCN0000018782) (Sigma). 
Astrocytes were incubated with lentiviruses and 8 μg/ml polybrene (both from Sigma-
Aldrich) for 24 h and thereafter incubated with mIFN-β (Bio-X-cell) or vehicle. GFP+ 
astrocytes were sorted, and gene knockdown was verified by qPCR. Transduction efficiency 
as determined by GFP-expression in transduced astrocytes was around 20% (Fig. 2b and not 
shown).

  In vivo astrocyte-specific knockdown with shRNA lentivirus
shRNA sequences against Ifnar1 or Ahr and a non-targeting control shRNA were cloned into 
the pLenti-GFAP-EGFP-mir30-shAct1 vector19 backbone by replacement of the shAct1 
with the above-mentioned in vitro validated shRNA sequence against Ifnar1 (5′-
CCGGGAATGAGGTTGATCCGTTTATCTCGAGATAAACGGATCAACCTCATTCTTTT
TG-3′) or Ahr (5′-
CCGGCATCGACATAACGGACGAAATCTCGAGATTTCGTCCGTTATGTCGATGTTTT
TG-3′) as previously described11. Lentivirus particles were generated by transfecting 
HEK293FT cells (Invitrogen) the newly generated pLenti-GFAP-EGFP-mir30-shRNA 
vectors and the ViraPower Packaging mix (helper plasmids pLP1, pLP2, pLP/VSV-G, 
Invitrogen). Supernatants were collected, filtered through a 0.45-μm PVDF filter, and 
concentrated overnight with the Lenti-X concentrator kit (Clontech). The viral titer was 
determined using the Lenti-X qRT-PCR titration kit (Clontech). For in vivo knockdown 
immunized mice were anesthetized at indicated time points, positioned in a Kopf Stereotaxic 
Alignment System and injected with 107 IU of shIfnar1 or shControl virus using a Hamilton 
syringe 0.44 mm posterior to the bregma, 1.0 mm lateral to it and 2.2 mm below the skull 
surface. The injection system was retracted slowly, skin incisions closed carefully by 
surgical sutures, and mice allowed to awake in a specific cage pre-warmed by red light and 
checked thrice daily thereafter.
 Subcellular fractionation and immunoblot analysis
In vitro astrocyte cultures were treated as indicated in specific experiments, subcellular 
fractions generated using Cell Fractionation kit (Cell Signaling) and 10 μg of nuclear and 
cytoplasmic fractions were separated by 4–12% Bis-Tris Nupage gels (Invitrogen, USA) and 
transferred onto PVDF membranes (Millipore). As primary antibodies we used rabbit anti- 
GAPDH mAb (14C10, Cell Signaling), anti-Histone H3 rabbit polyclonal Ab (EMD 
Millipore), anti-NF-κB p65 rabbit mAb (D14E12, Cell Signaling), followed by goat anti-
rabbit IgG HRP linked AB (7074S, Cell Signaling). All antibodies were used at a dilution of 
1:1.000. Blots were developed using the SuperSignal West Femto Maximum sensitivity kit 
(Thermo Scientific/Life Technologies). Data quantification was done using Image J software 
1.48v (NIH) and specific signals normalized to GAPDH (cytoplasm) or Histone 3 (nucleus).
 Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
Cells were cross-linked with 1% paraformaldehyde and lysed with 350 μl lysis buffer (1% 
SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) containing 1× protease inhibitor cocktail 
(Roche Molecular Biochemicals, USA). Chromatin was sheared by sonication and 
supernatants were collected after centrifugation and diluted in ChIP incubation buffer (1% 
Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). 10 μg of antibody 
was prebound for 6 h to protein A– and protein G–Dynal magnetic beads (Invitrogen, USA) 
and washed three times with ice-cold PBS plus 1% BSA, and then added to the diluted 
chromatin and immunoprecipitated rotating overnight. The magnetic bead-chromatin 
complexes were then washed 3 times in RIPA buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 1 mM 
EDTA, 0.7% Na deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 0.5 M LiCl) followed by 2 times with TE buffer. 
Immunoprecipitated chromatin was then extracted with 1% SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO3 and

purified with a QIAquick DNA purification kit (Qiagen, USA) and analyzed using the 
SYBR Green real-time PCR kit (Takara Bio Inc., USA). Anti-AhR (BML-SA210, Enzo Life 
Sciences, USA), anti-STAT1 (Cat. #9172, Cell Signaling Technology, USA), anti-STAT2 
(Cat. #4597, Cell Signaling Technology, USA), and NF-κB p65 (D14E12) XP Rabbit mAb 
(Cat. #8242, Cell Signaling Technology, USA) were used as indicated in specific 
experiments. The following primer pairs were used: ccl2:p65 forward, 5′-

 Generation of astrocyte conditioned media for migration and neurotoxicity assays
In vitro astrocyte cultures from WT or AhR-GFAP-deficient pups were treated with LPS 
(100 ng/ml) or vehicle for 24 hours, extensively washed and supplemented with fresh culture 
medium. 48 h later, supernatants were spun down and kept for migration and neurotoxicity 
assays at −80°C.
 Monocyte migration assay
Splenic monocytes from WT or IL-27R−/− mice were pre-enriched by CD11b beads 
(Miltenyi) and sorted for F4/80+SSClowLy-6Chi. These monocytes were seeded in the upper 
chamber of a 24-well cell culture insert with 5 μm pore-size (Corning) containing astrocyte 
preconditioned media (see above). In some experiments, the preconditioned media was 
supplemented with antibodies to IL-27 p28/IL-30 (Cat. AF1834), CCL2 (Clone 123616), M-
CSF (Clone 131621), GM-CSF (Clone MP122E9, all R&D Systems), or combinations of the 
latter. Migrating monocytes were quantified in the lower chamber after 3 h.
 Neurotoxicity assay
N2A Neuronal cells (ATCC CCL-131, ATCC, Manassas) were grown in 96 Well-plates and 
pre-activated with mIFN-γ (100 ng/ml, R&D Systems) for 24 h. Thereafter, medium was 
replaced after extensive washes with PBS with astrocyte-conditioned media. Cytotoxicity 
was measured using LDH release (CytoTox 96® Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay, 
Promega) after 24 h as suggested by manufacturer’s protocol.

  Measurement of urinary I3S
Urinary indican (I3S) was measured using the Indican Assay Kit (MAK128, Sigma Aldrich) 
in undiluted urine samples.
 Measurement of CNS serotonin levels
50 mg of minced CNS tissue was resuspended in 200 μl of PBS and homogenized by 
sonication. After spinning down the extract to clear cellular debris serotonin levels were 
measured in the supernatant using the Serotonin Research Elisa Kit (Cat. BA E-5900, LDN 
Immunoassays, Germany).
 Quantification of Lactobacillus reuteri DNA in mouse feces
Bacterial DNA in 200 mg of fecal samples from EAE mice was purified using QIAamp 
DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen) and subjected to SYBR Green qPCR using primers specific to 
Lactobacillus reuteri as previously published44. Lactobacillus reuteri primers were used as 
follows: Forward: 5′-ACCGAGAACACCGCGTTATTT-3′, Reverse: 5′-
CATAACTTAACCAAACAATCAAAGATTGTCT-3′. Relative abundances were normalized 
to the control group (TDD+Trp).
 Human primary astrocytes
Human fetal astrocytes were isolated as previously described11,63 from human CNS tissue 
from fetuses at 17–23 weeks of gestation obtained from the Human Fetal Tissue Repository 
(Albert Einstein College of Medicine) following Canadian Institutes of Health Research–
approved guidelines. Primary human astrocytes were treated with hIFN-β (500 IU, Rebif, 
Merck Serono) or vehicle, poly(I:C) (10 mg/ml) with or without 3-indoxyl-sulfate (50 μM, 
Sigma) or untreated (control). After 24 h, total RNA was isolated, transcribed and subjected 
to qPCR.
 MS tissue and Immunofluorescence
Brain tissue was obtained from untreated individuals with clinically diagnosed MS and 
neuropathologically confirmed MS, and healthy controls as previously described11,64. All 
MS individuals and controls, or their next of kin, had given informed consent for autopsy 
and use of their brain tissue for research purposes. Ethical approval was given before 
autopsy (CHUM ethical approval: SL05.022 and SL05.023 and BH07.001). MS samples 
were processed and immunostained as previously described2. Briefly, sections were thawed, 
fixed, washed and blocked with donkey serum 10%. Sections were then incubated overnight 
at 4oC with antibodies against AhR (rabbit anti AhR, Enzo Life Sciences) and CCL2 (mouse 
anti MCP-1, BD Biosciences) or iNOS (mouse anti iNOS – Abcam). After washes the 
samples were incubated at room temperature for 40 minutes with the secondary antibodies 
(Donkey anti rabbit RRX and donkey anti mouse Alexa 488, Jackson ImmunoResearch). 
Sections were then incubated with anti-GFAP antibody directly conjugated with Alexa 647 
(BD Biosciences) for 1h. In other staining set, the sections were incubated overnight at 4°C 
with antibodies against AhR (rabbit anti AhR, Enzo Life Sciences) and Mx1 (mouse anti 
Mx1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or pSTAT1 (mouse anti pSTAT1 – BD Biosciences). 
Sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies and anti-GFAP-Alexa 647 as

 indicated above. Finally, all the sections were washed and mounted in gelvatol containing 
TOPRO-3 (Invitrogen). Imaging was performed using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope and 
the Leica LAS AF software. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS2. For 
imaging analysis all the data were acquired using the same settings, which were originally 
standardized on NAWM sections. The degree of co-localization of AhR with CCL2, iNOS, 
Mx1, pSTAT1 and GFAP as well as GFAP with CCL2, iNOS, Mx1 and pSTAT1 was 
determined using the Leica LAS software. The overlap coefficient is expressed in percentage 
where 100% represents the maximum degree of colocalization and 0% denotes no 
colocalization.
 Serum metabolite analysis
Serum samples were collected at the University of Sevilla from healthy controls (11) and 
individuals with MS (49 MS). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of 
Brigham and Women’s Hospital and all subjects provided written informed consent. 
Tryptophan and tryptophan metabolites were profiled using two targeted LC-MS-based 
metabolomics methods as described previously65. Briefly, tryptophan, kynurenine, 
kynurenic acid and anthranilic acid were measured in the positive ion mode using a 4000 
QTRAP triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX, Framingham MA) coupled to a 
1200 Series binary HPLC pump (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and an HTS PAL autosampler 
(Leap Technologies, Carrboro, NC). Serum samples (10μL) were extracted using nine 
volumes of 74.9:24.9:0.2 (v/v/v) acetonitrile/methanol/formic acid containing stable isotope-
labeled internal standards (0.2 ng/μL valine-d8, Isotec; and 0.2 ng/μL phenylalanine-d8 
(Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., Tewksbury MA)). The samples were centrifuged (10 
min, 9,000 × g, 4°C) and the supernatants (10 μL) injected onto a 150 × 2.1 mm Atlantis 
HILIC column (Waters). The column was eluted isocratically at a flow rate of 250 μL/min 
with 5% mobile phase A (10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid in water) for 1 
minute followed by a linear gradient to 40% mobile phase B (acetonitrile with 0.1% formic 
acid) over 10 minutes. The ion spray voltage was 4.5 kV and the source temperature was 
450°C. Kynurenine was measured in the negative ion mode using an ACQUITY UPLC 
(Waters Corp, Milford MA) coupled to a 5500 QTRAP triple quadrupole mass spectrometer 
(AB SCIEX, Framingham MA). Serum samples (30μL) were extracted using 120 μL of 80% 
methanol containing 0.05 ng/μL inosine-15N4, 0.05 ng/μL thymine-d4, and 0.1 ng/μL 
glycocholate-d4 as internal standards (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., Tewksbury 
MA). The samples were centrifuged (10 min, 9,000 × g, 4°C) and the supernatants (10 μL) 
were injected directly onto a 150 × 2.0 mm Luna NH2 column (Phenomenex, Torrance CA). 
The column was eluted at a flow rate of 400 μL/min with initial conditions of 10% mobile 
phase A (20 mM ammonium acetate and 20 mM ammonium hydroxide (Sigma-Aldrich) in 
water (VWR)) and 90% mobile phase B (10 mM ammonium hydroxide in 75:25 v/v 
acetonitrile/methanol (VWR)) followed by a 10 min linear gradient to 100% mobile phase 
A. The ion spray voltage was −4.5 kV and the source temperature was 500°C. Raw data 
were processed using MultiQuant 1.2 software (AB SCIEX, Framingham MA) for 
automated peak integration. Metabolite peaks were manually reviewed for quality of 
integration and compared against standard reference standards to confirm identities.

  Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with Prism software (GraphPad) using the statistical 
tests indicated in the individual figure legends. No sample size estimate was performed, but 
samples size was selected based on previous experiments. No samples were excluded. The 
investigators were blinded as to the treatment of mice in individual experiments. P values of 
<0.05 were considered significant. All error bars represent s.e.m. or SD as noted in the 
individual figure legends. Unless otherwise stated, ≥3 independent experiments were used 
for all assays and displayed figures are representative.
