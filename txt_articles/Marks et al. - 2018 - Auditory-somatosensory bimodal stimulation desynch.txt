The dorsal cochlear nucleus is the first site of multisensory convergence in mammalian auditory pathways. Principal 
output neurons, the fusiform cells, integrate auditory nerve inputs from the cochlea with somatosensory inputs 
from the head and neck. In previous work, we developed a guinea pig model of tinnitus induced by noise exposure and 
showed that the fusiform cells in these animals exhibited increased spontaneous activity and cross-unit synchrony, 
which are physiological correlates of tinnitus. We delivered repeated bimodal auditory-somatosensory stimulation to 
the dorsal cochlear nucleus of guinea pigs with tinnitus, choosing a stimulus interval known to induce long-term 
depression (LTD). Twenty minutes per day of LTD-inducing bimodal (but not unimodal) stimulation reduced phys-
iological and behavioral evidence of tinnitus in the guinea pigs after 25 days. Next, we applied the same bimodal 
treatment to 20 human subjects with tinnitus using a double-blinded, sham-controlled, crossover study. Twenty- 
eight days of LTD-inducing bimodal stimulation reduced tinnitus loudness and intrusiveness. Unimodal auditory 
stimulation did not deliver either benefit. Bimodal auditory-somatosensory stimulation that induces LTD in the 
dorsal cochlear nucleus may hold promise for suppressing chronic tinnitus, which reduces quality of life for millions of 
tinnitus sufferers worldwide.
INTRODUCTION
Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in the absence of external 
stimuli, is a disorder that affects 15% of the population in the United 
States (1) and is the most prevalent service-connected disability for 
military personnel (2). Whereas some individuals are minimally 
disturbed by their tinnitus, about 10% are bothered by it, and about 
2 million individuals are debilitated (1). Negative impacts of tinnitus 
include sleep disturbance, poor concentration, distress, depression, 
and anxiety (1, 3). Current tinnitus therapies are more successful at 
managing a patient’s reaction to their percept rather than addressing 
the tinnitus, and no one therapy is effective for all patients. Even 
when improving quality of life, none of the available tinnitus therapies 
treat the underlying pathology, and few have reported reductions in 
tinnitus loudness (4). A treatment that targets the underlying tinnitus 
mechanisms would greatly improve clinical outcomes for patients.
Whereas tinnitus is commonly associated with acoustic over-
exposure, many patients with tinnitus have clinically normal audio-
metric thresholds (5, 6), and about 12% report a triggering event 
such as a tooth abscess or head and neck injury precipitating their 
tinnitus (7), indicating that events in addition to acoustic trauma 
can modify neural activity in auditory pathways. Indeed, 60 to 80% 
of tinnitus sufferers display a somatosensory component to their 
tinnitus, evident in their ability to modulate their tinnitus pitch or 
loudness by moving or applying pressure to their head or neck (8).
Tinnitus is thought to arise from dysregulated neural synchrony 
across neural ensembles along the auditory pathway (9), beginning 
in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) (10). The DCN is the first 
central site for multisensory integration, receiving input from the 
auditory nerve, auditory midbrain, auditory cortex, trigeminal and 
cervical ganglia, spinal trigeminal nucleus, and dorsal column nuclei 
(11–13). After noise exposure sufficient to temporarily elevate hearing 
thresholds, spontaneous activity and cross-neural synchrony of DCN 
output neurons, the fusiform cells, are increased in animals showing 
behavioral evidence of tinnitus. Animals without behavioral evidence 
of tinnitus do not show these neural correlates (14). Further, the tinnitus- 
related neural changes can occur even in the absence of permanent 
shifts in behavioral audiometric thresholds or electrophysiological 
measures of peripheral hearing status (14, 15).
The DCN produces hypersynchronous output through its unique, 
cerebellar-like circuit (fig. S1). In this circuit, auditory nerve fibers from 
the cochlea form synapses with the fusiform cell basal dendrites, whereas 
the nonauditory (for example, somatosensory) inputs are relayed by 
granule cell axons that form synapses with the fusiform cell apical den-
drites (16). The apical dendritic synapses display spike timing–dependent 
plasticity in which repeated elicitation of presynaptic excitatory post-
synaptic potentials (EPSPs) followed by post 
synaptic spikes produce 
long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas postsynaptic spikes followed 
by presynaptic EPSPs produce long-term depression (LTD) in vitro 
(17). In vivo, auditory (sound) stimulation can be used to evoke post-
synaptic spikes, and somatosensory stimulation can be used to evoke 
presynaptic activity in fusiform cells, such that paired auditory- 
somatosensory stimulation produces long-term changes in fusiform 
cell firing rates. In vivo, the resulting long-term effects are termed 
“stimulus timing–dependent plasticity” (STDP). Whether LTP or LTD 
occurs depends on the precise order and timing between the bimodal 
stimuli (15). These “learning rules” are altered after noise exposure so 
that animals with tinnitus show a broader range of stimulus intervals 
that evoke LTP, have broader range OF intervals that evoke LTD (18). 
Theoretical models of feedforward networks predict that LTP-driven 
synaptic strengthening will increase circuit connectivity and result 
in hypersynchrony (19). Hypersynchrony can also be driven by inhibitory

network components (20), such as the cartwheel cells in the DCN 
(fig. S1), which are also subjected to spike timing–dependent syn-
aptic modulation (17). Thus, increased LTP in the fusiform cell cir-
cuit could contribute to the hypersynchrony and increased sponta-
neous activity that are considered neural correlates of tinnitus (14).
Here, using a guinea pig model, we determined whether enhanced 
LTP and reduced LTD in the fusiform cell circuit initiated hyper-
synchrony, resulting in behavioral evidence of tinnitus. We show, 
in vivo, that auditory-somatosensory stimulation strengthened or 
weakened neural synchrony between fusiform cells, depending on 
the bimodal stimulus order and timing. Furthermore, in animals 
with tinnitus, enhanced LTP correlated with increased synchrony and 
spontaneous activity in fusiform cells. To counteract tinnitus, we 
stimulated guinea pigs with repeated auditory-somatosensory bimodal 
stimulation for 20 min/day for 25 days, choosing a bimodal interval 
shown to produce LTD in the fusiform cell circuit. This noninvasive 
approach resulted in decreased synchrony and spontaneous activity 
in fusiform cells and reduced behavioral evidence of tinnitus. Fur-
thermore, neither unimodal sound nor unimodal somatosensory 
stimulation reliably decreased behavioral or physiological evidence 
of tinnitus in these animals. These findings demonstrated that fusi-
form cell spike timing–dependent plasticity may play a fundamental 
role in regulating neural synchrony and perception and that LTD 
could be harnessed to reverse pathological hypersynchrony to reduce 
tinnitus.
Then, using stimulus protocols determined by the preclinical ani-
mal experiments, we conducted a similar study in 20 human partici-
pants with somatic tinnitus using a double-blinded, sham- 
controlled, 
crossover design. We reasoned that, because the human cochlear nu-
cleus contains the cellular elements present in the DCN of rodents 
(21), similar learning rules should be present in humans and guinea 
pigs. We demonstrated that bimodal auditory-somatosensory stim-
ulation, but not unimodal auditory stimulation, effectively reduced 
tinnitus loudness and intrusiveness cumulatively over the 4 weeks of 
treatment.
RESULTS
STDP regulates synchrony among DCN fusiform cells in 
guinea pigs
To test the role of STDP in regulating synchronous firing among 
fusiform cells in the DCN, we recorded spontaneous spiking activity 
from single fusiform cells in anesthetized normal-hearing guinea 
pigs before and 15 min after bimodal stimulation (Fig. 1A). Bimodal 
stimulation consisted of sounds (tone bursts near the unit best fre-
quency) and transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the neck, pre-
sented within a ±20-ms interstimulus window (Fig. 1A). Six bimodal 
intervals were studied (sound preceding electrical stimulus by 5, 10, 
or 20 ms or electrical stimulus preceding sound by 5, 10, or 20 ms) 
in a separate series in a randomized order; physiological measurements 
preceded and followed each series (see table S1 for STDP learning 
rule types across unit/unit pairs). To quantify synchronous firing, we 
measured peak cross-correlation coefficients between spontaneous 
spike trains from fusiform cell pairs (Fig. 1B). In one representative 
unit pair, the peak cross-correlation coefficient decreased (Fig. 1C, 
top) after auditory-preceding-somatosensory stimulation (−10-ms 
interval) but increased after somatosensory-preceding- 
auditory stim-
ulation (10-ms interval; Fig. 1C, bottom). This unit pair exhibited a 
Hebbian-like learning rule (Fig. 1D) in which presynaptic, subthresh-
old activation of the parallel fibers by somatosensory stimulation fol-
lowed by postsynaptic activation of the basal dendrites by auditory 
stimulation (sound) strengthened neural synchrony. In other unit pairs 
(for example, Fig. 1, E and F), the learning rule was anti–Hebbian-like, 
where the same bimodal interstimulus interval as Fig. 1C produced neu-
ral synchrony changes in the opposite direction. Other unit pairs exhib-
ited LTP-only learning rules (where all bimodal inter 
vals strengthened 
synchrony) or LTD-only learning rules (where all bimodal intervals 
weakened synchrony).

Fig. 1. STDP regulates synchrony in fusiform cells of the guinea pig DCN. 
(A) Spontaneous activity (SA) was recorded across the fusiform cell (FC) population 
in 25 guinea pigs for 150 s, followed by 60 s (5 Hz) of bimodal stimulation (BIS) with 
bimodal intervals (BI) from −20 to +20 ms. SA was recorded again 15 min after BIS 
for 150 s. (B) Synchrony was assessed by cross-correlations (x-corr) of spikes in FC 
pairs (FC1 and FC2). SA of FCs shows Poisson distributions in interspike interval 
histograms (ISIHs). Synchronous unit pairs are defined by threshold cross-correlation 
coefficients (x-corr coef) of 4 SD (dashed line). (C) In one representative FC unit pair, 
a BI of −10 ms (auditory preceding somatosensory stimulus by 10 ms; pink) re-
duced the peak x-corr coef (top), whereas a BI of 10 ms (somatosensory preceding 
auditory stimulus by 10 ms; blue) increased the peak x-corr coef 15 min after BIS 
(bottom). (D) Changes in peak x-corr coef for the FC unit pair in (C) are plotted as a 
function of BI (learning rule). (E) In a different FC unit pair, a BI of −10 ms increased 
peak x-corr coef (top), whereas a BI of 10 ms decreased peak x-corr coef 15 min af-
ter BIS (bottom). (F) For the FC unit pair in (E), changes in x-corr coef after BIS were 
opposite to that for the FC unit pair in (D).

STDP contributes to tinnitus-related hypersynchrony, we induced 
tinnitus in guinea pigs using noise exposure and assessed tinnitus 
using gap-prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle (GPIAS) response. 
GPIAS measures the acoustic startle response in the presence of a 
background narrow-band noise. When a gap is inserted into the 
background noise before the startle stimulus, the startle response is 
reduced in normal animals. However, in animals with tinnitus, the 
tinnitus obscures the gap, and there is no decrement in the startle 
response. By plotting the amplitude of the gap trials versus the no-
gap trials, an estimate of the animals’ tinnitus is obtained (see fig. S4) 
(15, 22, 23). Noise exposure produced only temporary hearing threshold 
elevations, which recovered after a few days (fig. S3), but resulted in 
chronic tinnitus in 16 of 22 (72.7%) guinea pigs after 8 weeks (fig. 
S4). Noise-exposed animals with tinnitus [ex 
posed with tinnitus 
(ET)] exhibited significant increases in synchrony [one-way analysis 
of variance (ANOVA), F(2) = 14.9, P = 2.3 × 10−6, post hoc P < 0.05; 
Fig. 2A] and spontaneous activity [F(2) = 17.5, P = 3.0 × 10−7, post 
hoc P < 0.05; Fig. 2B) across the fusiform cell population compared 
to normal-hearing animals and the 27.3% of noise- 
exposed animals 
that did not develop tinnitus [exposed no tinnitus (ENT)]. STDP for 
synchrony was assessed and compared across the tinnitus, no-tinnitus, 
and normal- 
hearing groups. The tinnitus group exhibited a greater 
proportion of unit pairs with LTP-only learning rules, whereas the 
normal- 
hearing and the non-tinnitus groups exhibited greater pro-
portions of anti-Hebbian–like and LTD-only learning rules (Fig. 2C 
and table S1) [2
(3) = 15.8, P = 0.0013]. STDP for spontaneous activ-
ity of single units followed a similar trend (Fig. 2D) [2
(3) = 23.4, 
P = 3.3 × 10−5]. To further quantify the learning rule distribution 
shift from LTD toward LTP, we compared the LTD-LTP index 
(Fig. 2E, inset), which sums all positive/LTP integration phases and 
all negative/LTD phases across all unit pairs or single units (see 
Fig. 2E for synchrony and Fig. 2F for spontaneous activity). The tin-
nitus group showed more LTPs across all learning- 
rule types, 
whereas the no-tinnitus group showed more LTD compared to the 
normal-hearing group [F(2) = 10.33, P = 5.3 × 10−5 for synchrony; 
F(2) = 91.7, P = 1.6 × 10−37 for spontaneous activity]. These findings 
indicated that the tinnitus-driven circuit had a high probability for 
LTP and strengthened neural synchrony.
Bimodal (but not unimodal) stimulation induces LTD to 
reduce fusiform cell synchrony and spontaneous activity
Given that increased synchrony and spontaneous activity correlated 
with an expansion of the LTP phase of the STDP learning rule, we 
hypothesized that inducing LTD would reduce synchrony and spon-
taneous activity. First, we determined the bimodal interval that pro-
duced the strongest LTD in the animals with tinnitus by quantifying 
LTD probability (overall proportion of units showing LTD at a given 
bimodal interval). We found that more units responded with decreased 
synchrony and spontaneous activity after bimodal stimulation in-
tervals of −5 and −10 ms. Whereas ±20-ms intervals showed slight 
deviation from 0.5, they were not different from chance (Fig. 3A). 
Suppression of synchrony and spontaneous activity after −5-ms bi-
modal stimulation was significantly greater (due to less variance) than 
unimodal auditory or unimodal somatosensory stimulation, neither 
of which produced long-term effects [one-way ANOVA, F(2) = 11.3, 
P = 1.1 × 10−6 for synchrony; F(2) = 142, P = 5.4 × 10−66 for sponta-
neous activity; Fig. 3, B and C].
We next asked whether reducing syn-
chrony in the fusiform cell circuit would 
affect the animal’s tinnitus behavior. We 
hypothesized that repeated bimodal stim-
ulation with an LTD-inducing interval 
(−5 ms) would reduce synchrony and 
spontaneous activity as well as behavioral 
evidence of tinnitus. Unimodal auditory 
stimulation, on the other hand, should 
not induce LTD because auditory synapses 
on the basal dendrites are not plastic; 
somatosensory input alone has been shown 
to induce LTP (15, 18). To test this hypo 
th-
esis, we treated guinea pigs with tinnitus 
with 20-min daily sessions of bimodal 
stimulation consisting of an 8-kHz tone 
burst (the frequency at which tinnitus was 
most prevalent; see fig. S4) paired with 
transcutaneous stimulation at the −5-ms 
interval for 25 days (ET-treat group). 
Three control groups were used, all ex-
pressing tinnitus after noise exposure. A 
sham group received a sedative but no 
bimodal or unimodal stimulation (ET- 
sham); an auditory-only group received 
the same 8-kHz tone but did not receive 
transcutaneous somatosensory stimula-
tion (ET-audio); and a somatosensory- 
only 
group received only electrical stimulation 
(ET-som). After the 25-day treatment

period, we quantified tinnitus behavior in the four groups using the 
tinnitus index (TI), which compared gap startle responses normalized 
to the preexposure baseline before and after noise exposure (fig. S4). 
Representative findings presented in Fig. 4A (one animal per group) 
show increased normalized startle responses after noise exposure, 
indicating tinnitus, which was reduced after treatment only in the 
animal receiving bimodal stimulation (ET-treat). Group analysis pre-
sented in Fig. 4B showed that, compared to the pretreatment TI, 
animals receiving bimodal stimulation (ET-treat) exhibited a signif-
icant reduction in the TI at the treated frequency of 8 kHz and not 
at other tinnitus frequencies, whereas the sham group (ET-sham) and 
the auditory-only group (ET-audio) showed no changes [two-way 
ANOVA, F(2,1) = 3.70, P = 0.0069 for frequency × group). The 
somatosensory-only group (ET-som) showed a small decrease in TI 
at one frequency and a large increase in TI in another frequency but 
no significant group mean change from control (post hoc P > 0.05). 
Tinnitus reduction correlated with lower neural synchrony [Pearson’s 
linear correlation: r(287) = 0.15, P = 0.010; correction of dependency 
using linear mixed-effect model: P = 0.031; Fig. 4C] and lower spon-
taneous activity [r(1125) = 0.20, P = 6.8 × 10−12; correction of depen-
dency using linear mixed-effect model: P = 0.0011; Fig. 4D]. Together, 
these results demonstrate that targeted LTD induction in guinea pigs 
reduced tinnitus produced by dysregulated STDP, increased neuro-
nal synchrony, and spontaneous activity.
Bimodal (but not unimodal) auditory-somatosensory 
stimulation reduces tinnitus loudness in humans
The positive animal study outcomes prompted the investigation of 
bimodal treatment for humans suffering from tinnitus. A double- 
blinded, sham-controlled, crossover study was used to evaluate the 
effectiveness of bimodal auditory-somatosensory stimulation as a 
tinnitus treatment. All subjects and investigators were blinded as to 
whether subjects received an active (bimodal) or sham (unimodal- 
auditory) treatment for the duration of the study. Upon enrollment, 
participants were first assigned to either a sham group (n = 10, 
group 1) or an active bimodal treatment group (n = 10, group 2; 
Fig. 5). Assignment was by a random number list that was precom-
puted before the start of the study. Take-home devices were pro-
grammed to deliver the bimodal or unimodal treatment protocols 
by control software and data were encrypted to ensure blinding. The 
sound stimuli were delivered through calibrated insert earphones, 
and the electrical (somatosensory) stimuli were administered using 
Ag-AgCl cups placed on the skin of the cervical spine or the cheek. 
Participants used the devices for 30 min once a day for two 4-week 
sessions with a 4-week washout period after each session. After the 
washout period, subjects “crossed over” to receive the other treat-
ment for the second 4-week period so that all subjects received both 
active and sham treatments. Participants returned to the laboratory 
weekly for monitoring and tinnitus assessment: loudness was as-
sessed by matching tinnitus loudness to an external sound using 
TinnTester software, and intrusiveness was assessed using the Tin-
nitus Functional Index (TFI; see Material and Methods).
The auditory stimulus (the same for bimodal and sham) was de-
rived from each individual’s tinnitus spectrum and audiogram (fig. S5, 
see Materials and Methods). Devices provided either bimodal (auditory- 
electric) stimulation (bimodal active treatment) or unimodal (auditory 
alone) stimulation (sham treatment) for 30 min a day for 28 days. The 
bimodal interval was the same as that shown to be effective in the 
guinea pigs (−5 ms). Somatosensory stimulation alone was not pro-
vided because the animal study (Figs. 3B and 4, A and B) indicated 
that it could exacerbate the tinnitus.
The active bimodal treatment produced a significant (P < 0.05) 
cumulative decrease in tinnitus loudness assessed by TinnTester 
loudness matching each week of the active treatment (Fig. 6A). The 
greatest mean change in loudness occurred after the fourth and final 
week of treatment. In contrast, loudness was stable (unchanged) during 
sham treatment for both groups. There was no significant difference 
between groups 1 and 2 (P = 0.88), demonstrating that treatment 
order had no effect. Pooled groups showed a mean decrease of 8.035 ± 
1.33 dB from a baseline of 54.42 ± 13.3 dB in loudness matches 
during the 4 weeks of active treatment [two-way ANOVA, F(3,1) 7.768, 
post hoc P = 5.5 × 10−5], significantly larger than the changes seen 
in the other conditions (sham, active washout, and sham washout) 
where changes from baseline were not significant (Fig. 6B). Tinnitus

reduction reached an average of 12.2 dB in the fourth week of active 
treatment. Of the 20 participants tested, 2 reported complete elimi-
nation of their tinnitus toward the end of the active treatment period.
Bimodal (but not unimodal) stimulation improves TFI scores
Mean overall TFI scores decreased from baseline of 29.2 ± 2.6 to 
22.9 ± 1.8 units during the active treatment but remained un-
changed during the sham treatment (Fig. 6C). Improvements in 
TFI scores were sustained beyond the active treatment and into the 
washout period, unlike the changes in loudness matching. Because 
treatment order also had no significant effect on TFI scores [general 
linear mixed models (GLMM); P = 0.819], both groups were pooled 
for statistical analysis. The mean TFI scores across the different 
study periods (Fig. 6D) were significantly improved (that is, reduced 
relative to baseline) for both active and active washout periods (but 
not sham periods) [7.33 ± 0.956 TFI units; two-way ANOVA, F(3,1) = 
7.712, P = 6.14 × 10−5), indicating a di-
minished impact on daily life with mean 
reductions of 7.51 and 6.71 points, re-
spectively. Eleven participants noted sub-
jective changes in volume, pitch, or 
quality that resulted in their tinnitus 
becoming less “harsh” or “piercing” and 
more “mellow.” Even participants who 
did not experience a complete elimina-
tion of their tinnitus reported anecdotally 
that their tinnitus was noticeably less ob-
trusive and easier to ignore.
Ten of the 20 subjects had a clinically 
significant reduction of at least 13 points 
in their TFI scores during active treat-
ment, which is considered clinically mean-
i 
ngful for this questionnaire (24). There 
were no demographic differences across 
subjects showing significant TFI changes 
compared to stable subjects (table S2). 
Four participants had clinically significant 
drops during the sham treatment, but 
two of these also showed significant de-
creases in TFI during the active treatment. 
Further, both participants reported that 
their tinnitus improved more during the 
active treatment. The two participants 
who stated that the sham treatment was 
more effective also had the shortest tin-
nitus duration (less than 1 year).
Reductions in loudness relative to 
baseline correlated significantly with re-
ductions in overall TFI scores (linear mixed- 
effects model: β = 0.169 ± 0.058, T = 
2.94, P = 0.0035; fig. S7). Furthermore, 
changes in loudness correlated with changes 
in TFI subscores: sense of control, intrusive, 
cognitive, and sleep (table S3).
DISCUSSION
Increases in synchrony, spontaneous 
activity and bursting (14), and altered 
STDP (15) are established neural cor-
relates of tinnitus. In animal models of tinnitus, increased synchrony 
has been identified in the DCN (14), inferior colliculus (25), and 
auditory cortex (26). These studies suggest that the tinnitus percept 
emerges from increased spontaneous synchrony among neurons in 
cortical and subcortical regions that contribute to perceptual binding 
(the process of merging individual pieces of sensory information 
into coherent representations) (27). Here, we first examined the re-
lationship between synchrony and STDP in normal-hearing guinea 
pigs, which exhibited Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning rules as 
well as rules giving LTP or LTD. We then induced tinnitus in animals 
using noise exposure that produced only temporary threshold shifts 
and observed tinnitus-related increases in neural activity reflecting 
an overall dominance of LTP. Subsequently, we applied the optimal 
bimodal interval to induce LTD in sessions of 20-min duration for 
25 days, which reversed hypersynchrony and behavioral evidence of

Fig. 4. LTD-induction reduces synchrony and spontaneous activity and reduces tinnitus in guinea pigs. (A) Four 
representative animals (one from each group) showed increased normalized startles (norm. startle) after noise exposure 
[from pre-exposure (pre-exp) to post-exposure (post-exp)] indicating tinnitus (left ordinate), quantified as the TI 
(right ordinate). After LTD induction by application of a bimodal auditory-somatosensory stimulus to the fusiform 
cells (ET-treat), there was a reduction in TI in the treated animal (ET-treat). Sham-treated (ET-sham; sedative only), 
auditory stimulus–only (ET-audio), and somatosensory stimulus–only (ET-som) animals showed either no reduction 
in TI or worsened TI. (B) Mean TI was significantly reduced in the ET-treat group at the treated frequency (on-freq; 8 kHz) 
but not at the untreated frequencies (off-freq; 12 and 16 kHz). TI was not significantly reduced in the ET-sham, ET-audio, 
or ET-som groups. Pink horizontal bar indicates the 95% CI for the ET-sham group. (C) The weighted mean cross- 
correlation coefficient (x-corr) for FCs (at best frequencies within the TI bandwidth) is plotted as a function of TI (116, 
36, 35, and 106 unit pairs for the ET-sham, ET-audio, ET-som, and ET-treat groups, respectively). Gray area indicates 
the range of x-corr for nonexposed animals. Reduction in synchrony significantly correlated with TI reduction. (D) SA 
plotted as a function of TI (446, 204, 202, and 696 units). Reduction in SA significantly correlated with TI reduction.

tinnitus at frequencies corresponding to the treatment frequency. 
None of the control stimuli (sedative alone, unimodal somatosensory, 
or unimodal auditory stimulation) had any effect on tinnitus behaviors 
or tinnitus correlates. On the basis of the outcome of the animal 
study, we used the same bimodal stimulus protocol to treat tinnitus 
in humans.
STDP is essential for shaping sensory perception through input- 
dependent learning. In the visual cortex, STDP modulates tuning of 
visual neurons to orientation and motion (28). Similar STDP pro-
cesses shape map plasticity in the somatosensory and auditory cor-
tices for frequency selectivity, pitch encoding, and discrimination 
(29–31). These context-dependent changes in sensory processing 
can alter connectivity and synchrony of neural ensembles (32, 33). 
In the fusiform cell circuit, multimodal inputs induce context- 
dependent changes through STDP (34). Auditory-somatosensory 
integration in DCN constitutes an adaptive filtering process through 
which perception of behaviorally relevant sounds is amplified and 
internally generated sounds are attenuated (17, 35, 36). Fusiform 
cell synchrony regulation by STDP likely contributes to this perceptual 
task, whereas dysregulated multimodal STDP gives rise to phantom 
perception, as we show here.
Synaptic plasticity has been suggested as a foundation for network- 
level homeostatic adaptation (37). In the fusiform cell circuit, glutamatergic 
inputs to the granule cell–parallel fiber circuit are up-regulated after hear-
ing loss (38–40), resulting in increases in LTP (41). This homeo 
static 
mechanism in response to altered input is not exclusive to the auditory 
pathway (42). After light deprivation, visual-cortical neurons exhibit ex-
pansion in STDP due to increased N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) re-
ceptor activation (43). Blocking NMDA receptors in the fusiform cell 
circuit reduces neural synchrony (44). Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, 
whose expression is up-regulated after noise ex 
posure (45), also contrib-
ute to STdP (46, 47).
STDP can affect intrinsic membrane excitability by altering ion 
channel conductance (48, 49). Maladaptive changes to fusiform cell 
plasticity that decrease inhibition through reduced hyperpolarizing 
currents could also contribute to increased synchrony and sponta-
neous activity. Reduced potassium channel activation and reduced 
glycine and GABA (-aminobutyric acid) receptor activation of fusi-
form cells have been demonstrated in tinnitus models (50, 51). A 
major source of GABA input and glycinergic input to fusiform cells 
arises in cartwheel cells (fig. S1). These DCN interneurons, which 
receive parallel-fiber synapses that exhibit STDP (17), provide recur-
rent inhibitory synapses onto fusiform 
cells. Cartwheel cells, therefore, may play 
an essential role in generating fusiform 
cell synchrony (19, 20). Another poten-
tial player, the Golgi cell in the marginal 
region of the cochlear nucleus, provides 
feedback modulation of granule cell out-
put, which may entrain parallel fibers into 
synchronized firing (52–54). These net-
work components are likely to work to-
gether to increase synchrony in fusiform 
cells, thus potentially playing important 
roles in tinnitus.
Because the human cochlear nucleus 
contains all of the cellular elements pre-
sent in the DCN of rodents (21), we rea-
soned that the same bimodal protocol 
might suppress tinnitus in humans. In both 
the animal and the human studies, bi-
modal but not unimodal auditory stim-
ulation effectively suppressed tinnitus. 
The documented failure of unimodal au-
ditory stimulation to produce long-term 
changes in fusiform cell firing rates pre-
dicted that unimodal auditory stimulation 
would be inefficient at reducing tinnitus 
(15, 18, 34, 55). The significant reduc-
tion in tinnitus in animals and tinnitus 
loudness and distress in humans suggests

that the bimodal treatment was successful at inducing frequency- 
specific LTD, reversing the pathological neural activity responsible 
for the generation of tinnitus.
Unimodal auditory treatment, in addition to being ineffective at 
reducing tinnitus during the sham treatment phase, tended to cause 
an increase in tinnitus loudness and TFI scores at the end of the sham 
treatment, possibly due to the increased attention paid to the tinnitus 
during the evaluation periods. Unimodal somatosensory stimulation, 
on the other hand, shown to cause LTP and not LTD in animal studies 
(15, 18, 34), predicted that unimodal somatosensory stimulation 
could exacerbate tinnitus. Unimodal somatosensory stimulation did 
exacerbate the tinnitus in some animals, preventing us from testing 
the electrical-only stimulation condition in humans.
Bimodal auditory-somatosensory stimulation in humans had no 
side effects, whereas invasive techniques such as deep brain stimula-
tion and vagal nerve stimulation can have severe side effects. Our 
LTD induction approach is noninvasive, easy to implement, and 
presents minimal risk. Although reduced tinnitus loudness did not 
carry over into the washout period, this benefit was persistent enough 
to accumulate over several days of treatment. Improved adjustment 
to tinnitus, as reflected in the TFI scores, persisted during the washout 
period, for up to 3 weeks. Furthermore, reductions in tinnitus loudness 
correlated with TFI subscores regarding sense of control, intrusiveness, 
cognition, and sleep, suggesting that tinnitus loudness reduction during 
bimodal treatment conferred psychological benefits that outlasted 
the treatment.
Other approaches to treat tinnitus, such as the coordinated reset 
sound therapy or paired sound–vagal nerve stimulation also target 
putative aberrant neural activity but have not yet yielded positive 
results in the clinic. Paired vagal nerve stimulation, although showing 
promising results in an animal model, requires invasive surgery with 
accompanying risks and side effects, rendering it only suitable for 
the most debilitated patients. Sound therapies do not consistently 
reduce tinnitus loudness (56), perhaps because unimodal auditory 
stimulation has no effect on modulating long-term plasticity in the 
DCN (Fig. 3, B and C) (15, 18).
There are some limitations to our study. Our study only tested 
one subgroup of tinnitus patients, those with somatic tinnitus; thus, 
it is unknown whether these results would translate to other sub-
groups. In addition, ethical considerations prevented us from testing 
some protocol conditions in the human patients, such as the somato-
sensory stimulation–alone condition, which was observed to exac-
erbate tinnitus in the guinea pig study. Nevertheless, the neural de-
synchronization strategy presented here offers a new and accessible 
treatment possibility for tinnitus sufferers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
All animal procedures were performed per protocol established by the 
National Institutes of Health Publication No. 80-23 and approved 
by the University of Michigan’s University Committee on Use and 
Care of Animals. First, noise-over exposure was used to induce tinnitus 
in guinea pigs (see fig. S2). Evidence of tinnitus was provided by a 
behavioral test (GPIAS) and confirmed with physiological signatures 
of increased spontaneous rates of firing and synchrony in DCN fusi-
form cells. Twelve guinea pigs were used for physiological assessment 
after noise exposure, and 13 were used for physiological assessment 
after treatment. To the latter group (all expressing tinnitus), we applied 
noninvasive, 20 min/day auditory-somatosensory stimulation (with 
three different controls) for 25 days and assessed behavioral and neuro-
physiological correlates of tinnitus. Second (Fig. 5), a double-blinded, 
sham-controlled, crossover study was performed to evaluate the ef-
fectiveness of the auditory-somatosensory stimulation in humans 
with tinnitus. The study was performed in accordance with the Uni-
versity of Michigan Institutional Review Board. Participants were 
randomly assigned to either sham (n = 10) or active treatment first 
(n = 10) groups. Participants were trained to use a small, customized 
take- 
home device that provided the active and sham treatments. 
Weekly tinnitus spectra estimation and self-reported questionnaires 
were obtained on site. All 20 participants who completed the study 
were included in the analysis.
Tinnitus assessment in guinea pigs
Tinnitus was assessed using GPIAS (fig. S4A) (14, 15, 41, 57). A 
normalized startle ratio (NSR) was computed as the ratio of the 
mean startle amplitude for the gap/prepulse trials and the mean of 
the startle-only trials (fig. S4B). An animal was defined as having 
tinnitus in a frequency band if the postexposure mean NSR value 
for gap inhibition was significantly greater than the baseline value. 
Neural recordings to evaluate spontaneous activity and synchrony 
were performed after the completion of tinnitus assessments.
Human tinnitus assessment
A computerized procedure (TinnTester) (58) was used for weekly 
loudness matching in the laboratory throughout the trial. The TFI 
questionnaire was used to assess the impact of a subject’s tinnitus 
on their quality of life (24).
Auditory-somatosensory treatment in guinea pigs  
and humans
The somatosensory stimulation was provided by transcutaneous 
active electrodes positioned on the skin overlying either the trigeminal 
ganglion or the cervical spinal cord in the region of C2 (with the ground 
electrode adjacent). In humans, electrode location depended on which 
maneuvers induced the strongest change in tinnitus. In guinea pigs, 
C2 was used throughout. Auditory stimulation was personalized 
according to each subject’s tinnitus spectrum. In guinea pigs, 8 kHz 
(most prevalent tinnitus frequency) was used. For the active treatment, 
the auditory stimulus preceded the somatosensory stimulus by 5 ms.
Statistics
Two-tailed t test, 2 contingency tests, Pearson’s linear correlation, 
one-way and two-way ANOVAs were used to determine statistical 
differences ( = 0.05). Post hoc analyses for ANOVA were per-
formed using the Tukey-Kramer test where indicated. For statistical 
significance evaluation of guinea pig’s tinnitus behavioral versus 
neurophysiological results, patients’ loudness versus TFI, and loudness 
matching measures, GLMM or linear mixed-effect models were used.
