Abstract
Objective—Greater body mass index (BMI) and body fat are associated with vasomotor 
symptoms (VMS). Thus, weight loss may prevent VMS. We analyzed whether concurrent BMI or 
waist circumference and/or changes in weight or waist circumference predicted incident VMS and 
whether these relations differed by menopause stage or race/ethnicity.
Methods—Data from 10 follow-up visits for 1546 participants in the Study of Women's Health 
Across the Nation who reported no VMS at baseline were modeled for time to first symptomatic 
visit in relation to concurrent BMI and waist circumference and change in weight and waist 
circumference during early and late menopause using discrete survival analyses, adjusting for 
covariates.
Results—Greater concurrent BMI and waist circumference were significantly related to greater 
any and frequent (≥6 days in the last two weeks) incident VMS in early menopause and lower 
VMS risk in late menopause. Percentage weight change since baseline and since the prior visit 
were unrelated to incident any VMS in either menopause stage. Percentage weight change since 
baseline had a significant shallow U-shaped association with incident frequent VMS in early 
menopause (p=0.02), a shallow inverse U-shape in late menopause (p=0.02), and a significant 
interaction with menopause stage (p=0.004) but not with race/ethnicity. Recent weight change was 
unassociated with incident VMS in either menopause stage. Results were similar for waist change.

INTRODUCTION
Up to 80% of midlife women experience vasomotor symptoms (VMS, hot flashes and/or 
night sweats) during the menopause transition1-3. Early observations in postmenopausal 
women were that greater estrone production in peripheral fat from aromatization of 
androstenedione4-6 was associated with less symptom reporting. However, longitudinal and 
cross-sectional studies of women during the menopausal transition1, 7-9 have indicated that 
greater body mass index (BMI, weight in kg/[height in meters]2) is associated with greater 
reporting of VMS. In addition, increased percentage body fat and increases in body fat over 
time, measured by bioelectrical impedance, have also been associated with greater VMS 
reporting10, 11. These results were unexpected due to the older, prior observations cited 
above4-6 of greater weight being associated with less symptom reporting. This discrepancy 
may be explained by the hypothesis that in the earlier phases of the menopausal transition, 
higher BMI (and, as some have suggested, potentially its resulting greater heat insulation12) 
may predispose to increased VMS occurrence.
A better understanding of the impact of weight and weight change on VMS has important 
implications for women, if weight loss is a potential option to reduce VMS (which may have 
a long duration13), and for the health care system. VMS are one of the chief menopause-
related problems for which midlife women seek medical care14, 15. Further, women with 
untreated VMS tend to have higher health care use and higher direct costs for care16. 
Research has not provided a clear understanding of the relationship of weight and body 
composition to VMS reporting. One recent study of midlife women found no relation 
between hot flashes and change in BMI and weight over one to five years of follow-up17. 
However, this study included largely only African American and White women, instead of a 
more diverse sample, and had a relatively short follow-up period. A small six-month weight-
reduction trial found a reduction in self-reported hot flashes with weight loss but not in 
objectively measured hot flashes18. An additional report from the dietary intervention trial 
(reducing fat intake and increasing fruit, vegetables and whole grain intake and weight loss) 
of the Women's Health Initiative found that postmenopausal women with VMS at baseline 
who lost 10 or more pounds or 10% or more of their baseline body weight by one year were 
more likely to eliminate VMS compared with those who maintained weight, as were women 
assigned to the dietary intervention19. However, these analyses focused on postmenopausal 
women who reported VMS at baseline, rather than preventing their occurrence/incidence in 
peri- and postmenopausal women. It is possible that weight and weight gain may operate 
differently pre- and postmenopausally. Postmenopausal weight gain might result in more 
protection from VMS than premenopausal weight gain20 due to aromatization of

 testosterone producing relatively more estrogen in relatively estrogen-deficient 
postmenopausal women.
We undertook the present analyses to evaluate the following hypotheses: 1) greater 
concurrent BMI or waist circumference would be associated with greater incident VMS in 
pre- and early perimenopause (“early stage”) and less incident VMS in the late peri- and 
postmenopause (“late stage”); 2) in longitudinal analyses, increases in weight and waist 
circumference over time since baseline would be associated with greater incident reporting 
of VMS in the early stage and with less incident reporting of VMS in the late stage; 3) in 
longitudinal analyses, increases in weight and waist over time since the prior annual visit 
(recent increases) would be associated with greater incident VMS reporting; and 4) all of 
these relations would not differ by race/ethnicity.
METHODS
Study Participants
The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) is a seven-site, longitudinal 
cohort study of five racial/ethnic groups of women aged 42-52 years at enrollment in 
1995-1997 who were pre- or early peri-menopausal. SWAN's initial cross-sectional study 
screened women for eligibility for the longitudinal study. Eligibility for the cross-sectional 
study were: resident in the geographical area of one of the sites, age 40-55 years, self-
defined as one of the target racial/ethnic groups, and spoke English or one of the site-
specific languages (Japanese in Los Angeles, Spanish in New Jersey, or Cantonese in 
Oakland). Details of recruitment for SWAN have been described elsewhere21.
To be included in the longitudinal cohort, participants had to have had at least one menstrual 
period in the prior 3 months and not been using exogenous sex steroids. Of the 16,065 cross-
sectional participants, 6,521 were cohort-eligible, and 3,302 (50.6%) enrolled. Women were 
deactivated from the cohort only if they explicitly refused further contact. Those who had a 
hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or initiated menopausal hormone therapy (HT) 
during follow-up continued to be followed.
Of the original SWAN study participants recruited at baseline (N=3,302), data from 65 
women with a prevalent cancer diagnosis were omitted from all analyses – as this may have 
affected weight and/or VMS – as were data from 34 women who were missing information 
about baseline VMS or BMI. The remaining 3203 participants were included in cross-
sectional analyses of baseline VMS frequency, 353 of whom had VMS on 6 or more days in 
the past 2 weeks (frequent VMS), an indicator of increased severity of VMS. Among the 
1948 participants with no VMS at baseline, in longitudinal analyses of incident VMS, data 
from 102 women were omitted because at the first annual follow-up visit: 91 had initiated 
menopausal hormone therapy; 4 had incident cancer; 5 had a hysterectomy or bilateral 
oophorectomy; and 2 were pregnant or breastfeeding and reported VMS. Another 123 
participants with no follow-up VMS data were omitted, as were 177 participants who had 
missing covariate data. Thus, the total analytic sample was 1546 participants for longitudinal 
analyses of incident VMS related to concurrent BMI and waist circumference and change in 
weight and waist. Study participants were followed for ten annual visits after the baseline

 visit; 65.0% of the analytic sample (N=1005) provided follow-up visit 10 data on VMS, 
concurrent BMI, and concurrent menopause status, and 60.2% (N=930) also provided all 
covariate data at follow-up visit 10.
Procedures
Participants in SWAN were followed with annual in-person clinic visits that included: 
signed, written informed consent; a standard protocol for measuring height with a 
stadiometer, weight with a balance beam scale and waist circumference at the level of the 
natural waist or the narrowest part of the torso from the anterior aspect; fasting morning 
blood draw on days 2-5 of the menstrual cycle for menstruating women or any day for non-
menstruating women; and interviewer- and self-administered questionnaires, which 
contained questions on demographic characteristics, medical and reproductive history, 
medications, psychosocial measures, and symptoms. Common protocols were used at all 
sites. Trained, certified staff conducted the interviews with scripted questions and standard 
probes. The questionnaires were forward- and back-translated into Spanish, Cantonese, and 
Japanese and were administered by bilingual interviewers to women who preferred these 
languages. Institutional review boards at all sites approved the study protocols.
Outcome Variables
At each follow-up visit, participants were asked about a number of symptoms, including hot 
flashes and/or night sweats in the prior two weeks22-24. Prior analyses1 indicated that these 
two symptoms were highly correlated, thus providing justification for examination of them 
jointly. Any VMS was defined as reporting at least one day with hot flashes or night sweats 
within the previous two weeks, and frequent VMS was defined as having VMS on six or 
more days in the past two weeks1. For analyses of incident (newly reported) VMS, we 
excluded women who reported any VMS at baseline so as to examine relations of concurrent 
BMI and waist circumference and changes in weight and waist to newly-developing VMS 
during follow-up.
Independent Variables
The primary time-varying independent variables for incident VMS were concurrent BMI and 
percent change in weight since baseline, and concurrent waist circumference and percent 
change in waist circumference since baseline, for all visits in analyses, i.e., through the first 
visit at which VMS was reported or the last visit if no VMS was reported. Additional 
analyses substituted time-varying independent variables percent change in weight and waist 
circumference from the immediately prior – rather than baseline – visit, to assess the role of 
recent changes in weight and waist. BMI was computed as weight in kilograms/(height in 
meters)2 and categorized (<25, 25-29.9 and >=30). Waist circumference was assessed in 
quintiles. For analyses of change since baseline, percent change variables were categorized 
as: >5% loss, 1-5% loss, stable (<1% change), 1-5% gain, >5-≤10% gain, and >10% gain to 
allow for a non-linear association and to identify meaningful amounts of change with 
adequate numbers in each category of each variable. For analyses of change since the prior 
visit, because cell counts were small for the two highest categories of gain in weight or 
waist, these two categories were merged; results from sensitivity analyses keeping the two 
categories separate were consistent (data not shown).

 Covariates
Time-invariant candidate covariates, measured at baseline included variables previously 
shown to be related to VMS1: educational level (less than high school, high school, some 
college, college or post-baccalaureate degree); race/ethnicity (self-designated white, African 
American, Japanese, or Chinese); baseline anxiety score (as a binary variable, using a cutoff 
value of >4 or ≤425 for a summed score of numbers of days in the past two weeks (ranging 
from 0=no days to 4=every day) of reporting irritability or grouchiness, feeling tense or 
nervous, heart pounding or racing, and feeling fearful for no reason)22; baseline depressive 
symptom score (elevated was score ≥16 on a 20-item Center for Epidemiology Studies – 
Depression scale)26; history of premenstrual symptoms; symptom sensitivity at first follow-
up visit (using quartiles of a summed score of degree of awareness of loud noise, hot or cold, 
hunger, pain and things happening in one's body, with responses ranging from 1=not at all 
true to 5=extremely true)27; SWAN study site; passive smoke exposure (person hours/
week)28; and physical activity score ( a summary physical activity score for occupational, 
household and caregiving, sports and exercise, and daily routine activities)29, 30. In our final 
multivariable models only baseline age, site, race/ethnicity, education, baseline depressive 
symptoms, history of premenstrual symptoms and symptom sensitivity scores were retained; 
other variables did not meet the retention criteria of the backward elimination approach 
described below in the analytic approach.
Annually-measured time varying covariates included: menopause transition stage 
(premenopausal, indicating a menstrual period in the prior three months and no change in 
menstrual regularity in the prior year; early peri-menopausal, indicating menses in the prior 
three months and changes in regularity in the prior year; late peri-menopausal, indicating no 
menses in the prior three months but menses in the prior 11 months; and postmenopausal, 
indicating ≥12 months of amenorrhea; to maximize statistical power when examining 
possible effect modification by menopausal status, we combined pre- and early peri-
menopausal categories (“early stage”) and late peri- and postmenopausal categories (“late 
stage”)); smoking31, categorized as never, past, and current; number of very upsetting life 
events (0, 1, 2+); and social support32. Final multivariable models omitted social support due 
to lack of statistical significance.
Data Analyses
At baseline, three VMS groups – none, infrequent (1-5 days), and frequent (6+ days) – were 
compared regarding baseline characteristics using chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests. 
Analyses of incident VMS – conducted separately for any VMS and frequent VMS – 
included only women reporting no VMS in the prior two weeks at baseline. Time to first 
symptomatic visit was modeled using discrete survival analyses33 due to the approximately 
annual nature of data collection. For ease of interpretation, associations are expressed as 
estimated percent with incident VMS at the concurrent visit, holding other factors fixed at 
their sample means34, in addition to hazard ratios. A participant's data were censored at 
initiation of hormone therapy, at hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy (which hindered 
assessment of menstrual/menopausal status or hormone status, respectively), or at her last 
visit, and visits concurrent with pregnancy or breastfeeding were omitted. Missing values of

 time-varying variables were interpolated based on prior and subsequent values for gaps of 
1-2 visits, as in previous SWAN analyses35.
To assess hypothesis #1, we modeled incident VMS as a function of concurrent early (pre- 
and early perimenopause) versus late (late peri- and postmenopause) menopause stage, 
concurrent BMI or waist circumference, and tested the interaction between menopause stage 
and body composition indicator; parallel models were estimated substituting waist 
circumference for BMI. To address hypothesis #2 regarding long-term change in body 
composition, we expanded the model for hypothesis #1 to add within-woman percent change 
in weight since baseline and its interaction with concurrent menopause stage; parallel 
models were estimated adding percent change in waist circumference since baseline and its 
interaction with concurrent menopause stage. To address hypothesis #3, regarding recent 
change in body composition, we expanded the model for hypothesis #1 to add within-
woman percent change in weight since the prior visit (approximately one year earlier) and 
its interaction with concurrent menopause stage; parallel models were estimated adding 
percent change in waist circumference since the prior visit and its interaction with 
concurrent menopause stage. Results adjusting waist circumference for height were similar 
(data not shown). Relative model fit, comparing hypothesis #2 models and hypothesis #3 
models with hypothesis #1 models, was computed using the Akaike Information Criterion 
(AIC)36; values less than 1 indicated a better fit when change in body composition was 
included in the model; values greater than 1 indicated a better fit when change in body 
composition was not included, and a value of 1 indicated essentially the same fit. All fits 
were very close to 1. To address hypothesis #4, we included race/ethnicity and its 
interactions with concurrent and percent change in BMI or waist circumference as predictors 
in the above models.
In multivariable modeling, backward elimination (p<0.05 for retention) was employed to 
eliminate redundant or irrelevant predictors, forcing in the design variables of race/ethnicity 
and site as well as baseline age. Sensitivity analyses included: also censoring at the first visit 
with missing VMS; omitting participants from the New Jersey site, which had a several-year 
hiatus in data collection beginning with follow-up visit 06; and using a larger “stable” 
category (5% to ≤ 5% gain) for change in weight or waist. Results from all sensitivity 
analyses, except when noted, were similar to those presented here (data not shown). All 
analyses were conducted in SAS Version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Study Sample Characteristics
At baseline, 39.2% of participants reported any VMS, and 11.0% reported VMS for 6 or 
more days in the prior two weeks (frequent VMS). During follow-up visits, the proportion of 
women reporting any VMS ranged from 26.1% in the first year to a high of 51.1% in year 8, 
after which the proportion dropped to 48.8% by year 10; the corresponding figures for 
women reporting frequent VMS was 5.9% in the first year to 22.3% in year 8, after which 
the proportion dropped to 18.7% and 19.8% in years 9 and 10, respectively. At baseline, 
VMS were reported significantly more by women who were older, were African American 
or Hispanic, had less education, had a history of premenstrual symptoms, had higher waist

 circumference and BMI, were past or current smokers, were early perimenopausal, and had 
more passive smoke exposure, higher symptom sensitivity and anxiety scores, greater 
depressive symptoms, more upsetting life events and lower physical activity scores (Table 
1).
First, we examined patterns of change in weight. About 28% of women had > 5% weight 
gain, and 10% had > 5% weight loss from baseline to the last visit included in analyses of 
incident any VMS (the first visit at which they reported VMS or the last non-censored visit). 
Those who gained at least 5% ranged from 23.0% in women who were obese at baseline to 
28.6% in women with baseline BMI <25. Women who were currently obese were the most 
likely to have gained more than 10% since baseline, but the proportion with weight gain was 
fairly similar in other concurrent BMI categories, and the Spearman correlation was only 
0.15, suggesting low collinearity of concurrent BMI and weight change. The percentages of 
women who lost weight ranged from 23.6% in those who were overweight (BMI 25-29.9) to 
3% in women who were obese at baseline.
Association of Incident VMS with Concurrent BMI and Waist Circumference
Concurrent BMI
In unadjusted analyses, incidence of any VMS was positively related to concurrent BMI in 
the early stage (pre- and early peri-menopause, p<0.0001), while in the late stage (late peri- 
and postmenopause), obese women had a significantly lower incidence of any VMS 
(p=0.02); this effect modification by menopause stage was statistically significant 
(p<0.0001, Table 2, Model 1). Incident frequent VMS was also was significantly positively 
related to concurrent BMI during the early stage (p=0.0009). However, no association was 
observed in the late stage, and the interaction with menopause stage neared statistical 
significance (Table 3, Model 1). Adjustment for covariates resulted in little change in these 
associations (Table 2, Model 2 and Table 3, Model 2). However, the interactions with 
menopause stage were significant for any and frequent VMS (p<0.0001 and p=0.03, 
respectively). All of these relations were very similar when we examined baseline instead of 
concurrent BMI (data not shown).
Concurrent Waist Circumference
In unadjusted analyses, higher concurrent waist circumference was associated with higher 
incidence of any VMS in the early stage (p<0.0001) but was associated with the lowest 
incidence of any VMS in the late stage (p=0.02); the interaction with menopause stage was 
significant (p=0.0005, Table 2, Model 3). Similarly, incident frequent VMS also was 
positively associated with concurrent waist circumference in the early stage (p=0.0006), but 
no association was observed in the late stage; the interaction with menopause stage again 
was significant (p=0.008, Table 3, Model 3). Covariate adjustment produced similar 
associations of concurrent waist circumference and interaction with menopause stage for 
incident any VMS (Table 2, Model 4). However, for frequent VMS, the positive adjusted 
association in the early stage was smaller and no longer significant, and the negative 
association in the late stage was statistically significant (p=0.02); the interaction with 
menopausal stage remained significant (p=0.007, Table 3, Model 4).

 Association of Incident VMS with Changes in Weight and Waist 
Circumference
Percent Weight Change Since Baseline
Adjusting only for concurrent BMI, percent weight change since baseline was not 
significantly related to incidence of any VMS for either menopausal stage, nor was its 
interaction with menopause stage statistically significant (Table 4, Model 1a). In contrast, 
the association of percent weight change since baseline with incident frequent VMS (Table 
5, Model 1a) had a shallow U-shape in the early stage (p=0.02) and a shallow inverse U-
shape in the late stage (p=0.02), and the interaction with menopause stage was significant 
(p=0.004). Unadjusted associations of concurrent BMI (or baseline BMI, data not shown) 
with incidence of any VMS (Table 4, Model 1a) and with incident frequent VMS (Table 5, 
Model 1a) were similar after adjustment for percent weight change since baseline. 
Differences in model fit compared with including only concurrent BMI (Table 2, Model 1 
and Table 3, Model 1) were negligible for both any and frequent incident VMS, respectively, 
indicating essentially no improvement in predictive power with the addition of percent 
weight change.
Adjusting for covariates had little impact on associations between weight change since 
baseline and incidence of any VMS (Table 4, Model 1b). However, the association of 
percent weight change since baseline with incident frequent VMS in the early stage was 
somewhat reduced (p=0.07, Table 5, Model 1b). The association in the late stage remained 
an inverse U-shape that was significant (p=0.004) as was the interaction by menopause stage 
(p=0.004). Other associations were similar before and after adjustment.
We also examined whether percent weight change since baseline modified the relation of 
concurrent BMI to incident VMS within menopause stage. Unadjusted patterns of 
associations of concurrent BMI with incident VMS were generally similar across categories 
of weight change. An exception was incident any VMS in the early stage (Figure 1a), with a 
smaller BMI-related difference in incidence at visits with greater than 1% weight loss and a 
larger BMI-related difference in incidence at visits with stable weight (p=0.002 for 
interaction between concurrent BMI and percent weight change). For incident frequent VMS 
in the early stage (Figure 1b), this interaction was not statistically significant (p=0.70). In the 
late stage, we did not observe interaction of concurrent BMI with weight change for either 
incident any VMS or incident frequent VMS (Figures 2a [interaction p-value=0.053] and 2b 
[interaction p-value=0.09], respectively). Thus, within both the early and late stage, weight 
change since baseline was not significantly associated with any VMS, but the patterns of 
association differed significantly by menopause status for frequent VMS, and weight change 
generally did not modify the effect of concurrent BMI.
Percent Weight Change Since the Prior Visit
In analyses adjusting only for concurrent BMI (Table 4, Model 2a) or for all covariates 
(Table 4, Model 2b), percent weight change since the prior visit, approximately one year 
earlier, like weight change since baseline, was unrelated to incidence of any VMS in both 
the early and late stages, and the interaction with menopause stage was not significant. 
Gold et al.

 Incidence of frequent VMS was reduced with increasing percent weight gain since the prior 
visit only in the early stage (p=0.03, Table 5, Model 2b). In contrast to the corresponding 
association with percent weight change since baseline, this latter association was monotonic 
and negative, not U-shaped. Adjustment for covariates (Table 5, Model 2b) reduced the 
association of recent percent weight change with incident frequent VMS in the early stage, 
which still showed a monotonic reduction in VMS with increased weight gain but was no 
longer significant (p=0.08). Associations of concurrent BMI with incidence of any and of 
frequent VMS remained similar after adjustment for recent percent weight change (Table 4, 
Model 2b and Table 5, Model 2b, respectively). Moreover, adding recent percent weight 
change to the model with only concurrent BMI did not improve model fit for prediction of 
incident any or frequent VMS.
Percent Change in Waist Circumference Since Baseline
In analyses adjusting only for concurrent waist circumference, percent change in waist since 
baseline was not significantly related to incidence of any VMS (Table 4, Model 3a) or of 
frequent VMS (Table 5, Model 3a) in either the early or late menopause stages. Also, as for 
weight change, no obvious pattern or trend was observed, though the interaction with 
menopause stage was significant for frequent VMS (p=0.006). Adjusting for covariates, 
percent change in waist from baseline was unrelated to incident any VMS (Table 4, Model 
3b) in either menopausal stage but was significantly related to incident frequent VMS (Table 
5, Model 3b) in the late stage (p=0.04) with an inverse U-shaped pattern and a significant 
interaction with menopause stage (p=0.006). Relative model fit was close to 1 for both any 
and frequent VMS, indicating that, like with change in weight, the addition of percent 
change in waist since baseline added little predictive ability after accounting for concurrent 
waist circumference.
Percent Change in Waist Circumference Since the Prior Visit
In analyses adjusting only for concurrent waist circumference, percent change in waist since 
the prior visit was unrelated to incident any (Table 4, Model 4a) and frequent (Table 5, 
Model 4a) VMS in both the early and late menopause stages. Associations with concurrent 
waist circumference and model fit were similar to those without change in waist. Adjusting 
for covariates, the lack of association with change in waist since the prior visit remained, 
although if the wider stable category (5% loss to ≤5% gain) was used, the association was U-
shaped for any incident VMS in the late stage (p=0.04) with significant interaction with 
stage (p=0.04) (data not shown). However, the positive association of concurrent waist 
circumference with any VMS in the early stage was somewhat weakened (p=0.04) (Table 4, 
Model 4b) and for frequent VMS became non-significant (Table 5, Model 4b), but a stronger 
and statistically significant negative association was observed for concurrent waist 
circumference with incident frequent VMS in the late stage (p=0.01) with a significant 
interaction for menopause status (p=0.006). Inclusion of recent percent change in waist 
circumference yielded a negligible worsening of model fit in the adjusted analyses and thus 
did not improve prediction of incident VMS beyond that for concurrent waist circumference.

 Effect Modification by Race/Ethnicity
Only one interaction of race/ethnicity with concurrent weight or waist circumference or 
percent change in weight or waist was statistically significant in multivariate models (data 
not shown); given the large number of tests, this finding was likely to be spurious. The 
trends were similar, but because the numbers in some racial/ethnic subsets were fairly small, 
statistical significance was not observed.
DISCUSSION
The results of these longitudinal analyses have shown, first, that concurrent BMI and waist 
circumference, rather than the change in these measures, were most strongly related to 
incidence of VMS (Tables 4 and 5). That is, for a given concurrent BMI or waist 
circumference, a woman's incidence of VMS was essentially unaffected by whether her 
weight or waist circumference was stable or had changed in the long-term or short-term. 
Changes in weight and waist circumference essentially did not add predictive power to the 
models, nor did adjustment for change in these measures affect the associations of 
concurrent BMI or waist circumference with incidence of VMS. Women who gained the 
most or the least since baseline had a greater likelihood of incident frequent VMS in the 
early stage but less likelihood of incident frequent VMS in the late stage; these were the only 
instances for which we observed anything resembling a consistent pattern in adjusted models 
for incident VMS with changing weight or waist circumference. However, these associations 
may have been due to chance because we did not observe U-shaped associations for any 
VMS in either the early or late menopausal stage. These results may be due to the fact that 
most percent changes in weight and waist represented relatively small absolute changes and 
do not rule out that large absolute changes may be necessary to observe changes in risk of 
VMS.
The second important observation was that interactions with menopause status were 
statistically significant for all but one of the adjusted associations of any and frequent VMS 
with concurrent BMI and waist circumference (Tables 2 and 3), indicating that these effects 
differed in the early and late menopause stages. Concurrent BMI and waist circumference 
tended to be positively associated with VMS in the early stage and negatively associated in 
the late stage, although these trends were not always monotonic and not statistically 
significant for frequent VMS due to relatively small numbers of women in these categories. 
These interactions with menopause stage are consistent with early observations in 
postmenopausal women that greater estrone production in peripheral fat from aromatization 
of androstenedione4-6 was associated with less symptom reporting, while in the earlier 
phases of the menopause transition, higher BMI (potentially resulting greater heat 
insulation12) may predispose to increased VMS occurrence.
Our results are largely consistent with those of a recent study of midlife women showing that 
change in BMI and weight change over one to five years of follow-up were not related to 
reporting hot flashes17. However, our study went beyond this study by: including five racial/
ethnic groups, compared to only two in that study; having a much longer follow-up period;

 examining both changes in weight and waist circumference; and examining relations of 
recent and long-term change in weight and waist circumference to developing VMS.
Our findings, however, differ from those reported from the dietary intervention trial of the 
Women's Health Initiative (WHI), the Women's Health in Lund Area study (WHLA) and the 
Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH). The WHI results indicated 
that postmenopausal women with VMS at baseline who lost 10 or more pounds or 10% or 
more of their baseline body weight in one year were more likely to “eliminate” VMS 
compared with those who maintained weight19. The WHLA and ALSWH found that VMS 
were reported more by women who had gained weight but not significantly less in those who 
lost weight9, 37. Some of these inconsistencies may be due to methodological differences 
between studies. Notably, the WHI focused on reduced prevalent VMS in postmenopausal 
women who reported VMS at baseline, unlike the present analyses, which focused on 
incidence of VMS in women who did not have these symptoms at baseline and included 
women in the early and late menopausal transition stages. The WHLA was large but cross-
sectional and asked about weight gain over the past five years but did not report the time 
over which VMS were reported nor the racial/ethnic distribution37. The ALSWH was 
longitudinal over 15 years and asked about VMS in the last 12 months in a larger sample of 
women who were aged 45-50 years at baseline, but race/ethnicity was not reported9, while 
the present study examined VMS in the prior two weeks longitudinally over 10 years in 
association with recent and long-term weight change in women aged 42-52 years at baseline 
in five racial/ethnic groups. A prior paper on a subset of the SWAN cohort showed the same 
relation of concurrent weight to VMS by menopausal stage as observed in these analyses, 
but that paper had a smaller, less diverse sample in which postmenopausal women were 
relatively under-represented, and change in weight was not assessed20.
Our study had several strengths. First, we followed a large and diverse sample of midlife 
women from five racial/ethnic groups longitudinally for 10 years with nearly annual 
objective measures of weight and waist circumference, using the same protocol for all 
participants, thus reducing potential recall bias. Second, we used appropriate sophisticated 
analyses to accommodate the nature of the interval data and controlled confounding by 
multiple variables. These strengths provided adequate statistical power to detect meaningful 
associations, provided reasonable representativeness of midlife women which enhances the 
generalizability of the findings, used the same high quality measures for the independent and 
dependent variables (and covariates) for all participants and controlled potential 
confounding by a large and varied group of variables.
The study did, however, have some limitations. First, not all racial/ethnic groups were 
represented in our sample, somewhat compromising generalizability. Second, only a small 
percentage of women (<15%) lost weight or reduced their waist circumference or gained 
>10% (10%), making detection of meaningful associations of large weight changes with 
VMS somewhat more tenuous, particularly when examining racial/ethnic groups separately. 
Third, we made multiple statistical comparisons, so that some of the observed associations 
may have occurred by chance or represent other, uncontrolled factors; thus, caution must be 
used for interpreting marginally significant results and significant but modest associations. 
Fourth, VMS were not rare; so, if we had used odds ratios, they may have overestimated

 risk, but the use of percentage of women reporting VMS somewhat mitigated this concern. 
Fifth, because our study aims involved incident, rather than prevalent, VMS, those who had 
incident VMS in the early stage were omitted from analyses of the later stage and differed 
(fewer African American and overweight/obese women) from those who developed VMS in 
the late stage. Finally, differential loss to follow-up by BMI or waist circumference was 
possible, which could have affected our findings. However, while women who were heavier 
at baseline or at the prior visit were somewhat more likely to have missing data at the 
subsequent visit, the differences were small (9.3% of obese women had missing VMS data 
at the subsequent visit versus 6.0% of normal-weight women), so that the bias was likely to 
be small.
CONCLUSIONS
Concurrent BMI and waist circumference, rather than percentage changes in weight and 
waist, were significantly related to incident VMS during longitudinal follow-up. This 
suggests that maintenance of healthy weight in midlife women early in the menopausal 
transition may help to prevent VMS. However, it is important to note that we still lack a 
comprehensive understanding of the fundamental underlying physiologic mechanisms for 
VMS38, and findings have been inconsistent regarding the effects of weight gain or loss. 
Inconsistent findings may also reflect the menopausal status-by-weight interaction that we 
observed because most prior studies predominantly involved late-stage observations, and 
others may have had a mix without considering the interaction.
Additional research on the role and potential mechanisms of weight and waist 
circumference, which are modifiable risk factors, in incident VMS has the potential to 
inform appropriate preventive strategies and benefit many women who experience these 
prevalent and often bothersome and long-lasting VMS.

(a)Covariates included: Time-invariant - baseline age, race/ethnicity, site, V01 symptom sensitivity, baseline CES-D depression (yes/no), history of premenstrual symptoms, and 5-category educational level; Time-varying - smoking (never, past, current), number very upsetting 
life events (0, 1, 2+)
(b)Early stage includes pre- and early perimenopausal
(c)Late stage includes late peri- and postmenopausal
(d)Values below 1 indicate superior fit, above 1 indicate worse fit
(e)Percentages for concurrent BMI computed at observed distribution for % change in weight, and percentages for % change in weight computed at observed distribution for concurrent BMI
