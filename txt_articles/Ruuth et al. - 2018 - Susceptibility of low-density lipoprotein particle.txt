Aims
Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles cause atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) through their reten-
tion, modification, and accumulation within the arterial intima. High plasma concentrations of LDL drive this dis-
ease, but LDL quality may also contribute. Here, we focused on the intrinsic propensity of LDL to aggregate upon
modification. We examined whether inter-individual differences in this quality are linked with LDL lipid compos-
ition and coronary artery disease (CAD) death, and basic mechanisms for plaque growth and destabilization.

Methods
and results
We developed a novel, reproducible method to assess the susceptibility of LDL particles to aggregate during lipoly-
sis induced ex vivo by human recombinant secretory sphingomyelinase. Among patients with an established CAD,
we found that the presence of aggregation-prone LDL was predictive of future cardiovascular deaths, independent-
ly of conventional risk factors. Aggregation-prone LDL contained more sphingolipids and less phosphatidylcholines
than did aggregation-resistant LDL. Three interventions in animal models to rationally alter LDL composition low-
ered its susceptibility to aggregate and slowed atherosclerosis. Similar compositional changes induced in humans by
PCSK9 inhibition or healthy diet also lowered LDL aggregation susceptibility. Aggregated LDL in vitro activated mac-
rophages and T cells, two key cell types involved in plaque progression and rupture.

Conclusion
Our results identify the susceptibility of LDL to aggregate as a novel measurable and modifiable factor in the pro-
gression of human ASCVD.

Introduction
An elevated plasma concentration of low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol (LDL-C) is a primary causal factor in the development of ath-
erosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)1 and significantly
contributes to the total cardiovascular risk.2 However, even after effi-
cient LDL-C-lowering, a substantial residual risk for ASCVD events
remains.3–5Atherosclerosis arises from subendothelial retention, or
trapping, of LDL within the arterial intima, and several steps are
required for plasma LDL-C to provoke normal arteries to become
diseased. The retained lipoproteins become modified by arterial-wall
enzymes and oxidants,6,7 tend to aggregate,8 and aggregated
lipoprotein-derived particles are found both in human and in experi-
mentally induced atherosclerotic lesions in animal models.9–12 The in-
timal processes triggering aggregation of LDL particles have been
proposed to include lipid peroxidation and proteolytic and lipolytic
digestion of LDL by local enzymes, such as the mast cell chymase hav-
ing chymotrypsin-like activity,13 the group V secretory phospholipase
A2 (PLA2),14 which is produced by macrophages, as well as the secre-
tory sphingomyelinase (SMase), which is released by macrophages
and endothelial cells.15 Aggregation enhances the binding of lipopro-
teins to the arterial extracellular matrix,8 and their large size makes
egress back across the endothelium nearly impossible.7 Moreover,
aggregated LDL induces the formation of foam cells, a hallmark of
lesions at all stages of atherogenesis.14,16,17 Indeed, the development
of an atherosclerotic lesion involves a series of maladaptive
responses of innate and adaptive immune cells to the retained, modi-
fied, and aggregated lipoprotein-derived material.18,19
In this study, we focused on the intrinsic susceptibility of circulating
LDL particles to aggregate upon modification, and, for the first time,
examined inter-individual differences in this quality. This study aimed
to determine whether the degree of aggregation susceptibility of LDL
can predict future cardiovascular deaths and whether it can be modi-
fied by nutritional or medical treatment.
Materials and methods
Human plasma
Human blood plasma samples were obtained from healthy volunteers
(Finnish Red Cross Blood Service, Helsinki, Finland), 100 samples derived
from subjects participating in the Health 2000 Health Examination
Survey,20 48 samples from Corogene survey,21 57 samples from SYSDIET
(Systems biology in controlled dietary interventions and cohort studies)
survey, 29 samples from the 18-week diet group and 28 samples from the
24-week diet group,22, 23 and 40 samples from the EQUATOR study.24
The use of human material conformed to the principles outlined in the
Declaration of Helsinki, and the studies were approved by the local ethics
committees.
Written

participants.
Isolation of LDL and lipid and lipoprotein
measurements
Lipid measurements
Fasting plasma total cholesterol and triglycerides were enzymatically
measured (Roche Diagnostics, GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). ApoB-100
content was measured with ELISA-kit (MABTECH, Nacka, Sweden).
LDL isolation
LDL (d = 1.019 to 1.063 g/mL) was isolated from plasma by KBr-based se-
quential ultracentrifugation.25 LDL concentrations are expressed as their
protein concentrations, which were determined by the BCA protein
assay (Pierce, Rockford, USA) using bovine serum albumin as a standard,
or as apoB-100 concentration determined by ELISA.
Translational perspective
Accumulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-derived cholesterol in the arterial wall causes atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
(ASCVD). High plasma concentrations of LDL drive this disease, but LDL quality may also contribute. Here, inter-individual differences in LDL
lipidome were found to determine the susceptibility of LDL to aggregate during lipolysis by human recombinant secretory sphingomyelinase.
The presence of aggregation-prone LDL in plasma predicted future cardiovascular death in coronary artery disease patients. Interventions in
pre-clinical models to rationally alter LDL composition lowered its susceptibility to aggregate and slowed atherosclerosis development. Our
results identify the susceptibility of LDL to aggregate as a novel measurable and modifiable factor in the progression of human ASCVD.

Measurement of LDL aggregation
Development of a method to quantify person-to-person variability in
LDL aggregation-susceptibility is available in Supplementary material on-
line, Methods and Figures S1–S3. In the assay we developed, LDL isolated
from human plasma was extensively dialysed against 20mM MES buffer,
pH 5.5, containing 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, and 50mM
ZnCl2. The sample was diluted with the same buffer to give a final con-
centration of 0.2 mg of apoB-100/mL, then human recombinant secretory
sphingomyelinase (hrSMase) was added to to give a final enzyme concen-
tration of 75mg/mL, and the mixture was incubated at þ37�C. The size of
LDL was determined immediately and the hourly up to 6 h. An aliquot
was taken at the same time points for phosphorylcholine measurement.
The degree of sphingomyelins (SM) hydrolysis was determined by meas-
uring the phosphorylcholine content from the samples with Amplex Red
reagent (Invitrogen).
SM- PC-, and LPC-enrichment of LDL ex vivo
LDL was enriched ex vivo with SM, PC, or LPC using phospholipid
vesicles, as described in detail in Supplementary material online,
Methods.
Mice
Large ‘empty’ vesicle-treated mice
Human APOB100 transgenic, Ldlr-/--mice on a chow diet, with food and
water received ad libitum (13–19weeks old for control with phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) and 19weeks old for large ‘empty’ vesicle (LEV),
weight 30–33g) (n = 16 per group) were injected once with PBS or with
LEVs (also known as large unilamellar vesicles, 100-nm in diameter, dosed
at 1000mg PC/kg body weight). One hour after PBS or LEVs injection,
plasma was collected, and the d < 1.063g/mL KBr fraction was isolated
using ultracentrifugation. Because LEVs can appear in the LDL density
range, we collected the supernatant fraction after ultracentrifugation,
loaded it onto a Superose 6 HR column (size-exclusion FPLC), and eluted
with 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4. LDL fractions, which came out
after the peak for LEVs and VLDL, were pooled and re-loaded onto the
Superose 6 HR column, eluted with 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 7.4,
at which point no peak for LEVs or VLDL was detectable. LDL fractions
were pooled in pairs (sample size, n = 16) and protein concentration was
measured. The animal procedures were approved by the Animal Ethical
Committee at the Gothenburg University.
Myriocin-treated mice
Male Ldlr-/-, Apob100/100 mice on the C57BL/6J genetic background were
obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and housed in
the National Laboratory Animal Center of the University of Eastern
Finland. Mice were divided into control (n = 11) and myriocin (n = 11)
groups. The mice were fed on an high-fat atherogenic diet (21% milk fat,
0.2% cholesterol; Harlan Teklad; TD88137; colloquially called the
‘Western’ diet) from 14 to 22weeks of age onwards, with food and water
received ad libitum. Myriocin (0.3mg/kg) (Biomol Research Laboratories
Inc.) or PBS as control was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) three times per
week for 10weeks. After 10weeks on high-fat diet with myriocin/PBS
treatment, mice were fasted for 4 h and terminal anaesthetised with iso-
flurane inhalation (Vetflurane 1000mg/g, Virbab animal health). Blood
was collected by heart puncture. These animal procedures were
approved by the National Animal Experiment Board of Finland and car-
ried out in accordance with the guidelines of The Finnish Act on Animal
Experimentation.
Soat2-/-mice
Human APOB100 transgenic, Ldlr-/-, Soat2-/-, and human APOB100 transgen-
ic, Ldlr-/- expressing sterol O-acyltransferase 2 (SOAT2) mice were fed
on a diet rich in cis-monounsaturated fat26 for 8 months, after which
plasma was collected and LDL particles were isolated by ultracentrifuga-
tion. These animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee at Wake Forest University Health Sciences.
Assessment of atherosclerotic lesions
The degree of atherosclerosis was assessed by Sudan IV staining of the
aortas as described in Supplementary material online.
Lipid mass spectrometry analyses
LDL lipids were analysed by mass spectrometry as described in
Supplementary material online.
Circular dichroism analyses
The secondary structure of apoB-100 in LDL particles was determined
by circular dichroism as described previously27 and in Supplementary ma-
terial online.

Results
Measurement of the susceptibility of LDL
to aggregate ex vivo
We developed a novel, reproducible method to quantify donor-to-
donor variation in the susceptibility of LDL particles to aggregate (see
Supplementary material online, Methods and Figures S1–S3). LDL was iso-
lated from plasma samples by ultracentrifugation, aggregation of each
LDL preparation was induced ex vivo by incubation with hrSMase, and
the kinetics of aggregation were followed in real time by measuring the
growth of the aggregates by dynamic light scattering (Figure 1A). Other
agents to modify LDL ex vivo produced far smaller aggregates with negli-
gible discrimination between individuals (see Supplementary material on-
line, Figure S1a–e). In the absence of any modifying agent, LDL particles
show no sign of aggregation (Supplementary material online, Methods).
We used our hrSMase-based assay to screen LDL aggregation sus-
ceptibility in samples derived from the Finnish Health 2000 Health
Examination Survey,20 which comprised largely healthy individuals
(n= 100, Table 1, Figure 1B). To quantify the inter-individual variation
in the aggregation susceptibility of LDL, we first developed a
population-based generalized mixed-effect model (see Supplementary
material online, Figure S3a). As described in the Supplementary mater-
ial online, Methods, these data revealed that the inflection points in the
curves of aggregate size vs. incubation time readily distinguished the
aggregation susceptibility of the different LDL samples. Further, we
found that LDL aggregate size at the 2-h time point correlated tightly
and significantly with the inflection point (see Supplementary material

online, Figure S3b, rho = -0.961, P < 0.001). Importantly, the extent of
aggregation at 2h clearly identified subjects having extremely
aggregation-prone LDL particles (Figure 1C, Quartile 1). Therefore, in
further assays, aggregate size at this time point was used as a measure
of LDL aggregation susceptibility.
The susceptibility of LDL to aggregate
predicts future cardiovascular deaths
We next measured the aggregation susceptibility of LDL isolated
from plasma samples derived from patients with clinically diagnosed
coronary artery disease (CAD). The samples were from a nested
case–control study28 that had been designed using samples from the
Finnish Corogene study.21 The cases in that study included all patients
who had experienced coronary death within an average follow-up of
2.5 years. Control patients were selected from the group who had
no cardiovascular events during the follow-up period (Stable CAD
group), and they were pairwise matched based on conventional
CAD risk factors, statin use, and coronary stenosis index. The plasma
samples selected for this study (n = 48) were from non-diabetic
males, all of whom had >
_50% coronary stenosis (Table 2).
We again observed substantial inter-individual differences in the ag-
gregation susceptibility of the isolated LDL particles. Importantly, in the
CAD Death group, LDL particles aggregated significantly faster than in
the Stable CAD group, the median sizes of the aggregates after incuba-
tion for 2h being 1500nm (range 150–3200nm) and 940nm (range
90–1990nm), respectively (Figure 1D). Moreover, the 2-h aggregate
sizes of LDL samples in both CAD groups were significantly higher
than in the 100 LDL samples obtained from the Health 2000 study; me-
dian 200nm (range 60–2000nm) (Figure 1D). LDL aggregation at 2h
was not associated with the initial sizes of LDL particles, nor did it asso-
ciate significantly with plasma concentrations of LDL-C, apoB-100, C-
reactive protein (hsCRP), or lipoprotein (a), nor with statin use, age or
smoking, but showed a negative correlation with plasma triglyceride
levels (see Supplementary material online, Tables S1 and S2).

Figure 1 Measurement of the susceptibility of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from healthy human subjects and from coronary artery disease
patients to aggregate ex vivo. (A) LDL is isolated from blood plasma by ultracentrifugation and aggregation was induced by incubation with human re-
combinant secretory sphingomyelinase (hrSMase) at pH 5.5. The size of LDL particles was measured before hrSMase treatment (time = 0 h), and for-
mation of LDL aggregates was followed in real time by measuring their size with dynamic light scattering. (B) LDL particles were isolated from 100
plasma samples collected from the Finnish Health 2000 Health Examination Survey and the aggregation susceptibility of the particles was analysed.
Based on LDL aggregate size at 2 h, the particles were divided into quartiles. (C) Size distributions of LDL aggregates at the 2 h time point. The box
encompasses the middle 50% of the measured values; the horizontal line within each box shows the median of the measured values; the whiskers en-
compass the most extreme data point that is still no further from the margins of the box than 1.5 times the interquartile range. (D) Patients (n = 48)
from the Corogene study, having >50% stenosis in their coronary arteries were divided into two groups: (i) CAD death group, in which patients died
of coronary events during an average 2.5-year follow-up period and (ii) stable CAD group, having no cardiovascular events during the follow-up
period. The patients were matched for the conventional cardiovascular risk factors. LDL was isolated and LDL aggregation was induced by treatment
with hrSMase. The box plot diagram shows the distribution of aggregate sizes after incubation for 2 h in the two groups from Corogene study and in

The susceptibility of LDL particles to
aggregate strongly associates with the
particle lipid composition
The surface monolayer of LDL particles comprises phospholipids, free
cholesterol, ceramides (Cer), and a single copy of apoB-100 as the
principal structural apolipoprotein of the particle (Figure 2A).
Phosphatidylcholines (PC) are the major phospholipid class, followed
by sphingomyelins (SM), and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC). The sur-
face also contains small amounts of other classes of phospholipids and
ceramides. The particle core contains mainly cholesteryl esters (CE)
and triacylglycerols (TAG). The compositions of isolated LDL prepara-
tions from the Health 2000 and Corogene studies described above
were determined by quantitative mass spectrometry-based lipidomics.
Volcano plots show the significant (P< 0.05) correlations between
LDL aggregation and the molar percentages of specific lipids of the
LDL surface (Figure 2B, C) and core (Figure 3A, B). Several sphingolipids
(SMs and various forms of Cer) correlated positively (red) and various
phosphatidylcholine (PC) species correlated negatively (blue) with
LDL aggregation. Regarding the core lipids of LDL, the degree of LDL
aggregation correlated negatively particularly with several 48–52 car-
bon TAGs in both cohorts (Figure 3A, B). Of note, of the lipids that sig-
nificantly associate with LDL aggregation, the ceramides and TAG 50:4
differed significantly between the Stable CAD and CAD Death groups,
ceramides being higher and TAG 50:4 lower in the case group.
Direct enrichment LDL with different
phospholipids changes aggregation
susceptibility of LDL and conformation of
apoB-100
To determine causal effects of lipid composition on LDL aggregation,
we next isolated LDL from four healthy volunteers and enriched the
LDL with SM 18:1/16:0, PC 16:0/18:1, or LPC 16:0. Changes in the
relative proportions of phospholipids in these lipid-enriched LDL
particles were small (see Supplementary material online, Figure S4a)
and the final compositions were well within ranges we observed in
other human LDL samples. Although the aggregability of control LDL
from the four donors varied considerably (see Supplementary mater-
ial online, Figure S4b, black lines), in each case the LDL preparations
enriched with SM became more susceptible to aggregation during in-
cubation with hrSMase, while LDL preparations enriched with PC or
LPC became less susceptible. We know from previous studies that
SMase-treatment of LDL induces conformational changes in apoB-
100 that expose otherwise hidden segments of apoB-100 that medi-
ate particle aggregation.27 Here, we show that enrichment of LDL
with SM enhanced SMase-induced conformational changes in apoB-
100 (see Supplementary material online, Figure S4c, d).
In human subjects, decreases in LDL-SM
by dietary change, or by PCSK9 inhib-
ition decreased LDL aggregation
susceptibility
To determine if a change in LDL lipid composition changes the aggre-
gation susceptibility of LDL, we analysed samples from two different
interventions: (i) SYSDIET, a dietary intervention, in which healthy
volunteers with features of the metabolic syndrome were randomly
assigned to either a Healthy Nordic diet (n = 33) or to a Control diet
(n = 24) for 18 or 24 weeks22, 23 and (ii) EQUATOR, a randomised
placebo-controlled phase II trial of a fully human monoclonal anti-
body RG7652 that inhibits the function of proprotein convertase
subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9, n = 25; placebo, n = 15). Fasting plasma
samples were obtained at baseline and 29 days after treatment.24
First, we analysed the aggregation of LDL from plasma samples
that had been collected from the Finnish participants in the SYSDIET
study. Supplementary material online, Table S3 shows the clinical
characteristics of these subjects at baseline and the end of the study,
and Supplementary material online, Figure S5a shows the changes in

the macro- and micro-nutrient compositions of what each subject
consumed based on food diaries at the beginning and at the end of
the study.22, 23 In the Healthy Nordic diet group, LDL aggregation
decreased in two-thirds of the participants, whereas in the control
group, only small changes in LDL aggregation were observed (Figure
4A, B). To estimate how much of the changes in LDL aggregation
could be attributed to the dietary changes, we constructed a multi-
variate model using data from the subjects in the Healthy Nordic diet
group. The best model included just two components from the food
diaries: changes in dietary vitamin E and changes in dietary sucrose
(Table 3). Decreased aggregation susceptibility was associated with
increased dietary vitamin E and decreased dietary sucrose consump-
tion. An increase in dietary vitamin E is considered a useful marker of
increased consumption of vegetable oils rich in polyunsaturated fatty
acids, and both were significantly associated with increased propor-
tion of PCs and decreased proportion of SMs in plasma LDL particles
(see Supplementary Figure S5b). These lipidomics changes were also
associated with reduced LDL aggregation susceptibility in the Healthy
Nordic diet group (Figure 4C and Supplementary material online,
Figure S5b), but no significant associations were observed in the con-
trol group (see Supplementary material online, Figure S6a).
Inhibition of PCSK9 is known to strikingly lower LDL-C, and we re-
cently showed that PCSK9 inhibition also influences plasma and
lipoprotein phospholipid composition.29 The clinical characteristics of
EQUATOR trial subjects at baseline and the end of the study are
descripted in Supplementary material online, Table 4. In the treatment
group of the EQUATOR trial, LDL aggregation susceptibility
decreased in two-thirds of the subjects, whereas in the placebo group,
only small changes in LDL aggregation occurred during the trial (Figure
4D, E). In addition, the overall change in aggregation susceptibility be-
tween the groups was significantly different between the two treat-
ment groups (P = 0.035). The decrease in LDL aggregation in the
treatment group correlated with an increase in several PC species and
a decrease in several SM species (Figure 4F). In the control group, only
PC 16:0/18:2 correlated significantly with decreased LDL aggregation
susceptibility (see Supplementary material online, Figure S6b).
Pharmacological and genetic
interventions in vivo to render LDL
resistant to aggregation
To further examine our model linking changes in LDL lipids with
changes in the susceptibility of LDL to aggregate, we carried out three
interventions that had previously been shown to induce changes in
LDL lipid composition and to decrease atherosclerosis in hypercholes-
terolaemic animals, but, remarkably, without changing the plasma

concentrations of LDL-C.30–32 In the first intervention, we adminis-
tered a single intravenous bolus injection of large 100-nm ‘empty’
vesicles (LEVs, also known as large unilamellar vesicles) composed of a
single lipid, PC 16:0/18:1, into human APOB100 transgenic/Ldlr-/- mice
(n= 16) fed on a regular chow diet. Control APOB100 transgenic/Ldlr-/-
littermates (n= 16) received an intravenous injection of an equivalent
volume of PBS. Plasma was collected 1 h after the injection, and LDL
was purified sequentially by ultracentrifugation and size-exclusion
chromatography. Treatment with LEVs substantially altered LDL lipid
composition in vivo (see Supplementary material online, Figure S7) and
rendered LDL nearly completely resistant to aggregation ex vivo, even
after 24h of incubation with hrSMase (Figure 5A and inset).
In the second intervention, we suppressed SM biosynthesis in
Ldlr-/-/Apob100/100-mice using myriocin, an inhibitor of serine-
palmitoyl transferase, the rate-limiting enzyme in SM biosynthesis.
Inhibition of this enzyme in mice leads to the generation of SM-
depleted lipoprotein particles.31 After 10 weeks of a high-fat athero-
genic diet combined with three intraperitoneal injections/week of
myriocin or PBS (n = 11 per group), the animals were sacrificed.
Treatment with myriocin did not change plasma cholesterol or trigly-
ceride levels, but LDL particles from the myriocin-injected mice con-
tained a far lower proportion of SM (see Supplementary material
online, Figure S8) and were less susceptible to hrSMase-induced ag-
gregation than LDL from PBS-injected control littermates (Figure 5B).
In addition, atherosclerotic lesion areas were smaller in myriocin-
treated mice than in control mice, particularly in the region of the ab-
dominal aorta (Figure 5C).
In the third intervention, we investigated the effect of the compos-
ition of the lipid core of LDL particles on their susceptibility to aggre-
gate by using mice deficient in SOAT2, and enzyme also known as
acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase-2 or ACAT2. LDL was isolated
from the plasma of APOB100 transgenic/Ldlr-/-/Soat2-/- mice (n = 5)
and APOB100 transgenic/Ldlr-/-/Soat2þ/þ littermates (n = 3). LDL par-
ticles from SOAT2-deficient mice are characterized by enrichment in
polyunsaturated CEs and TAGs, when compared with LDL from
control mice.26 Here, we found that LDL particles from Soat2-/- mice
were particularly aggregation-resistant (Figure 5D), consistent with
our data from human LDL (Figure 3).
Aggregated LDL induces MMP-7 secre-
tion from macrophage foam cells and
activates T
-cells in vitro
To study maladaptive cellular responses relevant to atherosclerosis,
we examined the effects of hrSMase-aggregated LDL vs. native LDL
on cultured human primary monocyte-derived macrophages and
murine T-cell hybridomas that had been raised against oxidized
LDL.33 Aggregated LDL induced accumulation of cholesteryl ester-
rich lipid droplets in the human primary monocyte-derived macro-
phages (Figure 6A, B), consistent with prior literature.16 We also
analysed the concentrations of several matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs) in the culture media and found that foam cells induced with
hrSMase-treated LDL, but not with acetylated LDL, secrete increased
amounts of MMP-7 (Figure 6C), a protease considered to be an

Figure 4 A dietary intervention and PCSK9 inhibition in human subjects improves their low-density lipoprotein (LDL) composition and renders
their particles less susceptible to aggregate. Plasma samples were obtained from the SYSDIET-study, where participants were placed on either an iso-
caloric healthy Nordic diet (n = 33) or a control diet (n = 25) for 18 or 24 weeks and from the EQUATOR study, a randomized placebo-controlled
phase II trial of a monoclonal antibody inhibiting the function of PCSK9, RG7652, (n = 25), or placebo (n = 15) for 29 days. LDL was isolated, and ag-
gregation analysed from samples before and after the diet/treatment period. (A and B) LDL aggregate sizes at the 2-h time point are shown in the diet
group and control group before and after the diet period. Each line represents one subject and blue lines show a decrease and red lines an increase in
aggregate size. (D and E) LDL aggregate sizes at the 2-h time point are shown in the PSCK9 inhibitor group and placebo group before and after the
treatment period. Each line represents one subject and blue lines show a decrease and red lines an increase in aggregate size. (C and F) Volcano plot

important contributor to weakening, and ensuing rupture of athero-
sclerotic plaques.34
In parallel with macrophages, T cells are also recruited to athero-
sclerotic lesions. Triggered by LDL that is taken up and presented by
antigen-presenting cells, T cells can accelerate atherosclerosis in
hypercholesterolaemic animals and promote features associated
with plaque instability.18 Paradoxically, T-cell hybridomas raised
against oxidized LDL do not react to oxidized LDL.33 Nonetheless,
T cells with a similar set of clonotypic T-cell receptors in hypercho-
lesterolaemic mice have been shown to participate in the growth of
their atherosclerotic plaques.18 Here, we found that the degree of
LDL aggregation induced by SMase associated positively with the de-
gree of T-cell activation, as measured by the secretion of interleukin-
2 (Figure 6D, left panel). In contrast, consistent with earlier data,33 oxi-
dized LDL inhibited the T-cell response (Figure 6D, right panel).
Discussion
In this study, we show that the susceptibility of LDL particles to ag-
gregate in the presence of hrSMase varies significantly amongst
human subjects and depends on the lipid composition of their LDL
particles. The presence of aggregation-prone LDL was associated
with future CAD deaths independently of conventional CAD risk fac-
tors including plasma LDL-C concentration, smoking, and hyperten-
sion. Importantly, we show that the susceptibility of LDL particles to
aggregate can be favourably modified in humans by nutritional and

Figure 5 Pharmacological and genetic interventions that favourably alter low-density lipoprotein (LDL) lipid composition in vivo in hypercholester-
olaemic mice render their LDL aggregation-resistant. (A) Human APOB transgenic/LDLr�/� mice were given a single intravenous injection of large
‘empty’ vesicles (LEVs) made from PC 16:0/18:1 or equivalent volume of PBS (control, n= 8 per group). After 1 h, plasma was collected, LDL isolated,
and aggregation induced by treatment with hrSMase. LDL aggregation was followed by dynamic light scattering at the indicated time points. The insert
shows LDL aggregation for up to 24 h. (B) LDLr�/�/Apob100/100 mice were simultaneously started on an atherogenic western-type diet and intraperi-
toneal injections three times per week of either myriocin, and inhibitor of SM biosynthesis, or PBS (n = 11 mice per group). Diet and injections contin-
ued for 10 weeks. LDL was isolated, then treated with hrSMase, and particle aggregation was followed by dynamic light scattering at the indicated
time points. (C) Representative aortas from a control mouse and a myriocin-treated mouse stained with Sudan IV. The extent of atherosclerosis was
determined by measuring the amounts of Sudan IV positive areas in the aortas. (D) LDL was isolated from the plasma of human APOB transgenic/

medical interventions and in vivo in animals by altering LDL lipid
composition.
Aggregated LDL has been suggested to promote atherogenesis by
inducing lipid accumulation in the arterial wall both extra- and intra-
cellularly.8, 16, 35 A major trigger for aggregation of LDL particles
within the arterial wall is their digestion by the secretory SMase,15
and genetic deletion of this enzyme in hypercholesterolaemic animals
dramatically retards atherosclerotic plaque development.36 The im-
portance of SMase in human atherogenesis is reflected by the obser-
vation that large LDL aggregates isolated from human atherosclerotic
lesions are enriched in ceramides, the lipolytic products of SMase ac-
tion.15 Aggregated lipoprotein particles accumulating in human ath-
erosclerotic lesions also show signs of other modifications, such as
proteolysis, lipolysis of both the core and the surface lipids, and oxi-
dation.12 Interestingly, studies in vitro have shown that these modifica-
tions promote sphingomyelinase-induced LDL modification.13, 15
In this study, we extend these earlier findings and show that
foam cells generated by incubating macrophages in the presence
of SMase-aggregated LDL secreted MMP-7, a proteinase with a
potential role in the rupture of human atherosclerotic plaques.37
Moreover, we show that LDL aggregated by SMase can trigger a
potent T-cell response against apoB-100. This maladaptive
immunological mechanism may accelerate the progression of ath-
erosclerosis and the development of plaque instability.38 In fact,
SMase-induced modification and aggregation of LDL represents
the first pathophysiologically plausible modification of LDL ex vivo
that enhances the ability of LDL to activate T-cell hybridomas
linked with atherosclerosis.
The present data indicate that aggregation-prone human LDL par-
ticles are enriched in SM and ceramides, and that they contain less
choline phospholipids (PC and LPC) and TAGs than aggregation-
resistant LDL particles. Causality of these lipids in LDL aggregation
susceptibility was established by altering their contents in isolated
LDL in vitro, in humans by diet and by PCSK9 inhibition, and in three
atherosclerotic mouse models in vivo. Thus, increase in vitamin E con-
sumption was associated with decreased LDL aggregation, and, when
the aggregation data were normalized for changes in the consump-
tion of vitamin E, increased intake of sucrose was found to associate
with accelerated aggregation. Interestingly, plasma levels of SM have
been strongly influenced by genetic effects.39 Such influence could
partly explain our observation that the aggregation susceptibility
decreased in only two-thirds of the subjects in the healthy diet group.
Similarly, inhibition of PCSK9 decreased LDL aggregation in two-
thirds of the subjects.

SM-rich LDL from apoE-/- mice has previously been shown to be
prone to the formation of large aggregates.15, 40, 41 Here, we used
three atherosclerotic mouse models, in which we modified the com-
position of LDL particles in vivo. We demonstrate here that an in-
crease in LDL-PC by intravenous injection of PC-containing LEVs, a
pharmacologically induced decrease in LDL-SM with myriocin, an in-
hibitor of SM biosynthesis, and a genetically induced increase in poly-
unsaturated CEs and TAGs in LDL, each decreased the susceptibility
of LDL particles to aggregate. Importantly, each of these treatments
has been shown to reduce atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolaemic
animals, notably without influencing plasma concentrations of choles-
terol.26, 30–32, 42
In most studies examining the relationship between lipid markers
and ASCVD risk, the lipid composition of whole plasma, rather than
that of circulating LDL particles, has been determined. In such studies,
high levels of plasma SM43 and low levels of certain LPC-species44
were associated with increased risk for future development of clinically
significant ASCVD. In addition, plasma levels of certain ceramide spe-
cies have recently been found to predict future risk of cardiovascular
death in patients with ASCVD.28 These results from whole plasma re-
flect the lipid composition of all plasma lipoprotein classes. Therefore,
our present findings demonstrating that aggregation-prone LDL par-
ticles are SM-rich, ceramide-rich, PC-poor, and LPC-poor may explain
the previously reported associations between the plasma levels of
these lipids and future ASCVD risk. Moreover, our work supports a
mechanistic chain from these compositional differences to differences
in LDL quality that predispose it to SMase-induced aggregation, to pla-
que initiation, progression and, destabilization (Take home figure).
In summary, aggregation-prone LDL was found to predict death
from cardiovascular causes independent of conventional atheroscler-
osis risk factors. Importantly, prior and current data indicate that
aggregated LDL has the potential to promote multiple steps along
Take home figure Development of a measurement of LDL aggregation susceptibility revealed the importance of qualitative differences in LDL
particles in ASCVD. The circulating LDL particles of patients succumbing in CAD have a high proportion of sphingomyelins (SM) and ceramides.
When such aggregation-prone LDL particles enter the arterial intima, they easily aggregate upon modification. Intimal LDL aggregates promote
atherogenesis, inflammation and plaque rupture by inducing foam cell formation, secretion of matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) and by activating
T-cells, ultimately increasing the risk for fatal CAD. Therefore, decreasing the aggregation susceptibility of circulating LDL could reduce CAD risk. In
vitro and in mouse models, aggregation-prone LDL particles can be rendered aggregation-resistant by reducing their sphingolipid content. In humans,
a healthy diet or treatment with a PCSK9 inhibitor improves the quality of LDL particles resulting in aggregation-resistant phosphatidylcholine (PC)-
and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-rich LDL particles.

the atherogenic pathway from LDL retention to maladaptive
responses that include initiation and growth of atherosclerotic
lesions, plaque destabilization, and plaque rupture. Any treatment
that induces a favourable change in LDL lipid composition offers a
means to attenuate LDL aggregation within the arterial wall and its
deleterious consequences. These results emphasize the importance
of LDL quality in human ASCVD. Moreover, measurement of the
susceptibility of LDL to aggregate may serve as a predictive biomark-
er for the identification of patients at significant residual or unrecog-
nized risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and who might
benefit from personalised, targeted interventions.
