Each year, an estimated 14,000 women aged ≤40 years 
are diagnosed with breast cancer, which remains the 
leading cause of cancer-related death in this patient 
population.1 Several studies have shown that breast 
cancer has more aggressive biological characteristics in 
women aged <40 years compared with older women,2,3 
including higher likelihood of high-grade, estrogen re-
ceptor–negative tumors, and lymph node (LN)–posi-
tive disease,4–6 However, due to a higher proportion 
of HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer 
(TNBC) in this group, these women are also more likely

Abstract
Purpose: We sought to evaluate whether pathologic nodal response was predictive of outcomes in women aged ≤40 years with breast 
cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Methods: A total of 220 patients treated with NAC between 1991 and 2015 were 
retrospectively reviewed. Pathologic complete response (pCR) was defined as no evidence of residual invasive tumor in the breast and 
lymph nodes (LNs) (ypT0/Tis ypN0); partial response if there was no tumor in the LNs but residual tumor in the breast (ypT+ ypN0) or residual 
tumor in the LNs (ypT0/Tis ypN+); and limited response if there was residual tumor in both the breast and the LNs (ypT+ ypN+). Kaplan-
Meier and Cox proportional hazards analyses were performed to identify factors predictive for overall survival (OS). Results: A total of 
155 patients were included. Following NAC, 39 patients (25.2%) achieved pCR, 57 (36.8%) achieved a partial response (either ypT+ ypN0 
or ypT0/Tis ypN+), and 59 (38.1%) had a limited response. A total of 22 patients (14.2%) experienced local failure, 20 (12.9%) experienced 
regional failure, and 59 (38.1%) experienced distant failure. Median OS for patients who achieved pCR was not reached, and was signifi-
cantly worse for patients who had residual disease in the breast and/or LNs (P<.001). No difference in OS was seen among patients who 
had residual disease in the breast alone versus those who remained LN-positive (97 vs 83 months, respectively; P=.25). Subset analysis did 
not reveal differences in OS based on year of treatment or cN1 disease at the time of initial diagnosis. Conclusions: Women aged ≤40 years 
who achieved pCR had excellent outcomes; however, those who achieved a pathologic response in the LNs but had residual disease in the 
breast continued to have outcomes similar to those who remained LN-positive.

neoadjuvant setting, however its prognostic potential 
has not been investigated in women aged ≤40 years. 
The current debate centers on whether women who 
attain either pCR or ypN0 after NAC should receive 
adjuvant radiation treatment in the form of region-
al nodal irradiation or postmastectomy radiation, or 
whether this can be omitted. In a pooled analysis of 
NSABP B-18 and B-27,13 attaining pathologic nod-
al response emerged as a strong predictor of DFS and 
OS. Another analysis of these 2 studies by Mamou-
nas et al10 showed that younger patients who achieve 
ypN0 have a higher 10-year probability of locore-
gional recurrence (LRR) compared with women aged 
>60 years; the exact risk for LRR in women aged <40 
years was not presented. In addition, pathologic nodal 
status and breast tumor response were predictive of 
LRR and suggested that, due to low rates of LRR in 
favorable subgroups, adjuvant regional nodal irradia-
tion and postmastectomy radiation could possibly be 
omitted. This forms the basis of the rationale for the 
ongoing NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 trial (ClinicalTri-
als.gov identifier: NCT01872975). 
Our study evaluated pathologic nodal response in 
women aged ≤40 years treated with NAC for breast 
cancer, and hypothesized that it would be associated 
with DFS and OS in this patient population. 
Methods
We conducted an Institutional Review Board–ap-
proved, retrospective, single-institution analysis 
of women diagnosed with breast cancer at age ≤40 
years and treated between 1991 and 2015. A total 
of 155 patients were identified, 40 and 115 of whom 
were diagnosed and treated between 1991–2004 and 
2005–2015, respectively. All patients received NAC 
and surgery with or without radiation therapy (RT). 
Pathologic confirmation of axillary nodal involve-
ment by fine-needle aspiration was not required for 
inclusion in our analysis. Patients were excluded if 
surgical or RT records were not available at the time 
of data analysis, if they had metastatic disease at di-
agnosis, or if they received chemotherapy for other 
cancer diagnoses. pCR was defined as no evidence of 
residual invasive tumor in the breast and sampled ax-
illary LNs (ypT0/Tis ypN0). All other patients were 
considered to have partial response if there was no 
tumor in the LNs but residual tumor in the breast 
(ypT+ ypN0) or no tumor in the breast but residual 
tumor in the LNs (ypT0/Tis ypN+). Those who had 
residual tumor in both the breast and LNs were clas-
sified as having a limited response (ypT+ ypN+). Re-
sidual cancer burden was not routinely assessed in all 
pathology samples, and therefore was not included 
in this analysis.
All patients included in this study had detailed 
clinical and pathologic information available for re-
view, such as clinical stage at diagnosis, hormone 
receptor (HR) status, HER2 status, Ki67 percent-
age, BRCA1/2 mutation status, type of NAC, use of 
HER2-targeted therapy and hormonal therapy, size 
of residual disease, LN involvement, presence of 
lymphovascular invasion, and achievement of pCR. 
Local (LF), regional (RF), and distant (DF) failure 
were recorded for each patient. 
All statistical analysis was conducted using SAS 
version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.). Competing risks 
analysis was performed using the Fine-Gray method 
to analyze cumulative incidence of LF, RF, and DF for 
each site; hazard ratios were reported with a 95% CI, 
and OS was calculated using Kaplan-Meier and log-
rank tests. Multivariable analysis was performed with 
Cox proportional hazards regression using select prog-
nostic parameters identified as significant on compet-
ing risks analysis. Statistical significance was deter-
mined as a 2-sided P value <.05.
Results
A total of 155 patients were included in this analysis. 
Median age was 36 years (range, 20–40 years), and 
median follow-up time was 52 months (range, 6–293 
months). The median OS for the entire cohort was 
122 months. Table 1 details the clinical character-
istics. In brief, 97 patients (62.5% of the entire co-
hort) had genetic test results available for BRCA, 
of which 25.8% (n=25) carried BRCA1 mutations 
and 7.2% (n=7) carried BRCA2 mutations. Initial 
clinical stage at diagnosis was stage I in 4%, stage II 
in 45%, and stage III in 46%. All patients received 
NAC followed by mastectomy (n=108; 69.7%) or 
lumpectomy (n=47; 30.3%). A total of 132 (85.2%) 
patients received adjuvant RT; 42 of 47 (89.4%) af-
ter lumpectomy (5 refused) and 90 of 108 (83.3%) 
after mastectomy. 
After NAC, 39 patients (25.2%) achieved pCR 
(ypT0/Tis ypN0), 52 (33.5%) achieved ypT+ ypN0, 
and 5 (3.2%) achieved ypT0/Tis ypN+. The remain-

(17.0%) who underwent lumpectomy, and DF oc-
curred in 46 of 108 of patients (43.6%) who under-
went mastectomy and 13 of 47 (27.6%) who under-
went lumpectomy. No local or regional recurrences 
occurred in patients who achieved pCR. A total of 
3 patients (7.7%) with pCR developed distant me-
tastases, 2 of whom were still alive with disease at 
time of writing, and 1 who died 96 months after the 
initial diagnosis. However, patients with residual 
disease in either the breast or LNs had a higher in-
cidence of LF, RF, and DF than those who achieved 
pCR (Figure 1), with approximately 50% experi-
encing DF at 10 years (P<.001; Table 2). Of those 
who achieved a pCR in the LNs, patients who still 
had residual disease in the breast did not have bet-
ter outcomes compared with those who remained 
LN-positive. Cumulative incidence of LF, RF, and 
DF at 10 years by response to NAC is depicted in 
Table 2, with corresponding cumulative incidence 
curves in Figure 1. Median OS for patients with 
pCR was not reached (P<.001). No significant dif-
ference in OS was seen between ypT+ ypN0 ver-
sus ypN+ patients, with median OS of 97 versus 83 
months, respectively (P=.25) (Figure 2A). 
To evaluate whether modern systemic thera-
py affected OS, we stratified patients into 2 groups 
based on treatment date and chose a cutoff of 2005, 
because this was when the use of trastuzumab for 
HER2-positive breast cancer had become standard 
of care. On Kaplan-Meier analysis, no difference in 
OS was seen among patients treated between 1991–
2004 and 2005–2015 (median OS, 122 months vs 
not reached, respectively; P=.88). We next analyzed 
patients treated between 2005–2015 (n=116) sepa-
rately to evaluate outcomes in a patient population 
with routine HER2 testing and regular use of trastu-
zumab. Patients with ypT+ ypN0 and ypN+ disease 
continued to have worse OS compared with those 
who achieved pCR, with median OS not reached 
for the pCR group, and 84 versus 77 months, re-
spectively, for patients with ypT+ ypN0 and ypN+ 
disease (P<.001; Figure 2B). We also evaluated out-
comes of patients with an initial diagnosis of clinical 
 
T1–3N1 breast cancer (n=115) who achieved pCR 
in the LNs (ypT0/Tis ypN0 and ypT+ ypN0) follow-
ing NAC, because this group is included in the on-
going NSABP B-51 trial. We found that outcomes 
of patients who achieved pCR were excellent, with 
median OS not reached (P=.03; Figure 2C); how-

5 patients achieved ypT0/Tis ypN+, the cohort was 
subsequently grouped into 3 subsets: patients who

ever, patients with ypT+ ypN0 disease did not have 
improved OS compared with those who remained 
ypN+ after NAC, with a median OS of 84 versus 
107 months, respectively. On multivariable analy-
sis, mastectomy (P=.009), adjuvant RT (P=.045), 
achievement of pCR (P<.001), and total LNs sam-
pled (P=.011) were all predictive of OS (Table 3).
Lastly, we investigated the impact of breast 
cancer subtype on outcomes. Patients were divided 
into 4 groups: HR-positive/HER2-negative (n=60; 
39.2%), HR-positive/HER2-positive (n=21; 13.7%), 
HR-negative/HER2-positive (n=17; 11.1%), and 
TNBC (n=55; 35.9%); subtype was not available for 
2 patients. pCR by breast cancer subtype was 18.3% 
for HR-positive/HER2-negative, 23.8% for HR- 
positive/HER2-positive, 35.3% for HR-negative/
HER2-positive, and 31% for TNBC. Median OS was 
not reached for the HR-positive/HER2-positive and 
TNBC cohorts, was 170 months in the HR-positive/
HER2-negative cohort, and was 96 months in the 
HR-negative/HER2-positive cohort (P=.03). OS by 
subtype and pCR is shown in supplemental eFigure 1 
(available with this article at JNCCN.org). 
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating 
outcomes by pathologic nodal response in women 
aged ≤40 years treated with NAC. We focused on 
young women treated with NAC because this popu-
lation is infrequently studied on its own, yet has 
worse survival compared with older women despite 
higher rates of pCR. In addition, although the sec-
ondary analysis of NSABP B-18 and B-2710 has been 
used to guide risk assessment following NAC, it does 
not include a comprehensive analysis of recurrence 
risk in women aged ≤40 years. Our report presents 
LF, RF, and DF rates in this high-risk breast cancer 
population, making this analysis unique with respect 
to the published literature.
Our analysis reveals that women aged ≤40 years 
with residual disease in the breast or LNs have in-
creased LRR rates compared with those who achieve 
pCR in both the breast and LNs. Perhaps the most 
compelling finding of our analysis is that women 
with residual disease in the breast, despite having a 
pCR in the LNs, had similar LRR rates as those with 
residual nodal disease. This important finding sug-
gests that omitting RT in patients with any residual 
disease after NAC, whether in the breast alone or 
in the breast and LNs, should be considered with 
caution. The LRR rates remained between 15% and 
22% in patients with ypT+ ypN0 and ypN+ disease, 
even though most patients in our study received

breast alone or in the breast and the LNs, is a pre-
dictor of poor prognosis in this patient population. 
In contrast, no patient who achieved pCR follow-
ing NAC experienced LRR, and the incidence of DF 
was low. These results corroborate other published 
series showing pCR to be the strongest predictor 
of outcome after NAC.10,14 Whether patients who 
achieve a pCR will have low rates of LRR without 
postmastectomy or nodal irradiation is an area of on-
going investigation. 
A large percentage of our cohort (38.1%) expe-
rienced DF, driven in large part by women who did 
not achieve pCR following NAC. This high rate of 
DF is also likely due to most of these women (≈90%) 
having stage II–III disease at diagnosis, making our 
patient population particularly high risk. A retro-
spective analysis of 170 women aged ≤40 years treat-
ed with NAC also observed a high rate of recurrence 
(29.4%) and mortality (22.9%).15 It is likely that 
these women would benefit from adjuvant treatment 
to improve outcomes, and several trials have evalu-
ated escalation of adjuvant therapy.16–18 The recently 
published CREATE-X trial19 evaluated 910 patients 
with HER2-negative breast cancer who had residual 
invasive disease or LN metastases after NAC. Wom-
en were randomized to either adjuvant capecitabine 
or observation. At 5 years of follow-up, the addition 
of adjuvant capecitabine significantly prolonged DFS 
and OS. Other efforts to improve outcomes center 
around increasing rates of pCR through the escala-
tion of NAC regimens.20,21 In the 5-year follow-up 
of the NeoSphere trial,22 the addition of pertuzumab 
to trastuzumab + docetaxel improved long-term out-
comes in women with HER2-positive breast cancer. 
This led to the accelerated FDA approval of pertu-
zumab in the neoadjuvant setting.23 
Our analysis shows that young women with 
breast cancer who achieve a pCR in both the breast 
and the LNs experience improved outcomes, where-
as those who have residual disease in the breast, de-

spite having a pCR in the LNs, do not have better 
outcomes compared with those who remain LN- 
positive after NAC. The strengths of this study in-
clude a detailed assessment of pathologic response 
and patterns of failure, as well as stratification of 
patients based on the time frame during which they 
received treatment (1991–2004 vs 2005–2015), 
clinical stage at diagnosis, and breast cancer sub-
type. Our analysis differs from previously reported 
studies because it assesses LRR, as well as DF and 
OS for all patients included in the analysis. Limita-
tions of our study include its retrospective nature 
and relatively small sample size. As a single-insti-
tution study, our results may not be generalizable to 
the population at large, but are hypothesis-generat-
ing nonetheless. 
Conclusions  
Our analysis demonstrates that outcomes in young 
women aged ≤40 years receiving NAC vary by 
pathologic response in the breast and the LNs. Young 
women who achieve pCR have excellent outcomes; 
however, those who achieve pCR in the LNs but 
have residual disease in the breast continue to have 
outcomes similar to those who remain LN-positive. 
Our data suggest that de-escalation of care in this 
patient population should be approached with cau-
tion until the results of NSABP B-51 are available.
