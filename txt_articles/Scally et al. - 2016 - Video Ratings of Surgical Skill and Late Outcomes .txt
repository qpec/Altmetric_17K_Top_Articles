IMPORTANCE Measures of surgeons’skills have been associated with variations in short-term
outcomes after laparoscopic gastric bypass. However, the effect of surgical skill on long-term
outcomes after bariatric surgery is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To study the association between surgical skill and long-term outcomes of
bariatric surgery.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this retrospective observational study, 20 surgeons
performing bariatric surgery submitted videos; surgeons were ranked on their skill level
through blinded peer video review and sorted into quartiles of skill. Outcomes of bariatric
surgery were then examined at the patient level across skill levels. The patients (N = 3631)
undergoing surgery with these surgeons had 1-year postoperative follow-up data available
between 2006 and 2012. The study was conducted using the Michigan Bariatric Surgery
Collaborative, a prospective clinical registry of 40 hospitals performing bariatric surgery in
the state of Michigan.
EXPOSURE Surgeon skill level.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Excess body weight loss at 1 year; resolution of medical
comorbidities (hypertension, sleep apnea, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia), functional status,
and patient satisfaction.
RESULTS Surgeons in the top and bottom quartiles had each been practicing for a mean of
11 years. Peer ratings of surgical skill varied from 2.6 to 4.8 on a 5-point scale. There was no
difference between the best (top 25%) and worst (bottom 25%) performance quartiles
when comparing excess body weight loss (67.2% vs 68.5%; P = .86) at 1 year. There were no
differences in resolution of sleep apnea (62.6% vs 62.0%; P = .77), hypertension (47.1% vs
45.4%; P = .73), or hyperlipidemia (52.3% vs 63.4%; P = .45). Surgeons with the lowest skill
rating had patients with higher rates of diabetes resolution (78.8%) when compared with the
high-skill group (72.8%) (P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In contrast to its effect on early complications, surgical skill
did not affect postoperative weight loss or resolution of medical comorbidities at 1 year after
laparoscopic gastric bypass. These findings suggest that long-term outcomes after bariatric
surgery may be less dependent on a surgeon’
s operative skill and instead be driven by other
factors. Operative technique was not assessed in this analysis and should be considered in
future studies.

A
fter a decade of focus on optimizing perioperative care,
there has been a paradigm shift toward optimizing the
quality of the operation itself. Until recently, surgical
quality improvement has largely focused on improving sys-
tems of care, such as improving compliance with periopera-
tive checklists or adherence to evidence-based guidelines for
antibiotic administration.1-3 Efforts to improve perioperative
care have contributed to significant gains in patient safety but
have failed to provide insight on the effect of the surgeon on
the operation itself. Studies from the surgical education litera-
turehavedemonstratedthatitispossibletodirectlyassesssur-
gical skill with high levels of reliability and reproducibility.4-6
Recently,theseratingsofsurgicalskillwereshowntobestrongly
associated with variation in postoperative outcomes.7
However, understanding how surgical skill relates to out-
comes is in its nascent stages. While existing research has
shown a link between surgeon skill level and short-term out-
comes(eg,30-daycomplicationrates),7toourknowledge,there
havebeennodataevaluatingthelinkbetweenlonger-termout-
comes and surgeon performance. Long-term outcomes are im-
portant to consider in a number of operations, particularly af-
ter bariatric surgery when weight loss and comorbidity
resolution occur typically beyond the first month after sur-
gery. There are multiple ways that long-term outcomes could
be affected by surgical skill. For example, short-term out-
comes (eg, complications) could mediate suboptimal longer-
term outcomes. For instance, a postoperative complication,
such as a leak or a stricture, that resulted from an intraopera-
tive technical error may result in a prolonged hospitalization
and slow recovery. In turn, this may result in a patient’
s lim-
ited ability to participate in postoperative nutritional coun-
seling and exercise programs long-term. To our knowledge,
there are no studies to date that evaluate the association
between surgeon skill and these late operative outcomes. In
addition, the current metrics of skill level have largely been
validated in the educational realm and used to rate novices
such as surgical residents. These current skill measures may
have limitations in their applicability, which merit further
investigation.
In this context, we conducted a study evaluating the as-
sociation between surgeon skill and late surgical outcomes. To
do this, we focused on laparoscopic Roux-en-y gastric bypass
(LRYGB) because these patients have high rates of postopera-
tive follow-up and multiple quantitative metrics on which to
measure their late outcomes of surgery. We used existing sur-
gical skill ratings of 20 practicing bariatric surgeons in the state
of Michigan, as judged anonymously by their peers who evalu-
ated the video of a typical case using a validated instrument.
We then assessed the association between these skill ratings
and long-term outcomes of bypass surgery, chiefly weight loss
and resolution of medical comorbidities.
Methods
Data Source and Study Population
This study used data collected from the Michigan Bariatric Sur-
gery Collaborative (MBSC), a prospectively collected clinical
registry that includes 40 hospitals performing bariatric sur-
gery within the state of Michigan.8,9 The collaborative col-
lects data for both primary and revisional bariatric surgery that
includes approximately 6000 patients annually.
The MBSC registry includes basic patient demographics
and comorbidities, short-term outcomes, and 30-day compli-
cation rates; it additionally captures long-term weight loss and
health status. All variable definitions are standardized across
the 40 centers, and data collection is conducted by centrally
trained data abstractors.10 The registry also has a high degree
of intrahospital communication and collaboration, with quar-
terly meetings between surgeons and data abstractors. Each
hospital is visited annually and audited to ensure accurate and
complete data collection.
Our patient population included all patients who under-
went primary LRYGB by 1 of the 20 surgeons who partici-
pated in the video surgical skills study. Patient data were
obtained from cases that occurred between 2006 (the start
of the MBSC registry) and 2012 (when the video skill ratings
were performed), for which 1-year patient follow-up data
were available.
This study was approved by the University of Michigan in-
stitutional review board. Oral consent was obtained from the
participating surgeons. All patients included in the Michigan
BariatricSurgeryCollaborativeprovidewrittenconsentforpar-
ticipation in ongoing research projects through the collabora-
tive, which includes video recording.
Participating Surgeons and Rating of Surgical Skill
In a previous study within our research group, 20 surgeons

ticipation was entirely voluntary. Each surgeon submitted a
video of himself or herself performing a laparoscopic gastric
bypass. Surgeons were instructed to submit a representative
case (ie, a “typical” case, but the choice of what video to sub-
mit was left to the individuals); all patient identifiers were re-
moved from these videos.

Key Points
Question What effect does a bariatric surgeon’
s skill level have
on long-term patient outcomes?
Findings In this observational study of nearly 4000 patients
undergoing bariatric surgery, there was no linkage between the
skill level of the practicing surgeon performing the operation
and long-term patient outcomes such as weight loss or resolution
of diabetes.
Meaning While great attention has been paid to the association
between surgeons’skills and their postoperative outcomes, not all
outcomes appear to be directly associated with skill, at least as it is
currently measured.

and the rating instrument used was a modified version of the
Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS).
The OSATS instrument is the most commonly used for assess-
ing surgical skill and has been externally validated, demon-
strating construct and content validity for use in surgical train-
ees and practicing bariatric surgeons.4-6 Specifically for
laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery, the procedure used in this
analysis, the OSATS has been demonstrated to show wide vari-
ability among practicing bariatric surgeons. Moreover, the
OSATS ratings were strongly linked to short-term outcomes,
once again demonstrating construct validity.
Surgeons were rated using a 1-to-5 anchored Likert-type
scale on overall skill and then on the 5 OSATS domains of skill:
(1) ease of tissue handling, (2) tissue exposure, (3) instrument
handling, (4) efficiency of time and motion, and (5) flow of the
operation. Anchors were used, with a skill rating of 1 indicat-
ing the level of a general surgery chief resident; 3, that of an
average bariatric surgeon; and 5, a master surgeon. No train-
ing was given to the peer raters and no attempt was made to
establish rating norms.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome of interest was excess body weight loss
(EBWL) at 1 year after the operation. Secondary outcome mea-
sures were resolution of medical comorbidities at 1 year (dia-
betes, sleep apnea, hypertension, and hypercholesterol-
emia). We also assessed overall health and function using the
Health and Activity Limitation Index (HALEX),11 which has
been validated for use in evaluating the quality of life in pa-
tients with obesity,12 and patient satisfaction.
Statistical Analysis
In our conceptual model, skill measured at the surgeon level
served as the exposure variable against which each outcome
measure was assessed. Because each surgeon treated mul-
tiple patients, all analyses were adjusted for surgeon-level
clustering.
As a measure of surgeon skill, the average peer rating
across all 6 metrics of the rating instrument was used (the
global rating and the 5 specific domains). The ratings across
these domains correlated very closely with one another (cor-
relation coefficients, 0.85-0.97). This close correlation was
the rationale for using a simple average, as discussed in our
prior work.7 Surgeons were categorized into 3 groups, sorted
by quartiles of skill level (the bottom group representing the
lowest quartile; the middle group, the second and third
quartiles; and the top group, the fourth quartile). Outcome
measures were assessed across these 3 groups using multi-
variate logistic regression models for each of our outcome
measures. These models were risk adjusted for age, male
sex, previous venous thromboembolism, mobility limita-
tions, coronary artery disease, and pulmonary disease; the
methods and justification for this risk adjustment have been
described by our group in previous works.13 A post hoc
power calculation demonstrated that our analysis had
greater than 99% power to detect a 5% difference for all out-
comes metrics (α = .05, 2-sided). All analyses were con-
ducted in SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Surgeon Skill Ratings and Patient
and Surgeon Characteristics
As previously described by our group, aggregate skill ratings
for the 20 surgeons ranged from 2.6 to 4.8.7 The surgeons
within the lowest skill quartile had mean skill ratings of 2.9;
the highest quartile had mean ratings of 4.4 by comparison.
The 5 individual domains of surgical skill correlated closely to
the global rating; therefore, we used an overall average of all
6 ratings for the skill measures.
Surgeons’skill level did not correlate with years in prac-
tice, fellowship completion, or practice location (ie, teaching
vsnonteachinghospital).Surgeonsinthetopandbottomquar-
tiles had each been practicing for a mean of 11 years (P = .44);
20% of surgeons in each of the top and bottom quartiles, re-
spectively, had completed fellowship training in minimally in-
vasive or bariatric surgery (P = .56). We found that surgical skill
level was positively associated with annual procedural vol-
ume. Our group previously reported additional details on the
demographics of the surgeons themselves.7
The total patient cohort included 3631 patients for whom
follow-up data at 1 year for body weight, HALEX survey, and
patient satisfaction were available. Table 1 demonstrates the
characteristics of these patients across the quartiles of surgi-
cal skill. Overall, the cohorts were similar in age, sex, insur-
ance status, and preoperative body mass index (calculated as
weightinkilogramsdividedbyheightinmeterssquared).There
were several differences in patient comorbidities that were sta-
tistically significant (eg, cardiovascular disease and musculo-
skeletal disease). However, there was no clear association be-
tween these differences and the surgeon skill levels, and they
are likely attributable to the large sample size rather than clini-
cal significance.
Excess Body Weight Loss
Body weight at 1 year was available for 3631 patients under-
going LRYGB among the 20 participating surgeons. There were
nosignificantdifferencesinEBWLat1yearbetweenthegroups
of surgical skill. Figure 1 shows the EBWL subdivided by quar-
tile of surgeon skill. Patients undergoing operations by sur-
geons in the top quartile of skill had a 67.2% EBWL compared
with 68.5% in the bottom quartile (P = .86). Average preop-
erative body mass index was similar for each quartile as seen
in Table 1.
Resolution of Medical Comorbidities
One-year follow-up data were available for 1041 patients with
diabetes. The preoperative incidence of diabetes was similar
across quartiles of surgical skill. Of these patients, 72.8% in the
highest skill quartile had resolution of diabetes (as defined by
cessation of oral medication and/or insulin therapy) com-
pared with 78.8% in the lowest skill quartile (P = .01). For pa-
tientswithhypertension,follow-updatawereavailablefor1618
patients. A total of 47.1% of patients in the highest skill quar-
tile had resolution of hypertension compared with 45.4% in

apnea, there was no association between skill and resolution
of sleep apnea (62.6% vs 62.0%; P = .77) and similarly for the
1106 patients with hyperlipidemia, no association was seen
(52.3% vs 63.4%; P = .45). Figure 2 shows the relative rate of
comorbidity resolution across surgical skill levels.
For each comorbidity, the number of patients is smaller
compared with our overall patient cohort because the inci-
dence rate of each comorbidity varies. In addition 1-year fol-
low-up data were not available for all comorbidity measures
in some patients.

0.1 (most dysfunctional) to 1.0 (healthiest state). Among the
3631 patients who completed the HALEX survey at 1 year, no
association between surgeon skill and patient quality of life
was seen, as patients in the lowest skill quartile had a mean
HALEX score of 0.83 compared with 0.84 in the highest skill
group (P = .57) (Table 2).
Whenpatientswereaskedhowsatisfiedtheywerewiththeir
surgeon and surgery at 1 year, we did observe a positive asso-
ciation between surgeon skill and patient satisfaction. A total
of90.3%ofpatientsinthehighestskillquartilerespondedwith
“verysatisfied”at1yearcomparedwith87.1%inthelowestskill
quartile(P = .05).However,whilethissmalldifferenceachieved
statistical significance, it likely lacks clinical significance as all
quartiles had high overall satisfaction. Table 2 summarizes all
outcome measures according to surgeon skill level.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the asso-
ciation between operative skill and long-term outcomes after
surgery among practicing surgeons. Across multiple patient-
level measures, we found no association between levels of sur-
gical skill and long-term outcomes after laparoscopic gastric
bypass. At 1 year, there was no difference in EBWL when com-
paring patients who underwent surgery by a surgeon with a
lowerskillratingandpatientswhounderwentsurgerybyasur-
geon with a higher skill rating. Patients also experienced reso-
lution of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia at simi-
larratesclinically,regardlessofsurgeonskill.Finally,therewere
nodifferencesinpatient-reportedqualityoflifeassociatedwith
surgical skill ratings. These findings are somewhat counter-
intuitive because there is a well-known association between
other proxies of surgical skill (eg, surgeon volume) and most
measured outcomes. In our present study, our higher skilled
surgeons were, on average, higher volume but we found no as-
sociation between OSATS peer ratings, a more direct measure
of surgical skill, and long-term outcomes.
Prior studies that examined surgical skill were targeted
mainly to novices and trainees and had no means of deter-
mining the long-term effect of their skill on outcomes.4,14
For bariatric surgery, variation in long-term outcomes have
largely been assessed by comparing numerous patient fac-
tors, clinical and social support structure, and variables such
as physical activity level, nutrition, and counseling.15-17 It
stands to reason that a surgeon’
s operative abilities also have
an effect on outcomes but prior metrics have been limited.
Proxies for a surgeon’
s skill, such as hospital volume and
advanced fellowship training, have been found to be corre-
lated with outcomes.18 However, these metrics fail to
address many attributes associated with a surgeon’
s skill,
such as dexterity, precision, tissue handling, flow of opera-
tion, tissue exposure, and intraoperative decision-making
skills. By analyzing peer-reviewed ratings of surgical videos,
we had a unique opportunity to investigate the effect of
these metrics on surgical outcomes.
Our study indicates that surgical skill does not have a pro-
foundeffectonlong-termoutcomesafterLRYGB,whichstands
in contrast to our prior study demonstrating a strong positive
association between surgeon skill level and 30-day complica-
tion rates.7 Why would one expect surgical skill to be associ-
ated with long-term outcomes? There are multiple ways in
which surgical skill could lead to poor long-term outcomes.
First, skill could affect long-term outcomes as delayed se-
quelae of the initial complication (eg, a perioperative sleeve
leak turning into a stricture or reflux). Second, intraoperative
skilldeficienciescouldleaddirectlytolong-termproblems.For
example, cork-screwing or kinking of the sleeve may not cause
immediate problems but could ultimately manifest as stric-
ture or gastroesophageal reflux. Finally, both of these short-
and long-term complications may lead to additional hospital-
izations or contribute to the patient’
s inability to adhere to the
multidisciplinary weight loss or exercise programs.
One possible reason for our finding is that the videos were
rated for surgical skill alone and did not take into account
technique-specific differences between each operation. That is
to say, we measured how well each surgeon executed the vari-
ousstepsoftheprocedure(surgicalskill)butdidnotanalyzethe
steps themselves (operative technique). Given the likely varia-
tioninsurgeons’judgmentaboutoperativetechnique(ie,pouch
size, length of roux limb, length of biliopancreatic limb, type of
anastomosis, and management of hiatal hernias), there may be
specific technical measures of quality affecting long-term out-
comes that were not measured in this study. Another plausible

selected video that was deemed to be typical. It is possible that
the videos submitted demonstrated their very best single per-
formance and not their overall practice. However, we previ-
ously performed a sensitivity analysis using a second video
sample for each of the high- and low-performing surgeons, and
there was a high level of consistency between videos.7
Third, there was no attempt to standardize or train the
video raters and, owing to the large number of reviewers, no
2 surgeons were evaluated by the same set of raters. Never-
theless, there remained considerable differences among the
skill ratings between each video and we noted high interrater
reliability(0.85to0.97acrosstheskill-ratingdomains).Fourth,
our skill ratings were obtained at a single point; however, our
patient outcomes were measured over a several-year period.
Surgeon skill may not have been static over this period as prac-
ticing surgeons refined their technique; an improved level of
skillovertimewouldpotentiallybiasourfindingstowardanull
result. However, all surgeons in our cohort had been in prac-
tice for similar durations (mean of 11 years in both the top and
bottom quartiles), so a significant change in performance over
time would have been expected in either group.
Finally, our ratings only measured surgeons’skill for dis-
crete portions of the operation: pouch creation, gastrojeju-
nostomy, and jejunojejunostomy. These 3 videos were se-
lected because we believed that they represented the most
technicallychallengingportionsoftheoperation,buttheymay
notreflectalloftheeventsthatoccurredintheoperatingroom.
Another aspect of surgical quality that was not measured in
this study was the judgment and variation in surgical tech-
nique from surgeon to surgeon. Although surgical skill may ac-
countfordifferencesinshort-termcomplicationrates,itispos-
sible that operative technique (as discussed here) may account
for long-term outcomes.
Our study has several important implications for practice.
Recently, attention has turned to trying to better evaluate and
improve the conduct of an operation as a whole through video
and live coaching initiatives.20 Laparoscopic surgery is a prime
target of such work because videos are simple to obtain using
existingequipmentaspartofroutinepracticeandthereforerep-
resentanuntappeddatasourceforstudyingbothoperativetech-
niqueandsurgicalskill.Theseeffortshaveidentifiedtheimpor-
tance of measuring both operative technique and surgical skill
as well as better understanding the complex interplay between
the two. We believe this present study is an important negative
result because it informs this ongoing work by providing infor-
mation on which outcomes we should expect to be affected by
improvingsurgeonskillandwhichwillnotbeaffected.Further

cedures and a diverse set of outcomes so we can better under-
stand which outcomes are most dependent on surgical skill.
Conclusions
Peer-review ratings of surgical skill did not affect postopera-
tive weight loss or resolution of medical comorbidities at 1 year
afterlaparoscopicgastricbypass.Althoughsurgicalskillmayin-
fluence short-term complication rates and patient satisfaction
ratings, these findings suggest that long-term outcomes after
bariatric surgery may be more dependent on other factors not
yet measured among patients, hospitals, or surgeons. Future
studies should take advantage of video analysis by measuring
both operative technique and surgical skill as a means of un-
derstanding a surgeon’
s effect on surgical quality.
