Purpose: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare malignancy with a dismal median 
survival of <12 months with current therapy. Single and combination chemotherapy regimens 
have shown only modest clinical benefit. In preclinical studies, nitrogen-containing bisphos-
phonates (zoledronic acid) inhibit growth of mesothelioma cells by different mechanisms: 
inhibition of mevalonate pathway, inhibition of angiogenesis, activation of apoptosis through 
caspase activation, and alteration in activity of matrix metalloproteinases, thereby affecting 
invasiveness of cancer cells.
Patients and methods: We investigated the role of zoledronic acid in a pilot, single-arm trial 
of MPM patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 
0–2 who had progressed on prior treatments or had not received systemic therapy due to poor 
PS. Primary end point was composite response rate by modified response evaluation criteria in 
solid tumors and/or metabolic response by 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-d-glucose (18F-FDG) 
positron emission tomography criteria. Secondary end points were progression-free survival 
(PFS) and overall survival (OS). Exploratory end points include the effect of zoledronic acid 
therapy on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor, interleukin 
8, transforming growth factor beta, mesothelin, and osteopontin levels.
Results: Eight male patients (median age of 62 years) with the following clinical characteristics 
were treated; ECOG PS was 0–2, 75% with epithelioid type, and 62% had prior chemotherapy. 
Overall composite response rate was 12.5% and the clinical benefit rate (response + stable 
disease) was 37.5%. Median PFS was 2 months (0.5–21 months) and median OS was 7 months 
(0.8–28 months). No treatment-related toxicities were observed. Lower VEGF levels were pre-
dictive of favorable response and mesothelin levels correlated with disease course.
Conclusion: Zoledronic acid shows modest clinical activity without significant toxicity in 
patients with advanced MPM.
Keywords: mesothelioma, treatment, bisphosphonates
Introduction
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive tumor of serosal surfaces. Its 
incidence is increasing worldwide due to asbestos use.1 MPM occurs mainly in men, 
aged 60–80 years, and the majority of them die due to local extension and/or respiratory 
failure.1,2 Median survival of patients ranges from 12 to 19 months with combination 
chemotherapy. Pemetrexed plus cisplatin, the current standard chemotherapy regimen, 
yield a median overall survival (OS) of 12.1 months and a median time to progression 
of 5.7 months.3 Poor prognostic markers include: poor performance status (PS), high

leukocyte count, high platelet count (>400,000/µL), nonepi-
thelial tumor type, and male gender.4 Despite new chemo-
therapy combinations, MPM patient outcome is  
modest,5–11 
thus a great need for improvement exists.
Bisphosphonates are osteoporosis drugs that have been 
in clinical use for decades.12 In addition to their antiresorp-
tive effects in osteoporosis and cancer-induced osteolytic 
bone disease, nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (such as 
zoledronic acid and risedronic acid) inhibit tumor prolifera-
tion.12–14 Zoledronic acid effectively inhibits proliferation of 
mesothelioma cell lines in vitro and in vivo.15 This result is 
likely an outcome of mevalonate pathway inhibition,12,16 lead-
ing to depletion of prenyl groups needed in posttranslational 
modification and activation of small GTPases,14 ultimately 
inhibiting cell growth. In addition, zoledronic acid reduces 
experimental malignant pleural effusions.17 It demonstrates 
antiangiogenic effects18–20 and suppresses vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF) blood levels.21 VEGF levels have been 
associated with MPM progression and poor survival22,23 in 
relation to high tumor microvessel density.22,24
Computed  tomography (CT) response evaluation criteria 
in solid tumors (RECIST) is difficult to use in MPM due 
to circumferential and axial growth. Thus, MPM response 
to treatment is usually measured with imaging using 
modified RECIST assessment criteria.25 MPM is 2-deoxy-2-
[fluorine-18]fluoro-d-glucose (18F-FDG) positron emission 
tomography (PET) avid,26 and 18F-FDG PET scans can be 
used to document early responses27,28 and have been useful 
in the assessment of prognosis and staging.29,30 Mesothelin 
and osteopontin are glycoproteins that are overexpressed in 
mesothelioma and are associated with tumor progression. 
Serum markers such as mesothelin and osteopontin are of 
interest for prognosis, tumor response, and tumor progres-
sion.31–33 On the basis of these findings, we conducted a 
pilot, proof-of-concept feasibility study of zoledronic acid 
in the treatment of advanced MPM. We measured the levels 
of antiangiogenic factors (VEGF, bFGF, IL-8, and TGF-β), 
mesothelin, and osteopontin before and during treatment.
Patients and methods
Study design and patients
This single-arm, prospective study was conducted at the Uni-
versity of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer 
Center. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate 
the antitumor activity of zoledronic acid in subjects with unre-
sectable, advanced MPM assessed by the modified RECIST 
criteria,25 and/or metabolic response 18F-FDG PET assess-
ment.34 The secondary objectives were to assess duration of 
response, progression-free survival (PFS), OS, and safety and 
tolerability of zoledronic acid in MPM patients. Blood levels 
of VEGF, bFGF, IL-8, TGF-β, mesothelin, and osteopontin 
were measured to investigate the influence of zoledronic acid.
Inclusion criteria included: adult patients (age>18) with 
unresectable MPM who had progressed after one or more 
prior systemic therapies, had not received prior systemic 
therapy due to poor PS, and/or were unwilling to receive 
systemic chemotherapy. Other eligibility criteria included 
life expectancy of at least 2 months, measurable disease by 
CT or 18F-FDG PET, willing to consent to contraception (if 
applicable), and ability to provide consent. Exclusion cri-
teria were brain metastasis, second cancer diagnosis, heart 
disease (class 3 or 4 heart failure by New Y
ork Heart failure 
classification), acute coronary syndrome (within 6 months), 
known human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis, clinically 
significant arrhythmias, serious acute systemic disease, dental 
disease, and history of osteonecrosis of the jaw.
This study was approved by the Institutional Review 
Board at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Com-
prehensive Cancer Center. Written informed consent was 
obtained from all study participants.
The study was registered with the National Clinical Trials 
Network, number NCT01204203.
Treatment and assessments
Study schema is presented in Figure 1. Patients were 
treated with intravenous (IV) infusion of zoledronic acid 
(Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ, USA) 4 mg 
IV over 15 minutes on day 1 of a 3-week cycle. Patients 
were evaluated for response every 2 cycles with CT scans 
and 18F-FDG PET scans only on cycle 2. Subjects with 
either stable disease or response continued treatment until 
disease progression and/or intolerable toxicity at which 
patients were taken off study. Dose adjustment was allowed 
per standard guidelines for zoledronic acid for decreased 
creatinine clearance. Subjects were monitored for toxic-
ity using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events Version 3.0 criteria. Patients 
who completed at least one treatment cycle were included 
in data analysis.
Sample collection and analysis for 
correlative objectives
Blood samples for VEGF, bFGF, IL-8, TGF-β, mesothelin, 
and osteopontin were collected prior to treatment on days 1 
and 8 of cycle 1 and then prior to treatment on day 1 of cycles 
2, 3, and 6. Plasma samples were aliquoted and stored at

−70°C. Blood levels of these biomarkers were analyzed using 
ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) kits from 
R&D systems (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) 
Quantikine assays, according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical analysis
Responses were assessed as composite response rate which 
include modified RECIST objective responses and metabolic 
response 18F-FDG PET assessment. Data are presented as 
descriptive statistics. OS and PFS are presented as median, 
whereas VEGF, bFGF, IL-8, TGF-β, mesothelin, and osteo-
pontin are presented as mean values.
Results
Demographics
From November 2010 to January 2015, 9 patients con-
sented, but only 8 patients were treated. All patients were 
male (7 Caucasian and 1 African-American), median age 
of 62 years (age range 49–77), and Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group ( ECOG) PS 0–2. Three patients were 
never-smokers. One patient had stage 2 disease, and 7 patients 
had stage 4 disease. The majority of the patients (n=6) had 
epithelioid mesothelioma. All except 2 patients reported a 
history of asbestos exposure. All patients included in this 
study had symptomatic, active disease with measurable 
parameters by CT and PET scans; previously treated patients 
had progressive symptomatic disease after the last line of 
treatment. Three patients were treatment naïve, whereas oth-
ers had received one or more lines of chemotherapy agents, 
including pemetrexed/cisplatin or carboplatin, single-agent 
carboplatin, pemetrexed, and cediranib.
Treatment outcomes
Median duration of follow-up was 1.3 months  
(0.3–21 months), 
median number of treatment cycles was 2 (1–28 cycles). 
Baseline tumor parameters and response assessment after 
cycle 2 of treatment are summarized in Table 1. No response

criteria; 2 patients had the best response of stable disease, 
1 response lasted 21 months. When assessed with 18F-FDG 
PET, 1 patient with stable disease by modified RECIST had 
partial response by 18F-FDG PET criteria, whereas another 
patient thought to have progressive disease by modified 
RECIST had stable disease by 18F-FDG PET criteria. Over-
all composite response rate was 12.5%. Clinical benefit 
rate (response + stable disease) was 37.5%. Median PFS 
was 2 months (0.5–21 months). Median OS was 7 months 
(0.8–28 months). The histopathological characteristics of the 
MPM responders include 1 epithelioid and 1 mixed histol-
ogy; all 6 MPM nonresponders had epithelioid histology. No 
treatment-related toxicities were observed.
Correlative studies result
Higher baseline levels of VEGF and osteopontin were 
observed in nonresponders (Table 2). Decreasing levels 
of mesothelin and osteopontin were seen in patients with 
response or stable disease. Zoledronic acid initially led to 
increase in VEGF levels in all patients with subsequent 
decrease. Increasing VEGF levels was seen in patients with 
progressive disease. No association with disease burden or 
progression was seen with IL-8, bFGF, or TGF-β.
Discussion
This pilot feasibility study assessed whether bisphospho-
nates could have a role in the treatment of mesothelioma 
due to their antiangiogenic properties. Our findings suggest 
that zoledronic acid has single-agent activity in MPM treat-
ment. Angiogenesis is a complex process, difficult to target 
due to multiple VEGF-dependent and VEGF-independent 
pathways.35,36 Multiple antiangiogenic agents have been 
previously used for the treatment of MPM; however, 
responses have been modest with bevacizumab having 
the most evidence.37–47 A recent publication reporting the 
combination of bevacizumab with pemetrexed and cisplatin 
showed increased PFS and OS.41 Zoledronic acid can mitigate 
angiogenesis at subcellular level by mevalonate pathway 
inhibition and is beneficial in antitumor therapy.14,15,48–50 In 
our study, clinical benefit in at least 2 patients was observed 
without toxicity, which makes this drug an attractive agent 
for combination with chemotherapy or other antiangiogenic 
agents for future trials. Lower VEGF levels were associated 
with favorable responses similar to previous results.41,42,51 
However, an interesting finding was the initial increase and 
then decrease in VEGF levels with zoledronic therapy in 
responder patients (Table 2). It has been shown that maximal 
tolerated chemotherapy increases the expression of VEGF 
and other proangiogenic growth factors in a rebound response 
to treatment. It is possible that similar initial rebound effect 
can be seen with zolendronic acid in responders; and more 
profound effect in nonresponders, indicative of an adaptive 
(evasive) mechanism of resistance.52
IL-8 and bFGF, which have been shown to enhance neovas-
cularization and promote tumor growth,53 did not correlate with 
zoledronic acid therapy. Serum mesothelin levels are elevated 
in MPM, but is not used as a biomarker for diagnosis due to low 
sensitivity.31,54,55 It has been shown to correlate with progno-
sis56–58 and has been a target for MPM immunotherapy.59,60 Our 
study reports that mesothelin and osteopontin levels decline in 
patients who have favorable therapy response and potentially 
may represent promising biomarkers of this disease.
In our patient population, as well as in the SEER Cancer 
Statistics, the incidence of mesothelioma is much more com-
mon in men than in women.61 This prevalence is reflected 
in the demographic data of our study. Previous studies have 
shown women diagnosed with mesothelioma typically have 
more favorable outcomes and a statistically better chance of 
survival than males.61
Conclusion
Our pilot study suggests modest activity of zoledronic acid 
as a single agent in the treatment of mesothelioma and war-
rants further investigation in combination with other agents.
