Abstract
Objective—To determine if well-child visits are a risk factor for subsequent influenza-like 
illness (ILI) visits within a child's family.
Design—Retrospective cohort
Methods—Using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey from the years 1996-2008, we 
identified 84,595 families. For each family, we determined those weeks in which a well-child visit 
or an ILI visit occurred. We identified 23,776 well-child-visit weeks and 97,250 ILI-visit weeks. 
We fit a logistic regression model, where the binary dependent variable indicated an ILI clinic 
visit in a particular week. Independent variables included binary indicators to denote a well-child 
visit in the concurrent week or one of the previous two weeks, the occurrence of the ILI visit 
during the influenza season, and the presence of children in the family in each of the age groups 
0-3, 4-7, 8-17. Socioeconomic variables were also included. We also estimated the overall cost of 
well-child-exam-related ILI using data from 2008.
Results—We found that an ILI office visit by a family member was positively associated with a 
well-child visit in the same or one of the previous two weeks (OR: 1.54). This additional risk 
translates to potentially 778,974 excess cases of ILI per year in the US with a cost of 500 million 
dollars annually.
Conclusions—Our results should encourage ambulatory clinics to strictly enforce infection 
control recommendations. In addition, clinics could consider time-shifting of well-child visits so 
as not to coincide with the peak of the influenza season.

 BACKGROUND
The majority of preventive healthcare for children is administered during routine well-child 
visits. During these visits vaccinations are administered, screenings are performed and 
developmental milestones are assessed.[1] Well-child visits occur annually in children after 
age three and more frequently before.[1] These visits often occur in the same clinics as 
acute-care visits. Among younger children, respiratory infections generate a substantial 
number of acute care visits.[2] Unfortunately, these infections may spread in waiting and 
exam rooms. Routes of transmission include droplets, the hands of healthcare workers, and 
environmental contamination.[3-5]
To prevent the spread of infections to patients during well-child visits, several approaches 
are used. In addition to stressing the importance of hand hygiene and environmental 
cleanliness, some clinics have attempted to restrict the use of communal toys, and opened 
segregated well-child waiting areas.[6] However, even with these interventions, exam rooms 
are usually not segregated. In addition, hand-hygiene compliance and environmental 
cleaning are routinely not optimal.[7] Overcrowding during respiratory-virus season may 
further increase the risk of transmission.
Knowing the level and timing of elevated risk during ambulatory care may allow 
rearranging or rescheduling of well-child visits so they do not occur during the peak of the 
influenza season. However, little information exists about the scale of the problem in 
pediatric offices. The purpose of this paper is to determine if well-child visits are a risk 
factor for subsequent influenza-like illness (ILI) visits within the child's family. We also 
estimate the cost of these subsequent infections on a national level.
METHODS
The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Medical Expenditure Panel Survey 
(MEPS) is a longitudinal, nationally-representative sample of the US population. Primary 
focus areas are healthcare utilization, expenditures and health-related attitudes.[8] For our 
analysis, we used the demographic, office-based, emergency room and outpatient event files 
from years 1996 to 2008. This reflects the entirety of the non-inpatient medical care for each 
subject.
We extracted ILI visits using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) 
codes from the pooled outpatient, office-based and emergency-department visit records. 
Visits were labeled as ILI if they included at least one of the 16 ICD-9 codes listed in 
Marsden-Haug, shown here in Table 1.[9] Next, we extracted well-child visits based on two 
criteria: if the records included ICD-9 codes previously used for well-child visit studies[10] 
or if the primary reason for the visit was “immunizations or shots” or “well-child exam”. We 
focused on well-child visits occurring in patients under the age of 6 to focus on child health 
prior to enrollment in elementary school.
We used the MEPS data to create family units. MEPS provides a dwelling unit ID and 
subclassifies the dwelling unit into families. Combining the unique dwelling unit ID and the 
family ID generates a unique key for each family. Within these families we created an

 indicator variable for each week that a well-child visit occurred for a child under the age of 
6. We also created an indicator variable for each week that an ILI occurred for any family 
member. Because MEPS panels run for 2 years, each family had up to 104 weeks of 
observation. Given the 84,595 families under observation, this translates to 8,053,344 
overall records.
To determine if well-child visits are a risk factor for subsequent ILI visits, we used survey 
weighted logistic regression. For most of our analyses, the unit of analysis was the family. In 
our model, an ILI visit in a particular week was the dependent variable. Independent 
variables included an indicator for the well-child visit risk-window, defined as 1 if there was 
a well-child visit in same or one of the previous two weeks. The consideration of the prior 
two weeks accounts for the delay in presentation of ILI. To control for socio-demographic 
factors, we included the race and education for the MEPS reference, where the reference 
person is the person who rents or owns the dwelling unit for the family. To account for 
access to care, we included whether the reference person had private, public or no insurance. 
Family income was converted to percentage of the poverty level and coded as one 1 of 5 
levels: poor (income > 100% poverty line), near poor (100% to 124%), low income (125% 
to 199%), middle income (200% to 399%) and high income (≥ 400%). To control for the 
effect of other children in the family unit, we also included a series of indicator variables to 
represent the presence of children aged 0-3 years, 4-7 years and 8-17 years. We defined 
these cutoffs empirically. Finally, we included a dummy variable representing whether the 
ILI visit occurred during the influenza season. We defined the influenza season as the 
months of December, January and February. Analysis was done using the Survey package 
and R 3.02.
As a further check of association, we explored the existence of an interaction between the 
influenza season and the well-child visits. If infections are acquired during well-child care, 
we would expect the effect of well-child visits on subsequent ILI visits to be elevated during 
the influenza season. Additionally, as a sensitivity analysis, we assessed the effect of the 
chosen risk-window for the well-child visit by shortening it by a week to include only the 
same or the previous week as the ILI visit. We also modified the definition of well-child 
visit to be only those visits in children aged 3 and under.
To evaluate the cost of well-child-related ILI, we used the MEPS data for 2008 to obtain an 
estimate that is adjusted by the MPES survey-sampling weights. Using the model without 
interactions, we calculated the difference in risk of an ILI visit for every family with a well-
child visit compared to the counterfactual of no well-child visit. We estimated the total 
increase in risk during the well-child visit risk-window with all covariates except for the 
well-child indicator held constant. Using the MEPS covariates allows us to make more 
accurate estimates of the total increase in risk than, for example, considering the effect of a 
well-child visit with the other covariates set at their mean/modal values. The resulting 
estimate is more reflective of the total national burden. We estimated the average increased 
risk using a survey weight adjusted mean of the computed increased risk for each family. 
Using the total annual number of cases and economic burden of outpatient influenza 
reported by Molinari and colleagues, we estimate the mean cost of a case of outpatient

 influenza as $642.06.[11] This estimate reflects direct medical costs and indirect costs such 
as lost work.
RESULTS
During our study period of 13 years, we followed 84,595 families. We found 23,776 family-
weeks with a well-child visit in children under age six. We also detected 97,520 family-
weeks with an ILI visit among family members of any age.
The results from our model exploring the risk factors for ILI visits at a family level are 
shown in Table 2. We found that a lack of insurance was associated with reduced odds of 
having ILI office visits. Families on public insurance were more likely to have ILI office 
visit than their privately insured peers. In terms of race, we found that whites were the most 
likely group to have an ILI visit. Higher income and higher education levels were also 
positively associated with ILI visits. Families with young children were more likely to have 
an ILI visit. As expected, the influenza season was associated with increased risk for ILI.
Finally, we found that even when controlling for all of the preceding factors, the occurrence 
of an ILI office visit by a family member was strongly associated with a well-child visit in 
the same or either of the two previous weeks. In fact, the odds of an ILI visit for a family 
with a well-child visit in the same or either of the prior two weeks were 1.54 (p<0.0001) 
times that of a family without a well-child visit in this time period.
The inclusion of the interaction term between the influenza season and the well-child visit 
indicator slightly attenuated the main effect of the well-child visit (OR 1.46, p<0.0001). This 
is because the estimate in the additive model reflects the average burden over the year. If a 
well-child visit was additively more risky during the influenza season, that relationship 
would be captured by the influenza season variable. If a well-child office visit elevates the 
log odds of an ILI visit to a greater extent during the influenza season, we would expect the 
interaction term to be positive. This could be the case if the influenza season created greater 
ILI volume in the clinic, thereby increasing the exposure during a well-child office visit. The 
interaction between the well-child and influenza season indicator variables was significant 
and positive (OR 1.18, p = 0.0114). This suggests that the effect of a well-child visit on 
increasing the risk for subsequent ILI is more pronounced during the influenza season.
Neither of our two sensitivity analyses alter our results. If we shorten the risk window by 
one week, the OR remains practically constant at 1.56 (p < 0.0001). Likewise, if we restrict 
to only the 26,786 well-child visits in patients aged 3 or younger we arrive at an OR of 1.50 
(p <0.0001). In comparison, defining well-child office patients to be 5 or younger and 
including the same and prior two weeks in the risk window yields the OR of 1.54 
(p<0.0001).
Using the family characteristics and sampling design in MEPS for 2008 and without 
considering the interaction between influenza season and well-child office visits, we arrive 
at an average 3.17 percentage points (interquartile range: 2.44 – 3.91) increase in the 
probability of an ILI office visit in the week of or two weeks following a well-child visit. 
When the sample weights are applied, this reflects a potential excess of 778,974 ILI office

 visits. Using $642.06 as the estimated economic burden of outpatient influenza, we arrive at 
an annual cost of $500,147,992. Repeating this computation using the model with an 
interaction term yields a comparable increase in the probability of an ILI office visit (3.12%, 
IQR 2.13 – 3.72). Using the estimate with the interaction and the sampling weights as 
before, we estimate 766,151 additional ILI office visits and $491,914,592 annual costs.
DISCUSSION
Our results demonstrate that well-child visits are associated with ILI visits during the week 
of and two weeks following a well-child visit. Specifically, we find a 3.17 percentage point 
increase in the probability of an ILI visit based on a well-child visit in the concurrent week 
or either of the previous two weeks. Although this risk is relatively small, the number of 
well-child visits on a national level is not. We estimate 778,974 potentially-avoidable ILI 
visits for a total economic burden of over half a billion dollars in 2008. Given that actual 
provider-based visits measure only a fraction of ILI episodes, this may substantially 
underestimate the potential risk of well-child visits.
Children and their family members attending well-child visits are certainly at risk for 
acquiring infections. However, it has been much harder to document the risk factors for 
infections from ambulatory exposures than hospital-associated infections. Exposures to 
some diseases in ambulatory clinics are easier to diagnose based on ease of transmission, 
clinical presentation and how common the infections are in general. For example, in the U.S. 
during some outbreaks, a substantial percentage of measles cases were linked to exposures 
in ambulatory care environments.[12-13] Transmission of tuberculosis has also been linked 
to exposures in pediatric clinics.[14-15] However, exposures and transmission of infections 
that occur commonly in the community are not reported, and this may be due to the 
difficulty of attributing exposure to office visits.[5] One study of 127 children was designed 
to determine the risk of acquiring an infection in the week following a pediatric office visit. 
This study did not detect an increased risk following the visit.[16] Another study of 304 
children, 137 of whom had an emergency department visit, did not find an increased risk of 
infection.[17] A similar larger study of emergency department visits among elderly residents 
of long-term-care facilities (1269 participants, 424 of whom visited the emergency 
department) found that a visit was associated with a 3-fold increase in the risk of a 
subsequent acute infection.[18]
The unique design of the MEPS enabled us to do a much larger investigation than has been 
done previously. We were able to capture important variables that may explain access to 
care, the timing of the visits, and most importantly, the potential for capturing possible ILI 
visits among family members, not just the patients attending the well-child visits. In 
addition, we were able to capture visits that occur in multiple settings across healthcare and 
payer systems.
Our results stress the importance of infection-control in ambulatory settings. Infection-
prevention- and-control guidelines for pediatric clinics exist, and these highlight a number of 
interventions that may be undertaken. Many policies focus on reducing the transmission of 
respiratory infections. These include improving environmental cleaning, respiratory hygiene

 and cough etiquette, and hand-hygiene compliance.[3-5] The last two interventions can be 
practiced by both patients and their family members as well as healthcare workers to reduce 
risk. In fact, the most effective approach to infection control in ambulatory settings involves 
the sharing and coordination of information at an early stage. The American Academy of 
Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases states that “Infection prevention and control 
should start at the time an ambulatory visit is scheduled and is important in every patient 
encounter.”[3] We would argue that this approach should be taken even further so that 
infection control starts before the well-child visit is scheduled.
Currently, the timing of well-child visits does not exploit information that could decrease the 
risk of respiratory viruses. Well-child visits are often based on patients’ birthdays as a 
convenient way to ensure complete and timely vaccinations. It may be possible that 
changing scheduling by a few weeks, based on local influenza patterns, may decrease 
exposures and secondary illnesses for both children attending well-child visits and their 
family members. An alternative would be to decrease the number of well-child visits 
scheduled during the peak “influenza season.” This approach may make staffing clinics 
easier: the upswing in activity due to the respiratory virus season often provides greater 
demand for acute care services. However, any potential benefits from shifting well child 
visits to avoid the peak of influenza season need to be weighed against possible disruptions 
in routine vaccination scheduling. Thus, we think that before any changes to well-child 
scheduling are even considered, reinforcing and implementing currently recommended 
clinic-based infection control guidelines should be most vigorously pursued. The well-child 
visits are not generating additional ILI cases, it is the possible exposures that occur -- many 
of which could be mitigated via better infection control practices -- that are generating the 
additional ILI cases. There are several limitations to our study. First, we captured ILI visits 
using the administrative codes provided by MEPS. These diagnoses were not based on 
microbiological data (e.g., cultures, chart reviews). Also, because the MEPS data only 
includes the first three digits of the ICD-9 codes, it is possible that we are misclassifying 
some events. However, the first three digits provide clinically meaningful categories that are 
likely specific enough for this study.
Second, we do not know which family members were exposed at a visit or the extent of the 
exposure. However, we did observe an increase in risk for ILI visits following well-child 
visits for the patient. This lends support to the estimates obtained considering the entire 
family. Third, the analysis did not consider influenza vaccination habits among the family. 
However, vaccination for all children 6 months to 4 years was recommended for the 
2007-2008 influenza season and for all children with the 2008-2009 season. Children 
presenting at well-child visits are potentially likely to be vaccinated or offered vaccination 
against the influenza. This would tend to bias our findings towards the null of no 
association.
Fourth, it is possible that the relationship that we found between well-child visits and ILI is 
caused by a common temporal relationship with an omitted variable such as the school year. 
However, this is not likely: ILI visits are highly seasonal, but well-child visits are not. We 
also considered multiple alternative definitions of the influenza season, but these alternative 
definitions yielded essentially the same results (data not shown).

 Finally, our findings may be based on some omitted variables not captured by MEPS that 
are associated with both well-child visits and ILI visits, like care-seeking behavior. 
However, we included the variables that were available in MEPS that could be associated 
with care seeking (parents’ education and insurance status, for example). Note that many of 
these variables were statistically significant, but the estimated odds ratios for many of these 
variables were relatively small compared to that of the well-child visit variable, the focus of 
our study (See Table 2). In addition, when we repeat the analysis but replace the ILI office 
visit with an outpatient office visit for a sprain or strain, we find no significant increase in 
risk based on a well-child visit in the same week or either of the previous two weeks (OR 
1.18, 95% CI 0.94 – 1.45). We found no causal relationship between well-child care and 
these injuries except for differences in care seeking preferences between families with and 
without well-child visits. The lack of a significant increase in risk of a sprain or strain in the 
weeks following well-child visits, in addition to the relatively small odds ratios for the other 
included variables, suggests that our finding is unlikely to be the result of care-seeking 
behavior by families who schedule and attend well-child visits.
Despite our limitations, we provide some of the first evidence for what many have 
suspected: ambulatory exposures are a potential risk factor for respiratory infections. We 
believe that attendance at well-child visits is critically important for preventing infections 
through vaccination and the benefits far outweigh the risks. Nonetheless, our results stress 
the importance of improving compliance with current infection-control guidelines for 
ambulatory settings, not just for well-child visits, but for all office visits.
