Context: Recent studies have suggested that a subgroup of obese individuals is not at increased
risk of obesity-related complications. This subgroup has been referred to as metabolically
healthy obese.
Objective: To investigate whether obesity is a risk factor for development of ischemic heart disease
(IHD) irrespective of metabolic health.
Design: In all, 6238 men and women from the Danish prospective Inter99 study were followed
during 10.6 (standard deviation = 1.7) years.
Setting: General community.
Participants: Participants were classified according to body mass index and four metabolic risk
factors (low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, triglycerides, and
fasting plasma glucose). Metabolically healthy individuals were defined as having no
metabolic risk factors, and metabolically unhealthy individuals were defined as having a
minimum of one.
Main Outcome Measures: IHD.
Results: During follow-up, 323 participants developed IHD. Metabolically healthy obese men had
increased risk of IHD compared with metabolically healthy normal-weight men [hazard ratio (HR),
3.1; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1 to 8.2)]. The corresponding results for women were less
pronounced (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 0.7 to 4.8). Being metabolically healthy but overweight was not
associated with higher risk of IHD in men (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.5 to 2.4), and in women the risk was only
slightly increased and insignificant (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.8 to 3.0). A substantial proportion of
metabolically healthy individuals became metabolically unhealthy after 5 years of follow-up.
When these changes in exposure status were taken into account, slightly higher risk estimates
were found.
Conclusions: Being obese is associated with higher incidence of IHD irrespective of metabolic status,
and we question the feasibility of denoting a subgroup of obese individuals as metabolically healthy.

 O
verweight and obesity are major public health con-
cerns with both individual and socioeconomic con-
sequences(1). In 2014, .1.9 billion adults were overweight,
including ;600 million obese (2). A subgroup of obese
individuals has been identified with lower risk of de-
veloping obesity-related complications than expected
according to their level of obesity (1). This subgroup has
been referred to as metabolically healthy obese (1).
The concept of metabolically healthy obesity has been
discussed during the past decade, and the conclusions
are ambiguous. Some studies have reported that meta-
bolically healthy obese individuals are not at increased
risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) com-
pared with the metabolically healthy normal-weight
or metabolically healthy nonobese individuals (3–10).
Conversely, other studies indicate that metabolically
healthy obese individuals are at increased risk of CVD
compared with metabolically healthy normal-weight
individuals (11–16).
Some studies found diverging results when using dif-
ferent definitions or outcomes or when stratifying by
ethnicity and sex (17–21). Some of the discrepancy be-
tween the results relates to the use of different definitions
of metabolic health and outcomes. In other words, there
is lack of consensus in the way metabolically healthy
obesity is defined (22, 23). In their main analyses, most
previous studies allowed the metabolically healthy in-
dividuals to have at least one metabolic risk factor (3–8,
10–21, 24), limiting the interpretation of the findings, as
risk factors differ within and between study populations,
and they might affect the risk of CVD differently.
To better guide clinicians regarding CVD prevention,
it is important to establish (1) whether obesity per se
contributes to CVD in individuals with a metabolically
healthy profile, and (2) whether metabolically healthy
obesity is a permanent or a transient state. The aim of this
study was therefore to investigate whether obesity is a risk
factor for ischemic heart disease (IHD) irrespective of
metabolic health using longitudinal data from a large
Danish prospective cohort study. The current study uses a
strict definition of metabolic health, defining metaboli-
cally healthy individuals as having none of the classical
metabolic CVD risk factors.
Subjects and Methods
Study population
This study is embedded in the Inter99 study, which is a
Danish randomized nonpharmacological intervention study
with the primary purpose of preventing IHD in the Danish
population through lifestyle changes (25). The Inter99 study
has been described in detail elsewhere (25).
In brief, 12,934 individuals living in the southwestern
part of Copenhagen County were invited for a clinical health
examination in 1999 to 2001. Of these individuals, 6784
(52.5%) participated in a baseline examination. The par-
ticipants were asked to complete a questionnaire, which
included questions on lifestyle, education, chronic diseases,
and psychosocial factors (25).
Before the baseline examination, the participants were
prerandomized to high-intensity intervention (group A, 90%)
or low-intensity intervention (group B, 10%) (25). Participants
in group A, who were assessed as being at high risk of IHD, were
offered participation in six group meetings on either smoking
cessation, smoking reduction, or diet and physical activity.
Participants at high risk in group B were referred to their gen-
eral practitioner. Participants at low risk in groups A and B were
not offered intervention (25).
After 5 years of follow-up the participants were invited for a
re-examination, and after 10 years of follow-up information on
IHD from Danish health care registries was collected on all
participants.
A previous analysis evaluating the effect of the intervention
in the Inter99 study found that the high-intensity intervention
had no effect on IHD (26).
Definition of the outcome
Information on fatal and nonfatal IHD was obtained from
both the National Hospital Registry and the Cause of Death
Registry. The diagnosis at discharge and the date of the first
hospitalization with IHD were used to define an event of IHD.
In cases with no prior hospitalization with IHD, the date of
death due to IHD was used as the date of diagnosis.
To define IHD, the International Classification of Diseases-10
codes I20 to I25 and International Classification of Diseases-8
codes 410 to 413 were used. Additionally, procedures relevant
to IHD were included (Supplemental Table 1).
Definition and measure of body mass index and
metabolic health
The exposure was defined as a combination of body mass
index (BMI) and metabolic health.
According to the criteria of the World Health Organization,
normal weight was defined as BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2,
overweight as BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m2, and obesity as BMI
of $30 kg/m2 (27). Weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg
with participants wearing indoor clothes, no shoes, and having
no items in their pockets. Height was measured to the nearest
0.5 cm with participants not wearing shoes.
We used a strict definition of being metabolically healthy.
Metabolically healthy individuals were defined as having none
of the following metabolic risk factors: high blood pressure
(systolic blood pressure $ 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood
pressure $ 90 mm Hg), high plasma triglycerides ($1.7 mmol/L),
elevated fasting plasma glucose ($ 6.1 mmol/L), and low plasma
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (men, ,1.0 mmol/L;
women, ,1.2 mmol/L). Individuals with one or more of the
four metabolic risk factors were categorized as metabolically
unhealthy. Participants had been fasting overnight before
the health examination. The participants’ blood pressure was
measured twice after 5 minutes of rest with the participants in a
supine position and the mean systolic and diastolic blood
pressures were calculated. Plasma HDL cholesterol and tri-
glycerides were measured in fasting blood samples by using
enzymatic techniques (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim,
Germany). Furthermore, the participants’ plasma glucose

 concentration was measured in the fasting blood samples using
the hexokinase/glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase technique
(Boehringer Mannheim).
Participants were divided into six exposure groups: (1) met-
abolically healthy normal weight (reference group), (2) meta-
bolically healthy overweight, (3) metabolically healthy obese, (4)
metabolically unhealthy normal weight, (5) metabolically un-
healthy overweight, and (6) metabolically unhealthy obese.
Covariates
Based on standardized questionnaires, information on so-
cioeconomic status, cohabitation, lifestyle factors, stress, and
cardiovascular predisposition was obtained.
The participants were classified as follows: ethnicity—(1)
Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Icelandic, or Faroese origin, or (2)
other origin; socioeconomic status—(1) no work and primary
school only, (2) no work and $1 year of education/vocational
training, (3) work and primary school only, (4) work and 1 to 3
years of education/vocational training, or (5) work and $4 years
of education/vocational training; cohabitation—(1) yes or (2) no.
The variable concerning physical activity takes physical activity at
work and in leisure time into account (sedentary, light, moderate,
high, and very high intensity) (28). Using a 48-item food fre-
quency questionnaire, a dietary quality score was developed (29).
Based on this score, the participants’ dietary habits were con-
sidered as (1) healthy, (2) average, or (3) unhealthy (29). Other
factors included: smoking—(1) daily smoker, (2) occasional
smoker, (3) ex-smoker, or (4) never a smoker; alcohol—the
average number of standard drinks per week.
For stress, information on psychological strain related to
the job was used: (1) yes, (2) sometimes, (3) no, or (4) no job.
To account for predisposition to IHD, a question asking
whether the participants’ parents had experienced an event of
myocardial infarction (MI) was used and the participants were
categorized as (1) yes (one or both parents had an MI), (2) no
(neither parent had an MI), or (3) unknown (MI status un-
known for one parent and no MI for the other parent or
unknown for both parents). To account for the intervention of
the Inter99 study, the participants were categorized as (1)
group A, high risk; (2) group B, high risk; or (3) groups A and
B, low risk.
Study sample
Of the 6784 participants, 65 participants with previous IHD
were excluded. Furthermore, 37 participants were excluded due
to (1) missing information on BMI, (2) missing information on
all metabolic risk factors used to compute the exposure variable,
or (3) missing information on one or more of the metabolic risk
factors and favorable values on the rest of the metabolic vari-
ables. Hence, among these participants it was not possible to
compute the exposure. The main analyses include information
on sex, age, ethnicity, smoking, diet, physical activity, and
cohabitation. Thus, participants with missing information on
one or more of these covariates (n = 375) were excluded. Finally,
69 individuals with a BMI of ,18.5 kg/m2 were excluded,
leaving a total of 6238 participants for the main analyses in
this study.
Statistical analyses
Participants were followed in national registers from the date
of the clinical health examination at baseline to the date of the
first event of IHD, emigration, nontraceability in the registers,
death from other causes than IHD, or the last day of follow-up
without an event of IHD, whichever came first. The last day of
follow-up was defined as 31 December 2010. The mean
[standard deviation (SD)] follow-up time was 10.6 (1.7) years.
Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to
estimate the risk of IHD in groups defined by BMI and meta-
bolic health. The crude model was adjusted for age and in-
tervention group (model 1). The main model was further
adjusted for smoking, physical activity, diet, cohabitation, and
ethnicity (model 2). Analyses were conducted for men and
women separately.
To account for changes in exposure status during follow-up,
an analysis was performed where each participant’s time of
follow-up was split in two parts (from baseline to 5 years of
follow-up, and from 5 years of follow-up to 10 years of follow-
up; model 3). When possible, the participants’ exposure status
at 5 years of follow-up was included; that is, if the participant
had no missing values on any of the four metabolic risk factors
or if at least one adverse value was registered. In the latter case,
the participant was categorized as metabolically unhealthy.
Participants with missing information on all metabolic risk
factors at the 5-year follow-up examination maintained their
baseline exposure status during the entire study period. Simi-
larly, participants who had favorable values on the available
metabolic risk factors but missing values on at least one met-
abolic risk factor were included with only their baseline ex-
posure status. Confounders assessed at baseline and 5-year
follow-up were included in the analyses. If confounders were
missing at 5-year follow-up, the value from baseline was in-
cluded. Models 1, 2, and 3 included 6238 participants (3049
men and 3189 women).
For all analyses SAS 9.2 statistical package (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC) was used, and P , 0.05 was considered significant.
Proportional hazards assumption
The assumption of proportional hazards was tested statis-
tically and graphically. Both tests did not reveal any deviations
from proportionality of particular shapes that warrant special
modeling of the interaction. Hence, it is concluded that the
estimates of the relative risk between the groups from the Cox
model give an adequate description of the relative hazards
between the groups.
Sensitivity analyses
Three sensitivity analyses were performed.
Adjustment for additional confounders. Alcohol con-
sumption, socioeconomic status, family history of IHD, and
stress were identified as potential confounders; however, these
covariates were not included in the main Cox model due to a
large number of missing values (alcohol consumption, n = 324;
socioeconomic status, n = 557; family history of MI, n = 285;
and work-related stress, n = 340). The multiple adjusted models
were further adjusted for these covariates to examine whether
the main results were biased due to lack of adjustment. This
analysis included 2639 men and 2701 women.
Changing the definition of obesity. Waist circumference
was used as an alternative measure of obesity. Waist circumference
was defined as normal waist (men, #94 cm; women, #80 cm),
medium waist (men, .94 and #102 cm; women, .80 and

 #88 cm), and large waist (men, .102 cm; women, .88 cm)
(30). Participants with missing information on waist cir-
cumference were excluded, leaving 3049 men and 3179
women for the analysis.
Multiple imputation of missing variables. The analyses of
models 1 and 2 were repeated on a dataset where missing data
on the confounders in the models were imputed using the
multivariate imputations by chained equations method (31)
(mice package in R software) with missing-at-random as-
sumptions. The data set included 6610 participants (3242
men and 3368 women) who had complete information on
exposure variables, BMI $ 18.5 kg/m2, and no previous IHD
events. Fifty copies of the data, each with missing values
suitably imputed, were independently assessed in the sta-
tistical analyses described previously. Estimates of parame-
ters of interest were averaged across the copies according to
Rubin’s rules (32).
Results
Baseline characteristics
Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1 for men
and Table 2 for women.
A total of 58 men and 114 women were categorized
as metabolically healthy obese, which corresponded
to ,3% of the study population. The mean (SD) age was
46.3 (7.8) years among men and 45.7 (8.0) years among
women. Overall, the mean age increased with increasing
BMI, and the mean age was higher among metabolically
unhealthy participants compared with metabolically
healthy participants.
By design, the mean values of the four metabolic risk
factors were more adverse among metabolically un-
healthy participants compared with metabolically healthy
participants. Additionally, within the metabolically
healthy and unhealthy groups the mean values of the
metabolic risk factors worsened with increasing BMI.
Within BMI groups, the mean BMI was higher among
metabolically unhealthy participants compared with met-
abolically healthy participants.
Incidence of IHD
During
follow-up,
206
men
and
117
women
experienced a first event of IHD. Ninety-nine men and 76
women died of other causes than IHD, and 26 men and
20 women emigrated. A total of 2711 men and 2965
women were followed to the last day of follow-up
without an event of IHD.
Table 3 shows the risk of incident IHD among the
exposure groups in 3049 men and 3189 women. The
metabolically healthy normal-weight individuals were
used as reference group. Among both men and women
the risk of IHD was comparable in model 1 (adjusted for
age and intervention) and model 2 (additionally adjusted
for smoking, physical activity, dietary habits, co-
habitation, and ethnicity). Metabolically healthy obese

 men had a threefold increased risk of developing IHD
when compared with metabolically healthy normal-
weight men [hazard ratio (HR), 3.1; 95% confidence
interval (CI), 1.1 to 8.2)]. The increased risk of IHD in
metabolically healthy women being obese (HR, 1.8; 95%
CI, 0.7 to 4.8) or overweight (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.8 to
3.0) was less pronounced and statistically insignificant,
meaning that these groups might not be at increased risk.
Metabolically healthy overweight men were not at in-
creased risk of IHD (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.5 to 2.4).
Furthermore, among metabolically unhealthy individuals
the risk of IHD was increased across all weight groups
in men, whereas among women the increased risk was
only borderline significant in subgroups of normal weight
and obesity.
Change of exposure status during follow-up
A substantial proportion of metabolically healthy
individuals in all weight groups were categorized as
metabolically unhealthy after 5 years of follow-up (Fig. 1).
Additionally, some participants who were categorized as
metabolically unhealthy at baseline were categorized as
metabolically healthy at 5 years of follow-up. When
changes in exposure status during 5 years of follow-up
were taken into account (Table 3, model 3), the results
showed slightly higher risk estimates for all groups except
Table 2.

 among metabolically healthy obese men. The increased
risk among metabolically healthy overweight and obese
women was only borderline significant.
Sensitivity analyses
In a sensitivity analysis the multiple adjusted HRs were
further adjusted for alcohol consumption, socioeconomic
status, family history of MI, and work-related stress in
subgroups of 2639 men and 2701 women (Supplemental
Table 2). The results from this analysis supported the
original findings, and the additional covariates did not
substantially alter the risk of IHD when the multiple-
adjusted model was compared with the age-adjusted model.
When using waist circumference as a measure of
obesity, fewer individuals were characterized as being
overweight or obese. The risk of IHD was not markedly
different from the main analysis (Supplemental Table 3).
However, in this analysis, the risk of IHD was only
borderline significant among metabolically healthy obese
men compared with their leaner counterparts. Further-
more, the metabolically healthy women with a medium
waist circumference were not at increased risk of IHD
compared with metabolically healthy women with a
normal waist circumference.
In the analyses with multiple imputation of missing
data, the HRs were slightly attenuated as compared with
the original analyses, especially among men (Supple-
mental Table 4). However, the same significant results
were found in the original analyses and in the analyses
with multiple imputation; thus, the main findings were
not affected by missing data on confounders.
Discussion
In a large population-based study of .6000 middle-aged
Danish men and women with 10 years of follow-up, we
found that metabolically healthy obese individuals had a
higher risk of IHD compared with their normal-weight
counterparts. However, the increased risk among met-
abolically healthy obese women was only borderline
significant. Hence, the findings in this study do not
support the hypothesis that a subgroup of obese in-
dividuals is at low risk of IHD. In contrast, the results
indicate that obesity is a risk factor for IHD irrespective of
the presence of metabolic risk factors.
Comparison with other studies
The existing evidence displays conflicting results re-
garding the risk of CVD among metabolically healthy
obese individuals compared with metabolically healthy
normal-weight individuals. Thus, the findings of the
present study are in agreement with some studies (11–16)
and partly in agreement with other studies (17–21).
However, the results of this study are in conflict with
studies showing that metabolically healthy obese in-
dividuals are not at increased CVD risk (3–10). It is,
however, difficult to directly compare the results of the
studies due to methodological differences in adjustment
and different definitions of outcomes and metabolic
health. This might explain the inconsistent results across
studies. In line with a recent systematic review (22), we
argue that the definition of metabolic health as having no
metabolic risk factors is more appropriate to interpret the
effect of obesity on IHD over and above the metabolic
status. Furthermore, using a strict definition will make it
easier for clinicians to identify and distinguish between
individuals who are metabolically healthy and unhealthy.
Permanent or temporary condition
It has been discussed whether metabolically healthy
obesity is a temporary condition (1, 33). The finding that
many participants changed exposure status during follow-
up supports this notion. Furthermore, in this study ,3%
of the study population was metabolically healthy obese.
Figure 1. Exposure status after 5 years of follow-up given exposure status at baseline among 2061 men and 2045 women from the Danish
Inter99 study. Participants with missing data on exposure status at year 5 were excluded. Participants with an event of IHD between baseline and
year 5 were also excluded.

 Thus, the metabolically healthy obese phenotype may only
apply to a small proportion of the population, and a sig-
nificant number of this small proportion become meta-
bolically unhealthy over time. Additionally, within the
metabolically healthy groups the mean values of HDL
cholesterol decreased and the mean values of blood
pressure, triglycerides, and fasting plasma glucose con-
centrations increased with increasing BMI. This finding
underscores that CVD risk is continuous and that arbi-
trary cut-off points do not optimally stratify individuals
into low and high risk. Rather, the risk of IHD for
participants below but close to the cut-off point is
probably more similar to the risk of participants slightly
above the cut-off point than the risk of participants with
the lowest values of the particular variable. Furthermore,
results have shown that metabolically healthy obese
women had more subclinical atherosclerosis than meta-
bolically healthy normal-weight women but less than
metabolically unhealthy obese women (34). Taken
together, these findings suggest that the metabolically
healthy obese phenotype is perhaps not a benign condi-
tion, as it has previously been hypothesized. In combi-
nation, these aspects question the rationale of denoting a
subgroup of obese individuals as metabolically healthy.
Strengths and limitations
This study was based on a large prospective cohort
including more than 6000 participants who were fol-
lowed for 10 years. A particular strength of the study was
that we included changes in metabolic health status after
5 years of follow-up. In the definition of the exposure
we used a set of a priori decided cut-off values for each
of the five included continuous variables. These values
were based on well-established cut-off points used by the
World Health Organization, the Danish Society of Car-
diology, and the World Heart Federation (27, 35–37).
However, the categorization of a variable implies an as-
sumption that individuals in the same group are at the
same risk of a specific outcome. This is often not the case,
as also shown in this study.
Owing to the low number of participants and con-
sequently few cases, particularly in the metabolically
healthy obese subgroups, the confidence intervals were
relatively wide; thus, the estimates should be interpreted
with caution. Particularly, we think that the lack of a
statistically significant higher risk among healthy obese
women as compared with men is due to lack of power
rather than to a physiological difference in the role of
obesity on IHD development in men vs women. Another
challenge when studying metabolically healthy obesity is
that individuals could potentially differ on metabolic risk
factors not included in the definition. Plasma glucose
levels measured during an oral glucose tolerance test are
better predictors for future CVD than are fasting glucose
levels (38). However, an oral glucose tolerance test is
often not performed in clinical practice, as it is in-
convenient and costly (39). Also, insulin resistance is
considered a mediator in the association between obesity
and IHD and could differ between the groups. However,
measurement of insulin is costly and no uniform cut-off
value for insulin resistance exists (40). Therefore, these
factors were not included in our analysis. Furthermore,
the use of medication may have improved the values of
the metabolic risk factors and would thus have been
relevant to include in the measure of exposure. However,
medication information was only available for a limited
number of participants and therefore was not included in
the analysis. In addition to medication, residual con-
founding related to measurement errors and other vari-
ables not included in the analysis (e.g. genetic factors) is
also likely to be present in this study.
BMI was used as a measure of obesity. However, BMI
does not take fat distribution into account and does not
distinguish between fat mass and muscle mass (22, 23).
This lack of body fat distinction could explain why
metabolically healthy overweight men were not at in-
creased risk of IHD compared with metabolically healthy
normal-weight men. It is likely that some men charac-
terized as being overweight were muscular and well-
trained, and that the use of BMI has misclassified them
as being overweight. When using large waist circum-
ference as a marker of obesity, neither the metabolically
healthy men nor the metabolically healthy women had
statistically significantly elevated risk of IHD. Because
waist circumference is an equally strong predictor for
CVD as BMI (41), we think that this finding is likely
related to a relatively low number of individuals fulfilling
the criteria for being obese by waist circumference, which
underscores the mismatch between cut-off points for
obesity defined by different measures.
The low participation rate at the baseline health ex-
aminations of the Inter99 study and the exclusion of
participants for this analysis could be a source of concern
regarding generalizability of our findings. Participants
and nonparticipants in the Inter99 study differed at
baseline, as nonparticipants had lower socioeconomic
position, were of younger ages, and more frequently lived
without a partner (42). In the present analysis, we found
that excluded individuals were more likely to be smokers,
have lower socioeconomic position, and were of non-
Nordic origin. Because of these differences, the partici-
pants in this study are not fully representative of the
Danish middle-aged population. However, we think that
similar results would occur in another study population,
as we expect the same mechanisms to underlie the as-
sociation between obesity and IHD.

 Conclusion
In a large prospective study of Danish middle-aged men
and women we found that obesity was associated with
IHD irrespective of metabolic status, especially among
men. The combination of obesity and a metabolically
healthy profile was only present in ,3% of the study
population, and a large majority of those with a meta-
bolically healthy profile at baseline became metabolically
unhealthy after 5 years of follow-up. This finding sug-
gests that metabolically healthy obesity is not a perma-
nent state. In conclusion, our results suggest that the
metabolically healthy obese phenotype is not a benign
condition, and we question the feasibility of denoting a
subgroup of obese individuals as metabolically healthy.
