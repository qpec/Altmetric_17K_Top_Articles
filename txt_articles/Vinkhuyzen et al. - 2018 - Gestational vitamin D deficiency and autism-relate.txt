There is intense interest in identifying modifiable risk factors associated with autism-spectrum disorders (ASD). Autism-related traits,
which can be assessed in a continuous fashion, share risk factors with ASD, and thus can serve as informative phenotypes in
population-based cohort studies. Based on the growing body of research linking gestational vitamin D deficiency with altered brain
development, this common exposure is a candidate modifiable risk factor for ASD and autism-related traits. The association
between gestational vitamin D deficiency and a continuous measure of autism-related traits at ~ 6 years (Social Responsiveness
Scale; SRS) was determined in a large population-based cohort of mothers and their children (n = 4229). 25-hydroxyvitamin D
(25OHD) was assessed from maternal mid-gestation sera and from neonatal sera (collected from cord blood). Vitamin D deficiency
was defined as 25OHD concentrations less than 25 nmol l − 1. Compared with the 25OHD sufficient group (25OHD450 nmol l − 1),
those who were 25OHD deficient had significantly higher (more abnormal) SRS scores (mid-gestation n = 2866, β = 0.06, Po0.001;
cord blood n = 1712, β = 0.03, P = 0.01). The findings persisted (a) when we restricted the models to offspring with European
ancestry, (b) when we adjusted for sample structure using genetic data, (c) when 25OHD was entered as a continuous measure in
the models and (d) when we corrected for the effect of season of blood sampling. Gestational vitamin D deficiency was associated
with autism-related traits in a large population-based sample. Because gestational vitamin D deficiency is readily preventable with
safe, cheap and accessible supplements, this candidate risk factor warrants closer scrutiny.

INTRODUCTION
Autism-spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder
characterised by repetitive or stereotyped behaviours, and deficits
in social relationships.1 Although ASD is a highly heritable
disorder, several candidate environmental risk factors have been
identified such as prenatal and early life exposures related to
infection,2 obstetric complications3,4 and toxin-related exposures.5
Another potential environmental risk factor for ASD is gestational
vitamin D deficiency.6,7 The vitamin D system is best known for its
impact on bone mineral density,8 however optimal concentrations
of vitamin D are also required for brain function, via its role in
calcium signalling, neurotrophic and neuroprotective actions, as
well as its role in neuronal differentiation, maturation and growth.9
There is a growing body of evidence linking gestational vitamin
D deficiency with neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizo-
phrenia and ASD.6,7,10–14 Birth cohort studies have provided
evidence that gestational vitamin D deficiency (based on prenatal
maternal sera) is associated with impairment on a range of
cognitive outcomes related to language, motor development and
general intelligence.15–19 With respect to autism-related traits, an
Australian birth cohort study (n = 406) reported an association
between lower mid-gestation 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD)
concentrations and higher scores on the Attention Switching
subscale of the Autism-Spectrum Quotient.20 Although several
studies have assessed vitamin D status in children with ASD,21 and
one study has compared neonatal vitamin D status in those with
ASD versus their unaffected sibling,22 to the best of our
knowledge, no studies have examined the association between
gestational vitamin D deficiency and autism or autism-related
traits in general population samples.
ASD can be conceptualised as a pronounced and disabling mix
of autism-related traits that also exist in a continuum (from mild to
severe) in the general population.23,24 As healthy individuals vary
substantially in their capacities for social-emotional interactions
and communications, these autism-related traits are thought to
follow a normal distribution within the general population. Family
studies have shown an increase in autism-related traits in relatives
of individuals diagnosed with ASD, suggesting that the same
genetic factors affect both ASD and autism-related behaviours.25
Epidemiological studies have suggested a shared aetiology for
autism-related traits in the general populations and at the
quantitative extremes.26,27 Recently, Robinson et al.28 have shown
that genetic influences on ASD risk also influence typical variation
in the population in autism-related traits such as social-emotional
interaction
and
communication
ability,
suggesting
that
ASD-related phenotypes can be studied in a quantitative manner.
To this end, we have explored the association between
gestational 25OHD concentrations and a widely used parent-
report continuous measure of autism-related traits—the Social
Responsive Scale (SRS).29 We had the opportunity to do so in a
large multi-ethnic population cohort30 where vitamin D concen-
trations were available at two time points: at mid-gestation

 (~21 weeks) taken from maternal serum and at birth (from cord
blood). In addition, we were able to take into account individual
level genome-wide genotype information of the children, in order
to reduce the influence of population structure and familial
relatedness. We predicted that, compared with those with
sufficient concentrations of 25OHD, those who were 25OHD
deficient (defined as o25 nmol l − 1) at either time point would
demonstrate more autism-related traits as indicated by higher SRS
scores.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The cohort
This study was embedded in the Generation R Study, a population-based
prospective cohort from fetal life onward, based in Rotterdam, The
Netherlands. The design and cohort of Generation R is extensively
described elsewhere.31,32 In brief, the study was designed to identify
environmental and genetic correlates of normal and abnormal health-
related outcomes in mothers and their children.
A total of 9778 mothers were enrolled in the study, of these mothers,
8878 (91%) enrolled during pregnancy. Delivery date of the pregnant
women was between April 2002 and January 2006. Cohort retention until
the age of 6 years, the age of SRS measurement, exceeded 80%.
Generation R is a multi-ethnic cohort with the Dutch comprising roughly
half of the sample. The ethnic background of the children was defined by
the parents’ country of birth, and further classified using definitions from
Statistics Netherland.33 If both parents were born abroad, the country of
birth of the mother was used to define the child’s ethnicity. The main non-
Dutch ethnic groups were Surinamese, Turkish, Moroccan and Cape
Verdian, which together accounted for almost 30% of the cohort. Written
informed consent was obtained from the mothers, and the study was
approved by the institutional review board of the Erasmus Medical Centre.
Vitamin D status
Vitamin
D
status
was
assessed
by
measuring
the
storage
form
25OHD.34
Samples
were
quantified
using
isotope
dilution
liquid
chromatography-tandem
mass
spectrometry.
The
analytical
system
consisted of a Shimadzu Nexera UPLC coupled to an AbSciex 5500
QTRAP equipped with an APCI source. Assay accuracy was assessed using
certified reference materials purchased from the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST SRM 972a Levels 1–4). Further details
of the assay methodology can be found in the Supplementary Material
(Supplementary Methods 2).
The prevalence and socio-demographic correlates of 25OHD concentra-
tions in the Generation R cohort have been described extensively
elsewhere.30 25OHD concentration was defined as the sum of 25-
hydroxyvitamin D2 (25OHD2) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3) species
measured in serum.35 25OHD was measured from prenatal and cord serum
in a total of 7935 expecting mothers and their children. The first sample
was taken at mid-gestation: “mean (s.d.) gestational age 20.6 (1.2) weeks,
range 18.1–24.9 weeks)”. The second sample was collected at birth, from
neonatal cord blood: “mean (s.d.) gestational age 40 (1.5) weeks, range
28.4–43.6 weeks)”.
The relationships between 25OHD concentrations and various health-
related outcomes can be non-linear.34 Although there is some debate
about the definition of deficiency and insufficiency with respect to
different
health
outcomes,36
there
is
widespread
agreement
that
concentrations lower than 25 nmol l − 1 can be defined as deficient (and
associated with increased risk of adverse health outcomes).8 In keeping
with recommendations for thresholds as defined by the Institute of
Medicine,34 we examined three stratified levels of 25OHD concentrations:
deficient (o25.0 nmol l − 1), insufficient (25–49.9 nmol l − 1) and sufficient
(50 nmol l − 1 or more). We also examined the association between 25OHD
concentrations when assessed as a continuous variable. Because the fetus
is entirely dependent on the maternal supply of vitamin D, and because of
the relatively long half-life of 25OHD (approximately 2 weeks), cord blood
assays serve as a proxy measure of late gestational vitamin D status (with
deficient cord levels suggesting a vitamin D-deficient environment during
late gestation).37,38 25OHD concentrations in maternal serum collected at
delivery and neonatal cord blood are highly correlated (r ~ 0.7).39–41
Social Responsiveness Scale
The SRS is a rating scale that measures the severity of autism-related
traits in the general population.29 For this study, parents of the
children filled out an 18-item abridged version of the questionnaire when
the children were ~ 6 years of age (mean age (s.d.) = 6.17 (0.48) years;
range: 4.89–8.90 years). Parents are asked to rate probes on a 4 point Likert
scale; 0 (not true); 1 (sometimes true); 2 (often true); and 3 (almost always
true). Prior to analyses, scores of the 18-item SRS were gender-weighted,
such that the recommended cutoffs for screening in population-based
settings were consistent with weighted scores of 1.078 for boys and 1.000
for girls. The cutoff for the 18-items SRS is based on the cutoff that is
suggested by the authors for the full 65 items SRS (that is, weighted by the
number of items.)29 The abridged version of the SRS focuses on
behavioural features related to social cognition, social communication
and autistic mannerisms. Social cognition reflects a child’s ability to
interpret social cues (example item ‘Is able to understand the meaning of
other people’s tone of voice and facial expressions’). Social communication
reflects expressive social communication (example SRS item: ‘Has trouble
keeping up with the flow of a normal interaction with other children’; ‘Talks
to people with an unusual tone of voice (for example, talks like a robot or
like he/she is giving a lecture’). Autistic mannerisms include stereotypical
behaviour or highly restricted interests characteristics of autism (example
SRS items: ‘Has repetitive odd behaviours such as hand flapping or
rocking’; ‘Has more difficulty than other children with changes in his/her
routine’). The complete 18-items SRS is provided in the Supplementary
Material. Statistical properties of the full SRS have been investigated in a
UK population sample of 500 children, aged 5–8 years.42 Construct validity
was found to be good when compared with the Repetitive Behaviours
Questionnaire 2, and the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire subscales.
Internal consistency was estimated for males and females separately
(Cronbach’s α males and females: 0.92). Correlations between the total
scores from the full SRS and the abridged version as used in the current
study range from 0.93 to 0.99.43,44 The SRS allows the exploration of
autism-related traits as a continuous measure with higher scores indicating
greater impairment in the domains of interest.
Ancestry and relatedness derived from observed common genetic
variants
Classifications related to ethnicity are often imprecise and contestable.45
Within the Generation R sample there is substantial ‘sample structure’
resulting from both geographic population stratification (that is, inclusion
of individuals from different populations) as well as from known and
hidden family-relatedness (for example, siblings, cousins and so on). We
have previously shown that (a) ethnicity is strongly associated with vitamin
D status,30 and (b) ethnicity is strongly (but imperfectly) associated
with principal components derived from common single-nucleotide
polymorphisms.46 Principal components are often included as covariates
in statistical models in order to adjust for ethnic differences; however these
do not capture all features of the underlying sample structure. Inadequate
adjustment for sample structure may lead to inflation of test statistics and
possibly spurious associations between the variables of interest. Recent
developments in statistical genetics have utilised genome-wide genotype
data to better model the effects of sample structure on a phenotype.47
Within the Generation R Cohort, genome-wide genotype data are available
for the children, thus utilising these data allows us to reduce the
imprecision of the important confounding ethnicity variable. DNA was
extracted from blood collected from the umbilical cord, or if this was not
available, from a blood sample that was obtained by venepuncture during
the child’s visit to the research centre at a mean age of 6 years. A detailed
description of the genotyping of the Generation R cohort is described
elsewhere.46,48 and details about genotyping and Quality Control that are
relevant to this study are provided in the Supplementary Material. Analyses
involving genome-wide genotype data in the current study were based on
3234 individuals on 518 245 single-nucleotide polymorphisms.
Statistical analyses
The sample sizes for different analyses vary between analyses related to
the availability of mid-gestational and cord 25OHD concentrations, SRS at
age 6 years, offspring genotype information and ethnicity. Note that twin
pregnancies and mothers with no follow-up after birth were removed prior
to analyses (see Supplementary Material Figure).
In order to optimise the sample size, we imputed a range of parental
and offspring variables that were included as covariates in the models.49

 Imputation was performed using the ‘Mix’ imputation package in R.50 ‘Mix’
uses an iterative multiple regression algorithm, which is Expectation–
Maximisation based and imputes mixed continuous and categorical data
under the general location model. Imputation expectancies were based on
covariates only and were independent of predictor variables (25OHD
concentrations) and outcome variable (SRS). Four out of eight variables
had missing data with missing proportions ranging from 3% (‘Educational
level of the mother’) to 10% (‘Mother smoking during pregnancy’).
Main analyses
Within a linear model framework, we first compared SRS scores between
those with (a) deficient versus sufficient and (b) insufficient versus
sufficient concentrations of vitamin D, for both mid-gestation and cord
blood. Parental and offspring variables were included as covariates in the
model. Second, we compared SRS scores between those who were
deficient at two time points (mid-gestation and cord blood) and those that
were not deficient at either time point and we compared SRS scores
between those that were deficient at one time point (mid-gestation or
cord blood) and those that were not deficient at either time point. Third,
we tested the association between continuous measures of vitamin D and
SRS. In addition, we tested whether vitamin D deficiency was predictive of
SRS when SRS was treated as a dichotomous outcome. In this analysis, the
outcome variable was high-SRS for those children with SRS scores above
the suggested gender-weighted cutoff and low-SRS for those with scores
below the cutoff.
Sensitivity and responder analyses
In addition to the main analyses, we undertook three planned sensitivity
analyses. First, we analysed only offspring with European ethnic back-
ground. Second, we replaced the ethnicity variable with a genetic
component
that
captures
both
population
stratification
and
family-relatedness and allows a test for association that is free from
confounding owing to sample structure. In this setting, we do not want to
adjust the analyses based on any particular single-nucleotide polymorph-
ism, but for an overall, genome-wide degree of relatedness. Third, we
adjusted the models for season of blood sampling to (a) correct for within-
year fluctuations in 25OHD concentrations and (b) to reduce the influence
of other (unobserved) seasonally fluctuating exposures. A detailed
description of the models is provided in the Supplementary Material,
including both a simplified ‘worked example’ and a detailed technical
description of the Genetic Relationship Matrix approach for dealing with
sample
structure.
In
our
prospective
population
cohort
we
have
missingness on socio-demographic variables, blood samples and SRS. We
compared SRS responders versus non-responders in order to explore the
impact of attrition/missingness on key socio-demographic variables.
RESULTS
Supplementary Figure 1 depicts a flow chart of the inclusion of
participants in this study. In total, 4229 children and their mothers
were available with measures of vitamin D concentrations drawn
from maternal blood at mid-gestation and/or drawn from cord
blood at time of birth as well as data on the SRS, 2489 children
and their mothers were available with measures of vitamin D
concentrations at both time points. Of the 4229 children in our
sample, 3169 of the children had individual level genotype data
available. Table 1 provides an overview of the distributions of
parental and offspring demographic variables in the study sample.
Supplementary Table 1 provides details of the distributions of the
demographic variables before and after imputation.

 Table 2 summarises the prevalence of 25OHD deficiency in mid-
gestation and cord blood for those samples for which SRS scores
were available. The proportion of the sample with deficiency was
substantial: 16% for maternal serum at mid-gestation and 36% for
cord blood. On average, 25OHD concentrations from cord blood
were lower compared with concentrations at mid-gestation (mean
25OHD
concentration

serum
at
mid-gestation:
58.9 nmol l − 1;
mean
25OHD
concentration
in
cord
blood:
35.9 nmol l − 1; t = 35.8, Po001).
Vitamin D and SRS scores
Scores on the SRS were available for 4229 children. The data were
right skewed and in order to improve the distribution of the
outcome variable, values for the SRS were ‘winsorized’ (that is,
extreme outlier scores were recoded to improve distribution).
Scores higher than 1.5 (corresponding with ~ 5 s.d.s above the
mean, n = 21 children) were set to equal 1.5. Supplementary
Figure 2 depicts the distributions of the raw SRS scores and the
gender-weighted and winsorized SRS scores. Mean gender-
weighted scores (s.d., range) of the SRS was 0.23 units (0.23,
0–1.5) and median (interquartile range) of 0.17 (0.06, 0.29). Mean
SRS (s.d.) for individuals vitamin D deficient, insufficient and
sufficient at mid-gestation was: 0.32 (0.28), 0.24 (0.24) and 0.20
(0.20), respectively. Mean SRS (s.d.) for individuals vitamin D
deficient, insufficient and sufficient based on cord blood was: 0.27
(0.25), 0.21 (0.22) and 0.19 (0.20), respectively. Supplementary
Table 3 also provides an overview of the SRS scores for different
vitamin D deficiency categories.
Table 3 shows the results of the main analyses for the SRS
(including ethnicity as a covariate). In all analyses, 25OHD
deficiency or lower 25OHD concentrations were associated with
higher (more impaired) SRS scores. Compared with those who
were sufficient, those who were deficient at mid-gestation or
deficient at time of birth were significantly more likely to have
higher SRS scores (mid-gestation: β = 0.06, s.e. = 0.01, Po0.001;
cord: β = 0.03, s.e. = 0.01, P = 0.01). Moreover, compared with those
who were sufficient at mid-gestation, those who were insufficient
were also significantly more likely to have higher SRS scores
(β = 0.02, s.e. = 0.01, P = 0.007) (see Table 3A). These results imply
that, after correcting for confounding variables (see notes under
Table 3), those who were deficient at time of birth had on average
0.06 point higher gender-weighted SRS score, which corresponds
to an increase of approximately one fourth of the s.d. (s.d. of the
SRS
in
the
total
sample = 0.23).
When
treating
SRS
as
a
dichotomous outcome, that is, comparing children with SRS
scores above the suggested cutoff with children below the
suggested cutoff, those who were vitamin D deficient at mid-
gestation were 3.8 times more likely to be screened positive than
those who were vitamin D sufficient at mid-gestation (see also
Supplementary Table 4).

 The comparison of SRS scores of those that were deficient at
two time points (mid-gestation and cord blood) versus those that
were not deficient at either time point showed that being 25OHD
deficient at both time points was predictive of higher SRS scores.
Having 25OHD deficiency at only one time point (mid-gestation or
cord blood) did not predict SRS scores (Table 3B). When we
treated
25OHD
concentrations

variables

observed a significant increase in SRS scores with decreasing
concentrations of 25OHD for both mid-gestation and cord
samples, that is, a similar pattern as observed in the association
between vitamin D deficiency categories and SRS (Table 3C).
Sensitivity and responder analyses
In the analyses restricted to offspring with European ethnicity, we
found that the pattern of findings persisted with significant
increase in SRS scores for those deficient versus sufficient (both
Midgestion and Cord) and for those insufficient vs sufficient (mid-
gestation) (Supplementary Table 5). Similarly, when we replaced
ethnicity
with
the
genetic
component
that
captures
both
population stratification and family-relatedness, the pattern of
findings identified in the main analyses persisted, suggesting that
the observed association was free from confounding with
ethnicity (Supplementary Table 6). The results persisted after
adjusting the models for season of blood sampling (that is, season
at mid-gestation or at time of birth for respective analyses). Results
shown in Supplementary Table 7. Those who dropped out, or had
missing data for the predictor and/or outcome variable, were more
likely to have the follow characteristics; (a) non-European, (b) less well
educated, (c) smoked during the pregnancy, (c) younger parental age
and (d) shorter gestational age. There was no significant difference in
the gender of the child (Supplementary Table 8).
DISCUSSION
In our population-based cohort study sample of 4229 children, we
show that gestational vitamin D deficiency was associated with
higher scores on the SRS. We report for we believe the first time
an association between mid-gestational 25OHD deficiency and
variation in a widely used, continuous measure of autism-related
traits in the general population. The pattern of findings persisted
when we restricted the analyses to the offspring of European
ethnicity and when we accounted for sample structure using
individual level genetic data of the offspring. These analyses
strongly reduce the chance that our main analyses were
confounded by ethnic diversity within the sample.
When we examined the two time-point measures of vitamin D
deficiency we found only mother–infant pairs with deficiency at
both time points had higher scores on the SRS. This finding
suggests that infants exposed to persistent low vitamin D from
mid-gestation until birth may be at risk for autism-related traits,
whereas this was not identified in those with deficiency at only
one time point. In light of the (a) significant relationship between
25OHD when assessed as a continuous variable versus SRS, and (b)
the significant relationship between both mid-gestation deficient
and insufficient 25OHD concentration versus SRS, we speculate
that the exposure may operate as a continuous graded risk factor,
without a critical threshold. Our study, based on a large,
population-based, multi-ethnic cohort, was well suited to test
our hypotheses. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was high
(16% of the mothers had mid-gestational 25OHD concentrations
o25 nmol l − 1; based on cord blood, the prevalence of vitamin D
deficiency was 36%).
Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that, in humans, is obtained
from exposure to sunlight and, to a lesser extent, from diet.8 The
active form of vitamin D (1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D) binds to the
vitamin D receptor, which is a member of a phylogenetically
conserved superfamily of nuclear receptors. Several other ligands
operating via nuclear receptors are known to be important in
brain development (for example, retinoic acid, glucocorticoids,
thyroid hormone, sex hormones). Both the vitamin D receptor and
the rate-limiting enzyme required for the production of 1,25
dihydroxyvitamin D, are expressed in neurons and glial cells in the
brain.51 The findings from the current study lends weight to the
growing body of research linking gestational vitamin D deficiency
and altered brain development. Rodent models based on transient
prenatal exposure to vitamin D deficiency have found a range of
persistent molecular (gene and protein expression), neurochem-
ical and behavioural changes of interest to neuropsychiatry.52
Neonatal vitamin D deficiency has been previously associated with
an increased risk of schizophrenia,53 and ASD and schizophrenia
are known to share genetic risk variants.54 Our findings provide
additional evidence of the shared risk architecture between these
two neurodevelopmental disorders. These convergent clues may
provide insights into the etiopathogenesis of neurodevelopmental
disorders. For example, the active form of vitamin D (1,25
dihydoxyvitamin D) is known to impact on the function of
voltage-gated calcium channels.55,56 Variants in genes coding
for subunits of these same calcium channels (for example,
CACNA1C) have been linked to risk of both schizophrenia and
ASD.57,58 In addition, vitamin D has been linked to other
neurobiological features associated with autism.14,59 For example,
1,25 dihydoxyvitamin D has been shown to influence the
expression of tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (a key enzyme in the
production of serotonin).60 Mice exposed to adult vitamin
D-deficient diets had altered behaviour (that is, hyperlocomotion
in a novel open field) and a significant reduction in the key
enzyme involved in the key synthesising enzymes for GABA,
glutamic acid decarboxylase type 65 and 67 (GAD65, GAD67).61
Reductions in the expression of GAD65/67 has been previously
reported in post-mortem studies of ASD.62,63
With respect to study limitations, although we had measures of
25OHD concentrations at two developmental time points, we
lacked information at other stages of gestation and early life.
Defining the precise critical window during which developmental
vitamin D deficiency adversely impacts on brain development
would be premature. Differential attrition is known to impact on
the representativeness of modern birth cohorts. Several of the
variables associated with non-responder status in our study are
associated with either low vitamin D (for example, non-European
ethnicity, smoking),30 and/or risk of autism-related outcomes (for
example, lower gestational age).64 In the presence of a true
association between gestational vitamin D deficiency and higher
SRS scores, this differential pattern of nonresponse would bias the
sample toward the null hypothesis (it is therefore unlikely that the
observed responder bias could account for our significant
findings). It should also be noted that we do not believe that
low gestational 25OHD concentration is solely linked to higher
scores on the SRS (that is, specificity between the exposure and
the outcome). There is evidence linking low prenatal vitamin D
status with increased risk of other neurodevelopmental disorders
such as schizophrenia13 and attention deficit and hyperactivity
disorder.65 Although the SRS is well suited to assess autism-related
traits, poor communication can also be associated with a range of
other childhood disorders.66,67 Findings based on observational
epidemiology are susceptible to residual confounding and it is
feasible that vitamin D status could serve as a proxy marker for
other (unobserved) risk-modifying factors linked to SRS scores.
Randomised controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation during
pregnancy will be needed in order to confidently link vitamin D
and an increased risk of autism-related conditions. In light of the
evidence linking prenatal vitamin D with general growth and bone
health68–70 such trials should be designed with several primary
outcomes. In our data, we observe a more pronounced association
for those who were deficient at two time points (that is,
mid-gestation and at time of birth) compared with deficiency at

 only one time point. We also detected an association between the
continuous measure of vitamin D concentrations and autism-
related traits, letting us hypothesise that vitamin D is operating as
a continuous grade risk factor without a critical threshold.
Randomised controlled trials will be required to test this
hypothesis.
Future research should focus on specificity of the effect of early
life vitamin D deficiency in relation to neurodevelopmental
disorders. Alongside animal studies that aim to elucidate the
biological mechanisms linking vitamin D deficiency and brain
development, human studies could focus on endophenotypes to
better understand the pathway from vitamin D deficiency to
various neurodevelopmental disorders (for example, structural
and functional magnetic resonance imaging44,71).
This study has several important strengths. Our sample was
based on a large representative multi-ethnic cohort. We used a
gold standard assessment of 25OHD concentrations, and a widely
used measure of autism-related traits. We had access to infant
genotypes and were able to explore innovative models that can
more precisely adjust for ancestral differences and family-
relatedness in the cohort.
Our findings require replication in independent samples. We are
aware of several case–control studies currently underway that will
examine the association between neonatal 25OHD and ASD.
Ideally, future studies should examine additional time points
during gestation, as well as cord/neonatal samples, as it remains
to be determined whether gestational and early life vitamin D
status has a ‘critical window’ when the brain is differentially
sensitive to this exposure.
CONCLUSIONS
25OHD deficiency assessed either at mid-gestation or at birth was
associated with an increase in autism-related traits in 6-year-old
children. The association between developmental vitamin D
deficiency and autism-related traits may have important implica-
tions from a public health perspective. It is feasible that a safe,
cheap and publicly accessible vitamin D supplement in at-risk
groups may reduce the prevalence of this risk factor. Just as
prenatal folate supplementation has reduced the incidence of
spina bifida, we speculate that prenatal vitamin D supplementa-
tion may reduce the incidence of ASD.
