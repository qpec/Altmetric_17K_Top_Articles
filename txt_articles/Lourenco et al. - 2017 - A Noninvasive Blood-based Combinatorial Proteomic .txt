Abstract
To improve breast cancer diagnosis, 2 prospective clinical trials were conducted to test (n [ 351) and validate
(n [ 210) Videssa Breast. If used in conjunction with imaging, Videssa Breast could have reduced unnecessary
biopsies by up to 67%. These results support the joint use of breast imaging and Videssa Breast to better
inform clinical decisions for women under age 50.
Background: Despite significant advances in breast imaging, the ability to detect breast cancer (BC) remains a
challenge. To address the unmet needs of the current BC detection paradigm, 2 prospective clinical trials were
conducted to develop a blood-based combinatorial proteomic biomarker assay (Videssa Breast) to accurately detect
BC and reduce false positives (FPs) from suspicious imaging findings. Patients and Methods: Provista-001 and
Provista-002 (cohort one) enrolled Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System 3 or 4 women aged under 50 years.
Serum was evaluated for 11 serum protein biomarkers and 33 tumor-associated autoantibodies. Individual biomarker
expression, demographics, and clinical characteristics data from Provista-001 were combined to develop a logistic
regression model to detect BC. The performance was tested using Provista-002 cohort one (validation set). Results:
The training model had a sensitivity and specificity of 92.3% and 85.3% (BC prevalence, 7.7%), respectively. In the
validation set (BC prevalence, 2.9%), the sensitivity and specificity were 66.7% and 81.5%, respectively. The negative
predictive value was high in both sets (99.3% and 98.8%, respectively). Videssa Breast performance in the combined
training and validation set was 99.1% negative predictive value, 87.5% sensitivity, 83.8% specificity, and 25.2%
positive predictive value (BC prevalence, 5.87%). Overall, imaging resulted in 341 participants receiving follow-up
procedures to detect 30 cancers (90.6% FP rate). Videssa Breast would have recommended 111 participants for
follow-up, a 67% reduction in FPs (P < .00001). Conclusions: Videssa Breast can effectively detect BC when used in
conjunction with imaging and can substantially reduce unnecessary medical procedures, as well as provide assurance
to women that they likely do not have BC.

 Introduction
Breast cancer (BC) is predicted to be the second leading cause of
cancer deaths in women in the United States; approximately
232,000 cases of invasive BC and 60,000 cases of ductal carcinoma
in situ (DCIS) are diagnosed and 40,000 deaths occur annually.1
However, if diagnosed early in a localized state, 5-year survival
rates are > 98%.2
Imaging (including mammography, ultrasound [US], magnetic
resonance imaging [MRI], and 3-D tomosynthesis) is the gold
standard for BC detection. It has been suggested that imaging
ambiguity could be mitigated by the combination of a proteomic
assay.3 When imaging results are questionable (eg, Breast Imaging-
Reporting and Data System [BI-RADS] categories 3 or 4), National
Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend that BI-
RADS 3 patients are followed with reimaging at 6 months, and
BI-RADS 4 patients are recommended for biopsy.4 Confounding
factors (eg, breast density, prior biopsy, and lesion size) may limit
the effectiveness of imaging.5-7 Women with high breast density
have a greater incidence of BC compared with women with low
density.5,8 Despite recent advances in imaging, the rates of false
positives (FPs) and false negatives (FNs) represent a significant
problem in the early diagnosis of BC.9-12 The sensitivities and
specificities of various imaging modalities and/or their various
combinations widely range from 50% upwards.13-17 A compre-
hensive study by Berg et al evaluated the supplemental cancer
detection yield of US or MRI, when used in addition to
mammography, in a large cohort of women (n ¼ 2809; 21 sites) at
elevated risk for BC.15 In this study, sensitivity ranged from 52%
upwards and specificity ranged from 65% upwards, depending on
the imaging modality used. The addition of screening US or MRI to
mammography resulted in more cancers being detected, but there
was also an increase in the number of FPs.15
In recent years, the role of protein biomarkers in the detection of
BC has undergone a major shift from investigational use to evalu-
ation of prognostic value for a given BC subtype.11 With the dis-
covery of key protein biomarkers and protein signatures for BC,
proteomic technologies are currently poised to serve as an ideal
diagnostic adjunct to imaging.3,18 Previous research studies have
shown that breast tumors are associated with systemic changes in
both serum protein biomarkers (SPBs) and tumor-associated auto-
antibodies (TAAbs).19-27 A very limited number of protein bio-
markers, such as the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor,
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, cancer-associated anti-
gens (CA27.29 and CA15-3), and carcinoembryonic antigen are
currently used for prognosis and treatment monitoring, but their
utility in detecting early BC has not been confirmed.28,29 In

 addition, several studies have demonstrated the potential use of a
new set of protein biomarkers, TAAbs, in early BC detection.30,31
Given the complexity and heterogeneity of BC, the use of indi-
vidual protein biomarkers has lacked sensitivity and specificity; a
combinatorial biomarker approach may be warranted to ensure the
greatest success in detecting BC.3
Therefore, to address the unmet needs of the current BC
detection paradigm in patients under the age of 50 years assessed as
BI-RADS 3 or 4, the aim of this study was to develop a combi-
natorial proteomic biomarker assay comprised of SPBs and TAAbs,
integrated with patient-specific clinical data, to produce a diagnostic
score that could reliably detect BC following suspicious imaging
findings.
Patients and Methods
Study Design and Participants
Provista-001 (Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01839045) and Provista-
002 (cohort one; Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02078570), which were
sponsored by Provista Diagnostics, enrolled women assessed as
either a BI-RADS 3 or 4 at the time of enrollment. All imaging
modalities, such as mammography, 3-D tomosynthesis, US, and
MRI (and any combination of these modalities) were permitted for
the assessment of BI-RADS. Participants were enrolled across 13
domestic clinical sites (See Supplemental Table 1 in the online
version), and the study was institutional review board-approved.
Informed consent was obtained from all study participants prior
to enrollment and sample collection. Blood samples were collected
post-imaging and pre-biopsy for all patients enrolled in this study to
minimize any potential collection-associated variation. Participants
who were not diagnosed with BC were followed for 6 months for
additional clinical outcomes, which were assessed via additional
imaging and/or pathology results.
Videssa Breast results were not shared with clinicians during the
trials to ensure that clinical decision-making was unaffected. An
overview of the study design is provided in Figure 1, and the clinical
management workflow is summarized in Figure 2. The study was
designed by an external subject-matter expert and the authors, and a
third-party Contract Research Organization collected and moni-
tored data.
Study Objective
The aim of this study was to develop a blood-based diagnostic
test to detect BC for use in conjunction with imaging to aid
healthcare providers in making informed decisions on treating
young women (under 50 years of age) with difficult-to-assess im-
aging findings.
Measurement of SPBs and TAAbs
Serum was evaluated for the concentrations of 11 SPBs and for
the relative presence/absence of 33 TAAbs (See Supplemental
Table 2 in the online version). Following informed consent and
prior to biopsy, 5 tubes of blood were collected in a Vacutainer clot
tube. Blood was allowed to coagulate for 30 minutes at room
temperature, then placed in a centrifuge and spun at 1100� g for 10

 to 15 minutes. Immediately after centrifugation, a series of aliquots
were transferred into 5-mL cryovials, depending on serum yield.
Tubes were labeled with a specimen ID number and date, then
frozen prior to shipping. Samples were batched and shipped by the
site to Provista’s laboratory. Upon receipt by Provista, cryovials were
accessioned and placed immediately into �80�C for storage.
SPB concentrations were determined using modified electro-
chemiluminescent-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits,
following manufacturer’s specifications (Meso Scale Discovery,
Rockville, MD).32 Each SPB plate contained 6 vendor-provided
standards (in duplicate) to generate a standard curve. TAAbs were
detected using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,
which includes binding purified recombinant proteins to standard-
bind plates (Meso Scale Discovery). Proteins were diluted in 1 �
phosphate-buffered saline and coated onto blank plates at a final
concentration of 20 ng/well. All recombinant proteins, certified as
> 80% pure (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electro-
phoresis), were purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD) or Abnova
(Taiwan). Origene proteins were myc/DDK peptide-tagged and
produced in HEK293 cells. Abnova proteins were glutathione
S-transferase-tagged and produced in wheat germ cells.
All samples were processed in duplicate both for SPBs and
TAAbs, and mean values were used for data analysis. Appropriate
controls (samples with known values, standards, and blanks) were
included on each plate to monitor the performance of both assays.
SPB concentrations were calculated by processing sample and
standard data with the Meso Scale Discovery Workbench 4.0
software using a weighted, 4-parameter, logistic-fit (FourPL) algo-
rithm. TAAb ratio values were determined using the following
calculation, using normalization parameters modified from Ander-
son et al33:

where Target MFI ¼ mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of

of

Statistical Analysis
Using the Provista-001 dataset only (Figure 1), training models
to predict the presence or absence of BC were developed using the
individual biomarkers (ie, SPBs and TAAbs). Owing to expectedly
weak univariate associations between individual biomarkers based
on previous studies,34,35 additional training models with and
without participant’s specific clinical data were built iteratively by
altering SPB and TAAb features. Multivariable models were built
using forward and backward selection methods and varying the
alpha for inclusion in (or exclusion from) a model to identify a
subset of predictors that consistently presented. These multivariable
models were optimized by adding and subtracting additional
markers iteratively, until a final model was created that met mini-
mum performance criteria. The area under the receiver operating
characteristic was used to determine model performance in regards
to sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and
negative predictive value (NPV); Table 1 provides definitions for
these terms. Confidence intervals were reported as 2-sided binomial
95% confidence intervals.
A logistic regression model, which included participant age, was
created to combine a panel of transitions that were modeled to
calculate a diagnostic score (Ds) between 0 and 1 for each sample, as
follows:
where Ds is diagnostic score, a is intercept, b1 is coefficient for age,
bi is the coefficient for SPB, and bj is the coefficient for TAAb.
Samples with Ds equal to or greater than the reference value (cutoff)
were considered clinically positive (BC), and samples that were less
than the reference value were clinically negative (benign).
This training model was tested using the validation set, Provista-
002 cohort one (Figure 1). This model was then applied to the
combined training (Provista-001) and validation (Provista-002) sets
to evaluate its performance in a larger dataset.
Participant characteristics were summarized with medians and
inter-quartile ranges for numerical data, or sums and percentages for
categorical data. To determine balance between sets, Wilcoxon rank-
sum tests were used for continuous variables and c2 tests or Fisher

Results
Study Population
The Provista-001 study enrolled 351 women under the age of 50
years at 8 sites (See Supplemental Table 1 in the online version)
across the United States, who were assessed as either BI-RADS
category 3 or 4 at the time of enrollment. Blood samples were
collected post-imaging and pre-biopsy for all patients enrolled in
this study to minimize any potential collection-associated variation
(Figure 2). Of the 351 participants enrolled, samples collected from
12 participants had to be excluded from analysis (Figure 1),
resulting
in 339
participants
being
analyzed
for biomarker
expression (Table 2). Of these 339 participants, 313 were diagnosed
with a benign breast condition, either by biopsy during the initial
visit or by additional imaging performed at the 6-month follow-up.
Twenty-six participants were diagnosed as having invasive BC (18)
or DCIS (8); thus, cancer incidence was 7.7% in Provista-001 (26/
339) (Table 2). Of these, 24 participants were diagnosed at the
primary visit, and an additional 2 participants were diagnosed
during the 6-month follow-up visit.
The Provista-002 study enrolled 210 women under the age of 50
years at 10 sites (See Supplemental Table 1 in the online version), of
which 5 overlapped with the Provista-001 study, across the United
States who were assessed as either BI-RADS category 3 or 4 at the
time of enrollment. Of the 210 participants enrolled, samples
collected from 4 participants were excluded from analysis (Figure 1),

 leaving 206 participants that could be analyzed for biomarker
expression (Table 2). Of these 206 participants, there were 200
diagnosed with a benign breast condition, either by biopsy during
the initial visit or by additional imaging performed at the 6-month
follow-up visit. Six participants were diagnosed as having BC: BC
(2) or DCIS (4). Thus, cancer incidence was 2.9% in the Provista-
002 cohort one dataset (6/206) (Table 2). Of these, all participants
were diagnosed at the primary visit, and no additional BC cases were
diagnosed during the 6-month follow-up visit.
Serum samples were collected post-BI-RADS assessment but
prior to biopsy (Figure 2). Samples were evaluated for SPB and
TAAb expression as described in the Methods section, and these
biomarker expression data were used for Videssa Breast model
development.
Videssa Breast Model Development
Previously published results34 suggested several SPBs (eg, OPN,
FASL, TNF-a, carcinoembryonic antigen, IL12, HGF, and
VEGFD) and TAAbs (eg, FRS3, RAC3, HOXD1, GPR157,
ZMYM6, EIF3E, CSNK1E, ZNF510, BMX, SF3A1, and SOX2)
that demonstrated a modest ability to distinguish benign from BC
patients. Thus, models were developed using these preselected
biomarkers23,34 (See Supplemental Table 2 in the online version).
These preselected markers were univariately evaluated in benign and
BC populations; representative box-plots using both age- and BI-
RADS-matched samples are provided in Supplemental Figure 1
(in the online version). Because this preselected group of markers
was developed utilizing retrospectively collected specimens from 1
group of patients from a single clinical site,24,34 the inclusion of
additional markers was predicted to improve the detection of BC.
Additionally, as the prospective cohorts described in this study only
included patients with BI-RADS category 3 and 4 diagnoses, these
samples represent an intended-use population different than previ-
ous studies, which included additional BI-RADS groups 0, 1, 2, 3,
4, and 5 and was not limited to patients aged under 50. The
collection of samples from a separate intended-use population
further added to the rationale of altering markers to model
development.
To develop models that could detect the presence or absence of
BC in women under the age of 50 years scored as BI-RADS cate-
gory 3 or 4, a multi-step process was utilized, whereby biomarker
expression and clinical characteristics of the Provista-001 partici-
pants
(n
¼
339)
were
analyzed
using
logistic
regression
modeling,36,37 as described in the Methods.
Several training models to detect BC were assessed using different
protein biomarker combinations (SPBs and TAAbs) with and
without demographics and clinical characteristics, such as age, race,
family history, and smoking status (multiple other characteristics
were tested but did not show significant differences). Models
involving either SPBs or TAAbs alone did not provide statistically
significant results (See Supplemental Figure 2 in the online version).
The SPB model alone (6 markers) demonstrated high sensitivity
(88.5%) and the TAAb model alone (10 markers) demonstrated
high specificity (82.5%); these findings confirmed our previous
results34; therefore, we deduced that combining SPB and TAAb
biomarkers would result in a model with higher specificity and
higher sensitivity than either biomarker type alone. Starting with
our retrospective model,34 combinatorial training models were built

 using both forward and backward selection methods to identify a
subset of markers that consistently entered models at various alphas.
We then iteratively included or excluded SPB (11) and TAAb (33)
markers to optimize sensitivity and specificity while being as
parsimonious as possible. No other participant demographic data,
except for age, improved the model performance.
The training model consisted of 18 protein biomarkers (8 SPBs
and 10 TAAbs) identified from the original set of biomarkers
evaluated in this study (See Supplemental Table 2 in the online
version). The performance of this model in the training dataset
(Provista-001; n ¼ 339) was 92.3% for sensitivity, 85.3% for
specificity, 99.3% for NPV, and 34.3% for PPV (Figure 3).
Provista-002 (cohort one; n ¼ 206) used an independent vali-
dation set. The training model was locked (ie, biomarker compo-
sition, coefficient values, and cut-off point used to detect the
presence or absence of cancer) before clinical outcome data for the
validation set (Provista-002 cohort one) was received from the
blinded data broker. The training model developed using the
training set (n ¼ 339) was applied to the validation set (n ¼ 206) to
detect BC. A summary of the performance data is provided in
Figure 3. The performance of Videssa Breast, when prospectively
applied to the validation set (Provista-002 cohort one; n ¼ 206),
demonstrated a 66.7% sensitivity, 81.5% specificity, 98.8% NPV,
and 9.8% PPV (Figure 3). NPV and specificity are measures of the
number of true negative cases within a population. The NPV
(98.8%) for Videssa Breast remained extremely high for the vali-
dation cohort, which was comparable with the NPV observed for
the training set (99.3%; P ¼ .3023). The same is true for specificity,
which decreased only slightly in the validation cohort (85.3% in
training and 81.3% in validation; P ¼ .24459).
All benign cases were included in both the training and validation
sets, regardless of whether the subject received a biopsy. Of the
benign samples collected for this study, 43% were presumed to be
benign (ie, no pathologic confirmation by biopsy) (Figure 2), and
this included both BI-RADS category 3 and 4 subjects, irrespective
of National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, which
recommend that BI-RADS 3 patients are followed with reimaging at
6 months, whereas BI-RADS 4 patients are recommended for bi-
opsy.4 Following model development, performance was specifically
evaluated in the confirmed benign (ie, by biopsy) (Figure 2) and BC
subgroups (See Supplemental Table 3 in the online version).
Sensitivity was unaffected and specificity was increased in both
training and validation sets, which could be because of the reduction
in FPs (Compare Figure 1 with Supplemental Table 3 [in the online
version]). NPV slightly decreased (P ¼ .82287) and PPV increased
(P ¼ .00101) in this subset analysis. These results demonstrate
consistent model performance within the intended-use population
(where the subject may not undergo biopsy), as well as in the
clinically confirmed population (Figure 2).
Owing to low cancer prevalence, both the training (Provista-001)
and validation (Provista-002) data sets were combined to assess
overall Videssa Breast performance (combined BC prevalence,
5.87%). Videssa Breast correctly diagnosed 28 of the 32 participants
with BC (See Supplemental Table 4 in the online version), with a
NPV of 99.1%, sensitivity of 87.5%, specificity of 83.8%, PPV of
25.2%, and an area under the curve of 0.8477 (Figure 3). Because
of the higher BC prevalence in the training set, it is possible that the
sensitivity may suffer from optimism bias; however, specificity and
NPV were not impacted. Of note, there were 2 cases that Videssa
Breast identified as being positive at enrollment (Sample number
6043 [Figure 4, upper panel] and Sample number 5007 [See
Supplemental Table 4 in the online version]), and these cases were
not recommended for biopsy after imaging. Subsequent imaging at
follow-up recommended these cases for biopsy, and biopsy subse-
quently confirmed that cancer was present. Thus, Videssa Breast
may provide additional diagnostic power to detect early cases of BC.
Detailed timelines for 2 subjects are shown in Figure 4. Subject
6043 was assessed as BI-RADS 3 on initial visit, and no biopsy was

 performed. At the 6-month follow-up visit, the subject was assessed
as BI-RADS 4, and a subsequent biopsy revealed a high-grade
DCIS. Videssa Breast was run on serum drawn at the initial visit
and at the 6-month follow-up visit. Both samples resulted in a
positive Videssa Breast test result, indicating that this test had
correctly identified the subject as likely having BC at the initial visit,
when standard assessments failed to detect the presence of BC.
Another case, Subject 2004, was assessed as BI-RADS 4 at the initial
visit; this subject’s Videssa Breast test result was positive. The
subject’s biopsy revealed a low-grade DCIS; however, an additional
biopsy 14 days later revealed a grade 2 BC, indicating that both
imaging and Videssa Breast correctly identified the subject as likely
having breast adenocarcinoma. Indeed, in this study, when imaging
and Videssa concord, 100% detection was observed at the earliest
stage.
Comparison of Videssa Breast to Imaging-Based
Assessment on Medical Procedure Rate
The imaging modalities used to diagnose BC in participants
enrolled in this clinical trial included diagnostic mammogram, US,
diagnostic mammogram combined with US, tomosynthesis, and/or
MRI. The FP rate (defined as the identification of a benign breast
condition by biopsy) of imaging at enrollment was compared with
the potential FP rate for Videssa Breast (Table 3). Imaging
contributed to 339 participants receiving procedures and detected
30 cancers at enrollment, resulting in 309 FPs (91% FP rate). If
Videssa Breast had been used in assessment at the time of enroll-
ment, it would have recommended 111 participants receive pro-
cedures, of which 83 would have resulted in a FP (75% FP rate).
These data suggest that Videssa Breast, when used in conjunction
with imaging, can reduce unnecessary biopsies by up to 67% (P �
.00001) compared with imaging modalities alone.
Discussion
In women with questionable or equivocal imaging findings, it is
often difficult to determine whether to proceed with biopsy, further
image, or reassess at a later time. Of particular concern is the high
FP rate associated with BI-RADS 3 or 4 patients, who are either
followed
with
repeat
imaging
assessment
at
6
months
or
recommended for biopsy, respectively. The economic impact of FPs
is multiplicative owing to the cascade of follow-up diagnostic pro-
cedures, such as additional imaging/biopsy, resulting in cumber-
some and costly follow-ups. In addition, these follow-up procedures
may impact the quality of life for the patient (eg, missing work and
family time). Furthermore, scar tissue remaining from biopsy can
pose additional complications for future imaging. Perhaps more
importantly, the anxiety and negative impact of a positive diagnosis
(false or not) on the quality of life for patients is significant and may
impact further compliance. Thus, there is a clear need for a diag-
nostic test that reduces FPs and provides a tool for clinicians to
confirm negative findings.
Based on previously published studies suggesting the clinical
value of SPBs and TAAbs,3 we conducted a prospective study to
determine if the diagnosis of BC could be improved through the
complementary use of a combinational proteomic biomarker assay
with imaging. Videssa Breast was successfully developed and vali-
dated by combining 8 SPBs and 10 TAAbs with participants’ de-
mographic and clinical data; the NPV was 98.8%, sensitivity was
66.7%, specificity was 81.5%, and PPV was 9.8% in the validation
set.
We note a decrease in clinical sensitivity between the training and
validation sets. Although possibly because of over-fitting of the
training model, we feel the bulk of the reduction in Videssa Breast
sensitivity in the validation cohort is likely owing to the marked
reduced BC prevalence in the Provista-002 cohort as compared with
the training set (7.7% vs. 2.9% for Provista-001 and Provista-002,
respectively) (Table 2). This reduction may be because of changes in
imaging assessments (as a means of decreasing imaging-related FN
rates) as this has now been observed in greater than 1350 patients
enrolled in Provista’s prospective clinical trials over a period of 3
years. Other large studies have also seen a decrease in BI-RADS
category 3 use and have witnessed increased BI-RADS category 4
assessment, likely owing to medicolegal considerations. Because
sensitivity and PPV were impacted, whereas specificity and NPV
were not, it is likely that the decrease in sensitivity and PPV were
attributed to low BC prevalence and not over-fitting.
Of the 32 cancers detected by imaging, 2 patients were not
recommended for follow-up procedures at enrollment, whereas

 Videssa Breast would have recommended these patients for follow-
up. Administration of Videssa Breast would have significantly
reduced the number of participants receiving procedures prescribed
by imaging by 67% (P < .0001). Thus, based on these data, Videssa
Breast can reduce the number of medical procedures for low- or
intermediate-risk BC patients under the age of 50. Conversely, if
patients demonstrate positive Videssa Breast results or if additional
imaging suggests the presence of BC, further monitoring or biopsy
may be warranted.
A significant limitation of this study is that the confirmation of
BC through biopsy is subject to sampling bias. A patient can be
diagnosed with BC only if the biopsy comes from a region of the
breast that includes cells with abnormal lesions. If a biopsy is not
performed or is performed in a location absent of neoplasm, BC
could be incorrectly diagnosed as a benign breast condition. For
example, one of the participants in this study, Subject 1021, was
assessed as BI-RADS 4 at the initial visit and underwent a cyst
aspiration. Videssa Breast testing on both the initial serum sample
and the 6-month follow-up serum sample revealed high levels of
p53 TAAb, which is highly indicative of cancer based on previous
literature.38 Upon further review of the patient’s medical history, it
was noted that this participant had 2 second-degree relatives and 1
first-degree relative diagnosed with BC. There is the possibility that
this participant had early BC at the initial visit. When patients have
both a positive protein signature for Videssa Breast and a family
history of BC, this may warrant additional monitoring—thus,
Videssa Breast appears to have utility in aiding physicians to more
effectively manage these patients.
Another limitation of this study is that patients were followed for
6 months rather than a 12-month follow-up. A 6-month follow-up
period may not be sufficient to identify all cancers in BI-RADS 3
and 4 patients; an additional 12-month follow-up may have yielded
an increased cancer incidence. Therefore, it is possible that a subset
of the Videssa Breast FPs are pre-clinical BCs that have yet to be
detected. This study also relied on multiple imaging modalities to
detect BC. The differential diagnostic methodologies used for pa-
tients in this clinical trial may have impacted the performance of
Videssa Breast, as these methodologies widely vary in their sensi-
tivity and specificity.15
An additional study limitation is the BC prevalence in the Provista-
002 cohort one set. Whereas a BC prevalence of 20% was expected
based on literature,39 the actual prevalence was 7.7% for Videssa
Breast in Provista-001 (training set) and 2.9% for Provista-002
cohort one (validation set). Despite a reduction in sensitivity for
the validation set (likely owing to the reduction in BC prevalence
from 7.7% to 2.9% for the training and validations sets, respectively),
Videssa Breast continued to demonstrate specificity (81.5%) and
NPV (99.1%) in this independent validation set. These data provide
quantifiable metrics supporting that Videssa Breast can reduce diag-
nostic uncertainty for providers, based on Videssa Breast specificity,
and provide assurance to patients, based on Videssa Breast NPV, that
they do not have BC. Thus, Videssa Breast could ultimately reduce
the number of unnecessary medical procedures (ie, follow-up imaging
and biopsies) and alleviate the stress of not knowing whether an
abnormal imaging finding is a BC. Additional studies are being
conducted to determine how to best maximize sensitivity (an optimal
model for biopsy rule-out) and potential medical cost-savings asso-
ciated with Videssa Breast in women over age 50.
Conclusion
In summary, this study describes the development of an inno-
vative, noninvasive, actionable tool to detect BC in women under
the age of 50. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study of
a proteomic panel (composed of SPBs and TAAbs) being used in
the precise detection of BC in woman with questionable imaging
findings. Videssa Breast can be used concomitantly with imaging to
help guide the management of women under the age of 50 with
challenging imaging findings. The test exhibited consistently high
specificity and NPV in all test sets in a prospective manner, further
supporting its clinical use in this intended-use population (BI-
RADS 3 or 4). Further studies evaluating whether Videssa Breast
performs similarly in broader age ranges, high-risk populations, and
additional BI-RADS-defined patients will be important in assessing
the totality of its clinical utility and expanding the clinical use of this
personalized, precise, proteomic clinical assay. Additional model
development is currently being conducted to maximize sensitivity,
thereby increasing clinical utility as a biopsy rule-out test.
Clinical Practice Points
� This study describes the development of an innovative, non-
invasive, actionable tool, Videssa Breast, to detect BC in
women of low- or intermediate risk (BI-RADS 3 or 4) and under
the age of 50.
� To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study of a proteomic
panel (composed of SPBs and TAAbs) being used in the precise
detection of BC in woman with questionable imaging findings.
� The test exhibited consistently high specificity and NPV in all
test sets in a prospective manner, further supporting its clinical
use in this intended-use population.
� In women with questionable or equivocal imaging findings, it is
often difficult to determine whether to proceed with biopsy,
further image, or reassess at a later time. Of particular concern is
the high FP rate associated with BI-RADS 3 or 4 patients, who
are either followed with repeat imaging assessment at 6 months
or recommended for biopsy, respectively. If used prospectively in
conjunction with imaging, Videssa Breast could have reduced
unnecessary biopsies by up to 67%, compared with standard
imaging modalities (P < .0001).
� Therefore, this study supports the use of Videssa Breast,
concomitantly with imaging, to help guide the management of
women under the age of 50 with challenging imaging findings.
