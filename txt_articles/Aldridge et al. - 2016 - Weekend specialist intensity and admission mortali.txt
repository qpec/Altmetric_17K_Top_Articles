Summary
Background Increased mortality rates associated with weekend hospital admission (the so-called weekend eff
 ect) have 
been attributed to suboptimum staffi
  ng levels of specialist consultants. However, evidence for a causal association is 
elusive, and the magnitude of the weekend specialist defi
 cit remains unquantifi
 ed. This uncertainty could hamper 
eff
 orts by national health systems to introduce 7 day health services. We aimed to examine preliminary associations 
between specialist intensity and weekend admission mortality across the English National Health Service.
Methods Eligible hospital trusts were those in England receiving unselected emergency admissions. On Sunday June 15 
and Wednesday June 18, 2014, we undertook a point prevalence survey of hospital specialists (consultants) to obtain 
data relating to the care of patients admitted as emergencies. We defi
 ned specialist intensity at each trust as the self-
reported estimated number of specialist hours per ten emergency admissions between 0800 h and 2000 h on Sunday 
and Wednesday. With use of data for all adult emergency admissions for fi
 nancial year 2013–14, we compared 
weekend to weekday admission risk of mortality with the Sunday to Wednesday specialist intensity ratio within each 
trust. We stratifi
 ed trusts by size quintile.
Findings 127 of 141 eligible acute hospital trusts agreed to participate; 115 (91%) trusts contributed data to the point 
prevalence survey. Of 34 350 clinicians surveyed, 15 537 (45%) responded. Substantially fewer specialists were present 
providing care to emergency admissions on Sunday (1667 [11%]) than on Wednesday (6105 [42%]). Specialists present 
on Sunday spent 40% more time caring for emergency patients than did those present on Wednesday (mean 5·74 h 
[SD 3·39] vs 3·97 h [3·31]); however, the median specialist intensity on Sunday was only 48% (IQR 40–58) of that on 
Wednesday. The Sunday to Wednesday intensity ratio was less than 0·7 in 104 (90%) of the contributing trusts. 
Mortality risk among patients admitted at weekends was higher than among those admitted on weekdays (adjusted 
odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·08–1·11; p<0·0001). There was no signifi
 cant association between Sunday to Wednesday 
specialist intensity ratios and weekend to weekday mortality ratios (r –0·042; p=0·654).
Interpretation This cross-sectional analysis did not detect a correlation between weekend staffi
  ng of hospital specialists 
and mortality risk for emergency admissions. Further investigation is needed to evaluate whole-system secular 
change during the implementation of 7 day services. Policy makers should exercise caution before attributing the 
weekend eff
 ect mainly to diff
 erences in specialist staffi
  ng.

Introduction
Provision of 7 day health services is a key policy for the UK 
Government,1 a strategic objective for the English National 
Health Service (NHS),2 and a topic of potential interest to 
other health systems trying to maximise effi
  cient use of 
infrastructure and resources.3 Policy makers have focused 
particularly on the increased mortality associated with 
weekend admission (the so-called weekend eff
 ect), fi
 rst 
described in 2001, by Bell and Redelmeier,4 who suggested 
that this eff
 ect might be attributable to reduced hospital 
physician staffi
  ng at weekends. Since then, the weekend 
eff
 ect has been shown to be ubiquitous in all high-income 
health systems in which it has been studied;5 the relative 
risk increase for unselected emergency admissions in 
England and the USA is estimated to be 16%,6 translating 
into many thousands of lives lost each year.
Both the UK Secretary of State for Health7 and the 
Department of Health8 have explicitly attributed the 
weekend eff
 ect to reduced availability of hospital doctors, 
particularly consultants, stating that changes to doctors’ 
employment contracts will be needed. In 2013, NHS 
England published ten standards for 7 day services, 
relating to emergency admissions at weekends, to be 
implemented by 2016–17,9 of which six standards 
specifi
 cally require that care should be directed or 
delivered by consultants or senior decision makers.
Despite professional and public support for improved 
senior medical staffi
  ng of hospitals at weekends,9,10 
evidence that this approach will reduce the weekend 
eff
 ect is elusive. Alternative explanations for the weekend 
eff
 ect include selection bias through casemix variation,11,12 
restricted access to diagnostic services,13 and (for stroke)

reduced nurse staffi
  ng.14 Potential mechanisms by which 
specialists might mitigate the weekend eff
 ect include 
reduced error and improved diagnostic and therapeutic 
accuracy.14–17 Although physician intensity has been 
associated with worse outcomes at the organisational 
level,18–20 it has not been associated specifi
 cally with the 
weekend eff
 ect.14 The scarcity of evidence for physician 
staffi
  ng is problematic because the potential costs of 
implementation of 7 day services (including increased 
consultant presence at weekends) are estimated at 
£1·07 billion to £1·43 billion.21
With the High-intensity Specialist Led Acute Care 
(HiSLAC) project, we aim to test the hypothesis that the 
weekend eff
 ect is attributable to reduced senior staffi
  ng, 
using the natural experiment off
 ered by the roll-out of 
NHS England’s 7 day services in acute hospital trusts in 
England over 5 years (2014–18), which includes enhanced 
medical staffi
  ng at weekends. The study is done in two 
phases. The fi
 rst phase is reported here and examines 
preliminary associations between intensity and weekend 
admission mortality across the NHS. Phase 2 will take 
place over the next 4 years to evaluate secular changes in 
these variables.
Methods
Study design and procedures
Eligible participant trusts were those in England 
receiving unselected emergency admissions. Each trust 
was invited to appoint a HiSLAC local project lead. 
Endorsement for the project was obtained from NHS 
England, the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges and 
patient representatives, and the NHS Confederation. 
The National Research Ethics Committee approved this 
phase of the project as service evaluation of an existing 
form of health-care delivery without collecting patient-
identifi
 able data.
We convened a moderated workshop of delegates with 
expertise in hospital medicine, human resources, and 
health services research, with follow-up by email. We 
defi
 ned specialists as consultants or associate specialists 
with a certifi
 cate of completion of specialist training or 
equivalent. Two instruments were developed and piloted 
before implementation: a point prevalence survey 
designed to acquire information as close to the bedside 
as 
possible, 
and 
a 
directorate-level 
managerial 
questionnaire (appendix).
The link to the web-enabled point prevalence survey 
was distributed by email to all specialists in participating 
trusts by local project leads by use of trust-generated 
distribution lists. The survey sought non-attributable data 
relating to the care of emergency admissions on 2 days in 
June, 2014: Sunday 15th and Wednesday 18th. Sunday and 
Wednesday were selected because they are associated 
with the highest and lowest admission mortality risks, 
respectively,6 and specialist intensity is likely to be at its 
lowest on Sunday. June was chosen because it contains no 
public holidays in England and is unaff
 ected by winter 
pressures. Respondents were asked to confi
 rm specialist 
status, their specialty and location in the hospital, and to 
estimate the number of hours they had spent between 
0800 h and 2000 h on each of these days specifi
 cally 
caring for patients who had been admitted as emergencies. 
Local project leads were emailed four reminders in the 
month following these dates.
The managerial directorate-level questionnaire focused 
on four acute specialties central to the emergency 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Increased availability of hospital specialists (consultants) at 
weekends is central to the provision of 7 day services and has 
been proposed as the solution to the so-called weekend 
eff
 ect—the increased mortality associated with weekend 
admission to hospital reported by many health systems 
worldwide. Policy makers need to identify whether increased 
presence of specialists at weekends is a cost-eff
 ective 
intervention. The HiSLAC project addresses this need. We 
searched MEDLINE, CINHAL, Embase, HMIC, EThOS, and the 
Cochrane Library from Jan 1, 2000, to April 15, 2015, for 
quantitative and qualitative publications relating to the 
weekend eff
 ect, with no language restrictions. Our search terms 
were “weekend/weekday” or “out-of-hours”, and “hospital 
admissions”. Our search retrieved 5404 publications, of which 
959 were considered potentially relevant. No report quantifi
 ed 
the diff
 erence in specialist staffi
  ng between weekends and 
weekdays and explicitly linked the defi
 cit in specialist staffi
  ng to 
the magnitude of the weekend eff
 ect across specialties at 
national level. Weekends are associated with higher error rates 
than weekdays, and with more failure-to-rescue events linked 
to reduced nursing intensity. The weekend eff
 ect might also be 
attributable to increased severity of illness of patients admitted 
at weekends.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the fi
 rst study in a national health 
system to quantify specialist involvement in the care of 
emergency admissions at weekends and weekdays, and to 
analyse this with weekend and weekday admission mortality 
rates. We found no correlation across diff
 erent trusts between 
the mortality risk for emergency admissions at weekends and 
the relative levels of specialist involvement on Sundays and 
Wednesdays.
Implications of all the available evidence
The two-phase HiSLAC project will evaluate the whole-system 
secular change during the implementation of 7 day services 
from 2014 to 2018. At this stage, policy makers should be 
cautious in ascribing the weekend eff
 ect to a single component 
in a complex system.

non-operative patient pathway: the emergency department 
(including the clinical decision unit), acute medical unit, 
intensive care unit, and acute medical wards receiving 
acute medical emergencies. The questionnaire was 
distributed 4 months after the point prevalence survey by 
local project leads to the clinical directors of these services. 
The aims of the questionnaire were to cross-validate 
information about specialty intensity with the point 
prevalence survey, and to gain additional information 
about specialist practice in relation to 7 day services.
Statistical analysis
Specialist intensity at each trust is defi
 ned as the self-
reported estimated number of specialist hours per ten 
emergency admissions between 0800 h and 2000 h on 
Sunday and Wednesday. The emergency admission rate 
was obtained from the Hospital Episode Statistics dataset 
 
and calculated as the mean for that day (Sunday or 
Wednesday, 24 h) throughout the fi
 nancial year 2013–14. 
The imperfect correspondence between time windows 
for numerator and denominator takes into account the 
fact that specialists would have been attending emergency 
patients who had been admitted throughout the entire 
24 h, not just those admitted during the day, and the 
absence of a time stamp in Hospital Episode Statistics 
data. Because not all specialists responded to the 
questionnaire, and in view of variable response rates 
between trusts, estimates of total specialist hours from 
the point prevalence survey were scaled up with the 
reciprocals of the survey response rates in each trust.
Directorate-level questionnaire data for the four acute 
specialties were correlated with the corresponding trust 
data from the point prevalence survey to test data validity. 
We used the Sunday to Wednesday intensity ratio to 
quantify the relative levels of specialist engagement on 
those days. Scaling for response rates had no eff
 ect on 
Sunday to Wednesday ratios. To account for trust size, we 
stratifi
 ed trusts by quintiles, with bed numbers acquired 
from the mean average of NHS England’s (KH03) 
quarterly submissions for 2014,22 or with data from the 
most recent Care Quality Commission inspection.23
We obtained data for emergency hospital admissions for 
fi
 nancial year 2013–14, from the Health and Social Care 
Information Centre. We analysed in-hospital mortality 
using a logistic regression model at the individual patient 
level for adult patients undergoing emergency admission, 
excluding patients younger than 16 years and primary 
maternity admissions. We included interaction terms for 
trust, day of admission (Monday to Sunday), sex, age 
(using a restricted cubic spline with 5 knots), the income

deprivation component of the Index of Multiple 
Deprivation 2010, diagnostic category (as represented by 
the Clinical Classifi
 cation Software code, and a categorised 
index of comorbidity. The comorbidity term includes the 
three categories of the Charlson score used by the English 
NHS Summary Hospital-Level Mortality Indicator.24 This 
approach is similar to that of Freemantle and colleagues.6 
We used this model to obtain adjusted estimates of 
system-wide admission-day and weekend eff
 ects. A 
system-wide estimate of the weekend eff
 ect was calculated 
as the diff
 erence (on a log odds scale) between the average 
of the Saturday and Sunday coeffi
  cients and the average of 
the fi
 ve weekday coeffi
  cients.
To investigate the eff
 ect of weekend admission in each 
trust, the model was refi
 tted with additional trust × weekend 
terms to indicate admission by each trust on a Saturday or 
Sunday. The coeffi
  cients of these terms were added to the 
system-wide weekend eff
 ect estimate in the refi
 tted model 
to obtain trust-level weekend eff
 ects. These eff
 ects are 
reported as trust-specifi
 c odds ratios (ORs). We investigated 
the association between the trust-specifi
 c weekend ORs 
and the specialist intensity ratios using correlation 
methods. The focus on ratios within trusts, rather than 
absolute levels of weekend mortality and specialist 
intensity, minimises the eff
 ect of unmeasured diff
 erences 
in casemix and other potential trust-level confounders.
Data extraction was done with Microsoft SQL server

participating trusts. 96 (76%) trusts had one site with an 
emergency department, 26 (20%) trusts had two sites, 
and fi
 ve (4%) trusts had three sites. 115 (91%) of the 
127 participating trusts contributed data to the point 
prevalence survey. Of 34 350 clinicians surveyed, 
15 537 (45%) responded (table 1), with response rates 
ranging from 45 (16%) of 276 responders to 309 (79%) of 
393 responders, and exceeding 40% in two-thirds of 
trusts. 1003 (6%) responders did not hold a specialist 
accreditation and two (<1%) had incomplete responses 
and were excluded from further analysis (table 1).
Substantially fewer specialists were present and 
providing care to emergency admissions on Sunday than 
on Wednesday (table 1). This diff
 erence was partly off
 set 
by the greater average time (40%) spent in the care of 
acutely admitted patients per specialist present on 
Sunday than on Wednesday (table 1). These patterns 
were consistent across the quintiles of trust size (table 1).
For both Sunday and Wednesday, a clear association 
was evident between the sum of specialist hours delivered 
by each trust and the numbers of emergency admissions 
on that day averaged across the year: larger hospitals had 
more specialists and more admissions (fi
 gure 1). There 
was substantial variation between trusts in the estimated 
number of hours delivered for the same mean admission 
rate (fi
 gure 1). However, the association with emergency 
admissions disappeared when specialist hours were 
expressed per ten emergency admissions (fi
 gure 1), with 
wide variation particularly among the medium to smaller 
trusts in terms of specialist intensity at any given 
emergency admission volume.
Factors other than emergency workload might aff
 ect 
the amount of specialist time delivered to emergency 
admissions in any given trust. To adjust for workload, 
specialist intensity estimates are expressed in relation to 
the number of emergency admissions in table 1 and 
fi
 gure 2. The median Sunday to Wednesday intensity 
ratio was 0·48 across all trusts, with similar results 
within each quintile of trust size (table 1). No trust had a 
ratio that was greater than 1, and in 104 (90%) of the 
115 contributing trusts the ratio was less than 0·7 
(fi
 gure 2).
These results are necessarily reliant on the 45% of 
specialists who responded to the survey. To investigate 
the possibility that specialists who were present on the 
survey days were more likely to respond than those who 
were not, we examined the correlations between the trust 
response rates and the proportions of specialists present 
on Wednesday (r –0·023; p=0·810) and on Sunday 
(–0·184; p=0·049). These correlations were fairly small, 
suggesting that any responder bias present most likely 
occurs in a similar manner across all trusts, although its 
presence cannot be completely discounted.
For the directorate-level questionnaire, 40 (31%) of the 
127 participant trusts provided complete responses for all 
four clinical service areas involved in the care of

non-operative 
emergency 
admissions 
(emergency 
department [plus clinical decision unit], acute medical 
unit, intensive care unit, and acute medical wards 
receiving acute medical emergencies); 41 (32%) trusts 
supplied partial datasets, and 46 (36%) trusts did not 
respond. Clinical directors were asked to estimate the 
number of specialist hours of direct clinical care 
scheduled on a typical Sunday and Wednesday in that 
clinical area. Among responding trusts, moderate 
agreement 
was 
shown 
between 
directorate-level 
questionnaire estimates of specialist hours per ten 
emergency admissions for both Wednesday and Sunday, 
and the point prevalence survey data for the same 
locations (r 0·406, p=0·0002 for Wednesday; 0·480, 
p<0·0001 for Sunday).
Clinical directors were asked how frequently specialists 
reviewed patients. Daily review of all patients was stated by 
respondents to be the norm on Sundays for 35 (50%) of 
70 acute medical units, 70 (100%) of 70 intensive care units, 
and 15 (27%) of 55 acute wards; the corresponding values 
for Wednesdays were 59 (86%) of 69 units, ten (100%) of 
70 units, and 32 (58%) of 55 wards, respectively. Consultant 
vacancies 
resulting 
in 
gaps 
in 
cover 
were 
reported 
by 
33 
(52%) 
of 63 responding emergency departments, 50 (71%) of 
70 acute medical units, 21 (30%) of 70 intensive care units, 
and 36 (65%) of 55 acute wards.
With 2013–14 Hospital Episodes Statistics data, we 
fi
 tted the logistic model to in-hospital mortality data from 
the 141 eligible trusts in England. Results by day of the 
week are presented in table 2. The estimated weekend 
eff
 ect suggests a 10% increase in mortality for weekend 
admissions (table 2). This fi
 nding is lower than the 
11–16% quoted by Freemantle and colleagues,12 who 
included elective admissions in their analysis and used 
30 day mortality following admission.
We estimated trust-specifi
 c weekend ORs for the 
115 trusts contributing to the point prevalence survey. 
These ratios ranged from 0·81 to 1·34, with 96 (83%) 
trusts having ORs greater than 1, indicating an estimated 
excess mortality among weekend admissions (fi
 gure 3). 
There is no systematic association between the weekend 
mortality eff
 ect and trust size (table 1).
The correlation between the weekend mortality OR and 
the Sunday to Wednesday specialist intensity ratio does 
not show a clear association (fi
 gure 4).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the fi
 rst report of diff
 erences 
between weekend and weekday medical specialist 
staffi
  ng in a health-care system. Our fi
 ndings show that 
emergency admissions to English hospitals on a Sunday 
collectively receive on average less than half the input 
(hours per ten emergency admissions) from specialists 
(consultants) of patients admitted on a Wednesday. 
In terms of numbers of specialists present and attending 
to patients who had been admitted as emergencies, no 
hospital achieved even 50% of Wednesday’s staffi
  ng on a

Sunday. Moreover, there was considerable variation 
between hospitals in specialist input on either a Sunday 
or a Wednesday, which was not a function of hospital 
size. The information from the point prevalence survey 
is supported by that from the directorate-level 
questionnaire focused on acute specialties: variation in 
daily ward rounds and gaps in consultant rotas are a 
source of concern for implementation of 7 day services.
With Wednesday as the reference point, we recorded a 
13% excess mortality associated with Sunday admission in 
the 2013–14 Hospital Episodes Statistics dataset, and 9% 
on Saturday. However, there was no association between 
the Sunday to Wednesday specialist intensity ratio and the 
weekend to weekday mortality ratio. The absence of an 
association in this preliminary cross-sectional study does 
not mean that we can discard the hypothesis that the 
weekend eff
 ect is attributable to insuffi
  cient presence of 
specialists, but it does require confi
 rmation from the 
HiSLAC longitudinal study (phase 2) of concurrent 
secular changes in intensity and mortality. Caution must 
be exercised in attributing the weekend eff
 ect to a single 
component in a complex system.5
Limitations of our study refl
 ect the methodological 
challenges of doing health policy research in real time. 
To improve response rates by replacing surveys with time 
and motion studies of specialist involvement in the care 
of acutely ill patients would be prohibitively expensive 
and carry the risk of the Hawthorne eff
 ect, whereas 
repeated point prevalence surveys would generate 
respondent fatigue. Hospital Episodes Statistics data do 
not 
allow 
complete 
casemix 
adjustment. 
These 
limitations have several implications for our results.
Various factors might aff
 ect the intensity–mortality 
association. First, the novel HiSLAC metric of specialist 
hours per ten emergency admissions might have been 
degraded by local biases and sampling fl
 uctuations. 
However, there is little evidence of systematic response-
rate bias, and a demonstrable correlation at trust level 
between the HiSLAC metric and the estimates of 
intensity off
 ered by individual clinical directors in the 
directorate-level questionnaire.
Second, several factors suggest that the weekend eff
 ect 
could be attributable to unmeasured casemix diff
 erences 
rather than intensity and quality of care. Notably, although 
weekend admission is associated with a higher adjusted 
mortality, the death rate in hospital at the weekend is 
actually lower than on weekdays.6 A single-centre 7 year 
retrospective analysis incorporating acute physiology has 
shown that patients admitted at weekends are more 
severely ill than those admitted on weekdays, explaining 
most of the surplus mortality.11 The weekend eff
 ect is also 
detectable in patients undergoing elective weekend 
admission25,26 and those undergoing elective weekend 
surgery;25,27 elective patients admitted at weekends are 
likely to diff
 er from routine weekday admissions—eg, 
those needing more intensive preoperative assessment 
before surgery scheduled on a Monday.
Third, the impact of specialist care might be modifi
 ed by 
variation in other staff
  levels and support services in 
hospital (junior doctors, diagnostics, pharmacy, allied 
health professionals, clerical or administrative services), or 
in community and social care. The need for a system-wide 
approach is supported by evidence that hospital-care 
processes are unreliable at weekends;16,17,28–30 that more 
(or more skilled) nurses are associated with better 
outcomes;14,20,31,32 and that in surgical settings, failure to 
rescue (ie, the inability of the system to respond promptly 
to patient deterioration) not only explains the diff
 erence in 
outcomes between high and low volume centres,33 but also 
the diff
 erence in outcomes from patient safety incidents for 
patients admitted at weekends compared with weekdays.34
Fourth, in view of the paucity of specialist input at 
weekends across the NHS, there might simply be 
insuffi
  cient variation (inadequate involvement) to detect 
an eff
 ect on patient outcomes in a cross-sectional study. 
For example, in a hospital endoscopy centre providing 
24 h specialist-led care, admission to hospital at a 
weekend might be associated with more timely treatment 
than weekdays, not less.35 Thus, it might only be possible 
to detect a benefi
 cial eff
 ect from increased specialist 
intensity at weekends when a suffi
  cient number of 
hospitals achieve parity of staffi
  ng throughout the 7 days, 
and do this with suffi
  cient staff
  levels across all days of 
the week. This notion forms the basis for the second 
phase of the HiSLAC project, which will examine secular 
trends in specialist intensity and the weekend eff
 ect.
In conclusion, there is a substantial diff
 erence between 
weekend and weekday specialist involvement in the care 
of patients admitted as emergencies to acute hospitals in 
England. We are unable to demonstrate an association 
between specialist staffi
  ng and mortality, but would not 
necessarily expect to do so in the fi
 rst year of a 5 year 
longitudinal study. However, this fi
 nding suggests the 
need for caution in attributing the weekend eff
 ect mainly 
to a lack of consultants at weekends. The frequency of 
reported vacancies in consultant rotas for the acute 
specialties and the scarcity of acute specialty consultant-
led ward rounds at weekends should be addressed in the 
context of implementation of 7 day services.
