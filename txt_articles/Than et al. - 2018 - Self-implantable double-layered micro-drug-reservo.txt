Eye diseases and injuries impose a significant clinical problem worldwide. Safe and effective
ocular drug delivery is, however, challenging due to the presence of ocular barriers. Here we
report a strategy using an eye patch equipped with an array of detachable microneedles.
These microneedles can penetrate the ocular surface tissue, and serve as implanted micro-
reservoirs for controlled drug delivery. The biphasic drug release kinetics enabled by the
double-layered micro-reservoirs largely enhances therapeutic efficacy. Using corneal neo-
vascularization as the disease model, we show that delivery of an anti-angiogenic monoclonal
antibody (DC101) by such eye patch produces ~90% reduction of neovascular area. Fur-
thermore, quick release of an anti-inflammatory compound (diclofenac) followed by a sus-
tained release of DC101 provides synergistic therapeutic outcome. The eye patch application
is easy and minimally invasive to ensure good patient compliance. Such intraocular drug
delivery strategy promises effective home-based treatment of many eye diseases.

 T
he increasing prevalence of eye diseases (e.g. glaucoma,
diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration,
etc.) is correlated to the upsurge in aging population,
diabetes mellitus and prolonged wear of contact lens worldwide1–
3. However, efficient delivery of drugs into the eye is challenging
due to the presence of multiple structural barriers (e.g. corneal
epithelium and blood–retinal barrier)4,5. The use of systemic
route (parenteral or oral administration) requires a large dose to
achieve effective local drug concentration, and thus usually pro-
duce off-target systemic side effects6,7. On the other hand, repe-
titive drug applications with high dosage are often required for
convention topical administration (e.g. eye drops or ointments)
due to extremely low bioavailability (<5% can be absorbed by eye)
and fast clearance, which may also lead to systemic side-effects
(e.g. prolonged steroid eye drop usage causes not only ocular
hypertension but also systemic toxicity like uncontrolled hyper-
glycaemia)6–8. Intraocular injection (e.g. intracameral and intra-
vitreal injection) using conventional hypodermic needles to
penetrate the surface barriers (cornea and sclera), however, has
poor patient compliance due to pain, need for frequent clinic
visit, risk of infection, haemorrhage, even permanent damage9.
Similar to topical eye drops, injecting drugs into ocular surface
tissues (e.g. corneal intrastromal layer, sclera) also has poor drug
retention due to back-flow of injected solution and subsequent
tear
wash-out4,6.
Furthermore,
both
conventional
topical
administration and local injection only produce burst release of
drug with short effective duration, which is particularly not ideal
for
treating
chronic
progressive
eye
diseases,
such
as
glaucoma6,10. Although contact lens-like hydrogels have been
developed for improved topical delivery, because of prolonged
drug residence time with minimal burst effect11,12, the bioavail-
ability is still poor. Although implanting intraocular drug reser-
voirs enables sustained release, it requires risky and painful
surgical intervention13. Hence, localized, long-lasting and efficient
ocular drug delivery with good patient compliance is still an
unmet medical need.
Microneedle (MN) technology is originally developed for
transdermal drug delivery for various therapeutic purposes (e.g.
vaccination, local anaesthesia, anti-diabetic and anti-obesity
treatments), with painless, bloodless, high efficiency and ease of
administration properties14–16. Their patient-friendly feature and
effectiveness in transdermal drug release have inspired research-
ers and clinicians to explore their applications in eye disease
treatment. Specifically, drug-coated solid stainless-steel MN have
been used for the rapid release of drugs in the cornea17,18 and
hollow glass MN have been employed to infuse drug solution into
the sclera19.
Here, we show a flexible polymeric eye patch equipped with an
array of biodegradable and detachable MNs for localized, highly
efficient and controlled ocular drug delivery (Fig. 1). MNs can
penetrate the ocular barriers (epithelial and stromal layers of the
cornea) with minimal invasiveness and be self-implanted as drug
reservoirs for controlled drug release. The double-layer structured
MNs allow biphasic release kinetics and packaging of multiple
drugs for synergistic therapy. As the proof-of-concept demon-
stration, we show the superior effectiveness of such eye patch in
the treatment of corneal neovascularization (NV) as compared to
topical eye drop and fast drug-release approaches. A swellable eye
patch without MNs is also used to collect eye fluid for monitoring
the therapeutic effectiveness based on biomarker detection. We
believe this approach could be paradigm-shifting for long-term
home-based treatment and management of various eye diseases.
Results
Fabrication of eye patch with double-layered microneedles.
Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a non-sulphated glycosaminoglycan
distributed abundantly throughout the body in the connective
tissues as well as vitreous eye fluid. As a natural biopolymer with
unique viscoelastic property and transparency, HA has been
widely used in ophthalmology, particularly in artificial tear
solution as a lubricant for dry eyes20. HA-based MN devices have
been employed for transdermal delivery of various hydrophilic or
hydrophobic therapeutic compounds, including proteins, pep-
tides and synthetic molecules14–16. However, because of the fast
dissolving nature of HA, HA-MNs cannot maintain their sharp-
pointed structural integrity and mechanical strength during
penetration into a wet surface like cornea. In addition, HA-MN
can only afford burst release of its cargo14. In comparison,
crosslinked methacrylated HA (MeHA), which is synthesized by
functionalizing HA with methacrylic anhydride (Supplementary
Fig. 1) is more resistive to dissolution and offers a slow release of
its cargo21,22. But the stiffness of MeHA-MNs is inferior to HA-
MNs23,24.
Combining the merits of HA and MeHA, we herein developed
an eye-contact patch equipped with double-layered MNs (DL-MN)
for controlled ocular drug delivery (Fig. 1), using a simple micro-
moulding method (Fig. 2). The MNs have a HA inner core and a
MeHA outer layer. Because the highly dissolvable HA is covered by
MeHA, the MNs are able to penetrate the wet cornea surface.
Briefly, a small amount of MeHA aqueous solution, with or without
therapeutic compounds, was centrifuged into the reverse MN
structures in the female polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mould.
Hollow MN structures were formed after drying in ambient
overnight as hydrophilic and viscous MeHA polymers tend to stick
onto the hydrophilic surface of MN cavities in plasma-treated
PDMS mould. Subsequently, unmodified HA solution, with or
without therapeutic compounds, was filled in the remaining cavities
and air-dried to form solid MNs. Finally, pure HA solution was
introduced into the PDMS mould on top of the MN array to make
the supporting substrate. After drying, the MN patch was peeled off
from the mould and subject to a brief exposure to ultraviolet light to
crosslink MeHA outer layer of MNs.

 As revealed by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
optical microscopy (Supplementary Fig. 2), the fabricated patch
consists of an array of pyramidal-shaped MNs with tip diameter
of ~10 µm, height of ~500 µm, base width of ~250 µm and inter-
needle spacing of ~400 µm. The final MN dimensions are smaller
than the stainless steel templates (300 µm bases with 600 µm
height), due to the shrinkage of PDMS and HA/MeHA during the
fabrication process. The MN design is based on the previous
findings that pyramidal-pointed tips (compared to conical one)
with the aspect ratio of 2:1 (height to base diameter) are optimal
for tissue penetration16,25. The eye patches (~2 × 2 mm) with a
3 × 3 MN array were used for mice whose cornea size is ~3 mm in
diameter (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Immunoglobulins (IgG) labelled with Alexa Fluor 680 or Alexa
Fluor 488 as the model therapeutic compounds were separately
loaded in the different layers of MNs (Fig. 3a, b). The confocal
fluorescence imaging confirms that red IgG(680) and green IgG
(488) can be separately encapsulated in the outer and inner layers
of MN, respectively, while the substrate is free of IgG molecules
(Fig. 3c–e). Upon insertion of MNs into the tissue simply by
thumb pressing on the supporting substrate, the tissue fluid is
drawn into the MNs and quickly dissolves the interfacial HA
layer between the MNs and substrate whereby causing detach-
ment of MNs (Fig. 1). The embedded DL-MNs serve as the
micro-reservoirs for localized and sustained drug release. The
inner HA core being exposed to the tissue fluid undertakes quick
dissolution and discharge of the cargo, whereas the outer MeHA
layer dissolves slowly letting the cargo molecules slowly seep
through the crosslinked polymer matrix.
IgG recovered from 3 × 3 DL-MNs dissolved in phosphate
buffer saline (PBS) is 0.92 ± 0.21 µg, correlating well with the
nominal loading amount (1 µg) (Supplementary Fig. 3a). In vitro
stability of encapsulated IgGs was tested by evaluating their
molecular weight on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after
storage of MN patch at 4 °C for 1 week. Majority of IgGs (82.11 ±
11.2%) released from either HA or crosslinked MeHA matrix was
intact
as
evidenced
by
the
expected
band
at
~150 kDa
(Supplementary Fig. 3b). The bioactivity of IgGs (specific to
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, VEGFR2) released
from MNs (being stored for 5 days) over 24 h duration was
confirmed by immunofluorescence staining demonstrating the
capability of binding and recognizing VEGFR2 on endothelial
cells (Supplementary Fig. 3c). The bioactivity of IgGs released
from MNs (being stored for 5 days) over 6, 24 or 120 h duration
was further confirmed by their inhibitory effect on endothelial
cell tube formation (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Furthermore,
in vitro biocompatibility of DL-MNs was proven by the well-
preserved morphology and viability of corneal epithelial cells with
the presence of either un-modified HA or crosslinked MeHA
(Supplementary Fig. 4b).
Characterization of double-layered micro-drug-reservoirs. In
vitro drug release kinetics was examined by monitoring the
release profiles of different IgG molecules encapsulated in the two
compartments of DL-MNs. As shown in Fig. 3f, IgG(488) loaded
in the fast dissolving inner HA layer can be quickly released in
both artificial tear fluid (which mimics tear) and gelatin hydrogel
(which mimics corneal stromal tissue26). Specifically, >80% was
released within 5 min in the former and 30 min in the latter. In
contrast, prolonged release profile was observed for IgG(680)
loaded in the crosslinked MeHA outer layer (t1/2 of ~2 days in
tear fluid and ~3 days in gelatin hydrogel) because IgG molecules
can only slowly diffuse through the interwoven meshwork of
MeHA. In comparison to the fast release from HA-MNs or slow
release from MeHA-MNs, the bi-phasic release profile was rea-
lized when a single drug molecule, IgG(680), was loaded in both
compartments of DL-MNs (Fig. 3g).
To predict in vivo drug release profile, DL-MNs were
embedded within the agarose hydrogel (which mimics corneal
tissue in which water content is ~80%) and were continuously
monitored under confocal microscope (Fig. 4a). Immediately
after insertion, DL-MNs were quickly detached from the
supporting substrate (<60 s) into the hydrogel because fluid was
quickly drawn into MN-substrate junction. As the supporting
substrate is made of highly-dissolvable low-molecular-weight HA
(3–10 kDa), HA molecules at the MN-substrate junction dissolve
rapidly as the fluid inside and at the surface are quickly drawn
into the hydrophilic HA matrix. The patches were then removed
allowing MNs embedded into the hydrogel. The mechanic
perturbation caused by the penetration and substrate removal
process also facilitates MN detachment. The fast-dissolving HA
inner-core released the loaded green IgG(488) within 10 min,
while the crosslinked MeHA outer-shell gradually swelled and
slowly discharged the encapsulated red IgG(680) into the
hydrogel (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 5a). The real-time release
profile
of
double-layered
micro-implants

hydrogel
was
captured by fluorescence microscopy as shown in Fig. 4b. Taken
together, our data demonstrate the biphasic release kinetics of
DL-MNs, i.e. a burst phase followed by a slow discharge over
several days. Note that MNs in hydrogel were barely visible under
bright field imaging (Supplementary Fig. 5), suggesting that they
are essentially transparent and hence suitable for use in corneal
tissue.
The mechanical strength of MNs was assessed by compression
test. Consistent with other studies, the mechanical strength of

 HA-MNs (~0.4 N per needle) is strong enough for skin
penetration (Fig. 3h)27. In contrast, the mechanical strength of
crosslinked MeHA-MNs (~0.15 N per needle) is much weaker.
Because
MeHA
is
highly
viscose,
only
a
lower
polymer
concentration can be used to fabricate MNs (50 mg/ml for
MeHA-MNs vs. 200 mg/ml for HA-MNs). This compromises the
mechanical strength of MeHA. The mechanical strength of DL-
MNs is similar to that of HA-MNs (~0.4 N per needle), indicating
that the mechanic property of DL-MN is dictated by the inner
HA core. In addition, drug loading into DL-MNs (2 µg) does not
compromise the mechanical properties of DL-MNs (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 2g). It has been reported that, when an 18G hypodermic
needle (outer diameter of 1.27 mm) is used, the force required to
penetrate human cornea is ~0.5 N per needle28. Considering the
sharp tip of a MN (~10 µm), the force needed to penetrate the
cornea can be much lower29.
To further confirm the insertion capability and drug releases of
DL-MNs, MN-patches were applied on the porcine cornea simply
by thumb pressing (~1.9 N, ~30 s) (Fig. 5a). Porcine eye has been
commonly used as a good model for studying cornea, as its
anatomical structures, water content and thickness (~0.9 mm) are
similar to that of human cornea (~0.6 mm)30. As demonstrated in
Fig. 5c, d, MNs were well-penetrated and embedded into the
porcine cornea. The subsequent histological study shows cavities
into the corneal stromal layer ~150 µm deep which is about one-
third of MN height (Fig. 5e). This is because of compressive
deformation of MN (Supplementary Fig. 2h), and the elastic
property
of
the
cornea
provided
by
the
densely-packed
intertwining collagen fibrils31. Such elastic deformations make
polymeric DL-MNs advantageous over metallic MNs which may
cause corneal puncture32. The insertion force into the cornea was
estimated (Fig. 5f). The force required to penetrate is ~0.05 N per
needle, as indicated by the transition point where resistance from
the tissue sharply increases. The success rate of MN embedment
is ~85% as evidenced by visual inspection of the removed
substrate (Fig. 5c, d) and the fluorescence marks left behind
(Fig. 5g). The fluorescence spots in the cornea from the
embedded MNs were further analysed by confocal microscopy

 (Fig. 5i). Similar to the results shown in Fig. 4, HA inner-core
quickly discharged its cargo IgG(488) while the crosslinked
MeHA outer-shell slowly released IgG(680) into the corneal
tissue. We also observed that the transmittance in the visible
range of fully hydrated DL-MN is about 73–86%, which is
comparable to that of cornea and aqueous humour (Fig. 5j)33.
Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that DL-MNs are
strong enough to penetrate into the cornea, easy to detach from
the supporting patch after insertion, transparent inside the cornea
and capable of biphasic release kinetics.
In vivo studies of biosafety and ocular drug delivery. The
capability of insertion and drug releases of DL-MNs was further
investigated in vivo. DL-MN patch loaded with IgG(680) was
gently pressed onto the cornea of mouse eye for ~30 s (Fig. 6a).
MNs were quickly detached from the supporting substrate and
implanted into the cornea. MN patch before and after being
applied onto the cornea is shown in Fig. 6b and the detachment of
MNs is evidenced. The treated eyes were flushed with PBS, and
then examined with the fluorescence and bright-field imaging. In
vivo fluorescence images indicate that fluorescence intensity of
IgG(680) was strong only at the MN insertion spots, but absent in
the control eye (Fig. 6c), suggesting the successful implantation of
MNs into the cornea. Figure 6d shows a representative bright-
field image of the mouse eye immediately after MN insertion (day
0). The MN applied corneas were further analysed under confocal
microscope. It was found that IgG(680)-loaded MNs were
embedded within the cornea (~90% success rate), as evidenced by
visual inspection of the removed substrate (Fig. 6b) and the
fluorescence marks left behind (Fig. 6e). Subsequent histological
examination revealed the small penetration cavities (~100 µm)
inside the corneal stromal layer, similar to the observation in
porcine cornea (Fig. 5e).
The corneal anatomical structures after MN insertion were
monitored over 1 week (Fig. 6f). We did not observe any
puncture on cornea in all experiments (Fig. 6f), suggesting that
DL-MNs are strong enough to penetrate into the stromal layer,
but not too stiff to spear throughout the whole cornea. And the
small insertion marks were only observed immediately after
insertion in all mice (day 0) and almost disappeared after 24 h
(Fig. 6f), suggesting the closure of epithelium through the
spontaneous repairing process. At days 3 and 7, DL-MN-treated
corneal epithelium restored its structural integrity and appeared
as normal as untreated cornea in all mice (Fig. 6f). There were no
significant differences of body weight and food intake between the
control and test groups (Fig. 6g, h). And there were no visible
indications of corneal opacity, inflammation or haemorrhage in
any MN-treated eyes (Fig. 6d). We also did not observe any signs
of pain in the test group based on the grimace scale pain
assessment (Fig. 6i)34. All these observations indicate that MN
insertion and implantation into cornea is minimally invasive

 without causing obvious adverse effects on the eyes, general
health state and behaviour.
As shown in Fig. 6j, systemic injection (peritoneal injection) of
10 µg IgG(680) led to strong fluorescence in all major organs
(liver, kidney, heart, lung, etc.), but not the eyes. Local instillation
of IgG(680) containing eye-drop also produced fluorescence
signal in liver and lung, in addition to the treated eye. This is
consistent with the notion that topical instillation results in
systemic drug distribution away from the eye via the highly
vascularized conjunctiva7. In contrast, intra-corneal delivery of
IgG(680) at the same dose using MN patch only introduced
fluorescence signal in the applied eye (much stronger than that
caused by eye-drop). In addition, fluorescence signal in the eye
was still observable for over 3 days (Fig. 6k), showing that the
intra-corneal micro-implants act as drug-depots for localized and
sustained ocular drug delivery.
Double-layered MNs improve the efficacy of anti-VEGF ther-
apy. Eye trauma, including chemical injury and infection, can
trigger corneal NV, and may cause corneal opacity, visual
impairment and even blindness. Studies have shown that vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key mediator of corneal
NV. VEGF promotes blood vessel formation mainly via VEGF
receptor type 2 (VEGFR2)35. Recently, anti-VEGF therapies (e.g.
ranibizumab) have become standard care for vaso-proliferative
diseases, including those in the eye36–38. However for angiogenic
ocular diseases like corneal NV, frequent high-dose topical
application is required to overcome ocular barrier (e.g. corneal
epithelium), which is accompanied with adverse effects (e.g.
subconjunctival haemorrhage)8,37. On the other hand, conven-
tional intraocular injection may cause infection, bleeding and
retinal detachment9. Here, we demonstrate the advantages of DL-
MN eye-patches for improving the therapeutic efficacy of the
anti-VEGF drug (Fig. 7).
Corneal NV was induced by the well-established alkali burn-
injury model (day 0). At day 2 when neovascular growth was
started to appear from the limbus (the border between cornea and
sclera), mice corneas were treated once with non-specific control
IgG or anti-VEGFR2 IgG (DC101) delivered through topical eye-
drop or MN patch application (Fig. 7). DC101 was used because
of its proven effectiveness against angiogenesis in murine

 models39. Similar to the un-treated eyes, eyes treated with control
IgG eye-drop showed substantial corneal NV (1.48 ± 0.45 vs. 1.50
± 0.24 mm2) (day 7). Similarly, topical delivery of DC101 via eye-
drop (with a high dose of 10 µg in 10 µl) had no significant effect
on corneal NV as compared to the untreated eyes (1.24 ± 0.21
mm2). In contrast, eyes treated with DC101 (~1 µg) delivered
through fast-dissolving HA-only MNs led to ~44% reduction in
neovascular area (0.84 ± 0.43 mm2) (Fig. 7). This is consistent
with the previous studies that ~40% reduction of corneal NV can
be
expected
using
rapid
ocular
delivery
approaches
(e.g.
subconjunctival injection or delivery using drug-coated stain-
less-steel solid MNs)18,40. Even though the efficacy of highly-
targeted ocular drug delivery using HA-only MN is much better
than topical application, such rapid drug delivery could not
efficiently suppress the continuous outgrowth of immature blood
vessels because of the fast drug clearance by natural fluid
circulation in the eye. The same problem makes conventional
intraocular injection ineffective for many eye diseases4,7.
In comparison, we found that DC101 delivered through DL-
MN (~1 µg equally divided into the inner core and outer shell of
MN) offered much improved therapeutic effect with 90%
reduction of neovascular area (0.12 ± 0.17 mm2) (Fig. 7). Both
the vessel extension (from the limbus) and circumference (in
clock hours) were significantly reduced by DC101-loaded DL-
MN patches, owing to the bi-phasic release profile of DC101. DL-
MNs not only provide initial bolus dose to quickly reach the
therapeutic level at the early onset of the disease, but also sustain
drug release to maintain therapeutic effect for a much longer
period. Eyes treated with control IgG using either HA-only MN
or DL-MN showed no significant changes compared with the
untreated ones. In summary, the desirable therapeutic outcome
observed in DL-MNtreated group is attributable to both highly-
targeted and controlled drug delivery.
Combinational therapy using double-layered MNs for syner-
gistic effect. Ocular delivery of multiple drugs at different stages
of the disease progression can offer a more effective treatment
outcome due to their synergistic effects. It is well known that the
initial inflammatory response is a key factor to trigger ocular NV
(e.g. corneal NV, uveitis-related ocular NV). Under chronic
inflammatory condition, inflammatory cells (e.g. macrophages)
produce a large number of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g.
interleukin 6, IL6) and angiogenic growth factors (particularly
VEGF), which creates a vicious circle of persistent inflammation
and NV. To tackle this issue, DL-MNs were loaded with two

 drugs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (1 µg diclofenac) in
its fast-dissolving HA core and anti-VEGFR2 drug (0.5 µg
DC101) in slow-dissolving crosslinked MeHA shell. As shown in
Fig. 8, ocular delivery of either only DC101 in MeHA layer or
only diclofenac in HA core using DL-MN patch exerted inhibi-
tion on neovascular area (0.52 ± 0.20 and 0.63 ± 0.25 mm2,
respectively). The therapy combining both drugs was much more
effective (0.16 ± 0.24 mm2). We further show in Supplementary
Fig. 6 that that even the high dosage of either one of the drugs, i.e.
diclofenac (2 or 5 µg in HA) without DC101 or DC101 (1 or 2.5
µg in MeHA) without diclofenac, is not able to attain the ther-
apeutic outcomes as good as provided by the combinational
delivery (1 µg diclofenac in HA plus 0.5 µg DC101 in MeHA).
This experiment further confirms the synergistic combination of
these two types of drugs. In comparison, topical instillation of
same-dosage of both DC101 and diclofenac produced no sig-
nificant therapeutic effect (Fig. 8).
We further analysed the corneal inflammation by immuno-
fluorescence staining (Fig. 9a, b), and demonstrate that the cornea
treated with diclofenac alone in HA core showed significantly fewer
infiltrating F4/80-positive
macrophages as compared to the
untreated cornea. Although DC101 alone (loaded in MeHA shell)
suppressed corneal inflammation to a lesser extent, DL-MNs-loaded
with
both
diclofenac
and
DC101
showed
most
significant
suppression on the number of infiltrating macrophages. Taken
together, these observations show that (i) fast release of diclofenac
alone mainly suppresses inflammation with limited anti-angiogenic
effects; (ii) conversely, the slow release of DC101 is poorly effective
in inhibiting inflammation despite its strong anti-angiogenic effect;
(iii) a quick release of diclofenac followed by a sustained release of
DC101 led to a much better treatment outcome.
Tear fluid can accurately reflect the dynamic changes of ocular
surface tissue (e.g. cornea, sclera)41. As MeHA-based patch is
highly swellable24, it was used to collect mouse tear film for
analysis of the concentration of inflammatory and angiogenic
cytokines (e.g. IL6, VEGF) in tear film after treatment (Fig. 9c).
As shown in Fig. 9d, the pore size of the fully swelled MeHA-
patch is 2–5 µm, suggesting that large proteins can be easily

 absorbed. The absorption of Cy5-conjugated albumin from
agarose hydrogel confirms the suitability of the patch to collect
biomarkers in tear film. Consistent with the previous study41,
both IL6 and VEGF levels in tear film of burn-induced corneal
NV were significantly higher than those in normal tear film
(Fig. 9e, f). And consistent with our results of macrophage
infiltration shown in Fig. 9a, b, DL-MN delivery of DC101 and
diclofenac produced most significant effect on reducing those
cytokine levels in tear film.
Discussion
Effective ocular drug delivery for the treatment of vision-
threatening diseases (such as glaucoma and neovascular compli-
cations, etc.) remains challenging due to the presence of various
anatomical and physiological barriers4. Herein, we demonstrate
an eye patch with micro-drug-reservoirs self-implantable into the
ocular surface tissue for controlled drug release. The flexible patch
can be readily applied by gentle and brief thumb pressing on the
ocular surface, which is as easy as wearing a disposable contact
lens without causing discomfort or requiring high skills. As the
micro-drug-reservoirs comprise multiple compartments, they
allow the release of the same drug with biphasic kinetics or
sequentially release of different drugs for synergistic therapy.
Comparing to conventional topical eye drop application which
requires repeated high-dose instillation and often associates with
systemic side-effects, and comparing to painful and risky
intraocular injections in clinics, the demonstrated eye patches
offer a unique opportunity for patients to conveniently and
effectively manage their eye disorders at home.
Here, corneal NV in mice was used as the disease model to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We demonstrate
that intra-corneal delivery of DC101 (a monoclonal antibody that
blocks VEGFR2)
using
micro-implants
can
achieve
~90%
reduction of neovascular area with a single treatment of 1 µg
dosage. In comparison, eye drop application of DC101 even at a
much higher dosage (10 µg) failed to show significant therapeutic
effect. In a previous study, systemic intraperitoneal injection of 1
mg DC101 (every 2nd day for 1 week) only led to marginal effect
(~20% reduction of neovascular area)39. This is expected as the
major challenge faced by ocular drug delivery is the limited ability
of drug molecules to penetrate the ocular tissue efficiently, due to
the presence of ocular barriers. It has been reported that only
0.1% of bevacizumab (a monoclonal antibody against VEGF) in
eye drop can reach aqueous humour42. It has been shown that eye
drop application of 10 µg axitinib (another anti-VEGF agent;
daily for 10 days) failed to show significant effect on corneal NV
of mice43. Clinical studies in human suggested that repeated high-
dosage of topical administration is required for the treatment of
corneal NV disease. But still only ~41% or ~48% reduction of
neovascular area can be achieved using ranibizumab eye drop
(~0.2 mg, 4 times daily for 3 weeks)36 or bevacizumab eye drop
(~0.1 mg, 5 times daily for ~3 months)44, respectively. Based on
our mouse experiments and considering that human cornea is
~20 times larger than mice cornea, single treatment with ~20 µg
should be effective for human corneal NV using our approach. As
the human cornea (~600 µm thick, ~11 mm in diameter) is
thicker and larger than mice cornea (~150 µm, ~2.3 mm)30,45, a
larger patch (e.g. 10 × 10 MN array) with longer MNs (e.g. 800
µm) may be suitable for human. With the ability to overcome the
ocular surface barriers for localized delivery with high bioavail-
ability, and achieve multi-phasic release kinetics or synergistic
therapy from sequential release of multiple drugs, our MN
approach can realize low effective dosage and application fre-
quency. This is important to relieve the patient’s burden and
enhance patient compliance.
Although DL-MNs were used in our experiments, triple
compartmentalization can also be fabricated (Supplementary Fig.
7). Here, crosslinked MeHA was chosen as the polymeric matrix
for sustained drug release. Prolonged release for 5–6 days is
achieved by simply loading the drug molecules in MeHA matrix.
Even slower release can be achieved by conjugating the drug
molecules with HA molecules to form nanoparticulate con-
jugates46. Two weeks of sustained release can be attained when
HA-IgG conjugates are loaded in MeHA matrix (Supplementary
Fig. 8). Apart from HA, other biodegradable and biocompatible
polymers may also be utilized, for example, FDA-approved syn-
thetic polymer, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). PLGA has
been used in conventional intraocular implants for sustained
ocular drug delivery (e.g. ozurdex, a dexamethasone-loaded
PLGA-based intravitreal implant)47. By choosing or mixing dif-
ferent PLGA molecules, mechanical properties of MN and drug
release kinetics (several days to months) can be readily tailored14.
Our MN approach promises for other eye diseases as well, for
example, delivery of β-adrenergic receptor blockers or pros-
taglandin analogues for glaucoma10, corticosteroids (e.g. pre-
dnisolone) for anterior uveitis48, fluconazole for fungal keratitis49.
It may also be used for intra-corneal delivery of riboflavin to
patients with keratoconus, without the need of corneal epithelial
scraping and debridement whereby avoiding post-operative pain,
infection and permanent damage usually associated with the
traditional surgical methods50. In summary, the demonstrated
MN eye patch, which implants micro-drug-reservoirs for loca-
lized, controlled and efficient ocular drug delivery in a con-
venient, safe and painless manner, provides a cost-effective and
home-based solution for many ocular diseases.
Methods
Materials. Sodium hyaluronate (HA) with different molecular weights were pur-
chased from Bloomage Freda Biopharm. IgG, IgGs conjugated with Alexa Fluor
dyes, alamarBlue cell viability reagent, Medium 200, low serum growth supple-
ments, Geltrex LDEV-free reduced growth factor basement membrane matrix,
bovine serum albumin (BSA), PBS, penicillin–streptomycin and trypsin-EDTA
were obtained from ThermoFisher Scientific. VEGFR2 antibodies (GTX14094/
DC101, GTX30654, GTX10972) were obtained from GeneTex. Anti-F4/80
(MAB5580) was from R&D Systems. All other reagents and solvents were pur-
chased from Sigma-Aldrich. All reagents were of analytical grade and used without
further purification.
Fabrication of polymeric patches with micro-drug-reservoirs. MN patches were
prepared via simple micromolding method. Briefly, PDMS (Sylgard 184, Dow
Corning) micromolds were created by pouring PDMS solution into the custom-
designed stainless steel master-molds (Micropoint Technologies, Singapore), which
was followed by degassing (10 min in vacuum oven) and curing (70 °C for 2 h). To
fabricate eye patches with DL-MN, MeHA aqueous solution (50 mg/ml MeHA
together with 0.5 mg/ml Irgacure 2959 in DI water) was casted into the plasma-
treated PDMS micromolds through centrifugation (3220g, 5 min). After air-drying
at room temperature in a fume hood (~12 h), un-modified HA solution (~50 kDa,
200 mg/ml) was applied and centrifuged (805g, 5 min) to fill the MN cavities. After
air-drying again for ~12 h, HA solution (<10 kDa, 500 mg/ml) was added to pro-
duce a robust supporting substrate, and dried overnight. Finally, MN patches were
gently peeled off from the micromolds, and exposed to low-intensity ultraviolet
light for 3 min (360 nm, ~2 mW per cm2).
Characterization of MN patches. MN patches were examined using a field-
emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM; JSM-6700, JEOL), and digital
microscope (Leica DVM6). MN patches loaded with different IgGs—IgG(405), IgG
(488) and IgG(680)—were visualized with a confocal laser scanning microscope
(LSM800, Carl Zeiss). The mechanical property of MNs was tested using an Instron
5543 Tensile Tester (Instron). A vertical force was applied to MNs using a flat-
headed stainless steel cylindrical probe (at a constant speed of 0.5 mm/min). The
force was continuously recorded until a displacement of 450 μm was reached. MN
insertion test was performed on the isolated porcine cornea. Briefly, MNs (3 × 3
MN patch, loaded with or without 2 µg IgG) were mounted onto the cylindrical
probe, and pressed perpendicular to the cornea at a rate of 5 mm/min until a pre-
set maximum load of 4 N was reached. Force exerted on the cornea by the MN as a
function of its displacement into cornea was recorded. The insertion force was
estimated when the force against the cornea showed discontinuity followed by a

 steep slope27. The transmittance of the MNs (loaded with or without 2 µg IgG),
isolated porcine cornea and aqueous humour (in PBS) was measured in a spec-
trophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1800).
To evaluate the in vitro biocompatibility of MNs, primary human corneal
epithelial cells (Merck Millipore, SCCE016) grown with the EpiGRO ocular
complete media (Chemicon, Merck) were exposed to different types of MNs for
2 days, before analysing cell morphology using an inverted microscope (IX71,
Olympus, equipped with a digital camera OlympusE330) and cytotoxicity test
using an almarBlue cell viability assay. The absorbance of the incubated media
containing 10% alamarBlue (~3 h) was measured at 570 nm using a plate reader
(SpectraMax M5, Molecular Devices).
The protein bands of IgGs being released from MNs (on 12% polyacrylamide
gel) were stained with InstantBlue solution (Expedeon) and imaged with a G:BOX
Chemi XT4 imaging system (Syngene). The ability of released IgGs to bind IgG-
specific proteins on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC; Sigma-
Aldrich, 200P-05N) was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. Briefly, cells
were fixed with 4% formaldehyde solution (15 min) before washing with PBS (3
times, 5 min each). After being blocked with 1% BSA in PBST (PBS with 0.1%
tween20) (1 h), the cells were incubated overnight in PBST containing 1% BSA and
anti-VEGFR2 IgG (free IgG or IgG released from MNs). After washing with PBS,
the cells were then incubated with the secondary antibody tagged with Alexa Fluor
680 (2 h), before washing again, and imaging using a confocal microscope.
To evaluate the in vitro bioactivity of IgGs loaded in MNs, HUVECs exposed to
10 ng/ml VEGF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were treated with different doses of anti-
VEGFR2 IgG (free IgG or IgG released from MNs) for ~18 h. Tube formation of
HUVECs grown on the Geltrex matrix (ThermoFisher) was then recorded using an
inverted microscope, and tube lengths were measured using the ImageJ (NIH.gov).
To determine the in vitro insertion capability, MN patches (3 × 3 MN array)
were applied briefly to the porcine cornea (~30 s), before the supporting base was
removed. The corneas were then excised, washed with PBS and analysed for the
presence of fluorescence spots produced from IgG(680) loaded in MNs using
confocal microscopy. For histological analyses, the corneal tissues were fixed with
4% formaldehyde solution (24 h), and cryoprotected with 30% sucrose solution (24
h), before embedding in FSC22 Frozen Section Media (Leica Microsystem) for
cryosectioning (5 µm thick) (CM1950 cryostat, Leica Microsystems), and
haematoxylin and eosin staining (Sigma-Aldrich).
Evaluate in vitro and in vivo drug release profiles. To evaluate the release
profiles of MNs, MNs were immersed in 0.5 ml of simulated tear fluid (NaCl 0.68 g,
NaHCO3 0.22 g, KCl 0.14 g, CaCl2·2H2O 0.008 g, in 100 ml DI water, pH 7.4),
gelatin hydrogel (15% w/v gelatin type b from Sigma-Aldrich, in DI water, pH 7.4)
or PBS (pH 7.4), and placed in an incubator shaker (50 rpm, 37 °C). IgG molecules
(conjugated with Alexa Fluor dyes) released from MNs were measured using a
fluorescence spectrometer (SpectraMax M5, Molecular Devices). The real-time
visualization of IgG releases from DL-MNs in agarose hydrogel (1.4% w/v, in DI
water, pH 7.4) or porcine cornea was analysed using a confocal microscopy.
The in vivo fluorescence imaging of IgG release from MNs was conducted on
mice (C57BL/6J, 7–8 weeks old male). Specifically, under anesthetized condition, a
MN patch with 3 × 3 array of IgG(680)-loaded DL-MNs was gently applied on one
cornea (one eye only) for 30 s. The mice were then imaged immediately (day 0) or
at day 3 using an in vivo imaging system (IVIS Spectrum, Perkin Elmer). In some
experiments, MN-treated mice were euthanized before collecting the eyeballs and
incising the cornea to identify the presence of fluorescence spots produced by MNs
using confocal microscopy.
The in vivo bio-distribution of IgG(680) released from MNs was also analysed.
Briefly, mice were divided into 4 groups, with the treatment of 10 µg IgG(680)
through intraperitoneal injection, topical eye-drop instillation or intra-corneal
delivery using MN patch, or without treatment as a control. At 2 h post-treatment,
the mice were euthanized and the eyes and the major organs (liver, heart, kidney
and lung) were dissected and visualized by IVIS imaging system.
In vivo studies of MN patches. All the animal experiments were approved by the
Nanyang Technological University, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(NTU-IACUC) under protocol ARF-A0350. The mice were housed in light and
temperature controlled facility (12-h light/12-h dark cycle, 21 °C), and allowed free
access to water and normal diet. DL-MN patches (3 × 3 MN array) were applied
onto the central cornea area of anesthetized mice for 30 s. After removing the
supporting base, corneas were imaged by a bright-field microscope. After receiving
MN insertion, mice were immediately returned to their cages, allowing recovery
from anaesthesia. After 10 min, mouse behaviour was monitored to access their
pain (Grimace scales: orbital tightening, nose bulge, check bulge and ear position).
The body weight and food intake were also recorded (days 1, 3 and 7). In some
tested mice groups, mice were euthanized immediately after MN insertion or later
(days 1, 3 and 7), and corneas were collected to examine histological changes.
Ocular burn mouse model for ocular delivery of MN patches. Chemical-burn
injury to the mouse eye was inflicted by placing a sterilized Whatman filter paper
(2 mm) soaked with 1 N NaOH solution for 30 s under the anesthetized condition
(day 0). Eyes were then extensively flushed with sterilized PBS solution (~10 ml)
using a syringe. At day 2, corneal neovascular outgrowths were imaged by a
microscope. Mice were then randomly divided into 6 groups, treated only once
with eye-drop instillation of either non-specific control IgG or anti-VEGFR2-IgG
(DC101) (10 µg in 20 µl PBS), application of HA-only MN loaded with either
control IgG or DC101 (1 µg), or application of DL-MN loaded with either control
IgG or DC101 (1 µg, ~0.5 µg each in both layers). For testing the ocular delivery of
two drugs, mice were randomly divided into different groups, treated only once
with DC101-loaded DL-MN (0.5 µg in MeHA layer), diclofenac-loaded DL-MN (1
µg in HA core), 2-drug-loaded DL-MN (DC101 in MeHA and diclofenac in HA
core), or eye-drop instillation of both drugs. For all the interventions, anaesthesia
was maintained throughout the procedure with 2% isoflurane. After 5–6 days,
corneas were imaged and corneal NV was analysed using ImageJ. Briefly, the vessel
lengths (VL) were measured from the limbus to their leading edges, sectoral cir-
cumference was expressed as clock hours (CH, 1 being 30 degrees of arc), and the
vessel area (VA) was calculated using the formula, VA = 0.2π × VL × CH51. In
some experiments, mice were euthanized and corneas were collected for immu-
nohistochemistry analyses of macrophage infiltration in corneal stromal layer. F4/
80 as a major macrophage marker was stained with a specific antibody. Tear films
from differently treated mice were collected by simply placing MeHA patch
without MNs on their ocular surface for 1 min, before centrifugation of the patch at
16,000g for 5 min. Subsequently, interleukin-6 (IL6) and VEGF concentrations
were determined by IL6 and VEGF ELISA kits (Invitrogen).
Statistical analyses. Quantitative data were represented as mean ± SEM. Statis-
tical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) fol-
lowed by Tukey’s post-hoc test. A p value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.
