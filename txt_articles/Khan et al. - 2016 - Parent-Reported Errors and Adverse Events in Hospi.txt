IMPORTANCE Limited data exist regarding the incidence and nature of patient- and
family-reported medical errors, particularly in pediatrics.
OBJECTIVE To determine the frequency with which parents experience patient safety
incidents and the proportion of reported incidents that meet standard definitions of medical
errors and preventable adverse events (AEs).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted a prospective cohort study from May
2013 to October 2014 within 2 general pediatric units at a children’
s hospital. Included in the
study were English-speaking parents (N = 471) of randomly selected inpatients (ages 0-17
years) prior to discharge. Parents reported via written survey whether their child experienced
any safety incidents during hospitalization. Two physician reviewers classified incidents as
medical errors, other quality issues, or exclusions (κ = 0.64; agreement = 78%). They then
categorized medical errors as harmful (ie, preventable AEs) or nonharmful (κ = 0.77;
agreement = 89%). We analyzed errors/AEs using descriptive statistics and explored
predictors of parent-reported errors using bivariate statistics. We subsequently reviewed
patient medical records to determine the number of parent-reported errors that were
present in the medical record. We obtained demographic/clinical data from hospital
administrative records.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Medical errors and preventable AEs.
RESULTS The mean (SD) age of the 383 parents surveyed was 36.6 (8.9) years; most
respondents (n = 266) were female. Of 383 parents surveyed (81% response rate), 34
parents (8.9%) reported 37 safety incidents. Among these, 62% (n = 23, 6.0 per 100
admissions) were determined to be medical errors on physician review, 24% (n = 9) were
determined to be other quality problems, and 14% (n = 5) were determined to be neither.
Thirty percent (n = 7, 1.8 per 100 admissions) of medical errors caused harm (ie, were
preventable AEs). On bivariate analysis, children with medical errors appeared to have longer
lengths of stay (median [interquartile range], 2.9 days [2.2-6.9] vs 2.5 days [1.9-4.1]; P = .04),
more often had a metabolic (14.3% vs 3.0%; P = .04) or neuromuscular (14.3% vs 3.6%;
P = .05) condition, and more often had an annual household income greater than $100 000
(38.1% vs 30.1%; P = .06) than those without errors. Fifty-seven percent (n = 13) of
parent-reported medical errors were also identified on subsequent medical record review.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Parents frequently reported errors and preventable AEs,
many of which were not otherwise documented in the medical record. Families are an
underused source of data about errors, particularly preventable AEs. Hospitals may wish to
consider incorporating family reports into routine safety surveillance systems.

I
n 1999, the Institute of Medicine estimated that between
44 000 and 98 000 patients die every year in the United
States as a result of medical errors.1 Recent reports sug-
gest that true numbers may be even higher,2 with as many as
400 000 deaths and millions of injuries per year due to harm-
ful errors.3
Medical errors are mistakes in the process of care deliv-
ery, ie, acts of commission or omission that lead to or have sig-
nificant potential for an undesirable outcome.4 Medical er-
rors that cause harm are also known as preventable adverse
events (AEs).4 While most errors do not cause harm, studying
even nonharmful medical errors can provide important in-
sights into error and harm prevention.5 This is particularly true
inpediatrics,ashospitalizedchildrenexperienceratesofmedi-
cal errors similar to those of adults but may experience poten-
tially harmful errors more frequently.6
Error and AE detection methods have greatly advanced
overthepastfewdecades.7-10Medicalrecordreview–basedsur-
veillance methods using trigger tools detect errors and AEs at
more than 10 times the rates of traditional incident-reporting
systems or systems based on reviews of hospital administra-
tive records.9-15 While error and AE detection methods have
progressed, patient and family reports remain notably absent
from most surveillance systems.
Patients and families have the potential to play an impor-
tant role in identifying medical errors and AEs. In one study,
23% of respondents reported that they or someone close to
them had experienced a medical error in the past 5 years.16
Another study found that 20% of patients reported experi-
encingverifiedmedicalerrors.17Afewadultstudieshavefound
that patients identify numerous verified errors and AEs not
otherwise documented in the medical record.18-20 Pediatric
data on patient and family involvement in error and AE de-
tection are limited21-24 but similarly suggest that families of-
tenreportverifiederrorsandAEsthatarenotdetectedthrough
other sources.23
Given the family’
s central role in pediatrics, parent-
reported errors may be a fruitful source of error and AE sur-
veillance for hospitalized children and may provide lessons
regarding the utility of family error reporting in other popu-
lations. Therefore, we examined the rates and predictors of
parent-reported errors and AEs in a cohort of hospitalized
children.
Methods
Data, Setting, and Study Population
We conducted a prospective cohort study of parent-reported
medical errors involving parents of children (aged 0-17 years)
hospitalized in 2 general pediatric units at a tertiary care
children’
s hospital between May 2013 and October 2014,
concurrent with data collection for a study on nighttime
communication.25 We included parents of nonsurgical pa-
tients covered by general pediatric, short-stay (patients with
straightforward illnesses), and subspecialty (eg, adolescent)
teams. We administered written surveys on Monday through
Thursday evenings to parents of a randomly selected subset
of children anticipating discharge within 24 hours. We col-
lected responses that same evening or, if requested by the par-
ent,thefollowingmorning.Weaskedparentstoreportwhether
their child experienced a mistake (ie, an error), any negative
effects from the mistake (ie, a harmful error, also known as a
preventable AE), and details of the incident. We did not ask
parentsaboutnonpreventableAEs(ie,harmsnotresultingfrom
errors). We collected self-reported parent demographic data
and hospital administrative record–based patient clinical/
demographic data. We obtained verbal consent from parents
for participation in the study using an information sheet. The
Boston Children’
s Hospital Institutional Review Board ap-
proved the study.
Exclusions
Given limited interpreter resources, we included only English-
speaking parents. We excluded parents of patients spending
fewer than 2 nights in the unit, “boarding” on the unit await-
inginpatientpsychiatricplacement,instatecustody,or18years
of age or older at admission.
Error Validation and Classification
Two physicians with training in error surveillance and expe-
rience conducting such reviews independently reviewed all
parent-reported safety concerns. They came to consensus
about whether each represented a medical error, a nonsafety-
related quality issue, or neither (κ = 0.64; agreement = 78%)
and classified errors as harmful or nonharmful (ie, near-
misses or errors with little potential for harm; κ = 0.77; agree-
ment = 89%).
We later reviewed patient medical records to determine
the number of parent-reported errors that were documented
in the medical record. We also separately analyzed and
categorized parent concerns by type of error or nonsafety-
related quality issue.
Outcome and Predictors
Our primary outcome was physician-validated, parent-
reported errors. We evaluated the distribution of parent-
reported medical errors by parent and patient age, sex, and
race/ethnicity; parent education, income, and primary lan-
guage; and patient insurance, length of stay, and complex
Key Points
Question: How often do parents of hospitalized children report
safety incidents, and what is the proportion of these that meet
standard definitions of medical errors and preventable adverse
events?
Findings: In this cohort study, 8.9% of parents reported that their
child experienced safety incidents. Most were deemed medical
errors on physician review, and many were not otherwise
documented in the medical record.
Meaning: Parents may be a valuable and complementary source
of data about hospital safety incidents, particularly preventable
adverse events.

chronic condition (CCC) count and category. A marker of medi-
cal complexity, CCCs use International Classification of Dis-
eases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes to identify
medical conditions expected to last 12 or more months that in-
volve several organ systems or one organ system severely
enough to require specialty pediatric care and hospitaliza-
tion at a tertiary care center.26 Age and length of stay re-
mained continuous predictors, while all other variables were
categorized as presented in Table 1 for analysis.
Statistical Analyses
We used descriptive statistics to report rates of parent-
reported errors and preventable AEs. We used percentages
for categorical variables and means (with SDs) for continu-
ous variables. We performed a descriptive analysis to com-
pare parent and patient characteristics for cases in which a
parent reported a medical error vs cases in which a parent
did not report a medical error. To identify factors associated
with parent-reported medical errors, we dichotomized the
sample into cases with 1 or more parent-reported medical
errors and cases with no reported medical errors. To explore
bivariate associations between sociodemographic and clini-
cal factors across the 2 groups, we used the Wilcoxon-Mann-
Whitney U test for differences in average age (for parents
and patients) and the χ2 and Fisher exact tests to assess
differences in remaining categorical variables. A P value
less than .05 was considered statistically significant for
all analyses.
We additionally performed a content analysis with clus-
tering according to theme on text from the open-ended ques-
tion asking parents to explain the type of mistake or harm their
child experienced. Study data were collected and managed
using REDCap (Vanderbilt University).27 Statistical analyses
were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
Results
Sample Characteristics
Overall, 98.9% (N = 471) of eligible parents consented to par-
ticipate in the study. Of these, 383 parents provided re-
sponses about whether their child experienced an error or pre-
ventable AE (81.3% response rate).
On average, parent respondents were approximately 37
years old and predominantly female, white, non-Hispanic, pri-
marily English speaking, and college educated, with an an-
nual household income of $50 000 or more (Table 1). Patients
were on average 6 years old and predominantly nonpubli-
cally insured, male, with no CCCs, and a median length of stay
of 2.6 days (Table 1).
Rates, Types, and Predictors of Parent-Reported Errors
In total, 34 parents (8.9%) reported 37 safety concerns during
their child’
s hospitalization. Of these concerns, 62.2% (n = 23,
6.0 per 100 admissions) were determined to be medical er-
rors on physician review (Figure) and 24.3% (n = 9) were
deemed nonsafety-related quality issues. The remaining con-
cerns (n = 5, 13.5%) were excluded because there was either
no clear error or nonsafety-related quality issue or insuffi-
cient information.
Overall,57%(n = 13)ofparent-reportedmedicalerrorswere
also identified on subsequent medical record review, includ-
ing 2 cases where the medical record indicated that staff would
file an incident report in the hospital’
s voluntary safety re-
porting system. There was no documentation in the medical
record of 43% (n = 10) of parent-reported errors.
Of medical errors, 30.4% (n = 7, 1.8 per 100 admissions)
were deemed harmful (ie, preventable AEs). Errors and pre-
ventable AEs reported by parents were related to diagnosis,
medication, procedure, and other therapy/care. Harmful er-
rors appeared most often to be procedure- or diagnosis-
related errors, while nonharmful errors/near-misses ap-
peared to be predominantly medication related (Table 2).
In unadjusted bivariate analysis, characteristics associ-
ated with a higher likelihood of reporting a medical error in-
cluded longer length of stay and presence of a metabolic CCC
(Table 1). Compared with children whose parents did not re-
port medical errors, children whose parents reported medi-
cal errors had a median (interquartile range) length of stay of
2.9days(2.2-6.9)vs2.5days(1.9-4.1)(P = .04);ametabolicCCC
in 14.3% vs 3.0% of cases (P = .04); a neuromuscular CCC in
14.3% vs 3.6% of cases (P = .05); and an annual household
income greater than $100 000 in 38.1% vs 30.1% of cases
(P = .06).
Narrative Comments
Narrative comments (n = 33) provided by parents in response
to the open-ended item asking them to explain the type of mis-
take or harm their child experienced revealed a spectrum of
errors and nonsafety-related quality concerns (Table 2). Pre-
ventable AEs included delays in diagnosis of a foreign body,
recognition and treatment of urinary retention, and receipt of
pain medication; an intravenous infiltrate; an infection caused
by a prolonged unused intravenous catheter; a staff needle-
stick injury requiring the child to have additional blood drawn
for testing; and an inadequately dressed wound that became
saturated with stool. Nonharmful errors included reading a
magneticresonanceimageincorrectly,informingparentsabout
a procedure intended for another patient, pinning the wrong
limb of a patient down, documenting weight measurements
incorrectly,failingtounclampacatheter,feedingapatientwith
the bottle of a sibling with thrush, and giving salty crackers to
a patient on a salt-restricted diet. Nonharmful medication-
related incidents/near-misses included errors in medication
timing (given too early or too late), dosing (double the dose
given,childaccidentallyadministeredthedose,anddoseomit-
ted), and type (wrong intravenous fluids and wrong medica-
tion documented in medical record).
Parents identified communication problems as contribut-
ing factors in a number of errors. These included communi-
cation between health care professionals (eg, day and night
teams failed to communicate a change in insulin rate), com-
munication between health care professionals and parents (eg,
parent had to request someone 5 times), and written commu-
nication in the medical record (eg, procedure was filed under
the wrong patient).

Nonsafety-related quality issues included issues with care
delivery, hospital environment, communication, experience,
and interpersonal interactions. Excluded incidents included
2 cases involving expected procedural occurrences (blood in
a spinal fluid sample and repeated attempts at a blood draw)
and 1 involving diagnostic uncertainty.
Discussion
We found that 1 in 11 families among a sample of 471 families
in a large children’
s hospital reported that their child experi-
enced a mistake during hospitalization. Most of these events
were validated as medical errors on physician review, yield-
ing a medical error rate of 6.0 per 100 admissions and a pre-
ventable AE rate of 1.8 per 100 admissions. Bivariate predic-
tors of parent-reported errors included length of stay and
presence of certain chronic conditions.
Our finding that approximately 60% of parent-reported
safety concerns were validated on physician review is simi-
lar to adult studies, which have found that 20% to 71% of
patient-reported incidents were confirmed on physician
review to be safety events.19,20 Our error and preventable AE
rates were lower than patient-reported AE rates found in 2
adult studies, which detected AEs in 23% of patients18 and
8.8 per 100 admissions,20 respectively, and are likewise
lower than a Canadian pediatric study that found 28.1 errors
and AEs per 100 admissions.23 It is unclear whether differ-
ences in reported rates are due to differences in data collec-
tion methods, patient populations, or true differences in AE
and error rates across institutions.
When examining predictors of parent-reported errors,
length of stay and the presence of certain CCCs were associ-
ated with higher rates of error. Longer length of stay has pre-
viously been found to be associated with an increased likeli-
hood of experiencing a medical error,28 likely owing to both
increased exposure to the risk of an error and because pa-
tients who experience AEs may consequently have pro-
longed lengths of stay. Children with certain CCCs may be
morelikelytoexperienceerrorsowingtothenumberandcom-
plexity of interventions they experience. In addition, parents
of children with chronic conditions may be more familiar with
the health care system and therefore more comfortable re-
porting an error. Further research is needed to examine the in-
terplay of the myriad factors that could affect error reporting
by parents.
We found that more than half of parent-reported errors
were also documented in the patient’
s medical record. This fig-
ure is similar to studies of patient and parent error reporting,
which found evidence of between 5% and 55% of parent-
reported AEs and safety incidents in the medical record.18,20

While our study did not directly compare rates of family-
reported errors with those detected through systematic sur-
veillance, a recent study we conducted in the same units using
asystematicactivesurveillancemethodologyidentified1.5pre-
ventable AEs per 100 admissions,29 similar to the rate of 1.8
preventable AEs per 100 admissions we identified in the cur-
rent study. Although the total rate of parent-reported errors
in the current study was about one-third of that detected using
systematic active error surveillance in our prior study, the pre-
ventable AE rate was comparable in both studies. This sug-
gests that while parent reports may be a less sensitive means
of detecting nonharmful errors—perhaps because these er-
rors are often not discussed with or witnessed by parents or
because these errors require more sophisticated medical
knowledge to identify—parents may be more reliable report-
ers of harmful errors.
As systematic medical record surveillance methods have
progressed, they have become more sensitive and reliable, de-
tecting AEs at 10-fold higher rates than administrative screen-
ing tools and voluntary hospital reporting systems.2,7,9-15
However, patient and family reports have remained notably
underusedasameansofdetectingerrorsandharms.Ourstudy
suggests that while parents may not be aware of most errors
that occur and may often report incidents that are nonsafety-
related quality issues rather than errors, parents appear to pro-
vide complementary information that allows a richer under-
standing of safety events.
Additionally, even parent concerns that are not strictly
safety related may provide useful information that can im-
prove the quality and safety of care provided. The discrep-
ancy between what parents and physicians deemed medical
errors and AEs might relate to different thresholds of report-
ing, priorities, definitions, and medical knowledge, among
other factors. Regardless, these results suggest that further
communication between parents and physicians and nurses
around safety may be beneficial.
Ultimately, while family error reporting should not re-
place active surveillance, hospitals may wish to consider more
actively involving families in the surveillance process. Fam-
ily members can be crucial partners not only in reporting but
also in ensuring the safety of hospitalized patients. Parents are
frequently at their child’
s bedside and are typically actively en-
gaged in their child’
s care, both inside and outside the hospi-
tal.Athome,theyareoftenresponsibleforadministeringmedi-
cations and typically have intimate knowledge of their child’
s
doses and allergies. A parent who notices a nurse drawing up
alargervolumeofamedicationthanthechildreceivesathome,
for instance, may be able to intercept a potential overdose.
However, in order for parents to be effective partners in
error and harm prevention, they need to be well-informed
about care plans, kept up-to-date as changes are made, and en-
couraged to participate and speak up. One approach is to in-
struct all parents on how to report potential errors; the inclu-
sion of an item asking parents whether they were informed of
thehospital’
serror-reportingprocessintheChildHospitalCon-
sumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems
survey30 may prompt more hospitals to systematically pro-
vide such information to all families. By priming parents to pay
attention to safety, hospitals may be able to engage them to
help identify errors and perhaps even mitigate those that are
potentially harmful.
Prior research has shown that patients are interested in en-
gaging more in safety efforts31-33 and that physicians, nurses,
and other health care professionals support increasing such
patient involvement.31,32 However, interpersonal, intraper-
sonal,andculturalbarrierstopatientinvolvementinsafetyini-
tiatives exist.34 For instance, patients appear to be less com-
fortable with safety efforts that require them to engage in what
they perceive as challenging behaviors (eg, notifying physi-
cians/nurses of errors) and conversely more comfortable with
efforts that involve nonchallenging behaviors (eg, reporting an
error to a reporting system).35 These differences may result
from parent perceptions of hierarchy and power differentials
inthemedicalsystem,aswellasotherfactors,butmustbecon-
sidered when designing safety interventions involving pa-
tients and families. Involvement in a nonchallenging system,
such as the one we established in our study, may provide a
means to actively involve parents in safety promotion with-
out placing them in a position where they feel compelled to
interact in a confrontational manner with the health care pro-
fessionals caring for their child.
Communication failures are a leading cause of sentinel
events,1 and communication is known to affect safety.36,37 In-
terestingly, the families in our study seemed to recognize the
link between communication and safety, as many explicitly
mentioned communication failures as a contributing factor to
their reported safety incidents. Strategies to improve miscom-
munications among physicians have been shown to decrease
errors and AEs.29,38-40 The effect on patient safety of improv-
ing communication between health care professionals and
families is an unexplored area ripe for future research.

Our study had a number of limitations. It was a single-
center study conducted in a tertiary care pediatric hospital on
predominantly female, well-educated, higher-income par-
ents of children admitted for 2 or more nights. All of these fac-
torslimitgeneralizability.Additionally,wewerenotabletocap-
ture error and AE rates for children of non-English–speaking
parents. Such children may be particularly prone to errors,41
making parent-reported error and AE rates potentially even
higher than those we detected. Moreover, we did not ask par-
ents about nonpreventable AEs, so our AE rate does not cap-
ture this subset of AEs. Validation of errors and AEs is not a
precise science, although we had 2 physician reviewers reach
consensus and subsequently reviewed patient medical rec-
ords for additional information. Finally, although our study
suggested some direction for future inquiry, we lacked the sta-
tistical power to do a robust analysis of predictors of parent-
reported errors. These are all areas of future study.
Conclusions
Parents appear to be a valuable but underused source of data
about hospital safety incidents, particularly preventable AEs.
Parent-reported preventable AE rates may be similar to those
detected through medical record review–based active surveil-
lancemethods.Hospitalsmaywishtoconsiderpartneringmore
actively with patients and families in their efforts to detect er-
rors and improve the safety and quality of care.
