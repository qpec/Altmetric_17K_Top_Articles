Abstract
Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the 
pediatric, elderly, and immune compromised populations1,2. A gap in our understanding of hRSV 
disease pathology is the interplay between virally encoded immune antagonists and host 
components that limit hRSV replication. hRSV encodes for non-structural (NS) proteins that are 
important immune antagonists3–6; however, the role of these proteins in viral pathogenesis is 
incompletely understood. Here we report the crystal structure of hRSV NS1 protein, which 
suggests that NS1 is a structural paralog of hRSV matrix (M) protein. Comparative analysis of the 
shared structural fold with M revealed regions unique to NS1. Studies on NS1 WT or mutant alone

 or in recombinant RSVs demonstrate that structural regions unique to NS1 contribute to 
modulation of host responses, including inhibition of type I IFN responses, suppression of 
dendritic cell maturation, and promotion of inflammatory responses. Transcriptional profiles of 
A549 cells infected with recombinant RSVs show significant differences in multiple host 
pathways, suggesting that NS1 may have a greater role in regulating host responses than 
previously appreciated. These results provide a framework to target NS1 for therapeutic 
development to limit hRSV associated morbidity and mortality.
Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) is a major cause of severe respiratory infections 
in children and a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality for the elderly and 
immune-compromised individuals. The virus causes 130,000 cases of clinical infection in 
children less than 5 years of age in the United States alone1,2. Currently we lack sufficient 
knowledge and understanding of several outcomes that are observed during hRSV 
infections, including complications arising from partial immunity to hRSV infections, 
reduced immune responses in infants with maternal antibodies, and vaccine enhancement of 
disease7. We also lack a complete view of host-viral interactions that occur in response to 
hRSV infection8. As a consequence, limited effective prophylactic or therapeutic approaches 
are currently available to attenuate hRSV infections9.
hRSV is a member of the Pneumoviridae family and its genome encodes for 11 proteins 
(Supplementary Fig. 1a), including the non-structural proteins 1 (NS1) and 2 (NS2). hRSV 
NS1 and NS2 are multifunctional proteins that are important for host immune evasion. 
Sequence analysis of NS1 and NS2 shows that there are no counterparts for NS1 and NS2 in 
other non-segmented negative strand RNA viruses except for other members of the 
Orthopneumovirus genus (bovine RSV, ovine RSV, and pneumonia virus of mice) (Fig. 2). 
This observation highlights a unique evolutionary path taken by hRSV to achieve effective 
immune suppression. Functionally, NS1 has been implicated as an antagonist of type I IFN 
responses3–6. NS1 has been shown to inhibit IRF3/7 dependent gene expression6,10,11 and is 
involved in STAT2 degradation through a proteosome mediated process12. NS1 may serve as 
a specificity factor for the cullin-ring family of E3 ubiquitin ligases13,14. NS1 may also 
function as an inhibitor of dendritic cell (DC) maturation15,16 as an inhibitor of CD103+ 
CD8+ T-cells and Th17 cell proliferation, and as a stimulator of Th2 cells, which can all 
enhance disease severity15–17. Furthermore, NS1, in concert with NS2, is thought to inhibit 
DC maturation and T-cell responses through defects in the immunological synapse 
formation in infected cells18–20. However, it is not clear if these effects are solely due to 
suppression of type I IFNs or additional direct targeting of the host signaling pathways by 
NS1, including the disruption of multiple host gene expression programs as previously 
implicated21,22. Thus, the basis for these host-viral interactions mediated by hRSV NS1 that 
contributes dysregulation of host functions during infections remains incompletely defined.
To better understand the molecular basis for NS1-associated function, we solved the 
structure of hRSV NS1 to 2.22 Å resolution by X-ray crystallography using 
selenomethionine single wavelength anomalous dispersion (Se-SAD) (Supplementary Table 
1). In the crystal, there are two molecules in the asymmetric unit (termed molecule A and 
molecule B) (Fig. 2a). Analysis of the crystal packing revealed that the C-terminal helix of

 one molecule is positioned against the beta strands of the second molecule. However, there 
is no significant surface area buried between the two molecules to support a true dimer 
interface. Consistent with this structural observation, hydrodynamic studies by size 
exclusion chromatography-multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) analysis reveals that 
NS1 is 17.5 ± 2.1 kDa in solution under physiological salt conditions (Supplementary Fig. 
2a), suggesting that the predominant form of NS1 may be the monomer. The NS1 monomer 
is comprised of a β-sandwich flanked by three α-helices. Three β-strands are arranged in 
two orthogonal sheets to form the beta-sandwich, with a seventh beta strand β6 that runs 
antiparallel to β3 before twisting to run antiparallel to β1 (Fig. 2b). All the strands in the β-
sandwich are antiparallel except β7, which forms a strand parallel to β4 (Fig. 2c). The two 
β-sheets are connected by a flexible linker (residues 99-108) for which little density is 
observed, suggesting that there is increased flexibility in this region. Helices α1 and α2 are 
arranged to one side of the β-sandwich whereas alpha helix α3 is extended from the core of 
the protein (Fig. 2b–c).
Comparisons of the hRSV NS1 structure to available structures in the Protein Data Bank 
(PDB) using the DALI server yielded a list of several viral matrix proteins, including hRSV 
matrix (M) protein (Z score 6.5; Supplementary Fig. 2b)23, the Ebola virus matrix protein 
VP40 (Z score 6.8)24, and Newcastle Disease virus matrix protein (Z score 5)25 (Table S2). 
Structural alignment of hRSV NS1 with the N-terminal domains of hRSV M protein (PDB: 
2VQP; Fig. 2d–f) and Ebola virus VP40 (PDB: 1ES6) displayed remarkable alignment of 
the structures (backbone RMSD 3.78 Å over 96 residues and 4.15 Å over 88 residues, 
respectively). However, hRSV NS1 displays less resemblance to the matrix proteins of other 
non-segmented negative strand RNA viruses, such as Borna Disease virus and vesicular 
stomatitis virus (PDB 3F1J and 1LG7, respectively)26,27. Despite the structural similarities, 
the lack of sequence homology between hRSV NS1 and different Mononegavirales matrix 
(M) proteins suggest that the functional significance correlates with the structural fold and 
not the primary sequence. Based on our finding, it is tempting to speculate that a duplication 
event of the N-terminal domain of M followed by divergent evolution resulted in the current 
NS1 proteins (Fig. 2b). In contrast to the sequence similarity between hRSV NS1 and M, 
Mononegavirales M proteins share significant sequence and structural similarities and are 
thus considered homologs (Supplementary Fig. 1c)23. Collectively, these observations 
suggest that hRSV NS1 may be a paralog of hRSV M protein although convergent evolution 
cannot be ruled out.
While the structural similarities are striking, structural differences between hRSV NS1 and 
M can potentially reveal unique features of hRSV NS1 that contribute to NS1-specific 
functions, including immune suppressive functions. First, hRSV NS1 is comprised of a 
single domain whereas there are two domains with similar folds in the hRSV M protein 
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Second, a change in β-strand direction of NS1 β4 and β7 to parallel, 
which is similar to hRSV M β1 and β8, is absent in other M proteins (Fig. 2c–d & Fig. 2f–
h). Third, there is an insertion of β5 strand and α3 helix in the hRSV NS1 structure, the 
functional significance of which are unknown. High sequence conservation among RSV 
sequences suggest that the helix α3 itself may be important for protein stability or a 
potential hotspot for intermolecular interactions that are required for hRSV NS1 function. 
Furthermore, comparison of the electrostatic surface potential reveals that hRSV NS1 lacks

 the extensive positively charged surface (Fig. 2e–g) that is present in full length hRSV M 
proteins23,28, which correspond to membrane associated functions23.
In order to test the importance of specific residues and helix α3 of NS1, which is a 
secondary structural element absent in M, and its role in hRSV mediated host immune 
evasion, we calculated the solvent accessible surface area (ASA) of NS1 with and without 
the terminal α3 helix and of the α3 helix alone (Fig. 3a). Results from the ASA calculations 
show that a large number of hydrophobic residues on the α3 helix are solvent accessible in 
the absence of the rest of the NS1 structure, suggesting that these residues may be involved 
in intra-protein interfacial interactions. Atomistic computer simulations indicate that the α3 
helix is stable and likely displays cooperative folding, with higher stability of α3 helix in the 
context of the NS1 structure rather than the isolated helix (Fig. 3b–c). A subset of the 
interface residues between α3 helix and the rest of the NS1 structure and a α3 helix 
truncation mutants were generated and characterized by biochemical and functional assays 
in order to assess a functional role for α3 helix in NS1-mediated functions (Fig. 3d). Using 
circular dichroism (CD), we confirmed that the mutations Y125A, L132A/L133A, and 1-118 
did not compromise the overall stability of the proteins (Fig. 3e–f). Deletion of the α3 helix 
in the NS1 1-118 construct reduced helical content, as expected, and but did not affect the 
overall stability of the protein in thermal measurements (Supplementary Fig. 2b–c). Overall, 
our analyses suggest that the α3 helix of NS1 is an important structural element that may 
also directly facilitate function.
Previous studies have shown that the non-structural proteins NS1 and NS2 play unique roles 
in hRSV mediated host immune evasion as inhibitors of IFN responses. To test inhibition of 
IFN responses, we measured activation of the IFN-β promoter during infection with non-NS 
protein containing Sendai virus (SeV). Transfection of WT hRSV NS1 significantly inhibits 
the IFN-β response to levels similar to those observed for Ebola virus VP35 (eVP35), a 
well-characterized IFN antagonist (Fig. 3g). Furthermore, hRSV NS1 partially suppresses 
activation of IFN-β mediated by IRF3-5D, a constitutively activated phosphomimic of the 
transcription factor IRF3, suggesting that hRSV NS1 may function at multiple points of the 
IFN-β signaling pathway, including a nuclear function (Supplementary Fig. 2d). Mutation of 
residues Y125 and L132/L133 in the α3 helix or truncation of the α3 helix (1-118 construct) 
impacted the NS1 function. In contrast, mutation of residues F17 and F56 display near-
wildtype inhibition of IFN-β promoter activity. Altogether, these results suggesting that 
Y125 and L132/L133 residues as well as the α3 helix may play a critical role in NS1-
mediated IFN antagonism, whereas F15 and G56 residues outside of α3 helix do not.
Studies of mutant RSVs implicate NS1 as a suppressor of DC maturation. We sought to 
determine whether NS1 expression is sufficient to suppress DC maturation in response to 
RNA virus infection and to assess the functional relevance of the α3 helix and α3 helix 
proximal residues in the NS1 structure in DC suppression. Lentiviruses encoding hRSV NS1 
mutations were generated and human monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs) were transduced 
with control (empty and eVP35), NS1 WT, or NS1 L132A/L133A mutant. Transduced DCs 
were then mock-infected or infected with SeV in order to stimulate maturation. Relative to 
SeV-infected empty vector controls, WT NS1 suppressed IFN-β, cytokine (TNF-α) and 
representative IFN stimulated gene upregulation, whereas the L132A/L133A mutant was

 impaired for this suppression (Fig. 4a–d). Further, WT NS1 impaired the upregulation of cell 
surface markers of DC maturation, as assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. 4e–h). These 
observations further support a role for NS1 α3 helix as an important determinant in innate 
immune modulation.
RSV infections are characterized by airway inflammation and excess mucus production, and 
excessive cytokine production likely driven by Th2 cytokines29. To establish the structural 
basis for NS1-unique regions in promoting virus replication and inducing responses 
characteristic of hRSV disease, we generated recombinant RSV viruses (rRSVs) encoding 
NS1 WT or 1-118, L132A/L133A, or Y125A mutations. Each of these rRSVs mutants 
displayed similar syncytia formation in type I IFN-deficient Vero cells (Supplementary Fig. 
3), indicating that the mutations had no effect on the capacity for viral replication in the 
absence of innate antiviral responses. In contrast, we observed an approximately two order 
of magnitude decrease in replication rates of rRSV mutants in IFN competent A549 cells 
compared to Vero cells (Fig. 4i). Corresponding RNA-seq studies using cells infected with 
mock, rRSV WT, or rRSV containing NS1 mutants (1-118, L132A/L133A, or Y125A) at 
low multiplicity of infection (MOI=0.01), revealed that WT rRSV infections result in higher 
levels of viral RNA relative to mock or rRSV containing NS1 mutant infected cells, whereas 
accumulation of mutant viral RNAs were significantly reduced even at 12 and 24 hpi 
(Supplementary Fig. 4a–b). This result supports other data that NS1 mutant viruses exhibit 
substantially attenuated replication in IFN competent cells and that the observed attenuation 
is linked to the function of NS1-unique regions of hRSV5,30. Next, analysis of differential 
gene expression (DGEs) between mock and WT revealed a significant upregulation of 
inflammatory and IFN pathways in cells infected with WT rRSV (Fig. 4j). Importantly, data 
at 96 hpi suggest that overall DGEs between mock and mutant rRSVs (118, L132A/L133A, 
or Y125A) appear significantly different from WT rRSV infected samples (Fig. 4j). In 
addition to direct comparison of DGEs, we identified the top 25 up- and down-regulated 
genes for WT and mutant rRSVs relative to mock infections and the resulting data also 
highlight significant differences between gene expression in cells infected with WT rRSV 
compared to cells infected with mutant rRSVs (Supplementary Fig. 5a–d). Further 
examination of the RNA-seq results suggests that key signaling pathways such as IFN 
induction (Fig 4k left panel & Supplementary Fig. 6), IFN response (Fig. 4k middle panel & 
Supplementary Fig. 7), and oxidative stress signaling pathways (Fig. 4k right panel & 
Supplementary Fig. 8) are all differentially expressed with significantly higher DGEs 
reported for WT rRSV infection. These observations regarding gene expression differences 
are consistent with previous studies of hRSV NS131,32 and our results suggest that these 
differences are likely due to a direct role for NS1-mediated global regulation of host gene 
expression. Because the viral loads at 96 hpi were higher for WT rRSV than compared to 
mutant rRSVs, it is possible that the differences in DGEs are due to differences in viral 
replication. Therefore, we also infected A549 cells with WT and mutant rRSVs and 
examined RNA-seq results for 12 and 24 hpi, which support viral infection for early time 
points as comparable viral transcripts are present for WT and mutant rRSVs (see 
Supplementary Fig. 4b). Furthermore, examination of the transcriptomic data for earlier 
timepoints (12, 24, and 48 hpi) reveal similar overall expression patterns in the IFN 
induction (Supplementary Fig. 9), IFN response (Supplementary Fig. 10), and oxidative

 stress signaling pathways (Supplementary Fig. 11) among the WT and mutant rRSV infected 
cells at 12 and 24 hpi, but higher DGEs in these signaling pathways for WT rRSV infection 
starting at 48 hpi.
Together, our data support a model wherein hRSV NS1-specific regions of (i.e. those areas 
that do not share structural features) that are distinct from those in RSV M protein, directly 
target critical components in order to modulating immune signaling pathways, leading to 
productive viral infection. Owing to the limited encoding capacity and cytosolic viral 
replication, many negative sense RNA viruses have potent counter mechanisms to host 
immune responses. Our studies of hRSV NS1 structure reveal that hRSV NS1 uses similar 
secondary and tertiary structural elements as the N-terminal domain of the hRSV M protein 
and is suggestive that this protein likely evolved as a structural paralog. Given the significant 
involvement of the hRSV NS1-unique regions as an important regulator of host gene 
expression, these NS1-unique regions also present previously unrecognized opportunities for 
development of hRSV therapies, including the potential to use helix α3 mutants as a means 
to attenuate hRSV. Such mutants may provide a mechanism of attenuation that are different 
from currently available attenuated viruses, including those with gene deletions of M2-2 or 
NS2 in clinical trials33. Moreover, such viruses may be used in parallel or in conjunction to 
elicit non-redundant host responses that may be beneficial for understanding confounding 
factors during RSV infections. Importantly, our studies point to a significant divergence of 
hRSV from other Pneumoviridae family members as well as from the larger non-segmented 
negative strand RNA viruses that resulted in the acquisition of NS1 and potentially NS2 
open reading frames. Our findings also raise the possibility that the M protein in related 
family members may compensate for the lack of NS1 by utilizing their M protein to 
modulate host gene expression during viral infection. Future studies that address these 
questions may provide insights into the specific molecular mechanisms that are at play 
during hRSV infections, which is human pathogen with significant impact on a subset of the 
human population.
Methods
Cloning, expression, and purification
Full-length and mutant human respiratory syncytial virus non-structural 1 (NS1) proteins 
were subcloned into a modified pET15b vector (Novagen). Mutations in the resulting 
vectors were verified by sequencing prior to use. NS1 proteins were expressed in 
BL21(DE3) E. coli cells, harvested by centrifugation at 30,000 × g, and lysed using an 
Emulsiflex-C5 homogenizer (Avestin). NS1 proteins were purified using a series of 
chromatographic columns followed by a final purification step using a Superdex 75 16/60 
column (GE Healthcare) into buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 NaCl, and 2 mM 
TCEP. Selenomethionine-labeled NS1 was expressed and purified using protocols similar to 
those used for the native protein.
IFN-β promoter assay
IFN-β promoter reporter gene activity was measured in the presence of NS1 mutants 
following infection with Sendai virus (SeV), as indicated. IFN-β-firefly luciferase activities

 were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity expressed from a cotransfected constitutive 
expression plasmid. % Activity was determined by setting vector with SeV as 100%. The 
error bars indicate standard deviation of three independent replicates.
Culturing, infection, and flow cytometry analysis of MDDCs
Human MDDCs were purified from blood purchased from New York Blood Center that has 
been collected from healthy anonymous human blood donors. The human MDDCs were 
generated from CD14 cells purified from concentrated leukocytes of healthy human donors 
as described previously31. The MDDCs were incubated at 37°C for 5 days in DC medium 
(RPMI containing 4% human AB serum [Fisher Scientific], 2 mM L-glutamine 1 mM 
sodium pyruvate, 100 U/ml penicillin–100 g/ml streptomycin, and 55 uM b-
mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 500 U/ml human granulocyte-macrophage colony-
stimulating factor (hGM-CSF; PeproTech) and 500 U/ml human interleukin-4 (hIL-4; 
PeproTech). Typically, we obtained approximately 107 MDDCs per 20 ml of culture. 
MDDCs were transduced by spinoculation at 1,850 rpm with lentiviruses expressing 
respective proteins (wt-eVP35, NS1-wt, NS1 1-118, L132A/L133A) for 2.5 h and then 
cultured in fresh medium for 72 h. Transduced MDDCs were then treated with sendai virus 
(30 HA units/ml) for 20h and the RNA from the MDDCs were harvested to assess gene 
expression by qPCR at the indicated timepoints. Alternatively, MDDCs were harvested and 
stained for cell surface expression of multiple markers of DC maturation by flow cytometry 
at 20 h after SeV infection. DCs were pelleted and resuspended in fluorescence-activated 
cell sorting buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% 
sodium azide) and then incubated for 30 min on ice in the dark with the antibodies. 
Antibodies, including anti-CD40-PE, anti-CD80-PE, anti-CD83-PE, and anti-CD86-PE, 
were purchased from eBioscience. Flow cytometry data were collected using an LSR II flow 
cytometer (BD Bioscience) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).
Crystallization and diffraction data collection
Initial conditions for crystallization were identified using commercially available screens 
(Hampton Research) and subsequently optimized using in-house generated reagents. 
Diffraction data was collected at the Advanced Light Source (Beamline 4.2.2; Berkeley, CA) 
and at the Argonne National Laboratory (sector 19; Argonne, IL) at 100 K.
Structure determination, refinement, and figure generation
X-ray data were collected at the Structural Biology Center 19ID at the Advanced Photon 
Source (Argonne, IL). Data from a crystal of SeMet derivatized NS1 protein was collected at 
low remote energy to minimize radiation damage with an oscillation angle of 1 and a 
crystal-to-detector distance of 280 mm. Data were processed using HKL300034,35. The data 
statistics are presented in Table S1. Heavy atom positions were identified by ShelxD36, 
which identified 14 Se positions. Phasing was carried out by MLPHARE37 as implemented 
in HKL3000, which was followed by phase refinement and by density modification (solvent 
flattening) using DM38. Model building was carried out with ARP/wARP39,40 and 
Buccaneer41 with visual inspection with Coot42. Final refinement was carried out with 
Refmac43,44. Local NCS restraints, jelly body refinement, and in the later cycles with TLS 
refinement45. Structure quality was assessed with MolProbity46. Surface area was calculated

 using AREAIMOL as implemented in CCP4 program suite47. Structural alignment and 
structure figures were prepared using PyMOL48. Topology diagrams were generated by 
PDBSum49,50 and TopDraw51. Sequence alignment was performed using ClustalW52 and 
prepared using ESPript 3.053.
CD experiments
Circular dichroism (CD) wavelength scans were performed using a Chirascan CD 
spectrometer (Applied Photophysics). The change in molar ellipticity of each protein was 
monitored from 10 to 90 °C on samples containing 5–10 μM of NS1 WT and mutant 
proteins.
SEC-MALS
SEC-MALS experiments were performed using a DAWN-HELEOS II detector (Wyatt 
Technologies) coupled to a Superdex SD200 column (GE Healthcare) in buffer containing 
10 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM TCEP. 2 mg/ml sample was injected and raw data 
were analyzed using ASTRA 6 software (Wyatt Technologies) to determine the weight 
averaged molecular mass (MW). Protein concentrations were determined using the refractive 
index measured by an Optilab T-rEX (Wyatt Technologies) and a dn/dc = 0.185 ml3 g−1.
Cells, viruses
hRSV strain A2, line 19F was recovered using a reverse genetic system provided54 through 
BEI Resources, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of 
Health. 293T (ATCC CRL 3216), Hep2 (ATCC CCL-23), A549 (ATCC CCL-185), and 
VeroE6 (ATCC CRL-1586) cell lines were obtained from ATCC and were not further 
aunthenticated. Cells were negative for mycoplasma contamination using LookOut 
Mycoplasma PCR Detection Kit (Sigma) or MycoAlert kit (Lonza). Cells were maintained 
in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal 
bovine serum.
Generation hRSV A2, line19F and hRSV NS1 mutants
A plasmid containing the full length genome sequence of hRSV A2, line 19F was generated 
from plasmid A2-mKate2-line19F by elimination of the Kate2 gene by using the BlpI 
restriction site54. All other fragments were relegated and the integrity and size of the 
obtained full length genome plasmid was verified with BlpI and several other restriction 
enzymes. Mutations were introduced into the NS1 gene by PCR amplification of the C-
terminal end using oligonucleotides that contained corresponding mutations (Y125A, 
L132A/L133A) and a deletion mutant (1-118). PCR fragments with corresponding 
mutations were cloned in a shuttle plasmid. A plasmid clone with the correct sequence was 
identified by nucleotide sequencing and the fragment containing the part of NS1 with the 
corresponding mutation was returned into the full length genome plasmid. The NS1 gene in 
the final plasmid was sequenced again to verify the sequence of introduced mutations.

 Virus recovery
Transfections were conducted as described previously4. Briefly, sub-confluent BHK-21/
SinRep19-T7 cells constitutively expressing T7 polymerase from a Sindbis virus replicon 
were transfected with 5μg of antigenomic F-L plasmids (19F, 125, 132/133, Δ118) and four 
support plasmids (2 μg pN, 2 μg pP, 1 μg pM2-1, and 1 μg pL) that express hRSV N, P, M2 
and L proteins under the control of the T7 promoter. Transfection was conducted using 
FuGENE 6 (Roche) in DMEM with 2% FBS in accordance with manufacturer’s 
instructions. After overnight incubation with transfection mixture, the medium was replaced 
with fresh DMEM 2%FBS. Transfected cells were split every 4–5 days until syncytia 
became visible, then the cells and medium were harvested and homogenized, and clarified 
supernatant was used for infection of Hep2 (wildtype virus) or VeroE6 cells (mutant 
viruses).
Virus titers were determined by plaque assay for 6 days in VeroE6 cells under 0.8% agarose 
followed by fixation with 10% paraformaldehyde. Plaques were developed by incubation of 
cells with biotinylated goat anti-RSV antibodies (Fitzerald) followed by VectastainABC-AK 
5000 kit and alkaline phosphatase substrate kit VectorRed-SK-5100 (Vector Laboratories).
Growth curve
A subconfluent monolayer of A549 and VeroE6 cells was infected in triplicate with hRSV 
A2 line 19F (wildtype) and three mutants with multiplicity of infection (MOI) 0.1 in a 12 
well plate. After 1h of adsorption, infected cells were washed three times with DPBS and 
DMEM with 2% FBS. Medium was harvested at 2, 48, 72, and 96 hours post infection and 
clarified by centrifugation. RNA was isolated from medium using Qiagen Viral RNA Mini 
Kit and hRSV titer was determined by qPCR and expressed as fold change compared to 2 
hour time point.
Virus-specific real-time qPCR (RT-qPCR)
Quantitative qPCR was conducted by using TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mixture 
(Applied Biosystem) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The primers and probes 
for the hRSV large (L) polymerase gene (forward primer, 5′-
TCCCTACGGTTGTGATCGATAGA -3′; reverse primer, 5′-
TGATGGGAAGTAGTAGTGTAAAGTTGGT -3′; MGB-probe, 5′-(FAM)- 
AGGTAATACAGCCAAATC - nonfluorescent quencher (NFQ) on the 3′ end) were 
obtained from Applied Biosystem. Standard to quantitate virus specific RNA was plasmid 
DNA with cloned portion of L gene.
RNA sequencing
mRNA was prepared using Dynabeads mRNA kit (Invitrogen) and fragmented by heat. For 
cDNA synthesis, custom oligo-dT primers were used with a barcode and an adapter-linker 
sequence (CAG ACG TGT GCT CTT CCG ATC T—XXXXXXXX-T15) and with the 
Affinity Script enzyme (Agilent). After first strand synthesis, samples were pooled together 
based on ACTB qPCR values. RNA-DNA hybrids was degraded using consecutive acid-
alkali treatment. A second sequencing linker (AGA TCG GAA GAG CGT CGT GTAG) was 
then ligated using T4 ligase (NEB). The mixture was then PCR enriched for 12 cycles and

 purified to yield final strand specific RNA-seq libraries as previously described55. Libraries 
were sequenced using a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina) using 50bp × 25bp pair-end sequencing.
RNA-seq analysis
Fastq files for each sample were aligned to hg38 genome (Release 23 Gencode, GRCh38.p3) 
using STAR56. Each sample was evaluated according to a variety of both pre- and post-
alignment QC measures with Picard tools. To assess batch effects in data set we used 
hierarchical clustering (average linkage algorithm with 1 minus the Pearson correlation 
coefficient as the dissimilarity measure) and principal component analysis. Aligned reads 
were quantified using quant3p script (github.com/ctlab/quant3p) to account for specifics of 
3′ sequencing: higher dependency on good 3′ annotation and lower level of sequence 
specificity close to 3′ end. Actual read contings were carried out by HTSeq57 with enriched 
genome annotation and alignment with fixed multimapper flags.
For analysis, two or three replicates from each condition were used, due to presence of 
outliers for some conditions. Performed PCA (Fig. S12) supports the ability to use either 
two or three replicates. Undetected genes (number of matching reads < 5 across all samples) 
were excluded. DESeq258 was used for analysis of differential gene expression. Pre-ranked 
GSEA59 was used to identify pathway enrichments.

a, Accessible surface area (ASA) analysis of NS1 residues 1-118 and 119-139 using 
Areaimol60 with a search probe radius used of 1.4Å. Increase in ASA of NS1 residues 1-118 
in the absence of the C-terminal α3 helix is plotted (left). ASA for NS1 residues 1-118 
within chain A and B of the crystal structure was calculated in the presence and absence of 
the helix α3 (119-139). The average of the ASA values of chains A and B were considered. 
The increase in ASA was calculated by subtracting the average ASA in the absence of helix 
α3 from that in the presence of α3 helix. For residues 119 to 139 within helix α3 (right), the 
increase in ASA was calculated in the presence and absence of the rest of the polypeptide

 Figure 4. NS1 unique regions are important for modulating host responses
Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) were transduced with either only empty 
lentiviral vectors (empty) or lentivirus vectors that express either EBOV-VP35, hRSV-NS1, 
hRSV-NS1-(1-118), hRSV-NS1-L132A/L133A. RNA was isolated from transduced MDDCs
