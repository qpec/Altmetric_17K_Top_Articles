ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
To assess the effectiveness of a school and 
family based healthy lifestyle programme (WAVES 
intervention) compared with usual practice, in 
preventing childhood obesity.
DESIGN
Cluster randomised controlled trial.
SETTING
UK primary schools from the West Midlands.
PARTICIPANTS
200 schools were randomly selected from all state run 
primary schools within 35 miles of the study centre 
(n=980), oversampling those with high minority 
ethnic populations. These schools were randomly 
ordered and sequentially invited to participate. 
144 eligible schools were approached to achieve 
the target recruitment of 54 schools. After baseline 
measurements 1467 year 1 pupils aged 5 and 6 years 
(control: 28 schools, 778 pupils) were randomised, 
using a blocked balancing algorithm. 53 schools 
remained in the trial and data on 1287 (87.7%) and 
1169 (79.7%) pupils were available at first follow-
up (15 month) and second follow-up (30 month), 
respectively.
INTERVENTIONS
The 12 month intervention encouraged healthy eating 
and physical activity, including a daily additional 30 
minute school time physical activity opportunity, a six 
week interactive skill based programme in conjunction 
with Aston Villa football club, signposting of local 
family physical activity opportunities through mail-
outs every six months, and termly school led family 
workshops on healthy cooking skills.
OUTCOME MEASURES
The protocol defined primary outcomes, assessed 
blind to allocation, were between arm difference in 
body mass index (BMI) z score at 15 and 30 months. 
Secondary outcomes were further anthropometric, 
dietary, physical activity, and psychological 
measurements, and difference in BMI z score at 39 
months in a subset.
RESULTS
Data for primary outcome analyses were: baseline, 54 
schools: 1392 pupils (732 controls); first follow-up 
(15 months post-baseline), 53 schools: 1249 pupils 
(675 controls); second follow-up (30 months post-
baseline), 53 schools: 1145 pupils (621 controls). The 
mean BMI z score was non-significantly lower in the 
intervention arm compared with the control arm at 15 
months (mean difference −0.075 (95% confidence 
interval −0.183 to 0.033, P=0.18) in the baseline 
adjusted models. At 30 months the mean difference 
was −0.027 (−0.137 to 0.083, P=0.63). There was 
no statistically significant difference between groups 
for other anthropometric, dietary, physical activity, or 
psychological measurements (including assessment 
of harm).
CONCLUSIONS
The primary analyses suggest that this experiential 
focused intervention had no statistically significant 
effect on BMI z score or on preventing childhood 
obesity. Schools are unlikely to impact on the 
childhood obesity epidemic by incorporating such 
interventions without wider support across multiple 
sectors and environments.

Introduction
Excess weight in childhood is a global problem, 
affecting around 41 million children under the age 
of 5 years.1 In addition to physical and psychosocial 
health consequences in these early years, childhood

WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Comprehensive systematic reviews have suggested that school based 
interventions could be effective in preventing childhood obesity in high income 
countries
Heterogeneity in intervention components and outcomes limit practical 
recommendations
Furthermore, inconsistent findings in relation to differential effects on 
subgroups, and impact on inequalities, limited data on potential harms, process 
measures, and long term effects, as well as lack of data on cost effectiveness, 
restrict interpretation and wider applicability
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
The WAVES study evaluated a theoretically informed, skills based intervention 
targeting children’s diet and physical activity behaviours through schools and 
families
It did not result in any meaningful effect on adiposity, dietary intake, or physical 
activity after 15 or 30 months
Although such interventions can fulfil the responsibility of schools for wider 
education, without upstream support they are unlikely to halt the childhood 
obesity epidemic

excess weight is an important predictor of obesity 
in adulthood,2 with additional adverse health and 
economic3 effects. In the UK around a quarter of 
children have excess weight at school entry (age 4 or 
5 years).4 The proportion of very overweight children 
doubles during the subsequent six years (from 
approximately 9% to 19%),4 highlighting this period 
as critical for preventive action.
Systematic reviews of childhood obesity prevention 
studies suggest that school based interventions may 
be effective in reducing the proportion of children 
with excess weight.5 6 Heterogeneity of study design 
and interventions precludes conclusions about which 
combination of components are likely to be most effective. 
Nevertheless, overall, longer duration, multicomponent 
interventions, 
targeting 
school 
curriculums 
and 
food and physical activity environments, providing 
teacher support, and extending activities to the home 
and community were more likely to be associated 
with positive results. However, trials to date have 
had several methodological weaknesses that limit 
recommendations for widespread implementation.5 
In particular, few previous trials reported longer term 
outcomes, subgroup effects, or cost effectiveness.
We report the results of the West Midlands ActiVe 
lifestyle and healthy Eating in School children 
(WAVES) study; a cluster randomised controlled trial 
evaluating an intervention that aims to prevent excess 
weight in primary school children. The trial dealt with 
the main limitations identified in previous research: 
use of the Medical Research Council framework for 
complex intervention development and evaluation7; a 
sample size large enough to detect clinically significant 
differences in adiposity; a comprehensive process 
evaluation; assessment of longer term effects, using a 
range of adiposity and psychosocial measures; and an 
objective measure of physical activity.
Methods
Trial design and eligibility
This was a school based, cluster randomised, 
controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of a 
complex obesity prevention intervention on primary 
school children’s body mass index (BMI) z scores at 15 
and 30 months after baseline measurements (3 and 18 
months post-intervention completion).8
Primary schools in the West Midlands, UK, within 35 
miles of the study centre were eligible for inclusion 
(n=980). The region includes a multiethnic population 
from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds living in rural 
and urban areas. We excluded schools with fewer than 
17 year 1 (aged 5 and 6 years) pupils (minimum cluster 
size) or schools in “special measures” (unlikely to have 
capacity to contribute to study). Within participating 
schools, all children in year 1 at recruitment were 
eligible for inclusion.
Interventions and intervention development
Irrespective of whether children participated in 
measurements, intervention delivery was at school 
class level to all eligible children and their families.
The development process of the WAVES study 
intervention commenced in 2005. We summarised 
intervention components incorporated in previous 
childhood obesity prevention trials (70 included 
studies within eight systematic reviews) in relation to 
setting, target behaviour, and type of activity. To help 
prioritise intervention components we then conducted 
focus groups with parents, school staff, and local 
health, government, and community members. The 
discussions considered the perceived importance and 
feasibility of implementation of techniques (eg, reward 
behaviours, role model, exposure to opportunities for 
physical activity), activities (eg, education materials, 
cooking workshops), and particular settings (eg, 
school curriculum, community setting). We checked 
prioritised ideas against available local resources, and 
the intervention package was formed with input from 
an expert group of professionals. Thus we balanced 
the prioritised intervention components (eg, role 
models to influence behaviour, or family campaigns) 
with the resources that were readily available in our 
setting (eg, the Villa Vitality programme described 
later). This intervention comprised activities within 
two broad aims: increasing children’s physical activity 
levels through school and home and supporting the 
development of health behaviour skills in families 
through activity based learning.9 The intervention 
was further refined following a feasibility study.10 
That study showed that the proposed measurements 
could be completed successfully (measurements 
obtained for 574 out of 606 children with consent 
(95%) at baseline) and that loss to follow-up two years 
after baseline was at an acceptable level (follow-up 
measurements obtained for 83% and 86% of children 
in control and intervention schools, respectively). 
The feasibility study was not powered to investigate 
intervention outcomes, but the direction of effect was 
in favour of the intervention for most outcomes. In 
particular, children in the intervention arm compared 
with control arm had significantly lower adjusted BMI 
z scores at follow-up (−0.15 kg/m2, 95% confidence 
interval −0.27 to −0.03). Table 1 provides details of the 
finalised intervention.
WAVES study intervention and its delivery
The intervention components, delivered over 12 
months, targeted the home and school environment. 
The target group, based on findings from the feasibility 
study, was year 2 children (aged 6 or 7 years) and their 
families. Several behaviour change strategies were 
employed to encourage increased physical activity 
and improved diet quality. School staff were provided 
with training and resources for intervention delivery. A 
termly family newsletter reinforced messages delivered 
through the various intervention components. The 
intervention programme (summarised in table 1) 
comprised four overlapping components:
(1) Thirty minutes of additional moderate to 
vigorous physical activity on each school day—at least 
15 minutes to be outside of break times, although 
class teachers customised timing of delivery and

exact activities undertaken according to their class 
circumstances, supported by resources supplied as 
part of the study. Class teachers selected two preferred 
resources out of four offered and were taken through 
each selected resource and its detailed delivery 
materials by a researcher
(2) Termly cooking workshops during school time, 
which parents were invited to attend to participate 
in with their child and that were preceded by short 
classroom sessions for the children. School staff
 
responsible for implementation (with the exception of 
two schools where equivalent training was delivered 
in school by the same researcher) attended a one day 
training session. To minimise teacher preparation time 
and ensure delivery of consistent nutritional messages, 
the presentation and interactive activity materials, 
together with take home information sheets and 
suggested lesson and workshop plans were provided, 
but timing of sessions and how parents were involved 
was left to the discretion of teachers
(3) A six week programme (Villa Vitality) developed 
to encourage healthy eating and increase physical 
activity and delivered by staff from an iconic sporting 
institution. School classes spent two days undertaking 
activities (indoor based movement routines, using 
dance mats, ball skills session, interactive nutritional 
sessions, and an opportunity to practise cooking skills) 
at an English premier league football club, separated 
by a six week period during which teachers were 
asked to spend curriculum time working on a class 
project and involving children and their parents with 
weekly health challenges. The teacher customised the 
elements undertaken in school supported by a school 
visit from a member of staff from Villa Vitality
(4) Information sheets signposting children and their 
families on ways to be active over the summer (identical 
for all schools) and physical activity opportunities in 
their local area (school specific sheets produced by 
the study team and checked before distribution by the 
school).
Comparator intervention
Schools allocated to the comparator arm continued 
with ongoing year 2 health related activities. In 
addition, we provided citizenship education resources, 
excluding topics related to healthy eating and physical 
activity.
Outcomes
The primary outcome for clinical effectiveness specified 
in our analysis plan and trial protocol was the difference 
in BMI z scores between arms at 15 and 30 months. 
Table 2 summarises the trial protocol prespecified 
secondary outcome measures. At trial registration, the 
secondary outcomes of waist circumference, sum of 
four skinfolds, and body fat percentage were included

Measurements were carried out by trained research staff using standard protocols.
*Primary outcomes (from trial protocol)=difference in BMI z scores between arms at first follow-up and second follow-up, all other outcomes are trial protocol secondary outcomes but some of the 
measures of obesity (proportion of children overweight/obese between arms, waist circumference z score, sum of four skinfolds, and body fat %) were included as primary outcomes in the trial 
registration.
†Where two values were within ≤0.4 cm, a definitive measurement value was calculated as the average of the two. For individuals with three values recorded, a definitive measurement value was 
calculated as the average of the closest pair (within ≤0.4 cm) or average of all three readings (if there were no two closest readings, but the differences between values were ≤0.4 cm). When none 
of the three values were within 0.4 cm of each other no definitive measurement value was calculated.
‡Where two values were within ≤0.4 mm, a definitive measurement value was calculated as the average of the two. For individuals with three values recorded, a definitive measurement value was 
calculated as the average of the closest pair (within ≤0.4 mm) or average of all three readings (if there were no two closest readings, but the differences between values were ≤0.4 mm). When 
none of the three values were within 0.4 cm of each other no definitive measurement value was calculated.
§Skinfold thickness was measured at five different sites (biceps, triceps, thigh, suprailiac, and subscapular), as detailed in the protocol. Compared with the other sites, however, the children found 
the measurement of thigh skinfold thickness more intrusive, resulting in a lower level of data availability for this compared with the other sites. The skinfold thickness summary measure was 
therefore calculated excluding the thigh measurement.
¶Children with less than 24 hours of valid data were excluded. In addition, to ensure representation across the whole 24 hour period, for those with 24 hours of valid data, only those with a 
distribution of at least six hours in each quadrant of the day (morning; 3 am-9 am, noon; 9 am-3 pm, afternoon; 3 pm-9 pm, and midnight; 9 pm-3 am) were included.
**Readings with a systolic or diastolic, or both, value 20 mm hg above the 99.6th centile of the UK age specific and sex specific reference data34 were excluded as implausible values. Pairs of 
readings for which an error message was returned for either the systolic or diastolic value were excluded. Subsequent to these exclusions, systolic and diastolic values that remained were treated 
independently. For individuals with only one systolic or diastolic value this was taken as the definitive measurement value. For individuals with two remaining systolic or diastolic values the 
definitive measurement value was taken as the average of the two values. For individuals with three remaining systolic or diastolic values, provided there was a closest pair of values, the definitive 
measurement value was taken as the average of these two values, or, in instances of no closest pair, the average of all three values.

as primary outcomes. All outcomes were assessed 
at 15 and 30 months post-baseline measures (3 and 
18 months post-intervention). Further details on the 
methods, including standardised operating procedures 
for all primary and secondary outcome measurements, 
are available in the final report of the WAVES study, 
available through the National Institute for Health 
Research website (www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk).
Implementation
The trial statistician (KH) undertook sampling and 
subsequent randomisation, and the trial coordinator 
(ERL) recruited schools. To enable subgroup analysis 
we stratified schools by ethnic mix of pupils, and we 
used a weighted random sampling strategy to increase 
the selection likelihood (3:1) of schools with a higher 
minority ethnic population. Using this method, we 
selected 200 schools, which were ordered using a 
random number generator and sequentially invited to 
participate. To allow measurement of a large number 
of children in a limited timeframe within study 
resources, we recruited and randomised the schools 
into two groups (27 schools in each group), one year 
apart. Parental informed consent was sought and 
verbal assent from the children was obtained for all 
measurements undertaken.
Participant assessment and data collection 
procedures
Baseline assessment took place when children were 
at the end of year 1 (aged 5 or 6 years). Outcome 
assessments 
using 
identical 
procedures 
were 
undertaken at 15 months (first follow-up) and 30 
months (second follow-up) post-baseline (aged 7 or 
8, and 8 or 9 years, respectively). In schools recruited 
in the first year (group 1), we further assessed at 
39 months (third follow-up) post-baseline (aged 9 
or 10 years), but this was not possible for schools 
recruited in the second year (group 2) within the trial 
timetable. We collected data from school records, 
direct assessment of participating children in school, 
and parent questionnaires distributed at the time of 
pupil measurements. Trained research staff undertook 
assessments 
using 
standardised 
protocols 
and 
validated instruments, as detailed in the protocol8 and 
summarised in table 2.
Sample size
Sample size was based on the primary outcome (BMI 
z score), taking into account repeated measures 
(estimated 
correlation 
between 
measures=0.9), 
varying cluster size (assuming mean 25 (SD 23) 
cluster size), and likely estimates of the intraclass 
correlation coefficient (0 to 0.04). To detect a clinically 
meaningful difference of 0.25 BMI z score11 between 
intervention and comparator groups with 90% power, 
a two sided α of 0.05, and estimated pupil dropout 
rate of 20%, we needed a follow-up sample of 1000 
children from 50 schools. Allowing for school drop-
out of 8%, we recruited 54 schools. This sample 
size also provides more than 80% power to detect a 
0.125 difference in BMI z score (clinically important 
difference for prevention12) and an approximately 7% 
difference in the change of proportion of children who 
are overweight or obese from baseline to follow-up in 
control compared with intervention schools.
Randomisation
A blocked balancing algorithm was used to randomise 
participating schools to intervention or comparator 
arms. Schools were randomly allocated according to a 
randomisation scheme, which minimised imbalance13 
on several characteristics: percentage of pupils 
eligible for free school meals (measure of deprivation), 
proportion of pupils from South Asian, black African-
Caribbean, white, or other ethnic groups, and school 
size. We randomised the first 27 schools (group 1) 
within the first block. A year later we randomly 
allocated the remaining 27 schools (group 2) in a 
similar way, but conditioning on the allocations that 
had already been made in group 1.
To ensure concealment of allocation we carried out 
randomisation after baseline measurements. Sessional 
researchers blind to arm allocation mainly undertook 
further data collection. Supplementary figure 1 
summarises the timeline for trial processes.
Statistical analysis
Analyses of all outcomes were by intention to treat and 
are reported at 15, 30, and 39 months after baseline (3, 
18, and 27 months after the end of the intervention). 
For the primary analyses (complete case analysis), we 
used mixed linear regression models for all continuous 
outcomes (eg, BMI z score) and Poisson mixed 
regression for binary outcomes to allow estimation 
of adjusted risk differences consistent with CONSORT 
guidelines. To accommodate any non-normality of 
the outcomes, we transformed data when necessary 
and when such transformation improved the model. 
The baseline adjusted model included the baseline 
measurement and treatment arm as the independent 
variables, and to account for the clustered nature of 
the sample, school as the random effect. We also report 
models further adjusted for prespecified baseline 
school and child level covariates. Planned subgroup 
analyses, using interaction tests, examined whether 
any intervention effects differed by ethnicity, sex, 
socioeconomic status, baseline weight status, and 
fidelity of implementation.

at 0.01 for all other outcomes. Analyses were carried 
out in Stata 1314 and REALCOM-impute15 software.
Because of the timelines of recruitment and outcome 
assessments, there was no opportunity for interim 
analyses. The trial steering committee maintained 
assessment of data quality and completion.
Process evaluation
We used a variety of methods for assessment 
of intervention delivery and process, including 
interviews with teachers; parent and child focus 
groups; head teacher, class teacher, and parental 
questionnaires; 
teacher 
logbooks; 
and 
direct 
observation of sessions by researchers.16 With the 
exception of the signposting sheets for which there 
was no variation in implementation between schools, 
we used a consensus method for each of the other 
three intervention components to allocate schools 
a score on a 5 point Likert scale for each dimension 
of the process evaluation (fidelity and adherence; 
reach, dose, and exposure; recruitment, quality, and 
participant responsiveness). Context and information 
on programme differentiation influence all of these 
and were therefore also considered throughout this 
score allocation process. We then ranked schools by 
total score, and grouped the schools to reflect low, 
medium, or high intervention implementation. A 
detailed report on the method used to synthesise the 
process evaluation data is published elsewhere.17
Changes to methods from trial  
registration stage
The trial registration was submitted before the practical 
planning for the trial had started. Some aspects were 
subsequently altered in the development of the trial 
protocol, but the trial registration was not updated 
and therefore does not incorporate these changes. 
Supplementary table 1 summarises all changes between 
trial registration and trial protocol. In particular, at 
the early planning stages for the trial (and before the 
start of baseline measurements) the investigator team 
modified the primary outcomes from those specified at 
trial registration. To increase power to detect change 
and for consistency and comparability with previous 
trials, we changed the primary outcome for clinical 
effectiveness from the binary variable specified in 
the registry (of difference in proportion of children

was informed by detailed consultation with parents, 
teachers, and other school staff. The intervention 
was further refined and the process for measuring 
outcomes tested and adapted by asking the children, 
parents, and teachers about their experiences during 
the feasibility study. Measures of wellbeing and body 
dissatisfaction were included as outcomes based on 
their perceived importance among school staff. Our 
research team includes an education advisor at the 
Health Education Service, who has regular contact 
with schools and advised on school and participant 
recruitment. No patients were involved in this trial.
Results
Figure 1 shows the flow of schools and pupils during the 
trial. Among 2462 eligible pupils from 54 participating 
schools at baseline, parental consent for baseline 
measurements was obtained from 1467 (59.6%). 
Recruitment took place between April and May 2011 
(group 1 schools and pupils) and from January to 
May 2012 (group 2 schools and pupils). Table 3 
summarises the baseline characteristics. Although 
school characteristics were balanced between the two 
groups, there was baseline imbalance at the pupil 
level, with children in the control arm compared 
with intervention arm more likely to be male (52.7% 
v 49.2%), from generally less deprived households 
(mean index of multiple deprivation score 37.6 v 39.8), 
 
less likely to be overweight (mean BMI z score 0.15 v 
0.23), more likely to consume five portions of fruit and 
vegetables daily (64.8% v 59.8%), and more likely to 
achieve at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous 
physical activity daily (49.6% v 46.4%).
Primary outcomes
The primary outcomes are also reported in the trial 
protocol (table 4). At 15 months the mean BMI z score 
was non-significantly lower in the intervention arm 
compared with control arm: mean difference −0.075 
(95% confidence interval −0.183 to 0.033, P=0.18) in 
baseline adjusted models (n=1197, 86% of those with 
baseline BMI z score available) and −0.077 (−0.191 
to 0.037, P=0.19) in further adjusted (n=837, 60% 
of those with baseline BMI z score available) models. 
At 30 months the mean difference was smaller and 
remained non-significant (−0.027, −0.137 to 0.083; 
P=0.63) in the baseline adjusted model (n=1094, 79% 
of those with baseline BMI z score available).
Secondary outcomes
The secondary outcomes are as reported in the trial 
protocol and trial registration information, unless 
stated otherwise, (table 5).
Anthropometric measurements—these are included 
as primary outcomes in trial registration information 
(see “Changes to methods from trial registration 
stage”). In the intervention arm compared with control 
arm, the baseline adjusted risk difference in the 
proportion of children who were overweight or obese 
was −0.013 (99% confidence interval −0.075 to 0.071, 
P=0.66) and 0.002 (−0.068 to 0.093, P=0.95) at 15 
and 30 months, respectively. The mean difference in 
sum of skinfolds, waist circumference z score, and 
body fat percentage were all non-significant, but 
slightly favoured the control group.
Diet, physical activity, and blood pressure—the 
mean differences in total daily energy intake, physical 
activity energy expenditure, and systolic and diastolic 
blood pressures between groups were inconsistent 
in direction and statistically non-significant at both 
follow-ups.
Longer term clinical effectiveness—among group 
1 school participants who were followed up at 39 
months (488 pupils (246 controls), 27 schools (14 
controls)), the mean BMI z score was lower in the 
intervention arm compared with control arm in the 
baseline adjusted model (mean difference −0.20, 99% 
confidence interval −0.46 to 0.05, P=0.04) and further 
adjusted models (−0.18; −0.39 to 0.03, P=0.03). 
We were not aware of any contextual or intervention 
delivery aspects that differed between the groups. 
To investigate why the intervention appeared more 
effective at this later time point, we undertook post hoc 
analysis to consider whether schools recruited in group 
1 differed from those in group 2, both in characteristics 
(see appendix, table A1) and in outcomes at earlier 
time points (see appendix, table A2). This showed a 
noticeable imbalance in baseline adiposity between

which was maintained through to the third follow-up 
(although no longer statistically significant at the 1% 
level). In contrast there was no significant difference 
between arms at any time point in group 2 schools (see 
appendix, table A2).
Harms—quality of life, as total score or subdomains, 
social acceptance, or dissatisfaction with body image 
did not differ significantly between arms at any 
time. Thus we found no evidence of harm from the 
intervention.
Subgroup and sensitivity analyses—all subgroup 
analyses (by ethnicity, sex, socioeconomic or weight 
status, and fidelity of implementation) and sensitivity 
analyses were consistent with the main analyses and 
did not change any conclusions (results not shown).
Process evaluation—detailed results from the 
process evaluation are reported separately.17-19 
Briefly, 
the 
intervention 
was 
generally 
well 
implemented, although no school delivered all 
components completely as intended. The scores 
developed to represent overall fidelity of programme 
implementation show that just under half the schools 
(12/26) achieved at least 75% of the maximum 
possible score and only five schools failed to achieve 
at least 65% of that maximum. Teachers found the 
daily physical activity intervention component the 
most challenging to deliver, with only four of 26 
schools (17%) achieving high implementation fidelity 
for that component and 58% of schools (15/26) 
allocated to the low implementation fidelity group. 
In contrast, 42% (11/26) and 65% (17/26) of schools 
achieved high implementation fidelity for the cooking 
workshop and Villa Vitality components, respectively, 
with classification to the low implementation fidelity 
group for 42% (11/26) (cooking workshop) and 
27% (7/26) (Villa Vitality). However, despite some 
challenges to implementation, the interviews and 
focus groups indicated that the programme was often 
well received both by teachers19 and by parents and 
children (see box).20
discussion
We found no overall evidence of improvement in the 
primary outcomes of reduction in body mass index 
(BMI) z scores at 15 and 30 months after a childhood 
obesity prevention programme delivered through 
schools and targeting 6 and 7 year olds. However, 
confidence intervals did not exclude between arm 
differences in BMI z score of 0.125, thought to be 
clinically important for prevention. The intervention 
did not have any effects on secondary anthropometric, 
behavioural, or clinical outcomes, and there were 
no differential effects in prespecified subgroups. A 
clinically significant difference in BMI z score in favour 
of the intervention was seen in the first cohort of 
schools recruited that had data available at 39 months. 
Subsequent post hoc analysis suggests this may have 
been a cohort effect, with evidence of effectiveness in 
group 1 schools at all time points but no effect seen in 
group 2 schools at any time point. The outcomes used 
to assess harm did not differ between the groups.
Strengths and weaknesses of this study
The WAVES study is a large childhood obesity 
prevention trial within a socioeconomically and 
ethnically 
diverse 
population, 
with 
sufficient 
sample size to assess the primary outcome. Phased 
development of the 12 month multicomponent 
intervention was guided by the Medical Research 
Council framework for complex interventions,9 21 
including 
a 
successful 
feasibility 
trial.10 
The 
intervention 
comprised 
elements 
identified 
as 
promising in systematic reviews5 6 and incorporated 
a range of behaviour change techniques, including 
those associated with positive outcomes in previous 
childhood obesity prevention trials.22 Outcomes were 
assessed with mainly objective measurements, using 
validated instruments and standardised protocols. 
Loss to follow-up was relatively small, with 80% of 
pupils retained to the second follow-up, and loss 
of one school. A prespecified analysis plan took 
account of clustering, and the findings were robust 
to a range of sensitivity analyses. This was also one 
of few trials that undertook longer term follow-up 
(39 months) to assess sustainability of intervention 
effects. Comprehensive process evaluation (described 
in more detail elsewhere16) helped to contextualise 
the findings and to interpret the results.17
Nevertheless, there were also several limitations. 
Parental consent for study measurements being 
obtained for only 60% of eligible children could 
introduce selection bias; however, a pupil level 
comparison of demographic characteristics (sex, 
ethnicity, deprivation) between those with and those 
without consent did not show any major differences. 
The balancing algorithm to allocate schools was 
based on whole school (cluster) level data. However, 
within clusters, only children from one year group 
were included, and just over half of those consented 
to study measurements. There was notable baseline 
imbalance between arms in the group 2 cohort 
(with the intervention arm having greater adiposity 
than the control arm), which, despite the use of 
adjustment methods, may have attenuated the main 
results. Statistical adjustment assumes a common 
linear relation between covariates and outcome in all 
clusters, and misspecification of the model may lead to 
both under-adjustment and over-adjustment. Baseline 
imbalance is a known limitation of cluster trials and can 
best be overcome with recruitment of larger numbers

of clusters. Although follow-up to 30 months was in 
all groups, longer term follow-up (to 39 months) was 
limited to a subset of participating schools. The Child 
And Diet Evaluation Tool (CADET) provided a quick, 
practical dietary assessment tool with relatively low 
respondent burden,24 25 resulting in useable data from 
approximately 85% of children at baseline (81% first 
follow-up, 82% second follow-up). However, estimates 
of dietary intake may not reflect habitual intake, there 
was a risk of misreporting,26 and there may have been 
seasonal variation27 between data collection periods. 
Usable data on physical activity were available for 
76% of children at baseline (60% first follow-up, 
52% second follow-up). These are similar to the rates 
achieved in other such studies.28
Comparison with other studies
Our results build on the findings of previous reviews 
and address limitations in previous childhood obesity 
prevention trials. Two systematic reviews suggested 
that there was moderate6 to strong5 evidence of 
effectiveness of school based interventions in 
preventing childhood obesity, although heterogeneity 
of interventions, variable design quality, and lack of 
longer term follow-up limit interpretation. A meta-
analysis showed that the summary magnitude of effect 
on BMI z score compared with the control was −0.15 
units,5 which is smaller than the effect size used for 
estimating sample size in our trial. Nevertheless, the 
WAVES study was larger than the 21 previous obesity 
prevention trials with low risk of bias included in the 
meta-analysis (n=9 to 574). Since the publication 
of the reviews, findings from another UK cluster 
randomised controlled trial, the Active for Life Year 5 
(AFLY5) including more than 2000 children from 60 
schools are available.28 The trial primarily attempted 
to influence activity levels and fruit and vegetable 
consumption, although it also reported on adiposity 
outcomes. The intervention was curriculum based, 
focusing on educational approaches rather than the 
more experiential skills based intervention in the 
WAVES study. In contrast with our trial, the target 
population was children at the end of the primary 
school years, when rates of obesity have already 
increased substantially, and included few children 
from minority ethnic groups and more deprived areas. 
Nevertheless, similar to our findings, there was no 
evidence of an intervention effect on behavioural or 
weight outcomes at 12 months.
Interpretation of the findings
The balance of components, intensity, and behaviour 
change strategies used to deliver the intervention may 
have contributed to the absence of evidence of effect 
on the primary outcomes in WAVES and other trials. 
Although fidelity of implementation for the WAVES 
study intervention programme was reasonably high 
overall, no school delivered all components completely 
per protocol, and a few schools failed to deliver some 
or all of the components. This may have attenuated 
any effect.29 In addition, owing to competing demands 
on teachers, components that required greater teacher 
input tended to be less well implemented and this 
was the main explanation for differences in fidelity 
between components. This suggests that delivery of 
a more intensive teacher led intervention in a school 
setting would not be feasible without additional 
resources. Educational and experiential interventions 
of longer duration that are embedded within a whole 
school setting are likely to be prohibitively costly 
and complex to evaluate using clinical trial methods. 
The intervention was developed on the basis of 
promising strategies in trials published before the 
feasibility study (about 10 years before the definitive 
trial). As a result, strategies such as those based on 
behavioural economics aimed at altering the social 
and physical environment were not included as part 
of the intervention. Although the findings from the 
feasibility study suggested the WAVES intervention 
was promising, intervention delivery for the trial and 
subsequent follow-up measurements took place some 
years later, during which time wider environmental 
changes might have diluted any effects. Researcher 
contact with schools during the feasibility study 
was also much greater, but this was not replicable 
in the definitive trial with a larger number of schools 
and would not be implementable outside of a trial 
setting. Methodological limitations with baseline 
imbalance may have also contributed to the observed 
findings with heterogeneity of effect between schools. 
However, even the cohort effect observed in group 1 
schools was small, suggesting that childhood obesity 
prevention is unlikely to be achieved by schools alone. 
While school is an important setting for influencing 
children’s health behaviour, and delivery of knowledge 
and skills to support healthy lifestyles is one of its 
mandatory functions, wider influences from the family, 
community, media, and the food industry must also be 
considered. The qualitative data from teachers19 and 
parents,20 collected as part of our process evaluation, 
support the possibility that these wider influences have 
a greater effect than any school based intervention. 
A metasynthesis of qualitative studies exploring 
the role of primary schools in preventing childhood 
obesity highlighted the need for schools, parents, 
and government to work together to promote healthy 
lifestyles in children and to support activities in the 
school setting.30

Conclusions
The multicomponent WAVES study intervention, 
which was feasible to deliver and for which there was 
no evidence of harm, did not result in a statistically 
significant difference in BMI z score overall, and 
there was no evidence of effect on measured diet 
or physical activity levels in children. Although 
wider implementation of this intervention cannot 
be recommended for obesity prevention, the lower 
cost components could be considered by schools to 
fulfil their mandated responsibilities for education 
on health and wellbeing. Within the context of the 
wider evidence, it is likely that any effect of school 
based educational, motivational, and skill centred 
interventions on obesity prevention is small. Several 
community based interventions targeting wider 
environments have also been evaluated recently, using 
non-randomised experimental designs. Although a 
few of these have shown evidence of small effects 
and lower weight gain in children from intervention 
communities,31 32 the findings are not consistent33 
and need further evaluation. Interventions based on 
behavioural economics such as nudge theory34 also 
merit further investigation. Even marginal effects 
may be important within a wider systems approach 
to obesity prevention, which incorporates multiple 
agencies and widespread policy change to support 
healthy behaviours.
