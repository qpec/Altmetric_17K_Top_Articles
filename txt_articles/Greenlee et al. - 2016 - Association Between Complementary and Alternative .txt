 DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—In this multisite prospective cohort study (the 
Breast Cancer Quality of Care [BQUAL] study) designed to examine predictors of breast cancer 
treatment initiation and adherence, 685 women younger than 70 years with nonmetastatic invasive 
breast cancer were recruited from Columbia University Medical Center, Kaiser Permanente 
Northern California, and Henry Ford Health System and enrolled between May 2006 and July 31, 
2010. Overall, 306 patients (45%) were clinically indicated to receive chemotherapy per National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Participants were followed for up to 12 months.
EXPOSURES—Baseline interviews assessed current use of 5 CAM modalities (vitamins and/or 
minerals, herbs and/or botanicals, other natural products, mind-body self-practice, mind-body 
practitioner-based practice). CAM use definitions included any use, dietary supplement use, mind-
body use, and a CAM index summing the 5 modalities.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Chemotherapy initiation was assessed via self-report 
up to 12 months after baseline. Multivariable logistic regression models examined a priori 
hypotheses testing whether CAM use was associated with chemotherapy initiation, adjusting for 
demographic and clinical covariates, and delineating groups by age and chemotherapy indication.
RESULTS—A cohort of 685 women younger than 70 years (mean age, 59 years; median age, 59 
years) with nonmetastatic invasive breast cancer were recruited and followed for up to 12 months 
to examine predictors of breast cancer treatment initiation. Baseline CAM use was reported by 598 
women (87%). Chemotherapy was initiated by 272 women (89%) for whom chemotherapy was 
indicated, compared with 135 women (36%) for whom chemotherapy was discretionary. Among 
women for whom chemotherapy was indicated, dietary supplement users and women with high 
CAM index scores were less likely than nonusers to initiate chemotherapy (odds ratio [OR], 0.16; 
95% CI, 0.03–0.51; and OR per unit, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46–0.87, respectively). Use of mind-body 
practices was not related to chemotherapy initiation (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 0.57–3.59). There was no 
association between CAM use and chemotherapy initiation among women for whom 
chemotherapy was discretionary.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—CAM use was high among patients with early-stage 
breast cancer enrolled in a multisite prospective cohort study. Current dietary supplement use and 
higher number of CAM modalities used but not mind-body practices were associated with 
decreased initiation of clinically indicated chemotherapy. Oncologists should consider discussing 
CAM with their patients during the chemotherapy decision-making process.
Despite the survival benefits associated with adjuvant treatment for breast cancer, not all 
women initiate treatment.1 Psychosocial factors, belief systems, and clinical, demographic, 
and health care provider characteristics are associated with chemotherapy initiation among 
patients with breast cancer.2–5 High cancer-related anxiety, optimism, negative experiences 
with physicians, belief in the value of alternative medicine, concerns about risks associated 
with chemotherapy, and lack of knowledge of breast cancer treatment protocols have been 
reported as characteristics of patients with breast cancer who do not receive indicated 
chemotherapy.6–8 The same set of patient characteristics also tends to be associated with 
high complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use. CAM use among patients with 
breast cancer has been increasing over the past 2 decades9–11 but few studies have evaluated 
how CAM use affects decisions regarding chemotherapy.8,12

 Studies often define CAM using a broad, nonspecific definition that includes any therapies 
or approaches that are a complement or alternative to conventional medical therapies.13,14 
However, when defining clinical populations using CAM, it may be more useful to consider 
CAM using specific subcategories, such as dietary supplements and mind-body practices. 
Dietary supplements include vitamins, minerals, botanicals, and other natural products. 
Mind-body practices include practices such as yoga, meditation, qi gong, acupuncture, and 
massage. In the oncology setting, patients may use both dietary supplements and mind-body 
practices to relieve symptoms, for general health and wellness promotion and to increase 
their sense of hope and control, though the evidence base for mind-body practices is stronger 
than for dietary supplement use.15–17 Patient motivations and the benefits they hope to 
obtain may also differ between these 2 categories of CAM. It has been hypothesized that 
CAM use may be a risk factor for not initiating standard oncology treatments because 
patients may be exploring other alternative treatment approaches or because conventional 
oncology treatments are not congruent with patient belief systems.8,12 However, prior 
studies on CAM use among patients with breast cancer have not differentiated whether 
standard oncology treatments were indicated based on clinical characteristics of patients.
The Breast Cancer Quality of Care Study (BQUAL) is a prospective cohort study examining 
demographic, behavioral, biomedical, and psychosocial predictors of initiation and 
adherence to adjuvant therapy among early stage breast cancer patients. Prior to initiation of 
study enrollment, we inserted a baseline questionnaire assessing current CAM use to test the 
a priori hypothesis that CAM use is associated with chemotherapy initiation after controlling 
for demographic and clinical covariates, and herein we present those results.
Methods
Study Design and Population
The BQUAL study was a large, multicenter prospective cohort study of women with 
nonmetastatic invasive breast cancer.18 Participants were recruited from May 2006 to July 
31, 2010, from 3 sites: Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC), Kaiser Permanente 
Northern California (KPNC), and Henry Ford Health System (HFHS). Women were eligible 
if they were 20 years or older, recently diagnosed with invasive stage I to III breast cancer, 
and either 3 or more months from diagnosis or had not begun their third cycle of 
chemotherapy. The goal was to enroll women prior to hormone therapy initiation. Women 
were excluded if they did not speak English, were previously diagnosed with cancer 
excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer, did not have a telephone, and/or had documented or 
self-reported serious memory deficits. All participants provided written informed consent. 
All study procedures were approved by the institutional review boards at CUMC, KPNC, 
and HFHS, and the US Army Medical Research and Material Command Office of Research 
Protections and Human Research Protection Office.
A total of 1158 women (mean age, 59 years; median age, 59 years) enrolled in the BQUAL 
study and completed a baseline interview. For this analysis, we excluded women for whom 
chemotherapy was contraindicated based upon National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
(NCCN) criteria19 (n = 89), who had missing medical records (n = 2) or chemotherapy 
eligibility data (n = 41), had stage IV recurrent or metastatic disease (n = 10), did not

 provide data on CAM use at baseline (n = 123), or had unknown or missing demographic 
and clinical characteristics (n = 109). Women 70 years and older (n = 191) were excluded as 
this group was not indicated to receive chemotherapy according to NCCN criteria and other 
competing factors may influence chemotherapy decision making in this groups that cannot 
be accounted for in analysis. The final sample size was 685.
Data Collection
Subject sociodemographic, comorbidities, and CAM use data were collected via self-report 
in baseline interviews. Breast cancer treatment data were collected via self-report during 
telephone interviews at baseline, 4 to 8 weeks and up to 12 months after baseline, and via 
medical record reviews. Medical record reviews were used to define tumor characteristics.
CAM Use
At baseline, participants were asked whether they were currently using 7 different types of 
CAM modalities. Dichotomous (yes/no) variables were created to indicate current use of 
dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, herbal and/or botanical supplements, and 
other over-the-counter natural products) and mind-body practices (including self-practices 
such as yoga and practitioner-based approaches such as acupuncture). We computed a CAM 
use index summarizing the number of CAM types used (range 0 to 5) including vitamin 
and/or mineral supplements, herbal and/or botanical supplements, other over-the-counter 
natural products (eg, fish oil, glucosamine, melatonin), mind-body self-practices (eg, yoga 
and meditation) and practitioner-based mind-body practices (eg, acupuncture, massage, 
reiki). For this analysis, special diets and multivitamins were excluded from the definition of 
CAM, as these are very commonly used and often are not categorized as CAM.20
Chemotherapy Initiation and Indication
Chemotherapy initiation (yes/no) up to 12 months after baseline was ascertained via self-
report and medical record review. Prior publications on chemotherapy initiation have 
reported 98% to 100% concordance between self-report and medical record abstraction.21–24 
The 2006 NCCN breast cancer treatment guidelines19 (eTable 1 in the Supplement) were 
used to determine whether chemotherapy was clinically indicated or discretionary based on 
age, ER and PR status, ERBB2 (formerly HER2 or HER2/neu) status, tumor size, and nodal 
involvement.
Covariates and Potential Confounders
Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were examined as covariates and potential 
confounders. Sociodemographic characteristics included age, race, education, household 
income, employment status, and marital status. Breast cancer and other clinical 
characteristics include year of diagnosis, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 
stage, grade, nodal status, tumor size, ER and PR status, ERBB2 status, and Charlson 
comorbidity score.25

 Statistical Methods
Separate unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression models evaluated associations 
between current use of any CAM (yes/no), current dietary supplement use (yes/no), current 
mind-body use (yes/no), and number of CAM modalities currently used (range 0–5) and 
subsequent chemotherapy initiation. All statistical tests were 2-sided with a significance 
level of .05. Demographic and clinical factors were tested as potential confounders using the 
change-in-estimate approach,26 in which confounders were identified as factors that modify 
the β coefficient of the exposure-outcome association by 10%. Race/ethnicity and Charlson 
comorbidity index were identified a priori as potential confounders. The final covariates 
included in models were age, race/ethnicity, education, grade, tumor size, ER and PR status, 
ERBB2 status, and Charlson comorbidity index.
Because one-third of participants joined the study after initiating chemotherapy, we 
conducted sensitivity analyses to examine whether observed associations differed when 
analyses were restricted to women who did not initiate chemotherapy prior to the baseline 
interview. To evaluate the association between vitamin and/or mineral use and chemotherapy 
initiation, sensitivity analyses were conducted by restricting the definition of dietary 
supplement use to vitamin and/or mineral use. To account for potential bias introduced by 
the clustering of data by recruitment site, we performed additional sensitivity analyses using 
generalized estimating equation models clustering by site27 with the exchangeable working 
correlation matrix and logit link function.
All analyses were conducted using R statistical software, version 3.2.2 (R Foundation).28
Results
Cohort Characteristics
Summaries of participant characteristics by chemotherapy indication group and 
chemotherapy initiation can be found in eTable 2 of the Supplement. Overall, 306 women 
(45%) were clinically indicated to receive chemotherapy based on NCCN guidelines; the 
remaining women were considered to have a discretionary recommendation for 
chemotherapy. By 12 months following baseline, 272 women (89%) for whom 
chemotherapy was clinically indicated initiated treatment, while the chemotherapy 
discretionary group had a much lower initiation rate (n = 135 [36%]).
CAM Use
At baseline, the prevalence of current CAM use was high (Table 1). Among all participants, 
598 women (87%) reported using any CAM at baseline, and use of dietary supplements and 
mind-body practices were common (n = 482 [70%] and n = 483 [71%], respectively). The 
median number of CAM modalities used was 2 with 261 women (38%) reporting currently 
using 3 or more modalities. Compared with nonusers, dietary supplement and mind-body 
users tended to have higher education and been recruited from KPNC (eTable 3 in the 
Supplement); there were few other differences across groups.

 CAM Use and Chemotherapy Initiation
Women for Whom Chemotherapy Was Indicated—In unadjusted analyses, among 
women for whom chemotherapy was indicated, women who did not initiate chemotherapy 
were more likely to report current dietary supplement use compared with women who did 
initiate chemotherapy (30 of 34 [88%] vs 169 of 272 [62%]; P = .002) (Table 1). Of the 
specific categories of dietary supplements, vitamin and/or mineral use was the strongest 
correlate of not initiating chemotherapy, with 24 of 34 (71%) of the noninitiators using 
vitamins and/or minerals, compared with 75 of 272 (28%) of the initiators (P < .001). In 
addition, women who used more CAM modalities, as indicated by a higher CAM index 
score, were significantly less likely to initiate chemotherapy (P = .001). There was no 
association between mind-body practices and chemotherapy initiation in unadjusted analyses 
(Table 1).
In multivariable models, among women for whom chemotherapy was indicated, current 
dietary supplement use (adjusted OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.03–0.51) and a higher score on the 
CAM index (adjusted OR per unit, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46–0.87) were associated with decreased 
likelihood of chemotherapy initiation, after controlling for demographic and clinical 
characteristics (Table 2). However, mind-body practices were not associated with decreased 
chemotherapy (adjusted OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 0.57–3.59).
Women for Whom Chemotherapy Was Discretionary—In unadjusted analyses, 
among women for whom chemotherapy was clinically discretionary, there were no 
associations between CAM use and chemotherapy initiation, except for other natural 
products (Table 1). Similarly, analyses using multivariable models showed no statistically 
significant associations between current CAM use and chemotherapy (Table 2). Of note, 
among women for whom chemotherapy was discretionary, there was a trend toward an 
association between a higher CAM use index and chemotherapy initiation (adjusted OR, 
0.83; 95% CI, 0.67–1.01).
Sensitivity Analyses
At baseline (mean [SD] 89 (33) days postdiagnosis], 265 women (39%) had initiated 
chemotherapy. To control for temporality, sensitivity analyses restricted participants to 
women who did not initiate chemotherapy prior to baseline. Results were consistent with our 
primary analyses, suggesting that reverse causation could not explain our results (data not 
shown). Similarly, sensitivity analyses restricting dietary supplement use to vitamin and/or 
mineral use yielded results consistent with the results for all dietary supplements (data not 
shown). Generalized estimating equation analyses accounting for clustering by recruitment 
site also did not affect the results (data not shown). Sensitivity analyses were run using a 
data set that included women with missing and unknown data. The results were consistent 
with the primary analyses (data not shown), suggesting that missingness was not a source of 
bias.

 Discussion
In a multicenter cohort of patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer, CAM use was high. 
Dietary supplement use and higher number of CAM modalities used, but not mind-body 
practices, were associated with failure to initiate chemotherapy among women for whom 
chemotherapy was clinically indicated based upon NCCN guidelines. This result was robust 
after adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates, such as age, race/ethnicity, 
education, tumor characteristics, and co-morbidity. Women for whom chemotherapy is 
discretionary will likely have different reasons for chemotherapy initiation compared with 
women for whom chemotherapy is indicated. Here, we found that CAM use in the 
discretionary group was not associated with chemotherapy initiation. We hypothesized that 
CAM use would be associated with chemotherapy initiation among the discretionary group 
because there is more leeway in the decision making process, but we did not find that this 
was true. Instead, in the group with a clear clinical indication for chemotherapy, users of 
CAM were significantly over represented among the relatively small group that did not 
receive this indicated treatment. We previously showed that in the same cohort, 
chemotherapy noninitiation was associated with older age, more negative beliefs about 
chemotherapy effectiveness, and more concern about adverse effects.2 This analysis 
identifies dietary supplement use as a potential new risk factor for chemotherapy 
noninitiation.
Among patients with cancer, patients with breast cancer are the highest users of 
CAM.9,10,29,30 The prevalence of CAM use observed in the BQUAL study population is 
similar to what has been observed in other populations of patients with breast cancer, 
ranging from 62% in the Nurses’ Health Study,31 to 80% in Women’s Healthy Eating and 
Living,32 to 95% in the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project.30 Estimates of use in 
different cohorts likely vary depending on the definition of CAM use, the population, and 
the year, as patterns of CAM use in adults have varied over time.33
Among CAM modalities, dietary supplement use was associated with a lower likelihood of 
chemotherapy initiation, contrasting with mind-body practices, which were not. By nature, 
dietary supplement use differs from mind-body practices. Dietary supplements are ingested 
substances, whereas mind-body practices include behaviors and body-work. Presumably, 
patients with cancer who use either type of CAM hope to achieve a health-related benefit.15 
In the general population, users of dietary supplements often use these products to improve 
or maintain overall health or for organ-specific health reasons (eg, heart, joint, skin).34 A 
population-based study of patients with cancer35 reported that patients with cancer took 
dietary supplements because “it was something they could do to help themselves”35(p677) to 
boost immune function and to improve energy. In contrast, users of mind-body practices 
often do so for psychological benefits (eg, stress, anxiety, depression) and pain 
management.36 Distinguishing these motivations for use may explain our findings. To date, 
in the breast oncology setting the majority of dietary supplement interventions have not 
proven beneficial, whereas mind-body practices have a stronger evidence base for improving 
treatment-related adverse effects, psychological conditions, and quality of life.16

 Our results contrast with an observational analysis from the multicenter Women’s Healthy 
Eating and Living (WHEL) study,32 that reported that women who reported regular or 
occasional CAM use with consultation of a CAM practitioner were more likely to receive 
chemotherapy compared with individuals who did not use CAM.32 However, the WHEL 
study ascertained CAM use approximately 5 years after breast cancer treatment, potentially 
leading to recall bias. Moreover, the WHEL study excluded dietary supplements from their 
definition of CAM use. As we found that chemotherapy noninitiation was most likely to 
occur among users of dietary supplements as compared with other CAM modalities, the 
exclusion of dietary supplements from the WHEL study CAM definition may have led to 
conclusions different from ours.
It is important to consider possible alternative explanations for our findings. It is unclear 
whether the association between CAM use and chemotherapy noninitiation reflects 
longstanding decision-making patterns among participants. It is possible that CAM users 
who did not initiate treatment were longtime CAM users and chose CAM as an alternative to 
chemotherapy. However, the current study did not collect data on CAM use history and 
therefore cannot rule out this possibility. Nevertheless, regardless of a woman’s prior CAM 
use, our findings suggest that current CAM use, which in a clinical encounter is easier to 
assess than past use, was associated with chemotherapy noninitiation.
The difference in the findings between women with and without clinically indicated 
chemotherapy warrants exploration. We previously reported that treatment, decision making, 
and psychosocial factors related to chemotherapy initiation were largely consistent between 
these 2 groups.2 In contrast, our findings here show that CAM use is a predictor of 
chemotherapy noninitiation among women with clinically indicated treatment but not among 
those with discretionary chemotherapy. In the face of the uncertainty of the benefit of 
chemotherapy, it is possible that biomedical factors, such as recommendation by a physician, 
may trump other health beliefs and practices, such as CAM use.
Our study’s major strength is the prospective examination of CAM use and chemotherapy 
initiation. Though causation cannot be inferred from an observational study, the time lag 
between baseline data collection and follow-up for chemotherapy initiation for the majority 
of participants established a temporal relationship between CAM use and chemotherapy 
initiation. In addition, we used NCCN guidelines to ascertain clinical indication of 
chemotherapy.
However, there are important limitations to acknowledge. Among women for whom 
chemotherapy was clinically indicated, the majority of women (89%) initiated 
chemotherapy, and thus noninitiation (11%) was a rare event in a relatively small population 
of women (n = 34). Despite the small number of events, we were able to detect statistically 
significant differences that were robust after adjusting for clinical and demographic factors. 
Both chemotherapy initiation and CAM data were self-reported, possibly resulting in 
misclassification and reporting bias. In addition, we did not collect data from the physicians 
on the specific chemotherapy recommendation that was given to each patient, nor did we 
collect data from the patients on the reason(s) for declining chemotherapy. Also, we do not 
have data on genomic risk of recurrence, which is now standard of care and may be an

 important driver of chemotherapy initiation but was not commonly considered in clinical 
settings while BQUAL was enrolling participants. The BQUAL CAM data lack detailed 
information on individual CAM modalities used, history of use prior to breast cancer 
diagnosis, frequency and duration of use, and specific reason(s) for use. Similarly, we do not 
have data on institutional and provider-level practices regarding recommendations on CAM 
therapy use prior to or during chemotherapy. The sample is largely from integrated health 
care systems, so the results may not be representative of chemotherapy initiation 
determinants in other populations.
Conclusions
In a prospective cohort study testing an a priori hypothesis, current dietary supplement use 
and number of CAM therapies used were associated with lower chemotherapy initiation 
after controlling for demographic and clinical factors. Though the majority of women with 
clinically indicated chemotherapy initiated treatment, 34 of 306 (11%) did not. A cautious 
interpretation of results may suggest to oncologists that it is beneficial to as-certain CAM 
use among their patients, especially dietary supplement use, and to consider CAM use as a 
potential marker of patients at risk of not initiating clinically indicated chemotherapy. This 
information can prompt further discussions between physicians and patients on 
chemotherapy expectations, with the common goal of addressing concerns and enhancing 
shared and informed decision making about clinically indicated chemotherapy. Future 
studies are needed to further distinguish the role of CAM in cancer management.

 Key Points
Question
Is the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) associated with decreased 
chemotherapy initiation among breast cancer patients?
Findings
In this cohort study of patients with early-stage breast cancer, use of dietary supplements 
and multiple CAM modalities were both associated with decreased initiation of clinically 
indicated chemotherapy. The use of mind-body practices was not associated with 
decreased chemotherapy initiation.
Meaning
Oncologists should discuss CAM use with their patients during the chemotherapy 
decision-making process as CAM use, especially dietary supplement use, may be an 
indicator of patients at risk for noninitiation of chemotherapy.
