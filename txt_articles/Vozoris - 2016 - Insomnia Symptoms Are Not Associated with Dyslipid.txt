Study Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine whether or not insomnia symptoms were associated with measured dyslipidemia.
Methods: This was a population-based multiyear cross-sectional study, using data from 2005–2008 United States National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Surveys. Survey participants ages 20 y and older self-reported the frequency of difficulty falling asleep, prolonged nocturnal awakening, and undesired 
early morning awakening over the preceding month. One-time venipuncture was performed and a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of ≥ 160 mg/
dL, triglycerides of ≥ 200 mg/dL, and a high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) of < 40 mg/dL denoted dyslipidemia. Descriptive statistics and multiple 
logistic regression were used.
Results: Data on LDL-C, triglycerides, and HDL-C was available for 4,635, 4,757, and 9,798 individuals, respectively. There were no significant associations 
between having any insomnia symptom at least five times in the past month and high LDL-C (odds ratio [OR] 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92–1.55) 
or low HDL-C (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82–1.04) in unadjusted analyses, or with high triglycerides after adjusting for covariates (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78–1.37). 
Recipients of sleeping pills who also had insomnia symptoms had significantly increased adjusted odds of elevated LDL-C (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.14–4.15).
Conclusions: Insomnia symptoms were generally not associated with dyslipidemia, but receipt of sleeping pills in the setting of insomnia was associated 
with elevated LDL-C. Further research is needed to confirm a possible link between sleeping pill use and dyslipidemia and to delineate if an association with 
atherosclerosis exists with specific types of sleeping pills or with all sedative medications more broadly.

INTRODUCTION
Insomnia symptoms (i.e., difficulty falling asleep, prolonged 
nocturnal awakening, and undesired early morning awak-
ening) are a common problem in the general population. It is 
estimated that insomnia symptoms occur in about 30% of the 
general American population five times per month or more.1–3 
Insomnia symptoms are commonly chronic in duration, with 
well over 50% of individuals reporting ongoing symptoms 
years after baseline assessment.4,5 Insomnia is associated with 
daytime fatigue, impaired daytime functioning, and decreased 
quality of life.6,7
There is a growing interest among the public and health care 
professionals to know whether or not insomnia might also be 
linked to the development of cardiovascular disease.8 Although 
not consistently demonstrated,9–11 insomnia has been found to 
be associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and 
sympathetic nervous system activation,12,13 which provides 
a biologic rationale for insomnia to possibly lead to the de-
velopment of coronary artery disease. Some previous studies 
have shown that insomnia symptoms are associated with sig-
nificantly increased risk of coronary artery-related events or 
mortality.14–20 However, many other studies have found no as-
sociation between insomnia symptoms and these outcomes.21–28 
Few studies have specifically evaluated for a possible link be-
tween insomnia symptoms and dyslipidemia.18,29 Zhan et al.29 
reported a 25% increased odds of elevated total cholesterol

Significance
Although some previous studies have reported that insomnia symptoms are associated with cardiovascular disease, this large, population-based study 
generally found no association between insomnia symptoms and measured dyslipidemia. No relationship between insomnia symptoms and dyslipidemia 
was found even when different markers of insomnia severity were considered, such as different categories of insomnia symptom frequency, the 
presence of concomitant daytime fatigue, and the presence of concomitant short sleep time. One notable and novel positive finding was that individuals 
with insomnia symptoms who were receiving sleeping pills were more likely to have elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol after adjusting for 
covariates. Further research is needed to confirm a possible link between sleeping pill use and dyslipidemia.
level among women experiencing insomnia symptoms three 
or more times per week compared to women experiencing no 
insomnia. If a true link between dyslipidemia and insomnia 
symptoms exists, this would potentially support the findings 
of some previous studies that reported a relationship between 
insomnia and coronary artery-related events or mortality. Fur-
thermore, if insomnia symptoms were found to be associated 
with dyslipidemia, this would have potentially important im-
plications on the management of insomnia patients.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate for a possible as-
sociation between insomnia symptoms and measured dyslipid-
emia using a large, population-level American database.
METHODS
Study Design
A population-based multiyear cross-sectional design was used.
Data Sources
This study combined data from the 2005–2006 and 2007–
2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 
(NHANES). The NHANES is a cross-sectional survey that 
is undertaken in the US by the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention every 2 y and each survey sample represents 
the total noninstitutionalized civilian US population residing 
in the 50 states and District of Columbia. Sociodemographic

and health information is collected from participants in person 
by trained professionals. Participants are interviewed in their 
homes and examined in a mobile examination centers where 
blood samples are obtained and physical examinations are 
performed. A detailed description of the survey design and 
methodology is available.30 Although NHANES databases are 
available prior to 2005–2006 and after 2007–2008, informa-
tion on sleep health was only collected for the 2005–2006 and 
2007–2008 NHANES cycles.
Identification of Insomnia Symptoms
NHANES participants were questioned regarding the fre-
quency of difficulty falling asleep, prolonged nocturnal awak-
ening, and undesired early morning awakening over the past 
month. These symptoms are contained in the insomnia defini-
tion of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis-
orders, 5th edition (DSM-V).31 Individuals were classified as 
having insomnia symptoms if they responded affirmatively to 
experiencing at least one of the following symptoms: difficulty 
falling asleep, prolonged nocturnal awakening, or undesired 
early morning awakening, at least five times in the past month. 
Although the presence of insomnia symptoms were established 
by self-report, clinical practice guidelines32 indicate that in-
somnia is primarily diagnosed by history and that polysom-
nography is not indicated in the routine evaluation of insomnia. 
Although insomnia symptom questions were asked of partici-
pants ages 16 y and older, individuals ages 20 y and older were 
included in this study because certain covariate data (e.g., edu-
cation level, smoking, alcohol use) was only available for this 
age group. Nonresponse to the insomnia questions was very 
low (< 0.3% of participants from both survey cycles) and these 
individuals were excluded.
Identification of Dyslipidemia
One-time venipuncture was performed on participants and 
the following were measured enzymatically: total cholesterol; 
triglycerides; and, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-
C). A description of the laboratory measurement method-
ology used is available.33 Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDL-C) was estimated from measured values of total choles-
terol, triglycerides, and HDL for participants who underwent 
a morning-time fasting blood draw of at least 8.5 h or more. 
LDL-C was estimated according to the Friedewald calculation: 
[LDL-C] = [total cholesterol] – [HDL-C] – [triglycerides/5].33 
Although LDL-C was calculated using the Friedewald equa-
tion, and not directly measured itself, this approach is com-
monly used in the ‘real-world’ and excellent correlation has 
been found between Friedewald and directly measured LDL-C 
in nonfasting individuals (coefficient = 0.97).34 Because the 
Friedewald equation may not be accurate when triglycerides 
are ≥ 400 mg/dL, individuals with such triglyceride levels 
were excluded from the LDL-C analysis (i.e., n = 122 or 2.6% 
of combined 2005–2008 NHANES samples). Although tri-
glyceride and HDL-C data from individuals who were not 
fasting were included when evaluating these two outcomes, 
nonfasting lipid levels have been found to have similar prog-
nostic value as fasting ones.35,36 An LDL ≥ 160 mg/dL (equiva-
lent to 4.14 mmol/L) and triglycerides ≥ 200 mg/dL (equivalent 
to 2.26 mmol/L) were selected as cutoffs to denote abnormal 
levels in this study, because both these lipid levels have been 
recognized as “high” by US national lipid guidelines.37,38 An 
HDL < 40 mg/dL (equivalent to 1.03 mmol/L) was selected 
as abnormal, because this HDL cutoff has been recognized as 
“low” by US national lipid guidelines.37 LDL-C, triglyceride, 
and HDL-C data were missing on 9.1%, 7.2%, and 9.1% of par-
ticipants from the two combined NHANES cycles.
Covariates
Based on a review of the literature, variables that were potential 
confounders, that is, associated with both insomnia and dyslip-
idemia, were identified.2,3,39–41 These variables are presented in 
the online supplement. One specific covariate that was consid-
ered was sleeping pill use. NHANES asked the following ques-
tion to survey participants: “In the past month, how often do 
you take sleeping pills or other medication to help you sleep?”. 
This question was not limited to any particular class(es) of sed-
atives and potentially included both prescription and over-the-
counter medications. Individuals who responded affirmatively 
to having used any sleeping pill one time or more in the past 
month were classified as having received sleeping pills.
Sensitivity Analyses
Several sensitivity analyses were performed and these are de-
scribed in the online supplement.
Statistical Analysis
Forced entry multiple logistic regression was used to ex-
amine the association between insomnia symptoms and high 
LDL-C, high triglycerides, and low HDL-C. Unadjusted odds 
ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were first cal-
culated. A second regression model was run for each dyslip-
idemia measure including the following covariates: sex, age, 
race, education level, total household income, ever smoking, 
alcohol consumption over the past year, depressed mood and 
anhedonia over the previous 2 w, body mass index, doctor-
diagnosed hypertension, current receipt of antihypertensive 
medication, doctor-diagnosed dyslipidemia, current receipt 
of lipid-lowering medication, doctor-diagnosed diabetes, cur-
rent receipt of diabetes pills or insulin, current receipt of any 
sleeping pill, and frequency of reported snoring and/or apneas. 
A third regression model was run, including all of the variables 
in the second model, plus frequency of reported daytime fa-
tigue and frequency of daytime sleepiness. Because symptoms 
of daytime fatigue and sleepiness are included on the Berlin 
Questionnaire that screens for obstructive sleep apnea, and 
yet they may also be consequences of insomnia, they were in-
cluded separately in a third regression model to evaluate for 
possible over-adjustment.
NHANES uses a complex sampling design, employing 
stratification and multistage clustering. To account for the un-
equal probabilities of selecting respondents, all point estimates 
were appropriately weighted using the survey sample weights 
provided. Combined new sample weights were appropriately 
created given that two NHANES cycles were used. To account 
for the effects of stratification and clustering on variance es-
timates, Taylor linearization procedures were performed on

all confidence intervals using stratum and cluster variables 
provided by NHANES. All analyses were performed on SAS 
version 9.3. Because this study involved analysis of legally 
and publically accessible anonymized data, research ethics 
approval was not needed as per the Tri-Council Policy State-
ment.42 Ethics approval to conduct NHANES and documented 
consent from survey participants was obtained by the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention.
RESULTS
Among individuals ages 20 y and older for whom insomnia 
data was available, data on LDL-C, triglycerides, and HDL-C 
was available for 4,635, 4,757, and 9,798 individuals, respec-
tively. From these total numbers, 10.7% had elevated LDL-C, 
16.3% had high triglycerides, and 22.1% had low HDL-C. So-
ciodemographic and health covariate data among individuals 
with and without insomnia symptoms are presented in Table 1.
There were no significant associations between having 
any insomnia symptom at least five times in the past month 
and high LDL-C, either before or after covariate adjustment, 
including when distinguishing by sex (Table 2). Insomnia 
symptoms were not associated with high LDL-C, when dis-
tinguishing by insomnia symptom subtype or by insomnia 
symptom frequency. There were no significant associations 
between insomnia symptoms and high LDL-C, regardless of 
the presence or not of diagnosed dyslipidemia or the recent 
receipt or not of lipid-lowering medication. There were also 
no significant associations between insomnia symptoms and 
high LDL-C, regardless of the presence or not of concomitant 
daytime fatigue or short sleep time. Among individuals who 
were not receiving sleeping pills, insomnia symptoms were not 
associated with high LDL-C. However, among recipients of 
sleeping pills, there were increased adjusted odds of elevated 
LDL-C among those with insomnia symptoms (OR 2.18, 95% 
CI 1.14–4.15).
In unadjusted analyses, having any insomnia symptom at 
least five times in the past month was associated with increased 
odds of high triglyceride level (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.03–1.48) 
(Table 3). However, this association became nonsignificant 
after adjusting for covariates (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.83–1.38). No 
significant association was observed between men with in-
somnia symptoms and high triglycerides. Among women with 
insomnia symptoms, there were significantly increased odds of 
high triglycerides even after adjusting for covariates (OR 1.65, 
95% CI 1.12–2.42), but this association was rendered nonsig-
nificant after additionally controlling for daytime fatigue and 
sleepiness symptoms (OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.97–2.30). However, 
among the subgroup of women experiencing insomnia symp-
toms 16 to 30 times in the past month, there were increased 
odds of elevated triglycerides, even after controlling for day-
time fatigue and sleepiness (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.19–3.30). Sleep 
initiation insomnia and sleep maintenance insomnia were as-
sociated with increased unadjusted odds of high triglyceride 
level, but these associations became nonsignificant after covar-
iate adjustment. Individuals having any insomnia symptom 16 
to 30 times in the past month had increased unadjusted odds 
of high triglycerides, but this association also became non-
significant after covariate adjustment. None of the remaining 
sensitivity analyses yielded significant results, including ones 
relating to the concomitant presence (or not) of daytime fatigue 
and short sleep time.
There were no significant associations between having any 
insomnia symptom at least five times in the past month and low 
HDL-C, either before or after covariate adjustment (Table 4). 
Among women with insomnia symptoms, there were signifi-
cantly increased unadjusted odds of low HDL-C (OR 1.43, 95% 
CI 1.17–1.75), but this became nonsignificant after adjusting for 
covariates (OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.94–1.67). No significant asso-
ciation was observed between men with insomnia symptoms 
and low HDL-C. The remaining sensitivity analyses yielded 
non-significant results.
DISCUSSION
Insomnia symptoms were generally not found to be associ-
ated with dyslipidemia. Negative results were observed even 
when considering different categories of insomnia symptom 
frequency, the presence (or not) of concomitant daytime fa-
tigue, and the presence (or not) of concomitant short sleep 
time, all of which would be considered markers of insomnia 
severity. One notable and novel positive finding was that 
individuals with insomnia symptoms who were receiving 
sleeping pills were 118% more likely to have elevated LDL-C 
after adjusting for covariates. In contrast, individuals with 
insomnia who were not receiving sleeping pills were no more 
likely to have elevated LDL-C compared to their nonin-
somnia counterparts.

Insomnia and Dyslipidemia—Vozoris
The results of this study are largely in keeping with the few 
other published studies on this topic.18,29 Using population-
level data from China involving more than 10,000 individ-
uals, Zhan et al.29 found no significant associations between 
insomnia symptoms and measured dyslipidemia whatsoever 
among men, and there were no significant associations be-
tween insomnia symptoms and high LDL-C, high triglycer-
ides, or low HDL-C among women.29 The only significant 
result was a 25% increased odds of elevated total cholesterol 
level among women experiencing insomnia symptoms greater 
than or equal to three times per week compared to those 
women experiencing no insomnia.29 However, Zhan et al.29 
did not adjust analyses for some potentially important con-
founders, such as sleeping pill use and obstructive sleep apnea. 
Although the current study did not examine for total choles-
terol, no significant associations between insomnia symptoms 
and dyslipidemia were found in subgroup analyses relating to 
sex or insomnia symptom frequency. In a small Taiwanese 
community-based sample, Chien et al.18 found that indi-
viduals experiencing insomnia symptoms nearly every day 
had, somewhat surprisingly, significantly lower total choles-
terol levels compared to those experiencing insomnia symp-
toms less often. There were no significant trends between 
increasing insomnia severity and LDL-C, triglyceride, and 
HDL-C levels.18
The finding that insomnia symptoms do not appear to be 
associated with dyslipidemia potentially calls into question 
whether a true relationship exists between insomnia symptoms 
and coronary artery-related events and mortality. Multiple pro-
spective cohort studies have previously reported that insomnia 
symptoms are not linked to coronary artery disease.21–28 
Among studies reporting an association between insomnia 
and coronary artery-related events or mortality, findings were 
often limited to specific subgroups, such as individuals ex-
periencing a particular insomnia symptom subtype14–16,20 or a 
particular frequency of insomnia symptoms.18–20 In the current 
study, subgroup analyses relating to insomnia symptom sub-
types and insomnia symptom frequency yielded negative re-
sults. Previous studies reporting a positive association between 
insomnia and coronary artery disease may be explained by the 
fact that analyses were not adjusted for some potentially impor-
tant confounders, such as obstructive sleep apnea and sleeping 
pills use. Obstructive sleep apnea is an important potential 
confounder because it is linked with both coronary artery dis-
ease and insomnia. An estimated 40% to 50% of individuals 
with obstructive sleep apnea have concomitant insomnia39 and

Insomnia and Dyslipidemia—Vozoris
an even higher proportion of individuals with insomnia may 
have coexisting obstructive sleep apnea.43 In the current study, 
analyses were adjusted for all the items contained in the Berlin 
Questionnaire, which is a validated screening instrument for 
obstructive sleep apnea,44 although no significant associations 
between insomnia and dyslipidemia were largely present even 
at the unadjusted level, before controlling for such variables. 
Sleeping pill use is another potential important confounder 
because it is associated with both insomnia and mortality,45,46 
although again in this study results were generally negative 
even before adjusting for this variable. Some previous studies 
included the experience of ‘nonrestorative sleep’ alone as 
qualification for having insomnia and reported significantly 
increased risk of coronary artery disease in relation to it.19,20 
The current study did not consider ‘nonrestorative sleep’ as an 
insomnia symptom, as this is a contentious issue in the sleep 
medicine community,47 with some advocating that ‘nonrestor-
ative sleep’ alone should be considered as something distinct 
from insomnia.47,48 Moreover, in contrast to the previous DSM-
IV definition of insomnia, the more recent DSM-V definition 
no longer considers ‘non-restorative sleep’ alone as indicative 
of insomnia.31 It is possible that there may still be a link be-
tween insomnia and coronary artery-related events or mortality, 
even though the relationship between and insomnia and dys-
lipidemia may be negative. For example, through hypothal-
amic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system 
activation, insomnia may predispose to either hypertension 
and/or diabetes, which may then in turn contribute to devel-
oping coronary artery disease. However, previous analyses 
of NHANES data2,3 and other population-level databases17,49 
have been mainly negative for a link between insomnia and 
hypertension.
The observations that sleeping pill use in the setting of 
insomnia is associated with significantly increased odds of 
LDL-C, but having insomnia symptoms and not receiving 
sleeping pills is not, are novel findings. Several previous popu-
lation-based studies have reported that sedative medication use 
is associated with increased all-cause mortality,45,46 but possible 
links with cardiovascular-specific mortality are unknown. The 
finding of elevated LDL-C levels among recipients of sleeping 
pills who have insomnia may in part explain the sedative medi-
cation-mortality association through possible increased coro-
nary artery-related events and mortality. The observed link 
between sleeping pill receipt and elevated LDL-C is particu-
larly concerning, given the dramatic rise in the use of seda-
tive medications in the general population in recent years.50,51

Insomnia and Dyslipidemia—Vozoris
It could be argued that the confounding by indication under-
lies the association between sleeping pill receipt and elevated 
LDL-C, that is, individuals receiving sleeping pills may have 
a greater severity of insomnia than those not using such medi-
cations, and therefore, the presence of more severe insomnia 
may be driving the finding of increased LDL-C. However, no 
association was observed between elevated LDL-C and other 
markers of insomnia severity in the current study (i.e., fre-
quent insomnia symptoms, insomnia symptoms coupled with 
daytime fatigue, and insomnia symptoms coupled with short 
sleep time).
Strengths of the current study are that it was based on recent, 
large, nationally representative US data, objective (and not 
patient-reported) measures of dyslipidemia were considered, a 
broad range of covariates were controlled for in the analysis, 
and multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted, including 
ones that evaluated for dyslipidemia among subgroups of in-
dividuals who likely had more severe insomnia. There are sev-
eral limitations. First, this study was based on cross-sectional 
and not longitudinal data. Second, it may be argued that gen-
erally no association was found between insomnia symptoms 
and dyslipidemia because dyslipidemia may develop over time 
in response to chronic insomnia and insomnia symptoms only 
within in the preceding month were considered in this study. 
However, the majority of individuals with insomnia symptoms 
in this study likely had long-standing symptoms, as previous 
studies have shown that the majority of insomnia is chronic 
in nature.4,5 Furthermore, individuals with combined insomnia 
and daytime fatigue may reflect a subgroup that more likely 
has insomnia of chronic duration and these individuals were 
at no further increased risk of dyslipidemia compared to the 
reference group. Third, because insomnia symptoms were 
self-reported in this study, there may be some degree of mis-
classification of individuals with and without insomnia due to 
recall or social desirability biases. However, the presence of 
insomnia symptoms in the ‘real world’ is established by pa-
tient report and not by some objective testing and this is sup-
ported by clinical practice guidelines.32 Fourth, analyses were 
adjusted by the items contained in the Berlin Questionnaire 
and not by polysomnography-confirmed obstructive sleep 
apnea. Nonetheless, the Berlin Questionnaire is a validated 
screening instrument for obstructive sleep apnea,44 and fur-
thermore, there were generally no associations observed be-
tween insomnia symptoms and dyslipidemia in unadjusted 
analyses, even before controlling for items contained in the 
Berlin Questionnaire. Fifth, it may be argued that the odds

Insomnia and Dyslipidemia—Vozoris
of women with insomnia symptoms having elevated triglyc-
erides becoming nonsignificant after additionally controlling 
for daytime fatigue and sleepiness reflects overadjustment, be-
cause daytime fatigue and sleepiness may be consequences of 
insomnia. This is an unavoidable limitation because daytime 
fatigue and sleepiness are also items contained in the Berlin 
Questionnaire that screens for obstructive sleep apnea. The 
absence of associations between women with insomnia symp-
toms and high LDL-C or low HDL-C favors that there is likely 
no true link between dyslipidemia and women experiencing 
insomnia. Finally, it was beyond the scope of the current study 
to delineate if elevated LDL-C was associated with the use of 
specific types of sleeping pills or with all sedative medications 
more broadly. Further research will need to be undertaken to 
clarify the possible link between receipt of sedative medica-
tions and dyslipidemia.
In conclusion, this study was generally negative for a rela-
tionship between insomnia symptoms and dyslipidemia, even 
when having considered different forms of dyslipidemia, dif-
ferent insomnia symptom subtypes, and different markers of 
insomnia severity (including symptom frequency, concomitant 
daytime fatigue, and concomitant short sleep time). The lack of 
an association between insomnia and dyslipidemia potentially 
calls into question whether a true relationship exists between 
insomnia symptoms and coronary artery-related events and 
mortality, as some previous studies have reported.14–20 Receipt 
of sleeping pills in the setting of insomnia was found to be 
associated with significantly increased elevated LDL-C, even 
after adjusting for many covariates, raising further and novel 
potential safety concerns regarding the use of sedative drugs. 
Further research is needed to confirm a possible link between 
sleeping pill use and dyslipidemia and to clarify if an associa-
tion with atherosclerosis exists for specific types of sleeping 
pills or with sedative pharmacotherapy more broadly.
