ABSTRACT
The current review clarifies the cardiometabolic health
effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) in adults.
A systematic search (PubMed) examining HIIT and
cardiometabolic health markers was completed on 15
October 2015. Sixty-five intervention studies were
included for review and the methodological quality of
included studies was assessed using the Downs and
Black score. Studies were classified by intervention
duration and body mass index classification. Outcomes
with at least 5 effect sizes were synthesised using a
random-effects meta-analysis of the standardised mean
difference (SMD) in cardiometabolic health markers
(baseline to postintervention) using Review Manager 5.3.
Short-term (ST) HIIT (<12 weeks) significantly improved
maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max; SMD 0.74, 95% CI
0.36 to 1.12; p<0.001), diastolic blood pressure (DBP;
SMD −0.52, 95% CI −0.89 to −0.16; p<0.01) and
fasting glucose (SMD −0.35, 95% CI −0.62 to −0.09;
p<0.01) in overweight/obese populations. Long-term (LT)
HIIT (≥12 weeks) significantly improved waist
circumference (SMD −0.20, 95% CI −0.38 to −0.01;
p<0.05), % body fat (SMD −0.40, 95% CI −0.74 to
−0.06; p<0.05), VO2 max (SMD 1.20, 95% CI 0.57 to
1.83; p<0.001), resting heart rate (SMD −0.33, 95%
CI −0.56 to −0.09; p<0.01), systolic blood pressure
(SMD −0.35, 95% CI −0.60 to −0.09; p<0.01) and
DBP (SMD −0.38, 95% CI −0.65 to −0.10; p<0.01)
in overweight/obese populations. HIIT demonstrated no
effect on insulin, lipid profile, C reactive protein or
interleukin 6 in overweight/obese populations. In normal
weight populations, ST-HIIT and LT-HIIT significantly
improved VO2 max, but no other significant effects were
observed. Current evidence suggests that ST-HIIT and
LT-HIIT can increase VO2 max and improve some
cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight/obese
populations.
INTRODUCTION
The WHO1 and the American College of Sports
Medicine (ACSM)2 recommend at least 150 min of
moderate-intensity
physical
activity
(40–60%
maximum oxygen uptake (VO2 max)3) or 75 min
of
vigorous-intensity
physical
activity
(60–85%
VO2 max) per week for healthy adults to maintain
or improve health. Despite the established thera-
peutic
potential
of
moderate-intensity
to
vigorous-intensity physical activity, 31.1% of the
adult worldwide (43% US population) fails to meet
the
minimum
physical
activity
guidelines.4
Frequently cited barriers to engagement in physical
activity are lack of time, low motivation and poor
adherence.5 6 To this end, several investigators7–9
have
examined
the
efficacy
of
high-intensity
interval training (HIIT; ≥85% VO2 max3) to main-
tain or improve health as an alternative to longer
duration, continuous, moderate-intensity to vigorous-
intensity physical activity approaches recommended
by the WHO and ACSM. One of the primary advan-
tages of HIIT
, compared to lesser-intensity exercise,
is that HIIT requires less time be spent exercising,
while providing similar or greater health-related ben-
efits,
compared
to
established
physical
activity
recommendations.10
11 As a result, it has been
theorised that HIIT can mitigate the most com-
monly cited barrier to physical activity which is
‘lack of time’.5 6
Interval training refers to intermittent exercise
that involves alternating short bursts of higher-
intensity activity with lower-intensity activity for
recovery or rest.3 12 HIIT is an enhanced form of
interval
training
involving
brief,
high-intensity,
anaerobic exercise (ranging from 85% to 250%
VO2 max for 6 s to 4 min) separated by brief, but
slightly longer bouts of low-intensity aerobic rest
(ranging from 20% to 40% VO2 max for 10 s to
5 min).13 Numerous studies have demonstrated
greater health-related benefits from HIIT compared
to traditional moderate-intensity continuous train-
ing (MICT).14–17 Compared with MICT
, HIIT has
been reported to more effectively increase aerobic
capacity (VO2 max)14–17 and reduce risk factors
associated
with
metabolic
syndrome,
including
blood pressure (BP),17 insulin action16 and lipogen-
esis,16 in a variety of patient populations. Recent
systematic reviews and meta-analyses have reported
HIIT
, compared to MICT
, can significantly increase
peak oxygen uptake in individuals with lifestyle-
induced cardiometabolic diseases18 and to stimulate
modest improvements in VO2 max compared to
pretraining values in active non-athletic and seden-
tary individuals.19
As such, HIIT is a promising method by which
to reduce cardiometabolic risk factors.20 However,
reviews of HIIT
, compared to MICT
, to date have
focused on cardiorespiratory fitness18 19 21 and vas-
cular function.22 A single meta-analysis23 of six
studies examined the effect of HIIT on traditional
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in indivi-
duals with cardiometabolic disorders and found
HIIT and MICT to have similar effects on meta-
bolic risk factors (body composition, BP
, lipid
profile and glucose). However, no review, to date,
has sought to provide an extensive review of the
effect of HIIT on traditional and novel markers of

 CVD risk factors such as inflammation. The need for a system-
atic review/meta-analysis examining the efficacy of HIIT on
markers of cardiometabolic health is particularly relevant as a
growing number of individuals who develop CVD, despite the
absence of traditional CVD risk factors (ie, hypertension, ele-
vated blood glucose and high cholesterol).24 Additionally, the
higher exertion and unique pattern of HIIT may induce changes
in novel markers of CVD risk. For example, high-intensity exer-
cise has been shown to reduce disease-related inflammation
(interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α) in
animals.25 Therefore, to further examine the potential benefit of
HIIT
, this study will include novel markers of CVD risk which
previous reviews have not examined.
Therefore,
we
conducted
a
systematic
review
and
meta-analysis to synthesise the effects of HIIT on cardiometa-
bolic health markers, including body mass, waist circumference
(WC),
hip
circumference
(HC),
body
mass
index
(BMI),
waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), % body fat, resting heart rate (HR),
BP
, VO2 max, fasting glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin, insulin,
total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol,
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, C
reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, TNF-α, TNF receptor-1 (TNFR1)
and TNF receptor-2 (TNFR2) in adults.
METHODS
A systematic search of clinical trials, randomised controlled
trials, controlled clinical trials and comparative studies was ini-
tially performed on 25 March 2015 and completed on 15
October 2015 based on the PRISMA guidelines26 following the
protocol of a systematic review on physical activity.27 Articles
were retrieved from PubMed using the following search criteria:
(high intensity interval training OR high-intensity interval train-
ing OR high intensity interval exercise OR high-intensity inter-
val
exercise
OR
high

intermittent
exercise
OR
high-intensity intermittent exercise OR sprint interval training
OR HIIT OR HIIE) AND (fasting plasma glucose OR glycosy-
lated hemoglobin OR HbA1c OR triglycerides OR insulin OR

ratio OR resting heart rate OR per cent body fat OR lean body
mass OR resting blood pressure OR maximum heart rate OR
VO2 max) AND Humans[MeSH] AND Adult[MeSH] AND
English[lang].
Initially, titles and abstracts of identified articles were checked
for relevance by two reviewers (RBB and PST). Subsequently,
the reviewers independently reviewed the full text of potentially
eligible papers. Any disagreement between the reviewers for
inclusion was resolved through discussion. Additional articles
were identified via hand-searching and reviewing the reference
lists of relevant papers. Figure 1 presents the flow of papers
through the study selection process.
Studies were considered to be eligible for inclusion according
to the following criteria: (1) participants were ≥18 years of age.

 (2) The study examined at least one of the following cardiome-
tabolic health markers in humans: body mass, WC, HC, BMI,
WHR, % body fat, HR, BP
, VO2 max, fasting glucose, glycosy-
lated haemoglobin, insulin, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol,
HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, CRP
, IL-6, TNF-α, TNFR1 or
TNFR2. (3) The study employed an intervention (randomised
or non-randomised) of either short-term (ST-HIIT; <12 weeks)
or long-term (LT-HIIT; ≥12 weeks) HIIT defined as activities
with intermittent bouts of activity that were performed at
maximal effort, ≥85% VO2 max, ≥85% HR reserve or the rela-
tive intensity of at least 90% HR max.3
28 (4) The study
included a HIIT session lasting ≤4 min/set interspersed with an
interval of rest or active recovery. (5) The study included quanti-
tative analyses (statistical comparisons of the intervention to
baseline/pretraining values) of the effect of HIIT on at least one
of the outcome measures mentioned above (criteria ii). (6) The
study reported baseline BMI of HIIT participants or baseline
BMI can be calculated from the provided data. (7) The article
was published or accepted for publication in a refereed journal
from 1970 up to the search date. (8) The study was published
in English. To differentiate the effect of HIIT duration on cardi-
ometabolic markers, a classification of ST-HIIT (<12 weeks)
and LT-HIIT (≥12 weeks) based on previous studies20 29 30 was
used in this review.
T
wo authors (RBB and PST) independently assessed the
quality of the studies that met the inclusion criteria (table 1).
The risk of bias and strength of evidence from individual studies
were assessed using the Downs and Black Checklist,31 which
uses a scoring system to assess the strength of reporting, external
validity, internal validity and statistical power. The maximum
score that can be received is 32. Adapted from another system-
atic review,32 the score obtained by each study was divided by
32
and
multiplied
by
100
to
provide
a
‘Study
Quality
Percentage’. Study quality percentages were then classified as
high (66.7% or higher), fair (between 50.0% and 66.6%) and
low (<50.0%).32
Studies were stratified based on the duration of the training
intervention and BMI classification. Mean BMI values were clas-
sified as follows: normal weight (18.5–24.99 kg/m2), overweight
(≥25–29.99 kg/m2) and obese (≥30 kg/m2).33 For outcome
markers examined in five or more studies, a meta-analysis was
conducted
in

using
the
inverse-
variance statistical method. Previous meta-analyses have applied
a
minimum
of
five
effect
sizes
to
be
included
in
the
meta-analysis.34
35 Too few studies of LT-HIIT with normal
weight participants were available for meta-analysis. In instances
where insufficient statistical information was reported to calcu-
late mean change in health markers (ie, relevant measurements
had been taken but the pretraining and post-training values
were not reported or were presented in graphs), the authors
were contacted and asked to provide the missing data. When no
reply was received, the study/outcome was excluded from the
meta-analysis. The effect size of the standardised mean differ-
ence (SMD) in cardiometabolic health markers from preinter-
vention to postintervention in each study was calculated and
pooled using the random-effects model (appropriate for data
gathered from the published literature). Effect sizes were quanti-
fied as large (>0.8 SMD), medium (0.5 SMD–0.8 SMD) small
(0.2
SMD–0.5
SMD)
or
non-significant
(<0.2
SMD).36
Heterogeneity of included studies was assessed using the I2 stat-
istic with heterogeneity estimates of 25%, 50% and 75% repre-
senting low, moderate and high heterogeneity, respectively. The
significance level was set at p<0.05.
Where significant heterogeneity was found, meta-regression
was performed using Comprehensive Meta-analysis V
.3 (Biostat,
New Jersey, USA) in an attempt to determine whether inter-
vention duration, total HIIT time used (min), BMI and base-
line level of the outcome variable mediated the observed
changes. Total HIIT time was calculated by multiplying
session duration (HIIT in minutes×number of repetitions,
maximum repetition was used for studies where range was
provided) by the frequency and duration of intervention.
Intervention duration, total HIIT time used (min), BMI and
baseline levels were used since these factors are likely to
impact the outcome variables.
Where meta-analysis is not possible due to insufficient
studies, a modified form of coding system described by Sallis
et al37 was used to summarise the studies reporting the effect of
HIIT on cardiometabolic markers. If 0–33% of the studies
reported a statistically significant difference between HIIT and
cardiometabolic markers, the result was categorised as no effect
(0). If 34–59% of the studies reported a statistically significant
difference, the result was categorised as inconsistent (?). If 60–
100% of the studies reported a statistically significant difference,
the result was rated as positive (+) or negative (−), respective of
the direction of the effect. When four or more studies sup-
ported a difference or no difference, it was coded as ++, −− or
00 to indicate consistent observations. The ?? code indicated a
marker that has been examined in four or more studies with
inconsistent findings.
RESULTS
The search identified 212 articles published between the years
1981 and October 2015. Of these, 138 articles were excluded
as they were not relevant to the scope of this review. Of the
remaining 74 articles, 43 met the inclusion criteria and were
included in the review. An additional 22 articles were identified
through the reference lists of the included studies. As a result,
65 studies were included in the final analysis.
General study characteristics are summarised in table 1; more
detailed
study
characteristics
are
presented
in
online
supplementary table S1, and the effects of ST-HIIT and LT-HIIT
on cardiometabolic health markers reported in each study are
presented in online supplementary tables S2 and S3, respect-
ively. All studies included in this analysis employed a HIIT inter-
vention. The number of study participants in HIIT groups
ranged from 5 to 85. Generally, participants were young (18–
35 years old) men and women. The HIIT protocols ranged
from an acute single session (a single 30 min bout of HIIT) to
longer term multiple sessions (four HIIT sessions, lasting 4 min
per session, three times per week for 52 weeks). Exercise modal-
ities
included
treadmill
running,
swimming
and
cycling.
Nineteen of 65 (29%) studies examined HIIT in participants
with a current medical condition (hypertension, diabetes, meta-
bolic syndrome, post myocardial infarction, coronary artery
disease and patients who had a transplanted heart). Thirty-seven
of 65 (57%) studies examined HIIT in overweight/obese partici-
pants, based on BMI. The summary estimates of the effect of
ST-HIIT and LT-HIIT on cardiometabolic health variables in
normal weight and overweight/obese populations are provided
in figures 2 and 3. Forest plots on the effects of ST-HIIT and
LT-HIIT on cardiometabolic markers are provided in online
supplementary figures S1–S4. Table 2 provides a summary
coding of the studies (not included in the meta-analysis) report-
ing the effect of ST-HIIT and LT-HIIT on cardiometabolic
health markers.

 HIIT and body composition measures
ST-HIIT showed no effect on body mass (SMD −0.02, 95% CI
−0.23 to 0.19; p=0.87), BMI (SMD −0.05 95% CI −0.39 to
0.29; p=0.77) and % body fat (SMD −0.07, 95% CI −0.36 to
0.21; p=0.62) in normal weight populations, with no significant
heterogeneity across studies for body mass, BMI and % body fat
(I2=0%; p=1.0 for all outcomes). Similarly, ST-HIIT showed no
effect on body mass (SMD −0.04, 95% CI −0.29 to 0.20;
p=0.72) and % body fat (SMD −0.14, 95% CI −0.48 to 0.20;
p=0.42) in overweight/obese populations, with no significant
heterogeneity across studies (I2=0%; p=1.0). The summary
coding revealed no evidence for the effect of ST-HIIT on WC in
normal weight populations and no evidence for the effect of
ST-HIIT on BMI in overweight/obese populations. Conversely,
summary coding showed that ST-HIIT reduced WC in over-
weight/obese populations.
There were insufficient studies to examine the effect of
LT-HIIT on body composition in normal weight populations.
LT-HIIT reduced WC (SMD −0.20, 95% CI −0.38 to −0.01;
p<0.05) and % body fat (SMD −0.40, 95% CI −0.74 to
−0.06; p<0.05) by a small effect in overweight/obese popula-
tions, with no significant heterogeneity across studies (I2=0%;
p=0.74 for WC, I2=24%; p=0.25 for % body fat). However,
LT-HIIT showed no effect on body mass (SMD −0.07, 95% CI
−0.23 to 0.08; p=0.37) and BMI (SMD −0.14, 95% CI −0.32
to 0.04; p=0.12) in overweight/obese populations, with no sig-
nificant heterogeneity across studies (I2=0%; p=0.95 for body
mass, I2=0%; p=0.62 for BMI). Furthermore, summary coding
revealed that the effect of LT-HIIT on WHR was inconsistent in
overweight/obese populations.
HIIT and cardiorespiratory measures
ST-HIIT increased VO2 max (SMD 0.83, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.10;
p<0.00001) by a large effect in normal weight populations and
increased VO2 max (SMD 0.74, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.12;
p<0.001) by a medium effect in overweight/obese populations,
with
no
significant
heterogeneity
across
studies
(I2=0%;
p=0.52 for normal weight; I2=0%; p=0.62 for overweight/
obese). While the summary coding revealed that LT-HIIT
increased VO2 max in normal weight populations. LT-HIIT
improved VO2 max (SMD 1.20, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.83;
p<0.001) by a large effect in overweight/obese populations,
with significant heterogeneity across studies (I2=73%; p<0.01).
ST-HIIT showed no effect on resting HR (SMD −0.21, 95%
CI −0.55 to 0.14; p=0.24) in normal weight populations, with
no significant heterogeneity across studies (I2=0%; p=0.81).
There was no evidence in the summary coding for the effect of
ST-HIIT on resting HR in overweight/obese populations and no
evidence for the effect of LT-HIIT on resting HR in normal
weight populations. In contrast, LT-HIIT decreased resting HR
(SMD −0.33, 95% CI −0.56 to −0.09; p<0.01) by a small
effect in overweight/obese populations, with no significant het-
erogeneity across studies (I2=43%; p=0.07).
ST-HIIT showed no effect on systolic BP (SBP; SMD −0.01,
95% CI −0.36 to 0.33; p=0.95) and diastolic BP (DBP; SMD
−0.15, 95% CI −0.50 to 0.19; p=0.39) in normal weight popu-
lations, with no significant heterogeneity across studies (I2=0%;
p=0.91 for SBP; I2=0%; p=0.98 for DBP). While ST-HIIT
showed no effect on SBP (SMD −0.28, 95% CI −0.64 to 0.08;
p=0.12) and decreased DBP (SMD −0.52, 95% CI −0.89 to
−0.16; p<0.01) by a medium effect in overweight/obese popu-

inconsistent in normal weight populations. LT-HIIT decreased
SBP (SMD −0.35, 95% CI −0.60 to −0.09; p<0.01) and DBP
(SMD −0.38, 95% CI −0.65 to −0.10; p<0.01) by a small

HIIT and glucose metabolism measures
The summary coding revealed that the evidence for the effect of
ST-HIIT on fasting glucose was inconsistent and no evidence for
the effect of ST-HIIT on fasting insulin in normal weight
populations.
Alternatively,
ST-HIIT reduced
fasting glucose
(SMD −0.35, 95% CI −0.62 to −0.09; p<0.01) by a small
effect and showed no effect on fasting insulin (SMD −0.05,

tions, with no significant heterogeneity across studies (I2=0%,
p=0.51 for fasting glucose; I2=0%, p=0.95 for fasting insulin).
The summary coding revealed no evidence for the effect of
LT-HIIT on fasting glucose in normal weight populations.
Similarly, LT-HIIT demonstrated no effect on fasting glucose
(SMD −0.15, 95% CI −0.34 to 0.04; p=0.11) in overweight/
obese populations, with no significant heterogeneity across
studies (I2=0%; p=1.0). There was no evidence in the summary

 coding for the effect of LT-HIIT on fasting insulin and HbA1c
in overweight/obese populations.
HIIT and blood lipid measures
The summary coding revealed that the evidence for the effect of
ST-HIIT on total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol was inconsist-
ent and no evidence for the effect of ST-HIIT on HDL choles-
terol and triglycerides in normal weight populations. There was
no evidence in the summary coding for the effect of ST-HIIT on
total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and trigly-
cerides in overweight/obese populations. The summary coding
revealed no evidence for the effect of LT-HIIT on total choles-
terol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides in normal weight
populations. LT-HIIT demonstrated no effect on total choles-
terol (SMD 0.07, 95% CI −0.14 to 0.28; p=0.51), HDL chol-
esterol (SMD 0.20, 95% CI −0.01 to 0.40; p=0.06), LDL
cholesterol (SMD 0.09, 95% CI −0.13 to 0.31; p=0.42) and
triglycerides (SMD −0.04, 95% CI −0.23 to 0.15; p=0.67) in
overweight/obese populations, with no significant heterogeneity
across studies (I2=0%, p=0.73 for total cholesterol; I2=6%,
p=0.38 for HDL; I2=0%, p=0.93 for LDL; I2=0%, p=0.91
for triglycerides).
HIIT and inflammation measures
The summary coding revealed that the evidence for the effect of
ST-HIIT on IL-6 was inconsistent in normal weight populations.
There was no evidence in the summary coding for the effect of
LT-HIIT on IL-6 in overweight/obese populations. LT-HIIT
showed no effect on CRP (SMD −0.09, 95% CI −0.30 to 0.12;
p=0.39) in overweight/obese populations, with no significant
heterogeneity across studies (I2=0%; p=0.94).
Meta-regression
Table 3 shows the β-coefficients and CIs for the meta-regression
analyses. Intervention duration, total HIIT time used (min),
BMI and baseline level of the outcome variable did not predict
the improvements observed in SBP and DBP
. Intervention dur-
ation (β (95% CI)=0.77 (0.35, 1.18); R2=0.94) and BMI (β
(95% CI)=0.84 (0.29, 1.38); R2=0.73) predicted changes in
VO2 max. Greater increases in VO2 max were associated with
longer intervention duration and higher BMI.
DISCUSSION
Results suggest that HIIT is an effective intervention to improve
cardiometabolic
health
in
overweight/obese
populations.
Specifically, ST-HIIT beneficially influenced WC, VO2 max,
fasting glucose and DBP
, whereas LT-HIIT was found to benefi-
cially influence WC, % body fat, VO2 max, resting HR, SBP
and DBP in overweight/obese populations.
Meta-analysis of ST-HIIT revealed no significant effect on
body composition in normal weight populations, whereas too
few studies are currently available examining the effect of
LT-HIIT in normal weight populations. ST-HIIT reduced WC in
overweight/obese
populations
and
LT-HIIT
significantly
improved WC and % body fat in overweight/obese populations.
The average change in WC was 2.13 cm for ST-HIIT and
2.23 cm for LT-HIIT
, both above the cut-off value of >2 cm
WC decrease which is suggested to confer improvements in
metabolic syndrome risk factors.98 These findings suggest that
HIIT is an effective stimulus for reducing body fat levels (even
in the absence of weight loss) for those individuals with large
fat mass. Possible mechanisms underlying HIIT-induced fat loss
include generation of catecholamines that increased fat oxida-
tion and fat release from visceral fat stores, decreased postexer-
cise
appetite
and
increased
excess
postexercise
oxygen
consumption resulting in an elevated fat loss state.99 100 A cat-
echolamine response has been shown to be significantly elevated
after HIIT
.101
102 Since β3-adrenergic receptors are located
mainly in the adipose tissue103 and β-adrenergic receptor sensi-
tivity in adipose tissue is increased following exercise,104 these
factors might explain why HIIT is effective in reducing body fat
in overweight/obese individuals. One intriguing finding is the
absence of weight loss despite observed decrease in body fat,
this is likely to be a consequence of gain in muscle mass. HIIT is
known to recruit more fast type II muscle fibres leading to
greater muscle hypertrophy and muscle mass.105 106 This adap-
tation is likely to induce health benefits as increase in muscle
mass improves insulin sensitivity.107 As an example, elevated
muscle mass was found positively associated with reduced inci-
dence of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.108
109
Thus, if HIIT can be successfully implemented in settings
outside of clinical trials, it may offer an additional strategy to
assist with adipose reduction in overweight/obese populations.
However, more studies are required to determine whether HIIT
could be a successful population-based strategy for producing
health adaptations.
Results from meta-analysis consistently revealed that ST-HIIT
significantly improved VO2 max by medium effects to large
effects in normal weight (SMD 0.83, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.10;
p<0.00001) and overweight/obese (SMD 0.74, 95% CI 0.36 to
1.12; p<0.001) populations, with an aggregate improvement of
3.80 and 4.43 mL/kg/min, respectively. The summary coding
revealed that LT-HIIT increased VO2 max in normal weight
populations, whereas the meta-analysis showed that LT-HIIT sig-
nificantly improved VO2 max by large effects in overweight
obese (SMD 1.20, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.83; p<0.001) populations
with an aggregate improvement of 6.04 mL/kg/min. These find-
ings are similar to previous meta-analyses which have demon-
strated that HIIT improves aerobic fitness by moderate effects to
large effects (Hedges’ g=0.63, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.87; SMD
0.86, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.99) in healthy sedentary and recreation-
ally active young adults12 19 21 110 and in adults with cardiome-
tabolic disorders.18 23 Notably, ST-HIIT and LT-HIIT improve
VO2 max in normal weight and overweight/obese populations

 with larger gains observed for longer training periods. This has
implications for the use of HIIT as part of lifestyle modification
strategies and is consistent with training responses to stimuli.
The ability of ST-HIIT and LT-HIIT has clinical applications in
individuals that need to improve their aerobic fitness as HIIT is
able to increase VO2 max rapidly via increasing mitochondrial
density, resulting in the generation of more ATP for working
muscles, thereby producing greater force generation for a longer
duration.111 HIIT is also able to increase stroke volume induced
by increased cardiac contractility64 and increase skeletal muscle
diffusive capacity,112 thus improving aerobic capacity.
This review also found LT-HIIT to significantly decrease
resting HR in overweight/obese populations, but not in normal
weight populations subjected to LT-HIIT and in normal weight/
overweight/obese
populations
subjected
to
ST-HIIT
.
The
decrease in resting HR following LT-HIIT may be explained by
increased stroke volume64 and improved cardiac autonomic
function via increased baroreflex-mediated modulation of the
sinoatrial node.113 Taken together, these improvements in car-
diorespiratory fitness (VO2 max) and HR response provided by
HIIT are important since both are independent predictors of all-
cause and CVD mortality.114–116
BP is another commonly assessed measure related to cardio-
vascular health. ST-HIIT showed no significant effect on SBP
and DBP in normal weight populations. While ST-HIIT showed
no significant effect on SBP in normal weight and overweight/
obese populations, ST-HIIT significantly improved DBP in over-
weight/obese
populations
with
an
average
reduction
of
4.74 mm Hg. This lack of change observed in SBP following
ST-HIIT is perhaps due to the fact that most of the participants
in this group were middle aged to older aged (40.9–62.9 years
old), and it is well known that SBP increases progressively with
age.117 It is possible that longer HIIT intervention periods are
required to produce a significant effect in SBP in this popula-
tion. This is supported by the observation that LT-HIIT signifi-
cantly decreased SBP and DBP in overweight/obese populations.
The average reduction is 4.57 mm Hg for SBP and 2.94 mm Hg
for DBP
, above 4 mm Hg SBP reduction which is expected to
decrease CVD mortality by 5–20%.118 The findings of the
current study demonstrate the beneficial impact of HIIT in over-
weight/obese populations. The mechanisms responsible for the
BP lowering effect of HIIT may result from intensity-dependent
increases to blood flow velocity, resulting in increased levels of
endothelial nitric oxide (NO).119 120 Increases in endothelial
NO availability and bioactivity improve NO-dependent vaso-
dilation in the vasculature, resulting in improved peripheral
compliance and decreased BP
.121
ST-HIIT and LT-HIIT showed no significant effect on glucose/
insulin response in normal weight populations. No changes in
fasting glucose/insulin were observed in overweight/obese popu-
lations subjected to LT-HIIT
, but a decrease in fasting glucose
was observed in overweight/obese populations subjected to
ST-HIIT
. The reason for improvement in glucose response in
ST-HIIT is not fully known, but activation of AMP-activated
kinase (AMPK) has been shown to increase glucose uptake in
skeletal muscle via increased translocation of GLUT4.122 123
Interestingly, no significant effect was observed in glucose/
insulin response following LT-HIIT in overweight/obese popula-
tions. One explanation is that all the LT-HIIT studies that exam-
ined glucose metabolism were conducted in participants with a
pre-existing medical condition (coronary artery disease, meta-
bolic syndrome and hypertension) that is known to independ-
ently influence glucose metabolism, thus possibly obscuring the
effect of HIIT on glucose metabolism.
There was no evidence to suggest that ST-HIIT and LT-HIIT
influence blood lipids in normal weight and overweight/obese
populations. Although the exact cause is unknown, a possible
explanation is that HIIT decreases fatty acid release in the circu-
lation due to decreased blood flow in adipose tissue mediated
by α2-adrenergic receptors during high plasma catecholamine
concentrations.124
This
is
an
area
that
requires
further
examination.
The role of inflammation in diabetes and CVD risk is increas-
ingly acknowledged.125 Inflammation contributes to the devel-
opment of CVD by narrowing arteries126 and diabetes by
promoting insulin resistance.127 ST-HIIT demonstrated no effect
on IL-6 in normal weight populations, whereas LT-HIIT demon-
strated no effect on CRP and IL-6 in overweight/obese popula-
tions. One LT-HIIT study reported improvements in TNF-α in
obese, middle-aged to older-aged adults. At present, the effect
of HIIT on inflammation is not clear. The small number of
studies combined with the varied populations made synthesis of
studies difficult. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the dur-
ation of individual bouts of exercise is the single most important
factor that determines the magnitude of the systemic IL-6
response.128 The short bouts of exercise used in some of the
studies included in this review may not be long enough to elicit
a pronounced IL-6 response despite the high intensity of HIIT
.
Thus, studies addressing these issues are encouraged to better
understand the impact of HIITon inflammatory markers.
This review demonstrates that HIIT performed <12 weeks
and ≥12 weeks can significantly improve VO2 max in normal
weight and overweight/obese populations, <12 weeks of HIIT
can significantly improve WC, fasting glucose and DBP in over-
weight/obese populations and at least 12 weeks of HIIT appears
to promote significant reductions in WC, % body fat, resting
HR, SBP and DBP in overweight/obese populations. However,
despite the results observed for ST-HIIT and LT-HIIT in over-
weight/obese populations, there were too few studies of LT-HIIT
in normal weight populations. The number of health-related ben-
efits elicited by HIIT in overweight/obese populations is possibly
related to the changes in fat mass following HIIT
. Another
explanation is that increase in adipose tissue induces metabolic
dysregulation
increasing
responsiveness
to
HIIT
.
However,
although improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness and body
composition were observed, there were no evidence to suggest
that lipid metabolism and inflammatory markers are influenced
by ST-HIIT or LT-HIIT
, possibly due to the different metabolic
consequences of the different HIIT protocols causing different
metabolic adaptations. The challenge therefore for future research
is to identify the optimal length, work-to-rest ratio of HIIT that
would provide maximum health benefit.
There are some limitations to this meta-analysis. The effect of
sprint interval training (HIIT above 100% VO2 max) separate to
HIIT was not examined and is a potential area for future
reviews. Most studies included are of low (16/65) to fair (46/65)
quality and used relatively small sample sizes. The substantial
heterogeneity found in several meta-analysed health markers
(WC, VO2 max, HR, SBP and DBP) suggests differences in
population cohorts and study design as possible sources. This
issue was addressed by stratifying the results by study duration
and BMI, and by performing a meta-regression. Additional
studies conducted in larger and more diverse samples are
required to address these limitations of primary studies.
CONCLUSION
Findings of this review indicate that HIIT may constitute an
effective training protocol for improving VO2 max and several

 cardiometabolic risk factors such as WC, % body fat, resting
HR, SBP
, DBP and fasting glucose in overweight/obese popula-
tions. Taken as a whole, in overweight/obese populations, per-
forming
HIIT results
in
significant,
positive,
physiological
adaptations that improve cardiometabolic
health
and
may
reduce the development and progression of disease-related risk
factors that are associated with overweight/obesity and low
aerobic fitness. However, whether these metabolic adaptations
following LT-HIIT extend to normal weight populations still
needs further examination.
As HIIT activity regime requires minimal time commit-
ment, HIIT may serve as a time-efficient substitute or as a
compliment to commonly recommended MICT in improving
cardiometabolic health. Clinicians are encouraged (after an
appropriate pre-exercise screening and under supervised con-
ditions) to use HIIT performed at least three times a week for
12 weeks as part of their exercise programme to enhance car-
diorespiratory fitness and to reduce body fat in overweight/
obese populations.
What are the findings?
▸ At least 12 weeks of high-intensity interval training (HIIT)
improves cardiometabolic risk factors such as waist
circumference, % body fat, resting heart rate, systolic blood
pressure and diastolic blood pressure in overweight/obese
populations.
▸ Improvements in aerobic capacity are larger with longer
training periods.
▸ The effect of HIIT on inflammation is not clear due to the
limited number of studies available.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
▸ High-intensity interval training (HIIT) performed at least
3 times a week for 12 weeks results in significant,
positive, physiological adaptations that improve
cardiometabolic health in overweight/obese
populations.
▸ HIIT may reduce the development and progression of
disease-related risk factors that are associated with
overweight/obesity and low aerobic fitness.
▸ HIIT may be especially attractive to overweight/obese
populations interested in improving cardiometabolic health
but with limited time available.
