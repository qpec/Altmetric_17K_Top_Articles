Physiotherapy and physical activity: a
cross-sectional survey exploring
physical activity promotion, knowledge
of physical activity guidelines and the
physical activity habits of UK
physiotherapists

ABSTRACT
Objective Physical inactivity is a public health priority
and embedding promotion of physical activity (PA)
within healthcare systems is an important lever for
change. Many factors influence PA promotion in
routine healthcare practice; these include the PA habits
of healthcare professionals and also their knowledge of
the PA guidelines. Little is known about the extent to
which PA is currently promoted in physiotherapy
practice or the factors that influence it.
Methods Following ethical approval, a cross-sectional
survey of UK physiotherapists was conducted. Findings
were analysed and reported in accordance with
STROBE (STrengthening the Reporting of
OBservational studies in Epidemiology) guidelines.
Results There were 522 respondents, 514 of whom
were physiotherapists. Seventy-seven per cent of
respondents routinely discussed PA with patients and
68% routinely delivered brief interventions.
Assessment of PA status was not routine practice,
neither was signposting to further sources of PA
support. Only 16% of respondents correctly answered
questions about the content of the PA guidelines. Only
38% of respondents met current PA recommendations.
Clinicians’ PA levels were not associated with PA
promotion activity.
Conclusion Despite the promising finding that some
form of PA promotion is integrated into most
respondents’ practice, we report a poor understanding
of brief interventions and poor knowledge of the PA
guidelines. Additionally, the majority of respondents
were not sufficiently active to meet current PA
recommendations.
BACKGROUND
Physical
inactivity
(PI),
defined
as
achieving less than 30 min physical activity
(PA) per week,1 has a significant impact
on morbidity and mortality which leads to
economic
burden
on
healthcare
systems
and
wider
society.2
3
Inactive
people
spend 38% more days in hospital and use
significantly
more
healthcare
resources
than active people.4 Accordingly, there is
national
and
international
guidance
on
how PA can be promoted.5–7
What are the new findings?
" Discussions about physical activity (PA) were
integrated into the majority of physiotherapy
contacts.
" Brief
interventions
may
not
be
carried
out
optimally.
& PA status of patients was not routinely
assessed.
& Although 60% of physiotherapists knew that
150 min of moderate PA per week is recom-
mended,
only
16%
of
physiotherapists
successfully
answered
all
three
questions
relating to the PA guidelines.
& Physiotherapists did not routinely signpost to
further sources of PA support.
" The majority of physiotherapists were not suffi-
ciently active to meet the current PA guidelines
for adults.
How might it impact on clinical practice in
the near future?
" To maximise the potential impact of physio-
therapy on physical inactivity we recommend.
" Further efforts to disseminate the current PA
guidelines.
" Targeted knowledge translation of brief interven-
tions for PA in a physiotherapy context.

 Many factors influence PA at population level and
meaningful change requires sustained efforts across
multiple systems.8 Healthcare is one such system and
integrating PA promotion into healthcare is one of the
seven ‘best investments’ for reducing PI.9
Every healthcare contact is an opportunity to posi-
tively influence a patient’s health and this is often done
pragmatically through brief interventions. Brief inter-
ventions for PA can be delivered in routine healthcare
consultations; they have the potential to reach a large
proportion of the adult population and have been
shown
to
be
cost-effective.10
11
Clinical
guidance
recommends the use of brief interventions in routine
clinical contacts and this forms part of a wider Making
Every Contact Count approach which is now embedded
within National Health Service (NHS) delivery in the
UK.12 13
Physiotherapists are well placed to promote PA.
There are over 51 000 physiotherapists registered in
the UK working across health and social care, often
supporting people with long-term conditions.14 In
2015–2016, there were over 5 million physiotherapy
outpatient contacts15; a large proportion of patients
accessing outpatient physiotherapy services are either
overweight or obese, have multiple comorbid health
conditions and are physically inactive.16
Little is known about the extent to which PA promo-
tion is currently integrated into physiotherapy practice.
Several international studies suggest that levels of PA
promotion in physiotherapy practice are low.17–21 One
study from Ireland presented more positive findings22
and we identified no studies that explore the extent of
PA promtion in a UK setting in a 2016 scoping
review.23
Delivering brief interventions for PA requires health-
care professionals to have knowledge of PA guidelines.
Specifically, healthcare professionals must ascertain
whether a patient is in a risk category and know how to
make evidence-based recommendations. The first UK-
wide PA guidelines were published in 20115; these
were updated and formatted into an infographic in
2015.24
Previous studies suggest PA guidelines are insuffi-
ciently taught in undergraduate medical curricula and
there is lack of knowledge of them among final year
medical students.25–27 A survey of physiotherapists in
Ireland reported that only 51% of participants were
able to accurately state the current PA guidelines.17 No
studies have been identified that explore knowledge of
PA guidelines among UK physiotherapists.
A healthy and productive NHS workforce is critical to
the sustainability of the NHS and PA is an important
means of improving workforce health.28 NHS organisa-
tions are encouraged to support employees to be more
physically active29 30 yet little is known about the PA
habits of the physiotherapy workforce. In addition, PA
habits are a consistent and independent correlate of
PA promotion in other healthcare professions.31 There
is preliminary evidence that this relationship also
extends to physiotherapists,18 21 32 but this has not
been explored in the UK.
Hence, the aim of this study was to explore PA
promotion in routine physiotherapy practice in the
UK. Specific objectives were to:
1. Understand
the
frequency
with
which
physiotherapists:
i. initiate conversations about PA;
ii. formally assess PA status;
iii. deliver brief interventions for PA;
iv. signpost patients to other PA services.
2. Assess
physiotherapists’
knowledge
of
the
PA
guidelines.
3. Measure the PA habits of physiotherapists and eval-
uate whether this is associated with PA promotion in
clinical practice.
METHODS
Ethics
Ethical approval was granted from the Health & Well-
being Faculty Ethics Committee at Sheffield Hallam
University
(reference
2015–16/HWB-HSC-21).
The
approval was for a broader survey of allied health
professionals’ engagement with public health practice.
The specific PA questions were included with prior
consent of all parties with the intention of separate
analysis and publication.
Design
A cross-sectional survey was undertaken.
Survey tool
A survey tool was developed using Survey Monkey soft-
ware. Following a pilot (48 physiotherapists), a small
number of minor changes were made to the wording of
questions. All questions were closed with finite answer
options; this was agreed in view of the anticipated
volume of responses (survey questions can be seen in
online supplementary file 1). The questions were
designed specifically for this survey with the exception
of measurement of clinicians’ PA habits; a validated,
single-item question was used to gather this informa-
tion.33 The full survey was approved by representatives
from Public Health England and the Chartered Society
of Physiotherapy.
Procedure
The survey was live in May 2016 and was available for
3 weeks; this was determined by the need to avoid
periods
of
political
sensitivity.
The
survey
was
promoted widely on social media and through the
Chartered
Society
of
Physiotherapy’s
member
networks. To meet the eligibility criteria, respondents

 were asked to confirm that they were physiotherapists
in the UK and had current patient contact.
Analysis
All returned surveys were included in the analysis
regardless of missing data; consequently, the number
of total responses for each survey item is varied. A deci-
sion was made to include the pilot data in analysis as
only minor changes had been made to the survey
following the pilot. All responses were exported into
IBM SPSS V.24 and analysed using descriptive statis-
tics. Associations between variables were assessed using
c2 test.
Reporting is in line with the STROBE (STrength-
ening
the
Reporting
of
OBservational
studies
in
Epidemiology) statement for cross-sectional
studies
(Supplementary file 3).34
FINDINGS
Participant characteristics
There were 522 responses to the survey; the physio-
therapy population is estimated to be 51 000,14 the
sample is therefore approximately 1% of the estimated
population.
Eighty-nine per cent (n=463) of the sample were
qualified physiotherapists, 10% (n=51) were student
physiotherapists
and
1.5%
(n=8)
were
support
workers. Ninety-three per cent were from England and
all four nations were represented (Scotland 3%, Wales
3% and Northern Ireland 1%).
Respondents reported a range of years of experience
(see figure 1). The majority of respondents worked in
the NHS (92%) and respondents worked across a range
of settings (see figure 2).
Only findings from qualified physiotherapists and
student physiotherapists are reported hereafter, they
are reported together as ‘physiotherapists’ in line with
the aims of the study. Full results are available in
online supplementary file 2.
Current practice
Participants were asked to estimate the frequency with
which they carried out a number of specific actions
related to PA promotion in predefined categories in
line with previous similar cross-sectional surveys.22 The
questions were worded such that it was clear that the
question related to situations in which there was a clear
indication to promote PA. Findings are presented in
table 1.
Knowledge of PA guidelines
Eighty-eight per cent of respondents (n=382) reported
that they were aware of the existence of PA guidelines.
Knowledge of three specific aspects of the recommen-
dations is detailed in table 2. Only 16% (n=83) of
respondents answered all three questions correctly.

 PA habits of physiotherapists
The median number of sufficiently active days (ie, days
on which respondents achieved at least 30 min of
moderate PA)33 was 4. The proportion of respondents
who
achieved
the
recommended
5�30 min
of
moderate intensity PA over a week was 38% (n=149).
The frequency with which respondents delivered
brief interventions was not associated with years of
experience (c2 p=0.429) nor was it associated with
physiotherapists’ own PA habits (c2 p=0.078).
DISCUSSION
The vast majority of respondents integrated some form
of discussion about PA with their patients. However,
levels of PA are not routinely assessed and brief inter-
ventions are not routinely delivered. Knowledge of all
three elements of the PA guidelines is poor, and there-
fore when brief interventions are delivered they may
not be based on the best available evidence. The
majority of respondents do not themselves do sufficient
PA to confer optimal health benefits although this was
not associated with the likelihood of them promoting
PA in practice.
How does this fit with previous research?
There is no existing evidence on the extent to which
PA promotion is integrated into physiotherapy practice
in the UK. As physiotherapists in other countries
provide even lower levels of PA promotion,17–21 our
findings may reflect the growing awareness of PA as a
major public health issue in the UK over time.
We find it encouraging that 68% of respondents
report routinely delivering brief interventions for PA.
This does, however, raise questions about why the
other 32% do not. Barriers to delivering brief interven-
tions for PA in a UK physiotherapy context have not
been explored; related literature suggests that barriers
may include (1) lack of time, (2) lack of belief in the
effectiveness of brief interventions, (3) perceived lack
of knowledge, and (4) a sense that it is not acceptable
to patients.21 22 35 36
Only
40%
of
respondents
reported
that
they
routinely used some form of measurement tool to
assess patients’ levels of PA and thus identify inactive
patients, in line with earlier findings.17 Conversely,
O’Donoghue et al found that 76% of physiotherapists
always assessed PA levels.22 The discrepancy between
these studies may relate to the definition of ‘assess-
ment’; this term could be interpreted as use of either a
formal or informal approach to assessment.
Formal assessment would involve use of a measure-
ment tool; current clinical guidance recommends the
use of the General Practice Physical Activity Question-
naire to assess PA levels in routine practice.37
38
However, such measures take time to complete and
interpret and therefore may not be practical in a busy
clinical setting.
The alternative is to use informal approaches which,
although quicker, are likely to be insufficient to accu-
rately measure PA levels and inadequate as a baseline
from which to measure change. Some may argue that
formal assessment is unnecessary and beyond the scope
of routine practice; however, delivering brief interven-
tions
indiscriminately
regardless
of
risk
has
cost
implications for services that could be avoided with a
more targeted approach.39
As many as 56% of respondents did not routinely
direct patients to further sources of support for PA,
even when there was a clear indication to do so. In
other areas of health promotion, uptake of further
support has been shown to be enhanced when onward
referral is facilitated by the system following a brief
intervention,
for
example,
by
making
a
forward
referral at that time, rather than leaving it to patients
to initiate further action themselves.40 41
Despite 88% of respondents being aware of the
current Chief Medical Officers’ PA guidelines, only
16% answered the three specific questions correctly.
This extends evidence from other professions which
highlighted a lack of curriculum content and a lack of
knowledge among students.25–27 It adds weight to the
recent assertion by Reid et al that that basic knowledge
of the PA guidelines, and their components, remains
consistently low across health professionals.42

 Only 38% of respondents achieved the recommended
5�30 min of moderate PA. This finding must be inter-
preted with caution due to the limitations inherent with
any single-item, self-report measure.43 44 The measure
used in this study excludes the incidental PA that occurs
through occupation or housework for example. It there-
fore does not reflect the most recent iteration of the PA
guidelines which promote the accumulation of 150 min
moderate PA in bouts of 10 min or more through any
means.5 In contrast to findings from other studies, phys-
iotherapists’ own PA levels were not associated with their
PA promotion activity in our study.18 21 32
Suggestions for enhancing clinical practice
Knowledge of all three elements of the PA guidelines is
limited, and this raises questions about the content,

 quality and specificity of the brief interventions that are
delivered in clinical practice. Additionally, assessment of
PA status and signposting could be considered to be
integral components of a brief intervention, yet these
were delivered far less frequently. In practice, despite
the number of PA measurement tools available, it is
difficult to identify a tool that is sufficiently rigorous yet
retains
clinical
utility
in
a
physiotherapy
setting.
Consensus on the level of assessment of PA status that is
appropriate and feasible may help improve the consis-
tency of practice
in this area. It may require a
physiotherapy-led consensus statement on PA brief
interventions to resonate more fully with the physio-
therapy community than one led by physicians or public
health experts.
The expectation that physiotherapists will signpost
patients to further sources of PA support requires more
investigation and mechanisms that could facilitate the
sharing of PA information across sectors need to be
explored.
Physiotherapists’ understanding of brief interven-
tions warrants further exploration as do the barriers
to delivering them in the context of UK physio-
therapy
practice.
In
addition,
further
work
is
required to explore why the guideline specifics of
training
intensity
and
strength
training
are
not
reaching frontline clinicians. Effective dissemination
of this information is required across the future and
current physiotherapy workforce.
The majority of respondents to this survey were insuf-
ficiently active to gain optimum health benefits. The PA
levels of the NHS workforce are an important consider-
ation as part of a broader workforce well-being agenda.
Thus, further investigation of the PA levels of the phys-
iotherapy
workforce
using
more
robust,
direct
measurement techniques is warranted.
Strengths and limitations
This is the first cross-sectional survey that explores
current practice in relation to PA promotion in physio-
therapy practice, knowledge of PA guidelines and PA
habits of physiotherapists. It has generated a prelimi-
nary picture that can inform practice developments
and future research.
The UK PA guidelines contain several important
messages and not all of these were tested. There are
also specific PA guidelines for early years, children and
older adults; only the adult guidelines were considered
in this study.
The non-probability (self-selected) sampling strategy
means that care must be taken when interpreting find-
ings. The survey may have been subject to self-
selection
bias,
with
engaged
physiotherapists
responding more readily than those who do not have
an interest in this area. This could have led to an over-
representation of the extent to which PA is currently
promoted for example. However, in addition to budget
constraints, it would be challenging to obtain a national
random sample of UK physiotherapists due to a lack of
availability of essential demographic data, and thus an
inability to define the population.
CONCLUSION
We identified positive findings in that most respondents
integrate discussions about PA into most of their patient
contacts. Further investigation is needed relating to the
lack of formal assessment of PA status, relatively poor
knowledge of the PA guidelines and a lack of consistent
signposting to further PA support. Physiotherapists are
ideally placed to contribute to the global efforts to
reduce PI. However,support is required to ensure that
effective and feasible PA interventions are integrated
into routine care in order to maximise potential
impact. To improve the reach of our study we have
created a summary infographic (figure 3).
