ABSTRACT
Objective Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a
chronic cholestatic liver disease often leading to end-
stage liver disease. Its pathogenesis remains largely
unknown, although frequent concomitant IBD hints
towards common factors underlying gut and bile duct
inflammation. Considering the mounting evidence on the
involvement of the intestinal microbiota in initiating and
determining IBD phenotype, we investigated intestinal
microbiota composition in patients with PSC.
Design Stool samples were collected from 147
individuals (52 patients with PSC, 52 age, gender and
body mass index-matched healthy volunteers, 13 UC and
30 patients with Crohn’s disease). An independent
validation cohort of 14 PSC and 14 matched controls
was recruited. 16S rDNA sequencing of faecal DNA was
performed (Illumina MiSeq).
Results The microbiota of patients with PSC was
characterised by decreased microbiota diversity, and a
significant overrepresentation of Enterococcus (p=3.76e-
05), Fusobacterium (p=3.76e-05) and Lactobacillus
(p=0.0002) genera. This dysbiosis was present in
patients with PSC with and without concomitant IBD
and was distinct from IBD, and independent of
treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid. A decision tree
based on abundances of these three genera allowed
reliable classification in the validation cohort. In
particular, one operational taxonomic unit belonging to
the Enterococcus genus was associated with increased
levels of serum alkaline phosphatase (p=0.048), a
marker of disease severity.
Conclusions We here present the first report of
PSC-associated faecal dysbiosis, independent from IBD
signatures, suggesting the intestinal microbiota could be
a contributing factor in PSC pathogenesis. Further
studies are needed to confirm these findings and assess
causality.
INTRODUCTION
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic
cholestatic liver disease characterised by the devel-
opment of multifocal bile duct strictures that can
lead to liver fibrosis and subsequent cirrhosis.1 PSC
has an incidence of 1.3 per 100 000 individuals.
There is no effective medical treatment for this
condition and liver transplantation is offered to
patients with PSC with end-stage liver disease,
although PSC recurrence occurs in up to 23% of
patients after liver transplantation.2
The pathogenesis of PSC remains poorly under-
stood,
with
current
evidence
suggesting
that
genetic, immunologic and environmental factors all
play a role. Between 60% and 80% of patients with
PSC have concomitant IBD, most frequently ulcera-
tive colitis (UC), suggesting that inflammation in
the colon is of importance in disease presentation.
The intestinal microbiota has also been suggested
to play a role in PSC pathogenesis, as translocated
bacterial products are more frequently found in
explant livers from patients with PSC when com-
pared with patients with other liver disorders.3
Metronidazole
therapy,
which
alters
bacterial
microbiota composition, transiently improves liver
function tests without however altering transplant
free survival.4 Furthermore, colectomy performed
before liver transplantation decreases PSC relapse
rate after liver transplantation, indicating that the
Significance of this study
What is already known on this subject?
▸ Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a cholestatic
liver disease strongly associated with IBD.
▸ Intestinal microbiota play an important role in
the pathogenesis of IBD.
▸ Antibiotic therapy in patients with primary
sclerosing cholangitis transiently improves liver
function tests without however altering
transplant free survival.
What are the new findings?
▸ Primary sclerosing cholangitis is associated
with alterations in intestinal microbiota,
independently of comorbidity with IBD.
▸ Three genera Enterococcus, Lactobacillus and
Fusobacterium are overrepresented in patients
with primary sclerosing cholangitis.
▸ An operational taxonomic unit belonging to the
Enterococcus genus is positively correlated with
the levels of alkaline phosphatase.
How might it impact on clinical practice in
the foreseeable future?
▸ Intestinal microbiota modulation through diet,
faecal microbiota transplantation, antibiotics or
probiotics may be used in the treatment or
prevention of primary sclerosing cholangitis.

 colon is instrumental in the initiation of inflammation in the
liver.2 Moreover, a new antigen-dependent mouse model con-
firmed that immune-mediated cholangitis is caused by T cells
primed in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue which further sup-
ports the hypothesis that cholangitis is gut triggered and immune
mediated.5 More recently, a Mdr2(−/−) mouse model of PSC
was developed, leading to a more severe phenotype of PSC when
raised in germ-free conditions, further suggesting a role of the
intestinal microbiota in the development of bile duct injury.6
The role of the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of
IBD is well recognised. Bacteria influence intestinal inflamma-
tion through the interplay with the immune system, such as the
induction of CD25+ regulatory T cells, downregulation of
proinflammatory and upregulation of anti-inflammatory cyto-
kines.7 Dysbiosis, the deviation from the normal composition of
the human intestinal microbiota, has already been described in
IBD. Crohn’s disease (CD) dysbiosis is mainly characterised by
reduced microbial richness,7 a decrease in Faecalibacterium
prausnitzii,8 Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Dialister invisus and
uncharacterised species of Clostridium cluster XIVa and an
increase in the mucus-degrading Ruminococcus gnavus.9 On the
other hand, patients with UC display normal intestinal microbial
richness10 and UC dysbiosis is characterised by a reduction in
Roseburia hominis and F
. prausnitzii, both producers of butyr-
ate, a short-chain fatty acid with known anti-inflammatory
properties.7 11
Considering the already described IBD-associated dysbiosis
and the frequent concomitant development of IBD with PSC,
we hypothesised that the intestinal microbiota might be altered
in patients with PSC. W
e analysed the composition of the micro-
biota in a well-characterised cohort of patients with PSC and
compared them to healthy controls and patients with IBD.
METHODS
Patients
Patients with PSC, IBD and PSC with concomitant IBD were
included. All patients were recruited at the IBD or liver out-
patient clinic of the University Hospitals of Leuven (Belgium).
PSC diagnosis followed established guidelines and was based
on symptoms and/or signs of chronic cholestatic liver injury,
negative anti-mitochondrial autoantibodies and HIV serology,
imaging compatible with bile duct injury (magnetic resonance
cholangiopancreatography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopan-
creatography) and/or liver biopsy with typical findings in the
absence of drug use associated with cholestatic liver injury.12
The diagnosis of liver cirrhosis was established on biopsy or by
imaging with MRI or elastography in conjugation with labora-
tory and clinical findings supporting the diagnosis of cirrhosis
(see online supplementary table S1).
Diagnosis of CD or UC was confirmed by a combination of
endoscopy, histopathology and radiological and biochemical
investigations, according to existing guidelines.13 14
Healthy controls were selected from the Flemish Gut Flora
Project (FGFP) currently including over 3000 sampled volun-
teers, to match patients with PSC for age, gender and body
mass index (BMI).
All patients and healthy controls signed informed consent
before sample collection. The local ethical committee approved
the study (reference number: S53684 and S58125).
Clinical data
Basic demographic data, clinical data and information about
possible confounders of microbiota analysis (eg, specific diet,
prebiotic and probiotic use, antibiotic treatment in the last
30 days) were collected at the time of inclusion for all patients.
Also, complementary clinical information was extracted from
the clinical files of the patients. Harvey–Bradshaw index (HBI)
and partial Mayo score were collected from patients with CD
and
UC,
respectively.

characteristics.
Clinical information from the healthy controls was extracted
from the FGFP database, which contains a medical report from
the general practitioner and self-reported information about
possible confounders for intestinal microbiota analysis (eg, pre-
biotic and probiotic use).
Samples and DNA extraction
Fresh faecal samples from patients were collected at the out-
patient clinic of the University Hospitals of Leuven and frozen
at −80°C within 12 h after sampling. Blood samples were taken
during the same clinic visit.
The faecal samples of the healthy controls were collected by
the volunteers and immediately frozen at −20°C in their home
freezers. They were transported frozen within a week to the
laboratory and stored at −80°C.
Faecal calprotectin measurements were performed for all
patients with the fCAL ELISA kit (Bühlmann, Schönenbuch,
Switzerland). Faecal calprotectin was not quantified in healthy
controls and in patients with UC because samples were frozen
on collection, which may result in overestimation, as stated by
the manufacturer.
Bacterial DNA extraction from faecal samples was performed
with the MOBIO PowerMicrobiome RNA isolation kit (MO
BIO Laboratories, Carlsbad, California, USA), using an adapted
protocol. In short, after mechanical and chemical lysis in Glass
Bead T
ubes, samples were incubated at 90°C for 10 min.
Afterwards, normal protocol was followed with the exclusion of
the DNase I step at the end.
Quantification of bacterial DNA for PCR was done with a

fluorometer
(Life

Island,

quantification of the libraries was performed with Fragment
Analyzer (Advanced Analytical T
echnologies, Ames, Iowa, USA).
Sequencing 16S rRNA gene
The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified with
primer pairs 515F and 806R, with single multiplex identifier
and adaptors as described by Kozich et al.15 Sequencing was
performed

Combined reads quality threshold was set at minimum 30
quality score over 90% of read length (Fastx tool kit; http://

filtered out (UCHIME17).
Microbiota analysis
Each sample was downsized to 10 000 reads by random selec-
tion of quality-checked reads. Genus and phylum abundance
matrices were obtained by mapping to the Ribosomal Database
Project (RDP) reference database (RDP classifier18). The oper-
ational taxonomic unit (OTU)-level abundance matrix was
obtained by de novo clustering of reads at 97% identity, corre-
sponding to species-level clustering (USEARCH19). For specific
OTU taxonomic assignment, we performed a megaBLAST
search of the OTU centroid read against NCBI 16S rDNA

tion of different oligotypes in the genera of interest.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed in R (V
.3.1.3), using the phy-
loseq21 and vegan( J Oksanen, FG Blanchet, R Kindt, et al.
vegan: Community Ecology Package. R package version 2.3–0,

with the Shapiro–Wilk test. Non-parametric test were applied to
analyse microbiome data, with multiple testing correction when-
ever applicable (adjustment for false discovery rate (FDR)).
Adjusted p values <0.05 were considered significant.
Mann–Whitney U (Kruskal–W
allis for more than two groups)
was used to test median differences in α-diversity (microbiota
species richness) and genera abundances between different
groups. Correlation between genera abundances and continuous
metadata was performed with Spearman correlation. Principal
coordinates analysis (PCoA) on OTU-level community compos-
ition (metric: Bray–Curtis dissimilarity) was used to visualise
microbiota variation across samples and significance of commu-
nity differences between groups of patients were tested with
Adonis non-parametric test.

acy of prediction was evaluated by the area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC) on the test set (validation
cohort).
RESULTS
Demographic data
Cohort 1 included 52 patients with PSC (see online supplemen-
tary figure S1): 13 had PSC without IBD (hereafter referred to as
PSC only). As control groups, 52 age, gender and BMI-matched
healthy controls were selected from the FGFP database and 43
additional patients with IBD without PSC were recruited.
A validation cohort of 14 patients with PSC (of whom 9 with
concomitant IBD) was recruited as an independent test set.
Additionally, 14 age, gender and BMI-matched healthy controls
were selected from the FGFP database for the independent test
set. These subjects were recruited and sampled after the initial
analysis and faecal DNA was extracted and sequenced in an
independent run. Patient characteristics from both cohorts are
summarised in table 1.
The majority of patients with IBD were in remission, as evi-
denced by low clinical activity scores (HBI and partial Mayo
score) and normal C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.
Faecal dysbiosis in patients with PSC includes decreased
species richness and altered community composition,
regardless of concomitant IBD and UDCA treatment
The overall faecal microbiota composition of patients (PSC, CD
or UC) was significantly different from that of healthy controls,
as evidenced by their separation along the first axis of the PCoA
(on OTU-level abundance matrix with the Bray–Curtis dissimi-
larity; figure 1A; Adonis R2=0.1, p value=0.00099). Focusing
on the patients with PSC, samples from the different subgroups
(PSC only, PSC-UC and PSC-CD) were not significantly different
from one another, such that they cluster together on the PCoA
(Adonis p values>0.05; see online supplementary table S2).
However, they did cluster apart from patients with CD and UC
(Adonis R2=0.0932, p value=0.001; figure 1A). Of note, the
microbiota of patients with PSC under ursodeoxycholic acid
(UDCA) treatment was not significantly different from patients
with PSC without UDCA treatment (see online supplementary
table S2). Also, the microbiota of patients with PSC treated who
underwent antibiotic treatment in the past month was not sig-
nificantly different from that of patients with PSC with no anti-
biotic treatment.

(FDR-adjusted

with UC compared with healthy controls.
Three genera, including Enterococcus, are increased in
patients with PSC regardless of concomitant IBD and UDCA
treatment
Both at phylum-level (figure 2A) and genus-level (figure 2B)
composition, significant differences were observed between PSC
and healthy controls. At the phylum level, Bacteroidetes were
more abundant in patients with PSC, whereas Firmicutes were
underrepresented
(FDR-adjusted
p
value=2.097e-03
and
1.636e-06, respectively). Healthy controls had lower abundance
of
Fusobacteria
than
patients
with
PSC
(FDR-adjusted

At the genus level, when compared with healthy controls,
patients with PSC only displayed increased abundance of
Enterococcus, Fusobacterium, Lactobacillus, Morganella and
Streptococcus
and
decreased
abundance
of
Anaerostipes
(FDR-adjusted p values=3.76e-05, 3.76e-05, 0.0002, 0.007,

for

when

with
healthy controls (see online supplementary Table S3). There
were four genera significantly altered in all the PSC subgroups
as
compared
with
healthy
controls—Enterococcus,
Streptococcus, Lactobacillus and Fusobacterium, all but the
latter exclusively associated with PSC dysbiosis, and not with
UC nor CD dysbiosis (figure 3B). The three bacterial genera
remained significantly different between PSC and healthy con-
trols after excluding patients taking UDCA. Most of these
changes remained significant after excluding patients with cir-
rhosis or liver transplantation from the analysis (see online sup-
plementary table S4). After excluding patients with antibiotic
use, Streptococcus was no longer significantly different between
patients with PSC only and healthy controls.

(without concomitant PSC) or antibiotic treatment, the micro-

these genera are specifically overrepresented in all subgroups of

biotic treatment, probiotics, treatment with UDCA, liver cirrho-
sis and liver transplantation). W

 independently recruited, sampled and sequenced, yielded a
correct classification of 71% of the subjects with an acceptable
discrimination (AUC=0.724).
The microbiota signature of PSC is conserved across PSC
severity groups, even after controlling for clinical
confounders
W
e then assessed associations between the abundances of genera
included in the PSC signature described above and disease sever-
ity, both for PSC and IBD. For this purpose, patients with PSC
were divided according to disease severity into stable patients,
patients with cirrhosis and patients having undergone liver
transplantation. Patients with IBD were divided into patients in
clinical remission (HBI<4 for CD and partial Mayo<3 for UC),
patients with active disease and patients with total colectomy
and ileoanal pouch.
W
e first tested for genera significantly associated with PSC
disease severity, while removing the influence of possible con-
founders, by performing a multivariate analysis (MaAsLin). Sex,
age, BMI, smoking status, antibiotic use and UDCA treatment
were used as potential clinical confounders. Besides confirming
previously
reported
associations
such
as
the
increase
in
Methanobrevibacter abundance with age, we confirmed that the
genera Fusobacterium, Enterococcus and Lactobacillus were sig-
nificantly decreased in healthy controls compared with all
patients with PSC, regardless of disease severity, even when
deconfounding for the six other variables (p value <0.001; see
online supplementary table S5).
Enterococcus abundance correlates to alkaline phosphatase
levels, but this is not confirmed by multivariate analysis
Interestingly, the alterations in the signature genera abundances
were more pronounced in patients with cirrhosis and liver trans-
plantation in comparison with patients having stable disease (see
online supplementary figure S3A), although these lacked statis-
tical significance, probably due to the reduced sample size after
splitting the groups. The same findings were observed in
patients with IBD, where the differences at the genus level were
more pronounced in patients with active disease or patients
with an ileoanal pouch than in patients in clinical remission (see
online supplementary figure S3b). Again, these differences were
not significant after correction for multiple testing.

 Since disease severity groups provided hints of a possible
association between severity and the amplitude of the micro-
biota signature, we next evaluated the correlation between the
three PSC-associated genera and serum γ-glutamyl transpepti-
dase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), two clinical
markers of cholestasis. In fact, a persistent elevation of ALP
often triggers the diagnosis of PSC. A significant positive spear-
man
correlation
was
found
between
the
abundance
of
Enterococcus, and Lactobacillus and GGT (see online supple-
mentary table S6). Notably, we found a positive correlation
(Spearman ρ=0.29, adjusted p value=0.012199; figure 4)
between Enterococcus abundance and ALP
, although this correl-
ation did not withstand multivariate analysis deconfounding for
sex, age, BMI, smoking status and antibiotic use (adjusted
p value=0.6).
W
e also examined the genus Enterococcus at OTU (roughly
comparable to species) level. There were three OTUs assigned
to the genus Enterococcus, one of which (OTU1) was signifi-
cantly different in all subgroups of patients with PSC compared
with healthy controls, while showing no significant difference
between patients with IBD (without PSC) and healthy controls.
Furthermore, the association between OTU1 and PSC diagnosis
is significant regardless of disease severity (stable, cirrhosis and
liver transplantation), even when deconfounding for sex, age,
faecal calprotectin, BMI, smoking, UDCA use, serum ALP
levels, antibiotic use and liver transplantation. Comparably to
the genus-level analysis, OTU1 was also positively correlated
with GGT
, ALP and ALT (Spearman ρ=0.321, 0.258, 0.296,
adjusted p value=0.001, 0.048, 0.002, respectively), but could
not be confirmed in multivariate analysis. The centroid read of

 OTU1 had equally high similarity, but below perfect, matches to
the species Enterococcus hirae, E. faecium and E. faecalis (see
online supplementary table S7). The other two OTUs (OTU2
and OTU3) did not have much impact in the overall results.
The three genera were also decomposed by oligotyping ana-
lysis to determine whether a specific oligotype associated with
PSC
severity.
The
Enterococcus,
Fusobacterium
and
Lactobacillus genus decomposed in 2, 3 and 13 olygotypes,
respectively. One oligotype (OLIG2; see online supplementary
figure S4) from the Enterococcus genus was positively correlated
with
serum
ALP
levels
(Spearman
ρ=0.34,
adjusted
p
value=0.0452). The other oligotype also correlated positively
with ALP serum level, but did not resist multiple testing correc-
tion (Spearman r=0.32, non-adjusted p value=0.0332).
DISCUSSION
In the present study, we analysed the faecal microbiota asso-
ciated with PSC. Because patients with PSC frequently develop
concomitant IBD, we assembled a large cohort of patients with
PSC, and compared their microbiota with two control groups,
one being patients with IBD without PSC and the other age,
gender and BMI-matched healthy volunteers. To confirm our
findings, a second smaller validation cohort of patients with
PSC and healthy controls was independently recruited, sampled
and sequenced. W
e show that the faecal microbiota in patients
with PSC is significantly different from that of healthy volun-
teers and patients with IBD. Furthermore, samples from patients
with both PSC and concomitant IBD clustered together with
PSC only and apart from patients with IBD without PSC.
Therefore, PSC seems to shape the microbiota composition
stronger than IBD, allowing for a clear separation of samples of
patients with PSC according to PSC diagnosis and regardless of
concomitant IBD.
PSC
dysbiosis
was
characterised
by
reduced
microbiota
diversity. W
e also found a consistent signature of four genera—
Enterococcus, Fusobacterium, Lactobacillus and Streptococcus—
which were overrepresented in all subgroups of PSC (PSC only,
PSC-UC and PSC-CD) compared with healthy controls. After
taking into account antibiotic use, Streptococcus was no longer
significantly overrepresented in patients with PSC. The same
three genera (Enterococcus, Fusobacterium and Lactobacillus)
signature was found when restricting to patients without liver
cirrhosis, liver transplantation or associated IBD. W
e confirmed
this signature with multivariate analysis, correcting for possible
clinical confounders. This signature allowed discrimination of
patients with PSC from healthy controls in the validation cohort
with 71% accuracy.
Interestingly, the three genera forming the PSC signature have
already been associated with other diseases. Enterococcus and
Lactobacillus have been associated with dysbiosis in liver cirrho-
sis24 25 and IBD.26 These genera represent lactic acid-producing
bacteria, with the former encoding a wide range of both intrin-
sic and acquired resistance to antibiotics.27 Fusobacterium has
also been previously associated with liver cirrhosis,24 IBD26 28
and colorectal cancer.29
It is worth mentioning that a recent study analysed the
mucosa-associated microbiota of patients with PSC sampled
during colonoscopy and found one sole association to PSC, the
underrepresentation
of
an
uncultured
Clostridiales
II.30
Expectedly, our results differ, because the transient (faecal)
microbiota differs from the adherent (mucosal) microbiota,26
and because our cohort includes patients with PSC without con-
comitant IBD and the higher sample size (N=147 vs N=32)
allows for higher discovery potential.
Elevated ALP serum levels are used in PSC diagnosis,12 as
well as in follow-up of the disease, as elevated levels reveal cho-
lestasis. Growing evidence suggests that reduced levels of ALP
are associated with an improved prognosis in PSC.31 32 In our
cohort, the genus Enterococcus positively correlated with ALP
in univariate analysis, suggesting a potential link between these
bacteria and disease severity. This was further illustrated by the
detection of species from the genus Enterococcus associated
with disease severity, using two different approaches to increase
resolution (OTU clustering and oligotyping), although this trend
will have to be confirmed in a bigger cohort. Higher ALP serum
levels in patients with PSC are associated with more pronounced
cholestasis due to increasing severity in biliary strictures. Bile
colonisation by enteric bacteria such as Enterococcus spp is
more common among patients with PSC with dominant stric-
tures.33 In the study of Pohl et al, E. faecalis and E. faecium
were the most frequently isolated species in bile in patients with
PSC with dominant strictures. In the present study, we observe
an overrepresentation of the genus Enterococcus in faecal
samples, accounting for up to 2% of the faecal bacteria in
patients with PSC. It is extremely unlikely that such a high rela-
tive abundance of Enterococcus result solely from colonised bile
being discharged in the intestinal tract. Our results therefore
suggest that Enterococcus population overgrowth in the intestine
occurs, independently of the colonisation of strictured bile
ducts, in patients with PSC.
In particular, OTU1 of the genus Enterococcus was solely
responsible for the genus-level positive correlation to disease
severity. The centroid sequence of this OTU matches with
equally high percentage identity several reference bacterial
species, including E. faecalis and E. faecium. Interestingly,
E. faecalis has already been associated with impaired intestinal
permeability.
Gelatinase,
a
metalloprotease
produced
by
E. faecalis, has been shown to alter the epithelial barrier, result-
ing in higher susceptibility to intestinal inflammation.34 The
impairment of the epithelial barrier might allow bacterial trans-
location and colonisation of the bile. Enterococcus is the most
frequently identified genus in bile culture studies, specifically
E. faecium.35
PSC frequently leads to cirrhosis, and in some cases end-stage
liver disease. Intestinal dysbiosis has already been described in
patients with liver cirrhosis, with an increase in Veillonella,
Streptococcus,
Prevotella,
Lactobacillus
and
Fusobacterium,
among others.24 E. faecalis has also been associated with liver
cirrhosis.25
In
accordance
with
the
literature,
the
genus
Enterococcus was overrepresented in patients with cirrhosis
from the first cohort when compared with healthy controls. The
genus Veillonella has recently been associated with PSC.36 W
e
also found Streptococcus and Veillonella to be increased in
patients with PSC with liver cirrhosis; however, the association
to PSC diagnosis was no longer significant when excluding
patients with liver cirrhosis from the analysis. At the genus level,
patients with PSC with more severe disease seem to have more
extreme deviations from healthy controls than patients with a
stable course of disease who tend to be more similar to healthy
controls. Nonetheless, no significant differences were observed
at the genus level between patients with stable disease and
patients with either liver cirrhosis or liver transplantation.
Furthermore, the increase in Enterococcus, Fusobacterium and
Lactobacillus was also found when comparing patients with
PSC without liver cirrhosis, liver transplantation or concomitant
IBD with healthy controls.
Currently, efficacious medical treatment for PSC is lacking.12
Notwithstanding, most patients with PSC are being treated with

 UDCA37 due to some evidence pointing towards possible clin-
ical benefits.31 As such, around 75% of the patients with PSC in
our cohort were taking UDCA. Faecal microbiota did not differ
between patients with PSC taking UDCA and those not taking
the medication. In addition, the three genera microbial signature
is also found in patients with PSC that are not taking UDCA.
Therefore, our results are not associated with treatment with
UDCA.
Intestinal microbiota may play a role in the pathogenesis of
IBD and dysbiosis has already been described both in CD and
UC.7 Interestingly, our results are in line with previously pub-
lished data by showing a decreased α-diversity in CD while no
difference was seen in UC, and a decrease of Faecalibacterium
in CD.7
8
10 The majority of patients with PSC also have
IBD, such that PSC is considered to be an extra-intestinal
manifestation of IBD.38 The pathogenesis of PSC has not yet
been elucidated; however, mounting evidence suggests that
intestinal microbiota might also play a role in its pathogenesis.
Genome-wide association studies have already identified 16
risk loci for PSC.39 Some of these risk loci such as FUT2
are associated with increased risk of bacterial and viral infec-
tions1
and
with
microbiome
composition.40
Furthermore,
germ-free Mdr2(−/−) mice have a more severe phenotype
of PSC.6
In conclusion, the faecal microbiota of patients with PSC
differs from that of healthy controls. A unique microbial signa-
ture of three genera was observed in patients with PSC, irre-
spective of the presence of IBD and UDCA treatment. A
positive correlation was found between the genus Enterococcus
and ALP serum levels. Our data support the hypothesis that the
intestinal microbiota plays an important role in the pathogenesis
of this chronic cholestatic liver disease.
