Abstract
Oncolytic viruses exploit the cancer cell phenotype to complete
their lytic life cycle, releasing progeny virus to infect nearby cells
and repeat the process. We modified the oncolytic group B aden-
ovirus EnAdenotucirev (EnAd) to express a bispecific single-chain
antibody, secreted from infected tumour cells into the microenvi-
ronment. This bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) binds to EpCAM on
target cells and cross-links them to CD3 on T cells, leading to clus-
tering and activation of both CD4 and CD8 T cells. BiTE transcrip-
tion can be controlled by the virus major late promoter, limiting
expression to cancer cells that are permissive for virus replication.
This approach can potentiate the cytotoxicity of EnAd, and we
demonstrate using primary pleural effusions and peritoneal malig-
nant ascites that infection of cancer cells with the BiTE-expressing
EnAd leads to activation of endogenous T cells to kill endogenous
tumour cells despite the immunosuppressive environment. In this
way, we have armed EnAd to combine both direct oncolysis and T
cell-mediated killing, yielding a potent therapeutic that should be
readily transferred into the clinic.

Introduction
Bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) are fusion proteins generated from
single-chain variable fragments (scFv) of two different monoclonal
antibodies, one normally a CD3 agonist and the other recognising a
surface antigen on target cells, linked by a short flexible peptide
linker (Baeuerle & Reinhardt, 2009). By simultaneously engaging
CD3 and the target cell antigen, BiTEs mediate T-cell activation and
lysis of target cells (Wolf et al, 2005). Importantly, BiTE-mediated
cytotoxicity can occur without any co-stimulatory signals or ex vivo
prestimulation (Dreier et al, 2002) and independent of peptide-
antigen presentation on MHC molecules.
T-cell activation is a result of CD3 clustering on T cells, induced
by multiple BiTE molecules simultaneously cross-linking CD3 on T
cells and the target cell antigen (Offner et al, 2006; Brischwein et al,
2007), and leads to increased expression of T-cell activation markers
CD69 and CD25, granzyme B, perforin, adhesion molecules and
various cytokines such as IFNc and TNFa. As BiTE-mediated
tumour cell killing is not MHC restricted, they provide the
opportunity to target T-cell cytotoxicity to tumour cells, independent
of antigen recognition and MHC class I levels on the tumour cells.
Blinatumomab, a BiTE targeting CD3 and CD19, is currently the
clinically most advanced BiTE (Brischwein et al, 2006) and recently
gained FDA approval due to its promising clinical performance
(Przepiorka et al, 2015). Major responses have been demonstrated
in various B-cell malignancies (Bargou et al, 2008; Topp et al,
2011), and BiTEs have been designed targeting different tumour-
associated antigens including EpCAM, Her2/neu, EGFR, CEA,
EphA2, CD33 and MCSP with some currently under clinical evalua-
tion (Baeuerle & Reinhardt, 2009; Yuraszeck et al, 2017).
Oncolytic viruses depend on features of the tumour phenotype to
enable productive virus replication, thereby undergoing their lytic
life cycle selectively in cancer cells before spreading to infect adja-
cent cells and repeat the process. Such viruses can also be “armed”
to express therapeutic transgenes, and secrete them from infected
tumour cells (Seymour & Fisher, 2016). The first agent to receive an
FDA product licence, Imlygic, is an oncolytic herpes virus that
expresses human GM-CSF (Grigg et al, 2016). Several oncolytic
viruses are currently under development, but one of the most
advanced is EnAdenotucirev (EnAd), a chimera of adenovirus type
3 (Ad3) and type 11p (Ad11p), which is currently undergoing clini-
cal evaluation for a range of metastatic carcinoma types (Kuhn et al,
2008; Calvo et al, 2014; Illingworth et al, 2017).
Here, we assessed whether EnAd could be engineered to express
and secrete a BiTE from infected cancer cells that would activate

 T cells to bind and kill EpCAM-positive target cells. This approach
has the advantage of expanding the cytotoxic effects of the virus to
kill nearby EpCAM-positive cells, increasing the anticancer potency
of the treatment by engaging targeted T-cell cytotoxicity indepen-
dent of MHCI/TCR engagement. We explored the use of different
promoters to regulate BiTE expression and assessed antigen speci-
ficity, showing that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells can be activated to
mediate cytotoxicity. We also made use of primary human samples
of malignant peritoneal ascites and malignant pleural exudates and
show that EnAd expressing the EpCAM BiTE can overcome
immune-suppressive effects associated with the tumour microenvi-
ronment and can activate endogenous T cells to kill endogenous
tumour cells. These data make a strong case supporting clinical
development of EnAd expressing BiTEs, as a strategy to mediate
tumour-targeted
oncolysis
combined
with
tumour-targeted
immunotherapy, providing a new level of therapeutic strategy for
treatment of disseminated cancer.
Results
Generation and production of a BiTE targeting EpCAM
A BiTE targeting EpCAM was engineered by joining two scFv speci-
fic for CD3e and EpCAM with a flexible glycine-serine (GS) linker. A
control BiTE, recognising CD3e and an irrelevant antigen (the fila-
mentous hemagglutinin adhesin (FHA) of Bordetella pertussis), was
also produced. Both BiTEs were engineered to contain an N-terminal
signal
sequence
for
mammalian
secretion
and
a
C-terminal
decahistidine affinity tag for detection and purification (Fig 1A). To
characterise the functionality of the recombinant BiTEs, they were
cloned into expression vectors under transcriptional control of the
CMV immediate early promoter (pSF-CMV-EpCAMBiTE and pSF-
CMV-ControlBiTE, respectively). Adherent HEK293 cells (HEK293A)
were transfected with the expression vectors and supernatants
harvested and concentrated 50-fold for further analysis. To estimate
the amount of BiTE produced, samples were serially diluted and
evaluated, using anti-His, in a dot blot using decahistidine-tagged
cathepsin D as a standard. In this way, it was possible to estimate
the level of BiTEs produced into the supernatant to be approxi-
mately 20 lg/ml at 48 h post-transfection (of 1.8e7 HEK293A cells)
(Fig EV1A). Specific binding of the EpCAM BiTE and not the control
BiTE to recombinant EpCAM protein was demonstrated by ELISA
(Fig EV1B).
Characterisation of human T-cell activation by recombinant
EpCAM BiTE
The ability of recombinant EpCAM BiTE protein to activate PBMC-
derived T cells was evaluated by adding unstimulated human
primary CD3+ cells to a culture of human DLD colorectal carcinoma
cells, which are known to express EpCAM on their surface (Karlsson
et al, 2008). Addition of 2.5 ng/ml EpCAM BiTE (as supernatant
from transduced HEK293A cells) led to a significant increase in
T-cell activation markers CD69 and CD25 (Fig 1B), whereas the
control BiTE had no effect. Exposure of CD3 cells to the EpCAM
BiTE in the absence of tumour cells gave a very modest increase in
CD69 and CD25, and this indicates that antibody-mediated cluster-
ing of CD3 is essential for full activation by this anti-CD3 binding.
Stimulation with the EpCAM BiTE in the presence of tumour cells
also induced a significant increase in the generation of gamma inter-
feron-producing T cells (Fig 1C) and cell proliferation (Fig 1D),
whereas the control BiTE had no effect. The aim of T-cell activation
by BiTEs is to cause degranulation-mediated cytotoxicity, and
expression of surface CD107a/LAMP1 (indicating degranulation;
Aktas et al, 2009) was strongly upregulated by the EpCAM BiTE but
not by control (Fig 1E).
The release of cytokines following EpCAM BiTE-mediated activa-
tion of PBMC-derived T cells in the presence of DLD cells was
characterised by flow cytometry using a cytokine bead array. As
before, the control BiTE showed little activity, although the EpCAM
BiTE triggered release of several cytokines, including high levels of
IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, gamma interferon and TNF (Fig 1F). Produc-
tion of IL-2, gamma interferon and TNF is generally associated with
a Th1 response, whereas IL-6 and IL-10 are more often linked to a
Th2 response (Mosmann & Sad, 1996).
Specificity of recombinant EpCAM BiTE
Most human epithelial cells express EpCAM, so to assess whether
the effect of the EpCAM BiTE was antigen specific, Chinese hamster
ovary cells (CHO cells) were engineered using a lentiviral vector to

 express human EpCAM on their surface. In the presence of EpCAM
BiTE and CHO-EpCAM cells, exogenously added PBMC-derived
T cells showed strong activation (assessed by CD25 expression
Fig 2A) and associated cytotoxicity (Fig 2B) that was not seen with
parental CHO control cells or control BiTEs. This indicates that the
cytotoxicity of the EpCAM BiTE is antigen specific. We then
assessed whether the EpCAM BiTE would kill a range of tumour
cells, and whether the level of EpCAM BiTE-mediated cytotoxicity
observed was dependent on the density of EpCAM expression. Cyto-
toxicity of T cells in the presence of the EpCAM BiTE was measured
in six different carcinoma cell lines, with greatest cytotoxicity
observed in DLD and A431, and least in A549 and PC3 (Fig 2C).
This
showed
a
significant
association
(Pearson’s
correlation
coefficient, r = 0.7993; p=0.0312), with the surface levels of EpCAM
(determined by flow cytometry), where A549 and PC3 cells showed
the lowest levels and DLD the highest (Fig 2D). This suggests that
the presence and level of EpCAM expression do influence the degree
of cytotoxicity, although other factors (perhaps the intrinsic resis-
tance of cells to granzyme-mediated apoptosis) also play a role in
determining the overall level of cell killing.
BiTE-mediated activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets
To determine which T-cell types are activated by the EpCAM BiTE,

 showed high levels of expression of CD69 and CD25 (Fig 3A),
although the percentage of activated CD4 cells was generally
slightly greater. EpCAM BiTE-mediated T-cell proliferation was
assessed using CFSE stain (Fig 3B), and degranulation by expres-
sion of CD107a/LAMP1 (Fig 3C) and again similar levels of activa-
tion were seen for both CD4+ and CD8+ cells. Finally, levels of
tumour cell cytotoxicity achieved were compared using EpCAM
BiTE to activate purified CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. All T-cell prepa-
rations showed similar cytotoxicity (Fig 3D), indicating that both
CD4+ and CD8+ cells can contribute to the BiTE-mediated cytotox-
icity observed.
Expression of the EpCAM BiTE from oncolytic
adenovirus, EnAdenotucirev
EnAdenotucirev (EnAd) is an oncolytic adenovirus, a chimera of
group B type 11 and type 3 adenovirus with a mosaic E2B region,
a nearly complete E3 deletion and a smaller E4 deletion mapped
to E4orf4 (Kuhn et al, 2008). Currently undergoing several early-
phase clinical trials for treatment of cancer, the virus combines
good systemic pharmacokinetics and promising clinical activity
with the possibility to encode and express transgenes (Calvo et al,
2014; Seymour & Fisher, 2016). The EpCAM BiTE was encoded
within EnAd immediately downstream of the fibre gene, using a
shuttle vector inserted into the virus backbone by Gibson assem-
bly (Fig 4A). The BiTE was placed either under transcriptional
control of a CMV immediate early promoter (EnAd-CMV-EpCAM
BiTE), or was placed downstream of a splice acceptor site for the
adenovirus major late promoter (MLP; EnAd-SA-EpCAM BiTE). In
the former configuration, the BiTE should be expressed and
secreted whenever the virus successfully infects a cell, whereas
expression from the MLP splice acceptor site will occur later on
in the infection cycle only when the MLP is activated in cells that
are permissive to virus replication. A control BiTE (recognising

control viruses.
The viruses were cloned, rescued in HEK293A cells, and a large
batch of each was prepared in a hyperflask and purified twice by
caesium chloride banding, with virus titre and infectious dose of
each determined (Fig EV2A). Infection of DLD with parental EnAd
and the recombinant BiTE viruses yielded similar amounts of viral
genomes (measured by qPCR) at all time points tested, indicating
the BiTE transgene does not interfere with the viral replication
kinetics (Fig 4B). Next, we investigated the replication and oncolytic

 properties of the viruses in the absence of human T cells. DLD cells
were infected with virus batches at increasing virus particles (vp)/
cell, and the cytotoxicity measured by MTS assay on day 5. All of
the recombinant viruses, including those with EpCAM and control
BiTEs, regulated by the CMV promoter or splice acceptor, showed
cytotoxic activity indistinguishable from the parental virus, showing
that the genetic modification had not changed the intrinsic oncolytic
activity of the virus (Fig 4C).
To assess BiTE expression and secretion, the BiTE-expressing
EnAd viruses were used to infect HEK293A cells, and 72-h
supernatants were examined by Western blotting using an anti-His
antibody. As shown in Fig 4D, all four viruses (two expressing the
control BiTE and two expressing the EpCAM BiTE) showed similar
levels of BiTE secreted into the supernatant.
Selective killing of EpCAM-positive cells by virally produced
EpCAM BiTE
The supernatants from EnAd-EpCAM BiTE-infected HEK293A cells
were added to cultures of CHO and CHO-EpCAM cells, either with
or without PBMC-derived T cells; T-cell activation and cytotoxicity
to the CHO/CHO-EpCAM cells were measured after 24 h. In the case
of CHO cells, there was no increase in T-cell expression of CD25
(Fig 4E) nor any cytotoxicity observed with any treatment (Fig 4F).
However, T cells incubated with the CHO-EpCAM cells showed
substantial increases in CD25 expression using supernatants from
HEK293A cells that had been infected with either EnAd-CMV-
EpCAM
BiTE
or
EnAd-SA-EpCAM
BiTE
viruses
(Fig 4E).
As
expected, this translated into selective cytotoxicity to CHO-EpCAM
cells only when T cells were added in the presence of supernatant
from HEK293A cells that had been infected with either EnAd-
CMV-EpCAM BiTE or EnAd-SA-EpCAM BiTE viruses (Fig 4F).
Crucially there was no cytotoxicity in the absence of T cells, or
when using supernatants from HEK293A that cells had been infected
with EnAd expressing the control BiTE.
Superior cytotoxicity of EnAd expressing EpCAM BiTE
EnAd kills most carcinoma cells quickly by direct oncolysis (Kuhn
et al, 2008), although some cells—notably SKOV3 ovarian carci-
noma cells—are partially resistant and killed more slowly. We
therefore reasoned that the consequences of arming EnAd to secrete
EpCAM BiTE, leading to cytotoxic activation of T cells, might be
particularly evident in SKOV3 cells. Cells were therefore exposed to
virus (100 vp/cell) 24 h after seeding and cell death monitored by
xCELLigence system. PBMC-derived T cells were added (or not) to
the SKOV3 cell culture 2 h later. In the absence of T cells, the
tumour cells grew for approximately 72 h (manifest by the increas-
ing Cell Index signal in Fig 5A), but cell growth then reached a
plateau and remained stable, independent of virus infection, up
until at least 160 h. All tested viruses, including parental EnAd,
induced no observable target cell cytotoxicity during the time
measured. However, when co-cultured with PBMC-derived T cells,
both the CMV- and SA-EpCAM BiTE-armed viruses induced rapid
SKOV3 lysis, with CMV-driven induced lysis within 16 h, and SA
within 44 h following addition of T cells (Fig 5B). Importantly,
parental EnAd or the non-specific BiTE control viruses demonstrated
no target cell lysis in this time frame even with the addition of
T cells. This result was confirmed by LDH assay, in which co-
cultures identical to above were set up, with cytotoxicity measured
at 24, 48 and 96 h post-infection (Fig EV2B and C). These results
are further supported by similar findings in DLD cells in which
EpCAM BiTE-expressing viruses induced cytotoxicity at a signifi-
cantly quicker rate than the control BiTE viruses (Fig EV3A and B).
To confirm that target cell cytotoxicity is mediated via T-cell activa-
tion, CD3 cells were harvested at each time point and activation
status determined by CD69 and CD25 expression, demonstrating
similar kinetics of expression as observed for cytotoxicity (Figs 5C
and D, and EV3C and D). The approximate quantity of EpCAM BiTE
produced from infected DLD cells was determined by comparing
cytotoxicity (Abs490) induced by infected DLD supernatants to the
cytotoxicity induced by known quantities of recombinant BiTE [i.e.
creation of a standard curve (Abs490)]. DLD cells in co-culture with
CD3-purified PBMC (1:5) were incubated with recombinant BiTE
(Fig EV3Ei) or supernatants harvested from infected DLD cells
(Fig EV3Eii) and LDH release was measured at 24 h. This allowed
us to determine that EpCAM BiTE was produced at 165 lg and
50 lg per million DLD for EnAd-CMV-EpCAMBiTE and EnAd-
SA-EpCAMBiTE, respectively. The EC50 for the EpCAM BiTE is
7.4 ng/ml (Fig EV3E), and therefore, EpCAM BiTE is produced by
the recombinant virus at levels that are likely to reach therapeutic
doses.

EpCAM BiTE and EnAd-EpCAMBiTE can overcome immune
suppression, activate endogenous T cells and kill endogenous
tumour cells within malignant peritoneal ascites
Three clinical samples of malignant peritoneal ascites containing
EpCAM-positive tumour cells and primary fibroblasts (as control,
non-EpCAM-expressing cells) were expanded ex vivo and the
mixed primary cell populations were incubated with PBMC-derived
T cells and treated with free BiTE or 100 vp/cell EnAd-EpCAMBiTE
in culture medium. After 72 h, the level of EpCAM-positive
target cells (Fig 6A) or non-target fibroblast activation protein
(FAP)-positive fibroblasts (Fig 6B) was measured by flow cytom-
etry. Activation of T cells was analysed by measuring CD25
expression (Fig 6C). Treatment of the samples with free EpCAM
BiTE and the EpCAM BiTE-expressing viruses led to strong T-cell

 activation (measured by CD25 expression), and a depletion of
EpCAM-positive tumour cells to background levels, although
FAP-positive (EpCAM-negative) fibroblasts showed no change in
numbers.
This
was
observed
in
all
the
patients’
samples,
and none of the other treatments (using the control BiTEs)
showed any T-cell activation or cytotoxicity. This demonstrates
that the EpCAM BiTE (either free or encoded within an oncolytic
virus) can mediate activation of PBMC-derived T cells and selec-
tive cytotoxicity to human tumour cells in malignant peritoneal
ascites.
Malignant
exudates
represent
an
environment
of
potential
immune tolerance with suppressed immune responses commonly
observed in patients with late-stage metastatic cancer. The levels
of IL-10, considered to be an anti-inflammatory cytokine, were
measured in serum from three healthy donors and malignant
exudates from 12 patients with peritoneal (A) or pleural (P)
malignancies
(seven
peritoneal
ascites—six
ovarian
and
one
breast; five pleural—one colorectal, one lymphoma, one lung and
two epithelioid mesothelioma). Consistent with the hypothesis
that the exudates represent an environment of T-cell immune
suppression, IL-10 levels in the exudates (88.1–633.4 pg/ml, mean
375 pg/ml) were far in excess of those measured in normal serum
(7.2–10.0 pg/ml, mean 8.9 pg/ml; Fig 7A). The effects of these
fluids on T-cell activation was investigated by polyclonally stimu-
lating PBMC-derived T cells with anti-CD3/CD28 beads that mimic
in vivo T-cell activation in the presence of normal serum, ascites
or pleural fluid (all 50%). Whereas in normal serum the anti-
CD3/CD28 beads reproducibly gave approximately 60% of T cells
dual positive for both CD25 and CD69, the presence of ascites
fluid attenuated T-cell activation in 6/12 fluids (Fig 7B). This was
strongly correlative with a suppression in T-cell degranulation
(Pearson coefficient, r = 0.8951; P < 0.0001), with CD107a-positive
T cells reduced in 10/12 fluids, and was particularly pronounced
for patient fluids A1, A2, A7, P3 and P4 (Fig 7C). Importantly,
T-cell degranulation negatively correlated with levels of IL-10 in
the patient fluids (Pearson coefficient, r = �0.7645; P = 0.0038).
This supports our notion that components of malignant ascites
and pleural fluid may exert an immune-suppressive or tolerising
effect.
T-cell activation via BiTEs may be able to bypass tumour
microenvironment-associated mechanisms of T-cell immunosup-
pression (Nakamura & Smyth, 2016). We therefore investigated the
ability of PBMC-derived T cells and EpCAM BiTE to mediate T-cell
activation
(CD69,
CD25)
and
degranulation
(CD107a)
in
the
presence of normal serum or seven patient malignant exudate
samples, of which six were known to be immunosuppressive to
T-cell activation by the CD3/CD28 beads (see above). Remarkably,
0/7 fluids attenuated the BiTE-mediated increase in dual-positive
CD69+/CD25+ cells, with four actually supporting modest increases
in BiTE-mediated T-cell activation compared to normal serum
(Fig 7D). Two fluids (A7 and P4) reduced T-cell degranulation
(measured by CD107a); however, the decrease induced by A7 was
modest (Fig 7E).
Notably, BiTE-mediated T-cell activation was more potent than
CD3/CD28 beads, giving higher levels of dual-positive CD69+/
CD25+ cells (67.6 vs. 58.9%) and degranulation measured by
CD107a (42.9 vs. 22%). Finally, we assessed the ability of BiTEs to
activate T-cell cytotoxicity to SKOV3 target cells in the presence of
immunosuppressive ascites or pleural fluid following infection with
EnAd-SA-control BiTE or EnAd-SA-EpCAMBiTE. PBMC-derived T
cells were incubated with normal serum (50%) or four patient fluids
(A1, A2, A7, P4) and cytotoxicity evaluated by xCELLigence. All
samples showed similar profiles of cytotoxicity to SKOV3 cells,
indicating that the virus-encoded BiTEs can overcome the immune-
suppressive components of the malignant effusions (including
samples A7 and P4) and mediate functional cytotoxicity of T cells
(Fig 7F).
In addition to the immune-suppressive fluid and tumour cells
present, ascites and pleural effusion samples contain tumour-
associated
lymphocytes
and
supporting
cells
of
the
tumour
stroma, providing a unique tumour-like model system to test
BiTE-mediated activation of endogenous patient-derived T cells.
The cell types present in patient samples were screened by flow
cytometry, with representative FSC-SSC plots illustrated in Fig 8A.
Following incubation of total endogenous cells (from patient
sample in Fig 8A, effector:target (E:T) ratio 0.49) and ascites fluid
with free recombinant BiTE or virus encoding BiTE, activation of
endogenous patient T cells was assessed. After 24-h incubation,
the EpCAM BiTE (but not the control BiTE) induced CD69 and
CD25 expression, similar to that observed in culture medium
(Fig 8B). This effect was persistent, and after 5 days, only ascites
cells receiving free EpCAM BiTE or virus encoding EpCAM BiTE
showed CD25 expression on T cells, with slightly higher levels
seen when cells were cultured in the ascites fluid than in RPMI
media (Fig 8C). Interestingly, free EpCAM BiTE and EnAd-CMV-
EpCAMBiTE mediated proliferation of T cells in whole ascites
fluid, and not in basic media, suggesting that basic culture media
may lack factors required to support viability or proliferation of

 the ascites T cells (Fig 8D). The absence of an increase in CD3+
cells following EnAd-SA-EpCAMBiTE treatment at this time point
may reflect the later onset of expression kinetics relative to the
CMV promoter. Cytotoxicity was assessed by measuring residual
level of EpCAM cells by flow cytometry. Free EpCAM BiTE and
the virus encoding EpCAM BiTE (CMV and SA) caused a similar
depletion of EpCAM cells when the experiment was performed in
medium and also in 50% ascites fluid (Fig 8E). These data show
that the EpCAM BiTE can overcome the immune-suppressive
effects of peritoneal ascites or pleural fluid to activate endogenous
T cells to kill endogenous tumour cells.
Identification of malignant exudate cells expressing transgenes
To determine which cells were infected by the EnAd virus, and
which cells would produce and secrete BiTEs, we evaluated infec-
tion patterns using reporter viruses (EnAd-CMV-GFP and EnAd-
SA-GFP). The viruses were added to whole cells isolated from
malignant exudates by centrifugation and resuspended in 50%
exudate fluid. After 72 h, fluorescence microscopy showed that
EnAd-CMV-GFP (which is expected to express GFP transgene in
all cells that are infected) showed expression in cells of a range
of morphologies (Fig EV4A), whereas EnAd-SA-GFP (which is
designed to express GFP transgene only in cells supporting virus
replication) was restricted to plump, round cells. Flow cytometry
showed that the GFP expression from EnAd-CMV-GFP was found
in
many
macrophages
(CD11b+)
as
well
as
EpCAM+ cells,
whereas EnAd-SA-GFP expression was restricted to EpCAM+ cells
(Fig EV4B). This supports the notion that EnAd-CMV-EpCAM
BiTE will express BiTEs in a range of cells within the malignant
effusions, whereas EnAd-SA-EpCAM BiTE will be restricted mainly
to tumour cells.
EpCAM BiTE and EnAd-EpCAMBiTE show reproducible activity
within a range of malignant peritoneal and pleural exudates
To assess inter-patient variability of the EpCAM BiTE-expressing
viruses in this highly clinically relevant setting, we obtained several
samples of pathological exudates from patients with a range of
malignancies. At initial screening, samples considered suitable for
further analysis were those containing CD3- and EpCAM-positive
cells, having a wide range of E:T (CD3+:EpCAM+) ratios (Fig 9 see
legend). We also assessed the expression of PD1 by endogenous T
cells following their initial isolation, and whereas only 10% of
PBMC-derived T cells express PD1, all the malignant exudate
samples T cells were on average 65% positive for PD1 and reached
sometimes as high as 93% (Fig EV5).
Total exudate cells (prepared as above) were incubated at fixed
concentrations in 50% exudate fluid in the presence of 500 ng/ml
free EpCAM BiTE or 100 vp/cell virus encoding BiTE. After 5 days,
the total cell population was harvested, and the total number of
CD3+ cells (Fig 9A) was measured. Compared to untreated controls,
only samples receiving the free EpCAM BiTE or EnAd encoding
EpCAM BiTE showed T-cell proliferation. This confirms that the
EpCAM BiTE was binding to the EpCAM target and cross-linking
CD3 to stimulate endogenous T cells. Treatment with the EpCAM
BiTE, EnAd-CMV-EpCAM BiTE and EnAd-SA-EpCAM BiTE typically
expanded the T-cell numbers by factors of up to 30-fold. The free
and virally encoded EpCAM BiTE also induced significant T-cell acti-
vation of tumour-associated lymphocytes (assessed by CD25 expres-
sion) in all patients’ samples, even within the likely immune-
tolerising environment of the malignant exudate fluid (Fig 9B).
There was noticeable variation between patients, with activation
ranging from 50% to 95% dependent on the donor. This might
reflect the broad range of E:T ratios between patients (ranging from

 of EpCAM-positive cells by flow cytometry at the end of the
5-day incubation (Fig 9C). The free EpCAM BiTE and the two
viruses encoding EpCAM BiTE caused a marked depletion of
autologous EpCAM-expressing cells in every case, whereas the
other treatments had little or no effect on the level of EpCAM+
cells. In most patients, EnAd expressing the EpCAM BiTE showed
similar levels of T-cell activation and targeted cytotoxicity inde-
pendent of whether BiTE expression was regulated by the CMV
promoter or the SA system. However, one patient (patient 3)
showed higher T-cell expression of CD25 using the EnAd-SA-
EpCAM BiTE compared to EnAd-CMV-EpCAM BiTE, although the
levels
of
T-cell
proliferation
and
associated
cytotoxicity
to
EpCAM+ cells were similar for both. The reason for this finding
is currently unclear, although it might indicate that even partial
T-cell activation is sufficient to eradicate tumour cells in this
patient sample.
The different effects of parental EnAd and EnAd-SA-EpCAM BiTE
are shown by microscopy in Fig 9D, where expression of the BiTE
decreases the presence of tumour cells (seen as large, plump cells)
and expands the T-cell population (small round cells). The associ-
ated flow cytometry plots confirm the substantial expansion and
activation of T cells following treatment with the EpCAM BiTE-
expressing virus.
Finally, we characterised the effects of the various treatments by
measuring the levels of key cytokines produced using a LEGEN-
Dplex protein array (Fig 9E). By far, the greatest fold increases were
in gamma interferon, which rose nearly 1,000-fold following treat-
ment with the free EpCAM BiTE or EnAd encoding EpCAM BiTE.
These two treatments also caused approximately 10-fold increases
in expression of IL-5, IL-13, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), IL17A
and IL17F, characteristic of activated T cells. EnAd alone (or
expressing the control BiTE) also caused a 10-fold rise in gamma
interferon, but otherwise no treatments caused any appreciable
changes in cytokine expression.
Discussion
Oncolytic viruses offer an intriguing new strategy to combine
several therapeutic modalities within a single targeted, self-ampli-
fying agent (Keller & Bell, 2016; Seymour & Fisher, 2016). As they
replicate selectively within cancer cells and spread from cell to cell,
some oncolytic viruses are thought to mediate cell death by non-
apoptotic death pathways (Ingemarsdotter et al, 2010; Li et al,
2013), as part of the process allowing virus particles to escape from
dying cells. EnAd, in particular, kills cells by a pro-inflammatory
process known as oncosis or ischaemic cell death (Dyer et al, 2017).
This non-apoptotic death mechanism causes release of several pro-
inflammatory cellular components, such as ATP, HMGB1 and expo-
sure
of
calreticulin
(known
as
damage-associated
molecular
patterns, DAMPs) (Weerasinghe & Buja, 2012), and is likely pivotal
to the ability of the virus to promote an effective anticancer immune
response. In addition to the consequences of direct lysis, however,
viruses offer the potential to encode and express other anticancer
biologics, obviating delivery challenges and ensuring the biologic
achieves
its
highest
concentration
within
the
tumour
micro-
environment. Imlygic encodes GM-CSF; however, the potential for
arming viruses is virtually limitless and provides many exciting
opportunities to design multimodal therapeutic strategies with addi-
tive or synergistic anticancer effects (Hermiston & Kuhn, 2002; de
Gruijl et al, 2015).
Encoding BiTEs within oncolytic viruses provides a powerful
means to activate tumour infiltrating lymphocytes to become cyto-
toxic and lyse antigen-positive target cells, providing a completely
separate therapeutic modality from the effects of direct viral lysis. In
this study, we have shown that BiTE-targeted cytotoxicity is fully
antigen specific, can be mediated by both CD4 and CD8 T cells
(Brischwein et al, 2006) and can be incorporated into an oncolytic
adenovirus and expressed only in cells that allow virus replication.
In addition, the current study shows, for the first time, that endoge-
nous T cells within liquid cancer biopsies can be activated by BiTEs
and virus-encoded BiTEs and can kill endogenous tumour cells
without any additional stimulation or reversal of immune suppres-
sion. Importantly, this can happen even in the primary fluids that
comprise the microenvironment of peritoneal ascites or pleural effu-
sions, as surrogates for the immune-suppressive microenvironment
of solid tumours.
It is feasible that BiTEs may be able to overcome tumour-
associated
immune-suppressive
effects
that
limit
physiological
immune responses, simply by providing excessive stimulation to T
cells through simultaneous clustering of multiple CD3 molecules.
Since BiTEs employ an antibody structure to recognise cell surface
antigens, without the need for HLA presentation, the number of
antigens recognised by an individual BiTE may be very large. For
example, EpCAM is expressed at levels up to 1x106 copies/cell on
malignant exudates (Yao et al, 2013). In contrast, most class I
HLA molecules are present at < 100,000 copies per cell, and each
can contain just one from thousands of different HLA-associated
peptides (Schellens et al, 2015), meaning that the number of
targets for a specific T cell will likely be less than a hundred per
cell (Purbhoo et al, 2006). T-cell regulation, including checkpoint-
mediated suppression, has likely evolved to be active in this range
of stimulus—hence, it may be possible for BiTE-mediated recogni-
tion of targets to overcome pathophysiological inhibition mecha-
nism simply by excessive stimulatory T-cell signalling. Arming
oncolytic viruses to express BiTEs combines two quite distinct
therapeutic mechanisms, with the former providing lytic death of
tumour cells that are permissive for virus infection, and the latter
targeting T-cell cytotoxicity via a specific, chosen, antigen. This
provides considerable flexibility in the design of a therapeutic
approach, perhaps using the BiTEs to deliver cytotoxicity to
tumour-associated cells that are relatively resistant to kill by the
virus directly. For example, while we have exemplified the tech-
nology here using a BiTE that recognises a carcinoma-associated
antigen (EpCAM), it is also possible to use the BiTE approach to
target cytotoxicity to tumour-associated fibroblasts or other stromal
cells. Indeed, even when the targets for BiTE recognition are not
restricted to expression in the tumour microenvironment, by link-
ing BiTE production to virus replication allows expression of the
BiTE to be spatially restricted to the tumour, minimising systemic
toxicities. This is important, as BiTEs administered intravenously
show relatively short circulation kinetics (Klinger et al, 2012) and
are often associated with considerable on-target off-tumour toxici-
ties (Teachey et al, 2013).
The possibility to encode BiTEs within oncolytic viruses has
been previously explored using an oncolytic vaccinia virus with an

 Ephrin A2-targeting BiTE. This agent showed that the Ephrin BiTE
could mediate activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) and antigen-targeted killing of tumour cells both in vitro
and in vivo. Intriguingly, although the BiTE could activate T cells,
it did not lead to T-cell proliferation without the addition of exoge-
nous IL-2, whereas the BiTE used in the current study led to exten-
sive proliferation both of PBMC in vitro and of tumour-associated
lymphocytes using the clinical biopsy samples ex vivo. Encoura-
gingly, an adenovirus armed with an EGFR-targeted BiTE has also
achieved T-cell proliferation in vitro in the absence of IL-2 (Fajardo
et al, 2017). The reason for this difference in behaviour is
currently unknown, although it may reflect the different BiTE
design, the different oncolytic virus used or perhaps depend on
the antigen density giving sufficient cross-linking of CD3 on the
T cells.
One central aim of oncolytic virus therapy is to create an anti-
cancer T-cell response that recognises patient-specific neoantigens
as well as “public” tumour-associated antigens. Lytic viruses may
do this by stimulating improved antigen presentation by lysing
tumour cells in the context of DAMPs alongside virus-related
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Immunohisto-
chemical staining of resected colon tumours, following intravenous
delivery of EnAd, suggests the virus promotes a strong influx of
CD8+ T cells into tumour tissue (R Garcia-Carbonero, E Calvo,
R Salazar, I Duran, I Osman-Garcia, L Paz-Ares, JM Bozada, V Boni,
C Blanc, L Seymour, S Alvis, B Champion, KD Fisher, Submitted).
However, while this is potentially a very powerful approach, adap-
tive T-cell responses are ultimately dependent on the expression of
MHC class I antigens by tumour cells, to allow targeted killing. Loss
of MHC expression is a well-documented immune evasion strategy
for tumours (Garrido et al, 2016). It is noteworthy that both cyto-
toxic strategies that are immediately engaged by BiTE-armed onco-
lytic viruses operate independently of MHC class I by the tumour
cells, and therefore can be employed to kill cancer cells even when
tumour cells have lost MHC expression.
Encoding BiTEs within EnAd provides a particularly promising
strategy to achieve targeted expression in disseminated tumours,
exploiting the known blood stability and systemic bioavailability of
the virus, which has now been studied in several early-phase clini-
cal trials. Notably, in a study where the virus is given intravenously
a few days prior to resection of primary colon cancer, subsequent
immunohistological assessment of tumour sections showed that the
virus had reached to regions through the tumours and gave strong
intranuclear hexon signals, indicating successful infection and virus
replication selectively in tumour cells. This confirms preclinical data
(Di et al, 2014; Illingworth et al, 2017) indicating that this virus is
stable in 100% human blood and should be capable of tumour-
targeted infection of disseminated and metastatic malignancies in
human patients.
Bispecific T-cell engagers could be encoded by EnAd without
any loss of oncolytic virulence (Fig 4C), reflecting the considerable
transgene packaging capacity of the virus. The presence of the
transgene will not affect the physicochemical properties of the
virus particles; hence, the modified viruses should exhibit exactly
the same clinical pharmacokinetics as the parental agent, and
should be capable of expressing the encoded BiTE selectively
within tumours throughout the body. This provides an exciting
and
potentially
very
effective
new
approach
to
systemically
targeted cancer immunotherapy that should now be prioritised for
clinical assessment.
Materials and Methods
Cell lines
HEK293A, DLD, SKOV3, MCF7, A431, A549, NHDF and PC3 cells
(ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM, Sigma-Aldrich, UK) and CHO cells (ATCC) in Roswell Park
Memorial Institute (RPMI-1640, Sigma-Aldrich, UK). All cell lines
were authenticated by STR profiling (CRUK Cambridge Institute).
Growth media was supplemented with 10% (v/v) foetal bovine
serum (FBS, Gibco, UK) and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin
(10 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) and cells maintained in humidified
atmosphere at 37°C and 5% CO2. For virus infections and virus plas-
mid transfections, cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented
with 2% FBS. For recombinant BiTE plasmid transfections, cells
were maintained in DMEM without FBS. EpCAM expression of
target cell lines was determined by flow cytometry. All cell lines
were routinely tested for mycoplasma using MycoAlert
TM Myco-
plasma Detection Kit (Lonza) and were free from contamination
during the course of these studies.

The protein sequence of the EpCAM gene (ID: 4072) was obtained
from NCBI database and DNA synthesised by Oxford Genetics Ltd
(Oxford, UK). The EpCAM gene was cloned into pSF-Lenti vector by
standard cloning techniques producing the pSF-Lenti-EpCAM vector.
HEK293T cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 with
lentivirus

alongside
pSF-CMV-HIV-
Gag-Pol, pSF-CMV-VSV-G, pSF-CMV-HIV-Rev (Oxford Genetics Ltd).
Supernatants containing lentivirus were harvested 48 h later and
mixed with polybrene (8 lg/ml). Lentivirus/polybrene mixtures
were added to CHO cells and incubated at 37°C. On day 4, the
supernatant was exchanged for media containing 7.5 lg/ml puro-
mycin. Stable variants were then clonally selected and EpCAM
expression of the parental cell lines or stable-transfected variant was
determined by antibody staining with EpCAM or isotope control
antibody and analysed by flow cytometry. Positive clones were
expanded and used in further experiments.
Preparation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and
T-cell isolation
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by density gradi-
ent centrifugation (Boyum, 1968) from whole blood leucocyte
cones obtained from the NHS Blood and Transplant UK (Oxford,
UK). Blood was diluted 1:2 with PBS and layered onto Ficoll
(1,079 g/ml, Ficoll-Paque Plus, GE Healthcare) before centrifuga-
tion at 400 g for 30 min at 22°C with low deceleration. After
centrifugation, PBMCs were collected and washed twice with PBS
(300 g for 10 min at room temperature) and resuspended in RPMI-
1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. For extraction of CD3-
positive T cells from PBMCs, non-CD3 cells were depleted using
Pan T Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, #130-096-535), according

 to the manufacturer’s protocol. For further isolation of CD4- and
CD8-positive T cells, CD3 T cells underwent another round of puri-
fication using CD4+ Microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, #130-045-101).
Processing primary ascites and pleural effusions
Primary human malignant ascites and pleural effusion samples were
received from the Churchill Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals
(Oxford, UK) following informed consent from patients with multi-
ple indications of advanced carcinoma, including but not limited to
ovarian, pancreatic, breast and lung. This work was approved by
the research ethics committee of the Oxford Centre for Histopathol-
ogy Research (Reference 09/H0606/5+5). Upon receipt, cellular and
fluid fractions were separated and fluid used immediately or
aliquots stored at �20°C for future analysis. The cellular fraction
was treated with red blood cell lysis buffer (Roche, UK) following
manufacturer’s instructions. Cell number and viability were deter-
mined by trypan blue stain. Cell types present in each sample were
determined by antibody staining for EpCAM, EGFR, FAP, CD45,
CD11b, CD56, CD3, CD4, CD8, PD1 and CTLA4 and analysed by
flow cytometry. For ex vivo T-cell activation and target cell lysis
experiments, fresh cells and fluid were used. In some cases, the
adherent cells were passaged in DMEM supplemented with 10%
FBS and expanded for later use.
BiTE engineering and production
Bispecific T-cell engagers were generated by joining two scFvs with
specificities against EpCAM or CD3e with a flexible (G4S)3 linker.
Each scFv was created by the joining of VH and VL domains from
parental monoclonal antibodies (EpCAM, mAb 5–10; CD3e, L2K) by
a linker. Each BiTE possessed an immunoglobulin light chain (Ig)
N-terminal signal sequence for mammalian secretion and a C-term-
inal decahistidine affinity tag for detection and purification. BiTEs
were engineered by standard DNA cloning techniques and inserted
into a protein expression vector (pSF-CMV-Amp) for cytomegalo-
virus (CMV) promoter-driven constitutive protein expression and
secretion.
pSF-CMV-EpCAMBiTE or pSF-CMV-ControlBiTE plasmid DNA
was transfected into HEK293A cells using polyethylenimine (PEI,
linear, MW 25,000, Polysciences, USA) and under the following
conditions, 55 lg of plasmid DNA:110 lg PEI (DNA:PEI ratio of 1:2
(w/w)) was added to cells, incubated at 37°C for 4 h, then replaced
with fresh serum-free DMEM and further incubated at 37°C, 5%
CO2 for 48 h. Cells were transfected in parallel with pSF-CMV-GFP
to ensure transfection efficiency. To harvest secreted protein, the
supernatant of transfected cells was collected and centrifuged at
350 g, 4°C for 5 min to remove cell components. Supernatants were
transferred to 10,000 MWCO Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter
Units (Millipore). After centrifugation at 4,750 g and 4°C, the
volume of the retentate was adjusted with the flow through to
obtain a 50-fold higher concentration. Aliquots of concentrated
protein were stored at �80°C.
Generation of BiTE-expressing EnAdenotucirev
The
plasmids
pEnAd2.4-CMV-EpCAMBiTE,
pEnAd2.4-SA-Ep
CAMBiTE, pEnAd2.4-CMV-ControlBiTE, pEnAd2.4-SA-ControlBiTE
were generated by direct insertion of the transgene cassette encod-
ing the EpCAM BiTE or control BiTE into the basic EnAd plasmid
pEnAd2.4 using Gibson assembly technology (Gibson et al, 2009;
Marino et al, 2017). The transgene cassette contained a 50 short
splice acceptor sequence or an exogenous CMV promoter, followed
downstream by the EpCAM or control BiTE cDNA sequence and a 30
polyadenylation sequence. A schematic of the inserted transgene
cassette is shown in Fig 4A. Correct construction of the plasmid
was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmids EnAd2.4-CMV-
EpCAMBiTE,
pEnAd2.4-SA-EpCAMBiTE,
pEnAd2.4-CMV-Control-
BiTE and pEnAd2.4-SA-ControlBiTE were linearised by restriction
digest with the enzyme AscI prior to transfection in HEK293A cells.
The production of virus was monitored by observation of cytopathic
effect (CPE) in the cell monolayer. Once extensive CPE was
observed the virus was harvested from HEK293A cells by three
freeze-thaw cycles. Single virus clones were selected by serially
diluting harvested lysate and re-infecting HEK293A cells, and
harvesting wells containing single plaques. Serial infections of
HEK293A cells were performed once an infection had reached full
CPE in order to amplify the virus stocks. Once potent virus stocks
were amplified, the viruses were purified by double caesium chlo-
ride banding to produce EnAd-CMV-EpCAMBiTE, EnAd-SA-EpCAM-
BiTE, EnAd-CMV-ControlBiTE, EnAd-SA-ControlBiTE virus stocks.
These stocks were titred by TCID50 (50% tissue culture infective
dose) and PicoGreen assay (Life Technologies), following manufac-
turer’s instructions.
Preparation of supernatants
To evaluate BiTE-mediated cytokine release, DLD cells (20,000)
were plated with 100,000 CD3+ T cells in 96-well flat-bottom plate
alone or with 2 ng/ll EpCAM or control BiTE. After 48-h incubation
at 37°C and 5% CO2, supernatants were collected, cell components
removed by centrifugation and aliquots stored at �20°C. To assess
BiTE transgene expression from recombinant viruses, HEK293A
(1e6) or DLD cells (1.2e6) were infected with EnAd-CMV-EpCAM-
BiTE,
EnAd-SA-EpCAMBiTE,
EnAd-CMV-ControlBiTE,
EnAd-SA-
ControlBiTE or EnAd at 100 vp/cell. Cells were cultured for 72 h at
which point the cytopathic effect (CPE) was advanced. Supernatants
were collected and centrifuged for 5 min, 300 g to remove cell
debris and stored at �20°C for future analysis.
Immunoblotting
Dot blot was used to measure the concentration of recombinant
BiTE produced from plasmid transfections. Two-fold serial dilutions
of each BiTE and of a protein standard (10×His-tagged (C-terminus)
human cathepsin D, Biolegend, #556704) were prepared. The molar
concentration of the protein standard was adjusted to represent a
BiTE concentration of 100 lg/ml. Two microlitres of each sample
and protein standard was directly applied onto a nitrocellulose
membrane. The membrane was air-dried, blocked and probed with
a-6xHis (C-terminus) antibody (1:5,000, clone 3D5, Invitrogen, UK,
#46-0693)
for
detection
of
C-terminally
His-tagged
proteins,
followed by washing and incubation with anti-mouse secondary
antibody (1:10,000, Dako, #P0161) and detected by application of
SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Thermo
Fisher,
#34075)
according
to
manufacturer’s
instructions.

 Supernatants of virus-infected HEK293A cells were analysed by
Western blotting for BiTE expression. Supernatants were fraction-
ated by SDS–PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane
according to manufacturer’s protocols (Bio-Rad). Membranes were
further treated identically to that of dot blot protocol above.
Enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA)
To assess EpCAM binding, ELISA plates were prepared by coating
overnight at 4°C with human EpCAM/TROP-1 protein (50 ng/well,
Sino Biological Inc, #10694-H02H-50). Plates were blocked for 1 h
at ambient temperature with 5% BSA, followed by incubation with
diluted EpCAM BiTE-, Control BiTE- and empty pSF-CMV vector-
transfected HEK293A supernatants (2 h, room temperature). Plates
were washed three times with PBS-T and subsequently after every
future binding step. Plates were incubated with anti-His (C-term)
antibody (1:5,000, clone 3D5, #46-0693, Invitrogen, UK) for 1 h,
room temperature, followed by HRP conjugated anti-mouse-Fc
(1:1,000 in PBS/5% milk, Dako) for 1 h at room temperature. HRP
detection was performed using 3.3.5.50-tetramethylethylenediamine
(TMB, Thermo Fisher), and stop solution was used for terminating
the reaction. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured on a Wallac
1420 plate reader (Perkin Elmer).
Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry analysis was performed on a FACSCalibur flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences) and data processed with
FlowJo
v10.0.7r2 software (TreeStar Inc., USA). A representative example
of analysis of flow cytometry data is shown in Appendix Fig S1. For
classification of different cellular populations, antibodies specific for
CD45 (HI30, Biolegend), CD11b (ICRF44, Biolegend), EpCAM (9C4,
Biolegend) and FAP (427819, R&D Systems) were used. For analysis
of T-cell populations, the following antibody clones coupled to dif-
ferent fluorophores were used: CD69 (FN50, Biolegend), CD25
(BC96, Biolegend), IFNc (4S.B3, Biolegend), aCD107a antibody
(H4A3, Biolegend), CD3 (HIT3a, Biolegend), CD4 (OKT4, Biole-
gend), CD8a (HIT8a, Biolegend), PD1 (H4A3, Biolegend). In each
case, the appropriate isotype control antibody was used.
Characterisation of human T-cell activation
CD69 and CD25 expression levels
The ability of the recombinant EpCAM BiTE or EpCAM BiTE viruses
to induce T-cell activation was assessed by surface expression of
CD69 and CD25. Human CD3 cells (75,000 cells/well in 96-well flat-
bottom plates) from PBMC or ascites samples were cultured alone
or with DLD, SKOV3, CHO, CHO-EpCAM or ascites target cells
(15,000) in the presence of media alone, EpCAM or control BiTE
protein (2 ng/ll) or recombinant virus (100 vp/cell). CD3 cells were
incubated with CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher, #11131D) as
positive control for T-cell activation. Cells were cultured for 24 h at
37°C unless stated otherwise and subsequently harvested with
enzyme-free cell-dissociation buffer (Gibco, #13151014). Total cells
were stained with antibodies for surface expression of CD69, CD25,
CD3, CD4 or CD8 and analysed by flow cytometry. The effect of
ascites fluid on T-cell activation (CD69, CD25, CD107a) was investi-
gated by polyclonally activating CD3-purified PBMC (100,000) by
incubating
with
CD3/CD28
Dynabeads
as
per
manufacturer’s
instructions) in RPMI-1640 or fluids isolated from the malignant
ascites samples.
IFNc expression
The ability of the EpCAM BiTE to induce T-cell activity was assessed
by IFNc expression, by co-culture of T cells for 6 h with DLD cells
(200,000 CD3 cells/well, 40,000 DLD cells/well in a flat-bottom
96-well plate) and 2 ng/ll recombinant EpCAM or control BiTE. As
a positive control, T cells were stimulated with soluble PMA/iono-
mycin cell activation cocktail (Biolegend, #423301). Brefeldin A
(GolgiPlug, BD Biosciences) was added into the culture medium 5 h
before harvest, at which point CD3+ T cells were harvested and
intracellularly stained for IFNc expression and analysed by flow
cytometry.
T-cell proliferation
To study T-cell proliferation, 100,000 CFSE-labelled (CellTrace CFSE
kit, Invitrogen, #C34554) CD3+ T cells were incubated with 20,000
DLD cells in 96-well plate format, with 2 ng/ll EpCAM or control
BiTE. Five days after co-culture, cells were stained for CD3, CD4 or
CD8 and CFSE fluorescence of viable CD3+ T cells was measured by
flow cytometry, with total cell number normalised using precision
counting beads (5,000/well, Biolegend, #424902). Fluorescence data
were analysed and modelled using the proliferation function of
FlowJo v7.6.5 software. Data are presented as the percentage of
original cells that entered a proliferation cycle (%divided) or the
average number of cell divisions that a cell in the original popula-
tion has undergone (Division Index).
CD107a degranulation
DLD cells (15,000 cells/well) were co-cultured with 75,000 CD3+ T
cells in a flat-bottom 96-well plate in the presence of media alone or
2 ng/ll of control or EpCAM BiTE. aCD107a or isotype control anti-
bodies were added directly to the culture medium. Monensin
(GolgiStop, BD Biosciences) was added after 1 h of incubation at
37°C and 5% CO2, followed by 5 h of further incubation. Cells were
subsequently harvested, stained for CD3, CD4 or CD8 and analysed
by flow cytometry.
Cytokine release
Cytokines within supernatants harvested from cultures of DLD/
PBMC or pleural effusion cells were quantified using the LEGEN-
Dplex Human T Helper Cytokine panel (Biolegend, #740001) and
flow cytometry following the manufacturer’s instructions. Cytokines
included in the analysis are IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13,
IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, IFNc and TNFa.
In vitro target cell cytotoxicity assay
Target cell cytotoxicity mediated by recombinant BiTE or viruses
was assessed by LDH release or MTS assay. Target cells (DLD,
SKOV3,
HT-29,
A431,
A549,
PC3,
CHO,
CHO-EpCAM)
were
co-cultured with CD3, CD4 or CD8 T cells (E:T 5:1) in a flat-bottom
96-well plate in the presence of media alone, diluted supernatants
or virus (100 vp/cell). After 24 h of co-culture (unless stated other-

as
per
manufacturer’s
instructions. Quantity of BiTE produced from virus-infected DLD
cells was determined by comparing cytotoxicity induced by diluted
viral supernatants to that of a standard curve generated using
recombinant BiTE. To evaluate oncolytic activity of the viruses,
DLD cells were seeded in 96-well plate (25,000 cells/well) for 18 h
at 37°C and 5% CO2, before infection with increasing vp/cell (five-
fold serial dilution, 100 to 5.12e-5 vp/cell) or left uninfected. DLD
cytotoxicity was measured on day 5 by MTS viability assay. Dose–
response curves were fitted and IC50 determined using a four-
parameter nonlinear fit model integrated into Prism 7 software
(GraphPad Software). Cell viability was monitored in real-time
using xCELLigence RTCA DP technology (Acea Biosciences). DLD or
SKOV3 cells were plated in 48-well E-plate at 12,000 cells/well.
Plates were incubated for 18 h, 37°C, 5% CO2, before cells were
either treated with BiTE (2 ng/ll) or infected with virus (100 vp/
cell) or left untreated. Two hours after infection, 75,000 CD3+ cells
were added to the necessary wells. Cell impedance was measured
every 15 min for a duration of up to 160 h. For ex vivo cytotoxicity
assays, unpurified cells from ascites or pleural effusion samples
were resuspended in ascites fluid and plated (1.5e5/well) in flat-
bottom 96-well plates. After incubation for the stated duration at
37°C, 5% CO2, supernatants were analysed by LDH assay or total
cells were harvested by cell-dissociation buffer, stained for CD3,
CD25 and EpCAM, and analysed by flow cytometry.
Viral genome replication and qPCR
The
ability
of
EnAd-CMV-EpCAMBiTE,
EnAd-SA-EpCAMBiTE,
EnAd-CMV-ControlBiTE, EnAd-SA-ControlBiTE or EnAd to replicate
their genomes was analysed by seeding DLD cells in 24-well plate
(150,000 cells/well) for 18 h, 37°C, 5% CO2, before infection with
100 vp/cell. Wells were harvested 24 and 72 h post-infection, and
DNA purified using PureLink genomic DNA mini kit (Invitrogen,
#K182001) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Total viral
genomes were quantified by qPCR against EnAd hexon using

Bright-field and fluorescence images were captured on a Zeiss
Axiovert 25 microscope. Time-lapse videos were obtained to
observe viral or T cell-mediated lysis of target cells by EnAd or
EnAd-CMV-EpCAMBiTE. Uninfected cells were used as a negative
control. NHDF cells were stained with CellTracker Orange CMTMR
Dye (Life Technologies, #C2927), and CD3+ cells were stained with
CellTrace Violet Cell Proliferation Kit (Life Technologies, #C34557)

The paper explained
Problem
Cancer is a major killer, and oncolytic viruses provide a promising
new approach that combines direct toxicity with the potential crea-
tion of an anticancer immune response.
Results
Here, we have armed an oncolytic adenovirus known as EnAdenotu-
cirev to express a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) molecule. The BiTE is
secreted from virus-infected tumour cells and activates T cells in the
tumour microenvironment to kill chosen target cells. In this case, we
targeted them to kill EpCAM-positive tumour cells. BiTEs, and virus-
encoded BiTEs, have a remarkable ability to activate a range of T cells
to become cytotoxic and can even activate tumour infiltrating
lymphocytes (in liquid biopsies form patients) to kill autologous
tumour cells.
Impact
‘Arming’ EnAdenotucirev with BiTEs provides an important means to
potentiate the anticancer activity of the virus without decreasing its
cancer selectivity. Engaging endogenous T cells to kill cancer cells
capitalises on the immune-provocative nature of virus infection and
allows the immigrant T cells to be used to kill cancer cells directly.
These agents are now ripe for assessment in human clinical trials.
