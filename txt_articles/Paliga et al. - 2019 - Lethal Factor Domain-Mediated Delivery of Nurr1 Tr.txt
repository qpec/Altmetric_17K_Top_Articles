Abstract
The orphan transcription factor nuclear receptor-related 1 protein (Nurr1, also known as NR4A2) plays a key role in embryonic
development and maintenance of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Nurr1 deficiency is associated
with Parkinson’s disease where dopaminergic neurons degenerate suggesting that counter-regulation of Nurr1 activity may have
therapeutic effects. Here, we bacterially expressed and isolated a human Nurr1 fusion protein containing a N-terminal cell
delivery domain derived from detoxified anthrax lethal factor followed by wild type ubiquitin with deubiquitinating enzyme
recognition site for intracellular cleavage. Addition of the Nurr1 fusion protein to dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells generated a
cleaved, cytosolic Nurr1-containing fragment which was associated with increased levels of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-
limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis. Promoter-activity assays confirmed that exposure of cells to full-length Nurr1 fusion
protein activated not only its cognate human tyrosine hydroxylase promoter but also the corresponding mouse sequence,
although at a reduced efficiency. Using 6-hydroxydopamine as a dopaminergic cell specific neurotoxin, we demonstrate that
full-length Nurr1 fusion protein promotes a concentration-dependent protection from this toxic insult. Altogether, the enhance-
ment of tyrosine hydroxylase in naïve dopaminergic cells and the protective effects in a cellular model of Parkinson’s disease
suggest that full-length Nurr1 fusion protein may contribute to the development of a novel concept of protein-based therapy.

Introduction
Nuclear receptor-related 1 protein (Nurr1, also known as
NR4A2) is a member of the NR4A superfamily of nuclear
receptor proteins including Nur77 (NR4A1) and Nor1
(NR4A3). Nurr1 has been shown to be involved in the
development and maintenance of adult dopaminergic neurons
in the midbrain. However, Nur77 and Nor1 have other func-
tions, such as the induction of apoptotic pathways [1–4].
Nurr1 is an orphan transcription factor that influences the
expression of several key proteins of dopaminergic (DA) neu-
rons, including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine trans-
porter (DAT), and vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT)
[5]. Furthermore, Nurr1 is involved in the regulation of a
complex network of pathways such as Pitx3 and Wnt/β-ca-
tenin, thereby influencing the neurogenesis of dopaminergic
cells [6, 7]. Altogether, the development, differentiation, and
survival of DA neurons depend on Nurr1 [5]. Although the
vast majority of Parkinson’s disease (PD) cases are sporadic,
about 10% of the cases are based on genetic factors including
mutations in about 18 genes [8]. The morbidity of DA neurons
of elderly PD patients might be explained by an age-
dependent decline in Nurr1 expression [9]. Consistently, over-
expression of Nurr1 mediates anti-inflammatory effects and
neuroprotection in PD models - in vitro and in vivo [10] -
and recent reviews emphasize the potential of using Nurr1 in
PD therapy [11]. Nurr1-based gene therapy has been

 successful in animals after injection of adeno-associated virus
encoding Nurr1/Foxa2, but unfortunately, critical questions
remain to be answered before viral vector-based delivery can
be applied to patients [12]. Application of drugs that activate
Nurr1 or enhance its expression level have been promising,
but questions of drug specificity of action have been put for-
ward [11, 13]. Here, we aim to contribute to the discussion of a
protein-based method of Nurr1 application with the option of
a reversible and tunable delivery of Nurr1.
In order to allow efficient nuclear delivery of extracellular
applied transcription factor Nurr1, we made use of the mech-
anism by which the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
anthracis causes the anthrax disease; its virulence is mediated
by the poly-γ-D-glutamic acid capsule and by the secreted
anthrax toxin (AT). The three proteins protective antigen
(PA, 83 kDa), lethal factor (LF, 90 kDa), and edema factor
(EF, 89 kDa) build up anthrax toxin (AT). Whereas each of
these three proteins is not individually toxic, lethality was
shown for the combinations of LF together with PA and EF
along with PA [14]. PA is required for enabling LF and EF to
enter the host cells. PA binds to one of the ubiquitously
expressed cell surface receptors tumor endothelial marker 8
(TEM8 or ANTRXR1) or capillary morphogenesis gene 2
(CMG2 or ANTRX2) [15]. Upon binding, PA becomes
cleaved by furin protease resulting in a 63 kDa protein that
oligomerizes into a ring-shaped heptamer or octamer forming
a channel which binds LF and EF. This complex is taken up by
clathrin-dependent endocytosis into endosomes [16]. The
intra-endosomal pH decrease leads to the insertion of the PA
oligomer into the endosomal membrane forming a pore [17].
Unfolded LF and EF can translocate through this pore driven
by the pH gradient and are released into the cytosol [18].
Finally, chaperones are needed for the refolding of LF and
EF [19].
In 1992, Arora et al. fused full-length LF with the ADP-
ribosylation domain of Pseudomonas exotoxin A as a cargo
and demonstrated its PA-dependent cellular uptake into mam-
malian cells [20]. The non-toxic N-terminal amino acids 1-
254 of LF (LFn) are sufficient for the cellular delivery of fused
proteins along with PA [21]. However, some studies report
delivery of LFn fusion proteins independent from PA and
more recently, it has been shown that PA-dependent and PA-
independent delivery of peptides may co-exist because stim-
ulation of CD4+ T-cells of the immune system by LFn fusion
proteins does not require, but is enhanced by, PA in vitro
[22–25].
In addition to Nurr1 and its cell delivery domain LFn, we
used ubiquitin and small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)
protein. SUMO can be attached to target proteins as post-
translational modification for diverse cellular processes
[26]. Furthermore, fusion proteins with SUMO are useful
for the heterologous protein expression because it may in-
crease the amount of the recombinant expressed protein and
may increase its solubility and enhance its stability [27]. To
ensure nuclear translocation of transcriptionally-active
Nurr1 after LFn-mediated delivery into the cytosol, we
wanted to achieve its proteolytic cleavage from the fusion
protein using suitable cytosolic proteases. Deubiquitinating
enzymes (DUBs) are cytosolic or endosome-associated
proteases that counteract ubiquitination by recognizing the
di-glycine motif at the C-terminus of ubiquitin and releas-
ing ubiquitin from proteins or from ubiquitin fusion pro-
teins [28].
In this study, we investigate the application of the non-toxic
N-terminal part of lethal factor from B. anthracis for cellular
delivery of Nurr1 as a fusion protein with SUMO and ubiqui-
tin. Following bacterial expression of this fusion protein, we
use a tyrosine hydroxylase promoter assay for quantifying the
biological activity of Nurr1 after cellular uptake into the hu-
man neuroblastoma line SH-SY5Y. Furthermore, we examine
in the presence or absence of PA the possible protective effects
of this Nurr1 fusion protein after treatment of human SH-
SY5Y cells with the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-
OHDA).
Materials and Methods
Construction and Purification of Nurr1 Fusion
Proteins and PA
The HS-LUNN1 fusion protein was constructed by combin-
ing the LFn open reading frame (ORF) from pET-15b-LFN
WT (a gift from John Collier, Addgene plasmid #11082,
Addgene, Teddington, UK), the ubiquitin ORF from pET-
15-ubiquitin WT [29] (a gift from Rachel Klevit, Addgene
plasmid #12647, Addgene), and the Nurr1 sequence from
pMX-HTNN into the Champion™ pET SUMO Expression
System (Fisher Scientific GmbH, Schwerte, Germany) via a
combination of traditional and infusion cloning
(CLONTECH, Takara Bio Europe SAS, Saint-Germain-en-
Laye, France). The main features of the Champion™ vector
system include an inducible T7 promoter, an N-terminal
hexahistidine tag for protein purification, multiple cloning
sites, and an internal SUMO sequence, which is believed to
increase solubility of hard to express proteins and can be
cleaved by SUMO protease to get untagged proteins. The
human Nurr1 coding sequence (accession number
NM_006186.2) in pMX-HTNN was codon optimized with
GeneOptimizer® (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) for
bacterial expression and was synthesized by GeneArt®
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). The fusion protein variants H-
LUNN1, HS-NN1, and H-N1 resulted from sequential dele-
tion mutation with Q5® Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New
England BioLabs, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) of the full-
length construct pET-HS-LUNN1. All constructs were
3394
Mol Neurobiol (2019) 56:3393–3403
 confirmed by DNA sequencing. Detailed primer sequences
are listed in Supplements (Supplement Tables 1 and 2). For
protein expression, the constructs were transformed into the
Escherichia coli (E. coli) strain Rosetta-gami™ 2 (DE3)
pLysS (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), grown in ter-
rific broth (TB) media at 37 °C until an optical density of
OD600 = 0.9–1.1 and expression was induced with 1 mM iso-
propyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, Fisher Scientific
GmbH). According to manufacturer’s protocol, cells were
lysed and the fusion proteins were purified from bacterial cell
extracts by metal chelation using nickel nitrilotriacetic acid
(Ni-NTA) beads (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The purified
Nurr1 fusion proteins have a predicted molecular mass of
≈ 118 kDa for HS-LUNN1, ≈ 107 kDa for H-LUNN1,
≈ 81 kDa for HS-NN1, and ≈ 67 kDa for H-NN1. The pro-
duction and purification of PAwere similarly accomplished by
using pET-22b-PA WT (a gift from John Collier, Addgene
Plasmid #11079, Addgene) in E. coli and metal chelation pu-
rification via C-terminal hexahistidine tag resulting in the ≈ 83
kDa sized protein. All proteins were dialyzed in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Sigma-Aldrich,
Steinheim, Germany) Amicon centrifugation tubes (Merck
Millipore) with a molecular weight cut-off of 30, 50, or
100 kDa according to protein size following manufacture’s
protocol.
Cell Culture
The human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y (CRL-2266)
was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC, Rockville, USA) and routinely grown at 37 °C in a
1:1 ratio of DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) and Ham’s F-12
(Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 2 mM glutamine
(Sigma-Aldrich), 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Merck-
Biochrom, Berlin, Germany), and 25 μg/ml penicillin/strep-
tomycin (Gibco, Fisher Scientific GmbH) in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2 in the air. Identical cell numbers were
seeded in 96-well, 24-well, or 6-well plates and grown to 70–
80% confluence depending on experimental needs.
Transfection was performed using ViaFect™ transfection
reagent (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). To verify transfec-
tion efficiency, pcDNA3-eGFP (a gift from Doug
Golenbock, Addgene plasmid #13031, Addgene) was co-
transfected, and eGFP fluorescence was observed via fluo-
rescence microscopy (not shown).
Luciferase Reporter Assay
Cells were co-transfected with firefly luciferase encoding re-
porter plasmids pGL3-B (promoterless vector, E1751,
Promega), pTHm-pGL3-B (mouse TH promoter), pTHh-
pGL3-B (human TH promoter), and the internal control plas-
mid pRL-TK (E2241, Promega,) expressing Renilla luciferase
(if not otherwise stated). Cells were incubated for 24 h with
transfection reagent, washed with phosphate buffer saline
(PBS), and subsequently treated with different concentra-
tions of fusion protein (0–10 μM) for additional 24 h. After
several washing steps, cells were lysed and luciferase sig-
nals were measured following manufacturer’s protocol
(Dual-Glo® luciferase assay system, Promega) with 1420
luminescence counter Victor® light (PerkinElmer LAS,
Rodgau, Germany).
Cell Viability Assay
Neurotoxicity assays with 6-hydroxydopamine (Sigma-
Aldrich) were carried out by quantifying luciferase signals
produced from substrate conversion of living cells with
RealTime-Glo™ MT cell viability assay (Promega) to deter-
mine cell viability after fusion protein and toxin treatment.
Cells were plated in equal cell numbers; and after incubation
with different concentrations of HS-LUNN1 ± PA (0–3 μM,
proteins in equimolar concentrations) for 24 h, cells were
washed three times with PBS and incubated with different
concentrations of 6-OHDA (0–200 μM) for 1 h at 37 °C
followed by the viability determination procedure mentioned
before. Signals were measured following manufacturer’s pro-
tocol with microplate reader CLARIOstar® (BMG Labtech,
Ortenberg, Germany).
Cell Counting
Alternatively, intoxicated cells were counted according to the
following protocol: 10,000 cells were seeded per well in a 96
well plate. The next day, different concentrations of HS-
LUNN1 ± PA (0–3 μM, proteins in equimolar concentrations)
were applied in quadruplicates including controls without any
protein. After 24 h, the cells were washed three times with
PBS, and different concentration of 6-OHDAwere applied for
1 h at 37 °C. After 24 h, the cells were fixed in PBS supple-
mented with 4% PFA and 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 15 min and
permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X 100 in PBS for 15 min at
room temperature. Staining was performed with 0.1 μg/ml
4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in PBS for 10 min at
room temperature. Finally, the cells were washed with PBS for
5 min three times and kept in PBS. Micrographs were taken
using a wide field fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX51,
Hamburg, Germany) at × 10 magnification. These images
were used for cell counting with the help of the software
ImageJ [30].
Western Blot Analysis
Recombinant proteins and whole-cell lysates were subjected
to SDS-PAGE (8–10%, Tris-HCl) and then blotted onto ni-
trocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare Life Sciences,
Mol Neurobiol (2019) 56:3393–3403
3395
 Freiburg, Germany). SH-SY5Y cells prepared for whole-cell
protein immunoblot detection were treated with 0.25%
Trypsin-EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich) PBS to detach cells and re-
move remaining protein before lysis. To preserve proteins
from degradation, we used the lysis protocol and the passive
lysis buffer included in the Dual-Glo® luciferase assay sys-
tem (Promega) mentioned before. After determination of
protein concentration, samples were mixed with Laemmli
buffer and heated for at least 5 min at 95 °C. Membranes
were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS, then incu-
bated for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with
primary antibody solution. Detailed antibody information is
listed in Supplements. The membranes were then washed
repeatedly and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-
conjugated (HRP) secondary antibody solution for 1 h or
with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated (AP) secondary anti-
body solution for 2 h at room temperature. Reactions were
developed using SuperSignal™ West Pico chemilumines-
cent substrate (Fisher Scientific GmbH) for HRP secondary
antibodies and visualized on X-ray film (GE Healthcare Life
Sciences, Freiburg, Germany) or with ChemiDoc™ XRS+
system (BIO-RAD) and with BCIP®/NBT liquid substrate
(Sigma-Aldrich) for AP secondary antibodies for direct
staining of the membrane.
Protein Concentration Estimation
Protein concentrations were determined by using DC™ pro-
tein assay (BIO-RAD) and colorimetric measurement per-
formed at 670 nm with absorbance microplate reader
Sunrise™ (Tecan Deutschland GmbH, Crailsheim,
Germany).
Scanning and Analysis of the Images
De-stained gels, X-ray films, and dried blots were scanned
using the SHARP MX-4141 N PS (Sharp electronics business
systems, Cologne, Germany) unless pictures were taken di-
rectly via the integrated camera of ChemiDoc™ XRS+ system
(BIO-RAD) mentioned before. All scans were performed in
professional mode at 600 dpi and in 16-bit grayscale. All
figures were created with the software Microsoft PowerPoint
2016 (Redmond, Washington, USA).
Statistics
Protein bands were analyzed using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda,
MD, USA) software. The dose response curve was created
using the software Prism version 7.04 for Windows
(GraphRad, San Diego, CA, USA). Data are shown as mean
± standard error of mean (SEM). Statistical significance was
determined using the t test analysis normalized to untreated
cells. Experiments were replicated at least three times; p
values under 0.05 were considered significant.
Results
Fragments of Full-Length Nurr1 Fusion Protein Are
Delivered into SH-SY5Y Cells
Previously, Bachran et al. [31] established a fusion protein
consisting of LFn, followed by ubiquitin and fused to protein
of interest, the Pseudomonas exotoxin A catalytic domain
(PEIII). Here, we added N-terminal SUMO to this system
and introduced a nuclear localization signal (NLS) to the
Nurr1 protein (Fig. 1a). We used SUMO in order to increase
the solubility of the fusion protein during expression as de-
scribed elsewhere [27]. Ubiquitin was fused with a GGG-
linker to NLS-Nurr1 with the intention that after cellular
uptake of HS-LUNN1, intracellular DUBs would cut HS-
LUNN1 into two fragments, one composed of SUMO,
LFn, and ubiquitin, as well as a second fragment consisting
of NLS-Nurr1, which would enter the nucleus. Altogether,
the fusion protein HS-LUNN1 (predicted molecular weight,
118 kDa) consists of six functional domains as described in
Fig. 1a.
After purification of bacterially expressed HS-LUNN1
(Fig. S1), the protein was added to cultured SH-SY5Y cells
at various concentrations ranging between 0.1 and 3 μM for
18–24 h. Because of the contrasting cellular effects of Nurr1
and Nur77 respectively, we used antibodies detecting both
Nurr1 and Nur77 at the same time. We observed a HS-
LUNN1 concentration-dependent 9.1-fold increase (related
to endogenous Nurr1, Figs. 1c, and 3 μM HS-LUNN1) of
the Nurr1-containing fragment (NN1, 67.4 kDa) (Fig. 1b, up-
per band in upper panel). Interestingly, the endogenous Nur77
protein levels (64 kDa, Fig. 1b, lower band) decreased in-
versely to added HS-LUNN1 concentrations (4.8-fold 3-μM
HS-LUNN1). The identities of the bands for Nurr1 or Nur77,
respectively, were confirmed by Western blots using specific
antibodies (data not shown).
In order to analyze N-terminal DUB intracellular cleavage
products complementary to the above described C-terminal
Nurr1-containing fragment, we used antibodies against LF.
We found a HS-LUNN1 concentration-dependent increase
of the LFn-containing HS-LU-fragment (Fig. 1d, supplement
Fig. S3a, right panel). Note that the predicted size of HS-LU is
52 kDa but runs at a higher MW position in the gel which
could be due to the previously described shift of the SUMO
domain [32]. As a next step, we investigated well-described
Nurr1 downstream effectors and found that TH protein levels
were increased by HS-LUNN1 again in a concentration-
dependent manner (Fig. 1d) [5].

 HS-LUNN1 Increases Levels of TH Protein
and Activated Mouse and Human Tyrosine
Hydroxylase Promoter Sequences
In order to investigate possible downstream effects emerging
from delivered Nurr1 protein, we at first analyzed levels of TH
protein in SH-SY5Y cells. There was a HS-LUNN1 concen-
tration-dependent increase of TH protein detected by Western
blotting (Fig. 1d). Next, we used a luciferase-based promoter
assay [33] to directly test possible transcriptional activity by
HS-LUNN1 after cellular delivery. The luciferase assay
showed strong activation of mouse (pTHm) and human
(pTHh) TH promoters (e.g., 1-μM HS-LUNN1; pTHm 4.4
± 0.2; pTHh 14.5 ± 0.8). However, the human TH promoter is
about threefold more strongly activated as compared to the
mouse (Fig. 2). Moreover, saturation in luciferase activity
was achieved already at concentrations at 1 μM of HS-
LUNN1. Following the major difference in activation
between the mouse and human TH promoter sequence by
HS-LUNN1, we focused on the human TH promoter in all
subsequent experiments. Performing a detailed dose response
curve revealed that the lowest amount to activate the human
TH promoter in the presence or absence of PAwas in the range
of 0.1–0.3 nM of HS-LUNN1 (see Fig. S2).
HS-LUNN1 Protects SH-SY5Y Cells from 6-OHDA
Intoxication
The neurotoxin 6-OHDA imposes stress to dopaminergic and
noradrenergic cells by generating reactive oxygen species
resulting in cellular degeneration [34]. To further investigate
possible effects of HS-LUNN1 on 6-OHDA-induced stress,
we first incubated SH-SY5Y cells with various concentrations
of HS-LUNN1 for 24 h in the presence or absence of PA. Cells
were then challenged with various concentrations of 6-OHDA
(50 μM, 100 μM, and 200 μM) for 1 h at 37 °C and washed

Each lane contained 2 μg of whole-cell protein. The positions of
molecular mass markers are shown to the left of the gels, and anti-β-

 three times with PBS afterwards. The cell viability was deter-
mined by substrate conversion of living cells producing a
luminescence signal, which is proportional to cell number
(see the BMaterials and Methods^ section). The cell viability
of untreated controls (without protein and without toxin) were
defined and plotted as zero in graphs to highlight changes
under the various experimental conditions. We observed a
concentration-dependent enhancement of cell viability in
HS-LUNN1 (± PA)-treated cells at all 6-OHDA concentra-
tions applied (Fig. 3). Please note that even at 200 μM 6-
OHDA (the highest toxin concentration tested), the protective
effect of 3 μM HS-LUNN1 fusion protein was still very pro-
nounced. These data strongly suggest a protective effect of
HS-LUNN1 on SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, there was a
minor but significant enhancement on this protective effect
by PA at the following experimental conditions: 1 μM HS-
LUNN1 using 100 μM 6-OHDA or 200 μM 6-OHDA or at 3
μM HS-LUNN1 using 50 μM 6-OHDA (Fig. 3).
In this context of neurotoxin treatments, we found an increase
in cell viability when cells were incubated with HS-LUNN1 (±
PA) without 6-OHDA treatment for 24 h, as confirmed by
counting non-fragmented DAPI-positive cell nuclei (66.9 ±
17.0% 3-μM HS-LUNN1; 45.4 ± 9.0% HS-LUNN1 + PA).
Domain Composition of Nurr1 Fusion Proteins
Influences the Efficiency of Transcriptional Activation
of Tyrosine Hydroxylase Promoter
In order to investigate the possible contribution of the various
domains in HS-LUNN1 for the transcriptional activation after
cytosolic delivery, we prepared N-terminal His-tagged but
truncated variants of full-length HS-LUNN1. H-LUNN1
(without SUMO domain) or HS-NN1 (without LFn and with-
out ubiquitin) and H-N1 containing the Nurr1 protein without
NLS (Fig. S3) were analyzed for their activity of activating
TH promoter (Fig. 4a). We observed that the full-length HS-
LUNN1 protein showed the highest efficiency in activating
the TH promoter region compared to the two other variants
(Fig. 4b). Notably, proteins lacking SUMO or LFn-ubiquitin,
respectively (H-LUNN1 and HS-NN1), were each still able to
activate the TH promoter, although to a much lower efficiency
as compared to HS-LUNN1 full-length protein. The H-N1
protein (Nurr1 only) showed some basal but not significant
levels of luciferase activation compared to the controls.
Discussion
In this study, we report the bacterial expression of human
Nurr1 as a fusion protein composed of SUMO, ubiquitin as
well as LFn for the cellular uptake. After exposure of HS-
LUNN1 protein to human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells, it
became intracellularly cleaved by DUBs resulting in increased
TH expression. TH promoter assay confirmed the transcrip-
tional activity of the delivered Nurr1 protein. Furthermore,
HS-LUNN1 protein strongly protected SH-SY5Y cells from
6-OHDA-induced cell death.
Current therapies for treating PD cannot restore dopaminer-
gic neurons or stop their degeneration. Drug therapies are based
on providing the dopamine precursor levodopa or on applica-
tion of several inhibitors influencing the dopamine level [35].
As for surgical treatments, electrodes can be implanted for

er) and pTHh-pGl3B (human TH promoter) 24 h prior to protein incuba-
tion with HS-LUNN1. The Renilla luciferase expression plasmid, pRL-
TK, and the original pGL3B (promoterless) control were utilized as an
internal and external standard, respectively. Data are from two
independent experiments, each of which was conducted in triplicate and
expressed as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM) for control cells
(untreated cells only transfected with pTHh-pGl3B and pRL-TK). The

 deep brain stimulation into the subthalamic nuclei, thalamus, or
globus pallidus interna, thereby reducing the motor symptoms
[36, 37], yet side effects cannot be excluded. Dopaminergic cell
transplantation offers a future therapeutic option regarding PD,
which is currently under investigation in animal models [38]. In
this context, Nurr1 is used in combination with at least one
additional transcription factor for restoring DA phenotypes in
induced neurons [39, 40]. Caiazzo et al. showed that mouse and
human fibroblast can be reprogrammed to functional induced
dopaminergic neurons by applying the minimal set of the three
transcription factors Mash1, Lmx1a, and Nurr1 [41]. More re-
cently, overexpression of Nurr1 and Foxa2 transcription factors
were shown to yield mature midbrain dopamine neurons from
induced neural precursor cells [42].
The mentioned approaches are important steps towards the
development of patient-derived induced dopaminergic neu-
rons in cell replacement therapy for treating PD. However,
this concept cannot be converted into a therapy as yet, because
viral vectors (such as lentiviruses) carry an inherent risk for off
target effects and immunogenicity [43]. A more promising
approach could arise from the application of transcription fac-
tors via cellular delivery of the protein. As previously shown
by Nagel et al., mesencephalic DA neurons could be protected
from degeneration in several models of PD using
transactivator of transcription (TAT)-mediated protein trans-
duction of heat-shock protein 70 (TAT-Hsp70) [44].
Furthermore, reprogramming of human fibroblasts into in-
duced dopaminergic neurons has been achieved by applying
TAT-mediated Sox2 and Lmx1a along with small molecules
[45]. In addition, proteins fused to cell-penetrating peptide
(CPP) or protein transduction domains (PTDs) [46] or to bac-
terial toxins [47] were developed. As application of bacterial
toxins, mainly three different systems were used for cellular
protein delivery, namely, diphtheria toxin, anthrax toxin, and
Pseudomonas exotoxin. Several toxic proteins fused to
anthrax-derived LFn were investigated as therapeutic tools
for killing tumor cells [31, 48, 49]. Here, we decided to use
LFn for the cellular delivery, supported by the observation that
proteins fused to a bacterial toxin show a higher cytosolic
delivery than CPPs [50].
In our study, Western blot analysis of total protein extrac-
tions from HS-LUNN1-treated SH-SY5Y cells showed cellu-
lar uptake and intracellular cleavage of HS-LUNN1 (Fig. 1b–
d). Thus, we observed an increase of delivered Nurr1 fusion
protein corresponding to the increasing concentrations of ex-
tracellular applied HS-LUNN1. This concentration-dependent
increase in Nurr1 was associated with a corresponding 4.8-
fold decline of endogenous Nur77 levels which is in partial
agreement of data from Eelles et al. 2012, describing that
haloperidol-induced upregulation of Nur77 and Nor1 was
coupled to a reduction of Nurr1 [51]. Treatment with 6-
OHDA in SH-SY5Y cells leads to the upregulation, phosphor-
ylation, and translocation of Nur77 form the nucleus to the
mitochondria [52]. In contrast, knockdown of Nur77 reduces
6-OHDA-induced cell death, at least in PC12 cells [53],
confirming a contra-directional coupling between Nur77 and
Nurr1 [4]. A number of publications have shown the protec-
tive mechanisms of Nurr1 achieved by regulating mitochon-
drial genes such as superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), mito-
chondrial translation elongation factor, or cyclooxygenase 5ß
[4, 54]. The possible role played by the decreased pro-
apoptotic Nur77 activity shown here (Fig. 1b) needs still to
be investigated.
We observe here that exposure to HS-LUNN1 led to an
increase in TH protein levels (Fig. 1d), which is a well-
described downstream target of Nurr1 transcription factor
[5]. In order to test if elevated TH levels resulted from
Fig. 3 Effects of HS-LUNN1 protein treatment (± PA) on cell viability.
SH-SY5Y cells were incubated for 24 h with HS-LUNN1 (± PA)
followed by treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) for 1 h.
Cell viability was quantified by RealTime-GloTM MT cell viability
assay (Promega). Luminescence signal of untreated cells (without
protein and without toxin) was utilized as an internal standard and
defined as zero to highlight deviations. Data are from six independent
experiments, each of which was conducted in four replicates. Error bars

 enhanced promoter activity, we used our previously described
luciferase reporter assay of murine and human TH promoters
[33]. The three tested concentrations of HS-LUNN1 showed
similar activation rates for both promoters, but the human
promoter showed a threefold stronger activation than the
mouse promoter (Fig. 2).
As a working hypothesis, we propose that there is a cyto-
solic delivery of HS-LUNN1 (i) by cellular uptake through the
plasma membrane, (ii) by release or escape from endosomes,
or (iii) by direct LFn-mediated transmembrane delivery mech-
anism allowing Nurr1 to activate the TH promoter in the cell
nucleus [55].
In accordance with other studies showing that the overex-
pression of Nurr1 leads to neuroprotection [10, 56], we asked
whether HS-LUNN1 can exert similar cellular effects.
Therefore, we treated SH-SY5Y cells with different concen-
trations of HS-LUNN1 in the presence or absence of PA and
applied a neurotoxic stimulus by 6-OHDA (Fig. 3). While
toxic 6-OHDA concentration showed the expected decrease
in cell viability of SH-SY5Y cells, increasing concentrations
of HS-LUNN1 could counteract this toxic effect and could
even increase cell viability of untreated cells. This clearly
underlines that exogenous applied HS-LUNN1 fusion protein
is capable to promote neuroprotection.
In a previous study, we demonstrated that transgenic acti-
vation of Ras activity in neurons led to increased Nurr1-
expression resulting in survival and differentiation of
neurospheres into a dopaminergic cell fate [33]. All this un-
derlines the important role of Nurr1 in enhancing and stabiliz-
ing DA properties in perspective for the development of cell
replacement therapies.
While in general the application of PA is needed for LFn-
mediated cellular uptake, we found only minor effects when
PA together with HS-LUNN1 was applied prior to the 6-
OHDA treatment (Fig. 3). All other experiments on HS-
LUNN1 delivery in this study were carried out in absence of
PA. Such a PA-independent delivery is however in line to
studies demonstrating that PA is not necessarily required for

In addition to full-length HS-LUNN1 (Fig. 1a), variant Nurr1 fusion proteins
were created as follows: without the SUMO domain (H-LUNN1), without
the LFn(254) and ubiquitin domain (HS-NN1), and with the hexahistidine tag
fused to Nurr1 only (H-N1). b Luciferase reporter assay in SH-SY5Y cells

inal pGL3B control were utilized as an internal and external standard, re-
spectively. Data are obtained from three independent experiments, each of
which was conducted in triplicate, and are means ± SEM for untreated cells

 LFn-mediated cellular delivery of LFn fusion proteins when
these are administered at concentrations > 1 μM [23–25].
Accordingly, Cao et al. suggested that the cellular uptake of
LFn fusion proteins can take place in absence of PA via an-
other mechanism involving the major histocompatibility com-
plex (MHC) class I pathway [22]. Here, the minor effect of PA
might be explained that PA-dependent and independent cellu-
lar uptake mechanisms may occur in parallel. PA-dependent
uptake may be more evident when PA and LFn are present at
low concentrations corresponding to the receptor affinity of
approximately 1 nM [57, 58].
Finally, we analyzed N-terminally His-tagged but truncated
bacterially expressed variants of full-length HS-LUNN1. H-
LUNN1 (without SUMO domain) or HS-NN1 (without LFn
and without ubiquitin) and H-N1 containing the Nurr1 protein
without NLS were analyzed for their capacity of activating TH
promoter (Fig. 4a). Again, the TH promoter-activity assay in
SH-SY5Y cells was used to address the question of the differ-
ential contribution of the various domains to functional nucle-
ar delivery. At all concentrations of the protein fragments test-
ed, HS-LUNN1 showed the highest activation rate, meaning
that all domains of the fusion protein were contributing to
enhance transcriptional activity. Interestingly, H-N1 alone
(containing His-tagged Nurr1 only) was not sufficient to in-
duce a concentration-dependent increase in luciferase activity
suggesting that an endosomal/lysosomal mechanism of deliv-
ering extracellular His-tagged Nurr1 to the cytoplasm via
leaky endosomal membrane compartments is unlikely [59].
Nurr1 contains an endogenous bipartite nuclear localization
sequence [60], indicating that it has the capacity to enter the
nucleus without additional NLS once delivered to the cytosol.
Omitting the SUMO domain reduced the transcriptional activ-
ity by up to 50% at various concentrations of HS-LUNN1,
suggesting that SUMO contributes to the efficiency of func-
tional nuclear delivery. This is also supported by data obtained
from the HS-NN1 protein showing that SUMO alone results
in some functional delivery of NLS-Nurr1 without LFn do-
main. We cannot exclude here that the external N-terminal
NLS plays a role in cellular delivery nor do we know if the
possible effect of SUMO is due to its previously described ion
channel activation or due to its capacity to enhance receptor-
mediated internalization, nuclear localization, or any other
effect [61]. Altogether, these results suggest that all the do-
mains used contribute to the efficiency of functional nuclear
transfer of Nurr1 transcription factor.
Taken together, human Nurr1 was fused to SUMO, ubiq-
uitin, and the non-toxic N terminus of LFn for functional
nuclear delivery, which was shown in the human dopaminer-
gic cell line SH-SY5Y. TH promoter assays confirmed the
transcriptional activity of full-length Nurr1 fusion protein
HS-LUNN1. Finally, applying HS-LUNN1 to human SH-
SY5Y cells led to a protection from neurotoxin 6-OHDA-
induced cellular degeneration. These findings may have
relevance for the nuclear delivery of Nurr1 transcription factor
in the context of protein-based treatments in Parkinson’s
disease.
