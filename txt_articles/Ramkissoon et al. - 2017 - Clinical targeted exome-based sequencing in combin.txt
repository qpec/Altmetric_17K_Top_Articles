Abstract
Background. Clinical genomics platforms are needed to identify targetable alterations, but implementation of 
these technologies and best practices in routine clinical pediatric oncology practice are not yet well established.
Methods. Profile is an institution-wide prospective clinical research initiative that uses targeted sequencing to iden-
tify targetable alterations in tumors. OncoPanel, a multiplexed targeted exome-sequencing platform that includes 
300 cancer-causing genes, was used to assess single nucleotide variants and rearrangements/indels. Alterations 
were annotated (Tiers 1–4) based on clinical significance, with Tier 1 alterations having well-established clinical 
utility. OncoCopy, a clinical genome-wide array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) assay, was also per-
formed to evaluate copy number alterations and better define rearrangement breakpoints.
Results. Cancer genomes of 203 pediatric brain tumors were profiled across histological subtypes, including 117 
samples analyzed by OncoPanel, 146 by OncoCopy, and 60 tumors subjected to both methodologies. OncoPanel 
revealed clinically relevant alterations in 56% of patients (44 cancer mutations and 20 rearrangements), including 
BRAF alterations that directed the use of targeted inhibitors. Rearrangements in MYB-QKI, MYBL1, BRAF, and 
FGFR1 were also detected. Furthermore, while copy number profiles differed across histologies, the combined use 
of OncoPanel and OncoCopy identified subgroup-specific alterations in 89% (17/19) of medulloblastomas.
Conclusion. The combination of OncoPanel and OncoCopy multiplex genomic assays can identify critical diag-
nostic, prognostic, and treatment-relevant alterations and represents an effective precision medicine approach for 
clinical evaluation of pediatric brain tumors.

Importance of the study
Clinically validated genomics platforms are required 
for the implementation of precision medicine, 
including in pediatric neuro-oncology. In this study, 
we demonstrate the utility of a targeted exome-
sequencing platform in combination with genome-
wide copy number profiling using aCGH in a clinical 
setting. These platforms detected clinically relevant 
alterations in 55% of all patients, including identifica-
tion of driver genomic mutations. In addition, we iden-
tified alterations that confer diagnostic and prognostic 
significance, such as those that allow subtyping of 
medulloblastoma. Our results indicate that genomic 
profiling of pediatric brain tumors is feasible and clini-
cally useful.
Over the last 30 years, childhood mortality from cancer 
has declined significantly across most cancer types, with 
an average decrease of more than 50%. By contrast, how-
ever, pediatric brain cancers have demonstrated only a 
30% decrease in mortality, thus highlighting the pressing 
clinical necessity to improve diagnostics and disease man-
agement. Furthermore, from 2008 to 2012, brain tumors 
accounted for 25% of all pediatric cancer deaths.1 Although 
mortality has decreased, many patients suffer long-lasting 
and debilitating morbidities as a result of aggressive surgi-
cal resection and high doses of radiation therapy and cyto-
toxic chemotherapy.2
Across a variety of cancer types, the identification of sub-
type-specific mutations has often represented a critical ini-
tiating step in the path toward targeted therapies.3,4 Recent 
work in pediatric brain tumors has demonstrated key dif-
ferences between these tumors compared with adult coun-
terparts. Tumors from both these cohorts show not only 
different incidence rates across their respective popula-
tions, but substantial variation in identified driver events.5–8
In order to translate these advances into clinical practice, 
physicians require a means by which to obtain accurate 
clinically relevant genomic data for these tumors. Patients 
require that this type of testing be affordable and widely 
accessible. Implementation of such platforms has been 
well described in the adult neuro-oncology population.9–12 
Herein, we report our experience of performing genomic 
profiling of pediatric neuro-oncology patients using a tar-
geted exome approach in conjunction with genome-wide 
copy number analysis in a setting certified by the Clinical 
Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA).
Methods
Ethics Statement
Ethics approval was granted by the human institutional 
review board committees of the Dana-Farber/Harvard 
Cancer Center. Informed consent was obtained from all 
patients and/or their guardians. Targeted exome sequenc-
ing was performed on tumors from patients enrolled on 
the Profile clinical study.
Clinical Data and Review of Histology
Clinical data were extracted from clinical charts and de-
identified. A histological diagnosis for each patient was 
rendered for the study by at least one pediatric neuro-
pathologist for all cases (S.H.R.) and most cases were 
reviewed by a second neuropathologist.
Clinical Array Comparative Genomic 
Hybridization
High resolution array comparative genomic hybridization 
(aCGH) (Agilent Sure Print G3 Human 1 × 1M feature array) 
was performed on clinical biopsy samples from formalin-
fixed paraffin embedded material in a CLIA-certified labora-
tory as part of clinical care using a methodology previously 
described.13,14 Two micrograms of patient and reference 
DNA (Promega) were fragmented and hybridized to each 
microarray. The average resolution of the aCGH platform 
across Reference Sequence genes is 1.8 kb, and across the 
genome 2.1 kb.
Analysis was performed as previously described14 and 
clinical reports were generated by teams of board-certified 
clinical cytogeneticists, neuropathologists, and molecular 
pathologists.
Targeted Next-Generation 
Sequencing—OncoPanel
For patients enrolled on the Profile clinical trial, detec-
tion of mutations and gene rearrangements in tumors 
was achieved using targeted next-generation sequencing 
(OncoPanel).15,16 This assay (Agilent SureSelect for target 
capture and Illumina HiSeq sequencing) surveys exonic 
DNA sequences of 300 cancer genes, including 91 introns 
across 30 genes (Supplementary 
Table 1) for mutation and 
rearrangement detection in tumor-derived DNA (minimum 
50 ng, formalin-fixed paraffin embedded–derived tissue). 
Neuropathologists review each tumor specimen and esti-
mate the number of neoplastic cells in the submitted sam-
ple (tumor purity). OncoPanel results were interpreted and 
reported by molecular pathologists, and alterations were

Ramkissoon et al. An integrative genomic analysis of 203 pediatric brain tumors 
classified into 4 tiers (Tier 1 to 
Tier 4) to provide therapeu-
tic and prognostic significance16 (Supplementary Table 1), 
with Tier 1 alterations having well-established published 
evidence confirming clinical utility. BreaKmer, an algo-
rithm that predicts insertions, deletions, tandem duplica-
tions, and gene rearrangements, was implemented in April 
2014 and detected aberrations in 70/120 (58%) patients.17
Whole-Genome Sequencing
Tumor and normal control were sequenced at the Broad 
Institute of MIT and Harvard. DNA was randomly frag-
mented, and libraries prepared for paired-end sequenc-
ing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000. Read pairs were aligned 
to reference genome hg19 (Build 37) using the Burrows-
Wheeler Aligner with options −q 5 −l 32 −k 2 −o 1.18 Reads 
were sorted by coordinates, normalized, and cleaned 
and duplicates were marked using SAMtools and Picard. 
Base quality score assignments were recalibrated to 
control for biases due to flow cell, lane, dinucleotide 
context, and machine cycle using the Genome Analysis 
Toolkit.19 Rearrangements were detected using Snowman, 
an assembly-based method (Wala et al, manuscript in 
preparation).
Exploratory Analysis of Copy Number Profiles
Copy number profiles can be inferred from OncoPanel 
profiling; however, the resolution of genome-wide aCGH 
is higher. Copy number profiles presented here were gen-
erated from aCGH analysis. A circular binary segmenta-
tion algorithm was used to segment copy number data 
for research purposes using parameters (α = 0.01, undo.
splits = none, minimum width = 5). Focal versus broad 
somatic copy number alteration events were defined with a 
cutoff of 0.5× chromosome arm length and gene confidence 
level of 0.99. Segmented data were visually presented using 
Integrative Genomics Viewer 2.320 in heatmap format.
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of arm-level copy 
number profiles was performed in GenePattern,21 using 
Euclidean distance as the column distance measurement 
and pairwise complete-linkage as the clustering method. 
Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering was 
performed in GenePattern, with 20 clusterings per K and 
divergence error function.
Support vector machine (SVM) multiclass analysis was 
performed within MatLab, using the fitcecoc module, and a 
one-versus-one coding design. Tumors were assigned one 
of the following labels: glial, embryonal, meningiomas, or 
not otherwise specified (NOS). 
The model was trained with 
136 of the 146 samples; the remaining 10 samples were then 
used to assess the model’s ability to predict classes. This 
method was repeated 15 times, leaving out a different set of 
10 samples each time so that the accuracy of the model was 
tested using every sample within the aCGH cohort.
Medulloblastoma Subtyping
DNA-based molecular subtyping was performed for 
medulloblastoma samples through analysis of the 
molecular aberrations (including both single nucleotide 
variants and copy number aberrations) identified through 
microarray and sequencing studies. Previously reported 
findings in large cohort series22–24 were used to guide sub-
typing according to criteria in Supplementary Table 4. For 
example, the Wingless (WNT) subgroup tumors were iden-
tified by monosomy 6 and/or CTNNB1 mutations. Sonic 
hedgehog (SHH)–activated tumors were categorized by 
the presence of at least one of the following: (i) any direct 
alteration in genes involved in SHH signaling, including 
PTCH1, SMO, SUFU, GLI1, GLI2, or (ii) more than one of 
the following: 9q deletion, which includes PTCH1 single 
copy loss, the co-occurrence of chromothripsis, and TP53 
mutations. Group 3 tumors were classified by the presence 
of MYC amplification in the absence of isodicentric chro-
mosome 17
. Group 4 tumors were identified by the pres-
ence of isodicentric chromosome 17p11.2. Group 3/4 was 
assigned if tumors lacked diagnostic Group 3, 4, or WNT/
SHH features or contained Groups 3 and 4 features in the 
same tumor.
Statistical Analysis
Unpaired 2-sided t-tests were used to determine differ-
ences in percentage of genome afflicted by genomic dis-
ruption across subtypes. P-values of <.05 were deemed to 
be significant.
Results
Assay Overview
Our institutions implemented a precision medicine pro-
gram for pediatric patients with brain tumors that included 
next-generation sequencing and copy number profiling. 
The goals of this testing included determining diagno-
sis, clarifying prognoses, and identifying possible action-
able molecular changes that could be used for assigning 
patients to clinical trials. For the purposes of this study we 
analyzed the OncoPanel data for single nucleotide varia-
tions (SNVs), insertions/deletions (indels), and rearrange-
ments only and analyzed the OncoCopy (aCGH) data for 
copy number changes.
Cohort Demographics and Sample Characteristics
Between January 2013 and June 2015, OncoPanel testing 
was requested on 142 pediatric brain tumor specimens. 
All histological subtypes of pediatric brain tumors were 
represented (Supplementary Table 2). The median age 
of children enrolled was 8 years and the range 0.15 to 
25.5 years. At the time of our data analysis, clinical reports 
were generated for 120 patients (82% of requested); 3 
specimens could not be evaluated because of technical 
limitations of the material submitted (2.5%). In addition, 
aCGH copy number testing was requested and reporting 
completed on 146 pediatric brain tumor specimens. Data 
from both assays were available for 60 patients during 
this time frame.

The mean reported tumor purity of samples profiled by 
OncoPanel was 70% (range 20%–95%), the mean cover-
age was 181× (range 75–634), and the mean percentage 
of exons with greater than 30 reads across the cohort was 
96% (range 91%–99%).
Copy Number Profiles Are Predictive of Histology 
in Pediatric Brain Tumors
Embryonal tumors (medulloblastomas, primitive neuroe-
ctodermal tumors [PNETs], and atypical teratoid rhabdoid 
tumors [AT/RTs]) are known to exhibit distinct copy num-
ber profiles compared with glial tumors (gliomas, epend-
ymomas, astrocytomas, and glioblastomas) and to carry 
specific diagnostic or prognostic implications.25
To determine the degree to which the profiles from the 
clinical aCGH assay differed across histological subtypes, 
we performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering of 
genome-wide copy number profiles of 146 pediatric brain 
tumors (Fig. 1A). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering 
revealed the tumors to separate into 2 dominant clusters 
of tumors, each with at least 2 further subclusters within 
each branch (Fig. 1A). Embryonal tumors were the most 
common tumor in cluster 1 (18 of 39 tumors, 46%) with 
high-grade gliomas (HGGs) being the next most frequent 
(11 of 39, 28%). Cluster 2 was enriched with glial tumors 
(76 of 107
, 71%). Pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) clus-
tered separately to HGGs, with PLGGs tending to cluster 
in Group 2A (20 of 28 gliomas, 71%) and HGGs clustering 
with embryonal tumors in Group 1 and Group 2B. WNT
-
positive medulloblastomas segregated into cluster 2B 
while meningiomas clustered with glial tumors in cluster 
2. The 2 choroid plexus carcinomas clustered together with 
the embryonal tumors in cluster 2B. An independent analy-
sis with NMF clustering suggested at least 8 copy number 
clusters.
To a large degree, these results were due to differing bur-
dens of genomic alterations. In embryonal tumors, 26% of 
the genome was affected by arm-level copy number altera-
tions, a significant increase compared with the frequency 
observed in glial tumors (10%). HGGs exhibited greater 
genomic disruption than LGGs (Fig. 1B). Indeed, 37 tumors 
had no discernible copy number alterations. Comparative 
marker selection revealed 13 arm-level events that were 
significantly different between glial and embryonal tumors 
(q < 0.25) (Supplementary Table 3); of these 10p, 17q, 
7q, 19p, 19q, and 5p were the most differentially altered 
(q < 0.05).
We sought to harness a machine-learning algorithm (ie, 
SVMs) to quantify further how well copy number profiles 
could differentiate between the 5 histological subgroups

Ramkissoon et al. An integrative genomic analysis of 203 pediatric brain tumors 
(glioma, embryonal tumor, meningioma, choroid plexus 
carcinoma, and NOS). We anticipated that there would 
be significant error due to the limited number of tumors 
in some subgroups and significant levels of heterogeneity 
within these broadly defined subgroups. However, there 
was interest in using this large cross-cancer dataset to 
explore the extent to which lineage identification by copy 
number might be possible. We trained an SVM classifier on 
136 tumors spanning these subgroups. 
The in-sample clas-
sification error was 15%; glial tumors were predicted as 
glial in 88% of instances and embryonal tumors as embry-
onal in 50% of instances. 
The remaining 50% of embryonal 
tumors were classified as glial (Fig. 1C). Cross-validation of 
the classification using 10-fold validation revealed an out-
of-sample classification error of 33%. By contrast, random 
histological assignment revealed an out-of-sample clas-
sification error of 86%. SVM classification was unable to 
accurately distinguish HGGs from LGGs, classifying 58% of 
HGGs as LGGs and 26% as embryonal tumors.
Recurrent Activating Mutations and Genomic 
Rearrangements Are Detected by Targeted 
Exome Sequencing
OncoPanel data obtained from 117 brain tumors were 
analyzed to assess for both gene mutations and rear-
rangements. As part of the clinical reporting workflow, 
variants were included in reports based on the presence 
of both >5 variant reads and an allelic fraction greater than 
1%. OncoPanel does not include matched normal DNA 
controls. Thus, private germline alterations could not be 
excluded and were often reported as Tier 4 variants, rep-
resenting SNVs not previously reported to be pathogenic 
in cancer.
Excluding 2 glioblastoma (GBM) patients with a hyper-
mutator phenotype, a mean of 4 SNVs (range 1–13) were 
detected in each patient. OncoPanel revealed clinically 
relevant alterations in 56% of patients (64/115). Across 
the 115 OncoPanel patients (excluding the 2 GBM patients 
with a hypermutator phenotype), 44 (38%) were found to 
have 
Tiers 1–3 mutations (42 of these patients had 
Tier 1 or 
Tier 2 mutations) and an additional 20 (17%) were found 
to have clinically actionable rearrangements. The remain-
ing patients were observed to harbor 
Tier 4 alterations (Fig. 
2A); this was the most frequent tier of alteration detected 
across the entire cohort (Fig. 2B).
Mutations were observed in a number of genes of direct 
relevance to pediatric brain tumor diagnosis and treat-
ment, including BRAF
, FGFR1, NTRK1, ATRX, TP53, and 
IDH1 in glial tumors, and CTNNB1 and PTCH1 mutations 
in medulloblastoma (Fig. 2D). We also observed driver 
mutations previously reported: KIT in germinoma,26 VHL 
mutations in hemangioblastomas27; and the single case 
of primary CNS melanoma in association with neurocuta-
neous melanocytosis was driven by a mutation of NRAS 
(p.Q61K) as previously described.28
The identification of alterations for which small molecule 
inhibitors exist influenced clinical management of the 
patients. Across the entire cohort of patients profiled with 
OncoPanel, 37 had tumors with an alteration for which a 
small molecule inhibitor is in early phase clinical investi-
gation (Supplementary Table 2). Of these 37 patients, 8 
children (22%) were treated with a targeted small molecule 
inhibitor based on the mutation identified by OncoPanel, 
and more patients are likely to be treated in the future 
upon tumor progression.
OncoPanel Detects Clinically Relevant 
Rearrangements
OncoPanel detected rearrangements in 25 of 115 pediatric 
brain tumors analyzed and reported for rearrangements. 
These included rearrangements involving BRAF, FGFR1-
TACC1, and MYB family members previously reported 
in PLGGs.5,29,30 The most frequent rearrangement/indel 
detected was the BRAF-KIAA1549 rearrangement found in 
PLGGs (Fig. 2C).5,29,31,32 
We also detected EWSR1 rearrange-
ments in 2 tumors: an integrase interactor 1–deficient AT/
RT with EWSR1-PLAGL1 fusion and a spinal ependymoma 
with EWSR1-BEND2 fusion. We further validated the pres-
ence of the EWSR1-PLAGL1 rearrangement in the first 
tumor using whole-genome sequencing (Supplementary 
Figure 2). Rearrangements involving EWSR1 have recently 
been suggested as defining a subclass of central PNETs,25 
and PLAGL genes have been previously implicated as 
a driver in gliomas.33 This alteration raises the question 
whether EWSR1 fusions occur in multiple tumor types or 
whether there may be potential overlap between central 
PNET and “classic” AT/RT
.
Medulloblastoma Subtyping Achieved Through 
Integrated Mutation and Copy Number Analysis
Medulloblastoma has been categorized by the most recent 
World Health Organization (WHO) 2016 CNS tumor classi-
fication update34,35 as having 4 biological subtypes: WNT
, 
SHH, Group 3, and Group 4 tumors.25,36–38 These subtypes 
have been defined most commonly using expression pro-
filing and most recently methylation profiling.25,36–38 While 
these technologies have significantly advanced the under-
standing of the biology of medulloblastoma, the most 
appropriate approach to subtyping medulloblastoma in 
the clinical setting remains unclear.
The combination of OncoPanel and aCGH led to the iden-
tification of genomic changes previously associated with 
transcriptome-defined subtypes (WNT
, SHH, Group 3, and 
Group 4) in 89% (17/19) of medulloblastomas (Fig. 3A and 
3B, Supplementary Table 4). Of the 31 medulloblastoma 
tumors in our study cohort, 30 were analyzed by aCGH 
and 19 were assessed by both OncoPanel and aCGH. We 
focused on the integrated analysis of somatic copy number 
alteration and SNV data across these 19 tumors in order to 
identify recurrent alterations and genomic subtyping per-
formance. 
To categorize these tumors, we defined a classi-
fication scheme of “genetic WNT
,
” “genetic SHH,
” “genetic 
3,
” “genetic 4,
” or “genetic 3 or 4” based upon the presence 
of genetic features previously associated with these sub-
types (see Methods, Fig. 3A, and Supplementary Table 4). 
For example, we classified tumors with CTNNB1 mutations 
or monosomy 6 as genetic WNT; SHH pathway alterations 
(Patched 1 [PTCH1] mutations, or 9q loss, or chromothrip-
sis combined with tumor protein 53 [TP53] loss) as genetic 
SHH; 2 or more of MYC amplification, Group 3 associated

polysomies, DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box 31, or growth 
factor independent 1–family alterations as genetic 3; and 
structural alterations, including isochromosome 17q, as 
genetic 4. Criteria used to subtype each individual tumor 
are included in Fig. 3B.
CTNNB1 mutations and monosomy 6 co-occurred in 
all tumors with mutations in either gene and were pre-
sent in 16% (3/19) of tumors, consistent with genetic WNT 
(Fig. 3A). Four tumors harbored PTCH1 mutations, defining 
them as genetic SHH. MYC amplification was detected in 
60% (3/5) of tumors, consistent with genetic 3, and Idic(17)
(p11.2) was detected in 3 tumors, classified as genetic 
4. Two tumors (10%) could not be definitively assigned to a 
subclass. However, these tumors lacked definitive WNT or 
SHH features and therefore likely belonged to Group 3 or 
Group 4 tumors. One exhibited focal gain/subclonal ampli-
fication of OTX2, favoring a Group 3 tumor.
Clinically Actionable Alterations in PLGGs with 
Implications for Targeted Therapy
We performed comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) of 
18 PLGGs using both aCGH and OncoPanel and identified 
diagnosis-relevant alterations in 55% of PLGGs (Fig. 4A). 
Among pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs), 88% (7/8) harbored 
KIAA1549-BRAF rearrangements, including all cerebellar 
(6/6) and cerebral (1/1) PAs. BRAF V600E mutations were

LGG (NOS), including 2 FGFR1 events (rearrangement and 
mutation) and a BRAF-KIAA1549 rearrangement. An optic 
pathway PA showed no detectable alterations, including in 
BRAF or NF1, suggesting the need for broader analysis via 
whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing.
Genomic Profiling-Aided Treatment Planning 
with Targeted Therapies
A key goal of precision medicine and genomic profiling is 
to better guide the use of targeted therapies in patients. 
While no targeted therapies are currently FDA approved for 
pediatric brain tumors, several ongoing clinical trials are 
evaluating such treatments. In our cohort the identification 
of BRAF alterations guided the use of targeted inhibitors in 
the clinical setting (Fig. 4B). Of the 12 patients with BRAF-
altered PLGGs, 8 were treated with surgery alone and did 
not require any other tumor-directed therapy. Four required 
further therapy, 2 of whom received treatment with a tar-
geted inhibitor (BRAF inhibitor for one patient with a BRAF 
V600E mutation, and an inhibitor of mammalian target of 
rapamycin for a patient with a BRAF-KIAA1549 rearrange-
ment). The patient with the BRAF V600E mutation was a 
7-year-old girl who presented with seizures and was sub-
sequently diagnosed with disseminated ganglioglioma. 
Pathology revealed a glioneuronal neoplasm, for which 
immunohistochemistry was used to identify the BRAF 
V600E mutant protein (Fig. 4C). OncoPanel subsequently 
validated the presence of the BRAF V600E mutation. The 
patient was started on treatment with a BRAF inhibitor 
(dabrafenib), and a response to treatment was observed 
within 3 months of initiation of therapy (Fig. 4D).
In addition to BRAF alterations, OncoPanel detected pre-
viously reported driver alterations in PLGGs,5,29,30 including 
those affecting FGFR, NTRK, MYB family members, and IDH1. 
While IDH1/2 mutations are less common in pediatric com-
pared with adult brain tumors, we identified IDH1 (R132H) 
variants in diffuse astrocytoma (2/3), oligoastrocytoma (1/1), 
oligodendroglioma (1/1), and anaplastic astrocytoma (1/5). 
The co-occurrence of IDH1/2, TP53, and ATRX mutations in 
PLGGs aligns with the signature previously reported in adult 
lower-grade astrocytomas.39 These findings highlight the 
necessity of broad multiplexed assays to genomically profile

tumors, particularly in the adolescent age group, to distin-
guish adult versus pediatric diffuse astrocytoma types, which 
have dramatically different clinical outcomes and prognoses. 
Adult type astrocytomas are diagnosed in late adolescence, 
harboring genomic alterations more consistent with those 
seen in the adult disease (IDH, ATRX, 
TP53). 
Thus, such tumors 
should be regarded as young adult astrocytomas, analogous 
to those arising in older adults.
Profiling of High-Grade Gliomas Reveal 
Alterations with Diagnostic and Therapeutic 
Implications
We examined a cohort of 12 pediatric HGGs, defined as 
WHO grades III and IV tumors, and observed alterations in 
genes previously reported to be associated with pediatric 
HGG in 9 of 12 patients (Fig. 5). 
Two of the 3 tumors for which 
we did not identify driver alterations were infant HGGs. 
TP53 mutations were detected in 40% of high-grade astro-
cytomas, including 2/5 anaplastic astrocytomas and 4/10 
GBM tumors. H3F3A mutations were detected in 2/10 cases 
of GBM and included p.G34R (aka p.G35R) and p.K27M 
variants. NF1 and ATRX alterations were detected in 30% 
of GBM with 2 tumors harboring both an ATRX and an NF1 
mutation. The hypermutator phenotype was detected in 2 
untreated GBM patients with an average of 147 variants per 
tumor, often with multiple alterations per gene.
Comprehensive genomic analysis revealed clinically 
targetable mutations (Fig. 5B). Small molecule inhibitors 
for 6 targets (BRAF
, PDGFRA H3F3A [histone deacetylase 
inhibitors], cell cycle inhibitors, and phosphatidylino-
sitol-3 kinase inhibitors) have entered early phase clini-
cal trials in pediatrics. In addition, brain-penetrant small 
molecules directed specifically against IDH1 (R132H) are 
currently in clinical trials for adults and likely to enter the 
pediatric arena in the near future, while pediatric clini-
cal trials are currently being designed for FGFR inhibi-
tors. These data suggest that CGP provides meaningful 
data that can guide precision medicine for children with 
HGGs.
Discussion
We present the largest cohort of pediatric brain tumors 
that have undergone genomic profiling in a CLIA-certified 
setting. In this cohort we observe clinically relevant altera-
tions (Tiers 1–3 mutations and rearrangements) in 56% 
of patients. The genomic profiles also had diagnostic rel-
evance. Embryonal tumors were found to harbor distinct

copy number profiles compared with glial tumors. The 
combination of targeted sequencing with genome-wide 
copy number profiling revealed subtype-relevant altera-
tions in 89% of all medulloblastoma.
We found that CGP was useful for improved clinical care 
of the patient. Histological diagnoses of pediatric brain 
tumors based on the current WHO CNS classification40 pre-
sent diagnostic challenges, with a number of tumors that 
cannot be reliably distinguished. 
The classification of pedi-
atric brain tumors based on genomic profiling provides 
both diagnostic and prognostic insight into many disease 
types.5,25,29,30,36,37
,41,42 
Thus, the ability to diagnose pediatric 
brain tumors based on genomic profiles is likely to be of 
great clinical utility. Our finding that copy number profiles 
broadly differ between embryonal and glial lineages holds 
the potential to further improve accuracy and reproduc-
ibility of diagnostics, particularly as increased numbers of 
tumors are profiled.
Recent large-scale efforts to profile the somatic cancer 
genomes of pediatric brain tumors have heralded the arrival 
of precision medicine in pediatric neuro-oncology. Our CGP 
revealed alterations in a number of genes for which inhibi-
tors are currently in early phase pediatric clinical trials, 
including BRAF
, IDH1, PIK3CA, PDGFRA, and KIT, as well 
as those for which inhibitors have entered, or are about to 
enter, early phase pediatric clinical trials including FGFR1, 
NTRK 2/3/4, MYC, or MYCN. Targeted therapeutics are 
likely to be most effective when deployed against tumors 
that have been characterized at a genomic level. Thus it is 
important that clinical practices in pediatric neuro-oncology 
incorporate comprehensive genomic analysis that will 
allow the identification of optimal patients for each targeted 
therapeutic agent.
Medulloblastomas have been consistently suggested 
to comprise at least 4 distinct biological subgroups with 
specific clinical and prognostic significance.36,37
,41,43 
These 
groups are robust across independent platforms, includ-
ing gene-expression profiling and methylation profil-
ing. However, these studies have been performed in a 
research setting, and the best methodology to translate 
these findings to the clinic remains unclear. In particular, 
RNA and methylation profiling are poorly suited to iden-
tifying therapeutic targets in specific tumors. In contrast, 
DNA-based genetic analysis of targeted gene panels is 
cost-effective, provides clinically actionable results, and 
tends to be more consistent across sites and experimen-
tal conditions.
Previous efforts have identified a strong concordance 
between genomic alterations and WHO subtype in medul-
loblastoma.36,37
,41 We believe that leveraging these findings 
provides a more clinically useful route to tumor classifi-
cation. Using our genomic approach of targeted exome 
sequencing combined with genome-wide copy number pro-
filing, we identified subgroup-specific genomic alterations 
in almost 90% of medulloblastomas. Subgroup-specific 
clinical trials are now open to accrual (ClinicalTrials.gov IDs 
NCT01878617
, NCT01601184, and NCT02212574). In addition, 
targeted therapeutics for specific genomic alterations in 
medulloblastoma are likely to have an increasing role in the 
treatment of children with medulloblastoma, highlighting

the necessity of implementing technologies that allow the 
subtyping of medulloblastoma in the clinical setting. It will 
be useful to determine from these trials the relative value 
of genetic, transcriptomic, and methylation-based profiling 
in classifying patients. A limitation to our study is that sub-
typing of tumors in this cohort was not correlated to match-
ing transcriptomic subtyping from the same tumors; future 
work will be needed to complete this effort.
Three questions merit particular focus in further study. 
First, to what extent do transcriptomic and epigenetic 
profiling add to the clinical utility of genetic profiles? 
Subclassification of pediatric brain tumors based upon 
these modalities has been performed in the research set-
ting25,29,36–38 and is now beginning to be implemented clini-
cally (ClinicalTrials.gov IDs NCT02285439, NCT02212574, 
and NCT01878617). Second, what is the predictive and 
prognostic value of any of these assays? Formal evaluation 
of the relative impact of each assay on clinically relevant 
metrics is necessary. Third, what is the impact of tumor 
heterogeneity on the validity of clinical genomic results 
and on the treatments being implemented? Heterogeneity 
has increasingly been observed across various types of 
tumors, but the impact of such heterogeneity on the robust-
ness of clinical data has not been formally evaluated.
