Abstract
Problem/Condition: Known foodborne disease agents are estimated to cause approximately 9.4 million illnesses each year in the 
United States. Although only a small subset of illnesses are associated with recognized outbreaks, data from outbreak investigations 
provide insight into the foods and pathogens that cause illnesses and the settings and conditions in which they occur.
Reporting Period: 2009–2015
Description of System: The Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System (FDOSS) collects data on foodborne disease 
outbreaks, which are defined as the occurrence of two or more cases of a similar illness resulting from the ingestion of a common 
food. Since the early 1960s, foodborne outbreaks have been reported voluntarily to CDC by state, local, and territorial health 
departments using a standard form. Beginning in 2009, FDOSS reporting was made through the National Outbreak Reporting 
System, a web-based platform launched that year.
Results: During 2009–2015, FDOSS received reports of 5,760 outbreaks that resulted in 100,939 illnesses, 5,699 hospitalizations, 
and 145 deaths. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and CDC reported outbreaks. Among 2,953 outbreaks with 
a single confirmed etiology, norovirus was the most common cause of outbreaks (1,130 outbreaks [38%]) and outbreak-associated 
illnesses (27,623 illnesses [41%]), followed by Salmonella with 896 outbreaks (30%) and 23,662 illnesses (35%). Outbreaks caused 
by Listeria, Salmonella, and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) were responsible for 82% of all hospitalizations and 
82% of deaths reported. Among 1,281 outbreaks in which the food reported could be classified into a single food category, fish 
were the most commonly implicated category (222 outbreaks [17%]), followed by dairy (136 [11%]) and chicken (123 [10%]). 
The food categories responsible for the most outbreak-associated illnesses were chicken (3,114 illnesses [12%]), pork (2,670 
[10%]), and seeded vegetables (2,572 [10%]). Multistate outbreaks comprised only 3% of all outbreaks reported but accounted 
for 11% of illnesses, 34% of hospitalizations, and 54% of deaths.
Interpretation: Foodborne disease outbreaks provide information about the pathogens and foods responsible for illness. Norovirus 
remains the leading cause of foodborne disease outbreaks, highlighting the continued need for food safety improvements targeting 
worker health and hygiene in food service settings. Outbreaks caused by Listeria, Salmonella, and STEC are important targets for 
public health intervention efforts, and improving the safety of chicken, pork, and seeded vegetables should be a priority.
Public Health Action: The causes of foodborne illness should continue to be tracked and analyzed to inform disease prevention 
policies and initiatives. Strengthening the capacity of state and local health departments to investigate and report outbreaks will 
assist with these efforts through identification of the foods, etiologies, and settings linked to these outbreaks.
Introduction
Approximately 800 foodborne disease outbreaks are 
reported in the United States each year, accounting for 
approximately 15,000 illnesses, 800 hospitalizations, and 
20 deaths (1). Outbreak-associated foodborne illnesses are 
only a small subset of the estimated 9.4 million foodborne 
illnesses from known pathogens that occur annually in the 
United States (2). However, the food sources and exposure 
settings for illnesses that are not part of outbreaks can be 
determined only rarely. Outbreak investigations, on the other 
hand, often link etiologies with specific foods, allowing public 
health officials, regulatory agencies, and the food industry 
to investigate how foods become contaminated. Foodborne 
outbreak data also can be used to identify emerging food

safety issues and to assess whether programs to prevent 
illnesses from particular foods are effective. 
This report summarizes foodborne disease outbreaks 
reported in the United States in which the first illness occurred 
between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2015. The 
report highlights a few large outbreaks as well as novel foods 
and food-pathogen pairs responsible for outbreaks during the 
reporting period.
Methods
A foodborne disease outbreak is defined as two or more 
cases of a similar illness resulting from ingestion of a common 
food (3). When exposure to a contaminated food occurs 
in a single state, the outbreak is classified as a single-state 
outbreak; when exposure occurs in two or more states, the 
outbreak is classified as a multistate outbreak. Local, state, and 
territorial health departments voluntarily report foodborne 
outbreaks to CDC through the Foodborne Disease Outbreak 
Surveillance System (FDOSS) (https://www.cdc.gov/fdoss/). 
CDC staff also report multistate foodborne disease outbreaks 
to FDOSS; these outbreaks are identified by PulseNet, the 
national molecular subtyping network (4). Initially a paper-
based surveillance system, FDOSS reporting became electronic 
in 1998. In 2009, FDOSS was incorporated into the newly 
created National Outbreak Reporting System, a web-based 
platform that also includes reports of outbreaks attributable to 
waterborne, person-to-person, animal contact, environmental, 
and indeterminate or unknown modes of transmission. 
Etiologies reported to FDOSS include bacterial, parasitic, 
and viral pathogens as well as chemicals and toxins. Outbreak 
etiologies are classified as unknown, suspected, or confirmed. 
Specific criteria (i.e., laboratory testing and clinical syndrome) 
are used to classify etiologies of outbreaks as suspected or 
confirmed (5). An outbreak is categorized as a multiple etiology 
outbreak if more than one agent is reported.
Foods and ingredients are identified as outbreak sources 
(i.e., implicated) using one or more of the following types of 
evidence: epidemiologic, laboratory, traceback, environmental 
assessment, or other data. Some outbreak investigations 
do not identify a source and in these instances the food is 
reported as unknown. CDC categorizes foods implicated in 
outbreak investigations on the basis of a hierarchical scheme 
(6). One of 24 food categories (e.g., mollusks) is assigned if a 
single contaminated ingredient (e.g., raw oysters) is reported 
as the source or if all implicated ingredients belong to the 
same category (e.g., raw oysters and raw clams). When a food 
or contaminated ingredient cannot be assigned to a single 
category, the outbreak is classified as not attributed to a single 
food category (7). The place where the implicated food was 
prepared is reported as one of 23 locations (e.g., a camp, farm, 
grocery store, or private home).
Population-based reporting rates were calculated for each 
state by use of U.S. Census Bureau estimates of the mid-year 
state populations for 2009–2015 (8). This report includes all 
foodborne outbreaks with a date of first illness onset from 
January, 1, 2009, through December, 31, 2015, but reported 
to FDOSS and finalized as of April 10, 2017.
Results
During 2009–2015, FDOSS received reports of 5,760 
outbreaks, resulting in 100,939 illnesses, 5,699 hospitalizations, 
and 145 deaths (Figure 1). Outbreaks were reported by all 
50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and CDC 
(Figure 2). The single-state outbreak reporting rate was 2.6 
outbreaks per 1 million population. The overall national 
reporting rate (which includes multistate outbreaks) during 
2009–2015 was also 2.6 outbreaks per 1 million population. 
Single-state outbreaks accounted for 5,583 (97%) of all outbreaks 
with 89,907 cases (median: 8 cases per outbreak; range: 2–800 
cases). Four percent of these ill persons (3,733) were reported 
as being hospitalized. Multistate outbreaks accounted for 177 
(3%) of all outbreaks with 11,032 cases (median: 20 cases per 
outbreak; range: 2–1,939 cases). Eighteen percent of these ill 
persons (1,966) were hospitalized.
Etiologic Agents
A single confirmed etiology was reported for 2,953 (51%) 
outbreaks, resulting in 67,130 illnesses, 5,114 hospitalizations, 
and 140 deaths (Table 1). Among 2,953 outbreaks with a single 
confirmed etiology, norovirus was the most common cause of 
outbreaks (1,130 outbreaks [38%]) and outbreak-associated 
illnesses (27,623 illnesses [41%]). Salmonella was the second 
most common single confirmed etiology reported, with 896 
outbreaks (30%) and 23,662 illnesses (35%), followed by 
Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) (191 outbreaks 
[6%]), Campylobacter (155 [5%]), Clostridium perfringens 
(108 [4%]), scombroid toxin (95 [3%]), ciguatoxin (80 [3%]), 
Staphylococcus aureus (35 [1%]), Vibrio parahaemolyticus 
(35 [1%]), and Listeria monocytogenes (35 [1%]). Listeria, 
Salmonella, and STEC were the most common causes of 
hospitalizations (82%) and deaths (82%) reported among 
persons in outbreaks with a single confirmed etiology.

Location of Food Preparation
A location of preparation was provided for 5,022 outbreak 
reports (87%), with 4,696 (94%) indicating a single location 
(Table 2). Among outbreaks reporting a single location of 
preparation, restaurants were the most common location 
(2,880 outbreaks [61%]), followed by catering or banquet 
facilities (636 [14%]) and private homes (561 [12%]). Sit-
down dining style restaurants (2,239 [48%]) were the most 
commonly reported type of restaurant. The locations of food 
preparation with the most outbreak-associated illnesses were 
restaurants (33,465 illnesses [43%]), catering or banquet 
facilities (18,141 [24%]), and institutions, such as schools 
(9,806 [13%]). The preparation location with the largest 
average number of illnesses per outbreak was institutions 
(46.5), whereas restaurants had the smallest (11.6).
Foods
Outbreak investigators identified a food in 2,442 outbreaks 
(42%). These outbreaks resulted in 51,341 illnesses (51%) 
(Table 3). The food reported belonged to a single food category 
in 1,281 outbreaks (22%). The food category most commonly 
implicated was fish (222 outbreaks [17%]), followed by dairy 
(136 [11%]) and chicken (123 [10%]). The food categories 
responsible for the most outbreak-associated illnesses were 
chicken (3,114 illnesses [12%]), pork (2,670 [10%]), and 
seeded vegetables (2,572 [10%]). Scombroid toxin in fish was 
the single confirmed etiology and food category pair responsible 
for the most outbreaks (85), followed by ciguatoxin in fish (72) 
and Campylobacter in dairy (60) (Table 4). The pathogen-
food category pairs that caused the most outbreak-associated 
illnesses were Salmonella in eggs (2,422 illnesses), Salmonella in 
seeded vegetables (2,203), and Salmonella in chicken (1,941). 
In comparison, scombroid toxin and ciguatoxin outbreaks from 
fish resulted in 519 outbreak-associated illnesses, an average of 
three illnesses per outbreak. Outbreaks of Salmonella infections 
from seeded vegetables resulted in an average of 88 illnesses 
per outbreak, and outbreaks of Salmonella infections from eggs 
resulted in an average of 78 illnesses per outbreak.
Several novel food vehicles caused outbreaks during the study 
period. In 2011, an outbreak of Salmonella serotype Enteritidis 
infections linked to pine nuts imported from Turkey resulted 
in 53 illnesses and two hospitalizations. In 2014, an outbreak 
of Salmonella serotypes Gaminara, Hartford, and Oranienburg 
in chia seed powder imported from Canada caused 45 illnesses 
and seven hospitalizations. An outbreak of STEC serogroups 
O26 and O121 infections that began in 2015 was linked to 
raw wheat flour produced in the United States; it resulted in 
56 illnesses and 16 hospitalizations in 24 states. An outbreak of 
Salmonella serotype Virchow infections attributable to moringa 
leaf powder imported from South Africa began in 2015 and 
caused 35 illnesses and six hospitalizations in 24 states. It was 
an ingredient of an organic powdered shake mix branded to 
be used as a meal replacement.
Multistate Outbreaks
Multistate outbreaks comprised only 3% of outbreaks but 
were responsible for 11% of illnesses, 34% of hospitalizations, 
and 54% of deaths. Multistate outbreaks involved a median of 
seven states with a range of two to 45 states in which exposure 
occurred. The largest of the 177 multistate outbreaks was caused 
by Salmonella serotype Enteritidis and due to contaminated 
shell eggs. An estimated 1,939 persons were infected in 10 
states beginning in 2010. An outbreak of Salmonella serotype 
Poona infections attributed to cucumbers in 2015 had 
the second highest number of illnesses (907 illnesses in 40 
states). This outbreak also had the most outbreak-associated 
hospitalizations (204 [22% of cases]). An outbreak of 
Salmonella serotype Heidelberg infections attributed to chicken 
during 2013–2014 had the second most hospitalizations 
(200 [32% of cases]) and involved persons from 29 states and 
Puerto Rico. An outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes infections 
attributed to cantaloupes in 28 states in 2011 had the most 
deaths (33 [22% of cases]), followed in 2014 by an outbreak 
in 12 states of Listeria monocytogenes infections attributed to

Discussion
Despite considerable advances in food safety in the United 
States during recent decades, foodborne disease outbreaks 
remain a serious public health problem. The majority of 
the outbreaks reported had relatively small case counts, and 
affected persons often were exposed in a single state. However, 
outbreaks with the largest case counts and most severe 
outcomes (e.g. highest proportion of ill persons hospitalized 
and most deaths) typically involved exposures in multiple 
states, reflecting factors such as the geographical distribution 
of the implicated food and the characteristics of the pathogens 
involved. Foods produced in other countries sometimes were 
implicated, highlighting the interconnectedness of the U.S. 
food supply with that of other nations, and the continued 
need to ensure that all foods are safe to eat (10).
As reported in previous summaries (11), norovirus 
remains the leading cause of foodborne disease outbreaks 
and outbreak-associated illnesses in the United States. Most 
foodborne norovirus outbreaks are associated with ready-to-
eat foods contaminated during preparation by infected food 
workers in restaurants and other food service settings (12). As

such, continued efforts are needed to strengthen and ensure 
compliance with requirements in the FDA Model Food 
Code (13), specifically those that exclude symptomatic and 
post-symptomatic workers, prohibit bare-hand contact with 
ready-to-eat foods, and ensure appropriate hand washing. 
Contaminated raw food products, specifically leafy vegetables, 
fruits, and mollusks, also have been implicated in norovirus 
outbreaks (12); thus, upstream contamination during 
production also should be considered in foodborne norovirus 
outbreak investigations.
Fish was the most frequently implicated food, but the 
number of illnesses associated with these outbreaks tended to 
be small compared with other food vehicles, largely because 
of the pathogens involved. Differences in outbreak size are in 
part attributable to how pathogens contaminate foods: toxins 
are produced in individual fish, whereas Salmonella and other 
bacterial pathogens, such as STEC, can contaminate large 
amounts of product across vast distribution chains (14). This 
helps explain why bacterial pathogens are the most common 
causes of multistate outbreaks and why many persons can 
become ill during a single bacterial disease outbreak.
Identification of novel food sources provides insight into 
evolving food preferences in the United States and the types of 
foods that pathogens can contaminate. It also raises important 
scientific questions regarding how these pathogens remain 
viable in these foods long enough to cause infection. During 
the study period, a few novel food vehicles were identified as 
the sources of multistate outbreaks of Listeria, Salmonella, and 
STEC infections. Some of these (chia seed powder, raw wheat 
flour, and moringa leaf powder) are dried, shelf-stable foods not 
usually considered as possible sources of illness. These outbreak 
reports provide additional evidence that Salmonella and STEC 
can survive extensive processing steps as well as months in a 
desiccated state. This ability of pathogens to remain viable 
combined with the long shelf life of these products emphasizes 
the need for clear, well-publicized product recall notices.
Salmonella and STEC were two of the most common 
causes of large outbreaks. Regulatory-focused public health 
interventions, such as the 2009 Egg Safety Rule, the 2011 
Food Safety Modernization Act, and the 2013 Salmonella 
Action Plan, were designed and implemented in part to help 
ensure the safety of foods that can be contaminated by these 
pathogens (15–17). Some members of the food industry also 
are promoting a culture of food safety by requiring growers, 
producers, and distributors to adhere to strict safety guidelines 
designed to prevent contamination. Additional efforts will 
likely be needed by both government and industry to help 
control these pathogens.
Limitations
The findings of this report are subject to at least four 
limitations. First, because CDC’s foodborne outbreak 
surveillance is dynamic and agencies can submit, update, or 
delete reports at any time, the results of this analysis might 
differ slightly from previous or future reports. Second, not all 
outbreaks are identified and the majority of foodborne illnesses 
occur outside the context of a recognized outbreak. The degree 
to which the food vehicles, etiologies, and locations implicated 
in outbreaks represent the vehicles, etiologies, and locations of 
sporadic foodborne illness is unknown. Third, some outbreaks 
have an unknown food vehicle, an unknown etiology, or both, 
and analyses and conclusions drawn from outbreaks with an 
identified food vehicle and confirmed etiology might not be 
representative of all outbreaks. Finally, pathogens that are not 
known to cause illness sometimes are reported as a confirmed 
or suspected etiology.
Conclusion
Foodborne disease outbreaks remain an important public 
health issue. Data collected during outbreak investigations 
provide insight into the foods and pathogens that cause illnesses 
and the settings and conditions in which they occur. Continued 
efforts must be made to track and to analyze the causes of 
foodborne illness to inform targeted prevention efforts. In 
particular, strengthening the capacity of state and local health 
departments to investigate and to report outbreaks will improve 
foodborne disease outbreak surveillance and could help 
decrease the burden of foodborne illness through identification 
of foods, etiologies, outbreak settings, and specific points of 
contamination, which can inform intervention efforts.

Abbreviations: CE = confirmed etiology; SE = suspected etiology.
 * Guidelines for reporting agencies are to consider an etiology confirmed if it meets confirmation criteria (https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/outbreaks/investigating-
outbreaks/confirming_diagnosis.html); otherwise, it is considered suspected. Agents that are not listed in confirmation criteria or that are not known to cause 
illness are sometimes reported as confirmed or suspected etiologies.
 † Salmonella serotypes causing more than five outbreaks were Enteritidis (264 outbreaks), Typhimurium (102), Newport (73), Heidelberg (49), I 4,[5],12:i:- (41), Javiana 
(37), Braenderup (29), Infantis (24), Montevideo (20), Muenchen (18), Thompson (17), Saintpaul (16), Oranienburg (15), Paratyphi B (10), Uganda (9), Agona (8), 
Typhimurium var Cope (8), Hadar (7), Mbandaka (7), Miami (6), and Virchow (6).
 § STEC serogroups O157 (156 outbreaks), O26 (14), O111 (7), O121 (6), O145 (5), multiple serogroups (4), O45 (4), O103 (3), unknown serogroup (3), and O186 (1).
 ¶ Campylobacter jejuni (140 outbreaks), Campylobacter unknown species (49), Campylobacter multiple species (6), Campylobacter coli (5), and Campylobacter other (1).
 ** Shigella sonnei (33 outbreaks), Shigella flexneri (4), and Shigella unknown species (2).
 †† The denominator for the etiology percentages is the single etiology total. The denominator for the single etiology, multiple etiologies, and unknown etiology is 
the total. Because of rounding, numbers might not add up to the single etiology total or the total.
 §§ If at least two etiologies are confirmed in an outbreak, it is considered a confirmed multiple etiology outbreak; otherwise it is considered a suspected multiple 
etiology outbreak.
 ¶¶ An etiologic agent was not confirmed or suspected based on clinical, laboratory, or epidemiologic information.
