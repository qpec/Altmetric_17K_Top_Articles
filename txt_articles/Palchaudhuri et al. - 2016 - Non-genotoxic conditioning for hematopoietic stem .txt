Abstract
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) offers curative therapy for patients with 
hemoglobinopathies, congenital immunodeficiencies, and other conditions, possibly including 
AIDS. Autologous HSCT using genetically corrected cells would avoid the risk of graft-versus-
host disease (GVHD), but the genotoxicity of conditioning remains a substantial barrier to the 
development of this approach. Here we report an internalizing immunotoxin targeting the 
hematopoietic-cell-restricted CD45 receptor that effectively conditions immunocompetent mice. A

 single dose of the immunotoxin, CD45–saporin (SAP), enabled efficient (>90%) engraftment of 
donor cells and full correction of a sickle-cell anemia model. In contrast to irradiation, CD45–SAP 
completely avoided neutropenia and anemia, spared bone marrow and thymic niches, enabling 
rapid recovery of T and B cells, preserved anti-fungal immunity, and had minimal overall toxicity. 
This non-genotoxic conditioning method may provide an attractive alternative to current 
conditioning regimens for HSCT in the treatment of non-malignant blood diseases.
HSCT, one of the fastest-growing hospital procedures in the United States1, is widely used 
to treat hematological malignancies. However, the ability of HSCT to cure a broad range of 
non-malignant diseases is severely underutilized. Hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell 
anemia and thalassemia, which affect millions of patients globally, are curable by HSCT 
when stable mixed chimerism (>25% donor-derived leukocytes in peripheral blood) restores 
hemoglobin and red blood cell parameters to >95% of normal2; disease-free survival in such 
cases is >90%3–6. In addition to hemoglobinopathies, the hematologic manifestations of 
other non-malignant conditions, such as Fanconi anemia7 and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome8; 
genetic conditions that cause neurologic decline, such as metachromatic leukodystrophy9; 
and immunodeficiencies, such as adenosine deaminase severe combined immunodeficiency 
(SCID)10, can be cured by HSCT. Furthermore, HSCT may provide benefit in the treatment 
of type I diabetes11 and AIDS12 and for induction of immune tolerance in organ 
transplantation13. The obstacles to using allogeneic HSCT in these diverse conditions relate 
primarily to the frequency of life-threatening GVHD, of acute complications that result from 
the cytotoxic effects of conditioning, such as mucositis and infections, and of long-term, 
irreversible complications that arise from the genotoxic effects of conditioning.
Advances in gene therapy and genome editing are enabling new approaches to HSCT using 
a patient’s own cells that have been genetically corrected ex vivo. Clinical evidence of 
benefit from this approach for immunodeficiencies, such as SCID (X-linked and adenosine 
deaminase)14,15, chronic granulomatous disease16,17, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome18, 
metachromatic leukodystrophy9, autoimmune systemic sclerosis19, and 
hemoglobinopathies20,21 is encouraging. Autologous HSCT eliminates the risk of GVHD 
but not the toxicities of conditioning. For example, a gene therapy trial for 
hemoglobinopathy was complicated by grade 3 or greater toxicities in all six patients, 
including premature menopause in a teenage girl (as presented)21. Another recent trial of 
autologous HSCT, for systemic sclerosis, showed a survival benefit in some patients but also 
10% immediate after-transplant mortality19. The purpose of conditioning is to deplete host 
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow niche so that transplanted HSCs will 
engraft efficiently. Current conditioning regimens involve total body irradiation (TBI) and/or 
cytotoxic drugs, which are non-targeted and genotoxic and have multiple short- and long-
term adverse effects22,23. The toxicities of conditioning lessen the willingness of patients 
and healthcare providers to consider this therapy except under extreme circumstances. 
Therefore, advancing autologous HSCT to the many patients who might benefit will require 
solving the problem of pre-transplant conditioning.
A promising avenue for improving the safety of conditioning is the use of drugs, such as 
antibodies, that are specifically targeted to HSCs and other hematopoietic cells in the bone

 marrow niche and that spare non-hematopoietic cells. Thus far, studies of targeted 
conditioning approaches in mice, a useful model organism for HSCT research, have shown 
either poor donor-cell engraftment or efficacy limited to immunocompromised 
backgrounds24–27. A conditioning regimen that minimized off-target toxicity and 
immunosuppression while enabling efficient engraftment would greatly expand the curative 
application of HSCT.
Here we describe CD45–SAP, a hematopoietic-cell-specific immunotoxin consisting of 
saporin (SAP) conjugated to a CD45-targeting antibody. SAP is a catalytic N-glycosidase 
ribosome-inactivating protein that halts protein synthesis28. Unlike other ricin family 
members, it lacks a general cell entry domain and is non-toxic unless conjugated to a 
targeting antibody or ligand capable of receptor-mediated internalization28. SAP and other 
protein-based immunotoxins have been widely explored in cancer therapy, with greater 
success for hematological malignancies than for solid tumors29,30. However, they have not 
been studied as a conditioning strategy in HSCT to our knowledge. We identified CD45–
SAP from an in vivo HSC depletion screen exploring SAP-based immunotoxins targeted to 
various cell surface receptors present on HSCs. We show that CD45–SAP is an internalizing 
immunotoxin that efficiently conditions immunocompetent mice for autologous HSCT, 
minimizes undesirable toxicity and promotes rapid immunological recovery compared with 
conventional TBI conditioning.
RESULTS
CD45–SAP is a potent immunotoxin capable of depleting HSCs
To evaluate immunotoxins as a means of depleting endogenous HSCs from their niches, we 
targeted a set of cell-surface antigens present on mouse and human HSCs with SAP-based 
immunotoxins. We conducted our experiments in fully immunocompetent C57Bl/6 mice, a 
background that has proven challenging for antibody-based conditioning26. Immunotoxins 
were prepared by combining appropriate biotinylated monoclonal antibodies with a 
streptavidin–SAP conjugate. To assess HSC depletion, we harvested bone marrow 8 d after 
intravenous injection of 3 mg/kg immunotoxin and quantified HSCs 
(Lin−cKit+Sca1+CD48−CD150+) by flow cytometry. (Fig. 1a). We evaluated seven candidate 
antigen targets known to be present on both murine and human HSCs in our in vivo screen: 
CD45, CD49d, CD84, CD90, CD133, CD135, and CD184. CD45–SAP was the most 
efficient in depleting bone marrow HSCs (Supplementary Fig. 1a).
Ratio and dose optimization studies (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1b) identified a single 
CD45–SAP dose (by intravenous (i.v.) injection) of 3 mg/kg of 1:1 antibody to streptavidin–
SAP ratio as achieving the highest immunophenotypic HSC depletion (98% by flow 
cytometry). The colony-forming activity of bone marrow progenitors decreased in a dose-
dependent manner but was less adversely affected than HSCs (Fig. 1b). Competitive bone 
marrow transplantation confirmed the depletion of functional HSCs by CD45–SAP 
(Supplementary Fig. 1c). As expected, non-biotinylated CD45 antibody plus streptavidin–
SAP did not deplete HSCs in vivo (Fig. 1c). Furthermore, as the CD45 monoclonal antibody 
employed (clone 104) selectively recognizes the CD45.2 isoform of mouse CD45, the 
immunotoxin was unable to deplete HSCs in CD45.1 congenic mice (Supplementary Fig. 
Palchaudhuri et al.

 1d). Together, these results are consistent with antigen-specific depletion of HSCs by CD45–
SAP.
To further characterize CD45–SAP, we performed a series of in vitro cell death and 
internalization experiments using the mouse hematopoietic cell lines EML (a multi-potent 
hematopoietic progenitor line) and EL4 (a T-cell lymphoma line). EML cells resemble 
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells as they are dependent on stem cell factor for growth 
and undergo multi-lineage differentiation upon cytokine stimulation. In addition to the CD45 
antibody clone 104, we investigated clone 30-F11. Immunotoxins created from both clones 
potently induced EML and EL4 cell death with similar IC50 (50% cell death) values ranging 
between 40 and 71 pM (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1e). Control non-biotinylated 
antibody in the presence of streptavidin–SAP did not induce cell death in vitro (Fig. 1d), 
demonstrating that association of the SAP and the targeting antibody was required. 
Quantification of anti-CD45 antibody internalization in EL4 cells using clone 104 showed 
7% internalization of the naked antibody and 12% internalization of antibody–streptavidin 
complex over a 24 h period (Fig. 1e). Surprisingly, despite equivalent activity of 
immunotoxins created from both anti-CD45 clones in vitro, only immunotoxin created from 
clone 104 was capable of efficient immunophenotypic HSC depletion in vivo 
(Supplementary Fig. 1f). Assessment of the in vivo persistence of the antibodies (24 h after 
administration) revealed that clone 104 prominently bound to peripheral white blood cells, 
splenocytes, and HSC-containing bone marrow Lin−cKit+Sca1+ (LKS) cells, whereas clone 
30-F11 displayed poor persistence in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 1g).
Taken together, these results suggest that in vivo binding and internalization of CD45–SAP 
efficiently depletes HSCs from the mouse bone marrow.
CD45–SAP enables efficient donor-cell engraftment
We next determined whether HSC depletion by CD45–SAP enables engraftment of donor 
cells. As the donor graft may be negatively affected by unbound CD45–SAP in vivo, we 
varied the time of transplantation to identify the optimal transplantation window (Fig. 2a) 
and explored transplantation of two donor cell types (in different cohorts): congenic CD45.1 
cells, which cannot be targeted by CD45–SAP, and syngeneic CD45.2–GFP cells, which can 
potentially be targeted. A dose of ten million bone marrow donor cells was used for 
transplantation, consistent with prior mouse reduced-intensity conditioning studies24,31,32. 
This dose corresponds to ~2% of total mouse marrow33, thereby resembling human 
transplantation in which ~5% of donor marrow is harvested34.
Four months after transplantation, we observed 75–90% donor cell (GFP+ or CD45.1+ cells) 
chimerism within the total white blood cells of the peripheral blood as assessed by flow 
cytometry for both donor cell types in mice conditioned with 3 mg/kg CD45–SAP (Fig. 
2b,c). Notably, equivalent levels of chimerism were observed for cells transplanted between 
2 and 12 d after CD45–SAP administration (Fig. 2b), demonstrating a wide transplantation 
window. Unconditioned control mice did not demonstrate meaningful donor-cell 
engraftment, with chimerism levels <2% (Fig. 2b,c). Similar to peripheral blood chimerism, 
chimerism in bone marrow HSCs in CD45–SAP-conditioned mice at 4 months after 
transplantation was 90% (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Time-course assessment revealed that

 peripheral chimerism was stable and reached 93–94% at 15 months for both donor cell types 
(Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 2b). Myeloid chimerism was established rapidly, within 2 
months, and as expected the highest levels of T- and B-cell donor chimerism appeared after 
longer intervals, likely due to the longer lifespan of resident host lymphoid cells 
(Supplementary Fig. 2c). Analysis of peripheral blood at 8 months after transplantation 
revealed a normal distribution of the myeloid, B- and T-cell lineages, indicative of truly non-
biased stem cell engraftment (Fig. 2e). Stem cell engraftment was further confirmed by 
serial transplantation into lethally irradiated secondary recipients (Supplementary Fig. 2d). 
Notably, conditioning with CD45–SAP was not mouse-strain-specific as both C57BL/6 and 
BALB/c recipients had high levels of donor-cell engraftment (Supplementary Fig. 2e,f). 
HSCs may be immunophenotypically defined as LKS CD34−CD150+, or, alternatively, as 
LKS CD48−CD150+. In addition to bone marrow cell transplants, we tested whether CD45–
SAP conditioning also enabled engraftment of purified HSCs. Transplantation of 2,000 LKS 
CD34−CD150+ HSCs or LKS CD48−CD150+ HSCs yielded 60% myeloid chimerism (Fig. 
2f and Supplementary Fig. 2g) at 4 months, whereas non-conditioned control mice 
transplanted with HSCs did not demonstrate meaningful engraftment (0–0.03% chimerism).
To compare CD45–SAP with other conditioning methods, we investigated conventional TBI 
and experimental antibody-based conditioning using the ACK2 monoclonal antibody, a 
CD117 antagonist25. The chimerism achieved 4 months after transplantation by 3 mg/kg 
CD45–SAP in wild-type mice matched that of 5Gy TBI (50% of lethal TBI dose) 
conditioning (Supplementary Fig. 2h) and was multi-lineage (Supplementary Fig. 2i). 
Conditioning with 28 mg/kg ACK2 did not enable substantial engraftment (<3% 
engraftment) in this immunocompetent background (Supplementary Fig. 2h), consistent with 
previous observations26. Moreover, immunotoxin created from ACK2 (ACK2–SAP; 3 
mg/kg) was also inactive (Supplementary Fig. 2h). Injection of one-tenth the cell dose (one 
million bone marrow cells) confirmed that 3 mg/kg CD45–SAP and 5Gy TBI achieve 
equivalent engraftment (≈20% chimerism) at this lower cell dose, with significant synergy 
(≈90% chimerism) when the conditioning methods were combined (Supplementary Fig. 2j).
Assessment of peripheral myeloid, B-, and T-cell recovery after transplantation 
demonstrated that CD45–SAP conditioning enabled quicker recovery of these cell types 
versus irradiation-based conditioning (Supplementary Fig. 3), and the graft was found to 
contribute to various T-cell subpopulations (Supplementary Fig. 4) in CD45–SAP-
conditioned mice. All donor-derived T-cell subsets examined were significantly elevated 
compared with the same subsets in non-conditioned control mice (P < 0.001 in all subsets).
CD45–SAP preserves the normal bone marrow architecture
As 3 mg/kg CD45–SAP and 5Gy TBI yielded equivalent levels of chimerism, we 
determined the toxicities of these two conditioning approaches by measuring various blood 
and bone marrow parameters in conditioned mice that did not undergo after-conditioning 
transplantation. Both CD45–SAP and 5Gy TBI were not fully myeloablative as they 
permitted long-term survival (>6 months) without stem cell transplantation (n = 12 mice/
group, data not shown). Time course assessment after conditioning revealed that CD45–SAP 
had significantly (P < 0.01) less adverse immediate effects on bone marrow cellularity (Fig. 
Palchaudhuri et al.

 3a), with quicker recovery to normal levels than irradiation (6 vs. 12 d for CD45–SAP vs. 
irradiation, respectively). Similarly, the effect of CD45–SAP on bone marrow progenitor 
cells was less profound than that of irradiation as measured by in vitro colony-forming cell 
activity assays (Fig. 3b). Assessment of specific progenitor types in the bone marrow 
revealed differential effects following 3 mg/kg CD45–SAP versus 5Gy TBI (Supplementary 
Fig. 5). Notably, myeloid progenitors, granulocyte macrophage progenitors, common 
myeloid progenitors, and common lymphoid progenitors were less adversely affected or 
recovered more quickly after CD45–SAP. Despite the overall reduced toxicity of CD45–
SAP toward bone marrow cellularity and short-term progenitors, CD45–SAP depleted HSCs 
as efficiently as irradiation (~98% immunophenotypic depletion, Fig. 3c), although not as 
rapidly.
Femur histology performed 2 d after conditioning suggested that CD45–SAP outperforms 
irradiation not only in preserving bone marrow cellularity but also in maintaining vascular 
integrity within the marrow, as red blood cells remained within blood vessels, similar to 
observations in non-treated control mice (Supplementary Fig. 6). In contrast, 5Gy-irradiated 
mice had lower levels of nucleated cells within the marrow, with dispersion of red blood 
cells throughout, indicating gross disruption of the vasculature. To confirm these differences, 
we performed a functional assay to assess vascular integrity. High molecular weight (2 
MDa) rhodamine–dextran was injected intravenously 2 d after conditioning, and intravital 
imaging of the calvarium bone marrow was performed. Rhodamine–dextran was effectively 
retained within the blood vessels of mice conditioned with CD45–SAP, similar to 
unconditioned control mice, suggesting maintenance of vascular integrity (Fig. 3d). 
Irradiated recipients, however, exhibited diffuse rhodamine–dextran throughout the marrow, 
indicative of compromised vascular integrity. The non-hematopoietic composition of the 
marrow (measured as the ratio of endothelial cells to stromal cells) was significantly (P < 
0.001) altered in irradiated recipients, whereas the composition in immunotoxin-treated 
recipients was similar to that of non-treated control mice (Supplementary Fig. 7). 
Assessment of endosteal cells 2 d after conditioning revealed similarities between CD45–
SAP treatment and non-treated control mice, with preservation of endosteal cell morphology 
(Supplementary Fig. 8). In irradiated recipients, altered morphology of endosteal cells was 
observed, as has been documented by others35 (Supplementary Fig. 8).
Together, these results indicate that CD45–SAP was less detrimental to bone marrow 
cellularity, hematopoietic progenitors, and the marrow microenvironment than 5Gy 
irradiation, while achieving efficient HSC depletion and allowing similar levels of 
engraftment.
CD45–SAP permits more rapid immune recovery
Recovery of adaptive and innate immunity is of paramount importance for survival after 
HSCT, and its failure after conditioning contributes to the morbidity and mortality associated 
with transplantation. Analysis of the peripheral blood following conditioning (without 
transplantation) revealed significant (P < 0.05) differences between 3 mg/kg CD45–SAP and 
5Gy TBI conditioning. Whereas irradiation suppressed myeloid (Mac1+, Gr1+) cells for 28 
d, CD45–SAP-conditioned mice showed an immediate and sizable increase (threefold) in

 circulating myeloid cells that returned to normal levels at 12 d (Fig. 4a). To test innate 
immunity, we challenged non-transplanted conditioned mice with a systemic infection of 
Candida albicans (2 d after conditioning), a clinically relevant fungal strain that infects 
immunocompromised HSCT patients after conditioning. Mice conditioned with 5Gy TBI 
were highly susceptible to candida challenge, with 100% lethality occurring within 3 d after 
infection, (Fig. 4b, P value vs. control <0.0001 log-rank Mantel-Cox test). In contrast, mice 
conditioned with 3 mg/kg CD45–SAP were considerably more resilient (P value vs. 
irradiation <0.0002 log-rank Mantel-Cox test) with overall survival over 50 d similar to that 
of naive non-conditioned control mice (P value of control vs. CD45–SAP = 0.57 log-rank 
Mantel-Cox test). Therefore, innate immune function was similar to that of control non-
conditioned mice in protection against fungal infection.
Both B and T cells were equally and potently depleted 2 d after conditioning by 3 mg/kg 
CD45–SAP and 5Gy irradiation (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 9a). However, recovery of 
lymphocytes was considerably more rapid in non-transplanted CD45–SAP-treated mice. B 
cells recovered to 80% within 18 d (Supplementary Fig. 9a), and T cells recovered to 70% 
within 12 d (Fig. 4c). In contrast, non-transplanted irradiated mice required 48 d for B and T 
cells to recover to similar levels (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 9a). The faster T-cell 
recovery observed with CD45–SAP may be due to differential effects on the thymus, an 
organ critical for the generation of new T cells, which is typically damaged by TBI 
conditioning36. Histology of thymi 2 d after conditioning in non-transplanted mice 
demonstrated that irradiation induced visible thymic atrophy with considerable reduction of 
thymocyte cellularity in the cortex, whereas no thymic atrophy was evident following 
CD45–SAP conditioning (Fig. 4d). We tested preservation of thymic function by measuring 
the presence of T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs), the molecular signature of T-cell 
receptor rearrangement that does not replicate with genomic DNA and therefore marks 
newly generated T cells. Quantification of TRECs per mg of thymus tissue 3 d after 
conditioning in non-transplanted mice (Fig. 4e) revealed de novo T-cell output following 
CD45–SAP treatment was 84% of normal (P value vs. control = 0.025), whereas 5Gy TBI 
decreased T-cell output to 8% (P value vs. control < 0.0001). Irradiation also reduced thymic 
mass by 80%, whereas CD45–SAP decreased thymic mass by 50% (Supplementary Fig. 9b). 
These data are consistent with relative preservation of T-cell neogenesis after CD45–SAP 
treatment and moderately depleted thymic cellularity.
CD45–SAP (3 mg/kg) did not induce anemia, as red blood cell, hematocrit, and hemoglobin 
levels remained normal, whereas irradiation induced mild anemia 6 d after conditioning 
(Supplementary Fig. 9c–e). Platelets were mildly affected by both conditioning regimens, 
with a decrease to 40% of normal levels (Supplementary Fig. 9f). No observable toxicity 
was observed in the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and ovaries for either CD45–SAP or 
irradiation as assessed by necropsy and histology (data not shown).
Taken together, our results suggest that CD45–SAP conditioning preserves myeloid innate 
immunity, avoids anemia, and facilitates rapid B- and T-lymphocyte recovery versus the 
equivalent conditioning dose of irradiation.

 CD45–SAP enables correction of sickle cell disease
To investigate whether CD45–SAP conditioning could enable curative transplantation in a 
clinically relevant non-malignant hemoglobinopathy model, we used knock-in mice bearing 
the human sickle hemoglobin gene, which mimic human sickle cell disease. These mice 
exhibit decreased red blood cell counts, hematocrit, and hemoglobin levels, with elevated 
numbers of immature red blood cells (reticulocytes) and abnormally large spleens37. 
Previous transplantation studies in sickle mice have shown that 25% myeloid chimerism 
returns blood parameters to 90% of normal and that 70% myeloid chimerism is needed to 
completely correct organ pathophysiology38.
As sickle mice have elevated white blood cell levels (versus wild-type mice), we re-
optimized the dose of CD45–SAP and determined that a single dose of 4 mg/kg at day 0 or 
two sequential doses of 3 mg/kg of CD45–SAP on days 0 and 3 achieved maximal stem cell 
depletion (≈99% immunophenotypic depletion at day 8, Supplementary Fig. 10a) in the 
bone marrow. Using these doses, we investigated three transplantation protocols (groups A–
C; six mice/group) (Fig. 5a). All mice in the three groups (18/18 mice) conditioned with 
CD45–SAP and transplanted with wild-type cells demonstrated >90% donor myeloid 
chimerism at 4 months after transplantation (Fig. 5b). A complete normalization of red 
blood cell, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and reticulocyte levels was also achieved after 
transplantation (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 10b–e).
Sickle hemoglobin protein in the blood was completely replaced with normal hemoglobin 
protein as assessed by native-PAGE analysis (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 10f). In 
addition, blood smears showed a lack of sickle-shaped red blood cells, unlike blood smears 
of sickle control mice (Fig. 5e), and spleen sizes returned to normal (Fig. 5f and 
Supplementary Fig. 10g). Therefore, CD45–SAP conditioning achieves >90% myeloid 
chimerism with full disease correction of sickle cell anemia after transplantation.
DISCUSSION
Current conditioning regimens for HSCT involve varying doses of chemotherapy, either 
alone or in combination with irradiation. These cytotoxic and genotoxic interventions have 
minimal cell selectivity and cause extensive collateral damage to healthy tissue. 
Thrombocytopenia and anemia can be readily treated with platelet or red blood cell 
transfusions9,18, but neutropenia and lymphopenia cannot, leaving patients susceptible to 
severe infection39,40. Of greater concern is genetic injury to non-hematologic and 
hematologic tissues. Acute genetic toxicities to the skin, gut, and airway manifest as hair 
loss, diarrhea, mucositis, and disrupted barrier to infection22,23. Long-term risks include 
such consequences as infertility, stunted skeletal and brain development, and cancer.
Emerging antibody-based conditioning agents are expected to have much less off-target 
toxicity than traditional, non-targeted modes of cell killing. In the best-case scenario, HSC-
specific immunotoxins would selectively deplete HSCs and preserve adaptive and innate 
immunities while avoiding thrombocytopenia, anemia, and damage to hematopoietic 
microenvironments. Previous studies have supported the promise of antibody-based 
conditioning. For example, ACK2, an anti-CD117 naked antagonist antibody, enabled

 autologous transplantation in immunocompromised mice25. However, high-dose ACK2 
failed to condition immunocompetent adult mice and induced anemia, neutropenia, and 
thrombocytopenia41. Although some efficacy was observed in fetal mice42, ACK2 required 
combination with sub-lethal irradiation to achieve meaningful chimerism in adult 
immunocompetent mice26 and this combination showed modest efficacy in non-human 
primates43. In addition, CD117 is expressed on cardiac progenitors, gastrointestinal cells, 
neuronal cells, and cells of the reproductive system, raising concerns about potential off-
target toxicity44.
We chose the antibody target CD45 on the basis of our results from an in vivo screen of 
seven hematopoietic markers. CD45 is expressed exclusively by all hematopoietic cells with 
the exception of platelets and erythrocytes45. Anti-CD45 radioimmunotherapy is currently 
under clinical investigation as a myeloablative alternative to conventional conditioning in 
patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. However, a major 
concern with this agent is bystander toxicity, whereby non-target cells, particularly those in 
the bone marrow and thymus, are affected by irradiation owing to their close proximity to 
target cells. Similar to conventional conditioning, anti-CD45 radioimmunotherapy induces 
neutropenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia46,47, and damage to the bone marrow 
microenvironment is highly likely. Naked antibodies targeting CD45 have also been tested 
for conditioning in HSCT. However, they depleted only lymphoid cells (perhaps through 
complement-dependent cytotoxicity), and additional DNA-targeting chemotherapy was 
required to deplete HSCs48,49; such combinations have been tested in human transplantation 
but required genotoxins for efficacy50.
In contrast, our study demonstrates that single-entity targeting of CD45 using a protein-
based immunotoxin achieves HSC depletion in fully immunocompetent mice and enables 
transplantation while avoiding neutropenia, anemia, and thymopoietic damage. The 
requirement for receptor-mediated internalization of CD45–SAP to achieve cell killing 
limits the risks of off-target and bystander toxicity. CD45–SAP promoted rapid marrow and 
peripheral lymphocyte regeneration, at least in part by avoiding toxicity to non-target niche 
cells. We successfully used CD45–SAP to condition sickle disease mice and demonstrated 
full disease correction after transplantation. These results suggest that protein-based 
immunotoxins may be preferred for non-malignant conditions in which stable mixed 
chimerism is sufficient to cure the underlying disease (e.g., hemoglobinopathies and SCID 
conditions). Additionally, the enhanced stability and cost-effective production of protein-
based immunotoxins compared to radioimmunotherapy may facilitate their widespread use. 
Finally, as protein-based immunotoxins such as CD45–SAP do not induce DNA damage, 
they may be better suited to condition pre-malignant Fanconi anemia patients, who are 
genetically predisposed to be hypersensitive to DNA damaging agents and conventional 
conditioning51.
The impact of CD45–SAP on HSCs was markedly different than on progenitors, as 
demonstrated by flow cytometry and colony-forming capacity (Fig. 3 and Supplementary 
Fig. 5). However, expression of the CD45 antigen on the surface of HSCs and various 
progenitor populations did not closely correlate with relative sensitivity to CD45–SAP in our 
hands (Supplementary Fig. 11), a result that may be explained by cell-specific differential

 processing of antibody-engaged CD45. Future studies will explore the dependence of 
internalization kinetics and subsequent processing on cell differentiation state.
The experiments described in this study are relevant to autologous HSCT, and further 
experimentation is required to determine the utility of CD45 immunotoxins in allogeneic 
transplantation. It is conceivable that other targets, including those investigated in our initial 
screen, may enable efficient conditioning upon further optimization and that our approach 
may lead to HSC-specific immunotoxins that completely preserve immunity while enabling 
autologous HSCT. Toward this goal, this study offers several considerations. As HSCs are 
predominantly in a quiescent non-dividing state52, it will be of interest to determine whether 
toxins that inhibit protein synthesis (e.g., SAP, modified ricin analogs, pseudomonas, or 
diphtheria toxin) are particularly effective for HSC depletion as they induce death 
independent of the cell cycle53, in contrast to anti-mitotic small molecules currently used in 
antibody-drug conjugates54. Although a previous study suggested that CD45 would be an 
unsuitable target for internalizing immunotoxins due to its poor internalization frequency55, 
we observed that 12% internalization (measured over a 24 h period in vitro, Fig. 1e) is 
sufficient to achieve potent HSC depletion with in vivo utility. As CD45 is highly expressed 
at 200,000 molecules per leukocyte56, the absolute number of internalized molecules, rather 
than internalization frequency alone, likely determines target suitability. Furthermore, in 
addition to favorable in vivo persistence, high-affinity immunotoxins that minimize shedding 
and undesirable targeting of donor cells may be required to achieve a wide transplantation 
window.
In cancer therapy, the clinical utility of immunotoxins has been limited by issues of 
immunogenicity and cumulative dose-limiting toxicity57. These factors may be less relevant 
to pre-HSCT conditioning, which will likely require limited administration of immunotoxin. 
Furthermore, the wealth of safety data available from previous immunotoxin clinical trials 
for hematological malignancies may facilitate clinical translation of immunotoxins for 
conditioning. Taken together, our results indicate that CD45–SAP or similar protein-based 
immunotoxins may benefit patients undergoing autologous HSCT by minimizing the 
toxicities of conditioning regimens.
To deliver on the promise of this approach to patient care, it obviously must be effective 
against human cells. We have begun testing antibodies against human CD45 on human 
hematopoietic cell lines. Two such antibodies were capable of potently inducing cell death 
with IC50 values of 130 and 200 pM (Supplementary Fig. 12), demonstrating that anti-CD45 
antibody internalization is not species-specific.

 ONLINE METHODS
General methods and statistics
Sample sizes for animal studies (typically n = 5 mice/group within each experiment) were 
based on prior similar work without the use of additional statistical estimations. All statistics 
were calculated using unpaired Student t-test using two-sided analysis except Kaplan-Meier 
data, which were analyzed by log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Alphanumeric coding was used to 
blind pathology samples and CFC counting.
Animal studies
All animal studies were performed with Harvard faculty of arts and sciences (FAS) or 
Massachusetts General Hospital IACUC approval. Wild-type CD45.2 mice (C57BL/6J and 
BALB/cByJ), congenic CD45.1 mice (B6.SJL-Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ and CByJ.SJL(B6)-
Ptprca/J), GFP mice (CByJ. B6-Tg(UBC-GFP)30Scha/J), and sickle mice (B6;129-
Hbatm1(HBA)Tow Hbbtm2(HBG1,HBB*)Tow/Hbbtm3(HBG1,HBB)Tow/J were purchased 
from Jackson Laboratories. Female mice were used for all experiments at approximately 7–9 
weeks of age, unless stated otherwise. All mice within each experiment were age-matched 
and no randomization was performed. Pre-established criterion for animal omission was 
failure to inject >90% of desired immunotoxin/cell dose. Health concerns unrelated to the 
procedure (e.g., malocclusion, severe dermatitis) were criteria for omission and euthanasia. 
For sickle experiments, sickle chimeras were created by transplanting lethally irradiated 
(9.5Gy single dose, cesium-137 irradiator, JL Shephard & Associates) 6-week-old 
C57BL/6J mice with 5 million bone marrow (BM) cells harvested from sickle mice. 
Immunotoxin conditioning and transplantation in sickle chimeras were performed 8 weeks 
after chimera creation.
Antibodies and immunotoxin preparation
Biotinylated anti-CD45 (clones 30-F11 and HI30)49,58, anti-CD45.2 (clone 104)59, anti-
CD49d (clones 9C10)60, and anti-CD84 (clone mCD84.7)61 monoclonal antibodies were 
purchased from BioLegend. Biotinylated anti-CD90 (clone 30-H12)62, anti-CD133 (clone 
13A4)63, anti-CD184 (clone 2B11)64, and anti-CD135 (clone A2F10)65 monoclonal 
antibodies were purchased from eBioscience. Biotinylated anti-CD45 (clone MEM-28)66 
monoclonal antibody was purchased from Novus Biologicals. Anti-CD117 antagonist 
antibody (clone ACK2)25 was purchased from BioLegend and injected at 28 mg/kg. 
Immunotoxins were prepared by combining biotinylated antibodies (160 kDa MW) with 
streptavidin–SAP conjugate (2.8 saporin molecules per streptavidin, 135 kDa MW, 
Advanced Targeting Systems) in a 1:1 molar ratio and subsequently diluted in PBS 
immediately before use. Dose calculations assumed a combined molecular weight of 295 
kDa for the immunotoxins. In vivo administration of immunotoxin was performed by 
intravenous injections (300 μL volume).
In vitro cell death assay
In vitro cell death experiments were performed using EL4 (ATCC TIB-39), EML (ATCC 
CRL-11691) and Jurkat (clone E6-1, ATCC TIB-152) cell lines. The morphology, growth

 kinetics, and immunophenotype (e.g., EL4 and EML by mouse CD45 expression; EML by 
murine stem cell factor-dependent growth; and Jurkat by human CD45 and CD3 expression) 
of the cell lines were consistent with established parameters and mycoplasma testing was not 
performed. Jurkat cells were confirmed to express human CD45. Cells were plated in 96-
well plates with 5,000 cells/well in 100 μL volume cell culture media containing various 
concentrations of immunotoxin. Three independent experiments were performed with three 
technical replicates within each experiment. After 72 h, cell viability was determined using 
the CellTiter MTS assay (Promega). PBS-treated and 10 μM staurosporine-treated cells 
(Sigma-Aldrich) were used as live and dead controls, respectively.
Measurement of antibody internalization
In vitro antibody internalization was assessed as previously described67. Briefly, EL4 cells 
(200,000/mL) in complete media (RPMI w/o phenol red, 10% FBS) were plated into 96-well 
plates with 20 nM AF488-labeled anti-CD45.2 antibody (clone 104, BioLegend) or a 1:1 
mixture of biotinylated anti-CD45.2 antibody and streptavidin-AF488 conjugate (Life 
Technologies) with n = 6 technical replicates. After 24 h of incubation, the cells were 
washed twice and resuspended in PBS containing 2% FBS. Samples were split into two and 
one-half was incubated with 0.25 mg/mL polyclonal anti-AF488 quenching antibody (clone 
A-11094, Life Technologies). AF488 signal in samples with and without quenching 
antibody was quantitated by flow cytometry. Unstained and time zero controls were 
performed to determine the quenching efficiency and calculate internalization frequency.
In vivo antibody persistence
C57BL/6 mice were i.v. injected with streptavidin-AF488 conjugate premixed with 
biotinylated anti-CD45 antibody (1:1 ratio in PBS, 1.8 mg/kg). Twenty-four hours after 
administration, blood, BM, and spleen were harvested and AF488 signal determined by flow 
cytometry. BM cells were stained with lineage cocktail (BD Biosciences), anti-cKit and anti-
Sca1 antibodies in order to determine AF488 signal within the Lin−cKit+Sca1+ (LKS) 
progenitor population. AF488 signal in splenocytes and peripheral blood cells was assessed 
within the CD45+ cell fraction following ex vivo staining with anti-CD45 PeCy7 antibody.
BM analysis and transplantation
BM cells for transplantation or analysis were harvested by crushing all limbs or one femur, 
respectively. Total cellularity was determined by complete blood cell counting (CBC) 
analysis, using an Abaxis VetScan HM5 instrument. Progenitor colony assays were 
performed following manufacturer’s instructions (Stem Cell Technologies). 
Immunophenotypic cKit, anti-Sca1, anti-CD48, and anti-CD150 antibodies and stem cells 
were defined as Lin−cKit+Sca1+CD48−CD150+. For non-hematopoietic cell analysis, 
flushed bone marrow plugs from long bones were digested using 2 mg/ml dispase and 1 
mg/ml collagenase IV enzymatic cocktail in Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS) for 2 × 
15 min cycle at 37 °C. Flushed bones were then crushed, cut into small pieces and digested 
with 0.25% collagenase (1 h 37 °C) with shaking. Endothelial and stromal populations in the 
marrow and collagenase fractions were defined by flow cytometry using CD45-Ter119-
CD31+ and CD45−Ter119−CD31− gating, respectively. Anti-CD45 mAb (clone 30-F11) was 
used for cytometry analysis to avoid potential interference from CD45–SAP (created from

 anti-CD45.2 mAb clone 104). For BM transplants, 10 million cells in 300 μL PBS were 
injected intravenously. For purified stem cells injections, BM cells were lineage depleted by 
magnetic selection (BD Biosciences) before FACS sorting of LKS CD48−CD150+ or LKS 
CD34−CD150+ cells. Two thousand purified stem cells were injected per mouse. Secondary 
transplants were performed by injecting 1 million BM cells from primary conditioned and 
transplanted mice (4 months after transplantation) and injected into secondary lethally 
irradiated recipients (9.5Gy single dose). Competitive transplants were performed by 
injecting 1 million BM cells containing a 1:1 ratio of CD45.1 competitor and CD45.2 test 
cells into lethally irradiated (9.5Gy single dose) congenic CD45.1 recipients.
Peripheral blood analysis
Cohorts of mice (typically 4 mice/group) were serially bled or terminally bled by cardiac 
bleed. White blood cell, hemoglobin, red blood cell, platelet, and hematocrit levels were 
quantified by CBC analysis (Abaxis VetScan HM5). For flow cytometry quantification of T, 
B, and myeloid cells, blood samples were red blood cell–lysed and fixed before staining 
with anti-CD45, -B220, -CD3, -Mac1, and -Gr1 antibodies and absolute numbers of T, B, 
and myeloid cells were calculated using flow cytometry frequencies and white blood cell 
values obtained by CBC analysis. Peripheral blood donor chimerism was determined by 
flow cytometry using anti-CD45.1 and CD45.2 antibodies for transplants involving CD45.1 
donor cells. For transplants using CD45.2–GFP donor cells, chimerism was based on GFP+ 
events within the CD45+ gate. Reticulocyte frequency within the red blood cell population 
was determined by flow cytometry using thiazole orange staining (Retic-COUNT reagent, 
BD Biosciences). Native-PAGE analysis of hemoglobin protein was performed on any-kD 
precast gels (Bio-Rad) using lysed whole blood samples.
Pathology and histology
At various time points (2, 4, 6, and 8 d after conditioning) C57BL/6 mice were euthanized, 
fixed in Bouin’s solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and submitted for necropsy and histology. Two 
independent experiments were performed with 1 mouse/group. Hematoxylin and eosin 
staining was performed on paraffin embedded sections of the liver, spleen, femur, kidney, 
intestinal tract, lymph nodes, thymus, and ovaries for assessment of toxicity. Representative 
images shown are consistent between the two independent experiments.
Intravital imaging of vascular integrity
Live imaging of the mouse calvarial BM vasculature of conditioned C57BL/6 mice (2 d after 
conditioning) or non-treated control mice was performed using a custom made multi-photon 
microscope68 (Thorlabs, Inc.) incorporating a high pulse energy fiber-based femtosecond 
laser (Cazadero FLCPA, Calmar laser) with excitation wavelengths set at 775 and 950 nm. A 
water-immersed 60×/1.00w objective (LUMPLFLN60XW, Olympus) provided a 415 × 415 
μm field of view and 0.5–5 μm Z-steps were use to a depth of 150–200 μm. Mice were 
maintained under anesthesia (1.35% isoflurane/oxygen mixture) and body core temperature 
was maintained using a warmed plate. A U-shaped incision on the scalp exposed the 
calvarium bone, to which 2% methocellulose gel was applied for refractive index matching. 
Second harmonic generation signal (excited at 387.5 nm) was used to visualize bone 
collagen and to determine a region of interest. On-stage retro-orbital injection of 2 MDa

 rhodamine-dextran conjugate (150 μL of 3.3 mg/mL D-7139, Life Technologies) was 
performed and rhodamine signal (585 nm excitation) was continuously recorded (13 frames/
second) for the first 2–5 min after injection. Serial images were collected up to 30 min after 
injection. Images taken at similar times after rhodamine-dextran administration were used 
for comparison between groups and two independent experiments were performed with 1 
mouse/group/experiment. Contrast and brightness settings of the images in the figures were 
adjusted for display purposes only.
Systemic challenge with candida albicans
Candida albicans, wild-type stain SC5314 (ATCC MYA-2876), was grown overnight from 
frozen stocks in yeast extract, peptone, and dextrose (YPD) medium (BD Biosciences) with 
100 μg/mL ampicillin (Sigma) in an orbital shaker at 30 °C. After pelleting and washing 
with cold PBS, yeast were counted using a hemocytometer and cell density adjusted in PBS 
to 75,000 CFUs per 200 μL. C57BL/6 mice (non-conditioned control or 2 d post 3 mg/kg 
CD45–SAP or 5Gy TBI) were injected via lateral tail vein with 75,000 CFUs and animals 
were monitored daily. Moribund mice were euthanized humanely.
Quantification of thymic T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs)
TREC quantification was performed as previously described69. Briefly, thymi were 
harvested from non-conditioned C57BL/6 mice, 5Gy TBI or 3 mg/kg CD45–SAP 
conditioned mice (3 d after conditioning). Total DNA was extracted using TRIZOL 
following tissue homogenization in a Bullet Blender Storm BBX24 instrument (Next 
Advance, Inc.). DNA was quantified by UV-Vis and 1 μg of DNA per sample was used as 
input for real-time PCR. A standard curve of mouse sjTREC plasmid was used to calculate 
the absolute number of single joint TRECS (sjTRECs) per sample.

CD45–SAP has potent cell-depletion activity. (a) Experimental outline for assessing ability 
of immunotoxins to deplete HSCs in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice. HSCs were 
assessed by flow cytometry (Lin−cKit+Sca1+CD48−CD150+) and progenitor colony forming 
cells (CFCs) were assessed by colony forming assay. (b) Dose-dependent effects of CD45–
SAP on HSCs and CFCs, assessed 8 d after administration in C57BL/6 mice. Non-treated 
mice served as the control. Data represent mean ± s.d. (n = 30 mice, 5 mice/group, assayed 
individually); all data points significant vs. control (P > 0.05). (c) CD45–SAP depletes HSCs 
in C57BL/6 mice whereas non-biotinylated CD45 antibody in the presence of streptavidin–
SAP does not. Data represent mean ± s.d. (n = 5 mice/group, one of two independent 
experiments shown). (d) CD45–SAP clone 104 kills EML progenitor cells in vitro (72 h 
incubation) whereas non-biotinylated antibody in the presence of streptavidin–SAP does not 
affect cell viability. Data represent mean ± s.d. (n = 3 technical replicates) of one of three 
independent experiments. (e) Percent internalization of clone 104 antibody (Ab alone) or 
antibody–streptavidin complex (Ab–streptavidin) in EL4 cells over 24 h in vitro culture. 
Data represent mean ± s.d. of a single experiment with n = 6 replicates. *P < 0.05; **P < 
0.01; ***P < 0.001; n.s., not significant (P > 0.05). Statistics calculated using unpaired t test.
