Abstract
Biological aging measures have been proposed as proxies for extension of healthy life span in trials of geroprotective therapies that aim to 
slow aging. Several methods to measure biological aging show promise but it is not known if these methods are sensitive to changes caused by 
geroprotective therapy. We conducted analysis of two proposed methods to quantify biological aging using data from a recently concluded trial 
of an established geroprotector, caloric restriction. We obtained data from the National Institute on Aging CALERIE randomized trial through 
its public-access biobank (https://calerie.duke.edu/). The CALERIE trial randomized N = 220 nonobese adults to 25% caloric restriction 
(n = 145; 11.7% caloric restriction was achieved, on average) or to maintain current diet (n = 75) for 2 years. We analyzed biomarker data 
collected at baseline, 12-, and 24-month follow-up assessments. We applied published biomarker algorithms to these data to calculate two 
biological age measures, Klemera–Doubal Method Biological Age and homeostatic dysregulation. Intent-to-treat analysis using mixed-effects 
growth models of within-person change over time tested if caloric restriction slowed increase in measures of biological aging across follow-up. 
Analyses of both measures indicated caloric restriction slowed biological aging. Weight loss did not account for the observed effects. Results 
suggest future directions for testing of geroprotective therapies in humans.
Keywords: Caloric restriction—Biological age—Geroscience—Geroprotector
Population aging threatens a rising tide of disease and disability 
(1). The new field of geroscience aims to respond to this challenge 
by devising therapies to extend healthy life years (2,3). Several such 
“geroprotective” therapies are poised for proof-of-concept testing 
in humans (4). But there is not yet consensus about how proof-of-
concept tests should be conducted (5). Extension of healthy life span 
is a challenging outcome metric for human trials because of cost and 
other impracticalities of extended follow-up. Proposed measures of 
so-called “biological aging” may provide a surrogate—a measure that 
can be tracked over relatively short duration of follow-up and whose 
response to geroprotective therapy can serve as a proxy for extension 
of healthy life span.
Biological aging refers to the gradual and progressive decline in the 
integrity of the body’s systems occurring with advancing chronologi-
cal age (6,7). Rather than any specific disease process, this decline in 
system integrity is thought to reflect biological changes having their 
origins in aging itself (3,8). Whereas chronological age increases at the 
same rate for everyone, biological age can increase faster for some and 
slower for others. To the extent that geroprotective therapies modify 
basic biological processes of aging, their effects should be reflected in 
a slowed rate of decline in system integrity—slowed biological aging.
Recently, several methods have been proposed to quantify biologi-
cal aging using algorithms that combine information from multiple bio-
markers (9–13). These algorithms integrate information from multiple

 organ systems in the body to produce a single composite measure of 
system integrity. The underlying hypothesis is that, among individu-
als of the same chronological age, a difference in measured biological 
aging reflects differences in risk for age-related disease, disability, and 
death. In observational studies of biological aging measures, people 
with “slower” biological aging have lower risk for morbidity, disability, 
and mortality (14–18). However, it is not known if measured biological 
aging can be modified by geroprotective therapy.
Caloric restriction is among the oldest and most effective gero-
protective interventions in worms, flies, and mice (19). Growing 
evidence suggests caloric restriction also benefits life span and 
healthspan in primates and humans (20–22). A unique resource 
to study effects of caloric restriction in humans is the National 
Institute on Aging 2-year randomized controlled trial of caloric 
restriction in young, non-obese healthy humans, Comprehensive 
Assessment of the Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy 
(CALERIE) (23). CALERIE data are now publicly available (https://
calerie.duke.edu/). These data provide a resource to characterize 
potential geroprotective effects of caloric restriction (24). They also 
provide the opportunity to develop and refine methods that can be 
generalized to tests of other geroprotective interventions.
We analyzed CALERIE Biobank data to test whether recently 
proposed methods to quantify biological aging would prove sensi-
tive to geroprotective effects of caloric restriction over the relatively 
short, 2-year span of the human trial. The hypothesis was that cal-
oric restriction would slow the rate of change in measured biological 
age. We conducted intent-to-treat analysis using two different meas-
ures of biological aging implementable with data already existing 
within the CALERIE Biobank: the Klemera–Doubal method (KDM) 
Biological Age (25,26) and homeostatic dysregulation (11,15). 
Algorithms were applied to measures of serum albumin, alkaline 
phosphatase, C-reactive protein, total cholesterol, creatinine, gly-
cated hemoglobin (estimated from serum glucose), systolic blood 
pressure, urea nitrogen, uric acid, and white blood cell count. KDM 
Biological age and homeostatic dysregulation algorithms have not 
been studied before in the CALERIE trial, although some data used 
to compute the algorithms were reported previously (23). The ana-
lysis we report below evaluates effects of the CALERIE intervention 
on composite measures of aging-related changes in organ-system 
function and provides a proof-of-concept test for using biological 
aging algorithms as outcome measures in geroprotector trials.
Method
CALERIE
The CALERIE trial is described in detail elsewhere (23,27,28). 
Briefly, N = 220 normal-weight (22.0 ≤ BMI < 28 kg/m2) partici-
pants (70% female, 77% White) aged 21–50 years at baseline were 
randomized to caloric restriction or ad libitum conditions with a 
2:1 ratio (n = 145 to caloric restriction, n = 75 to ad libitum). “Ad 
libitum” (normal) caloric intake was determined from two con-
secutive 14-day assessments of total daily energy expenditure using 
doubly labeled water (29). Average percent caloric restriction over 
6-month intervals was retrospectively calculated by the intake-bal-
ance method with simultaneous measurements of total daily energy 
expenditure using doubly labeled water and changes in body com-
position (30,31). Over the course of the trial, participants in the 
caloric-restriction arm averaged 12% reduction in caloric intake 
(about half the prescribed reduction). Participants in the ad libitum 
condition reduced caloric intake by <2% (23). Additional details 
about CALERIE are reported in the Supplementary Materials.
Biobank Data
We obtained publicly available biomarker data from the CALERIE 
Biobank website (https://calerie.duke.edu/apply-samples-and-data-
analysis). Of the N = 220 CALERIE participants with baseline 
biomarker data to quantify biological aging, 200 and 191 also 
provided necessary data at the 12- and 24-month follow-up time 
points, respectively; 92% of ad libitum-arm participants and 83% 
of caloric-restriction-arm participants provided necessary data at all 
three time points.
Measures of Biological Age
Calculating human biological age is a relatively recent enterprise 
(32) and there is disagreement about methods (33). Our goal was 
to borrow and implement validated methods using available data. 
A recent comparison of five different biological age algorithms as 
predictors of mortality across 20 years of follow-up identified the 
Klemera–Doubal method (25) as performing the best: consistent 
with results from other studies (25,34), it predicted mortality; did 
so better than chronological age; and accounted for the association 
between chronological age and mortality (14). Although this method 
is imperfect (26), it can be implemented in young, healthy adults, 
and is associated with functional outcomes in this younger popula-
tion (12,35). The Klemera–Doubal method has been criticized for 
including chronological age information (36). Therefore, to evaluate 
the robustness of findings, we also measured biological age using the 
homeostatic dysregulation method (11,15), which does not include 
information about chronological age.
Klemera–Doubal Method Biological Age Algorithm
Following the approach described by Levine (10), we calculated 
CALERIE participants’ biological ages using the Klemera–Doubal 
equation (25). The equation takes information from m number of 
regression lines of chronological age regressed on m biomarkers:

where x is the value of biomarker j measured for an individual in 
the CALERIE trial. To ensure independence of the Klemera–Doubal 
Biological Age algorithm from the CALERIE database, we esti-
mated all algorithm parameters from a reference data set. We used 
the 2007–2008 and 2009–2010 panels of the U.S. National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey to match the assessment period 
of the CALERIE trial. For each biomarker j, the parameters k, q, 
and s were estimated from a regression of chronological age on the 
biomarker in the reference data set. k, q, and s, are the regression 
intercept, slope, and root mean squared error, respectively. sBA is a 
scaling factor equal to the square root of the variance in chrono-
logical age explained by the biomarker panel in the reference data-
base. CA is chronological age. The biomarkers from the CALERIE 
database were: serum albumin, alkaline phosphatase, C-reactive 
protein, total cholesterol, creatinine, glycated hemoglobin (esti-
mated from serum glucose), systolic blood pressure, urea nitrogen, 
uric acid, and white blood cell count. This biomarker set departed 
in two cases from previous analysis (10,12,14,37). The CALERIE 
protocol did not measure lung function or cytomegalovirus anti-
body. Instead, we included white blood cell count and uric acid 
plasma concentration, which are related to immune and kidney 
function, show prospective relationships with mortality (38,39),

 and were measured in both CALERIE and the NHANES. We report 
sensitivity analyses in the supplement in which algorithms are com-
puted excluding these additional markers. Following Levine (10), 
regressions of chronological age on biomarker values included all 
NHANES participants aged 30–75 years, not pregnant, and with 
complete biomarker data (n = 7,694). Biomarkers with skewed 
distributions were log-transformed for analysis. Models were esti-
mated separately for men and women. For each biomarker, model 
R-squared, root-mean-squared-error, intercept, and age-coefficient 
were saved (Supplementary Table 1, Panel A). These parameters 
were used to form the Klemera–Doubal Biological Age algorithm 
in our study.
Homeostatic dysregulation algorithm
We calculated CALERIE participants’ homeostatic dysregulation 
using the approach described by Cohen and colleagues (15,40). 
Homeostatic dysregulation quantifies deviation of a person’s physi-
ology from a reference norm based on biomarker Mahalanobis 
distance (41). We computed parameters for the homeostatic dys-
regulation algorithm based on the same ten biomarkers used to 
calculate the Klemera–Doubal Biological Age algorithm. We 
formed the reference norm from young, healthy NHANES par-
ticipants: NHANES 2007–2008 and 2009–2010 participants aged 
20–30 years who were not obese and whose biomarker values 
fell within the age- and sex-specific normal range (42) (N = 689). 
We standardized all biomarkers to have mean = 0, SD = 1 within 
sex and computed the biomarker variance-covariance matrix 
(Supplementary Table 1, Panel B). This matrix, together with the 
Mahalanobis distance equation (41) formed the homeostatic dys-
regulation algorithm.
Biological aging measures in NHANES
We conducted analysis of the two biological age algorithms in 
independent NHANES data not used for algorithm development 
(Supplementary Information). Both algorithms were (a) correlated 
with chronological age (r = 0.92 for KDM Biological Age, r = 0.41 
for homeostatic dysregulation); (b) associated with physical limita-
tions independent of chronological age (r = 0.34 for KDM Biological 
Age, r = 0.16 for homeostatic dysregulation); and (c) indicated accel-
erated aging in a socially disadvantaged population (low educational 
attainment predicted a b = 1.56 95% CI [95% CI 1.09, 2.03] “year” 
acceleration of KDM Biological Age and b = 0.31 [95% CI 0.25, 
0.37] standard deviation increase in homeostatic dysregulation inde-
pendent of chronological age). Details of analyses are reported in the 
Supplementary Information.
Calculation of biological aging measures in CALERIE
We applied KDM Biological Age and homeostatic dysregulation algo-
rithms to CALERIE participants’ biomarker data. Biomarker data 
came from blood collected at baseline, 12-month, and 24-month fol-
low-up visits (baseline n = 220, 12-month n = 200, 24-month n = 191). 
Details on CALERIE Biobank data are reported in Supplementary 
Table 2. Glycated hemoglobin (%) was estimated from serum glucose 
using the equation HbA1C = (glucose+46.7)/28.7 (43). Alkaline phos-
phatase, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, high sensitivity C-reactive 
protein, HbA1C, and uric acid were log transformed for analysis. 
KDM Biological age was computed directly from the biomarker val-
ues. To compute homeostatic dysregulation, biomarker values were 
standardized to have mean and standard deviation equal to one based 
on sex-specific distributions in the NHANES reference sample.
Missing data
Of a total 6,110 possible biomarker observations (10 biomarkers 
× 611 observations), 6,084 (>99%) were available in the CALERIE 
Biobank database. For individuals who participated in baseline, 
12- and 24-month assessments, missing biomarker values from a 
single assessment were imputed as linear combinations of observed 
values from the other two assessments. In the case of six observa-
tions, missing biomarker values could not be imputed. KDM bio-
logical age values for these observations were pro-rated to account 
for missing data. Homeostatic dysregulation values could not be 
calculated, and values for these six observations were coded as 
missing.
Analysis
We conducted intent-to-treat analysis to test the hypothesis that cal-
oric restriction would slow the rate of biological aging. We tested if 
randomization to the caloric-restriction arm of the CALERIE trial 
was associated with slowed biological aging using a mixed-effects 
growth model (44). The model included main effect terms for fol-
low-up time and treatment arm, an interaction term testing differ-
ential effect of follow-up time by treatment arm, and covariates for 
chronological age at baseline and sex. The model took the form

where ΔBio Ageit is change in the biological age measure from base-
line for individual “I” at time “t,” γ1 estimates annual change in bio-
logical age for ad libitum-arm participants, γ2 estimates any baseline 
difference in biological age between participants in ad libitum and 
caloric-restriction arms of the trial, γ3 estimates the difference in 
annual change in biological age between ad libitum-arm and cal-
oric restriction-arm participants, χ is a vector of covariates, and μ0i 
and μ1i are the “random” intercepts and slopes estimated for each 
individual “i.” The coefficient γ3 tests the hypothesis that biological 
aging was slowed for participants randomized to the caloric-restric-
tion arm of the trial. All models included sex and baseline age as 
covariates. Growth-model analysis included 611 observations of 
220 individuals.
We also evaluated whether participants who achieved a higher 
“dose” of caloric restriction exhibited a stronger “response” in 
terms of more pronounced slowing in their rate of biological aging. 
CALERIE participants were not blind to their intervention condi-
tion and were active participants in their own “dosing;” i.e., partic-
ipants’ behavior influenced their degree of caloric restriction. For 
this reason, even though treatment condition (caloric-restriction vs. 
ad libitum) was randomly assigned, the dose of caloric restriction 
achieved by participants in the treatment arm could vary system-
atically with their rate of biological aging prior to the start of the 
trial. We compared biological aging in CALERIE participants in 
the ad libitum condition to two subgroups of caloric-restriction-
arm participants: those who achieved less than 10% caloric restric-
tion on average across the 12- and 24-month follow-up periods 
and those who achieved 10% or more caloric restriction during 
these periods. Subjects were not randomized to <10/≥10% adher-
ence and thus may differ across a range of values possibly related 
to both level of CR attained and biological aging. The analysis of 
dose–response effects shown are therefore purely exploratory in 
nature and intended to provide hypothesis generation rather than 
confirmatory evidence.

 Results
Baseline
CALERIE participants’ chronological and Klemera–Doubal method 
(KDM) Biological Ages were correlated (r = 0.88, Figure 1). At base-
line, there was no difference in KDM Biological Age between caloric 
restriction and ad libitum arms of the CALERIE trial (p value for 
difference = .777). Participants’ biological ages were slightly younger 
than their chronological ages. Mean chronological age at baseline 
among CALERIE participants was 38 years (SD = 7). Mean KDM 
Biological Age was 37 years (SD = 7). This difference may reflect: 
the sampling frames used for CALERIE and the NHANES; vol-
unteer bias; and that CALERIE participants were selected to be in 
good health, whereas the NHANES sample used to estimate KDM 
Biological Age parameters represented the general population.
Longitudinal Change
Across follow-up, CALERIE participants randomized to the trial’s 
caloric restriction arm experienced slower biological aging as com-
pared to participants randomized to the ad libitum arm (treatment-
by-time interaction: b = −0.60 (95% CI −0.99, −0.21), p = .003). 
Average change from baseline in KDM Biological Age is plotted 
for ad libitum- and caloric-restriction-arm participants in Figure 2. 
CALERIE participants randomized to the ad libitum arm of the trial 
experienced average increase in KDM Biological Age of 0.71 “years” 
per 12-month follow-up (95% CI 0.41, 1.01). For participants ran-
domized to caloric restriction, KDM Biological Age increased more 
slowly, by an average of 0.11 (95% CI −0.13, 0.36) “years” per 
12-month follow-up interval. This change was not statistically dif-
ferent from zero (p = .353), indicating slowed biological aging in 
caloric-restriction-arm participants. Growth model coefficients are 
reported in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 3.
Association With Weight Loss
The slowed pace of biological aging among CALERIE participants 
randomized to the caloric-restriction arm was not accounted for by 
weight loss during the intervention. CALERIE participants in the 
caloric-restriction arm of the trial experienced significant weight loss 
relative to those in the ad libitum arm (23). We tested if the slower 
pace of biological aging observed among participants in the caloric-
restriction arm could be attributed to this weight loss. We repeated 
growth-model analysis, including weight as a time-varying covari-
ate. Independent of weight loss, caloric-restriction arm participants 
experienced slower biological aging as compared to ad libitum-arm 
participants (weight-loss adjusted treatment-by-time interaction 
b = −0.55 (95% CI −0.95, −0.16), p = .006).
Dose Response
Slowed pace of biological aging among CALERIE participants ran-
domized to the caloric-restriction arm was greater (i.e., slowed by 
a larger degree) for participants who achieved more caloric restric-
tion. The degree of caloric restriction varied across participants 
(Supplementary Figure 2). We divided the n = 130 caloric restriction-
arm participants who attended follow-up assessments into those 
who failed to achieve an average 10% caloric restriction across 
follow-ups (n = 66) and those who achieved 10% or greater cal-
oric restriction (n = 62). Visit-specific caloric restriction information 
was unavailable for n = 2 participants. We then repeated our ana-
lysis. Both groups of caloric restriction arm participants experienced 
slowed biological aging relative to ad libitum-arm participants (for 
the <10% group, b = −0.49 [95% CI −0.95, −0.04]; for the ≥10% 
group, b = −0.72 [95% CI −1.19, −0.25]; Supplementary Figure 3). 
However, although the pattern of effect-sizes was consistent with 
a dose–response relationship, the difference in effect between the 
<10% and ≥10% groups was not statistically significant (p = .361). 
Growth model coefficients are reported in Supplementary Table 5.
Replication With Homeostatic Dysregulation
We repeated analysis, this time using homeostatic dysregulation to 
index biological aging. Replication of analysis using homeostatic 
dysregulation in place of KDM Biological Age yielded similar results. 
At baseline, homeostatic dysregulation had mean (SD) of 3.44 (0.42), 
was positively correlated with CALERIE participants’ chronological 
ages (r = 0.12), and was not different between treatment and ad lib-
itum arms of the trial (p = .815). Across follow-up, caloric-restriction 
arm participants experienced slower biological aging compared to 
ad libitum-arm participants as measured by homeostatic dysregula-
tion (treatment-by-time interaction b = -0.07 [95% CI −0.12, −0.01], 
p = .014). Homeostatic dysregulation was unchanged across follow-
up among ad libitum-arm CALERIE participants (b = 0.01 units per 
12-month follow-up [95% CI −0.03, 0.06], p = .644). In contrast, 
homeostatic dysregulation declined by −0.05 (95% CI −0.08, −0.02) 
units among caloric restriction-arm participants (p < .001). Slower 
biological aging in caloric restriction-arm participants compared to 
ad libitum-arm participants as measured by homeostatic dysregu-
lation was not accounted for by weight-loss (weight loss adjusted 
treatment-by-follow-up-time interaction b = −0.07 (95% CI −0.12, 
−0.01), p = .020). Within the caloric restriction arm, there were no 
dose effects observed (p = .470). Homeostatic dysregulation growth 
model coefficients are reported in Supplementary Tables 4 and 5.
Discussion
We conducted intent-to-treat analysis of the CALERIE randomized 
trial to test if caloric restriction slowed biological aging over the 
course of a 2-year intervention. Tests using two different methods to 
quantify biological aging (Klemera–Doubal method Biological Age 
Figure 1. CALERIE participants’ KDM Biological Ages were highly correlated 
with their chronological ages at the time of baseline assessment but tended 
to be slightly younger. The plotted line shows a one-to-one correspondence 
between biological age and chronological age. The larger number of plotted 
points below the line as compared to above the line indicates that CALERIE 
participants’ KDM Biological Ages tended to be slightly younger than their 
chronological ages.

 and homeostatic dysregulation) produced a consistent result: partici-
pants in the caloric-restriction arm of the trial experienced slowed 
biological aging as compared to participants in the ad libitum arm. 
Sensitivity analysis showed that slowed biological aging in the cal-
oric restriction arm of the trial was not accounted for by weight loss 
during the intervention phase.
The main contribution of this study is to provide initial evidence 
that methods to quantify biological aging are sensitive enough to 
detect effects of geroprotective therapy delivered to middle-aged 
adults in a small randomized trial. This evidence adds to findings 
from observational studies that accelerated biological aging meas-
ured using the same methods predicts functional decline, morbidity, 
and mortality in older adults (10,11,14,15,37,40). Together, this evi-
dence argues for using methods to quantify biological aging as out-
comes in trials of geroprotective therapies. For example, it is thought 
that pharmacotherapy may be able to replicate the geroprotective 
effects of caloric restriction (45). Methods for assessing biological 
aging used in this study provide benchmarks against which such 
pharmacotherapy might be evaluated.
Second, we illustrate here how methods originally designed 
for cross-sectional analysis of biological age can be implemented 
within a longitudinal design. To our knowledge, this is the first lon-
gitudinal analysis of KDM Biological Age and homeostatic dysreg-
ulation. The aging process involves changes occurring across time 
within individuals. To date, with some exceptions (46–50), most 
analysis of biological aging in humans continues to focus on cross-
sectional differences between younger and older persons. Several 
large databases allow for repeated measures analysis of indices of 
biological aging. An important next step in translating these indices 
for use in geroprotector trials is to develop better understanding of 
rates of change over time in the general population and relevant 
subgroups.
Finally, this study provides evidence that biological aging meas-
ures developed in mixed-age samples and tested for predicting out-
comes primarily in older adults are sensitive to changes produced by 
geroprotective intervention in the physiologies of relatively young 
individuals. Trajectories of aging begin to diverge as early as young 
adulthood (12), suggesting geroprotective therapies may be most 
effective when administered early, before age-related disease onsets 
(51). Younger persons may also be better able to sustain toxicity 
associated with some geroprotectors (52). Tried and tested metrics of 
biological aging like physical frailty (53) and accumulation of defi-
cits (54) are mostly invariant in young and midlife adults. Indices of 
biological aging may provide an alternative for geroprotector trials 
testing therapies in younger populations.
Limitations
Quantification of biological aging remains a work in progress. We 
applied two previously developed methods to quantify biological 
aging and obtained similar results. But there are many other proposed 
methods to quantify biological aging. For example, several proposed 
methods utilize genomic and other molecular data not yet available 
in the CALERIE Biobank (9,55–60). As new types of data are added 
to the CALERIE database, analysis of other biological aging meas-
ures will become possible. The methods we used were imperfect. For 
example, the Klemera–Doubal method is based on linear models

Note: The regression model included sex and age at baseline as covariates. KDM Biological Age increased in ad libitum-arm participants. Change in KDM Bio-
logical Age was not different from zero in caloric-restriction-arm participants. The difference between treatment arms in rate of change in KDM Biological Age was 
statistically significant (test of interaction p value = .003), indicating slowed biological aging in caloric-restriction-arm participants as compared to ad libitum-arm 
participants. CI = Confidence interval.

 relating biomarker levels to chronological age. But many biomarkers 
show nonlinear trajectories in aging, and biomarker relationships 
with mortality risk may also change with advancing age (61). As 
methods are refined, analyses can be repeated. CALERIE participants 
were almost exclusively white (95%). CALERIE participants were 
not blinded to intervention condition. Slowed biological aging in 
the caloric restriction-arm participants may partly reflect a placebo 
effect. Replication in other populations is needed. Both the Klemera–
Doubal Biological Age and homeostatic dysregulation methods have 
similar validity in white and non-White populations (15,37). But it 
is unknown if caloric restriction may have ethnicity-specific gero-
protective effects. Follow-up was right censored. The CALERIE trial 
was comparatively short (2 years). Whether changes to the rate of 
biological aging can be sustained over longer intervals is unknown. 
Also unknown is whether slowed biological aging observed in this 
study is sustained beyond the term of the intervention.
