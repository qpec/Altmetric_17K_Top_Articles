BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Dietary variety and diversity are recommended in dietary 
guidelines, but their association with BMI in US preschool-aged children is unknown. This 
study examined predictors of dietary variety and diversity and their association with child 
BMI z score (BMIz).
METHODS: Primary caregivers responded to a food frequency questionnaire. Child 
anthropometry was obtained concurrently (n = 340) and prospectively (n = 264). Dietary 
variety scores and dietary diversity scores were computed. Multivariable linear regression 
was used to model predictors of these scores and their association with BMIz concurrently 
and BMIz change per year prospectively.
RESULTS: The sample was 49.4% boys; 69.4% of the primary caregivers were non-Hispanic 
white and 46.2% had a high school education or less. Girls and older children had greater 
Fruit and Vegetable Variety (gender: P = .03, age: P < .001), Healthy Foods Variety (P = .02, 
P < .001), and Dietary Diversity (P = .04, P = .03) scores. Older children also had greater 
scores for Overall Variety (P < .001) and Moderation Foods (eg, high-fat, high-sugar foods 
recommended to be consumed in moderation) (P < .001). Having a non-Hispanic white 
primary caregiver (versus not) was associated with lower Dietary Diversity (P = .01). 
Greater Healthy Variety, Overall Variety, and Dietary Diversity were associated with greater 
annual increases in BMIz prospectively (β[SE] = 0.009 [0.004], P = .04; β[SE] = 0.007 [0.003], 
P = .02; β[SE] = 0.003 [0.001], P = .02, respectively), adjusted for energy intake.
CONCLUSIONS: Greater dietary variety and diversity were prospectively associated with higher 
BMIz. Targeting dietary variety and diversity as an obesity prevention strategy in children 
requires careful consideration.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Dietary variety 
and diversity from more healthful food categories 
are associated with a healthier weight status in US 
adults. Limited research examines this relationship 
in US children.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Dietary variety and 
diversity are either weakly associated or not 
associated with an increase in BMI z score in low-
income US preschool-aged children. Child age and 
gender are common predictors of measures of 
dietary variety and diversity.

FERNANDEZ et al 
Approximately 22.8% of preschoolers 
in the United States are overweight 
or obese,1 and the prevalence in 
low-income families is even greater, 
at 30.4%.2 Interventions are needed 
to prevent obesity in preschoolers, 
and dietary quality is a frequent 
focus for these interventions. Dietary 
quality is a broad term for several 
measures, including variety and 
diversity. Dietary variety measures 
the number of foods consumed 
from a predetermined list over a 
given time period. Dietary diversity 
captures not only the overall variety 
of foods consumed but also their 
relative distribution, and adherence 
to recommended dietary patterns 
for food groups. Dietary guidelines 
for Americans3–5 promote the 
consumption of a variety of fruits, 
vegetables, and proteins, and 
recommend the proportion of each 
food group to consume.3,4 However, 
the data supporting the link of either 
dietary variety or dietary diversity 
with weight status as a basis for 
informing obesity interventions are 
mixed.
A number of studies have examined 
the association of dietary variety 
and diversity6–12 with weight status 
in children, mostly outside of the 
United States, and their results 
have been conflicting, finding 
either no association6,8,9,12 or 
positive associations.9–11,13,14 The 
associations of dietary variety and 
dietary diversity with weight status 
have been studied more frequently 
in US adults15–17 than children. In 
adults, a greater variety of healthy 
foods is associated with a lower 
prevalence of overweight or obesity, 
whereas a greater variety of foods 
recommended to be consumed in 
moderation (eg, foods containing 
high levels of fats, added sugars, and 
sodium) is associated with a higher 
prevalence.15,18 We have been unable 
to identify any studies examining the 
association between dietary variety 
and dietary diversity with weight 
status in US preschoolers.19
The overall goal of this study was to 
examine the associations of dietary 
variety and dietary diversity with 
BMI z score (BMIz) in low-income 
US preschoolers. The first objective 
was to determine, within a low-
income population of preschoolers, 
the socio-demographic correlates of 
dietary variety and dietary diversity. 
The second objective was to test the 
hypotheses that dietary fruit and 
vegetable variety, healthy dietary 
variety, moderation foods variety, 
and dietary diversity are each 
associated with BMIz concurrently 
and with BMIz change per year 
prospectively.
METHODS
Participants
Participants (n = 380) were recruited 
from Head Start, a federally funded 
preschool program for low-income 
children, at sites in Southeast 
Michigan through an invitation to 
primary caregivers to participate 
in a study about children’s eating 
behavior.20 Exclusion criteria were 
parent with ≥4-year college degree; 
parent or child not English speaking; 
child in foster care, with food 
allergies, with significant medical 
problems or perinatal complications, 
or born at gestational age <35 weeks. 
Participants returned for follow-up 
measurements at an average of 20.6 
months (range 7.6–39.2 months). The 
study was approved by the University 
of Michigan Institutional Review 
Board. Written informed consent was 
provided by parents; families were 
compensated for their time.
Data Collection and Measures
Most (95%) participating primary 
caregivers were the child’s mother. 
Questionnaires were administered 
verbally by research staff. Primary 
caregivers reported children’s 
gender and age, as well as their own 
education (categorized as high school 
education or less versus more than 
high school education) and race/
ethnicity (categorized for this report 
as non-Hispanic white versus not). 
Primary caregivers completed the US 
Department of Agriculture 18-item 
Household Food Security Survey 
that categorizes households as food 
secure or insecure.21
Children and their primary caregiver 
were weighed and measured 
without shoes or heavy clothing by

trained staff according to standard 
protocols on a ±0.1 kg calibrated 
scale (Detecto Physician’s Scale 
Model DR550; Webb City, MO) and 
a ±0.1 cm calibrated stadiometer 
(Seca 217/213; Birmingham, United 
Kingdom). Child BMI z scores were 
calculated based on the US Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention 
growth references.22
Data on children’s dietary 
intake were obtained via the 
Harvard Service Food Frequency 
Questionnaire (HSFFQ) at baseline.23 
For this study, the times the mother 
reported the child consumed 
foods over the past 4 weeks were 
converted to serving sizes, based 
on updated information from two 
24-hour recalls of foods listed on the 
HSFFQ in low-income 2- to 3- and 
4- to 5-year-olds (Laura Sampson, 
RD, e-mail communication, October 
19, 2012). Mixed dishes were broken 
down into their constituent foods, 
based on the standard ingredient 
assumptions made in the HSFFQ 
(Laura Sampson, RD, e-mail 
communication, June 10, 2014).
Each food was assigned into ≥1 of the 
following categories: grain, protein, 
vegetable, fruit, dairy, combined fruit 
and vegetable, healthy foods, and 
moderation foods based on the 2010 
Dietary Guidelines for Americans.3 
Healthy foods included those for 
which increases in consumption are 
recommended (eg, fruits, vegetables, 
grains, dairy, lean protein). These are 
foods that, when consumed as part of 
a balanced diet, are associated with 
health benefits or with achieving 
a healthy nutritional status.3 
Moderation foods included those 
for which decreases in consumption 
are recommended (eg, sweets, salty 
snacks, high-fat meats, fried foods) to 
manage body weight and to decrease 
the risk of certain chronic diseases.3

consumed within the following 
groups: Fruits and Vegetables, 
Healthy Foods, and Moderation 
Foods. Scores were assigned based 
on the number of foods within each 
group of which a child consumed 
≥1 serving per week. One point 
was awarded to the Variety score 
for each food that met the criterion 
of ≥1 serving per week. The range 
of potential scores for Fruit and 
Vegetable Variety was 0 to 30, for 
Healthy Variety was 0 to 49, and 
Moderation Foods Variety was 0 to 
31, and Overall Variety was 0 to 80.
The Dietary Diversity score was 
created to account for (1) the variety 
of foods served within each food 
group (more points awarded for 
more variety); (2) the distribution 
of consumption of different 
foods (more points awarded for 
more even distribution of foods 
consumed within a group); and 
(3) the distribution of food groups 
in the diet, in comparison with 
the recommended distribution 
based on the Dietary Guidelines 
for Americans.3 First, the Berry 
Index (BI) score24 for vegetables, 
grains, protein, dairy, and fruit was 
calculated. The BI score represents 
the proportion of different types 
of foods consumed within each of 
these food groups, and is calculated 
as BI = 1 –  
 
∑ 
 
 
 
 
  
s

, where  
 
s

is equal to 
the number of servings consumed 
within the food group divided by the 
number of all foods on the HSFFQ 
within that group.24 To standardize 
the BI scores across different food 
groups, a BI percentile was created 
comparing the child’s BI for each 
food group with the distribution of BI 
scores in the analytic sample for that 
food group.
Next, the total percent 
concordance of a child’s diet with 
the recommended food group 
proportions according to the 
Dietary Guidelines for Americans3 
was calculated. The percentage 
of servings from the 5 major food 
groups (vegetables, grains, protein, 
dairy, and fruit) for each age group 
was compared with the age-specific 
recommended proportion of servings 
to obtain a percentage concordance 
with dietary guidelines for each food 
group for that child, from 0% to 
100%. This value was multiplied by 
the BI percentile and then all of the 
food groups were summed to attain 
the Dietary Diversity score. The 
range of potential scores for Dietary 
Diversity was 0 to 100 with higher 
scores reflecting a more diverse diet.
Statistical Analysis
The analytic sample was limited 
to children with complete data for 
baseline BMIz, dietary data, and 
sociodemographic information (n 
= 340). The sample with complete 
data (n = 340) did not differ from 
the sample without complete 
data (n = 40) with regard to child 
gender, child age, and child BMIz. 
The analytic sample did differ with 
regard to the primary caregiver’s 
level of education (P = .02), such 
that primary caregivers of those 
included in the study had a higher 
level of education. The participants 
with follow-up measurements (n = 
264) did not differ from those with 
baseline data but without follow-up 
measurements (n = 76) with regard 
to child gender, child age, primary 
caregiver’s education level, or child 
BMIz at baseline.
Univariate statistics were used 
to describe the sample. Bivariate 
associations between the 
sociodemographic characteristics 
and the dietary variety and Dietary 
Diversity scores were estimated. 
Multivariable linear regression 
models were used to test the 
association of sociodemographic 
characteristics with the dietary 
variety and Dietary Diversity 
scores, adjusting for estimated 
energy intake. Linear regression 
models were used to assess the 
association of the dietary variety 
and Dietary Diversity scores with 
the children’s BMIz concurrently

(n = 340) and rate of change per 
year in BMIz from baseline to the 
follow-up time (n = 264), controlling 
for child gender, age, energy intake; 
primary caregiver education, race/
ethnicity, and BMI; and household 
food security. The models evaluating 
change in BMIz as outcomes also 
controlled for the child’s baseline 
BMIz. We also computed models to 
examine whether the association of 
dietary variety and dietary diversity 
scores with prospective change in 
child BMIz differed by the child’s 
baseline weight status, adjusting for 
covariates.
RESULTS
Characteristics of the sample at 
baseline (n = 340) are shown in 
Table 1. The unadjusted bivariate 
associations are shown in Table 2. 
Non-Hispanic whites had a lower mean 
Dietary Diversity score (mean [SD] = 
45.0 [15.3]) than other race/ethnicities 
(mean [SD] = 50.2 [16.3]) (P = .005). 
Those in food insecure households 
had a higher mean Moderation Foods 
Variety score (mean [SD] = 15.4 [4.5]) 
than those in food secure households 
(mean [SD] = 13.7 [4.9]) (P = .01). 
None of the mean scores for any of the 
measures differed by child gender or 
primary caregiver education. Age was 
positively correlated with each of the 
measures of dietary variety, but not 
with the Dietary Diversity score (P = 
.07). Primary caregiver BMI was not 
significantly correlated with any of the 
5 scores.
The associations of sociodemographic 
characteristics in multivariable 
models with each dietary variety 
score and the Dietary Diversity 
score, adjusted for energy intake, are 
shown in Table 3. Girls had higher 
Fruit and Vegetable Variety (β[SE] = 
0.91 [0.41]; P = .03), Healthy Foods 
Variety (β[SE] = 1.29 [0.56]; P = .02), 
and Dietary Diversity (β[SE] = 3.30 
[1.62]; P = .04) scores than boys. 
Older child age was associated with 
higher scores in all measures of 
dietary variety and Dietary Diversity. 
The child’s primary caregiver being 
non-Hispanic white was associated 
with a lower Dietary Diversity score 
than if the primary caregiver was any 
other race/ethnicity (β[SE] = –4.57 
[1.77]; P = .01). Primary caregiver 
education, primary caregiver BMI, 
and household food security were not 
associated with any of the scores.
The associations of the dietary 
variety scores and the Dietary 
Diversity score with BMIz are shown 
in Table 4. There were no significant 
associations between any of the 5 
scores and concurrent BMIz. Greater 
Healthy Variety, Overall Variety, 
and Dietary Diversity each were 
associated with greater annual 
increases in BMIz from baseline to 
follow-up, but the effect sizes were 
small. There was suggestive evidence 
of an association of greater Fruit 
and Vegetable Variety with a greater 
annual increase in BMIz (P = .06) 
though the effect size also was small.
The association of the dietary variety 
scores and the Dietary Diversity 
score with the rate of change in 
BMIz per year, stratified by child 
baseline weight status is shown in 
Table 5. Among children who were 
obese at baseline, greater Healthy 
Foods Variety was associated with 
greater annual increases in BMIz. 
In this same subset of children, 
there was suggestive evidence of a 
positive association between greater 
Fruit and Vegetable Variety, Overall 
Variety, and Dietary Diversity and 
annual increases in BMIz (P = .08, 
P = .06, and P = .05, respectively). 
For children with a baseline BMI 
under the 50th percentile, there was 
suggestive evidence of an association 
between Overall Variety and greater 
annual increases in BMIz (P = .08).
DISCUSSION
This study had several key findings. 
First, girls had higher measures 
of healthier dietary quality. Older 
children had more variety in all 
measures and also had greater 
diversity. Children of Hispanic or 
nonwhite primary caregivers had 
more diverse diets. The primary 
caregiver’s level of education, 
primary caregiver’s BMI, and the 
household’s food security status 
were not associated with the child’s 
dietary variety or diversity. The 
second key finding was that there 
was no detectable association of 
dietary variety or diversity with 
the child’s BMIz concurrently. 
Furthermore, greater dietary variety 
and diversity were associated with 
significantly greater prospective 
annual increases in the child’s BMIz 
over a follow-up period averaging 
20.6 months in models adjusting 
for energy intake and potential 
confounders. Although these effect 
sizes were small, they are notable in

that the direction of effect was the 
opposite of that which is generally 
motivating efforts to improve the 
quality of children’s diets. The 
effects on greater prospective annual 
change in BMIz were most notable 
for Healthy Variety, Overall Variety, 
and Dietary Diversity. We sought to 
determine whether these positive 
associations could be explained by 
healthy weight gain in lower-weight 
children. Stratified analyses indicate 
that this is the not the case, because 
statistically significant and suggestive 
associations primarily were observed 
in children who were obese at 
baseline.
Our finding that girls consume diets 
higher in healthy dietary variety 
and diversity measures (indicators 
of high dietary quality) but not 
in Moderation Foods Variety (an 
indicator of lower dietary quality) 
is consistent with previous studies 
that have found that girls tend 
to have higher-quality diets than 
boys.25–28 Also, several studies 
have demonstrated that girls tend 
to consume greater quantities of 
fruits and vegetables and that they 
consume them more frequently.26 
Our finding that older children 
consumed diets higher in variety and 
diversity is consistent with previous 
work documenting that children 
accept a wider variety of foods as 
they grow older.29 Our finding that 
having a parent who is Hispanic 
or nonwhite is associated with the 
child consuming a diet with greater 
diversity, and that race/ethnicity was 
not associated with variety measures, 
contributes to a mixed literature with 
regard to the association between 
diet quality and race/ethnicity.28,30–33
The emphasis on variety and 
diversity in dietary guidelines may 
not be compatible with efforts 
to decrease the risk of obesity in 
low-income children. Our results 
showed either no association or 
a positive association between 
variety and diversity with BMIz. 
Our cross-sectional results, which 
indicated no association between 
any of the variety or diversity 
measures with BMIz, were consistent 
with several other cross-sectional 
studies6,8,9 in children of similar 
age ranges but they were also 
inconsistent with some that show 
significant positive associations.7,9–11 
However, the vast majority of 
these cross-sectional studies 
were conducted in developing 
countries.7–11 In a cross-sectional 
study6 conducted in a population 
more likely to be similar to US 
children (Spain), the results were 
consistent with those in the current 
study: there was no significant 
association between obese or 
overweight with dietary variety. The 
results of our prospective analyses, 
which showed a positive association 
between most measures of dietary 
variety and diversity with annual 
change in BMIz, are consistent with 
the other prospective studies12–14 
in US children who we were able to 
identify. In contrast, other measures 
of overall dietary quality have 
been shown in some studies to be 
negatively associated with BMI in 
children.34,35 It is important to note 
that, although we saw some positive 
associations between variety and 
diversity with BMIz, the effect sizes 
were small and are not indicative 
of an increased risk of attaining 
an unhealthy BMIz. Furthermore, 
previous literature shows that 
greater dietary variety and diversity 
are associated with a decreased risk 
for nutritional inadequacy.36–39
The inconsistent findings in the 
literature of dietary variety or 
diversity may be due, in part, to 
different serving cutoff points to 
determine if the consumption of a 
particular food will count toward 
the variety or diversity score. For 
example, in the study by Mirmiran et 
al,10 at least half a serving of a food 
must be consumed for it to count 
toward the diversity score; in the 
Diet Diversity 10-g score created by

Kennedy et al,9 at least 10 g of a food 
needs to be consumed for it to count 
toward the variety score (except 
fats and oils); and in the study by 
Chua et al,11 a point was awarded 
toward the variety score for any food 
item consumed daily or in the past 
7 days. Additionally, other aspects 
in the measurement of variety and 
diversity differ. In some studies (as in 
the current study), a simple count of 
foods consumed within food groups 
is used as a measure of variety.6,7,11 
In other studies, additional steps 
are taken when creating a measure, 
such as truncating scores so that 
the consumption of more than the 
recommended serving of a single 
food or food group does not inflate 
the variety score.8,13
Strengths of this study include the 
longitudinal sample with a high 
prevalence of overweight and obesity. 
This population is unique in that no 
previous studies of dietary variety 
7
and diversity have the combined 
characteristics of this sample: a 
US population that is low-income, 
of mixed race/ethnicity, and of 
preschool age. We constructed indices 
of dietary variety that differentiate 
between foods for which an increase 
in consumption is recommended 
and foods for which a decrease 
in consumption is recommended. 
Furthermore, we created a novel 
measure of dietary diversity that 
accounted not only for the variety of 
intake but also for proportions and 
adherence with the 2010 Dietary 
Guidelines for Americans. Another 
strength is that we adjusted for 
energy intake and for several other 
confounders. There are limitations 
that should be noted. The dietary 
data were obtained by food frequency 
questionnaire, which relies on 
estimated portions and preparation 
methods and does not differentiate 
between different types or brands of 
food items. Also, the results may not 
be generalizable to populations unlike 
this cohort (low-income Midwestern 
preschool-aged children).
CONCLUSIONS
The current study, as well as previous 
literature, finds that dietary variety 
and diversity are either not associated, 
or are weakly associated with an 
increase (not decrease) in BMIz. 
Despite the importance of dietary 
quality for a healthy nutritional profile 
and for healthy growth, increasing the 
variety of healthy foods in children’s 
diets for the purpose of obesity 
control or prevention requires 
careful consideration.
