Abstract
A major challenge in disease ecology is to understand how co-infecting parasite species interact.
We manipulate in vivo resources and immunity to explain interactions between two rodent malaria
parasites, Plasmodium chabaudi and P. yoelii. These species have analogous resource-use strategies
to the human parasites Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax: P. chabaudi and P. falciparum infect
red blood cells (RBC) of all ages (RBC generalist); P. yoelii and P. vivax preferentially infect
young RBCs (RBC specialist). We find that: (1) recent infection with the RBC generalist facilitates
the RBC specialist (P. yoelii density is enhanced ~10 fold). This occurs because the RBC generalist
increases availability of the RBC specialist’s preferred resource; (2) co-infections with the RBC
generalist and RBC specialist are highly virulent; (3) and the presence of an RBC generalist in a
host population can increase the prevalence of an RBC specialist. Thus, we show that resources
shape how parasite species interact and have epidemiological consequences.

INTRODUCTION
Mixed-species
infections
are
common
and
interactions
between co-infecting species can either promote or inhibit
other parasite species in the same host (Graham 2008; Grif-
fiths et al. 2014). These interactions affect disease severity,
parasite fitness and the prevalence and distribution of parasite
species in a host population (Ferrari et al. 2009; Knowles
et al. 2013; Pedersen & Antonovics 2013; Viney & Graham
2013). However, the within-host mechanisms that underpin
between-species interactions and drive their epidemiological
consequences are poorly understood. Co-infecting parasite
species can interact with one another directly or, more com-
monly, through changing the within-host environment (Mideo
2009). For example, the nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis
alters resources available for Plasmodium chabaudi (rodent
malaria) during co-infection of mice (Griffiths et al. 2015).
Interactions also occur via the host immune response if one
species interferes with, or enhances, attack on a co-infecting
species (Wolday et al. 1999; Reese et al. 2014). Determining
how interactions between co-infecting parasite species shape
infection dynamics, virulence and transmission are major
questions in disease ecology.
Malaria infections in humans, rodents and birds commonly
contain multiple co-infecting parasite species (Killick-Ken-
drick & Peters 1978; Valkiunas et al. 2006; Juliano et al.
2010). For example, between 5 and 65% of human malaria
infections contain both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmod-
ium vivax parasites (Looareesuwan et al. 1987; Mayxay et al.
2004; Douglas et al. 2011; Ginouves et al. 2015). Interactions
between conspecific genotypes result in competitive suppres-
sion in the rodent malaria P. chabaudi, and this has significant
implications for the evolution of both virulence and drug
resistance (Bell et al. 2006; Pollitt et al. 2011, 2014; Read
et al. 2011). Correlational data suggest that competitive sup-
pression also occurs between conspecific genotypes of P. falci-
parum
(Daubersies
et al.
1996;
Mercereau-Puijalon
1996;
Smith et al. 1999; F€
arnert 2008). However, whereas competi-
tion has been demonstrated between conspecifics, whether this
also occurs between heterospecifics within mixed-species infec-
tions is poorly understood (but see (Bruce et al. 2000)).
Dynamics of malaria infections are shaped through complex
combinations
of
top-down
(immunity)
and
bottom-up
(resources) processes (Haydon et al. 2003; Mideo et al. 2008;
Metcalf et al. 2011). Some species of malaria parasites prefer-
entially infect particular age classes of red blood cells (RBC),
so different species may occupy slightly separate resource
niches in the host. As well as reducing resource competition,
it has been suggested that this niche differentiation could lead
to facilitation. Mcqueen & Mckenzie (2006) modelled parasite
and RBC dynamics in co-infections of the two most common
human malaria parasite species and predicted that P. falci-
parum facilitates replication of P. vivax. This occurs because

 induces anaemia which causes the host to produce new RBCs
and shifts the age structure of host RBCs towards younger
cells, which are the preferred resource of P. vivax (an RBC
specialist; Mcqueen & Mckenzie 2006). If an RBC-specialist
species benefits from the presence of an RBC generalist, the
consequences of infection by the specialist, for individual
hosts and at the population level, will depend on the presence
of the generalist. Thus, in areas where P. falciparum preva-
lence is declining (e.g. through control programmes) this may
cause unintended changes to P. vivax prevalence.
Here, we test the predictions of Mcqueen & Mckenzie
(2006) by experimentally perturbing resource availability and
the immune environment (apparent competition) of mixed-
species malaria infections. Specifically, we test whether one
species of rodent malaria parasite (P. chabaudi) can alter RBC
resource availability sufficiently to facilitate the replication of
another species (P. yoelii). P. chabaudi is an RBC generalist
because it infects RBCs of all ages, whereas P. yoelii is a RBC
specialist that preferentially infects young RBCs. These species
are ideal model systems for investigating the within-host
mechanisms mediating interactions between parasites because
the ecology of individual species is well understood, the per-
formance of each species can be tracked and RBC resources
and immunity can be separately perturbed. We show that the
RBC-specialist parasite (P. yoelii) reaches higher densities in
hosts that have an existing infection with the RBC generalist
(P. chabaudi). This facilitation occurs due to an increase in
the supply of the specialist’s preferred age of RBC, with
heterologous immunity (raised against the heterospecific P.
chabaudi) having little impact on P. yoelii densities. Further-
more, we show that mixed-species infections increase the risk
of host mortality. Motivated by our findings, we develop a
heuristic model of the fitness of an RBC-specialist parasite in
different within-host environments to determine the conditions
under which fitness will be higher if an RBC generalist is also
circulating in the host population. We find that the facilitation
we observe only benefits P. yoelii when the prevalence of P.
chabaudi, at the host population level, is below a particular
threshold. Overall, our results reveal how multiple parasite
species, with differing resource preferences, interact through
bottom-up changes to the within-host environment, impacting
upon parasite replication, host health and epidemiology.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Parasites
We used the parasite genotypes: P. chabaudi chabaudi AS
(AS12476) and P. yoelii yoelii 17X Mill Hill (35GA), from the
European Malaria Reagent Repository, University of Edin-
burgh. Both species were isolated from thicket rats in Central
African Republic during the 1960s and were often (12/22
cases) found to co-infect the same host. Whereas P. chabaudi
chabaudi can infect RBCs of all age classes (RBC generalist),
P. yoelii yoelii shows strong preference for the youngest RBCs
(reticulocytes; RBC specialist). Both parasite species have
been widely used to address questions ranging from the
molecular mechanisms of RBC invasion to the competitive
dynamics between conspecific strains.
Infections
Hosts were 8–10-weeks-old male MF1 mice (Harlan-Olac,
Bicester, UK), maintained on ad libitum food (RM3(P), DBM
Scotland Ltd, Grangemouth, UK) and water (supplemented
with 0.05% PABA to enhance parasite growth), with a
12 : 12 h light:dark cycle, at 21 °C. Mice were randomly allo-
cated to cages containing 2–4 animals and randomly assigned
to treatment groups. Infections were initiated by intraperi-
toneal (IP) injection of 105 parasitised RBCs in 100 lL carrier
(following Bell et al. 2006) and mixed-species infections with
2 9 105 infected RBCs in 200 lL carrier, consisting of 105
infected RBCs of each parasite species (note that increasing
the initial dose by a factor of > 10 is required to significantly
affect parasite dynamics and virulence; Timms et al. 2001).
Our design keeps the dose of the focal species (P. yoelii) con-
stant while altering the within-host environment, a standard
practice when studying Plasmodium co-infections (R�
aberg
et al. 2006; Reece et al. 2008; Pollitt et al. 2011). We chose
P. yoelii as the focal species because our work is motivated by
Mcqueen & Mckenzie (2006), in which the human parasite
P.falciparum (RBC generalist) is predicted to facilitate P.
vivax (RBC specialist). Protocols passed ethical review and
are approved by the UK Home Office (Project License 60/
4121). All procedures were carried out in accordance with the
UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.
Experimental design
We designed our experiments to test the impact of prior or con-
current infection with an RBC-generalist species on the replica-
tion of an RBC specialist and determine the contributions of
the immune and resource environments to the RBC-specialist’s
performance. Mice were allocated to one of the five following
treatment groups: (1) Single infection (control) mice received
only P. yoelii; (2) Mixed infection (MI) mice simultaneously
received P. yoelii and P. chabaudi; (3) Parasite-Induced Anae-
mia (PIA) mice were infected with P. chabaudi 10 days before
they received P. yoelii; (4) Heterologous Immune Challenge
(HIC) mice were infected with P. chabaudi, cured after 8 days
by IP injection of 12 mg kg�1 pyrimethamine (in 50 lL DMSO;
Sigma, Dorcet UK) for two consecutive days, and then given
pyrimethamine-treated water (7 mg mL�1) for 2 more days.
After 14 days, when RBC age structure and density had
returned to pre-infection levels, antibodies against P. chabaudi
had developed and all P. chabaudi parasites were cleared (con-
firmed by qPCR), these mice were infected with P. yoelii; (5)
Artificial Anaemia (AA) mice were IP injected with 60 mg/kg�1
phenylhydrazine (PHZ; dissolved in PBS; Sigma, UK) 3 days
before infection with P. yoelii. PHZ induces a large increase in
reticulocytes (P. yoelii’s preferred resource) within days (Savill
et al. 2009). All infections with P. yoelii were initiated at the
same time from the same parasite inoculum and 5–7 mice were
infected for each treatment. To control for any possible effects
of pyrimethamine in the HIC treatment group, mice in all
groups were treated with pyrimethamine, in the same manner,
prior to P. yoelii infection. To control for P. chabaudi or PHZ
injections, we injected mice in the groups not receiving these
treatments with the carrier solution plus uninfected RBCs or

 PBS, respectively. All treatment groups, sample sizes and the
experimental timeline are displayed in Fig. 1.
Sampling
We used species-specific qPCR to separately count the number
of P. yoelii and P. chabaudi genomes per lL of blood. P. yoelii
cumulative density was calculated from samples taken from
each mouse on alternate days between day 0 and day 8 post-
infection. This period was chosen because we are interested in
how the starting conditions of the within-host environment
impact the replication of our focal (RBC specialist) parasite spe-
cies (Fig. S5 for P. yoelii temporal dynamics). Because P. yoelii
replication is non-synchronous, PCR counts could overestimate
the number of infected RBCs if schizonts (parasites in the final
stage of their cell cycle, after DNA replication has occurred) are
present or if RBCs are parasitised by multiple parasites. To
check for this, we also calculated the density of P. yoelii-infected
RBCs from slides for single-species infections (treatments: con-
trol, HIC and AA). Overall, P. yoelii densities were slightly
lower when calculated from slides, but the relative difference
between treatment groups was consistent with counts by PCR
(Treatment 9 measurement
method;
F2,32 = 0.8,
P = 0.46;
Table S2). Thus, for analyses of single-species infections we
include P. yoelii densities estimated through both PCR and
microscopy (while controlling for method). On each sampling
day, mice were weighed, blood samples were taken from the tail
for qPCR of parasite density (5 lL) and to quantify RBCs by
flow cytometry (2 lL; Beckman Coulter), and thin blood
smears were taken to determine the proportion of RBCs that
were reticulocytes. To estimate heterologous and homologous
immunity on the day of P. yoelii infection, we assayed IgG2a
antibodies (10 lL of blood), which are known to induce strong
protection against malaria in mice (Cavinato et al. 2001). We
measured homologous immunity against a particular region of
MSP1 which is specific for P. chabaudi AS (O’Donnell et al.
2001; Burns et al. 2004; Fairlie-Clarke et al. 2010) and heterolo-
gous immunity against crude antigen homogenate from P. yoe-
lii-parasitised RBCs. This verified that prior infection with P.
chabaudi generated an acquired response and gave a measure of

 antibodies that could also act against P. yoelii (i.e. species-trans-
cending antibodies generated by P. chabaudi). Further details
for the qPCR and immunological assays are given in SI.
Data analyses
All analyses were performed using R v3.0.2 (R core team
(2013) The R foundation for statistical computing; http://
www.R-project.org). General linear models, combined with
post-hoc Tukey contrasts (package multcomp), were used to
test for treatment effects on the following response variables:
cumulative P. yoelii density (log10 transformed), day 0 RBC
density (log10 transformed), day 0 reticulocyte density (log10
transformed), proportion reticulocytes (logit transformed) and
antibody titres (log10 transformed). To determine the relative
contributions of within-host variables to cumulative P. yoelii
density (log10 transformed), we used a general linear model
with all the explanatory variables described above. We used a
generalised linear model (with binomial error structure) to test
for the effects of treatment, minimum RBC density (log10
transformed), mean proportion of reticulocytes and minimum
weight on host mortality. We followed model simplification,
sequentially dropping the least significant term until the mini-
mum adequate model was reached. Full details of all statisti-
cal models are provided in Tables S1–6.
Modelling
To predict how the prevalence of P. chabaudi infections in a
host population affects P. yoelii fitness, we developed a simple
mathematical model. We divide the host population into three
classes, corresponding to three of our experimental treatment
groups: na€
ıve hosts who have never been infected by P. cha-
baudi (e.g. control; C), hosts who are currently infected by P.
chabaudi and whose within-host environment has yet to be
altered (e.g. MI) and hosts who are recovering from a P. cha-
baudi infection and have an altered within-host environment
(e.g. PIA). Assuming P. yoelii is equally likely to be transmit-
ted to each host type, then the average fitness of the parasite
will be the sum of the fitness achieved in each host type, wi,
weighted by the frequency of that host type, pi. In other words,
�
w ¼ pCwC þ pMIwMI þ pPIAwPIA
ð1Þ
where the overbar denotes an average. We use / to denote
the proportion of the population that has ever been exposed
to P. chabaudi (akin to ‘seroprevalence’; hosts in MI and PIA
classes), and w to denote the prevalence of active P. chabaudi
infections (MI only, which assumes that P. chabaudi densities
are negligible in PIA hosts; note that we could recast the
model with prevalence including PIA and MI hosts with no
qualitative change in inferences). The frequencies of the host
types are therefore,
pC ¼ ð1 � /Þ;
pMI ¼ w;
pPIA ¼ / � w:
We define the host type-specific fitnesses (wi) according to
the costs and benefits we observe in our experimental work
and use this model to determine the conditions under which
an RBC specialist (P. yoelii) is predicted to benefit from the
presence of an RBC generalist (P. chabaudi) circulating in the
host population.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We use data from different treatment groups to address two
questions. First, does prior infection with an RBC generalist
facilitate growth of an RBC specialist and does timing matter
(Fig. 1a)? Second, how do changes in the immune environ-
ment and RBC resource availability independently affect repli-
cation of the RBC specialist (Fig. 1b)?
Infection with an RBC generalist facilitates an RBC specialist
When P. yoelii parasites were inoculated into a within-host
environment that had already been altered by P. chabaudi
infection, they reached significantly higher densities than in
either control infections or simultaneous mixed infections
(PIA vs. control; z = 2.9, P = 0.01; PIA vs. MI; z = 2.98,
P = 0.01; Fig. 2a; Table S2). P. yoelii parasites in simultane-
ous mixed infections had similar density to those in control
infections (control vs. MI; z = 0.03, P = 0.9994; Fig. 2a;
Table S2). Therefore, a recent infection with an RBC general-
ist (P. chabaudi) facilitates a reticulocyte specialist (P. yoelii).
However, timing matters because significant facilitation only
occurred when the RBC generalist was already established in
the host.
The difference in performance of P. yoelii across treatments
can be explained by the within-host environment at infection.
Pre-infection with P. chabaudi (but not simultaneous infec-
tion) significantly reduced the total RBC density of hosts
(PIA vs. control; z = 22.8, P < 0.0001; Table S1; Fig. 2b), but
significantly increased the density and proportion of reticulo-
cytes
(PIA
vs.
control
for
reticulocyte
density:
z = 3.7,
P = 0.002; and proportion of reticulocytes: z = 7.6, P < 0.001;
Table S1; Fig. 2c) compared to control mice, on the day of
infection with P. yoelii. Pre-infection with P. chabaudi also led
to an increase in the concentration of antibodies to P. cha-
baudi (PIA vs. control; z = 3.1, P = 0.02; Table S1; Fig. 2d),
but
antibodies
to
P.
yoelii
were
unchanged
(treatment,
F = 2.15, P = 0.09; Table S1; Fig. 2d). In contrast, on the
day of infection, mice simultaneously receiving P. yoelii and
P. chabaudi (MI treatment group) did not differ significantly
from control mice in either resources or immunity (RBC den-
sity:
z = 0.51,
P = 0.99;
reticulocyte
density:
z = 0.21,
P = 0.99; proportion of reticulocytes: z = 0.12, P = 0.99; P.
yoelii antibodies: treatment, F = 2.15, P = 0.09; P. chabaudi
antibodies: z = 0.44, P = 0.99; Table S1; Fig. 2). These results
suggest that the facilitation observed in the PIA group is
mediated by host anaemia resulting in increased production of
reticulocytes (Mcqueen & Mckenzie 2006).
Resource availability is a key determinant of the RBC-specialist’s
performance
The most notable change to the within-host environment in
the infections where P. yoelii was facilitated is the substantial

 increase in the density and proportion of RBCs that are retic-
ulocytes (Figs 2 and S3). However, it is also possible that pre-
infection with P. chabaudi benefits P. yoelii parasites by alter-
ing the host’s immune environment in a manner not reflected
in the antibody assays, or that the few remaining P. chabaudi
parasites (Fig. S1) interacted directly with P. yoelii parasites.
The artificial anaemia and heterologous immunity treatment
groups allow us to partition the relative contributions of RBC
resources and heterologous immunity to the facilitation of P.
yoelii (below and Fig. 1b).
In the artificial anaemia treatment group, mice were treated
with PHZ prior to P. yoelii infection. PHZ causes anaemia,
resulting
in
lower
total
RBC
density
(control
vs.
AA;
z = 14.2, P < 0.001; Table S1; Fig. 3b), and stimulates the
production
of
reticulocytes
(proportion

reticulocytes:

P < 0.001;
reticulocyte
density:
control
vs.
AA;
z = 4.6, P < 0.001; Table S1; Figs 3c and S3). In comparison
to the parasite-induced anaemia group, the overall reduction
in RBC density in the artificial anaemia group was lower
(PIA vs. AA; z = 12.3, P < 0.001), and there was a borderline
increase in the proportion of reticulocytes (mean reticulocyte
proportion: PIA = 0.16 (�0.06), AA = 0.06 (�0.004); z = 2.5,
P = 0.08), but the resulting reticulocyte density was nearly
identical (mean log10 reticulocyte density: PIA = 8.51 (�0.16),
AA = 8.48 (�0.02); z = 0.3, P = 0.99). As intended, PHZ
treatment did not alter the concentration of antibodies to
P. yoelii or P. chabaudi compared to control mice (P. yoelii
antibodies:
treatment,
F = 2.15,
P = 0.09;
P.
chabaudi
antibodies: AA vs. control, z = 2.3, P = 0.14; Fig. 3d). As
predicted under the hypothesis that elevating reticulocytes
facilitates an RBC specialist, P. yoelii density was nearly two
times higher in the artificial anaemia treatment than in control
mice (z = 2.6, P = 0.025).
In the heterologous immunity treatment group, mice were
given an infection with P. chabaudi 26 days prior to inocula-
tion with P. yoelii. P. chabaudi parasites were allowed to
establish for 8 days before receiving drug treatment to clear
all parasites. The density and age structure of RBCs had
returned to normal by the time of P. yoelii infection (control
vs. HIC on day 0: RBC density, z = 2.03, P = 0.25; propor-
tion of reticulocytes: z = 0.25, P = 0.99; reticulocyte density,
z = 0.59, P = 0.98). As intended, pre-infection with P. cha-
baudi resulted in significantly higher anti-P. chabaudi antibod-
ies than in control mice (z = 3.9, P < 0.001), as measured
through the IgG2a antibodies targeting P. chabaudi MSP1. In
contrast, antibodies against P. yoelii crude antigen remained
unchanged (treatment, F = 2.15, P = 0.09), suggesting that P.
chabaudi infection did not generate a species-transcending
IgG2a response. As predicted, P. yoelii density in HIC mice
was
not
significantly
different
from
controls
(z = 1.4,
P = 0.34).
The results above strongly support the role of resource
availability in facilitating P. yoelii and suggest that heterolo-
gous immunity plays a minor (if any) role. Although the retic-
ulocyte density on the day of infection was nearly identical
under the parasite-induced anaemia and artificial anaemia
treatments,
the
relative
increase
in
parasite
density
was
slightly higher in parasite-induced anaemia mice. This could
be due to the proportion of RBCs that were reticulocytes
being higher, or to other differences in the within-host

 environment (e.g. immunity). To further investigate whether
any of these variables could cause the increase in P. yoelii
density in anaemic mice, we analysed data from PCR counts
(to ensure only P. yoelii was counted) for all treatments. We
fitted a model with the following explanatory variables mea-
sured on day 0: reticulocyte density, proportion of RBC that
were reticulocytes and levels of antibodies to P. chabaudi and
P. yoelii. The proportion of reticulocytes was the only vari-
able that showed a significant positive correlation with P. yoe-
lii density (F1,29 = 6.4, P = 0.017; Fig. S2; Table S3), further
suggesting that resources, not immunity, are the drivers of
facilitation. Because reticulocyte density failed to explain sig-
nificant variation in P. yoelii density (F1,26 = 0.05, P = 0.82),
the relative abundance of reticulocytes rather than their abso-
lute density may determine P. yoelii replication rate. All
malaria parasites have limited time to find a suitable RBC to
invade and the encounter rate with their preferred resource is
likely to be crucial for infection success (Cowman & Crabb
2006).
Co-infections of an RBC generalist and RBC specialist have a high
virulence
Hosts with a single infection of either our RBC-generalist or
our RBC-specialist species usually control their infection
through immunity and replacement of lost RBC (Spence et al.
2013; Pollitt et al. 2015). However, in the facilitated infec-
tions, the production of RBC fuelled the RBC specialist and
heterologous immunity had no impact. We tested whether
these processes resulted in mixed-species infections being more
virulent than single-species infections. We compared mortality,
weight loss and anaemia for the mice used in the previous
analyses plus an additional 5–7 mice per treatment (see Fig. 1)
for 26 days after infection with P. yoelii. Weight loss and
anaemia are standard measures of virulence in this system (De
Roode et al. 2005; Bell et al. 2006; Pollitt et al. 2013, 2014,
2015).
Mortality differed dramatically among treatment groups
(survival to day 26 ~ treatment: v2
4,63 = 23.11, P < 0.0001;
Fig. 4a) with high mortality in the parasite-induced anaemia
and mixed infection treatments (71 and 80%, respectively),
but few or no deaths in other treatment groups (con-
trol = 0%, HIC = 0%, AA 8%). Note that we did not investi-
gate single infections with P. chabaudi because multiple
experiments demonstrate that this species (and the particular
strain we used) rarely leads to mouse mortality (Seixas &
Ostler 2005; Bell et al. 2006; Mideo et al. 2008; Reece et al.
2008; Pollitt et al. 2011). Therefore, infection with two para-
site species, either simultaneously or consecutively, substan-
tially increased the risk of host death (single infection vs. MI
or PIA: v2
1,63 = 21.01, P < 0.0001; Table S4; Fig. S4, for sur-
vival temporal dynamics). This is in keeping with reports that
mixed-species infections of P. falciparum and P. vivax more
often lead to severe disease symptoms in human malaria cases
(Genton et al. 2008). Weight loss and anaemia differed signifi-
cantly across treatments (minimum RBC count: F4,63 = 6.2,
P < 0.0001; minimum weight: F4,63 = 4.15, P < 0.01) and this
was driven by mice in the HIC becoming less anaemic and
losing less weight than mice in PIA and AA treatment groups
(Fig. 4b,c; all other pairwise comparisons between treatments

sity and minimum weight; Table S5).
The high mortality in the parasite-induced anaemia and

weight

or
anaemia
(minimum

v2
1,20 = 0.18,
P = 0.67; minimum RBC density: v2

Instead, we found a significant positive correlation between
the mean proportion of RBC throughout infections which
were
reticulocytes
and
the
probability
of
surviving
(v2
1,22 = 15.2, P < 0.0001; Fig. 4d). We also found an effect
of
treatment
(PIA
vs.
mixed:
v2
1,22 = 8.38,
P < 0.005;
Table S6): mice with a simultaneous mixed infection had a
higher probability of survival at a given reticulocyte propor-
tion than mice in the parasite-induced anaemia treatment
(Fig. 4d). We conclude that hosts face a trade-off: the produc-
tion of new RBCs facilitates replication of P. yoelii, but new
RBCs must be produced in large numbers to survive and
recover from infection.
The RBC specialist benefits when an RBC generalist is below a
prevalence threshold
Motivated by our experimental results, we defined the fitness
of RBC-specialist (e.g. P. yoelii) parasites infecting the three
host classes in our heuristic model. As a proxy for fitness,
we used the ‘transmission potential’ of an infection, which is
the product of the duration of infection and infectiousness
(Fraser et al. 2014). We took the na€
ıve host as the baseline
case: if the RBC specialist infects a host of type C, we define
the rate at which it transmits from that host as B and the
duration of infection as D. We allowed RBC-specialist para-
sites in hosts recovering from an RBC-generalist infection
(e.g. PIA treatment group) to gain the replication benefit
observed in our experimental work as well as suffer the
reduced survival we observed, whereas RBC-specialist para-
sites in hosts with an active RBC-generalist infection (e.g.
MI group) suffer reduced survival with no replication bene-
fit. We assume that the increase in replication translates to
an increase in transmission: whereas malaria parasites pro-
duce specialised stages for transmission and may alter the
rate at which they do this over the course of an infection
(Reece et al. 2009, 2010; Pollitt et al. 2011; Carter et al.
2013), all else being equal, an increase in replication will
result in the production of more transmission stages. Thus,
we denote the benefit of facilitation, i.e. the proportional
increase in transmission, as f. Finally, we approximate the
decreased survival as a decrease in the duration of infection
and define a as the proportional reduction in the duration
of infection. The fitness of the RBC specialist in the different
host classes is therefore,

 wC ¼ BD;
wMI ¼ ð1 � aÞBD;
wPIA ¼ ð1 � aÞð1 þ f ÞBD:
Substituting these expressions into eqn 1, we found that the
average fitness of an RBC specialist in a host population
where the RBC generalist is circulating is thus
�
w ¼ BDð1 � /a þ fð1 � aÞð/ � wÞÞ:
ð2Þ
By dividing this expression by BD (i.e. the fitness of the
RBC specialist in the absence of the RBC-generalist), we
obtain an expression for the relative fitness of the RBC-spe-
cialist parasite in the presence vs. absence of the RBC
generalist,
�
wrel ¼ 1 � /a þ fð1 � aÞð/ � wÞ:
ð3Þ
In Fig. 5, we explore how relative fitness changes with the
prevalence and seroprevalence of the RBC generalist, across a
range of costs and benefits to the RBC specialist. This figure
demonstrates that the RBC specialist only benefits when the
prevalence of the RBC generalist is below a threshold. Specifi-
cally, if
1 � /a þ fð1 � aÞð/ � wÞ [ 1;
ð4Þ
then the RBC specialist benefits from the RBC generalist cir-
culating in the host population. By rearranging this inequality,
we find the equation of the dashed lines in Figure 5,
w\
�
1 �

ð5Þ
which gives the maximum prevalence of active generalist infec-
tion for which the RBC specialist will have higher fitness than
in the absense of the RBC generalist. With some rearrange-
ments and substitutions, we can rewrite eqn 4 as
pPIA
pPIA þ pMI
fð1 � aÞ [ a
which has an interpretation that is familiar in evolutionary
biology [Hamilton’s rule (Hamilton 1964a,b)]: the benefit from
the RBC generalist multiplied by the probability of receiving
that benefit (facilitation) must be greater than the cost.
From Fig. 5, we also see that the fitness of the RBC specialist
always decreases with increasing prevalence of the RBC gener-
alist, which can also be shown by differentiating eqn 3 with
respect to w (i.e. the derivative is always negative). Of course,
when prevalence changes, so will seroprevalence and the conse-
quences of this for the fitness of the RBC specialist depend crit-
ically on the costs and benefits of facilitation. For example,
assuming that a unit change in prevalence leads to an identical
unit change in seroprevalence, then when costs are high but
benefits are low (a = 0.75, f = 3.5), increasing prevalence and
seroprevalence leads to substantial reductions in fitness, whereas
fitness reductions are more modest for other parameter combi-
nations. Therefore, control measures aimed specifically at an
RBC-generalist malaria parasite may temporarily increase sero-
prevalence while decreasing prevalence, which would generate a
fitness advantage to an RBC specialist, and could therefore lead
to transient increases in infections with those parasites.
In reality, what matters for RBC-specialist fitness is not the
prevalence of the generalist per se, but the likelihood that infec-
tions with the RBC generalist have progressed to the point of
altering the within-host environment sufficiently to facilitate
the RBC specialist upon its arrival in the host. Additional data
would be useful for defining the transitions between host
classes in a fully dynamical expansion of the model presented
here (or understanding the relationship between seroprevalence
and prevalence in our heuristic model). More mechanistic
models (e.g. Mcqueen & Mckenzie 2006) parameterised with
such data would be valuable for revealing subtleties in the
interactions between Plasmodium species that may explain

Figure 5 A RBC specialist can benefit from facilitation up to a threshold prevalence of a RBC generalist. Plots indicate the relative fitness of an RBC-
specialist parasite (e.g. P. yoelii) in the presence vs. the absence of an RBC generalist (e.g. P. chabaudi) over a range of costs, a, and benefits, f, of
facilitation. Plotted values are the logged solutions to eqn 3. Within the yellow parameter space the specialist benefits from the generalist. In the blue
parameter space the specialist does worse than it would alone. Note that the fitness of the generalist always decreases as the prevalence of the specialist
increases. The white region reflects the fact that prevalence must be less than or equal to seroprevalence; parameter combinations above the one-to-one line
are not plausible. The dashed line highlights the maximum prevalence (for a given seroprevalence) that obtains a benefit for P. yoelli fitness, given by
inequality (5).

 epidemiological patterns and predict off-target consequences of
interventions aimed at one species alone.
From mice to men
We show that, by altering the within-host environment, an
RBC-generalist parasite can facilitate the replication of an
RBC specialist and bottom-up processes are the main drivers
in this interaction. Experimental manipulations of the kind
reported here are, for obvious reasons, not possible with
human malaria, and in natural transmission settings it is likely
that patterns will be complicated further by previous infection
histories and the ability of an RBC specialist (P. vivax) to sur-
vive as dormant stages in the host (Mueller et al. 2009). How-
ever, we suggest that in the many areas where P. vivax is
circulating within the same host population as an RBC gener-
alist
(P.
falciparum),
within-host
interactions,
mediated
through changes in host resources, are likely to impact upon
both parasite replication and host health. In particular, in
areas where P. falciparum transmission is low, or in areas with
recent outbreaks, we predict that P. vivax has higher fitness
than in populations where it circulates alone. Our results also
suggest that co-infections of an RBC specialist and RBC gen-
eralist are highly virulent. This may come as a surprise
because P. vivax is assumed to be comparatively benign, but
recent studies do show that co-infections of P. falciparum and
P. vivax can result in a higher incidence of severe malaria and
severe anaemia than either species alone (Genton et al. 2008;
Tjitra et al. 2008). Our model also suggests P. vivax faces
some surprising consequences of interventions targeting P. fal-
ciparum. If the prevalence of P. falciparum is high, a reduction
in its prevalence could push the system into the parameter
space where P. vivax benefits most from facilitation, generat-
ing more secondary infections than if P. vivax circulated
alone. Of course, the reduced mortality and morbidity associ-
ated with a reduction in P. falciparum infections may well
outweigh the clinical costs of an increase in the number of P.
vivax infections. Whether patterns of P. vivax prevalence and
pathogenesis fit these expectations requires urgent study.
CONCLUSIONS
Our results highlight the importance of resource feedbacks in
the interactions between co-infecting species and the conse-
quences of these interactions for host health and parasite epi-
demiology.
Furthermore,
our
results
suggest
that
both
parasite abundance and host survival correlate with the fre-
quency, but not the density of the preferred age of RBCs in
rodent malaria infections. A similar observation has recently
been made for co-infections of the nematode Nippostrongylus
brasiliensis and P. chabaudi, in which the frequency, not den-
sity, of preferred RBCs is an important predictor of infection
success (Griffiths et al. 2015).
