Objective To examine how receiving or being denied a wanted abortion affects the subsequent development,
health, caregiving, and socioeconomics of women’s existing children at time of seeking abortion.
Study design The Turnaway Study is a 5-year longitudinal study with a quasi-experimental design. Women were
recruited from January 2008 to December 2010 from 30 abortion facilities throughout the US. We interviewed women
regarding the health and development of their living children via telephone 1 week after seeking an abortion and
semiannually for 5 years. We compare the youngest existing children younger than the age 5 years of women denied
abortion because they presented for care beyond a facility’s gestational limit (Turnaway group) with those of women
who received the abortion (Abortion group). We used mixed-effects regression models to test for differences in
outcomes of existing children of women in the Turnaway group (n = 55 children) compared with existing children
of women in the Abortion group (n = 293 children).
Results From 6 months to 4.5 years after their mothers sought abortions, existing children of women denied abor-
tions had lower mean child development scores (adjusted b −0.04, 95% CI −0.07 to −0.00) and were more likely
to live below the Federal Poverty Level (aOR 3.74, 95% CI 1.59-8.79) than the children of women who received a
wanted abortion. There were no significant differences in child health or time spent with a caregiver other than the
mother.
Conclusions Denying women a wanted abortion may have negative developmental and socioeconomic conse-
quences for their existing children. (J Pediatr 2019;205:183-9).
A
pproximately 60% of women in the US who have abortions are already mothers.1 Approximately one-third of women
seeking an abortion say that their reason for wanting to terminate the pregnancy is to care for children they already
have.2,3
The Turnaway Study was designed to examine the consequences of terminating an unwanted pregnancy vs carrying it to term.
We followed 956 women for 5 years, all of whom sought an abortion at 1 of 30 abortion facilities across the country. Some of
the women in the study received the abortion, and some were denied the wanted abortion. Other findings from this study have
indicated that being denied an abortion places women at greater risk of anxiety, stress, and low self-esteem at the time of being
denied an abortion; however, mental health symptoms improve over time whether or not the woman received the abortion.4-7
Women from this study who were denied abortions were more likely to live in poverty,8 to raise children alone, to stay tethered
to an abusive partner,9 and were less likely to have and achieve aspirational plans for the future,10 compared with women who
obtained the wanted abortion. These factors may affect the home environment and resources available to children in the family
and therefore may affect the well-being of existing children in the home. In this article, we investigate the effect of being denied
an abortion on the health and development of women’s existing children at the time of abortion-seeking by comparing the
outcomes of existing children of women who received vs were denied a wanted abortion.
Methods
The Turnaway Study is a 5-year, longitudinal telephone-interview study of the effects
of receiving vs being denied abortion on women’s physical health, mental health,
and socioeconomic well-being, as well as those of their children. Details have been
published previously.11 The study was approved by the Committee for Human Re-
search at the University of California, San Francisco.
Study participants included English- and Spanish-speaking women aged 15 or
older, with no known fetal anomalies or demise, presenting for abortion care between

 2008 and 2010 at 30 facilities throughout the US. Recruit-
ment facilities were selected based on the criterion that they
had the latest gestational limit of any other facility within 150
miles. We identified facilities using the National Abortion Fed-
eration directory and contacts within the abortion research
community.Women were recruited into 1 of 3 designated study
groups in a 2:1:1 ratio based on the gestational age limit of the
facility: 1) women receiving an abortion up to 2 weeks under
a facility’s gestational limit, 2) women who received a first-
trimester abortion, and 3) women who were denied an abor-
tion with gestations up to 3 weeks over a facility’s limit.
For this analysis, we compared the outcomes of the exist-
ing children of all women in the study who received an abor-
tion (Abortion group) regardless of original study group with
the outcomes of existing children whose mothers were denied
the abortion and carried the pregnancy to term (Turnaway
group). Women in the Turnaway group who went on to have
an abortion elsewhere were included in the Abortion group.
Previous analyses have shown that women who received an
abortion elsewhere after being turned away were, on average,
a month earlier in pregnancy8; they were less likely to be Latina
and also less likely to have had a difficult time deciding to have
the abortion than women in the Turnaway group who carried
their pregnancies to term.12 Women were interviewed by tele-
phone 8 days after seeking the abortion and then every 6
months for 5 years.
Measures
We collected data on child development, health, socioeco-
nomic well-being, and caregiving of women’s youngest living
child younger than age 5 years at 1 week after abortion-
seeking and every 6 months through 4 years. Child develop-
ment was assessed using the Parents’ Evaluation of
Developmental Status: Developmental Milestones (PEDS:DM)
instrument.13 The PEDS:DM is a parent-reported screening and
surveillance tool for children ages birth to 8 years to assess 6
age-specific measures of child development: fine motor, re-
ceptive language, expressive language, gross motor, self-help,
andsocialemotional.Weusedlongitudinalreportsfrommothers
to assess whether the child achieved each milestone (yes/no),
as well as an overall percentage across the 6 milestones. Child
health included any diagnoses and recent attacks of asthma,
physical disabilities, and injuries severe enough to consider
seeking medical attention. Caregiving was assessed by asking
whether the child lived with the mother; hours per week the
child spent with other caregivers; and, for children ages 3 and
4 years, whether they attended preschool. Finally, measures to
assesschild’ssocioeconomicwell-beingincludedquestionsabout
the mother and the household: whether the mother lived with
adult family members, with a male partner, or on her own
(without a male partner or adult family members) and whether
the mother received public assistance from theWomen,Infants,
and Children program,Temporary Assistance for Needy Fami-
lies (TANF),and Supplemental NutritionalAssistance Program,
also known as food stamps. We calculated poverty based on
eachsurveycalendaryear’sfederalpovertythreshold,thenumber
of peoplesharingexpensesinthehousehold,andthetotalhouse-
hold income, including public assistance. We measured sub-
jective poverty by asking the woman whether she had enough
money to meet basic living needs, such as food, housing, and
transportation in the previous month. We dichotomized this
outcome to indicate women who reported that they did not
always have enough money to cover basic living expenses.
Our primary independent variable was analytic group
(Turnaway vs Abortion). We also included baseline covariates
that could confound the relationship between the analytic group
and child outcomes. Child-specific covariates included birth
order (first, second, third, and fourth or greater), sex, pres-
ence of a physical disability at baseline, and a time-varying
measure of child age. Maternal covariates were all measured
at baseline and included age, self-reported race/ethnicity (white,
black, Hispanic/Latina, and other), education (less than high
school, high school/General Educational Development, and
more than high school/General Educational Development), and
union status (married, cohabitating, never married and not
cohabiting, previously married and not cohabiting).
Statistical Analyses
We used mixed-effects linear and logistic regression to test for
baseline analytic group differences in mothers’ and youngest
existing children’s characteristics at the time of abortion-
seeking, with random effects for site. We assessed differences
in child development, health, caregiving, and socioeconomic
status over the 5-year study period by analytic group (exist-
ing children in the Turnaway vs Abortion group). Specifi-
cally, we compared outcomes of the youngest existing child to
each woman beginning at the 6-month interview (after mothers
in the Turnaway group gave birth) and continuing at each sub-
sequent interview until the last existing child reached age 5 years.
We present the results of the adjusted analyses for all out-
comes, with the exception of physical disabilities, because the
number of children with physical disabilities was too small to
fit adjusted models. All analyses accounted for clustering by
site and multiple observations per child over time with random
effects. Analyses were performed using Stata 14 (StataCorp,
College Station, Texas).14 Statistical tests are reported at P < .10
and P < .05 using 2-tailed tests. For models in which the ad-
justed model showed significant differences between the Abor-
tion and Turnaway groups, we report marginal predicted
probabilities generated from the adjusted model.
For all analyses, we omitted existing children whose mother
did not complete more than the first interview (n = 26) and
existing children (n = 50) from 1 site where nearly all women
who were turned away went on to get an abortion elsewhere
(Figure). Given the unique health risks for twin births,15 we
also excluded twins (n = 14). In the main analyses, we also ex-
cluded existing children of women in the Turnaway group who
reported that they had a miscarriage (n = 4) or who placed the
new child for adoption (n = 7). As a sensitivity check, we tested
whether there were substantive differences in the results if we
separated the Abortion group into Near-Limit, First Trimes-
ter, and Turnaways who did not give birth (those who placed
the child for adoption, miscarried, or went on to receive an
abortion elsewhere).

 Results
A total of 37.5% (1132/3016) of eligible participants ap-
proached consented to participate. Overall, 956 women seeking
abortions completed baseline interviews between January 2008
and December 2010.At the time of seeking abortion, 603 (63%)
women reported at least one living existing child, and 449 were
younger than age 5 years. Among the 210 mothers in the
Turnaway group who were interviewed, 44 (21%) received an
abortion elsewhere. The final sample of observations of ex-
isting children in this analysis includes 1944 semiannual data
points for 348 children. This includes 293 children of mothers
in the Abortion group (180 from the Near-Limit group, 14 from
women who were initially denied an abortion but received one
elsewhere, and 99 from First-Trimesters) and 55 children of
mothers in the Turnaway group.
Baseline Characteristics
At the time of the baseline survey, 8 days after receipt or denial
of abortion, the average age of youngest existing children at
or younger than age 4.5 years was 2.1 years (range 4 months
to 4.5 years) (Table I). Forty-three percent were only chil-
dren, 29% were the second child, and 28% had a higher birth
order. There were no statistically significant baseline differ-
ences by analytic group in any child demographic character-
istics, child development, child health, caregiving, and most
socioeconomic outcomes, except mothers in the Turnaway
group were more likely than mothers in the Abortion group
to report that they did not always have enough money to pay
for food, housing, and transportation (P < .05).
Differences by Analytic Group from 6 Months to
5 Years Postabortion-Seeking
By 6 months, all women in the Turnaway group had given birth.
The mean child development score from 6 months to 5 years
among existing children in the Turnaway group was 4 per-
centage points lower than that of the existing children of women
in the Abortion group (73% vs 77% of milestones achieved,
ab −0.04, 95% CI −0.07 to −0.003) (Table II). Self-help was
the only 1 of the 6 individual child development domains that
was significantly different by analytic group in adjusted models:
existing children of women in the Turnaway group were less
likely to achieve self-help milestones compared with existing
children of women in the Abortion group (59% vs 93%,
aOR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.97).
In terms of the existing child’s health, we found no signifi-
cant differences in frequency of reported injuries or in epi-
sodes of asthma by analytic group in adjusted analyses
(Table II). In unadjusted analyses, the proportions of exist-
ing children with physical disabilities were not significantly dif-
ferent by group.
There were no differences by analytic group in the odds that
existing children lived with their mothers or in hours spent
with other caregivers. Among 3- and 4-year-old children, ex-
isting children of women in the Turnaway group were more
likely to attend preschool (56% vs 45%, aOR 2.25, 95% CI 1.02-
4.95) than children of mothers in the Abortion group.
We found significant differences in socioeconomic well-
being by analytic group (Table II). Existing children of women
in the Turnaway group had more than 3 times greater odds
of living in a household that received assistance from the
Women, Infants, and Children program (aOR 3.66, 95% CI
1.97-6.79) and TANF (19% vs 10% receiving TANF, aOR 5.34,
95% CI 1.64-17.42,) and also greater odds of living in a house-
hold below the Federal Poverty Level (72% vs 55%, aOR 3.74,
95% CI 1.59-8.79) compared with children of women who re-
ceived an abortion. The household income relative to Federal
Poverty Level was lower among children of women in the
Turnaway group (115% vs 83% of the Federal Poverty Level,
ab −0.32, 95% CI −0.54 to −0.10) than among children of
women who received the abortion. Existing children were more
likely to live in a household in which their mother reported
not having enough money to pay for food, housing, and trans-
portation if their mother was denied vs received the abor-
tion (87% vs 70%, aOR 6.13, 95% CI 2.47-15.22).

Effects of Carrying an Unwanted Pregnancy to Term on Women’s Existing Children
 Results from sensitivity analyses, in which we examined the
original abortion study groups (Near-Limits and First-
Trimesters) separately instead of combining them into 1 Abor-
tion group were similar in direction, magnitude, and
significance for all but 2 outcomes (Table III; available at
www.jpeds.com). Although analytic group differences for self-
help and overall mean child development were similar in
direction, the differences were no longer statistically signifi-
cant at a P < .05 level (P = .067 and P = .074, respectively).
Discussion
Women’s concerns that having another child may affect their
ability to care for existing children are supported by a limited,

 yet growing body of empirical evidence demonstrating adverse
effects of unintended childbearing, both for the child result-
ing from an unintended pregnancy, as well as for older
siblings.16-21 This study prospectively assessed the effects of access
to wanted abortion care on women’s existing children. We
found slightly lower child development scores and poorer so-
cioeconomic well-being for the existing children of women
denied abortions compared with children whose mothers re-
ceived an abortion. These 2 major findings may be linked. Di-
minished resources may lead to slowed development, as is
supported by the resource-dilution model.22-24 A mother who
is stressed may invest less in her children, emotionally and fi-
nancially. That existing children of women denied abortion were
more likely to live in poorer households is commensurate with
previous research from this same study on the effects of abor-
tion denial on women.8 Although increases in preschool at-
tendance among existing children in the Turnaway group may
help to counterbalance some of the effect of diminished fi-
nancial well-being on their development, we find that any such
benefit is not sufficient to keep development scores on par with
the children of women who received an abortion.
This study has several limitations. The sample size of ex-
isting children at time of abortion-seeking is small in this
study and did not allow us to examine how outcomes varied
over time. We only collected data on the youngest existing
child, which limits our ability to detect effects on other children
in the family. We may not have been sufficiently powered to
detect differences in all the outcomes we measured. Further,
we test many outcomes within 4 domains—socioeconomic,
development, health, and caregiving—raising the possibility
of a type I error. However, the consistency of findings within
the socioeconomic and development domains are reassur-
ing. Our measure of child development, the PEDS:DM, is
primarily used as a screening tool in clinic settings, rather
than in research, and we do not know whether the small
measured differences in development are good indicators of
these children’s long-term well-being. The apparent differ-
ences in subjective poverty at the baseline interview may be
due to the fact that the first interview took place 1 week after
the woman learned that she was going to have a/another
child, so she may have had a heightened sense of inadequate
income. Yet, given the small number of children under study,
our significant findings on child development and poverty
are particularly striking. Future study should include all ex-
isting children and follow more women to examine whether
the results vary by age of the existing child or are concen-
trated in specific ages.
There are 2 mechanisms by which older siblings may be af-
fected by a subsequent unintended pregnancy carried to term.
The resource-dilution model posits that parents’ time, money,
and energy are finite, so as the number of children in a family
increases, resources allocated to any one child decline,

Effects of Carrying an Unwanted Pregnancy to Term on Women’s Existing Children
 ultimately impacting outcomes of all children in the
household.22-24 A second mechanism suggests that apart from
the effects of family size, the occurrence of an unintended preg-
nancy carried to term may negatively impact the woman. These
impacts may result from the woman’s greater stress or de-
pression associated with the unintended pregnancy mea-
sured during the pregnancy,25,26 in the perinatal period,27 or
beyond.20,28 These adverse effects have been shown to extend
beyond the woman to the child resulting from the unin-
tended pregnancy, as well as her existing children, via lower-
quality mother–child relationships20,29,30 more physical
punishment of children,20 a deterioration of the home envi-
ronment,31 and an increase in behavioral problems among boys
whose younger sibling was unintended.31
Efforts to examine the extent of the effects of unintended
childbearing on existing children, however, have been ham-
pered by 3 main methodologic challenges. First, to isolate the
effect of being born from unintended pregnancies, these chil-
dren often are compared with children born from intended
pregnancies. However, the differences in child well-being re-
sulting from this comparison could be confounded by factors
such as the pregnant woman’s circumstances—financial, health,
or relationship status, for example, that might lead to both poor
child outcomes, as well as to the increased likelihood of having
an unintended pregnancy or of retrospectively reporting a preg-
nancy as unintended.
Second, efforts to control for these confounding factors have
compared siblings, one from an unintended pregnancy and one
from an intended pregnancy, within the same family. This ap-
proach, however, may underestimate the effect of unin-
tended pregnancy if there are negative spillover effects from
the unintended pregnancy to the other children in the family.19,31
If other children in the family are negatively affected by the
unintended pregnancy, what is perceived as a family effect may
actually be a consequence of the unintended pregnancy. To
prevent spillover effects, in this study we compared existing
children, otherwise similar, who did and did not experience
an additional sibling from an unintended pregnancy.
Lastly, “unintended pregnancy”—the broad term includ-
ing both unwanted and mistimed pregnancy and most often
used in previous studies—is an inherently complex phenom-
enon to measure. Women may have mixed or ambivalent feel-
ings toward pregnancy,32,33 and these feelings may change over
the course of pregnancy and after childbirth.34 Despite its com-
plexity, many studies examining unintended pregnancy rely on
crude, retrospective measures that are likely to lead to
misclassification of “unintended” pregnancy and underesti-
mate any associated consequences. This small study has over-
come these methodologic challenges to detect an effect on
existing children by whether their mother received or was
denied a wanted abortion. This study shows that the effect of
a birth following an unwanted pregnancy may not just redound
to the child born from that pregnancy; there may also be nega-
tive effects on existing children. These findings support the le-
gitimacy of women’s concerns about the effect of carrying an
unwanted pregnancy to term on the well-being of their exist-
ing children.
Until now, research on the effects of denial of wanted abor-
tion has focused on women and the child born as a result of
abortion denial.17,35 This study, in contrast, highlights the po-
tential negative effects on existing children of women who are
denied a wanted abortion, underscoring women’s own con-
cerns about the well-being of their families when faced with
the prospect of carrying an unintended pregnancy to term. We
find small negative effects on existing children’s develop-
ment and an increased chance of living in poverty among chil-
dren whose mothers were denied rather than obtained a wanted
abortion. ■
