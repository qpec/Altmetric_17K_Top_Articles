SUMMARY
Neuronal subtype is largely fixed in the adult mammalian brain. Here, however, we unexpectedly reveal that adult mouse striatal neurons
can be reprogrammed into dopaminergic neuron-like cells (iDALs). This in vivo phenotypic reprogramming can be promoted by a stem
cell factor (SOX2), three dopaminergic neuron-enriched transcription regulators (NURR1, LMX1A, and FOXA2), and a chemical com-
pound (valproic acid). Although the site of action of the reprogramming factors remains to be determined, immunohistochemistry
and genetic lineage mappings confirm striatal neurons as the cell origin for iDALs. iDALs exhibit electrophysiological properties stereo-
typical to endogenous dopaminergic rather than striatal neurons. Together, these results indicate that neuronal phenotype can be reen-
gineered even in the adult brain, implicating a therapeutic strategy for neurological diseases.
INTRODUCTION
Neuron replacement may have medical implications for
neural injury and neurological diseases. Except for a few
defined niches (Bond et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2008), how-
ever, neuron-producing progenitors do not exist in most
regions of the adult mammalian central nervous system.
Very interestingly, recent data rather reveal that ectopic
SOX2 can reprogram resident glial cells into neural pro-
genitors in both the adult mouse brain and spinal cord
(Niu et al., 2013, 2015; Su et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016;
Wang and Zhang, 2018). These induced progenitors
expand locally and give rise to mature neurons with
network integration.
Resident glial cells in the adult mouse brain or retina
can also be directly converted into neurons with ectopic
expression of a single or a combination of fate-determining
factors. These include Neurod1, Neurog2, Olig2, Sox2, Ascl1,
Brn2, Myt1l, etc. (Buffo et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2015;
Gascon et al., 2016; Grande et al., 2013; Guo et al., 2014;
Heinrich et al., 2014; Jorstad et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2015;
Pereira et al., 2017; Rivetti di Val Cervo et al., 2017; Smith
et al., 2016a; Smith et al., 2016b; Smith and Zhang, 2015;
Torper et al., 2015; Torper et al., 2013). Some of these
glia-converted neurons show electrophysiological proper-
ties of mature neurons and form synaptic connections.
In contrast to glial cells that can become reactive and pro-
liferate under certain conditions, postmitotic neurons do
not normally change their identity for the lifespan of the
organism. Notwithstanding, ectopic Fezf2 can switch the
subtype of certain early postmitotic neurons in the mouse
brain. Such subtype reprogramming is restricted to the first
postnatal week, indicating a critical window of neuronal
plasticity (De la Rossa et al., 2013; Rouaux and Arlotta,
2013). In this study, we sought to induce new dopami-
nergic (DA) neurons through SOX2-mediated cell fate re-
programming in vivo. However, we unexpectedly identified
that striatal neurons but not glial cells in the adult mouse
brain can be induced into a phenotype resembling DA
neurons, greatly expanding our knowledge on neuronal
plasticity.
RESULTS
Induction of Dopaminergic Neuron-like Cells in the
Adult Mouse Striatum
DA neurons are critical for movement coordination and
motivated behavior and are frequently lost in Parkinson
disease (Lindvall and Bjorklund, 2011; Palmiter, 2008).
In vivo generation of new DA neurons may have broad ap-
plications including therapeutic potentials. We previously
showed that ectopic SOX2 could reprogram striatal glia
into neural progenitors, which then further became mature
neurons when the mice were treated with the small mole-
cule valproic acid (VPA) (Niu et al., 2013, 2015). To deter-
mine whether any of these induced neurons were DA neu-
rons, immunohistochemistry was performed by using an
antibody against the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine
synthesis, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Antibody specificity
for TH was verified since it can clearly detect the somas of
DA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc)
and their projections in the striatum (Figure S1). A system-
atic survey, however, failed to detect any induced TH+ cells

 in the core striatal regions that were injected with the
SOX2-expressing virus, although DCX+ cells were clearly
observed indicating SOX2-mediated neuronal reprogram-
ming (Figure 1A).
Therefore,
we
screened
additional
fate-determining
transcription factors that could facilitate SOX2 to induce
new TH+ cells in the adult striatum. Immunohistochem-
istry was initially conducted at 8 weeks post injection of
virus (wpi). This time point was chosen so that only sur-
vived and mature neurons would be detected. Whereas
the inclusion of GSX2, DLX2, EBF1, EGR1, or ASCL1 had
no any effect, the combination of SOX2 with either
FOXA2, LMX1A, or NURR1 induced some striatal cells
with TH+ somas (Figure S2A). Very interestingly, a larger
number of TH+ somas was observed when combining all
those factors that showed a positive effect (Figures 1B
and 1C; n = 3 mice per group; group effect by one-way
ANOVA: F(10,22) = 7.345 and p < 0.0001). These factors
include SOX2, three DA neuron-restricted transcription
factors (DA3: NURR1, FOXA2, and LMX1A), and the
small-molecule VPA. Removing any one of these factors
from the combination reduced the number of neurons
with TH+ somas in the striatum (Figure 1C). For simplicity,
this combination of factors is hereafter referred to as iDAL
factors, and the induced striatal cells with TH+ somas as
iDALs.
A time course analysis showed that iDALs were detectable
at 2 wpi and their number gradually increased at later time
Figure 1. A Combination of Factors Induces iDALs in the Adult Mouse Striatum
(A) In vivo reprogramming by SOX2 and VPA is not sufficient for iDALs. TH+ somas were not detected in striatal regions injected with SOX2
virus and treated with VPA when analyzed at 8 wpi (weeks post injection of virus; n > 3 mice). Induced DCX+ neurons were used as controls
for SOX2-dependent in vivo reprogramming activity. Cell nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Hst). Scale bar, 20 mm.

 points (Figure 1D; n = 3–4 mice per group; time effect by
one-way ANOVA: F(5,14) = 101.7 and p < 0.0001). It should
be noted that the numbers of iDALs varied between exper-
iments (Figures 1C and 1D). Such quantitative differences
might originate from normal variations between indepen-
dent experiments, such as slight changes on virus quality
and titers. Interestingly, induced calretinin (CR)+ cells
were also observed in the virus-injected striatal regions
and they were frequently intermingled with iDALs (Fig-
ure S2B). These induced CR+ cells were likely due to the re-
programming activity of SOX2 and VPA, as we had shown
previously (Niu et al., 2015).
iDALs Do Not Pass through a Proliferative Progenitor
Stage
SOX2-mediated in vivo reprogramming passes through a
proliferative ASCL1+ progenitor stage (Niu et al., 2013,
2015; Wang et al., 2016). To determine whether cell prolif-
eration was also involved in iDALs, we systemically treated
the mice with either bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-contain-
ing drinking water (Figure 2A) or through twice daily
intraperitoneal BrdU injections (Figure 2B). These BrdU
treatments covered all the time periods immediately after
virus injections until analysis by immunohistochemistry
at 8 wpi. iDALs were examined by immunostainings of
TH and BrdU. Unexpectedly, none of the iDALs were co-
labeled with BrdU (Figures 2A and 2B; n = 0 BrdU+TH+ cells
from a total of six mice).
SOX2-induced neural progenitors and their progenies
in the adult striatum could be traced in Ascl1-CreERT2;
Rosa-tdTomato (tdT) mice (Niu et al., 2015). The reporter
tdT was induced by treating the mice with tamoxifen
(Tam) at 3 wpi. Cell fate was analyzed at 12 wpi (Figure 2C).
Consistent with our previous results (Niu et al., 2015), tdT+
neurons were induced in striatal regions injected with the
reprogramming factors (Figure 2C). However, none of the
TH+ iDALs were labeled by tdT in the same striatal region
(Figure 2C; n = 0 tdT+TH+ cells from a total of four mice).
Together, these results indicate that iDALs are directly
induced from non-proliferative cells and do not originate
from SOX2-induced or any endogenous ASCL1+ neural
progenitors.

 iDALs Do Not Originate from Resident Glial Cells or
Progenitors in the Subventricular Zone
Resident astrocytes or NG2 glia can be reprogrammed into
neurons (Guo et al., 2014; Heinrich et al., 2014; Niu et al.,
2013; Pereira et al., 2017; Torper et al., 2013, 2015). We
used the Pdgfra-CreERT;Rosa-tdT mice to trace NG2 glia
and their lineages (Kang et al., 2010). Permanent reporter
expression in NG2 glia was induced through Tam adminis-
tration in the adult mice (Figure 3A). iDALs were deter-
mined by immunostaining of TH+ somas in the virus-in-
jected striatal region at 8 wpi. Interestingly, none of the
iDALs were labeled by the reporter tdT (n = 0 tdT+TH+ cells
from three mice), indicating that iDALs do not come from
resident NG2 glia.
The mGfap-Cre;Rosa-tdT transgenic mouse line was then
employed to genetically trace astrocytes and their con-
verted neurons (Niu et al., 2013). Approximately 98% of
the striatal astrocytes was shown to be traced in this line
(Niu et al., 2013). In addition to astrocytes, neural progen-
itors in the subventricular zone could also be labeled in
this Cre line (Figure S3) (Gregorian et al., 2009). Adult
transgenic mice were injected with iDAL factor-expressing
virus and treated with VPA (Figure 3B). iDALs were then
examined for expression of TH and tdT at 8 wpi. Very

 unexpectedly, none of the TH+ iDALs were labeled by the
reporter tdT, even though they were intermingled with
tdT+ astrocytes in the same striatal region (Figure 3B;
n = 0 tdT+TH+ cells from three mice). Low-magnification
images also showed that iDALs were found in injected
striatal regions far away from the subventricular zone (Fig-
ure S4), excluding the likelihood that iDALs could be orig-
inated from this neurogenic zone through cell migration.
Together, these results clearly indicate that neither resident
glial cells nor neural progenitors in the neurogenic subven-
tricular zone are a cell source for iDALs.
iDALs Originate from Local Striatal Neurons
We finally postulated that iDALs might come from local
neurons through phenotypic reprogramming. To tempo-
rally trace neurons and their derivatives, we used the
Tam-inducible
PrP-CreERT;Rosa-tdT reporter
mice
(Niu
et al., 2013). Approximately 80% of preexisting striatal
neurons could be permanently labeled by repetitive Tam
injections once per day for 7 days (Figure S5A). The adult
reporter mice were then injected with virus expressing
the iDAL factors and treated with VPA in drinking water.
When analyzed at 8 wpi, about 79% of iDALs were found
to be labeled by tdT+, indicating that they came from
endogenous striatal neurons (Figures 4A and S5B; n = 206
tdT+TH+ cells out of 259 TH+ cells from three mice).
Immunohistochemistry
was
further
conducted
to
examine marker expression for medium spiny neurons
(MSNs), which are the predominant neuronal subtype in
the striatum (Arlotta et al., 2008). These neurons can be
identified by expression of DARPP32 (dopamine- and
cAMP-regulated neuronal phosphoprotein) and CTIP2
(also known as BCL11b) (Arlotta et al., 2008). Very interest-
ingly, these two markers were clearly detectable in iDALs
(Figures 4B and 4C). Such a staining pattern was in sharp
contrast to those endogenous DA neurons in the SNc,
which completely lacked the expression of these two
markers. Collectively, these data indicate that iDALs
come from local striatal neurons.
We then examined whether striatal MSNs had the viral
SOX2 expression, since it was driven by the hGFAP pro-
moter that mainly targets resident astrocytes (Lee et al.,
2008). We used the hGFAP-GFP-T2A-SOX2 lentivirus to ex-
press SOX2 and hGFAP-GFP as a control. Endogenous stria-
tal neurons were detected by DARPP32 and CTIP2. Consis-
tent with our previously published data (Niu et al., 2013),
the result showed that about 10% of the striatal neurons
could be transduced by the lentivirus in addition to a ma-
jority of astrocytes (Figure S6A). The GFP-SOX2 was then
used in combination with DA3 factors to induce iDALs in
the adult mouse striatum. Interestingly, not all TH+ iDALs
were marked by GFP-SOX2 (Figure S6B), which might be
consistent with the results that iDALs could also be
induced in the absence of SOX2 (Figures 1B and 1C). It
could also be possible that GFP-SOX2 is downregulated in
some iDALs or that the reprogramming factors might
have non-cell-autonomous effects on the appearance of
iDALs. The site of action of the reprogramming factors re-
mains to be determined.
iDALs Express Markers Stereotypical to DA Neurons
The detection of markers for striatal neurons in iDALs
raised a possibility that these neurons might merely express
TH but lack of other properties typical to functional DA
neurons. As such, we examined additional subtype-specific
markers. Dopa decarboxylase (DDC), also known as aro-
matic L-amino acid decarboxylase, is a key downstream
enzyme of TH that is required for dopamine synthesis.
Membrane-bound vesicular monoamine transporter 2
(VMAT2) is critical for transporting dopamine into synap-
tic vesicles. On the other hand, the membrane-spanning
dopamine transporter (DAT) controls dopamine reuptake
from the synaptic cleft. TH+ iDALs were stained positive
for all these three markers, although the membrane-associ-
ated markers (VMAT2 and DAT) showed weaker staining in
the soma (Figure 5A). The neurotransmitter GABA was also
detectable in iDALs, which is nonetheless consistent with a
previous report showing that GABA is a co-transmitter in
endogenous SNc DA neurons (Tritsch et al., 2012). In sharp
contrast, iDALs did not express markers for other neuronal
subtypes such as CHAT and VGLUT1.
DAT staining in the cytosol of iDAL soma is weaker,
which may reflect lower expression and membrane-bound
localization. Its expression was then further confirmed in
the Dat-Cre;Rosa-tdT reporter mice (Figure 5B), in which
IRES-Cre was knocked into the endogenous Dat locus
without disrupting its expression (Backman et al., 2006).
TH+ DA neurons in the SNc were well labeled by the re-
porter tdT with strong soma expression (Figure 5B). Their
axonal projections in the striatum were also tdT+. However,
consistent with our TH-staining result, tdT+ somas were
not observed in the core striatal regions under normal

 conditions (Figure 5B). These reporter mice were then in-
jected with a control virus or iDAL factor-expressing virus
(Figure 5C). When examined at 10 wpi, TH+ and tdT+
somas were detected in iDALs only in striatal regions in-
jected with the iDAL factor-expressing virus but not a con-
trol virus (Figure 5C).
iDALs Possess Electrophysiological Properties Similar
to DA Neurons
Through whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we systemati-
cally analyzed the electrophysiological properties of iDALs
in comparisons with endogenous neurons in the adult

 neurons in the SNc, ventral tegmental area (VTA), and hy-
pothalamus (HTH) were specifically identified by the re-
porter tdT expression. MSNs, the predominant neuronal
subtype in the adult striatum, were tdT� and used as con-
trols. Some of the patch-clamp recorded cells were also
infused with biocytin during recordings for subsequent
verification by immunohistochemistry (Figure S7).
All the recorded cells showed inward sodium currents
and outward potassium currents under depolarizing volt-
ages (Figure 6A). Trains of action potentials (APs) were
observed upon step injections of depolarizing currents
indicating neuronal maturation (Figure 6B). iDALs had a
range of capacitance similar to DA neurons in the HTH
but significantly different from neurons in the other brain
regions (Figure 6C; n = 8–23 neurons per group; **p < 0.01;
***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001). The input resistance of iDALs
was in general similar to that of endogenous DA neurons
but not MSNs (Figure 6D; n = 8–23 neurons per group;
***p < 0.001). Furthermore, iDALs had similar resting mem-
brane potentials to endogenous DA neurons, which were
significantly different from those MSNs (Figure 6E; n = 8–
23 neurons per group; ****p < 0.0001). Detailed analysis
of AP spikes also revealed differences among these recorded
cells. Especially, the AP threshold, AP amplitude, and
maximum velocity of spike rise and decay for iDALs were
significantly different from those of endogenous MSNs
(Figures 6F–6J; n = 8–23 neurons per group; *p < 0.05;
***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001). iDALs had an AP half-width
similar to SNc DA neurons and MSNs but quite different
from those DA neurons in the VTA and HTH (Figure 6H;
n = 8–23 neurons per group; ****p < 0.0001). Overall, iDALs
exhibited similar intrinsic properties to DA neurons in
different regions of the adult brain.
iDALs Exhibit Firing Patterns Stereotypical to DA
Neurons
Dramatically different from striatal MSNs, iDALs fired
spontaneous APs, very similar to endogenous DA neu-
rons (Figure 7A). The spontaneous firing frequencies of
iDALs were within the range of resident DA neurons (Fig-
ure 7B; n = 8–23 neurons per group; **p < 0.01; ****p <
0.0001). The interspike interval coefficient variation,
which is an indicator of spike interval variability, was
also similar between iDALs and endogenous DA neurons
(Figure 7C; n = 8–23 neurons per group; ****p < 0.0001).
Hyperpolarization-activated
cyclic
nucleotide-gated
channels are a major source for spontaneous AP firings
(Chu and Zhen, 2010; Zolles et al., 2006). It can be assessed
by hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih), which is
a direct measurement of current in voltage-clamp mode
with prolonged hyperpolarization (Figure 7D), or by the
sag voltage in current-clamp mode (Figure 7E). MSNs
lacked significant Ih although they had sag voltage (Figures
7F and 7G; n = 8–23 neurons per group; **p < 0.01; ****p <
0.0001). On the other hand, iDALs showed both Ih and sag
voltage, resembling endogenous DA neurons in the SNc
and VTA. Interestingly, DA neurons in the HTH lacks
both Ih and sag voltage, suggesting that other channel ac-
tivity may be responsible for their spontaneous firings.
iDALs Form Functional Connections with Other
Neurons
Spontaneous synaptic currents were recorded to determine
the network connectivity of iDALs. The frequency and
amplitude of spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs)
were comparable for iDALs and the other resident neurons
including DA neurons and MSNs (Figures 7H–7J; n = 8–23
neurons per group). The sPSCs can be further separated
into slow and fast events. The slow events have a rise-
time over 2 ms, whereas the fast events have a rise-time
equal to or less than 2 ms. These two events represent a
crude separation of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to
the recorded neurons, because excitatory synaptic inputs
through the AMPA and NMDA receptors have a longer
rise-time than those inhibitory inputs from the GABA re-
ceptors (Kumar et al., 2002; Soltesz and Mody, 1994). Inter-
estingly, iDALs had a more similar proportion of slow and
fast synaptic inputs to those resident DA neurons than
MSNs (Figures 7K and 7L; n = 8–23 neurons per group;
*p < 0.05). Together, these results indicate that iDALs are
functionally mature and possess electrophysiological prop-
erties resembling endogenous DA neurons but not MSNs.
DISCUSSION
Expanding the repertoire of cells that can be phenotypi-
cally reprogrammed in vivo, the results of this study show
that striatal neurons in the adult mouse brain can be con-
verted to a phenotype resembling DA neurons. Properties
of these iDALs are validated by genetic lineage tracing,
marker expression, and, most importantly, extensive elec-
trophysiological characterizations. Such results provide
new perspectives on neuronal plasticity and cell identity
maintenance.
DA neuron-like cells have been previously reprog-
rammed from cultured fibroblasts (Caiazzo et al., 2011).
Nevertheless, the same combination of transcription fac-
tors (ASCL1, LMX1A, and NURR1) completely failed to
convert striatal glia into DA neurons in the adult mouse
brain (Pereira et al., 2017; Torper et al., 2015). Such results
suggest that cell origin and/or microenvironment may play
a major role in reprogramming. A recent study reported the
generation of TH+ neurons from resident glia by using a
different combination of factors after 6-hydroxydopamine
(6-OHDA)-induced brain lesions (Rivetti di Val Cervo et al.,
Stem Cell Reports j Vol. 11 j 1156–1170 j November 13, 2018
1163
 2017). However, the glial origin for those induced TH+ cells
was uncertain since no well-established genetic reporter
was employed, and the 6-OHDA lesion itself could induce
the appearance of TH+ cells in the striatum (Pereira et al.,
2017). Consistent with previous reports showing that
TH+ cells were not detected in the adult mouse striatum
after various virus injections (Pereira et al., 2017; Torper
et al., 2015), these cells were also rarely observed in our
mice injected with control virus or treated with VPA. In
this study, we initially aimed to identify conditions that
could reprogram resident glia into DA neurons. After series
of in vivo screens and systematic lineage mappings with

that neurons but not glia are the cell origin for our iDALs.
Further studies are clearly needed to identify conditions
that can reprogram resident glia into DA neurons.
Although iDALs could be induced by a combination of
three DA neuron-restricted transcription factors (NURR1,
FOXA2, and LMX1A), their number could be enhanced
by the inclusion of SOX2 and VPA. VPA is a commonly
used anti-convulsant and a histone deacetylase inhibitor
with the ability to facilitate reprogramming of somatic
cells to pluripotency (Huangfu et al., 2008). It can also
promote neurogenesis through induction of Neurod1
(Hsieh et al., 2004) and activation of the ERK signaling
pathway (Hao et al., 2004). In this regard, ectopic Neurod1
alone is sufficient to reprogram reactive glial cells to neu-
rons (Guo et al., 2014), although VPA itself fails to induce
any new neurons in non-neurogenic regions of the adult
brain (Niu et al., 2013, 2015). Furthermore, VPA-induced
BDNF expression may account for its ability to promote
maturation and long-term survival of reprogrammed neu-
rons in the adult mouse brain and spinal cord (Niu et al.,
2013, 2015; Su et al., 2014). These multiple functions of
VPA may be important for its role in the generation of
iDALs.
It is currently unclear how a stem cell factor, SOX2, pro-
motes phenotypic reprogramming of adult neurons in vivo.
It has been previously shown that SOX2 exhibits intrinsic
properties of a pioneering transcription factor that can
target silent sites of nucleosomes to initiate cellular reprog-
ramming (Soufi et al., 2015). Its binding to intractable
genomic loci can be further enhanced by the ubiquitously
expressed PARP1 in an enzymatic activity-independent
manner (Liu and Kraus, 2017). Such pioneer activity of
SOX2 may open up chromatin structure that is needed
for further reprogramming by other fate-determining tran-
scription factors, such as ASCL1 in pericytes (Karow et al.,
2012) and DA neuron-restricted factors in neurons (this
study). Because of its high expression in glial cells, ectopic
SOX2 may also have non-cell-autonomous effects that
create a microenvironment facilitating phenotypic reprog-
ramming of striatal neurons by other DA factors.
Postmitotic cortical neurons can be reprogrammed into a
different subtype by a single transcription factor, FEZF2 (De
la Rossa et al., 2013; Rouaux and Arlotta, 2013). However,
this subtype reprogramming is restricted to embryonic
and very early postnatal stage indicating a critical period
of nuclear plasticity (Rouaux and Arlotta, 2013). In
contrast, our results show that the reprogrammable period
can be extended into the adult stage if an appropriate com-
bination of factors is employed. Our extensive analysis re-
veals that iDALs exhibit electrophysiological properties of
endogenous DA neurons, such as resting membrane poten-
tial, firing threshold and amplitude for action potentials,
spontaneous AP firings, and the hyperpolarization-acti-
vated current (Ih). Nonetheless, immunohistochemistry re-
veals that some MSN-restricted markers, such as CTIP2 and
DARPP32, can still be detected in these iDALs, despite the
lack of MSN-like electrophysiology. Such a result suggests
that a complete suppression of gene expression programs
in the original cells may need additional factors, although
their residual expression is apparently not sufficient to
block the DA neuron-like properties of iDALs.
In conclusion, our results unexpectedly reveal that
adult
neurons
can
be
phenotypically
reprogrammed
in vivo, providing additional insights into our knowledge
on neuronal plasticity and cell identity maintenance.
Such knowledge may one day be applied to devise thera-
peutic strategies for treating neurological diseases through
reprogramming the phenotype of local neurons.

 et al., 2010), Dat-Cre (Backman et al., 2006), and Rosa-tdTomato
(Ai14) (Madisen et al., 2010). Wild-type C57/BL6J mice were ob-
tained from the Jackson Laboratories. All mice were housed under
a 12-hr light/dark cycle and had ad libitum access to food and wa-
ter in the UT Southwestern animal facility. No significant pheno-
typic differences were observed between male and female mice;
thus, both genders were included in the analysis. Mice of ages
6 weeks to 24 months were used. Experimental protocols were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
at UT Southwestern.
Virus Production and Stereotactic Brain Injections
The indicated human genes were subcloned into the CS-CDF-
CG-PRE lentiviral vector. SOX2 was under the hGFAP pro-
moter while the remaining factors were driven by the hPGK
promoter. As described previously (Niu et al., 2013, 2015), repli-
cation-deficient lentivirus was produced in HEK293T cells after
transient transfections. Virus was collected and concentrated
by ultracentrifugation (25,000 rpm for 2 hr at 4�C) or poly-
ethylene glycol precipitation. Striata of adult mice were stereo-
tactically injected with a final volume of 2 mL virus each
with an original titer of 0.5–2 3 109 colony-forming units
per mL. Viruses were mixed in equal volume for co-injection
experiments. Injection coordinates are as follows: anterior/
posterior, +1.0 mm; medial/lateral, ±2 mm; and dorsal/ventral
from skull, �3.0 mm.
Tamoxifen, BrdU, and VPA Administration
Tamoxifen (T5648, Sigma) was dissolved in corn oil at a concen-
tration of 20 mg/mL and injected intraperitoneally at a daily
dose of 4 mg/40 g body weight for the indicated duration. Prolif-
erative cells were labeled by BrdU (B5002, Sigma) through intra-
peritoneal injections (100 mg/kg body weight, twice daily) or
drinking water containing BrdU (1g/L) as indicated. VPA (P4543;
Sigma) in drinking water (4 g/L) was administered for the indi-
cated durations.
Immunohistochemistry and Quantification
Immunohistochemical analysis of 40-mm brain sections were con-
ducted essentially as described previously (Niu et al., 2013, 2015).
The following primary antibodies were used: BrdU (rat BU1/75,
1:500, Accurate Chemical), NeuN (MAB377, mouse, 1:500, Milli-
pore), SOX2 (AB5603, rabbit, 1:500, Millipore), DCX (SC-8066,
goat, 1:150, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), TH (chick, 1:1,000,
Aves), DARPP32 (no. 2302, rabbit, 1:500, Cell Signaling Technol-
ogy), CTIP2 (AB18465, rat, 1:500, Abcam), DAT (MAB369, rat,
1:200, Millipore), DDC (Ab3905, rabbit, 1:500, Abcam), VMAT2
(NBP1-69750, rabbit, 1:250, Novus), VGLUT1 (135311, mouse,
1:1,000, Synaptic), CHAT (AB144P, goat, 1:200, Chemicon), and
GABA (A2052, rabbit, 1:500, Sigma). Alexa Fluor 488-, 594-, or
647-conjugated corresponding secondary antibodies from Jack-
son ImmunoResearch were used for indirect fluorescence. Images
were taken using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. A Cell
Counter software plugin in the ImageJ program was used to count
cells. Data were obtained from one-sixth of the sections spanning
the whole striatal region in each mouse. A representative image
was shown from at least four similar ones. Confocal images
were Z series projections unless otherwise indicated in the figure
legends.
Electrophysiology
Procedures were as described previously (Niu et al., 2013, 2015). In
brief, acute midbrain slices were prepared for endogenous DA neu-
rons and acute striatal slices were prepared for iDALs and MSNs.
Dat-Cre;Rosa-tdT tracing line was used to trace DA neurons. For
acute striatal slices, adult mice were deeply anesthetized and trans-
cardially perfused with chilled striatal dissection buffer: 79 mM
NaCl, 23 mM NaHCO3, 68 mM sucrose, 12 mM D-glucose,
2.3 mM KCl, 1.1 mM NaH2PO4, 6 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2,
and 1% kynurenate acid at pH 7.4, 300 mOsm, and aerated with
95%O2/5%CO2. The striatum with overlying neocortex was then
dissected out. Acute sagittal slices (250 mm thickness) were
collected between +2 and �2 mm from the bregma on a Leica
VT1200S slicer. They were then incubated in aerated artificial cere-
brospinal fluid (ACSF) containing 119 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl,
26 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 11 mM D-glucose, 1 mM
MgCl2, and 2 mM CaCl2 at pH 7.4, 300 mOsm, and aerated with
95%O2/5%CO2 to recover for 30 min at 35�C followed by addi-
tional incubation for over 1 hr at room temperature. For acute
midbrain slices, the midbrain with attaching brain stem and cortex
were dissected after anesthesia in chilled midbrain dissection
buffer: 3 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 21 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM
D-glucose, 215 mM sucrose, 2 mM MgCl2, 1.6 mM CaCl2 at
pH 7.4, 300 mOsm, and aerated with 95%O2/5%CO2. Midbrain sli-
ces (150 mm thickness) were then collected on a Leica VT1200S
slicer. They were recovered in aerated ACSF at room temperature
for at least 1 hr. In both cases, a single slice was then transferred
to a submersion chamber and perfused at 3 mL/min with ACSF
at 30�C for striatal slices and room temperature for midbrain slices.
Lineage-traced cells in the striatum were identified under visual
guidance using IR-DIC optics and tdT fluorescence. Whole-cell cur-
rent-clamp and voltage-camp recordings were performed using
glass pipettes (4–7 MU) filled with intracellular solution: 0.2 mM
EGTA, 130 mM K-gluconate, 6 mM KCl, 3 mM NaCl, 10 mM
HEPES, 4 mM ATP-Mg, 0.4 mM GTP-Na, and 14 mM phosphocre-
atine-Tris at pH 7.2 and 285 mOsm supplemented with 0.5% Bio-
cytin (B4261; Sigma). Biocytin-infused cells were detected with
Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated avidin. All recordings were obtained
with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier. Currents were filtered at
2 kHz, and acquired and digitized at 10 kHz using Clampex 10.3
(Molecular Devices). Both spontaneous and elicited APs were re-
corded in current-clamp mode; elicited AP was recorded by a series
of current injections starting from �160 pA with 20, 40, 80, or
160 pA increments and 800 ms duration. Sag voltage was recorded
in current-clamp mode with hyperpolarizing voltage steps from
�60 mV with 10-mV intervals. Ih was recorded in voltage-clamp
mode by injecting current to �130 mV and 6 s duration, and an
average of 10 traces. Sodium and potassium currents were recorded
in voltage-clamp mode in response to a series of voltage steps
ranging from �60 to +60 mM at 10 mV increments and 100 ms
duration. SPSCs were recorded in voltage-clamp mode. In all
voltage-clamp recordings, cells were clamped at �60 or �80 mV,
whichever was close to the resting membrane potential of the
cell except during the voltage-step protocol. In all current-clamp

 recordings, recordings were made at the resting membrane poten-
tial or without any current injection except otherwise stated. Series
and input resistance were measured in voltage-clamp mode with a
400-ms, 10-mV step from a �60-mV holding potential (filtered by
10 kHz, sampled at 50 kHz). Cells were accepted only if the series
resistance was less than 30 MU and stable throughout the
experiment.
Data analysis was performed with Clampfit10.3 software (Molec-
ular Devices). The AP trace immediately above threshold was used
to determine the delay of the first spike as the length of time from
the start of current steps to the peak of AP. The same AP trace was
used to measure AP threshold as the corresponding voltage when
there was the sharpest change of trace slope. The above-indicated
AP trace was also measured to determine AP amplitude, half-width,
and maximum velocity of rise and decay using the ‘‘Statistics’’
function from the ‘‘Analyze’’ menu as peak amplitude, half-width,
and maximum rise and decay slope. AP frequency was obtained by
dividing the maximum number of spikes during the current steps
protocol with the step time duration (800 ms). Similarly, sodium
and potassium currents were measured using the Statistics func-
tion. The biggest current was used. SPSCs were analyzed by using
the Mini Analysis Program v6.0.7 (Synaptosoft). Traces were im-
ported into the program, and baseline noise was measured by
‘‘measuring RMS noise’’ option in ‘‘Noise Analysis’’ menu. Four
times the noise was used as the threshold for detection. Each indi-
vidual event was carefully examined to avoid false positives. Statis-
tics can be shown from the ‘‘Events’’ menus.
Statistical Analysis
All experiments were performed by using at least three mice
per condition unless otherwise indicated. Statics was done in
GraphPad Prism. D’Agostino-Pearson omnibus normality test
was first done on the data to determine whether it is a normal dis-
tribution. If the data passed the normality test, then one-way
ANOVA was used to determine significance. If the data did not
pass the normality test, then Krushal-Wallis test was used to deter-
mine significance. Significant differences are indicated by *p <
0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, or ****p < 0.0001.
