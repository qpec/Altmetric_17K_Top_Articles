Abstract
BACKGROUND—Data reported during the past 5 years indicate that rates of survival have 
increased among infants born at the borderline of viability, but less is known about how increased 
rates of survival among these infants relate to early childhood neurodevelopmental outcomes.
METHODS—We compared survival and neurodevelopmental outcomes among infants born at 22 
to 24 weeks of gestation, as assessed at 18 to 22 months of corrected age, across three consecutive 
birth-year epochs (2000–2003 [epoch 1], 2004–2007 [epoch 2], and 2008–2011 [epoch 3]). The 
infants were born at 11 centers that participated in the National Institute of Child Health and 
Human Development Neonatal Research Network. The primary outcome measure was a three-
level outcome — survival without neurodevelopmental impairment, survival with 
neurodevelopmental impairment, or death. After accounting for differences in infant 
characteristics, including birth center, we used multinomial generalized logit models to compare

 the relative risk of survival without neurodevelopmental impairment, survival with 
neurodevelopmental impairment, and death.
RESULTS—Data on the primary outcome were available for 4274 of 4458 infants (96%) born at 
the 11 centers. The percentage of infants who survived increased from 30% (424 of 1391 infants) 
in epoch 1 to 36% (487 of 1348 infants) in epoch 3 (P<0.001). The percentage of infants who 
survived without neurodevelopmental impairment increased from 16% (217 of 1391) in epoch 1 to 
20% (276 of 1348) in epoch 3 (P = 0.001), whereas the percentage of infants who survived with 
neurodevelopmental impairment did not change significantly (15% [207 of 1391] in epoch 1 and 
16% [211 of 1348] in epoch 3, P = 0.29). After adjustment for changes in the baseline 
characteristics of the infants over time, both the rate of survival with neurodevelopmental 
impairment (as compared with death) and the rate of survival without neurodevelopmental 
impairment (as compared with death) increased over time (adjusted relative risks, 1.27 [95% 
confidence interval {CI}, 1.01 to 1.59] and 1.59 [95% CI, 1.28 to 1.99], respectively).
CONCLUSIONS—The rate of survival without neurodevelopmental impairment increased 
between 2000 and 2011 in this large cohort of periviable infants. (Funded by the National 
Institutes of Health and others; ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT00063063 and NCT00009633.)
Care of periviable infants remains a great challenge in neonatal and perinatal medicine.1 
Infants born between 22 and 24 weeks of gestation often die or survive with long-term 
neurodevelopmental impairment.2–4 The approach to resuscitation and management at these 
early gestational ages varies substantially.1,5
Data reported during the past 5 years indicate that mortality has declined among extremely 
premature infants.6–9 Investigators at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child 
Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network (NRN) reported a 
decrease in mortality over the past two decades, with the greatest gains in survival seen 
among infants born at 23 and 24 weeks of gestation after 2008.8,9 Such studies raise 
questions about neurodevelopmental outcomes in surviving infants. NRN studies over 
previous periods have not shown significant improvement in neurodevelopmental outcomes 
over time among periviable infants,2,3 and there is concern that declining mortality in this 
population may lead to a greater number of infants surviving with neurodevelopmental 
impairment.10,11 The availability of data on both mortality and neurodevelopmental 
outcomes among survivors is important for families and clinicians making early care 
decisions for these high-risk infants.1
The objective of our study was to evaluate changes over time in survival and 
neurodevelopmental outcomes among infants born at 22 to 24 weeks of gestation, as 
assessed at 18 to 22 months of corrected age (with corrected age defined as the age the 
infant would be if born at term). We hypothesized that in addition to the rate of survival, the 
rate of survival without neurodevelopmental impairment also increased from 2000 through 
2011.

 METHODS
STUDY POPULATION AND DATA COLLECTION
We included infants born at 22 weeks 0 days to 24 weeks 6 days of gestation between 
January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2011, who were enrolled in the generic database registry 
of the NICHD NRN. Data from the 11 academic tertiary care centers that participated in the 
NRN for the entire duration of the study period were included in the analysis. A total of 427 
infants who were not born at the centers were excluded. Data for mother–infant dyads were 
collected prospectively by trained research personnel for all live births, which included 
infants who died in the delivery room. Gestational age was defined as completed weeks of 
gestation, as determined according to the best obstetrical estimate that was based on the last 
menstrual period, obstetrical factors, or prenatal ultrasonogram (or a combination thereof), 
or — when obstetrical dating was unavailable — according to neonatal assessment that 
included the Ballard or Dubowitz examination.12,13 To assess whether there were changes in 
resuscitation practices over time, we evaluated the proportion of infants who did not receive 
active treatment after birth, which was defined by the use of surfactant, endotracheal 
intubation, ventilatory support (i.e., continuous positive airway pressure, bag-mask 
ventilation, or mechanical ventilation), chest compressions, epinephrine, or parenteral 
nutrition.5 Small for gestational age was defined as birth weight below the 10th percentile on 
Olsen growth curves.14 Severe intraventricular hemorrhage was defined as grade III to IV, 
according to the criteria of Papile et al.15 The presence of sepsis was determined by a 
positive blood culture and was classified as early onset (≤72 hours) or late onset (>72 hours). 
Retinopathy of prematurity was considered to be severe if the infant received surgical 
treatment, intravitreal bevacizumab, or both. Necrotizing enterocolitis was defined as Bell’s 
stage II to III, according to the modified Bell’s classification (with scores ranging from I to 
III and higher scores indicating greater severity of disease).16 Infants were considered to 
have bronchopulmonary dysplasia if they were receiving supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks 
of postmenstrual age (the infant’s gestational age at birth plus the time elapsed since birth 
[chronological age]).
STUDY OVERSIGHT
The institutional review boards at each of the 11 centers approved the protocol, available 
with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Nine centers required written informed consent 
for the follow-up protocol (2 centers granted a waiver), and 1 center required oral informed 
consent for the in-hospital protocol (10 centers granted a waiver). The third author, a 
statistician at the data coordinating center, had full access to the data and performed the 
analysis. All the authors vouch for the integrity, accuracy, and completeness of the data and 
analyses and for the fidelity of the study to the protocol.
OUTCOME MEASURES
The primary outcome measure was a three-level outcome — survival without 
neurodevelopmental impairment, survival with neurodevelopmental impairment, or death, as 
assessed at 18 to 22 months of corrected age. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were assessed 
at 18 to 22 months of corrected age with the use of neurologic examinations and the Bayley 
Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, second edition (Bayley-II), for infants born

 between 2000 and 2005, and third edition (Bayley-III), for infants born between 2006 and 
2011. Differences between the two editions are summarized in Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org. Infants were considered to have 
neurodevelopmental impairment if they had at least one of the following conditions: 
moderate or severe cerebral palsy, Gross Motor Function Classification System level of at 
least 2 (on a scale of 1 [mild impairment] to 5 [most severe impairment]), profound hearing 
loss requiring amplification in both ears, profound visual impairment with visual acuity of 
less than 20/200 in both eyes, or cognitive impairment, which was defined as a Mental 
Developmental Index score of less than 70 (two standard deviations below the mean ±SD 
score of 100±15 [scores range from 50 to 150, with the lower scores indicating a greater 
degree of developmental delay]) (Bayley-II) or a Cognitive Composite score of less than 85 
(one standard deviation below the mean ±SD score of 100±15 [scores range from 55 to 145, 
with the lower scores indicating a greater degree of developmental delay]) (Bayley-III). We 
selected these cutoff points to adjust for the difference between Bayley-II and Bayley-III in 
estimating cognitive performance,17–20 on the basis of data showing 97% agreement 
between a Bayley-II Mental Developmental Index score lower than 70 and a Bayley-III 
Cognitive Composite score lower than 85.21 Bayley-II and Bayley-III motor scores and 
Bayley-III language scores were not included in the definition for neurodevelopmental 
impairment.
Given the potential discrepancy between Bayley-II and Bayley-III assessments, we chose 
neurosensory impairment as a secondary outcome to compare neurologic outcomes over 
time independent of Bayley scores. Neurosensory impairment was defined as moderate or 
severe cerebral palsy, Gross Motor Function Classification System level of at least 2, 
profound hearing loss, or profound visual impairment.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We compared outcomes among infants in three birth-year epochs (2000–2003 [epoch 1], 
2004–2007 [epoch 2], and 2008–2011 [epoch 3]). The study period and epoch definitions 
were chosen to be consistent with the definitions in a recent NRN report on changes in 
mortality over time8 and for consistency with previous NRN studies of neurodevelopmental 
outcomes in periviable infants over consecutive epochs.2,3 Demographics, perinatal 
characteristics, medical conditions, therapies, and outcomes were compared across epochs 
with the use of chi-square tests for categorical variables and median tests for continuous 
variables. Outcomes were stratified according to epoch for each of the participating centers. 
Multilevel generalized logit modeling was conducted to determine the effect of epoch on the 
three-level categorical outcome, with adjustment for gestational age, multiple gestation, 
maternal race, sex of the infant, and small-for-gestational-age status; birth center was 
included as a random effect. These covariates were selected to adjust for baseline factors that 
may influence outcomes.22,23 Variables related to care practices that may have changed over 
time, such as the use of antenatal glucocorticoids, were left out of the analysis so that the 
temporal effect would not be obscured. A similar modeling approach was used for the 
outcome of neurosensory impairment. Prespecified subgroup analyses were performed 
according to the gestational week in which the infants were born. Because changes in

 outcomes over time could reflect changes in resuscitation practices, we repeated the adjusted 
analyses with the sample limited to infants who received active treatment.
To further address the change from Bayley-II to Bayley-III, we performed a sensitivity 
analysis to evaluate changes in outcomes over the years since the implementation of Bayley-
III. The analysis was restricted to infants born between 2006 and 2011. We used birth year, 
specified as a continuous variable, in place of epoch as the time variable in the model and 
adjusted for the same variables as in the regression model of the primary outcome.
All analyses were performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute). 
Two-sided P values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. The 
primary outcome analysis was considered to be confirmatory, and all other reported analyses 
were deemed exploratory and hypothesis generating, with P values presented for descriptive 
purposes. Thus, no adjustments were made for multiple testing.
RESULTS
INFANT AND MATERNAL CHARACTERISTICS
A total of 4458 infants were born at 11 participating centers during the study period. The 
analysis cohort included 4274 infants (96%) for whom data on the primary outcome were 
available. The cohort comprised 749 infants (18%) born at 22 weeks, 1435 infants (34%) 
born at 23 weeks, and 2090 infants (49%) born at 24 weeks. Birth weight, gestational age, 
and infant sex distributions did not differ significantly across epochs, although the 
proportion of infants who were small for their gestational age increased significantly over 
time (Table 1). The median maternal age increased over time, and the proportion of mothers 
with an education level less than high school decreased. The rates of multiple births, 
cesarean sections, and antenatal glucocorticoid use increased between epoch 1 and epoch 3, 
although the rate of antenatal antibiotic use decreased. Rates of active treatment did not 
change significantly across epochs. Active treatment was received by 22% of the infants 
(167 of 749) born at 22 weeks, by 71% (1015 of 1435) born at 23 weeks, and by 95% (1994 
of 2090) born at 24 weeks.
The incidence of posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus with shunt placement, late-onset sepsis, 
and bronchopulmonary dysplasia decreased between epoch 1 and epoch 3 (Table 1). The rate 
of postnatal glucocorticoid use also decreased between epoch 1 and epoch 3, although the 
rate of high-frequency ventilation increased. The percentages of infants with severe 
intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, early-onset sepsis, necrotizing 
enterocolitis, and ligation of a patent ductus arteriosus did not differ significantly across 
epochs. The incidence of severe retinopathy of prematurity was highest in epoch 2.
OUTCOMES
The percentage of infants who survived without neurodevelopmental impairment increased 
from 16% (217 of 1391) in epoch 1 to 20% (276 of 1348) in epoch 3 (P<0.001) (Table 2). 
The rate of death was lowest in epoch 3 (64% [861 of 1348 infants died]). The proportions 
of infants who survived with neurodevelopmental impairment did not differ significantly 
across epochs. Among infants born at 22 weeks, there was no significant change in

 outcomes (survival without neurodevelopmental impairment, survival with 
neurodevelopmental impairment, and death) over time. Among infants born at 23 and 24 
weeks, the rate of survival without neurodevelopmental impairment increased between 
epoch 1 and epoch 3, although the rate of survival with neurodevelopmental impairment did 
not differ significantly.
Among surviving infants, we found no significant difference in the incidence of 
neurodevelopmental impairment or neurosensory impairment across epochs (Table 3). The 
incidence of profound visual impairment declined significantly to 2 of 484 infants (<1%) in 
epoch 3, but the rates of other individual components of neurodevelopmental impairment 
were similar over time. Survival and neurodevelopmental outcomes varied across centers 
(Fig. 1).
Of the 4274 infants with data on the primary outcome, 4227 infants had complete data on all 
of the variables included in the generalized logit regression model (46 infants were excluded 
because of missing data on race and 1 infant was excluded because of missing data on small-
for-gestational-age status). After adjusting for baseline characteristics, we found that both 
the rate of survival with neurodevelopmental impairment versus death and the rate of 
survival without neurodevelopmental impairment versus death increased between epoch 1 
and epoch 3 and between epoch 2 and epoch 3 (Table 4). The increase in the rate of survival 
without neurodevelopmental impairment was not significantly greater than that of survival 
with neurodevelopmental impairment. Our findings were similar when we limited the 
analysis to infants who received active treatment.
After we excluded the Bayley score from our outcomes, we found that both the rate of 
survival with neurosensory impairment versus death and the rate of survival without 
neurosensory impairment versus death increased over time, but the increase in survival rate 
with neurosensory impairment did not differ significantly from the increase in survival rate 
without neurosensory impairment (Table 4).
Among the infants born at 23 weeks, both the rate of survival without neurodevelopmental 
impairment versus death and the rate of survival without neurodevelopmental impairment 
versus survival with neurodevelopmental impairment increased between epoch 1 and epoch 
3 (Table 4). Among the infants born at 24 weeks, both the rate of survival with 
neurodevelopmental impairment versus death and the rate of survival without 
neurodevelopmental impairment versus death increased over time, but the rates of increase 
did not differ significantly. There was no significant change in outcomes among the infants 
born at 22 weeks. However, the 95% confidence intervals for these estimates were wide, 
which reflects the small sample size in this gestational age group.
In the sensitivity analyses to evaluate changes in outcomes among the infants eligible for the 
Bayley-III examination (i.e., infants who were born between 2006 and 2011), in which birth 
year was used in place of epoch in the regression model, we found that the rate of survival 
without neurodevelopmental impairment versus death increased from 2006 to 2011 (adjusted 
relative risk, 1.08 per 1-year increase; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04 to 1.13). The rate 
of survival with neurodevelopmental impairment versus death also increased (adjusted

 relative risk, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.13). The rate of survival without neurodevelopmental 
impairment versus survival with neurodevelopmental impairment did not change 
significantly over time (adjusted relative risk, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.05).
DISCUSSION
Our study showed an increase in the rate of survival without neurodevelopmental 
impairment from 2000 through 2011 in a large cohort of periviable infants born at a 
consortium of U.S. academic tertiary care centers. A significant decline in mortality over the 
study period was accompanied by relative increases in both the rate of survival with 
neurodevelopmental impairment and the rate of survival without neurodevelopmental 
impairment. The increase in the rate of survival was not associated with a disproportionate 
increase in the rate of survival with neurodevelopmental impairment; rather, the rate of 
survival without neurodevelopmental impairment and the rate of survival with 
neurodevelopmental impairment increased similarly (adjusted relative risk, 1.27; 95% CI, 
0.99 to 1.65). These findings are important for guiding counseling and decision making with 
respect to periviable birth. Prognosis continues to be guarded; in the most recent epoch, 
mortality was 64%, and 43% of surviving infants had neurodevelopmental impairment.
The improvements in survival and neurodevelopmental outcomes that we observed may 
reflect advances in obstetrical and neonatal care. We observed declines in the rates of 
postnatal glucocorticoid use, late-onset sepsis, posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus with shunt 
placement, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia over time, each of which has been 
independently associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.24–27 Proactive 
perinatal management has been associated with better outcomes among extremely premature 
infants, including an increased rate of survival and unchanged or reduced rates of disability 
among survivors.5,20,28–30 In our study, the rates of cesarean delivery and antenatal 
glucocorticoid use increased over time. The improvement in outcomes was unlikely to be 
due to changes in the use of active treatment for infants, because the rates of active treatment 
were similar across epochs and the study findings did not change significantly when we 
restricted the analysis to infants who received active treatment. Changes in maternal 
characteristics may have contributed to the improvement in outcomes, because maternal age 
and level of education increased over time.
Previous studies of survival and neurodevelopmental outcomes among extremely premature 
infants have shown mixed results, with reports of increased,10,11 unchanged,2,3,31 or 
decreased rates of neurodevelopmental impairment over time.32,33 Many of these studies 
involved primarily more mature infants, and it is unclear whether the results can be 
extrapolated to the periviable population. Comparing neurodevelopmental outcomes across 
studies in this population would be complicated by sparse data and differences in sample 
selection, criteria used to define impairment, and age at follow-up. Studies from the United 
Kingdom, Sweden, and Japan, published in 2012 and 2013, showed rates of 
neurodevelopmental impairment of 34% (46 of 136 infants), 41% (56 of 138), and 47% (130 
of 279), respectively, among surviving infants born at 22 to 24 weeks, as evaluated at 2.5 to 
3 years of corrected age, as compared with a rate of 46% (627 of 1370) in our study.20,31,34 
Among infants born at 24 weeks, rates of neurodevelopmental impairment were higher in

 our study (44%) than in these three studies (30 to 37%). It is unclear how much of this 
variation is due to differences in sample ascertainment, study design, infant characteristics, 
or care practices. We found variation in outcomes by center; this observation is consistent 
with the findings from other studies published in 2015 and 2004 that assessed extremely 
premature infants.5,22
In the subgroup analysis performed according to the gestational week in which the infants 
were born, we found that the rate of survival without neurodevelopmental impairment 
increased over time among infants born at 23 weeks and 24 weeks. However, only 1% of 
infants born at 22 weeks survived without neurodevelopmental impairment in each epoch. 
Among the 167 infants born at 22 weeks who received active treatment after birth, 9 (5%) 
survived without neurodevelopmental impairment.
The best measures of neurodevelopmental outcomes in premature infants continue to be 
debated. Our definition of neurodevelopmental impairment included measures of motor 
function, sensory impairment, and cognitive delay, which is consistent with the definition 
used in other studies. Clinicians and families should note that there is likely to be substantial 
variation in the long-term functioning of children classified as having neurodevelopmental 
impairment in early childhood. Although early neurodevelopmental assessment is important 
for the timely identification of children at risk for long-term neurologic impairment or 
developmental delay, its capacity to predict later functioning is limited.35–37 Many children 
will catch up to their peers by school age, whereas other children will have persistent 
impairment. Conversely, some children without signs of neurodevelopmental impairment in 
early childhood will have impairments that manifest at school age.37,38 Bayley-II Mental 
Developmental Index and Bayley-III Cognitive Composite scores have been shown to 
correlate with later cognitive outcomes but account for only a minority of the variance in 
later cognitive functioning.35,36,39 Reported rates of impairment at school age among 
children who were born extremely premature are generally lower than those reported in early 
childhood, but studies have been limited by small sample sizes and heterogeneous 
results.35,37,40 Additional research is needed to better understand long-term outcomes 
among periviable infants.
Our analysis was complicated by the transition from Bayley-II to Bayley-III during the study 
period. Studies involving extremely premature infants have shown that Bayley-III Cognitive 
Composite scores are, on average, 10 to 11 points higher than the Bayley-II Mental 
Developmental Index scores.17,18 To address this limitation, we defined cognitive 
impairment using a conservative Bayley-III Cognitive Composite score lower than 85, which 
is one standard deviation below the mean score of 100. Johnson et al.21 observed 97% 
agreement between a Bayley-II Mental Developmental Index score lower than 70 and a 
Bayley-III Cognitive Composite score lower than 85. Furthermore, we showed an increase in 
the rate of survival without neurosensory impairment over time, with neurosensory 
impairment defined by the same components as neurodevelopmental impairment with the 
exclusion of the Bayley scores. Finally, when we evaluated changes in outcomes in the years 
since the implementation of Bayley-III, the results were consistent.

 Our study has additional limitations. The data represent a select group of infants born in a 
subset of academic centers and may not be generalizable to other populations. Furthermore, 
we did not correct for multiple testing, which increases the probability that some of the 
significant differences that we observed in our secondary outcomes analyses may have 
occurred by chance. There is a small chance that the changes in outcomes over time reflect 
random variation alone.
In conclusion, our study showed a small but significant increase in the rate of survival 
without neurodevelopmental impairment at 18 to 22 months of corrected age among 
periviable infants. Despite improvements over time, the incidence of death, 
neurodevelopmental impairment, and other adverse outcomes remains high in this 
population.

 Figure 1. Mortality and Neurodevelopmental Outcomes at 18 to 22 Months of Corrected Age by 
Birth Epoch and Center
Shown are the rates of death, survival with neurodevelopmental impairment, and survival 
without neurodevelopmental impairment at the 11 centers that were included in the analysis. 
The rates were adjusted for gestational age at birth, multiple gestation, sex, race, and small-
for-gestational-age status. Because of rounding, percentages may not total 100.

*P values were determined using chi-square tests for categorical variables and median tests for continuous variables.
†Race was determined by investigators on the basis of chart abstraction using categories specified in the study manual of operation (black, white, 
Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, or more than one race).
‡Any receipt of antenatal glucocorticoids was defined as a full or partial course during the current pregnancy for the purpose of accelerating fetal 
maturity. A full course was defined as two doses of betamethasone (12 or 24 hours apart) or four doses of dexamethasone (≥6 hours apart).
§Receipt of antenatal antibiotics was defined as receipt of any antibiotic preceding birth during the hospital admission in which delivery occurred.
¶Active treatment was defined as the use of surfactant, endotracheal intubation, ventilatory support (i.e., continuous positive airway pressure, bag-
mask ventilation, or mechanical ventilation), chest compressions, epinephrine, or parenteral nutrition.
‖Data on medical conditions and therapies were available for infants surviving more than 12 hours and undergoing the applicable examination (e.g., 
sonogram for intraventricular hemorrhage).

*The number of children who underwent a Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development examination was 421 in epoch 1, 458 in epoch 2, and 
480 in epoch 3. The number of children who underwent a neurologic examination was 424 in epoch 1, 458 in epoch 2, and 487 in epoch 3.
†P values were determined using chi-square tests.
‡Cognitive impairment alone indicates infants with cognitive impairment but without moderate or severe cerebral palsy, profound visual 
impairment, or profound hearing impairment.

*Comparisons were adjusted for gestational age (defined as completed weeks of gestation), multiple gestation, sex, race, small-for-gestational-age 
status, and birth center (random effect). Gestational age was not included in 22-, 23-, and 24-week subgroup analyses.
†Data on survival and neurodevelopmental outcomes were available for 4227 infants (46 infants were excluded because of missing data on race, 
and 1 infant was excluded because of missing data on small-for-gestational-age status).
‡Data on survival and neurodevelopmental outcomes were available for 737 infants.
§Data on survival and neurodevelopmental outcomes were available for 1417 infants.
¶Data on survival and neurodevelopmental outcomes were available for 2073 infants.
