P
resbycusis, or age-related hearing loss (ARHL),
affects approximately two-thirds of adults older than
70 years and four-fifths of adults older than 85.1 It is
a major public health concern that is associated with
numerous deleterious effects. Although ARHL increases
social isolation because of impaired communication, it
decreases one’
s ability to perform activities of daily living
and instrumental activities of daily life without assistance
from others.2 Poor hearing is also associated with an
increased incidence of cognitive impairment and rate of
cognitive decrease.3,4 Finally, ARHL increases overall mor-
tality in older adults because of injuries from falls and
motor vehicle crashes and is notably associated with poor
self-rated health.5 Despite the high prevalence and negative
health consequences of ARHL, hearing aids are underused
in the older adult population regardless of being shown to
improve the social, functional, and emotional effects of
hearing loss.6-8
Currently, there is a global demographic change that has
resulted in an increase in the number of older adults. In the
UnitedStates,thepopulationofindividualsolderthan80years
is expected to double in the next 40 years.9 To better serve this
growingpopulation,itisimportanttoconsiderpersons60years
and older as a continuum of age rather than a single group. The
majority of research in ARHL, however, groups participants
older than 70 years into a single category, thus obscuring
changes in the severity of hearing loss as individuals live to 80
years or older. Here, we characterize the hearing loss of indi-
viduals between the ages of 80 and 106 as it relates to age, sex,
and hearing aid use.
IMPORTANCE There is a critical disparity in knowledge regarding the rate and nature of
hearing loss in the older old (80 years and older).
OBJECTIVE To determine if the rate of age-related hearing loss is constant in the older old.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We performed a retrospective review that began on
August 1, 2014, with audiometric evaluations at an academic medical center of 647 patients
aged between 80 and 106 years, of whom 141 had multiple audiograms.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES From a population perspective, the degree of hearing loss
was compared across the following age brackets: 80 to 84 years, 85 to 89 years, 90 to 94
years, and 95 years and older. From an individual perspective, the rate of hearing decrease
between 2 audiograms was compared with age.
RESULTS Changes in hearing among age brackets were higher during the 10th decade of life
than the 9th decade at all frequencies (5.4-11.9 dB hearing level [dB HL]) for the 647 patients
(mean [SD] age, 90 [5.5] years). Correspondingly, the annual rate of low-frequency hearing
loss was faster during the 10th decade by the 3.8 dB HL per year at 0.25 kHz, 3.8 dB HL per
year at 0.5 kHz, and 3.2 dB HL per year at 1 kHz. Despite the universal presence of hearing
loss in our sample, 382 patients (59%) used hearing aids.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE There is a significant increase in the rate of hearing loss in
patients during the 10th decade of life compared with the 9th decade that represents a
fundamental change in the mechanistic process of presbycusis. Despite the potential benefit
of hearing aids, they remain underused in the older old. Use may be improved by changing
the method of hearing rehabilitation counseling from a patient-initiated model to a chronic
disease example.

Methods
The institutional review board of Columbia University ap-
proved a search based on the criteria of (1) having an audio-
gramonfileintheDepartmentofOtolaryngology–Head&Neck
Surgery and (2) being older than 80 years at the most recent
audiogram. Pure-tone air conduction thresholds at 0.25, 0.5,
1, 2, 4, and 8 kHz were recorded in decibel hearing level (dB
HL). Speech-reception thresholds, word recognition scores
(WRSs), and the audiologists’classification of the type of hear-
ing loss (sensorineural, conductive, mixed, other, or no hear-
ing loss) were also recorded. Average thresholds between ears
were compared for each individual; the side with the lower av-
erage threshold was designated the better hearing ear.
Participants were divided into 4 age brackets: 80 to 84
years, 85 to 89 years, 90 to 94 years, and 95 years and older.
Average thresholds in the better hearing ears for each fre-
quency were compared across all age brackets with analysis
of variance, and those between pairs of consecutive age brack-
ets were compared with t tests. Effect size was calculated
among age brackets using Cohen d.
To measure the rate of hearing loss, participants with 2 au-
diogramsweredividedinto3groups:(1)bothaudiogramstaken
during the 9th decade of life, (2) first audiogram taken in the
9th decade and second in the 10th decade, and (3) both au-
diogramstakenduringthe10thdecade.Annualaveragethresh-
old differences for better hearing ears at each frequency were
compared across groups with analysis of variance, and those
between 2 consecutive groups were compared with t tests.
Finally,averagethresholdsinthebetterhearingearsateach
frequency were compared between men and women and be-
tween hearing aid users and nonusers with t tests. Average an-
nual threshold differences were also compared between the
same groups using t tests.
Results
The search identified 647 individuals. The mean (SD) and me-
dian age of the study sample was 90 (5.5) years. The majority
of the population had sensorineural hearing loss (Table). On
average, participants had a 10 dB HL difference between the
better hearing ear and worse hearing ear for each frequency
(eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Of the 647 individuals, 141 had
2 audiograms performed after the age of 80 from which the
rate of hearing loss could be calculated.
Thresholds worsened with each older age bracket; how-
ever, individuals in the 95 years and older group had signifi-
cantly worse hearing than those in all the other age brackets
(Figure 1). The difference between individuals in the 95 years
and older and those in the 90 to 94 years bracket was highest
at 0.5 kHz (11.9 dB HL) and was smallest at 8 kHz (5.4 dB HL).
These differences were plotted to show the change in hearing
among age brackets on a population level (Figure 2).
Onanindividuallevel,theannualrateofhearinglossinpa-
tientswith2audiogramswassignificantlyfasterduringthe10th
decade at low frequencies (Figure 3). Specifically, the rates of
decrease were 2.0 vs 3.9 dB HL per year at 0.25 kHz (95% CI,
1.1-2.9 and 3.2-4.6 kHz; Cohen d, 0.4), 2 vs 3.8 dB HL per year
at 0.5 kHz (95% CI, 1.1-2.9 and 3.2-4.5 kHz; Cohen d, 0.3), and
1.9 vs 3.2 dB HL per year at 1 kHz (95% CI, 1.0-2.8 and 2.6-3.7
kHz; Cohen d, 0.3) for the 9th and 10th decades, respectively.

Key Points
Question Is the rate of age-related hearing loss constant in the
oldest old (�80 years)?
Findings This retrospective study demonstrated that the rate of
age-related hearing loss is significantly greater in the 10th decade
of life than in the 9th decade at all frequencies. Despite the
universal presence of hearing loss in the study sample, only 59%
used hearing aids.
Meaning Hearing loss accelerates with age in the oldest old, a
population in which hearing aids are vastly underused despite
their great potential benefit.

Althoughthehearinglossathighfrequencieswasalsofasterdur-
ing the 10th decade, the higher rate was not significant: 2.5 vs
2.7 dB HL per year at 2 kHz (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.7 and 2.1 to 3.2 kHz;
Cohen d, 0.18); 2.1 vs 2.4 dB HL per year at 4 kHz (95% CI, 1.4 to
3.4 and 2.2 to 3.1 kHz; Cohen d, 0.20); and 0.8 vs 2.0 dB HL per
year at 8 kHz (95% C1, −0.1 to 1.6 and 1.6 to 2.4 kHz; Cohen d,
0.1) for the 9th and 10th decades, respectively.
The ratio of women to men in each age bracket increased
with age (Table). Women had better hearing at 4 kHz (eFigure
2 in the Supplement). Men had a faster rate of decrease at 0.25
kHz (eFigure 3 in the Supplement). Otherwise, there was no
difference in hearing or the rate of hearing loss between sexes.
Hearing aid use or disuse was documented in 364 medical
records, and 59% of patients (382 of 647) reported using hear-
ing aids regularly. The percentage of patients who used hearing
aids increased with age, and all participants 95 years and older
reported regular use (Table). On average, hearing aid users had
worsehearingateverythreshold(eFigure4intheSupplement).
The difference was highest at 0.25 kHz (20 dB HL) and least at
8 kHz (10 dB HL). There was no difference in the rate of hearing
decrease regarding thresholds between hearing aid users and
nonusers. The rate of WRS decrease in the general population
was −1.06 WRS per year (eFigure 5 in the Supplement). Hearing
aid users had a significantly faster annual WRS decrease (−2.20
WRS per year) than nonusers (−0.11 WRS per year).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is one of few that examines hear-
ing loss in a large sample of patients older than 80 years. All
participants had hearing loss, defined as more than 25 dB HL
at any frequency.10 The universal presence of hearing loss may
represent an ascertainment bias because patients who re-
ceived care from the Department of Otolaryngology–Head &
Neck Surgery at Columbia University, New York, New York,
were included in this study; however, patients may have pre-
sented to the department for nonhearing-related issues (such
as with sinus or voice). The reason participants were referred
for audiological evaluation could not be determined from the
medical record in the majority of cases, and our results should
therefore be applicable to the general population.
Analysisofhearingamonggroupswasconductedusingthe
better hearing ear, which prevents exaggerating the severity
of hearing loss and underscores the universality of hearing
damage in the older population. The 10 dB HL average differ-
ence between ears is expected because asymmetrical hearing
loss is a common and benign occurrence in the older old.11
Sehl and Yates12 showed that most variables affected by
senescence decrease at a constant percentage per year and
therefore are linear (first-order) functions of age. This finding
means that with each year, the absolute value lost is less than
the prior year because the initial value is lower. We found that
between ages 80 and 94, however, hearing is not a function
of age (zero order). Instead, hearing is lost (dB HL increases)
by the same absolute value each year. Hearing loss may avoid
the type of decrease seen in other aging processes because it
is protective against further acoustic trauma; thus, exposure
decreases as hearing worsens.
In the 95 years and older bracket, however, the rate of de-
crease was significantly faster at low frequencies (0.25, 0.5,
and 1 kHz) than in other age brackets. This result is probable
because there is a biological change in the origin of ARHL that
overcomes any otoprotective effects given by hearing loss in
patients 80 years and older. Although ARHL is normally asso-
ciated with high-frequency hearing loss, several previous
investigations have shown that the rate of hearing damage
increases for low frequencies and decreases with high fre-
quencies throughout the progression of aging. To our knowl-
edge, Glorig et al13 were the first to observe this phenomenon

and proposed that a ceiling effect occurs for the rate of hear-
ing loss, where diminished hearing reserve at higher frequen-
cies results in slower rates of decrease.
Several prospective studies support the ceiling effect
hypothesis.UsingtheBaltimoreLongitudinalStudyofAgingda-
tabase, Brant and Fozard14 found that the rate of decrease in-
creasedatlowfrequencies(0.5-3kHz)inpatientsbetweenages
60 and 79 years, whereas the rate of decrease for high frequen-
cies remained unchanged for those between ages 40 and 89
years. Using the Framingham Heart Study database, Gates and
Cooper15 found that the rate of low-frequency decrease (0.5-2
kHz) was faster for individuals between ages 60 and 69 years
than for those older than 70. A later prospective study by Lee
et al16 showed that worse baseline hearing at high frequencies
(6-8 kHz) correlated with a slower rate of decrease at those
frequencies. Finally, a cohort study by Wiley et al17 found that
individuals in the age 50 to 69 group had its fastest rates of de-
crease at higher frequencies, whereas the age 70 to 89 group
had its fastest rates of decrease at lower frequencies.
Our study adds to this work by examining an older age
group. On a population level, we found that the difference in
hearing among age brackets is significantly larger between the
90 to 94 and 95 years and older ranges (Figure 2). This find-
ing was supported on an individual level: the rate of low-
frequency hearing loss (0.25-1 kHz) for individuals in the 10th
decade is significantly faster than in younger individuals
(Figure 3). Furthermore, the rate of low-frequency decrease
surpasses the rate of high-frequency decrease in the older old
(eFigure 6 in the Supplement). This result is clinically signifi-
cant because we have shown that low-frequency hearing not
only continues to rapidly decrease with age but that the rate
of decrease also increases into older age. Considering that el-
derly patients universally have high-frequency hearing loss,
it becomes obvious that hearing aids should be implemented
for all individuals in their 10th decade, if not sooner.
Prior work has consistently found that women 80 years
and older have less severe hearing loss than men.18 We found
that women had better hearing at 4 kHz, but this is of minor
clinical relevance. Therefore, when a patient is 80 years or
older, sex has a negligible role in hearing. It should be noted,
however, that the proportion of women increased in each suc-
cessive age bracket, which may have diminished any differ-
ences in hearing between sexes.
Theexistingliteratureislessunanimouswhendescribingthe
effectsofsexontherateofdecrease.AlthoughPearsonetal18con-
cluded that hearing decreases twice as fast in males, Gates and
Cooper15 found that hearing reduces slightly faster in females.
Leeetal16foundthatfemalesfrom50to69yearsofagehadfaster
rates of decrease at 4 and 6 kHz, but from 70 to 89 years of age,
there was no difference between sexes at any frequency. We
found that from 80 to 106 years of age, men had a faster rate of
decreaseat0.25kHz.Althoughtheseresultsareconsistentwith
menbeingmoreaffectedbyhearingloss,itisagainofminorclini-
calrelevance,andsex,therefore,shouldnotaffectclinicalprac-
tice when evaluating hearing loss in the older old.
We found that hearing aids were underused in our study
sample. Despite the universal presence of audiometric hear-
ingloss,59%ofpatients(382of647)reportedusingthemregu-
larly. This finding is consistent with other studies that report
on the underuse of hearing aids.6,19 The percentage we show
is higher than prior studies reflecting the increased incidence
of hearing loss in our older study sample.
Hearing aid users were older (all participants older than 95
years used hearing aids) and had poorer hearing; they had sig-
nificantly worse hearing at each tested frequency (eFigure 1 in
theSupplement)andafasterdecreaseinWRSswhencompared
with nonusers. The faster rate of WRS decrease probably rep-
resents inherently worse auditory function in hearing aid us-
ers rather than an effect of hearing aids. This is because when
comparing rates of WRS decrease between the monaurally and
binaurallyhearing-aidedgroups,wefoundthattheunaidedears
inthemonaurallyaidedgrouphadasignificantlyfasterdecrease
than the aided ears in both groups. This finding provides fur-
thersupportfortheunaidedeareffectfirstdescribedbySilman
et al20 and later again by Hurley,21 where it is hypothesized that
the unaided side will have a faster decrease in WRSs due to the
relative deprivation of auditory stimulation.
Patients 80 years and older and those with the worst au-
ditory function use hearing aids despite the entire sample
standing to benefit from them, thus suggesting that hearing
aids are viewed by the public as a last option. Impediments to
comprehensive use include concerns about high cost, com-
plex dispensing procedures, social stigma, and cosmesis. To
overcome these limitations, in September 2015, the Presi-
dent’
s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology recom-
mended federal intervention to improve quality, increase com-
petition,andreducethecostofhearingaids.22Thereisurgency
to increase hearing aid use among the older population be-
cause untreated hearing loss is associated with higher risks for
social isolation, depression, dementia, inability to work, re-
duced physical activity, and falls.
Currently, hearing aid candidates are usually referred to an
otolaryngologist, who may make the recommendation based
on the results of the patient’
s audiogram. Because otolaryn-
gologists rarely contribute to the longitudinal care of most pa-
tients, the recommendation alone probably provides insuffi-
cient motivation for patients to accept hearing aids. We
therefore propose that hearing loss should be treated as a
chronic disease and that the use of hearing aids be thought of
as a lifestyle modification. Audiological evaluations should be
aregularpartofgeriatriccareowingtotheincidenceandsubtle
onsetofhearingloss.Hearingaiduseshouldbeencouragedwith
hearing loss; and the recommendation, cost, cosmesis, and
functional outcome should be discussed. To encourage the ac-
ceptance of hearing aids, we should work to change the nega-
tive perception of hearing aids by educating the patient about
their positive effect on the quality of life, enhancing cogni-
tion, and decreasing the burden of disease.2-8 If a recommen-
dation of hearing aids is resisted, we should use our collective
experience in counseling patients with other chronic dis-
eases,suchasdiabetesandhypertension,andtobaccouseabout
