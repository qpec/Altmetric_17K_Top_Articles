Red meat (beef, veal, pork, lamb and mutton)
consumption contributes several important nutri-
ents to the diet, for example essential amino acids,
vitamins (including B12) and minerals (including
iron and zinc). Processed red meat (ham, sausages,
bacon, frankfurters, salami, etc.) undergoes treat-
ment (curing, smoking, salting or the use of
chemical preservatives and additives) to improve
its shelf life and/or taste. During recent decades,
consumption of red meat has been increasing
globally, especially in developing countries. At the
same time, there has been growing evidence that
high consumption of red meat, especially of pro-
cessed meat, may be associated with an increased
risk of several major chronic diseases. Here, a
comprehensive summary is provided of the accu-
mulated evidence based on prospective cohort
studies regarding the potential adverse health
effects of red meat consumption on major chronic
diseases, such as diabetes, coronary heart disease,
heart failure, stroke and cancer at several sites,
and mortality. Risk estimates from pooled analyses
and meta-analyses are presented together with
recently published findings. Based on at least six
cohorts, summary results for the consumption of
unprocessed red meat of 100 g day�1 varied from
nonsignificant to statistically significantly increa-
sed risk (11% for stroke and for breast cancer, 15%
for cardiovascular mortality, 17% for colorectal
and 19% for advanced prostate cancer); for the
consumption of 50 g day�1 processed meat, the
risks were statistically significantly increased for
most of the studied diseases (4% for total prostate
cancer, 8% for cancer mortality, 9% for breast,
18% for colorectal and 19% for pancreatic cancer,
13% for stroke, 22% for total and 24% for cardio-
vascular mortality and 32% for diabetes). Potential
biological mechanisms underlying the observed
risks and the environmental impact of red meat
production are also discussed. The evidence-based
integrated message is that it is plausible to con-
clude that high consumption of red meat, and
especially processed meat, is associated with an
increased risk of several major chronic diseases
and preterm mortality. Production of red meat
involves
an
environmental
burden.
Therefore,
some European countries have already integrated
these two issues, human health and the ‘health of
the planet’, into new dietary guidelines and rec-
ommended limiting consumption of red meat.
Keywords: cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes,
environment, mortality, red meat.
Introduction
In a report on the global burden of diseases
published in the Lancet on 5 December 2015, diet
was classified as the number one risk factor for a
reduction in global disability-adjusted life years [1].
Red meat is a significant portion of total dietary
intake in many populations, and its consumption
is
increasing
globally.
The
potentially
adverse
health effects of red meat consumption have been
receiving
increasing
attention
in
the
last
few
decades. Using the search term ‘red meat’ in
PubMed, it is clear that there has been a system-
atically increasing annual number of red meat-
related publications: only eight in 1970, 65 in
1990, 309 in 2010 and over 400 in 2015 (Fig. 1).
Red meat consumption emerged in the early 2000s
as a public health concern. Accumulating scientific
evidence has indicated that high consumption of
red meat, especially of processed meat, may be
associated with an increased risk of major chronic
diseases,
including
type
2
diabetes
mellitus
(T2DM), cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer,
and increased mortality risk.
Unprocessed and processed red meat
The term ‘red meat’ encompasses beef, veal, pork,
lamb and mutton. A high concentration of myo-
globin in this type of meat, which in contact with

 oxygen
transforms
to
reddish
oxymyoglobin,
makes myoglobin-rich meats appear red. Pro-
cessed red meat differs from unprocessed meat
in that it undergoes treatment to extend its shelf
life (curing, smoking, salting or the addition of
chemical preservatives). Additives are also intro-
duced
to
improve
flavour,
colour
and
quality
(tenderness,
juiciness
and
cohesiveness).
Pro-
cessed meat usually contains much more sodium
and nitrites/nitrates than unprocessed meat [2].
Examples of processed red meat include ham,
sausages, frankfurters, salami and bacon. There
is large variation worldwide in the percentage of
individuals consuming red meat and processed
meat in various populations. Depending on the
country, the proportion of red meat consumers
varies from below 5% up to almost 100%, and for
processed meat, the proportion ranges from 2% to
65%. Amongst those who consume unprocessed
or processed red meat, the average daily intake is
approximately 50–100 g per person, with high
consumption considered above 200 g per person
[3].
It is well known that red meat is an important
source of proteins, essential amino acids, vitamins
(including B12), minerals (including haeme iron
and zinc) and other micronutrients [4]. However,
red meat may also contain additives introduced
during
processing
and
contaminants
such
as
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs); the contribution
of PCBs from meat was estimated to range from 4%
in Asia to 55% in North America [5]. Meat and
edible offal have been estimated to contribute
approximately 8% of total dietary exposure to
cadmium [6]. Moreover, red meat may contain
residues of antibiotics and hormones used during
production [7]. The practice of cooking meat at high
temperatures (e.g. pan frying and barbecuing) may
lead to the production of heterocyclic amines
(HAAs), which are thought to increase cancer risk
in humans [8]. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs), which are considered to be carcinogenic
and genotoxic, are produced during cooking at
high temperatures over an open flame; grilled/
barbecued meats were estimated to contribute up
to 21% of the intake of benzo(a)pyrene (one form of
PAHs) in the USA [9]. Exposure to high tempera-
tures even for a short period of time can also
generate in meat high levels of advanced glycation
end-products (AGEs), which have been shown to
increase oxidative and inflammatory processes
[10].
Global changes in red meat consumption
In the last several decades, there has been a clear
shift in the dietary patterns towards a high energy-
dense diet, characterized by higher consumption of
foods of animal origin, including red meat. The
annual global production of red meat is as high as
184 million tons (cf. 109 million tons of poultry)
and reflects a high per capita consumption mainly
in high-income countries. However, the consump-
tion of meat in developing countries, where almost
all world population growth currently takes place,
has been growing at 5–6% per annum and large
part of this increase has been red meat consump-
tion [11]. The pork consumption pattern is a good
example of the dietary transition during recent
decades. Americans consumed more pork than
Chinese until 1997 and then this pattern reversed;
during the past decade, per capita consumption of
pork in the USA has been decreasing by 2% a year,
whilst in China there has been a 3% annual
increase.
According
to
statistics
from
the
US
Department of Agriculture for 2011, average per
capita pork consumption was 38 kg in China and
27 kg in the USA [12].

T2DM
Growing evidence indicates that high consumption
of unprocessed red meat and of processed meat is
associated with an increased risk of T2DM. Over
the last decade, a considerable number of prospec-
tive studies have consistently shown that a diet
rich in red and processed meat is associated with

 an increased risk of T2DM. The most recent meta-
analysis has shown an increased risk associated
with the consumption of red meat, in particular
processed meat [13]. Of interest, in a recent study,
for every additional 50 g day�1 of processed meat
consumed,
fasting
glucose
was
significantly
higher; for every additional 100 g day�1 of unpro-
cessed red meat consumed, both fasting glucose
and
insulin
concentrations
were
significantly
higher [14]. However, after adjustment for BMI,
the observed associations were attenuated and no
longer statistically significant. In addition, there
was no modification by genetic loci that influence
glucose or insulin resistance. The conclusion from
a recent systematic review, although based on a
small number of studies, was that a diet high in red
and processed meat before pregnancy was signif-
icantly associated with an increased risk of gesta-
tional diabetes [15].
Potential mechanisms involved in T2DM development
It is not clear which components of red or pro-
cessed meat contribute to the observed risk of
T2DM
and
several
components,
including
branched amino acids (BCAAs), saturated fatty
acids (SFAs), advanced glycation end-products
(AGEs), haeme iron, nitrite, nitrate and nitrosa-
mine, phosphatidylcholine and L-carnitine, have
been proposed. Possible mechanistic pathways,
which might at least partly explain the observed
positive association with an increased T2DM risk,
are presented in Fig. 3. These pathways are briefly
described below and reviewed in more detail by
Kim et al. [16].
Branched amino acids
The BCAAs, such as leucine, isoleucine and valine,
have been positively associated with insulin resis-
tance [17, 18] and with levels of glycated haemo-
globin (HbA1c) [19]. Moreover, increased BCAA
plasma levels have been associated with the devel-
opment of T2DM [20]. Leucine, similar to insulin,
may activate the mammalian target of rapamycin
complex 1 (mTORC1) and ribosomal protein S6
kinase beta1 (S6K1) resulting in serine phospho-
rylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2, which interrupts
signalling [18].
Saturated fatty acids
Saturated fatty acids and cholesterol are present in
red and processed meat and have been reported to
increase insulin resistance [13]. However, given the
mixed
results
from
intervention
studies,
it
is
unclear whether SFAs specifically from red and
processed meat contribute to insulin resistance.
Advanced glycation end-products
During cooking of red and processed meat, AGEs
are produced. Meat is browned during roasting and
barbecuing through the Maillard reaction involving
the breakdown of tetrapyrrole rings in the muscle
protein myoglobin [21]. Red meat and processed
red meat, in particular, have the highest AGE levels
per 100 g food (raw beef, 707 kU; boiled beef
frankfurters, 7484 kU; broiled beef frankfurters,
11 270 kU) [22]. Of the 10–30% of AGEs absorbed
in the intestine, two-thirds are retained in the body
tissues and one-third is excreted in urine and/or
faeces [23]. Findings from human studies indicate
that diet-derived AGEs may be associated with
progression to T2DM [24]. It has been shown that
AGEs may increase the production of C-reactive
protein (CRP), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-
a), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1),
interleukin (IL)-1b and IL-6 by generating reactive
oxygen species (ROS) [25]. A 6-week high-AGE diet
in patients with T2DM increased serum levels of
AGEs, CRP, TNF-a, VCAM-1 and oxidized LDL and
significantly activated NF-kB [26]. It was also
found that an AGE-restricted diet in patients with
T2DM decreased markers of oxidative stress and
inflammation and improved endothelial function
and insulin sensitivity [25, 27]. However, it is still
unclear whether dietary AGEs influence insulin
sensitivity, as current evidence is based on low-
quality studies [24].

 Iron
Red meat is the main source of haeme iron, which
is more easily absorbed (25%) than nonhaeme iron
(5–15%), and a raised iron concentration may
contribute to increased T2DM risk via increased
glucose production and decreased glucose utiliza-
tion [28]. Iron, as a pro-oxidant, participates in the
formation of the highly reactive ROS and may
increase cellular oxidative stress, which can inhibit
insulin binding [29]. ROS can damage pancreatic
b-cells, impair insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine
phosphorylation, decrease PI3K and inhibit the
translocation of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4)
to the plasma membrane [30]. It has been observed
that iron deposition in pancreatic b-cells leads to
impaired insulin secretion [31]. High hepatic iron
stores interfere with hepatic insulin extraction and
increased hepatic glucose output [32]. A summary

ies, including 41 091 control subjects and 4366

Fig. 3 Possible mechanisms linking red and processed meat metabolites to aetiology of type 2 diabetes. Increased
saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake elevates intracellular fatty acyl-CoA and diacylglyceride, which in turn results in the
decreased insulin activation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1)-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in
muscle, leading to the decreased insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity. Elevated advanced glycation end-products
(AGEs) increase the formation of nitric oxide by inducing the expression of nitric oxide synthase and, in turn, impair the
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion through nitric oxide-dependent inhibition of cytochrome C oxidase and ATP synthesis

 T2DM cases, has shown an increased risk of T2DM
amongst
individuals
with
higher
serum
concentrations of ferritin, a biomarker of iron
stores [RRsummary 1.66, 95% confidence interval
(CI) 1.15–2.39 for the highest versus the lowest
quintile; Ptrend = 0.01) [33]. A meta-analysis of four
prospective studies of the association between
dietary haeme iron and risk of T2DM based on
179 689 control subjects and 9246 participants
with T2DM has shown that high intake of dietary
haeme iron is associated with an increased risk of
T2DM (RRsummary 1.31, 95% CI 1.21–1.43 for the
highest versus the lowest quintile) [33]. Data from
these
meta-analyses
based
on
observational
prospective studies show that increased dietary
haeme iron intake and increased stores of iron, as
measured by serum ferritin concentration, are
associated with a higher risk of T2DM. However,
there is currently a lack of evidence from well-
performed randomized controlled interventions on
the impact of reduced iron stores.
Nitrite, nitrate and nitrosamine
Processed meat contains on average about 50%
more nitrates than unprocessed red meat [34].
Nitrites and nitrates used in processed meat for
preservation are converted to nitrosamines by
binding to amino compounds within the food or
in the stomach [35]. It has been shown in animal
studies that nitrosamines are toxic to pancreatic b-
cells, decrease insulin secretion and increase the
risk of T2DM [36, 37]. Nitrosamines contribute to
DNA damage and ROS generation involved in
protein adduct formation, lipid peroxidation and
pro-inflammatory cytokine activation [37]. By con-
trast, dietary nitrites and nitrates may increase
nitric oxide (NO) production and improve microvas-
cular and endothelial dysfunction, hypertension
and insulin sensitivity [38]. However, NO in the
presence of superoxide is transformed into a strong
cytotoxic
oxidant,
peroxynitrite,
which
could
potentially influence T2DM and its complications,
cardiovascular
and
neurodegenerative
diseases
[39].
Sodium
Processed meat may contain on average about
400% more sodium than unprocessed red meat
[34]. Salt/sodium in processed meat may be one
of the factors underlying the observed increase in
T2DM risk. In a prospective study, high con-
sumption of processed meat amongst men sig-
nificantly increased T2DM risk (RR 1.37, 95%
1.11–1.71 for 139 g vs. 28 g daily consumption of
processed meat). After adjustment for sodium,
the observed association was strongly attenuated
and no longer significant; therefore, the authors
concluded that sodium (more than SFAs, choles-
terol, haeme iron or nitrite/nitrate) was respon-
sible for the observed positive association with
T2DM
[40].The
association
between
high
salt
intake
and
insulin
sensitivity
is,
however,
unclear, because available data are conflicting.
Some studies showed an increased insulin sen-
sitivity after severe salt restriction [41], whereas
others showed no change in healthy subjects [42,
43] or reduced insulin sensitivity in hypertensive
subjects [44].
Trimethylamine N-oxide from phosphatidylcholine
and L-carnitine
Phosphatidylcholine and L-carnitine present in
red meat have been reported to be associated
with metabolic disorders and CHD [45, 46]. In the
intestine, phosphatidylcholine is broken down to
choline, which is transformed by the intestinal
microbiota to trimethylamine (TMA), and then
TMA is metabolized to trimethylamine N-oxide
(TMAO) [47]. L-Carnitine is also metabolized by
the microbiota to TMAO. In mice fed a high-fat
diet, dietary TMAO increased fasting insulin levels
and HOMA-IR and produced impaired glucose
tolerance [45]. In a study investigating the asso-
ciation between fasting plasma TMAO concentra-
tion
and
incident
CVD
events
amongst
men
undergoing elective coronary angiography, a high
concentration of TMAO was a significant predictor
of the risk of death, myocardial infarction or
stroke over 3 years [hazard ratio (HR) 1.88, 95%
CI 1.44–2.44 for the highest versus the lowest
quartile) [46].
Endocrine disruptors
Molecules that influence the hormonal system
such as dioxins, phthalates and bisphenol A may
be present in plastic food packaging and conse-
quently even in meat products. Long-term expo-
sure to low levels of endocrine disruptors derived
from red and processed meat might alter glucose
metabolism, as has been observed in rats treated
with a predicted ‘safe’ level of bisphenol A [48].
Endocrine disruptors have been shown to induce
insulin resistance and impair pancreatic b-cell
function [49].
In summary, red and processed meat contain
several components, including natural nutrients
in red meat, but also additives and preservatives,

Cardiovascular disease
Stroke
The overall findings suggest that both unpro-
cessed
and
processed
red
meat
consumption
may be harmful with regard to risk of stroke. In
a recent meta-analysis, results from six prospec-
tive cohorts, published between 2003 and 2012,
on the association between red meat consumption
and risk of stroke incidence and stroke mortality
were quantitatively summarized [50]. The meta-
analysis included data from 329 495 participants
and 10 630 stroke cases (6420 and 1276 cases of
ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, respectively),
including men and women from the USA, Europe
and Japan. There was no heterogeneity amongst
the studies. Consumption of unprocessed
red
meat was positively associated with an increased
risk of stroke; for an increase in the consumption
of
100–120 g day�1:
RRsummary
1.11,
95%
CI
1.03–1.20 for total stroke, RRsummary 1.13, 95%
CI 1.00–1.27 for ischaemic stroke and RRsummary
1.08, 95% CI 0.84–1.39 for haemorrhagic stroke.
Consumption of processed meat was also posi-
tively associated with the increased risk; for an
increase
in
the
consumption
of
50 g day�1:
RRsummary 1.13, 95% CI 1.03–1.24 for total stroke,
RRsummary 1.15, 95% CI 1.06–1.24 for ischaemic
stroke and RRsummary 1.16, 95% CI 0.92–1.46 for
haemorrhagic stroke. Of note, the summary risk
estimates per serving were similar despite the
smaller serving size (50 g) of processed meat as
compared
with
unprocessed
red
meat
(100–
120 g).
Results from the prospective ARIC study (cohort of
11 601 adults amongst whom 699 incident strokes
were diagnosed during 22.7 years of follow-up),
published after the meta-analysis, further con-
firmed the observed positive association between
red meat consumption and stroke incidence (HR
1.38, 95% CI 1.00–1.91 for 1.9 vs. 0.25 servings of
total red meat per day) [51]. Specifically, the
consumption of approximately one serving per
day of unprocessed and processed red meat was
associated

(Ptrend = 0.01)
and
24%
(Ptrend = 0.04) increased risk of stroke, respec-
tively.
Coronary heart disease
The current evidence suggests that high con-
sumption of red meat, both unprocessed and
processed, may increase the risk of CHD. How-
ever, in a recent dose–response meta-analysis of
three prospective cohorts and one case–control
study
including
56 311
participants
and
769
incident events, no association was found between
the consumption of unprocessed red meat and
CHD risk (RRsummary 1.00, 95% CI 0.81–1.23 per
100 g
serving/day)
[34].
Following
this
meta-
analysis, which was limited by the low number
of events, results from the Nurses’ Health Study
(including 84 136 women and 2210 incident non-
fatal myocardial infarctions and 952 deaths due
to
CHD)
showed
a
statistically
significantly
increased CHD risk (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07–1.32
per serving of unprocessed red meat/day) [52].
Nevertheless, this finding needs to be confirmed in
other populations.
The evaluation of processed meat consumption
and incident CHD in a dose–response meta-analy-
sis based on six studies including 614 062 partic-
ipants and 21 308 events [34] indicated that each
50 g serving/day of processed meat was associated
with a 42% higher risk of CHD (RRsummary 1.42,
95% CI 1.07–1.89). In the analysis restricted to
prospective studies, the risk was 44% (7–95%)
higher.
Heart failure
The accumulated evidence regarding the associa-
tion between red meat consumption and risk of HF
is limited to four prospective cohort studies that
have not been quantitatively summarized in a
meta-analysis. In the first study [53] including
14 153 African-American and white participants
and 1140 hospitalizations due to HF, unprocessed
and processed red meat were analysed together
and no statistically significant association was
observed (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.97–1.17 per serv-
ing/day). In another American cohort of 21 120
physicians, amongst whom 1204 new cases of HF
were identified, high consumption of red meat
(unprocessed meat and hotdogs) was associated
with a statistically significantly increased risk of
HF (HR, 1.02, 95% CI 1.01–1.04 per serving/day;
HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.03–1.48 for the highest versus
the lowest quintile) [54]. Unprocessed and pro-
cessed red meats were analysed separately in only
two cohorts. In a cohort of 37 035 Swedish men

 amongst whom 2891 incident cases of HF and 266
deaths from HF were ascertained, the consumption
of
unprocessed
red
meat
was
not
associated
with the increased risk of HF (HR 0.99, 95% CI
0.87–1.13 for median intake of 83.2 g day�1 vs.
17 g day�1) or HF mortality [55]. By contrast, the
consumption of processed meat was statistically
significantly
associated
with
HF;
for
each
50 g day�1 increment in intake, the risk of HF
increased by 8% (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02–1.15) and
HF mortality increased by 38% (HR 1.38, 95%
1.17–1.63). The association between processed red
meat and HF risk was observed for HF with and
without antecedent myocardial infarction. A simi-
lar positive association with processed meat and no
association
with
unprocessed
red
meat
was
observed in a cohort of 34 057 Swedish women,
2806 of whom were diagnosed with HF during
13 years of follow-up [56]. For each 50 g day�1
increase in processed red meat consumption, the
risk of HF in women increased by 11% (HR 1.11,
95% CI 1.04–1.19) in analyses using only baseline
assessment of meat intake and by 19% in analyses
based on long-term dietary data. Overall, results
from these four cohort studies suggest that there
may be an increased risk of HF related to high
consumption of red meat, especially processed red
meat.
Figure 2 shows the magnitudes of the positive
associations observed between unprocessed/pro-
cessed red meat consumption and incidence of
cardiometabolic diseases.
Potential mechanisms involved in CVD development
Although it is not clear which mechanisms related
to the consumption of red and/or processed meat
may be involved in the observed increased risk of
CVD, it is likely that many of these mechanisms
may be the same as those potentially related to the
increased risk of T2DM (Fig. 3).
Cancer
In the last decade, concerns have been raised
about the possibility that the consumption of red
meat and processed meat may increase the risk of
cancer. The summary of all cancer studies by the
World Cancer Research Fund and American Insti-
tute for Cancer Research in 2007 concluded that
the available scientific evidence was convincing
that the consumption of processed and unpro-
cessed
red
meat
was
associated
with
the
increased risk of colorectal cancer [57]. Summary
results
from
the
most
recent
meta-analyses
(2009–2015) based on prospective cohort studies
of
11
cancer
types
[58–68]
are
presented
in
Table 2 and illustrated in Fig. 4. In a recent
pooled analysis of 15 prospective cohort studies
of prostate cancer [59], 52 683 incident cases
(including 4924 cases of advanced prostate can-
cer)
were
identified
during
follow-up
amongst
788 364 men examined within a consortium set-
ting.
For
total
prostate
cancer,
the
observed
associations were weak (2–4% increased risk for
approximately one serving daily of unprocessed
red meat or processed meat; statistically signifi-
cant only for processed meat). For tumours iden-
tified as advanced stage at diagnosis (10 cohorts),
a
stronger
positive
association
was
observed
(RRpooled 1.19, 95% CI 1.01–1.40 for the con-
sumption of ≥100 g day�1 vs. <20 g day�1 unpro-
cessed red meat); the observed association was
stronger in studies of men from North America
(RRpooled 1.30, 95% CI 1.07–1.57).
In October 2015, a Working Group of 22 scientists
from 10 countries met at the International Agency
for Research on Cancer (IARC) in Lyon, France, to
evaluate the carcinogenicity of the consumption of
red and processed meat [3]. They assessed more
than 800 epidemiological studies that investigated
cancer associations with the consumption of red
meat or processed meat in many countries with
diverse diets and races/ethnicities. The Working
Group concluded, based on the large amount of
data and the consistency of the associations across
studies in different populations, that there is
‘sufficient evidence in humans for the carcino-
genicity of the consumption of processed meat’.
Concerning red meat, chance, bias and confound-
ing could not be ruled out with the same degree of
confidence as applied to processed meat, as no
clear association was observed in several of the
large cohort studies. The conclusion of the Working
Group
was
that
there is
‘limited
evidence
in
humans for the carcinogenicity of the consumption
of red meat’ [3].These detailed assessments of more
than 15 different types of cancer will be published
in volume 114 of the IARC Monographs in late
2016.
Potential mechanisms involved in cancer development
Several
mechanisms
have
been
proposed
to
explain the observed associations between red
meat consumption and cancer. It should be noted

 that mechanistic evidence is available mainly for
the digestive tract. Figure 5 illustrates the poten-
tial mechanisms and signalling pathways related to
the iron/haeme iron content in red meat that might
be involved in colon carcinogenesis. One of the
components of red meat, haeme (an iron porphyrin
pigment present at 10-fold higher concentrations
in red meat compared to white meat), has been
ascribed a role in cancer development. Further-
more, free iron is present in red meat and in the
intestinal mucosa [69]. Free ferrous iron is released
from haeme and iron itself plays a role in the
increased production of ROS, especially H2O2,
which may further induce inflammation, cytotoxic
effects and genetic mutations [70, 71]. Red meat
consumption has been shown to initiate epigenetic
changes in DNA [72] and lead to lipid peroxidation
resulting in the formation of oxysterols and alde-
hydes, which could stimulate uncontrolled perox-
idation. It also leads to the production of N-nitroso
compounds (NOCs) by bacteria in the large bowel
and DNA adduct formation [73]. Haeme iron in red
meat
under
certain
conditions
may
act
as
a
nitrosating agent. Processed red meat preserved
by the addition of nitrites and by smoking or direct
fire drying may contribute even further to the
production of NOCs. When beef is consumed, high
levels of malondialdehyde, a known mutagen, are
found in the plasma [74]. The potential mecha-
nisms involved in the carcinogenesis of colon
cancer, and in particular related to the high
content of iron in red meat, have recently been
reviewed in detail [75].
During the cooking of red meat at high tempera-
ture, HAAs are formed. HAAs are genotoxic and
are known to be absorbed in the human gastroin-
testinal tract. The amounts of HAAs produced
depend on the duration and temperature of the
cooking method. Using high-temperature meth-
ods, such as grilling, pan frying and barbecuing,
is associated with higher amounts of HAA pro-
duction. However, in the context of HAA produc-
tion, it should be noted that the type of cooking
method rather than the type of meat cooked may
be
more
important.
HAAs
are
also
produced
during the frying of fish or chicken. Meat smoked
or charred/burned over an open fire or heated
surface contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocar-
bons (PAHs). PAHs have been shown to induce
the formation of DNA adducts and interfere with
apoptosis.
Substantial
supporting
mechanistic
evidence is available especially for haeme iron,
NOCs and HAAs [3].

 Mortality
Interestingly, in an early meta-analysis of five
prospective studies from Western countries, mor-
tality was 16–18% lower amongst occasional meat
eaters, vegetarians and fish eaters, whilst regular
meat eaters and vegans shared the highest mor-
tality [76]. Summary results for mortality from the
most recent meta-analyses of prospective cohort
studies are presented in Table 1 and Fig. 6.
All-cause mortality
Most of the accumulated evidence from observa-
tional epidemiological studies is for all-cause mor-
tality. The summary risk estimates in a recent
meta-analysis of nine prospective cohorts evaluat-
ing mortality risk in relation to the consumption of
unprocessed red meat and processed meat are
based on data from 1 330 352 participants from
the USA (five cohorts), Europe (three cohorts) and
China (one cohort), including 137 376 all-cause
deaths [77]. Processed meat consumption was
statistically significantly associated with increased
risk (RRsummary 1.23, 95% CI 1.17–1.28 for the
highest versus the lowest category of consump-
tion). In a dose–response meta-analysis, the con-
sumption
of
processed
meat
was
significantly
positively associated with all-cause mortality in a
nonlinear fashion (Pnonlinearity = 0.003); comparing
processed meat consumption of 60 g day�1 vs.
10 g day�1, a 22% increase in risk was observed
(RRsummary 1.22, 95% CI 1.13–1.31).
High unprocessed red meat consumption was not
significantly associated with the increased all-
cause mortality (RRsummary 1.10, 95% CI 0.98–
1.22 for the highest versus the lowest category of
consumption). In a dose–response meta-analysis,
an increase in the consumption of unprocessed red
meat
of
100 g day�1
was
associated
with
a
borderline statistically significant 9% increased
risk (RRsummary 1.09, 95% CI 0.997–1.20); hetero-
geneity between studies was observed. In a recent
meta-analysis, the authors identified the source
of the between-study heterogeneity [78]. For the US
populations (four cohorts), a dose–response anal-
ysis showed that each serving per day of unpro-
cessed
red
meat
consumption
was
positively
and statistically significantly associated with risk
of all-cause mortality (RRsummary 1.15, 95% CI
1.12–1.19; no heterogeneity); summaries of results
from European and Asian cohorts did not show
positive associations.
The combination of unprocessed and processed red
meat consumption in predicting all-cause mortal-
ity was examined by Bellavia et al. [79] in a
population-based cohort of 74 645 Swedish men
and women amongst whom 16 683 deaths were
documented during 15 years of follow-up. Com-
pared with no consumption, high consumption of
processed red meat (75 g day�1) was associated
with shorter survival (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.13–1.90).
Moderate and high intakes of unprocessed red
meat were associated with shorter survival only
when accompanied by a high intake of processed
meat. In the analysis stratified by unprocessed and
processed red meat intake, consumption of 65–
100 g day�1 unprocessed red meat was not asso-
ciated with shorter survival when the consumption
of processed meat was limited to ≤20 g day�1 [79]).
More studies are needed to replicate this finding.
CVD mortality
A recent meta-analysis of CVD mortality in relation
to red meat consumption was based on data from
seven prospective cohorts and in relation to pro-
cessed meat on six cohorts, overall including
1 674 272 participants and 44 340 cases of CVD
mortality
[80].

Fig. 5 Potential mechanisms and signalling pathways involved in colon carcinogenesis related to red meat consumption.
Consumption of red meat has been shown to induce epigenetic changes in host DNA. These changes occur specifically
through altering the levels of histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC-2). Unprocessed and processed red meat further contain iron,
haeme and nitrosyl haeme, all of which at high levels may increase the risk of colon cancer development. Both haeme and
nitrosyl haeme undergo catalysis resulting in the formation of N-nitroso compounds (NOCs); these NOCs can result either in
DNA damage or in DNA adduct formation. Red meat consumption specifically leads to mutations in p53 and KRAS genes,
further leading to the initiation and progression of colon carcinogenesis. Alternatively, haeme catalysis can also lead to the
generation of lipid peroxidation end-products, such as malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), oxysterols and
aldehydes. MDA exposure can result in DNA adduct formation, leading to DNA mutations and aberrant proliferation, further
contributing to the initiation of colon cancer. In addition, 4-HNE is a cytotoxic and genotoxic compound, which targets colon
cells that carry a wild-type (wt) APC gene; this selective toxicity results in the enhancement of colon cells that carry a
mutated APC gene, resulting in colon cancer promotion and progression. Additionally, lipid peroxidation results in the
formation of oxysterols and aldehydes, which further alter hormone signalling, specifically transforming growth factor beta
(TGF-b), ultimately resulting in uncontrolled proliferation that contributes to the promotion and progression of colon cancer.
Another major component of red meat is iron; ferric iron (Fe3+) binds to transferrin, resulting in receptor activation and
endocytosis. Ferric iron is further converted to ferrous iron (Fe2+) via divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), which then
contributes to the overall iron pool of the cell. Iron has been linked to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
specifically H2O2; these reactive species can then upregulate inflammatory mediators, such as nuclear factor kappaB (NF
jB), IL-6, IL-8, IL-1b and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), leading to the promotion and progression of colon cancer.
Furthermore, IL-1b signalling upregulates NFjB, which then activates DMT1 iron transporter, resulting in increased levels of
ferrous iron within the cell, representing a feedback loop in iron regulation. Modified from Derry et al. 2013 [75].

 demonstrated that the consumption of unpro-
cessed and processed red meat was statistically
significantly positively associated with CVD mor-
tality. In the dose–response meta-analysis, each
increase in the consumption of unprocessed red
meat by 100 g day�1 was associated with a 15%
higher risk (RRsummary 1.15, 95% CI 1.05–1.26).
The summary risk estimates were higher for the US
populations (four cohorts); comparing the highest
with the lowest intake showed that high consump-
tion of unprocessed red meat was associated with a
37% increased risk of CVD mortality (RRsummary
1.37, 95% CI 1.18–1.59; no heterogeneity). Sum-
maries of the results from two European and four
Asian cohorts did not show positive associations.
Each 50 g day�1 increase in processed meat intake
was associated with a 24% increase in CVD mor-
tality (RRsummary 1.24, 95% CI 1.09–1.40).
Ischaemic heart disease mortality
A meta-analysis of ischaemic heart disease (IHD)
mortality in relation to red meat consumption was
based on data from four prospective cohorts and in
relation to processed meat on three cohorts, overall
including 1 674 272 participants and 1370 cases
of IHD mortality [80]. Summary risk estimates
based on a small number of IHD deaths did not
show a statistically significant association between
the consumption of red meat or processed meat
and IHD mortality.
Cancer mortality
A recent meta-analysis of prospective studies of
unprocessed and processed red meat consumption
in relation to cancer mortality included 1 144 264
participants and 45 738 cancer deaths [78]. The
summary risk estimate for the comparison of the
highest versus the lowest intake of unprocessed
red meat (based on eight cohorts) did not show an
association with cancer mortality (RRsummary 1.03,
95% CI 0.89–1.18). In the dose–response meta-
analysis of processed meat intake, each increase in
consumption by 50 g day�1 was associated with a
statistically significant 8% increase in cancer mor-
tality risk.
Environmental impact of red meat consumption
During the last two decades, red meat consump-
tion has also been receiving an increasing amount
of attention from nonmedical researchers because
of the adverse consequences of red meat produc-
tion on the environment and climate. Red meat is
produced at a major cost to the environment,
leading to greenhouse gas emissions, fossil energy
use, water use and water quality changes as
concentrated livestock operations can be major
water polluters (due to animal waste products,
fertilizers and pesticides) [81]. For example, green-
house gas emissions (expressed as CO2 equivalents
per kg food) related to the production of 1 kg meat
vary substantially, from 50 for lamb, 30 for beef
and 10 for pork to 4 for white meat (chicken, turkey
and game birds) and 2.6 for fish (6.5 for frozen fish)
[82]. Changes in demand for red meat may change
the environmental impact of meat production by
influencing how much meat is produced. It has
been estimated that global meat consumption may
double from 2000 to 2050, mostly as a conse-
quence of an increasing world population, but also
partly because of increased per capita meat con-
sumption, with much of this increase occurring in
the developing world [83].

 (FFQs), which may be influenced by measurement
error. In future, it would be of interest to go beyond
the use of FFQs by also including biomarkers or
metabolomics to study the associations between
unprocessed/processed
red
meat
consumption
and chronic diseases. In addition, some of the
observed results in previous studies may be limited
by
inadequate
adjustment
for
potential
con-
founders. It has been suggested that higher red
meat intake may be a marker of risk due to an
unhealthy lifestyle, rather than a risk factor itself
[84]. Indeed in some populations, it was observed
that consumption of red meat and processed meat
is correlated with a lower-quality diet [85]. More
complete adjustment for a broad spectrum of
potential confounders in future studies could help
to address this potential limitation. It should be
noted, however, that the recent classification of
consumption of red meat (limited evidence) and
processed meat (sufficient evidence) as carcino-
genic, by the WHO/IARC Expert Group, was addi-
tionally
based
on
experimental
animal
and
mechanistic studies that supported evidence from
observational studies [3].
Concerns regarding health hazards related to high
red meat intake and especially processed red meat
intake, both of which have been increasing during
recent decades, have led to new nutrition recom-
mendations and new dietary guidelines proposing
decreased
consumption
of
red
and
processed
meat. So far, however, not all countries and not
all health-related organizations have explicitly and
quantitatively addressed this issue. The first rec-
ommendations regarding the intake of unpro-
cessed and processed red meat, released by the

(AICR)
in
November 2007, based on a review of cancer
publications
up
until
2006,
were
specifically
related to cancer prevention [57]. The general
recommendation to ‘limit intake of red meat and
avoid processed meat’ was accompanied by speci-
fic personal guidelines: ‘people who eat red meat
consume less than 500 g (18 oz) a week, very little
if any to be processed’. These cancer-specific
recommendations
and
quantitative
guidelines
were followed in 2012 by general health-related
dietary
recommendations
in
Nordic
countries
(Nordic Nutrition Recommendations, 2012) [86]
with specific personal guidelines that also quan-
tified intake: ‘eat less red and processed meat, no
more than 500 g a week. Only a small amount of
this should be processed meat’ [87]. Moreover, the
Nordic
Nutrition
Recommendations
considered
not only public health issues but also the envi-
ronmental impact of the recommended diet. The
US Department of Health and Human Services
and
the
US
Department
of
Agriculture
have
released
(7
January
2016)
the
eighth
edition
(2015–2020) of the Dietary Guidelines for Ameri-
cans.
These
new
guidelines
do
not
explicitly
provide
recommendations
regarding
red
meat
and/or
processed
meat
and
do
not
quantify
amounts; they also do not take into account the
environmental impact of dietary patterns [88]. The
most
recently
released
(March
2016)
national
guidelines in the Netherlands, which are very
progressive in many respects, recommend limiting
the consumption of red meat, particularly pro-
cessed
meat
[89].
The
expert
authors
of
the
guidelines concluded that state-of-the-art science
provides
‘plausible’
evidence
to
support
these
meat-related guidelines.
Conclusions
Overall, it is plausible to conclude, taking into
account the available scientific evidence, that high
consumption of red meat, and especially processed
meat, is associated with the increased risk of
several major chronic diseases and preterm mor-
tality. Moreover, the production of red meat also
involves
an
environmental
burden.
Therefore,
some European countries have already integrated
these two issues, human health and the ‘health of
the planet’, into new national dietary guidelines
and recommended limiting the consumption of red
meat.
Conflict of interest statement
Professor Wolk was a member of the WHO/IARC
Working Group evaluating the carcinogenicity of
consumption of unprocessed red meat and pro-
cessed meat in 2015.
