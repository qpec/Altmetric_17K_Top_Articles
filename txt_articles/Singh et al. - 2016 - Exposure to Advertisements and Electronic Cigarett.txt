abstract
BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use among US students increased significantly 
during 2011 to 2014. We examined the association between e-cigarette advertisement 
exposure and current e-cigarette use among US middle school and high school students.
METHODS: Data came from the 2014 National Youth Tobacco Survey (n = 22 007), a survey 
of students in grades 6 through 12. The association between current e-cigarette use and 
exposure to e-cigarette advertisements via 4 sources (Internet, newspapers/magazines, 
retail stores, and TV/movies) was assessed. Three advertising exposure categories 
were assessed: never/rarely, sometimes, and most of the time/always. Separate logistic 
regression models were used to measure the association, adjusting for gender, race/
ethnicity, grade, and other tobacco use.
RESULTS: Compared with students who reported exposure to e-cigarette advertisements 
never/rarely, the odds of current e-cigarette use were significantly (P < .05) greater among 
those reporting exposure sometimes and most of the time/always, respectively, as follows: 
Internet (adjusted odds ratio: middle school, 1.44 and 2.91; high school, 1.49, and 2.02); 
newspapers/magazines (middle school, 0.93 [not significant] and 1.87; high school, 1.26 and 
1.71); retail stores (middle school, 1.78 and 2.34; high school, 1.37, and 1.91); and TV/movies 
(middle school, 1.25 [not significant] and 1.80; high school, 1.24 and 1.54).
CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarette advertisement exposure is associated with current e-cigarette 
use among students; greater exposure is associated with higher odds of use. Given that 
youth use of tobacco in any form is unsafe, comprehensive tobacco prevention and control 
strategies, including efforts to reduce youth exposure to advertising, are critical to prevent 
all forms of tobacco use among youth.

WHAT’S KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT: Tobacco 
advertising prompts experimentation among youth 
and increases and maintains their tobacco product 
use. Many of the themes promoted in advertising for 
conventional tobacco products, including rebellion, 
freedom, rule-breaking, and independence, are 
also currently being used to advertise electronic 
cigarettes (e-cigarettes).
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: E-cigarette advertisement 
exposure on the Internet, in newspapers/magazines, 
in retail stores, and in TV/movies is associated with 
current e-cigarette use among US middle and high 
school students. Greater exposure is associated with 
higher odds of use.

SINGH et al 
Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) 
were first introduced in the United 
States in 2007, and considerable 
increases in the use of these products 
have occurred among US youth in 
recent years. During 2011 to 2014, 
past 30-day e-cigarette use increased 
from 0.6% to 3.9% among US middle 
school students and from 1.5% to 
13.4% among high school students.1 
In 2014, an estimated 2.4 million 
US middle and high school students 
reported past 30-day e-cigarette 
use.1 E-cigarettes typically contain 
tobacco-derived nicotine, which may 
promote addiction, lead to sustained 
tobacco use, and cause lasting harm 
to brain development among 
youth.2, 
3
By 2014, e-cigarettes had become a 
$2.5 billion industry in the United 
States; sales are projected to reach 
$10 billion by the year 2017.4 One 
factor that may be contributing to 
this rapid growth is advertising.5 
Even though cigarette advertising on 
television has been prohibited since 
1971, advertising for e-cigarettes 
currently remains unregulated at the 
federal level. As a result, e-cigarette 
advertising has proliferated in the 
print media, on television, and on 
the Internet; exposure to e-cigarette 
advertisement among youth aged 
12 to 17 years increased by 256% 
from 2011 to 2013.6 This increase 
in youth exposure to e-cigarette 
advertising closely mirrors increased 
dollar expenditures on advertising by 
e-cigarette manufacturers; between 
2011 and 2014, the estimated 
e-cigarette advertising expenditures 
increased from $6.4 million to 
$115.3 million.7, 
8 Although paid 
advertisements on TV comprise the 
majority of e-cigarette advertisement 
expenditures, other media requiring 
less marketing costs, such as the 
Internet, also have been used widely 
for e-cigarette advertisements.6, 
9 
Some e-cigarette advertisements also 
use similar themes and tactics found 
by the Surgeon General to promote 
conventional tobacco use among 
youth, including rebellion, freedom, 
rule-breaking, and independence.2, 
9
Previous research indicates that 
conventional cigarette advertising is 
associated with increased product 
appeal, intent to smoke, initiation, 
and use among youth.2 Studies on 
e-cigarette advertising have found 
positive reactions to e-cigarette 
advertisements among college 
students, 
10 and more favorable 
attitudes and intentions to use 
e-cigarettes among adolescents 
exposed to e-cigarette advertising.5 
A study in US middle and high 
school students found exposure to 
tobacco advertisements in general 
and not specifically e-cigarettes 
to be associated with greater 
experimentation.11 However, to 
date, no study has assessed the 
association between exposure to 
different sources of e-cigarette 
advertising and current e-cigarette 
use among US youth. To address this 
gap in the literature, we examined 
the association between e-cigarette 
advertisement exposure and current 
e-cigarette use among a nationally 
representative sample of US middle 
and high school students.
METHODS
Sample
Data came from the 2014 National 
Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS), an 
annual, school-based, cross-sectional 
survey that collects information on 
key tobacco indicators from middle 
(grades 6 to 8) and high school 
(grades 9 to 12) students.12 A total 
of 22 007 students completed the 
NYTS questionnaire in 2014, yielding 
an overall response rate of 73.3%. 
The sample included 10 419 middle 
school students, 11 399 high school 
students, 18 respondents who 
indicated “ungraded or other grade, 
” 
and 171 respondents who did not 
indicate a grade.
Measures
Current E-Cigarette Use
Survey respondents were asked 
whether they used e-cigarettes in 
the past 30 days using the following 
question, “During the past 30 days, 
on how many days did you use 
electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes 
such as Blu, 21st Century Smoke, or 
NJOY?” Respondents who answered 
≥1 days in the past 30 days were 
categorized as current e-cigarette 
users; those who answered 0 days in 
the past 30 days were categorized as 
not current e-cigarette users.
Exposure to E-Cigarette Advertisements
Self-reported exposure to e-cigarette 
advertisements on the Internet, 
in newspapers/magazines, in 
retail stores, and in TV/movies 
was assessed separately using the 
following questions: “When you 
are using the Internet, how often 
do you see ads or promotions for 
electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes?”; 
“When you read newspapers or 
magazines, how often do you see 
ads or promotions for electronic 
cigarettes or e-cigarettes?”; “When 
you go to a store, supermarket, or gas 
station, how often do you see ads or 
promotions for electronic cigarettes 
or e-cigarettes?”; and “When you 
watch TV or go to the movies, how 
often do you see ads or promotions for 
electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes?”
For each question, categorical 
response options were: “never, 
” 
“rarely, 
” “sometimes, 
” “most of the 
time, 
” and “always.” Respondents 
were also allowed to indicate if they 
did not access the specified sources 
(eg, “I do not use the Internet”). 
For each source assessed, exposure 
status was classified into three 
categories as follows: “never/rarely, 
” 
“sometimes, 
” and “most of the 
time/always.”13 Respondents who 
indicated that they did not access 
the specified source or had missing 
data for the specified source were 
excluded from the analyses (Internet, 
n = 1457, 6.6%; newspapers/

magazines, n = 6315, 28.7%; retail 
stores, n = 1478, 6.7%; television/
movies, n = 1468, 6.7%).
Demographics
Assessed demographic 
characteristics included: gender 
(female or male); race/ethnicity 
(non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic 
black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic 
other [including non-Hispanic 
Asians, American Indians, Alaska 
Natives, Native Hawaiians, or Pacific 
Islanders]); and grade (sixth, seventh, 
and eighth for middle school; ninth, 
10th, 11th, and 12th for high school).
Other Tobacco Product Use
Survey respondents were also 
asked about current (past 30-day) 
use of other tobacco products, 
including cigarettes, cigars/
cigarillos/little cigars, pipes, bidis, 
hookah, chewing tobacco, snuff, dip, 
dissolvable tobacco, and snus. These 
products were categorized as either 
combustible (cigars/cigarillos/little 
cigars, pipes, bidis, or hookahs) or 
noncombustible (chewing tobacco, 
snuff, dip, dissolvable tobacco, 
or snus). Current use of other 
tobacco product use was used to 
categorize respondents into four 
mutually exclusive categories: no 
tobacco use, combustible tobacco 
only use, noncombustible tobacco 
only use, and both combustible and 
noncombustible tobacco use.
Analysis
Data were analyzed by using 
SAS-callable SUDAAN version 11 
to provide weighted results that 
accounted for the complex sample 
design. Descriptive analyses were 
used to calculate point estimates 
and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs). Exposure to e-cigarette 
advertisements was assessed overall 
and by current e-cigarette use for 
4 sources: Internet, newspapers/ 
magazines, retail stores, and 
television/movies. Separate 
logistic regression models were 
fitted for each source of e-cigarette 
advertisement, by school level. 
Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios 
were calculated for each model; 
the adjusted models controlled for 
gender, race/ethnicity, grade, and use 
of other tobacco product types.
Additionally, to assess the influence 
of frequency of e-cigarette use in 
the past 30 days on exposure to 
e-cigarette advertising, sensitivity 
analyses were conducted comparing 
exposure among those reporting any 
e-cigarette use (even once) in the past 
30 days to those reporting greater 
frequencies of use, including “1 or 
2 days” or “3 or more days, 
” in the 
past 30 days. The findings from this 
analysis revealed that the adjusted 
odds ratios (AORs) for the association 
between e-cigarette advertising 
exposure and e-cigarette use did not 
differ significantly between those 
reporting any e-cigarette use (even 
once) in the past 30 days to those 
reporting greater frequencies of use, 
thus supporting the validity of the 
broader past 30-day measure.
RESULTS
Advertisement Exposure by 
E-Cigarette Use Among Middle 
School Students
Among middle school students, the 
proportion of current e-cigarette users 
and current e-cigarette nonusers who 
reported being exposed to e-cigarette 
advertisements on the Internet was 
as follows: rarely/never, 41.3% 
and 63.9%; sometimes, 27.3% and 
25.2%; and most of the time/always, 
31.4% and 10.8%, respectively (Table 
1). Similar patterns of exposure 
among current e-cigarette users and 
current e-cigarette nonusers were 
seen for other sources of e-cigarette 
advertising.
Advertisement Exposure by 
E-Cigarette Use Among High School 
Students
Among high school students, the 
proportion of current e-cigarette users 
and current e-cigarette nonusers who 
reported being exposed to e-cigarette 
advertisements on the Internet was 
as follows: rarely/never, 43.2% 
and 57.7%; sometimes, 38.1% and 
31.5%; and most of the time/always, 
18.7% and 10.8%, respectively (Table 
1). Similar patterns of exposure 
among current e-cigarette users and 
current e-cigarette nonusers were 
seen for other sources of e-cigarette 
advertising.
Association Between E-Cigarette 
Advertisement Exposure and 
E-Cigarette Use Among Middle 
School Students
After controlling for covariates, 
compared with middle school 
students who reported exposure 
to e-cigarette advertising on the 
Internet never/rarely, the odds of 
current e-cigarette use were higher 
for those who reported exposure to 
e-cigarette advertising sometimes 
(AOR 1.44, 95% CI 1.03–2.00) and 
most of the time/always (AOR 2.91, 
95% CI 1.89– 4.47) (Table 2). For 
newspapers/magazines, odds of 
current e-cigarette use was higher 
among those exposed most of the 
time/always (AOR 1.87, 95% CI 
1.21–2.87). For retail stores, odds 
were higher among those exposed 
sometimes (AOR 1.78, 95% CI 1.30–
2.45) and most of the time/always 
(AOR 2.34, 95% CI 1.70–3.23). For 
television/movies, odds were higher 
among those exposed most of the 
time/always (AOR 1.80, 95% CI 1.30–
2.49) compared with never/rarely.
Association Between E-Cigarette 
Advertisement Exposure and 
E-Cigarette Use Among High School 
Students
After adjustment, compared with 
high school students who reported 
exposure to e-cigarette advertising 
on the Internet never/rarely, odds 
of current e-cigarette use were 
higher for those exposed sometimes 
(AOR 1.49, 95% CI 1.22–1.84), and 
most of the time/always (AOR 2.02, 
95% CI 1.66–2.46) (Table 2). For 
newspapers/magazines, odds of

current e-cigarette use were higher 
among those exposed sometimes 
(AOR 1.26, 95% CI 1.01–1.55), 
and most of the time/always (AOR 
1.71, 95% CI 1.25–2.33). For retail 
stores, odds were higher among 
those exposed sometimes (AOR 
1.37, 95% CI 1.08–1.73), and most 
of the time/always (AOR 1.91; 95% 
CI 1.56–2.35). For TV/movies, odds 
were higher among those exposed 
sometimes (AOR 1.24, 95% CI 
1.04–1.50), and most of the time/
always (AOR 1.54, 95% CI 1.28–1.86) 
compared with never/rarely.
DISCUSSION
The findings from this study 
indicate that exposure to e-cigarette 
advertisements on the Internet, in 
newspapers/magazines, in retail 
stores, and in TV/movies was 
associated with current e-cigarette 
use among US middle and high 
school students. Among middle 
school students, greater exposure 
to e-cigarette advertisements on the 
Internet and in retail stores were 
associated with higher odds of use.

Among high school students, greater 
exposure to e-cigarette advertising 
from all 4 sources was associated 
with higher odds of use. These 
findings suggest that comprehensive 
tobacco prevention and control 
strategies, including efforts to reduce 
youth exposure to advertising, 
are critical to prevent all forms 
of tobacco use among US youth, 
including e-cigarettes.
Findings from the current study are 
consistent with previous research 
demonstrating increased curiosity 
and intention to use e-cigarettes 
in youth exposed to e-cigarette 
advertisements.14, 
15 For example, 
in a randomized controlled trial, 
adolescents who viewed e-cigarette 
TV advertisements were 54% more 
likely to say they would try an 
e-cigarette soon, and 43% more likely 
to say they would try an e-cigarette 
within the next year, compared with 
adolescents who were not exposed to 
the e-cigarette TV advertisements.5 
They also were more likely to agree 
that e-cigarettes can be used in places 
where smoking is not allowed.5 
Moreover, active use of e-cigarettes 
in advertisements may serve as cues 
to smoke for both current and former 
smokers by stimulating an urge to 
smoke and thoughts about smoking 
cigarettes.16, 
17 E-cigarette marketing 
has included unproven claims of 
safety and use for smoking cessation, 
and statements that they are exempt 
from clean air policies that restrict 
smoking.18 These messages could 
promote situational substitution of 
e-cigarettes when smokers cannot 
smoke cigarettes, rather than 
complete substitution of e-cigarettes 
for conventional cigarettes; as well as 
undermine clean indoor air standards, 
smoke-free policy enforcement, and 
tobacco-free social norms.
Almost all tobacco use begins before 
the age of 18, during which time 
there is great vulnerability to social 
influences.2 It is well established 
that tobacco advertising can entice 
tobacco experimentation, as well 
as increase and maintain tobacco 
product use among youth and young 
adults.2 Tobacco companies have 
marketed tobacco using youth-
oriented advertising. US District 
Court Judge Gladys Kessler found 
“beyond any reasonable doubt” [that 
tobacco companies] “have marketed 
to young people 21 and under while 
consistently, publicly, and falsely 
denying they do so.”2, 
19, 
20 Some 
e-cigarette companies are using 
techniques similar to those used by 
cigarette companies that have been 
shown in the 2012 Surgeon General’s 
Report to increase use of cigarettes 
by youth, including candy-flavored 
products; youth-resonant themes 
such as rebellion, glamour, and sex; 
celebrity endorsements; and sports 
and music sponsorships.2, 
9, 
21 This 
situation is compounded by the fact

SINGH et al 
that an emerging body of research has 
linked e-cigarette use with subsequent 
initiation of conventional cigarettes 
among youth and young adults. For 
example, a longitudinal study of 
14-year-old adolescents found that 
e-cigarette users who did not use 
combustible tobacco at baseline were 
more likely to initiate combustible 
tobacco use at 1-year follow-up.22 
Similar results were observed in 
another longitudinal cohort study 
in US adolescents and young adults, 
in which the use of e-cigarettes 
at baseline was associated with 
progression to traditional cigarette 
smoking.23 This evidence suggests the 
importance of public health strategies 
to address tobacco advertising 
exposure among youth.
In 2009, the Family Smoking 
Prevention and Tobacco Control 
Act gave the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) the authority to 
regulate the manufacture, marketing, 
and distribution of tobacco products. 
In April 2014, FDA issued a proposed 
rule to deem all products made or 
derived from tobacco subject to FDA 
jurisdiction, including e-cigarettes, 
cigars, pipe tobacco, dissolvables, 
gels, and waterpipe tobacco.24 The 
agency is reviewing public comments 
on the proposed rule.24 As required 
by the Tobacco Control Act, FDA will 
need to use a public health standard 
to evaluate regulatory strategies at 
both the individual and population 
levels, including impacts on initiation, 
cessation, and reinitiation by former 
tobacco users.25 The Tobacco Control 
Act also preserves the authority 
of states, localities, and tribes to 
adopt measures “relating to the sale, 
distribution, possession, exposure to, 
access to, advertising and promotion 
of, or use of tobacco products by 
individuals of any age.”25 State and 
local strategies that could reduce 
youth marketing exposure include 
content-neutral restrictions on 
advertising; limits on internet sales 
of all tobacco products, including 
e-cigarettes; and tobacco retail outlet 
restrictions, including limits on 
outlet density and location and/or 
requirements that tobacco sales take 
place in adult-only facilities.26, 
27
Findings from this study are subject 
to at least 3 limitations. First, data 
were collected only from youth 
who attended either public or 
private schools and might not be 
generalizable to youth of similar age 
who are being home-schooled, those 
who have dropped out of school, or 
those in detention centers. However, 
data from the Current Population 
Survey indicate that 98.2% of US 
youths aged 10 to 13 years and 
96.1% of those aged 14 to 17 years 
were enrolled in a traditional school 
in 2013.28 Second, data were self-
reported and are subject to potential 
misreporting. Finally, data were 
cross-sectional, and thus, causal 
relationships between e-cigarette 
advertising and use cannot be made. 
Current e-cigarette users might 
notice e-cigarette advertisements 
more than nonusers. Future studies 
with longitudinal follow-up are 
important to address this limitation by 
confirming if exposure to e-cigarette 
advertising leads to e-cigarette use 
among youth.
CONCLUSIONS
The findings from this nationally 
representative study of US middle 
and high school students found that 
e-cigarette advertisement exposure 
was associated with e-cigarette use, 
and greater exposure was associated 
with higher odds of use. Given that 
youth use of tobacco in any form 
is unsafe, comprehensive tobacco 
prevention and control strategies, 
including efforts to reduce youth 
exposure to advertising, are critical 
to prevent use of all tobacco products 
among youth.
