The public health threat posed by a looming ‘post-antibiotic’ era necessitates new approa-
ches to antibiotic discovery. Drug development has typically avoided exploitation of
membrane-binding properties, in contrast to nature’s control of biological pathways via
modulation of membrane-associated proteins and membrane lipid composition. Here, we
describe the rejuvenation of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin via selective targeting of
bacterial membranes. Peptide libraries based on positively charged electrostatic effector
sequences are ligated to N-terminal lipophilic membrane-insertive elements and then con-
jugated to vancomycin. These modified lipoglycopeptides, the ‘vancapticins’, possess
enhanced membrane affinity and activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) and other Gram-positive bacteria, and retain activity against glycopeptide-resistant
strains. Optimised antibiotics show in vivo efficacy in multiple models of bacterial infection.
This membrane-targeting strategy has potential to ‘revitalise’ antibiotics that have lost
effectiveness against recalcitrant bacteria, or enhance the activity of other intravenous-
administered drugs that target membrane-associated receptors.

 A
ntibiotic resistant bacteria pose a grave threat to human
health and there now is an urgent need to develop new
antibiotics1–5. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA), a major cause of community and hospital-acquired
infections, leads to significant morbidity and mortality1, 6, 7.
Vancomycin is often used to treat MRSA infections, but clinical
isolates that are resistant are increasingly common6: VISA –
vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus: MIC (minimum inhibitory
concentration) 4–8 μg mL−1; hVISA – heteroresistant VISA:
predominantly susceptible but with a resistant subpopulation;
and, more rarely7, VRSA – vancomycin-resistant S. aureus:
MIC ≥ 16 μg mL−1. Even moderate reductions in vancomycin
susceptibility (MIC shift from ≤1 to 1.5–2.0 µg mL−1) can lead to
significantly worse clinical outcomes6, 8, 9. In the last 15 years
antimicrobial agents such as daptomycin and linezolid have
emerged as approved therapeutic compounds for vancomycin-
resistant bacteria10, but resistance to both of these antibiotics was
identified in vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and MRSA
shortly after their approval11, 12.
Drug development traditionally focuses on optimising target
affinity, selectivity and protein binding in the context of drug
pharmacodynamics13, but rarely assesses membrane-binding
properties14. In contrast, nature exploits subtle changes in the
composition of biological membranes to control signal trans-
duction,
vesicular
transport
and
receptor
recycling
with
membrane-associated proteins such as Ras15, Src16, Rab17, HIV-1
GAG18 and MARCKS19. In these proteins, N-terminal and/or
C-terminal lipophilic groups (myristoyl, palmitoyl, geranyl,
farnesyl) and clusters of basic amino acids act as an electrostatic
‘switch’ to control translocation between the cytosol and mem-
brane surface via selective phosphorylation of serine and tyrosine
residues16, 20, 21. We postulated that appending such motifs to
drugs acting on membrane-associated targets could enhance
membrane binding and concomitantly increase drug concentra-
tion at the target site20. The potential also exists to discriminate
between different types of membranes to increase drug selectivity.
Given the alarming rise of multi-drug resistant bacteria and
paucity of new antibiotics in the pipeline, we validated this
approach using the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin.
In this study, we designed and synthesised a series of vanco-
mycin derivatives, designated vancapticins, by appending mem-
brane targeting motifs onto the C-terminus of vancomycin. The
vancapticins display Gram-positive activity, including activity
against vancomycin-resistant strains. The vancapticins were
highly efficacious in multiple infections models in mice, with a
low propensity for innate and induced resistance, and a phar-
macokinetic (PK) profile consistent with once daily dosing in
humans. Taken together, these results suggest vancapticins could
be candidates for further development as a promising new ther-
apy for the treatment of antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive bac-
terial infections.
Results
Chemical design of a membrane targeting motif. Vancomycin
blocks cell wall synthesis by binding to the C-terminal tripeptide
(L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala) of the peptidoglycan precursor Lipid II, pre-
venting cross-linking by bacterial transglycosylases and transpep-
tidases. A ‘back-to-back’ dimerisation enhances antimicrobial
activity via a surface-templated chelate effect with membrane-
bound Lipid II22, 23. In developing a membrane-targeting vanco-
mycin analogue, it was important not to occlude the peptide
binding site, nor disrupt interactions at the dimer interface. Pre-
vious derivatisations of vancomycin have utilised the vancosamine
sugar amine or heptapeptide free carboxyl group;24 other mod-
ification sites are possible, but more synthetically challenging. In
order to attach basic electrostatic effector peptide segments con-
taining lipophilic membrane-insertive elements (MIE), using
chemistry compatible with unprotected functionality, we amidated
vancomycin with pyridyldithioethylamine, then selectively ligated
unprotected basic peptides containing a C-terminal Cys residue
under mild conditions via disulphide exchange (Fig. 1, Y = S–S;
Supplementary Figs. 1–3). The initial membrane targeting glyco-
peptides employed a lipophilically acylated 16-mer electrostatic
effector peptide sequence (EEPS) (GSSKSPSKKKKKKPGD)25, 26.
These conjugates were fourfold to tenfold more active than van-
comycin and daptomycin against MRSA, VISA and multi-drug
resistant (MDR) Streptococcus pneumoniae, and more than 100-
fold more active than vancomycin against VanA Enterococcus
faecium (VRE) (Table 1). The corresponding non-ligated lipophilic
peptides alone were not active, while equimolar mixtures of the
same peptides with vancomycin displayed no synergy (Table 2).
For the disulphide-linked series, maximal activity across most
strains was observed with a dodecanoyl (MIE = nC11CO) insertive
element, with potency dropping for both shorter and longer alkyl
chain elements (compare 6, 7, 9 in Table 1). A biphenyl insertive
element 10 provided comparable activity to the best alkyl chains.

 sequence did not compromise activity (11–15), and led to
improved activity for a minimal basic KKK motif.
Linker strategy leads to improvements in metabolic stability.
Initial in vivo studies indicated that the disulphide-linked con-
jugates possessed a very short half-life, consistent with in vitro
studies showing instability in human plasma (Supplementary
Table 2) or in the presence of physiological concentrations of
glutathione (Supplementary Fig. 4). We therefore replaced the
Cys-derived linker with a stable attachment through the side
chain of Lys (Fig. 1, Y = CH2, Supplementary Figs. 5–9), with the
new compounds maintaining the desirable activity of the
disulphide-linked pilot series. The best compounds were 20-fold
to more than 100-fold more potent than vancomycin or dapto-
mycin against MRSA, and significantly more active against VISA,
VRSA and VRE (Tables 1 and 3), with inhibitory activity as good,
or
better
than,
recently
approved
glycopeptide
antibiotics
telavancin, dalbavancin and oritavancin. They showed similar
high levels of potency (e.g. MIC ≤ 0.03 µg mL−1) against other
Gram-positive strains, including daptomycin-resistant MRSA,
MDR S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and S. epidermidis, but were
inactive against Gram-negative Escherichia coli (data not shown).
Importantly, these new compounds were stable when exposed to
plasma (Supplementary Table 2) and glutathione (Supplementary
Fig.
4),
and
were
resistant
to
microsomal
metabolism
(Supplementary Table 3).
Vancapticins possess promising drug-like properties. The
lysine-linked compounds possessed low cytotoxicity against
human cell lines (HepG2 and HEK293, with CC50 over 1000-fold
higher than the MIC for most compounds, even when tested with
cells grown in only 1% serum to maximise cell sensitivity and
availability of free compound) (Supplementary Table 4), and
demonstrated minimal haemolysis of human erythrocytes in
whole blood (most compounds were still non-haemolytic at 1600
µg mL−1, over 10,000-fold higher than the MIC) (Supplementary
Table 5). Antibiotic activity was measured both in the absence
and presence of 50% human serum (Table 1), with the serum-
induced reversal in activity (varying from 1-fold to 100-fold) used
as a surrogate to estimate of the extent of protein binding. The
compounds retained activity in the presence of an artificial lung
surfactant (1% or 5% Survanta (Beractant), Supplementary
Table 6), which reduces the activity of some antibiotics such as
daptomycin27 and makes them unsuitable for the treatment of
lung infections. Vancapticin 24 was shown to be slowly bacter-
icidal in a similar manner to vancomycin (Fig. 2).

 It is important that new antibiotics are not susceptible to innate
or induced resistance. Compound 19 showed a low resistance
frequency (a measure of the existing propensity for resistance) of
9.4 × 10−10
against
MRSA
(ATCC
43300)
(Supplementary
Table 7). Both 17 and 24 induced low levels of resistance
compared to daptomycin when MRSA (ATCC 43300) cultures
were serially cultured over 20 days in the presence of increasing
sub-lethal antibiotic concentrations (Fig. 3).
Structure-activity relationships. Structure-activity relationship
studies using the stable linker series focused on variations in the
insertive element and basic EEPS peptides. Subtle variations were
observed between bacteria, with S. aureus and S. pneumoniae
reaching maximal inhibition with dodecanoic acid (MIE =
nC11CO), while E. faecium exhibited greater sensitivity toward
longer alkyl groups >C12 (Table 3). However, these longer alkyl
elements led to both increasing serum reversal and cytotoxicity,
with undecanoic acid (MIE = nC10CO) providing an optimum
compromise. In contrast, removal of the lipidic component
altogether diminished activity (compare 25 vs. 19) highlighting
the importance of the insertive element for antimicrobial potency.
Variation of the charged region from zero to three Lys residues
(18–20) (Table 1) led to minor improvements in serum-free
antibacterial activity, but the increasing charge caused variations
in serum reversal and increased potency against E. faecium,
particularly compared to 20 with no basic residue. A dibasic
sequence (KK) was selected as optimum. Enantiomeric all
D-amino acid effector sequences or linkers were equipotent with
the natural L-amino acids, as were replacements of Lys with Orn
or
Dab,
suggesting
that
no
chiral
molecular
recognition
was involved (Table 3).
Demonstration
of
efficacy
against
MRSA
and
MDR
S. pneumoniae. We next examined the PK profiles of compounds
18, 19, 21 and 24 in mice (Fig. 4). When compared to the murine
profiles of daptomycin28 and telavancin29, our compounds
exhibited profiles consistent with extrapolated once-daily dosing
in man, representing a significant advantage over the twice daily
dosing most commonly used for vancomycin. In mouse plasma,
compound levels were maintained at concentrations above the
MRSA MIC (determined in the presence of serum) for over 12 h
following a single 10 mg kg−1 subcutaneous (SC) dose (Fig. 4,
Supplementary Tables 8 and 9). While the PK/PD driver for
vancomycin is now believed to be the area under the unbound
drug concentration-time curve [fAUC]/MIC, historically the
percentage of a 24-h time period that the unbound drug con-
centration exceeds the MIC [fT>MIC] was initially reported to be a
better predictor of the antibacterial effect so is still useful as an
approximation30.
The new compounds showed potent bactericidal efficacy in a
neutropenic mouse thigh infection model against MRSA. A single
25 mg kg−1 subcutaneous (SC) dose of 19 was equivalent to a
single 200 mg kg−1 dose of vancomycin, with a 6-log reduction
compared to the saline control at 24 h (Fig. 5a). Activity was still
maintained at 5 mg kg−1 for 19, while vancomycin was almost
inactive at 25 mg kg−1. Highly protein bound 24 was less effective,
but other analogues such as 21 were equally active. Both 19 and
24, when tested in an alternate lung infection model using
intratracheal administration of a lethal dose of S. pneumoniae,
resulted in 100% survival after 10 days (Fig. 5b). The results from
the pneumonia model were consistent with in vitro MIC testing
that showed activity was maintained in the presence of artificial
lung surfactant, in contrast to the loss of activity observed with
daptomycin, which is ineffective at treating pneumonia31. Finally,
19 and 24 were tested in an intra-peritoneal (IP) infection model
using bioluminescent methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) Xen-
29, with imaging at 9 h post infection again showing good efficacy
for 19, but a reduced activity for 24 (Fig. 5c–e).
Assessment of Lipid II binding mechanism of action. Vanco-
mycin acts by inhibiting the transpeptidase step of peptidoglycan
synthesis, although there is also evidence of blocking the previous
transglycosylase step32. Kahne and co-workers have reported that
vancomycin group antibiotics with lipophilic substituents (e.g. a
biphenyl group) differ from vancomycin by acting primarily via
transglycosylase inhibition33. The remarkable activity of our
compounds could be due to a number of factors: (i) an increased
affinity for the target terminal D-Ala-D-Ala dipeptide of Lipid II,
(ii)
enhanced
dimerisation
leading
to
higher
avidity
for
membrane-bound Lipid II34, (iii) an additional or different mode
of action or target than vancomycin (such as membrane per-
meabilisation), and/or (iv) membrane localisation resulting in an
enhanced drug concentration at the membrane surface, which
could serve to enhance any of the above.

targeted Lipid II and peptidoglycan synthesis (Fig. 6e, Supple-

penta-peptide components of Lipid II showed overall similar

was found to be similar to that for vancomycin (Supplementary
Table 11, Supplementary Fig. 12), and increased in the presence
of ligand. Hence, neither enhanced ligand binding nor dimerisa-

later by a single subcutaneous dose of antibiotic at concentrations indicated, with sacrifice and bacterial load determination in homogenised thighs at 24 h post
treatment (26 h post infection): n = 10 (five mice per group, two thighs per mouse; errors are mean ± SEM). A significant difference was found between saline at
26 h and vancomycin 1 at 200 mg kg−1 (p < 0.0001), and vancapticin 19 at both 25 mg kg−1 (p < 0.0001) and 5 mg kg−1 (p = 0.0011). No statistical difference was
found for vancomycin 1 at 25 mg kg−1 or vancapticin 24 at 25 mg kg-1 compared to saline. Vancapticin 19 at 25 mg kg-1 also showed a significant reduction
compared to the initial t = 2 h baseline inoculum (p = 0.0014) whereas vancomycin 1 at 200 mg kg-1 was not statistically significant. Statistical analysis done

interest (ROI) covering the infection sites. The saline treated group showed a large increase in the total flux, particularly after 3 h (T = 3 h). Daptomycin,
vancomycin and 19 treated groups showed a progressive reduction in the bioluminescence signal 1 h after inoculation, while the signal detected from 24 increased
slightly. All antibiotic administered groups showed reduced bioluminescence signal at T = 9 h compared to immediately after inoculation (p < 0.001 for all groups;
errors are mean ± S.D). d Changes in CFU per spleen after 9 h. Individual spleens were homogenised and diluted for plating. The calculated CFU/spleen counts

 L-glycerol, DMPG) over zwitterionic (dimyristoyl-L-α-phospha-
tidylcholine, DMPC) lipid bilayers (Fig. 7a). To discount the
possibility that enhanced antimicrobial activity resulted from
non-specific membrane-based perturbation effects similar to
those induced by cationic antimicrobial peptides35, membrane
effects of the new compounds were assessed. Aggregation was
discounted as a source of membrane activity as the critical micelle
concentration (CMC) was found to exceed 100 µM for selected
compounds 17, 19 and 23. Furthermore, compounds were gen-
erally non-haemolytic against human erythrocytes in whole blood
at 1600 µg mL−1, with any haemolysis observed not correlating
with lipophilicity (Fig. 7b and Supplementary Table 5).
Evidence for membrane perturbation was obtained in the
presence of membrane-selective fluorescent probes. First, we
employed the membrane potential-sensitive cationic fluorescent
probe 3,3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide [diSC3(5)], which is
prevented from partitioning to the surface of polarised cells
during disruption of membrane potential, causing dye release into
the media36. Here, analogues 17 and 24 were observed to
dissipate the membrane potential of MRSA (ATCC 43300) to a
similar or greater degree than the control antibiotic oritavancin
537, 38, as measured by the fluorescence output of diSC3(5)
(Fig. 7c). All compounds were dosed at 16 µg mL−1, equating to a
concentration approximately 16-fold above their MIC for 5, 17
and 24 (Note that membrane permeabilisation studies were
conducted in polystyrene plates without polysorbate-80 additive
to avoid assay interferences; under these conditions the MIC for
5, 17 and 24 = 1–2 µg mL−1—Supplementary Table 12). The
effect was less pronounced for compound 19 despite a higher
MIC-fold exposure (~128-fold MIC), whereas vancomycin,
daptomycin and dalbavancin showed no effect under the
conditions of the assay. Similar effects were observed against
MSSA (ATCC 29213) (Supplementary Fig. 13).
Additional evidence for membrane perturbation was obtained
with the membrane impermeable dye propidium iodide (PI),
which stains nuclear chromatin upon cell membrane disruption,
resulting in fluorescence enhancement39. To this end, MRSA
(ATCC 43300) was incubated with selected antibiotic compounds
at 16 µg mL−1 for 1 h (~16-fold MIC for compounds 17, 24,
oritavancin, dalbavancin and vancomycin in polystyrene plates)
followed by exposure to propidium iodide (Fig. 7d). Again,
compounds 17 and 24 elicited a response with comparable
fluorescence intensity to oritavancin37, 38. Daptomycin40 caused
approximately 4–6-fold higher fluorescence than oritavancin or
17. In contrast, compound 19, vancomycin and dalbavancin
showed little to no effect in this membrane permeabilisation
assay. A similar trend was observed against MSSA (ATCC 29213)
(Supplementary Fig. 14).
Discussion
Whilst there is a current perception that Gram-positive anti-
biotics are less urgently required than Gram-negative therapies, in
reality the number of drug-resistant Gram-positive infections,
and resulting deaths, far outnumber those from resistant Gram-
negative bacteria1. Over the past four decades the rational
improvement of existing classes of antibiotics has proven to be a
very successful strategy. Vancomycin is a logical candidate for
improvement via specific membrane-targeting, given its mode of
action and the length of time it took (more than 20 years) for
significant clinical resistance to arise.
Membrane-ligand interactions are an underexplored area of
drug design. We created a series of membrane-targeted vanco-
mycin derivatives with significantly improved activity against a
range of Gram-positive bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant
strains. The modular nature of their structure (Fig. 1), with a
lipophilic group (MIE) designed to insert in the membrane, a
positively charged peptide (EEPS) for electrostatic interaction
with the overall negative surface charge of bacterial membranes,
and a linker for attachment to the C-terminal carboxyl group of
vancomycin, provided a platform to readily produce multiple
derivatives using solid phase peptide synthesis. A series of
structure-activity relationship studies resulted in promising
compounds with potent in vitro activity, often more than 100-
fold more active than vancomycin (Tables 1 and 3). Both MIE
and EEPS components were required for enhanced activity.

demonstrated excellent in vivo activity in multiple murine models
of infection at doses up to 40-fold lower than vancomycin (Fig. 5),
with a pharmacokinetic (PK) profile consistent with once daily
dosing in humans (Fig. 4). Induced resistance experiments
demonstrated that the compounds retained a low propensity to
cause resistance, in contrast to daptomycin (Fig. 3).
The remarkably potent activity possessed by these antibiotics is
most likely due to a membrane anchoring chelate effect that
enhances antibiotic binding to cell wall precursors at the cell
surface. In effect, intra-molecular binding is achieved as both the
antibiotic and its target are attached via membrane anchors to the
same template. Examining peptidoglycan synthesis in a cell-free
system demonstrated that the vancapticins caused greater inhi-
bition of biosynthetic activity than vancomycin, corresponding
with much greater quantities of Ac-Lys(Ac)-D-Ala-D-Ala ligand in
free solution required to antagonise vancapticin antimicrobial
activity against live bacteria (Fig. 6).
The enhanced ability to inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis is
accompanied by membrane binding and disruption (Fig. 7). SPR
studies demonstrated a greater propensity for binding to an
anionic lipid bilayer compared to vancomycin. A diSC3(5) dye-
based assay in live bacteria showed that vancapticins induced
membrane depolarisation to a similar extent to that seen with
oritavancin, with minimal activity observed with vancomycin or
dalbavancin. In contrast, a membrane permeabilisation assay
(propidium iodide dye) gave variable results for the same van-
capticins, with 17 and 24 eliciting a comparable response as
oritavancin, but fourfold to sixfold less than daptomycin. Van-
capticin 19 and dalbavancin were much less active, while van-
comycin had no effect. The increased membrane activity of the
vancapticins appears to enhance their potency, but does not
translate into increased killing kinetics: compound 24 shared a
similar slowly bactericidal profile with vancomycin (Fig. 2).
In summary, we report the design and development of pro-
mising new semisynthetic lipoglycopeptides intended to selec-
tively interact with bacterial membranes. Further improvements
and additional studies are ongoing to assess the potential to
advance the vancapticins as a new clinical candidate for the
treatment of drug-resistant Gram-positive infections.
Methods
Ethics approvals. Research was conducted under an Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee approved protocol in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act,
PHS Policy and other federal statutes and regulations relating to animals and
experiments involving animals. Contract facilities where animal studies were
conducted were accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care, International and adhere to principles stated in the Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, National Research Council, 2011.
Studies performed at the University of Queensland were approved by the Mole-
cular Biosciences Animal Ethics Committee. Sample size for in vivo studies was
selected based on minimising animal use while providing sufficient data points to
show significant differences based on historical studies. No animals were excluded
from analysis. No documented method of randomisation was employed, with
animals randomly assigned to groups. Code numbers were employed for all in vivo
studies, so the study investigator was blinded to the actual identity of compounds.
Human ethics approval from the University of Queensland Medical Research
Ethics Committee was obtained for use of human blood for haemolysis studies.
Chemical synthesis. General: C-terminal amide or methyl amide containing
peptides were assembled on Fmoc-Rink Amide AM polystyrene resin (Iris Biotech
GmbH) or HypoGel hydroxymethylbenzoic acid (HMBA) resin (Iris Biotech
GmbH), respectively. Peptides bearing free C-terminal carboxylic acids were
assembled on Fmoc-Cys(Trt) or Fmoc-Lys(Boc) Wang polystyrene resin. 9-
Fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-L-amino acids utilised standard side-chain
protecting groups: tert-Butyl (Asp, Ser), Trityl (Cys), tert-Butoxycarbony (Boc) or
4-methyltrityl (Mtt) or 1-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohexylidene)-3-methylbutyl
(ivDde) (Lys, Dab, Dap, Orn) and were purchased from Iris Biotech GmbH, as
were the coupling reagents O-(benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N’,N’-tetramethyluronium

 tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) was sourced from GenScript
Corporation (USA), and (S)-pyridylthio cysteamine.HCl from Toronto Research
Chemicals Inc. Vancomycin.HCl 1 was purchased from Hallochem Pharma Co.
Ltd, daptomycin 4 from Molekula (Cat # 64342447) and oritavancin diphosphate 5
(Cat # 317101), and dalbavancin.HCl 3 (Cat # 317136) from MedKoo Biosciences.
Dalbavancin 3 was also synthesised internally, as was telavancin 2. Analytical liquid
chromatography / mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was performed using reverse-phase
high-performance liquid chromatograph (RP-HPLC) on an Eclipse XDB-Phenyl
column (5 µm, 4.6 × 150 mm, 1 mL min−1) coupled to an Agilent 1200 series sys-
tem with detection by a single quadrupole mass spectrometer (6110), a UV detector
operating at 210 nm and an evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD). Pre-
parative HPLC was performed using reverse-phase HPLC on an Eclipse XDB-
Phenyl column (5 µm, 21.2 × 100 mm, 20 mL min−1) coupled to an Agilent 1260
Infinity system with detection by UV (210 nm). Elution was effected using
appropriate gradients with 0.05% formic acid (analytical) or 0.1% trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) (preparative) in water (solvent A) and 0.05% formic acid (analytical) or
0.1% TFA (preparative) in acetonitrile (solvent B). (+)-electrospray ionisation mass
spectrometry/mass spectrometry (ESI–MS/MS) were obtained using an API
QSTAR™ Pulsar Hybrid LC-MS/MS System using the following conditions: col-
umn oven 40 °C, MS parameters: CUR: 20, IS: 5300, TEM: 450, GS1: 45, GS2: 45,
ihe: ON, DP 60. HPLC Column: Waters Atlantis® T3 5 µm 2.1 × 50 mm with
Atlantis® T3 5 µm 2.1 × 10 mm guard column. Flow rates and solvent: 0.4 mL min
−1, solvent A: 0.1% formic acid in H2O, solvent B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile;
isocratic 0% B from 0→1 min, gradient 0%→100% B from 2→9 min, isocratic 100%
from 5→12 min, gradient 100%→0% B from 12→12.5 min and isocratic 2% B from
12.5→17.5 min. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was performed on a
Bruker Micro time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer using (+)-ESI calibrated to
NH4OAc.1H (600 MHz), 13C (150 MHz) and 2D NMR spectra were obtained in
d6-dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) calibrated to TMS resonances (δH 0.00, δC 0.0)
using a Bruker Avance-600 spectrometer equipped with a TXI cryoprobe.
General procedure A: Loading of Fmoc-L-Lys(ivDde)-OH or Fmoc-L-Orn
(ivDde)-OH onto hypogel HMBA resin. HypoGel HMBA resin was washed with
anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) (3×) under an inert atmosphere. A mixture
of Fmoc-L-Lys(ivDde)-OH or Fmoc-L-Orn(ivDde)-OH (5 eq), hydro-
xybenzotriazole (5 eq) in anhydrous DMF (2.5 mL per 1 mmol amino acid) was
treated with 1,3-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) (5 eq) and 4-
dimethylaminopyridine (0.3 eq). The resulting solution was added to the resin and
the resin was shaken at room temperature overnight. The resin was drained, and
successively washed with DMF, methanol (MeOH) and dichloromethane (DCM)
(3 × each). A solution of acetic anhydride (4 eq) and diisopropylethylamine
(DIPEA) (8 eq) in DMF (~10 mL per 1 gram of resin) was added to the resin to
block any unreacted sites. After shaking for 1 h, the resin was drained and washed
with DMF, MeOH and DCM (3 × each) and dried in vacuo.
General procedure B: Standard Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis. The
starting resin was washed with anhydrous DMF (3 × ). Fmoc-deprotection was
performed by shaking the resin with piperidine in DMF (20:80 v/v, 10 mL per 1 g of
resin) for 30 min. The resin was drained and washed successively with DMF,
MeOH, DCM and DMF (3 × each). A solution of Fmoc-protected amino acid or
fatty acid (4 equiv) in DMF (~0.4 M) was treated with HBTU (4 equiv) and DIPEA
(16 equiv). After 10 min, the activated amino acid solution was added to the resin.
The resin was agitated at room temperature (RT) for 1 h, drained, washed suc-
cessively with DMF, MeOH and DCM (3 × each), and dried in vacuo. Coupling
efficiency was assessed using the Kaiser test and/or by cleavage of 2–3 mg of resin
and analysis by LCMS. If required, the coupling reaction was repeated.
General procedure C: Removal of the ivDde protecting group. Crude lipo-
peptide was treated with an excess of hydrazine hydrate (2% v/v in DMF, ca. 10 eq)
at RT. Reaction progress was monitored by LC/MS. Upon completion, the solution
was concentrated in vacuo and the resulting crude product was lyophilised (ACN/
H2O). The material was then used in the next step without further purification
(intermediate) or purified by preparative HPLC (final product).
General procedure D: Removal of the 4-methyltrityl (Mtt) group. The Mtt-
protected vancomycin derivative was treated with a solution of TFA/triethylsilane
(TES)/DCM (2:5:93, 40 mL per 1 g of crude peptide) at room temperature for 1 h
and concentrated under reduced pressure. The process was repeated if deprotection
was incomplete as determined by LCMS analysis. Upon completion, the solution
was concentrated in vacuo and the crude product was purified by preparative
HPLC.
General procedure E: Resin cleavage. (i) Rink-amide, Wang- and 2-CTC-resins.
Peptides incorporating cysteine were cleaved from the resin by agitation with TFA/
1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT)/triisopropylsilane (TIPS)/water (90/5/2.5/2.5 v/v/v/v, 20
mL per 1 g of resin). Non-cysteine containing peptides were cleaved from the resin
by agitation with TFA/TIPS/water (95:2.5:2.5 v/v/v, 20 mL per 1 g of resin). Resins
were filtered and washed with TFA (3×). The combined filtrates were concentrated
in vacuo and the crude peptides were precipitated with cold diethyl ether, isolated
by centrifugation and lyophilised (ACN/H2O). (ii) HMBA hypogel resin: C-
terminal N-methyl amides. Prior to cleavage, the resin was washed with tetra-
hydrofuran (THF) (3×) and DIPEA (2×) and then treated with methylamine (2 M
in THF, 20 mL per 1 g of resin) with overnight agitation at RT. The resin was
drained, and washed with THF, DCM and ACN (3× each). The combined filtrates
were removed under reduced pressure to afford crude product.
eneral procedure F: Disulphide exchange. GPeptides incorporating cysteine were
dissolved in acetonitrile/water (1:1, ca. 150 mL per 1 mmol of substrate), and the
pH was adjusted (pH 8–9) by addition of DIPEA (ca. 5 eq). A solution of 43 (1.5
equiv) in acetonitrile/water (1:1, ca. 100 mL per 1 mmol of 43) was added. After
standing at room temperature for 1 h, the reaction mixture was concentrated by
lyophilisation, and the resulting crude product was purified by preparative RP-
HPLC.
General procedure G: Solution phase coupling with vancomycin. A stirred
solution of peptide (1 eq), O-(7-Azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N’,N’-tetra-
methyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) (1.3 eq) and vancomycin hydro-
chloride (1.2 eq) in anhydrous DMF (~ 30 mL per 1 mmol of peptide) was cooled
to 0 °C. After 30 min, DIPEA was added (10 eq), and stirring was continued for 1 h
at room temperature. The solvent was evaporated in vacuo and the residue was
lyophilised from ACN/H2O. The crude product was purified by preparative RP-
HPLC.
Structure elucidation of synthesised compounds. Compound purity was
determined using LC-(+)-ESI-MS/UV/ELSD and their molecular formulae deter-
mined by (+)-HR-ESI-MS. (+)-ESI-TOF-MS/MS analysis was also undertaken and
representative examples of fragmentation are given in Supplementary Fig. 10. The
major MS/MS fragment of all compounds was m/z 144, which corresponded to the
loss of the vancosamine. This and other fragments showed that the two sugars,
vancosamine and glucose, remained intact throughout the reaction sequence.
Sequential losses of the MIE and EEPS fragments could also be observed in the MS/
MS spectra. 1H, 13C and 2D (COSY, TOCSY, HSQC, HMBC and HSQC-TOCSY)
NMR experiments were used to confirm the structure of 19 (Supplementary
Table 1).
Synthesis of 2-[(2-Pyridinyl)dithio]ethanamino-vancomycin (43): To a solu-
tion of vancomycin hydrochloride 1 (6.89 g, 4.64 mmol, 1.2 equiv) in dry dime-
thylsulphoxide (DMSO) (68 mL, 69 mM) was added a solution of (S)-pyridylthio
cysteamine hydrochloride (PDEA, 998 mg, 3.87 mmol) in dry DMF (68 mL, 56.9
mM). PyBOP (2.82 g, 5.42 mmol, 1.4 equiv) in dry DMF (10.8 mL, 0.5 M) was
added followed by DIPEA (3.37 mL, 19.3 mmol, 5 equiv). The resulting solution
was stirred at room temperature overnight and the solvent was removed under
reduced pressure. The crude product was precipitated with diethyl ether and col-
lected by vacuum filtration as a white solid, 10.8 g. The crude product was used for
the disulphide exchange reaction without further purification. A small amount of
crude product (100 mg) was purified by HPLC to give 43 as white solid (TFA salt),
47 mg, 71% yield. HPLC purity > 95%, tR 6.4. (ES) m/z (MH22+) 808.7, (MH33+)

Determination of antimicrobial activity. Antimicrobial activity of compounds
was tested against a number of bacterial strains by broth microdilution (BMD)
assay with MIC determination, including S. aureus (MSSA ATCC® 29213™, MRSA
ATCC® 43300™, VISA NARSA NRS1, VISA NARSA NRS4), Streptococcus pneu-
moniae (MDR ATCC® 700677™) and Enterococcus faecium (MDR VanA ATCC®
51559™). ATCC strains were sourced from the American Type Culture Collection
and NRS strains from NARSA (Network on Antimicrobial Resistance in S. aureus)
via BEI Resources (www.beiresources.org). All compounds were prepared to 160
µg mL−1 solution in water from a stock solution of 1 mM concentration.
MIC assay. The compounds, along with standard antibiotics were serially diluted
twofold across the wells of 96-well non-binding surface (NBS) polystyrene plates
(Corning 3641). (Note: We have found that MIC determinations in NBS plates give
identical results to untreated polystyrene plates for most antibiotics (e.g. vanco-
mycin, daptomycin, β-lactams, oxazolidinones), but for lipoglycopeptide antibiotics
(dalbavancin, oritavancin and our vancapticins) where Clinical & Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines recommend addition of 0.002% polysorbate
80 for MIC determination, values obtained in NBS plates with no additive match
those obtained in untreated polystyrene plates with addition of 0.002% polysorbate
80—Supplementary Table 12). Standards ranged from 64 to 0.03 µg mL−1 and
compounds from 8 to 0.003 µg mL−1 with final assay volumes of 100 µL per well.
Gram-positive bacteria were cultured in Mueller Hinton broth (MHB) (Bactola-
boratories, Cat. no. 211443) at 37 °C overnight. A sample of each culture was then
diluted 40-fold in fresh MHB and incubated at 37 °C for 2–3 h. The resultant mid-
log phase cultures were added to the compound-containing 96-well plates to give a
final cell density of 5 × 105 colony forming unit (CFU) mL−1. All the plates were
covered and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. MICs were the lowest concentration
showing no visible growth.
Serum reversal MIC assay. The compounds, along with standard antibiotics,
tested in BMD-MIC assay as above, in the presence of a mixture of 50% human
serum (Sigma-Aldrich) and 50% MHB.
Surfactant reversal MIC assay. The compounds, along with standard antibiotics,
were tested in BMD-MIC assay as above, in the presence of 1 and 5% Survanta
(beractant) suspension (Abbott Australasia Cat # 1039.008; 25 mg mL−1) in MHB.

 Lipid II ligand antagonism assay. All compounds were dissolved in H2O. Bacillus
subtilis ATCC® 6633™ NRS-231 was cultured in MHB at 37 °C for 48 h. A sample of
each culture was then diluted 40-fold in fresh MHB and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h.
Compounds were added to each row of 96-well NBS plates (NBS, Corning 3641), in
duplicate. The tripeptide N,N΄-diacetyl-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala was serially diluted
twofold across the compound-containing wells from 6400 to 3 µg mL−1. To this the
resultant mid-log phase cultures were diluted to the final concentration of 5 × 105
CFU mL−1, then added to wells of the compound-containing plates. All the plates
were covered and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The molar excess was determined as
the ratio of [ligand]/[antibiotic] in the well containing the lowest ligand con-
centration that completely suppressed inhibition after 24 h incubation.
Time kill assay. S. aureus ATCC® 43300™ (MRSA) was cultured in MHB (Bac-
toLaboratories, Cat. No 211443) at 37 °C overnight. A sample was then diluted 40-
fold in fresh MHB and incubated at 37 °C for 2–3 h until the culture reached early
exponential phase (OD600 of 0.2–0.4). Vancapticin 24 (1, 0.25, 0.015 and 0.003 µg
mL−1) and vancomycin (4, 2, 1 and 0.5 µg mL−1) were serially diluted twofold
across the wells of 96-well microtitre plates (NBS, Corning 3641) with a final
volume of 50 µL, then combined with 50 µL of bacterial inoculum (giving a final
cell density of 5 × 105 CFU mL−1) and incubated at 37 °C. Serial dilutions of the
cultures were plated at each desired time point, using a multichannel pipette as
follows: in row A of a 96-well plate, 50 µL of sterile activated charcoal suspension
(25 mg mL−1) was added, while 90 µL of 0.9% sterile saline per well was added to
the other rows. At selected time-points, 50 µL aliquots were transferred from the
time-kill assay plate to the first row containing the charcoal suspension and mixed
well. The wells were further diluted 1 in 10 (0.9% saline) for the appropriate
number of dilutions and 10 μL of each dilution was spotted in duplicate onto Luria-
Bertani (LB) agar, then incubated overnight at 37 °C. The colonies in each spot
were counted and used to calculate the number of viable CFU mL−1 remaining in
the original culture by considering the dilution factors (1:2 in charcoal, the serial
dilution factor and the volume of the aliquot spotted).
Resistance frequency assay. The resistance frequency for Compound 19 was
determined following literature procedures41, 42.
Compound preparation: Compound 19 was prepared to 160 µg mL−1 solution in
water from the given stock solution of 1 mM concentration. Vancomycin was
prepared to 1.28 mg mL−1 solution in water.
Antibacterial plate preparation: Tryptic soy broth (TSB) with 1% agarose and
0.002% Tween 80 was maintained at 45 to 50 °C in a water bath. 160 mL of agarose
was transferred to 200 mL glass bottle, maintaining the remaining agarose in the
water bath. The appropriate amount of compound (calculated to give a final
concentration 16-fold or 8-fold over MIC) was added to the 160 mL agarose sample
[A]. A volume of 80 mL of agarose sample [A] was plated in four petri plates
(duplicates/condition—neat, 10−1) with swirling to ensure that the bottom of the
plate was coated equally. An additional 80 mL of fresh agarose was added to the
remaining 80 mL of agarose [A] sample to achieve a twofold dilution to provide
agarose sample [B]. Once again, 80 mL of agarose sample [B] was plated in four
petri plates. This procedure was repeated until a range of concentrations of the
antibacterial compound above the expected MIC was obtained. This method was
done individually for every antibacterial compound under study. Agarose plate
MIC values used for this study were determined to be 1 µg mL−1 for vancomycin
and 0.06 µg mL−1 for compound 19.
Plate culture for titre of 18 h stationary phase and resistance frequency:
Bacteria were subcultured at 37 °C overnight with shaking at 220 rpm. The bacterial
culture was serially diluted in MHB to achieve a 10−1 to 10−8 dilution series. The
three last dilutions (10−6, 10−7 and 10−8) were used to determine the titre of the
culture. An aliquot of 100 µL (10 µL in some cases) of these three dilutions were
added to compound-free agar petri plates. This was done in duplicate and the plates
were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Resultant separated visible colonies were
counted; those colonies that grow together were not included to determine the titre
of the culture. An aliquot of 100 µL of the neat (undiluted) stationary-phase culture
and 10−1 dilution was plated separately onto the agar plate containing each con-
centration of antibacterial compound. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C.
Detection and analysis: The colonies were counted after 24 h. The resistance
frequency is determined by dividing the number of colonies obtained on the plates
containing the antibacterial agent by the number of cells plated.
Resistance induction assay. A resistance induction assay was conducted for
vancomycin, daptomycin, compound 17 and compound 2443.
S. aureus ATCC®43300™ was grown in Mueller Hinton broth supplemented with
50 µg mL−1 of CaCl2. The bacterial culture was incubated at 37 °C in a shaker at
195 rpm.
Viability testing: The mid log S. aureus growth culture was serially diluted and
plated on a solid LB agar plates in quadruplicates and incubated at 37 °C overnight
to determine viable colony count.
Antimicrobial broth microdilution MICs and plate preparation: The initial
determination of the compound MICs were taken from the literature and
empirically measured. Doubling MIC dilutions were prepared in Cation-adjusted
Mueller-Hinton broth (Ca-MHB) in NBS 96-well plates (NBS, Corning 3641) with
columns 11 and 12 allocated for bacterial culture without the antimicrobial and Ca-
MHB media. The starting MIC ranges were 20 µg mL−1 to 0.08 µg mL−1 for dap-
tomycin, 32 µg mL−1 to 0.06 µg mL−1 for vancomycin and 0.5 µg mL−1 to 0.001 µg
mL−1 for both vancapticins with 100 µL of the dilutions added to the plate. MRSA
culture in mid log growth with 0.6 optical density at 600 nm (OD600) was diluted to
an equivalence of 105 CFU mL−1 and 100 µL was added to the antimicrobial
containing plate. The plate was then incubated at 37 °C overnight.
Daily antimicrobial MIC plate preparation: After overnight incubation, the
growth of the S. aureus (MRSA) culture was determined by reading at OD600 on
the Epoch microplate spectrophotometer and 0.1 OD600 was the chosen cut-off
determining growth vs. no growth. The sample selection of S. aureus and pre-
paration was carried out as previously described43 with 10 µL of the sub-lethal MIC
S. aureus cultures (i.e. the maximum antibiotic concentration with OD600 ≥ 0.1)
diluted in 10 mL of Ca-MHB for the following day’s MIC plate. Doubling dilutions
were supplemented with intermediate MICs to reduce the MIC difference and
provide a ladder for non-susceptible isolates for the 20 day period with an average
overnight incubation of 19 h at 37 °C. The non-susceptible isolates were grown
overnight at 37 °C with shaking before being preserved in 20% glycerol and as a
pellet (stored frozen at −80 °C).
Cytotoxicity assay. Compound cytotoxicity was evaluated against HepG2 (ATCC-
®HB-8065 liver hepatoceullular carcinoma) and HEK293 (ATCC®CRL-1573,
embryonic kidney) human cell lines using standard (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)
−2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay protocol with slight changes. In
brief, HepG2 and HEK293 cells (assessed annually for mycoplasma contamination)
were seeded as 1.5 × 104 cells per well in a clear 96-well tissue culture treated plate
in a final volume of 100 μL in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)
(GIBCO-Invitrogen #11995-073), in which 1% of FBS was added. Cells were
incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 to allow cells to attach to the plates. Com-
pounds prepared at 100 µM to 0.046 µM in threefold dilutions were added into each
well and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After the incubation, 0.4 mg mL−1 MTT
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)−2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (Invitrogen) was
added to each well. The plates were then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The
media was removed, and purple formazan crystals were resuspended in 60 μL of
DMSO. The absorbance was read at 570 nm using a Polarstar Omega plate reader.
The data was then analysed by Prism software. Results are presented as the average
percentage of control ± S.D. for each set of duplicate wells using the following
equation: percent viability = (ABSTEST – ABSPOSITIVE CTRL / ABSUNTREATED –ABS
POSITIVE CTRL)×100.
Haemolysis assay. Haemolytic activity was measured as previously described with
slight modifications44, 45. Fresh human venal blood was collected from healthy
volunteers and pretreated with the anticoagulant sodium citrate. Serial twofold
dilutions of each antibiotic, dissolved in 0.9% NaCl solution, were added to fresh
human whole blood (50% final, vol:vol) to the final volume of 80 μL and incubated
at 37 °C for 3 h on a horizontal shaker at 200 rpm. For negative and positive
controls, human whole blood in 0.9% NaCl solution (Ablank) and in sdH2O (Awater)
were used, respectively. After incubation, both test and Ablank were mixed with 1
mL 0.9% NaCl solution, or sdH2O for the complete hydrolysis Awater. After cen-
trifugation of samples at 2500 rpm (700 × g) for 5 min, the release of haemoglobin
was monitored by measuring the absorbance (Asample) of the supernatant at 540 nm
using BMG Labtech PolarStar Omega multimode reader. The percentage of hae-
molysis was calculated according to the equation:

Critical micelle concentration assay. CMCs were determined as previously
described46 with a higher throughput modification. Briefly, a cascade dilution of
each antibiotic was performed in a low binding polypropylene V-bottom shaped
96-well plates in the presence of 0.2 M NaCl solution across 12 concentrations
ranging from 1000 to 0.1 μM, except the control melittin (100 to 0.01 μM). An
identical cascade dilution was performed for the neutral detergent Triton X-100
and the anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) starting from 0.1% down
to 0.00001% (vol:vol for Triton X-100 and wt:vol for SDS). An aliquot of 6-
diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) in DMSO was added in each well to yield the
final DPH concentration of 5 μM. The reaction mixtures were mixed for 30 s and
transferred in horizontal triplicate (25 μL per well) into a black falcon 384-well
plate. The 384-well plate was then sealed, wrapped up in aluminium foil and
incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The fluorescence intensity was

 monitored in real time using a BMG Labtech PolarStar Omega multimode reader
fitted with 360-10 and 430-10 excitation and emission filters respectively, at an
excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 430 nm.
Membrane depolarisation assay. Antibiotic-induced bacterial cytoplasmic
membrane depolarisation was determined using the fluorescent dye 3,3-dipro-
pylthiacarbocyanine diSC3(5) (Sigma Aldrich, Australia) as previously described37.
Briefly, early exponential phase cells were pelleted and washed twice in 10 mM
HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 50 µg mL−1 of CaCl2 and 5 mM Glucose, and
then re-suspended in the same buffer (2 × 108 CFU mL−1). diSC3(5) was added to a
final concentration of 1.5 µM and incubated at room temperature in the dark to
enable dye uptake and fluorescence quenching. After 30 min, cells were diluted 50-
fold in assay buffer and 45 µL of cells were added to a 384-well black walled
polystyrene plate (Corning, CLS3573) (Note: NBS plates were not employed, and
no polysorbate-80 was added to avoid potential effects on membrane permeability,
or interference with fluorescence as previously reported37. The MICs of com-
pounds in polystyrene plates are listed in Supplementary Table 12). Background
data was collected before adding compounds using a Tecan Infinite® m1000 Pro
Multi-mode reader (excitation/emission 612/665 nm) to ensure fluorescence
quenching. Compounds were added to a final concentration of 16 µg mL−1 and
fluorescence was monitored for 30 min. Data were corrected by subtraction of
background response (diSC3(5) in the presence of untreated cells, no compound).
Note that the MIC values for oritavancin and compound 17 increase to 1 µg mL−1,
and compound 24 to 2 µg mL−1, in polystyrene plates. Each sample was tested in
quadruplicate and independent assays were performed twice showing similar
results. Data were analysed and presented using Prism software.
Membrane permeability assay. To evaluate the ability of the compounds to
disrupt the cytoplasmic membrane integrity, the membrane impermeable fluor-
escent DNA intercalating dye propidium iodide (PI) was used. Early exponential
phase cells were pelleted and washed twice in 10 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4)
containing 50 µg mL−1 of CaCl2 and 5 mM glucose, and then re-suspended in the
same buffer (4 × 108 CFU mL−1). Cell suspension was added to a 384-well black
walled polystyrene plate (Corning, CLS3573) containing compounds, giving a final
concentration of 16 µg mL−1. After 1 h incubation at 37 °C, 5 µg mL−1 of PI was
added and fluorescence was monitored for 90 min using a Tecan Infinite® m1000
Pro Multi-mode reader (excitation/emission 535/620 nm). Data were corrected by
subtraction of fluorescence signal arising from untreated cells in the presence of PI.
Note that the MIC values for oritavancin and compound 17 increase to 1 µg mL−1,
and compound 24 to 2 µg mL−1, in polystyrene plates. Each sample was tested in
quadruplicate and independent assays were performed twice showing similar
results. Data was analysed and presented using Prism software.
ITC for assessment of ligand binding and dimerisation. Calorimetric experi-
ments were performed on a MicroCal Omega Auto-iTC200 Isothermal Titration
Calorimeter (GE Healthcare, Australia), at 298 K, with a 10 μcal s−1 reference
power and stirring speed of 1000 rpm. All samples were prepared in 0.1 M NaOAc,
pH 5.0 buffer. Each experiment consisted of sequential injections into the calori-
meter cell (0.2 mL) with 240 s equilibration intervals. Corrections of small heat
effects from separate blank titrations were made prior to analysis. Data were
processed using the MicroCal Origin 7.0 software package provided with the
instrument to fit a single site binding model or dissociation model to estimate the
association constant (Ka), enthalpy (ΔH), entropy (ΔS) and stoichiometry (N). The
Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) was calculated using the Gibbs–Helmholz ther-
modynamic equation, (1):
ΔG ¼ �RTlnK
ð1Þ
Where R is the ideal gas constant (8.31 J mol−1 K−1) and T is the temperature in
Kelvin.
Single site binding: Ligand binding experiments consisted of 12 sequential
injections (2 µL per injection, first injection of 0.5 µL) of ligand (400 µM, con-
centration 14-fold to 20-fold higher than the antibiotic concentration) into the
calorimeter cell containing the antibiotic (monomer solution 25 µM for vanco-
mycin and 40 µM for vancapticins). Antibiotic concentration was selected to avoid
self-dimerisation.
Dimer–monomer dissociation: Dissociation experiments involved 13 sequential
injections (3 µL per injection, first injection of 0.5 µL) of concentrated (3.0 mM)
antibiotic solutions titrated to buffer only. Dissociation experiments involving
ligand maintained a constant concentration of excess ligand (9.0 mM) dissolved in
buffer in both the calorimeter cell and titration syringe to ensure that antibiotic
molecules were predominantly in their ligand-complexed form.
SPR membrane binding assay. SPR experiments were performed using a BIAcore
3000 (GE Health) instrument with a Biacore vesicle capture L1 sensor chip. DMPC
(1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and DMPG (1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-
glycero-3-phosphoglycerol) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Small uni-
lamellar vesicles (SUV) were prepared in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4)
by sonication and extrusion. In brief, lipids were dissolved in chloroform in 25 mL
round-bottom flasks, and then deposited as a thin film by removal of the solvent
(chloroform) under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator and dried under high
vacuum for at least 2 h. PBS was then added into each flask to give a suspension,
which was sonicated for 5 cycles of 5 min each. The suspension was passed 17 ×
through a 50-nm polycarbonate filter in an Avestin Lipofast Basic extrusion
apparatus to give a translucent solution of vesicles, which should possess a mean
diameter of 50 nm. The SUVs were injected across the L1 sensor chip for 30 min at
a flow rate of 2 mL min−1 to form a supported lipid bilayer. The coverage of the
lipid bilayer was determined from the extent of non-specific binding of bovine
serum albumin (0.1 mg mL−1 in PBS, 5 min injection). A series of concentrations of
vancomycin and vancapticins were passed sequentially over the different
phospholipid-containing flow cells at a flow rate of 30 µL min−1 for 180 s. The
amount of antibiotic bound at equilibrium just before the end of the injection was
corrected by subtraction of the bulk-refractive index difference observed at the
beginning and the end of each injection. After each injection cycle, the lipid surface
was regenerated with 20 mM 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]−1-pro-
panesulfonate (CHAPS) and a fresh lipid bilayer was loaded as described above. All
assays were carried out at 25 °C in triplicate. The equilibrium binding response
values obtained were normalised by dividing the average observed response (RU)
by the molecular weights (MW) of each compound, i.e. RUadjusted = 100 × RU/MW.
Peptidoglycan inhibition assay. The cell-free particulate fraction of Bacillus
megaterium KM (ATCC®13632™) was used to catalyse the polymerisation of
peptidoglycan from UPD-linked precursors in vitro following literature proce-
dures47. B. megaterium was grown in the medium containing 1% (w/v) tryptone
(Difco-Bacto), 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract (Difco-Bacto), 0.25% (w/v) K2HPO4 and
0.5% (w/v) glucose with pH 7.2. Bacteria were harvested when the density had
reached to 0.4 mg dry weight mL−1 and washed in the buffer 0.05 M Tris-HCl
(pH 7.8) containing 10 mM MgCl2 by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C.
All subsequent manipulations were carried out on ice. The bacteria were
resuspended in the same buffer at a density of 50 mg dry weight mL−1, and then
subjected to three freeze/thaw cycles. Bacteria were then homogenised by using a
glass homogeniser at 4 °C (2 × 10 min). The broken cell suspension was centrifuged
at 6000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (Supernatant 1) which contained
the unbroken cells and the majority of the cell walls was collected. The pellet was
resuspended in the same buffer and re-centrifuged at 6000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C,
and the supernatant (Supernatant 2) was collected. The two supernatants
(Supernatant 1 and Supernatant 2) were combined and centrifuged at 20,500 rpm
(38,000 × g) for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet, consisting mainly of membrane fragments
together with some cell wall material, was washed once with the same buffer and
finally resuspended in 0.05 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 10 mM MgCl2. In vitro
peptidoglycan synthesis was performed by mixing the following contents in a final
volume of 20 µL: 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 10 mM MgCl2, B. megaterium
membrane faction (around 40 to 50 µg protein), 0.4 mM uridine 5’-diphospho
N-acetyl muramoyl-L-alanyl-D-γ-glutamyl-L-lysyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine (UDP-Mur-
NAc-pentapeptide, The University of Warwick, UK), 6.5 µM [14C]UDP-N-acet-
ylglucosamine (UDP-[14C]GlcNAc, American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc, 25 µci,
11.1 GBq mmol−1, 0.1 mci mL−1) and vancapticins at final concentrations of 0,
0.03, 0.1, 1, 3 and 10 µg mL−1. The reaction mixtures were incubated at RT for 3 h
and placed in a boiling water bath for 3 min to inactivate the enzymes. 5 µL of each
sample was separated using TLC on silica gel plates (TLC Silica gel 60 F254, 20 × 20
cm, Merck KGaA, Germany) for 2 h in isobutyric acid /1 M NH4OH (5/3, v/v).
The TLC plates were then dried and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen
(GE Healthcare, Australia) for 1 week and scanned using a Typhoon 8600
(GE Healthcare, Australia). Integrated density value (IDV) of each band on silica
gel was analysed using AlphaEase FC software (AlphaImager 2200). The change of
peptidoglycan or Lipid II were calculated as percent from the IDV values of the
control (without any antibiotic or compound).
Human plasma stability assay. Compound stability in human plasma was
performed as previously reported48, with modifications. Briefly, test compounds
(20 μM) were prepared from a 0.2 mM H2O stock solution (40 μL in 400 μL assay
volume) except eucatropine, which was 300 μg mL−1 in 100% DMSO (10 μL in 400
μL assay volume equivalent to 23 μM). The precipitating solution was prepared by
adding 5 μL of 10 mM carbutamide in DMSO to 100 mL acetonitrile (final con-
centration: 135.5 ng mL−1 or 0.5 μM carbutamide). The human plasma sample
(pooled normal human plasma sodium heparin anticoagulant, 2 µL, Cat No.:
HMPLNAHP, BioReclamation) and phosphate-buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.4 isotonic)
were pre-heated at 37 °C for 30 min. 40 μL of test compounds (0.2 mM) were added
to protein-low binding Eppendorf tubes, 160 μL of buffer was added, and the
mixture was vortexed. For eucatropine, 10 μL of eucatropine (300 μg mL−1) was
added to a protein-low binding Eppendorf tube, 190 μL of buffer was added, and
the mixture was vortexed. In each case, 200 μL of plasma was added and the
resultant mixture vortexed. For the initial time point (reaction time t = 0 h), 50 μL
of sample was immediately transferred into a protein-low binding Eppendorf tube
and quenched with 150 μL of the ice-cold precipitating solution, followed by

 vortexing and subsequent storage at 4 °C. For the remaining time points, the
plasma solution was incubated and shaken (150 rpm) at 37 °C. 50 μL aliquots were
collected at time points of 0, 1, 3, 6 and 24 h and quenched with 150 μL the ice-cold
precipitating solution. All samples were placed in a 4 °C fridge for 30 min then
centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 8 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (100 μL) was trans-
ferred to a glass vial insert and stored at 4 °C until LC-MS/MS analysis. The
percentage of test compounds remaining at the individual time points relative to
sample at time point 0 h were reported.
Glutathione stability assay. The stability of compounds in the presence of phy-
siological concentrations of glutathione was assessed according to the protocol
below: 20 µL of a 1 mM stock solution of the test compound was added to 180 µL of
glutathione (reduced form) PBS solution within a plastic HPLC insert, providing a
solution with a final concentration of 100 µM of compound and either 5 mM or 0.5
mM in glutathione. The sample was placed in a HPLC sampling rack and sampled
at hourly intervals up to 10 h. Care was taken to prepare the sample immediately
before injection. The UV area was then plotted for the loss of compound against
time. Percentages were plotted relative to total vancomycin derivative at 0 h.
Results are shown in Supplementary Fig. 4.
Microsomal stability assay. Performed by CDCO, Monash University, Australia.
Incubation methods: The solubility of test compounds and their recovery from the
incubation matrix were confirmed prior to the metabolic assay. The metabolic
stability assay was performed by incubating each test compound (1 μM) with
human (Xenotech, Lot #1210057) and mouse (Xenotech, Lot #1110071) liver
microsomes at 37 °C and 0.4 mg mL−1 protein concentration. The metabolic
reaction was initiated by the addition of a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (NADPH)-regenerating system (i.e. NADPH is the cofactor required for
cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism) and quenched at various time points over
the 60 min incubation period by the addition of acetonitrile. Control samples
(containing no NADPH) were included (and quenched at 2, 30 and 60 min) to
monitor for potential degradation in the absence of cofactors. Concentrations of
each test compound in quenched samples were determined by ultra performance
liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) (Waters/Micromass Xevo
triple quadrupole mass spectrometer). Note: Due to the minimal degradation of
test compounds in this assay, a metabolite search was not conducted. In addition,
glucuronidation was not considered in this study and may require further assess-
ment using alternative test systems.
Calculations: Test compound concentration vs. time data were fitted to an expo-
nential decay function to determine the first-order rate constant for substrate
depletion. In cases where clear deviation from first-order kinetics was evident, only
the initial linear portion of the profile was utilised to determine the degradation rate
constant (k). Each substrate depletion rate constant was then used to calculate: (1) a
degradation half-life, where t1/2 = ln(2) k−1; (2) an in vitro intrinsic clearance value,
where CLint,in vitro = k [microsomal protein content (0.4 mg mL−1)]−1; (3) a predicted
in vivo hepatic intrinsic clearance value, where CLint = CLint,in vitro × [liver mass (g)/
body weight (kg)] × [microsomal protein (mg) / liver mass (g)]; and (4) a predicted
in vivo hepatic extraction ratio, where EH = CLblood Q−1 = Clint [Q + Clint]−1.
Scaling parameters assumed were: human liver mass 20 g liver / kg body
weight49, human microsomal protein 40 mg g−1 liver mass49, 50, human hepatic
blood flow (Q) 20.7 mL min−1 kg body weight−151, mouse liver mass 87.5 g liver /
kg body weight51, mouse microsomal protein 45 mg g−1 liver mass51, mouse
hepatic blood flow (Q) 90 mL min−1 kg body weight−1 51.
In vivo pharmacokinetics. Performed by WuXi AppTec (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.
Seven to 9-week-old male CD1 mice (SLAC Laboratory Animal Co. Ltd., Shanghai,
China) weighing 25–35 g were acclimated for approximate 3 days before being used
in the study. Animals are group housed during acclimation and in-life study in
compliance with the National Research Council 'Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals.' The animal room environment is controlled (target condi-
tions: temperature 18 to 26 °C, relative humidity 30–70%, 12 h artificial light and
12 h dark) with temperature and relative humidity monitored daily. Animals were
deprived of food for approximately 16 h before formulation administration then
allowed access to Certified Rodent Diet (Catalogue # M-01F, Shanghai SLAC
Laboratory Animal Co. Ltd.) ad libitum 4 h post dosing. Water was autoclaved
before being provided to the animals ad libitum. Formulations of compounds were
prepared on the morning of the dosing day. The formulation for the IV group was
filtered with filter of 0.22 μm before being dosed to animals. After dose formulation
preparation, duplicate 50 μL aliquots were removed from each dose formulation for
use in dose validation. For each compound studied, three mice were dosed intra-
venously (IV) administered to each animal via tail vein per facility SOPs using test
article formulated in deionised water at 1 mg mL−1 with a dose volume of 2 mg mL
−1, providing a dose of 2 mg mL−1 (based on free base concentration). An addi-
tional three mice were dosed subcutaneously (SC) administered to each animal via
subcutaneous bolus on each animals’ back per facility SOPs using test article for-
mulated in deionised water at 2 mg mL−1 with a dose volume of 5 mg mL−1,
providing a dose of 10 mg mL−1. All animals were killed at the last study time point
(100% CO2 was introduced into the animal box).
Sample collection: Plasma samples were collected as the following target times
after each dose administration: IV Sampling Time points (hours post dosing): 0,
0.083, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24. SC Sampling Time points (hours post dosing): 0,
0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24. Approximately 30 μL blood was obtained via sub-
mandibular or saphenous vein for the first several time points. For the last time
point, samples were collected via cardiac puncture while the mouse was under
anaesthesia. All blood samples were transferred into pre-chilled plastic micro-
centrifuge tubes containing 2 μL of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid dipotassium
salt (K2-EDTA) (0.5 M) as anticoagulant and placed on wet ice until centrifugation.
Harvested blood samples were centrifuged within 30 min of collection at 7000 rpm
(8546 × g) 4 °C for about 10 min. After centrifugation, plasma was transferred into
another pre-labelled and pre-chilled polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes, then
quick-frozen over dry ice and stored at −70 ± 10 °C until LC/MSMS analysis.
Sample analysis: Dosing formulations verification: Aliquots of the formulations
were collected in the middle position of each dose formulation in duplicate. A LC-
UV method was developed with a calibration curve consisting of six calibration
standards. The concentrations of the test compound in dose formulation samples
were determined by the LC-UV method. Acceptance criteria for an analytical run:
at least of five of six calibration standards should be within 20% of nominal values.
Plasma samples: LC-MS/MS methods for the quantitative determination of the
test article in mouse plasma were developed with an internal standard. Benchtop
stability of the compound in mouse plasma was determined at mid QC con-
centrations in triplicate at 0, 2 h at room temperature. The stability was determined
using mean peak area ratio of T2/T0 sample. If the mean peak area ratio is within
80%~120%, the test article in the plasma is considered stable for 2 h at room
temperature. A standard curve consists of eight non-zero calibration standards for
the LC-MS/MS method with a target lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) at ≤ 3
ng mL−1. A set of QC samples consists of three concentration levels (low, middle
and high). The sample analysis was performed concurrently with a set of cali-
bration standards and two sets of QC samples using the LC-MS/MS method.
Acceptance criteria for plasma bioanalytical run: A minimum of six calibration
standards is back calculated to within ± 20% of their nominal concentrations; and a
minimum of 4 out of 6 QC samples is back calculated to within ± 20% of their
nominal concentrations.
Analyte interference: The mean calculated concentration in the single blank
matrix should be ≤ 0.5 times the LLOQ.
Carryover:. the mean calculated carry-over concentration in the single blank
matrix immediately after the highest standard injection should be ≤ LLOQ.
Data analysis: Plasma concentration vs. time data from individual animals was
analysed by WinNonLin non-compartmental model (Phoenix WinNonlin 6.2.1,
Pharsight, Mountain View, CA). Pharmacokinetic parameter C0, T½, CL, Vdss,
Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-last, AUC0-inf, %F, MRT0-last, MRT0-inf and graphs of plasma
concentration vs. time profile were derived.
MRSA thigh infection in vivo efficacy model. Performed at the University of
Queensland, following similar previous literature procedures52.
Summary: Adult (8-week-old) female CD1 mice were made neutropenic by two
injections of cyclophosphamide 4 days and 1 day prior to infection. An inoculum of
105 CFU MRSA (Strain ATCC® 43300™) was injected intramuscularly into both left
and right thighs of all mice. Two hours after initiation of infection, saline,
vancomycin or vancapticin compounds were injected subcutaneously in the lower
back region. After an additional 2 h, a 50 µL sample of blood was obtained from the
tail bleed to analyse for presence of antibiotic compound. At 24 h following
infection, mice were killed and an additional blood sample collected for compound
analysis. Thighs were then removed, weighed and homogenised in a fixed volume
of saline. The homogenate solution was filtered, diluted and seeded onto agar
plates, which wre incubated overnight at 37 °C. Colony counts were used to
establish the CFU in the thigh homogenates, the CFU thigh−1 and the CFU g−1 of
thigh.
Protocol: Compound preparation: Cyclophosphamide monohydrate (Sigma) was
dissolved in sterile saline to a concentration of 30 mg mL−1. Likewise, vancomycin
(Sigma) and vancapticins were also dissolved in sterile saline to a final con-
centration of 60 mg mL−1and 18.5 mg mL−1 respectively. All compounds were
prepared in low binding Eppendorf tubes and kept at −20 °C until used.

 Preparation of injectable MRSA solution: An MRSA subculture bacterial isolate
(ATCC®43300™) was taken from the storage at −80 °C and freshly seeded on agar
plates for overnight growth. From the overnight culture preparation, a single
colony was diluted into 10–12 mL of MHB and incubated overnight at 37 °C. A log-
phase subculture was obtained by adding 100 μL of overnight subculture in 10 mL
MHB and incubated for a further 2–3 h. Finally, the OD600 value of the bacterial
suspension was determined and the colony forming units per millilitre (CFU mL−1)
extrapolated. A full dilution of the bacterial cell suspension in saline was achieved
by washing (3220 × g for 10 min) and the OD600 in saline determined. The sus-
pension was then diluted out accordingly in order to achieve a 2 × 106 CFU mL−1
solution (105 CFU in 50 μL thigh−1).
Quantification of injected MRSA solution: In order to be able to correlate the
actual CFU mL−1 present in the MSRA injection solution with the estimated CFU
mL−1 based on the OD600 readings, a standard plate count from the MSRA
injection solution was performed. Thus, 10 µL of the injectable MRSA suspension
was diluted down to 10–1000 fold, each dilution plated out onto agar and incu-
bated at 37 °C for 24 h. From the estimated 2 × 106 CFU mL−1 solution, 18 CFU per
10 µL were found in the 1:1000 dilution, giving a final concentration of 1.8 × 106
CFU mL−1 for the actual injectable MRSA solution.
In vivo experimental assay: Eight-week-old female outbred CD1 mice (UQBR-
AIBN) were rendered neutropenic by injecting two doses of cyclophosphamide
intraperitoneally 4 days (150 mg kg−1) and 1 day (100 mg kg−1) prior to experimental
infection. The infection model using MRSA was established by intramuscular
injection of 50 µL of early-log-phase bacterial MRSA suspension (around 2 × 106
CFU mL−1) in saline into both thigh muscles. After 2 h, a single dose of vancomycin
(200 mg kg−1) or compound of this invention (25 mg kg−1) was administered by a
subcutaneous injection over the interscapular (area at back of the neck). Untreated
animals received equivalent volume of saline (Baxter). The mice were monitored for
signs of normal behaviour (i.e. grooming, eating, drinking, sleeping and alertness)
during and following dosing. Two h after saline/antibiotic treatment, 0.05 mL of
blood was collected by tail incision. 24 h after MRSA infection, mice were killed and
blood collected from the heart by cardiac puncture (saline group) or by tail incision
(vancomycin and vancapticin treated groups). For each mouse, both thighs were
collected aseptically by cutting the leg at the hip and knee, placed in 10 mL of cold
sterile saline and the individual weight of each thigh recorded.
Plasma sample preparation: Blood samples were taken at 2 h (tail incision) and
22 h (cardiac puncture or tail incision) post saline/vancomycin/vancapticin treat-
ment using Lithium-Heparin Microvette® (Sardest) or using heparin coated syr-
inges. All samples were kept at 4 °C and spun down at 10,000 × g for 15 min.
Plasma was collected and kept at −80 °C until used.
Thigh homogenates and CFU determination: Thighs were homogenised at
20,000 rpm for 15 s using a Polytron MR2500E using a 200 mm probe (Kinema-
tica). Homogenate solutions were filtered using a 100 µm pore size filter (BD) and
1 mL of filtrate solution placed on ice and serial dilutions promptly done (1:10 and
1:100) and seeded onto appropriate nutrient agar plates (Bactolaboratories) and
incubated at 37 °C overnight. Colonies were counted the next day and CFU thigh−1
and the CFU g−1 of thigh calculated based on the plate count and dilution factor.
S. pneumoniae lung infection in vivo efficacy model. Performed by Eurofins,
Taiwan, following similar previous literature procedures29, 53.
Summary: The study objective was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of test
articles in a lung infection model with S. pneumoniae (ATCC® 6301™). Male ICR
mice were inoculated intratracheally (IT) with S. pneumoniae at an inoculum size
of 2.96 × 106 CFU per mouse (20 µL per mouse). Vancapticins 19 and 24 were
administered at 25 mg kg−1 to separate groups of mice by subcutaneous (SC)
injection 2 h post-infection. The reference standard, vancomycin 1, was dosed at
25 mg kg−1 qd SC at 2 h after IT inoculation. Mortality was observed for 10 days.
An increase in survival rate of 50 percent or more ( ≥ 50%) of the treated animals
relative to the vehicle group indicates significant antimicrobial activity. Sub-
cutaneous injection (SC) of 19 and 24 at 25 mg kg−1 was associated with pro-
nounced increase in the 10-day survival rate relative to the vehicle group,
indicating significant antimicrobial activity. The vancomycin treated group, 25 mg
kg−1 SC qd, also exhibited significant antimicrobial activity ( ≥ 50% survival rate)
relative to the vehicle control.
Protocol: Test substances at 25 mg kg−1 were each administered subcutaneously
(SC) to test animals 2 h after inoculation. The dosing volume was 10 mL kg−1.
Animals:. Male ICR mice weighing 22 ± 2 g were provided by BioLasco Taiwan
(under a Charles River Laboratories Technology Licensee). Space allocation for 5
animals was 29 × 18 × 13 cm. Mice were housed in animal cages and were main-
tained in a controlled temperature (20–23 °C) and humidity (50−80%)
environment with 12 h light/dark cycles for at least three days at Eurofins Panlabs
Taiwan, Ltd. laboratory prior to use. Free access to standard lab chow for mice
(Laboratory Rodent Diet MFG (Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd. Japan)) and tap water in
bottle were granted. All aspects of this work including housing, experimentation
and disposal of animals were performed in general accordance with the Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Academy Press, Washington,
DC, 2011).
Organism: S. pneumoniae (ATCC® 6301™) was obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA). The bacterial culture was diluted in
brain–heart infusion broth containing to achieve the target inoculum size of 1.0–5.0 ×
106 CFU per 20 µL that would be inoculated intratracheally into each animal.
Chemicals: Bacto agar (Cat# 214040, BD DIFCO, USA), brain heart infusion broth
(Cat# 237500, BD, USA), fetal bovine serum (Cat# 30071.03, HyClone, USA),
sodium chloride (Cat# S7653, SIGMA-Aldrich, USA), vancomycin (Cat# V2002,
Sigma, USA) and water for injection (WFI) (Tai-Yu, Taiwan).
Equipment: Animal cage (Allentown, USA), biokinetic reader (Bio-Tek, USA),
biological safety cabinet (NuAire, USA), centrifuge (Eppendrof 5810 R, Germany),
laminar flow (Chao-Shin, Taiwan), orbital shaking incubator (Firstek Scientific,
Taiwan), Pipetman P100 (Gilson, France), refrigerated incubator (Hotpack, USA)
and ultra-low temperature freezer (NuAire, USA).
Methods: Assay # 608100 S. pneumoniae (ATCC® 6301™), Infected Lung Model.
Groups of 10 male specific-pathogen-free ICR mice weighing 22 ± 2 g were used.
Acute pneumonia was induced by intratracheal inoculation with a LD90–100 dose
(2.96 × 106 CFU mouse−1) of S. pneumoniae (ATCC® 6301™) suspended in 20 μL of
BHI. Vehicle (10 mL kg−1), vancomycin and test substances at 25 mg kg−1 were each
administered subcutaneously 2 h post-infection. Mortality was recorded daily for
10 days following inoculation. Increase of 50 percent or more (≥ 50%) in survival
rate relative to the vehicle control group indicates significant anti-infective activity.
Bioluminescence IP infection in vivo model. Performed at the University of
Queensland, following similar previous literature procedures27. Xen-29 (Caliper
LifeSciences), a methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) strain which contains a copy
of the modified luxABCDE operon of Photorhabdus luminescens was taken from
the storage at −80 °C and freshly seeded on agar plates for overnight growth at 37 °
C. From the overnight culture preparation, a single colony (tested for biolumi-
nescence) was diluted into 10 mL of MHB and incubated overnight at 37 °C. A mid
log-phase subculture was obtained by adding 100 μL of overnight subculture in 10
mL MHB and incubated for a further 2–3 h. Finally, the OD600 value of the bac-
terial suspension was determined and the colony forming units per millilitre (CFU
mL−1) was extrapolated. The suspension was then diluted out accordingly in order
to achieve a 2.5 × 108 CFU mL−1 solution (2.5 × 107 CFU in 100 μL). Seven-week-
old female outbred CD1 mice (UQBR-UQCCR) were rendered neutropenic by
injecting two doses of cyclophosphamide (Sigma-Aldrich) intraperitoneally 4 days
(150 mg kg−1) and 1 day (100 mg kg−1) prior to experimental infection. The peri-
tonitis infection model using bioluminescent Xen-29 was established by intraper-
itoneal injection of 100 µL of the adjusted bacterial Xen-29 suspension (around
2.5 × 107 CFU) in saline. 30 min after bacterial inoculation, a single dose of dap-
tomycin (50 mg kg−1), vancomycin (200 mg kg−1) or vancapticin (25 mg kg−1) was
administered by a subcutaneous injection over the interscapular area (area at back
of the neck). Untreated animals received equivalent volume of saline (Baxter). Mice
were monitored for signs of normal behaviour (i.e. grooming, eating, drinking,
sleeping and alertness) during and following dosing. Blood samples (50 µL) were
taken 5.5 h post Xen-29 inoculation by tail bleed using Lithium-Heparin Microv-
ettes® (Sardest). All samples were kept at 4 °C and spun down at 10,000 × g for 15
min. Plasma samples were collected and kept at −80 °C until used; while the pellets
were re-suspended in 100 µL of sterile saline, serial diluted and spread on agar
plates for overnight incubation at 37 °C. Xen-29 colonies were then counted, with
the CFU mL−1 blood calculated. After killing, each mouse was opened and intra-
peritoneal swabs were taken for CFU determination. Individual spleens were also
harvested aseptically, homogenised in 100 µL of sterile saline by crushing the tissue
with a syringe plunger against a 50 µm filter, serial diluted and plated on agar plates
for O/N incubation at 37 °C. Xen-29 colonies from intraperitoneal swabs and
spleens were then verified. Luminescent images were acquired using the Xenogen
IVIS-200 Optical In Vivo Imaging System (PerkinElmer). Luminescent images
were quantified with the IVIS Living Image software where the total flux (number
of photons/second) was calculated by a user defined region of interest (ROI)
covering the infection sites.
