Abstract
Background—Finding a peripheral tissue biopsy site to diagnose early Parkinson’s disease 
would be of value for clinical care, biomarker validation, and as research enrollment criteria. 
While autopsy and advanced Parkinson’s disease studies suggest submandibular gland is an 
important biopsy site, there are no studies in early Parkinson’s disease.
Objectives—Determine whether needle biopsy of the submandibular gland reveals Lewy type α-
synucleinopathy in early Parkinson’s disease.
Methods—Twenty-five early Parkinson’s disease (duration < 5 years) and 10 controls underwent 
transcutaneous needle core biopsies of the submandibular gland. Tissue was stained for 
phosphorylated α-synuclein, reviewed blind to clinical diagnosis, and only nerve element staining 
was considered positive.
Results—Mean (Standard Deviation) age 69.5 (8.3) for Parkinson’s disease group, 64.8 (8.0) 
years for controls, and disease duration 2.6 (1.1) years. Six Parkinson’s disease and one control 
subject had inadequate glandular tissue. Positive staining was found in 14/19 (74%) Parkinson’s 
disease and 2/9 (22%) control subjects. Parkinson’s disease positive and negative cases did not

 differ clinically. Adverse events (mainly swelling and bruising) were common (77% of cases), but 
were minor and transient.
Conclusions—Submandibular gland needle biopsies identified phosphorylated α-synuclein 
staining in 74% of early Parkinson’s disease subjects. False positives may be true false positives 
or may represent prodromal Parkinson’s disease. If confirmed in larger studies with eventual 
autopsy confirmation, the potential value of submandibular gland biopsies for early Parkinson’s 
disease may be to aid in clinical trial inclusion/exclusion and eventually serve as a gold standard 
for biomarker studies short of autopsy confirmation.

There has been great interest in the potential development of a peripheral tissue biopsy site 
for the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). In an extensive search for biopsy-accessible 
peripheral tissues that contained Lewy type α-synucleinopathy (LTS), the gastrointestinal 
system had the highest LTS densities and showed a rostral-caudal gradient with the 
submandibular gland and lower esophagus being most affected and the colon the least 
affected.1 Some groups have investigated colon2–5 and skin biopsies5–10 with varying 
results. Further investigations of the submandibular gland included an autopsy feasibility 
study of submandibular gland needle biopsy, showing that, in large tissue sections, all 
autopsied PD patients (most with advanced disease) had evidence of LTS in the 
submandibular gland while needle biopsy of the frozen postmortem glands identified 17/19 
of these.11 Furthermore, a follow up proof-of-concept clinical study found that there was 
LTS present in submandibular gland needle biopsies from 9/12 clinically diagnosed 
advanced PD patients with disease duration >5 years.12
A peripheral tissue marker would be more valuable for early rather than advanced PD as the 
autopsy confirmed accuracy of a clinical diagnosis of early PD is much less accurate than 
advanced disease.13 Therefore, the current study was designed to assess in-vivo 
submandibular gland needle biopsies in early PD patients (not previously studied either 
during life or in autopsy studies) with disease duration of < 5 years as well a control group 
with no clinical evidence of parkinsonism or dementia.
METHODS
Subjects
The study was performed by the Arizona Parkinson’s Disease Consortium, whose principal 
members are the Mayo Clinic Arizona and Banner Sun Health Research Institute. This was a 
cross-sectional, controlled study with 25 PD patients (9 female) and 10 similarly-aged 
normal subjects (7 female), all examined by a movement disorders specialist. Inclusion 
criteria were a clinical diagnosis of PD with disease duration of < 5 yrs. Disease duration 
was based on historical data regarding when motor symptoms began, not date of diagnosis. 
Response to dopaminergic treatment was not a criteria for enrollment, rather the diagnosis 
was based on the presence of bradykinesia plus rest tremor or cogwheel rigidity as 
previously described.13 Subjects were excluded if they had dementia, a bleeding diathesis,

 anticoagulant treatment, were medically unable to undergo biopsy, or had a history of 
salivary gland disorder. Controls were defined as individuals who had no clinical evidence 
of a neurodegenerative disorder.
All subjects signed written informed consent obtained according to the Declaration of 
Helsinki and approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board. A stipend was 
provided to all subjects.
Procedures
All subjects and controls had olfactory testing with the University of Pennsylvania Smell 
Identification Test (UPSIT-40) performed within two weeks of their biopsy.14 All PD 
subjects were required to have had a previous DaT Scan or underwent a DaT scan within 
two weeks of their biopsy. The results of the UPSIT and the DaT Scan were not used to 
determine eligibility for the biopsy.
On the day of biopsy the subject met with the otolaryngologist who fully explained the 
biopsy procedures. The biopsies were performed as outpatient procedures in a standard 
examination room.
Submandibular gland biopsy
A commercially-available 16 gauge needle was used to obtain tissue cores (Max-Core 
Disposable Core Biopsy Instrument, Bard Medical, Covington, Georgia). Submandibular 
glands were localized by palpation and biopsies were performed unilaterally as previously 
reported.12 Local anesthetic (0.5 cc of lidocaine) was injected into the skin overlying the 
submandibular gland. This was followed by a 3–5 minute waiting period to allow the 
anesthetic to take effect. The biopsy needle (10 cm in length, 1.29 mm diameter) was 
inserted transcutaneously perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the gland, to a depth of 
~22 mm. Between 3 and 6 needle cores were taken, depending on amount of tissue collected 
as determined by the otolaryngologist, for each subject by reinsertion of the needle at 
different angles through the same skin puncture site. After the procedure, pressure was used 
briefly to stop bleeding.
Tissue preparation
Tissue from submandibular gland needle cores was immediately placed in single standard 
plastic cassettes between two sponges and immersed in 70 ml of neutral-buffered 10% 
formalin (Fisher Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI). After 24 hours fixation at 4°C, the tissue cores 
were dehydrated in alcohols, infiltrated with paraffin and serial sections, positioned 
longitudinally, were cut at 5–7 μm with a rotary microtome. Every section was collected and 
mounted on a separate slide, beginning with the first appearance of tissue fragments and 
ending when tissue fragments were no longer visible as previously described.12, 13, 15 To 
reduce the number of sections to be screened, and to protect against technical failure during 
staining, half of the sections were reserved and every second section was 
immunohistochemically stained for phosphorylated α-synuclein, using proteinase K antigen 
retrieval and an immunoperoxidase reaction with nickel enhancement followed by a light 
Neutral Red counterstain.11 The primary antibody was a polyclonal antibody raised against

 α-synuclein phosphorylated at serine 12916 and has been demonstrated to be reactive only 
with the phosphorylated epitope;17 this makes it more likely that stained peripheral 
structures are pathological as we have found normal control subjects (without LTS in the 
brain) never have immunohistochemically-positive peripheral nervous system elements.1 
Adjustment of the original protocol to better suit peripheral tissue and needle cores has been 
described in detail.11
Slide Examination
Slides were examined blind to clinical diagnosis, DaT scan, and smell test results. Slides 
were initially screened by a PhD trained neuropathologist (BND), who recorded the slide 
numbers of all slides with staining features thought to represent possible specific and 
positive staining of nerve fibers, as well as those with staining considered to be non-specific 
and/or artifactual. Then a board-certified MD, PhD neuropathologist (TGB) examined all 
slides that had been marked as possibly positive as well as a random selection of slides 
marked negative or marked as having non-specific and/or artifactual staining. As previously 
published, non-specific staining was defined as epithelial cell cytoplasmic staining.11 In 
some cases, where the number of initially-marked slides was less than 25% of the total slide 
number, additional slides were randomly examined so that at least 25% of stained slides 
were re-examined. In other cases, where initial examination found only one positive slide, 
adjacent unstained slides were stained to determine the consistency of the finding. Positive 
slides were defined as those with immunoperoxidase staining that was morphologically 
consistent with neuronal fibers.
Statistics
The proportion of subjects with a positive biopsy was compared between groups by using 
the Pearson chi-square test. Confidence intervals for sensitivity and specificity were 
calculated by using the exact binomial method. Other subject characteristics were compared 
between groups by using the two-sample t test or the Pearson chi-square test. The Fisher 
exact test was used instead of the Pearson chi-square test when the minimum expected cell 
count was less than five.
RESULTS
Demographics
The PD group was an average of five years younger than the control group and a smoking 
history was less frequent, although neither were significantly different (Table 1). The mean 
(SD) duration of PD was 2.6 (1.1) years at the time of biopsy. Seventeen of the PD patients 
were on levodopa or a dopamine agonist, four were on MAO-B inhibitor monotherapy, and 
four were medication naive.
Submandibular gland biopsy findings
All 25 PD and 10 control subject biopsies were performed unilaterally. There was no 
difference in the mean number of needle cores taken per subject and the mean aggregate 
microscopically-identified gland area was no greater in the Parkinson’s disease group (Table 
1). Initial microscopic examination of the submandibular gland tissue cores showed the

 variable presence of skin, subcutaneous tissue, striated muscle and salivary gland tissue. 
Biopsies from 7 subjects (2 Control, 5 PD) had focal or multifocal chronic inflammatory 
mononuclear cell infiltrates, mostly within the stroma and often around ducts. A total of 8 of 
the subjects (7 PD and 1 Control) had a submandibular gland maximal aggregate area of <2 
mm2 and were arbitrarily defined, prior to unblinding, as being insufficient for determining 
whether LTS was present. Despite this criterion, one subject, who when unblinded was 
found to be in the PD group, judged to have insufficient tissue was still found to be LTS 
positive and is included in the LTS positive group analysis.
Overall, 14 (74%) of 19 PD subjects (18 with sufficient glandular tissue and one with 
insufficient tissue) had biopsies that were positive for LTS (Figure 1), with two or more 
slides showing stained structures morphologically consistent with nerve fibers (Figure 2). 
Positive fibers were present within nerve fascicles in the stromal connective tissue, adjacent 
to or within the walls of small arteries and arterioles, and interweaving amongst 
parenchymal serous gland cells. The two slides did not need to be adjacent sections, and no 
subject had only one positive slide. Of the 9 controls with adequate glandular tissue 2 (22%) 
had LTS (Figure 1). Of the four PD subjects that were treatment naïve, two were LTS 
positive and two were LTS negative.
The mean number of slides screened (BND), and then reexamined (TGB), did not 
significantly differ for the PD and control groups (Table 2). Maximal aggregate glandular 
area also did not differ between groups (Table 2). The total number of slides reviewed did 
not significantly differ between LTS positive and LTS negative groups although there was a 
trend for the LTS positive group to have more slides reviewed by the neuropathologist 
(Table 3). The mean number of positive slides in the PD group was 6.4 ± 4.5 (Table 2). The 
prevalence of chronic inflammation did not differ between the two diagnostic groups (4/12 
for the negative group and 3/15 for the positive group, p = 0.66). In the LTS positive control 
cases, one had 17/17 slides positive and the other had 2/22 positive. The mean maximal 
glandular area was 27% lower in the LTS positive group compared to the LTS negative 
group.
Non-specific staining of keratin was seen in skin and subcutaneous tissue in the biopsy 
samples of PD and controls.
UPSIT and DaT Scan Results
There was significant olfactory dysfunction comparing the PD and control groups (Table 1) 
while there was no difference between the LTS positive and LTS negative PD groups (Table 
3). The two LTS positive controls had normal olfaction with UPSIT scores of 35 and 36. All 
PD cases had an abnormal DaT scan while controls did not have DaT scans.
Side effects from biopsy
Side effects (mainly swelling and bruising) were common (27/35, 77% of all biopsy 
subjects), but were minor and transient. The most common side effect was mild-moderate 
swelling, present in 22 subjects. Bruising was reported by five subjects, three reported sore 
throat, and two drainage from the biopsy site. No serious adverse events occurred. There 
was no difference in the occurrence of side effects in the PD subjects compared to the

 controls. Every subject received follow-up phone calls to assess for side effects and those 
with side effects had resolution within 1–2 days of the biopsy.
DISCUSSION
This study, when considered together with previous studies,1, 11–13 presents firm evidence 
that transcutaneous needle biopsies of the submandibular gland may be used to identify 
Lewy-type synucleinopathy in patients with PD, even early PD. It is important to clarify that 
this study, nor previous studies, address the issue of biopsies for prodromal, or pre-motor, 
Parkinson’s disease. A previous biopsy study found that 75% of advanced PD patients, mean 
disease duration of 11.8 years, had LTS in their submandibular gland.12 That previous study 
was a proof-of-concept study and did not have autopsy confirmation12 and was in turn based 
on an autopsy feasibility study showing that LTS was present in large tissue blocks of 
submandibular gland from 19/19 PD cases, while a simulated needle biopsy from these same 
19 post-mortem glands found positivity in 17 (89%).11 The submandibular gland has been 
the focus of the biopsies as all the autopsied cases, published by multiple groups1, 18 had 
positive LTS in the submandibular gland, it is readily accessible to percutaneous biopsy, and 
unlike the parotid gland there is not a major neurovascular bundle that could potentially be 
damaged. Ways to increase the yield of glandular tissue, possibly by using ultrasound 
guidance, need to be considered.
As the diagnostic accuracy for clinical PD, as confirmed by autopsy, in patients with PD 
disease duration of ≥ 5 years at first visit is ~88%,13 the finding of LTS in submandibular 
gland biopsies from patients with advanced PD was not surprising but served to indicate 
promise for the method.12 The present study clearly demonstrates that LTS is also present in 
the submandibular glands of a majority of early PD patients (74%) that had adequate 
glandular tissue present. Due to the lack of an effective gold standard for the clinical 
diagnosis of early PD, it is not possible, at this time, to know the true rate of false positives 
and false negatives. False negatives are expected as the needle may miss LTS-affected 
tissue. The autopsy feasibility study indicated that needle core biopsies may be expected to 
miss approximately 10% of subjects with submandibular gland LTS.11 False positives may 
not actually be false positive as autopsy studies have shown that 10–20% of clinically 
normal elderly subjects have incidental Lewy body disease.19 The LTS positive controls in 
this study did not have REM sleep behavior disorder nor hyposmia (UPSIT= 35 and 36 in 
these cases), non-motor features that often precede motor PD.20, 21 DaT scans were not 
performed on the control subjects to know if they have an abnormality that might suggest a 
neurodegenerative disorder. Given the abundant positive nerve fibers (17/17 slides positive) 
in one case, this subject may well have incidental Lewy body disease, or “prodromal” PD. If 
true then that subject would not be a false positive in terms of peripheral synuclein staining 
in a subject with brain synuclein. It is possible that the control case with only two positive 
slides may have been a false positive due to artifactual staining that mimicked a true positive 
morphology. As all LTS positive and negative PD cases had an abnormal DaT scan, these 
cases all are likely have a CNS neurodegenerative disorder but not necessarily PD or a 
synucleinopathy.22–25 As two of the LTS negative PD subjects had normal UPSIT scores it 
is possible they did not have PD. To meaningfully calculate sensitivity and specificity, and 
to determine the disease status of the tentative false positive and false negative cases, it will

 be necessary to follow all subjects neurologically for several years to establish a more secure 
clinical PD diagnosis and/or to eventual autopsy and neuropathological diagnosis. However, 
the aggregate evidence from the combined autopsy and biopsy studies summarized here 
provides an indication that submandibular gland needle biopsy may be an improvement over 
standard neurological examination in the diagnostic accuracy of early PD, especially given 
the lack of a definitive biomarker.
While the number of slides that were reviewed by the neuropathologist may be considered 
by some to be excessive, there are multiple medical conditions that require pathologist 
review of large slide numbers to make the diagnosis. It was not the purpose of this study to 
determine a streamlined diagnostic test procedure but rather to determine the presence of 
peripheral synuclein staining in early PD biopsies. Further statistical analysis of these results 
may determine the minimal number of slides required to achieve an acceptable sensitivity.
It is important to consider the potential value of a submandibular gland tissue biopsy for 
early PD. First, many studies of disease-modifying agents, as well as symptomatic agents, 
for PD have failed in human trials. One reason for trial failure may be enrollment of subjects 
that do not have PD. Given the inaccuracy of the clinical diagnosis for early PD,13 using a 
LTS positive needle biopsy of the submandibular gland as an inclusion criterion for a 
clinical trial may reduce the overall number of patients needed in the study, result in a higher 
observed effect size and increase the probability of finding a significant treatment effect. 
Submandibular gland biopsy may also prove useful as a new gold standard, short of autopsy, 
for validation of other candidate biomarkers, although further data on this procedure is 
needed. It will be important, however, for tissue biopsy or any other biomarker of early PD 
to follow the subjects clinically to determine whether they follow a typical clinical course, 
and ultimately, to autopsy to determine whether or not the subject indeed had PD.

 Figure 2. Photomicrographs of needle core tissue from submandibular gland biopsies of subjects 
with Parkinson’s disease
Section A was stained with hematoxylin and eosin. All other sections were stained with an 
immunohistochemical method for phosphorylated α-synuclein and then counterstained with 
Neutral Red (see Methods). A) Typical needle core. Arrow on left points to a region of 
glandular tissue while arrow on right points to an area of stromal connective tissue. B) 
Arrow points to an immunoreactive nerve fiber within a stromal nerve fascicle. Asterisks 
indicate non-specific immunoperoxidase staining of gland cell cytoplasm. C) 
Immunoreactive nerve fiber adjacent to two small blood vessels (two lower asterisks). A 
small duct is also close by (upper asterisk is within duct lumen). D) Several immunoreactive 
nerve fibers running in parallel within a stromal nerve fascicle. E) Immunoreactive nerve 
fibers (arrows) within a stromal nerve fascicle. F) Immunoreactive nerve fibers adjacent to a 
small duct. Asterisks indicate non-specific immunoperoxidase staining of gland cell 
cytoplasm. G) Immunoreactive nerve fiber (arrows) within a stromal nerve fascicle. H) 
Immunoreactive nerve fibers (arrows) adjacent to unstained glandular epithelial cells 
(asterisks).
