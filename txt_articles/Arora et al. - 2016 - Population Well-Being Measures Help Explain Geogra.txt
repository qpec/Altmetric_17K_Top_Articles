Abstract
Geographic disparities in life expectancy are substantial and not fully explained by differences in 
race and socioeconomic status. To develop policies that address these inequalities, it is essential to 
identify other factors that account for this variation. In this study we investigated whether 
population well-being—a comprehensive measure of physical, mental, and social health—helps 
explain geographic variation in life expectancy. At the county level, we found that for every 1-
standarddeviation (4.2-point) increase in the well-being score, life expectancy was 1.9 years higher 
for females and 2.6 years higher for males. Life expectancy and well-being remained positively 
associated, even after race, poverty, and education were controlled for. In addition, well-being 
partially mediated the established associations of race, poverty, and education with life expectancy.

 These findings highlight well-being as an important metric of a population’s health and longevity 
and as a promising focus for intervention.
Life expectancy varies considerably across counties in the United States. A 2013 study 
found that a male born in Fairfax County, Virginia, was expected to live almost eighteen 
years longer than a male born 350 miles away in McDowell County, West Virginia.1,2 
Several studies have demonstrated that demographic and socioeconomic factors such as race, 
poverty, and education partly explain these geographic disparities.1,3–11 However, as these 
health inequalities persist and worsen, there is a growing need to identify other factors that 
account for this variation and that could guide efforts to reduce disparities.1,5–8
Population well-being—a measure that incorporates physical, emotional, and social health— 
may help explain variation in life expectancy.12–16 Well-being includes not only the absence 
of disease but also a sense of opportunity, happiness, and lack of stress. It reflects the ability 
to afford food, housing, and health care; to live in a safe neighborhood; and to work in a 
trusting, respectful environment.12,17–19 In other words, well-being comprehensively 
assesses both individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics that may influence the 
health and longevity of an entire community.17,20,21 Compared with residents of a 
community with low well-being, residents of a community with high well-being may be 
more likely to engage in healthy behaviors, develop social connections, and build strong 
support systems.12,20,22 Living in a community with high well-being may also promote 
resilience, buffer the negative impact of stressful events, and improve health throughout the 
life course.16,19,21 Therefore, population well-being may be an important community 
characteristic that explains geographic disparities in life expectancy.
Inequalities in life expectancy across demographic groups defined by race, poverty, and 
education level have been attributed to several factors, including differences in workplace 
exposures, burden of disease, and health behaviors.3–5 Population well-being, which 
considers these factors along with others, such as life satisfaction and access to housing, may 
therefore mediate the relations of race, poverty, and education with life expectancy and 
provide deeper insight into these established associations. Well-being may also express 
aspects of health that are not solely influenced by race, poverty, and education, and it may 
explain variation in life expectancy beyond these demographic characteristics.
Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that population well-being is associated with life 
expectancy independent of, and as a mediator of, race, poverty, and education. We conducted 
this analysis using county-level estimates of wellbeing from a nationally representative 
survey, the Gallup-Healthways Well-being Index.17 County-level life expectancy estimates 
were adopted from a 2013 study that demonstrated geographic disparities in life 
expectancy.1,23 This article reports the findings of our analysis and discusses the 
implications of those findings for policy makers at all levels of government.

 Study Data And Methods
Data
Our sample included 3,092 counties or county equivalents (in some states, parishes or 
boroughs) in the United States.
Our dependent variable was county-level life expectancy in 2010, measured in years and 
stratified by sex. These estimates were derived using models that incorporated five years of 
historic data and geographic patterns to improve accuracy and precision.1 The data were 
obtained from the Global Health Data Exchange.1,23
Our independent variables were the composite county-level well-being score and the six 
domain scores from the 2010–2012 Gallup-Healthways Well-being Index (GHWBI).17 The 
GHWBI is a national telephone survey of individuals age eighteen and older from all fifty 
states and the District of Columbia; approximately 1,000 telephone (landline and cell) 
surveys were conducted each day during the fielding period. The survey was influenced by 
the work of Daniel Kahneman and Ed Diener, experts in the field of well-being.24,25 The 
survey was designed to measure dimensions of overall well-being, such as standard of 
living, satisfaction with community, work relationships, and personal health. Factor analyses 
at the individual, state, and congressional district levels were conducted to refine item 
selection. As some factors were highly correlated with each other, the most statistically and 
conceptually redundant factors were combined into single indices, representing six well-
being domains: physical health, emotional health, healthy behaviors, life evaluation, basic 
access, and work environment.
These six domains, as well as population demographics, are evaluated with fifty-five survey 
questions. Physical health assesses the burden of chronic disease and recent illness. 
Emotional health measures daily emotions and the presence or absence of depression. 
Healthy behaviors assesses the prevalence of smoking, exercising, and eating fruit and 
vegetables. Life evaluation measures life satisfaction and optimism about the future. Basic 
access includes perception of safety and access to housing and health care. Work 
environment assesses job satisfaction and trust and respect in the workplace. Each domain is 
represented by an index, measured on a scale of 0 to 100. The composite well-being score is 
an unweighted mean of all six domains.17 Additional details about the survey items in each 
of the domains can be found in online Appendix Exhibit A1.26 The GHWBI has been 
validated as a measure of population well-being, and prior studies have linked it with 
employee productivity and health care utilization.17,27,28
Data on race and ethnicity in 2010 were obtained from the Area Health Resources Files of 
the Health Resources and Services Administration. These data included the percentage of 
residents identifying as black, the percentage of Hispanic origin, and the percentage 
identifying as another minority.29 Educational attainment was based on five-year aggregated 
data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey for the years 2009–13 and was 
represented by the percentage of high school graduates, measured separately by sex.30 
County-level poverty prevalence was measured by 2010 county-level percentages of

 individuals below the federal poverty level, from the Small Area Income and Poverty 
Estimates (SAIPE) project.31
Analysis
All analyses were performed at the county level and were stratified by sex. We first plotted 
county-level life expectancy against county-level well-being. We then estimated a series of 
linear regression models, with the standardized composite well-being score and each of the 
six domain scores as the independent variables and male and female life expectancy as the 
dependent variables. The regression coefficients can be interpreted as the change in life 
expectancy in years associated with a change of one standard deviation (SD) in the 
composite well-being or domain score. To account for differing precision of the estimates, 
each observation was weighted by the number of survey respondents. We first assessed 
unadjusted associations of wellbeing with life expectancy, stratified by sex. To evaluate 
whether race, poverty, and education attenuated these associations, we added these factors to 
the initial models.
We then used structural equation modeling to explore whether the composite well-being 
score mediated the associations of race, poverty, and education with life expectancy.32 
Specifically, a structural equation model was estimated for each covariate. These models 
evaluated ten pathways connecting the five covariates (percentage black, percentage of 
Hispanic origin, percentage identifying as another minority, percentage living in poverty, and 
percentage of high school graduates), the mediator (well-being), and the outcome (life 
expectancy). The goal of this analysis was to determine if well-being was an important 
driver in the relations between these population characteristics and life expectancy. 
Additional details can be found in the Appendix.26
Limitations
Our study had several limitations. First, as this was an ecologic study, with a county 
population rather than an individual as the unit of analysis, we were unable to interpret our 
findings at the individual level. Nevertheless, our focus was on communities.
Second, life expectancy may be influenced by cumulative exposures over a lifetime, but we 
assessed well-being during a three-year period only. In addition, a portion of the well-being 
data was collected after the life expectancy estimates. To increase the reliability of the well-
being estimates, we aggregated survey responses from 2010 to 2012. However, the most 
recently available county-level life expectancy estimates were from 2010. Given the timing 
of our data and the fact that this was a cross-sectional study, we were unable to make causal 
inferences between wellbeing and life expectancy. Future work should use additional years 
of data to explore how changes in well-being over time affect changes in life expectancy.
Third, in counties with small populations, life expectancy estimates were influenced heavily 
by patterns in nearby counties and structured relationships with covariates. Therefore, these 
estimates had substantial uncertainty intervals.1
Fourth, prior work has shown that the mortality rate within a certain county is associated 
with the characteristics of its neighboring counties such as race, ethnicity, and income

 inequality.9 We did not adjust for characteristics of neighboring counties; we also did not 
account for the heterogeneity in life expectancy within counties.
Fifth, although many socioeconomic and demographic factors have been associated with 
population life expectancy, we chose to adjust for race, poverty, and education because these 
are consistently recognized as strong predictors.1,3–9 County attributes such as rurality and 
social capital have previously been linked with longevity but were not included in this 
study.33,34
Finally, the well-being index sampling method has been designed to be representative at the 
state and congressional district levels but not the county level. To assess whether inclusion of 
counties with a small sample size influenced our results, we replicated analyses using only 
geographic areas with at least 100 respondents (n = 1,606).
Study Results
Among 3,092 counties, well-being scores for males and females ranged from 35.6 to 87.1 
(mean: 66.4; SD: 4.2). County life expectancies ranged from 72.6 years to 85.0 years for 
women and 63.9 years to 81.7 years for men. Counties with lower life expectancies were 
located in the South and had a higher percentage of blacks, lower education levels, and 
higher poverty rates compared with counties with higher life expectancies (Appendix 
Exhibit A2).26
Well-being was significantly associated with female and male life expectancy at the county 
level (Appendix Exhibit A3).26 For every 1-standard-deviation higher composite well-being 
score, life expectancy was 1.9 years higher for females and 2.6 years higher for males 
(Exhibit 1). When race, education, and poverty were introduced into the model, the 
associations between composite well-being and life expectancy were attenuated but 
remained significant. In the adjusted regression, every 1-standard-deviation higher 
composite well-being score was associated with 0.9 year higher female life expectancy and 
1.1 years higher male life expectancy (Exhibit 1).
The six domains of well-being were also associated with female and male life expectancy 
(Exhibit 2). The physical health index was most strongly associated with life expectancy: A 
1-standard-deviation increase in physical health was associated with 2.0 years higher female 
life expectancy and 2.5 years higher male life expectancy. The associations of healthy 
behaviors and basic access with life expectancy followed closely behind. Every 1-standard-
deviation increase in healthy behaviors was associated with 1.8 years higher female life 
expectancy and 2.2 years higher male life expectancy, while a 1-standard-deviation increase 
in the basic access index was associated with 1.6 years higher female life expectancy and 2.2 
years higher male life expectancy. After race, poverty, and education were controlled for, all 
six components of well-being remained positively associated with life expectancy, but the 
effects were attenuated. The only association that became insignificant described the 
relationship between work environment and female life expectancy (Exhibit 1).
Results from structural equation modeling analyses indicated that well-being partially 
mediated the associations of race, poverty, and education with life expectancy; all effects

 were significant (p < 0.001). The total effects represent the overall associations of race, 
poverty, and education with life expectancy, while the indirect effects represent the parts of 
these associations that were mediated by well-being. For example, the total effect of poverty 
on male life expectancy was −0.279, indicating that for every one-unit increase in the 
poverty rate, male life expectancy decreased 0.279 years. The indirect effect of −0.044 
represented the decrease in life expectancy associated with poverty that was mediated by 
well-being. Therefore, the lower life expectancy in low-income areas was partly explained 
by low well-being in these counties. The indirect effects from the structural equation models 
for race and education also indicated that well-being mediated a substantial portion of the 
relationships between these population characteristics and life expectancy (Exhibit 3).
In sensitivity analyses, excluding counties with fewer than 100 participants did not 
substantially change our results. The results from these analyses are in the Appendix.26
Discussion
Variation in life expectancy across US counties is substantial. Although differences in race, 
poverty, and education partly explain these disparities, there is a need to identify other 
drivers of this variation.1,3–7 In our study we found that population well-being was 
associated with life expectancy, even after race, poverty, and education were controlled for. 
Well-being also mediated the relationships of these socioeconomic and demographic factors 
with life expectancy. Our results highlight well-being as an important population health 
measure that explains geographic disparities in life expectancy.
Our primary finding was that population wellbeing and life expectancy were positively 
associated. Several aspects of population well-being have previously been linked with life 
expectancy or other physical and emotional health outcomes. These components include the 
prevalence of healthy behaviors, neighborhood safety, access to healthy food, and a place to 
exercise.4,6,20,35–38 However, to our knowledge, this is the first study to establish a relation 
between a summary measure of population well-being and life expectancy in a national 
sample of communities. We also found that all six components of this summary measure—
physical health, emotional health, life evaluation, healthy behaviors, basic access, and work 
environment—were significantly associated with life expectancy. It is not surprising that 
physical health and healthy behaviors were associated with life expectancy, as these 
relationships are well established in the literature.3,4 However, other domains, such as life 
evaluation, which measures life satisfaction and optimism about the future, and basic access, 
which includes perception of safety and access to housing and health care, were also 
significantly associated with life expectancy. These results demonstrate that life expectancy 
is linked with the individual- and community-level factors captured by well-being, ranging 
from the disease burden of individuals to the safety of neighborhoods.
These findings have several policy implications. By linking well-being with life expectancy, 
a well-established population health measure, we demonstrate that well-being may be a 
useful indicator of a community’s health and longevity. Organizations in the United States 
and abroad already employ well-being metrics to examine population health and to influence 
and analyze interventions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Office for

 National Statistics in the United Kingdom, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development track various measures of well-being within and across countries.19,39–41 
Aspects of well-being, including healthy behaviors and mental health, have also been used to 
evaluate the impact of Well London, a multiyear, government-supported, and community-
engaged program focused on improving health and well-being in disadvantaged 
neighborhoods of London, England. Program interventions have included mental health 
awareness training, happiness workshops to increase psychological resilience, healthy 
cooking classes, development of community gardens, and sports tournaments to encourage 
physical activity.42–44 The findings of our study suggest the possibility that these types of 
local investments in wellbeing may reduce health disparities and increase life expectancy, 
which is an idea worth testing.22
Finally, many aspects of communities with high collective well-being, such as employment 
opportunities, affordable housing, and public spaces where residents can exercise and build 
social ties, are determined not by the health care system, but by social and economic 
policies.20,21,45 Collaboration across sectors to address these community-level 
characteristics may improve well-being and, potentially, life expectancy.15,22
Although our study uniquely linked population well-being and life expectancy, many prior 
studies performed at the individual level have shown similar results. These studies have 
found that happier individuals with higher life satisfaction tend to live longer.12–14,46 This 
relationship may exist because happier individuals make better life choices, engage in 
healthier behaviors, and have stronger immune system function, while stress and negative 
emotions increase inflammation and result in telomere shortening, a known determinant of 
decreased longevity.12,47,48 At the population level, the mechanisms of the relation between 
well-being and life expectancy are likely similar but may also reflect the spread of happiness 
and healthy behaviors through social connections within a community.21,45 The persistence 
of the association between well-being and life expectancy at the population level 
underscores the opportunity to design local interventions to improve these outcomes.
Consistent with prior studies, we found that counties with higher percentages of blacks, 
higher poverty rates, and lower education levels had lower life expectancies.1,3–7,10 
Importantly, we also found that the composite well-being score remained significantly 
associated with life expectancy even after race, poverty, and education were controlled for. 
These results suggest that well-being expresses aspects of health that are not merely 
reflecting differences in demographic characteristics. A recent study by Raj Chetty and 
colleagues is consistent with our findings.6 Although the authors confirmed that income is a 
powerful predictor of life expectancy, they also discovered significant geographic variation 
in life expectancy among low-income populations. This variation was partly explained by 
differences in community characteristics such as the prevalence of unhealthy behaviors, 
government expenditure levels, and the percentages of college graduates and immigrants.6,49 
As in our study, poverty was not the only determinant of life expectancy and community 
characteristics also predicted health. The findings of Chetty and colleagues’ study and ours 
highlight a potential opportunity to improve life expectancy among socioeconomically 
disadvantaged groups by targeting community characteristics that support population well-
being.

 After race, poverty, and education were controlled for, the six components of well-being also 
remained positively associated with life expectancy, but the association between work 
environment and female life expectancy became insignificant. In other words, work 
environment significantly predicted life expectancy beyond race, poverty and education, but 
only for males. Similarly, all associations between the components of population well-being 
and life expectancy were stronger for males than for females. A deeper exploration of why 
the associations between well-being and life expectancy vary by sex was beyond the scope 
of this paper but would be an important focus for future work.
Through structural equation modeling, we showed that well-being mediated the relationships 
between race, poverty, and education with life expectancy. These results are consistent with 
findings from previous studies that explored health inequalities across demographic groups. 
Lower life expectancies among populations with higher percentages of blacks, higher 
poverty rates, and lower education levels may be caused by higher levels of stress, less 
effective chronic disease management, worse health behaviors, decreased access to 
community resources, and increased exposure to harmful workplace practices within these 
populations.5,7,10,50–52 We found that well-being, which includes these predictors of health, 
explained between 10 percent and 35 percent of the associations of race, poverty, and 
education with life expectancy. Not surprisingly, among the demographic characteristics we 
tested, poverty was most strongly associated with life expectancy. However, almost one-fifth 
of this effect was mediated by well-being. Therefore, a substantial portion of the negative 
effect of poverty on life expectancy is explained by the lower well-being experienced by 
low-income populations. Similarly, the lower life expectancy experienced by populations 
with higher percentages of blacks and lower percentages of high school graduates was partly 
explained by the lower well-being among these groups. These results emphasize the 
potential opportunity to reduce disparities in life expectancy by targeting population well-
being.
Conclusion
Population well-being—a comprehensive evaluation of physical, mental, and social health—
helps explain geographic disparities in life expectancy. Local initiatives aimed to enhance 
population well-being and its components may improve not only the quality of life in a 
community, but also the quantity of life among its inhabitants.

 Exhibit 2. Increase in life expectancy associated with a 1-standard-deviation increase in 
composite well-being or domain scores
SOURCE Authors’ analysis using data from the Gallup-Healthways Well-being Index and 
life expectancy estimates. NOTES Composite well-being and domain scores are 
standardized—that is, in units of 1 standard deviation. Coefficients represent a change in life 
expectancy associated with a 1-standard-deviation increase in composite well-being or 
domain scores.

NOTES Composite well-being and domain scores are standardized—that is, in units of 1 standard deviation. Coefficients represent a change in life 
expectancy associated with a 1-standard-deviation increase in composite well-being or domain scores. All coefficients are significant at p < 0.002, 
except for the coefficient representing the adjusted association of the work environment domain with female life expectancy (p = 0.441).

SOURCE Authors’ analysis using data from the Gallup-Healthways Well-being Index, life expectancy estimates, Area Health Resources Files, the 
American Community Survey 5-year estimates for the years 2009–2013, and data from the SAIPE project.
NOTES Each coefficient represents a change in years of life expectancy associated with a one-unit change in the exogenous variable. All 
coefficients are significant (p < 0.001). The direct effect represents the pathway from the exogenous variable to life expectancy, while controlling 
for well-being. The indirect effect represents the part of the pathway from the exogenous variable to life expectancy that is mediated by well-being. 
The total effect is the sum of the direct and indirect effects and represents the association of the exogenous variable with life expectancy.
