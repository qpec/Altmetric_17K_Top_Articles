There are no disease-modifying treatments for adult human 
neurodegenerative diseases. Here we test RNA-targeted therapies1 
in two mouse models of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), an 
autosomal dominant polyglutamine disease2. Both models recreate 
the progressive adult-onset dysfunction and degeneration of a 
neuronal network that are seen in patients, including decreased 
firing frequency of cerebellar Purkinje cells and a decline in motor 
function3,4. We developed a potential therapy directed at the ATXN2 
gene by screening 152 antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). The most 
promising oligonucleotide, ASO7, downregulated ATXN2 mRNA 
and protein, which resulted in delayed onset of the SCA2 phenotype. 
After delivery by intracerebroventricular injection to ATXN2-Q127 
mice, ASO7 localized to Purkinje cells, reduced cerebellar ATXN2 
expression below 75% for more than 10 weeks without microglial 
activation, and reduced the levels of cerebellar ATXN2. Treatment of 
symptomatic mice with ASO7 improved motor function compared 
to saline-treated mice. ASO7 had a similar effect in the BAC-Q72 
SCA2 mouse model, and in both mouse models it normalized 
protein levels of several SCA2-related proteins expressed in Purkinje 
cells, including Rgs8, Pcp2, Pcp4, Homer3, Cep76 and Fam107b. 
Notably, the firing frequency of Purkinje cells returned to normal 
even when treatment was initiated more than 12 weeks after the 
onset of the motor phenotype in BAC-Q72 mice. These findings 
support ASOs as a promising approach for treating some human 
neurodegenerative diseases.
SCA2 is caused by DNA CAG-repeat expansion leading to an 
increase in the polyglutamine (polyQ) domain in the N-terminal part 
of the ATXN2 protein. Although the disease was initially described as 
cerebellar degeneration, it is now known to involve multiple neuronal 
subtypes outside the cerebellum, and can also present as amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Parkinson disease5,6. Neurodegenerative 
diseases caused by dominant mutations in human genes have been 
difficult to approach therapeutically, and few studies have targeted 
 
disease genes directly as the first step in pathogenesis (discussed 
below). Developing therapeutics for SCAs can be complicated by the 
occurrence of repeat-associated non-AUG translation, which appears 
to be irrelevant for SCA2 (ref. 7). Although targeting the mutation itself 
appears attractive, this approach has proven to be technically difficult in 
polyQ diseases. We have used SCA2 as a model to develop an approach 
to use ASOs to directly target ATXN2 mRNA.
ASOs have recently undergone substantial development1. 
Modification of DNA backbone chemistry has reduced toxicity, 
increased target engagement, and improved destruction of DNA–
RNA hybrids. We designed multiple chimaeric 2′ 
-O-methoxyethyl/
DNA gapmer ASOs, which target ATXN2, for an in vitro screen and 
screened for ATXN2 RNA reduction in a cell-based assay, identifying 
several ASOs that reduced ATXN2 expression. After testing of these 
ASOs for in vivo tolerability, we tested one ASO in detailed behavioural, 
biochemical and physiological studies. This ASO targets exon 11 of 
human ATXN2 and is designated ASO7.
In a previous study using mice that were homozygous for the 
polyQ-expanded ATXN2, a more severe disease manifestation was 
observed than in heterozygous littermate mice, indicating that ATXN2 
dosage was important pathologically8. On the other hand, reducing 
ATXN2 dosage did not affect survival or central nervous system mor-
phology in heterozygous or homozygous knockout animals9, suggesting 
ATXN2 reduction by ASOs as a viable strategy for SCA2-mediated 
neurodegeneration.
Our in vitro screen included 152 ASOs designed in silico for targeting 
human ATXN2. The top 8 lead ASOs lowered ATXN2 expression by  
≥ 
85% (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). In vivo 
 
testing revealed ASO7 and two other ASOs among the most effective 
for lowering ATXN2 expression after a seven day treatment (Extended 
Data Fig. 2a–c). To assess astroglial and microglial activation we 
 
measured cerebellar Gfap and Aif1 expression by qPCR. We tested 
several doses of ASO7 and observed a significant reduction in ATXN2 
in cerebella after 14 days of treatment with 210 μ 
g ASO7 without activa-
tion of Gfap or Aif1 (Extended Data Figs 2a–c, 3). Some ASOs were not 
further pursued owing to activation of astroglial or microglial responses 
in treatments over 10 weeks. We verified that ASO7 as well as other 
lead ASOs were taken up by Purkinje cells by immunohistochemistry 
(Extended Data Fig. 2d–i).
ATXN2-Q127 mice have a human ATXN2 cDNA transgene with 
127 CAG repeats. We treated ATXN2-Q127 mice by intracerebroven-
tricular injection (ICV) at 8 weeks of age, coinciding with the age of 
motor phenotype onset4, with ASO7 and tested motor performance 
on the accelerating rotarod at weeks 5, 9 and 13 after ICV injection. 
Consensus criteria for the conduct of preclinical trials were closely 
 
followed (see Supplementary Discussion). Progression of motor 
 
dysfunction in saline-treated mice was as previously observed4. Mice 
injected with ASO7 had significantly improved motor performance 
compared to saline-treated control mice (Fig. 1a), and human ATXN2 
and mouse Atxn2 mRNA levels were reduced by 75% and 20%, respec-
tively, after motor phenotype testing, demonstrating target engagement 
(Fig. 2a–c).
In preclinical studies, it is important to test compounds in  
multiple 
models of the human disease. We therefore developed a mouse 
model that replicated the human disease more closely by expressing 
a  
bacterial-artificial-chromosome (BAC) transgene incorporating the 
human promoter as well as all exons, introns and flanking regions. 
The BAC resulted in expression of ATXN2 with 72 glutamines (Q72) 
in multiple neuronal tissues including the spinal cord3. The BAC-Q72 
model approximates human disease not only with regard to disease 
manifestation and less pronounced progression, but also because it 
contains the entire human gene in its proper intronic–exonic context. 
We conducted an additional preclinical trial in this mouse model with

treatment that was initiated at 8 weeks of age, as for the experiment 
using ATXN2-Q127 mice. Again, the mutated human ATXN2 and 
mouse Atxn2 were engaged by ASO7 with mRNA levels that were 
reduced by 60% and 26%, respectively (Fig. 2d), and human ATXN2 
was not detected in cerebellar lysates from treated mice by western 
blotting (Fig. 2e, f). Ten weeks after ICV injection, significant improve-
ment in motor behaviour was seen in ASO7-treated mice compared 
to saline-injected mice (Fig. 1b). However, the rotarod performance 
of the ASO7-treated mice did not perfectly mirror that of wild-type 
mice. This might indicate that additional treatment time would be 
 
necessary to more completely restore cerebellar function. Rotarod 
results observed were not affected by differences in mouse weights 
between the experimental groups (Extended Data Fig. 4).
Previously, we established transcriptome and protein profiles char-
acterized by progressive changes in the course of degeneration in SCA2 
mouse models3. To evaluate the effect of ASO7 on steady-state mRNA 
and protein levels we chose the top 6 mRNAs that showed the most 
 
significant changes in both mouse models3. Given that the 
ATXN2-Q127 model expresses the transgene specifically in Purkinje 
cells, we investigated genes significantly altered by SCA2 progression 
that are highly and specifically expressed in Purkinje cells: Rgs8, Pcp2, 
Pcp4, Cep76, Homer3 and Fam107b (ref. 3). RGS proteins inhibit 
mGlur1 (ref. 10), which is a positive regulator of Ca2+ release from 
internal stores11. Because mGlur1 signalling is disrupted in SCA2 
Purkinje cells leading to abnormal Ca2+ release, mGlur1 regulation 
may also be a function of Rgs8 (refs 3,12). mGlur1 is also regulated in 
Purkinje cells by Homer3 (ref. 13). Pcp2 is a regulator of Gi/o-coupled 
receptors including the P-type Ca2+ channel, which is important for 
sensorimotor control14. Loss of Pcp4 causes abnormal parallel fibre 
synapses in Purkinje cells15, and Cep76 is required for normal  
centriole 
function16. Fam107b and Rgs8 were identified as cerebellar hub genes

with reduced expression in SCA1 mice17. Although  
significant increases 
at the mRNA level occurred for half of the genes after ASO7 treatment 
(Fig. 2), we observed restored protein expression for all six of the genes 
on western blots (Fig. 2, uncropped western blots in Supplementary 
Fig. 1). This observation is consistent with an emerging role of 
 
polyglutamine-expanded ATXN2 in translational dysregulation3,18.
Purkinje cells are neurons that fire spontaneously with a resting 
firing frequency of 40–50 Hz in mammals. The circuits that  
underlie 
 
cerebellar learning and functioning are well understood12,19,20, 
whereby the Purkinje cells integrate signals received from parallel and 
 
climbing fibres and provide the only output from cerebellar cortex to 
deep  
cerebellar nuclei. In acute slice preparations, we have previously 
shown that mutant ATXN2 caused a slowing of Purkinje cell firing. 
This change had an onset and progression that closely mirrored that 
of motor deficits with onset at 6–8 weeks and the firing rate eventual 
slowed to 20 Hz at 24 weeks of age4. It has been suggested that the 
change in the physiology of Purkinje cells is tightly linked to Ca2+ 
homeostasis and subsequent cell death12,21. This tight linkage between 
behaviour and physiology led us to hypothesize that ASO treatment 
would restore normal Purkinje cell firing. We injected ATXN2-Q127 
mice at 8 weeks and analysed Purkinje cell physiology 6 and 14 weeks 
later in acute cerebellar slices. Similarly, we injected BAC-Q72 mice at 
30 weeks, over 12 weeks after motor phenotype onset, and analysed 
Purkinje cell firing 10 weeks later. In both models, a single injection 
of ASO7 resulted in near complete restoration of normal Purkinje cell 
firing frequency (Figs 3, 4). The mice used in these experiments were 
subsets of those in Fig. 1a, b, and had established rotarod phenotypes. 
These results suggest that ATXN2 ASO treatment directly affects 
Purkinje cell physiology and at least in part explains the amelioration 
of motor behaviour.
SCA2 and other polyglutamine diseases are characterized by toxic 
gains of function, suggesting that therapeutics that lower the expression 
of the disease-causing genes would be beneficial. ASOs represent an 
ideal approach for directly lowering ATXN2 expression, because ASOs 
are sequence-specific, well-tolerated, and can reach central nervous 
system targets by intrathecal delivery. Feasibility is further supported 
by an early-phase human clinical trial to develop an ASO therapy for 
SOD1-ALS22, and most recently by the FDA approval of the ASO drug 
nusinersin for spinal muscular atrophy. Various approaches to ASO 
therapeutics for polyglutamine diseases have been developed including 
targeting wild-type and mutant alleles as in this study or attempting 
to target mutant alleles through the expanded CAG repeat or through 
single nucleotide polymorphisms that are in linkage disequilibrium 
with the mutation23,24. Deep cerebellar nuclei that were injected with 
adeno-associated viruses, which targeted shRNAs to Purkinje cells, 
were also effective for SCA1, reducing target expression and improving 
motor and cerebellar phenotypes in SCA1-transgenic mice25,26. At least 
for SCA2 and with the caveats of preclinical mouse studies, the  
strategy 
of targeting both mutant and wild-type alleles is showing promise. One 
potential advantage of ASOs over current viral vectors is that they 
 
distribute through the nervous system, whereas adenoviral vectors are 
primarily transported transynaptically (also, gene  
transfer comes with 
more complex safety concerns). Therefore, for SCA2, adeno-associated 
viruses that are injected into neurons from the deep cerebellar nuclei 
would reach Purkinje cells, but may not reach other neuronal groups.
In conclusion, we rigorously screened ASOs to identify a potent and 
well-tolerated ASO, ASO7, that lowered cerebellar ATXN2 expression, 
and verified in two SCA2 models that ASO7 delayed SCA2 motor and 
electrophysiological phenotypes in replicate experiments. Cerebellar 
degenerative diseases provide excellent model systems to study the 
interaction of dysfunction in a neuronal network, behaviour and 
 
neurodegeneration. Our study suggests that reduction of mutant 
ATXN2 affects all three domains including endophenotypic markers 
of cell death common in ataxias3,17,27. Multiple lines of evidence suggest

that ASOs may have applications in human patients. ASO7 lowered 
expression of wild-type and mutant ATXN2 in SCA2 patient-derived 
fibroblasts (Extended Data Fig. 5). ASO7 delivered by ICV injection 
localized throughout the spinal column and lowered ATXN2 expression 
not only in brain, but also in spinal cord (data not shown). Notably, 
lowering of ATXN2 by ASO treatment or genetic knockout delays 
dysfunction and greatly extends survival of TDP-43 transgenic ALS 
mice.28. ASO7 or ASOs with further modifications in ASO chemistry 
may provide an effective human drug for SCA2, ALS caused by ATXN2 
mutation and other forms of ALS.

METHODS
SCA2 mice. Pcp2-ATXN2-Q127 (ATXN2-Q127) transgenic mice express the 
full-length human ATXN2-(CAG)127 cDNA under the control of the mouse 
Purkinje cell protein 2 (L7) promoter (Pcp2). ATXN2-Q127 mice in this study had 
a C57BL/6J;DBA/2J (B6;D2) hybrid background. ATXN2-Q127 mice are described 
in refs 3,4. BAC-ATXN2-Q72 (BAC-Q72) mice were created using a contiguous 
169 kb human ATXN2 gene sequence including 16 kb upstream ATXN2 sequence, 
the entire ATXN2-(CAG)72 coding region (with introns) and 3 kb of ATXN2  
3′ 
-UTR and downstream sequence. BAC-Q22 mice are identical to BAC-Q72 mice, 
but with the normal length CAG repeat. BAC-Q22 and BAC-Q72 mice used in 
this study had a FVB;C57BL/6 hybrid background. The generation of the BAC-
Q72 and BAC-Q22 mice is described in ref. 3. BAC-Q22 mice were used in some 
 
in vivo ASO testing experiments that are not shown. Animals were genotyped 
by two separate PCR reactions using SCA2A/SCA2B and BM13-F/BM14-R 
 
genotyping primers (Supplementary Table 2). One week after surgery animals 
were recombined into cages of four mice for the duration of the study. Mouse 
groups included a balance of males and females. All animal work was done with 
approved IACUC protocols at the University of Utah and University of California 
Los Angeles.
All mouse treatment trials were blinded to the tester. Randomized mouse groups 
for rotarod tests were arranged by a technician and rotarod testing performed 
by a second technician not aware of group assignment of mouse genotype. To 
ensure blinding, ASO-treated and saline-treated mice were housed together and 
the  
technician performing behavioural testing was not aware of treatment status. 
Group assignments were not identifiable by the technician performing pheno-
type evaluations. For rotarod testing, rotarod groups were controlled for baseline 
rotarod performance as well as weight. Additionally, when mice were transported 
to the neurophysiology laboratory they were encoded such that ASO treatments 
were blinded to the investigator performing electrophysiology  
testing. We also 
blinded the technician performing qPCR analyses using mice post  
phenotype 
testing. These measures ensured that all determinations of the effects of ASO 
treatments on SCA2 mice were made in an unbiased, operator-independent man-
ner. Additional comments on study rigor including blinding are provided in the 
Supplementary Discussion.
Antisense oligonucleotides. All antisense oligonucleotides were 20 bp in 
length, included five 2′ 
-O-methoxyethyl-modified nucleotides at each end of the 
 
oligonucleotide, with ten DNA nucleotides in the centre, and were phosphoro-
thioate modified in all positions. ASOs were synthesized as previously described29. 
The program Bowtie30 was used to determine the predicted off-targets for the 
ATXN2 ASOs in the mouse transcriptome (preRNA and mRNA). This analysis 
confirmed that the ATXN2 ASOs do not bind any RNA other than ATXN2 with full 
complementarity. We further verified that none of the lead ASOs had sequences 
that would target the closely homologous ATXN2L gene.
ICV ASO injections. ASOs were delivered to mice by intracerebroventricular 
(ICV) injection. Injection were carried out using a Hamilton 26-s gauge needle. 
For mice in Figs 1–4, injections were 6 μ 
l of 35 μ 
g μ 
l−1 ASO7 diluted in normal 
saline for a total of 210 μ 
g. Control mice received the same volume of normal saline. 
For other mice in the Extended Data Figs, injection volumes varied from 6–10 μ 
l 
to deliver the indicated ASO concentrations, with ASOs diluted  
accordingly with 
normal saline. Injections were made under anaesthesia with a mixture of oxygen 
and isoflurane, using a Stoelting stereotaxic frame. Anaesthesia was  
initiated using 
3% isoflurane for 5 min and the isoflurane mixture was lowered to 2%  
during 
 
injections. Stereotaxic bregma coordinates were − 
0.46 mm anteroposterior, 
 
− 
1.0 mm lateral (right side) and − 
2.5 mm dorsoventral. Needles were removed 
4 min after ASO delivery. Mice were maintained on a 39 °C isothermal pad while 
 
anaesthetized and during recovery.
Cell culture. SCA2 patient-derived skin fibroblasts (SCA2(CAG35)) were cultured 
and maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 
penicillin and streptomycin. All subjects gave written consent and the studies 
were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Utah. ASO 
transfections were performed by electroporation of one million cells with 0, 0.35, 
1 or 2 μ 
M ASO7 using the Neon transfection system (Invitrogen) according to 
the manufacturer’s protocol, followed by plating in 6-well plates. The cells were 
collected five days after electroporation for analyses.
Western blot analyses. Protein extracts were prepared by homogenization of 
mouse cerebella in extraction buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5% 
Nonidet P-40, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 M urea and protease  
inhibitors; 
Sigma; P-8340) followed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 20 min at 16,100g. Only 
supernatants were used for western blotting to determine the steady-state levels 
of proteins using the antibodies listed below. Protein extracts were resolved by 
SDS–PAGE and transferred to Hybond P membranes (Amersham Bioscience). 
After blocking with 5% skim milk in 0.1% Tween 20/PBS, the membranes were 
incubated with primary antibodies in 5% skim milk in 0.1% Tween 20/PBS for 
2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After washing in 0.1% Tween 20/
PBS, the  
membranes were incubated with the corresponding secondary  
antibodies 
conjugated with HRP in 5% skim milk in 0.1% Tween 20/PBS for 2 h at room 
temperature and washed again. Signals were detected by the Immobilon Western 
Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore, WBKLSO100) according to the 
manufacturer’s protocol. The intensity of proteins was determined using the ImageJ 
software analysis system and proteins were quantitated as a ratio to β 
-actin.
Immunohistochemical staining. Excised tissues were fixed in 4% paraformalde-
hyde for 72 h, and were then treated in 75% ethanol for 24 h, after which paraffin 
embedding was performed by automated instrumentation (University of Utah 
Histology Core). Embedded tissues were sectioned in 4-μ 
m sections on a Leica 
microtome and mounted on glass slides. Sections were then deparaffinized and 
rehydrated (two washes in xylene, two washes in 100% ethanol, two washes in 95% 
ethanol, one wash in water). Endogenous peroxidases were quenched by treating 
in 3% H2O2 in methanol for 10 min followed by two washes in 1× 
 wash buffer 
(TA-999-TT, Fisher Scientific). Sections were treated with Proteinase K for 10 min 
(Dako, S3020) then washed twice. Sections were treated with Cyto-Q Background 
Buster (Innovex Biosciences) then washed twice. Primary rabbit anti-ASO  
antibody 
(Ionis Pharmaceuticals) diluted 1:40,000 in antibody diluent (2% BSA, 5% normal 
donkey serum, in 1× 
 wash buffer) was then incubated on sections overnight at 
4 °C. Sections were then washed three times and incubated in secondary donkey 
anti-rabbit-HRP antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) 1:200 in antibody diluent 
for 30 min at room temperature, followed by three washes in wash buffer. Antibody 
detection was accomplished using DAB Chromagen (DAKO) followed by two 
washes in wash buffer. Sections were counterstained using  
haematoxylin (Fisher), 
washed twice in water, dipped in an acid–ethanol decolorizing solution (500 μ 
l HCl 
to 200 ml of 70% ethanol), and washed in water. Sections were then dehydrated 
(two washes in 95% ethanol, two washes in 100% ethanol, two washes in xylene) 
and mounted using permamount (Fisher). Peroxidase staining was imaged on an 
EVOS FL Microscope using 2× 
, 10× and 40× objectives.
Antibodies. The following antibodies were used for western blotting: ATXN2 
mAb (1: 4,000) (BD Biosciences, 611378), 5TF1-1C2 mAb (1:3,000) (Millipore, 
MAB1574), RGS8 rabbit polyclonal Ab (1:5,000) (Novus Biologicals, NBP2-20153), 
PCP2 antibody (F-3) (1: 3,000) (Santa Cruz, sc-137064), β 
-Actin mAb HRP 
conjugated (1:10,000) (Sigma-Aldrich, A3854). Anti-PCP4 antibody (1: 5,000) 
(Abcam, ab197377), Homer-3 antibody (E-6) (1: 2,000) (Santa Cruz, sc-376155), 
CEP76 antibody (1: 5,000) (Novus Biologicals, NBP1-28749), Anti-FAM107B 
antibody (1: 5,000) (Abcam, ab175148). The secondary antibodies were goat anti-
mouse IgG-HRP antibody (1:5,000) (Sigma-Aldrich, A2304) and goat anti-rabbit 
 
IgG-HRP antibody (1:5,000) (Vector laboratories, PI-1000). Anti-ASO antibody 
(Ionis Pharmaceuticals) and appropriate secondary antibody used for immuno-
histochemistry are described in the previous paragraph.
Quantitative PCR. Total RNA was extracted from cerebellar tissues, spinal cord 
tissues or SCA2(CAG35) patient-derived fibroblasts using the RNeasyMini 
Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. DNase-I-treated RNAs 
were used to synthesize cDNAs using the ProtoScript cDNA First Strand cDNA 
Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs). Primers for quantitative real-time PCR were 
designed to prevent amplification from genomic DNA (annealing sites in different 
exons or across intron–exon boundaries). PCR primers sequences are provided in 
Supplementary Table 2. Quantitative RT–PCR was performed in Bio-Rad CFX96 
(Bio-Rad) with the Power SYBR Green PCRMasterMix (Applied Biosystems). PCR 
reaction mixtures contained SYBR Green PCRMasterMix and 0.5 pmol primers 
and PCR amplification was carried out for 45 cycles: denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s, 
annealing at 60 °C for 10 s and extension at 72 °C for 40 s. The threshold cycle for 
each sample was chosen from the linear range and converted to a starting quantity 
by interpolation from a standard curve run on the same plate for each set of primers. 
 
Gene expression levels were normalized to the mRNA levels for Actb (for mouse 
tissues) or GAPDH (for patient-derived fibroblasts).
Rotarod testing. Cohorts of mice were bred from randomly selected breeding 
animals. Cohorts were selected randomly to have a balanced number of males and 
females. Rotarod groups were controlled for baseline rotarod performance as well 
as weight (treatment groups within any experiment had the same average rotarod 
latency to fall and weight before treatments). Rotarod testing was performed on the 
Rotamex-5 instrument (Columbus Instruments). When performing tests, animals 
were taken to a separate testing room and habituated there for at least an hour 
before testing. Animals were tested in the same order, and beginning at the same 
time each day (13:00). Mice in different treatment groups were housed together and 
the technician was blinded to treatment status. All rotarod testing in this study was 
performed by the same technician. Rotarod values per each week of testing were 
collected over five days. On day 1 mice were handled for 2 min per mouse. On day 
2 mice were introduced to the rotarod using the following paradigm: 4 r.p.m. for 
2 min, then increasing by 1 r.p.m. per every 15 s to 10 r.p.m. for 60 s. Tests on days 
3–5 on the accelerating rotarod were identical with three tests per day as follows:

mice were placed on the rod, which from 0 r.p.m. accelerated 1 r.p.m. every 9 s until 
mice fell from the rod. Most mice fell before 40 r.p.m. (6 min); all mice fell before 
50 r.p.m. (7.5 min). Values of latency to fall in seconds were recorded. The rotarod 
was cleaned between individual tests. No animals were disqualified from testing 
once testing had begun, either during training or testing phases. Note that the 
 
n mice per group used in rotarod tests of 11–15 equals or exceeds the  
minimal 
n of 11 indicated by power analyses needed to maintain > 
80 % power to detect 
significant differences between groups with effect size > 
50% in a typical 
 
repeated-measures ANOVA.
Electrophysiology. The preparation of parasagittal cerebellar slices closely  
followed 
our previously published description of the process31. Cerebella from BAC-
Q72, ATXN2-Q127 and their age-matched wild-type littermates were removed 
and quickly immersed in 4 °C extracellular solution bubbled with 95% O2 and 
 
5% CO2 (119 mM NaCl, 26 mM NaHCO3, 11 mM glucose, 2.5 mM KCl, 2.5 mM 
CaCl2, 1.3 MgCl2 and 1 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.4 when gassed with 5% CO2/95% 
O2). Parasagittal cerebellar slices (285 μ 
m) were sectioned using a  
vibratome 
(Leica VT1000). Extracellular recordings were acquired in  
voltage-clamp mode 
at near physiological temperature (34.5 ± 
 1 °C) using a dual-channel heat controller 
 
(Model TC-344B, Warner Instruments) and constantly perfused with 
 
carbogen-bubbled extracellular solution at a rate of 3 ml per min. Cells were 
visualized on an upright microscope (Leica) with a 40× 
 water-immersion lens. 
Borosilicate glass pipettes with resistances of 1–3 MΩ 
 were filled with  
extracellular 
solution and used for recording action-potential-associated capacitative  
current 
transients. The pipette potential was held at 0 mV and placed close to the 
Purkinje neuron axon hillock (soma/axon). Data were acquired at 20 kHz using 
a Multiclamp 700b amplifier, Digidata 1440 with pClamp10 (Molecular Devices) 
and filtered at 4 kHz. Each Purkinje neuron recording spanned a duration of 2 min 
and a total of 40 to over 100 cells were measured from each mouse. A total of 1–4 
mice per genotype were used and the experimenter was blinded to the mouse 
genotype. Experiments were analysed using both Clampfit and Igor Program and 
further analysed using Microsoft Excel. Figures were made using Igor. Results are 
presented as mean ± s.e.m., unless indicated otherwise.
Statistical analysis. Statistical differences between selected groups evaluated by 
qPCR were determined by two-tailed Student’s t-tests. Electrophysiological data 
were evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests followed by post hoc 
tests of significance (Tukey’s multiple-comparison test). Statistical comparisons 
of rotarod data were determined using the method of generalized estimating 
 
equations with the independent correlation option using Stata 12 (procedures xtset 
followed by xtgee). The independent correlation option was employed because in 
the three day rotarod paradigm, regressions for wild-type mice frequently have 
more positive correlation coefficients than SCA2 mice. Regression analyses were 
performed using GraphPad Prism.

Extended Data Figure 1 | In vitro screen for ATXN2 ASOs by qPCR. 
A total of 152 ASOs were delivered at 4.5 μ 
M to HepG2 cells by 
electroporation in two 384-well plates. ATXN2 expression was evaluated 
by qPCR (n = 3 wells per ASO). Shown is the evaluation of the eight 
best positive hit ASOs for half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) 
determination. Values are mean ± s.d. of ATXN2 quantity relative to total 
RNA. Cont., scrambled control ASO.

After 7 days treatment, the expression of mouse Atxn2 or human ATXN2 
and Aif1 was determined by qPCR relative to Actb. a, Wild-type FVB 
mice. Whereas ASO7 reduced mouse Atxn2 the most by 50%, significant 
reduction of mouse Atxn2 was not indicated by ANOVA testing for any of 
ASOs. ASO8 significantly elevated Aif1 expression (P < 0.05). b, BAC-Q72 
mice. ATXN2 expression was significantly reduced by ASOs 1, 3 and 7  
compared to saline (P < 0.001, 0.01 and 0.01, respectively). Elevations of 
Aif1 was not observed compared to saline-treated mice. c, ATXN2-Q127 
mice. Compared to saline treated mice, ASOs 1, 3, 7 and 8 all significantly 
lowered ATXN2 expression by 40% or greater (P < 0.001), whereas ASOs 3 
and 8 increased Aif1 expression (P < 0.001). Values are mean ± s.d. relative 
to those determined from normal saline-treated mice. Statistical tests were 
ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni correction. Technical replication was 
inserted by employing qPCR with triplicate determinations, and biological 
replication was made by evaluating multiple mice and/or mouse lines. The 
number of mice (left-to-right in each chart) was as follows: a, n = 2, 2, 2, 3, 
2, 2, 2, 2, 1; b, n = 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2; c, n = 2, 3, 1, 1, 1. d, e, ASOs localized 
to the cerebellar Purkinje cell layer of treated mice. Mice were treated by 
ICV injection into the right lateral ventricle of the indicated lead ASOs 
for 7 days in BAC-Q72 mice (ASO3 and ASO7 used at 250 μ 
g) or 10 weeks 
in ATXN2-Q127 mice (ASO1 used at 200 μ 
g). ASOs were localized in 
paraffin embedded sections by immunohistochemical peroxidase staining 
using an anti-ASO antibody. Saline, ATXN2-Q127 mice treated by ICV 
injection of 7 μ 
l saline for 10 weeks. d, 10× objective. e, 3× digital zoom

by dose and time. a–c, Dose response for ASO7 on ATXN2 expression  
in BAC-Q72 mice treated with ASO7 by ICV injection for 14 days.  
a, Expression of cerebellar human ATXN2 and mouse Atxn2 determined 
by qPCR. The 210 μ 
M dose reduced ATXN2 by 63.2% (P < 0.01) and 
mouse Atxn2 by 44.5% (P < 0.001) compared to the 0 μ 
M dose. The 
statistical test used was ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni correction.  
b, Cerebellar Aif1 expression determined by qPCR demonstrated that 
Aif1 levels were not significantly altered by ASO7 treatment. c, Cerebellar 
Gfap expression determined by qPCR demonstrated that Gfap levels were 
not significantly altered by ASO7 treatment. a–c, The replicate number of 
mice for the saline, 52 μ 
g, 105 μ 
g and 210 μ 
g treatments was 3, 2, 3 and 3, 
respectively, and the values indicated are mean ± s.d. The experiment was 
performed once.

Extended Data Figure 4 | Weights of mice before and after rotarod 
testing. a, Rotarod test of ATXN2-Q127 mice treated with a single ICV 
dose of 210 μ 
g ASO7. b, Rotarod test of BAC-Q72 mice treated with a 
single ICV dose of 175 μ 
g ASO7. Weeks of ASO treatments are indicated 
on the x axes. Mouse weights were unaffected by ASO7 treatment. 
Significant differences between weights of BAC-Q72 mice compared to 
wild-type littermates were observed (P < 0.001 for any age group, Student’s 
t-test). The relevance of mouse weights on motor phenotype testing is 
discussed in the Supplementary Discussion.

Extended Data Figure 5 | ASO7 lowered expression of wild-type and 
mutant ATXN2 in cultured SCA2 patient-derived fibroblasts. a, Patient-
derived SCA2(CAG35) fibroblasts were transfected with the indicated 
quantities of ASO7. After 72 h RNA was prepared and total ATXN2 
expression was determined by qPCR. Values are mean ± s.d. of 3 technical 
replicates from single cultures. ATXN2 was reduced by 79% for the 2 μ 
M 
dose compared to 0 μ 
M (P < 0.001, Student’s t-test). b, To determine ASO7 
effect on the expression of non-mutant (CAG22) and mutant (CAG35) 
ATXN2, RT–PCR reactions were evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis, 
with loading controlled for by GAPDH. Both a and b were replicated once 
yielding nearly the same result.
