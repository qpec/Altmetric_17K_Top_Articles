Death rates by specific causes vary across the 50 states and 
the District of Columbia.* Information on differences in rates 
for the leading causes of death among states might help state 
health officials determine prevention goals, priorities, and 
strategies. CDC analyzed National Vital Statistics System data 
to provide national and state-specific estimates of potentially 
preventable deaths among the five leading causes of death in 
2014 and compared these estimates with estimates previously 
published for 2010. Compared with 2010, the estimated 
number of potentially preventable deaths changed (supple-
mental material at https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/42472); 
cancer deaths decreased 25% (from 84,443 to 63,209), stroke 
deaths decreased 11% (from 16,973 to 15,175), heart disease 
deaths decreased 4% (from 91,757 to 87,950), chronic lower 
respiratory disease (CLRD) (e.g., asthma, bronchitis, and 
emphysema) deaths increased 1% (from 28,831 to 29,232), 
and deaths from unintentional injuries increased 23% (from 
36,836 to 45,331). A better understanding of progress made 
in reducing potentially preventable deaths in the United States 
might inform state and regional efforts targeting the preven-
tion of premature deaths from the five leading causes in the 
United States.
To determine significant changes in the number of 
potentially preventable deaths for the five leading causes 
of death in the United States, CDC analyzed National 
Vital Statistics System mortality data from 2014 (1) using 
the same analytic model presented in the original report 
that used 2010 data as benchmarks (2). The number of 
potentially preventable deaths per year per state in persons 
aged <80 years was determined by comparing the number 
of expected deaths (based on the cause-specific average 
death rate of the three states with the lowest 2008–2010 
average rate by age groups) with the number of observed 
deaths in 2010 and 2014. Further detail on age-adjusted 
rates by state and cause can be found in yearly publications 
on final death data (1).
Population estimates for 2010 and 2014 were produced by 
the U.S. Census Bureau. The calculations of potentially pre-
ventable deaths were restricted to U.S. residents and deaths in 
persons aged <80 years. Premature death was defined as a death 
that occurred in a person aged <80 years, based on the average 
life expectancy for the total U.S. population, which was nearly

79 years in 2010 (2). Analysis was restricted to deaths with 
an underlying cause of death among the five leading causes, 
based on International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision 
(ICD-10) codes.† The five leading causes of death represented 
63% of all deaths in 2014, a decrease of 2.3% compared with 
2010. In 2014 the next five most frequent causes accounted 
for approximately 12% of deaths (3).
The number of potentially preventable deaths for each 
of the five leading causes of death by state in 2014 was 
calculated in four steps. The first step was to calculate and 
rank state disease-specific death rates by age group. Using 
2008–2010 data, the three states with the lowest observed 
death rates for each age group and specific cause of death 
category were selected and their death rates averaged across 
the three states to calculate a lowest average age-specific 
death rate for each cause of death. For example, during 
2008–10, among persons aged 40–49 years, the three states 
with the lowest rate of death from unintentional injuries were 
Maryland, New Jersey, and New York, and the benchmark 
average was 25.2 (supplemental material at https://stacks.
cdc.gov/view/cdc/42342).
The average of the lowest three states was chosen to minimize 
the effect of any extreme outlier and to represent the low end 
of the distribution of death rates among the states. The second 
step was to calculate expected deaths for each age group and 
state by multiplying the age-specific state populations for 2010 
by the 2010 benchmark death rates (i.e., the lowest three-state 
average age-specific death rates for each cause). Total expected 
deaths for each cause and state were calculated by summing 
expected deaths over all age groups aged <80 years, effectively 
taking into account differences in mortality across age groups. 
These state-specific and cause-specific expected death counts 
represent the number of deaths expected if all states were to 
achieve the 2010 death rate benchmarks (2). Third, the 2010 
potentially preventable deaths were calculated by subtract-
ing expected deaths from 2010 observed deaths. Finally, the 
same 2010 benchmark death rates for each cause were used 
to calculate 2014 potentially preventable deaths by repeating 
the third and fourth steps with 2014 population and mortal-
ity data. Specifically, the number of expected deaths in 2014 
was calculated by multiplying the 2010 benchmark death 
rates by the 2014 age-specific populations; these expected 
counts were then subtracted from 2014 observed deaths. The 
numbers of potentially preventable deaths for each cause were 
assumed to follow a Poisson distribution, and standard errors 
were calculated, taking into account stochastic variation, 
consistent with methods described previously (2), in both the 
expected and observed number of deaths§ for each cause and 
year. Statistically significant changes from 2010–2014 were

assessed using a two-sided z-test (p<0.01). Results are presented 
for the United States as a whole, by state, and by the 10 U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services regions.¶
The five leading causes of death for persons aged <80 years 
in 2014 (diseases of the heart, malignancies [cancer], cerebro-
vascular diseases [stroke], chronic lower respiratory diseases 
[CLRD], and unintentional injuries [accidents]) represent 63% 
of deaths from all causes. The estimated number of potentially 
preventable deaths and the proportion preventable among the 
five leading causes of death in persons aged <80 years were 
87,950 for diseases of the heart (30% preventable); 63,209 for 
cancer (15% preventable); 45,331 for unintentional injuries 
(43% preventable); 29,232 for CLRD (36% preventable); and 
15,175 for stroke (28% preventable) (Figure).
Potentially preventable deaths from cancer declined 25% 
from 2010 to 2014 (the increase in the expected number of 
deaths was greater than the increase in the observed num-
ber). This decline appears to be driven by a 12% decrease 
in the age-adjusted death rate from lung cancer from 2010 
and 2014. Decreases in age-adjusted death rates from cancer 
were observed across all U.S. states, except the District of 
Columbia (supplemental material at https://stacks.cdc.gov/
view/cdc/42343). The expected number of deaths was based 
on benchmark death rates from 2010; however, cancer-related 
death rates declined during 2010–2014. In both 2010 and 
2014 the Southeast (Region 4) had the highest number of 
potentially preventable deaths for each of the five leading causes 
of death (Table 1). In 2014, the Northwest (Region 10) had 
the lowest number of potentially preventable deaths for each 
of the five leading causes of death except deaths from CLRD 
and unintentional injuries, where the lowest number occurred 
in New York and New Jersey (Region 2) (Table 2).
Consistent with increases in population since 2010, particu-
larly among older age groups, the number of observed deaths

 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report
MMWR / November 18, 2016 / Vol. 65 / No. 45 
1253
US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
increased for each of the five leading causes of deaths in 2014, 
and age-adjusted death rates declined during 2010–2014 for 
each category except unintentional injuries. Specifically, from 
2010 to 2014, age-adjusted death rates per 100,000 popula-
tion for heart disease declined 6.8% from 179.1 to 167.0; for 
cancer, from 172.8 to 161.2 (6.7% decrease); for stroke, from 
39.1 to 36.5 (6.6% decrease); and for CLRD, from 42.2 to 
40.5 (4.0% decrease). For unintentional injuries, age-adjusted 
death rates increased 6.6%, from 38.0 to 40.5 (supplemental 
material at https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/42341) (1). Among 
subcategories of unintentional injury deaths for all ages, age-
adjusted death rates for poisonings increased 25%, and falls 
increased by 12% (supplemental material at https://stacks.
cdc.gov/view/cdc/42344). Prescription drug and illicit drug 
overdose was a major contributor to the increase in poisonings 
during 2010–2014 (4).
Discussion
The results of this analysis show that the number of observed 
deaths increased for each of the leading five causes of death, 
consistent with increases in population size in 2014, compared 
with 2010. Age-adjusted death rates declined overall for all causes 
of death combined in 2014 compared with 2010. Potentially 
preventable deaths declined during 2010–2014 for three of the 
five leading causes of death: diseases of the heart, cancer, and 
stroke. No change was observed for potentially preventable 
deaths from CLRD. Potentially preventable deaths from unin-
tentional injuries increased from 2010 compared with 2014. 
States in the Southeast continued to have the highest number 
of potentially preventable deaths from all five causes in 2014.
Although substantial progress was made in combatting 
infectious diseases during the early part of the 20th century, 
additional focus has shifted toward prevention of noncommu-
nicable diseases, including chronic diseases, and unintentional 
injuries (5,6). The decrease in cancer deaths can be attributed, 
in part, to progress in prevention, early detection, and treat-
ment (7). Improvement of quality of care and reduction in risk 
factors, including increased number of persons with hyperten-
sion under control, have contributed to the decline in death 
rates for heart disease and stroke.** Tobacco use is a risk factor 
for some of the deaths included in this report, such as heart dis-
ease, cancer, CLRD, and cerebrovascular diseases.†† Mortality 
from tobacco-related causes has decreased in conjunction with 
national decreases in tobacco use across the United States, but 
an estimated 40 million adults (16.8%) smoked in 2014 (8). 
Implementation of evidence-based tobacco control interven-
tions, including increased tobacco product prices, implementa-
tion and enforcement of comprehensive smoke-free laws, media 
campaigns, and access to proven resources (e.g., quit lines) to 
help persons quit tobacco use§§ varies among states. In addition 
to tobacco use, other health behaviors contribute to premature 
deaths and create opportunities for prevention. For example,

† Negative potentially preventable deaths occurred when a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services region included one or more of the states with the lowest 
three death rates (the lowest three death rates were averaged to create the benchmark death rates) for at least a few age groups. Negative potentially preventable 
deaths were preserved in this table to test changes from 2010 to 2014, but were truncated to zero and not included in the totals for the United States in the table

obesity increases the risk for CLRD, diseases of the heart, and 
cerebrovascular disease, in addition to some cancers.¶¶
Although the number of potentially preventable deaths 
declined during 2010–2014 for heart disease, cancer, and 
stroke, observed deaths increased overall for these causes. 
Based on the methodology used for this analysis, when the 
pace of the increase in observed deaths is slower than the 
growth in population, potentially preventable deaths will 
decrease. Observed deaths increased 6% for heart disease, 4% 
for cancer, 4% for stroke, and 8% for CLRD. These increases 
were smaller than would be expected to result from population 
growth, particularly growth in population size among older 
age groups during this period.
In contrast, both observed and potentially preventable deaths 
from unintentional injuries increased during 2010–2014. 
Examples of state actions to reduce drug overdose include 
developing or enhancing prescription drug monitoring pro-
grams, adopting clinical prescribing guidelines, and increasing 
access to medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder 
and naloxone to reverse opioid-related poisoning (9). As the 
U.S. population aged, falls among older adults increased. Tools 
such as STEADI, designed to assist clinicians in assessing fall 
risk, educating patients, and selecting interventions, are avail-
able from CDC.***
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, the same method used in a previous report was 
applied to set a benchmark for potentially preventable deaths 
(2). These benchmarks are based on data from the states with 
the lowest death rates for each condition during 2008–2010 
alone. The benchmarks might need to be reevaluated over time, 
especially given shifts in cause-specific death rates observed 
using provisional mortality data from 2015–2016.††† For 
example, death rates from unintentional injury were increasing 
before 2008–2010, resulting in benchmarks that might not 
be comparable to historical lows or international points of 
reference. Second, alternative ways of defining and measuring 
potentially preventable or premature avoidable mortality have 
been used in other studies and no gold standard exists (10). 
Third, a lowest average rate was calculated based on individual 
states. The sum of the individual potentially preventable deaths 
by state is qualitatively different from estimating the number of 
potentially preventable deaths for the United States as a whole. 
Fourth, changes in the number of potentially preventable 
deaths by cause are not necessarily independent. For example, 
whereas some cancer deaths might be prevented entirely, some 
might be shifted into another cause grouping, such as heart 
disease. Finally, defining potentially preventable deaths across 
the five leading causes does not take into consideration the 
fact that these are complex and diverse causes of death. Not all 
deaths are equivalently preventable across the leading causes or 
within each leading cause. For example, certain types of cancer 
might be considered more or less preventable than other types, 
and some specific mechanisms of injury deaths (e.g., drug poi-
soning) might be considered completely preventable and other 
mechanisms less preventable. In addition, the majority of risk 
factors do not occur randomly in populations; they are closely 
related to the social, demographic, environmental, economic, 
and geographic attributes of the neighborhoods in which per-
sons live and work.§§§ However, from a health equity perspec-
tive, every state can be compared with the same benchmark 
rates regardless of demographic differences. If health disparities 
were eliminated, as is called for by Healthy People 2020,¶¶¶ all 
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Deaths from heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory 
disease, cerebrovascular diseases (stroke), and unintentional 
injuries account for the five leading causes of death in the 
United States. Death rates for these diseases vary widely across 
states, related to variation in the distribution of social 
determinants of health, access and use of health services, and 
public health efforts.
What is added by this report?
There has been a significant decrease in the number of 
potentially preventable deaths among three of the five leading 
causes of death (diseases of the heart, cancer, and stroke) 
during 2010–2014. However, the number of potentially 
preventable deaths from unintentional injuries increased 
significantly during the same period. This is mostly attributed to 
an increase in drug poisoning (overdose from prescription and 
illicit drugs) and falls. No significant change was observed in 
potentially preventable deaths from chronic lower respiratory 
disease (e.g., asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema).
What are the implications for public health practice?
Public health officials can use the decreases observed as 
benchmarks for improving population health, while using 
observed increases to direct targeted efforts to reduce the 
number of potentially preventable deaths. A joint effort of 
public health and health care organizations can support 
analysis and action to reduce the number of potentially 
preventable deaths from the five leading causes of death. 
Specifically, given the reported increase in potentially 
preventable deaths from unintentional injuries, these findings 
might inform the selection and implementation of evidence-
based interventions to prevent deaths from injuries such as falls 
and drug overdoses, based on epidemiologic burden.

states could be closer to achieving the lowest possible death 
rates for the five leading causes of death.
Further analysis of state and regional differences in death 
rates for the five leading causes of death could assist state and 
federal health officials in establishing prevention goals, pri-
orities, and strategies. Clinical preventive services, including 
physician tobacco cessation counseling, as recommended by 
the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force**** for heart disease, 
stroke, cancer, and CLRD also provide opportunities for 
addressing preventable deaths.††††
