IMPORTANCE Hospital readmission rates following surgery are increasingly being used as a
marker of quality of care and are used in pay-for-performance metrics. To our knowledge,
comprehensive data on readmissions to the initial hospital or a different hospital after
emergency general surgery (EGS) procedures do not exist.
OBJECTIVE To define readmission rates and identify risk factors for readmission after
common EGS procedures.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Patients undergoing EGS, as defined by the American
Association for the Surgery of Trauma, were identified in the California State Inpatient
Database (2007-2011) on January 15, 2015. Patients were 18 years and older. We identified
the 5 most commonly performed EGS procedures in each of 11 EGS diagnosis groups. Patient
demographics (sex, age, race/ethnicity, and insurance type) as well as Charlson Comorbidity
Index score, length of stay, complications, and discharge disposition were collected. Factors
associated with readmission were determined using multivariate logistic regression models
analysis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Thirty-day hospital readmission.
RESULTS Among 177 511 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 57.1% were white, 48.8% were
privately insured, and most were 45 years and older (51.3%). Laparoscopic appendectomy
(35.2%) and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (19.3%) were the most common procedures. The
overall 30-day readmission rate was 5.91%. Readmission rates ranged from 4.1% (upper
gastrointestinal) to 16.8% (cardiothoracic). Of readmitted patients, 16.8% were readmitted at
a different hospital. Predictors of readmission included Charlson Comorbidity Index score of 2
or greater (adjusted odds ratio: 2.26 [95% CI, 2.14-2.39]), leaving against medical advice
(adjusted odds ratio: 2.24 [95% CI, 1.89-2.66]), and public insurance (adusted odds ratio: 1.55
[95% CI, 1.47-1.64]). The most common reasons for readmission were surgical site infections
(16.9%), gastrointestinal complications (11.3%), and pulmonary complications (3.6%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Readmission after EGS procedures is common and varies
widely depending on patient factors and diagnosis categories. One in 5 readmitted patients
will go to a different hospital, causing fragmentation of care and potentially obscuring the
utility of readmission as a quality metric. Assisting socially vulnerable patients and reducing
postoperative complications, including infections, are targets to reduce readmissions.

H
ospital readmission rates following surgery are in-
creasingly used as a marker of quality of care and are
used in pay-for-performance metrics. As such,
reducing hospital readmission rates has become a focus of
both physicians and hospital administrators as well as
policy makers.1-4
Emergency general surgery (EGS) patients represent
a unique population at high risk for medical errors and
complications following surgery.5-8 Approximately half of
all patients undergoing EGS will have a postoperative
complication,7-9 and postoperative complications have been
closely linked to hospital readmission.10-12 This disproportion-
ate burden of complications is of critical importance because
it would seem to place the EGS patient at increased risk for re-
admission. Furthermore, patients’race/ethnicity and proxies
for socioeconomic status, such as insurance payor status, dif-
fer in EGS patients when compared with patients undergoing
elective procedures.13 Patients undergoing EGS are more likely
to be minorities, uninsured, or on government insurance, and
these demographic groups are known to have disproportion-
ally higher readmission rates.14,15 Put together, these factors
highlight the need to closely examine readmission rates in EGS
patients and identify the patterns of readmissions in this
population.
Studies on readmission rates in surgical patients are lim-
ited by the restricted number of procedures they examine, the
exclusive age categories that are included, and the lack of dis-
tinction of EGS patients from other surgical patients.16-20 It has
been shown that outcomes in surgical patients, including re-
admission rates, vary significantly by patient age, procedure
type, and surgical specialty.10,16,20-22 Therefore, to define the
rates, identify risk factors, and describe the patterns of hos-
pital readmission among a representative group of EGS pa-
tients, while accounting for variations in patients’age groups
and diagnoses, we analyzed hospital discharge records from
a statewide database. We hypothesized that surgical compli-
cations would be responsible for the majority of readmis-
sions and that demographic factors and admission character-
istics would contribute to rates of readmission in the EGS
population.
Methods
Selection of Study Population
Hospital discharge records in the California State Inpatient Da-
tabase, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality were extracted from 2007 to
2011. This database contains records from all participating hos-
pitals in the state. The California State Inpatient Database was
composed of 13 037 628 discharges during the study and en-
compasses more than 98% of the hospital discharges in the
state.23 Patients had unique identifiers assigned to them that
made it possible to track their admissions during the study as
long as they were readmitted within the state.
We included patients with an EGS diagnosis as defined by
the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma using a
previouslydefinedlistof467InternationalClassificationofDis-
eases, Ninth Revision codes.24 To facilitate analysis and sub-
sequent benchmarking, we categorized the patients into 11 di-
agnosis groups as described by the American Association for
theSurgeryofTrauma,namely:cardiothoracic,colorectal,gen-
eral abdominal conditions, hepatic-pancreatic-biliary, her-
nias, intestinal obstruction, resuscitation, soft tissue, upper
gastrointestinaltract,vascular,andothers.Thediagnosescodes
associated with each diagnosis group have been previously
published.24
The database contains information on whether admis-
sions were scheduled or not scheduled. It also has informa-
tion on the source of admission: eg, emergency department,
other hospital, and other health care facility. We limited our
selection to patients who had unplanned admissions through
the emergency department and who underwent a surgical pro-
cedure on the day of admission. We excluded patients who had
procedures that were not likely performed by general sur-
geons, such as interventional radiology procedures, cardiac
procedures, or complex vascular procedures. From this co-
hort, we analyzed those patients who had 1 of the 5 most com-
mon procedures performed in each diagnosis group.
To ensure that we were capturing true emergencies and
not cases that were scheduled during patients’hospital stays,
we excluded patients who underwent surgical procedures on
any day other than the day of admission. We also excluded pa-
tients who were admitted or discharged in the last month of
data collection (to ensure at least 30 days of postdischarge
follow-up for each patient) and patients who died during
admission or were transferred to another hospital. This study
examined deidentified data and was deemed exempt from
full review by the institutional review board of Partners
Healthcare.
Study Variables
Weincludeddemographicinformationincludingage,sex,race/
ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, Na-
tive American, and others), and insurance type (private, Medi-
care/Medi-Cal, self-pay, and others). Medi-Cal is the State of
California’
s equivalent of Medicaid, and insurance type clas-
sified as others included worker’
s compensation, county in-
digent programs, other government aids, and other indigent
funds.25
Clinical variables measured included the Charlson Comor-
bidity Index, which was calculated by the CHARLSON pro-
gram for Stata version 13 (StataCorp).26 The Charlson Comor-
bidity Index score includes 19 diseases weighted on the basis
of their association with mortality, ranging from 0 to 37, with
a higher score indicating greater comorbidity.27 Other vari-
ables included were length of hospital stay, complications dur-
inghospitalstay,anddischargedisposition(home,homehealth
care, skilled nursing facility/intermediate care facility/other fa-
cilities, and against medical advice).
Statistical Analysis
The 30-day readmission rate was calculated as the propor-
tion of patients who had unplanned readmissions within 30
days after discharge. We stratified the patients by diagnosis
groupsandcalculated30-dayreadmissionratesforeachgroup.

Only 9 of the 11 groups were included in further analyses be-
cause some groups either contained too few patients (resus-
citation) or were too ambiguous (others).
We performed univariate logistic regression analyses to
identify factors associated with 30-day readmission. Factors
that were not significantly associated with readmission in the
univariate analysis (P < .10), except sex (in which association
with readmissions has been previously shown22), were ex-
cluded from the multivariate analyses. Multivariate logistic re-
gression models were fitted to identify independent associa-
tions with readmissions. Reference categories used in making
comparisons included age (18 to 44 years), sex (male), race/
ethnicity (white), insurance type (private), Charlson Comor-
bidity Index score (<2), length of stay (≤3 days), complica-
tions during admission (absent), and discharge disposition
(home).
To measure the degree of variation in readmission rates
among diagnosis groups, we predicted the readmission rates
foreachdiagnosisgroupusingthemultivariatemodelsthatad-
justed for factors we observed were associated with readmis-
sion. Because of the potential differences in outcomes seen in
elderlypatientswhencomparedwithyoungerones,werepeated
these analyses on an age-stratified sample of patients.
Using the admitting International Classification of Dis-
eases, Ninth Revision codes on readmission, we identified the
major reasons for readmission and categorized them into
previously described convenient clinically meaningful cat-
egories, which included gastrointestinal, surgical infections,
malnutrition, wound complications, genitourinary, vascular,
pulmonary, cardiac, pain, neurologic, and others.10 We also
calculated the proportion of patients who were readmitted at
hospitals different from the hospitals of index admission and
identified factors associated with readmission at a different
hospital using univariate and multivariate logistic regression
models. All analyses were done using Stata Statistical Soft-
ware release 13 (StataCorp LP), and the significance level was
set as P < .05.
Results
Population Characteristics
Amongtheproceduresperformed,weselectedthe5mostcom-
monproceduresineachdiagnosisgroup,resultingin44unique
procedures that were used for further analyses. As the diag-
nosis groups were categorized by International Classification
of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis codes and not proce-
dure codes, several procedures were found in more than 1 di-
agnosis group. Overall, the 5 most common procedures were
laparoscopic cholecystectomy, laparoscopic appendectomy,
other incision with drainage of skin and subcutaneous tissue,
other appendectomy, and other partial resection of the small
intestine. Combined, these 5 procedures accounted for more
than 50% of all the operative procedures that were per-
formed on patients in this cohort (data not shown). The full
listofthetop5proceduresperdiagnosisgroupandthe44most
common procedures in EGS patients are included in the
eAppendix in the Supplement.
Our final cohort included 177 511 patients (eFigure in the
Supplement). Of these, 57.07% were white, 48.76% were pri-
vately insured, and most were 45 years and older (51.26%)
(Table 1). The Charlson Comorbidity Index score was less than
2 in 90.37% of patients.
The mean length of stay was 3.2 days, and 72.63% of the
patients were hospitalized for less than 4 days. Complica-
tions during admission were seen in 16.46% of patients, and
89.93% were discharged directly to their homes.
The upper gastrointestinal tract diagnosis group ac-
counted for 51.23% of the primary diagnoses seen in this co-
hort. Other groups with large numbers of patients were the
hepato-pancreatic-biliary group (20.95%) and the soft tissue
group (12.19%). There were less than or equal to 10 patients in
ourcohortwhowerecategorizedundertheresuscitationgroup,
and they were not included in further analyses.
Readmission Rates and Risk Factors for Readmission
The overall 30-day readmission rate for the cohort was 5.91%.
When we examined readmission rates in the different diag-
nosis groups, the rates ranged from 4.11% (upper gastrointes-
tinal tract ) to 16.75% (cardiothoracic). Readmission rates for
other diagnosis groups were 5.42% hepato-pancreatic-
biliary,7.19%softtissue,10.59%intestinalobstruction,10.90%
colorectal, 11.05% hernia, 14.45% general abdominal, and
15.24% vascular (Figure).
There were marked differences in readmission rates based
onpatientdemographicsandadmissioncharacteristics.Higher
readmission rates were seen in patients 65 years and older
(10.59%), black patients (11.01%), and patients with high Charl-
sonComorbidityIndexscores(17.11%)comparedwithotherpa-
tients (Table 2). Patients with lengths of stay less than 4 days
(4.12%)andthosewhoweredischargedhome(5.01%)hadrela-
tively lower readmission rates compared with other groups of
patients.
On multivariate analyses, independent risk factors for re-
admission were having a Charlson Comorbidity Index score of
2 or greater (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.26 [95% CI, 2.14-
2.39]),beingdischargedagainstmedicaladvice(aOR:2.24[95%
CI,1.89-2.66]),hospitalstaygreaterthan7days(aOR:2.10[95%
CI, 1.96- 2.26]), and public insurance (aOR: 1.55 [95% CI, 1.47-
1.64]). Being black (aOR: 1.38 [95% CI, 1.15-1.65]) and being
discharged to any type of posthospitalization care facility
(aOR:1.80[95%CI,1.50-2.16])werealsoassociatedwithhigher
readmission rates, but sex did not play a role in readmissions
(aOR: 1.10 [95% CI, 0.98-1.23]).
Readmission rates in patients in each of the diagnosis
groups, after adjusting for factors that were associated with
readmission, are shown in Table 3. The rates were generally
lowerinpatientsyoungerthan65yearsthaninpatients65years
and older. The rates ranged from 5.04% (upper gastrointesti-
naltract)to11.87%(vascular)amongthepatientsyoungerthan
65 years and 8.70% (hepato-pancreatic-biliary) to 15.50% (vas-
cular) in the patients 65 years and older.

gastrointestinal illnesses (11.67%). For patients 65 years and
older, 10.40% were readmitted owing to gastrointestinal ill-
nesses, and 9.27% of readmissions were owing to surgical in-
fections. Older patients were more often readmitted due to
malnutrition, genitourinary, vascular, pulmonary, and cardiac
reasons than patients younger than 65 years (P < .001). Details
of the reasons for readmission are included in the eTable in the
Supplement.
The mean length of stay of readmissions was 5.4 days, and
16.87% of patients had another surgery on readmission. Of
note, 16.80% of the patients were readmitted at a hospital dif-
ferent from the hospital of the index admission. The main fac-
tors associated with readmission at a different hospital were
being discharged against medical advice (aOR: 2.26 [95% CI,
1.61- 3.16]), being discharged to a skilled nursing facility (aOR:
1.80 [95% CI, 1.50 -2.16]), and paying out of pocket (aOR: 1.64
[95% CI, 1.31- 2.05]) (Table 4).
Discussion
Because of the difficulties faced in characterizing EGS pa-
tients, the readmission rates of this group of patients have not
previously been well described. The American Association for
the Surgery of Trauma’
s initiative toward recognizing emer-
gency general surgery as a potential surgical subspecialty was
an important step toward benchmarking surgical care for these
patients.24 Our study found that 5.91% of EGS patients were re-
admitted within 30 days of discharge and that there was a wide
variation in the readmission rates observed, depending on the
admitting diagnoses of the patients. Variations in readmission
rates based on the admitting diagnosis have previously been
shown in surgical patients treated nonemergently.22,28 To our
knowledge, this is the first study that provides estimates of re-
admissionratesinawell-characterizedandrepresentativegroup
of EGS patients. It is also the first study to describe readmis-
sionratesandcharacteristicsofdistinctdiagnosisgroupsofEGS

patients and indicates that hospital comparisons based on re-
admission rates should consider the type and volume of EGS to
appropriately risk adjust.
Previous studies suggest that the characteristics of the pa-
tients seen at hospitals influence the readmission rates of such
hospitals.16,29,30 We found that EGS patients who were on pub-
licinsurance,hadhighercomorbiditystatus,hadlongerlengths
of hospital stay, and had discharge dispositions other than
home were more likely to be readmitted within 30 days. This
pattern has also been seen with readmissions in elective sur-
gical patients.20 Despite the fact that some of these factors are
not modifiable, they serve as markers for high-risk patients in
whommoreaggressiveapproachestomanagementareneeded,
with an aim of reducing unwanted outcomes such as readmis-
sions. Improving follow-up care, increasing the acceptability
of outpatient treatment for appropriate conditions, and en-
suring patient stability before discharge are potent strategies
to reduce readmissions in high-risk patients.28
In addition to identifying high-risk patients, understand-
ing the reasons for readmission among EGS patients provides
an avenue for proactive intervention. Much work has gone into
delineating the causes of readmission among patients.31-35 Sur-
gical readmissions are multifactorial but often occur as a re-
sult of postoperative complications and infections.10 We found
that the major reasons for readmission were different for those
patients younger than 65 years compared with those 65 years
and older. Among patients younger than 65 years, the most
common reason for readmissions was surgical infections, ac-
counting for 20.47% of their readmissions, while this only ac-
counted for 9.27% of readmissions among patients 65 years
and older. Ten percent of readmissions among both age groups
were due to gastrointestinal complications. Previous studies
have shown that the major driver for readmission differs be-
tween medical and surgical patients because surgical pa-
tientsaremoreoftenreadmittedforsurgicalcomplicationsand
medical patients are more often readmitted for an underly-
ing medical condition.10,36 It has been asserted that a major
differentiating factor for surgical patients is that patients un-
dergoing planned surgical procedures have an opportunity to
undergo medical optimization, reducing the risk of readmis-
sion for medical causes.10 Unlike patients who undergo elec-
tive procedures, EGS patients do not have the opportunity to
be properly optimized before surgery, which places them at an
additive risk for readmission both from the surgical proce-
dure and from their underlying conditions.
Some of the gains demonstrated from the National Sur-
gical Quality Improvement Program include reduced com-
plication rates in participating institutions.37,38 Reducing

complication rates should result in a consequent reduction in
readmission rates. However, there should be corresponding ef-
fortstoincorporatecareforpatients’underlyingconditionsand
prevention of potential medical complications to reduce over-
all readmission rates among EGS patients.
The debate about whether measuring readmission rates is
an appropriate metric of surgical quality has been a heated one
with divergent views.11,39 One of the major arguments against
this measure is that many patients develop complications af-
ter discharge, which affects the ability of readmission rates to
accurately measure the quality of care received during the ad-
mission. Furthermore, same-hospital readmissions, which is
the method commonly used to measure readmissions, does
not adequately capture hospital readmissions, as many pa-
tients get readmitted to different hospitals.40 We found that
16.80% of readmitted patients were readmitted at hospitals
other than where their procedures were performed. These pa-
tients were more likely to have left the index hospital against
medical advice, be on public insurance, or be uninsured. The
evidence from a nationwide cohort of patients points to the
fact that the outcomes of surgical patients readmitted at dif-
ferent hospitals are significantly worse than those readmit-
ted to the same hospital.41 This indicates that hospitals that
have a high retention rate for their readmissions (low level of
fragmentation of care) may ultimately have better patient out-
comes but may have worse ratings when using readmissions
as a quality measure.
There were a few limitations to this study that should be
considered. First, we used an administrative database that was
able to capture greater than 98% of all hospital readmission
in the state but did not have clinical data. This absence of clini-
cal data limited our ability to identify other possible risk fac-
tors that may be associated with readmission based on previ-
ous studies.42 We also were not able to capture the hospital
characteristics of the index or readmitting hospitals, which
have been shown to be associated with readmissions.22 While
these factors may play significant roles in patterns of readmis-
sion, our objective was to outline patient risk factors for read-
mission. Further investigation of readmission that incorpo-
rates hospital data would be useful for the creation of adequate
strategies to reduce hospital readmissions.
Conclusions
With this study, we have been able to characterize the
demographics of EGS patients and identify a representative
group of surgical procedures that EGS patients commonly
undergo. We have also identified patient-level risk factors
for readmission to the index hospital and to other hospitals.
Reducing readmissions is a noble cost-saving goal with ben-
efits not only to the hospitals, but also to the patients. How-
ever, it is critical to understand the underlying factors
associated with readmission to appropriately identify
quality-improvement measures that address the true prob-
lem. Focused and concerted efforts should be made to
incorporate readmission-reducing strategies into the care
of EGS patients, particularly among those at higher risk for
readmission.
