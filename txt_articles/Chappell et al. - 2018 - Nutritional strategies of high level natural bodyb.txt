Abstract
Background: Competitive bodybuilders employ a combination of resistance training, cardiovascular exercise,
calorie reduction, supplementation regimes and peaking strategies in order to lose fat mass and maintain fat free
mass. Although recommendations exist for contest preparation, applied research is limited and data on the contest
preparation regimes of bodybuilders are restricted to case studies or small cohorts. Moreover, the influence of
different nutritional strategies on competitive outcome is unknown.
Methods: Fifty-one competitors (35 male and 16 female) volunteered to take part in this project. The British Natural
Bodybuilding Federation (BNBF) runs an annual national competition for high level bodybuilders; competitors must
qualify by winning at a qualifying events or may be invited at the judge’s discretion. Competitors are subject to
stringent drug testing and have to undergo a polygraph test. Study of this cohort provides an opportunity to
examine the dietary practices of high level natural bodybuilders. We report the results of a cross-sectional study of
bodybuilders competing at the BNBF finals. Volunteers completed a 34-item questionnaire assessing diet at three
time points. At each time point participants recorded food intake over a 24-h period in grams and/or portions.
Competitors were categorised according to contest placing. A “placed” competitor finished in the top 5, and a
“Non-placed” (DNP) competitor finished outside the top 5. Nutrient analysis was performed using Nutritics software.
Repeated measures ANOVA and effect sizes (Cohen’s d) were used to test if nutrient intake changed over time and
if placing was associated with intake.
Results: Mean preparation time for a competitor was 22 ± 9 weeks. Nutrient intake of bodybuilders reflected a
high-protein, high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet. Total carbohydrate, protein and fat intakes decreased over time in
both male and female cohorts (P < 0.05). Placed male competitors had a greater carbohydrate intake at the start of
contest preparation (5.1 vs 3.7 g/kg BW) than DNP competitors (d = 1.02, 95% CI [0.22, 1.80]).
Conclusions: Greater carbohydrate intake in the placed competitors could theoretically have contributed towards
greater maintenance of muscle mass during competition preparation compared to DNP competitors. These findings
require corroboration, but will likely be of interest to bodybuilders and coaches.

 Background
In competitive bodybuilding, athletes are judged on their
muscularity (muscle size), conditioning (the absence of
body fat) and symmetry (muscular proportion). In order
to achieve the required physique, athletes undertake fat
loss regimes, whilst attempting to maintain lean body
mass (LBM) accrued prior to the fat loss period [1, 2].
Athletes and their coaches use a combination of resist-
ance training, cardiovascular exercise, calorie restriction,
supplementation and peaking strategies in order to
obtain a competition-ready physique [3]. Bodybuilders
preparing for competition usually follow self- or coach-
prescribed diets, which often are comprised of a limited
and repetitive food regime, with the sole aim of supply-
ing specific amounts of protein, fat and carbohydrate
[3–8]. Following these stringent dietary approaches is
common practice and connects with the notion of being
“hardcore” celebrated amongst bodybuilders [9]. Al-
though broad recommendations exist for both nutrient
intakes and exercise prescription [10–12], these recom-
mendations are theoretical, imprecise, and open to inter-
pretation. There is also a paucity of applied research on
high level bodybuilders.
Recently a meta-analytic study combined 18 separate
studies on the dietary intake of bodybuilders [13]. This
study reported that male competitors consumed on aver-
age 3292 kcal per day during contest preparation, with
52% of that energy coming from carbohydrate, 28% from
protein, and 22% from fat. Female competitors by way of
comparison consumed 1739 kcal per day with 59% en-
ergy from carbohydrate, 28% energy from protein and
12% energy from fat. Although the meta-analysis incor-
porated 385 participants, the majority of the studies
were published in the 1980s and 1990s and were non-
specific about participants’ phase of training, which may
be ‘off-season’ (prior to beginning contest preparation),
during contest preparation (often a period of 8–24 weeks
before competition), or 1 week from competition (the
immediate pre-contest or peaking phase). The frequent
use of androgenic anabolic steroids (AAS) amongst com-
petitive bodybuilders also confounds identification of op-
timal nutritional strategies and training regimes. Indeed
one third of the studies included in the meta-analysis
reported AAS use by athletes [13]. Furthermore, the
practices employed by athletes in the new physique cat-
egories, such as men’s physique, figure/ athletic, sports/
fitness and swimsuit/bikini, which emphasize beauty ra-
ther than muscularity have not been scrutinised. More-
over, the lack of scrutiny of the practices employed
within the aforementioned divisions may mislead body-
builders as to what are the most effective strategies for
competitive bodybuilding.
Within the United Kingdom (UK), the British Natural
Bodybuilding Federation (BNBF) runs nine regional
qualifying competitions; the regional qualifiers culminate
in a UK final championship, where the overall winner is
awarded professional status. This cohort provides an ex-
cellent opportunity to study the nutritional practices of a
high level group of natural bodybuilders. The strategies
employed by the most successful natural bodybuilders
can be compared to recommendations [11], which in-
clude protein intake of between 2.3 and 3.1 g/kg of
LBM, fat intake of 15 to 30% of total calories, with the
remaining calories from carbohydrate and a weekly
weight loss of 0.5 to 1% of bodyweight (BW) [11]. Here
we report the results of a recent cross-sectional study in-
vestigating the nutritional strategies of natural body-
building competitors at the BNBF finals.
Methods
Design
Both male and female bodybuilders participating in the
BNBF finals were included in the study. All competitors
qualified for the UK final competition by winning their re-
spective weight or age class at a regional qualifying event
or were invited at the judge’s discretion; providing they
had also been placed in the top three of their weight/ age
category. All qualifying class winners were subject to drug
testing based on urine analysis; targeted drug testing of
other non-placed athletes was also carried out. Further-
more, all class winners at the final BNBF final were subject
to the same drug testing criteria, and all competitors
signed a waiver declaring their compliance with the World
Anti-Doping Agency Code [14, 15]. A certified WADA la-
boratory (The Sports Medicine Research and Testing La-
boratory, Salt Lake City, USA) carried out all drug testing.
A qualified polygrapher polygraphed all competitors prior
to taking part in the competition as an additional method
to verify natural status.
The study was advertised via the BNBF social media
page, and registered competitors were recruited in per-
son by the first author at the outset of the UK finals. All
potential participants were fully informed of the study
aims and methods via a participant information sheet;
those agreeing to participate provided written informed
consent. Participants then completed a 34-item ques-
tionnaire (see Additional file 1). The questionnaire in-
quired about dietary and training habits, and body
weight change at three time points throughout contest
preparation (start, middle and end). Participants retro-
spectively recorded their typical food intake over a 24-h
period in grams and/or portions. Missing questionnaire
data and clarification about foods consumed/portions
were followed up via email. The questionnaire also in-
cluded items relating to the regular use of a coach, and
“Cheat Meal” consumption. A “Cheat Meal”, is when
competitors veer from their self- or coach-prescribed
diet. Refeeds are strategies where competitors consume

 a known amount of energy in addition to their pre-
scribed dietary intake, in the belief that it increases
metabolic rate based on information from popular mag-
azines and websites [16].
Results are reported separately for the male and fe-
male cohort as well as for participants who placed in
the top 5 (placed) and those who were placed out of
the top 5 of their class (Did Not Place (DNP)). All
male competitors were from the bodybuilding cat-
egory, while the female competitors were recruited
from the bodybuilding, athletic and figure classes.
Both the athletic and figure class emphasises less
muscularity than female bodybuilding, with bodyfat
levels distinguishing the two categories: lower (ath-
letic) or higher (figure) bodyfat.
Participant characteristics
Competitors reported their offseason (prior to starting
their contest preparation) and competition (the day prior
to taking part in the competition) bodyweights. Total
weight loss and percentage weight loss were calculated
as the difference between the start and end body weight.
Body Mass Index (BMI) (kg/m2) was calculated from
self-reported height and end body weight, body fat per-
centage (BF%) and method used to estimate was based
on self-reported accounts. Only competitors who re-
ported a BF% measured using callipers (n = 9) were in-
cluded in the calculation of mean BF% and fat free mass
index (FFMI) [17]. The FFMI was calculated based on
the estimated fat free mass (FFM) at the end point of
the contest preparation and expressed as kg/m2,.
Dietary analysis
Nutritional analysis of contest diets was performed using
the Nutritics Nutrition Analysis Software (version 4.267
Academic Edition, Nutritics, Dublin, Ireland). Macronu-
trient intake in grams per kg of bodyweight per day (g/
kg BW) and energy intake in kilocalories per kg of body-
weight (kcal/kg BW) was calculated for the start and end
of the diet period, based on competitors’ self-reported
bodyweight. Macronutrients from dietary supplements
were included in the analysis based on manufacturer’s
specifications from brand websites. The mean number of
food items consumed by a competitor at each phase of
preparation was counted. The percentage of the diet
made up of specific food groups was based on the Euro-
pean Food Safety Agency food classification system for
dietary reporting [18]. Any food group making up less
than 1% of the dietary intake was placed in the other in-
gredients category. Beverages, including water, teas and
coffees were excluded from the food group analysis.
Consumption of sugary soft drinks was not reported by
any competitor and so do not feature in this analysis.
Supplements
Supplements were split into 12 different categories
reflecting those most commonly utilised by competitors:
“Multivitamin”, “Vitamin C”, “Vitamin D”, “Mineral or
Joint Supplement”, “Omega 3”, “Pre-Workout”, “Protein
Powder”, “Branch Chain Amino Acids (BCAA)”, “Creat-
ine supplement (either directly or part of another sup-
plement)”,
“Individual
Amino”,
“Fat
Burners”
and
“Miscellaneous” (supplements used too infrequently to
be awarded their own category).
Statistical analysis
Data analysis was performed using the statistical analysis
package IBM SPSS (version 24). Successful bodybuilders
(placed) and unsuccessful bodybuilders (DNP) were
compared for dietary intake (total energy intake (kcal
per day), and total nutrient intake (g per day), using a re-
peated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Energy
and nutrient intake adjusted for bodyweight (kcal/kg
BW; g/kg BW) was log-transformed to account for
skewed data and was then analysed by repeated mea-
sures ANOVA. The effect of time, contest place and
time ⨯ contest place was examined. Mauchly’s test of
sphericity was applied to data to examine if sphericity
was violated and if this was the case the Greenhouse-
Geisser estimate was utilised. For ease of interpretation
we report the data as energy and nutrient intake ad-
justed for bodyweight. Hypothesis testing for categorical
variables was performed using a Pearson Chi-Square for:
contest outcome (placed and DNP), use of coaching and
consumption of “Cheat Meals”. Independent T-Tests
were used to identify if contest outcome (placed and
DNP) was related to: i) years training, ii) years compet-
ing, iii) starting weight, iv) end weight, v) weight loss, vi)
% weight loss, vii) weeks dieting, viii) weight loss per
week, ix) caffeine intake, x) number of meals, and xi)
fluid intake. Statistical significance was declared where
P < 0.05 and the null hypothesis was rejected. Cohen’s d
practical significance was calculated for the effect of
contest outcome (placed and DNP) on energy and
macronutrient intakes for male bodybuilders (as opposed
to the multiple female competitive classes) for g/kg BW,
and kcal/kg BW. Pooled standard deviations were used
to calculate Cohen’s d and effect sizes were multiplied
by an adjustment factor 0.975, to correct for bias to pro-
duce d. Effect size cut-offs were defined as 0.2, 0.5, and
0.8 for small, medium and large effect sizes respectively.

 category, while female competitors were from 3 separate
categories: bodybuilding (n = 3), figure (n = 9) and ath-
letic (n = 4). The female categories were pooled for ana-
lysis. One male competitor was excluded due to failing
the pre-competition polygraph. The cohort included 6
competitors who had competed in a world amateur
championship (4 of whom were former world amateur
champions). The cohort also included 4 competitors
who had previously placed at a BNBF UK final, 3 com-
petitors who had won a regional overall BNBF title and
14 who had previously won a class at a BNBF regional
qualifier. Complete dietary and training information was
available for 32 male and 15 female competitors.
The majority of the competitors (66.7% men, and
88.0% women) used a coach for guidance with training,
nutrition, posing and feedback on their physique. Male
competitors who were placed did not differ from those
DNP in use of a coach (60.0% versus 59.1% respectively)
(χ2 (1) 0.550, P = 0.46). There was also no difference (χ2
(1) 0.163, P = 0.69) in the employment of a coach
amongst female competitors who placed (100.0%) and
DNP (78.0%). Participant characteristics, including age,
years training and competing, bodyweight at the start of
contest preparation and length of time following a diet
are presented in Table 1.
Body composition estimation
Ten male and 5 female competitors provided a self-
reported BF% along with the method they used to esti-
mate/calculate it. Skin callipers were the most popular
method of assessment with 53% of competitors (5 male
and 4 female) using this method. Thirteen percent of
competitors estimated BF% by looking in the mirror,
while the method employed by the remaining 34% was
not
stated. Competitors did not
specifically report
whether a trained professional performed the skin calli-
per tests. An estimate of FFMI was calculated for male
and female competitors who reported BF% measured by
callipers. The estimated FFMI for placed males was
22.74 ± 2.55 kg/m2, with two competitors exceeding
25.0 kg/m2. In female competitors, the mean estimated
FFMI was 18.1 ± 1.95 kg/m2.
Dietary intake
Macronutrients, and diet diversity
The mean macronutrient and energy intakes reported as
g/kg BW and kcal/kg BW at the start and end of contest
preparation are presented in Table 2. Macronutrient and
energy intakes presented as medians and interquartile
ranges, are provided as an additional file (see Add-
itional file 2). Analysis of log-transformed energy and
nutrient intake adjusted for bodyweight indicated no sig-
nificant difference in protein, carbohydrate, fat and en-
ergy intakes between placed and DNP competitors.
Amongst both male and female competitors there was a
significant decrease in energy intake over time (Male
P < 0.001, Female P = 0.01), while there was also a non-
significant decrease in carbohydrate intake over time
amongst male competitors (P = 0.054). Results of the
Cohen’s d adjusted effect size testing for macronutrient
and energy intake scaled to bodyweight indicated a small
to medium effect on competitive outcome for g/kg BW
protein, in male competitors who placed compared to
DNP (d = start 0.49, 95% CI [− 0.25, 1.30], end 0.60, 95%
CI [− 0.15, 1.37]). A similar outcome was noted for
carbohydrate intake between males who placed and
DNP (d = start 1.02, 95% CI [0.22, 1.80], end 0.35, [−
0.40, 1.10]). Small effect sizes were noted for both fat as

Mean macronutrient and energy intakes reported as
total g per day and kcal per day for the start, middle and
end of contest preparation are presented in Table 3.
Total carbohydrate, fat and energy intakes significantly
declined over time (P < 0.05) in both the female and
male groups, while there was a non-significant decrease
in protein intake (P = 0.09) amongst male competitors.
The mean number of food items consumed by male
competitors was: start 11.5 ± 3.6, middle 9.7 ± 4.7, and
end 10.0 ± 3.5. Amongst female competitors the mean
number of food items consumed was: start 12.3 ± 3.4,
middle 13.2 ± 4.0, and end 10.6 ± 3.9. The contribution
of different food groups to the competitors’ diets is pre-
sented in Table 4. No competitor reported consuming
composite diet dishes, food imitates (meat and dairy al-
ternatives), sugar sweetened beverages or alcohol at any
time point during their preparation.
Competitors frequently used supplements over the
course of contest preparation; these data are presented
in Table 5. The consumption of caffeine, fluids and
number of meals a competitor consumed were com-
pared between placed and DNP competitors. There was
no statistically significant difference (t (25) = 0.51, P =
0.62) in daily caffeine consumption between males who
placed (360 ± 198 mg) and DNP (283 ± 153 mg). There
was also no difference (t (13) = 0.80, P = 0.44) in daily
caffeine consumption between females who placed (277
± 158 mg) and DNP (232 ± 173 mg). Mean daily caffeine
consumption was 322 ± 176 (range 0 to 1384 mg) and
252 ± 161 (range 0 to 618 mg) mg per day for males and
females respectively. Fluid intake for males who placed
and DNP place was 4.5 ± 1.7 and 4.5 ± 1.6 l per day, with
no difference between the groups (t (31) = 0.90, P =
0.37). In females the fluid consumption was 4.4 ± 2.3 and
3.8 ± 1.1 l per day, with no significant difference between
the two groups (t (14) = 0.61, P = 0.55). Mean consump-
tion of fluids for males and females was 4.5 ± 1.6 and
4.1 ± 1.7 l per day respectively.
The number of daily meals consumed by competitors
was counted, there was a trend (χ2 (5) 2.40, P = 0.10) for
males who placed to consume more meals per day than
those who DNP, 6.5 ± 0.9 vs 5.9 ± 1.1 respectively. There
was no significant difference (χ2 (2) 0.93, P = 0.23) in the
number of meals consumed per day between females who
placed and DNP, (6.1 ± 0.7 vs 6.7 ± 0.8). The mean number
of meals consumed per day was 6.2 ± 1.0 and 6.4 ± 0.8 for
male and females respectively. Of the 32 male competi-
tors, 10 (31.2%) reported the consumption of “Cheat
Meals”. “Cheat Meal” consumption was less common
amongst placed competitors with only 3 (20.0%) stating
they used “Cheat Meals”, while 7 (38.0%) of DNP competi-
tors reported consuming a “Cheat Meal”. A single placed
competitor (5.0%) reported utilising a refeed strategy.
There was no difference in “Cheat Meal” consumption be-
tween males who placed and DNP (χ2 (2) 2.82, P = 0.28).
Of the 16 female competitors, 8 (50.0%) consumed a
“Cheat Meal” during contest preparation. Reports of
“Cheat Meal” consumption were less frequent amongst
competitors who placed, 1 (6.3%) compared to those who
DNP, 3 (18.8%), while 1 placed (6.3%) competitor and 3
DNP (18.8%) competitors specified employing refeed
strategies. However there was no significant difference be-
tween the groups (χ2 (2) 2.62, P = 0.19).
Discussion
This study is novel in providing insight on the nutri-
tional
strategies
of
high-level
competitive
natural
bodybuilders. Although other studies have claimed to
recruit high-level or elite natural bodybuilders, their
definition of elite has been less stringent than the
present investigation [3, 5]. We found no significant
difference in dietary intake between the placed and

 DNP competitors. In spite of this null effect, results
of practical significance testing suggest carbohydrate
consumption in the early stages of contest prepar-
ation may influence competitive outcome in the male
bodybuilders. We also report that high level natural
bodybuilders consume more energy, particularly from
carbohydrate than previous accounts of natural body-
builders [3–8]. As bodybuilders approached competi-
tion, energy intake is reduced primarily through a
reduction in carbohydrate and fat intake, with protein
intake remaining constant throughout contest prepar-
ation. Accounts of body composition measurement
show
that
bodybuilders
often
employ
subjective
methods to estimate BF% [17]. Finally, we report on
supplement and caffeine intake and note high con-
sumption compared to publicly prescribed safety rec-
ommendations for caffeine.
Body composition and the fat free mass index
Skin callipers were the most commonly used methods
for estimating BF% amongst competitors, while subject-
ive methods based on appearance were also reported.
Objective measurements of BF% from competitive body-
builders have been reported previously; these data sug-
gest ranges from 4.1 to 10.9% and 8.6 to 11.3% in males
and females respectively [2, 6–8, 19–21]. Interestingly in a
sport concerned with achieving a low body fat, the majority
of competitors did not report BF%, with a proportion using
visual methods to estimate BF%. It is possible that the lack
of reporting of BF% may reflect a greater emphasis placed
on the appearance of low body fat in bodybuilding rather
than objectively obtained measures.
A FFMI above 25 kg/m2 is suggested as an upper limit
for muscle accretion, without the use of AAS [16]. This
threshold, however, is based on photographic estimates

 of pre 1959 Mr. America bodybuilders and the objective
measurement of 157 gymnasium users so should be
interpreted with some caution [17]. We provided an esti-
mate of the mean FFMI based on competitors who re-
ported BF% using callipers of 22.7 kg/m2, this is higher
than the 21.8 kg/m2 reported in the study of gymnasium
users [16]. Interestingly, two male competitors in this
study had a FFMI above the 25 kg/m2, (25.73 and
25.15 kg/m2) natural threshold based on the pre 1959
Mr. America winners. We did not measure FFM or BF%
directly and we acknowledge the limitations of self-
reported accounts of BF%; however, it is not inconceiv-
able that there are high-level natural bodybuilders who
exceed this theoretical FFMI 25.0 kg/m2 threshold. The
mean FFMI of 18.1 kg/m2 reported in females was in
agreement with previous estimates of 18.3 kg/m2 [21].
but greater than that of a recent case report [6]. No
FFMI upper threshold has been proposed for females;
however, a FFMI between 19.0 to 20.0 kg/m2 seems a
reasonable objective starting point based on estimates of
female populations [22].
Dietary intake
Energy intake
As expected energy intake of male and female competitors
was higher at the start of contest preparation compared to
the end. Similar findings have been reported in previous
observations [13, 23, 24]. Competitors reported reducing
energy intake in stages over the course of their prepar-
ation with smaller differences from the start to the middle
and middle to end of the diet. Similar strategies involving
modest reductions in carbohydrate and fat consumption
to facilitate weight loss has been reported elsewhere [4].
In contrast, two case studies of bodybuilders [5, 7] re-
ported a reduction in energy intake between 882 to
1300 kcal/d from the start to the end of the competition
preparation, compared to smaller reductions (554 kcal/d)
in our placed males. Smaller reductions are intended to
counteract metabolic adaptations to dieting, changes in
energy requirements and preservation of LBM [11]. Both
male and female competitors reported a high meal fre-
quency. This may reflect the practical aspects of consum-
ing large volumes of food combined with and belief that
multiple meals may preserve more LBM, while contribut-
ing to greater appetite control [25–27].
Research indicates greater LBM preservation and exer-
cise performance with slower versus faster weight loss, a
0.5 to 1% of BW per week is recommended for natural
bodybuilding [10, 28]. Our cohort reporting dieting for on
average 24.9 and 23.3 weeks in males and females

 respectively, compared to 14 weeks in the study by Robin-
son et al. [5], and 26 weeks in both Rossow et al. [3] and
Kister et al. [4] studies. The weekly weight loss in the
present study was estimated to be 0.46% per week in the
placed males, compared to 0.5 [3], 0.7 [4] and 1.0% [5] in
case studies. Fascinatingly, Petrizzo et al. [7] recently ad-
vocated weight loss of 0.5% BW per week for LBM preser-
vation during natural bodybuilding contest preparation. In
the present investigation, weight loss was 0.46% per week
reflecting this recommendation; it seems likely that slower
weight lost in our placed males may have resulted in
greater preservation of LBM than the DNP males.
Macronutrients
Carbohydrate
Carbohydrate was the most abundant macronutrient con-
sumed across all the phases of the diet, in both male and
female competitors. The majority of carbohydrates came
from cereals, tubers, fruit, and vegetables. Confectionary
items, such as sweets and water-based desserts, legumes
and bread were consumed sparingly during contest prepa-
rations in agreement with previous accounts of bodybuild-
ing menus [5, 7, 29]. Carbohydrate intake was reduced
from the start to the end of contest preparation reflecting
the practice seen in bodybuilding case studies [3–5].
Carbohydrate intake amongst placed males (5.1 g/kg BW)
was similar to a meta-analysis of contest preparation
bodybuilders (4.9 g/kg BW) [13]. However, intake was
higher amongst placed male competitors in the weeks pre-
ceding the competition (end of the diet), 4.6 g/kg BW
compared to previous reports (3.8 g/kg BW) [13]. Intake
was also higher for male competitors compared to three
recent case studies, where mean intakes were between 2.5
to 3.0 g/kg bw over 26 and 28 weeks [3, 4], and 1.2 to
1.4 g/kg bw over 14 weeks [5].
Carbohydrate energy in the female cohort (placed and
DNP Start of diet: 3.7 and 4.0 g/kg BW), was higher than
two case studies (3.4 g/kg BW [6] and 1.5 to 1.9 g/kg
BW [7]) and a meta-analysis conducted on studies
reporting
intake
amongst
female
bodybuilders
over
30 years ago (3.1 g/ kg BW) [13]. Higher intakes have
been reported in a recent case report of a dieting female
physique competitor where intake was initially 5.0 g/kg
BW [8] before decreasing to 1.8 g/kg BW by the end of
the 6 month study period. Intakes of 5.0 g/kg BW have
been reported in the final week of contest preparation,
[13] which may reflect carbohydrate loading strategies in
the final week of competition.
Carbohydrate intake amongst the placed males (4.6 to
5.1 g/kg BW) was in line with previous recommenda-
tions of 4–7 g/kg BW for bodybuilders aiming to main-
tain weight [30]. Cohens d effect size testing indicated
carbohydrate intake at the start of the diet may have
some impact on competitive outcome. Placed males
consumed 1.0 to 1.4 g/kg BW more carbohydrate than
those who DNP during this period. This equates to an
additional 75 to 97.5 g carbohydrate (281.2 to 365.6 kcal)
per day in a 75 kg male. This additional carbohydrate is
a non-trivial amount as even modest resistance training
protocols can deplete muscle glycogen concentrations
between 24 to 82% [31, 32]. Furthermore, as little as
15 g of carbohydrate consumed during resistance train-
ing may increase performance in hypertrophy rep ranges
[33]. Finally, the effect of isometric contractions on
bodybuilders’ muscle glycogen concentrations should be
considered. Bodybuilders routinely hold isometric con-
tractions for between 6 to 60s for 10 to 30 min In prep-
aration for competition [8]. By way of comparison
10 min of isometric exercise at 20% of maximum volun-
tary contraction for 10 s, with 10 s rest intervals can se-
verely deplete muscle glycogen in type 1 fibres [34]. An
adequate carbohydrate intake during contest preparation
to maintain muscle glycogen should therefore be an im-
portant consideration for the natural bodybuilder.
Low carbohydrate diets are effective for weight loss,
however they may result in a disproportionate loss of
LBM [35–38]. An example of this can be seen in the
study by Robinson et al. [5] where the athletes lost 43%
of their LBM following a low carbohydrate diet. While
higher carbohydrate diets utilised by other bodybuilding
case studies resulted in smaller LBM loss, 21% and 32%
[3, 4]. Multiple factors could have contribute to the
LBM loss seen in Robinson et al. [5], however recent cri-
tiques have suggested more prudent dietary strategies
should be employed for natural bodybuilding [7, 39].
Interestingly, the two female athletes involved in the
Petzzaro et al. [7] and Rohrig et al. [8] case reports in-
creased LBM and reduced fat mass in despite following
a similar dietary approach to Robinson et al. [5]. With
the exception of a case report which tracked the body
composition of 6 physique athletes (4 male, 2 female)
using AAS [40] increases in LBM and a reductions in fat
mass amongst bodybuilders during contest preparations
have been previously unreported [1, 3–6, 21, 41–43]. In
spite of this finding evidently, there may be a threshold
for carbohydrate intake, after which there is an increase
in the rate of LBM loss regardless of protein intake or
resistance training.
Protein
Protein constituted between 32.0 to 40.0% of total energy
in both male and female competitor’s diets in the present
study in line with previously reported data [12]. The main
protein sources were from dairy, white meat, nuts and sea-
food in agreement with data from previous bodybuilding
studies [5, 6, 29]. The high intake of protein from dairy re-
flects the prominence of protein powder in competitors’
diets. Red meat and eggs were consumed to a lesser extent
Chappell et al. Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition  (2018) 15:4 
Page 8 of 12
 than the aforementioned foods options. Protein intakes
were between 2.7 g/kg BW and 3.3 g/kg BW amongst
male and female competitors, similar to reports from case
studies 2.2 to 3.5 g/kg BW [3–8].
The prioritisation of protein over other macronutri-
ents during energy restriction is common practice
amongst bodybuilders [3–8, 40]. High protein diets are
known to spare LBM during energy deficits [43–46],
maintain nitrogen balance and stimulate muscle protein
synthesis (MPS) [47]. Protein is also satiating, which
may improve dietary adherence during energy restriction
[45]. Protein digestion is also known to have the greatest
thermic effect of the three macronutrients. Approxi-
mately 20 to 30% of net energy is lost through dietary
thermogenesis of protein (compared to around 3% for
fat); this extra thermic effect may contribute to add-
itional weight loss [36, 45].
Protein intake recommendations for strength-trained
athletes during energy restriction are 2.0 g/kg BW, with
0.25 to 0.3 g/kg BW during the early recovery phase
after exercise [48]. However, a recent systematic review
has recommended higher levels of between 2.3 to 3.1 g/kg
BW of LBM during severe calorie restriction [49], al-
though this recommendation was based on only two em-
pirical studies [36, 43]. Nevertheless it seems likely that
protein intake amongst the competitors in this study was
adequate for the preservation of LBM. This additional
protein may be advantageous exploiting the thermic
effect of food and satiation offered by additional pro-
tein. However, a recent experimental study found that
additional protein energy was not realised in changes
in body composition [37, 50].
Fat
Fat intake was the lowest amongst the three macronutri-
ents, and like carbohydrate was reduced over time in
favour of maintaining protein. There was a tendency for
competitors in this cohort to favour low-fat diets. Food
selection patterns emphasised this with oils and red and
processed meats making up only a small percentage of
the cohort’s overall diet. Although eggs were commonly
consumed, the yolks were routinely discarded. Nuts and
seeds, along with white meats, marine and cereals were
the most prominent sources of fat in the athletes’ diet.
Moreover, many athletes reported consuming an omega-
3 fatty acid supplement, suggesting athletes favouring a
diet higher in mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids ra-
ther than saturates. Low fat food selection patterns have
previously been reported [29].
The fat intakes recorded in the present study (start of
diet: males 0.8 g/kg BW, females 0.8 g/kg BW) were simi-
lar to previous accounts reported by Spendlove et al. [13]
for male (0.95 g/ kg BW) but higher than previous reports
of female competitive bodybuilders (0.32 g / kg BW).
Despite the seemingly low fat intake accounts as low as
8% of energy have been reported in the bodybuilding lit-
erature [51, 52]. Bodybuilder’s in the present study placed
nutrients in a hierarchy, prioritising protein followed by
carbohydrate for the aforementioned reasons. Low fat di-
ets have however been cited to reduce testosterone con-
centrations during a calorie deficit [53, 54]. However, in a
11 week study of bodybuilders dieting for competition,
plasma testosterone and IGF-1 concentrations decreased,
despite subjects consuming a relatively high fat intake (en-
ergy 25% or (1.18 g / kg BW) [43]. Differentiating between
the effects of fat and energy intake on hormone concen-
trations is clearly a challenge. The intakes recorded in this
study in conjunction with high protein and high carbohy-
drate diets may therefore merit further investigation.
Finally, the low fat intakes seen here may reflect a
paradigm shift between the present day, and the
1980’s and 90’s where the majority observational stud-
ies of bodybuilders were performed [13]. Likewise the
results reported here may also reflect a difference in
approach between British and American bodybuilders,
with all six recent case studies opted for a higher fat
approach [3–8].
Supplementation and caffeine intake
Male and female competitors routinely consumed be-
tween 5 and 7 supplements during contest preparation.
Protein powders, multivitamins, BCAA and creatine were
the most commonly consumed supplements in agreement
with previous observations of gymnasium users, athletes
and bodybuilders [55–57]. Whey protein was routinely
consumed at breakfast and post resistance training. In
contrast, casein-based supplements were commonly con-
sumed as the last meal of the day. The use of protein in
this manner suggests nutrient timing strategies, the effect-
iveness of which has been called into question [58].
Branch chain amino acids are used as means of maximally
stimulating MPS over the course of the day by providing a
bolus dose of BCAA every few hours along with or be-
tween meals, for the preservation of LBM in what is com-
monly referred to as a ‘pulsing strategy’ [47]. However
when the muscle full effect is considered, the use of
BCAA as part of a high protein diet may offer little if any
additional stimulation of MPS [59]. Moreover, the daily
doses of BCAA (30 g) and beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbuty-
rate (2 g), consumed by the athletes in the Kistler et al. [4]
case study failed to prevent a greater loss of LBM com-
pared to Rossow et al. [3].
Specialist fat burning and pre-exercise supplements
were also popular amongst this cohort. Pre-exercise sup-
plements often contained combinations of vitamins,
minerals, amino acids, creatine, caffeine and lactate
buffers usually in the form of beta alanine, citrulline
malate and arginine. The efficacy of these individual
Chappell et al. Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition  (2018) 15:4 
Page 9 of 12
 ingredients have been reviewed for natural bodybuilding
[11]; however, their use in combination is largely un-
known. In addition, because caffeine is a prominent in-
gredient in many of these supplements, competitors
should consider the contribution these supplements
make to their caffeine intake. This point is particularly
pertinent when considering competitors may often con-
sume large amounts of energy drinks and hot beverages
[5–7]. Indeed, several competitors exceeded the 400 mg
per day safety consumption limits specified by The
European Food Safety Agency for caffeine. Although
these consumption limits are based on a 70 kg individ-
ual, competitors should be aware that intakes above
9 mg /kg BW may be ergolytic as well as having unin-
tended side effects [60, 61].
Limitations
There are limitations with the method used to assess
dietary intake, under-reporting of habitual dietary en-
ergy intake is estimated to be between 18 to 54% in
non-bodybuilding populations [62]. In particular carbo-
hydrates tend to be under-reported, while protein in-
take over reported [62]. Likewise, foods that portray a
negative health image such as confectionary are often
under reported while foods that portray a positive
health image such as fruits and vegetables are over re-
ported [62]. The prevalence of under- or over reporting
within bodybuilding population is unknown, however
bodybuilders are known for their strict adherence to
dietary plans [3–8]. The dietary recall only incorporated
a single day’s intake at three arbitrary time points. As a
result, competitors largely reported their dietary intake
for training days, while intake on non-training days is
likely to be lower. This bias likely resulted in inflated
values for energy intake, furthermore strategies such as
carbohydrate and calorie cycling were likely missed by
the single day recall method. Despite the limitations of
the method used to capture dietary intake we were able
to detect a reduction of energy intake over time. More-
over, a single day’s intake may have led to misclassifica-
tion of dietary diversity, although the diet diversity
scores are agreement with previous accounts of body-
building menus.
The BF% values used to estimate the FFMI of competi-
tors are based on self-reported accounts using skin calli-
pers. Competitors did not report if these skinfold test
were carried out by trained professionals. Although, the
values reported were plausible (essentially they match
with the values reported elsewhere amongst competitive
bodybuilders taken form objective measures) for com-
petitors competing in a national competition, we omit-
ted to include them in the report along with the
subjectively obtain values as they should not be regarded
as accurate.
Conclusions
The cross-sectional nature of this study makes it difficult
to draw any definitive conclusion on what may be the
best dietary approaches for contest preparation in nat-
ural bodybuilders. Our questionnaire was limited in
scope and there are multiple variables that likely influ-
ence competitive outcome. Likewise, the sample size
may have reduced our ability to detect statistical signifi-
cance. In spite of these limitations, our study is distinct-
ive in its applied nature attempting to correlate cross
sectional data with competition outcome. The findings
of this study required corroboration, and should be
interpreting with caution. However, it is likely our find-
ings will be of interest to pre-competition bodybuilders
and those seeking to reduce fat mass while maintaining
LBM who may wish to know strategies employed by
bodybuilders in the placed cohort of a high level national
bodybuilding competition.
This study also provides a contemporary account of
current bodybuilding practices and provides additional
evidence for the formation of research informed ap-
proaches to natural bodybuilding contest preparation.
Future studies should focus on the use of standardizes
body composition measurement techniques to assess
changes in FFM during contest preparation. Further-
more, beyond case studies the literature is lacking in
longitudinal studies of competitive bodybuilders. Larger
scale longitudinal studies of competitive natural body-
builders using with frequent sampling points would be
of value to researchers in this field.
