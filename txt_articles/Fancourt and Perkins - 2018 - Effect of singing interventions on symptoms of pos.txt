Effect of singing interventions on
symptoms of postnatal depression:
three-arm randomised controlled trial
D. Fancourt and R. Perkins
Summary
This study assessed whether a novel psychosocial intervention
could reduce symptoms of postnatal depression (PND) in the first
40 weeks post-birth. Analyses were carried out of 134 mothers
with symptoms of PND randomised into 10 weeks of group
singing workshops or group play workshops for them and their
babies, or usual care (trial registration: NCT02526407). Overall,
among all mothers with symptoms of PND, there was a non-
significant faster improvement in symptoms in the singing group
(F4,262 = 1.66, P = 0.16, η2 = 0.012). When isolating mothers with
moderate–severe symptoms of PND, this result became signifi-
cant, with a faster improvement in symptoms in the singing
group (F3.9,139.8 = 2.74, P = 0.033, η2 = 0.028).

Postnatal depression (PND) is characterised by both psychological
and behavioural changes including fatigue, irritability, disturbance
of appetite, insomnia and anhedonia, with 25% of women affected
experiencing symptoms lasting over a year.1 There are several treat-
ment models available to women with symptoms of PND, including
psychotherapy and antidepressants, but there are challenges asso-
ciated with each.1 Consequently, there is a need to identify further
ways of supporting the mental health of new mothers. Given that
studies examining predictors of PND have identified psychosocial
factors such as daily hassles, parenting stress, chronic strain and
both perceived and received social support,2 group interventions
that simultaneously relax mothers and enhance their support net-
works could be of value. In particular, there is theoretical research
suggesting that singing could support new mothers: singing is
widely practised in cultures around the world, with anthropological
theories that singing even evolved with the aim of reassuring infants,
promoting mother–infant bonding and supporting infant neuro-
logical development.3 Further, there have been a number of
studies in different populations showing the benefits of singing
for mental health in older adults,4,5 patients with chronic obstruct-
ive pulmonary disease6 and people with dementia.7 Yet to date,
there have been no controlled studies exploring the effect of
singing on mental health in new mothers; specifically on symptoms
of PND. Therefore, this three-arm parallel-group randomised con-
trolled trial explored the impact of a 10-week community singing
programme for mothers experiencing symptoms of PND and
their babies compared with a comparison group undertaking a
10-week programme of community play activities and a control
non-intervention group (trial registration: NCT02526407).
Method
Participants were adult women with babies up to 40 weeks post-birth
who displayed symptoms of PND, indicated with a score of ≥ 10 on
the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS; a 10-item self-
report measure scored from 0 to 30 with ≥ 10 indicative of possible
depression and higher scores indicating more severe depression).8
They were randomised using SPSS with a 1:1:1 allocation using
random block sizes of six, stratified by age of their child and the
severity of their EPDS score. Women were recruited through mid-
wives, doctors, perinatal psychiatrists, health visitors and general prac-
titioners in the Greater London area, as well as through social media,
leaflets and by a research assistant in children’s centres and in the local
community. The study received ethical approval from the National
Health Service Research Ethics Committee (REC reference 15/SS/
0160) and all participants provided informed consent.
A total of 307 women were screened for participation, of whom
148 were eligible to participate and consented to take part, and 135
completed data collection (see supplementary Fig. 1, available at
http://dx.doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2017.29). One participant reported
not responding to the questions accurately so was retrospectively
excluded, providing a final n of 134 (91% completion rate). There
were no differences across any of the baseline variables measured
between those who did complete and those who did not complete
data collection. Participants were recruited and participated between
December 2015 and August 2016. In the singing group, the median
number of sessions attended was eight (mean 7.2, s.d. = 2.6) and in
the play group, the median number of sessions attended was six
(mean 5.7, s.d. = 2.8).
Participants randomised to the singing (experimental) and cre-
ative play (comparison) groups received weekly free 60 min work-
shops in groups of 8–12 for them and their baby for 10 weeks in a
children’s centre local to them (five groups ran per arm to accom-
modate all participants). Groups were led by professional work-
shops leaders, with the same leaders leading both the singing and
creative play sessions to ensure consistency of person and place
between the two conditions. Singing workshops involved mothers
listening to songs sung by the leader, learning and singing songs
with their babies, and creating new songs together reflecting
aspects
of
motherhood.
Creative
play
workshops
involved
mothers engaging in sensory play with their babies, doing arts
and crafts and playing simple games together. Participants rando-
mised to the control group did not receive any workshops above
and beyond their usual care for 10 weeks but were provided with
singing classes at the end of their research participation as a
thank you. No adverse events were reported across the study.
Participants provided baseline demographic data and com-
pleted the EPDS at baseline, week 6 and week 10. Data were analysed
using IBM SPSS version 23.0. Baseline comparisons using one-way
ANOVAs, Kruskal–Wallis test and Chi-square test for linear,
ordinal and categorical data respectively revealed that groups were
well matched (supplementary Table 1). Changes across time were
measured using two-way repeated measures ANOVAs looking at
the effects across time and the time × group interaction. Given that
there are two recommended levels of EPDS cut-off (EPDS ≥ 10 for

 symptoms of PND and EPDS ≥ 13 indicating more severe depres-
sion; sometimes classed as minor and major PND),9 planned sensi-
tivity analyses were performed parallel to the main analyses using
EPDS ≥ 13.
Results
There was a significant decrease across time in EPDS score, indicat-
ing that women in all three groups experienced improvements in
symptoms of PND across the 10 weeks (EPDS ≥ 10: F2,262 =
143.21, P < 0.001, η2 = 0.52; EPDS ≥ 13: F1.9,139.8 = 118.39, P <
0.001, η2 = 0.60). When considering the time × group interaction,
using EPDS ≥ 10, there was no significant effect (F4,262 = 1.66, P =
0.16, η2 = 0.012). However, using EPDS ≥ 13, the time × group
interaction reached significance (F3.9,139.8 = 2.74, P = 0.033, η2 =
0.028). To explore over which time period this time × group differ-
ence occurred, we looked at the within-participant contrasts, which
showed a significant difference between groups from baseline to
week 6 (EPDS: F2,72 = 3.93, P = 0.024, η2 = 0.05), but showed the
difference between groups narrowing again by week 10 (F2,72 =
0.27, P = 0.76, η2 = 0.001) (Fig. 1). To explore which group differed
across this period of significance, we ran ANOVAs of the change
from baseline to week 6, which confirmed the significant difference
between groups (F2,72 = 3.93, P = 0.024, η2 = 0.10), with post hoc
tests with Bonferroni corrections demonstrating that the singing
group had a significantly faster improvement than the control
group (mean difference −2.83, s.e. = 1.06, 95% CI −5.44 to −0.22,
P = 0.029, d = 0.78) but not the play group (mean difference
−2.03, s.e. = 1.05, 95% CI −4.61 to 0.54, P = 0.17, d = 0.56), with
no difference between the play and control group (mean difference
−0.80, s.e. = 1.13, 95% CI −3.57 to 1.97, P > 0.99, d = 0.20).
Descriptive statistics are provided in supplementary Table 2, and
show that this improvement among the singing group equated to
an average 35% decrease in depressive symptoms across the first 6
weeks by which point 65% of the singing group no longer had an
EPDS ≥ 13. This decrease in depressive symptoms in the singing
group extended to a 40% decrease by week 10, by which point
73% of the singing group no longer had an EPDS ≥ 13. Sensitivity
analyses factoring as covariates whether mothers were also receiving
additional support for their mental health alongside involvement in
the study did not affect the significance of ANOVA results either
across time or for the time × group interaction.
Discussion
This study supports findings from previous studies showing that
symptoms of PND improve over time.10 However, mothers
involved in the singing group had a significantly faster decrease in
their symptoms. Research suggests that children whose mothers
experienced PND have higher rates of insecure attachments and
poor emotional adjustment in the early years, delays in reading
and demonstration of behaviour disturbances and impaired pat-
terns of communication 5 years on.11,12 However, early remission
from PND has been associated with reduced effects on both
mother and baby.12 Consequently, evidence that singing interven-
tions could speed the rate of recovery in women affected by symp-
toms of PND could have clinical relevance.
It is notable that there was no significant difference in speed of
recovery between the play group and controls. This might suggest
that the social support provided by the play group was not enough
in itself to improve symptoms of PND and that there were character-
istics specific to the singing group that played a key role in the
improvements found. However, it is noted that post hoc tests
showed the singing group did not have a significantly faster improve-
ment than the play group, implying that the social support provided
by the play group was, if not an entirely explanatory factor, at least
a factor in the improvements found in the singing group.
Regarding limitations, participants and researchers were not
masked to the groups they were allocated to. However, women
were not informed that the study hypothesis involved singing
having significantly different results to the play group, so the fact
that there were no improvements in the play group compared
with the control would seem to suggest results were not entirely
driven by placebo. Overall, this study suggests that 10-week pro-
grammes of group singing workshops could help speed the recovery
from symptoms of PND among new mothers. Although the study
sample size is in line with previous studies exploring the effects of
interventions for the treatment of PND,13 further work needs to
be undertaken to replicate the findings with a larger sample size
and to ascertain the viability of such workshops in clinical practice.

1968: psychiatry in transition
Lucas Richert
The year 1968 has been described as one that ‘rocked the world’, ‘changed everything’ and ‘made us who we are’. It was
certainly a momentous year for psychiatry. On the semicentennial anniversary, a snapshot of the era helps us under-
stand the present.
If change was afoot, Raymond Waggoner, the new head of the American Psychiatric Association, was in touch with the
moment. He asserted in 1968 that his aim was to oversee ‘healthy and wisely determined progress …’. He suggested that
psychiatrists take a more active role in social problems outside the field of psychiatry. Waggoner also promoted new
thinking. With Beyond the Therapeutic Community (1968) and Social Psychiatry in Practice (1968), Maxwell Jones did just
that. He advocated user-led treatment in Britain and the United States that necessitated more equality in the therapeutic
milieu.
Maxwell was operating in a professional environment shaped by such psychiatrists as R.D. Laing, David Cooper, Joseph
Berke and Leon Redler, who produced early critiques of psychiatry. Franz Fanon, the French psychiatrist and philoso-
pher, also published the eighth edition of The Wretched of the Earth in 1968, while Thomas Szasz, another critic, pub-
lished Law, Liberty, and Psychiatry. Erving Goffman added to the list with the second printing of his influential book
Stigma.
Socially conscious psychiatrists in the American Psychiatric Association coalesced during the annual convention in
Boston and underlined issues of war, race, class and gender. They voiced concern about how breakthroughs in military
hardware, advancements in human rights activism and the rising automation of Western civilisation affected the theory
and practice of psychiatry. A year later, the organization’s liberal caucus rebranded itself a ‘radical caucus’.
Drugs were an important part of the era. In 1968, a series of articles in mainstream psychiatry debated the dangers of
cannabis, linking it to psychosis. The American Journal of Psychiatry and Psychiatric News disapproved of its use. The era
of psychedelic medicine drew to a close as well. Authorities in the UK moved against LSD and in 1966 it was made illegal.
Medical use also stopped and was prohibited by the Misuse of Drugs Act when it came into force in 1973. LSD was
banned in the USA in 1968.
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders II was also published in 1968, and it continued to conceptualise
psychopathology from a psychodynamic perspective. Additionally, psychiatrists that year hotly debated the aetiology of
schizophrenia. Numerous causes were advanced: a pathological lesion on the brain; a biochemical origin, such as Emile
Kraepelin’s notion of a metabolic imbalance; a congenital cause; a psychogenic approach, based on psychoanalytic
thought; a sociogenic cause; and, finally, a biopsychosocial (holistic) conceptualisation that had been endorsed by Adolf
Meyer.
The British Journal of Psychiatry, for its part, was engaging with the major debates of the time. The October 1968 issue
evaluated LSD and leucotomy. The August issue devoted several articles to the efficacy and effects of electroconvulsive
therapy. The British Journal of Psychiatry’s focus on these issues, among others, represented not only evolution in
psychiatry but also a free marketplace of ideas.
