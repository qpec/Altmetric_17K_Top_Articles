Cancer cell dissemination during very early stages of breast cancer proceeds through poorly
understood mechanisms. Here we show, in a mouse model of HER2+ breast cancer, that a
previously described sub-population of early-evolved cancer cells requires macrophages for
early dissemination. Depletion of macrophages specifically during pre-malignant stages
reduces early dissemination and also results in reduced metastatic burden at end stages of
cancer progression. Mechanistically, we show that, in pre-malignant lesions, CCL2 produced
by cancer cells and myeloid cells attracts CD206+/Tie2+ macrophages and induces Wnt-1
upregulation that in turn downregulates E-cadherin junctions in the HER2+ early cancer cells.
We also observe macrophage-containing tumor microenvironments of metastasis structures
in the pre-malignant lesions that can operate as portals for intravasation. These data support
a causal role for macrophages in early dissemination that affects long-term metastasis
development much later in cancer progression. A pilot analysis on human specimens revealed
intra-epithelial macrophages and loss of E-cadherin junctions in ductal carcinoma in situ,
supporting a potential clinical relevance.

 T
he paradigm of cancer metastasis states that dissemination
and metastasis occur when advanced aggressive tumors
acquire
invasive mechanisms.
The finding
that dis-
semination does not only occur from evolutionary late-stage
invasive tumors has challenged the uniqueness of this model1.
Large cohort patient studies2–5 and studies with spontaneous
mouse tumor models6 showed that dissemination also occurs
during early stages of cancer when lesions are diagnosed by light
microscopy as pre-malignant or pre-invasive. In addition, cancer
of unknown primary is a relatively frequent event in solid cancers
where metastases develop without the presence of an obvious
primary tumor mass that evolved to become invasive7.
The “early dissemination” definition was refined by Husemann
et al.6 when they showed that early disseminated cancer cells
(DCCs) originate at times when lesions are only defined in situ by
light microscopy (e.g., ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in humans
and mammary intra-epithelial neoplasia in mice), but dis-
semination occurs and early DCCs show few genetic aberrations.
Following previous work6, we found that in MMTV-HER2 early
lesions there is a sub-population of HER2+/P-p38lo/P-ATF2lo/
TWISThi/E-cadherinlo disseminating cancer cells that reach dis-
tant organs and initiate metastasis8, 9. Our studies revealed that
HER2+ early cancer cells deregulate mechanisms of motility and
invasion activated during mammary tissue branching morpho-
genesis8, 9. The remarkable finding was that early DCCs are
endowed with latent metastasis-initiating capacity8, 9. Women
treated for DCIS can develop metastases without ever developing
any subsequent local invasive breast cancer10–14. This might
indicate that, albeit at low frequency, early DCCs can unpredic-
tably form metastases in patients. Early dissemination is not a
rarity of breast cancer models (MMTV-HER2 and MMTV-PyMT
models6, 8, 9), as it also occurs in spontaneous mouse models of
melanoma15 and pancreatic cancer16.
The mechanistic analysis of early dissemination has been pri-
marily early cancer cell-centric8, 9. Since early DCCs displayed
fewer genetic alterations than the late DCC counterparts4, 6, 8, and
the mechanism of dissemination resembled steps of mammary
morphogenesis8, 9, we hypothesized that early dissemination
might be driven by micro-environmental mechanisms that con-
trol epithelial cell motility and invasion during mammary tissue
development17, 18.
The mammary epithelium forms post-natally during adoles-
cence in a process called branching morphogenesis where rapidly
dividing epithelial cells elongate the terminal end bud into the fat
pad and bifurcate into the ductal tree. Macrophages are key
regulators of branching morphogenesis during mammary gland
development19, 20, arguing that normal mammary epithelial cells
cooperate with these innate immune cells for invasive processes.
These data led to the discovery of macrophages as powerful
drivers of intravasation from invasive breast cancer tumors via
the establishment of tumor microenvironments of metastasis
(TMEM)21. This follows a streaming process where breast cancer
cells recruit macrophages through colony-stimulating factor 1
(CSF1) production and then cancer cell motility is stimulated via
macrophage-derived epidermal growth factor (EGF)22. Addi-
tionally, macrophages can induce an epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) in malignant cells23, 24. Elegant studies by
Pollard and colleagues25[,26 have also shown that macrophages
play key roles in the maintenance of lung metastasis. However,
the role of macrophages in the process of dissemination during
evolutionary early stages of breast cancer progression remained
unexplored.
Here we show that the branching morphogenesis program is
altered by oncogenes early in cancer development. CD206hi
macrophages in the mammary tissue are attracted by early cancer
cells from the stroma into the epithelial layer of lesions defined as
mammary intra-epithelial neoplasia in mice (similar to DCIS in
humans)27. In the MMTV-HER2 model this process depends on
HER2-NF-κB-mediated induction of CCL2. Our data suggest that
intra-epithelial macrophages respond to CCL2, which in turn can
stimulate macrophages to produce Wnt-1, leading to disruption
of E-cadherin junctions between early cancer cells. Before tumors
form, these events result in early dissemination microenviron-
ments that propel active intravasation and dissemination to the
lung, which was efficiently blocked by macrophage depletion.
Transient depletion of macrophages in mice before the formation
of invasive tumors reduced lung metastatic burden later in mice
life. Our results suggest a previously unrecognized role for local
attraction of macrophages from the stroma into the ductal epi-
thelium to favor dissemination of cancer cells much earlier than
growth is induced by the oncogene. Our work also reveals a role
for early DCCs in supporting late metastasis development, which
is agreement with our recent studies supporting that ~79% of
metastases in the MMTV-HER2 model descend from early DCCs.
Results
Macrophages infiltrate Her2+ early lesions. We asked whether
the HER2 oncogene might attract macrophages to orchestrate
early dissemination. We used MMTV-HER2 mice as a murine
model of breast cancer since these show slow progression from
early lesions such as hyperplasia and mammary intra-epithelial
neoplasia (Fig. 1a, b, Supplementary Table 1), the latter a similar
lesion to DCIS27, to invasive tumors (Fig. 1c, Supplementary
Table 1). We stained MMTV-HER2 mammary gland sections for
the murine macrophage marker F4/80 before we could detect any
signs of invasive tumor masses in serial sections of mammary
tissue or even enhanced proliferation in HER2+early lesions28.
Macrophages were located to the stroma outside of mammary
ducts in healthy FVB wild-type (WT) animals (Fig. 1d, Supple-
mentary Table 1). This was also true in young 14-week-old
MMTV-HER2 mice (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Table 1). However,
when MMTV-HER2 mice progressed over time but still showed
no signs of tumor masses or enhanced proliferation28, macro-
phages were often localized inside the luminal epithelial layer of
early lesions as demonstrated by co-staining of F4/80 and cyto-
keratin 8/18 (CK8/18) (Fig. 1f, Supplementary Table 1). We
hypothesized that as macrophages enter the early lesions, they
might disrupt the architecture of the duct. Close inspection of
sections co-stained for α-smooth muscle actin and F4/80 showed
that the myoepithelial cell layer was frequently disrupted at sites
where macrophages were in immediate contact with the duct
(Fig. 1g–i, Supplementary Table 1). Quantification of the abun-
dance of intra-epithelial macrophages confirmed that the inci-
dence of ducts with intra-epithelial macrophages correlated with
HER2 upregulation and disease progression (Fig. 1j, Supple-
mentary Table 1).
Macrophages dismantle E-cadherin junctions in early lesions.

associated with a strong local downregulation of E-cadherin
junctions in vivo in early lesions cells located directly adjacent to
macrophages (1–2 cell diameter away) (Fig. 2a–c, Supplementary
Table 2). This was paralleled by a general downregulation of E-
cadherin mRNA in early lesions compared to WT glands (Fig. 2d,
Supplementary Table 2), which had been reported previously9.

 translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus could also be induced
in vitro when Raw264.7 macrophages were added to Comma-1D
healthy mammary epithelial cell monolayers used as readout for
epithelial junction formation (Fig. 2h–j, m, n, p). The loss of E-
cadherin junctions in epithelial cells adjacent to macrophages
suggested that macrophages might produce cues that stimulate a
loss of E-cadherin junctions as observed during the EMT. Mac-
rophages can produce Wnt ligands29–31 which are potent indu-
cers of an EMT. We therefore tested the response of Raw264.7
macrophages or primary mammary tissue macrophages isolated
from early lesions to conditioned media from healthy epithelial
cells or from HER2+ early cancer cells. Only conditioned media
derived from HER2+ cells induced an upregulation of Wnt-1
(Fig. 2k, l, Supplementary Table 2); no changes were detected for
Wnt-3a upon treatment with the HER2+ cells conditioned media
and Wnt-5a and Wnt-7 were not detectable in either mammary
tissue macrophages or Raw264.7 cells (Supplementary Fig. 1G).
Our published data also showed that Wnt-1 is not produced by
the early lesions8, 9. Comma-1D cells also do not produce Wnt-
132, arguing that macrophages are the main source of Wnt-1.
However, HER2+ early cancer cells do produce other Wnt
ligands8, 9 that could further enhance a Wnt signaling pathway.
The loss of E-cadherin junctions in Comma-1D cells induced by
Raw264.7 macrophages was reversed by the addition of DKK1, an
inhibitor
of
canonical
Wnt
signaling,
to
the
co-cultures
(Fig. 2m–p). Further, Comma-1D cells exposed to conditioned
media from Raw264.7 cells immuno-depleted via precipitation
from Wnt-1 with a specific antibody (Supplementary Fig. 1A, B)
were able to restore E-cadherin junctions, when compared to
immunogobulin G (IgG)-depleted conditioned media that dis-
played marginal E-cadherin junction formation (Supplementary
Fig. 1A, B). Our data support that downregulation of Cdh1
mRNA junctions and β-catenin nuclear translocation in early
lesions cells results from HER2-dependent attraction of Wnt-1-
secreting macrophages from the stroma into the early lesions.
Because HER2+ early cancer cells also produce other Wnt ligands,
we further conclude that the downregulation of E-cadherin
junctions may be due to the combined effect of early cancer cell-
derived and macrophage-derived Wnt ligands.
Macrophages that produce Wnt ligands31 are known to
associate with tumor cells that interact with the TMEM
structures. A TMEM structure is composed of a macrophage, a
MENAhi tumor cell and endothelial cells and serve as the portal
for intravasation21, 33. The presence of macrophages in early
lesions prompted us to test if TMEMs are formed in these HER2
early lesions as found in the PyMT model early lesions21. Using a
clinically validated test33 it was shown that early cancer lesions in
the MMTV-HER2 and MMTV-PyMT21 models were efficiently
forming TMEM (Supplementary Fig. 1C, D). Our data (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1C, D, Supplementary Table 7) reveals that the
HER2+ model also shows formation of TMEM structures which
can operate as portals for intravasation21, 33. These TMEM
structures occur in approximately 10% of ducts at 17 weeks in
MMTV-HER2 animals (Supplementary Fig. 1E, Supplementary
Table 7). This frequency is in range with the frequency of intra-
epithelial macrophages in pre-malignant lesions in Fig. 1j.
Importantly, compared to WT mammary tissue, early lesions in
the MMTV-PyMT model also showed a significant (p ≤ 0.0001,
Mann–Whitney test) downregulation of E-cadherin (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 2A, Supplementary Table 7), arguing that PyMT-
initiated signaling might converge on similar signals as HER2 to
attract macrophages from the stroma into the early lesions and
downregulate
E-cadherin
junctions.

 Macrophage depletion prevents early dissemination. We next
tested whether macrophage mobilization into early lesions where
they induce an EMT in early cancer cells leads to early dis-
semination. CSF1 receptor (CSF1R) is expressed by most tissue-
resident macrophages and is required for macrophages' survival
in tissues35. Thus, we injected MMTV-HER2 mice during early
lesions with a blocking antibody to CSF1R to eliminate macro-
phages from early lesions or as controls with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) or an isotype-matched IgG (Fig. 3a, Supplementary
Fig. 2B, Supplementary Table 7). CSF1R blockade led to the
depletion of tissue-resident CD11b+/F4/80+/Gr1− macrophages
compared to PBS-treated and IgG-treated animals (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 2B, C, Supplementary Table 7). Importantly, IgG control
did not alter the relative or total levels of F4/80+CD11b+ mac-
rophages, CD11b+F4/80neg monocytes or F4/80+CD206hi or F4/
80+CD206lo macrophages. Dendritic cell and neutrophil numbers
and percentages from the CD45+ gate were also not affected by
the IgG (Supplementary Fig. 2C, Supplementary Table 7). CSF1R-
blocking antibody treatment did deplete significantly (p<0.05) the
F4/80+CD206hi macrophage population and monocytes, while
neutrophils and dendritic cells remain unchanged (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 2C, Supplementary Table 7). Quantification of immu-
nofluorescence (IF) staining images for F4/80 in HER2+ early
lesions (Supplementary Fig. 2E, Supplementary Table 7) con-
firmed a significant reduction in the number of intra-epithelial
macrophages when CSF1R was blocked compared to all controls
(Supplementary Fig. 2B, C, and E; p<0.05; Supplementary
Table 7). We confirmed that at the end of the experiment, no
tumor masses had formed, by inspecting whole mounts of

were stained against E-cadherin and F4/80. E-cadherin localization was analyzed dependent on whether macrophages did not make direct contact to the
duct (no M. or distant M.; a) or whether ducts contain IEMs (b). The percentage of individual epithelial cells with disrupted E-cadherin was quantified in
four mice and is shown as mean±SEM (c). Statistical analysis: Mann–Whitney test. E-cadherin mRNA expression in whole mammary glands of FVB wild-
type (WT, 20wks, N = 4) or 20-week-old MMTV-HER2 (N = 7) mice was determined by qPCR and is shown as mean±SEM by Mann–Whitney test. d

 Table 7) and hematoxylin–eosin (H&E) staining of serially sec-
tioned mammary tissue (Fig. 3b, c, Supplementary Table 3).
Macrophage depletion was accompanied by a significant reduc-
tion in the number of hyperplastic ducts (Fig. 3b–g, Supple-
mentary
Table
3,
and
Supplementary
Fig.
2F;
p<0.05;
Supplementary Table 7) and a tissue-wide upregulation of E-
cadherin mRNA (Fig. 3d) and E-cadherin-based junctions com-
pared to PBS (Fig. 3e–g, Supplementary Table 3) or IgG controls
(Supplementary Fig. 2D, Supplementary Table 7). Overall, we
conclude that macrophages contribute to the loss of E-cadherin
mRNA and junctions and disrupted mammary tissue architecture
in early lesions.
The above changes correlated with the finding that CSF1R
blockade significantly (p = 0.019) reduced the number of early
circulating cancer cells (Fig. 3h, Supplementary Table 3).
Accordingly, CSF1R blockade also reduced early DCC burden
in target organs as measured by the detection of the transgene
surface HER2 expressing early DCCs in the lungs (Fig. 3i–k,
Supplementary Table 3). To rule out that HER2+ cells might be
macrophages that engulfed early cancer cells in the mammary
tissue and migrated to the lung, we tested the fraction of cells in
the lungs in MMTV-HER2 animals that might be double positive
for HER2 and macrophage markers (F4/80) (Supplementary
Fig. 3A, Supplementary Table 7). Only ~2 cells per field of view
(FOV) were HER2/F4/80 double positive vs. a median of 46
DCCs/FOV were HER2+/F4/80−. This results in a frequency of
0.04 or 4% of all HER2+ cells being double positive. This argues
that only 4% of HER2+ cells could be confused for a macrophage
engulfing HER2+ cells in the lung or traveling to the lung with the
engulfed cells. We conclude that macrophages play a critical role
in the ability of early cancer cells to acquire an invasive and
disseminating phenotype.
Early dissemination macrophages fuel late metastasis. We next
tested whether macrophage-regulated early dissemination con-
tributed to metastasis formation. To this end, we blocked CSF1R
only during early asymptomatic stages of cancer, starting at age
week 18, and stopped as soon as tumors became palpable (size
<3 mm in diameter). We then waited until tumors reached 1 cm
in diameter (4–6 weeks later) and quantified solitary DCCs and
metastatic lesions in lungs (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Table 4). We
found that the time to tumor detection was slightly delayed when
macrophages were depleted during asymptomatic pre-malignant
stages (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Table 4). However, once palpable
tumors had formed, the progression to overt tumors was not
affected (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Table 4). Additionally, overt
tumors showed no difference in macrophage content (Fig. 4d–f,

Fig. 3 Macrophage depletion during pre-malignant stages prevents early cancer cell dissemination. Twenty-week-old pre-malignant MMTV-HER2 mice
were treated with the anti-CSF1R ASF98 antibody and animals were harvested after 2 weeks with no signs of invasive carcinoma (a). Analysis of H&E
staining of mammary gland sections confirmed the absence of invasive lesions (b, c; bars: 100 μm). E-cadherin expression in whole mammary glands was
determined (d; mean±SEM; control 7, anti-CSF1R 6 animals; statistical analysis: Mann–Whitney test) and by immunofluorescent staining against E-
cadherin in mammary gland sections (e, f; bars: 10 μm). E-cadherin signal intensity was measured in individual regions of cell junctions in three animals per

 Supplementary Table 4) at the end of the experiment between
control-treated and anti-CSF1R-treated mice. This suggests that
there is no impact on overt tumor growth in late tumors when
macrophages were depleted during early stages of cancer pro-
gression. Additionally, flow analysis of lungs revealed that neither
alveolar macrophage nor CD11b+/Gr1+ monocyte content was
affected (Supplementary Fig. 3B–F, Supplementary Table 7) by
the same treatment, arguing against a non-specific depletion of
macrophages. However, CSF1R blockade during early stages
significantly (p = 0.028) decreased solitary DCC burden in lungs
(Fig. 4j, Supplementary Table 4). CSF1R blockade during early
stages also caused a statistically significant (p = 0.039) decrease in
the number of metachronous metastases per mouse (Fig. 4k–l,
Supplementary Table 4), which were defined as the number of
metastatic lesions bigger than three cells (Fig. 4k–l, Supplemen-
tary Table 4). Previous work9, which was confirmed here, showed
that DCC clusters >5 cells tend to be positive for proliferation
markers (P-Rb and P-Histone-H3), arguing that they are growing
micrometastasis. This inhibitory effect of DCC burden and
metastasis was detected even after macrophage depletion had
been stopped in average for 1 month and animals had carried
fast-growing tumors. We conclude that macrophages aid early
dissemination of HER2+ early cancer cells, allowing for the early
DCCs to reach target organs and form metastasis.
Profile of myeloid cells in HER2+ early lesions. We next per-
formed an unbiased profiling of macrophages and other immune
cells present in WT and early lesions using time-of-flight mass
cytometry (CyTOF) (Fig. 5a–c, Supplementary Table 5) and
conventional fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Supple-
mentary Fig. 4A–G). Our data in the MMTV-Her2 model parallel
the differences between WT mammary gland-associated and
tumor-associated
macrophages
described
previously
in
the
MMTV-PyMT model35. Our CyTOF analysis36 showed that
frequency and expression patterns of different myelomonocytic
cells was similar between WT glands and early lesions, but dif-
fered from overt tumors (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Table 5, Sup-
plementary Fig. 4A, B, and Supplementary Table 7). Monocytes
were identified based on their high Ly6C levels (Fig. 5b, Sup-
plementary Table 5) and their percentage relative to CD45+ cells
increased in early lesions compared to WT mammary tissue, but
this was not due to the increase in numbers (Fig. 5b, d, Supple-
mentary Table 5, and Supplementary Fig 4F). The remaining

Fig. 4 Early disseminated cancer cells contribute to metastasis formation. Macrophages were depleted from pre-malignant MMTV-HER2 mice by ASF98
treatment starting at week 18. Treatment was stopped when mice developed palpable tumors (1–3 mm average). a Mice were left until tumors reached 1
cm in diameter and then sacrificed. b Time from beginning of treatment at age wk18 until development of palpable tumors as mean±SEM (9 mice each,
23–38 wks old). c Time from formation of palpable tumors until tumors were overt (26-43 wks old) as mean±SEM (control N = 9, anti-CSF1R N = 6).
Macrophages in sections of overt tumors (at least three animals per group) were identified by staining against F4/80 at the end of the experiment (d, e;
bar: 100 μm; zoom factor in insets 5x) and quantified as the number of macrophages relative to tumor area (f; statistical analysis: Mann–Whitney test).
Vascularization of overt tumors was analyzed by staining against endomucin, an endothelial cell marker (g, h; bar: 100 μm; zoom factor in insets 4x) and
quantified as endomucin+ area/tumor in at least three animals combined (i; mean±SEM; statistical analysis: Mann–Whitney test). Solitary DCCs in lung
sections and metastases defined as cell clusters bigger than three cells were quantified in lung sections stained against HER2 (j–l, bar: 25 μm). For solitary
cell analysis, the average of DCCs or metastases per 100 fields was counted; each dot represents one lung section. For metastasis analysis, the total
number of metastases per lung sections was quantified and plotted (j). Number of mice N = 6 (control) and N = 4 (αCSF1R) animals combined; statistical

Fig. 5 Phenotypic profiling of immune cells in early mammary cancer lesions. a Whole mammary glands from FVB wild-type mice or 14-week-old and 22-
week-old pre-malignant MMTV-HER2 mice were analyzed by mass cytometry. viSNE plots were generated from myelomonocytic cells (gating strategy see
Supplementary Fig. 4A, B). Results from one representative animal is shown; number of animals per group N = 5; individual experiments N = 2. The three
sub-populations were identified as Ly6C+ monocytes and CD206hi and CD206lo macrophages based on their expression levels of Ly6C (b) and CD206
(c). These three populations were then analyzed for their frequency amongst all myelomonocytic cells. d–f Dot plots show mean±SEM of five animals per
group. Heat plots for three individual animals per group with expression levels of selected markers Ly6C (b), CD206 (c), Tie2 (i), and IdU incorporation as
a proliferation marker (j) were generated for CD206lo and CD206hi macrophages as identified in the viSNE plots. g, h viSNE plot and quantification of

 numbers (Supplementary Fig. 4E, Supplementary Table 7).
Iododeoxy-uridine (IdU) incorporation analysis revealed that
CD206lo macrophages were more proliferative starting at week 14
throughout to over tumor stages, while CD206hi macrophages
remain non-proliferative (Fig. 5j, Supplementary Table 5). In
early lesions CD206hi macrophages expressed slightly higher
levels of CD11b than CD206lo macrophages (Supplementary
Fig. 4C). Tie2 levels were significantly (p < 0.05) different between
CD206hi and CD206lo macrophages in either CyTOF or con-
ventional FACS measurements (Fig. 5i, Supplementary Table 5,
Supplementary Fig. 4G, Supplementary Table 7). We observed no
changes in other lymphoid or myeloid cells (Supplementary
Fig. 4F, Supplementary Table 7). Overt tumors, as expected,
showed changes in almost all populations (Supplementary Fig. 4F,
Supplementary Table 7). We next performed in situ staining to
define the phenotype and location of intra-epithelial macrophages
in early lesions, which cannot be resolved by FACS (Fig. 5k–m,
Supplementary Table 5). We found that stromal and intra-
epithelial macrophages in both WT glands and early lesions
displayed higher CD206 mean fluorescence intensity than that
detected in macrophages in overt tumors (Fig. 5n, Supplementary
Table 5). Our data suggest that circulation-derived monocytes do
not contribute to the CD206 macrophage pool at early lesions.
However, the IF analysis show that CD206hi macrophages are the
macrophage subset found within the stroma and intra-lesion
compartments in early lesions, but that intra-lesion macrophages
express the highest CD206 levels, suggesting a local translocation
(Fig. 5k–n, Supplementary Table 5).
Pre-malignant cells attract macrophages via CCL2. We next
focused on what signals might HER2 upregulation induce to
attract local macrophages from the stroma into the early lesions.
In invasive breast cancer models, HER2 signaling activates NF-
κB, which transcriptionally induces CCL2, a potent macrophage
chemotactic factor37. We found that the p65 subunit of NF-κB
subunit was phosphorylated in mammospheres derived from
HER2+ early cancer cells, and lapatinib, a HER2 and EGFR
inhibitor, inhibited its phosphorylation (Fig. 6a, Supplementary
Table 6 and Supplementary Fig. 7). We then isolated RNA from
mammospheres derived from either FVB WT or MMTV-HER2
early lesions as described9 and performed quantitative real-time
PCR (Q-RT-PCR) analysis for cytokine mRNAs. We found that
already at these early stages of progression, HER2+ cancer cells
upregulated expression of Ccl2 but not Csf2, Csf1, Il1β, and Il6
(Fig. 6b, Supplementary Table 6 Supplementary Fig. 5A, B,
Supplementary Table 7). Csf2 mRNA was detectable in WT and
early lesion-derived spheres but the expression was not different
between these groups and could not be confirmed by IF analysis
(Supplementary Fig. 5C, E), while overt tumors showed detectable
CSF2 arguing that early lesions do not express CSF2 (Supple-
mentary Fig. 5F, Supplementary Table 7). Upregulation of CCL2
around HER2+ early cancer cells was also observed at the protein
levels as confirmed by quantifying soluble CCL2 in the condi-
tioned media of the early cancer cells by enzyme-linked immu-
nosorbent assay (ELISA) and by IF analysis (Fig. 6c, d,
Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Fig. 5G–H, Supple-
mentary Table 7). Quantification of the increase in CCL2 IF
signal (Supplementary Fig. 5H, Supplementary Table 7) in the
HER2+ cells vs. WT epithelium in Fig. 6c (see also, Supplemen-
tary Table 6) revealed a difference that was confirmed by ELISA
and quantitative PCR (qPCR) from isolated mammospheres from
the same primary tissues. CCR2+/CCL2+ cells could be found
close to CCL2+ early cancer cells that showed lower signal for
both CCR2 and CCL2; these signals were undetectable in WT
tissues (Fig. 6c insert shows CCR2, Supplementary Table 6,
Supplementary Fig. 5I, Supplementary Table 7). Q-RT-PCR of
RNA isolated from FACS-sorted monocytes, macrophages, neu-
trophils, and HER2+ cancer cells during early stages of progres-
sion confirmed the CCL2 production by HER2+ early lesions
(Supplementary Fig. 5J, Supplementary Table 7), as detected by q-
RT-PCR, IF analysis, and ELISA (Fig. 6b–d, Supplementary
Table 6). HER2+ early lesions produce lower levels of CCL2
mRNA than monocytes and macrophages, suggesting multiple
sources of CCL2. Organoids produced by early MMTV-HER2
cancer cells displayed a reduction in secreted and peri-organoid
CCL2 production upon inhibition of HER2 or NF-κB signaling
with specific inhibitors38 as detected by IF analysis and ELISA
(Fig. 6e–g, Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Fig. 5G, K,
Supplementary Table 7). To confirm that CCL2 signaling was
necessary
and
sufficient
for
HER2-dependent
macrophage
attraction, HER2+ early cancer cells were grown as three-
dimensional (3D) acinar structures in vitro for 5 days. Cultures
were then treated with lapatinib, an IKKβ inhibitor,38 or an
inhibitor of the CCL2 receptor, CCR2 (RS504393), and macro-
phages isolated from mammary glands of MMTV-HER2 mice
were added to the cultures. After 24 h of co-culture, macrophages
were associated with ~50% of all organoid structures in control
samples (Fig. 6h, Supplementary Table 6). In contrast, co-cultures
treated with the inhibitors all showed significant (p < 0.04)
reduction in macrophage association (Fig. 6i, j, Supplementary
Table 6). When we tested whether CCL2 was responsible for
Wnt-1 production by macrophages, we found that Raw264.7 cells
treated with recombinant CCL2 at doses known to stimulate
chemotaxis39, produced more Wnt-1 than control-treated cells
(Supplementary Fig. 5L). We next treated 20-week-old MMTV-
HER2 mice carrying only early lesions (no palpable or overt
tumors) for 2 weeks with a CCR2 inhibitor (Fig. 6k, l, Supple-
mentary Table 6). We found that the number of intra-epithelial
macrophages was significantly (p = 0.004) reduced (~40%) when
mice were treated systemically (Fig. 6m, Supplementary Table 6).
However, systemic CCR2 inhibition did not reduce the number of
early circulating cancer cells (eCCCs) (Fig. 6n, Supplementary
Table 6) compared to the treatment that blocked the CSF1R,
which reduced intra-epithelial macrophages by ~77% (Fig. 3h,
Supplementary Table 6). It is possible that the CCR2 inhibitor is
less potent in blocking macrophage translocation than the anti-
CSF1R antibody as evidenced by the stronger inhibition in
macrophage translocation into the mammary tissues. When the
CCR2 inhibitor was administered locally into the fat pad to avoid
more widespread systemic effects (Fig. 6n, Supplementary
Table 6), intra-epithelial macrophage content was reduced com-
pared to contra-lateral control-treated glands (Fig. 6o, Supple-
mentary Table 6). We conclude that HER2 signaling in cancer
cells from early lesions activates NF-κB to induce CCL2, but that
other myeloid cells also produce significant CCL2 mRNA. We
further conclude that CCL2 may be a signal that stimulates
macrophages to produce Wnt-1 as shown in Fig. 2k–l.
Intra-epithelial macrophage in patient DCIS lesions. Published
data showed that more than 10% of patients with DCIS had
detectable DCCs in their bone marrow (BM), but no histologic
markers, which include invasive fronts and receptor status were
indicative of the presence of DCCs3. Macrophages are detected in
the stroma of normal breast tissue40. To test whether macro-
phages could also infiltrate early lesions in humans, we undertook
a pilot analysis of a small number of patient samples and com-
pared macrophages in healthy human breast tissue vs. tissue from
DCIS lesions as a model of early-stage breast cancer lesions.
Macrophages were identified as CD68+/CD45+ and CK8/18− cells
(Supplementary Fig. 6A, B). As reported40, in breast tissue from

 healthy donors (n = 7), CD68+/CD45+/CK8/18− macrophages
were localized in the stroma in the vicinity of mammary ducts but
remained outside the ducts, which were delimited by an intact
myoepithelial layer of cells (Fig. 7a). In contrast, even in DCIS
lesions that displayed an apparently intact myoepithelial layer,
there was a statistically significant (p = 0.0006) increase in the
frequency of macrophages found inside the aberrant ductal epi-
thelial structure in between cancer cells (n = 10) (Fig. 7b, c). The
intra-epithelial
CD68+/CD45+/CK8/18−/E-cadherin−
macro-
phages were commonly associated with cancer cells (CD68
−/CD45−) that showed reduced E-cadherin levels in human DCIS
samples (N = 12) as measured by quantitative image analysis
(Fig. 7d–f). Additionally, within the same patient, individual
lesions with high macrophage numbers had lower E-cadherin
levels (Supplementary Fig. 6C–E). Additional breakdown in grade
subgroups showed that healthy tissues and low-grade DCIS
showed no difference in the frequency of intra-lesion macro-
phages (Supplementary Fig. 6F). However, high-grade lesions
showed
a
significant
(p < 0.04)
increase
in
intra-lesion
macrophages when compared to healthy and low-grade tissue
(Supplementary Fig. 6F). Quantification of intra-lesion macro-
phages in HER2− or HER2+ DCIS lesions revealed no differences
(Supplementary Fig. 6G). This work is limited by the low number
of patients. However, the pilot data suggest that other oncogenic
signals associated with a high-grade histological subtype in
humans could also result in macrophage attraction into the
lesions. These may be signals as those propagated by the PyMT
oncogene as macrophages in TMEM structures were detected in
early MMTV-PyMT lesions (Supplementary Fig 1C–E and 2A).
Discussion
Our published work has shown that oncogene-driven early dis-
semination is due to the co-option by oncogenic pathways of
mechanisms of motility and invasion activated during mammary
branching morphogenesis8, 9. This included the activation of cell
intrinsic pathways that through an EMT-like program propelled
early
dissemination
and
metastasis8,

 dissemination was documented in humans in breast and pan-
creatic cancer6, 41. Our data suggest that macrophages enter the
epithelium of early lesions in mice where they create early dis-
semination microenvironments that in both the PyMT and HER2
models had all the components of TMEM21, 33. Based on our data
we hypothesize that HER2+ early cancer cells attract macrophages
locally and in response to the CCL2 signal these macrophages also
produce CCL2, as macrophages from WT mammary glands
expressed lower levels of CCL2. We further hypothesize that these
intra-epithelial macrophages (IEM) macrophages produce Wnt-1
in response to CCL2 to dismantle epithelial E-cadherin junctions.
That the CCR2 inhibitor did not result in a decrease in eCCCs
may be due to dosing limitations or to a stronger dependence of
eCCC precursors on CSF1 than CCL2. Nevertheless, our in vitro
2D and 3D organoid culture data allow us to propose that, while
early cancer cells produce several Wnt ligands8, 9, Wnt-1 may be
exclusively produced by macrophages. However, we acknowledge
that a limitation of our study is the absence of in vivo validation
of the Wnt-1 role in the context of early dissemination. The
dissemination-promoting function of macrophages was proven
when we found that depletion of macrophages in early HER2+
lesions using anti-CSF1R antibodies reversed the loss of E-
cadherin in HER2+ lesions as well as intravasation and dis-
semination to lungs. Interestingly, Wnt signaling is linked to
branching morphogenesis42, 43 and a subset of tumor-associated
macrophages that drive invasive cancer dissemination through
TMEM formation also secrete Wnt ligands31, while CCL2 pro-
duction by colorectal cancer cells can also foster vascularization
and intravasation as shown in more advanced tumors44. The
detection of TMEM in the PyMT and HER2 early lesions not only
support that these mechanisms are not HER2 exclusive but also
that these structures that orchestrate intravasation and have a
clinical prognostic value33 may be operational at earlier time
points than expected from the invasive cancer paradigm.
We found that the myelomonocytic landscape of HER2+ early
lesions at the time of early dissemination resembled that of
healthy mammary glands and paralleled the findings in the PyMT
model35. Early lesions contained both F4/80+/CD11b+/CD206hi/
Tie2hi and F4/80+/CD11b+/CD206lo/Tie2lo macrophages. In
contrast, overt tumors predominantly contained CD11bint/
CD206lo/Tie2hi macrophages as described35. In situ imaging
supported that F4/80/CD206hi macrophages may be more fre-
quently intra-epithelial but the total number and proportion in
the mammary tissue do not differ from the CD206lo population.
That CD206hi populations of macrophages were Tie2hi suggest
that they might function as a subset of macrophages in invasive
breast cancer lesions that are gatekeepers of intravasation door-
ways21. Our results raise the possibility that when HER2 or other
oncogenic signals are activated in mammary epithelial cells,
macrophages that translocate into the early lesions from the
stroma have the inherent potential to aberrantly fuel epithelial cell
motility as observed during mammary gland development19, 20,
45. However, further scrutiny and lineage tracing experiments
would be required to fully understand the origin of macrophages
driving early dissemination.
We found that when macrophages were depleted during early
stages, but allowed to rebound during invasive stages, lung
metastatic burden was reduced. This result indicates that early
DCCs contribute to lung metastasis formation, either directly or
indirectly. Surprisingly, large tumors that persisted in mice for
~1.5 months were not able to compensate for the reduced mac-
rophages and dissemination during early stages. This may be due
to the lower dissemination capacity we observed in HER2+ overt
tumors vs. early lesions8. Further, that the number of solitary
DCCs, likely a mixture of DCCs accumulated since the early
stages, was reduced by CSF1R blockade suggests that the reduced
influx of DCCs to lungs during early stages was not replaced by
DCCs arriving during the time of tumor detection to euthanasia
when tumors were large. This is in agreement with our recent
phylogenetic data that a fraction of metastasis detected late in
MMTV-HER2 animals were indeed derived from early DCCs and
not from the overt primary tumor8 (Fig. 8a, scenario 1).

 Additionally, early DCCs may cooperate with later arriving DCCs
to form metastasis in patients, which after DCIS treatment go on
to develop invasive lesions or in patients who had DCIS but only
were diagnosed later for invasive cancer (Fig. 8b, scenario 2). The
low number of patients in our pilot analysis and the fact that
there might be mouse to human differences in macrophage
function limits the conclusions of our study on the human rele-
vance of our findings. Nevertheless, it encourages further testing
of human samples to determine whether detection of macro-
phages and E-cadherin levels in DCIS lesions may help predict
which patients have early dissemination.
Early dissemination may also impact the concept of the “pre-
metastatic” niche46, 47 where this microenvironment could be
orchestrated by early DCCs in addition to BM-derived cells. Qian
et al.26 showed that in MMTV-PyMT-invasive cancer models,
VEGFR+/CCR2+/CXCR4−/Tie2− macrophages fuel metastasis in
the lung26. Our data show that macrophages rebound in tumors
during overt growth stages. Still, even after this rebound,
metastasis were reduced if the anti-CSF1R-mediated depletion of
macrophages was done during early stages. We propose that the
VEGFR+/CCR2+/CXCR4−/Tie2− macrophage-mediated support
of metastasis may not be able to compensate for the reduction in
DCCs caused by macrophages depletion during early dis-
semination in primary sites. However, we cannot rule out the
possibility that the anti-CSF1R monoclonal antibodies affected
the population described by Qian et al.26 in lungs. Thus, it is
possible that during early stages, depletion of VEGFR+/CCR2
+/CXCR4−/Tie2− macrophages also impacted early DCC lodging
in lungs. This is an interesting possibility we will explore in future
studies.
Overall, our studies suggest that oncogenes might turn on
developmental programs of anoikis resistance28, migration and
invasion8, 9, and macrophage translocation into the early lesions
much earlier than anticipated. These programs then initiate early
dissemination before propelling rapid tumor growth. Overall, in
this study, we provide critical new insights into the understanding
of the natural history of metastatic disease in mice and we
demonstrate that early in cancer evolution macrophages and early
DCCs appear to play a seminal role in metastatic breast cancer
that can manifest later in life of these mice.
Methods
Cells and cell culture. Raw264.7 cells were received from ATCC. Transfection
with mCherry was done using mCherry lentiviral vectors and maintained in
DMEM (Lonza) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% Pen/Strep. Comma-1D
cells were a generous gift from Daniel Medina and were maintained in Dulbecco's
modified Eagle's medium: Nutrient Mixture F12 (DMEM-F12) medium containing
2% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep. For DKK1 stimulation, conditioned media were pre-
pared from DKK1-expressing 293T cells which were a gift from S. Aaronson. For
preparation of conditioned medium (CM), protein concentration was determined
using a Bradford assay; cells were cultured with serum-free medium (DMEM + 1%
Pen/Strep) for 24 h and then concentrated using Vivaspin 20 Centrifugal Con-
centrating tubes (Sartorius, VS2021) at 3000×g up to 3 h until a desired con-
centration (10x) was reached. DKK1 protein (0.5 μg/ml) was used for stimulation.
For co-culture experiments, Comma-1D cells were seeded on coverslips, and after
12 h, Raw264.7-mCherry cells were added. Co-cultures were fixed in 2% formalin
after 12 h and then stained. All cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma.
Raw264.7-mCherry cells were treated with recombinant CCL2 (20 ng/ml, catalog
number: 250-10, Peprotech), and 24 h later, the levels of Wnt-1 were detected by
qPCR. Comma-1D cells were cultured with the CM from Raw264.7-mCherry cells
(24 h, diluted 1/40), and after 24 h, the percentage of cells forming E-cadherin
junctions were detected by IF analysis. Raw264.7-mCherry CM was incubated
overnight with anti-WNT1 ab (ab15251, Abcam) or IgG control, then depleted
from CM and finally added to Comma-1D cells.
Mouse experiments. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount
Sinai, protocols 08-0366 and 2014-0190. Mice used were female FVB/N-Tg
(MMTVneu)202Mul/J or FVB WT mice and were purchased from Jackson
Laboratory and bred in-house. Animals were killed using CO2 at age 14 weeks,
20–22 weeks or when invasive tumors had reached a diameter of 1 cm. For mac-
rophage depletion, we administered 3 mg of the CSF1R antibody clone ASF98 on
day 1 and 1 mg on day 7 and weekly thereafter by injection into the tail vein of 18-
week-old pre-malignant MMTV-Her2 mice. PBS was used as a vehicle control.
Treatment lasted 14 days or until tumors were first palpable (3 mm diameter).
ASF98 antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Miriam Merad. For CCR2 blockade,
mice were either treated with 2 mg/kg of RS504393 (Tocris Bioscience) or vehicle
control (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) daily by intraperitoneal injections for 14 days
or by injection of 1 mg/kg RS504393 into the fat pad for 5 days.
Mammary gland whole mounts. Mammary glands were excised, spread on glass
slides and fixed in overnight in 4% formalin at 4 °C. Glands were then dried for 5
min and fixed in Carnoy’s fixative (60% ethanol, 30% chloroform, 10% glacial
acetic acid) for 2–4 h at room temperature. Glands were washed in 70% ethanol for
15 min and in 50% ethanol twice for 15 min each and rinsed with distilled water for
5 min. Staining with carmine alum solution occurred overnight (0.2% carmine,
0.5% aluminum potassium sulfate in water boiled for 20 min and then filtered).
Glands were washed in 70% ethanol for 15 min, in 96% ethanol and in 100%
ethanol for 15 min and in xylene for 15 min and stored in methyl salicyate.
Microscopy. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples were prepared and
stained as described48. For IHC, VectaStain Elite ABC Rabbit IgG and Mouse IgG
Kits (PK-6102) from Vector Laboratories were used for secondary antibodies.
Secondary antibodies were left for 1 h at room temperature. DAB and Vector Blue
Substrate Kit (Vector Laboratories) were used for enzymatic substrate. Mounting
was done using VECTASHIELD Mounting Media (Vector Laboratories). For
CD206 stainings, cryosections were used. Tissue was fixed in 4% formalin over-
night, incubated in 30% sucrose/PBS overnight and sectioned into 6 μm sections.
Staining of cryosection was done as described49. Antibodies used were: CD68

Fig. 8 Models summarizing findings and potential scenarios for early DCC role in metastasis development. a Scheme of macrophage-regulated early
dissemination from pre-invasive lesions where CCR2+/CD206hi/F4/80hi/Tie2hi macrophages are attracted into early lesions by HER2-mediated and NF-
κB-mediated upregulation of CCL2. Our models support that intra-epithelial macrophages in turn secrete Wnt-1 in response to CCL2 production by cancer
cells and also other immune cells and thereby further cement an EMT-like response that is also stimulated by autocrine/paracrine production of other Wnt
ligands8, 9 to drive early dissemination. b Early DCCs contribute to metastasis formation, either as a slow cycling seeds of metastasis (scenario 1) or by
interacting with the microenvironment and/or later arriving DCCs to create a “pre-metastatic niche” that is eDCC-orchestrated and more permissive for
the growth of late or early and late cancer cells (scenario 2)

#sc-65495, clone 7C7, 1:100). For co-staining of F4/80 and CD206 (both raised in
rat), an A488-conjugated F4/80 antibody (BioLegend, #123119, clone BM8, 1:50)
was used in combination with CD206 (BioLegend, #141726, clone C068C2, 1:100)
in a sequential stain. Microscopic analysis was carried out with a Leica widefield
microscope or with a Leica confocal microscope for 3D cultures. For quantification
of IF signal intensity with the Metamorph software, regions of interest were defined
in original tiff files that had been taken under the same exposure time and settings
and the mean signal intensity was measured. Because the use of a directly con-
jugated F4/80 antibody resulted in lower signal intensity, we used Iba1 as a mac-
rophage marker21 to identify macrophages for CD206 signal intensity
measurement instead. For detection of micrometastasis and macrometastasis we
followed published protocols9. Briefly, the dormant non-proliferative lesions are
mostly single cells or clusters of up to 10 cells as defined by the absence of
proliferation markers such as Ki-67, P-Rb and P-ser10-histone H39, 48, 50, 51. In
some studies, we found an upper limit of 20 cell clusters completely devoid of
proliferation makers. For each study, the analysis of proliferative vs. non-
proliferative lesions is calibrated for a specific operator that is developing the study.
In this paper, we found that 5-cell clusters were a good indication of a lower limit
for what we call a proliferative micrometastasis. This number was within range of
our previous studies in the MMTV-Her2 model9.
Flow cytometry. MMTV-HER2 mice were killed using CO2 at age 18–22 weeks
(early pre-malignant cancer lesions) or when overt tumors had formed. Whole
mammary glands or tumors were digested in collagenase/bovine serum albumin
(BSA) at 37 °C for 30–45 min. Red blood cell lysis buffer (Sigma) was used to
remove blood cells. Cell suspensions were blocked with Fc-blocking reagent
(eBioscience) and samples were surface stained in FACS buffer (PBS supplemented
with 1% BSA and 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) for 20–30 min on ice
using the following antibodies: CD45-PerCPCy5.5 (BioLegend, #103131, clone 30-
F11, 1:200), CD11b-PeCy7 (eBioscience, #101215, clone M1/70, 1:200), CD11c-PE
(eBioscience, #117307, clone N418, 1:100), Gr1-AF700 (eBioscience, #56-5931-80,
clone RB68C5, 1:200), Tie2-biotin (eBioscience, #13-5987-82, clone TEK4, 1:100),
F4/80-biotin (BioLegend, #123105, clone BM8, 1:100), CD206-APC (BioLegend,
#141707, clone C068C2, 1:100), VCAM-FITC (eBioscience, #11-1061-82, clone
429, 1:50). DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) was used to label dead cells.
Multiparameter analysis was performed on a Fortessa (BD) and analyzed with the
FlowJo software (Tree Star). DAPI+ cells and doublets were excluded from all
analysis. To sort mammary tissue macrophages, whole mammary glands from 14-
week to 18–22-week (early pre-malignant cancer lesions) mammary glands or from
invasive tumors were digested in collagenase/BSA at 37 °C for 30–45 min. Mono-
nuclear cells were enriched in a Percoll gradient and then macrophages were sorted
as viable CD45+/Gr1−/CD11b+/F4/80+ cells.
To study the myeloid and lymphoid mammary gland infiltrate, FVB/N WT,
MMTV-HER2 18–22 weeks and MMTV-HER2 females with overt tumors were
digested as above and incubated with a panel for myeloid markers: Tie2-PE
(eBioscience, #12-5987-82, clone TEK4, 1:200), F4/80 APC (BioLegend, #123115,

1:200; CD19 eFluor450, eBioscience #48-0193-82, clone eBio1A3, 1:200). Counting
beads (40,000 beads/ml) were added per tube (500 μl per tube) and 2000 beads
were acquired of every sample (AccuCheck Counting Beads Life Technologies,
PCB100). Absolute numbers of CD45+ leukocytes were quantified as follows:
No:of cells
No:of cells acquired ´ No:of beads
1 ml
´ 0:5 ml
tube ¼ No:of cells=tube
Percentages obtained in flow cytometry among CD45+ cells (calculated as
mentioned before) were used to obtain absolute cell counts of every population.
Sorting of myeloid and CD45neg Her2+ populations. Mammary glands from
MMTV-Her2 females between 18 and 22 weeks old were digested as mentioned
above. Mammary tissue was incubated with a cocktail of antibodies including
CD11b-eFluor450 (eBiosciences, #48-0112-82, clone M1/70, 1:200), CD45-BV510
(BioLegend, #103137, clone 30-F11, 1:200), Ly6C FITC (BD Biosciences, #553104,
clone AL-21, 1:200), Ly6G-PE (BioLegend, #127607, clone 1A8, 1:200), CD11c
APC eFluor780 (eBiosciences, #47-0114-82, clone N418, 1:200), F4/80 PECy7
(BioLegend, #123113, clone BM8, 1:200), and Her2 (Abcam, #ab2428, 1:200)
antibody. Secondary anti-rabbit AlexaFluor647 (#A-21245, Invitrogen) was used
for Her2+ cell detection at a 1:200 concentration. Cells were incubated for 30 min at
4 °C in dark, and subsequently washed and incubated for 30 more minutes with
secondary antibody. PI (V35117, Life Technologies) was used as viability dye in
1:200 concentration. Monocytes were defined as CD45+CD11b+Ly6C+, neutrophils
as CD45+CD11b+Ly6G+, and macrophages as CD45+CD11c−F480+CD11b+. CD45
− fraction was subsequently analyzed for Her2 expression. CD45-Her2+ cells were
sorted. Sorted cells were directly lysed in Trizol LS (Ambion, 10296028) for RNA
extraction.
CyTOF analysis. All mass cytometry reagents were purchased from Fluidigm Inc.
(former DVS), unless otherwise noted. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1
mg IdU per mouse 16 h prior to the experiment. Lymph nodes were removed and
mammary glands were digested using the Miltenyi Fatty Tissue Digestion Kit. Cells
were then washed with PBS containing 1% BSA and blocked with Fc-blocking
reagent (eBioscience) to minimize non-specific antibody binding. Cells were
stained with a panel of metal-labeled antibodies against 20 cell surface markers
(Fig. 5, Supplement Fig. 1A) for 30 min on ice and then washed. All antibodies
were either purchased pre-conjugated to metal tags or conjugated in-house using
MaxPar X8 Conjugation Kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After
antibody staining, cells were incubated with cisplatin for 5 min at room tem-
perature as a viability dye for dead cell exclusion. Cells were then fixed and per-
meabilized with a commercial fix/perm buffer (BD Biosciences) and stored in PBS
containing 1.6% formaldehyde and a 1:4000 dilution of Ir nucleic acid intercalator
to label all nucleated cells. Immediately prior to acquisition, cells were washed in
PBS, and diH2O, and resuspended in diH2O containing a 1/10 dilution of EQ 4
Element Calibration beads. After routine instrument tuning and optimization, the
samples were acquired on a CyTOF2 Mass Cytometer in sequential 10 min
acquisitions at an acquisition rate of <500 events/s. The resulting FCS files were
concatenated and normalized using a bead-based normalization algorithm in the
CyTOF acquisition software and analyzed with Cytobank. FCS files were manually
pre-gated on Ir193 DNA+ CD45+ events, excluding dead cells, doublets, and DNA-
negative debris. Myeloid-derived cells were manually gated based on CD11c and
CD11b expression and the gated myeloid populations were then analyzed using
viSNE36 based on all myeloid phenotypic markers. Putative cell populations on the
resulting viSNE map were manually gated based on the expression of canonical
markers, while allowing for visualization of additional heterogeneity within and
outside the labeled population bubbles.
Mammospheres and 3D mammary primary epithelial cell cultures. Acini cul-
tures were performed as described52, 53. eCCs (5 × 104) were seeded in 400 μl Assay
Medium in 8-well chamber slides coated with 40 μl of Matrigel (Corning). Acini
formed at an efficiency of around 30 acini/1 × 104 mammary epithelial cells plated.
For macrophage co-cultures, primary tissue macrophages were added at a ratio of
500 per 1 × 104 eCCs seeded to 5-day-old acini cultures. For inhibitory treatments,
5-day-old acini cultures were treated for 24 h with 1 μM lapatinib (LC Labora-
tories), 2 μM IKK inhibitor38 (generous gift from Dr. Albert Baldwin), 1 μM CCR2
inhibitor RS504393 (Tocris Bioscience) or DMSO as vehicle control. Cultures were
then fixed for IF with 4% PFA. Mammosphere cultures were prepared as descri-
bed53. To prepare CM, 5-day-old mammosphere culture were plated in serum-free
DMEM medium and CM was harvested after 24 h. ELISA detection for CCL2 was
done following the protocol provided by the manufacturer (catalog number:
MJE00, R&D systems).
Immunoblotting and qPCR. Immunoblotting was performed as described pre-
viously54, 55. Antibodies used were P-NF-κB p65 (Cell Signaling, polyclonal) and β-
tubulin (Abcam, polyclonal). For expression analysis of FVB WT mammary epi-
thelial cells or MMTV-Her2 eCCs, epithelial cells were isolated and grown as
mammospheres for 5 days as described53. For expression analysis of Raw264.7
macrophages, cells were grown as monolayers in 6-well culture dishes and treated
with CM for 24 h. RNA isolation was performed using Trizol (Life Technologies)
or the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) for MTMs. RT-PCR and qPCR were performed as
described48. All samples were normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehy-
drogenase (GAPDH) expression and 2−ΔΔCt values were calculated as described56.
Primers were purchased from IDT. Primer sequences were as follows: mouse—
GAPDH forward primer, 5′-AACTTTGGCATTGTGGAAGGGCTC-3′; GAPDH
reverse primer, 5′-TGGAAGAGTGGGAGTTGCTGTTGA-3. E-cadherin forward
primer, 5′-CAAGGACAGCCTTCTTTTCG-3′; E-cadherin reverse primer, 5′-
TGGACTTCAGCGTCACTTTG-3′. Wnt-1 forward primer, 5′-CAGTG-
GAAGGTGCAGTTGCAG-3′; Wnt-1 reverse primer, 5′-CAGTGGAAGGTG-
CAGTTGCAGC-3′. CSF1 forward primer, 5′-CAACAGCTTTGCTAAGTGCTC

CCC and DCC detection. For CCC analysis, blood was drawn by cardiac puncture
following IACUC protocols. CCCs were purified using negative Lineage Cell
Depletion Kit (Miltenyi), fixed with 3% PFA for 20 min on ice and cytospin pre-
parations were carried out by centrifugation of blood cells at 500 r.p.m. for 3 min
using poly-L-lysine-coated slides (Sigma). CCCs were stained by IF against CK8/18
and HER2. CK8/18+ and HER2+ cells were counted and plotted per ml of blood.
For DCC analysis in lungs, lung sections were stained against HER2. Complete
lung sections were screened for HER2+ DCCs at x1000-fold magnification. From
each animal, the average number of DCC per section from three individual lung
sections was quantified.
Statistical analysis. Unless noted otherwise, all the experiments presented in the
manuscript were repeated at least three times with replicates of at least 3. Statistical
analysis was done using the GraphPad Prism software. For all cell culture
experiments (experiments with technical replicates), one-tailed Student t tests were
performed. For mouse experiments, Mann–Whitney tests were used. Differences
were considered significant if p values were ≤0.05.
