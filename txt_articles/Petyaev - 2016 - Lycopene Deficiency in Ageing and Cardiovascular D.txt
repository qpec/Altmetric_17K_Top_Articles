Lycopene is a hydrocarbon phytochemical belonging to the tetraterpene carotenoid family and is found in red fruit and vegetables.
Eleven conjugated double bonds predetermine the antioxidant properties of lycopene and its ability to scavenge lipid peroxyl
radicals, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide. Lycopene has a low bioavailability rate and appears in the blood circulation
incorporated into chylomicrons and other apo-B containing lipoproteins. The recent body of evidence suggests that plasma
concentration of lycopene is not only a function of intestinal absorption rate but also lycopene breakdown via enzymatic and
oxidative pathways in blood and tissues. Oxidative stress and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide may
represent a major cause of lycopene depletion in ageing, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. It has been shown
recently that low carotenoid levels, and especially decreased serum lycopene levels, are strongly predictive of all-cause mortality and
poor outcomes of cardiovascular disease. However, there is a poor statistical association between dietary and serum lycopene levels
which occurs due to limited bioavailability of lycopene from dietary sources. Hence, it is very unlikely that nutritional intervention
alone could be instrumental in the correction of lycopene and carotenoid deficiency. Therefore, new nutraceutical formulations of
carotenoids with enhanced bioavailability are urgently needed.
1. Introduction
Lycopene is a polyunsaturated hydrocarbon phytochemical
present in red fruit and vegetables (papayas, tomatoes, red
peppers, watermelons, etc.) and belongs to the tetrater-
pene carotenoid family [1]. Ingestion of products containing
cooked tomato accounts for about 80% of daily dietary intake
of lycopene in the developed world [2, 3]. Despite significant
individual disparities, the average consumption of lycopene
varies between 5 and 7 mg/day in the western world [4]. Due
to its distinctive ability to neutralize free radicals, lycopene
is believed to confer measurable protection against cancer,
atherosclerosis, diabetes, and some inflammatory diseases
[5, 6]. Indeed, a growing body of epidemiological evi-
dence suggests that lycopene consumption is associated with
decreased risk of various chronic diseases, while lycopene
also demonstrates significant antioxidant activity in a number
of in vitro and in vivo systems [7]. The multiple biological
effects of lycopene are predetermined by the unique chemical
structure of the compound and its particular physicochemi-
cal properties.
2. Physical and Chemical Properties
Lycopene is a 40-carbon atom acyclic fat-soluble compound
containing 13 linearly aligned double bonds, 11 of them
being conjugated. It occurs in nature as an all-trans-isoform,
often referred to as all-E-lycopene [8]. Thermal process-
ing as well as intestinal digestion of raw tomato products
facilitates cis-isomerization of lycopene [9]. In the human
body, lycopene is represented predominantly by various cis-
isomers (referred to as (Z)-lycopene) suggesting that cis-
transformation is essential for efficient intestinal absorption
[10]. cis-isomerization can also be initiated by exposure of
lycopene to heat, light, and oxygen although this can eventu-
ally cause irreversible degradation of the lycopene molecule
to a number of small end products [8]. C=O bonds are
chromogenic and confer a distinctive red color to lycopene
crystals. Double bonds are essential to the antioxidant prop-
erties of lycopene which are a major functional feature of the
compound. Amongst the different carotenoids, lycopene has
the highest 1O2 quenching ability, exceeding the antioxidant
properties of carotene by at least twofold [11]. (Z)-isomers

3. Bioavailability and Absorption
Bioavailability of lycopene and other carotenoids is poorly
understood and studied. It has been shown recently that
structural localization of lycopene in the chloroplasts of fruit
and vegetables is an important factor limiting bioavailability
of lycopene from dietary sources since chloroplasts have high
resistance to gastric and intestinal digestion [10]. Thus, food
matrix structure predetermines significantly the bioavailabil-
ity of lycopene. A significant portion of dietary lycopene
is excreted from the human body in undigested form and
there is no immediate absorption peak in plasma lycopene
level after a single tomato meal. However, there is a clear
cumulative lycopene absorption spike in the plasma of vol-
unteers after a 5-day ingestion period of lycopene-containing
products [12]. As shown in Figure 1, the ingested portion of
lycopene released from the food matrix becomes solubilized
and emulsified inside the intestinal lumen and is transported
with scavenger receptor class B type 1 protein (SR-B1) via
the epithelium of small intestine [13]. Lycopene distribution
among tissues is very selective. The testes, adrenals, liver, and
prostate have the highest lycopene concentration, while other
organs are known to have much lower lycopene content [14].
Plasma lipoproteins are major delivery vehicles of carotenoids
and lycopene in the human body [15].
Therefore, it is very likely that the differences in lycopene
tissue levels are related to variation in tissue expression of
lipoprotein receptors and cholesterol transporters.
4. Daily Requirements
There is no consensus on recommended daily dose of
lycopene since carotenoids are considered to be nonessential
micronutrients. In the industrialized European countries,
daily intake of lycopene varies from 0.7 mg (Finland) to
1.3 mg (Germany), while a much higher range (3.7‚Äì16.1 mg)
is reported for the United States [16]. Higher intake of
lycopene at daily dosage up to 100 mg has no side effects
in volunteers [17]. No evidence of toxicity of lycopene has
been obtained from in vivo studies using laboratory animals
[18]. Clinical studies use moderate amounts of lycopene rarely
exceeding 10 mg per day. However, in animal experiments
daily supplementation up to 200 mg/kg has been reported
[19]. Therefore, low toxicity and high tolerance of lycopene
open the door to various options in the design of lycopene
supplementation protocols.
5. Lycopene in Blood
Factors influencing blood levels of lycopene represented in
humans by cis-isoforms are not well understood as yet.
Among these is geographic location of individuals and health
status as well as a number of sociodemographic factors. It has
been reported [20] that median lycopene concentration in the
plasma of the general population of the USA is 0.59 ùúámol/L
(range 0.07‚Äì1.79), whereas average lycopene concentration
in the Scandinavian countries, in particular Finland, seems
to be lower ‚àí0.16 ¬± 0.11 ùúámol/L. A very recent study [21]
defines world regions with low and high levels of lycopene
consumption. Surprisingly, Northern and Western Europe
along with Central Africa and the Middle East represent the
geographical areas with the lowest lycopene consumption as
opposed to the Asian countries which display the highest
level of lycopene consumption in the world attributed to
high intake of fruit and vegetables [21]. It is also known
that age and plasma lipid levels (LDL, total cholesterol, and
triglycerides) are inversely correlated to blood lycopene level
[20, 22]. Lower lycopene values are reportedly associated with
being unmarried, of lower income, and an older nonwhite
male [20].

6. Lycopene Depletion
Recent developments in molecular medicine reveal that the
plasma level of lycopene and other carotenoids is a function of
intestinal absorption rate as well as lycopene utilization in the
reactions of biological oxidation in tissues. The antioxidant
properties of lycopene and its ability to scavenge lipid peroxyl
radicals are attributed to the eleven conjugated double bonds
between its carbon atoms. When double bonds are oxidized
and broken by reactive oxygen and reactive oxygen species,
the lycopene molecule undergoes irreversible nonenzymatic
degradation leading to the formation of various oxida-
tive metabolites such as 2-apo-5,8-lycopenal-furanoxide,
lycopene-5,6,5Û∏Ä†,6Û∏Ä†-diepoxide, lycopene-5,8-furanoxide, and
lycopene-5,8-epoxide isomers [23, 24]. On the other hand,
lycopene level in blood and tissues can be significantly
affected by enzymatic degradation leading to the formation
of different end products. In particular, enzymatic cleavage of
lycopene by lipoxygenase is accompanied by accumulation of
3-keto-apo-13-lycopenone and 15,15Û∏Ä†-apo-lycopenal among
other minor cleavage products [24]. Depletion of lycopene
as well as formation of lycopene oxidative metabolites can
be reproduced in cell-free plasma specimens and isolated
lipoproteins by introducing into the medium enzymatic
systems generating reactive nitrogen species [25].
Taken together, these results suggest that oxidative stress
as well as hyperactivity of the endogenous enzymes responsi-
ble for generation of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide
may deplete lycopene reserves in human cells and tissues.
7. Lycopene Deficiency in Ageing
Plasma lycopene level can become significantly reduced dur-
ing the process of ageing. Older individuals show statistically
lower lycopene concentration values in blood as compared to
younger matching individuals with similar ethnic and dietary
background [26]. Intestinal absorption of carotenoids is a
complex multistage process which requires a fully intact and
functioning gastrointestinal epithelium and subset of various
enzymes [27]. Acute and chronic gastritis and abnormal
gastric acid secretion as well as deviations in intestinal
enzyme spectrum during ageing are considered to be major
causes of reduced intestinal carotenoid absorption in older
individuals [28]. Moreover, depleted levels of lycopene and
other carotenoids in older individuals are believed to reflect
age-related changes in the intestinal microbiota, which reg-
ulates bioavailability of carotenoids and polyphenols in the
large intestine [29]. Although additional research to explain
the causes and mechanisms of lycopene deficiency in ageing
is required, it is clear now that correction of carotenoid
deficiency in older individuals may have an enormous impact
on their health status. Recent DNA microarray analysis
reveals that lycopene supplementation prevents transcrip-
tional activation of genes implemented in the process of
ageing in multiple strains of mice [30]. This antagonizing
action was as effective as the effect of well-known SIRT-
1 activators such as starvation and resveratrol. Moreover,
lycopene has recently been shown to suppress activation of
the mTOR/AMPK cascade, a major metabolic pathway linked
to ageing [31]. These cutting-edge observations help us to
understand the multiple clinical and experimental reports
revealing the effects of lycopene on a variety of health con-
ditions associated with ageing. There are numerous pieces of
clinical evidence suggesting that lycopene supplementation
prevents osteoporosis and incidence of bone fractures [32,
33], improves pulmonary function [34], delays skin ageing
[35], and enhances physical performance in elderly patients
[36]. The set of clinical consequences of lycopene deficiency
is greatly enlightened by the solid body of clinical evidence
revealing the crucial role of lycopene in maintaining prostate
health and its ability to prevent prostate cancer in elderly
males [37, 38].
8. Lycopene and Cardiovascular Disease
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of
mortality and disability around the world. There is a massive
body of epidemiological results suggesting that Mediter-
ranean countries have a lower rate of CVD mortality when
compared to other regions of Western Europe and the United
States [39]. The reduced rate of CVD mortality can be
explained, at least in part, by the dietary culture of the
Mediterranean region which includes consumption of large
amounts of fruit and vegetables. Tomato-based products rep-
resent an essential element of the Mediterranean diet, which
motivates many researchers to search for the link between
lycopene consumption and occurrence of CVD. Epidemio-
logical studies provide indisputable evidence supporting the
direct role of lycopene in prevention of CVD. As has been
recently confirmed in the Framingham Heart Offspring Study
[40], there is a strong inverse association between lycopene
intake and incidence of myocardial infarction, angina pec-
toris, and coronary insufficiency. Low plasma lycopene levels
were reported by many researchers in hypertension, myocar-
dial infarction, stroke, and atherosclerosis [41, 42]. Less con-
vincing results and a more complex landscape emerge when
the data from interventional studies on lycopene use in CVD
patients are analyzed. There are multiple conflicting reports
on how lycopene administration affects the progression of
CVD and its outcomes [43, 44]. However, there is a certain
degree of reproducibility in scientific reports describing the
reduction of cholesterol (LDL and total), upregulation of
HDL [45], decrease in carotid artery intima-media thickness
[46], and lowering of both plasma markers of oxidative
damage [44] and postprandial oxidative stress [47] in patients
treated with lycopene. Nevertheless, the effect of lycopene
on progression of CVD remains a controversial topic in
modern medical science and requires further well-designed
clinical studies. The experimental approach brings much
more certainty regarding the beneficial role of lycopene in
CVD. There are multiple and reproducible reports describing
normalization of endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity
and nitric oxide level in coronary arteries [48], inhibition
of the mevalonate pathway of cholesterol biosynthesis [49],
improvement of endothelial function, and attenuation of
inflammatory damage [50] as well as improvements in
lipoprotein profile and their turnover [48] in different animal
models of CVD. These changes may represent a molecular
 4
Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity
basis for lycopene action in CVD. Significant discrepancies in
the outcomes of clinical and experimental studies verifying
the effect of lycopene on CVD can be explained, in our
opinion, by significant fluctuations in preexisting levels of
lycopene in the blood of subjects enrolled on clinical trials,
whereas lycopene concentration in the blood of experimental
animals kept on standardized diets tends to stay in a similar
range. However, individual variations in plasma lycopene
level in general populations may have a significant impact
on public health. As recently shown [51], low serum lycopene
and total carotenoid levels predict all-cause mortality as well
as poor outcomes and rapid progression of CVD in the adult
population of the USA. The majority of individuals, even in
developed countries, have astonishingly decreased levels of
lycopene and total carotenoids in the blood which translates
into higher stroke risk [52]. Decreased alpha-carotene and
lycopene concentrations in the blood have recently been
proposed as possible criteria for prognosis of public health
since they are inversely associated with CVD mortality in
a highly significant manner [53]. Although carotenoids are
considered nonessential micronutrients, there have been
some recent attempts to declare desirable plasma concen-
tration levels of carotenoids for public health. As recently
proposed, there are 5 cut-off levels for plasma carotenoid
levels [54]. According to the results of meta-analysis, a plasma
carotenoid level <1 ùúáM translates into a very high risk of
health consequences. Moderate health risk is proclaimed to
be associated with carotenoid concentration in the range 1.5‚Äì
2.5 ùúáM. Values for carotenoid concentration from 2.5‚Äì4 ùúáM
suggest a moderate risk, whereas carotenoid concentrations
over 4 ùúáM are proposed to have the lowest risk of health
consequences. According to the same report, over 95% of the
US population falls into the moderate or high risk category of
the carotenoid health index.
9. Conclusion
Recent advances in medical and analytical chemistry have
allowed pinpointing of multiple nonalimentary diseases and
pathological conditions associated with micronutrient defi-
ciencies. It has been increasingly recognized that health
conditions associated with oxidative stress (ageing, CVD, and
type 2 diabetes mellitus) are accompanied by significant devi-
ations in plasma and tissue levels of many important nutri-
ents, in particular lycopene and other carotenoids [55, 56].
Lycopene is the most powerful antioxidant from the
tetraterpene carotenoid family, its anti-radical properties
being mediated by eleven conjugated double bonds between
carbon atoms. Lycopene is essential in scavenging lipid per-
oxyl radicals, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide. Recent
advances in molecular science reveal that the interaction of
lycopene with reactive oxygen species leads to irreversible
nonenzymatic degradation of lycopene and formation of
various oxidative lycopene metabolites. There is also a newly
identified enzymatic pathway of lycopene degradation that
results in the formation of several end products excreted
from the human body. Thus, health conditions accompa-
nied by long-lasting oxidative stress may cause lycopene
depletion and require constant and efficient replenishment of
carotenoids in the antioxidant ‚Äúbasket‚Äù of human cells and tis-
sues. However, lycopene from dietary sources has extremely
low absorption and bioavailability rate. It appears in the blood
circulation incorporated into chylomicrons and other apo-B
containing lipoproteins and requires a sophisticated system
of intestinal absorption and distribution among the tissues.
Therefore, plasma concentration of lycopene needs to be
considered as an integral value reflecting both the intestinal
absorption rate of carotenoids and the intensity of lycopene
breakdown via enzymatic and oxidative pathways in blood
and tissues.
There is alarming prevalence of lycopene and carotenoid
deficiency in older individuals and CVD patients as well as
widespread carotenoid deficiency in the general population,
as revealed by latest research. This illustrates the necessity
for a well-designed nutritional strategy and new nutraceu-
tical products capable of normalizing plasma lycopene and
carotenoid levels in an efficient manner. However, it is very
unlikely that nutritional intervention alone will be sufficient
in the correction of carotenoid deficiency. There is a poor
statistical association between dietary and serum lycopene
levels which can be explained by the limited bioavailabil-
ity of lycopene from dietary sources. As shown recently,
plasma concentration of lycopene, but not dietary intake of
lycopene, correlates with predisposition to stroke [53]. It is
suggested that even a high intake of lycopene-containing food
products may not affect the health outcomes of lycopene
and carotenoid deficiency in the general population. There-
fore, new nutraceutical formulations of carotenoids and
lycopene with enhanced bioavailability are urgently needed.
In recent years, new formulations of lycopene and other
carotenoids with increased bioavailability have been created
using microemulsifying protocols and/or nanodelivery sys-
tems [57, 58]. Their implementation could be a milestone
development in the prevention and treatment of the health
consequences of lycopene and carotenoid deficiency in the
general population.
