Abstract
The United States is engaged in ongoing dialogue around mental illness. To assess trends in this 
national discourse, we studied the volume and content of a random sample of 400 news stories 
about mental illness from the period 1995–2014. Compared to news stories in the first decade of 
the study period, those in the second decade were more likely to mention mass shootings by 
people with mental illnesses. The most frequently mentioned topic across the study period was 
violence (55 percent overall) divided into categories of interpersonal violence or self-directed 
(suicide) violence, followed by stories about any type of treatment for mental illness (47 percent). 
Fewer news stories, only 14 percent, described successful treatment for or recovery from mental 
illness. The news media’s continued emphasis on interpersonal violence is highly disproportionate 
to actual rates of violence among those with mental illnesses. Research suggests that this focus 
may exacerbate social stigma and decrease support for public policies that benefit people with 
mental illnesses.
The United States is engaged in an ongoing dialogue around mental illness. Over the course 
of a lifetime, nearly half of all Americans will meet the criteria for a mental health disorder.1 
Mental illness is now the leading cause of disability in the United States,2 but only about 40 
percent of those affected receive treatment.3 Poor treatment rates are a function of multiple 
factors, including the historically separate financing and delivery of mental health services in 
the United States, provider shortages, and stigma.4–6 The past two decades have witnessed 
growing national awareness and discussion of these issues,7 as well as debate of policy 
options to close the mental health treatment gap.4,8 At the same time, considerable national

 dialogue has been devoted to the role of mental illness in interpersonal violence, a topic 
prompted in recent years by a series of high-profile mass shootings in which the perpetrator 
had a documented or purported serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia.9,10 Rising 
rates of suicide, particularly among members and veterans of the US military; the 
overrepresentation of people with mental illness in the criminal justice system; and the 
development of new therapies have also been a recent focus of the national discourse over 
mental illness.11–13
An established method for assessing the national dialogue around societal issues such as 
mental illness is analysis of news media coverage, which is viewed as both reflecting and 
shaping public discourse.14,15 News coverage reflects public discourse by reporting on the 
views and positions of the policy makers, advocacy groups, researchers, members of the 
public, and others engaged in issue debates, often directly quoting the key players.15 News 
coverage shapes public discourse and attitudes about societal issues in two main ways: 
agenda setting and issue framing.14,16 By focusing news coverage on certain topics, the 
news media influence which issues audiences deem important and in need of public policy 
response (agenda setting).14 By highlighting certain aspects of issues, the news media can 
influence public opinion about and preferred solutions to societal problems (known as “issue 
framing”).14
Descriptive studies of US news media content from the 1980s and 1990s showed that news 
stories about mental illness emphasized interpersonal violence.17,18 Most recently, Otto 
Wahl and colleagues examined news stories about mental illness that were published in six 
high-circulation US newspapers in a single year, 1999, and found that dangerousness was 
the most common theme in coverage, with more than a quarter of news stories involving 
accounts of violent criminal activity by people with mental illnesses.17 Wahl and his 
colleagues’ findings are consistent with studies of news coverage of mental illness in other 
nations, including Canada,19 the United Kingdom,20 New Zealand,21 and Spain.22 Emphasis 
on interpersonal violence in news coverage of mental illness is concerning given that most 
people with mental illnesses are never violent and only about 4 percent of interpersonal 
violence in the United States is attributable to mental illness.23 News coverage linking 
interpersonal violence to mental illness has been shown to exacerbate already high levels of 
social stigma toward those with mental illnesses.24 This emphasis on violence instead of 
other mental illness–related topics might contribute to a societal focus on enacting public 
safety–oriented policies, such as mandatory treatment and firearm restrictions, at the 
expense of public health–oriented policies designed to foster recovery.9,25,26
No prior US studies have either examined the content of recent news coverage of mental 
illness or assessed trends in coverage over time. To fill these gaps, in our study we analyzed 
the volume and content of news coverage of mental illness over the past two decades, from 
1995 to 2014. In addition to examining the topics and policies discussed in news stories 
about mental illness over this period, we assessed three types of news media messages 
shown in prior research to influence public attitudes about societal issues and support for 
policy: mentions of specific causes of mental illness (for example, neurobiological, trauma, 
and family-related causes), mentions of the consequences of mental illness (for example, 
criminal justice system involvement, stigma, and premature mortality), and individual

 depictions of people with mental illnesses (for example, a person with mental illness 
involved in the criminal justice system, undergoing successful treatment, or experiencing 
homelessness). Research shows that news media mentions of the causes and consequences 
of societal problems can influence audiences’ perceptions of the importance of an issue, 
attributions of responsibility for solving the problem, and endorsement of certain types of 
policy options that target the causes and address the consequences emphasized in the 
messages.27–30 Public attitudes about groups of people affected by societal problems—in 
this case, mental illness—are influenced by news media depictions of specific individuals 
who exemplify the problem in question, even if the individual depicted is not representative 
of the larger group.31
 Study Data And Methods
 APPROACH AND STUDY SAMPLE
We conducted a quantitative content analysis of a random sample of 400 US news stories 
about mental illness published or aired by high-circulation and high-viewership print and 
television news sources during 1995–2014.We used the LexisNexis and ProQuest online 
news archives to identify news stories focused on mental illness. News sources included 
three of the highest-circulation national newspapers in the United States during the study 
period (USA Today, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post); one of the highest-
circulation newspapers in each of the four US census regions (New York Times, Chicago 
Tribune, Atlanta Journal Constitution, and Los Angeles Times); evening news programs on 
three national television networks (ABC, NBC, and CBS); and all CNN news programs. All 
of the individual news sources selected were the highest-circulation or -viewership news 
source available for the twenty-year study period in the LexisNexis or ProQuest online 
archives.
 NEWS COVERAGE SELECTION
We searched the headlines of print news stories and television transcripts (LexisNexis and 
ProQuest include headlines for television transcripts, which, like newspaper headlines, 
summarize the topic of the news story) for news stories between 1995 and 2014 using the 
following search terms: “mental illness” or “mental health” or “mental” or “psych” or 
“depression” or “schizo” or “bipolar” or “anxiety” or “ptsd” or “adhd” or “attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder” or “attention deficit disorder” or “post-traumatic stress disorder” or 
“suicide.” The search returned 22,730 news stories. We selected a simple random sample of 
stories, excluding those not focused on mental illness (news stories were included if the 
majority of the story described any topic related to clinical mental illnesses; news stories 
about more general mental well-being topics, such as stress relief, were excluded), until we 
achieved an analytic sample of 400 randomly selected news stories. News stories and 
editorials with 100 or fewer words were excluded, as were letters to the editor, book reviews, 
and obituaries. The final study sample included 362 print news stories, 13 print opinion 
pieces, and 25 television news stories.
More than half of news stories mentioned some type of violence related to 
mental illness.

  MEASURES
To assess the content of news stories about mental illness, we developed a sixty-nine-item 
structured coding instrument (see Supplemental Exhibit 1 in the online Appendix)32 that 
captured items in five domains: specific topics in news coverage about mental illness, causes 
of mental illness, consequences of mental illness, individual depictions of people with 
mental illnesses, and public policies related to mental illness. We measured mentions of 
fifteen specific topics in news coverage including interpersonal violence, suicide, and 
treatment. Six specific causes of mental illness were measured, including stressful life events 
and genetics or biology. Likewise, six specific consequences of mental illness were coded, 
including criminal justice involvement and premature mortality. Nine different types of 
individual depictions were captured, including people with mental illnesses committing 
interpersonal violence or experiencing discrimination. Finally, we coded eleven specific 
public policies related to mental illness, including policies to expand inpatient treatment and 
community-based services.
All measures were dichotomous items. Two of this article’s authors (Alene Kennedy-
Hendricks and Seema Choksy) pilot-tested the instrument on a small subset of twenty 
articles and refined it based on pilot results. Once the instrument was finalized, a random 
sample of 25 percent (n = 100) of news stories was double-coded by the same two authors to 
assess interrater reliability for each dichotomous yes-no item in the coding instrument. All 
items met conventional standards for adequate reliability, with kappa values of 0.69 or 
higher (see the Appendix).32 Data were collected and analyzed from August to December 
2015.
 DATA ANALYSIS
We calculated the proportion of news stories mentioning each measure. To assess whether 
news coverage of mental illness changed over time, we used chi-square tests to compare the 
proportion of news stories mentioning a given measure in the first decade of the study period 
(1995–2004) versus the second decade (2005–14). We ran logistic regression models, 
controlling for news story word count and adjusting standard errors for lack of independence 
within news sources, to examine correlations between news media mentions of specific 
mental illness topics, causes, and consequences and mentions of mental illness treatment 
policies. We calculated predicted probabilities to illustrate the results of these models. We 
also conducted sensitivity analyses using chi-square tests to examine differences across five-
year periods (1995–99 versus 2000–04 versus 2005–09 versus 2010–14).
 LIMITATIONS
Our results should be interpreted in the context of several limitations. Our sample did not 
include the local television, blogs, and other online sources through which many Americans 
now access at least some of their news. Unfortunately, given that our study period spans 
twenty years, systematically analyzing such news sources was not feasible. Our exclusion of 
local television news sources is also an important limitation since a majority of Americans 
note local news as their primary news source,33 and it is not clear whether local news would 
follow the same coverage patterns that we observed in the national and regional news 
sources in our sample.

 Second, assessing how news media coverage of mental illness was associated with public 
attitudes during our study period was outside the scope of this study.
Third, because of our sampling approach, the majority of the study sample (94 percent) 
consisted of print news stories, which means that we were unable to test for systematic 
differences in coverage by news medium.
Finally, our analysis did not permit us to explain trends in news coverage of mental illness, 
which might be driven by competing issues in the news cycle or the shifting landscape of 
news coverage over time.
 Study Results
The volume of news coverage about mental illness trended downward over time (Exhibit 1). 
The two most frequently mentioned specific topics in news coverage about mental illness 
were violence—including both interpersonal violence and suicide—and mental health 
treatment issues.
Across the two decades of news coverage examined, there were no differences in the issues 
mentioned in news stories about mental illness (Exhibit 2). Overall, 55 percent of news 
stories mentioned violence related to mental illness, either interpersonal violence (38 
percent) or suicide (29 percent), and nearly half mentioned treatment (47 percent). Of the 
latter, issues surrounding access to, funding for, and quality of treatment for mental illness 
were most frequently mentioned (26 percent, 19 percent, and 16 percent, respectively). 
Fourteen percent of news stories mentioned successful treatment for or recovery from mental 
illness.
News coverage of mental illness and interpersonal violence focused on gun violence and 
mass shootings. In the subset of news stories about mental illness that mentioned 
interpersonal violence (n = 152), nearly three-quarters depicted a specific violent event 
committed by a person with or purported to have a mental illness (Exhibit 3). The most 
frequent type of events depicted were gun violence events generally and, more specifically, 
family violence events, mass shootings, and school shootings. News media descriptions of 
mass shootings by individuals with mental illnesses increased over the course of the study 
period, from 9 percent of all news stories in 1994–2004 to 22 percent in 2005–14 (p < 0.05). 
The proportion of newspaper stories about interpersonal violence related to mental illness 
that appeared on the front page increased from 1 percent in the first decade of the study 
period to 18 percent in the second decade (p < 0.001).
There were very few differences in news media mentions of the causes, consequences, and 
individual depictions of mental illness in the first versus second decade of the study period 
(Exhibit 4). The most frequently mentioned causes of mental illness over the entire study 
period were stressful life events (17 percent) and genetics or biology (14 percent). The most 
frequently mentioned consequences of mental illness overall were criminal justice 
involvement (29 percent) and stigma or discrimination (25 percent). The most frequently 
occurring individual depiction was of a person with mental illness committing interpersonal

 violence (28 percent). Only 7 percent of news stories over the entire study period included a 
depiction of successful treatment or recovery by a person with mental illness.
Over the twenty-year period, about a quarter of all news stories about mental illness 
mentioned a specific public policy issue (24 percent) (Exhibit 5). Policies related to the 
treatment of mental illness were the most frequently mentioned category of policy (14 
percent of news stories).
News media mentions of treatment for mental illness, interpersonal violence, and criminal 
justice system involvement were positively correlated with mentions of mental health 
treatment policies (see Supplemental Exhibits 2–6 in the Appendix).32 Stories that 
mentioned mental health treatment topics had higher predicted probabilities of also 
mentioning any treatment-related public policies, compared to other news stories (27 percent 
versus 2 percent). These included policies to expand community-based outpatient services 
(19 percent versus 5 percent) and policies to expand inpatient services (7 percent versus 1 
percent). News stories mentioning interpersonal violence related to mental illness had higher 
predicted probabilities of mentioning any treatment-related policies (22 percent versus 8 
percent), policies to expand inpatient treatment (7 percent versus 1 percent), and mandatory 
treatment policies (9 percent versus 3 percent) than stories that did not mention interpersonal 
violence. Stories that mentioned criminal justice involvement as a consequence of mental 
illness had higher predicted probabilities of also mentioning any treatment-related policy (23 
percent versus 10 percent), compared to other news stories. These included policies to 
expand community-based outpatient services (14 percent versus 8 percent), policies to 
expand inpatient mental health services (8 percent versus 1 percent), and mandatory 
treatment policies (6 percent versus 2 percent). News stories mentioning military or war 
involvement were more likely than other news stories to also mention policies to improve 
mental health screening and treatment of US military and veteran populations (62 percent 
versus 1 percent).
Coverage has continued to emphasize interpersonal violence in a way that is 
highly disproportionate to actual rates of such violence.
Sensitivity analyses showed no differences in trends in the content of news coverage about 
mental illness over time when time was measured in five-year periods versus decades 
(results not shown; available from the authors on request).
 Discussion
The volume of US print and television news coverage of mental illness trended downward 
from 1995 through 2014, aligning with the secular trend in the downsizing of newspapers. 
This downsizing trend had a disproportionate effect on the volume of science reporting, 
which might have contributed to the decreasing volume of news coverage of mental illness 
observed in this study.34 The content of news stories about mental illness changed very little 
during those twenty years. Overall, the most frequently mentioned topics pertained to 
interpersonal violence, suicide, and treatment of mental illness. Policies to improve or 
expand treatment were also the most frequently mentioned category of mental health 
policies, although such policies were mentioned in only 14 percent of stories. Criminal

 justice involvement was the most frequently mentioned consequence of mental illness, and 
when the news media portrayed a specific individual with mental illness, that individual was 
most frequently depicted as having committed an act of interpersonal violence.
More than half of news stories mentioned some type of violence related to mental illness. 
News stories were more likely to mention interpersonal violence than suicide, despite the 
fact that research indicates that suicide is much more directly related to mental illness than 
interpersonal violence.23 While the proportion of news stories mentioning interpersonal 
violence did not change over the two ten-year periods studied, these news stories were more 
likely to appear on the front page of newspapers in the second decade of the study period, 
which suggests that the prominence of this issue relative to other topics reported by the news 
media has increased. Our finding that the share of news stories mentioning mass shootings 
increased substantially in the most recent decade was consistent with another recently 
published study showing that the majority of US news coverage of mental illness and gun 
violence from 1997 to 2012 focused on mass shootings.10 These findings raise troubling 
implications for social stigma toward people with mental illnesses in the United States. 
Multiple studies have demonstrated a positive association between news coverage of 
violence by people with mental illnesses and stigma,24,35,36 and the news media’s emphasis 
on interpersonal violence over the two decades we studied mirrors unchanging levels of 
stigma toward people with mental illnesses in the United States.7,37 A 2013 experimental 
study found that exposure to a news story describing a mass shooting by an individual with a 
history of mental illness significantly exacerbated already high levels of social stigma 
toward people with mental illnesses.24
In contrast, a recent study found that depictions of people with mental illnesses receiving 
successful treatment and living productive lives in the community decreased levels of social 
stigma.38 However, we found that only 14 percent of news stories included any mention of 
the possibility of successful treatment or recovery, and only 7 percent included the type of 
individual depiction of a person in successful treatment shown to be effective at reducing 
stigma.38 Social stigma toward people with mental illnesses, which was mentioned as a 
consequence of mental illness in a quarter of all news stories, is important for several 
reasons. Social stigma and related discriminatory behavior is associated with low rates of 
mental health treatment seeking and adherence,39 and with a host of negative outcomes such 
as homelessness, unemployment, and criminal justice involvement.40 Furthermore, high 
social stigma is associated with lower levels of public support for policies that benefit people 
with mental illnesses, such as insurance parity and expanded government funding for 
treatment.41
Interestingly, news stories about interpersonal violence more frequently mentioned mental 
health treatment policies than other news stories did. While effective treatment can prevent 
the small subset of interpersonal violence resulting directly from mental illness—for 
example, violent actions prompted by psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or 
delusions—most interpersonal violence in US society is not caused by mental illness and 
therefore not preventable by treatment.9,23 Nonetheless, in recent years many advocacy 
groups and policy makers have argued for improving the mental health treatment system as a 
strategy for addressing high rates of gun violence generally, and mass shootings specifically,

 in the United States.9,26,42 Research suggests that this policy approach, advanced partly in 
an attempt to shift public attention and political momentum away from strengthening US 
gun laws, will not meaningfully address gun violence in America and might reinforce the 
link between mental illness and violence in the public psyche.23,42,43
Our study period coincided with US military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, which 
likely influenced news media content in several domains. News stories that mentioned 
military or war involvement as a cause of mental illness were more likely than other news 
stories to also mention policies to improve mental health screening and treatment for 
members and veterans of the US military. Despite the fact that suicide disproportionately 
affects these groups, news stories about suicide were no more or less likely than other stories 
to mention policies in this category.
 Conclusion
News media coverage of mental illness changed very little during 1995–2014. Coverage has 
continued to emphasize interpersonal violence in a way that is highly disproportionate to 
actual rates of such violence among the US population with mental illness. Initiatives to 
educate reporters and the opinion leaders they use as sources regarding the relationship 
between mental illness and interpersonal violence are needed, as are efforts to increase news 
media depictions of successful treatment for and recovery from mental illness, which have 
the potential to reduce harmful social stigma toward this population.
