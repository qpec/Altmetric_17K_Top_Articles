IMPORTANCE In cancer models, warfarin inhibits AXL receptor tyrosine kinase–dependent
tumorigenesis and enhances antitumor immune responses at doses not reaching
anticoagulation levels. This study investigates the association between warfarin use and
cancer incidence in a large, unselected population-based cohort.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association between warfarin use and cancer incidence.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based cohort study with subgroup
analysis used the Norwegian National Registry coupled with the Norwegian Prescription
Database and the Cancer Registry of Norway. The cohort comprised all persons
(N = 1 256 725) born between January 1, 1924, and December 31, 1954, who were residing
in Norway from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2012. The cohort was divided into
2 groups—warfarin users and nonusers; persons taking warfarin for atrial fibrillation or atrial
flutter were the subgroup. Data were collected from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2012.
Data analysis was conducted from October 15, 2016, to January 31, 2017.
EXPOSURES Warfarin use was defined as taking at least 6 months of a prescription and at
least 2 years from first prescription to any cancer diagnosis. If warfarin treatment started
after January 1, 2006, each person contributed person-time in the nonuser group until the
warfarin user criteria were fulfilled.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cancer diagnosis of any type during the 7-year observation
period (January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2012).
RESULTS Of the 1 256 725 persons in the cohort, 607 350 (48.3%) were male, 649 375
(51.7%) were female, 132 687 (10.6%) had cancer, 92 942 (7.4%) were classified as warfarin
users, and 1 163 783 (92.6%) were classified as nonusers. Warfarin users were older, with
a mean (SD) age of 70.2 (8.2) years, and were predominantly men (57 370 [61.7%]) as
compared with nonusers, who had a mean (SD) age of 63.9 (8.6) years and were mostly
women (613 803 [52.7%]). Among warfarin users and compared with nonusers, there was
a significantly lower age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) in all cancer sites
(IRR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.82-0.86) and in prevalent organ-specific sites (lung, 0.80 [95% CI,
0.75-0.86]; prostate, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.65-0.72]; and breast, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.82-1.00]).
There was no observed significant effect in colon cancer (IRR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.93-1.06).
In a subgroup analysis of patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, the IRR was lower
in all cancer sites (IRR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.59-0.65) and in prevalent sites (lung, 0.39 [95% CI,
0.33-0.46]; prostate, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.55-0.66]; breast, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.59-0.87]; and colon,
0.71 [95% CI, 0.63-0.81]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Warfarin use may have broad anticancer potential in a large,
population-based cohort of persons older than 50 years. This finding could have important
implications for the selection of medications for patients needing anticoagulation.

arfarinsodiumisthemostusedanticoagulantworld-
wide and is prescribed to 5% to 10% of the adult
population in Western countries1 for a range of in-
dications, including atrial fibrillation, prosthetic heart valves,
and venous thromboembolism.2,3 The antitumor potential of
warfarin is demonstrated in different experimental cancer
model systems.4-7 Previous epidemiological studies differ re-
garding the association between warfarin and cancer, with one
suggesting a specific association with urogenital cancers8 and
another indicating no association with cancer incidence.9 A
clearly defined molecular mechanism of how vitamin K an-
tagonism affects cancer development and a population-
based cohort study are needed to resolve this controversy.
Vitamin K in humans serves as a cofactor for gamma-
glutamyl carboxylase that converts glutamate to γ-carboxy-
glutamate in substrate N-terminal domains of vitamin K–de-
pendentproteins.ThisconversionallowsvitaminK–dependent
proteins to bind calcium and membrane phosphatidylserine
moieties with high affinity.10 The reduced (hydroquinone) ac-
tive cofactor form of vitamin K is maintained through the ac-
tion of 2 vitamin K oxidoreductases (VKORC1 and VKORC1L1),
whicharebothpotentlyinhibitedbywarfarin.11Treatmentwith
warfarin depletes vitamin K pools, leading to reduced gamma-
glutamyl carboxylase activity and noncarboxylated γ-carboxy-
glutamate domains of vitamin K–dependent proteins.12 These
proteins are comparatively rare in the human genome (num-
bering ≤14), comprising mainly proteins involved in blood clot-
ting and bone homeostasis.13 A notable exception is GAS6
(growth arrest–specific 6), the ligand of the AXL receptor ty-
rosine kinase family associated with immune regulation and
cancer.14 Warfarin treatment inhibits AXL receptor signaling,
blocking malignant traits of aggressive carcinoma cells and en-
hancing antitumor natural killer cell activity at doses that do
not affect coagulation.4,6 Importantly, noncarboxylated GAS6
retains full AXL binding affinity but is unable to induce recep-
tor activation, thus converting the ligand into a selective AXL
antagonist.10
New oral anticoagulants that target different factors in the
coagulation cascade and prevent the need for repeated blood
monitoring are gaining favor. Hence, it is important to more
clearly determine the cancer-protective potential of warfarin
to better inform the decisions on appropriate anticoagulation
regimens.
We conducted a population-based study to examine the
association between warfarin use and cancer incidence in a
large cohort of the Norwegian population.
Methods
Data Sources and Study Design
We conducted a nationwide cohort study using the Norwe-
gian National Registry, a national database that contains in-
formation on every person who is currently or has in the past
been a resident of Norway. Norway has comprehensive, popu-
lation-basednationalhealthregistrieswithbroadcoveragethat
aresupportedbyauniversalhealthcaresystem.Auniqueiden-
tification number assigned to each citizen and permanent resi-
dent enables the retrieval of coupled information for differ-
ent health conditions with a high level of accuracy and
completeness. The 11-digit personal identification number in-
cludes an individual’
s date of birth and sex,15 and the use of
this number yields linked information from different regis-
tries.Usingsuchasystem,wecoupledapopulationcohortwith
information from the Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN) and
the Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD). Data from the
Norwegian National Registry included year of birth, date of
death, sex, and emigration status. This study was approved
with a patient consent exemption by the Regional Ethics Com-
mittee;thisexemptionwasgrantedbecausethedatausedwere
already registered and anonymized. Data were collected from
January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2012. Data analysis was con-
ducted from October 15, 2016, to January 31, 2017.
Established in 1951, the CRN is a nationwide registry of all
cancer occurrences in Norway. Mandatory reporting from sev-
eral independent sources ensures the completeness and high
quality of CRN data.16 The CRN uses the International Classi-
fication of Diseases, Seventh Edition (ICD-7) and the Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition, Clinical Modi-
fication (ICD-10-CM) for diagnosis classification and the
International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edi-
tion for morphological classification of the different lesions.16
Data from the CRN included cancer diagnosis, date of diagno-
sis, and localization.
Established in 2004, the NorPD collects information on all
drugs dispensed by Norwegian pharmacies but not the drugs
used by hospitalized or otherwise institutionalized patients.
The NorPD uses the Anatomical Therapeutic Classification
System for categorizing registered drugs. The information
retrieved from the NorPD included the name of prescription;
dateofdrugdispensing;numberofdosesdispensed;andICD-7,
ICD-10-CM, and International Classification of Primary Care
(ICPC), Second Edition codes for indication of medication
use. Both the NorPD and the CRN have a 99% nationwide
coverage,16,17 which means 99% of all cancer diagnoses and
99% of all prescriptions in the country are registered in these
registries.
The study cohort (N = 1 256 725) included all persons born
between January 1, 1924, and December 31, 1954, who were
living in Norway from January 1, 2006, through December 31,
2012. Using identification numbers, we coupled this cohort (1)
with the CRN to retrieve information on all cancers in the co-
hort diagnosed between January 1, 2006, and December 31,
2012, and (2) with the NorPD to retrieve information on war-
farin prescriptions in the cohort filled from January 1, 2004,
Key Points
Question Is warfarin use a protective factor for cancer?
Findings In this population-based cohort study of 1 256 725
persons, there was a significantly lower age- and sex-adjusted
incidence rate ratio of cancer among warfarin users vs nonusers.
Meaning Warfarin, used by millions of adults worldwide, may be
associated with lower cancer incidence across a broad range of
malignant neoplasms.

and the data were analyzed anonymously.
Warfarin Exposure Assessment
In Norway, warfarin is only available by prescription. To de-
fine regular prediagnostic users, we divided the study cohort
into 2 groups—warfarin users and nonusers. According to the
hypothesized molecular mechanism, a minimal warfarin ex-
posure period along with a minimal interval between expo-
sure and cancer diagnosis was assumed to be required for war-
farin to affect cancer development. The warfarin users group
comprisedpersonswhoreceivedawarfarinprescriptionatleast
2 years before any cancer diagnosis and with an interval be-
tween first and last prescription of at least 6 months. For war-
farin users without a cancer diagnosis, the interval between
first and last prescription had to be at least 6 months. All other
person-years in the cohort were classified as nonusers. The du-
ration of warfarin use was calculated according to the time in-
terval between the first and last prescription of warfarin, with
the assumption that the use was continuous between these
two dates.
Indication for warfarin use was drawn from the NorPD
based on the refund code registered on the prescriptions. For
prescriptions dated before March 3, 2008, the coding system
did not specify the indication for the warfarin use but used
larger groups of diagnosis. After March 3, 2008, patients on
warfarin for atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (AF) were iden-
tified by 2 different systems: the ICD-10-CM (code I48) for pre-
scriptionsmadebyhospitalphysiciansandtheICPC(codeK78)
for prescriptions made by general practitioners. First warfa-
rinprescriptionsafterMarch3,2008,wereusedfortheAFsub-
group analysis; warfarin user criteria were otherwise identi-
cal. Warfarin users contributed person-time in the nonusers
group until the warfarin user criteria were fulfilled.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive analyses are given as frequencies and propor-
tions and means with SDs. The study cohort was followed from
inclusion to the date of cancer diagnosis, date of death, or end
offollow-up(December31,2012),whicheveroccurredfirst.The
primary cancer diagnosis for each person was used for the cal-
culations. We calculated the person-years of observation for
each group to account for differences in follow-up time be-
tween the groups. To examine the cancer risk for warfarin us-
ers compared with nonusers, we calculated the incidence rate
ratios(IRRs),adjustingforsexandage(2-yearagegroups),using
the Mantel-Haenszel test. A 95% CI was applied to determine
statisticalsignificance.IfwarfarintreatmentstartedafterJanu-
ary 1, 2006, each person contributed person-time to the non-
users group until the person fulfilled the criteria of a warfarin
user to avoid immortal-time bias. Site-specific results are pre-
sented if the number of cancer incidences in the user group
wasatleast10cases.Competingriskregression(methodofFine
and Gray18) was conducted with death as a competing event.
Toaddresstheincreasedriskofcanceraftervenousthrom-
boembolism and pulmonary embolism, we conducted a sen-
sitivity analysis among the AF subgroup, who were patients
prescribed warfarin to prevent thromboembolic events after
AF. The IRRs were analyzed for all cancer sites and site-
specific cancers of the AF subgroup and compared with those
of the nonusers group.
A separate sensitivity analysis addressed the influence of
differenttimeintervalsbetweenwarfarinprescriptionandcan-
cer diagnosis in the user definition. All the statistical calcula-
tions were performed using Stata/IC, version 13.1 and Stata/
IC, version 14 (StataCorp LLC).
Results
Characteristics of the Cohort
The study cohort comprised all persons aged 52 to 82 years liv-
ing in Norway from January 1, 2006, through December 31,
2012. Of the 1 256 725 persons included in this cohort, 92 942
(7.4%) were classified as warfarin users. During the study fol-
low-up period (January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2012), 132 687
persons (10.6%) were diagnosed with cancer over 8 008 218
person-years. The mean (SD) follow-up time was 6.15 (1.8)
years, and the median (interquartile range) duration of war-
farin use was 4.7 (2.2-7.8) years. Most warfarin users (71 688
[77.1%])weretreatedformorethan2years.Warfarinuserswere
older, with a mean (SD) age of 70.2 (8.2) years, and were pre-
dominantly men (57 370 [61.7%]) compared with nonusers,
who had a mean (SD) age of 63.9 (8.6) years and were mostly
women (613 803 [52.7%]). The baseline characteristics of the
cohort are listed in Table 1.
Warfarin Use and Cancer Incidence
In the warfarin users group, 8754 persons (9.4%) received a
diagnosis of cancer in 430 266 person-years. In the nonusers
group, 123 933 persons (10.6%) received a diagnosis of cancer
in7 577 952person-years.Asexpected,themostprevalentcan-
cer sites were prostate, lung, colon, and breast, representing
a total of 65 747 persons (49.6%). We observed a significantly
lower IRR for all cancer sites in the warfarin users group com-
pared with the nonusers group (adjusted IRR, 0.84; 95% CI,
0.82-0.86) (Table 2; eTable 1 in the Supplement). A signifi-
cantly lower IRR in 3 of the 4 most prevalent cancer sites was
found in the warfarin users group compared with that in the
nonusers group: prostate (IRR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.65-0.72), lung
(IRR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.75-0.86), and female breast cancer (IRR,
0.90; 95% CI, 0.82-1.00). For lung cancer, subtype analysis
revealed a lower IRR for non–small-cell lung carcinoma
(IRR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.74-0.87) and small-cell lung carcinoma
(IRR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.59-0.86) in the warfarin users group com-
pared with the nonusers group (Table 2).
Sensitivityanalysesonallcancersites’riskstratifiedbyage,
sex, and duration of warfarin use are shown in eTable 2 in the
Supplement. We detected in the warfarin users group a lower
IRR with the shortest and longest warfarin exposures as well
as a lower IRR for men than women. No difference in cancer
riskwasdetectedwhentheminimaltimeintervalbetweenwar-
farin treatment and cancer diagnosis was less than 2 years.
Competing risk analysis with death as a competing event con-
firmed the results despite more deaths occurring in the war-
farin users group.

 Subgroup analysis of the AF subgroup, which comprised
33 313 persons (35.8%) in 135 617 person-years of warfarin use,
showed a significantly lower IRR for all cancer sites (IRR, 0.62;
95% CI, 0.59-0.65) and most prevalent sites (compared with
nonusers): IRR for prostate was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.55-0.66), lung
was 0.39 (95% CI, 0.33-0.46), and female breast was 0.72 (95%

justed IRRs between all warfarin users and warfarin users with
AF for all cancer sites combined and the 4 most prevalent can-
cer sites are shown in the Figure.
Discussion
Our large population-based study with a subgroup analysis of
patients with arrhythmia reveals a remarkable association be-
tween warfarin use and lower cancer incidence across a broad
range of malignant neoplasms. The well-known challenges of
warfarindosingthatnecessitateregularmonitoringhavefueled
a transition to new oral anticoagulants.19 An unintended con-
sequence of this switch to new oral anticoagulants may be an
increased incidence of cancer, which is an important consid-
eration for public health.
Thromboembolic disease is associated with an elevated
cancer risk, especially the first year after the diagnosis, and
this is an important potential confounder.20,21 Patients with
AF routinely receive warfarin treatment to prevent embolic
strokes.22 Hence, this subgroup lacks the occult preexisting
malignant neoplasm characteristic associated with patients
with thromboembolic events. A large number of patients
with AF were identified in the cohort, and the association
between warfarin use and lower cancer incidence in this sub-
group was stronger compared with that in groups in the main
analysis. This finding supports the hypothesis that warfarin
may exert considerable cancer protection against major carci-
noma types.
By inhibiting GAS6-AXL signaling, warfarin blocks tumori-
genesis (independent of anticoagulation) in murine
models.4,6,23 Importantly, AXL signaling suppresses antitu-
mor immunity.6,24 Hence, the observed association between
warfarin use and lower cancer incidence is likely due in part
to an enhanced antitumor immune surveillance of early can-

 cer. Congruently, warfarin is associated with immune activa-
tion, and autoimmune disorders are reported as an adverse
effect.6,25,26
Results from this study show that warfarin therapy is as-
sociatedwithalowerincidenceformanybutnotallcancersites.
Clinical practice in Norway ensures that suspected cancer is bi-
opsied and biopsied also for persons receiving warfarin treat-
ment.Nevertheless,theincidenceofsuperficialcancer(eg,skin)
isjustascommoninwarfarinusersasinnonusers,whereassev-
eral screening-detected cancers (eg, prostate, breast) have a
lower incidence. On the other hand, we observed no differ-
ence in colorectal cancer, which is suspected to be more appar-
ent when a patient receives anticoagulation therapy (such as in
colorectalneoplasiawithhematochezia).Interestingly,theseob-
servations correspond with reported AXL expression, which is
prevalent in lung and breast cancers, for example, but lower in
nonmelanoma skin cancers and lymphomas.27
To our knowledge, this observational cohort study is the
first to use large, nationwide cancer and prescription regis-
tries to examine the association between warfarin therapy and
cancerincidence.ThecoupledNorwegianhealthregistriespro-
vided a reliable basis for our investigation and enabled the for-
mation of a population-level cohort with numerous diverse
cancer cases and long-term follow-up. Selection bias is un-
likely as the cohort was extracted from a national registry that
includes all residents within the selected age group. Cancer
cases were identified using the CRN with 99% coverage.16 The
risk of recall bias for warfarin use is eliminated by the NorPD,
which has had nearly complete coverage since 2004.17
Prescription data may overestimate drug exposure as not
all prescriptions were filled. Our warfarin user definition mini-
mizes this bias. Short-term or unfilled prescriptions were ex-
cluded to avoid compliance issues. Furthermore, patients’in-
ternational normalized ratio levels were closely monitored by
health professionals to adjust warfarin dosage and optimize
anticoagulation. This monitoring contributes to the detec-
tion of symptoms of undiagnosed cancer. Focusing on cancer
incidence 2 years after treatment highlights the influence of
warfarin on early neoplasia. Most patients (71 688 [77.1%]) con-
tinued warfarin therapy for more than 2 years, with a mean

 (SD) duration of 4.8 (2.8) years. Patients with transient risk fac-
tors generally did not receive warfarin treatment beyond 3 to
6 months, although this decision remains at the discretion of
the treating physician. This discontinuation may in part ac-
count for the lower IRR in the small fraction of patients who
received warfarin therapy for 6 to 24 months. Differences in
cancer risk between patients who received short-term and
those who received long-term warfarin treatment could influ-
encetheobservedIRRdifferencesintreatmentduration.Over-
all, most patients treated with warfarin have poorer health and
higher cancer risk compared with a healthy population. Many
of the risk factors for cancer are the same risk factors for AF
and thromboembolic disease, such as alcohol use, obesity, and
smoking.20,28
Another source of potential bias is that warfarin treat-
ment criteria may exclude patients with complicating comor-
bidities or other tolerance issues. No alternative anticoagula-
tiontreatmentswereavailableforcomparisonduringthestudy
period. Patients with severe comorbidities may be less likely
to participate in established cancer screening programs (eg,
mammography, Papanicolaou test).
Limitations
Thisstudyhasseverallimitations.First,animportantbutquan-
titatively modest limitation is that the NorPD lacks informa-
tiononmedicationsdispensedinhospitalsandnursinghomes,
and this missing data could have led to the systematic mis-
classification of some individuals as nonusers. In addition, we
did not have access to prescription data before 2004. Thus, in-
dividuals may have used warfarin longer than the time regis-
tered, or warfarin therapy may have been discontinued prior
to 2004 and users were misclassified as nonusers. These mis-
classifications are expected to decrease the observed warfarin-
associated cancer protection. Interruptions in treatment be-
tween first and last prescription among warfarin users may not
be detected, leading to the misclassification of person-years
without treatment in the warfarin users group and poten-
tiallyincreasingtheobservedassociationbetweenwarfarinuse
and lower cancer incidence.
Second, information was missing on comedications
used by patients that may affect cancer development, such as
statins, β-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors.8,29,30However,acase-controlstudyidentifiedapro-
tective association of warfarin with prostate cancer (IRR, 0.67-
0.80) depending on the length of treatment and after control-
ling for potential confounders by other drugs.8
Third, there was a potential bias due to the lack of infor-
mationoncancerdiagnosespriortothestudystart.Thus,some
registered cancer occurrences might have been recurrences.
Fourth, information on lifestyle choices (eg, diet, weight
management,orsmoking)wasunavailableintheregistriesand
could not be addressed. Alcoholism and liver disease are con-
traindications for warfarin treatment and risk factors for can-
cer development. We observed a significantly lowered IRR for
alcohol-relatedcancers,suchasheadandneckcancerandliver
cancer.2 Some of this observed association could be explained
by a lack of these risk factors in the warfarin users group.
Conclusions
Conflicting conclusions on the association between warfarin
anticoagulation therapy and cancer risk have been reported
(eg, Tagalakis et al31). A prospective randomized clinical trial
comparing 6 months with 6 weeks of warfarin therapy follow-
ing venous thromboembolism reported a significant reduc-
tion in incidence among those in the 6-month group after
8 years of follow-up.32 However, a separate study found no sig-
nificant reduction in cancer after extending warfarin treat-
ment to 1 year in patients with initial occurrence of venous
thromboembolism.33 A case-control study found no signifi-
cantdifferenceinbladdercancerrisk34;similarly,arecentstudy
did not observe a decreased risk of prostate cancer among war-
farin users.9 Notably, these studies included any warfarin ex-
posure, including short-term treatment and treatment prior to
cancer diagnosis, leading to a higher number of warfarin us-
ers (13% to 16%) than observed in our study cohort and than
expected in a general population (eg, 3% to 9%).1 In contrast,
we applied a stricter definition of warfarin use, with a 2-year
minimum time interval between start of warfarin treatment
and cancer diagnosis, to test the hypothesis that warfarin may
affect earlier-stage neoplasia. Cancer development is a pro-
tracted process spanning many years. Hence, enforcing a strict
definition of warfarin use, with a minimum time interval
between start of warfarin treatment and cancer diagnosis, is
necessary for warfarin treatment to plausibly influence can-
cer incidence.
Our results document a lower incidence of cancer associ-
ated with warfarin in a population-level study. We observed
a lower relative risk in a large cohort comprising many differ-
ent cancer types, reinforced by a subgroup analysis of
patients with AF who were receiving warfarin treatment to
prevent thromboembolic events. Our data indicate that war-
farin provides a possible cancer protection, a finding that
may have important implications for choosing medications
for patients who need anticoagulation. Further studies are
warranted to fully elucidate the mechanisms underpinning
these observations.
