Owing to their specificity and high-affinity binding, monoclonal antibodies have potential as
positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands and are currently used to image various
targets in peripheral organs. However, in the central nervous system, antibody uptake is
limited by the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Here we present a PET ligand to be used for
diagnosis and evaluation of treatment effects in Alzheimer’s disease. The amyloid b (Ab)
antibody mAb158 is radiolabelled and conjugated to a transferrin receptor antibody to enable
receptor-mediated transcytosis across the BBB. PET imaging of two different mouse models
with Ab pathology clearly visualize Ab in the brain. The PET signal increases with age and
correlates closely with brain Ab levels. Thus, we demonstrate that antibody-based PET
ligands can be successfully used for brain imaging.

 P
ositron emission tomography (PET) imaging of amyloid b
(Ab) deposits in the brain has rapidly advanced in
recent years. The introduction of the radioligand [11C]PIB
(ref. 1), a derivate of thioflavin-T, was an important development
for diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), as [11C]PIB amyloid
imaging detects AD pathology early in the course of disease2 and
helps distinguishing AD from other types of dementia3,4.
[11C]PIB, and analogues of PIB, detect amyloid plaques, mainly
consisting of insoluble fibrils of Ab (ref. 1). However, the load of
insoluble Ab does not correlate well with disease progression5,6.
Soluble Ab is a better marker of disease status7–10, and
many therapeutic as well as diagnostic efforts are currently
targeting soluble Ab aggregates, for example, oligomers and
protofibrils11–17, which are strongly implicated as the cause of
synaptic failure and neurodegeneration in AD9,10,18–23. This new
focus highlights the pressing need for an imaging agent that can
visualize soluble Ab aggregates. The development of small
molecular PET radioligands often suffers from nonspecific
binding
of
the
radioligand,
and
further,
low
ability
to
discriminate between different forms of a protein. Radioligands
based on antibodies have recently been introduced in clinical use
for various peripheral antigens primarily related to cancer24.
Antibodies have the advantage that they can be developed to bind
a specific form of a protein, but their use as PET radioligands for
targets in the central nervous system (CNS) is hampered by
their
low
brain
penetration.
However,
whereas
a
high
enough brain uptake is essential to achieve a PET signal, the
specific-to-nonspecific binding, expected to be very high for a
monoclonal antibody compared with small molecules, may be
equally important.
Our previously developed conformation-selective monoclonal
antibody mAb158 displays a distinctive selectivity for soluble Ab
protofibrils
as
compared
with
monomeric
Ab.
It
binds
preferentially to soluble protofibrils over mature, insoluble fibrils,
but without affinity for the Ab protein precursor (AbPP)25–28.
These characteristics make the antibody suitable to selectively
target soluble Ab aggregates in vivo, and its humanized version,
BAN2401, (hereafter referred to as h158), is currently studied in a
phase 2b clinical trial as an anti-Ab therapy against AD.
In a previous study we showed that 72 h after administration,
the brain concentrations of iodine-125-labelled mAb158 ([125I]
mAb158) was significantly increased in a transgenic AD mouse
model
(tg-ArcSwe,
harbouring
the
Arctic
(E693G)
and
Swedish (KM670/671NL) AbPP mutations29) compared with
non-transgenic littermates (wild type; WT)27. However, total
levels of [125I]mAb158 in the brain were rather moderate, which
is anticipated for antibodies in general30.
Different strategies have been applied to increase the brain
uptake of antibodies and other large molecules. Among them is
receptor-mediated transcytosis, where the antibody is fused to a
molecule
that
specifically
binds
to
a
blood–brain
barrier
(BBB) expressed receptor, for example, the transferrin or insulin
receptor, which enables active transport across the BBB (Fig. 1a).
This technique was pioneered by Pardridge and colleagues31 in
the 1990s, and has recently been implemented in AD therapy to
decrease production32,33 or increase degradation34 of Ab.
In the present study, a F(ab0)2 fragment of h158 is chemically
fused to a transferrin receptor (TfR) antibody35 with the aim to
create a PET ligand for specific imaging of soluble Ab protofibrils.
Brain retention of the generated bispecific fusion protein
increases 15-fold, compared with F(ab0)2-h158. We then show
by PET imaging that the brain distribution of 124I-labelled fusion
protein correlates closely with the age-dependent increase of
Ab pathology in the brains of two transgenic mouse models
with AD-like pathology. This new radioligand has the potential
to become an important diagnostic tool in AD and furthermore,
the study demonstrates that bispecific radioligands based on
antibodies can be applied in medical imaging of proteins
associated with CNS disorders.
Results
Engineering of an Ab–TfR bispecific fusion protein. A PET
ligand with a fairly short systemic half-life is desired since a rapid
elimination from the blood increases the specific signal compared
with the background, derived from the blood volume of the
studied tissue (about 5% in brain) and decreases the radiation
dose for the patient. Therefore, a F(ab0)2 fragment was generated
by enzymatic cleavage of h158, reducing its systemic half-life to
B2 h in both tg-ArcSwe and WT mice, compared with 11 days
for mAb158 (ref. 27). The Ab-binding properties of F(ab0)2-h158
were unchanged, compared with the parent antibody. To increase
brain uptake of F(ab0)2-h158, it was chemically conjugated to the
anti-TfR antibody 8D3 (ref. 36), which has been widely used to
increase the brain uptake of large molecules34,37–40.
The 8D3-F(ab0)2-h158 fusion protein was sufficiently pure for
the intended purpose (Fig. 1b). The difference in fusion protein
binding in solution to Ab monomer, protofibril and fibril,
reflected by their ability to inhibit the fusion protein’s binding to
an Ab-coated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

 plate, was very similar to what we have previously reported for
mAb158 (refs 25,27), with median inhibitory concentration
values of 240 nM for monomers, 1.0 nM for protofibrils and
12 nM for fibrils (Fig. 1c). Furthermore, it retained its binding to
both
TfR
and
Ab
protofibrils
also
after
radioiodination
(Fig. 1d,e).
Increased brain uptake by TfR-mediated transcytosis. The
pharmacokinetic blood profile of the radioiodinated fusion
protein [125I]8D3-F(ab0)2-h158 was the same in tg-ArcSwe and
WT mice displaying a half-life of 11 h (Fig. 2a). For successful
PET imaging, it is important to have a high brain uptake of the
ligand in relation to its concentration in blood. Therefore, the
brain-to-blood ratio (Kp) of the fusion protein was assessed by
ex vivo studies at three different time points. Radioactivity was
measured in blood and saline-perfused brains of 412-month-old
tg-ArcSwe
and
WT
mice,
killed
4,
24
and
72 h
after
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of [125I]8D3-F(ab0)2-h158. At 4 h
Kp was low (0.02±0.01), with no difference between tg-ArcSwe
and WT mice. Kp had increased at 24 h and was significantly
different (Po0.05) between the groups. At 72 h post injection, Kp
had further increased to 0.44±0.10 (Po0.001) in tg-ArcSwe,
while the WT mice were stable on a low level (Fig. 2b). The fusion
protein transport into the brain was assessed in 418-month-old
mice at 4 and 2 h, corresponding to Cmax of the fusion protein
and the F(ab0)2 fragment in blood, respectively, and measured as
per cent of injected dose per gram brain tissue (% ID per g).
At this point, the fusion protein was taken up ninefold more than
[125I]F(ab0)2-h158, with no difference between tg-ArcSwe and
WT mice (Fig. 2c). When studied 72 h post injection, that is, at
the highest Kp of the fusion protein, it showed a 15-fold higher
brain retention in tg-ArcSwe mice than the F(ab0)2 fragment and
a greater difference between tg-ArcSwe and WT mice (Fig. 2d).
To assess whether the transport across the BBB may be
mediated by the Fc receptor, 10- to 12-month-old WT and
tg-ArcSwe mice were injected with 125I-labelled 8D3 or a Fab
fragment of 8D3 (Fab-8D3), which lacks the Fc fragment, and
ex vivo brain uptake was measured 4 h post injection. Fab-8D3
was equally well distributed to the brain as 8D3, strongly
indicating that the high brain concentrations observed with 8D3
and the fusion protein were due to TfR-mediated transcytosis and
independent of the Fc domain of the 8D3 antibody (Fig. 3a).
As an additional control, a fusion protein consisting of 8D3 and a
F(ab0)2 fragment of an antibody (Synagis; specific for the
respiratory syncytial virus) of the same IgG isoform as h158,
but lacking a specific target in the brain, was also generated.
The generated 8D3-F(ab0)2-Synagis fusion protein retained its
binding to TfR, but did not bind to Ab protofibrils (Fig. 3b,c).
Ex vivo studies were also performed with the irrelevant fusion
protein [125I]8D3-F(ab0)2-Synagis, which had a similar half-life in
blood as [125I]8D3-F(ab0)2-h158. Similar to 8D3, the brain
retention of the irrelevant fusion protein was elevated in WT
mice 4 h post injection. At 72 h post injection, the brain retention
of the irrelevant fusion protein was the same in tg-ArcSwe and
WT mice (Fig. 3d,e) and of the same magnitude as observed with
[125I]8D3-F(ab0)2-h158 in WT mice.
These
experiments
demonstrated
that
compared
with
F(ab0)2-h158, the fusion protein transport into the brain was
markedly increased in both tg-ArcSwe and WT mice. Hence, the
carrier-mediated transcytosis was not dependent on animal type
or age. However, in WT animals, lacking Ab protofibrils, the
fusion protein was washed out from the brain when systemic
concentrations decreased. Similarly, [125I]8D3-F(ab0)2-Synagis,
which
lacks
a
protofibril-binding
domain,
was
eliminated
from the brains of both WT and tg-ArcSwe mice when the
blood concentration decreased. As a consequence of the fairly
rapid systemic elimination of the fusion protein, Kp increased
in tg-ArcSwe mice over time, but not in WT mice. Moreover,
when compared with the whole antibody mAb158 (ref. 27), Kp
of the fusion protein was more than 20-fold increased 72 h
post injection.
Brain retention follows Ab pathology in transgenic mice. The
brain retention of the fusion protein was measured ex vivo 72 h
post injection in saline-perfused brains of tg-ArcSwe and WT
mice at 4, 12 and 418 months of age to follow the course of Ab
pathology. Brain levels of soluble Ab protofibrils as well as total
(formic acid soluble) Ab40 and Ab42 were determined in the
same mice. We have previously established that total Ab,
measured by ELISA, closely matches Ab plaque load as deter-
mined with immunohistochemistry in tg-ArcSwe mice27. There
was a significant difference in brain retention of the fusion
protein between tg-ArcSwe and WT mice at 12 months (3.5-fold)
and 418 months (6.8-fold), as well as a trend towards increased

 brain concentrations also in the 4-month group (1.3-fold) (Fig. 4a
and
Table
1).
The
WT
animals
showed
constant
brain
concentrations of fusion protein regardless of age. Both soluble
Ab protofibrils and total Ab40 and Ab42 increased over time in
tg-ArcSwe mice, displaying elevated levels of Ab protofibrils
already at 4 months (Fig. 4b). The increase over time in soluble
Ab
protofibril
levels
correlated
closely
with
the
brain
concentrations of fusion protein (Fig. 4c), while total Ab
concentrations increased with a higher rate (Fig. 4d) suggesting
that the Ab targeted by the fusion protein was mainly of soluble
origin. To rule out the possibility that the ligand might be stuck in
the endothelium and not transported into the brain, staining for
the endothelial marker CD31 in combination with nuclear track
emulsion was used to visualize the fusion protein in the brain.
The fusion protein was found in the brain parenchyma without
accumulation in capillaries in 418-month-old tg-ArcSwe mice
(Fig. 4e) but to some extent clustered around the periphery of
congophilic amyloid deposits, suggesting it was bound to a halo of
soluble Ab aggregates, which has been reported to surround the
fibrillar core of amyloid plaques41 (Fig. 4f).
In vivo PET imaging of Ab pathology in transgenic mice. Next,
to evaluate the fusion protein as a PET ligand, it was labelled with
124I, a positron-emitting radionuclide with a half-life of 4.2 days.
Tg-ArcSwe and WT mice of different ages (4, 8, 12 and 18
months) as well as tg-Swe mice (12 and 18 months), with a
delayed age at onset of pathology compared with tg-ArcSwe29,42,
were injected i.p. with B15 MBq [124I]8D3-F(ab0)2-h158 and
PET scanned for 60 min 72 h post injection. Ab pathology could
be clearly visualized in the 12- and 18-month-old tg-ArcSwe mice
while there was no signal in the WT mice (Fig. 5a). In tg-Swe
mice, no specific signal was recorded at 12 months, whereas a
strong signal was seen at 18 months, confirming that the signal
seen in tg-ArcSwe mice was not an effect of the Arctic AbPP
mutation. In a subset of the animals, ex vivo autoradiography was
performed, as a comparison to the results of brain distribution
seen in the PET images. Clinical PET data, including studies
using [11C]PIB, is often quantified as the relative concentration of
the PET ligand in a region of interest to that of a reference region.
When analysing the present PET data from the whole brain,
cortex,
hippocampus,
striatum
and
thalamus
using
the
cerebellum as a reference region, the obtained ratio followed
the disease progression in all studied regions (Fig. 5b). The
cerebellum displayed a low PET signal in all animals at all ages
(Fig. 5a) confirming its suitability as a reference region.
Deiodination of the fusion protein, measured in plasma after
PET scanning, was o5%.
To verify that neurodegenerative pathology characterized by
protein aggregation per se did not lead to increased retention
of
[124I]8D3-F(ab0)2-h158,
18-month-old
(Thy-1)-h[A30P]
a-synuclein transgenic mice (hereafter referred to as tg-a-syn)
were also PET scanned according to the same protocol. The
tg-a-syn mice, like the WT mice, displayed no signal in the
brain (Fig. 5c). In addition, to confirm that the differences in
brain retention observed between AD and WT mice were not due
to increased binding of the 8D3 moiety in the brains of tg-ArcSwe
and tg-Swe mice, 18-month-old tg-ArcSwe and WT mice were
injected
with
B15 MBq
of
the
irrelevant
fusion
protein
[124I]8D3-F(ab0)2-Synagis and PET scanned for 60 min 72 h post
injection. No accumulation in brain could be observed in either
mouse type (Fig. 5d), and when quantified, the concentration
ratios in all studied brain regions in relation to cerebellum
were around 1 (Fig. 5b), confirming that the higher brain
concentrations
observed
with
[124I]8D3-F(ab0)2-h158
in
tg-ArcSwe and tg-Swe compared with WT mice were indeed
due to the Ab protofibril-binding moiety F(ab0)2-h158.
PET imaging correlates with soluble Ab protofibrils. Brains
from the mice subjected to PET imaging were analysed for
Tris-buffered saline (TBS)-soluble Ab protofibrils and total
(formic acid-soluble) Ab40 and Ab42. Cerebellum and the rest of
the brain were analysed separately to enable a direct comparison
with PET results. As displayed in Fig. 6a, cerebellum contained
overall very low levels of Ab protofibrils, but more importantly,
no increase was seen with increased age in either tg-ArcSwe or
tg-Swe mice in direct analogy with PET results. In the rest of the
brain, Ab protofibril levels increased with age after 8 months in
tg-ArcSwe, showing elevated levels at 12 months, that is, at the
same age as Ab was detectable with PET, that were further
increased at 18 months. The same pattern was observed for the
tg-Swe animals, although the increase was seen between 12 and
18 months. Hence, there was no overlap in Ab protofibril levels
between PET-positive and PET-negative animals, which allows to
define a PET detection limit completely separating the groups
(Fig. 6a). For total Ab40 and Ab42, the pattern was different in
tg-ArcSwe mice, with a marked increase in brain Ab concentra-
tions already at 8 months, continuing up to 12 months and then
forming a plateau. Interestingly, unlike soluble Ab protofibril

 levels, total Ab40 and Ab42 levels increased with age also in the
cerebellum, though with several months delay (Fig. 6b,c). The tg-
Swe model showed a large increase in total Ab at 18 months
compared with 12 months, but low levels in the cerebellum at
both ages, possibly because of its later onset of Ab pathology
(Fig. 6b,c). For comparison with the PET data, a brain/cerebellum
ratio of the three different Ab species was plotted against the
brain/cerebellum PET ratio described above (Fig. 6d–f). The tg-
Swe animals were excluded from the Ab40 and Ab42 ratio graphs
since they had extremely high ratios, caused by the low Ab levels
in cerebellum. Whereas a strong correlation was seen between the
Ab protofibril and PET ratios, the total Ab ratios did not correlate
with PET data.
Comparison with [11C]PIB. A subset of the mice that underwent
PET scanning with the fusion protein was also imaged with
[11C]PIB to compare the two ligands in mice with different Ab
pathology (Fig. 7). The 8- and 12-month-old transgenic animals
showed similar [11C]PIB retention in brain as WT animals. The
18-month-old tg-ArcSwe and tg-Swe mice showed some [11C]PIB
retention, mainly in cortical regions, but the brain/cerebellum
ratio was in general lower than the ratio obtained with the fusion
protein and did not reflect the disease progression to the
same extent as the fusion protein did. Radioactivity concentration
(corrected for injected dose) of [11C]PIB and [124I]8D3-F(ab0)2-
h158 was similar in 18-month-old tg-ArcSwe brain (Fig. 7a),

Several new drug compounds intended for treatment of AD have
entered clinical phase II and III studies, but there are limited
possibilities to measure their effects on the molecular level in vivo.
All existing amyloid PET radioligands bind to the b-sheet
structure of insoluble fibrillar Ab. Evidence today points to
soluble forms of aggregated Ab being better correlated with
disease severity and soluble Ab oligomers and protofibrils are
likely to cause the synaptic failure that eventually leads to
dementia. The present study shows for the first time an in vivo
PET image of Ab pathology acquired with an antibody-based
radioligand (Fig. 5). This was achieved by a combination of
TfR-mediated transcytosis to increase BBB penetration and the
use of a well-characterized Ab protofibril selective antibody,
which ensures that Ab aggregates are selectively targeted.
Although mAb158 binds, albeit with a lesser affinity, to Ab
fibrils and monomers in vitro25,27 (Fig. 1c), evidence suggests that

 it primarily targets soluble Ab protofibrils in vivo. When
administered
to
tg-ArcSwe
mice
with
plaque
pathology,
mAb158 selectively reduced brain levels of Ab protofibrils,
without altering the plaque pathology43, unlike other Ab
antibodies of the same isotype44. This is probably because
soluble Ab protofibrils, which are already favoured by mAb158,
are more accessible to the antibody when it enters the brain
parenchyma than the insoluble fibrils deposited in plaques. This
is also reflected in Fig. 4e,f, where in vivo administered fusion
protein appears in the parenchyma and around the periphery of
plaques, where Ab oligomerization has been reported to occur41.
Further, the PET signal and brain retention of the generated
bispecific fusion protein increased with age (Fig. 5), that is, with
progression of Ab pathology in the tg-ArcSwe and tg-Swe mouse
models. Tg-ArcSwe mice exhibit very dense Ab plaque pathology,
similar to that of the human AD brain, with an onset around 6

 months of age42, and an almost linear increase of soluble Ab
protofibrils with age (Figs 4 and 6). Tg-Swe mice display less
dense plaques42 with a later onset and a more rapid increase in
Ab pathology (Fig. 6). Hence, at 12 months of age, higher
concentrations of [124I]8D3-F(ab0)2-h158 was observed in the
brains of tg-ArcSwe compared with tg-Swe mice, while the
opposite was observed at 18 months. The difference between the
two animal models was also evident in the [11C]PIB scans.
[11C]PIB binds poorly to the loose unstructured plaques in tg-Swe
mice brain and thus [11C]PIB concentrations were lower than
[124I]8D3-F(ab0)2-h158 in tg-Swe mice, while the concentration
of the two radioligands was similar in tg-ArcSwe brain. Brain
retention of the fusion protein correlated closely with brain
concentrations of soluble Ab protofibrils in both animal models
(Fig. 4), while total Ab levels, reflecting the plaque pathology,
increased at a higher rate, suggesting that the fusion protein
preferably binds to soluble Ab protofibrils. Furthermore, low
radioactivity was detected with PET in the cerebellum in all age
groups, while it increased with age in the rest of the brain.
Similarly, while the level of soluble Ab protofibrils increased with
age in the whole brain, cerebellum displayed a low and constant
level of protofibrils over time. Thus, the PET brain/cerebellum
radioactivity concentration ratio, which is often used in clinical
PET as a read-out measure, correlated with the brain/cerebellum
ratio of soluble Ab protofibrils (Fig. 6). Such a correlation was not
seen for total Ab, since both Ab40 and Ab42 increased with age
in the cerebellum. These results do not per se exclude that the
radioligand may also to some extent bind to fibrillar Ab in the
brain, possibly in the shape of diffuse deposits.
Taken together, our findings suggest that brain retention of the
fusion protein measured with PET reflects the progression of Ab
pathology. This approach could become an important diagnostic
tool to predict disease stage in AD patients, likely including the
group of patients displaying mainly diffuse plaque pathology45
that are diagnosed falsely as non-AD with the available amyloid
PET radioligands46. Treatment strategies to reduce soluble Ab
aggregates are today studied in late-phase clinical trials, but
biomarkers for evaluating the effects of such treatments need to
be improved. A PET radioligand visualizing soluble Ab aggregates
could bring substantial benefit in assessing emerging Ab-reducing
treatments.
To our knowledge this is the first successful study using an
antibody-based
PET
ligand
for
a
CNS
application.
Since
antibodies are very specific binders, the drawback of large
unspecific binding often experienced with small molecular PET
ligands (including [11C]PIB and analogues) will most likely be
avoided with antibody-based ligands. This study therefore also
demonstrates the feasibility of antibody-based in vivo imaging of
proteins involved in other neurodegenerative disorders, for
example, Parkinson’s disease or frontotemporal lobar degenera-
tion, for which small molecular PET ligands are currently lacking.
Methods
Antibody fragmentation. F(ab0)2-h158 was generated by cleavage of a humanized
variant, BAN2401, of the mouse monoclonal antibody mAb158, selectively binding
to Ab protofibrils, that is, soluble Ab aggregates larger than about 100 kD, eluting
in the void volume on a Size Exclusion Superdex 75 column25. The bacterial
enzyme IdeS (ref. 47), manufactured and distributed as FabRICATOR (Genovis
AB, Lund, Sweden), was used to cleave the antibody. This enzyme cleaves human
IgG at a specific site just below the hinge region, producing a homogenous
preparation of F(ab0)2 fragments. A F(ab0)2 fragment of an antibody against
respiratory syncytial virus, Synagis (Palivizumab; 530300, Apoteket AB, Solna,
Sweden/MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), was generated according to the
same method. Fab-8D3 was generated from the TfR antibody 8D3 (ref. 36)
(MCA2474, AbD Serotec, Oxford, UK) by papain cleavage, according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).
All fragments were purified with CaptureSelect Fc (multi-species) Affinity Resin
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Stockholm, Sweden) to remove Fc fragments and
non-cleaved antibody from the preparation. Purity and size of the fragments were
evaluated with SDS–PAGE under non-reducing conditions. Briefly, samples were
mixed with Laemmli buffer, loaded onto a Novex pre-cast 10–20% Tris-tricine

 polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and run at 125 V for 90 min,
followed by 3 � 15-min wash in water, and staining with Page Blue
(Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Generation of bispecific fusion proteins. F(ab0)2-h158 or F(ab0)2-Synagis and
8D3 were chemically conjugated with the Solulink technology (Solulink protein
conjugation kit; Solulink, San Diego, CA, USA), where each of the conjugated
proteins is modified with one of two linkers, which bind specifically to each other
to form a permanent bond. F(ab0)2-h158 or F(ab0)2-Synagis (3.0 mg ml � 1) was
labelled with succinimidyl-4-formylbenzamide (S-4FB) using a 4.5-fold molar
excess, and 8D3 (3.0 mg ml � 1) was labelled with the complimentary succinimidyl-
6-hydrazino-nicotinamide (S-HyNic) using a 6-fold molar excess. The labelled
proteins were mixed in a 1.5:1 (F(ab0)2:8D3) molar ratio and reacted for 2 h in
room temperature in the presence of 10 mM aniline, which catalyses the reaction.
To purify the fusion protein, the preparation was incubated for 1 h with Cap-
tureSelect Fc (multi-species) Affinity Matrix to specifically deplete the preparation
of unconjugated F(ab0)2 fragments, which lack the Fc domain. After elution from
the resin with 0.1 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.5, the preparation was neutralized with 1 M
Tris and incubated for 1 h with CaptureSelect IgGCH1 (human) Affinity Matrix
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), which specifically binds to the constant domain 1 of
human IgG heavy chain, thus depleting the sample of unconjugated 8D3. The
purified fusion protein was eluted with 0.1 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.5, and analysed
with SDS–PAGE as above.
Ab inhibition ELISA. To assess the 8D3-F(ab0)2-h158 fusion protein’s binding to
different Ab species in solution, an inhibition ELISA was performed as previously
described25. The 96-well plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA) were coated at
þ 4 �C for 2 h, with 45 ng per well of Ab protofibrils and blocked for 1 h with 1%
bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. In the meantime, the fusion protein (0.5 nM)
was incubated with serially diluted Ab monomers, protofibrils or fibrils in a non-
binding 96-well plate (Greiner, Kremsmu
¨nster, Austria) for 1 h on a shaker and
then transferred to the Ab protofibril-coated plate, where it was incubated for
15 min. Fusion protein bound to the plate was detected by a 1-h incubation with
1:2,000 diluted horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-human-IgG-F(ab0)2
(109-036-006, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA).
Signals were developed with K blue aqueous TMB substrate (Neogen Corp.,
Lexington, KY, USA) and read with a spectrophotometer at 450 nm. All Ab and
antibody dilutions were made in ELISA incubation buffer (PBS with 0.1% BSA,
0.05% Tween and 0.15% Kathon). Ab preparations were made as previously
described27 and the (insoluble) fibril preparation was subjected to a brief sonication
(30 s) before the analysis to break-up large fibril assemblies and ensure it would
stay in suspension.

 TfR–Ab protofibril ELISA. The generated 8D3-F(ab0)2-h158 fusion protein was
tested with ELISA for retained binding to TfR and Ab, respectively, before and after
radioiodination. The 96-well plates (Corning Inc.) were coated at þ 4 �C overnight
with 10 ng per well of murine TfR (Sinobiological, Beijing, China) or 25 ng per well
of streptavidin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). After 1 h blocking with 1% BSA in
PBS, biotinylated Ab protofibrils, 4.5 ng per well, prepared as previously
described27, were added to streptavidin-coated wells and incubated for 30 min on a
shaker. A serial dilution of the fusion protein, 125I-labelled or non-labelled, was
added to TfR- or streptavidin/Ab protofibril-coated wells, incubated for 2 h on a
shaker and detected by a 1-h incubation with HRP-conjugated 1:2,000 diluted
anti-mouse-IgG-F(ab0)2 (TfR coat) or anti-human-IgG-F(ab0)2 (streptavidin/Ab
protofibril coat) (115-036-006 and 109-036-006, Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories). Signals were developed and read as above. All antibody dilutions
were made in ELISA incubation buffer. The 8D3-F(ab0)2-Synagis fusion protein
was tested for retained binding to TfR according to the same method.
Animals. Three transgenic models maintained on a C57BL/6 background were
used: the tg-ArcSwe model harbouring the Arctic (AbPP E693G) and Swedish (AbPP
KM670/671NL) mutations; the tg-Swe model with only the Swedish mutation; and
tg-a-syn mice. Tg-ArcSwe mice show elevated levels of soluble Ab protofibrils
already at a very young age and abundant and rapidly developing plaque pathology
starting at around 6 months of age29,42,48. Tg-Swe mice have a later onset of plaque
pathology starting at 10–12 months of age and then increasing with age42. Both
males and females were used and littermates were used as control animals (WT). As
further controls, tg-a-syn mice displaying overexpression of human a-synuclein
(protein involved in Parkinson’s disease)49 were used in the PET experiments. The
animals were housed with free access to food and water in rooms with controlled
temperature and humidity in an animal facility at Uppsala University.
Radiochemistry. Direct radioiodination of the four proteins F(ab0)2-h158, 8D3,
8D3-F(ab0)2-h158 and 8D3-F(ab0)2-Synagis with iodine-125 (125I) for ex vivo
experiments and iodine-124 (124I) for PET experiments was performed using
Chloramine-T (ref. 50). The method is based on electrophilic attack of the phenolic
ring of tyrosine residues by in situ oxidized iodine. Briefly, for 125I labelling, 250
pmoles of antibody/fragment or 65 pmoles of fusion proteins (assumed Mw
(molecular weight) 270 kDa), 125I stock solution (PerkinElmer Inc., Waltham, MA,
USA) and 5 mg Chloramine-T (Sigma Aldrich, Stockholm, Sweden) were mixed in
PBS to a final volume of 110 ml. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 90 s and
subsequently quenched by addition of double molar excess of sodium metabisulfite
(Sigma Aldrich) and dilution to 500 ml in PBS. Fab-8D3 had to be modified with
Bolton Hunters reagent (Sulfo-SHPP)51 (Pierce) before radioiodination to
introduce extra phenolic rings for the iodine to target. Fab-8D3 (1 mg ml � 1 in
PBS) was incubated for 30 min with 100 � molar excess of sulfo-SHPP (50 mM in
H2O) and purified from unbound sulfo-SHPP with a Zeba mini desalting column,
Mw cutoff 7 kDa (Pierce). Modified Fab-8D3 was radiolabelled as above.
For 124I labelling, 58 ml 124I stock solution (Perkin-Elmer Inc.) was pre-
incubated for 10 min with 12 ml 50 mM NaI, before addition of 260 pmoles of fusion
proteins and 40 mg Chloramine-T in PBS to a final volume of 450 ml. The reaction
was allowed to proceed for 120 s and subsequently quenched by addition of 80 mg
of sodium metabisulfite in PBS. The radiolabelled proteins were purified from free
iodine and low-molecular weight components with a disposable NAP-5 size
exclusion column, Mw cutoff 5 kDa (GE Healthcare AB, Uppsala, Sweden),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and eluted in 1 ml of PBS. The yield
was calculated based on the added radioactivity and the radioactivity in the purified
radioligand solution. Labelling was always performed o2 h before each study.
Affinity for Ab protofibrils and/or TfR was tested with ELISA on the same day as
the labelling and the start of the study.
[11C]PIB was synthesized as previously described1.
Injected radioactivity, specific activity, labelling reaction yields for F(ab0)2-h158,
8D3, Fab-8D3, 8D3-F(ab0)2-h158, 8D3-F(ab’)2-Synagis and [11C]PIB are given in
Table 2.
Deiodination of [124I]8D3-F(ab0)2-h158 was assessed in the injection solution
before the experiment and in plasma samples from injected animals after PET
experiments, by separation with Zeba mini desalting columns, where free iodine
was trapped in the column.
Ex vivo studies. Mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane at 2, 4, 24 or 72 h after a
single i.p. injection of [125I]F(ab0)2-h158, [125I]8D3, [125I]Fab-8D3, [125I]8D3-
F(ab0)2-h158 or 8D3-F(ab0)2-Synagis. A blood sample was obtained from the heart
followed by intracardiac perfusion with 50 ml physiological saline during 2 min.
Following perfusion, brains were isolated and the left hemisphere immediately
frozen. The right hemisphere was either immediately frozen (for ex vivo auto-
radiography) or left to incubate in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, before it was
immersed in a sucrose gradient (10, 20 and 30%) in PBS for cryoprotection (for
immunohistochemistry) before being sectioned on a cryostat at � 20 �C.
In addition to the terminal blood samples obtained in all animals, blood
samples (8 ml) were obtained from the tail vein for a subset of animals also at 0.5, 1,
2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48 and 72 h after injection.
Radioactivity in blood samples and in the frozen brain hemisphere was
measured with a g-counter (1480 Wizard, Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland). The brain
and blood concentrations, quantified as % ID per g tissue, were calculated as
follows:
% ID per g ¼ measured radioactivity per gram brain tissue (or blood)/injected
radioactivity.
In addition, the brain-to-blood (Kp) concentration ratio was calculated as
follows:
Kp ¼ measured radioactivity per gram brain tissue/measured radioactivity per
gram blood.
The number of transgenic and WT animals included in the ex vivo and PET
studies and injected radioactivities of the different radioligands are given in
Table 2. Values for % ID per g and Kp are summarized in Table 1.
Positron emission tomography. In vivo brain distribution of [124I]8D3-F(ab0)2-

and of [124I]8D3-F(ab0)2-Synagis in tg-ArcSwe (n ¼ 2) and WT (n ¼ 1) was
visualized with PET during 60 min 72 h post i.p. administration of respective
radioligand. The day before injection of 124I-labelled fusion protein, animals were
given water supplemented with 0.2% NaI to reduce thyroidal uptake of 124I. A
subset of the animals, tg-ArcSwe (n ¼ 6), tg-Swe (n ¼ 4) and WT (n ¼ 4), were

At every scanning occasion, the animal was placed in the gantry of the animal
PET/computed tomography (CT) scanner (Triumph Trimodality System, TriFoil
Imaging, Inc., Northridge, CA, USA) and scanned in list mode followed by a CT
examination for 3 min (field of view ¼ 8.0 cm). Mice were scanned in a random
order.
The PET data were reconstructed using a maximum likelihood expectation
maximization (MLEM) two-dimensional algorithm (10 iterations). The CT raw

 files were reconstructed using filter back projection. All subsequent processing of
the PET and CT images were performed in imaging software Amide 1.0.4 (ref. 52).
The CT scan was manually aligned with a T2-weighted, magnetic resonance
imaging-based mouse brain atlas53 containing outlined regions of interests for
hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, cortex and cerebellum. The PET image was then
aligned with the CT, and thus, the magnetic resonance imaging atlas was also
aligned with the PET data. The PET data shown in Figs 5a,c,d and 7a–c are
summed images, that is, representing the average activity during the whole PET
scan. The PET data were quantified as a concentration ratio of the radioactivity in
five regions of interest (whole brain, cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and striatum)
to that in cerebellum.
Biochemical and histopathological analyses. Brain concentrations of soluble Ab
and total Ab were measured as described previously18. In short, mice were saline
perfused and the left hemisphere of each animal was homogenized at a 1:5
weight:volume ratio in TBS with complete protease inhibitors (Roche), using a
tissue grinder with Teflon pestle (2 � 10 strokes on ice). A volume of 400 ml of each
sample was mixed with 400 ml TBS and centrifuged for 1 h at 16,000g to obtain a
preparation of soluble proteins. The supernatants were aliquoted and stored at
� 80 �C until analysis. To obtain a preparation including insoluble proteins found
in amyloid plaques, 270 ml of the original TBS extract was mixed with 730 ml of
concentrated formic acid, to a final formic acid concentration of 70%, followed by
homogenization and centrifugation as above.
In the Ab protofibril ELISA, 96-well plates were coated overnight with 200 ng
per well mAb158, and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS. TBS extracts were diluted 1:25
and incubated overnight at þ 4 �C, followed by detection with biotinylated
mAb158 (0.5 mg ml � 1) and streptavidin-HRP (1:2,000; Mabtech AB). Signals were
developed with K blue aqueous TMB substrate (Neogen Corp., Lexington, KY,
USA) and read with a spectrophotometer at 450 nm.
For ELISA measurement of Abx-40 and Abx-42, 96-well plates were coated
overnight with 100ng per well of polyclonal rabbit anti-Ab40 or anti-Ab42 (Agrisera,
Umeå, Sweden), and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS. Formic acid extracts were
neutralized with 2M Tris and diluted 500–50,000 times depending on Ab content and
incubated overnight at þ 4�C, followed by detection with biotinylated mAb1C3
(0.5mgml� 1)25,26 and streptavidin-HRP (1:5,000; Mabtech AB). Signals were
developed and read as above. All sample and secondary antibody dilutions were made
in ELISA incubation buffer (PBS with 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Tween and 0.15% Kathon).
CD31 immunohistochemistry and nuclear track emulsion autoradiography
were performed on semi-adjacent sections (20 mm) of the right hemisphere,
immunostained for the endothelial marker CD31. First, sections were washed in
PBS and incubated with 3% H2O2 and 10% methanol in water for 15 min.
Nonspecific binding was then blocked using 3% BSA in PBS-Tween (0.1%) for 1 h,
followed by an overnight incubation with 0.5 mg ml � 1 rat anti-mouse CD31
(550274, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) at 4 �C. The sections were then
incubated with 5 mg ml � 1 biotinylated goat anti-rat (BA-9400, Vector Laboratories
Inc., Burlingame, CA) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by PBS washes and a
45-min incubation with avidin/biotin complex (Vector Laboratories). The staining
was then visualized with a 3-min 3,30-diaminbenzidine (DAB) development, for
some sections followed by immersion in Congo red for 45 min. Sections were then
dehydrated in ethanol (70, 95 and 100%) and left to air dry.
Immediately after CD31 and Congo staining, sections were immersed for 3 s in
Ilford K5 emulsion (40 �C), left to air dry for 2 h and stored at þ 4 �C protected
from light. Sections were then developed with Ilford photographic reagents, briefly
counterstained with haematoxylin, dehydrated with ethanol and xylene, and
mounted with DPX mounting medium.
Ex vivo autoradiography. After PET imaging, a subset of the [124I]8D3-F(ab0)2-
h158-injected mice and the [124I]8D3-F(ab0)2-Synagis-injected mice was selected
for ex vivo autoradiography directly after PET imaging. Following saline perfusion,
the right hemisphere was instantly frozen and cryosectioned (20 mm). Two sections
from each animal and 124I-abelled standards of known radioactivity were placed in
an X-ray cassette and exposed to positron-sensitive phosphor screens (MS, Mul-
tiSensitive, PerkinElmer, Downers grove, IL, USA) for 4 days. The plates were
scanned in a Cyclone Plus Imager system (Perkin Elmer) at a resolution of 600 dots
per inch. The resulting digital images were normalized to the standards and con-
verted to a false colour scale (Royal) with ImageJ for comparison with PET images.
Statistics. Results reported are presented as mean±s.d. Data were analysed with
two-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc test. In cases where
the variance was different in the different groups (variance was in general larger in
tg-ArcSwe mice than in WT mice), data were log-transformed before analysis to
adhere with the analysis of variance assumption of equal variance. Pearson’s
correlation was used to analyse correlation of brain uptake of radioligands and Ab
protofibril concentrations.
Study approval. All procedures described in this paper were approved by the
Uppsala County Animal Ethics Board (#C216/11, #C110/11 and #C17/14),
following the rules and regulations of the Swedish Animal Welfare Agency, and
were in compliance with the European Communities Council Directive of 22
September 2010 (2010/63/EU). All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering
and to reduce the number of animals used.
