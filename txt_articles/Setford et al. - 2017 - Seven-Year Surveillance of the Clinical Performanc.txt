There is a recognized need for improved blood glucose mea-
surement system (BGMS) performance in certain clinical set-
tings and for specific patient subgroups which has driven 
more rigorous accuracy and precision requirements for these 
diagnostic devices.1,2 Numerous reports have highlighted a 
clinical need for improved meter accuracy3,4 with respect to 
the adjustment of insulin dosing, minimizing glucose result 
outliers and minimizing the impact of underlying medical 
conditions, such as anemia, on the true glucose result.5 An 
important factor that can influence blood glucose meter per-
formance is the level of sample hematocrit (Hct), especially 
in association with extremes of low or high blood glucose. 
Variations of Hct are particularly evident in specific patient 
subgroups. The performance of selected blood glucose meters 
has recently been evaluated in neonatal blood samples where 
Hct levels ranged from 18-75%6 and in an antenatal clinic 
setting where Hct levels ranged from 31-43%.7 We previously 
reported the accuracy of blood glucose test strips at hypogly-
cemic glucose levels8 in subjects with Hct levels of 25.0-
56.5% and more recently described how BGMS systems 
using this test strip met precision, accuracy, Hct and interfer-
ences

testing

lance to safeguard patients with diabetes from consumer

Abstract
Background: A key approach in enabling people with diabetes to better manage their condition is through self-monitoring 
of blood glucose (SMBG). Any functional SMBG system should demonstrate clinical accuracy across a broad glucose range 
and be insensitive to hematocrit. Furthermore, it should be incumbent on the manufacturer to demonstrate that their 
product continues to meet clinical accuracy claims during product lifetime.
Methods: Test strips from a globally distributed SMBG product were sampled from randomly selected production batches 
as part of the manufacturer’s routine product evaluation process. Clinical accuracy was assessed within diabetes patients 
at 3 clinic sites against a standard reference method and evaluated against system accuracy in accordance with the ISO 
15197:2015 standard (unchanged from ISO 15197:2013 in terms of performance specifications). Data were collected over 7 
years (2010-2016) and comprised 73,600 individual glucose results. Overall clinic performance was assessed, as was accuracy 
at low and high glucose levels and extremes of hematocrit.
Results: Across the 7-year surveillance period, overall test strip clinical accuracy was 97.8% versus the 95% ISO-defined 
minimum criterion with by-year values of 97.0-98.6%. Accuracy at the lowest (≤50 mg/dL) and highest (>400 mg/dL) ranges 
of glucose was 97.0% and 98.3% respectively. Within these low/high blood glucose subpopulations, accuracy at the lower and 
upper first percentile hematocrit ranges, was 98.9%, and 97.1% respectively.
Conclusions: This 7-year surveillance program showed the test strips to have excellent clinical accuracy at the outer ranges 
of subject blood glucose and hematocrit, based on assessment against the ISO 15197:2015 clinical accuracy criterion.

products that do not routinely meet their labeled accuracy 
performance in the field. The Diabetes Technology Society 
(DTS) has created a clinical surveillance protocol containing 
performance targets and analytical testing studies, to be con-
ducted by qualified clinical and laboratory sites.11 It is 
intended that results from this initiative be made available to 
professionals, payers and regulatory agencies to allow 
informed decisions in selecting, prescribing, financing and 
regulating in-market BGMS products. This company-spon-
sored surveillance analysis describes the performance of 
OneTouch© Verio™ test strips, both overall and at the limits of 
Hct and blood glucose distributions, based on a unique and 
extensive dataset of 73,600 individual glucose results gener-
ated from routine clinical testing of randomly selected test 
strip production batches released to the market over a 7-year 
surveillance period.
Methods
Test Strips
The blood glucose test strips comprise a “lower” thin palla-
dium (Pd) film, a spacer of controlled thickness and an 
“upper” gold (Au) electrode (Figure 1). Removal of a rectan-
gular portion of the spacer exposes and defines 2 electrodes 
co-facially opposed across the sensing chamber and separated 
by a distance equal to the spacer width. The glucose sensing 
reagent chemistry is formulated from buffer salts, surfactants, 
potassium ferricyanide mediator and flavoprotein glucose 
dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH) and is deposited and dried onto 
the lower palladium electrode. FAD-GDH enzyme was cho-
sen for its high substrate specificity, non-reactivity toward 
oxygen and minimal maltose interference. During the test, 
enzyme-catalyzed oxidation of glucose results in reduction of 
the FAD moiety within the GDH enzyme. Ferricyanide medi-
ator, being able to diffuse rapidly to the active site of the 
enzyme, is able to accept the electron from the FAD structure. 
This reduced ferrocyanide form of the mediator further 
diffuses to the anode (the Au electrode in seconds (s) 1-4 of 
the assay; the Pd electrode from 4-5 s) where electron transfer 
occurs, thus generating a glucose concentration dependent 
signal that is processed by an on-meter algorithm. A number 
of systems based on this test strip are commercially available, 
but all use the same test strip design.12
Clinic Testing
These test strips have been manufactured by LifeScan Inc 
(Wayne, PA) since 2010 and all associated BGMS systems 
meet the ISO 15197:201513 clinical accuracy requirement for 
in vitro blood glucose monitoring systems for self-testing of 
blood glucose for managing diabetes, across the blood glu-
cose range of 20-600 mg/dL and Hct of 20-60%. To continu-
ously monitor product clinical performance, samples from 
randomly selected representative test strip production batches 
are subjected to clinical accuracy assessment at 3 National 
Health Service (NHS) UK clinic sites: (1) Highland Diabetes 
Institute, Inverness; (2) Department of Diabetes, Royal 
Infirmary of Edinburgh; (3) Birmingham Heartlands Hospital.
Studies were conducted under existing UK Scotland A 
Research Ethics Committee approval (10/S1103/2). Participant 
inclusion criteria required a diabetes diagnosis, informed con-
sent and 20-60% Hct. Tests were performed using test strip 
dedicated meters, with results displayed as plasma-equivalent 
blood glucose values. Because patients may have visited the 
clinical sites on more than 1 occasion during the evaluation, 
and could be tested with more than 1 strip lot per visit, the 
clinical dataset is not entirely composed of unique donors.
For clinical assessment, a participant’s finger was pre-
pared and lanced (fingersticked) according to product use 
instructions and blood applied to the test strip until the 0.4 µl 
sample chamber was filled. Testing was performed by trained 
technicians, thus is more reflective of a system accuracy 
evaluation as defined by the ISO standard with the associated 
system-specific errors that may occur, as opposed to a user 
performance evaluation where additional non-meter-related 
factors may also arise. Results were recorded, in mg/dL, 
after the 5 s test time. Non-numerical values (strip errors) 
were recorded and reviewed on a batch-by-batch basis, 
although an amalgamated record of all data was not kept. In 
addition, in routine manufacturing, all released batches of 
product are first sampled and evaluated in a laboratory set-
ting to ensure the frequency of non-numerical errors are 
within acceptable quality limits. Furthermore, the manufac-
turer maintains both customer complaints and postmarket 
surveillance programs. Where multiple test strip batches 
were assessed in the same clinic, blood from the same finger-
stick sample was applied to additional strips as required. A 
further sample of capillary blood was collected in a heparin-
ized capillary tube for same-day Hct measurement using a 
Hettich Hematocrit 210 capillary centrifuge. The Hct level 
was recorded as the percentage volume of red blood cells 
(RBCs) as a proportion of the total sample volume. An

additional minimum sample of 200 µl capillary blood was 
collected in a 300 µl Microvette Lithium Heparin blood col-
lection tube and centrifuged, with the plasma fraction used 
for glucose determination by the independent reference 
method within 30 min of centrifugation. Test site tempera-
ture was maintained between 20-24°C, at ≤70% relative 
humidity. A maximum of 2 fingersticks were permitted to 
complete all testing procedures.
Reference Instrument
Test strip data were compared against a clinical laboratory 
standard instrument (YSI 2300 STAT PLUS™ blood glucose 
analyzer; Yellow Springs Instrument Co Inc, Yellow Springs, 
OH). Instruments were subject to routine maintenance and 
calibrated prior to all quality control and blood testing, lin-
earity being assessed prior to each usage with standards of 
50, 200, 500, 700 mg/dL glucose. Duplicate plasma glucose 
measurements were recorded on 2 separate instruments, with 
individual values and absolute difference values required to 
meet predefined acceptance criteria. The mean of the dupli-
cate measurement values was used for clinical accuracy 
assessment.
Analysis
Minitab v16 (Minitab Inc, PA, USA) was used for statistical 
evaluations. A total of 100 qualifying (i.e., within the claimed 
Hct range of the product) sets of values were collected per 
batch, thus requiring a minimum of 100 participants per indi-
vidual batch evaluation. Clinical accuracy was expressed in 
terms of bias to the reference method with analysis being 
evaluated above and below a threshold glucose value. Meter 
values below threshold were expressed as absolute bias (mg/
dL) to reference, with results equal to, or above, being 
expressed as percent bias (pbias) to reference. Two different 
specifications were evaluated (Table 1) with specification 1 
meeting ISO 15197:2015 and specification 2 describing a 
tighter accuracy requirement at low blood glucose (within 
±12 mg/dL of reference at <80 mg/dL).
Results
Overall Clinical Accuracy Performance
The total number of clinical glucose measurements obtained 
(N = 73,600) represents the entirety of the data obtained 
under this routine clinical surveillance assessment, with no 
batches or qualifying measurements excluded. The overall 
accuracy of all clinical glucose measurements was assessed 
against the ISO 15197:2015 system performance accuracy 
requirements: (1) 95% of measured glucose values to fall 
within either ±15 mg/dL of the average reference instrument 
measured values at glucose concentrations <100 mg/dL or 
within ±15 % at glucose concentrations ≥100 mg/dL and (2) 
99% of individual glucose measured values to fall within 
zones A and B of the Consensus Error Grid (CEG) for type 1 
diabetes.14 The pbias of the data relative to the reference 
method is also shown graphically as an empirical cumulative 
distribution (“Mountain”) plot,15 that aids visualization of 
data distribution relative to reference. System performance 
was also assessed against the tighter accuracy specification 
(Table 1). Data are shown in Table 2 and Figure 2.
Across the 7-year surveillance period, overall clinical 
accuracy of the test strips against the ISO specification was 
97.8% with by-year values of 97.0-98.6% (Table 2). When 
assessed against the tighter ±12 mg/dL / ±15% specification, 
a 7-year value of 97.7% was recorded with yearly values 
varying from 96.7-98.6%. CEG data (Figure 2a) showed that 
≤99.97% of results were within the A and B zones (A: clini-
cal accurate measurements with no effect on clinical action; 
B: altered clinical action with little or no effect on clinical 
outcome) for any given year (99.99% for the 7-year period, 
Table 2). Over this period, 6 values from 73,600 were in the 
C zone (altered clinical action, likely to affect clinical out-
come) with no data points within zones D and E. The 
Mountain plot (Figure 2b) illustrates the distribution of the 
clinic data relative to reference, in terms of pbias for all val-
ues (for presentation purposes, the upper and lower 1 percen-
tile values are not shown). Unlike the ISO-based evaluation, 
this analysis expresses all data points, irrespective of glucose 
levels, in terms of relative bias (pbias) as opposed to absolute 
bias for glucose values <100 mg/dL. The distribution appears 
to be continuous with no obvious anomalies with asymmetry 
in the direction of higher pbias. The upper and lower pbias 
values (16.85% and –11.55% respectively) correspond to the 
upper and lower 2.5% percentile values, that is, 95% of 
results occur within these pbias limits.
Clinical Accuracy by Glucose Concentration
The distribution of blood glucose values measured by the 
reference method is shown in Figure 3a. Values ranged from 
27 to 829 mg/dL (mean = 201.2 mg/dL, SD = 93.1 mg/dL). 
ISO 15197:2015 stipulates that a given strip batch be tested 
across distributed glucose concentrations and defines 7 
“buckets” spanning the range ≤50 to >400 mg/dL. ISO clini-
cal accuracy was assessed across these buckets (Table 3). 
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and Endocrine 
Society agree16 that patients should be alerted to the possibil-
ity of developing hypoglycemia at a self-monitored plasma 
glucose concentration of ≤70 mg/dL. Therefore, strip

accuracy within this glucose range is also recorded. Table 3 
shows accuracy to be maintained across all glucose ranges, 
with at least 96.0% of strips meeting the performance 
requirement within a given ISO bucket and at an overall 
amalgamated value of 98.0%. Values of 97.0% and 98.3% 
were obtained within ISO buckets 1 (lowest glucose) and 7 
(highest glucose) respectively and 97.3% of results were 
accurate within the hypoglycemic range.
Clinical Accuracy at Extremes of Hematocrit
The distribution of all 73,600 Hct measurements is shown in 
Figure 3b (Hct mean: 41.2%; SD: 4.3%). The distribution 
was tested for normality (Figure 3c) with the low and high 
values being shown to deviate from normality (P-value 
>0.005). Therefore, the Minitab PERCENTILE(Var, p) func-
tion was used to calculate the lower and upper 1% range with 
Var = Hct and P set to .01 and .99, respectively. This inverse 
empirical fit approach yielded the following Hct distribution 
ranges—lower 1 percentile: Hct 20.5-30.8%; upper 1 per-
centile: Hct 50-59.6%.
The dataset was then split into the ISO 15197:2015 rec-
ommended glucose ranges for system accuracy evaluation 
(“ISO bucket”) and also by proportion of values within the 
hypoglycemic range (≤70 mg/dL). Clinical accuracy data 
were then evaluated within the lower and upper 1 percentile 
Hct ranges (Tables 4a and 4b). For those subjects (n = 814; 
Table 4a) exhibiting the lowest 1 percentile of the clinical 
Hct distribution (20.5-30.8%), test strips met the ISO clinical 
accuracy performance in all applicable glucose buckets (at 
least 96.3% of values meeting specification by bucket and 
96.0% of results [n = 25] accurate in the hypoglycemic 
range).
Within the upper 1 percentile Hct range (50.0-59.6%; 
Table 4b; n = 1370), all values met specification (at least 
95.9% by bucket) except in the >80-120 mg/dL range 
(93.7%). However, it should be noted that for ISO reporting 
purposes, the number of within specification values is 
expressed as a percentage of the total number of values and 
thus amalgamates results from across the full glucose range. 
Therefore, a system can meet the overall 95% accuracy crite-
rion without necessarily meeting it within a given bucket. 
When expressed as amalgamated glucose performance 
(Table 5) at the lowest and highest Hct extremes, product 
accuracy met both the ISO specification (98.9% and 97.1%,

No data points were recorded within the lowest glucose 
range (≤50 mg/dL; bucket 1) at either the lower and upper 1 
percentile Hct ranges. The data within buckets 2 and 7 reflect 
a set of conditions in which clinical accuracy is assessed 
within the combined outlying distributions of both blood 
glucose and Hct. In such cases, performance remains accu-
rate with at least 95.9% of values meeting specification in

Discussion
Clinical Accuracy Performance
This ongoing, long-term (7-year) manufacturer-led surveil-
lance evaluation demonstrates the sustained clinical accu-
racy of the manufactured test strips and represents the 
performance of multiple test strip lots and a total of 73,600 
individual meter results. By year, across all glucose levels, 
ISO system accuracy requirements were consistently met. 
This evaluation allowed the collection of a large number of 
capillary blood samples with abnormally high and low glu-
cose concentrations, including 2515 results at very high glu-
cose >400 mg/dL) and 1723 results within the clinically 
important hypoglycemic range (≤70 mg/dL).
Evaluation of ISO system performance accuracy for BGMS 
products is a formal design validation procedure, requiring a 
minimum of 100 different patients conducted under actual con-
ditions of use over at least 10 days. Given the size of this type 
of test (n = 100), there will be a rarity of patients with very low 
(≤50 mg/dL; bucket 1) or very high (>400 mg/dL; bucket 7) 
glucose. Correspondingly, ISO permits the substitution of 
modified capillary blood samples, in which glucose concentra-
tions are artificially elevated or lowered, to allow these 2 buck-
ets to be filled. The data in this analysis were collected using 
unmanipulated capillary blood samples, direct from fingerstick 
blood, that is, without recourse to manipulation of blood sam-
ples in the higher and lower ISO buckets, thereby presenting a 
rare indication of test strip performance directly from the 
lanced finger of patients with diabetes. In effect, it is the dura-
tion of the analysis and size of the clinic database that has pro-
vided the large number of qualifying values within these 
outlying glucose ranges, thereby providing a measure of prod-
uct performance with unmanipulated capillary blood samples.
The clinic performance discussed above is a measure of 
system performance and thus include all sources of potential 
inaccuracy, such as system-related factors, patient specific 
factors and environmental conditions. As an ISO 15197:2015 
compliant product, design of the test strip component of the 
system was verified to meet the standard with regard to ana-
lytical performance including linearity, measurement repeat-
ability, intermediate measurement precision, interferences, 
temperature, humidity, altitude, and Hct. With regard to the 
latter patient-specific factor, the size of the clinic database 
also allowed test strip performance to be assessed at Hct 
extremes, but also in combination with high and low glucose, 
again with unmanipulated samples. This data evaluation tests 
the “limits” of strip performance by considering clinical 
accuracy for that subset of patients who have abnormally low 
and high Hct. There were no instances of low glucose within 
the extreme Hct populations, but the test strips were found to 
maintain ISO clinic accuracy performance within these pop-
ulations at high glucose thus demonstrating test strip capabil-
ity in the generation of clinically accurate blood glucose 
values to support appropriate treatment choices.
Clinical Relevance
Ensuring accuracy of strip performance is important given 
the variations seen in general patient populations and is 
especially important in specific populations that demon-
strate wider Hct variations. A WHO report on iron defi-
ciency anemia17 found the majority of pregnant women 
assessed had Hct >30% but below the normal range. 
Another report has shown that Hct of pregnant women 
averaged 35%, equivalent to a similar group of women with 
gestational diabetes.18 Providing consistent accuracy across 
the glucose range at these lower Hct levels is therefore 
important throughout pregnancy. Within a hospital diabetes 
outpatient population Hct levels of 26-52%19 and 35-52%20 
have been reported (both these studies reported an average 
Hct of 43%, compared to 41.2% in this current evaluation, 
N = 73,600). Our data confirm that the test strips reliably 
measure blood glucose at both the lowest (≤50 mg/dL) and 
the highest (>400 mg/dL) glucose levels over a Hct range 
that is inclusive of the majority of patients with diabetes 
testing their blood glucose at home. Our extensive dataset 
reflects a broad patient population who, by the very nature 
of their condition, are on multiple medications and have a 
variety of underlying health conditions common to people 
with diabetes. Accuracy across a wide glucose and Hct 
range is important to enable patients and health care profes-
sionals to confidently make treatment decisions (eg, basal 
or bolus insulin dose adjustments) and to ensure patients 
have access to accurate results especially when experienc-
ing episodes of hyper- and hypoglycemia.
Strip Design and Hematocrit Performance
The fact that the test system demonstrates accuracy at 
extremes of Hct at high and low glucose values demonstrates 
the capability of this BGMS system with respect to Hct. This 
capability has been created through careful strip design and 
includes a 3-step potential waveform and corrective algo-
rithm21 as will now be described.
The Hct level of a blood sample is a measure of 
 
the red blood cells (RBCs) present. These cells act as 
impermeable barriers to the free diffusion of mediator, 
resulting in longer diffusion paths according to Fricke’s 
“obstruction” principles.22 For example, under the condition

of the upper 1 percentile of Hct (50.0-59.6%), the increased 
diffusional pathways of ferricyanide to the enzyme and fer-
rocyanide (reduced mediator) to the anode will result in a 
significant decrease in the subsequent Faradaic response of 
the strip. In addition, as the RBC count increases, so there is 
a disproportionate increase in viscosity further influencing 
the sample’s hydrodynamic properties and effective diffu-
sion coefficient of the mediator, resulting in a further attenu-
ation of system response. In the test strip, the reagent layer 
is applied only to the bottom Pd electrode. Over seconds 1-4 
of the assay, the Au electrode acts as the anode and enzyme 
reacts with glucose at the Pd electrode, generating a local 
increase in the concentration of ferrocyanide mediator. A 
proportion of this reduced mediator will diffuse to the Au 
electrode and be oxidised, the magnitude of which will be 
related to blood glucose concentration, enzymatic turnover 
and sample hydrodynamic properties. Thus this portion of 
the current/time response can be used to indicate the diffu-
sional properties of the ferrocyanide anion and hence Hct 
properties of the sample. In the final 1 s of the assay, the Pd 
electrode serves as the anode and provides a measure of glu-
cose in the sample, due to the localized enzyme reaction and 
concomitant accumulation of reduced mediator in the vicin-
ity of the electrode. By evaluating the current response 
across the 5 s of the assay, an accurate Hct and interference 
adjusted glucose response is obtained, as demonstrated by 
the clinical accuracy performance reported here.
Conclusions
This proactive and ongoing surveillance program describes 
the clinical accuracy of a globally commercially available 
test strip, representing a unique and extensive database of the 
clinical accuracy of this product across a broad demographic 
of patients with diabetes within three hospital outpatient 
clinics over a seven-year period. The test strips met their 
intended and labeled ISO 15197:2015 clinical accuracy 
requirements across the claimed Hct and glucose range, 
including under the combined conditions of both high and 
low glucose and Hct.
