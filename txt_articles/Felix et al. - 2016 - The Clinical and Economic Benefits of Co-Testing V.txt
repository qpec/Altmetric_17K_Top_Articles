Abstract
Background: Consensus United States cervical cancer screening guidelines recommend use of combination Pap
plus human papillomavirus (HPV) testing for women aged 30 to 65 years. An HPV test was approved by the
Food and Drug Administration in 2014 for primary cervical cancer screening in women age 25 years and older.
Here, we present the results of clinical-economic comparisons of Pap plus HPV mRNA testing including
genotyping for HPV 16/18 (co-testing) versus DNA-based primary HPV testing with HPV 16/18 genotyping
and reflex cytology (HPV primary) for cervical cancer screening.
Methods: A health state transition (Markov) model with 1-year cycling was developed using epidemiologic,
clinical, and economic data from healthcare databases and published literature. A hypothetical cohort of one
million women receiving triennial cervical cancer screening was simulated from ages 30 to 70 years. Screening
strategies compared HPV primary to co-testing. Outcomes included total and incremental differences in costs,
invasive cervical cancer (ICC) cases, ICC deaths, number of colposcopies, and quality-adjusted life years for
cost-effectiveness calculations. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses were performed.
Results: In a simulation cohort of one million 30-year-old women modeled up to age 70 years, the model
predicted that screening with HPV primary testing instead of co-testing could lead to as many as 2,141 more
ICC cases and 2,041 more ICC deaths. In the simulation, co-testing demonstrated a greater number of lifetime
quality-adjusted life years (22,334) and yielded $39.0 million in savings compared with HPV primary, thereby
conferring greater effectiveness at lower cost.
Conclusions: Model results demonstrate that co-testing has the potential to provide improved clinical and
economic outcomes when compared with HPV primary. While actual cost and outcome data are evaluated,
these findings are relevant to U.S. healthcare payers and women’s health policy advocates seeking cost-effective
cervical cancer screening technologies.
Introduction
O
ver the past several decades, cervical cancer
screening in the United States has reduced mortality
rates of cervical cancer from the leading cause of cancer
death in women to ranking 14th. Increased adoption of the
Pap test as a screening tool was largely responsible for the
decrease through improved detection and treatment of cer-
vical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).1 Yet even with the
success of cervical cancer screening, it is estimated that this
year in the United States there will be 12,900 new cases of
cervical cancer and 4,100 women will die of this disease.2
Technological advances such as vaccination and testing for
human papillomavirus (HPV) have the potential to decrease
cervical cancer rates even further.3–6 Because of its greater
sensitivity, combination Pap plus HPV testing is the preferred
screening strategy for women 30 to 65 years of age compared
with HPV testing or Pap testing alone, while Pap testing is

 recommended for women aged 21 to 30 due to the lower
specificity of HPV testing in this population.7 Controversies
regarding appropriate cervical screening intervals and the
recent United States Food and Drug Administration approval
of an HPV test as a primary cervical cancer screen have raised
questions among patients, clinicians, and payers regarding
the clinical and cost effectiveness of various cervical cancer
screening strategies.8,9
Data from several European trials has shown effectiveness
for HPV primary screening, with some studies concluding
that HPV primary testing can support screening intervals as
long as 6 years.10,11 Additionally, a cost-effectiveness study
performed using the results of the ARTISTIC trial deter-
mined that HPV testing would be cost effective as a primary
screen.12 However, these studies have generally compared
HPV primary screening with Pap testing rather than Pap plus
HPV testing and have been performed in populations with
single-payer healthcare and differing screening utilization
compared with the United States.13,14 Long-term, large-
population studies investigating the cost effectiveness and
clinical impact of HPV primary screening are necessary to
determine the effectiveness of HPV primary screening in the
United States compared with the current clinical practice of
Pap plus HPV testing.
At least one attempt has been made to use modeling data to
estimate the cost effectiveness of different cervical screening
strategies in the United States.15 However, several factors
that may affect the cost effectiveness of HPV primary
screening have not been investigated. First, the cost effec-
tiveness of HPV testing in women aged 25 to 29 has not been
assessed. Because the Food and Drug Administration ap-
proved an HPV primary test for women ‡25 years of age,9 a
model including various screening strategies at different ages
would provide practical insights into the cost effectiveness of
HPV primary testing in varying age populations where it may
be used. Second, while the previous analysis compared Pap
plus HPV without genotyping to HPV primary with geno-
typing, the impact of HPV genotyping on cost effectiveness
has not previously been incorporated into economic model-
ing when comparing Pap plus HPV testing with HPV primary
screening.15 Reflex genotyping for HPV 16/18 following Pap
plus HPV testing is recommended by the major guidelines
(when the result is a negative Pap and a positive HPV test),7
so comparing Pap plus HPV screening paradigms that in-
clude genotyping with an HPV primary screening paradigm
that includes genotyping is necessary for a like comparison.
Third, while the previously published model analyzed Pap
plus HPV testing using a DNA-based assay, the majority of
US diagnostic labs use mRNA-based HPV testing performed
with Pap.16
Although guidelines currently recommend a 5-year screen-
ing interval for Pap plus HPV, this continues to be the subject of
ongoing debate in the scientific community as clinical data5 and
modeling analyses from the U.S. Preventative Services Task
Force (USPSTF) suggest that screening intervals longer than
3 years may result in substantial increases in cervical cancer
morbidity and mortality.8,17 The USPSTF model developed by
Kulasingam et al. found that co-testing intervals of 3 versus
5 years would result in 4.73 versus 7.44 cases of cervical cancer
and 0.74 versus 1.35 deaths per 1,000 women, increasing in-
vasive cervical cancer (ICC) cases by 57% and cervical cancer
deaths by 82%.17 Kinney et al.8 calculated that this increase
predicts that adopting 5-year screening intervals willresult in an
additional 1 in 369 screening-compliant women contracting
ICC and 1 in 1,639 screening-compliant women dying of cer-
vical cancer. Additionally, surveys of practice patterns suggest
that the majority of clinicians continue to screen with Pap plus
HPV more often than every 5 years,18–20 versus the 2012
guidelines, which recommended a 5-year interval.7 Because of
these data and published guidance for HPV primary re-
commending that ‘‘re-screening after a negative primary high-
risk HPV screen should occur no sooner than every 3 years,’’21
we believe that a comparison of Pap plus HPV (i.e., ‘‘co-
testing’’) and HPV primary with equivalent intervals of 3 years
is most clinically relevant.
We attempted to address the limitations of previous work
with the objective of performing clinical and economic
comparisons between cervical cancer screening with Pap plus
HPV mRNA testing with genotyping for HPV 16/18 (co-
testing) versus primary HPV DNA testing with genotyping
for HPV 16/18 and reflex cytology (HPV primary). We
present the results of an analysis using a hypothetical cohort
of one million 30-year-old women modeled up to age 70 in
which co-testing and HPV primary were assessed by com-
paring the number of cases and deaths from invasive cervical
cancer (ICC), expected and predicted quality-adjusted life
years (QALYs), and estimated costs associated with each
screening strategy. We also present the results of sensitivity
analyses investigating the effects of test performance char-
acteristics, mortality rates, and a comparison of HPV primary
testing with Pap testing in women 25 to 29 years of age.
Methods
Economic model overview
In this study, we perform clinical-economic comparisons
of two cervical cancer screening strategies: Pap plus HPV
mRNA testing with genotyping (co-testing) and primary
HPV DNA testing with genotyping and reflex cytology (HPV
primary). The model estimates the impact within a cohort of
one million 30-year-old women receiving high-risk HPV
screening. Outcomes and costs were simulated from ages 30
to 70 years. Differences in outcomes between the two sce-
narios were accumulated annually across each cohort’s
life span. Outcomes included total and incremental differ-
ences in costs, ICC cases, ICC deaths, and QALYs for cost-
effectiveness calculations. Data for this study was derived
from published literature and analysis of insurance claims
records.
Study population
To conduct the evaluation, we constructed a hypothetical
cohort of one million women with cervical cancer risk rep-
resentative of today’s population who would be eligible to
begin cervical cancer screening at age 30 years per consensus
guidelines.7 The cohort was assumed to experience the same
natural history of disease, screening, diagnosis and treatment
in a U.S. healthcare setting and followed from age 30 years to
age 70 years. A secondary analysis of women aged 25 to 29
years was also performed.
Development of ICC has a long latency period and nearly
all cases are associated with persistent high-risk HPV sub-
types.22 Key clinical attributes include high rates of natural

 clearance of HPV infection and age-dependent persistence
among these strains. Disease progression follows a defined
series of stages, from initial HPV infection through pro-
gressive stages of cervical lesion development prior to the
appearance of cervical cancer.23
Screening strategies
We modeled cervical cancer screening strategies using
concurrent ThinPrep liquid-based cytology and high-risk
HPV mRNA testing (ThinPrep� Pap Test and Aptima� HPV
Assay, Hologic, Inc.) with HPV16 18/45 genotyping (co-
testing) compared with primary high-risk HPV DNA testing
with HPV 16/18 genotyping (cobas� HPV test, Roche Di-
agnostics US) with reflex for women testing HPV positive but
HPV 16/18 negative to ThinPrep liquid-based cytology (HPV
primary). Women were assumed to be screened once every
3 years for either screening strategy.7,8,19 In the model, wo-
men testing positive entered a 1-year retesting cycle until a
negative screen was observed; colposcopies were performed
on women testing positive for (a) HPV 16/18; (b) other high-
risk HPV and cytology ‡ ‘‘atypical squamous cells of unde-
termined significance’’ (ASCUS); (c) cytology ‡ ‘‘low grade
squamous intraepithelial lesion’’ irrespective of the HPV
results; or (d) other high-risk HPV for two consecutive
screening tests. Colposcopies were assumed to be 100%
sensitive and specific for CIN2/3. Compliance with periodic
screening was held constant at 100% for all testing strategies
for the sake of equalizing the analytical comparisons and
eliminating bias against tests with lower sensitivity from a
factor exogenous to the focus of our analyses. In addition, we
chose not to incorporate adherence into the modeling ana-
lyses because one-half of the 12,000 women diagnosed with
cervical cancer in the United States in 2012 had not been
screened within 5 years,24 and screening compliance varies
widely and is dependent upon factors such as age, education,
and socioeconomic status.25 With consideration of this im-
portant evidence, we felt that incorporating treatment ad-
herence had the potential for generating misleading results
rather than adding to the clinical relevance of our approach.
Model structure
A health state transition (Markov) model with 1-year cy-
cling was developed in TreeAge Pro 2015 (TreeAge Soft-
ware, Inc.) using epidemiologic, clinical, and economic data
from healthcare databases and published literature. Numer-
ous researchers have developed population-level natural
history models of the development and progression from
initial HPV status through development of ICC.23,26,27 The
conceptual foundation and structure of these models are
similar and have served as the basis for health policy and
guidelines development over the past 15 to 20 years.23
Probabilities used to model natural history of viral clearance,
disease progression, and regression were taken from a large
federally funded epidemiology modeling program housed at
the USPSTF,23 except where noted.
In this health-state transition model, cohort women were
assumed to be in one of seven mutually exclusive health
states: HPV HR (-), HPV HR (+), CIN1, CIN2, CIN3, ICC,
and dead. Within the dead state, patients could either die from
ICC or all other causes (Supplementary Fig. S1; Supple-
mentary Data are available online at www.liebertpub.com/
jwh). At the end of each annual cycle, women could either
remain in the current state, transition to a more severe disease
state or death, or transition to a less severe health state. Age-
specific transition probabilities of high-risk HPV infection,
CIN clearance, progression, and regression are detailed in
Table 1.
Model inputs
Test performance was defined as the sensitivity and
specificity of the overall screening strategy and is detailed in
Table 2. Base case sensitivity and specificity estimates were
defined based on previously reported values for detecting
CIN3. 28 Because these values were derived from a study that
evaluated co-testing utilizing cytology review without
automated imaging and HPV testing utilizing a DNA-based
assay, the following adjustments were made: co-testing
sensitivity was increased from 76.2% to 82.0% to account for
the increased sensitivity of cytology with automated imag-
ing;29 and co-testing specificity was increased from 81.5% to
85.3% to account for the increased specificity of mRNA-
based HPV testing.30–33
Costs were modeled from the perspective of a U.S.
healthcare payer and are reported in 2014 U.S. dollars. Our
cost accounting approach was comprehensive and included
all costs associated with diagnostic tests and procedures
(including colposcopy and biopsy), additional and repeat
testing, medical office visits, cancer treatment costs, and end-
of-life care. Costs for diagnostic tests and procedures were
derived based on the number of diagnostic tests performed
and unit cost data from current payment levels using the
Truven Health Analytics MarketScan� Research Databases
(Truven Health Analytics). For example, the cost for HPV
primary screening included the sum of the test cost and the
cost of additional reflex testing based on disease prevalence
and test performance characteristics. Treatment costs for
CIN2 or CIN3 were taken from a recent study on the costs of
care for these patients,34 and treatment of CIN2/3 was as-
sumed to be 100% successful. CIN1 was assumed to not be
treated and therefore did not incur added costs if discovered.
Costs for treating ICC were split into three components to
account for high initial costs of care and lower costs in sub-
sequent years for surviving patients.35 For terminal ICC pa-
tients, an additional cost accounting for end-of-life care was
added to either the initial or subsequent year depending on the
age of death.35
Model outcomes
The primary outcome measure was total direct medical
costs per woman screened. Direct costs as defined above
(screening, diagnostic follow-up, and treatment), were sum-
med during each year and summed over the course of 40
years from 30 to 70 years of age. Additional outcomes in-
cluded the cumulative number of ICC cases, ICC-related
deaths, number of colposcopies, overall cost of screening and
diagnosis, and overall cost of treatment.
We also examined the cost effectiveness of each screening
strategy using the cost per QALY. Cost effectiveness is re-
presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
This ratio represents the efficiency of a screening strategy
compared with the next best alternative. We defined an ICER
threshold of US$50,000 per QALY as good value for a U.S.

associated with each health state in our model are summa-
rized in Table 2.
Nationwide projection
For policy makers, we also projected the potential eco-
nomic and clinical impact of each screening strategy on the
total U.S. population. For each outcome, total costs, ICC
cases, and ICC deaths, we first ran the model for individual
cohorts in 5-year increments (e.g., starting at age 30 for 40
years, age 35 for 35 years, age 40 for 30 years, etc.) to reflect
the impact that could be expected if a scenario was im-
plemented immediately across a cross-section of the U.S.
population. For each outcome, the model generates the
marginal impact for the age group. Total costs or ICC cases
and ICC deaths equal the marginal impact estimated in each
age-stratified cohort times the female U.S. population in each
age category. Net impact was estimated based on the net
difference summed across the population.
Sensitivity analyses
We conducted one-way deterministic sensitivity analyses
on selected parameters, including test performance charac-
teristics, prevalence rates, mortality rates, and costs. In ad-
dition to comparing co-testing to HPV primary in women ‡30
years of age, we also explored the impact of HPV primary

 versus cytology with ASCUS reflex to high-risk HPV among
women aged 25 to 29 years who initiate screening at age
25. Estimated rates of disease progression and regression
and test-performance characteristics vary between the
USPSTF and other recently published models (Supplemen-
tary Table S1).15,23 We compared the outcomes among this
patient population to determine the potential impact of ini-
tiating frontline screening with HPV at age 25.
Results
Model results
The results of the model analyses comparing co-testing
with HPV primary are shown in Table 3. The patient popu-
lation for the model analysis is composed of a hypothetical
cohort of one million women aged 30 years undergoing al-
ternative cervical screening strategies over 40 years. Lifetime
cumulative costs of screening and management per patient
equaled $2,326 for co-testing and $2,365 for HPV primary.
For co-testing, screening and diagnosis costs equal $1,319
and $1,007 respectively, while for HPV primary, they are
$1,129 and $1,236 respectively. The model calculated lower
overall total costs associated with co-testing compared with
HPV primary, representing an overall savings of $39 over the
course of a woman’s lifetime.
Co-testing resulted in a slight decrease in lifetime col-
poscopies per woman compared with HPV primary (2.227 vs.
2.232 respectively), representing 4,557 fewer colposcopies in
the one-million-woman cohort. In addition, co-testing re-
sulted in more true positive colposcopies per woman com-
pared with HPV primary (0.127 vs. 0.122 respectively) and
fewer false positive colposcopies (2.101 vs. 2.111). These
numbers represent 5,206 more true positive colposcopies and
9,763 fewer false positive colposcopies across the entire
cohort.
HPV primary testing was calculated to result in as many as
21 additional ICC cases per 10,000 women screened and 20
additional ICC deaths per 10,000 compared with co-testing.
The model also calculated a greater number of QALYs per
women screened for co-testing at 23.01 compared with HPV
primary at 22.99. These results demonstrate a greater effec-
tiveness and lower cost of co-testing that dominates the HPV
primary screening strategy.
With the results translated to the one-million-woman co-
hort, the model predicted that as many as 2,141 ICC cases and
2,041 ICC deaths could be prevented with co-testing vs HPV
primary screening. Co-testing demonstrated a greater number
of lifetime QALYs (22,334) and yielded $39.0 million in
savings compared with HPV primary.
Nationwide projection
The model results were used to calculate a projection to
demonstrate the impact at the U.S. national level (Table 4).

 model predicts approximately 150,000 additional ICC cases
and more than 100,000 additional ICC deaths using an HPV
primary approach compared with co-testing. This represents
an overall additional lifetime cost of approximately $4.4
billion for HPV primary.
One-way sensitivity analysis
A one-way sensitivity analysis was performed on the
model to test the influence of several key parameters. The
primary factors tested were test performance for co-testing
and HPV primary screening, costs of the tests and treatments,
and 5-year survival for invasive cervical cancer. The ranges
of values used for each of the factors in the sensitivity anal-
ysis can be found in Table 5.
Tornado diagrams were created for each of the four major
outcomes of interest: cumulative total costs; QALYs; ICC
cases per 10,000; and ICC deaths per 10,000 women. All four
analyses show that both clinical and cost outcomes are highly
sensitive to the performance of the screening tests. Figure 1A
shows the results of the one-way sensitivity analysis for the
net difference of the cumulative total costs. The difference in
cumulative total costs between co-testing and HPV Primary
screening ranged from -$179 per woman (i.e., cost savings
conferred by co-testing) to $111 per woman (i.e., additional
cost conferred by co-testing). Total costs were most sensitive
to the specificity of co-testing, followed by specificity of
HPV primary, sensitivity of HPV primary, and then sensi-
tivity of co-testing. When the specificity of co-testing ap-
proached the high value of 88.7%, co-testing saved $166 per
woman when compared with the base case savings of $39.
When the specificity of co-testing was set to 81.5%, the
specificity of DNA-based co-testing reported by Cox et al.,28
co-testing resulted in an incremental cost of $111 per woman.
In the other three analyses, the most influential parameter was
the sensitivity of HPV primary followed by the sensitivity of
co-testing.
Figure 1B–D shows the results of the one-way sensitivity
analysis varying the test performance characteristics of co-
testing and HPV primary for the clinical outcomes of QA-
LYs, ICC cases, and ICC deaths. In the simulation, sensitivity
analysis demonstrated that co-testing provided clinically
superior outcomes (greater QALYs, fewer ICC cases, fewer
ICC deaths) compared with HPV primary across the entire
range of inputs.
Sensitivity analysis for women 25–29 years old
A second sensitivity analysis was performed to determine
the impact of transition probabilities cited in Huh et al.15 and
Kulasingam et al.23 on women aged 25 to 29 years. Huh et al.
generally cites a higher rate of progression to the various
health states as well as a higher rate of regression when
compared with the USPSTF data used by Kulasingam et al.
(Supplementary Table S1).15,23
Overall, both sets of transition probabilities demonstrate that
cytology with ASCUS reflex has greater cost savings in our
model; however, cytology has a slightly higher number of ICC
cases but not ICC mortality when compared with HPV primary
(Supplementary Table S2). Use of USPSTF data progression
tables resulted in a greater number of net ICC cases per 10,000
compared with using the Huh progression tables (0.51 vs. 0.26).
Both progression tables found a similar number of net ICC
deaths per 10,000 (0.03 vs. 0.02). Using the Huh data, HPV
primary generated an ICER of $611,818 compared with an
ICER of $426,667 with USPSTF data, indicating that HPV
primary is not cost effective compared with cytology in women
screened between the ages of 25 and 29 years using either
USPSTF or Huh data as inputs (Supplementary Table S2).
Sensitivity analysis for ICC mortality calibrated
to Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
Program data
A third sensitivity analysis was performed to test the impact
of calibrating ICC mortality rates (Table 1), which were held
constant in the model for all simulation years in the base-case
analysis, against multiyear survival curves derived from Sur-
veillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program
cervical cancer data to reflect the tapering effect observed in
AJCC stage 1 survival after 5 years following diagnosis.38 To
replicate this effect in the model data, all ICC mortality rates
were reduced by 50% after the fifth year of simulation post
diagnosis (i.e., the ICC mortality rates in Table 1 were halved
for women with ICC diagnosis who survived to year 6 and
beyond). The impact of making this change on modeling

 analysis results was small (Supplementary Table S3). As ex-
pected, the number of ICC cases remained unchanged relative
to the base-case analysis, but the number of ICC deaths de-
creased by about 33% and 30% for co-testing and HPV pri-
mary respectively. The impact on QALYs was negligible and
the impact on costs was small, with the net difference in total
costs only decreasing from $39 in cost savings per woman to
$15 in cost savings per woman over the 40-year simulation
time horizon. In terms of cost effectiveness, co-testing con-
ferred greater benefit (more QALYs) at less cost compared
with HPV primary and therefore remained the economically
dominant screening strategy.
Although useful for benchmarking purposes, as described
here, notable limitations of the SEER mortality data include
the fact that the data are 15–28 years old and geographically
limited (collected in 1988 to 2001 from 12 SEER geographic
areas covering only about 14% of the total U.S. population),
the data pertain specifically to women diagnosed with

 squamous carcinoma of the cervix uteri, and the data were
derived from the pool of women who may or may not have
been screened by co-testing, HPV primary, or another
screening method prior to their diagnosis.
Discussion
As discussions about appropriate cervical cancer screening
strategies examine net outcomes by balancing benefits and
harms, clinical-economic comparisons are useful to guide
decision making. This model demonstrates that among
women 30 to 70 years of age, cervical cancer screening using
co-testing at 3-year intervals may be more cost effective and
prevent more cases of cervical cancer compared with primary
HPV screening at 3-year intervals. Co-testing dominated the
HPV primary screening strategy, with lower lifetime
screening and management costs and greater effectiveness as
determined by ICC cases and deaths without increasing
harms as measured by lifetime colposcopies/woman.
The model predicted an additional 2,141 ICC cases and
2,041 ICC deaths over 40 years with HPV primary compared
with co-testing among the hypothetical one-million-woman
cohort. These results are due to the greater sensitivity of co-
testing compared with HPV primary. The small difference
between ICC cases and deaths is the result of an increased
likelihood of detecting cancer at a later, less treatable stage
using HPV primary. Projected nationally, these results predict
a substantial decrease in human and monetary costs over a
lifetime of screening. Additionally, slightly higher QALYs per
woman were calculated for co-testing. Sensitivity analyses
determined that test sensitivity for both HPV primary and co-
testing had a greater impact than specificity or ICC survival
rate in determining QALYs or ICC mortality. These results
suggest that test sensitivity is vital to consider when attempting
to improve outcomes of cervical screening programs.
Calculations for cost effectiveness generated similar re-
sults for HPV primary testing and co-testing, with an ap-
proximate savings of $39 per woman, over 40 years, using co-
testing. Improvements in total costs were most sensitive to
variations in test specificity followed by test sensitivity. With
cost differences approaching neutral (i.e., $39 cost savings in
the base case, and a tight range of -$179 to $111 per screened
woman in the sensitivity analyses), comparisons should focus
on the improved clinical outcomes and net health benefits of
co-testing. In the model, co-testing provided superior clinical
outcomes (greater QALYs, fewer ICC cases, fewer ICC
deaths) compared with HPV primary across a range of test
performance characteristics.
Regarding strategies for women between 25 and 29 years of
age, a sensitivity analysis evaluating cost effectiveness of cy-
tology with ASCUS reflex and HPV primary determined that
HPV primary was not cost effective compared with cytology
with ASCUS reflex in this age group. A DNA HPV test was
approved for use as a primary screen in women ‡25 years of
age,9 even though HPV testing of women under 30 years of age
is controversial due to the additional harms and lack of estab-
lished additional clinical benefit associated with HPV testing.7,39
These data provide further evidence that while HPV primary
testing in women 25 to 29 years of age is likely to identify more
cases of CIN2/3, very few of these CIN2/3 cases will progress to
ICC before the age of 30. Thus, the model shows that HPV
primary testing in this age group offers minimal benefit in cancer
detection, does not decrease mortality from cervical cancer, and
is not cost effective compared with cytological testing. Ad-
ditionally, HPV primary testing in this age group resulted in a
higher number of colposcopies. While the harms of excess
colposcopies were not modeled here, recommendations that
women younger than 30 years of age not be tested for HPV are
the result of data suggesting that the harms associated with
overtreatment are a significant consideration in this population.7
This analysis has several advantages over prior clinical-
economic models that have evaluated HPV primary screening
as an alternative cervical screening strategy for women in the
United States. An analysis published by Huh et al. in 2015
using data from the ATHENA trial compared cost effective-
ness of HPV primary testing with genotyping and cytology
triage to HPV primary testing with cytology triage only and co-
testing without genotyping in a hypothetical cohort of women,
leading to a conclusion that use of an HPV test with geno-
typing improves cost effectiveness.15,40 However, direct
comparison between HPV primary testing vs co-testing using
HPV tests with genotyping for both strategies was not assessed
until this study. A cost-effectiveness study conducted using
data from a UK study found that HPV primary screening may
be cost effective compared with cytology alone, but the study
was performed in a population with a national health system,
with markedly differing cervical screening compliance com-
pared with the United States.12 A cost-effectiveness analysis
using a Dutch model found that HPV screening was cost ef-
fective compared with cytology alone, but the authors cau-
tioned that HPV primary screening is affected by being ‘‘well
controlled’’ and evenly distributed throughout the popula-
tion.41 Thus, caution should be used when extrapolating from
European to U.S. cost-effectiveness studies.
There are several limitations to this model. As mentioned
above, unscreened and underscreened women were not
considered. This is relevant, as approximately half of all
cervical cancer cases in the United States occur in this pop-
ulation.42 Assumptions of 100% sensitivity and specificity
for colposcopy and 100% success for CIN2/3 treatment also
limit the application of model results to real-world condi-
tions, as does our failure to account for the impact of in-
creasing rates of HPV vaccination.43 HPV vaccination rates
will affect the cervical cancer rate as well as the cost effec-
tiveness of cervical cancer screening strategies. Finally, this
analysis is limited by the lack of long-term data regarding
HPV primary screening. Large-scale longitudinal studies are
needed to determine the effectiveness of HPV primary
screening strategies in U.S. women.
In summary, mRNA-based co-testing with HPV 16/18
genotyping dominated the DNA-based HPV primary screen-
ing with HPV 16/18 genotyping, with lower lifetime screening
and management costs combined with fewer colposcopies as
well as lower ICC incidence and mortality. Although it iden-
tifies more cases of CIN2/3, the addition of HPV testing to
cytology in women 25 to 29 years of age provides minimal
benefit in cancer detection, does not decrease mortality from
cervical cancer, and is not cost effective compared with cy-
tological testing.
Conclusion
More than 50 years after the introduction of the Pap test,
cervical cancer remains a significant public health burden,
614
FELIX ET AL.
 underscoring the need for a clinically effective screening
approach. The recent introduction of an HPV test for primary
screening has re-opened the discussion regarding the optimal
cervical screening paradigm. The results of this model
demonstrate that co-testing has the potential to provide im-
proved clinical and economic outcomes when compared with
HPV primary. While actual cost and outcome data are eval-
uated, these findings are relevant to U.S. healthcare payers
and women’s health policy advocates seeking cost-effective
cervical cancer screening technologies.
