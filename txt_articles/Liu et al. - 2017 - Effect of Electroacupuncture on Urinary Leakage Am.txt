IMPORTANCE Electroacupuncture involving the lumbosacral region may be effective for
women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI), but evidence is limited.
OBJECTIVE To assess the effect of electroacupuncture vs sham electroacupuncture for
women with SUI.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, randomized clinical trial conducted at 12
hospitals in China and enrolling 504 women with SUI between October 2013 and May 2015,
with data collection completed in December 2015.
INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 18 sessions
(over 6 weeks) of electroacupuncture involving the lumbosacral region (n = 252) or sham
electroacupuncture (n = 252) with no skin penetration on sham acupoints.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was change from baseline to week 6
in the amount of urine leakage, measured by the 1-hour pad test. Secondary outcomes
included mean 72-hour urinary incontinence episodes measured by a 72-hour bladder diary
(72-hour incontinence episodes).
RESULTS Among the 504 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 55.3 [8.4] years), 482
completed the study. Mean urine leakage at baseline was 18.4 g for the electroacupuncture
group and 19.1 g for the sham electroacupuncture group. Mean 72-hour incontinence
episodes were 7.9 for the electroacupuncture group and 7.7 for the sham electroacupuncture
group. At week 6, the electroacupuncture group had greater decrease in mean urine leakage
(−9.9 g) than the sham electroacupuncture group (−2.6 g) with a mean difference of 7.4 g
(95% CI, 4.8 to 10.0; P < .001). During some time periods, the change in the mean 72-hour
incontinence episodes from baseline was greater with electroacupuncture than sham
electroacupuncture with between-group differences of 1.0 episode in weeks 1 to 6 (95% CI,
0.2-1.7; P = .01), 2.0 episodes in weeks 15 to 18 (95% CI, 1.3-2.7; P < .001), and 2.1 episodes in
weeks 27 to 30 (95% CI, 1.3-2.8; P < .001). The incidence of treatment-related adverse events
was 1.6% in the electroacupuncture group and 2.0% in the sham electroacupuncture group,
and all events were classified as mild.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among women with stress urinary incontinence, treatment
with electroacupuncture involving the lumbosacral region, compared with sham
electroacupuncture, resulted in less urine leakage after 6 weeks. Further research is needed
to understand long-term efficacy and the mechanism of action of this intervention.

 S
tress urinary incontinence (SUI) is defined by the Inter-
national Continence Society as an involuntary loss of
urine on physical exertion, sneezing, or coughing.1
The prevalence of stress urinary incontinence is as high as 49%
and varies according to the population studied and the defi-
nition of stress urinary incontinence.2 SUI causes psychologi-
cal burden, affects relationships, lowers physical productiv-
ity, and decreases quality of life in women.3 Yet, few effective
therapies are available for treating SUI.
Acupuncture may be an effective treatment option for
SUI. Electroacupuncture has been found to decrease urine
leakage.4 However, effects of acupuncture on SUI remain
uncertain because of the small sample size, poor study
design, and high risks of bias in previous clinical trials.5
The main objective of this study was to assess the effect
of electroacupuncture involving the lumbosacral region, com-
pared with sham electroacupuncture, in reducing urine leak-
age in women with SUI.
Methods
Study Design
This multicenter, randomized, participant-blinded, sham elec-
troacupuncture–controlled clinical study was conducted at 12
hospitals in China. The institutional review board at each site
approved the study protocol (Supplement 1).6 Written in-
formed consent was obtained from all participants.
Participants
Women with SUI were recruited from hospitals and commu-
nities via poster and newspaper advertisements. Participants
were eligible if they were 40 to 75 years old; reported invol-
untary urine leakage on effort, exertion, sneezing or cough-
ing (that ceased when the stress ended); and had inconti-
nence pad weight gain greater than 1 g in the 1-hour pad test.7
The main exclusion criteria were urge, mixed, or other types
of urinary incontinence (Supplement 1). Participants were not
compensated for study participation. Participants'self-
reported ethnicity information was routinely collected with-
out ethnic discrimination.
Randomization and Masking
Eligible participants were randomly assigned to receive
either electroacupuncture or sham electroacupuncture via a
central randomization system for clinical research using
a 1:1 ratio. Randomization was stratified by enrollment site
in a block size of 6. The participants, outcome assessors, and
statisticians were blinded to treatment allocation.
To help maximize blinding of participants, a pragmatic
placebo needle was used (similar to the Streitberger design8)
and sham electroacupuncture design was used. In this trial,
adhesive pads were used in both groups; thus, the blunt-
tipped placebo needle provided participant-blinding effects
with a similar appearance to conventional needles but no
skin penetration.9 The sham electroacupuncture design
included a connecting cord with a broken inner wire with
no actual current output. To test the participant-blinding
effects, 2 hospitals were randomly selected from the study
sites. All participants from the 2 selected hospitals were
asked to guess whether they had received electroacupunc-
ture or sham electroacupuncture within 5 minutes after one
of the treatment sessions in weeks 3 and 6.
Interventions
Hwato brand disposable acupuncture needles (size 0.30
× 75 mm), pragmatic placebo needles (size 0.30 × 25 mm),
and SDZ-V electroacupuncture apparatuses were used.
Participants in the electroacupuncture group received
acupuncture at bilateral Zhongliao (BL33, located in the
third sacral foramen) and Huiyang (BL35, located 0.5 cun
[≈10 mm] lateral to the extremity of the coccyx) (Figure 1).
After skin disinfection, sterile adhesive pads were placed on
bilateral BL33 and BL35, and acupuncture needles were
inserted through the adhesive pads approximately 50 to 60
mm into the skin. Needle insertion followed an angle of 30°
to 45° in an inferomedial direction for BL33 and a slightly
superolateral direction for BL35. Following needle insertion,
small, equal manipulations of twirling, lifting, and thrusting
were performed on all needles to reach de qi (a composite of
sensations including soreness, numbness, distention, heavi-
ness, and other sensations), which is believed to be an essen-
tial component for acupuncture efficacy.10 Paired electrodes
from the electroacupuncture apparatus were attached trans-
versely to the needle handles at bilateral BL33 and BL35. The
electroacupuncture stimulation lasted for 30 minutes with a
continuous wave of 50 Hz and a current intensity of 1 to 5 mA
(preferably with the skin around the acupoints shivering
mildly without pain). Participants received 3 treatment ses-
sions per week (ideally every other day) for 6 consecutive
weeks, 18 sessions in total.
Participants in the sham electroacupuncture group re-
ceived sham electroacupuncture with a pragmatic pla-
cebo needle on sham acupoints. The sham BL33 point was
1 cun (≈20 mm) lateral to BL 33 and the sham BL35 point was
1 cun (≈20 mm) horizontal to BL 35 (Figure 1). Procedures, elec-
trode placements, and other treatment settings were the same
as in the electroacupuncture group but with no skin penetra-
tion, electricity output, or needle manipulation for de qi.
Key Points
Question Is electroacupuncture involving the lumbosacral region
effective in reducing urine leakage for women with stress
urinary incontinence?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 504
women, the mean decrease in urine leakage, measured by the
1-hour pad test from baseline to week 6, was 9.9 g with
electroacupuncture vs 2.6 g with sham electroacupuncture,
a significant difference.
Meaning Among women with stress urinary incontinence,
treatment with electroacupuncture involving the lumbosacral
region, compared with sham electroacupuncture, resulted in less
urine leakage after 6 weeks.

 Throughout the trial, the participants were treated sepa-
rately to prevent communication and were discouraged from
receiving any antiincontinence treatments, and participants
receiving such treatments were asked to document them.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the
amount of urine leakage measured by the 1-hour pad test at
week 6. A preplanned subgroup analysis according to the SUI
severity per baseline amount of urine leakage (mild, 1.1-9.9 g;
moderate,10-49.9g;severe,≥50g)11wasperformedforthepri-
mary outcome. The 1-hour pad test was performed according
to the International Continence Society instructions12 at base-
line and at weeks 2 and 6 (eAppendix 1 in Supplement 2).
In brief, participants wore a preweighed pad, drank 500 mL
water in 15 minutes, and then performed various strenuous ac-
tivities including going up and down stairs, coughing, run-
ning, and others. Afterwards, the pad was reweighed to mea-
sure the amount of urinary leakage.
Although no clinically meaningful difference has been
established, the 1-hour pad test is the only pad test with a
standardized procedure for urinary incontinence.13 With a
specificity of 65% to 89%,14 the 1-hour pad test has a high
adherence rate.15 Its results demonstrated a positive rela-
tionship with urine leakage symptoms16 and significantly
correlated with the quality-of-life questionnaire scores.17
Nonetheless, conflicting results exist in the literature
regarding the reproducibility of both 1-hour18,19 and 24-hour
pad tests.20,21 Considering the wide variation of repeated
1-hour pad tests (mean, 10 g [range, −44 to 66 g),18 the
reproducibility of the 1-hour pad test may not be as good as
the 24-hour test, which has a repeatability of 0.72 (Lin con-
cordance correlation coefficient).20
Secondary outcomes included the change from baseline
in the amount of urine leakage at week 2; the mean 72-hour
urinary incontinence episodes measured by a 72-hour blad-
der diary (72-hour incontinence episodes) during weeks 1 to
6, 15 to 18, and 27 to 30; the proportion of participants with
at least 50% decrease from baseline in the amount of urine
leakage measured by pad at week 6 and in the mean 72-hour
incontinence episodes during weeks 1 to 6, 15 to 18, and 27
to 30; the participant-reported severity of SUI (mild, leaking
several drops; moderate, soaking the underwear; severe,
soaking the outerwear22) during weeks 1 to 6, 15 to 18, and
27 to 30; the change from baseline in the validated Chinese
version International Consultation on Incontinence
Questionnaire-Short Form23 scores (range, 0 [best]-21
[worst] outcomes, and 2.52 as minimal clinically important
differences24); and the participants’ self-evaluation of
therapeutic effects (no help, little help, medium help, great
help) at weeks 6, 18, and 30; the number of urine pads used;
and use of other treatments for SUI during weeks 1 to 6, 7 to
18, and 19 to 30.
Dataforthe72-hourincontinenceepisodesandparticipant-
reported SUI severity were extracted from a 3-day bladder di-
ary completed by participants at baseline and at weeks 2, 4,
6, 15 to 18, and 27 to 30. In the diary, participants docu-
mentedurinaryincontinenceepisodesandactivitiesatthetime
of occurrence, fluid intake, and the severity of incontinence
over 3 consecutive days. For weeks 1 to 6, 15 to 18, and 27 to
30, the mean72-hour incontinence episode values were cal-
culated as the weekly average, and the worst participant-
reported degree of urine incontinence was used as the sever-
ity of SUI. The International Consultation on Incontinence
Questionnaire-Short Form assesses the influence of urinary in-
continence on quality of life during the previous 4 weeks.
It measures frequency and amount of leakage, overall effects
on quality of life, and the type of incontinence.23
Adverse events were documented throughout the trial.
Based on their potential association with the acupuncture nee-
dling procedure, adverse events were categorized by acupunc-
turists and related specialists as treatment-related or non–
treatment-related within 24 hours of occurrence.
Statistical Analysis
Based on the results of a previous electroacupuncture study,4
a sample size of 144 participants per group was estimated to
provide 90% power to detect a between-group difference of
1 g of urine leakage measured by the 1-hour pad test, assum-
ing a standard deviation of 2.61 and a 2-sided significance level
of 5%. To compensate for a 20% loss to follow-up and the pre-
specified subgroup analysis, the sample size was increased to
250 participants in each group.
The primary outcome was analyzed according to the
intention-to-treat principle. The change from baseline in
the amount of urine leakage at week 6 was analyzed by fit-
ting a mixed-effect model using baseline value as a covari-
ate, treatment as a fixed effect, and site and interaction
between site and treatment as random effects accounting
for center differences.

 The same approach was used for the change from base-
line in the amount of urine leakage at week 2. The changes
from baseline in mean 72-hour incontinence episodes and
International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-
Short Form scores were analyzed using a mixed-effect model
with repeated-measures approach using baseline as a co-
variate; treatment, visit, and treatment × visit interaction as
a fixed effect; and site and interaction between site and treat-
ment as random effects. The analyses of participants with at
least 50% reduction from baseline in the amount of urine
leakage and mean 72-hour incontinence episodes were per-
formed using a generalized linear model. For other continu-
ous variables, comparisons between treatment groups
were assessed using the t test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test as
appropriate. Categorical variables were compared using the
Fisher exact test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test as appropriate.
Kappa analysis was used to determine whether participants
correctly guessed their group assignment at a higher rate
than would be expected by chance.
Missing data on the primary outcome were imputed using
the multiple imputation method under the missing-at-
random assumption (eAppendix 2 and eTable 1 in Supplement
2). Four sensitivity analyses were conducted for the primary
outcome. The preplanned analysis used a control-based pat-
tern model to evaluate sensitivity to missing data departure
from the assumption, and 3 posthoc analyses evaluated
whether the analyses could have diluted the estimates of treat-
ment effect (eAppendix 3 in Supplement 2). The posthoc sub-
group analysis was conducted by adding an interaction be-
tween the baseline amount of urine leakage and treatment into
the mixed-effect model.
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version
9.4 (SAS Institute Inc) with a 2-sided P value of less than .05
considered significant. No adjustment was made for multiple

Results
Between October 8, 2013, and May 15, 2015, we screened 987
participants for eligibility, of whom 504 (mean [SD] age,
55.3 [8.4] years) were randomly assigned to receive either
electroacupuncture (n = 252) or sham electroacupuncture
(n = 252). Among the randomized participants, 482 (95.6%)
completed the study (Figure 2). Multiple imputation was used
for the missing data in 18 participants (6 in the electroacu-
puncture group and 12 in the sham electroacupuncture group).
Baseline characteristics were similar between groups except
for age (Table 1).
For the primary outcome, the mean amount of urine
leakage measured by the 1-hour pad test was 18.4 g (95% CI,

 group compared with the sham electroacupuncture group
had a decrease of at least 50% in the amount of urine leakage
at week 6 (between-group difference, 43.0% [95% CI, 35.0%-
50.9%]; P < .001) (Table 2).
At baseline, there were 7.9 72-hour incontinence epi-
sodes among participants in the electroacupuncture group
and 7.7 in the sham electroacupuncture group. Change in
mean number of 72-hour incontinence episodes from base-
line was greater in the electroacupuncture group than the
sham electroacupuncture group with between-group differ-
ences of 1.0 episode (95% CI, 0.2-1.7 episodes; P = .01) during
weeks 1 to 6, 2.0 episodes (95% CI, 1.3-2.7 episodes; P < .001)
during weeks 15 to 18, and 2.1 episodes (95% CI, 1.3-2.8 epi-
sodes; P < .001) during weeks 27 to 30. A higher proportion
of participants in the electroacupuncture group compared
with the sham electroacupuncture group showed at least
50% reduction in mean number of 72-hour incontinence epi-
sodes with between-group differences of 15.0% (95% CI,
6.9% to 23.2%; P < .001) during weeks 1-6, 25.6% (95% CI,
16.9% to 34.3%; P < .001) during weeks 15 to 18, and 25.6%
(95% CI, 16.9% to 34.2%; P < .001) during weeks 27 to 30.
Compared with the sham electroacupuncture group,
the electroacupuncture group had a greater decrease from
baseline in the total International Consultation on Inconti-
nence Questionnaire-Short Form score with between-group
differences of 1.5 points (95% CI, 0.7-2.3 points; P < .001)
at week 6, 2.3 points (95% CI, 1.4-3.2 points; P < .001) at week
18, and 2.5 points (95% CI, 1.5-3.4 points; P < .001) at week 30
(Table 2). The electroacupuncture group had higher improve-
ment in participant-reported SUI severity and better self-
evaluation of therapeutic effects (Table 3). No differences
were found between the 2 groups in weekly mean number of
urine pads used (except weeks 19-30), the number of partici-
pants using urine pads, or other treatments (Table 2).
Treatment-related adverse events, including hematoma
and fatigue occurred among 1.6% of participants in the elec-
troacupuncture group and 2.0% in the sham electroacupunc-
turegroup(Table4).Non–treatment-relatedadverseeventsoc-
curred infrequently (eTable 6 in Supplement 2).
At week 3, 31 of 41 participants in the electroacupunc-
ture group vs 29/42 participants in sham electroacupuncture
group guessed their treatment to be electroacupuncture
(κ coefficient = 0.07, 95% CI, (−0.13 to 0.26); P = .63); at week
6, the numbers were 32/42 participants in the electroacupunc-
ture group vs 25/39 participants in sham electroacupuncture
group (kappa coefficient = 0.14, 95% CI, (−0.06 to 0.34);
P = .22) (eTable 7 in Supplement 2).

 Discussion
Over a 6-week treatment period, electroacupuncture involv-
ing the lumbosacral region showed a greater reduction in the
amount of urine leakage than sham electroacupuncture. The
effects persisted 24 weeks after treatment. The incidence of
adverse events was low.
Objective and quantitative assessments of urinary in-
continence provide direct evidence for the therapeutic assess-
ment of an intervention. Similar to a previous electroacupunc-
ture study,25 electroacupuncture involving the lumbosacral
region decreased the amount of urine leakage measured by
the 1-hour pad test. In this study, the decrease in the amount
of urine leakage in the electroacupuncture group was 9.9 g
after treatment, while previous trials reported a decrease of
5.1 g after 8 weeks of pelvic floor muscle training and 8.9 g
after 12 weeks of pelvic floor muscle training.26,27 A 50% or
more decrease in the amount of urine leakage was consid-
ered to be a clinical improvement.28 In this study, 64.6%
of participants in the electroacupuncture group had a de-
creaseofatleast50%intheamountofurineleakageaftertreat-
ment.Thus,resultsofthisstudydemonstratedthatelectroacu-
puncturehadaclinicallymeaningfulbenefitindecreasingurine
leakage in women with SUI.
Urinary incontinence frequency during daily life is
another important assessment for SUI. In this trial, the de-
creasesinthe72-hourincontinenceepisodesintheelectroacu-
puncture group were consistent with the previous findings
of electroacupuncture treatment25 and were similar to the
effects of pelvic floor muscle training29 and duloxetine.30
The proportion of participants with at least a 50% reduction
in the mean 72-hour incontinence episodes (clinically
meaningful)31 in the electroacupuncture group was 67.5% dur-
ing weeks 27 to 30 and is similar to 69.8% after pelvic floor
muscle training.29
In this trial, 85.4% of participants reported at least me-
dium help from electroacupuncture at week 6; this was simi-
lartotheparticipants’satisfactionrate(84.8%)withpelvicfloor
muscle training.29 The decreases from baseline in the Inter-
national Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short
Form score following electroacupuncture at week 18 and week
30 were clinically significant and comparable to a pelvic floor
muscle training regimen.29
The mechanisms of acupuncture for SUI remain unclear.
Intrinsic urethral sphincter deficiency and urethral hypermo-
bility caused by weak pelvic floor muscles have been pro-
posed as the main pathophysiologies.32 Pelvic floor electric
stimulation could increase the maximum urethral closure
pressure.33 Electroacupuncture involving the lumbosacral re-
gion could cause muscle contraction and simulate pelvic floor
muscle training.34 Both techniques were found effective in
treating SUI.33,34 Results of this trial are consistent with these
previous findings.33,34 Additionally, denervation of the pel-
vic floor has also been linked with SUI.35 Electroacupuncture
may stimulate S3 via BL33 and the pudendal nerve via BL35
at the lumbosacral region.34 Thus, electroacupuncture may fa-
cilitate the reinnervation and strengthening of pelvic floor
muscles, improving symptoms of SUI. These potential rela-
tionships may also account for the delayed effects of elec-
troacupuncture after treatment in this study.
This study has some limitations. First, no clinically mean-
ingful difference was defined for the 1-hour pad test. Second,
the amount of urine leakage was not assessed during the 24-
weekfollow-up.Third,theparticipantblindingassessmentwas
only performed in 2 of the 12 centers. Fourth, the use of fixed
block randomization could not prevent bias from the predic-
tion of treatment allocation in participants. Fifth, no adjust-
ment was made for multiple comparisons for secondary out-
comes. Sixth, the 18 sessions of electroacupuncture treatment
over 6 weeks may be burdensome. Seventh, electroacupunc-
ture procedures in the study can be technically challenging.
Conclusions
Among women with stress urinary incontinence, treatment
with electroacupuncture involving the lumbosacral region
compared with sham electroacupuncture resulted in less
urine leakage after 6 weeks. Further research is needed to
understand long term efficacy and the mechanism of action
of this intervention.
