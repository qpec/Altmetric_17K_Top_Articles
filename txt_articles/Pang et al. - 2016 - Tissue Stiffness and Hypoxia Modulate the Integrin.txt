Abstract
Breast tumors are stiffer and more hypoxic than nonmalig-
nant breast tissue. Here we report that stiff and hypoxic micro-
environments promote the development of breast cancer stem-
like cells (CSC) through modulation of the integrin-linked
kinase ILK. Depleting ILK blocked stiffness and hypoxia-depen-
dent acquisition of CSC marker expression and behavior,
whereas ectopic expression of ILK stimulated CSC development
under softer or normoxic conditions. Stiff microenvironments
also promoted tumor formation and metastasis in ovo, where
depleting ILK significantly abrogated the tumorigenic and met-
astatic potential of invasive breast cancer cells. We further
found that the ILK-mediated phenotypes induced by stiff and
hypoxic microenvironments are regulated by PI3K/Akt. Anal-
ysis of human breast cancer specimens revealed an association
between substratum stiffness, ILK, and CSC markers, insofar as
ILK and CD44 were expressed in cancer cells located in tumor
regions predicted to be stiff. Our results define ILK as a key
mechanotransducer in modulating breast CSC development
in response to tissue mechanics and oxygen tension. Cancer Res;

Introduction
The mechanical stiffness of the cellular microenvironment,
dominated by the composition and crosslinking of the extracel-
lular matrix (ECM), is a key modulator of cell fate (1, 2). For
example, human mesenchymal stem cells differentiate down
distinct lineages depending on the stiffness of their underlying
substratum (1, 3), and matrix stiffness regulates epithelial plas-
ticity by controlling the induction of epithelial–mesenchymal
transition (4). Increased matrix stiffness enhances tumor cell
invasiveness and dissemination (5, 6), and can direct the trans-
formation of mammary epithelial cells (7). In contrast, tumors
grown in mice with disorganized, compliant ECM architecture are
minimally invasive (8). Stiff ECM has been found to promote
tumor progression through the induction of signaling pathways
downstream of integrins and PI3K (9).
In addition to increased stiffness, invasive breast cancers are
frequently hypoxic (10). Tumor hypoxia correlates with poor
prognosis and decreased survival in breast cancer patients
(11, 12). Hypoxia can activate signaling pathways that regulate
cancer stem-like cells (CSC; ref. 13), a distinct population of
cancer cells with enhanced proliferative and invasive character-
istics (14). Under hypoxic conditions, breast cancer cells express
CSC-associated markers, including CD44, Nanog, CD49f, and
ALDH (15–19). Hypoxic conditions also promote pluripotency
and viability of CSC populations (20, 21).
Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a crucial mediator of signal
transmission from the ECM. ILK interacts with b1-integrin and
transmits extracellular signals from the ECM to regulate cellular
activities including anchorage-dependent growth and survival,
migration, invasion, differentiation, and tumor angiogenesis
(22). Elevated expression of ILK has been closely associated with
high-grade human tumors (23, 24) and ILK has been shown to
activate oncogenic pathways to promote tumor progression (25).
However, it remains unclear how the expression of ILK and its
downstream signaling are regulated in the stiff, hypoxic micro-
environments common to invasive cancers. Because ILK is a
critical adaptor used by cancer cells to sense their surrounding
microenvironment, we hypothesized that matrix stiffness and
hypoxia could affect ILK signaling in breast cancer cells to regulate
breast CSC-associated gene expression and cellular behaviors.
Here, we used engineered synthetic substrata to recapitulate the
mechanical properties of the normal mammary gland as well as
that of breast tumors. We investigated how the mechanical
properties and oxygen tension in the tumor microenvironment
affect the formation of breast CSCs. We found that breast CSC
markers are activated synergistically in response to stiff, hypoxic
conditions, and that ILK is an essential regulator of breast CSCs.

 genotyping, tested for mycoplasma contamination (DDC Med-
ical), and were used before passage 20 and within 6 months
after resuscitation. To reduce the expression of ILK, cells were
transduced with lentiviral particles carrying short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) against ILK (sc-35667-V and sc-35666-V, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) or control lentivirus expressing a scrambled
shRNA sequence. Stable shRNA-expressing clones were pro-
duced according to the manufacturer's instructions and selected
using puromycin. All cells were maintained in a humidified
incubator held at 37�C and 5% CO2.
To investigate the effect of matrix stiffness, cells were cultured
on synthetic substrata of different compliances conjugated with
fibronectin, which were prepared as described previously (4).
Cells were seeded at a density of 500,000 cells/cm2 on synthetic
substrata and cultured for 72 hours at 37�C in either humidified
normoxic conditions (95% air and 5% CO2) or in a modular
incubator chamber (Billups-Rothenberg, Inc.) filled with hypoxic
gas (94% N2, 1% O2, and 5% CO2).
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent according to the
manufacturer's instructions, followed by cDNA synthesis using
the Verso cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific). Transcript levels
were measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) using a
Bio-Rad Mini Opticon instrument and iTaq Universal SYBR Green
Supermix (Bio-Rad). Amplification was followed by melting
curve analysis to verify the presence of a single PCR product.
Primers specific for GFP, ILK, ITGB1, CD44, Nanog, CD49f,
VEGF-A, and 18S rRNA are listed in Supplementary Table S1
(Supplementary Information). The expression level of each
mRNA was normalized to that of 18S in the same sample.
Time-lapse imaging and cell tracking
Time-lapse imaging was performed using a Nikon Ti-U inverted
microscope equipped with a stage top incubator maintained at
37�C in a 5% CO2, 90% relative humidity atmosphere (Pathology
Devices, Inc.). Images were acquired every 30 minutes using a Plan
Fluor 10�/0.3 NA air objective (Nikon) and a Hamamatsu Orca-
100 camera. Individual GFP-labeled cells were tracked from the
aligned image sequences using the "Manual Tracking" plugin in
ImageJ.
Immunoblotting analysis
Samples were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer
(Pierce Biotechnology) supplemented with a protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche). Equal amounts of total protein were separated
by standard electrophoresis using 4–12% gradient NuPage gels
(Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose mem-
branes, which were then blocked and incubated overnight with
primary antibodies at 4�C. Antibodies used for immunoblotting
were: rabbit anti-b1-integrin (1:1,000; Abcam), rabbit anti-ILK
(1:1,000; Abcam), rabbit anti-Nanog (1:1,000; Novus Biologi-
cals), mouse anti-CD44 (1:1,000; Novus Biologicals), and rabbit
anti-GAPDH (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology). After washing,
blots were probed with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:5,000; Cell
Signaling Technology) for 1 hour. Blots were incubated with ECL
Plus Western Blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare) for 5
minutes and signals were detected with a FluorChemE Imager
(Cell Biosciences, Inc.).
Soft agar assay
Approximately 5,000 cells were resuspended in serum-free
DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 0.35% agar and plated
in a 12-well plate that contained a base layer of DMEM/F12
medium supplemented with 0.7% agar. Cells were incubated for
14 days and the culture medium was changed twice per week. At
the end of the experiment, colonies were fixed with 4% PFA,
washed with PBS, and imaged. Colonies were counted if they were
larger than 10 mm in diameter as measured using ImageJ.
Aldefluor assay and flow cytometry
Cells
were
harvested
by
trypsinization
using
Accutase
(eBioscience), washed with PBS, and resuspended in flow cyto-
metry staining buffer (eBioscience). Cells were filtered through a
40-mm cell strainer (Corning) to obtain single-cell suspensions.
For intracellular staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized using
Foxp3 transcription factor staining buffer set (eBioscience) prior
to staining. Cells were stained without fixation for cell surface
markers. Cells were incubated with the following fluorochrome-
conjugated antibodies at 4�C for 45 minutes: CD49f (1:200, clone
GoH3; eBioscience), CD44 (1:100, clone IM7; eBioscience), and
Nanog (1:100, clone eBioMLC-51; eBioscience). Stained cells
were washed twice with flow cytometry buffer (eBioscience). To
assess ALDH activity, the ALDEFLUOR fluorescent reagent sytem
(Stem Cell Technologies) was used according to the manufac-
turer's instructions. Stained cells were analyzed using an LSRII
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and data were analyzed using
FlowJo.
Secondary mammosphere formation assay
A single-cell suspension was seeded at a density of 3,000 cells
per well into 12-well ultra-low attachment plates (BD Bio-
sciences). Cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium containing
20 ng/mL EGF and 20 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor, and
culture medium was changed twice per week. After 7 days, primary
mammospheres were collected and disassociated enzymatically
with 0.05% trypsin (Invitrogen) for 5 minutes at 37�C and
mechanically by filtering through a 40-mm cell strainer (Corning).
Single-cell suspensions were replated onto 12-well ultra-low
attachment plates at a density of 1,000 cells per well. After 14
days, secondary mammospheres were transferred to a 12-well
plate. Serum-containing medium was added and secondary mam-
mospheres were allowed to attach to the bottom surface of the
plate. After 12 hours, cells were fixed with 4% PFA and stained
with 0.05% crystal violet. Samples were imaged, analyzed using
ImageJ, and mammospheres were counted if they had a diameter
larger than 50 mm.
Mechanical testing of collagen gels
The elastic moduli of gels comprising different concentrations
of collagen were estimated from unconfined compression experi-
ments, as described previously (26). Briefly, collagen solutions
containing 500-nm fluorescent beads were allowed to gel for at
least 30 minutes at 37�C within circular polydimethylsiloxane
(Sylgard 184) molds. After gelation, the mold was removed and
the cylindrical gel was immersed in PBS. Confocal stacks of the gel
were acquired before and 1 minute after loading a glass coverslip
of known weight to the top of the gel. The thickness of the gel was
estimated from the fluorescence signal of the embedded beads
and, as a first approximation, the measured change in thickness
was used to estimate the elastic modulus of the gel.

 Chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay
Chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assays were per-
formed as described previously (27). Cells were transduced
with recombinant adenovirus encoding GFP at an MOI of 100
for 24 hours prior to implantation. GFP-transduced cells were
resuspended in neutralized rat tail type I collagen (BD Bio-
sciences) at a density of 300,000 cells per 30-mL pellet. Cell-
embedded collagen gels were implanted on the CAM of a
chicken embryo at day 7 of incubation. Tumor formation,
angiogenesis, and metastasis were scored in live embryos 5
days later using a stereomicroscope. Images were acquired
using a Nikon digital camera.
Human breast cancer samples
Breast cancer biopsies were derived from waste surgical
material from de-identified patients, and were formalin-fixed
and paraffin-embedded, as per approval by the Mayo Clinic
Institutional Review Board. Tissue sections were deparaffinized
by placing them into three changes of xylene and rehydrated in
a graded ethanol series. The rehydrated tissue samples were
rinsed in water and sections were subjected to heat antigen
retrieval as described by the manufacturer (DAKO). Slices were
incubated with each primary antibody for 1 hour at room
temperature. Sections were then rinsed with Tris-buffered
saline/Triton-X-100 (TBST) wash buffer, and incubated with
each secondary antibody for 30 minutes. For fluorescent detec-
tion, tissue sections were rinsed 3 times for 5 minutes each with
PBS containing 1.43 mmol/L 40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sections were rinsed with
PBS and coverslips mounted with anti-fade mounting medium
(DAKO). Sections stained for collagen I were rinsed with TBST
wash buffer, and secondary incubation was with DAKO Envi-
sion anti-rabbit, HRP for 15 minutes. Tissue sections were
rinsed with TBST wash buffer and then incubated in 3,30-
diaminobenzidine (DABþ; DAKO), and counterstained with
modified Schmidt hematoxylin. Each antibody and its corre-
sponding fluorescent secondary antibody used were: ILK1 (rab-
bit polyclonal, Cell Signaling Technology #3862) detected by
Alexa594-conjugated
donkey
anti-rabbit
IgG
(Invitrogen,
#A21207); CD44 (mouse IgG2A, Abcam #ab6124) detected
by Alexa488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (HþL) (Invi-
trogen, #A21202). For DAB staining, collagen I (Abcam
ab138492) was used.
Whole slide digital images of each breast cancer sample were
captured with the Aperio Scanscope AT2 slide scanner (colla-
gen) and the Aperio Scanscope FL slide scanner (fluorescent
images) using a 20� objective. Using the digitized images, areas
of high and low collagen content were selected and circled. Cell
number in each area was determined by manually counting the
number of DAPI-positive nuclei. Similarly, double positive
cells (488 and 594) were identified and counted in each
selected area. Density of double positive cells was calculated
as the total number of positively stained cells per total number
of cells in each selected area.
Statistical analysis
Data represent mean � SEM of at least three independent
experiments conducted in triplicate. For CAM assays, data repre-
sent mean � SEM with n ¼ 5 chicken embryos per group. For
patient samples, statistical significance was tested with the Mann–
Whitney U test; for all others, statistical analysis was conducted
using a two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-test or
Student t test. P < 0.05 was considered to represent a significant
difference between conditions.
Results
Substratum stiffness and oxygen tension regulate the
expression of b1-integrin and ILK in invasive breast cancer cells
To investigate how ECM compliance affects breast cancer
cells, we used synthetic polyacrylamide substrata to mimic the
compliance of the microenvironment in the normal mammary
gland (Young modulus, E�130 Pa, "soft") and in breast
tumors (E�4020 Pa, "stiff"; ref. 4). On soft substrata, 4T1
mouse mammary carcinoma cells (Fig. 1A) and MDA-MB-231
human breast carcinoma cells (Supplementary Fig. S1) were
rounded in morphology. In contrast, both 4T1 and MDA-MB-
231 cells displayed an elongated morphology on stiff substra-
ta. Consistent with the expectation that the elongated cell
morphology on stiff substrata was associated with increased
interactions with the ECM, RT-PCR and immunoblotting
revealed increased expression of b1-integrin and ILK in the
cells cultured on stiff substrata at the transcript (Fig. 1B and C)
and protein (Fig. 1D) levels.
Hypoxia is prevalent in solid tumors and has been shown to
activate stem cell–like properties in several cancers, including
breast cancer (28). We found that hypoxia also led to an increase
in the transcript and protein levels of b1-integrin (Fig. 1B and D)
and ILK (Fig. 1C and D) in both 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1). A stiff, hypoxic microenvironment
induced the highest expression of these markers (Fig. 1B–D and
Supplementary Fig. S1). These results suggest that stiff and hyp-
oxic microenvironments potentiate signaling downstream of b1-
integrin and ILK in breast cancer cells.
The presence of breast CSCs correlates with metastasis and
relapse in breast cancer patients (29). To determine whether the
mechanical microenvironment and oxygen tension can regulate
breast CSC gene expression, we examined the relative effects of
substratum stiffness and hypoxia on the expression of the CSC
markers, CD44, Nanog, CD49f, and ALDH. We found that sub-
stratum stiffness and hypoxia led to synergistic increases in the
levels of each of these markers in both 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells
(Fig. 1E–H and Supplementary Fig. S1).
ILK has been found to regulate integrin function and cell
motility. We evaluated the effect of stiff substrata on cell
movement using time-lapse imaging, which revealed that
breast cancer cells cultured on stiff substrata were more motile
than those cultured on soft substrata (Fig. 1I). Together, these
data suggest that the increased stiffness and decreased oxygen
tension of the tumor microenvironment enhances integrin
signaling and activates CSC marker expression in invasive
breast cancer cells.
ILK and CD44 are elevated in potentially stiff regions
of human tumors
To evaluate the relationship between stiffness, ILK expres-
sion, and CSC marker induction in vivo, we examined the
expression of ILK and CD44 in human breast cancer samples.
We compared these to relative collagen content, which is
highly
correlated
with
stiffness
in
mammary
cancers
(30, 31). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that most
tumor cells expressed low levels of ILK and were CD44-negative

 in regions of the tumors that contained low levels of collagen
(collo), whereas ILK and CD44 double-positive tumor cells
were found in regions that contained high levels of collagen
(colhi) (Fig. 1J). In colhi regions, more than 25% of the
cells expressed both ILK and CD44. In contrast, only approx-
imately 4% of the cells expressed both markers in collo regions
(Fig. 1K). These data are consistent with the results of our cell
culture experiments, and suggest that breast CSCs are prefer-
entially located in stiff microenvironments.
Depleting ILK prevents CSC development in cells on stiff
substrata

 been implicated in human cancer (23, 24). Matrix stiffness has
been shown to increase integrin signaling and promote tumor
progression (9). To define the role of ILK in the CSC response to
stiffness and hypoxia, we used short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to
stably deplete ILK in 4T1 (4T1-shILK) (Fig. 2A) and MDA-MB-231
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). Depleting ILK led to a significant
change in the morphology of 4T1 cells cultured on stiff substra-
tum, as compared with scrambled controls (4T1-shctrl; Fig. 2B).
On stiff substrata, 4T1-shILK cells exhibited a rounded morphol-
ogy, similar to those on soft substrata, under both normoxia and
hypoxia. We also found that knockdown of ILK reduced the
expression of b1-integrin (Fig. 2C) and the CSC markers CD44
(Fig. 2D), Nanog (Fig. 2E), and CD49f (Fig. 2F) in 4T1 and MDA-
MB-231 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2) under both normoxia and
hypoxia. To examine the role of ILK in the regulation of the CSC
characteristics of anchorage-independent growth and self-renew-
al, we performed secondary mammosphere formation and soft
agar assays. We found that depleting ILK abrogated the ability of
both 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells to form secondary mammo-
spheres (Fig. 2G and Supplementary Fig. S2) and colonies in soft
agar (Fig. 2H; Supplementary Fig. S2). Together, these data suggest
that ILK is necessary for the induction of CSC marker expression
and behavior in breast cancer cells in response to matrix stiffness
and hypoxia.
ILK expression enhances breast CSC development
To determine whether ILK is sufficient to induce the develop-
ment of breast CSCs in the absence of a stiff microenvironment,
we expressed ILK ectopically using a bicistronic recombinant
adenovirus encoding for ILK and GFP (adILK). As a control, we
used adenovirus encoding for GFP alone (adGFP). Transduction
with adILK approximately doubled the levels of ILK transcript and
protein in 4T1 (Fig. 3A) and MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S3), and increased phosphorylation of Akt (pAkt; S437; Fig.
3B and Supplementary Fig. S3). qRT-PCR analysis revealed that
ectopic expression of ILK increased the transcript levels of b1-
integrin (Fig. 3C), CD44 (Fig. 3D), Nanog (Fig. 3E), and CD49f
(Fig. 3F) in 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3)
cultured on soft or stiff substrata under normoxia or hypoxia.
Ectopic expression of ILK also enhanced the formation of sec-
ondary mammospheres (Fig. 3G and Supplementary Fig. S3) and
colonies in soft agar (Fig. 3H and Supplementary Fig. S3), dem-
onstrating that increased expression of ILK can further activate
CSC gene expression and behavior even when cells are cultured on
stiff substrata under hypoxic conditions.
ILK signals through PI3K/Akt to regulate CSC development
Previous work has suggested that ILK regulates cell survival
through the PI3K/Akt pathway (32), which has also been impli-
cated in cancer cell (33, 34) and CSC survival (35, 36), cancer cell
proliferation (37, 38), and the CSC phenotype (39). We found
that knockdown of ILK reduced the phosphorylation of Akt (Fig.
4A and Supplementary Fig. S4). Disrupting signaling through
PI3K by treating cells with the selective inhibitor, LY294002 (Fig.
4B and Supplementary Fig. S4), also decreased the transcript levels
of b1-integrin (Fig.4C) and ILK (Fig.4D) in 4T1 and MDA-MB-231
cells (Supplementary Fig. S4) cultured on soft or stiff substrata
under normoxia or hypoxia. Consistent with the concept that Akt
activation is necessary for the ILK-dependent induction of CSCs in
response to hypoxia or a stiff microenvironment, the levels of
CD44 (Fig. 4E), Nanog (Fig. 4F), and CD49f (Fig. 4G) decreased
significantly in response to treatment with LY294002 in 4T1 and
MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4) under all conditions.
Similarly, treatment with LY294002 reduced the formation of
both secondary mammospheres (Fig. 4H) and colonies in soft
agar (Fig. 4I). These data suggest that a stiff, hypoxic microenvi-
ronment regulates development of CSCs in part by activating
signaling through ILK and PI3K.
Stiff substratum promotes angiogenesis and dissemination of
tumor cells through ILK
To test directly whether stiff substratum promotes tumorigen-
esis and tumor cell dissemination, we embedded 4T1 cells in
collagen gels of low (collo, 3 mg/mL), medium (colmed, 4.5 mg/
mL), or high (colhi, 6 mg/mL) stiffness (Fig. 5A) and then grafted
them onto the CAMs of chicken embryos (40). We found that all
colhi-grafted CAMs formed primary tumors at the graft sites,
whereas none of the collo- and only 4 of 6 of the colmed-grafted
CAMs developed primary tumors (Fig. 5B). The tumors that
formed in high collagen developed multiple micrometastases
near blood vessels adjacent to the graft sites (Fig. 5C). To define
the effects of ILK on tumor formation, we performed CAM assays
using 4T1-shctrl or 4T1-shILK cells embedded in high collagen
gels. Both 4T1-shctrl and 4T1-shILK cells formed primary tumors
on the CAM (Fig. 5D). However, the 4T1-shILK primary tumors
were half the size of the 4T1-shctrl tumors (Fig. 5D). To examine
how ILK affects metastatic potential, we performed qRT-PCR
analysis for GFP in the lungs of the chicken embryos after 5 days
of incubation with GFP-labeled 4T1 cells. We found significantly
lower levels of GFP in the lungs of embryos with 4T1-shILK-
grafted CAMs than in those with 4T1-shctrl–grafted CAMs (Fig.
5E). These data suggest that matrix stiffness and ILK affect tumor
formation as well as tumor cell dissemination.
Angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer that is critical for tumor
growth and metastasis (41). To investigate how substratum
stiffness affects hypoxia-dependent angiogenesis, we examined
the expression of VEGF-A in 4T1 cells cultured on soft or stiff
substrata under normoxia or hypoxia. We found that culture on
stiff substratum upregulated the expression of VEGF-A (Fig. 5F),
suggesting that the mechanical properties of the microenviron-
ment can regulate angiogenic signaling. As expected, hypoxia
further increased the levels of VEGF-A in cells cultured on both
soft and stiff substrata (Fig. 5F). Depleting ILK significantly
reduced VEGF-A expression in 4T1 cells cultured on soft or stiff
substrata under normoxia or hypoxia (Fig. 5G). Quantitative
image analysis revealed that the blood vessel density in the CAM
adjacent to 4T1-shILK tumors was significantly lower than
that adjacent to 4T1-shctrl tumors (Fig. 5H). These data suggest
that loss of ILK impairs the angiogenic potential of breast cancer
cells. Consistently, we found that inhibiting PI3K with LY294002
significantly reduced the levels of VEGF-A (Fig. 5I), whereas
ectopic expression of ILK increased the levels of VEGF-A
(Fig. 5J) under all culture conditions. These data suggest that ILK
signals through the PI3K pathway to regulate VEGF-A expression
in response to matrix stiffness and hypoxia.
Discussion
It is well appreciated that the distinct physical properties of
the tumor microenvironment can affect cancer cell fate. Tumor
stiffness induces integrin clustering and downstream signaling
that control cancer cell proliferation, gene expression, and

 invasiveness (8, 42, 43). Separately, hypoxia promotes CSC
properties, in part through activation of hypoxia-inducible
factors (HIFs) that regulate the expression of stem cell markers
(16, 44). Here, we found that these two features of the tumor
microenvironment, hypoxia and substratum stiffness, work
synergistically through ILK to enhance breast CSC gene expres-
sion, tumor growth, and metastasis. Future work using limiting
dilution assays in vivo with cells primed by hypoxia, stiff
substrata, and/or ILK might clarify which subpopulation has
the
highest
tumor-initiating
potential,
but
experimental
approaches that maintain the microenvironmental conditions
of the injected cells need to be developed. Nonetheless, our
findings are congruent with clinical data showing that hypoxia
and stiffness correlate with a poor prognosis in breast cancer
(45, 46).
Also known as tumor-repopulating cells or tumor-initiating
cells, CSCs represent a self-renewing subpopulation of cancer cells
that promote tumor progression of many solid cancers, including
those of the breast, colon, and brain (47). While our data suggest
that stiff and hypoxic microenvironments promote the develop-
ment of CSCs from breast cancer cells, this relationship is prob-
ably not generalizable to all tumor types and stages. Indeed,
melanoma tumor-repopulating cells preferentially self-renew on
soft substrata in a Sox2-dependent manner (48). In contrast,
glioblastoma tumor-initiating cells are insensitive to matrix
mechanics, and enhancing their cytoskeletal contractility causes
a loss of their tumor-promoting properties (49). In the breast,
mechanosensing and mechanotransduction are altered as a func-
tion of aging (50), so the effects of stiffness on CSCs likely also
depends on age.

 Matrix stiffness clearly activates signaling through b1-integrin,
which transmits information about the mechanical properties of
the microenvironment through the ILK/PI3K/Akt pathway and
eventually to CSC-related genes, including the CSC markers
examined here – CD44, Nanog, CD49f, and ALDH. ILK is well
appreciated for its roles in stemness and metastasis (33, 34, 37)
and is known to stimulate tumor angiogenesis through VEGF-A
(51). Our data suggest a positive feedback loop in which the
signaling activated by ILK induces increased expression of
mechanosensors, including b1-integrin and ILK itself. Hypoxia
enhances activation of this mechanotransduction pathway, and
while the exact mechanism by which this occurs is not clear,
hypoxia has been found to upregulate the expression of ILK in
prostate cancer (52) and colorectal cancer cells (53) in a HIF1a-
dependent manner (54). Recent studies indicate that HIF1a can
drive breast cancer metastasis through ECM stiffening and colla-
gen fiber alignment (55). It is possible that hypoxia promotes
ECM remodeling and, concomitantly, elevates the levels of ILK to
prime breast cancer cells to be more sensitive to mechanically stiff
microenvironments. Our results clearly indicate that loss of ILK
abrogates the mechanosensing capability of tumor cells, prevents
the development of CSCs, and blocks tumor growth and dissem-
ination. These data suggest that ILK acts as a critical mechan-
osensor that signals through the PI3K/Akt pathway to mediate the
formation of breast CSCs under stiff and hypoxic conditions. The
stiff, hypoxic regions of a tumor might, therefore, be responsible
for inducing both CSC gene expression and behavior in tumor
cells residing within, as well as angiogenesis to facilitate tumor cell
dissemination. Therapies targeted at microenvironment-induced
signaling would need to address both physical properties to
disrupt the formation and metastatic spread of breast CSCs.
