BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
The diterpenoids carnosol (CS) and carnosic acid (CA) from Salvia spp. exert prominent anti-inflammatory activities but their
molecular mechanisms remained unclear. Here we investigated the effectiveness of CS and CA in inflammatory pain and the
cellular interference with their putative molecular targets.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
The effects of CS and CA in different models of inflammatory pain were investigated. The inhibition of key enzymes in eicosanoid
biosynthesis, namely microsomal prostaglandin E2 synthase-1 (mPGES-1) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) was confirmed by CS and
CA, and we determined the consequence on the eicosanoid network in activated human primary monocytes and neutrophils.
Molecular interactions and binding modes of CS and CA to target enzymes were analyzed by docking studies.
KEY RESULTS
CS and CA displayed significant and dose-dependent anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects in carrageenan-induced
mouse hyperalgesia 4 h post injection of the stimuli, and also inhibited the analgesic response in the late phase of the formalin
test. Moreover, both compounds potently inhibited cell-free mPGES-1 and 5-LO activity and preferentially suppressed the for-
mation of mPGES-1 and 5-LO-derived products in cellular studies. Our in silico analysis for mPGES-1 and 5-LO supports that CS
and CA are dual 5-LO/mPGES-1 inhibitors.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS
In summary, we propose that the combined inhibition of mPGES-1 and 5-LO by CS and CA essentially contributes to the bioac-
tivity of these diterpenoids. Our findings pave the way for a rational use of Salvia spp., traditionally used as anti-inflammatory
remedy, in the continuous expanding context of nutraceuticals.

Introduction
Diterpenoids are secondary metabolites found in higher
plants, fungi, and marine organisms, and they are known to
display multiple biological activities (Giamperi et al., 2012;
Zhao et al., 2014). The anti-inflammatory and analgesic
characteristics
of
some
diterpenoids
-
especially
those
isolated from plants - have been intensively described, and
mainly interfere with the multiple signaling pathways that
are deregulated during inflammation and inflammatory
pain syndrome, including NF-κB (Salminen et al., 2008),
p38-MAPK (Kundu et al., 2006) and phosphatidylinositol-3K
(Johnson, 2011).
Among the analgesic diterpenoids, much attention has
recently been pointed on carnosol (CS) and carnosic acid (CA;
Figure
1),
which
suppress
cyclooxygenase
(COX)-2,
interleukin-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α expression as well
as leukocyte infiltration in inflamed tissues (Mengoni et al.,
2011; Zhao et al., 2015) and regulate the levels of the
inflammatory
MMP-9
and
monocyte
chemoattractant
protein-1 (MCP-1) in cell migration (Chae et al., 2012). In
addition, molecular targets of CS and CA within the eicosa-
noid biosynthetic pathways have been revealed, including
5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), the key enzyme in the biosynthesis
of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes (Laughton et al., 1991;
Poeckel et al., 2008), COX enzymes that initiate prostaglan-
din (PG) synthesis (Laughton et al., 1991), and microsomal
PGE2 synthase (mPGES)-1 (Bauer et al., 2012) which is the
terminal enzyme in pro-inflammatory PGE2 formation.
Contingently, it has been found that Salvia species (spp.)
(Labiateae) containing these diterpenoids (Bruna et al., 2006;
Villa et al., 2009), could act as a mild analgesic (Mirjalili et al.,
2006; Raal et al., 2007). Recent investigations have demon-
strated the anti-nociceptive potential of Salvia officinalis ex-
tract and its isolated compound CS in different in vivo models
of inflammation (Rodrigues et al., 2012). Subsequently, it has
been validated that the hydroalcoholic extract of Salvia
officinalis and its constituent CS inhibit formalin-induced
pain and inflammation in mice (Emami et al., 2013).
Furthemore, increasing interest worldwide has been
expressed within recent years in the use of bioactive com-
pounds originally present in plants to provide health-care
products (Miyata, 2007; Di Lorenzo et al., 2013). In this
context, different plants belonging to Salvia spp. offer consid-
erable potential for the development of healthier foods.
Overall, most of their bioactive components, in addition to
other important nutritional components such as vitamins
and minerals, exhibit anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative
properties that could provide a rational for the prevention
and/or treatment of inflammatory complications (Maione
et al., 2015b).
In light of the ethnobotanical use of Salvia spp. (and their
potential application as nutraceuticals) wherein the main
constituents
are
diterpenoids,
here
we
have
evaluated
potential analgesic activities of the CS and CA in the treat-
ment of pain and inflammation. In more detail, we have used
in vivo models of inflammatory and mechanical pain, and
successively we have investigated the cellular interference
with their molecular targets taking into account the key en-
zymes involved in the arachidonic acid cascade as mPGES-1
and 5-LO.

controlled temperature, humidity and light/dark cycle, and
with food and water ad libitum. A total of 66 animals were

 Induction and assessment of carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia.
Acute
inflammation was induced in the right hind paw by injecting
subcutaneously (s.c.) 50 μl of freshly prepared solution of 1%
carrageenan. The left paw received 50 μl of saline, which
served as control. The response to inflammatory pain was
determined by measuring the mechanical nociceptive pressure
by
the
paw
pressure
test
via
a
commercially
available
analgesiometer (Ugo Basile, Italy). The apparatus was set up to
apply a force of 0-250 g, increasing from zero. The nociceptive
threshold was taken as the end point at which mice vocalized
or struggled vigorously (Randall and Selitto, 1957). CS and CA
were administrated subcutaneously (s.c.) into the dorsal hind
paw of the mice in a dose-dependent manner (1-100 μg 20 μl�1)
30 min before 1% carrageenan (50 μl; s.c.) into the dorsal hind
paw of the mice, and the pressure threshold was observed at
0.5, 1, 3, and 4 h. The time selection was made based on the
preliminary studies. A change in the hyperalgesic state was
calculated as a percentage of the maximum possible effect
(% MPE) from the formula: [(P2-P1)/(P0-P1) × 100], where P1
and P2 were the pre- and post-drug paw withdrawal thresholds
respectively, and P0 was the cut-off (250 g).
Formalin test.
The procedure used has been previously
described (Colucci et al., 2008). Subcutaneous injection of a
dilute solution of formalin (1%, 20 μl/paw) into the mice
hind paw evokes nociceptive behavioral responses, such as
licking,
biting
the
injected
paw
or
both,
which
are
considered indices for pain. The nociceptive response shows
a biphasic trend, consisting of an early phase occurring
from 0 to 10 min after the formalin injection, due to the
direct stimulation of peripheral nociceptors, followed by a
late prolonged phase occurring from 20 to 40 min that
reflects the response to inflammatory pain. In light of the
results
for
carrageenan-induced
hyperalgesia,
we
have
selected the dose of 100 μg to test the effect of the two
diterpenoids on the formalin test. During the test, the
mouse was placed in a Plexiglas observation cage (30 × 14 ×
12 cm), 1 h before the formalin administration to allow it to
acclimatize to its surroundings. The total time (s) that the
animal spent licking or biting its paw during the formalin-
induced early and late phase of nociception was recorded.
CS and CA were administrated subcutaneously (s.c.) (100
μg/20 μl) 30 min before formalin injection (20 μl; s.c.).
Activity

for
human
recombinant
5-LO.
Human
recombinant 5-LO was expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli
BL21
(DE3))
cells
and
partially
purified
by
affinity
chromatography using an ATP-agarose column as described
(Koeberle et al., (2014). Semi-purified 5-LO (1.6 ± 0.2 μg 5-
LO products per μg protein) was diluted in PBS containing
EDTA (1 mM) and ATP (1 mM) to a concentration of
0.5 μg mL�1 and immediately pre-incubated with the test
compounds (1 μl in DMSO; final DMSO concentration:
0.1%) for 10 min at 4°C. Samples were pre-warmed for 30 s
at 37°C, and 5-LO product formation was initiated by
addition of CaCl2 (5 μl; in water) and arachidonic acid (5 μl;
in methanol) to final concentrations of 2 mM and 20 μM,
respectively. The reaction was stopped after 10 min at 37°C by
addition of 1 ml ice-cold methanol. Formed 5-LO metabolites
(all-trans isomers of LTB4 and 5-hydro(pero)xy-6,8,11,14-
eicosatetraenoic acid (5-H(P)ETE)) were extracted and an
aliquot of 50 μl analyzed by reversed phase-HPLC (RP-
HPLC) as described (Koeberle et al., 2009). Data were
normalized
to the vehicle control to avoid
variations
independent of test compounds.

Microsomal preparations
of
interleukin-1β-treated
A549
(Homo
sapiens
lung
carcinoma) cells were prepared as previously described
(Koeberle et al., 2008) and used as source for mPGES-1
(Koeberle et al., 2008). Microsomes (2.5–5 μg total protein)
in 50 μl potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4)
containing 2.5 mM glutathione were pre-incubated with the
test compounds (1 μl in DMSO; final DMSO concentration:
2%) for 15 min at 4°C. The reaction was started by addition
of PGH2 (50 μl in potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH
7.4) containing 2.5 mM glutathione; final concentration:
20 μM) and terminated after 1 min by addition of stop
solution (100 μl; 40 mM FeCl2, 80 mM citric acid and 10 μM
of 11β-PGE2 as internal standard). PGE2 was extracted and
analyzed by reversed phase-HPLC as described (Koeberle
et al., 2008). Data were normalized to the vehicle control to
avoid variations independent of test compounds.
Blood cell isolation and cultivation of cell lines.
Human
neutrophils

and centrifugation on Histopaque-1077 cushions (Sigma-
Aldrich (Deisenhofen, Germany). Erythrocytes were lysed
under hypotonic conditions and neutrophils were recovered
by centrifugation. Monocytes were isolated from the fraction
of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by adherence
to culture flasks. Washed cells were finally resuspended in
PBS pH 7.4 plus 1 mM CaCl2 containing 1 mg/ml glucose
(neutrophils) or monocyte medium (RPMI 1640 medium

as
previously

(Koeberle

The
chromatography system was coupled to a Quadrupole Ion
Trap (QTRAP) 5500 Mass Spectrometer (AB Sciex, Darmstadt,
Germany) equipped with an electrospray ionization source.
Eicosanoids were quantified by multiple reaction monitoring
in the negative using a previously reported method with a
lower limit of detection of 150 to 600 pg ml�1 and linear
quantification range up to 200 ng ml�1 (Koeberle et al.,
2014). Automatic peak integration was performed with
ANALYST 1.6 software (Sciex, Darmstadt, Germany) using
IntelliQuan default settings. Data were normalized on the
internal standard PGB1 and are given as relative intensities.
Docking studies.
The chemical structures of CS and CA were
built with MAESTRO BUILD PANEL (version 9.6) (Maestro, 2013)
and processed with LIGPREP (version 2.8) (LigPrep, 2013),
generating all the possible tautomers, protonation states at a
pH of 7.4 ± 1.0, and finally minimized using optimized
potentials for liquid simulations (OPLS, 2005) force field.
The three-dimensional structures of the protein targets
mPGES-1 (Li et al., 2014) and 5-LO (Gilbert et al., 2011)
(PDB code: 4BPM and 3O8Y respectively) were prepared
with the Schrödinger Protein Preparation Wizard (Maestro,
2013). The water molecules were removed, all hydrogens
were added and bond orders were assigned. Molecular
docking studies of these two compounds, with mPGES-1 as
target, were performed using standard precision (SP) and

We
chose

Following the same procedure for 5-LO, extra-precision
output results were analyzed, and best-scoring poses were
used as input to perform an induced-fit docking for 5-LO
(Sherman et al., 2006a; Sherman et al., 2006b; Induced,
2013), choosing PHE177, TYR181, HIS367, LEU368, HIS372,

residues as flexible and the rest of the protein as rigid. We
set a grid inner box size of 10 Å and grid outer box of 20 Å, sav-
ing 30 conformations as maximum number of binding
modes. Illustrations of the 2D and 3D models were generated
using Maestro (version 9.6) (Maestro, 2013).
Statistical analysis
The results obtained were expressed as the mean ± SEM. Sta-
tistical analysis was performed by using one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett’s or Tukey’s post hoc
test. In some cases, one sample t-test was used to evaluate sig-
nificance against the hypothetical zero value. Statistical anal-
ysis was performed by using GRAPHPAD PRISM 4.0 software (San
Diego, CA, USA). Data were considered statistically signifi-
cant when a value of P < 0.05 was achieved. The data and sta-
tistical analysis comply with the recommendations on
experimental design and analysis in pharmacology (Curtis
et al., 2015).
Materials
CS and CA were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Deisenhofen,
Germany). Test compounds were dissolved in DMSO, stored
in the dark at �20°C, and freezing/thawing cycles were kept
to a minimum. Carrageenan was obtained from Sigma-
Aldrich Co. (Milan, Italy). Unless otherwise stated, all the
other reagents were from Carlo Erba Reagents (Milan, Italy).
Results
Effect of CS and CA on carrageenan-induced
hyperalgesia in mice
We determined the analgesic efficacy of CS and CA in
carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia, a well-established murine
pain model (Morris, 2003). As shown in Figure 2, both CS and
CA displayed significant anti-nociceptive effects 4 h after

30 min before injection of 1% carrageenan (50 μL; s.c.) into the same
hind paw of mice. Paw withdrawal was recorded 4 h after carra-
geenan administration. The results obtained are expressed as the

(100
μg/paw).
The
anti-hyperalgesic
effect
of
CS
was
protracted even at a dose of 30 μg/paw (43.00±5.13 vs 66.33
±5.89; P<0.01). No significant effects were observed for the
diterpenoids at a dose of 1 μg/paw (Figure 2).
Effect of CS and CA on formalin-induced pain
in mice
As shown in Figure 3, the s.c. administration of CS and CA in-
creased the nociceptive threshold in the formalin-induced
pain model in mice. Note that CS and CA significantly
inhibited the pain response in the paw only in the late phase
(302.6±39.50 vs 96.66±24.55; P<0.001 and 296.66±51.75 vs
112.00±23.25; P<0.001 for CS and CA respectively), when ad-
ministered at the high dose (100 μg/paw).
Effect of CS and CA on the eicosanoid profile of
activated human neutrophils and monocytes
To shed light on the molecular mechanisms for the analgesic
action of CS and CA in inflammatory pain, we investigated
their effects on the pro-inflammatory eicosanoid network.
First, we confirmed that CS and CA potently inhibit 5-LO
(CS: IC50 = 0.3; CA: IC50 = 0.8 μM; Figure 4A) and mPGES-1
(CS: IC50 = 10.9; CA: IC50 = 14.0 μM; Figure 4B), two key
enzymes involved in inflammatory pain, in cell-free assays, as
previously described (Poeckel et al., 2008; Bauer et al., 2012).
Then, we analyzed the eicosanoid profile of activated im-
mune cells using ultraperfomance liquid chromatography-
coupled with electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spec-
trometry (UPLC-MS/MS) analysis. Human freshly isolated neu-
trophils were pre-treated with CS and CA (3 to 30 μM), and
then stimulated with Ca2+-ionophore A23187 to induce eicosa-
noid formation. As expected, both CS and CA efficiently
suppressed the generation of 5-LO products derived from ara-
chidonic acid (LTB4, LTB4 isomers, 5-hydroxyicosatetraenoic
acid (5-HETE), 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE), 5,12-di-
hydroxy-6,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic

eicosatrienoic
acid
(5-hydroxy-
eicosatrienoic acid (5-HETrE)) and eicosapentaenoic acid (5-

these assays, CS was more potent than CA, except for inhibition
of LTB4 and 5-HEPE formation (Figure 5A and Supporting Infor-
mation Figure S1A). To access the effect of CS and CA on the
prostanoid profile, we induced the expression of COX-2 and
mPGES-1 and concomitant formation of prostanoids in human
blood monocytes by LPS. CS and CA (3 to 30 μM) inhibited
the
formation
of

in the potency between CS and CA were not observed, except
for TxB1, whose formation was more potently inhibited by
CS compared to CA (Figure 5B and Supporting Information

Besides 5-LO product formation, CS and CA also sup-
pressed the formation of distinct lipid mediators derived
from 15-LO and 12-LO in activated immune cells (Figure 5

was less potently suppressed (Figure 5A). In contrast, CA did
not dissect between inhibition of 5-LO and 12/15-LO
products
in
neutrophils.
In
LPS-activated
monocytes,
both CS and CA rather induced 12-HETE and 12-HEPE forma-
tion, while 15-HETE was equipotently inhibited compared to
5-LO product formation, and 15-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid
(15-HETrE) formation was less potently suppressed (Figure 5B).
Taken together, our results indicate that 5-LO and mPGES-1
are primary targets of CS and CA which shape the eicosanoid
profile of activated innate immune cells.
Molecular docking studies of CS and CA
Our in silico studies are focused on mPGES-1 and 5-LO. Func-
tionally, mPGES-1 is mainly associated to COX-2 and the in-
duction
of
these
two
enzymes
by
pro-inflammatory
cytokines leads to an outpouring of PGE2 production by in-
flammatory cells.
Interaction of CS and CA on mPGES-1 binding
sites
In order to propose a binding mode of CS and CA with the
catalytic domain of mPGES-1, we used herein for docking
calculations
the
crystal
structures
of
mPGES-1
in
complex with GSH and the inhibitor 2-[[2,6-bis(chloranyl)-
3-[(2,2-dimethylpropanoylamino)methyl]phenyl]amino]- 1-
methyl-6-(2-methyl-2-oxidanyl-propoxy)- N-[2,2,2-tris(fluo-
ranyl)ethyl]benzimidazole- 5-carboxamide, (shown as com-
pound 3 in Figure 1); (Li et al., 2014) (PDB code: 4BPM). For
our analysis, we referred to the binding mode of 3 which in-
teracts with three equivalent active site cavities located at
the membrane-spanning region of each monomer interface.
In more detail, we analyzed the three-dimensional model
(Figure 6) and observed an extended set of polar and

 hydrophobic interactions of 3 with the key residues responsi-
ble for the catalytic activity of the investigated protein
(A:ARG126, A:SER127, and A:THR131). In particular, 3 adopts
a peculiar shape in the binding site, and this is mainly due
to
a
strong
edge-to-face
π�π
interaction
between
its
dichlorophenyl moiety and the phenyl group in the side
chain of C:PHE44 and with C:HIS53 (Figure 6). The first step
of our study is represented from the validation of the model,
which was performed by molecular docking (Glide Software)
(Friesner et al., 2004; Halgren et al., 2004; Friesner et al.,
2006) of 3 with mPGES-1 catalytic domain. As shown in
Figure 6, our calculated model well reproduces the crystal
binding mode of 3, where the majority of interactions are
respected. After this step of validation, we performed molecu-
lar docking study of CS and CA with the enzyme.
CS and CA are accommodated in the same pocket of 3
(Figure 7), establishing good interactions with receptor coun-
terpart (Sjogren et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014; Luz et al., 2015). CS
establishes fundamental hydrophobic, electrostatic and π-π
interactions namely with ARG38, PHE44, ARG52, HIS53 of
chain C, and ARG126, PRO124, SER127, THR131 of chain A
(Figure 7C), in analogy to the co-crystallized ligand. More-
over, it makes interactions with GLY35, LEU39, ASP49 of
the chain C, and ALA123 of the chain A (Figures 7A and C).
On the other hand, CA shows the same pattern of key hydro-
phobic and π-π interactions (see above), and hydrogen bond
between the carboxyl group and ARG52 (Figures 7B and D).
Interaction of CS and CA on 5-LO binding sites
Regarding the 5-LO enzyme, the induced fit docking ap-
proach was used to simulate and study the interactions of
CS and CA with the residues that belong to the active site
close to the catalytic iron of this enzyme (Gilbert et al.,
2011). The analysis of the most representative docking poses
of CS in the ligand binding site reveals a better accommoda-
tion with respect to CA as it establishes key interactions with

Discussion
Pain is “an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience as-
sociated with actual or potential tissue damage” (Loeser and
Treede, 2008). Despite the rapid progresses in the develop-
ment of several treatments of inflammatory pain, the efficacy
and
tolerability
of
conventional
analgesics
can
be
overshadowed by their unwanted side effects. The research
on natural products, founded on their ethnopharmacological
information, has provided significant contributions to drug
improvement by the discovery of novel chemical structures
and/or mechanism of actions in this respect (Rates, 2001;
Maione et al., 2009; Maione et al., 2013; Maione et al., 2014;
Zhao et al., 2014; Maione et al., 2015a).
Along these lines, anti-inflammatory and analgesic char-
acteristics of some members of the diterpenoid family have
been described that may essentially interfere with the
multiple signaling pathways that are deregulated during
inflammation and inflammatory pain syndromes. Among
these
diterpenoids,
much
attention
has
been
recently
pointed on CS and CA that have been identified in leave ex-
tracts of different Salvia spp. (Senorans et al., 2000; Ramirez
et al., 2006; Amici et al., 2014). We started our study by
assessing the effect of CS and CA on the modulation of

 peripheral inflammatory pain in a model of carrageenan-
induced hyperalgesia in mice. This test is commonly used
as an experimental animal model of acute inflammation, es-
sentially regulated by mediators such as histamine, seroto-
nin, bradykinin (in the first 2 h), and successively by
prostaglandins (starting at 3 to 4 h) mainly released from
neutrophils and macrophages (Morris, 2003; Rauf et al.,
2015).
All
these
mediators
detected
at
sites
of
inflammation orchestrate the inflammatory response by
acting as vasodilators and hyperalgesic agents, and they
simultaneously induce vascular permeability changes, ery-
thema and oedema (Rackham and Ford-Hutchinson, 1983).
Moreover, their presence in the spinal cord and primary
afferent neurons in pathological pain conditions has also
been demonstrated (Noguchi and Okubo, 2011). Impor-
tantly,
the
results
from
the
carrageenan-induced
paw
hyperalgesia study demonstrate an anti-hyperalgesic effect
of both diterpenoids at 4 h, which is likely attributed to
the inhibition of eicosanoid production.
In order to confirm the analgesic properties of CS and CA,
the formalin-induced pain test was employed. Formalin
injection into the paw elicits a distinct biphasic nociceptive
response. Centrally acting drugs such as opioids inhibit both
early and late phases almost equally (Shibata et al., 1989)
whereas nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and
corticosteroids, which are primarily acting inthe periphery, only
inhibit the late phase. The inhibitory effect of the diterpenoids
in the second phase suggests a potential anti-inflammatory
action (Muhammad et al., 2015). Thus, the two diterpenoids
primarily relieve the second phase (inflammatory pain), which
suggests an interference with eicosanoid biosynthesis.
CS and CA have been reported to interfere with key signal
transduction pathways of inflammation and cancer but only
few direct molecular targets have been identified besides 5-LO
and mPGES-1. For example, CS inhibits the activation of nu-
clear factor κB (IC50 = 2.5-10 μM; (Lo et al., 2002)), p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase (at 20 μM; (Lo et al.,
2002)), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (at 20 μM; (Lo
et al., 2002)), β-catenin (at 25 μM; (Moran et al., 2005)), and
intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (IC50 ≈ 30 μM; (Poeckel et al.,
2008)) and activates Nrf2 (EC50 = 1-10 μM; (Martin et al.,
2004)), phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt (at 10 μM; (Martin
et
al., 2004)), protein kinase C
signaling (at
60
μM;
(Subbaramaiah et al., 2002)) and peroxisome proliferator-
activated receptor γ (EC50 ≈ 40 μM; (Rau et al., 2006)). Addi-
tionally, our in vitro results support the hypothesis that CS
and CA could actually act by a mechanism related to the inhi-
bition of PGE2 biosynthesis in accordance with inhibition of
COX-2 and leukocyte infiltration in inflamed tissues (Shibata
et al., 1989; Mengoni et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2015). In fact,
our present findings and previous data reveal that CS and
CA interfere with key enzymes in eicosanoid formation, in
particular with 5-LO (Laughton et al., 1991; Poeckel et al.,
2008), less prominent with mPGES-1 (Bauer et al., 2012) and
to minor degree with COX enzymes (Laughton et al., 1991).
The superior potency of CS compared to CA seems to depend
on differences in the 5-LO binding affinity rather than in
compound stability because CS is considered more stable
than CA (Zhang et al., 2012). The impact of cellular metabo-
lism on the concentration of CS and CA remains unclear.
On this basis, we investigated how the multi-target drugs CS
and CA modulate the eicosanoid profile of activated human
neutrophils and monocytes. Both compounds suppressed
the formation of a wide range of 5-LO- and COX-derived lipid
mediators. Excessive redirections as previously described for
COX and mPGES-1 inhibitors were not observed within the
eicosanoid network (Koeberle and Werz, 2015). The superior
selectivity for 5-LO and mPGES-1 compared to COX, 12-
and 15-LO rather precludes general effects of CS and CA on
substrate supply or upstream signaling pathways such as
LPS signal transduction. So far, our results strongly suggest
that 5-LO and mPGES-1 and potentially 12- and 15-LO repre-
sent relevant targets of CS and CA with impact on the eicosa-
noid network of primary innate immune cells. Moreover, in
intact cells, the two diterpenoids seem to interfere to a con-
siderable extent with COX activity, despite their failure to
suppress isolated bovine COX-1 and human recombinant
COX-2 in cell-free assays (Bauer et al., 2012), either by direct
enzyme inhibition in the cellular context or by diminished
enzyme expression. In fact, both CS and CA have been re-
ported to inhibit the activation of NF-κB (Lo et al., 2002),
(Yu et al., 2008), a critical transcription factor regulating the
expression of inducible COX-2 and mPGES-1. Of interest,
5-, 12- and/or 15-LO activities are required for the biosynthe-
sis of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators including
resolvins, protectins and maresins (SPMs) (Serhan, 2014).
The effect of CS and CA on the generation of SPMs remains
elusive in light of the complex and partly opposing effects
of CS and CA on the formation of 12- and 15-LO products de-
pending on lipid species, cell type and experimental condi-
tion. However, it is likely that also SPM biosynthesis is
profoundly regulated by CS and CA with potential conse-
quence for the resolution of inflammation. By molecular
docking, we have characterized the interaction of CS and
CA with mPGES-1 and 5-LO (Poeckel et al., 2008; Emami
et al., 2013). Dual inhibitors that block both mPGES-1 and
5-LOX within arachidonic acid metabolic pathways are ex-
pected to possess clinical advantages over selective inhibitors
of COX enzymes (Thoren et al., 2003; Samuelsson et al., 2007;
Koeberle and Werz, 2014; Koeberle and Werz, 2015). For
these reasons, the detailed analysis of the eicosanoid network
together with contextual docking analysis on mPGES-1 and
5-LOX has represented a crucial step in the structural part of
our study. Relating to mPGES-1, we have analyzed the bind-
ing of CS and CA in the mPGES-1 binding site in presence
of the cofactor glutathione (GSH) (Sjogren et al., 2013; Li
et al., 2014; Luz et al., 2015). An accurate analysis of the main
interactions of compounds in the active site allows the ratio-
nalization of their activity (Sjogren et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014;
Chini et al., 2015; Iranshahi et al., 2015; Luz et al., 2015;
Terracciano et al., 2015). In particular, CS and CA are accom-
modated in the pocket situated in the region at the interface
of the two mPGES-1 subunits, establishing good interactions
with the receptor counterpart. All the established interac-
tions corroborate the comparable antagonist activity of both
diterpenoids, in agreement with the experimental biological
inhibition reported by Bauer et al. (2012), and their response
to inflammatory pain reported above. Regarding 5-LO, the in-
duced fit docking approach was used to simulate and to study
the interactions between 5-LO and CS or CA with residues be-
longing to the active site close to the catalytic iron (Gilbert
et al., 2011). These molecular results seem to be in accordance

 with the observed activity of the two diterpenoids on human
recombinant enzyme and in activated human primary
neutrophils.
Conclusions
In vivo evidences, molecular docking studies and eicosanoid
profiling provide a mechanistic basis for the anti-nociceptive ef-
fects of CS and CA associated with inflammatory pain. Our bio-
logical evaluation as well as the in silico data clearly show that CS
and CA act on mPGES- 1 and 5-LO leading to suppression of
pro-inflammatory eicosanoid formation. These conclusions ren-
der CS and CA interesting bioactive ingredients in Salvia spp.
that are traditionally used as anti-inflammatory remedies and
paving the way for a rational use of Salvia spp. nutraceuticals.
