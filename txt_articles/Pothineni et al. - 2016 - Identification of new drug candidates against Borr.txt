Abstract: Lyme disease is the most common zoonotic bacterial disease in North America. 
It is estimated that .300,000 cases per annum are reported in USA alone. A total of 10%–20% 
of patients who have been treated with antibiotic therapy report the recrudescence of symp-
toms, such as muscle and joint pain, psychosocial and cognitive difficulties, and generalized 
fatigue. This condition is referred to as posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome. While there is 
no evidence for the presence of viable infectious organisms in individuals with posttreatment 
Lyme disease syndrome, some researchers found surviving Borrelia burgdorferi population 
in rodents and primates even after antibiotic treatment. Although such observations need more 
ratification, there is unmet need for developing the therapeutic agents that focus on removing the 
persisting bacterial form of B. burgdorferi in rodent and nonhuman primates. For this purpose, 
high-throughput screening was done using BacTiter-Glo assay for four compound libraries to 
identify candidates that stop the growth of B. burgdorferi in vitro. The four chemical libraries 
containing 4,366 compounds (80% Food and Drug Administration [FDA] approved) that were 
screened are Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds (LOPAC1280), the National 
Institutes of Health Clinical Collection, the Microsource Spectrum, and the Biomol FDA. We 
subsequently identified 150 unique compounds, which inhibited .90% of B.  
burgdorferi growth 
at a concentration of ,25 µM. These 150 unique compounds comprise many safe antibiotics, 
chemical compounds, and also small molecules from plant sources. Of the 150 unique com-
pounds, 101 compounds are FDA approved. We selected the top 20 FDA-approved molecules 
based on safety and potency and studied their minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum 
bactericidal concentration. The promising safe FDA-approved candidates that show low mini-
mum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values can be chosen 
as lead molecules for further advanced studies.

Introduction
Lyme borreliosis, commonly referred to as Lyme disease, is the most common zoonotic 
bacterial disease in North America. It is estimated .300,000 cases per annum in USA 
are reported.1 Lyme disease is caused by the spirochetes of genus Borrelia, collectively 
known as Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. Among the genus, B. burgdorferi sensu 
stricto (B. burgdorferi s.s.) is the single major causative agent of the disease in USA. 
Other members in the group include Borrelia duttonii, Borrelia garinii, Borrelia afzelii, 
and Borrelia miyamotoi, which are involved in infections in Europe, Eurasia, and other 
parts of the world.2,3 Important clinical presentations of Lyme disease in humans include 
erythema migrans, fatigue, fever, chills, muscle, and joint pain.4,5 Approximately 
10%–20% of the patients who have been treated with antibiotic therapy reported the

reappearance of symptoms, such as muscle and joint pain and 
generalized fatigue. In some patients, these symptoms last 
for .6 months after the initial treatment. Several research-
ers categorize this condition as posttreatment Lyme disease 
syndrome (PTLDS), and it is observed in patients even after 
rigorous antibiotic treatment.6 However, the reason for the 
reoccurrence of these symptoms in some patients is unclear. 
This might be due to the hyperresponsive immune reaction 
to the deposited antigenic debris of the Borrelia or any drug-
tolerant persisters.7,8 Some researchers have raised the ques-
tion that Borrelia may persist in some hosts after antibiotic 
treatment, but the idea is controversial.9,10
In the absence of antibiotic therapy, B. burgdorferi can 
affect immunocompetent host and can establish long-term 
infections lasting years to lifelong in its natural (ie, mice) and 
incidental (ie, humans) hosts.11,12 Although current animal 
models (mice, dogs, and rhesus macaque monkeys) do not 
completely mimic human infection, studies have shown that 
antibiotic therapy with doxycycline, ceftriaxone, or tigecy-
cline did not fully eradicate B. burgdorferi, as determined by 
xenodiagnosis method.13–16 Many researchers have expressed 
their concerns on how the previously mentioned studies were 
conducted. Recent studies in mice showed a resurgence of 
B. burgdorferi after 12 months of treatment with antibiotics. 
Though Borrelia was not found when cultured, the RNA 
transcripts for multiple genes were detected.15 In a recent 
study, B. burgdorferi DNA was identified by xenodiagnosis 
in a human PTLDS patient despite antibiotic treatment.17
Three morphological forms of persistent B. burgdorferi 
were reported based on the observations from the experimental 
studies. They are spirochete, spheroplast (or l-form), micro-
colony, and round-body forms.10,18,19 Though there are some 
reports of spheroplast or round-body forms in humans, there 
is no clear study demonstrating whether these forms exist and 
cause clinical disease in humans.20 Recently, few systematic 
studies showed the presence of drug-tolerant B. burgdorferi 
persisters during in vitro culture. Sharma et al21 have demon-
strated that killing of B. burgdorferi by antibiotics is biphasic, 
with a small subpopulation of surviving persisters. This is one 
of the systematic studies that has revealed the existence of Bor-
relia persisters in vitro. In addition to this study, researchers 
showed the presence of antibiotic-tolerant persisters. Research-
ers have shown that the combination of three drugs, such as 
daptomycin, doxycycline, and cefoperazone, eradicated the 
most resistant microcolony form of B. burgdorferi persisters.7,22 
The currently prescribed drugs amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, and 
doxycycline are not able to eliminate the B. burgdorferi com-
pletely according to some studies,7,21–23 although other investi-
gators have shown the complete eradication of B. burgdorferi 
both in vitro and in vivo after relatively low dose or short course 
treatment with antibiotics.24–26 The surviving antibiotic-tolerant 
cells are not resistant mutants; upon regrowth, they form a new 
persister subpopulation. So, based on these observations, it is 
necessary to identify the potent drug candidates that can target 
the Borrelia persisters.
Due to the unmet need, studies using high-throughput 
screening (HTS) of drugs for B. burgdorferi are increasing, 
especially screening of drugs against persisters.7,27–30 HTS 
of medicinal compound libraries can help in identifying 
candidate molecules that can potentially be effective against 
the persisters and, therefore, can be used for therapeutic 
purposes. Recent studies of a number of compounds have 
facilitated the repurposing of drug molecules and their rapid 
approval for the treatment of different diseased conditions.31,32 
Moreover, the availability of structurally diverse entities in the 
HTS compound libraries can help in identifying the potential 
lead compounds that can be used for the antiborrelial drug 
discovery process. The current study was, therefore, aimed 
at testing multiple compound libraries for their potential to 
inhibit the growth of stationary-phase B. burgdorferi. Four 
drug-screening libraries were selected on the basis of the 
available pre/clinical data, structural diversity, and mecha-
nism of action of the compounds. Using recently developed 
highly sensitive BacTiter-Glo assay, four chemical libraries, 
such as the Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds 
(LOPAC1280), the National Institutes of Health Clinical Col-
lection (NIHCC), the Microsource Spectrum, and the Biomol 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA), were screened.33 
We found 150 inhibitory compounds that were found to be 
active against the stationary-phase form of Borrelia. The 
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum 
bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined for the 
top 20 FDA-approved compounds. The identified compounds 
can be further investigated for their therapeutic potential in 
preclinical animal models and in patients with Lyme disease. 
Moreover, the outcomes of the study can provide input for 
both mechanistic and translational research that can help in 
establishing clinically viable solutions to Lyme disease.
Materials and methods
Bacterial strains and culture
B. burgdorferi s.s. strains CA4 and CA8 originated bio-
logically from Ixodes pacificus ticks, USA. The bacterial 
strains were generously provided by Dr Robert Lane, 
University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA. These strains 
are infectious low passage numbers that were cultured in 
Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly II (BSK-II) complete medium, 
with 6% rabbit serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA).

High-throughput screening of drugs for Lyme disease
We have chosen these strains because these are infectious 
and prevalent in California, USA. The cultures were grown in 
sterile 50 mL Falcon tubes (Corning Incorporated, Corning, 
NY, USA) and incubated at 33°C. All culture media were 
sterilized with 0.2 µM filter units (EMD Millipore, Billerica, 
MA, USA). The B. burgdorferi cultures were grown for 
7–10 days to reach the stationary phase with cell den-
sity .108/mL for performing all the assays. For HTS drug 
screening, 7–10-day-old stationary-phase B. burgdorferi 
cultures were transferred to 384-well culture microplates.
Drugs and drug libraries
All the information regarding purchase, solubility, and stock 
solutions of drugs used in this study have been provided in 
Table 1. All the drug stocks were filter sterilized with 0.2 µM 
filter units. The FDA-approved drug libraries, such as the 
LOPAC1280, the NIHCC, the Microsource Spectrum, and the 
Biomol FDA (now Enzo Life Sciences) were acquired from 
High-Throughput Bioscience Center, Stanford University. 
All the library stocks were maintained in dimethyl sulfoxide 
solutions at 10 mM compound concentrations. Plate-to-plate 
dilutions were performed in 384-well plates using an Evolu-
tion P3 system equipped with a 384-well head.
HTS of chemical libraries with 
B. burgdorferi persisters
To identify the effect of chemical compounds on B. burgdorferi 
stationary-phase cultures qualitatively, HTS was performed 
using the following procedure. A total of 50 µL of BSK-II 
medium was added to white 384-well Corning plates (Corning 
Incorporated) using the Matrix Wellmate, and ~100 nL of 
each compound from the stock solution was added using 
the pin tool in the Staccato System (CaliperLS, Caliper Life 
Sciences Inc, Alameda, CA) to 1–22 columns. The last two 
columns of the 384 wells were left for culturing the controls. 
We screened one compound per well in a 384-well microplate 
format. These are screened in a 7-point titration ranging from 
25 µM, 12.5 µM, 7.25 µM, 3.625 µM, 1.81 µM, 0.9 µM, and 
0.45 µM. To these plates, 25 µL of 106/mL B. burgdorferi 
stationary-phase cultures were added using the Multidrop dis-
penser. Then the plates were incubated at 33°C for 96 hours in 
a humidified CO2 incubator (Forma Scientific, Waltham, MA, 
USA) having 5% CO2 and 95% air. After 96 hours, 25 µL of 
BacTiter-Glo reagent (Promega Corporation, Fitchburg, WI, 
USA) was added to the plates using the Multidrop dispenser. 
The plates were shaken for 2 minutes and incubated at room 
temperature for 5 minutes. Finally, the luminescence was 
measured using a Flexstation 3 (Molecular Devices LLC, 
Sunnyvale, CA, USA) (500 ms/well). The data were analyzed 
using the Assay Explorer software. Hits were identified as 
compounds that resulted in a decrease in the luciferase signal 
compared to controls with no compound.
Determination of MIC and MBC
The MIC of the small molecules identified through screening 
was determined by culturing 106/mL Borrelia in BSK-II 
medium with different concentrations (0.3–160 µM) of 
drugs. For MIC, 1 mL of cultures with respective drugs are

grown in 48-well plates in triplicates, wrapped with paraffin 
film and placed for 72 hours at 33°C in a humidified CO2 
incubator (Forma Scientific) having 5% CO2 and 95% air.23 
Cell proliferation was assessed using the bacterial counting 
chamber (Petroff-Hausser Counter, Horsham, PA, USA) by 
phase-contrast microscopy. At the same time, cell prolifera-
tion was also assessed using the BacTiter-Glo™ assay. The 
counting was performed in all the 25 squares of the central 
grid. The BacTiter-Glo™ assay is performed by mixing 
100 µL of culture in each well with 100 µL of BacTiter-Glo™ 
reagent (Promega Corporation). Then, the assay is performed 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Luminescence 
was measured using a Flexstation 3 microplate reader at 
luminescence 500 milliseconds.33
For determining MBC, 20 µL of the 106/mL Borrelia 
cultures grown in BSK-II medium for 72 hours at different 
drug concentrations were added to the fresh BSK-II medium 
and subcultured for 3 weeks.23,34–36 After a 3 week incubation 
period, the samples were observed microscopically for motile 
spirochetes in the culture. The MIC and MBC determinations 
were done thrice independently.
Time kill studies
Time kill studies were performed with borrelial isolate CA8 
(B. burgdorferi s.s.) with azlocillin sodium and cefotaxime 
acid. To determine the rate of antimicrobial activity, 106/mL 
Borrelia cultures were grown in BSK-II medium with 
drugs at different concentrations. BSK-II medium with no 
drugs was used as a control. The antibacterial activity was 
determined by counting bacteria at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 
72 hours. The experiment was done once with triplicates.34
Result
Development of BacTiter-Glo™ assay 
compatible to HTS
B. burgdorferi grows very slowly, typically taking from 
12 hours to 18 hours to replicate. Due to this slow growth, it is 
difficult to measure B. burgdorferi culture quantitatively using 
direct optical density. To measure the bacterial viability and 
antibiotic susceptibility of B. burgdorferi, several rapid colori-
metric assays, such as fluorogenic dye SYTO 9 (LIVE/DEAD) 
assay, Sytox Green/Hoechst 33342 assay, and SYBR Green I/
PI assay, have been developed.7,28,37 It was reported that SYBR 
Green I/PI assay can only detect accurately the live/dead ratio 
of 105 cells/mL.37 In parallel to these assays, we have devel-
oped a highly sensitive BacTiter-Glo™ assay, which has been 
optimized for 384-well plate.33 It is a one-step, straightforward 
method to assess bacterial viability by measuring ATP from 
the given sample. As it is a single-step assay, BacTiter-Glo™ 
assay can screen drugs quickly and efficiently in a large scale. 
We have recently reported that the BacTiter-Glo™ assay is a 
very sensitive assay that can reliably detect signal in the range 
of minimum ten Borrelia cells in phosphate-buffered saline 
and 7×103 in BSK-II medium.33 The BacTiter-Glo™ assay 
can only detect cells that can generate ATP. It has not been 
tested whether BacTiter-Glo™ assay can detect nongrowing 
Borrelia, which may produce low levels of ATP. Due to the 
advantage of detecting low number of bacteria (7×103) by this 
method, false-positive candidates are eliminated in the HTS. 
The BacTiter-Glo assay was validated by calculating Z′ values 
with the Assay Explorer software for CA4 and CA8 strains, 
which were .0.6, considered to be a good value to perform 
an HTS assay. The data indicate that the BacTiter-Glo™ 
assay provides a one-step, straightforward method to quantify 
B. burgdorferi with good sensitivity and dynamic range.
high-throughput primary screening 
of chemical libraries with B. burgdorferi 
persisters to identify potent drugs
To identify safe and effective molecules for Lyme disease 
treatment, repurposing FDA-approved drug molecules 
might be a fast and viable alternative in developing novel 
borrelicidal compounds. To achieve this, we utilized the 
BacTiter-Glo™ assay system. All the screening of drugs 
was done by stationary-phase CA8 borrelial cultures with 
cell density .108/mL, which are grown in BSK-II medium 
for 7–10 days. During screening, the last two rows in the 
384-well plate were taken as control by not adding any 
drugs. By using the HTS platform, we have screened 4,366 
chemical compounds representing different libraries, includ-
ing the Sigma LOPAC (1,280 compounds), the NIHCC (446 
compounds), the Microsource Spectrum (2,000 compounds), 
and the Biomol FDA (640 compounds). The screening was 
repeated for seven times with a titration range from 0.45 µM 
to 25 µM to confirm the reproducibility. That means each 
drug is tested at different concentrations in seven different 
plates. By successfully screening these libraries, we have 
identified ~150 hit molecules that showed the inhibition 
of bacterial growth .90% compared to the control. Out of 
these 150 hit molecules, 101 (67.3%) small molecules are 
FDA-approved compounds.
Based on the results from the primary screening, we chose 
the top 20 candidates and reconfirmed these by secondary 
screening with BacTiter-Glo™ assay. These candidates were 
chosen based on the .95% inhibition of bacteria in primary 
screening, FDA approval, and safety of the compounds 
(Table 2). The doxycycline, which is one of the currently

prescribed drugs inhibited 94.14% of borrelial growth 
compared to the control (no drug), which is less than the 
 
percentage of inhibition of the top 20 candidates (Table 2). 
Percentage inhibition was also one of the criteria for selecting 
top 20 candidates for testing. The results of the remaining 
130 compounds are shown in Table S1. Of the Borrelia cul-
tured with some of the drugs, the viability was evaluated with 
BacTiter-Glo™ assay as shown in Figure 1. In Figure 1A, 
 
tetraethylthiuram disulfide shows the complete borrelial cell 
inhibition at 1.25 µM, while epirubicin hydrochloride and 
doxorubicin hydrochloride are uniformly effective against 
B. burgdorferi at 0.625 µM. Vehicle control (dimethyl sul-
foxide) did not show any significant effect on the cell survival. 
 
Drugs azlocillin and cephalothin showed ~99% efficacy 
at 0.31 µM (Figure 1B). After confirming from secondary 
screening, the MIC and MBC values were determined by 
microdilution method for all the potential candidates.
Determinations of MIC and MBC values
To confirm the efficacy of the screening, MIC and MBC 
values were evaluated. The MIC is determined as the lowest 
concentration at which no motile spirochete is observed 
by microscopy. Of the top 20 candidates evaluated, the 
MIC values of epirubicin hydrochloride and doxorubicin 
hydrochloride are ,1 µM. For the drugs cefazolin sodium, 
gramicidin, azlocillin sodium, cefotaxime, and cephalothin

sodium, tetraethylthiuram disulfide, and linezolid, the MIC 
values are #3 µM. For the remaining drugs, the MIC val-
ues are $3 µM. The MBC was determined by subculturing 
20 µL of the Borrelia cultures grown at different drug 
concentrations in fresh BSK-II medium for 21 days.23,34 The 
MBC was determined when no spirochete was observed 
microscopically in the culture. Of the top 20 compounds, the 
lowest MBC values (,1.5 µM) were observed for epirubicin 
hydrochloride and doxorubicin hydrochloride. The drugs 
gramicidin, azlocillin sodium, leucomycin, cefotaxime, 
idarubicin, and tetraethylthiuram disulfide show the MBC 
values of #10 µM. All the remaining drugs show the MBC 
values of .10 µM. For the cephalothin sodium, the MIC 
value is very low, but the MBC value is .80 µM, and for 
tosufloxacin tosylate, both the MIC and MBC values are very 
high. The compounds doxorubicin, cephalothin, ticarcillin, 
and cefdinir were also reported in the HTS performed by 
Feng et al.29,38
Time kill studies
To determine the rate of antimicrobial activity of azlocillin 
sodium and cefotaxime acid, CA8 strain of Borrelia was 
exposed to different concentrations (0.625 µM, 1.25 µM, 
2.5 µM, and 5 µM) of each of the drugs. The initial Borrelia 
inoculum did not even decrease 1-log10-unit at concentrations 
0.625 µM and 1.25 µM for azlocillin sodium (Figure 2A).

High-throughput screening of drugs for Lyme disease
For cefotaxime acid at concentration 1.25 µM, the microbial 
growth is decreased 1-log10-unit but not at 0.625 µM 
(Figure 2B). Both azlocillin sodium and cefotaxime acid 
reduced morphologically intact motile cells to 3-log10-unit 
(99.9%) between 48 hours and 72 hours at concentrations 
2.5 µM and 5 µM. These specified concentrations of 2.5 µM 
and 5 µM are MIC values and twice the MIC values. In con-
trol, the Borrelia growth increased to 7-log10-unit.
Discussion
One of the major challenges in the discovery of potent thera-
peutically effective drug molecules is the lack of availability 
of sensitive screening tools. Though the procedure becomes 
fairly simple with the availability of HTS methods and large 
collections of drug libraries, the development of drugs against 
slow-growing organisms still remains an uphill task. Though 
a number of drugs have been tested and approved against 
various spirochetes, the currently available drug therapies, 
such as amoxicillin and doxycyclin, was unable to kill B. 
burgdorferi persisters in vitro.7,21 In addition to this, patients 
with Lyme who are diagnosed later and treated may develop 
arthritis. These patients treated later do not respond fully to a 
first course of antibiotic therapy.21,39 Therefore, efforts need 
to be made to develop an efficient platform for the screening 
of small molecules that can prove to be very effective, yet 
safe, in the treatment of Lyme disease.
In an effort to search for the lead molecules that can 
potentially be used for clinical application, we developed 
and used a faster, efficient, and reliable HTS platform for 
the screening of drug molecules against Borrelia. Current 
methods are not sensitive enough to detect the bacterial 
counts of ,105/mL.37 Due to this limitation, many potentially 
valuable hits would be lost during the compound-screening 
process. To avoid this, we developed a robust BacTiter-Glo 
assay. We exploited the dependence of B. burgdorferi on 
ATP as the major determinant of cell viability and their meta-
bolic activity by utilizing BacTiter-Glo assay.33 This assay 
involves the addition of an active reagent that binds with ATP 
molecules and releases a luminescent signal, indicating the 
presence of the viable microbes in the medium. In order to 
develop a faster, yet reliable assay, we optimized the assay 
for a 384-well HTS format.33
After developing and optimizing the assay, we focused 
on analyzing a diverse group of chemical compounds and 
drug libraries in order to identify the most effective agents 
that can inhibit the growth of Borrelia. For this purpose, 
we screened four different compound libraries that had a 
greater proportion (80%) of FDA-approved molecules in 
them. Approximately 4,366 drug molecules belonging to 
four different libraries, including the Sigma LOPAC, the 
NIHCC, the Microsource Spectrum, and the Biomol FDA, 
were screened. Of the four chemical libraries, except for 
the Microsource Spectrum, all the other libraries are 100% 
FDA approved. The compounds included in these libraries 
varied in their chemical structures, pharmacological classes, 
mechanisms of therapeutic action, and their origins. The 
rationale for selecting such a diverse group was to ensure that 
the identified compounds could find direct clinical applica-
tions or provide basis for lead compounds for drug design 
and development process.
We then exploited the developed HTS platform to identify 
the hit molecules that showed the inhibition of .90% based 
on the bacterial cell viability. A total of 150 molecules, both 
FDA approved and unapproved, were shortlisted from the 
different libraries. However, the utilization of approved drug 
molecules helps in shortening the timeline from bringing the 
drug from the lab to the bedside. Moreover, the availability of 
clinical pharmacological and toxicological data decreases the 
overall cost of the drug discovery process. Therefore, out of 
the obtained HTS hits, we selected 20 molecules based upon 
their FDA approval status, MIC values (,20 µM), percentage 
inhibition of stationary-phase cultures of Borrelia (.95%), 
and their reported safety profiles. The list of compounds 
that has been identified after an additional secondary screen 
(BacTiter-Glo), microscopic evaluation, and MIC and MBC 
determination is provided in Table 2. It was found that the 
identified compounds have been reported to exploit a num-
ber of mechanisms to exhibit their pharmacological action 
in other bacterial species. The identification of compounds 
using multiple pathways for their borrelicidal effects provides 
an opportunity for using these drugs in clinical setup as com-
bination therapy or possible therapeutic equivalents.
Among the identified drug molecules, erythromycin and 
kitasamycin appeared to be very active. The drug erythro-
mycin was already used clinically for the treatment of Lyme 
disease. In some laboratories, strains and clinical isolates of 
B. burgdorferi show resistance to erythromycin.40 This drug 
belongs to the macrolide group of antibiotics, which exhibit 
their antibacterial potential by blocking the protein synthesis 
assembly of the bacteria. By targeting peptidyltransferase of 
the bacteria, macrolides tend to cause the termination of pro-
tein chain elongation and the detachment of the enzyme from 
the ribosomes, resulting in the bacterial protein inhibition.41 
Moreover, the drug molecules have also proved their effec-
tiveness as immune modulators in the treatment of various 
inflammatory conditions.42,43 The drugs, erythromycin and 
kitasamycin, are readily absorbed, and they diffuse into 
most of the body fluids.44–46 Additionally, their biochemical

features make them extremely capable for intracellular and 
tissue penetration. The availability of the antibiotics in the 
drug-sequestered sites can potentially be helpful in clearing 
bacteria from skin and joints.47–49 Additionally, a high per-
centage inhibition of stationary-phase culture forms of the 
bacteria and the low MIC and MBC values establish that 
these drug molecules can be helpful in treating both dividing 
and persistent forms of Borrelia.
One of the other drug molecules, linezolid, was found to 
possess ~98% inhibition of the stationary-phase Borrelia in 
the initial screen. Moreover, the drug was found to possess 
the MIC and MBC values of 0.4 µg/mL and 8.4 µg/mL, 
respectively. The probable mechanism of action of linezolid 
is also by retarding the initiation step of protein translation. It 
tends to bind to the active site of the 50S ribosomal assembly 
and prevents the downstream translation process, resulting in 
the termination of normal protein synthesis in the bacteria.44,47 
Linezolid possesses commendable pharmacokinetic profile 
with up to 100% bioavailability after oral administration and 
has a high volume of distribution.48,49 It is efficiently distrib-
uted in most of the body tissues, including osteoarticular and 
central nervous system.50,51 Another group of compounds 
that demonstrated significant reduction in bacterial growth 
included the anthracycline-based antitumor antibiotics, 
ie, epirubicin, doxorubicin, and idarubicin. These drugs, 
primarily used for treating cancer conditions, tend to non-
selectively intercalate between the nucleotides and prevent 
DNA replication. Moreover, they inhibit the topoisomerase II 
(bacterial equivalent DNA gyrase) and prevent the relaxation 
of DNA supercoiling, leading to decreased replication and 
transcription processes.52 Additionally, these drugs cause 
genome and transcriptome level damage by causing the 
 
generation of free oxygen radicals and disassembly of his-
tone proteins.53 All these anthracycline antibiotics possess 
exceptional pharmacokinetic profile. Though these molecules 
are very effective as cytotoxic agents for the treatment of 
cancer conditions, their use is often limited by their ability 
to cause cardiotoxicity, neutropenia, and other adverse drug 
reactions.54 Modifications in the formulation or developing 
safer therapeutic drug molecules based on the anthracycline 
ring can be helpful in finding acceptable alternate strategies 
against the drug-tolerant Borrelia persisters.7
Moxifloxacin, a fourth-generation fluoroquinolone, also 
showed a good inhibitory effect on the stationary-phase cul-
tures of Borrelia. The drug specifically targets DNA gyrase, 
both topoisomerase II and topoisomerase IV, and causes the 
cessation of uncoiling and the separation of double-stranded 
DNA, resulting in the inhibition of bacterial replication 
process.55 Moxifloxacin, also available in the oral formulation, 
has .80% bioavailability. The drug has been known to target 
various bacteria in the tissues that are generally considered as 
drug-sequestered sites, including brain, lungs, and bones.56 It 
has also been proved to be up to ten times more potent and 
effective in treating other intracellular bacteria involved in 
latent infections, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, than 
other drugs of the same group.57 Another fluoroquinolone, 
tosufloxacin, also showed comparable inhibitory activity of 
the borrelial stationary-phase cultures (.97% inhibition). 
However, the MIC and MBC values of the compound were 
greater than moxifloxacin. The drug also targets the DNA 
gyrase and has appreciable pharmacokinetic properties.58 
Based on these pharmacological properties, moxifloxacin 
and tosufloxacin appear to be a safe and effective alternate 
for the currently available amoxicillin- or doxycycline-based 
antiborrelial therapeutic strategies.
The study also identified a number of drug molecules 
that target the cell wall synthesis of bacterial species. Among 
these, the parenteral antipseudomonal penicillins, azlocil-
lin and ticarcillin, were found to be quite potent against 
the stationary-phase and growing forms of B. burgdorferi. 
These penicillins tend to target the transpeptidase enzyme 
of the bacteria, resulting in the inability of the growing pep-
tidoglycan layer of the cell wall to cross-link.59 Penicillins, 
bearing a smaller molecular structure, tend to pass through 
the cell wall and inhibit the enzyme. This leads to the 
generation of spheroplast or cell wall-lacking forms of the 
bacteria, which are highly susceptible to cytolysis and cell 
death. Being β-lactam antibiotics, these drug molecules are 
highly susceptible to the action of β-lactamase-like enzymes. 
However, the use of aminoglycosides or clavulanates in the 
antibiotic regimen has proved to be effective in overcoming 
the issues of drug resistance.
Using our HTS method, we were also able to identify some 
cephalosporins that were very active against the persistent 
forms of Borrelia. Cephalothin, cefdinir, cefotaxime acid, 
and ceftazidime had a bacterial inhibition value of .98%. 
Cephalosporins follow a mechanism similar to penicillins 
for demonstrating their antibacterial effects. However, 
these drugs are more resistant to the action of β-lactamases. 
Cephalothin, cefotaxime acid, and ceftazidime are the first- 
and third-generation parenteral cephalosporins. Cefdinir, 
however, is a third-generation oral cephalosporin having up 
to 25% bioavailability.60 A number of cephalosporins have 
been proved to possess remarkable activity against a number 
of bacteria, including B. burgdorferi.35
Another group of agents that were found to be active 
against the stationary phase of B. burgdorferi, with .97% 
inhibition, were the mobile ion carriers or ionophores.

High-throughput screening of drugs for Lyme disease
Valinomycin and calcimycin act as ionophores that mediate 
the transport of charged molecules across the bacterial cell 
wall causing an imbalance in the electrochemical gradient.61 
Gramicidin, following a similar mechanism of action, tends 
to form a channel in the bacterial wall and help in the trans-
fer of ions across the bacterial membrane. All three drug 
molecules, valinomycin, calcimycin, and gramicidin, along 
with osmotic imbalance cause an associated disruption in the 
normal oxidative phosphorylation process of the bacterial cell 
leading, ultimately, to the death of the bacteria. Though the 
toxicity of ionophores is generally very well known in living 
systems, these drug molecules can be investigated for their 
potential to be used in combination therapy against various 
serious infectious diseases.
An interesting drug candidate identified in the study was 
the alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor, disulfiram. Though 
the drug is used as a treatment of alcohol abuse, recently 
its anticancer potential has also been discovered. It has 
been known to make complexes with metal ions and cause 
the disruption of the proteasome, leading to death of the 
cancer cells. Similarly, the metabolites of the drug molecule 
have been known to significantly inhibit the growth of a 
number of bacterial species, including the biofilm-forming 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa.62 The drug molecule has a good 
bioavailability, and it passes the blood–brain barrier to show 
its effect in the central nervous system. Though most of the 
studies are concerned to the use of the drug molecule in 
alcoholism yet, being a safe, FDA-approved molecule, the 
drug can be repurposed for its antibacterial potential.
As we observe that azlocillin sodium and cefotaxime acid 
show low MIC values, we studied time kill studies to deter-
mine the rate of antimicrobial activity. In our observation, 
both azlocillin sodium and cefotaxime acid reduced Borrelia 
no 3-log10-unit (99.9%) between 48 hours and 72 hours at 
concentrations 2.5 µM and 5 µM, respectively.
The identified compounds can potentially provide 
effective antibacterial cover against the persister forms of 
B. burgdorferi, if indeed such forms can be proven to exist in 
patients treated for Lyme disease who remain symptomatic. 
The drug molecules exploit multiple mechanisms to show 
their inhibitory effects. Moreover, due to the broad variety 
of molecules, multiple routes of administration and dosage 
forms can be developed for effectively treating the Lyme 
disease infections. In summary, this study has provided 
a mean to screen a large number of compounds using a 
highly sensitive, reliable, and rapid platform. The assay has 
identified a number of FDA-approved drug molecules with 
their potential to be repurposed for use against both Lyme 
disease and the associated PTLDS. In addition to identify 
drugs and evaluate the MIC and MBC values, further studies 
should be done by using in vitro persisters’ model to prove 
whether these drugs have potential to eliminate persisters or 
not.21 However, additional preclinical and clinical data can 
substantiate the use of these drug molecules for repurposing 
and clinical acceptance, thereafter.
