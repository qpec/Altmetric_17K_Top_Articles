Abstract
Background The ReCharge Trial demonstrated that a vagal
blocking device (vBloc) is a safe and effective treatment for
moderate to severe obesity. This report summarizes 24-month
outcomes.
Methods Participants with body mass index (BMI) 40 to 45 kg/
m2, or 35 to 40 kg/m2 with at least one comorbid condition were
randomized to either vBloc therapy or sham intervention for
12 months. After 12 months, participants randomized to vBloc
continued open-label vBloc therapy and are the focus of this
report. Weight loss, adverse events, comorbid risk factors, and
quality of life (QOL) will be assessed for 5 years.
Results At 24 months, 123 (76 %) vBloc participants remained
in the trial. Participants who presented at 24 months (n = 103)
had a mean excess weight loss (EWL) of 21 % (8 % total weight
loss [TWL]); 58 % of participants had ≥5 % TWL and 34 % had
≥10 % TWL. Among the subset of participants with abnormal
preoperative values, significant improvements were observed in
mean LDL (−16 mg/dL) and HDL cholesterol (+4 mg/dL), tri-
glycerides (−46 mg/dL), HbA1c (−0.3 %), and systolic
(−11 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressures (−10 mmHg). QOL
measures were significantly improved. Heartburn/dyspepsia and
implant site pain were the most frequently reported adverse
events. The primary related serious adverse event rate was 4.3 %.
Conclusions vBloc therapy continues to result in medically
meaningful weight loss with a favorable safety profile through
2 years.

Introduction
Intermittent vagal blockade (vagal blocking device [vBloc] ther-
apy) was developed as a less invasive alternative to standard
bariatric surgery. It was conceived and developed based on prior
reports of vagotomy as a treatment for obesity [1, 2]. Its mech-
anism of action is thought to involve reducing sensations of
hunger. The device, the Maestro Rechargeable System, delivers
low energy, high frequency, intermittent, electrical pulses to the
intra-abdominal vagal trunks for a predetermined number of
hours each day and is implanted using standard minimally inva-
sive laparoscopic surgical techniques. Previous reports of ran-
domized clinical trials on vBloc therapy have demonstrated
meaningful weight loss, improvement in obesity related

 comorbid conditions such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM),
and a low rate of serious complications [3–5].
The effect of vBloc on weight loss in the ReCharge Trial has
been previously reported up to 18 months [3, 6]. The estimated
mean percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) was 26 %
(10 % total weight loss [%TWL]) for vBloc and 17 % (6 %
TWL) for Sham at 12 months (p < 0.001). From 12 to
18 months, the vBloc arm maintained its weight loss while
the Sham arm regained 40 % of weight lost at 12 months, so
that at 18 months the mean %EWL was 24 % (9 % TWL) for
vBloc versus 10 % EWL (4 % TWL) for the Sham arm
(p < 0.001) [6]. Sham participants crossed over to active
vBloc therapy or withdrew from the study after the 18-month
visit. Documentation of the longer-term durability of weight
loss, improvements in comorbidities, and safety of vBloc ther-
apy is required. This report summarizes safety and efficacy data
from the vBloc arm of the ReCharge Trial at 24 months.
Methods
Participants
The study design and methods of the ReCharge Trial study
have been described previously [3, 6]. The study participants
were enrolled both in the USA (eight sites) and in Australia
(two sites). BMI inclusion criteria were 35 to 40 kg/m2 with at
least one obesity-related comorbidity (T2DM, hypertension,
dyslipidemia, sleep apnea syndrome, or obesity related cardio-
myopathy) or BMI of 40 to 45 kg/m2 with or without comor-
bidities. Prior to enrollment, the trial protocols were approved
by the Institutional Review Boards at each site and informed
consent was collected from all participants.
Study Design
The ReCharge Trial is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial
comparing vBloc therapy delivered to the intra-abdominal vagal
trunks via the Maestro Rechargeable System to a sham surgical
procedure with the implantation of a sham device. The primary
efficacy and safety outcomes were assessed at 12 months.
Following the completion of all 12 month visits, participants
were unblinded to their treatment assignment. Patients random-
ized to the Sham arm were given the option of crossing over to
receive active vBloc therapy or withdrawing from the trial.
Participants randomized to the vBloc arm continued to receive
open-label vBloc therapy. Study design mandates that all partic-
ipants in the ReCharge Trial are to be followed for a total of
5 years following implantation with an active vBloc device.
The safety of the study was monitored by an independent
Data and Safety Monitoring Board, and all serious adverse
events (SAEs) were independently adjudicated for relatedness
by an independent clinical events committee (CEC). The
study received institutional review board (IRB) or ethics com-
mittee (EC) approval from Bellberry Limited EC, Scottsdale
Clinical Research Institute Scottsdale Healthcare, Tufts
Medical Center IRB, Oregon Health & Science University
IRB, Mayo Clinic Rochester IRB, Stanford University
Medical Center IRB, University of Minnesota IRB, Scripps
IRB, and Western IRB. The study was registered on
clinicaltrials.gov with the identifier NCT01327976.
Intervention
The Maestro Rechargeable System consists of two leads placed
around the anterior and posterior vagal trunks near the gastro-
esophageal junction using standard laparoscopic surgery and a
rechargeable neuroregulator which is placed subcutaneously on
the thoracic wall. The device is recharged transcutaneously [7].
Devices were programmed to 13 h of therapy per day to deliver
at least 12 h of therapy daily since therapy cannot be delivered
during recharging. The goal current amplitude was 6 mA.
Investigators could adjust daily therapy duration and/or current
amplitude based on weight loss and therapy tolerability. The
average therapy delivery per day through 2 years was
11.5 ± 3.2 h at an average current amplitude of 5.9 ± 1 mA.
Monthly follow-up visits occurred between 12 and 24 months
with a 2-week visit window. At each clinic follow-up visit, all
participants were asked to participate in 15-min individual edu-
cational discussions on healthy food choices, exercise, and be-
havioral modification. Additionally, group weight management
sessions were held approximately every 3 months. Of note, no
new weight management material was provided in the second
year of the trial; weight management advisors revisited topics at
their discretion that had been discussed in the first year of the trial.
Study Objectives
The objective of the current report was to evaluate the impact
of vBloc therapy on weight loss, obesity-related comorbid
conditions, quality of life, and safety at 24 months. The
Sham arm is no longer a valid comparator to the vBloc group
at 2 years given the appreciable rate of either cross-over to an
active vBloc device or withdrawal from the trial. Weight loss
was assessed as %EWL using the BMI 25 kg/m2 method and
%TWL. At every study visit, adverse events were collected
using standard case report forms to capture the event type,
investigator-attributed relatedness, seriousness, and severity.
Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured at base-
line and at every visit. Blood pressure (in triplicate), laboratory
parameters, and waist circumference were assessed at baseline
and at yearly visits. The laboratory parameters of focus in this
170
OBES SURG (2017) 27:169–176
 report were those known to be improved with significant weight
loss: total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholester-
ol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides,
fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).
The ReCharge Trial did not require that patients have elevated
levels of these parameters to be eligible for enrollment, and many
patients were well controlled on medications throughout the trial.
However, a significant number of participants presented with
abnormal metabolic and cardiovascular parameters, therefore,
in addition to assessing change in these parameters among all
participants, we also examined the change among participants
with abnormal (i.e., elevated or low) levels of these parameters
at baseline.
Quality of life (QOL) was assessed at baseline and every
6 months using the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite
(IWQOL-Lite), a validated QOL instrument with 31 questions
that measures five domains: physical function, self-esteem,
sexual life, public distress, and work [8]. Scores range from
0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better QOL. Changes
in eating were evaluated using the Three-Factor Eating
Questionnaire (TFEQ) at baseline and every 6 months. The
TFEQ is a validated, self-report questionnaire that is used to
measure the psychological constructs of eating on three sub-
scales: cognitive restraint (0–21 scale), disinhibition (0–16
scale), and hunger (0–14 scale) [9].
Pre-Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome Assessment
Exploratory assessments were done to determine if partici-
pants who presented with either pre-diabetes or metabolic
syndrome at baseline still had the syndrome at 12 and
24 months. Pre-diabetes was defined according to the
American Diabetes Association (ADA) diagnostic criteria
for elevated FPG (≥100 to 125 mg/dL) and/or elevated
HbA1c (≥5.7 and <6.5 %) for patients without diabetes and
not on medications for endocrine disorders [10].
The metabolic syndrome definition used was taken from
the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) with the
presence of three of the following conditions: elevated waist
circumference (men >102 cm, women >88 cm), elevated tri-
glycerides (≥150 mg/dL), low HDL (men <40 mg/dL, women
<50 mg/dL), elevated blood pressure (≥130/85 mmHg or use
of hypertension medications), and elevated FPG (≥110 mg/
dL) [11].
Statistical Analysis
No statistical analysis plan was pre-specified for evaluation of
changes after the 12-month primary assessment. For this re-
port, the statistical significance of changes in weight and other
continuous parameters in the vBloc group were evaluated
using paired t tests comparing participants’ baseline values
to their follow-up values. No statistical hypothesis tests were
used for categorical parameters. All analyses are reported as
complete case analyses without imputation or adjustment for
multiple comparisons. P values less than 0.05 were considered
statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed
using SAS version 9.3.
Results
Baseline Characteristics and Participant Disposition
The baseline characteristics of the ReCharge Trial patient pop-
ulation have been summarized previously [3]. Of the 162 par-
ticipants randomized to the vBloc group, 87 % were female,
the mean age was 47 years, the mean BMI was 41 kg/m2
, 39 %
had hypertension, 56 % had dyslipidemia, and 20 % had ob-
structive sleep apnea. Nine participants (6 %) had T2DM.
Seventy-six percent of the randomized vBloc participants
(n = 123) remained in the trial at 24 months. The reasons for
withdrawals in the vBloc group were as follows: 23 (14.2 %)
subject decisions, 9 (5.6 %) for an adverse event, 2 lost to
follow-up (1.2 %), and the other 5 due to intra-operative ex-
clusions as a result of which the vBloc device was not im-
planted, which has been described previously [3]. The with-
drawals for an adverse event were due to pain at the
neuroregulator site in five cases, the need for MRI in two
cases, heartburn in one case, and abdominal pain in another.
As previously reported, eight participants required nine revi-
sions in the first year of the study [3]. There were four addi-
tional revisions between 12 and 24 months: two due to the
adverse event of pain at the neuroregulator site, one due to
twisted leads caused by the participant chronically rotating the
neuroregulator in the subcutaneous pocket (BTwiddler’s
syndrome^) where both leads and the neuroregulator were
replaced, and one due to the inability to consistently recharge
the neuroregulator which a neuroregulator replacement
remedied. All revisions were uncomplicated, and the patients
were released on the day of or day following the procedure.
Weight Loss
The mean EWL among vBloc participants who present-
ed for the 24-month visit was 21 % (95 % CI 16 to
26 %); the mean percent TWL was 8 % (95 % CI 6 to
10 %). Twenty participants did not present for the visit
but remained in the study. The percentage of partici-
pants who achieved various TWL thresholds from at
least 5 % to at least 15 % TWL were similar at 12
and 24 months (Table 1). Only 24 participants of the
OBES SURG (2017) 27:169–176
171
 77 randomized to the Sham arm remained in the trial
who had not yet crossed over to active vBloc therapy.
However, the mean weight loss among these individuals
was only 4 % EWL (1 % TWL).
Improvements in Cardiovascular, Anthropometric,
and Metabolic Parameters
Mean screening values for cardiovascular and anthropo-
metric risk factors with average changes at yearly
follow-up visits for all vBloc participants who presented
for the visit and for the subset of participants with ab-
normal screening values are provided in Table 2.
Overall, the improvements from baseline in systolic
and diastolic blood pressure and waist circumference
were significant; those with elevated blood pressure at
baseline had two to three times greater improvements,
which were also statistically significant.
Mean screening values and 12- and 24-month mean
changes for metabolic obesity risk factors are shown for
all vBloc participants who presented for the visit as well
as those with abnormal screening values in Table 3.
Among all vBloc participants, 24-month improvements
from baseline were statistically significant for LDL cho-
lesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and HbA1c.
Improvements were greater for all parameters among
participants whose values were abnormal at baseline.
Fasting plasma glucose was the only metabolic parame-
ter that was not significantly impacted at 24 months.
Among the subset of participants who met the criteria
for metabolic syndrome at baseline, 50 % remitted from
that diagnosis at 12 months and 47 % by 24 months
(Table 4). Similarly, among the participants who were
pre-diabetic at screening, 57 % had normal glucose pro-
files at 12 months and 50 % had normal values at
24 months (Table 5).
Quality of Life and Food Intake-Behavior
Significant improvements from baseline were observed
in the IWQOL-Lite questionnaire at both 12 and
24 months among participants who received vBloc ther-

 apy (Table 6). From a mean score of 57 (on a 0 to 100
scale, where higher scores indicate greater quality of
life), the mean improvement from screening was 20
points at both yearly visits.
As shown in Table 6, each of the three factors on the TFEQ
results improved significantly from baseline. The hunger fac-
tor, of greatest interest since decreasing hunger and earlier
satiety are considered to be the mechanism of action of
vBloc therapy [7], was significantly decreased from a mean
of 8 points (on a 0–14 scale, where higher scores indicate
experiencing more sensations of hunger) at screening to 4
points at 12 months, which was sustained at 24 months. The
disinhibition factor, which measures the ability to control
emotional or social eating, and cognitive restraint, which as-
sesses the ability to avoid weight-gaining behaviors by limit-
ing consumption, was also significantly improved.

 Safety
The related adverse event profile of the vBloc device cumu-
latively through 24 months was similar to that reported at
12 months (Table 7) [3]. The most frequently reported related
adverse events were heartburn and dyspepsia, neuroregulator
site pain, other pain, abdominal pain, incision pain, nausea,
eructation/belching, and dysphagia. Ninety-four percent of all
adverse events were reported as mild or moderate in severity,
and 83 % of events had resolved by 24 months.
All primary endpoint-related serious adverse events
have been previously reported through 18 months, so
the rate remained constant at 4.3 % [3, 6]. Three serious
adverse events of infection, confusion with hallucina-
tions, and brain tumor were reported and adjudicated
by the independent clinical events committee to be un-
related to vBloc therapy.
Discussion
Intermittent vagal blockade using the vBloc device for
24 months in the ReCharge Trial demonstrated sustained
weight loss, significant improvements in obesity related
cardiovascular and metabolic parameters, and a low rate
of significant adverse events. Vagal block treated partic-
ipants achieved 21 % EWL (8 % TWL) at 24 months,
similar to the weight loss at 12 and 18 months [3, 6].
In the vBloc-treated participants, significant improve-
ments from baseline in blood pressure, lipids, and gly-
cemic control were observed at 24 months; and, among
participants beginning with abnormal values, the im-
provements were even more substantial. The prevalence
of pre-diabetes and metabolic syndrome was halved
among those participants who had those conditions at
baseline. Most adverse events were reported as mild or

 moderate in severity, and there were no serious long-
term consequences, such as nutritional deficiencies,
which have been reported for conventional bariatric
surgery.
Quality of life and eating behaviors of vagal blocking
therapy participants were significantly improved.
Measures from the IWQOL-Lite suggest that the weight
loss achieved by participants treated with vBloc led to
clinically meaningful improvements in the impact of
weight and obesity on the quality of their lives. As
had been hypothesized, results from the TFEQ suggest
that a substantial reduction in hunger (i.e., feelings of
satiety) were achieved and sustained, with identical re-
ductions in the average hunger factor of the TFEQ at
both 12 and 24 months. Likewise, measures of disinhi-
bition and cognitive restraint in the TFEQ improved,
suggesting that vagal block treated participants felt they
had better control over emotional eating and weight-
gaining behaviors.
vBloc therapy results in less weight loss than has been
reported with the conventional procedures sleeve gastrectomy
and gastric bypass. However, in considering the comparative
benefit/risk profile, the weight loss achieved with vBloc led to
improvements in comorbidities (notably pre-diabetes and met-
abolic syndrome), quality of life, and control over hunger with
fewer risks than the conventional bariatric procedures. For
example, complications observed in the STAMPEDE Trial
of gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy compared to medical
therapy for the treatment of diabetes through 3 years included
intra-abdominal bleeding (and subsequent need for transfu-
sion), gastrointestinal leak, bowel obstruction, dehydration re-
quiring intravenous treatment, stricture, ulcers, and
ketoacidosis [12, 13]. Weight loss with vBloc was shown to
be similar to that reported for laparoscopic adjustable gastric
banding (LAGB) in a 2-year report comparing bypass, sleeve,
and LAGB where the completed case evaluation showed
6 ± 8.2 % TWL with LAGB compared to 8 ± 9.5 % TWL
with vBloc [14].
The limitations of the present report include missing data
and the lack of a blinded control group. The ReCharge Trial
has been unblinded, and participants are now receiving open-
label vBloc therapy, so the study is subject to the limitations
inherent in an uncontrolled design with more limited follow-
up. It is reassuring that the magnitude of the improvements
from baseline at 24 months in weight loss, cardiovascular risk
and metabolic parameters, and patient-reported measures are
similar to 12 months, when the blind and sham control were
still in effect.
Conclusions
Intermittent vagal blockade with vBloc therapy produces
medically meaningful weight loss through 2 years, with a
favorable safety profile and sustained improvements in
obesity-related cardiovascular risk factors, healthy eating be-
haviors, and quality of life.
