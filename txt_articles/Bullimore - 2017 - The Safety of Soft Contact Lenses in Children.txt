 The Safety of Soft Contact Lenses in Children
Mark A. Bullimore*
ABSTRACT
Purpose. There is increasing interest in fitting children with soft contact lenses. This review collates data from a range of
studies to estimate the incidence of complications, specifically corneal infiltrative events and microbial keratitis, in patients
under the age of 18 years.
Methods. Peer-review papers were identified using PubMed and the Webof Science. A broad range of studies are summarized
including large-scale epidemiological studies of contact lensYrelated complications, hospital-based case series, long- and
short-term prospective studies, and multicenter retrospective studies.
Results. Nine prospective studies representing 1800 patient years of wear in 7- to 19-year-olds include safety outcomes. In
three large prospective studies representing between 159 and 723 patient years of soft contact lens wear in patients 8 to 14
years, the incidence of corneal infiltrative events is up to 136 per 10,000 years. Data from a large retrospective study show
similar rates of corneal infiltrative events: 97 per 10,000 years in 8- to 12-year-olds (based on 411 patient years of wear) and
335 per 10,000 years in 13- to 17-year-olds (based on 1372 patient years of wear). None of the prospective studies report
any cases of microbial keratitis. Five clinical studies where safety data are not reported constitute a further 493 patient years.
One retrospective study found no cases of microbial keratitis occurred in 8- to 12-year-olds (411 patient years) and an
incidence of 15 per 10,000 patient years in 13- to 17-year-olds (1372 patient years)Vno higher than the incidence of
microbial keratitis in adults wearing soft contact lenses on an overnight basis.
Conclusions. The overall picture is that the incidence of corneal infiltrative events in children is no higher than in adults,
and in the youngest age range of 8 to 11 years, it may be markedly lower.

n the past decade, there has been increasing interest in fitting
children with contact lenses. This has been driven by patients,
parents, practitioners, and the contact lens research commu-
nity and is caused by the increased interest in myopia control1Y6
and the improved self-esteem and quality of life enjoyed by
children wearing contact lenses.7Y9 Furthermore, the introduction
of daily disposable soft lenses obviates the need for cleaning and
storage, making them an attractive option for children and
teenagers alike.10,11 Indeed, Chalmers et al.12 recently reported
that, among patients of all ages in a prospective registry, only two
corneal infiltrative events occurred in 960 patient years of daily
disposable soft lens wear (489 years silicone hydrogel and 471
years hydrogel)Van incidence of corneal infiltrative events of 21
per 10,000 years.
Contact lensYrelated adverse events fall into two categories:
seriousVnotably microbial keratitisVand non-serious. The latter
category typically includes episodes of a painful red eye such as
contact lensYinduced acute red eye (CLARE) with and without
infiltrates, contact lens peripheral ulcer (CLPU), and infiltrative
keratitis. Of course, some events may be allergic in origin and may
not involve the cornea, so researchers often use the term corneal
infiltrative events to indicate corneal involvement beyond mere
staining or superficial punctate keratitis. Corneal infiltrative
events (CIEs) may be defined as a noninfectious infiltration of
white blood cells into the avascular corneal stroma, often with
accompanying hyperemia.12 Microbial keratitis is a subset of this
category, but usually accounts for around 5% of all corneal
infiltrative events.13,14 Microbial keratitis may be defined as one
or more corneal stromal infiltrates greater than 1 mm in size with
pain more than mild, and one or more of the following: anterior
chamber reaction more than minimal, mucopurulent discharge,
or positive corneal culture,15 although variations are common.
All soft contact lenses approved by the United States Food and
Drug Administration for daily and overnight wear carry no age
restriction, implying that they are safe in both adults and children.

 But what is the evidence for this assertion? Are soft contact lenses
less safe, equally safe, or safer in children than in adults? This review
ofthe peer-reviewedscientificliteraturepresents datafromarangeof
different types of clinical studies related to the usage and safety of
contact lenses in children in an attempt to address this question.
Surveys of Practitioner Attitudes and Behavior
Sindt and Riley reported results of a survey mailed to 4004
American Optometric Association practicing member optometrists
in July 2010.16 A total of 576 surveys were returned for a response
rate of 14.4%Va rate that can clearly result in bias. Nearly all
respondingoptometrists (97%) reportedfittingcontactlenspatients
under the age of 18, and these patients represent 41% of the total
contact lens patient population in the practices of respondents. Fig. 1
shows the age at which practitioners feel it appropriate to introduce a
child to soft contact lenses. Over 70% feel that children can be in-
troduced to these lenses at 12 years of age or younger. Responding
optometrists most often fit spectacles as the primary method of vision
correction in children ages 8 to 9 (51%) and 10 to 12 (71%). A
gradual shift in optometrists’ approach to vision correction occurs as
children get older, with 21% noting that they were more likely to fit
10- to 12-year-olds in contact lenses than they were a year before.
Nearlyhalf(49%)prescribecontactlensesfirstfor13-to14-year-olds,
and 66% recommend contact lenses as the main form of vision
correction for 15- to 17-year-olds. Reasons for doctors who are now
more likely to fit children in contact lenses include availability of daily
disposable lenses (30%), improved contact lens materials (23%),
requests from the child or parent (19%), recent research or studies
(10%), and children’s participation in activities and sports.
Efron et al. summarized 13 years of survey data from 1650
responses from US practitioners representing 7702 contact lens
fits.17 Each year, 1000 US-based practitioners were asked about
the first 10 contact lens fits performed after receipt of the ques-
tionnaire. They report that patients 15 years and under account
for 11% of lens fits, although no further data on children are
provided. With respect to the global community, Efron et al. sent
up to 1000 survey forms to contact lens fitters in each of 38
countries between January and March every year from 2005 to
2009.10 Practitioners were asked to record data relating to the first
10 contact lens fits or refits performed after receiving the survey
form. Data were received relating to 105,734 fits: 137 infants (0.1%),
1,672 children (6Y12 years, 1.6%), 12,117 teenagers (13Y17 years,
11.5%), and 91,808 adults (86.8%). The proportion of minors (G18
years old) fitted varied considerably between nations, ranging from
25%inIcelandto1%inChina,withtheUSrankedfourthwith17%:
13% 13- to 17-year-olds and 4% 6- to 12-year-olds. Children are
fitted with the highest proportion of daily disposable lenses and have
the highest rate of fits for part-time wear.Teenagers have a similar lens
fitting profile to adults, with the main distinguishing characteristic
being a higher proportion of new fits. Orthokeratology fits repre-
sented 28% of all rigid contact lenses prescribed to minors, including
47% of 6- to 12-year-olds, and the authors attribute this to growing
popularity of myopia control. Children have the highest proportion
(925%) of newly prescribed daily disposable lensesVfollowed by
teenagers and adultsVconsistent with the view of Walline et al. that
this replacement frequency is especially suited to children and teen-
agers.11 The authors assert that the simplicity of daily replacement,
without the need for lens cleaning and maintenance, is likely to en-
hancecompliance.Itshouldbenotedthattheabovedatarepresentthe
proportions of contact lens fitsVboth new and refits. The proportion
of children fit may thus overstate the proportion of children in the

Major Epidemiological Studies
Contact lensYrelated adverse events have been studied extensively
and comprehensively for some 30 years. Researchers have quantified
the incidence of serious events, notably microbial keratitis, associ-
ated with different modalities along with the patient-related factors
associated with non-serious and serious events.18Y22 Microbial kera-
titis was defined in these studies as either a positive corneal culture or a
corneal infiltrate and overlying epithelial defect with at least one of the
following: any part of the lesion being within the central 4 mm of the
cornea, an anterior chamber response, or pain. Cases were usually
classified as mild, moderate, or severe with the latter including loss of
twoormorelines ofbest-correctedvisualacuity,surgicalintervention,
or both. Overnight wear is an unequivocal risk factor for microbial
keratitis among soft contact lens wearers. Risk factors for microbial
keratitis with daily wear include poor storage case hygiene, infrequent
storage case replacement, solution type, male gender, high socio-
economic status, smoking, and occasional overnight lens use.20,22
Children are rarely represented in these studies.
Dart et al.,18 Stapleton et al.,21 and Keay et al.19 all only report
cases in patients 15 years and older, although it is unclear in some
cases whether this represents the absence of pediatric cases or a
study design decision. Collectively, these papers represent some
900 cases of presumed or confirmed microbial keratitis, but we
cannot assume that cases of microbial keratitis did not occur in
younger children. Stapleton et al. state that daily disposable
contact lens wear ‘‘seems to be associated with the lowest risk of
severe microbial keratitis.’’21

 When age is considered as a potential risk factor for contact
lensYrelated microbial keratitis, data on young children are absent
and the results on the youngest age groupVusually 15 to 24
yearsVare equivocal. In a prospective, 12-month, population-based,
caseYcontrol study, Stapleton et al. identified 90 moderate and severe
cases related to daily wear of contact lenses and recruited 1090
community controls using daily wear contact lenses.20 Data on
frequency of case replacement were collected, but not frequency of
lens replacement or material. They found that wearer age (15Y24 vs.
25Y54 vs. 55Y64 years) was not associated with moderate and severe
disease. In a similar study, Lim et al. report 58 cases of contact lens
wearers presenting with microbial keratitis between 2008 and 2010
andrecruited152contemporaneouscontrols.23Eligiblecontactlens
wearers were individuals aged 14 to 67 years who had worn their
lenses in the 4 weeks before the event. They found that patients aged
between 25 and 44 years were at three times increased risk compared
with younger wearers (14Y24 years; 95% CI: 1.1Y9.6, P = .04).
Occasional overnightcontact lenswear(less often thanonenight per
week) was associated with a four times higher risk (95% CI:
1.2Y15.4, P = .03) compared with daily use. Lim et al. emphasize
that daily disposable lens wear was associated with a significantly
reduced risk of microbial keratitis, compared to weekly, fortnightly,
and monthly replacement (P G .001). Daily disposable lenses
accounted for only 10% of the cases, but 28% of the controls.
In a 1-year prospective study of 6245 overnight silicone hydrogel
(lotrafilcon A) lens wearers,15 Chalmers et al. found 159 symp-
tomatic corneal infiltrative events that were judged to be lens related
(2.5%) of which 10 were classified as microbial keratitis.13 The age
distribution is not described in detail but included subjects as young
as 5 years. None of the 10 cases of presumed microbial keratitis
occurred in patients under 18 years.15 Wearers who were at the
younger and older ends of the age distribution had a significantly
higherriskofdevelopinginfiltrates.Age G25years and 950yearswas
significantly associated with the development of corneal infiltrates
(G25 years OR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.24Y2.48 and 950 years OR = 2.04,
95% CI: 1.40Y2.98).
Chalmers et al. used similar methodology in a 1-year pro-
spective study of daily disposable soft lenses.12 Of the 977 patients
completing the 12-month survey, 13% were 15 years or younger.
Increasing patient age was significantly related to development of a
contact lensYrelated adverse event for the 11 cases with office visits
(odds ratio 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01Y1.10, P = .03). In other words, for
every year older, there was a 5% increase in the risk of a contact
lensYrelated adverse event requiring an office visit. The only adverse
event among the patients younger than 18 years was an allergic
conjunctivitis. Note that only two corneal infiltrative events occurred
in 960 patient years of daily disposable soft lens wear (489 years
silicone hydrogel and 471 years hydrogel)Van incidence of corneal
infiltrative events of 21 per 10,000 years. Although not stated in the
published paper, 202 children between 8 and 17 years were enrolled,
accounting for 171 patient years of wear and no infiltrates (Robin
Chalmers, personal communication).
These conflicting results may be attributable to variations in
event severity, definitions, material, wearing schedule, and study
setting, but there is no clear evidence of increased risk among 15- to
24-year-olds. The dogma in the literature is that the risk is higher in
younger patients,22butthe data fromtheabove studies conducted in
the past decade do not support this narrative. Regardless, most
studies use a broad range encompassing teenagers and college
students while ignoring younger children.
Hospital-Based Case Series of Microbial Keratitis in
Children
Serious corneal infections can occur in children wearing contact
lenses, even if not being particularly prominent in the above
well-conducted, large-scale, prospective epidemiological studies.
AlthoughreportsforEuropeandtheUSarescarce,thereareanumber
of hospital-based case series, all from Taiwan and Hong Kong, de-
scribing the characteristics of children presenting with microbial
keratitis over a 4- to 10-year period. Fong et al. conducted a retro-
spective 10-year study of microbial keratitis at National Taiwan
University Hospital, reporting 453 patients of whom only 22 were
15 years or younger (4.9%).24 Contact lens use accounted for 44%
of cases with pseudomonal keratitis, the most common pathogen.
The authors attribute this high proportion to the high prevalence of
myopia and the popularity of contact lens wear in Taiwan. No
details are provided regarding the ages of the pediatric cases, their
severity, nor the types of lenses worn.
Hsiao et al. reviewed the medical records of 78 children (e16
years) with microbial keratitis over a 4.5-year period at Chang Gung
Memorial Hospital, Taiwan.25 Contact lens wear was a factor in 33
of cases (41%), of which 8 (10%) were rigid gas permeable lenses
that were worn overnight for orthokeratology and 25 (31%) were
soft lenses. No data are provided on soft lens replacement schedule.
The mean visual acuity at resolution in the 25 soft lens wearers was
0.24 logMAR (20/35), but the proportion undergoing surgical
intervention is not given (15% of all 81 eyes) nor the number with
poorer than 20/40 visual acuity. Most of the 33 contact lens wearers
claimed they did not use correct disinfectant with their lenses or
wore the lenses overnight. Only one soft contact lensYrelated case of
microbial keratitis was under 12 years old, and the authors remark
that most Taiwanese children who start to wear soft contact lenses
are aged approximately 13 years.
In a follow-up study at the same hospital, Lee et al. reviewed the
medical records of 67 children aged 16 years or younger who were
diagnosed with and treated for microbial keratitis.26 Around half
the cases occurred in patients 11 years and under. The leading risk
factor was again contact lens use, accounting for a significantly
higher proportion of cases (53%) compared to the previous study.
This was entirely because of an increase in the number of cases
attributed to orthokeratology, which increased from 10 to 19% (P =
.011) likely reflecting higher numbers of orthokeratology wearers
rather any increase in the underlying risk. Soft contact lens wear still
accounted for a little over 30% of cases of microbial keratitis (34%),
but no data are given on soft lens replacement or wear schedule. The
patients with orthokeratology were significantly younger than those
with soft contact lens (11.9 years vs. 14.8 years, P G .001), but visual
acuity outcomes are not provided for either group. Pseudomonas
aeruginosa remained the most commonly isolated organism (31%).
Finally, Young et al. reported 18 patients G18 years of age with
microbial keratitis who presented over a 10-year period in Hong
Kong (mean age 12.4 years, range 3Y17 years).27 Contact lens
wear was the associated risk factor in 15 cases (83%), with 7 (39%)
associated with orthokeratology lenses and 8 (44%) associated with
soft lens wear including 1 user of colored contact lenses. Pseudomonas
640

 was the most commonly isolated organism (10 cases, 63%). The
authors provide details of all cases in a comprehensive table dem-
onstrating that among the eight cases in soft contact lens wearers, five
were biweekly or monthly replacement, and one each were extended
wear, daily wear, and cosmetic. Two soft lens wearers had final best-
corrected visual acuity worse than 20/40.
Although the above studies document that microbial keratitis
can occur in children wearing contact lenses in Asia, it is not possible
to estimate the frequency or incidence of these serious events. Like-
wise, few data are given on age distribution lens material or re-
placement schedule in these studies. Only Young et al.27 make any
referencetoreplacementscheduleand noneoftheircases wereindaily
disposable lenses.
Long-Term Prospective Studies of Contact Lenses in
Children
A number of prospective, large-scale clinical trials have followed
children wearing contact lenses over a study period of 2 to 3 years.
A pair of studies was conducted 20 years ago at Indiana University.
Terry et al. reported a 3-year study of changes in 10- to 13-year-old
children’s self-concepts after the replacement of their spectacles with
contact lenses.28 From a sample of 125 children who wore specta-
cles, 69 children were randomly designated to receive reusable
(CIBASoft; CIBA Vision, now Alcon, Fort Worth, TX) soft contact
lenses. Horner et al. reported a 3-year, randomized clinical trial of
myopia progression in 175 11- to 14-year-olds wearing reusable
(CIBASoft) soft contact lenses versus spectacles.29 Of those ran-
domized to contact lenses, 68 completed the 3-year trial. Unfor-
tunately, no data on safety or adverse events are reported in either of
the above publications.
Walline et al. randomly assigned 116 subjects aged 8 to 11 years
to wear rigid gas permeable or 2-week replacement soft contact
lenses (CIBA Focus 2; CIBA Vision, now Alcon, Fort Worth, TX)
in a 3-year clinical trial.30 Of the 57 randomized to soft lenses, 53
completedthetrialwearingsoftlenses.Nosubjects ineithertreatment
group experienced a sight-threatening adverse event. No infections
were reported, but four soft lens wearers experienced an adverse
eventVthree caused by ‘‘tight-fitting soft lenses’’ that resolved
completely after refitting with other brands. The other adverse event
was a result of a ‘‘contact lens solution allergy, which resolved after
changing the brand of solution.’’ Assuming these not to be corneal
infiltrative events, the 95% CI are 0 to 233 per 10,000 patient years.
No adverse events were reported among the rigid gas permeable lens
wearers.
Sankaridurg et al. reported comprehensive data on 240 children
aged 7 to 14 years enrolled in a prospective randomized clinical
trial of daily wear of monthly replacement, silicone hydrogel
lenses.31 Children were randomized to one commercial single-
vision design and three experimental lens designs aimed at reducing
myopiaprogressionVacentralzonetocorrectforthedistancerefractive
error and a peripheral optical zone that was relatively positive in power.
All were manufactured inlotrafilcon Bsilicone hydrogel(CIBAVision,
now Alcon, Fort Worth, TX) and worn bilaterally on a daily wear,
monthly replacement schedule. A total of 189 children completed 1
year of contact lens wear, and 170 children completed 2 years. There
were no events of microbial keratitis, although 55 non-serious adverse
events (annual incidence, 14.2%) were seen: contact lens papillary
conjunctivitis (16 events, 4.1%), superior epithelial arcuate lesions
(6 events, 1.5%), corneal erosions (8 events, 2.1%), infiltrative ker-
atitis (5 events, 1.3%), asymptomatic infiltrative keratitis (7 events,
1.8%), and asymptomatic infiltrates (13 events, 3.4%). The authors
conclude that adverse events with daily wear of silicone hydrogels in
children were mainly mechanical in nature, and significant infiltrative
events were few. Only the five cases of symptomatic infiltrative
keratitis would meet the definition of symptomatic corneal infil-
trative events used in other studies,13,14,22 representing an incidence
of corneal infiltrative events of 136 per 10,000 patient years (95%
CI = 50Y300).
In the largest clinical trial to date of contact lenses in children,
Walline et al. randomized 8- to 11-year-old myopic children at
five clinical centers in the United States.9,32 Of the 584 subjects,
237 were randomly assigned to wear spectacles and 247 to wear
daily disposable (1-Day Acuvue; Johnson & Johnson Vision Care,
Jacksonville, FL) or biweekly replacement (Acuvue 2; Johnson &
Johnson Vision Care) soft contact lenses. Daily disposable lenses
were fitted in 93% of children. At the end of the 3-year trial, 241
subjects were examined wearing contact lensesV224 originally
assigned to contact lenses and 17 assigned to spectacles. Nine
contact lens wearers (3.7%) experienced 13 adverse events, including
two cases of conjunctivitis (one bacterial and one viral), recurrent
phlyctenulosis, corneal dystrophy not noted at baseline, recurrent
anterioruveitis,sixcasesofkeratitisVfourattributedbytheauthorsto
‘‘poor compliance,’’ one to a ‘‘tight-fitting contact lens,’’ and one of
‘‘unknown etiology.’’ All adverse events completely resolved without
permanent decrease in best-corrected visual acuity. Although not
explicit,theimplicationisthatthereportedkeratitiswasnotmicrobial
or serious in nature and confirmed by personal communication from
the lead author. Regardless of the underlying assumptions and
assertions regarding ‘‘tight-fitting lenses’’ and ‘‘poor compliance,’’
the six cases of keratitis are assumed to be corneal infiltrative events
and represent an incidence of corneal infiltrative events of 83 per
10,000 patient years (95% CI = 34Y173).
Clinical Trials Where One or More Groups Wear Soft
Contact Lenses
In addition to the above studies, there have been a number of
reports of smaller samples wearing soft contact lenses in clinical
studies of myopia control. Unfortunately, only one of the six
studies reports safety data.
Anstice and Phillips fitted 40 children, 11 to 14 years old, with a
Dual-Focus soft contact lens in one eye and a single vision soft
contact lens in the other.2 The lenses were made of hioxifilcon A,
worn on a daily wear basis and replaced every 2 months. Subjects
were followed for 20 months. Six children dropped out because of
difficulties with handling contact lenses (n = 3), adverse publicity
regarding contact lenssolutions (n= 1), dislikeofcycloplegia(n= 1),
or contact lensYrelated discomfort (n = 1). Adverse events were
not reported.
Sankaridurg et al. fitted 45 Chinese children, aged 7 to 14 years,
with novel myopia-control, monthly replacement, silicone hydrogel
contact lenses and followed them for 12 months. They were com-
pared with a matched group (n = 40) wearing spectacles. No safety
data were reported.4

Optometry and Vision Science, Vol. 94, No. 6, June 2017
 Walline et al. fitted soft multifocal (Proclear Multifocal;
CooperVision, Victor, NY) contact lenses to forty 8- to 11-year-old
children, of whom 32 were examined after 1 year and 27 after
2 years.5 Lenses were replaced on a monthly basis and safety data
were not reported.
Lam et al. performed a 2-year double-masked randomized
clinical trial of soft contact lenses 221 children aged 8 to 13 years.3
Subjects were randomly assigned to a Defocus Incorporated Soft
Contact(DISC) lens(n=111)orsingle-visioncontactlenses(n=110).
The DISC lenses incorporated concentric rings that provided +2.50D
of addition power, alternating with the normal distance correction.
The lenses were replaced every 6 months. Only 128 children (58%)
completed the 2-yearstudy (DISC, n = 65; single vision, n = 63). No
safety data were reported, although the authors state that ‘‘adverse
reactions were low’’ and that ‘‘17 excluded due to ocular health
problems.’’
Cheng et al. randomized 127 subjects (8Y11 years) to either soft
contact lenses with positive spherical aberration or a spherical
control lens, both made of the same material (etafilcon A with
Lacreon technology).33 During this treatment phase, subjects were
followed for up to 2 years, with 109 completing at least 1 year of
follow-up. Thereafter, 82 subjects participated in a withdrawal
phase wherein all wore 1-Day Acuvue Moist soft contact lenses
with 77 completing 18 months of follow-up. No cases of microbial
keratitis or corneal infiltrative events were reported, although
there were two instances of contact dermatitis and four of allergic
conjunctivitis.
Aller et al. randomized 79 myopic subjects (8Y18 years) to either
single-vision (Vistakon Acuvue 2) soft contact lenses or bifocal
(Acuvue Bifocal; Johnson & Johnson Vision Care) soft contact
lenses worn on a daily wear basis for 12 months, with a 2-week
replacement schedule.1 Of these, 78 completed the 1-year clinical
trial. No safety data were reported.
Prospective Studies of Fitting Children and Teenagers
There have also been a handful of short-term studies published,
demonstrating the feasibility of fitting children as young as 8 years
with softcontact lenses. Althoughlimitedinduration,theyall report
data on adverse events.
The Contact Lenses in Pediatrics (CLIP) Study compared
contact lens fitting and follow-up between 8- to 12-year-old
children and 13- to 17-year-old teenagers.34 The study enrolled
84 children and 85 teens and fit them with soft contact lenses
(Acuvue Advance with Hydraclear or Acuvue Advance for Astig-
matism; Johnson & Johnson Vision Care), presumably on a 2-week
replacement schedule. All but 12 completed the 3-month study
(86%) and no serious adverse events were observed, but ‘‘three cases
of viral keratitis and two cases of suspected contact lens overwear’’
were reported. The authors’ Table 4 indicates one episode of a corneal
infiltrate, although the severity is unclear.
In a similar study in Singapore, Li et al. recruited and fitted
59 children (8Y11 years) with spherical or toric daily disposable soft
lenses.35 Of the 59 subjects enrolled, 53 (90%) completed the study
successfully. Six subjects discontinued due to lens handling
difficulties (n = 4), unacceptable lens fit (n = 1), and an adverse event
(n = 1). Adverse events were reported in three subjects, including the
discontinuation, all because of a chalazion.
Plowright et al. randomized subjects (aged 13Y19 years) with no
previouscontact lenswearexperienceto daily disposable softcontact
lenses or spectacles for 6 months.8 A total of 110 teenagers were
enrolled; 13 discontinued before study completion, 10 from the
contact lens group and 3 from the spectacle group (P = .04). No
serious adverse events occurred during the study, although a
19-year-old discontinued the study at month 3 because of a
contact lensYinduced peripheral ulcer (CLPU) and subsequent
topical medication (chloramphenicol).The CLPUwas resolvedata
follow-up visit 21 days later leaving a small peripheral scar.
Paquette et al. recruited 179 children aged 8 to 16 years without
previous soft contact lens experience and fitted them with soft
contact lenses.36 Of those recruited, 90.5% (162/179) were suc-
cessfully fitted and completed the 3-month study. No serious adverse
events occurred, although five subjects presented with non-clinically
relevant corneal staining, one participant presented with a corneal
infiltrate, and one participant presented with a lens care reaction. The
corneal infiltrate self-resolved within 1 week with the participant later
resuming lens wear.
Although not a prospective study, Turnbull et al. reported a case
series of 110 patients of whom 32 were prescribed dual focus soft
contact lenses for myopia control (mean age: 11.4 T 2.4 years).37
Over a mean follow-up of 1.33 T 0.80 years for these soft lens wearers,
no adverse events were observed.
Large-Scale Retrospective Studies of SafetyVThe
CLAY Study
The Contact Lens Assessment in Youth (CLAY) Study was a
multicenter, retrospective, observational study to evaluate the risk
factors that interrupt soft contact lens wear among children,
teenagers,andyoungadultsinNorthAmerica.Thegoalwastoassess
the safety profile of soft contact lens wear in a pediatric population
outside the confines of prospective clinical studies. The cohort
represented patients presenting to academic eye care clinics for
routine and problem-oriented eye care and included both habitual
and newly prescribed soft contact lens wearers.
Lam et al. described the methodology, including the important
over-sampling of youngest age to make statistical comparisons, the
demographics, and clinical characteristics of this cohort at the first
observed visit.38 Charts from 3,549 patients (14,276 visits) were
reviewed; 79% were existing soft contact lens wearers and 21%
were new fits. The age distribution was 8 to e13 years (n = 260,
7%), 13 to e18 years (n = 879, 25%), 18 to e26 years (n = 1274,
36%), and 26 to e34 years (n = 1136, 32%). Seventy-seven
percent of current soft contact lens wearers had a documented
replacement schedule. Based on patient-reported replacement
schedules, daily replacement composed the smallest percentage
(9.9%) across all age groups, although this mode was most common
(15.8%) among the youngest soft contact lens wearers (8Y12 years).
Monthly and 1- to 2-week replacement each accounted for 39% in
the overall population. Microbial keratitis and other adverse events
are not reported in this first publication.
In a subsequent report, Chalmers et al. reported the frequency
of corneal infiltrative events (microbial keratitis, CLARE with and
without infiltrates, CLPU, and infiltrative keratitis) in the afore-
mentioned sample from 14,305 visits observing 4,663 soft contact

 in 1,054 patients under the age of 18 years.14 Reviewers masked to
wearer identity, age, and soft contact lens parameters adjudicated
event diagnoses. The chart review yielded 187 corneal infiltrative
events in 168 wearers: 8 instances of microbial keratitis, 110 of
infiltrative keratitis, 41 CLPUs, 14 CLARE with infiltrates, 13
CLARE without infiltrates, and 1 iritis. Age was a significant nonlinear
risk factor, peaking between 15 and 25 years (P = .008). The risk of a
corneal infiltrative event increased in a nonlinear fashion up to
age 21 and then decreased similarly, with the peak years at risk
from age 15 to 25 years. Fig. 2 replots the published data in terms
of incidence (cases per 10,000 patient years of wear) based on the
number of cases and duration of follow-up reported by the authors.
Note that all incidence rates have confidence intervals and those for
all corneal infiltrative events are given below. The figure demon-
strates the marked lower rate of corneal infiltrative events in patients
8 to 12 years old (97 per 10,000 patient years, 95% CI = 31Y235)
than in patients 13 to 17 years old (335 per 10,000 patient years,
95% CI = 248Y443). No cases of microbial keratitis occurred in
the 8- to 12-year-olds and two occurred in the 13- to 17-year-olds
representing an incidence of microbial keratitis events of 15 per
10,000 patient years (95% CI = 2Y48) in the latter age group,
substantially lower than the incidence for all corneal infiltrative
events. In addition to patient age, years of contact lens wear, use of
a multipurpose lens care system, overnight wear, and use of silicone
hydrogel lenses (in decreasing order) were all significant risk factors.
Wagner et al. subsequently reported that the risk of interrup-
tion to soft contact lens wear followed the same pattern as corneal
infiltrative events, increasing from ages 8 to 18 years, showing
modest increases between ages 19 and 25 years, and then declining
after age 25 years.39 New lens wearers (e1 year) were less likely to
experience interrupting events (P G .001).
The CLAY Study Group has subsequently begun to investigate
the underlying behavioral, biological, or environmental factors
that may potentially drive the above age-related complications.
They developed a Contact Lens Risk Survey to assess known or
presumed risk factors for soft contact lens complications and
administered the survey to a nonclinical population of 542 soft
contact lens wearers aged 12 to 33 years.39 Wearers aged 18 to
21 years reported more recent nights with less than 6 hours of
sleep (P G .001), more colds/flu (P = .049), and higher stress
levels (P G .001). Wearers 18 to 21 and 22 to 25 years were
more likely to wear soft contact lenses when showering (P G
.001) and also reported more frequent naps with soft contact
lenses (P G .001). The 18- to 25-year age group were more likely to
report sleeping in SCLs after alcohol use (P = .031), when traveling
(P = .001), and when away from home (P = .024).
Finally, the researchers investigated whether the surveyed risk
factors were correlated with their previously established age-
related risk profile for corneal infiltrative events (Fig. 2).40 To
match the known age-related riskprofile, a distribution should show
a rise in behaviors from 12- to 17-year-olds, peaking among 18- to
25-year-olds, and declining in 26- to33-year-olds.Visualinspection
showed good agreement between the age-related risk curve
(Fig. 2) and age-binned survey responses for various behaviors,
e.g., showering and napping in soft contact lenses. The rate of
all-risky behaviors was around twice as high in 18- to 21-year-
olds compared to the 12- to 14-year-olds. Although the presence of
risky soft contact lens wearing behaviors does not imply a causal

SUMMARY
The publications reviewed above encompass a wide range of
study goals. Studies were designed to evaluate the influence of a
lens design on myopia progression, the effects of contact lenses on
self-esteem, the ease of fitting and adaptation to wear, the safety of
contact lens wear, or some combination.
Table 1 summarizes most of the prospective studies cited above.
In those representing at least 100 patient years of lens wear, the
incidence of corneal infiltrative events and the 95% confidence
intervals can be estimated based on the number of events reported,
the number of patients completing the study, and the duration of
follow-up. For the three large clinical trials, the incidence of
corneal infiltrative events for children wearing contact lenses is up
to 136 per 10,000 years with upper 95% confidence intervals of
up to 300 per 10,000 years.30Y32 Where specified by the authors,31
only symptomatic infiltrates are included in Table 1. There are
additional asymptomatic events and non-infiltrative presentations
observed at the many scheduled visits in prospective studies. The
clinical significance of these may be unclear, but they cannot be
captured easily with retrospective study designs.41
The largest of these numbers reflects the wearing of reusable
silicone hydrogel lenses and includes subjects as old as 14 years.31
The estimate of corneal infiltrative events of 83 per 10,000 years
for Walline et al.32 is probably high because it assumes their six
cases of lens-related keratitis to be corneal infiltrative events, al-
though the authors make no mention of the presence or absence
of corneal infiltrates. Thus, the incidence may be much lower. The
incidence for the CLAY study is also calculated for two age groups
based on their published data.14 The incidence of corneal infil-
trative events for the three studies enrolling 8- to 11-year-olds30,32
or 7- to 14-year-olds31 agree well with the estimate for 8- to 12-
year-olds from the CLAY study (0, 83, and 136 per 10,000 years
vs. 97 per 10,000 years).14 Their incidence of corneal infiltrative
events falls within the range for the three prospective studies and
the upper 95% confidence intervals all fall between 173 and 300
per 10,000 years.
The summary of the incidence of corneal infiltrative events in
Table 1 can be placed in the context of epidemiological studies of
adult contact lens wearers (some described above, some not be-
cause they did not include patients under 18 years of age). In the
last decade, the annualized incidence of symptomatic corneal
infiltrative events in adults has been reported as follows:
&
318 per 10,000 patient years in patients attempting 30-night
continuous wear of silicone hydrogel lenses13;
&
340 per 10,000 patient years for extended wear low Dk hydrogel
lenses and 720 per 10,000 patient years for extended wear
silicone hydrogel lenses based on a meta-analysis42;
&
432 per 10,000 patient years in a retrospective chart review of
mostly daily wear14; and

316 per 10,000 patient years in a prospective study for daily
wear of silicone hydrogel lenses with monthly replacement.43
&
2,061 per 10,000 patient years in multiple 3-month trials of
various daily wear silicone hydrogel contact lens and lens solution
combinations.44
Note that these estimates are for symptomatic corneal infil-
trative events and not microbial keratitis, and values have been
recalculated from the data presented in each paper except the
meta-analysis.42 The incidence of corneal infiltrative events in the
last of the above studies44 is almost three times that of any others.
This is likely caused by the more frequent and rigorous exami-
nation schedule and that 62% of the corneal infiltrative events
(almost exclusively classified as infiltrative keratitis) were associated
with one of four contact lens solutions studied. In the remaining
studies, the incidence of corneal infiltrative events varies depending
on wearing schedule, replacement schedule, study design, and set-
ting, but the range covers only a factor of twoVfrom 318 to 720 per
10,000 patient years, even though the list includes both daily wear
and extended wear. By comparison, Table 1 demonstrates that for
the three prospective studies in children, the incidence of corneal
infiltrativeeventsissubstantiallylower(upto136per10,000patient
years).30Y32 The 95% confidence intervals are broad because of the
size of the cohorts, but the upper limits are no higher than 300 per
10,000 patient years. Thus, it seems reasonable to conclude that the
risk of corneal infiltrative events in children wearing soft contact
lenses is no higher than in adults and if anything may be markedly
lower. Furthermore, the incidence of corneal infiltrative events is
particularly low when the population is limited to children 12 years
and younger.14,30,32 Indeed, the 95% confidence intervals for the
two age groups in the CLAY study do not overlap (Table 1).14
Microbial keratitis in soft contact lens wearers is rare regardless
of the age of the population, with sleeping in lenses a significant
risk factor.21 None of the nine prospective studies documenting
soft contact lens wear in children that include safety outcomes
described in detail above and summarized in Table 1 encountered
a single case of microbial keratitis. Collectively, these studies
represent 1800 patient years of wear in 7- to 19-year-olds. The five
clinical studies where safety data are not reported constitute a
further 493 patient years. The only study that allows an estimate of
the incidence of microbial keratitis in children wearing contact
lenses found no cases of microbial keratitis occurred in 8- to 12-
year-olds and an incidence of 15 per 10,000 patient years (95% CI =
2Y48) in 13- to 17-year-olds.14 Despite there being no cases in the
younger age group, the upper 95% confidence interval may be
estimated as 90 per 10,000 patient years, higher than that for the
13- to17-year-olds. The majorityofthe reportedcases are attributed
to sleeping in lenses, and the incidence is no higher than the inci-
dence of microbial keratitis in adults wearing contact lenses on an
overnight basis.13,21
In conclusion, it is possible to make a valid assessment of the
safety of soft contact lenses in children by assembling data from a
number of different studies. The retrospective data from the
CLAY study documents 1783 patient years of wear in 8- to 17-
year-olds. The prospective studies where safety outcomes are
reported collectively represent a further 1800 patient years of wear
in 7- to 19-year-olds. The overall picture is that the incidence of
corneal infiltrative events in children is no higher than in adults,
and in the youngest age range of 8 to 11 years, it may be markedly
lower. The lower rate of adverse events in this youngest group is a
result of patient behavior rather than biological factors, and greater
parental supervision may also help to mitigate risks.40
Finally, the introduction of daily disposable soft contact lenses
may play a role in reducing corneal infiltrative events in all patients,
including children. Walline et al. fitted 93% of their 247 patients in
daily disposable soft lenses and reported no cases of microbial
keratitis and an incidence of corneal infiltrative events that is 83 per
10,000patient years at most, and probably much lower.32 Similarly,
Chalmers et al. reported no cases of microbial keratitis and only two
corneal infiltrative events occurred in 960 years of daily disposable
soft lens wear in patients aged between 8 and 76 years, representing
an incidence of 21 per 10,000 years.12
LIMITATIONS
This review includes a wide range of studies with a variety of
specific aims, although most of the larger studies are prospective
with well-characterized cohorts. Nonetheless, the complication rate
for subjects enrolled in a scientific endeavor may not reflect the rate
in clinical practice, although the available retrospective data do show
very similar rates. Selection bias may occur, with children perceived
to be at higher risk not being recruited or fit with contact lenses as
enthusiastically by cautious clinical investigators and practitioners
alike. The estimates of incidence are crude and make a number of
assumptions including that risk is constant over time. This may not
be the case given reports that events occur more often after the first
year of contact lens wear.39,45 A further limitation is that studies of
myopia control focus of the effectiveness of the study treatment and
only one of the six summarized above reports safety outcomes
leading to the possibility of underreporting. For future clinical trials
of myopia control in children, authors should rigorously classify and
report adverse events and avoid editorial comments about patient
compliance and lens fit. If an event happens, it should be reported
without attribution. Among the studies summarized here, loss to
follow-up is as high as 42%,3 representing a further sourceof bias. In
contrast, Walline et al. limited loss to follow-up to less than 4%
in their 3-year clinical trial.9 As studies of all types of contact
lenses in children proliferate, it would be useful for authors to sum-
marize all and any adverse events, preferably using a standardized
set of diagnosessuchasthoseusedbyChalmersetal.14orSankaridurg
et al.31 Additional robust safety data are needed for children wearing
contact lenses. Industry, academia, and the broader contact lens
community can engage in this endeavor as new myopia control
modalities are evaluated. Likewise, efforts should be undertaken to
include children in future epidemiologic research.
