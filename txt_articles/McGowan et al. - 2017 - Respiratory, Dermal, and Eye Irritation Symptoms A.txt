BACKGROUND: The large quantities of chemical oil dispersants used in the oil spill response and cleanup (OSRC) work following the Deepwater
Horizon disaster provide an opportunity to study associations between dispersant exposure (Corexit™ EC9500A or EC9527A) and human health.
OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to examine associations between potential exposure to the dispersants and adverse respiratory, dermal, and eye irri-
tation symptoms.
METHODS: Using data from detailed Gulf Long-term Follow-up ( GuLF) Study enrollment interviews, we determined potential exposure to either dis-
persant from participant-reported tasks during the OSRC work. Between 27,659 and 29,468 participants provided information on respiratory, dermal,
and eye irritation health. We estimated prevalence ratios (PRs) to measure associations with symptoms reported during the OSRC work and at study
enrollment, adjusting for potential confounders including airborne total hydrocarbons exposure, use of cleaning chemicals, and participant demographics.
RESULTS: Potential exposure to either of the dispersants was significantly associated with all health outcomes at the time of the OSRC, with the
strongest association for burning in the nose, throat, or lungs [adjusted PR ðaPRÞ = 1:61 (95% CI: 1.42, 1.82)], tightness in chest [aPR = 1:58 (95%
CI: 1.37, 1.81)], and burning eyes [aPR = 1:48 (95% CI: 1.35, 1.64). Weaker, but still significant, associations were found between dispersant expo-
sure and symptoms present at enrollment.
CONCLUSIONS: Potential exposure to Corexit™ EC9527A or EC9500A was associated with a range of health symptoms at the time of the OSRC, as
well as at the time of study enrollment, 1–3 y after the spill. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1677
Introduction
Background
Over 4:9 million barrels of crude oil was released into the Gulf of
Mexico between the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig on
20 April 2010 and the top-capping of the wellhead on 15 July
2010 (United States Coast Guard 2011). As part of the oil spill
response and cleanup (OSRC), approximately 1:8 million gallons
(6:8 million liters) of oil dispersant was applied both to the sea
surface [1:07 million gallons (4:05 million liters)] and directly
into the stream of oil leaving the wellhead 5,000 feet (1:5 km)
underwater [0:77 million gallons
(2:9 million liters)] (United
States Coast Guard 2011). Dispersants are typically used to
reduce the interfacial tension between crude oil and water and
facilitate the breakup of oil slicks into small droplets that are
thought to be more easily dispersed by natural processes such as
wind and wave action (Chapman et al. 2007). Two dispersants
were used in the Deepwater Horizon spill response: Corexit™
EC9500A (9500A), which was applied at both the water surface
and the subsurface wellhead, and Corexit™ EC9527A (9527A),
which was applied only at the water surface (Kujawinski et al.
2011). Both dispersants are composed of propylene glycol and or-
ganic salts including dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DOSS).
Additionally, 9500A contains petroleum distillates, whereas 9527A
does not contain petroleum distillates but does contain 2-butoxye-
thanol (Wise and Wise 2011).
Dispersants were applied to the surface either through aerial
spraying or by vessels within 3 nautical miles (5:5 km) of the
wellhead area. Aerial application consisted of both 9527A and
9500A from 22 April until 22 May, after which 9500A was used
exclusively. Vessels in the wellhead area applied 9500A exclusively
(BP Gulf Science Data 2016a). Subsurface application of 9500A
was accomplished through a remotely operated underwater vehicle
injecting dispersant directly into the stream of oil leaving the well-
head (BP Gulf Science Data 2016b). Based on these uses, the most
likely avenues for human exposure among responders are from der-
mal exposure and from inhalation of dispersant aerosol droplets.
Previous epidemiologic studies have found adverse health
effects associated with oil spill cleanup work (Aguilera et al.
2010; Laffon et al. 2016). Effects have included increased lumbar
pain, migraine, dermatitis, eye and throat irritation, and respira-
tory symptoms. Most epidemiologic studies have focused on the
acute effects of crude oil exposure during spill cleanup, although
Zock et al. (2012) found an association between participating in
cleanup work and self-reported respiratory symptoms 5 y after
the spill response in workers who responded to the Prestige oil
spill in 2002. Although dispersants were used in some of these
previous OSRC operations, no studies looked at distinguishing
effects of exposure to the dispersants.
In contrast, much of the research on dispersants has focused
on their efficacy in dispersing oil (Prince et al. 2013) and on
potential adverse impacts on the environment (Kleindienst et al.

Research
 2015). Wise and Wise (2011) published a review of studies
examining the toxicity of various dispersants, including 9500A
and 9527A, in certain model species, finding that both dispersants
exhibited similar acute toxicity to crustaceans and mollusks and
that oral exposure to 9527A adversely affected intestinal function
in rat models.
In response to public concerns regarding the use of disper-
sants during the OSRC, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) commissioned a series of trials testing the acute
toxicity of eight oil dispersants in representative Gulf species,
classifying 9500A as either “slightly toxic” or “practically non-
toxic” depending on the species (Hemmer et al. 2010a).
Similarly, dispersant–oil mixtures were reported to be no more
toxic to those Gulf species than crude oil alone (Hemmer et al.
2010b). However, the U.S. EPA did not investigate the effects of
exposure to 9527A. Since the spill, additional research has shown
that dermal exposure to 9500A resulted in dermal irritation and
sensitization in mice (Anderson et al. 2011), although a 5-h inha-
lation exposure to 9500A did not appear to result in significant
adverse pulmonary symptoms in rats (Roberts et al. 2011).
However, these studies of mice and rats did not include a coexpo-
sure of crude oil or other petroleum by-products that would be
expected to be present in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill
environment.
Using in vitro cultures of human bronchial cells, Shi et al.
(2013) showed that exposure to either 9500A or 9527A resulted
in a significant loss of cell viability and that the loss of viability
was dose-dependent. Similarly, Major et al. (2016) found that
exposing human bronchial cells to individual mixtures of 9500A
and 9527A with crude oil induced both cytotoxic and genotoxic
effects. Although data on toxicity of dispersants are limited, there
is some evidence of effects caused by the component ingredients
of each dispersant. Human exposure studies have shown that pro-
pylene glycol is a mild irritant when applied dermally, and animal
studies of respiratory effects due to inhalation exposure are incon-
clusive (ATSDR 1997). In contrast, 2-butoxyethanol is consider-
ably more toxic, with acute respiratory effects and eye irritation
observed in both human and animal studies, although minimal
dermal effects have been observed in human studies (ATSDR
1998). The Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for DOSS lists
the chemical as irritating to the skin and eyes and as a possible re-
spiratory irritant (Acros Organics 2013). We were unable to find
any studies of direct effects of either 9500A or 9527A on human
health.
Given the lack of epidemiologic research into the effects of
dispersant exposure on human health, our study used data from a
large cohort of workers participating in the Deepwater Horizon
OSRC to assess two related objectives. The first objective was to
quantify associations of potential exposure to dispersants with
adverse respiratory, eye irritation, and dermal effects at the time
of the OSRC; the second objective was to quantify associations
of potential exposure to dispersants with adverse respiratory, eye
irritation, and dermal effects in the 30 days before study enroll-
ment, 1–3 years after the OSRC.
Methods
Study Design
Data were from the Gulf Long-term Follow-up Study (GuLF
STUDY), a prospective cohort study of persons involved in the
OSRC following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill (Kwok
et al. 2017). Briefly, a total of 32,608 participants completed a
telephone interview to enroll in the study between March 2011
and March 2013. This detailed interview collected information
on particulars of the participant’s OSRC work, if any, in addition
to demographic factors, lifestyle information, and medical his-
tory/symptoms both at the time of the OSRC and at the time of
the interview. The interview for Vietnamese-speaking participants
was abbreviated and did not collect information that could be used
to assess potential dispersant exposure; therefore, those partici-
pants (n = 999) were excluded from this analysis. Additionally, we
excluded any remaining participants with missing data on the ex-
posure of interest, on the outcomes of interest, or on covariates,
leaving study populations of 28,636 for analyses of respiratory
outcomes, 27,659 for dermal outcomes, and 29,468 for eye irrita-
tion outcomes. The study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of the National Institute of Environmental Health
Sciences/National Institutes of Health. After receiving information
about the study in the mail, participants provided verbal consent
for the enrollment telephone interview.
Exposure Assessment
Participants were categorized as workers if they worked at least
one day engaged in OSRC activities. Nonworkers received safety
training but never worked on the response. For respiratory and
eye irritation analyses, dispersant exposure for workers was clas-
sified as “ever/never” based on a positive response to any inter-
view question asking about direct work with dispersants or work
on a ship from which dispersants were applied (see Table S1).
Additionally, participants were classified as exposed if they
responded positively to working on any task that involved
dispersant-related equipment, such as pumps, for more than half
of the time. For dermal analyses, dermal dispersant exposure for
workers was classified as “ever/never” based on self-reported
skin or clothing contact with dispersants during the OSRC for
breaking up the oil on or below the surface of the water.
Although the questionnaire did not specifically refer to either
Corexit™ 9527A or Corexit™ 9500A by name, these were the
only oil dispersants used during the OSRC, and it is therefore rea-
sonable to consider reported exposure to dispersants as reported
exposure to either Corexit™ 9527A or Corexit™ 9500A. Office
workers, workers who said no to all dispersant-related questions,
and those who received safety training but did not work on the
OSRC were assumed to be unexposed and were categorized as
such for all analyses.
Using publicly available data on dates and locations of use of
specific dispersants in the spill response (BP Gulf Science Data
2016a, 2016b), we categorized exposed participants as potentially
exposed to 9500A only or as potentially additionally exposed to
9527A. Because 9527A was used in aerial applications only prior
to 22 May 2010, we categorized participants who reported work-
ing on the relevant tasks during that period as potentially exposed
to 9527A. Those who only worked on spraying dispersant from
vessels or pumping dispersant to the wellhead and those who
only reported working with dispersants after 22 May were classi-
fied as potentially exposed to 9500A only.
Additionally, among those classified as exposed in the respi-
ratory and eye irritation analyses, participants were classified as
directly working with dispersants if they had a positive response
to any questionnaire item related to personally working with dis-
persants (see Table S1). Any participant who reported a positive
response to a question about dispersant exposures but did not
report this direct exposure was categorized as indirectly working
with dispersants.
Outcome Assessment
Outcomes were based on participant responses to questions on
the enrollment interview about the frequency of symptoms at the
time of the OSRC or at the time of the enrollment interview.
Environmental Health Perspectives
097015-2
 Participants reported the frequency of symptoms on an ordinal
scale: “never,” “rarely,” “sometimes,” “most of the time,” or “all
of the time,” and a symptom was considered present (yes vs. no)
if the response was “most of the time” or “all of the time.” Five
distinct respiratory symptoms (cough, wheeze, tightness in chest,
shortness of breath, burning in nose/throat/lungs), one dermal
symptom (≥2 d of eczema, dermatitis, other skin rashes, sores, or
blisters), and two eye irritation symptoms (itchy eyes, burning
eyes) were assessed.
Potential Confounders
We considered a variety of potential confounders. Demographic
data including age, race, gender, and education level, as well as
smoking status, employment status, financial worry, preexisting
lung conditions, potential exposure to equipment decontamina-
tion chemicals and skin/clothing contact with oil or decontamina-
tion chemicals were assessed from responses on the enrollment
interview. Residential proximity to the spill site was categorized
based on the proximity of the county of residence to the Gulf [ad-
jacent to the Gulf Coast, counties one county inland from the
Gulf coast, other Gulf state (AL, FL, LA, MS, TX) counties, or
non–Gulf state counties]. Approximate maximum daily time-
weighted average airborne level of total hydrocarbons (THC) ex-
posure over all OSRC tasks was estimated using an ordinal job
exposure matrix (Kwok et al. 2017; Stewart et al. in press).
Perceived stress was assessed using Cohen’s Perceived Stress
Scale (Cohen et al. 1983).
Statistical Analyses
Owing to the cross-sectional nature of the data and the moder-
ately high prevalence of the outcomes of interest among the study
population (Table 1), we calculated adjusted prevalence ratios
(aPRs) as the measure of effect rather than odds ratios because of
ease of interpretation (Thompson et al. 1998). We fit multivari-
able log-binomial regression models to directly estimate the PR
for each outcome in the exposed group compared with the unex-
posed group. Models were adjusted for a variety of a priori
potential confounders depending on the outcome of interest. All
models were adjusted for age at enrollment (<30, 30–45, >45),
race (white, black, or other), gender, and education level
(>high school degree or not). Models of dermal symptoms were
also adjusted for skin or clothing contact with oil or tar (yes/no)
and skin or clothing contact with equipment decontamination
chemicals (yes/no). Models of both eye irritation and respiratory
symptoms were also adjusted for residential proximity to the spill
site, smoking status (never smoker, former smoker, light current
smoker, or heavy current smoker), potential exposure to equip-
ment decontamination chemicals (yes/no), and the maximum esti-
mated airborne level of THC exposure (<0:3 ppm, 0:3–0:99 ppm,
1:00–2:99 ppm, ≥3:00 ppm) across all OSRC work. Models for
respiratory symptoms were further adjusted for the presence of
self-reported preexisting lung conditions (yes/no). All models of
symptoms at the time of enrollment were further adjusted for
employment status (employed, unemployed, disabled, retired), fi-
nancial worry (yes/no), and Cohen’s Perceived Stress Scale (0–5,
6–10, ≥11) at enrollment.
Because nonconvergence can be an issue with log-binomial
regression owing to the model’s restricted parameter space, we
used the weighted COPY method outlined by Deddens and
Petersen (2008) to approximate the maximum likelihood esti-
mates and related standard errors for any models that did not ini-
tially converge, using 1,000,000 virtual copies of the data set. All
analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute
Inc.). We used a significance level of p < 0:05 for all analyses.
Sensitivity/Secondary Analyses
Because these data are self-reported, there is a potential for recall
and reporting bias to influence the participant’s reporting of
symptoms. We used self-reported excessive hair loss at the time
of the OSRC or in the 30 d before enrollment to identify partici-
pants who may have over-reported their symptoms because there
is no known biological mechanism that would relate dispersant
exposure to excessive hair loss. All analyses were repeated after
restricting the study populations to those without self-reported
excessive hair loss at the time point of interest (i.e., symptoms
during the spill or within 30 d of enrollment) to help assess any
potential impact of reporting bias on the results.
Some nonworkers who completed safety training but were not
hired to work on the OSRC may have had preexisting health con-
ditions or other factors (such as obesity) that either prevented
them from working or made them less attractive to contractors
charged with staffing the cleanup effort. As such, having them as
a part of the comparison group in the analyses could result in
biased estimates in comparison with an analysis comparing
exposed workers with unexposed workers. To help assess any
impact of such a potential healthy-worker selection effect, we
repeated all analyses with nonworkers excluded from the
analysis.
Because some participants who worked on land reported
working directly with dispersants, there was concern that partici-
pants may have confused dispersants with chemicals used to
clean and decontaminate equipment because these chemicals
were used to “disperse” the oil from the equipment. Therefore,
we conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding any respondents
whose only exposure was reported handling of dispersants on
land who also reported active participation in equipment decon-
tamination activities. We also conducted sensitivity analyses
excluding exposed workers who reported being exposed outside
the known dates of dispersant use; furthermore, we performed
sensitivity analyses assessing potential confounding resulting
from relevant personal protective equipment (PPE) use during
the OSRC (i.e., respirators/facemasks for respiratory symptoms,
rubber gloves or coveralls for dermal symptoms). We also
assessed potential effect measure modification by PPE (i.e., respi-
rator or face mask) use among respiratory outcomes. More than
97% of those reporting dermal exposure also reported the use of
PPE (i.e., gloves, protective clothing); therefore, there was insuf-
ficient heterogeneity to investigate potential effect modification
of dispersant contact by this variable (Table 1). In the question-
naire, we did not ascertain whether PPE was worn during specific
tasks, so here, we used overall PPE use as a proxy.
Among OSRC workers, models of respiratory and eye irrita-
tion were stratified based on three mutually exclusive worker
locations—ever worked on the water in the area of the wellhead,
ever worked on the water but not near the wellhead, or worked
only on land—to capture potential environmental differences
between the locations. For example, workers near the wellhead
area would likely have been exposed to increased particulate mat-
ter from the flaring of oil/gas by two vessels in the wellhead area.
For models of symptoms within 30 d of enrollment, participants
were also stratified by the reported presence/absence of the symp-
tom of interest at the time of the spill in order to investigate per-
sistence across time points.
Given that those exposed to dispersants largely worked in areas
where they might have also had exposure to THC, we investigated
potential effect modification of the dispersant by the estimated
maximum airborne level of THC (<0:3 ppm, 0:3–0:99 ppm,
1:0–2:99 ppm, and ≥3:0 ppm) over all OSRC jobs. We also inves-
tigated potential effect modification by exposure to decontamina-
tion chemicals. Because 97% of those reporting skin/clothing

097015-3
 contact with dispersants also reported skin/clothing contact with
oil/tar (Table 1), there was insufficient heterogeneity to investigate
whether oil/tar contact modified the effect of dispersant contact.
Results
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of participants in each
analytic study population. Approximately 7.6% of participants
included in the respiratory symptom and eye irritation analyses
were considered exposed to dispersants. Among those included
in the analysis of dermal symptoms, 3.8% had direct skin or
clothing contact with dispersants.
The study population was overwhelmingly male; approxi-
mately 80% of the unexposed were men as were ∼ 90% of the
exposed. Those exposed to dispersants were more likely to be
nonwhite, less likely to have any education beyond high school,
and more likely to be <45 y old compared with those who were
unexposed. For the respiratory and eye irritation analyses, those
exposed were more likely to be current smokers (39% vs. 29%
for the unexposed) and live in Gulf Coast counties. Given where
dispersants were used during the OSRC, it is unsurprising that
those exposed to dispersants were more likely to have also been
exposed to levels of airborne THC >3:0 ppm (ppm) (53% vs. 7%)
and to have worked with equipment decontamination chemicals
(74% vs. 19%). Among those included in the respiratory analyses,
there was no difference in the prevalence of preexisting lung con-
ditions between the exposed and unexposed groups. For the der-
mal analyses, those exposed to dispersants were substantially
more likely to have also come into contact with oil or tar (97%
vs. 31% for the unexposed group) as well as more likely to have
come into contact with equipment decontamination chemicals
(60% vs. 5%).

 respiratory symptom reported at the time of the OSRC (cough,
wheeze, shortness of breath, tightness in the chest, and burning in
the nose, throat, or lungs) was significantly higher in the exposed
group than in the unexposed group, with aPRs ranging from 1.36
[95% confidence interval (CI): 1.23, 1.52] for wheeze to 1.61
(95% CI: 1.42, 1.83) for burning in the nose, throat, or lungs.
Similarly, the adjusted prevalences at the time of the OSRC for
burning in the eyes and for itching in the eyes, as well as the
adjusted prevalence for ≥2 d of itching or dermatitis, were signif-
icantly higher in the exposed group than in the unexposed group.
Direct exposure to dispersants was more strongly associated with
each respiratory and eye irritation outcome at the time of the
OSRC than was indirect exposure, with nonoverlapping confi-
dence intervals for shortness of breath (Table 3).
For most symptoms at the time of the OSRC, aPRs were
higher for possible exposure to 9527A than for exposure to only
9500A, although the aPRs were not markedly different except for
tightness in the chest [aPR = 1:79 (95% CI: 1.45, 2.21) vs.
aPR = 1:33 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.63), respectively] and burning in the
nose, throat, or lungs [aPR = 1:82 (95% CI: 1.52, 2.19) vs.
aPR = 1:22 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.47) respectively], and only the latter
symptom had nonoverlapping confidence intervals (see Table
S2).
There was little difference in the associations between symp-
toms and dispersant use in analyses stratified by work location,
and the confidence intervals overlapped, although aPRs tended to
be higher among those who worked on the water away from the
wellhead than among those who did not work on the water and
those who worked near the wellhead (see Table S3). Exclusion of
participants reporting hair loss (n = 578, n = 612, and n = 617 for
respiratory, eye, and dermal symptoms, respectively) did not
materially change any of the PR estimates or confidence inter-
vals, although there was a nonsignificant positive association
between self-reported hair loss and dispersant exposure [aPR =
1:24 (95% CI: 0.95, 1.61)]. Similarly, excluding participants
whose only dispersant exposure was on land and who also
worked with cleaning chemicals did not affect the results, indicat-
ing that any potential misclassification resulting from confusing
cleaning chemicals with dispersants was minor. Exclusion of
nonworkers and exclusion of participants with invalid self-
reported dates of dispersant use also had negligible effects on the
results.
Stratification by the estimated maximum level of THC expo-
sure over all OSRC jobs did not reveal any meaningful differen-
ces in the associations between dispersant exposure and any of
the respiratory and eye irritation symptoms at the time of the spill
(see Table S4). Reported PPE use at any time during the OSRC
did not confound the association between dispersant exposure
and any of the respiratory or dermal symptoms at the time of the
spill, and there was no significant evidence of effect measure
modification among any of the respiratory symptoms.
For each symptom, the aPR was lower for symptoms present
at the time of study enrollment than for symptoms present at the
time of the OSRC (Table 4). However, dispersant exposure
remained significantly associated with the prevalence of symp-
toms at the time of study enrollment, with the exception of cough
and skin irritation.
Among participants who reported the presence of a given
symptom at the time of the OSRC, dispersant use remained sig-
nificantly associated only with burning eyes at the time of study
enrollment. However, among those participants who did not
report a given symptom at the time of the OSRC, dispersant use
was significantly associated with all outcomes except cough and
itching eyes at the time of study enrollment (see Table S5).
Exposure to dispersants was associated with a decreased likeli-
hood of reported skin irritation within 30 d of enrollment among
those who did not report skin irritation at the time of the spill.
Discussion
This study is the first to evaluate associations between potential
exposure to dispersants, specifically Corexit™ EC9527A or
EC9500A, and respiratory, eye irritation, and dermal symptoms

 both during the OSRC and at study enrollment 1–3 y later. OSRC
workers with potential exposure to either Corexit™ product were
more likely to have reported adverse symptoms at the time of the
spill. Previous studies have shown an association between expo-
sure to crude oil and adverse effects among spill responders
(Aguilera et al. 2010; Laffon et al. 2016), but no previous spill
involved this level of dispersant use or resulted in an investiga-
tion of potential associations between dispersant use and adverse
health effects. In vitro results suggested that 9527A and 9500A
may have adverse effects on human lung tissue (Major et al.
2016; Shi et al. 2013). Our results provide epidemiological evi-
dence to suggest that exposure to 9527A or 9500A may be asso-
ciated with adverse health effects, even after taking into account
exposure to the crude oil.
Based on the known irritant properties of chemicals in the dis-
persants, we hypothesized that there might be acute effects at the
time of the cleanup, but we did not expect there to be longer-term
effects at the time of enrollment. Although we observed associa-
tions between dispersant use and symptoms at both time points,
among participants with a given symptom at the time of the
OSRC, only increased prevalence of burning eyes at enrollment
remained significantly associated with dispersant exposure, con-
sistent with a lack of persistent effects of the dispersants. The sig-
nificant associations between exposure and symptoms at the time
of enrollment among those who did not have symptoms at the
time of the OSRC were unexpected and are difficult to explain.
Although it is possible that these associations are measuring
some latent effect of exposure to the dispersants, another possibil-
ity is that some of these symptoms may have been present at the
time of the OSRC but were not intense enough for the study par-
ticipants to recall 1–3 y later. The inverse association between
skin/clothing contact with dispersant during the OSRC and skin
irritation reported at the time of enrollment was also unexpected
and is difficult to explain. Many media reports at the time of the
study linked skin lesions with work or recreational activities
involving contact with water from the Gulf of Mexico (Marsa
2016; Landau 2010). We were unable to account for current rec-
reational contact with the water in this analysis.
As would be expected, direct work with dispersants was more
strongly associated with the respiratory and eye irritation out-
comes than indirect exposure through working in an area where
dispersants were used. Even so, for most symptoms, indirect ex-
posure was significantly associated with the symptom, indicating
that these likely lower exposures may also be important.
Stratification by airborne level of THC exposure showed no evi-
dence for effect modification by THC on the associations
between dispersant exposure and either respiratory or eye irrita-
tion symptoms.
The exposure measures used in this analysis were based on
self-reported responses to questions about work locations and
dispersant-related tasks and do not allow exploration of expo-
sure–response relationships. A quantitative job exposure matrix
for Corexit™ exposure that takes into account the chemical and
physical properties of the chemicals and external information on
patterns of use may allow evaluation of exposure–response rela-
tionships in the future.
The GuLF STUDY is the largest prospective study of OSRC
workers to date, and it provides an excellent opportunity to inves-
tigate less-common spill-related exposures and health outcomes
(Kwok et al. 2017). The detailed questionnaire provided the op-
portunity to assess previously understudied health effects associ-
ated with dispersants while also taking into account a wide
variety of potentially confounding factors.
However, our approach relied almost entirely on self-reported
data, which provides several opportunities for bias. When
possible, these potential sources of bias were investigated using a
variety of sensitivity analyses. One potential concern is the over-
reporting of symptoms. We addressed this concern by investigat-
ing the relationship between each exposure metric and self-
reported unusual amount of hair loss at the time of the spill,
which does not have any known biological relationship to expo-
sure to either 9527A or 9500A. The positive association between
dispersant
exposure
and
self-reported
excessive
hair
loss,
although not statistically significant, suggests the possibility of
bias due to over-reporting. However, excluding participants who
reported excessive hair loss did not meaningfully change the
results, suggesting that over-reporting does not explain our find-
ings. Similarly, exclusion of nonworkers did not result in a mean-
ingful difference in any of the results, indicating no appreciable
effect on the overall associations resulting from nonworkers
potentially having preexisting worse health than workers (i.e., a
healthy worker selection effect). Associations between dispersant
exposure and each outcome were somewhat stronger among
workers who spent time on the water away from the wellhead
than among workers who worked only on land or those workers
who worked near the wellhead. However, associations at all work
locations remained significant, providing evidence that the over-
all associations were not being driven by unmeasured characteris-
tics of a particular work location.
Misclassification of exposure is another potential problem
because of the reliance on self-reported information about the
work performed. For example, there was some evidence in open-
ended responses in the questionnaire that some participants were
confused by the term “dispersant” when responding to questions
about decontamination tasks. We attempted to address this issue
by excluding participants who reported only a land-based expo-
sure and also reported working on equipment decontamination.
The results of that analysis are qualitatively similar to the overall
results,
indicating that this potential misclassification was
unlikely to have played an appreciable role in our results.
It would be expected that the proper use of PPE would help
reduce received exposure and any potential adverse effects of this
exposure. The MSDSs for both dispersants recommend the use
of gloves and standard protective clothing, as well as the use of
respirators when concentrations exceed recommended limits
(NALCO 2012a, 2012b). Measurements taken by BP and by the
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
during the OSRC indicate that it is unlikely that airborne concen-
trations of either 2-butoxyethanol or propylene glycol exceeded
recommended limits (BP Gulf Science Data 2016c; NIOSH
2010). No measurements were available for airborne concentra-
tions of DOSS, nor were any dermal exposure measurements dur-
ing the OSRC available. Although we had no way to ascertain if
PPE was used specifically during dispersant-related tasks, a sen-
sitivity analysis among participants who reported PPE use during
the OSRC indicated no confounding of the main association by
reported PPE use, nor any effect measure modification among re-
spiratory outcomes.
Although our results suggest an association between exposure
to 9527A, 9500A, or both and adverse acute symptoms, we were
not able to completely distinguish these exposures. Participants
who were potentially exposed to 9527A, as identified by date and
method of use, reported slightly higher prevalence of most symp-
toms than those who would have been exposed to only 9500A.
Although this outcome could have been caused by the presence
of more acutely toxic agents in 9527A, a substantially larger
quantity of dispersants was applied during the early period of the
OSRC, when both dispersants were being used, than in the later
stages of the OSRC, when only 9500A was used (BP Gulf
Science Data 2016a, 2016b).

 Conclusion
Our findings suggest associations between exposure to disper-
sants, specifically Corexit™ EC9527A or Corexit™ EC9500A,
and adverse acute health effects at the time of the OSRC as well
as with symptoms that were present at the time of study enroll-
ment 1–3 y later.
